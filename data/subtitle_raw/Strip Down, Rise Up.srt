1
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:22,188
So I asked for truth,
and I asked for your erotic power

2
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,399
and that beautiful desire.

3
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,693
So I want you to really bring it.

4
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,030
Don't forget that's a thing
that's hard to show.

5
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:34,117
This is going to provoke you,
and it's going to make you surrender.

6
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,963
Thank you.
Thank you for being the first up.

7
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:50,467
If you think
about the society that we live in,

8
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,220
women are trapped
in the culture of the masculine.

9
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:59,476
There's so much global abuse of women.

10
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,815
Body-image shaming,
sexual abuse, and ego smashing.

11
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,819
There's a lot of shame
that women carry

12
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:14,199
because their body doesn't look
like that body on a magazine cover.

13
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,077
Finding your erotic body.

14
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,830
More Tiffany! More!

15
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,332
Hit them with your hips!

16
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,835
Just because someone is
dressing some way or looking sexy

17
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,921
doesn't mean that they're inviting you

18
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,589
to be sexual with them.

19
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,801
We've been shutting down
the feminine body,

20
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,636
curbing women's eroticism.

21
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:38,223
It is time for women
to step into their power,

22
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,266
and the time is now!

23
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,563
The way to step into that power
is through movement.

24
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,734
I believe that taking the pole
and reframing it

25
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:53,321
allows for personal reclamation

26
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,657
of the feminine body.

27
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,159
We like to talk
about how forward-thinking we are,

28
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,287
but the truth of the matter is,
the second you say "pole dancing,"

29
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,664
they immediately think

30
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:06,751
where men go smoke cigars, drink,
and women do lap dances for money.

31
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,629
And that's
just a part of what it is.

32
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,342
It's the world of pole.

33
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,179
It's pole dance, and it's pole artistry,

34
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,472
pole fitness,

35
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:21,933
pole sport.

36
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,519
It's different things to different people.

37
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,400
It's a journey of growth
and self-discovery.

38
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,944
I wanted to just get my mojo back.

39
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,908
I am in a war to help women
reclaim themselves.

40
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,994
When you enter my world,

41
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,956
you're gonna feel
like you walked into Fight Club for women.

42
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:49,169
And if you judge here,
I'm going to ask you to leave.

43
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,923
Baby, this is not for sissies.

44
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,243
Good morning.

45
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,755
I'm 50 years old.

46
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,216
I'm the mother of two children.

47
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,844
And I'm also a widow.

48
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:47,393
We are coming up
on now a year and eight months

49
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,271
since my husband passed.

50
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,190
There you go.

51
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,779
Anyone who knows me

52
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,573
knows that I'm always on the go,

53
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,116
out and about,

54
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,119
keeping busy all the time.

55
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,998
Losing my husband…

56
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,001
So much of me died with him.

57
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,298
I can go to work.
I can take care of my customers.

58
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,759
I can take care of the shop.

59
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,720
Once I'm back in the car,

60
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,181
there's no music.

61
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,016
There's no life.

62
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:34,357
Right now, the kitchen table
is not a kitchen table anymore.

63
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,442
It's piled with bills.

64
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,862
There's darkness everywhere.

65
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,367
Terry just wasn't my husband.
He was my best friend.

66
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,703
He was stepfather to my children.

67
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,039
I lost all of that in…

68
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,709
in one weekend.

69
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,130
I need to allow myself to be happy.

70
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,591
That's why I wanted to try S Factor.

71
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,219
I opened up the application,

72
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,180
and then I closed it and left it alone.

73
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,546
Something told me, "Go back."

74
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,101
"Just look at what it is."

75
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,980
I already was
a voice for this movement.

76
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,284
Created by actress
Sheila Kelley,

77
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:19,235
the S Factor is
Hollywood's hottest fitness trend.

78
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,072
I had already written a book.
I had been on the Oprah Show with S.

79
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,951
Sheila Kelley is back to show us
how to work the pole.

80
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,871
That happened
'cause Teri Hatcher, she was a student,

81
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,664
went on Oprah and showed some moves.

82
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,958
It's very much about empowerment.

83
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,044
There's all size women in the class.

84
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,338
It's not about
looking at yourself or being sexy.

85
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,090
It's about finding this place of comfort

86
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,675
and confidence in your own body.

87
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:46,179
Martha, come on!

88
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,556
Why is it called the S Factor?

89
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,684
It's called the S Factor
after the shape of a woman's body.

90
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:52,769
The curves of a…

91
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,438
the S kind of mimics
the shape of a woman's body,

92
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,441
as opposed to, like,
a man, who's more, like, of an H.

93
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,930
- We're an H? Oh!
- Well, you know...

94
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,694
Thanks a lot!

95
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,738
Women are an S!

96
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,531
Men are an H!

97
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,452
Oh, my God!

98
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:15,291
I knew
I had to separate it from this male gaze.

99
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,002
I talked about it as fitness,

100
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,421
as something you can do
to get in great shape.

101
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,965
Really, what S Factor is,

102
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,801
it's a lifestyle practice

103
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,220
designed for those that identify as women

104
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,264
to unlock the body
through sensual movement…

105
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,101
…and to learn

106
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:36,562
how it can bring you
into a better place in the world.

107
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,646
Okay.

108
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,191
When I realized that, I was like,

109
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,486
"Okay, I have to get this to women.
I want to get this to women."

110
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:55,647
Can you fill these out,
and bring it to me when you're done?

111
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,833
There's a pen right there.

112
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,464
All right, we're good.
We're awesome. Thank you.

113
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,217
- What's your name?
- Evelyn.

114
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,468
- Evelyn. Patty.
- Patty.

115
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,471
- Pleased to meet you.
- My middle name's Evelyn. I'm Violet.

116
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,995
- Violet.
- Nice to meet you.

117
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:15,226
- I'm traveling from Fontana.
- Oh! Is that far?

118
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,521
My goal is to climb the pole.

119
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,858
I'll be happy if I just get up to the top
and just wave at everybody.

120
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,110
I probably won't be waving,
but you know.

121
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,820
That's my goal, is to climb.

122
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,613
Evelyn.

123
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,031
- I'm Ava.
- Ava.

124
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,199
Elizabeth.

125
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,243
Right here,
we need your initials.

126
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,788
I am, like,
so not coordinated at all.

127
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,624
- You don't need to be.
- Super dork.

128
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,294
I haven't had a dance class
since I was in third grade.

129
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,451
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
- Same skills.

130
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,548
I guess... not sure what to expect.

131
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,217
- Yeah.
- You know? So it'll be interesting.

132
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,470
Hi!

133
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,637
How's it going?

134
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,222
Whoo!

135
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,599
Are you guys nervous?

136
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,589
- Yes.
- You guys are brave motherfuckers.

137
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,855
I'm gonna, um,
ask you to leave your shoes out here.

138
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:04,400
Come on in here.
Put your stuff on the bench here.

139
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:05,860
Hi!

140
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,864
Hair down, glasses off, and then
we're gonna sit in a little circle.

141
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,325
Wow! Look at this crew!

142
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,869
I wanna introduce you to Ali,

143
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,871
who will be co-teaching with me.

144
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:20,333
I'm Sheila, and it's my life mission

145
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,460
to help bring women back

146
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:24,128
into their wholeness.

147
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,340
So we're about to embark
on a six-month journey,

148
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:32,136
where we'll reconnect with our bodies
through sensual movement.

149
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,013
And we'll get to know each other,

150
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,307
even though we feel
like strangers right now.

151
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,100
It takes feeling safe.

152
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,437
That is why there's no mirrors,
and there's no judgement.

153
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,525
I wanna know your name, where you're from,
and what you're seeking here.

154
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,151
Who wants to go first?

155
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,904
I think what I wanna get out of this,

156
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,157
I've noticed recently
that I've stopped looking in the mirror…

157
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,660
particularly this region.

158
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,329
Sort of like the shame
of putting weight on.

159
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,624
There's never been a day in my life
where I felt sexy

160
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,710
or where I felt
like I accepted my body for what it was.

161
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,629
I've always been a tomboy.

162
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,506
I never really understand

163
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,425
the true meaning of what being a woman is.

164
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,179
I'm hoping this class will help that
and help me fall in love with myself,

165
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,057
'cause Lord knows I don't.

166
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,477
I recently lost my husband.
It's been a year and a half.

167
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,521
So, this is a big thing.

168
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,190
I want to embrace being intimate again,

169
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,441
even with myself,

170
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,111
because I let a lot go,

171
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,529
and I want it back.

172
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,282
- Yes!
- Let's do it. Shall we move?

173
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,079
So my girlfriend's
been coming to this,

174
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:44,125
and she's been opening up
and seeing the goddess in her,

175
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,169
and I'm just like, "I want some of that."

176
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,511
I have three children,
and my baby is 21 years old.

177
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,805
And so I kind of feel like I'm done

178
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,850
with the motherhood part of my life.

179
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,020
If I don't get on it,
I'm not gonna be able to.

180
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,610
As your head pulls
your whole body to the left…

181
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,321
Every other woman that I see,
she looks gorgeous to me.

182
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,947
I'm like, "Wow, she's pretty!"

183
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,949
But I can never see it in myself.

184
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,662
And I wanna find that confidence

185
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:26,000
and feel sexy and not compare myself
negatively to other women.

186
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,084
I look around here,

187
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,379
"Oh, my God, everybody's so pretty!
Like, what am I looking like right now?"

188
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,494
- So…
- She asked you a question.

189
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,259
- How is she looking?
- Yeah. How is she looking right now?

190
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,845
Super hot!

191
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,975
Every woman
that comes in the studio

192
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:46,187
has a side of herself that's been hushed.

193
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,566
The world has such incredible judgement

194
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,693
around anyone who carries excess weight.

195
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,488
I went through the process of,

196
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,741
"You're too this. You're too that.
You're not enough of this."

197
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,368
Growing up,

198
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:01,868
my father,

199
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,331
he used to call me "Hot Dog."
It was a nickname.

200
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,958
That one little thing just crushed me.

201
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,585
I developed early,

202
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,504
and everybody started noticing me.

203
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:15,508
And I was being called a slut
because of what I was born with.

204
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,678
I detached myself from it

205
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:22,765
because I didn't wanna be judged.
I didn't wanna be called names.

206
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,268
Why does being a voluptuous woman,

207
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,188
or even a slim woman with cellulite,

208
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:32,692
why is that a thing that cannot be loved

209
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,651
and beautiful?

210
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,031
I'm gonna teach you to walk.

211
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,825
S Factor style.

212
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,743
The first step of the walk

213
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,662
is to start to drag your toe

214
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:48,249
from back to front across your midline.

215
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,835
So my whole body is slithering along.

216
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,256
You're gonna stick your breasts out,
your shoulder blades back.

217
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:58,008
Pull your belly button in
to support your low back

218
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,427
'cause it arches.

219
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,928
And it doesn't matter.

220
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,514
You're not going
in a straight line or getting anywhere.

221
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,684
You're just enjoying how you get there.

222
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,977
That's the journey.

223
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,567
If a woman is feeling like,
"I can't dance…".

224
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,319
"I feel too awkward, too clumsy…"

225
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,487
Yeah!

226
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:23,367
…that's maddening 'cause it's not
like a "dance on the beat" kind of thing.

227
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,368
It's... no, it's…

228
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:29,165
it's all about releasing deep, deep pain

229
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,751
and deep trauma in your body.

230
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,919
So where's your curve right now?

231
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,507
Where's your…

232
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,496
Can I have your glasses?

233
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,386
Thank you.

234
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,003
- I can't see.
- It's great.

235
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,435
Kick your hip out. Just kick a hip out.

236
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,188
Let your hair go. Yeah.

237
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,981
You're like this vixen

238
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,775
who hides in this place,

239
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,902
which we don't want you
to hide there anymore. Okay?

240
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:58,985
So, how we gonna do it?

241
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,822
In the middle of 2015,
I was diagnosed with lupus.

242
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:06,202
So I had a reason
for why, um, I was frozen all the time.

243
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,870
To want to walk and not be able to,

244
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,288
to want to pick up a cup,

245
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,500
and you just couldn't do it.

246
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,127
So, I became very aware of movement,

247
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,296
and I want to explore that more.

248
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,133
Honestly, I don't have a crazy story.

249
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,219
I just wanted to try pole class.

250
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,722
And that's just something different, new.

251
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,474
I wanna shake my thing.

252
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,309
Whoo!

253
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,437
- This, to me, is a transformative journey.
- Yeah, I'm kind of getting that.

254
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,605
- Okay.
- So…

255
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,149
It's kind of intense. Yeah.

256
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,987
I'm like, "Wow, okay.
What did I get myself into?"

257
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,824
A lot. You got yourself
into the deep fucking end, baby!

258
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,369
I wasn't scared.
Now I'm, like, a little scared.

259
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:53,374
You're gonna hold
each other accountable to not giving up.

260
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,876
Emotion is gonna come up.
Fear is gonna come up.

261
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,838
Judgement is gonna come up.
You have to fight through it.

262
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,460
I'll tell you right now,
you're all gonna wanna quit.

263
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,886
You're all gonna go, "This is
too fucking intimate. This is scary."

264
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,264
And then if you are brave enough,

265
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,225
you'll continue forward
and reclaim yourself completely.

266
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,018
If you give in to it,

267
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,730
you will drift off and live
in a state of "Where the fuck am I?"

268
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,985
So, listen, I want you to look
across the circle at someone

269
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,737
and catch the eye of somebody,
and then point to her.

270
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,116
Does everybody have somebody?

271
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,452
I'm going that direction.
I can't actually see.

272
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,913
Is someone looking at her?

273
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,457
- You're my girl!
- Put your hand up. Okay.

274
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:39,295
That is your mirror for this journey.

275
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,298
She's gonna keep you
and hold you accountable,

276
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,050
and you're gonna create a sisterhood.

277
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:12,786
I never set out
or intended to be the founder

278
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,997
of a feminine movement practice.

279
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,957
Yeah. This is done.

280
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,547
I was preparing for a movie
where I was playing a stripper.

281
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,511
I became
fascinated by pole dance.

282
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,141
It felt so amazing

283
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,477
to be that overtly feminine.

284
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,273
When you have been offended constantly

285
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,109
and told what is right and wrong
to do with your body,

286
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,738
you start to take that inside,
and you start to self-offend.

287
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,700
I had an enormous amount of self-abuse.

288
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,037
I was diagnosed with anorexia.

289
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:56,789
I was a cutter.

290
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,793
This lifestyle and practice

291
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,419
has made me confront

292
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,297
all the things
that have made me self-conscious,

293
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,924
made me feel judged,

294
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,134
made me feel shut down.

295
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,012
One day,

296
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,517
I was dropping my son off at preschool,

297
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,394
and there was a knock on my window.

298
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,939
It was a mom
I didn't really know. She goes, um,

299
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,608
"I hear you do that pole dance."

300
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,945
And I'm like,
"Yeah, go get some six-inch heels."

301
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,571
"Come on over to my house."

302
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,365
So I started teaching.

303
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,909
Okay, it's ready.

304
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,828
Let's all sit.

305
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:39,289
My kids
came up against challenges,

306
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,709
being the mom with the poles in the house.

307
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:49,883
The mothers and the fathers would not
let their daughters come over here

308
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,511
because people think, you know,
"A strip club."

309
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,474
We needed that.

310
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,977
Can we start
every single meeting like that?

311
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,573
I eventually opened studios
in Chicago, San Francisco,

312
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,867
Los Angeles, Houston, and New York.

313
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,915
When I first started,

314
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:26,086
it just felt like freedom and release.

315
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,687
Even though I wasn't physically crying,

316
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,231
every dance was me crying.

317
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,279
I was just in a really,
really dark, dark place.

318
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,323
My relationship had ended.

319
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,658
I was really devastated.

320
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,203
It just felt like…

321
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,206
"I'm 38 years old,
I'm never gonna get married,

322
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,041
I'm never gonna have a baby,

323
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,126
it's never gonna happen for me."

324
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,547
I wanted to kind of reconnect with myself.

325
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,049
I was feeling very dejected.

326
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,718
I just wanted to feel
more sensual and more sexual.

327
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,846
When I first started,

328
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,810
a lot of what I went through was about
just feeling comfortable in my own skin,

329
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,687
feeling the sensuality in my body.

330
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,690
I didn't know there was a deeper journey.

331
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,610
There's a fight happening

332
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,446
between two erotic energies.

333
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,574
Between your lust and your fire

334
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,869
has been your fear, your pullback, right?

335
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,082
And what's coming is a lot of hope.

336
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,544
But I want the hope to bring the lust.

337
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,629
Don't leave the lust back there.

338
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,174
As a Black woman
in the workplace,

339
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,801
you encounter so many things

340
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,386
that will make you angry.

341
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:03,100
There's such a stigma
around this idea of the angry Black woman.

342
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,562
That's been something
that I really try to keep a handle on

343
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,773
because you know that people have
those kinds of perceptions

344
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,609
and that your anger is really not okay.

345
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,237
S Factor can be sort of a safe place

346
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,614
to explore that and try to express it.

347
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,101
I've been doing S Factor
for about eight years now.

348
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,709
A lot of it is about the deepness
of the relationships

349
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,878
that all these women have
with each other.

350
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,805
I went from believing
that pole dancing

351
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,057
was this very solitary thing

352
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,102
to discovering this huge family of people

353
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,021
who are open arms, embrace me,

354
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:52,024
and would celebrate
all of my wins with me.

355
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,027
Pole is an industry that is unique

356
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,237
because it is built by women.

357
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,701
The original pole studio owners

358
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,912
come from, like, an S Factor background,

359
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,915
or they were strippers,
and people wanted to learn their craft.

360
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,336
This creative industry
has been growing like crazy

361
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,671
because we built our business around,

362
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:19,343
"How does pole dancing help you become
empowered in the rest of your life?"

363
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,764
"How do you feel bigger and bolder
outside of the studio

364
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:27,184
because of the confidence
that pole dance instills in you?"

365
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,729
And that's really
the intoxicating part of pole.

366
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,448
I love competition.

367
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,785
I always want to win,
and that's just the way I am.

368
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,628
I'm also an attorney.

369
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,507
I currently practice pro bono family law.

370
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,550
You can be a pole dancer
and you can be a lawyer.

371
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,635
How cool is that?

372
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,806
I generally am known

373
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,059
as what, in the pole dance world,
we call a trickster.

374
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,479
I post a lot of tricks on social media.

375
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,398
I love teaching tricks.

376
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,943
In five weeks, I am competing

377
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,112
at the Golden Gate Pole Championship.

378
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,447
My reason for competing

379
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,075
has always been about telling stories.

380
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,745
Can I tell a story with my body

381
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,664
that I truly believe in,

382
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,250
that maybe other people
can relate to too?

383
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,926
I took
my very first pole dancing class,

384
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,179
and I was like,
"Oh, this will be such a nice hobby."

385
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,182
I don't know.
Maybe it was, like, an electric,

386
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,019
magnetic thing
in the stainless steel on the pole,

387
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,854
but as soon as I touched the pole,

388
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:57,607
I was like, "Oh, I love this."

389
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,569
I literally fly when I'm on the pole.

390
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,779
I'm flying. That's crazy.

391
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:07,159
I never would've believed
I could have done that five years ago.

392
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,585
- Amy, did you wash your hands?
- Yes.

393
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,039
Okay.

394
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,583
There she is. Talk to him.

395
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,667
Hi!

396
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,836
I'm the oldest of seven kids.

397
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,964
I was raised in the Mormon Church.

398
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:23,759
Being Mormon,

399
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,929
women owning their sexuality was something
that was really frowned upon.

400
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,599
You just pretend
that your sexuality doesn't exist.

401
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:34,478
And if you run into a moment
where it happens to exist for you,

402
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,981
you, like, say your prayers
and you ask for forgiveness for it.

403
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,400
I felt like a bad person

404
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,861
because of this lesson I'd had in my body

405
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,072
about being ashamed of my sexuality.

406
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:49,159
Like, is this really real?
Is this something I actually believe in?

407
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,165
When I started pole dancing,

408
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,750
I didn't tell anyone about it

409
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:00,712
because it was still
this weird underground thing.

410
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,841
I want to create a world
where you say that you pole dance,

411
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,260
and the first question
people ask you isn't,

412
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,179
"Oh, are you a stripper?"

413
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,139
It's, "Oh, that's really cool."

414
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,975
"I've heard that's really hard."

415
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,812
Yeah! Do it again! All right!

416
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,991
I own San Francisco Pole and Dance.

417
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,163
I wanted to create a space

418
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,456
where anybody can come,

419
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,583
and they're not ashamed to pole dance.

420
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:43,755
Whatever face my students put on for work,
they can take off when they come in here.

421
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,592
If they've got a belly
on top of their abs,

422
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,261
let it all hang out.

423
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:54,266
The reason we don't wear a lot of clothes
is because it helps you stick to the pole.

424
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,727
- All the way up.
- I tell my students,

425
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,939
"I know that you've been shamed
about your body for most of your life,

426
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,859
but I want you to take off
most of your clothes,

427
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,402
strip down to a bikini,

428
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,737
come out here
in front of full-length mirrors,

429
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,615
and I want you to try something
you've never done before

430
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,034
"and that you're
probably gonna be really terrible at."

431
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,203
That's a hard sell right there.

432
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,922
I'm gonna show you guys three, like,
tricksy things today.

433
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:28,341
We'll incorporate it and kind of break up

434
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,302
the tricks that we learn
with free dancing.

435
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,305
And face! Chest!

436
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,140
Belly! Hips!

437
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:38,685
And then you're gonna tuck your hips.
You're gonna sit down into it,

438
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,355
pulling your face in towards the pole.

439
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,486
Getting your pussy down to the ground.

440
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,238
I signed up
for the sexy choreography class

441
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,325
because I've never
been in shape or felt sexy.

442
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,995
I like doing things that terrify me,
and I swear, this thing terrified me.

443
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,788
Let's do this move together.

444
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,124
One, back.

445
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,792
Two, back.

446
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:03,960
Kick, drop.

447
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,212
Oh! You queen!

448
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,839
That was fucking awesome! That was great!

449
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,351
What is so exciting
about pole dancing

450
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,103
is it helps people, especially women,

451
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,065
rediscover their relationship
with their bodies.

452
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,405
Here's what you're gonna do.

453
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,283
Take your right hand or left hand,
whichever is dominant.

454
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:39,788
And you're going to stay
in that beautiful curvy walk,

455
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,207
and you're going to close the door.

456
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,167
And then you're gonna turn around.

457
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:50,757
Right?

458
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,926
I want you to think of the pole

459
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,720
as the frame of the artwork of your body.

460
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,139
It's not about the pole.

461
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,119
I'm from Ohio, originally.

462
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,996
I grew up doing gymnastics.

463
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,706
It just was my life.

464
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:27,669
When I was younger,
I was repeatedly sexually abused by

465
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:32,173
the ex-famed Olympic gymnastics doctor,
Larry Nassar,

466
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,050
but it was one of those things

467
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,594
that I stuffed away.

468
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,471
My whole life,
I just pretended like it never happened,

469
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,182
but it was always there.

470
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,435
I gotta breathe for a sec.

471
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,270
Um, but, you know, this...

472
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,980
You don't have to keep talking.

473
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,191
- You can just be.
- Okay. Okay.

474
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,075
Wow!

475
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,329
I was two when I started gymnastics,

476
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,080
and I fell in love with it,

477
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:06,833
and I immediately wanted
to be an Olympian.

478
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:11,171
I remember the 1996 Atlanta Olympics,

479
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,506
when Kerri Strug broke her foot.

480
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,134
That was such a big moment.

481
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,097
All right, Meg.

482
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,392
I gave up everything for it.

483
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:27,520
I didn't have friends
or a social life or anything.

484
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,564
Yeah! Good job, Meg!

485
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,858
When I was 15,

486
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,986
I ended up having
three stress fractures in my back.

487
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,907
As a gymnast,
what you're told by your coaches is,

488
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,117
"No pain, no gain. Push through it."

489
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:45,664
So I pushed, and I trained
on those fractures for six months…

490
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,792
and I couldn't walk
'cause there was just so much spasming,

491
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,753
and, like, my body was just so contracted

492
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,630
and trying to protect itself.

493
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:58,635
We went to a few doctors.
They couldn't find what was wrong,

494
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,470
and so when we found Larry Nassar,

495
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,263
it was like a godsend

496
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,723
that he knew what was wrong

497
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,975
and could treat it.

498
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,354
This is a famous doctor.

499
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,565
All of my heroes saw him.

500
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,902
When Kerri Strug broke her foot,

501
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,446
little do people realize
that it was Larry Nassar

502
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,407
holding his hand out for her.

503
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,871
He would sort of start this massage,

504
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,749
and he'd sort of
work his way up in your inner thighs.

505
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,334
And then he'd camouflage

506
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,795
by standing in between my mom and I,

507
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,589
and he would have one hand massaging,

508
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,135
and then the other
would just aggressively go in.

509
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,638
And it was painful.
It hurt. I'd walk out of there sore

510
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,557
every single time.

511
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,767
It was… it was really intense.

512
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,313
I knew from day one
that something was wrong,

513
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,733
but I was too scared.

514
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,985
I was terrified.

515
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,988
I was terrified to say something.

516
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,782
I didn't even know
that area of my body yet.

517
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,871
This past year has been awful.

518
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,831
I just kind of stopped living

519
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,792
because I started to deal with it.

520
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,128
And I went to therapy,
and I was proactive,

521
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:18,381
but I don't know…
you know, I… I don't know who I am.

522
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,968
You're put on this Earth
to be life force,

523
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,928
and this culture we live in

524
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:25,972
just robs it from the feminine.

525
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,932
And I am no longer okay with it.

526
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:32,771
So thank you for joining me on this crazy,
crazy amazing journey of reclamation.

527
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,272
We'll… we'll get there, okay?

528
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,128
Just wanna talk to you
about what you're gonna bring next week.

529
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,319
Shoes.

530
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:42,071
Six-inch to eight-inch shoes.

531
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:46,075
These shoes are gonna start
to tell you about yourself.

532
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,495
They will tilt your pelvis
another 30 degrees

533
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,288
and make the curve even louder.

534
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:54,459
They're also gonna allow your body
to be more heightened in her sexuality.

535
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,671
Miss Evelyn. Yeah?

536
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,299
What's going on?

537
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,677
My husband, Terry…

538
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,847
March 6th was a year and a half

539
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,307
that he's been gone.

540
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:14,771
Around that time,
I put my wedding ring back on

541
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,190
'cause I took it off.

542
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,235
Let the sob happen.
Just sob for a second.

543
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,737
There's no shame here.
There's no cutting back the sobbing.

544
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,447
- No, I...
- You're grieving.

545
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,408
But what your body needs to do
is move emotion through it.

546
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,746
But it's such an ugly cry.

547
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,541
Oh, my God!

548
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,846
No,
I don't mean it's ugly.

549
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,420
Yeah, it's probably ugly
in the face, but I mean…

550
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,422
this is a cry I've never…

551
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,384
…I've not experienced.

552
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:48,429
And I know it's different,
and I hear it in the echoes in my house.

553
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,390
And it's horrible.

554
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,519
Put your hand
where he is right now in your body.

555
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:55,436
I'm sorry?

556
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,065
Put your hand on where he is in your body.
Where do you feel him most?

557
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,402
- Right here.
- Right here?

558
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,071
I want you to just move it.

559
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,574
I don't want you to feel…
I don't want you to talk anymore.

560
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,409
I want you to move your body.

561
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,038
I don't think I can.

562
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,418
Let that hand
and that arm soothe you right now.

563
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,878
If that's where he is,

564
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,006
let that arm soothe you.

565
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,890
You know how to do this. Breathe.

566
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,058
Breathe.

567
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,393
Let it move you.

568
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,645
Have a dance right now.

569
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,482
Come on. Come on.

570
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,193
Move toward me with your breath.

571
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,613

572
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,657

577
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,711

Yes!

582
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,141
Yeah!

583
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,142
Yes!

584
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:27,904
Keep moving.
Put his… on your… that arm, yes!

585
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,948

588
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,918
Good!
Now, you're gonna go all the way back.

589
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,474
It's okay to be happy again.

590
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,435
Thank you for trusting us.

591
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,230
It's been a long time
since I could trust.

592
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,439
So, thank you.

593
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:11,239
Even though
you're not therapists, you, as teachers,

594
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,658
are providing an experience

595
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,911
that is extremely healing
in a therapeutic way.

596
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,247
But you wanna be extra careful,

597
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,418
because if you're triggering
PTSD reaction,

598
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,628
call her over after class
and connect with her.

599
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,505
"Are you seeing a therapist

600
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,908
to give you the support
that we're not equipped to give you

601
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:32,677
but that you really need,
not only to get the most out of the class,

602
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,512
but to do your healing?"

603
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:37,974
Sheila asked me to come in
and just brief you,

604
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,309
make sure you feel confident

605
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,146
working with women
who have a trauma history,

606
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,064
or maybe trauma is coming out
right now…

607
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,191
I have a student in my class

608
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,861
that had sexual trauma
at a very young age.

609
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,725
So what do you see?

610
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,657
- Hesitation, locked body.
- Mmm-hmm.

611
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,995
The key with trauma recovery
is shame release

612
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,665
in the process of reclaiming

613
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:06,169
your sexuality on your terms at your pace

614
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,254
because the power was
taken away from you,

615
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,840
and shame was put in that place.

616
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,801
Shame will hold you prisoner,

617
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:18,139
but really all shame wants is to come
into the light and be let go.

618
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,724
"You no longer serve me."

619
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:29,734
This movement will bring you
into such an incredible state of peace

620
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,819
and ownership again.

621
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,162
It's amazing how pole can be
so many different things

622
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,580
to so many different people.

623
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:49,003
You have your pole competitions
that are more about winning and losing.

624
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,130
They're about performance.

625
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,889
I have a PhD in theoretical physics
and neuroscience.

626
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,934
I got into it to fix my spine.

627
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,322
My schools are focused
on building good technical training

628
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,449
with an eye towards competition.

629
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:24,497
The hands are, like,
making this whole thing. It looks awesome.

630
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,548
Don't lose your audience,
since you're telling them a story.

631
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,258
- You gotta keep eye contact.
- Okay.

632
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,929
You have professional performers
like Jenyne Butterfly,

633
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,348
who do pole
at shows like Cirque du Soleil.

634
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:47,395
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jenyne Butterfly!

635
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,572
My name is Jenyne,

636
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,949
also known as Butterfly.

637
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,576
I'm an aerialist

638
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,871
specializing in pole artistry.

639
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:09,000
I recently performed five years
with Cirque du Soleil.

640
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,087
And I am also a mother.

641
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,720
When I was 18,

642
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,681
I was brought to a gentlemen's club

643
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,727
where the best pole dancer
in the country performed.

644
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,938
Her name was Pantera.

645
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,567
She was very intimidating.

646
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,404
I could not believe what I was watching.

647
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,576
She would go up and do a lay-back
and then do crunches,

648
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,204
and then she would spin around really fast

649
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,331
and then drop down

650
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,750
and then do one-handed push-ups on stage.

651
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,170
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

652
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:57,006
So I started
working at the club as a waitress.

653
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,800
I had set down my tray

654
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,845
and went to go, you know,
try some stuff on the pole.

655
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,180
I couldn't do anything.

656
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:07,433
And Pantera walked by and saw me.

657
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,894
She said, "You need boots to climb."

658
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,356
She actually gave me a pair of boots.

659
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:15,066
I ripped the boots.

660
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:17,485
Then I realized
that I had to build strength.

661
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,906
I was self-taught.

662
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,285
I try to spend my time mostly in the air

663
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,912
because I'm really clumsy.

664
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,624
I'm only graceful when I'm in the air.

665
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,003
I decided to stop going to college

666
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,922
and really focus on my training.

667
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,925
Pole became a priority.

668
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:46,138
I ended up going
to the World Pole Dancing Championship,

669
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,099
where I represented the US.

670
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,854
That's when things
really started picking up in my career.

671
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,417
There's so much freedom in pole.

672
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,423
The second my feet come off the ground,

673
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,759
I am in another world.

674
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,471
There's no right and wrong
in pole.

675
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,598
There's just focus

676
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,477
and the connection with my body.

677
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,355
It's therapy.

678
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,065
It's a release.

679
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,610
You shut out everything else that's
happening in your life,

680
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,529
and you focus on yourself.

681
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,658
It helps you become healthier.

682
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,870
It gives you strength,
and it gives you flexibility.

683
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,747
Good. There you go.

684
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,916
It doesn't matter
how long it takes you.

685
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,086
You will develop everything that you need

686
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,047
to be able to lift yourself.

687
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,759
You can just start
by taking one class a week.

688
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,719
You know, get off the couch.

689
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,722
When I started pole dancing,

690
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,850
it was still fairly new.

691
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,894
There wasn't anything

692
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,479
as a pole dance instructor.

693
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,900
So when I heard that it was on the news,

694
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,652
I said, "What? This is amazing!"

695
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,322
It was Sheila Kelley.

696
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,952
I thought, "Wow, that's really amazing,
how she's taking it out

697
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,997
and making it available
for so many women."

698
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,625
She's doing this beautiful thing with it

699
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:41,295
that I knew was a part of pole,

700
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,840
but it was the part
that I had really looked over.

701
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,680
I felt like
we were going along similar paths,

702
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:55,226
but I was going the performance route,
and she was going the teaching route.

703
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,232
I'm not gonna teach you
to do what I do.

704
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,859
I'm gonna teach you to do
what your body wants to do,

705
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,861
how your body moves

706
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:09,115
into your pleasure and your desire.

707
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,952
That's the whole premise of what I teach.

708
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,664
I want women to feel safe enough
to explore this part of themselves

709
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,374
so that they can rediscover,

710
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,376
reclaim, and come whole,

711
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,837
and fucking shine!

712
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,140
<i>♪ Hey, we're just here to have fun now ♪</i>

713
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:37,059
<i>♪ Livin' life on the high
We can't come down ♪</i>

714
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,144
Whoo!

715
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,276
I need orthopedic stilettos.

716
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,236
A demure heel.

717
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,696
It's a classic stiletto.

718
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,114
This could kill somebody!

719
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,200
I'm more of a Converse girl.

720
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:57,163
Hey, look! Dude!
They have something for everyone!

721
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,373
They've got something for everyone.

722
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,753
- All right.
- Get up. Ready?

723
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,966
Wow, the air is different up here.

724
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,678
Oh, yes!

725
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,013
Oh, yeah!

726
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,807
- S Walk!
- I don't know that I can do it.

727
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:18,601
I wanted to…

728
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,187
I feel like I'm walking down the aisle.

729
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,441
I am already getting there.

730
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,524
Whoa!

731
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,862
Walk it straight. One, two, one…

732
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,618
- Hi!
- Hi!

733
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,101
- Hi!
- Feels a lot bigger.

734
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,038
Brought my gloves.

735
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,707
Whoo!

736
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,959
- Neat!
- I was, like, really excited.

737
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,462
- Yeah!
- These have been, like…

738
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,297
I'm surprised there's no cobwebs, but…
yeah.

739
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,886
Yeah.

740
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,137
No.

741
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,808
There's tons of pole dancing,
stripper things on Hollywood Boulevard.

742
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,269
I went to, like, 20 places, literally.

743
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,938
They had nothing that fit me.

744
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,689
"Put on a thong," and I can't wear thongs

745
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,493
because they get lost
in my butt.

746
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,944
And I'm like… I'm just like…

747
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,280
I'm so fucking pissed off and angry.

748
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,866
And I was like, "Fuck this class."

749
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,284
"Fuck everyone else in it."

750
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,454
No offense to you guys, but I was like…

751
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,748
But I'm, like, in the mirror, seeing this.

752
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,626
And I remember I'm going on the pole,
and it's, like, wrapping around,

753
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,212
and I was just like,
"I don't wanna do this."

754
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,214
"I just feel gross,

755
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,674
and I wanna feel sexy,

756
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,717
but I feel disgusting."

757
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,052
Fucking gorgeous.

758
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:38,764
- Are you sick and tired yet?
- Yeah, which is why I'm here.

759
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:41,267
Right now, you're living
with the critical masculine mind.

760
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:45,020
The critical masculine mind sees the world
with the critical masculine gaze

761
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,480
that measures everything.

762
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,941
Baby! Keep going! Go, go, go!

763
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:52,611
All the tools I'm gonna give you
are tools that teach the body,

764
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,488
and the body will teach the mind

765
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,572
if you let it.

766
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,910
A lot of what you learn
in your level-one intro class

767
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,288
is about appreciating your curves.

768
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:05,124
A lot of the cues they give you,
say things like,

769
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,375
"Stroke your tummy."

770
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,460
And I didn't wanna do it. I…

771
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,837
I hate my tummy.

772
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,755
And then I just had this realization of,

773
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,466
"Gosh, if you can't touch your tummy,
who will?"

774
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,720
What we're doing is
we're changing patterns in your body.

775
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,972
- Anyone immediately feel a difference?
- Yeah.

776
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,682
Hands. I wanna see hands. Hold 'em up.

777
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,892
It's just, to me, it's so similar…

778
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,104
I don't… I can't even talk now.

779
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,732
Lisset, what is happening?

780
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,401
I had a very emotional week.

781
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,696
I would look at my dog, and I'm like,
"Oh, you love me so much!"

782
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,117
I felt very open,
like I've been cracked open,

783
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,536
and I can feel everything and everyone.

784
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,913
I've always had a tough exterior,

785
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:48,959
so moving my body,
I could feel certain things activate

786
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,461
and just started crying.

787
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,381
I never wear my hair up.
I've always worn it down.

788
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,592
I feel like I use it
as a defense mechanism.

789
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,887
It deflects attention from my features,

790
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,264
but at work,
I actually wore my hair up twice.

791
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,788
It sounds silly to people
who wear their hair up all the time.

792
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,144
I felt confident enough to do it. Sorry.

793
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:10,189
Uh, for the first time
in a very long time.

794
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,690
Um…

795
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,275
Do yourself a favor,

796
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,027
and don't wipe the tears.

797
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,612
Um… sorry.

798
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,156
It's natural!

799
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,639
- That's a pattern.
- Yeah.

800
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,076
- Pattern of apology.
- Yeah.

801
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,620
I'm happy
I have all of you, by the way.

802
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,294
Amber,
you felt a difference. Don't lie.

803
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,755
I had zero idea,

804
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:37,216
like, what a prude I was.

805
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:40,010
I mean…

806
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,095
I've run marathons.

807
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,180
I've been an athlete my entire life.

808
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,641
There is nothing that I haven't done.

809
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,060
I left and I was like…

810
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:54,942
I started crying, and I was like,
"I am so much lamer than I thought I was."

811
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,486
My first thing was, like,
"Okay, I'm gonna quit."

812
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,613
Yeah, you said,
"You're gonna want to quit."

813
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,115
I'm not a crier.

814
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,410
Like, I did not expect
that I was gonna ugly cry in the car.

815
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:07,037
Maybe the tears are a beautiful thing.

816
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,580
Well, you didn't see 'em. It wasn't…

817
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,375
It wasn't like…

818
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:14,628
There was… it was like…
there was some snot involved.

819
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,673
- It was not pretty.
- Know what? I'm gonna keep pushing at you.

820
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,925
I don't wanna cry in here,
but, like, okay.

821
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,344
Amber, you excel at masculine shit.

822
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,721
You're a good little man.

823
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,930
Yeah.

824
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,975
But you ain't never gonna be
as good a man as a man,

825
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:30,018
but you're gonna be
a phenomenal fucking woman.

826
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,895
Mmm-hmm.

827
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:34,773
I think
I'll be here next week? We'll see.

828
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,024
Okay, sweetie.

829
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:40,362
What I struggle with a lot
is disassociating from my body.

830
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:43,157
Like, it just doesn't seem
part of me ever.

831
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,452
Which parts of your body
scare you the most?

832
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:50,164
I… I think, like,
my heart and what my heart wants, and…

833
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,708
my feminine areas.

834
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,042
Your vulva?

835
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,757
Yeah, vulva.

836
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,800
Someone stole that from you,

837
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,844
and we need to re-own it, reclaim it.

838
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,139
Yeah, I was thinking back to, like,
the first time I started

839
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,558
to dissociate with my vulva

840
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,852
and learn about that part of my body.

841
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,812
And I was taught from a young age

842
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,063
that this was just bad,

843
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,440
and sexuality was bad.

844
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:19,359
And that pisses me off
that I was conditioned that way.

845
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,321
It just… like, it makes me red with rage.

846
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:26,200
And that's okay. Not only is it okay,
we wanna release the kraken.

847
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,283
Yeah.

848
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,954
What are we doing, Jenn?

849
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,831
So,
we're gonna walk around the pole.

850
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:36,043
Using your half-pint, you're gonna pivot
up on to your left foot.

851
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:38,253
Cross your left hand across.

852
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,756
Bring that to the right,
and go all the way back here.

853
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,973
Once you're here,
you've already done half the work.

854
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:53,435
The only thing to do now
is to hold your grip

855
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,729
and bring your other leg behind you.

856
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:02,319
- So sad.
- No, that was awesome!

857
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,574
Whoo!

858
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:13,539
Work it!

859
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,671
I have never done that!

860
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:22,172
Whoo!

861
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,675
Next week, you're gonna go up two feet.

862
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,802
And then the week after,
you'll be all the way up.

863
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:27,719
Yes!

864
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,222
Upper body strength, gotta get that.

865
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,896
When I first started,
it was as a student.

866
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:42,234
Sheila tapped me in. She's like,
"You should become a teacher."

867
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:45,112
I'm like, "Oh, my gosh. She's crazy.
There's no way I can teach."

868
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,989
But I was totally enthralled,

869
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,741
came back, signed up
for teacher training, and taught,

870
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,619
and then became the events director.

871
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,454
And it became a mission in my life

872
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:58,500
to give women
another opportunity, as I had.

873
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,002
- Ready?
- Ready.

874
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:01,712
- Am I in now?
- Yeah, you're in.

875
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,005
Ooh! Oh!

876
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,172
That was stressful.

877
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,258
Oh! Whoa!

878
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,803
See that? Oh, no!

879
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,430
When I was 13,

880
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:16,476
that was, like, the beginning
of just a slow downfall in my life.

881
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,521
- Yes!
- You're out.

882
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,274
I was short-tempered.
Some people called me a monster.

883
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:25,527
I felt like I was misunderstood.

884
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,947
I lost touch with my body.

885
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,742
I stopped loving her.

886
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,870
I went into a raging spiral.

887
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,122
I started putting on weight.

888
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,665
Then I would take it off.

889
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:43,211
It's been a rise and fall of 40,
50 pounds.

890
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,255
And then I had my children,

891
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,591
so I added another 60 pounds.

892
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:50,761
Now, I'm over 100 pounds overweight.

893
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,639
I've stopped taking care of myself.

894
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,392
What's on the dinner menu tonight?

895
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:02,064
Well, since the vines finally,
uh, bloomed a little bit,

896
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,941
I figure we can make tamales.

897
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,653
Does it bother me
if she's overweight?

898
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,364
You know, um…

899
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,450
it's… it's a health thing.

900
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,566
I know she's beautiful,
and she knows she's beautiful,

901
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:19,414
but there is inherent negativity out there

902
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,667
when someone is overweight.

903
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,420
I could go and teach an S Factor class

904
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:27,381
and then go to McDonald's
right afterwards…

905
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,925
or go all day without eating

906
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,219
and then come home and do a sweet binge.

907
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:36,014
I wasn't practicing
what I'm preaching in class.

908
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,519
The idea of looking in the mirror,

909
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:43,563
I feel like Roger Rabbit,
that girl on Roger Rabbit.

910
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,817
She's voluptuous, and just sexy,

911
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,320
and furious, and just, like… ugh.

912
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,573
Radiant, then I stand in front of the
mirror, I'm like, "You fat motherfucker."

913
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,951
"Who are you? Get out of my mirror!"

914
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:00,330
My body was just screaming for freedom.

915
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,710
It wasn't until I started moving my body

916
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,254
and coming to terms with my rage,

917
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:11,341
listening to that vibrating
muscle exertion music

918
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,260
that allowed me to really release

919
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,262
instead of hitting walls.

920
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,806
Uh-uh. You're letting her win.

921
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:21,018
They've gotta fight inside,
and you don't let that happen.

922
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,729
Uh-uh! I can't hear it!

923
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:30,652
I just had
a lot of oomph and aggression,

924
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,612
and I didn't know what to do with it.

925
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,365
But rage is always with me.

926
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:36,907
Yes!

927
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,581
Yeah!
Feel the battle inside!

928
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,666
Feel the fight inside!

929
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,470
Whoo!

930
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:01,641
I'm ready to look in the mirror
and see what everybody else sees.

931
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,895
- That was, um, massive.
- Thank you.

932
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,354
- Massive.
- Thank you.

933
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,440
Do you know what I… it was a rebirth.

934
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:09,524
Okay.

935
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:12,319
Within this community,

936
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,238
there is such a level of truth because…

937
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:18,950
"I just saw you dance,
so I know you're not fine."

938
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:26,958
I had an experience of molestation
from a family friend.

939
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,711
It's a hard thing when you feel

940
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,421
that no one is protecting you.

941
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,924
One of the great gifts of S Factor

942
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,717
is figuring out a way

943
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:38,220
to move through sadness,

944
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:40,305
to feel your emotion

945
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,350
but not let it drown you.

946
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,896
When I first felt that lump,

947
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:50,440
I knew that I most likely had cancer.

948
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:58,532
I'm becoming
a second-time mother here soon,

949
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:03,662
and the fear of losing myself

950
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:06,331
in that first year of motherhood.

951
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,710
And it feels terrifying and isolating.

952
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:17,217
I went through sadness.
I went through anger.

953
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,886
I lost my breasts. I lost my hair.

954
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,055
And for most women,

955
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,015
those are the two body parts

956
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,892
that are so strongly tied

957
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,561
to our femininity.

958
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,815
Having that dance was

959
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:34,484
about how lonely it feels

960
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,695
and feeling sometimes

961
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:39,489
like you just have to scream

962
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,575
and knock down walls, and…

963
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,119
I don't know.

964
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:47,122
Destroy things in order to be heard.

965
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:54,004
My teacher asked me
to touch my head,

966
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:56,381
and I was grossed out and disgusted,

967
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:57,966
and I couldn't do it.

968
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,636
The moment
where she had me touch my head,

969
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,638
that was the most powerful moment

970
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,682
I have ever shared with a friend

971
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,100
in my entire life.

972
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,358
You made this.

973
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:20,405
Oh, this is humiliating.

974
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:23,742
It's so cathartic.
Just let it keep coming out, baby.

975
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:28,163
To have a place

976
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,207
that taught me a vocabulary

977
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,168
to move through the myriad of emotions

978
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:35,420
that comes with being cut open,

979
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:36,796
having that gift

980
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,007
was especially meaningful.

981
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:41,635
That's why I believe

982
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,845
that I danced my way through cancer.

983
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,359
Here.

984
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,572
The majority of my time is focused

985
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,450
around training for competition.

986
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,994
I've got 32 students

987
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,537
and six instructors competing

988
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,331
at the Golden Gate Pole Championship,

989
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,582
myself included.

990
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,126
Okay. Sit back all the way.

991
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,586
Mmm!

992
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,420
Yeah.

993
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,967
Breathe in. More. Okay. Now…

994
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,761
I think that discipline
and that will to succeed

995
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,471
comes from my parents.

996
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,141
My dad was a lieutenant colonel
in the Marines.

997
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:33,645
My mom was in the first class of women
to graduate from West Point.

998
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:39,192
When I was 19, I ran away from home

999
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,319
and I moved to Los Angeles.

1000
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,949
I really wanted to be an actress.

1001
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,410
I didn't know how to act.
I didn't know how to sing.

1002
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:52,038
I didn't know how to do anything,
but I had a lot of confidence…

1003
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,124
…that I was just gonna be amazing,

1004
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,711
and then I was gonna walk into an audition
or be discovered in a mall.

1005
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,212
You know, like, very cliché.

1006
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,882
I'd saved up maybe, like, $2,000,

1007
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:06,177
and very quickly ran out of that money.

1008
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:09,431
I'll pay you $25 an hour
to do nude modeling.

1009
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,890
Oh, this is nude modeling?

1010
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,350
You don't have to do it.

1011
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:15,770
I only make
six dollars an hour babysitting, so…

1012
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,106
Start by taking off your top.

1013
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,735
Lack of funds led me to nude modeling,

1014
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:25,947
and then nude modeling
led to working in the porn industry.

1015
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,825
Who's this gorgeous face
here before my lens?

1016
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,493
My name is Wendy James.

1017
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,705
Wendy James.
Tell us, Wendy, how old are you?

1018
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,041
I'm old enough.

1019
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:37,792
Old enough.

1020
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,587
I was still a virgin
when I started porn.

1021
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:44,007
And it wasn't until I was in the industry

1022
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:47,635
that I learned,
"Oh, sexuality can be an okay thing!"

1023
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:51,583
- Do your friends know what you do?
- Of course, they don't! Are you kidding?

1024
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,352
I lied to a lot of people

1025
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:58,938
and kind of lived
this double life for a long time.

1026
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,441
I was desperate enough.

1027
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:06,571
I also didn't want to admit
to the people I love that I was failing.

1028
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,203
I had a lot of shame
about what I was doing

1029
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:16,206
because I was still going
to church and doing porn.

1030
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,335
I was tithing on my porn money

1031
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,712
like that somehow made it okay.

1032
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,672
I told myself I was like Robin Hood.

1033
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,759
I was, like, taking from the bad
and giving to the good,

1034
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:29,594
which is ridiculous.

1035
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:35,225
My two worlds collided
when two of the Mormon elders…

1036
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,685
they're literally called "the patriarchy…"

1037
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:40,855
they met me in the parking lot
before the service.

1038
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,776
They told me they knew what I was doing,
and I got really embarrassed,

1039
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:46,778
and I never went back to church.

1040
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,865
I got punished
because someone saw me in a porn video.

1041
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,200
They were watching it,

1042
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:53,993
but they didn't get punished.

1043
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,831
After six months, I got out of porn.

1044
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:58,914
Okay.

1045
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,544
I started waitressing,

1046
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,712
and people started to realize

1047
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:07,924
I was Wendy James in porn movies.

1048
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:09,592
They'd call me a whore,

1049
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,679
and they would tell me
that I was a cum dumpster.

1050
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:17,725
There would be these men
who would come into the restaurants,

1051
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:20,478
and they'd be out with their kids
and their wives.

1052
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,524
I would get a receipt back saying,

1053
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,110
"I've seen how you give great head."

1054
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,238
"Meet me in the parking lot at 10:00 p.m."

1055
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:35,493
I would have my co-workers walk me out
to my car so that I would be safe.

1056
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:39,914
I really wondered
if there was a life for me after porn.

1057
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:42,667
"Should I go back?"

1058
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,919
"Is this all I can be now…

1059
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:48,506
because I spent six months working
in this industry?"

1060
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,385
It was a really dark moment
and it was really sad.

1061
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:55,722
It took me four years

1062
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,099
to get through community college

1063
00:57:58,183 --> 00:57:59,934
and transfer to Berkeley.

1064
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:01,518
When I got there,

1065
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,688
I felt like I was starting over.

1066
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:06,524
I was like,
"Okay, this is a new world now."

1067
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:10,028
"I'm using my mind.
It's not about using my body anymore."

1068
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,699
I go to Ralphs that night
to pick up some groceries.

1069
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:18,203
And the first thing
the checkout guy says is,

1070
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,997
"Oh, hey! Are you Wendy James?"

1071
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,834
And I'm like,
"No! It's gonna follow me forever!"

You're gonna enter intermediate

1077
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:43,436
And then after July,
when we do the ceremony,

1078
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,148
that's gonna be a ritual to take you
into your advanced practice here.

1079
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:50,818
We'll be taking flower petals.
We'll do this dancing a bit at the ocean.

1080
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:53,655
So, really quickly, just to review,

1081
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:57,116
it's right hand up, left hand here.

1082
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,495

Inversion is kind of freaky.

1097
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:33,319
You're gonna bring your knees to chest.

1098
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,738
Let your head come back.

1104
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,092
So, here's the thing, gals.

1105
00:59:56,759 --> 01:00:00,555
You are just starting to awaken
what we call your "erotic creature."

1106
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:04,017
So what you're gonna do is
you're gonna take your walk

1107
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,476
over towards the wall.

1108
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,061
I'm gonna reach up,

1109
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,439
and then I'm gonna do a wall push

1110
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:11,024
all the way back.

1111
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,652
Yes, Evelyn! Beautiful!

1112
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,614
I'm a plus-size woman.

1113
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,283
There's judgement,

1114
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,410
but in here.

1115
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:24,662
I don't feel different.

1116
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,247
The door closes.

1117
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:27,790
The music turns on,

1118
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:30,168
and I feel we're the same.

1119
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,463
That's what I wanna get from this journey.

1120
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:36,341
I want to carry it, so it leaves with me.

1121
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,873
Breathe.

1122
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,763
In through your nose.
Out through your mouth. Okay?

1123
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,851
- What was overwhelming?
- I just felt really uncomfortable,

1124
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:50,355
like I don't belong here and,
"What the fuck? Why am I here?"

1125
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:53,274
"You're not pretty enough,
not this, not that. You'll look stupid."

1126
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,984
And I just got really…

1127
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,570
But you were called
to put this on your body,

1128
01:00:57,654 --> 01:01:01,157
which means that she's dying to be here
and dying to be seen.

1132
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,851
I'm the one
flying from Utah every Sunday.

1133
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,228
It's fun to be here

1134
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:34,482
getting on such a high vibration
that I'm just absolutely craving

1135
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:36,442
and loving and wanting more of.

1136
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:39,028
But then to go home and…

1137
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:43,866
I don't understand how to explain this

1138
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,494
to my very conservative family.

1139
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,372
When people see this,

1140
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:53,668
it'll be perceived
as my one-way ticket to hell.

1141
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,421
And so that's my struggle right now.

1142
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:58,715
Does your husband know what you're doing?

1143
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:01,259
I think he knows
a little bit about it, but…

1144
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,762
I don't know how to share it.

1145
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,973
Did you sit him in a chair
and do a lap dance?

1146
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,392
Fuck no!

1147
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,644
Okay, you have an assignment.

1148
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,981
Yeah!

1149
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:19,235
Next time I see you, you will have done
at least one lap dance for him.

1150
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:21,279
So that will explain it to him.

1151
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:23,072
That I learned how to lap dance?

1152
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:26,492
If you do it the way we're teaching you,
which is for your pleasure,

1153
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,578
he's gonna feel a free woman.

1154
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:32,123
I have the same struggle,

1155
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,625
but the thing is
my family don't watch Netflix.

1156
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,961
So, I don't have…

1157
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:39,422
I don't have to tell them.

1158
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:44,010
So, it's my secret
I am taking to the grave.

1159
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:53,352
My husband
is an executive at Microsoft.

1160
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:56,147
He calls me "Wonder Woman."

1161
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,900
He believes I can do anything.

1162
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,320
He's just my greatest cheerleader.

1163
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,959
Being a pole husband can be fun.

1164
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:19,545
At first, pole dancing is very exotic,

1165
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:22,423
and you're like,
"Ooh, look at my wife being all sexy!"

1166
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:24,404
There comes a point when you're like,

1167
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,594
"I just don't wanna watch
any more pole dancing."

1168
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,138
"I've seen all I can see."

1169
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:33,142
Oh, nice! Look at this!

1170
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:38,856
She wanted to put a pole
in my little office in the backyard,

1171
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,610
and I said no
'cause it was gonna block the TV.

1172
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:45,112
But then we both started working out
at the same time.

1173
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,657
I was doing the step on the pole
and against the wall.

1174
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:51,577
He didn't give a flying banana
about the Yankees.

1175
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,745
He was just like…

1176
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,582
We're 28 years in.

1177
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,377
But he's a handful.

1178
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:01,562
We had a roller coaster ride,

1179
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:05,091
and it was rocky for a while.

1180
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,302
If I didn't have
this feminine lifestyle practice,

1181
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:12,014
I would be divorced from who I'm with.

1182
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,685
No,
I don't think we'd be divorced.

1183
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:19,313
What did she say?
"Yes, we would be divorced"?

1184
01:04:20,147 --> 01:04:23,025
Know what? Now I want a divorce.

1185
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,154
I'm totally in love.

1186
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:29,782
This is where I can collapse right here.

1187
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:33,160
He's my everything.

1188
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,244
I'm her pole.

1189
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,000
In more ways than one.

1190
01:04:39,792 --> 01:04:41,252
I do get annoyed sometimes

1191
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:45,256
'cause I'll see husbands and boyfriends

1192
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:46,757
of other pole dancers,

1193
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,509
and they seem very ashamed

1194
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:51,888
that their wives or girlfriends
are pole dancing.

1195
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,473
I just think
those girls should dump those guys.

1196
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,726
'cause you don't need that in your life.

1197
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:59,312
If your boyfriend
or husband doesn't like you pole dancing,

1198
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,521
just get a new one.

1199
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:03,983
There's, like, 3.5 billion of them
in the world.

1200
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:06,569
Maybe four.

1201
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:22,126
The pole
has changed my life in so many ways.

1202
01:05:24,962 --> 01:05:28,966
After I had my child, I gained 60 pounds.

1203
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:32,428
I didn't feel confident in my skin,
didn't fit in any of my clothes.

1204
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,556
I tried everything I could
to lose the weight.

1205
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,308
It wouldn't drop off.

1206
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:38,684
Then I tried pole.

1207
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:43,356
I lost all the 60 pounds.

1208
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,983
It's just such a fun way of working out.

1209
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,613
I understand that people will judge.

1210
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,783
I wish that that perception would change,

1211
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,993
because it's not what people think it is.

1212
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,751
My husband
is extremely conservative.

1213
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:07,171
When I first told him
that I wanted to take pole classes,

1214
01:06:07,254 --> 01:06:08,965
he didn't understand,

1215
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:11,342
and he thought
that it was gonna be a phase,

1216
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,178
that I would find pole
and then give it up.

1217
01:06:14,261 --> 01:06:16,138
And then when you hook,

1218
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,557
you need to push and come out.

1219
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,393
There. Do you see it?

1220
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,353
I love him so much,

1221
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:26,065
but he's extremely possessive
of me and my body.

1222
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:29,485
He doesn't want anybody
to be looking at me.

1223
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:33,572
So, I don't have
a social media platform for what I do.

1224
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,994
I do feel like my husband is taking
something away from me.

1225
01:06:38,077 --> 01:06:40,121
Career-wise, it's limiting me

1226
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:42,844
because instructors will post,
"Here's what I'm teaching in class,"

1227
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,625
but I can't do that.

1228
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:48,504
And I also feel like it's my body,

1229
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:53,175
and if it's my body, then I should be
able to do with it what I want.

1230
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,021
I'm a rare breed

1231
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:08,691
in that there are not a lot
of pole dancers who are also churchgoers.

1232
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:11,902
I do know that I am to be
a submissive wife

1233
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:15,489
from a Christian perspective
and respecting and honoring him.

1234
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:21,620
But if I posted a video of myself
on Instagram, where I was told not to,

1235
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:23,372
he would be mad at me.

1236
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:26,292
Is he gonna stay married to me?

1237
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,044
I have two kids.

1238
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:31,130
I have a family
and I don't want to lose that.

1239
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:39,680
One thing that I had been taught a lot
through my church

1240
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:44,935
is that my worth was
quite dependent on the men around me,

1241
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:49,315
and that I was valuable
if I married a man who is valuable.

1242
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:54,070
Part of the reason I love pole dancing
is because it's subversive.

1243
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:55,446
I feel like I'm saying,

1244
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:59,700
"Take your societal patriarchal standards
and go shove them up your ass."

1245
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:03,370
This is what I love
and this is what makes me feel alive.

1246
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,665
Drop your head back, Megan.

1247
01:08:08,209 --> 01:08:09,585
Yes!

1248
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:10,586
Yes, baby!

1249
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,671
Yeah! What?

1250
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:19,136
I teach women to move into
the fullest integrity of their feminine.

1251
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:22,765
Slow. I want you to get slow.
Round off slow.

1252
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:25,851
Starting with their curves,
their sensuality,

1253
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:27,353
their movement.

1254
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:28,479
Stay right there.

1255
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:32,316
Is it burning? Do you feel it?
Is it pissing you off? Yeah?

1256
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,235
Is it? Stay there.

1257
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:36,403
And when they get
full-voiced in their body,

1258
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:39,990
apparently, that's extraordinarily
distracting to certain people.

1259
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:41,741
The patriarchy.

1260
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:46,413
"Can't control that body.
That's a dangerous body…

1261
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:49,208
unless I can own it, unless it's for me."

1262
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:53,087
The minute my son came out of my belly,

1263
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:56,632
"Be a boy. Be male.
Be strong. Be…."

1264
01:08:56,715 --> 01:09:00,136
"Argh! Live as fully as you can
in your manness, your maleness!"

1265
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:05,349
And we tell our daughters
not to live fully in your body.

1266
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:06,851
It's too dangerous.

1267
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,563
But to truly be equal…

1268
01:09:12,731 --> 01:09:13,983
you better rise,

1269
01:09:14,066 --> 01:09:16,193
and you better get that body back.

1270
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:23,159
Whoo!

1271
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,704
Well,
I came in pretty open-minded.

1272
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:58,819
I had no idea what to expect.

1273
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,946
I had no idea what I was getting into.

1274
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:05,159
We spent two hours, basically,

1275
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:07,453
with women just crying and sobbing.

1276
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:09,705
I just didn't feel empowered.

1277
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:13,375
I felt like I was watching a soap opera.

1278
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,336
We were on that WhatsApp.

1279
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:16,670
There was, like, a group.

1280
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,797
After I saw the pictures,

1281
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:22,134
it was not something
that I would have chosen

1282
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:24,428
to ever be involved in.

1283
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:30,392
I would never want
my 12-year-old son to see me

1284
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:32,519
in my panties with no shirt on.

1285
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:36,273
Sheila writhing around on the ground

1286
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:39,443
and her whole feely "let it out,"

1287
01:10:39,526 --> 01:10:43,614
this wasn't the way
my tribe and I empower each other.

1288
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:45,658
I feel like I'm coming off

1289
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:48,410
like such a huge bitch…

1290
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:51,622
…but I'm just trying to be
as real as possible

1291
01:10:51,705 --> 01:10:54,041
because I think
that there are probably other people

1292
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:55,793
that feel the same way I do.

1293
01:10:57,836 --> 01:10:59,713
I have battles all the time.

1294
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:02,925
There's the external battles

1295
01:11:03,008 --> 01:11:05,594
with the world
not understanding what we do,

1296
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,974
and then there's the internal battles
of the fear.

1297
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:17,606
Everything is cool when I'm here,
and I feel wonderful and fabulous.

1298
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:22,236
And then as soon as I leave it's like,
"Well, it's back to regular stuff."

1299
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,905
I love this class, and I want that.

1300
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,616
I want to grow, feel something different,
feel like I've changed.

1301
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,326
I don't feel like I've changed at all.

1302
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,578
Um, at the party on Friday,

1303
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,539
I was struggling. Everyone was sexy.

1304
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:36,792
Everyone was dancing and free
and just being themselves.

1305
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:38,919
At one point, I went and sat by myself.

1306
01:11:39,003 --> 01:11:41,714
I was like, "I'm not sexy at all."

1307
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,966
I look at my body and I hate my body.

1308
01:11:44,049 --> 01:11:45,884
I don't feel sexy in anything.

1309
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:49,054
It sucked to feel like that.

1310
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:55,144
This is the safest place
in the world for you

1311
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:56,645
because we will protect you

1312
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,148
and allow you to be who you need to be.

1313
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:04,194
To want to always hear
somebody say, "You're beautiful,"

1314
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:08,449
it meant more to hear it from him,
and I didn't get that from him.

1315
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:11,243
The last three months when he was alive,

1316
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,662
we were finally getting
to where we needed to be,

1317
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:15,497
and then he died.

1318
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,501
To want to always hear
somebody say, "You're beautiful…"

1319
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:22,546
I want to hear it
from him, and I didn't.

1320
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:24,173
But I just found it

1321
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:28,677
in a fucking text message
to some other girl.

1322
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:39,146
And I thought to myself,

1323
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:41,231
"How… how could you?"

1324
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:45,361
Your deceased husband
was having an affair?

1325
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:48,822
Maybe a texting affair? Who knows?

1326
01:12:48,906 --> 01:12:50,824
And, you know, I can't ask him.

1327
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:55,704
It's just that one word, "Beautiful."

1328
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,415
And I'm like, "Oh, my God."

1329
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,627
How many times have I wanted to hear it?

1330
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:08,717
Then I thought to myself,
"Maybe it's good I found out

1331
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:11,970
because I was ready
to fucking just fall a-fucking-part."

1332
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:13,555
I was like,

1333
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,226
"Okay, I need to come back
and touch this floor",

1334
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,520
and be in this room…

1335
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:21,647
"so I can live again."

1336
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:27,694
Gonna have to just go on.

1337
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:40,624
It has been six years
since I've had intercourse with a person.

1338
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:44,420
I just felt the need to say it.

1339
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:46,380
I think it's important to say it.

1340
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:49,383
I think it's important in this circle
of naked truthing

1341
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:51,844
to be able to own where you are.

1342
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:52,928
I'll be quite frank.

1343
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:56,306
Your body hasn't wanted to have sex
with another human being yet.

1344
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,475
- That's what I'm...
- I haven't.

1345
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:00,853
There's nothing wrong with that.

1346
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:04,273
Are you gonna be ready for a haircut soon?

1347
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:06,984
I haven't had my hair above my shoulders
in 20 years,

1348
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:09,236
and I have no intention
of putting it there.

1349
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:12,990
Your hair wants to fly and move more.

1350
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:14,992
Okay? So we'll do that.

1351
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:17,453
You're gonna do, like, a makeover thing.

1352
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:22,458
Some people come in
just to learn how to pole dance,

1353
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,668
and their minds are blown open

1354
01:14:24,751 --> 01:14:27,504
that it touches a part of themselves
they didn't know they had.

1355
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:42,686
Take a breath
and breathe here and sit back.

1356
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:47,191
I've needed to fall apart for a long time
and I can't seem to do it.

1357
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:49,610
This is a neurogenic tremor.

1358
01:14:49,693 --> 01:14:52,613
It's just trying to release shit,
and so you're holding on.

1359
01:14:52,696 --> 01:14:54,114
- It's not...
- I'm fighting it.

1360
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:56,908
I know.

1361
01:14:57,534 --> 01:14:59,453
You don't want to just sob?

1362
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:02,581
- No.
- Why?

1363
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:07,419
Because if I fall, I don't know
that I'll put myself back together.

1364
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,505
We've gotta
get this shit out of you.

1365
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:10,923
- Right?
- Yeah.

1366
01:15:11,882 --> 01:15:14,218
Every woman who walks in that door

1367
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:17,054
is coming here to at the very least

1368
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:19,681
get into her sexuality and her body.

1369
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:21,308
So she's signing up for this.

1370
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:24,895
I know she's not asking
for emotional pain,

1371
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:27,439
but she's trying to move beyond that.

1372
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:31,235
And when you are working with her
in a responsible way to do that,

1373
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:33,403
you're giving her a priceless gift.

1374
01:15:36,573 --> 01:15:39,368
It is something that is healing.

1375
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:40,994
It's empowering.

1376
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,164
But I also get that it's something

1377
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:45,541
that can be triggering.

1378
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
So, by teaching,

1379
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:50,837
you're also healing yourself even further.

1380
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:55,175
You gonna knock on that door?

1381
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,680
You and I have talked
about losing the weight.

1382
01:15:59,763 --> 01:16:01,390
How much do you wanna lose?

1383
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:03,809
I would like to lose 100 pounds.

1384
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:05,769
Okay. What are you right now?

1385
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:08,981
- Um… 265?
- Yeah.

1386
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:11,692
- Yeah, 100 pounds would be good.
- Mmm-hmm.

1387
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:14,236
- So let's do that.
- Yeah.

1388
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:15,904
That's scary.

1389
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:20,617
- Um, if 100 pounds is doable...
- Fourteen pounds a month for 100.

1390
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:22,285
Really?

1391
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:24,329
- That's it?
- Yeah.

1392
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:25,581
- Really?
- Yeah!

1393
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:29,585
All I did was calculate
seven months by 100 pounds,

1394
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,670
and it's 14.2 pounds.

1395
01:16:31,753 --> 01:16:33,839
Can we make that our goal?

1396
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:35,632
- Yeah.
- Okay?

1397
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:38,176
Why now? Why this moment?

1398
01:16:38,844 --> 01:16:40,262
I don't wanna die early.

1399
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,932
I wanna live for my children.

1400
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:46,518
- I wanna see them grow up.
- Yeah.

1401
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:50,063
I wanna have
a thriving marriage, a healthy one.

1402
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:51,648
- A hot, sexy one?
- Yeah.

1403
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:53,692
- Where you can get on top?
- Yeah.

1404
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:55,652
Do all kinds of fun stuff
up there.

1405
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,572
- Yes.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1406
01:16:58,655 --> 01:17:01,199
- And it hurts. My body hurts.
- I know. I hear.

1407
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:03,368
- Just now.
- Yeah, now.

1408
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:04,452
Yeah.

1409
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,457
It took you eight years to tell me
what happened to your body.

1410
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:09,540
Mmm-hmm.

1411
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:13,545
That you kind of just went,
"Well, this happened."

1412
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:16,340
Do we wanna come clean
with what happened to your body?

1413
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:18,634
I don't know.

1414
01:17:20,218 --> 01:17:21,762
It's easier to just forget about it.

1415
01:17:21,845 --> 01:17:24,306
No, it's not. It's not "forget about it,"
it's in your body.

1416
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:29,311
Before that incident, were you overweight?

1417
01:17:30,854 --> 01:17:32,314
- No.
- No.

1418
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:34,566
- Mmm.
- Hmm.

1419
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,323
I was taken advantage of

1420
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:47,120
by boys in junior high or high school.

1421
01:18:09,976 --> 01:18:12,092
Will you let those fuckers
destroy your life?

1422
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:14,189
- No!
- No? Mmm-mmm?

1423
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:17,192
- Will you let them steal your body?
- No.

1424
01:18:17,275 --> 01:18:18,275
- Your pleasure?
- No.

1425
01:18:18,318 --> 01:18:20,195
- Okay, so it's time.
- Yeah.

1426
01:18:20,278 --> 01:18:22,406
- It's time.
- It's just the excuse

1427
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:24,700
of them being young and stupid.

1428
01:18:24,783 --> 01:18:26,868
No, it was brutalizing.

1429
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:30,038
Not realizing the impact.

1430
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:32,791
And then having my own daughter,
and just…

1431
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,754
- I don't ever want her to just…
- Oof.

1432
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:38,714
…do what I did and let it be.

1433
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:40,966
You did nothing wrong, okay?

1434
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:43,301
Except exist on the planet
as a female creature

1435
01:18:43,385 --> 01:18:46,012
that was innocent and,
I don't know, 16, 15 years old?

1436
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:47,389
Yeah. Yeah.

1437
01:18:47,472 --> 01:18:51,309
So snap every fucking time you wanna say
something like, "Do what I did."

1438
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:53,812
And you gotta get back into class.

1439
01:18:55,939 --> 01:18:58,483
You gotta move this, okay?

1440
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:07,367
Um, so, I…

1441
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:09,369
When I was 13, I was raped.

1442
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:11,997
Um, and that was…

1443
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,917
that was my first,
like, real sexual experience.

1444
01:19:16,001 --> 01:19:19,671
I was a virgin. I had not had sex.
I was very insecure in my body.

1445
01:19:20,338 --> 01:19:23,967
And I began to feel
more comfortable with myself,

1446
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:26,928
but then I was drugged
and violently raped,

1447
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:29,139
and it really fucked me up.

1448
01:19:29,723 --> 01:19:33,643
And it happened again twice in college,
um, two different times.

1449
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,813
I myself was sexually assaulted
by a partner.

1450
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:40,567
And I ended up comforting
the guy that raped me.

1451
01:19:40,650 --> 01:19:43,195
- Mmm.
- I know. "How does that work," right?

1452
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:46,281
I was 20 years old

1453
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:48,366
the first time that I was raped,

1454
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,952
and my rapist
was my boyfriend at the time.

1455
01:19:52,454 --> 01:19:53,747
I was sexually assaulted

1456
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:57,042
and ostracized and bullied after that

1457
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:58,460
really badly,

1458
01:19:58,543 --> 01:20:00,212
that I had to drop out of school.

1459
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:02,506
For years afterwards,

1460
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:05,091
I carried so much shame in my body

1461
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:08,929
and I felt really uncomfortable
embracing my sexuality after all of that.

1462
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:11,765
I felt like it was part of me trying
to be sexual and confident.

1463
01:20:11,848 --> 01:20:13,934
- And so I blamed myself.
- Yeah.

1464
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:16,019
I feel still really unsafe,

1465
01:20:16,102 --> 01:20:18,146
like, unsafe in society,

1466
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:20,774
unsafe around men, specifically.

1467
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:23,235
My body doesn't feel like my own.

1468
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:26,822
I feel like a blob sometimes.
Like, I just feel so disconnected.

1469
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:29,533
I was constantly living
in a state of fear.

1470
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:33,495
The fear of just any man could hurt me.

1471
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:37,332
Pure terror, and it, um…

1472
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,335
Yeah.

1473
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:58,186
I really want to learn

1474
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:00,021
how to trust myself.

1475
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:04,651
So that's basically why I'm here,
to really have a confidence within myself,

1476
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:08,488
to trust my inner self,
to just be who I know I'm meant to be.

1477
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:16,746
I thought you were after me.

1478
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:20,125
- Well, I think you skipped me.
- Oh… sorry.

1479
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:23,253
I have decided to go public
with what I do.

1480
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:25,839
- Brycee wins!
- Yeah!

1481
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:29,551
My husband found my Instagram account
before I was able to tell him,

1482
01:21:30,468 --> 01:21:31,803
and he immediately said,

1483
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,222
"You did exactly the thing
I told you not to do."

1484
01:21:34,806 --> 01:21:36,349
I said, "You crossed a line,

1485
01:21:36,433 --> 01:21:38,602
telling me what I can and cannot do
with my pole life."

1486
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:43,023
"If I want to post pictures of myself,

1487
01:21:43,106 --> 01:21:44,900
it's my body, it's my right."

1488
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:46,234
"This is what I do."

1489
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,111
"Take it or leave it."

1490
01:21:48,862 --> 01:21:51,156
And he said, "We're done."

1491
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:54,326
"We're getting a divorce."

1492
01:21:56,369 --> 01:21:59,289
I have nothing to be ashamed of.
I have nothing to fear.

1493
01:21:59,831 --> 01:22:01,207
This is who I am.

1494
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:04,252
I've allowed my husband
to control me for a very long time,

1495
01:22:04,836 --> 01:22:07,589
and then I realized that I wasn't free.

1496
01:22:09,215 --> 01:22:11,217
There's people who question me and say,

1497
01:22:11,843 --> 01:22:14,262
"How is what you're doing
bringing glory to God?"

1498
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:17,265
And then I have other people that say,

1499
01:22:17,349 --> 01:22:21,895
"You're 40 years old. You have two kids,
and you're in phenomenal shape."

1500
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:23,647
"You're inspiring."

1501
01:22:31,988 --> 01:22:35,367
There are women
who become so full and so rich

1502
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:38,495
and so explosively radiant.

1503
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:47,379
And the loves that they're with,
the men that they're with,

1504
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:49,965
get so overwhelmed

1505
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:53,051
and don't know how to handle that…

1506
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,513
how to hold space for that,

1507
01:22:56,596 --> 01:22:58,598
how to be even present

1508
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:00,308
for that kind of power.

1509
01:23:02,268 --> 01:23:03,687
Not only are the women gonna grow,

1510
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:06,481
but they're gonna affect everything
and everybody in their path.

1511
01:23:16,908 --> 01:23:19,869
What I'm talking about
is an entire paradigm shift

1512
01:23:19,953 --> 01:23:22,414
of how we live together,

1513
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:24,582
masculine and feminine.

1514
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:30,422
I think you all know that I've
invited some masculine energy here.

1515
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:33,508
I think it would be really,
really helpful for you

1516
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:35,343
to confront a male presence.

1517
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:39,556
These are heightened, conscious men.

1518
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:41,725
They cultivate that ability

1519
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:43,893
to hold the space for the feminine

1520
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:46,479
and whatever comes up emotionally

1521
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:47,689
is what comes up.

1522
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:49,733
Thank you for coming.

1523
01:23:49,816 --> 01:23:52,694
One of the things I love
when I bring masculine presence

1524
01:23:52,777 --> 01:23:55,530
is for you to hold their gaze

1525
01:23:55,613 --> 01:23:58,950
with not just love
but the feeling of "I would kill for you."

1526
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:01,036
Whenever you're ready,

1527
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:02,537
I'm gonna lead you in

1528
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,122
and just find that flow.

1529
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:12,756
Their one goal is
to make you feel loved and seen

1530
01:24:13,423 --> 01:24:14,924
and protected.

1531
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:17,927
Whatever you need.

1532
01:24:18,678 --> 01:24:21,306
They're holding masculine presence.

1533
01:24:22,807 --> 01:24:24,684
These men do exist.

1534
01:24:24,768 --> 01:24:27,479
This masculine energy does exist.

1535
01:24:27,979 --> 01:24:29,939
- Can I touch?
- Ask him.

1536
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:31,566
Is it okay if I touch you?

1537
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:34,235
Everything above the belt.

1538
01:24:39,824 --> 01:24:42,327
This can be incredibly healing

1539
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:43,661
if you choose that.

1540
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:48,750
Feel what it feels like to truly be seen

1541
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:51,836
in all your feminine splendor.

1542
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:59,094
- I just miss him.
- Mmm.

1543
01:25:00,261 --> 01:25:02,263
- I miss him a lot.
- Yeah.

1544
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:09,354
Can you ask him to show you love?

1545
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:26,830
I never got to come out
to my father while he was alive,

1546
01:25:27,413 --> 01:25:30,250
mainly because my mother didn't think
he could accept me.

1547
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:33,920
So I'd like to have
that feeling of acceptance,

1548
01:25:34,003 --> 01:25:36,005
um, by a man who represented him.

1549
01:25:55,316 --> 01:25:58,153
Yeah. You need to feel a man
who can protect you.

1550
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,397
I think of women
that I've been with in my life,

1551
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:38,026
before I was breathing
as consciously as I do now,

1552
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:39,902
that I hurt.

1553
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:44,699
I have tons of regrets
of the way that I would treat women.

1554
01:26:46,075 --> 01:26:48,369
Being with you was that…

1555
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:50,121
for me, that space of, like…

1556
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,749
…being seen in that vulnerable place…

1557
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:56,419
and being held in that space

1558
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:59,464
without the expectation of anything else.

1559
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:04,594
What I wasn't expecting is
how almost all of us became frozen.

1560
01:27:05,261 --> 01:27:06,512
Um, and you're like,

1561
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:09,849
"Wow! Men have
really done a number on us!"

1562
01:27:11,809 --> 01:27:14,270
It just felt like
our hearts touched at one point,

1563
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:16,981
and, like,
I could feel you, and I felt safe.

1564
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:20,777
And when I held my arms back…

1565
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:23,571
…and surrendered that, it was,
like, full surrender.

1566
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:27,033
I don't think I've ever done that
with anyone in my entire life,

1567
01:27:27,116 --> 01:27:28,243
so thank you.

1568
01:27:37,835 --> 01:27:40,046
The next survivor is
Megan Halicek.

1569
01:27:43,383 --> 01:27:46,552
Larry Nassar used to be
an absolute god to me,

1570
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:48,846
but he turned out to be a monster.

1571
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:51,224
He was an unwarranted intruder

1572
01:27:51,307 --> 01:27:55,061
to my most private, intimate,
never-before-touched places.

1573
01:27:56,062 --> 01:27:58,398
My little child self knew
something was wrong,

1574
01:27:58,481 --> 01:28:02,819
but she was petrified to the point
of physical and emotional paralysis.

1575
01:28:02,902 --> 01:28:05,446
As she tried so hard
to keep trusting this man

1576
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:06,656
she thought was her savior,

1577
01:28:06,739 --> 01:28:08,199
the most confusing part was

1578
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:10,702
my mother was
in the room with us while this happens.

1579
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:14,497
When I heard about the abuse,
it was just disbelief.

1580
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:16,207
"How could I let that happen?"

1581
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,461
You have an image
of what safe should be, and you're there,

1582
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:22,880
you're there with her,
and she's still not safe.

1583
01:28:23,589 --> 01:28:25,591
'Cause I thought you were safe.

1584
01:28:27,927 --> 01:28:29,554
Sorry.

1585
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:31,139
It's okay.

1586
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:34,100
I couldn't trust anyone
to keep me safe back then,

1587
01:28:34,183 --> 01:28:36,644
and I can't trust anyone
to keep me safe today.

1588
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,062
The world feels unsafe.

1589
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:39,146
Men feel unsafe.

1590
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:42,859
I'm intensely vigilant
that someone, somewhere,

1591
01:28:42,942 --> 01:28:46,487
is about to take advantage of,
sexualize, or hurt me.

1592
01:28:47,864 --> 01:28:49,240
I will do what it takes

1593
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,367
for as long as it takes to heal

1594
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:53,661
so that this no longer has power over me.

1595
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:58,333
What's the sound?

1596
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:13,598
On Twitter,
there's actually somebody

1597
01:29:13,681 --> 01:29:15,808
who's created a fake profile.

1598
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:19,145
So it's @WendyJamesXXX.

1599
01:29:19,228 --> 01:29:21,147
It's not an account that I created.

1600
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:25,568
He would send people I know
videos of men cumming on my face.

1601
01:29:26,819 --> 01:29:30,114
Here's a pole dance video
that I posted on YouTube.

1602
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:33,242
Of course, some user named "bug man"

1603
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:36,037
needs to call it out like he always does.

1604
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:40,416
"Watch, drain your balls, or squirt,
this woman is very good at her job."

1605
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:44,462
At every turn, even now, 15 years later,

1606
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:47,090
"Did you know she used to be in porn?"

1607
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:49,342
Like it's this terrible thing.

1608
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:53,054
And I don't think it is, but also,
"Why do you care?"

1609
01:29:53,137 --> 01:29:57,016
You know? "Why are you still
bothering me with this?"

1610
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:09,362
The hardest thing
after we go through social ostracization

1611
01:30:09,445 --> 01:30:11,447
is to get up, go back, and say,

1612
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:14,283
"I'm still here. You can't push me down."

1613
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:21,249
Using my story
to help others get over the shame

1614
01:30:21,332 --> 01:30:23,292
that they also feel in their lives

1615
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:25,378
is why I believe I'm here.

1616
01:30:26,295 --> 01:30:27,505
I'm gonna check in.

1617
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:28,798
My name's Amy Bond.

1618
01:30:28,881 --> 01:30:31,217
Hey!

1619
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:34,637
- Oh, my God, you're here! Come!
- How are you?

1620
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:37,223
- Having fun!
- Good! How are you doing?

1621
01:30:37,306 --> 01:30:38,891
- I'm so good.
- Are you having fun?

1622
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:39,976
I'm having so much fun.

1623
01:30:40,059 --> 01:30:42,520
My only goal for tonight is
to make somebody cry.

1624
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:44,814
And not fuck everything up.

1625
01:30:44,897 --> 01:30:47,442
Oh, my God!

1626
01:30:48,401 --> 01:30:49,401
Can I touch it?

1627
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:50,862
- Yes!
- Ahh!

1628
01:30:50,945 --> 01:30:52,989
- How far along are you?
- Seven months.

1629
01:30:53,072 --> 01:30:54,907
- And you wore heels?
- Oh, yeah.

1630
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:56,951
They're church shoes, you know.

1631
01:30:59,954 --> 01:31:02,707
- How's the spin pole?
- It's slow.

1632
01:31:08,337 --> 01:31:10,756
I'm nervous
about all the different ways

1633
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,842
that my routine would go wrong,

1634
01:31:12,925 --> 01:31:16,637
worried about my grip and whether
I would be able to hold on to the pole.

1635
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:19,015
I just don't wanna die.
That's all I ask today.

1636
01:31:19,098 --> 01:31:21,851
Hold on to the pole and I don't fall off.

1637
01:31:21,934 --> 01:31:23,311
That will not happen.

1638
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:37,992
Tomorrow, I am beginning
a weight loss journey.

1639
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:42,872
I am terrified of the safety
of holding on to my weight

1640
01:31:43,414 --> 01:31:46,751
and the fear of what happens
if I let it go.

1641
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:49,962
Over the last 12 years,

1642
01:31:50,046 --> 01:31:52,381
I have been releasing layers.

1643
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:58,012
I truly believe
that the moment my healing started

1644
01:31:58,095 --> 01:32:00,681
was when I actually acknowledged
it was a rape,

1645
01:32:00,765 --> 01:32:03,142
and I didn't make any other excuses.

1646
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:05,561
Hello. How's it going?

1647
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:08,327
- You look very nice.
- Thank you.

1648
01:32:08,397 --> 01:32:10,733
So what is going on exactly today?

1649
01:32:10,816 --> 01:32:11,984
A release.

1650
01:32:12,902 --> 01:32:15,404
I didn't know until seven,
eight years ago

1651
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:19,033
that she had, um, been raped.

1652
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:22,703
I can only imagine
what she went through

1653
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:24,956
and how she stuffed it down

1654
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:26,082
all these years.

1655
01:32:26,582 --> 01:32:29,335
And I know
how important forgiveness is to a person,

1656
01:32:29,418 --> 01:32:31,837
and that was important for me,

1657
01:32:31,921 --> 01:32:36,425
that she truly forgive me for being
ignorant of things that happened,

1658
01:32:36,509 --> 01:32:39,345
for not being there when she needed me,

1659
01:32:39,428 --> 01:32:44,100
for being so busy with work
and taking care of, uh, business

1660
01:32:44,183 --> 01:32:46,477
when I should have been taking care
of my daughter.

1661
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:50,356
She is putting her life out there,

1662
01:32:50,856 --> 01:32:53,234
but if she can find peace in her heart,

1663
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:57,321
if she can become the kind of woman
that she wants to be,

1664
01:32:58,864 --> 01:33:00,575
then I say more power to her.

1665
01:33:05,037 --> 01:33:07,707
I'm releasing any ounce of the rape

1666
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:09,625
that no longer serves my body

1667
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:13,254
and the thoughts of me
not being worthy enough.

1668
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:27,018
The next two weeks is
kind of understanding free dance.

1669
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:29,979
We'll be dancing not from here,

1670
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:33,649
but it's finding pleasure
and finding a story

1671
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:36,527
and the conversation
that your body wants to have.

1672
01:33:40,615 --> 01:33:43,075
I don't know
what wakes you up in the morning,

1673
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:45,119
but Katy Perry's been waking me up
in the morning.

1674
01:33:46,078 --> 01:33:50,166
- I changed all my alarms to erotic songs.
- Yes!

1675
01:33:50,249 --> 01:33:51,626
- Soulful songs.
- Yes!

1676
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:53,419
So in the morning, when I wake up,

1677
01:33:53,502 --> 01:33:56,505
I lay there in bed, and I smile.

1678
01:33:57,089 --> 01:34:00,259
And then I turn just for a second,

1679
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:02,928
and just, like,
"Okay, I wanna start my day."

1680
01:34:03,012 --> 01:34:05,640
Hey, I'm not gonna lie,
I'll hit the snooze again, and, you know…

1681
01:34:07,516 --> 01:34:09,685
Music has come back into my life.

1682
01:34:10,353 --> 01:34:13,648
- And I bought a thong.
- I wanna see the thong!

1683
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:15,524
- Whoo!
- I'm wearing a thong.

1684
01:34:15,608 --> 01:34:18,069
Who fucking does that?
I mean, I'm sure you guys do that.

1685
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:20,321
But I… I'm wearing a thong.

Jaimee! Look at you!

What?

1701
01:34:55,189 --> 01:34:56,732
Can we give her some love?

1702
01:34:56,816 --> 01:34:58,693
All right!

1703
01:34:58,776 --> 01:34:59,860
Look at you.

1704
01:35:00,736 --> 01:35:02,655
More! More!

1705
01:35:02,738 --> 01:35:04,990
That's it. Let your head go.

1706
01:35:06,158 --> 01:35:08,536
The hair coming off
lifted a veil for me.

1707
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:11,497
I've gotten a lot more confident,

1708
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:15,960
experiencing the journey with this group
of women and having their support.

1709
01:35:17,670 --> 01:35:20,047
Exhale down. Good! Good!

1710
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:22,133
Let it go! Let it play!

1711
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:25,136
As it says, it's alive! Whoo!

1712
01:35:25,219 --> 01:35:28,723
What? Who are you?
What's happened to Lisset?

1713
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:33,060
I think the last time I saw you,
you were in a crew neck shirt,

1714
01:35:33,144 --> 01:35:35,855
and I'm like, "What's happened?"
Girl, you were on fire.

1715
01:35:35,938 --> 01:35:38,858
We'd have S women over at the house,
and there'd be a whole pole party.

1716
01:35:38,941 --> 01:35:42,153
And I would sit in the corner and go,
"You guys are so sexy."

1717
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:43,279
But that's…

1718
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:49,160
That's not me.

1719
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:52,663
Drop your right knee into your left knee.

1720
01:35:54,331 --> 01:35:58,169
It's vulnerable for you to let
the feminine curve come out, isn't it?

1721
01:35:58,252 --> 01:36:00,755
You've protected yourself
with the more masculine body,

1722
01:36:00,838 --> 01:36:03,048
but you actually have
a very feminine body.

1723
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:05,050
It is you, isn't it?

1724
01:36:05,134 --> 01:36:07,011
It is.

1725
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:14,977
I'm starting to see
how this spills into everyday life.

1726
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:18,439
Did my lap dance for my husband.

1727
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:25,112
Gazing into each other's eyes
throughout the whole thing

1728
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:27,031
was just so magical.

1729
01:36:27,114 --> 01:36:28,657
Saved our marriage!

1730
01:36:31,827 --> 01:36:34,079
I get really, really excited

1731
01:36:34,163 --> 01:36:37,416
'cause I see change happening.
I see you confronting demons.

1732
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:40,044
I see you fucking turning the fuck on.

1733
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:42,296
And look
how you're just spreading your wings

1734
01:36:42,379 --> 01:36:45,549
in this particular world
that you thought was off-limits to you.

1735
01:37:29,218 --> 01:37:32,763
My dance today is
not about feeling pretty.

1736
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:34,849
It is about feeling powerful.

1737
01:37:36,225 --> 01:37:40,437
I was in an abusive marriage
for nine and a half years.

1738
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:44,149
I was able to
go get a restraining order.

1739
01:37:44,733 --> 01:37:48,404
He was out of the house,
and I was able to finally breathe.

1740
01:37:50,447 --> 01:37:53,993
I just want to let
anyone else know that they're not alone,

1741
01:37:55,452 --> 01:37:57,955
that they're beautiful and they're strong.

1742
01:37:58,455 --> 01:38:02,251
And once you get on the pole and you see
you're doing this for yourself,

1743
01:38:02,334 --> 01:38:05,045
then that can give them
the confidence to realize,

1744
01:38:05,129 --> 01:38:06,672
"I am a strong woman."

1745
01:38:15,514 --> 01:38:17,641
Can I get an Amy Bond?

1746
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:19,602
- Amy Bond?
- Yes.

1747
01:38:40,789 --> 01:38:42,750
Welcome to Amy Bond.

and how to exist in a violated body

1763

after sexual assault.

1764
01:39:31,548 --> 01:39:34,635

feels like a reclamation.

1771
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:54,363

I was so nervous that

01:40:32,735 --> 01:40:34,903
and then you wouldn't be able
to hear the words.

1783
01:40:34,987 --> 01:40:37,114
And it's like they got it.

1784
01:40:37,197 --> 01:40:39,742
I really wish I had nailed my jump,

1785
01:40:39,825 --> 01:40:41,744
'cause I messed it up last year,

1786
01:40:41,827 --> 01:40:44,121
and I messed it up again.
Damn it!

1787
01:40:44,204 --> 01:40:46,874
But, um, I guess I'll just have to do it
in another competition

1788
01:40:46,957 --> 01:40:49,043
because I really wanna nail that move
on a stage

1789
01:40:49,126 --> 01:40:50,919
just like I do in the studio.

1790
01:40:51,003 --> 01:40:53,005
Our silver medal…

1791
01:40:53,505 --> 01:40:56,008
Amy Bond.

1792
01:41:02,431 --> 01:41:03,474
Thank you.

1793
01:41:45,641 --> 01:41:50,521
I'm so grateful for how
it's all happened for me in my life.

1794
01:41:50,604 --> 01:41:52,773
And I can't imagine

1795
01:41:52,856 --> 01:41:55,776
where would I be and what would I be doing
if I hadn't seen.

1796
01:41:56,401 --> 01:41:57,736
Pantera pole dancing.

1797
01:41:58,821 --> 01:42:01,198
A few years ago, I saw Pantera

1798
01:42:01,281 --> 01:42:03,200
at World Competition,

1799
01:42:03,283 --> 01:42:05,035
and I told her, "Thank you."

1800
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:08,413
I was so happy that I was able to see her.
It changed my life.

1801
01:42:11,083 --> 01:42:13,210
Everything that I have,
and everything that I am,

1802
01:42:13,293 --> 01:42:16,296
and everything that I do
is because of that.

1803
01:42:18,173 --> 01:42:20,843
I'm 35, and I feel like

1804
01:42:20,926 --> 01:42:23,053
I'm still not the best pole dancer

1805
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:24,346
that I could be.

1806
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:28,016
I'm still growing. I'm a lifetime student.

1807
01:42:35,816 --> 01:42:38,402
Are you ready to riot?

1808
01:42:50,873 --> 01:42:52,249
Oh, my God!

1809
01:42:52,332 --> 01:42:53,333
Come on!

1810
01:42:56,253 --> 01:42:58,630
Today, I feel hopeful

1811
01:42:58,714 --> 01:43:01,758
I'm going to meet someone again
and fall in love.

1812
01:43:03,844 --> 01:43:05,220
It's gonna be hard.

1813
01:43:05,721 --> 01:43:08,849
I'm afraid…
what if I give my all to someone again,

1814
01:43:08,932 --> 01:43:10,976
and then he just dies on me?

1815
01:43:11,059 --> 01:43:13,353
But I know that's part of life.

1816
01:43:16,732 --> 01:43:18,859
I just gotta learn to embrace it.

1817
01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:23,572
And then if it does
get a little too crazy, I'll just…

1818
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:26,408
…breathe.

1819
01:43:28,744 --> 01:43:29,995
I didn't do that before.

1820
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:12,704
I've been sick for
five years now. I felt the best I've felt.

1821
01:44:12,788 --> 01:44:14,081
I'm doing really well.

1822
01:44:14,873 --> 01:44:16,750
I know this has something to do with it.

1823
01:44:16,833 --> 01:44:18,877
I wanna experience more.

1824
01:44:24,549 --> 01:44:27,261
There's been changes
large and small.

1825
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:29,596
There's been changes sexually.

1826
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,723
Things that we just numb out.

1827
01:44:34,226 --> 01:44:37,145
You feel a side of yourself
you've never felt,

1828
01:44:37,229 --> 01:44:38,981
and it can just conquer the world.

1829
01:44:39,064 --> 01:44:42,359
I have developed real awareness.

1830
01:44:43,068 --> 01:44:45,070
Now, my body's always telling the truth,

1831
01:44:45,153 --> 01:44:46,613
and I need to let that out.

1832
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:49,116
I'm sexy!

1833
01:44:56,331 --> 01:44:59,960
I feel like I've gotten to a place
where I don't have to pretend

1834
01:45:00,043 --> 01:45:03,880
that I didn't do the things
that existed in my past

1835
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:06,300
in order to be accepted by this world.

1836
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:08,885
I think, very subconsciously,

1837
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:12,014
part of the reason it was so important
to me to build this space

1838
01:45:12,097 --> 01:45:15,559
is because I was so fearful
of the world for so long.

1839
01:45:16,810 --> 01:45:19,563
Instead of living in the larger worlds,

1840
01:45:19,646 --> 01:45:22,274
I just decided to create my own.

1841
01:45:22,357 --> 01:45:25,610
The worlds where we all come together
as misfits.

1842
01:45:26,111 --> 01:45:28,947
People who have been ostracized
and sexually shamed,

1843
01:45:29,031 --> 01:45:30,741
and let's dance our hearts out.

1844
01:45:30,824 --> 01:45:33,660
And while those people
are over there judging us,

1845
01:45:33,744 --> 01:45:36,747
because they think
pole dancing is this terrible thing,

1846
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:38,332
we're gonna be over here,

1847
01:45:38,415 --> 01:45:40,876
fucking bouncing our asses on the ground,

1848
01:45:40,959 --> 01:45:43,337
hair-tossing and twerking,

1849
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:45,088
having the time of our lives.

1850
01:45:51,261 --> 01:45:54,348
Are these the same people
we had that opening circle with?

1851
01:45:54,431 --> 01:45:56,308
What? Do you feel it?

1852
01:45:57,309 --> 01:45:59,603
The bravery that it took to come

1853
01:45:59,686 --> 01:46:02,397
and take this journey is beautiful.

1854
01:46:03,565 --> 01:46:07,986
I am overwhelmed with love for you.

1855
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:44,950
Right now
we're seeing this resurgence

1856
01:46:45,023 --> 01:46:46,566
of women supporting women.

1857
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:49,736
Pole dancing has stood for that
for over ten years.

1858
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:53,031
What if we just didn't carry around shame

1859
01:46:53,115 --> 01:46:54,282
about our bodies?

1860
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:56,743
I think the world would be a better place,

1861
01:46:56,827 --> 01:46:58,662
and we'd be able to direct that energy

1862
01:46:58,745 --> 01:47:02,124
into helping each other and doing things
that matter more than that.

1863
01:47:02,624 --> 01:47:05,043
That's the hard work
that needs to be done.

1864
01:47:10,924 --> 01:47:15,095
Every woman has to take a journey
into reclaiming herself…

1865
01:47:17,264 --> 01:47:20,350
and take back what is rightfully hers.

1866
01:47:25,063 --> 01:47:27,816
The biggest obstacle is the male gaze.

1867
01:47:28,984 --> 01:47:30,235
How do you change it?

1868
01:47:31,987 --> 01:47:35,407
It's a battle.
It is a fight for the feminine body.

1869
01:47:40,579 --> 01:47:42,622
This is the only body we're gonna get.

1870
01:47:44,249 --> 01:47:46,042
We're not gonna let them own it.

1871
01:47:46,793 --> 01:47:48,837
We're not gonna be silent anymore.

1872
01:47:49,921 --> 01:47:51,506
That's what I help women do.

1873
01:48:08,356 --> 01:48:10,567
It is my honor and privilege

1874
01:48:11,109 --> 01:48:14,654
to sentence you to 175 years.

1875
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:18,742
I just signed your death warrant.

1876
01:48:18,825 --> 01:48:19,910
All rise.

1877
01:48:34,132 --> 01:48:36,301
- You're, like, melting.
- Isn't it amazing?

1878
01:48:36,384 --> 01:48:37,594
So what are you at now?

1879
01:48:38,094 --> 01:48:40,138
Oh, my gosh. I've lost 35 pounds.

1880
01:48:42,182 --> 01:48:43,517
Get the fuck out!

1881
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:10,627
