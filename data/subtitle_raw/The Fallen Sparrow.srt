1
00:01:59,455 --> 00:02:01,354
<i>Alright. Go on</i>.

2
00:02:02,036 --> 00:02:02,937
<i>Let's have it</i>.

3
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:05,880
<i>Can you go through with it?
Have you got the guts for it?</i>

4
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,483
<i>Or have they knocked it out of you?
Have they made you yellow?</i>

5
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,454
Carry out this bag? Coming right in.

6
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:12,369
Take it.

7
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:13,345
Yes, sir.

8
00:02:25,504 --> 00:02:27,154
I'm sorry.
- That's alright.

9
00:02:38,113 --> 00:02:39,283
The 16th Precinct.

10
00:02:39,854 --> 00:02:41,940
Is that the police Station on 5th?
- Yep.

11
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,698
Where's Tobin?

12
00:02:50,068 --> 00:02:50,683
Who?

13
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,037
Inspector Tobin. Toby.

14
00:02:52,497 --> 00:02:54,014
His office is down on 7th Street.

15
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:56,491
Don't give me that.
He's been here since he was a rookie.

16
00:02:56,862 --> 00:02:59,062
Where is he?
- You're so smart, you find him.

17
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:06,788
Keep an eye on these.
I don't want them hooked.

18
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:15,887
You call me.

19
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,732
You're Inspector Tobin, huh?
- Uhuh.

20
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,355
Head of Homicide?
- Yep.

21
00:03:20,775 --> 00:03:22,622
Why did you state Louis'
death was accidental?

22
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,109
Louis? You mean Louis Lepetino?
- Yeah.

23
00:03:25,462 --> 00:03:26,392
Because it was.

24
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:27,823
A lot of malarkey.

25
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:30,338
Who are you, mister?
- John McKittrick.

26
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:32,241
Now I got you.

27
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:35,139
You're old Chris's boy.
Glad to see you. Sit down.

28
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:37,089
I, uh ..

29
00:03:38,245 --> 00:03:40,521
Used to work for your father
in the old East Side days.

30
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:42,913
Too bad he left the force.
He might still be with us.

31
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:46,050
I've an opinion that getting into
big money don't do anyone any good.

32
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:47,520
Your opinion.

33
00:03:47,738 --> 00:03:50,348
Let's stop cutting up the apple cake.
I'm here to find out about Louis.

34
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:52,566
A friend of yours?
- Since we were kids.

35
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:54,277
You know that.

36
00:03:54,942 --> 00:03:57,394
Where you been hiding out?
- Yeah, you weren't at the church.

37
00:03:57,748 --> 00:03:59,068
Louis had a swell funeral.

38
00:04:01,672 --> 00:04:03,658
I've been on a ranch in
Arizona, taking a rest.

39
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,684
From Spain?

40
00:04:06,228 --> 00:04:07,282
I heard about that.

41
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,660
I didn't know about Louis until
I read it in a newspaper.

42
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:11,490
I caught the next train.
- Uhuh.

43
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:14,007
You know Louis didn't kill himself.

44
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:16,128
I didn't say that.
I said it was an accident.

45
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:18,370
The toughest cop on the
force falls from a window?

46
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:19,991
Don't give me that. I knew him.

47
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,280
Maybe you're playing Dude on an
Arizona ranch you've got out of touch.

48
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,569
Or maybe you didn't know Louis got mixed
up with a crowd. Your kind of crowd.

49
00:04:26,787 --> 00:04:29,497
Park Avenue and a couple of refugee
princes. What do you think of that?

50
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:31,300
I don't like this.

51
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:34,225
I don't like any of it.
You know Louis didn't fall out a window.

52
00:04:34,617 --> 00:04:35,988
What's the angle?
- No angle.

53
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:38,939
Or maybe you think you know more
than the whole of Homicide Squad.

54
00:04:39,273 --> 00:04:41,128
Maybe you got psychic
on that Dude ranch?

55
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:42,444
Listen.

56
00:04:42,827 --> 00:04:45,820
Arizona may let you guys play
cowboys as long as you pay for it.

57
00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:50,118
But I'm hanged if New York will let you
play detective if you're Mr McKittrick.

58
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:53,085
So run along and forget it. You'll have
more fun uptown where you belong.

59
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,473
Alright, sweetheart.

60
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:57,186
Let's leave it straight.

61
00:04:57,503 --> 00:04:59,495
I'll find what happened
and why you're covering.

62
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:00,672
Run along, son.

63
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,580
And don't get a headache.

64
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:04,623
Oh.

65
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:07,896
Louis got me a permit to carry a gun.

66
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:09,922
His 'accident' doesn't shelve that?

67
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,135
Good for a year.

68
00:05:11,717 --> 00:05:13,205
Why did you want to carry a gun?

69
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:15,869
To shoot people with, sweetheart.

70
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:27,934
Mama. Mama Lepetino.

71
00:05:28,418 --> 00:05:31,031
Kit. It is Kit. Papa, it is Kit.

72
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:32,887
Kit.

73
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:36,257
We knew you would come, Kit.

74
00:05:37,357 --> 00:05:38,666
Always, big boy.

75
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:40,457
When he was a boy ..

76
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,889
When he was in trouble, you would come.

77
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,378
Now.

78
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,253
We're alone and I want you.

79
00:05:47,705 --> 00:05:50,293
My boy, Louis. My boy.

80
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:52,299
Can you find out, Kit?

81
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:54,704
Yeah, I'll find out.
I know it wasn't an accident.

82
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:55,567
No.

83
00:05:55,785 --> 00:05:57,848
You got any ideas, Papa?
- No.

84
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:01,125
We not see Louis for a
long time before he die.

85
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:03,953
He goes around with these people.
- What people?

86
00:06:04,394 --> 00:06:06,009
These very <i>swell</i> people.

87
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:09,009
Inspector Tobin says it was an accident.
- Yes.

88
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,873
Why did he say that?
- I don't know.

89
00:06:12,091 --> 00:06:13,482
He was a good boy.

90
00:06:14,388 --> 00:06:15,475
A great guy.

91
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,598
Will you stay for supper, Kit?
- No I can't, I've got to run but ..

92
00:06:19,056 --> 00:06:21,747
I'll come down in a couple of days
and we'll have a real visit, huh?

93
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:22,887
Arrivederci.

94
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:25,426
You'll find out, Kit?
- You bet I'll find out.

95
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,127
We'll see you again.

96
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:29,156
Good luck, Kit.

97
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:40,751
Hello Ab.
- Kit.

98
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:43,953
Come in. What you doing back?
This is really good news.

99
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:45,841
I thought I'd had enough.

100
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:47,896
Mind if I bunk with you a few days?

101
00:06:48,114 --> 00:06:50,968
Try going anywhere else. The man
will unpack you when he gets back.

102
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:54,654
You have the place to yourself though.
I've got to go to Washington tonight.

103
00:06:54,977 --> 00:06:57,394
Come on in, I want to get a good
look at you. How are you, anyway?

104
00:06:57,612 --> 00:06:59,740
I'm okay .. I'm fine.

105
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,543
You look it. I guess the
ranch was the right answer.

106
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:04,769
I guess so.
- Great to have you back, Kit.

107
00:07:04,987 --> 00:07:06,404
Thanks Ab.
- And you're okay?

108
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:07,906
Yeah.
- Sure?

109
00:07:08,473 --> 00:07:11,013
Yeah .. I never felt better in my life.

110
00:07:11,404 --> 00:07:14,032
Scars all healed. Weigh what
I should. Eat well, sleep well.

111
00:07:16,074 --> 00:07:18,290
Steady as a rock.
- No more noises?

112
00:07:19,646 --> 00:07:21,064
No.
- Swell.

113
00:07:21,386 --> 00:07:23,289
This calls for a celebration.
How about a drink?

114
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:24,432
Sure, thanks.

115
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:27,173
What are you doing all dressed up?
- Going to the Tavitons.

116
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:30,317
Barby is giving a party for some
refugees. That's her latest craze.

117
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,822
Why not come along, Kit?
You won't have to dress.

118
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,991
I don't mind.

119
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:36,225
Wasn't Barby the reason you
rushed back to New York?

120
00:07:36,594 --> 00:07:37,971
No, not exactly.

121
00:07:39,272 --> 00:07:40,825
Was it because of Louis Lepetino?

122
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:43,629
What do you know about it, Ab?

123
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:45,730
Nothing much. I wasn't
there when it happened.

124
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:47,928
One of Barby's parties.

125
00:07:48,257 --> 00:07:50,132
Louis falls from the top-floor window.

126
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:51,987
That's the way they tell it.
- Who?

127
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,261
All of them.
You'll meet most of them tonight.

128
00:07:55,794 --> 00:07:58,139
Louis got you out of Spain .. didn't he?

129
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,141
How do you know that?
- A guess.

130
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:02,621
Can you talk about it now?

131
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:04,425
I .. I tell you I'm okay.

132
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,885
I know you are, Kit.
Will you tell me about it?

133
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:08,683
I'd like to know. I've got a reason.

134
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,006
What is this, a test?
- You know better than that.

135
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:13,348
What do you want to know?

136
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:15,472
How it was in Spain when
they held you prisoner.

137
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,649
When you came back before
you wouldn't talk of it.

138
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:19,065
Yeah, but I can now.

139
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,416
It was pretty tough.

140
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,090
First, you didn't think
you could take it.

141
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,263
Then you did.

142
00:08:27,609 --> 00:08:30,214
It was if somebody stuffed you
in a bottle and put the cork in.

143
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:33,170
Dark .. hot ..

144
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:35,703
You live mostly by sounds.

145
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,862
You knew it was morning
when you heard the birds.

146
00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:42,413
You knew it was Sunday
when the bells rang.

147
00:08:43,239 --> 00:08:45,518
In the dark there, you got to
know everything by the sounds.

148
00:08:46,107 --> 00:08:47,691
Like the padding in the corridor.

149
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:49,218
That would be the ..

150
00:08:49,503 --> 00:08:51,669
The footsteps of .. a peasant.

151
00:08:52,308 --> 00:08:54,889
Or the .. boots of a Nazi guard.

152
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,476
Sometimes the .. screams ..

153
00:08:58,207 --> 00:08:59,919
Of some of the other prisoners.

154
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:02,974
A key turning in a lock
with a squeaky hinge.

155
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:05,629
Water dripping in the hall.
I remember that, on the left.

156
00:09:05,937 --> 00:09:07,098
That was bad because ..

157
00:09:07,406 --> 00:09:08,919
We didn't get much to drink.

158
00:09:10,035 --> 00:09:12,146
We got pretty good on the
sounds and they helped.

159
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,732
Except when you knew it was
long enough between times.

160
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:18,711
Then you'd just wait for the boots
to come and the drag of that foot.

161
00:09:19,817 --> 00:09:22,896
When that came, you knew they'd
come in and take you upstairs and ..

162
00:09:23,644 --> 00:09:26,495
Beat you up and do their little tricks.

163
00:09:28,227 --> 00:09:30,293
Maybe it was only a little
while between times.

164
00:09:31,586 --> 00:09:33,180
You hear the drag of that foot.

165
00:09:34,015 --> 00:09:35,951
You'd try to hide
against the wall and ..

166
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:38,748
Crawl into a hole, only there
wasn't a hole to crawl in.

167
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,220
Try to hide in a corner and ..

168
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:44,174
You feel like a dog that's
been whipped and cut.

169
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,799
You tell them it's been too soon.

170
00:09:48,318 --> 00:09:49,931
Those filthy rats. It was too soon.

171
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,645
They knew it was too soon.
I couldn't stand any more.

172
00:09:53,947 --> 00:09:56,041
They didn't want me to die.
They <i>couldn't</i> let me die.

173
00:09:56,288 --> 00:09:58,158
I couldn't take it anymore.
I have to tell ..

174
00:09:58,376 --> 00:09:59,763
Take it easy, Kit.

175
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:05,769
Well.

176
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:09,255
That's the way it was.
Over and over again.

177
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:13,798
You hear the sound
of a limp in the hall.

178
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:16,280
I never saw him. The one that limped.

179
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,308
The others would come
down and take me upstairs.

180
00:10:20,057 --> 00:10:21,382
And go to work on me.

181
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:24,550
Between times, they
thought of new ideas.

182
00:10:25,502 --> 00:10:27,087
The sadistic swine.

183
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:30,385
Then they'd throw me
back in the cell and ..

184
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:32,783
Go on, all over again.

185
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:35,455
Well, how am I doing?

186
00:10:35,831 --> 00:10:38,111
I'm sorry Kit, I didn't mean
to bring it back to you.

187
00:10:38,477 --> 00:10:39,510
That's alright.

188
00:10:39,849 --> 00:10:41,622
I've licked it. I can talk about it.

189
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:43,706
Louis got you out of all that.

190
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:46,001
Yeah .. Louis Lepetino.

191
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,261
Is that my room?
- Yeah.

192
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:50,777
I'll clean up now.

193
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:56,980
Good evening, Mr Parker.
- Hello Robert.

194
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,520
Good evening, Mr McKittrick.
- Hello, Robert.

195
00:11:01,898 --> 00:11:04,080
Sounds like a binge.
- Exactly, sir.

196
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:07,877
Here is Miss Taviton.
- Kit.

197
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:09,099
Hello, Barby.

198
00:11:09,591 --> 00:11:10,454
Darling.

199
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,854
Kit, you look wonderful.
- Thanks. So do you.

200
00:11:14,326 --> 00:11:15,746
This is marvelous.

201
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:21,348
Well, why all the reserve?

202
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:23,507
So many people. I'll see you later.

203
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,622
Hello, Ab.

204
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:27,222
Ever since Ab called
I've been in a whirl.

205
00:11:27,651 --> 00:11:29,518
Come on in.
There's people I want you to meet.

206
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,502
They were just talking about you.

207
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,288
Coming, Ab?
- In a moment.

208
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:37,509
Kit. Good heavens, look at the man.

209
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:51,922
Doctor Skaas, may I
present John McKittrick.

210
00:11:52,582 --> 00:11:53,919
How do you do.

211
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,439
And this is Otto Skaas.

212
00:11:55,824 --> 00:11:56,725
Mr McKittrick.

213
00:11:57,821 --> 00:12:00,092
Miss Taviton told us that
you fought in Spain.

214
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:03,244
I was there for a while.
- I'm very interested, Mr McKittrick.

215
00:12:03,945 --> 00:12:06,393
You see, at present I'm engaged
in a work having to do with ..

216
00:12:06,723 --> 00:12:09,003
The cruelties of men towards other men.

217
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:11,486
Your opinion would be invaluable.

218
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:14,958
Could an old invalid impose
on you to visit him someday?

219
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,835
Glad to be of service.

220
00:12:17,187 --> 00:12:18,823
I was just frightening these people.

221
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,579
I was comparing
modern scientific torture.

222
00:12:23,527 --> 00:12:25,292
With the methods of the ancients.

223
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,518
Shall I continue?
- Go ahead.

224
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:30,465
Thank you.

225
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:33,509
Would someone please close that door?

226
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:40,608
I was saying ..

227
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:43,476
That the ancients were far too violent.

228
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,947
They concerned themselves ..

229
00:12:46,397 --> 00:12:48,491
With a purely physical torture.

230
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:50,356
Primitive ideas.

231
00:12:51,122 --> 00:12:54,145
Because release by death,
comes too quickly.

232
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,525
The ancient Asiatics
on the other hand ..

233
00:12:58,169 --> 00:12:59,883
Displayed far greater cunning.

234
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:02,258
For now is conceived the idea ..

235
00:13:02,602 --> 00:13:04,431
Of combining mental torture.

236
00:13:05,057 --> 00:13:06,658
With the purely physical.

237
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:09,869
For instance, the old practice ..

238
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,690
Of dripping water.

239
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:15,647
Drop by drop.
On the forehead of the victim.

240
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:20,574
Drop by drop .. for hour after hour.

241
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,827
Day after day.

242
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,773
Until the weight of each drop.

243
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,242
The shock of it.

244
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:29,811
Mounts and becomes unbearable.

245
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:32,547
Then.

246
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:35,765
Here is the principle
of all modern torture.

247
00:13:36,736 --> 00:13:37,847
Release is given.

248
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,694
The dripping is stopped.

249
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,587
The victim revived.

250
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:44,249
Just at the borderline of sanity.

251
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:46,545
Then.

252
00:13:47,817 --> 00:13:49,494
Then comes an interval.

253
00:13:50,437 --> 00:13:53,160
In which the victim tortures himself.

254
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,606
Waiting.

255
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,109
Knowing the operation will be repeated.

256
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,672
And it is repeated most assuredly.

257
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:05,268
With perhaps several new variations.

258
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:08,124
You see the point?

259
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,821
How perfectly ghastly.

260
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:11,850
You see the beauty of the idea?

261
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:14,603
Mental torture.

262
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:18,411
In which the victim
actively collaborates.

263
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,471
I could tell you many, many
more ingenious methods.

264
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,698
Barby, come on. We'd better get started.

265
00:14:26,044 --> 00:14:27,649
It's after nine now.
- Alright.

266
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:29,261
We really should be going.

267
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,583
Come on, Kit.
We're off to the refugee dinner.

268
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:33,648
Don't bother about dressing.

269
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:36,325
A great bunch, what?

270
00:14:37,213 --> 00:14:39,937
Who are the Skaas's?
- Refugee friends of Barby's.

271
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,019
The doctor is a famous
Norwegian historian.

272
00:14:42,394 --> 00:14:44,552
He escaped from Norway
just before the Nazis got in.

273
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,547
Who's the blond wolf?
- Otto?

274
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:50,028
He's too interested in Barby.
Maybe you'd better smack him down.

275
00:14:50,246 --> 00:14:51,553
Who is he?
- The nephew.

276
00:14:51,935 --> 00:14:53,865
They're both friends of
Prince François de Namur.

277
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,094
They live in the same house.
The Prince is great with the refugees.

278
00:14:58,075 --> 00:15:01,075
The old Skaas seems to be okay.
He's been pretty well identified.

279
00:15:02,056 --> 00:15:03,166
What about Otto?

280
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:05,887
He's taken on his uncle's word.
He got out by underground.

281
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:08,374
Automatically, that puts
him on the prescribed list.

282
00:15:08,592 --> 00:15:09,787
You believe all that?

283
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:12,385
Do you mind if I don't?
- No. Not at all.

284
00:15:13,387 --> 00:15:15,884
Were the Skaas's at the party
when Louis had his 'accident'?

285
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:16,836
Yeah.

286
00:15:17,054 --> 00:15:18,670
Kit, talk to Whitney about the Skaas's.

287
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,632
Whitney?
- The 'Imp'. My cousin.

288
00:15:20,944 --> 00:15:23,018
She's here tonight, talk to her.
She was at the party.

[ Singing ]

290
00:16:00,842 --> 00:16:02,446
She's improved, hasn't she?
- Who?

291
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:05,815
Whitney. That's Whitney Parker.
- Oh, that's 'The Imp'.

292
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:08,909
She's a big girl now.
She sings professionally at Club 50.

293
00:16:09,415 --> 00:16:12,507
Society stuff.
- Not so much. She's on her own.

294
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:15,013
Her father wouldn't have it.
Threw her out.

295

[ Singing ]

296
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:55,684
I don't like to watch people dance.

297
00:16:56,492 --> 00:16:58,500
Take me back to my table please.
- Yes, sir.

298
00:17:05,965 --> 00:17:07,935
Who's that girl?
- The one with Otto?

299
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:08,904
Yeah.

300
00:17:09,277 --> 00:17:10,604
The prince's granddaughter.

301
00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:13,904
Prince Françoise?
- Yes. How did you know?

302
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:15,892
I get around.

303
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:22,618
You've got a roving eye, Kit.
That's something new.

304
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:27,109
What's the matter, Kit?
- How?

305
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,580
You seem almost indifferent.

306
00:17:31,768 --> 00:17:33,554
When I kissed you tonight, I thought ..

307
00:17:35,831 --> 00:17:37,353
I don't know.
- You're spoiled.

308
00:17:38,471 --> 00:17:39,646
What is it, Kit?

309
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,197
Maybe I haven't big ideas any more.

310
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:43,965
Maybe I'm just a mug.

311
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,866
Don't get tough with me, darling.

312
00:17:46,257 --> 00:17:49,037
When I came back from Spain and
you came to see me in the hospital.

313
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,478
I thought I got the brush-off then.

314
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:54,536
You looked so awful.
- Yeah.

315
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,929
I know.

316
00:18:05,146 --> 00:18:08,366
Kit, Otto and I are going to
Franconia Lodge for some skiing.

317
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:10,901
Why don't you come along?
- No thanks.

318
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,212
Kit, please.

319
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:15,546
I can't, I have to stay in town.
But I'll see you when you get back.

320
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:20,481
Don't sit on me, you'll mess my dress.

321
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,675
I was going to suggest you
go home and put one on.

322
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:27,194
It's nice to have you back, Kit.
You're looking fine.

323
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:29,628
And you. Your hair done
and braces off your teeth ..

324
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:31,191
You almost look grown up.

325
00:18:31,461 --> 00:18:33,524
Stop it. Didn't Ab tell you about me?

326
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:34,402
No.

A dog of a cousin he turned out to be.

328

Why don't we go someplace
and have a real drink?

329
00:18:41,725 --> 00:18:43,881
I'll go, Kit. But I have to be
at the club by midnight.

330
00:18:44,294 --> 00:18:45,825
Come on over there.
- Ab?

331
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,419
I can't, Kit. I've got to leave
for Washington in an hour.

He's a working man now.

Come on, The Imp. Let's go.
- Kit.

334

Take it easy until you hear from me.
- Sure.

We're going now. Goodnight.

Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

Is this alright?
- Fine, thank you.

338

They won't serve you a drink, Imp.

339
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,094
They will but I don't want one.

340

I'll have some brandy. Bring the bottle.
- Yes, sir.

Are you going to howl?
- No.

There is a solution. Ask Ab.

00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,133
What's Ab doing in Washington?
- Working for the government. Decoding.

344

But he's on his own.
About the Skaas's, I mean.

Who is Otto Skaas?
- He could be an agent.

346
00:19:38,242 --> 00:19:40,323
How about Doctor Skaas?
- He could be another one.

347
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,935
What makes you think so?
- I'm smart.

348
00:19:43,421 --> 00:19:44,962
I can smell phonies.

349
00:19:51,092 --> 00:19:54,030
What do you know about Louis Lepetino?
- That's why you came back, isn't it?

350
00:19:54,619 --> 00:19:56,036
They're waiting for you.
- Who?

351
00:19:56,254 --> 00:19:57,179
The Lepetinos.

352
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,296
I work for Jake, Louis' brother.
He runs this place.

353
00:20:01,662 --> 00:20:03,711
You were there that night
at Barby's, weren't you?

354
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:05,422
Yes.
- What happened to Louis?

355
00:20:05,806 --> 00:20:08,274
I don't know, Kit.
Only Toni Donne saw him fall.

356
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,731
Who's Toni Donne?

357
00:20:10,124 --> 00:20:12,195
The girl you were ogling at the ball.

358
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:15,046
The dark-haired one.

359
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:16,313
Uhuh.

360
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:18,530
The Prince de Namur's granddaughter.

361
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:22,375
Alright, stop making me guess.
Now you put it together.

362
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:25,300
It was .. one of Barby's big parties.

363
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:28,517
Everyone was packed in the playroom
upstairs to hear Anton and me.

364
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,856
Doing that song you heard tonight.

365
00:20:31,634 --> 00:20:33,968
Both the Skaas's were there.
They were staying at Barby's then.

366
00:20:34,377 --> 00:20:36,751
Barby, of course. Louis, and Toni Donne.

367
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:38,211
Yeah, go on.

368
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:42,162
I was just finishing the last chorus
where I start to build to the climax ..

369
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:44,382
When suddenly she screamed.
- Toni Donne?

370
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,209
Yes. She said she felt faint. She'd gone
across the hall to the library in front.

371
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:52,547
She said she was across the room and
saw Louis fall or jump from the window.

372
00:20:53,153 --> 00:20:54,500
Where were the Skaas's?

373
00:20:54,897 --> 00:20:57,234
Doctor Skaas was sitting next to me.
- How about Otto?

374
00:20:57,909 --> 00:20:59,453
Otto was upstairs in his room.

375
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:02,006
A waiter spilled wine on his
shirt and he'd gone to change.

376
00:21:03,484 --> 00:21:04,615
A perfect alibi.

377
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:06,876
Alibis have to be perfect, don't they?

378
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,087
And the prince?

379
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:11,263
He wasn't there.

380
00:21:11,721 --> 00:21:13,331
He is too feeble to go out.

381
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:15,958
How do you know so much
about these people, Imp?

382
00:21:16,646 --> 00:21:18,482
Anton. My accompanist.

383
00:21:24,895 --> 00:21:26,541
Where does Anton fit?

384
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:28,619
He's alright.

385
00:21:30,196 --> 00:21:33,311
Look, he's just a lunk-head musician.
He knows the prince and Toni. That's it.

386
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,526
Let him alone and stick to Toni Donne.

387
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,907
I've got to go change.
Will I see you after the show?

388
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,541
No. But I'll call you.

389
00:21:44,448 --> 00:21:45,980
Goodnight.
- Night.

390
00:21:48,981 --> 00:21:49,776
Waiter.

391
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:54,154
Tell Jake I want to see him, will you.
- Yes, sir.

392
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:02,260
Hello, McKittrick.
- Hello, Jake.

393
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:05,475
We thought you didn't care, Kit.
You took so long to come.

394
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:08,928
I didn't hear about it for a month.
I was over to see Mama this afternoon.

395
00:22:13,261 --> 00:22:14,971
Your health is regained?
- Yeah.

396
00:22:15,898 --> 00:22:17,043
Who got Louis?

397
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:18,702
If I knew ..

398
00:22:20,691 --> 00:22:22,639
It was no grudge. It was no hood.

399
00:22:23,063 --> 00:22:24,122
I found that out.

400
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,958
Louis liked women, Jake.
Beautiful women.

401
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:33,069
He wouldn't jump out of a window and
wouldn't let a guy get him in a spot.

402
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,159
Someone pushed him.
And it had to be a dame.

403
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,680
A beautiful dame.
- Yeah.

404
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:41,469
How did he get mixed
up in a society mob?

405
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:42,905
I don't know.

406
00:22:44,775 --> 00:22:46,600
Does Toni Donne come around here?

407
00:22:47,804 --> 00:22:49,316
I know so few by name, Kit.

408
00:22:50,304 --> 00:22:51,856
Barby Taviton comes here.

409
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:54,987
That makes two dames.

410
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:57,254
Toni Donne and Barby.

411
00:23:02,227 --> 00:23:04,562
Where'd you get that pianist?
- Whitney brought him in.

412
00:23:05,303 --> 00:23:06,351
What about him?

413
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,555
A musician.

414
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:09,657
He's kind-of funny.
- How do you mean?

415
00:23:09,893 --> 00:23:11,473
He hangs around with a funny crowd.

- Mr McKittrick?

Yeah.
- Yes, sir.

00:23:41,905 --> 00:23:44,602
You're new here, aren't you?
- I'm substituting for Henry, sir.

I'm Roman. Come this way, please.

422

I've unpacked for you, sir.
Except for the small case.

You have them here, don't you?

Yes, of course.

- Yes.

I only knew him for a short time.
- That didn't matter.

692
00:43:57,053 --> 00:43:58,498
Louis always fell in love easily.

693
00:43:58,953 --> 00:44:00,946
With you, he'd be in
love before he started.

694
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,881
He like beautiful things.

695
00:44:03,966 --> 00:44:05,193
He was kind to me.

696
00:44:07,143 --> 00:44:08,470
He was kind to you?

697
00:44:09,067 --> 00:44:11,568
So you pushed him out of a window.
- No, no. That's not true.

698
00:44:13,165 --> 00:44:14,638
I think you'd better take me home.

699
00:44:19,394 --> 00:44:21,100
Toni .. let's dance.

700
00:44:21,997 --> 00:44:23,995
No, please.
- You can't make a scene.

701
00:44:24,444 --> 00:44:27,443
Think of the prince.
Think of those hundreds of generations.

702
00:44:50,048 --> 00:44:52,896
Don't you know the beautiful adventuress
never fights when she's kissed?

703
00:45:00,311 --> 00:45:01,585
I don't understand you.

704
00:45:01,803 --> 00:45:03,758
You can be a gentleman or a ..
- Or a mug.

705
00:45:04,606 --> 00:45:05,792
I was raised that way.

706
00:45:07,068 --> 00:45:09,724
I was a mug until I was fourteen.
Then they made me a gentleman.

707
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:12,345
Then some of the boys
made me a mug again.

708
00:45:14,787 --> 00:45:16,515
Why are you doing this to me, Kit?

709
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:19,142
I don't know.

710
00:45:20,464 --> 00:45:22,075
Maybe because I'm fighting too.

711
00:45:22,922 --> 00:45:25,512
I meant it when I said it would
be easy to fall in love with you.

712
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,356
I came out with you tonight
because I wanted to.

713
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,234
Because in the shop, even
through your insolence I felt ..

714
00:45:32,568 --> 00:45:34,241
I know.
- You didn't let me finish.

715
00:45:34,553 --> 00:45:35,708
You didn't have to.

716
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,894
Where did you get Louis' wallet?

717
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,184
He gave it to me.

718
00:45:40,634 --> 00:45:42,422
It wasn't that night.
It was the day before.

719
00:45:42,953 --> 00:45:45,676
He showed me a picture of the
two of you when you were boys.

720
00:45:46,253 --> 00:45:47,497
He forgot it when he left.

721
00:45:48,111 --> 00:45:50,014
That's a honey.
- You can believe it or not.

722
00:45:50,544 --> 00:45:52,590
You dropped it in my pocket
on the train, didn't you?

723
00:45:53,476 --> 00:45:54,456
Yes.
- Why?

724
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,167
To warn you.

725
00:45:56,591 --> 00:45:58,005
I didn't want any more trouble.

726
00:45:59,499 --> 00:46:01,622
I liked you because of what
Louis said about you.

727
00:46:02,072 --> 00:46:03,645
How'd you know I'd be on that train?

728
00:46:04,703 --> 00:46:07,529
Don't you know you've been watched
ever since you set foot in New York?

729
00:46:08,361 --> 00:46:11,372
I've seen many pictures of you.
Pictures you don't know exist.

730
00:46:12,341 --> 00:46:15,029
I had access to information that
told me what train you'd be on.

731
00:46:16,587 --> 00:46:18,513
I could be killed for
what I've just said.

732
00:46:21,203 --> 00:46:22,719
I told you everything I know.

733
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:25,406
Or everything I can.

734
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,205
Believe me.

735
00:46:28,311 --> 00:46:29,272
I'd like to.

736
00:46:32,072 --> 00:46:32,973
Let's drop it.

737
00:46:33,503 --> 00:46:35,661
Let's have some fun.
I can use a big slice of the stuff.

738
00:46:35,984 --> 00:46:36,847
So could I.

739
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:38,716
Come on. Let's see the town.

740
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,956
We're not good for each other, Kit.
- Aren't we?

741
00:46:57,821 --> 00:46:59,395
No. There are many reasons, but ..

742
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,473
I'd like you to believe in me.

743
00:47:02,229 --> 00:47:04,217
It's possible we may be
of help to each other.

744
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,778
Goodnight.

745
00:47:07,733 --> 00:47:08,819
Goodnight.

746
00:47:17,921 --> 00:47:20,053
Alright Danny. To the apartment.
- Okay.

747
00:47:56,255 --> 00:47:57,020
Come on.

748
00:47:58,404 --> 00:47:59,051
Talk.

749
00:47:59,523 --> 00:48:00,825
I'm sorry. You surprised me.

750
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:03,251
I surprised <i>you?</i> That's swell.

751
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:06,353
I was searching your apartment.
- Don't give me that.

752
00:48:06,571 --> 00:48:07,434
It is true.

753
00:48:08,027 --> 00:48:08,743
Now.

754
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:11,065
Let's have it.

755
00:48:11,593 --> 00:48:14,233
It's no good you hitting me.
I'll only tell you what I please.

756
00:48:15,238 --> 00:48:16,397
Come on, let's have it.

757
00:48:17,651 --> 00:48:19,139
You're the one who should know.

758
00:48:19,751 --> 00:48:21,581
That a man cannot be <i>made</i> to talk.

759
00:48:26,581 --> 00:48:28,124
It would mean my death.

760
00:48:28,981 --> 00:48:30,443
As it would have meant yours.

761
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,039
You know, no matter what happened.

762
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,705
If you talked, you would be killed.

763
00:48:38,097 --> 00:48:39,100
Is it not so?

764
00:48:41,374 --> 00:48:43,021
That's why they allowed you to escape.

765
00:48:43,958 --> 00:48:45,143
Allowed me to ..?

766
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:47,767
Yes.

767
00:48:48,701 --> 00:48:49,685
It was so.

768
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:53,489
They permitted you to send the letter.

769
00:48:54,343 --> 00:48:56,708
They <i>allowed</i> you to steal the Luger.

770
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,808
You were watched as you crawled through
the swamps and slept in dung-heaps.

771
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,177
Every minute, you were watched.

772
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:08,828
So they let me go, huh?

773
00:49:10,901 --> 00:49:12,356
I should have thought of that.

774
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:14,970
They didn't beat it out of me
and they couldn't kill me.

775
00:49:15,353 --> 00:49:16,283
So they'd wait.

776
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:18,353
Is that it?

777
00:49:19,116 --> 00:49:19,990
Alright.

778
00:49:21,319 --> 00:49:23,922
They don't have the Standard.
I do, and I'll keep it. Tell them that.

779
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,899
You can tell the little
man in Berlin that.

780
00:49:26,377 --> 00:49:27,635
You can tell them this.

781
00:49:28,281 --> 00:49:29,535
They watched, maybe.

782
00:49:30,796 --> 00:49:32,008
But they slipped up.

783
00:49:32,781 --> 00:49:35,565
Because they didn't see my ..
- Then it isn't in this country?

784
00:49:39,542 --> 00:49:40,533
Get out of here.

785
00:49:45,842 --> 00:49:46,721
Out.

786
00:49:58,628 --> 00:49:59,860
Come on. Come on, you.

787
00:50:01,385 --> 00:50:02,114
Alright.

788
00:50:04,985 --> 00:50:06,327
Get out and stay out.

789
00:50:33,678 --> 00:50:35,676
<i>That's not the way. Drinking won't help</i>.

790
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,972
<i>It's you yourself who's got to do it</i>.

791
00:50:38,588 --> 00:50:41,096
<i>You almost flunked it tonight.
Like you flunked it at Whitney's</i>.

792
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:43,444
<i>You have to fight it out yourself.
Face it</i>.

793
00:50:44,016 --> 00:50:45,260
<i>Find the man and kill him</i>.

794
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:47,324
<i>You've got to do it quickly</i>.

795
00:51:24,085 --> 00:51:25,314
[ Gunshot! ]

796
00:52:43,256 --> 00:52:43,972
<i>Hello?</i>

797
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:45,110
Whitney? Kit.

798
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,416
I want you to come right
over here. Ab's apartment.

799
00:52:56,964 --> 00:52:58,626
What is it, Kit?
- Come in.

800
00:53:03,034 --> 00:53:05,130
Listen, Imp. Can you stand a shock?

801
00:53:07,908 --> 00:53:08,921
What is it?

802
00:53:09,266 --> 00:53:11,217
Ab is dead. He was shot. Here.

803
00:53:11,558 --> 00:53:13,145
A few minutes before I phoned you.

804
00:53:14,141 --> 00:53:14,757
No.

805
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,611
Where is he?

806
00:53:22,477 --> 00:53:23,406
Come on.

807
00:53:34,806 --> 00:53:36,153
Ab .. Ab.

808
00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:38,641
Don't touch anything.

809
00:53:42,035 --> 00:53:43,068
How, Kit?

810
00:53:44,235 --> 00:53:45,445
How?
- I don't know.

811
00:53:46,274 --> 00:53:47,776
I found him just as he is.

812
00:53:50,168 --> 00:53:52,298
Kit .. you didn't do it?

813
00:53:53,801 --> 00:53:55,131
Whitney. Stop it.

814
00:53:56,142 --> 00:53:57,429
You know better than that.

815
00:54:00,149 --> 00:54:02,929
But he didn't do it himself.
He couldn't.

816
00:54:03,384 --> 00:54:04,907
No. We both know that.

817
00:54:05,878 --> 00:54:07,542
Whoever did it made one mistake.

818
00:54:09,243 --> 00:54:10,142
Come on.

819
00:54:23,204 --> 00:54:24,872
Why did he go to Washington?

820
00:54:25,603 --> 00:54:26,843
I don't know.

821
00:54:27,654 --> 00:54:29,142
He was working for the government.

822
00:54:30,094 --> 00:54:31,394
That's all he told me.

823
00:54:34,219 --> 00:54:35,737
Could it have been because of you?

824
00:54:37,924 --> 00:54:38,886
Maybe.

825
00:54:39,745 --> 00:54:41,041
Give me five minutes.

826
00:54:41,451 --> 00:54:44,081
Call Tobin. Inspector Tobin.
16th Precinct Headquarters.

827
00:54:44,501 --> 00:54:47,632
Tell him what happened. I'll be back in
an hour. Tell him it all. Understand?

828
00:54:49,301 --> 00:54:51,105
You afraid?
- Uhuh.

829
00:54:54,586 --> 00:54:55,619
Good kid.

830
00:54:57,935 --> 00:54:59,417
Lock the doors after me.

831
00:55:00,872 --> 00:55:02,553
I'll leave the hall door unlatched.

832
00:55:03,912 --> 00:55:05,835
Hello, Mama? Mama Lepetino?

833
00:55:07,129 --> 00:55:08,259
This is Kit.

834
00:55:09,411 --> 00:55:12,309
Yeah, Mama. Did Louis ever show you
any souvenirs I sent him from Spain?

835
00:55:12,689 --> 00:55:14,601
<i>Souvenirs, Kit? Like some seashells?</i>

836
00:55:14,953 --> 00:55:16,498
Yeah. That's right. You got them?

837
00:55:16,716 --> 00:55:17,994
<i>Yes, Kit. I have them</i>.

838
00:55:18,316 --> 00:55:19,732
That's fine. I'll be right down.

839
00:55:21,636 --> 00:55:24,202
I was to keep them and say nothing
about them until you asked.

840
00:55:24,591 --> 00:55:25,905
Louis put them here.

841
00:55:28,983 --> 00:55:29,956
That's it.

842
00:55:30,174 --> 00:55:32,233
You can throw the rest out, Mama.
I don't want them.

843
00:55:32,451 --> 00:55:33,360
Kit.
- Yeah?

844
00:55:33,578 --> 00:55:34,861
You know who killed Louis?

845
00:55:35,267 --> 00:55:37,478
I .. I think so. I'll find him.

846
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:43,770
I'm McKittrick.

847
00:55:47,506 --> 00:55:50,137
Where is Tobin?
- In the kitchen. Quizzing the butler.

848
00:55:50,606 --> 00:55:52,356
He's back, is he?
- Yeah, he's back.

849
00:55:52,691 --> 00:55:54,278
Tell Tobin I want to see him.
- Yeah.

850
00:55:54,496 --> 00:55:55,629
Are you kidding?

851
00:55:59,963 --> 00:56:01,383
Are you alright, Imp?
- Yes.

852
00:56:02,272 --> 00:56:03,571
I told them everything.

853
00:56:04,766 --> 00:56:07,007
I'm sorry the way I broke it.
I had a reason.

854
00:56:07,225 --> 00:56:08,791
Hello McKittrick.
- Hello.

855
00:56:09,148 --> 00:56:10,616
No-one here but you?
- Right.

856
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:11,569
Tell me.

857
00:56:11,917 --> 00:56:14,543
It was about 6 o'clock. I heard a shot.
I got my own gun and went out.

858
00:56:14,895 --> 00:56:16,230
That door was locked.
- Why?

859
00:56:16,726 --> 00:56:18,447
I locked it. Any objections?
- No.

860
00:56:18,827 --> 00:56:19,913
Let me see your gun.

861
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,122
Got any ideas?
- Yeah.

862
00:56:25,584 --> 00:56:28,934
I have something somebody else wants.
Some guy is after me. I don't know who.

863
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:32,065
That's why it sounds phony.
All I know is that he limps.

864
00:56:32,747 --> 00:56:34,671
What's this got to do
with Parker's suicide?

865
00:56:35,028 --> 00:56:37,418
It wasn't a suicide.
- You start that again?

866
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,311
Didn't you tell them?
- I did.

867
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:42,533
As a kid, his brother played with
a gun and it went off in his face.

868
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:45,397
After that, just looking at a gun
gave Parker the willies. I heard.

869
00:56:45,763 --> 00:56:47,806
He couldn't possibly handle a gun.
I know that.

870
00:56:48,267 --> 00:56:49,369
Funny you claim that.

871
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,913
It puts your own pants
right on the hot seat.

872
00:56:52,343 --> 00:56:53,510
Ab didn't kill himself.

873
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,563
The Parkers are an important family.

874
00:56:55,781 --> 00:56:58,981
I wouldn't take a chance on calling
a murder a suicide unless I was sure.

875
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:01,924
Then the Lepetinos aren't so important.
Is that it?

876
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:04,703
You think this is tied up with Louis?
- Of course I do.

877
00:57:05,144 --> 00:57:08,401
Ab suspected a man named Otto Skaas
who was at the party when Louis got it.

878
00:57:09,122 --> 00:57:10,891
I think Ab was doing some investigating.

879
00:57:11,251 --> 00:57:13,755
Otto Skaas was at Franconia
Lodge earlier this month.

880
00:57:15,126 --> 00:57:18,260
This lame guy you're talking about.
Why is he after you?

881
00:57:19,355 --> 00:57:21,758
He's after something I have.
A Battle Standard.

882
00:57:22,137 --> 00:57:22,841
A what?

883
00:57:23,201 --> 00:57:24,938
A Battle Standard. A pennant. A flag.

884
00:57:26,093 --> 00:57:28,068
Where did you get this .. flag?

885
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:30,042
In Spain. It belonged to my brigade.

886
00:57:30,528 --> 00:57:32,061
For crying out loud.

887
00:57:32,455 --> 00:57:34,444
You expect me to believe
you let a guy gun for you.

888
00:57:34,864 --> 00:57:37,811
You let your friends be bumped off one
after another for a dopey pennant?

889
00:57:38,728 --> 00:57:40,176
Let him alone.
- Take it easy.

890
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:41,863
Take it easy. It's alright.

891
00:57:45,672 --> 00:57:47,221
You wouldn't know, Tobin.

892
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:49,913
Sure, it's a dopey flag.

893
00:57:51,181 --> 00:57:54,588
You could buy one like it for ten bucks.
But you couldn't buy this one.

894
00:57:54,983 --> 00:57:57,022
I've got it, I've kept it and
I'm going to keep it.

895
00:57:57,723 --> 00:57:58,446
Well.

896
00:57:59,547 --> 00:58:04,741
Do you think Parker was bumped off as he
knew something of this pennant of yours?

897
00:58:05,147 --> 00:58:06,955
He never heard of it.
- For the love of ..

898
00:58:07,173 --> 00:58:09,146
So why was he wiped out
by this gang of yours?

899
00:58:09,516 --> 00:58:12,089
Because he was after the Skaas's.
Because Louis was after them.

900
00:58:12,748 --> 00:58:15,372
But he got bumped off.
- Nobody bumped off Louis.

901
00:58:15,851 --> 00:58:17,925
Don't you think the department
takes care of its own?

902
00:58:18,143 --> 00:58:18,911
Not well.

903
00:58:19,269 --> 00:58:19,970
Listen.

904
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:23,375
We checked on the Skaas's. So has
Washington and the refugee committee.

905
00:58:23,793 --> 00:58:25,963
They are okay.
- Anton, the piano player?

906
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,289
He was here last night and
saw me when I came in.

907
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:29,530
No, Kit.

908
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:31,094
Yeah?

909
00:58:31,312 --> 00:58:32,813
I threw him out early this morning.

910
00:58:33,064 --> 00:58:34,681
You threw out the butler.
- I had to.

911
00:58:34,899 --> 00:58:35,963
Not what he says.

912
00:58:36,315 --> 00:58:38,162
He says he heard you yell.
Looked in the room.

913
00:58:38,439 --> 00:58:41,166
You were alone, yelling at nobody.
Then you threw him out.

914
00:58:42,554 --> 00:58:44,344
You think I'm nuts. Is that it?

915
00:58:45,399 --> 00:58:46,105
Look.

916
00:58:46,595 --> 00:58:49,172
Louis told me you were in bad shape
when you came back from Spain.

917
00:58:49,515 --> 00:58:50,874
Maybe you're not yourself yet.

918
00:58:51,275 --> 00:58:54,726
Just forget about flags and people who
aren't here and people being murdered.

919
00:58:56,538 --> 00:58:57,994
Who are you covering, Tobin?

920
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,749
If you think they're after you
I'll assign a man to you.

921
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:01,994
No thanks.

922
00:59:02,212 --> 00:59:04,972
He'd probably fall out of a window or
shoot himself with a gun he didn't have.

923
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:08,704
Okay, sweetheart.
You work your way and I'll work mine.

924
00:59:09,207 --> 00:59:11,260
But if I commit suicide
you'll know it's a phony.

925
00:59:11,792 --> 00:59:13,782
Even if you watch me
write the farewell note.

926
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:17,357
If you go around yelling Parker was
murdered, you'll be in the hot seat.

927
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:22,783
Fatheaded, stupid ..

928
00:59:32,508 --> 00:59:33,694
What is that, Kit?

929
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,484
I've seen that design before.
- On the prince's cups.

930
00:59:36,987 --> 00:59:39,105
That's why they're on
exhibition for me to see.

931
00:59:41,205 --> 00:59:42,589
Is this from the Standard?

932
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:44,664
Yeah.

933
00:59:45,394 --> 00:59:46,495
You don't believe me?

934
00:59:46,818 --> 00:59:49,394
Yes, Kit. Of course I do.
- No. Or else you're covering too.

935
00:59:49,777 --> 00:59:52,424
Why does everyone dummy up on me?
What's the angle? They think I'm nuts?

936
00:59:52,642 --> 00:59:53,557
Kit, please.

937
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:55,514
You believe Anton was here last night?

938
00:59:55,838 --> 00:59:58,502
But he can't have killed Ab. He was
at my apartment at three this morning.

939
00:59:59,032 --> 01:00:01,586
He seemed frightened. I made him coffee.
We talked until you phoned.

940
01:00:02,818 --> 01:00:04,143
You're a great bunch.

941
01:00:04,613 --> 01:00:06,146
You and Barby and Toni.

942
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,521
You're a walking string of alibis.

943
01:00:09,091 --> 01:00:10,934
Anton can't have shot Ab.
He was with you.

944
01:00:11,273 --> 01:00:13,699
He can't have killed Louis.
He was playing your accompaniment.

945
01:00:13,917 --> 01:00:16,399
Otto couldn't have shot Ab.
He was at Franconia with Barby.

946
01:00:16,791 --> 01:00:20,017
He wasn't in the room when Louis died.
Dr Skaas can't have killed Louis as ..

947
01:00:20,438 --> 01:00:23,624
He was sat in a wheelchair next to you.
And the prince never leaves his nest.

948
01:00:24,613 --> 01:00:28,569
And when Ab was shot we'll find Toni was
sitting in Skaas's lap playing checkers.

949
01:00:31,676 --> 01:00:34,225
Maybe the boys did commit suicide.
- No, Kit.

950
01:00:36,367 --> 01:00:37,207
Listen.

951
01:00:38,919 --> 01:00:39,976
Get on the phone.

952
01:00:40,339 --> 01:00:43,432
Call Barby at Franconia. Have her
meet me at 8 o'clock in Jake's office.

953
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:45,368
Tell her to bring Otto.

954
01:00:45,835 --> 01:00:47,929
You come along too. Get Toni to come.

955
01:00:48,589 --> 01:00:49,893
Tell them it's important.

956
01:00:51,472 --> 01:00:52,623
Don't mention this.

957
01:00:52,924 --> 01:00:54,826
It's going to lead me
to the man who limps.

958
01:01:03,344 --> 01:01:06,387
Kit. Miss Taviton and young
Skaas are in the office.

959
01:01:14,423 --> 01:01:15,231
Greetings.

960
01:01:15,449 --> 01:01:17,477
This is ghastly about Ab.
It can't have happened.

961
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:19,765
It seems real to me. Hello Skaas.

962
01:01:20,101 --> 01:01:21,804
I'm terribly sorry, Mr McKittrick.

963
01:01:22,022 --> 01:01:23,244
Ab couldn't kill himself.

964
01:01:23,462 --> 01:01:24,391
You think that?

965
01:01:24,707 --> 01:01:26,466
We know how he felt about guns.
- We do.

966
01:01:26,842 --> 01:01:28,984
Otto thinks he may have been
killed by foreign agents.

967
01:01:29,364 --> 01:01:30,894
A bright boy, Otto.

968
01:01:31,284 --> 01:01:34,058
What can we do, Kit?
Can we find out what he was working on?

969
01:01:34,533 --> 01:01:37,433
If you went through his papers we
could at least find a starting point.

970
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:38,678
Otto can help.

971
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:41,450
I have some understanding
of ciphers, Mr McKittrick.

972
01:01:41,802 --> 01:01:44,079
If there should be any
among Mr Parker's papers.

973
01:01:44,439 --> 01:01:46,712
This gives me a chance to be
of service to my own country.

974
01:01:47,191 --> 01:01:49,279
A lot of your people made
their own opportunities.

975
01:01:49,713 --> 01:01:52,656
Yes. This is true, but my
uncle is a helpless cripple.

976
01:01:53,336 --> 01:01:54,946
I do not feel I can leave him.

977
01:01:55,269 --> 01:01:57,547
I'm grateful for this chance
to do some little thing.

978
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:00,013
Kit, where is everybody?
Is Whitney coming?

979
01:02:00,745 --> 01:02:01,976
She should be here now.

980
01:02:02,345 --> 01:02:04,536
Otto, see if you can find her.
- Certainly.

981
01:02:12,412 --> 01:02:14,896
Come on, beautiful. Let's dance.
- Kit.

982
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:19,794
Sure. We'll dance on Ab's coffin.
Why not? Ab liked people to have fun.

983
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,424
You've been drinking too much.
- You're a hypocrite.

984
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:25,009
You like anything that's
wrong and you know it.

985
01:02:25,623 --> 01:02:27,267
You're a pagan and always have been.

986
01:02:27,615 --> 01:02:29,943
Don't talk like that.
- There's only one way to talk to you.

987
01:02:38,156 --> 01:02:41,651
I have to tell you, Kit.
Ab and I were engaged.

988
01:02:42,073 --> 01:02:42,880
Wonderful.

989
01:02:43,523 --> 01:02:45,827
After you came back he
didn't want to hold me to it.

990
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:48,603
But I had to pretend.

991
01:02:49,149 --> 01:02:51,214
I couldn't hurt him again.
- And Otto?

992
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:53,433
You were so indifferent.

993
01:02:56,615 --> 01:02:58,346
You should have been
in Spain, sweetheart.

994
01:02:58,661 --> 01:03:00,473
Why?
- Anything for a thrill.

995
01:03:01,182 --> 01:03:02,627
Is that why you went?
- Why not?

996
01:03:04,377 --> 01:03:05,774
We're sort-of alike.

997
01:03:09,163 --> 01:03:09,950
Greetings.

998
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:11,765
Hello, Toni.

999
01:03:12,403 --> 01:03:12,989
We.

1000
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,066
We've been waiting for you.

1001
01:03:15,657 --> 01:03:17,016
In a manner of speaking.

1002
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:18,720
Hello, Barby.
- Hello, dear.

1003
01:03:19,012 --> 01:03:20,557
Hello, Whitney.
- Hello.

1004
01:03:21,574 --> 01:03:22,733
Let's all have a drink.

1005
01:03:23,081 --> 01:03:24,411
No thank you. I'd rather not.

1006
01:03:25,147 --> 01:03:26,753
Why did you ask us to come here, Kit?

1007
01:03:27,903 --> 01:03:29,087
You heard about Ab?

1008
01:03:29,846 --> 01:03:31,243
Yes, I'm terribly sorry.

1009
01:03:31,593 --> 01:03:33,807
He shot himself with
a gun he didn't have.

1010
01:03:34,354 --> 01:03:36,669
At least that's what the police say.
Bright boys, aren't they.

1011
01:03:37,174 --> 01:03:39,648
Otto here, had a different idea.
He thought they might be Nazis.

1012
01:03:40,068 --> 01:03:41,142
Me, I don't know.

1013
01:03:41,645 --> 01:03:44,005
I had a hunch and thought I may
be able to tell you something.

1014
01:03:44,463 --> 01:03:46,036
But it didn't work. I'm sorry.

1015
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,178
Then there's nothing you want us for?

1016
01:03:48,396 --> 01:03:49,648
I guess not, except ..

1017
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,915
The most beautiful thing I own
to the most beautiful girl.

1018
01:04:04,245 --> 01:04:05,481
Where did you get that?

1019
01:04:06,543 --> 01:04:07,910
I picked it up in Spain.

1020
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:11,151
It's sort-of a medallion
that hung on a Standard.

1021
01:04:11,517 --> 01:04:12,590
Beautiful, isn't it?

1022
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:14,448
Like Toni.

1023
01:04:14,986 --> 01:04:17,402
They go together.
I thought of that today.

1024
01:04:17,739 --> 01:04:18,697
So I had it set.

1025
01:04:19,258 --> 01:04:20,616
Will you wear it for me, Toni?

1026
01:04:20,834 --> 01:04:22,657
I'm sorry. I can't accept this.

1027
01:04:23,056 --> 01:04:24,382
You've got to, Toni.
- No.

1028
01:04:24,602 --> 01:04:26,004
You mustn't refuse it, Toni.

1029
01:04:27,028 --> 01:04:28,976
The prince would not
object to your accepting it.

1030
01:04:30,912 --> 01:04:32,174
Wear it for me, Toni.

1031
01:04:34,591 --> 01:04:35,378

First it was something a kid would do.

1198
01:13:07,237 --> 01:13:09,909
A kid who had ideas and ideals.

1199
01:13:10,598 --> 01:13:12,372
Hold out on the dirty sadists.

1200
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:17,058
Then it meant my life holding out
because if I gave in they'd kill me.

1201
01:13:17,833 --> 01:13:19,725
Then it began to mean something more.

1202
01:13:20,289 --> 01:13:21,548
Can you understand that?

1203
01:13:21,892 --> 01:13:24,182
Some things you have to do.
It don't matter what you think.

1204
01:13:24,577 --> 01:13:26,554
Nor how afraid you are.
You just <i>have</i> to do it.

1205
01:13:27,023 --> 01:13:30,248
What else makes a man stand up against
a tank with only a rifle in his hand?

1206
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:34,046
Why do they hide out in the
hills after their army has gone?

1207
01:13:34,617 --> 01:13:35,949
Keep plugging away.

1208
01:13:36,421 --> 01:13:38,269
When they know as sure
as God's in heaven.

1209
01:13:38,677 --> 01:13:41,077
That their people will be
knocked out in retaliation.

1210
01:13:41,713 --> 01:13:43,136
Do you suppose they think?

1211
01:13:43,731 --> 01:13:46,000
I don't think so. They know.

1212
01:13:46,734 --> 01:13:49,438
Deep down inside they
know they have to do it.

1213
01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:52,320
It's something they can't help.
That's the way it is with me.

1214
01:13:53,117 --> 01:13:54,853
I know I have to hold out.

1215
01:13:55,805 --> 01:13:57,386
Maybe because the thing is a symbol.

1216
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:00,998
A symbol of 3,000 men
who were my friends.

1217
01:14:01,813 --> 01:14:03,370
3,000 guys who were ..

1218
01:14:03,984 --> 01:14:05,455
Shot down around me.

1219
01:14:06,264 --> 01:14:07,955
Maybe it's something more than that.

1220
01:14:08,459 --> 01:14:11,184
Maybe it's everything that people
all over the world are fighting for.

1221
01:14:12,476 --> 01:14:13,664
I don't know.

1222
01:14:14,362 --> 01:14:17,516
I just know before I let that little man
put his filthy hands on that Standard ..

1223
01:14:17,856 --> 01:14:18,969
I will burn in hell.

1224
01:14:20,112 --> 01:14:21,265
I'm sorry, Kit.

1225
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:23,455
You don't think I can win?

1226
01:14:23,673 --> 01:14:24,856
I know you can't.

1227
01:14:25,386 --> 01:14:26,899
They've got you. Is that it, Toni?

1228
01:14:27,293 --> 01:14:29,536
Or they've broken you. Don't let them.

1229
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:32,548
You belong with me. Come with me.
- I can't, Kit.

1230
01:14:34,017 --> 01:14:35,834
I know what you're fighting for.

1231
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:39,547
I've loved peace all my life.

1232
01:14:41,191 --> 01:14:42,741
I love life's little things.

1233
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:45,415
Things that were important to me.

1234
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:47,702
The house we had in the village.

1235
01:14:48,685 --> 01:14:49,831
The old dog.

1236
01:14:51,590 --> 01:14:53,429
I loved watching the children grow up.

1237
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:57,810
I've lost all of that now.

1238
01:15:01,405 --> 01:15:02,706
I love you too, Kit.

1239
01:15:03,236 --> 01:15:03,880
Toni.

1240
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:05,303
Toni.
- No.

1241
01:15:05,719 --> 01:15:08,022
Listen to me. You must make a
choice now before it's too late.

1242
01:15:08,243 --> 01:15:09,925
I can't choose now.
- You must.

1243
01:15:15,702 --> 01:15:17,298
Will you come to the house tonight?

1244
01:15:17,861 --> 01:15:19,098
There will be a crowd.

1245
01:15:19,522 --> 01:15:21,600
It's a party for the doctor.
- You choose that?

1246
01:15:23,616 --> 01:15:24,447
Yes.

1247
01:15:26,671 --> 01:15:28,706
Will you arrange .. to get me out ..

1248
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:31,552
So I can have a look
at Dr Skaas's rooms?

1249
01:15:32,283 --> 01:15:34,300
I don't expect to find anything
more than Louis did.

1250
01:15:35,079 --> 01:15:37,054
I know the man that
limps will come along.

1251
01:15:38,368 --> 01:15:39,500
When I meet him ..

1252
01:15:40,173 --> 01:15:41,303
I'm going to kill him.

1253
01:15:41,717 --> 01:15:42,932
You can tell him that.

1254
01:15:43,150 --> 01:15:44,362
I don't know him, Kit.

1255
01:15:45,696 --> 01:15:46,811
He'll come, alright.

1256
01:15:48,106 --> 01:15:49,172
Suppose he doesn't?

1257
01:15:49,554 --> 01:15:50,856
Then I'll burn the Standard.

1258
01:15:52,071 --> 01:15:53,517
They won't get the ashes either.

1259
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,607
I'll throw them out over the bay.

1260
01:15:58,402 --> 01:15:59,358
Alright, Kit.

1261
01:16:13,893 --> 01:16:15,305
Okay, Danny?
- Okay, pal.

1262
01:16:15,906 --> 01:16:18,155
We got both Otto and
our ex-butler at Jake's.

1263
01:16:18,512 --> 01:16:20,152
On ice. They won't bother you.

1264
01:16:20,517 --> 01:16:22,503
Nice going. Riverside Drive.
- Hop in.

1265
01:16:48,693 --> 01:16:50,590
Hello darling.
- Hello Kit.

1266
01:16:51,029 --> 01:16:52,098
You're lovely.

1267
01:16:52,797 --> 01:16:54,489
I will do as you ask.
- Good.

1268
01:16:55,327 --> 01:16:58,017
My grandfather isn't here. They took
him to hospital this afternoon.

1269
01:16:58,502 --> 01:17:00,479
Serious?
- No. He just needs rest.

1270
01:17:02,086 --> 01:17:03,123
Come in.

1271
01:17:14,754 --> 01:17:15,702
Excuse me.

1272
01:17:37,192 --> 01:17:38,989
Kit, you can't stay here.
- Why not?

1273
01:17:40,383 --> 01:17:42,050
Nothing I know. Something you <i>feel</i>.

1274
01:17:42,268 --> 01:17:44,469
Something that's here that's
wicked and vicious and awful.

1275
01:17:45,472 --> 01:17:48,517
I don't know. But I feel it's so real.
Like a blanket smothering me.

1276
01:17:48,953 --> 01:17:50,811
Go to Jake's.
I'll meet you in a few minutes.

1277
01:17:51,137 --> 01:17:52,480
You promise me?
- Sure.

1278
01:17:55,012 --> 01:17:57,141
Mr McKittrick, you're
not thinking of leaving?

1279
01:17:58,489 --> 01:17:59,761
No, not at all.

1280
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,644
Too bad the prince isn't here.

1281
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:03,794
I shall have to play host.

1282
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:06,232
I'll make a sorry host I think.

1283
01:18:07,115 --> 01:18:08,817
But perhaps we'll have our talk.

1284
01:18:09,481 --> 01:18:11,797
A long talk. If you would be so kind.

1285
01:18:12,486 --> 01:18:13,509
About tortures?

1286
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,186
How we shall get along.

1287
01:18:16,977 --> 01:18:19,247
Come .. let's have something to drink.

1288
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:20,714
Toni.

1289
01:18:24,323 --> 01:18:25,988
In your honour, my dear friend.

1290
01:18:26,572 --> 01:18:29,258
The prince was very flattered
that you admired his goblets.

1291
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:31,992
Now, a toast.

1292
01:18:33,151 --> 01:18:35,431
Just an old Borgia custom, doctor.

1293
01:18:37,118 --> 01:18:37,931
Oh yes.

1294
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:39,569
Your joke.

1295
01:18:40,806 --> 01:18:42,018
And now a toast.

1296
01:18:43,337 --> 01:18:44,311
To us.

1297
01:18:44,889 --> 01:18:46,131
Success in the New World.

1298
01:18:52,245 --> 01:18:53,699
The old Borgia custom.

1299
01:18:55,026 --> 01:18:57,273
We talked this afternoon.
The prince and I.

1300
01:18:58,231 --> 01:18:59,662
About poisons and drugs.

1301
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:03,482
He had just been given an
injection of Scoloradine.

1302
01:19:04,630 --> 01:19:07,049
You are familiar with its
properties, Mr McKittrick?

1303
01:19:07,408 --> 01:19:08,454
I believe not.

1304
01:19:09,023 --> 01:19:11,798
The ancients.
They knew some remarkable drugs.

1305
01:19:12,377 --> 01:19:14,309
But it has remained for modern science.

1306
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:16,672
To produce Scoloradine.

1307
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,149
Which kills 'will'.

1308
01:19:19,367 --> 01:19:20,070
'Will'?

1309
01:19:20,444 --> 01:19:21,328
Yes, 'Will'.

1310
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:24,451
The will to resistance in any form.

1311
01:19:25,299 --> 01:19:27,261
Particularly where speech is concerned.

1312
01:19:29,048 --> 01:19:30,830
That's why your American papers.

1313
01:19:31,389 --> 01:19:33,266
Have called it a truth serum.

1314
01:19:35,788 --> 01:19:37,196
But I'm boring you, I'm afraid.

1315
01:19:37,515 --> 01:19:38,264
Hardly.

1316
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:40,285
We must see the dance.

1317
01:19:40,845 --> 01:19:43,183
Do you like gypsy music, Mr McKittrick?
- Very much.

1318
01:19:43,996 --> 01:19:44,924
Toni. Please.

1319
01:20:34,338 --> 01:20:36,167
Up these stairs.
The first door on the left.

1320
01:20:36,487 --> 01:20:37,734
You'll find it unlocked.

1321
01:20:38,383 --> 01:20:39,555
Please hurry.

1322
01:21:28,194 --> 01:21:29,737
[ Foot-dragging sounds ]

1323
01:21:45,148 --> 01:21:46,783
[ Foot-dragging sounds ]

1324
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:29,092
Why do you not shoot, Mr McKittrick?

1325
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:30,304
You have a gun.

1326
01:22:30,747 --> 01:22:31,483
Yes.

1327
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,341
Why do you not shoot?

1328
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:36,750
I will tell you .. Mr McKittrick.

1329
01:22:37,509 --> 01:22:38,891
It will please you to know.

1330
01:22:39,874 --> 01:22:41,010
Because you cannot.

1331
01:22:41,815 --> 01:22:43,023
You haven't the courage.

1332
01:22:43,945 --> 01:22:45,123
You sent me a message:

1333
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:46,992
'When I meet him, I shall kill him'.

1334
01:22:47,549 --> 01:22:49,575
Very brave .. very brutal.

1335
01:22:51,401 --> 01:22:53,716
But it's not possible for you
to carry out your threat.

1336
01:22:54,156 --> 01:22:55,561
Is it, Mr McKittrick?

1337
01:22:56,452 --> 01:22:57,038
No.

1338
01:22:58,239 --> 01:22:59,283
We have broken you.

1339
01:23:00,462 --> 01:23:01,893
When you came back to New York.

1340
01:23:03,022 --> 01:23:04,467
You thought you were a man again.

1341
01:23:05,873 --> 01:23:08,933
You thought you could face the one
you're after and shoot it out.

1342
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:11,265
But you're not a man.

1343
01:23:12,295 --> 01:23:13,945
You're only a relic of a man.

1344
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:17,475
Look at you now.

1345
01:23:18,033 --> 01:23:19,020
You're trembling.

1346
01:23:20,779 --> 01:23:22,477
I'm not afraid of you, doctor.

1347
01:23:24,242 --> 01:23:26,602
Seeing you was .. all I needed.

1348
01:23:35,993 --> 01:23:37,368
But you will not shoot.

1349
01:23:38,353 --> 01:23:39,009
No.

1350
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:41,512
Neither of us will do any killing.

1351
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:46,143
I cannot kill you because you
have information I must obtain.

1352
01:23:48,043 --> 01:23:49,358
You cannot kill me.

1353
01:23:50,905 --> 01:23:53,890
Because you lack the brutality
to kill in cold blood.

1354
01:23:56,525 --> 01:23:57,332
And now.

1355
01:24:02,133 --> 01:24:03,676
Now, we'll have our talk.

1356
01:24:05,351 --> 01:24:06,313
By all means.

1357
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:11,444
Otto killed Louis Lepetino.

1358
01:24:12,662 --> 01:24:13,847
Yes, it was Otto.

1359
01:24:14,915 --> 01:24:16,417
He does pretty well what he's told.

1360
01:24:16,775 --> 01:24:17,920
Who shot Ab Parker?

1361
01:24:18,282 --> 01:24:20,299
I shall be very nice
to you and tell you.

1362
01:24:21,655 --> 01:24:22,360
I did.

1363
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:25,934
I sent him a telegram
signed with your name.

1364
01:24:27,333 --> 01:24:29,235
But he did not come at
the time we expected.

1365
01:24:30,342 --> 01:24:33,252
So I remained hidden while you
had your little talk with Anton.

1366
01:24:33,874 --> 01:24:36,240
Then you went to bed.
I waited for your friend.

1367
01:24:37,564 --> 01:24:39,071
It was childishly simple.

1368
01:24:40,439 --> 01:24:41,843
At the sight of the gun ..

1369
01:24:42,401 --> 01:24:43,488
He was frozen.

1370
01:24:45,191 --> 01:24:46,892
