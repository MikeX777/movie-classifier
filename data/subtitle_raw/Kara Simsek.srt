00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,042
Serhan Kebabcilar is the new
candidate of golden belt.

5
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,487
Alexander Muller won golden
belt one month ago...

6
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,082
After the match
with Maurizio Martino.

7
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,281
<i>Turkey</i>

8
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,842
This is an important day
for turkish boxing.

9
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,922
Serhan grew up in Germany
and he is boxing for us now.

10
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,242
Use your left... damn!
Don't forget to use it!

11
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,482
Two boxers began
to close up at the moment.

12
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,562
- This is a hard match.
- Don't forget your left!

13
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,962
Muller got a fist
but couldn't take point fists.

14
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,082
And now this is Muller's time.

15
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,962
- Two boxers are relaxing now.
- Always use your left.

16
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,482
This is black panther Muller,
on the other side Turkish boxer Serhan.

17
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,162
First round is up. Boxers are
taking tips for the second round.

18
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,282
Second round started.

19
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,802
Boxers are trying each other
for points.

20
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,082
Muller seems ambitious.

21
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,242
Serhan giving fists
from left and right.

22
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,239
Serhan got an important fist now.

23
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,242
They are fighting for golden belt.

24
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,322
They are still trying each other.

25
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,522
All fists from Turkish boxer.

26
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,562
- Faster, harder.
- These are mortal fists.

27
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,922
Two boxers in a life match.

28
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,922
Serhan got German now,
come on Serhan.

29
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,802
Come on, great!
Come on.

30
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,162
Take him from two sides!

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,002
Serhan almost fell him down.

32
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,482
And German is on the ground.

33
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,402
Thank god.

34
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,082
Referee counting for Muller.

35
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,762
Three... four... five...

36
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,082
Seven... eight... nine...

37
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,082

38
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,162
Golden belt goes to Serdar.

39
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,962
Champion is
the Turkish boxer Serhan.

40
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,411
My dear son.

41
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,882
Nice news. You can
win this turkish, Maurizio.

42
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,079
I'm fit, after a couple of matches
I'll be the new champion.

43
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,082
And a Turkish can't be a champion
in Europe.

44
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,762
First round starts.

45
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,562
Italian Martino vs
Joe Jackson from US.

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,002
They are boxing for
European Championship.

47
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,682
And winner will box with
champion Serhan.

48
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,082
Black boxer using his long arms.

49
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,282
And Martino knows him.

50
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,442
Martino prefers closing up
and giving fists.

51
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,322
Martino tries to get rival's guard.

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,002
And he hits the American.

53
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,602
One... two... three...
four...

54
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,444
Five... six... seven...
eight... nine... knockout!

55
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,042
And the winner is the Italian Martino.

56
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,639
Thanks for reporting.

57
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,639
May I shoot some pics more?

58
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,642
We have to shoot champion
with golden belt.

59
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,522
Is it easy for you?
So if there is a new match?

60
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,602
If there is somebody
I'm ready.

61
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,682
Incoming of the match is
420.000 Deutsche Mark.

62
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,082
Please sign it.

63
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,682
And it's the net after taxes.

64
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,842
Have a nice day.

65
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,242
I'm a legman, as Serhan's father,
you have contribute?

66
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,322
I don't speak without money.

67
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,519
You got a wealth.

68
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,439
Germany gave luck to us.

69
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,442
There is no poverty anymore,
my son.

70
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,602
You are the champion,
we are the rich.

71
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,322
You have best contribution
for my championship.

72
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,244
Son, you have talent.
You have fist, you have heart.

73
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,002
And now the whole world
knows you, son.

74
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,921
New matches for golden belt
will come with more money.

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,479
These are the best days our lives.

76
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,482
And my mother? My brothers?

77
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,202
Are they happy, dad?

78
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,282
Do they have money?
Do they have peace?

79
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,642
Don't think silly.

80
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,599
We send them some money,
that's all.

81
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,599
Money is happiness.

82
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,602
I want to get back, dad.

83
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,082
Speak with him.
You are his trainer.

84
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,682
You are so hard.

85
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,002
You have to be easy
and compassionate.

86
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,164
He has to fight.
For money, for wealth!

87
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,764
We came here like animals,
going out from cage.

88
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,644
We forgot our humanity,
our identity, our land.

89
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,922
Germans only saw us
like machines.

90
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,842
In fabrics, in laundries,
in mines...

91
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,602
We got in all shits that
never get by kind Germans.

92
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,682
They made prisoners us
for money.

93
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,322
They said "money is
master of the world."

94
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,039
They took us away from
our religion, our land.

95
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,042
Isn't it?

96
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,602
Don't you answer?

97
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,362
When we have enough money
we'll be back.

98
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,802
I won't be a hard worker
in my country!

99
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,042
You fool! Stupid!

100
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,402
You can't work clear!

101
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,882
Take it up!
Come on.

102
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,004
- Don't you see? It's heavy.
- Look at your own work!

103
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,762
If you make it again
I'll kick you out!

104
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,602
Don't try it again bastard!

105
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,762
Wanna try?

106
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,604
Come on, you think a man yourself?
Champion's brother.

107
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,162
Come on!
Come on you bastard!

108
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,762
God! The chain!
Run like hell!

109
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,202
Hook it, come on,
give him a rope!

110
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,922
Hook it. We'll die.

111
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,282
Help, my god, help!

112
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,442
Give him the hook!

113
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,001
Are you ok, Serdar?

114
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,922
I'm ok.

115
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,642
Let him go.
Look up your works.

116
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,522
You lazies!

117
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,642
Behave them like a human!

118
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,881
What the hell is this?

119
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,162
Tank felt down on us
and Serdar saved us.

120
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,602
He wounded and chief
doesn't let us to help him.

121
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,759
Grouches again. Look chief,
if you make it again...

122
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,762
But work stopped, sir.

123
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,239
He never knows the wealth
of people's life.

124
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,766
'Cause he is not human!

125
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,202
Ok, stop. If you make it again
I'll discharge you.

126
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,202
- Are you ok?
- I'm fine, sir.

127
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,042
Ok, you are free
till tomorrow.

128
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,042
Serdar is a strong guy
and has a golden heart.

129
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,842
Shut up! Work!
Hurry up!

130
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,642
- Oh, dad!
- My daughter.

131
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,764
What happened?

132
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,126
Are you wounded?

133
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,964
Unimportant accident.

134
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,362
Serdar is my college hood friend dad.
We couldn't meet for years.

135
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,522
- 'Cause he...
- I left school, sir.

136
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,048
Cause I have to look up
my mother and my brother.

137
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,961
Your dad?

138
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,202
He went to Germany
with my brother 15 years ago.

139
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,319
His brother is a boxer who was champion
on the match yesterday.

140
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,322
I think Serdar
isn't a usual boy too.

141
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,682
He saved his friends today,
everybody loves him there.

142
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,567
I think his brother is the same.
We're proud of him as Turkish.

143
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,719
They can't share this happiness,
Serdar has to work hard.

144
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,722
I'm sorry, Serdar.

145
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,402
If you need anything
I'll be glad to help you.

146
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,402
I don't need anything, sir.
I have to go now.

147
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,722
Serdar, you misunderstood my dad.

148
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,682
Look son, I was a sportsman.
I grew up without family too.

149
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,966
But I'm not you.

150
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,844
You told him, dad.

151
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,604
No, he is a honor person.
I wish I had a son like that.

152
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,604
Here you are, sir.

153
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,562
- And you?
- Thanks.

154
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,126
Cheers.

155
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,729
For champion.

156
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,728
He is not champion.

157
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,762
I'm the champion,
I'm offering you a match.

158
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,519
We will arrange the date.

159
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,522
You can't behave like that.

160
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,879
You old man, get out.

161
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,882
What the hell are you saying?

162
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,162
Let me!
You fuck...

163
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,126
They have to make a match
urgently.

164
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,922
Come on, boxer.
Come on, you champion.

165
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,399
You are a coward. You're going
to your country because of me!

166
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,719
- If it needs I come there too.
- Wait for me, Italian.

167
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,722
When I'm back
I'll change your face.

168
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,919
Don't worry, fuck face!
I'm waiting for you too.

169
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,559
Lick my balls, Italian!

170
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,562
Fuck up, you champion!

171
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,962
- I'll show you!
- You'll creep, Italian.

172
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,882
- Let's speak with his father.
- Good idea.

173
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,162
- Cheers.
- For my championship, honey.

174
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,282
I don't know how we'd arrange
this match in Turkey.

175
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,242
Don't worry, Osman.
We'll arrange it.

176
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,002
Saloon is important,
all TV channels will be there.

177
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,002
We'll get million dollars
with all bets.

178
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,002
If the match is in Turkey
you'll have a wealth.

179
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,207
- And match will be like our way.
- Ok, arrange it in Turkey.

180
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,162
- Thanks.
- Martino!

181
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,882
Match is ok,
it'll be in Turkey.

182
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,889
We'll go next week.

183
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,882
- I'm the champion.
- For champion.

184
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,962
Come here, sweetheart.

185
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,567
They are coming, mom.
My father, my brother are coming.

186
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,842
They'll come here, mother?
I'll see my brother, my dad.

187
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,002
- I miss them.
- I miss them too, my son.

188
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,442
You are my one arm
and Serhan is my other arm.

189
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,802
- But your dad...
- He is our heart, mom.

190
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,402
I hope everything begin new.

191
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,367
Serdar?

192
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,639
- Hi.
- Hi.

193
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,642
Wanna come?

194
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,721
Where?

195
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,325
Don't you like my car?

196
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,922
Come on girl, find anybody
to get in your car.

197
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,642
Huh... what a rude boy.

198
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,322
If I find you again...
I'm a stupid girl.

199
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,001
You're right,
for ex I'm a young too.

200
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,008
You?

201
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,362
I'm on your service, miss.
I'm a playboy.

202
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,045
Come on, you pineapple.

203
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,601
Pineapple?

204
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,242
You are happy today, Serdar.
You won the lottery?

205
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,242
My dad and brother are coming.

206
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,002
- It's wonderful.
- Thanks.

207
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,322
Hey, champion comes
with a lot of money.

208
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,122
He is the European champion.

209
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,402
And when he is the world champion
he'll be rich like Muhammed Ali.

210
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,999
It's a kind of lottery too.

211
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,809
And you will left work, Serdar, hm?

212
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,206
Money is nothing.

213
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,731
What are you doing?

214
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,885
Come on! Work!

215
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,322
- You are a fool.
- I'll kill you bastard!

216
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,001
Come on!

217
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,411
Chief! Boss' calling you.

218
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,922
I was waiting for you,
please walk slow.

219
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,002
I promised myself
not to call you again.

220
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,086
But I waited for you again.

221
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,322
And I left my car too.

222
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,730
Come on, hurry up.

223
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,001
Let me please.

224
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,326
Let my way sister.

225
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,401
So, new comers?

226
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,920
Let me sit, you are rude.

227
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,490
You're not used
to these vehicles, hm?

228
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,445
You're used to luxury cars,
used to money.

229
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,570
I know you're angry
with my dad.

230
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,921
But he loved you
and you misunderstood him.

231
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,326
Speak low, sister.

232
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,006
Watch your way.

233
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,211
Your voice's like a door bell!

234
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,450
You can't speak to me
like that.

235
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,889
Easy, turn your side.

236
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,001
You like it, huh?

237
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,726
Ok, money.

238
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,731
- One person?
- Yes.
- I don't have money.

239
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,642
- I don't use money.
- What?

240
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,126
Are you a big boss, sister?

241
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,206
You woke up my baby!

242
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,290
Is it my problem?
Take him to sleep again.

243
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,528
You rude!

244
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,365
I know your kind of girls well.

245
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,968
You sat near of nice boy,
you sucker.

246
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,809
I can't put up with your sadness.

247
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,240
I want to excuse you
on behalf of my dad.

248
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,968
But you behaved me so rude.

249
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,081
You could say me clear
"I don't want you."

250
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,042
I tried to close up you
for years.

251
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,490
But you didn't want me.

252
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,240
Please be honest with me.

253
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,206
What did I do to you?

254
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,684
You didn't close up me
for years.

255
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,081
First I thought I was a child...

256
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,522
But when I grew up
I fell in love with you.

257
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,604
I don't have a mother
and my dad only works... he works.

258
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,525
And I came for you.

259
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,722
Maybe you could love me too.

260
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,809
You're crying.

261
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,923
I don't care.

262
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,809
I said you're crying.

263
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,525
I said I don't care!

264
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,606
Please don't cry.

265
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,206
Why?

266
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,445
I don't wanna see it.

267
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,487
I love you!

268
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,726
I love you, darling.

269
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,921
Me too.

270
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,002
- You're welcome, Osman.
- Mr. Osman!

271
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,684
Brother!

272
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,411
You're welcome, my husband.

273
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,650
Your son is there.

274
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,322
- My mom.
- My son.

275
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,161
What a nice scene.

276
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,362
- You honored us, my son.
- You are champion, brother.

277
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,570
Ok, silence!

278
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,322
You saw the champion,
now go away.

279
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,525
Contract boy!

280
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,282
He is foolish like his son.

281
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,001
He became mr. Osman in Germany.

282
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,365
My ass, mr.!

283
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,001
He forgot his old days.

284
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,722
- This is my golden belt.
- I'll be a champion, too.

285
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,242
- Where is Serdar?
- He almost came.

286
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,809
- Tea?
- No.

287
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,649
- You spoke to him?
- This is not the time.

288
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,959
So, I'll say...

289
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,962
- These are for you.
- Thanks.

290
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,882
Look at me, my son.
You'll go to match in Turkey.

291
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,602
With Martino, we arranged.

292
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,402
It's better for us.
This is our country, it's guaranteed.

293
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,684
It depends on you, trainer.

294
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,923
It's an important match.

295
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,490
There will be some big money!

296
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,362
The winner will go
to World Championship.

297
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,331
It's more important than money.

298
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,365
I trust you, my son.

299
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,843
They came.

300
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,042
Thanks.

301
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,521
- Brother!
- My brother!

302
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,926
Welcome, dad.

303
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,047
This is my trainer, mr. Hulusi.

304
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,526
Welcome, sir.

305
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,326
Look at me, Serdar.

306
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,206
This is the golden belt.

307
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,362
You honored us, brother.
You are a lion.

308
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,522
He is a lion
but you are a mouse.

309
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,402
Your brother conquered Europe,
he earns a lot of money.

310
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,962
And you? You're giving
poverty to your mom.

311
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,362
We are a family, dad,
and you are master of it.

312
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,999
Have you ever thought about us
till now?

313
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,365
You insolent!

314
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,722
- How you speak with me..
- Easy.

315
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,570
I cooked something for you.

316
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,126
Do you have a feast banquet?

317
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,762
Come on, let's celebrate today.
Let's go to a luxury place.

318
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,125
- Please let me...
- No, you'll come too.

319
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,603
You silly, don't you know
how to use it?

320
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,684
Unmannerly boy.

321
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,445
It's my fault.
You are coming from cave.

322
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,090
This is not a place for us,
please let us go to home.

323
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,091
Shut up, you asshole.

324
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,999
Please mom, only my dad
knows "manner."

325
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,490
Let's go.

326
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,923
He is right, dad.
You are so rude.

327
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,161
Let's go.

328
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,570
You are false,
this is your family.

329
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,999
Family? You saw they are wild.

330
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,685
I'm only interested in Serhan.

331
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,240
I can't understand my dad.

332
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,684
Aren't we his children?

333
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,684
He passionates only with money.

334
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,999
After years he is still the same.

335
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,126
This is his way.

336
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,404
He is a hard man
but I love him.

337
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,001
We love you too.

338
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,002
It's enough, you drunk too much.

339
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,925
Come on trainer, you funny.

340
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,961
Come on trainer. You are funny.

341
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,122
I'll go to house too,
but with bitches.

342
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,759
You are drunk,
you are saying bullshit.

343
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,762
So this is your problem?

344
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,007
To have fun is my right.

345
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,882
Wanna come with me?

346
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,248
No, I'll go to another place.

347
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,282
So, have some fun!

348
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,769
What a "kind" guy
anyway, never mind.

349
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,485
Come here, ladies.

350
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,883
Come on dance, you nasty.

351
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,564
Play it again!

352
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,371
What the hell is this?

353
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,769
Don't you see?
I'm dancing with bitches.

354
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,202
- Is this a disco?
- Come on, up your ass!

355
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,560
Get out!

356
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,883
What are you saying, you suckers!

357
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,849
- Hey, be careful.
- It's so late.

358
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,766
You are the father of Serdar
but be kind.

359
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,279
What will happen
if I'm not kind?

360
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,611
This is not Germany!

361
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,362
- We'll call the police.
- Police? Call your mom!

362
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,086
Ok, it's enough!

363
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,281
Enough?

364
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,362
- What's that?
- Your dad's quarreling.

365
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,562
Let him go!
He is our dad!

366
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,246
Are you ok, dad?

367
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,962
Get off your dirty hands!

368
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,202
This is my lion. This is my son!

369
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,927
Here you are, sir?

370
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,883
I'll meet with mr. Nevzat.

371
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,882
- He is upstairs, sir.
- I'm his old friend.

372
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,007
Please come in.

373
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,082
Hulusi! My friend, you're welcome.

374
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,044
- Thanks, my friend.
- Where were you?

375
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,362
You're right, I'm here for you.

376
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,444
You're welcome, sir.
It's a pleasure welcoming you here.

377
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,682
This is a nice place,
thanks for your kindness.

378
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,371
It will be a nice journey for us.

379
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,522
I was wondering, Turkey
is a nice country.

380
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,322
You like it, sweetheart?

381
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,402
It's a fantastic place.

382
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,962
I will match here and we'll
have a nice holiday here.

383
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,562
Harder!
You have to be faster!

384
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,002
We came to Turkey
to arrange this match.

385
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,763
Martino must listen to us.

386
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,121
Boxing means money.

387
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,482
And money always earns
by us, by mafia.

388
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,082
We have to arrange it
for bets.

389
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,842
I spoke with Martino.
He won't lose the match.

390
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,166
Hello,
we want to meet you.

391
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,163
Are you legmen?
No, we are fan of you.

392
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,086
Turkish people are so kind.

393
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,282
Sir, would you want to say
something before the match?

394
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,002
Newspapers say golden belt
will be Turkey's again.

395
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,122
Turkish sport-lovers
will see a wonderful match.

396
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,482
And championship case:
2 months ago German Muller...

397
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,167
Got golden belt from me as a deposit.
Golden Belt is mine forever.

398
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,279
To shoot a movie
with winner will be sensational.

399
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,089
It will be a box office movie.

400
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,562
Ok, get ready, we will shoot it
with winner.

401
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,682
- I came here for you.
- You always come for me.

402
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,802
Your life will go like that
by waiting me.

403
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,046
I'll always come exhausted to home.
Will you get used to it?

404
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,002
I can't give you a rich life.

405
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,162
So, please think twice.

406
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,164
I love you Serdar
and it's more important than everything.

407
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,247
You are still a baby
who imagines the dreams.

408
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,602
Please come to us tonight,
my father will be glad too.

409
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,962
I can't, this is
the match day of Serhan.

410
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,002
When I was young
I couldn't win this belt, son.

411
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,042
But you won it
and you have to save it too.

412
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,361
Get this match.

413
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,842
You are fit.
If you hit strong, you'll get it.

414
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,922
Ok, you are ready son.

415
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,962
Come on, time is up,
crowd's waiting for us.

416
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,242
- Good luck, son.
- Thanks, sir.

417
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,920
And the day is today.

418
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,162
This is the most important
boxing match in Turkey.

419
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,082
European Championship
for Golden Belt.

420
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,722
Turkish Serhan Kebabcilar
vs Italian Maurizio Martino.

421
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,762
They are getting ready
for the first round.

422
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,402
And referee calls them into the ring.

423
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,647
Match started.

424
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,564
Martino prefers to stay far...

425
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,644
And Serhan wants to be closer.

426
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,928
They are trying each other.

427
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,809
Martino begins his fists...

428
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,041
And also Serhan replies to him.

429
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,405
Martino began to hit harder.

430
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,200
This is Serhan's hard times.

431
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,086
He's surrounded.

432
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,849
They are more careful now.

433
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,961
Serhan trying to get
to Martino's guard.

434
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,371
Martino is in front of ropes, now...

435
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,200
And he began to reply
harder, now.

436
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,359
Be careful, son.

437
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,885
This is Martino's left.

438
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,086
Now, this is Serhan's time.

439
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,167
Don't close him, Martino.

440
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,927
Faster! Faster, son.

441
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,082
Martino earns some points, now.

442
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,889
Also Serhan earns, too.

443
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,002
And round is up.

444
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,246
They are relaxing now.

445
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,282
Don't get excited, son,
always hear me.

446
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,762
When you saw him ready
give him your left.

447
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,002
Don't close him up, Martino,
you have to stay far.

448
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,602
Always try beneath,
you'll win.

449
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,371
And this is the second round.

450
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,089
Martino entered faster, now.

451
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,724
He earns a lot of points.

452
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,211
Faster! Faster,
even more than a second.

453
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,082
Serhan closing up
but he can't save his own guard.

454
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,159
And Martino begins again.

455
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,810
Serhan can't make anything.

456
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,803
One fist
and another one.

457
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,042
Serhan is a blind mood now.
Referee has to stop the match.

458
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,121
But Martino doesn't stop.

459
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,962
Left and right,
he doesn't stop.

460
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,889
And Serhan felt down.

461
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,642
- Referee counting now.
- One... two... three...

462
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,602
- Four... five...
- Serhan trying to get up.

463
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,091
- But he can't get up.
- Six... seven...

464
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,530
- It seems impossible.
- Eight... nine...

465
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,122
- My brother, Serhan.
- I can't take breath.

466
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,208
Knockout!

467
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,250
Let's go to hospital urgently.

468
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,291
- Champion.
- Champion.

469
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,482
We are sorry,
we lost him.

470
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,166
It seems he got a poison.

471
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,849
We took him in operation
but unfortunately lost him.

472
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,442
He was poisoned?
This is a murder.

473
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,450
I don't wanna believe it, Serdar.

474
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,803
I don't wanna accept
he is dead.

475
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,644
Shut up! Enough!
Enough!

476
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,564
If it's better quarrel me
if it's better cry.

477
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,922
Please don't be sad anymore.

478
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,802
How would I say you don't want me
to my children?

479
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,522
You never saw me
as your wife during these years.

480
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,602
This is not truth?
Are you still accusing me?

481
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,722
What a woman you are,
you poor disher woman.

482
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,166
I went to Germany
because of you.

483
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,882
- And you are using our son...
- I'm so sad, my son is dead.

484
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,162
- You gave me a bad luck.
- But I won't have a bad luck.

485
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,722
It will your destiny,
I'm leaving this home.

486
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,325
We are sorry, Serdar.

487
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,285
- Thank you, bros.
- We wish RIP for him.

488
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,450
Get out, you lazies!

489
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,769
He is dead and that's all,
now work!

490
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,281
Let me go!

491
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,648
Come on, get up!
Get up I said, fight!

492
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,610
He is stronger than his brother.

493
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,682
True, he saved workers last day.

494
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,530
He can take vengeance.

495
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,886
What are you talking about?

496
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,442
His brother was killed,
this is an organized work.

497
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,722
I'm sorry sir, he doesn't have respect
even for dead.

498
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,122
Don't care about it son, come on,
let's speak with you.

499
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,883
It was hard to take it again
but it's mine again, now.

500
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,088
Even if it costed a life
it's mine again.

501
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,922
It was your right, honey,
nobody can't take it from you.

502
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,642
I'll win all matches
to be the world champion.

503
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,450
I'm not afraid to kill!

504
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,164
Somebody wants to meet you, champion.

505
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,325
- Hello.
- Hello.

506
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,610
- We came for an opportunity.
- For what?

507
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,362
- We want to shoot a movie with you.
- Movie? But I'm a boxer.

508
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,128
It'll e easy for you,
we'll pay well.

509
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,249
We only need 3 months
if you accept to stay in Turkey.

510
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,005
Seems nice but my honey will act too.

511
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,520
- Sure.
- Ok, deal.

512
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,082
You'll begin from last point
of your brother Serdar.

513
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,162
But I'm not a sportsman.
I don't know anything about boxing.

514
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,802
We arranged everything, son.
I'll support you.

515
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,162
And don't be sad again,
you can pay it after match.

516
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,042
Therefore you can take
your brother's vengeance.

517
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,325
This is a kind of heritage of him.

518
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,362
You have to be like him,
Serdar, you'll be the best boxer.

519
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,364
Ok, give your hands.

520
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,762
First, you have to be muscular.

521
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,162
Than we'll work on the technique.

522
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,121
Action!

523
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,082
- Angela.
- Martino, sweetheart.

524
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,762
- I love you.
- I love you too.

525
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,049
No break,
you'll sweat.

526
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,525
You have to sweat!

527
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,562
You'll run until you'll be of steel!

528
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,771
Run! Run like hell!

529
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,362
You'll believe this work,
you'll believe in me.

530
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:57,562
You won't be human anymore!
You won't feel like a human!

531
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,883
When you won't be human anymore,
you'll be ok.

532
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,722
- Rest.
- Ok.
- Ok.

533
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,520
Well...

534
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,802
- We are together tonight?
- Sure, darling.

535
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,325
Now... go!

536
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,842
You don't believe me,
you don't believe in work!

537
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,162
If you won't success
let's leave this work, son.

538
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,525
You must success, Serdar.

539
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,362
What happened?
You were a honored person...

540
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,322
You're not, Serdar.
That I knew?

541
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,086
Are you afraid?

542
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,450
Ok, I'm going to stay alone
with your fear.

543
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,849
Stop, don't leave me alone.

544
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,002
- Believe me. I'll win!
- I love you.

545
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,201
Action.

546
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,919
- You are so beautiful, darling.
- I love you.

547
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,922
- Cheers for love.
- Cheers for love.

548
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,891
It's for you, sweetheart.

549
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,122
It's more important
than the golden belt, for me.

550
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,842
You'll see the golden belt
will be mine forever.

551
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,689
I love you, Martino.

552
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,325
I'll be the world champion.

553
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,925
Stop, congrats, bravo.

554
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,369
I'm the greatest.

555
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,522
Box is the hardest sport,
needs more passion.

556
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,402
Begins with athleticism,
stops with force.

557
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,564
You have to be
a complete sportsman.

558
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,285
You'll work more, son,
there is no other way.

559
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,522
You can't win today,
if you want let's stop.

560
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,882
No, let's continue.
I'll play for my wealth.

561
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,362
Ok, time is up. It's ok for today.

562
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:33,362
This is an antique
turkish revolver.

563
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,642
Ok, I'll buy it.

564
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,282
Darling, this is your birthday gift.

565
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,644
Congrats, mrs..

566
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,042
Don't use one arm,
use 'em all.

567
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,482
Don't stop,
do it faster.

568
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,282
Now here we are again,
you have only 25 seconds.

569
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,722
You'll be a sport god,
you have to believe it.

570
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,682
It's almost done,
you'll be the greatest Serdar.

571
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,529
You'll be the invincible champion.

572
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,171
Right, right, harder.

573
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,682
You'll hire your left
for the time.

574
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,602
Don't lose your timing.

575
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,164
Bravo, wonderful.

576
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,482
Ok, ok son.

577
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,282
You are ok. Your first rival
will be the American Jackson.

578
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,169
My god, please save my son.

579
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,082
<i>Black thunder</i>

580
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,803
And the match starts with the gong.

581
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,562
Turkish boxer Serdar
vs American boxer Jackson.

582
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,166
Serdar seems relaxed.

583
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,002
Winner will go to
the European Championship.

584
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,442
Two rivals are poised.

585
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,762
American tries to earn points.

586
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,479
But Serdar's careful.

587
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,925
Faster!

588
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,891
And Serdar's beginning
to earn points.

589
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,044
American wants to go beneath
but he got two fists above.

590
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,811
Serdar's working serial.

591
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,246
He hits than far,
hits than far.

592
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,650
Use your left!

593
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,959
And with Serdar's left
American felt down.

594
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,962
- One... two...
- Referee counting.

595
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,002
Four... five...

596
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,002
- He is trying to wake up.
- Seven... eight...

597
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,891
Nine...

598
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,719
- Knockout!
- And the winner is Serdar.

599
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,722
- Turkey!
- Turkey!

600
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,602
I won, I don't know
what's the lost.

601
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:54,362
Ok son, you are ready for the match.

602
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,962
Your new rival is German
Alexander Muller.

603
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,282
Muller came here to win you
then match with Martino.

604
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,802
You have to win, son.

605
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,722
You have to be faster to win, son.

606
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:17,122
Faster! Faster!

607
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,530
Turn me, hit now. Faster!

608
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,369
Serdar vs Muller now.

609
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,689
Muller seems faster.

610
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,091
- But Serdar's closing up to him.
- Finish him! Finish!

611
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,121
Serdar has a wonderful technique.

612
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,369
Muller trying to resistance...

613
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,089
But it seems impossible.

614
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,923
And Muller felt down.

615
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,764
Come on Martino, close up to girl.

616
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,246
I'm afraid, darling.

617
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:44,371
- I'm anxious for the last match.
- Don't be afraid, darling.

618
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:51,847
I love you, Martino.
These are the best days of our lifes.

619
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,966
Stop, cam is going to this side.

620
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,325
Well? You like it, boss?

621
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,202
Serdar's got the Spanish too.
Serdar is black thunder!

622
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,644
I'm going too.

623
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,291
What? Are you going?

624
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,171
You don't have money anymore.

625
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,130
You are now a poor man.

626
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,922
Kook at me, be careful
or I'll slap you.

627
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,121
Come on, why don't you try?

628
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,802
If you don't have money,
you are nothing.

629
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,849
Even you don't have the energy.

630
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,959
Never call me
if you don't have money.

631
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,849
So long... "man."

632
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,889
- We are ready, sir.
- Ok.

633
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,002
This is the European Championship belt.

634
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,442
It's mine, I'll be the world's best too.

635
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,085
Write it as it
to your newspapers.

636
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,689
Movie is ended, thanks folks,
thanks champion.

637
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,883
I thank you too, my friends.

638
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,691
Cheers to everybody.

639
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,571
You came to see me?

640
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,130
We are offering a new match,
Martino.

641
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,371
With whom? Is there anybody
who can make it with me here?

642
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,564
- Serdar.
- Who is he? I don't know him.

643
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,962
He's brother of the dead boxer.

644
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,362
I want 100 millions,
for less it's impossible.

645
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,122
- Ok?
- Your check is ready.

646
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,364
Ok, let me know the date.

647
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,522
We'll let you know.

648
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,522
- So long.
- So long too.

649
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,491
- Turkey gives us luck.
- Cheers for boxing.

650
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,881
- You won't accept this match.
- Why? I'm invincible.

651
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,883
Serdar seems professional too.

652
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:40,210
He won 4 matches, it's serious.

653
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,567
What a success! I won 34!
Daddy, don't be sad for me.

654
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,162
- Martino can lose this time.
- We can arrange the match for Martino.

655
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,085
He doesn't work for months,
he is not fit anymore.

656
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,042
Look up your work, trainer,
and rest is our work.

657
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,802
Serdar's father is poor now
and we'll earn millions again.

658
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,842
You'll be the world champion, Serdar!

659
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,250
So we are here again, Osman.

660
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,802
Do you wanna leave this poverty?

661
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,166
What will you do?

662
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,242
We'll pay a lot of money
and Serdar won't go to the match.

663
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,562
No,.. no! You will be faster.

664
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,042
It'll be an easy match,
I always trust myself.

665
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,082
You only think about my pay
in America, that's all.

666
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,802
We are with you
but we need guarantee too.

667
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,044
I'm afraid for the match.

668
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,450
I don't wanna lose you.

669
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,849
Don't be pessimistic.

670
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,722
You are the source of my force.

671
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,924
- I'll cry.
- No, don't cry, never.

672
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,850
I'll win this for me, for you,
for my family.

673
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,444
- And vengeance feelings?
- I don't have vengeance feelings.

674
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,447
I only feel for win,
this is a no merciful fight.

675
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,202
After match, there will be
a new life for us.

676
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,842
I believe you sweetheart,
I won't cry.

677
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,885
My god, please save my son.

678
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,491
And this is the biggest match.

679
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,682
"Black thunder" Serdar
vs Maurizio Martino.

680
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,162
This is the day for
Europe's golden belt.

681
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,246
- Are you ready?
- Yes sir.

682
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,322
I'm fit! I will blow him up today.

683
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,802
He will kiss my ass,
nobody can't take my belt.

684
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,962
- Ok son, this is your time.
- I'll win, sir.

685
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,962
- Ok, son.
- I'll do it, sir.

686
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,922
Let us alone, trainer,
I'll speak with Serdar alone.

687
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,530
Listen, don't go to this match.

688
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:44,962
I lost everything,
I'm lonely.

689
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,571
I'm your father,
understand me?

690
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,325
You are my last hope.
Serhan's dead, I don't wanna lose you too.

691
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,522
Martino is a professional,
you don't have the experience.

692
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,200
He'll kill you too.

693
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,882
You listen to me,
I'm your father.

694
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,407
They won't do any murder again,
I'll take my brother's revenge.

695
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,442
They're playing dirty games
but I'll blast this champion.

696
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:19,042
I said you won't go to the match!

697
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,525
My son...

698
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,050
Please forgive me.

699
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,683
Money stole everything from me.

700
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,371
I hate myself, go to the match.

01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:54,602
Go and win! This is the time for believe,
show it to everybody.

702
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,322

They are speaking with fists.

711
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:00,045
