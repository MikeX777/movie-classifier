1
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,876
No, I'm not paying that,
Forget it!

2
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,324
thank you.

3
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,159
Sir lancelot, Could you please get down.

4
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,298
Fine.

5
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,144
♪ Well, I found that Silver lining ♪

6
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:57,565
♪ On the day that you were gone ♪

7
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:04,739
♪ satin sheets surrounded me
all night then all day long ♪

8
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,806
Alright, sir lancelot, I'm going.

9
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:16,895
Hope you're happy.
I'm taking the candy corns.

10
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,147
Happy halloween.

11
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,734
T.. t.. terrible, we'll make examples out of you.

12
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,236
I could stutter all the way through

13
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,654
But I'm still shaking the flu.

14
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,489
I'm nice with it, want me on your shit

15
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,908
Then there's a price with it
Till I'm flat and I'm fifty.

16
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,743
They're going platinum with my rap tune.

17
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,203
Nice with the vocabulary,

18
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,830
These ain't regular lyrics, nigga.

19
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,165
This is your obituary.

20
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,493
hello?

21
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,544
Ha!

22
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,300
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

23
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,887
Maybe I made a mistake.

24
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,224
Hi. I'm chris.

25
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:06,309
no, there's no mistake.

26
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,811
Ah, actually you're just
a little early, that's all.

27
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,022
Well... Sorry.

28
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,576
I brought some pumpkin bread.

29
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,286
Thank you.
That's really sweet.

30
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,455
yeah.

31
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,082
Happy halloween.

32
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,544
Sure.

33
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,961
Thanks for inviting me.

34
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,644
Ok.

35
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,213
Fucking get him!

36
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,014
Get him. How did you find us?

37
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,194
Fucking get him!

38
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,032
No, no, let go,
Let go, let go.

39
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,829
Welcome to your murder.

40
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,915
His little cardboard
outfit really freaked me out.

41
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,584
I don't know where the hell
that light chain came from,

42
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,210
That wasn't there.

43
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,878
You were great,
you were so sexy screaming like that.

44
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,089
I don't know,
his costume's pretty hilarious.

45
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:01,675
I think he might be retarded.

46
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,845
You know, lexi, I don't know
If it's the best idea

47
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,015
To use a cell phone
in the middle of a crime.

48
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,266
Well, snapping photos

49
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,768
Isn't a great idea either, dildo!

50
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,102
Hello, hey...

51
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,438
Hey, let's go to Cicero's party.
Why?

52
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,690
This is the party,

53
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:17,982
We've been planning this for weeks

54
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,609
And Cicero's a fucking ass hole.

55
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,444
What's this shit?

56
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,404
I just got off the phone with
Alexander, he's on his way over.

57
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,947
Look, I don't think we actually thought

58
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,366
Someone would be stupid enough to show up.

59
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,867
The invitation said
"Murder party."

60
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,744
If some jack ass is
dumb enough to come here

61
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,037
Then he deserves to die.

62
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,330
He's a white male, he's perfect.

63
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,832
Are you republican?

64
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,000
Don't make this political.
This is about art.

65
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,002
There's nothing more political than art.

66
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,087
Oh, this is about impressing
Alexander and you know that, Paul.

67
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,589
Fuck you, Sky, I want a grant.

68
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,384
Look, Cicero's party is like
ten blocks away,

69
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,926
Let's just go there.

70
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,011
This is enough.

71
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,429
We have to wait for Alexander.

72
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,430
Let's vote.

73
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,349
Fuck a vote.

74
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,226
This has been decided
and what the christ, Sky?

75
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,269
You're the one that brought
the jug of acid,

76
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,314
I mean, hardcore, right?

77
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,191
Bill? What about you?

78
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,197
What?

79
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,408
Yeah? You ready to murder this dildo?

80
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,494
I didn't sign up for a second
degree assault party.

81
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,287
Fine.

82
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,251
Ok, what if I had an idea
that will make everybody happy?

83
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,879
No one has to die
But it's violent,

84
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:25,550
And when we're done,
we'll rule the scene.

85
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,803
Ok, so, what is it?

86
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,934
Is... are there raisins in this?

87
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,898
Are they organic?

88
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:44,569
Oh my, god, you're allergic,
You're not gonna die, are you?

89
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,279
Should I call 911?

90
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:47,614
No!

91
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,407
I'll be fine, I just get really dizzy.

92
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,992
I just need to sit down.
I get really dizzy.

93
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,288
It's preservatives, I'm allergic to 'em.

94
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,457
Here. Alright, we'll then,
then I can get back to...

95
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,339
Oops!

96
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,511
Smells like cut grass.

97
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:16,559
What?

98
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:29,948
Sky just died.

99
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,449
Oh, shit!

100
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,034
You killed her.

101
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,790
You're bread.

102
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,750
Yeah!

103
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,293
Yeah!

104
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,421
You! I'm gonna kill him
Right now!

105
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,090
Lock this mother fucker down!

106
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:53,220
Wait, wait, we gotta wait for
Alexander before we do anything.

107
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,306
this is happening!

108
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,809
Yeah, yeah!

109
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,019
What?! What, mother fucker, what?!

110
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:03,272
I wanna hear the screaming.
What? What? What?

111
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,399
Please don't kill me.
I don't know what happened.

112
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,360
Aaaaaah!
I don't know what happened.

113
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:08,653
Yeah!
No, no, no, no.

114
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:12,198
Yeah! Aaah! Aah!

115
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:17,537
Burn! Yeah!

116
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,581
Oh! Oh! Oh!
I'm so sorry.

117
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,458
I'm so sorry I did that.

118
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,211
I'm sorry! Are you...
Oh, fuck!

119
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:28,798
I'm so sorry, please forgive me.
I didn't mean to do that.

120
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:33,720
Ha ha ha! Oh, my god!

121
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,017
What's happening?
I don't know. It says "Acetic aci

122
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:42,395
Well it smells like...
Vinegar?

123
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,606
I'll look it up on the internet.

124
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,194
I think it's vinegar.

125
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,821
Asshole.

126
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,072
Hey! And I thought we agreed

127
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,033
No alcohol until the deed was done.

128
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,993
Hey!
I just did the deed!

129
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,745
And besides there's a pile of cocaine

130
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,621
On the table and Sky is dead.

131
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:04,083
Coke, isn't a depressant,
it enhances my powers.

132
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,459
I'm just saying you know...

133
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,587
What we said was no alcohol and no weed.

134
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,465
It's vinegar.

135
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,552
Vinegar? Great.
We.. we can pickle him to death.

136
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,769
Aaa!

137
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,646
Oh my god, it's Alexander.
He's here.

138
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,314
This is a cluster fuck!

139
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,983
He's gonna think we're a bunch of dildos.

140
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,150
Not if doesn't see the body.

141
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,318
We should hide the body.

142
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,905
That's exactly what I just said.

143
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,323
Alexander! Hey.

144
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:40,036
Yeah, that's cool,
I'll be down in a sec.

145
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,287
Maybe we should chop up her body

146
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,705
And take her teeth or something.

147
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,832
Just hide the body.
Use the plastic!

148
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,834
No, no plastic is for this guy.

149
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,796
Who fucking gives a shit!

150
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:54,300
Come on.
Aa!

151
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,802
Alright, how do you wanna do this?
Like a burrito.

152
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:59,639
Just lift.
Just roll her.

153
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,686
Ok, bring her over here.

154
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,272
Oh!
You...

155
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,899
Alright.

156
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:11,275
Oh my god, just drag her.

157
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,361
Pick her up!
Pick her up!

158
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,037
Jesus christ, she's heavy!

159
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:28,292
You got her?
One, two, three, go. Ah!

160
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:33,506
Ok.
Ok, shut the bin.

161
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,995
Aaa! You scared me.
Ha ha ha.

162
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,832
Lexi, you look smashing tonight.
Thanks.

163
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,670
Aah! Aah!
Aw!

164
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,588
You alright,
Are you alright?

165
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,721
Everyone, this is Hell Hammer,
He's part Dingo.

166
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,639
Oh, his costume is adorable.

167
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,100
And this is Zycho, my new best friend.

168
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,980
What are you supposed to be, Paul?

169
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:34,483
Vampire, er,
19th century vampire.

170
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,902
Me too.

171
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,862
Where'd you get those fangs?

172
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:42,116
Uh, from a... a goth store,
you know,

173
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,118
Downtown, they're resin, actually.

174
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,037
Take 'em off, Paul.

175
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,415
What?
Take off your vampire fangs.

176
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,584
Are you serious?

177
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:01,886
Ok.

178
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:03,303
Headshot...

179
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,808
Take them off, Paul.

180
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,312
And take off you vampire coat.

181
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,154
And your vampire shirt.

182
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,971
And now take off your vampire pants.

183
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:09,162
You're hairy.
Mhh!

184
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:10,830
Ok, so...

185
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:12,414
Who is this dildo?

186
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,208
Can you believe it?

187
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,754
Achew!

188
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,756
I'm sorry, I'm really allergic.

189
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:24,051
I'm just gonna take him outside.
Come on.

190
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:26,553
Hey, Zycho, grab this guy's wallet.

191
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,348
Hm, aw.

192
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:43,321
Christopher S. Holly, you're old.

193
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,582
Oh! I needed good dentists.

194
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:56,834
Is this guy any good?

195
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,585
I feel like I'm getting a cavity.

196
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,214
Hey, where's Sky?
No show.

197
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,757
I think she went to Cicero's party.

198
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,592
What a dirty whore.

199
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,636
Anyway what are the pitches, bitches?

200
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:08,804
What are we doing?

201
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,598
Don't blow this, Macon.

202
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,352
Mmh. Ok, we're gonna cut
this guy in a half,

203
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,145
We're gonna dump his body
in a vacant lot,

204
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,437
We're gonna use the pressed up things

205
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:18,939
As part of the paper mache elements

206
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,483
Of a massive multi media meta structure

207
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:24,070
With participational, er...

208
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:26,280
Er, you know what?
Let me start over.

209
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,032
Um, maybe something
a little more progressive.

210
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:30,951
We'll staple a pancake to his face

211
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,329
And push him in front of the 'G' train

212
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,749
And no one will ever know so...

213
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:39,585
Ever-what happens...
Lexi, what do you got.

214
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,755
Well, I've been working on a
video installation and it's almost done.

215
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,673
I was thinking about incorporating

216
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:47,301
Tonight's events into the installation.

217
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,426
Well, come here.

218
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,055
Come here, I'll show you.

219
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,309
I call it um, "Validiction In Black".

220
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,525
So I wanna keep it
really abstract like this.

221
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,529
Aaa!
Aren't they pretty?

222
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,948
Oh, that's me! That's me!

223
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,699
I couldn't find a real one
so I totally...

224
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,166
Oh, god, it's so good.

225
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:20,834
You know, I've already got
a venue for it.

226
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,211
Really? What venue?

227
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,380
Ah, europholies.
It's right off Bedford.

228
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,839
Yeah, it's that juice bar

229
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,716
With a digital projector
in the back... Nice.

230
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:31,137
Oh, Paul, you're not mad?
What do you propose?

231
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:34,598
I think my photographs
speak for themselves.

232
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,100
Paul, come here.

233
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,977
I was just messing around
with you earlier.

234
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:41,105
It's good to have the blood
pumping through your veins.

235
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,984
Paul, your photographs...

236
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:48,321
Are excelsior.

237
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,906
Who is this guy?
I mean, why is he even here?

238
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,574
Zycho, he's my drug dealer.

239
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:56,370
He sells out of the back
of his parents' perogi shop.

240
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,956
It's alright, he's not gonna
Hurt you, his gun is fake.

241
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,958
It's just part of his costume.

242
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:04,044
What's his costume?

243
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,588
Paul, I'm gonna need you to trust me,

244
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:10,217
You're the front runner
for the grant.

245
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:14,512
(French)
What you got, buddy?

246
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,099
I don't know.
I was gonna cut his dick off

247
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,185
And set him on fire.

248
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,813
I'm not gonna lie to you, dudes.

249
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,899
I really wanted you to challenge
yourselves on this one.

250
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:33,073
I wanted you to forget that
I have access to grant money.

251
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:36,369
In excess of $300,000,
Did I mention that?

252
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,290
You need to defend your territory,

253
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,625
Your artistic jurisdiction,

254
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,836
Your hunting grounds.

255
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,798
Your prey is inspiration.

256
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:54,928
Inspiration is shit!
Unless you execute.

257
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,351
Tonight we execute.

258
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:03,979
In three years...
Fuck that, six months...

259
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:10,110
There's gonna be a starbucks,
whole foods, Jamba Juice, cozy.

260
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:13,030
Where's the inspiration in that?

261
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,115
And this warehouse...

262
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:18,035
Will no doubt be converted
into over priced condos

263
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,038
Marketed as artist lofts.

264
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,415
That's bullshit.

265
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,835
No, these will beartist lofts... Ours.

266
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,549
Because what we do here tonight
will change things forever.

267
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:35,219
Don't think of this dildo
as a victim.

268
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,595
Think of him as a collaborator.

269
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:41,141
It's his privilege to be here
this evening.

270
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:46,646
I ask for one thing, so precious little.

271
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,567
When our master piece is complete,

272
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:52,111
And the coroner's report is back in,

273
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:56,782
They will read the cause of death... Art.

274
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,967
So, think beyond
splattering blood on canvas

275
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:18,678
Or death by paper mache.

276
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:22,766
Jackson Pollock is boring.

277
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:27,729
And I've seen that scorsese film
with that guy.

278
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:32,234
Think hyper-artistic, think...

279
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:36,405
No.

280
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:42,077
The art is the act itself.

281
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,789
We'll wait until the Witching Hour,

282
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,334
And then we'll stab him,

283
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:52,463
We'll all stab him till he dies.

284
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,141
The Witching Hour is brilliant.

285
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,393
The Witching Hour is midnight.
Yeah.

286
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,978
Yeah, I know what Witching Hour is.

287
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,647
I'm saying I'm gonna need
some food before then.

288
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,939
You wanna order food?

289
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,690
Yeah, I can pick it up incognito.

290
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,318
Also, Macon, I want you to get some cake.

291
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:17,530
We can't have a party without cake.
And pizza.

292
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:18,864
No pizza.

293
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:22,159
I feel like...
Chinese. William?

294
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,119
I'll eat anything.
Quail.

295
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,829
How about thai food, you like Thai food.

296
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,623
I had thai food yesterday.
Sushi?

297
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,249
I don't really like sushi.

298
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,792
Yeah, I think we should rule
Asian out all together.

299
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,752
Cheese burgers.
I'm not even hungry.

300
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,421
Do you guys wanna do like breakfast,
like pancakes or something?

301
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:35,964
Milk shakes.

302
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,384
I could do mexican. William?
I'll eat anything.

303
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,469
Let's let Zycho decide.
Zycho?

304
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,055
Do they have fish and chips?
I smell vinegar.

305
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,307
Oh, yeah, how mod.
Anything but fish.

306
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,266
Just get a fucking pizza!

307
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,601
With sausage.
Plain.

308
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,936
Shit.
Goddamn it!

309
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,569
Shit! Shit!

310
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:09,331
Shit! Shit! Shit!

311
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,333
There he is!

312
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,617
Aah!

313
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:58,213
Ah! There he is!
There he is!

314
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,881
Motherfucker!

315
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,779
Ah, shit!

316
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,823
You know, I'm getting a glare
on his glasses.

317
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:09,993
Can I get one of you guys
to just go over...

318
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,885
I got the pizza.

319
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,014
Lexi?

320
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,850
Is this the cake?
Yeah.

321
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,351
The cake is for him.

322
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,899
Lexi's pussy screamed at me.
It what?

323
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:56,665
Alexander, I am bored.

324
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,959
Go grab your nipples,
and I'll spike these guys.

325
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:03,213
Quit now. No to this...

326
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,513
Can I use your cellphone,
Please?

327
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,265
Oh, I would but...

328
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,852
You shouldn't use a cellphone
while committing a crime.

329
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,953
Hi? Yeah, can you actually
come down here please?

330
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:38,206
Yeah, the address
should be on my computer.

331
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:40,876
No these guys are...

332
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,505
Ok, everyone, Zycho brought us a treat.

333
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,593
I call this extreme truth or dare.

334
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:53,680
All the kids are doing it in Belarus.

335
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:56,725
What is it?
Sodium Amytal.

336
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:57,976
It's truth serum.

337
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,645
Alexander, I love it.

338
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,188
There's not even enough needles,
I'm not sharing this.

339
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,566
I'll share with Lexi.
Eww!

340
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,318
That's creepy, and I don't do needles.

341
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:09,362
You can't even feel a needle.
I can.

342
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,573
You did not feel the one
that I've just inject you.

343
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,032
You fucking prick!

344
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,117
Hey, relax, sweetheart.

345
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:17,245
Hey, wolf man?
Mmh?

346
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,039
For you.

347
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,584
Oh.

348
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,878
I'll do that shit.

349
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,047
Hey, Zycho, let me get mine.

350
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,720
Let's explore the darkness.

351
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,477
Yeah, no thank you.
Don't be such a dildo, Paul.

352
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:43,480
Come on, dildo.

353
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,607
Yeah, man up, Paul.

354
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,776
Paul, this is extreme truth or dare,

355
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:52,071
The real CIA, KGB shit.
Hm.

356
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,782
KGB use pure alcohol.

357
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,951
I still don't understand why,
I mean...

358
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,870
A similar effect as Barbiturate.

359
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:01,331
Paul, I have a big bag of tricks
planned for tonight

360
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,375
So forget about this guy for now

361
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,628
And, uh, stop bringing us down,
man. You're a real drag.

362
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,756
Paul, is his own little Barbiturate.

363
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:15,178
Lexi is my new best friend.

364
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:20,266
Paul puts the bitch in Barbiturate.

365
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,019
Bill's my new best friend.

366
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,479
There are two r's in Barbiturate,

367
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,732
But Americans don't care.

368
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:30,694
Paul needs to have his...
I'm having a gas.

369
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:32,320
This is fun.

370
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,781
What is that?

371
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:38,577
Sodium Amytal, same thing.

372
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:42,748
Uh, I saw that one coming.

373
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:45,166
The chainsaw.
Ha ha ha.

374
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,670
This actually is pretty, um,
fang-tastic.

375
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:58,304
Paul's pussy has a smaller
clitoris than Lexi's.

376
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,556
I don't think that one's funny.

377
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:01,474
Dudes, let's stick to the point.

378
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,894
We're getting off track and
I need something more concrete

379
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:05,395
If I wanna turn this
in to the boss.

380
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,565
Well, there's no need to wig out.

381
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,071
Oh, look.

382
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:19,576
What in the hell does he want?
To extinguish our fun.

383
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:23,121
Do you have something to say?
Mmmh.

384
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:27,793
Is it a pun?
Oh, shit, he's got a pun.

385
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:33,924
F.. f.. forget it, I.. I.. I think,
I think I missed my moment.

386
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,341
Say it!

387
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,428
It's not...It's not gonna be
funny anymore.

388
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,221
Hey, Macon, grab me that
chainsaw.

389
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,641
No, ok, I'm sorry. Um...

390
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:47,687
I got one, it's, "I'm having
one heck of a crazy night

391
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:55,779
"But with the k, with the armor,

392
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:58,740
"I don't deserve to be pun-nished."

393
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:03,745
Ha! Ha!
Ha ha ha ha!

394
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,872
You're my new best friend.

395
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,924
Woo!

396
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:47,956
This is fun.

397
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:52,544
Should we just ask each other questions?

398
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:56,131
Who's the best artist here?

399
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,591
Me.

400
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,177
Jinx.

401
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,888
I dig that though, everyone has their own truth.

402
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,764
Let's hear some secrets.

403
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,392
I don't wanna be here.

404
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,435
I want to be at home

405
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:13,398
Watching a dvd with my dad and my mom.

406
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:15,108
Not with a whore.

407
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,610
I have a secret.

408
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,163
I love that you did that.

409
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,123
It felt real to me.

410
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,418
And I love you.

411
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:42,135
So, let's play this game.

412
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,847
Let's be really honest.

413
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,849
I can lie.

414
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,852
Seriously, somebody ask me a question.

415
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,646
Mm, what's your favorite color?

416
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:57,400
Blue.

417
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,528
See? It's purple.

418
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,156
Purple has got a lot of blue in it.

419
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:07,953
Ok. We all know your
favorite food, so what is it?

420
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:12,415
I'm bisexual. I think everyone
in the world probably is.

421
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,794
I make sex with pillow.

422
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,922
Hey, Lexi, Lexi...

423
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:21,299
Do you remember that time
a couple of years ago,

424
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:26,721
When we went and we watched them
detonate the old water towers

425
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,099
From the roof of that factory

426
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:32,852
And we smoked that hash
that tasted like soap?

427
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:37,565
And we had ice-cream bars,
do you remember that, Lexi?

428
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,859
Vaguely.

429
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,737
You went home with that guy named Ganz

430
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,782
To.. stretch out your ear lobes?

431
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:49,786
Oh yeah, the water towers.

432
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:53,456
Well...

433
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:58,336
After you left I picked up
your popsicle stick

434
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,673
From the ice-cream.

435
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:18,898
When I was seven I wrote
a letter to Santa Claus

436
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,567
And asked not to be Jewish.

437
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,403
What do you guys say about me?

438
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,949
You know when I'm not around?

439
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,869
We mostly talk about her.

440
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:35,248
We're kicking you out of the collective.

441
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,126
That's just because you are really talented

442
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,962
And we are insecure.

443
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,298
I hate that.

444
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:48,178
Now when I go to a good movie
or a great exhibit...

445
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,263
I hate it.

446
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:54,976
I just want everything to be bad
because when something is good

447
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,229
There is no room for me.

448
00:39:57,354 --> 00:39:59,480
I used to love art,
now I just hate it.

449
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,440
I want it to suck.

450
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,734
You guys suck.

451
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:07,446
You guys know how you love somebody?

452
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,909
Do you who that person is,
It's...

453
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:14,037
If your afraid to f..
I'm afraid to fly...

454
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:15,580
When you are on the plane

455
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:19,251
And you are worried
that it's going to crash.

456
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:26,007
Person you're thinking about
right then that's who you love.

457
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,927
We do a lot of drugs.

458
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:32,347
What's it like to be a drug dealer?

459
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,640
Feels good.

460
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:37,977
Better than selling perogies.

461
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:41,356
But have to deal with niggers.

462
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,609
See I hate you right now
because you are a racist asshole

463
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:47,404
But, I'm fascinated
with the word "Nigger".

464
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:50,115
Oh-oh.
It has caused so much damage.

465
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,410
It's the most powerful
word in the united states.

466
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,994
Let's talk about something else.

467
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,247
See what I mean how
uncomfortable the word made you?

468
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,374
And you have a confederate belt buckle.

469
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,751
This is a wallet.

470
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:05,880
I hate white people.

471
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:08,049
Alright, let's wrap this up.

472
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,508
Alexander,

473
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:13,179
Do you really have $300,000
in grant money?

474
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:17,225
No.

475
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:20,561
It's more like half a million.

476
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,730
I dumped myself.

477
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,608
Ew.
Goddamn it.

478
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,693
Yes, in..
At my cousin's wedding.

479
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,988
I was running late
and got stuck in the elevator

480
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,656
And I was there for half an hour

481
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:35,034
And I took a dump right in my pants

482
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,787
And then the elevator went down to the lobby

483
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,832
And there's...all filled with
people from model airplane convention

484
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:46,212
And I had to walk up six flights
of stairs and it touched my socks.

485
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:49,090
You are a lame brain man.

486
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,883
I was the groomsman.

487
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,927
Hey, what's your favorite record?

488
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,346
"The Big Chill" soundtrack.

489
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:56,681
Are you gay?
No.

490
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:58,308
Are you a virgin?
No.

491
00:41:58,433 --> 00:41:59,725
What do you do?

492
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,811
I work for the NYPD.
You're a fucking cop?

493
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:02,979
Did you frisk him?

494
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,522
No goddamn way he's a cop.

495
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,025
You guys cuss too much,
but it's ok.

496
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,028
And no, I work for the parking
enforcement district.

497
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:14,782
It's a civilian branch of NYPD,
I'm a level 1 T.E.A.

498
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,868
I make $26,500 a year

499
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:21,080
And all I do is write tickets
and ruin people's days.

500
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:24,376
If I were to die the world would
be fine and no one would miss me

501
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:26,169
And I didn't even tell anyone

502
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:29,088
I was coming to the "Murder Party".

503
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,134
Let's do coke.

504
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,906
Aaaw!

505
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:24,829
Oh, William, it's fabulous.

506
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:27,582
Will you do me a favor
and go check on Hell Hammer.

507
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:31,294
I wouldn't want any stray
bitches to answer his call.

508
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,587
Here I go.

509
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:34,297
Speak of the Devil.

510
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,432
So what do you guys really think?

511
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:12,835
Did you piss in your pants?

512
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:15,505
Eh-eh.

513
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:20,343
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

514
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:30,144
Ok.

515
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:43,241
I hate you.

516
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:50,248
I hate you stupid, stupid worthless dummy.

517
00:45:50,373 --> 00:45:53,167
I hate you so much.

518
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,711
I kill the fuzzy ones.

519
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,962
The word banal comes to mind.

520
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:59,465
It's pretty literal interpretation.
Yeah.

521
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:02,843
I find it... Jejune.

522
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,179
Oh, good word.

523
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:08,015
Now, at least we know
what a visual representation

524
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,852
Of a dial tone looks like.

525
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:14,021
It's a lesion.

526
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,608
It's a whore monger.

527
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:20,361
It's like a screaming barnacle.

528
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,071
Oh, it makes me wanna weep.

529
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,623
Oh, hey, Bill, how's the dog?

530
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:34,875
The dog is fine.

531
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,837
Should we get on with the murder?

532
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,298
Agreed.

533
00:46:55,605 --> 00:47:00,318
Hey, Cycho, come here for a second.
I gotta talk to you.

534
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,403
Hey, look man, let's do some crank.

535
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:03,780
What crank?

536
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,449
Just Barbiturates, you never say crank.

537
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:08,534
I know, but I'm saying it now.

538
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,746
Look, if we are going to do this
I'm gonna need some crank.

539
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,081
I have a gram of coke.

540
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,416
This is not enough.

541
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,918
I want you to go get a big bag of crank

542
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,420
And I'll stall these guys.

543
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,005
I stop for fish and chips?

544
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:25,176
No, but I'll treat afterwards.

545
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,607
Everyone.

546
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:43,110
The Witching Hour is almost upon us.

547
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,697
But before we commit our ritual murder

548
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:47,031
I'm going to recite

549
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:48,783
Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven"

550
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:51,994
In its entirety.

551
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:56,499
"Once upon a midnight dreary
as I pondered weak and weary,

552
00:47:56,624 --> 00:48:01,086
"Over many a quaint and curious
volume of forgotten lore,

553
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,255
"As I nodded nearly napping

554
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,216
"Suddenly there came a tapping

555
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:09,846
"As if someone gently rapping,
rapping at my chamber door.

556
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:14,392
"'Tis some visitor I'm...

557
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:16,686
Hello!
Mmh!

558
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:20,690
Hello!
Ssshhh.

559
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,024
Hello!

560
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,664
It's going to be great.

561
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:40,501
Ah, go ahead and set up over
There by our subject, alright?

562
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,628
Sure.

563
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,715
What?

564
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,719
I never work without an assistant.

565
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,554
Ah, key light, we can put that right here.

566
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:53,681
Get up!
Oh.

567
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:55,725
We need to compensate
for the fluorescent lights.

568
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,602
Personally, not a really
big fan of the whole

569
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,978
"Played out Euro trash, David
Fincher" green lighting thing.

570
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,773
Paul?
Hate it. Great.

571
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:04,941
What are you thinking?

572
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,694
What are you thinking, Paul?

573
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,362
I don't think you guys want to
know what I'm thinking.

574
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,364
I think I do I.

575
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,910
I think I'm sick of people
bitching and moaning in a room.

576
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:17,246
I'm going outside to smoke,
this is no joke.

577
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,539
Fuck you.

578
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,082
I just want to accomplish something.

579
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,584
Alright, something more
than.. than a stabbing.

580
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,795
Don't say stabbing in front of him.

581
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,214
Stab, stab, stab, stab.
It's a private party, Paul.

582
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,591
She wasn't invited.

583
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,847
Hm... Halloween.

584
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:38,142
Hell Hammer. Ha ha.

585
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:45,023
Hey, buddy, wish I was a dog.

586
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:47,944
Yah, booo.

587
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:54,074
Buddy, I'm gonna tell you something

588
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:58,329
I've never told anybody.

589
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:08,339
Every time I try to take a photograph...

590
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:11,007
I just... I don't know if I like
this, it's very complicated.

591
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:14,010
You ruin everything we've set up, Paul.

592
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,180
The night isn't over, Paul.

593
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:18,014
You have no idea what I have planned.

594
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,351
Well, I don't really feel
like I've ruined anything.

595
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,561
Alright, I brought her here
to help me with the portrait.

596
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:24,104
She'll be out of here
as soon as that's done.

597
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,773
Long before midnight.

598
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:28,400
I just wanna to get one
freaking photo, can I do that?

599
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,987
It doesn't sound like
Paul wants a grant to me.

600
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,738
What grant?

601
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,907
You've been telling us about
this grant for three months.

602
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,826
Mean, we've submitted art work
to you? What are you?

603
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,577
You want me to fill out an
application? 'Cause I'll do it.

604
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:41,121
I'm waiting and I'm sorry
I don't mean to be rude

605
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,165
But I haven't seen your renown art work

606
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,584
That everybody supposedly is talking about.

607
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,920
Have you?

608
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:52,341
Have you, Bill?
I wonder why that is...

609
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,302
Run, run now.
It's cool, don't worry about it.

610
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,763
This sort of thing happens on every set.

611
00:50:57,889 --> 00:51:00,056
And what's with that,
your little sketch book,

612
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,350
What's in there?

613
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,143
You're crossing a line, Paul.

614
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:06,689
I will shut up as soon as you
show me what's in that book.

615
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:14,363
Will you be a dear and
go fetch Hell Hammer?

616
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:19,117
Ooh, aah!

617
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:21,077
Macon is on fire!

618
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,997
I drive an Aston Martin.

619
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,373
How come you never invited any of us

620
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:25,833
To your house in the Hamptons, huh?

621
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,501
It's really not your scene.

622
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:28,878
What about your cell phone,

623
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:30,504
Why has it got a New Jersey area code?

624
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,423
I happen to do a lot
of business in New Jersey.

625
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:34,800
Why do we always pay for your dinner?

626
00:51:34,926 --> 00:51:37,302
What about Coney Island, Paul?

627
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,805
Those were hotdogs.

628
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:45,978
Oh, oh!
Oh, oh!

629
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,022
...We shot the freak...

630
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,607
We all shot the freak,

631
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:50,816
But I was the one who got...

632
00:51:50,942 --> 00:51:52,068
Come with me, go that way.

633
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,278
...When you handed me your beer.

634
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:55,696
You took the cannon ball.

635
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:59,033
Well I'm not talking it any...

636
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,660
Do a sketch, just produce something

637
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:05,581
That proves you an iota,
An iota of artistic talent

638
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:09,877
Help me. Help me.

639
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:13,171
Something avant-garde,
something cutting edge.

640
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:15,382
You pissed it all away.
You squandered everything,

641
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,759
You made fools of us.

642
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:19,511
You made a fool of me, Alexander.

643
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:22,807
I answer to no one and I commit art at will.

644
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:26,102
You walked in here with Euro
trash, make us do Barbiturates.

645
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,604
You disrespect my artistic
process, you son of a bitch.

646
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:30,188
You're a fraud.

647
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:35,360
No, no you're worse than
a fraud, you're an imposter!

648
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:36,695
Shut up, Hell Hammer,

649
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:39,197
Or I'll send you to the glue factory.

650
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,662
What you got over here?

651
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:53,378
Urgh!

652
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,171
That was an accident.

653
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,929
Hm, two down, three to go.

654
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:03,681
What the fuck are you doing?

655
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:06,475
Alexander, you're full of shit.

656
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,935
I'm a fry cook.

657
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,354
See, what did I tell you?

658
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:12,064
I let you fuck me.

659
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,236
Jejune.

660
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:21,406
"Jejune"? What, do you write
stuff down and say to us later?

661
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:22,658
Yeah.

662
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,200
That's pathetic.

663
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:28,831
I don't understand so
there's no grant, no gallery?

664
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,541
Where are my photographs?

665
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:33,544
They're at my grandmother's
house in New Jersey.

666
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:34,712
Um, I'm gonna go now.

667
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:36,797
Yeah.
No, hang on a second.

668
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,883
So, what are you doing with our art?

669
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:43,137
Well, I'm gonna kill you
all and then I'm gonna sell it.

670
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:45,430
Art isn't worth
anything until you're dead.

671
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,183
So you do like our art.

672
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,021
No, I'm--I'm really gonna leave.

673
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:55,733
Yeah, we all are.
Just wanna take a picture first.

674
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:58,777
Alexander, I hate you.

675
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:01,697
Is that even your real name?
No, it's Tim.

676
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,323
What's his real name?

677
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,742
Oh, it's Hell Hammer.

678
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:07,369
I'm going to put
him to sleep on monday.

679
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,038
Why, what's wrong with him?

680
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:12,917
He's not cute,
I only like puppies.

681
00:54:13,042 --> 00:54:14,001
It's a two-eight.

682
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:16,212
Good, alright, all set.

683
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:24,762
Oh, hey, dude, shoot Paul in the face.

684
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:26,805
Paul!
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

685
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:30,475
Aaah!

686
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:32,853
Unbelievable!

687
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,814
Shoot him, shoot all of them.

688
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,195
(Turkish)

689
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:46,158
Unbelievable.
Would you just let me finish?

690
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:47,785
Just wait, wait!

691
00:54:57,086 --> 00:55:01,381
Look at your stupid shoes.

692
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,175
Stupid shoes.

693
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:30,702
Aaaah!

694
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:44,925
Where's my crank?

695
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,342
Where's my crank?

696
00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:11,535
Aaaahhhh!

697
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:14,370
Everybody dies.

698
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:05,172
Everybody dies!

699
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:18,310
Everybody dies, Timmy.

700
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,980
Everybody dies!

701
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:41,333
Taxi, taxi, taxi!

702
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:48,673
Timmy, oh, Timmy, oh, Timmy, oh, Timmy!

703
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:59,476
Aaah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

704
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:10,154
Ah, what's wrong with you?

705
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:11,863
What the fuck is wrong with you?

706
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:20,372
Die, die!

707
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:26,170
Ah! Party's over!

708
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:20,891
Where are you?
You fuck!

709
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:23,519
Come and get it!
Get your..

710
00:59:31,902 --> 00:59:35,072
Oh, I see, I see you.

711
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:38,450
Come and get it.
Come and get it.

712
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:55,509
You're going to die,
You're going to die.

713
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:22,072
It's your death time.

714
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,655
Help!

715
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,617
Help! He's a murderer!

716
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:11,580
He's threatening me.
What an asshole.

717
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:13,331
Give me your cell phone!

718
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:16,501
I need a phone!
Call 911!

719
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,727
Can I get a pink panty dropper.

720
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:48,301
Aaahh! Aaahhhh!

721
01:04:56,934 --> 01:05:00,397
Call 911, call 911, call 911.

722
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,275
Wait, are you with the show?

723
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:34,431
Sorry, I'll just be a minute.

724
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,391
I'm trying to hide.
Does anyone have a cell phone?

725
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:42,397
Bill?

726
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:43,690
William?

727
01:05:43,815 --> 01:05:45,024
Cicero.

728
01:05:45,149 --> 01:05:46,693
What's up?

729
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:49,696
I can dig it.

730
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:52,574
Well?
It's a cool party.

731
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:56,119
Really, they are letting people in?

732
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:58,872
Jared, lock it up because
The show hasn't started yet,

733
01:05:58,996 --> 01:05:59,997
You dildos.

734
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:01,792
Welcome, so how's it going?

735
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:03,501
Finally an artiste,

736
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:05,545
Are you here for the bus people show?

737
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,464
You know what we should get you a show.

738
01:06:07,589 --> 01:06:11,718
You should have your own show,
Bill. Let me get you a drink.

739
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:14,220
Mr. Marson always loved
your murals in synergy group.

740
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,640
He really did.
Thanks.

741
01:06:16,765 --> 01:06:19,309
Hey, is Alexander coming to the party?

742
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:22,019
I've been talking
to him about getting a grant.

743
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:25,690
Let me get you a drink.
I'll be right back.

744
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:31,988
Fuck this whole scene.
Everybody dies.

745
01:06:37,953 --> 01:06:39,245
Oh!

746
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,539
Will have to fight him
or he'll kill us.

747
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:44,793
I'm a lover not a fighter.

748
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:48,129
Argh!
Everybody's gonna die.

749
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:52,467
I'm going to kill everybody.
Right here.

750
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:55,804
Why are you doing this?!

751
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:03,227
Stop it! Stop it!

752
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,732
Fuck it!

753
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:11,444
Aaaah!

754
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:13,404
Why are you doing this?

755
01:07:18,827 --> 01:07:23,414
Oh, god, they started without us.

756
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:26,543
Jared, we are on.
Open the fucking doors.

757
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:36,970
Wow.

758
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:39,014
Jesus Christ.

759
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:45,269
He killed Lexi!

760
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,818
Oh, oh.

761
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:08,626
Stop killing everybody!

762
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:15,132
Everybody dies.

763
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:28,688
Aah! Aah!

764
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,273
Lexi!

765
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,152
Ooh.

766
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,224
You just ruined the party!

767
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:17,881
Yes, still life as performance art.

768
01:10:18,006 --> 01:10:20,341
It's their best work yet.

769
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:26,139
It's real.

770
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:21,545
Good morning.

771
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:23,941
Sir Lancelot, please get down.

772
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:38,748
