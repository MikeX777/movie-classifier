1
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:26,725
That is our Planet.
From distance it is like the usual school globe.

2
00:01:29,212 --> 00:01:30,583
Let's look through clouds.

3
00:01:31,312 --> 00:01:36,395
But let's not ask earthmen about this city's name
and the title of this scientific centre --

4
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,838
on the shore of warm blue sea.

5
00:01:48,613 --> 00:01:55,390
Fishermen and poets, schoolboys and academicians,
astronomers and cosmonauts live here.

6
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,291
It's Sunday today,
and everyone is spending it in his own way.

7
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:05,099
This is the operator of the computer centre - Paul.

8
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:10,171
He is a joker and chess player.
Never failed in playing chess to his friend Andrey.

9
00:02:10,947 --> 00:02:18,087
Andrey - specialises in sky mechanics.
Writes songs and dreams of remote stars.

10
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,026
He believes stars are populated.

11
00:02:22,457 --> 00:02:29,736
Ivan Batalov. Engineer and amateur painter.
He draws cartoons of friends in his album.

12
00:02:33,744 --> 00:02:38,953
This restrained man of few words
is nicknamed Commander by his friends.

13
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:47,521
Academician Krylov. Head astronomer,
compiler of star atlas.

14
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:52,905
He meets today his foreign colleague -
Dr. Laungton

15
00:02:54,495 --> 00:03:01,672
They have an old dispute - what kind of event will be
probable upon the meeting of Earth and space aliens.

16
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:09,623
I. S. Shklovsky
The Universe. The Life. The Mind.

17
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:14,031
Tanya. Radio-astronomer.

18
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:18,967
She listens to mysterious voices of far stars.

19
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:25,711
Today she's recorded strange,
unusual signals from space.

20
00:03:26,672 --> 00:03:31,441
What if these ones are exactly those signals
which The Earth been waiting for many years?

21
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,981
Hurry up to Andrey.

22
00:03:35,262 --> 00:03:40,327
- Give me your hand.
- Stop laughing, Andrey, I'm serious.

23
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:44,259
What if it's really the signals
coming from another world?

24
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,032
Look out, Tanya.

25
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,652
Have you really never thought about it?

26
00:03:49,002 --> 00:03:50,250
Never thought about it.

27
00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:52,122
Never thought?

28
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:02,221
And what is that device
which you demonstrated to Paul?

29
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:05,876
Device? It's a typical crystalphone.

30
00:04:07,844 --> 00:04:08,884
Show me?

31
00:04:09,631 --> 00:04:12,488
Nothing interesting.
Just dreams in spare time.

32
00:04:15,511 --> 00:04:16,719
Well.

33
00:04:17,726 --> 00:04:19,823
I will not ask you anymore.

34
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:26,606
Are you serious?

35
00:04:28,822 --> 00:04:31,000
OK, here you are, listen to it.

36
00:04:54,230 --> 00:05:08,854
Living and believing is wonderful.
We have unprecedented voyages in the future.

37
00:05:09,438 --> 00:05:22,398
Cosmonauts and dreamers say
that apple trees will be in flower on Mars.

38
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:53,190
That's good when your friends are with you.
It's easier to come across the whole Universe.

39
00:05:54,142 --> 00:06:07,678
Stars will meet the Earth in flower,
And apple trees will be in flower on Mars.

40
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:15,306
Overcoming endless space distances,
the Earth song has reached the planet Centuria,

41
00:06:16,921 --> 00:06:20,225
and the greatest and most beautiful event
in the Universe happened --

42
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,895
people of one planet have heard
a voice of another planet.

43
00:06:25,457 --> 00:06:38,690
I became a friend of far stars,
don't worry about me and don't be sad.

44
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:54,248
While leaving the Earth we promised
that apple trees would be in flower on Mars.

45
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:15,690
But what kind of feeling the Earth song
has evoked in their hearts?

46
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:18,171
Fear or joy?

47
00:07:19,383 --> 00:07:23,983
And what if they are to give the Earth a challenge?
That's what Dr. Laungton thinks of.

48
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:25,780
Hostile challenge.

49
00:07:26,436 --> 00:07:31,661
No. Such a way of thinking is only for a man
who doesn't believe in the power of mind.

50
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:48,299
Scientists of the planet Centuria have known
that the Earth is populated

51
00:07:48,854 --> 00:07:52,414
And they decided to fly, only fly.

52
00:09:07,742 --> 00:09:11,757
But people of Earth didn't expect
guests from the Universe.

53
00:09:12,917 --> 00:09:19,037
- I flew to the Moon, and you will fly to Mars
- There's lack of water on Mars. No cocktails at all.

54
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,915
Especially for you, gourmet, pikes
will be bred in Mars puddles.

55
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:26,916
You're completely right.

56
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:38,832
- Only in the case if crucian carps will be there.
- Crucian carps? What are you talking about?

57
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:45,511
Attention! All the cosmonauts except those who are
under observation in thermo chambers and isolation chambers,

58
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,915
please get together on the Gagarin Square.

59
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:20,148
Attention! All the cosmonauts except those who are
under observation in thermo chambers and isolation chambers,

60
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:23,338
please get together on the Gagarin Square.

61
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:50,338
- So Ivan, we will fly?
- Possibly, but our routes could be different.

62
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:52,544
Come along.

63
00:10:53,057 --> 00:10:59,969
Like in the song: The order is given -
he should move to Phobos,
she should move in the opposite direction.

64
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:02,186
Sergey Petrovich arrived,

65
00:11:07,593 --> 00:11:12,753
They will send together only newly
married couple. Think about it.

66
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:28,257
My friends, I am glad to inform you about an alarming and
at the same time, remarkable piece of news.

67
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:37,695
We've just received structured signals from space.
This means that the hypothesis of progressive scientists are confirmed.

68
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:40,424
Sergey Petrovich, it is probably an accidental coincidence?

69
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:44,847
No, my friends, the signals are being progressively increased.

70
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:52,749
As for now, decoding machines are
unsuccessfully trying to decipher this
enigmatic symphony of radiation,

71
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,901
The Eyes and Ears of the Earth
are focused on the supposed source of the signal.

72
00:12:19,556 --> 00:12:27,951
This is information from the International Cosmo Centre.
At 17:18 MSK, satellite observatories have noticed again --

73
00:12:27,953 --> 00:12:32,750
an unidentified spaceship. It's crossed the Moon's
orbit and is moving towards the Earth.

74
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:36,288
Our electronic machines are calculating
the possible landing place.

75
00:12:47,973 --> 00:12:52,821
But why are the signals interrupted now?
This really is a puzzle...

76
00:12:55,745 --> 00:12:57,143
We just should solve it.

77
00:13:04,431 --> 00:13:12,575
Incomprehensible.
It all looks like some fantastic fiction...

78
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:28,574
So the excited Earth was awaiting the
crossing of its orbit with the orbit of aliens.

79
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:35,391
What will happen?
A giant explosion which will burn all life on Earth, --

80
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:42,200
- - or the Earth with the addition of the aliens' mind
will be in blossom, become more beautiful, --

81
00:13:42,205 --> 00:13:45,811
will become the planet of
the Companionship of Suns?

82
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:20,467
But to the earthmen's astonishment, only a little star
has fallen to the sea, leaving there a strange object.

83
00:14:21,202 --> 00:14:26,115
So what has this amazing delegate
from space brought to the Earth?

84
00:14:33,178 --> 00:14:35,586
Pyotr Timofeyevich, what happened?

85
00:14:35,587 --> 00:14:39,459
It's their ship's video log-book.
The Starship's cabin is clearly seen.

86
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:41,822
Call Krylov to me.

87
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:52,181
Play it.

88
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:23,184
They were flying to us.
But why?

89
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:37,766
I suppose that a civilisation capable of overcoming
interstellar distances could have only one purpose -

90
00:16:38,402 --> 00:16:39,930
thirst for knowledge.

91
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:44,010
- Are you sure?

92
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:49,431
Thirst for knowledge pushed civilised Europeans on
to an unknown Asia and Africa.

93
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:58,229
This all brought to us a sea of tears and blood.
This was done by people living under one sky.

94
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,265
What we can expect from meeting with another world?

95
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,336
This could be a wonderful meeting.

96
00:17:05,344 --> 00:17:07,632
This meeting could be unpleasant.

97
00:17:09,064 --> 00:17:14,408
Sergey Petrovich, we are receiving
a lot of requests from different countries.

98
00:17:18,544 --> 00:17:21,151
I suppose, Sergey Petrovich, we should call the Congress.

99
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:26,384
Yes, a lot of difficulties,
almost unresolvable tasks --

100
00:17:28,317 --> 00:17:33,340
So, should we publish a report about our inability
to solve this, and break up with disgrace?

101
00:17:34,315 --> 00:17:35,811
No, ladies and gentlemen.

102
00:17:36,115 --> 00:17:40,315
Now, when we've faced real opportunities of
establishing friendship between different worlds, --

103
00:17:40,905 --> 00:17:44,313
when residents of other planets
have taken the first step in doing this --

104
00:17:44,618 --> 00:17:46,969
we ought to make a step in answer.

105
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:49,520
Even if they didn't ask our help.

106
00:17:50,663 --> 00:17:54,280
I don't believe in the risk of this meeting,
the risk is hidden in another thing --

107
00:17:54,726 --> 00:17:57,854
the risk that we are too late to help.

108
00:17:58,982 --> 00:18:01,358
Mr. Laungton, you're welcome.

109
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:22,590
Dear colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.

110
00:18:23,378 --> 00:18:26,321
I have listened with astonishment to
this very interesting --

111
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:32,265
but absolutely fantastic
speech from president Krylov.

112
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:39,969
What the respected president said is
romantic and beautiful, but impossible.

113
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:44,543
Our mechanical spies have
reached Mars and Venera.

114
00:18:45,264 --> 00:18:48,331
It is obviously that neighbouring
planets civilisations --

115
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,074
interpret this as an attempt
to conquer circumsolar space.

116
00:18:52,726 --> 00:18:57,052
I accentuate, dear colleagues,
that I would be happy if I'm wrong.

117
00:18:57,556 --> 00:19:00,234
These are thoughts of not a scientist
but a politician from the past.

118
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:03,476
Not a scientist?

119
00:19:05,026 --> 00:19:09,415
Perhaps, but a human who wish to
defend his home --

120
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,681
which also appears as your home too.

121
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:18,353
And at least, whom will you send
to meet suspense, to the foreign planet?

122
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:20,406
People who love their planet.

123
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:25,532
And these are thoughts of
a dreamer, not a scientist.

124
00:19:26,077 --> 00:19:29,251
For doing this we need to make a jump over
centuries of technological progress.

125
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:33,742
Why not try? We could unite
the intelligence and science of our planet,

126
00:19:34,116 --> 00:19:35,570
gather all the needed things together.

127
00:19:35,906 --> 00:19:41,223
And money, Mr. Laungton... Who can
believe that our powerful planet --

128
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,187
which recently spent billions
for militarization, can not...

129
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:50,797
- Fly. We should fly.
- Right

130
00:19:51,517 --> 00:19:55,219
He's right, Mr. Laungton,
we cosmonauts are ready to fly to Mars.

131
00:19:57,546 --> 00:20:01,410
Crashed in the area of Mars,
cosmonauts of Centuria --

132
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:08,357
transmitted SOS signals not to
Russians or Americans, Frenchmen or Arabians.

133
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:13,003
They addressed it to the
whole our planet, its collective mind.

134
00:20:14,072 --> 00:20:16,734
Comrades, friends, ladies and gentlemen

135
00:20:17,538 --> 00:20:22,925
Spaceship OCEAN made by
the nations of our country --

136
00:20:22,926 --> 00:20:25,574
was to be launched
in half a year --

137
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:28,589
when an advantageous
arrangement of planets will occur.

138
00:20:29,657 --> 00:20:31,166
But the situation is now changed, --

139
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:34,934
and we ought to fly immediately
and with maximum speed.

140
00:20:35,453 --> 00:20:38,069
But this is impossible without
the express delivering of --

141
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:40,980
a huge amount of energetic
resources to the Moon.

142
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:49,443
And despite difference of opinions,
people of Earth decided to fly.

143
00:20:50,027 --> 00:20:56,272
Tens of shuttles flew to the Moon to deliver
energy for supporting spaceship OCEAN -

144
00:20:56,827 --> 00:20:59,060
which is ready to fly to Mars.

145
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:19,370
We are leaving our home planet
to spread our Earth truth.

146
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:26,729
Through stars and planets,
Flying faster than light.

147
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:34,758
For making it possible for Earth to sound
everywhere with a long-expected signal.

148
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:43,981
I am Earth, I will never forget my children,
sons and daughters

149
00:21:44,498 --> 00:21:51,555
Fly to the Sun
and hurry to come back home.

150
00:21:52,595 --> 00:21:59,745
We will fly to the Sun
and will hurry to come back home.

151
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:07,311
Our purposes are high and distant
Our ancestors who helped the Earth to be beautiful

152
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:15,333
are with us on our star way.

153
00:22:15,797 --> 00:22:23,299
So let the commander's order and mother's
instructions sound for us and them.

154
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:32,762
I am Earth, I will never forget my children,
sons and daughters

155
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:40,392
Fly to the Sun
and hurry to come back home.

156
00:22:40,815 --> 00:22:49,989
We will fly to the Sun
and will hurry to come back home.

157
00:23:00,163 --> 00:23:02,411
So what about Mars' behaviour?

158
00:23:05,346 --> 00:23:10,250
- Silent, no life signs.
- So we should be looking for?

159
00:23:17,454 --> 00:23:24,924
No life signs.

160
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:28,900
Nothing.

161
00:23:59,074 --> 00:24:04,611
Attention! The Earth calls for
commander of cargo spaceship RDU-12.

162
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:42,593
- Lusya, when?
- The Earth channel is busy.

163
00:24:44,664 --> 00:24:46,463
- My orders?
- Later.

164
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:56,784
Lusenka, Lake of Dreams please.

165
00:24:57,655 --> 00:24:59,672
Don't waste your time.

166
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:08,273
My apologies, I am new here on the Moon.
Santos Rem, journalist.

167
00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:10,233
I ask you, please.

168
00:25:10,614 --> 00:25:12,445
Unfortunately, all channels
are busy right now, Mr. Rem.

169
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:14,051
Predictable.

170
00:25:17,607 --> 00:25:18,847
I'll wait.

171
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:33,479
The weather on Earth
was beautiful yesterday.

172
00:25:39,094 --> 00:25:42,190
You like it?
That's for you.

173
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:45,708
How beautiful.

174
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:54,105
That's all very well, but what
is the result of flight Mars-3?

175
00:25:54,332 --> 00:25:56,021
Are your suppositions confirmed?

176
00:25:57,068 --> 00:25:59,083
Yes, they are confirmed.

177
00:25:59,492 --> 00:26:03,634
But lots of aspects are still unclear,
and surprises are possible at every step.

178
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,400
But we can't wait anymore.

179
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,615
Even during minutes of great events,
there's always a cluster of people --

180
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:14,046
for whom a loud report of an event
is more important than the event itself.

181
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:18,400
They are always ready to
rush to the middle of event, --

182
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,499
and nobody knows
the question they'll ask again.

183
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,840
Why are you flying to Mars?

184
00:26:27,232 --> 00:26:28,953
It's worth it to fly to.

185
00:26:30,243 --> 00:26:31,348
Ivan, what happened?

186
00:26:31,947 --> 00:26:36,122
By the way, it's Commander,
he could help your newspaper.

187
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:37,725
I am at your service.

188
00:26:43,654 --> 00:26:48,446
Excuse me, I have...
Mr. Commander, that's for my newspaper.

189
00:26:50,148 --> 00:26:52,138
What are you flying to Mars for?

190
00:26:55,058 --> 00:26:58,243
What for? To return to the Earth.

191
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,714
- And bring smiles from a different world.

192
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:16,585
Yes, but only two of you, and we
know that three of you should fly.

193
00:27:18,456 --> 00:27:19,951
So, who's the third one?

194
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:34,952
Like a drummer friend said:
"One more beat and the music is over".

195
00:27:39,845 --> 00:27:41,797
Tanyusha, come in.

196
00:27:46,493 --> 00:27:49,429
If you're interested
in orbital flights...

197
00:27:50,393 --> 00:27:55,512
I want... I want to say
happy birthday to you.

198
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,908
Because... You know... I...

199
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,800
I know. Because "the order is given -
he should move to Phobos... "

200
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:39,022
Report about readiness.

201
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:56,308
"We have passed 75 million km. Mars in sizes is
like a dish from here. What if we... "

202
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:10,122
Is it lunch already?

203
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:43,362
Even far away from the Earth, people
will still have their usual earth habits.

204
00:30:43,896 --> 00:30:48,352
They will miss home lunch,
green fields,

205
00:30:49,155 --> 00:30:51,236
will joke and argue.

206
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:58,811
The temperament of the people in the
spaceship will obviously weigh the same
value as on the Earth.

207
00:31:02,635 --> 00:31:03,971
Let's play?

208
00:31:06,035 --> 00:31:08,651
I am finishing reading
Moon Diaries by Krylov.

209
00:31:12,265 --> 00:31:13,673
Mars...

210
00:31:15,856 --> 00:31:17,929
How will it meet us?

211
00:31:27,064 --> 00:31:30,577
- Tanyusha.
- Paul, how will we understand each other?

212
00:31:35,817 --> 00:31:41,537
There's a language which
should be understandable.

213
00:31:42,288 --> 00:31:44,792
I am speaking of them.
When will you be serious?

214
00:31:46,262 --> 00:31:48,150
When I will die of
hunger, mademoiselle.

215
00:31:49,673 --> 00:31:53,279
- Don't upset Martian girls,
they are waiting impatiently for you.

216
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:59,635
But before dying of hunger,
I will write a book.

217
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:03,074
A story?
A novel?

218
00:32:03,553 --> 00:32:09,895
I will write a book about
cooking tasty and healthy... space food.

219
00:32:16,485 --> 00:32:17,845
What's that?

220
00:32:20,254 --> 00:32:22,325
"Food for gods and cosmonauts. "

221
00:32:22,436 --> 00:32:29,164
A gift by a French company. Every pill's
nutritional value is like lamb chop.

222
00:32:29,609 --> 00:32:30,633
Let me see.

223
00:32:33,072 --> 00:32:37,113
I know this company, they sell pills
only for those who leave the Earth.

224
00:32:39,704 --> 00:32:40,829
Try it.

225
00:33:14,577 --> 00:33:17,321
- What happened to devices of the 2nd block?
- Look.

226
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:20,984
Sun!

227
00:33:23,928 --> 00:33:25,400
Put your pressure helmets on.

228
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:29,726
An unexpected solar burst
has detuned some important units.

229
00:33:37,211 --> 00:33:38,907
Close your face guards.

230
00:33:43,787 --> 00:33:46,003
I'm switching on units
of the 3rd and 7th blocks.

231
00:33:48,035 --> 00:33:49,259
Maximum protection.

232
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:51,497
All blocks are working.

233
00:33:53,684 --> 00:33:54,435
To the limit.

234
00:33:55,296 --> 00:33:56,438
Calculating stars energy.

235
00:33:56,997 --> 00:33:58,374
To the limit!

236
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,128
In only five Minutes, radio-waves have
delivered Tanya's words to the Moon.

237
00:34:18,254 --> 00:34:24,566
We are trying to stick to Mars' orbit.
Only emergency block are working.

238
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:08,566
Tanya, Tanyusha, move something.
Ringing in the ears?

239
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,959
Weakness...

240
00:35:11,548 --> 00:35:12,756
Connections.

241
00:35:18,505 --> 00:35:21,738
Paul. Cotton with
ammonia spirit.

242
00:35:37,247 --> 00:35:40,600
Am I alive?
Some symphony in my ears...

243
00:35:42,137 --> 00:35:46,193
- The emergency one has done its job.

244
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,415
Switch off the blocks of
UV protection.

245
00:35:52,773 --> 00:35:59,733
Now two tasks: Paul, monitor it,
and I will inspect our energy sources.

246
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,225
- You see?

247
00:36:06,909 --> 00:36:08,234
I swear it is it.

248
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:10,607
Let's check it out.

249
00:36:12,887 --> 00:36:14,020
Starship.

250
00:36:14,658 --> 00:36:18,353
OCEAN crossed the Mars orbit.
Intellect wins.

251
00:36:20,575 --> 00:36:23,709
During a 19th lap around the Mars,
OCEAN crew detected a starship.

252
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,111
Starship discovered.
What will Krylov state?

253
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:31,842
OCEAN lost too much
energy due to a damage.

254
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,407
So landing on Mars is impossible?

255
00:36:33,955 --> 00:36:36,771
Landing is possible, but
taking-off is impossible.

256
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:39,408
So we should speed up
the launching of OCEAN-2.

257
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,469
And what do they suggest?

258
00:36:51,357 --> 00:36:54,650
Mars. A lifeless desert.

259
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,231
Did Mars expect, that here spaceships
of different planets would meet?

260
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:07,161
Shall we go?

261
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:18,302
Spaceship OCEAN transmits.
Watch and listen.

262
00:37:18,706 --> 00:37:22,442
We are broadcasting right from
the place of starship landing.

263
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:42,247
- I will go.
- Wait.

264
00:38:45,376 --> 00:38:46,832
Paul, stay here.

265
00:39:06,437 --> 00:39:08,084
No response.

266
00:39:59,843 --> 00:40:02,819
Some more steps, and Commander
will enter the Starship.

267
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:33,079
The Starship from
a far unknown planet,

268
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:39,773
You've overcome long long
distances, for what?

269
00:40:41,282 --> 00:40:43,225
What have you brought to us?

270
00:40:44,585 --> 00:40:47,146
What mysteries do you
hide in your modules?

271
00:40:48,771 --> 00:40:54,620
We believe in good, so we
meet you with trustfulness.

272
00:40:56,193 --> 00:40:58,938
But Dr. Laungton...

273
00:40:59,811 --> 00:41:01,754
what if he was right?

274
00:41:43,259 --> 00:41:46,232
OCEAN transmits for Earth and Moon:

275
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:51,232
we've found the Starship, there's
one Centuria cosmonaut - he is dead.

276
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:54,584
I repeat - only one dead cosmonaut.

277
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:57,566
"One dead cosmonaut was
found in the Starship. "

278
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,822
"Where's the rest of
the cosmonauts?"

279
00:42:26,018 --> 00:42:27,018
How are things?

280
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,100
I'm trying to find out
where the other two could go.

281
00:42:32,422 --> 00:42:36,582
OCEAN crew supposes
that 2 other cosmonauts of Centuria

282
00:42:37,675 --> 00:42:40,308
escaped the Starship on
an emergency ship during the crash.

283
00:42:42,328 --> 00:42:46,888
We need to launch the satellites
around Mars as fast as possible.

284
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,758
It is the only way to find them,
but OCEAN-2 is not yet ready for launching.

285
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:59,795
But my METEOR is ready. I will take
video satellites and throw them over Mars.

286
00:43:00,727 --> 00:43:01,822
And what next?

287
00:43:02,524 --> 00:43:06,384
You know that METEOR should
move fast, all the energy will be out fast.

288
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,290
You will not be able to come back
to Earth nor to land on Mars.

289
00:43:10,687 --> 00:43:11,782
Lack of energy.

290
00:43:12,118 --> 00:43:14,749
And I am not going to land
on Mars in METEOR.

291
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:21,063
Have a look. After the launching
of satellites around Mars, --

292
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:24,144
I will land on Phobos, leave METEOR -

293
00:43:24,592 --> 00:43:26,822
and will land in
an emergency ship on Mars.

294
00:43:27,922 --> 00:43:29,346
I thought about it.

295
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:33,330
It's a huge risk -
a minor mistake and...

296
00:43:33,396 --> 00:43:37,565
Sergey Petrovich,
risk will be in any case.

297
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:40,590
Me and Andrey have made
all the necessary calculations.

298
00:43:41,939 --> 00:43:44,075
Well, call for Andrey.

299
00:43:51,645 --> 00:43:55,941
So the second spaceship leaves the Moon
and moves forward to Mars, --

300
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:04,986
to launch satellites into the Mars orbit,
they will search for the lost cosmonauts of Centuria.

301
00:44:06,706 --> 00:44:09,641
OCEAN crew was waiting.

302
00:44:28,681 --> 00:44:30,954
Video satellites are working.

303
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,727
Good.

304
00:44:35,687 --> 00:44:38,159
Tanya, it's sharp visibility.

305
00:44:53,562 --> 00:44:56,891
Now we will find them, Paul.

306
00:45:00,061 --> 00:45:06,309
After launching the devices for observation,
having not enough energy to land on Mars,

307
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:11,842
cosmonauts have approached Phobos - Mars satellite,
where the gravitation is far smaller,

308
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,265
and have succeeded in landing.

309
00:45:31,542 --> 00:45:33,302
Communicate with OCEAN

310
00:45:39,134 --> 00:45:41,094
How's Phobos?

311
00:45:42,727 --> 00:45:46,222
It's splendid. Now we are
going to observe it.

312
00:45:47,373 --> 00:45:49,634
It's not necessary. Let's do it later.

313
00:45:49,635 --> 00:45:53,602
Because you could be late for launching,
and thus could stay there for a week.

314
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:59,203
Remember, only 32 minutes left to launch.
We will contact you every 5 minutes.

315
00:45:59,626 --> 00:46:02,520
- In two hours we will be on Mars.
- Hoping for a warm meeting.

316
00:46:08,213 --> 00:46:12,253
Hurry up, we have a wind here,
very strong wind.

317
00:46:12,624 --> 00:46:14,007
Be careful.

318
00:46:14,222 --> 00:46:16,445
I repeat, we contact
you every 5 minutes.

319
00:46:16,924 --> 00:46:18,292
Ivan, what's that shadow?

320
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:35,783
It's Centuria cosmonauts.

321
00:46:41,493 --> 00:46:45,574
We are looking for them on Mars,
but they've landed here on Phobos.

322
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,812
Why do you not respond?

323
00:48:30,758 --> 00:48:34,551
17 minutes left to launch, answer.

324
00:49:05,836 --> 00:49:09,212
OCEAN listens to you, why no response?
What happened?

325
00:49:09,537 --> 00:49:10,889
Tanya, give me Vassily, please

326
00:49:12,497 --> 00:49:13,561
It's me.

327
00:49:13,788 --> 00:49:16,260
Listen, they are on Phobos.

328
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:16,896
Who are "they"?

329
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:18,926
Cosmonauts from Centuria.

330
00:49:19,588 --> 00:49:24,587
One of them is alive. Here are three
of us now, and the ship takes only two.

331
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,497
You understand?

332
00:49:26,334 --> 00:49:29,212
Someone must stay on Phobos.

333
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,847
- Is there any possibility?
- Only to wait.

334
00:49:34,709 --> 00:49:35,651
To wait?

335
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:47,572
How long to wait?

336
00:49:54,641 --> 00:49:59,409
Why can't you decide, Ivan?
I must stay here.

337
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,160
You know it, I've never controlled
an emergency ship with so much loading.

338
00:50:09,529 --> 00:50:11,480
We have no choice

339
00:50:11,863 --> 00:50:15,825
It's not just the cosmonaut.
Think what you're risking.

340
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:17,904
A human from another planet.

341
00:50:18,941 --> 00:50:20,269
Don't persist, Ivan.

342
00:50:22,245 --> 00:50:24,174
If we'll be late for launching,
we all die.

343
00:50:26,191 --> 00:50:28,702
Don't persist, Vanya.

344
00:51:01,532 --> 00:51:04,364
Emergency ship,
where are you?

345
00:51:04,849 --> 00:51:06,503
We can't see you.

346
00:51:07,222 --> 00:51:12,860
Keep in mind - there's a storm,
dust-storm the whole way up to the equator.

347
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,440
Yes. To the equator.

348
00:51:25,265 --> 00:51:27,273
Emergency ship.

349
00:51:28,094 --> 00:51:30,582
I am emergency ship,
I'm going to land.

350
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:38,022
Your coordinates please, repeat.
Once again, repeat.

351
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:43,465
I am landing in the area of Starship.

352
00:52:42,402 --> 00:52:48,041
Emergency ship, I am OCEAN,
please answer.

353
00:52:55,334 --> 00:52:58,951
Contact with Emergency ship
could be not resumed.

354
00:52:59,029 --> 00:53:00,588
We can't waste time.

355
00:53:25,282 --> 00:53:31,499
I am Batalov, we've
landed in the area of the Starship.

356
00:53:32,469 --> 00:53:36,190
The emergency ship has exploded.
Turn on radio beacon.

357
00:53:36,842 --> 00:53:41,561
Turning on radio beacon.

358
00:53:41,863 --> 00:53:47,015
Space maps, navigator is defining the
further route more exactly for the last time.

359
00:53:47,526 --> 00:53:55,165
Guys, let's sing a song before launching,
We have 14 minutes.

360
00:53:55,551 --> 00:54:03,534
My friends, I believe caravans of spaceships
will deliver us from a star to another star.

361
00:54:03,975 --> 00:54:10,942
Our footprints will be left on
dusty paths of distant planets.

362
00:54:21,377 --> 00:54:27,793
OCEAN, I'm Batalov, have
landed in the area of the Starship.

363
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:35,519
Andrey, answer. What happened?

364
00:56:12,042 --> 00:56:25,177
Living and believing is wonderful.
We have unprecedented voyages in the future.

365
00:56:25,754 --> 00:56:37,994
Cosmonauts and dreamers say
that apple trees will be in flower on Mars.

366
00:56:52,778 --> 00:57:04,946
I became a friend of far stars,
Don't worry about me and don't be sad.

367
00:57:54,073 --> 00:57:57,674
Tanyusha, I hear you.

368
00:57:58,366 --> 00:58:01,719
Andrey, so why did you not answer?
Why?

369
00:58:02,935 --> 00:58:09,032
I thought about the Earth,
about you.

370
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:14,576
I wrote that song for you.

371
00:58:17,257 --> 00:58:18,801
Do you remember it?

372
00:58:18,983 --> 00:58:28,884
All that I have done on the Earth, Tanya,
and what I planned to do...

373
00:58:32,996 --> 00:58:41,260
No, don't say that. I don't want those last wills.
Don't you dare say that.

374
00:58:42,621 --> 00:58:46,637
You will live, you must live.

375
00:59:34,229 --> 00:59:43,788
Attention. People of the Earth. Turn on your Televisions.
That's Mars speaking. Now you will see...

376
00:59:44,621 --> 00:59:48,813
... a daughter of the far star,
saved by your kindness and bravery.

377
00:59:49,135 --> 00:59:54,983
She is with us, and breathes the Earth air,
though was born under a different Sun.

378
00:59:55,572 --> 01:00:01,876
Do you hear us, Mr. Laungton?
They've come to us with an open heart.

379
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:07,005
You said that you'll be happy
if your expectations were wrong

380
01:00:07,539 --> 01:00:10,276
You were wrong, Mr. Laungton.

381
01:00:10,675 --> 01:00:12,859
Be happy.

382
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:46,400
Yes, you shouldn't die.

383
01:00:48,869 --> 01:00:53,918
Only one hour we spent
in the dreams of Andrey.

384
01:00:54,268 --> 01:01:00,540
But his companions, not in dreams but in reality,
are singing songs for the Universe.

385
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:05,810
Are singing and will sing
new and more new songs.

386
01:01:09,513 --> 01:01:16,240
Where are you?

387
01:01:20,641 --> 01:01:23,520
Come here.
You know what happened?

388
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:26,716
Hurry up.

389
01:01:28,269 --> 01:01:32,731
Moscow speaks.

390
01:01:33,905 --> 01:01:39,015
All the radio stations of
the Soviet Union are working.

391
01:01:40,469 --> 01:01:43,414
This is information from
the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union.

392
01:01:44,827 --> 01:01:49,498
According to the program of the
circumsolar space research --

393
01:01:50,371 --> 01:01:57,140
spaceship OCEAN has been
launched to Mars.
