1
00:00:01,367 --> 00:00:04,167
- [Voiceover] What the fuck
you gone do besides pimp?

2
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:05,367
- [Filmore Slim] If
you live by the code,

3
00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:06,933
you die by the code, you know?

4
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:09,900
Pimp or die, it don't
stop till the casket drop.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,267
And all these young
people out there,

6
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:14,233
you understand me, look
up to Virgil Fairley.

7
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:16,800
They say, "Give him
a big thumbs up,

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,967
"'cause he's doing it. That's
brother's doing it, Jack!"

9
00:00:18,967 --> 00:00:20,733
- What's happening? It's
your boy, Dollar, man.

10
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:23,100
Down here in Fresno, California,

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,200
kicking it with my
uncle, Virgil Fairley,

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,233
shooting this documentary.

13
00:00:29,667 --> 00:00:33,533
One of the all-time greats,
players in the game, man.

14
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,000
- He was all fly and shit.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,067
He'd jump out his Cadillac,
he was clean as a bitch!

16
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:40,700
- I bought him a Rolls
Royce in 30 days.

17
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,833
And Virgil was pimping on
me, cold, chilly blood.

18
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,367
Cold, chilly, blood.

19
00:00:47,367 --> 00:00:48,900
His pimping was strict.

20
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,333
* And have a bitch's head
and keep her ass on the grind

21
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,200
* Ass on the line just to
see her daddy smile today

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,900
* Jewelry blinging you can
see me from a mile away

23
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,500
* Get a quarter before it's
over, she better find a way

24
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,967
* Or she'll be
sleeping on the corner

25
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:02,400
* I ain't got time to play

26
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,967
* No dummy, this ho
money for sho' money

27
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:07,633
* Step to me and you'll get
beat like you stole from me

28
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:09,233
* I want riches I want fame

29
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:11,767
* 'Cause I'm laced
with so much game

30
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:14,800
* So no matter what I do

31
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,233
- You are a living
legend, in the game.

32
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:20,733
And you are only of
the only brothers

33
00:01:20,733 --> 00:01:24,167
that they seen in
met that came in 1963

34
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:28,833
and still been able to
put in real large in 2013.

35
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,333
It's kind of unheard of.

36
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:37,067
- You gone see
Virgil and everybody

37
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:39,300
in the car with a
hat tilt to the side.

38
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,333
They gone have diamonds and
gold on just like they got now.

39
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:47,233
And people just actually
pulled to the side

40
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:50,367
and watched Virgil and
'nem drive down the street.

41
00:01:55,867 --> 00:02:00,867
(chattering)

42
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:11,967
- You know, because
I done been involved.

43
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:13,900
I done been in LA,
I been in Vegas.

44
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,633
I've been in Frisco with Virg,

45
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:17,067
and I mean, you know, you can't

46
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:19,067
be scared if you
want to go somewhere.

47
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:21,600
You always wanna
go where it's at.

48
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,433
And Virg will take you there.

49
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:26,533
You can see, you
can see that Virg

50
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:28,333
will take you somewhere
if you just listen.

51
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,100
- Virgil has always
been an inspiration

52
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,400
in our lives as we
coming up in the game.

53
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,467
- If Virgil was
still in the life,

54
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:40,100
I would definitely choose
up with someone like that.

55
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:45,100
Very well rounded,
amazing person, so.

56
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,067
For sure, that's
the main choice.

57
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:52,067
(chattering)

58
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:03,767
(soulful piano music)

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,867
- I met my nigga Virgil
in the early 80s.

60
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:12,067
This nigga had my
sister, Shirley,

61
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:14,733
his main bitch.

62
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:16,767
All right, check this out.

63
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:18,067
A lot of these niggas
been coming through

64
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,500
here tonight popping
this bullshit,

65
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,633
but I know it's a whole lot
of niggas that's been hating.

66
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:24,900
So, I'm here to clear
the motherfucking

67
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,467
record about a
whole lot of shit.

68
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:36,600
- I was raised up
in a family of six.

69
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,600
And my mother and
father worked real hard

70
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,833
for a living to take
care of all her kids.

71
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,100
And you know back
during that time

72
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:49,533
people wasn't really educated.

73
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:52,233
So, all they had to do
was depend on field work

74
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:56,500
or some kind of hard
construction job or,

75
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:58,867
or even if you had a job.

76
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:00,700
If you didn't have a
job, you're on welfare,

77
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,700
you know, living
poor, under poverty.

78
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,767
So, as I went to school--

79
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,133
You know my mother
raised us real

80
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:14,233
good to be just them two working

81
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,967
and all six kids.

82
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:19,800
So, I just about had everything
I ever wanted in life.

83
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,300
My mother took real
good care of me.

84
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,333
So, as I got older,

85
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:30,300
I didn't really like to work

86
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,533
because the only thing I seen

87
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:34,533
in the ideal of
work was that manual

88
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:36,833
labor that wasn't
getting no money.

89
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:40,733
I didn't see no
progress out of anything

90
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:43,767
that none of my friends and
things was doing in life.

91
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,767
So, when I got into
like 15, 16 years old,

92
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,967
I wanted to be a grown man.

93
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:53,900
I started feeling my, you know?

94
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,433
So, grown man did
what grown people do,

95
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:57,967
go to work! (laughter)

96
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:00,067
Something I didn't want to do.

97
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,667
So, anyway, I picked a
job that I like doing,

98
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,467
like pitching watermelon
and stuff of that nature.

99
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:07,100
But then on the
weekend my mother

100
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,300
wanted me to go cut some grapes,

101
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,433
pick cotton, that
was a no-no for me.

102
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:12,567
Every time I hit a
field, I'll get fired,

103
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:14,800
'cause I just, that
wasn't my thing,

104
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,700
picking no cotton
and cutting grapes.

105
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,700
But is really wasn't nothing
else to do in Fresno,

106
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,900
where you was raised up at.

107
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,300
- [Voiceover] Right.

108
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,067
- [Virgil] But anyway, I
was kind of smart in school.

109
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:28,433
So, I went to the
test for the city

110
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:31,200
when I turned 17, 18 years old.

111
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,600
'Cause I wanted
some things that I--

112
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,500
You know, a new car.

113
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,067
Passed the test, went to work.

114
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:44,700
Went and passed another
test, went to work.

115
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,067
Next thing I know I'm
fired from both jobs.

116
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:49,433
'Cause I had two jobs!
(laughter)

117
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,500
I guess they trying to
spread 'em out for everybody.

118
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,700
So, I had just bought
me a new Cadillac,

119
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,533
I was like 17, 18 years old.

120
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,167
Onliest youngster in
Fresno had a new Cadillac.

121
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,700
So, I'm riding
down Fresno Street,

122
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,467
trying to think
what could happen,

123
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:10,900
what I'm gone do next, I
gotta pay for my car now.

124
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,967
So, some lights start
blinking off and on.

125
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:16,767
And it's some girls
I went to school

126
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:18,800
with that was in
the game, right?

127
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,700
So, she asked could
she ride with me.

128
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,133
I said, "Yeah, come on."

129
00:06:23,833 --> 00:06:25,767
So them was two hos.

130
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,733
So the other girl started
hunching the other

131
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:29,533
girl talking about how
nice looking I was,

132
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:31,800
you know, how fine,
"Oh wee, I like him."

133
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:33,500
So, I went from there.

134
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,733
I dropped one girl off

135
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:36,900
and the other girl
chose me that night.

136
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,133
And it was no looking back.

137
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,933
That's what got
me into the game.

138
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:43,733
- When he was 13 years old,

139
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:47,500
he sold me pots
and pans in Fresno,

140
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:52,267
at the ho's motel,
called "Motel Row."

141
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:55,400
Sold me hot plates
to feed my women.

142
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,767
'Cause I had about
nine motel rooms.

143
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:02,500
So, this little boy
came and knocked on

144
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,967
my door and he say, "OG"
you know, "Pimpie" he say,

145
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:09,900
"You want to buy some pots
and pans for your girls?"

146
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,200
He didn't know
nothing about hos,

147
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,733
he said, "girls", okay?

148
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,100
So, I said, "Yeah."

149
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,200
So, he sold me pots and pans.

150
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,667
And I watched him grow up.

151
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,600
I watched Virgil grow up, now.

152
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,800
Billy Edwards, okay,
Dave Spirlot, okay,

153
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:29,367
Brougham Earl, Benny
Pace, that's Fresno.

154
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:32,800
That's the players
in Fresno, okay?

155
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,667
Virgil came up
under these people.

156
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:39,333
Virgil was the youngest player
that come out of Fresno,

157
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,800
although he put
Fresno on the map.

158
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,967
Now, Virgil was taught
by a old-school player

159
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:48,900
that turned Virgil out
was named Milton Peters.

160
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,233
- A guy by the name of
Foots and Milton Peters,

161
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:55,400
those the guys that I really
looked up to as a kid,

162
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,733
and pattern my style
after as far as

163
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:01,833
getting money, and being
a big giant in the game.

164
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,300
Thinking they kind of
really fascinated me.

165
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:09,933
So, he pulled me to
the curb and said,

166
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:13,367
"You got five or six ladies."

167
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,833
He said, "but what you
gone do when they run off?"

168
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:21,133
Well, at this time I
thought my game was good,

169
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:25,367
and you know, they was in it
to win it and there to stay.

170
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:27,267
- He invited me out there
to Charlotte with the

171
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:29,833
turnaround driveway out
there when he had the house.

172
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:30,967
He said, "Man, I
don't even invite many

173
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:32,267
"people coming to my houses,

174
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:34,233
"it's something about
you, Black, I like."

175
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:38,167
And we've been
hanging tough, 81!

176
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,333
No, 80 when I first
came through there.

177
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,200
I was on my way to Albuquerque.

178
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,533
Get us some (mumbles), he
said, "Man, where you going?"

179
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:45,600
I had a couple of
white girls in the car.

180
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,833
He said, "Where you going?"

181
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,233
I said, "Man, I don't
stay in California, man.

182
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:50,067
"I go everywhere, I chase money.

183
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:51,433
"If they tell me they
selling pussy in Africa,

184
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:52,700
"I'll try to get
over there, man."

185
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:58,833
- Yeah, this is
San Pablo and 35th.

186
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,333
Right here is the California
Hotel where some of

187
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:07,533
the famous players in
the world have came.

188
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:09,100
And this is where it all started

189
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,133
from with me, right here.

190
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,200
We go all the way
back to the 50s.

191
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,067
From here to Seventh Street,

192
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,167
all this was my turf here.

193
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:22,333
All down San Pablo.

194
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,967
Three or four blocks
around all around,

195
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,933
all the way up to MacArthur's.

196
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,933
- [Black] Hos used to work
all the way down there.

197
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:31,567
They used to work all the
way to MacArthur, right here,

198
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:33,667
all the way down this
side of the street.

199
00:09:33,667 --> 00:09:35,933
I mean, it was lined
up with hos, man.

200
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:37,967
- I always knew one
thing, the bigger

201
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:40,633
the city, the bigger the money.

202
00:09:40,633 --> 00:09:43,233
So, that's why I tried to
climb to the mountain top.

203
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:46,067
When I see there's a
bigger city, here I come.

204
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:48,267
- [Black] (laughter)
That's right.

205
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:49,867
That's where all the money was.

206
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:53,300
One of the most famous
hotels in town at one time.

207
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:59,467
208 was my room.

208
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,267
- [Black] Checked money
out this room, man!

209
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:03,700
- I used to stay
close to the door

210
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,667
just in case I had to
get away, I can get away.

211
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,400
You got the key to come in?

212
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,700
- [Black] It should be open.

213
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:14,933
- Hold on, Tito.

214
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,767
This is how it look now.

215
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,700
- [Black] They
remodeled it though.

216
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,633
And right here, you could
stand in this motherfucker

217
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:30,000
and look right down
on your ho, man.

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,700
Right down on this road.

219
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,267
- Where I parked
my car right, Jack.

220
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:35,967
and look right down on
my brand new Eldorado.

221
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:38,300
- [Black] Let me call you back.

222
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,800
But I just don't
like to see it dead

223
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,567
like this to be
truthful with you.

224
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,000
- [Virgil] Then I can
look right out across

225
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,533
the street and see all my girls,

226
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,900
all the ladies, walking
ladies of the evening.

227
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,167
- [Black] All his ladies and all

228
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:51,300
the potential might be ladies.

229
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,567
- [Virgil] Especially
mine 'cause I wanted

230
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:53,600
to see who was out of pocket.

231
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,900
(laughter)

232
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,400
Who was in pocket and
who was out of pocket.

233
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,433
- [Black] This was like a
penthouse view on the hos.

234
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:00,633
- If I see one
out of pocket from

235
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:02,367
right here, I can move on her.

236
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,767
She'd be mindful in the morning.

237
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:06,433
- It don't look right with pimps

238
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,067
and hos not walking
around here, man.

239
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,467
This is where all
the hos used to

240
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:12,633
get money up out of these
rooms and everything.

241
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:14,433
- [Voiceover] The city
of Oakland, California.

242
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:17,267
It was known as pimping,
drug-dealers, pimping.

243
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:19,733
In the 1960s and 70s,
there were so many

244
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:21,733
pimps in Oakland, that
the producer of the

245
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:24,667
most famous pimp
movie ever, The Mack,

246
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:26,067
decided Oakland would be the

247
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:27,633
perfect place to film the movie.

248
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,533
- That's a true story
though, we was at Joe Neal's.

249
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:31,833
Let's see, who was
all up in there?

250
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:35,433
JP, Michael Best,

251
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,100
you know, Michael Sweets.

252
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,567
It was the crew from
back in the days, right?

253
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:44,633
AP and they come
through Joe Neal's,

254
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:47,233
that's that nigga from Fresno.

255
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,767
Virgil was in town, that
nigga riding around here.

256
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:51,200
He got big jewelry--

257
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,733
- [Voiceover] Okay, what
year was this though, Blue?

258
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:57,433
- This was like 79, 80.

259
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,400
Right around in there,
you know what I'm saying?

260
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,133
And he come to town.

261
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:03,700
I think it was
one of those times

262
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,867
he was taking a
break from that bang,

263
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:08,900
and he come to town and
when the news come through

264
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,867
that motherfucker
Joe Neal's, man,

265
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:14,233
I'm talking about motherfuckers
headed up out the door!

266
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,833
I'm tripping,
'cause I don't know

267
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,967
no whole bunch about
Virgil at the time.

268
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:23,233
I had heard about
him and everything.

269
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:25,267
But this is when I
really get knowledge

270
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:27,567
and wanted to know how he was.

271
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,100
That incident there
is what made me

272
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,467
want to know who is this
motherfucker Virgil?

273
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:35,067
Motherfuckers just started
easing up out the club.

274
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:41,067
So, when me, Mellow and
JP rode through the track,

275
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:46,300
JP dropped me and
Mellow off at the car,

276
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,933
at the Cougar, we get
in the Cougar, and--

277
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,433
no it wasn't a Cougar,
it was a Mustang.

278
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:55,067
We get in the Mustang and JP
went and picked Marilyn up.

279
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:58,833
And JP had the Marilyn
bitch and the white bitch,

280
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,633
he went and picked
that bitch up.

281
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:02,600
Michael Best went and
picked his bitch up.

282
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,733
Gary Mack went and
picked a white bitch up.

283
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,700
It was a few niggas
riding up and down

284
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,700
the ho stroll with they hos
in the motherfucker car.

285
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,600
And the only thing
that I could see

286
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,333
that it was, it was
that nigga that was

287
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,500
in town with them
five or six bitches,

288
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,100
with all this big
jewelry that was

289
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,367
running up and down the track.

290
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:22,067
- He is a role model for

291
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,600
in this game and in life.

292
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,467
Not just this game but in life.

293
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:29,133
As a man and as a gentleman.

294
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:31,767
And I tip my hat to him.

295
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,400
I tip my hat to him.

296
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,900
He told me one time he said,

297
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:38,367
something that he can
do better than any man.

298
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:42,100
Virgil told me can't no
man out lie him to a bitch.

299
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,067
(laughter)

300
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,967
He said he was the best
and he'll challenge

301
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:49,067
any man to out lie, can't no
man out lie him from (mumbles).

302
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:51,067
- He coming through in Cadillacs

303
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:53,800
and popping it,
pimping, you know.

304
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
And that was exciting for us but

305
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,567
it was not only exciting,
but you could eat from it!

306
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:02,733
- [Voiceover] It was
a meal, it was a meal.

307
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:04,600
- [Capers] You got the
investor in the neighborhood.

308
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,900
You got to check out what it is

309
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,067
and see if you
can eat from this.

310
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:09,633
Everybody can't
eat from the game.

311
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:13,367
But Virg taught me how
to eat from the game.

312
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:16,900
I ain't ate as much, but I eat.

313
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,433
- First ho I had was on
this street right here.

314
00:14:19,433 --> 00:14:21,233
I took her straight
down to Chinatown.

315
00:14:21,233 --> 00:14:23,400
And that's where
I sit 'em down at.

316
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,233
We haven't gotten a
chance to see that yet.

317
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:26,567
- [Voiceover] Was she
black or white, Virg?

318
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:28,400
- Black girl out of Oakland.

319
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:31,133
That's where I first
got my choosing feet,

320
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:33,067
right down in Chinatown.

321
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,167
- [Voiceover] Was
she with somebody?

322
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,167
- Yeah, I had to serve somebody.

323
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,167
And now, that's one I
got written in my book.

324
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,733
- [Voiceover] How
he take the news?

325
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:44,267
- He didn't take it to nice.

326
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,067
He didn't take it at all.

327
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:48,367
- [Voiceover] So, your first
knock was kind of rough?

328
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:49,633
- Well, it wasn't
my first knock,

329
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:50,800
but it was with my first lesson.

330
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,700
It wasn't rough at
all 'cause you know

331
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,267
I was standing tall
through it all.

332
00:14:55,267 --> 00:15:00,300
(chattering)

333
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,733
- 14 years old, man,
14 years old, man!

334
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:11,767
That's how we do it in
Fresno, California, man.

335
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:13,167
- Fresno, California, man.

336
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,633
We making it happen, man!

337
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:16,733
We'll take your money and
your bitches up out here, man.

338
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:20,433
For real, man, don't come
out here playing man!

339
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:22,067
- We doing it right now
in this town! Right now!

340
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:24,467
Fresno, we doing
it right now, big!

341
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:25,700
Big shit popping!

342
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,733
- [Man in Hat] We got
the best in everything.

343
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:28,167
This non-stop out here, man.

344
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:29,400
- [G Money] We got the
best of everything.

345
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,567
- [Man in Hat] We got
the best of everything.

346
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,800
Yeah, this Cali's
finest right here, man!

347
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,400
- It got so foul
down in Los Angeles,

348
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,633
they came leaving three,
four weeks at a time.

349
00:15:40,633 --> 00:15:43,667
30 days at a time, some
time three days at a time.

350
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:50,200
I stayed down here about a year.

351
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,333
Moved back to Fresno,

352
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,667
where my roots was.

353
00:15:58,133 --> 00:15:59,867
And I regrouped.

354
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,200
Took a few minutes to look at
myself and look at my life.

355
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,867
Figured out what
I had to do next.

356
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:14,900
A friend of mine had moved back

357
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,400
named Foots, they call him JB.

358
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:19,433
He pulled me to
the curb and said,

359
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:23,167
"You know, you doing
real good up in the life.

360
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:26,067
"But it's one thing you missing.

361
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,067
"Your profession is pimping
but you also need a trade.

362
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:34,133
"You need something
to back you up.

363
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,067
"And if them hos ever
run off and leave

364
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:40,167
"again you got something to hold

365
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,067
"you until you
catch another one."

366
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,367
So, I didn't know what he was
talking about at that point.

367
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,067
And I had another friend
by the name of Player

368
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:55,600
that had the P game
and the D game down.

369
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,433
That's what everybody was
doing, from the old-school.

370
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:00,900
'Cause they was making
sure that they game never,

371
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,533
that they life never leaked.

372
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,733
So, these youngsters
got brainwashed about

373
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:10,633
all I do is drop the P
and I don't drop the D.

374
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:15,567
They're the ones that
was coming up short

375
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,233
and was leaking for months
and years at a time.

376
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:19,233
Some of them never did get back.

377
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:24,333
All they was relying on was
the name and not the fame.

378
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:27,300
I wanted them both,
the name and the fame.

379
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,367
So, I learned how
to have a profession

380
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:35,067
and a trade and I
done it real well.

381
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:38,133
- You got to put it down
the way he learned it.

382
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:39,600
Virgil went to that school.

383
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,900
Okay, a lot of people say,

384
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,900
"Virgil mixed it,
Virgil did that."

385
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,333
But Virgil put it down
the way he learned it.

386
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,700
And these OGs taught
Virgil how to put it down.

387
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,067
And it wasn't about,
you a pimp over here,

388
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:53,900
you a dope-dealer over there,
it was about the money.

389
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,133
- The brother was
a legend in himself

390
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:59,867
way before Black from Oakland,

391
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:02,133
Little D, Felix Mitchell.

392
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:05,533
Virgil name rang
with Frank Ward,

393
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:09,967
Ted Ward, Willie Ward,
the infamous famous macks.

394
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:14,800
The man had sack along
with other fellas

395
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,067
that rang boss, Roger Gill,

396
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:24,200
Terrible Tom, but
Virgil stood out.

397
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,667
- This was a nigga right
here that know how to get it.

398
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,700
That know how to get
it out the pussy,

399
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,367
and however it is a motherfucker

400
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:33,367
have to get it to get his money.

401
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:34,800
You know, pimping
is pimping, nigga!

402
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,900
- I'm letting ya' know, this
man feed a lot of people,

403
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,600
a lot of people!

404
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,233
Give everybody a chance!

405
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:43,567
I ain't got nothing bad
to say about Virgil.

406
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:45,800
When I was down,
when I was coming

407
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,067
up in the record business,

408
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:48,867
motherfucker slipped
me a couple of dollars,

409
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:50,900
to keep me rolling,
this is why Kevin Black

410
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,833
got a lot of this
artillery up here.

411
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,633
It ain't been a rapper
I ain't touched.

412
00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:59,433
Take that one to the bank.

413
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,100
I told him, I said,
"Virg, this is the plan.

414
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
"I'm a try to be
the best I can be."

415
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,600
Virg said, "Aye--

416
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,500
I remember back in the
day, Virg used to have...

417
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,133
I hope I'm not telling too
much but keep the camera going.

418
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:15,433
(laughter) Virg used
to have sacks of money!

419
00:19:15,433 --> 00:19:16,600
I'm talking about sacks!

420
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,267
I'm talking about
real sacks of money.

421
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:20,500
Money rubber banded up,
every fucking thing.

422
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,533
So, I used to walk
in, young nigga,

423
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:23,600
you know, I'm just saying,

424
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,433
"What's up Virg, how you doing?

425
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,633
"Can you give your little
nephew a little something?"

426
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:32,333
He used to tell me,
"Don't go in there

427
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,867
"and get what you
want, go in there

428
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:35,167
"and get what you need!"

429
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:36,500
You see stacks stand up,

430
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,100
you don't know what
they fuck to take!

431
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,400
Don't go in there and get what
you want, get what you need!

432
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,867
I opened up a sack, shit
looked so green in there,

433
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:46,333
I thought I was in the
grass playing jump rope.

434
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,967
(laughter)

435
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:51,533
He said, "Take what your
hands can hold, nigga!"

436
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:53,767
Oh shit, I'm dropping
shit going out.

437
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:56,333
That's back in my days,
that's how I remember Virgil.

438
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,967
- Yeah, I've been knowing
Virg all of my life.

439
00:19:57,967 --> 00:20:01,733
Ever since Edison
High, Tigers for life.

440
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,400
So I've been knowing
him all my life.

441
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,900
He's always been a leader,
a leader among men.

442
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:10,367
My friend, my partner,
my best friend.

443
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,500
Helped me through a
lot of crisis in life.

444
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:16,200
* You ain't the
working kind of nigga

445
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,967
* You needs to keep it pimping

446
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,133
* Tell me, what you
know about this pimping

447
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:39,600
* It's more than the clothes
if I walk with a limp and

448
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,300
* Would rather the ho and
the money that she getting

449
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,967
* She ain't making dollars,
she ain't making sense then

450
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:47,567
* Please listen to this
game that I'm spitting *

451
00:20:49,933 --> 00:20:52,600
- This sign was put here

452
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,800
by the Los Angeles Police

453
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,067
because it was hos
all around here.

454
00:20:59,433 --> 00:21:04,433
The tricks would turn the corner
every minute on the minute.

455
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,867
That sign right
there was put there

456
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:09,700
so the tricks had to go
all the way out the way

457
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,333
and not stop, this
used to be the spot.

458
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,167
- I got off into the
life about 10 years.

459
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:22,167
Did about a 10 year
flat in the life.

460
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:24,233
Hey, I done touched
down in all the states,

461
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:29,233
I done touched down
in Hawaii, Las Vegas,

462
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:32,467
the Bay area, of course,
that was my stomping ground,

463
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:36,067
there's where I got my
money, got my paper.

464
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:38,333
I was folding paper
from the Bay area.

465
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:43,600
Hollywood, California,
that's where the fame,

466
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:45,767
took name.

467
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:49,967
As far as Hugh Grant, yeah, I
believe I put him on the map

468
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:53,267
in the United States of America.

469
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:56,467
He put me on the map as
well, over there in the UK.

470
00:21:56,467 --> 00:21:59,133
So, it was vice versa
but I think I did

471
00:21:59,133 --> 00:22:04,133
more of a, making him a well
known actor here in the states,

472
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,567
in America, you know?

473
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:10,900
Back when everything
had hit the fan,

474
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,700
they done made it
into a big scandal,

475
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:19,133
well, I was eating before that.

476
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:21,900
We was eating real
good, we was driving

477
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,600
big Rolls Royces and
Cadillacs, and things,

478
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,233
and wearing big jewelry and
living good before all that.

479
00:22:28,233 --> 00:22:30,833
It helped, it helped a big deal.

480
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:33,767
Out of all the time
that I've been to jail

481
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:36,667
and I done got popped,
that was the most

482
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:40,533
beneficial time that I ever
experienced in my life.

483
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,233
So, I wouldn't take that back
for nothing in the world!

484
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,867
- My status, my
goals, everything?

485
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,333
I want to be a boss bitch.

486
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:52,500
I want to have my own shit
and have my own bitches.

487
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,200
You know, take the
stress of myself

488
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,733
so I don't have to do shit,

489
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:57,367
which that's what
I'm working for.

490
00:22:57,367 --> 00:22:58,567
Eventually, I'll have it.

491
00:22:58,567 --> 00:22:59,833
It takes a lot of work,

492
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,933
a lot of focus and if
you have any outside

493
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:06,500
interference then you will
get pulled right back down.

494
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,733
So, stay focused, keep
your mind on the money

495
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,567
and you'll be good.

496
00:23:10,567 --> 00:23:12,733
- I never had women
to control my kingdom,

497
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:13,900
nothing go through my women.

498
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,833
I controlled
everything that I done.

499
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:21,567
No women call the shots on me.

500
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,200
I call all the shots.

501
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,367
They got to know they got a man

502
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:27,100
in they arena.

503
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:28,900
- When I first got in the life,

504
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,733
things were totally different.

505
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,200
The game has totally changed

506
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,767
and girls are different.

507
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:38,233
In Chicago, we run things like

508
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:41,300
nobody solo, we
all have a person

509
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,333
and you will never catch a solo

510
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:47,900
girl out here doing anything
that's worth something.

511
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,967
So, we do know that the
game is so much different

512
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:54,600
because girls are lazy.

513
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,433
We get on our feet and we work.

514
00:23:56,433 --> 00:23:58,600
The internet has changed
the whole game up.

515
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,600
In Chicago we ride
in Lexus', Bentleys,

516
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,100
Mercedes, BMWs, all that.

517
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,567
But there's always the
back up guy behind us.

518
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:14,400
He takes care of us 100%.

519
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,200
We're loyal, loyal,
loyal girls, always.

520
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,233
- You know, Virgil was
always good to his women

521
00:24:21,233 --> 00:24:23,133
from what I saw
and what I heard.

522
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:24,833
Matter of fact, one of Virgil's

523
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:26,467
girls went to school with me.

524
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:28,067
We went to high school together

525
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,133
and that was his bottom woman.

526
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:34,267
I'd say, that pimp word
would be bottom bitch.

527
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:37,500
Okay, that's what they
say in the pimp game.

528
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,367
And I remember her
in high school,

529
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:42,133
and I kind of had a feeling in

530
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:45,067
high school that she
was prostituting.

531
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:48,067
But I couldn't
put my name on it.

532
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:50,067
But I learned
later on that yeah,

533
00:24:50,067 --> 00:24:51,933
she was out there
prostituting for Virgil

534
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:54,200
and this was when I
was in high school.

535
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,100
And when I got out
of high school,

536
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,700
Virgil was still pimping her,

537
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,400
and when I became
a police officer.

538
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,833
So, he had that girl
for a long time.

539
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:08,067
I mean it was maybe

540
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:12,233
8, 9 years he had this girl

541
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:14,067
and he had her out on the
street working for him

542
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:17,300
I don't know but I heard that
her momma was working too.

543
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,600
So, Virgil might of had her
momma out there working too!

544
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,733
(laughter)

545
00:25:21,733 --> 00:25:23,133
- I never would
have got with Virgil

546
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:27,667
because I had a girlfriend
that dealt with Virgil

547
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,667
and so therefore,

548
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:37,067
no questions, no, I wouldn't
have done that because

549
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:41,367
my homegirl dealt with him
and things of that nature.

550
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:44,333
So, that would have been
out of the question.

551
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:48,200
He's a fly cat to me,
he do his thing so...

552
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:51,367
He just a cool buddy of mine.

553
00:25:51,367 --> 00:25:54,667
I would have never
made that suggestion

554
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:57,333
'cause me and my homegirl,
we best of friends,

555
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:59,333
we tight like that
and it never would

556
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:02,733
have came across paths
with me and old Virg.

557
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:04,200
- I've been in the
game a long time.

558
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,067
I never considered myself,

559
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,067
using a title as pimp.

560
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:13,500
I have them call me by my name.

561
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,500
Because it's a lot of
versions when it come to pimp.

562
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:19,367
Control of your kingdom.

563
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:24,267
They say a lot of different
other things about a pimp

564
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:27,267
that I really don't want to say,

565
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,133
because it's a
whole lot of people

566
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:32,767
who got different meanings
of where "pimp" come from.

567
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:34,933
I'm a mack and a player.

568
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:37,433
That's how I get down.

569
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:40,800
I don't even use the term,
"pimp" when it come to me.

570
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,133
I'm a shaker and a mover
and a money handler.

571
00:26:46,733 --> 00:26:48,267
Do I send women to work?

572
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:49,633
Have I sent women to work?

573
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:50,767
Yes, I have.

574
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:53,300
Have I been 12, 15, 17 deep?

575
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,533
Yes I have, but I still
didn't use that word

576
00:26:58,567 --> 00:27:00,933
because nobody know
the true meaning of it.

577
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:03,200
They just use that word

578
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,967
because it sound cute to use.

579
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:15,767
To each his own, like
I say, you can...

580
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:21,667
If it make you feel good, if
it sound good, it's all good.

581
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,167
But it's a million
ways to get to the top,

582
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:28,067
just as long as you get there

583
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:30,233
shaking hands with the
ones that's at the top

584
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,633
but you can only
count at the top.

585
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:35,800
How many people really
do get to the top?

586
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,800
- Hi, my name is Baby Doll.

587
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,600
- Hi, my name is Lollipop.

588
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,133
- Hi, my name is Tipsy.

589
00:27:41,133 --> 00:27:43,333
- Hi, my name is Charming.

590
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,867
- [All Ladies] And
we're Virgil's Angels.

591
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:47,700
- A real pimp,
he'll sell his self,

592
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,933
but a mack ain't gone do it,

593
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,733
he gone get it the
best way he know how.

594
00:27:51,733 --> 00:27:53,667
And that's one way, get it!

595
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:58,767
Virgil rang through Frisco,

596
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:01,433
Oakland, Bay area, Grey Girls,

597
00:28:01,433 --> 00:28:03,100
Sisters, Asians,

598
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,700
and his name rang real,

599
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:09,900
very credible in the street.

600
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,100
- We ain't get knocked.

601
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,567
I can damn near
count on one hand

602
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:13,933
how many times I got knocked.

603
00:28:13,933 --> 00:28:16,567
- It's hard to knock me, hard!

604
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:20,633
See, my game started
from the bedroom.

605
00:28:20,633 --> 00:28:22,933
That's where I done
all my pimping from.

606
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:25,267
Once I get in
baby's ear and I get

607
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:28,300
ready to send her
out that front door,

608
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,733
and she goes and hits the track,

609
00:28:30,733 --> 00:28:32,200
it's hard to get me.

610
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,200
- I tell motherfuckers "from
the sheets to the streets."

611
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,167
- No doubt about that. (laughs)

612
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:38,333
From the sheets to the streets.

613
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,167
- From the sheets
to the streets, man.

614
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:43,633
- A lot of niggas just send a
woman out the door with no--

615
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:46,333
- Instructions, at all!

616
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:49,467
- And what she gone do?

617
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:52,133
Listen to what nothing
but hos tell her.

618
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:55,400
And they gone give her
mixed up instructions.

619
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,133
- So, I learned how
to have a profession

620
00:28:59,133 --> 00:29:01,967
and a trade, and I
done it real well.

621
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,767
So, I make sure I put
myself in position

622
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:08,867
not to ever get in
bad shape ever again.

623
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,300
One time was too much for me.

624
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,533
I didn't even like the feeling

625
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:19,533
of not being able to and
I like to do as I please.

626
00:29:21,533 --> 00:29:25,067
So, I took the ball
and ran with it

627
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,833
took it to a professional level.

628
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,067
And the onliest thing
that can stop me

629
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:38,700
is the chase or making
a mistake or slips

630
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,500
or whatever it might have been.

631
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:46,400
So, I mastered the game
for a long, long time.

632
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:50,200
Sure it's in everybody--

633
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,600
Slips don't count
until you fall.

634
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:56,167
So, everybody gonna
slip but as long

635
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:58,267
as you don't fall
down, you all right.

636
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,467
- I was a police
officer, I knew all

637
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:03,000
the major players on the street.

638
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,500
I knew the big boys
and by knowing them

639
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,533
you hear things that happened to

640
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:15,200
other hustlers, I
refer to them as

641
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,367
hustlers because they
didn't have a job.

642
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,667
They job was the streets and
they hustled their income.

643
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:24,367
One thing in particular
that stood with me

644
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:27,233
that another hustler
told me about Virgil,

645
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:32,233
I didn't participate
in it but I heard

646
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:36,467
this from another hustler,
who later was shot and killed,

647
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:41,233
that always intrigued
me about Virgil,

648
00:30:41,233 --> 00:30:43,267
there was three major players on

649
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:45,733
the street that intrigued me.

650
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:48,367
They were kind,

651
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:52,767
they were always overdressed,

652
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:55,767
and when I say overdressed,
most people dress up

653
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:59,133
when they go out to party
or have a good time.

654
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:00,633
Every day on the streets was a

655
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:03,767
party for Virgil
and his cronies.

656
00:31:05,267 --> 00:31:09,100
You'd see a convertible
Eldorado Cadillac

657
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,733
coming down the street
with the top down,

658
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:16,133
you gone see Virgil and
everybody in the car

659
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:18,067
with a hat tilt to the side.

660
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:20,267
They gone have
diamonds and gold on

661
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:22,200
just like they got now.

662
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,233
And people just actually
pulled to the side

663
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:29,767
and watched Virgil and
'nem drive down the street.

664
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:32,300
- I lived next door to
the highway patrolman.

665
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,433
I got the school
teacher on this side.

666
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:36,633
And everybody was at the window.

667
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:38,533
And here comes this long, old,

668
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:42,267
Zimmer car coming
up the street, okay?

669
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,067
You can't even see over
the hood of it, okay.

670
00:31:46,167 --> 00:31:47,900
And here come
Virgil and everybody

671
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,267
is watching him
like, "Who is this?"

672
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:53,600
But he'd pull up in my driveway
told me to open the garage.

673
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,067
I'd hit the garage button and
put half of the car in there,

674
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:58,067
'cause the other
half wouldn't go in.

675
00:31:58,067 --> 00:32:00,467
So, the rest of it was
sitting in the street.

676
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:02,600
And this drawed a
big crowd of people.

677
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,400
So, they wanted to
know who Virgil was.

678
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,167
I said, "Well, he's
my personal friend."

679
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:08,800
Virgil went out, I told him
to come in the house, he say,

680
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,067
"I told you to come
on and go with me."

681
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:12,867
He say, "Go out there
and pop the trunk.

682
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:15,067
"Here the keys," you
know, 'cause my girl

683
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,533
was fixing him a plate of food.

684
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:19,433
"Go out there and pop the
trunk and get what you need.

685
00:32:19,433 --> 00:32:20,767
"Get all you can get."

686
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:22,733
I went out there and
popped the trunk.

687
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:25,833
Virgil had a bale
of money, okay?

688
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:28,933
Just like hay for
a horse, right?

689
00:32:28,933 --> 00:32:31,900
He had a bale of money
in the trunk of that car.

690
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,267
And he said, "Get all you can,
fill up all your pockets."

691
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:38,067
And I was grabbing.
I was grabbing money.

692
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:40,300
I was putting money
everywhere I could.

693
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,900
You understand me? And he said,

694
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,967
"But you can't use
no bag or no sack,

695
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:45,833
"just all you can
put in your pocket."

696
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:48,367
So, I had all my pockets, I
was putting money in there.

697
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:49,600
I come in there
looking like, hey,

698
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,400
I had so much
money in my pocket.

699
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,367
He said, "Now, that's
what you would have had,

700
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:55,600
"if you would have
went with me!"

701
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,967
- When you see
Virgil and his boys

702
00:32:56,967 --> 00:32:58,467
riding in the car together,

703
00:32:58,467 --> 00:33:02,267
they would wear what we
call "Godfather Hats,"

704
00:33:02,267 --> 00:33:04,867
and they would lean
to the side like this,

705
00:33:04,867 --> 00:33:06,967
and you knew that
that was Virgil

706
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:08,967
and his boys because they
thought they was clean,

707
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:11,633
which they were clean
'cause they was--

708
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:13,500
we called it, they
were "styling" then.

709
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:17,833
- One particular
time I saw Virgil and

710
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:20,500
a counterpart of his
come through Chinatown.

711
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,500
I was walking the beat.

712
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,733
And you knew when
Virgil was in town,

713
00:33:26,733 --> 00:33:28,567
out of town,

714
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,333
because the people
on the street,

715
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:34,800
they responded to
it, and you could see

716
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,833
the people on the
street in Chinatown.

717
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:40,633
They would all move to
the side on F Street.

718
00:33:40,633 --> 00:33:42,667
You knew somebody
important was coming.

719
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:45,100
They moved to the east
side of the street,

720
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,067
so they could watch the show.

721
00:33:49,067 --> 00:33:50,933
And about five minutes later,

722
00:33:50,933 --> 00:33:53,467
me and my partner was
standing on the corner

723
00:33:53,467 --> 00:33:56,467
and we say all the
girls move to the side,

724
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,233
we knew somebody
was coming through.

725
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:02,667
And it was Virgil driving
and his counterpart.

726
00:34:03,433 --> 00:34:07,233
They were the biggest hustlers
in Fresno at that time.

727
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:15,633
A week or so later, I saw
Virgil come back through Fresno,

728
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:18,700
through F Street in Chinatown.

729
00:34:19,633 --> 00:34:22,167
They were so clean that I
think even police officers

730
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:25,500
wanted to take a picture
of him 'cause (laughter)

731
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,200
we used to admire the
way they was dressed.

732
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,567
You know, we had the
blue on, the blue hat.

733
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:35,167
They come in with
white Kangol hats

734
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:36,800
and three-piece-suits.

735
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,367
They had walking
suits back then.

736
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,367
Every thing was white,
every thing blue,

737
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:44,200
every thing was pink
and then all the

738
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,667
gold and diamonds showing.

739
00:34:47,067 --> 00:34:48,800
And you know, I
felt that sometimes

740
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,433
I should have been
protecting them

741
00:34:50,433 --> 00:34:54,067
so they wouldn't get
robbed. (laughter)

742
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,833
But one story in particular,
I'm a get back to that,

743
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:01,433
is that I heard
Virgil got busted and

744
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,833
the police department
in those days,

745
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:06,433
you knew every thing
about every body.

746
00:35:06,433 --> 00:35:09,067
But you couldn't take
it out of headquarters.

747
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,733
And we heard that Virgil
was one of the only

748
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:20,433
Blacks at that time, that
the Mafia would deal with.

749
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:26,667
This is what we heard
through other hustlers.

750
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:29,800
And these were top dogs,
when I say, "top dogs,"

751
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,533
they didn't deal with 5,000,

752
00:35:32,533 --> 00:35:35,833
10,000, $20,000 sales.

753
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:41,600
They made purchases, you know,

754
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,933
big purchases, bundle purchases,

755
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:46,300
moved bundles of drugs.

756
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:48,700
- [Voiceover] Get some of that.

* Nortes and Eses

778
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:39,900
- But when I was coming
up into the life,

779
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,667
people that was dealing with
hos dealt with drugs too.

780
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,833
They all was surrounded
by one little circle.

781
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:48,267
It's all in the game.

782
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,367
The most easiest and safest,

783
00:36:54,067 --> 00:36:56,233
simplest thing was
talking a woman

784
00:36:56,233 --> 00:36:59,067
into going to get
those two and fews.

785
00:37:00,433 --> 00:37:02,800
But when it come
to the drug game,

786
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,200
those twos and fews came into

787
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,767
threes and fours,
and five and sixes.

788
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:10,733
That's what makes
the money bigger.

789
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:13,167
You can send a woman to work,

790
00:37:13,167 --> 00:37:14,867
she might not even
break luck that night.

791
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,167
All your money getting
ready to be limited.

792
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,400
But when you handling something

793
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,133
that a person got to have,

794
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:24,967
they gone think of
any means necessary

795
00:37:24,967 --> 00:37:26,233
to go and get that money,

796
00:37:26,233 --> 00:37:27,933
and they gone spend that
money on what they need.

797
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:29,567
- Virgil was first
introduced to me

798
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:32,333
through I would
say, my OG Bianca.

799
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:35,100
She was explaining
to me about her past

800
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,067
and the type of
lifestyle she lived,

801
00:37:37,067 --> 00:37:39,500
and Virgil was a big
aspect in her life.

802
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:42,967
Everything I heard was positive.

803
00:37:42,967 --> 00:37:45,867
Nothing negative,
everything was positive

804
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:47,867
from the way that
he treated his hos,

805
00:37:47,867 --> 00:37:51,067
to the way that he just
treated people in general.

806
00:37:51,067 --> 00:37:53,667
- Riverside, Oceanside,

807
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:57,900
I've heard his name for years.

808
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,867
Virgil would flip
his cars every year.

809
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:04,167
And so was his girls',
and that impressed me.

810
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:06,700
Because I was getting money,

811
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,300
but I couldn't figure out how

812
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,800
they were getting
that kind of money

813
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,767
and able to flip
a car every year.

814
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:14,567
- Virgil put me in
a position where

815
00:38:14,567 --> 00:38:17,500
I was rubbing elbows
with millionaires.

816
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:21,067
And I used to get so much money.

817
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:25,167
I don't think that he
ever had a lady of leisure

818
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:30,167
that made money like me,
'cause I got Rolls Royce money.

819
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:32,100
I got white girl money.

820
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,367
Like I'll out-check
50 white girls,

821
00:38:35,367 --> 00:38:37,333
because I had flavor, I could be

822
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:39,967
any color that I wanted,
I would be Samoan.

823
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:42,267
I could color my
hair blonde, I'd be

824
00:38:42,267 --> 00:38:46,467
any nationality that
he wanted me to be.

825
00:38:46,467 --> 00:38:48,867
So, we really, we got big money!

826
00:38:48,867 --> 00:38:51,700
- I heard about Virgil
when Tina would tell me

827
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,900
she was with this guy,
Virgil, back in the days.

828
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,533
I just finally had the
pleasure of meeting him.

829
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:58,333
I met her when I
moved to Atlanta.

830
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:02,067
I worked at Magic City,
I worked at Pin Ups.

831
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:05,667
And I worked at Dirty Reds.

832
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:08,067
Those were my main
clubs in Atlanta,

833
00:39:08,067 --> 00:39:10,733
and I worked there, I
made like 1000 a night.

834
00:39:10,733 --> 00:39:13,633
And sometimes your feet hurt,

835
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:16,433
and you just want to
get some flat backing.

836
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:17,733
So that's what I did.

837
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:22,133
- And during that time,
the Black Panthers were

838
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:25,067
extorting a lot of
brothers in the street

839
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:27,067
with their
revolutionary stuff of,

840
00:39:27,067 --> 00:39:28,800
"You got to give something
back to the hood."

841
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,667
And he was one of
the brothers that

842
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:32,067
they didn't get at like that.

843
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:33,200
So, if you know what I mean,

844
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,367
if they didn't get
at you like that,

845
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:38,133
that mean that he ain't
to be played with.

846
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,067
- You can draw your conclusion
on the one little thing,

847
00:39:41,067 --> 00:39:44,567
but that one thing can
cover a million miles.

848
00:39:45,933 --> 00:39:47,633
It could be one dot.

849
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:52,300
That's where your
mathematics come from.

850
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:54,833
The whole world is
built on mathematics.

851
00:39:56,067 --> 00:39:57,567
If you're able to figure
your problems out,

852
00:39:57,567 --> 00:40:01,267
you're able to figure out
what the world is doing.

853
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,600
The whole world is about
money, making money.

854
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:12,900
They have less morals
about themselves than I do.

855
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:15,367
A lot of things I
won't do for money.

856
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,167
You got cops killing
people for money.

857
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,300
They work every day,
get trained to kill,

858
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,100
and that's what
they go out and do.

859
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,500
Right or wrong.

860
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,833
I would not do that for money.

861
00:40:28,867 --> 00:40:30,867
That's where my morals step in.

862
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,833
I would not steal
nothing for money.

863
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:40,400
I'm a player, I ask for mine.

864
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,533
I don't abuse nobody for money.

865
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:46,500
I don't misuse people for money.

866
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,467
So, that's where
my morals step in.

867
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:49,800
- He's better than me because I

868
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,033
don't have the patience for it.

869
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,867
I can only tolerate so much.

870
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:55,400
You can only train a
bitch to do so much

871
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,600
and at the end of the day,

872
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,033
he's been doing this
for so many years,

873
00:40:58,033 --> 00:41:00,067
obviously it come
natural to him.

874
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:02,700
But every thing I've heard
about him has been positive.

875
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:06,333
- My sister was one
of the best, I think

876
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:11,300
at pickpocketing,
she used to work with

877
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,333
her fingers and her toes.

878
00:41:14,667 --> 00:41:16,833
I never mastered that,
I wish I could have.

879
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:19,933
But I never mastered it
but she was a good girl.

880
00:41:19,933 --> 00:41:22,133
She was also a
trouble-maker though.

881
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,300
She was spoiled,
she was jealous.

882
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:31,600
So she was quite a
trouble-maker for Virgil.

883
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,267
- Again, I've heard a lot of

884
00:41:35,267 --> 00:41:39,300
information about Virgil being
involved in the pimp game,

885
00:41:40,733 --> 00:41:43,133
drugs, drug activity.

886
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,767
I used to walk the
beat in Chinatown.

887
00:41:47,133 --> 00:41:48,600
And two officers
would walk the beat

888
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,833
in Chinatown and Virg's
girls would work the street.

889
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:56,200
We would have to stop

890
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,067
and talk to some of these girls.

891
00:41:58,067 --> 00:42:00,367
When we stopped
and talked to them,

892
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:02,100
we had a little black book.

893
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,667
And in our little black book,

894
00:42:03,667 --> 00:42:06,467
we would write down
the girl's name,

895
00:42:06,467 --> 00:42:08,233
and the reason why
we would write down

896
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:10,800
the girl's name because
some of these girls

897
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,833
would rob the johns.

898
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:16,833
The johns would go into a
room with them and rob 'em.

899
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:19,200
And then we'd go through
our little black book.

900
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,833
"Oh, this is so and so.

901
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:24,433
"Her pimp is Virgil Fairley."

902
00:42:24,433 --> 00:42:27,700
- Yeah, we on our way down to

903
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,433
where I got arrested at.

904
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:33,933
And I had never had a
case before in my life.

905
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:37,567
I had been charged with a
lot of things, railroaded,

906
00:42:38,067 --> 00:42:40,767
police lied on me
and did all type

907
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,067
of things to railroad me but,

908
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:45,167
that's what caused them to take

909
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:48,867
all my toys and
money and jewelry,

910
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,200
minks and furniture and houses.

911
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:55,667
They did that a few times.

912
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:58,400
So, they put me in a
position where I had to

913
00:43:00,133 --> 00:43:02,067
work double hard to get back.

914
00:43:02,067 --> 00:43:05,600
- One of his buddies
in Beverly Hills,

915
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:10,133
we raided them from
Fresno, a task force

916
00:43:10,133 --> 00:43:14,300
about 40 of us, top dog brother.

917
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,733
We busted him, we
went in his house,

918
00:43:16,733 --> 00:43:19,567
he had two bales of cocaine.

919
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:25,467
We confiscated the
two safes that he had.

920
00:43:25,467 --> 00:43:26,933
We took his safes.

921
00:43:26,933 --> 00:43:29,967
Opened 'em up he had two
and a half million dollars.

922
00:43:31,133 --> 00:43:32,800
Virgil name and two other guys,

923
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,600
players in Fresno
name was in the safe,

924
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,700
and that's when they
started tracking him.

925
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,067
* I got my money on my mind

926
00:43:41,067 --> 00:43:43,167
- [Voiceover] The Sacramento
Police and the FBI

927
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:46,367
came together and arrested
Ray Virgil Fairley,

928
00:43:46,367 --> 00:43:49,867
the morning of
November 19, 1992.

929
00:43:49,867 --> 00:43:52,100
They raided four of his houses,

930
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,100
and confiscated over a
million dollars in cash,

931
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:58,867
jewelry, mink
coats, exotic cars,

932
00:43:58,867 --> 00:44:02,800
that included Rolls Royce,
Golden Spirit Zimmer,

933
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,400
Mercedes Benz, and 17 other cars

934
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,300
were put on trucks
and towed away.

935
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,900
When Virgil went to trial,

936
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,067
everyone in Sacramento's
law enforcement

937
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:15,367
came to court to see who
was this kingpin was,

938
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:17,733
the mystery man,
the man that was

939
00:44:17,733 --> 00:44:20,167
never on their bust list,

940
00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:22,100
the one that almost got away.

941
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,533
- I come up out of there,
that's the worst thing

942
00:44:23,533 --> 00:44:25,467
that could have happened,
this is the jail, here.

943
00:44:25,467 --> 00:44:28,767
That was the courthouse, this
was first courthouse here.

944
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:31,100
And the jails was
all upstairs there.

945
00:44:33,133 --> 00:44:35,867
That's where I learned
I shouldn't have done,

946
00:44:35,867 --> 00:44:38,100
handled my business
certain ways,

947
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,800
take certain chances,

948
00:44:41,433 --> 00:44:44,267
put myself in certain positions
I should have been in.

949
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:46,067
I learned a whole
lot 'cause a whole

950
00:44:46,067 --> 00:44:47,567
lot of people there
was just like me.

951
00:44:47,567 --> 00:44:49,200
- Yeah, that's the
big yard right there,

952
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,267
administration building, that's
the big yard, right there.

953
00:44:52,267 --> 00:44:53,833
Big white part.

954
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:56,467
The gym right there.

955
00:44:56,467 --> 00:44:57,933
- [Voiceover] How much
time you do over there?

956
00:44:57,933 --> 00:45:02,867
- I did a couple of
years over there.

957
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,967
But that was back
in the day though.

958
00:45:04,967 --> 00:45:07,333
And motherfuckers used to
come by on they boats, man.

959
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:09,300
And broads would show
they titties and shit.

960
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,967
And I'd be like, damn,
one day, one day!

961
00:45:11,967 --> 00:45:13,267
(laughter)

962
00:45:13,267 --> 00:45:16,267
One day, that's gone
be me! (laughter)

963
00:45:16,267 --> 00:45:17,667
- [Voiceover] Now, here you are!

964
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:19,967
Now, here I am, Jamie, show
your titties. (laughter)

965
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,500
* With all that
pussy popping girl

966
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,700
* Girl, with all
that pussy popping

967
00:45:28,733 --> 00:45:29,867
* Big O, we love
that pussy popping

968
00:45:29,867 --> 00:45:31,100
* It's pretty simple,
big booty Judy

969
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,667
* Over cutie-patootie
with tiggle biggles

970
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:33,800
* Her bottom booty, snooty booty

971
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,267
* With pretty dimples
and itty-bitty

972
00:45:35,267 --> 00:45:36,700
* Titty committee
with pretty nipples *

973
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,867
- We had a mutual respect,
I knew all of 'em.

974
00:45:40,633 --> 00:45:42,067
If you didn't do
it in front of me,

975
00:45:42,067 --> 00:45:43,967
you could stay on the street.

976
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,633
But you can't jeopardize my job

977
00:45:47,633 --> 00:45:49,833
by doing something illegal,

978
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,700
I got to come get you.

979
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:56,333
- I Always considered myself
kind of smooth and smart

980
00:45:56,333 --> 00:46:01,333
but you know, but one
slip can kill you off.

981
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:05,633
- Okay, I seen him
fall five times,

982
00:46:05,633 --> 00:46:07,267
and raise back up.

983
00:46:07,967 --> 00:46:10,067
I got a friend that fell down

984
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:11,300
and ain't never got back up.

985
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,367
They still falling.

986
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:14,233
- I appreciate your struggle,

987
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:16,067
you know, everything
you been through.

988
00:46:16,067 --> 00:46:17,633
You know, especially
the good times.

989
00:46:17,633 --> 00:46:19,333
We just gone do the whole
movie on the good times.

990
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:22,200
We ain't gone go there.

991
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,500
Everybody go through
ups and downs,

992
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,067
you feel me, but we
gone make sure that we--

993
00:46:25,067 --> 00:46:26,333
No, I'm just kidding,
but we gone touch

994
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:27,867
on it all, you know
what I'm saying?

995
00:46:27,867 --> 00:46:29,500
But it's good to be thought of

996
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,333
for roles or for
characters on guys

997
00:46:32,333 --> 00:46:34,600
that really made an impact,

998
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,633
where ever they
make their impact,

999
00:46:37,467 --> 00:46:38,733
however they make their impact,

1000
00:46:38,733 --> 00:46:40,300
and guys that are
still doing it,

1001
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,933
that are still relevant.

1002
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:43,067
And you pay homage to these cats

1003
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:44,267
while they're still breathing.

1004
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:45,933
You don't do the story
afterwards, you feel me?

1005
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,067
- So by the economy changing
that made it triple hard,

1006
00:46:55,067 --> 00:46:57,067
so if you wasn't on
your beat for real

1007
00:46:57,067 --> 00:46:59,433
or didn't have no knowledge
about getting money,

1008
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,267
you had big problems.

1009
00:47:04,067 --> 00:47:07,767
You got to know how to adjust

1010
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:11,500
to whatever the
situation might be.

1011
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,967
Even if you on top of the world

1012
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:14,900
when you go to
jail and they take

1013
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,067
everything from you, you got
to learn how to adjust to that.

1014
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:23,067
So, everything start from
a mental status point.

1015
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:25,800
And you got to be strong-willed

1016
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,267
in order to handle certain
situations, either or.

1017
00:47:31,067 --> 00:47:33,567
You done brought out a whole
lot of shit about yourself.

1018
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:36,067
But this is what we work for,

1019
00:47:36,067 --> 00:47:39,800
to have fun, to have money,

1020
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:44,767
to have a good time, I invited
all my loved ones here.

1021
00:47:45,267 --> 00:47:47,300
I represent all of my loved one,

1022
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,800
all my friends, all
my pimp friends,

1023
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,433
and all my associates, I'm
representing all of 'em.

1024
00:47:53,633 --> 00:47:56,067
* I keep my boot
in a bitch's ass

1025
00:47:56,067 --> 00:47:59,300
* So no matter what
I do I keep it *

1026
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,500
- [Voiceover] The title
"pimp" started being used in

1027
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,200
the US around the
time slavery ended.

1028
00:48:06,733 --> 00:48:09,600
It was legal to be a
pimp in the Western days.

1029
00:48:09,933 --> 00:48:11,300
Back in those days, the sheriffs

1030
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,700
and the marshals of the towns

1031
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,400
ran the brothels
and the prostitutes.

1032
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,667
They were the biggest
pimps in town.

1033
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:24,300
- Man, I met Virgil
when I was a youngster

1034
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:28,167
and then as I grew
up, he was somebody

1035
00:48:28,167 --> 00:48:30,333
that I admired
and things because

1036
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:32,533
he was a hell of a nigga
out in these streets.

1037
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,567
But now what I want
to say about him,

1038
00:48:35,567 --> 00:48:39,100
when you doing things,
and you doing it legit

1039
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,400
and you getting money legit,

1040
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,833
after you done been
in the game for years,

1041
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:45,233
you got to respect that.

1042
00:48:45,233 --> 00:48:49,267
- I pimped from
the 60s to 2000s,

1043
00:48:49,267 --> 00:48:53,600
for 35 years, I met
Virgil in Fresno,

1044
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:58,067
pimping back in 77, we've
been partners every since.

1045
00:48:58,067 --> 00:49:00,967
Virgil's been a rich man,
ever since I've known him.

1046
00:49:00,967 --> 00:49:03,767
He's been rich in spirit
and rich in the game.

1047
00:49:03,767 --> 00:49:06,133
We all been rich financially,

1048
00:49:06,133 --> 00:49:08,933
but some of us keep
it, some of us don't.

1049
00:49:08,933 --> 00:49:11,833
Virgil's been fortunate
and he's been blessed,

1050
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:14,267
and I wish him much
success in life,

1051
00:49:14,267 --> 00:49:15,900
and may he have
longevity and continue

1052
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,133
to have much success.

1053
00:49:18,567 --> 00:49:22,500
- I don't advise, my
friends ask me all the time

1054
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,267
if I advise any youngsters
to get off into the life,

1055
00:49:25,267 --> 00:49:27,100
I says, "Nah, I
don't advise that."

1056
00:49:27,767 --> 00:49:29,967
Go to school, get educated.

1057
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,433
And that's where all your
money, and your success

1058
00:49:34,433 --> 00:49:36,233
and your future is coming from,

1059
00:49:36,233 --> 00:49:38,333
and I preach that
to all the kids.

1060
00:49:39,467 --> 00:49:41,733
- The smart ones to
me is that they'll

1061
00:49:41,733 --> 00:49:44,067
reach out to a old-school cat

1062
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:45,367
that been in the game
and they can reach

1063
00:49:45,367 --> 00:49:46,967
at them and ask them
for the knowledge

1064
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:50,133
and the old-school cat
would give it to 'em.

1065
00:49:50,133 --> 00:49:52,367
'Cause they see they
trying, they got something

1066
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,733
but they trying to do and they
gone handle they business.

1067
00:49:55,733 --> 00:49:58,100
- I heard a whole bunch of
nice things about you, man.

1068
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,200
Yeah, I'm from
out here too, man.

1069
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:03,267
They told me a whole bunch
of good game about you.

1070
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:05,367
You nice, you look
nice too, man.

1071
00:50:06,233 --> 00:50:07,400
- And he been trying
to get lazy man,

1072
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,533
but now I can't lecture him man.

1073
00:50:10,533 --> 00:50:13,233
- I'm saying though, what's
going on, man, how you it?

1074
00:50:13,233 --> 00:50:14,800
- [Rob] I'm Rob,
his brother, man.

1075
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,000
- How you doing? I know you!

1076
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,400
I've seen you around
here a lot of times.

1077
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,633
- Yeah, yeah man, up
and down the ho stroll,

1078
00:50:19,633 --> 00:50:21,533
that's where you seen me at.

1079
00:50:21,533 --> 00:50:23,633
Touching down for my crown.

1080
00:50:23,633 --> 00:50:25,000
- Three legends right there,

1081
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,533
that's JD, Robert,

1082
00:50:28,533 --> 00:50:30,733
and Virgil, that's
Godfather right there.

1083
00:50:30,733 --> 00:50:32,667
That's the Godfather right
there of almighty right there.

1084
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:34,633
That's why we here, that's
why we here right now.

1085
00:50:34,633 --> 00:50:36,167
Three legends right there.

1086
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:38,267
- [Voiceover] So, tell me how
it was growing up with Virg.

1087
00:50:38,267 --> 00:50:42,033
- Man, it was beautiful.

1088
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:44,100
He taught me everything I know.

1089
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:48,000
If it wasn't for him, it
wouldn't be no (mumbles) in me.

1090
00:50:48,967 --> 00:50:52,633
(chattering)
(laughter)

1091
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:55,167
The tip toes to the
elbows, you know?

1092
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,400
That's how it was.

1093
00:50:59,267 --> 00:51:01,767
He the one put me in
my first Cadillac.

1094
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:05,400
He told me to, "Take off
and go catch you some hos."

1095
00:51:07,733 --> 00:51:09,867
He raised me up
something from Asia

1096
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:12,667
wasn't 16, 17 years old.

1097
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:14,900
You understand me and,

1098
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,967
I graduated from him,

1099
00:51:17,567 --> 00:51:20,733
he clipped my wings,
his whole hope I go.

1100
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:23,900
- This is my friend
Robert here and

1101
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,500
we've been knowing one another

1102
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,367
for about 40 years
and his big brother

1103
00:51:29,367 --> 00:51:33,300
has always been an
inspiration in our lives,

1104
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,533
as we coming up in the game.

1105
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,100
- [Voiceover] Who's
his big brother?

1106
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,133
- Virgil.

1107
00:51:38,133 --> 00:51:40,067
- Real good pimp.

1108
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:46,700
I think a lot of 'em
that's here today

1109
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:49,500
got some of they
pimping from him.

1110
00:51:49,967 --> 00:51:52,167
So, he's an OG pimp.

1111
00:51:52,167 --> 00:51:56,067
The original, do it the
right way, not the wrong way.

1112
00:51:57,067 --> 00:51:58,900
That's what I like about him.

1113
00:51:59,733 --> 00:52:01,500
He don't sell out for a bitch.

1114
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,067
- [Voiceover] Not just a
teacher but a preacher.

1115
00:52:03,067 --> 00:52:04,867
- A preacher, not
just a teacher.

1116
00:52:05,433 --> 00:52:07,567
He don't sell out
for a bitch either.

1117
00:52:08,233 --> 00:52:10,900
He'll run a bitch till her
feet split like deer hooves.

1118
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,133
(laughter)

1119
00:52:12,133 --> 00:52:13,500
- Me and Virg go way,
man, you understand me?

1120
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,900
So, I appreciate this
fella here, much love, man.

1121
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,067
Some of the game I got right
now, that's where it came from.

1122
00:52:18,067 --> 00:52:19,767
Real talk, man.

1123
00:52:20,167 --> 00:52:23,600
That's really real, yeah,
so, that's what it is.

1124
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,767
Real talk, man, love you, man.

1125
00:52:26,767 --> 00:52:28,733
- [Voiceover] How long
you and Virg go back?

1126
00:52:28,733 --> 00:52:29,967
How long you and Virg go back?

1127
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:31,600
- Nigga what? 30?

1128
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,167
- [Virgil] A long
time, 30 years.

1129
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:36,267
- Yeah, man, OGs
from the town, man.

1130
00:52:36,267 --> 00:52:39,267
So, yes, this is
what we do, man.

1131
00:52:39,267 --> 00:52:40,667
I'm just glad to be doing it.

1132
00:52:40,667 --> 00:52:45,667
(chattering)
(laughter)

1133
00:52:52,467 --> 00:52:55,067
- How you doing, man, it's
good to meet you man, a legend.

1134
00:52:56,967 --> 00:53:01,933
(chattering)

1135
00:53:01,933 --> 00:53:04,767
- They call me the poet,
I did a book myself.

1136
00:53:04,767 --> 00:53:06,067
But this is about Virg.

1137
00:53:06,067 --> 00:53:09,467
See man, this guy here,
he's got fortitude, man.

1138
00:53:09,467 --> 00:53:11,567
Let me say this here,
see it's 25 years

1139
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:13,433
to get his mack on wax,

1140
00:53:13,433 --> 00:53:15,633
his planning on lacing us
with these funky track,

1141
00:53:15,633 --> 00:53:17,567
he has time enough to
spit his game back.

1142
00:53:17,567 --> 00:53:19,867
See, you don't get in this
game through an invitation,

1143
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:22,367
this is hard work,
perseverance and dedication.

1144
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:24,800
So all you suckers
better stop your faking,

1145
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,833
'cause he's got big
money (mumbles).

1146
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:29,233
See, the world is here and
it's just for the taking.

1147
00:53:29,233 --> 00:53:31,767
See the game is loaded
and it's non-stop.

1148
00:53:31,767 --> 00:53:34,333
Now it's time to give
a true pimp his props.

1149
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:36,800
True Virgil Fairley,
true pimp, believe that.

1150
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,733
Carvel Rice, straight up poet.

1151
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:42,233
My real partner, you know we
go all the way back to kids.

1152
00:53:42,233 --> 00:53:44,500
From kids, yeah.

1153
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,400
- All the way back from kids--

1154
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,933
- All the way back.

1155
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:48,967
- And he was here through the
whole thing, when it started--

1156
00:53:48,967 --> 00:53:50,233
- When it all started.

1157
00:53:50,233 --> 00:53:52,067
- And to how it is now--

1158
00:53:52,067 --> 00:53:53,567
- He took me along with him.

1159
00:53:53,567 --> 00:53:55,067
(mumbles)

1160
00:53:55,067 --> 00:53:56,833
- If you ain't real with it,
it ain't gone be real with you.

1161
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:59,333
- [Man in Red] It ain't
gone fall unless (mumbles).

1162
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,067
- [Virgil] See, deeds and
actions is what counts.

1163
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:04,200
Conversation don't mean
nothing, all the time.

1164
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,633
Some points it do, but you
got to mean what you say.

1165
00:54:06,633 --> 00:54:08,433
You got to be able to bag it up.

1166
00:54:08,767 --> 00:54:12,067
If you can't bag it up, ain't
no need of stepping up in it.

1167
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,700
- [Man in Red] Or you gone
get slapped on the ass.

1168
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,933
- Every time.

1169
00:54:15,933 --> 00:54:17,100
- [Man in Red] If you
ain't real in the game,

1170
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,133
the game gone slap
you on your ass.

1171
00:54:18,133 --> 00:54:19,533
But then you know, it's good for

1172
00:54:19,533 --> 00:54:20,967
motherfuckers like you
to come back out here

1173
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:23,500
and give little young
motherfuckers like us the game.

1174
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:25,267
I'm 30, I've been
out here in this

1175
00:54:25,267 --> 00:54:26,833
whole west side all my life.

1176
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:28,233
And you don't have motherfuckers

1177
00:54:28,233 --> 00:54:29,467
like that that
come back and give

1178
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:31,067
a motherfucker some good game.

1179
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:32,400
I seen this nigga pull up in a

1180
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,067
motherfucking dream car, nigga,

1181
00:54:34,067 --> 00:54:36,133
give us little niggas
out here motivation.

1182
00:54:36,133 --> 00:54:37,833
- [Virgil] Inspiration!
- [Voiceover] Straight up!

1183
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,400
- I was like that
one time myself.

1184
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,833
And that's where I got it from,

1185
00:54:40,833 --> 00:54:43,900
watching the following G
and so I pass it on down.

1186
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,400
And let them know
it can be done.

1187
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,900
- And then you can't
be weak neither though.

1188
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,433
'Cause you got niggas

1189
00:54:50,433 --> 00:54:52,067

1190
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:54,233

to where you looking for
me, that's just weak game.

1193
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,600
You know what I mean?

1194
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,700
- Just draw a line, say,
"You haters get over there.

1195
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,700
"and let the real
stay over here."

1196
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,533
- Virg, yeah, that
nigga showed me so much

1197
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:11,933
game as a youngster till
it took me over into now.

1198
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,767
- [Voiceover] The nigga
should have been the pope.

1199
00:55:13,767 --> 00:55:17,100
- Well, not the pope,
but the game pope.

1200
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,167
Okay, I can go with
that, Game Pope.

1201
00:55:19,533 --> 00:55:21,200
* Funky fresh from

00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,067

* Now that I'm playing
it's like you quicker to *

1218
00:55:51,533 --> 00:55:53,467
- Me and Virg, I
remember when I was

1219
00:55:53,467 --> 00:55:55,167
down on my luck up
in the Bay area,

1220
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:57,933
and Virg treated me just
like I was still okay.

1221
00:55:57,933 --> 00:55:59,233
You know, so, he
really helped me

1222
00:55:59,233 --> 00:56:01,300
get through that
moment in my life.

1223
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,867
And thank God I'm there,
he was there for me.

1224
00:56:03,867 --> 00:56:08,133
So, I owe my life to
him, I owe him my life.

1225
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:10,967
'Cause I was really struggling
at the time in my life.

1226
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,700
And he was right there with me.

1227
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,067
He told me, "Don't worry
we gone be all right."

1228
00:56:16,067 --> 00:56:17,700
- Virg, I've been
knowing him ever since

1229
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,667
I was about five years old.

1230
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,567
I'm 43 years old.

1231
00:56:21,567 --> 00:56:23,800
Aye, man, all I know
is living legend, man.

1232
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,467
It is what it is, he stand
for everything he say, man.

1233
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,100
You know, everybody see it, man.

1234
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,533
They know what it is, man.

1235
00:56:29,533 --> 00:56:32,500
I ain't got too much to
say but it's for real.

1236
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:34,100
And we are real, man.

1237
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,667
- 'Cause that's all he's
about the business of

1238
00:56:35,667 --> 00:56:38,800
keeping up to keeping on,
that's why I love him.

1239
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,733
Always will.

1240
00:56:40,733 --> 00:56:43,367
- We go way back, we
go way back from kids--

1241
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:46,900
- The year would be 1977.

1242
00:56:47,533 --> 00:56:51,800
And I would say the track

1243
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:56,800
was maybe a two-block radius.

1244
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,900
On the corner was the bar
called, "The Triangle."

1245
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,067
The Triangle Bar, that
was the trick bar.

1246
00:57:03,067 --> 00:57:05,367
That's where everybody
congregated at.

1247
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:07,900
All the hos, all the tricks.

1248
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:11,933
The hotels were like
alongside the street.

1249
00:57:11,933 --> 00:57:16,200
The freeway was
on the other side.

1250
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,233
And it was just this one street.

1251
00:57:18,233 --> 00:57:20,467
One, G Street,

1252
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:24,733
that everybody went down.

1253
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:27,333
It was just one block.

1254
00:57:28,067 --> 00:57:32,067
And it was

1255
00:57:32,067 --> 00:57:34,867
like 20, 30, 40, 50

1256
00:57:34,867 --> 00:57:38,967
hos, pimps riding in and out.

1257
00:57:39,367 --> 00:57:42,733
It was cool, it was
so fucking cool.

1258
00:57:42,733 --> 00:57:44,933
- I was very naughty
and I was out of pocket.

1259
00:57:44,933 --> 00:57:48,167
I was like doing stuff
I didn't supposed to do.

1260
00:57:48,433 --> 00:57:50,233
And he was gonna beat me up.

1261
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,433
And so, I was in
the car with him,

1262
00:57:52,433 --> 00:57:53,867
when we got to a stop sign,

1263
00:57:53,867 --> 00:57:56,500
I jumped out and I
took off running.

1264
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,867
And he had a gopher dude.

1265
00:57:58,867 --> 00:58:01,867
You know, like one of his
lieutenants or something.

1266
00:58:01,867 --> 00:58:04,133
And Virgil was like,
"Chase her, chase her."

1267
00:58:04,133 --> 00:58:06,267
And I was just
running for my life,

1268
00:58:06,267 --> 00:58:07,867
because he was gonna beat me

1269
00:58:07,867 --> 00:58:10,300
because I was doing
some bad stuff.

1270
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,933
- It was in the cut, so
it was just very, very

1271
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,367
very country, just that
square block radius.

1272
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,967
Paid many, many,
many, many pimps,

1273
00:58:24,967 --> 00:58:27,067
and many, many hos.

1274
00:58:27,567 --> 00:58:30,833
And it was just a
money getting town.

1275
00:58:30,833 --> 00:58:32,933
It was a money getting town.

1276
00:58:32,933 --> 00:58:36,067
Cowboys, Mexicans,
truck drivers,

1277
00:58:37,333 --> 00:58:40,400
business men, bankers, lawyers,

1278
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:45,300
doctors, you might date anybody.

1279
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:49,567
And it didn't seem like
we got bothered a lot.

1280
00:58:55,067 --> 00:58:57,067
- So it went all the way down.

1281
00:58:57,067 --> 00:59:00,433
See this is not, back
here was a second part

1282
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:03,567
where the track used to be.

1283
00:59:04,567 --> 00:59:07,400
The original track
started down here.

1284
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,433
This is called Chinatown.

1285
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:20,867
All this corners
provided these streets.

1286
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,367
Hos, ho'ing.

1287
00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:29,733
All down through here.

1288
00:59:35,067 --> 00:59:37,267
When I first got
my first blessing.

1289
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,600
I first started
right up in here.

1290
00:59:44,067 --> 00:59:45,700
That corner where
that guy is standing

1291
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,633
used to be nothing but
hos standing there.

1292
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,933
All around, all
around the corners.

1293
00:59:57,467 --> 01:00:00,167
Where I first sent my
first ho down here.

1294
01:00:07,433 --> 01:00:09,600
Now, it's looking
like ghost town.

1295
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:15,000
* I put my heart
into these songs

1296
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,767
* Really hoping
y'all can feel me

1297
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:19,500
* But they ain't
really like me, no *

1298
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,700
- [Voiceover]
Fresno is the fifth

1299
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,500
largest city in California.

1300
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:26,633
Before World War II, Fresno
had many ethnic neighborhoods.

1301
01:00:26,633 --> 01:00:30,500
In 1940, Fresno's
population, racial make up

1302
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:34,233
was 94% White, 3.3% Black

1303
01:00:34,233 --> 01:00:36,533
and 2.7% Asian.

1304
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:39,433
Road props and orchids gave
way to urban development

1305
01:00:39,433 --> 01:00:42,533
after World War II, the
population of Fresno

1306
01:00:42,533 --> 01:00:45,967
soared in the second
half of the 20th century.

1307
01:00:45,967 --> 01:00:48,167
And entered the ranks
of the 100th largest

1308
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:51,067
United States cities
in 1960 with a

1309
01:00:51,067 --> 01:00:53,600
population of 134,000.

1310
01:00:53,967 --> 01:00:56,167
But now the paychecks
have dried up,

1311
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:59,467
along with the farms,
thanks to cruel,

1312
01:00:59,467 --> 01:01:02,800
confluence of drought,
environmental regulation,

1313
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,667
and years of political neglect.

1314
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:06,733
The air quality is terrible.

1315
01:01:06,733 --> 01:01:09,367
Tap water was hazardous.

1316
01:01:09,367 --> 01:01:12,800
The locals seemed to be
mostly behind the times,

1317
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:15,700
stuck in the ways that
the rest of the country

1318
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:18,067
evolved from decades ago.

1319
01:01:18,067 --> 01:01:21,133
Homelessness and crime
is at an all time high.

1320
01:01:21,133 --> 01:01:22,833
So much that the city of Fresno

1321
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:24,500
declared war on the homeless

1322
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:27,400
and destroyed the only
shelters they had.

1323
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,800
It is been rumored
that land owners

1324
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,067
have set fires to
the homeless shelters

1325
01:01:31,067 --> 01:01:33,167
to force the homeless
from their areas.

1326
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:35,333
- What made me
really respect him,

1327
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:37,767
and know that he was
doing large things,

1328
01:01:37,767 --> 01:01:41,367
he had a house
that he had bought.

1329
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,900
I want to say that
it was between

1330
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:47,900
San Diego and Los
Angeles, in between them.

1331
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,067
And this house was
already laid out,

1332
01:01:50,067 --> 01:01:53,233
TVs, music stereo,
beds, waterbeds,

1333
01:01:53,233 --> 01:01:54,800
the whole nine yards.

1334
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,200
See don't nobody
really remember this

1335
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,633
'cause you know,
you had to really

1336
01:01:57,633 --> 01:01:58,833
be a close friend of his,

1337
01:01:58,833 --> 01:02:01,600
and if you traveled
down the highway,

1338
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,333
and you didn't have room money

1339
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:06,767
or you was close by the house

1340
01:02:06,767 --> 01:02:09,900
or you called Virg,
Virg would tell you

1341
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,067
how to get to the house
and the key stayed

1342
01:02:13,067 --> 01:02:15,400
under the floor mat of the house

1343
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,900
and you go in there and
live as long as you want to,

1344
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,333
as long as you need to,

1345
01:02:19,333 --> 01:02:21,500
and when you leave, after
you clean up the house.

1346
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,633
You put the key
back under the mat,

1347
01:02:23,633 --> 01:02:25,833
and go on about your business.

1348
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:27,933
And kind of like when I saw that

1349
01:02:27,933 --> 01:02:29,600
and heard about it,

1350
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,433
it was kind of like,
wow, that he had a place

1351
01:02:32,433 --> 01:02:34,067
that he didn't even stay.

1352
01:02:34,067 --> 01:02:35,800
I don't know what
he bought it for,

1353
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:36,967
what he did that
for, what was the

1354
01:02:36,967 --> 01:02:38,267
purpose and
understanding for that,

1355
01:02:38,267 --> 01:02:39,967
but it was there for the game

1356
01:02:39,967 --> 01:02:42,900
and a lot of brothers
that knew him,

1357
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:46,600
that went down that
highway stayed there,

1358
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,367
lived there and it was open.

1359
01:02:49,367 --> 01:02:51,300
I mean he ain't
nowhere to be found,

1360
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,700
nowhere around, you
know we could have

1361
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,200
took the TV, the couch,
cleaned the whole house out.

1362
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,900
He was just that
generous of a brother

1363
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,467
that really believed in the game

1364
01:03:01,467 --> 01:03:03,567
like that there and that's what

1365
01:03:03,567 --> 01:03:04,733
stuck out in my mind.

1366
01:03:04,733 --> 01:03:06,700
He done did a lot
of great things,

1367
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,933
but when I saw that,

1368
01:03:08,933 --> 01:03:11,433
it's like the house
was bought for the game

1369
01:03:11,433 --> 01:03:12,900
and he didn't even stay there.

1370
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,200
- I know how this
nigga was breaking hos.

1371
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,167
I was his main nigga.

1372
01:03:18,167 --> 01:03:20,900
I'm going getting these
bitches up out of jail.

1373
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,833
He had this one
bitch that I remember

1374
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:24,833
in particular, man.

1375
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,600
And I called him, I said,

1376
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,367
"V, the bitch is out,
what you want me to do?"

1377
01:03:30,367 --> 01:03:32,267
He said, "Look nigga, the bitch
know her way to the track."

1378
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:34,267
I told the bitch,
"Bitch, you on your own.

1379
01:03:34,267 --> 01:03:36,100
"Go on about your business."

1380
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:39,267
- One year, Virgil
called me and he said,

1381
01:03:39,267 --> 01:03:42,067
"Reggie, you know
what day it is?"

1382
01:03:42,067 --> 01:03:44,433
I said, "Sure, man,
it's Thursday."

1383
01:03:44,433 --> 01:03:47,067
I forgot what the
date was, but I said,

1384
01:03:47,067 --> 01:03:48,300
"It's Thursday, man."

1385
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,833
And he said, "No,
what is today?"

1386
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:52,133
I said, "I just
got off the train,

1387
01:03:52,133 --> 01:03:53,467
"it's Thursday evening, man."

1388
01:03:53,467 --> 01:03:55,533
He said, "Man,
it's my birthday."

1389
01:03:55,533 --> 01:03:57,400
I said," Oh!"

1390
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,633
And we spent our birthdays
together every year.

1391
01:03:59,633 --> 01:04:02,567
He'd come where I'm at
or I'd go where he at.

1392
01:04:02,567 --> 01:04:04,433
So, I said, "Virgil,
I'll be there."

1393
01:04:04,433 --> 01:04:06,400
He said, "Man, how you
gone get here, man?

1394
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,667
"It's 8:00, man, you
can't make it here."

1395
01:04:08,667 --> 01:04:11,500
I said, "I will be there, Virg."

1396
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,067
So, I chartered a plane.

1397
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:16,300
I chartered a plane
and went to Virgil's,

1398
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:17,900
and when I got over his house,

1399
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:21,167
I had one of them (mumbles)
phones in the briefcase.

1400
01:04:21,167 --> 01:04:22,867
And I called Virgil
from the plane.

1401
01:04:22,867 --> 01:04:24,767
I said, "Virgil, I'm up here."

1402
01:04:24,767 --> 01:04:27,267
And Virgil came
outside and brought

1403
01:04:27,267 --> 01:04:28,600
the whole party out
here and looked up.

1404
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,733
I said, "Here I
am, up here, Virg!"

1405
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:32,567
And I'm looking down,
and Virg came on.

1406
01:04:32,567 --> 01:04:34,633
And I could hear him
in the background.

1407
01:04:34,633 --> 01:04:37,067
He said, "That Captain, my
goddamn cousin up there."

1408
01:04:37,067 --> 01:04:38,567
(laughter)

1409
01:04:38,567 --> 01:04:40,333
You know it was real
pimping like that.

1410
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:46,633
- The first arithmetic or
any time I knew how to count

1411
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:48,567
was 'cause the money
he put up under

1412
01:04:48,567 --> 01:04:51,533
my motherfucking mattress,
you know what I'm saying?

1413
01:04:51,533 --> 01:04:53,567
And my mother
wanted to go square.

1414
01:04:53,567 --> 01:04:56,667
And my motherfucking
pops told me

1415
01:04:56,667 --> 01:05:00,167
and my motherfucking momma
and I'm a say it on camera,

1416
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,200
"You quit the game, I didn't."

1417
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,433
(laughter)

1418
01:05:05,433 --> 01:05:07,867
"You wanna quit the
game and do what you do.

1419
01:05:07,867 --> 01:05:09,100
"Hell!"

1420
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:11,733
- The pimps make hos,
man, they can't make us.

1421
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,567
When a bitch run off, you
always got to remember,

1422
01:05:14,267 --> 01:05:16,200
something better can come along.

1423
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:17,433
It was something
wrong with that bitch

1424
01:05:17,433 --> 01:05:18,633
if she wouldn't look up to you.

1425
01:05:18,633 --> 01:05:19,733
Probably been having
trouble with her anyway,

1426
01:05:19,733 --> 01:05:20,967
I know I was.

1427
01:05:20,967 --> 01:05:23,367
You know, let that bitch
get the fuck on, man.

1428
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:25,067
I don't need no headaches.

1429
01:05:25,067 --> 01:05:26,267
And we left and

1430
01:05:27,367 --> 01:05:29,100
went on the highway.

1431
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,800
And when he dropped
me off, I come down

1432
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,067
and he called me, he said,

1433
01:05:32,067 --> 01:05:33,133
"Your bottom bitch
down here ho'ing."

1434
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:34,300
I said, "No she not."

1435
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,633
He said, "Home boy
ain't call you?"

1436
01:05:35,633 --> 01:05:37,067
And he told him, he said,

1437
01:05:37,067 --> 01:05:39,067
"Man, my partners a real
pimp, you need to call him."

1438
01:05:39,067 --> 01:05:40,900
He said, "Well, I know
you got her baby."

1439
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,167
He said he don't give a fuck
about all that, call him.

1440
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,067
When I come down there,
man, he ain't called me yet.

1441
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,433
I see him on G Street
up there by the hotel,

1442
01:05:48,433 --> 01:05:49,867
I mean, by the gas station.

1443
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,333
"Hey man, what's going
on with you, man?

1444
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,933
"That bitch you knocked
me for, man, what's wrong?

1445
01:05:54,933 --> 01:05:57,067
"You don't know how to
serve a motherfucker?"

1446
01:05:57,067 --> 01:06:00,100
"Well man, you know, I
know you got her baby."

1447
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,200
"What has that got to
do with this pimping?"

1448
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:06,067
"Well, I was gone
let you know, man."

1449
01:06:06,067 --> 01:06:10,433
I said, "Listen young man,
late news is no news to me.

1450
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:12,867
"The last time I sent
that bitch out there

1451
01:06:12,867 --> 01:06:14,800
"as far as I know she
was under my instruction

1452
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,967
"and you ain't told
me nothing different.

1453
01:06:16,967 --> 01:06:19,367
"So guess what, that's
why I breaks that bitch."

1454
01:06:19,367 --> 01:06:20,500
Every time I went down there.

1455
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,733
And Virg had to
bail me out of jail.

1456
01:06:21,733 --> 01:06:23,400
I kicked the bitch ass
all up on the ho stroll.

1457
01:06:23,867 --> 01:06:26,067
(laughs) Virg had bailed me out.

1458
01:06:26,067 --> 01:06:27,367
I said, "Virg, I'm in jail."

1459
01:06:27,367 --> 01:06:28,833
I said, "You caused
me, 'cause you told me

1460
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:30,367
"that the bitch was
still down there,

1461
01:06:30,367 --> 01:06:32,133
"and you know I ain't gone let
nobody disrespect like that."

1462
01:06:32,133 --> 01:06:33,867
- [Voiceover] Have you
ever had a nigga tell you

1463
01:06:33,867 --> 01:06:35,667
you wasn't gone accept no news?

1464
01:06:35,667 --> 01:06:37,800
- Oh yeah, oh hell yeah!

1465
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,267
- [Virgil] I done heard that.

1466
01:06:39,267 --> 01:06:40,767
- [Black] I had it happen in
San Jose, where you was at?

1467
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,533
It happened in Texas!

1468
01:06:42,533 --> 01:06:43,700
Them motherfuckers
down there don't

1469
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:44,933
want to accept news either.

1470
01:06:44,933 --> 01:06:46,567
- I said, "No problem.

1471
01:06:46,567 --> 01:06:48,767
"I'll catch you in
Australia then."

1472
01:06:48,767 --> 01:06:51,233
- Yeah, find that bitch.
I hope your money is long.

1473
01:06:51,233 --> 01:06:52,500
- I don't care if you
don't accept no news,

1474
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:53,833
just let me hear about it.

1475
01:06:53,833 --> 01:06:55,900
(laughter)

1476
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:57,500
- Yeah, that bitch told me--

1477
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,200
- No problem.

1478
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,900
- You know, when
we was in San Jose

1479
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:02,300
I knocked this motherfucker for

1480
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,300
hos on Fourth and (mumbles).

1481
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:05,900
She said, "He's a fool."

1482
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,267
And everybody had spoken
pretty rough about him.

1483
01:07:08,267 --> 01:07:09,667
And I said, "Well,
you know what,

1484
01:07:09,667 --> 01:07:11,100
"we're not gone
stay here anyway.

1485
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:12,100
"You think this is
the only motherfucking

1486
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:13,367
"ho stroll that cough money?

1487
01:07:13,367 --> 01:07:15,333
"And then since he's a fool,

1488
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:18,067
"is he fool enough to follow
your ass across state lines?

1489
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:19,367
"Different states?

1490
01:07:19,367 --> 01:07:20,767
"'Cause I don't stay
in no motherfucking

1491
01:07:20,767 --> 01:07:22,400
"one city and one state."

1492
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:25,533
- They come back about
15, 20 years ago.

1493
01:07:25,533 --> 01:07:28,433
I was up in there,
Minnesota on my (mumbles).

1494
01:07:29,533 --> 01:07:32,100
And you know what, I
ain't never had no bad,

1495
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,133
I ain't never heard
no bad word from him.

1496
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:36,200
I ain't never heard
no bad word about him.

1497
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:40,067
He just been a straight
up pimp, especially cool.

1498
01:07:40,067 --> 01:07:41,400
You know what I mean?

1499
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,500
So, I don't know why these cats

1500
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:43,433
running around
here, this cat said,

1501
01:07:43,433 --> 01:07:44,600
"Dude running around hating."

1502
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,133
They hating for
no reason at all,

1503
01:07:47,133 --> 01:07:50,767
'cause Virgil, that's
the man right there.

1504
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,733
- We go back to Fresno
in about a month

1505
01:07:52,733 --> 01:07:54,600
'cause Black need to go.

1506
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:56,633
- I want to go check on my car

1507
01:07:56,633 --> 01:07:58,867
'cause it was in the garage,
it was in the mechanic shop.

1508
01:07:58,867 --> 01:08:00,233
- Check on some of his
business so you know,

1509
01:08:00,233 --> 01:08:01,633
so I let him take the car.

1510
01:08:01,633 --> 01:08:03,533
- One of the cars, he
ain't gone tell you

1511
01:08:03,533 --> 01:08:04,933
what car I took though.

1512
01:08:04,933 --> 01:08:06,567
- Yeah, yeah, he
took one of the cars.

1513
01:08:06,567 --> 01:08:08,067
- I couldn't take
the pretty Seville.

1514
01:08:08,067 --> 01:08:10,067
And I'm glad I didn't,

1515
01:08:10,067 --> 01:08:11,567
'cause I was bugging him too.

1516
01:08:11,567 --> 01:08:12,867
- Yeah, I told him to
take the one he wanted.

1517
01:08:12,867 --> 01:08:14,433
He said, "Well, I'm a
take your other car."

1518
01:08:16,633 --> 01:08:18,200
And I had a black Seville

1519
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:21,133
that I just ordered
out of Beverly Hills.

1520
01:08:21,133 --> 01:08:24,133
- With the phantom top, didn't
nobody even have 'em yet.

1521
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:25,433
He got 'em before they all--

1522
01:08:25,433 --> 01:08:27,767
- One in alike in
the whole country.

1523
01:08:27,767 --> 01:08:30,967
This was just like a 1980, 81.

1524
01:08:30,967 --> 01:08:33,400
So, Black took the car,
I gave him the keys

1525
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,400
and then I took 'em back.

1526
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,767
(laughs)

1527
01:08:35,767 --> 01:08:37,067
And then I said, "You
better take the other car."

1528
01:08:37,067 --> 01:08:38,600
- I'm so glad!

1529
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,867
- So, he took the
other, 15 minutes later

1530
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:42,100
he called me on
the phone and said,

1531
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,800
he done totaled my car out.

1532
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,767
- [Black] All the way out!

1533
01:08:45,767 --> 01:08:47,400
I thought I killed
the po' woman.

1534
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,067
Knocked her all the way
up into a liquor store.

1535
01:08:49,067 --> 01:08:50,533
- I tell Black, "Don't
worry about, man,

1536
01:08:50,533 --> 01:08:52,067
"I'll let that ho, she'll
go buy another one."

1537
01:08:52,067 --> 01:08:53,900
- [Black] You came and
picked me up, remember?

1538
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,733
- I said, "Don't worry about
it, she'll buy another one."

1539
01:08:55,733 --> 01:08:58,567
- He said, "Black, what
you gone do about my car?"

1540
01:08:58,567 --> 01:08:59,900
I said, "Man, you know."

1541
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,100
He said, "You know
what, fuck it!

1542
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:02,067
"We gone charge this
to that ho, man.

1543
01:09:02,067 --> 01:09:03,467
"We gone charge it to a ho."

1544
01:09:03,467 --> 01:09:05,633
I said, "Okay, you gone
charge it to a ho, right?"

1545
01:09:05,633 --> 01:09:07,600
(laughter)

1546
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,067
I've been holding him
to that every time

1547
01:09:09,067 --> 01:09:10,267
because he talking about,
"What we gone do about..."

1548
01:09:10,267 --> 01:09:12,067
"We charged it to
that bitch, man."

1549
01:09:12,067 --> 01:09:13,267
- So every time I
need a deal, I said,

1550
01:09:13,267 --> 01:09:15,700
"You can't tell me nah,"(laughs)

1551
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:16,933
I said, "Remember
you tore my car up?"

1552
01:09:16,933 --> 01:09:18,600
(laughter)

1553
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,467
- [Black] But we
charged it to the bitch.

1554
01:09:20,467 --> 01:09:22,800
- He's a good guy, he's a boss.

1555
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:26,200
If you think about
calling somebody the
boss, he's the boss.

1556
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,467
You know, he's a
big guy in the game.

1557
01:09:28,467 --> 01:09:30,633
Good name, good dude.

1558
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:33,400
- He had so many keys of dope.

1559
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,433
And I seen this dude when I
went to this soda machine.

1560
01:09:36,433 --> 01:09:40,967
And I was like, "Why is this
guy over here at this hotel?"

1561
01:09:40,967 --> 01:09:42,867
So, I went back upstairs
and told Virgil,

1562
01:09:42,867 --> 01:09:44,633
I said, "Virgil, I
think this guy...

1563
01:09:44,633 --> 01:09:46,067
"Something's jumping off."

1564
01:09:46,067 --> 01:09:47,833
I was like, "It's a
set up, something.

1565
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:50,067
"I'm just not feeling
this, Virgil."

1566
01:09:50,067 --> 01:09:53,067
And Virgil was like just
lay down and watch TV.

1567
01:09:53,067 --> 01:09:55,067
So we sitting there
laying down watching TV

1568
01:09:55,067 --> 01:09:57,533
and I'm like, "Virgil,
I'm not feeling this!"

1569
01:09:57,533 --> 01:09:59,767
And so he was like,
"Well, come on."

1570
01:09:59,767 --> 01:10:02,700
So I went the back way, I got
all the dope out the room,

1571
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:04,700
put it in my car
that he bought me,

1572
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,400
took it to my apartment,

1573
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,467
hid it in the room,
came back to the hotel.

1574
01:10:10,467 --> 01:10:12,067
In about three hours later,

1575
01:10:12,067 --> 01:10:13,933
the battle rams came through,

1576
01:10:13,933 --> 01:10:17,033
the news cameras, the police.

1577
01:10:17,033 --> 01:10:19,200
They thought they had Virgil.

1578
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,167
They were looking so stupid.

1579
01:10:21,167 --> 01:10:23,900
They took me to jail
for a 1/8th of weed.

1580
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,333
But they winded
up letting me go,

1581
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:27,933
but it was just
hilarious because

1582
01:10:27,933 --> 01:10:31,800
they thought that they had
Virgil Fairley and they didn't.

1583
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,267
- He was the king at the
city. He was the man.

1584
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,800
Everybody talked
about Virgil from

1585
01:10:41,567 --> 01:10:43,700
Fresno all the way
up to the Bay area,

1586
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:48,033
down to Riverside, Oceanside.

1587
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:53,500
I've heard his name
for years, for years.

1588
01:10:54,133 --> 01:10:56,100
- Virgil is a gentleman.

1589
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,167
He's a gentleman, I know.

1590
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,533
I mean and not only
is he a gentleman,

1591
01:11:00,533 --> 01:11:02,200
he's a stand-up gentleman.

1592
01:11:04,067 --> 01:11:06,433
When you say,
"stand-up gentleman",

1593
01:11:06,433 --> 01:11:09,300
I mean in the
terms of just being

1594
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:13,567
a man with honor and
he has a lot of honor,

1595
01:11:13,567 --> 01:11:16,600
he has a lot of virtue despite

1596
01:11:17,533 --> 01:11:20,267
him being in the game. He does.

1597
01:11:20,267 --> 01:11:22,967
Society per say say
the people in the game,

1598
01:11:22,967 --> 01:11:25,567
that there they're
pimps or what have you,

1599
01:11:25,567 --> 01:11:28,500
that we are somewhat

1600
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,133
underhand because

1601
01:11:31,133 --> 01:11:34,467
we don't work jobs like they say

1602
01:11:34,467 --> 01:11:36,567
we supposed to do and you know,

1603
01:11:36,567 --> 01:11:38,367
we supposed to be the underdogs.

1604
01:11:38,367 --> 01:11:41,233
But that's not true at all.
It's just the opposite.

1605
01:11:41,233 --> 01:11:42,667
But what I want to
say about Virgil,

1606
01:11:42,667 --> 01:11:44,267
Virgil's been such a gentleman.

1607
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:45,900
He's been a role model to me.

1608
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:47,333
- Nothing but inspiration to me.

1609
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:49,067
Nothing but inspiration,
him and my dad,

1610
01:11:49,067 --> 01:11:50,700
nothing but inspiration to me.

1611
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,833
Like I said, you
know, everything I got

1612
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:56,133
come from the game, everything
I got come from the game.

1613
01:11:56,133 --> 01:11:58,733
No loans from the
government, no nothing.

1614
01:11:58,733 --> 01:12:00,567
Every business I opened
come from the game.

1615
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:02,633
Me and this man was
in business together.

1616
01:12:02,633 --> 01:12:04,767
This man is nothing
but an inspiration

1617
01:12:04,767 --> 01:12:07,600
to the game, we need
more players like that

1618
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,567
to stand up and
stay representing.

1619
01:12:10,467 --> 01:12:12,233
To show these young
cats that it's possible

1620
01:12:12,233 --> 01:12:15,533
that you can be successful
coming out the game.

1621
01:12:16,933 --> 01:12:19,567
We take ho money and
turn it into dough money,

1622
01:12:19,567 --> 01:12:22,700
and for sure money
and it's grow money.

1623
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:23,800
You know what I'm saying?

1624
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:24,733
And I got the--

1625
01:12:24,733 --> 01:12:26,233
Come on, give me some, man.

1626
01:12:26,233 --> 01:12:27,967
I appreciate everything,

1627
01:12:27,967 --> 01:12:30,133
I really do I
appreciate everything!

1628
01:12:30,133 --> 01:12:33,333
- His resume, his legacy
is pretty powerful

1629
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:35,733
being able to do the
things that he done,

1630
01:12:35,733 --> 01:12:37,167
even when he went to lay down

1631
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:39,100
and to still come out,
still have things,

1632
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,600
still move forward with it,

1633
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,833
and still in it and
still having things

1634
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:46,733
like a 20 year old,
it's unbelievable

1635
01:12:46,733 --> 01:12:48,067
for a brother that's
still been able to

1636
01:12:48,067 --> 01:12:50,533
put it together the way
he still do it today.

1637
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:51,800
- I've been around
the pimp game.

1638
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,633
I done traveled with the
best and the biggest.

1639
01:12:54,633 --> 01:12:57,167
And I got my game
from Gangsta Brown,

1640
01:12:57,167 --> 01:12:59,400
who got his game
from Filmore Slim.

1641
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,233
And Virgil was a good
part of the family,

1642
01:13:02,233 --> 01:13:04,300
he's a good friend to all of us.

1643
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:06,600
He was always good at inviting
us always to his events,

1644
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,933
always willing to include
us in everything he do,

1645
01:13:08,933 --> 01:13:10,867
good dude, good heart,

1646
01:13:10,867 --> 01:13:12,400
I'm just trying to
keep up with him.

1647
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:15,067
He told me a long to
keep up to catch up.

1648
01:13:15,067 --> 01:13:16,800
So, I caught up now,
I gotta keep up.

1649
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,833
He got that white girl Royce
down there looking real good.

1650
01:13:21,500 --> 01:13:23,067
Much love to ya', Virg.

1651
01:13:23,067 --> 01:13:28,067
- Well, Virgil was a
special, special, person.

1652
01:13:28,067 --> 01:13:30,267
You know, he had a special soul.

1653
01:13:30,267 --> 01:13:32,200
- I've been knowing
him all my life.

1654
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,533
He's been a legend
then and a legend now.

1655
01:13:35,533 --> 01:13:40,267
And I'm honored to give him
this kind of compliment.

1656
01:13:40,733 --> 01:13:41,867
- Virgil from the beginning,

1657
01:13:41,867 --> 01:13:44,300
he's always been an outstanding,

1658
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,833
straight up guy as
far as I'm concerned.

1659
01:13:47,933 --> 01:13:49,733
I have nothing bad to
say about the brother.

1660
01:13:49,733 --> 01:13:51,800
He's been real with it.

1661
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,867
He's been well respected,

1662
01:13:53,867 --> 01:13:55,767
and definitely embraced.

1663
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:59,667
And what I remember
most about Virgil,

1664
01:13:59,667 --> 01:14:03,100
I can recall back on the
time when I first met him.

1665
01:14:05,067 --> 01:14:07,167
It was really on short notice.

1666
01:14:07,167 --> 01:14:10,133
But from the
beginning, I really had

1667
01:14:10,133 --> 01:14:12,800
a real connection with Virgil.

1668
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:14,800
It was just something
about the brother.

1669
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,700
He had that aura about his-self

1670
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:19,100
that really enlightened me.

1671
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:23,067
It wasn't no bullshit with
Virgil, he's just a real dude,

1672
01:14:23,067 --> 01:14:24,267
you know what I mean?

1673
01:14:24,267 --> 01:14:25,633
From what I remember.

1674
01:14:25,633 --> 01:14:28,200
- And I think in retrospect
I should have stayed

1675
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:31,467
because Virgil has been
through a lot of things

1676
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:34,567
and he has survived,
he's a child of the king,

1677
01:14:34,567 --> 01:14:36,633
and I should have
stayed with him,

1678
01:14:36,633 --> 01:14:38,667
because I would have
been more lucrative

1679
01:14:38,667 --> 01:14:40,533
and I had to learn the hard way.

1680
01:14:40,533 --> 01:14:44,333
And you know, live and learn.

1681
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:46,533
- When you niggas
talk all this shit

1682
01:14:46,533 --> 01:14:49,667
about my pops, you
motherfuckers know

1683
01:14:49,667 --> 01:14:52,267
that he did his
motherfucking thing

1684
01:14:52,267 --> 01:14:55,200
on every motherfucking
level it was.

1685
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,733
Because you niggas
talk about "you got to

1686
01:14:56,733 --> 01:14:58,067
be straight laced, no chase."

1687
01:14:58,067 --> 01:15:00,667
You got to pimp the
