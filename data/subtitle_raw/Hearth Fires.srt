1
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,760
-Where are you?

2
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,120
-I'm here.

3
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,520
-Come on now children.

4
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,200
-Get up, and come to have breakfast. 
Your mother is waiting.

5
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,760
-I'll catch her and...
-Yes, I know.

6
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,760
Come, have breakfast.

7
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,760
We have something to tell you.

8
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,120
-I really don't see why we have 
to eat in the living-room

9
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,520
with this tablecloth and these 
dishes for a simple breakfast.

10
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
-It's the last one we're having together.

11
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,080
It's as important as the first one.

12
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,800
-Dad, are we having chocolate?

13
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,120
-Excuse me children, this morning

14
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,560
didn't start too well.

15
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,600
-There you go...

16
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,040
-Your father and I don't 
get along too well anymore.

17
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,280
Well, at least not like before.

18
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,440
So since we hurt each other a lot,

19
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,720
we decided to...

20
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,520
Well, we're leaving each other.

21
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,560
He's leaving this morning.

22
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,320
It's not because of you, that he's leaving,
 it's because of me.

23
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,000
Alexis loves you a lot, 
he will always love you.

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,080
He's a lovely father.

25
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,800
But we've got adult problems.

26
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,720
Love is fragile.

27
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,720
Very difficult.

28
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,000
You have to know that already.

29
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,600
And not too late, as I did.

30
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
-Mom, my chocolate!

31
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,280
-So we won't see you anymore?

32
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,920
-But of course, every day, like before.

33
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,840
I'm keeping my study in the house,
 we will see each other every evening,

34
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,160
we'll talk, have fun...

35
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,720
For you, nothing will change.

36
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,000
I will continue to take care of everything.

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,880
I will give money to your mother.

38
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,600
-I don't want it, I already told you so!
-Don't be ridiculous.

39
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,040
-Since I can't offer you anything any more,

40
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,800
I don't see why you should be taking care of me.

41
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,640
-Think about the kids.
 -I am, that's the point.

42
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,640
-You forgot the butter!

43
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,520
-I'll give private lessons.

44
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,680
-Really? What lessons?

45
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,880
-I have a history degree.

46
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,080
-Strange history... Thanks to you,
 our children know better Khrushchev,

47
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,680
now there's only Napoleon left.

48
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,080
-If I was a man, 
would you respect my ideas?

49
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,240
-Yes, but you are a woman, and a woman 
 should first of all make her husband happy.

50
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,480
-And didn't I make you happy?

51
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,680
-Yes..For a moment...For some hours...

52
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,160
-For a moment? For some hours?

53
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,600
Is that how you summarize twelve 
 years of living together?

54
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,400
-A life that we spent less and less together, no?

55
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,800
I can accept that you refuse going to Sunday mass,
while having an occult relationship with the abbot Bouteiller,

56
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,960
but your public, political opinions
are spectacular... You're a scandal!

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,680
Your fight against the war in Algeria, 
against the law, what does it prove?

58
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,640
It shows that you're not happy with me.

59
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,000
It's well known...When a woman starts dealing
 with politics it means that she's bored.

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
-You really talk like a lawyer.

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,480
-Fifty years ago this lawyer
 would have made you obey.

62
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,560
But times have changed. 
 Now it's the lawyer who leaves.

63
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
-Then leave fast Alexis.

64
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,400
The children don't need any more explanations.
They understood everything.

65
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,480
-It has been a week now

66
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,360
that we said no,

67
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,760
to the 50 additional centimes,

68
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,600
that the company Roubier 
wants to make us pay to go to the factories!

69
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,200
We refused the so-called winter charge,

70
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,400
because it is not the workers

71
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,680
who should pay this increase!

72
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,160
So, for a week now

73
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,040
we have been boycotting the company Roubier,

74
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,480
which means getting up every day,

75
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,520
at four o 'clock in the morning,
 and joining the factory,

76
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,640
which means, going home
 at ten o'clock in the evening,

77
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,720
which means walking at night

78
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,080
30 km's by foot on an icy road,

79
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,440
between -5 and -10 degrees,

80
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,000
which means being brutalised, 
stopped by the police!

81
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,400
So this boycott might seem ridiculous

82
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
to those who don't know

83
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,480
what 50 centimes a day 
represents for a worker!

84
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,000
So the Roubier company has to choose

85
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,760
between the two solutions that remain

86
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,680
either put back the old price

87
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,880
or face our anger!

88
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,120
So commies, are you scared?

89
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
-Pay for your whore of a mother...

90
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,320
Don't worry.

91
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,320
Give this prescribed painkiller to Jean-Paul,

92
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,520
and the aspirin for Laura.

93
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,000
And most of all very hot baths.

94
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,600
In a couple of days they will be fine.
-Thank you.

95
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,080
-Aren't you a little young to do politics?

96
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,760
Stay here, I'll find my way out.

97
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,760
Thank you.

98
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,840
For god's sake, what time is 
your mother going to come home?

99
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,560
-She is surely with the strikers.

100
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,560
-With the strikers?

101
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,880
She should be making dinner.

102
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,600
-Usually she comes home earlier and 
deals with everything.

103
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,800
-Why were you beaten?

104
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,000
-Because mom is brave enough to say the truth.

105
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And there is no one to defend her.

106
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,200
-Jean-Paul!

107
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,160
-Jean-Paul! We have won!

108
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,800
Get out of here.

109
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,360
-I don't understand.

110
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,000
The day that your children are
 massacred for your stupidity,

111
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
you will understand!

112
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,960
-That's enough.

113
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,800
-Look at the children, it is your 
fault they have been beaten.

114
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,080
So no more politics, no more 
 publishing papers, no more unions!

115
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,960
I ask you to do this, at least for their sake.

116
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,680
-It's also for your sake, isn't it?

117
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,680
-Or for my sake.

118
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,040
You don't have any afffection for me do you?

119
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,040
But I still have rights over the children,

120
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,560
and I will insist on keeping them, to the end.

121
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,120
-Am I a monster?
-No.

122
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,240
You are not a monster.

123
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,600
You are too idealistic.

124
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,560
You don't know how to keep order,
 you don't have allies.

125
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,440
-I don't have allies?

126
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,720
Half of the town was with us.

127
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,080
Even abbot Bouteiller!

128
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,920
-Oh poor thing. I can see him from here 
singing the Internationale in his robe.

129
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,680
He will pay dearly.

130
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,000
Lives like others'. Like our children's.

131
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,640
What you would need is a man, a real one.

132
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,640
-And you dad?

133
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,920
-I don't believe so, I don't think 
your mother needs me anymore.

134
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,720
-Why didn't you stop him mother?

135
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,720
-Because he loves another woman.

136
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,600
<i>As time passed our parents 
divorced amicably.</i>

137
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,000
<i>But there was in fact another
 woman in my father's life.</i>

138
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,000
???

139
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,120
<i>My mother, Laura and myself 
continued our life together.</i>

140
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,440
<i>Indians in a reserve, tenderly.</i>

141
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
<i>In the secrecy of happiness.</i>

142
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,600
<i>In ten years, 
 many things have changed.</i>

143
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,000
<i>Laura went to Paris to do 
medical studies</i>

144
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,360
<i>while my mother sank into solitude.</i>

145
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,360
<i>Time passed.</i>

146
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,800
<i> I find myself married.</i>

147
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,480
<i>I work with my father, who 
has kept his study in the house.</i>

148
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,880
<i>However during these ten years 
something stronger than time</i>

149
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,880
<i>stronger than madness, didn't change.</i>

150
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,600
<i>My mother still loves Alexandre.</i>

151
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,120
<i>This morning, February 2nd,</i>

152
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,000
<i>Day of the candlemas,</i>

153
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,680
<i>Mamouchka while opening 
the shutters declared spring.</i>

154
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,600
-Would you be kind enough to take off the hat, 
and take some coffee to Annie?

155
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,440
Like that you you could have coffee
 together while waiting for spring.

156
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
-Well there you go,
 you are also like me.

157
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
You're waiting for spring.

158
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
I'll bring the coffee.

159
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,080
Friday, 5th of February, auction room.

160
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,040
Barberousse city, Atoll.

161
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,280
-Very well. Thank you.

162
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,960
Do you know what time it is?

163
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,120
-Problems with mother.

164
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,600
-Again? What's going on 
with your mother?

165
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,960
-It's the day of the candlemas.

166
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,080
And? I don't see the connection.

167
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,800
-Candlemas. 2nd of February.

168
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,960
-It has been exactly ten years that you left her.

169
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,680
-Yes, it is exactly the anniversary of the day

170
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,160
 that we should rather be forgetting.

171
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,160
Don't you agree?

172
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,080
-For you maybe. But not for her.

173
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,640
Every year this date, it can't go on like this.

174
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,760
Two years ago she wanted to die.

175
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,640
And then the last year,
 her first heart attack.

176
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,000
-Why didn't you tell me earlier?

177
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,520
-You have another wife, 
another household.

178
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
-Everyone has their own responsabilites.

179
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,400
-What's going on?

180
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,920
You let her outside like this?

181
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,000
She declared this morning that it's spring.

182
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,840
Listen, something has to be done.

183
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,120
She can't go to town like this...

184
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,040
-Annie and I tried everything but...

185
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,360
-I'll speak to her...
-No!

186
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,960
-Marie-Louise!

187
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,080
-I would like to speak to you.

188
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,760
-It has been years that we haven't spoken.

189
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,840
-Exactly, years. We have many 
things to say to each other.

190
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,120
-You should put on your overcoat,
 you will catch a cold.

191
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,960
-You are right.

192
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,960
Let's go in my office.

193
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,400
-Well, we're in your stronghold.

194
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,240
Nothing has changed!

195
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,800
But yes, the wallpaper.

196
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,200
It's better.

197
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,680
-You haven't changed either.

198
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,920
-Do you still sit here?

199
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,120
So, Master Boursault.

200
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,600
What are those important
 things you have to say to me?

201
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,040
-Nothing.

202
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,240
Well, actually...

203
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
Laura wrote to me.

204
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,160
She's coming home next week.

205
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
-You know, she wrote to me too.

206
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,000
-Her internship at Saint-Anne is over.

207
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,800
-Not all madmen are peaceful like I am.

208
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,960
I don't understand why people reproach me.

209
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,240
My husband has left me...

210
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,800
and I left politics.

211
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,040
The children are also leaving me little-by-little...

212
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,720
Laura in Paris, Jean-Paul married...

213
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,000
I have the impression 
of being the last survivor.

214
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,440
A ship that repeatedly gets shipwrecked.

215
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,720
-Don't be that pessimistic.

216
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,720
I am here.

217
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,200
It's as good as if you 
were a thousand miles away...

218
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,440
Nevertheless, it's unbelievable...

219
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,160
there are so many people 
who can't bear each other

220
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,520
and still stay together, 
because of conventions, children...

221
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,200
And us, who didn't get along that badly,

222
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,280
we left each other, 
because of the same conventions.

223
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,840
-This cold that never finishes...

224
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,200
Tell me, don't you think
 that this straw hat...

225
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,800
-You don't like it?

226
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
-But yes, a lot.

227
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,120
But you have a fur coat, 
that fits you so much.

228
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,480
-Do you look at me sometimes?

229
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,960
-Of course I do.

230
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,200
You are charming with that fur coat.

231
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,160
Wear it, for my pleasure.

232
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,520
-Really, pleasure?

233
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,800
-Really.

234
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,800
-I thought this morning 
that it was spring.

235
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,760
I wasn't entirely wrong.

236
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,560
-I took his head between my hands,

237
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,760
and then he put his hands on mine...

238
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,240
And we stayed like this for quite a while.

239
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,440
Ten minutes...

240
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,760
One hour...Ten years...

241
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,960
I don't know anymore.

242
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,720
When are you going to
take me dancing?

243
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,560
It has been a while since 
we last enjoyed ourselves like crazy.

244
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,360
Being crazy without enjoying yourself...
It's not funny.

245
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,080
All this!

246
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,040
And this.

247
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Thank you.

248
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,000
Keep the marriage bouquet, 
and deliver me all the rest.

249
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
-She told you 6'o clock, are you sure?
-I'm certain.

250
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,600
-It's starting to snow.

251
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,560
I'll go find her, I'll take the car.
-Wait a little longer...

252
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,760
-You know precisely that 
she has got no sense of time.

253
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,920
-Have you seen your father since?

254
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,200
-Has he spoken to you about...

255
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
about his meeting this morning?

256
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
-Yes.

257
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,840
He hasn't understood a thing. 
Or at least he's pretending.

258
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,600
According to him, Marie-Louise is
 fine, and she is absolutely sane.

259
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,360
It is us who exaggerate, distort...Well, you know.

260
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,480
-She must have forgotten her keys.

261
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,440
-What is this, who is this for?
-It's for Madame Boursault.

262
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,960
-From whom?
-Madame Boursault.

263
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,000
-It seems that we're just exaggerating, 
and Marie-Louise is just fine.

264
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,840
-No, this one's Alexandre's, I recognize it.

265
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,840
-He's only had it for a week now.

266
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,400
It's open.

267
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,960
If it's something for us again...

268
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,960
Oh, you shouldn't have 
waited for me with dinner...

269
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,960
Marc bought be some chestnuts.
-What is it Mamouchka?

270
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,120
-What is it?

271
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,160
-Alexandre is coming home, 
we must prepare his return!

272
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,480
The house should be worthy of him.
 I know Alexandre as the back of my palm.

273
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,840
Oh this is marvellous, it's spring, it's...

274
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,960
Your father hasn't spoken to me for 
eight years now, eight years!

275
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,960
He still loves me, 
he has never stopped loving me!

276
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,880
-Yes, he talked to you, that's true.

277
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,840
He lives with Clotilde. He surely loves her.
-Oh no, she's frigid.

278
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,040
As if someone who plays Mozart on the piano...
 Are they going to have children?

279
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,440
-Mamouchka, you're raving...
-No, I'm seeing clearly!

280
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,160
He married a requiem.

281
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,160
Every time I see that woman on the street,

282
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,600
she's dressed in dark grey, like a grey mouse.

283
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,600
I always wonder who died.

284
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
No, Alexandre is like us.

285
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
He needs sleepless nights.

286
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,040
He is going to come back, I am sure of it.

287
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,000
-Jean-Paul...

288
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,960
How happy I am.

289
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,920
I have never been as happy as...

290
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,840
I have to write to Laura!

291
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,480
She has to know, she has to...

292
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,200
And all this because
 of the red straw hat.

293
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,360
In Nordic countries they always 
light candles at candlemas.

294
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,640
It's a day of hope.

295
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,000
The first for me since ten years ago.

296
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,960
<i>My dear Laura,</i>

297
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,040
<i>Extraordinary things have
 happened this morning.</i>

298
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,080
<i>Something that hasn't 
happened for years now.</i>

299
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,440
<i>Ever since your father has decided to go through
 with his ridiculous marriage with Clotilde.</i>

300
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:08,360
<i>We talked to each other. Him and I.</i>

301
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,720
<i>I took his face between my hands,</i>

302
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
<i>and he held my hands.</i>

303
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,080
<i>Have you noticed 
how beautiful your father is?</i>

304
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,520
<i>I got to know him with dense, brown hair,</i>

305
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,160
<i>that you use to grab 
when you where just a child.</i>

306
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,160
<i>You used to run your
 fingers through his hair and asked,</i>

307
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,160
<i>"Wolf, where are you?"</i>

308
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,120
<i>"I am in the forest."</i>

309
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,240
<i>He replied: "What you touch 
with your fingers is not the forest.</i>

310
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,000
<i>"It is the skin of my wolf head."</i>

311
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
<i>You pretended to be afraid,</i>

312
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,480
<i>and your father told you</i>

313
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,640
<i>"If you are afraid, then you don't love the wolf.</i>

314
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,120
<i>But if you love him,</i>

315
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,200
<i>you don't have to be afraid of him."</i>

316
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,400
<i>Laura, I am happy.</i>

317
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,120
<i>I would do anything so
 that your father speaks to me again.</i>

318
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,400
<i>I would dress up in an even crazier way.</i>

319
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
<i>As a bohemian, as an odelisque,</i>

320
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
<i>as a prostitute, as a man,</i>

321
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,960
<i>as Clotilde...</i>

322
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,880
-Jean-Paul...Jean-Paul!

323
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,920
-My word, we could put this in the basement.

324
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,800
-Come and help me, we'll 
put this back where it belongs.

325
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,440
-Don't you think it would
 be better to go to sleep?

326
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,200
-I want Alexandre to find the same room.

327
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,000
-I'm asking you to come back.

328
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Talk softer.

329
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,240
As if we had anything to hide in front of others.

330
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,240
-Keep quiet!

331
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,560
-Are you afraid?

332
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,080
You even stopped wearing your engagement ring?

333
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,440
-I'm asking you, everyone is watching!

334
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,760
-Then watch closely!

335
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,720
-If he knew how much I've changed...

336
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,720
He would be very surprised.

337
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,400
All the same, I never stopped loving him.

338
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,000
Listen, we are all very tired.
 What if we spoke about this tomorrow...

339
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,320
I don't want you to be miserable.

340
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,320
-Miserable?

341
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,320
I have reached bottom so often,

342
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
nothing worse can happen.

343
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,320
No, I am happy.

344
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,680
-It's 3 o'clock in the morning.

345
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,040
-Jean-Paul...You who knows him well...

346
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,000
He wouldn't have spoken to me,
 just because of a hat?

347
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,360
It's not possible...

348
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,320
Jean-Paul?

349
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,080
You do know that it's 3 o'clock in the morning?

350
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,200
Don't you think that you're exaggerating?

351
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,440
I've almost finished.

352
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,960
This feverish activity that you have
 been recently doing, hides something.

353
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,160
You take every chance to shun me.

354
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,160
Politics included.

355
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,800
-That's true.

356
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,640
Since you took over the office of your father,
 you are suspicious.

357
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,040
You're too immersed in your work.

358
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,920
We pass ten days without
 speaking to each other.

359
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,680
Evidently, I need to do something.

360
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,640
I don't want to feel useless.

361
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,360
I would like to exist.

362
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,160
But apart from that, nothing has changed.

363
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,320
I still love you Alexis.

364
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,840
Doctors,

365
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,840
social system,

366
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,360
even a certain church

367
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,480
are responsible for the death of Yvette Leblanc.

368
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,320
A woman is dead at 30, 
for having refused to have a seventh child.

369
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,080
This death is a crime. -It is not a reason...
-A collective crime!

370
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,640
We don't have the right to stay silent.

371
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,920
-Bad news.

372
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,200
But a logical one.

373
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,880
I have been demoted.

374
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,360
-Bourgeoisie is stronger than us.

375
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,640
-That's not a hat, it's a ???

376
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,840
-And why, don't you like red?

377
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,840
-Marie-Louise!

378
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,240
-You're spending your life destroying mine!

379
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,800
I'm losing clients!

380
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,200
-Do you prefer losing me,
 instead of losing your clients?

381
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,520
-You, always you!

382
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,040
Your office, your clients, your respectability!

383
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,120
This town is rotten to the bone, 
and you say nothing, you approve!

384
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,800
-You're against everything, 
against me, against my job!

385
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,240
I was suggested to leave this town.

386
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,840
<i>Laura, don't ever subordinate
 love to your ideas.</i>

387
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,400
<i>Don't ever be ashamed to feel 
like a woman from head to toes...</i>

388
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,080
-Be realistic, for god's sake, 
you have to cope with other people!

389
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,640
-The others, always the others!

390
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,640
Exteriority, conventions!

391
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,640
Conventions.

392
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,640
<i>Laura especially don't 
commit the same errors I did.</i>

393
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,920
<i>Deep down neither your father, 
nor I failed our duties</i>

394
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,560
<i>But we had our misunderstandings.</i>

395
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,560
<i>What an unfashionable confession.</i>

396
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,360
-We have got to leave each other.

397
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,360
As fast as possible.

398
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,360
I will leave for a while now, I don't know,

399
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,960
I will stay in a hotel.

400
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,960
And in a couple of weeks, 
we'll see what we should do.

401
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,560
I'll give you money.
-Money?

402
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,160
If you leave me, 
we have to go all the way.

403
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,840
As soon as the children wake up, 
we will explain to them.

404
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,400
-What is it Mamouchka?

405
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,320
-Nothing, go back to sleep.

406
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,000
<i>Laura, this is what I decided.</i>

407
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,120
<i>I insist that you meet Marc.</i>

408
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,840
<i>My teacher friend.</i>

409
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,240
<i>My only friend.</i>

410
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,400
<i>He is handsome.</i>

411
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,840
<i>You will like him, I am sure of it.</i>

412
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,760
<i>I need your happiness so badly.</i>

413
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,520
-Jean-Paul!

414
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,680
Tell me about mother 
right away, how is she?

415
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,320
You read her letters, not better, nor worse.

416
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,680
-That is? -It's unbelievable,
 but she is madly in love with Dad.

417
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,040
And not only is she in
 love as one is at age 17,

418
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,040
but she is also sure that he will come back.

419
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,960
This is what they probably call madly in love.

420
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
Something has to be done, to cure her.

421
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,800
What right do we have? 
Based on what?

422
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,440
We can all be cured from the
 first love. But from the last one...

423
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,520
Reason that enters the world of passion.

424
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,560
You see Laura, before you pass a judgement,

425
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,280
you must have loved up to such an extent.

426
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,640
-I will end up thinking
 you're all under her influence.

427
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,640
-That's easy to say from the outside.

428
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,200
I guess, that for you ???

429
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,000
Constant fight of the ill
 between the maternal feeling and

430
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
the frustrated and passionate love, isn't it so?

431
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,240
-If you weren't my brother, I would hate you.

432
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,320
-And if you weren't my sister,
 I couldn't bear you for a second.

433
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,120
-Charming.

434
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,800
No, I didn't come home to get to know this 
Marc Chandois, or Champois as you call him.

435
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,800
-Champenois.
-Yes, Champenois.

436
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,440
-He's a good guy. He became a friend of Mamouchka,
 you see Laura, her friend.

437
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,040
Her friend. A guy who has 
her confidence, and who respects her.

438
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,840
A guy who reconciles her with other people.

439
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,480
-Whatever, I refuse to see him. 
I feel ridiculous.

440
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,560
-I hope that feeling won't replace everything else.

441
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,360
No wait to see mother before judging her, 
 you will hardly recognize her.

442
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,440
-And Dad? How does he take all this?

443
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,640
-Very calmly. At least from the outside.

444
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,680
But he also has changed. He drives faster,
 he leaves his office at 8...

445
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,880
I have the impression 
that he is trying to avoid me.

446
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,720
You know, sometimes I ask myself, whether 
 mom has succeeded in seducing her ex-husband.

447
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,200
One has to admit that he's under siege; 
she writes to him every day, crazy huh?

448
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,160
Every morning at 9, he gets his 
letter, he opens it, reads it,

449
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,160
makes no comment, and
 goes on to the daily routine.

450
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,160
-And Clotilde? Does she know about this?

451
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,600
-No, that's impossible.

452
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,440
-Mamouchka!

453
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,600
-How are you?
-Fine.

454
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,600
-Annie!

455
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,640
-Let me give you a kiss.

456
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,680
-And how about me?

457
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,920
-And me?

458
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,240
And my daughter of course.

459
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,200
-They had a daughter and 
called her Emilie. What a strange idea...

460
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,320
-But no, Emilie is becoming a fashionable name.

461
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,480
-I have a friend, who just had a 
daughter and called her Emilie.

462
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,800
-I also have a story to tell.

463
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,160
The Norois have left town, because 
their son was involved in a drug affair.

464
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,680
-It's not for us to say.

465
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,120
-Do you know who I'm talking about?

466
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,840
-Here's my surprise.

467
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,520
-There's quite a few of us. 
I came for the saturday card game, am I disturbing?

468
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,840
-No not at all, we're 
celebrating the arrival of Laura.

469
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,760
-Good evening.

470
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,760
-Should I have canceled?
-No there is still some nice cake.

471
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,840
-Champenois.
-Good evening.

472
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,280
-Worth mentioning
but rather good, isn't it?

473
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,480
-What is worth mentioning?

474
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,480
-Nothing.

475
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,040
-What courage, to come here at such a time.

476
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,840
-I told you, why didn't you 
tell him that we aren't available?

477
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,520
-Because we are.

478
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,120
-I genuinely support working women.
 For their emancipation.

479
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,120
-You confuse work with freedom.

480
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,360
I think the more a woman works, the less she is free.
She becomes more of a slave.

481
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,320
-But how can one be free 
without working? You also work, don't you?

482
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,920
-Very little. I have four months of payed leave a year.

483
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,120
It's a choice. I don't have ambitions.

484
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,640
I imagine that in Paris one needs ambitions.

485
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,320
No, you shouldn't confuse the relationship 
work-freedom with work-salary.

486
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,240
I believe that women should be payed, even if they don't work, simply for the happiness they give us.

487
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,360
-That's priceless.
-You owe me a fortune.

488
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,080
-No, love is not the communion 
of two exceptional beings.

489
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,920
There's a formidable error ???

490
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,440
-Love, always love, you 
talk too much about it to be able feel it.

491
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,560
-Which means that you know it so well,
 since you don't talk about it?

492
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,480
-Love at Saint-Anne, you know, in a sick person's bed, 
between four white walls...

493
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,240
-I don't know why you react like this, I wrote you letters...

494
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,000
You did read my letters didn't you?

495
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,560
Yes mother, very attentively.

496
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,520
-I don't understand, I asked 
Alexandre to come here during the dessert.

497
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,120
He didn't.

498
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,120
And I realize that he didn't.

499
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,560
-But mother...
-What?

500
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,160
-Obviously, no one believes me.

501
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,400
You refuse to accept the truth.

502
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,960
Alexandre still loves me.

503
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,520
He loves me Laura, do you understand?

504
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,520
-You're the only one who still believes this.

505
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,600
If I'm not wrong, it's been eight years
 since dad last laid his feet in this room.

506
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,360
Excuse me, I don't know
 what I'm saying anymore, I'm tired.

507
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,000
-I'm really sorry.

508
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,800
I never should have started this conversation.

509
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,040
It's not your fault. Laura and 
her mother tend to exaggerate.

510
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,560
They resemble each other so much right now.

511
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,360
-Do you remember Laura?
-What a fuss.

512
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,800
-Good evening.
-Hi.

513
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,800
-Are you coming over?
-Yes.

514
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,800
-Be very nice with Marie-Louise.

515
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,040
-Especially tonight. We were all invited to Alexandre
 and she hasn't got anything to do.

516
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,000
-Yes I know.
-Let's go, we're already very late.

517
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,680
-Do you want me to go with you?
-No, we're going by foot, we're almost there.

518
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,680
-Ok. Bye.
-Bye.

519
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,840
-Come with me.

520
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,240
-Your father has already taken Laura away?

521
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,600
-They must have so many
 things to say to each other. Come inside.

522
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,440
-I suppose that Jean-Paul hasn't been hiding
 things from you during this last week.

523
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,440
Your mother writes to me every day.

524
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,120
He shouldn't have told you.

525
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,840
Well, nevermind.

526
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,200
I wanted to speak to you about this anyway.

527
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,680
-Do you reply to these letters?
-What do you want me to reply?

528
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,920
I'm living with Clotilde now.

529
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,360
And she loves me.
-And you, do you love her?

530
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,720
-Oh, I see what you want me to say.

531
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,240
We only love once, isn't it?

532
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,560
That's true, it's nothing compared
 to what I felt towards your mother.

533
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,360
-What are you planning to do?
-Nothing.

534
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,120
-Absolutely nothing.

535
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,920
-I'm counting on you. We cannot go backwards.

536
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,000
-But she believes so badly 
that you will come back.

537
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,440
-Listen to me Laura, you are the
 only one who can help her

538
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,000
I know, from the way she 
speaks about you in her letters.

539
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,280
She wants your happiness.

540
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,560
-I can see that. Marc.

541
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,560
Always him.

542
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,400
Mom projects onto me a love that she owes him.

543
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,240
-He's the only nice guy who she has 
ever met through abbot Bouteiller.

544
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,560
He feels affection towards her.

545
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:04,440
???

546
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,640
We must win some time.
 Wait for the end of winter.

547
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:16,640
In Marie-Louise's drama 
there is this cold, this iciness,

548
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,800
this snow...

549
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,560
Your mother is a woman of summer.

550
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,200
A woman of the sun.

551
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,360
A woman...

552
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,200
-How is your mother Jean-Paul?

553
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,720
-She's fine.

554
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,320
-I suppose she is glad to see her daughter.

555
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,040
-Yes, she is very happy.

556
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,120
-Excuse me, I have been kidnapped.

557
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,760
If the meal got burnt, at 
least I have someone to blame.

558
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,760
-What do you think about Laura?

559
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,760
A little tired, isn't she?

560
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,760
Yes, she looks like it.

561
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,760
Surely because of Paris.
 And she has lost weight.

562
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,760
-That's true, I need some rest.

563
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,880
-This is quite a good white wine.

564
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,080
-It's quite icy, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.

565
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,760
-By the way...

566
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:19,480
-Actually it's not related, but remind 
me tomorrow to go to the upholsterer at 3.

567
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,720
-Mhm. What time?

568
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,320
-At three.

569
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,680
-Hurry up!

570
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,040
I have a meeting at 13.

571
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,560
-Would you pass me the 
bread please Jean-Paul?

572
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,800
Would you please pass me the bread?

573
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,480
Thank you.

574
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,640
Do you still give piano lessons?

575
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,000
Yes, I do. I've got 5 students currently.

576
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,160
Amongst them there is the
 son of Bertier, who is very talented.

577
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,800
-I even suspect that he is 
in love with his teacher.

578
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,760
-Oh, Alexandre, listen to yourself.

579
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:06,400
-It's quite normal, even I took a 
 liking to piano, thanks to you.

580
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,640
-You know that Bertier's son is only 16.

581
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,640
Or 15 and a half, I'm not sure.

582
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:14,240
Love has got nothing to do with age, 
it can happen at 15 just as well as 40.

583
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,480
-No thank you.
-Really?

584
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,480
-And you Laura?
-No, thank you.

585
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,680
It was delicious.
-Oh, you should eat more.

586
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,000
Look at Annie.

587
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
It's a real pleasure watching her eat.

588
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,960
Excuse me.
-It's OK.

589
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,840
-Does Dabores still work with you?

590
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:45,200
-The housekeeper? She left a month ago.

591
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,200
And you know why? Let me tell you.

592
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,240
She discovered one of my books, a book by Lenin.

593
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,720
She found it on my shelf, 
she read it cover to cover,

594
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,240
I don't know whether she understood a great deal,

595
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,240
but after a week, she comes to me, and says

596
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,760
"Monsieur, I'm leaving, I will become a free woman."

597
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,760
So she perfectly understood.

598
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:07,640
I told her "You're leaving, that's fine,
but what will you do then?"

599
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,640
She says "Then I will be a free woman."

600
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,960
The last news I heard about her is that she's 
cleaning the building of the communist party.

601
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,760
-Hurry!

602
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,480
Where is my raincoat?

603
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:11,360
-Your raincoat? It's in the corridor.

604
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,560
Tidiness is tidiness. 
But it's not allowed in town you know.

605
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,880
Check the kitchen.

606
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,000
-It's unbelievable.
 It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

607
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,600
-Jean-Paul!

608
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,800
I think I'm pregnant.

609
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:56,640
-I found it!

610
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,240
It was in the cold-room.

611
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,480
-Jean-Paul!

612
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,400
-Excuse me, it's because of 
that maid who read Lenin.

613
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,440
Damn it.

614
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,520
-What a surprise! Relax, I'm fine.

615
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,520
What a fiesta children!

616
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,520
Marc cooking, me playing the piano...

617
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,440
Ratatouille Nicoise with some Hallelujah.

618
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,440
Everything mixed.

619
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,880
Soup, religion, cheese, revolution.

620
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,240
And how about you, at Madame Boursault, the second?

621
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,960
Have you exchanged some gossips or lies?

622
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,600
Names, dates?

623
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,360
-No, no, nothing worth mentioning. 
It was a very orderly party.

624
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,960
We only assassinated 
Mozart a little... -I see.

625
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,840
She played ???

626
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:12,440
with elegant nuances... ???

627
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,680
I don't understand Alexandre's fascination
 with these sweeties, who are boring of course.

628
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,840
Well then Laura. How is your father? 
Does he have a good appetite?

629
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,240
And Clotilde? Always well? Always artistic? 
Always as one should be?

630
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,240
-Please mother, please!

631
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,280
-What are you asking me to do? To shut up?

632
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,560
To finally learn how to stay silent?

633
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,040
To give you the proof, 
that I will become sane again?

634
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,680
You expect me not to tell you 
that I was heart-broken all night long?

635
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,960
It is just as well my fault as your father's
 if you are unhappy!

636
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,800
Nevertheless, we still loved
 each other a while ago...

637
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,400
We all loved each other.

638
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,760
What happened to us?

639
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:02,400
Laura, I'm asking you, how is your father?

640
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,680
-He's fine mother. He was 
happy to see me, and look,

641
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,200
he gave me this beautiful bracelet.

642
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,880
-Fifteen years ago he gave me a bracelet 
that looked exactly like this one.

643
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,640
Is it here to remind me, is it a sign, a call?

644
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,280
Laura, giving exactly the same 
bracelet after fifteen years...

645
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,120
can not be an accident.

646
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,840
If I was sure he still loved me, I would...

647
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,880
I would accept everything,
 I wouldn't be alone anymore.

648
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,400
Ask him, whether he still loves me.

649
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,160
I'm feeling better.

650
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,760
This bracelet makes me feel better.

651
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,120
I'm leaving.
-Already?

652
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,240
-Earlier, at Clotilde...

653
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:44,080
you surely haven't heard what I told you.

654
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,400
I'm pregnant.

655
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,520
I told you, I'm pregnant.

656
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,720
Without a doubt.

657
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:00,520
It's official since this afternoon.

658
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,440
-I'm expecting a child.

659
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,200
We're expecting a child.

660
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,280
I don't want to wait 9 months like this.

661
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,800
-What's going on?

662
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,800
-Nothing my love.

663
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,040
-Aren't you expecting a child?

664
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:43,000
*Singing*

665
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,760
-What's going on?
-Come on, Annie is expecting a child.

666
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,840
How happy I am, I am the 
happiest father in the world!

667
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:12,280
-Shall we tell mother?
-Let's go! Mamouchka, Mamouchka!

668
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,000
You are going to be a grandmother.

669
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,840
-Grandmother?

670
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,840
Laura?

671
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,840
-No, Annie!
-Annie is pregnant?

672
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,120
???

673
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,120
-Let me kiss you.

674
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,480
Me too.

675
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,600
I knew alright that it is spring.

676
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,800
-Oh look!

677
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,400
You're so happy together,
 I will take it as a miracle!

678
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,160
What are you going to call this boy?

679
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,840
-This boy?
-It will surely be a boy?

680
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:58,120
-We don't know yet.
-You will call him Alexandre.

681
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,840
After all, it might be a girl.

682
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,840
Then we won't name her anything else but Laura.

683
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,960
Everyone their heritage.

684
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,040
We'll give Laura's dresses to her children.

685
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,520
The Champenois children.

686
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,440
It's terrible that I can't say anything anymore.

687
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:19,920
Look at the face your making.

688
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,320
-I am not in love with anyone 
and most definitely not with Champenois.

689
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,800
-Definitely not? -Look, what if we talked
 about Laura's children another time?

690
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,360
-No, we must talk about it precisely now.

691
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,760
It's easy to say, 
that I'm the one who isn't well.

692
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,200
That I'm the failure, the crazy one.

693
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,800
That I failed my life.

694
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,600
It is true, I failed, Laura.

695
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,440
And you are afraid of 
not succeeding at your own.

696
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,960
You are so afraid of not
 succeeding at your life as a woman.

697
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,960
And it is not easy, believe me.

698
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,680
You refuse Champenois. You turn your back to him
 in advance. Well that's vanity.

699
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:53,440
Meanwhile you try to wear out his enthusiasm 
with your lousy blouses and skirts?

700
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,440
-Stop it! Laura is very beautiful, leave her alone.

701
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,320
-I will be fine Jean-Paul. Go, see to Laura.

702
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,640
-We don't want Mamouchka
 projecting her personal problems onto us.

703
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,520
-She's accusing us of her own weaknesses.
-We musn't leave her alone.

704
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,360
-She must feel very bad that she made me suffer.

705
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,000
Open up Mamouchka.

706
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,640
Mamouchka, I love you.

707
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,880
-How beautiful you are Laura.

708
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:09,520
I will stop saying my crazy ideas.
 I only want your happiness.

709
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,520
-I will be happy, and so will you.

710
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:15,920
Tomorrow, we'll go to town, 
and buy me clothes so that I look pretty.

711
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,520
So that Champenois will like me.

712
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,960
-It's 4 o'clock. I'm hungry.

713
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,960
-How about some pancakes?

714
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,960
-Good idea.

715
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,160
-It's good to realize now.

716
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,160
-Mamouchka, you're really unbearable.

717
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,160
-Every pregnant woman is.

718
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,240
It's a marvellous state.

719
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,720
You're being taken care of, pampered, cuddled...

720
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,720
The whole world is at your feet.

721
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,480
Like two apples.

722
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,640
Mom would like you to be the godfather.

723
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,840
Grandfather and godfather, 
that might be a bit too much, no?

724
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,200
She insists.

725
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:36,160
Your mother is indulgent 
towards Laura at the moment.

726
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,400
No.

727
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,760
No, I decidedly cannot be the
 godfather of your child, I'm sorry.

728
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,480
Can you imagine me standing 
next to the baptismal font?

729
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,160
Anyway, we're divorced.

730
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,120
I'll try to keep distance with your mother.

731
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,600
Champenois is going to fall head over heels
when he sees you. He won't know whom to chose.

732
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,440
It's Laura who is going to fall head over heels. 
Wait until you see the dinner that is awaiting us.

733
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,920
-Nothing broken?
-No, no...

734
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,200
Give me a second, to 
meditate over this fall.

735
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,200
Even if my backside is being kept cold.

736
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:15,200
You see, children,

737
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,640
this fall is the symbol of my whole life.

738
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,920
Marie-Louise Boursault, with her ass on the ground.

739
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,760
Thank god we didn't have to pass in front of Clotilde.

740
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,920
What would I look like, 
Madame Boursault with her buttocks in the snow.

741
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,160
in front of the children from the first bed.

742
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,160
It's a funny expression, "first bed", isn't it?

743
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,720
-Look out.
-Look out, let's not fall over again.

744
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,240
-You see, I'm just joking. I'm much better.

745
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,720
It's great, being able to laugh,

746
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,720
when we fall to the ground.

747
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,720
At 5 degrees below 0.

748
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,480
That's optimistic, isn't it?

749
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,360
-To Annie's baby!

750
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,280
-It's rather strong your punch.
-You have to get drunk from time to time.

751
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:12,920
Especially in the winter.

752
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,920
-Where did you learn how to make couscous?

753
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,920
In jail, in Algeria.

754
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,280
The only book that wasn't 
censured was a cooking book.

755
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,920
I traveled a lot.

756
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,440
The best way to learn about
 a country is through its cuisine.

757
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:26,960
And its women. Here you go Jean-Paul,

758
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,080
Would you serve everyone?

759
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:33,760
This couscous is something I learned 
in Djabel during the Algerian war.

760
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,720
When you are on a rock without trees or 
grass, without any petrol beneath you,

761
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,680
you say to yourself it's pretty stupid to get shot
 for a couple of pebbles under your feet.

762
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,840
You could just as well get 
shot for some couscous, no?

763
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,840
-And you, what did you learn in the army?

764
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,760
-The genius of permissions. 
Would you know something about that?

765
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:53,240
-It's good, having lived a lot of
 things. You learn how to live better.

766
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,920
-By the time one learns 
how to live, it is already too late.

767
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,400
-Oh, I'm sorry.

768
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,440
-Why did you take her off, she was very pretty.

769
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,880
-Personal memories.

770
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,360
-Come on, let's see all your conquests.

771
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,360
The whites, the blacks, the yellows...

772
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:30,000
You said earlier, that women
 taught you more about the world,

773
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,600
than the world itself...
-Did I say that? -Yes.

774
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,520
-That's Monica.

775
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,160
-Monica, who is she?
-The love of his life.

776
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,560
-No, that was my black period.

777
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:46,200
I did inverse racism, I talked 
about <i>"Negritude"</i> and black power.

778
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,520
The result: Monica took to my ideas so much, 
she applied them word by word,

779
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:53,280
that one day, she couldn't
 even bear the sight of a white man, me included.

780
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,320
She was maybe a victim of her liberalism.

781
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,320
-But there is no liberalism, ever.

782
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,680
Violence is everywhere, in every relationship.

783
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:02,680
Class conflict is very common.

784
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,400
One day, a director of a factory,
 who thinks of himself as liberal,

785
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,400
organizes a competition for his workers.

786
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,280
The winner gets the rights to live like 
the director of the factory, for a whole year.

787
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,920
So there is this worker, who during weeks,

788
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,080
months, travels in this Mercedes with a chauffeur,

789
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,400
goes for a weekend in Deauville, bets on horses,

790
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:24,520
passes his time in villas, in baths, 
casinos, he goes hunting... Everything.

791
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:28,640
He goes to the theater, the opera, 
meets all the famous people in the world

792
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,560
and when the one year is over,
 he returns to the factory.

793
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:35,200
He finds himself working in the factory once again,

794
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:40,200
and that same evening, he goes into the office
 of the director with a revolver, and kills him.

795
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,600
Monica hasn't killed Marc, but it's the same.

796
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,760
She couldn't thank you.

797
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,920
-I like you a lot Laura.

798
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,720
-Actually we are all victims of this free world.

799
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,320
-By now I have become tolerant.

800
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:11,200
I accept everything. All sorts of racism, liberation...

801
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:15,880
violence, sexuality, there are no more taboos,
 everyone has to discover themselves.

802
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:20,440
Only in this town, everyone wears masks, 
no one wants to be discovered.

803
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,120
If only we could get drunk.

804
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,360
-To Annie's baby.

805
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:23,240
-Everything is fine Jean-Paul, everything is fine.

806
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:26,040
You've already got a mad mother, a pregnant wife,

807
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,040
and now you have a sister in love.

808
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,400
-Oh, the amount we drank at Marc's place...

809
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,360
What time is it?

810
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:55,040
-Time to kiss me.

811
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,120
-Someone rang, no?
-Just in your head...

812
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,120
You drank too much at Marc's place.

813
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,120
What are you looking for?

814
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,640
-My glasses.

815
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,600
Someone rang the bell.
 Are you expecting anyone?

816
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,120
Good morning children.

817
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,840
-Good morning Mamouchka.

818
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,080
-Did he sleep well?

819
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,640
-You aren't early birds, are you?

820
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:49,600
Well, I missed Laura, and since the weather
 turned worse as I was walking, I came to see her.

821
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,560
I didn't think I would be waking 
you at 3 in the afternoon.

822
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:01,480
Don't bother about me, I will 
talk with Laura here, in this room.

823
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:03,480
-That's out of the question.

824
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,480
You're welcome amongst us Alexis.

825
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,000
I must be disturbing you
 Marie-Louise, excuse me,

826
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,920
I'm here to see Laura.

827
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,480
-Since when does one have to excuse 
themselves for loving their own children?

828
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,480
-Since when does love need an excuse?

829
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,400
-You see, nothing has changed, still a mess, still bohemia.

830
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,040
-Annie! Alexis came to visit us!

831
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,840
Let's go prepare breakfast.

832
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,840
Let's go to the dining room Alexandre.

833
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:36,680
Take a seat.

834
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,280
Do you recognize it? This was your armchair.

835
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:45,080
Jean-Paul is using it now.
-I am happy for the child.

836
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,080
-Eat some jam.

837
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:15,000
I started making orange jam 
since a couple of years ago.

838
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I'm not too hungry, I was silly
 enough to have some lunch.

839
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,520
-Do you like it?

840
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:45,320
-In the old days, you limited
 your cooking to plum jam..

841
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,680
-I am glad, very glad that you visited.

842
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,720
But I know that you didn't 
come for my sake. I'll leave.

843
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,720
I will leave you alone with Laura.

844
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:05,840
-Where are you going mom, stay!
-Marie-Louise!

845
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:14,240
I came to see Laura, of course, but I am happy to see you...all.

846
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:19,880
I see Jean-Paul every day for work related
 reasons, but it has been years since...

847
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,880
I haven't seen my children at home.

848
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,400
I must admit, today I couldn't resist.

849
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,920
It's not only you, who is afraid of winter...

850
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,600
-Yes?
-What was I saying.

851
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,360
Oh yes.

852
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,320
I also came to talk about the 
child who is about to be born.

853
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:50,760
I would like him to help us bury the hatchet.

854
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,200
-You don't hate me anymore?

855
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,960
-I never hated you.

856
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,480
I would like this child to rebalance you. To calm you.

857
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,200
-I haven't been writing to you for the last three days.

858
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,760
I wanted to steal you from Clotilde. What madness.

859
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,360
What vanity.

860
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:27,320
What do you think of Champenois?

861
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:30,320
-Is there any point in talking about Marc?

862
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:34,800
-I think he must be a good guy, a free soul.

863
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,360
-They like each other.

864
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,160
-If you don't mind, I would
 really like to talk about something else.

865
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,560
-Would like to see the house?

866
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,560
Quite a lot has changed.

867
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:51,880
-Happily.

868
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,280
-Why don't you come more often?

869
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,400
This is your house as well.

870
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,360
Crazy, isn't it?

871
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,000
One could spend a lifetime here.

872
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,000
Or even die here.

873
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:07,520
Come on. Follow your guide.

874
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:09,520
We'll visit the royal room.

875
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:11,520
This is the room of love.

876
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,560
Of hell.

877
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,480
???

878
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,120
-Psychopatology.

879
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,120
-Psychoanalysis.

880
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:27,040
-Perversion.
-Hysteria.

881
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,000
All this seems very serious to me. Too serious.

882
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:46,560
-You are looking in vain. Ther is no 
man under that bed. At least for now.

883
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:50,600
-She is becoming more and more intolerable.

884
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,640
-Goodbye.

885
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,440
I have to get going,

886
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:17,080
Clotilde must be waiting for me.

887
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,760
-Alexis, I love you.

888
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,080
-Don't be sad.

889
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,280
It's so obvious that he came because of you.

890
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,280
-He didn't even ask to see my room.

891
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:03,560
-That's because of decency and 
discretion, do you understand?

892
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,480
-It's him!

893
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,440
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

894
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,960
-Alexandre just left.

895
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,240
-Is it the end, or the beginning,
 I don't know anymore.

896
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,840
And you Marc, do you love Laura?

897
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,520
Last night, I thought that you two...

898
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,000
-Well, I actually came to say that...

899
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,880
I'm in love with Laura.

900
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,320
-Oh Laura, how happy I am.

901
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:04,240
If only you could be as happy as I am.

902
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:22,840
<i>We came to a full stop.</i>

903
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,680
<i>Ever since the visit of Alexandre, 
my mother visits the countryside.</i>

904
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:28,440
<i>She goes cycling during the week ???</i>

905
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:31,960
<i>After an imaginary encounter with Alexandre, 
Marie-Louise became once again happy.</i>

906
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,960
<i>She continued hoping for a second honeymoon.</i>

907
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,160
-Everything has to shine for the big return of Alexandre.

908
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,080
<i>Annie ceased to fight.</i>

909
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,600
<i>Her alibi: migraine, sleepiness.</i>

910
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:09,040
<i>Mother, you have to get better.</i>

911
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:12,840
<i>Without that, we will become like 
a slowly sinking ship.</i>

912
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,640
<i>I know we can do it.</i>

913
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:19,120
<i>We are almost ready to throw the bottle in the sea.</i>

914
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,560
<i>I am unhappy, mother.</i>

915
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,600
<i>We are unhappy, Mamouchka.</i>

916
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,600
-Concert in 8 minors, for Alexandre.

917
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,120
First part.

918
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,640
Return of Alexandre.

919
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,000
-Ten o'clock, and she still hasn't arrived.

920
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,280
You really cannot be trusted!
-But Jean-Paul, she is a grown-up!

921
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,880
-I have had enough of this, really!

922
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,920
If you two aren't able to take care of her, 
I will get her locked up!

923
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,920
-Don't talk rubbish!
-It's not rubbish.

924
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,920
I'm saying what everyone is thinking.

925
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,400
I would like you to give birth in peace.

926
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,000
Without any scandals.

927
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,600
-You're talking about scandals, 
and you don't even know where she is,

928
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:03,720
 or what she's doing right now.

929
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,320
-Well, it's not my job to know what she's doing.

930
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,680
You were with her when she left, 
she must have told you something!

931
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,040
-She told me that she was
 going to post a letter, that's all!

932
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,360
-And right now she might just as well be 
throwing cobblestones at Clotilde's window.

933
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,360
-Jean-Paul, you're exaggerating!

934
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:18,880
-No, but I'm not joking, if this goes on like this,

935
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,880
we should really start thinking about a psychiatric hospital.

936
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,800
-It's me.

937
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,760
-Here. What's with the face?

938
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,520
-Hello, Clotilde? It's Jean-Paul.

939
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,800
-Excuse me to disturb you at this hour,
 but I would like to speak with my father.

940
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,360
He hasn't arrived yet.

941
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,960
Don't worry, maybe his car just broke down.

942
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,560
In any case, if he doesn't arrive shortly, 
don't hesitate and call us.

943
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:11,200
No, nothing serious, just a
 small problem in the Fournier case.

944
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,680
Good night.

945
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,800
Do you have your car?
-Yes. -Let's go find her.

946
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:27,920
-Four hours just to post a letter, 
we thought of everything, an accident, a kidnapping!

947
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:29,920
-A kidnapping, at my age?

948
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:34,120
Well, you are not wrong.

949
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:35,840
I was kidnapped.

950
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:40,080
I didn't want to tell you, you would have been worried.

951
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,280
The night was so beautiful.

952
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,280
The sky full of stars...

953
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,480
with some waterfalls,

954
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:55,000
and in the end I met your father.

955
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,000
We walked together...

956
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,560
then we left town...

957
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,840
on the path next to the river with the small shed.

958
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,320
He wanted to take this walk as much as I did.

959
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,160
Your father is coming home.

960
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:19,560
Stop worrying. Winter continues.

961
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,400
But spring is inside me.

962
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:30,080
-Hello?

963
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,920
Jean-Paul? Your father has just arrived.

964
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,560
Were you worried for me?

965
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,760
That's kind. I went to see about this case...

966
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:40,160
Are you dining?

967
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,160
-No, not yet. Mom just arrived.

968
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:45,680
-Well then... Enjoy your meal.

969
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,680
-See you tomorrow.

970
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,080
-What is it?

971
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:00,880
Abbot Bouteiller wrote to me, he wants to 
see me at 9, at the Hotel de France.

972
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:03,000
-What does he want?

973
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,600
-I think mother must have 
sent him a letter, that got him worried.

974
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,720
-I would be grateful if you told me 
what's going on when you arrive home.

975
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,720
-Why are you talking to me like that?
 Do you think I'm enjoying this?

976
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:16,000
Mom must have written an exalted 
letter regarding the engagement of Laura,

977
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
he wants to clear things up.

978
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,640
-You're right.

979
01:23:19,640 --> 01:23:20,920
I haven't thought about that.

980
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,280
-To what do I owe the pleasure?

981
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,280
-I'm afraid this won't be so pleasurable,

982
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,600
but I received a letter from your mother.

983
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,600
And what she says in this letter, is beyond understanding.

984
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:55,040
-You know my mother.

985
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,000
-Yes, but... I don't know her anymore.

986
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,440
That's why I asked you to come.

987
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:02,680
Well...

988
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,320
Your mother has met her 
ex-husband one evening, last week.

989
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,320
Alexandre took her back by car,

990
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,720
and she arrived home at 11 o'clock in the evening.

991
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,280
-I know about this.

992
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:15,560
-But do you also know that she is pregnant?

993
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,880
Well, at least she thinks so.

994
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:23,240
She is at a point where she imagines that meeting
 with her ex-husband for two hours is enough to...

995
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,240
get her pregnant.

996
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:28,640
Your mother is completely losing her mind.

997
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:31,840
She tells herself stories, and 
believes in them so strongly

998
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,840
that all this can become very serious.

999
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:35,720
For everyone.

1000
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,240
For Alexandre's family, yours as well...

1001
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:42,600
and also for Marie-Louise's well-being.

1002
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,600
-She is mad.

1003
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,120
And my father who gets involved
 in this, taking her for a ride...

1004
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,520
He probably just touched her hand at most.

1005
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:54,520
I've had enough of this family.
-Don't get carried away.

1006
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:59,480
You have to reason based on facts.

1007
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:04,440
-What facts? Here are the facts: My father came to 
our house one afternoon to speak to Laura,

1008
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:08,320
then they met, they talked and nothing happened between them.

1009
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,880
-And your father hasn't mentioned this encounter?
-Exactly.

1010
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:17,240
-If I want to know the truth, I have to ask my father.
 Supposing he didn't go mad too.

1011
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:30,920
Dad, I have to speak to you.

1012
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:53,040
-Hello Clotilde. Is my father here?

1013
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,680
-No, isn't he in the study? Come in.

1014
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,120
???

1015
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:04,120
Sit down.
-My mother.

1016
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,360
-I received a letter from her this morning.

1017
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,840
-What did she write in it?

1018
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:17,040
-Things Jean-Paul...Terrible things.

1019
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,160
And strong things.

1020
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:24,880
It's an ultimatum.

1021
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,160
She is asking me to let your
 father return to your house.

1022
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,160
She says that he still loves her.

1023
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,160
And that she is expecting a child.

1024
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:35,080
A child, do you realize?

1025
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,320
Only to hurt me.

1026
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:40,520
Because I didn't have one with Alexandre.
-She's mad.

1027
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,360
She writes to everyone.

1028
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,200
There hasn't been anything going on between Alexandre
 and her for ten years now.

1029
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,320
She has to be cured.
-She has to be put in a house.

1030
01:26:56,240 --> 01:26:58,120
A clinic.

1031
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,160
I know a very good one in Switzerland.

1032
01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:04,120
It's quite expensive, but it's almost like a holiday home.

1033
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:09,200
In any case, Annie has to be spared.

1034
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,800
-Alexandre always loved good food.

1035
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:42,840
-Mom, I have to talk to you right away.

1036
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:45,880
I know about all the letters, to the abbot, 
to Clotilde, this child you're supposed to have...

1037
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:47,680
-What's this Jean-Paul? 
Why are you getting involved?

1038
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,840
-Don't you think about Annie? She's the one pregnant,
 do you want her to have a miscarriage?

1039
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:52,840
-Shut up Jean-Paul, calm down!
-No.

1040
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:55,800
Listen mother, there is no solution,

1041
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:57,920
-Stop seeing dad or whoever,
 or I'll have to get you cured

1042
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,440
whether you want it or not!

1043
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,360
-You still don't believe me,
 that your father still loves me?

1044
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,320
He's coming back Jean-Paul!

1045
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:06,720
And sooner than you think!
-He won't come back! -He will!

1046
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:11,160
This house is his, every furniture, everyone,

1047
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,160
even Annie's child is his!

1048
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:22,680
-I just spoke to my father.

1049
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:27,200
He told me that all this isn't true,
 the child, his return, nothing!

1050
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:29,480
He doesn't understand why you made up all this.

1051
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:31,560
-You spoke to him?

1052
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:34,480
-Just an hour ago.

1053
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:37,840
He even told me that 
he was going to leave this town.

1054
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,840
He's leaving with Clotilde.

1055
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,760
I'm leaving Clotilde Jean-Paul, I'm coming back here.

1056
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:34,080
I'm going to restart my life with
 Marie-Louise, I cannot live without her.
