1
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,442
Morning, Mr Oliver.
- Morning, Joe.

2
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:21,175
Morning, Mr Oliver.
- Morning, Miss Lewis.

3
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:23,998
The dust sheets ought to be
off by now. It's nearly nine.

4
00:01:24,308 --> 00:01:28,091
I've been here since a quarter to.
I can't do it all myself every morning.

5
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,195
Don't tell me Miss Bruce is late again?

6
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:31,603
Yes, Mr Oliver.

7
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:33,607
I shall have to speak to her personally.

8
00:01:35,798 --> 00:01:38,446
These shelves need dusting
underneath as well, Miss Lewis.

9
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:39,744
Yes, Mr Oliver.

10
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:42,074
And some books out of line again here.

11
00:01:42,868 --> 00:01:44,851
I'll put them straight in a minute.

12
00:01:45,418 --> 00:01:47,663
Mr Harman doesn't like to
see that. Better do it now.

13
00:01:50,557 --> 00:01:52,061
Better do it now, Miss Lewis.

14
00:01:57,582 --> 00:01:58,417
Joe.

15
00:01:59,107 --> 00:02:00,079
Yes, Mr Oliver?

16
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:02,245
Did you borrow the
cabinet keys on Saturday?

17
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:04,108
Yes, I did.

18
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,385
Look here.

19
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,452
But wait a minute. I never left them ..
- I must tell Mr Harman about this.

20
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:11,817
But I put those back
on Mr Harman's desk.

21
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:14,335
You mean you usually do
but this time you didn't.

22
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:17,834
You are a lucky boy.

23
00:02:18,142 --> 00:02:20,403
If this one had gone it would
have cost you a lot of money.

24
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:23,430
Look, Mr Oliver. Just because you
had a bad weekend is no reason I ..

25
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:24,947
I beg your pardon?

26
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:28,353
Yes. Thank you very much.
I had a lovely weekend.

27
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:31,445
Mr Quince, better check this cabinet.

28
00:02:31,657 --> 00:02:33,740
Oh dear. Nothing missing, I hope.
- We hope not.

29
00:02:34,032 --> 00:02:34,994
Don't we, Joe?

30
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:38,941
I'm telling you I put those keys back on
Mr Harman's desk. Same as I always do.

31
00:02:39,328 --> 00:02:40,675
Are you calling me a liar?

32
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:42,231
Hello. What's all this?

33
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:45,545
I'm afraid the cabinet keys got
left out over the weekend.

34
00:02:46,205 --> 00:02:48,321
Where were they?
- In that cabinet of all places.

35
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,333
Mr Oliver said ..
- It's alright, Joe.

36
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,583
You're safe this time.
I left them there myself.

37
00:02:52,795 --> 00:02:54,825
Anything missing?
- No. All there, Mr Harmon.

38
00:02:55,273 --> 00:02:56,419
That's alright then.

39
00:02:58,655 --> 00:02:59,334
Well.

40
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,183
I hope that satisfies you.
- Alright. That's enough.

41
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,444
Hello Mary. Have a nice weekend?

42
00:03:28,678 --> 00:03:30,018
Yes thank you, Miss Tracy.

43
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:33,616
Morning, Stella.
- Hello, sir.

44
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:37,047
Good morning, John.

45
00:03:38,243 --> 00:03:39,195
Hello, Stella.

46
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,752
Did you have a nice weekend?
- Yes, thanks.

47
00:03:42,858 --> 00:03:44,210
Well, I have good news.

48
00:03:44,802 --> 00:03:45,433
Oh?

49
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,263
What is it?
- Here you are.

50
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:51,994
Your insurance policy.
- Yes, it's matured at last.

51
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,141
Three hundred and seventy-eight pounds.

52
00:03:54,473 --> 00:03:55,587
And nine shillings.

53
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:59,101
I know what you're going to do with it.
- Yes, things are beginning to move.

54
00:03:59,313 --> 00:04:01,645
Dr Bell is getting in touch
with the Swedish clinic.

55
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:04,987
He thinks May ought to
travel by air ambulance.

56
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:07,630
You'll go with her of course?

57
00:04:07,976 --> 00:04:08,852
Oh yes.

58
00:04:10,232 --> 00:04:12,029
Will it be very expensive?
- No doubt.

59
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:14,934
There will be enough left to take
her somewhere nice to get over it.

60
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:16,357
After that, who cares?

61
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:18,721
She must be terribly excited.
- I know that I am.

62
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:20,312
That reminds me.

63
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:24,536
Do you remember what was written on
my medical report when I left the army?

64
00:04:25,053 --> 00:04:26,989
I should. I was your nurse long enough.

65
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:28,350
What did it say?

66
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:32,364
'Liable to lose control
in emotional situations'.

67
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:35,297
You'd better stand by, Nurse Tracey.

68
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:36,987
Right, Major.

69
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:43,960
Morning, sir. Can I help you?

70
00:04:44,175 --> 00:04:46,100
Yes. I should like to see
some sporting books.

71
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:47,851
This way please. Mr Quince.

72
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:49,629
Here's an order from America.

73
00:04:50,112 --> 00:04:51,294
A big one too.

74
00:04:54,368 --> 00:04:56,444
Arthur's of Boston. A small world.

75
00:04:57,093 --> 00:04:58,624
Do you know them?
- Do I?

76
00:04:59,055 --> 00:05:00,912
I was working there
when the war started.

77
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,080
If it hadn't I'd probably be there now.

78
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:05,009
Mr Harman, Miss Bruce is late again.

79
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:08,062
You know Miss Lewis and Joe really
can't get the shop ready by themselves.

80
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:10,506
Very well. Send her in to me.

81
00:05:10,926 --> 00:05:12,733
Thank you, I feel sure ..
- Stella.

82
00:05:13,155 --> 00:05:14,538
When can we get this off?

83
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,962
I doubt Joe will get them
off before tomorrow night.

84
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,121
That's alright.

85
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:21,280
I can stay late and check them and they
can go out first thing on Wednesday.

86
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:23,446
Warn Joe to stand by, will you.
- Very well.

87
00:05:30,678 --> 00:05:31,352
Joe.

88
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,684
Get ready please.
There's a big order to be collected.

89
00:05:37,025 --> 00:05:38,701
Can I help you?
- Thank you.

90
00:05:38,913 --> 00:05:40,823
I just want to look at
the gardening section.

91
00:05:41,035 --> 00:05:42,117
Over here, please.

92
00:05:50,522 --> 00:05:52,642
I really wanted a book
on mushroom growing.

93
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:54,412
Yes. I think I have one here.

94
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:56,828
Haven't you anything else?

95
00:05:57,675 --> 00:05:58,998
What about this one?

96
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:01,262
Miss Bruce.

97
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:03,510
Do you realize what time it is?

98
00:06:04,193 --> 00:06:06,685
Mr Oliver, the gentleman
is waiting for his book.

99
00:06:07,432 --> 00:06:08,537
I beg your pardon.

100
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:10,754
Mr Harman wants to
see you in his office.

101
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:12,849
I've got to take my coat off first.

102
00:06:15,284 --> 00:06:17,176
I think this is what you wanted.

103
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:28,063
Good morning.
Did you have a nice weekend?

104
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:32,796
Hello. Lunchtime already?

105
00:06:41,305 --> 00:06:42,433
Can I help you, sir?

106
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:44,445
No. I'm just looking around, thanks.

107
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:36,357
I don't want to make a fuss but don't
you think you'd better put it back?

108
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:38,585
What was that?

109
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:40,925
You've taken a book. I saw you.

110
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:42,212
Did you?

111
00:07:45,313 --> 00:07:46,718
I wonder how that got there.

112
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:57,911
There.

113
00:07:58,716 --> 00:08:00,007
Now call the manager.

114
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:00,853
Why?

115
00:08:01,326 --> 00:08:02,653
You've put it back.

116
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:05,713
Very logical. The customer
is always right, eh?

117
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:08,947
But you were going to steal it?
- Was I?

118
00:08:10,138 --> 00:08:12,943
Has anyone told you what
an attractive girl you are?

119
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,920
Am I?
- Lovely.

120
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:16,677
Miss Bruce.

121
00:08:16,923 --> 00:08:19,297
When you finish, will you come in here?
- Yes, Mr Harman.

122
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,266
Miss Bruce, eh?

123
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:23,226
Brenda? Jean?

124
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:25,618
Ruby.
- Ruby.

125
00:08:26,177 --> 00:08:28,896
You know, I like you Ruby.
We can have great fun together.

126
00:08:30,272 --> 00:08:31,314
I've got to go.

127
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:34,202
I'll be at the Blue Club at 8:30
tonight in Orford street.

128
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:35,723
Why not drop in?

129
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,295
I've got better things to do.
- Are you sure?

130
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,516
The Blue Club.

131
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,152
Ask for Jeff Hart.

132
00:08:56,727 --> 00:08:58,396
You wanted to see me, Mr Harman?

133
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:00,018
Yes.

134
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:02,438
Sit down, Miss Bruce.

135
00:09:03,935 --> 00:09:06,175
I hear you were late again this morning.

136
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:09,898
I'm sorry, Mr Harman.
But my train got stuck in a tunnel.

137
00:09:10,476 --> 00:09:12,218
What happened to the train before that?

138
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,173
Did that get stuck as well?

139
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:15,903
I don't know. I wasn't on it.

140
00:09:17,044 --> 00:09:18,546
Was I?
- You should have been.

141
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:22,322
Now see here, young lady.

142
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:25,176
It's one thing to be
late once in a while.

143
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:27,421
But every day?

144
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:30,195
It's not quite fair on the rest of us.

145
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:31,168
Is it?

146
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:32,545
No.

147
00:09:33,684 --> 00:09:35,763
Mr Harman, I beg your pardon.
- Don't go.

148
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,896
Alright, Miss Bruce. Get back to
work and <i>don't</i> be late again.

149
00:09:45,922 --> 00:09:46,901
What is it?

150
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:49,952
I read this Hartley Whitfield over
the weekend by Reg Sanders.

151
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,717
I suggest we take fifty.

152
00:09:52,107 --> 00:09:52,955
Seems a lot.

153
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,766
I think this one will sell alright.
It's certainly up to standard.

154
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:58,514
As a matter of fact there's rather
a novel thrill on the last page.

155
00:09:58,726 --> 00:09:59,360
Oh?

156
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:03,141
A man wants to murder a blackmailer but
can't think how to dispose of the body.

157
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:06,861
Then his next door neighbour suddenly
dies of heart failure very conveniently.

158
00:10:07,244 --> 00:10:10,264
He murders the blackmailer and puts him
in the coffin with the man next door.

159
00:10:11,358 --> 00:10:12,719
Sounds a bit gruesome.

160
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:14,077
Not more than usual.

161
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:17,187
People certainly seem to like that
sort of thing. I can't understand why.

162
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:19,010
Alright. Shall we say fifty?

163
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,245
Very well.

164
00:10:20,617 --> 00:10:22,515
By the way, thanks for
speaking to Miss Bruce.

165
00:10:22,727 --> 00:10:24,844
That's alright.
I'm sure she won't be late again.

166
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:40,853
Hello Ruby. You're right on time.

167
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:43,188
Hello Jeff.
- Come and have a drink.

168
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,685
Have you signed the lady in, sir?
- That's alright.

169
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:47,750
Sorry sir. Police regulations.

170
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,880
What's so regular about this place?

171
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,741
Right. Let's get that drink.

172
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,279
What will you have to drink?

173
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:09,471
I'd like a small gin and orange please.

174
00:11:10,749 --> 00:11:13,165
Do you think I could have a
sandwich? I missed my tea.

175
00:11:13,644 --> 00:11:14,693
Of course. Frank.

176
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:16,109
Yes, sir?

177
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:18,738
I'd like a whiskey and a large
gin and orange, please.

178
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:21,675
And two special grills.
- Two special grills.

179
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:23,341
Mushroom and onions?

180
00:11:23,553 --> 00:11:24,573
No onions.

181
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,018
No onions.

182
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,646
Do you come here often?

183
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,813
Now and again.

184
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,212
One of my friends is a
member of The Sports Club.

185
00:11:38,487 --> 00:11:39,161
Yes?

186
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,755
These are only my shop clothes.
I didn't have time to go home first.

187
00:11:46,937 --> 00:11:49,034
Do you like dancing, Ruby?
- Yes, I do.

188
00:11:49,566 --> 00:11:52,346
We'll give these three time to warm
up and then we'll show them, eh?

189
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:04,773
Jeff.
- Hello, Vi.

190
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:10,517
I didn't know you were back. When did ..
- I'll tell you some other time.

191
00:12:15,753 --> 00:12:16,985
See you, Jeff.

192
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,355
Come on, let's dance.

193
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:25,862
Look Jeff, I've got to
go in a minute or two.

194
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:26,989
Go?

195
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:29,332
You've only just arrived.

196
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:32,127
I didn't have time to tell
my dad I'd be back late.

197
00:12:32,763 --> 00:12:35,680
I must be in by eleven.
He'll raise enough stink as it is.

198
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:38,418
But I'll come tomorrow
Jeff and it will be different.

199
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:40,116
I couldn't care less, honey.

200
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:42,086
If that's how you feel, let's forget it.

201
00:12:42,298 --> 00:12:44,058
Please, Jeff. I don't want to forget it.

202
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,605
Let me come tomorrow.

203
00:12:46,178 --> 00:12:49,506
If I tell my dad first, it won't matter
if I'm not back until one o'clock.

204
00:12:50,115 --> 00:12:52,159
I'll tell him I'm going
to see a girlfriend.

205
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:54,849
Alright Ruby. That's a date then.

206
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,474
After we've had dinner, maybe
we won't worry about dancing.

207
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:01,625
Alright, Jeff.

208
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:04,266
Meet me here at seven then.
Can you make it?

209
00:13:04,478 --> 00:13:05,452
Of course.

210
00:13:10,234 --> 00:13:12,257
Hello? Is that the Blue Club?

211
00:13:13,395 --> 00:13:15,354
I want to leave a message.
Can you take it?

212
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:17,110
It's very urgent.

213
00:13:18,377 --> 00:13:19,006
Yes.

214
00:13:19,335 --> 00:13:23,155
Will you tell Mr Hart I've been
told I have to work late tonight?

215
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,773
Yes. That's right.

216
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,436
I can't meet him until half past eight.

217
00:13:30,218 --> 00:13:31,204
Miss Bruce.

218
00:13:32,922 --> 00:13:34,763
Thanks. Goodbye.

219
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:43,433
[ Whistle ]

220
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,354
Goodnight, Guv.
- Goodnight, Joe.

221
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:28,144
Goodnight, Mr Harman.
- Goodnight.

222
00:14:28,356 --> 00:14:31,303
Yes, the food is excellent.
- I'd love to, Clive. But not tonight.

223
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:33,834
What about a quick drink then?
It's just around the corner.

224
00:14:34,046 --> 00:14:35,838
I'm terribly sorry but I'm late already.

225
00:14:36,534 --> 00:14:38,890
I see. Goodnight Stella.
- Goodnight, Clive.

226
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:40,528
Goodnight.

227
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,116
Any message for May?

228
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:45,754
No. Just tell her I'll
be along about nine.

229
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,396
Thanks for keeping her company.

230
00:14:49,016 --> 00:14:50,356
I'm looking forward to it.

231
00:14:50,716 --> 00:14:52,248
Goodnight Jeff.
- Goodnight.

232
00:15:09,045 --> 00:15:10,160
Ready, Miss Bruce?

233
00:15:28,547 --> 00:15:30,824
I take it you have an
appointment tonight, Miss Bruce?

234
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,379
How did you know?

235
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,950
Well.

236
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:36,922
You look extremely smart and I ..

237
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:39,504
Can't imagine it being for my benefit.

238
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:41,620
I'm glad you like it.

239
00:15:42,753 --> 00:15:44,988
What time are you meeting him?
- Half past eight.

240
00:15:45,252 --> 00:15:48,377
Then we'd better get started.
I check them off and you file them.

241
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:50,224
The invoices?
- On your desk.

242
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:51,341
Thanks.

243
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:09,977
A Short History Of The
British People. Three.

244
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:15,563
Right.

245
00:16:16,038 --> 00:16:17,556
Man In The Making. One.

246
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:24,559
Ouch.

247
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,493
Look at that.

248
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:36,132
What a pity.
- I only bought it today.

249
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:37,958
Can't you mend it?

250
00:16:39,595 --> 00:16:40,677
No. Of course not.

251
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:43,325
I am sorry.

252
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:53,888
I'm sorry.

253
00:16:54,234 --> 00:16:55,764
That was quite ridiculous.

254
00:16:56,525 --> 00:16:57,865
That's alright, Mr Harman.

255
00:16:58,988 --> 00:17:00,619
It was this that started it anyway.

256
00:17:01,256 --> 00:17:02,535
I wish I hadn't torn it.

257
00:17:05,731 --> 00:17:06,405
I ..

258
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:08,563
I only wish I could help.

259
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:10,759
Uh .. how much?

260
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:12,709
How much did it cost?

261
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,987
Oh, about three pounds.

262
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:23,017
Here you are.

263
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,923
Try and get yourself another.
- Thank you.

264
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:31,962
Come on. If you want to get
away we have to hurry.

265
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,055
Now let's see. Where were we? Yes.

266
00:17:34,517 --> 00:17:36,017
Man In The Making. One.

267
00:17:37,881 --> 00:17:38,607
Got it.

268
00:17:41,254 --> 00:17:43,076
You gave me quite a shock last night.

269
00:17:43,977 --> 00:17:45,233
When did you get out?

270
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:46,591
About a month ago.

271
00:17:47,116 --> 00:17:48,012
A month?

272
00:17:48,663 --> 00:17:50,821
Reduction of sentence for good conduct.

273
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:52,552
I'm a good little boy, I am.

274
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:54,741
And now I'm broke.

275
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:58,055
You couldn't lend me a
quid or two could you?

276
00:17:58,267 --> 00:18:00,918
I'd love to, Jack. But I haven't a bean.

277
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:02,168
A pity.

278
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:04,778
Anyway, I thought you were alright.
- What do you mean?

279
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:06,782
Your girlfriend last night.

280
00:18:07,304 --> 00:18:08,062
Oh that?

281
00:18:08,828 --> 00:18:10,043
Nothing, just business.

282
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:10,929
Hmm.

283
00:18:12,515 --> 00:18:14,658
If you're not doing anything
let's go someplace.

284
00:18:14,981 --> 00:18:17,592
I'm sorry, Vi. I can't do that.
I have a fellow to meet here later.

285
00:18:17,804 --> 00:18:19,219
Might be something in it for me.

286
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,188
A job?
- It could be.

287
00:18:21,413 --> 00:18:23,522
Of course, I've to soak him in drink.

288
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:26,448
Are you sure you can't
lend me something?

289
00:18:28,003 --> 00:18:30,348
The things I do for Jeffrey Hart.

290
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,408
Don't say thank you.
It doesn't suit you.

291
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:43,991
Sure you have enough time?
- Yes, Mr Harman. Just nice thanks.

292
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:46,202
Goodnight, Miss Bruce.
Thanks for helping.

293
00:18:46,451 --> 00:18:47,791
That's alright, Mr Harman.

294
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:53,914
Okay, I'll tell him when he comes in.

295
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:56,953
Is Mr Hart here yet?
- Yes, he's in the bar.

296
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,648
He already signed you in.

297
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:01,324
Could look after this for me please?
- Yes, certainly.

298
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:08,953
Ruby.

299
00:19:09,854 --> 00:19:11,840
Sorry I'm late, Jeff.
Did you get my message?

300
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:14,567
Yes, sure. Send over a whisky
and a gin and orange, will you?

301
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,626
Yes, sir.

302
00:19:20,888 --> 00:19:21,905
Is it all fixed?

303
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,475
Yes. My dad doesn't
expect me home until one.

304
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:26,336
That's nice.

305
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:30,441
Oh.
- What's the matter?

306
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:32,784
Sorry, but I tore my sleeve.

307
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:34,577
How did that happen?

308
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:36,458
I had to work late with my boss.

309
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:40,100
I got a bit manhandled.
- Manhandled?

310
00:19:48,714 --> 00:19:51,024
He's never seem me in
my party clothes before.

311
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:53,092
I think the shock was too much for him.

312
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,202
Is ..

313
00:19:54,988 --> 00:19:55,940
Is he married?

314
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:58,258
Yes, he's married.
His wife is an invalid.

315
00:19:58,826 --> 00:19:59,527
Really?

316
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,292
This boss of yours.

317
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,208
What's he get?

318
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:14,978
What do you mean?

319
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:16,723
What's he earn?

320
00:20:17,447 --> 00:20:19,499
How should I know?
I'm only the invoice clerk.

321
00:20:20,443 --> 00:20:21,783
How much money has he got?

322
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:23,896
I shouldn't think very much.

323
00:20:24,854 --> 00:20:25,518
Oh.

324
00:20:25,877 --> 00:20:29,075
Wait a minute. I know he's got some.
I found a letter on his desk.

325
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:30,126
How much?

326
00:20:30,695 --> 00:20:32,704
It was from an insurance company.
- How much?

327
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,802
About three hundred and something.
- Three hundred?

328
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,911
I thought you were a smart girl.

329
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:40,718
Menu, Mr Hart?
- We'll order later.

330
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,110
Very good, sir.

331
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:44,421
Well, I am a smart girl.

332
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:47,838
I got three pounds. More than the
blouse cost and it's not even spoilt.

333
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:50,954
Look. He makes you stay late.

334
00:20:51,636 --> 00:20:52,747
He kisses you.

335
00:20:53,537 --> 00:20:55,416
Right? He tears your blouse.

336
00:20:55,738 --> 00:20:57,843
No. I did that before.
- I think not.

337
00:20:58,379 --> 00:20:59,184
During.

338
00:20:59,713 --> 00:21:02,474
No. You see it was when I passed ..
- Three pounds.

339
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:04,264
How much would you have got?

340
00:21:04,898 --> 00:21:05,833
A hundred.

341
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,347
Not a penny less.

342
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,954
A hundred pounds?
- Why not?

343
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:11,747
He has a job.

344
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:14,696
And a wife. An invalid, you said.

345
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:16,916
He'll pay alright.

346
00:21:17,128 --> 00:21:18,403
Now you are being silly.

347
00:21:19,128 --> 00:21:20,630
I haven't got any proof anyway.

348
00:21:21,286 --> 00:21:23,497
What's a torn blouse?
I did it on a filing cabinet.

349
00:21:24,318 --> 00:21:25,732
Perhaps you're right.

350
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:27,347
It's alright.

351
00:21:28,492 --> 00:21:30,575
Tomorrow you're going to
have a nice big bruise.

352
00:21:31,328 --> 00:21:33,146
No wonder he gave you three pounds.

353
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,822
Miss Bruce. This has happened too often.
Mr Harman wants you in his office.

354
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:50,182
Again?
- Did you hear what I said?

355
00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:53,513
Yes, perfectly. But I'm going
to change my shoes first.

356
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:56,485
We can have the plane on Sunday.
They are checking costs now.

357
00:21:57,808 --> 00:21:58,911
I only hope ..

358
00:21:59,474 --> 00:22:00,807
Hello? Yes?

359
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,208
You'd like it tomorrow?

360
00:22:05,731 --> 00:22:07,488
I could bring cash. Would that help?

361
00:22:08,709 --> 00:22:09,363
Yes.

362
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:12,024
Yes, I'll bring the passport forms too.

363
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:14,080
Thanks very much. Goodbye.

364
00:22:14,853 --> 00:22:15,735
That's that.

365
00:22:15,947 --> 00:22:17,183
Over a hundred pounds.

366
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,475
Now let's see. Plane tickets.

367
00:22:22,096 --> 00:22:23,435
Travellers cheques.

368
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,366
I shall have to cash
more than I thought.

369
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:27,813
Oh. The ambulance.

370
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:29,497
I wonder ..

371
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:31,718
I know what I'll do. I'll cash the lot.

372
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,755
Then, whatever is left over
I can put back. If any.

373
00:22:35,675 --> 00:22:37,123
Will you see Miss Bruce now?

374
00:22:39,854 --> 00:22:40,709
Miss Bruce.

375
00:22:41,253 --> 00:22:43,965
This is the last time I shall
warn you about being late.

376
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,474
I didn't think it would
matter this morning.

377
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,563
After all, I worked late last night.

378
00:22:49,771 --> 00:22:52,750
If you'll excuse me, I have
some things to attend to.

379
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,613
That's no excuse.

380
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,544
I worked late myself last night.

381
00:22:58,956 --> 00:23:00,326
Yes. You did, didn't you.

382
00:23:04,068 --> 00:23:06,385
Do you like this blouse?
I bought it this morning.

383
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:08,780
I am not in the least interested.

384
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,009
I thought you might be.
After all, you paid for it.

385
00:23:20,393 --> 00:23:22,853
I like it better than the
one you tore, don't you?

386
00:23:28,565 --> 00:23:32,855
It was a bit mean fobbing me off with 3
pounds after what happened last night.

387
00:23:34,716 --> 00:23:36,284
I thought I was over-generous.

388
00:23:36,641 --> 00:23:38,266
Oh .. you did, did you?

389
00:23:38,615 --> 00:23:39,697
I didn't think so.

390
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:42,726
You see, I happen to know you
have over three hundred pounds.

391
00:23:43,327 --> 00:23:43,958
So?

392
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:46,263
You read my personal correspondence?

393
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:48,500
You've got to give me a hundred.

394
00:23:50,611 --> 00:23:52,068
If you don't I will ..

395
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,853
I shall tell about what
you did to me last night.

396
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:56,002
Miss Bruce.

397
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:01,036
You could be sent to prison
for saying a thing like that.

398
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,432
I should be very angry with you.

399
00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:07,160
But I'm not.

400
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:10,198
I can't imagine why.

401
00:24:12,349 --> 00:24:15,653
Just because I've lost my matches.
- You needn't try and be funny.

402
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:18,633
You wouldn't think it was funny
if I showed them this, would you?

403
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:19,646
No.

404
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:21,529
That's a nasty bruise.

405
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,497
How did you get it?

406
00:24:24,368 --> 00:24:25,320
Here they are.

407
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:33,689
Better get back to work, Miss Bruce.
You're late enough already.

408
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,272
Sandwich?

409
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:52,919
Well?

410
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:55,432
It wasn't any good.

411
00:24:56,273 --> 00:24:57,991
Did you show him the bruise?

412
00:24:58,376 --> 00:24:59,790
He wasn't interested.

413
00:25:00,014 --> 00:25:01,052
He wasn't, eh?

414
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:02,938
Think again.

415
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:05,097
He was just stalling. That's all.

416
00:25:09,493 --> 00:25:10,554
Now listen, Ruby.

417
00:25:10,972 --> 00:25:12,619
Go back to Harman this afternoon.

418
00:25:13,027 --> 00:25:14,722
It's alright. He'll be expecting you.

419
00:25:15,085 --> 00:25:18,957
Tell him if he doesn't pay you're going
to tell his boss what he did to you.

420
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,448
You mean, write to Mr Pearson?

421
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,210
No Jeff, I couldn't do that.

422
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:26,442
Don't rush ahead so fast, Ruby.
We aren't going to write to Pearson yet.

423
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,632
That wouldn't be at all clever.

424
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:29,666
No.

425
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,348
This is for a letter to Mrs Harman.

426
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:34,527
His wife?

427
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,197
What for?

428
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,428
So he'll believe your
threat about Mr Pearson.

429
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,831
When he believes that,
we get our hundred pounds.

430
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:45,122
Jeff. I couldn't face him again.
- Now look, Ruby.

431
00:25:46,554 --> 00:25:48,185
You've got nothing to be afraid of.

432
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:51,621
We are just going to write
a nice little letter to his wife.

433
00:25:54,174 --> 00:25:56,153
Just to show him we mean business.

434
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,673
I'll soon show you I mean business.

435
00:26:01,514 --> 00:26:03,362
You are very young, Miss Bruce.

436
00:26:03,652 --> 00:26:05,832
I don't think you quite realize
what you are doing.

437
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,788
You don't think I'd dare write
to Mr Pearson do you.

438
00:26:09,107 --> 00:26:10,564
Very well, Miss Bruce.

439
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:13,648
I've had enough of this.

440
00:26:14,251 --> 00:26:15,889
You've just given me an ultimatum.

441
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:17,558
Now I'll give you one.

442
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:21,832
You have until tomorrow to decide that
this affair is finished and over with.

443
00:26:22,405 --> 00:26:24,457
Or you will come with
me to the police station.

444
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,601
Now go and get on with your work.

445
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:29,612
I warn you, mister ..
- Go and get on with your work.

446
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,008
John.

447
00:26:55,595 --> 00:26:58,438
I've written down a list of things
I want for the journey. Here it is.

448
00:26:58,816 --> 00:27:00,770
Stella said she'd help you.
- Alright, dear.

449
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:03,301
We'll manage between us somehow.

450
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,766
Before I forget it.

451
00:27:04,978 --> 00:27:06,544
You must sign this passport form.

452
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:09,082
It's all so exciting.
I can't believe we're going.

453
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:10,769
Neither can I. Just there.

454
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:11,994
[ Door knocks ]

455
00:27:36,344 --> 00:27:37,846
There you are, dear.
- Thanks.

456
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,174
John, don't forget the vicar's books.

457
00:27:40,821 --> 00:27:43,022
The vicar's books? I had forgotten them.

458
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:46,691
I don't think I shall have time.
- Couldn't someone at the shop to do it?

459
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:50,071
He's been so good. He depends
on you for half the book stall.

460
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:51,979
These jumble sales.

461
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:54,509
I'll do the best I can.
When does he want them?

462
00:27:54,721 --> 00:27:56,804
He'll collect them from
here tomorrow afternoon.

463
00:27:58,035 --> 00:28:00,120
In that case I'd better
bring them home tonight.

464
00:28:00,631 --> 00:28:02,568
Maybe Joe can find an
old box or something.

465
00:28:03,338 --> 00:28:06,697
There's lots here we don't want.
The whole of the bottom shelf can go.

466
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:08,638
I can't take those with me now.

467
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,062
Of course not, dear. But you can leave
room in the box and put them in tonight.

468
00:28:13,513 --> 00:28:14,484
Very well then.

469
00:28:14,696 --> 00:28:18,184
Are you so interested in the jumble sale
or do you just want rid of our rubbish?

470
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,114
Both.

471
00:28:19,594 --> 00:28:20,417
I must go.

472
00:28:21,764 --> 00:28:23,677
There. One for you.
- Thank you.

473
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:27,335
Anything else, darling?
- No thanks. I've got all I want.

474
00:28:27,886 --> 00:28:30,490
Goodbye, dear.
I'll be home sharp and on time tonight.

475
00:28:49,998 --> 00:28:52,157
Good morning everybody.
- Good morning, Mr Harman.

476
00:28:52,877 --> 00:28:55,186
I want to see you later, Miss Bruce.
I'll send for you.

477
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,122
Yes, Mr Harman.

478
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,775
Good morning.
- Good morning, Stella.

479
00:29:01,362 --> 00:29:04,574
Mr Oliver, have Joe pack some damaged
stock in a tea chest or something.

480
00:29:05,054 --> 00:29:07,170
I promised them to our vicar.
- I'll see to that.

481
00:29:07,503 --> 00:29:10,200
Ask him to leave plenty of room.
I've got a lot more I want to add.

482
00:29:11,243 --> 00:29:13,031
Anything for me this morning?
I hope not.

483
00:29:13,243 --> 00:29:14,937
We've got this bookbinding contract.

484
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:17,487
Mr Pearson wants your comments
by tomorrow. For sure.

485
00:29:17,699 --> 00:29:19,677
He does? Then I'll attend
to it this afternoon.

486
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:21,746
Off to the bank, then
the airways office.

487
00:29:22,118 --> 00:29:24,750
By the way, do you mind picking
these things up for May sometime?

488
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:26,972
Of course not.
- Be back at eleven.

489
00:29:29,073 --> 00:29:30,607
This one will do very well, Joe.

490
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,277
Put all that lot in. And those.

491
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:36,442
Have a word with Miss Rosetti.
She's bound to have something.

492
00:29:36,897 --> 00:29:38,702
I'll see what else I can find.

493
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:43,730
Hello. Pearson's bookshop.

494
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,514
Yes.

495
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:49,204
I'm afraid Mr Harman
isn't here at the moment.

496
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:51,491
Just a minute.

497
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,612
Miss Tracy. A telephone call
for you. They said it's urgent.

498
00:29:56,186 --> 00:29:56,947
Hello?

499
00:29:58,233 --> 00:29:59,573
Good morning, Doctor Bell.

500
00:30:05,425 --> 00:30:06,372
Out of bed?

501
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:09,094
But she can't even walk.

502
00:30:12,448 --> 00:30:13,497
To burn a letter?

503
00:30:17,246 --> 00:30:17,963
You ..

504
00:30:18,765 --> 00:30:20,135
You mean she's dead?

505
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,363
Who was the letter from?

506
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:27,537
Yes. He'll be back soon.

507
00:30:30,549 --> 00:30:31,310
Right.

508
00:30:32,727 --> 00:30:35,041
I think it would be
better if I told him.

509
00:30:42,442 --> 00:30:45,051
I'll make a note of the title
and order it for you, madam.

510
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,003
Mary.

511
00:31:02,572 --> 00:31:03,942
Would you excuse me?

512
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,846
Will you take care of
this customer please.

513
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,952
I've got the plane tickets.
Spent 120 pounds already.

514
00:31:15,431 --> 00:31:16,961
We leave for certain on Sunday.

515
00:31:17,173 --> 00:31:21,108
If you want to have an early lunch and
get May's shopping, I'll hold the fort.

516
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:22,953
Is something wrong?

517
00:31:27,629 --> 00:31:29,938
I'm afraid this is going to
be a terrible shock to you.

518
00:31:30,562 --> 00:31:31,263
Well?

519
00:31:33,431 --> 00:31:35,554
Dr Bell phoned and ..
- Dr Bell?

520
00:31:36,815 --> 00:31:37,750
About May?

521
00:31:38,513 --> 00:31:39,898
Has something happened?

522
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,904
Mr Harman.

523
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:46,186
I'm afraid she's ..

524
00:31:47,078 --> 00:31:48,115
She's dead.

525
00:31:48,692 --> 00:31:49,410
Dead?

526
00:31:50,464 --> 00:31:51,846
I don't quite understand.

527
00:31:52,469 --> 00:31:56,573
Dr Bell said that Mrs Moss found
her lying on the floor near the fire.

528
00:31:57,131 --> 00:32:00,127
It was something to do with a letter.
She got out of bed to burn it.

529
00:32:02,027 --> 00:32:03,350
Out of bed?
- Yes.

530
00:32:05,147 --> 00:32:06,422
It was too much for her.

531
00:32:10,719 --> 00:32:12,149
Dr Bell is waiting for you.

532
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,386
This ..

533
00:32:15,903 --> 00:32:16,804
This letter.

534
00:32:17,721 --> 00:32:19,103
Did he say who it was from?

535
00:32:19,489 --> 00:32:21,023
No. It was completely destroyed.

536
00:32:21,336 --> 00:32:23,054
Only the envelope was found.

537
00:32:28,622 --> 00:32:30,198
Don't you think you ought to go home?

538
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:32,501
Yes.

539
00:32:33,676 --> 00:32:34,758
Thank you, Stella.

540
00:32:36,203 --> 00:32:37,704
I shall go home presently.

541
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:42,320
Would you like me to come with you?
I'm sure there's something I can do.

542
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,317
No. No thank you, Stella.

543
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,922
I think it's better that
I go home alone.

544
00:32:47,336 --> 00:32:48,564
I shan't come back today.

545
00:32:48,776 --> 00:32:50,504
Will you phone Mr Pearson and explain.

546
00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:52,062
Yes, of course.

547
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,242
Wait a minute.

548
00:32:54,325 --> 00:32:56,258
There was something here ..

549
00:32:57,069 --> 00:32:58,496
He wanted me to do for him.

550
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,150
Yes, the bookbinding contract.

551
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:02,988
He won't expect that now.

552
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,929
Yes, I must do this. I'll come back
tonight when everyone is gone ..

553
00:33:06,677 --> 00:33:08,338
Joe can bring it around tomorrow.

554
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:10,791
Don't come back, John. Not tonight.

555
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,429
Don't you understand?

556
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:15,732
It will give me something
to think about.

557
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:18,250
I couldn't stay in the
house tonight anyway.

558
00:33:19,491 --> 00:33:21,121
I'll probably stay in some hotel.

559
00:33:22,803 --> 00:33:23,434
Oh.

560
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:26,584
I would like to see Miss Bruce.

561
00:33:27,142 --> 00:33:28,201
Before I leave.

562
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:30,225
Miss Bruce?

563
00:33:30,829 --> 00:33:31,503
Yes.

564
00:33:32,534 --> 00:33:33,743
I said I'd see her.

565
00:33:45,974 --> 00:33:46,636
Ruby.

566
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:48,493
Mr Harman wants to see you.

567
00:33:49,922 --> 00:33:53,286
Ruby, you know what's happened.
Please don't say anything to upset him.

568
00:34:11,214 --> 00:34:12,292
Miss Bruce.

569
00:34:13,865 --> 00:34:16,064
Yesterday, when you
said you meant business.

570
00:34:18,445 --> 00:34:19,527
You meant my wife.

571
00:34:20,464 --> 00:34:21,319
Didn't you?

572
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:29,359
That was your letter.

573
00:34:30,336 --> 00:34:31,252
Wasn't it?

574
00:34:33,354 --> 00:34:36,543
I hope you're satisfied with the result.
- Don't. You're hurting me.

575
00:34:39,356 --> 00:34:41,496
For a moment I thought
he was going to kill me.

576
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:44,599
Then he suddenly picked up
his things and went out.

577
00:34:45,626 --> 00:34:47,824
What about the money?
- What do you mean?

578
00:34:48,036 --> 00:34:49,958
The money. The hundred pounds.
Where is it?

579
00:34:50,733 --> 00:34:53,820
I couldn't ask him that. Not after ..
- That's when you should have asked him.

580
00:34:54,628 --> 00:34:57,563
Don't you see you've missed
the best chance you've had?

581
00:34:59,035 --> 00:35:01,251
Where is he now?
- I don't know.

582
00:35:02,092 --> 00:35:04,320
He's probably at the house.
You'd better go there.

583
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:05,644
I can't go there.

584
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,431
Don't you understand? His wife is dead.

585
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,227
I've as good as killed her myself.

586
00:35:12,261 --> 00:35:15,007
Look, Jeff. I never wanted
that money anyway.

587
00:35:15,685 --> 00:35:17,704
If I knew this would
happen, I'd never have ..

588
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:19,323
But it has happened, Ruby.

589
00:35:20,488 --> 00:35:21,473
And as you say.

590
00:35:22,102 --> 00:35:23,830
You've as good as killed her yourself.

591
00:35:24,777 --> 00:35:25,859
Don't forget that.

592
00:35:26,964 --> 00:35:28,464
I haven't done anything.

593
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:31,463
If they ask me .. I know nothing.

594
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:33,297
See what I mean?

595
00:35:34,898 --> 00:35:37,101
Now .. what time will he get home?

596
00:35:37,752 --> 00:35:38,818
I don't know.

597
00:35:43,044 --> 00:35:44,255
He may be at the shop.

598
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:48,091
I think I heard Miss Tracy saying
something about him coming back.

599
00:35:48,475 --> 00:35:49,569
That's better.

600
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:51,478
Now come along.
- Where?

601
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:53,294
To the shop.

602
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,119
Jeff, I can't.

603
00:35:55,793 --> 00:35:58,246
You didn't see the way he looked
at me this morning. He'll hurt me.

604
00:35:58,458 --> 00:35:59,636
What if he does?

605
00:35:59,848 --> 00:36:01,077
All the worse for him.

606
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:03,327
He won't kill you. I will see to that.

607
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:06,142
You'll come with me then?

608
00:36:06,572 --> 00:36:09,157
No. We mustn't be seen together. But ..

609
00:36:09,741 --> 00:36:11,192
I'll be around. Don't worry.

610
00:36:12,001 --> 00:36:14,117
If he tries anything, all
you have to do is yell.

611
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,265
Now come along.

612
00:36:16,894 --> 00:36:18,647
Look, Jeff. It's not worth it.

613
00:36:43,488 --> 00:36:44,473
[ Door knocks ]

614
00:37:06,577 --> 00:37:07,852
What are you doing here?

615
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:10,174
Mr Harman, I've got to see you.

616
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,183
Well .. what is it?

617
00:37:25,624 --> 00:37:27,149
Mr Harman, I want you to know ..

618
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:29,789
If you came to say you're sorry,
you're a little late, Miss Bruce.

619
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,583
I think you'd better go.

620
00:37:32,743 --> 00:37:35,193
Mr Harman, you've got to give
me the hundred pounds.

621
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:38,730
If you don't I'm going to tell
Mr Pearson about what you did to me.

622
00:37:42,045 --> 00:37:44,904
If you'd only given it to me yesterday,
all this wouldn't have happened.

623
00:37:48,449 --> 00:37:50,272
One hundred. Two hundred. There.

624
00:37:50,484 --> 00:37:51,933
Now take the lot and get out!

625
00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:13,716
Here you are, Jeff.

626
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:17,034
Is that all?

627
00:40:17,575 --> 00:40:18,717
Over a hundred.

628
00:40:19,377 --> 00:40:20,999
I said, is that all?

629
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:22,779
Yes.

630
00:40:30,535 --> 00:40:31,699
It's mine, Jeff.

631
00:40:32,744 --> 00:40:35,128
I'm in a bit of a jam.
I've got to have something.

632
00:40:36,577 --> 00:40:37,943
You give me that.
- Shut up.

633
00:40:38,155 --> 00:40:39,423
No, I won't shut up.

634
00:40:51,593 --> 00:40:52,408
Miss Bruce?

635
00:41:05,913 --> 00:41:06,613
Hello?

636
00:41:07,086 --> 00:41:07,978
Miss Bruce?

637
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,948
Alright. You can get up now.

638
00:41:59,582 --> 00:42:00,325
Ruby.

639
00:42:02,128 --> 00:42:02,879
Ruby?

640
00:43:15,016 --> 00:43:17,209
Mr Harman, this is Mr Bruce.
Ruby's father.

641
00:43:17,544 --> 00:43:19,814
How do you do?
- She didn't come home last night.

642
00:43:20,227 --> 00:43:22,380
Oh? Isn't she here?
- No, she's not.

643
00:43:23,487 --> 00:43:24,900
Come in to my office, Mr Bruce.

644
00:43:25,112 --> 00:43:26,775
Where's Joe?
- In the stockroom.

645
00:43:27,177 --> 00:43:29,019
The box is downstairs. Would you mind?

646
00:43:29,392 --> 00:43:30,870
Ask Joe to give him a hand.

647
00:43:31,082 --> 00:43:32,366
Right this way please.

648
00:43:34,407 --> 00:43:36,578
Has she ever done anything
like this before, Mr Bruce?

649
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:37,678
She has not.

650
00:43:38,034 --> 00:43:41,225
When I get my hands on her,
she'll be sorry she's done it this time.

651
00:43:42,262 --> 00:43:44,599
All we can do is let you
know if she comes in.

652
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,399
I reckoned you might give
me something to go on.

653
00:43:50,269 --> 00:43:52,820
How do you mean?
- When did she leave last night?

654
00:43:53,325 --> 00:43:54,977
The usual time. A little after six.

655
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,046
Excuse me. Miss Lewis knows
something that may help Mr Bruce.

656
00:43:59,145 --> 00:44:00,808
Miss Lewis, will you come in please.

657
00:44:06,346 --> 00:44:07,008
Well?

658
00:44:07,751 --> 00:44:11,075
I left with Ruby last night Mr Bruce,
and she did say she had an appointment.

659
00:44:11,393 --> 00:44:12,188
Who with?

660
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,713
I don't know. She just told me she
was meeting a gentleman friend.

661
00:44:16,462 --> 00:44:17,872
Ah, so that's it.

662
00:44:18,494 --> 00:44:20,481
I knew it was something,
being dolled up like that.

663
00:44:20,693 --> 00:44:22,670
She was wearing her
new blouse and gloves.

664
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:24,373
And that barmy umbrella.

665
00:44:26,168 --> 00:44:26,929
She ..

666
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:30,040
Didn't say who this
gentleman was, I suppose?

667
00:44:30,252 --> 00:44:31,709
No. I am afraid not.

668
00:44:32,512 --> 00:44:34,111
Thank you, Miss Lewis. That's all.

669
00:44:42,193 --> 00:44:43,429
Mr Oliver.
- Hmm?

670
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:44,781
Mr Oliver.

671
00:44:45,002 --> 00:44:47,182
Something dreadful has happened.
- Yes? What is it?

672
00:44:48,685 --> 00:44:49,516
What is it?

673
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:53,367
I had an order for six Enid Blytons
and I can't find them anywhere.

674
00:44:53,746 --> 00:44:56,475
They should have gone off yesterday.
- Where did you have them last?

675
00:44:56,857 --> 00:44:59,069
Yesterday afternoon.
- <i>Where</i> did you have them last?

676
00:44:59,815 --> 00:45:01,370
Where? Let me see.

677
00:45:01,881 --> 00:45:03,976
I was talking to
Mr Harman in his office.

678
00:45:04,397 --> 00:45:05,816
Then I took them downstairs.

679
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:08,038
Yes .. I think ..

680
00:45:09,225 --> 00:45:10,483
Yes, I must have done.

681
00:45:12,412 --> 00:45:13,543
Half a mo', chief.

682
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,099
Let's get a better grip.
- Just a minute, Joe.

683
00:45:16,988 --> 00:45:18,821
Blimey, I've slipped
a disc or something.

684
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:22,331
When you packed this yesterday, did you
put in some Enid Blytons by mistake?

685
00:45:22,716 --> 00:45:24,206
A mistake? Me?
- Yes.

686
00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:27,234
You must have done, Joe.
- Better open up and make sure.

687
00:45:27,585 --> 00:45:30,517
Wait a minute. It took me an hour to tie
this up. I never touched any Blytons.

688
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:31,913
Come on. Quickly, Joe.

689
00:45:32,125 --> 00:45:34,162
We'll let you know when
she turns up, Mr Bruce.

690
00:45:34,374 --> 00:45:35,952
I do hope we hear something soon.

691
00:45:36,272 --> 00:45:37,418
I'm getting worried.

692
00:45:37,994 --> 00:45:40,408
I'm going home. There are some
books of my own I want to add.

693
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,314
But ..

694
00:45:41,951 --> 00:45:43,732
Joe. What are you doing?

695
00:45:44,096 --> 00:45:45,873
Miss Rosetti lost some
of her Enid Blytons.

696
00:45:46,085 --> 00:45:47,684
Mr Oliver says ..
- Enid Blytons?

697
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,566
It seems to me I saw them someplace.

698
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:52,136
Yes. She left them on the
small table in my office.

699
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,988
I wondered what they were doing there.

700
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,766
Come on, Joe. The car is waiting.

701
00:45:56,075 --> 00:45:58,236
Will you be back this afternoon?
- Yes, about three.

702
00:45:58,448 --> 00:46:00,195
Can I drop you somewhere?
I go your way.

703
00:46:00,585 --> 00:46:02,118
That's very kind of you, sir.

704
00:46:04,956 --> 00:46:06,409
I wonder where she could be.

705
00:46:07,114 --> 00:46:08,049
Who, Ruby?

706
00:46:08,654 --> 00:46:10,737
She'll be back, if just
to collect her umbrella.

707
00:46:11,546 --> 00:46:12,410
Umbrella?

708
00:46:12,757 --> 00:46:14,058
Together .. heave.

709
00:46:14,529 --> 00:46:15,167
Joe.

710
00:46:16,601 --> 00:46:17,253
Down.

711
00:46:17,465 --> 00:46:18,712
Did you say 'umbrella'?

712
00:46:19,958 --> 00:46:21,626
Yes. She left it behind.

713
00:46:22,129 --> 00:46:24,315
And I put it down by the
side of that bookcase.

714
00:46:24,945 --> 00:46:25,829
Together.

715
00:46:26,687 --> 00:46:27,478
Heave.

716
00:46:34,664 --> 00:46:36,198
So you found your books?
- Yes.

717
00:46:38,321 --> 00:46:40,525
Miss Lewis. Is this
Miss Bruce's umbrella?

718
00:46:40,737 --> 00:46:41,786
Yes. It's Ruby's.

719
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:44,355
You said she had it with her
when she left yesterday.

720
00:46:44,567 --> 00:46:46,984
She must have come back for something.
I'll put it in her locker.

721
00:46:47,196 --> 00:46:47,797
No.

722
00:46:49,169 --> 00:46:50,092
Don't bother.

723
00:47:07,398 --> 00:47:09,061
I wish people would be more careful.

724
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:12,330
Miss Lewis, you told Mr Bruce that Ruby
wore new gloves as she left last night.

725
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:13,967
Yes, that's right.
- These?

726
00:47:14,633 --> 00:47:15,960
It looks like them.

727
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:18,882
See, this is Ruby's too.
- You mean she wore it last night?

728
00:47:19,094 --> 00:47:21,031
Yes. I wonder where the other one is.

729
00:47:21,294 --> 00:47:23,668
Did she have any other shoes here?
- Yes. Her shop shoes.

730
00:47:28,818 --> 00:47:29,611
These?

731
00:47:30,204 --> 00:47:31,024
Yes.

732
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:35,185
Will you ask Miss Tracy to come
down here a moment please?

733
00:48:11,612 --> 00:48:12,803
What is it, Clive?

734
00:48:13,106 --> 00:48:14,773
Stella, I want you to see these.

735
00:48:16,275 --> 00:48:19,264
There's no doubt Ruby was carrying
them when she left the shop last night.

736
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,986
Then she must have come back.
- Yes.

737
00:48:22,587 --> 00:48:24,864
There was no-one here when I left.
How did she get in?

738
00:48:25,185 --> 00:48:28,425
Mr Harman was here later. Perhaps he ..?
- He must have done.

739
00:48:28,654 --> 00:48:30,703
I wonder why he didn't
mention it to her father.

740
00:48:30,915 --> 00:48:32,018
Didn't he?
- No.

741
00:48:32,844 --> 00:48:35,372
He'll be back later this afternoon.
You can ask him about it then.

742
00:48:35,584 --> 00:48:36,389
Stella.

743
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,879
How did Mrs Harman die?
It was very sudden, wasn't it?

744
00:48:41,345 --> 00:48:42,076
Yes.

745
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,151
She got out of bed to burn a letter.
- A letter? Who from?

746
00:48:46,909 --> 00:48:48,346
I haven't the slightest idea.

747
00:48:49,445 --> 00:48:50,430
Why do you ask?

748
00:48:50,748 --> 00:48:52,551
When you broke the
news to him yesterday.

749
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:54,930
Why did he ask to see Ruby
immediately afterwards?

750
00:48:56,177 --> 00:48:58,603
I don't know.
What has that to do with you?

751
00:48:58,993 --> 00:49:00,895
I had to go in the office
while she was there.

752
00:49:01,107 --> 00:49:02,947
He had her by the arm
and was fairly shaking.

753
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,606
I wonder if there's any connection.

754
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,931
What are you talking about?

755
00:49:12,194 --> 00:49:14,706
Joe, that cupboard is for
cleaning materials, not books.

756
00:49:15,709 --> 00:49:16,949
What do you mean?

757
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:20,657
Well, I'll be baffled.

758
00:49:21,232 --> 00:49:22,766
Here, who's been playing tricks?

759
00:49:22,997 --> 00:49:24,237
What's all this?

760
00:49:28,554 --> 00:49:30,517
These are the books
Joe packed in that box.

761
00:49:31,108 --> 00:49:32,739
And now they're in there.

762
00:49:33,563 --> 00:49:34,982
What<i> was </i>in the box?

763
00:49:40,535 --> 00:49:41,747
Where are you going?

764
00:49:42,555 --> 00:49:43,863
To the police, of course.

765
00:49:44,143 --> 00:49:46,680
The police? Why?
Why not wait until Mr Harman gets back?

766
00:49:47,071 --> 00:49:49,031
You think he will?
When is Mrs Harman's funeral?

767
00:49:49,243 --> 00:49:50,486
Tomorrow, I think. Why?

768
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:51,684
Tomorrow?

769
00:50:07,731 --> 00:50:09,166
This is the shoe, Inspector.

770
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:11,644
There are the books.

771
00:50:12,447 --> 00:50:14,160
And this is where the box was.

772
00:50:23,878 --> 00:50:25,118
Is this hers too?

773
00:50:25,608 --> 00:50:26,264
Yes.

774
00:50:28,433 --> 00:50:29,832
Where's the telephone?

775
00:50:30,044 --> 00:50:31,110
Through here.

776
00:50:37,629 --> 00:50:38,612
Excuse me.

777
00:50:40,474 --> 00:50:41,409
Excuse me.

778
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:44,383
Close the shop.

779
00:50:44,597 --> 00:50:46,750
Close the shop.
- That's what I said.

780
00:50:54,923 --> 00:50:57,146
Hello, Lang. Chief Inspector Dale here.

781
00:50:57,626 --> 00:50:59,106
Get on to Central Information.

782

Ask them to send out an urgent
message to locate this person.

[ Door knocks ]

787
00:52:23,605 --> 00:52:25,794
Now, about this letter that
was sent to Mrs Harman.

788
00:52:26,458 --> 00:52:28,393
Could Miss Bruce have written it?

789
00:52:30,127 --> 00:52:32,652
I suppose Mr Oliver put
that idea into your head.

790
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:35,558
No, no. I'm just looking for every
possible motive. That's all.

791
00:52:35,904 --> 00:52:38,052
Mr Harman didn't kill her
if that's what you mean.

792
00:52:38,277 --> 00:52:39,604
What makes you so certain?

793
00:52:39,816 --> 00:52:40,898
Because I know it.

794
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:44,614
I know he couldn't
possibly do such a thing.

795
00:52:45,009 --> 00:52:46,933
If he didn't kill her,
why did he run away?

796
00:52:49,184 --> 00:52:50,641
I can understand that.

797
00:52:50,898 --> 00:52:53,530
He escaped during the war and went
through some pretty bad times.

798
00:52:53,798 --> 00:52:55,879
After that, he spent
months in the hospital.

799
00:52:56,091 --> 00:52:57,399
How do you know all this?

800
00:52:57,871 --> 00:53:00,154
I was a nurse over here.
He was one of my patients.

801
00:53:02,752 --> 00:53:04,706
I don't think he'll ever
completely recover.

802
00:53:04,918 --> 00:53:07,147
He's always been extremely
nervous and if you ..

He cashed this cheque yesterday morning.

Seventy-eight one-pound
notes. The rest in fives.

811
00:53:29,204 --> 00:53:31,158
The fives, yes. But not
the one-pound notes.

me the title quickly.

00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:59,692
But the insurance money?
I thought you had cashed it all.

876
00:56:59,904 --> 00:57:00,614
I did.

877
00:57:01,177 --> 00:57:02,388
Haven't they found it?

878
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,271
No.

879
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:06,903
But I gave it to Ruby.

880
00:57:08,578 --> 00:57:10,470
Do you want to tell me about it?

881
00:57:14,187 --> 00:57:14,870
Well.

882
00:57:16,628 --> 00:57:18,843
It happened the night we
checked the Boston order.

883
00:57:20,045 --> 00:57:21,957
I suddenly found myself kissing her.

884
00:57:22,846 --> 00:57:24,887
I'm not even sure which
one of us started it.

885
00:57:25,099 --> 00:57:28,184
It was over in a second and we went on
with our work like nothing had happened.

886
00:57:29,175 --> 00:57:30,935
I thought she'd forgotten all about it.

887
00:57:31,638 --> 00:57:33,911
The next day she'd changed.
She twisted things.

888
00:57:34,173 --> 00:57:35,158
Demanded money.

889
00:57:35,779 --> 00:57:37,582
I refused of course. So ..

890
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,379
She wrote that letter.
- Try not to think about that now.

891
00:57:42,309 --> 00:57:44,883
How much did you give her?
- All I had. Over 200 pounds.

892
00:57:45,267 --> 00:57:46,420
Why?
- I don't know.

893
00:57:46,632 --> 00:57:48,683
I just lost my head.
I almost forced it on her.

894
00:57:49,016 --> 00:57:51,841
But the money hasn't been found.
They think you've still got it.

895
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:54,963
Then whoever killed
her must have taken it.

896
00:57:55,992 --> 00:57:57,526
This is beginning to make sense.

897
00:57:58,763 --> 00:58:00,555
She was a different person the next day.

898
00:58:00,813 --> 00:58:03,171
Do you suppose somebody
could have put her up to it?

899
00:58:03,383 --> 00:58:05,013
Meaning someone she was with?

900
00:58:05,313 --> 00:58:07,151
That's right. She said she had a date.

901
00:58:07,363 --> 00:58:09,172
Wait a minute.
That was Tuesday, wasn't it?

902
00:58:09,384 --> 00:58:10,057
Yes.

903
00:58:10,495 --> 00:58:12,213
I heard her phoning someone.

904
00:58:12,801 --> 00:58:13,904
A club I think.

905
00:58:14,993 --> 00:58:16,093
Something.

906
00:58:17,652 --> 00:58:19,138
Then she must have come back.

907
00:58:20,438 --> 00:58:22,290
He must have killed her in the basement.

908
00:58:23,328 --> 00:58:24,819
But how did he get in?
- Hold it.

909
00:58:25,031 --> 00:58:26,694
I think I've got something.
- What?

910
00:58:27,735 --> 00:58:30,113
It's the basement.
Something to do with that.

911
00:58:30,325 --> 00:58:31,782
Did you hear anything?

912
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,201
I don't know.

913
00:58:33,795 --> 00:58:36,841
But I saw a light and I went downstairs
to see if she was still there.

914
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:40,063
I think it was something .. I saw.

915
00:58:40,566 --> 00:58:42,522
To do with the books.
- Could I find it?

916
00:58:42,734 --> 00:58:44,962
I don't know because I'm
not sure where it is myself.

917
00:58:45,174 --> 00:58:46,809
But I'm sure it's important because ..

918
00:58:47,021 --> 00:58:49,782
If you went back there do
you think you'd remember?

919
00:58:50,491 --> 00:58:51,294
I might.

920
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,269
Then we must do that.

921
00:58:54,165 --> 00:58:56,765
The trouble is the police are
watching the place the whole time.

922
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,688
If only we could get Clive on our side.

923
00:59:00,811 --> 00:59:03,964
Perhaps he could get them out
of the way for a little while.

924
00:59:04,344 --> 00:59:05,055
John.

925
00:59:05,688 --> 00:59:07,710
You stay here until I call for you.

926
00:59:08,558 --> 00:59:10,560
In the meantime, please trust me.

927
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:12,380
Try not to worry.

928
00:59:13,356 --> 00:59:15,852
Stella, I just don't know what to say.

929
00:59:17,016 --> 00:59:18,388
You are being so wonderful.

930
00:59:19,479 --> 00:59:21,368
But it's more than that.

931
00:59:22,163 --> 00:59:23,606
You've always been like this.

932
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:28,285
I've got so used to it I just don't
know how to say thank you.

933
00:59:30,169 --> 00:59:31,107
You see.

934
00:59:31,975 --> 00:59:33,302
It's alright, John.

935
00:59:34,243 --> 00:59:35,267
I think I know.

936
00:59:37,652 --> 00:59:39,283
I'll be back around seven.

937
00:59:40,218 --> 00:59:41,364
Look after yourself.

938
01:00:01,029 --> 01:00:02,384
Home sweet home.

939
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:09,004
This is the life.

940
01:00:14,482 --> 01:00:16,565
I knew it was a good idea
of yours to come here.

941
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:30,018
Jeff.
- Yeah?

942
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:34,377
Why couldn't I help this time?
You always let me in before.

943
01:00:34,826 --> 01:00:36,173
No. It was a one-man job.

944
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:37,660
I see.

945
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:41,440
Where did the blond bit come in?

946
01:00:42,829 --> 01:00:44,632
Let's forget about her, shall we.

947
01:00:44,989 --> 01:00:46,021
Search me.

948
01:00:49,882 --> 01:00:51,481
Got any cigarettes?
- Only a few.

949
01:00:51,976 --> 01:00:53,562
Not much food either.

950
01:00:53,882 --> 01:00:56,303
I'd better do some shopping
before they close.

951
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:04,555
Here.

952
01:01:05,174 --> 01:01:07,138
Get some cigarettes and
anything else you want.

953
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:08,425
Thanks, darling.

954
01:01:12,025 --> 01:01:13,607
You look tired, my pet.

955
01:01:13,875 --> 01:01:15,897
I could sleep for a couple of days.

956
01:01:17,161 --> 01:01:18,703
Then why not get comfy?

957
01:01:21,934 --> 01:01:24,535
You can't rest like that.
Let's have your coat.

958
01:01:33,762 --> 01:01:34,919
That's perfect.

959
01:01:47,859 --> 01:01:49,164
0-2-0-1-5.

960
01:01:50,371 --> 01:01:51,291
Hello Stella.

961
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:53,516
Clive, I must talk to you.

962
01:01:53,736 --> 01:01:55,122
Can you meet me in a half hour?

963
01:01:55,334 --> 01:01:56,387
Here, you mean?

964
01:01:57,028 --> 01:01:57,819
Where?

965
01:01:58,746 --> 01:02:01,605
No, that's too far. I can't be away
for long. Scotland Yard may need me.

966
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:03,926
What's it all about?

967
01:02:04,594 --> 01:02:06,008
I can't tell you now.

968
01:02:06,329 --> 01:02:08,024
But it has something to do with that.

969
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:09,877
Alright.

970
01:02:10,457 --> 01:02:12,999
I'll meet you in the gardens
off Jermyn Street in about ..

971
01:02:13,674 --> 01:02:16,305
Half an hour. But I shan't
be able to stay long.

972
01:02:24,551 --> 01:02:26,343
I'm sorry I'm late.
- What is all this?

973
01:02:27,274 --> 01:02:29,540
Clive, I need your help. Badly.

974
01:02:29,772 --> 01:02:31,403
Is it you who needs help or Harman?

975
01:02:34,758 --> 01:02:36,129
You've got to help us.

976
01:02:36,646 --> 01:02:39,278
Us? Why should I do anything for him?
Do you know what he's done?

977
01:02:39,603 --> 01:02:41,907
John did not kill Ruby Bruce.
- How do you know that?

978
01:02:42,261 --> 01:02:44,718
Because he gave her some money
last night and it hasn't been found.

979
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:47,885
Now, whoever killed her must have ..
- How do you know? Have you seen him?

980
01:02:50,864 --> 01:02:52,903
You have seen him haven't you.
Where is he?

981
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:57,187
If you know you must tell the police.
Do you realise what can happen to you?

982
01:02:58,258 --> 01:03:01,052
I don't care what happens to me.
- That's just the trouble. You don't.

983
01:03:01,975 --> 01:03:04,145
You know. In some ways
you're such a child, Stella.

984
01:03:04,357 --> 01:03:05,309
Clive, please.

985
01:03:05,632 --> 01:03:07,917
You think you're in love
with him, don't you?

986
01:03:08,168 --> 01:03:10,618
Yes, I am in love with him if
that's what you must know.

987
01:03:10,835 --> 01:03:14,012
I knew alright. I felt you were in love
with him since you came to Pearson's.

988
01:03:14,224 --> 01:03:16,501
Or was it before that?
- I don't care to discuss this.

989
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:18,310
Why not face facts, my dear?

990
01:03:18,522 --> 01:03:21,316
This may be the best thing that could
happen to you. This infatuation.

991
01:03:21,652 --> 01:03:23,863
A nurse in love with her patient.
A married man.

992
01:03:24,075 --> 01:03:26,170
With an invalid wife.
It's all happened before.

993
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:28,494
For heaven's sake.
John's life is in danger.

994
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:31,865
And you're in danger of making a fool of
yourself. To me that's more important.

995
01:03:33,532 --> 01:03:34,979
That surprises you doesn't it.

996
01:03:35,191 --> 01:03:38,457
You had your head in the clouds so long
you never realized how I felt about you.

997
01:03:39,389 --> 01:03:41,505
Would you like me to tell you?
- No, I would not.

998
01:03:41,844 --> 01:03:43,704
I don't want to hear
you're in love with me.

999
01:03:43,916 --> 01:03:46,044
Or I'm really in love with
you and don't know it.

1000
01:03:47,556 --> 01:03:49,962
Clive, will you please let me
tell you why I've come here.

1001
01:03:50,558 --> 01:03:51,843
Alright. Go on.

1002
01:03:53,479 --> 01:03:55,756
John believes someone else
was in the shop last night.

1003
01:03:56,435 --> 01:03:58,622
But he's got to get back
there to prove it.

1004
01:03:58,834 --> 01:03:59,642
He can't.

1005
01:04:00,355 --> 01:04:03,812
Not without the police knowing. They
are watching the place day and night.

1006
01:04:04,024 --> 01:04:06,301
Couldn't you get permission
to work late this evening?

1007
01:04:07,141 --> 01:04:08,281
I think so. Why?

1008
01:04:08,813 --> 01:04:10,670
You know the window
at the back of the shop?

1009
01:04:10,882 --> 01:04:13,548
Yes. Now look, if we're caught ..
- We won't get caught.

1010
01:04:14,645 --> 01:04:16,358
Will you help us or won't you?

1011
01:04:18,468 --> 01:04:19,255
Alright.

1012
01:04:19,744 --> 01:04:21,084
What do you want me to do?

1013
01:04:22,936 --> 01:04:24,821
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1014
01:04:25,547 --> 01:04:27,903
Yes, madam?
- Let me have a hundred Players please.

1015
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:30,256
Sorry. Forty is all I can manage today.

1016
01:04:33,204 --> 01:04:34,758
Couldn't you make an exception?

1017
01:04:34,976 --> 01:04:37,657
I'm afraid not. I've got my other
customers to think about.

1018
01:04:41,532 --> 01:04:42,511
Thank you.

1019
01:04:50,954 --> 01:04:52,964
Excuse me will you. I'm short of change.

1020
01:04:53,217 --> 01:04:54,525
I'll be back in a minute.

1021
01:06:31,388 --> 01:06:33,421
I can't tell you how grateful I am.
- Come on.

1022
01:06:33,633 --> 01:06:36,018
Go back in the office.
There's no point dragging you into this.

1023
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:37,281
That's alright.

1024
01:07:01,567 --> 01:07:02,681
Got the flashlight?

1025
01:07:35,045 --> 01:07:35,868
That's it.

1026
01:07:36,363 --> 01:07:37,102
What?

1027
01:07:37,376 --> 01:07:38,973
Look. Those books.

1028
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:46,441
Somebody must have moved these.

1029
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,523
Look at the ones above.

1030
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:50,816
I wonder if ..

1031
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,308
Lights.

1032
01:07:58,457 --> 01:08:00,346
Now I can understand
why this was so easy.

1033
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:02,990
John Harman, I am a police officer.

1034
01:08:03,209 --> 01:08:05,224
I ask you to come along
with me to the station.

1035
01:08:05,436 --> 01:08:08,694
So a statement may be taken from you
concerning the death of Ruby Bruce.

1036
01:08:10,633 --> 01:08:11,568
Very well.

1037
01:08:12,178 --> 01:08:14,164
At least, may I explain
why I came back here?

1038
01:08:14,503 --> 01:08:15,489
Make it short.

1039
01:08:15,898 --> 01:08:18,175
I was in the shop when Ruby
came back here last night.

1040
01:08:18,751 --> 01:08:21,028
But somebody else was here as well.
- How do you know?

1041
01:08:21,611 --> 01:08:23,140
Those books on the floor.

1042
01:08:25,028 --> 01:08:26,627
Someone put them away upside down.

1043
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:29,641
None of my staff would have done that.

1044
01:08:29,853 --> 01:08:31,936
Whoever did, must have
used this for a spy hole.

1045
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:35,556
Can't you see? These other books
have been disturbed. The blue ones.

1046
01:08:36,308 --> 01:08:37,196
The blue ..?

1047
01:08:37,491 --> 01:08:38,897
What was that?
- Nothing.

1048
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:41,194
Was that all?
- No.

1049
01:08:42,012 --> 01:08:44,181
I gave Miss Bruce a lot of
money when I saw her.

1050
01:08:44,393 --> 01:08:46,614
Whoever killed her must have taken it.
- Why?

1051
01:08:46,826 --> 01:08:48,776
Because there was no money found on her.

1052
01:08:48,988 --> 01:08:50,143
How do you know?

1053
01:08:50,355 --> 01:08:51,287
I told him.

1054
01:08:51,768 --> 01:08:52,817
You did, did you?

1055
01:08:53,744 --> 01:08:56,423
Where did you give her this money?
- In my office. Upstairs.

1056
01:08:56,635 --> 01:08:58,570
Alright. Let's go up there then.

1057
01:09:10,481 --> 01:09:12,338
Alright Mr Oliver.
I don't need you here.

1058
01:09:13,722 --> 01:09:15,288
Tell Miss Tracey to wait until ..

1059
01:09:16,711 --> 01:09:17,914
Where is Miss Tracy?

1060
01:09:27,065 --> 01:09:27,913
Gilbert.

1061
01:09:31,388 --> 01:09:32,016
Sir?

1062
01:09:32,341 --> 01:09:34,981
You saw a lady go out this door?
- That's right. She went on ahead.

1063
01:09:35,193 --> 01:09:37,045
Went on ahead?
What the devil do you mean?

1064
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:39,049
I thought ..
- Never mind. Don't think.

1065
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:40,682
Get after her.
- Yes, sir.

1066
01:09:47,356 --> 01:09:48,862
Good evening.
- Good evening.

1067
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,955
You're not a member are you?
- No.

1068
01:09:52,167 --> 01:09:54,236
You can't come in unless
you're with a member. Sorry.

1069
01:09:54,448 --> 01:09:56,757
But I've got to meet a member here.
He told me to wait.

1070
01:09:57,208 --> 01:09:58,807
That's different. What's his name?

1071
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:01,881
I know this sounds stupid
but I don't remember it.

1072
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:03,887
You see, I just met him once.

1073
01:10:04,398 --> 01:10:06,303
He is really a friend of a girl I know.

1074
01:10:07,234 --> 01:10:09,123
She was here with him
on Tuesday, I think.

1075
01:10:09,478 --> 01:10:11,092
He must have signed her in.

1076
01:10:11,506 --> 01:10:13,267
Tuesday, did you say?
- Yes.

1077
01:10:13,605 --> 01:10:15,125
What was her name?
- Miss Bruce.

1078
01:10:15,337 --> 01:10:17,418
Miss Bruce? I think I remember her.

1079
01:10:18,267 --> 01:10:19,507
Yes. Here we are.

1080
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:21,517
Mr Hart signed her in.

1081
01:10:22,045 --> 01:10:23,627
Yes, of course. Mr Hart.

1082
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,365
I think you'll find him in the bar.
Through there.

1083
01:10:26,577 --> 01:10:27,400
Thank you.

1084
01:10:30,248 --> 01:10:31,093
Thanks.

1085
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,378
If Miss Burley comes in, don't tell
her I've been here. I'll be back later.

1086
01:10:34,590 --> 01:10:36,125
Keep the change.
- Thank you, sir.

1087
01:10:36,337 --> 01:10:37,879
Yes, madam?
- Which is Mr Hart?

1088
01:10:39,285 --> 01:10:40,830
Did you want Mr Hart?
- Yes.

1089
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:43,578
I'm afraid you just missed him.
He was here a few minutes ago.

1090
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:46,690
Could you tell me where he lives?

1091
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:48,765
Yes I could. But why?

1092
01:10:49,299 --> 01:10:51,322
I have a message from him.
It's rather important.

1093
01:10:51,534 --> 01:10:52,818
May I ask who from?

1094
01:10:53,656 --> 01:10:55,432
From a girlfriend of his.
- Oh.

1095
01:10:56,482 --> 01:10:58,985
I'll be seeing him later.
Perhaps I can give him the message?

1096
01:10:59,233 --> 01:11:01,261
Thank you but I have
to deliver it personally.

1097
01:11:01,543 --> 01:11:03,923
I could show you where he lives.
- Don't bother.

1098
01:11:04,637 --> 01:11:06,365
If you could just give me his address.

1099
01:11:06,738 --> 01:11:08,530
That's no trouble. I go that way myself.

1100
01:11:16,515 --> 01:11:17,546
Here we are.

1101
01:11:24,747 --> 01:11:25,570
[ Buzzer ]

1102
01:11:28,758 --> 01:11:29,646
Must be out.

1103
01:11:30,226 --> 01:11:31,583
No point in hanging around.

1104
01:11:31,795 --> 01:11:33,559
Why not give me the message?
I'll tell him.

1105
01:11:33,771 --> 01:11:35,489
I can't do that.
- Why not?

1106
01:11:35,931 --> 01:11:37,696
I promised to tell him myself.

1107
01:11:38,175 --> 01:11:39,878
I'll come back later.
- No you don't.

1108
01:11:44,072 --> 01:11:44,837
Now.

1109
01:11:47,805 --> 01:11:49,269
Vi gave you a message for me.

1110
01:11:49,898 --> 01:11:51,442
Come on, let's have it.

1111
01:11:58,623 --> 01:12:01,229
I was short of money so
I sold a pearl necklace.

1112
01:12:01,576 --> 01:12:02,729
Two hundred pounds?

1113
01:12:03,483 --> 01:12:05,349
Where did you get a pearl necklace from?

1114
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:07,234
From my grandmother.

1115
01:12:08,342 --> 01:12:09,775
She died last Christmas.

1116
01:12:10,755 --> 01:12:12,999
Sorry to hear that.
When did you sell it?

1117
01:12:14,311 --> 01:12:15,589
About two weeks ago.

1118
01:12:16,218 --> 01:12:17,240
That's odd.

1119
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:19,477
These notes only came
from the bank yesterday.

1120
01:12:20,087 --> 01:12:21,175
Are you sure?

1121
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:24,256
There must be some mistake.
- You don't say.

1122
01:12:25,017 --> 01:12:26,175
Who did you sell it to?

1123
01:12:26,387 --> 01:12:28,670
I don't know his name.
I never saw him before.

1124
01:12:32,175 --> 01:12:33,058
Was it him?

1125
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:35,527
No.

1126
01:12:37,095 --> 01:12:38,562
What about the next one?

1127
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:44,611
No.

1128
01:12:45,269 --> 01:12:47,057
That's Jeff Hart, isn't it?
- Yes.

1129
01:12:47,269 --> 01:12:48,625
You know him, don't you.

1130
01:12:48,837 --> 01:12:49,743
I used to.

1131
01:12:50,334 --> 01:12:51,416
Seen him recently?

1132
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:54,466
About three weeks ago.
But not to speak to.

1133
01:12:55,461 --> 01:12:56,640
How is he getting on?

1134
01:12:59,376 --> 01:13:02,107
I'll ask you just once more.
Where is Vi?

1135
01:13:02,663 --> 01:13:05,903
I tell you I don't know her.
- Then why do you want to see me?

1136
01:13:06,761 --> 01:13:08,004
Where do you come from?

1137
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,860
Was it him?
- No.

1138
01:13:17,542 --> 01:13:19,478
Well, why don't you
look at the next one?

1139
01:13:26,851 --> 01:13:28,028
You got it from her.

1140
01:13:29,145 --> 01:13:29,776
No.

1141
01:13:30,084 --> 01:13:32,157
We know it came from her
and she's dead isn't she.

1142
01:13:33,502 --> 01:13:34,133
No.

1143
01:13:34,783 --> 01:13:36,153
Murdered last night.

1144
01:13:42,101 --> 01:13:44,039
Alright. That's all I wanted to know.

1145
01:13:44,251 --> 01:13:45,785
You are in a real mess this time.

1146
01:13:45,997 --> 01:13:47,851
But I didn't have anything
to do with it.

1147
01:13:48,063 --> 01:13:49,036
Take her away.

1148
01:13:49,443 --> 01:13:51,559
Please Mr Dale, you must listen to me.
- Come on.

1149
01:13:52,007 --> 01:13:53,237
I'll tell you everything.

1150
01:13:58,647 --> 01:14:00,800
So, you're from the bookshop, are you?

1151
01:14:01,595 --> 01:14:03,989
A friend of Ruby Bruce, eh?
- You've got to let me go.

1152
01:14:05,523 --> 01:14:06,415
Alright.

1153
01:14:07,226 --> 01:14:08,049
Go ahead.

1154
01:14:13,226 --> 01:14:13,987
Go on.

1155
01:14:28,379 --> 01:14:29,449
No, you don't.

1156
01:14:29,985 --> 01:14:32,035
Do you think I'd let you go
so you can squeal on me?

1157
01:14:32,247 --> 01:14:34,182
You've got to let me out of here.

1158
01:14:39,781 --> 01:14:42,105
She's talked. It's Jeff Hart.
He's at her flat now.

1159
01:14:42,588 --> 01:14:44,547
Where?
46 Denbeigh Street. Top floor.

1160
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:46,840
What about Mr Harman, sir?

1161
01:14:47,489 --> 01:14:49,431
Mr Harman. I'd forgotten about you.
You can go.

1162
01:14:49,643 --> 01:14:51,995
Call tomorrow. I'll know how much
of your money we recovered.

1163
01:14:52,207 --> 01:14:53,961
May I come with you?
- Of course not. Why?

1164
01:14:54,173 --> 01:14:55,675
I want to see you get this man.

1165
01:14:56,351 --> 01:14:57,652
I can understand that.

1166
01:14:58,268 --> 01:15:01,085
Sorry. I can't possibly take
you with me. I'd lose my job.

1167
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:07,693
Come on then.

1168
01:16:08,667 --> 01:16:11,141
That's the window.
The one without the light.

1169
01:16:11,353 --> 01:16:13,892
Where is the front door, sir?
- Round the side. Come on.

1170
01:16:14,104 --> 01:16:16,984
No, Mr Harman. You'd better stay there.
We don't want you mixed up in this.

1171
01:16:49,033 --> 01:16:50,340
Hey Harman. Come back!

1172
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:38,350
Alright. Take him away.

1173
01:17:58,242 --> 01:17:59,294
..s-d..
