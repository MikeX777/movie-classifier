1
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:14,305
FIVE DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON

2
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,740
Let's play a little parlor game,
shall we?

3
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,709
Ah, the rope.
The rope is very important.

4
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,847
We're going to sacrifice
one of the girls of the tribe...

5
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,080
to the great god Kraal.

6
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,817
Our most beautiful virgin,
naturally.

7
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,257
Kraal doesn't give a damn
about these details!

8
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,091
- Come now. Kraal doesn't like to wait.
- Are you going to kill me?

9
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:36,032
- Yes! But only after much torture.
- Are you serious, George?

10
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,626
Kraal and I have never
disappointed a young virgin.

11
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,535
Oh, so that's what Kraal is!

12
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,840
Jacques.

13
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,181
Now serve our guests.

14
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,657
- George, what's that razor for?
- You'll see.

15
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:35,216
George, stop it.
You're hurting me, George!

16
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,297
I haven't even started yet.

17
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,594
And your husband's here.
What are you worried about?

18
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:45,000
You know we all love you.
We chose you out of the whole tribe.

19
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:48,335
But I'm afraid, George, really.
Please, untie me.

20
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,500
Sorry, it's too late.

21
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,477
- Great Kraal, do you want this virgin?
- George, untie me!

22
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,845
Now I deliver this maiden's lifeblood
to your fire!

23
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:03,912
All right, friends,
do with her as you will.

24
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,321
Leniency will not be tolerated!

25
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,596
What's happened?
Jack, where are you?

26
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,896
Silence!

27
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,636
Behold the purifying fame...

28
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,402
which draws nigh, sinner!

29
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,238
Prepare yourself.

30
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,416
Nobody move!

31
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,176
Who did it?

32
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:39,719
Who had that knife?
Doesn't any one remember?

33
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,059
I had it, but someone grabbed it
from me when the lights went out.

34
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:46,063
- And you don't know who it was?
- I know perfectly well.

35
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:47,757
Well, who?

36
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,597
I'm not talking, George.
Let the murderer talk.

37
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,214
- They're going away.
- Who?

38
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,288
Over there. Don't you see?

39
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,322
The sailors and the yacht.

40
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,859
They can go to hell.
I don't care.

41
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:17,156
It's just that I'll be left alone
to take care of everyone.

42
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,163
Including me, darling.

43
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,062
What a bunch of complainers.

44
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,931
For people like them a houseboy
is like a second mother.

45
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,800
Why not leave them then?
We'll hire you, Jacques.

46
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,501
Why the mysterious meeting?

47
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,636
Business matters.

48
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,644
How about being a little more
affectionate, "mommy"?

49
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,911
Come on, hold me.

50
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,426
Does anybody here
understand my husband?

51
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,502
For instance,
why did he send the yacht away?

52
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,230
I'm pretty sure
it wasn't to buy food.

53
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,033
I mean, we are on an island.

54
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,472
That's right. One of us
could get sick or something.

55
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,170
Not much chance of that.
No one gets sick in this house.

56
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,803
George's orders.

57
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,711
George's orders!

58
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,241
Jill, I have a premonition
about this island.

59
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,420
I'm rarely wrong about these things.

60
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,648
Trudy, what are we going to do
about poor little Peggy?

61
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,317
She doesn't like the island.
We'll have to get a different one.

62
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,428
I'm talking about
this mysterious business meeting.

63
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,456
Nice. When are you going
to have a show?

64
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,058
I had one about a month ago.
George set it up for me.

65
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:33,969
- Why did you marry such a beast?
- All men are beasts.

66
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,803
But George turns into a real charmer
when he starts signing checks.

67
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,740
So you married for money.

68
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,404
Nine million dollars. I would have
married my own grandfather for that.

69
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,505
I'm done.
When are they coming down?

70
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,108
Hi, Isabel.

71
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,619
Do you like wildfowers?
There are lots of them around.

72
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,690
Thanks.

73
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:56,420
- Won't you help out in the kitchen?
- Me, in the kitchen? Never!

74
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:59,157
Isabel, aren't you afraid, wandering
all over the island by yourself?

75
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,598
No. Anyway, I think my father
and mother will be back soon.

76
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:06,604
Maybe even tomorrow.
Her operation was a while ago.

77
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,833
Enough of this, Professor.
We want to buy.

78
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,772
You can name your own price.

79
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,867
We'll give you a million dollars down
here and now.

80
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:17,541
Listen, you can have a million down
from each one of us, if you like.

81
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,245
I've told you before:
I don't give a damn about the money.

82
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,679
I came here to rest.

83
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,317
Each one of us has in his pocket
a check for a million dollars.

84
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,157
- Swiss bank, made out to cash.
- A down payment.

85
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,390
And you can cash them
anytime you like.

86
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,296
Three million dollars.

87
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,266
I'm just not interested in money.

88
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,204
Please, listen for once.
We want to buy your formula.

89
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,832
What about all your years of research?
Now you don't want to sell?

90
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:47,344
I'm not sure yet.
I need to give it some more thought.

91
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,175
Please, try to understand.

92
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:55,213
My best friend was killed
because of these experiments.

93
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,221
I know, but that has nothing
to do with your formula.

94
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:02,090
- What about my conscience?
- Your conscience? That's a laugh!

95
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,856
You want your name
in the history books.

96
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,432
It'll be there...
the discovery's yours.

97
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:10,798
Maybe you want me
to throw in my wife too?

98
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,370
That's enough!

99
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,701
I want to get off this island.

100
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,935
Come on, Professor.

101
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,239
Why did you send the yacht away?

102
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:24,648
It looks stormy, and we haven't got
a harbor for that big a boat.

103
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,413
Never mind. Jacques can take me over
tomorrow on the launch.

104
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,852
And my wife said
this was going to be a vacation!

105
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,629
Help me, Trudy.
I'll bet he's never said no to you.

106
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,794
You're wrong. He doesn't change
his mind unless he wants too.

107
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,462
He's one of a kind.

108
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,506
- I married him for it.
- I know.

109
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,301
He's also a great scientist...

110
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,607
but I'm not about
to give anything up.

111
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,945
I want that formula...
at any price.

112
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,644
Can't you accept the fact
that a scientist...

113
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,221
may want to work for humanity
and not for money?

114
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,483
We crass industrialists work
for humanity too.

115
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:07,525
We sell things.
We just don't get sentimental over it.

116
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,184
He doesn't sell, he gives.

117
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,195
There's an important convention
in Geneva next Monday.

118
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,128
He's going to announce it there.

119
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,564
Look, you'd better not do
anything rash...

120
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:19,798
because the three of us don't want
to give up anything, like I said.

121
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,667
Is that a threat?

122
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,437
- What is it?
- I came to get Trudy.

123
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:32,176
- We're supposed to go for a walk.
- You don't need me, do you, darling?

124
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,952
No, go ahead.

125
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:37,716
All right.
I won't be gone long.

126
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,986
I just wanted to warn you.

127
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,709
I had no idea it bothered you
so much, Trudy.

128
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:13,512
I never would have married
if I'd known.

129
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,152
I'm sorry, but I don't believe you.

130
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,781
And anyway, you could always
divorce him.

131
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:23,225
What for?
What do you care about him?

132
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,854
I can't believe
you married someone...

133
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,933
who could take you
away from me...

134
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,799
No, Trudy, he'll never take me
away from you, I swear.

135
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,866
Well, I see Marie is paying
the houseboy another visit.

136
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:40,776
- Where? I can't see her.
- There, on the launch.

137
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,581
Jacques, can you hear me?

138
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,691
Darling.

139
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,817
Don't you feel well?

140
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,037
- So what was I telling you?
- That I'm a dirty whore.

141
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,605
That's why I'm taking a shower.
At least now I'll be a clean whore.

142
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,083
Then you asked how I could sleep
with the houseboy.

143
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,747
After all, one does have to do
something for the working classes, no?

144
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:43,191
Anyway, you were saying
that your wife is very bad.

145
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,459
I'm listening,
if you want to go on.

146
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:54,331
You see,
I don't care that he's a houseboy.

147
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,874
It all boils down
to a matter of good taste.

148
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,911
WhyJacques, when there are
a lot of better choices around?

149
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:06,440
- I'm not the jealous type.
- I don't know what the hell you mean!

150
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,510
You threw yourself away
on a houseboy.

151
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:13,148
Don't be ridiculous.
It was just a pastime.

152
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:17,456
- If you want to know what I think...
- Dear wife, I don't ask you to think...

153
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,396
only to do something.

154
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:23,332
Just what the hell
do you want me to do?

155
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,962
A wife should help her husband.

156
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,768
In this case, how?

157
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,272
What you did with the houseboy...

158
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:36,370
could be of help
in convincing the professor.

159
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:41,250
And now tell me
who's the dirty whore, you bastard!

160
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:44,948
If that's your idea
of what I should do to help you...

161
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:47,988
you can count on it.

162
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,561
I'll be glad to help you out
with all my pals, okay?

163
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,892
That's fine, darling.
Start with George.

164
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:47,210
Come up to the house.
It's no use staying here.

165
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,762
Who could have done it?

166
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,428
No, we mustn't touch him
until the police get here.

167
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,473
Yes, I know.

168
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:15,673
If we don't do something about him,
the crabs will take care of it for us.

169
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,375
The police will have
a nice white skeleton to look at.

170
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,814
PoorJacques!

171
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,852
You killed him, didn't you?

172
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:30,224
I can't figure out whether
you're dangerous or just stupid.

173
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,355
You forget, my dear husband:
I like my men alive!

174
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,993
Hello! Hello!

175
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,569
Save your breath,
Professor Farrell.

176
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,638
Looks like it's out of order.

177
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,764
What's all the yelling about?

178
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:47,277
George, did you throw
this damn thing out of whack?

179
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,046
It was working before.

180
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,216
Hello. Hello!

181
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:02,054
Didn't you want anybody
to call the police?

182
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,924
They don't worry me at all.

183
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:09,195
That's right. You're the big fish
that nobody can touch.

184
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,966
I'm getting out of here.
I'm taking the motorboat.

185
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,902
Come back here!

186
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,635
Professor, where do you think
you're going?

187
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:19,210
You can't go!

188
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,308
- It's not there.
- What?

189
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,440
You sent it away,
like you did with the yacht.

190
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,451
No, I didn't.
Help me look for it.

191
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,350
Where could it be?

192
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,204
We're the first ones
to put a houseboy in deep freeze.

193
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,576
Jill, darling, stop it, please!

194
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:03,205
You've got to forget it.
It's all over.

195
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,275
Stop it!

196
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,251
You stop it! Go away!
Just leave me alone.

197
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:12,983
Jill, you can't go on like this.
Come on, darling, try to stop.

198
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,250
- You want a drink?
- No, thanks.

199
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:22,123
Houseboys come and go,
but there's always a bottle.

200
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,994
Let me have that.
Death makes me thirsty.

201
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,740
Jill, honey, stop it!

202
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,074
Death makes you feel dirty.

203
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:40,309
Come on, darling.

204
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,580
You can't go on like this.

205
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,746
I'm going out
for a breath of air.

206
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,653
- Not a bad idea.
- A shower for me.

207
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,520
Come on, that's enough now, please.

208
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,327
You know, you're crying
just like a bad-tempered child.

209
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,961
- Come on, honey.
- That's enough. Stop it!

210
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,771
I don't know
what you're up to, George.

211
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,967
I just know
you wouldn't stop at anything!

212
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,909
You fool! Shut up!

213
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:13,875
See what you can do with her, Trudy.
You've got a way with women.

214
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,788
I swear, Trudy,
he'll pay for this!

215
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:23,421
Jill, darling, listen to me.

216
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,562
Don't you know a woman
keeps quiet about these things?

217
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:33,764
She may even kill a man,
but she keeps quiet about it.

218
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,879
Of course, darling,
that's what we'll do.

219
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,284
We'll leave this place,
whenever you want.

220
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:57,088
Just a minute.

221
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,464
Come in.

222
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,000
I was thinking.

223
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:16,471
So far we've done nothing but talk.
Here is one million dollars.

224
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:22,250
If you decide to deal just with me,
you'll get five more...

225
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,918
and no one will know about it.

226
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,221
You're wasting your time.

227
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:35,064
I'm not selling my formula.

228
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,265
No need to decide now.
Think about it.

229
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:48,440
If you want to cash it,
just remember 2-2-3-3-3.

230
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,879
The bank account number.

231
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:04,086
- Who gave you this?
- Nick.

232
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:08,327
- Does that mean you're selling?
- No. I'll give it back to him.

233
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,602
Nick, take this back.
I don't want it.

234
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,904
- Give it some thought.
- I'd rather not.

235
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:22,138
You never know
what might happen.

236
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,916
I'm leaving it on the bed.

237
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,821
Isabel!
What's this about?

238
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,220
Give me that shawl. It's mine.

239
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:50,453
Sure I'll give it to you.

240
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:52,926
Wait! Where are you going?
Come here.

241
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:56,990
- No, please go. Leave me alone.
- Didn't you say it was yours?

242
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:58,729
Yes.

243
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,567
Take it. Don't be afraid.

244
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,166
All right, now, I want to know
what this is all about!

245
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,737
Professor, what are you doing here?

246
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:12,749
I came to tell you
I left the check in your room.

247
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,950
Here.

248
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:20,782
You scientists are all alike.

249
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:24,293
You refuse to sell a formula
that would make you a fortune...

250
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:28,593
and you leave a million dollars
lying around as if it were nothing.

251
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,163
Well, it's time to wake up.

252
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,072
A million dollars? Wow!

253
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,432
What's your formula?
An atomic bomb?

254
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:41,569
No, just a new type
of industrial resin.

255
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,840
You're so different from the others.

256
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,779
- What others?
- Everybody.

257
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:53,020
Have you thought about how many things
you could buy with a million dollars?

258
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,251
A lot of things.

259
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,328
- What's your name?
- Isabel.

260
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:00,556
But a million dollars is not
all that much, really.

261
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:02,530
For instance, Professor...

262
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:06,900
once you've bought a yacht, a couple
of Rolls-Royces and a nice villa...

263
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,836
your million is gone.

264
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,704
What happens after that,
Professor?

265
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,910
Another formula.

266
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:19,265
If it isn't Trudy,
the beautiful icicle.

267
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,605
- Want some?
- No.

268
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:27,269
Well, I do.
I want all of it, every drop.

269
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:33,911
That's better.
Now let's try something else.

270
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,719
Know something, Trudy?

271
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:43,522
This is the best formula
your husband has come up with yet.

272
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:50,133
You are a beautiful woman,
full of passion.

273
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:59,839
Trudy, a man like me...

274
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:02,708
and a woman like you.

275
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:09,547
My hand on your skin.
Do you feel it, Trudy?

276
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:13,980
I feel I've been looking for you
forever, as though we were...

277
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,396
You don't understand.

278
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:43,751
You're crazy.

279
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,916
There's been a murder here,
and you expect me to stay calm.

280
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,054
We can't just sit around
and make small talk.

281
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,732
Listen, I don't care
about the six million dollars...

282
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,994
Nick promised to give me today.

283
00:33:58,102 --> 00:34:00,400
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

284
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,741
The good professor accepted
a check from me...

285
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:06,833
for one million dollars,
as it happens.

286
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,912
That wasn't what we agreed.

287
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:13,211
I know, but we didn't expect
to play fair, now, did we?

288
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,046
You know damn well.
I left that check in your room, Nick.

289
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,588
Funny, I didn't find it there.

290
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,796
The last thing I expected...
a visit from you.

291
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,431
- Where's the check?
- The check?

292
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:41,638
I left it here.
On top of your brassiere.

293
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,739
A check in my brassiere... how sweet.
I hope you find it.

294
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:02,031
Take a look. You're sure to lay
your hands on something nice.

295
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:21,811
Jack, I'm afraid.

296
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:24,410
I'm sorry,
but I just can't help it.

297
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:27,082
You're sure there's no way
to call the police?

298
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:31,486
That's what they all say.
We have nothing to hide from anyone.

299
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:34,861
But I keep seeing Jacques dead.

300
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,298
I just know
something's going to happen.

301
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:40,029
Try to guess what it is.

302
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,470
Only if you're willing, of course.

303
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:20,737
It's going to revolutionize
the world market!

304
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,746
I swear, if I can't get my hands
on that formula legally...

305
00:36:43,234 --> 00:36:45,031
The ring!

306
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,028
Too bad, Nick.

307
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:22,401
You want to play dirty,
don't you?

308
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:27,335
Now, if you were
to go along with me...

309
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,345
and there's still time...

310
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,540
it would be better.

311
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,776
For you, of course.

312
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,011
Who are you trying to frighten?

313
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,987
We're exactly alike,
the two of us.

314
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:43,757
We're two rotten bastards
cast from the same mold, George.

315
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:46,421
Never forget it, all right?

316
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:13,346
- Trudy, I didn't see you and...
- And?

317
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,152
And I got a bit frightened.

318
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,955
You know I'm good
about keeping appointments.

319
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,360
You're so silly.
Everything seems to frighten you.

320
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:25,401
I just can't stop thinking
there's a murderer among us.

321
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:35,702
Everyone seems to be waiting
for something that's not happening.

322
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:40,307
But whoever killed Jacques
might kill someone else.

323
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:43,083
Trudy, who could it have been?

324
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,225
Don't think about it anymore, Jill.

325
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,318
Let's try to forget the whole thing,
at least for a while, all right?

326
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:54,023
All right. Forgive me.

327
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,584
I want to show you a beautiful spot.
You'll see.

328
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:47,041
A gunshot!
The other side of that rock!

329
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,846
Hurry!

330
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:56,292
Fritz!

331
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,332
- He's dead, Jill.
- Did you hear that? Up there!

332
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,329
Come on.
We've got to warn the others!

333
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:45,370
Nick! George!
Come here!

334
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:48,038
Someone's killed the professor!

335
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:51,239
- They shot him!
- Hurry!

336
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:57,212
Someone dragged him
into the water. Why?

337
00:40:57,488 --> 00:41:00,082
So that his body
wouldn't be found.

338
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,716
By the way, there's no chance
you made a mistake, is there?

339
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,954
Of course not!
I saw him. He was dead.

340
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:08,828
And so did Jill. I believe you.
But it's strange.

341
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,800
Whoever pulled him out there
didn't cover the tracks.

342
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:13,699
So? What does that mean?

343
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:17,240
It means that whoever did it
was in one hell of a hurry.

344
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,039
Please, let's get back to the house.
I'm afraid out here.

345
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,339
He was in a hurry.
What for?

346
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:25,574
To get back to the house in time
to be called out to look at the corpse.

347
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,548
You mean one of us?

348
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,619
There's not the slightest doubt.

349
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:39,586
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

350
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,562
- Just for you to confess.
- What?

351
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,099
We think you know
where the formula's hidden.

352
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,169
But I don't.
He never told me anything.

353
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:49,535
Not even where he hid my check?
It was for a million dollars!

354
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,165
When I went out,
my husband was sleeping...

355
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,938
but one of you woke him up
and made him go out.

356
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,343
That's the person
we should be looking for.

357
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:59,780
Why did you go out
in the first place?

358
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,978
- Why did you meetJill?
- That is none of your business!

359
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:06,579
On, no? I left a million dollars
here on this table...

360
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,718
and I want it back!

361
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,097
Anyone else want to try?
I'm ready.

362
00:45:00,264 --> 00:45:02,095
Have you had breakfast yet?

363
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:08,896
What's the water like?
Any breakers?

364
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:22,146
I should take you out and drown you.
That would teach you to answer me.

365
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,746
Right, Peg?

366
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:54,576
Looks like we're all going
to wind up subzero.

367
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,414
- Am I right?
- You asking me?

368
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,420
Why did it have to be her?

369
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:01,355
Why did you want me to bring her?
What harm did she ever do to you?

370
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,392
Start talking or I'll kill you!

371
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:06,019
Only murderers kill.

372
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:41,521
Jack, where are you?

373
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:48,835
Answer!

374
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,508
Where are you?

375
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:15,095
Where the hell are you hiding?

376
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:37,945
Jack, answer!

377
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,525
Where are you?

378
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:24,228
Isabel, have you seen
Jack anywhere?

379
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:39,339
- Would you like something to drink?
- Maybe later.

380
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,450
Look!

381
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:47,713
Oh, God! Not him too!

382
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:52,252
Where were you?

383
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,597
- Here he is, George.
- We looked for you everywhere.

384
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,395
Where's Marie?

385
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:45,204
This time, seltzer water
won't turn the trick.

386
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:19,981
What's the matter with you,
if I may ask?

387
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:23,775
I can't stay here any longer.
You must let me leave.

388
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:26,617
- I'm afraid of all of you.
- Even me?

389
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:30,789
I don't feel
I ever knew you, George.

390
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:34,894
I know there's a way of getting
off this island, isn't there, George?

391
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:37,262
But you didn't want anybody to go.
You kept us all here.

392
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:40,029
Why, George? Do you realize
the professor would still be alive?

393
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:42,697
And Peggy and Jacques.

394
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:44,603
And poor little Marie.

395
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:47,302
Well, I didn't kill them, you know!

396
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:49,606
Maybe it was you after all!

397
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:53,240
What? Stop it.
You can think what you like.

398
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,650
I can't go on!

399
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,480
Nick, may I ask
what you're doing?

400
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,679
Nothing.
Just looking for that check.

401
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:35,155
And you expect to find it
in my desk?

402
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:42,517
What are you doing?

403
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:44,917
Why did you turn off the record player?

404
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,789
What the hell are you up to?

405
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:54,057
I'd like at least my voice
to stay around.

406
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,598
My name's Trudy Farrell.

407
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:06,635
One of these three men
murdered my husband.

408
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:12,580
The first one is George Stark,
the man who invited us all here.

409
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,583
Number two is Jack Davidson...

410
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:21,487
a business associate
of the aforementioned George Stark.

411
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:26,090
The third man's name is
Nick Chaney.

412
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:30,360
I suppose he, too,
does business with George.

413
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:32,935
One of these three men...

414
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,141
We're all a little upset.

415
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:43,940
- Why don't we try to get some sleep?
- No.

416
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:47,812
Why not, George?

417
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:51,944
You got another one of
your clever ideas? What is it?

418
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:54,683
We sleep here, all four of us.

419
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:58,056
- You think so, do you?
- Sounds risky to me, George.

420
00:54:58,161 --> 00:54:59,753
Knight...

421
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,993
bishop...

422
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,066
queen.

423
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:05,998
Checkmate.

424
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:09,196
- But not a bad plan.
- Very clever.

425
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,069
Don't you agree?

426
00:55:11,174 --> 00:55:13,938
The murderer will kill us all at once!

427
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,143
Well, I'm not playing.
He won't find me.

428
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:25,548
Let him go, George.
Let him risk his life if he wants to.

429
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:59,685
- Nick's gone out.
- Trudy, are you starting that again?

430
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:02,553
The other two
are still here with me.

431
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:04,650
It's an obsession.

432
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:08,897
Each person can watch
over the others.

433
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:14,533
If the murderer is among us
and makes a wrong move...

434
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:16,264
He hasn't so far!

435
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:20,503
we'll find out just who he is.

436
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,840
Will you please stop it!
It's getting on my nerves.

437
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:24,573
Never mind all that!

438
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:26,649
I got something in this shaker
you won't believe!

439
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,411
I'm losing my mind!

440
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:30,543
Trudy, you come over here too.

441
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:33,520
We can at least
keep each other company.

442
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:59,603
Strange, there's no one here.
You two take a look upstairs.

443
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:05,779
If there isn't anyone here,
how did they get off the island?

444
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:19,961
Unless some friends happened
to pass by and picked them up.

445
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:21,496
Could be, sir.

446
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:27,232
There's no one here.

447
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,141
There doesn't seem to be
anyone upstairs, sir.

448
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:41,277
I'll be damned.
Well, that's all we can do.

449
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,637
My head is killing me!

450
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,536
Do you two feel all right?
George!

451
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,701
We've been drugged.

452
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:20,339
Somebody put something
in that drink.

453
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,544
It can't be.
I made it myself.

454
01:00:24,253 --> 01:00:27,620
If it wasn't you,
who could it have been?

455
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:29,589
Who could have put a drug
in our glasses?

456
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:32,354
Any one of us.

457
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:35,055
What for?

458
01:00:35,164 --> 01:00:38,895
It was probably meant to kill us,
but it wasn't strong enough.

459
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:42,233
- Who could it be?
- It had to be one of us.

460
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:46,570
We all fell asleep except Nick.

461
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:18,671
- Strange... we're all still alive.
- At least for now.

462
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:21,903
Shall we bet who dies first?
The dead one wins.

463
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:25,447
The yacht should be here already.
It won't be much longer anyway.

464
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:23,568
- What happened?
- It's very simple.

465
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:25,766
The machine kept on recording
while we were asleep.

466
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:29,572
- And they didn't see us.
- That's right. It's absurd!

467
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:33,411
Not only absurd... impossible!
We were here.

468
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:35,450
Evidently we weren't.

469
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:37,542
What did you say?

470
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:39,518
You want us all to go crazy?

471
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:41,783
So that's your game, eh?

472
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,882
Why don't you kill us
like you did the others?

473
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:46,757
You're the one who's crazy,
and I was blind not to see it before!

474
01:02:46,863 --> 01:02:49,491
But you're through now.
I'll get you first!

475
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:56,363
Well! A very interesting
point of view.

476
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:01,535
I must confess
I had underestimated you, Trudy.

477
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:03,509
Oh, really? Why?

478
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,639
Do you think thatJack is right?
That I'm the killer?

479
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:11,308
Sit down, Trudy.
It doesn't matter what I think.

480
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:15,057
I'm not a man of thought.
I'm a man of action.

481
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:17,718
Take this, my dear.
It's my million dollars.

482
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:22,958
I don't think you're crazy,
and money's important, isn't it?

483
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:27,795
Very important.
I see you're quite clever, George.

484
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:31,471
You want me to help you?
Just wait here.

485
01:03:31,574 --> 01:03:34,202
All right. I trust you.

486
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:32,466
Damn it!
It won't start.

487
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,849
- Trudy, Jack, where are you?
- Right here.

488
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:23,884
I saw what you found,
and you'll be sorry you did.

489
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:26,011
You know, if you hadn't,
I would have let you live.

490
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:27,783
Stay where you are.

491
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:29,619
I'm the one that got rid
of the launch.

492
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:33,923
And the telephone.
And you killed Nick. But when?

493
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:37,329
While you and Trudy were asleep.

494
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:39,901
But we were all drugged!

495
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:42,596
The sleeping pills
were only in your two glasses.

496
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:44,229
Why?

497
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:47,468
So that when the sailors came,
they wouldn't find you...

498
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:49,840
so they would think
you had gone.

499
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:53,109
You won't get away with it!
Where will you put the bodies?

500
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:56,582
I'll hide them in the launch,
and then I'll sink it.

501
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:58,313
They'll find it!

502
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:00,582
The water's very deep,
and I have no other choice.

503
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:04,320
Look, Jack, you said
you didn't want to kill me.

504
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:06,258
That was my original plan.

505
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:08,887
I wanted you alive,
to take the blame for everything.

506
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:13,162
- After all, you killed the professor.
- I did? How do you figure that?

507
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:14,964
- I killed the others, but not him.
- I didn't either!

508
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:17,335
- I don't believe you!
- And Peggy?

509
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,170
She had to die too.
She knew too much.

510
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:23,734
And leaving witnesses behind
would be bad for my health.

511
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:03,477
Trudy, is that you?

512
01:08:57,533 --> 01:09:01,162
Come in, Jack.
Don't be afraid.

513
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:03,795
I'm unarmed, as you see.

514
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:07,974
I heard that you don't like
people around who know too much...

515
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:12,480
and that you killed the professor,
which was not part of our plans.

516
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:14,515
I didn't kill your husband.

517
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:17,017
So if it wasn't George,
it must have been you.

518
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:20,611
- Now why would I do that?
- I don't know.

519
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:23,453
There are lots of things
you don't know...

520
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:25,925
while I know that
you can't shoot me.

521
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:28,019
I'm the only who knows
where the formula is hidden...

522
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,223
and you find that
very interesting, don't you?

523
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:33,529
So there's not much you can do
but stick to the bargain.

524
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:35,365
Just like you, right?

525
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:37,098
You've already pocketed
two checks...

526
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:39,140
and if I want the formula
I'll have to give you mine too.

527
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:40,868
- That's right, Jack.
- Okay.

528
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:42,273
Come with me.

529
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,382
For all these reasons...

530
01:13:10,052 --> 01:13:13,818
this court finds you responsible...

531
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:18,859
for the death of your friend
and colleague, Dr. Kruger...

532
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:22,522
whom you murdered
with the express intent and purpose...

533
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:25,361
of stealing the formula
of an important discovery of his...

534
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:27,901
for your own unlawful gain.

535
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:33,498
You are condemned to be hanged
by the neck until dead.

536
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:44,213
You're probably a little surprised
that I've come.

537
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:47,550
Do you understand
how much I love you?

538
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:52,684
I worshiped you from the moment I first
looked into your sweet, gentle eyes.

539
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:58,233
I even loved you after I found out
you'd killed that man for his formula.

540
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:00,528
You believe me, don't you?

541
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:07,406
I'm not judging you.
You're the only man I'll ever love.

542
01:14:09,912 --> 01:14:14,246
I don't mean to scold you,
but why the pentothal bullets?

543
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,641
And then why did you keep on
with the pentothal?

544
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:18,583
That's what really did it.

545
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:21,520
That's what my father does
with animals, to save them.

546
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:23,887
I didn't know it would have the effect
of making you talk...

547
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:27,189
and that you would tell that officer
everything you had done.

548
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,560
It was a real piece of bad luck.

549
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:31,724
How could I have known
about that?

550
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:34,462
When my father shoots animals
with sodium pentothal...

551
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,629
they just lie there.
They don't talk.

552
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:41,175
I thought I could save you.
They were going to kill you, you know.

553
01:14:43,445 --> 01:14:45,845
- Thanks.
- That's all right.

554
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:50,247
You know, maybe you...

555
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:52,252
Maybe I what?

556
01:14:52,354 --> 01:14:55,585
You could help me.
I'm fat broke.

557
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:59,618
You spent three million dollars?

558
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:02,026
No, just two.

559
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:09,094
Darling, come closer.

560
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:13,163
I cashed Jack's check
and George's check, but not Nick's.

561
01:15:13,275 --> 01:15:16,802
I would do it but I need
the account number.

562
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:19,676
They ask you for it.

563
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,544
It's a very simple number.

564
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:25,620
2-2-3-3-3.

565
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:31,818
I love you, Fritz!
I'll pray for you, my love!

566
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:34,255
- Drive to Lausanne.
- Yes, miss. Where is that?

567
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:35,414
Switzerland.
