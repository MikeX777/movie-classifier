Don't peep!

177
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,938
- I've almost got it.
- Sure.

178
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,145
Why should I listen to her?

179
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,297
Hey, you haven't paid.

180
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,464
Wait up!

181
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,863
Don't try to get away!

182
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,307
Don't try to get away!

183
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,700
A ticket? I'm leaving right away.

184
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,740
Then, I'll give it to you right away.

185
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,345
Over here, sir, we're very clean.

186
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,385
Drop the price a little.

187
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,377
Go see your mother!
maybe she'll do it free to you.

188
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,022
I've made a fortune!

189
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,424
Forget it... I'm too tired to go on.
I quit!

190
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,222
How much do I owe you?

191
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,103
$467.60
I've never made such easy money.

192
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,187
Oh no,
the pickpocket must've taken my wallet.

193
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,743
What?
Your not going to pay?

194
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,746
Poice, he's not payihg his fare.

195
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,702
You want all the prostitutes
in the street.

196
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,027
Listen girls.
This big man is paying for all of you! Hurry!

197
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,061
No!
But I don't...

198
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,985
Can you tell me if you've seen...

199
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,702
It's a tuba!

200
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,983
Chief, this guy has a tuba.

201
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,466
A Chinese tuba and violin,
don't go together.

202
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,784
We're not playing western music,
tell him to leave!

203
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,026
Comrad es, I vwas also a soldier too.

204
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,826
Really? which unit?

205
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,662
5th army of Sanghu.

206
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,019
- IMe tee!
- We're from the same uhit.

207
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,697
Come. Salute!

208
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,300
Have you seen
a girl with short hair around here?

209
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,545
a girl?
With short hair?

210
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,863
Will long hair do?

211
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,378
What, Where?
What did he say?

212
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,098
Your deaf!
Don't push on my head.

213
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,459
You mean the girl with short hair?

214
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,580
Yes. You've seen her?

215
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,787
I don't know I'm blind!
Ask them.

216
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,459
Have you seen her? Have you?

217
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,908
Nevermind.

218
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,224
It seems that they haven't.

219
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,704
He left.
Why didn't you say so?

220
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,820
Don't fall into the river!

221
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,659
My friend, We're not hiring musicians.
Go away.

222
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,541
<i>Shu Pei lin</i>

223
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,623
Shu Pei lin, you're on next!

224
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,946
Don't rush me or I'll take the toilet
with me.

225
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,657
Boss.

226
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,787
A drink, Boss?
A Merry Widow!

227
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,867
Isn't any girl interested in your ring?

228
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,628
Don't worry,
I'll find the right person for it.

229
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,740
Who'd be so unlucky?

230
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,820
Why didn't you tell me someone
wanted time with me?

231
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,780
Don't you know I need the money?

232
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,423
I... I forgot.

233
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,268
Whatever, Big boobs.

234
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,105
What'd you call me?

235
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,375
Oh no!

236
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,588
Shu Pei lin, you're on next!

237
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,224
Don't rush me or I'll go up there naked.

238
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,864
Don't do that, or we'll all lose our jobs.

239
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,145
- Is that so?
- Look at her!

240
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,124
<i>Those dreamy dreamy eyes</i>

241
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,623
<i>Those dreamy dreamy stars</i>

242
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,624
<i>Let that good fine wine,</i>

243
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,604
<i>Fill up that empty empty heart</i>

244
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,622
Oh no... . the dress!

245
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,944
She went on stage with it.

246
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,343
This is bad!

247
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,948
Your dress...

248
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,227
It has a big hole in it!

249
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:12,222
<i>Those piles of money,</i>
<i>Will find you love</i>

250
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,229
<i>A dream that's made of riches</i>

253
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,659
It's Big Boobs fault, she dragged me
away from ironing.

254
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,820
What a great performance.

255
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,145
What an applause!

256
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,498
You know your better than me.

257
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,578

00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,744
I'll kill you!

259
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,139

00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,106
You finished?
Yes.

264
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,020
Excuse me.

265
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,018
I'm in a hurry
I didn't mean itt.

266
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,107
You dare ruin my girl's dress,
You want trouble?

267
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,820
You better pay protection money.

268
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,383
If you want to work!
Otherwise, don't mess around!

269
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,942

Don't kill yourself!

271
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,099
Who wants to kill themsef?

272
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,866
You!

273
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,747
Don't let go!
Let go?

274
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,904
I can't believe you want this!

275
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,305
I can't swim, help!

276
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,024
Now, do you understand
how precious life is?

277
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,259
Stop lecturing me and come save me!

278
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,744
Only idiots commit suicide.

279
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,383
I'll let you marinate a little.

280
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,739
When you say your sorry,
I'll come save you.

281
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,177
Feel sorry yet?

282
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,506
I'm really really sorry.

283
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,625
Poor girl!

284
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,539
Don't be so stupid from now on.

285
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,860
In life, you have to be brave.

286
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,779
Look at me,
I'm all alone, no money, no friends.

287
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,820
I must wander in the streets,
without nowhere to go.

288
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,065
However, I don't want to commit suicide.

289
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,066
It should be me trying to kill myself.

290
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,666
Your right, you should die, not me.
Go ahead then!

291
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,904
Pedicab!
Coming.

292
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,825
Take a seat.

293
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,105
You realY don't have anywhere to sleep?

294
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,382
I cant believe it!
Your letting me stay with you!

295
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,739
There is no need to repay me.

296
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,225
People should help one another.
But, promise me, you won t kill yourself again.

297
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,420
What will happen if you do,
and I'm not there?

298
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,586
Shut up! or I'm changing my mind.

299
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,019
Here we are!

300
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,787
Time's up
Still eating?

301
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,227
Here's your money.
Thank you.

302
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,220
This big trunk is blocking the stairs.

303
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,419
Who moves at this hour?

304
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,466
Wateh it

305
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,104
Does this coolie live up here?

306
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,663
Nobody lives upstairs,
He's probably just moving in.

307
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,382
Come in.

308
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,466
My house is falling apart.

309
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,668
You, up there!

310
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,347
Put your coffin dowh more gently!

311
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,943
What a bitch.

312
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,817
Here's your diner, fishy.

313
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,342
If this light flickers one more time!
I'll break it!

314
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,301
Hurry!

315
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,825
Just in time.

316
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,139
Much better.

317
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,982
A few more drops, please.

318
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,740
This is beautiful!

319
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,147
In Shahghai you have to rely on Yourself.
Don't be meoeh.

320
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,702
Out!

321
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,586
It really is beautiful.

322
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,907
Great! It's working!

323
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,462
Each drop is invaluable
like the dew. it must not be wasted.

324
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,424
A Rat!

325
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,227
Take that!
It's either me or you.

326
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,585
Time to go!

327
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,182
Who did that?

328
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,977
I'll let you go free!
Go on!

329
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,708
A Rat!

330
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,387
What is it?
A Rat!

331
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,904
It's right behind you!

332
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,902
Where is it!?

333
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,303
Where it is?

334
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,385
In your night gown.

335
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,817
Help me!

336
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,747
I'm scared of rats too,
Someone help!

337
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,778
It s still on your back.

338
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,944
Help me catch it!

339
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,225
Come out, it's gone.

340
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,149
Really? Damn you coffin-man!
Scared the hell outta me!

341
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,462
Where is he?

342
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,585
Taking a shower.

343
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,817
Get down.

344
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,510
What the...!

345
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,420
Over here.

346
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,982
What was that?!

347
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,427
I've never seen a man ashaminig himself before.

348
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,263
Tell me what'd you see?!

349
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,746
Lot's of soap suds!

350
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,897
I always sleep alone.

351
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,578
You take the sofa, I take the bed.
Good night.

352
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,860
But, the bed is more comfortable.

353
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,822
The rat!

354
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,586
How did you get here?
Get back on the sofa!

355
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,303
What are you doing?

356
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,382
Do re mi!

357
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,500
Get up!
They raised the price of rice to $70.

358
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,780
Trading is restricted, They're all buying
up penicillin.

359
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,548
Banks are closing down!
How can you sleep?!

360
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,103
Open the windows,

361
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,459
let the sun in,
breathe the fresh air.

362
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,624
Have some nutritious Dried milk
free from the church.

363
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,263
Dried milk?

364
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,347
Everytime you bring something,
you want something.

365
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,148
Can you lend me $ 2 million?
I need it to pay the rent.

366
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,657
Bad timing.

367
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,299
My wallet was stolen.

368
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,819
Ask the pickpocket, maybe he can
lend you some money.

369
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,947
So, this money isn't yours?

370
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,982
Right, it's not mine.
Perfect

371
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,665
I have to return that.

372
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,828
I need it to save me now.
I thought we were friends?

373
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,940
Enough of this bul-shit. Bye.

374
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,144
Asshole!

375
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,106
I've never seen anything so beautiful.

376
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,778
Those Hairy legs again!

377
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,225
I'm sure I heard a noise, A ghost!?

378
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,622
Get down from there.
It's dangerous. Careful

379
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,227
I hurt myself.

380
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,402
So it's you?

381
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,739
I wasn t peeping.
I was only the stool.

382
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,417
What do you mean?
the stepping stool.

383
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,983
I don't understand.
It s nothing. Goodbye.

384
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,288
Waitt a minute.

385
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,860
Is it that high?
I almost fell all the way down there.

386
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,781
Wake up.

387
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,988
Where am I?

388
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,827
I carried you inside.

389
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,262
What else did you do?

390
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,539
Nothing. I didn't do anything.

391
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,786
Lucky I woke up so fast.

392
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,867
Wait! I want to ask you. Have you ever
been to Suzhou bridge?

393
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,388
- Yes.
- What for?

394
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,067
I jumped.
You jumped?

395
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,783
Yes. To save somebody.
Really?

396
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,137
It was yesterday evening.

397
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,783
What about ten years ago?

398
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,177
It really is you!?
I found you finally!

399
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,948
What are you doing?
I don't know what your talking about.

400
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,303
When you said "ha"!
I thought you were her.

401
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,388
If you embrace me when I say "ha"
You'd probably rape me if I said "oach"

402
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,501
I did not go there ten years ago,
it was yesterday.

403
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,307
I've got the wrong person.

404
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,182
Is this your wife?

405
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,584
Yes...no! She's a friend.

406
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,778
Is she transparent?
No.

407
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,661
I don't know what she looks like.

408
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,064
I've been looking for 10 years.

409
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,461
You say you know her, but
you don't know who she is?

410
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,547
And you don't know what she looks like.

411
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,785
Either youre a faithful idiot,
or just a plah idiot.

412
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,668
I would say you must be a faithful idiot.

413
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,822
Yes, your right.

414
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,181
Your friends must be helping you
find her.

415
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,946
Yes.

416
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,583
I want to help find her.
Great.

417
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,070
Rat!

418
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,147
Uncle.

419
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,419
Why are you always so late?

420
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,028
A woman knocked me out.

421
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,425
You lost your job yesterday for a woman.
Don't do the same again today.

422
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,504
You wouldn't understand.

423
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,587
Understand!
Keep away from women!

424
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,948
The Dollar has collapsed
Gold is soaring!

425
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,982
When is it my turn,
there'll be no more left.

426
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,782
Keep in line
10 silver dollars per person only!

427
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,218
I've stil got the scar from lining
you for rice.

428
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,101
My turn.
I was first.

429
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,787
Two more to go.

430
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,024
My head!
Are you ok?

431
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,628
Don't push.

432
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,821
The last time, it was on the left.
There, I was on the right.

433
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,497
Careful.

434
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,019
- Deoh't push.
- Comme onn.

435
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,264
No more, disperse!

436
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,744
Disperse, there's no more.

437
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,262
Are you alright?

438
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,908
I'm fihee.

439
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,658
That voice...

440
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,823
Can you say that again, "I'm fine"?

441
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:29,938
I'm fine.

442
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,900
Move along then if your fine!

443
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,988
What's wrong with him?
telling you to say I m fine, I'm fine!

444
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,898
Another woman?
You'd leave me to die for any woman.

445
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,145
It's not that.
It's her voice,

446
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,579
She seems so familiar from the back.

447
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,984
All woman look the same from behind.

448
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,021
From behind and the front too,
they all look the same!

449
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,421
They're looking for a school teacher!

450
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,861
I don't think the jobs right for you.
They get paid very little.

451
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,628
Little is better than nothing.

452
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,779
<i>CALENDAR QUEEN CONTEST</i>

453
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,139

00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,226

00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,307
I have it, I'm writing down the address.

458
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,382
Your doing it too?

459
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:34,148
I don't want to waste my life
dancing here.

460
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,942
Even if I lose,
I might meet a Rich man.

461
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,742
Here is your pencil.
I also wrote the address for you too.

462
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,621
I put it in your pocket.

463
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,105
Caendar Quueeh, Soy Sauce Queen!
Ahd seoeh, tthe Queen of rap!

464
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,823
I put it in this pocket.
Don't forget.

465
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,984
Don't waste your time.

466
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,498
You know how much
these American dollars are worth?

467
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,143
1,000 RMB

468
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,144
I'll give you two now.

469
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,585
Now, you'll have to do whatever I tell you.

470
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,065
Hey!

471
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,818
I always knew you were a creep,
but I didn t know you would sink so low.

472
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,544
Here's your money back

473
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,627
Shu Pei lin, don't try to get away!

474
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,020
This is too much!
Your a cradle robber.

475
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,947
Even 3 year olds would be scared of you!
Get out!

476
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,783
Gett ggoinng!

477
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,858
I...was too greedy.

478
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,187
You're not too greedy.
Don't cry, I understand.

479
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,379
What...what do you know?

480
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,780
You wanted this money
for your opium addicted father.

481
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,059
Here, take this.

482
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,381
Take it, if you run out,
just ask me for more.

483
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,580
The world is full of bad men
always out to get girls.

484
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,820
Who's the one who hurt my boyfriend?

485
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,825
Big...Big Boobs.

486
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,584
What's wrong with you?
Picking on my boyfriend?

487
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,465
Poor girl!
If only your brain was as large as your behind!

488
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,624
What?

489
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,502
The guy want's a girl like this.

490
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,703
No!

491
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,386
What do we do?

492
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,147
Let's see who has the brains now.

493
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,497
<i>Hee Hee Hee Ha Ha Ha</i>
<i>Hee Ha Ha Laughter.</i>

494
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,304
<i>Ha Ha Ha Hee Hee Hee</i>
<i>don't stop the laughter.</i>

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,865
<i>Have a laugh, you'll feel better!</i>

00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,107
<i>Don't be scared, Don't be frightened!</i>

497
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,066
<i>For the world to have peace!</i>

498
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,340
<i>Me and you laugh, please don't cease!</i>

499
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,897
<i>No money in the world can buy</i>
<i>laughter.</i>

500
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,339
<i>A smiling face, like love</i>
<i>is priceless.</i>

501
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,501
- Ceome here!
- Yes, Boss.

502
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,338
Send some flowers backstage on
behalf of Mr. Tou.

503
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,536
<i>Everytime you laugh, there are true feelings</i>.

504
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,992
<i>The whole world is laughing non stop!</i>
<i>There'll always be peace then!</i>

505
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,106
<i>Ha Ha Ha Hee Hee Hee laughter.</i>

<i>Non stop Laughter!</i>

508
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,426
On behalf of Mr. Tou.

509
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,905
He would like to take you out
for a late snack.

510
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,337
I only eat twice per day,
never late snacks.

511
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,700
You go eat with him.

512
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,218
It s ok we can have breakfast instead.

513
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,223
Is this enough?

514
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,987
American dollars.

515
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,507
If it comes so easy, I might as
well lie down for it!

516
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,744
That bitch!

517
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,578
Never insult a woman,
because ohe day she could be your boss.

518
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,461
Pick up the money.

519
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,500
Comrades.

520
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,177
Come sit down.

521
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,622
You found the girl?

522
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,740
Did you try the whorehouses?

523
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,348
Knock it off.

524
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,000
Have you eaten?
Not yet.

525
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,877
Eat with us.
We were waiting for Hairy Ape.

526
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,900
Here he comes now!

527
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,387
Hold this.
I'll light the fire.

528
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,457
What s wrong with him?
He just sold blood.

529
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,988
Sold blood?

530
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,386
This man gave his blood and passed out!
and you're sitting here happy!

531
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,228
We take turns selling blood for food?

532
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,104
Today, it's him,
tomorrow it'll be someone else.

533
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,745
Tomorrow it's my turn.
I have to eat a little bit more.

534
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,302
Or, I won't have any blood to give.

535
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,739
If I don't have blood to give.
I'll be dead too.

536
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,182
Will he be ok?
He just fainted.

537
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,380
Look at the bright lights of Shanghai.

538
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,182
You're blind. How can you see?
I imagine.

539
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,540
We didn't survive the war
just to die here.

540
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,705
Our time will come.

541
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,787
What s wrong with you?

542
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,184
I met a boy today.

543
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,500
Me too, what a coincidence.

544
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,862
When he smiles, he looks so silly, but
silly and yet so honest.

545
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:49,660
I...

546
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,987
He's the man of my Dreams, My Hero
My prince charming...

547
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,182
A beautiful prince with his white horse,
just like a fairy tale...

548
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,938
Hey! this is getting to be too much!

549
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,781
When did you come home?

550
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,619
I've been talking to you,
you didn't even notice me!

551
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,582
You have a fever?
No, it's me who s got the fever.

552
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,577
You may thihk I'm naive, but
I know about thihgs like this.

553
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,668
If you had met him today,
you'd be just the same way.

554
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,498
I think I'm really in love.

555
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,501
Have you got a cold?

556
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,824
No, I just cant bear hearing you talk anymore.

557
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,622
Yes... love really is unbearable.

558
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,467
Oh god!

559
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,748
I don't like sharing my bed.
Good night.

560
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,297
Guess who?

561
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,784
Uh... Stool.
You're so clever!

562
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,627
Guess who I'm.

563
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,217
You scared me.

564
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,977
C'mon smile.

565
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,864
I'm a walking AD today, and then...

566
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,831
I gotta go to the radio station
to see if they like my songs.

567
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,783
You'll become famous.

568
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:02,944
So what?

569
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,503
So, I ll give you a kiss.

570
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,104
It's very black.

571
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,582
And white too.

572
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,937
No!

573
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,097

Your prince charming is black?

583
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,827
What do you mean, black.

584
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,907
With you, everything that's white
turns black.

585
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,018
You've got a fever, are you sick.

586
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,544
I feel awful.
I'm hot and stuffy.

587
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,864
It's a good thing to be hot.

588
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,787
You should sweat it out, the hotter
the better.

589
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,025
You're burningg up.

590
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,185
You can't go to work today.

591
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,541
Work? I found you a job as a
teacher. The address is in my pocket.

592
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,584
You should go right away.

593
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,778
Is it that urgent?

594
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,047
<i>Kindergarten teacher needed.</i>

595
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:02,463
Is it the paper

596
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,706
Yes. Hurry or someone else will get the job.

597
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,267
Kindergarten?

598
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,180

It's the seventh year that
I ve done it. Maybe I'll get lucky.

624
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,501
Ready!

625
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,944
You got my back!
I wasn't ready yet!

00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,778
Come back next year.
Others are waiting.

Put on this swimsuit.

629
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,741
Is it a swimming test?
I saved somebody once in a river!

630
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,224
I don't care if you can swim,
it's your figure were looking at.

632

00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,865
Where are you going dressed like that?
What kind of kindergarten is this!?

640
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,303

Have a seat.

704
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,220
You should change
before you catch pneumonia.

705
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,627
But it's your pajamas!

706
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:21,901
You change back when your clothes are dry.

707
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,025
I'm afraid it will take forever.

708
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,503
Have some there are no pants.

709
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,381
There right here.

710
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,583
You lost al the buttons on this??

711
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,498
I forgot to tell you, they all
fell off.

712
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,659
I didn t see anything at all.

713
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,142
That means you saw everything!

714
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,146
Not everything, just a little...

715
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,059
Changed yet? Can I turn around?

716
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:05,417
Telling me to change and not closing the window!
What was that about?

717
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,824
I never close it when I change.

718
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,067
You planned this all out, didn't you?
Me like this! And You like that!

719
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,738
If somebody saw us,
I wonder what they would think.

720
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,218
Do re mi!

721
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,024
Do-re-mi Fa-so-la-si!

722
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,903
Looking for mne?

723
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,180
Hey, Stool!

724
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,708
Open up.

725
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,582
Don't open it, with me here.

726
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,778
I wont open it.

727
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,787
Don't look at me, look at her.

728
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,705
Why?

729
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:37,899
Why what?

730
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,424
I asked first.

731
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,460
With me like this, she can't see me.

732
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,907
We haven't done anything.

733
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,306
Exactly, you haven't done anything.
So hurry and open up.

734
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:48,739
You can't open the door.

735
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,505
I can't open the door!

736
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,943
Do re mi! If she sees me like this
were both dead!

737
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:58,865
Do re mi!

738
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,947
Tell her to leave.

739
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,948
Do re mi, where are you?

740
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,538
I'm coming. Stop shouting.

741
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,188
Stool, where are you?
Here.

742
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:21,137
You climbed through the window?
I'm used to it.

743
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,668
Not bad, huh?

744
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,739
By seeing you all black,
Shu got scared and sick.

745
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,383
She's very timid.
Don't scare her like that again.

746
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,097
<i>These people all look very familiar.</i>

747
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,941
<i>It's her!</i>

748
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:45,661
- What's that noise?
- A rat.

749
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,024
A rat?

750
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,505
Have some milk.
It's good for you.

751
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,698
Thank you.

752
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,300
You're so good to me.

753
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,822
I looked all day for a job.

754
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,782
I had no money for food.
I was so hungry.

755
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,133
Someone stole all my money.
I'm lucky Shu took me in.

756
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,905
It's all that thief's fault.

757
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,862
If I find him,
I'll wring his head off!

758
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,545
and make stuffed duck out of him!

759
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,824
I know who stole your money.

760
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,537
You do?

761
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:29,705
The money you had was...

762
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,744
Don't open the door!

763
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,588
It must be Shu
looking for me.

764
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,507
If she finds me here,
she ll make fun of me.

765
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,267
I've got to hide.

766
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,297
Play it by ear.

767
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,346
<i>I've got to play it by ear too!</i>

768
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,139
<i>We'll all have to play it by ear!</i>

769
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,698
Do re mi!

770
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,019
There you are
Wheres the money?

771
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:00,502
I spent it all!

772
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,178
On Tea, oil, sauce, rice etc...
Thanks to this money, I survived.

773
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,503
Take this.

774
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,744
I'm not talking to you!

775
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,384
Don't be mad.
You help me, I help you...

776
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,067
who knows what will happen from now on?

777
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,228
You couldn't have come
at a worse time.

778
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,101
Now, you've made it even worse.

779
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,547
I just took a little money from you.
We cant be friends anymore?

780
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,164
I should've never talked to you from day 1.

781
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,726
Are you nuts?
what are you talking about?

782
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,308
Show yourself!

783
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,979
Come on out, or I'll get you!

784
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,978
So it's you?

785
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,418
OOk... . Stool, come over here.

786
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,464
He's the one who took your money.

787
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,508
Give it back to me!

788
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,585
He s the one who spent it.

789
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,537
Why did you do that?

790
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,660
Give me back my money!

791
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,700
Why don't you give it back to him now?

792
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,818
Then where did my money go?

793
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,179
If you pay him back, then he
can pay you back.

794
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,424
Then who'll pay me back!?

795
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,858
lf he pays you back then you'll have money.

796
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,220
Give me back my money!

797
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,022
This is complicated!
But, that's not all.

798
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,016
You still haven't seen what's in here.

799
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,538
Come on out, lets all get complicated.

800
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,067
There is someone else?

801
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:12,808
Shu.

802
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,981
I don't believe this!

803
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,261
I thought we were friends.

804
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,506
I swear to you that nothing
happened between us.

805
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,304
You were both only almost naked together.

806
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,341
Look at you, you were wearing his pajamas.

807
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:42,066
He told me to put it on,
I didn't want to.

808
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,942
Told you?
what if he told you not to put anything on!

809
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,105
You want to steal him away from me.

810
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,587
It's not true.
Don't talk like that.

811
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:54,186
Not true! then, why were hiding
in the cupboard?

812
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,905
You were hiding too.

813
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,379
I...
What's that?

814
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,420
I am not as cheap and easy as you are.

815
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,108
What did you say?

816
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,026
I said "Cheap and Easy."

817
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:12,021
How dare you! You eat my food,
wear my clothes, live in my place.

818
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,788
If you want to move. Move!
Don't be a mooch!

819
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:18,785
I'll go far away.

820
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,302
I'm leaving now.

821
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,738
I wont be a much to you anymore.

822
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,104
I thought you left?

823
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:46,460
Shu.

824
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,786
Can I borrow some money for some food.

825
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,547
I haven't eaten anything all day.

826
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,387
Just a little.

827
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,257
I will pay you back one day.

828
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,700
If you want money,
go earn it.

829
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,104
Go on. Don't try to get pity from me.

830
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,099
Why> don't you go upstairs to him?

831
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,022
Why should I?
He's not my husband.

832
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,904
That one, I'll let you have him.

833
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:02,783
I can live without a man.

834
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,504
I don't want you to let me have him.

835
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,027
Don't worry,
I ve been waiting for someone for a long time.

836
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,902
Who?

837
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:37,581
Ah old friehd it's been ten years.
It's about time he came back for me.

838
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:43,303
That's good. Then now we won't fight.

839
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,024
Shu, let's not talk about men anymore.
It's all their fault.

840
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,424
Come...Let s go home.

841
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,547
I'll make something for us to eat.
I'm starving. Come!

842
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,857
My legs are weak.

843
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,183
Comrades!

844
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,742
There's no more blood left.

845
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,702
You don't have to worry.
Look what I brought.

846
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,224
Thank you Do re mi.

847
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,944
Light the fire, I'll cook them.

848
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:11,025
It s dirty.

849
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,382
Don't put all rice.
But I must!

850
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,979
We'll even eat the worms too.

851
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,101
We're going to have a true meal.

852
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,337
This girl is always down here.

853
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,107
Is she the one the tuba players looking for?

854
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,662
She has long hair though.

855
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,903
What is it?

856
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,667
Shu Pei In! How dare you do what you did?

857
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,225
One inch on the left
or one inch on the right.

858
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,340
On which side do you prefer?

859
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,300
To hell with you!

860
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,243
Go to hell!

861
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,387
Wrong guy, It's me.
Why didn't you say so.

862
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,340
Stop! Stop fighting!

863
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,666
You dirty bums fighting?

864
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,223
I haven't even eaten yet.

865
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:28,778
Attention!

866
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,867
Let's send these bums on their way!

867
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,820
How dare you stab me from behind?

868
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,620
Don't worry I'll pull it out.

869
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,987
Your going away pal.

870
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,546
Tear this place apart!

871
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,580
Hold this.

872
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,780
This time,
it looks as if we mush part.

873
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,140
Perhaps, we will see each other again
on the battle field.

874
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,101
- Tuba payer!
- Be quiet!

875
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,062
I have to tell him something.
Tell him on the battle field.

876
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:39,903
- You know these beggars?
- We were in the army together.

877
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,940
Let me do it.

878
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,939
You save me once again, we'd better
not meet again.

879
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,743
What did I do?

880
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,781
I think that you should treat Stool better.

881
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,425
What?

882
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,183
She is really good to you.

883
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,187
And me, I am nice to you.
Why aren't you good to me?

884
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,781
Lot's of men are nice to me,
you're just one more.

885
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,183
I get it.

886
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,777
You want to know how I feel about you.

887
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,218
What are you talking about?
I don't mean that!

888
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,943
When a woman says that,
she means the opposite.

889
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,228
Why don't you carve
two hearts on the wall!

890
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,227
You think you're Don Juan?
What do you take me for?

891
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:28,897
For a woman.

892
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:30,303
Rubish!

893
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,582
Did you find a job?

894
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,907
Want some milk?

895
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,071
You women think you're the best!

896
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,782
She's like that, and your like
this, pouting!

897
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,377
Hey I can be pouty too,
Look!

898
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:00,664
If you're such a big deal,
why did you come looking for me?

899
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,108
You want to throw a glass?
I can do that too.

900
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:12,621
why do you do that?
Ok, Throw my cups! Lets throw to them all!

901
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,542
Stop! mines smaller than yours.

902
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,466
Why are you mad at me?

903
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,466
You men look down on women!

904
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,137
If we don't bully you, you'll bully us!

905
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,988
Pouting all day long, even when
you're not even mad about anything!

906
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,579
Pouting day and night, even on the toilet...
To hell with it!

907
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,780
You want to fight?
put down the trophy and fight!

908
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,308
Very well, come on!

909
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:42,379
Out of breath?

910
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,740
If you're a man, stop moving.
And let me hit you.

911
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,700
I'm not as stupid as you women.

912
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,617
Please let me hit you once.
otherwise I'll feel awful.

913
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,578
Come on.

914
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,341
How did the bottle get there?

915
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,822
Do-re-mi, you ok?
I didn't mean it.

916
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:05,020
If you did't mean it, when you really do<
I'l die for sure!

917
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:08,698
Don't die... . I couldn't bear it.

918
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,697
Look at that one.

919
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,345
No, she's the best.

920
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,385
Not only are you good with money,

921
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,387
Your just as good at picking girls.
You have great taste.

922
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,307
Who has great taste?

923
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,222
You, Chairman Yu.

924
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:40,626
Chairman Yu,
what can I do for you?

925
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,106
Many Merchants have
sponsored this contest.

926
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,904
Remember that the contest is aimed
towards common housewives.

927
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,178
Of couurse.

928
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,177
These girls look like whores.

929
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,462
Chairmah Yu.

930
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:03,867
They are the ones that we eliminated.

931
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,584
I know. I paid the most money to win this contest.

932
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,782
So, I'll get to pick who I please!
This one!

933
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,144
Uncle you really want to move
to the south Pacific?

934
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,827
I almost have enough money.

935
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,541
Careful!

936
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,862
I'll try to help you.

937
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,948
If you looked at fewer girls,
I would be fine.

938
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,657
"South Pacific"

939
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,626
We have to go to work, uncle.

940
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:47,507
I'll take you along with me.
Away from this poverty!

941
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,339
Uncle, same as usual?

942
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,064
No. I can't take it anymore,
you do it.

943
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,421
A gift for any purchase!

944
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,143
The more you buy,
the more gifts you have!

945
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,737
Without you, the old man
would have been less generous.

946
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,463
Enjoy it.
It's expensive stuff!

947
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:23,946
With all that I bought you,
Don't I desenrve a kiss?

948
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:26,185

949
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,020
And you? Come on!

950
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,342
This side too.

951
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:48,345
Let's get in.

952
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,617
Let's go.

953
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,221
Harder!

954
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:07,181
If you don't come out I'l colapsee.

955
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:20,027
If you're nice,
I'll buy the entire street for you.

956
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,377
What are you looking at?
We're working! It's my turn!

957
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:33,468
Shu Pei lin, why are you so quiet?

958
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,502
Watch it! my hand still hurts.

959
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,745
Stop the car! I'm getting out!

960
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,507
It's dangerous.

961
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,508
Someone's hurt, don't steal my cotton!

962
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,540
Where you going?
She's my friend.

01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,383
How is your leg?

965
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,027
We have to take her to the hospital.

966
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,185
Careful.

967
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,219
Careful.
Don't hurt her leg.

968
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,184
Are you alright?

969
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,906
I'm fine.
You can go back to work.

970
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,740
Young man, well done.

01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:43,260
Don't worry we'll be at the hospital soon.

977
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:53,582
Atfter my cott oh again!

978
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:57,224

979
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,747
Uncle!

980
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,265
Come out.

981
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,187
Where did you go this time?

982
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,546
I could've suffocated in there.

983
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,546
Let me put some oil on you.

984
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,382
Here, are you ok?

985
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,625
I'm fine.
Then let's get back to work.

986
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:19,900
What job?
We got fired once again.

987
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:24,825
The south Pacific!
I can't even buy my ticket now to go there.

988
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:27,185
You see what you do to me?

989
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,988
Shu.

990
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,667
You need to take some rest, don't
stand on that leg.

991
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,586
Have some tea.

992
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:46,226
He... He's here again.

993
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:51,944
Come here.

994
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:07,746
Miss...Miss asks you
to cool the tea.

995
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,060
You're still here?

996
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,704
I have something to say to you.

997
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,983
I leave Shanghai in two days.

998
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,224
Where are you going?

999
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:27,341
To Hong Kong. Someone asked me
to open a cabaret there.

1000
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:30,063
Hohg Kong?? how is it there?

1001
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,620
A real melting pot of people.

1002
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:35,582
An ideal place
for a man of my talents.

1003
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,546
Then, congratulations.

1004
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,541
Shu Pei lin.

1005
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,265
I wonder why
nobody wants this ring.

1006
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:48,779
We're not made for each other.

1007
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:52,339
I know that I'm a litte over the hill.

1008
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:55,505
Don't I have any hope at all?

1009
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,067
I have hope.

1010
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,987
If I give it to you,
I wont have anymore.

1011
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,503
Don't move!

1012
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,699
You're hurt. You shouldn't move.

1013
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:11,818
My plant!

1014
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,304
Why aren't you resting.

1015
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,181
Go lie down.

1016
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,858
My leg.
don't move.

1017
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,584
Shu, I've been thinking.

1018
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,862
I'l find a job and we'll
have a menage a trois.

1019
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:33,505
What a menage a trois?

1020
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:37,383
You, me, and then Do-re-mi.
The three of us.

1021
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:42,382
You and him can, butt leave me out of it.

1022
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,384
Don't ever get into my line of work.

1023
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,898
It's enough that one of us is doing it.

1024
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,102
Once your in, it's hard to find a good husband.

1025
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:56,778
Don't worry, I would never
get into your line of work.

1026
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,457
Don't forget.
That you can't move, Ok.

1027
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:00,988
I know.

1028
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,225
I told you not to move.

1029
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,498
I won't move anymore.

1030
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:08,938
Come here!
Don't move either.

1031
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,104
The Calendar Queen is missing.
$10 miIIion dollar reward for who finds her.

1032
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,985

1035
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,218

1036
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:37,587

01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,542
But, there's a reward of $10 million.

1040

$10 million? That much?

1041
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,024
If only I had that much money.

1042
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:52,945
It's her!

1053
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,299
I'm the new Calendar Queen!

1054
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,982
Look they offered a reward of
$10 million to find me!

1055
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,906
If only we could have all that money.

1056
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,858
That car is coming for me.

1057
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,991
Gentlemen of the press, execuse me.

1058
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,227
I have to go.

1059
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,866
This evening, remember not to drink,
stay sober.

1060
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,661
Ok, I ll remember not to drink.

1061
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:22,659
Gentlemen, let's welcome
The New Calendar Queen.

1062
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,539
Let me introduce myself.

1063
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,987
I own a match factory.
this is the Match Queen.

1064
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,861
I have a chicken farm.

1065
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:04,624
May I present to you.
The Chicken Queen.

1066
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,023
It's my turn now.

1067
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:09,300
I sell toilet paper.
This is The Queen of Toilet Paper.

1068
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,137
How are you.

1069
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,021
The Milk Queen, toothpick Queen...

1070
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:15,105
The queen of Light bulbs, the D.D.T.

1071
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,584
The Soap Queen,
this queen, that queen.

1072
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:27,097
She still knows how to smile.

1073
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,019
Your uncle is a total idiot...,
an idiot...

1074
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,105
a blithering idiot..., an idiot...

1075
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,901
Are you talking about me?

1076
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:39,578
No I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about your imbecile uncle.

1077
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:41,777
One moment.

1078
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,299
He doesn't even have money for food,
but yet he wants to move to the south!

1079
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:47,621
Uncle!

1080
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:50,263
Wait for me.
I don't have anything any more.

1081
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,186
<i>ORIENTAL BROTHEL</i>

1082
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,664
Hey there, let's go have some fun.

1083
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,381
Uncle!

1084
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,383
What are you doing?

1085
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,658
Give that back.

1086
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,780
This is hard earned money.

1087
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:04,979
I've no more hope anyway.

1088
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:08,545
You think only of the girls all the time,
it's my turn now.

1089
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,546
You could catch a disease.

1090
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,979
That's better than catching your rooten luck.

1091
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,418
Here, for you.
Let's have fun.

1092
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,426
Uncle, listen to me!

1093
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,699
I know a way to help you leave.

1094
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,865
You want to get rid of me?

1095
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:24,707
Let's go!
Uncle!

1096
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,944
Your crushing my feet.

1097
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,227
You trying to get her drunk?

1098
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:53,864
Of course, I'm preparing her for
the Boss.

1099
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:56,827
Remember which glass to give her.

1100
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:00,943
Chairmah Yu.

1101
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,947
Wait...

1102
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:08,424
Are you the new girl?

1103
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:12,345
You look just like my sister.

1104
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,347
Sister?

1105
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,017
That's so wonderful

1106
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,105
Come, Let's drink to that.

1107
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:24,984
Leave this Cognac. At such an event,
should be celebrated with Champagne.

1108
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,178
Champagne!

1109
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,380
And this toast is to you all...
Did you give her the right glass?

1110
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,778
That drink really got me.

1111
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:02,382
Only one glass of champagne
and here she is drunk.

1112
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,546
I wasted a sleeping pill.

1113
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:23,497
I want to have a menage a trois!

1114
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:29,737
I feel dizzy, how will I get home?

1115
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,664
Boss, she's all ready for you.

1116
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:43,904
Power Failure, I'll go get a candle.

1117
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:46,338
Don't bother.

1118
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:49,222
It's even better in the dark.

1119
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,418
Yes, sir.

1120
01:21:58,440 --> 01:21:59,498
Power failure?

1121
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:18,470
The goldfish.

1122
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:28,458
What's the matter?

1123
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:29,738
Help me!

1124
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,822
I'll be right there!

1125
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:33,665
Where are you?

1126
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,418
Don't move.

1127
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:38,977
What is it?

1128
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:40,704
You can move now.

1129
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,507
- You were screaming for help?
- Because of fish.

1130
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:47,984
Fish?
It will die.

1131
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,100
Quick get something to put him in.

1132
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,543
It's cooler up here,
not as stuffy as downstairs.

1133
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:59,183
With this Power failure,
You can't see anything.

1134
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,299
It's better than that night ten years ago.

1135
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,661
Ten years ago?

1136
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,786
Don't you remember?

1137
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:09,947
When Shanghai...

1138
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:12,219
Was bombed by the Japanese.
10 years ago.

1139
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,067
It was chaos in the streets.

1140
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:17,700
I was all alone,
I was very afraid.

1141
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,983
Me too.

1142
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:22,581
I pushed somebody under a bridge.

1143
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:26,986
It was worse for me,
I was pushed under a bridge.

1144
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:32,937
It was so dangerous, so we hid
underneath that bridge.

1145
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,951
He wouldn't let me leave to go
back home to Zhabei.

1146
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:36,502
Zhabei?

1147
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,185
He was carrying a violin.

1148
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:44,379
She was carrying an umbrella.

1149
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:50,260
He said he was going to fight in the war.
He even gave me his money.

1150
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,380
She even gave him a farewell kiss.

1151
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,617
It was you?

1152
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,827
I've finally found you.

1153
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,221
I can't believe this.

1154
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:06,537
Is it really you?

1155
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,222
Why didn't we recognize each other
earlier?

1156
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,657
It's not to late, now.

1157
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:15,097
Shu Pei lin.

1158
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,108
The power is back on.

1159
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,627
Your leg.

1160
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,340
These gold bars are really heavy.

1161
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,339
How did I end up under here?

1162
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,778
How come you're here?

1163
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,217
Then...

1164
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,944
Chairman Yu?

1165
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:25,143
Quiet, there'll be big trouble
if she wakes up now.

1166
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,907
Let's go.

1167
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:33,588
A burglar?

1168
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,217
Boss, there's a problem.

1169
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:43,782
I'm glad you already know, come in.

1170
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,625
Take off your jacket.
My jacket.

1171
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,266
Your pants too.
My pants.

1172
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:52,488
Go in the bed.

1173
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,465
Boss, I don't swing that way.

1174
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:58,457
Not with me, idiot.
With that girl in bed!

1175
01:25:58,680 --> 01:25:59,578
The Calendar Queen?
Yes.

1176
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:01,825
Thank you, Boss.
Go ahead.

1177
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,143
Thank you, Boss.

1178
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,863
You realy look after me well.

1179
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:19,181
I didn't do anything wrong?
Why do this to me?

1180
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:20,185
In the bed!

1181
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,099
If you don't, I'll shoot you.

1182
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,624
The gun!
Don't move!

1183
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:44,659
Boss, look out!

1184
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:55,741
Your'e so naughty.

1185
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:59,908
I've been a widow for so long.
tonight I'm a new woman.

1186
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:02,418
My god!

1187
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:08,018
Don't be shy, What's done is done.

1188
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:11,220
As long as you take the responsibility.
Come.

1189
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:14,466
How can I face people again?

1190
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:19,979
See you tonight!

1191
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:21,898
See you tonight!

1192
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:31,301
I'm rich!

1193
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,347
My foot...

1194
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,227
Shu, Listen to Me.

1195
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,341
Yesterday evening, I learned
many things about life.

1196
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,744
Right, You didn't come home.

1197
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,066
That's right, I was drunk.

1198
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:51,980
When I woke up,
I saw that man named Tou, he...

1199
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,908
He was lying on the bed, naked.

1200
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:04,822
Beside him, there was
a rich, naked woman too.

1201
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:09,705
This dumb guy came in, he took
his clothes off and got in bed.

1202
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,219
They were all in this mess and the
gun went off.

1203
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:14,705
Who shot the gun?

1204
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:16,387
Me.

1205
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,898
Let me finish my story, please.

1206
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:22,463
Looks at this! $ 90 million.

1207
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:26,778
This is the prize money, We're rich!

1208
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,900
We're rich.

1209
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:33,500
With this money, we can setup our
menage a trois, and live together.

1210
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,182
A menage a trois?

1211
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,903
You, me and Do-re-mi.

1212
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,823
This money can help his uncle so...

1213
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,588
He can leave for the South Pacific.

1214
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:46,465
Then we can get married.

1215
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:48,459
Get married?

1216
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,386
That's right, get married.

1217
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:53,068
The three of us will all live together.

1218
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:57,023
Do-re-mi and me, and I'll treat you like
a real sister.

1219
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,619
Diddn'tt you saYy e're ikke sisters before?

1220
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:06,227
What's wrong with you?

1221
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:09,108
Shu.

1222
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,985
You have something to say to me?

1223
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,584
You want to tell me now?

1224
01:29:17,240 --> 01:29:21,017
You don't have ahything to say?
You should be congratulating me?

1225
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:29,418
Congratulations.
The 2 of you will be really happy.

1226
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,187
Thank you, Shu.

1227
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,781
The fish died.

1228
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:41,307
At our time,
