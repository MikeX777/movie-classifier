1
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:51,567
Well, Steve?

2
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:54,671
What happened?

3
00:04:55,802 --> 00:04:58,238
A car accident...

4
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,699
I can't bend it.

5
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:03,490
I don't bend it anymore.

6
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:07,000
How did it go for you?
-I'd say it went well...

7
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:09,801
They left us in peace.

8
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:12,742
We did everything as planned.

9
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:19,402
Boris as well, though...

10
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,162
He chose a really nice house.

11
00:05:22,163 --> 00:05:27,241
But the idea to reunite here,
at the end of the carnival...

12
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:32,295
Worked out well.

13
00:05:32,596 --> 00:05:37,147
It will be easier to leave
without being noticed.

14
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:42,360
It really is beautiful.

15
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:49,293
But Boris...
Where is he?

16
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:54,799
What a way to receive guests.

17
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:59,916
Why are you here, beautiful lady?

18
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:04,200
Good evening, gentlemen.

19
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:30,322
Great, here's another one.

20
00:06:31,815 --> 00:06:34,791
(?) of women.

21
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:41,325
And Boris?
-He's dead.

22
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:43,865
He's dead?
-Yes.

23
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:47,433
A viral infection.
I'm representing him, I'm his wife.

24
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:51,500
Sorry, I'm Boris' widow.
-And the valuables?

25
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:54,329
Entrusted to me.

26
00:06:55,678 --> 00:06:59,021
Klaus, from Hamburg...

27
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:02,878
Albert.
-From Marseille.

28
00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:06,522
Boris told me about you.

29
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:10,280
Steve, from London.

30
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:13,684
Carina, from Tangiers.
-I came, Omar is in hiding.

31
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:17,861
We know, he told us.
Thomas, Dutch.

32
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,160
Juan...

33
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:23,314
I'm not Dutch,
I'm Spanish.

34
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:26,632
My credentials,
and the key...

35
00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:31,592
We played poker.
Me, and our friend Thomas...

36
00:07:31,593 --> 00:07:35,050
He lost and I won.

37
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:38,612
But how exactly did you win?

38
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:43,985
It's not important.
-Good, we're all here.

39
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:48,423
And who is she?
-Jeanine...

40
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:51,085
My fiancÃ©e.

41
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:55,578
But who gave you permission
to bring her?

42
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:57,926
Permission?

43
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:02,985
I have more right to be here than you.
And she's with me...

44
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:06,897
If you don't like it (?) for you.
-That wasn't the deal.

45
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:11,289
We had to come here alone.
-I don't have to answer to you.

46
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,678
No, you have to answer to
all of us in the group.

47
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:19,490
You make me die of laughter.

48
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:23,129
Your group?
You're dealers...

49
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,574
The ones they send to
carry out the jobs...

50
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:29,555
I did all the work.
You weren't there that night...

51
00:08:29,556 --> 00:08:33,178
And you're here for the poker.
But I was there...

52
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,618
And if they caught me I couldn't
even give them your names.

53
00:08:40,316 --> 00:08:42,964
You may well be big diamond dealers...

54
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:46,347
But you can't say anything to me,
only Boris can.

55
00:08:46,348 --> 00:08:49,484
But it seems like he's dead.
She says so.

56
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:52,130
Or the boss.

57
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:56,190
But he's out of the game now,
and he's been paid.

58
00:08:56,191 --> 00:09:00,039
You've took part in this robbery because
you're an expert in strong rooms...

59
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,574
Like the one in the Amsterdam bank.

60
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:08,235
If this was about contraband,
drugs or money...

61
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:13,412
We'd have left you to your nightclubs,
to your women.

62
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:18,261
Okay, I'm useful to you because I
knew the bank of Amsterdam...

63
00:09:18,262 --> 00:09:20,317
In that case...

64
00:09:20,318 --> 00:09:22,506
Take me as I am.

65
00:09:22,507 --> 00:09:24,391
Yes, yes...

66
00:09:24,592 --> 00:09:27,769
Nice discussion.
But what do we do with her?

67
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,299
That's right, what do we do?
Omar says we must hurry...

68
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,148
He says luck is like the wind,
it changes.

69
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:37,878
Send her away.
-Alright, we must eliminate her.

70
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:41,065
Albert, Albert!

71
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:44,822
Or we can trust her.
-Trust her?

72
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:47,810
It's very dangerous.

73
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:51,175
I don't like these jokes.

74
00:09:51,176 --> 00:09:54,896
I couldn't care less about your tastes,
stop acting like a fool.

75
00:09:55,622 --> 00:09:57,848
You seem like a band of
fools to me...

76
00:09:57,849 --> 00:10:01,385
Leave Janine alone and let's think
 about where we can find Boris.

77
00:10:01,386 --> 00:10:05,044
Boris is dead.
-Dead? What if you killed him instead?

78
00:10:05,045 --> 00:10:07,906
It's all very simple, my dear Albert...

79
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:11,538
Outside in the park,
there's a lovely tomb...

80
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:15,671
You'll find Boris in there.

81
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:19,236
Outside in the park?
(?) in a park.

82
00:10:19,237 --> 00:10:22,456
Right, but what were you expecting?
A beautiful funeral ceremony...

83
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:24,941
With a notice in the paper,
and a band?

84
00:10:24,942 --> 00:10:28,104
Don't talk rubbish, the important
thing is I've got his key...

85
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:31,689
So we can go to the safe.

86
00:11:00,443 --> 00:11:02,691
Lead?
-Yes.

87
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:05,161
Yes...

88
00:11:05,162 --> 00:11:08,606
Lead.
-It was the boss' idea...

89
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:11,869
He knew how to do it.
-Nice.

90
00:11:12,317 --> 00:11:16,227
How long has it been since
the Amsterdam job?

91
00:11:16,228 --> 00:11:18,736
Eleven months.

92
00:11:18,737 --> 00:11:22,858
And in all this time no one
thought about Boris...

93
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:26,125
To get him to blow it open?
-Yes, bravo...

94
00:11:26,126 --> 00:11:28,302
Do you think the boss is an imbecile?

95
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:31,847
He couldn't put his hands on the
diamonds for fifty years.

96
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:34,291
Radioactivity...

97
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:37,196
There's a cavity lined with uranium.

98
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:41,549
Only our six keys can open it.

99
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:44,169
Here's Boris' key.

100
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,602
Gentlemen, yours.

101
00:12:52,256 --> 00:12:56,069
I warned you not to try
 anything funny.

102
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,530
But I've got it.
I've got it.

103
00:12:58,531 --> 00:13:00,146
Let go of me.

104
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:04,224
What were you thinking, Albert?
We don't have time for your riddles.

105
00:13:04,225 --> 00:13:07,141
I tell you I had it.
-What are your intentions?

106
00:13:07,142 --> 00:13:10,388
Now you're exaggerating.
You're taking a big risk.

107
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,104
Let go of me.

108
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:14,066
I'll find it.

109
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:17,616
Even if it's under your skin.
-Stop, cut it out.

110
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:20,934
You're an asshole.

111
00:13:32,506 --> 00:13:34,748
And Jeanine?

112
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,519
I haven't hidden it.
I swear.

113
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,513
You'd better pray to God I find it,
because I give you my word...

114
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:45,688
I'll kill you.
Damned French.

115
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:48,124
No.
Let go of me.

116
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,790
Albert.

117
00:13:49,891 --> 00:13:51,851
Jeanine!

118
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,738
You're hurting me.

119
00:13:54,739 --> 00:13:57,024
I don't know anything.

120
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:59,728
Let go of me,
I haven't got the key.

121
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:02,492
We'll see.
-I swear I haven't got it.

122
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,173
Don't touch me.

123
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:17,542
What has she got to do with it?
I had the key...

124
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:20,570
Jeanine can't have taken it.
Leave her alone.

125
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:27,621
You're pigs.
But you'll pay for this.

126
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:34,043
Everyone's against me.

127
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,362
Let go of me.

128
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:05,953
Do you see that I don't have it?

129
00:15:05,954 --> 00:15:09,398
He had it.
Albert had it.

130
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:20,230
You also knew it was in my
cigarette case...

131
00:15:20,231 --> 00:15:22,997
So where is it?

132
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:26,921
I don't know.
I...

133
00:15:26,922 --> 00:15:29,635
...don't know.
-Enough.

134
00:15:29,636 --> 00:15:32,774
Gentlemen, your rooms are upstairs...

135
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:36,148
Call me if there are any developments.

136
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:39,050
Child...

137
00:15:39,602 --> 00:15:42,982
I won't allow you to make a fool of us.

138
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:50,487
What do you want in return
for the key?

139
00:15:50,488 --> 00:15:52,509
What do you want?

140
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:57,106
If you plan on having fun,
look.

141
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,435
No, Steve.
Give them to me.

142
00:16:02,377 --> 00:16:04,175
You can't Klaus...

143
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:06,129
I'm begging you.
No, Klaus.

144
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,697
You can't do this.
I'm begging you.

145
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:11,461
I'll go crazy.
Please, Klaus.

146
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:16,444
This is the price of your key.
Well done, Steve.

147
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:21,239
I'm sick.

148
00:18:04,998 --> 00:18:07,479
Cover yourself.

149
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:13,217
You know who took it, right?

150
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:23,629
How did it happen?
Who took it from me?

151
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,130
It wasn't you.
I know.

152
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:33,629
Did they hurt you?

153
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,363
Help.
Help me!

154
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:43,156
Who took it?

155
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:52,114
Tell Klaus to give it to me.
I need it...

156
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:55,187
I can't stand it.

157
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:13,238
Give it to me.
-Out with the key.

158
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:16,775
I can't find it anymore.
I had it in my cigarette case...

159
00:19:17,936 --> 00:19:21,385
We'll have a good look for it tomorrow,
outside in the park...

160
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:24,801
When I got out of the car,
perhaps...

161
00:19:24,802 --> 00:19:27,818
I had it.
I had it!

162
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:42,149
Steve, make him give it to me.

163
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:46,677
Have you hidden it?
-No...

164
00:19:47,318 --> 00:19:49,941
Why did I come all the
way here then?

165
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:52,579
Make him give it to me,
I'm begging you.

166
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,524
You know me, Steve.
You're my friend...

167
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:58,823
You know I'm not a thief,
we worked together...

168
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:01,612
You remember don't you?
Steve!

169
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:04,979
You weren't a drug addict then.
-Klaus.

170
00:20:39,828 --> 00:20:42,036
Stop.

171
00:20:42,516 --> 00:20:45,125
We're wasting time here.

172
00:20:45,126 --> 00:20:48,608
I've already taken precise measures...

173
00:20:50,305 --> 00:20:53,144
And you, Steve?

174
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:56,763
My part has already been
sold in London.

175
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:01,039
And you?
Juan.

176
00:21:05,573 --> 00:21:07,795
Do you have any suggestions?

177
00:21:07,796 --> 00:21:12,248
The safe must be opened.

178
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:15,539
Good, and how?

179
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,171
With a magic wand?

180
00:21:18,172 --> 00:21:20,616
All we need to do is create a 
mould to create a new key.

181
00:21:20,617 --> 00:21:23,806
Klaus, why didn't I think of it before?

182
00:21:23,807 --> 00:21:28,484
And you believe that if it was
possible to make...

183
00:21:28,485 --> 00:21:30,595
...a mould...

184
00:21:30,596 --> 00:21:35,676
We would've trusted Boris
to look after the safe?

185
00:21:35,677 --> 00:21:38,102
I'm not interested in what
Boris could've done...

186
00:21:38,103 --> 00:21:41,520
I've made moulds before,
I'll open the safe for you.

187
00:21:41,521 --> 00:21:44,226
Give it to me.

188
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:57,613
Very well, I believe you.

189
00:21:57,614 --> 00:22:00,408
Here it is.

190
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,263
The light is hurting me.

191
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:21,583
Stop it, Juan.

192
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:54,121
Stand up.

193
00:23:54,122 --> 00:23:56,033
My child...

194
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:59,372
You have something to tell us, right?

195
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:03,472
What do you want to tell us?
Come on.

196
00:24:04,101 --> 00:24:06,623
Still nothing?

197
00:24:07,353 --> 00:24:11,188
You're still stuck on this idea
 of making a mould.

198
00:24:57,967 --> 00:25:00,090
Steve.

199
00:25:06,282 --> 00:25:10,651
You have to give it to me.

200
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:16,542
Klaus.
Klaus, where are you?

201
00:25:53,234 --> 00:25:57,725
I'll make the key for you.
We'll get the diamonds.

202
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:00,963
I'll make the key for you.

203
00:26:01,164 --> 00:26:03,348
I'm begging you.

204
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,915
Klaus!

205
00:26:53,303 --> 00:26:56,273
Happy carnival, grandpa.

206
00:27:12,693 --> 00:27:15,547
Who is it?
-Callagan.

207
00:28:25,364 --> 00:28:29,519
What if Albert didn't kill himself?

208
00:28:29,982 --> 00:28:33,256
Then it means there's a murderer
amongst us, right?

209
00:28:33,257 --> 00:28:35,725
Do you ever use your brain?

210
00:28:35,726 --> 00:28:38,968
I'm starting to feel tired,
this should've been over in a few hours.

211
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:40,977
But here we are...

212
00:28:40,978 --> 00:28:43,917
We're all stuck in this 
damned mess...

213
00:28:43,918 --> 00:28:46,446
With a key in my hand and a dead
body on my conscience...

214
00:28:46,447 --> 00:28:49,553
It really doesn't leave me
feeling enthusiastic.

215
00:28:50,053 --> 00:28:52,461
Nervous?

216
00:28:52,762 --> 00:28:56,561
Perhaps you went too far with Albert?

217
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:01,292
His suicide might complicate
matters for the worst.

218
00:29:01,293 --> 00:29:04,012
If it was suicide...

219
00:29:04,013 --> 00:29:08,616
Why didn't he pull out the key?
-I'm certain he didn't have it anymore.

220
00:29:08,617 --> 00:29:11,598
We'll never know the truth.

221
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,355
Do you have any ideas?
-No, and you?

222
00:29:14,356 --> 00:29:17,311
We risk being stuck in here
for a long time.

223
00:29:17,312 --> 00:29:21,041
If you really want to know,
I'm starting to miss Boris...

224
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:24,351
Maybe we'll never open that safe.

225
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:29,457
Albert's gone.

226
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:33,237
If we manage to open that little box...

227
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:35,814
We'll have to divide into five parts.

228
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:40,449
But no mistakes, you're the expert
and you have to be impartial...

229
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,167
Understood?

230
00:29:46,025 --> 00:29:50,087
I'm falling to pieces.
I can't stand this any more.

231
00:29:52,864 --> 00:29:56,485
I'm leaving.
-And what will Omar say?

232
00:29:56,486 --> 00:30:00,428
Do you want to decide for him?
-Then let's do something...

233
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:03,501
There must be a solution,
what are we waiting for?

234
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:07,945
The sixth key.
I get the impression it's here.

235
00:30:09,993 --> 00:30:13,530
You don't have two by any chance?

236
00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:18,129
Stupid.

237
00:30:20,293 --> 00:30:25,267
I must get in contact with Omar,
he'll to me what the hell I should do.

238
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,408
I'd like to make a call.
-There aren't any telephones here.

239
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:40,377
No?

240
00:30:40,811 --> 00:30:42,819
And in the village?

241
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,873
I think so.
-I need someone to accompany me.

242
00:30:45,874 --> 00:30:47,990
No!
-Carina.

243
00:30:47,991 --> 00:30:50,809
Are we prisoners?

244
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,468
I asked for a telephone
and there isn't one.

245
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:56,646
There isn't one because
we don't need it.

246
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:59,896
I asked to be taken to a public
telephone and she said no.

247
00:30:59,897 --> 00:31:02,316
We're inside a china cabinet, yes...

248
00:31:02,317 --> 00:31:05,656
And anything can send
this all to pieces...

249
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:09,588
Let's try not to make any
brisk movements.

250
00:31:13,732 --> 00:31:17,547
Who did you want to talk to?
-That's my business.

251
00:31:18,062 --> 00:31:22,176
I'm free to talk to whoever
I want to, no?

252
00:31:44,328 --> 00:31:46,608
Good day.

253
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:01,548
Biscuits, brioche...

254
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:04,729
Chocolates and cream.

255
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:13,384
Then I wasn't mistaken...

256
00:32:13,385 --> 00:32:16,864
You're also greedy.

257
00:32:17,344 --> 00:32:20,353
A man's shirt?

258
00:32:21,415 --> 00:32:25,825
It was his.
Where will they put him?

259
00:32:27,719 --> 00:32:31,177
He's downstairs in the garage,
he doesn't have anymore worries...

260
00:32:31,178 --> 00:32:35,519
He doesn't shout anymore.
He was luckier than us.

261
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,401
How could he?
He was so scared of dying.

262
00:32:45,962 --> 00:32:50,773
Would it be indiscrete to ask you
if you've made any alliances?

263
00:32:54,485 --> 00:32:56,882
Who with?

264
00:32:56,883 --> 00:32:59,348
With Anna.

265
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:11,520
And if I were?
You seem to be very close to Steve.

266
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,597
We were discussing the situation.
-Yes, yes...

267
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:21,765
A lot of discussion,
but no one has any good ideas.

268
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,349
Who owns this villa?

269
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,759
Boris bought it.

270
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,236
It's that tomb that doesn't
say much to me.

271
00:33:32,792 --> 00:33:35,885
Boris wasn't my husband.

272
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,755
But it's as though he was.

273
00:33:40,668 --> 00:33:43,700
What was he like?

274
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,692
He was somone who liked me.

275
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:54,806
I'm starting to have my suspicions.

276
00:33:56,818 --> 00:33:59,811
Do you think you know who
has Albert's key?

277
00:33:59,812 --> 00:34:02,132
Not yet.

278
00:34:02,517 --> 00:34:06,663
I'm thinking about Boris.
He wasn't your husband...

279
00:34:06,664 --> 00:34:09,908
You could have killed him...

280
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:12,876
He might not be dead.

281
00:34:12,877 --> 00:34:15,740
It is possible I could
have killed him...

282
00:34:15,741 --> 00:34:18,809
You can even think it.

283
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:22,615
But if you think he isn't dead...

284
00:34:23,016 --> 00:34:25,766
Open it.

285
00:34:27,735 --> 00:34:30,655
Now I disgust you, right?

286
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:33,324
It's always like that after.

287
00:34:33,325 --> 00:34:37,222
You all have the same reaction.
Just say it...

288
00:34:37,223 --> 00:34:39,617
I won't feel offended.

289
00:34:39,618 --> 00:34:43,961
You won't be the first to tell me.

290
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,600
But you women always get it wrong...

291
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:52,662
You should be disgusted with
drug addicts, the weak...

292
00:34:52,663 --> 00:34:55,841
Like Albert.

293
00:34:57,027 --> 00:34:59,372
Albert, what a guy...

294
00:34:59,373 --> 00:35:01,871
I don't know what your
friend was thinking...

295
00:35:01,872 --> 00:35:05,847
But if I manage to find (?)

296
00:35:05,848 --> 00:35:08,961
What have the others done?
-They haven't done anything...

297
00:35:08,962 --> 00:35:13,265
That's the problem.
They don't think, they don't move...

298
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:16,959
They wait.
They spy on each other.

299
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,913
I'd like to provoke them.

300
00:35:19,914 --> 00:35:24,139
What if the others killed you?
-With what advantage?

301
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,536
It's Albert's key that's missing.

302
00:35:30,376 --> 00:35:33,145
Tell me something...

303
00:35:34,059 --> 00:35:37,563
Did you see anyone follow
Albert into his room?

304
00:35:37,564 --> 00:35:39,787
Did you hear anything?
-No...

305
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:42,997
All I heard was his scream.
Do you think someone killed him?

306
00:35:42,998 --> 00:35:45,040
If that's the case then
we're all in danger...

307
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:47,816
I want to leave.

308
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:26,364
Hello?

309
00:37:26,365 --> 00:37:29,905
I killed Albert.
You can come.

310
00:37:29,906 --> 00:37:33,959
I'm thinking of leaving tonight.
Over and out...

311
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,784
You can talk.

312
00:37:49,536 --> 00:37:53,435
Boris, Steve, can you hear me?

313
00:38:03,209 --> 00:38:05,069
Omar.

314
00:38:05,954 --> 00:38:07,889
Listen to me.

315
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,322
Listen to me!

316
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:14,689
I'm the boss.
I have some good news for you...

317
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,877
It's pointless looking
for Albert's key...

318
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:20,586
I have it.

319
00:38:22,578 --> 00:38:26,447
Albert, you're very distracted...

320
00:38:26,448 --> 00:38:30,300
You left without it.
You didn't pay me properly...

321
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:32,788
And you treated me even worse...

322
00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:37,704
No one has ever treated
me so stupidly.

323
00:38:37,705 --> 00:38:42,036
I prepared all of the most
sensational robberies...

324
00:38:42,037 --> 00:38:47,391
The pounds from Glasgow,
the Third Reich's treasure.

325
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:52,444
Omar, Steve, Boris...

326
00:38:54,297 --> 00:38:56,412
Listen up...

327
00:38:56,468 --> 00:39:00,104
I want half of the diamonds.

328
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:04,051
This is the price of Albert's key.

329
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:07,541
Jeanine!
-I'll return tomorrow morning...

330
00:39:08,614 --> 00:39:12,014
It's your radio!

331
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:16,254
It's yours, isn't it?
-No, it was Albert's.

332
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:18,637
Talk!
You know something.

333
00:39:18,638 --> 00:39:21,446
I don't know anything.
-I'll kill you.

334
00:39:21,747 --> 00:39:25,649
I don't know anything.
-I'll kill you.

335
00:40:02,698 --> 00:40:04,968
(Second Arf')

336
00:40:46,546 --> 00:40:49,730
It's a miracle you're still alive...

337
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:53,897
But don't count on my help if you
keep looking for trouble.

338
00:40:56,138 --> 00:40:58,619
Give it here.

339
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,400
Don't you know everyone's
looking at you?

340
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:06,748
What are you doing here?

341
00:41:06,749 --> 00:41:10,812
His cigarette case.
He loved it so much.

342
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:15,612
I'll leave tomorrow and
this will all be over...

343
00:41:15,613 --> 00:41:17,601
Forever.
-Worried?

344
00:41:17,602 --> 00:41:22,790
No, just a strong desire to leave.
I'm not one of your kind.

345
00:41:23,091 --> 00:41:25,967
I don't have any right to anything.

346
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:30,862
I'm leaving.
(?)

347
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,780
Your happiness doesn't ring true.

348
00:41:33,781 --> 00:41:37,533
Do you like my clothes?
Anna lent them to me.

349
00:41:37,534 --> 00:41:39,568
Don't I look like her?

350
00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:43,653
(?) extraordinary

351
00:42:13,021 --> 00:42:17,787
There must be another fountain,
where you can't hear the water.

352
00:42:18,273 --> 00:42:21,594
Yes, come on.
Steve.

353
00:42:29,433 --> 00:42:31,693
Water, water.

354
00:42:31,794 --> 00:42:34,531
This place is very beautiful,
don't you think?

355
00:42:34,532 --> 00:42:37,401
A place to fall in love.

356
00:42:37,402 --> 00:42:39,945
But it's also a tomb, of course.

357
00:42:39,946 --> 00:42:42,611
Who knows if anyone has ever (?) in here?

358
00:42:42,612 --> 00:42:45,373
A dead fish.

359
00:42:51,836 --> 00:42:54,383
Your stick is dangerous.

360
00:42:54,384 --> 00:42:58,196
People like us must always think
defending ourselves.

361
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:02,630
Scared of fish?
I am sometimes, as well.

362
00:43:03,129 --> 00:43:07,195
And this helps me to be
a little less afraid.

363
00:43:07,396 --> 00:43:10,137
Where is the key?

364
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,302
I don't know.

365
00:43:14,503 --> 00:43:17,236
Klaus would have killed you...

366
00:43:17,237 --> 00:43:20,483
I was the one who stopped him.

367
00:43:20,484 --> 00:43:24,729
But you're working with the boss.
Where is the key?

368
00:43:25,057 --> 00:43:29,813
I'm sorry but I don't know.
I don't know.

369
00:44:01,037 --> 00:44:04,189
Why don't you ask Albert?

370
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,937
If I find out the boss doesn't
have the key...

371
00:44:06,938 --> 00:44:10,691
...and it suddenly appears,
we'll make a good couple.

372
00:44:12,728 --> 00:44:16,775
A good couple?
But I like to run.

373
00:46:09,992 --> 00:46:13,772
I don't know.
I don't know.

374
00:46:14,278 --> 00:46:16,615
I don't know.

375
00:47:36,957 --> 00:47:38,969
Jeanine.

376
00:48:33,033 --> 00:48:35,073
Klaus.

377
00:48:40,555 --> 00:48:42,994
Klaus.
-Come in.

378
00:48:43,318 --> 00:48:46,932
What do you want?
-To make a decision...

379
00:48:46,933 --> 00:48:49,422
We shouldn't take any more
risks than necessary...

380
00:48:49,423 --> 00:48:52,746
We'll get caught.
I don't feel safe here.

381
00:48:52,747 --> 00:48:57,423
Who is going to think of us?
They forgot about us for months.

382
00:48:57,424 --> 00:49:01,802
The people outside are having fun,
and soon we will too...

383
00:49:01,803 --> 00:49:04,319
You'll see.
-Yes, yes...

384
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:10,135
But in the meanwhile we're
risking a lot.

385
00:49:10,877 --> 00:49:12,953
Time is passing and nothing
is happening.

386
00:49:12,954 --> 00:49:15,492
What are you thinking?
We're all in a hurry.

387
00:49:15,493 --> 00:49:18,944
If we accept the boss' proposal...
-No.

388
00:49:19,245 --> 00:49:22,624
Why not?
Let's discuss it with the others.

389
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:27,208
Don't forget that the boss always
has some interesting business...

390
00:49:27,209 --> 00:49:30,858
And we'll give him half of
the diamonds...

391
00:49:30,859 --> 00:49:33,361
And he'll help us.
-No...

392
00:49:33,362 --> 00:49:36,909
The diamonds are here,
and they belong to us.

393
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:40,676
With everything we've
spent to get them...

394
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:43,396
Would you settle for half?

395
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,653
I just want it over with.

396
00:49:45,654 --> 00:49:48,230
The boss came here to tell
us he has the key...

397
00:49:48,231 --> 00:49:51,374
Fine.
He'll come tomorrow morning...

398
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:54,698
And he'll give it to us without
taking any of it.

399
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:58,838
And then we'll leave.
-Are you sure?

400
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:02,504
The boss knows what he wants.
-Me too.

401
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,764
What are you going to do?
Do you have to back to Tangiers?

402
00:50:08,765 --> 00:50:12,029
Why don't you come away with me?

403
00:50:12,717 --> 00:50:16,366
Let's see what happens
tomorrow morning...

404
00:50:16,367 --> 00:50:19,278
And then I'll decide.

405
00:51:08,603 --> 00:51:11,551
Is there are decision in the air?

406
00:51:15,089 --> 00:51:17,968
I was thinking about having
a chat about it.

407
00:51:17,969 --> 00:51:20,428
I'm listening.

408
00:51:22,018 --> 00:51:24,960
What do you want to do?

409
00:51:24,961 --> 00:51:29,117
Do what?
-With the boss?

410
00:51:29,514 --> 00:51:33,097
Tomorrow morning.
When he comes here.

411
00:51:33,098 --> 00:51:35,464
Kill him.

412
00:51:36,459 --> 00:51:39,094
Another dead body.

413
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:42,557
And what if the boss...

414
00:51:44,587 --> 00:51:47,338
...is only bluffing?

415
00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:49,773
Imbeciles...

416
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:53,320
Am I an imbecile as well?

417
00:51:53,321 --> 00:51:58,169
The boss isn't one to risk his own life.

418
00:51:58,758 --> 00:52:01,490
Imbeciles.

419
00:52:02,803 --> 00:52:05,514
What do you think about Steve?

420
00:52:08,377 --> 00:52:13,346
I don't like the way he does things,
I get the feeling he's hiding something.

421
00:52:15,705 --> 00:52:18,342
I don't know how to say it.

422
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:23,063
Despite that stick, he seems a lot
 more trite than he appears. (?)

423
00:52:23,064 --> 00:52:26,420
Boris didn't like him either.
-Right, Boris...

424
00:52:26,421 --> 00:52:29,970
I'm not convinced about
his death either.

425
00:52:29,971 --> 00:52:32,861
Sensations, sensations.
Let's finish this...

426
00:52:32,862 --> 00:52:35,970
Let's throw the boss a party,
we'll get that damned key...

427
00:52:35,971 --> 00:52:39,665
And we'll keep his fifty percent.
Boris is dead...

428
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:43,572
As for Steve,
he's just a two bit crook.

429
00:52:44,356 --> 00:52:48,229
We must act.
The time has come to do something.

430
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:51,798
I'll take care of everything
 tomorrow morning.

431
00:52:58,026 --> 00:53:02,530
I'll get you the key tomorrow morning,
you'll see.

432
00:53:45,294 --> 00:53:48,792
Aren't you going to ask
me why I'm here?

433
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:53,472
I'm not the curious type.

434
00:53:53,473 --> 00:53:58,205
And I'm always very discrete
with the ladies.

435
00:54:01,207 --> 00:54:04,179
But here...

436
00:54:05,252 --> 00:54:08,939
It's better to stay informed.

437
00:54:10,116 --> 00:54:12,612
So...

438
00:54:13,288 --> 00:54:16,770
Insomnia?
-No.

439
00:54:17,987 --> 00:54:21,817
Nervous?
-No.

440
00:54:25,372 --> 00:54:29,284
Then you're interested in my key?
-Not at all...

441
00:54:29,285 --> 00:54:32,461
I'm looking for an ally.

442
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:39,269
An ally?
Against who?

443
00:54:40,009 --> 00:54:43,237
Against Steve.

444
00:54:43,638 --> 00:54:46,423
Against?

445
00:54:47,137 --> 00:54:49,516
And why?

446
00:54:50,373 --> 00:54:53,084
It's dangerous.

447
00:54:53,085 --> 00:54:58,045
Jeanine is dead.
Steve killed her.

448
00:54:58,046 --> 00:55:00,098
No, listen to me...

449
00:55:00,099 --> 00:55:04,271
I figured out it was him and he knows.
He'll kill me as well.

450
00:55:04,587 --> 00:55:05,796
It was him...

451
00:55:05,797 --> 00:55:09,229
He found out Jeanine had hidden
the key in her hair clip...

452
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:14,190
And he killed her.
-Jeanine, the key...

453
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:17,657
How come you know all this?

454
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,278
I'm on guard, Juan.
I see everything.

455
00:55:22,279 --> 00:55:26,863
I saw Steve leave his room and
go into Jeanine's room.

456
00:55:26,864 --> 00:55:30,987
Then I spied on him.
It was horrible.

457
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:33,587
Poor thing.

458
00:55:36,677 --> 00:55:39,107
Poor thing?
Why?

459
00:55:39,108 --> 00:55:41,716
Deep down she was a fool.

460
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:44,977
As a woman and as the
boss' accomplice.

461
00:55:45,631 --> 00:55:49,265
He had her and the key in his grip.

462
00:55:49,266 --> 00:55:53,609
Now I understand why she begged
me to take her away from here.

463
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:57,717
Of course.
She had to deliver the key to the boss.

464
00:55:58,485 --> 00:56:01,971
So Steve has found the sixth key...

465
00:56:01,972 --> 00:56:07,512
And now you're scared.
Why didn't you tell Klaus?

466
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:12,943
Are you insane?
He'd kill us all.

467
00:56:15,313 --> 00:56:19,314
Or Carina?
-She's hysterical.

468
00:56:19,923 --> 00:56:23,051
I decided to trust you.

469
00:56:24,483 --> 00:56:29,569
You're one of those who find
solutions reasoning.

470
00:56:30,882 --> 00:56:34,821
Now, you and I know what happened...

471
00:56:39,543 --> 00:56:42,335
The diamonds.

472
00:56:43,022 --> 00:56:47,440
If you knew how many there are,
and what they look like....

473
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:52,350
It makes your head spin.

474
00:56:53,857 --> 00:56:58,273
It makes you go crazy just
thinking about it.

475
00:57:01,105 --> 00:57:05,831
Boris said there was a pair...
A pair...

476
00:57:05,832 --> 00:57:09,382
With an inestimable value.

477
00:57:09,383 --> 00:57:13,225
Inestimable value.

478
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:18,278
Do you want Steve to have it all?
Or Klaus?

479
00:57:18,579 --> 00:57:23,537
You must go to the garage.
The controls for the safe are in there...

480
00:57:23,538 --> 00:57:25,883
And wait for a while.

481
00:57:25,884 --> 00:57:28,634
We'll all come...

482
00:57:28,635 --> 00:57:31,961
Or Klaus will come.
Or me...

483
00:57:32,712 --> 00:57:37,515
Or Steve will come.
With me.

484
00:57:39,415 --> 00:57:43,510
Are you so sure?

485
00:57:46,016 --> 00:57:49,580
And what if they kill you first?

486
00:57:49,581 --> 00:57:52,283
No...

487
00:57:57,311 --> 00:58:00,833
My key is hidden there.

488
00:58:04,028 --> 00:58:07,610
They won't kill me.

489
00:58:08,563 --> 00:58:13,385
Not until I've accompanied
them to the safe at least.

490
00:58:21,423 --> 00:58:25,100
And you'll be waiting for us.

491
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:29,351
Juan, I trust you.

492
00:58:29,352 --> 00:58:34,715
I knew about Steve.

493
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:40,279
He's diabolical.
If only you'd seen him.

494
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:46,018
I'd really like it if you
arrived with him.

495
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:48,171
Come on...

496
00:58:48,172 --> 00:58:52,165
We won't argue to divide the diamonds.

497
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:57,347
We might also decide not to split them.

498
00:59:10,845 --> 00:59:16,506
The diamonds will keep us together.

499
00:59:19,217 --> 00:59:22,727
Remember, in situations like this...

500
00:59:22,728 --> 00:59:27,949
The smart ones are the ones
who come out on top.

501
00:59:29,175 --> 00:59:33,380
And we're the smart ones here.

502
00:59:54,045 --> 00:59:56,632
It was easy.

503
00:59:56,633 --> 00:59:59,863
You're infernal.

504
00:59:59,864 --> 01:00:04,346
But how much will this game cost us?

505
01:00:10,145 --> 01:00:14,200
A few people.
Well?

506
01:00:42,322 --> 01:00:44,676
Come.

507
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:51,038
Juan has left us as well.
And we have his key...

508
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:54,329
Whose idea was it to electrocute
the handles?

509
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:56,971
Boris?

510
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:01,759
And Jeanine?

511
01:02:02,065 --> 01:02:05,263
I'll go and have a look.

512
01:02:10,973 --> 01:02:12,718
Jeanine.

513
01:02:53,117 --> 01:02:56,571
She's asleep.
She's in a deep sleep...

514
01:02:56,572 --> 01:03:01,810
She has her head under her pillow,
I think she's taken a sleeping pill.

515
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:05,667
I'm going up.
Let me know...

516
01:03:05,668 --> 01:03:08,281
If anything happens.

517
01:03:38,854 --> 01:03:42,361
Steve, Jeanine is dead.
I'm scared, I'm going.

518
01:03:42,362 --> 01:03:45,292
There someone here who
 wants to kill us.

519
01:03:45,293 --> 01:03:48,655
And you have no idea who it could be?

520
01:03:49,866 --> 01:03:53,909
You must give me your key immediately.
-Then it's you.

521
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:57,299
I want your key.

522
01:04:00,514 --> 01:04:03,154
Let go of me.
-Give it to me.

523
01:04:03,155 --> 01:04:06,109
The key.
-Have mercy, Steve!

524
01:05:31,163 --> 01:05:33,645
Where are you, Steve?

525
01:05:33,646 --> 01:05:36,084
Are you hiding?

526
01:05:36,285 --> 01:05:39,391
Steve, where are you?
Answer me.

527
01:05:39,392 --> 01:05:43,259
Where are you?
-I'm here.

528
01:05:45,973 --> 01:05:50,109
In Boris' place.
I threw him in the bottom of the lake.

529
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:54,174
Come forward.
Or do you need your stick?

530
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:57,503
I don't need it anymore.

531
01:06:00,569 --> 01:06:02,761
I'll kill you.

532
01:06:02,762 --> 01:06:05,465
We have the same intentions, right?

533
01:06:05,466 --> 01:06:07,657
Yes.

534
01:06:08,262 --> 01:06:11,867
Where are you?
Come out.

535
01:06:15,426 --> 01:06:19,203
You killed all of them, yes?

536
01:06:19,815 --> 01:06:23,488
But where are you?
-I want the keys, Klaus...

537
01:06:23,489 --> 01:06:25,527
I want all of the diamonds.

538
01:06:25,528 --> 01:06:29,093
Then come and get them.

539
01:06:29,394 --> 01:06:32,719
Of course, I never leave 
things unfinished.

540
01:06:33,476 --> 01:06:39,199
And now what will you do?
You've wasted your six good chances.

541
01:06:39,925 --> 01:06:43,991
And you gave me the seventh.

542
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,231
Klaus.

543
01:07:19,177 --> 01:07:22,705
You were working with 
that dirty scumbag.

544
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:25,605
You damned whore.

545
01:07:25,606 --> 01:07:28,193
I was an idiot.
An idiot!

546
01:07:28,194 --> 01:07:31,131
Let go of me.
-You wanted to set me up.

547
01:07:31,132 --> 01:07:34,646
But your little princess act won't
 do you any good now...

548
01:07:34,647 --> 01:07:37,624
Understood?
-It wasn't me, it was Steve...

549
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:41,102
He wanted to kill them.
-Who do you think you are?

550
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,492
Anna.

551
01:08:06,493 --> 01:08:09,784
Have you calmed down?
Do we want to discuss it?

552
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:13,367
It was him I was waiting for, Steve.
Not you.

553
01:08:13,368 --> 01:08:15,888
He's been terrorising me since 
the day Boris died...

554
01:08:15,889 --> 01:08:19,006
He killed him,
just like Juan, Jeanine, Carina...

555
01:08:19,007 --> 01:08:22,315
All of them.
To keep the diamonds for himself.

556
01:08:22,316 --> 01:08:27,544
I've got nothing against you, Klaus.
That's why I didn't shoot.

557
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:31,842
You don't fool me.

558
01:08:31,843 --> 01:08:35,019
In that case I'll tell you that
 you must deal with me...

559
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:39,847
Whether you like or not.
-I just told you that you don't fool me.

560
01:08:40,195 --> 01:08:42,800
You must be crazy.

561
01:08:43,427 --> 01:08:46,068
I'm not crazy.

562
01:08:48,776 --> 01:08:51,817
The safe...

563
01:08:53,355 --> 01:08:57,110
...is locked behind an electric fence.

564
01:08:57,111 --> 01:09:00,668
And only I can disable it.

565
01:09:00,869 --> 01:09:04,302
Have you already forgotten Juan's face?

566
01:09:15,082 --> 01:09:18,093
But what are you frightened of?
I'm getting changed.

567
01:09:18,094 --> 01:09:21,803
We're going to the safe.
-And the keys?

568
01:09:21,804 --> 01:09:24,941
I have all of them now.
I took them from Steve.

569
01:09:24,942 --> 01:09:28,085
I only need your one.

570
01:09:28,086 --> 01:09:30,345
My one.

571
01:09:32,555 --> 01:09:35,239
So?
Are we going to stick together?

572
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,087
Or shall we split it?

573
01:09:38,088 --> 01:09:41,142
Let's go to the safe.

574
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:44,621
You want to talk about it after.
Okay.

575
01:09:46,025 --> 01:09:49,381
Now, if you don't mind...

576
01:09:49,382 --> 01:09:52,676
Get my car from the garage.

577
01:09:52,877 --> 01:09:56,440
To end up like Juan?

578
01:10:10,242 --> 01:10:12,665
Take it.

579
01:10:21,381 --> 01:10:25,131
Don't you understand it was
 him I was afraid of?

580
01:10:26,091 --> 01:10:28,807
Not you.

581
01:10:31,244 --> 01:10:37,076
I said let's go to the safe.
-And I told you to get the car.

582
01:10:42,642 --> 01:10:47,152
We'll need to get away from
here as soon as possible...

583
01:10:47,153 --> 01:10:50,308
You and me, Klaus.

584
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:54,333
Here's the key.

585
01:10:54,334 --> 01:10:57,524
Come on.
Go.

586
01:11:08,323 --> 01:11:11,669
I'll get ready then I'll join you.

587
01:11:12,168 --> 01:11:15,708
We'll go to the safe together.

588
01:11:18,813 --> 01:11:22,650
We've arrived at the last scene...

589
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:28,191
And only you and I remain
 to act it out.

590
01:11:28,192 --> 01:11:29,946
Go.

591
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:14,668
What is it?
-Hurry up.

592
01:12:15,438 --> 01:12:19,044
I'm about to start the engine.

593
01:12:21,216 --> 01:12:24,175
Okay.
I'm ready.

594
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:50,590
Anna, the door's closed.
Maybe it's a loose contact?

595
01:12:50,591 --> 01:12:54,678
Maybe.
Can you open it from outside?

596
01:12:54,679 --> 01:12:57,038
Come here.

597
01:12:59,617 --> 01:13:01,926
Yes.

598
01:13:02,866 --> 01:13:05,294
Klaus.
-Tell me.

599
01:13:05,295 --> 01:13:08,401
Don't you hear anything?
-What should I be hearing?

600
01:13:08,402 --> 01:13:11,239
Death.

601
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:26,245
I'll open that damned door.

602
01:19:07,361 --> 01:19:09,371
Here they are.

603
01:20:04,846 --> 01:20:07,908
And you?
-I'm leaving.

604
01:20:07,909 --> 01:20:10,952
Go ahead.
-One moment...

605
01:20:10,953 --> 01:20:14,838
Just one thing.
A request...

606
01:20:17,952 --> 01:20:21,396
To see them.
To touch them...

607
01:20:21,397 --> 01:20:25,780
I've heard so much about them.

608
01:21:49,878 --> 01:21:54,318
Fakes.
Very good ones...

609
01:21:54,319 --> 01:21:57,998
Very.
But fake.

610
01:21:57,999 --> 01:22:01,272
I suspected as much.

611
01:22:01,273 --> 01:22:07,557
There are two strong rooms in
the Amsterdam bank...

612
01:22:08,426 --> 01:22:12,892
One of them has the real ones,
and the other one...

613
01:22:19,162 --> 01:22:21,634
The fake ones.

614
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:27,835
Now I'll explain why the police
 didn't look too hard...

615
01:22:32,098 --> 01:22:34,978
They were fake.

616
01:22:34,979 --> 01:22:37,870
Fake diamonds.

617
01:22:39,566 --> 01:22:43,042
What a pity.

618
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,460
It happens.

619
01:22:54,190 --> 01:22:57,164
Farewell.

620
01:23:21,152 --> 01:23:24,510
Amateurs.

621
01:23:54,704 --> 01:23:57,496
I'm the boss.
I'm on my way...

622
01:23:57,497 --> 01:24:01,183
I always keep my promises.

623
01:24:01,742 --> 01:24:05,609
Are you ready?
I'm through with talking...

624
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:09,570
Understood?
I want half of the diamonds.

625
01:24:15,525 --> 01:24:17,825
Steve.

626
01:24:17,826 --> 01:24:19,856
Albert.

627
01:24:19,857 --> 01:24:22,409
Where are you?

628
01:24:22,844 --> 01:24:25,323
Klaus.

629
01:24:25,324 --> 01:24:27,365
Thomas.

630
01:24:27,366 --> 01:24:30,061
Boris.

631
01:24:32,405 --> 01:24:34,358
Albert.

632
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:38,360
Boris.

633
01:24:38,361 --> 01:24:40,258
Steve.

634
01:24:40,259 --> 01:24:42,109
Albert.

635
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:43,950
Klaus.

636
01:25:42,058 --> 01:25:45,420
You've finished.
Can we go?

637
01:25:59,667 --> 01:26:02,178
But these aren't mine,
they don't fit.

638
01:26:02,179 --> 01:26:04,598
Of course.
These ones are real...

639
01:26:04,599 --> 01:26:07,262
I broke yours.

640
01:26:07,263 --> 01:26:10,289
Real?

641
01:26:16,752 --> 01:26:20,308
Hello?
International insurance company?

642
01:26:20,309 --> 01:26:26,364
This is 'operation insurance policy'
 03140...

643
01:26:26,365 --> 01:26:29,848
The diamonds have been recovered.

644
01:26:29,849 --> 01:26:33,743
Did you encounter any difficulties?
-No danger...

645
01:26:33,744 --> 01:26:36,521
All I had to do was say 
they were fake.

646
01:26:36,522 --> 01:26:39,721
Okay, we're on our way.
-Fine...

647
01:26:39,722 --> 01:26:43,854
I'll stay with the diamonds
 until you arrive...

648
01:26:43,855 --> 01:26:49,635
Because there's a guy who is
demanding half of the loot.

649
01:26:49,936 --> 01:26:53,437
But I think he'll stay up there.

650
01:26:53,438 --> 01:26:56,193
You've done a great job.

651
01:26:56,194 --> 01:26:59,393
Thank you.

652
01:27:06,886 --> 01:27:09,386
Sorry...

653
01:27:09,387 --> 01:27:13,994
Give me the diamonds,
I'll go and put them back...

654
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:17,367
You wait here for me.

655
01:27:26,977 --> 01:27:31,623
Subtitled by the Eiffel Tower,
Paris, France...
