1
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:23,458
I told you from our first date

2
00:00:23,666 --> 00:00:25,958
not to bring anyone with you.

3
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:29,166
Instead you bring your brother,
your sister, your nephew,

4
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:33,416
we are never alone,
we are always in three!

5
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:37,500
You promised me:
"Tomorrow, who knows..."

6
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:42,458
"It'll be only me... with my mother!"

7
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:49,708
You, your mom, and I
walking around Toledo.

8
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,458
We walk ahead
and you mother walks behind us.

9
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,500
You, your mom, and I.

10
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:58,916
Always together.
It's crazy!

11
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,541
She even came on our honeymoon!

12
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,833
When we go to the movies or dancing,
and we try to make out

13
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,916
like a policeman
she's always there and stops us.

14
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:14,125
But I'm in love,

15
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:16,958
so I have given up on this.

16
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,500
I don't fight this anymore.

17
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:21,708
You, your mom, and I.

18
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,208
What consolation!
You, your mom, and I.

19
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:28,458
I'm done with this problem!
You, your mom, and I.

20
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,833
Saint Genaro gave me a miracle.

21
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,416
The other day
she couldn't get out of bed.

22
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:36,416
She had a fever,
it looked like she was dying.

23
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:40,791
I almost believed that
just the two of us would go out.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,458
Then I heard
your mother's little voice.

25
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:49,500
"The little girl will go with you."

26
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:57,000
Me, your sister and you
went to bar Chiatamone.

27
00:01:57,208 --> 00:02:01,166
"Do you want
an ice cream or a drink?"

28
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:03,500
Whatever costs more!

29
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,708
As a souvenir of that day,

30
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:09,750
at the Villa they took our picture.

31
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,791
She wanted a balloon, a sweet,
and she didn't want to walk!

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I looked at her and I thought
to throw her in the sea!

33
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:21,125
I gave up.

34
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,875
I am in love.

35
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,583
I don't fight it anymore.

36
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,958
My love,
you are always with your family.

37
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:33,333
Your family is more like a tribe.
They come from Milan, from the east.

38
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,958
And all these people
are always around!

39
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:41,000
An old aunt who lives in Cefalù

40
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:45,708
came here and she never left!

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,916
Me, your aunt and you.

42
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,833
Poor one, she is sickly,

43
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:56,333
every now and then she faints.

44
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,458
Me, your aunt and you.

45
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:01,041
Fresh eggs, mozzarella.

46
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,000
We only go around by carriage!

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I am paying for everything,
who is going to pay me back?

48
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:11,500
It's either I dump you now,
or next month I'll be broke.

49
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:18,333
You put me in troubles,
I should marry another one.

50
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,875
I don't wanna see you ever again.

51
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,250
You, you mom, and I.

52
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,958
Me, your father,
your brother, your sister.

53
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,291
- Freedom is here!
- No, Mrs. Amalia!

54
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,791
I'm getting free!

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You could never
find a mother like me!

56
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:41,375
Mrs. Amalia, you're not a mother,
you are two mothers,

57
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:45,166
two mother-in-law's,
all the mother-in-law's in the world!

58
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:50,041
Before you speak to me
rinse your mouth out with rosewater!

59
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,958
We nurtured a viper in our bosom.

60
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,458
You shut up!
You're not worthy of naming vipers!

61
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,458
They are holy animals of God.

62
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:02,708
You promised to take me
to the sanctuary in Pompeii!

63
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:07,833
Aunt Maria, walk to Pompeii,
like the pilgrims.

64
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:13,666
Nicolino, if you want to go, go,
but you will find me in the hospital!

65
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,833
- I will kill myself!
- Move it!

66
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:20,458
- I want to kill myself!
- Move it.

67
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,291
Nicolino left
and he's never coming back!

68
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,583
He's never coming back!

69
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:30,416
It's over.

70
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,083
It's over.

71
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,916
I am sorry for her.

72
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,125
What do I care?

73
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,958
I'll marry an orphan
and I'll do something good.

74
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,750
Above all else I'll have some peace.

75
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,500
Good evening.

76
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:06,083
- Hi, Gaetano.
- Nicolino, so you're not dead!

77
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:08,041
I haven't seen you in four shows!

78
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,875
Now you will see me more,
I broke up with the mother.

79
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,958
- With the mother?
- The mother, Carmelina...

80
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:21,041
In this country, to be
engaged is like being a slave.

81
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,958
Fortunately you understood this.
Now you are free and relaxed.

82
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,791
- Framing!
- Damn!

83
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:33,666
You can't relax for
one minute in this movie theater.

84
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,625
Nicolino, you did good.

85
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,666
Here, drink some wine.

86
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,875
What are you doing?

87
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,958
Don Gaetano, what are you doing?
Sleeping?

88
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,166
- What?
- It's still the first part.

89
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:51,708
- And so?
- We've already seen this!

90
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,208
You'll understand the story better.

91
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:57,333
You are ignorant,
you need to see things twice!

92
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:01,916
- What now?
- Wait for the end of the movie. Go.

93
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,291
Nicolino, what are you thinking?

94
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,041
Without Carmelina,
I'm better off dead.

95
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,541
What did the bus driver
ever do to you?

96
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,500
If you want to ruin yourself,
marry her.

97
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,708
Easy for you to say!

98
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,916
Her mother told me:
"Carmelina is still a little girl".

99
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,916
"Only after three years can
you know each other well enough."

100
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,208
Not even a marriage last three years!

101
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,000
And she says
I don't have a steady job.

102
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,708
Does she know
that you run this movie theater?

103
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:41,125
She hates movie theaters,
she prefers TV.

104
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,708
How disgusting!

105
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:46,000
- Who does she want for her girl?
- I know!

106
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:48,666
Giosuè ruined me.

107
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,958
Giosuè had arms
as big as roller coasters!

108
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:57,250
I don't like them,
they make me sick.

109
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:01,083
You have to marry a strong man,
a sailor like your dad.

110
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:03,916
Nicolino is strong,
he's stronger than dad

111
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,208
and he doesn't have any ugly tattoos.

112
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:10,833
Ungrateful. How dare you
offend your dad's tattoos?

113
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,708
She's killing me.

114
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:16,500
Instead of arguing come
to the table. It's getting cold!

115
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:19,958
- I'll still eat it.
- Amalia, let her be.

116
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,916
Carmelina didn't want to offend him.

117
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:27,500
Annunziata, you know what
the rose tattoo means to me.

118
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,166
You told me many times!

119
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,791
- You are the rose.
- He got the tattoo

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,083
so I could always be with him.

121
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,666
They don't make men
like that anymore!

122
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,833
They all died with him
in that shipwreck.

123
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,041
May they rest in peace.
Some more.

124
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,041
- Yes.
- Today these poor girls

125
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,125
have to sacrifice with
these scrawny men that are left.

126
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,500
Nicolino is one of the good ones.

127
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:56,750
I don't want to end up
like an old hag like aunt Maria!

128
00:07:56,958 --> 00:08:00,208
You'd wish to end up like me.
I'm a respectable woman.

129
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,458
I never got married
because I always hated men.

130
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,375
Mom says that you were born a hag.

131
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:08,833
- Did you say that?
- It's not true!

132
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,250
It's too much! It's too much!

133
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,250
- Maria...
- I'm leaving.

134
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,458
- Why?
- I'm going back to Benevento.

135
00:08:17,916 --> 00:08:21,458
Maria, what are you doing?
You know that we love you!

136
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,708
Ugly gossiper!

137
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,333
Now that we got that all out,
we are finished eating.

138
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,791
Carmelina, I helped your mother
bring you into this world.

139
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I want to help you stay in it.

140
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,916
Eat a chicken leg. It's so good!

141
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:48,958
Without Nicolino,
chicken just isn't chicken.

142
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:55,208
Even the house, the furniture.

143
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,458
I even bought the curtains.

144
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,583
The chandelier
Carmelina really liked.

145
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,208
How horrible! I don't like it.

146
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:10,375
Love makes you do weird things!

147
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:15,500
Everything in the house was all
that a married couple could ask for.

148
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:19,541
There was everything,
only she was missing.

149
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,291
No, an ashtray was missing!
Everything was missing.

150
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,916
Why do I care?
Let's burn this cursed house down!

151
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,666
Who's bothering me?

152
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,083
- Nicolino!
- What are you doing?

153
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,041
I came to stay here.
I don't want you to be alone.

154
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,125
- I'll sacrifice and live with you.
- You can't.

155
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:53,083
- Carmelina will live here.
- You two got into an argument!

156
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:56,166
- Yes, but...
- Where will we sleep?

157
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,916
There's only one bed.

158
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,666
- We'll figure it out!
- Gaetano...

159
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:05,916
Listen. If you want to stay here,
you can sleep in the living room.

160
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:12,583
- You can't sleep in the bed.
- The wool will get ruined.

161
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:16,000
What do I care? I'm ruined,
it will be the same for the wool!

162
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,125
Gaetano, I am suffering a lot!

163
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,541
Nicolino, you suffer because
you want to suffer.

164
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,791
If I was her fiancé,
this wool would be fine!

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,375
Gaetano, go away!

166
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,875
Carmelina is a serious girl.

167
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:38,625
Do you remember the movie
we showed last week?

168
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,708
And so?

169
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,500
There were two lovers
that wanted to get married

170
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:46,583
but the parents didn't
want them to. And...

171
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:52,416
The parents were forced to let them
get married. Understand?

172
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:57,166
- They were forced.
- She's not that kind of girl.

173
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,916
I don't care if it's true or not,
but we should make a threat.

174
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:03,750
All you have to say is:

175
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:07,666
"Let us marry now, or we'll have
a wedding and baptism together."

176
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:12,000
But now I don't have the courage
to go near that house.

177
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:16,208
If you don't submit to her mother,
then it's better that you forget her.

178
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,875
"Every good thing
comes with a bad side".

179
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:22,625
Says the guy who's mother-in-law died
then he had to pay for her funeral.

180
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:28,333
Mom, I don't want to eat. I want
to die of hunger like Count Ugolino.

181
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:30,250
You don't want to eat?

182
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:34,041
Aunt Maria invited us over
so that we could make up!

183
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,125
Do it for me, Carmelina.

184
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,916
It was very difficult for me
to come here with you.

185
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:42,208
I'm still not going to eat. I want
to end up like Count Ugolino!

186
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:46,291
Who is he?
Do you know something about him?

187
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,750
I don't know him. The Aristocrats
are going through a tough time.

188
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,041
- Mom, I'll eat.
- I don't care if you eat.

189
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,666
Careful, you'll end up in the sea!

190
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,916
Let's start eating.

191
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:03,083
You're going to act like this
over that silly man!

192
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:08,458
Are we ever going to eat?
I'm going to start eating.

193
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,666
- Something to eat?
- Of course.

194
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:13,333
- Fish soup.
- I'll take spaghetti and clams.

195
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:17,166
- Good. Miss?
- Spaghetti and fish soup.

196
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,666
- I'll bring them out together?
- Together.

197
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,958
- Do you have lasagne?
- Of course.

198
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,833
Two spaghetti with clams,
two fish soup and one lasagne.

199
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,666
There's lasagne!

200
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,125
I want to cancel one spaghetti
and I'll take the lasagne.

201
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,708
I want lasagne as well,
cancel one soup.

202
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:39,125
- I will cancel one fish soup.
- No, don't.

203
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,875
I'll take her fish soup
instead of the lasagne.

204
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:44,958
If Carmelina doesn't want to eat,
too bad for her.

205
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:48,416
Carmelina wants to eat.
She's going to eat!

206
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,375
She's hungry, food is coming.

207
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,125
- That's all that was needed!
- Nicolino!

208
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,041
Come here.
What are you doing here?

209
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,875
Do you want to argue in public?

210
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:05,250
I came here to apologize to you.

211
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,500
You have some nerve!

212
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,666
I know I was wrong,
but I want to make it right.

213
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:14,166
- I am your humble son.
- What son are you talking about?

214
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:17,000
You are not part of my family.

215
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:21,208
Remember that
Carmelina has to eat.

216
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,375
I can't live without you all,
I love you.

217
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,791
Me? He's totally crazy!

218
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,291
- Do you love me?
- Yes.

219
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,833
You, Sisinella, Aunt Maria.
I love you all!

220
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,083
I'm so used to being with you all.

221
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,708
Yesterday I was walking by myself
and I felt like I was naked!

222
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:44,958
Let him kiss your hand and we
won't worry about it ever again.

223
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:50,291
OK, I want to be good,
blood isn't water.

224
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,958
- I don't want my daughter to die.
- Good job!

225
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,625
- Let's go.
- Let's go eat.

226
00:13:56,291 --> 00:14:00,708
What's this?
Hands to yourself. Let's go.!

227
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,333
Let's go. Let's sit there.

228
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:07,250
Finally we can eat.
I've been looking forward to it!

229
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,500
Not there. Aunt Maria at the
head of the table, you sit there.

230
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,166
The ladies already ordered.
What would you like?

231
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,833
- Tortellini with meat sauce.
- Tortellini...

232
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,458
I'll also take the tortellini.

233
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,750
Also for me the tortellini.

234
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,916
- I would like ice cream.
- Ok, after we will get ice cream.

235
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:27,750
Hold on, calm down, ladies!

236
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:31,750
Speak one at a time,
or I can't understand anything.

237
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,875
You asked for three fish soups

238
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,583
but now you want three tortellini.

239
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:39,833
One spaghetti and one lasagne.

240
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:44,291
We have few minutes.
Listen to what I'm about to say.

241
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,375
- You're about to have a child.
- What are you saying?

242
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,958
- Are you ok?
- Yes.

243
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,458
Did you understand
what we ordered?

244
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,750
Yes. Three tortellini,
two lasagne and one fish soup.

245
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:00,500
For the young lady...
Where is the young lady?

246
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:04,458
Carmelina, order something to eat!

247
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:08,416
- Scrambled eggs.
- This is all scrambled!

248
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:11,833
I want scrambled eggs,
and also tortellini and fish soup.

249
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,875
I'd take that as well,
but my liver hurts!

250
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:18,041
- Who ordered liver?
- You didn't understand anything!

251
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,625
No one ordered the liver.

252
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,958
You do what I say.
They will have to submit.

253
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,583
You're going to get me in trouble!

254
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,583
You have to do it for
our love, for our happiness.

255
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,458
I wrote down what I wanted to tell you.

256
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,625
This is the fruit...

257
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,625
The fruit in this hand...

258
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:44,125
Here in the womb of your daughter
is the fruit of her love.

259
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,166
I knew it!

260
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,875
Mom, in the womb of your daughter

261
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,250
is the fruit of her love!

262
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,208
The sweet fruit of a sour love.

263
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,375
Why is it sour?

264
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,833
Hey! What are you doing?

265
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,250
That's bad manners.

266
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,916
Carmelina is talking to herself,
she's saying she has a fruit.

267
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,458
What fruit?

268
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,916
She must've eaten it,
she says it's sweet.

269
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,875
Sweet?

270
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,541
For a moment of happiness.

271
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,208
How much I suffer!

272
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,583
How much... No!

273
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:30,666
How much does one have to pay
for a moment of happiness!

274
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:35,000
What a scandal! Amalia, my sister.

275
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,458
- Be strong, be calm.
- What happened?

276
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,666
Carmelina has a fruit in her womb.

277
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,333
- What fruit?
- The sweet one that was sour.

278
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,291
- Is this a joke?
- What is a womb?

279
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,958
Carmelina has a stomach ache?

280
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:54,083
- It's not a stomach ache! I wish.
- What is it?

281
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:57,291
- You have to stay calm.
- I am really calm.

282
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,375
- What are you talking about?
- Try to understand.

283
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:04,458
I am not married, certain things
are a sin just to think about!

284
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:08,416
Mom, Carmelina ate
the fruit that Nicolino gave her.

285
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,541
Be quiet, gossiper!
You should mind your own business.

286
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,583
And I don't.
Carmelina ate the fruit!

287
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,458
There, in the womb of your daughter,
is the fruit of her love.

288
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:24,500
The sweet fruit of a sour love.
What suffering!

289
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:29,875
How much does one has
to pay for a moment of happiness.

290
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:34,791
Suffering! The price is too
high for a moment of love.

291
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,333
Wretched soul! What are you saying?

292
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,791
- Nothing. I'm not saying anything.
- Nothing?

293
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,750
Aren't you embarrassed to
say these things at your age?

294
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:47,916
- What is this silliness?
- It's not silliness.

295
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,166
- Then what is it?
- The truth.

296
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:55,708
The truth? You are still
a little girl! It's not possible.

297
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm not a little girl anymore,
I'm a woman.

298
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:03,791
- Wait, now I'm even a mother.
- Virgin Mary!

299
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,166
What are you saying?

300
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:11,041
Who is the fruit vendor?

301
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,291
Mom, I only know one man.
My Nicolino!

302
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,708
Nicolino! Again Nicolino
in front of my eyes!

303
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,708
My God,
I can't deal with this anymore...

304
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,916
Amalia!

305
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,083
Amalia, Amalia!

306
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,166
- Hi, Sisinella.
- Come in, come in.

307
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,416
- Talk to mom!
- Why?

308
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:36,000
You gave fruit to Carmelina
and now she has a stomach ache.

309
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:40,125
- What?
- I know everything. Mom even fainted!

310
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:44,333
- So Carmelina has decided!
- Don't touch me.

311
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,041
Mom, wake up.
I'll tell you the truth.

312
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,250
Mom! Mom!

313
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,916
- Amalia!
- Mom, wake up.

314
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,125
- Oh God!
- See what happened?

315
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,125
- Hurry up, give me a kiss.
- Nicolino, are you crazy?

316
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,791
- Have some respect for my mother.
- Give me a kiss!

317
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,833
Mom, wake up!

318
00:19:06,041 --> 00:19:09,166
Nicolino is trying to kiss Amalia.

319
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,541
- Where is he?
- Here I am. At your service.

320
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,916
Disgraceful, rascal, idiot!

321
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:21,000
You ruined my daughter,
our home, our family. Everything!

322
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:25,708
Stay calm. I'm not running away,
I'll take my responsibility.

323
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,625
Do you have the guts to talk?

324
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,541
- I want to fix everything.
- What do you want to fix?

325
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,208
The trouble is already done.

326
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,166
She deserves an honorable man
for her child.

327
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:40,500
- Where can I find one?
- I am a honorable man!

328
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:44,416
- I'll marry her, if you want.
- If I want?

329
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:48,041
You should be a bit more humble
after all the problems you caused?

330
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,875
Of course you have to marry her!

331
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:53,583
But I want to know something.

332
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,916
I never lost track of you.

333
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,625
I always had somebody watching you.

334
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,625
Explain to me how you did it?

335
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,458
It's not the time.
Carmelina would get ashamed!

336
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:08,750
- You'd get ashamed, right?
- Yes, I'm ashamed... About?

337
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:12,833
You should've been ashamed before!
Now it's too late!

338
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,583
Exactly... Too late. Very late.

339
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:19,250
We are wasting time
with all this chatter.

340
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,250
Nicolino is right,
the months go by fast.

341
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,791
- They fly!
- When did this happen?

342
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,666
I don't know!
Nicolino knows, he did it all!

343
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,791
What is this?

344
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,416
I want to see through this.
Come to Annunziata with me.

345
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:39,666
So we can figure out the truth.

346
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:53,583
Hurry up, Annunziata.
The baby will be born by itself!

347
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:56,041
- The hat.
- I don't have the hat!

348
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,416
- Mine!
- You need it to help give birth?

349
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,583
- I am a lady!
- I'm worried!

350
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,000
Calm down, we have time.

351
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,500
Get out. Leave!

352
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,833
My wife can't wait!

353
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,041
I have to speak with you.

354
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,458
You don't have to talk
to anyone, I am first.

355
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:20,458
Wait outside, I'll be right there.

356
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:23,458
- My child will be born by itself!
- Get out.

357
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,875
Nicolino, wait.
When I come back we can talk.

358
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,708
I can't wait.
Amalia and Carmelina are arriving.

359
00:21:29,916 --> 00:21:33,125
- If they find me here, I am done!
- They're coming here?

360
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,375
What are they coming to do here?

361
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,625
Between you and Carmelina...

362
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:42,000
It's not what you think.
I need your help.

363
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:47,250
How dare you?
I am an honest midwife!

364
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:51,375
- I don't do certain things!
- Relax. What did you understand?

365
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:54,000
You need
to help me marry Carmelina.

366
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,750
You know the situation I'm in.

367
00:21:56,958 --> 00:22:00,916
- I resolved to a trick.
- What did you do?

368
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:04,458
Me and Carmelina told that
we are expecting, but it's not true.

369
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm about to climb
Mount Calvary for you.

370
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:12,541
- I'm climbing it.
- Mrs., don't go up!

371
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,333
- Why not?
- Annunziata isn't here.

372
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:19,541
- Did she leave?
- No, she didn't leave.

373
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:24,833
She is not here,
but she didn't leave yet?

374
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:28,958
- Move it, Carmelina.
- OK, go.

375
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,208
Whatever happens happens.

376
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,666
It's destiny,
he will be born by itself.

377
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:38,708
- What do you want from me?
- Say that Carmelina is pregnant.

378
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:42,541
- So we can get married.
- If she discovers everything,

379
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,916
- how will I look?
- Don't worry.

380
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:47,541
I'll fix that right away!

381
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,250
Now we have to go.
Let's go.

382
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,916
They're here! Go over there.

383
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,875
Amalia, how are you?
How nice to see you again!

384
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,541
Every day these kids are a problem.

385
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,375
- What happened?
- You need to check out the girl.

386
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:10,666
- What are you saying?
- Nothing happened!

387
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:15,250
- It's better if I leave.
- Carmelina, come here.

388
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:19,416
Sit here and tell me what happened.

389
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:22,791
Open your mouth,
stick out your tongue.

390
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:26,291
- This girl is pregnant!
- Me?

391
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,708
- It's very clear!
- How? Just by looking?

392
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:33,458
You can see with the naked eye!
The baby is in there.

393
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:37,750
- I think it's a boy.
- It can't be true!

394
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,125
Do you know more than Annunziata?

395
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:43,458
Nicolino and I,
we haven't been alone together.

396
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,208
Then it's someone else?
Who was it?

397
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:49,500
- No one. How did it happened.
- Oh, Virgin Mary!

398
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,875
Calm down, Amalia.

399
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:55,708
Ready? For what? Without me?

400
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:59,416
I knew it! I'll take care of it.
Congratulations, goodbye.

401
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:02,041
Excuse me, I must tell the
poor guy who's waiting.

402
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,125
- Who is it?
- The father.

403
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:07,750
The father! It's not Nicolino?

404
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:10,708
Wait! Where are you going?

405
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,958
Carmelina! Come here.

406
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,125
- Come here!
- Nicolino, I'm afraid!

407
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,791
- What are you doing?
- Mrs. Annunziata is in on it.

408
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,666
- You keep playing your part.
- I didn't know anything!

409
00:24:21,875 --> 00:24:24,375
- I got scared.
- It went fine.

410
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,583
You're the father.

411
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:30,541
- It was you!
- What are you doing?

412
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:37,041
- What father?
- One moment!

413
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,708
- This is the other father.
- What are you talking about?

414
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:44,708
Please, relax, calm!
It's a beautiful girl.

415
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,958
That one? She was going to eat me!

416
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:50,333
No! Not her! You are a father,
I just found out.

417
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:53,666
You were all in on it!

418
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:56,041
Stay calm, I am the father.

419
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,833
Nicolino, you're here!
So who is this man?

420
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:00,875
He was having a child.

421
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:04,875
- OK, but the real father is me.
- Yes, the real father is him.

422
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:08,208
What did you say? Repeat it!

423
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:11,958
- I'll kill you!
- Stop!

424
00:25:12,166 --> 00:25:14,708
How disgusting!
Let's review the situation.

425
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:16,916
You are the father of your child.

426
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:21,625
- He is the father of another child!
- Good!

427
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:24,500
My daughter has only one father
and that father is me!

428
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:26,666
- Let's hope!
- No, it's me.

429
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:29,041
Go to your daughter.

430
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,166
Let them get married right away.

431
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:35,125
- Hurry up.
- Get married right away.

432
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,458
Come back to me
when it's the right time.

433
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:41,083
- Do you understand?
- Of course.

434
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:43,916
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

435
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:49,750
Relax, Nicolino.
These are the last sacrifices.

436
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,791
It's humiliating

437
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,041
but Maria is going to take care
of the documents for our marriage.

438
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:06,041
- Send us the documents right away!
- Don't worry.

439
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,083
- I'll hurry up.
- May the Lord guide you.

440
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:12,625
Every day that goes by,
the problem gets bigger!

441
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,416
Here, it's done.

442
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:18,666
Aunt Maria, your bags are loaded.
You can leave!

443
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:22,750
- You're even being funny!
- Should I start crying?

444
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:26,083
Amalia, don't get upset,
he is an unresponsive man!

445
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:30,875
Worry about the documents.
Send them right away.

446
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:34,125
Carmelina's honor is in your hands!

447
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:36,958
Mom, do you want to tell everyone?

448
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:39,875
I'm not like you and Nicolino!

449
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,833
This story has made me tired.
I feel nauseous!

450
00:26:43,041 --> 00:26:46,000
- Nicolino, you are going to vomit!
- What do you want?

451
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:48,083
Don't worry, I'm not sick.

452
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:51,041
I have two children,
I'm more of an expert than you.

453
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,000
In your condition,
you should have nausea.

454
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:56,750
Leave me alone.

455
00:26:57,875 --> 00:27:01,083
If mom says you have nausea,
you have nausea.

456
00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:04,416
- Really?
- Yes. Mom is always right.

457
00:27:11,541 --> 00:27:13,958
Don't worry, this will help you.

458
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:18,250
- Mom, I feel something here.
- What is it?

459
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:21,708
- I am craving strawberries.
- Strawberries?

460
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:23,625
Wait a second.

461
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,875
Yes, strawberries.

462
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:31,625
- I'll send someone to get them.
- Mom, they are expensive!

463
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:35,583
I don't care. Nicolino has to
learn what it means to be a father!

464
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:42,000
Go buy half a kilo of strawberries,
Carmelina is craving them.

465
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,750
- Strawberries?
- Are you sure?

466
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:48,708
- Yes, strawberries!
- Not oranges or clementines?

467
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:51,666
No. Go. It can't be born
craving strawberries!

468
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:55,625
I'm going to get strawberries
for Carmelina.

469
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,708
Good boy.

470
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:03,458
- Nicolino, good morning.
- Good morning!

471
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:06,125
I'm going, Carmelina
is craving strawberries.

472
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:08,708
She has a craving,
also Mrs. Amalia told me.

473
00:28:08,916 --> 00:28:11,208
The baby is due in spring, right?

474
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:16,750
What? Many springs may come
but nothing will come out!

475
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:22,333
What?
You still haven't fixed that problem?

476
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:25,375
Carmelina is a well respected girl!

477
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:29,083
And so am I!

478
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:33,375
What should I tell Amalia?
You promised me...

479
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:36,000
Do you want to get me arrested?

480
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:40,666
If only! You came to me,
I am an honest professional.

481
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:45,375
You asked for my help,
but you don't want to collaborate!

482
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:49,833
- I did everything!
- Nicolino, enough.

483
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:52,875
If Amalia calls me,
I will tell her the truth.

484
00:28:53,083 --> 00:28:54,416
- No!
- Yes.

485
00:28:54,625 --> 00:28:57,500
Wait a little bit longer,
at least a few more days.

486
00:28:57,708 --> 00:29:02,083
Shut up! Go away. How terrible
are the young generations!

487
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:06,125
To have a child,
they need some help!

488
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:10,916
Mailman, is there mail
for the Gerace family?

489
00:29:12,166 --> 00:29:15,375
- Yes, a registered letter.
- Where should I sign?

490
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:20,916
Thank you. Annunziata!

491
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:25,500
Annunziata, the documents
have arrived! Carmelina!

492
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:29,291
- You have to eat.
- Carmelina!

493
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,916
- Here are the strawberries!
- Slowly, slowly.

494
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:35,458
The baby might suffer. Calm down.

495
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:39,875
- The strawberries?
- The documents have arrived!

496
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:44,541
- Let me see them. They are them!
- Wonderful!

497
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,875
- We are ready.
- Finally!

498
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:51,541
Now we can get married.

499
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,166
Oh God! Oh God, no.

500
00:29:57,375 --> 00:30:00,416
- It's not possible!
- What happened?

501
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:04,791
It's not possible, my daughter.
Something terrible!

502
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,750
- My child, be strong.
- Mom, you're scaring me!

503
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:13,583
- What happened?
- Poor child!

504
00:30:14,916 --> 00:30:17,375
What a mess! Now what can we do?

505
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:21,125
- The documents have arrived?
- If only you knew...

506
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:24,166
What?

507
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:27,375
Would you like to tell me?

508
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:30,166
Here it says you're a man.

509
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:33,708
Carmelo Gerace born in Benevento.

510
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,750
- Is it you or not?
- Of course it's her!

511
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:40,041
She's not a man, she's a woman!

512
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:45,791
Nicolino, I am a woman, I swear.
I am a woman.

513
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,916
How could you become
a father if she was a man?

514
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:55,750
These days you never know.
Times have certainly changed.

515
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:59,375
- It could happen, right?
- Don't say nonsense!

516
00:30:59,583 --> 00:31:02,791
What you are talking about
happens only in the news.

517
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,708
She's a man only according
to her birth certificate.

518
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:08,625
Amalia, remember
how they made this mistake?

519
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:13,333
- Your husband wanted a boy.
- Yes! It's true.

520
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:16,666
Giosuè, it was you!

521
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,041
Your father, the day you were born,

522
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:24,708
was so sure you were a boy
that he registered you as Carmelo.

523
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:28,708
I was sure he made
the correction after her birth.

524
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:33,375
Good soul,
he had his head in the clouds!

525
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:36,458
Nicolino, go open the door.

526
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:40,833
I have to be a man
for the rest of my life?

527
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:43,541
No we just have
to make a small correction.

528
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,208
At City Hall with two witnesses.

529
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:51,291
Does Carmelo Gerace live here?

530
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,833
Not exactly. Well, maybe.
What is this about?

531
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,333
- Military service.
- What?

532
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,708
You understood well.
By law, if he doesn't show up,

533
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:04,458
he will be considered
a deserter. Good day.

534
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:12,500
- Who?
- I have a military wife!

535
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:17,875
- No!
- What happened?

536
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:22,000
My child, you are being called
to military service!

537
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:25,416
- They will reform you.
- Why are you crying?

538
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:28,750
It's me who should be crying!
First the mother, then the aunt,

539
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:32,125
then the sister and now the country!

540
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:51,291
- Who do you want?
- Me... Her...

541
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,708
- Us...
- I understand, you are the cadet.

542
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:56,708
Go to the nurse.

543
00:32:56,916 --> 00:33:00,208
I wish, but it's not for me,
it's for my girlfriend.

544
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:05,333
- Young man, don't waste my time.
- Carmelina, let's go.

545
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:08,333
Miss, women can't enter here!

546
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:12,208
- My daughter is not a woman.
- Why is she dressed like a woman?

547
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:15,208
She's dressed like a woman,
but she's not a woman.

548
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:18,375
She is a woman, madam.
Women aren't allowed here.

549
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:21,500
I was ordered here.
And so I'll go as a woman.

550
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:26,166
- Let her come in as a woman!
- What is this all about?

551
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:29,500
- I don't have time to waste.
- Just let us go.

552
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:34,041
- My girlfriend is a woman.
- She even has a child!

553
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:37,708
- That has to do military service?
- No! She has to!

554
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:41,333
- They declared her deserter.
- It's not her fault.

555
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,333
She didn't know she was a man.

556
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:46,291
He is a man and doesn't have
to do military service.

557
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,458
She is a woman and she has to do
military service. And you?

558
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:52,458
- I have to go in!
- You are crazy!

559
00:33:53,916 --> 00:33:56,291
- That's absurd!
- Yes, that's absurd.

560
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
It's useless to have
a medical check up.

561
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:03,250
- The girl is not a man!
- Of course... It appears so.

562
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,833
She is a girl.

563
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:09,083
Unfortunately,
here it's written Carmelo Gerace.

564
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:11,291
And he must pass a physical.

565
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,791
It may be a scam.

566
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,708
- These are real! Look.
- Mom, calm down.

567
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:24,250
I'm not giving the physical,
the doctor has to.

568
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:28,000
- Cadet Gerace, follow me.
- OK.

569
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,958
- Carmelina!
- Calm down.

570
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:32,791
We have nothing to fear.

571
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,041
I won't let that Carmelina
take a physical like a man.

572
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,500
- I don't want her to be a soldier!
- Nonsense!

573
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:43,208
Carmelina!

574
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:45,625
- Where is Carmelina?
- Where is my daughter?

575
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:49,250
- Stay calm.
- I'm not leaving her here!

576
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:54,041
Guys!

577
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,125
Behave! Silence.

578
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,666
May I? Please, miss.

579
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,208
Go away!

580
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,083
Wait one moment.

581
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,958
- More to the right.
- May I, Major sir?

582
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,791
I don't want to be disturbed.

583
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,458
Excuse me, but it's important.

584
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:28,333
One moment.
Do you feel pain in your shoulder.

585
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:32,541
Deep breath.

586
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,791
- You can't breathe deeper?
- More than that no.

587
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,625
- Should I make her wait?
- Yes.

588
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,791
Don't bother me!

589
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:48,041
Wait here. When the Major has
finished, we will resolve everything.

590
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,041
Ok, I'll wait here.

591
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,208
What are you doing? Go away!

592
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:57,666
Enter.

593
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:02,125
Get undressed.

594
00:36:03,166 --> 00:36:05,541
Do you understand? Naked.

595
00:36:13,791 --> 00:36:15,375
Breathe!

596
00:36:20,916 --> 00:36:23,333
OK! Good job.

597
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:32,208
Now, hold your breath.

598
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:36,708
It's too much!

599
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,125
What's happening?

600
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:59,875
It's a very strange case!

601
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,375
No, it's a striptease.

602
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:06,416
What are you doing here?

603
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:10,750
I was called to service,
now I must pass a physical.

604
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:13,291
- What?
- Should I take off my stockings?

605
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,250
Don't say nonsense and get dressed.

606
00:37:20,666 --> 00:37:23,375
Where did
that poor daughter of mine went?

607
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:26,958
- You can't get in!
- Did a girl went here?

608
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:29,958
- She is there.
- Where?

609
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,958
What do you want?

610
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,541
Let me in, I must get in!

611
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:43,166
- Are they crazy?
- Shameless!

612
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:46,375
- You are shameless! What did you do?
- Who are you? Out!

613
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:51,375
I am the mother. Now tell me
what you did to my daughter!

614
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:56,791
Aren't you ashamed of being naked
in front of ladies?

615
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,375
How dare you?
I'm in charge here!

616
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:02,291
If I was in charge,
such things wouldn't happen!

617
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,916
- How dare you?
- Nicolino!

618
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:09,291
- Where did you come out?
- Carmelina, what did they do to you?

619
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,375
Nicolino, they ruined you!

620
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:15,416
Good job, now I have to see this too.

621
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:18,875
What is this display of affection?

622
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:22,291
What does this mean?

623
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,666
Why are you here?
What do you want?

624
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:28,708
I don't want to be a soldier!

625
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:32,541
I just want to marry my Nicolino.

626
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:35,125
Please, don't raise your voice.

627
00:38:35,333 --> 00:38:37,833
It may be dangerous for the baby.

628
00:38:38,041 --> 00:38:40,208
The baby? Where?

629
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:43,416
It's on his way.

630
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:48,041
Check, so you can
discharge my daughter.

631
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,250
What nonsense
are you talking about?

632
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:53,458
Isn't this a good reason
to discharge her?

633
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:56,125
Have you ever had
a pregnant soldier before?

634
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:59,833
- Mom, we can't tell lies to him.
- What?

635
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:03,583
It was Nicolino's
idea to get married.

636
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:05,375
What?

637
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:08,708
- What are you saying? Are you crazy?
- I'm not pregnant!

638
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:11,708
- I never was!
- What?

639
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:15,750
- So you lied to me.
- Mom, she's lying.

640
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:19,875
We must say the truth, if they find
out that we have been lying...

641
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:23,833
- What lies!
- We could get arrested!

642
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:27,458
- What is this story?
- I will tell you.

643
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,666
Now everything is clear.

644
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:33,458
It's the story of a wretched bastard,

645
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:37,500
rascal and a liar. Do you understand?

646
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,833
Nothing happened between us.

647
00:39:41,041 --> 00:39:43,250
And do you even brag about it?

648
00:39:43,458 --> 00:39:45,541
I thought I had
a dishonored daughter.

649
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:49,875
While you were making fun
of a mother. You disappointed me.

650
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,708
- Forgive us.
- Shut up.

651
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:56,916
- I can't forgive you.
- Help!

652
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:58,958
Enough!

653
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:13,916
The first love is unforgettable.

654
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,541
Do you want to bet
that I will forget her?

655
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,833
I can't live like that!

656
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:26,125
If I think about you,
I think about your mother too.

657
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:30,125
The first hate is unforgettable.

658
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:33,458
Why that sad face?

659
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:35,875
You lose a woman,
you find another woman.

660
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:39,250
Think about tomorrow.
What will you need?

661
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:42,000
Love, adventure, passion.

662
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:44,500
Coming soon in theaters near you!

663
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:48,416
- Leave me alone.
- No. What friend would I be?

664
00:40:48,625 --> 00:40:51,708
You need to forget that girl.

665
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:55,750
- That would be amazing, but how?
- Find a rebound.

666
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:59,791
You're right. I need to erase
Carmelina from my mind.

667
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,125
- Good! Erase her, destroy her.
- Sorry, Carmelina.

668
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:05,458
But I have to erase you.

669
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:13,000
You're a man now. Now come with me,
let's go and forget.

670
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:15,875
I have two girls tonight.

671
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:17,791
Get dressed. I'm going to get them!

672
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,708
Nicolino,
I'll let you forget Carmelina.

673
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:23,958
You'll forget her kisses!

674
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:27,458
You'll forget her cuddles.

675
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:30,000
You'll forget her love.

676
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:33,750
Don't forget about the money
because I don't have a dime!

677
00:42:02,208 --> 00:42:05,666
You are the prettiest one.

678
00:42:05,875 --> 00:42:08,583
Your name will be Lilì.

679
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:12,458
With your hair like this,

680
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:18,708
I like you even more.

681
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:23,916
Oh, no!

682
00:42:24,916 --> 00:42:27,375
Don't change.

683
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:31,458
Don't cut your hair.

684
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:36,625
Don't put a lot of makeup, honey!

685
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:39,708
But you,

686
00:42:39,916 --> 00:42:43,041
you have decided this,

687
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,708
to dress with red clothes

688
00:42:46,916 --> 00:42:49,625
and to get called Gigi.

689
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:54,125
You live like that

690
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:57,125
between shops and clubs.

691
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,541
You eat roast beef,

692
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:04,375
drink only smoothies.

693
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,375
But why?

694
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:08,833
Oh, no, honey.

695
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:12,458
Stay like this, beautiful.

696
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:16,166
With your clean face.

697
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:19,250
With your name Lilì.

698
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:23,791
You're the prettiest.

699
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,916
With your hair like this.

700
00:43:27,916 --> 00:43:33,166
Goodnight, Lilì!

701
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,250
Good morning, sadness!

702
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:56,041
- What's wrong with your friend?
- Wake up, wake up!

703
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:01,375
I will take care of it.
Do you want to hear a joke?

704
00:44:01,583 --> 00:44:03,666
Two people are on a honeymoon.

705
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:06,500
- Honeymoon?
- They're in the sleeper car.

706
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:10,541
- They are holding each other tight.
- Yes. While the train...

707
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:17,750
It goes slowly in the night.

708
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:21,875
I always dreamed of
my honeymoon with her like this.

709
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:25,583
- With me?
- No! What do you want?

710
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:28,833
The bride...

711
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,833
Listen, it's really fun.

712
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:34,958
- The bride?
- No, the joke!

713
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,666
The bride shuts the light off
and starts to undress.

714
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:45,291
What if she will do all this
with another man?

715
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,166
No, she must marry me!
Not another man.

716
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:51,750
Stop it, you are ruining my joke.

717
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:56,416
- She is getting undressed!
- I don't want her to get undressed.

718
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:58,750
He is crazy.

719
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:01,541
I try to make him laugh
and see how he is reacting.

720
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:03,666
- He is on the phone.
- Right.

721
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:08,291
Carmelina is it you?
Thank God I have found you!

722
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,208
Yes, it's me. It's really me.

723
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:15,333
What are you talking about?
Yes, I swear.

724
00:45:15,541 --> 00:45:17,833
I care about you.

725
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:20,416
We are unlucky.

726
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:25,416
Don't cry, Carmela.
Carmelina, Carmelina.

727
00:45:25,625 --> 00:45:27,625
- My love...
- Are you done?

728
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:30,041
My love, don't cry.

729
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:33,458
The right papers have come.

730
00:45:33,666 --> 00:45:36,125
I am not a man anymore,
I am a woman.

731
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,333
We could've gotten married!

732
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:44,833
What happened? Did your cat die?

733
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:48,375
A, B, C. His cat died.
It died on Thursday!

734
00:45:48,583 --> 00:45:52,208
- Meow!
- Go away, black cat!

735
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,791
Nicolino, what's wrong?

736
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,291
Do you have a cat?

737
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,750
I'm chasing it away. Go away!

738
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:06,125
- Damn cats!
- Shall we dance?

739
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:08,750
It's nothing, honey.

740
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:11,166
It's the radio.

741
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:14,541
I assure you, it's the radio.

742
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:17,708
I changed radio station. I swear!

743
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:20,000
- Shall we dance?
- No.

744
00:46:20,208 --> 00:46:22,541
Is this another radio station?

745
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:25,708
You are with another woman!
My mom is right!

746
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:29,458
Now it's over, for good.

747
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:35,541
No, no, no. I am not your love.
I am her mother!

748
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,125
Madam...

749
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:42,041
Please, let me explain.

750
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,375
I will not let you talk.

751
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:49,375
Don't you dare call again.
Do you understand? It's over!

752
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:52,041
Hello? Hello?

753
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,250
Madam! Hello?

754
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:58,208
- She left!
- You did it finally!

755
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:00,958
- Shall we dance?
- It's your fault!

756
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:06,208
Why did you come here?
What guy did I go out with?

757
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:09,125
Nicolino, let's dance!

758
00:47:09,333 --> 00:47:12,041
She left me for good!

759
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:15,541
- You wanted to forget!
- I don't want to forget her anymore.

760
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:19,166
I care too much for her.
I want to see her again.

761
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:22,208
- You must help me.
- Me?

762
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:26,291
Yes. I must talk to her.

763
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,666
I must tell her everything.

764
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:32,541
How can I, Gaetano?

765
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,666
Nicolino, I have an idea.

766
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:45,625
How beautiful!

767
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:49,333
They wrote a letter to Santa Claus.

768
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:51,333
Come.

769
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:53,333
Careful!

770
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:56,458
Carmelina!

771
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,291
It's me!

772
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:04,916
Nicolino, are you crazy?
Mom could come.

773
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,833
- You're handsome dressed like that.
- I want to talk to you. I love you!

774
00:48:10,041 --> 00:48:13,375
- Go to your mom!
- Dad! He slapped me.

775
00:48:13,583 --> 00:48:15,500
Mom, look.

776
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:17,875
Look!

777
00:48:19,708 --> 00:48:22,000
I got you!

778
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:25,458
Rascal! You ruined a family.

779
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:30,541
You must leave. You, walk.

780
00:49:06,625 --> 00:49:09,458
Give me that.
You thought it was money?

781
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:23,083
I saw you! Come in!

782
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:25,250
Come!

783
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:27,666
You, piece of rascal!

784
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:30,166
Go in!

785
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,833
Saint Antonio, peace and wellbeing.

786
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:38,708
Peace and wellbeing.

787
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,458
- Saint Antonio...
- Nicolino, are you crazy?

788
00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:44,916
- Run away!
- Is it you again?

789
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:47,916
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- Madam!

790
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:52,083
How dare you dress like a monk?

791
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:54,541
Sacrilege!

792
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:58,041
- Try come again...
- What kind of people!

793
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:00,958
I'll show you!

794
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:04,750
Go back in. Walk.

795
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:17,666
Salam. Do you know where is Gerace?

796
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:20,625
- Are you looking for the garage?
- Not the garage.

797
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:23,458
I'm looking for the Gerace family.

798
00:50:23,666 --> 00:50:26,500
- Gerace? Who are you?
- A Turkish man.

799
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:30,375
I'm an old friend of captain Gerace,
he died in the tempest.

800
00:50:30,583 --> 00:50:35,125
- Are you a friend of Giosuè?
- Yes, a friend of Giosuè.

801
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:37,500
- Do you know him?
- Come.

802
00:50:38,416 --> 00:50:41,000
You made a useless trip,
they all died.

803
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:44,166
- In the tempest?
- No, various sicknesses.

804
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:47,083
I am alone in a foreign country!

805
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:49,958
No, I will help you,
I will take you to my place.

806
00:50:50,166 --> 00:50:52,500
- This house?
- No, behind that establishment.

807
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:55,500
- There is a poor crazy elephant.
- Come!

808
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:01,708
- Look who I brought you.
- Salam!

809
00:51:01,916 --> 00:51:04,666
- Ham! Who are you?
- It is the cook!

810
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:08,958
- I am a cook.
- He is the Turkish cook!

811
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:13,041
Are you crazy? We don't have
the waiter, and you bring me a cook?

812
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,291
So you don't want to understand!
Show him your tattoo.

813
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,875
- Tatoo... He doesn't understand!
- I don't understand.

814
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:23,583
- Tattoo, flower.
- I understand!

815
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:27,208
He is the only one who survived the
wreck of the Cavalluccio di Mare.

816
00:51:27,416 --> 00:51:29,625
- So?
- Do I speak Turkish?

817
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:31,791
I speak Turkish!

818
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:36,541
- The Turkish man of Giosuè's ship.
- Exactly.

819
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:39,041
- Did you figure out my plan?
- Yes.

820
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:42,416
You want to substitute
the Turkish man with another person.

821
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:44,916
It is difficult to find someone.

822
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:47,916
I have someone, it's you!

823
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:53,041
- You are dumb!
- Yes, yes. You are dumb.

824
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:56,708
- Absolutely dumb.
- He says that too.

825
00:51:56,916 --> 00:51:58,916
You are dumb!

826
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:04,083
Gaetanino, I need your help.

827
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:07,375
I must sweeten up
Mrs. Amalia's heart.

828
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,875
Only you can do it.

829
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:13,083
You must get her to her weak spot.
Help me.

830
00:52:13,291 --> 00:52:16,791
I don't know about Giosuè and Amalia!

831
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,291
- Let's just ask!
- Let's just ask!

832
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,083
- What about the tattoo...
- That's easy.

833
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:26,500
- You will do it here.
- What tattoo!

834
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:29,416
- Where should we put this wacko?
- In the bathroom.

835
00:52:30,666 --> 00:52:33,208
- Where should he sleep?
- In the bath tub.

836
00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:37,708
- What will he eat?
- Nothing!

837
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:40,958
- What if he will protest?
- I will bite his head.

838
00:52:41,666 --> 00:52:46,458
I will not impersonate
the Turkish sailor. No!

839
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:53,666
- Mom!
- Who's there?

840
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:56,166
Nicolino dressed like a Turkish man.

841
00:52:56,375 --> 00:52:58,583
Again? You don't move.

842
00:52:58,791 --> 00:53:01,791
I will take care of him.

843
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:11,916
- Salam.
- Who are you?

844
00:53:13,666 --> 00:53:15,875
Gerace live here?

845
00:53:16,666 --> 00:53:17,875
Yes, why?

846
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:24,125
You must be Amalia,
the wife of my friend Giosuè.

847
00:53:24,333 --> 00:53:27,833
- I am...
- No, don't talk.

848
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:31,166
You are Muzafer Kayan, the cook.

849
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,958
- Come in.
- The Turkish cook.

850
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:38,708
Carmelina, Sisinella, look.

851
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:41,875
- Look who is here.
- Muzafer! Dad's friend.

852
00:53:42,083 --> 00:53:44,125
Yes, it's him.

853
00:53:45,166 --> 00:53:47,875
Excuse me, come in.

854
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:50,708
Yes, yes.

855
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:53,958
My God! Excuse me.

856
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:59,291
Excuse me for getting emotional.
You here, all of a sudden.

857
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,833
Come.

858
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:07,208
Giosuè, look who is here.
Do you recognize him?

859
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:11,583
He can't recognize me, Amalia!
Many years have passed.

860
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:15,291
Look how beautiful he is on his ship,
the Cavalluccio di Mare.

861
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,666
Do you recognize him?

862
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:20,416
Giosuè! My friend.

863
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:23,625
This is your house. Give me your hat.

864
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:27,041
Sit down.
Can I offer you a coffee, a drink?

865
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:31,000
I don't want to bother you,
maybe something to eat.

866
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:33,833
Yes. Sisinella, Carmelina,
go to the kitchen

867
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:37,333
and bring all that you
can find. Sit down.

868
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:40,333
Sit down.

869
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:45,625
Now you must tell me
all about the shipwreck.

870
00:54:47,208 --> 00:54:51,541
Why do you want me to tell you that?
Let go of that!

871
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:55,875
I want to know.

872
00:54:56,083 --> 00:55:01,000
During the typhoon,
where was Giosuè?

873
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,958
- On the ship.
- Yes, this I know.

874
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:08,000
I want to know where
he was on the ship.

875
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:11,375
He was on...

876
00:55:11,583 --> 00:55:15,333
On... You know how he was.

877
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:18,041
He could never stand still.

878
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:22,500
- And then? Tell me!
- Then the wind got stronger.

879
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:26,458
You know about the wind
when it starts to blow.

880
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:32,208
The captain realized
that the ship was in danger

881
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:37,083
and so he screamed at me
"Gaetano, let's save ourselves!"

882
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:39,958
"Let's wear a lifesaver!"

883
00:55:40,958 --> 00:55:44,333
Instead of Muzafer
he'd call you Gaetano?

884
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:47,125
Because he was scared.

885
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:50,291
He called me Gaetano
and I called him Vincenzo.

886
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,041
Your real name doesn't matter
in such moments.

887
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:58,083
Just the memory of it
and I have goosebumps. Look.

888
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:02,708
The waves were as tall as mountains.

889
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:06,916
All the sharks around us
looked like anchovies.

890
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:12,250
And then, the typhoon arrived.

891
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:27,750
Careful with the sail,
the wind is blowing.

892
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:37,958
When the wind starts blowing
the ship swerves.

893
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:42,375
The wind is blowing.

894
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:46,041
The sails get tangled.

895
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:52,208
The tempest!

896
00:56:55,458 --> 00:57:01,708
It rains, the bow becomes shiny

897
00:57:04,041 --> 00:57:08,166
and bright.

898
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:13,166
The sky looks like ink.

899
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:16,916
The tree mast

900
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:23,583
looks like silver.

901
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:31,583
Lighthouse,
why are you lighting?

902
00:57:39,625 --> 00:57:44,250
We know how to get home
even at night.

903
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:56,416
The wind is blowing,
the sails are getting tangled.

904
00:57:58,333 --> 00:58:01,291
This is sirocco.

905
00:58:03,916 --> 00:58:09,250
But those who love the sea,
and are loved back by the sea,

906
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,833
they are rich.

907
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:26,541
Careful with the wind!

908
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:34,458
Let's go west!

909
00:58:34,666 --> 00:58:37,458
West!

910
00:58:43,416 --> 00:58:46,750
The movie theater is opening up.
He should have been here by four.

911
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:49,500
- I don't understand.
- It's my business!

912
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:52,541
Now I understand.
Business is business.

913
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:55,375
If Gaetano doesn't come back,
you will see!

914
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:58,500
Are you satisfied?
Do you want something else?

915
00:58:58,708 --> 00:59:01,958
No, thank you. My belly is full.

916
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:06,833
- Dessert was very good.
- It was dad's favorite.

917
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:09,083
Carmelina, bring coffee.

918
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:14,000
- Your daughter is very cute.
- Thank you.

919
00:59:14,208 --> 00:59:16,916
- Is she engaged?
- Not at all!

920
00:59:17,125 --> 00:59:20,791
- She doesn't even think about it.
- She always thinks about Nicolino!

921
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,833
- His name is Nicolino.
- You shut up and leave.

922
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:27,166
Nicolino is a nice name.

923
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:29,375
He must be a good guy.

924
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:33,083
Don't you say this name
in my house. Excuse me.

925
00:59:33,291 --> 00:59:35,458
- Of course.
- Here is coffee.

926
00:59:36,583 --> 00:59:40,333
- Your daughter looks like you.
- It's not true.

927
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:43,833
Everybody says
that I look like my dad.

928
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:46,291
Your dad? Are you kidding me!

929
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,541
You look so much like your mother!

930
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:51,916
The same deep dark eyes.

931
00:59:53,083 --> 00:59:55,000
Very passionate.

932
00:59:55,208 --> 01:00:00,166
The mouth the color of
strawberries at five in the morning.

933
01:00:00,375 --> 01:00:04,750
A velvety clear skin, like apricots
in the first days of July.

934
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:08,958
Hair like silk, a wave.

935
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,208
- Excuse me.
- My sweater!

936
01:00:13,416 --> 01:00:17,333
Don't worry, this is
a weak coffee. It will go away.

937
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:20,875
Carmelina, Sisinella, come!
Bring some water.

938
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:25,708
Good heaven!

939
01:00:26,875 --> 01:00:30,250
The rose. The same rose of Giosuè!

940
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:33,083
Identical.

941
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:35,666
Do you mind?

942
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:39,708
It has been too many years that
I've seen this only in pictures.

943
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:43,291
This is the only rose

944
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,458
that survived the shipwreck.

945
01:00:46,666 --> 01:00:49,250
If you want it, it's yours.
I am offering it to you.

946
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:54,666
What? What do you want me to say?

947
01:00:54,916 --> 01:00:59,166
I... I'm shaking.

948
01:01:00,958 --> 01:01:03,125
Excuse me.

949
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:05,583
I will open in 5 minutes.

950
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:08,041
Stop! First you will have to kill me.

951
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:11,125
He is a friend of mine. Stop!

952
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:14,125
Gaetano, help me.
Look what happened because of you.

953
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:19,166
Me?
Go inside, the movie will start soon!

954
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:22,458
- How can we start over?
- Let's put on another reel.

955
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:25,166
They will understand.

956
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,625
- It's just a question of fantasy.
- Listen.

957
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:29,458
You dream!

958
01:01:29,666 --> 01:01:32,500
"Bread, Love and Dreams",
I saw it in turkey!

959
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:35,500
Good, but now shut up.

960
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:38,416
Did you talk to her?

961
01:01:38,625 --> 01:01:42,125
Nicolino, you must calm down!

962
01:01:42,333 --> 01:01:44,583
First we have to know
each other better.

963
01:01:44,791 --> 01:01:48,000
Give me time.

964
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,333
Armando, the newspaper is clear.

965
01:01:52,541 --> 01:01:56,375
For delicate skins
you need an egg mask.

966
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:59,291
I am not an expert, ask my wife.

967
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:04,208
- Here, is it good?
- No. It's not good.

968
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:08,458
It will need the red
of the strawberries

969
01:02:08,666 --> 01:02:11,708
at five in the morning.
You understand me, Armando?

970
01:02:11,916 --> 01:02:15,583
I'd wake up at five in the morning
only when I was a soldier.

971
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:19,708
And I wouldn't look
at the color of the strawberries!

972
01:02:19,916 --> 01:02:22,791
Gaetanino, tell her something.

973
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,666
I am warming her up.

974
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,333
When the time comes
I will tell her something.

975
01:02:28,541 --> 01:02:32,750
- Listen! Will you talk to her?
- I will try.

976
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:34,791
But I can't promise.

977
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,875
Today is Sunday, they made lasagne.

978
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:42,083
You know what happens in these cases.

979
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:45,916
You are always making up excuses!

980
01:02:46,125 --> 01:02:49,875
The cat to be quick
made blind kittens.

981
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:53,458
- Do you want to be like the cat?
- No. I want to marry Carmelina!

982
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:57,791
Don't worry, go home and wait for me.

983
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Take care of the Turkish man.

984
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:03,708
I don't understand why Amalia
put Sisinella in boarding school.

985
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:07,000
She says that she needed
a good education

986
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:09,583
and that she would stay home
doing nothing.

987
01:03:09,791 --> 01:03:12,666
No, this is not the reason.

988
01:03:12,875 --> 01:03:16,625
Since the Turkish man arrived,
everything is crazy in this house.

989
01:03:16,833 --> 01:03:18,291
Here he is.

990
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,750
- Are we eating?
- It's you.

991
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:23,583
Sit down, lunch will be served soon.

992
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:26,875
Amalia isn't here yet?

993
01:03:27,083 --> 01:03:29,458
No. Annunziata
will take you company.

994
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:31,208
What fun!

995
01:03:34,291 --> 01:03:37,208
- I would like to be with you alone.
- With me?

996
01:03:37,416 --> 01:03:42,166
- I would like to talk to you.
- There is nothing to do with me!

997
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:46,750
What did you understand? I have
to tell you something important.

998
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:50,583
And so? This is a respectable house.

999
01:03:50,791 --> 01:03:52,791
Do you think this is your harem?

1000
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,291
Excuse me if I am late,
you know how these hairdressers are!

1001
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,875
- Between one lock and another...
- Mom, what did you do?

1002
01:04:02,083 --> 01:04:04,875
You don't like me?

1003
01:04:05,083 --> 01:04:07,291
Don't listen to her.

1004
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,875
You are amazing!

1005
01:04:10,083 --> 01:04:14,708
Let's make a toast
to your wonderful transformation.

1006
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:18,416
- Thank you.
- I'd prefer poison!

1007
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:21,750
- What do you mean?
- Don't you mind her.

1008
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:25,083
She doesn't deserve your kindness.

1009
01:04:25,416 --> 01:04:28,541
I know who is she thinking about!

1010
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:31,500
Yes, I am thinking
about him. My Nini.

1011
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:35,625
He is so beautiful
and I am so in love with him.

1012
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:38,083
Come on dear, don't cry.

1013
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,333
It's a fixation!

1014
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:43,708
- Nicolino.
- I don't know any Nicolino.

1015
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:47,583
If Amalia doesn't want to...
She is the owner!

1016
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:52,500
Don't cry,
don't make her cry. Poor girl!

1017
01:04:52,708 --> 01:04:57,041
This daughter
is making my existence bitter.

1018
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:04,208
I went home so cheerful.
So happy.

1019
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:10,666
You must stay like that Amelia.
Think about yourself.

1020
01:05:10,875 --> 01:05:12,708
Like I do.

1021
01:05:33,416 --> 01:05:36,000
I don't want to keep closed

1022
01:05:36,625 --> 01:05:40,000
these paper flowers.

1023
01:05:41,666 --> 01:05:45,333
The real flowers are blooming

1024
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:48,875
in the garden for you.

1025
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:54,125
Spring

1026
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:56,833
is here!

1027
01:05:57,625 --> 01:06:01,916
Trees are becoming purple.

1028
01:06:03,958 --> 01:06:07,916
A bird is coming to say,

1029
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:13,416
"I learned how to fly."

1030
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:19,750
Years have passed.

1031
01:06:19,958 --> 01:06:23,000
Seasons are flying.

1032
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:26,000
Songs are changing.

1033
01:06:26,208 --> 01:06:29,166
But not you, you are always the same.

1034
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:32,625
For me you are still beautiful

1035
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:35,416
because I love you.

1036
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:40,916
The world is sad
if you don't laugh anymore.

1037
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:44,083
Put some make up on.

1038
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:47,375
Comb your hair.

1039
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:50,916
Wear a brooch.

1040
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:54,625
Come close to me.

1041
01:06:55,958 --> 01:06:59,208
This mirror

1042
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:02,208
can do love miracles.

1043
01:07:02,416 --> 01:07:05,416
My heart still trembles

1044
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:09,958
and falls in love with you.

1045
01:07:15,416 --> 01:07:18,000
Saint Gennaro, help Gaetanino.

1046
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:20,333
Give him strength and courage.

1047
01:07:23,708 --> 01:07:26,083
What do you think, will he make it?

1048
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:28,166
- No, no.
- No? I say yes!

1049
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:31,041
- Yes.
- He will come and say:

1050
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:33,750
Run to Carmelina,
she is waiting for you!

1051
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:36,166
- I will go and kiss her.
- No!

1052
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:38,583
No? Finally!

1053
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:43,291
- So?
- I must talk to you.

1054
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:46,458
- Did something bad happened?
- No, actually...

1055
01:07:46,666 --> 01:07:50,041
- It went well for me, but for you...
- What?

1056
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:55,500
- Salam, go away.
- Me?

1057
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,333
Speak.

1058
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:09,083
Nicolino, you must be brave.

1059
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:13,375
I can't let you marry Carmelina,
my new position forbids me.

1060
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:15,916
What position?

1061
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:20,041
Me and Amalia love each other
and we will get married.

1062
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:24,125
- What?
- As Carmelina's father, I can't.

1063
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:29,166
- Coward, traitor! What did you do?
- Calm down, Nicolino.

1064
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:32,583
Why do you take it out on me?
It wasn't my fault if I fell in love.

1065
01:08:32,791 --> 01:08:35,583
If I am not getting married,
neither will you.

1066
01:08:35,791 --> 01:08:40,291
I will take the Turkish man
to Mrs. Amelia.

1067
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,541
- Muzafer!
- If she finds out about that,

1068
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:44,750
it would be bad for you too.

1069
01:08:46,541 --> 01:08:48,583
Oh, man! I lost the Turkish man.

1070
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,541
Gaetanino!
Help me, I lost the Turkish man.

1071
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:55,916
I don't care, I am going.
Amelia is waiting for me.

1072
01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:58,250
Muzafer! Muzafer!

1073
01:09:04,916 --> 01:09:08,541
Are you looking for the Turkish man?
He is on the terrace.

1074
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,541
- Muzafer!
- He got crazy!

1075
01:09:23,875 --> 01:09:27,208
- What are you doing?
- I am praying Allah. Pray as well.

1076
01:09:27,416 --> 01:09:29,250
Let's go.

1077
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:35,583
Wait! Here lives Giosuè's wife.
The Gerace family.

1078
01:09:35,791 --> 01:09:38,958
- You said that everybody died.
- I will explain later. Let's go!

1079
01:09:39,166 --> 01:09:42,250
I understand.
We are going to the funeral.

1080
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:47,333
I know someone
who deserves a funeral.

1081
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:50,375
What happened to you?

1082
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:53,125
Carmelina thought
that you committed suicide.

1083
01:09:53,333 --> 01:09:56,250
Another Turkish man!
There was a landing?

1084
01:09:56,458 --> 01:09:58,541
I'll tell you later.
Is Carmelina home?

1085
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:01,583
- She is doing laundry.
- Alone?

1086
01:10:01,791 --> 01:10:06,416
Yes, alone.
Amalia lives in Turkey now!

1087
01:10:06,958 --> 01:10:09,291
I will take her with me,
I'll kidnap her.

1088
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:12,125
- Take care of him.
- No, I am afraid!

1089
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:14,583
It's very good. I'll be back soon.

1090
01:10:14,791 --> 01:10:18,541
- Are you going to the funeral?
- Funeral?

1091
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:23,541
- What funeral?
- You are ignorant.

1092
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:26,166
- No, you are dumb!
- Me?

1093
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:28,375
Yes, you are dumb.

1094
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,541
Carmelina!

1095
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:38,083
Carmelina, I am here!

1096
01:10:39,166 --> 01:10:43,166
Nicolino! How did you find out
that I was here alone?

1097
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:46,750
I live thinking about you.

1098
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:50,416
Are you really alone?

1099
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:53,041
Yes, mom is downstairs.

1100
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,000
I can't believe...

1101
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:59,666
We are here alone.

1102
01:10:59,875 --> 01:11:04,416
- It's the first time.
- I know, but what is this for?

1103
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:08,166
- Can I help you?
- Thank you.

1104
01:11:24,875 --> 01:11:27,208
I can't see you but I feel you.

1105
01:11:32,833 --> 01:11:35,541
Should I come to the other side?

1106
01:11:40,791 --> 01:11:43,291
You have nothing to say?

1107
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:50,666
- Carmelina!
- What do you want?

1108
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:54,416
- Don't dare come closer.
- And I will come closer anyway.

1109
01:11:54,625 --> 01:11:58,083
We are not even engaged.

1110
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:02,458
Carmelina, what are we?
I still have to understand that!

1111
01:12:02,666 --> 01:12:06,625
We are engaged every other month.
Parents of a child who doesn't exist.

1112
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:09,708
In love without even
being able to say it.

1113
01:12:09,916 --> 01:12:13,833
Now that we are finally alone,
you don't want me to get closer.

1114
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:18,000
I'm coming closer, Carmelina.
Don't you say a word?

1115
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:21,708
Careful, Nicolino.
You can ruin me.

1116
01:12:21,916 --> 01:12:23,833
Run away, then!

1117
01:12:25,666 --> 01:12:29,416
- Of course I will run away!
- Wait, I must tell you something.

1118
01:12:29,625 --> 01:12:32,625
I could never do it
and I don't know if I will now.

1119
01:12:34,916 --> 01:12:38,583
- Should I tell you, Carmelina?
- What? Are you crazy?

1120
01:12:38,791 --> 01:12:41,041
No, but I will get crazy.

1121
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:45,708
Aren't you running away?
Carmelina, aren't you?

1122
01:12:46,458 --> 01:12:48,500
I'm running away.

1123
01:12:48,708 --> 01:12:52,166
Carmelina, I...
Damn, it is so difficult!

1124
01:12:53,041 --> 01:12:55,500
I care for you.

1125
01:12:55,708 --> 01:12:58,916
Nicolino, I didn't hear you.

1126
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,166
I care for you.

1127
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:04,791
I care for you!

1128
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,583
See, how beautiful is this word?

1129
01:13:07,791 --> 01:13:10,541
I care for you!

1130
01:13:11,333 --> 01:13:13,458
There is no one here?

1131
01:13:13,666 --> 01:13:15,583
I care for you!

1132
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:18,166
Carmelina. Am I crazy?

1133
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:22,041
Nicolino, I am crazy.

1134
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:24,041
I care for you.

1135
01:13:29,875 --> 01:13:32,416
Did you hear? It's you again!

1136
01:13:32,625 --> 01:13:35,708
You said that you wouldn't dirty
your hands with me.

1137
01:13:35,916 --> 01:13:38,416
No. In fact I will not.

1138
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:42,416
Muzafer,
throw this person down the stairs.

1139
01:13:43,416 --> 01:13:46,791
Gaetano, don't move. Downstairs
there is the real Turkish man!

1140
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,875
- He is ready to act.
- What are you talking about?

1141
01:13:51,083 --> 01:13:54,166
- Do you know each other?
- It is possible.

1142
01:13:54,375 --> 01:13:56,916
When you are at sea,
you meet lots of people.

1143
01:13:57,125 --> 01:14:01,458
What are you talking about?
You can't even swim!

1144
01:14:01,666 --> 01:14:03,958
He is not a sailor.

1145
01:14:04,166 --> 01:14:08,083
I sent him to your house
to have some help from the inside.

1146
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:12,458
This is what you made me do
keeping me from seeing Carmelina.

1147
01:14:12,666 --> 01:14:16,625
- Who are you, then?
- I will tell you who he is.

1148
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:20,916
He is a rascal, a puppet,
a betrayer of friendship

1149
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:22,875
for a little bit of food!

1150
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:26,333
Daddy's friend,
the only one who survived.

1151
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:29,458
He never even
took the ferry to Capri.

1152
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:34,166
Daddy's friend is downstairs.
I will go get him and bring him up.

1153
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:41,875
- Listen, don't be vile!
- You'll pay for what you did to me.

1154
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:45,500
- They will kill each other!
- Don't move.

1155
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:56,458
Now you also know

1156
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:59,666
what it means to be in love.

1157
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:02,833
They didn't die. You are bringing
bad luck to this building.

1158
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:06,291
We will need lots of incense. Go!

1159
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,583
- Go!
- You ruined me!

1160
01:15:08,791 --> 01:15:11,916
- After all that I did for you!
- I will make you go on a boat.

1161
01:15:12,125 --> 01:15:14,333
- But on an hospital boat!
- Gaetano!

1162
01:15:14,541 --> 01:15:18,166
- I will send you to the hospital.
- Nicolino! Gaetano!

1163
01:15:18,375 --> 01:15:21,041
Miss, come here.

1164
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:24,833
- Is she Mrs. Gerace?
- There she is.

1165
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:27,791
This is another Turkish man.
He says that you were dead.

1166
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:35,041
Who are you?

1167
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:44,208
Are you slapping me?
I am your best friend!

1168
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:52,750
And you treat me like that
after all that I did for you?

1169
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:57,250
Nicolino...

1170
01:15:58,125 --> 01:16:00,333
We grew up together!

1171
01:16:03,666 --> 01:16:08,000
You knew that I was in love!

1172
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:16,916
It's not my fault if I fell in love too!

1173
01:16:23,041 --> 01:16:24,916
Gaetanino...

1174
01:16:25,125 --> 01:16:29,166
- Are you in love for real?
- Yes.

1175
01:16:30,208 --> 01:16:33,041
Come here, Gaetanino.

1176
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:35,666
Come here!

1177
01:16:40,333 --> 01:16:44,250
You aren't dead!
You're alive. I don't understand.

1178
01:16:44,458 --> 01:16:48,666
You understand very well!
I am dead, dead!

1179
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:52,416
I don't want to hear again about
Giosuè, Turkish men and ships.

1180
01:16:52,625 --> 01:16:55,500
Don't you bother me anymore.

1181
01:16:55,708 --> 01:17:00,375
- We don't accept visits anymore.
- I understood that!

1182
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:03,708
She is not dead, she is alive.

1183
01:17:03,916 --> 01:17:07,416
Everybody tricked me,
poor Turkish man.

1184
01:17:07,958 --> 01:17:11,791
I will punish the guilty.

1185
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,750
Good heavens! Gaetano, Nicolino...

1186
01:17:22,833 --> 01:17:25,291
So you will learn
not to make fun of me!

1187
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:29,208
Amalia, Carmelina, come down!

1188
01:17:29,416 --> 01:17:32,375
The Turkish man is beating them up.

1189
01:17:35,208 --> 01:17:37,333
Mrs. Annunziata!

1190
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:40,500
The Turkish man is beating up
Gaetano and Nicolino.

1191
01:17:40,708 --> 01:17:44,500
- What is going on?
- Thank God! Someone is coming up.

1192
01:17:45,875 --> 01:17:47,666
Nicolino?

1193
01:17:48,541 --> 01:17:50,375
What did you do to him?

1194
01:17:57,833 --> 01:18:02,041
My Nicolino! Are you alive?
What did they do to you?

1195
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:05,000
I don't know.

1196
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:08,291
Send him away.
I don't want to see him anymore.

1197
01:18:10,583 --> 01:18:14,583
- Amalia, forgive me.
- After all, he did it for love!

1198
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:16,791
I care for you.

1199
01:18:28,791 --> 01:18:31,208
Nicolino, I care for you.

1200
01:18:43,708 --> 01:18:47,083
Nicolino, I have decided.
I will say it in front of everybody!

1201
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:50,833
- I will run away with you!
- No.

1202
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:55,125
Are you coming by yourself
or with your mother?

1203
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:03,000
Carmelina, be good. I'm your mother.

1204
01:19:03,208 --> 01:19:05,375
Come upstairs and bring Nicolino too.

1205
01:19:05,583 --> 01:19:07,750
Nicolino, obey. It's better for you.

1206
01:19:07,958 --> 01:19:11,541
Obey, Nicolino.
I fixed everything for you too.

1207
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,583
Amelia, a little bit of patience.

1208
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:28,125
Poor mom, maybe I shouldn't do it.

1209
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:33,083
Let's make an experiment.

1210
01:19:37,125 --> 01:19:40,750
Pretty girl, come upstairs
because I have to forgive you.

1211
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:44,541
Nicolino, come upstairs.
We have already forgiven you!

1212
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:48,333
I am your father,
we are getting married!

1213
01:19:55,333 --> 01:19:57,125
Young man!

1214
01:19:58,333 --> 01:20:01,125
You can't kiss in the street.

1215
01:20:02,166 --> 01:20:04,666
- Did you see everything?
- Everything.

1216
01:20:04,875 --> 01:20:08,291
Then fine us,
do whatever you want.

1217
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:10,500
I want you as my best man.

1218
01:20:22,583 --> 01:20:26,208
Amalia, now that our children
have left happily,

1219
01:20:26,416 --> 01:20:30,916
let's take care of our happiness.
I am in a hurry!

1220
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:34,875
I am so confused.
How can I say no to you?

1221
01:20:35,083 --> 01:20:39,708
Muzafer, Gaetanino,
you must calm down.

1222
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:43,916
Did you ask permission
to your mother?

1223
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:48,833
Do you have a mother as well?

1224
01:20:51,166 --> 01:20:56,208
Come closer.
What are you doing there standing?

1225
01:20:56,416 --> 01:21:00,166
Why did you come visit me?

1226
01:21:00,375 --> 01:21:02,250
Mom, I told you already.

1227
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:05,208
We came to discuss
with you our wedding.

1228
01:21:05,416 --> 01:21:08,166
Wedding? Who is the groom?

1229
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:12,958
- Me, mom!
- Mom?

1230
01:21:13,166 --> 01:21:15,916
When did I have you?

1231
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:19,583
He is calling you "mom"
because he is the groom.

1232
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:22,833
He is the groom and this is why
he is calling me "mom".

1233
01:21:23,041 --> 01:21:26,000
Come forward, sit and talk to me.

1234
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,666
Go.

1235
01:21:32,791 --> 01:21:35,208
Come closer. He is shy!

1236
01:21:37,583 --> 01:21:40,333
You look like an angel.

1237
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:42,916
You are so curly!

1238
01:21:43,916 --> 01:21:45,750
- What is your name?
- Gaetano.

1239
01:21:45,958 --> 01:21:47,750
Gaetano. What a nice name!

1240
01:21:47,958 --> 01:21:49,875
How old are you?

1241
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:53,916
- 34.
- 34? What a nice age!

1242
01:21:54,125 --> 01:21:57,083
- What is your job?
- I am a...

1243
01:21:57,291 --> 01:22:00,333
- Knife grinder? I don't like it.
- No!

1244
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:03,208
- I'm a projector.
- A projector?

1245
01:22:03,416 --> 01:22:05,458
Film projector.

1246
01:22:05,666 --> 01:22:08,666
- Film...
- I work at the movie theater.

1247
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:12,291
How long have you been dating?

1248
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,500
- It has been almost 20 days.
- 20 days?

1249
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:19,541
Like cats? And do you call this love?

1250
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:23,125
- It's terrible!
- I love him, mom!

1251
01:22:23,333 --> 01:22:25,166
What mom and mom!

1252
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:28,583
The mother of the mother
of the first mother of my mother

1253
01:22:28,791 --> 01:22:30,958
used to say that to know a man well

1254
01:22:31,166 --> 01:22:34,125
you must use seven barrels of salt.

1255
01:22:34,333 --> 01:22:39,250
You must know each other,
get to know each other well.

1256
01:22:39,458 --> 01:22:42,958
You need time.
Three years is my verdict.

1257
01:22:44,583 --> 01:22:46,833
Here we go again!

1258
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:52,458
You, your mom, and I
walking around Toledo.

1259
01:22:52,666 --> 01:22:56,458
We walk ahead
and your mother walks behind us.

1260
01:22:56,666 --> 01:22:59,708
You, your mom, and I.
I am in trouble!

1261
01:22:59,916 --> 01:23:02,541
You, your mom, and I.
Who'd make me do?

1262
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:07,166
You, your mom, and I.
What a sin did I do?

1263
01:23:07,375 --> 01:23:10,166
You, your mom, and I.
