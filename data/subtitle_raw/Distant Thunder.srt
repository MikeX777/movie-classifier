<b>DISTANT THUNDER</b>

2
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,170
- Will he sell us some?
- Yes!

3
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,800
What is it?
What do you want?

4
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,570
Give me a good price
for the tomatoes.

5
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,710
They look tasty.

6
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,500
Smell good too.

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,600
Come in.

8
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,430
Let's go.

9
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,930
So stuffy!

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,860
They're like red bulbs!

11
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,910
Don't touch them!
You might ruin them.

12
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,410
This is farmer's hard work.

13
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,510
The tomatoes in the
supermarkets are rotten.

14
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,810
They're red because
they're rotten.

15
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,210
Look closely.

16
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,410
Ours are red too,
but the glimmer is different.

17
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,970
Everybody knows that,
so they sent us to have a look.

18
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,100
- They said you're scary.
- Yes!

19
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,860
We're the special squad!

20
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,690
This is not a tourist farm!

21
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,820
We came to greet you
as neighbours!

22
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,520
What neighbours?

23
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,520
I'll sell you some.
You have containers?

24
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,760
Give us 300 yen of them,
we'll try those first.

Mitsuo.

39
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,560
I'm hungry. Let me through.

40
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,220
Koji's here.

41
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,540
Koji! Mitsuo's here.

42
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,940
Delivery?

43
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,440
I grew them well.
I'm so busy!

44
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,040
Lunch!

45
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,830
Good timing. Eat with me.
Mrs. Wada, you coming?

46
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,840
The director called me.
He said he wants to talk.

47
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,750
Let's go, Mitsuo.

48
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,270
Mitsuo.

49
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,510
Mr. Hanamura,
my second son Mitsuo.

50
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,200
Welcome.

51
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,550
You are here!

52
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,650
Please wait.

53
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,740
I'm hungry. Menu please.

54
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,450
Curry rice. Coffee.

55
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,110
- The same for me.
- Yes!

56
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,630
Hey. You know her?

57
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,490
She came to the greenhouse,
and bought tomatoes.

58
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,230
We sell liquor at night.

59
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,250
Come for a drink next time.

60
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,200
Will I see your kids
and husband?

61
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,320
Sorry, I'm not married.

62
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,960
Just me and my friend.

63
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,240
We run this together.

64
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,500
We work shifts.

65
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,980
And look after
each other's kids.

66
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,280
Here you are.

67
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,260
Come help me at the
greenhouse some time.

68
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,330
One day?

69
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,750
OK. Next time, you come
to my field and help me.

70
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,190
Hey. Will you really
come to have a drink?

71
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,610
What's up?

72
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,830
You haven't paid.

73
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,380
Sorry.

74
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,340
Murder?

75
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,810
Childbirth?
Happens all the time.

76
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,450
It's like a bomb!

77
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,210
Makes me die sooner!

78
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,050
Doesn't matter.
I'm old anyway.

79
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,620
Granny.

80
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,620
"Apartment women"
have an easy life.

81
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,640
I can't believe it.

82
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,150
You can call an ambulance
when you give birth.

83
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,920
Bothering the Fire Dept.!

84
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,520
"In heaven,
where the sun rises...

85
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,450
I helped hundreds
of people give birth.

86
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,720
When I gave birth
to your father,

87
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,020
no one helped me.

88
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,900
I was weeding and
I felt unwell.

89
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,720
I got home but fainted
in the kitchen.

90
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,480
The moment I fainted,
the baby came out smoothly.

91
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:28,170
Once I gave birth smoothly
while sleeping with a crying baby.

92
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,110
Smoothly?

93
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,100
I'll make you...

94
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,310
You done eating?

95
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,120
But I went out
and bought something...

96
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,730
A farmer buying vegetables!

97
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,630
Granny.

98
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,430
Switch it off if you
aren't watching.

99
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,830
Stop behaving like
a mad woman!

100
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,940
What's on your mind!

101
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,490
Mitsuo. You have a girl?

102
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,330
What? I was shocked.

103
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,500
Do you have a girl or not?
Don't keep it a secret.

104
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,700
No, I don't.

105
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,700
OK. OK.

106
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,200
I've got someone for you.
Interested?

107
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,660
Mr. Hanamura's daughter.

108
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,900
She went to the same school as you,
she now works at a gas station.

109
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,670
3 years younger than you.

110
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,480
She knows you're hardworking.

111
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,290
How about that?

112
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,170
Think about it.

113
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,540
Let's meet her.

114
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,740
But it won't work out.

115
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,740
Her father...

116
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,740
It won't be easy.

117
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,030
You're right but...

118
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,040
I'll meet her.

119
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,430
You're back.

120
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,110
Koji is here.

121
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,290
- Thanks for coming.
- Good it's raining.

122
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,750
We were just saying,

123
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:00,290
Koji is much slower than you.

124
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,280
Doing young people's
work makes me younger.

125
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,190
Corny.

126
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,980
You're popular with men.

127
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,090
I've known you for 20 years.

128
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,370
Didn't know you were so popular.

129
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,800
Save that dirty chat
for the construction site.

130
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,650
I won't behave like dad.

131
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,890
I'll go on a blind date.

132
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,710
With your looks,

133
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,910
you'll be turned down.

134
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,410
Apartment women
don't like your type.

135
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,910
- Jerk!
- Let go!

136
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,940
Energetic young men.

137
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,510
If I don't like her,
introduce her to Koji.

138
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:30,060
Lots of hair wax.
Must be "Regent".

139
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,110
My hair's not dry yet.

140
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,060
Guys. Wanna play?

141
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,300
Just drinking.

142
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,950
We got girls to drink with you.

143
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,220
Beer. All you can drink.
5,000 yen.

144
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,630
4,000 for two of us.

145
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,820
- Stingy.
- No.

146
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,800
OK.

147
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,810
Let's go drink.

148
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,230
<i>Midori, go to table 321.</i>

149
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,720
<i>Ai, calling Ai.</i>

150
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,200
Sorry.

151
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,280
I waited so long.

152
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,670
Too busy. Not enough girls.

153
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,450
Sorry. I'll be back.

154
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,730
No way. Not here.

155
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,230
Want an extension?

156
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,030
<i>I'd extend.
I want to touch some more.</i>

157
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,030
Welcome.

158
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,570
What would you like?

159
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,440
Beer.

160
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,240
Is Chee here?

161
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,870
That's me.

162
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,790
How's my father?

163
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,680
Oh you...
You're his...

164
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,070
You're here to take him home?

165
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,030
I'll call him down?

166
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,940
If I see him,
I may punch him.

167
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,060
I'm knitting a sweater for him.

168
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,390
The sweater of love.

169
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,070
It's getting hotter.

170
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:01,060
He'll wear it this winter.

171
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,080
Bye.

172
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:15,480
Don't. It's your dad's shop.
Help yourself.

173
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,550
He sure helped himself.

174
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,250
The glasses, the fridge,
the phone, the chairs,

175
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,850
key money for this place.

176
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,850
The land he sold
pays for all that.

177
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,750
He has it easy!

178
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,550
Welcome.

179
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,080
So glad you're here.

180
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,130
Sorry it's like a cesspit here.

181
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,050
The construction of
the assembly hall is finished.

182
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,050
Lots of workers just came.

183
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,900
They were so noisy.

184
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,620
Your friend came too,
but he already left.

185
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,660
Koji was here?

186
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,030
- That's his name?
- Yes.

187
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,610
Thanks a lot.

188
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,370
On the house.

189
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,140
Thanks.

190
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,760
I'll have a bottle.

191
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,970
I got rich!

192
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,760
TOMATO MAN

193
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,440
It's like a pumpkin.

194
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,670
Let's drink.

195
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,900
Can I have some?

196
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:46,450
I'll have it straight.

197
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,510
Are you really single?

198
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,360
Divorced.

199
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,700
I'm free, but it's
tough making a living.

200
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,760
How old are you?

201
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,410
23.

202
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,840
Good. You can do
anything you like.

203
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,300
You have the energy
to do anything.

204
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,650
The prime of manhood.

205
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,680
Can't do anything.
And nothing to do.

206
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,780
How old do I look?

207
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,110
25.

208
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,110
Your greenhouse looks great.

209
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:53,010
Very nice whisky.
I drank something special.

210
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,840
I want to eat tomatoes.

211
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,230
Let's go pick some.

212
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,760
You want to?

213
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,500
Anywhere to lie down?

214
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,370
That feels good.

215
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,760
Super...

216
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,320
Super!

217
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,110
Come on my stomach.

218
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,850
Don't come in me.

219
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,960
I don't want a baby.

220
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,720
Young men are great.

221
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,670
Haven't done it in 2 years,
since I got divorced.

222
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,490
We'll meet here tomorrow?

223
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,180
I'll close early. OK?

224
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,870
I'll be waiting.

225
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,460
Co-op's here!

226
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,110
Mitsuo! Co-op's here!

227
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,360
Mitsuo!

228
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,620
Co-op's here!

229
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,540
Here's the receipt.

230
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,400
Tomato price went up.

231
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,730
You can't sleep now.

232
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,020
Too much hormone last year,
the tomatoes had no seeds.

233
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,590
Grow them well this year.

234
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,510
This is not for fun.

235
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,430
I know that!

236
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,280
These few days are
the most important. Bye.

237
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,900
No matter how many
tomatoes they buy.

238
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,110
Just a sheet of paper.
Won't show you the money.

239
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,390
Cunning merchants!

240
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,950
What the hell!

241
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,340
Who are you?

242
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,810
Who am I?

243
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,690
I'm her husband.

244
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,060
You looked after
my wife last night.

245
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,900
I came to thank you.

246
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,210
What do you mean?
What do you mean?!

247
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,900
She's divorced.
You're not her husband.

248
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,810
You're talking to him.

249
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,410
She loves saying
she's divorced.

250
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,230
She has a kid.

251
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,310
Does she look single to you?

252
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,430
She came home late
last night,

253
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,990
with hay in her hair.

254
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,430
She's sleeping now,
being tied up.

255
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,800
She looks so lovely.

256
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,700
She cried and apologized
till daybreak.

257
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,620
Must be tired.

258
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,620
What do you want?

259
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,520
Money?

260
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,080
Don't screw her again.

261
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,160
That's it.

262
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,490
A clean break.

263
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,360
If you bump into her,
pretend you don't know her.

264
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,730
What's your hobby?

265
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,530
Driving and fishing.

266
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,680
What's yours, Ayako?

267
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,530
Cooking.

268
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,280
Her stew's the best.
She went to cooking school.

269
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,260
She always helps me.
Right, honey?

270
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:32,590
I farm in a greenhouse.
It's now 0.2 hectares,

271
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:37,530
I plan to double the size.

272
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:45,140
I wonder if Ayako
is willing to do farm work.

273
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,970
She has to do it
if we get married.

274
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,330
Beautiful women don't
want such work.

275
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,240
Ayako, go help him.
Start tomorrow.

276
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,740
I don't want a tan.

277
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,040
Even if I wanted to,
I have a job.

278
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,470
Eat! Food's getting cold.

279
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,970
Your son's not working
at the construction site.

280
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,760
- It'd be good if he does.
- Oh well...

281
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:37,010
We don't talk much.
I learnt more about him today.

282
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,310
Young folks,
go for a drive. Ayako?

283
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,950
Let's be frank.

284
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,390
Stop doing what we
don't like to do.

285
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,210
Being a good boy makes
my shoulders stiff.

286
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,550
You were looking at me, right?

287
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,740
It's a blind date, isn't it?

288
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,670
But you were watching non-stop.

289
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,210
I thought you liked me.

290
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,450
I can work at your greenhouse.

291
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,740
I'm fed up with
the gas station.

292
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,280
Will you pay me?

293
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,360
Let's go to a motel.

294
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,660
No! That's ridiculous!

295
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,410
Let me out!

296
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,360
I haven't met such a guy!

297
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:52,330
I'll marry you! Promise!
Is that OK?

298
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,470
Is that a proposal?
What about my feelings?

299
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,940
Let's get married.
I want to.

300
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:05,610
You plan on divorcing me
when it turns out badly?

301
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,100
Too good for you!

302
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,720
You did play around?

303
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:15,200
I know.
Because I did.

304
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:51,780
Now that we're here.
Don't sulk. I won't.

305
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,370
Just come in.

306
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,880
- We'll just talk?
- Yes.

307
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,870
Don't fool around.

308
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,870
You did.

309
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,220
You really want to get married?

310
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,590
Yes. For the 100th time.

311
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:19,130
<i>Short stay or long?</i>

312
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:22,150
Short. 2 hours.

313
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,730
Nothing more to say.

314
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,080
Just one thing to do.

315
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,010
You do this often?

316
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,290
You planned this?

317
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,390
This is the first time.

318
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:46,140
That's OK, if you
want to lie about this.

319
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,910
Might be more fun
if we're both free.

320
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,480
So... what do you want?

321
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,960
Nothing.

322
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,580
Do you get it?

323
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,430
I think it's time
to get married.

324
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,390
My parents are impatient.

325
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,020
I've been on 8 blind dates.

326
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,040
It's so tiring to make
yourself look impressive.

327
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,260
Someone like you
is good enough.

328
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,590
Wait.

329
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,890
You'll wrinkle my dress.

330
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,790
Smooth.

331
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,790
What?

332
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,930
Gorgeous body.

333
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,910
Let's say this first.

334
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,600
You're my 5th man.

335
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,190
Why didn't you shave?

336
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:42,840
Don't want to look
so good on blind dates.

337
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,690
So you weren't serious?

338
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,200
Were you?

339
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,800
You looked better
with a beard.

340
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,400
Wish I could do this every day.

341
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:15,310
You can, if we get married.

342
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:18,400
No, before that.

343
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:47,020
One more time?

344
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,590
Too much hard work
will ruin your body.

345
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,520
You may get night-blind.

346
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,810
Don't pretend
you're hardworking!

347
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,180
It's too early to decide.

348
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,110
There'll be someone else.

349
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,810
You're doing fine.

350
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,290
You're getting married.

351
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:44,090
I want to get married too.
Show me your girl.

352
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:49,210
Well... She's not
really good-looking.

353
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:55,780
I know who she is.
She's Hanamura's daughter.

354
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,060
Brings back memories.
You used to come every evening.

355
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:08,520
Thanks to you he's
now a fine young man.

356
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,910
He was so skinny,
and you made him eat!

357
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,340
But you've only seen her once?

358
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,980
And you made up your mind?

359
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:27,260
She's homely and not delicate.
I can make her work.

360
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,420
"Wives are hornless cattle."

361
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,280
Even when they're pregnant,
we work them hard.

362
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:40,830
You can talk all night.

363
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,640
She's like me.

364
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:47,830
She can drive
and go anywhere.

365
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,510
She's a good one.

366
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,730
Dad ignores me.

367
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,530
He won't come over
when I get married.

368
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:03,650
But there'd be
a wedding ceremony.

369
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,020
He won't embarrass his heir.

370
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:14,600
In the end, he'll come.

371
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,350
Wada speaking.

372
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,330
<i>It's been a while, Mitsuo.</i>

373
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,630
You in Tokyo?

374
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,390
<i>At home. Saitama.</i>

375
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,790
<i>In crampy public housing.
Can you hear the TV?</i>

376
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,360
Money?

377
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,640
<i>There's a good house for sale.</i>

378
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,840
<i>Every salaryman's dream.</i>

379
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,560
<i>You won't understand.
You only inherited your place.</i>

380
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,540
Tie a string through it,
you can catch a carp.

381
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,230
With this, it's easy.

382
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,270
- Really?
- Yes.

383
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,750
I'll get some worms.

384
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:20,600
Let's go to your dad's.

385
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,350
His carp dishes are yummy.

386
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,350
Don't wanna see him.

387
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,560
No! We'll have lots of fun.

388
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:12,250
Hey! Is that a bomb?

389
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,020
It's locked!
Go in from side door.

390
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,010
Why are you here?

391
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,250
I took Koji to
see how you're doing.

392
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,780
Long time no see.
How are you?

393
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:57,560
So so. I don't work
as hard as you do.

394
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:08,370
Dad, sashimi this.
We'll drink.

395
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:10,040
No knife.

396
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,660
Get some beer.

397
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,070
I'm your kid.

398
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:20,200
You're nasty!

399
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,360
You're my father.
Let's take our time and talk,

400
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,380
while we eat this.

401
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,330
I'm leaving.

402
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:36,750
Take my carp. Enjoy.

403
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,720
It's your family time. Bye.

404
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,770
Business is bad.

405
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,070
I closed the snack bar.

406
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,370
Sold it to a real estate agent.

407
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:08,370
You still have money
on your account?

408
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:14,460
Tetsuo wants 3 million.

409
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,770
It's his right
as the eldest son.

410
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,770
How about me?

411
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,280
You came for money?

412
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:37,790
Come home.
Tomatoes are doing well.

413
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,580
Give me a hand.

414
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,410
Don't go.
I won't give him up.

415
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,890
Shop's gone.
I can't do without him.

416
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,380
I can go back
and work in a bar.

417
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,480
I'll look after him!

418
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,780
We stay as one.

419
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,170
Mitsuo!

420
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,480
Mitsuo!

421
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,120
You said you needed help,

422
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,470
now what are you doing?

423
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,080
Your day off?

424
00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:00,100
Dad wants to fix the date and
the witness for the ceremony.

425
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,490
Trouble!

426
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,380
We have to talk with his dad.

427
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,630
It's OK if he doesn't come,
but it's better if he does.

428
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:14,690
It's better if he doesn't.

429
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:21,930
Lend me some work clothes.
I want to work with you.

430
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:24,840
All right!
How about my jeans?

431
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,890
Wear my baggy pants.

432
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,530
His jeans will do.
Never wore baggy pants.

433
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:45,800
You ignore the old,
and eat by yourselves.

434
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,270
When Matsuzo's gone,
you treat me badly.

435
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,810
You don't give me food
because my hearing's bad!

436
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,330
Please eat.
It's all yours.

437
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:19,590
Take those that are
20 or 30% red.

438
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,300
Those that look like
what you see in stores,

439
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,300
like they're ready to eat,

440
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,500
discard them.

441
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:31,180
Hey. I haven't done this before.

442
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,540
It's easy!

443
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:36,070
Put it in.

444
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,820
And cut. You try.

445
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,350
Not like this.
Like that.

446
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,930
How about this?

447
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:41,710
Too ripe. Discard.

448
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,420
I always looked forward
to visiting my folks back home,

449
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:08,130
because I could sleep
all I wanted.

450
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,050
My mom cried so hard,

451
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:12,780
"You must have
a hard time there!"

452
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:16,310
When it was time to leave,

453
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,540
she gave me money,
though a small amount.

454
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:21,630
The money wasn't
with me for long.

455
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:25,730
I spent it all on
things for my kids.

456
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:32,590
In Tomiko's time,
she had it much easier.

457
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:36,820
We did a great job, Ayako.

458
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,150
It's very good.

459
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:51,200
It's too oily for
an old person.

460
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,330
When I came to this family,

461
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:27,090
if I ever left a grain of rice,
I'd be in a lot of trouble.

462
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:30,810
"One grain of rice on earth
is one barrel in heaven!"

463
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:34,550
She picked it up carefully,

464
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,920
said she'd dump
the rice pot in the river.

465
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:42,010
Actually she put the
rice grains in the pot,

466
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:45,790
called up all the other
mothers in the village,

467
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:48,650
"Look what my
daughter-in-law did!"

468
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,430
Want some coffee?

469
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:06,160
What's up with her?

470
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,770
I said, is something wrong?

471
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,780
Thanks for today.

472
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:26,850
Let's go to a cafe.

473
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:28,920
It's late. I'm going home.

474
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:30,450
What?

475
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,540
You're angry?

476
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,440
I'll be frank.

477
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:51,810
After I saw them,
I lost all confidence.

478
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:54,220
We'll move out.

479
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:57,090
I'm not the only woman.

480
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:26,080
Oh!
Long time no see.

481
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,650
I saw a new car at your place.
She came?

482
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,710
She just left.

483
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,650
Angry.

484
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,780
We're not made for each other.

485
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,700
I'm ready to dress up.
When's the ceremony?

486
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:46,450
Congrats.

487
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:58,750
You're still here.

488
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,620
Your husband made a big fuss.

489
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,450
What about?

490
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,580
Alright.

491
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:11,800
Kaede told me what
happened between you two.

492
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:15,550
I never thought of it.

493
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,860
Now you call her by name?

494
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:25,600
If you touch her now,
I won't forgive you.

495
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:31,920
You're like your dad.
I have to be careful.

496
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:35,010
Dad...

497
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:41,260
You got her drunk, then dragged
her to the greenhouse.

498
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,020
That's low.

499
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:47,900
You're lucky that
she hasn't gone to the police.

500
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:57,260
Recently we spent
a night at hot springs.

501
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,630
Last Saturday. Yes?

502
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,760
You meant nothing to me.

503
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,380
Hey!

504
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,550
My bottle...
I'm taking it.

505
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:03,300
60 yen per kilo!
Do I work for free?

506
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,210
How about
fertilizers and pesticide?

507
00:57:05,370 --> 00:57:07,600
Hey stop that!
I can't help it!

508
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:10,040
This year's warm.

509
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:13,370
The produce is out
earlier than usual.

510
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:17,180
"Switch on the boiler
when it's cold."

511
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:20,520
"Careful, it'll get
very warm this month."

512
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:24,010
Bastard! That's what
I get in return!

513
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,740
Don't give up.

514
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,800
Mom!
It's so cheap!

515
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:40,140
We worked for nothing!

516
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:44,020
Don't get mad about that!

517
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:49,880
Farmers move their bodies
and turn the soil around.

518
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,940
But I'm so angry!

519
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:59,230
No matter how cheap,
we'll get money from the co-op.

520
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,910
Farmers work,
and then they eat.

521
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,080
Alright! Let's work!

522
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:17,230
Mitsuo!

523
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,740
Come help me.

524
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,490
I'm very busy.

525
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:30,500
You promised.
I helped you.

526
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,720
Kaede came.

527
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:39,290
She's so excited.

528
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:44,060
She wants to see you.

529
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:49,040
Mom!

530
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,600
I'm going to help Koji.

531
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:12,390
If I don't work,
I won't be happy.

532
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:14,890
You look great.

533
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:20,030
The smell of soil makes
farmers feel great.

534
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:25,610
Smelling burnt garbage
at the incinerator every day.

535
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,990
Sweating makes my
pores breathe.

536
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,970
This is a 0.4-hectare field?

537
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:35,550
Why don't you fill this up
and build a greenhouse?

538
00:59:46,570 --> 00:59:49,500
- Hi!
- The tomato man!

539
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:51,500
You came today?

540
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:15,890
Machiko,

541
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,840
if you don't study hard,

542
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:23,100
you'll end up working like that.
You don't like it, do you?

543
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:24,970
Shut up!

544
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:33,310
Eh?

545
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:38,390
He's dead.
What is there to do?

546
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:47,840
He's dead.

547
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:01,960
He's not for you.
Here's a good guy.

548
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,190
You put that stone at my place?

549
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:08,210
They were shocked that
the earth god walks!

550
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:12,010
How about tonight?

551
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:14,610
No straws.

552
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:37,460
Mitsuo. Tomatoes are
dirt cheap now.

553
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:43,160
You worked so hard.
You must feel very bad.

554
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,030
Heat up the bath water.

555
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,090
- Go!
- Have some.

556
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:01,200
What's up?

557
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,180
What's wrong with your
dad coming home?

558
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:07,820
That woman?

559
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,530
We broke up.

560
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,320
Water's not ready!

561
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:48,540
Now it's your chance.

562
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:52,220
You can't get ahead if no one
knows you in this village.

563
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:54,630
Oh yes!

564
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:57,350
Ask Mr Utsuka to be
the wedding witness.

565
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:02,470
If you have a rich
guy to do this,

566
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,730
you'll have face
in the village.

567
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:07,830
This is no longer a village.

568
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:09,410
It is.

569
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:15,540
People come and help out
on weddings and funerals.

570
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,280
This is a village.

571
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:21,820
Mitsuo, drink.
Your dad's come home.

572
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,750
You're broke,
so you came back for money?

573
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,140
I have lots of money!

574
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:31,130
Millions of it.

575
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:33,450
Good evening.

576
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:36,640
Come in.

577
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:40,460
Uncle, so you're back!

578
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,200
We just said it's time
for you to come on stage.

579
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:47,040
So you've been expecting me?

580
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:50,100
And you have a new car!

581
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:56,570
Mitsuo, let's go for a drink.
My treat.

582
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:01,410
I'll... be working
at the greenhouse.

583
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:05,670
Go and have a drink.
You have to relax.

584
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,540
Go have fun with Koji.

585
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:12,500
I... want to work.

586
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:14,300
Sorry.

587
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:28,650
Wow, so clean.

588
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,370
You OK?

589
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:34,020
You asked me to come.

590
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:36,660
Is Koji angry?

591
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:42,630
Have you brought a towel?

592
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:52,150
What a nerve!
What if her husband is home?

593
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:57,660
I can't find her!

594
01:05:57,890 --> 01:06:00,810
If I could see her,
I'd be OK.

595
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:04,560
Perhaps she's drinking?
Go look.

596
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:06,660
Don't hold up the line.

597
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:10,080
I know!
Now I'm not in the mood.

598
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:18,260
Hey you...

599
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,040
What do you think of Koji?

600
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:24,660
He wants to get married.

601
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,640
- With whom?
- With you.

602
01:06:30,260 --> 01:06:31,960
Glad to hear that.

603
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:52,470
Mitsuo!

604
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,200
What's this?

605
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,150
I warned you!

606
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:04,160
What's wrong with that?
She just ignores her husband.

607
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:06,670
Aren't you too serious?

608
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,100
Stop this!

609
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:25,240
Your date won't let you?

610
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:30,160
Once you get married,
you can do it whenever you want.

611
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:34,710
She asked me to come.

612
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:40,470
Lie!
It's a lie!

613
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:47,680
She said she was getting
a divorce, and asked me out.

614
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:52,170
Would I force her?
It's a lie!

615
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:57,580
Don't be serious with her.

616
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,980
But she's good to play with.

617
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:07,880
Your friend asked me to come.

618
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:12,470
"Don't go with him. Take me."
He said that. It's true!

619
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,260
It's true!

620
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:18,450
So you'd go with
anyone who asks you?

621
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:21,760
And spread your legs for him?

622
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:25,250
Stop it!
You'll leave a bruise!

623
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:27,390
What should I tell my husband?

624
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:32,800
If you have a husband
then why make a fool of me?

625
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,550
<i>It hurts!</i>

626
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:45,730
I called and called!
I even looked for you!

627
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,650
- Don't you know!
- It hurts!

628
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,370
Thank you! Come again!

629
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,250
Welcome! Fill it up?

630
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,690
Fill it up.

631
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:22,490
Fill it up.

632
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,800
Have you eaten?

633
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:44,950
4 liters. That's 620 yen.

634
01:09:45,780 --> 01:09:49,680
It's your lunch break?
My treat.

635
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:55,600
You had a perm.
A blind date?

636
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:59,170
What's wrong with your eye?

637
01:09:59,710 --> 01:10:01,700
Cut the crap.

638
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:04,900
I haven't got over you.
So are you.

639
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,100
We can't end it like this.

640
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,780
I want the best steak.
I helped at the greenhouse.

641
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,700
I've made up my mind.

642
01:10:21,950 --> 01:10:24,110
You're the best.

643
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:27,080
I told my friends about you.

644
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:30,710
I'll be embarrassed
if I lose you.

645
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:33,570
We'll move out.
That's the bottom-line.

646
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,910
I'll have the 1st floor rebuilt.

647
01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:37,810
A new bathroom,
kitchen, and toilet.

648
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:42,520
A new iron staircase
outside the house.

649
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:46,490
No kids for 5 years.

650
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:50,200
I want to have fun too.

651
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,050
Here's your order.

652
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:03,270
So is that a deal?
Shall we get married?

653
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:08,610
They know we went to
a motel after our date.

654
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:14,020
Mom noticed I took a bath,
and asked me about it.

655
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:17,020
She said,
"If you get married, then OK."

656
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,520
Let's...

657
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,120
Go there?

658
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:28,130
Do you feel safe?

659
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,520
I haven't said yes for sure.

660
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:35,160
This is for life.

661
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,520
So noisy! Elections.

662
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:41,520
Ouch!

663
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:46,190
<i>Please vote for Hiroshi Utsuka.</i>

664
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:23,910
It's done.

665
01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:29,320
I want to see
if this will fit him.

666
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:31,830
If not, I'll redo it.

667
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:36,730
Do you know the campaign office?

668
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:40,880
He's there.
My mom's there too.

669
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:43,930
What do you want?

670
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:51,920
I'm not him!
You'll have to redo it.

671
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,800
I went there 3 to 4 times.

672
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:06,570
When I saw your house,
I couldn't go any further.

673
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:11,730
I don't mind if you
throw stones at me.

674
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:16,550
But... he...

675
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:24,140
You love him that much?

676
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:27,370
What a waste!

677
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:30,540
He said he'd come back
after the elections.

678
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:36,000
"If I don't, then drag me
back like a dog."

679
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:40,540
Do that.

680
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:47,540
You can have this, Mitsuo.

681
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:08,290
Granny, you'll fall.

682
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:15,300
My daughter-in-law
is starving me!

683
01:14:15,630 --> 01:14:17,480
Where's my food?

684
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:22,550
Where did she put it?

685
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:25,950
Wait. I'll make you something.

686
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:33,950
I've gone soft,
and she's like that now.

687
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:38,950
Shouldn't give her my wallet.

688
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:58,260
Hello.

689
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:02,990
<i>Hey dear. I just quit
my gas station job.</i>

690
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:07,120
You made up your mind?
You'll marry me?

691
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:09,850
<i>My friends congratulated me.</i>

692
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:14,960
<i>From a blind date straight
to a motel. They love the story.</i>

693
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:17,750
<i>You're a hero.</i>

694
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,510
Are your friends men?

695
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:27,890
<i>Relax. Just 4 beauties here,
including myself.</i>

696
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:31,590
<i>They want to meet you.</i>

697
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:34,760
<i>Can you come now?</i>

698
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,730
OK. Wait for me.

699
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:38,280
<i>Really?</i>

700
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,660
It's dangerous!

701
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:08,650
Mitsuo!

702
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,960
Mitsuo! Koji's done
something bad.

703
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:13,700
Please come over.

704
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,970
Koji took his wife away.

705
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,870
I came home from work
but my wife wasn't there.

706
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:45,090
The kid's watching TV.
I asked her, she said,

707
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:48,740
"That farmer came
and took Mom away."

708
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:51,360
Any evidence it's Koji?

709
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:55,550
If not you, then who else?

710
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:59,180
Your wife asks this
and that guy out.

711
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:01,970
I, for one, am her victim.

712
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:07,190
Mitsuo. Please, come with
us and look for Koji.

713
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:11,100
If the police's involved,
he'll be in trouble.

714
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:13,910
No big deal.

715
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:17,400
Look at him. He's so calm.

716
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:23,110
Koji took out a million yen
from our co-op account.

717
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:26,580
You just let him
take a million?

718
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:30,470
He said he's the eldest son,
he wants his own business.

719
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:32,930
But a million!
He can go overseas!

720
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:35,300
I'm out of here!

721
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:40,090
Please watch her for me.

722
01:17:56,410 --> 01:17:58,170
When I proposed to her,

723
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:05,110
she agreed on condition that
she could play around.

724
01:18:06,210 --> 01:18:11,530
She's a beauty,
and I'm ugly.

725
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:16,140
I was glad that I could pick
the impossible flower.

726
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:23,270
I let her have fun as promised.

727
01:18:32,230 --> 01:18:34,740
I was so embarrassed!

728
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,880
At least you could have called.

729
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:43,270
We waited for you for 3 hours,
the one I'm so proud of.

730
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,810
I can't bear seeing them.

731
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,670
You're proud of me?

732
01:18:52,420 --> 01:18:53,640
Idiot!

733
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:55,780
It hurts!

734
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:58,710
My friend...

735
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:02,180
ran off with someone's wife.

736
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:05,450
We looked for them whole night.

737
01:19:07,150 --> 01:19:09,340
He took a million with him.

738
01:19:10,290 --> 01:19:12,750
When the money's gone,
he'll be back for sure.

739
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,750
A false alarm really.

740
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:22,770
Playing around is all right,
but do it in style.

741
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:25,520
Wanna play?

742
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:30,080
<i>Mitsuo Wada,
thanks for your hard work.</i>

743
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:37,280
<i>Hiroshi Utsuka is here
to greet you workers.</i>

744
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:44,450
<i>Hiroshi Ut... Hiroshi Utsuka...
needs your vote.</i>

745
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:50,380
<i>Hiroshi Ur... Hiroshi Utsuka...
please vote for him.</i>

746
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:56,860
Hello there.

747
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:01,730
I'm Utsuka. Thank you!

748
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:10,880
Thank you! Thank you!

749
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:21,230
Work hard!

750
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:32,830
Looks refreshing.

751
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,870
You take one too.

752
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:37,290
Yes!

753
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:03,360
Don't stare at me like that.
I feel shy.

754
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:13,490
It's cold!

755
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:21,090
It's cold! Stop it!

756
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,650
Do you like farm work?

757
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:57,440
There's no other choice.

758
01:21:57,730 --> 01:22:03,690
Dad supplements my income
no matter what job I take.

759
01:22:04,580 --> 01:22:06,790
I've got you, that's enough.

760
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,360
Just sweet talk.

761
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:19,700
A bed and a gas stove.
That's enough as a home for me.

762
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:23,690
I want to do something big.

763
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:26,690
Once a woman has kids,
her life's finished.

764
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:28,700
Look at my mom.

765
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:34,960
Just the two of us would be happy.
Everyone'd be happy.

766
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:38,690
My friends will envy us.

767
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:43,220
That'll be the best thing.

768
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:46,610
Let's go to Hawaii
for our honeymoon.

769
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:49,740
Or go shopping in Hong Kong.

770
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:52,040
I'll ask my dad for money.

771
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:55,910
OK. Let's go there.

772
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:19,340
Tomatoes! Very cheap!

773
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:24,100
Just 100 yen per bag!
Very nice tomatoes!

774
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:26,610
Cheap tomatoes!

775
01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:32,770
100 yen per bag!
Very nice tomatoes!

776
01:23:41,470 --> 01:23:46,880
During cold nights we turn on
the stove to keep them warm.

777
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:49,250
The fruit of sweat and tears!

778
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:53,590
They're so cheap,
we just eat shit!

779
01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:57,510
Freshly picked tomatoes!

780
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:04,000
Take out your 50 yen coins!

781
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:09,170
- Just 50 yen for them.
- No way!

782
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:11,390
They're red, like a baby!

783
01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:15,410
Much better than those in
supermarkets. 100 yen for you.

784
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:19,120
The money's for dating?
Here's my contribution.

785
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:22,420
Line up!

786
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:26,130
Where did you find such
a good girl? Tomato field?

787
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:36,900
<i>Today's June 14th. Election Day.
You may vote at...</i>

788
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,520
It's good on you.

789
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:59,080
Like kid's underwear.

790
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:02,460
It's cute... and sexy.

791
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:06,670
That's what I want.
A cool look.

792
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,510
I feel hot just by looking.

793
01:25:11,810 --> 01:25:13,810
It's good on young folks.

794
01:25:16,990 --> 01:25:19,420
We'll pay with these.
Count them.

795
01:25:19,940 --> 01:25:21,730
Please put this in a bag.

796
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:26,090
We'll go eat,
then see a movie.

797
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:28,730
I don't wanna eat.
I feel sick.

798
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:30,690
Oh really?

799
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:33,010
Motel?

800
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:35,310
Horny stud!

801
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:46,840
Bastard!

802
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:52,000
Bastard!

803
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:54,630
Bastard!!

804
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:36,140
It's cold! Bastard! Idiot!

805
01:26:52,770 --> 01:26:56,180
- Mitsuo Wada?
- Yes.

806
01:26:56,650 --> 01:26:58,930
Koji Nakamori's friend?

807
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:01,220
Yes.

808
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:05,840
A missing person report was made.
Don't you know?

809
01:27:06,830 --> 01:27:10,480
The man and the woman
don't need interference.

810
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,980
They like each other.
It's not a kidnapping.

811
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:17,150
That's a boorish guy.

812
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:18,890
You're his buddy, right?

813
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:23,060
They hired an investigator.
Are you looking for him?

814
01:27:23,670 --> 01:27:27,450
I'm not going to.
Think he's OK.

815
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,860
There are few men here
during the day.

816
01:27:31,530 --> 01:27:34,450
You noticed anything strange?

817
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:38,610
I'm getting married.
I'm not like him.

818
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,650
Don't worry.

819
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:47,850
I'm going on a trip.

820
01:27:48,150 --> 01:27:49,950
For good?

821
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:27,300
Stop it!

822
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:33,650
<i>Mitsuo. Visitors.</i>

823
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:40,660
Mr. Matsuzo Wada?

824
01:28:40,930 --> 01:28:43,410
My dad's in jail.

825
01:28:43,730 --> 01:28:45,660
So he's out?

826
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:48,980
Then we'll talk with his son.

827
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:52,350
I'm busy.
What are you selling?

828
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:56,860
It's the other way round.
The land of your greenhouse.

829
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:58,910
Will you sell it?

830
01:28:59,050 --> 01:29:02,500
We want to set up
a used-car shop there.

831
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:04,700
We'll pay you well.

832
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:08,170
Get out!

833
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,860
- A good price...
- Out!

834
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:12,660
Go!

835
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:20,570
What's wrong?

836
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:22,300
Mitsuo.

837
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:27,820
I must congratulate you now.

838
01:30:00,070 --> 01:30:03,200
So full inside,
I just feel like throwing up.

839
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:23,570
Sorry.

840
01:30:24,510 --> 01:30:27,040
What for?

841
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:32,000
I think we'll be happier
just by ourselves.

842
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:39,200
I know you want to
have fun on our honeymoon.

843
01:30:41,110 --> 01:30:42,950
I'll get rid of it.

844
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:46,930
What about the wedding?

845
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:50,990
Trouble.

846
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:55,050
So we'll have a kid?

847
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:05,510
It's OK to have it?

848
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:11,510
You're really a nice guy.

849
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:22,830
Matsuzo Wada...

850
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:26,840
Just some simple questions
and we've let him go.

851
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,750
Nothing serious really.

852
01:31:29,070 --> 01:31:30,850
Isn't he home yet?

853
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:33,310
Thanks.

854
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:52,140
Come in.

855
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:55,360
You got something to say?
Say it quick.

856
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,500
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

857
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:02,930
What's wrong with this?

858
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:07,420
Yes, I'm useless... so?

859
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:14,830
Mitsuo. Can you
give me some money?

860
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:17,520
1,000 or 2,000 will do.

861
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,990
Be a good son.

862
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:28,830
I dropped this in the ditch.

863
01:33:02,940 --> 01:33:04,530
Uncle!

864
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:11,680
Tetsuo.
Do me a favour.

865
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:15,530
Please be the wedding witness.

866
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:17,990
- The wedding witness?
- Yes.

867
01:33:19,070 --> 01:33:22,830
Your brother as the best man?
That's unheard of! Right?

868
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:28,310
Right. That'd be strange.
Don't.

869
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:31,540
Just sit and face
me for a while.

870
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:34,300
Then the party will begin.

871
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:44,740
You want 3 million?

872
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:48,460
Hitomi. Kazu. Come.
Let's play.

873
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:54,740
We don't have that much.
Let's go and ask dad.

874
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:02,540
Is Dad... really living
with a bar hostess?

875
01:34:05,850 --> 01:34:08,240
Mom! Why did you keep silent?

876
01:34:08,690 --> 01:34:11,140
That's all I can do.

877
01:34:12,950 --> 01:34:16,350
We're not kids.
I can't force him.

878
01:34:17,370 --> 01:34:20,160
If I were you, I'd just
tie him up and drag him back.

879
01:34:20,380 --> 01:34:22,160
That simple.

880
01:34:22,750 --> 01:34:24,710
That's the way to go about it.

881
01:34:28,110 --> 01:34:31,720
Let's go together.
Do what you like.

882
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:34,760
You coming?

883
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:37,550
OK.

884
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,550
We'll back you up.
Do what you like.

885
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:50,940
You'll wait here?

886
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,970
Let's go.
I'm here now.

887
01:35:24,810 --> 01:35:27,440
That's not what you told me.

888
01:35:27,830 --> 01:35:29,420
They fled.

889
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:40,760
How about my 3 million?

890
01:35:40,850 --> 01:35:43,580
You sure this is the right place?

891
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:50,330
Firefly!

892
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:53,170
There too!

893
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:56,220
Pretty!

894
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:06,080
Over there as well.

895
01:36:25,350 --> 01:36:27,760
You're not alone!

896
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:10,560
Baby's still not moving?

897
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:14,660
Fool.

898
01:37:15,690 --> 01:37:19,250
Wait until my belly's as
big as a sumo wrestler's.

899
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:43,940
Those kids...

900
01:37:45,070 --> 01:37:47,570
They thought fireflies were hot.

901
01:37:56,670 --> 01:37:58,840
And can't be touched.

902
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:08,150
They screamed when fireflies
gathered around their mom's head.

903
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:11,770
We're just...

904
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:15,130
Country bumpkins.

905
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:19,120
We are.

906
01:38:19,890 --> 01:38:21,840
I know, but...

907
01:38:30,660 --> 01:38:34,460
The wedding... will go well.

908
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:40,770
I'm looking forward to it.

909
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:43,970
Want to take their breath away.

910
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:24,630
You must feel hot in that dress.

911
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:28,370
Say it if you can't
stand it anymore.

912
01:41:29,390 --> 01:41:30,780
I'm OK.

913
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:34,780
It's my most beautiful moment.

914
01:41:40,310 --> 01:41:41,980
Wipe it.

915
01:41:56,940 --> 01:41:58,610
Mitsuo.

916
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:01,900
Hanamura!
Congratulations!

917
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:13,620
Now it's just you and me.

918
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:16,990
You better drink up!

919
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:23,550
What a wedding feast!
Very luxurious!

920
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:27,830
I can't thank you enough.

921
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:32,300
Don't! Now we're relatives.

922
01:42:33,510 --> 01:42:35,310
We are as one.

923
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:27,030
Never seen such a big feast.

924
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:29,800
Did it cost a lot?

925
01:43:29,930 --> 01:43:31,960
At least 3 million?

926
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:34,800
Less than a million.

927
01:43:35,110 --> 01:43:38,880
With the gifts,
I'll make a profit.

928
01:43:40,050 --> 01:43:41,500
Profit!

929
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:55,780
Wait!

930
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:59,300
You did it!

931
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:01,460
Who do you want?
Me or her?

932
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:05,310
Congratulations.
You did great.

933
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:39,920
That's OK! Never mind!

934
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:49,090
Eat or you'll be very hungry.

935
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,270
This will go on all night.

936
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:26,560
"In heaven,
where the sun rises..."

937
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:42,330
Granny. Go watch TV.

938
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:45,010
Why are there so many people?

939
01:45:53,470 --> 01:45:56,130
It's my wedding.

940
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:58,790
I invited them.

941
01:45:59,050 --> 01:46:03,420
I thought Mitsuo's still a kid.

942
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:07,910
He's getting married?

943
01:46:08,490 --> 01:46:10,610
Where's the girl from?

944
01:46:15,260 --> 01:46:19,170
Everybody. Drink! Sake!

945
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:40,740
Granny, wait here.

946
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:43,020
I'll bring you some food.

947
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:49,330
<i>Phone call.</i>

948
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:52,430
- Phone call for Mitsuo!
- Coming!

949
01:46:56,870 --> 01:46:58,320
Hello.

950
01:47:00,890 --> 01:47:04,170
Where are you?
We're so worried.

951
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:08,720
It's my wedding.

952
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:14,620
They all say I've got
myself a good bride.

953
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,820
What about that woman?

954
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:25,130
What?

955
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:27,620
What did you do?

956
01:47:28,910 --> 01:47:32,660
- Mitsuo, come drink.
- Coming.

957
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:36,420
What happened?

958
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:42,660
I'm coming. Don't go away.

959
01:48:28,830 --> 01:48:30,830
Traditional clothes?

960
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:34,330
You look great in them.

961
01:48:35,990 --> 01:48:40,730
Is it alright for you
to leave the banquet?

962
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:48,550
Where's the woman?

963
01:48:53,480 --> 01:48:55,240
I killed her.

964
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:58,640
I strangled her.

965
01:49:00,190 --> 01:49:03,960
She died so quickly that
I didn't feel a thing.

966
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:11,740
She just fainted?

967
01:49:13,330 --> 01:49:15,130
You think I'm joking?

968
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:20,440
Of course. It's a joke.

969
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:24,780
I'm a murderer. Really.

970
01:49:27,570 --> 01:49:29,310
She's a slut.

971
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:39,470
Where's she?

972
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:45,910
Snack bar.

973
01:49:46,950 --> 01:49:50,060
Let's go to a snack
bar and drink.

974
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:06,640
Stop here!

975
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:09,890
It should be here.

976
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:21,610
Sorry. It's not here.

977
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:23,930
Further up.

978
01:50:56,150 --> 01:50:58,710
Now I remember. Here!

979
01:50:59,300 --> 01:51:00,520
It's here!

980
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,600
Koji! Koji!

981
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:53,650
You're all wet!

982
01:51:54,530 --> 01:51:57,140
A walk in the rain.
Sorry.

983
01:51:57,590 --> 01:52:03,360
You'll get a baby tonight.
It's like that in our house.

984
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:07,390
You did something good?

985
01:52:08,410 --> 01:52:12,780
- Jealous?
- You young people.

986
01:52:56,130 --> 01:52:57,580
Koji.

987
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:41,340
We went to the sea.

988
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:46,790
The sun was shining
on fish boats.

989
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,860
Woman's smooth skin
that makes you want to touch.

990
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:55,860
No matter how nice the view.

991
01:53:56,840 --> 01:54:00,530
No matter where we went,
we did the same thing.

992
01:54:02,700 --> 01:54:06,050
We walked around naked
in our room.

993
01:54:07,560 --> 01:54:11,120
When hungry,
we went out to eat.

994
01:54:13,710 --> 01:54:16,710
Gradually, it became less fun.

995
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:22,250
And frightening.

996
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:27,870
Kaede felt the same.

997
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:33,340
"I can't go back to him.
What will I do?"

998
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:35,160
She kept saying that.

999
01:54:37,170 --> 01:54:39,800
Her uncle is a chief of police.

1000
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:42,890
So she had to say
she was abducted.

1001
01:54:44,170 --> 01:54:46,810
When we passed by
the police box,

1002
01:54:46,910 --> 01:54:48,800
she yelled to let her out.

1003
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:52,040
I stopped.

1004
01:54:54,390 --> 01:54:56,790
Then she became quiet.

1005
01:54:58,460 --> 01:55:02,090
"Actually I love you."

1006
01:55:03,150 --> 01:55:06,580
"Let's go to a place where no
one knows us and settle down."

1007
01:55:09,080 --> 01:55:11,580
At the next police box,

1008
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:15,560
she thought of her child
and wept.

1009
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:19,530
I felt very strange.

1010
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:26,240
I got desperate and
bought a kitchen knife.

1011
01:55:27,910 --> 01:55:30,950
I gave it to her,
telling her to stab me anytime.

1012
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:35,960
She sat beside me
when I drove.

1013
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:42,040
She spread make-up cream on the
kitchen knife and enjoyed it.

1014
01:55:43,370 --> 01:55:46,260
And used it to
scratch my neck.

1015
01:55:47,770 --> 01:55:49,640
It was scary!

1016
01:55:50,150 --> 01:55:52,070
My cheeks were all wet.

1017
01:55:55,090 --> 01:55:57,430
I stopped at red lights.

1018
01:55:58,510 --> 01:56:00,890
I made a turn if I had to.

1019
01:56:02,950 --> 01:56:08,430
When I read the signs,
I saw places I knew.

1020
01:56:11,290 --> 01:56:17,260
I drove past my fields,
pretending I didn't know them.

1021
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:21,930
Although I ignored them,

1022
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:24,900
the rice still grows.

1023
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:28,230
My eyes fill with tears
when I think about it.

1024
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:42,450
At last, we went to a motel.

1025
01:56:44,090 --> 01:56:46,690
There's only one thing to do.

1026
01:56:49,330 --> 01:56:51,830
I expected to get
stabbed at daytime.

1027
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:57,520
But she felt settled
once she got naked.

1028
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:03,250
There were 2 cup-noodles
on top of the fridge.

1029
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:06,490
There was hot water
in the thermos.

1030
01:57:08,250 --> 01:57:11,990
"We'll go to the police tomorrow
when we're out of money."

1031
01:57:12,490 --> 01:57:14,700
We decided to do that.

1032
01:57:16,100 --> 01:57:18,350
Once we made a decision,
it was a relief.

1033
01:57:20,100 --> 01:57:22,220
We bathed together.

1034
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:24,920
Then we played in bed.

1035
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:29,230
Then she started to talk.

1036
01:57:32,110 --> 01:57:35,790
"I have an ordinary family,
but without worries.

1037
01:57:37,720 --> 01:57:40,880
"How come I'm like
a cheap whore?"

1038
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:45,700
She refused to
take responsibility.

1039
01:57:48,110 --> 01:57:50,030
I was exhausted.

1040
01:57:52,730 --> 01:57:54,940
I told her she's
responsible too.

1041
01:57:55,970 --> 01:57:58,030
"Die," I said to her.

1042
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:03,310
"That's the graceful way out."

1043
01:58:05,010 --> 01:58:07,690
She sat up on bed.

1044
01:58:09,740 --> 01:58:11,710
All naked.

1045
01:58:13,820 --> 01:58:17,710
Her pubes were touching
the bed sheet.

1046
01:58:20,830 --> 01:58:24,090
When we choked each other,

1047
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:28,960
unexpectedly,
she got very high.

1048
01:58:30,410 --> 01:58:32,230
She said,

1049
01:58:33,630 --> 01:58:36,360
"I'm sure I'm pregnant."

1050
01:58:38,150 --> 01:58:42,140
I said, "Does it matter now?"

1051
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:48,360
"You haven't been a parent,
that's why you say that."

1052
01:58:49,990 --> 01:58:54,750
"Devil! Bastard!
Such grand talk!" I retorted.

1053
01:58:57,630 --> 01:59:01,010
"You're a nuisance."

1054
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,850
"Die!" I sat on her chest.

1055
01:59:10,350 --> 01:59:11,890
While I was choking her,

1056
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:13,510
she...

1057
01:59:14,250 --> 01:59:17,860
closed her eyes
as if she was enjoying it.

1058
01:59:20,970 --> 01:59:22,660
Honestly...

1059
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:26,020
at that time...

1060
01:59:27,210 --> 01:59:30,760
I thought she was
so beautiful.

1061
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:37,440
I wanted to do her
as much as I could.

1062
01:59:40,710 --> 01:59:43,160
I should have stopped then!

1063
01:59:47,160 --> 01:59:51,100
I should have put less
force in my fingers.

1064
01:59:53,100 --> 01:59:54,660
The force...

1065
01:59:57,740 --> 02:00:01,500
Was just unexpected.

1066
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:06,210
Then, it was the end.

1067
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:13,990
She wasn't moving anymore.

1068
02:00:27,010 --> 02:00:29,670
With her...

1069
02:00:30,930 --> 02:00:33,670
the first two, three
days were fun.

1070
02:00:38,210 --> 02:00:41,570
That's how she felt too,
I suppose.

1071
02:00:45,350 --> 02:00:47,400
The only way out is...

1072
02:00:54,390 --> 02:00:56,870
to turn myself in.

1073
02:00:59,930 --> 02:01:01,870
Come with me.

1074
02:01:05,450 --> 02:01:07,350
We're friends.

1075
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,770
I'll do anything.

1076
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:15,680
Let's go.

1077
02:01:20,100 --> 02:01:23,480
Please help us at harvest time.

1078
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:50,470
Koji. Run away!

1079
02:01:52,810 --> 02:01:54,680
Take my car!

1080
02:01:56,420 --> 02:01:59,930
Tomorrow I'll take out
a million from my account.

1081
02:02:00,250 --> 02:02:03,140
You can live with that.

1082
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:07,080
You'd be implicated.

1083
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:10,190
You just got married!

1084
02:02:12,100 --> 02:02:13,780
Run away!

1085
02:02:15,550 --> 02:02:18,230
Hide in Tokyo!

1086
02:02:21,230 --> 02:02:24,480
If one million is not enough,
I'll give you five!

1087
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:32,500
I made up my mind.

1088
02:02:38,490 --> 02:02:40,070
Sorry.

1089
02:02:41,090 --> 02:02:42,990
To do this...

1090
02:02:44,640 --> 02:02:46,510
on such a night.

1091
02:02:51,380 --> 02:02:53,400
It's not dry yet.

1092
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:56,560
Take this.

1093
02:03:26,230 --> 02:03:27,840
Mitsuo.

1094
02:03:29,230 --> 02:03:31,400
The whole village is back.

1095
02:03:35,230 --> 02:03:39,120
When you came
and beat me up,

1096
02:03:40,930 --> 02:03:43,830
if she hadn't gone with you,

1097
02:03:45,250 --> 02:03:47,460
I might have been you.

1098
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:53,000
The one who ran away with her,

1099
02:03:55,980 --> 02:03:58,550
and strangled her would be me.

1100
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,490
No.

1101
02:04:01,210 --> 02:04:02,970
I'm serious.

1102
02:04:03,370 --> 02:04:05,310
You weren't.

1103
02:04:06,090 --> 02:04:10,150
Kaede fell in love with me.

1104
02:04:10,690 --> 02:04:12,270
It's true.

1105
02:04:14,430 --> 02:04:16,960
She was just playing with you.

1106
02:04:26,100 --> 02:04:27,750
Let's go.

1107
02:05:18,310 --> 02:05:19,980
Anybody?

1108
02:05:21,090 --> 02:05:22,500
Quiet!

1109
02:05:23,630 --> 02:05:26,780
Car crash? Your licence please.

1110
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:32,910
I killed someone.

1111
02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:35,960
You've been drinking?

1112
02:05:38,520 --> 02:05:40,390
I killed someone.

1113
02:05:41,390 --> 02:05:44,680
I'm turning myself in.

1114
02:05:45,460 --> 02:05:49,680
Mr. Yo! Mr. Yo!
A murder!

1115
02:05:49,990 --> 02:05:52,580
He killed someone.
He's turning himself in.

1116
02:05:52,790 --> 02:05:54,430
Bastard!

1117
02:05:54,730 --> 02:05:58,220
No! Not him!
I'm the killer!

1118
02:06:28,350 --> 02:06:31,120
Where have you been?

1119
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:33,910
They came here for us.

1120
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:39,250
When we were kids,

1121
02:06:39,340 --> 02:06:42,050
they used a blunt razor
to shave our heads.

1122
02:06:42,410 --> 02:06:44,630
She won't believe it.

1123
02:06:46,660 --> 02:06:48,310
It's true.

1124
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:50,700
It's most painful
around the ears.

1125
02:06:50,810 --> 02:06:54,010
So unbearable that
we left in the middle of it.

1126
02:06:55,750 --> 02:06:57,910
Shya... Shya...

1127
02:06:58,720 --> 02:07:01,720
Dad sharpened his razor
with a grin.

1128
02:07:01,830 --> 02:07:05,370
Stop it!
Such painful memories!

1129
02:07:07,490 --> 02:07:09,350
Mitsuo. Come here and eat.

1130
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:12,460
<i>- I Miss My Ex!
- Ginza Love Story!</i>

1131
02:07:12,560 --> 02:07:14,520
<i>Love in Tochigi!</i>

1132
02:07:15,660 --> 02:07:17,720
Ayako, sing with us.

1133
02:07:44,660 --> 02:07:49,930
<i>Welcome! Kukukuku...</i>

1134
02:07:50,430 --> 02:07:54,100
<i>My blue bird.</i>

1135
02:07:55,120 --> 02:08:03,100
<i>Stays on my heart
that's in love.</i>

1136
02:08:03,790 --> 02:08:09,240
<i>With the wind...
Kukukuku...</i>

1137
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:13,730
<i>Goes my message.</i>

1138
02:08:14,310 --> 02:08:22,160
<i>"I'm the happiest
person on Earth!"</i>

1139
02:08:22,970 --> 02:08:24,730
<i>Please...</i>

1140
02:08:27,050 --> 02:08:29,730
Ayako, sing with me.

1141
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:37,190
Help me out, my wife.

1142
02:08:37,350 --> 02:08:38,830
You're under arrest!

1143
02:08:43,050 --> 02:08:47,420
<i>Welcome! Kukukuku...</i>

1144
02:08:47,570 --> 02:08:50,730
<i>My blue bird.</i>

1145
02:08:51,740 --> 02:08:58,550
<i>Stays on my heart
that's in love.</i>

1146
02:08:59,590 --> 02:09:03,680
<i>With the wind...
Kukukuku...</i>

1147
02:09:03,770 --> 02:09:07,040
<i>Goes my message.</i>

1148
02:09:07,940 --> 02:09:15,090
<i>"I'm the happiest
person on Earth!"</i>

1149
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:23,110
<i>Please don't go.
Stay here.</i>

1150
02:09:23,650 --> 02:09:31,270
<i>'Cause my heart
is singing my happiness.</i>

1151
02:09:31,540 --> 02:09:33,140
<i>Singing it!</i>

1152
02:09:33,410 --> 02:09:40,590
<i>Kukukuku! Kukukuku!
Blue bird!</i>

1153
02:09:41,140 --> 02:09:48,440
<i>Please don't go.
Stay here.</i>

1154
02:09:49,070 --> 02:09:56,430
<i>'Cause my heart
is singing my happiness.</i>

1155
02:09:56,660 --> 02:09:58,510
<i>Singing it!</i>

1156
02:09:58,640 --> 02:10:04,680
<i>Kukukuku! Kukukuku!
Blue bird!</i>

1157
02:10:04,930 --> 02:10:06,300
One more time!

1158
02:10:06,660 --> 02:10:11,980
<i>Kukukuku! Kukukuku!
Blue bird!</i>

1159
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:13,450
One more time!

1160
02:10:13,670 --> 02:10:20,820
<i>Kukukuku! Kukukuku!
Blue bird!</i>

1161
02:10:32,910 --> 02:10:35,440
Will you friend get
the death sentence?

1162
02:10:37,010 --> 02:10:41,910
He turned himself in,
police said he'd get 10 years.

1163
02:10:44,410 --> 02:10:47,870
He'll be 33
when he gets out.

1164
02:10:51,950 --> 02:10:54,410
The baby inside me
will be 10.

1165
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:58,660
Grade 3.

1166
02:11:19,440 --> 02:11:23,010
- Good afternoon.
- You've got time to talk?

1167
02:11:25,950 --> 02:11:28,390
Please hear me out.

1168
02:11:30,910 --> 02:11:32,860
Don't waste your time.

1169
02:11:33,100 --> 02:11:34,900
Hear me first.

1170
02:11:35,060 --> 02:11:37,450
This is our job,

1171
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:39,860
or we don't get paid.

1172
02:11:40,020 --> 02:11:42,470
We'll give you the best deal.

1173
02:11:43,850 --> 02:11:45,860
Presents for you.

1174
02:11:48,260 --> 02:11:50,400
Ayako. Don't take it.

1175
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:54,170
It's nothing.
Just to show our sincerity.

1176
02:11:57,280 --> 02:11:58,310
Go away!

1177
02:11:58,420 --> 02:12:00,520
- What are you doing?
- Go away!!

1178
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:05,480
Go away! Cockroaches!

1179
02:12:05,640 --> 02:12:08,870
Soon you won't be able
to live here! Damn farmer!

1180
02:12:24,760 --> 02:12:26,660
Your face is black.

1181
02:12:26,790 --> 02:12:29,870
Looks funny? If it's funny
I'll wash my face.

1182
02:12:30,020 --> 02:12:35,000
That's OK. Peasants
don't powder their faces.

1183
02:14:59,370 --> 02:15:02,710
THE END
