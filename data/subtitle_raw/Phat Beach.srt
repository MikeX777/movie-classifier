i told you not to

00:02:15,722 --> 00:02:18,132
okay, mom,
i'm very sorry.

32
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:20,156
benny, come downstairs
and help me wash the car.

33
00:02:20,164 --> 00:02:22,334
all right, i'll be right out, dad.
one second.

34
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:24,174
don't take that tone
with me, boy!

35
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:26,012
you've been up here
an hour and a half.

36
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:27,609
you think water
grows on trees?

37
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:29,782
don't take that long
to wash your big, wide ass.

38
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,693
what is there,
a drought around here or something?

39
00:02:31,687 --> 00:02:33,617
i heard that.

40
00:02:33,624 --> 00:02:38,174
there's gonna be a drought on food,
you keep talkin' back.

41
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:42,368
(chuckles)

42
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:48,724
- so i see you're not stickin' to your diet, huh?
- this is low-fat.

43
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:50,891
put it down.

44
00:02:50,892 --> 00:02:52,902
get that off of there!

45
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,740
so, first day
on the new job, huh?

46
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:59,709
- excited?
- no, dad, i--

47
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,780
you know,
i remember my first job back in college-- milking cows.

48
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,893
not very glamorous,
but taught me to respect the dollar.

49
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:07,959
i thought this summer i'd just take a poetry class.

50
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,129
no, you're gonna have plenty of time
for poetry back in school next fall.

51
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:15,212
- this summer it's work. physical, manual work.
- but, dad--

52
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:17,507
nothing like physical work,
especially for a boy in your shape.

53
00:03:17,512 --> 00:03:19,422
get you moving a little bit.

54
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:21,715
but, dad, only 10 people
got accepted to this class.

55
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,230
benjamin, writin' didn't buy this car.
hard work did.

56
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:29,867
every time i sit behind the wheel,
i feel like i can conquer the world.

57
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,910
i want you to know
that feeling, son.

58
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:33,377
- yeah?
- yeah.

59
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:35,446
so i could drive
the car now?

60
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,818
get that "conquering the world" feeling going.

61
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:40,219
i can even drive it to work,
'cause my bike is broke.

62
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:43,234
you ain't gonna conquer nothin' in my car.
take your sister's bike.

63
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,540
- but, dad, that's a girl's bike!
- who'll know?

64
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:48,905
- jesus, durrel! turn that shit down!
- sorry, mr. king.

65
00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:52,108
hey, what's up, benny?

66
00:03:52,114 --> 00:03:56,294
- so, what are your plans for the summer, durrel?
- oh, you know me.

67
00:03:56,289 --> 00:03:59,259

68
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:00,572

70
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:04,844

78
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:27,281
- oh, my father didn't think it was a good idea.
- you pussy!

79
00:04:27,284 --> 00:04:31,294
- come on, durrel!

00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:18,056

when he jumps the counter like
he's tryin' to attack me!

169
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:42,064
i thought there was a-a-a bee
or somethin' on her shoulder.

170
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,430
he was gonna attack me with
that look of lust in his eyes.

1005
00:51:47,927 --> 00:51:51,697
"to understand your dreams
and shout from the rooftops

1006
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:54,711
that you have found
the one you love."

1007
00:51:54,707 --> 00:51:56,847
- (laughing)
- wow.

1008
00:51:56,845 --> 00:51:58,845
i think that's
really eloquent.

1009
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:01,789
well, if that means
stupid, i agree.

1010
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:04,728
you guys are coldhearted.
he's a really nice guy.

1011
00:52:04,727 --> 00:52:07,627
- not like his friend durrel.
- both: durrel?

1012
00:52:07,633 --> 00:52:10,003

1020
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:31,550

a ride in his mercedes.

1021
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:33,748

1023
00:52:38,027 --> 00:52:40,527
i've been looking
for you all day.

1024
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,972
- oh, really?
- uh-huh.

1025
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:45,480
- who was that?
- oh-- phhh!

1026
00:52:45,476 --> 00:52:47,406
(laughs)
no one.

1027
00:52:47,412 --> 00:52:50,422
so, um, i thought
i wasn't your type.

1028
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:53,928
oh, come on.
that was just talk.

1029
00:52:53,925 --> 00:52:56,925
i didn't think you'd give up so easily.

1030
00:52:59,269 --> 00:53:02,339
so, um, what are you
doing tonight?

1031
00:53:02,342 --> 00:53:04,882
- whatever you are, baby.
- (giggles)

1032
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,951
well, then,
what do you say

1033
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:09,991
we go for a nice,
long ride along the coast?

1034
00:53:09,991 --> 00:53:14,171
i'd do anything for just a nice,
relaxing ride.

1035
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:16,496
top down.

1036
00:53:16,504 --> 00:53:18,514
wind in my hair.

1037
00:53:19,744 --> 00:53:22,754
you know, i just
quiver all over

1038
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:25,960
just thinking
about it.

1039
00:53:25,956 --> 00:53:28,496
benny! benny, man.
i've been lookin' all over for you!

1040
00:53:28,495 --> 00:53:32,335
- where the hell you been?
- i'm just thinkin', man.

1041
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:34,205
i needs to borrow
the car tonight.

1042
00:53:34,206 --> 00:53:36,306
- <i>what?</i>
- i need to borrow the car. it's life or death!

1043
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:39,150
- no.
- don't make me beg, man.

1044
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:40,749
get out of my face, durrel.

1045
00:53:40,752 --> 00:53:43,762
i'll get on my knees and beg
like a little baby dog.

1046
00:53:43,758 --> 00:53:47,268
durrel, read my lips.
you're not touching my dad's car!

1047
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,895
but it's this girl, man.

1048
00:53:48,902 --> 00:53:51,512
- i think i really like her.
- yeah, you like her, huh?

1049
00:53:51,507 --> 00:53:53,507
like her enough to bounce
her on your dick?

1050
00:53:53,511 --> 00:53:55,981
no, man, i'm talkin' serious.
and i can get her if i--

1051
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:59,263
- lie to her and tell her you got a nice car?
- <i>no, it's not like that.</i>

1052
00:53:59,256 --> 00:54:02,256
- she don't care if i drive a bicycle.
- is that right?

1053
00:54:02,262 --> 00:54:06,802
well, you'd better get yourself a schwinn,
'cause i can't help you.

1054
00:54:06,804 --> 00:54:10,314
remember love, man?
you told me you were in love today.

1055
00:54:10,311 --> 00:54:13,381
i'd do anything to help you get that girl.
so help me.

1056
00:54:13,384 --> 00:54:17,394
you know how you don't like me abusing women.
this'll stop me.

1057
00:54:17,392 --> 00:54:21,172
i got a problem, man.
help me, benny. save me.

1058
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:22,736
you don't like this girl.

1059
00:54:22,736 --> 00:54:26,336
i think this could be the only
girl i'm ever with again, ever.

1060
00:54:26,343 --> 00:54:28,213
- you're lying.
- i'm serious!

1061
00:54:28,213 --> 00:54:30,523
- who is she then?
- met her at the beach.

1062
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:33,629
this shit is amazing.
we both come down here

1063
00:54:33,625 --> 00:54:35,795
and fall in love
in the same day.

1064
00:54:35,796 --> 00:54:37,796
<i>what happened</i>
<i>with your girl?</i>

1065
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,810
i just gave her this poem
that i wrote for her.

1066
00:54:40,806 --> 00:54:43,846
ah! aggressive.
what'd she say?

1067
00:54:43,845 --> 00:54:47,485
i don't know.
i ran away.

1068
00:54:47,486 --> 00:54:50,116
- you ran away?
- isn't it amazing?

1069
00:54:50,124 --> 00:54:53,634
she's gonna be sitting there
wondering for the rest of her life

1070
00:54:53,631 --> 00:54:55,841
what her life
could've been like

1071
00:54:55,836 --> 00:54:59,306
with this mysterious poet
she met on the beach, man.

1072
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:02,649
don't take much
to please you, does it?

1073
00:55:03,918 --> 00:55:06,918
(sighs)
all right, durrel.

1074
00:55:06,924 --> 00:55:09,104
one of us might
as well get the girl.

1075
00:55:09,095 --> 00:55:10,925
but don't be fuckin'
in it!

1076
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:13,372
- here.

1077
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:17,280

nope, but i tell you what.
you can take it out of the money you owe me.

1085
00:55:49,209 --> 00:55:51,379

00:56:08,481 --> 00:56:10,491
(women speaking swedish)

1090
00:56:36,002 --> 00:56:39,012
<i>(moaning,</i>
<i>giggling continues)</i>

1091
00:56:40,277 --> 00:56:42,147

1097
00:56:54,005 --> 00:56:56,235
i don't know.

1098
00:56:56,243 --> 00:56:58,253

1099
00:56:58,247 --> 00:57:01,147
- they in a hotel bar right down there.
- this hotel?

1100
00:57:01,152 --> 00:57:03,262
- what do you need with him?
- relax, my man.

1101
00:57:03,257 --> 00:57:05,997
i'm not looking for him.
i'm lookin' for that girl that he's with.

1102
00:57:05,996 --> 00:57:09,436
i don't know about her,
but durrel's pretty much into her.

1103
00:57:09,436 --> 00:57:11,436
hopefully not before
i'm into her,

1104
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,410
if you know what
i'm sayin'.

1105
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:16,250
- no.
- me and your boy put a bet down.

1106
00:57:16,249 --> 00:57:19,089
who could, you know,
wax that ass first.

1107
00:57:19,088 --> 00:57:23,058
a bet?
durrel doesn't even have anything to bet.

1108
00:57:23,063 --> 00:57:25,703
he put up his box
against my $300.

1109
00:57:25,702 --> 00:57:28,312
his box?
that's my box!

1110
00:57:28,307 --> 00:57:31,807

- <i>to kill durrel.</i>

1113
00:57:38,026 --> 00:57:41,366
durrel, that car

1114
00:57:41,366 --> 00:57:43,366
oh, yeah?
how do you handle?

1115
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:46,310
slow down, baby.

1116
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:48,309

00:58:57,284 --> 00:59:00,394
you fucked around with my
dad's car and this was all a bet?

1143
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:03,130
- relax, man.

1144
00:59:03,129 --> 00:59:05,599

1145
00:59:05,602 --> 00:59:07,612
man, you way too uptight.

1146
00:59:07,606 --> 00:59:10,176
all weekend you fucked around with the glasses,

1147
00:59:10,177 --> 00:59:12,517
and you treated
every girl like shit.

1148
00:59:12,516 --> 00:59:15,146
don't any of 'em mean
anything to you?

1149
00:59:15,153 --> 00:59:17,163
nope.

1150
00:59:17,157 --> 00:59:19,157
does this one even know
she's a bet?

1151
00:59:19,161 --> 00:59:21,671
what are you?
the leader of the women's movement or something?

1152
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:23,167
you act like
you know this girl.

1153
00:59:23,169 --> 00:59:24,739
durrel, i don't have
to know her.

1154
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,580
i just don't treat
people like that.

1155
00:59:26,577 --> 00:59:28,207
i don't care who
they are.

1156
00:59:28,213 --> 00:59:29,953
hi, durrel.
you ready to go?

1157
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:32,690
you. hi.

1158
00:59:32,689 --> 00:59:34,689

1160
00:59:39,703 --> 00:59:41,713

1161
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:44,007
benny, i'm sorry, man!

1162
00:59:44,011 --> 00:59:46,021
benny, i'm sorry, man.

1163
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:48,845
- how could you?
- i didn't know it was your girl, man.

1164
00:59:48,854 --> 00:59:50,894
it shouldn't make a difference whose girl it was, durrel.

1165
00:59:50,892 --> 00:59:52,902
you're right.

1166
00:59:52,896 --> 00:59:54,896
- you're a lowlife.
- i know.

1167
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,900
- a scumbag.
- i agree.

1168
00:59:56,904 --> 00:59:58,914
lower than the animal.
garbage!

1169
00:59:58,908 --> 01:00:01,748
someone who just don't care
about nobody but theyself.

1170
01:00:01,747 --> 01:00:04,747
what can i say except
i can't help it.

1171
01:00:16,777 --> 01:00:18,777
hey, wait, wait,
wait a minute.

1172
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,791
i just saw my car.

1173
01:00:20,785 --> 01:00:23,815
car?
does the word "obsession" mean anything to you?

1174
01:00:23,824 --> 01:00:26,804
this is the fifth time in two days
we've seen your one-in-a-million car.

1175
01:00:26,797 --> 01:00:29,097
no, baby.
i'm sure this time.

1176
01:00:29,101 --> 01:00:32,811
no, i'm sure you tired from driving all
over the world trying to find a hotel.

1177
01:00:32,809 --> 01:00:35,619
now, can we just go in here
and get a good night's sleep?

1178
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:40,789
more than any animal.
garbage, trash.

1179
01:00:40,792 --> 01:00:43,532
a person who has no feelings
for anybody but himself.

1180
01:00:45,835 --> 01:00:47,765

01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:54,651

mr. johnson back.

1184
01:00:54,653 --> 01:00:57,593
he said i can come back to work
as soon as i'm physically ready.

1185
01:00:57,592 --> 01:00:59,302
then we do it.

1186
01:00:59,295 --> 01:01:01,295
all right.
let's just get our bags and go.

1187
01:01:01,299 --> 01:01:03,299
- okay.
- all right.

1188
01:01:03,303 --> 01:01:06,583
- there's just one small problem.
- what?

1189
01:01:06,577 --> 01:01:10,077
it's a yellow mercedes,
license plate "doctor t."

1190
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:12,093

1191
01:01:12,087 --> 01:01:14,527
- do i get a blow with that?
- durrel, we'll never get the car back!

1192
01:01:14,526 --> 01:01:16,556
nothing, nothing, nothing.
just a minute.

1193
01:01:16,563 --> 01:01:20,643
give me all the money you got, man.
i'll handle this.

1194
01:01:20,638 --> 01:01:23,138
that's all i got.

1195
01:01:23,143 --> 01:01:26,323
how 'bout $7
and some change?

1196
01:01:26,315 --> 01:01:28,815
- <i>(dial tone)</i>
- hello? hello?

1197
01:01:28,821 --> 01:01:31,831
damn it!
they hung up on you!

1198
01:01:31,827 --> 01:01:34,827
we didn't have
enough money.

1199
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:37,613
here we are,
alone at last.

1200
01:01:37,605 --> 01:01:40,105
- mm-hmm.
- this nice, warm bed...

1201
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:42,080
- mm-hmm.
- and this nice, warm room...

1202
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,150
- mm-hmm.
- next to that nice, warm ocean.

1203
01:01:44,151 --> 01:01:47,361
- mm-hmm.
- how 'bout some lovin' for mr. peppy?

1204
01:01:47,357 --> 01:01:50,357
mr. peppy's
had a long, hard day.

1205
01:01:50,363 --> 01:01:53,373
mr. peppy's day wouldn't have been so long and hard

1206
01:01:53,369 --> 01:01:56,379
if mr. peppy
hadn't forgot the map.

1207
01:01:57,512 --> 01:01:59,522
let's just go to sleep,

1208
01:01:59,516 --> 01:02:02,516
wake up in the morning and
forget this trip ever happened.

1209
01:02:02,522 --> 01:02:05,462
oh, but, baby,
it hasn't been that bad.

1210
01:02:05,461 --> 01:02:07,471
it's been real bad.

1211
01:02:07,465 --> 01:02:11,165
benny: <i>how could you be so stupid
to park in a handicapped zone?</i>

1212
01:02:11,172 --> 01:02:14,112
- don't yell at me.
- well, why did you park there then?

1213
01:02:14,111 --> 01:02:17,121
man, i didn't know handicapped people go dancing.

1214
01:02:17,117 --> 01:02:20,687
you think it's all a joke.
well, now you know they go dancing!

1215
01:02:20,691 --> 01:02:22,501
- benny: <i>and--</i>
- durrel: <i>and?</i>

1216
01:02:22,495 --> 01:02:24,925
benny: <i>and we ain't got no money for food</i>

1217
01:02:24,933 --> 01:02:27,513
<i>and i'm hungry and we ain't</i>
<i>got no money to get the car.</i>

1218
01:02:27,505 --> 01:02:30,075
jesus christ!

1219
01:02:30,076 --> 01:02:34,016
what else could you do to fuck up my life?
huh, durrel?

1220
01:02:34,018 --> 01:02:37,588
- what else could possibly go wrong?
- <i>(knocking)</i>

1221
01:02:37,592 --> 01:02:40,262
father: <i>hey, hold that shit down!</i>
<i>it's 3:00 in the morning!</i>

1222
01:02:40,263 --> 01:02:43,403
- sounds like my father.
- hey, open up.

1223
01:02:43,403 --> 01:02:45,343

earning a living for himself.

1230
01:03:01,907 --> 01:03:05,347
yeah, that benjamin is one
responsible kid you got there.

1231
01:03:05,347 --> 01:03:07,547
durrel,
hold it down.

1232
01:03:07,552 --> 01:03:09,562
yes, sir, mr. king.

1233
01:03:09,556 --> 01:03:11,556

1246
01:03:49,536 --> 01:03:51,536
ohh, that is

1247
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:54,710

01:05:35,413 --> 01:05:38,353
you look upset.
is something wrong?

1279
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:41,262
no. it's just that we can't
enter the tournament

1280
01:05:41,258 --> 01:05:44,128
because we don't have
the $25 entry fee.

1281
01:05:44,131 --> 01:05:46,141
i've got 20.

1282
01:05:46,135 --> 01:05:48,465
- give it up!
- shut up, durrel!

1283
01:05:49,809 --> 01:05:52,009
we can't take
your money, denise.

1284
01:05:52,013 --> 01:05:54,123
i want you to have it.

1285
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:57,457
candace and tanya didn't even
ask me to play on their team,

1286
01:05:57,458 --> 01:06:00,458
so maybe i can help you
beat them.

1287
01:06:00,464 --> 01:06:03,674
if you win,
you can take me to dinner or something.

1288
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:06,510
- okay. all right, cool.
