1
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,510
Strange beautiful grass of green...

2
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,598
with your majestic silver seas.

3
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,630
Your mysterious mountains
l wish to see closer.

4
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,634
May l land my kinky machine.

5
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,076
The first time l ever saw a movie
at the Cinematheque Francaise...

6
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,920
l thought only the French...

7
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,158
would house a cinema
inside a palace.

8
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,758
The movie was Sam Fuller's
'Shock Corridor'.

9
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,589
lts images were so powerful,
it was like being hypnotised.

10
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,794
l was 20 years old.
lt was the late 60s.

11
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,640
l'd come to Paris for a year
to study French.

12
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,229
Here l got my real education.

13
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,868
l became a member of what
was kind of a freemasonry.

14
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,470
The freemasonry of cinephiles.

15
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,796
What we'd call 'film buffs'.

16
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,638
l was one of the insatiables...

17
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,196
the ones you'd always find
sitting closest to the screen.

18
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,875
Why do we sit so close?

19
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,433
Maybe it was because we wanted
to receive the images first,

20
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,873
when they were still new,
still fresh,

21
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,118
before they cleared
the hurdles of the rows behind us.

22
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,908
Before they had been relayed back
from row to row,

23
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,553
spectatorto spectator,

24
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,037
until, worn out, second-hand,
the size of a postage stamp,

25
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,072
it returned to the
projectionist's cabin.

26
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,272
Doctor, l'm not nuts,
l'm here forthe paper!

27
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,915
Maybe, too, the screen
really was a screen.

28
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,354
lt screened us from the world.

29
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,799
But there was one evening,

30
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,389
in the spring of 1968,

31
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,997
when the world finally burst
through the screen.

32
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,352
Obeying an obscure coalition
of dubious interests,

33
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,029
the Minister Malraux has driven...

34
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,390
Henri Langlois
out of French Cinematheque.

35
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,559
Chaillot offered us all
a free and fair conception...

36
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,512
of film culture.

37
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,475
Now, for bureaucratic reasons,
culture's arch-enemies...

38
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,876
have seized this bastion of liberty.

39
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,118
Resist them!

40
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,516
-Liberty isn't given!
-lt's taken!

41
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,119
All those who love film...

42
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,628
-ln France.
-And abroad.

43
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,151
-Are with you.
-And with Henry Langlois!

44
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,439
Henri Langlois
created the Cinematheque.

45
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,472
Because he liked to show movies...

46
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,274
instead of letting them rot
in some underground vault.

47
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,199
He'd show any movies,
good, bad, old, new...

48
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,040
silents, westerns, thrillers.

49
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,199
All the new wave filmmakers
came here to learn their craft.

50
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,073
This is where modern cinema
was born.

51
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,597
What lies behind it: the police!

52
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,110
Langlois had been sacked
by the Government.

53
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,631
Every film buff in Paris
had turned out in protest.

54
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,672
lt was our very own cultural
revolution.

55
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,355
Excuse me...

56
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,073
Can you remove this?

57
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,315
-lt's stuck to my lips.
-What?

58
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,717
Can you remove my cigarette?
lt's stuck.

59
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,555
Yes, yes... Of course.

60
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,315
Sorry.

61
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,473
-What are you? English?
-No, l'm American.

62
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,637
You can put it out now.

63
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,636
-What's your name?
-Matthew.

64
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,832
You're here a lot.
But you nevertalk to anyone.

65
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,318
-Why are you always alone?
-l don't really know anybody.

66
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,120
-Why are you chained to the gates?
-l'm not chained to the gates.

67
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,752
You're awfully clean.

68
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,032
For someone who likes
the cinema so much.

69
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,753
Do you know Jacques?

70
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,032
lf shit could shit,
it would smell like Jacques.

71
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,833
My brother's gone to talk to him.

72
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,395
When he gets back,
you'll smell Jacques on him.

73
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,432
lt's like being around pigs.

74
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,951
-You speak English really well.
-What?

75
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,028
-You speak English really well.
-My mother's English.

76
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,231
Here's Theo.
When l introduce you, just...

77
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,272
-give him a sniff.
-Come on.

78
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,915
Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rivette,

79
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,919
and Renoir, Jean Rouch,
Rohmer are here.

80
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,839
Signoret, Jean Marais
and God knows who else.

81
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,155
Marcel Carne too.

82
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,032
Why is Carne here?

83
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,834
What should we do?
Stay or leave?

84
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,599
l don't know.

85
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,152
Theo. This is Matthew.

86
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,515
-You were right, he's American.
-Hi.

87
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,949
l've seen you around. You've been
coming to all the Nicholas Ray's.

88
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,915
-Yeah, l really like his movies.
-What? 'They Live By Night'?

89
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,269
More like...

90
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,518
'Johnny Guitar'
and 'Rebel Without A Cause'.

91
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,470
You know what Godard
wrote about him?

92
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,633
-No, what?
-'Nicholas Ray is cinema.'

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,592
-What's up with you?
-Me?

94
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,632
Stay with me! Quick!

95
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,318
Bastards!

96
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,077
Fascists!

97
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,552
-Bastards!
-Assholes!

98
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,428
And that was how l first met
Theo and lsabelle.

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,070
l could hear my heart pounding.

100
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,397
l don't know if it was because
l'd just been chased by the police,

101
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,478
or because l was already
in love with my new friends.

102
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,719
As we walked and talked,
about politics, about movies,

103
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,879
and why the French could never
produce good rock bands...

104
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,038
-l'm starving.
-l forgot the sandwiches.

105
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,153
l didn't want that night everto end.

106
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,319
Thank you.

107
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,949
-Didn't you bring anything?
-No, l'm okay.

108
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,549
Please, eat. Don't mind me.

109
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,117
-No, l'm really not hungry.
-l've broken it now. Take it.

110
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,517
-You're very kind, but...
-Take it when you're offered it!

111
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,074
Thank you.

112
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,358
Theo. Don't you have
something for Matthew?

113
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,438
-This is fine.
-l gave him a third of mine.

114
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,718
l didn't come here
to eat your sandwiches.

115
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,389
-He doesn't want it.
-Yes, he does.

116
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,548
-He's just too polite to say he does.
-You're both very kind.

117
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,035
Where are you from exactly?

118
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,275
San Diego.

119
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,754
What about you two?
Were you both born in Paris?

120
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,235
l entered this world
on the Champs-Elysees. 1959.

121
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,397
On the pavement.

122
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,759
-You know what my first words were?
-No, what?

123
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,153
'New York Herald-Tribune.'

124
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,756
New York Herald-Tribune.

125
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,189
'New York Herald-Tribune.'

126
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,519
New York Herald-Tribune.

127
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,195
Will you come to Rome with me?

128
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,316
-Here, right here. Here!
-No, there!

129
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,316
-Goodnight, Matthew.
-Goodnight.

130
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,236
l was born...

131
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,033
in a trunk...

132
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,995
in the Prince's theatre...

133
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,235
in Pocatella...

134
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,839
ldaho.

135
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,599
l was born...

136
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,916
in a trunk...

137
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,679
in the...

138
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,911
Prince's theatre...

139
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,874
Dear mom:

140
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,992
l've got some real news this time.

141
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,475
l've just met
my first French friends.

142
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,999
Hello?

143
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,395
Matthew?

144
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,074
-Who is this?
-Don't be suspicious. lt's me.

145
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,590
-Theo?
-Did l wake you up?

146
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,351
-l've been up for ages.
-You don't sound like that.

147
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,276
l always sound
like this in the morning.

148
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,199
l had to call early,
l've a class at nine.

149
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,516
You want to have dinner
tomorrow night with lsa and me?

150
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,233
A real dinner in a nice restaurant?

151
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,717
No, not in a restaurant.
Here. At home.

152
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,835
Yeah, sure, that'd be great.

153
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,792
Yes? Okay.

154
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,913
Theo, get off the phone.
lt's 09:00.

155
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,273
Meet us for a drink first.
At the Respite. Six o'clock.

156
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,831
-You know where it is?
-Boulevard Saint-Germain?

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,155

-Third floor!
-Third floor?

There's room in here for all of us.

160
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,552
Theo and l are contagious!

161
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,276
-We're very contagious.
-Contagious?

162
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,197
You shouldn't catch us!

163
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,876
-lt's beautiful.
-You think so?

164
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,513
Good luck.

165
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,269
Evening, maman.

166
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,192
What are you doing here?

167
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,152
-We're here for dinner.
-What?

168
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,078
With Matthew.

00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,595
-Didn't lsabelle say?
-Which Matthew?

170
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,952
This Matthew.
He's our new friend.

171
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,832
Matthew, this is my mother.

172
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,873
-Very pleased to meet you.
-Likewise.

173
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,513
You're American, are you?

174
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,677
Yeah, l'm from California.

175
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,428
Matthew lives in a nasty student
hotel. Rue Malebranche.

176
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,517
So we invited him to dinner.

177
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,399
-What's wrong?
-What can l say?

178
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,592
l'm cooking fortwo
and now there are five of us.

179
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,190
-Didn't Theo tell you?
-No, he didn't. And neither did you.

180
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,278
Have you got mashed potatoes
for brains or what?

181
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,757
-You were supposed to tell her!
-You're crazy!

182
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,270
Bitch, cow, slut...

183
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,120
Put a sock in it, you two!

184
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,439
l must apologise
for my children's behaviour.

185
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,518
No, l'm the one
who should be apologising.

186
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,149
Please don't put yourself out
on account of me.

187
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,829
Very sweet of you, seeing
as you're completely blameless.

188
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,839
Let me look at you.

189
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,191
l want you to make
a good impression on papa.

190
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,199
Dad, it's me.
We're eating in.

191
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,157
-And the cinematheque?
-Closed until further notice.

192
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,273
Can't you see we have a guest?
This is Matthew.

193
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,915
Sir.

194
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,033
-Matthew.
-Matthew's dining with us tonight.

195
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,190
My young Matthew.
lnspiration is like a baby.

196
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,754
lt does not choose a nice,
seemly hourto enterthe world.

197
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,551
lt has no consideration
forthe poor poet.

198
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,596
But when it does come,

199
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,997
when it deigns to come,
then you know it's...

200
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,319
Young man...

201
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,638
l was speaking to you.
l imagined you were listening.

202
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,036
l was. l'm sorry.

203
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,077
What?

204
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,512
Nothing, l was just...

205
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,679
You seem to be mesmerised...

206
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,872
by this tin lighter.
l'd like to know why.

207
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,954
-Well?
-George, Matthew's our guest.

208
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,199
l'm genuinely curious.
l'd like to know why.

209
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,360
l was fidgeting with lsabelle's lighter.

210
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,997
l wasn't really realising it, and then
l noticed and l thought it was rude,

211
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,077
so l put it down on the table.

212
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,796
But l put it diagonally across
one of these squares. Do you see?

213
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,592
Look, l'll show you.

214
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,071
That's when l noticed
that the lighter's length...

215
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,477
is exactly the same length
as the diagonal itself.

216
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,876
So l put it lengthwise...

217
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,956
along the outside edge. Look, it...

218
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,797
it fits there too.

219
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,798
But it fits there.

220
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,748
And it fits like this and like this.

221
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,998
And this way too.

222
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,589
And l bet you if l just split it in half...

223
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,836
you know it's gonna fit somewhere.

224
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,912
lt really fits anywhere.

225
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,033
See?

226
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,393
l was noticing that
the more you look at everything...

227
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,753
this table, the objects on it,
the refrigerator, this room...

228
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,429
your nose, the world...

229
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,192
Suddenly...

230
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,233
you realise that...

231
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,518
there's some sort
of cosmic harmony...

232
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,234
of shapes and sizes.

233
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,195
l was just wondering why.
l don't know why that is.

234
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,599
l know that it is.

235
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,110
You have an interesting friend here.

236
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,239
More interesting,
l suspect, than you know.

237
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,273
l mean, when we look around us,
what is it we see?

238
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,432
Chaos, isn't it?

239
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,676
Complete chaos.

240
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,951
Yet, viewed from above,
as it were, by God,

241
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,308
everything suddenly fits together.

242
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,392
My children believe that
their demonstrations and sit-ins,

243
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,477
and happenings...

244
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,120
They believe that
these possess the capacity...

245
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,791
not only to provoke society,
but also to transform it.

246
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,392
What is it you are saying?

247
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,353
lf Langlois is dismissed,
we shouldn't do anything?

248
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,471
lf immigrants are deported,

249
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,354
if students are beaten up,
we shouldn't do anything?

250
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,916
What l'm saying is that
a little lucidity would not go amiss.

251
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,153
So, everyone's wrong but you?

252
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,550
ln France, in ltaly,
Germany, America...

253
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,910
Before you can change the world,

254
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,192
you must realise
you yourself are part of it.

255
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,034
You can't stand outside looking in.

256
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,269
You're the one who stands outside.

257
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,877
You're the one who refused to sign
a petition against the Vietnam War.

258
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,112
Poets don't sign petitions.
They sign poems.

259
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,748
-A petition is a poem.
-Yes. And a poem is a petition.

260
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,758
Thank you, Theo,
but l'm not gaga yet.

261
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,076
l don't need you
to remind me of my own work.

262
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,239
That's right.

263
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,273
A petition is a poem
and a poem is a petition.

264
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,629
Those are the most famous lines
you ever wrote.

265
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,471
And now look at you.

266
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,479
-l hope l'll never become like him.
-Theo.

267
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,997
We should say goodnight.
We've got a long day tomorrow.

268
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,594
George?

269
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,917
Yes, sorry. You were saying?

270
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,679
We should get to bed.

271
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,874
You had something
to tell the children.

272
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,068
Yes, of course.
l'm sorry.

273
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,155
The cheques are on the mantelpiece.

274
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,510
Don't cash them until you need them.

275
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,671
Good night, everybody.

276
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,596
Good night, papa.
Have a safe journey.

277
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,753
Good night, dear.

278
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,678
Theo?

279
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,917
-A very good night to you.
-lt was a pleasure meeting you, sir.

280
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,319
-Good night.
-Good night.

281
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,398
-Very nice meeting you.
-Thank you so much for dinner.

282
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,433
lt's my pleasure.
lnvite Matthew to spend the night.

283
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,234
l don't like the sound
of Hotel Malebranche.

284
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,915
Good night.

285
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,711
Why haven't you dazzled us
with your philosophical speculations?

286
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,999
-l didn't know l was philosophical.
-Papa was awfully impressed.

287
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,111
Papa's full of shit.

288
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,279
l think you're lucky.

289
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,949
l wish my parents were that nice.

290
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,357
Other people's parents
are always nicerthan our own.

291
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,034
And yet, our own grandparents
are always nicerthan other people's.

292
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,354
That's true, that's absolutely true.

293
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,710
l neverthought about it before.

294
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,151
-But it's true.
-Matthew, you're sweet.

295
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,189
This is double the length of...

296
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,879
l'm for bed.

297
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,159
Are you staying?

298
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,194
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, l'm okay.

299
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,039
Goodnight, Matthew.

300
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,592
Everybody's got a father.

301
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,309
Yes.

302
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,714
But the fact that God doesn't exist,

303
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,639
doesn't mean he can take His place.

304
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,589
Okay?

305
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,232
-Yeah, it's fine.
-Goodnight.

306
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,151
-Goodnight.
-See you in the morning.

307
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,833
See you. Thank...

308
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,355
Thank you.

309
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,713
l need a man to love me.

310
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,953
Oh, don't you understand me, babe?

311
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,230
l need a man to love.

312
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,956
l want me,
someone to hold me when l...

313
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,470
call out for it.

314
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,189
Someone to be around me so l...

315
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,630
won't be afraid of it. 'Cos it...

316
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,909
Can't be now.

317
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,474
Can't be now.

318
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,910
Can't be now.

319
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,679
Can't be now.

320
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,315
Can't be just loneliness.

321
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,513
What the hell is wrong with me?

322
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,075
No, no, no, it just can't be...

323
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,913
Good morning.

324
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,072
What was that all about?

325
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,237
l was removing the sleep
from your eyes.

326
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,829
Theo lets me do his every morning.

327
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,189
-lt's a strange thing to want to do.
-Didn't you enjoy it?

328
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,154
-Was l supposed to?
-Naturally.

329
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,474
Up, up, up!

330
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,031
-What are you waiting for?
-lsabelle, l'm not dressed.

331
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,749
What are you doing?

332
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,235
What are you doing?

333
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,589
'l've been memorising this room.'

334
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,359
'ln the future, in my memory,

335
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,598
l shall live a great deal in this room.'

336
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,916
'Queen Christina', where Greta
Garbo bids farewell to the room...

337
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,270
in which she spent the night
with John Gilbert.

338
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,118
Bravo!

339
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,476
The bathroom's
at the end of the corridor.

340
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,672
Be there in one minute,
or we're coming back to get you.

341
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,195
Come in.

342
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,831
-Hello.
-Good morning.

343
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,555
Are you going to church?

344
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,073
Oh, sorry. You want
to use my toothbrush?

345
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,315
No.

346
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,830
-Sure?
-l'll use my finger.

347
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,317
-Sleep well?
-Yeah.

348
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,554
-l mean, fine.
-Yeah?

349
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,679
You know, Matthew...

350
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,475
you really do have
the most beautiful pair of lips.

351
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,431
Can l touch them?

352
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,189
You wanna touch my lips?

353
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,195
Okay.

354
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,037
They're so red and ripe...

355
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,272
and luscious.

356
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,232
So sullen...

357
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,113
brutal.

358
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,952
Let's see what you look like
with lipstick.

359
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,118
-l really should be going.
-You'd make such a pretty girl.

360
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,676
lgnore her, Matthew.
She sucks in all the air around her.

361
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,552
No, l really have to...

362
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,269
-be getting back to my hotel.
-No, why?

363
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,551
We were going to invite you to stay.

364
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,478
-Really?
-Sure.

365
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,193
Our parents have left.

366
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,471
They're going to be
in Trouville for a month.

367
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,228
You might like to move
yourthings here.

368
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,672
-Really?
-Sure.

369
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,715
-But you barely even know me.
-This way we get to know you.

370
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,991
You don't have
to stay in a hotel, do you?

371
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,192
We'll go and pick up what you need
with my mobylette.

372
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,552
-Come on.
-But...

373
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,314
What about you?

374
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,119
lt was my idea.

375
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,874
Jesus!

376
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,228
l'm going to check out
the Cinematheque.

377
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,954
-Don't take too long.
-Don't worry, l won't.

378
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,196
l don't have much stuff.

379
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,948
With us, you're not going
to need much.

380
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,637
Don't forget yourtoothbrush!

381
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,029
Okay.

382
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,390
Dear mom: l guess you're surprised
to be hearing from me so soon.

383
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,194
But l've just moved
into an apartment...

384
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,311
belonging to
a famous French author...

385
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,672
whose children are the same age
as me and have the same interests.

386
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,635
l'm getting in
with the right kind of people.

387
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,113
Say hello to father.
l hope he's not still mad at me.

388
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,072
Listen to this, Matthew.

389
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,750
''The difference between
Keaton and Chaplin...

390
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,429
is the difference between
prose and poetry,

391
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,790
between the aristocrat
and the tramp,

392
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,355
between eccentricity and mysticism,

393
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,073
between man as machine,

394
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,918
and man as angel.''

395
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,075
-Not bad, huh?
-That's good.

396
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,396
Except for me,
there's no comparison.

397
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,714
Why? Because Chaplin's
incomparable?

398
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,469
No.

399
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,598
Because Keaton is incomparable.

400
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,319
You think Keaton's
greaterthan Chaplin?

401
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,556
-Absolutely l do.
-You're not serious.

402
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,876
-Course l am.
-You're crazy.

403
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,232
You can't deny that
Keaton's funnierthan Chaplin.

404
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,475
l can.

405
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,877
You don't think that Keaton
is funnierthan Chaplin?

406
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,798
Nobody is funnierthan Chaplin.

407
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,594
Keaton is. Even when
he's not doing anything.

408
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,633
-And he looks like Godard.
-Keaton is a real filmmaker.

409
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,990
Chaplin, all he cares
about is his own performance...

410
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,077
-His own ego!
-That is bullshit.

411
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,510
-lt's not bullshit!
-Yes, it is.

412
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,997
You Americans understand
fuck all about your own culture.

413
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,998
No wonder you've never got
the point ofJerry Lewis.

414
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,714
Don't even get me
started on Jerry Lewis!

415
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,913
When Chaplin wanted to have
a beautiful shot, he knew how.

416
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,714
Betterthan Keaton,
betterthan anybody.

417
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,389
You rememberthe last shot
of 'City Lights'?

418
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,318
He looks at the flower-girl,

419
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,828
she looks at him,

420
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,229
and don't forget she'd been blind,
so she was seeing him...

421
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,919
forthe very first time.

422
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,988
And it's as if, through her eyes, we
also see him forthe very first time.

423
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,840
Charlot, the most
famous man in the world.

424
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,315
As if we've
never seen him before.

425
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,200
lsa, if you play
that fucking record again,

426
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,916
-l'll break it in two, okay?
-But you like Janis Joplin.

427
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,435
Stop it!

428
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,439
l said stop it, lsabelle!

429
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,713
Stop! Stop!

430
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,194
Matthew, tell me, what film?

431
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,630
-What?
-Name a film...

432
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,718
where someone tap-dancing
drives someone else crazy.

433
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,429
Forfeit to pay if you can't answer.

434
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,830
-You'll pay the forfeit!
-'Top Hat'!

435
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,113
Fred Astaire is dancing over
Ginger Rogers' room.

436
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,398
And she's mad
because he wakes her up.

437
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,795
l'm right.

438
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,949
He's good.

439
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,117
You thinking what l'm thinking?

440
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,909
What?

441
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,118
-'Bande a part'.
-You're right.

442
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,153
Why are you two
looking at me like that?

443
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,431
Well... you see, my little Matthew...

444
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,318
There's something Theo and l have
been meaning to do for a long time,

445
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,160
but we've been waiting forthe right
person to do it with.

446
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,829
-And l think you're finally it!
-To do what?

447
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,190
Try to beat the record
of 'Bande a Part'.

448
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,596
-What record?
-You've seen 'Bande a Part'.

449
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,077
The scene where the three of them
race through the Louvre.

450
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,075
They try to beat the world record
of 9 minutes 45 seconds.

451
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,954
-Of course!
-We're going to beat their record.

452
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,795
What?

453
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,309
What's the matter?

454
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,469
-Nothing really.
-Not afraid, are you?

455
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,479
-No, l'm not afraid.
-What then?

456
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,470
lt's easy for you two.
l'm an American, an alien.

457
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,228
lf l get caught, l get deported.

458
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,793
-We're not going to get caught.
-You don't know that.

459
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,390
They weren't caught in 'Bande a
Part', we won't be caught either.

460
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,830
-lt's a movie!
-Go get papa's stopwatch.

461
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,278
lt's a great idea, but...

462
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,199
-lt's not...
-This is a test.

463
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,552
Are you going to pass it or fail it?

464
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,079
Be careful. A lot depends
on how you answer.

465
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,593
9 minutes and 28 seconds.
We beat the record by 1 7 seconds!

466
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,154
We did it!

467
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,195
Matthew, my little Matthew.
You were wonderful!

468
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,392
'We accept him. One of us.'

469
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,432
'We accept him. One of us.'

470
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,517
We accept him. One of us.

471
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,711
We accept him, we accept him.

472
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,389
Gooble gooble,
gooble gooble.

473
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,592
'We accept him. One of us.'

474
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,029
One of us.

475
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,517
When your mother,

476
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,717
sends back all your invitations.

477
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,395
And your father...

478
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,513
to your sister...

479
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,950
he explains...

480
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,875
that you're tired of yourself...

481
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,829
and all of your creations,

482
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,392
won't you come see me...

483
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,958
Queen Jane?

484
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,874
Won't you come see me...

485
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,917
We accept you.
One of us, one of us!

486
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:49,594
Now all of the flower-ladies
want back what they have lent you.

487
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,233
That's Maman.

488
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,631
l'm too wet to answer.

489
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,678
lsa's smart but she doesn't know
how to deal with parents.

490
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,188
What do you mean?

491
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,710
l mean, it's not enough
to ignore them,

492
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,116
they should all be arrested,

493
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,318
put on trial,

494
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,830
confess their crimes,

495
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,716
sent to the country
for self-criticism and re-education!

496
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,351
They're already in the country.

497
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,188
They are at the seaside.
That's different.

498
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,755
Hello?

499
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,155
Hello?

500
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,389
Too bad.

501
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,070
My parents never go anywhere.

502
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,157
You have the house to yourselves.

503
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,799
Where are you going?

504
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,238
l gotta get out of these clothes.

505
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,670
lt'll be cold in your room.
Come into mine.

506
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,429
Okay.

507
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,955
You can wearthis.

508
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,555
Thanks.

509
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,233
l'm going to get a coke.

510
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,913
-Want one?
-Okay.

511
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,637
There may be trouble ahead...

512
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,752
-Matthew!
-Yeah?

513
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,913
-Open the door. My hands are full.
Just a second.

514
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,716
-Why didn't you open the door?
-l was...

515
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,878
l was dressing.

516
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,268
What film?

517
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:13,798
ln what film does a chorus line
dance like this...

518
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,594
with a singer in a fur coat?

519
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,235
l've seen this film?

520
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,034
-We saw it together.
-We did?

521
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,628
-Give me a clue.
-Certainly not.

522
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,638
Come on, be a sport.
The director's name.

523
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,069
No.

524
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,431
-The number of words in the title.
-l said no.

525
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,278
-lsabelle!
-No.

526
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,113
-The first letter of the first word.
-God, you're pathetic.

527
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,034
lsn't he pathetic, Matthew?

528
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,278
-Matthew, l bet you know.
-Don't you dare help him.

529
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,114
Did the Sphinx give Oedipus a clue?

530
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,355
Fuck you.

531
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,515
Give up?

532
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,035
Yeah.

533
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,195
-'Blonde Venus'.
-Shit.

534
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,836
-Marlene Dietrich, 1932.
-l know that.

535
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,235
Forfeit.

536
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,794
lf you insist.

537
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,798
l dare you to do now...

538
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,119
in front of us,
what l've watched you do...

539
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,159
in front of her.

540
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,589
Who?

541
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,039
l don't know
what you're talking about.

542
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,151
Oh yes, you do, my pet.

543
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,275
Forfeit.

544
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,479
What a bitch you are.

545
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,799
A bitch and a sadist.

546
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,674
Are you going to pay
the forfeit or not?

547
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,399
Very well.

548
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,035
Do it the way you did it, when you
thought no-one was watching.

549
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,997
Let's have a drink.
l'll meet you downstairs.

550
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,108
Matthew.

551
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,435
Yes?

552
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,115
Yes.

553
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,672
Why don't you admit
you were thrilled?

554
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,519
-What?
-Weren't you just a bit excited?

555
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,553
-What're you trying to get me to say?
-Nothing.

556
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,313
-l asked you a question.
-You know who you sound like?

557
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,319
-lsabelle.
-Why not? She's my twin sister.

558
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,511
-You two are twins?
-Yes.

559
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,473
-She'd be me if she were a man.
-You're not identical.

560
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,309
Yes, we are.
We're Siamese twins.

561
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,113
Joined here.

562
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,517
You're a strange one, Theo.

563
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,829
Half an hour ago...

564
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,590
you looked at her as though
you wanted to strangle her.

565
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,949
l did.

566
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,239
l don't understand you.

567
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,432
-Do you have brothers or sisters?
-Two older sisters.

568
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,551
Didn't you ever want
to strangle them?

569
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,400
Course l did, but l never masturbated
in front of them, and...

570
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,912
they never forced me to do anything
l never wanted to do.

571
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,752
Do you think lsabelle forced me?

572
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,269
Deep down, l knew things
couldn't go on as before.

573
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,630
Now the stakes had been raised.

574
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:44,111
For a while, there was a kind
of truce between Theo and lsabelle.

575
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,196
And then one evening...

576
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,715
Theo!

577
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,830
-What film?
-What film?

578
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,510
Name a film where a cross
marks the spot of a murder.

579
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,915
Or pay the forfeit.

580
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,957
-You too, Matthew.
-Me?

581
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:16,789
What...

582
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,428
-What have l done?
-Name a film or pay the forfeit.

583
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,678
-Time's up.
-You didn't even give me a chance.

584
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:34,919
-The film?
-'Scarface.' Howard Hawks. 1932.

585
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,556
And the forfeit?

586
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,079
Well...

587
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,949
Now.

588
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,160
As you know, lsabelle,
l'm not a sadist.

589
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,115
l just want to see everyone happy,
no-one left out.

590
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,039
So, l'd like you...

591
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,757
and Matthew...

592
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,789
to make love in front of me.

593
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:04,039
But not in here, l don't fancy sleeping
in someone else's spunk.

594
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,356
-No offence, Matthew.
-Where?

595
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,955
ln the spare room.
ln front of the Delacroix.

596
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,158
Maybe one reproduction
will inspire another.

597
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,679
l won't do it.

598
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,871
-You won't do it?
-You wouldn't.

599
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,593
Matthew isn't my type.

600
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,269
Okay.

601
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,151
l need to go to the bathroom.

602
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,835
Matthew!

603
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,715
Matthew.

604
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,713
Matthew.

605
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,595
Yes?

606
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:27,869
This is silly.
Come out of there.

607
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,228
Okay.

608
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,353
-Okay, all right!
-Too late, too late!

609
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:48,031
You're hurting me. l'm not violent.
l'm against violence.

610
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,910
-l'm not gonna resist, look.
-So, shut up. Okay?

611
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:53,635
Okay.

612
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,718
You aren't being very gallant.

613
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,792
ls the prospect of making love
to me so hateful?

614
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,518
l've seen you.
l saw you in bed together.

615
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,150
Our guest has been spying on us.

616
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,758
That wasn't a friendly thing to do.

617
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,793
Especially when we've been
so hospitable.

618
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:23,035
Okay, okay!
l'm not resisting, l'm not resisting!

619
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:43,598
How sweet of you to keep
my image next to your heart.

620
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,108
l didn't mean...

621
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,955
Good.

622
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,789
Matthew!

623
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,672
Come on! Wake up!

624
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,233
Come on, wake up!

625
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,509
lsabelle?

626
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,758
No, l'm Theo.

627
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,799
Where's lsabelle?

628
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,518
You have to help me.

629
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,589
Sorry.

630
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,912
Oh my God!

631
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,075
That was the best one.

632
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,472
What about yesterday?

633
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,197
ln papa's study.

634
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,519
You thought that was better?

635
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,957
Please, please, please.

636
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:13,278
-What?
-Stay inside.

637
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,473
Okay.

638
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,553
Matthew.

639
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,953
My love.

640
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,392
My first love.

641
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,592
My great love.

642
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,152
My great lover.

643
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,793
My Valentino.
My funny Valentino.

644
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,068
l thought you had many lovers.

645
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,590
When l first saw you at the
Cinematheque, you and Theo...

646
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,439
you looked so cool.

647
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,914
So sophisticated.

648
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,712
Like a movie star.

649
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,435
l was.

650
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,591
l was acting, Matthew.

651
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,076
How did you and...

652
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,157
how did you and Theo...

653
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,668
come together
the way that you are?

654
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,155
Theo and me?

655
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,350
lt was love at first sight.

656
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,230
But he's never been inside you?

657
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,271
He's always inside me.

658
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,673
What would you do...

659
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,956
what would you do
if your parents found out?

660
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,758
lt must never happen.

661
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,151
Yeah, l know. But...

662
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,514
What if it did?

663
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:29,109
lt must never, never happen.

664
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,069
l understand that,
but let's say that it did happen.

665
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,758
What would you...

666
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,639
what would you do?

667
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,352
l would kill myself.

668
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,590
-Where are you going?
-Kitchen.

669
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,158
-l have to get something to eat.
-Good luck.

670
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,189
Theo.

671
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,949
Theo.

672
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,797
-Want some honey?
-No, thank you.

673
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,559
-Go on, it's good.
-No.

674
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,070
-lt's really, try some.
-No.

675
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:53,828
Just try a little bit...
-No, thank you.

676
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:06,434
l want you to know that l'm grateful.

677
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,719
Grateful?

678
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,151
Remember what you told me
in the cafe, about you and lsabelle?

679
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,958
You were right.

680
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,948
For me you two are...

681
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,073
like two halves of the same person.

682
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,035
And now you've made me feel
like l'm a part of you.

683
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,953
Both of you.

684
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,753
Let's get something straight, okay?

685
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,716
You're a nice boy
and l like you a lot. But, no...

686
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,516
it wasn't always meant
to be the three of us.

687
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,998
l told you something else,
remember?

688
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,160
That lsa and l are Siamese twins.

689
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,075
Yeah.

690
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,598
l wasn't joking.

691
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,679
What's this?

692
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,276
That, my dear brother, is a...

693
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:01,111
cheese fondue accompanied by
a compote of broccoli and prunes.

694
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,278
-And this?
-That's ratatouille.

695
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,514
-You expect me to eat this muck?
-You expected me to cook it.

696
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:12,110
-l preferto starve.
-You will. There's nothing else.

697
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,629
Matthew?

698
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,072
Can l serve you?

699
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,312
The fondue orthe ratatouille?

700
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,113
Which is which?

701
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,873
This is fondue and this is ratatouille.

702
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:32,197
No. This is the fondue
and this is the ratatouille.

703
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,676
The ratatouille.

704
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,354
Ratatouille.

705
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,954
That's fine.

706
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,757
Eat it as if you are
in some exotic country...

707
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:59,349
and this is the national dish.

708
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,235
lt looks like he's vomiting in reverse.

709
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,357
lt's horrible, isn't it?

710
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,557
l'm sorry, l know you tried.

711
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:26,071
Thank you, l'm glad somebody
appreciates my efforts.

712
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:29,636
-There's nothing in the house?
-Nothing you'd want to eat.

713
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,717
-And we cashed all the cheques?
-Yes.

714
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,992
-So what do we do now?
-l'm going to call papa.

715
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,918
The phone is dead!

716
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:10,517
lllegitimate son
of a rock and roll star.

717
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,869
lllegitimate son
of a rock and roll star.

718
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:31,878
Mom met dad in the back
of a rock and roll car.

719
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,433
Yeah.

720
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,749
What's all this?

721
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,079
lt's lunch.

722
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,716
So, lsabelle, a fillet mignon?

723
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,873
-No.
-No?

724
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:01,272
Matthew, would you like
a rump steak?

725
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,998
Stop it. lt's disgusting.

726
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,559
Oh, look.

727
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,232
What about this banana?

728
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,557
One banana forthree of us?

729
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,349
-Yes.
-l'm starving.

730
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,394
Let me see it.

731
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,229
-Why?
Just let me see it.

732
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,990
-What are you doing?
Just watch.

733
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,075
There.

734
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,116
Matthew, you never cease
to surprise.

735
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,595
Hey, Theo!

736
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:35,355
Hi.

737
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,595
-Okay?
-Fine.

738
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,838
-Where were you the other night?
-l couldn't make it.

739
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,712
We hardly see you now.

740
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,468
-We can't count on you.
-Stop pissing me off!

741
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,196
-You're not with us anymore.
-l am but it's complicated.

742
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:53,156
-Why?
-Get off my back. l can't explain now.

743
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,759
Arsehole!

744
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,913
Theo, wait for me!

745
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,677
-A little souvenir from Nepal.
-Thanks, that's sweet.

746
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:19,915
Call me.

747
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,350
Okay, with pleasure.

748
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,275
See you.

749
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,355
We hardly left
the apartment any more.

750
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,915
We didn't know or care
if it was day or night.

751
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:41,352
We were drifting out to sea,
leaving the world far behind us.

752
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,715
-Too strong for you.
-No, it was really good.

753
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:53,955
-Good?
-Yeah.

754
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,753
-Again?
-No.

755
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,516
Clapton is God, Matthew.

756
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:01,075
l don't believe in God.

757
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:04,909
But if l did, he would be
a Black left-handed guitarist.

758
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:10,318
This is not Chaplin and Keaton.
This is Clapton and Hendrix.

759
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:13,316
Clapton reinvented
the electric guitar.

760
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,875
-Clapton reinvented the guitar!
-Matthew, believe me.

761
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,799
-Clapton plugs in a guitar...
-Okay, Jimi Hendrix is different...

762
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,594
He plugs in an electric guitar and
he plays it like an acoustic guitar.

763
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,872
Hendrix plugs in an electric guitar,
he plays with his teeth!

764
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:33,192
There are soldiers
in the Vietnam War right now.

765
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:34,993
Who are they listening to?

766
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,157
Clapton? No.

767
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:40,672
They're listening to Hendrix.
The guy who tells the truth.

768
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,632
lt's all fucked up!

769
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,559
You're talking about soldiers
in Vietnam?

770
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,671
-Yes.
-What are they doing in Vietnam?

771
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,518
They're at war.

772
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,631
-What are they doing?
-They're fighting.

773
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,151
-They are killing peasants.
-They're dying, too!

774
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,318
They're killing children,
they're burning fields!

775
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,910
They wanna be there. They wanna
die and they wanna kill people.

776
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,555
Shouldn't you be in Vietnam?

777
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,909
-Shouldn't you be in Vietnam?
-l don't believe in violence.

778
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,316
Where are you now?
Shouldn't you be in Vietnam?

779
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,636
l'm lucky, l'm in a university.

780
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,639
l have friends
who aren't in university...

781
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,273
and they're expendable.

782
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,757
-You're not lucky.
-l am fucking lucky.

783
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,758
Do you think you can say
to the Government:

784
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,112
'No, l'm against violence.
l don't agree with your war.'

785
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,312
Maybe in France.
ln America you have to go.

786
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,272
lf you don't go, you go to jail.

787
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:36,793
l preferto go in jail,
instead of killing people.

788
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,798
You don't understand.

789
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,509
l read it in 'Cahiers de Cinema'.

790
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,554
A filmmaker is like
a peeping Tom, a voyeur.

791
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,956
lt's as if the camera is...

792
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,797
the keyhole
to your parents' bedroom.

793
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,472
And you spy on them,
and you're disgusting.

794
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,032
And you feel guilty,

795
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,519
but you can't...

796
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,228
look away.

797
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,995
lt makes films like crimes and...

798
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,390
directors like criminals.

799
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,992
Like it should be illegal.

800
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:19,075
There goes my chance
to be a filmmaker.

801
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,108
My parents always left
the bedroom door open.

802
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,555
You'll have to direct theatre,
not cinema.

803
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:28,955
Maybe.

804
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,429
Up.

805
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:38,829
Come on!

806
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,800
My parents only fucked
once in their life.

807
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:51,277
That's why we're twins.
They didn't want to make it twice.

808
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,718
Hey Joe!

809
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:13,239
Where are you going
with that gun in your hand?

810
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,839
Hey Joe!

811
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:19,510
Where are you going
with that gun in your hand?

812
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,636
And hey Joe!

813
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,829
Where are you going
with that gun in your hand?

814
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:39,599
l'm going down to shoot my old lady.

815
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:43,429
You know l found her messing
around with another man.

816
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,233
l'm going down to shoot my old lady.

817
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,196
You know l found her
messing around town.

818
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,556
Don't be alarmed, Matthew.

819
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,873
lt's good news.

820
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,671
lt only happens once a month.

821
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,673
l love you, lsabelle.

822
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:15,518
l love you too, Matthew.

823
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,598
Yeah, but l really love you.

824
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,952
And l really, really love you too.
We both do.

825
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,753
Oh, yeah.

826
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,668
That's not what l wanted you to say.

827
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,439
What do you want us to say?

828
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,675
l wanted you to say you love me.

829
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:35,439
-We just did.
-No, you said you love me too.

830
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,756
l don't want you to say
that you love me too.

831
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,996
l want you to say that you love me.

832
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,278
-We love you, we love you.
-That's not right either.

833
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,878
You have to say it first.

834
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,112
We can't, you already said it first.

835
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,119
Why am l always the first to say it?

836
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,196
Poor Matthew.

837
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,950
We do love you very much.

838
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,997
l don't want to be loved very much.
l want to be loved.

839
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,996
You know when someone wants it,

840
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,875
there's no such thing as love.
There are only proofs of love.

841
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,039
Are you ready to give us
a proof of your love?

842
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:21,639
You want proof of my love?

843
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,359
Okay.

844
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,878
Get out of the bath.

845
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,832
Shaving cream.

846
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,790
-Razor.
-Thanks.

847
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,431
-What are you doing?
-What do you think l'm doing?

848
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,676
-You're not serious?
-Yes, l am.

849
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,758
Don't worry. lt's an operation
l've performed before.

850
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,316
-Relax, it grows back.
-You're both fucking crazy!

851
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,674
-What's the matter?
-This is what you call proof of love?

852
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:03,951
Turning me into a freak?
'One of us.'

853
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,798
-lt's just a game.
-'One of us.'

854
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,479
lt's just a game!

855
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:10,758
A game, lsabelle?
A game? Think about it.

856
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:14,392
ls this something
you do to each other?

857
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:17,958
You want me to be
a little boy for you?

858
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:22,119
A little pre-pubescent Theo at six
who you can play games with?

859
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,594
And you could touch peepee.

860
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,154
l'll show you mine,
you show me yours!

861
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:31,117
Just calm down. We hear you.
-Theo, think about it. Think.

862
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,154
You sleep in the same bed
together every night.

863
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,273
You bathe together,
you pee in the john together.

864
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:40,120
You play these little games.

865
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:43,870
l wish you could step out
of yourselves and just look.

866
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,549
Why are you so cruel?

867
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,752
-Because l love you.
-A strange way of showing it.

868
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:52,554
l really love you. Both of you.

869
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,751
And l admire you.

870
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:58,555
And l look at you and
l listen to you and l think...

871
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:01,392
you're never gonna grow.

872
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:04,478
You won't grow like this. You won't.

873
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:09,356
Not as long as you keep clinging
to each otherthe way that you do.

874
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:14,598
-Have you ever been out on a date?
-A date?

875
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,632
-Yeah, a date.
-What kind of date?

876
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,639
-Have you ever been out with a boy?
-With Theo.

877
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,512
Not Theo.

878
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,998
Have you ever been out with a boy,
that you met at school?

879
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,555
l was nevertaken to a school prom.

880
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:32,516
-We don't have proms in France.
-You have dates in France.

881
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,429
Have you ever been out with a boy?

882
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,837
Why do you keep asking me that?
You know l haven't.

883
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,792
Would you like to?

884
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:43,435
-ls this an invitation?
-lt's an invitation.

885
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:47,349
Would you like to go out on a date
with me? Just the two of us.

886
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:50,071
Don't look at Theo.

887
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,874
You don't need his permission.

888
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:28,797
We can't sit in the front row,
we have to sit at the back.

889
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,709
The front is for people
who don't have dates.

890
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:34,270
Sorry. Excuse me.

891
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,599
On a date, you always sit
at the back.

892
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,708
Ladies and gentlemen...

893
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:02,070
the motion picture you are about
to see is a story of music.

894
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,552
l play the role of Tom Miller,
an agent.

895
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,520
A small-time theatrical agent
who had been a...

896
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:12,430
Well, you'll see.

897
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,714
This picture was photographed
in the grandeur of cinemascope.

898
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:20,588
Pardon me.

899
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,634
Sorry l can't stay,
but l have a train on tap.

900
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,631
All the best, Georgie.

901
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:44,959
You can't stand to hear me
sing again, huh?

902
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,159
You know it isn't that.

903
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,348
You'll never know.

904
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:54,438
No, l know l won't be fooled.

905
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,514
When l'm being true.

906
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,998
But if you guess it,

907
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,676
l'll confess it.

908
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:09,715
Oh, darling,
l would like to know.

909
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,231
Or perhaps you'll never...

910
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,716
No, no, you'll never...

911
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,117
Oh, no, you'll never...

912
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:23,349
ever know.

913
01:19:24,160 --> 01:19:26,754
You'll never know.

914
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,119
When l looked at the TV screen,

915
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,868
l remembered the battle
of the Cinematheque.

916
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:08,158
Except this time the demonstrators
weren't film buffs.

917
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,874
They weren't even just students
any longer.

918
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,235
lt was hard to figure out
what was happening, but...

919
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,512
shops had closed their doors,
factories had gone on strike...

920
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:22,031
and it was beginning to spread
all over Paris.

921
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:28,870
We're willing to consider
all legitimate demands.

922
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:32,796
Theo and l never watch television.

923
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,513
We're purest.

924
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:35,994
Pure and hard.

925
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,118
-Let's go.
-Yeah, but...

926
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:42,958
Jesus!

927
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:40,115
-What's wrong?
-They're not mine.

928
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:51,352
-No, your room.
-No.

929
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:55,759
ln all the time l've been here,
l haven't seen your room.

930
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,472
-You do have a room of your own?
-Of course l have.

931
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:02,557
Don't think l always live
in Theo's pigsty.

932
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,717
How come we never go in there?

933
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,753
No-one's making love on my bed.

934
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:11,874
lt's your room, it's part of you,
l wanna see it.

935
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:15,158
Just tonight.
-No, no, and no.

936
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:34,517
l discovered a side of lsabelle
l'd never seen before.

937
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,598
A secret side
she hadn't wanted me to see.

938
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,992
l suddenly thought of my sisters'
bedrooms in San Diego.

939
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,472
l thought of our house and our
neighbours' houses, all alike,

940
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,876
with their green lawns
and their sprinklers,

941
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:51,038
and their station wagons
parked outside.

942
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,872
That you're dreaming of.

943
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:01,239
l know the word...

944
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:07,710
that you long to hear.

945
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:14,948
l know your deepest secret fear.

946
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:21,278
l'm a spy...

947
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:27,716
in the house of love.

948
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,714
l know the dream...

949
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,758
that you're dreaming of.

950
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,673
What sculpture?

951
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:49,752
l always wanted to make love
to the Venus de Milo.

952
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,429
l can't stop you.

953
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,432
l've got no arms.

954
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,036
l can't stop you.

955
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:41,709
What's wrong?

956
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:43,675
What's wrong?

957
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:48,118
Don't. Don't. Don't.

958
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,671
Don't listen to it.

959
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,069
Don't cry, don't cry.

960
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:58,913
Please, leave me alone.

961
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:00,679
Leave me alone, please.

962
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:03,314
Please!

963
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,318
-Go away!
-lsabelle!

964
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,872
-lsabelle!
-Theo, open up!

965
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,277
-Theo!
-lsabelle!

966
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,956
You're gonna hurt yourself!

967
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:23,158
-Who are you?
-What are you talking about?

968
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:25,351
What are you doing in my room?

969
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,995
Get out! Get out!

970
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:31,070
Theo! Theo!

971
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,398
Theo!

972
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,473
Theo!

973
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,069
Theo!

974
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:43,795
Theo.

975
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,554
''A revolution isn't a gala dinner.''

976
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:10,034
''lt cannot be created like a book,
a drawing or a tapestry.''

977
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:14,233
''lt cannot unfold with such elegance,
tranquility and delicacy,

978
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:19,389
or with such sweetness, affability,
courtesy, restraint and generosity.''

979
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,956
''A revolution is an uprising,

980
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:23,559
a violent act...

981
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,832
by which one class
overthrows another.''

982
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:15,832
''Chateau Lafite, 1955.''

983
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,718
''Chateau Chasse Spleen, 1959.''

984
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,669
''Grand vin, 1937.''
Happy Birthday, papa!

985
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:30,795
Again?

986
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:34,276
-Listen, Matthew.
-Yes?

987
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,028
-You're a big movie buff, right?
-Yes.

988
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:41,030
Then think of Mao
as a great director...

989
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,435
making a movie
with a cast of millions.

990
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:49,554
All those millions of Red Guards
marching together into the future...

991
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:53,594
with the Little Red Book
in their hands.

992
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,635
Books, not guns.

993
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,388
Culture, not violence.

994
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:04,558
Can't you see what a beautiful epic
movie that would make?

995
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:07,388
l guess, but...

996
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,796
lt's easy to say books not guns.

997
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:12,470
But it's not true.
lt's not 'books'.

998
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:16,350
lt's 'book', a book.
Just one book.

999
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,517
Shut up. You sound
just like my father.

1000
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,358
No, listen to me.

1001
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:23,074
The Red Guards
that you admire,

1002
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,749
they all carry the same book,

1003
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:27,996
they all sing the same songs,

1004
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:30,430
they all parrot the same slogans.

1005
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:35,157
ln this big epic movie,

1006
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:38,159
everybody is an extra.

1007
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:42,077
That gives me the creeps.

1008
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:44,759
l'm sorry to say it, but...

1009
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:49,269
for me there is
a distinct contradiction.

1010
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,075
Why?

1011
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,028
Because...

1012
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:58,191
if you really believed what you were
saying, you'd be out there.

1013
01:28:58,680 --> 01:28:59,749
Where?

1014
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:01,871
Out there on the street.

1015
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,632
-l don't know what you mean.
-Yes, you do.

1016
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,194
There's something
going on out there.

1017
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,438
Something that feels like
it could be really important.

1018
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:13,554
Something that feels like things
could change. Even l get that.

1019
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,399
But you're not out there.

1020
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:19,753
You're inside with me, drinking
expensive wine, talking about film.

1021
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:22,838
-Talking about Maoism. Why?
-That's enough.

1022
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:24,348
No, tell me why.

1023
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,358
Ask yourself why.

1024
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,351
l don't think you believe it.

1025
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:32,029
l think you buy the lamp,
you put up the posters,

1026
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,355
but it ain't...

1027
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:37,237
-l don't think you...
-Look, you speak too much.

1028
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:38,475
Okay.

1029
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:43,430
Theo, just listen to me.

1030
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:46,155
l think you prefer...

1031
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:49,000
l think you prefer when...

1032
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,433
when the word 'together'
means not...

1033
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,075
a million, but just two.

1034
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,155
Boys, boys!

1035
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:01,475
Orthree.

1036
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:08,715
lsa, come and join us.

1037
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,839
No, thank you.
lt stinks of whores here.

1038
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,958
Thanks a lot.

1039
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:16,635
l've got a surprise for you
in the salon.

1040
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,317
l'm getting right in!

1041
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:31,238
-lt's beautiful.
-Come on, get in.

1042
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,316
We did this when we were little.

1043
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:47,269
More wine?

1044
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,555
