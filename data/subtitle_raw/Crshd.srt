00:02:17,947 --> 00:02:18,948
Whoa.

3
00:02:20,983 --> 00:02:21,984
You okay?

4
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:25,154
You really-

5
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:27,824
Your face was like that.

6
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:31,928
Yeah, I'm fine.

7
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:39,401
Okay.

8
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:51,981
I won't hurt your sprint.

9
00:03:16,038 --> 00:03:17,173
I love it.

10
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:21,110
Yeah, those shoes are dope.

11
00:03:21,144 --> 00:03:22,612
Like we should make an
Instagram page for 'em.

12
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:23,880
What
should the handle be?

13
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:25,148
White Girl, White Boots

14
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,515
I'm gonna start one on it.

15
00:03:26,548 --> 00:03:29,685
Yeah, let's just like, you know,
like boots chillin', right?

16
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:30,987
Okay, boots on the quad.

17
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,420
What did
you use to paint these?

18
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:33,689
Just like a color.

19
00:03:56,712 --> 00:03:58,014
Killin', right?

20
00:03:58,047 --> 00:03:59,282
Okay, boots on the quad.

21
00:03:59,314 --> 00:04:00,750
Boots on the quad baby.

22
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:02,417
Oh my
God, those socks are so good.

23
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,586
GIRL WITH RED
SKIRT: Thank you.

24
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,121
You're such a good artist.

25
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:06,722
Honestly, you're-

26
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:09,792
- At work, chill 'till two,
come hang before lunch.

27
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:12,161
Dope, see you in
an hour or so, Anuka?

28
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:13,796
Yay, heart emoji.

29
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:16,799
It's brewed
so much that I just like,

30
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,333
I don't know,

31
00:04:18,366 --> 00:04:20,069
I just randomly made them one
night when I was really drunk.

32
00:04:20,102 --> 00:04:22,872
Zero percent chance of me
losing my virginity tonight,

33
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:24,974
thumbs down emoji,
eggplant emoji.

34
00:04:25,007 --> 00:04:27,442
We made a pact,
it's our last night.

35
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,945
We have to hold each
other accountable.

36
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:31,714
Just don't forget, you're
the only one who knows.

37
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:35,251
DWAI, babe, you're
secret is safe with me.

38
00:04:35,284 --> 00:04:36,052
Kissy face emoji.

39
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:43,125
Mark, 22, this could be us.

40
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:46,028
Jason, 24, TTF only.

41
00:04:46,062 --> 00:04:51,067
Alexander, 27,
I'm a real catch.

42
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:52,101
Albert.

43
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:53,970
Georgie.

44
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:57,106
22, I'm cooking pasta

45
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:59,675
and we can watch a movie
with my cat, Snickers.

46
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,949
- Hey.
- Shit, sorry.

47
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:08,150
I must have scared you.

48
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:10,620
No, I, just didn't see you.

49
00:05:10,653 --> 00:05:12,121
Sorry about that.

50
00:05:12,154 --> 00:05:15,157
So are you ready
for the astro test?

51
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:16,192
Uh.

52
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:19,461
- I'm really not sure either.
- Yeah.

53
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:20,663
I'm kind of nervous though.

54
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,164
Yeah, I'm getting
tense as well.

55
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:26,636
But you know, that's my
demeanor, is always tense.

56
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:28,104
I don't really
know how to react.

57
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:30,606
I totally get it though, it's
like crazy freshman year.

58
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,343
Like, I stay up so
late sometime and,

59
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:35,443
there are regrets.

60
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:38,948
I feel like I barely got to
like open up actually to anyone.

61
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:40,883
Like see the real me.

62
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:42,385
That's a totally
different story.

63
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:44,020
Anyway, have you heard about
that party happening tonight?

64
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:45,054
- Yeah.
- Hi!

65
00:05:46,822 --> 00:05:49,091
- Wait for me?
- I wanna take a shower.

66
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:50,092
No, just one minute.

67
00:05:50,126 --> 00:05:51,661
- Okay, cool, see ya.
- Bye.

68
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:52,795
Who's that?

69
00:05:52,828 --> 00:05:54,096
I don't know, he's
in my astro class.

70
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,932
Look who it is.

71
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:59,335
Izz, getting down to
biz, all sweaty and shiz.

72
00:06:01,938 --> 00:06:04,106
Deb, this is my friend, Izz.

73
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,309
- Hi Izz, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

74
00:06:06,342 --> 00:06:08,277
You doing anything
interesting this summer?

75
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:10,079
I'm gonna spend the
summer with my grandparents

76
00:06:10,112 --> 00:06:11,446
outside Chicago.

77
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:14,684
I'm trying to pass my
drivers' test finally.

78
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:16,252
You know what they say?

79
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:18,187
Every time you get in a car,
you put your seatbelt on

80
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,589
and every time you have sex,

81
00:06:20,623 --> 00:06:22,925
- you use a condom.
- Really, mom?

82
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,026
Like right now?

83
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,029
- She's a sex educator.
- Thanks.

84
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:29,231
Well, time to get this
road on the show JuJu.

85
00:06:33,336 --> 00:06:35,204
Bye.

86
00:06:35,237 --> 00:06:37,539
Drive
safe my Indian princess.

87
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:40,142
He's still saying that?

88
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:55,291
Izzy, look at these notes.

89
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:58,560
You're totally ready
for your final.

90
00:06:58,594 --> 00:07:00,096
It was so easy
for me in high school

91
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,131
but this class is killing me.

92
00:07:02,164 --> 00:07:04,499
Can we just
have fun tonight?

93
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:06,869
I'll have fun
when I get to Chicago.

94
00:07:10,538 --> 00:07:12,641
Izzy.

95
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:16,145
You look fine.

96
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:19,648
It's just a black t-shirt.

97
00:07:25,788 --> 00:07:27,490
Excuse me, these
shoes smell like piss.

98
00:07:27,522 --> 00:07:29,291
Um, that's how
they all smell, so.

99
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:33,729
I'm not putting
those on my feet.

100
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:35,898
Yeah okay, well then
you can't bowl, so.

101
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:40,870
Can you just not do that?

102
00:07:40,903 --> 00:07:43,339
We have a very particular way
about cleaning about them, so,

103
00:07:43,372 --> 00:07:44,707
that's my job.

104
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,075
Well it seems like a bad way.

105
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:47,643
Because it still
smells like puke.

106
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,211
Cool.

107
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:51,881
Yeah, if you don't put
these on, you can't bowl.

108
00:07:53,049 --> 00:07:57,086
Okay, you can't
bowl in your socks.

109
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,522
Why do all the pretty girls
also have to be talented?

110
00:08:03,993 --> 00:08:05,828
So much more fair
if they all sucked.

111
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:09,098
Okay, you're acting like
you're not pretty and talented.

112
00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:10,332
I mean like your hair's doing

113
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:11,700
like a funny little
thing today but.

114
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:13,202
Have you seen her Instagram?

115
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,621
Lisa's so hot.

116
00:08:32,655 --> 00:08:34,256
Nolan is so hot.

117
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:37,526
They're both pretentious.

118
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:51,273
Come see my lovely art
at #crushparty tonight.

119
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,111
What's a crush party?

120
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,781
I don't know.

121
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:05,054
Be right back.

122
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,059
- Hey, hi.
- Hey.

123
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,360
- Hey.
- Hey.

124
00:09:11,393 --> 00:09:14,029
Why is everyone so
obsessed with her?

125
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:16,899
Her art isn't even good.

126
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,434
I like her art.

127
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:19,201
It's cute.

128
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,806
I don't want my
art to be cute.

129
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,774
Yeah, your art isn't cute.

130
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:28,277
I was just looking
at your Instagram.

131
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,845
Hmm hmm.

132
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,482
And I was just wondering
what a crush party is.

133
00:09:33,516 --> 00:09:37,253
Oh, a crush party
is, are you a freshman?

134
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,187
Hmm hmm.

135
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,889
I mean look at her shoes.

136
00:09:39,922 --> 00:09:42,024
She had to paint these as well?

137
00:09:43,092 --> 00:09:43,993
I don't get it.

138
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:02,511
No one's
even gonna be there,

139
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:04,246
everyone's left for the summer.

140
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,148
Yeah, that's why
everyone's gonan be there

141
00:10:06,182 --> 00:10:07,082
specially to bone.

142
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:09,118
Isn't that like every party?

143
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,452
Also, who says bone?

144
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:12,454
Uh, I say bone, boning is hot.

145
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:15,291
It sounds like ET, bone
home or throw a dog a bone.

146
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:17,459
No, it's like
come on bone me baby

147
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:19,195
or like come on, just
a quick little bone

148
00:10:19,228 --> 00:10:20,296
before this party tonight.

149
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,897
It sounds awful.

150
00:10:21,931 --> 00:10:23,265
Hey, you're
like a monk with a vagina.

151
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:24,466
That's a nun.

152
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,669
I haven't even
started studying.

153
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:27,369
We made a pact.

154
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:29,405
Fiona, if I do
not pass this test,

155
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:32,007
I'm literally dead and
will lose my scholarship.

156
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,776
- Wait, what pack?
- Okay.

157
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:36,111
You're gonna be stuck with
your grandparents all summer.

158
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:39,448
Um, eating oatmeal and
playing like badminton

159
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:41,850
and massaging their dog when
she's constipated, okay.

160
00:10:41,884 --> 00:10:44,654
You need to be freaking DM on
getting some dick right now.

161
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:48,390
Oh she'll do the guy
she did last summer.

162
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:49,191
What's his name?

163
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:50,426
Travis.

164
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,596
Oh Travis,
who is Travis.

165
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:53,862
Never mind.

166
00:10:53,896 --> 00:10:56,633
- If I submit my crush's name.
- Hmm hmm.

167
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:58,567
They get a
specific invitation.

168
00:10:58,602 --> 00:10:59,535
Yes.

169
00:10:59,568 --> 00:11:01,570
And if someone crushes me,

170
00:11:01,605 --> 00:11:03,505
I also get an invite.

171
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,374
Crush party.

172
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,612
There
was a dog trapped

173
00:11:08,645 --> 00:11:10,079
inside a sewage plant.

174
00:11:10,112 --> 00:11:11,747
It's unclear how
he ended up there.

175
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,549
But everything turned out okay.

176
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:14,850
He's back home safe
with his owners

177
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,485
eating a big bowl of kibble.

178
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:18,220
Thank
you Jeff, in other news,

179
00:11:18,254 --> 00:11:19,521
Huntington Center is hosting

180
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:21,691
the Midwest succulent
convention today.

181
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:22,758
Hi.

182
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,126
Admission is free

183
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,194
for children under 12...

184
00:12:10,072 --> 00:12:12,041
You need to friend
him on Facebook

185
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:14,343
and then deep like
one of his photos.

186
00:12:14,376 --> 00:12:15,645
Deep what?

187
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,580
It's like, you go way
back into their photos

188
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:19,181
and then like one.

189
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:21,751
So that it sends them a signal
that you're stalking them

190
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:23,452
and that you're
interested in them.

191
00:12:26,322 --> 00:12:28,223
I couldn't find
the one on Facebook.

192
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:30,125
I'll try to find
tagged photos of him.

193
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,397
My profile reads apathetic
with a touch of fuck boy.

194
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:37,433
It's clear that I took
time to curate my page

195
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,835
but not that much time.

196
00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:42,538
I love internet art
and I have a tattoo

197
00:12:42,571 --> 00:12:44,641
of my childhood stuffed
animal on my bicep

198
00:12:44,674 --> 00:12:46,508
so I have no pictures
of no one here.

199
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:53,449
I sort of forget to
update my profile picture.

200
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,084
It's been the same
for like two years

201
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:58,554
and I'm fairly hot but I don't
really like to show it off.

202
00:12:58,588 --> 00:13:00,522
But no picture
with Nolan, sorry.

203
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:04,594
What about that guy?

204
00:13:04,627 --> 00:13:07,529
I haven't changed my
profile picture since 2007.

205
00:13:07,563 --> 00:13:09,898
I only use Facebook to
follow banned pictures.

206
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:12,669
I don't have Facebook so
technically I don't exist.

207
00:13:12,702 --> 00:13:13,636
No, whatever.

208
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,537
And I think he's dating Elise.

209
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:19,576
Elise is gay, like
gay gay, not bi.

210
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:21,343
Because in one of our class,

211
00:13:21,377 --> 00:13:23,545
she brought in all
these paintings

212
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,850
of all the vaginas
of all her exes

213
00:13:26,882 --> 00:13:30,519
and then she talked about
all the breakups like

214
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:31,788
every story, so.

215
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:34,289
She's gay.

216
00:13:36,693 --> 00:13:38,327
What about that guy?

217
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:41,430
No.

218
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:43,700
I'mma gonna get some cereal.

219
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:45,934
Okay.

220
00:13:58,615 --> 00:14:00,082
Elise, 22.

221
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:02,985
Let's get naked and paint
each other's bodies.

222
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:05,354
Hey Elise.

223
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,026
Yo, what's up girlfriend, no.

224
00:14:13,962 --> 00:14:16,031
Question about the
crushed party, eh.

225
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,548
It's at Big Blue.

226
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:34,082
Just go there and
ask for Stephanie.

227
00:14:34,116 --> 00:14:39,054
She's like tall and stunning
and really hip and friendly.

228
00:14:39,722 --> 00:14:41,256
Just tell her you wanna
submit in a crush.

229
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,558
- Cool.
- Definitely go.

230
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:44,861
- It'll be so fun.
- Okay.

231
00:14:44,894 --> 00:14:46,495
See ya there.

232
00:14:46,528 --> 00:14:49,666
We're both getting action,
we're both getting action.

233
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:52,034
Shh, shh.

234
00:14:53,368 --> 00:14:55,204
You're always so loud.

235
00:14:55,237 --> 00:14:56,673
I prefer enthusiastic.

236
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:58,340
Isabel.

237
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:02,745
We made a pinky promise,
a pact, you and I.

238
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:04,781
I'm going to make
out with Elise.

239
00:15:04,814 --> 00:15:07,951
You are going to find
someone and bone them

240
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:10,552
and pop that sweet, sweet,
cute little cherry of yours.

241
00:15:10,587 --> 00:15:11,788
Shh.

242
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:14,591
You just have to um,
channel your secret,

243
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:17,594
inner female goddess
and have eye sex

244
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:19,729
with everyone on
the dance floor.

245
00:15:19,762 --> 00:15:21,196
Super simple.

246
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,998
Eye sex, hmm hmm.

247
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:24,399
You just find
someone in this party

248
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:26,803
and then you lock
eye, like this.

249
00:15:39,883 --> 00:15:42,084
Yeah, okay, try
it, try it with me.

250
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:55,230
Okay, hmm, hold eye contact.

251
00:15:55,264 --> 00:15:57,767
Okay, a little less diarrhea.

252
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,903
Okay, okay, let's stop.

253
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:03,038
Um, we're just gonna get
your very drunk, okay?

254
00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:10,613
I'm Sexy Rexy, AKA Mean
Profit, AKA Young Jump Start.

255
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:12,849
I love bowls of spaghetti,
my pod collection,

256
00:16:12,882 --> 00:16:15,618
Naruto fan fiction and dad bods.

257
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:18,120
I could be your
devil or your angle.

258
00:16:18,153 --> 00:16:19,789
Hope I made you turtle.

259
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:35,872
You really want that cereal?

260
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:38,574
It sticks together
when it's stale so.

261
00:16:38,608 --> 00:16:40,643
You can just take
some from the top.

262
00:16:40,677 --> 00:16:43,046
But punching it
might be more fun.

263
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:46,616
Genius, thank you.

264
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:55,959
No problem.

265
00:16:55,992 --> 00:16:59,361
I'm always like struggling
to get it open like...

266
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:05,034
I'll give
them back tomorrow.

267
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:07,036
Izzy, you...

268
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,705
Do you have an
early flight tomorrow?

269
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:10,472
- Hmm hmm.
- Hmm hmm, so.

270
00:17:10,505 --> 00:17:12,140
- Early morning.
- Right, yeah.

271
00:17:12,174 --> 00:17:13,175
We probably shouldn't
go out then.

272
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,443
See, you gotta
stop doing that.

273
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:15,678
You don't want to
be hung over tomorrow.

274
00:17:15,712 --> 00:17:16,746
- You are...
- Can we call it?

275
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:17,880
I have to go back to work.

276
00:17:17,914 --> 00:17:19,849
Someone took shoes,
I don't know.

277
00:17:19,882 --> 00:17:22,484
That means you have to
go to Big Blue, okay.

278
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:24,219
You need to submit Nolan.

279
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,555
I'm gonna submit Elise, okay.

280
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,390
It's two blocks down
the road, just go.

281
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:29,592
There should be a box.

282
00:17:29,626 --> 00:17:31,126
Find the box, if
there's not a box, knock

283
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:33,029
and ask for Stephanie.

284
00:17:33,062 --> 00:17:34,897
Apparently, she's really hot.

285
00:17:36,131 --> 00:17:37,634
Izzy, I know
where we're going.

286
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,201
It's that way.

287
00:17:39,234 --> 00:17:41,838
- It's that's way!
- Eh, no.

288
00:17:44,306 --> 00:17:45,407
Where are we?

289
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,577
I think this way.

290
00:17:52,815 --> 00:17:54,483
That way.

291
00:17:57,787 --> 00:17:58,788
Are you sure?

292
00:17:59,656 --> 00:18:00,923
This has to be it.

293
00:18:03,392 --> 00:18:04,861
Oh my God, it smells like weed.

294
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:31,420
Yo, what's up ladies?

295
00:18:31,453 --> 00:18:33,555
Or should I say girls?

296
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:34,624
Or should I say women?

297
00:18:34,657 --> 00:18:35,892
Is Stephanie here?

298
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:38,761
Stephanie is ocucpano,
if you know what I mean.

299
00:18:38,795 --> 00:18:41,831
We're here to submit our
crushes for the party tonight.

300
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:43,166
Party?

301
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:45,835
The crush party, it's
happening here tonight?

302
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:47,670
We sell great parties.

303
00:18:47,704 --> 00:18:49,571
You ladies wanna smoke?

304
00:18:49,605 --> 00:18:51,841
No, we're here to
submit our crush's name

305
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:54,476
in a box to make sure that
they're invited to the party

306
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,146
and to let them know that
someone else in the party

307
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,281
is interested in
them romantically.

308
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:00,583
What about Tinder?

309
00:19:02,952 --> 00:19:03,986
K, K?

310
00:19:07,824 --> 00:19:09,458
I matched with him on Tinder.

311
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:10,292
What?

312
00:19:12,762 --> 00:19:15,865
I couldn't find a pen but if
you write down your crushes,

313
00:19:15,898 --> 00:19:17,600
I'll make sure they
get to Stephanie.

314
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:18,433
In that?

315
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:51,399
Anuka, are
you submitting someone?

316
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:53,002
Yeah, just for fun.

317
00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:59,374
Do not tell me this is
my Phineas and Ferb DVD.

318
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,676
It is.

319
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,011
For six months, I've
been looking for this.

320
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:04,080
Please put it somewhere safe.

321
00:20:04,113 --> 00:20:05,882
And then Fifi, hand me the tens.

322
00:20:06,983 --> 00:20:08,751
We gotta do a count on that too.

323
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:09,919
Thank you.

324
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:12,521
Oh boy, that is heavy, God!

325
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:15,892
Hand me the fourteens.

326
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:19,862
- You kids lack mortals.
- Hmm hmm.

327
00:20:19,896 --> 00:20:24,200
You have
no scruples, at all.

328
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:25,333
Hmm hmm.

329
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:27,003
Bowlers, we gotta keep our
minds out of the gutters.

330
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:28,470
The red tape doesn't
belong in here.

331
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:29,404
Where's the, where's the...

332
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,140
- I...
- Oh here.

333
00:20:31,174 --> 00:20:31,974
Take that.

334
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:33,910
And take these.

335
00:20:34,977 --> 00:20:36,078
We gotta kid coming in.

336
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:37,512
Competitive, he's good.

337
00:20:38,948 --> 00:20:40,082
Are we really gonna
close College Lanes

338
00:20:40,116 --> 00:20:41,784
because of a stolen
pair of shoes?

339
00:21:03,172 --> 00:21:04,207
We can't close
College Lanes, okay.

340
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,708
I hated being a barista.

341
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:06,676
I hated it Tony.

342
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:07,977
I hated it.

343
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,846
See, where's
that passion been?

344
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:11,914
You're over here,
a kid tipping balls

345
00:21:11,948 --> 00:21:13,950
and then you're hopping
on the oil pushers.

346
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:14,851
What?

347
00:21:14,884 --> 00:21:16,152
The thing that
cleans the lanes.

348
00:21:16,185 --> 00:21:17,452
Oh.

349
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:18,888
I know it's fun, it's like
a Zamboni, but seriously.

350
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:20,422
Look at that.

351
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:22,859
My grandma painted that by hand.

352
00:21:22,892 --> 00:21:24,426
- We said, grandma, why?
- Why?

353
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:26,494
Why by hand, we'll do it,
we'll get decals, whatever.

354
00:21:26,528 --> 00:21:27,830
She said, un uh,
I'm gonna do it.

355
00:21:27,864 --> 00:21:29,198
We said, it doesn't match.

356
00:21:29,232 --> 00:21:30,532
Brown and yellow,
it doesn't match.

357
00:21:30,565 --> 00:21:31,466
No.

358
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,702
Said, I wanna do it in neon.

359
00:21:32,735 --> 00:21:34,237
That's become the fabric
of this whole place,

360
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,037
you see what I'm saying?

361
00:21:35,071 --> 00:21:36,538
I do.

362
00:21:36,571 --> 00:21:39,175
It's all cobbled together
with people like us,

363
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:43,145
but these, the shoes,
they keep it going.

364
00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:45,948
- Repeat after me.
- Okay.

365
00:21:45,982 --> 00:21:46,949
- We.
- We.

366
00:21:46,983 --> 00:21:47,917
- Won't.
- Won't.

367
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,252
- Lose.
- Lose.

368
00:21:49,285 --> 00:21:51,220
- Slow down.
- Sorry.

369
00:21:51,254 --> 00:21:53,122
- Any more.
- Any more.

370
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:55,091
- Shoes.
- Shoes, I will find them.

371
00:21:55,124 --> 00:21:56,424
- Go find the shoes.
- Okay.

372
00:22:01,197 --> 00:22:05,001
Uh hey, are you gonan be
studying all night, tonight?

373
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:07,303
She's on no astro diet.

374
00:22:07,336 --> 00:22:08,371
No more studying.

375
00:22:08,403 --> 00:22:11,107
Not totally no more studying.

376
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:14,944
So are you gonna be going to
any parties, tonight, maybe?

377
00:22:14,977 --> 00:22:16,979
The crush party.

378
00:22:17,013 --> 00:22:18,814
- At Big Blue.
- Cool.

379
00:22:18,848 --> 00:22:20,716
Cool, yeah, me too, actually.

380
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,684
Cool.

381
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,152
I don't usually go to parties.

382
00:22:23,185 --> 00:22:25,288
I usually stay in with
Paul and we watch videos.

383
00:22:25,321 --> 00:22:26,289
Yeah, I...

384
00:22:26,322 --> 00:22:27,690
Yeah, just these sort
of like sort of Russian

385
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:29,625
motorcycle accident videos.

386
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:31,193
There's like no road laws there.

387
00:22:33,329 --> 00:22:34,330
Phew!

388
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:39,201
Yeah, they're actually
pretty exhilarating.

389
00:22:48,443 --> 00:22:49,245
Cool.

390
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,214
I'll see you there, then.

391
00:22:52,248 --> 00:22:54,016
Yeah, no, I'll
probably see you later.

392
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,818
You don't wanna
get with this guy!

393
00:22:55,851 --> 00:22:57,186
He's gross!

394
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:58,988
Stop.

395
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:00,122
Dude, gross is in.

396
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:04,226
- Really?
- Yeah.

397
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,163
That boy is totally into you.

398
00:23:07,196 --> 00:23:08,563
You should flirt with him.

399
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:10,498
He's awkward.

400
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:13,336
And his friend literally
just said he's gross.

401
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:15,705
They're just messing with you.

402
00:23:15,738 --> 00:23:17,173
Here.

403
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,681
They took my gin.

404
00:23:25,715 --> 00:23:27,249
I didn't know they were
allowed to open the cabinets

405
00:23:27,283 --> 00:23:28,851
or anything.

406
00:23:28,884 --> 00:23:31,187
Would you have sex with
all these old people,

407
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,088
staring at you?

408
00:23:33,189 --> 00:23:34,390
They're not old people.

409
00:23:34,423 --> 00:23:37,727
Do you even know who
Vera Cooper Rubin is?

410
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,662
Literally, no one cares.

411
00:23:39,695 --> 00:23:41,330
She
discovered dark matter.

412
00:23:41,364 --> 00:23:44,467
How many people do you think
had sex on your mattress?

413
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:47,636
I can't do to this party
sober and we have five hours

414
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,138
to get alcohol and get drunk

415
00:23:49,171 --> 00:23:51,440
and my mom thinks
I'm 12 years old

416
00:23:51,474 --> 00:23:55,578
and sent me a single lollipop
in a box covered in hearts.

417
00:23:59,248 --> 00:24:01,050
You're freaking kidding me.

418
00:24:11,427 --> 00:24:14,363
Fiona, they took my
gin in room inspections.

419
00:24:14,397 --> 00:24:16,232
We're gonna go get
beer or something

420
00:24:16,265 --> 00:24:18,533
at the gas station, ugh.

421
00:24:18,566 --> 00:24:19,567
Crying emoji.

422
00:24:20,503 --> 00:24:22,138
Dude, that's so much alcohol.

423
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:23,472
Dude, shh, come on.

424
00:24:30,446 --> 00:24:31,647
Hi boys.

425
00:24:36,085 --> 00:24:37,119
Hi.

426
00:24:37,153 --> 00:24:39,688
You don't have
alcohol, do you?

427
00:24:47,263 --> 00:24:48,397
Will Lee?

428
00:24:50,565 --> 00:24:51,867
Yeah, Willy.

429
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:53,402
It says this time
that you're from uh,

430
00:24:53,436 --> 00:24:55,104
Dicksville, Arkansas.

431
00:24:55,137 --> 00:24:56,739
Yeah, yeah, Dicksville, yeah.

432
00:24:56,772 --> 00:24:58,541
Well, you have a good
time in Dicksville, okay.

433
00:24:58,573 --> 00:24:59,975
- Yeah, man.
- Not bad though.

434
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:01,343
- Respect, my dude.
- Yeah.

435
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:02,344
$8.50.

436
00:25:03,446 --> 00:25:04,346
Take care, yeah.

437
00:25:05,648 --> 00:25:06,849
Next.

438
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:08,918
- Just the ramens for ya?
- Yeah, just the ramen.

439
00:25:09,452 --> 00:25:11,187
Are you sure you don't want

440
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,988
a smell my nuts flavored candle?

441
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:17,093
No.

442
00:25:17,126 --> 00:25:18,127
Where you from?

443
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,762
- India.
- India, okay.

444
00:25:19,795 --> 00:25:21,130
Is it hot in India?

445
00:25:21,163 --> 00:25:22,798
'Cause I like it hot.

446
00:25:22,832 --> 00:25:23,632
Yeah.

447
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:24,500
What about you, young lady?

448
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:25,901
This is all?

449
00:25:25,935 --> 00:25:26,735
You have an ID?

450
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:52,895
So how is the weather
in um, in Apalachocola?

451
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:55,798
Nice, warmish.

452
00:25:55,831 --> 00:25:57,933
Warmish?

453
00:25:57,967 --> 00:25:58,767
Okay.

454
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,005
I don't think so my lady.

455
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:04,340
But I could give
you one of those

456
00:26:04,373 --> 00:26:06,375
smell my nuts flavored candles.

457
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:10,212
That was ridiculous.

458
00:26:10,246 --> 00:26:13,182
You're lucky that he
gave you your ID back.

459
00:26:13,215 --> 00:26:15,384
Fiona isn't even answering.

460
00:26:16,185 --> 00:26:17,386
Dear Isabelle,

461
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:19,655
I will be in my office
until nine this evening.

462
00:26:19,688 --> 00:26:23,325
Please come by with questions
and to review the materials.

463
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,429
You need at least 71% on
this test to pass the class.

464
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:29,965
I don't wanna see you fail.

465
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:32,468
And I highly suggest that
you come by to see me.

466
00:26:33,536 --> 00:26:36,238
I have some of Julius' weed.

467
00:26:36,272 --> 00:26:40,342
You know weed gives me
horrible panic attacks.

468
00:26:42,411 --> 00:26:44,246
I should just go
see my professor.

469
00:26:50,286 --> 00:26:51,420
Oh my God.

470
00:26:51,453 --> 00:26:53,255
Congratulations, hot stuff.

471
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:56,292
You've been crushed.

472
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:58,027
Somebody crushed me.

473
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,328
Who do you think crushed me?

474
00:26:59,361 --> 00:27:01,330
Tonight you get
to chase your crush.

475
00:27:01,363 --> 00:27:04,668
Wear pink and red and show
up at Big Blue by 11:00 p.m.

476
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,001
to get a heart.

477
00:27:06,035 --> 00:27:08,437
Only people who've been
crushed are allowed in.

478
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,272
See you then sexy.

479
00:27:10,306 --> 00:27:12,975
Winky face, smiley, Stephanie.

480
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:15,144
That guy is
peeing on that car.

481
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:17,780
You are a sex goddess.

482
00:27:17,813 --> 00:27:19,248
Come to the party tonight.

483
00:27:19,281 --> 00:27:20,416
You won't regret it.

484
00:27:20,449 --> 00:27:21,884
Don't you wanna succeed?

485
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:23,986
You don't wanna end your
freshman year still a virgin,

486
00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:24,920
do you?

487
00:27:24,954 --> 00:27:27,223
This is your future Isabelle.

488
00:27:32,094 --> 00:27:35,231
Ah, this is some
legit kinky stuff.

489
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:37,399
Oh my God.

490
00:27:37,433 --> 00:27:39,335
You should
not put those on.

491
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:43,405
Oh my God, just feeling
them makes you so nice.

492
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:46,242
It's like very sexual Jared.

493
00:27:46,275 --> 00:27:48,678
Kind of like it too much.

494
00:27:48,712 --> 00:27:50,714
Like very into this.

495
00:27:50,746 --> 00:27:52,114
Ah.

496
00:27:52,147 --> 00:27:53,482
Fiona, answer your phone.

497
00:27:53,515 --> 00:27:55,150
I just got crushed.

498
00:27:59,355 --> 00:28:02,458
Dispatch, put me on with
George George Victor, 1133.

499
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,880
I let you borrow mom's
car and this is what you do?

500
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:26,048
I thougth you were
gonna take pop pop

501
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:27,383
to the Midwest
succulent convention.

502
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:28,851
I'm really sorry
officer, you know,

503
00:28:28,884 --> 00:28:31,387
I just thought these were
like kinky handcuffs,

504
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,956
like for sex not for jail.

505
00:28:33,989 --> 00:28:34,758
And I...

506
00:28:35,991 --> 00:28:36,792
Sorry.

507
00:28:37,893 --> 00:28:39,696
Okay.

508
00:28:40,697 --> 00:28:41,698
Thank you.

509
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:46,636
J, when you're
behind the wheel,

510
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,638
you need to be aware of
everything around you.

511
00:28:48,672 --> 00:28:50,105
We're all fishes.

512
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:51,641
You need to watch out for
all of them around you.

513
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:52,908
Dad!

514
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:54,209
No, you're gonna
let me finish.

515
00:28:54,243 --> 00:28:56,512
Don't move, I'll
be right there.

516
00:28:59,248 --> 00:29:03,352
Hello, I found alcohol
ladies, let's go shall we?

517
00:29:03,385 --> 00:29:05,287
Fiona, who
are these children

518
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:06,822
and where are they taking us?

519
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:08,190
Izzy, don't worry about it.

520
00:29:08,223 --> 00:29:10,392
If we die
tonight, it's on you.

521
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:21,437
All right, just
a little bit further.

522
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,639
Where are we going?

523
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:27,677
Oh wow.

524
00:29:28,745 --> 00:29:29,511
Yeah.

525
00:29:31,614 --> 00:29:33,616
I hated
high school, you know.

526
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,983
Everyone thought I
was a middle schooler,

527
00:29:35,017 --> 00:29:36,720
'cause I had my braces on still.

528
00:29:36,753 --> 00:29:38,454
It's a hard time.

529
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:39,922
Well, don't worry...

530
00:29:39,955 --> 00:29:42,524
In the beginning, about
13 billion years ago,

531
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:45,729
all the space, matter and
energy of the known universe

532
00:29:45,762 --> 00:29:48,665
was contained in the volume
of a single pinpoint.

533
00:29:48,698 --> 00:29:50,399
The diversity of life on Earth.

534
00:29:54,804 --> 00:29:56,773
Don't you want to succeed.

535
00:29:56,806 --> 00:29:59,375
Lose your virginity
another time.

536
00:29:59,408 --> 00:30:01,910
This is your future, Isabelle.

537
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,481
Izzy, you'll do fine.

538
00:30:06,683 --> 00:30:08,651
I should have gone
to see my professor.

539
00:30:08,685 --> 00:30:11,553
Well, maybe you're
not the next Carl Sagan.

540
00:30:11,588 --> 00:30:12,955
- Sagan.
- Sagan.

541
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,659
You're Izzy Alden.

542
00:30:16,693 --> 00:30:18,795
You're smart, committed.

543
00:30:18,828 --> 00:30:20,129
And you'll do fine,

544
00:30:20,162 --> 00:30:23,432
even if you study all
night tonight or not.

545
00:30:23,465 --> 00:30:25,635
Let's play, never have I ever.

546
00:30:25,668 --> 00:30:27,569
If you've done it, you drink.

547
00:30:27,604 --> 00:30:30,874
Never have I ever
been in a threesome.

548
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:32,609
Oh.

549
00:30:33,743 --> 00:30:35,612
Bullshit, Emerson.

550
00:30:35,645 --> 00:30:37,045
You don't know my life Jared.

551
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,983
Two boys or two girls?

552
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,286
- Both.
- Oh.

553
00:30:45,521 --> 00:30:46,723
Even
though you don't see it

554
00:30:46,756 --> 00:30:48,825
or feel it, touch
it or taste it,

555
00:30:48,858 --> 00:30:50,627
smell it or even sense it,

556
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,262
does not mean it does not exist.

557
00:30:53,295 --> 00:30:56,465
Part of why we have
science at all is to decode

558
00:30:56,498 --> 00:30:59,736
that which is true in nature
that otherwise transcends

559
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:01,103
our sensory perceptions.

560
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:04,774
- Fiona!
- Fiona!

561
00:31:09,311 --> 00:31:10,279
Yes.

562
00:31:12,715 --> 00:31:14,049
- Let's go.
- Okay, okay.

563
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:15,852
- Oh Izzy.
- I'll be your driver.

564
00:31:15,885 --> 00:31:18,855
Izzy, you're
a terrible driver.

565
00:31:18,888 --> 00:31:19,823
You don't
have a license.

566
00:31:19,856 --> 00:31:21,691
You're all too drunk.

567
00:31:21,724 --> 00:31:25,527
You
will not be a statistic.

568
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,832
What you doing?

569
00:31:28,865 --> 00:31:33,302
She's grounding herself.

570
00:31:33,335 --> 00:31:37,473
Just feel the wheel on your
sexy little fingertips, okay.

571
00:31:37,506 --> 00:31:39,475
You're ready for takeoff.

572
00:31:39,508 --> 00:31:42,077
You're like a sexy
car astronaut.

573
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:48,083
Come Izzy, floor it.

574
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,118
We gotta get you on
the way to boneville.

575
00:31:50,152 --> 00:31:51,821
Bone, bone, boneville!

576
00:31:51,855 --> 00:31:53,823
- Boneville, bone...
- Would you stop?

577
00:31:56,024 --> 00:31:57,559
Um, just
go a little faster.

578
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:05,334
Okay, so we get back, get
changed and go to Big Blue.

579
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:07,937
Just focus on the road Izzy.

580
00:32:07,971 --> 00:32:09,606
Can you tell me who it's from?

581
00:32:11,808 --> 00:32:13,676
Your mom just texted.

582
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:17,546
She said, Izz, did
you get my package?

583
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,949
Just a little end of
the year celebration.

584
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:25,622
She sent a photo
of herself with,

585
00:32:26,756 --> 00:32:27,991
a joint?

586
00:32:28,023 --> 00:32:29,525
Okay, your mom is hot.

587
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:30,559
Is that all she said?

588
00:32:30,593 --> 00:32:32,862
My dad got a thing for her.

589
00:32:32,896 --> 00:32:34,129
Who?

590
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:36,365
Shit.

591
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:38,133
Oh, it's my dad again.

592
00:32:42,404 --> 00:32:43,372
Who's that?

593
00:32:46,676 --> 00:32:48,611
Oh my God,
no, no, no, no, no.

594
00:32:53,016 --> 00:32:56,719
J, what in the hell is
she doing driving mom's car?

595
00:32:56,753 --> 00:32:58,621
You lose soda pop
privileges for two weeks.

596
00:32:58,655 --> 00:33:01,223
That's not fair, dad you
can't even pull people over.

597
00:33:01,256 --> 00:33:02,759
You see this badge Jared?

598
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:03,993
If you're being a safety threat,

599
00:33:04,027 --> 00:33:06,729
which this young lady,
going 15 in a 35,

600
00:33:06,763 --> 00:33:07,630
I most certainly can.

601
00:33:07,664 --> 00:33:08,631
Sorry officer.

602
00:33:08,665 --> 00:33:09,933
Can I see some ID please?

603
00:33:09,966 --> 00:33:11,433
You're not a cop.

604
00:33:28,818 --> 00:33:30,118
Apalachocola?

605
00:33:32,822 --> 00:33:33,690
We've got cousins there.

606
00:33:33,723 --> 00:33:35,992
Ah, yeah.

607
00:33:37,594 --> 00:33:38,828
Nice weather.

608
00:33:38,861 --> 00:33:40,462
I gotta make it
down there sometime.

609
00:33:40,495 --> 00:33:41,764
J, put gas in the car.

610
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:02,250
Ah, I just
feel so good right now.

611
00:34:02,284 --> 00:34:04,353
So that
was my gin they were drinking.

612
00:34:04,386 --> 00:34:05,788
I gotta shower.

613
00:34:07,624 --> 00:34:08,858
Okay, I'm gonna go change

614
00:34:08,891 --> 00:34:10,827
and I'll meet you
in the playground.

615
00:34:13,062 --> 00:34:15,397
They faked the
room inspections.

616
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:20,870
All that alcohol you were
drinking, was stolen.

617
00:34:20,903 --> 00:34:24,641
Um, and Elise's boots?

618
00:34:26,241 --> 00:34:28,077
I'll give them back.

619
00:34:28,111 --> 00:34:28,911
Ah huh.

620
00:34:36,586 --> 00:34:38,253
Nolan Wiles, hmm.

621
00:34:39,554 --> 00:34:41,156
I have a lot of
pictures of me smiling.

622
00:34:41,189 --> 00:34:43,059
But taken with
cool film cameras.

623
00:34:43,092 --> 00:34:46,495
It's a good combination
of hip, but approachable.

624
00:34:46,528 --> 00:34:47,797
I have a big trust fund

625
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:50,165
but my most expensive
item of clothing?

626
00:34:50,198 --> 00:34:51,634
$30.

627
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:53,936
I also do a lot of
promotion for my band page.

628
00:34:54,804 --> 00:34:56,271
I just added him for you.

629
00:34:57,339 --> 00:34:59,776
You love pretentious boys.

630
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:01,309
Does my make up look okay?

631
00:35:02,578 --> 00:35:04,814
No, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

632
00:35:04,847 --> 00:35:08,017
You deep like when
he accepts, okay?

633
00:35:09,384 --> 00:35:10,419
Oh my God.

634
00:35:10,452 --> 00:35:12,387
His band is called Cut Loose.

Here, wear these.

650
00:35:57,133 --> 00:36:00,903
But, you know I'm not like
into big jewelry and stuff.

651
00:36:02,004 --> 00:36:03,005
Just wear them.

652
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:04,807
They're for good luck.

653
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:08,177
They were a part of my
great grandmother's dowry.

654
00:36:08,211 --> 00:36:09,645
And you know the rubies,

655
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:11,114
they came from the red cells

656
00:36:11,147 --> 00:36:12,982
of her mother's father's.

657
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,987
It's like my great
grandparents soul

658
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,756
is preserved in these,

659
00:36:19,789 --> 00:36:22,524
soon to be followed
by my grandparents

660
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:24,961
and my parents and then me.

661
00:36:24,994 --> 00:36:26,394
Is that an Indian tradition,

662
00:36:26,428 --> 00:36:28,998
trapping your
ancestor's in jewelry?

663
00:36:29,932 --> 00:36:31,768
Just wear them.

664
00:36:31,801 --> 00:36:34,971
I wore them when I took
my SAT's and I got 2360.

665
00:36:36,538 --> 00:36:37,305
Here.

666
00:36:39,075 --> 00:36:40,076
Nana Deelep.

667
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:43,746
And Nani Meena.

668
00:36:45,915 --> 00:36:46,883
Will guide you tonight.

669
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:49,786
Okay, let's go.

670
00:36:53,823 --> 00:36:55,457
Will you
ever get a bag?

671
00:37:00,328 --> 00:37:02,031
One sec, I forgot something.

672
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,967
Tell Fiona that
we're heading out.

673
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:11,140
Hey, you still coming tonight?

674
00:37:14,076 --> 00:37:14,944
Yeah!

675
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:29,524
Izzy matched with JuJu?

676
00:37:31,828 --> 00:37:32,995
Last night was fun.

677
00:37:33,029 --> 00:37:34,030
Wanna hang again?

678
00:37:51,881 --> 00:37:53,950
Okay, I'm ready.

679
00:37:53,983 --> 00:37:55,184
Is Fiona meeting us there?

680
00:37:55,218 --> 00:37:56,886
I bet she's already at
Big Blue and making out

681
00:37:56,919 --> 00:37:58,553
with Elise on the dance floor.

682
00:37:59,354 --> 00:38:00,122
You coming?

683
00:38:01,691 --> 00:38:02,925
Yeah.

684
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:04,093
You okay?

685
00:38:05,328 --> 00:38:06,062
Yeah.

686
00:38:07,864 --> 00:38:09,732
Take your phone back.

687
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:13,936
- Just wait.
- Okay.

688
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,438
Make sure that I don't
chicken out, okay.

689
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:17,372
Who do you think crushed me?

690
00:38:17,405 --> 00:38:18,373
Do you think Nolan crushed me?

691
00:38:18,406 --> 00:38:19,809
Oh my God, if Nolan crushed me,

692
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:21,811
my heart is going to explode.

693
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:25,147
- God, I'm so nervous.
- Hmm hmm.

694
00:38:29,986 --> 00:38:32,955
This isn't even the right place.

695
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:33,789
No shit.

696
00:38:35,224 --> 00:38:36,626
They're gonna stop letting
people into the crush party

697
00:38:36,659 --> 00:38:37,927
in 12 minutes.

698
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,896
Of course, they only
had to say Big Blue.

699
00:38:39,929 --> 00:38:42,031
That's not even an address.

700
00:38:42,064 --> 00:38:45,334
Does anyone here feel that
we're a part of a big joke?

701
00:38:52,108 --> 00:38:55,945
Izzy, it's not a
great disappointment.

702
00:38:55,978 --> 00:38:57,479
Everything happens for a reason.

703
00:39:00,983 --> 00:39:02,018
Hot.

704
00:39:15,097 --> 00:39:17,867
Hello Instagram friends.

705
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,170
This is Fiona, I just
wanted to update you all.

706
00:39:21,203 --> 00:39:24,006
I am alive and
alone in this park.

707
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,809
And I'm going to the party.

708
00:39:26,842 --> 00:39:29,145
Hmm, I don't like that.

709
00:39:38,621 --> 00:39:39,355
Oh my God.

710
00:39:43,826 --> 00:39:45,094
LOL, nice.

711
00:39:45,127 --> 00:39:46,862
You going to the
crush party later?

712
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,935
- Please don't.
- I actually don't know.

713
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:54,170
But I'm gonna trust
you on this one.

714
00:39:54,203 --> 00:39:56,205
Again, don't let me
down and let's go.

715
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:00,943
Hey, uh, how's the
not studying going?

716
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:04,013
I think I'm gonna go.

717
00:40:04,046 --> 00:40:05,480
No, wait.

718
00:40:05,513 --> 00:40:07,383
- Uh, have...
- Sorry.

719
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:09,418
Guys, my friend Paul.

720
00:40:11,988 --> 00:40:14,357
He's one of the nicest
guys I've ever, ever met.

721
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,058
He's actually very
trendy as well.

722
00:40:16,092 --> 00:40:17,460
He's kidding.

723
00:40:18,995 --> 00:40:20,629
But seriously,
this guy is great.

724
00:40:20,663 --> 00:40:21,731
I mean if I were you.

725
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:25,567
Um, are you going
to Big Blue later?

726
00:40:27,937 --> 00:40:29,638
We got lost.

727
00:40:29,672 --> 00:40:30,572
It's just down the hill.

728
00:40:30,606 --> 00:40:31,807
We'll get you there in time.

729
00:40:33,242 --> 00:40:35,011
- Okay, one.
- Ah!

730
00:40:35,044 --> 00:40:36,178
Two.

731
00:40:40,282 --> 00:40:42,118
Every
one of our body's atoms

732
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:44,253
is traceable to the Big Bang.

733
00:40:44,286 --> 00:40:46,355
We are made of star matter.

734
00:40:46,389 --> 00:40:48,657
We are not simply
in the universe.

735
00:40:48,691 --> 00:40:50,126
We are a part of it.

736
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,761
We are born.

737
00:40:51,794 --> 00:40:54,830
You might even say we've been
empowered by the universe

738
00:40:54,864 --> 00:40:58,167
to figure it out and
we've only just begun.

739
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:07,977
Oh my God, Izzy.

740
00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:21,090
Are you okay?

741
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:25,861
Deelep and Meena,
they saved me.

742
00:41:27,797 --> 00:41:28,731
Uh, okay.

743
00:41:28,764 --> 00:41:29,532
Let me just.

744
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,135
Whoa, oh my God,
that's so sweet.

745
00:41:33,169 --> 00:41:35,237
Thank you so much.

746
00:41:35,271 --> 00:41:36,172
What time is it?

747
00:41:38,274 --> 00:41:39,241
It's 10:57.

748
00:41:39,275 --> 00:41:40,509
Three minutes, hmm!

749
00:41:42,378 --> 00:41:44,113
Sorry about your skateboard.

750
00:41:44,146 --> 00:41:46,949
Sorry, she's
embarrassing sometimes.

751
00:41:46,982 --> 00:41:48,117
Dude.

752
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:50,152
She breaks your board.

753
00:41:50,186 --> 00:41:51,520
What's next, your heart?

754
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:55,758
This isn't a Soviet film,
this is your life, man.

755
00:41:56,792 --> 00:41:57,660
Can you shut up?

756
00:41:58,928 --> 00:42:02,064
So frustrating.

757
00:42:02,098 --> 00:42:05,134
That no one takes my art
seriously because I'm an athlete.

758
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:10,506
- Izzy.
- Ah, I feel really weird.

759
00:42:10,539 --> 00:42:13,409
Izzy, you're fine, okay.

760
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:15,111
I have have to go.

761
00:42:16,078 --> 00:42:17,246
You're now will be here soon.

762
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,649
Georgie messaged you on Tinder.

763
00:42:20,683 --> 00:42:21,917
So flirt with him.

764
00:42:22,818 --> 00:42:23,853
Yeah?

765
00:42:23,886 --> 00:42:25,955
I'm gonna go.

766
00:42:25,988 --> 00:42:27,056
What?

767
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:38,334
Hello, I've been crushed.

768
00:42:41,303 --> 00:42:42,938
Excuse me, sorry.

769
00:42:42,972 --> 00:42:43,772
Izzy.

770
00:42:44,707 --> 00:42:46,742
Isabelle Alden.

771
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:50,679
A-L-D-E-N, like Baldwin
but not Baldwin.

772
00:42:55,518 --> 00:42:56,318
Just kidding.

773
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,535
Enjoy.

774
00:43:13,469 --> 00:43:15,271
Can I have some of your water?

775
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,040
What the fuck
happened to the music?

776
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:23,580
There's a cooler
art party down the street.

777
00:43:23,613 --> 00:43:24,914
Let's go to the that.

778
00:43:24,947 --> 00:43:26,248
Come on
guys, come back to ours.

779
00:43:26,282 --> 00:43:27,651
No music.

780
00:43:27,683 --> 00:43:28,984
Don't
make fun of this kid,

781
00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:30,052
he doesn't know what he's doing.

782
00:43:30,085 --> 00:43:31,655
God, okay.

783
00:43:37,226 --> 00:43:39,361
Ah, thank you so much.

784
00:43:39,395 --> 00:43:40,696
Yeah, so I don't know.

785
00:43:40,729 --> 00:43:42,064
It's always just been
like a personal dream

786
00:43:42,097 --> 00:43:44,200
of mine to like break
the sound barrier,

787
00:43:44,233 --> 00:43:47,236
jet plane, you
know, Mach 3 or 4.

788
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:48,270
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

789
00:43:48,304 --> 00:43:49,505
Like Speed Runner.

790
00:43:49,538 --> 00:43:50,806
I'm inside alone.

791
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:52,576
I don't know what to do.

792
00:43:52,609 --> 00:43:54,243
What, you're already there?

793
00:43:54,276 --> 00:43:55,044
Where's Anuka?

794
00:43:55,077 --> 00:43:56,512
She left.

795
00:43:56,545 --> 00:43:58,380
I've been waiting for
you guys at the playground.

796
00:43:58,414 --> 00:43:59,148
Why?

797
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:00,716
Eh, whatever.

798
00:44:00,749 --> 00:44:02,051
We didn't have sex.

799
00:44:02,084 --> 00:44:03,385
Running man emoji.

800
00:44:03,419 --> 00:44:05,287
- Break the sound barrier.
- Hmm hmm.

801
00:44:05,321 --> 00:44:10,025
Apparently, cum travels
at 65 miles an hour

802
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:11,393
which when I found that out,

803
00:44:11,427 --> 00:44:13,630
I'm just like so
scared.

804
00:44:13,663 --> 00:44:15,064
- Wow, that's crazy.
- Yeah.

805
00:44:15,097 --> 00:44:16,600
That's not possible.

806
00:44:18,267 --> 00:44:22,606
That's like double the speed
limit on Main Street, so.

807
00:44:24,006 --> 00:44:25,007
- Oh.
- Yeah.

808
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,542
- Yeah.
- Okay.

809
00:44:26,576 --> 00:44:27,810
- Anyways.
- Yeah, it's like.

810
00:44:27,843 --> 00:44:28,944
Yeah.

811
00:44:28,978 --> 00:44:30,580
But I heard it's even
faster if you eat celery.

812
00:44:58,708 --> 00:44:59,508
Thanks.

813
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:02,144
It should work now.

814
00:45:18,595 --> 00:45:19,461
I like your shirt.

815
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:22,264
Thanks, it was my grandpa's.

816
00:45:22,298 --> 00:45:23,600
He was the music producer

817
00:45:23,633 --> 00:45:25,901
of some Christian
Death Metal group.

818
00:45:25,934 --> 00:45:28,738
My grandpa was in
the music industry.

819
00:45:28,772 --> 00:45:29,938
Woe, sick shoes.

820
00:45:32,474 --> 00:45:34,243
Hey, you wanna
help me DJ, make out,

821
00:45:34,276 --> 00:45:36,211
then go home together
and have romantic sex

822
00:45:36,245 --> 00:45:37,880
on my twin Xl bed?

823
00:45:37,913 --> 00:45:40,717
I would love to have
romantic sex with you

824
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,585
on your twin XL bed.

825
00:45:52,528 --> 00:45:53,395
I like your shirt.

826
00:45:53,429 --> 00:45:54,664
What?

827
00:45:54,698 --> 00:45:56,633
I like your shirt,
what does it say?

828
00:45:57,499 --> 00:45:58,567
What?

829
00:45:58,601 --> 00:45:59,535
What does it say?

830
00:46:01,103 --> 00:46:02,571
Your shirt.

831
00:46:02,605 --> 00:46:04,940
I don't know, I got
it at a thrift store.

832
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:07,443
Oh, cool!

833
00:46:07,476 --> 00:46:09,713
I have a lot of those too.

834
00:46:09,746 --> 00:46:10,946
Yeah, cool.

835
00:46:35,537 --> 00:46:36,606
Have eye sex

836
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:39,007
with someone on the dance floor.

837
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:41,477
Deep
like one of his photos.

838
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:42,645
You don't wanna end

839
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:44,614
your freshman year
still a virgin, do you?

840
00:46:46,014 --> 00:46:47,449
Hey, you made it?

841
00:46:47,483 --> 00:46:48,951
Yeah.

842
00:46:48,984 --> 00:46:50,854
You smell great.

843
00:46:50,886 --> 00:46:51,887
Thanks.

844
00:47:05,735 --> 00:47:07,069
What
you up too buddy?

845
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:09,405
I'm not at a party.

846
00:47:10,372 --> 00:47:11,240
Are you smoking?

847
00:47:13,308 --> 00:47:14,209
It's not lit.

848
00:47:17,179 --> 00:47:18,848
Uh, how's the party?

849
00:47:18,882 --> 00:47:20,349
Not lit, either.

850
00:47:23,419 --> 00:47:25,487
Wait, JuJu, you're frozen.

851
00:47:27,456 --> 00:47:28,424
You need a light?

852
00:47:34,697 --> 00:47:35,464
Um.

853
00:47:36,766 --> 00:47:38,400
Can I call you back?

854
00:47:38,434 --> 00:47:39,501
Wait, wait, who's that?

855
00:47:39,535 --> 00:47:40,536
- Bye.
- Who's that guy...

856
00:47:43,907 --> 00:47:45,708
I'm trying to quit, so.

857
00:47:45,742 --> 00:47:47,577
So, you fake smoke at parties?

858
00:47:48,544 --> 00:47:49,978
You mind if I join you for one?

859
00:47:50,012 --> 00:47:51,280
Um hmm.

860
00:47:51,313 --> 00:47:52,114
Anuka, right?

861
00:47:53,315 --> 00:47:54,950
Yeah.

862
00:47:54,983 --> 00:47:57,453
So uh, who's JuJu?

863
00:47:59,254 --> 00:48:01,256
My boyfriend, I guess.

864
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:02,090
I guess?

865
00:48:05,628 --> 00:48:07,463
Wait, how come
you're not inside?

866
00:48:08,598 --> 00:48:10,767
I wasn't crushed.

867
00:48:12,669 --> 00:48:14,036
What do you mean?

868
00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:16,538
I mean, that
nobody crushed me.

869
00:48:17,907 --> 00:48:21,276
Wait so if you weren't
crushed, that means.

870
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,715
Izzy got crushed for real.

871
00:48:29,919 --> 00:48:32,655
What?

872
00:48:32,689 --> 00:48:34,657
Wait, you weren't
crushed for real?

873
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:36,525
Well, you
don't have to rub it in.

874
00:48:36,558 --> 00:48:37,326
No.

875
00:48:39,194 --> 00:48:40,162
Sorry.

876
00:49:25,374 --> 00:49:28,310
I just feel like your background
deserves more than this.

877
00:49:29,846 --> 00:49:31,280
Like.

878
00:49:31,313 --> 00:49:33,883
- Your cultural...
- Oh!

879
00:49:33,917 --> 00:49:36,786
So you mean, I should
put all the Hindu gods

880
00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:37,921
all over the place?

881
00:49:37,954 --> 00:49:39,254
- No, I mean...
- No.

882
00:49:39,288 --> 00:49:41,423
Just like if this
is a self-portrait.

883
00:49:41,456 --> 00:49:43,693
Yeah, which is ugly
because I am ugly.

884
00:49:43,726 --> 00:49:44,560
- No.
- No.

885
00:49:44,594 --> 00:49:46,328
What?

886
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:49,531
Uh, it just doesn't seem
as unique as you do.

887
00:49:49,565 --> 00:49:51,166
It's okay.

888
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:53,937
I, look, I've just seen
some stuff like this before.

889
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:57,539
Oh.

890
00:49:57,573 --> 00:49:59,709
I can be kind of
an asshole, I know.

891
00:49:59,742 --> 00:50:01,644
Yeah, I've heard that.

892
00:50:01,678 --> 00:50:02,579
- Yeah?
- Hmm hmm.

893
00:50:02,612 --> 00:50:04,146
What have you heard?

894
00:50:04,179 --> 00:50:07,650
That you wrote a
sexist crossword puzzle

895
00:50:07,684 --> 00:50:09,619
in a newspaper or something.

896
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,589
All right, I didn't even
think it was that bad.

897
00:50:12,622 --> 00:50:13,856
Oh.

898
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:16,793
The clue was the
skin around the vagina

899
00:50:16,826 --> 00:50:18,527
for a five letter word.

900
00:50:20,597 --> 00:50:21,598
Labia?

901
00:50:23,265 --> 00:50:24,067
Woman.

902
00:50:25,635 --> 00:50:28,805
I guess it incorporates my
cis, straight white male,

903
00:50:28,838 --> 00:50:30,673
privilege background
pretty nicely.

904
00:50:30,707 --> 00:50:32,240
Hmm hmm, definitely.

905
00:50:35,177 --> 00:50:36,478
Ew, JuJu?

906
00:50:39,214 --> 00:50:40,515
Hi.

907
00:50:40,549 --> 00:50:42,051
Izzy said you left?

908
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:47,289
- Hey, I'm Fiona.
- Hey, I'm Rex.

909
00:50:47,322 --> 00:50:48,625
Yeah, I know who you are.

910
00:50:48,658 --> 00:50:50,559
You're the vagina man.

911
00:50:52,829 --> 00:50:53,663
Um, where's Izzy?

912
00:50:53,696 --> 00:50:54,931
Inside.

913
00:50:54,964 --> 00:50:57,634
Oh, Izzy's on her
way to bonetown.

914
00:50:58,801 --> 00:51:02,137
Welcome, welcome
to the bonetown.

915
00:51:03,606 --> 00:51:04,941
No, you don't know that song?

916
00:51:04,974 --> 00:51:06,743
Nope, no I don't, do you.

917
00:51:06,776 --> 00:51:07,777
Hmm hmm, no.

918
00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:09,244
Hmm, that's fine.

919
00:51:09,277 --> 00:51:12,015
Have you seen Elise,
'cause she slummed my DM's.

920
00:51:12,048 --> 00:51:14,651
Well, she's probably inside.

921
00:51:14,684 --> 00:51:17,519
But they won't let you
in if you're not crushed.

922
00:51:17,552 --> 00:51:19,154
They won't let
me in if I'm not,

923
00:51:19,187 --> 00:51:20,155
what are you talking about?

924
00:51:20,188 --> 00:51:21,456
Let's just go through a window.

925
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:39,307
- Is this really necessary?
- Yes.

926
00:51:43,445 --> 00:51:44,947
Hey you guys,

927
00:51:44,981 --> 00:51:47,416
we can just get in
through the back door?

928
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:48,785
What!

929
00:51:52,822 --> 00:51:54,523
You know, I'm not gay, right?

930
00:51:55,357 --> 00:51:57,192
No, not me either.

931
00:51:57,225 --> 00:51:58,360
Okay, good.

932
00:53:19,041 --> 00:53:19,809
Shit!

933
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:21,978
Shit.

934
00:53:25,615 --> 00:53:28,017
They were a part of my
great grandmother's dowry.

935
00:53:29,518 --> 00:53:33,756
My great grandparents soul
is preserved in these.

936
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:35,792
Soon to be followed
by my grandparents

937
00:53:36,926 --> 00:53:38,426
and my parents and then me.

938
00:53:39,762 --> 00:53:40,630
Come on grandma.

939
00:53:43,065 --> 00:53:44,432
Tell me where grandpa is.

940
00:53:52,275 --> 00:53:53,142
One sec.

941
00:54:06,889 --> 00:54:07,857
I thought you left.

942
00:54:08,991 --> 00:54:10,293
I made out with Georgie.

943
00:54:10,325 --> 00:54:12,128
He smelled like a
kitty litter box.

944
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:13,328
Cool.

945
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,168
Wait, are you?

946
00:54:19,202 --> 00:54:22,305
Hey, hey, hey,
Nolan's over there.

947
00:54:22,337 --> 00:54:24,539
Go and make out with him.

948
00:54:24,573 --> 00:54:26,175
I already made
a fool of myself.

949
00:54:26,209 --> 00:54:27,777
Izzy, come on.

950
00:54:27,810 --> 00:54:29,679
I'm gonna find Elise, just
go make out with Nolan.

951
00:54:29,712 --> 00:54:31,513
Okay, please, yes, thank you.

952
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:30,172
All right,
gig's up folks.

953
00:55:30,206 --> 00:55:32,407
Too many noise complaints.

954
00:56:06,008 --> 00:56:08,044
Anuka, someone crushed me.

955
00:56:35,104 --> 00:56:36,272
Did you guys leave?

956
00:56:47,316 --> 00:56:48,317
Izzy?

957
00:56:48,351 --> 00:56:51,120
Hey Izzy, aw, are you okay?

958
00:56:51,153 --> 00:56:53,089
Dispatch,
put me at the house party.

959
00:56:54,156 --> 00:56:55,490
Fiona, those are my shoes!

960
00:56:55,523 --> 00:56:57,360
Your friend has my shoes.

961
00:56:57,393 --> 00:56:58,160
What the fuck!

962
00:56:58,194 --> 00:56:59,595
She vomited on them.

963
00:56:59,628 --> 00:57:01,964
You took those
from the bowling alley

964
00:57:01,998 --> 00:57:03,132
and didn't tell me?

965
00:57:03,165 --> 00:57:04,767
You knew I got in trouble?

966
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,635
You have
this young lady's shoes?

967
00:57:07,703 --> 00:57:09,171
Give me my shoes back.

968
00:57:09,205 --> 00:57:10,706
That's actually psychotic?

969
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:11,907
You realize that
you're the reason

970
00:57:11,941 --> 00:57:13,376
I might get fired right,

971
00:57:13,409 --> 00:57:15,044
like you're the reason
College Lanes might close.

972
00:57:15,077 --> 00:57:16,345
You know, I love
working there Izzy.

973
00:57:16,379 --> 00:57:18,214
I got a whole lecture today.

974
00:57:19,782 --> 00:57:23,019
I guess you should have stayed
at home and studied.

975
00:57:25,154 --> 00:57:26,554
I think maybe you
should come with me

976
00:57:26,589 --> 00:57:28,391
and sober up a little
bit young lady.

977
00:57:40,236 --> 00:57:42,705
I love y'all like you're
my own but you're a lot.

978
00:57:43,873 --> 00:57:44,774
You a freshman?

979
00:57:44,807 --> 00:57:46,075
I have a speech for freshmen

980
00:57:46,108 --> 00:57:47,476
who don't their
substance limits.

981
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:48,778
I like to remind you kids

982
00:57:48,811 --> 00:57:50,946
that the world ain't
easy all the time.

983
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:52,214
You're all just fishes.

984
00:57:52,248 --> 00:57:54,850
Swimming upstream, fins
against the current.

985
00:57:54,884 --> 00:57:56,551
When you're in college,
it's easy to forget

986
00:57:56,585 --> 00:57:59,055
that we're all just a school
of fish who are people.

987
00:57:59,088 --> 00:58:01,090
On this Earth for
different reasons

988
00:58:01,123 --> 00:58:02,758
but swimming in the same waters.

989
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,062
Izzy, 19.

990
00:58:06,095 --> 00:58:08,030
I have a decent Yelp review.

991
00:58:08,064 --> 00:58:09,465
Look me up.

992
00:58:09,498 --> 00:58:13,568
Cat emoji, heart emoji,
smiling poop face emoji.

993
00:58:13,602 --> 00:58:15,805
I seem like the biggest weirdo.

994
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,909
Most important,

995
00:58:19,942 --> 00:58:20,843
love yourself.

996
00:58:21,944 --> 00:58:23,212
Keep that love somewhere
around your mind

997
00:58:23,245 --> 00:58:25,114
like a love fish.

998
00:58:25,147 --> 00:58:26,382
He's a slippery fellow.

999
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:29,085
But if you ever find
yourself lost or unsure,

1000
00:58:29,118 --> 00:58:31,187
just try catching that
love fish and hold on tight

1001
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,254
and don't let go.

1002
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,396
Oh shoot, I'm sorry.

1003
00:58:41,664 --> 00:58:43,232
I thought today
would be the night

1004
00:58:43,265 --> 00:58:47,203
I had to leap and mean
it and they're souls

1005
00:58:47,236 --> 00:58:49,138
and they're good
luck but not for me.

1006
00:58:49,171 --> 00:58:51,340
My friends, they don't get it

1007
00:58:51,373 --> 00:58:54,343
because it's never
been hard for them.

1008
00:58:54,376 --> 00:58:57,012
They just look at a guy

1009
00:58:57,046 --> 00:58:58,948
and he comes to
them and that's it.

1010
00:59:00,449 --> 00:59:02,485
They're kissing and hanging out

1011
00:59:02,518 --> 00:59:06,755
and holding stupid hands
and watching stupid movies

1012
00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:08,224
and laughing at stupid jokes

1013
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:11,694
and all that other stupid,
cute shit that I want.

1014
00:59:11,727 --> 00:59:14,163
I'm sorry, I was just
talking about self love.

1015
00:59:14,196 --> 00:59:15,698
I'm so cool.

1016
00:59:15,731 --> 00:59:18,267
Like what is the
reason for all of this?

1017
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,069
Like honestly, I
have a good body.

1018
00:59:20,102 --> 00:59:23,139
And my dad always said that
I had a good sense of humor

1019
00:59:23,172 --> 00:59:25,508
and I know that there
are like worse things

1020
00:59:25,541 --> 00:59:26,675
in the world to worry about

1021
00:59:26,709 --> 00:59:28,310
so I try not to think about.

1022
00:59:28,344 --> 00:59:29,845
They're too much,
I get too upset.

1023
00:59:29,879 --> 00:59:33,816
But I just really, wanted
to like finally have sex!

1024
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,468
Can I have some gum?

1025
00:59:54,303 --> 00:59:55,704
Yeah, sure.

1026
00:59:55,738 --> 00:59:56,539
Thanks.

1027
00:59:59,441 --> 01:00:01,110
And then I gave my
roommate back his first suit

1028
01:00:01,143 --> 01:00:02,344
Guys, wait up.

1029
01:00:02,378 --> 01:00:04,380
After I got it dry
cleaned of course.

1030
01:00:04,413 --> 01:00:06,182
And uh.

1031
01:00:08,585 --> 01:00:11,020
I'm sorry.

1032
01:00:11,053 --> 01:00:13,189
Um, do you know where Izzy is?

1033
01:00:15,224 --> 01:00:16,425
I don't know who that is.

1034
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,061
No, why?

1035
01:00:19,995 --> 01:00:21,697
I'm just looking for her.

1036
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:23,165
It's something personal.

1037
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:25,768
Sorry, to disturb you guys.

1038
01:00:25,801 --> 01:00:26,936
It's cool, man.

1039
01:00:26,969 --> 01:00:28,270
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1040
01:00:28,304 --> 01:00:29,639
I should be fine.

1041
01:00:29,673 --> 01:00:30,873
Okay.

1042
01:00:30,906 --> 01:00:32,208
- All right.
- Okay.

1043
01:00:32,241 --> 01:00:33,943
Okay, cool, nice
meeting you dude.

1044
01:00:33,976 --> 01:00:35,144
I'll see you guys.

1045
01:00:35,177 --> 01:00:36,245
- Yeah, definitely.
- Good night.

1046
01:00:47,691 --> 01:00:49,325
I know I'm intimidating.

1047
01:00:53,429 --> 01:00:54,797
Girls find me intimidating.

1048
01:00:55,998 --> 01:00:57,499
I always have to
make the first move.

1049
01:00:59,435 --> 01:01:02,672
Oh, well, I mean,
you're like really pretty

1050
01:01:02,706 --> 01:01:04,373
and really cool, so.

1051
01:01:04,406 --> 01:01:05,374
That makes sense.

1052
01:01:09,278 --> 01:01:10,913
But you're also like,

1053
01:01:10,946 --> 01:01:15,284
by far the sexiest bowler I've
ever seen working here, so.

1054
01:01:21,725 --> 01:01:23,292
This powder stuff
is really cool.

1055
01:01:24,694 --> 01:01:27,863
I took intro to drawing
class my freshman year.

1056
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:29,765
I was gonna be this
studio art minor.

1057
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:35,304
But we were suppose
to do a self-portrait

1058
01:01:35,337 --> 01:01:37,439
and I showed mine to the class

1059
01:01:37,473 --> 01:01:38,774
and everyone thought
it was a bottle

1060
01:01:38,807 --> 01:01:40,509
even though I was trying to...

1061
01:01:48,017 --> 01:01:50,019
And uh, I um.

1062
01:01:51,954 --> 01:01:54,323
I'm in an open relationship.

1063
01:01:56,959 --> 01:01:58,695
Uh oh, okay.

1064
01:01:58,728 --> 01:02:00,796
I was wondering about that.

1065
01:02:45,709 --> 01:02:47,409
Here, drink this.

1066
01:02:50,045 --> 01:02:50,946
Read this.

1067
01:02:52,782 --> 01:02:53,549
And this.

1068
01:02:55,284 --> 01:02:56,085
And this one.

1069
01:02:58,354 --> 01:03:00,356
You should probably
read all of these.

1070
01:03:00,389 --> 01:03:01,691
Just, I'll take you home.

1071
01:03:10,466 --> 01:03:11,200
Thanks.

1072
01:03:12,368 --> 01:03:13,502
What's your name?

1073
01:03:13,535 --> 01:03:15,471
Officer Mike's the name.

1074
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:16,538
Mike.

1075
01:03:16,572 --> 01:03:17,306
Yeah.

1076
01:03:19,308 --> 01:03:21,510
I'm sorry you had to
deal with me tonight.

1077
01:03:22,612 --> 01:03:24,581
Don't worry,
you're not to blame.

1078
01:03:24,614 --> 01:03:26,816
It's your parent's fault
for not raising you right.

1079
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:35,524
You always
come in here alone though.

1080
01:03:35,557 --> 01:03:38,227
Yeah, my friends hate bowling.

1081
01:03:39,395 --> 01:03:40,462
Yeah, I know.

1082
01:03:41,997 --> 01:03:44,701
They think it's like, just
for old people which it is,

1083
01:03:44,734 --> 01:03:45,501
kind of.

1084
01:03:45,534 --> 01:03:47,002
This place may close.

1085
01:03:47,035 --> 01:03:47,804
What?

1086
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:49,104
Yeah.

1087
01:03:49,138 --> 01:03:50,607
You guys should
like, I don't know.

1088
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:53,810
You should try and
make it like more cool

1089
01:03:53,843 --> 01:03:55,511
and like hipster and stuff.

1090
01:03:56,378 --> 01:03:57,946
Like, do like theme nights.

1091
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,915
Like you guys could do
like a Big Lebowskiy night

1092
01:03:59,948 --> 01:04:00,983
or something.

1093
01:04:01,016 --> 01:04:02,551
Yeah, you could guys could
do like White Russians

1094
01:04:02,585 --> 01:04:03,787
- and have like a bar.
- Huh.

1095
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:05,421
I don't know, that
might bring people in.

1096
01:04:05,454 --> 01:04:06,522
That's good.

1097
01:04:11,795 --> 01:04:15,431
Don't forget to wash your
feet before you go to sleep.

1098
01:04:15,464 --> 01:04:16,599
Otherwise, you'll get sick.

1099
01:04:19,268 --> 01:04:20,402
Thanks, again.

1100
01:04:23,138 --> 01:04:24,808
Yeah.

1101
01:05:12,622 --> 01:05:15,023
Shit.

1102
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:29,706
Anuka, please, please answer.

1103
01:05:29,739 --> 01:05:31,106
Please, please,
please, please, please.

1104
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:32,207
Hi, it's Anuka.

1105
01:05:32,241 --> 01:05:33,542
- No.
- Leave me a message.

1106
01:05:33,576 --> 01:05:36,078
And I'll call you back, thanks.

1107
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:50,058
Anuka.

1108
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:55,932
Anuka!

1109
01:05:59,002 --> 01:06:00,670
Anuka, you have my keys!

1110
01:06:01,638 --> 01:06:02,639
Anuka!

1111
01:06:07,309 --> 01:06:08,110
Anuka!

1112
01:06:12,447 --> 01:06:14,550
Izzy, shut up!

1113
01:06:14,584 --> 01:06:15,919
I've been calling
and texting you.

1114
01:06:15,952 --> 01:06:17,252
You have my keys.

1115
01:06:17,286 --> 01:06:18,988
Yeah, well
I've been sleeping.

1116
01:06:20,422 --> 01:06:22,324
Did you have a fun night?

1117
01:06:22,357 --> 01:06:23,258
Yeah.

1118
01:06:23,292 --> 01:06:24,526
Why are you being weird to me?

1119
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,862
I'm not being weird.

1120
01:06:25,895 --> 01:06:27,529
Yes you are, look at me.

1121
01:06:29,766 --> 01:06:30,499
What?

1122
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:38,473
Did you sleep with Julius?

1123
01:06:38,507 --> 01:06:39,976
What?

1124
01:06:40,009 --> 01:06:41,276
No.

1125
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:43,245
So you're trying to
tell me that you did not

1126
01:06:43,278 --> 01:06:44,513
go on a Tinder date with him?

1127
01:06:44,546 --> 01:06:47,282
Yeah, at the beginning
of the year, we.

1128
01:06:47,316 --> 01:06:48,550
Talked and got burritos.

1129
01:06:48,585 --> 01:06:50,019
Yeah, and why didn't
you tell me this?

1130
01:06:50,053 --> 01:06:51,988
'Cause I didn't think
it was a big deal.

1131
01:06:52,021 --> 01:06:56,158
My current boyfriend tried
sleeping with my best friend.

1132
01:06:56,191 --> 01:06:57,694
We didn't sleep together.

1133
01:06:57,727 --> 01:06:59,494
Oh and you
want me to believe that?

1134
01:06:59,528 --> 01:07:00,730
- Yes because...
- Because!

1135
01:07:00,763 --> 01:07:01,965
- Because...
- Because what!

1136
01:07:01,998 --> 01:07:03,900
Because I'm a virgin!

1137
01:07:07,804 --> 01:07:09,606
What about Travis?

1138
01:07:14,978 --> 01:07:18,280
So you've been lying
to me this whole year?

1139
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:23,285
Izzy, pick someone
and fuck them already.

1140
01:07:23,318 --> 01:07:25,520
It's not a big deal.

1141
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:31,894
There's so many guys that
are attracted to you.

1142
01:07:33,295 --> 01:07:36,231
You certainly don't
think that's true.

1143
01:07:47,175 --> 01:07:50,880
I was just trying to
boost your confidence.

1144
01:07:52,115 --> 01:07:54,516
How about you give
me my earrings back

1145
01:07:54,549 --> 01:07:56,853
and let's just call
it a night please.

1146
01:08:04,661 --> 01:08:06,294
Izzy, can I have
my earrings back?

1147
01:08:18,041 --> 01:08:19,742
I'm really sorry.

1148
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,180
I lost the other one.

1149
01:08:27,917 --> 01:08:28,718
You what?

1150
01:08:29,752 --> 01:08:31,688
At the party.

1151
01:08:31,721 --> 01:08:33,388
Are you serious?

1152
01:08:34,991 --> 01:08:35,792
I just...

1153
01:08:47,637 --> 01:08:48,905
Fuck!

1154
01:09:18,266 --> 01:09:22,004
Yo hey, I never thanked
you for saving the party,

1155
01:09:23,172 --> 01:09:24,272
earlier.

1156
01:09:24,306 --> 01:09:26,441
No, no, no, no problemo.

1157
01:09:28,745 --> 01:09:30,613
Nolan, who you talking to?

1158
01:09:32,815 --> 01:09:33,750
Okay, bye.

1159
01:09:34,951 --> 01:09:36,886
Hey, do you wanna
hang out for a bit?

1160
01:09:40,923 --> 01:09:42,592
So how come we've
never met before?

1161
01:09:43,893 --> 01:09:44,761
We did.

1162
01:09:45,928 --> 01:09:47,262
At orientation.

1163
01:09:47,295 --> 01:09:50,199
Oh, I was high
like that whole week.

1164
01:09:51,134 --> 01:09:53,301
You do music stuff?

1165
01:09:53,335 --> 01:09:56,471
I played bass for like
a month in middle school.

1166
01:09:58,141 --> 01:10:00,342
So that like doesn't
really count.

1167
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:01,911
I bet you have a
good voice, like,

1168
01:10:01,944 --> 01:10:04,379
high pitched, talk rat moaning.

1169
01:10:04,412 --> 01:10:06,281
Yeah, accurate.

1170
01:10:06,314 --> 01:10:07,482
So sexy.

1171
01:10:08,918 --> 01:10:10,119
Thanks.

1172
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:29,538
Do you wanna join?

1173
01:10:34,309 --> 01:10:36,212
And I'll trick behind you.

1174
01:10:39,314 --> 01:10:41,483
Yeah, yeah.

1175
01:11:18,855 --> 01:11:20,990
I have a final tomorrow.

1176
01:11:21,991 --> 01:11:22,925
This has been great.

1177
01:11:22,959 --> 01:11:24,526
Have a good summer.

1178
01:12:53,349 --> 01:12:56,085
Guys, I'm so sorry
I was such an idiot

1179
01:12:56,118 --> 01:12:57,987
and a horrible
friend last night.

1180
01:12:59,422 --> 01:13:02,058
Anuka, I won't leave campus
until I find the earring.

1181
01:13:02,091 --> 01:13:04,927
And Fiona, I'll obvi
apologize to Elise and Tony

1182
01:13:04,961 --> 01:13:06,796
about the shoes.

1183
01:13:06,829 --> 01:13:09,231
I'm gonna miss you ladies
so much this summer.

1184
01:13:09,265 --> 01:13:12,902
I wouldn't have survived
freshman year without you both.

1185
01:13:12,935 --> 01:13:16,038
Heart emoji, praise hands
emoji, family emoji.

1186
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:20,977
You still alive
after last night?

1187
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:22,812
Trying.

1188
01:13:22,845 --> 01:13:24,280
You?

1189
01:13:24,313 --> 01:13:25,848
Yeah, you know, I've been
here since six, chugging coffee.

1190
01:13:25,881 --> 01:13:26,682
Bam!

1191
01:13:27,984 --> 01:13:30,485
Um, how was the
rest of your night?

1192
01:13:30,518 --> 01:13:33,089
You know, just uh.

1193
01:13:35,324 --> 01:13:38,961
Typical, typical
party stuff, whew!

1194
01:13:38,995 --> 01:13:40,997
I have a final that
I have to, go to.

1195
01:13:42,164 --> 01:13:42,965
Cheers.

1196
01:13:44,133 --> 01:13:45,167
Cheers to you.

1197
01:13:56,379 --> 01:13:58,948
You make things hard
for yourself, don't you?

1198
01:14:04,987 --> 01:14:05,788
Thanks.

1199
01:14:07,156 --> 01:14:09,625
- You have an exam now.
- Yeah, Astro 101.

1200
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:13,295
Cool well, see ya.

1201
01:14:13,329 --> 01:14:14,096
Good luck.

1202
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,075
- Shoes?
- Found the shoes.

1203
01:14:26,108 --> 01:14:27,176
- Good.
- Tony.

1204
01:14:27,209 --> 01:14:28,177
What?

1205
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:30,046
I have a solution.

1206
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:30,980
- Hit me.
- Okay.

1207
01:14:32,882 --> 01:14:33,883
Theme nights.

1208
01:14:35,484 --> 01:14:36,786
Bedazzle Raffle.

1209
01:14:36,819 --> 01:14:38,487
Disco night.

1210
01:14:38,521 --> 01:14:39,422
Ladies night.

1211
01:14:39,455 --> 01:14:41,023
I just really think that,

1212
01:14:42,491 --> 01:14:44,427
we just need to get
people in here, you know.

1213
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,762
I think the themes
will bring people in,

1214
01:14:46,796 --> 01:14:48,964
people love that,
they can Instagram it.

1215
01:14:48,998 --> 01:14:51,801
- I just...
- Hmm hmm, hmm hmm.

1216
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:56,138
This one could work.

1217
01:14:56,172 --> 01:14:57,239
- Bedazzle Raffle.
- Hmm hmm.

1218
01:14:57,273 --> 01:14:58,874
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1219
01:14:58,908 --> 01:15:00,142
- Diamonds.
- I like the diamonds.

1220
01:15:00,176 --> 01:15:01,977
Hmm hmm.

1221
01:15:02,011 --> 01:15:02,912
My grandma liked diamonds.

1222
01:15:02,945 --> 01:15:04,213
You know I like my grandma.

1223
01:15:04,246 --> 01:15:05,347
- Neon...
- Neon.

1224
01:15:05,381 --> 01:15:06,916
- But no, for sure.
- Hmm hmm.

1225
01:15:06,949 --> 01:15:07,817
- Hmm hmm.
- For sure.

1226
01:15:07,850 --> 01:15:08,617
Hmm hmm.

1227
01:15:09,685 --> 01:15:10,586
- Okay.
- Okay.

1228
01:15:10,619 --> 01:15:11,253
- Cool.
- Thank you.

1229
01:15:11,287 --> 01:15:12,088
Yeah.

1230
01:15:13,189 --> 01:15:14,056
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

1231
01:15:14,090 --> 01:15:15,491
Okay.

1232
01:15:23,299 --> 01:15:26,102
Thanks, let me know
about the earring.

1233
01:15:26,135 --> 01:15:27,736
I'll post about it on Facebook.

1234
01:15:29,138 --> 01:15:30,139
I'm gonna miss you both.

1235
01:15:30,172 --> 01:15:32,341
Let's make sure we FaceTime.

1236
01:15:32,374 --> 01:15:33,976
Kissing face emoji.

1237
01:15:34,009 --> 01:15:37,146
It's fine Izzy, actually.

1238
01:15:37,179 --> 01:15:38,747
Elise and I stayed up all night

1239
01:15:38,781 --> 01:15:41,217
'cause she had a really great
idea for saving the lanes.

1240
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:42,751
It was hot.

1241
01:15:42,785 --> 01:15:45,054
Fire emoji.

1242
01:15:45,087 --> 01:15:47,990
I can't believe you threw
up on her white shoes, LOL.

1243
01:15:48,924 --> 01:15:51,026
Crush that astro exam, okay?

1244
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:52,561
Love you, winky face.

1245
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:07,977
Good morning, good morning.

1246
01:16:08,844 --> 01:16:11,147
Now, we will all.

1247
01:16:18,254 --> 01:16:19,855
Now we will all stand.

1248
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:22,958
Yes, yes, everyone
up on your feet.

1249
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:26,962
As I like to do
before every exam.

1250
01:16:26,996 --> 01:16:30,900
And reach your arms
up the heavens.

1251
01:16:30,933 --> 01:16:34,103
Up to the celestial sphere
and ask for some support

1252
01:16:34,136 --> 01:16:36,238
from the sky on this exam.

1253
01:16:37,573 --> 01:16:39,074
You may be seated.

1254
01:16:42,077 --> 01:16:43,580
Izzy.

1255
01:16:43,613 --> 01:16:45,681
