1
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,800
Ok.

2
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,300
My name is Sandrine.
I'm the new one.

3
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
As you see, I'm behind the bar.

4
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,100
Sometimes I'm the cloakroom attendant.
I don't like it.

5
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
But I have to make a living.

6
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,400
So I just watch the show,
the girls.

7
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,300
I'm only really interested in Nathalie.

8
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,100
She's my secret role model.

9
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,900
She's beautiful.

10
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,300
She can win anybody over.

11
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,900
Actually,

12
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,000
although I don't like to admit it,
I wish I had that ability too.

13
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,900
To make them all drool
and have them at my feet.

14
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,500
If you don't want to fuck him,
you don't.

15
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,800
Girls, I have a club here that does well.

16
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,500
Why?

17
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,700
Because the customer knows
he gets what he wants.

18
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,500
That's what I pay you for.
You, Nathalie, I like you.

19
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,200
You have a cute ass
that attracts many customers.

20
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,800
But you know that I'm...

21
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,800
not affected.

22
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,200
You, Sandrine, you're free.

23
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,300
Nobody tells you what to do.

24
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,800
Except...

25
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,900
the world is the way it is.

26
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,000
It's your choice.

27
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,700
Don't give in to that pig.

28
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,000
Asshole.

29
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,200
Aren't you going home?

30
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,800
I'm three months behind on the rent.
My landlady would kick me out.

31
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,800
And the boss knows that, right?

32
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,600
Damnit.

33
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,300
Come to me then.

34
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,700
This created a true bond
between us.

35
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,800
Do you want to eat?
- No, thanks.

36
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
Champagne?

37
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,100
Where do you live?
- In a little attic room in Montmartre.

38
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,500
At first, I was so happy.

39
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,300
It was expensive and small,
but it was all mine.

40
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,300
But after all these evenings on my own...
- Do you live alone?

41
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,800
Didn't you have a boyfriend?
- We broke up straight after.

42
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,300
He was more of a buddy.
Although we did sleep together.

43
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,700
But I hadn't left
my parents

44
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,400
to become a prisoner again.

45
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,400
How was he?
- What do you mean?

46
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,000
In bed.

47
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,700
It was good occasionally.
Just once.

48
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,900
In the car.

49
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,700
He was driving.
My left hand was on my knee.

50
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,300
He let go of the wheel.

51
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,300
took my hand and slowly pushed
it up along my thigh.

52
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,900
And then, still as slowly...

53
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,500
he forced me to caress myself.
That time I felt something.

54
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,600
But the next day
we still broke up.

55
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,500
And you?

56
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,300
Nothing special. I studied ballet.
Graduated.

57
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,600
And ended up in that club.

58
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,700
Can I ask you something?
- Shoot.

59
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,800
It's an indiscrete question.
- Go ahead.

60
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,100
Since I work in that joint, I've...

61
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,100
What does it do to you to dance
naked in front of all those people watching?

62
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,500
Nothing.

63
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,100
You turn them on, don't you?
- Most of the time it's routine.

64
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,900
Most of the time?

65
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,700
Once, I came intensely
on the stage.

66
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,900
More intense than with a man?

67
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,300
That night I had the most
intense orgasm ever.

68
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,300
Why?
- Because everybody was watching me.

69
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,900
Because men were watching you?
- Because everybody was watching me.

70
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,800
It turned me on very much
and I came.

71
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,100
It's happened more often.

72
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,500
So that's it.

73
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,300
What?
- What makes you so seductive.

74
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,100
Did it happen tonight too?
- You can't win them all.

75
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,400
Does it embarrass you what I just said?
- No. I envy you.

76
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,100
I would never have dared.

77
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,700
Dare what?
Show your nudity?

78
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,500
Enjoy turning them on?
Or coming?

79
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
All those things.

80
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,800
But I'm not pretty enough.
- That's what us girls all say.

81
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,400
I was afraid that evening too.

82
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,700
The evening you...
- Yes.

83
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,300
I had had some champagne.

84
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,600
Like tonight.

85
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,100
Just enough to feel light...

86
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,300
nice... without being drunk.

87
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,700
And I had the guts.

88
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,700
And I came intensely.

89
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,000
Am I shocking you?
- No.

90
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,100
Like I said, I envy you.

91
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,500
What stops you from doing it too?
- I'd never dare.

92
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,400
Are you drunk?

93
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
No.

94
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,400
No, I feel ok.

95
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,700
Let's play a game then.

96
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,500
What kind of game?
- A dare game.

97
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,400
Dare cross that border
in your head

98
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,100
that none of your female friends
will ever cross.

99
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,800
And it will give you pleasure.

100
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,100
I would have preferred to leave.

101
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,100
No.
- Stay, I'm not going to jump you.

102
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,700
It has to happen in your
head first.

103
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,200
Ok.

104
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,900
Now close your eyes.

105
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,900
Let yourself get carried away.

106
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,300
The rest will follow automatically.

107
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,400
Go to the bed.

108
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,500
At the same time, I was thinking:

109
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,300
What's the risk?
You can leave whenever you want.

110
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,800
Well, will you have
the guts?

111
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,800
Get under the sheet.

112
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,100
Undress under the sheet.

113
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,500
Close your eyes.

114
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,600
Let yourself go.

115
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,200
Each time you hesitate.

116
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,400
it takes only a little effort
to go further

117
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,200
and to dare enjoy it.

118
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,100
Softly caress your body.

119
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Try to discover it.

120
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,300
Without any shame.

121
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,800
Softly stroke your skin.

122
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,100
Find the spots
that give you enjoyment.

123
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,100
Softly stroke with your hand over your thigh...

124
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,000
over the inside of your thigh.

125
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,300
Is it good?

126
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,600
Take of your bra.

127
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,100
And your panties.

128
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,800
Start caressing yourself again.

129
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,800
Is it good?

130
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,500
Keep going.

131
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,900
Now remove the sheet.

132
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,500
You're beautiful.

133
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,600
Give in to the enjoyment
of being naked and being watched.

134
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,500
Is it good?

135
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,700
Keep going to the extreme.

136
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,800
Now.

137
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,800
Goodnight.

138
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,900
Where did you sleep?
- I have another room.

139
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,300
How do you feel?

140
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,900
Very good.
I'm here. You're here.

141
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,900
But then there's my landlady.

142
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,000
We'll have to negotiate.

143
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,300
I have to find a new job.
- Do you want to live here?

144
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,800
I can lend you some money
until you're on your feet.

145
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,900
Then you return it.
- That would be great.

146
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,800
It would be fun even.

147
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,500
But I'd be in your way.
You must have friends.

148
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,400
They never visit me at home.

149
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,800
Do you like women.
I'm not a lesbian.

150
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,200
Me neither.

151
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
No, it's just...

152
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,100
I'm fed up with being alone
but I don't want a man.

153
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,700
And somehow...

154
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
I like you.

155
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,000
Come, move in with me
and we'll find you a job.

156
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,300
Hello, mum.

157
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,100
Hi... And?

158
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Did you move?
Tell me. Here, here.

159
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,100
Don't leave crumbs everywhere.
What's that friend of yours like?

160
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,200
She's nice.
We each have our own room.

161
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,700
And she doesn't ask questions.
I don't have to justify everything I do to her.

162
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,100
Have you got a job? You're not
waitress again at a restaurant?

163
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,500
If you could call it a restaurant.

164
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,700
I'm going to do office work.
Bookkeeper or secretary.

165
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,800
Look me in the eye.

166
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,000
Are you lying?
- No, really.

167
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,300
Come, give me a kiss.

168
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,600
And say hello to your father.
- Where is he?

169
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,700
There, in the garden.

170
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,100
Each morning, he's pacing around,

171
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,500
waiting for a phone call
about a new job.

172
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,300
Poor dad. He could go to the movies
or the theatre with you.

173
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,200
Or just go for a walk together.

174
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,800
I responded to so many ads,
back then.

175
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,900
And talked to so many personnel managers.
But only in small companies.

176
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,200
In the big ones, you don't get past
the subordinates.

177
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,600
In hindsight, Nathalie left me hanging
like that on purpose.

178
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,600
One day we were in the subway.
And we were both fed up.

179
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,700
I think we handled
it wrong.

180
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,600
We were just doing what
everybody did.

181
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,900
Without money or relations,
we're eternal losers.

182
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,300
From now on, we're using

183
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,700
our guts and our bodies to get ahead.
- We won't be the only ones.

184
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,500
Shyness can't slow us down.

185
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,600
We're going further and we'll do more
than all the other girls.

186
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,700
Come on.
Let's show some guts right away.

187
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,600
How?
- You understood.

188
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,100
Discretely take off your bra.
- Here?

189
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,700
Yes.
- Are you mad?

190
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,100
Do it.

191
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,900
In front of everybody?
- Nobody will notice.

192
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Look.

193
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,000
Now you.

194
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,300
Pretend it's perfectly normal.

195
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,300
Put your handbag in your lap
to cover yourself.

196
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,300
Caress yourself.

197
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,400
One guy saw me.

198
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,500
There, on the left.

199
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,300
Keep going.

200
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,000
How does it make you feel?

201
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,500
I'm kind of scared.

202
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,300
It's exciting to be watched.

203
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,700
Show yourself now.

204
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,500
Quickly.

205
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,100
Come!

206
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,100
To stop there
would have been too easy.

207
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,000
But she knew the subway stations
were full of cameras.

208
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,900
Do it now.

209
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,700
I thought you didn't fancy women?
- I want to make you come.

210
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,200
We've been caught.
- Doesn't matter. Go on.

211
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,300
Quick, hurry.

212
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,100
Strange to walk around
naked under our coats

213
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,800
amongst the clueless crowds.

214
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,800
Strange, but very good.

215
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,400
And this is how we continued.

216
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,200
I had developed guts

217
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,700
and that gave me a feeling of superiority
over everybody I met.

218
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,900
Next chapter.
Men, the manual.

219
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,800
First you have to choose a good one.
But don't jump his bones.

220
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,600
Play the innocent girl who still has to
learn everything and who picked him as her protector.

221
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,700
We can all do that. Men want sex
and then the next woman.

222
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,200
That's why you shouldn't fuck them.
Or at least, not necessarily.

223
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,500
You study him and let him talk.

224
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,000
Look for his weak spot and find out what drives him.
Money, cars...

225
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,500
I don't know, dough, work.
Once you know, you flatter him.

226
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,400
Once you've picked the right one,
you succumb.

227
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,500
But not right away. He shouldn't think
you're easy.

228
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,500
But not too slowly either.
He'd get bored.

229
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,100
After three or four dinners
you pull out the big guns.

230
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,400
You give him pleasure and make him think
only he can make you come.

231
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,300
You play the obedient, happy girl.
But not for too long.

232
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,300
In bed, you soon stop the comedy.

233
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,900
He gets peeved off right away
when you don't come anymore.

234
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,300
You drop him and you
cheat on him.

235
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,500
Openly.

236
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,800
With meaningless flings.
Also with a woman, if possible.

237
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,800
That humiliates him. He'll go crazy
and come to you on his knees.

238
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,500
And that always works?
- Almost always.

239
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,000
That's the mystery of human nature.

240
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,400
You get attached to what resists
to you or escapes you.

241
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,900
Who taught you that?

242
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,700
Life.
My mother.

243
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,500
But we were a poor family.

244
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,500
I read a lot too.
I studied, just like you.

245
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,900
And we still ended up
in the same nightclub.

246
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,200
Women lack
self confidence and guts.

247
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,900
We always need somebody to
encourage us.

248
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,100
In a way, we're like proletarians.

249
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,300
My mother said
she'd always stay one

250
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,900
because she was afraid to improve herself.
"Have guts," she always told me.

251
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,800
Human nature
had no secrets for her.

252
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,300
I never came with a man.
- I know.

253
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,000
And that's fine.
- Yes... Well, as a manner of speech.

254
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,100
Yes, really. You'll soon understand.
What did you do with your boyfriend?

255
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,000
I faked it.
- Why?

256
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,300
Because I wanted to please him.

257
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,400
No. You felt guilty because
you thought it was you.

258
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,900
Wrong.
Third lesson: A femme fatale

259
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,900
tends to be narcissistic or lesbian
and frigid with men.

260
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,900
They only come when they feel like it,
which is not often. That's their power.

261
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,300
With the famous courtesans...
- You want to turn me into a classy whore.

262
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,300
No, I'm explaining life to you.

263
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,300
As I said,
with the famous courtesans

264
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,500
every man hopes to succeed
where all the others failed.

265
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,900
Out of pride, they're prepared
to pay fortunes

266
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,100
to smugly parade next to them.

267
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,100
A bit of frigidity with men performs miracles.
You quickly become addicted to the weapon of sex.

268
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,000
And you should leave being
a slave to others.

269
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,300
You can now come on your own.
You're free. Understand?

270
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,800
And what about love?
- That's our biggest enemy.

271
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,900
The real risk of the trade. During war,
if you start to think, you're dead.

272
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,000
When you fall in love, you're fucked.

273
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,400
Was your life a dream so far?

274
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,600
You have no choice if you want to escape.
Nobody will help you.

275
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,800
That big love
can come later.

276
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,400
Now show me how you faked it.

277
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,300
Did you do that with your boyfriend?

278
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,200
What did you do on stage?
- I faked my real orgasms.

279
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,200
Ok, one more time.

280
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,300
And, did I come or not?

281
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,200
Why, was that fake?
- Yes.

282
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,600
Well, sort of.
- That's good.

283
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,200
It's really difficult to fake it
when you don't feel like it at all.

284
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,900
There are only offices here.

285
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,300
You don't want me to work there, do you?
- Yes, I do.

286
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,700
Is that why I'm wearing
these bourgeois clothes?

287
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,500
No, I won't do it.
I can't.

288
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,700
It reminds me of my father.

289
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:42,000
We're beautiful. We can try our luck in fashion
or showbiz. Or the movies.

290
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,300
In those scenes, girls are picked up
and thrown down again by the dozens.

291
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,400
Remember our nightclub.

292
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
There's less competition in offices.

293
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,900
And you mentioned your father.

294
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,500
I bet work was his life.

295
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,000
And he worked for ungrateful people too.

296
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,600
But he must have had fantasies.

297
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,100
Forget he's your father.
See him like anybody else.

298
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,500
Do you think he had fantasies?
- Like anybody.

299
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,900
And did he pursue them with your mother?

300
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,100
Believe me, he didn't pursue them
with anybody.

301
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,300
Dirty magazines, porn movies,
maybe a whore.

302
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,200
But always in secret and in shame.
Am I wrong?

303
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,600
A nerdy loser who never lived
would be an easy prey, yes.

304
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,300
Now think of men like him

305
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,400
but much higher on the social ladder.

306
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,200
They'll be our victims.

307
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,600
Good morning, ladies.

308
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,100
Are you here for the ad?

309
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,800
Sit down. You'll be called.

310
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,500
This is when Nathalie really surprised me.
That man was the personnel manager.

311
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,700
I didn't think he had looked at anybody
during those few seconds.

312
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:20,200
I don't know how she did it,
by crossing her legs or opening them...

313
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,600
she didn't exactly
flash her breasts...

314
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,100
Nor her legs.

315
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,300
The look in her eyes, maybe?
- Miss?

316
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,700
Me?
- Come please.

317
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,300
You too, miss.

318
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,500
We were both hired.
I was hired at Statistics,

319
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,200
a department where everybody did calculations.
Well, I wasn't that good with numbers.

320
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,600
So, I was only a secretary
and a hostess. A maid, so to speak.

321
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,700
But Nathalie

322
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,100
became personal assistant
of the Human Resources Manager

323
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,300
as that's called these days.

324
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,200
And in the main office too.
She worked at the Champs Elysées.

325
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,600
I envied her a bit.

326
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,500
You work here at central office SM.

327
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,600
That stands for Stock Management.
We're the brain of the company.

328
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,400
Everybody here is your colleague. They're
each responsible for a range of products.

329
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,500
And there behind his desk

330
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,100
is Mr. Cadène, your superior.

331
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,900
With him is Mr. Delacroix.

332
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,600
In the Barnay Group,
two men are important: Mr. Delacroix

333
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,700
and Barnay senior, but he's 65.

334
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,100
He's very ill.
We rarely see him anymore.

335
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,100
Mr. Delacroix is really in charge.

336
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,900
He's very friendly, you'll see.
Sometimes a bit absent minded.

337
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
But authority isn't always easy.

338
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,400
And he?

339
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,100
That's Barnay Jr.,
our General Director.

340
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,700
His first name's Christophe.
We don't see him in the office often.

341
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,300
But for less serious reasons
than his father.

342
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,300
A man with charm,

343
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,300
but dangerous.

344
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,900
Sir... I'd like to introduce
the new girl.

345
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,000
Good morning, miss.
No, stay seated.

346
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,700
I hope you'll like it here.

347
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,200
This is the most important
department of the company.

348
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,700
And the most interesting one.

349
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,400
If you work well,
you can expect a lot.

350
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,300
You'll be one of the rare women
between 35 men.

351
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,200
Don't let them pamper you too much.

352
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,100
Good luck, miss.

353
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,500
See you later.

354
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,600
If you can stay a bit longer this evening...

355
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,900
Don't worry,
just to get to know each other.

356
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,200
Excuse me.

357
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,400
And? Do you like it here?

358
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,100
What do you find the most interesting?
- It's too early to say.

359
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,700
Actually, I'd like to do
as much as possible.

360
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,700
Get to know everything about the company.

361
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,100
You see, I recently experienced
a big disappointment.

362
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,600
In matters of love?

363
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,300
I'm not over it yet
and I'd like to forget it.

364
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,900
By burying myself in work.

365
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,000
I don't want to go home early

366
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,300
and I'd like to work overtime.

367
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,100
Work.

368
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,300
Even after everybody has gone home

369
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,900
and the offices are deserted.
- But...

370
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,400
Do you live on your own?

371
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,100
Sorry, I'm indiscrete.

372
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,900
No, with a friend.

373
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,100
I'll try to take care of it.
The overtime, I mean.

374
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,200
Do you know about IT?
- Only from school.

375
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,300
I only did high school.

376
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,700
The company computer is being
upgraded completely.

377
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,200
All data have to be
entered again.

378
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,800
I can get you involved with that.

379
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,400
Fine. Thank you.

380
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,100
Sorry, I didn't know it was this late.
- No problem.

381
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,700
On the contrary.

382
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,500
See you tomorrow.
- You're not going home through that rain, I hope?

383
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,800
Will you wait with me in the pub?

384
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,600
No, thank you.
- Then I'll take you to the subway.

385
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,700
No, that's ok.
Thank you.

386
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,700
Beautiful, a broken heart.

387
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,400
What was the name of the guy?
- Cadène.

388
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,300
Robert Cadène?
- Yes.

389
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,700
I have information about everybody.

390
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,600
Telephone, health, address.

391
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,100
Even confidential stuff.
- Secrets?

392
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,300
Cadène, 35. Studied commerce.
Lives in the 20th arrondissement.

393
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,600
Apolitical. Comment:

394
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,900
Sound, professionally efficient.

395
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,500
Got preferential treatment from the company, so they
could get a grip on him. Looks for an attractive woman

396
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,000
to receive guests in the weekend.

397
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:30,500
No. The only really important man
is Barnay Jr.

398
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,700
When the old man dies, he becomes
the boss of the company

399
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,600
and of all of his father's empire.

400
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:43,300
Unfortunately, I know nothing about him,
except the company gossip.

401
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,300
Or wait, he has a sister.
- Why isn't he married?

402
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:49,600
Loves women too much.
- Quite a challenge for us.

403
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,900
What do you mean?

404
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,400
He's dangerous and wild.

405
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Almost impossible to tame.

406
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,100
We have to be careful with him.

407
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,900
But under him, there's Delacroix.
49, married for 22 years.

408
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,700
Two children, 16 and 18.

409
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,900
Plays tennis every Tuesday night.

410
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,600
Lives for his work and family.
More for his work, actually.

411
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,500
Beautiful apartment in Neuilly.

412
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,300
Never had an affair.

413
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,800
The ideal target.

414
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,300
For now, keep sucking up to Cadène.
He can prove useful later on.

415
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,900
But Delacroix will be
our first target.

416
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,700
Every Saturday he has lunch
with his mother, after leaving the office.

417
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,800
Hello, how's it going?

418
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,500
Shall I bring a coffee?
- No, thank you.

419
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,800
A glass of water?
- No, thanks.

420
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,400
A juice then?
- No, that's ok.

421
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,400
Shall we have a drink together, tonight?

422
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,100
No, thank you.

423
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,300
See you later then.
- See you later.

424
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,200
Do you have the Port Cergy model?
I can't find it.

425
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,000
Everything has been blocked until tomorrow.
- Damn.

426
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,200
All we can do, is
wait until tomorrow.

427
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,900
Miss, please pass me the
invoices of Mrs. Castaldi,

428
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,900
Mr. Guédiguian,

429
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,900
of Sacif and Societep.
Thank you.

430
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,500
You should promote her.

431
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,100
Who?
- That new girl. Sandrine.

432
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,700
She's serious and works hard.

433
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,100
And she's always friendly.

434
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,300
And the high number?
- Here.

435
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,800
My bag!

436
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,600
Mommy!

437
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,800
What is it? Did you hurt yourself?
Did you fall?

438
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,900
It's nothing.

439
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,500
It's nothing. Better thank the lady.
- Thank you... But...

440
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,200
You're the girl from the office.
- And you're Mr. Delacroix.

441
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,200
What a coincidence.

442
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,300
Thank you.

443
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,100
What happened?

444
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,300
A boy wanted to take your mother's
bag. I was able to prevent it.

445
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,400
Do you live near here?
- Not at all. Quite a coincidence.

446
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,100
Well, goodbye then.

447
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,400
Don't let her go like that.
- Don't get upset.

448
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,100
Miss!

449
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,100
What can I do to thank you?
- Nothing.

450
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,400
Thank you.

451
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,500
Ok... And now... here.

452
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,700
No, you start here.

453
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,300
Is Sandrine there?
- Yes.

454
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,600
Yes?
- Mr. Delacroix wants a word with you.

455
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Right now?
- Yes, right now.

456
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,800
Mr. Delacroix.

457
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,600
Sandrine...

458
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,400
Hello, miss.

459
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,700
Sit down.

460
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,700
Ok.

461
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,700
Miss...

462
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,700
my secretary's swamped in work.

463
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,800
We're creating a new job
to help her. I was thinking of you.

464
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,800
You'll get paid more and, in the long run,
the work will be more interesting.

465
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,000
You have no reply to that?

466
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,500
Can I ask you an honest question?
- Yes, of course.

467
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,100
Are you suggesting this because of the
incident with your mother?

468
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,200
Yes. I mean... no.

469
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,100
I don't want a reward for
doing that. Really.

470
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,900
I'd like a better job the day
you think I'm suitable for it

471
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,400
because of my work.

472
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,900
Everybody here is very content with you.

473
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,800
You don't blame me, do you?
- No.

474
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,300
Can I go now?
- But of course.

475
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,500
Maybe I exaggerated a bit.

476
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,300
Don't eat that one.
Take this one. Look.

477
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
There's nothing in it.
- That's why.

478
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,300
Oh, you eat that?
- Just chew.

479
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,900
There you are.

480
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,600
I feel good with you.

481
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,700
Me too.

482
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,700
Really very good.

483
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,100
Are you angry?

484
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,600
I'm sorry.

485
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,800
Is your last experience still bothering you?

486
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,600
I had completely forgotten
about my broken heart.

487
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,600
You should tell me about it.
- Tell you what?

488
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,400
It's good to talk about it.

489
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,900
It's a relief.
- I can't really forget it yet.

490
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,300
It only started to get better after 2 years.

491
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:48,100
I was lucky to have my job,
the office, the nice people.

492
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,800
That's why I refused the promotion.

493
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,400
I'm falling in love with you.

494
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,700
It's too early.

495
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,700
Maybe later.

496
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:11,300
At least accept it, please.
Accept your promotion.

497
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,100
I'll ask them to forget
about your refusal.

498
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,300
Do you promise to accept?

499
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,700
Ok.

500
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:25,500
Thanks.
- For what?

501
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,800
The movie, the restaurant.

502
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,200
Everything.

503
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,200
I envy the man you'll marry.

504
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,100
Who was that?
- You scared me.

505
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,900
Who was it?
- Who do you mean?

506
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,900
Cut it out.
Was it your department manager?

507
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,800
Or the man of your heart?

508
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,100
You're mean.

509
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,600
You never say anything,
just like the men.

510
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,700
I tell you everything, you know everything
about me, but I know nothing about you.

511
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,100
Come on, I'm not a jealous guy.

512
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,500
I'm superstitious.
- So not your department manager.

513
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,700
The man of your heart.

514
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,100
You don't confide in anybody.

515
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,700
I'm hiding him, because it's serious.
I want to be sure he's for me.

516
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,900
Oh dear, a schoolgirl.

517
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,600
But she did have guts.

518
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,700
She's really hiding him
because she was afraid of me.

519
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,600
But I would never have
stolen her guy from her.

520
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,700
Besides, she was taking me for a ride.

521
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,500
Her big lesson about love
as the big enemy

522
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,600
applied to others,
but not to herself.

523
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,700
Miss Sandrine Tessier?
- Yes.

524
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,700
I'm the secretary of Mr. Barnay Jr.
You're expected by the Board.

525
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,100
Right now?
- Yes.

526
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,800
I'll be right there.

527
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,600
Nathalie?
I've hit the jackpot.

528
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,400
You didn't sleep with Barnay Jr., did you?
- No, they want to see me.

529
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,900
Keep your head cool.
Don't blow it.

530
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:22,600
He tries to get girls
so he can hurt them later.

531
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,900
Come in.

532
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,000
Damn, he's handsome.

533
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:57,000
For a moment I even forgot why I was there.
I came closer,

534
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:01,300
not because I had to,
but to see him from up close.

535
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,500
And he turned out even more handsome.
- Sit down.

536
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,600
Let me see the white raven.

537
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,700
White raven?
- You, miss.

538
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,400
What do you mean?

539
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,400
I'm going to give you an order.

540
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,900
To become the second secretary
of Mr. Delacroix.

541
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,600
Soon private secretary.

542
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,500
Don't speak. I'm ordering you.

543
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,400
And you can't leave the Barnay company.
- Why would I do that?

544
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,500
In case you thought you didn't earn

545
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:44,600
the job I'm ordering you to accept,
by your own work.

546
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,300
Miss Tessier, the company can't do
without a precious element like you.

547
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,300
A young woman

548
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,100
who gives her heart and soul
to work and overtime.

549
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,300
Denies herself a personal life,

550
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,700
hired for her arithmetic skills.

551
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,300
Although you're mainly a secretary.

552
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,800
You see, miss, these days...

553
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,900
someone with your merit

554
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,600
and morals

555
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,800
is a beautiful and rare find.

556
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,900
One wonders why, by the way.

557
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,500
We see the proof every day:
merit...

558
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,800
that's the only thing that counts.

559
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,600
I'm the living proof.

560
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,900
I congratulate you on your promotion.
See you soon, miss.

561
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,100
Your character intrigues me.

562
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,700
My character?
- Your personality, I mean.

563
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,900
Everybody really appreciates you.

564
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,700
Mr. Delacroix is a remarkable man.

565
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,400
And well positioned.
- What do you mean?

566
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:50,500
That you're very interesting to...

567
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,900
the company and myself.
You can go now.

568
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,500
Hello.
- Hello, Sandrine.

569
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,600
You look a bit pale.

570
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,900
You haven't refused again, have you?

571
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,100
Mrs. Mercier, please get a
bottle of champagne.

572
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,100
I announce to you the promotion
of Sandrine.

573
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,300
She'll be my second secretary.

574
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:26,400
You've served me with dedication for 15 years.
You deserve some help.

575
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,200
But I can handle fine.
- Really, you'll be a lot happier.

576
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,400
Sit down.

577
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:46,300
One month later, Nathalie had secured
her pre-pension.

578
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,000
Are you listening?

579
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,400
Hello. Everything ok?

580
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,100
I've got 2 tickets for Madonna tomorrow.

581
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,900
That's not possible.
We're working until 10 o'clock at least.

582
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,200
You do have time for a drink, don't you?
- Too much work.

583
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,600
Honestly, are you avoiding me?

584
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,900
You haven't wanted to see me for weeks.
- I'm seeing you now.

585
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,400
You know what I mean.
- I'm really busy.

586
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:01,000
You know, soon we'll all be
completely lonely because

587
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,900
of those machines, those computers.

588
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,200
Sandrine?

589
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,900
Good evening, sir.

590
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,800
There's nobody left.
Will you turn off the lights?

591
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,900
As always.
- Thank you, goodbye.

592
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,200
Stop it.

593
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,200
Yes.

594
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,900
One moment, please.

595
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,500
The Japanese.

596
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:44,500
Hello? Delacroix speaking.

597
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,900
Yes, how are you?

598
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,600
Fine, fine.

599
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,700
Yes, the contracts will be ready.

600
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,800
Within two months.

601
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,200
Stop it.

602
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,600
Don't do that.

603
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,200
We're expecting you in Paris.

604
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,100
for the contracts.

605
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,800
We're ready for the meeting.

606
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,900
I'm coming.
Close the door.

607
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I don't know

608
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,500
what's happening with the line.

609
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,400
I can't hear you.

610
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,200
Can you hear me?

611
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,600
I can't hear you.

612
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,400
I'll call you back.

613
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,700
Ok, I'll call you back.

614
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,600
Everything ok?
- Yes, sure.

615
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:06,500
Where are you going?

616
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,800
See you later then.
- Ok.

617
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,900
Hi.
How is it going here?

618
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,300
Fine.

619
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,800
There's something wrong with your tie.

620
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,200
See you later.

621
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,800
Hello, Sandrine.

622
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,900
Everything ok?
- And you?

623
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:51,000
How are things with Delacroix?
- Fine.

624
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,700
Will we see each other tonight?

625
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,800
Yes, see you tonight.
- See you then.

626
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,300
Miss...

627
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,300
I need you right away.

628
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,200
A shame I could never
afford that.

629
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,600
Do you want to see my stockings?

630
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,600
Stop it.

631
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,600
You're crazy.

632
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,300
Taxi!

633
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,600
2 months ago I couldn't have known
you'd make me discover life...

634
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,100
at the age of 50.

635
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,300
Every second without you hurts.

636
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:49,400
Please don't get attached to me.
- It's too late.

637
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,700
It can't last between us...

638
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:56,600
but I can't think of that
or I start to panic.

639
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,800
The direct line.
Must be your wife.

640
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:06,200
Hello?

641
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,200
Oh, it's you.

642
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:13,800
I must have given the loser
a short moment of happiness.

643
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,800
He told me all these

644
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,300
sweet little things that showed
he's in love.

645
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:24,300
I never experienced it myself.
I started to envy him for it.

646
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,600
I pretended I loved him,
as if I came with him.

647
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:33,200
Everything. And in the end
I had nothing at all.

648
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,300
Except Nathalie, but she was
no knight in shining armour.

649
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,300
That's why I wanted Christophe.

650
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:45,200
Do you know the Barnay family well?
- Especially the father.

651
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,500
He's a self-made man,
old school.

652
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,900
With a strong sense of honour

653
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:58,300
and responsibility.
A dinosaur.

654
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:03,100
We founded the company together
and overcame a lot of problems.

655
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,800
That created a bond of mutual trust.

656
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,900
I've often been invited to his chateau.
- Chateau?

657
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,800
Can't you take me one day?

658
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,200
You know that's impossible.

659
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,800
And Christophe?

660
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:23,400
He got the most beautiful women
of the company.

661
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:24,700
Tell me...

662
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,100
Now that you're here, I'm jealous.
- Silly.

663
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:33,600
No, really. I'm very afraid of him.
And of his father.

664
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:38,700
He wants me to keep a discrete eye on him.
- Why?

665
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,800
It goes back more than 20 years.

666
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:45,200
The old man had to work hard
in his new company.

667
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,900
One day he had to go to Africa
for 2 months.

668
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:53,600
Little Christophe stayed with his mother
and his sister, who was a baby still.

669
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:58,500
They had no staff yet, back then.
The mother died suddenly.

670
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,000
A heart attack. Totally unexpected.

671
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:07,200
Little Christophe was unshaken and
stayed with his dead mother

672
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:11,100
for almost two weeks,
without telling anybody.

673
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,600
Not even his father over the phone.

674
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,900
The body started to decompose.

675
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,200
The boy only moved
to feed his little sister.

676
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,000
How old was he?

677
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,500
Nine.

678
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:27,200
There were no consequences,
he was doing fine even.

679
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:31,400
Except, he wasn't afraid
of anything or anybody anymore.

680
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,600
He said: "We're just a piece of wood."

681
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,700
He kept saying he wanted
to attack the sun,

682
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:41,200
take it away from the earth
or set the world to fire with it.

683
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,200
he also said: "That would be criminal."

684
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:48,400
Or "Would that make
me as evil as God?"

685
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,200
Boy talk.

686
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,800
Except he still said it when he was 19
and when he was 25.

687
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:58,700
And he defied death,
in the air, with his car.

688
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,400
He manipulated people for fun

689
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,300
and he hung out with dangerous types,
to see whether they would kill him.

690
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,900
He pushed women to suicide.

691
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,500
Gossip.
- No.

692
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,200
He seduced a number of employees.

693
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,200
They say he tortured
and hurt them to the point

694
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,700
that two of them poured petrol over themselves

695
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,900
and set themselves on fire.

696
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,600
They buried alive in front of him.

697
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,000
Do you think he's mad?

698
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:30,600
He knows perfectly well what he's doing.

699
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,300
It's the women who are crazy.

700
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:37,700
Crazy about him. Especially if they know
about their predecessors.

701
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:40,500
I wanted to fire him

702
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,500
or at least put him out of action.
But that's impossible.

703
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:48,000
His father feels so guilty
he forgives him for everything.

704
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:52,300
Maybe, after his death, he'll give me
some control over his son.

705
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,000
That would be good.

706
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:57,200
Thanks to his relations,
Christophe's untouchable.

707
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,200
If he had the power,
he'd be terrifying.

708
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,400
I've been wanting to tell you for a while...

709
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,500
Why don't you get a replacement
for Mrs. Mercier?

710
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:12,400
But I'm constantly drowning in work.

711
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:15,600
They'd be on to us soon
and they'd start gossiping.

712
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,600
Not at all.
I have a friend who'd be suitable.

713
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,400
Please don't insist.

714
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,600
leave me alone.
Don't touch me.

715
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:35,900
Give it.

716
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,800
You didn't want to take the whole bottle, did you?

717
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:45,500
What's wrong?

718
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,100
Please... tell me.

719
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,600
Come on.

720
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,600
You don't want to tell me?

721
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,300
You should talk about it. It relieves.

722
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,700
You act like a girl in love
who was rejected.

723
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:23,600
Was it a man who wasn't available?

724
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,800
We're all the same.

725
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,900
You can't do anything for me.

726
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,700
It's nothing anyway.

727
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:33,900
I was just dreaming.

728
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,000
It'll pass.

729
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,600
All that counts...

730
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,000
is that we pursue our plan.

731
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:50,400
You've got Delacroix.

732
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:54,300
Convince him to replace Mrs. Mercier
with me.

733
01:06:55,700 --> 01:06:57,800
But never forget my advice.

734
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:02,700
Don't fall in love,
stick with comedy.

735
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,400
That doesn't hurt as much.

736
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,000
Yes?
- Mr. Delacroix? The personnel department.

737
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:12,200
Miss Tessier reported in sick
and will be absent for at least a week.

738
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,400
What's wrong with her?
- Stress from over fatigue.

739
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,000
Mr. Delacroix?

740
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:30,600
Mr. Delacroix,
the signatures please.

741
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,800
Come back in an hour.

742
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
It's urgent, sir.
- Please.

743
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:01,500
Come in.

744
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:09,700
I'd rather talk to you alone.

745
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,900
Why?
Nathalie can hear everything.

746
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,200
Are you in love with her?
- No.

747
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:30,100
What then?
- We both felt like it.

748
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,400
Isn't it the same with you?

749
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,600
That was not the same.
- It was.

750
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:42,500
Why did you do that to me?

751
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,000
I didn't want to see you again,
but it's not possible.

752
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,600
I wanted to kill you the other day.

753
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:55,800
I was in such pain I wanted to strangle you.

754
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,600
I'm not your daughter or your wife.

755
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,200
But I am your slave.

756
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,700
I'm in the office 13 hours a day.

757
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:12,200
Most evenings I'm with you.

758
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,600
And also on Saturdays and Sundays now.

759
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,800
And I have to be beautiful.

760
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:24,200
Beauty parlour, shopping,
the laundry on Saturdays.

761
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
But you refuse to help me.

762
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:29,500
Do you want me to leave my wife?

763
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,100
Do you want us to live together?
- No.

764
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,800
I only want a bit less work.

765
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,700
And for discretion's sake,
I want it to be Nathalie.

766
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,800
And I look the other way
when you two make love in the office?

767
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,700
I'm free.

768
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,600
When will you come to work again?

769
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,100
Maybe never.

770
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,400
What does it depend on?
- On you.

771
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,000
Sandrine?

772
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:31,400
I've been selfish.
When can your friend start?

773
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:05,700
The man entered hell.

774
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:48,600
Beat it, sister.
I'll see you at home tonight.

775
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,300
Come along, please.

776
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,500
Please wait here ladies.
Mr. Delacroix.

777
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,200
Sit down.

778
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,700
True enjoyment is rare.

779
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,400
Many women or people
will never know it.

780
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,400
It's a drug.

781
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:02,800
A she-devil that grabs you
and then keeps escaping.

782
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,700
You'll only live for her.

783
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:07,400
Not?

784
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:12,500
Your relationship with your wife and family
is none of my business.

785
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:15,800
In a way, I envy you.

786
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,000
Except, you work for the Barnay company.

787
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:25,000
You carry a huge responsibility.
Suppose everybody acted like you do.

788
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:31,400
The company would be one big fucking palace.
It wouldn't function anymore.

789
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:33,100
Unfortunately.

790
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,000
You should have been an example.

791
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,900
Am I saying things
you disagree with?

792
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,200
Well then.

793
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,800
This document states
what you did

794
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:55,400
with your two subordinates.
Sign it.

795
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:00,000
You also accept your dismissal
as a result of grave professional misconduct,

796
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:02,100
so without severance pay.

797
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:06,300
I'm being sacked.
- No.

798
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,200
I'll keep my mouth shut about the affair.

799
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,800
I'm placing you under surveillance.

800
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:16,300
Under surveillance of an assistant
of my choice, of course.

801
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,700
Right.

802
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,200
I'm expecting your signature.

803
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:37,300
Thank you.

804
01:18:58,300 --> 01:18:59,700
Poor loser.

805
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,300
What are you doing to him?

806
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:03,800
Did he pressure you?

807
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,800
Did he abuse his authority?
- No.

808
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,400
So you don't choose hypocrisy
as your defence.

809
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,800
Should I have?

810
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:18,100
Useful and socially acceptable vices
soon become virtues.

811
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,800
We appreciate the same truths.

812
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:30,600
First I thought he wanted to show off
his wealth. I thought it was vulgar.

813
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,600
But he was handsome.
I longed for him

814
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,400
and could forgive him anything.

815
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:37,800
Money.

816
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,300
It rules our dreams and desires...

817
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:44,500
determines the size of our prisons.

818
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:51,300
See ladies, just like you, I'm
going to have a taste of true freedom.

819
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,100
Dare to play with the social order...

820
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:58,300
whether it's just or not

821
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:01,200
or of divine or human origin.

822
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,100
I reject the rules...

823
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,400
the straitjacket.

824
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:07,800
I propose to you a game.

825
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:12,700
Nathalie, you go work with Delacroix again.
- Do you know each other?

826
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
We're lovers.

827
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,500
Well, sometimes.

828
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,500
Sandrine, I know all the employees.

829
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:24,400
I have a confidential file
about everybody.

830
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:28,400
And I'm often looking for distraction
one way or another

831
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,300
with one person or the next.

832
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:35,700
Nathalie has slowly replaced Delacroix.
Ok, not officially.

833
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,300
He's still my technical advisor.

834
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,300
And, in secret, she's

835
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,100
my eyes,

836
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,100
my ears,

837
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:47,300
my mouth.
- Also with me?

838
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Miss Sandrine Tessier...

839
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,600
it's my honour to ask for your hand...

840
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:57,700
for a temporary commitment.
A game.

841
01:20:58,500 --> 01:20:59,600
What kind of game?

842
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:03,500
Maybe the game of chance
or love.

843
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
A new form of entertainment.

844
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:06,900
Who will say?

845
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,500
For just a few months.
A game with a useful side to it.

846
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:15,500
My father will die soon.

847
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:18,700
And he's still hesitant

848
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:22,300
to trust me with his entire
empire.

849
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:29,000
He's heard rumours
saying I'm too whimsical,

850
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:33,900
too careless with people to be entrusted
with a large employee base.

851
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,000
But I want that power.

852
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:40,900
Because debauchery isn't possible
without money and protection.

853
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:44,900
"Depending whether thou
art mighty or poor..."

854
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,800
I disabled Delacroix.

855
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,800
My potential rival and guard dog.

856
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:53,000
But I'm not taking any risks.

857
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:58,100
Before my father dies, I want to
make him think I gained respectability

858
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:01,300
and seriousness as
a result of love.

859
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:05,000
This, of course, is a deal
you'll accept...

860
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:09,500
like the donkey, lured by the carrot
and threatened by the stick.

861
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:10,700
And what's the stick?

862
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,200
Immediate dismissal
and a public scandal.

863
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,300
And the carrot: I marry you.

864
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:19,600
for the law and for the church.

865
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:23,100
I insist on the church and on
community of property.

866
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,800
My father could be suspicious.
And not without reason.

867
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,400
The religious side
plus participation in my fortune.

868
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,100
will be a firm foundation of our
short lived amour fou.

869
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:41,600
Of course, in a couple of months
we'll divorce.

870
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,500
and you'll receive a generous allowance.

871
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:46,200
But we remain married in the eyes of the church.

872
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:51,100
I'll patiently await God's punishment.

873
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:56,700
Why me and not Nathalie?

874
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:02,200
Nathalie's more useful at the office,
to keep an eye on Delacroix.

875
01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:06,000
And you're a likelier candidate
as the young woman

876
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:10,000
from a working class background,
innocent, refreshing and lively.

877
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:12,800
Good for my image
as a dynamic employer.

878
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:16,400
Shall we start our game now?

879
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,600
You go to the ladies' bathrooms...

880
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:23,000
you get into a cubicle

881
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,400
and you start making love.
I'll join you in 5 minutes.

882
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:32,000
Wait for me before finishing.

883
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:54,200
And, Sandrine,
do you accept my game?

884
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:59,800
Will you continue your brilliant social rise
or end it?

885
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:20,700
Then, for the first time
I came with a man.

886
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:25,400
But I'm sure
he hadn't reached his climax yet.

887
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,400
Have you been lovers for long?

888
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,200
From when we started at Barnay's?

889
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:53,100
He knew things
that could only come from you.

890
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:58,700
He knew were he could catch us
with poor Delacroix.

891
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:03,200
Your mysterious lover
was Christophe.

892
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:07,300
Now I understand why you
warned me about him.

893
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:09,400
Shall I tell you something?

894
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:12,800
While you were manipulating Delacroix.

895
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,800
Christophe was manipulating me.

896
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,400
I thought I'd made him
fall in love.

897
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:22,000
How could I be that stupid?

898
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:25,200
Even though I wasn't naive anymore.

899
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:31,600
Well, he's stronger than you,
than me, then the two of us together.

900
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,600
He's had so many women,

901
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,400
so many people,
in bed or somewhere else

902
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,400
and in each possible combination

903
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:43,300
that love nor any other form of normal
sexuality can hold his interest.

904
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,800
And the tragic thing is that he loves enjoyment.

905
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,300
Do you know why he needs you?

906
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:54,800
Like he said: for the enjoyment of
playing with others on a large scale.

907
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:59,800
He already pushed women to commit suicide,
he'll be able to destroy many more.

908
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:02,800
And I cheat...

909
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,600
I lie to everybody.

910
01:27:06,700 --> 01:27:08,900
He leads me in everything.

911
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:15,900
I actually behave like a slave.

912
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,900
A slave who even enjoys it,
out of love.

913
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:24,700
You're talking nonsense.
Like a crazy woman.

914
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,700
Listen to what the crazy woman
reads in your little head.

915
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:33,100
You secretly hope he loves you.

916
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:36,200
Sometimes you even believe it.

917
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,400
You think that, at the very worst,

918
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:43,200
you keep your chances open
because you stay in the picture.

919
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,100
Well, you're dreaming, girl.

920
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:50,300
When you're no longer required and all used up,

921
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,400
he'll dump you like an old rag.

922
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:55,900
Why make such a scene about
a staged wedding?

923
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:57,800
I never had anything in my life.

924
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:01,700
Nothing and nobody.

925
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:04,400
You don't love him.
He's mine.

926
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:06,800
I won't let you or anybody else
take him from me.

927
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,900
Christophe had transferred me.

928
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:25,900
I now had my own office
at the Champs Elysées.

929
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:29,900
Sandrine?

930
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:35,600
Can I talk to you?

931
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,000
Are you ok?

932
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:50,200
I wanted to tell you
that everything's over between us.

933
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:52,400
And it's better that way.

934
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:55,600
But out of everything that happened,
I'll remember one thing.

935
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:59,800
You gave me some of the only moments
of real happiness in my life,

936
01:29:00,300 --> 01:29:02,000
of intense passion,

937
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,000
of pain,

938
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,300
but also of great tenderness.

939
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:10,100
I will always keep you in my heart.

940
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,800
That's what I wanted to say.
The rest doesn't matter.

941
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:19,200
Take good care of yourself, Sandrine.

942
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,100
Goodbye.

943
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,600
This man wasn't after revenge.

944
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:34,300
I only realised later that he loved me...

945
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:38,100
with an intensity I couldn't comprehend,

946
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:41,300
without expecting anything in return,
not even my presence.

947
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:46,800
I should have been very touched,
but back then I only thought of him as a weak man.

948
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:53,200
Besides, I was pining for a phone call
from Christophe. And then...

949
01:29:56,700 --> 01:30:01,700
Make yourself very beautiful tonight.
Charlotte will pick you up at midnight.

950
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:17,200
You'll become my sister-in-law.
The only one before God.

951
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:21,000
For a very short time.
- A day, a month, a year.

952
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,600
What's that in the face of eternity?

953
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:26,700
My new sister.

954
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:28,800
Welcome among us.

955
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,600
I only ask one thing of you.
Be who you are.

956
01:30:36,700 --> 01:30:39,000
We're born in a world of lies.

957
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Be nice to us,
genuine...

958
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:45,000
and never lie to us.

959
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:49,800
Christophe and I
always speak the truth.

960
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:54,400
Especially when the truth hurts
or burns.

961
01:30:56,100 --> 01:31:00,600
Let the party begin.
And may we all enjoy ourselves.

962
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:13,400
Charlotte, get up.

963
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,800
Sandrine, you too.

964
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:02,400
Sandrine, stand against her back.

965
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:07,300
Caress her neck.

966
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:12,700
Her arms.

967
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:18,600
Her breasts.

968
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:25,500
Everything I do to you,
you should do to Charlotte.

969
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:29,900
I open your dress.

970
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,600
I take it off.

971
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,200
I caress your breasts...

972
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,000
your belly...

973
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:03,000
the inside of your thighs.

974
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:23,100
How dare you spoil my pleasure?

975
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:27,600
Why do you choose them?
I can still pleasure you the way you taught me.

976
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,700
Why do you reject me?

977
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:33,200
Where did you get the key?

978
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:40,700
I'm from another race than all the women
you seduced and rejected.

979
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:44,000
I'll never commit suicide.
I won't give you the satisfaction.

980
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:47,500
Never.

981
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,000
But you're nothing anymore.

982
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,900
Tomorrow, the lock will be changed.

983
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:59,500
Today, I see you for the last time.
And give back that key.

984
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:01,200
Come and get it.

985
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,000
I repeat.

986
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:07,400
I'm stronger than all those you rejected.
- Give it back!

987
01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:08,700
Come and get it.

988
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:12,800
Hit me.

989
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,900
You taught me how pain
can lead to pleasure.

990
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,200
I never want to see you again.

991
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:39,500
Can't you see I'm suffering?

992
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:41,000
That means you're alive.

993
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:44,300
Unfortunately.

994
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:53,800
But creatures like you are like dogs.

995
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:56,800
Unfortunately, I need you at the office.

996
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:00,600
But as soon as my father dies,
you disappear.

997
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:03,400
For me you already don't exist anymore.

998
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:11,800
I'll give you a new party
that's worthy of you. I promise.

999
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:21,800
I can still help him
and protect him.

1000
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,500
You'll only be hated more.

1001
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:27,100
Which means he loves me.

1002
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:33,300
I have no more pride or dignity.

1003
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:35,000
I've got nothing left.

1004
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:38,400
Give me the money
you owe me.

1005
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:42,000
The next day
I went to get my savings.

1006
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:45,000
I gave her everything I had,
which wasn't much.

1007
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:48,900
She took the notes
and sat on the ground.

1008
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:51,900
She counted them en counted them again.

1009
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:55,800
I no longer existed.

1010
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:59,300
She sat there
on the floor of her apartment,

1011
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:01,700
looking almost ugly
with her eyes closed tight.

1012
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,400
She counted and recounted difficult things
using her fingers.

1013
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:09,700
I was never more touched by her than then.

1014
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:16,200
For the first time, without wanting it,
I had the heart of a 15 year old girl.

1015
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,700
I couldn't believe it.
My husband was so beautiful.

1016
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:23,100
And I was wearing my white wedding dress.

1017
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:26,700
Christophe had chosen the tactics
of the surprise wedding.

1018
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:30,400
I was only going to be introduced
to father Barnay the next day.

1019
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:32,200
And then there was Nathalie.

1020
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:35,300
Christophe had gotten her
a restraining order.

1021
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:39,200
When I came outside, I suddenly saw her.

1022
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:43,400
Our eyes met.

1023
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:45,100
She hated me.

1024
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:54,200
Admire this beautiful symbol
of our worldly lives.

1025
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:10,700
"And I am the death of everything

1026
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:14,000
and I am the birth of everything.

1027
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:17,800
Word and memory,
stability and mercifulness

1028
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,200
and the silence of the secret things."

1029
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Sir, your father just passed away.

1030
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:40,000
Our father is no longer alive.

1031
01:39:42,100 --> 01:39:43,200
He just passed away.

1032
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:50,700
He left me as only president
of the group.

1033
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:53,400
Isn't that a beautiful coincidence?

1034
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:55,800
The president is dead!

1035
01:39:56,700 --> 01:40:00,200
Long live the president.
And tonight

1036
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:03,400
more than  all other nights:
Love each other.

1037
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:12,600
Oh, my sister...

1038
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:18,000
"You cry for people
you shouldn't cry for.

1039
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:22,600
A wise man doesn't mourn
the living or the dead,

1040
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:24,900
since we have never been,

1041
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:30,000
me... nor you...
nor these kings...

1042
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:33,000
and never shall we
cease to be."

1043
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:49,700
Finally we enter
the kingdom of princes,

1044
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:52,700
pharaohs and gods.

1045
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:05,100
Please, stop!

1046
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:41,500
You had no right to treat me this way.

1047
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:45,400
Am I more cruel than life
and creation?

1048
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:49,800
More cruel then the Creator,
if He exists?

1049
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:54,900
Have you watched the violence of death
on the faces of the creatures?

1050
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:58,400
Alive we are like chained gods...

1051
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:03,100
most of the time too cowardly
to taste real freedom.

1052
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:05,800
Vanity of vanities.

1053
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:08,800
Only death is the big cleansing.

1054
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:14,200
You might have helped me
to skilfully plan

1055
01:43:14,400 --> 01:43:16,600
the fate of man.

1056
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:19,400
You could even have brought me the sun.

1057
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,300
A shame.

1058
01:43:40,900 --> 01:43:44,100
Once the divorce is settled,
you're free.

1059
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,800
It will take a couple of weeks.

1060
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:04,700
You again?

1061
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:06,800
Leave us alone.

1062
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:13,500
Look at me.

1063
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,800
What's the use?
You don't exist anymore.

1064
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:06,600
No, don't do that.

1065
01:45:09,100 --> 01:45:11,000
I'd see you again up there.

1066
01:45:13,300 --> 01:45:16,200
To aggravate us, me,

1067
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:20,200
the devil and all my other fellow players.

1068
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:24,500
To endure you until eternity...

1069
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:26,000
How horrible.

1070
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:29,000
The police came.
Nathalie was cuffed and taken away.

1071
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,300
She never answered the question
everybody asked:

1072
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:34,200
Why?

1073
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,500
The media got on to the case,

1074
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:40,200
but the essential truth
remained carefully hidden.

1075
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:45,700
Nathalie was sentenced to years in jail
and the case was forgotten.

1076
01:47:47,500 --> 01:47:50,700
Married in community of property
and widowed so quickly,

1077
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:55,900
I automatically became the heiress
of my legal husband.

1078
01:47:56,500 --> 01:48:00,500
With Charlotte I ruled the empire
here brother had wanted so badly,

1079
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:03,900
with the expert assistance of Delacroix,

1080
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:07,100
who proved to be a discrete
and loyal employee.

1081
01:48:07,300 --> 01:48:08,900
Life went on.

1082
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,400
After her sentence, Nathalie married

1083
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:14,800
her prison guard.

1084
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:19,000
Of the three of us, she's the only one
who really married.

1085
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:24,200
Years later,
I happened to see her.

1086
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:27,700
There she was...

1087
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:29,700
with her husband and child.

1088
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:34,200
They all looked nice.

1089
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:39,500
After a while we approached
each other.

1090
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,300
We looked at each other.

1091
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:43,900
In silence.

1092
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:48,900
I only saw her.

1093
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:55,400
Then we had to go our ways.

1094
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:58,400
We kept looking at each other...

1095
01:48:59,500 --> 01:49:01,800
knowing it was the last time.

1096
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:05,600
Then she bent over to me

1097
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:07,600
and asked for forgiveness.

1098
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:10,400
Me.

1099
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:14,700
We looked at each other one last time

1100
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:16,500
and then I kissed her.

1101
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:38,800
Then she walked on,

1102
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:41,100
with her husband and child

1103
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:42,900
and disappeared.

1104
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:45,400
Forever.

1105
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:03,300
And for the rest of my life,
every day that went by,

1106
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:05,500
I'd think about her
at least once.
