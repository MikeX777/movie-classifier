1
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:08,547
Don't mind him.

2
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,041
Shit!

3
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:57,005
Motherfucker!

4
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,297
Motherfucker!

5
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:04,323
Fucking animal!

6
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,164
Kwesi!

7
00:04:09,664 --> 00:04:10,831
Out!

8
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,664
That's so gross.

9
00:04:15,664 --> 00:04:17,206
Vile creature!

10
00:04:34,748 --> 00:04:37,706
- What's wrong?
- It peed at the front door again.

11
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:45,248
Kwesi, Kwesi...

12
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:48,956
Come here.

13
00:04:53,206 --> 00:04:55,664
You can't pee here.

14
00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:57,956
You're wasting your time, hun.

15
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,789
That cat is crazy, or it wants revenge.

16
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:09,498
Mum, Pedro's here.

17
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:12,581
Why didn't you open the door?

18
00:05:13,206 --> 00:05:14,331
Huh?

19
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:16,539
- How did it go?
- Well.

20
00:05:16,706 --> 00:05:20,456
I've got everything we need
to get this done once and for all.

21
00:05:20,623 --> 00:05:21,831
- Coffee?
- No need.

22
00:05:21,998 --> 00:05:25,456
Who's the prettiest cat in the world?

23
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:28,164
Kwesi, what's wrong?

24
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,081
Stop...

25
00:05:32,664 --> 00:05:33,831
Kwesi!

26
00:05:54,956 --> 00:05:59,164
<i>Free dental care is provided
to young people and children</i>

27
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:01,956
<i>in different schools around the country.</i>

28
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:05,456
What do you want?

29
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:07,414
What are you watching?

30
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:09,248
Nothing.

31
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,206
Delicious.

32
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,373
Perfect.

33
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:30,706
Why don't you turn that down, huh?

34
00:06:36,414 --> 00:06:37,507
Great!

35
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:40,539
You know what I dreamt?

36
00:06:40,706 --> 00:06:43,248
That we were painting my room purple.

37
00:06:43,414 --> 00:06:44,414
Purple?

38
00:06:44,956 --> 00:06:46,373
Purple again?

39
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:49,206
You're always thinking about purple.

40
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:52,498
I don't know what purple means in dreams.

41
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:55,498
It's an ambivalent colour, I'll look it up.

42
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:58,206
I think mauve means...

43
00:06:58,373 --> 00:07:01,289
Mum, stop making stuff up.

44
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,081
Go take a shower, Eva.

45
00:07:04,248 --> 00:07:05,914
And tidy your room.

46
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:10,206
- Are you gonna throw this stuff away?
- Turn it up!

47
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:11,806
Tell me!

48
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,498
- Coming through.
- Sorry.

49
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:16,248
- Are you throwing all of that away?
- Turn it up.

50
00:07:17,873 --> 00:07:20,081
- Why did you turn it down?
- Cos I wanted to.

51
00:07:20,248 --> 00:07:21,456
- Turn it up!
- No.

52
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:23,289
- Turn it up.
- Mum!

53
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:25,289
- Turn it up.
- What's going on?

54
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:28,748
Louder!

55
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:30,914
Calm down.

56
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:33,039
Hi, ladies.

57
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:35,206
What's with the bickering?

58
00:07:35,373 --> 00:07:36,664
Don't fight.

59
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:39,164
Honey.

60
00:07:39,331 --> 00:07:41,998
- Mum already checked.
- OK, hun.

61
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:46,748
Hello, yes? Hi, Flor.

62
00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:47,956
Again?

63
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:49,873
I won't say it again. Go wash.

64
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,998
- Calm down!
- Turn it up!

65
00:07:52,164 --> 00:07:54,706
- Mum!
- Eva, I won't say it again.

66
00:07:54,873 --> 00:07:56,039
Go take a shower.

67
00:07:56,206 --> 00:07:58,789
- What are you going to do with that?
- Go.

68
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:01,498
Flor's place got broken into again.

69
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,081
That's so awful.

70
00:08:05,164 --> 00:08:06,873
Yeah, definitely...

71
00:08:11,248 --> 00:08:13,289
You OK with her throwing everything out?

72
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:17,039
It needs to be thrown away anyway.
The cat weed on everything.

73
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,414
Let go of me!

74
00:08:20,581 --> 00:08:22,914
- Why? Does it hurt?
- Yes, it hurts. Let go.

75
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:26,581
- Why?
- You're hurting me, let go.

76
00:08:26,748 --> 00:08:29,581
- It hurts?
- Yes, it hurts, let go!

77
00:08:29,748 --> 00:08:32,164
- Focus, it doesn't hurt that much.
- Let go!

78
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:34,664
What are you doing, you savage?
How old are you?

79
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:36,289
Let go of her!

80
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:44,664
We had a deal.

81
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:47,956
Remember?

82
00:08:48,123 --> 00:08:50,539
I don't want any violence in this house.

83
00:09:29,664 --> 00:09:31,164
She's unbearable.

84
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:35,414
Impossible.

85
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:39,539
She's possessed by the same demon.

86
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,039
I don't recognise her anymore.

87
00:09:48,373 --> 00:09:53,998
I HAVE ELECTRIC DREAMS

88
00:10:03,456 --> 00:10:04,748
Puff your cheeks out.

89
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:07,123
- What?
- Puff your cheeks out!

90
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:34,498
You like the beard?

91
00:10:40,456 --> 00:10:41,873
Not really.

92
00:11:03,123 --> 00:11:04,956
<i>I have electric dreams</i>

93
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:09,873
<i>A pack of wild animals</i>

94
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,556
<i>Scream their love for each other</i>

95
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:15,956
<i>Sometimes with blows</i>

96
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,552
I have electric dreams

97
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:24,103
A pack of wild animals

98
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:27,514
Scream their love for each other

99
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:29,039
Sometimes with blows.

100
00:11:29,206 --> 00:11:30,269
Well?

101
00:11:31,873 --> 00:11:33,581
Doesn't it have an ending?

102
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:36,331
It's a poem, not a novel.

103
00:11:37,123 --> 00:11:39,873
- Is that a translation?
- No, I wrote it.

104
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,748
- I didn't know you wrote.
- I'm starting to.

105
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:44,706
I have to go over it.

106
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,498
Dad, you can't smoke here.

107
00:11:49,664 --> 00:11:50,706
Why not?

108
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:54,956
I'm a regular here.

109
00:11:57,294 --> 00:11:58,503
Can I try?

110
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:11,164
When I live with you, can I smoke?

111
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:14,831
- Your mum won't like it.
- So?

112
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:18,789
You'll get into more trouble with her.

113
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:22,331
She's unbearable.

114
00:12:23,373 --> 00:12:24,414
Why?

115
00:12:25,081 --> 00:12:27,873
- Her inheritance just came in, right?
- Exactly.

116
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,873
The house is a mess
cos of all the work going on.

117
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:32,706
Nobody can stand her anymore.

118
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:35,039
- Hi, Martín, all good?
- Hi.

119
00:12:35,206 --> 00:12:36,956
- Can I clear your plates?
- Yeah.

120
00:12:41,331 --> 00:12:44,081
Why can't I stay with you over the holidays?

121
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,164
It's complicated.

122
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:50,081
I've just moved in with another friend.

123
00:12:50,248 --> 00:12:51,289
Again?

124
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:55,373
Didn't you take a look
at the listings I sent you?

125
00:12:56,581 --> 00:12:58,123
Not yet.

126
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,956
It went into my eye.

127
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:16,289
I think this is my last one.

128
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,414
I got a new mark.

129
00:13:20,998 --> 00:13:22,456
Another mark?

130
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:26,539
I think the doc's gonna tell me
I have cancer.

131
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:30,498
- I need to make the most of it.
- Let's see, show me.

132
00:13:34,263 --> 00:13:36,721
Yeah, there's a mark.

133
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:57,297
There.

134
00:13:57,456 --> 00:13:58,748
- Bye.
- Bye.

135
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:01,123
Wait, you smell of cigarettes.

136
00:14:06,456 --> 00:14:07,581
Here you go.

137
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:10,623
- Better?
- Let's see.

138
00:14:12,998 --> 00:14:14,081
All good.

139
00:14:14,706 --> 00:14:17,498
Wait, tell Sol that...

140
00:14:18,748 --> 00:14:21,164
I'll swing by
so all three of us can go for a walk

141
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:22,956
and send her my love, OK?

142
00:14:23,498 --> 00:14:25,206
Yeah, I'll tell Mum.

143
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:27,581
How's your mum doing?

144
00:14:27,748 --> 00:14:28,914
Good.

145
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:30,389
OK.

146
00:14:30,414 --> 00:14:31,998
Dad, you're squeezing me.

147
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:34,498
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

148
00:14:34,664 --> 00:14:35,748
Sorry.

149
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:40,248
- Bye.
- Bye!

150
00:16:47,081 --> 00:16:51,789
As I was saying, all the walls are concrete.

151
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:54,873
You can hang some pictures up.

152
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,081
There's a small room, a laundry room.

153
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:03,539
The kitchen, you could put an oven here.

154
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:05,998
The bathroom.

155
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:12,664
There's a small problem
with the shower cables.

156
00:17:13,456 --> 00:17:15,831
So, when you move the shower around,

157
00:17:15,998 --> 00:17:18,581
try not to use too much pressure.

158
00:17:18,748 --> 00:17:22,539
Otherwise, there'll be too much water
and it'll wet the cable.

159
00:17:22,706 --> 00:17:25,581
It's dangerous,
but you won't get electrocuted.

160
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:28,373
- Is it safe?
- Yes, it's safe.

161
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:31,373
- And the toilet?
- It's new.

162
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:33,456
So is the sink.

163
00:17:39,373 --> 00:17:41,289
Dad, there's only one bedroom.

164
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:44,825
So?

165
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:47,914
It's small, there's no room.
Where am I supposed to go?

166
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:51,206
It works for me.

167
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:53,206
Does the missus not like it?

168
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,289
That's my daughter.

169
00:17:56,456 --> 00:17:57,998
Apologies.

170
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:00,206
The neighbourhood, is it safe?

171
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:03,581
Yes, it's calmer now,
a church opened up here recently.

172
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:06,081
So, it's a calm neighbourhood.

173
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:09,373
Don't tell me the parishioners
are the type to sing at 5 am.

174
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:10,748
No, it's changed.

175
00:18:10,914 --> 00:18:13,664
They don't start before midday.

176
00:18:14,664 --> 00:18:17,998
The problem is that we like our lie-ins.

177
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:44,248
What's wrong?

178
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:46,456
Nothing, I'm tired.

179
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:51,998
Nothing else?

180
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:57,664
I sent you,
like, a thousand apartment listings.

181
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,998
They were expensive.

182
00:19:08,706 --> 00:19:09,748
He's cute.

183
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:11,914
He looks dumb.

184
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:14,248
- Let me take a look!
- He's not ugly!

185
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:18,456
He's ugly
and he's got wannabe musician vibes.

186
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:20,539
He's hot, right?

187
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:23,414
- He has a puppy!
- He looks like he'd suit Eva.

188
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:26,206
Yeah, and he has a little dog!

189
00:19:27,248 --> 00:19:29,498
- He's hot.
- No, he looks dumb.

190
00:19:29,664 --> 00:19:34,206
Look, I found an apartment with a bathtub.

191
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:37,456
But look at the address,
it's not even in San José.

192
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:42,206
Get it all off,
I think I've got more here too.

193
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:45,914
- You need to wear sunscreen.
- No, it's nothing.

194
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:47,914
Aren't you going to the beach?

195
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:50,123
No, we can't.

196
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,414
Why aren't you going with your dad?

197
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:54,789
- We're not allowed to.
- Seriously?

198
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:55,952
Shut up.

199
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,248
We're not going
cos Mum's busy with the house.

200
00:19:58,414 --> 00:20:01,123
- Why?
- She got an inheritance.

201
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:03,289
- Who died?
- An aunt.

202
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:05,581
- Nobody knew her.
- Really?

203
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:07,373
Nobody knew her.

204
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,623
Shut up.

205
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:26,123
What are you saying?

206
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:28,331
What are they saying?

207
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:31,998
<i>Pamela blows</i>

208
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,706
<i>Pamela blows</i>

209
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,873
Hands in the air, everyone!

210
00:21:27,998 --> 00:21:30,081
Its head is becoming bigger and bigger

211
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,039
and its nose flatter and flatter.

212
00:21:32,206 --> 00:21:36,414
And it's starting to grow nasty f-f-f...

213
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:40,456
fangs!

214
00:21:40,623 --> 00:21:44,748
<i>The show's about to start, enter, enter.</i>

215
00:21:47,331 --> 00:21:50,164
<i>The pretty girl I promised you
is at the entrance.</i>

216
00:21:50,331 --> 00:21:51,664
She's 18.

217
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:54,956
<i>She's made waves
across the whole of America.</i>

218
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,289
<i>The mysterious space grows dark</i>

219
00:21:59,456 --> 00:22:02,039
<i>and the window is slowly opening.</i>

220
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,873
<i>And there you have it!</i>

221
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,789
<i>As usual, she comes out
and greets the audience with a...</i>

222
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,539
<i>It really is a girl in the flesh,</i>

223
00:22:15,706 --> 00:22:18,998
<i>just like each of you enjoying this show.</i>

224
00:22:19,164 --> 00:22:22,414
<i>Now open your eyes, my friends...</i>

225
00:22:22,581 --> 00:22:25,706
<i>Don't let her out of your sight</i>

226
00:22:25,873 --> 00:22:27,998
<i>because with every minute that passes,</i>

227
00:22:28,164 --> 00:22:29,206
<i>her face...</i>

228
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:31,706
<i>Her transformation will be drastic,</i>

229
00:22:31,873 --> 00:22:35,123
<i>both physical and supernatural, my friends.</i>

230
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:37,623
<i>I feel like the animal's moving.</i>

231
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:42,248
Careful, careful, careful...

232
00:24:22,164 --> 00:24:23,581
What are you doing?

233
00:24:25,373 --> 00:24:28,914
- That's enough. Leave her.
- Diana, don't be stubborn.

234
00:24:29,081 --> 00:24:30,539
I don't wanna...

235
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:34,123
What's wrong?

236
00:24:35,414 --> 00:24:37,831
You know I can't take you home like this.

237
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:39,831
Calm down!

238
00:24:47,123 --> 00:24:48,248
Please.

239
00:24:53,647 --> 00:24:54,654
Hi.

240
00:24:55,914 --> 00:24:57,498
Did you go to carnival?

241
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:01,789
Hold on a sec.

242
00:25:02,831 --> 00:25:04,706
- I want a fag.
- Later.

243
00:25:04,873 --> 00:25:07,748
- What a nice house.
- No, don't touch that.

244
00:25:07,914 --> 00:25:10,373
Diana, that belongs to the homeowner.

245
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:11,428
Eva!

246
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:13,706
Dad, she's drunk, I can't do anything.

247
00:25:14,414 --> 00:25:16,164
You've got a beard now?

248
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:19,456
- Didn't you have one before?
- No.

249
00:25:19,623 --> 00:25:20,998
It makes you look older.

250
00:25:21,164 --> 00:25:23,623
I think it's cos of your grey hairs.

251
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:24,873
Thanks, Diana.

252
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,039
- You've got grey hairs, sir.
- No need for the formalities.

253
00:25:28,206 --> 00:25:30,581
That's why you look older.

254
00:25:30,748 --> 00:25:33,081
I probably do look older.

255
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:38,539
Or maybe you're the ones who are too young?

256
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:40,414
I'm going to get you some water.

257
00:25:53,956 --> 00:25:55,664
But it suits you.

258
00:25:56,748 --> 00:26:00,831
- Really?
- It's cool, you look good like that.

259
00:26:04,456 --> 00:26:06,123
- Let's go, Diana.
- In a bit...

260
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:08,748
- I'm talking to you.
- Wait till she's feeling better.

261
00:26:10,956 --> 00:26:12,373
Get up!

262
00:26:14,081 --> 00:26:16,373
- I think I'm gonna throw up.
- No, no!

263
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:22,079
Stop.

264
00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:28,914
You like my boobs?

265
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,456
Lift your arm up.

266
00:26:32,331 --> 00:26:33,664
You like them?

267
00:26:35,123 --> 00:26:37,914
Here.
Bicarbonate and lemon for the nausea.

268
00:26:38,873 --> 00:26:40,539
Stay over there.

269
00:26:48,498 --> 00:26:49,789
Diana's right.

270
00:26:50,414 --> 00:26:52,581
I should shave.

271
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:55,498
What's up with you?

272
00:27:11,123 --> 00:27:13,248
Funny that you guys are so close, huh?

273
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:14,467
Why?

274
00:27:15,998 --> 00:27:19,581
I don't know,
I've always found her a bit more...

275
00:27:19,748 --> 00:27:21,123
A bit more what?

276
00:27:23,914 --> 00:27:25,331
Kind of loose.

277
00:28:04,373 --> 00:28:06,039
Where were you?

278
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:11,289
Why are you dressed like that?

279
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,456
Diana's mum called last night.

280
00:28:15,498 --> 00:28:16,873
Where did you sleep?

281
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,206
Tell me the truth, where did you sleep?

282
00:28:23,873 --> 00:28:27,248
- What's with all the questions?
- I just want to know.

283
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,623
Kwesi!

284
00:28:33,748 --> 00:28:36,331
When were you going to tell me
where you were going to sleep?

285
00:28:36,914 --> 00:28:38,581
Diana's mum called.

286
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:42,039
Am I not allowed to sleep at my dad's?

287
00:28:42,206 --> 00:28:43,664
It's not even his place.

288
00:28:44,498 --> 00:28:46,123
What's that guy called?

289
00:28:48,914 --> 00:28:50,414
Are you throwing this away?

290
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:54,331
They're costumes from old shows.

291
00:28:55,706 --> 00:28:57,289
I'm throwing it all out.

292
00:28:58,539 --> 00:28:59,581
And this?

293
00:29:00,164 --> 00:29:02,289
Why don't you give it to Martita?

294
00:29:03,206 --> 00:29:04,748
No, I want everything out.

295
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:07,998
Konnichiwa.

296
00:29:11,706 --> 00:29:13,581
That dress is too big for you.

297
00:29:14,998 --> 00:29:17,039
You got those boobs from your dad.

298
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:18,956
Drop it, Mum.

299
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:21,623
I'm 16, they could still grow.

300
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:25,498
- You know what I dreamt about?
- What?

301
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:28,123
That we were on a beach and...

302
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:29,748
that we lived underwater.

303
00:29:29,914 --> 00:29:32,748
Did you like living underwater?

304
00:29:33,998 --> 00:29:36,081
We came across some funky creatures.

305
00:29:36,706 --> 00:29:38,581
Like a vampire squid.

306
00:29:38,748 --> 00:29:40,414
Water in dreams represents

307
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:43,081
memories of being in your mum's womb.

308
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:55,581
Which grocer's?

309
00:29:55,748 --> 00:30:00,414
"La Luna ", on 300 south, 50 east.

310
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:04,164
- I put it on the GPS.
- This one?

311
00:30:14,956 --> 00:30:18,331
- Are you sure it's here?
- That's what the ad said.

312
00:30:20,498 --> 00:30:21,998
Can you carry me?

313
00:30:22,164 --> 00:30:24,873
- It doesn't seem like it's there...
- Carry me, Dad!

314
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,706
No, you're too old for that.

315
00:30:26,873 --> 00:30:29,789
Why? I can carry you,
I'm very strong.

316
00:30:29,956 --> 00:30:32,248
Eva, stop.

317
00:30:47,498 --> 00:30:49,123
You're already very heavy.

318
00:30:52,873 --> 00:30:53,873
Look.

319
00:30:56,706 --> 00:30:57,752
Yelina.

320
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:00,539
What a strange name.

321
00:31:00,706 --> 00:31:03,664
I DREAMT OF YOU, YELINA

322
00:31:09,831 --> 00:31:11,456
Are you sure it's here?

323
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:14,789
Maybe you noted down the wrong address?

324
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:46,581
I'm gonna see who it is.

325
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:09,414
Is that your mum?

326
00:32:13,248 --> 00:32:14,254
Yes.

327
00:32:15,081 --> 00:32:16,414
It's a nice pic.

328
00:32:17,998 --> 00:32:19,456
Do I look like her?

329
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,164
Yeah, kinda.

330
00:32:28,324 --> 00:32:29,373
Dove.

331
00:32:30,706 --> 00:32:31,789
Everything OK?

332
00:32:31,956 --> 00:32:34,289
Do you need beer for this evening?

333
00:32:34,456 --> 00:32:35,998
It's fine, see you later.

334
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:37,373
I've got beer.

335
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,081
- OK, great, later.
- Hi, hope it all goes well.

336
00:32:40,706 --> 00:32:41,789
Thanks.

337
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:49,164
Sandra is lending us a mattress.

338
00:32:49,331 --> 00:32:50,456
Really?

339
00:32:53,873 --> 00:32:55,039
But it's dirty.

340
00:32:59,123 --> 00:33:01,164
If only that mattress could talk.

341
00:33:14,498 --> 00:33:15,914
What are you looking for?

342
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:18,456
Money for cigarettes.

343
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:20,748
- Doesn't your mum give you money?
- No.

344
00:33:21,748 --> 00:33:25,331
But she's got loads of money.

345
00:33:25,498 --> 00:33:28,623
- It's your job when I'm with you.
- Funny.

346
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:30,873
Cheeky.

347
00:33:36,498 --> 00:33:37,598
Who is it?

348
00:33:37,623 --> 00:33:40,248
People who are coming for the workshop.

349
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:43,498
It's a poetry workshop, organised by Dove.

350
00:33:44,873 --> 00:33:46,664
And you're going to take part?

351
00:33:46,831 --> 00:33:49,164
Yes, he likes my work.

352
00:33:49,873 --> 00:33:52,581
He says I have melancholic power.

353
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:00,998
"Melancholic".

354
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:05,539
This mattress isn't inflating,
it must have a hole.

355
00:34:12,331 --> 00:34:15,914
Did I already tell you about the time
I had blue marks on my knees?

356
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:18,456
No, you've never told me.

357
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,373
I went to the doctor

358
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:24,164
and he asked me
if something had happened to me,

359
00:34:24,706 --> 00:34:27,164
something serious, like a death,

360
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:30,789
an accident, that kind of thing.

361
00:34:32,081 --> 00:34:33,956
I said: "No...

362
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:36,956
I'm in love."

363
00:34:38,998 --> 00:34:40,831
Have you ever been in love?

364
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,342
No.

365
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:33,335
Hi.

366
00:35:34,081 --> 00:35:36,331
- You good?
- Yeah.

367
00:35:36,498 --> 00:35:37,956
You got a cigarette?

368
00:35:38,123 --> 00:35:39,664
I don't smoke.

369
00:35:40,248 --> 00:35:41,498
And a beer?

370
00:35:41,914 --> 00:35:45,164
They're outside,
but I'll go get some ice in a minute.

371
00:35:45,331 --> 00:35:47,498
OK, never mind.

372
00:35:47,664 --> 00:35:49,081
How old are you?

373
00:35:49,706 --> 00:35:52,081
- Why?
- Just curious.

374
00:35:53,956 --> 00:35:56,706
Are you Anca and Martín's daughter?

375
00:35:57,331 --> 00:35:58,344
Yes.

376
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:01,164
- How's your mum doing?
- Good.

377
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:05,206
- Is she still dancing?
- No, she retired.

378
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,206
OK, tell her that Diego said hi.

379
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:25,039
- Hi.
- All good?

380
00:36:25,206 --> 00:36:26,414
All good.

381
00:36:29,248 --> 00:36:30,706
Have you got a cigarette?

382
00:36:35,123 --> 00:36:36,623
Got something to drink?

383
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:38,873
I've got Sprite and Coke.

384
00:36:40,248 --> 00:36:41,414
A beer?

385
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:44,414
I do, but they're warm.

386
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:47,914
Thanks.

387
00:36:50,956 --> 00:36:53,081
How long have you known my dad for?

388
00:36:54,164 --> 00:36:55,581
Ages.

389
00:36:55,748 --> 00:36:57,873
We used to play in a band together.

390
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:59,331
Really?

391
00:37:01,081 --> 00:37:04,748
Yeah, I was surprised
when they got divorced.

392
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:10,123
He said he was looking for a place,
I'm putting him up in the meantime.

393
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:12,831
Yeah, I'm helping him look for apartments.

394
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:14,331
Really?

395
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,373
Yeah, it's going to be our place.

396
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:21,498
Is Dove your real name?

397
00:37:24,081 --> 00:37:26,539
No, my name's José Paolo.

398
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:29,539
Why do they call you Dove?

399
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,164
Who knows?

400
00:37:32,789 --> 00:37:33,914
What do you mean?

401
00:37:34,081 --> 00:37:35,956
Why do they call you that?

402
00:37:38,373 --> 00:37:41,956
A few years back,
we were out with some friends.

403
00:37:42,123 --> 00:37:45,581
We'd taken some stuff.

404
00:37:45,748 --> 00:37:47,581
We were heading to Coronado.

405
00:37:48,623 --> 00:37:50,581
And there was this kind of ravine.

406
00:37:51,498 --> 00:37:54,289
I climbed a rock

407
00:37:54,456 --> 00:37:55,581
and jumped off.

408
00:37:56,123 --> 00:37:59,123
I broke a few ribs and my collar bone.

409
00:38:01,081 --> 00:38:03,456
So, what does that have to do with Dove?

410
00:38:05,914 --> 00:38:10,164
People said
that I wanted to fly like a bird.

411
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:12,248
People say stuff.

412
00:38:21,164 --> 00:38:23,123
I fell once too.

413
00:38:24,456 --> 00:38:26,373
It was bad, I got three stitches.

414
00:38:27,581 --> 00:38:28,873
I see.

415
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:33,456
That's nothing,
I've got scars worse than that.

416
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,059
Let's see.

417
00:38:38,456 --> 00:38:39,706
What happened?

418
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:44,206
I don't know, I cut myself
when I was young and stupid.

419
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:55,706
Let's start the second half of the workshop

420
00:38:55,873 --> 00:38:58,248
where we'll read our work

421
00:38:58,414 --> 00:39:00,206
and comment on it, so...

422
00:39:02,414 --> 00:39:04,623
This passage is called "Vulva".

423
00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:06,789
- Vulva?
- Vulva, yes.

424
00:39:06,956 --> 00:39:08,123
So...

425
00:39:09,873 --> 00:39:11,123
Go on!

426
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:12,914
Licking pussy

427
00:39:14,164 --> 00:39:16,414
Licking pussy is the excellent excess of sex

428
00:39:16,581 --> 00:39:19,123
At 100 degrees Celsius
or 200 degrees Fahrenheit

429
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:23,039
Licking pussy, is an altruistic act
because one likes...

430
00:39:23,206 --> 00:39:25,706
That's Luis, he runs the workshop.

431
00:39:29,289 --> 00:39:30,331
And that guy?

432
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:33,414
That's Nacho. He's a photographer.

433
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:38,331
I don't really like him
and his pictures are kind of boring.

434
00:39:38,498 --> 00:39:41,373
That's Ernesto, I don't know
what he does for a living.

435
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:44,289
He doesn't really get involved,
but he's a good guy.

436
00:39:45,456 --> 00:39:49,248
And the guy over there is Santiago,
he's cool.

437
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:03,164
- Right...
- I can read "San José".

438
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:04,914
Go on.

439
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:08,123
San José was nothing more
than mere lights in the distance

440
00:40:08,623 --> 00:40:10,581
An administrative constellation

441
00:40:10,748 --> 00:40:13,414
Which, at night,
conceals its underdeveloped state

442
00:40:13,581 --> 00:40:14,598
The rest:

443
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:17,998
Empty beer cans,
disregarded for being lukewarm

444
00:40:18,164 --> 00:40:21,831
A flickering light from a car
with its doors flung open

445
00:40:21,998 --> 00:40:25,789
And the devalued feeling
that we call affection.

446
00:40:52,914 --> 00:40:54,748
Why aren't you dancing?

447
00:40:55,414 --> 00:40:59,331
I know the basics, but I can't really dance.

448
00:41:46,831 --> 00:41:47,914
You good?

449
00:41:49,164 --> 00:41:50,664
Yeah, fine.

450
00:41:53,664 --> 00:41:54,998
Are you done dancing?

451
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:01,664
Does your mum know you're staying over?

452
00:42:01,689 --> 00:42:02,691
No.

453
00:42:03,873 --> 00:42:06,206
She's gonna call me,
I'm not ready for it. Fuck!

454
00:42:06,373 --> 00:42:09,331
Calm down, I'll explain it to her tomorrow.

455
00:42:09,498 --> 00:42:10,578
Come here.

456
00:42:18,748 --> 00:42:22,164
- You're all I have left, you know?
- What's up?

457
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:28,581
- Does that hurt?
- Yes, Dad, it hurts.

458
00:42:28,748 --> 00:42:30,956
Are you sure? Focus.

459
00:42:34,414 --> 00:42:35,873
OK, it doesn't hurt so bad.

460
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:37,089
See?

461
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:39,456
We're scared of pain,

462
00:42:40,206 --> 00:42:43,081
but when we face it,
we realise that it's nothing.

463
00:42:43,956 --> 00:42:46,873
It's not a big deal.

464
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:49,873
You shouldn't be scared of pain.

465
00:42:50,789 --> 00:42:53,331
You always say the same thing,
I'm going to bed.

466
00:42:53,498 --> 00:42:55,873
No, don't go, don't leave me alone.

467
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:57,498
Is this another of your...

468
00:42:57,664 --> 00:42:59,914
What do you think of the girl
I was dancing with?

469
00:43:00,081 --> 00:43:01,748
Pretty, right?

470
00:43:01,914 --> 00:43:03,164
Up to you.

471
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,331
And the poem?

472
00:43:05,831 --> 00:43:07,373
Was the reading OK?

473
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:09,164
People liked it, right?

474
00:43:09,189 --> 00:43:10,247
Yes.

475
00:43:10,414 --> 00:43:13,498
Your mum didn't like me writing.

476
00:43:13,664 --> 00:43:17,748
As much as she likes to make out
that I'm the arsehole...

477
00:43:17,914 --> 00:43:19,456
Dad, let me through, please.

478
00:43:19,623 --> 00:43:21,914
...I wasn't, we were both to blame.

479
00:43:22,081 --> 00:43:23,373
Let me through.

480
00:43:24,418 --> 00:43:25,497
Stop.

481
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,164
Sorry, I don't want her seeing me like this.

482
00:43:44,414 --> 00:43:47,623
I don't know what you see in her,
she seems like, as you say...

483
00:43:48,706 --> 00:43:50,456
- "Kind of loose".
- Shut it!

484
00:43:51,248 --> 00:43:52,831
And she wears too much makeup.

485
00:43:58,623 --> 00:43:59,664
Occupied!

486
00:44:03,206 --> 00:44:04,248
Hi.

487
00:44:04,748 --> 00:44:06,831
Have you seen how many people came?

488
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:10,081
Everything OK?

489
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:13,164
To be honest, I'm kinda shattered.

490
00:44:13,331 --> 00:44:14,956
No way.

491
00:44:16,373 --> 00:44:19,373
- I haven't seen you like this in ages.
- Since when?

492
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:21,914
I think it was at Pepe's, remember?

493
00:44:22,081 --> 00:44:23,581
I remember, mate.

494
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:28,206
Sorry, I need the toilet.

495
00:44:28,873 --> 00:44:30,956
Go for it.

496
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:37,123
Fuck.

497
00:44:37,289 --> 00:44:38,498
Occupied.

498
00:44:44,206 --> 00:44:46,498
My dad died of cancer, did you know that?

499
00:44:46,664 --> 00:44:48,664
We're all going to die someday.

500
00:44:51,873 --> 00:44:53,581
No shit, man!

501
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:58,956
I'm already dead.

502
00:45:00,956 --> 00:45:03,664
Listen to this, it's a great song.

503
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:13,289
Dad, no, leave me alone.

504
00:45:15,748 --> 00:45:18,498
Again, now what?

505
00:45:18,664 --> 00:45:21,373
If we don't cut the music,
the neighbour will call the police.

506
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:23,664
- Fucking police.
- I'm coming.

507
00:45:32,081 --> 00:45:33,831
Hi, all good?

508
00:45:33,998 --> 00:45:35,289
Occupied.

509
00:46:19,373 --> 00:46:21,456
- Hey.
- What's up?

510
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:24,748
Have you seen my dad?

511
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:26,309
No.

512
00:46:40,414 --> 00:46:41,539
Are you OK?

513
00:46:43,956 --> 00:46:45,623
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

514
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:49,289
You drank too much.

515
00:47:07,914 --> 00:47:09,789
I feel like I'm gonna die.

516
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,581
I smoked your cigarette.

517
00:47:17,206 --> 00:47:19,914
- Which one?
- The one that was in the bathroom.

518
00:47:24,081 --> 00:47:25,789
- What are you doing?
- Let's see.

519
00:47:25,956 --> 00:47:27,498
Don't overreact.

520
00:47:27,664 --> 00:47:28,873
Let me see.

521
00:47:37,581 --> 00:47:41,081
What's wrong with you?
That's disgusting.

522
00:47:41,248 --> 00:47:43,289
You shouldn't smoke that stuff.

523
00:47:44,498 --> 00:47:45,539
Why not?

524
00:47:45,706 --> 00:47:47,581
You're still growing.

525
00:47:47,748 --> 00:47:48,806
So?

526
00:47:48,831 --> 00:47:49,873
I don't know.

527
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:52,414
It might make you want to fly like a bird.

528
00:48:25,831 --> 00:48:27,123
Are you OK?

529
00:48:28,581 --> 00:48:29,581
Yes.

530
00:48:45,498 --> 00:48:46,664
And you?

531
00:48:49,053 --> 00:48:50,101
Yes.

532
00:49:34,706 --> 00:49:36,164
Give me a minute.

533
00:49:41,289 --> 00:49:42,373
Not in the mood?

534
00:49:46,998 --> 00:49:48,206
It's not that.

535
00:49:50,456 --> 00:49:52,706
I don't like being told what to do.

536
00:49:55,664 --> 00:49:57,164
I didn't say anything.

537
00:50:05,998 --> 00:50:07,331
What shall we do?

538
00:50:09,081 --> 00:50:10,498
Have you done it before?

539
00:50:11,123 --> 00:50:12,143
No.

540
00:50:17,956 --> 00:50:18,998
Well...

541
00:50:19,164 --> 00:50:21,331
When you want something,
you know what to do.

542
00:50:23,206 --> 00:50:24,581
I'm not stupid.

543
00:54:21,789 --> 00:54:23,748
I didn't know you were sleeping.

544
00:54:26,414 --> 00:54:28,206
Why are you still in bed?

545
00:54:32,248 --> 00:54:33,748
Did you go out?

546
00:54:33,914 --> 00:54:35,123
Yeah.

547
00:54:37,581 --> 00:54:39,331
Why's your makeup still on?

548
00:54:40,789 --> 00:54:42,581
Cos I was tired when I got home.

549
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:45,581
Who did you go out with?

550
00:54:48,498 --> 00:54:49,998
What are you, the police?

551
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:52,789
Have you got a temperature?

552
00:54:55,581 --> 00:54:57,289
Did you sleep well?

553
00:55:02,664 --> 00:55:04,331
Did you have a nightmare?

554
00:55:07,581 --> 00:55:08,914
Yes.

555
00:55:09,789 --> 00:55:11,414
I did have a nightmare.

556
00:55:14,706 --> 00:55:16,331
I dreamt that...

557
00:55:17,664 --> 00:55:19,539
the house was on fire.

558
00:55:21,414 --> 00:55:24,498
And that you were inside, in the kitchen.

559
00:55:29,748 --> 00:55:31,498
And your hair was on fire.

560
00:55:54,373 --> 00:55:56,498
On the radio there's a little chick

561
00:55:59,081 --> 00:56:01,373
On the radio there's a little chick

562
00:56:03,081 --> 00:56:05,289
And the chick cheeps...

563
00:56:25,831 --> 00:56:28,248
You like it? How does it look?

564
00:56:31,289 --> 00:56:32,289
Yeah.

565
00:56:37,164 --> 00:56:38,998
What about you, do you like it?

566
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:45,373
Go on, go have a bath.

567
00:56:47,414 --> 00:56:49,456
- Kwesi.
- Mum, how does this work?

568
00:56:49,623 --> 00:56:51,956
- Go take a bath.
- Kwesi, come here!

569
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:55,581
- Hi.
- Come, sweetie.

570
00:56:55,748 --> 00:56:57,623
Sol, stop bugging him!

571
00:56:57,789 --> 00:56:58,873
I don't want to.

572
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:00,456
Get out from under there.

573
00:57:00,623 --> 00:57:01,664
No.

574
00:57:01,831 --> 00:57:03,498
Sol, don't be stubborn.

575
00:57:04,581 --> 00:57:06,748
Sol, leave him alone.

576
00:57:06,914 --> 00:57:09,164
- Don't be stubborn.
- Ow, Kwesi!

577
00:57:09,331 --> 00:57:11,873
Mum, Kwesi scratched me!

578
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:14,664
- What's wrong?
- I told her not to bug him!

579
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:16,206
What did he do to you?

580
00:57:16,748 --> 00:57:19,539
I wanted to stroke him and he attacked me.

581
00:57:19,706 --> 00:57:20,956
This cat is crazy.

582
00:57:23,456 --> 00:57:24,789
That cat has got to go!

583
00:57:43,373 --> 00:57:45,414
Where are you taking us, Dad?

584
00:57:45,581 --> 00:57:48,206
It's a surprise, you'll see.

585
00:57:52,831 --> 00:57:53,891
And you?

586
00:57:54,831 --> 00:57:56,289
How come you're so calm?

587
00:57:58,164 --> 00:57:59,206
Just because.

588
00:58:14,914 --> 00:58:17,123
Right, who's going first?

589
00:58:17,289 --> 00:58:19,914
Dad, are you sure
this is the right entrance?

590
00:58:20,081 --> 00:58:21,748
Yes, it's the right entrance.

591
00:58:23,456 --> 00:58:26,373
It doesn't look like it, we're trespassing.

592
00:58:26,539 --> 00:58:28,998
No one will know, come on, let's go!

593
00:58:30,914 --> 00:58:31,956
Go down!

594
00:58:32,748 --> 00:58:34,664
A bit lower.

595
00:58:35,164 --> 00:58:37,789
- Hold the wire down.
- Careful.

596
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:39,539
A little more...

597
00:58:39,706 --> 00:58:42,748
My jumper, my jumper...

598
00:58:45,081 --> 00:58:46,581
Fuck's sake.

599
00:58:50,456 --> 00:58:52,789
Go on, eat that.

600
00:58:56,123 --> 00:58:57,414
Leave it, Dad!

601
00:58:57,581 --> 00:58:58,914
Fine.

602
00:59:00,456 --> 00:59:01,539
So?

603
00:59:01,706 --> 00:59:03,831
- It's nice.
- Nice, huh?

604
00:59:05,456 --> 00:59:06,581
Let's go.

605
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:18,831
Look, it's on the hunt.

606
00:59:19,539 --> 00:59:21,081
- Did you see that?
- No.

607
00:59:21,248 --> 00:59:22,956
When it dove down.

608
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:26,414
One day, with my brothers,

609
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:29,248
we buried some knives around here.

610
00:59:29,414 --> 00:59:32,164
It was under the big tree over there,
I think.

611
00:59:32,331 --> 00:59:34,289
Or in those ones over there.

612
00:59:35,206 --> 00:59:37,539
Dad, Eva's smoking.

613
00:59:39,123 --> 00:59:40,164
It's OK.

614
00:59:42,831 --> 00:59:44,581
We came here for some fresh air.

615
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,414
Come, sit down.

616
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:48,164
Let's breathe.

617
00:59:50,831 --> 00:59:52,956
All three of us.

618
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:56,581
Take a deep breath.
One, two, three.

619
00:59:58,706 --> 01:00:00,081
Hold it.

620
01:00:05,539 --> 01:00:06,706
And again.

621
01:00:14,623 --> 01:00:17,789
OK, let's move around a bit.
Up you get.

622
01:00:17,956 --> 01:00:21,664
- Helicopter!
- Put me down!

623
01:00:28,414 --> 01:00:30,998
I went to your place yesterday,
they gave me food

624
01:00:31,164 --> 01:00:33,498
Rice, beans, raw tortillas

625
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:36,414
Yesterday, I was at a ball
and an old man kissed me

626
01:00:36,581 --> 01:00:39,206
I called him an idiot, my sister got angry

627
01:00:39,373 --> 01:00:41,956
My sister had a baby, the nutjob killed it

628
01:00:42,123 --> 01:00:44,998
And the one who moves ate it.

629
01:00:55,581 --> 01:00:57,289
Dad, where are we going now?

630
01:00:57,456 --> 01:00:59,998
Since we're in the area,
we're gonna visit someone.

631
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:02,081
Visit?

632
01:01:02,914 --> 01:01:04,081
Who?

633
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:11,164
What's this arsehole's problem?
Go on, go.

634
01:01:11,914 --> 01:01:12,956
Wanker!

635
01:01:14,123 --> 01:01:16,414
That dickhead, I'll show him.

636
01:01:16,581 --> 01:01:20,414
- Pull your window down!
- Dad, no!

637
01:01:20,581 --> 01:01:23,914
- Pull your fucking window down!
- This is ridiculous.

638
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:25,373
Pull it down!

639
01:01:30,998 --> 01:01:32,789
Go get therapy, you wanker!

640
01:01:34,706 --> 01:01:35,998
Fuck!

641
01:01:38,123 --> 01:01:39,248
Fuck!

642
01:01:43,706 --> 01:01:45,581
Dad, I nearly went flying.

643
01:01:48,206 --> 01:01:49,831
I'm in the death seat.

644
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:52,664
- The death seat?
- Yeah, the seat in front.

645
01:01:52,831 --> 01:01:55,581
So, go to the back, then, like a little kid.

646
01:02:26,373 --> 01:02:27,706
Hold on tighter.

647
01:02:27,873 --> 01:02:28,873
Hi.

648
01:02:29,956 --> 01:02:32,706
- Hi.
- The girls and I were in the area.

649
01:02:32,873 --> 01:02:36,248
So, I thought I'd swing round and say hi.

650
01:02:36,414 --> 01:02:39,373
I almost didn't find the house,
but I ended up...

651
01:02:39,902 --> 01:02:40,915
Hello.

652
01:02:42,623 --> 01:02:43,623
Hi.

653
01:02:48,237 --> 01:02:49,251
Here!

654
01:02:50,206 --> 01:02:51,456
Thank you.

655
01:02:51,956 --> 01:02:54,956
So, you're a translator, Martín.

656
01:02:55,498 --> 01:02:58,164
Yes, I'm a translator.

657
01:02:58,331 --> 01:02:59,789
What do you translate?

658
01:03:00,289 --> 01:03:04,331
Birth, death certificates,
that kind of thing.

659
01:03:05,456 --> 01:03:07,956
But he's also a painter and a sculptor.

660
01:03:08,123 --> 01:03:09,748
You're a sculptor too?

661
01:03:09,914 --> 01:03:11,456
I'm getting back into it.

662
01:03:11,623 --> 01:03:15,581
- Better?
- No, it's still wet.

663
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:19,706
Sandra told me

664
01:03:19,873 --> 01:03:22,623
that you met at the poetry workshop,
is that right?

665
01:03:27,081 --> 01:03:30,123
- Yes, that's it.
- I love poetry.

666
01:03:30,914 --> 01:03:33,081
I love de Bravo, Neruda...

667
01:03:34,373 --> 01:03:35,623
Interesting.

668
01:03:35,789 --> 01:03:38,914
That's old-school. We don't read that
in workshops anymore.

669
01:03:39,914 --> 01:03:42,623
Of course, I don't really know.

670
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:49,123
I'd love to have the chance
to read some new stuff.

671
01:03:49,289 --> 01:03:51,914
Maybe some of your poems?
You write, don't you?

672
01:03:52,081 --> 01:03:56,331
To be honest, they're all just drafts,

673
01:03:56,498 --> 01:03:59,623
notes, nothing that's really finished.

674
01:03:59,789 --> 01:04:01,664
That's OK.

675
01:04:01,831 --> 01:04:03,706
Come on, he should read something.

676
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:06,831
Nobody reads unfinished work.

677
01:04:06,998 --> 01:04:09,956
I'm not expecting a work of art,
but read something.

678
01:04:11,319 --> 01:04:12,345
Read.

679
01:04:18,164 --> 01:04:20,998
I don't understand
why you prefer me when I'm drunk

680
01:04:22,581 --> 01:04:27,914
As if I were a trapped genie
that you freed from the bottle

681
01:04:28,081 --> 01:04:30,331
You didn't see the garden
that was going to be ours

682
01:04:32,414 --> 01:04:35,289
Sometimes, I remember
how perfect those paths were

683
01:04:35,456 --> 01:04:39,164
Where each tree was, its size

684
01:04:40,831 --> 01:04:41,956
Your light.

685
01:05:20,414 --> 01:05:22,873
- Hi, how did it go?
- Good.

686
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:24,789
I was starting to worry.

687
01:05:24,956 --> 01:05:27,581
- Wait.
- No, she's sleeping.

688
01:05:27,748 --> 01:05:29,956
Poor thing, did you guys eat?

689
01:05:30,123 --> 01:05:32,456
Yes, we ate.
I'm going to put her to bed.

690
01:05:42,248 --> 01:05:43,274
Hey...

691
01:05:44,414 --> 01:05:45,789
Promise me something.

692
01:05:47,914 --> 01:05:49,956
Don't tell Mum what happened.

693
01:05:52,623 --> 01:05:53,873
What happened?

694
01:05:56,373 --> 01:05:57,419
Nothing.

695
01:06:20,914 --> 01:06:22,039
What's wrong?

696
01:06:30,873 --> 01:06:33,581
The house felt so empty today.

697
01:06:46,748 --> 01:06:48,081
I was flying,

698
01:06:48,248 --> 01:06:51,414
a giant hand was pulling me down

699
01:06:51,581 --> 01:06:53,539
and I was really scared.

700
01:06:53,706 --> 01:06:54,914
Why?

701
01:06:56,331 --> 01:06:59,581
I don't know, it felt
like there was magma underneath me,

702
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:02,206
but covered in scales.

703
01:07:03,748 --> 01:07:06,414
That's beautiful, I'll use it in a poem.

704
01:07:07,706 --> 01:07:09,039
Why?

705
01:07:09,206 --> 01:07:13,123
The imagery of magma's interesting
because it's threatening

706
01:07:13,289 --> 01:07:15,123
and soft at the same time.

707
01:07:15,289 --> 01:07:17,539
I don't think I like the word "magma".

708
01:07:18,456 --> 01:07:19,581
True.

709
01:07:20,206 --> 01:07:22,164
The effect is a little obvious.

710
01:07:30,289 --> 01:07:33,956
Mum says that dreams where you fly
are linked to sexuality.

711
01:07:36,581 --> 01:07:38,748
Don't listen to her, that's bullshit.

712
01:07:41,581 --> 01:07:42,748
Dad...

713
01:07:43,956 --> 01:07:44,998
What?

714
01:07:55,331 --> 01:07:56,748
I think it's over there.

715
01:08:01,248 --> 01:08:04,081
In addition to that,
bill management, recycling, compost,

716
01:08:04,248 --> 01:08:05,664
and maintenance.

717
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:09,331
If the bulb blows,
if something needs to be replaced,

718
01:08:09,498 --> 01:08:13,123
that kind of stuff, someone will come
and fix it in under 10 minutes.

719
01:08:13,831 --> 01:08:15,456
And then, of course,

720
01:08:16,081 --> 01:08:19,414
there's the view from this apartment,
my favourite thing.

721
01:08:20,581 --> 01:08:22,164
Yeah, it's nice.

722
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:49,414
I WOULD OFFER YOU THE SUN, YELINA

723
01:08:56,998 --> 01:08:59,289
That place was a chicken coop.

724
01:08:59,456 --> 01:09:02,039
It was tiny.

725
01:09:02,206 --> 01:09:03,873
Who would live there?

726
01:09:04,623 --> 01:09:06,831
It was good, it had two bedrooms.

727
01:09:07,414 --> 01:09:10,664
You call those bedrooms?

728
01:09:10,831 --> 01:09:12,331
And it was so expensive.

729
01:09:12,498 --> 01:09:15,706
It was big.
The kitchen, the living room...

730
01:09:15,873 --> 01:09:19,164
And that's why you have to pay
200 dollars for maintenance?

731
01:09:19,331 --> 01:09:20,331
Never.

732
01:09:21,331 --> 01:09:22,331
Never.

733
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:26,581
I liked it.

734
01:09:29,164 --> 01:09:31,206
The girl was pretty.

735
01:09:32,581 --> 01:09:34,414
I should've asked for her number.

736
01:09:35,623 --> 01:09:37,956
You think a woman like that
would be into you?

737
01:09:42,789 --> 01:09:43,809
Sorry.

738
01:09:46,289 --> 01:09:47,539
Forgive me.

739
01:09:53,831 --> 01:09:55,789
You said you'd stop doing that.

740
01:09:58,456 --> 01:09:59,914
Why? Did it hurt?

741
01:10:06,654 --> 01:10:07,694
Eva.

742
01:10:16,456 --> 01:10:19,623
This lift keeps breaking down.

743
01:10:19,789 --> 01:10:21,206
It must be damaged.

744
01:10:25,077 --> 01:10:26,097
Are you OK?

745
01:10:33,331 --> 01:10:35,164
Is there a problem, young lady?

746
01:10:38,664 --> 01:10:41,789
What?
Why are you looking at me like that?

747
01:10:42,456 --> 01:10:47,498
We've got CCTV here,
do we need to watch the footage?

748
01:10:48,414 --> 01:10:49,748
You looking for a war?

749
01:10:50,331 --> 01:10:51,581
Are you?

750
01:11:06,998 --> 01:11:08,414
Did Kwesi eat?

751
01:11:09,123 --> 01:11:10,748
Is there any food?

752
01:11:10,914 --> 01:11:12,498
I don't know, I'm gonna check.

753
01:11:13,289 --> 01:11:16,914
- He gets anxious when he doesn't eat.
- Yeah, I know.

754
01:11:20,581 --> 01:11:21,873
Hey, buddy.

755
01:11:22,956 --> 01:11:25,664
- Hey.
- I'm gonna cook us something nice.

756
01:11:27,248 --> 01:11:30,039
- You joining us?
- No, I had a late lunch.

757
01:11:30,206 --> 01:11:31,248
OK.

758
01:11:31,414 --> 01:11:34,039
I'm going to go buy some cat food, coming?

759
01:11:37,998 --> 01:11:39,706
No, I'll stay here with Kwesi.

760
01:11:44,164 --> 01:11:45,206
I'll be back.

761
01:11:50,248 --> 01:11:52,289
- What's his name?
- Linton Kwesi.

762
01:11:52,998 --> 01:11:54,081
What?

763
01:11:54,248 --> 01:11:57,164
Linton Kwesi Johnson, it's a Jamaican poet.

764
01:12:01,289 --> 01:12:03,206
Kwesi, Kwesi...

765
01:12:03,373 --> 01:12:05,331
He likes to be stroked gently.

766
01:12:24,248 --> 01:12:25,289
Sorry.

767
01:12:25,456 --> 01:12:27,498
I think I'm allergic to cats.

768
01:12:39,331 --> 01:12:42,373
Kwesi, go on.

769
01:12:42,873 --> 01:12:43,956
Get out!

770
01:13:01,956 --> 01:13:03,373
This isn't a good idea.

771
01:13:03,539 --> 01:13:04,956
What?

772
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:06,664
This.

773
01:13:07,373 --> 01:13:08,373
This what?

774
01:13:28,664 --> 01:13:31,623
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

775
01:13:32,414 --> 01:13:33,581
Don't worry.

776
01:13:41,456 --> 01:13:42,789
Aren't you in love?

777
01:13:47,164 --> 01:13:49,414
I don't know.
I wouldn't use that word.

778
01:14:02,998 --> 01:14:04,914
What word would you use, then?

779
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:22,498
Why are you laughing?

780
01:14:23,956 --> 01:14:25,873
I don't know. It's not that simple.

781
01:14:29,873 --> 01:14:31,748
Don't cry.

782
01:14:32,539 --> 01:14:34,039
Don't take it that way.

783
01:14:34,206 --> 01:14:35,664
Then, how should I take it?

784
01:15:15,248 --> 01:15:16,248
Sorry.

785
01:15:43,373 --> 01:15:44,581
Where were you?

786
01:15:48,081 --> 01:15:49,706
I got the cat food.

787
01:15:51,998 --> 01:15:53,024
Eva.

788
01:15:54,204 --> 01:15:55,230
Are you OK?

789
01:15:55,414 --> 01:15:56,789
Is something wrong?

790
01:15:57,456 --> 01:15:58,539
No, nothing.

791
01:16:40,248 --> 01:16:41,456
Are you OK, Dad?

792
01:16:43,331 --> 01:16:45,873
What's wrong? Do you need...

793
01:16:50,248 --> 01:16:51,706
Mate, what happened?

794
01:16:53,998 --> 01:16:55,456
Did you cut yourself?

795
01:16:57,498 --> 01:17:00,373
Paper and a towel.
Put your hand under the water.

796
01:17:05,873 --> 01:17:07,164
It's going to be fine.

797
01:17:25,623 --> 01:17:27,914
Come on. I have to do three stitches.

798
01:17:30,664 --> 01:17:33,164
Don't move. Lie down, please.

799
01:17:40,581 --> 01:17:42,331
How old are you?

800
01:17:43,539 --> 01:17:44,873
You look young.

801
01:17:45,831 --> 01:17:48,123
As young as my daughter.

802
01:17:49,539 --> 01:17:52,123
OK, maybe not as young.

803
01:17:54,539 --> 01:17:57,456
Can I ask you something?
I have a mark on my tongue.

804
01:17:58,456 --> 01:18:01,539
- Do you think it's cancer?
- You should consult a specialist.

805
01:18:01,706 --> 01:18:05,081
- Lie down, please.
- Look.

806
01:18:07,706 --> 01:18:10,873
It looks like a mouth ulcer.
Lie down, please.

807
01:18:13,081 --> 01:18:15,748
All done, a nurse will come in
and clean you up.

808
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:18,414
A mouth ulcer...

809
01:18:40,623 --> 01:18:42,331
You got a problem?

810
01:18:42,498 --> 01:18:44,248
You got a problem, dickhead?

811
01:18:44,414 --> 01:18:46,123
What? What did you say?

812
01:18:46,289 --> 01:18:48,039
Dad, calm down.

813
01:18:48,206 --> 01:18:51,539
- Fuck off.
- Dad, let's go.

814
01:18:53,206 --> 01:18:55,414
Don't do that, you'll just make it worse.

815
01:18:59,748 --> 01:19:01,164
What an arsehole.

816
01:19:01,664 --> 01:19:02,664
Let's go.

817
01:19:10,789 --> 01:19:12,039
You're right.

818
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:14,956
I can't do anything

819
01:19:15,581 --> 01:19:17,914
to stop those things from happening.

820
01:19:22,873 --> 01:19:27,248
You're old enough now to defend yourself.

821
01:19:34,081 --> 01:19:35,998
Could you button up your shirt?

822
01:19:36,998 --> 01:19:38,914
Why didn't you say anything before?

823
01:20:08,081 --> 01:20:09,623
Please don't do that.

824
01:20:15,664 --> 01:20:18,164
You should stay at your mum's
the next few days.

825
01:20:19,248 --> 01:20:21,623
I've got some stuff to sort out.

826
01:20:39,873 --> 01:20:41,789
How much for a song?

827
01:20:41,956 --> 01:20:43,956
- Ten.
- Ten?

828
01:20:44,123 --> 01:20:45,873
I've only got two.

829
01:21:43,914 --> 01:21:47,581
No, keep going.
Don't pay any attention to them.

830
01:21:47,887 --> 01:21:48,914
Manuel.

831
01:22:56,331 --> 01:22:58,706
Mum, what are we going to do
with these pictures?

832
01:22:58,873 --> 01:23:00,539
I don't know yet.

833
01:23:01,164 --> 01:23:03,789
You didn't like that aunt,
why are you framing her?

834
01:23:04,873 --> 01:23:07,414
- Why?
- We owe her a lot, Eva.

835
01:23:08,873 --> 01:23:10,414
Yes, bless her heart.

836
01:23:10,581 --> 01:23:14,623
Yes, bless her heart.
She was self-made.

837
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:16,039
Bless her cash.

838
01:23:19,123 --> 01:23:20,456
Are you not feeling OK?

839
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:24,914
You don't look so good.

840
01:23:30,498 --> 01:23:31,539
I'm fine.

841
01:23:31,998 --> 01:23:33,664
What are they doing?

842
01:23:34,248 --> 01:23:35,664
Fucking.

843
01:23:36,145 --> 01:23:37,151
Eva.

844
01:23:38,331 --> 01:23:41,248
Switch it off now!

845
01:23:42,581 --> 01:23:45,289
- We had a deal.
- Mum, I didn't do anything.

846
01:23:45,456 --> 01:23:47,914
No violence in this house, even on the TV.

847
01:23:48,789 --> 01:23:51,581
You didn't tell me what colour
you wanted your room.

848
01:23:53,873 --> 01:23:55,164
Pick a colour.

849
01:23:56,289 --> 01:23:57,748
I don't know, you choose.

850
01:23:57,914 --> 01:23:59,456
It's up to you.

851
01:24:00,123 --> 01:24:02,914
Just tell me something, give me a colour.

852
01:24:03,081 --> 01:24:06,498
Yellow, white, cream, pink.
What do you want?

853
01:24:06,664 --> 01:24:08,206
I don't know.

854
01:24:13,956 --> 01:24:16,581
- Mum!
- Mum, are you OK?

855
01:24:22,956 --> 01:24:24,206
What an idiot.

856
01:24:28,123 --> 01:24:29,248
What an idiot.

857
01:24:30,164 --> 01:24:31,789
That's going to hurt now.

858
01:24:34,873 --> 01:24:36,414
Electric blue.

859
01:24:37,539 --> 01:24:38,789
Electric blue,

860
01:24:40,914 --> 01:24:42,123
for your room.

861
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:50,039
I think I'm gonna go live with Dad.

862
01:24:57,248 --> 01:24:59,164
What am I going to do with this house?

863
01:25:01,331 --> 01:25:02,373
I don't know.

864
01:25:02,539 --> 01:25:03,664
Should I sell it?

865
01:25:05,748 --> 01:25:07,081
Do what you want.

866
01:25:07,248 --> 01:25:09,081
What I want!

867
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:10,348
OK.

868
01:25:10,373 --> 01:25:13,623
I'm going to burn it down.

869
01:25:13,789 --> 01:25:15,581
- No, Mum.
- No, I'll burn it down.

870
01:25:15,748 --> 01:25:20,289
I'm going to light it on fucking fire
and burn it down.

871
01:25:20,456 --> 01:25:22,706
- No, don't burn it down.
- I'm going to.

872
01:25:22,873 --> 01:25:24,456
Don't, where would we live?

873
01:25:24,623 --> 01:25:27,123
I'll do what I want
so I'm gonna set it alight.

874
01:25:29,293 --> 01:25:31,348
This obsession you have with your dad

875
01:25:31,373 --> 01:25:33,414
and all the men that will come your way,

876
01:25:33,581 --> 01:25:36,081
is something that'll pass, mark my words!

877
01:26:53,373 --> 01:26:54,789
Are you OK?

878
01:26:57,271 --> 01:26:58,732
I'm sorry.

879
01:27:01,047 --> 01:27:03,281
I drink too much.

880
01:27:04,576 --> 01:27:08,146
- I'm gonna bring you some water, OK?
- No, don't go.

881
01:27:09,383 --> 01:27:12,172
Could you stay a moment with me?

882
01:27:13,497 --> 01:27:15,240
I like crying sometimes.

883
01:27:17,651 --> 01:27:20,542
It makes me feel
closer to my heart or something.

884
01:27:26,766 --> 01:27:28,758
This is my father's room.

885
01:27:29,682 --> 01:27:32,714
Oh. Yeah?

886
01:27:34,211 --> 01:27:36,852
Just came here because
it was so empty, so...

887
01:27:39,055 --> 01:27:40,602
You calling him?

888
01:27:42,208 --> 01:27:44,404
- Yes, I don't know where he is.
- Oh.

889
01:27:49,695 --> 01:27:51,531
Do you want me to leave?

890
01:27:55,091 --> 01:27:56,169
No, that's OK.

891
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:03,810
How old are you?

892
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:05,583
16.

893
01:28:07,068 --> 01:28:09,208
16, wow.

894
01:28:09,656 --> 01:28:11,734
When I was 16, I was...

895
01:28:12,531 --> 01:28:14,070
I was crazy.

896
01:28:15,966 --> 01:28:18,122
Wow, you're so young.

897
01:28:20,557 --> 01:28:23,471
I like being with you now.
Thank you.

898
01:28:26,651 --> 01:28:28,948
It's like we are sisters, now.

899
01:28:32,023 --> 01:28:34,219
All women are sisters, you know?

900
01:28:34,484 --> 01:28:36,969
I think we have to unite, and...

901
01:28:37,206 --> 01:28:40,151
be strong together, you know?

902
01:29:13,539 --> 01:29:14,565
Eva...

903
01:29:19,039 --> 01:29:20,248
Are you OK?

904
01:29:21,873 --> 01:29:22,893
Yes.

905
01:29:24,956 --> 01:29:28,581
I'm heading out,
should I drop you off at your mum's?

906
01:29:29,998 --> 01:29:31,498
No, thanks.

907
01:29:31,664 --> 01:29:32,664
Are you sure?

908
01:29:33,539 --> 01:29:35,623
Yeah, I'll wait for my dad.

909
01:29:35,789 --> 01:29:36,795
OK.

910
01:31:26,331 --> 01:31:28,623
Why didn't you tell me
you'd picked this place?

911
01:31:32,664 --> 01:31:36,081
I looked in the papers
and it was the cheapest I could find.

912
01:31:36,248 --> 01:31:38,039
I had to make a decision quickly.

913
01:31:38,206 --> 01:31:39,748
You want something to drink?

914
01:31:40,414 --> 01:31:41,873
There's only one bedroom.

915
01:31:48,456 --> 01:31:51,123
- Say something!
- Say what?

916
01:31:51,789 --> 01:31:55,498
- There's only one bedroom!
- Yes, one fucking bedroom, and what?

917
01:31:56,664 --> 01:31:58,206
What do you want me to do?

918
01:32:04,373 --> 01:32:05,414
And Kwesi?

919
01:32:06,123 --> 01:32:07,539
Kwesi...

920
01:32:10,206 --> 01:32:13,248
Pets aren't allowed here,
I had to take him to a refuge.

921
01:32:13,873 --> 01:32:16,664
They'll take care of him there and feed him.

922
01:32:16,831 --> 01:32:18,164
It's all good.

923
01:32:23,956 --> 01:32:25,664
You want war?

924
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:37,206
You bastard, I'm gonna kill you.

925
01:32:39,206 --> 01:32:40,789
Dickhead!

926
01:33:58,289 --> 01:33:59,456
Hello?

927
01:34:00,248 --> 01:34:01,456
Yes.

928
01:34:02,581 --> 01:34:04,206
Eva Quesada Marín.

929
01:34:06,998 --> 01:34:09,289
8-3-2-4-9-8-9-8.

930
01:34:10,831 --> 01:34:13,998
San Francisco, San José.

931
01:34:15,664 --> 01:34:17,248
I don't know.

932
01:34:17,847 --> 01:34:18,874
I think...

933
01:34:20,456 --> 01:34:24,248
From the "La Marina" shop,
it's 300 meters east.

934
01:34:24,414 --> 01:34:26,998
The three-storey, blue building.

935
01:34:32,539 --> 01:34:34,289
My dad tried to strangle me.

936
01:36:03,998 --> 01:36:05,164
Hello.

937
01:36:05,331 --> 01:36:07,498
We got a domestic violence call.

938
01:36:07,664 --> 01:36:09,706
Were you the one who called?

939
01:36:09,826 --> 01:36:10,848
Yes.

940
01:36:10,873 --> 01:36:12,831
- It was you?
- Yes.

941
01:36:12,998 --> 01:36:17,289
Are you injured?

942
01:36:17,456 --> 01:36:20,331
Are you OK?
Do you need any medical assistance?

943
01:36:20,498 --> 01:36:21,789
No.

944
01:36:21,956 --> 01:36:23,581
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

945
01:36:24,706 --> 01:36:26,706
Is that the man who attacked you?

946
01:36:29,414 --> 01:36:31,539
- Yes, it's me.
- Stay over here.

947
01:36:34,039 --> 01:36:37,706
If you want, you can wait in the car
if you'll feel more comfortable.

948
01:36:37,873 --> 01:36:38,879
Come.

949
01:36:42,498 --> 01:36:46,414
Is this man a relative?

950
01:36:46,581 --> 01:36:47,748
Yes, he's my dad.

951
01:36:47,914 --> 01:36:49,998
Do you live with your dad?

952
01:36:50,539 --> 01:36:53,581
- No, I live with my mum.
- With your mum.

953
01:36:53,748 --> 01:36:57,664
We're going to the police station
to file your report.

954
01:36:57,831 --> 01:37:00,039
Then we'll call social services.

955
01:37:00,206 --> 01:37:01,581
Do I need to file a report?

956
01:37:01,748 --> 01:37:05,248
Yes, you should because we received
the call from you.

957
01:37:09,664 --> 01:37:13,331
At a Mexican restaurant called Mero.

958
01:37:14,748 --> 01:37:18,914
Have you never been?
It's delicious, you'll see.

959
01:37:19,081 --> 01:37:21,456
- I've never been.
- This place is...

960
01:37:23,039 --> 01:37:25,414
close to Gabi's beauty salon, right?

961
01:37:38,456 --> 01:37:42,289
And when I got out of the car,
I heard a loud bang

962
01:37:43,289 --> 01:37:47,539
and the patrol car reversed without looking.

963
01:37:48,373 --> 01:37:49,623
Yelina!

964
01:37:50,956 --> 01:37:51,998
Yelina!

965
01:37:52,873 --> 01:37:55,664
I wasn't expecting it,
I asked him if he was going to look.

966
01:37:55,831 --> 01:37:57,039
Yelina!

967
01:37:57,748 --> 01:38:00,873
We're gonna go get a coffee over there.

968
01:38:03,456 --> 01:38:05,248
We can't do that.

969
01:38:05,789 --> 01:38:07,664
We're going down to the station first.

970
01:38:08,748 --> 01:38:09,998
OK, thanks.

971
01:38:42,123 --> 01:38:44,289
I can read if you want.

972
01:38:47,248 --> 01:38:48,539
My name is Martín.

973
01:38:49,289 --> 01:38:52,206
This is my first reading
at one of these workshops.

974
01:39:06,498 --> 01:39:08,414
I have electric dreams

975
01:39:10,248 --> 01:39:13,164
Where my dad, when he can't fix something,

976
01:39:14,664 --> 01:39:16,039
Smashes it on the ground

977
01:39:18,331 --> 01:39:20,706
He gets angry, shouts, calls names

978
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:25,081
We scream our love for each other,
sometimes with blows

979
01:39:29,123 --> 01:39:30,414
That's what we are

980
01:39:31,956 --> 01:39:34,956
A pack of wild animals
with dreams of humanity

981
01:39:38,331 --> 01:39:41,206
Sometimes one needs several lives
to comprehend this

982
01:39:45,498 --> 01:39:48,081
The rage that runs through us
doesn't belong to us.
