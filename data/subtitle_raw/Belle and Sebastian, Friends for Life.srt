00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,309
<i>It was St. Sebastian's feast day.</i>

3
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:12,225
<i>I got caught in a blizzard.</i>

4
00:01:13,392 --> 00:01:17,184
<i>I headed for Grand Baou,
where there's a shelter.</i>

5
00:01:19,933 --> 00:01:21,434
<i>That's when I saw her.</i>

6
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:15,392
It's my first.

7
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:19,392
Same here.

8
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:21,892
Save him. Save my child!

9
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:27,808
Help!

10
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:45,975
Save him.

11
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:50,892
Push.

12
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,558
What are we going to call you?

00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:57,225
{\an8}<i>Saint-Martin, January 1948</i>

14
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:58,475
Stop!

15
00:03:58,516 --> 00:03:59,725
Sebastian!

16
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,892
Sebastian?

17
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:02,808
Stop it!

18
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:04,808
We said, not in your room.

19
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,850
Sure.

20
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:08,391
Stop it.

21
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:09,309
Well?

22
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:12,767
Well, I've no idea how they got here.

23
00:04:12,808 --> 00:04:14,475
Yes, I bet.

24
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:15,683
Belle!

25
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:17,267
We said, not in my room.

26
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,683
Come and give me a hand.

27
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:22,850
Come on.

28

<i>WORLD'S BRAVEST DOG
Gives Birth to Three Puppies</i>

29
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:53,933
Watch out, it's César's honey!

30
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,391
Let go of that. Stop it!

31
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:06,934
Let go, I said.

32
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,600
No, you stay there.

33
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,017
You're kidding!

34
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:12,017
Where's number 3?

35
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:13,642
Sebastian?

36
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Everything ok?

37
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:17,767
Great!

38
00:05:30,892 --> 00:05:32,725
That's sweet. Good girl.

39
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:35,433
Belle, get the salt ready.

40
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:37,725
Stop it, I said.

41
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:38,767
No!

42
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:41,683
No, let them get in.

43
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:45,934
The closer they get...

44
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:50,142
the better sheepdogs they become.

45
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,975
Sebastian, you're late for school.

46
00:05:54,017 --> 00:05:55,558
Dad, not today. Please!

47
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,350
Today, tomorrow, every day. School!
What is this?

48
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:00,850
Can't you talk to him?

49
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:02,266
He's right. Go!

50
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:03,266
Sebastian, now.

51
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,308
Hurry!

52
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:09,308
A farmer harvests eight apples

53
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,308
and seven pears a day.

54
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:15,433
Every month,
he sells his harvest at market.

55
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,892
If one apple costs three francs...

56
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:21,225
How big are they?

57
00:06:22,433 --> 00:06:24,184
About that big.

58
00:06:24,225 --> 00:06:26,308
You still haven't found names for them?

59
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,433
If you need some ideas...

60
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:31,183
Mistouflette!

61
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,433
- What?
- Who'll you give them to?

62
00:06:34,475 --> 00:06:35,600
To no one.

63
00:06:37,642 --> 00:06:39,892
100 lines.
"I must not talk in class."

64
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:40,808
100 lines?

65
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:42,934
200, why not!

66
00:06:42,975 --> 00:06:44,600
Good idea. 200 lines!

67
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,059
I'd like you all to take a copy.

68
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,059
Martine, please.

69
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,433
Hand these out.

70
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:56,558
Try to read five pages every day.

71
00:06:57,892 --> 00:06:59,350
Are we agreed, Sebastian?

72
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:01,391
<i>The Three Mosquitoes</i>?

73
00:07:01,934 --> 00:07:03,391
Musketeers, not mosquitoes.

74
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:05,142
Please!

75
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:08,475
See you tomorrow.

76
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,892
- Something wrong?
- No, why?

77
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:15,266
I'm 12.
I don't need picking up at school.

78
00:07:16,475 --> 00:07:20,017
I thought it's a nice day
to go up to Grand Baou.

79
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:22,767
- But if you don't want to...
- Sure, I do.

80
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:23,934
You have no homework?

81
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:25,475
No.

82
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:27,308
Race you!

83
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:15,308
I'm beat!

84
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:18,600
I don't believe it!

85
00:08:20,475 --> 00:08:21,600
Any ideas?

86
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,058
You lose.

87
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:57,308
Come on, don't brag!

88
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,850
Not so long ago, I always won.

89
00:09:01,433 --> 00:09:02,558
That was before.

90
00:09:14,892 --> 00:09:16,016
I'm listening.

91
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,266
- Feels great here.
- Yes.

92
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,892
Fly through the clouds in a plane

93
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,350
and the sky's amazingly blue.

94
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:34,016
Pierre and I are in love,
you know?

95
00:09:34,058 --> 00:09:35,016
Sure, come on!

96
00:09:38,517 --> 00:09:40,266
What I wanted to tell you is...

97
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:42,684
Pierre and I are getting married.

98
00:09:47,975 --> 00:09:49,725
I want to be sure...

99
00:09:51,517 --> 00:09:53,225
He's your father.
I'm your aunt.

100
00:09:53,266 --> 00:09:55,100
Not my real aunt.

101
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:56,225
That's true.

102
00:09:56,266 --> 00:09:57,392
So it's all good.

103
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Just one thing.

104
00:10:07,058 --> 00:10:08,058
Yes?

105
00:10:08,892 --> 00:10:10,600
I won't have to call you mommy?

106
00:10:12,016 --> 00:10:13,684
- 'Course not.
- It'd feel weird.

107
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:16,100
Absolutely.

108
00:10:23,016 --> 00:10:26,141
BELLE AND SEBASTIAN 3:

109
00:10:26,183 --> 00:10:28,975
THE LAST CHAPTER

110
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:00,058
About time!

111
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:06,684
You may kiss!

112
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:33,433
Here.

113
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:41,517
To defend the house
while we're gone.

114
00:12:43,433 --> 00:12:45,267
You know this changes nothing.

115
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:47,183
What? The knife?

116
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,475
No, not the knife.

117
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,433
Here. It's tradition.

118
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:57,517
Or it only cuts friendship.

119
00:13:03,308 --> 00:13:04,225
She's beautiful.

120
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:08,308
You already slept with her?

121
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,392
You bet.

122
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,058
So you know she snores.

123
00:13:16,475 --> 00:13:18,559
- Keep it under your hat.
- OK.

124
00:13:43,434 --> 00:13:44,559
Dare you.

125
00:13:46,142 --> 00:13:47,350
You don't dare!

126
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,850
Good?

127
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:55,308
Yucky.

128
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,475
I understand, obviously.

129
00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:05,308
And Sebastian?

130
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:07,308
What about Sebastian?

131
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,642
What does Sebastian say?

132
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:12,100
We haven't told him yet.

133
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,475
We're going for two weeks

134
00:14:14,517 --> 00:14:17,891
to land a contract
and a place at university.

135
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:19,600
If all goes to plan, we move in May.

136
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:22,891
What did you tell the boy?

137
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,850
That it's our honeymoon.

138
00:14:25,975 --> 00:14:29,142
You agreed?
Your little savage going to Canada?

139
00:14:29,183 --> 00:14:31,850
Sure I agreed.
His place is with his father.

140
00:14:31,891 --> 00:14:33,725
Even so! Montreal's a big city.

141
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,058
Nothing like Saint-Martin.

142
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:38,183
He can't spend all his life here.

143
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:40,267
He's a lucky boy.

144
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:42,891
Getting to see the world.

145
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,891
To wedded bliss!

146
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:48,891
Good health!

147
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,642
If the mini-Belles
take after their mother, goodness!

148
00:14:57,183 --> 00:14:58,267
Yup.

149
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,766
Something else, those dogs.

150
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:03,434
You'll keep one for me?

151
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:06,559
Dream on!

152
00:15:07,058 --> 00:15:09,683
Those babies
are out of your price range.

153
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:12,559
Even if you win,
and let's admit it, that's unlikely.

154
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:14,766
They're not for sale.

155
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:18,017
Anyway, they're not his.

156
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,975
You never wanted her.

157
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,350
But you'd profit from her pups?

158
00:15:30,183 --> 00:15:31,183
Their place

159
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:32,641
is with their mother.

160
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,392
No?

161
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:39,808
Will you listen?

162
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:42,017
When they've been weaned...

163
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:47,725
Come on, play!

164
00:16:03,434 --> 00:16:05,891
Don't worry, it's only two weeks.

165
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:08,267
We'll talk to him when we're sure.

166
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:11,183
Trust him.

167
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:13,392
He'll understand. He's 12.

168
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:16,309
We should've told him the truth.

169
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,350
If he sees you happy, he'll be happy.

170
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:22,225
Happy?

171
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:30,808
Let's see. Much better.

172
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,017
Let's go, Pierrot.

173
00:16:55,142 --> 00:16:56,182
Stop that.

174
00:16:58,892 --> 00:16:59,933
I won't go.

175
00:17:01,392 --> 00:17:03,017
They're liars, don't you see?

176
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:34,892
I know you're not asleep.

177
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,058
I only have 30 sheep.

178
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,434
Four sheepdogs is a lot for 30 sheep.

179
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:47,142
You know I don't give a fig about money.

180
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,933
Even Belle knows her pups
will leave one day.

181
00:17:51,516 --> 00:17:52,725
Not tomorrow but...

182
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:57,100
One day. That's life.

183
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:58,516
It's how things work.

184
00:17:59,434 --> 00:18:01,142
You'll leave too, one day.

185
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:03,225
You'll be celebrating.

186
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,142
Getting rid of me.

187
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,975
What are you talking about?

188
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:13,641
What will you do here?
Be a shepherd like me?

189
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,142
Why not?

190
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,892
You deserve better.

191
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,058
And you don't deserve better?

192
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,350
I had no choice.

193
00:18:22,808 --> 00:18:24,058
I never went to school.

194
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:28,142
Never saw the world?

195
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,184
Sleep well.

196
00:20:03,142 --> 00:20:05,184
César's place, you know it?

197
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,767
I'll take you if you want.

198
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:09,350
And I won't say no.

199
00:20:39,017 --> 00:20:41,850
- Is it American?
- No, it's a half-track.

200
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:44,475
Belonged to a German colonel.

201
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:46,017
My dad stole a German plane.

202
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:49,350
This isn't stolen. I won it.

203
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:51,683
Won it?

204
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:54,184
With that.

205
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,100
Can you play?

206
00:20:58,516 --> 00:21:00,433
Pick them up, they won't bite.

207
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:04,017
How about a bet?
You roll a die

208
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:06,267
and if it comes up 1, 2 or 3,

209
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,142
I guess your first name.

210
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,391
4, 5 or 6,

211
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,059
you guess mine.

212
00:21:13,975 --> 00:21:15,767
Go on, where's the risk?

213
00:21:21,892 --> 00:21:23,391
Beginner's luck.

214
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,850
I'm Joseph. Now let me guess...

215
00:21:26,892 --> 00:21:28,267
Your name is...

216
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:34,767
Your name's...

217
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,059
Can't get it.

218
00:21:38,892 --> 00:21:40,225
I give up, Sebastian.

219
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,850
When I saw the newspaper,
I couldn't believe it.

220
00:22:23,266 --> 00:22:26,934
Just imagine, four years,
looking all over for my dog.

221
00:22:27,934 --> 00:22:28,934
What's he say?

222
00:22:28,975 --> 00:22:31,808
Four years is a long time.
I thought she was dead.

223
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,433
What proves she's yours?

224
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:36,934
See, she recognizes me.

225
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,683
She's hardly overjoyed.

226
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,308
Sorry, but you turn up

227
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,100
out of nowhere
claiming she's your dog!

228
00:22:43,934 --> 00:22:45,100
Tell me another!

229
00:22:45,142 --> 00:22:46,475
All patous look alike.

230
00:22:46,516 --> 00:22:48,934
Not all patous have a scarred left ear.

231
00:22:51,225 --> 00:22:52,892
A V-shaped scar.

232
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:57,142
She got it as a pup
climbing a fence.

233
00:22:57,184 --> 00:23:00,017
Garbage! I bet you did it!

234
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,516
André told me you tied her up.

235
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:03,808
And beat her.

236
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,767
Me?

237
00:23:05,683 --> 00:23:07,600
I'd never harm a dog.

238
00:23:09,142 --> 00:23:10,475
I'd be a monster.

239
00:23:10,517 --> 00:23:12,059
She was rake thin when I found her.

240
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,017
You found her? So she's not yours.

241
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:15,975
But...

242
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:18,892
You did a great job.
I can't thank you enough.

243
00:23:18,934 --> 00:23:20,934
Sorry the kid grew attached...

244
00:23:20,975 --> 00:23:22,391
Bring me my shotgun.

245
00:23:34,142 --> 00:23:35,683
I advise you to leave.

246
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:38,725
You're taking this all wrong.

247
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:42,142
Think it over a few days.

248
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:45,642
Give the kid time to say farewell.

249
00:23:47,517 --> 00:23:48,850
To the dog.

250
00:24:01,183 --> 00:24:02,475
We'll come up with a solution.

251
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:07,100
Don't worry. She's staying with us.

252
00:24:07,141 --> 00:24:08,059
Trust me.

253
00:24:40,892 --> 00:24:42,225
Belle isn't yours.

254
00:24:43,141 --> 00:24:44,225
And never will be.

255
00:24:44,266 --> 00:24:45,391
Want to bet on it?

256
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,059
What did he say?

257
00:25:12,266 --> 00:25:13,266
Nothing.

258
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:16,433
Come on inside.

259
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:18,683
Why Belle? He never loved her.

260
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,433
Those dogs are worth money.

261
00:25:20,475 --> 00:25:23,017
- It sucks.
- You're right, it sucks.

262
00:25:23,058 --> 00:25:26,725
César. We have a big problem.

263
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,308
Look...

264
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:35,058
I don't want to cause problems.

265
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,892
Give me my dog
and this goes no further.

266
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:41,058
The gentleman
has signed statements from his village.

267
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,017
They all say Belle's his dog
and mention the scar in her ear.

268
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:46,183
That proves nothing.

269
00:25:47,141 --> 00:25:49,308
It proves the dog is mine.

270
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,017
Dogs aren't property.

271
00:25:51,058 --> 00:25:52,517
They follow those they love.

272
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,517
About the pups...

273
00:25:56,475 --> 00:25:57,642
The pups?

274
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,308
We can't give him the pups!

275
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:05,016
Remember what André said?
He beat her, tied her up, starved her!

276
00:26:05,058 --> 00:26:07,141
We'll ask him to write a letter!

277
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:09,225
André likes a drop to drink, you know.

278
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:10,725
You won't stop this?

279
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:12,725
Blame the law, not me.

280
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,975
The dog stays here.

281
00:26:17,016 --> 00:26:19,350
Fine. I'll be back with the police.

282
00:26:19,392 --> 00:26:20,850
We'll be here.

283
00:26:24,767 --> 00:26:26,183
I don't write the laws.

284
00:26:26,934 --> 00:26:28,016
Too bad.

285
00:26:32,266 --> 00:26:33,517
Wait here.

286
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:34,892
Wait here for me, I said.

287
00:26:38,642 --> 00:26:39,975
I'll buy her off you.

288
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:53,767
I'll give you 10,000 francs.

289
00:26:57,141 --> 00:26:58,517
That's a lot of money.

290
00:26:59,016 --> 00:27:00,975
Isn't it why you're here?

291
00:27:01,016 --> 00:27:02,934
You'll have to sell your house.

292
00:27:03,725 --> 00:27:05,517
- My problem.
- 30,000!

293
00:27:11,975 --> 00:27:13,141
20.

294
00:27:13,183 --> 00:27:14,225
20,000?

295
00:27:17,892 --> 00:27:19,183
How much for the pups?

296
00:27:20,308 --> 00:27:21,558
You scumbag!

297
00:27:37,141 --> 00:27:38,267
Listen to me...

298
00:27:41,684 --> 00:27:43,892
Don't worry,
I'll come up with something.

299
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,433
You will?

300
00:27:47,392 --> 00:27:49,141
Your dad won't allow this.

301
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:51,975
My dad comes back in ten days.

302
00:27:52,684 --> 00:27:56,016
We'll play for time.
I've helped the police out plenty.

303
00:27:57,183 --> 00:27:58,600
I'll explain everything.

304
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:04,475
We have no choice.

305
00:29:40,767 --> 00:29:42,016
Stay there.

306
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,850
Belle, we need to take vegetables.

307
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,142
You'll wake César.

308
00:30:21,725 --> 00:30:23,725
Taking a vacation, Sebastian?

309
00:30:40,183 --> 00:30:41,891
Why the long face?

310
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,058
Some you win, some you lose.

311
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,475
Some days you're alive...

312
00:30:52,766 --> 00:30:53,850
Some day you're dead.

313
00:30:56,183 --> 00:30:58,642
Whatever happens, you don't choose.

314
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,100
Ever.

315
00:31:02,808 --> 00:31:03,850
Well played!

316
00:31:07,308 --> 00:31:08,434
Let's go, Belle!

317
00:31:20,475 --> 00:31:22,058
Sebastian, time to get up!

318
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:33,392
<i>You said I'd have to leave one day.
That day is now.</i>

319
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:43,559
No way!

320
00:32:04,808 --> 00:32:06,183
What are you doing here?

321
00:32:10,142 --> 00:32:11,725
Where have they gone to hide?

322
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,808
Your boy took my dog.
Where are they?

323
00:32:17,975 --> 00:32:19,267
You're on my land.

324
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,600
Beat it!

325
00:32:24,517 --> 00:32:27,350
The dog ends up in my half-track.
Believe me.

326
00:32:48,808 --> 00:32:52,142
We'll hide out at Molines.
They'll never look there.

327
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:55,559
Look, it's just behind that mountain.

328
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,350
Coming straight at us.

329
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,892
We gotta hurry.

330
00:33:44,766 --> 00:33:45,766
Keep going!

331
00:33:49,975 --> 00:33:51,225
Come on, Belle!

332
00:34:01,766 --> 00:34:03,392
You can do it, Belle.

333
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:29,683
That's right, Belle!

334
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,808
Keep going!

335
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,309
Belle's with him. He'll make it.

336
00:35:45,392 --> 00:35:46,975
No thanks to your stupid laws.

337
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,558
César...

338
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,309
Stay with me.

339
00:36:55,225 --> 00:36:56,142
Mom?

340
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:00,725
Don't sleep, my son.

341
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:02,059
Don't sleep.

342
00:40:02,142 --> 00:40:03,642
Thank you, Belle!

343
00:40:19,558 --> 00:40:20,892
You saved us.

344
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:11,350
Look!

345
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:15,017
We're there.

346
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:16,850
We did it.

347
00:42:04,934 --> 00:42:07,225
Just perfect. Great, isn't it?

348
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:26,975
I have a plan.

349
00:42:27,517 --> 00:42:29,225
We stay here till spring.

350
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:31,809
Then we cross into Italy.

351
00:42:32,558 --> 00:42:36,058
Over there, I'll find a flock
to herd in the mountains.

352
00:42:37,225 --> 00:42:38,475
We'll earn our living.

353
00:42:42,725 --> 00:42:44,642
In winter, I'll do odd jobs.

354
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:46,892
People always need a handyman.

355
00:42:47,684 --> 00:42:49,183
The following spring...

356
00:42:53,850 --> 00:42:55,558
The following spring, we start over.

357
00:43:05,392 --> 00:43:06,850
Stop that!

358
00:43:10,517 --> 00:43:12,350
You're stopping me working.

359
00:43:12,392 --> 00:43:13,975
Come on, out the way.

360
00:43:17,767 --> 00:43:19,058
Get off me!

361
00:43:33,392 --> 00:43:34,392
No!

362
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,558
That's not food.

363
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,725
Walnuts,

364
00:43:41,767 --> 00:43:43,517
cheese, jelly...

365
00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:45,767
Chestnuts

366
00:43:45,809 --> 00:43:47,100
and dried sausage.

367
00:43:57,183 --> 00:43:58,141
One slice for you.

368
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,725
Tomorrow, we go hunting.

369
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,933
Dad and Angelina...

370
00:44:24,725 --> 00:44:26,558
You think they'll make babies?

371
00:44:39,725 --> 00:44:41,933
"This is the gentleman I will fight,"

372
00:44:41,975 --> 00:44:44,975
said Athos,
while pointing to d'Artagnan

373
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,559
and saluting him with the same gesture.

374
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,475
"I shall also fight him," said Porthos.

375
00:44:52,767 --> 00:44:55,433
"Not before one o'clock,"
replied d'Artagnan.

376
00:44:55,475 --> 00:44:59,058
"I am also to fight this gentleman,"
said Aramis,

377
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,725
coming over to them.

378
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:04,891
Yes, Mr. Mayor, a big patou,
pups and a kid.

379
00:45:04,933 --> 00:45:06,684
That's the word, "extraordinary."

380
00:45:06,725 --> 00:45:10,183
If you see them,
call me back right away.

381
00:45:10,225 --> 00:45:12,850
Whatever you do,
don't tell them anything.

382
00:45:12,891 --> 00:45:13,933
I appreciate it.

383
00:45:17,767 --> 00:45:19,100
We keep going.

384
00:45:19,684 --> 00:45:21,308
It's more than two days.

385
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,517
- Shouldn't you tell his father?
- I can't reach them.

386
00:45:26,183 --> 00:45:28,475
Well, now, next!

387
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,058
Next up, Saint-Vincent-sur-Jabron.

388
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,433
Here we go.

389
00:46:02,891 --> 00:46:04,559
Didn't you get the plan?

390
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:18,517
Numerous sheep

391
00:46:19,433 --> 00:46:20,517
played

392
00:46:22,183 --> 00:46:23,808
safely

393
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:27,600
in the yard.

394
00:46:31,308 --> 00:46:32,891
Numerousss... sheep

395
00:46:35,475 --> 00:46:36,933
pla-yed

396
00:46:38,642 --> 00:46:40,642
sa-fe-ly

397
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,642
in the yard.

398
00:46:44,392 --> 00:46:46,308
As a result,

399
00:46:46,975 --> 00:46:48,559
the shepherd

400
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:51,975
was reassured.

401
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,225
What's up?

402
00:47:13,808 --> 00:47:14,975
What's wrong?

403
00:47:26,517 --> 00:47:29,225
Why'd I suggest
taking turns in the bed?

404
00:47:36,267 --> 00:47:38,100
Four days he's been missing!

405
00:47:38,142 --> 00:47:40,058
My dad says he's dead.

406
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,766
Come on, children. Inside!

407
00:48:00,058 --> 00:48:01,434
<i>Town Hall</i>

408
00:48:01,475 --> 00:48:02,725
All right...

409
00:48:03,183 --> 00:48:04,350
Thanks, Hubert.

410
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:08,142
Call me if you hear anything. Thanks.

411
00:48:09,683 --> 00:48:10,808
That's the whole list.

412
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,559
Every village
within a radius of 40 km.

413
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,475
Tell me there's more we can do.

414
00:48:27,933 --> 00:48:29,142
Picture it up there.

415
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,559
Minus 30º at night.

416
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,308
Too much snow to start a fire.
Horrific!

417
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:34,975
If there's an avalanche...

418
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:41,725
If he encounters a wolf...

419
00:48:50,641 --> 00:48:51,600
You know?

420
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:54,309
Yes.

421
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:56,142
Molines!

422
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,850
Later, Louis.

423
00:48:57,891 --> 00:48:59,600
Why didn't I think of that?

424
00:49:00,517 --> 00:49:03,600
We stayed in summer with the flock.
Sebastian loved it.

425
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:04,641
What do we do?

426
00:49:05,517 --> 00:49:07,434
Break out your Supermini.

427
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:41,641
Promise me you'll accelerate sometime.

428
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:52,475
The brake's not the accelerator.

429
00:49:57,017 --> 00:49:59,350
My mule would've gone faster.

430
00:49:59,933 --> 00:50:01,100
Be quiet!

431
00:50:01,142 --> 00:50:03,225
- What?
- I can't concentrate!

432
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,392
To drive at 2 km/h?

433
00:50:14,558 --> 00:50:17,267
- Turn!
- I've lost control!

434
00:50:25,183 --> 00:50:26,267
You're kidding me!

435
00:50:28,142 --> 00:50:29,517
It's your fault.

436
00:50:29,558 --> 00:50:31,267
Making me drive like a lunatic!

437
00:50:31,683 --> 00:50:33,309
Do you know where we are?

438
00:50:33,892 --> 00:50:35,350
Do you know?

439
00:50:35,392 --> 00:50:38,434
Somewhere between
Larcueil and Rougemont.

440
00:50:40,017 --> 00:50:41,975
Nowhere! That's where we are!

441
00:50:42,017 --> 00:50:43,392
Don't get out!

442
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,475
- Let me help you.
- Leave me alone!

443
00:50:49,517 --> 00:50:50,475
Leave me alone!

444
00:50:50,517 --> 00:50:52,309
- I'm trying to help.
- Leave me alone!

445
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,725
- Pain in the ass!
- You pigheaded...

446
00:51:07,434 --> 00:51:10,309
- The salesman told you what to do?
- Do what?

447
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:18,766
Reassure me...

448
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:20,975
You can change a wheel?

449
00:51:47,892 --> 00:51:49,475
Stop, you'll scare them off.

450
00:51:53,017 --> 00:51:54,058
Got one!

451
00:51:59,392 --> 00:52:01,267
We said we'd stock up.

452
00:52:54,017 --> 00:52:54,933
What's up?

453
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,516
I promised to protect them.

454
00:55:15,184 --> 00:55:16,350
No, it's me...

455
00:55:18,225 --> 00:55:19,683
It's my fault.

456
00:55:22,433 --> 00:55:23,808
He'll kill her.

457
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,142
He'll kill her to get back at her.

458
00:55:47,391 --> 00:55:48,600
He followed me.

459
00:55:49,266 --> 00:55:51,059
He's always a step ahead.

460
00:55:52,892 --> 00:55:54,558
I'm too old.

461
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,308
No, I'm too little.

462
00:56:03,308 --> 00:56:04,934
Good job for a little kid.

463
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:07,475
See, I have my uses.

464
00:56:09,308 --> 00:56:11,266
Why let them take me to Canada?

465
00:56:14,266 --> 00:56:17,100
Under the table at the wedding,
I heard you.

466
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:20,433
Why let them take me to Canada?

467
00:56:23,266 --> 00:56:25,183
A boy's place is with his dad.

468
00:56:25,225 --> 00:56:27,100
You're more than my granddad.

469
00:56:27,142 --> 00:56:28,934
But I'm not your dad.

470
00:56:28,975 --> 00:56:30,142
You'll travel.

471
00:56:31,142 --> 00:56:33,059
I wish I had at your age.

472
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,517
Sure, but I'm not you.

473
00:56:38,808 --> 00:56:40,517
There are shepherds in Canada.

474
00:56:40,558 --> 00:56:41,934
All I want

475
00:56:41,975 --> 00:56:44,517
is to be a shepherd here with you.

476
00:56:45,017 --> 00:56:46,100
And Belle.

477
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:49,433
If I go, it'll never be the same.

478
00:56:49,475 --> 00:56:50,767
It could be better.

479
00:56:54,433 --> 00:56:55,683
We'll get them back.

480
00:56:56,475 --> 00:56:57,433
From his place.

481
00:56:58,767 --> 00:56:59,642
His place?

482
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,266
We won't let this go.

483
00:57:02,308 --> 00:57:03,558
We won't let this go.

484
00:57:07,266 --> 00:57:08,934
I came as fast as I could.

485
00:57:09,809 --> 00:57:11,391
C'mon, let's hit the road!

486
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:14,934
Let's go!

487
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,809
How about a rest first?

488
00:57:20,225 --> 00:57:21,141
Well...

489
00:57:30,725 --> 00:57:32,725
Aren't you happy to be home?

490
00:57:44,433 --> 00:57:46,225
Make the most of your pups.

491
00:57:49,558 --> 00:57:50,975
Your time's short.

492
00:58:13,934 --> 00:58:14,934
You were right.

493
00:58:16,225 --> 00:58:17,809
A little gem, this car.

494
00:58:18,433 --> 00:58:20,183
At Ormières, what's the plan?

495
00:58:22,892 --> 00:58:25,600
Like musketeers, head down and charge.

496
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:32,642
It's against the law.

497
00:58:34,558 --> 00:58:35,725
Is that a problem?

498
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:37,350
Not at all.

499
00:58:38,308 --> 00:58:39,392
Accelerate.

500
00:59:10,934 --> 00:59:13,350
We knock on doors
till we find Joseph.

501
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:14,975
Let's go.

502
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,725
Not like that!
It's hardly difficult.

503
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:20,433
Not like this, boss?

504
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:23,475
You don't put it to proof yet.

505
00:59:23,517 --> 00:59:25,266
How many times have I told you!

506
01:00:16,809 --> 01:00:18,058
Belle, wait!

507
01:00:18,558 --> 01:00:19,725
What's up with you?

508
01:00:31,225 --> 01:00:32,642
<i>Village School</i>

509
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:27,475
What's here?

510
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:28,975
What are you doing there?

511
01:01:29,684 --> 01:01:32,141
Your dog led me here.

512
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:35,517
My dog?

513
01:01:39,183 --> 01:01:41,100
What have you done now, Alba?

514
01:01:42,433 --> 01:01:44,392
What did you do to her?

515
01:01:45,141 --> 01:01:46,392
She's acting strange.

516
01:01:47,225 --> 01:01:48,725
It wasn't me, honestly.

517
01:01:48,767 --> 01:01:51,684
That's enough. I'll call the police.

518
01:01:51,725 --> 01:01:52,767
No, wait!

519
01:01:55,642 --> 01:01:57,475
I'm looking for Joseph.

520
01:01:57,517 --> 01:01:58,642
He stole my dog.

521
01:01:59,642 --> 01:02:00,809
You've lost me.

522
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,559
- What dog?
- Mine!

523
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,642
She looks just like yours,
except for the black eye.

524
01:02:05,684 --> 01:02:07,100
The liar said she's his!

525
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:08,850
Joseph?

526
01:02:10,308 --> 01:02:11,725
Your dog...

527
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:14,600
You had her 4 years, since summer '43?

528
01:02:15,016 --> 01:02:16,183
How do you know?

529
01:02:20,225 --> 01:02:21,308
She's her mother.

530
01:02:22,475 --> 01:02:25,809
I see now
why she sniffed you like that.

531
01:02:26,517 --> 01:02:27,809
She's Belle's mother?

532
01:02:28,975 --> 01:02:30,559
You called her Belle?

533
01:02:32,308 --> 01:02:33,350
Wonderful.

534
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,100
That's my grandfather.

535
01:02:39,433 --> 01:02:40,933
With our mayor.

536
01:02:41,475 --> 01:02:42,600
Here I am!

537
01:02:44,517 --> 01:02:47,392
Where did you get to?
We were looking all over.

538
01:02:47,433 --> 01:02:48,350
Hello.

539
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:52,559
Ma'am, sorry, I was scared for the kid.

540
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:53,475
Urbain.

541
01:02:54,183 --> 01:02:55,142
César.

542
01:02:55,183 --> 01:02:57,142
He's not a kid, he's 11.

543
01:02:57,183 --> 01:02:58,267
12.

544
01:02:58,308 --> 01:02:59,392
The name's Madeleine.

545
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:02,684
Is that Belle?

546
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:04,225
Her mother.

547
01:03:05,142 --> 01:03:06,517
Belle's mother?

548
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:07,684
Yes, not mine.

549
01:03:09,475 --> 01:03:10,808
- We're...
- I know.

550
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:12,933
- Where can...
- Follow me.

551
01:03:15,684 --> 01:03:19,725
- You've known Joseph long?
- He came to Ormières pre-war.

552
01:03:20,725 --> 01:03:22,308
This is where he lives.

553
01:03:25,766 --> 01:03:26,933
Gravedigger.

554
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,142
That figures.

555
01:03:33,016 --> 01:03:34,308
She got your scent.

556
01:03:37,142 --> 01:03:40,392
Don't worry, Alba,
we'll get her out of there.

557
01:03:48,725 --> 01:03:50,100
I've had it with him.

558
01:03:50,142 --> 01:03:51,142
What will you do?

559
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:55,142
With your arm, you'll be super useful.

560
01:03:56,350 --> 01:03:57,725
She's not wrong.

561
01:03:57,766 --> 01:03:59,642
Joseph isn't like you and me.

562
01:04:00,058 --> 01:04:01,808
We can't just do nothing.

563
01:04:02,434 --> 01:04:04,725
- We need a plan.
- Head down and charge.

564
01:04:04,766 --> 01:04:06,225
A real plan.

565
01:04:06,267 --> 01:04:07,975
Where we don't get caught.

566
01:04:08,016 --> 01:04:11,392
In the eyes of the law, the dog is his.

567
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:13,517
No, she's not his!

568
01:04:15,684 --> 01:04:16,891
Come with me.

569
01:04:38,725 --> 01:04:40,559
What did you say you do?

570
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,725
I'm a schoolteacher. Why?

571
01:04:44,058 --> 01:04:45,142
No reason.

572
01:04:54,308 --> 01:04:56,267
He was Belle's master.

573
01:04:56,308 --> 01:04:58,100
I gave him her
when he lost his sight.

574
01:04:59,267 --> 01:05:00,808
She was tiny.

575
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:03,225
But she knew René couldn't see.

576
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:06,600
That summer, she did it all.
Led the flock.

577
01:05:07,392 --> 01:05:09,100
Took the sheep out.

578
01:05:11,683 --> 01:05:13,267
And then...

579
01:05:13,308 --> 01:05:14,600
René died.

580
01:05:16,267 --> 01:05:17,766
Without an heir.

581
01:05:18,975 --> 01:05:21,559
The local shepherds
divvied up the sheep.

582
01:05:22,434 --> 01:05:23,933
Joseph snatched Belle.

583
01:05:24,475 --> 01:05:26,517
- Nobody stopped him?
- You mean me?

584
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:30,475
I'd have liked to see you try.

585
01:05:32,183 --> 01:05:34,475
Have you looked Joseph eye to eye?

586
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:38,600
He has this blank, deathly stare.

587
01:05:41,017 --> 01:05:42,517
And during the war,

588
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,683
he stood with the Krauts. I was scared.

589
01:05:45,725 --> 01:05:47,309
Everybody's scared of him.

590
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:50,850
And after the war?

591
01:05:52,183 --> 01:05:54,766
He stood with the Resistance.

592
01:05:54,808 --> 01:05:57,225
Miracles of the Armistice.

593
01:05:57,725 --> 01:05:59,517
Joseph's a smart cookie.

594
01:06:01,267 --> 01:06:03,392
How did Belle escape?

595
01:06:03,434 --> 01:06:05,309
She didn't. I let her go.

596
01:06:06,808 --> 01:06:08,309
She never stopped barking.

597
01:06:09,225 --> 01:06:10,683
But I couldn't keep her.

598
01:06:10,725 --> 01:06:13,559
He'd come for her. I told her to run.

599
01:06:14,975 --> 01:06:16,641
She has something different.

600
01:06:17,142 --> 01:06:19,933
I was sure some day
she'd meet someone.

601
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:21,975
Like you.

602
01:06:23,725 --> 01:06:26,100
There he is, going out.

603
01:06:26,933 --> 01:06:28,475
You all know what to do?

604
01:06:30,933 --> 01:06:32,225
You can do it?

605
01:06:33,017 --> 01:06:35,017
Keep him busy long enough?

606
01:06:35,434 --> 01:06:37,517
You know what your problem is?

607
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:39,933
You underestimate me.

608
01:08:06,099 --> 01:08:08,141
I hear you're a hotshot at cards.

609
01:08:12,891 --> 01:08:14,434
Little savage is here, too?

610
01:08:16,557 --> 01:08:18,017
He's taken to his bed.

611
01:08:18,724 --> 01:08:21,516
Cold and grief, a nasty combination.

612
01:08:21,558 --> 01:08:23,017
Especially at age 12.

613
01:08:24,766 --> 01:08:26,975
Sure, it's a fragile age.

614
01:08:27,974 --> 01:08:31,225
With an arm in a sling,
his granddad can't look after him.

615
01:08:34,057 --> 01:08:35,515
You should head home, too.

616
01:08:35,975 --> 01:08:37,683
Before you have an accident.

617
01:08:40,434 --> 01:08:41,849
Renault Supermini.

618
01:08:42,392 --> 01:08:44,309
Play you for it. Five rounds.

619
01:08:46,725 --> 01:08:48,017
If you win...

620
01:08:49,141 --> 01:08:50,474
the car's yours.

621
01:08:50,974 --> 01:08:52,641
If I win,

622
01:08:52,683 --> 01:08:55,392
I leave here with the dog and her pups.

623
01:08:55,433 --> 01:08:56,682
Why'd I bite?

624
01:08:57,766 --> 01:08:59,767
They're my dogs and I have a car.

625
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:02,600
Turns out, you're scared.

626
01:09:12,225 --> 01:09:13,641
Scared of what?

627
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,849
Scared of losing.

628
01:09:42,142 --> 01:09:43,433
Let's play!

629
01:09:54,933 --> 01:09:56,142
Don't shout!

630
01:09:57,933 --> 01:09:59,391
He's alone in there!

631
01:09:59,433 --> 01:10:00,683
We're here.

632
01:10:04,725 --> 01:10:05,850
I see.

633
01:10:07,142 --> 01:10:08,516
Stubborn.

634
01:10:08,558 --> 01:10:09,933
Stubborn as an ass.

635
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:27,683
It's over. I'm here now.

636
01:10:35,309 --> 01:10:37,267
You recognized us.

637
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:39,184
You remember us.

638
01:10:44,475 --> 01:10:46,142
Damn thing!

639
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:48,808
Leave it to me.

640
01:10:49,975 --> 01:10:51,309
Nearly there.

641
01:10:52,683 --> 01:10:54,142
What if Urbain flops?

642
01:10:54,184 --> 01:10:55,475
Urbain's unbeatable.

643
01:11:13,767 --> 01:11:15,391
There we go.

644
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:17,892
Two rounds to none.

645
01:11:18,683 --> 01:11:20,933
In double-quick time.

646
01:11:21,475 --> 01:11:22,892
Let's play.

647
01:11:29,642 --> 01:11:31,184
Bolt cutter's useless!

648
01:11:31,225 --> 01:11:32,516
Do you need a hand?

649
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,142
I know now why I never wed.

650
01:11:35,184 --> 01:11:37,975
Unbelievable! The bolt cutter's useless!

651
01:11:38,017 --> 01:11:39,475
Come on, my turn.

652
01:12:09,642 --> 01:12:11,558
What are you looking at?

653
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:34,892
You gotta be somewhere?

654
01:12:38,391 --> 01:12:39,475
No.

655
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:06,517
If my dog's gone,

656
01:13:06,558 --> 01:13:09,558
you and your Supermini
are going over the edge.

657
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,350
Time's up!
We'll be back for them, I promise.

658
01:13:16,391 --> 01:13:19,808
If he catches us and moves them,
we'll lose him for good.

659
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:21,808
What are you doing? Let's go!

660
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:23,350
Not without her.

661
01:13:23,391 --> 01:13:24,433
We're inseparable.

662
01:13:27,642 --> 01:13:30,017
Stubborn. Just like his granddad!

663
01:13:30,059 --> 01:13:31,600
Where'd you learn that?

664
01:13:31,642 --> 01:13:33,475
Practicing on locks at school.

665
01:13:33,892 --> 01:13:36,350
- That's cheating.
- Who cares!

666
01:13:47,225 --> 01:13:49,433
Go that way. Quickly!

667
01:13:49,475 --> 01:13:50,975
Hide with the dogs.

668
01:14:18,642 --> 01:14:20,100
Where are they?

669
01:14:20,141 --> 01:14:22,308
What are you going to do? Kill us?

670
01:14:24,141 --> 01:14:25,517
It's all over.

671
01:14:27,141 --> 01:14:29,183
The dog isn't yours.

672
01:14:30,266 --> 01:14:31,517
She never was.

673
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,475
You want us to call the police?

674
01:14:35,517 --> 01:14:37,141
They'll help you find them!

675
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:41,141
Don't do anything stupid!

676
01:14:46,017 --> 01:14:48,059
If you touch a hair on his head,

677
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,975
I swear I'll kill you!

678
01:15:08,767 --> 01:15:09,642
What now?

679
01:15:10,433 --> 01:15:11,600
We pray

680
01:15:12,725 --> 01:15:14,725
that Sebastian found a hideout.

681
01:15:41,642 --> 01:15:43,308
Want to play hide-and-seek?

682
01:15:43,892 --> 01:15:45,266
Not a sound!

683
01:15:45,308 --> 01:15:47,725
It's a dangerous game in a graveyard.

684
01:15:48,767 --> 01:15:50,934
You could stumble on a corpse.

685
01:15:50,975 --> 01:15:52,767
You ever see a corpse?

686
01:15:53,684 --> 01:15:55,058
Don't make a sound.

687
01:15:57,433 --> 01:15:59,058
Know what it's like, a corpse?

688
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,475
At first...

689
01:16:05,725 --> 01:16:06,934
it's terrifying.

690
01:16:08,684 --> 01:16:11,058
But very soon it becomes fascinating.

691
01:16:11,892 --> 01:16:13,016
Emptiness.

692
01:16:14,392 --> 01:16:15,475
Nothingness.

693
01:16:17,934 --> 01:16:19,433
Silence.

694
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:38,767
Found you!

695
01:16:39,475 --> 01:16:40,892
I know you're in there.

696
01:16:42,308 --> 01:16:43,850
I'm sure you're in there.

697
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:45,809
You're there!

698
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:47,141
Let me see you.

699
01:16:51,975 --> 01:16:53,392
You're good at this.

700
01:17:23,141 --> 01:17:25,350
Don't move. Stay right there!

701
01:17:25,392 --> 01:17:26,600
I'll be back for you.

702
01:17:41,267 --> 01:17:42,767
You can't escape me.

703
01:17:55,975 --> 01:17:56,975
Hurry!

704
01:18:00,183 --> 01:18:01,267
Go on, Belle.

705
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,767
Go on, Belle. Run!

706
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:31,684
Please! Don't hurt her.

707
01:18:38,517 --> 01:18:39,642
Go ahead.

708
01:18:41,475 --> 01:18:42,975
What are you waiting for?

709
01:18:43,559 --> 01:18:44,642
Go on!

710
01:19:27,016 --> 01:19:28,392
Come on, beauty.

711
01:19:49,517 --> 01:19:50,475
No!

712
01:21:40,559 --> 01:21:42,392
We haven't got all day.

713
01:21:42,434 --> 01:21:44,392
It takes the time it takes.

714
01:21:45,058 --> 01:21:46,058
There we go.

715
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:47,559
That's pretty nasty.

716
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,850
- What's that?
- Disinfectant.

717
01:21:49,891 --> 01:21:50,975
Stinks.

718
01:21:51,017 --> 01:21:53,350
Stinks, but it's necessary.

719
01:21:53,392 --> 01:21:55,766
- Look at this wound.
- Nobody asked you to.

720
01:21:55,808 --> 01:21:58,725
Of course!
You'd prefer it to get infected?

721
01:22:00,517 --> 01:22:01,891
Hold still!

722
01:22:01,933 --> 01:22:04,600
- Try being more gentle.
- What a softie!

723
01:22:04,642 --> 01:22:05,933
Unbelievable!

724
01:22:08,183 --> 01:22:11,517
Softie, stubborn as an ass.

725
01:22:12,267 --> 01:22:15,100
Promise me,
you have some qualities.

726
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:20,392
When you gave her to the blind shepherd,

727
01:22:21,808 --> 01:22:23,434
weren't you sad?

728
01:22:23,475 --> 01:22:26,142
There comes a time
to part company.

729
01:22:26,183 --> 01:22:27,683
You sound like César.

730
01:22:27,725 --> 01:22:29,475
And a time to reunite.

731
01:22:29,517 --> 01:22:31,891
Your grandfather talks sense sometimes.

732
01:22:33,808 --> 01:22:35,475
Just not very often.

733
01:22:48,850 --> 01:22:51,183
You're lucky,
going to Canada, flying there!

734
01:22:51,225 --> 01:22:52,933
You found names for them?

735
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:55,725
Athos, Porthos...

736
01:22:55,766 --> 01:22:56,850
And Aramis?

737
01:22:57,808 --> 01:22:59,142
Who's he for?

738
01:23:06,017 --> 01:23:07,517
What'll I do with this?

739
01:23:08,725 --> 01:23:11,058
It won't stop growing
and making a mess.

740
01:23:11,766 --> 01:23:13,350
Madeleine will help you.

741
01:23:14,808 --> 01:23:16,267
She's good with dogs.

742
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:17,975
Yeah.

743
01:23:23,017 --> 01:23:25,100
When I was caught in the blizzard,

744
01:23:25,891 --> 01:23:27,142
I saw my mother.

745
01:23:27,725 --> 01:23:28,975
Your mother?

746
01:23:29,017 --> 01:23:30,434
I know but...

747
01:23:30,475 --> 01:23:31,558
I saw her.

748
01:23:33,892 --> 01:23:35,183
She saved me.

749
01:23:36,975 --> 01:23:38,100
I believe you.

750
01:23:42,766 --> 01:23:43,725
I'm here.

751
01:23:44,142 --> 01:23:45,558
I'm not going anywhere.

752
01:23:46,225 --> 01:23:48,392
Sir, it's time to go.

753
01:23:51,225 --> 01:23:52,975
Go on, hurry.

754
01:23:53,017 --> 01:23:55,600
No tears, okay? This isn't goodbye.

755
01:23:56,225 --> 01:23:57,808
Look after him.

756
01:23:59,225 --> 01:24:01,392
I know you'll keep him safe.

757
01:24:02,975 --> 01:24:04,975
Don't forget the maple syrup.

758
01:24:05,017 --> 01:24:06,641
I heard it's delicious.

759
01:24:09,183 --> 01:24:11,017
You think it tastes of trees?

760
01:24:17,142 --> 01:24:18,267
I love you!

761
01:24:18,766 --> 01:24:20,309
I love you!

762
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:30,933
{\an8}The End
