1
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:26,956
In Cairo, a muezzin calls
faithful Muslims to prayer.

2
00:00:33,727 --> 00:00:38,084
It's the same call that sounds
five times a day, every day,

3
00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:40,562
in cities across the world.

4
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:49,917
Nearly a quarter of the people
on earth respond to it,

5
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:08,446
'God is most great'
the muezzin calls.

6
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:14,722
'I testify
there is no other god but God.'

7
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:21,320
'I testify
Muhammad is the messenger of God.

8
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:30,203
'Come and pray.
Come and flourish.

9
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:35,127
'God is most great.

10
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:39,842
'There is no god but God.'

11
00:01:48,647 --> 00:01:50,922
In the unfolding of history,

12
00:01:50,923 --> 00:01:55,650
Islamic civilisation has been
one of humatiy's grandest achievements.

13
00:01:59,087 --> 00:02:03,046
A worldwide power
founded simply on faith.

14
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:09,547
A spiritual revolution that would
shape the nations of three continets

15
00:02:09,767 --> 00:02:12,122
and launch an empire.

16
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:19,800
For the West, much of the history
of Islam has been obscured

17
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:23,004
behind a veil of fear
and misunderstanding.

18
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:26,995
Yet Islam's hidden history
is deeply, and surprisingly,

19
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:30,643
interwoven with Western civilisation.

20
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:36,600
It was Muslim scholars who reclaimed
the ancient wisdom of Greeks.

21
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:39,405
While Europe languished
in the Dark Ages.

22
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:44,679
It was they who sowed the seeds
of the Renaissance,

23
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:48,596
600 years before the birth
of Leonardo da Vinci.

24
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,521
From the way we heal the sick...

25
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,000
to the numerals we use for counting...

26
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:06,996
cultures across the globe
have been shaped by Islamic civilisation.

27
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:14,258
But all this, began with the life
of a single, ordinary man,

28
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:20,759
and the profound message he proclaimed
would change the world forever.

29
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:25,243
His name was Muhammad.

30
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:07,726
To Muslims, the life of Muhammad
is a story revered.

31
00:04:07,927 --> 00:04:10,600
In its mysteries
as much as its certainties,

32
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:13,401
there are beliefs held sacred.

33
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:16,280
<i>Whatever we can tell
about the Prophet, of course,

34
00:04:16,487 --> 00:04:19,559
<i>is screened through the filter of what
has been preserved over the centuries

35
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,245
<i>and what people
have wanted to preserve.

36
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:24,203
<i>It's very difficult to pull out,

37
00:04:24,204 --> 00:04:27,445
<i>from all these different sources
that are very adoring,

38
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:30,325
<i>the ordinary human being...

39
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:44,920
We do know that Muhammad was born
in or around 570 AD

40
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,078
in the sun-blasted Arabian peninsula.

41
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:53,722
A land of savage scarcity

42
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:58,284
whose Bedouin tribes were locked
in a constant state of tribal war.

43
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:05,404
While still an infant,

44
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:09,964
Muhammad's parents gave him
his first taste of life in the desert.

45
00:05:10,607 --> 00:05:13,041
<i>Muhammad was from a town, Mecca,

46
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:15,920
<i>but he was sent off
to live with the Bedouin

47
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:18,001
<i>because the people
even the town of Mecca

48
00:05:18,002 --> 00:05:24,002
<i>felt that the Bedouin were the holders
of the deeper cultural Arab values.

49
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:28,524
<i>And the Bedouin view the towns people

50
00:05:28,525 --> 00:05:32,204
<i>as having lost their really authentic
roots in Arab culture

51
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,404
<i>and the poetry and animal husbandry

52
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:38,805
<i>and all the things that they do so well.

53
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:46,956
By the time Muhammad was six,
both of his parents had died

54
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:52,321
and he was taken under the protection
of his uncle, chief of his clan.

55
00:05:52,607 --> 00:05:56,043
Being an outsider
gave him a singular perspective.

56
00:05:56,927 --> 00:05:58,724
<i>He'd been orphaned early

57
00:05:58,927 --> 00:06:03,239
<i>and developed very early on
a passionate sense of concern

58
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:06,439
<i>for those who are left out of society.

59
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:09,162
<i>To be orphaned in a tribal society

60
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:13,201
<i>where clan and family relationships
are your keys to everything...

61
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:16,444
<i>success, status, honour, dignity...

62
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:21,006
<i>is to face what it really feels like
to be marginalised.

63
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:25,883
<i>That obviously had a very deep
impression on him as a young man.

64
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:32,963
<i>In some ways, it was detrimental,
of course, to grow up without parents.

65
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,886
<i>But in other ways
he was so adaptable.

66
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:38,965
<i>He had many parents.
He had many fathers.

67
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:42,398
<i>He had many mothers.
So it made him a child of everybody.

68
00:06:45,727 --> 00:06:50,278
Muhammad's clan, like Arabs
all across the Arabian peninsula,

69
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:55,003
would share the stories that had been
told and retold for generations.

70
00:06:57,687 --> 00:07:01,475
<i>Pre Islamic Arabian civilisation
was largely an oral culture

71
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:05,006
<i>and there was tremendous respect
and admiration

72
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,397
<i>for people who could
express themselves orally,

73
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:11,917
<i>especially those who could recite
poetry almost at the drop of a hat.

74
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,164
<i>Some of the most important people
in a tribe were the poets.

75
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:20,765
<i>They sang of the glory of the tribe.
They told the story of the tribe.

76
00:07:23,705 --> 00:07:27,505
To the Bedouin,
the word had a mystical importance.

77
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:34,759
Poets linked the tribe to its ancestors
and celebrated values older than memory.

78
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:39,795
Poetry was the sinew
that bound the Bedouin together,

79
00:07:39,796 --> 00:07:43,796
celebrating their victories,
lamenting their defeats.

80
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:47,925
<i>The poems themselves,
like the poems of Homer,

81
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:50,964
<i>both celebrate
this great heroic ethos

82
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:54,523
<i>and yet intimate,
in the deepest way,

83
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:57,424
<i>the tragedy that, um...

84
00:07:57,425 --> 00:08:02,505
<i>this war... this ethos of constant
tribal warfare brings to people.

85
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:10,205
Warfare and conflict were
the grim realities of a dangerous time.

86
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:15,636
Muhammad's uncle taught him
the skills he'd need to survive

87
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:19,806
in a world where even a prophet
would wield a bow and arrow.

88
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:30,681
In a wilderness punished by the elements
and bereft of water,

89
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:35,682
rivalry over a single well could
provoke a blood feud for generations.

90
00:08:38,127 --> 00:08:42,598
<i>A real rivalry. Real battles,
and sometimes quite bloody.

91
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,125
<i>So the allegiance of individuals
was the family, immidiately,

92
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,482
<i>and, a larger extent, to the tribe.

93
00:08:52,647 --> 00:08:57,038
Without the tribe's protection,
no one could endure.

94
00:08:57,247 --> 00:09:00,239
<i>Scattered across the peninsula
were countless factions,

95
00:09:00,447 --> 00:09:02,881
all embroiled in bitter struggles,

96
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:06,045
each defending its precious
grazing lands, trade routes

97
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,946
and most importantly, its wells.

98
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:14,804
<i>You have to understand
that most of the lands are dry.

99
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:19,805
<i>So, water is something that
everyone always considers precious.

100
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,401
<i>For those of us in climates
that are more heavily watered

101
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:34,797
<i>it's difficult to understand the depth
and the centrality of the symbol of water

102
00:09:34,798 --> 00:09:37,898
<i>in societies that are desert

103
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:41,899
<i>and in which it only rains
once or twice a year

104
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,500
<i>and in which a little water makes
the difference between life and death.

105
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:55,366
Each clan had its own separate
gods and totems.

106
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:58,999
To water and wind,
fire and night.

107
00:10:00,953 --> 00:10:03,885
They were kept
in the caravan town of Mecca,

108
00:10:03,887 --> 00:10:07,163
in a shrine of wood,
stone and cloth.

109
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:11,485
It was called the Kaaba,
the Arabic word for 'cube'.

110
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:15,405
<i>Pre Islamic Arabs
worshipped a number of spirits.

111
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:20,600
<i>They were generally nature-oriented spirits
sometimes associated with natural features.

112
00:10:20,607 --> 00:10:23,326
<i>Like trees or rocks or springs.

113
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:29,639
<i>And the Kaaba in Mecca was
one of a number of these sanctuaries

114
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,640
<i>centred around
a particular cluster of deities.

115
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:37,642
It was said the Hebrew patriarch
Abraham himself

116
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:40,566
built the Kaaba centuries before

117
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:46,067
and that a sacred black stone it held within
had fallen from the sky.

118
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:53,558
In these turbulent times,
the Kaaba provided a rare place of peace.

119
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:57,751
Only here would the Bedouin
submit to a temporary truce

120
00:10:58,087 --> 00:11:01,841
before returning to their conflicts
of the open sands.

121
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:07,524
<i>There was this one place
in the middle, around the Kaaba,

122
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:13,040
<i>which was, from even pre Islamic times,
a place of... a sacred enclosure

123
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:16,557
<i>where all people
had to put down their arms.

124
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:18,962
<i>This, of course, facilitated trading

125
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:26,364
<i>because it meant that you couldn't
carry on your feuds, when you
were doing your buying and selling

126
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:31,683
<i>The spiritual and economic
importance of the Kaaba and Mecca

127
00:11:31,684 --> 00:11:36,184
<i>are pretty hard to seperate as far
as the pre-Islamic Arabs are concerned.

128
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:42,362
The Kaaba made Mecca
a vibrant centre for trade.

129
00:11:43,407 --> 00:11:49,198
Here were found Arabian incense,
exotic perfumes and Indian spices,

130
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:52,205
Chinese silks and Egyptian linens.

131
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:57,960
But perhaps the greatest treasure
to be found at Mecca

132
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,920
was the rich mixture of cultures.

133
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,431
<i>They were people who came through town

134
00:12:06,432 --> 00:12:10,845
<i>who had all kinds of interesting
experiences to relate of faraway places.

135
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:14,476
<i>The local religion was mixed.
There were Christians, there were Jews.

136
00:12:14,477 --> 00:12:18,877
<i>There were also the Arabs of the desert
who followed an animist type of religion.

137
00:12:22,687 --> 00:12:25,485
Muhammad's world was a centre of trade,

138
00:12:25,486 --> 00:12:28,986
connecting the Mediterranean Sea
to the Indian Ocean,

139
00:12:28,987 --> 00:12:32,587
linking the ageing empires
of Byztantium and Persia

140
00:12:32,588 --> 00:12:35,888
to the great bazaars
of India and China.

141
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:49,200
Muhammad became a merchant.

142
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:55,003
In fact,
he had a great flair for trade.

143
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:00,838
At the age of 25, while leading
a caravan northward to Syria,

144
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,739
his talents caught the eye
of the shipment's owner,

145
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:08,163
a wealth widow named Khadijah.

146
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:13,598
She was so taken with Muhammad,
she proposed marriage.

147
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:18,764
<i>Ah, Khadijah. Well, I think
she was a mentor as well as a wife.

148
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:22,562
<i>A very strong lady
who had her own business

149
00:13:22,563 --> 00:13:25,363
<i>and Muhammad was helping her out.

150
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:29,121
<i>So, it was a wonderful partnership
and I'm sure he learned a lot from her.

151
00:13:30,847 --> 00:13:33,805
<i>He had a tremendous amount of contact

152
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:37,317
<i>with merchants coming from
different parts of the world,

153
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:41,218
<i>passing through the Arabian peninsula.

154
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:47,003
<i>I think he was a very intelligent man,
very open minded,

155
00:13:47,207 --> 00:13:51,644
<i>and he was able to communicate
with a great variety of people.

156
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:54,805
<i>He must have had
great charisma as well.

157
00:13:56,034 --> 00:14:00,500
Muhammad had a way with people,
and with resolving their disputes.

158
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,640
Once, when the Kaaba
fell into disrepair,

159
00:14:05,641 --> 00:14:09,205
the clan chieftains quarrelled
over who would have the honour

160
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:12,836
of putting the sacred black stone
back where it belonged.

161
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:20,492
Before violence could erupt,
Muhammad proposed an equitable solution.

162
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:32,085
United in the effort,
the four leaders shared the weight...

163
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:34,243
and the honour.

164
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:42,703
In gratitude, they invited Muhammad himself
to replace the secret stone.

165
00:14:43,993 --> 00:14:48,593
He became known as Al Amin,
'The Trusted One'.

166
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:51,084
<i>There are all kinds of indications

167
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:54,484
<i>that he was tremendously interested
in religious questions.

168
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:56,359
<i>This is obviously not something

169
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:59,479
<i>that an ordinary person probably
was interested in in those days.

170
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,380
<i>He talked to...
sages, Arab sages.

171
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:08,918
<i>He talked to Jewish and Christian sages
who lived in the area.

172
00:15:10,402 --> 00:15:13,323
<i>He used to go up
into the rock hills around Mecca

173
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:16,000
<i>and meditate, think about things.

174
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:20,237
<i>And at some point
he had this extraordinary vision

175
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:24,679
<i>which is spoken about
very evocatively and allusively.

176
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:32,317
In a cave above Mecca,

177
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:37,726
Muhammad had an experience that would
be the defining moment of his life.

178
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:45,557
An angel was said to appear before him
in the form of a man,

179
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:49,959
instructing him to recite
in the name of God, the Almighty.

180
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:57,437
For Muhammad, it was an encounter
as profound as it was deeply disturbing.

181
00:15:57,438 --> 00:16:01,480
<i>You get a sense
of what it would be like

182
00:16:01,487 --> 00:16:04,763
<i>to be a normal person in society...

183
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:08,920
<i>perhaps unusual in the sense
of your intensity for things

184
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:12,681
<i>like social justice and finding out
what the meaning of life is,

185
00:16:12,682 --> 00:16:18,982
<i>but not being endowed with anything
that would seem miraculous by your friends.

186
00:16:19,877 --> 00:16:24,577
<i>And all of a sudden
having this voice come to you

187
00:16:24,578 --> 00:16:29,808
<i>and then come OUT of you as you speak it
and recite it to other people.

188
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:38,638
<i>And that is the beginning
of the prophetic career of Muhammad.

189
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:48,725
The months to come
would bring more revelations...

190
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:53,061
powerful words of a lyrical quality,

191
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:57,485
more beautiful than
the most exquisite Arabic poetry.

192
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:05,195
Above all, Muhammad was to bear
one message to his people,

193
00:17:05,196 --> 00:17:08,796
a simple yet radical proclamation.

194
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:12,925
That there is only one God.

195
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:19,043
<i>The central tenet of Islam is the oneness,
the indivisible unity of God.

196
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:23,843
<i>Not something that is simply...
that one pays lip service to

197
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,926
<i>but something that is absolutely
the most important concept.

198
00:17:28,127 --> 00:17:31,164
<i>Divine unity is more
than saying there's only one God

199
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:33,278
<i>and there are no other deities.

200
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:36,445
<i>It's only thinking about one thing.

201
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:39,957
<i>So, to be thinking about possessions,
to be thinking about status,

202
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:42,158
<i>to be thinking about power,

203
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:44,676
<i>are all intellectual idols.

204
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:52,840
The implications were staggering.

205
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:55,841
One God meant one people.

206
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:59,958
No more tribal divisions.

207
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:05,002
To the poor and unprotected,
the prospect was revolutionary.

208
00:18:06,607 --> 00:18:09,405
<i>Seems to me that
one of the most important things

209
00:18:09,607 --> 00:18:12,644
<i>in his early teaching
that isn't often talked about

210
00:18:12,847 --> 00:18:16,442
<i>is the strong social justice message
that he delivered.

211
00:18:17,647 --> 00:18:19,603
<i>In Mecca at the time

212
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:23,197
<i>there was an increasing separation
between the haves and the have nots.

213
00:18:23,198 --> 00:18:26,840
<i>He insisted that this was not to be
and that we should share the wealth.

214
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:29,600
<i>It was this social justice
message that, i think,

215
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:32,286
<i>really got him a hearing
among many of the folks.

216
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:36,878
<i>So coming with Islam
it was a new order, a new way of life,

217
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:38,800
<i>and it was a beautiful way of life

218
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:43,160
<i>because everybody was equal...
black, white, men, women, children.

219
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:46,796
<i>So it had that type
of universal appeal

220
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:50,522
<i>which I think was the reason
why Islam spread so rapidly.

221
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,680
Many were moved
by Muhammad's message

222
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:57,845
as he began to speak out
in the community.

223
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:05,445
<i>It had the suppleness and symbolic depth
of the great pre-Islamic poems

224
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:08,598
<i>that had been created by this people

225
00:19:08,807 --> 00:19:11,924
<i>and that had given
these people in Arabia

226
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:16,560
<i>such an Extraordinary ear
for verbal expression,

227
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:21,516
<i>where verbal expression
was the commanding cultural force.

228
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:24,403
<i>Some people called him a poet.

229
00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:28,680
<i>There's a Qur'anic sura
basically saying...

230
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,480
<i>Muhammad is not a poet.

231
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:34,921
<i>Poets speak through desire.

232
00:19:35,127 --> 00:19:39,006
<i>This is not the voice of desire,
this is the voice of God.

233
00:19:42,752 --> 00:19:45,000
Muhammad's following began to grow.

234
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:53,037
They called themselves 'Muslims',
for those who surrender to God.

235
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,522
They set out to preserve the message
Muhammad had brought.

236
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:02,436
This was the beginning of the Qur'an.

237
00:20:04,192 --> 00:20:06,165
<i>The Qur'an was revealed orally

238
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:09,045
<i>but very soon people realised
it had to be written down

239
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:12,080
<i>in order to make sure
it wasn't corrupted

240
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,647
<i>and the original message
was maintained.

241
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:21,796
<i>From a very early date, and it's
very unclear when that date was

242
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:24,840
<i>because no early manuscripts
of the Qur'an survive,

243
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:27,402
<i>people began copying it down.

244
00:20:31,367 --> 00:20:35,724
The Qur'an is a revelation
of spiritual teaching,

245
00:20:35,927 --> 00:20:39,442
of both ethical and social guidance.

246
00:20:39,647 --> 00:20:43,686
It was revealed, and remains,
in Arabic.

247
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:49,521
<i>What's so extraordinary
about the Qur'an is its naturalness,

248
00:20:49,727 --> 00:20:53,003
<i>so that it can say
the most powerful cosmic things

249
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:56,005
<i>with a sense of intimacy,

250
00:20:56,006 --> 00:21:01,506
<i>so that power and tenderness come together
constanly in the Qur'anic language.

251
00:21:03,207 --> 00:21:07,883
With words alone, the Qur'an delivers
its vision to the faithful.

252
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:11,924
Its imagery conjures
a picture of the afterlife

253
00:21:12,127 --> 00:21:16,564
that resonates with all the power
of traditional Bedouin poetry.

254
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:21,880
<i>Imagine yourself in the desert...

255
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:27,575
<i>surrounded by dust,
by the glare of the sun.

256
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:29,802
<i>You wear cloaks to cover your body

257
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:33,720
<i>because the wind will just
sear your skin right off your face.

258
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:38,165
<i>And you walk into an oasis.

259
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:42,755
<i>The temperature drops dramatically.

260
00:21:44,237 --> 00:21:48,807
<i>There's a quiet there.
The wind is no longer howling.

261
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:52,686
<i>Everywhere you look
you see green and colour.

262
00:21:53,068 --> 00:21:59,380
<i>The world of water and paradise
are symbolically tied to one another.

263
00:22:00,238 --> 00:22:06,238
<i>And the Qur'an can conjure that up
with just a few briefly chosen words.

264
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,645
Yet for all the imagery of paradise
in the Qur'an,

265
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:21,605
there was no easy description of God.

266
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:23,606
The mystery would remain.

267
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:30,159
<i>It's very difficult to talk about God
without reifying God,

268
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,885
<i>reifying to make God into a thing,

269
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:34,684
<i>or anthropomorphising God,

270
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:38,880
<i>to make God into a projection
of our own human self.

271
00:22:38,881 --> 00:22:43,607
<i>That's why Muslims don't like sculpture,
for example, traditionally,

272
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:46,167
<i>because they believe
there's that danger.

273
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:50,076
<i>The Qur'an avoids that
by constantly shifting the pronouns

274
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:55,441
<i>so we can't really reify God and get
an image, a physical image of God.

275
00:22:58,367 --> 00:23:02,042
Rather than a physical image of God,
or of Muhammad,

276
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:07,446
it is the beauty of the Qur'an itself
that is celebrated in Islam.

277
00:23:08,047 --> 00:23:14,520
<i>Islam developed in this context
where pictures were not favoured.

278
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:19,801
<i>The Qur'an as it was revealed
was God's representation on earth.

279
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:23,044
<i>And Muslims felt
from a very early time

280
00:23:23,247 --> 00:23:28,116
<i>that the only just representation
of God's word was the Qur'an itself,

281
00:23:28,327 --> 00:23:33,685
<i>not any picture of... God, certainly not,
because you couldn't represent God,

282
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:37,686
<i>and certainly not a picture of Muhammad,
because he wasn't divine.

283
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:49,880
<i>At certain times and places people did
make images of the Prophet Muhammad.

284
00:23:50,087 --> 00:23:52,078
<i>But these are not religious images,

285
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:54,915
<i>these are not images
meant to be worshipped,

286
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:58,365
<i>they are not images
of a saint or of God.

287
00:23:58,367 --> 00:24:01,677
<i>They're images of Muhammad
as a historical figure.

288
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:07,924
<i>He's sort of given honour by having
a very bright blue background

289
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:10,083
<i>or a white cloud near him

290
00:24:10,287 --> 00:24:14,678
<i>but he's not otherwise distinguished
from the other characters in the story.

291
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:17,924
<i>At other times
people did represent the Prophet

292
00:24:18,127 --> 00:24:21,722
<i>but always with a white cloth
over his face, to hide his face.

293
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:25,124
<i>So there were different
approaches to doing this.

294
00:24:27,247 --> 00:24:30,319
<i>But in all of these,
these are not devotional images.

295
00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:33,485
<i>You're not supposed to look at them
and pray towards them.

296
00:24:33,486 --> 00:24:36,405
<i>You're to learn more about
the history of your religion,

297
00:24:36,406 --> 00:24:39,006
<i>with the emphasis on history,
from them.

298
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:44,765
As Muhammad's community grew,

299
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:47,162
so did the opposition.

300
00:24:48,127 --> 00:24:50,243
<i>People, of course, were sceptical

301
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:55,043
<i>and said "Look, if you're a prophet,
where's your miracle?"

302
00:24:55,247 --> 00:24:57,203
<i>"And the prophets
in the Qur'an...

303
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:01,504
<i>"Moses had miracles,
Jesus had miracles.

304
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,523
<i>"Where's your miracle?"

305
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:07,686
<i>And the Qur'anic answer
to that challenge is...

306
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:11,597
<i>"This is the miracle...
this Qur'an.'

307
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:16,844
But that wasn't miracle enough

308
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:20,562
for the people who defined themselves
by the gods of their ancestors

309
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:22,917
and the totems of their tribe.

310
00:25:23,807 --> 00:25:26,082
Their doubts increased.

311
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:30,402
The idea of life after death
appalled them.

312
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:36,203
<i>So, the Qur'an presents people
as really being sceptical.

313
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:39,120
<i>"You mean to tell me that after I die

314
00:25:39,327 --> 00:25:44,276
<i>"and my body has gone back
to the elements and I've been putrefied

315
00:25:44,487 --> 00:25:47,240
<i>"that I'm going to be
put back together again

316
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:49,199
<i>"and brought back to life?"

317
00:25:49,407 --> 00:25:52,285
<i>That, of any of the messages
in the Qur'an,

318
00:25:52,487 --> 00:25:56,321
<i>that struck the people of Arabia
as being the most hard to believe.

319
00:25:58,247 --> 00:26:02,798
Muhammad also spoke
of eternal damnation for the unjust.

320
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:06,365
<i>He used the language
of apocalyptic imagery,

321
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:09,885
<i>talking about
the signs of the end of time...

322
00:26:09,887 --> 00:26:13,675
<i>when the mountains crumble,
when the skies are rolled up like scrolls,

323
00:26:13,887 --> 00:26:18,961
<i>then you will know what responsibility
you bear for your actions.

324
00:26:18,962 --> 00:26:25,962
<i>There are references to those
who are unjust going to the fire.

325
00:26:27,847 --> 00:26:29,724
To the non believers,

326
00:26:29,927 --> 00:26:33,840
the divine reckoning Muhammad invoked
was an outrage...

327
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:39,620
His dismantling of their heritage
and customs, deeply unsettling.

328
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:44,514
<i>It was a threat, in several ways...

329
00:26:44,527 --> 00:26:47,200
<i>to their social order,
to their age old traditions

330
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:49,921
<i>and an economic threat
because of the importance

331
00:26:50,127 --> 00:26:52,766
<i>of the pilgrimage shrine
of the Kaaba in Mecca.

332
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:58,717
As Muhammad's following increased,

333
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:02,806
the social fabric of the caravan city
began to unravel.

334
00:27:04,127 --> 00:27:09,884
Business suffered as pilgrims and traders,
worried for their safety, left town.

335
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:13,444
The tribal leaders decided

336
00:27:13,647 --> 00:27:19,517
Muhammad and his message
must be removed, permanently.

337
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:26,012
<i>They didn't want him taking over and
horning in on their control of the city.

338
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:30,086
<i>They made things very difficult for him,
perhaps even plotted his assassination.

339
00:27:30,087 --> 00:27:34,587
<i>They tried to keep him from the Kaaba,
doing all they could to run him out of town.

340
00:27:37,687 --> 00:27:42,807
They demanded Muhammad's uncle remove
his clan's protection from the Prophet...

341
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:47,957
which would clear the way for his murder
without the threat of retribution.

342
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:54,240
But his uncle refused.

343
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:57,281
The battle lines were drawn.

344
00:27:57,887 --> 00:28:02,005
Nothing short of tribal war
would settle the conflict now.

345
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:08,403
<i>Muhammad is clearly asked to do
extraordinary things...

346
00:28:08,404 --> 00:28:14,604
<i>to tell the Bedouin to give up
many of their notions of multiple gods,

347
00:28:14,607 --> 00:28:17,360
<i>to give up their attachment
to their ancestors

348
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:20,361
<i>and their tribal warfare
in the way they had.

349
00:28:20,362 --> 00:28:27,362
<i>Things that... could and did make him
the object of scorn, persecution

350
00:28:27,927 --> 00:28:29,883
<i>and, um... attack.

351
00:28:35,355 --> 00:28:39,400
Muhammad's followers were forced
from the marketplace and starved.

352
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:46,597
Those without clan protection
were tortured and killed.

353
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:56,838
In 619 AD,
Muhammad's wife Khadijah died...

354
00:28:57,047 --> 00:28:59,436
and his uncle as well.

355
00:29:00,007 --> 00:29:05,877
Gone were his first great love
and his only protector.

356
00:29:07,127 --> 00:29:12,281
Here at last was the opportunity
his enemies had been waiting for.

357
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,999
But in the lush oasis town
of Yathrib, north of Mecca,

358
00:29:20,447 --> 00:29:23,996
a refuge opened
to Muhammad and his people.

359
00:29:24,727 --> 00:29:27,878
Clan rivalries had become
deadly in the town

360
00:29:28,087 --> 00:29:31,318
and they desperately needed
a peacemaker.

361
00:29:31,727 --> 00:29:34,560
<i>They had heard that Muhammad
was a very trustworthy man.

362
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:38,405
<i>They'd heard he had great arbitration
skills, and they thought...

363
00:29:38,407 --> 00:29:41,080
<i>"Let's get him here to help out."
So they invited him.

364
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:52,923
Muhammad agreed to travel to Yathrib
and settle their disputes

365
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:56,004
in exchange for a safe refuge
for his people.

366
00:30:00,727 --> 00:30:02,524
For Muhammad's followers,

367
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:06,515
leaving the place of their ancestors,
their families and tribes

368
00:30:06,727 --> 00:30:09,480
was the ultimate test of devotion.

369
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:20,723
In doing so, they began
a new community, a new tribe.

370
00:30:23,727 --> 00:30:26,924
For the first time, they were
bound together not by blood,

371
00:30:27,127 --> 00:30:29,357
but by faith.

372
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:37,365
In the course
of a single caravan journey,

373
00:30:37,567 --> 00:30:41,003
Islam marks its true beginnings.

374
00:30:42,378 --> 00:30:45,878
Their journey is known as the Hijrah.

375
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:54,276
622 in the Christian calendar
marks the Muslim Year 1.

376
00:31:00,855 --> 00:31:03,725
Muhammad's goal
among the people of Yathrib

377
00:31:03,847 --> 00:31:06,315
was the same as his larger mission...

378
00:31:06,316 --> 00:31:08,999
to bring unity and peace
with his message...

379
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:13,000
<i>He was asked to be
a Solomonic figure,

380
00:31:13,346 --> 00:31:18,699
<i>to mediate tensions between tribes
that seemed intractable.

381
00:31:20,687 --> 00:31:22,564
As his work succeeded,

382
00:31:22,565 --> 00:31:26,800
the town would become known
as the City of the Prophet...

383
00:31:26,847 --> 00:31:28,758
Medina.

384
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:30,798
<i>Muhammad's great task in Medina

385
00:31:31,007 --> 00:31:34,079
<i>was to try and bring together
these various groups,

386
00:31:34,287 --> 00:31:38,200
<i>to try and forge
a community of believers

387
00:31:38,407 --> 00:31:42,923
<i>in a way that would bring people
together in a sort of harmony.

388
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:52,001
To the divided clans of Medina,
Muhammad offered a vision of solidarity.

389
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,008
But even as he spread
the word of Islam,

390
00:31:56,367 --> 00:31:59,803
he didn't challenge
the beliefs of other faiths.

391
00:32:01,247 --> 00:32:03,602
<i>Islam sees itself in relatlonship,

392
00:32:03,807 --> 00:32:07,880
<i>to the earlier revealed religions
of Judaism and Christianity

393
00:32:08,087 --> 00:32:11,397
<i>and treats them as people of the Book.

394
00:32:13,127 --> 00:32:19,919
<i>It believes that God had revealed himself,
his word, to mankind many times...

395
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,525
<i>to Moses, to Jesus,
for example, and...

396
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:25,643
<i>but each time
people went astray.

397
00:32:28,482 --> 00:32:32,640
<i>Throughout the Qur'an we have
a sense of the humanity of Muhammad,

398
00:32:32,647 --> 00:32:34,842
<i>his humbleness as a person

399
00:32:35,047 --> 00:32:38,642
<i>and the extraordinary challenge

400
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:42,806
<i>of the mission he was given
by this divine revelation.

401
00:32:48,186 --> 00:32:51,186
As the Muslim community grew
in Medina,

402
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:54,687
a life of simple devotion
and ritual developed.

403
00:32:56,007 --> 00:33:00,478
A freed Abyssinian slave,
named Bilal,

404
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:04,805
was the first to call believers
to prayer at Muhammad's house.

405
00:33:05,007 --> 00:33:07,919
<i>Allahu akbar.

406
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,810
It was the first mosque.

407
00:33:22,607 --> 00:33:27,965
<i>The call to prayer has within it
the first Islamic Pillar

408
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:30,727
<i>which is the affirmation
of God's unity...

409
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:32,918
<i>"La ilaha illa Allah"...

410
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:36,085
<i>that beautiful phrase
which many Muslims chant

411
00:33:36,087 --> 00:33:38,282
<i>over and over in their mind,
or vocally,

412
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:42,403
<i>to constantly remind themselves
of the unity of the God.

413
00:33:42,407 --> 00:33:45,922
<i>And the unity of what
we should focus on in our life.

414
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,402
<i>Allahu akbar.
La ilah illa Allah...

415
00:33:58,847 --> 00:34:02,396
<i>Praying together is a good thing.

416
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:06,197
<i>It cements the idea of belonging
to a movement, to a religion,

417
00:34:06,407 --> 00:34:09,080
<i>to an organisation, to a community.

418
00:34:12,447 --> 00:34:17,396
<i>The result is something
very, very powerful even to watch,

419
00:34:17,607 --> 00:34:20,599
<i>even for a non believer
or someone from another religion.

420
00:34:20,807 --> 00:34:24,959
<i>We carry out physical
gestures of prayer, in worship,

421
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:30,036
<i>that unify our body
and our mind and our soul,

422
00:34:30,247 --> 00:34:35,275
<i>all at the same moment of bowing
and touching our head to the ground

423
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:37,603
<i>toward that exact centre.

424
00:34:37,604 --> 00:34:40,604
<i>What could be
a more powerful symbol of unity?

425
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:49,237
It's said that, while he was in Medina,
Muhammad received a revelation,

426
00:34:49,527 --> 00:34:55,284
instructing those in prayer to face
in the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca.

427
00:34:57,087 --> 00:35:01,558
Though filled with pagan idols,
it was still the shrine of Abraham,

428
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:05,559
the first believer
in the one true God.

429
00:35:09,247 --> 00:35:12,398
But even as the Muslims
were praying toward Mecca,

430
00:35:12,607 --> 00:35:15,440
their enemies there
were rallying in force.

431
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:19,083
Their goal...
to wipe out the Muslims.

432
00:35:27,207 --> 00:35:30,199
Muhammad 's people
began to gather arms.

433
00:35:36,647 --> 00:35:39,605
Though the Muslims prepared
as best they could,

434
00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:42,401
they were outnumbered
and outmatched.

435
00:35:44,244 --> 00:35:47,100
They mustered a force of only 313,

436
00:35:47,727 --> 00:35:51,845
mostly old men and boys,
with few weapons...

437
00:35:53,663 --> 00:35:58,863
while the approaching Meccans were
heavily armed and a thousand strong.

438
00:36:04,087 --> 00:36:09,002
For years, Muhammad had tried to bring
Islam to the people of Mecca peacefully.

439
00:36:09,207 --> 00:36:11,880
Now it was time to fight.

440
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:32,286
Muslims faced their own tribes,

441
00:36:32,487 --> 00:36:36,844
brother fighting brother,
son against father.

442
00:36:41,127 --> 00:36:44,802
Yet they came armed
with a powerful weapon...

443
00:36:45,007 --> 00:36:48,283
a passionate belief in their faith...

444
00:36:49,727 --> 00:36:52,321
Muhammad's troops fought
with every confidence

445
00:36:52,527 --> 00:36:54,916
that God's will was guiding them.

446
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:04,604
<i>They fought three
very, very bloody battles.

447
00:37:04,605 --> 00:37:09,605
<i>At one point, the entire young Muslim
community was on the edge of annihilation.

448
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:22,839
For three years, the Muslim army
held out against staggering odds.

449
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:34,402
As word of the fighting spread,

450
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:39,477
other Bedouin tribes saw God's hand
in Muhammad's victories.

451
00:37:41,487 --> 00:37:45,765
One by one, the peoples of the desert
began to join in his struggle.

452
00:37:46,581 --> 00:37:50,981
The Muslim army grew
and tide began to turn.

453
00:38:00,226 --> 00:38:03,756
The Muslim forces advanced
to the outskirts of Mecca.

454
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:09,877
It was a furious siege
that lasted for nearly a month.

455
00:38:12,968 --> 00:38:17,250
Until, finally, the city
fell to Muhammad.

456
00:38:23,016 --> 00:38:29,016
In 630 AD, the terrified people
of Mecca braced for the onslaught.

457
00:38:31,687 --> 00:38:35,282
Muhammad's army was returning home,

458
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:38,160
now 10,000 strong...

459
00:38:47,087 --> 00:38:50,762
The vanquished knew the terrible fate
that awaited them.

460
00:38:52,407 --> 00:38:55,638
<i>According to the modes
of tribal warfare,

461
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:59,760
<i>the Meccans could expect
a big revenge.

462
00:38:59,967 --> 00:39:02,356
<i>The men are usually killed.

463
00:39:02,567 --> 00:39:05,525
<i>Women and children
are sold into slavery.

464
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:12,880
<i>There's little pity
for the loser in a tribal war.

465
00:39:16,007 --> 00:39:18,965
<i>Of course, that's standard
around the world.

466
00:39:23,047 --> 00:39:27,916
But Muhammad had a surprise in store
for the fallen city.

467
00:39:29,127 --> 00:39:30,958
<i>When Muhammad came into Mecca

468
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:34,239
<i>and not only did not carry out
a bloody revenge

469
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,700
<i>but actually embraced the very Meccans
who had fought him for three years

470
00:39:39,701 --> 00:39:41,761
<i>and attempted to annihilate him,

471
00:39:41,767 --> 00:39:44,918
<i>it was very shocking

472
00:39:45,127 --> 00:39:48,278
<i>to the people in his milieu.

473
00:39:49,407 --> 00:39:53,525
<i>So, within the very founding
of the religion

474
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:57,561
<i>one finds episodes
of great generosity...

475
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:03,562
<i>often extraordinary acts
of kindness and mercy.

476
00:40:06,287 --> 00:40:09,438
But not all of Mecca
escaped Muhammad's wrath.

477
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:16,758
Flush with victory, his troops
marched straight to the Kaaba.

478
00:40:19,007 --> 00:40:21,805
Seven times
they circled the shrine,

479
00:40:21,806 --> 00:40:25,806
as those who had come to seek
its protection appealed to their idols.

480
00:40:27,837 --> 00:40:31,837
But it was not the pagan people
Muhammad come to destroy.

481
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:34,443
It was their gods.

482
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,917
He raised his staff

483
00:40:39,127 --> 00:40:43,405
and the tribal gods of his ancestors
smashed into dust.

484
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:49,003
<i>When Muhammad entered Mecca
and entered the shrine,

485
00:40:49,207 --> 00:40:52,563
<i>and destroyed
the idols in the shrine,

486
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:57,443
<i>this is of great cultural
and symbolic importance in Islam.

487
00:40:59,127 --> 00:41:01,595
<i>By breaking the idols,

488
00:41:01,596 --> 00:41:06,796
<i>he was breaking apart
the tribal system

489
00:41:06,807 --> 00:41:12,484
<i>in which each tribe really had
its own independent deity.

490
00:41:14,129 --> 00:41:16,645
<i>This was schocking to the Bedouin.

491
00:41:16,647 --> 00:41:20,526
<i>This was saying, the gods
of our fathers are being destroyed.

492
00:41:20,527 --> 00:41:25,687
<i>In some sense, you are saying that
our fathers themselves were deluded.

493
00:41:25,722 --> 00:41:27,803
<i>How can you say this in a tradition

494
00:41:27,804 --> 00:41:32,404
<i>in which relationships
to one's father and tribe were primary?

495
00:41:32,447 --> 00:41:35,598
<i>So, this act of iconoclasm, then,

496
00:41:35,807 --> 00:41:41,165
<i>is seen as an act
of prophetic violence

497
00:41:41,367 --> 00:41:45,121
<i>that has just as much importance
in Islamic tradition

498
00:41:45,327 --> 00:41:51,641
<i>as Moses's breaking of the tablets
when he saw the idolatry at Mt Sinai

499
00:41:51,847 --> 00:41:57,399
<i>or Jesus's casting of the money sellers
out of the Temple.

500
00:42:57,819 --> 00:43:00,538
The Muslims turned to the north,

501
00:43:09,899 --> 00:43:14,575
They continued west, into Egypt,
and quickly across North Africa,

502
00:43:14,779 --> 00:43:17,771
fortifying the coastline
of the Mediterranean.

503
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:21,999
Only the seas stopped them.

504
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:25,773
<i>Its growth was so explosive

505
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:31,656
<i>from 622, Year 1
of the Islamic calendar.

506
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,488
<i>Within 50 years,

507
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:39,692
<i>people whose fathers
had been camel herders

508
00:43:39,899 --> 00:43:43,096
<i>were now governing
one of the major empires in world history.

509
00:43:44,299 --> 00:43:49,327
<i>Within 200 years
it extended from Spain to China.

510
00:43:52,314 --> 00:43:56,814
The Muslims absorbed
the Sasanian Empire of Iran

511
00:43:56,819 --> 00:44:00,368
and two thirds
of the Christian Byzantine Empire.

512
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:05,159
By now the empire was larger than Rome.

513
00:44:06,699 --> 00:44:09,532
It stretched from Morocco in the west

514
00:44:09,533 --> 00:44:14,533
to the Indus River in the east,
where the border of India is today.

515
00:44:20,499 --> 00:44:22,376
How had it happened,

516
00:44:22,377 --> 00:44:28,877
that so small an army could conquer
an area so large, so fast, so easily?

517
00:44:32,906 --> 00:44:36,500
<i>Islam's success in expanding
into the central Middle East

518
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:38,655
<i>then across North Africa

519
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:41,089
<i>was due in large part

520
00:44:41,299 --> 00:44:44,177
<i>because people were fed up
with previous regimes.

521
00:44:44,178 --> 00:44:50,330
<i>So the idea that Muslims were going across
the world saying that "Convert or Die"

522
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:53,012
<i>is really not accurate, not at all.

523
00:44:54,019 --> 00:44:57,694
<i>They didn't have a heavy hand,
they didn't rule with a heavy hand.

524
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:03,695
<i>They allowed the conquered people
to maintain their administrative structures.

525
00:45:03,696 --> 00:45:07,858
<i>They allowed the Christians and the Jews
to maintain their religious law

526
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:09,770
<i>and to be governed by them.

527
00:45:09,979 --> 00:45:13,415
<i>And so, in many cases,
conquered peoples did not feel

528
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:16,895
<i>the presence of the new regime
very heavily.

529
00:45:16,896 --> 00:45:23,130
<i>Certainly for individuals who felt
themselves exploited or downtrodden

530
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:26,336
<i>by an oppressive and even
sometimes parasitic priesthood,

531
00:45:26,539 --> 00:45:30,088
<i>the idea of Islam being a religion
essentially free from clergy

532
00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:32,289
<i>must have seemed very attractive.

533
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:40,008
<i>It's the times that create
the movement and sometimes the men.

534
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:42,096
<i>The Roman Empire had collapsed.

535
00:45:42,299 --> 00:45:44,859
<i>The Byzantine Empire
wasn't strong enough.

536
00:45:45,259 --> 00:45:50,617
<i>There was a need for a new vision,
a new way of looking to life

537
00:45:50,618 --> 00:45:53,518
<i>and i think what happened
at that time,

538
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:58,370
<i>Muhammad's mission filled the void
that the societies wanted.

539
00:45:58,379 --> 00:46:02,213
<i>They really wanted some sort
of solidarity in their lives.

540
00:46:04,339 --> 00:46:06,295
The lessons of the Qur'an,

541
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:09,596
so successful for the Muslims
in Medina and Mecca,

542
00:46:09,597 --> 00:46:12,500
were playing out on a global scale.

543
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:19,458
As the conquest swept through Syria,

544
00:46:19,459 --> 00:46:22,064
the Muslims held their friday prayers

545
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:25,216
in the church of St John the Baptist
in Damascus...

546
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:31,570
allowing its Christian congregation
to continue their services on Sunday.

547
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:42,280
Side by side, the two faiths shared
the same building, in peace.

548
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:50,935
As the Muslim community grew,

549
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:54,176
they bought the old church
from the Christian congregation

550
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:56,893
and built a huge mosque on the site.

551
00:47:05,269 --> 00:47:11,269
With Byzantine artisans, they decorated it
with golden mosaics of an Islamic paradise.

552
00:47:16,988 --> 00:47:22,218
The Great Mosque of Damascus would
become a model for new mosques to come,

553
00:47:22,219 --> 00:47:24,369
all across the empire.

554
00:47:30,859 --> 00:47:34,135
The Arabs transformed
their conquered lands,

555
00:47:34,339 --> 00:47:38,014
maintaining, improving
or expanding the infrastructure.

556
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:44,891
In Tunisia,
building on Roman ruins,

557
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:48,569
they devised an ingenious system
of water purification,

558
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:51,999
using gravity to separate
fresh water from sediments.

559
00:47:54,426 --> 00:47:58,126
<i>Part of this system
were these two enormous basins

560
00:47:58,139 --> 00:48:01,017
<i>that they built
outside the city walls.

561
00:48:02,979 --> 00:48:08,690
<i>The clean fresh water
would flow over into the larger basin

562
00:48:08,691 --> 00:48:13,400
<i>where it would then be distributed
by pipes to the city.

563
00:48:13,419 --> 00:48:16,252
<i>This is, you know,
hundreds of years before

564
00:48:16,459 --> 00:48:19,337
<i>anyone in Europe ever thought
of having running water.

565
00:48:30,499 --> 00:48:34,048
<i>All over you find schemes
for bringing water from the mountains,

566
00:48:34,049 --> 00:48:35,749
<i>where there was more water,

567
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,990
<i>to the plains,
where there might be less water.

568
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:45,091
They resurrected
elaborate irrigation systems,

569
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:48,892
filling the old stone aqueducts
with precious water.

570
00:48:53,699 --> 00:48:55,371
Agriculture flourished

571
00:48:55,372 --> 00:48:59,400
as life-giving staples like wheat were
introduced to the Mediterranean region.

572
00:50:41,135 --> 00:50:43,251
In just 100 years,

573
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:48,890
Muhammad's vision had transformed
the spiritual and political map of the world

574
00:50:48,895 --> 00:50:53,571
and his followers had established
an empire larger than Rome.

575
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:59,130
But Muhammad
never lived to see it.

576
00:51:02,215 --> 00:51:05,525
In the 11th year
of the Islamic calendar,

577
00:51:05,735 --> 00:51:11,685
632 AD, only two years
after the taking of Mecca,

578
00:51:11,895 --> 00:51:14,386
Muhammad died.

579
00:51:18,895 --> 00:51:21,329
Medina fell into despair.

580
00:51:24,335 --> 00:51:29,045
For days, the city was consumed
with sorrow and ceremony.

581
00:51:29,775 --> 00:51:33,006
<i>He's known to have said that
he wanted to be buried very simply

582
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,046
<i>with no marker over his grave.

583
00:51:35,255 --> 00:51:37,974
<i>He didn't want people
to worship his grave.

584
00:51:37,975 --> 00:51:40,275
<i>That would interfere
with their worship of God.

585
00:51:41,576 --> 00:51:45,494
God had spoken to them
only through Muhammad.

586
00:51:45,495 --> 00:51:50,046
Now that the Prophet had left them,
perhaps God would as well.

587
00:51:51,295 --> 00:51:55,766
<i>Muhammad's death set up a crisis
in the young Islamic community.

588
00:51:55,767 --> 00:52:00,550
<i>The question of succession was the first
thing that really occupied people's concerns.

589
00:52:00,551 --> 00:52:03,451
<i>At this point there was
a divergence of opinion as to how

590
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:06,572
<i>the community should
go about choosing a new leader.

591
00:52:06,775 --> 00:52:10,324
<i>According to the Shi'ites,
a faction, the Shi'a of Ali,

592
00:52:10,325 --> 00:52:16,725
<i>Muhammad had indeed designated Ali
his son-in-law and cousin, as his successor.

593
00:52:17,055 --> 00:52:20,764
<i>The opinion that came to be
the majority, or Sunni opinion

594
00:52:20,765 --> 00:52:25,334
<i>held that Muhammad had not appointed
a successor during his life

595
00:52:25,335 --> 00:52:29,374
<i>but had said "After I am gone,
choose one from among your peers,

596
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:30,975
<i>from among the elders."

597
00:52:32,535 --> 00:52:38,132
<i>And from the house there came out a man
who would be his successor, Abu Bakr.

598
00:52:38,935 --> 00:52:41,449
<i>And he addressed the people
and said...

599
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:44,714
"If you worship Muhammad, know
that he is dead"

600
00:52:44,715 --> 00:52:47,813
<i>"If you worship God, know
that he lives forever. "

601
00:52:49,756 --> 00:52:54,956
Here was the secret to Islam's strength
and profound influence...

602
00:52:55,575 --> 00:53:01,047
the unifying power of one God,
merciful and compassionate,

603
00:53:01,255 --> 00:53:05,612
the power of one people,
bound by a common faith.

604
00:53:07,927 --> 00:53:12,927
Muhammad did not lead the
conquest of create the empire to come

605
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:17,530
The transforming power
of his message did.

606
00:53:20,907 --> 00:53:24,570
Out of that message would spring
a font of knowledge

607
00:53:24,575 --> 00:53:27,408
that would transform humanity,

608
00:53:27,409 --> 00:53:32,209
as Islam continued to spread
its reach far and wide.

609
00:53:34,455 --> 00:53:38,368
Awaiting the Muslims
would be a new age.

610
00:53:38,369 --> 00:53:42,814
They would be destined
for enlightenment, for new horizons,

611
00:53:42,815 --> 00:53:45,045
and a clash of great powers

612
00:53:45,046 --> 00:53:49,046
the like of which
the world have never seen...

613
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:56,694
During the 7th and 8th centuries AD,

614
00:53:56,695 --> 00:54:00,895
a powerful new faith
was about to change the world...

615
00:54:00,897 --> 00:54:03,047
the faith of Islam.

616
00:54:04,937 --> 00:54:08,168
Its followers launched a conquest
not only by the sword

617
00:54:08,169 --> 00:54:11,169
but with the power of ideas.

618
00:54:12,566 --> 00:54:14,895
Two hundred years after
the death of Muhammad

619
00:54:14,897 --> 00:54:20,449
his message, and the new Arab empire,
were transforming three continents.

620
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:29,627
<i>Now comes a new empire,
a political new configuration,

621
00:54:29,657 --> 00:54:34,685
<i>driven by a religious,
newly defined civilisation.

622
00:54:35,097 --> 00:54:36,849
<i>This new civilisation,

623
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:43,350
<i>expanding beyond its own dreams
within a period of very short time.

624
00:54:44,057 --> 00:54:48,096
<i>Literally, the largest empire
civilisation had ever known.

625
00:55:02,145 --> 00:55:05,895
The Arabic word for conquest, futuh,

626
00:55:05,897 --> 00:55:08,570
literally means 'openings'.

627
00:55:08,777 --> 00:55:12,247
Islam sowed the seeds of its faith
to the four winds

628
00:55:12,457 --> 00:55:15,608
and a world of opportunities
opened before it.

629
00:55:18,217 --> 00:55:22,574
But the vast empire's spiritual core
remained at its birthplace...

630
00:55:23,097 --> 00:55:25,657
the holy city of Mecca.

631
00:55:30,097 --> 00:55:32,895
From every corner
of the Muslim world

632
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:36,726
the faithful embarked
on the traditional journey to Mecca,

633
00:55:37,018 --> 00:55:40,268
<i>a sacred pilgrimage
known as the Hajj.

634
00:55:42,514 --> 00:55:47,856
<i>The pilgrimage became a central devotional
and ritual feature in Islamic life.

635
00:55:47,857 --> 00:55:50,291
<i>In fact, since the life
of Muhammad himself,

636
00:55:50,292 --> 00:55:51,792
<i>the pilgrimage
has symbolised,

637
00:55:51,793 --> 00:55:55,915
<i>probably more than
any other Islamic ritual activity,

638
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:59,293
<i>unity among all people
and equality.

639
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:09,315
The Hajj set humanity in motion.

640
00:56:10,017 --> 00:56:13,407
For the first time
since the reign of Alexander the Great,

641
00:56:13,408 --> 00:56:17,408
cultures and caravans now flowed freely.

642
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:22,109
Borders closed for a thousand years
opened...

643
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:26,820
<i>Both ideas and goods went
back and forth over incredible distances.

644
00:56:27,735 --> 00:56:31,056
<i>Since every Muslim is enjoined
once in his life to visit Mecca.

645
00:56:31,057 --> 00:56:34,572
<i>It means that there were caravans
carrying goods and pilgrims

646
00:56:34,777 --> 00:56:37,245
<i>and ideas and people.

647
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:40,616
<i>And they all met together
in Mecca once a year,

648
00:56:40,617 --> 00:56:42,812
<i>then things
would radiate back home.

649
00:56:43,017 --> 00:56:45,406
<i>So if an invention
was discovered in Samarkand

650
00:56:45,407 --> 00:56:48,914
<i>it could be, within the year,
known in Cordoba.

651
00:56:52,166 --> 00:56:56,085
Where pilgrims trod,
traders soon followed.

652
00:56:56,531 --> 00:56:59,255
Muhammad himself
had been a man of commerce

653
00:56:59,257 --> 00:57:01,691
and now the spread of his message

654
00:57:01,692 --> 00:57:05,692
brought with it the spread of trade
and the Islamic way of life.

655
00:57:07,193 --> 00:57:09,216
<i>Trade was incredibly important
in the Islamic world

656
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:11,173
<i>simply because
of its geographical position.

657
00:57:11,377 --> 00:57:14,175
<i>It was, and still is,
between what we call the West,

658
00:57:14,377 --> 00:57:17,175
<i>and what people
always called the East.

659
00:57:17,377 --> 00:57:21,131
<i>So it was a natural land bridge
connecting China to Europe.

660
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:30,406
In only two centuries,
Islam had extended its reach

661
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:33,893
from Spain
all the way to the edge of India.

662
00:57:36,377 --> 00:57:38,208
It took nearly a year

663
00:57:38,417 --> 00:57:41,966
to travel from one end
of the Arab empire to the other.

664
00:57:44,337 --> 00:57:48,012
At its heart was a fabled city of wealth.

665
00:57:48,857 --> 00:57:51,132
It was called Baghdad.

666
00:58:01,857 --> 00:58:06,009
The palaces of ancient Baghdad
have been lost over the centuries

667
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:12,015
but in its glory
it rivalled ancient Athens or Rome.

668
00:58:13,937 --> 00:58:17,566
It was a magnificent
architectural achievement,

669
00:58:17,777 --> 00:58:20,814
the pride of Islam in a new age.

670
00:58:24,297 --> 00:58:26,731
One visitor left this account.

671
00:58:30,024 --> 00:58:32,856
"All the exquisite neighbourhoods
covered with parks,

672
00:58:32,857 --> 00:58:36,327
"gardens, villas
and beautiful promenades

673
00:58:36,537 --> 00:58:40,815
"are filled with bazaars
and finely built mosques and baths.

674
00:58:42,217 --> 00:58:46,529
"They stretch for miles on both sides
of the glittering river."

675
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,735
But what made this
the greatest city of its time

676
00:58:53,937 --> 00:58:56,497
was more than just what met the eye.

677
00:58:56,697 --> 00:58:58,653
It was the company it kept.

678
00:58:58,654 --> 00:59:03,315
Scholars made Baghdad
the jewel of the world.

679
00:59:03,316 --> 00:59:05,175
<i>Certainly from the 8th century on,

680
00:59:05,177 --> 00:59:08,328
<i>Baghdad was the centre of learning
in the Islamic world

681
00:59:08,537 --> 00:59:13,372
<i>and all major innovations either came
from Baghdad or quickly came to Baghdad

682
00:59:14,529 --> 00:59:20,742
<i>Because the best people came
to Baghdad, the best thinkers,
the best philosophers, the best artists.

683
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:34,567
The empire's meteoric growth
had left its new leaders overwhelmed.

684
00:59:36,457 --> 00:59:40,769
They had staggering engineering
and logistical problems to contend with.

685
00:59:42,945 --> 00:59:46,945
Solving them would take
the greatest minds of the day.

686
00:59:47,537 --> 00:59:51,166
<i>Under the new empire now,
you're responsible for public hygiene,

687
00:59:51,246 --> 00:59:56,066
you're responsible for the marketplace,
for the goods being sold in the marketplace.

688
00:59:56,246 --> 00:59:58,945
All of this require some
basic elementary science.

689
01:00:00,246 --> 01:00:03,945
This new civilization
having a need for science,

690
01:00:04,537 --> 01:00:07,495
<i>really stems from the need
to run that empire.

691
01:00:09,697 --> 01:00:12,655
The best minds rose to the call.

692
01:00:13,617 --> 01:00:16,734
The finest were welcomed
at a centre of scholarship,

693
01:00:16,937 --> 01:00:20,134
Baghdad's renowned House of Wisdom.

694
01:00:20,337 --> 01:00:23,010
<i>It was a magnet for
scholars and intellectuals

695
01:00:23,011 --> 01:00:26,336
<i>who came and worked
in the academies.

696
01:00:26,337 --> 01:00:29,727
<i>There were public libraries
associated with the palace

697
01:00:29,937 --> 01:00:33,168
<i>and scholars came
from all over the empire.

698
01:00:34,057 --> 01:00:38,016
<i>There were scholars from Iran,
there were scholars from Byzantium.

699
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:41,015
<i>Some were Christians,
some were Muslims, some were Jews.

700
01:00:42,617 --> 01:00:47,327
<i>And all of these different...
sort of threads of human knowledge

701
01:00:50,257 --> 01:00:52,487
<i>So, the net effect of this

702
01:00:52,697 --> 01:00:57,612
<i>is that you've got
human individuals

703
01:00:57,613 --> 01:01:03,115
<i>from radically different cultural traditions
being thrown into the same crucible.

704
01:01:04,777 --> 01:01:08,008
The challenge that greeted
these scholars was daunting.

705
01:01:10,517 --> 01:01:12,578
The great works of the ancients,

706
01:01:12,613 --> 01:01:16,288
had to be transformed
into a wholly new body of knowledge.

707
01:01:20,491 --> 01:01:24,791
Competition for jobs developed
within a new intellectual elite.

708
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:30,892
<i>And from there on, every single
scientist is competing for that job.

709
01:01:30,893 --> 01:01:35,284
<i>They were competing among themselves
almost just... in the same way

710
01:01:35,493 --> 01:01:40,169
<i>that modern bureaucrats and academicians
will fight among themselves.

711
01:01:42,813 --> 01:01:45,247
Scholars were dispatched
across the empire

712
01:01:45,453 --> 01:01:48,525
to locate as many ancient texts
as possible...

713
01:01:48,733 --> 01:01:53,409
the first international
scientific venture in history.

714
01:01:56,013 --> 01:01:58,402
Unlike their Christian counterparts,

715
01:01:58,403 --> 01:02:02,043
Muslim thinkers saw
no insurmountable contradiction

716
01:02:02,044 --> 01:02:06,316
between their faith and
the laws governing the natural world.

717
01:02:06,613 --> 01:02:09,730
<i>So they embraced Aristotle and Plato,

718
01:02:09,731 --> 01:02:12,911
writers the Christian church
considered blasphemous.

719
01:02:12,912 --> 01:02:16,452
<i>So this is the time
when we begin to see

720
01:02:16,453 --> 01:02:19,013
<i>scientists, bureaucrats,
what have you...

721
01:02:19,213 --> 01:02:22,091
<i>going and seeking
from whatever civilisation

722
01:02:22,293 --> 01:02:24,249
<i>that had any sciences before,

723
01:02:24,453 --> 01:02:27,809
<i>be it the Greek, the Indian,
the Persian, and so on.

724
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:32,731
From the Hindus came
mathematical concepts that guide us today.

725
01:02:33,813 --> 01:02:36,486
It was the scholars
of the House of Wisdom

726
01:02:36,693 --> 01:02:40,208
who developed the system
of Arabic numerals, still in use.

727
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:49,569
It is they who translated and transformed
the writings of the Greeks

728
01:02:49,773 --> 01:02:53,209
and made a gift of them
to the modern Western world.

729
01:02:54,453 --> 01:02:58,128
The Renaissance
had its beginnings in Baghdad.

730
01:02:58,248 --> 01:03:01,328
<i>They managed to assimilate

731
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:06,282
<i>quite a lot of the rich legacy
of the Hellenistic world,

732
01:03:06,813 --> 01:03:09,646
<i>translate it into Arabic, initially,

733
01:03:09,853 --> 01:03:14,881
<i>which was then made available
to all other participants

734
01:03:15,093 --> 01:03:17,846
<i>in the new Islamic civilisation.

735
01:03:17,847 --> 01:03:24,847
<i>Arabic emerges as the language
of learning throughout the region.

736
01:03:25,933 --> 01:03:29,972
<i>This is a very significant development
in human intellectual history.

737
01:03:33,273 --> 01:03:37,972
Having amassed the knowledge,
the Muslims began to challenge it.

738
01:03:38,933 --> 01:03:42,130
This was perhaps
their most important contribution.

739
01:03:42,131 --> 01:03:45,131
The scientific process was born.

740
01:03:47,453 --> 01:03:51,492
<i>They wanted to know why
a very intelligent Greek scientist

741
01:03:51,693 --> 01:03:55,049
<i>whose texts they were just admiring
and they were verifying it...

742
01:03:55,253 --> 01:03:57,847
<i>Why would he make a mistake
in the first place?

743
01:03:57,848 --> 01:04:02,728
<i>So they began to dig. Was it because
he didn't have the right instruments?

744
01:04:02,733 --> 01:04:05,964
<i>Or is it because he didn't have
the right methodology

745
01:04:06,173 --> 01:04:10,451
<i>to use the instruments
for the verifications of observation?

746
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:14,683
<i>It is this spirit, you see,
this spirit of questioning,

747
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:17,932
<i>the spirit of saying that we
have to build science constantly

748
01:04:17,933 --> 01:04:20,083
<i>on a systematic, consistent basis,

749
01:04:20,084 --> 01:04:24,412
<i>where we make a physical proposition
of how the universe ought to be run,

750
01:04:24,413 --> 01:04:29,168
<i>and the mathematical representation
of that physical universe ought to match.

751
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:37,670
<i>Now you begin to have what i call
the birth of the new Islamic science.

752
01:04:37,871 --> 01:04:42,471
Algebra and trigonometry,
engineering and astronomy...

753
01:04:42,472 --> 01:04:46,572
Countless disciplines
integral to our lives today

754
01:04:46,613 --> 01:04:49,571
trace their roots to Islamic scientists.

755
01:04:53,013 --> 01:04:56,767
More surprising, perhaps,
were their innovations in medicine.

756
01:05:01,253 --> 01:05:04,723
At a time when Europeans were praying
to the bones of their saints

757
01:05:04,724 --> 01:05:06,724
to cure their illnesses,

758
01:05:07,013 --> 01:05:10,164
Muslim physicians developed
an innovative theory...

759
01:05:11,293 --> 01:05:16,208
that disease was transmitted
through tiny airborne organisms,

760
01:05:16,209 --> 01:05:19,609
the precursor to the study of germs.

761
01:05:22,107 --> 01:05:26,802
They determined that sick patients
should be quarantined and then treated.

762
01:05:26,803 --> 01:05:31,803
This is the basis of the institution
most fundamental to medicine today...

763
01:05:31,804 --> 01:05:33,204
the hospital.

764
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:39,012
Funded mainly
through religious endownments,

765
01:05:39,013 --> 01:05:41,129
Muslim hospitals had separate wards

766
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:45,163
for patience suffering
from different kinds of disease.

767
01:05:45,173 --> 01:05:47,528
Even mental illness was treated.

768
01:05:51,383 --> 01:05:54,412
Their studies of anatomy
were so sophisticated

769
01:05:54,413 --> 01:05:57,962
that they remained in use
by Muslim and European physicians

770
01:05:57,963 --> 01:05:59,963
for 600 years.

771
01:06:08,013 --> 01:06:11,892
Muslim scientists were especially
intrigued by light, lenses

772
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,891
and the physiology of the human eye.

773
01:06:17,888 --> 01:06:22,888
The father of optics
was a muslim named Ibn al-Haytham.

774
01:06:22,933 --> 01:06:28,166
His work with lenses eventually led
to the invention of the modern camera.

775
01:06:29,173 --> 01:06:32,051
He produced the first treatise
that ventured to explain

776
01:06:32,052 --> 01:06:34,452
how the eye actually sees.

777
01:06:39,813 --> 01:06:43,806
A thousand years before the West
dared to take up the practice,

778
01:06:44,013 --> 01:06:47,403
Muslim doctors were removing
cataracts surgically,

779
01:06:47,613 --> 01:06:50,650
clearing them from the eye
with a hollow needle.

780
01:06:54,193 --> 01:06:58,252
But for all this knowledge
to transform and illuminate an empire,

781
01:06:58,253 --> 01:07:00,642
it had to be copied and shared

782
01:07:00,853 --> 01:07:04,368
across a hundred different cities
in the Islamic world.

783
01:07:05,996 --> 01:07:09,812
For this, there was a new invention,

784
01:07:09,813 --> 01:07:13,567
one that is still fundamental
to learning and knowledge today...

785
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:16,090
paper.

786
01:07:17,093 --> 01:07:23,043
<i>Around the year 700 to 750,
when Muslim armies reached Central Asia,

787
01:07:23,044 --> 01:07:26,252
<i>they encountered paper
for the first time.

788
01:07:26,253 --> 01:07:31,327
<i>And, very quickly,
the Muslim bureaucracy

789
01:07:32,613 --> 01:07:34,808
<i>started using paper.

790
01:07:35,253 --> 01:07:38,131
<i>You find that within
50 years it's in Syria.

791
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:41,131
<i>Then a few years later
it's in Egypt.

792
01:07:41,132 --> 01:07:42,745
<i>Then it's in North Africa.

793
01:07:42,746 --> 01:07:46,052
<i>Then it's in Sicily,
then it's in Spain.

794
01:07:46,053 --> 01:07:48,726
<i>And that's where Europe
learned to make paper.

795
01:07:48,933 --> 01:07:51,686
<i>They learned to make it
from the Arabs.

796
01:07:54,054 --> 01:07:57,572
<i>We begin to have people
with family names like Papermaker.

797
01:07:57,573 --> 01:08:00,883
<i>So, in other words, it was not only
that paper was available.

798
01:08:01,093 --> 01:08:05,052
<i>It must have become
a very, very widespread industry.

799
01:08:05,053 --> 01:08:09,053
<i>And hence the acquisition of books
must have also become very easy.

800
01:08:11,773 --> 01:08:14,492
With the wide use
of books and paper,

801
01:08:14,493 --> 01:08:17,932
hundreds of scribes,
some of whom were women,

802
01:08:17,933 --> 01:08:21,369
were kept busy transcribing
the translations and new writings

803
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:22,370
of the Baghdad scholars.

804
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:28,892
<i>All of this knowledge
that's being acquired from the Greeks

805
01:08:28,893 --> 01:08:31,327
<i>and from the Indians
and from Central Asians

806
01:08:31,533 --> 01:08:34,809
<i>is all beingswritten down
in books on paper.

807
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:39,530
<i>And these books are being copied
and re-copied and sent around.

808
01:08:39,533 --> 01:08:43,162
<i>We know, for example,
that there was a street of booksellers

809
01:08:43,373 --> 01:08:45,568
<i>with more than a hundred shops,

810
01:08:45,773 --> 01:08:48,890
<i>each one with paper
and books for sale.

811
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:53,406
<i>And this is a time when,
you know, in Europe,

812
01:08:53,407 --> 01:08:57,407
<i>a monastery would be lucky
if it had five or ten books.

813
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:03,012
While the monks of the West
were hoarding their wisdom

814
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:04,969
on scraps of expensive parchment,

815
01:09:05,173 --> 01:09:10,372
paper enabled Islamic civilisation to spread
its newfound knowledge far and wide,

816
01:09:10,573 --> 01:09:14,851
creatingu single community,
linking three continents.

817
01:09:16,213 --> 01:09:21,003
<i>So, the chief distinction, therefore,
of Islamic civilisation,

818
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:26,288
<i>in addition to the fact
that it made new leaps of originality,

819
01:09:26,289 --> 01:09:32,089
<i>New transformations in traditions
of learning and everything else possible,

820
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:37,812
<i>is the fact that it enabled human beings
to consider the possibility

821
01:09:37,813 --> 01:09:42,967
<i>of thinking about the globe
as a single unit... humanity.

822
01:09:47,493 --> 01:09:49,609
In all the broad empire,

823
01:09:49,813 --> 01:09:53,249
there was one place the Christian world
could experience the lifestyle

824
01:09:53,453 --> 01:09:55,648
Muslims now took for granted...

825
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:59,293
southern Spain.

826
01:10:05,293 --> 01:10:08,330
Here, on the European continent itself,

827
01:10:08,533 --> 01:10:11,206
Islamic culture
would begin to have an effect

828
01:10:11,413 --> 01:10:14,086
on the European civilisation
around it.

829
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:17,745
A thousand years ago,

830
01:10:17,773 --> 01:10:21,482
the Spanish city of Cordoba
was a centre of learning and culture

831
01:10:21,693 --> 01:10:23,729
that rivalled Baghdad.

832
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:31,569
Today, Cordoba's narrow lanes
hearken to its medieval past.

833
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,100
During the Dark Ages,

834
01:10:36,213 --> 01:10:40,525
this was the most prosperous and
sophisticated metropolis on the continent.

835
01:10:42,053 --> 01:10:45,045
It had streetlights and paved roads,

836
01:10:45,046 --> 01:10:48,715
libraries, hospitals and palaces.

837
01:10:48,733 --> 01:10:52,646
This was a city of light...
a Muslim city.

838
01:10:59,973 --> 01:11:02,806
<i>We have descriptions of it
by people coming and saying

839
01:11:03,013 --> 01:11:06,130
<i>"All these flowers
everywhere, open streets,

840
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:08,528
<i>"this wonderful light
comingtown..."

841
01:11:09,293 --> 01:11:11,329
<i>Northern cities were dark.

842
01:11:12,093 --> 01:11:16,644
<i>Cordoba had running water.
People lived in big houses.

843
01:11:16,853 --> 01:11:21,290
<i>In contrast, in Paris, people lived
in shacks by the side of the river.

844
01:11:25,453 --> 01:11:28,286
The glory of medieval Cordoba is here,

845
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:33,089
in what is now the great Roman Catholic
cathedral in the middle of town.

846
01:11:36,853 --> 01:11:41,529
But the Cordoba Cathedral of today
began its life as a mosque...

847
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:44,914
one of the grandest
of the Islamic empire.

848
01:11:44,915 --> 01:11:49,172
<i>The Great Mosque in Cordoba
was simply the biggest mosque

849
01:11:49,173 --> 01:11:52,006
<i>in the biggest city
in southern Europe.

850
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:56,213
<i>When you climb the church tower
which used to be a minaret,

851
01:11:56,248 --> 01:11:58,647
<i>you look out over
this expanse of roof.

852
01:12:01,413 --> 01:12:03,085
<i>Complete with
flying buttresses,

853
01:12:03,293 --> 01:12:07,172
<i>popping up out of the middle
of this massive mosque.

854
01:12:11,773 --> 01:12:14,412
<i>Many, many people came to visit it,

855
01:12:14,613 --> 01:12:17,286
<i>to view the wonders of the mosque,

856
01:12:17,287 --> 01:12:19,812
<i>which had rib vaulting.

857
01:12:19,813 --> 01:12:22,964
<i>The kind of vaulting
which is like this

858
01:12:23,173 --> 01:12:25,129
<i>and which,
100 years later,

859
01:12:28,053 --> 01:12:29,884
<i>but not at all a coincidence,

860
01:12:30,093 --> 01:12:33,324
<i>appears in the Gothic cathedrals
of northern Europe,

861
01:12:33,325 --> 01:12:36,812
<i>in Lincoln Cathedral
in Chartes Cathedral in France.

862
01:12:36,813 --> 01:12:38,485
<i>Where does that come from?

863
01:12:38,486 --> 01:12:44,486
<i>Obviously, influenced by the Great Mosque
of Cordoba in the south of Spain.

864
01:12:47,133 --> 01:12:50,284
For the occasional
European Christian traveller,

865
01:12:50,285 --> 01:12:54,285
Cordoba was the one opportunity
the climpse the Islamic world

866
01:12:55,546 --> 01:12:58,286
What they saw, was shocking...

867
01:12:59,013 --> 01:13:02,722
Most of Europe at that time
languished in poverty and squalor.

868
01:13:02,723 --> 01:13:07,723
Cordoba was a pageant
of prosperity and enlightment.

869
01:13:08,013 --> 01:13:12,131
<i>In the 10th century
there was a Saxon nun

870
01:13:12,333 --> 01:13:15,484
<i>with the unpronounceable name
of Hrotswitha

871
01:13:15,485 --> 01:13:20,485
<i>who called medieval Cordoba
"the ornament of the world".

872
01:13:20,486 --> 01:13:22,486
She was very, very taken
with the place.

873
01:13:22,487 --> 01:13:24,486
and she was a Christian nun.

874
01:13:31,246 --> 01:13:35,186
As Europeans made their way from the
cold stone of their northern castles...

875
01:13:35,187 --> 01:13:38,386
into the glorious
Muslim cities of Southern Spain,

876
01:13:38,746 --> 01:13:40,886
they couldn't help
of being impressed.

877
01:13:43,386 --> 01:13:47,386
In the green hills above Granada,
was a palace of startling elegance.

878
01:13:48,286 --> 01:13:52,986
A shining example of the richness
and sophistication Islam brought
to medieval Europe.

879
01:13:54,246 --> 01:13:56,386
It's called the Alhamra.

880
01:14:00,086 --> 01:14:03,666
The Alhamra is, perhaps
the most famous example...

881
01:14:03,701 --> 01:14:07,246
...of the Islamic architecture
to most Westerners.

882
01:14:09,746 --> 01:14:13,026
It is the best remaining example of...

883
01:14:13,046 --> 01:14:15,546
...what a medieval Muslim palace
would've look like.

884
01:16:20,798 --> 01:16:25,235
How far Muhammad's followers had come
from the life of desert nomads.

885
01:16:26,238 --> 01:16:30,516
How distant they felt from the rest
of the European continent they now shared.

886
01:16:31,478 --> 01:16:36,836
Christian Europe, due north,
was struggling on through the Dark Ages.

887
01:16:44,718 --> 01:16:48,393
a tragedy in Jerusalem would put
Muslims and European Christians

888
01:16:48,598 --> 01:16:50,714
on a collision course.

889
01:16:53,318 --> 01:16:56,276
Jerusalem was ruled
by an Egyptian caliph,

890
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:58,187
an infamous man named al-Hakim.

891
01:16:58,222 --> 01:16:59,897
But at the dawn of 11th century,

892
01:17:05,038 --> 01:17:08,189
<i>Clinically speaking, I suppose,
today we'd regard him as a madman,

893
01:17:08,398 --> 01:17:10,116
<i>as simply insane.

894
01:17:12,316 --> 01:17:15,416
For 200 years, the Christian holy
places in Jerusalem...

895
01:17:15,478 --> 01:17:19,114
...had been respected
and protected by Muslim rulers.

896
01:17:22,678 --> 01:17:27,547
In 1009, the Egyptian ruler al-Hakim
broke with that tradition.

897
01:17:30,038 --> 01:17:34,111
He ordered the holiest church
in Christendom destroyed.

898
01:17:35,598 --> 01:17:37,714
<i>And, horror of horrors,

899
01:17:37,918 --> 01:17:41,831
<i>he burnt down the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.

900
01:17:42,758 --> 01:17:45,477
<i>Nobody knows quite why he did it,

901
01:17:45,777 --> 01:17:48,758
<i>and you can have
your own theories about it,

902
01:17:48,793 --> 01:17:51,716
<i>but the fact of the matter was

903
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:56,469
<i>that that sent shivers
of terror and anxiety

904
01:17:56,678 --> 01:17:58,589
<i>through Christendom.

905
01:17:58,798 --> 01:18:00,675
<i>In a way, of course,

906
01:18:01,476 --> 01:18:06,476
<i>el-Hakim was the one exception
and proved the rule for Christians

907
01:18:06,678 --> 01:18:09,431
<i>that Christians had been
speaking of for centuries,

908
01:18:09,638 --> 01:18:14,951
<i>of Muslims as intolerant, mad,
slavering heretics

909
01:18:15,051 --> 01:18:17,251
<i>who simply could not be...

910
01:18:17,551 --> 01:18:21,451
<i>...expected to abide by the
rules of civilised human beings.

911
01:18:27,551 --> 01:18:30,051
<i>The fact that al-Hakim's succesor

912
01:18:30,518 --> 01:18:33,749
<i>rebuilt the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre...

913
01:18:33,958 --> 01:18:37,633
<i>it was done by 1048
with Byzantine help...

914
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:40,113
<i>didn't cut any ice.

915
01:18:40,318 --> 01:18:42,149
<i>There was this perception now

916
01:18:42,358 --> 01:18:45,236
<i>that things were not going well
in the Holy Land.
