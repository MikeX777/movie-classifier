1
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:18,749
Uncle, let's do it!

2
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,041
1, 2, 3.

3
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,957
Golf Gift, very expensive car.

4
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:51,832
Not bad.

5
00:02:58,707 --> 00:03:02,124
Is this your car? Pretty.

6
00:03:02,124 --> 00:03:04,541
You don't have to worry.

7
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,541
No thief here.

8
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:11,707
Does it cost around $150,0007

9
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,291
How do I know, I stole it?

10
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,332
Piggy, time to move.

11
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:17,791
Yes.

12
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:21,374
Uncle, you finished my part already.

13
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:22,791
What are you looking at?

14
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:27,416
Start the engine, don't look like a dumb.

15
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:38,457
You have to pick up all the pigs
from Uncle Choi early in tomorrow.

16
00:03:38,457 --> 00:03:42,041
Uncle, you will be rich.

17
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:43,874
What do you mean?

18
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:45,499
You will be the best slaughter.

19
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:48,207
I come because Ah Fatt is busy.

20
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:50,499
It's a hard job of our filed.

21
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:53,707
Then we have to get up at 4am.

22
00:03:54,124 --> 00:03:58,332
Not 4am, 3am. I will wake you up.

23
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:01,832
It only takes 12 min from Sai Kung to Kowloon.

24
00:04:01,832 --> 00:04:04,207
Just 12 min.

25
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:07,582
This car breaks down is all because of you.

26
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:08,249
Hey.

27
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:10,457
Be careful.

28
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:12,249
Don't be scared if I drive,

29
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:17,832
Uncle, just sit still.

30
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:19,582
I am terrific.

31
00:04:27,457 --> 00:04:29,124
Are you crazy, slow down.

32
00:04:35,957 --> 00:04:37,291
Slow down...

33
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:47,291
slow down...

34
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:50,624
Don't drive so fast.

35
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:11,249
Come on, you can't catch up with others.

36
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,749
Come on.

37
00:05:21,624 --> 00:05:26,791
I ask you to drive those pigs
not to challenge with others.

38
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:28,541
Go away, let me drive.

39
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,249
I can handle it.

40
00:05:50,457 --> 00:05:53,457
Shit. Have to thank god that we still alive.

41
00:05:53,457 --> 00:05:56,541
Go and find a car to deliver.

42
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:05,207
Jesus, I promised Chou to send him the pigs.

43
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:06,791
Uncle.

44
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,249
What's the matter?

45
00:06:08,332 --> 00:06:09,707
Just scold

46
00:06:09,707 --> 00:06:11,541
if it will make you feel better.

47
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,624
Do you think that is enough?

48
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,624
I promise it won't happen again.

49
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:16,749
What's the matter?

50
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:18,249
Those pigs.

51
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:26,041
My hero, there are only 2 left out of 10.

52
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,791
That is fun.

53
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:29,416
You'll feel better to say it out.

54
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,624
You'll feel better to say it out.

55
00:06:36,832 --> 00:06:41,124
Don't tell me that this vehicle
need a service again.

56
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:45,916
Don't mumbling all the time,

57
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,457
if he goes back to England..

58
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:48,999
Then you will cry all day.

59
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:50,249
Ah Kao.

60
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:51,999
What did you say?

61
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:54,457
I am cleaning the pigs.

62
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,957
I can find someone to replace the job easily.

63
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,791
You are so powerful,
why don't you have a boy with me.

64
00:07:10,624 --> 00:07:13,457
Get up and have lunch.

65
00:07:14,082 --> 00:07:14,957
Uncle!

66
00:07:17,582 --> 00:07:19,582
Siu Chu, what's the matter?

67
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:23,207
Don't bother your auntie.

68
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:26,791
She doesn't mean that.

69
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:31,874
How can you stay with them for your life?

70
00:07:31,874 --> 00:07:33,124
Don't you feel sick?

71
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:37,582
They support your life.

72
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,457
Do you feel that?

73
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:42,332
Uncle, I want to do something else.

74
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:50,166
I mention a few words and you want to quit.

75
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:55,249
I need a change.

76
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:59,707
What can you do? You are not well educated.

77
00:08:00,624 --> 00:08:04,707
I can drive and I can cook.

78
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:07,166
I can work hard, I won't be starved.

79
00:08:07,582 --> 00:08:13,624
Surely, you can leave when-ever you want to.

80
00:08:14,874 --> 00:08:17,999
Last time you want to go England

81
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:20,166
I bought you the ticket.

82
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,332
Came back and said you want a car, I got you one.

83
00:08:24,332 --> 00:08:25,916
I treat you as my son!

84
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:29,624
I want to work in town.

85
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:32,707
Go all the way to England,

86
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:34,499
you can do nothing.

87
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:37,707
Except washing dishes in Chinatown.

88
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,541
You can't compare with them,

89
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:44,249
my brother is lazy bone.

90
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:46,457
Don't say anything good words for him.

91
00:08:46,457 --> 00:08:47,874
We brought you up,

92
00:08:47,874 --> 00:08:50,082
only asking you to help in the family.

93
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:52,082
After I came back

94
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:53,916
and help you for two years already.

95
00:08:53,957 --> 00:08:58,832
Alright, if you like just let him go.

96
00:08:58,832 --> 00:09:00,416
And don't come back again.

97
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:04,332
Auntie, I didn't say I want to move out.

98
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:08,166
Doesn't matter,

99
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:09,916
you are an adult.

100
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:14,624
You can support yourself and leave us behind.

101
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:21,957
You go and find a job,

102
00:09:21,957 --> 00:09:24,457
I can manage by myself.

103
00:09:24,457 --> 00:09:27,582
Come back if you want to.

104
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:33,082
Go to HK Restaurant and look for Meat Ball.

105
00:09:33,082 --> 00:09:33,957
What Ball?

106
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:39,707
He is the son of Choy Tau, maybe he can help you.

107
00:10:01,124 --> 00:10:02,832
Bill please. Go and have a look!

108
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:04,166
Yes, manager.

109
00:10:08,332 --> 00:10:09,249
You are the son of Uncle Chuen.

110
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:12,457
Yes, you are meat ball, I know your Pa very well.

111
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:15,416
I heard about your father but I don't know him.

112
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,332
The best gambler in Chinatown?

113
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:22,166
Yes, he has many debtors in London Chinatown.

114
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:26,041
Your father has a lot of girl friends.

115
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,624
And they are bronze.

116
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,207
My uncle told me that.

117
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:37,041
You are looking for a job,

118
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:38,707
what can you do?

119
00:10:39,582 --> 00:10:42,249
I was a waiter in Chinatown.

120
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:44,457
Actually I've worked for different post.

121
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,374
I'm a good cook.

122
00:10:46,374 --> 00:10:47,666
My favourite dish is fried chop tsun.

123
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,291
You can cheat the foreigners

124
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,124
but not in HK.

125
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:55,416
What else can you do except
working in the kitchen.

126
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:57,874
Driver,

127
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,957
I drive for my uncle for 2 years.

128
00:11:00,957 --> 00:11:03,832
Good, we have a post in the parking service.

129
00:11:03,832 --> 00:11:05,624
It's a tough job.

130
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,666
Living on the client's tips.

131
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:13,541
That's OK, I can manage.

132
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,082
When can I start?

133
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:16,916
Now, I'll show you the way.

134
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:20,582
Thanks, Meat... Mr. Chow.

135
00:11:24,124 --> 00:11:25,207
Manger!

136
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:33,124
Get up.

137
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:34,416
Mr. Chow.

138
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,624
- The champion?
- It's you.

139
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:40,166
Are you working here?

140
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:41,916
You know each other?

141
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:42,582
Yes, last night.

142
00:11:42,582 --> 00:11:43,541
Yes.

143
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,916
He is working for us now.

144
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,707
You will be the partner.

145
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,874
I'm Stanley,

146
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,999
take care of me in the future.

147
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:52,041
Not you,

148
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,749
have to take care of the cars.

149
00:11:53,749 --> 00:11:55,249
Where is Ah Wing?

150
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,791
He s parking a car.

151
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,041
Ah Wing.

152
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,082
Come over!

153
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,666
What's the matter? You are sleeping

154
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:06,332
and he is gambling,

155
00:12:06,332 --> 00:12:07,957
what are you two doing?

156
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:11,666
Mr. Chow, we have nothing to do.

157
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:13,457
I have a lot of complaints

158
00:12:13,457 --> 00:12:14,999
about your attitudes.

159
00:12:15,582 --> 00:12:18,082
Ask them to park their cars somewhere else then.

160
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,957
You are hopeless,
change the uniform with Ah Man.

161
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:23,374
Manager, the captain is looking for you.

162
00:12:23,374 --> 00:12:25,457
OK, Ah Man will show you what you should do.

163
00:12:25,457 --> 00:12:26,832
Thanks, Mr. Chow.

164
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,791
Where can I change the uniform.

165
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:38,874
What can I do now?

166
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:44,166
The most important is keeping
the key in good order.

167
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,332
And have a clear mind and fast action.

168
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:49,957
No need to count the tips, just put it here.

169
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:52,624
Why?

170
00:12:52,624 --> 00:12:55,624
The clients are so stingy,
they won't give a big tips.

171
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:56,874
That's it.

172
00:13:02,207 --> 00:13:03,832
A Rolls Royce,

173
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:05,166
how come he hasn't had a driver?

174
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:08,124
May be he doesn't like that.

175
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,999
It's better to drive it himself.

176
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,457
Ah Man, let me part it.

177
00:13:13,457 --> 00:13:17,582
Ok, park it in the car park. Be careful.

178
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:18,874
Alright.

179
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:22,457
Having dinner, sir?

180
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,249
He is simply a car enthusiast.

181
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:37,166
What are you doing?

182
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,291
You are looking the way. Start the engine.

183
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,041
What are you doing?

184
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:39,874
Sorry.

185
00:13:39,874 --> 00:13:40,957
- Are you new comer?
- I'll leave a minute.

186
00:13:40,957 --> 00:13:42,707
Get away now.

187
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:57,291
You are not riding a horse.

188
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,499
He is so rough.

189
00:14:24,457 --> 00:14:25,499
What are we going to do?

190
00:14:25,874 --> 00:14:29,124
Is it your car?

191
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:31,041
I can't get through.

192
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,457
Parking it at the back.

193
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:40,416
That car is not having much luck.

194
00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:47,749
Is there any good one?

195
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:49,457
No.2 in Arch 1.

196
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:52,166
What takes you so long?
Can't you manager that car?

197
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:55,707
He looks like not knowing to drive.

198
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:58,249
He had a bump and crashed the bumper.

199
00:14:58,249 --> 00:14:59,666
And don't even bother.

200
00:14:59,957 --> 00:15:02,957
Mind your own business.

201
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:05,332
The client will notice.

202
00:15:05,332 --> 00:15:07,291
He is not your client.

203
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:11,249
What is his name?

204
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,957
He is the big brother

205
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,374
when he is rich and dummy when he is broke.

206
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,374
He'll even steal the governor's car
when he is the mood.

207
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:24,124
Don't bother too much.

208
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:27,582
You've to be smart working here.

209
00:15:27,957 --> 00:15:29,374
Being the big brother?

210
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:31,582
Being a dummy.

211
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,374
Ah Man, nice magazine.

212
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:49,666
Who has spare money to lend me?

213
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,791
And I will give back to you very soon.

214
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:52,916
OK.

215
00:16:04,207 --> 00:16:07,207
Thanks, I haven't seen you before.

216
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,041
Today is my first date here.

217
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,124
I am working upstairs.

218
00:16:13,124 --> 00:16:16,124
I am Gigi. What is your name?

219
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:17,291
Stanley.

220
00:16:18,082 --> 00:16:21,416
Stanley, come to visit me when you are free.

221
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:22,707
- OK.
- Bye.

222
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:25,374
Bye.

223
00:16:27,624 --> 00:16:30,041
You're the only to trust her.

224
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:31,332
Why?

225
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:35,957
Don't think she is a nice girl?

226
00:16:35,957 --> 00:16:38,374
So you think she is cheating my $207?

227
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:40,999
No, she'll give you back just now.

228
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:44,457
Together with a lot of food.

229
00:16:45,582 --> 00:16:51,874
Then... there's a lot of space behind.

230
00:16:52,957 --> 00:16:54,999
Pull it tight.

231
00:16:57,457 --> 00:17:01,791
Park it again.

232
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,999
Miss, can I park it for you?

233
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,291
Thanks.

234
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:17,791
Never see him that anxious.

235
00:17:18,624 --> 00:17:20,499
May be she is his show white.

236
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,541
She comes very often,

237
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,457
she just has a Benz sport car.

238
00:17:53,957 --> 00:17:55,291
Stealing again.

239
00:18:16,957 --> 00:18:17,874
Uncle.

240
00:18:18,999 --> 00:18:20,707
- Morning
- Sleep a bit longer,

241
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:21,832
you come back at 4am this morning.

242
00:18:21,832 --> 00:18:23,249
Take care of yourself.

243
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:27,707
I had enough. Can you manage without me?

244
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,707
I am not a old man yet.

245
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:35,082
Why people still go out in the mid-night?

246
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:39,082
Auntie, people sleep early here.

247
00:18:39,082 --> 00:18:42,957
People in town they will come out very late.

248
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:44,124
Really?

249
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:45,999
Yes.

250
00:18:47,124 --> 00:18:49,874
How's life out here.

251
00:18:51,082 --> 00:18:53,124
All the car that

252
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:54,541
I parked yesterday.

253
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:56,249
Cost more than $1,000,000.

254
00:18:56,249 --> 00:18:58,957
I even parked for Alan Tam.

255
00:18:58,957 --> 00:19:02,332
You have to work harder.

256
00:19:02,332 --> 00:19:04,832
I will.

257
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:11,999
You are so early?

258
00:19:12,707 --> 00:19:13,957
Doesn't matter.

259
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:15,832
Take it easy.

260
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:17,166
Where are you going?

261
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:18,124
Get change.

262
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,207
What are you doing, you want to have a raise.

263
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,707
Feeling better to work in a neat place.

264
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,124
I am staffing, go and have the breakfast.

265
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:29,166
Too early.

266
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,291
Go.

267
00:19:41,707 --> 00:19:43,416
Disgusting good.

268
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:45,999
You don't have the appetite.

269
00:19:46,832 --> 00:19:48,791
I don't understand how can those
foreigner would like these.

270
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:52,374
Mixing all the things together, and tasteless.

271
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:55,832
When I was in London.

272
00:19:55,832 --> 00:19:58,749
I prefer the instant noodle then the biscuits.

273
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,791
You don't believe that I've been to London.

274
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:05,582
I didn't say that.

275
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:09,582
I am so familiar with the shops in Chinatown.

276
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:12,791
There is a very famous pub in London,
next to that pub

277
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:15,999
<i>is 2 night club, you can see a stripe dance.</i>

278
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,999
I went there every night.

279
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:27,291
I suggest we change all these old stuff.

280
00:20:27,707 --> 00:20:30,374
The bulbs & wire, they are really too old.

281
00:20:30,374 --> 00:20:32,749
Forget it, the restaurant is not in good business.

282
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:34,957
May be we turned the light brighter

283
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:38,041
will be better.

284
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,457
It's very important for the lighting.

285
00:20:39,457 --> 00:20:41,749
The Japanese restaurant is doing
much better than us.

286
00:20:43,457 --> 00:20:45,332
Your snow white is there.

287
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:46,957
Give me a deluxe pizza, take away.

288
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:47,582
Fine.

289
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,374
She looks great driving a beautiful car.

290
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:56,666
She has a ticket.

291
00:20:57,374 --> 00:21:00,957
Go and tell her.

292
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:07,624
Miss, you are having a ticket.

293
00:21:08,874 --> 00:21:10,082
Never mind.

294
00:21:12,624 --> 00:21:13,832
Thanks.

295
00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:27,041
What happen? Did you get her name?

296
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,332
She said never mind.

297
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:47,166
Great. If I can spend $100,000
to buy a Benz sports

298
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:50,041
I won't care for it too. Here is $140.

299
00:21:52,749 --> 00:21:54,166
How do you feel

300
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,124
if you can sleep with this beautiful girl?

301
00:21:58,707 --> 00:22:00,374
Even shorten my life for 10 years.

302
00:22:00,374 --> 00:22:04,874
For a girl?

303
00:22:04,874 --> 00:22:08,291
I won't do it. If I will be a millionaire.

304
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:10,499
I can have 10 girls like her.

305
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:12,749
It's not worth to shorten my life.

306
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:17,041
You are only dream to be a millionaire.

307
00:22:33,624 --> 00:22:35,249
Don't be so stingy.

308
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:36,749
Thanks.

309
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:39,916
Thank you.

310
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:41,457
We are not owing each other.

311
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:44,291
Bye!

312
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,291
Gigi, she won't pay attention

313
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,874
to other money.

314
00:22:52,457 --> 00:22:53,832
Hey, this $20 is mine.

315
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:02,166
We really need to change our uniform.

316
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,457
Blue and White.

317
00:23:04,457 --> 00:23:06,832
Will look better with a red line

318
00:23:07,291 --> 00:23:10,582
Do you think we are the waiter in the hotel?

319
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:14,707
You shouldn't say that,
everyone need to wear properly.

320
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:19,624
Everyone will look better with neat outfit.

321
00:23:19,624 --> 00:23:22,291
More business more money.

322
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,124
You're too innocent.

323
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:27,499
Did I say anything wrong?
Not like you with a loose button

324
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,374
and sit like a dumb,

325
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:31,999
even the money god will run away.

326
00:23:33,249 --> 00:23:37,249
You should have a aim and dream.

327
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,457
Then you will live happily.

328
00:23:40,291 --> 00:23:43,249
I am not in the mood.

329
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:47,374
Come out, when you feel blue

330
00:23:47,374 --> 00:23:50,999
just shout out loud.

331
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,124
Not like this,

332
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,082
Louder.

333
00:24:06,624 --> 00:24:10,166
Send those policeman away first.

334
00:24:12,457 --> 00:24:14,374
Come for dinner, Sir?

335
00:24:14,374 --> 00:24:15,707
Hand me your keys.

336
00:24:15,707 --> 00:24:17,582
How do you know that I am a policeman.

337
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:18,832
You look so smart,

338
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,207
just like a F.B.l. from Scotland.

339
00:24:21,207 --> 00:24:23,582
F.B.l. in Scotland?

340
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:26,207
Anyway you have good judge.

341
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:27,541
Haven't seen you before.

342
00:24:27,541 --> 00:24:29,832
I am new here. I am Stanley.

343
00:24:29,832 --> 00:24:30,791
Stanley.

344
00:24:31,082 --> 00:24:32,499
No need to work tonight?

345
00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:34,166
Have to go back the police station later.

346
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:35,832
Is it hard to be a policeman?

347
00:24:35,832 --> 00:24:37,207
No regular hours.

348
00:24:37,582 --> 00:24:41,541
A bit too busy.

349
00:24:42,082 --> 00:24:44,666
There are very few policeman as nice as you.

350
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:45,916
Really?

351
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:46,999
Of course.

352
00:24:48,207 --> 00:24:49,874
We are both workers.

353
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:55,957
What were you talking about,
he won't give you big tips.

354
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:59,999
That's the manner.

355
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:00,957
Professional smile.

356
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,707
May be he will feel embarrassed next time?

357
00:25:04,374 --> 00:25:05,791
What's happening?

358
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:08,291
You know many horse riders?

359
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:09,416
Do you have any tips?

360
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:11,416
I will be rich this time.

361
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:12,916
- What is going on?
- But you've to help me this time.

362
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:16,791
You still own me $300.

363
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:17,791
Don't think about it.

364
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:18,999
Are we good friend?

365
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:20,041
Don't come again.

366
00:25:20,541 --> 00:25:21,832
That's it.

367
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:25,666
I'll give you back on Saturday.

368
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:28,124
Hong Kong is free to say anything you like to.

369
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:29,166
Come on.

370
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:39,416

Do you get use to it?

373
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:47,541
I've been working here for a week only.

374
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:52,874
If anyone is teasing you, just tell me.

375
00:25:52,874 --> 00:25:54,041
In this area,

376
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:56,457
everyone will give me face.

377
00:25:56,457 --> 00:25:57,166
Really?

378
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,124
Of course.

379
00:25:58,124 --> 00:25:59,207
Dummy.

380
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:04,707
Why don't you return my call?

381
00:26:09,874 --> 00:26:11,332
What the hell are you doing?

382
00:26:13,624 --> 00:26:14,791

383
00:26:14,791 --> 00:26:17,207

384
00:26:17,207 --> 00:26:17,832
What is it?

385
00:26:17,832 --> 00:26:20,832
Go over that side.

386
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:22,624
Don't push me!

387
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:31,291
Big brother.

388
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:32,041
How about the debt?

389
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,874
Give me one more chance?

390
00:26:33,874 --> 00:26:35,249
Are you acting?

391
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:37,124
Saturday will be already.

392
00:26:37,124 --> 00:26:43,957
OK. That's it. Thanks. Bye.

393
00:26:43,957 --> 00:26:45,791
OK, Dummy,

394
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:48,374
my tire is time to change it.

395
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:49,207
Do it for me.

396
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:51,541
No problem. I will handle it.

397
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:52,499
Don't forget.

398
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:54,374
OK.

399
00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:47,749
Are you scare? If so quit now.

400
00:27:51,124 --> 00:27:53,541
Why are you following me?

401
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:54,707
You steal cars each night.

402
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:58,416
You'll get caught one day.

403
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:02,499
I'm not afraid wherever I drive to.

404
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:05,249
But that's a stolen car.

405
00:28:05,291 --> 00:28:07,666
Use my car,

406
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:10,082
it's fabulous.

407
00:28:14,707 --> 00:28:16,832
Did you ever get caught?

408
00:28:16,832 --> 00:28:22,749
No. In Hong Kong people impress by others outlook.

409
00:28:23,207 --> 00:28:26,041
Don't let people to look down upon on you.

410
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:28,624
So don't let people do that to you.

411
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,457
Don't lose any chance to earn money.

412
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:33,582
I want an expensive car.

413
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:35,374
You are dreaming.

414
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:37,416
At least I have a dream.

415
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,749
I am a good driver.

416
00:28:39,749 --> 00:28:41,874
We can still make a good use of the old car?

417
00:29:47,624 --> 00:29:49,082
I know you are a good driver.

418
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:50,999
No need to show to me.

419
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:55,499
I get used to this car already.

420
00:29:55,499 --> 00:29:59,457
I have confidence of myself.

421
00:29:59,457 --> 00:30:03,416
No wonder you can't stay long in a job.

422
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:04,999
And come here parking cars for others.

423
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:10,041
But it's still better to feed the pigs.

424
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:14,124
I can see more to work in here.

425
00:30:14,124 --> 00:30:17,582
Each day I park the cars cost over $100.000.

426
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:21,999
But they still don't belong to you.

427
00:30:21,999 --> 00:30:23,916
But I feel alright already.

428
00:30:26,082 --> 00:30:31,749
Getting a couple thousand dollars each months.

429
00:30:40,832 --> 00:30:42,416
Can't even support your own self?

430
00:30:45,832 --> 00:30:48,332
Find a way to earn more money.

431
00:30:48,749 --> 00:30:50,624
You always look like you are morning.

432
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:53,041
If ll am the client,

433
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:55,291
I won't like to see you also.

434
00:30:57,541 --> 00:31:03,916
Smile will make the world more beautiful.

435
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:08,166
That's too cheap,

436
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,749
I won't do it.

437
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:13,541
Cheap? That's the manner,

438
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:16,166
we are serving for parking.

439
00:31:16,832 --> 00:31:21,457
Always says "calling each one big brother".

440
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:25,582
Plus a little smile, will have a lot returns.

441
00:31:33,957 --> 00:31:36,166
Does your sister have
everything ready to go to England?

442
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:37,957
Pay the fee will be alright.

443
00:31:37,957 --> 00:31:41,374

444
00:31:41,374 --> 00:31:42,624

No problems.

449
00:31:55,749 --> 00:32:00,666
I am late as I have to collect the photos.

450
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:02,874
Can I see it?

451
00:32:03,582 --> 00:32:07,916

452
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:09,291

472
00:33:00,707 --> 00:33:01,624
Smile?

473
00:33:03,499 --> 00:33:05,082

474
00:33:05,082 --> 00:33:07,291
No? My master is Ah Man.

475
00:33:08,499 --> 00:33:13,124
Pull it over.

476
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:17,541
Shit. Wrong information.

00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:22,207

00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:31,124
So you can't pay me back that you own me.

482
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:34,541
You're shorty,

484
00:33:35,957 --> 00:33:37,124
I thought of that too.

00:33:37,124 --> 00:33:39,416
Stopping annoying me.

486
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:41,207
I am scared to fall.

487
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:43,916
Your pizza is coming?

488
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:45,041
Really?

489
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:46,416

493
00:33:56,166 --> 00:33:57,416
I don't want to do this.

494
00:33:57,416 --> 00:33:58,832
Go!

495
00:33:58,832 --> 00:34:01,166
Take that wire over?

496
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,999
Get it through the car.

497
00:34:10,124 --> 00:34:11,499
OK?

498
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:16,332
Hurry up!

499
00:34:31,374 --> 00:34:32,124
For two?

500
00:34:32,124 --> 00:34:32,874
Yes.

501
00:34:33,707 --> 00:34:34,791
Come in.

502
00:34:38,124 --> 00:34:39,707
Will she get an electric shock?

503
00:34:39,707 --> 00:34:42,707
Only 1 volts.

504
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:55,082
What are you standing here for?

505
00:34:55,082 --> 00:34:58,041
Save her.

506
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:03,332
What happened?

507
00:35:03,332 --> 00:35:05,416
She is fainted.

508
00:35:05,832 --> 00:35:08,874
Miss, the battery is not working probably,

509
00:35:09,332 --> 00:35:11,166

510
00:35:16,707 --> 00:35:19,874

You bought many stuff.

512
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:22,957
Childish!

513
00:35:37,957 --> 00:35:39,041
Childish!

514
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:45,332
Yan Yan, are you going to study abroad?

515
00:35:45,332 --> 00:35:46,166
Yes,

516
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:47,832
I passed the London High School exam already.

517
00:35:47,832 --> 00:35:48,916
England?

518
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:50,874
I am very familiar with that place.

519
00:35:50,874 --> 00:35:53,499
Really? My brother didn't mention it?

520
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:55,666
Your brother will be a good spy.

521
00:35:55,666 --> 00:35:56,624
Why?

522
00:35:56,624 --> 00:35:59,416
He never says a word

523
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:01,249
that's good to keep secrets.

524
00:36:01,249 --> 00:36:03,124
You said everything.

525
00:36:03,124 --> 00:36:04,874

00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,499
Don't drive too fast, I'm scared.

532
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:37,707
A pump.

533
00:36:38,499 --> 00:36:39,457
Wait,

00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,041
It's so late, don't be.

541
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:54,707
You shouldn't brought that much of food.

542
00:36:54,707 --> 00:36:56,707
You must be Mr. Wong.

543
00:36:56,707 --> 00:36:58,416

Your sister is very pretty.

552
00:37:13,707 --> 00:37:15,249
Come in and sit down.

553
00:37:18,957 --> 00:37:22,374
Don't drink too much.

554
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:23,874
Otherwise you'll said I've make you crazy again.

555
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:25,124
I know.

556
00:37:25,916 --> 00:37:26,832
You just take a seat.

557
00:37:26,832 --> 00:37:27,791
I go to prepare the food.

558
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:29,707

559
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:32,332
Ah Kao, come and help me.

560
00:37:32,332 --> 00:37:34,791
Alright, I'm coming.

561
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,499
Eat it, it's very sweet.

562
00:37:36,499 --> 00:37:37,457
Poor uncle,

563
00:37:37,457 --> 00:37:39,249
how can he suffer this for one ten years.

564
00:37:40,207 --> 00:37:45,082
Which woman would stay here with me all her life?

565
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:47,707
I have nothing lose.

566
00:37:47,874 --> 00:37:49,166
Why not come in?

567
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,166
Coming.

568
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:51,707
Uncle, let's go,

569
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:53,582
Come on.

570
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:00,957
Sit down.

571
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:02,249
I'll go and get the dishes.

572
00:38:02,249 --> 00:38:03,166
Parkman, have some beer.

573
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:04,332
Good, thank you.

574
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:06,416
Cheers.

575
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:19,582
Thank you, I serve myself.

576
00:38:19,582 --> 00:38:22,457
You are so polite, try some more.

577
00:38:22,457 --> 00:38:25,624
You will not have so much to eat in England.

578
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:27,499
What? You are going to England.

579
00:38:27,499 --> 00:38:29,207
Yes. I go to further my study.

580
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,832
Your brother have a good plan on you.

581
00:38:31,832 --> 00:38:33,416
Her brother loves her so much.

582
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:34,624
When will you go?

583
00:38:34,624 --> 00:38:36,166
When all the document are ready.

584
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:38,666
It's so cold in London,

585
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:41,082
bring more clothes with you.

586
00:38:41,624 --> 00:38:45,207
Electrical appliances are so expensive in England.

587
00:38:45,249 --> 00:38:50,707
You must bring tape recorder, radio,

588
00:38:50,707 --> 00:38:54,332
Hair dryer, ironer, etc. with you.

589
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:15,291
Parkman.

590
00:39:15,707 --> 00:39:16,999
Let's go to see the Hung Ming Lantern.

591
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:19,582
Come and sit down.

592
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:26,541
What's the matter?

593
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:32,207
My sister is too young to look after herself.

594
00:39:32,207 --> 00:39:33,332
I'm worrying.

595
00:39:33,332 --> 00:39:34,707
Take it easy,

596
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:36,457
I've many friends in Chinatown.

597
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,457
I can ask them

598
00:39:37,457 --> 00:39:39,749
to take care of her.

599
00:39:39,749 --> 00:39:41,332
She can get a part time job

600
00:39:41,332 --> 00:39:42,124
if she wants to.

601
00:39:42,124 --> 00:39:43,457
How about that?

602
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,832
Oh, it's great.

603
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:52,624
There's a lot of money to be spent.

604
00:39:56,166 --> 00:40:00,124
I've ten thousand dollars, just take it.

605
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,082
Do you trust me?

606
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:09,166
Surely I do trust my best friend.

607
00:40:19,957 --> 00:40:21,374
Anything better?

608
00:40:21,874 --> 00:40:23,166
Let's discuss it.

609
00:40:34,374 --> 00:40:35,332
Miss.

610
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:38,707
Are you calling me?

611
00:40:41,332 --> 00:40:44,707
Yes. Where's the North Sea Fishing Village please?

612
00:40:44,707 --> 00:40:45,582
It's over there.

613
00:40:45,582 --> 00:40:47,749
Oh! It's over there, I have walked pass.

614
00:40:47,749 --> 00:40:53,291
Miss, I think I have seen you before.

615
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:55,124
I seem to know you.

616
00:40:57,957 --> 00:40:58,999
You're so pretty.

617
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,249
Where's the key?

618
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:02,582
I couldn't find it!

619
00:41:02,582 --> 00:41:03,582
Think it again.

620
00:41:03,624 --> 00:41:05,166
I searched everywhere.

621
00:41:06,582 --> 00:41:10,374
He wants to have an affair with my girlfriend.

622
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:13,166
Miss, is there anyone can park my car?

623
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:15,082
Yes, Ah Wing.

624
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:16,916
Mr. Yang. What's the matter?

625
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,041
The key is in the car.

626
00:41:18,041 --> 00:41:19,041
OK.

627
00:41:20,457 --> 00:41:23,791
Call me when you want to change your job.

628
00:41:24,207 --> 00:41:26,041
It's a waste that you work here.

629
00:41:30,957 --> 00:41:31,957
See you next time.

630
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:33,041
You are welcome.

631
00:41:34,624 --> 00:41:35,332
What did he say?

632
00:41:35,332 --> 00:41:38,291
He said your ugly face, like a thief.

633
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:42,707
Yes, I look a thief, but I've a warm heart.

634
00:41:42,707 --> 00:41:44,832
He owes a Benz and have a black heart.

635
00:41:46,624 --> 00:41:48,582
Will you go to see the mid-night movie with me?

636
00:41:48,582 --> 00:41:50,874
I don't have time.

637
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:54,624
You were talking to that guy for long time!

638
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:59,249
He's so gentle, you, behave like thief.

639
00:42:06,832 --> 00:42:12,166
What are you looking at? I like a thief?

640
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:15,624
Ok.

641
00:42:23,957 --> 00:42:25,999
They decorated their counter.

642
00:42:25,999 --> 00:42:27,082
Should we follow them?

643
00:42:27,082 --> 00:42:31,999
Do you think this will come more money?

644
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:34,999
Don't say that, look, it's different.

645
00:42:35,082 --> 00:42:35,749
Hello!

646
00:42:35,749 --> 00:42:36,916
Don't bother.

647
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,707
Ho, take Mr. Yang's car to repair.

648
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:18,332
Thanks.

649
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:30,457
Hello.

650
00:43:30,457 --> 00:43:33,124
Mr. Yang. This is the management office,
someone drove your car away.

651
00:43:33,124 --> 00:43:33,666
Car?

652
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:34,999
He said take it to repair.

653
00:43:34,999 --> 00:43:36,207
Repair?

654
00:43:59,374 --> 00:44:00,332
Dummy.

655
00:44:00,832 --> 00:44:01,916
What are you doing?

656
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:06,499
Is you? I meet you everywhere I come.

657
00:44:06,499 --> 00:44:11,041
Come on, take what you want.

658
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:13,374
Don't you afraid that I'm the undercover.

659
00:44:13,374 --> 00:44:16,874
In my place? I'll kill you if you dare.

660
00:44:16,874 --> 00:44:18,916
Just kidding.

661
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:20,666
Whose car is it?

662
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:21,999
The fucking small mind,

663
00:44:21,999 --> 00:44:25,207
mean, nasty hypocrite.

664
00:44:25,207 --> 00:44:26,541
He said I look like thief.

665
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:28,082
Do I look like a thief?

666
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,457
No, not at all.

667
00:44:32,499 --> 00:44:34,124
You steal things at the place you work.

668
00:44:34,124 --> 00:44:35,166
Don't you afraid be arrested?

669
00:44:35,166 --> 00:44:38,207
Surely not, I will burn this car tonight.

670
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:42,166
Oh no! Dummy, what a waste? It's a Benz.

671
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:44,624
Take it if you like.

672
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:46,082
I don't think this is a good idea.

673
00:44:46,082 --> 00:44:50,416
Don't worry, don't leave your finger prints.

674
00:44:50,416 --> 00:44:54,457
Or destroy if you like, here's the key.

675
00:44:54,582 --> 00:44:55,874
Take it.

676
00:44:55,874 --> 00:44:57,999
Bastard, call me "Thief".

677
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:07,707
Stanley,

678
00:45:07,707 --> 00:45:09,207
Officer Lau, I'm sorry to keep you wait.

679
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,291
No problem.

680
00:45:10,832 --> 00:45:11,749
I have cleaned the car.

681
00:45:11,749 --> 00:45:13,416
That's already.

682
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:16,124
We're friends.

683
00:45:16,541 --> 00:45:17,874
Just take it.

684
00:45:17,874 --> 00:45:18,624
Thank you, sir.

685
00:45:18,624 --> 00:45:20,291
Let's get on to the car.

686
00:45:23,916 --> 00:45:24,874
Bye.

687
00:45:28,957 --> 00:45:33,207
He is not small mind, see twenty dollars tips.

688
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:47,207
Get out, goblin, dare to seduce my husband.

689
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:48,249
You are crazy.

690
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:48,707
Please don't.

691
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:49,832
Let me go.

692
00:45:49,832 --> 00:45:50,791
Calm down.

693
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:51,749
Go away!

694
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:52,957
Still want to go?

695
00:45:52,957 --> 00:45:54,041
What's the matter?

696
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,207
Cheap thing!

697
00:45:55,624 --> 00:45:56,332
Poor me.

698
00:45:56,332 --> 00:45:57,416
Damn!

699
00:45:57,416 --> 00:45:58,541
Go home and talk about it.

700
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:01,332
Let's go.

701
00:46:02,041 --> 00:46:03,291
Be careful.

702
00:47:14,124 --> 00:47:15,832
Go for a drive with me.

703
00:47:22,582 --> 00:47:23,791
Who drove this car away?

704
00:47:23,999 --> 00:47:26,166
Parkman is great, took the woman away.

705
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:27,749
Isn't he smart.

706
00:47:27,749 --> 00:47:29,832
He's been waiting for this to come.

707
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:31,874
Gigi came to look you.

708
00:47:31,874 --> 00:47:32,624
Is she?

709
00:47:32,624 --> 00:47:33,291
Yes.

710
00:47:33,582 --> 00:47:37,999
I'll go and find that nymphomaniac.

711
00:47:38,332 --> 00:47:39,457
Have some fun, what's the number?

712
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:40,916
O.K. I put you through.

713
00:47:42,249 --> 00:47:44,707
Gigi, I want to go for a drive with you.

714
00:47:44,749 --> 00:47:46,499
I borrow a Benz from someone.

715
00:47:47,082 --> 00:47:51,332
I use Benz every day, the worse is this car.

716
00:47:51,957 --> 00:47:53,832
Don't be pink.

717
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:56,582
You have big meals for too long.

718
00:47:58,249 --> 00:48:00,541
Sometime I saw those guests you entertain.

719
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:03,332
They're old and ugly, how can you do it?

720
00:48:03,541 --> 00:48:06,791
I just image I'm doing aerobic dance.

721
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:10,207
One more, two more, three more,

722
00:48:10,749 --> 00:48:11,707
that's it.

723
00:48:12,249 --> 00:48:15,416
Some of them even had no teeth left do it.

724
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:18,249
Be faith to your occupation.

725
00:48:24,332 --> 00:48:25,541
What happen?

726
00:48:25,749 --> 00:48:29,874
Did you get her name?
It's your fault, the tie is broken.

727
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:06,624
Have you finish, it's dawn now.

728
00:49:09,624 --> 00:49:12,749
Shit, don't even have spare tie.

729
00:49:13,707 --> 00:49:14,999
Get a taxi.

730
00:49:14,999 --> 00:49:18,666
No, this is somebody's car,
I have to return it.

731
00:49:18,666 --> 00:49:20,124
What should we do then?

732
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,707
Can you help me to push the car?

733
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:25,791
What? Ask me to push the car?

734
00:49:26,999 --> 00:49:30,582
You go home now, I'll call you tomorrow.

735
00:49:30,582 --> 00:49:32,832
Be a good girl OK?

736
00:49:33,999 --> 00:49:36,291
You are crazy, you asked me to come out.

737
00:49:36,291 --> 00:49:38,082
Don't ever call me again.

738
00:49:39,082 --> 00:49:40,124
Taxi.

739
00:49:48,166 --> 00:49:52,249
Nymphomaniac, go away,
don't make me feel boring.

740
00:51:06,707 --> 00:51:08,124
You cannot die.

741
00:51:10,666 --> 00:51:13,374
I won't. I enjoy the life.

742
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:48,416
Come to my place.

743
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:38,624
Why are you still there?

744
00:53:40,999 --> 00:53:41,957
Come!

745
00:53:57,582 --> 00:53:58,666
Stella.

746
00:53:58,666 --> 00:53:59,666
What's the matter?

747
00:53:59,999 --> 00:54:01,749
I apologize for tonight.

748
00:54:02,291 --> 00:54:04,791
My wife is a bit over react.

749
00:54:04,791 --> 00:54:06,916
I know. She will come back to me.

750
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:08,749
Forget about it.

751
00:54:08,749 --> 00:54:09,916
What are you doing here?

752
00:54:10,541 --> 00:54:11,791
Making love.

753
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,416
Do you want me to come over here?

754
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:16,541
Can you?

755
00:54:17,332 --> 00:54:18,916
Annie is leaving for L.A. in the morning.

756
00:54:19,416 --> 00:54:20,416
[... don't want...

757
00:54:20,416 --> 00:54:22,332
Anything else?

758
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:25,332
Go to bed early tonight.

759
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:27,582
I am not a kid.

760
00:54:28,499 --> 00:54:30,541
I give you a call tomorrow.

761
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:31,624
I'm sorry,

762
00:54:32,249 --> 00:54:33,291

00:54:34,416 --> 00:54:35,874
Don't ever call me again.

764
00:55:30,832 --> 00:55:32,041
Money! Money!

765
00:55:36,957 --> 00:55:40,916

766
00:55:48,374 --> 00:55:49,416

767
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,749
You want breakfast?

768
00:56:19,749 --> 00:56:20,874
Good morning.

769
00:56:29,791 --> 00:56:33,416
Parkman, I want to speak to you.

770
00:56:34,957 --> 00:56:36,999
You've make a fortune,
don't have to work anymore.

771
00:56:37,416 --> 00:56:39,416
Right, so you can tell?

772
00:56:41,249 --> 00:56:42,916
How much H.K. money can change for US$1?

773
00:56:43,624 --> 00:56:44,707

774
00:56:44,999 --> 00:56:46,124
7.7 something...

775
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:48,041
Why? You had a lot?

Only a few. Have you finish talking?

779
00:56:52,582 --> 00:56:54,457
Do you know where Stella is?

780
00:56:54,707 --> 00:56:55,916
She didn't tell me.

781
00:56:56,582 --> 00:56:58,707
Well, thank you.

782
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:02,082
What's the matter?

783
00:57:02,082 --> 00:57:04,249

785
00:57:05,124 --> 00:57:05,874

I want to spend some money.

792
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:18,707
I want to buy you an expensive dinner.

793
00:57:18,707 --> 00:57:20,291
Forget it.

794
00:57:21,249 --> 00:57:24,416
I will tell you the most important thing
in the world after the dinner.

795
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:27,166
What the hell are you doing?

796
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:31,457
We talk about this afterwards alright?

797
00:57:32,832 --> 00:57:34,832
You want to buy me dinner, right?

798
00:57:34,832 --> 00:57:37,124
I want to eat Japanese food in that Hotel.

799
00:57:38,957 --> 00:57:41,416
You must want to your "Pizza"?

800
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:42,916
Good! You got it.

801
00:57:46,124 --> 00:57:47,541
I've said she will be late.

802
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:48,791
Of course. I know.

803
00:57:50,457 --> 00:57:53,374
She definitely will come. Be patient!

804
00:57:53,374 --> 00:57:57,832
You see. What a beauty.

805
00:58:03,624 --> 00:58:05,582
Mr. Fung, your friend are inside.

806
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,499
Your "Pizza" is here.

807
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:18,499
Sure you don't want to come?

808
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:21,957
Come with friends!

809
00:58:23,707 --> 00:58:25,957
We are sitting over there, come over for a while.

810
00:58:27,374 --> 00:58:28,749
I'll give you a call tonight.

811
00:58:31,832 --> 00:58:33,041
I go in first.

812
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:42,874
Right when I held my purse like this,
you guess what happen?

813
00:58:43,707 --> 00:58:46,874
I was carrying something in my left hand
and Stella in my right arm.

814
00:58:46,874 --> 00:58:49,874
Just like tied up.
In this way my purse was robber.

815
00:58:49,874 --> 00:58:53,791
In Midland, robber is a very serious problem, and

816
00:58:53,832 --> 00:58:59,582
In Italy, those men touched bottom, remember?

817
00:59:00,291 --> 00:59:01,041
Someone touched your bottom?

818
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:03,541
Not touching hers, it's mine!

819
00:59:08,499 --> 00:59:11,707
Stella, I want to have a word with you.

820
00:59:14,249 --> 00:59:16,207
No, I harder know you.

821
00:59:25,249 --> 00:59:26,374
Who's that?

822
00:59:26,791 --> 00:59:29,166
Someone parks car for other people.

823
00:59:33,832 --> 00:59:36,124
Sorry, we don't take U.S Dollars.

824
00:59:36,499 --> 00:59:38,666
It's ridiculous.

825
00:59:38,666 --> 00:59:41,791
This is our company practice,
please use credit card.

826
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:45,499
Man.

827
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,999
They don't accept U.S Dollars.

828
00:59:49,499 --> 00:59:52,916
Is there some tips with you?

829
00:59:53,749 --> 00:59:54,749
How much money?

830
00:59:55,916 --> 00:59:57,624
Thank you. $872.

831
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:00,957

832
01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:03,416
Hundred something Dollars for tips?

833
01:00:04,666 --> 01:00:05,582
Parkman

835
01:00:09,999 --> 01:00:12,291
Pay you back in U.S. Dollars.

836
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:13,791
Please don't.

837
01:00:14,791 --> 01:00:17,249
She said she doesn't know me well.

838
01:00:17,249 --> 01:00:19,499
Actually I want to buy you a bid meal.

839
01:00:19,541 --> 01:00:21,707
Just want to let you being proud of her.

840
01:00:21,707 --> 01:00:23,999
God knows this will happen.

841
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:29,499
May be he's her husband.

842
01:00:29,499 --> 01:00:30,416
It can't be!

843
01:00:30,832 --> 01:00:32,124
How do you know?

844
01:00:32,124 --> 01:00:34,166
There's no made in her place.

845
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:39,832
You must have gone to her place before?

846
01:00:39,832 --> 01:00:41,249
Have made good friend with her, have you?

847
01:00:41,582 --> 01:00:43,082
Who cares who he is,

848
01:00:43,082 --> 01:00:44,374
you have fulfill your plan.

849
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:45,666
What else do you expect?

850
01:00:48,624 --> 01:00:51,707
I tell you a secret.

851
01:00:51,707 --> 01:00:54,457
Guarantee you'll get your share.

852
01:00:54,999 --> 01:00:56,666
Like she don't know me.

853
01:00:57,749 --> 01:01:00,166
Can you listen to me?

854
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:03,166
Last night I drove the Benz Dummy stole.

855
01:01:03,166 --> 01:01:06,582
And went for a drive with Gigi, a tie flatted.

856
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:14,082
Let me finish,
then I tried to find a spare tie.

857
01:01:14,207 --> 01:01:16,291
You guess what I find in the car?

858
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:19,582
US Dollars, I'm going to be rich this time.

859
01:01:19,582 --> 01:01:22,457
Then you stay here and get rich.

860
01:01:24,541 --> 01:01:25,791
Where are you going?

861
01:01:26,707 --> 01:01:28,874
I'm going to find a car.

862
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:32,374
Find what?

863
01:01:32,374 --> 01:01:34,499
We have the US Dollars.

864
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:37,582
It won't be that old man
to have meals with Stella.

865
01:01:37,582 --> 01:01:39,124
It will be you, stupid.

866
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:47,416
Let's go.

867
01:01:48,374 --> 01:01:49,707
What are you doing with all this US money?

868
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:51,749
Change them into HK Dollars with others.

869
01:01:51,957 --> 01:01:55,291
Use HK dollars to get US, and change it
the other way round. Are you crazy?

870
01:01:55,291 --> 01:01:57,416
Make sure those money can be used?

871
01:01:58,291 --> 01:02:01,166
Change it in a hotel means
we'll lose interest, but safe.

872
01:02:01,916 --> 01:02:02,707
It'll be OK.

873
01:02:02,707 --> 01:02:04,416
Nothing to be scare of.

874
01:02:04,832 --> 01:02:06,291
What do you mean wait another second.

875
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:08,707
I'm in here all day now,
come on, what is it?

876
01:02:08,707 --> 01:02:10,874
Mr. I want to change some HK Dollars.

877
01:02:10,874 --> 01:02:11,624
Good.

878
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:16,874
Think about what you want? I'll buy you.

879
01:02:17,124 --> 01:02:17,957
Sorry what,

880
01:02:17,957 --> 01:02:18,957
Man, Come on...

881
01:02:20,749 --> 01:02:22,041
What's wrong with him?

882
01:02:22,041 --> 01:02:24,166
I tell you what to do with your policy, man.

883
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:25,874
Just take your night out of here.

884
01:02:25,874 --> 01:02:28,499
Hey, try this policy one time, man.

885
01:02:28,499 --> 01:02:29,916
Coming now.

886
01:02:33,457 --> 01:02:36,249
Hey, I only got two days in this town, man.

887
01:02:36,291 --> 01:02:37,207
I want my money.

888
01:02:37,207 --> 01:02:37,916
That's him.

889
01:02:37,916 --> 01:02:40,207
Come on, get it over,

890
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:43,916
Excuse me sir, I'm the manager.

891
01:02:44,166 --> 01:02:45,166
Please come with us

892
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:46,082
To the police station.

893
01:02:46,082 --> 01:02:48,666
What do you mean police station.

894
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:49,832
I'm not going to the police station.

895
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:52,082
Mr. I'm not going to change it my money.

896
01:02:52,082 --> 01:02:54,416
Sorry sir, here're two fake banknotes.

897
01:02:54,457 --> 01:02:57,582
Fake banknotes again,

898
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,957
let's go to the police station together.

899
01:03:05,124 --> 01:03:06,166
What's your name?

900
01:03:06,166 --> 01:03:07,207
Lee Wo Sau.

901
01:03:07,207 --> 01:03:08,166
And you?

902
01:03:08,166 --> 01:03:09,249
Wong Park man.

903
01:03:09,624 --> 01:03:10,749
Occupation.

904
01:03:11,499 --> 01:03:12,707
Serving?

905
01:03:12,707 --> 01:03:13,791
Male prostitute?

906
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:17,457
Sergeant, do not be nasty.

907
01:03:17,457 --> 01:03:19,624
Male prostitute is a kind of service.

908
01:03:20,291 --> 01:03:22,332
We park cars for customers in restaurant.

909
01:03:22,416 --> 01:03:26,207
That's car parking, serving job.

910
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:28,791
Be nicely, parking cars is a legal occupation.

911
01:03:30,582 --> 01:03:34,499
How do you find out those are fake banknotes?

912
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:37,707
I'm asking you, not the other way round.

913
01:03:38,707 --> 01:03:39,957
Who's money is this?

914
01:03:40,874 --> 01:03:41,832
Mine.

915
01:03:42,416 --> 01:03:43,707
Where did you get it?

916
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:46,124
Given by a customer, it's tips.

917
01:03:46,749 --> 01:03:50,082
He's so generous, Twenty US for tips.

918
01:03:50,166 --> 01:03:52,124
Sergeant, we are innocent.

01:03:52,124 --> 01:03:53,791
All the tips are put together.

920
01:03:53,791 --> 01:03:54,624
Who knows they are real or false?

921
01:03:54,624 --> 01:03:55,541
It's the two of you.

922
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:56,957
Officer Lau.

923
01:03:57,541 --> 01:03:58,666
Sir, how do you know them?

924
01:03:58,666 --> 01:03:59,291

925
01:03:59,291 --> 01:04:02,249
They park car for me, how many fake one?

926
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:05,082
Two.

927
01:04:05,416 --> 01:04:08,291
Officer Lau, you know we are not baddy.

928
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:09,749
I don't like a police too.

929
01:04:09,749 --> 01:04:13,624
Even someone likes a thief,
he needs not to be one.

930
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:16,999
Put them down in record, let them go.

931
01:04:16,999 --> 01:04:19,874
They have legal occupation, don't make a fuss.

932
01:04:19,874 --> 01:04:20,832
Yes sir.

933
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:24,041
There's a lot of false money nowadays,
be careful.

934
01:04:24,041 --> 01:04:25,666
Thank you.

935
01:04:26,832 --> 01:04:29,582
Mr. Lee. Please tell me from beginning again.

936
01:04:33,499 --> 01:04:34,791
What's wrong?

937
01:04:34,874 --> 01:04:35,749
You hear that,

938
01:04:35,749 --> 01:04:37,499
even the police scold us.

939
01:04:37,499 --> 01:04:38,582
I quit.

940
01:04:38,582 --> 01:04:41,624
Quit. If it's real money?

941
01:04:41,624 --> 01:04:42,874
I quit too.

942
01:04:42,874 --> 01:04:44,207
What you still have a lot?

943
01:04:44,541 --> 01:04:47,582
More than one million, all brand new.

944
01:04:47,582 --> 01:04:49,291
Why didn't you tell me earlier.

945
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:54,124
You didn't ask, it's more than ten million HK.

946
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:56,041
But we have nothing now.

947
01:04:59,624 --> 01:05:04,416
It was fine before without you.

948
01:05:04,416 --> 01:05:07,582
You suggested to change uniforms,

949
01:05:07,582 --> 01:05:09,749
smile to the clients, so what?

950
01:05:09,749 --> 01:05:12,624
People still calling us parking.

951
01:05:12,624 --> 01:05:16,416
Last time we went for the Japanese food,

952
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:18,791
You don't have enough money to pay.

953
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:22,332
Ask me to change the money with you,

954
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:25,874
you want me to go jail with you.

955
01:05:27,499 --> 01:05:29,082
Don't ever try to cheat me.

956
01:06:01,416 --> 01:06:03,666
Stella, I have something to say to you.

957
01:06:03,749 --> 01:06:04,999
Nothing to say.

958
01:06:07,041 --> 01:06:10,207
Stella, open the door.

959
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:15,124
Do you want the neighbour to hear this?

960
01:06:20,791 --> 01:06:22,582
I want to make it clear with you.

961
01:06:23,332 --> 01:06:24,832
Let me go,

962
01:06:24,832 --> 01:06:27,749
I don't want to see you, go.

963
01:06:31,999 --> 01:06:33,874
I'll call the police.

964
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:39,082
Stella!

965
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:43,582
Stella!

966
01:06:50,916 --> 01:06:52,791
You love me,

967
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:54,832
otherwise you wouldn't bring me here.

968
01:06:54,832 --> 01:06:56,707
I don't know what you are talking about.

969
01:06:58,124 --> 01:06:59,374
I love you.

970
01:06:59,374 --> 01:07:00,457
So what?

971
01:07:02,707 --> 01:07:03,999
I want to be with you,

972
01:07:03,999 --> 01:07:05,666
I'll make you happy.

973
01:07:07,249 --> 01:07:08,416
It can't be done.

974
01:07:09,582 --> 01:07:10,957
I need you.

975
01:07:10,957 --> 01:07:12,541
I don't need you.

976
01:07:12,541 --> 01:07:13,707
Why?

977
01:07:14,332 --> 01:07:16,791
Stella, pass me the plastic and medicine.

978
01:07:16,791 --> 01:07:18,166
You're still staying with him.

979
01:07:18,749 --> 01:07:20,207
None of your business,

980
01:07:44,416 --> 01:07:45,249
what are you doing here?

981
01:07:45,249 --> 01:07:46,791
If you can come, either me.

982
01:07:47,374 --> 01:07:51,624
This is my place, everything are mine.

983
01:07:56,332 --> 01:07:58,707
You wet my floor.

984
01:08:11,082 --> 01:08:12,791
Tell him to go.

985
01:08:25,124 --> 01:08:26,041
It's OK,

986
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:29,166
I'll go.

987
01:09:39,124 --> 01:09:41,874
Dry yourself first.

988
01:09:44,082 --> 01:09:45,999
You were there?

989
01:09:45,999 --> 01:09:48,166
I'm sure it's finished.

990
01:09:48,874 --> 01:09:51,124
Otherwise you won't be here.

991
01:09:58,082 --> 01:09:59,249
You are right.

992
01:09:59,999 --> 01:10:01,916
I've told you before,

993
01:10:01,916 --> 01:10:04,874
he has a Benz, a rich man.

994
01:10:06,332 --> 01:10:10,082
Like you, how can you win?

995
01:10:12,749 --> 01:10:15,916
I have the right to chase after her.

996
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:18,124
She's not married, why can't 1?

997
01:10:18,124 --> 01:10:19,124
You can,

998
01:10:20,291 --> 01:10:22,249
but look at yourself.

999
01:10:22,707 --> 01:10:27,332
You have nothing to back you up.

1000
01:10:27,332 --> 01:10:29,832
No power, no money,

1001
01:10:30,707 --> 01:10:32,249
if these are real.

1002
01:10:32,249 --> 01:10:33,957
You can do it then..

1003
01:10:37,291 --> 01:10:38,832
She knows I have no money.

1004
01:10:39,207 --> 01:10:43,457
Some women only playing with men.

1005
01:10:43,457 --> 01:10:44,499
Men can use women,

1006
01:10:44,499 --> 01:10:46,874
why can't they?

1007
01:10:46,874 --> 01:10:51,791
I've warned you before.

1008
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:54,249
She does like a Rolls Royce,

1009
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:58,041
you can afford neither gasoline fee.
More license fee,

1010
01:10:59,832 --> 01:11:01,291
why can't you treat her as a stealing car.

1011
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:02,999
Once only.

1012
01:11:03,999 --> 01:11:05,082
I can't take it.

1013
01:11:05,082 --> 01:11:06,957
What?

1014
01:11:06,957 --> 01:11:08,541
Then I should cut my throat.

1015
01:11:09,749 --> 01:11:14,291
At least you've happy time with her.

1016
01:11:15,082 --> 01:11:17,999
And me? I've few hundred thousand US Dollars.

1017
01:11:17,999 --> 01:11:21,416
I've spent not even one note,
I'm supposed to be rich.

1018
01:11:22,041 --> 01:11:25,082
If you can't take it, alright.

1019
01:11:25,082 --> 01:11:28,624
I give you all the money,

1020
01:11:28,624 --> 01:11:30,291
take them with you to Stella.

1021
01:11:30,291 --> 01:11:33,457
Throw all on her them, foolish.

1022
01:11:41,582 --> 01:11:43,291
Where did you get that much of money?

1023
01:11:45,332 --> 01:11:47,082
Uncle, these are wall paper.

1024
01:11:47,082 --> 01:11:52,749
Wall paper? Are you trying to cheat me?

1025
01:11:52,749 --> 01:11:56,791
Where did you get them from? Tell me.

1026
01:11:57,332 --> 01:11:59,207
These are all false money.

1027
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:03,874
False? Then why you stick them all on the wall?

1028
01:12:03,874 --> 01:12:05,499
Do you want to put me in the shit?

1029
01:12:05,499 --> 01:12:08,457
A lot of policemen walk pass here.

1030
01:12:08,457 --> 01:12:11,624
If they find these, they will put me in the jail!

1031
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:14,874
Where did you get them?

1032
01:12:17,707 --> 01:12:18,999
I picked them up.

1033
01:12:19,082 --> 01:12:23,832
So you think it's alright?

1034
01:12:24,041 --> 01:12:28,207
If they find them.
They might think you printed the money,

1035
01:12:28,207 --> 01:12:30,249
then you will really be in big trouble.

1036
01:12:31,582 --> 01:12:33,291
I can't imagine what will happen

1037
01:12:33,291 --> 01:12:35,707
if these are real.

1038
01:12:37,541 --> 01:12:41,707
Uncle, you won't say that

1039
01:12:41,707 --> 01:12:43,249
if these are real money.

1040
01:12:43,249 --> 01:12:47,666
I want to buy you and Auntie a nice house.

1041
01:12:48,999 --> 01:12:55,374
I know the house with
iron bar all around. Secure.

1042
01:12:55,374 --> 01:12:56,999
That will be the Hotel Prison.

1043
01:12:56,999 --> 01:13:01,291
Do you want to put us to the jail
for the rest of our life?

1044
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:04,874
Listen to me,

1045
01:13:04,874 --> 01:13:08,374
you gotta to believe the fortunes wheel!

1046
01:13:08,832 --> 01:13:10,499
Easy come easy go,

1047
01:13:10,499 --> 01:13:12,707
if you want to be rich.

1048
01:13:13,707 --> 01:13:17,124
You should use your brain and work hard.

1049
01:13:17,124 --> 01:13:20,082
You can't just sit and wait for the money.

1050
01:13:23,916 --> 01:13:28,541
Go to bed now, start the new life tomorrow.

1051
01:13:30,666 --> 01:13:33,499
Burn all the money,

1052
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:41,499
are they real or false?

1053
01:13:44,707 --> 01:13:45,957
What a pity.

1054
01:13:59,041 --> 01:13:59,582
Take the car.

1055
01:13:59,582 --> 01:13:59,999
Yes.

1056
01:13:59,999 --> 01:14:00,874
It's coming.

1057
01:14:00,874 --> 01:14:01,791
Why take so long?

1058
01:14:01,791 --> 01:14:02,874
Here comes the car.

1059
01:14:02,957 --> 01:14:05,374
It's coming, did you have your meal yet?

1060
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:06,499
Yes, I did.

1061
01:14:07,374 --> 01:14:08,082
Are you busy?

1062
01:14:08,082 --> 01:14:09,249
Not really.

1063
01:14:11,332 --> 01:14:12,207
Mr. Lam.

1064
01:14:12,249 --> 01:14:13,749
Thank you, bye.

1065
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:20,249
What's the matter, come over here.

1066
01:14:20,332 --> 01:14:21,082
Come and see the car.

1067
01:14:21,082 --> 01:14:21,832
What's wrong?

1068
01:14:22,207 --> 01:14:23,916
What have you done, I asked you to park the car.

1069
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:24,666
And the door is gone.

1070
01:14:24,666 --> 01:14:25,874
I don't know why, I parked it at the car park.

1071
01:14:25,874 --> 01:14:27,082
What?

1072
01:14:27,499 --> 01:14:29,499
I want to talk to your manager.

1073
01:14:29,499 --> 01:14:30,541
Shit!

1074
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:32,666
So what should we do now?

1075
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:36,666
The door is gone when I went to get the car.

1076
01:14:36,666 --> 01:14:38,707
How come?

1077
01:14:40,457 --> 01:14:41,666
Very possible...

1078
01:14:41,666 --> 01:14:42,707
Nice!

1079
01:14:42,707 --> 01:14:44,332
Exactly the same as the original.

1080
01:14:44,332 --> 01:14:45,166
Of course,

1081
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:47,499
I promised you.

1082
01:14:47,499 --> 01:14:51,499
Still you have to pay the money you owe me.

1083
01:14:51,499 --> 01:14:52,666
Will do.

1084
01:14:52,666 --> 01:14:54,874
I left my car with them and went to have my meal.

1085
01:14:54,874 --> 01:14:56,374
Now how can I drive without the door.

1086
01:14:56,374 --> 01:14:57,624
I'm so sorry, this is an accident,

1087
01:14:57,624 --> 01:14:58,749
but it is very trouble to report
to the police station.

1088
01:14:58,749 --> 01:15:01,166
Trouble. I'm in trouble without a car.

1089
01:15:01,166 --> 01:15:02,207
I'm so sorry,

1090
01:15:02,249 --> 01:15:04,541
although this is not our responsibility.

1091
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:05,999
I do know you very well.

1092
01:15:05,999 --> 01:15:07,582
I don't want to lose the client like you.

1093
01:15:07,582 --> 01:15:11,082
Stop explain,
let me know when it's been fixed.

1094
01:15:11,082 --> 01:15:12,666
Yes, I will do that, I'm so sorry.

1095
01:15:17,749 --> 01:15:19,332
I thought you work hard,

1096
01:15:19,332 --> 01:15:22,332
change the uniforms and lighting.

1097
01:15:22,332 --> 01:15:25,666
How did you park the car and the door is gone.

1098
01:15:27,332 --> 01:15:29,291
Mr. Chow, surely this is a trap.

1099
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:32,666
Shut up, this is a famous seafood restaurant.

1100
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:35,832
We are running a big business,

1101
01:15:35,832 --> 01:15:37,291
if you are so careless.

1102
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:39,666
The clients won't come anymore, in this case.

1103
01:15:39,666 --> 01:15:41,499
I'll cease the parking service.

1104
01:15:41,499 --> 01:15:42,874
Mr. Chow, don't be like that.

1105
01:15:42,874 --> 01:15:45,832
Get the car to fix.

1106
01:15:47,457 --> 01:15:49,374
Put the bill in you two's account.

1107
01:15:51,957 --> 01:15:53,332
Damn it!

1108
01:15:56,041 --> 01:15:57,166
What should we do now?

1109
01:15:57,624 --> 01:15:59,749
We've a commitment before,

1110
01:15:59,749 --> 01:16:01,916
how can they do this.

1111
01:16:02,749 --> 01:16:04,832
We might lose our jobs.

1112
01:16:05,707 --> 01:16:08,749
We have to do something.

1113
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:35,249
Hello.

1114
01:16:35,541 --> 01:16:37,791

1115
01:16:37,791 --> 01:16:39,874
and we know who you are.

1116
01:16:39,874 --> 01:16:40,582
Who are you?

1117
01:16:40,582 --> 01:16:43,249
You don't need to know, Dummy,

1118
01:16:43,624 --> 01:16:45,166
we all work for the money.

1119
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:49,666
I'll pay you $200,000 to get the car back.

1120
01:16:49,749 --> 01:16:55,207

1122
01:16:57,957 --> 01:17:00,291
Hello...

1124
01:17:25,541 --> 01:17:27,457

1125
01:17:27,624 --> 01:17:30,582


1126
01:17:32,499 --> 01:17:33,624
Phone call.

1127
01:17:38,166 --> 01:17:39,874
Mr. Yang Tsit Hong.

1128
01:17:39,874 --> 01:17:41,207
Speaking, who is it?

1129
01:17:41,207 --> 01:17:43,749
Are you the owner of DA12507

1130
01:17:43,957 --> 01:17:45,874
Papa, come to sing the birthday song.

1131
01:17:45,874 --> 01:17:47,791
OK. Won't be long.

1132
01:17:48,082 --> 01:17:49,041
Come on.

1133
01:17:49,499 --> 01:17:53,124
Your car has been stolen,
but you didn't report to the police station.

1134
01:17:54,999 --> 01:17:55,957
Who are you?

1135
01:17:55,957 --> 01:17:59,999
Do you want your stuff back?

1136
01:18:01,749 --> 01:18:03,291
I don't know what are you talking about.

1137
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:05,374
Don't pretend innocent.

1138
01:18:05,374 --> 01:18:07,457
I'm calling you

1139
01:18:07,957 --> 01:18:09,874
because I want you

1140
01:18:10,374 --> 01:18:13,957
to pay to get your car back.

1141
01:18:14,124 --> 01:18:15,541
You know what I mean.

1142
01:18:16,416 --> 01:18:17,124
What do you want?

1143
01:18:17,124 --> 01:18:19,832
I'm only a small potato.

1144
01:18:20,332 --> 01:18:23,791
You are famous person in this town.

1145
01:18:23,791 --> 01:18:26,166
If I tell the true to the public...

1146
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:30,041
Alright, what is the term?

1147
01:18:30,957 --> 01:18:33,416
Listen, tomorrow 14:00 hours

1148
01:18:33,416 --> 01:18:38,041
bring $200,000 cash along.

1149
01:18:38,041 --> 01:18:41,041
To the top floor of Middle Road car park.

1150
01:18:41,374 --> 01:18:43,541
How can I recognize is you?

1151
01:18:43,541 --> 01:18:45,707
We'll drive a silver gray Toyota.

1152
01:18:45,707 --> 01:18:47,332
You can recognize the car.

1153
01:18:47,499 --> 01:18:50,416
I don't have that much cash with me.

1154
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:56,041
Papa, come to have some food.

1155
01:18:56,291 --> 01:18:57,916
OK.

1156
01:19:02,332 --> 01:19:04,457
We scared him.

1157
01:19:07,082 --> 01:19:09,249
Dummy is back, do you think he finds the money?

1158
01:19:16,999 --> 01:19:20,541
What is your name? What should I call you?

1159
01:19:20,541 --> 01:19:21,749
Listen,

1160
01:19:21,749 --> 01:19:24,207
we want to change our plan.

1161
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:25,541
Wait a minute,

1162
01:19:25,541 --> 01:19:27,499
it doesn't worth for $200,000.

1163
01:19:27,499 --> 01:19:29,124
You want to do a loss deal with me?

1164
01:19:29,124 --> 01:19:33,124
Just do what I say.

1165
01:19:33,124 --> 01:19:34,541
Tomorrow afternoon 14:00 hours

1166
01:19:34,541 --> 01:19:37,541
at the top floor of Middle Road car park.

1167
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:41,582
Come with the Toyota in time,
by your own self.

1168
01:19:41,582 --> 01:19:44,832
By my own self? How can I trust you?

1169
01:19:45,124 --> 01:19:50,041
We intend to pay $200,000 to change the car.

1170
01:19:50,041 --> 01:19:51,832
Because we want to keep this as a secret.

1171
01:19:51,832 --> 01:19:56,249
I found something in the car.

1172
01:19:56,249 --> 01:19:57,541
You know what I mean.

1173
01:19:57,582 --> 01:20:01,999
Those US notes are fake, they're useless to you.

1174
01:20:02,041 --> 01:20:06,166
Come tomorrow if you're clever enough.

1175
01:20:07,374 --> 01:20:08,582
False money?

1176
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:15,374
Will he come?

1177
01:20:15,374 --> 01:20:18,082
Definitely.

1178
01:20:18,624 --> 01:20:19,457
Look at him,

1179
01:20:19,457 --> 01:20:21,999
he still holding the money.

1180
01:20:22,374 --> 01:20:24,791
Wait for Lau comes for meal

1181
01:20:24,791 --> 01:20:26,249
as our schedule.

1182
01:20:58,666 --> 01:21:00,749
Officer Lau is inside already.

1183
01:21:01,332 --> 01:21:03,332
Time is not up yet.

1184
01:21:24,166 --> 01:21:25,249
Mr. Yang's car is coming.

1185
01:21:25,249 --> 01:21:26,207
I got it.

1186
01:21:26,499 --> 01:21:27,707
Go to drive that car.

1187
01:21:27,707 --> 01:21:28,874
Don't forget to change your clothes.

1188
01:21:55,707 --> 01:21:56,457
Dummy is coming.

1189
01:21:56,457 --> 01:21:57,957
OK. Action!

1190
01:22:06,582 --> 01:22:07,832
Officer Lau,

1191
01:22:08,749 --> 01:22:09,749
someone is stealing your car.

1192
01:22:09,749 --> 01:22:10,457
Stealing my car?

1193
01:22:10,457 --> 01:22:11,249
Yes.

1194
01:22:12,916 --> 01:22:14,207
Who's stealing my car?

1195
01:22:14,207 --> 01:22:15,291
He's getting the tools

1196
01:22:15,291 --> 01:22:16,499
at the car park.

1197
01:22:22,874 --> 01:22:23,999
I have a car,

1198
01:22:23,999 --> 01:22:25,332
let's go to chase him.

1199
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:26,749
Whose car is it?

1200
01:22:26,749 --> 01:22:28,666
It's OK, I get on to the car.

1201
01:22:49,916 --> 01:22:51,166
Quick, chase him.

1202
01:22:51,582 --> 01:22:55,041
I know, that is red traffic signal.

1203
01:22:55,499 --> 01:22:58,082
Foolish, Police chase thief.

1204
01:23:34,082 --> 01:23:36,541
This car made in 1974,

1205
01:23:36,541 --> 01:23:38,249
your car made in 1985.

1206
01:23:38,249 --> 01:23:41,124
Eleven years difference, I'll try my best.

1207
01:23:41,124 --> 01:23:43,207
It's turning, let's follow him.

1208
01:23:54,374 --> 01:23:55,541
What's the matter? What's wrong?

1209
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:57,457
Oh, my god! No gasoline.

1210
01:23:57,457 --> 01:23:58,166
What?

1211
01:24:00,374 --> 01:24:01,457
How can it be like this?

1212
01:24:01,457 --> 01:24:03,249
I forget to fill it up.

1213
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:07,291
What should we do then?

1214
01:24:09,082 --> 01:24:11,291
Stop! Stop!

1215
01:24:20,332 --> 01:24:22,791
That's my car, my car.

1216
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:23,457
So what are we going to do now?

1217
01:24:23,457 --> 01:24:24,041
Stop!

1218
01:24:24,041 --> 01:24:25,791
Don't step out, no wait here.

1219
01:24:25,791 --> 01:24:27,582
Stanley, where do you go?

1220
01:24:27,999 --> 01:24:29,499
Officer Lau, we find the helper.

1221
01:24:30,082 --> 01:24:31,457
Get on to the car, quick.

1222
01:24:32,749 --> 01:24:34,749
Did you see the no waiting sign.

1223
01:24:34,749 --> 01:24:36,291
I'm the police, I order you to chase that car.

1224
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:38,541
Good, I can drive like an express car,

1225
01:24:38,999 --> 01:24:40,082
Quick.

1226
01:24:40,082 --> 01:24:41,041
What's going on?

1227
01:24:41,041 --> 01:24:43,749
Someone is stealing his car, there it is.

1228
01:24:44,207 --> 01:24:46,166
Fantastic.

1229
01:24:46,457 --> 01:24:48,582
Sir, which one is yours.

1230
01:24:48,582 --> 01:24:50,707
The one is turning now, number 1001.

1231
01:25:04,832 --> 01:25:06,499
Why do you think I am?

1232
01:25:07,749 --> 01:25:09,916
Are you blind?

1233
01:25:10,166 --> 01:25:11,624
Call the control center,

1234
01:25:11,666 --> 01:25:13,416
chase that car. Go.

1235
01:25:18,541 --> 01:25:19,541
Calling control,

1236
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:22,457
a silver gray private car
license NO. CE1001.

1237
01:25:27,416 --> 01:25:29,499
Sit a bit far from me please.

1238
01:25:30,874 --> 01:25:31,999
Alright.

1239
01:25:34,957 --> 01:25:37,249
Come in and chase that car,

1240
01:25:44,207 --> 01:25:44,874
Move faster.

1241
01:25:44,874 --> 01:25:45,999
It's the highest speed.

1242
01:25:46,832 --> 01:25:47,374
Faster.

1243
01:25:47,416 --> 01:25:50,082
This monthly ticket is expired.

1244
01:25:50,124 --> 01:25:51,457
Don't block the way.

1245
01:25:51,499 --> 01:25:53,499
This car goes up just like that?

1246
01:26:01,541 --> 01:26:03,041
You report to control, others come with me.

1247
01:26:03,041 --> 01:26:04,082
Quick!

1248
01:26:05,582 --> 01:26:06,541
Quick!

1249
01:26:06,874 --> 01:26:07,916
You go this way, I go that way.

1250
01:26:07,916 --> 01:26:09,374
Yes sir, follow me.

1251
01:26:23,832 --> 01:26:25,749
Report control, we are now at
the Middle Road car park, over.

1252
01:26:25,749 --> 01:26:27,916
So many policemen and police cars.

1253
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:29,457
How can you drive like that?

1254
01:26:29,457 --> 01:26:30,457
I'm chasing the thief.

1255
01:26:30,457 --> 01:26:33,082
How can you knock my car and gone.

1256
01:26:33,082 --> 01:26:34,082
Shut up and leave here immediately.

1257
01:27:02,291 --> 01:27:03,499
Stay, don't go.

1258
01:27:50,749 --> 01:27:52,291
Stay, don't go.

1259
01:27:52,457 --> 01:27:54,499
Stay, don't go.

1260
01:27:56,957 --> 01:28:00,291
Officer Lau, why did you use the stairs.

1261
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:01,749
There is an elevator.

1262
01:28:02,416 --> 01:28:03,541
Don't talk anymore, arrest them.

1263
01:28:03,541 --> 01:28:04,416
Yes.

1264
01:28:50,707 --> 01:28:51,832
How's it?

1265
01:28:51,832 --> 01:28:53,041
They've been arrested.

1266
01:28:53,041 --> 01:28:54,832
They paid for it at the end of the day.

1267
01:28:55,041 --> 01:28:56,999
See how happy they are.

1268
01:28:57,832 --> 01:29:00,374
People are crazy for money.

1269
01:29:00,749 --> 01:29:04,874
We have the same dream before,

1270
01:29:04,874 --> 01:29:06,624
it's time to awake.

1271
01:29:06,957 --> 01:29:10,957
We should be satisfied with our occupation.

1272
01:29:11,166 --> 01:29:12,207
Let's go.

1273
01:29:13,166 --> 01:29:14,082
Take your time.

1274
01:29:20,124 --> 01:29:21,041
Sir, are you coming for dinner?

1275
01:29:21,041 --> 01:29:22,457
Not Japanese food tonight.

1276
01:29:22,457 --> 01:29:23,541
Never mind.

1277
01:29:23,541 --> 01:29:24,416
I'm going to Seafood Restaurant.

1278
01:29:24,416 --> 01:29:25,499
Our services are joint.

1279
01:29:26,041 --> 01:29:27,707
Take care of this car.

1280
01:29:34,749 --> 01:29:35,874
What are you looking at?

1281
01:29:36,249 --> 01:29:38,457
My sister got the education fund.

1282
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:39,749
And a part-time job.

1283
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:40,999
It's great.

1284
01:29:43,332 --> 01:29:44,874
Your pizza is coming.

1285
01:29:50,332 --> 01:29:52,207
I can't park it,

1286
01:29:52,916 --> 01:29:54,749
can you park for me?

1287
01:29:57,416 --> 01:29:58,124
How's this?

1288
01:29:58,124 --> 01:29:59,499
Your dream comes true.
