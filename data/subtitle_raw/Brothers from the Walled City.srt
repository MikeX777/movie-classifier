1
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,051
They're all gone

2
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:10,825
Go over there

3
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,760
What's for?

4
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,756
Just go on

5
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,627
What the hell is it to you
if I go to the 'Ladies'?

6
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,761
You dare report me to the old woman

7
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:19,736
I didn't

8
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:20,601
I'll beat you up

9
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,608
Stop...

10
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:24,967
We can stop but from now on

11
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,569
you'll have to pay us 30 cents
protection money

12
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,079
Then we'll not beat you up

13
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,173
nor will anyone else dare, pay up

14
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:31,773
I have no money

15
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:33,876
Brother, that gang is bullying
Man Chai again

16
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:34,715
Let's take a look

17
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:36,852
What do you think you're doing?

18
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:37,388
What's up?

19
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,855
You bully him because you are outnumbered

20
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:40,152
He wanted protection money from me
just now

21
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,989
Kid, not even I have asked you lot
for protection money

22
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,426
and you dare ask him for it?

23
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,690
You must be tired of living

24
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:45,821
You dare to be a busybody here

25
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:46,830
I'll beat you up too

26
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:48,833
Stop, do you know who my father is?

27
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,903
I don't care if he's the governor himself

28
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,835
My father is known as the Uncle Loong

29
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:53,530
Did you know that?

30
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,370
Nope, although I've eaten
lots of loong ha (Iobsters)

31
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,374
Are you trying to insult my father?

32
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,468
Beat him up

33
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,078
Run, quick

34
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,453
Chase him, stop...

35
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,087
Stop, don't run...

36
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,220
Bastard, you dare hit others

37
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,433
You overturned my stall

38
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,127
You two bastards again

39
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,226
Bastard

40
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:27,470
If you have the guts look for me
at school tomorrow

41
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:28,939
Would I be afraid of you?

42
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,033
What's the matter, bluffing?

43
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,736
If you're still here we'll beat you up too

44
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,710
What's the big deal?

45
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,247
You kids fight all day

46
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,180
I'll tell your fathers

47
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:38,978
Please don't, brother Wang

48
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,052
We dare not next time

49
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,279
Yes we won't dare

50
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,251
Go on quickly

51
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:42,912
Goodbye

52
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:43,716
Da De, Xiao De

53
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:44,687
Are you two alright?

54
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,952
Yep. Would have killed them
if they didn't flee in time

55
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,186
Let's go

56
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,196
Do we have 5 cents, I'd like to eat
sweet beancurd

57
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,097
Where do we get money for it?

58
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,762
You spent the last cent this morning

59
00:03:58,871 --> 00:03:59,496
Let's go

60
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:00,363
Xiao De

61
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,566
You must be enjoying huh,
we fought for you just now

62
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,540
and you're hiding here now
eating sweet beancurd

63
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,305
I'll treat you, then

64
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:07,543
What are you doing?

65
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,205
They asked you for 30 cents and now

66
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:11,715
you treat us to only 5 cents' won'th of
sweet bean curd

67
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,748
That's all I have, eat up

68
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,244
What's there to look at, go away

69
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,344
Pretty girl

70
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,554
Do you want to know the colour
of her panties?

71
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,358
Do you have the guts to ask her?

72
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,933
Never mind, how much do you have on you?

73
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:30,795
30 cents

74
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:31,733
Give the money to me

75
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:32,566
What for?

76
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:33,434
I'll make you a bet

77
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,439
I'll pull up her skirt for you
to have a look

78
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,098
Give me the money

79
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,039
Alright

80
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,245
Da De, your brother really has guts

81
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,354
Great fun

82
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,288
Sex maniac

83
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,951
You devil, pulling up my skirt

84
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,221
Stop

85
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:00,526
Are you shameless?

86
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,567
Policeman, he pulled up
my daughter's skirt

87
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,431
Arrest him

88
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,561
What's your name? Where do you live?

89
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,600
I'll report you to your school

90
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,265
What a bad kid!

91
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,238
Little tramp

92
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,475
Stop

93
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,239
Don't run

94
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,547
Xiao De, let's enter the city

95
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,319
You go that way

96
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,223
Stop

97
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:28,924
You're looking for death

98
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,329
Bastard

99
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:37,659
Mister, have a seat

100
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,499
I have no time, I have to work

101
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,381
Little brother, what's up?
Where's the policeman?

102
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:00,122
He doesn't have the guts to come in here

103
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,717
Bullshit. If not for me,
you couldn't have escaped

104
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,729
Go and look for ninth uncle quickly

105
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:21,778
Strip...

106
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,223
It's said, 'Touch a bra & you get
3 years' bad luck'

107
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,221
you touched the panties,
you'll surely have bad luck

108
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,424
for the rest of your life

109
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,398
Touch wood

110
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:48,171
Come out...

111
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,606
Please be quiet

112
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,871
I'm not performing this show

113
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,241
This show will be exciting

114
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,510
it features two lovers

115
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,279
Hold on to your tickets if you've got them

116
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,183
if not go and get them quickly

117
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,915
If you're not watching, please go

118
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,287
May I present Leung Shan Pak please

119
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,784
Come out quickly

120
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:09,856
Please

121
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,061
Your wife refuses to appear up,
speak to her quickly

122
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:19,397
Go quickly

123
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,572
No way, over my dead body

124
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,938
Not unless I'm dead

125
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:28,572
No, you're shameless, do it yourself

126
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,439
I'm not doing it...

127
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,978
What's to be afraid of?
I've got payment already

128
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,384
Let's pretend we're doing it at home

129
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,979
I'm not as despicable as you

130
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,186
You have to do it

131
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,587
No way, never

132
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,030
Where are you going?

133
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,694
To get Shing's wife

134
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:54,232
Forget it, he is way out of line

135
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,807
to force his wife to do such a thing

136
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,876
Forget it, find another one

137
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,671
Where?

138
00:07:58,778 --> 00:07:59,574
Go and look

139
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,546
Friend, have you bought a ticket?

140
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,376
Yes

141
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,313
Go on inside

142
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,213
You two little devils

143
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:09,913
Ninth uncle

144
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:10,886
what are you doing here?

145
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,048
To see you

146
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,056
What for?

147
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,450
Have you eaten?

148
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,552
If not, eat with my dad

149
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,324
I have no time now, I'll go later

150
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,167
20 cents each

151
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,467
Thanks

152
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,409
Help, robbery

153
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,172
Robbery?

154
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,874
I have no money

155
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,742
Beat him

156
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:46,221
Help, robbery, I have no money

157
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:52,795
Run, quick

158
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,331
Kids...

159
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,605
This way please

160
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,808
A empty seat over there

161
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:09,609
4 bamboos

162
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,085
Eighty thousand

163
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,659
I win again

164
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,193
Sorry, pay up

165
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,863
You're playing a smooth hand

166
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,298
winning all the time

167
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,300
You've won a lot today

168
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,203
Not a lot, just having fun

169
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,765
Go and play at a bigger table
(bigger stakes)

170
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,401
No need, just having some fun will do

171
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,477
Friend, someone's waiting for you outside

172
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,175
I am winning now

173
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,410
He said it's urgent

174
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,043
Right, go and look

175
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,714
What for?

176
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:51,653
Don't worry

177
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,451
Ah Chu

178
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,560
Damn

179
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:56,556
What? Why are you treating customers
like this?

180
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:57,151
Customer?

181
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,127
You think I'm an amateur?

182
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,130
Why are you beating me?

183
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:03,695
Do you take me for a swindler?

184
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,560
If you can't explain, I'll make
this publicly known

185
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,501
Be careful

186
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:07,861
Shut up, we're going to fix you

187
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,866
You have no right to search me, let go

188
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,945
No right? This is our right

189
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,013
Stop

190
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:23,785
You've come in good time

191
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,823
If you can't find anything, it means
you're bullying me

192
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,548
Can one only lose but not win here?

193
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,652
Brother, we never bully anyone

194
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,355
and no one bullies me

195
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,967
Bastard, do you still deny cheating?

196
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,162
I have not framed you, have I?

197
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,238
You dare to

198
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,672
hold this in your mouth,
not a drop of saliva too

199
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,548
Enough...

200
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,122
Listen, don't ever let me

201
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,289
find you here again

202
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,923
or I'll maim you

203
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:08,625
Father

204
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,470
Kid, what are you doing here?

205
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,298
Get out

206
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:16,368
Ah Sing, give him some money
to visit a bone setter

207
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:19,642
My son

208
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:20,177
Father

209
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,746
I told you to get out, why are you
still here?

210
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,404
Where's your little brother?

211
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,140
Downstairs

212
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,909
Father, we're so hungry

213
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,080
Go down and wait for me

214
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:32,590
Xiao Li, I'm going to Mei Wa
to have a meal

215
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,624
look for me if there's anything

216
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:34,522
I'll wrap it for you

217
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,958
Give me ten cents to buy something to eat

218
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,689
Right, 20 cents would be nice

219
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:38,456
It's fixed

220
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:39,622
How smart

221
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:40,760
Quick enough?

222
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,594
Yes

223
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,169
Arert you afraid father would find out

224
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,329
you're wrapping cocaine for others?

225
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,371
Kids

226
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,537
Father

227
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:49,539
So quick

228
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,433
What are you all doing here?

229
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:51,976
Nothing

230
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,170
Hungry?

231
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:53,745
Yes

232
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:54,744
Let's go

233
00:11:58,951 --> 00:11:59,417
Uncle Loong

234
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:00,314
How many times have I told you

235
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,443
not to set up your stall in front of
my entrance

236
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,145
Yes...

237
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,188
If I see you again when I return,
I'll burn it all

238
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:05,257
Get lost now

239
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,689
Mister, come over here

240
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,993
Kids, did you smell that?

241
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,658
Such a nice aroma

242
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,896
it will tempt even papa

243
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,269
Bastard, if I can't stand firm (tempted)

244
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,101
You're in trouble

245
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,008
Dad, you're joking

246
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,701
Let's go

247
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,309
Uncle Loong, have a seat

248
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,018
What's good to eat?

249
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,281
Naturally we have the good stuff

250
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,152
We've just cut up a small black cur;
plump and smooth

251
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,657
Have a catty

252
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,020
Dad, have two catties instead

253
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,096
Ninth uncle will come in a while

254
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,487
Two catties

255
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:45,996
Okay

256
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,963
Two more taels of "fox bone" wine

257
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,398
Right, dad?

258
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,268
Smart, coming

259
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,905
Dad, what happened just now?

260
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,307
That fellow wanted to be a cheat

261
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,468
Really?

262
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,508
At my dad's mahjong house?

263
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,876
He must be tired of living

264
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:03,778
Shut up

265
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:07,211
You two have finished school for so long

266
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,217
where have you gone?

267
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,750
A friend fell and hurt himself,
so we helped him

268
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:12,953
Right, brother?

269
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:13,820
That's right

270
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,521
You want to deceive me?

271
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,221
Have you been fighting?

272
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,422
No, father

273
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,756
Da De, Xiao De

274
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:21,423
Ninth uncle

275
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:22,694
Come over here

276
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,536
Make way... it's hot

277
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,700
Ninth uncle...

278
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,539
How's the shop doing?

279
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,407
Still the same

280
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,477
Let me

281
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,348
Dad, is the wine good for the kidneys?

282
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:39,481
Dad, Ninth uncle

283
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,280
if so then it's won'th a try

284
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:42,445
we want some too

285
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,113
Right, aunty Wa

286
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:46,687
No, you're under aged, no wine

287
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,558
I'm not doing it

288
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,827
Let me go

289
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,834
You can't hide forever

290
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,165
I'm not doing it

291
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:02,971
It's not up to you

292
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,434
Stop beating

293
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,203
None of your business

294
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:10,705
Beat you to death...

295
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:13,845
Beat me? Are you out of your mind?

296
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:20,590
Are you nuts?

297
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:24,753
You want to kill your own wife?

298
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,256
What a scumbag, only just now
he forced his wife

299
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,926
to host a real show at my place,
he is not human

300
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,662
You've lost everyone because of
your drug habit

301
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,530
Alright, you go back first

302
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,636
No way, never

303
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:36,805
Where are you going?

304
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,141
What do you want? What else do you want?

305
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,208
Nothing

306
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,804
She's my wife, I can do
whatever I like with her

307
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,850
How could you ask your wife
to do such a thing?

308
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:46,781
Why not?

309
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,716
If you paid me

310
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,151
I could ask her to sleep with you

311
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:54,754
Addict Shing

312
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,193
don't ever expect to get cocaine here
again

313
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,800
Let's not waste time on this bastard

314
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,062
a waste of our efforts, let's go

315
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,101
What are you looking at?

316
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,840
Look...

317
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,471
I'll take off my pants for you
to have a look...

318
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:17,779
Shameless

319
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:18,713
Damn

320
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:31,457
Dad, for you

321
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:34,929
Where did you get it?

322
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,365
You tell me

323
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:42,837
Quick

324
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:47,872
We saw a robbery just as
we finished school

325
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,346
and also saw a pack of cigarettes
on the ground

326
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,746
so little brother picked it up

327
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,986
What have I been teaching you?

328
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,145
You can't even look after you kid brother

329
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,112
and let him steal from a robbery

330
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,149
It's not my fault, he picked it up himself

331
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,124
You dare to answer back?

332
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,719
One should not pick things up
from the street

333
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,627
How many times have I told you

334
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,393
I told you not to run around after school

335
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,168
and yet you've come to the
mahjong house to look for me

336
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:11,965
Come here

337
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,536
Dad, I won't do it again next time

338
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,165
That's what you say each time

339
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,306
It's because I didn't study hard as a kid

340
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,743
that I now have to work in
the mahjong house

341
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,644
If you don't study hard

342
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,114
how could you have a career in society?

343
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,480
Get me my clothes

344
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:35,989
Wipe away the blood

345
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:37,562
Thanks, dad

346
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,456
Teach your kid brother to study hard

347
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,966
he's failed in a few subjects
according to his report

348
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:43,864
Yes

349
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,603
Luckily dad didn't beat me

350
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:48,434
Easy for you to say

351
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,367
You picked up the cigarettes
but he beat me

352
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,604
you failed and he scolded me

353
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,371
Take out your books and study

354
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,979
I think dad is over doing it

355
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:01,484
What's the use of studying so much?

356
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,821
Inside Kowloon Walled City

357
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,889
everyone knows my dad is Uncle Loong

358
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,854
When I grow up

359
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,619
I could get a job easily

360
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,819
Shut up and get your books out to study

361
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,896
or dad will beat me up again
when he returns

362
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,394
Alright

363
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,089
You take care the place

364
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,048
Uncle Loong, good morning

365
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:08,847
Good morning

366
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:24,860
Good morning

367
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,800
Good morning, where's the money?

368
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:27,765
Here

369
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,605
Hurry up, we'll be late again

370
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,879
Look at your books, they're all in my bag

371
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:36,904
This is yours

372
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:37,743
There's more

373
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,755
I guess that punk wouldn't dare
beat me again today

374
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:53,456
He wouldn't dare

375
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:54,129
Of course

376
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,097
Kids

377
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,264
Father

378
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,318
Dad

379
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:25,054
Dad...

380
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,406
Dad...

381
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:46,943
Don't run...

382
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,362
Don't...

383
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,432
Dead, what to do?

384
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,336
Dead?

385
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,169
What to do?

386
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,106
Father

387
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,311
Father...

388
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,780
Don't die... dad...

389
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,376
Don't die... dad...

390
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,042
Dad, don't die

391
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:54,880
Get ninth uncle, quick

392
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,079
Get him quickly

393
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,656
Dad, don't die

394
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,858
Don't die

395
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:05,756
Dad, don't die

396
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:32,247
Dad...

397
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:33,984
Don't cry

398
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,365
Well, not bad, huh?

399
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,071
Xiao De, come on

400
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:49,663
you're not flying an airplane

401
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:52,608
if you crash, nothing I do can pay
for the damages

402
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,181
If we crash, you do us a favour to fix it

403
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,314
Don't worry as long as my husband
is driving

404
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,018
My wife knows me well

405
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,289
Good car

406
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:11,987
Of course, it's a Porsche

407
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,163
What' the big deal?

408
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:17,667
The car is great, but the people
in it are not

409
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:25,302
Sit tight

410
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,237
Look... there's a railing in front

411
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,450
How dangerous

412
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,220
Of course, this is mid-night Grand Prix

413
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:16,885
This I have to see

414
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,601
Come on...

415
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:26,568
I'm doing it right now

416
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:27,660
None of your business

417
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:38,012
Faster...

418
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,451
Look, so many people

419
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:50,152
Great fun, can't take anymore, speed up

420
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:08,270
Hope your car crashes!

421
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:13,477
Damn, I'm finished, this car's
a total loss

422
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,679
Don't be like that, there are people
around

423
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:46,811
Mr. Cheung, why haven't you
looked me up for so long?

424
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,442
Stop uttering rubbish

425
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,544
Didrt you say you have a new girl for me?

426
00:24:50,856 --> 00:24:51,686
A new girl?

427
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,020
Girls these days don't know how to please

428
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:58,618
unlike us, who were so gentle
and beautiful

429
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:04,168
Unfortunately I'm ten years
older than you, or else...

430
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:07,033
Who's talking about age with you?

431
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,504
We talk about this now

432
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,338
Right...

433
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,472
Are you introducing me to the new comer?

434
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:17,713
Yes, let me think

435
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:24,453
Lily is too tall for you

436
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:28,287
And Mary? She is repugnant

437
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:30,384
don't get her

438
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:34,295
Mimi looks good but her figure is not good

439
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,664
Thanks boss

440
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,234
Cheung the great is calling you

441
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,570
What can I do for you?

442
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:46,303
I am taking all the girls today

443
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:50,074
except for her and her bunch

444
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,312
Thanks, mister Cheung

445
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:53,449
What's the big deal?

446
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:59,385
So lascivious and disgusting

447
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,197
Da De, do we have to start the show
later tonight?

448
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:11,793
It's about time, start as usual

449
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:21,338
Officer Cheung is waiting for you

450
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:22,310
inside the room

451
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:28,075
Thank you

452
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,152
Where's uncle Biu today?

453
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:34,816
He's gone to Singapore

454
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:35,688
and won't be back till next week

455
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,255
Oh man, I've got to hand it to him

456
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,159
He's over sixty and has a few families

457
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,924
how does he do it?

458
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:44,000
Uncle boasts of his figure

459
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:45,860
Officer Cheung, sorry

460
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,836
Excuse me

461
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,501
Enjoy yourself, we'll talk later

462
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,169
No problem

463
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:57,773
He says uncle Biu is good

464
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,975
I say officer Cheung is even better

465
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:01,709
Obviously

466
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,913
just look at his nose

467
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:04,511
Let's drink

468
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,488
Coming

469
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:15,225
Coming immediately...

470
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:17,828
Ladies, sit over there please

471
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:25,637
Go over there

472
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:35,678
Over there, see?

473
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,951
See how they are enjoying themselves

474
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,151
I'll have a little fun with them

475
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:42,960
Think of a plan

476
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,995
Right... let's release the air
from his tyres

477
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,529
That's childish, not much fun

478
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:48,763
Let's scratch his car

479
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:49,424
No meaning

480
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,828
Let's crash his screen

481
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,267
No, if we're caught

482
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,236
we'll be beaten to death

483
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,870
C'mon then, think of a way.
You do claim to be smart

484
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,403
That's because I love to eat

485
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:01,143
Never mind the bullshit,
think of another way

486
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:15,987
Damn, it's so frustrating

487
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:17,618
That guy was so detestable

488
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:19,219
He wouldn't buy more time with me

489
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,991
yet he wants me to have a late snack
with him

490
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,067
there wouldn't be much benefit if I went

491
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,100
right?

492
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,033
Mine's even worse, he bought two hours

493
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,003
and his hands were all over me

494
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,601
Why didn't you slap him?

495
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,734
I did even better, I touched him too

496
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,243
He would have died for that

497
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,414
What are looking at, bastard?
Don't recognise me?

498
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,614
Even a good man fears an abusive woman

499
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,714
What? You bastard

500
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:45,479
Have I stepped on your tail?

501
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,757
You have a cur's stinking mouth

502
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,349
You bitches, I'll give you a good beating

503
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,292
What? Would I be scared of you?

504
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,658
Forget it, sit down

505
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,764
Miss, I apologise

506
00:28:55,867 --> 00:28:57,732
If you want to mess around, go home

507
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,599
Please, be quiet, forget it...

508
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,571
You dare mess with me?

509
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:14,743
Officer...

510
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:15,182
What's the matter?

511
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:16,480
There are two suspicious characters
over there

512
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,021
I don't know what they're doing,
please check them out

513
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:18,817
Where?

514
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:19,480
Over there

515
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,148
Take me to them

516
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,166
This deal could bring us lots of money

517
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:34,897
Right

518
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:36,500
Officer, here they are

519
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:44,412
Hurry, the police is giving out tickets

520
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,012
I'm sorry, Officer, I'm leaving
immediately

521
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:49,846
I am sorry

522
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:14,406
Big Brother

523
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:15,669
Who did this?

524
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,610
I don't know

525
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,409
Come, come over

526
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:19,175
Get hold of them

527
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,451
Stop, clear it up before you go

528
00:30:26,257 --> 00:30:27,053
What fun!

529
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,649
That big-mouth bastard can't do anything

530
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,855
that was quite an exciting scene

531
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,056
What a thrill!

532
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,425
What's going to happen to him next?

533
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,264
Maybe he has to pay for the indemnity

534
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,304
or maybe he'll be taken to
the police station

535
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,671
Wait, can they identify us?

536
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:48,939
Hong Kong is such a big place

537
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,105
how could we be recognized so easily

538
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:51,341
Even if they did, what could they do?

539
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:52,245
TRUE

540
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,317
What's there to be afraid of?

541
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,046
Let's find some entertainment

542
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,546
Hurry

543
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,787
Get off...

544
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:02,860
Hurry...

545
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,553
Get off...

546
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:05,526
This is a nice place

547
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:07,358
What are we doing here?

548
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,490
Barbeque? Tell me early

549
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,865
Barbeque? Screw you, eat them yourself

550
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:13,529
Ah Ling, let's go over there

551
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:16,239
We're leaving too

552
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:16,898
Alright

553
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:18,637
What about me?

554
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,142
You enjoy yourself

555
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,270
Don't dirty the car, make use of
the tissues in there

556
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,317
The tissues are too coarse,
you must be joking

557
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:39,888
Xiao De

558
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,192
What?

559
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,461
My period is late for 10 days

560
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:49,172
No way! You said it was your
safety period that day

561
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,337
Maybe it's because

562
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:54,638
you are not feeling too well. Right?

563
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,618
No. Don't

564
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:05,721
Don't

565
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,952
Let go of me

566
00:32:09,694 --> 00:32:10,752
What are you doing?

567
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,824
No

568
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:20,899
No

569
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:28,471
No...

570
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,006
Don't stop

571
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,711
Hurry... Hurry

572
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,050
Hurry

573
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,082
Don't panic, I can't do it in a hurry

574
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,992
Hurry

575
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,223
The condoms are all used up

576
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,459
What? I just bought you over a dozen
last week

577
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,865
and you've already used them all?
You bastard

578
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:54,795
You bastard asked me to give myself relief

579
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,271
It's you do it now

580
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,521
I don't want to tonight

581
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:17,317
But I do

582
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,159
Sorry to interrupt you

583
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,530
You haven't paid your tuition fees
and want to learn?

584
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:25,761
It's a fair world

585
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:28,100
Alright, each one will provide relief
for himself today

586
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:28,831
Damn it

587
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,132
Don't run

588
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,607
You should leave, your brother
is home already

589
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,372
I have to go too, dad will be back soon

590
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:38,949
Alright

591
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,242
Are you going to meet another woman?

592
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,684
You got it wrong, three a day

593
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,153
I'll take you back

594
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,189
You drink a lot tonight

595
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,791
Didrt expect you to be a strong drinker

596
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:55,422
You're not bad yourself

597
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,465
I couldn't get you drunk

598
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,537
It's a robbery, officer.
Shouldrt you make an arrest?

599
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:04,264
Not yet, wait until they've got the money

600
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,036
then we can catch them red-handed

601
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,577
or we can be sued for wrong accusation

602
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,404
Three hundred dollars only?

603
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:11,710
Give me the pearl necklace

604
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:12,339
No

605
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,384
It's from my Mom

606
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,947
Give it back to me

607
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:19,949
Don't move, or I'll shoot

608
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,685
They robbed me

609
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,192
Come over

610
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:26,485
Drop the knife

611
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,998
Damn, don't move

612
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,328
Officer, it has nothing to do with me

613
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,466
Come over

614
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,537
It has nothing to do with me

615
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:35,506
Beat you up

616
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:40,940
Go over there

617
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,245
Handcuff yourself

618
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,612
This is called caught in the spot

619
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,015
Da De, call the station for me

620
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,112
I'll handle the case here

621
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:54,986
Yes, Sir

622
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:57,560
Miss, are you alright?

623
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:05,562
Hot dumplings...

624
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,398
Give me one

625
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,036
Thank you

626
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:22,110
Hot dumplings...

627
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,490
Brother, you're back

628
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:32,119
Yes

629
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:42,804
Brother, have some dumplings

630
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:44,537
Keep it for yourself

631
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,578
Brother, you've bought one too

632
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:54,207
Yes

633
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,216
How can I have two?

634
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,486
I'll eat with you

635
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,086
Brother, I'll make some tea for you

636
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,628
Xiao De, how can you go to school

637
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:09,427
when you stay up late every night?

638
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,097
I've finished my homework at night

639
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,500
so I can sleep a bit more during the day

640
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,539
Brother, it's fun to have a
second-hand car

641
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:21,439
Do you have a driver's licence?

642
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:24,213
No, but I can drive

643
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,441
Wait until you get one

644
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:34,414
Don'tjust keep reading this stuff all day

645
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:35,389
pay more attention to your study

646
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:36,687
It's fun

647
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,161
The physics teacher saw you

648
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,293
and you didn't even know

649
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,332
Only you can think of such a thing

650
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,264
You are stupid enough

651
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,671
You should have someone on the lookout

652
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:54,836
How come you are so stupid?

653
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,744
Goodbye

654
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,582
My dear, you're so early

655
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:02,175
It's so rare

656
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:02,911
It's so rare

657
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:05,918
What is it?

658
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:10,060
What else? Must be total failure

659
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,556
It's no surprise

660
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:15,192
What do you want to eat?

661
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:15,663
Nothing

662
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:16,391
How about you?

663
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,196
Dear, have you really failed
in all subjects?

664
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:21,835
Take it out, I'll change them for you

665
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:25,941
Not this time

666
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,441
Dad will surely kill me

667
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,794
Don't cry, let's think of a way

668
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,057
What else can we do?

669
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:49,424
Don't be like that

670
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:50,864
Do you want to let the whole world
know about it?

671
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,532
What am I going to do?

672
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,706
What to do?

673
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:58,841
Had you listened to me

674
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,739
everything would have been alright

675
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,275
What has that to do with me?

676
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,439
Every time you say it's alright

677
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,440
Lower your voice, please

678
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:09,879
You've now made a mess
& want to blame it on me

679
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:12,453
Don't cry

680
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,753
What are you doing? You can shun
the responsibility

681
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,192
Stop shouting

682
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:20,987
What is it?

683
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,433
Having failed is no big deal,
why scold her?

684
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,601
Shut up, nobody will think you're dumb

685
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:29,339
He...

686
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,001
What is it?

687
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,015
Nuts

688
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:00,932
Hey kid

689
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:03,395
Tastes good huh?

690
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,536
Brother, do you recognize me?

691
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,644
We had a car race the other night

692
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,046
Which night?

693
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:13,577
Let me refresh your memory

694
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,651
Remember?

695
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:17,778
A little bit

696
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,820
Yes...

697
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,422
Where's that bastard who drove the car?

698
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:23,855
I don't know

699
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,255
I don't know

700
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:27,831
Don't you know now?

701
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,593
Yes...

702
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:31,398
Where does he live?

703
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,564
I don't know

704
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,405
Where is he now?

705
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:36,603
I don't know

706
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,538
Yes...

707
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,003
Will he be coming?

708
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,278
He...

709
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,348
Is he coming or not?

710
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:45,847
He...

711
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:46,507
Speak up

712
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,448
Yes...

713
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:49,610
When?

714
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:51,948
When?

715
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,182
Uncle, don't meddle in our affair,
alright?

716
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:53,984
Stop talking nonsense

717
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:56,457
Xiao De, run, run

718
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,927
Don't run...

719
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:36,899
Stand still

720
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:53,845
Are you blind?

721
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:55,816
Sorry, Sir

722
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:00,020
Sorry, Sir

723
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,425
Sorry, Officer Cheung

724
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:05,290
What happened? You are more fierce
than I am

725
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,226
chasing and beating people in the street

726
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,025
That bastard fooled me

727
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,759
I don't care

728
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,061
Behave yourself

729
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,465
or I'll arrest you

730
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:14,331
It's not that serious, is it?

731
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,238
Behave yourself, go

732
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,140
Arert you leaving? What are you
standing here for?

733
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,111
What's the big deal?

734
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,146
You are all useless,

735
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:33,518
you can't even catch that bastard

736
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,387
Find him, or never see me again

737
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:36,888
No

738
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,564
Abortion is bad for the body
and is dangerous

739
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,188
I won't allow you to do that

740
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:45,234
Mom, what am I going to do now?

741
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:49,329
Mom

742
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,101
You dad is back now

743
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,369
clean up your face

744
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:55,502
I'll find a chance to talk to him

745
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:00,874
What are you doing?

746
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:01,911
Preparing dinner

747
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:03,483
Dad

748
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,017
Ah Ling, don't go back to your room yet

749
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:13,321
Sit down, let's chat for a while

750
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,001
How come you didn't go out today?

751
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:26,966
Your eyes are red, have you been crying?

752
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,637
What happened? Have you been bullied?

753
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:32,477
Tell me

754
00:42:34,118 --> 00:42:34,914
It's nothing

755
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:39,347
Maybe the contact lenses don't fit

756
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:42,254
Nothing's wrong

757
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,887
Get a new pair if they don't fit

758
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,292
be careful not to hurt your eyes

759
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,091
Yes

760
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,630
Did the schools give out the
report cards today?

761
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,223
Yes

762
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:52,698
How did you do?

763
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:55,469
I'm asking you

764
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,664
Eighteenth

765
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:59,137
Not bad

766
00:42:59,243 --> 00:42:59,902
Show it to me

767
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:06,512
Have some tea

768
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:15,983
Dad

769
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:35,612
Who's this guy?

770
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:37,673
A classmate

771
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,377
A classmate

772
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,308
It's really my classmate

773
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:46,582
You lied to me

774
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,385
You two are too close to be
ordinary classmates

775
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,090
Speak, who is he?

776
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,287
Dad, no... dad

777
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:53,590
Are you telling or not?

778
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:55,289
Speak, who is he?

779
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,134
Why are you hitting her? Calm down

780
00:43:58,235 --> 00:44:00,396
See how you teach your daughter

781
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:01,937
The poor girl could be cheated
in some days

782
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,063
and you are still kept in the dark

783
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,940
Mom, see for yourself

784
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:14,449
If he knew, he would surely kill me

785
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,548
Wait until he's calm, I'll think of
some ways

786
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:30,526
Go in

787
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:33,431
What are you doing?

788
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,225
Take him out, see how fast he can run

789
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:28,016
Go

790
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:30,791
Go

791
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:31,622
Try to be cool?

792
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,126
Go

793
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:39,963
Sit down

794
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:41,834
What are you doing?

795
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,133
Has this bastard committed rape?

796
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,970
No. He's running naked in front of
a girls' school

797
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,904
Officer, that's not true, I've been set up

798
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:50,673
Don't frame me

799
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,343
What, will the police frame
an innocent person?

800
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:55,709
We'll find out

801
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:59,277
Okay. Officer Cheung likes to have fun
with those punks

802
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:00,879
Alright, he's all yours

803
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:01,821
Okay

804
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:02,892
Officer Cheung is here

805
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,023
Stand here

806
00:46:04,328 --> 00:46:05,989
Bring him out later

807
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,723
Officer Cheung, he's yours

808
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:11,726
Officer

809
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:12,999
What happened?

810
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:15,305
This bastard is blatant

811
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:17,703
Blatant? I'll teach him in his place
in a while

812
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:18,274
Come over

813
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:19,609
Officer

814
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,438
Go

815
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:22,140
What about him?

816
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:23,537
Bad conduct

817
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:26,577
This bastard ran naked in front of
a girls' school

818
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:27,542
Ran naked?

819
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,010
Kid, are you well hung?

820
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,912
No, Sir, I've been set up

821
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:39,121
Sir, your daughter and I are good friends

822
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,859
if you don't believe me, you can ask her

823
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:48,270
Kid, don't make some empty claims

824
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:48,997
What do you want?

825
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:52,904
Come with me

826
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:55,177
We are investigating this case

827
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:56,439
You can bail him out for the time being

828
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:57,338
Thank you

829
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:01,617
Ah Sing, is Chan Ka Cheong here yet?

830
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:03,618
Yes, Officer Cheung has taken him
to his room

831
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:05,679
Follow me

832
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:06,221
Alright

833
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:15,589
Brother

834
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:19,124
He is your brother?

835
00:47:25,542 --> 00:47:27,635
Look at you. Very soon you could be
beaten to death

836
00:47:29,046 --> 00:47:29,910
He's careless

837
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:35,911
Officer Cheung, you beat up
every suspect in each case

838
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:41,250
I just go by the book. You can file
a complaint, though

839
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,319
Never mind...

840
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:44,826
Make the necessary arrangements
for your brother, go

841
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:48,757
Wait

842
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:52,725
Ask your brother never to see
my daughter again

843
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:59,772
Brother, you have to trust me

844
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:02,706
Brother, listen to me

845
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:07,639
Brother, help me

846
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:11,277
You've to stick your neck out for me
on this one, bro

847
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:12,316
Stick my neck out?

848
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:13,650
If I stuck my neck out you will be
beaten to death

849
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,452
It's not my fault, that bastard

850
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,220
stripped me of my clothes and
shoved me on the street

851
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:18,225
Help me please

852
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:20,419
Why'd others mess with you
if you don't bother them?

853
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:22,264
How come no one has bothered to
take off my pants?

854
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:32,904
A naked Danish hen is hopping
everywhere, so disgusting

855
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:33,971
Do you agree?

856
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:34,771
So what?

857
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:37,108
I'll expose you for peeping at
your sister bathing

858
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:38,536
Alright, I will not talk

859
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:39,707
That big-mouth bastard is so arrogant

860
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:40,783
Ask your big brother to fix him

861
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:41,373
Nuts

862
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,645
If you want to fix him for
such trivial matters

863
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,948
then many other people would have
to be fixed

864
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,488
So you are letting this go?

865
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,951
Why bother my elder brother,
won't I do just as well?

866
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:53,857
Anything could be fixed except bullshit

867
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:54,988
Exactly

868
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:56,890
The truth is he dares not tell
his elder brother

869
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,659
You have a point

870
00:48:58,201 --> 00:48:59,031
You insult me

871
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,368
You are good at insulting the people only

872
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:08,967
You bothered him while he was
taking drugs, right?

873
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,436
Go up and think of something

874
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,021
Well, any ideas?

875
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:26,722
You lot are so useless,
think of something quick

876
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,353
You guys are so frustrating

877
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:30,764
Let's douse him with urine

878
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,529
Let's make it worse for him

879
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,102
How?

880
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:34,329
Add some shit to the urine

881
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,434
Where do we find so much shit and urine?

882
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,802
We'll each contribute

883
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:39,170
Wouldrt that be enough?

884
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:39,833
No

885
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:40,932
Xiao De

886
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:47,014
Xiao De, I have a plan, it must work

887
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:47,583
Wait

888
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,178
Bring that big-mouth bastard back in a bag

889
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:53,017
Tie him up and feed him with cocaine

890
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:55,318
If he won't take, we'll surround
and smoke him with it

891
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:56,824
so that even by smelling, he'll get hooked

892
00:49:57,394 --> 00:49:58,452
Wouldrt that be revenge for us?

893
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,460
You must be crazy, we will all get hooked

894
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:03,089
before he does

895
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:05,060
I grew up among drug addicts

896
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:05,930
how come I didn't get hooked?

897
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:06,894
Xiao De

898
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:09,500
Calling you?

899
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:11,273
You try to pick up girls like others

900
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,809
yet you create so much trouble, go on...

901
00:50:14,978 --> 00:50:15,467
What is it?

902
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:16,238
Think

903
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:20,241
What is it?

904
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:22,709
What are we going to do?

905
00:50:28,658 --> 00:50:29,647
Let me think of something

906
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:33,591
You are procrastinating

907
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,661
Did you know that my mom knows

908
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,669
Your mom... how about your dad?

909
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:43,162
What difference does it make?

910
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:49,311
You've never thought about me

911
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:01,513
Xiao De, I've got an idea

912
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:02,148
Where's Ah Ling?

913
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:04,690
Don't bother with her, speak

914
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:14,761
Dad

915
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,906
Ah Ling, what's going on?

916
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:18,599
Nothing

917
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:19,675
Nothing?

918
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,773
You can't hide anything from me
since you were small

919
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:23,641
Tell me

920
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:27,582
Has someone molested you?

921
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:29,242
No, Dad

922
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:30,910
There must be something wrong, tell me

923
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:34,618
So, you won't speak, right?

924
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,320
That's fine, I can find out anyway

925
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,923
If I find out that kid has touched you

926
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,257
I'll break his bones

927
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:41,660
Dad, don't

928
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,364
You're nervous, something must
have happened

929
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,791
Have you been cheated?

930
00:51:44,901 --> 00:51:46,334
By whom? Speak

931
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,027
Speak

932
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:47,796
No one has cheated me

933
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:50,099
Who cheated you? Speak

934
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:52,869
Why have you beaten her again?
It's not her fault

935
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:55,274
It's useless even if you beat her to death

936
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:57,210
she's pregnant for 2 months

937
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,440
Do you want to kill the baby too?

938
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,072
Bitch

939
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:03,113
Mom

940
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,434
Cheung Mei Ling

941
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:20,158
Who's Cheung Mei Ling?

942
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:21,429
Here

943
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:26,871
Go in

944
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:40,851
Go on

945
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,628
Quick...

946
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:58,701
Is it done? He's coming

947
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:01,003
Unless he's diabetic,
otherwise there'll be trouble

948
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:01,839
Is it working?

949
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:02,570
Yes

950
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:03,641
They are here

951
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:06,377
Have a seat

952
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:07,680
Brother Ching

953
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,314
The bill?

954
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:15,650
Here it is

955
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:21,291
Brother Ching

956
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:22,126
Coffee again

957
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:22,789
And you?

958
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:23,388
No

959
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:26,030
See if the amount is correct

960
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:30,165
The money?

961
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,598
Here it is

962
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:35,406
I don't want to drink this, you go ahead

963
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:37,079
He's not drinking it, what should we do?

964
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:42,250
Brother, I'm going first

965
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:43,319
Okay... let's go

966
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,014
Waiter, plain tea please

967
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:47,813
I got a idea

968
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:54,892
What's up?

969
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,358
Nothing, your tea is not hot enough

970
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:05,504
This would create a big trouble

971
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:07,668
We can't let him go no matter what

972
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:09,843
Stop nagging, get prepared quickly

973
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:10,804
Go on

974
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:15,579
Tea and milk

975
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:17,008
Thanks

976
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:17,711
Coming

977
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:30,097
Quick

978
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,292
What's the matter?

979
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:40,443
I can't hold back any longer,
please come out

980
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:42,204
Excuse me...

981
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,415
Come out quickly

982
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:48,746
Come out quickly, what are you doing
inside?

983
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:49,844
Come out quickly

984
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:50,817
I just came in

985
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,285
He's been in there a long time

986
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,516
Come out quickly

987
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:56,759
Quick...

988
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:57,588
Damn it

989
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,895
Come out quickly, someone's waiting

990
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:02,856
Come on out

991
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:06,197
You've saved even the room cost

992
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:10,634
Excuse me

993
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,273
Friend, are you finished?

994
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:19,374
So many people

995
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:25,613
I can't take it anymore

996
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,188
Make way

997
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:31,455
What? Go away

998
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:37,359
1, 2, 3, 4... 6, 7, 8, 9

999
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:40,232
The ninth

1000
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:52,841
Done

1001
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:57,981
Burn it shorter

1002
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:01,683
Make a boat

1003
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:05,956
Itjust like an aircraft carrier

1004
00:56:06,429 --> 00:56:07,191
Pour the gasoline in

1005
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:11,434
That's enough

1006
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,263
That bastard, I want to burn him to death

1007
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:15,333
Too much

1008
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:16,672
The more fire the better

1009
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:20,898
Careful

1010
00:56:23,947 --> 00:56:25,505
With this fire we are avenged

1011
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:26,172
That's right

1012
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:28,809
Be careful, use matches

1013
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,878
Hurry...

1014
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:34,381
Hurry, be careful

1015
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,200
If it's so much pain then stop it

1016
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,660
You must be the one who set the fire

1017
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:13,660
Not me

1018
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:17,164
Bright moon shines on ground,
firering shines on ground

1019
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,325
You bastards again

1020
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,028
Don't run...

1021
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,872
Help, a molester

1022
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:26,964
Help, a molester

1023
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,776
Someone's molesting me

1024
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:31,039
Help...

1025
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:31,704
Make way

1026
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:33,013
He's doing dirty deeds

1027
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,147
What have you done?

1028
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:34,682
Why are you doing dirty deeds?

1029
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,184
Let go, go away, let me go

1030
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,083
What have you to say for yourself?

1031
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:40,122
Go away

1032
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:42,516
Help, molester

1033
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,320
Stop, go away...

1034
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:45,553
He molested me

1035
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:47,287
Stop running

1036
00:57:49,332 --> 00:57:50,731
Stop, or I'll beat him up

1037
00:57:50,834 --> 00:57:52,768
Isn't it fair, bastard?

1038
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,895
Go away

1039
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:00,741
There's no point talking to me

1040
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:03,244
I must find my brother before
I can give you a reply

1041
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:04,804
Alright

1042
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,116
I am giving you face by talking to you

1043
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,884
Listen carefully

1044
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,477
If your brother don't apologize to me
by tomorrow

1045
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:13,681
you'll die

1046
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:36,874
Follow me

1047
00:58:45,054 --> 00:58:46,646
You have guts

1048
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:49,987
How dare you bargain with my big brother?

1049
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,527
Brother

1050
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:54,062
We are specifically here
to apologize to Brother Ching

1051
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,597
not to bargain with him

1052
00:59:14,517 --> 00:59:17,179
Xiao De

1053
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:18,049
do you know the rules?

1054
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,651
You mean...

1055
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,720
There's seniority for everything

1056
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:27,023
Be respectful if you're here
specially to apologize

1057
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:30,695
Kneel

1058
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:34,494
Kneel

1059
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:40,272
Wait

1060
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:45,208
Before he drinks it, I have a condition

1061
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:49,444
Speak up

1062
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:52,516
Hold a feast

1063
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:55,557
for these men of mine

1064
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:56,625
to give them some face

1065
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,895
Brother Ching, you have been given
due respect

1066
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:03,056
we are all out here to make a living

1067
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:03,996
let's drink tea and forget our grievances

1068
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:07,427
If I just drink it

1069
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:09,903
that's fine for me but not my men

1070
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:12,202
Alright

1071
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:16,108
If after you have drunk this cup of tea

1072
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:17,975
any brother who is still not pleased

1073
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:21,482
and wants more perks, he can look for
my Ninth uncle

1074
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,115
He's your uncle?

1075
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:24,914
Ninth uncle retired a long time ago

1076
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:26,181
He won't want to be bothered by

1077
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,950
our matters

1078
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:30,657
We should give him face

1079
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:34,696
Since he's your uncle, I'll drink it

1080
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:49,641
It's hard to believe that the son of

1081
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:52,180
Chan Yuan Loong, previous chief
of the Walled City

1082
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:54,943
is kneeling and apologizing to me

1083
01:00:59,522 --> 01:01:00,284
Little brother

1084
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:02,281
Don't mention my father

1085
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:04,120
Don't move, let's talk this out

1086
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:07,290
Xiao De, what else do you want to say?
You have guts

1087
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:07,863
You...

1088
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:09,329
Don't fight

1089
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,600
Ninth uncle...

1090
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:18,606
Uncle Jiu...

1091
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:21,602
You guys brought weapons along with you

1092
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:23,406
do you want to kill your uncle?

1093
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:24,912
No...

1094
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,079
Ah Ching

1095
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:28,650
What have my nephews done

1096
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:30,446
to incite them to fight each other?

1097
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:33,285
Ninth uncle, he started it

1098
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:33,821
What could I do?

1099
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:35,413
Ninth uncle, he insulted my father

1100
01:01:39,462 --> 01:01:44,331
Yi Ching, doesn't matter who's right
or who's wrong

1101
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:46,425
give some face to Uncle Jiu

1102
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:49,801
For any problem hereafter look for
big brother and me

1103
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:51,305
and we'll take care of it for you

1104
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:56,072
Alright, since Ninth uncle is involved,
we'll let it go

1105
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:58,773
Tell you nephew

1106
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,712
not to meddle with me again

1107
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:02,546
otherwise don't blame me for not
giving you "face"

1108
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:03,448
Alright

1109
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:04,949
Go

1110
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:07,150
Ninth uncle, we'll be leaving

1111
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:08,990
Ninth uncle, see you

1112
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,828
Don't worry, it'll be alright

1113
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:15,689
Ah Jiu, go and have something
to eat with him

1114
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:18,627
Xiao De, you stay

1115
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:27,299
Xiao De, do you realise

1116
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:28,707
what your brother has done for you?

1117
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:31,036
You've got yourself into big trouble

1118
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:33,548
Never mess with them again

1119
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:34,980
otherwise I won't be able to save you

1120
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:39,518
Yes, Ninth uncle

1121
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:51,799
Don't move, police

1122
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:52,526
Officer Cheung, what's the matter?

1123
01:02:52,635 --> 01:02:53,294
Turn on the lights

1124
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:55,563
Ask the person in charge to come out

1125
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:56,399
Yes

1126
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:57,229
Look around

1127
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:58,773
Yes, you guys look over that side

1128
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,407
Come...

1129
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:03,501
Officer Cheung, what's the matter?

1130
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:05,310
Spot checking

1131
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:07,915
You should know better that
you can't do it here

1132
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:09,416
I've talked to you on the phone
about Xiao De

1133
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:10,508
How's it going?

1134
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:13,178
I talked to his big brotherjust now

1135
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,381
Let it go then

1136
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,120
Chief, what have you got?

1137
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,424
Most of them are juveniles

1138
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:20,553
Please do me a favour

1139
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:23,531
If I do, who's going to do me a favour?

1140
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:26,432
How's it?

1141
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:28,262
Alright

1142
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,039
Let's go back

1143
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:37,001
Go...

1144
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:54,824
Havert you cried enough?
You're crying for an hour

1145
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:05,229
Look at you, you look like a dirty cat

1146
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:06,503
Who's going to marry you?

1147
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:09,908
Disgusting

1148
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,916
Why are you smoking?

1149
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:23,385
It's been rotten luck these days

1150
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,685
My brother doesn't help me
when I'm in trouble

1151
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,727
I really wonder

1152
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:31,265
whether we have the same mother

1153
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:33,797
Xiao De

1154
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:42,974
Big Brother, those bastards are up there

1155
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:45,777
I want a leg of Xiao De, get it?

1156
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:47,046
Go

1157
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:56,253
That way

1158
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,555
Don't cry...

1159
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:06,798
Run

1160
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:08,664
Don't run

1161
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:28,755
Come out

1162
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:30,286
Let go of me

1163
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:33,385
Come here...

1164
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:34,258
No

1165
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:36,055
Come out

1166
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:37,632
No

1167
01:05:48,544 --> 01:05:49,374
He is not here

1168
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:50,240
Search everywhere

1169
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:59,547
Don't cry, please

1170
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:06,190
Nothing, look over there

1171
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:11,694
Found anything? No

1172
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:17,937
Nothing

1173
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,439
That's weird, look over there

1174
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:49,929
It's so dark

1175
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:52,936
Ah Fu

1176
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:53,838
What is it?

1177
01:06:54,377 --> 01:06:54,900
Look over here

1178
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:55,705
Alright

1179
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:08,652
I'll have a look

1180
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:14,090
Come up here

1181
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,212
Where are you running to?

1182
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:34,239
Go

1183
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:35,278
Don't run

1184
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:39,246
Here

1185
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:40,049
Hurry, run

1186
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:43,689
Big brother

1187
01:07:43,793 --> 01:07:44,782
Break his leg

1188
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:45,957
Attack

1189
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:56,798
Xiao De

1190
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:03,300
Xiao De

1191
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:07,279
Xiao De, stop fighting

1192
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:16,255
Xiao De

1193
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:20,895
Run, hurry, run

1194
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:27,631
Hurry

1195
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:29,433
Hurry

1196
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:39,739
Ah Ling, come here

1197
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:43,174
No, I'm scared

1198
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:44,248
Hurry, they are coming

1199
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:54,460
Help, Xiao De... help me

1200
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:55,120
Hold tight

1201
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:57,062
Help me, Xiao De

1202
01:08:57,933 --> 01:09:01,664
Xiao De, hurry and pull me up

1203
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:02,566
Hold tight

1204
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:08,200
Xiao De, help me

1205
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:09,874
Hold tight

1206
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:14,610
Xiao De, help me

1207
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:23,886
Xiao De, help me

1208
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:27,855
Ah Ling

1209
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:43,073
Hurry, go

1210
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:56,591
Ah Ling...

1211
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,270
Ah Ling

1212
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:17,605
Bastard

1213
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:23,115
Xiao De, come out here

1214
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:28,079
Xiao De, come out here

1215
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:35,155
Xiao De, come out here...

1216
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:00,153
Alright, stay in touch on the phone

1217
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:01,947
Brother

1218
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:04,122
What? Had a fight?

1219
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:07,161
No, Ah Ling fell to her death

1220
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:53,369
Mrs. Cheung

1221
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:56,136
What are you doing here?

1222
01:11:58,147 --> 01:11:59,341
I've brought him to Officer Cheung

1223
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:00,309
Let me in

1224
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:04,951
Officer Cheung

1225
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:17,398
Officer Cheung, I'm handing
my brother to you

1226
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:31,204
Officer Cheung, today we are here

1227
01:12:31,313 --> 01:12:32,405
to give you an explanation

1228
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:35,909
No more tricks

1229
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:43,189
I must beat him up today

1230
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,494
until you ask me to stop

1231
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,128
What? Can't do it?

1232
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:36,399
No, stop beating

1233
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:38,104
I'll call the police if you don't

1234
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:03,164
Don't mess with my affairs from now on

1235
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:22,285
Are you alright?

1236
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:26,019
I'll take you to a doctor

1237
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,698
Brother Da De...

1238
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:42,565
What happened?

1239
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:43,638
Just now a gang came looking for trouble

1240
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:44,728
even when I mentioned your name

1241
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:45,829
they didn't back down

1242
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:47,469
Brother Da De, we'll go and find them

1243
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:48,235
Right

1244
01:15:48,343 --> 01:15:50,971
Da De, where have you been?

1245
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:54,507
You see our club has been messed up

1246
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:55,844
We couldn't even find you

1247
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:57,081
When they came

1248
01:15:57,185 --> 01:15:58,982
they said they were here to
teach you a lesson

1249
01:15:59,454 --> 01:16:00,853
What was I supposed to do?

1250
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:02,753
Didrt even know who they were?

1251
01:16:02,858 --> 01:16:04,621
Before going they said
their big brother was Yi Ching

1252
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:09,329
Uncle Biu, I'm so sorry about the mess

1253
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:10,557
I must leave

1254
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:13,562
Brother Da De

1255
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:28,144
You're suffering, I'll give you a shot

1256
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:37,891
No...

1257
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:44,128
No...

1258
01:16:57,145 --> 01:16:57,873
What happened?

1259
01:16:58,547 --> 01:16:59,138
I'm asking you

1260
01:16:59,247 --> 01:16:59,679
Go away

1261
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:00,406
What if I don't?

1262
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:12,020
Don't move

1263
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:16,593
Don't move

1264
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:23,227
You two brothers are equally low and mean

1265
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:25,263
I'm charging you for unlawful
possession of weapons

1266
01:17:25,374 --> 01:17:26,966
causing injury to others

1267
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:28,736
There's evidence, so you can't deny it

1268
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:35,874
Our affairs should have all been settled

1269
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:38,475
Shut up, this is official business

1270
01:18:14,556 --> 01:18:15,887
Da De, someone is here for you

1271
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:18,755
Hurry and go

1272
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:36,834
Ninth Uncle, thank you for visiting me

1273
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,106
You asked me to look for Xiao De,
but I can't find him

1274
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:46,353
Don't worry, I'll definitely find him

1275
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:37,494
You've lost your family because of cocaine

1276
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,740
If he won't take, we'll surround
& smoke him with it

1277
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:42,139
so that even by smelling, he'll get hooked

1278
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:44,542
I grew up among drug addicts

1279
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:45,476
how come I didn't get hooked?

1280
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:55,622
Still can't find my little brother?

1281
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:57,389
He's nowhere to be found

1282
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:06,662
Ninth uncle, I want to see him,
please help

1283
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:26,472
Get into the car

1284
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:45,659
Da De, don't you want to see your brother?

1285
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:48,898
Get into the car quickly

1286
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:02,541
Officer Cheung, for two?
You're free today?

1287
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:06,416
Over here please

1288
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:09,920
What would you like to drink?

1289
01:22:10,025 --> 01:22:10,753
Later

1290
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:11,484
Alright

1291
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:15,386
Where's my brother?

1292
01:22:15,764 --> 01:22:17,891
Be patient, we'll talk about it
after this show

1293
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:53,934
What happened to you? Hurry

1294
01:22:55,236 --> 01:23:04,304
Hurry...

1295
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:08,940
You think I'm cheap, I'll show you
how cheap I can be

1296
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:34,232
Boss, leaving now? Come again

1297
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:25,885
Who are you looking for?

1298
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:27,291
Where's the one who performed with you?

1299
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:29,625
That drug addict? He's in the washroom

1300
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:36,768
Xiao De

1301
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:42,209
Xiao De... what happened to you?

1302
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:51,446
Xiao De

1303
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,258
Why do you do that?

1304
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:00,651
Say whatever you want to say

1305
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:01,660
Xiao De

1306
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:06,030
Xiao De

1307
01:25:09,737 --> 01:25:10,999
Xiao De

1308
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:17,171
You can'tjust die like that...

1309
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:18,108
Xiao De

1310
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:25,509
You can't die like that, Xiao De

1311
01:25:27,388 --> 01:25:30,789
Xiao De, don't die

1312
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:43,801
Alright, it's done

1313
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:48,062
Don't move

1314
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:51,397
Do you hear me?

1315
01:26:55,543 --> 01:26:56,100
Don't move

1316
01:26:56,644 --> 01:26:57,804
Good, take him back

1317
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:01,740
Officer Cheung, after months of
investigation we found

1318
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:02,873
that you abuse your powers
for personal revenge

1319
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:04,975
You tried to get Xiao De hooked

1320
01:27:05,086 --> 01:27:05,745
You know the law and you broke it

1321
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:07,377
This is something that cannot be tolerated

1322
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:10,323
I am sorry, I must arrest you now

1323
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:11,949
Please hand over your pistol and badge

1324
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:19,591
So you caused the death of my brother

1325
01:27:20,668 --> 01:27:21,396
Be calm

1326
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:23,999
He will be judged

1327
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:25,472
Take him back

1328
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,535
Sir, there are dead bodies in the washroom

1329
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:31,208
Call a car, leave two men behind
to finish the job

1330
01:27:31,312 --> 01:27:32,108
Yes

1331
01:27:32,547 --> 01:27:33,309
Take them away

1332
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,245
Go...
