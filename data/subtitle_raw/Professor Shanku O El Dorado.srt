1
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,330
Good evening.

2
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,290
No time to chat today, Tarak.
Very busy.

3
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,870
A cup of tea for me.

4
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,500
Won't take too much of your time.

5
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,450
What's it this time?

6
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,750
Is it a story or an essay?

7
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,580
Neither.

8
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,620
What is this?

9
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,750
- It's a diary.
- Diary?

10
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,080
Give it a read.

11
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,950
Gold mine!

12
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,450
Professor T. Shanku.
2016... 2?

13
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,830
Maybe, this was his second diary
of that year.

14
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,080
But does the name sound familiar?

15
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,910
T. Shanku?

16
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,540
Meaning?

17
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,040
Trilokeshwar Shanku.

18
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,410
Scientist and inventor.

19
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,540
He used to live in Giridih.

20
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,250
He's been missing for a few years now.

21
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,540
But this is a recent diary. 2016.

22
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:58,330
The initial rumours were that he lost his life
during a very dangerous experiment.

23
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,580
But I've also heard...

24
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:05,500
he's hiding in an undisclosed location
in India...

25
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,910
and continuing his work
in secret.

26
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,870
He'll reveal himself at the right time.

27
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,250
The diary's date makes
the second option seem correct.

28
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,580
But where did you find this?

29
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,700
Remember the meteorite
that hit the Suderbans?

30
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,370
Meteorite...the Sunderbans...

31
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,410
Oh ho!

32
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,080
A meteorite crashed in the Mathariya area
about three months back.

33
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,660
How can you forget already?

34
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,120
Oh, yes! Correct!
I remember now.

35
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,790
The media went crazy.

36
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,160
Of course, they did.

37
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,870
It was a huge stone.

38
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,750
- But how is this diary--
- Related?

39
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,500
I'll tell you, brother...

40
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,910
So, I had gone to the place...

41
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,000
To Mathariya?

42
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,370
First, I found an monitor lizard's skin.

43
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:33,500
I thought, since so many animals have died,
I might find some tiger skins too.

44
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,660
You get really good price for it.

45
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,000
But I was too late.

46
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,410
Didn't even find a deer.

47
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,830
- Then what happened?
- Then...

48
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,200
You found the diary in the meteorite crater?

49
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,790
Does that mean...

50
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,200
You won't find the answer
to that mystery in there.

51
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,370
You can read it
if you want.

52
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,660
You people are used to making up stories.

53
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,290
I write too.

54
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,040
This is much more interesting
and adventurous.

55
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,370
Not just that...

56
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,620
The ink that has been used
to write in this diary...

57
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,290
It's a strange ink.

58
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,410
How?

59
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,250
You've seen the diary.

60
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,910
What's the colour of the ink?

61
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,830
Why? It's black.

62
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,700
Open it and see.

63
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,580
Take another look.

64
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,870
What?

65
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,950
This is...
But it was just...

66
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,410
Didn't I tell you...

67
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,750
An ageless inventor!

68
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,250
Now stare at the writing for some time.

69
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,290
I would have never parted with it,
you know.

70
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,660
I'm under a lot of financial stress,
that's why.

71
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,200
Thank you.

72
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,290
May God bless you.

73
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,790
Goodbye.

74
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,370
Yeah, tell me.

75
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,500
Is the proof ready, Samaresh?

76
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,910
What?

77
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,040
The proof?

78
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,330
Oh, yes...

79
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,750
Meet me in an hour.

80
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,080
Okay.

81
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,040
May, 1st.

82
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,830
Today, I finally received the new issue
of the "Cosmos" magazine.

83
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:54,450
This famous Swedish journal
has printed one of my essays.

84
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,950
I had discussed all my inventions
in the essay.

85
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,450
I had never done this before.

86
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:10,830
Although, I've received many requests
from various publications from all over the world.

87
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,660
I had to reject them all
due to lack of time.

88
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:22,160
I have cut down a lot
on my research work nowadays.

89
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:28,750
I have realised that in a place like Giridih...

90
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,700
with the limited resources of my laboratory...

91
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,450
it's not like nothing can be achieved today...

92
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,410
but there's no need.

93
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:45,290
However, I had the opportunity
to explain something in this essay.

94
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:53,580
The reason I did not make my inventions
public to the world.

95
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,370
There's just one reason.

96
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:02,620
My most important inventions...

97
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,540
like the Annihilin Pistol or the Miracurall medicine...

98
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,120
or the Omniscope or the Microsonograph...

99
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,290
or the memory revival machine, Remembrane...

100
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,330
None of these can be built in a factory.

101
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,700
These are all human handiwork.

102
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,200
And there is only man who can do it.

103
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,080
And that's Trilokeshwar Shanku.

104
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,950
Congratulations!

105
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:51,250
Your article in the "Cosmos" magazine
has caused quite a stir in the world of science.

106
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,540
Is that so?

107
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,580
Yeah, yeah!

108
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,200
And the people that know you...

109
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,410
They are all saying
what you've done is incredible!

110
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,910
Considering the little resources
you've down there at Giridih.

111
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,370
Take for example, the very means by which
we're presently communicating.

112
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,410
This is also your invention.

113
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,660
Holocon: holographic conference.

114
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,370
Now, let's cut to the chase.

115
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:17,620
You've heard of Sao Paolo's famous Ratantan Institute,
I presume.

116
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,200
Of course, I have.

117
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,370
It's president, Professor Emilia Rodriguez...

118
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,290
is a good friend to both of us.

119
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,040
And we've talked to her
earlier this morning.

120
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,830
And she told us she has read your article.

121
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,540
And obviously she is fascinated.

122
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,290
Now, let me tell you
about the decision she has taken.

123
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,540
Coming August, a science conference
is being organised in Sao Paolo.

124
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,750
From the 25th to the 28th.

125
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,950
It'll be the usual seminars
and panel discussions.

126
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,120
And besides all that,
on the last day of the conference...

127
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,040
the institute will present you
with a doctorate.

128
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,080
What?

129
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,160
And wait!
It doesn't end there.

130
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,830
An exhibition is being planned
to showcase some of your favourite inventions

131
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,410
alongwith their
necessary research papers.

132
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,120
And you two are invited
to the conference, I hope.

133
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,450
Of course. Emilia will be sending the official invitations
by email as well as by post.

134
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,000
I've never been to Brazil.

135
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,330
Yes, we know.

136
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,120
And when we told her that...

137
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,250
she said that our stay won't end
in just three days.

138
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,620
They're organising a week's tour of Brazil
after the conference is over.

139
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:30,950
Oh, that's wonderful!
I couldn't have asked for anything better.

140
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,410
Alright. Let us know
when you get the invitation.

141
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,160
And we'll contact you
with any additional information.

142
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,330
Great! Thank you. Thank you.

143
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,950
Bye, Shanku. Take care.

144
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,500
- 'Auf wiedersehen'. Bye, Jeremy.
- Bye, Will.

145
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,790
A gentleman is here to meet you.

146
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,540
Which nationality?

147
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,450
I didn't ask.

148
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,700
But he is wearing a dhoti and cotton kurta.

149
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,700
And he spoke in Bengali.

150
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,040
What did he say?

151
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,500
Tell your master to stop reading the article
in "kishmish".

152
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,410
And spare ten minutes of his time.

153
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,700
He wants to tell you something.

154
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,540
- Ask him to sit in the verandah.
- Okay, sir.

155
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,790
Hello, Tilu.

156
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:51,580
I apologize for interrupting
your reading of "Cosmos".

157
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,370
I've come here with the deep desire
to discuss certain things with you.

158
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,830
I'm sure you'll listen to my request.

159
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
- Sit.
- Yes.

160
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,580
You must be a little surprised.

161
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,330
The fact that I've written in "Cosmos"...

162
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,660
No one here knows about that.

163
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,700
And only my father called me Tilu.

164
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,910
After he passed away,
the nickname had no use.

165
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,620
My name is Nakur Chandra Biswas.

166
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,870
I live in Makardah.

167
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,660
I could see you in front of me
for the last few days.

168
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,830
But that and this is not the same thing.

169
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,620
You could see me?

170
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,160
What do you mean?

171
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:54,290
It's been like this
for the last one and half months.

172
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,200
People from different places,
events from different places...

173
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,370
I can suddenly see these things.

174
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,790
Although, it's not very clear.
But I can still see.

175
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,910
I've heard your name.

176
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,160
I've seen your photo in the newspapers too.

177
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,620
The moment I tried to remember what you looked like
you were right there in front of me.

178
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,910
Hmm.

179
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:21,370
And this has been going on
for a month and a half?

180
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:26,500
Almost a month and a half.

181
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,250
It was raining very heavily that day.

182
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,620
It was afternoon.

183
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,620
My brother was at the school.

184
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,250
He teaches in Makardah Primary School.

185
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,830
Our mother has passed away.

186
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,370
My father was at Noni Ghosh's house
playing chess.

187
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,540
I was having some tamarind chutney
in my room.

188
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,660
Suddenly, I see.

189
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,330
In all probablity...

190
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:57,040
you are talking about ball lightning.

191
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,790
Ball lightning?

192
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,910
It's a very rare event.
But it does happen.

193
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:06,540
But if that electricity passes
very close to a person...

194
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,750
and if certain changes are seen in the person
because of that...

195
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,330
then nothing else could be said.

196
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,500
On that note, would you like some coffee?

197
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,660
Would hate to disturb Prahlad...

198
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,290
It's no bother at all.
I'll give you company.

199
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,830
Prahlad! Prahlad!

200
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,290
Coming, sir.

201
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,160
Please bring us two coffees.

202
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:35,160
3-8-8-8-9-1-7-1...

203
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,040
Nakur?

204
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,910
3-8-8-8-9-1-7-1.

205
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,950
The news of death in the paper.

206
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:53,200
The wall on the right
of the victim's table...

207
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,290
There's a painting.

208
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:02,910
Hidden behind it is a safe.

209
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,160
And the number you mentioned?

210
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,830
That's the passkey
to open the safe.

211
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:12,500
If you enter the number
the safe will open.

212
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,660
It's stuffed with legal documents...

213
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,580
important papers
and bundles of dollar notes.

214
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,660
Please don't mind me, Tilu.

215
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,370
I don't want to waste your precious time
by talking about all this...

216
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,500
Not at all!

217
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,540
You have a rare gift.

218
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:45,910
Any scientist would be fortunate
to meet you.

219
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,870
I just want to know...

220
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:53,790
What are the other traits that developed in me
after I came in contact with the ball lightning?

221
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,450
- Am I right?
- Absolutely!

222
00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:00,410
Problem is I don't consider
these special abilities.

223
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,450
It's as normal as breathing.

224
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,580
I'm not thinking about it as special ability
while I'm doing it.

225
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:12,580
For example, on the table in front of you...

226
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,790
What? What can you see?

227
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:29,330
A brass Budhha statue...

228
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:35,700
It's not very clear...
just an illusion.

229
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,160
Like I said...

230
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,410
I'm still not very good at it.

231
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,790
The statue is in Makardah.

232
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,200
It's in our lawyer,
Shibratan Mallik's chamber.

233
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,910
I've seen it only once.

234
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:00,620
I imagined it on your table.

235
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,000
But it didn't completely show up.

236
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:09,290
I could see you often...

237
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:12,790
that's why I thought
I'll visit you in Giridih.

238
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,790
I'll have chat with you...

239
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,660
- Here you go.
- Yes...

240
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:24,450
I wanted to warn you about something.

241
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,700
- Warning!
- Pardon my insolence.

242
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:34,700
I know you don't just belong to this country.
You're respected through out the world.

243
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:41,080
You're invited all over the world
and you must respond to those invitations.

244
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:48,330
But if you attend the Sao Paulo conference,
I'd request you to be especially careful.

245
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:50,410
What about Sao Paulo?

246
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,580
I can't tell you that.

247
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,250
It's still not very clear to me yet.

248
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:04,200
And to tell you the truth,
I don't even know where Sao Paulo is.

249
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:11,290
Sao Paulo is the biggest city
in South America's biggest country, Brazil.

250
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:16,790
Oh, I suddenly saw...

251
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,250
My heart shuddered.

252
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,580
And the very next moment I saw...

253
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,660
- What did you see?
- A garden...

254
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,000
And a beautiful restaurant in it...

255
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:40,330
That man didn't have a good aura.

256
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,370
- Where are you putting up?
- Huh?

257
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,080
Where are you staying?

258
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,330
Hotel Manorama.

259
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
How long will you stay?

260
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,790
My work here is done.
So...

261
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,120
How can I get in touch with you?

262
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,830
Well, I have a mobile phone.

263
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,000
- You do?
- Yes.

264
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,120
Then give me your number.

265
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,160
Let me give you a call instead.

266
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,200
I have your number saved.

267
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,080
How do you have my number?

268
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,290
Oh!

269
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,290
I should have guessed.
Please go ahead.

270
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,450
I've saved your number as well.

271
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:40,790
Tell me something.

272
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,830
What?

273
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,500
Would you go abroad
if you get the opportunity?

274
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,580
Abroad? Me?

275
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,200
It means a lot
that you've even considered me.

276
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,000
I don't need anything else.

277
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,040
Please accept my salutations!

278
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,750
And my blessings for Newton.

279
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,370
It's unbelieveable!

280
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:14,330
Mr. Biswas seems to have been blessed
with the power of hypnotism...

281
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,950
telepathy and clairvoyance.

282
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,200
Tell me, do you believe in his theory
about ball lightning?

283
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,290
What other explaination can there be?

284
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,700
To be honest...

285
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,870
I've read about instances
where by being close to a lightning strike

286
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:32,160
the deaf could hear again...
The blind could see again but...

287
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,080
Anyway, I've got the email
from Sao Paulo.

288
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,830
Oh, I'm glad to hear it!

289
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,620
Listen, Shanku...

290
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:44,370
Why don't you take Mr. Biswas along with you
to Sao Paulo as your secretary?

291
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,620
God, Wil! Instead of being a scientist
you should have been...

292
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,950
Oh, no, no, sorry, Jeremy.
But I have an open mind.

293
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,410
I'm not joking, Shanku.

294
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,580
If you take him along with you
we can see a demonstration of his powers.

295
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,080
And above that, he can participate
on some TV talk shows...

296
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,580
And he will return to his place
with some money in his pocket.

297
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,910
Come on. Think about it.

298
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,700
Let's see.

299
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,080
If I find him excited at the prospect,
I'll let you know.

300
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,080
Okay, that's that!

301
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,950
- Keep us posted. Bye.
- Bye.

302
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,330
Bye.

303
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,160
Tell me, Nakur.

304
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,450
The invitation is already here
from Sao Paulo.

305
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,370
Oh, yes.

306
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,660
Actually...

307
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,660
I was feeling a little awkward at the prospect
of going abroad with you at first.

308
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,120
But now gradually
I've come to realise...

309
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:38,870
that if I'm not there with you
at Sao Paulo, you'll be...

310
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,620
in great danger. That's why...

311
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,540
Well then, I'll let them know.

312
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,620
That my secretary, NC Biswas
will be travelling with me.

313
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,700
And a separate invitation
should be sent for him.

314
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:01,580
SREEGURU LIBRARY

315
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,120
One more thing...

316
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:19,370
At least, three days before leaving
that is August 22nd...

317
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,700
It would be great
if you could come to Giridih.

318
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:27,080
We must evaluate your sensibilities.

319
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,540
Welcome! Welcome!

320
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,160
Good morning, Tilu!

321
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,580
Good morning.

322
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,660
You are looking great.

323
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,580
Result of praticising yoga.

324
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,450
Take a seat.
Two coffees, please.

325
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,290
Yes, sir.

326
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,410
What else have you been doing?

327
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,450
My English is more fluent now.

328
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:05,160
And I've learnt Pitman's short hand method.

329
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:10,870
And I've read a few books on etiquettes
to get used to the culture abroad.

330
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:13,660
Your letter of recommendation
helped me get the passport.

331
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,620
And see this.

332
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,500
Apart from the suit
I got from Kolkata...

333
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:30,250
I also got shirts, tie, handkerchief,
shoes and socks.

334
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,620
I've made you spend a lot of money.

335
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,540
Don't worry about it.

336
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,250
My father, his friend Noni Ghosh,
lawyer Shibratan Mallik...

337
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,200
Everyone has heard of you.

338
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,830
They were so happy
that I was going abroad with you...

339
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,160
that they lent me some money.

340
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,290
And my brother lent me this suitcase.

341
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,160
Did you have to buy this too?

342
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,750
What to do?
I normally use neem stems.

343
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,410
Nakur...

344
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,290
Yes?

345
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:09,370
You might want to read it.
Might find it helpful.

346
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,870
- I won't need it.
- What do you mean?

347
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:23,370
I found an old book with pictures
in my local library about Brazil.

348
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,950
I have read it cover to cover.

349
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,290
There's only one problem.

350
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,660
And what might that be?

351
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,620
I can still speak a little bit of English.

352
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:38,330
The book said the official language
of Brazil is Portuguese. That is...

353
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:41,830
You don't have to worry about that.
I'm here.

354
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,750
You know Portuguese too?

355
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:48,080
Considering the deep impact
of the Portuguese culture on Indian history...

356
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,160
When I was 11 years old...

357
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:56,870
I had learned the language from Portuguese Pastor,
Father Rebello.

358
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,330
Which is why I consider you such a genius.

359
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,660
Will we travel to the forests of Brazil?

360
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,370
They have promised to take us around.

361
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,540
Will forests be excluded?

362
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,910
I have read about the forests there.

363
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:17,750
It talks about a species of snake
that is double the size of a python.

364
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,790
- Anaconda.
- Correct. Exactly that.

365
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,540
- Welcome to Brazil.
- Jeremy, it's been a long time.

366
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,700
Oh yes!

367
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,830
- Shanku!
- Wilhelm!

368
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,200
- You look good... Thank you.
- And you too.

369
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,660
This is Mr. Lobo.
He's Emilia's secretary.

370
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,500
- 'Olá'!
- Hi!

371
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,660
It's an honour, sir.

372
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,160
Thank you.

373
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,410
He has been given the burden
of looking after us.

374
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,830
Really?

375
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,910
And this is the great NC Biswas.

376
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,620
- Hi!
- Hello.

377
00:31:59,080 --> 00:31:59,750
Yes.

378
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,000
They are my closest and oldest friends.

379
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,410
They can't speak Bengali
but they understand it quite well.

380
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,410
A little bit.

381
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,120
Jeremy Saunders.

382
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,870
- Hello.
- Hello.

383
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,950
Wilhelm Kroll.

384
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,000
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello--

385
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,160
What's wrong?

386
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:23,870
Alps...

387
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,200
Bavarian Alps...

388
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,290
You and two young men...

389
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,750
The year 1972...

390
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,080
Climbing...

391
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,250
Climbing...

392
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,160
Then slipping...slipping...slipping...

393
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,370
Then...oh...

394
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,950
Bad...

395
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,700
Very bad.

396
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,700
My foot slipped.
(in German)

397
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,120
Trying to save my life...

398
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,830
Hermann and Karl lost theirs.

399
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,120
He's saying...

400
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,160
Two of his friends in an attempt to save him...

401
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:12,910
The entire incident played out
in front of my eyes.

402
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,290
I didn't want to say anything.

403
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,040
It's a very tragic incident.

404
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,750
Excuse me. The car is waiting for us.

405
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,290
Come... Let's go.

406
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,910
Come, Wil.

407
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,950
Did you know about this event of Wil's youth?

408
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,410
No.

409
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,410
Mr. Biswas.

410
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,370
Thank you.

411
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,250
- Mr. Shanku.
- Thank you.

412
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,410
Professor Rodriguez.

413
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,450
You're very kind to me.

414
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,580
Yes.

415
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,580
I have to go.
I'll call you back.

416
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,870
Sao Paulo welcomes you.

417
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,000
Thank you.

418
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:52,700
Thank you.

419
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,500
So happy.

420
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,410
- And I see you've met up with your old friends.
- Yes, I have.

421
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,330
Wonderful! Wonderful!

422
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,620
We're so deeply honoured
to have you here.

423
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:04,540
This is my secretary, NC Biswas.

424
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,250
Ah!

425
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,830
- Hello.
- Pleasure... Pleasure.

426
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:10,830
And has Professor Shanku
received his itinerary?

427
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:11,790
It's in his room, yes.

428
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,290
Wonderful. Alright and...

429
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,700
All of your research materials
have arrived safely.

430
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,250
And we've set up and organised the exhibition
according to your instructions.

431
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,540
- That's excellent.
- Great!

432
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,160
So, I hope you'll be happy with it.

433
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,910
Yes, I'm sure I will.

434
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:24,700
Alright then.

435
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,700
I should let you get a bit of rest
after this long journey.

436
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,330
Jetlag doesn't affect Shanku.

437
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,370
It doesn't?

438
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,950
Absolutely not.

439
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:36,620
Didn't you read about the Nervigour
in the "Cosmos" article?

440
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,580
But, of course, your nerve invigorating pill.

441
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,450
Right?

442
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,410
This is the place I saw where...

443
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:52,620
Where?

444
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,290
Where the foreigner is going to sit with you.

445
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,370
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

446
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,830
Sir.

447
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,870
The conference will be inaugrated
with the seminar...

448
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,410
involving the three of you today at five p.m.

449
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,040
Oh!

450
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,370
- Your itinerary.
- Hmm.

451
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,120
Excuse me.

452
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,950
Wonderful.

453
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,700
We're right beside you.

454
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,410
I'm in 3421 and Wil is in...

455
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,870
3423.

456
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,120
Two, one... Two, three...

457
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,750
Will you be requiring anything else, sir?

458
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,870
No, I don't think so.
Not at the moment.

459
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,500
After the conference is over though...

460
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,290
I think we'd all like a tour of the rainforest.

461
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,500
Good idea!

462
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,450
Of course.

463
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,580
Okay...

464
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,160
Ladies and gentlemen...

465
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,830
our discussion must end here for tonight.

466
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:28,870
The next event will take place
in the adjacent room.

467
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:32,750
And it'll be an exhibition of a select few...

468
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,950
of the world famous Indian scientist

469
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,910
Trilokeshwar Shanku's most amazing inventions.

470
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:41,660
Alongwith their supporting research papers.

471
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:47,200
And for this the Ratantan Institute
is forever grateful to him.

472
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:52,370
Not only is Prof. Shanku here to take part
in these talks and discussions...

473
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,830
He is also our chief guest.

474
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,410
This is because on the final day of our conference...

475
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,250
we'll present a doctorate to him.

476
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,870
And it's Prof. Shanku's wish
that today's exhibition...

477
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,040
be inaugarated by his two closest friends.

478
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,330
Yes.

479
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,950
We're deeply touched, Shanku.

480
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,540
Indeed, we are.

481
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,000
After you... Come.

482
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,700
Professor Trilokeshwar Shanku
was born in Giridih…

483
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,620
This way.

484
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:29,540
...a border town of the state of Jharkhand, India
in the year 1945.

485
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,580
(narration in Portuguese)

486
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:38,870
It's been a while since I have seen
anyone write in shorthand.

487
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,790
Oh, my secretary, Biswas.

488
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,700
He's been learning Pitman.

489
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,620
You know something...

490
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,660
All these documents and blueprints
have been lying locked up...

491
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,250
in my cabinets in Giridih
all this time away from prying eyes.

492
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:58,000
Suddenly, to see them exhibited
for the public...

493
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,370
here in Brazil is...

494
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,080
But what Professor Shanku is famous worldwide
for is as an inventor.

495
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,620
He has been recognised as the greatest inventor
since Thomas Alva Edison…

496
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,250
by scientists from five continents.

497
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,040
Shanku is single.

498
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,250
His family includes his beloved cat, Newton…

499
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:21,080
and his faithful manservant, Prahlad.

500
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:29,830
The two of us were initially
having second thoughts

501
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:34,410
about whether bringing
all your precious research papers here...

502
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,540
so far from home was a wise decision.

503
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,500
But after seeing the level of security...

504
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,950
that was levied for the safekeeping...
made me much more at ease.

505
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:45,910
Me too.

506
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,160
- More coffee?
- Yes, please.

507
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,410
You know they produce very good coffee
in this country.

508
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,700
Yes!

509
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,910
I can see that.

510
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,790
I definitely want to take some back
when I go back home.

511
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,450
Good morning!

512
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:03,160
- Professor T. Shanku?
- Yes.

513
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:06,000
- Solomon Bloomgarten.
- Hello.

514
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,500
Nice to meet you.

515
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,450
Can we have a talk in private?

516
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,200
A talk?

517
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,500
About what?

518
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,080
I won't take up too much of your time.

519
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,330
Maybe, we can sit at my table.

520
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:18,830
Alright.

521
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,160
Excuse me.

522
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,200
Excuse us, gentlemen.

523
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,830
Have a seat.

524
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:40,120
So, Mr. Garden...

525
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:41,830
Bloom... Bloomgarten.

526
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,000
- Mr. Bloomgarten.
- Call me Sol.

527
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,580
And I'll call you Shank
if you don't mind.

528
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,830
- You'll call me Shank?
- Shank.

529
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,200
Alright, Sol. Let's talk.

530
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,870
After reading your article
in the "Cosmos" magazine...

531
00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:00,000
I've had this desire
to meet with you in person.

532
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,620
When I heard that you're coming here...

533
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,000
I couldn't contain myself anymore.

534
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:09,000
First thing I did on arriving
was to go and see your exhibition.

535
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,330
Impressive!

536
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,580
- Very impressive!
- Thank you.

537
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:15,250
- But I have some questions.
- Go ahead.

538
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:20,660
Can your Annihilin pistol really wipe
every living thing out of existence?

539
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,700
It can.

540
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:22,750
Oh!

541
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:26,540
And your Omniscope glasses,
can they function as a microscope?

542
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:30,330
- A telescope...and
- X-ray device...yes it can.

543
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,120
X-ray device...brilliant.

544
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:37,540
And your Miracurall pill?
Can it cure any and all diseases?

545
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:43,040
Well, a couple of pills a day can cure
any disease in two days.

546
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,500
Amongst all the diseases,
can it cure cancer too?

547
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:50,540
It depends on the stage the cancer is at.

548
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,870
What about the Miracurall ointment?

549
00:41:53,870 --> 00:42:00,200
It can be used to cure snake bites,
injuries, scratches...

550
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,000
you know that kind of thing.

551
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:17,700
This is the result of a minor car accident I had
about two months ago.

552
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,750
And it still bothers me.

553
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,200
There's a burning pain.

554
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,290
Is that the famous ointment?

555
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:32,040
Well, I like to carry some of my inventions
with me all the time.

556
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,830
Holy smoke! This is amazing!

557
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:01,700
Now I know everything I need to know.

558
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:08,580
Shank, I'm willing to buy the patents
of all four of your inventions immediately.

559
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:13,700
And I'm willing to pay you
one million dollars for them.

560
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,370
- Sorry, Sol. Not interested.
- Wait, Shank... Please sit...

561
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:47,000
What are you getting from keeping
all this incredible inventions so secret?

562
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,790
Why are you being so selfish?

563
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:51,450
Are you really interested in...

564
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:55,200
Are you really interested
in the public welfare?

565
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,830
Your interest is in the commercial side
of things...

566
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:02,620
and how you can use my inventions in those.
Isn't it?

567
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,870
Shank, I'm a businessman.

568
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,000
So I'll look at anything
from a business perspective.

569
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,120
What's so surprising about that?

570
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,000
But I am not going to leave you hanging.

571
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,580
I have a cheque book with me right now.

572
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,330
Or if you prefer cash,
that can be managed.

573
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:20,290
Let me tell you something, Sol.

574
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:24,870
None of my inventions,
especially the four you mentioned...

575
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,950
can be manufactured in a factory
using machines.

576
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,540
Do you understand that?

577
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,080
I don't believe you.

578
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:35,000
Then there's nothing I can do about that.

579
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,950
Shank, I'll double my price.

580
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,500
Sol, Sol, Sol...

581
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:46,120
Even if you offered me 20 million instead of one
my answer would still be the same.

582
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,450
- Shank!
- Tilu...

583
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:50,540
- Tilu, you are in...
- What's the matter, Nakur?

584
00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:00,750
El... El Dorado...

585
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,450
El Dorado.

586
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,580
Who was that man?

587
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,160
My secretary.

588
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:15,000
Why did he all of a sudden bring up
El Dorado of all things?

589
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,250
He's done a lot of research on South America,
you see.

590
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:22,870
So, the fact that he should know
about El Dorado is not surprising.

591
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:27,160
My ancestors as well as I
on two different occasions in my youth...

592
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,540
have come here to look for El Dorado.

593
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:34,620
I didn't leave one single country
out of the search, you know.

594
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:37,500
Finally, I contracted a severe disease...

595
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,660
and I had to quit the search
for my beloved golden city.

596
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,000
And went home soon after.

597
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:45,750
Coming to Brazil after so long...

598
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:49,910
I was frequently reminded
of El Dorado yesterday.

599
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:51,450
And today.

600
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:55,370
Look Sol, nowadays, everybody knows
that El Dorado is a myth.

601
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:58,250
- So, there's absolutely no point--
- No, Shank.

602
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:01,700
I still believe El Dorado exists.

603
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:07,040
Anyway, I'm staying in this hotel in room 4422.

604
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,790
If you change your mind,
please let me know.

605
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:14,290
I don't see that happening,
Mr. Bloomgarten.

606
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,200
The nerve of him!

607
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,000
That rascal wants to buy patents
from you?

608
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,540
We also saw that you gave him
some demonstration.

609
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,620
What can I say?

610
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:30,290
We, scientists, can never resist the temptation
of showing off once in a while.

611
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:33,250
No, Shanku. You're too soft.

612
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:36,080
Which is why you have to deal with people
like him.

613
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,080
If he bothers you again, let us know.

614
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,830
We'll put him in his place.

615
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,540
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

616
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,620
I've finalised the tour of the rainforest
for you, sir.

617
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,370
- Really?
- Yes.

618
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:19,580
The day after tomorrow
after breakfast...

619
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:24,450
we'll be flying out north to Brasilia,
the capital of Brazil.

620
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:28,410
From there we're going to take a small plane
to a city called Posto Diauarum.

621
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:31,580
Located just north of the Xingu national forest.

622
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,950
The remainder of the journey will be by boat.

623
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,370
In Brasilia, we're going to be meeting up
a guide called Hyter.

624
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:40,330
He's quite a unique fellow.

625
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,660
We locally refer to him as a "sertanista"...

626
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:46,040
Sa-sa-satanista?

627
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:49,200
The word literally means forest specialist.

628
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:53,160
He has already been informed
about our arrival.

629
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,620
He'll give us more details of our trip
as soon as we arrive.

630
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,160
So you'll be coming with us?

631
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,370
How can I not?

632
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,620
Professor Rodriguez insisted.

633
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:06,160
Only when you're on a plane back home
will my task be complete.

634
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,080
What's the matter?

635
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,160
Please don't be offended,
but I couldn't stop myself.

636
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:30,910
When did this happen?

637
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:32,750
I fell down in a hurry.

638
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,700
Some water please.

639
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,910
The deed has been done.

640
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:41,830
What?

641
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,200
It's been done.

642
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,830
What are you talking about?

643
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:51,790
The research papers of your inventions...

644
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:54,790
The formulae of my inventions?

645
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:59,080
What nonsense are you talking about?

646
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,580
Did you dream about it?

647
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,500
It wasn't a dream!

648
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:07,120
The security guards were bribed...

649
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,500
He entered the exhibition...

650
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:12,330
- He has copied...
- He?

651
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,290
Who is he, Nakur?

652
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,540
Lobo?

653
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,910
Our very own.

654
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:39,750
Actually, I couldn't put my thoughts together
in a new place.

655
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:42,870
That's why Lobo...

656
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:48,290
Wait... I'll get something for you.

657
00:51:56,250 --> 00:52:00,700
After you get back to your room,
put this ointment on your forehead.

658
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:06,080
And take this pill now.

659
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,750
What is this?

660
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,040
Cerebrillant pill.

661
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:14,870
This will keep your head clear
and your emotions too.

662
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:27,000
But don't be scared.

663
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:33,700
I'll try my best so that no harm comes to you.

664
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:43,250
Is it possible for Lobo
to do this on his own?

665
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:45,500
I'm sure someone is behind this.

666
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,750
Of course.

667
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,830
A very rich man.

668
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,850
Very well done.

669
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:39,430
Thank you.

670
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:49,350
One sip is all you need to take, right?

671
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:53,850
So...

672
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:55,640
To Dr. Shanku!

673
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,220
- Doctor Shanku!
- Doctor Shanku!

674
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:07,050
Good evening!

675
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:12,720
- Good evening.
- Solomon Bloomgarten. And you are?

676
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,430
NC Biswas--

677
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:18,430
- You're Prof. Shanku's secretary.
- Yes.

678
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:23,470
Well Bis, the other day, I heard
you mention El Dorado.

679
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:25,720
What do you know about the city?

680
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:28,100
I'm not very educated.

681
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:29,930
Very ordinary man.

682
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:36,470
Yesterday, reading a Bengali book
on El Dorado.

683
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,970
Reading... Reading...

684
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:42,050
Then seeing the city.

685
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:44,600
In front of my eyes.

686
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,640
That is why...

687
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,970
Seeing the city?

688
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,510
El Dorado?

689
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,720
What a day!

690
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,010
But tell me where is your secretary?

691
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:01,100
He was somewhere inside
the last time I saw him.

692
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,930
You mean me, here, before, I?

693
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:09,140
No, no, no...

694
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,430
No...

695
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:15,430
- I was just talking to them...
- Come on... Scram.

696
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:17,930
Hi, congratulations!

697
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:20,640
Please, sit. Please.

698
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:27,720
Who is this secretary that you've brought?

699
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:28,680
Why?

700
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,760
This gentleman has got several talents.

701
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,350
He looked me in the eye
and told me everything about myself.

702
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,470
And I've told him I'll hand him over
to Myron.

703
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:39,600
He'll be rolling in riches overnight.

704
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,640
Your man will be owning a Tesla
in three months time.

705
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,430
Who's Myron?

706
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,430
Holy smoke!
You haven't heard of Myron?

707
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:52,180
Myron Enterprises. He's the best promoter
and manager there is.

708
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:59,300
His team of managers have established the careers
of musicians, dancers, singers, even magicians.

709
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,180
And he's already an exceptional man.

710
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:07,220
But most importantly,
he knows where El Dorado is!

711
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,720
What, sir?

712
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,010
Go on, Bis.
Tell them.

713
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:16,550
Have you told them that
you know where El Dorado is?

714
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:20,550
I've told them what I know.

715
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,640
Go, tell them man.

716
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,100
El Dorado is in Brazil.

717
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,220
Definite.

718
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:35,510
Inside very deep jungle...

719
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,300
Only I know...

720
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,720
Nobody knows.

721
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:41,800
Nobody stays.

722
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:44,010
Empty city.

723
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,300
But...

724
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,850
when Sun falls...

725
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:55,760
the city shines...

726
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:59,100
Golden gate...

727
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,140
Golden pillar...

728
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,260
Golden pyramid...

729
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:08,350
Door, window... All gold.

730
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:10,470
Then...

731
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:14,510
One time, 1000 years ago...

732
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,800
Heavy rain... very heavy...

733
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,470
Then...

734
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:26,100
deadly insects...
invade the jungle.

735
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,930
resulting in a cholera epidemic.

736
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:32,600
All people dead.

737
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:42,760
Believe me, Tilu, I saw everything play
in front of my eyes just like a movie.

738
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:46,010
Well! That's it then.

739
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:50,470
What remains now is for you to organise
an expedition to the Amazon.

740
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:53,850
For now we're very tired
and would like to leave.

741
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:55,470
Nakur...

742
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:59,800
Look, I'm telling you for your own good.

743
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:04,010
Please don't reveal your abilities
in front of random people.

744
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,930
What do you think?

745
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:10,300
Do you want to become a stage performer?

746
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:15,260
You're inexperienced
and you still don't know people.

747
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:19,550
But if you get stuck with Solomon
you'll be in great danger.

748
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:25,720
This is my request. Please don't jump
into things without speaking to me.

749
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,050
Please forgive me.

750
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:30,890
I've made a big mistake.

751
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,010
This is my first time in a foreign country.

752
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:36,220
I'm from a small town.

753
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:39,050
That's why I lost my mind.

754
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:43,720
You've done me a great favour
by warning me.

755
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:46,390
Okay, I'll take your leave.

756
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:52,800
We're leaving at 8 a.m.
Hope you remember.

757
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,100
Of course, yes.
I'll be at the lobby.

758
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,350
Did you understand anything?

759
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:07,140
Understood... A little.

760
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:12,850
Well, if El Dorado really exists...

761
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:16,140
Why don't we try to find it?

762
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,800
Incredible!

763
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:23,300
Even after its existence has clearly been proven
to be a myth.

764
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:29,430
Are you telling me that Biswas' words
have turned you into a believer?

765
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:33,350
But leaving all this...

766
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:36,890
If that rascal Solomon
wants to travel through the forest...

767
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:42,680
and become dinner to a tribe of cannibals,
I have no problem with that whatsoever.

768
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,260
But I'm not getting involved in all this.

769
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,640
I agree completely with that.

770
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,970
Let's stick to the plan.

771
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:52,350
Oh, thank heavens!

772
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,510
I'm so disappointed with you.

773
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:57,430
With me?

774
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:58,930
Why?

775
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:03,180
Because you seem not to realise
the potential of your ally...

776
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:07,800
Your secretary's eyes can see
beyond the mundane.

777
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:11,760
Ten minutes ago when he was telling us
about his vision of El Dorado...

778
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:17,600
I got so enraptured
that I couldn't take my eyes off him.

779
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:20,220
Good morning!
(in Portuguese)

780
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:22,220
Morning!

781
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:23,350
Good morning!

782
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:27,180
I trust you're aware that Mr. Biswas
checked out earlier this morning and left.

783
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:27,970
Right?

784
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:30,100
What did you just say?

785
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:34,390
Due to some apparently urgent work,
he had to leave the city for three days.

786
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:37,470
And this is for you.

787
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:39,720
Excuse me.

788
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:43,140
All check out formalities are done with.
I'll get the car.

789
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,970
- Okay.
- Okay.

790
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:48,010
Dear Tilu.

791
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:50,390
Please forgive me.

792
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:54,640
Couldn't control my urge
to get 20000 dollars.

793
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:58,390
We are leaving
on the gentleman's private plane.

794
01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:03,970
Our destination is a forest area
350 miles north-west of Sao Paolo.

795
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:07,970
That's where El Dorado is located.

796
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:13,850
The foreigner will not be able to reach
the golden city without my help.

797
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:18,850
I have been forced to give him the directions.

798
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:22,720
I'll join you once my work here is done.

799
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:25,550
I am aware your route.

800
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:28,140
May God bless you.

801
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:32,890
Yours faithfully,
Nakur Chandra Biswas.

802
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:34,800
Post script.

803
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:38,350
Thanks a lot of the Miracurall ointment.

804
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:51,600
Letter from Biswas?

805
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:54,970
He's fled, hasn't he?

806
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:00,680
Yes, he has fled
with that Bloomgarten fellow.

807
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,180
I know that he did it for the money.

808
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:04,220
He's also said that

809
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:09,140
he's going to meet up with us
after dropping the foreigners at El Dorado.

810
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:10,970
Amazing!

811
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:14,390
Does the man have no self-respect whatsoever?

812
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:20,010
He dares to show his face amongst our company
even after doing something so base.

813
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,970
Damn it! It's all my fault.

814
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:26,180
I'm the one who insisted you
to bring him along with us.

815
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,800
Dr. Shanku!

816
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,220
We're all set.

817
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:38,760
Anyway, don't let this bother you too much.

818
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:46,180
But from now on, we must stay away from anything
that's paranormal, unnatural and spiritual.

819
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:48,890
For our own good.

820
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:54,720
Lobo!

821
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:57,850
- Hello!
- Hello!

822
01:02:57,970 --> 01:02:59,430
- Hyter.
- Hello.

823
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:01,470
- Hyter.
- Saunders.

824
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:04,800
- Hyter. Nice to meet you. Kroll
- Kroll.

825
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:08,510
Our plane is parked out
in another small airport.

826
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:09,180
Right.

827
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:11,010
It's a 10-minute drive from here.

828
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:12,890
- Come on.
- Okay.

829
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:17,050
How was Sao Paulo?

830
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:18,180
Very nice.

831
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:22,300
We'll discuss the plans for the upcoming days
aboard the plane.

832
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,680
If you want to see anything in particular
now is the time to tell me.

833
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:30,640
Okay but what's your opinion
about El Dorado?

834
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,600
Wow!

835
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:38,100
In today's modern world,
you're still asking me about El Dorado.

836
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:41,260
The place has been proven a myth
years ago.

837
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,260
El Dorado isn't even a city.

838
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,890
It is actually a person.

839
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:53,100
The word "Dorado" can refer to both golden city
or golden person in Portuguese.

840
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:54,510
Exactly!

841
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:59,470
The tribal folks started worshipping
a certain individual...

842
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:02,800
believing him to be the avatar of the Sun God.

843
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,720
And giving him the name El Dorado.

844
01:04:19,970 --> 01:04:24,640
Our present destination is the city
of Posto Diauarum.

845
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:29,640
From there we'll take a launch
down the Xingu river until we reach Porori.

846
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,350
- Porori...
- Porori.

847
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:36,470
At Porori, we'll meet the last members
of the Txukahameis tribe.

848
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:37,930
- Right.
- Oh really!

849
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:42,100
Who until recently had lived
in their own traditional style.

850
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:44,600
It's a fascinating tribe!
Fascinating!

851
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,300
I know their language.
So communication is easy.

852
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,140
Yeah.

853
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,640
After leaving Porori...

854
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:55,550
we'll travel a short distance downriver
and see von Martius Falls.

855
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:58,720
After which we'll return to Brasilia.

856
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,510
Oh jolly good!

857
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:34,550
Look to your right!

858
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,220
That the carcass of a cayman alligator.

859
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:47,550
No matter what you do,
don't put your hands in the water.

860
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:51,760
This river is rife with voracious piranhas.

861
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:15,010
What was that?

862
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:18,140
There's a highway under construction nearby.

863
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:20,640
They are cutting sections of the forest.

864
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,430
And using dynamite
to break apart the mountains.

865
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:41,550
How much further?

866
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:43,720
Soon... Soon...

867
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,300
El Dorado!

868
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:08,390
My beautiful El Dorado!
It's breathtaking!

869
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,100
Joe, land this thing.

870
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:14,260
I can't land in such dense overgrowth.

871
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:16,640
Just find a clearing somewhere.

872
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:36,470
We should reach the Porori village
by dawn tomorrow.

873
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,430
Good.

874
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:39,760
I know we're quite deep inside the forest...

875
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,430
but we haven't seen one thing yet.

876
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:44,050
And what's that?

877
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:46,550
Anaconda.

878
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:50,550
It's best we don't run across one of those.

879
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:52,390
Quite dangerous creatures.

880
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:54,510
Have you ever seen one of them?

881
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:56,260
Yes, twice.

882
01:07:56,430 --> 01:07:58,430
We've seen them too.

883
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:01,010
Well, at the zoo.

884
01:08:03,350 --> 01:08:04,680
Excuse me.

885
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,800
I've read some traveller's articles...

886
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:13,970
that say this kind of snake
can grow upto 50 metres maybe.

887
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:15,850
Come on, Wil.

888
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:19,720
Anyway, I have no regrets
that I haven't seen one of those.

889
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:26,680
But you'd have to agree what we've seen
of Brazil's rainforest is just simply--

890
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:33,350
It's a jaguar...

891
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:06,550
What's that?

892
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:09,510
I'll tell you later.
But first Lobo...

893
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:18,930
It's alright, Lobo.
The danger's gone.

894
01:09:18,970 --> 01:09:21,550
You're safe now.
You're safe.

895
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:25,600
I went behind the bushes to relieve myself.

896
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:30,640
I saw in front of me...

897
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:38,760
What happened?

898
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,510
Forgive me, professor.

899
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,600
Forgive me, professor.
I've wronged you.

900
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,930
How have you wronged me?

901
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:49,600
I night before the presentation, I...

902
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,140
I bribed the security guards and...

903
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:54,140
And entered the exhibition hall.

904
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:58,050
And scanned my research papers...
Gave them to Solomon.

905
01:09:58,050 --> 01:09:59,180
Is that right?

906
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:01,640
He offered me money, professor.

907
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:04,100
A huge sum of money.

908
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:06,600
What's going to happen to me now?

909
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,640
Okay.

910
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:11,100
- Once I get back to the city...
- We can think about that later.

911
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,970
We can think about that later.
For now, just rest.

912
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:15,220
Just rest.

913
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:16,390
Please forgive me.

914
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:17,760
Yes.

915
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:19,180
Go to sleep.

916
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:21,180
(praying)

917
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:23,180
Go to sleep.

918
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:25,140
Yes.

919
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:33,930
But how did you even know about this?

920
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:36,510
Oh, you know, my secretary.

921
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:42,470
And even after knowing about this,
you didn't think of telling us.

922
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:44,430
Damn it, Shanku!

923
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:47,890
What would be the point?
There's no proof.

924
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:50,720
Because your loss is incalculable.

925
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:53,800
You're going to be ruined.

926
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:58,850
If I could just get my hands on Solomon,
right now.

927
01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:03,510
I would boil him and invite
local cannibal tribes to feast on him.

928
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:12,510
But if Mr. Biswas knew about Lobo's treachery
does that mean that El Dorado is also...

929
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:27,720
That wasn't dynamite.

930
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:31,600
Is there a volcano nearby?

931
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,680
- Coffee.
- Thank you.

932
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,930
It smells good.

933
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,140
Coffee?

934
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,850
Thanks.

935
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:07,260
Porori is just a mile and a half.

936
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:55,680
Jeremy, the wheel!

937
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:08,390
The arrow was dipped in curare poison.

938
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:18,220
Curare poison.

939
01:13:18,220 --> 01:13:20,300
Just keep calm.

940
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:25,800
Should I take the next bend?

941
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:28,140
Yes, yes.

942
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:32,850
Hyter?

943
01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:49,220
It seems we're out of danger for now.
Don't you think?

944
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:50,510
Yes.

945
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:56,010
He's got a pulse
but it's very faint.

946
01:13:56,010 --> 01:13:59,970
Curare is a very potent poison.
It'll take him some time to...

947
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:04,760
In that case, let's get some distance
between us and the tribals.

948
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,680
And stop the boat.

949
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:10,760
There's no point in going
forward without Hyter.

950
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:35,550
Professor...

951
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:40,640
Did you have any idea
that you're travelling with...

952
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:45,260
one of the world's most celebrated
and genius inventors?

953
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:48,050
I suspected something like that yesterday.

954
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,510
And today...

955
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:50,640
But tell me...

956
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,180
What could have caused the Txukahameis tribe
to be so riled up?

957
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:58,600
I think this might be related to the explosion
we heard last evening.

958
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:03,100
They still believe these large scale
natural disasters to be acts of God...

959
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:05,470
showing his divine displeasure.

960
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:07,550
And they start panicking.

961
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:26,850
Shanku! Shanku!

962
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:44,640
That's not going to work, Tilu.

963
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:54,050
Hey, are you happy now?

964
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:56,600
This is incredible!

965
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:00,260
Thank you.

966
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:06,970
Tell me, Tilu.
Has my ability improved?

967
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:11,800
Did you find the image blurry or unclear?

968
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:14,720
Close to real life, isn't it?

969
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:17,640
All thanks to you.

970
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,720
I wouldn't be able to do it
if it wasn't for you.

971
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:21,850
What do you mean?

972
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:23,260
Your medicine.

973
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,680
All thanks to Cerebrillant!

974
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:34,430
Your pill has made be doubly capable.

975
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:36,680
- Really?
- Yes.

976
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:40,600
Let me introduce you.
Joe, come.

977
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:43,680
This is pilot, Joe Hopgood.

978
01:16:44,010 --> 01:16:47,010
He brought me here in Solomon's plane.

979
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:50,760
We had to use the small boat
for the last few miles.

980
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:53,470
Nice to meet you Mr. Hopgood.

981
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,970
And El Dorado?

982
01:16:55,970 --> 01:16:58,510
I made him see it from the plane.

983
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:03,260
The way I showed you the snake.
Exactly like that.

984
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:06,760
Wait. Here.

985
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:07,800
SOUTH AMERICAN EXPEDITION
BRAZIL

986
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,510
This is the book on Brazil.

987
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:13,300
Look at this.

988
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:17,050
This is the photo of the snake.

989
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:19,390
And see this.

990
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,600
This is a fictional drawing of El Dorado.

991
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,800
Where will I find a photo?

992
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:30,180
This looks very amateurish.

993
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:34,100
Of course, it is.

994
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,680
And this is what you showed Solomon?

995
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:40,050
He was elated!

996
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:41,260
Then what happened?

997
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:46,720
First let me tell you what happened
on the last day of the conference.

998
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:48,220
Last day?
What happened?

999
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:49,550
You already know.

1000
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,890
Whatever is going to happen...

1001
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:53,640
if we already know about it...

1002
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,220
it can be of a great advantage.

1003
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,470
That's what happened to me too.

1004
01:17:58,550 --> 01:18:00,220
To Dr. Shanku!

1005
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:02,760
Doctor Shanku!

1006
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:23,510
(singing in foreign language)

1007
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:44,390
Just say we actually end up finding El Dorado
with Bis' help. What then?

1008
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:47,010
I'll make him my ace in the hole.

1009
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:49,640
And take him back to the United States.

1010
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:55,050
Not exploiting his remarkable talents
would be a huge mistake.

1011
01:18:55,930 --> 01:18:59,010
But I don't trust our pilot, Joe.

1012
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:01,720
Once he finds out the location of El Dorado.

1013
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:05,760
What guarantee do we have
that he's not going to backstab us?

1014
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:08,890
No, he must be taken care of.

1015
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:13,180
The credit of finding El Dorado should be mine.

1016
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:17,640
I, Solomon Bloomgarten and no one else.

1017
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:24,640
Fine, I'll handle Joe after we get back here.

1018
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,100
Make it look like an accident.
An accident.

1019
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:28,550
Absolutely!

1020
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:31,180
And what about Professor Shanku's inventions?

1021
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:34,600
We'll take care of that when we return.
We have the goods.

1022
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,050
Why worry?

1023
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:40,470
Now my priority is El Dorado.

1024
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:43,260
What a dangerous man!

1025
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:51,260
That's when I decided
I had to tell him about El Dorado!

1026
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:54,550
Otherwise, the next part of my vision
won't take place.

1027
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:58,140
Although, it didn't take much effort to find him.

1028
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:19,800
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1029
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,550
Solomon Bloomgarten.
And you are?

1030
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:25,640
I told Sol everything about himself.

1031
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:29,010
And I told him about El Dorado.

1032
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:31,640
Sol was very happy.

1033
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:34,800
The next day's plans were charted out.

1034
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,220
And you already know
what happened after that.

1035
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:41,550
I was just speaking to them.

1036
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:43,640
Hi, congratulations!

1037
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:45,800
Please, sit. Please.

1038
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:50,760
Now let me tell you what happened
after I showed him El Dorado.

1039
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:53,640
The city is hidden in dense forest.

1040
01:20:54,180 --> 01:20:56,600
How will the plane land there?

1041
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,550
We landed it.

1042
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:03,100
In a relatively empty area.

1043
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,180
Bis, I was forgetting something.

1044
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:13,850
There you are.

1045
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,100
As promised.

1046
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,800
Bis, Joe come.

1047
01:21:57,890 --> 01:21:58,680
Come.

1048
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:03,220
Come...

1049
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:04,970
We don't have time. Come...

1050
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:12,050
This was on the plane.

1051
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:14,100
In Solomon's luggage.

1052
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:17,390
All the scanned copies of the formulae is here.

1053
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,600
It's still here.

1054
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:26,470
But what will happen when Solomon finds
that El Dorado doesn't exist.

1055
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:27,850
Solomon?

1056
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:29,550
Where is Solomon?

1057
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,970
He is not there in this world anymore.

1058
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:36,260
When we entered the forest
it was 5:30 p.m.

1059
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:39,720
And when we fled them...

1060
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:41,510
it was quarter to six.

1061
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:45,100
Stop!

1062
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:47,640
Where did they go?

1063
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:52,220
Bis! Joe!

1064
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:54,930
Go find them.

1065
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,300
Maybe they've fallen behind.

1066
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:08,300
That double crossing...

1067
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:12,300
What the... Meteorite!

1068
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:13,800
Run!

1069
01:23:24,510 --> 01:23:27,470
Yesterday's explosion.

1070
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:32,720
I already knew about this incident
because of you.

1071
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:35,680
A man like you...

1072
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:38,890
I'm honoured to be in your company.

1073
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:42,260
How can I let go of your enemy so easily?

1074
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,760
- How long back to Brasilia, Joe?
- A couple of hours.

1075
01:23:57,890 --> 01:24:02,510
- Lovely weather. It must be nice to fly here.
- Yes.

1076
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:04,720
- See you on the plane.
- Alright.

1077
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:06,390
Sorry, Lobo.

1078
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:08,930
If there was room on the plane
I would have taken you.

1079
01:24:08,930 --> 01:24:11,350
- But...
- No problem.

1080
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:14,640
I'll put him on a plane to Sao Paulo
once we get back to Brasilia.

1081
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:15,350
Thank you.

1082
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:16,800
Hey, guys!

1083
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:19,100
We're ready to leave.

1084
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:24,260
But... But...
What's going to happen to me now?

1085
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:27,930
Since all my research has been recovered
safe and sound...

1086
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:33,510
I don't think we'll need
to lodge a complaint against you.

1087
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,720
I've taken many a group
on a tour of the forest before.

1088
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:40,760
But I'll never forget this trip
with you folks ever.

1089
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:44,100
And professor...
I owe you my life.

1090
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:46,180
My pleasure.

1091
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:47,680
Joe!

1092
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:50,760
I couldn't show them the falls...
(in Portuguese)

1093
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:53,140
Could you take a detour and...

1094
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:11,350
So, that's it.
It's done then.

1095
01:25:11,350 --> 01:25:14,050
We've seen everything we set out to see.

1096
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,680
Everything but one thing.

1097
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:17,180
And what's that?

1098
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:18,970
As he is already with us...

1099
01:25:19,010 --> 01:25:22,970
I wonder if we could see El Dorado
through his eyes.

1100
01:25:22,970 --> 01:25:27,220
- Bad drawing. Very bad.
- Come on. Even so...

1101
01:25:27,470 --> 01:25:31,640
Then why see El Dorado through Biswas' eyes?

1102
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:34,050
You can see it through my eyes.

1103
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:35,800
Through your eyes?

1104
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,470
What do you mean?

1105
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:41,930
Don't forget that the medicine I gave Biswas
that night was my invention.

1106
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:44,140
Cerebrillant.

1107
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:01,300
Unbelievable!
