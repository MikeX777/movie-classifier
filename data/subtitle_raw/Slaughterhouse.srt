00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:26,919
- Wow, I thought we were the only people

7
00:00:26,952 --> 00:00:27,920
that knew about this place.

8
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:30,321
- I guess not.

9
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:31,621
- Well, who is it?

10
00:00:31,655 --> 00:00:32,689
Your wife? (gasps)

11
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,657
Sorry, only kidding.

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:35,391
Sorry.

13
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:36,925
- That's Skip Thompson's jeep.

14
00:00:39,027 --> 00:00:40,094
And the Mustang belongs to Kevin Matthews.

15
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:43,796
- Oh Dave, I don't like this, let's just keep going.

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,230
I don't want those kids to see us together.

Hello, I'm talking!

Quiet for just a minute.

21
00:00:52,468 --> 00:00:53,302
- Well, what's wrong?

22
00:00:54,036 --> 00:00:55,737
- I don't hear anything.

23
00:00:56,603 --> 00:00:58,538
- Maybe they're all making out.

24
00:00:58,572 --> 00:00:59,438

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,307

Say, what are you guys doing out here anyway?

- Maybe I oughta ask you the same thing.

42
00:02:02,476 --> 00:02:03,244
- Beginning of a four day weekend, Dave.

43
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:07,179
(chuckles) Besides, we're just practicing for Liz's

44

- Dave, I think we should just go.

46
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:12,949
Officer Thomas was kind enough to take me back

83
00:03:42,903 --> 00:03:44,404

00:03:47,873 --> 00:03:48,674

- He's an obstinate old fart, always has been.

129
00:10:36,384 --> 00:10:37,719
- [Man in cardigan] He's just a little headstrong, Tom,

130
00:10:37,752 --> 00:10:39,720
that's all.

131
00:10:39,753 --> 00:10:41,654
- Harold, I've already made two offers on that property

132
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:43,155
and the son of a gun's rejected both of 'em!

133
00:10:44,155 --> 00:10:45,290
- I know, Tom, I know.

134
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:48,125
You've been very patient.

135
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:48,791
But you're not making it easy for me, either.

136
00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:51,560
Les Bacon and I have been friends 30 years.

137
00:10:53,061 --> 00:10:55,529
And I've spent a great deal of my career looking after his

138
00:10:55,563 --> 00:10:56,396
meat packing plant 'til it closed down eight years ago.

139
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,064
- (chuckles) Hey, you're forgetting

140
00:11:00,232 --> 00:11:01,566
I put in a couple years there myself.

141
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:02,600
- [Harold] I know you have, I know.

142
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:05,168
(Tom sighs)

143
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:07,236
- Well, as his friend and attorney,

144
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:10,505
I suggest you persuade him to accept my final offer

145
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,940
otherwise the county's put it up for auction

146
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,141
and he's gonna lose it all.

147
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,042
- We, will lose it all.

148
00:11:22,045 --> 00:11:24,880
(Tom sighs)

149
00:11:24,913 --> 00:11:25,714
- [Tom] Bonnie, I'm goin' over to lakeside on business.

150
00:11:26,748 --> 00:11:28,615
I'll be back about noon.

151
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:29,349
- Okay, Mr. S.

152
00:11:34,953 --> 00:11:35,720
(door opening)

153
00:11:39,155 --> 00:11:40,289

(car starting)

156
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,077
- Morning, sheriff.

157
00:12:18,513 --> 00:12:19,312
- You know you're not a bad kid, Skip,

158
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:22,214
but someday I'm gonna be scrapin' you off the highway.

159
00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:36,456
(car horn)

160
00:12:43,227 --> 00:12:44,361
- [Skip] Morning, baby!

161
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:45,462
- Hey, good lookin'.

162
00:12:45,495 --> 00:12:46,262
- [Skip] Gimme a kiss.

163
00:12:55,101 --> 00:12:56,635
- You damn punk!

164
00:13:00,805 --> 00:13:01,504
(cows mooing)

165
00:13:03,906 --> 00:13:04,807
- Oh, this whole thing rubs against my grain.

166
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:09,176
Really pisses me off makin' another proposition to this guy.

167
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:14,379
- Well, the one thing I learned in the legal profession, Tom

168
00:13:14,412 --> 00:13:16,380
is you gotta take care of number one.

169
00:13:16,413 --> 00:13:17,714
Everybody else is number two.

170
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:22,184
So let's just say, I'm helping myself,

171
00:13:22,217 --> 00:13:25,052
you and ol' Les Bacon by doin' this.

172
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:27,554
- Nah, this just ain't good business.

173
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:28,154
The last thing I need is an old fart...

174
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:31,522
oh, no offense, Harold.

175
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:34,357
(sighs)

176
00:13:34,391 --> 00:13:36,425
Well hell, you know what I mean!

177
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:38,760
It would make it a hell of a lot easier just to let

178
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:40,228
the county foreclose on the property and buy it from them

179
00:13:40,261 --> 00:13:42,563
no strings attached.

180
00:13:42,596 --> 00:13:45,531
You got a light?

181
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:46,431
- [Harold] Yeah, if you don't call me "old fart" no more.

182
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,201
- [Voiceover] It's nine o'clock and time

183
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:51,334
for the national hog report.

184
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:53,303
Good news for hog raisers,

185
00:13:53,336 --> 00:13:55,704
the price per pound hanging weight,

186
00:13:55,737 --> 00:13:57,905
has risen from five cents to a record high of 95 cents.

187
00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:01,207
A welcome relief from just one year ago when low pork

188
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,441
prices almost bankrupted many of the nation's corporations.

189
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:07,377
H.C. Hardrally, president of the

190
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:09,278
Southwest Pork Raising Association stated that,

191
00:14:09,312 --> 00:14:12,347
"It shows that the free enterprise system works,

192
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,515
"without the need for federal subsidy."

193
00:14:14,548 --> 00:14:17,083
And now, for the weather.

194
00:14:17,116 --> 00:14:19,051
A randomly approaching storm-front

195
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:20,385
promises warm showers and some magnificent light

196
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:21,552
displays tonight.

197
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:23,987
(upbeat music)

198
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,222
- [Voiceover] Hey, all you KFATsos, the KFAT jocks

200
00:14:27,923 --> 00:14:29,891

And yours truly, Captain Fogel will meet ya at the

202
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:32,526
VFW Hall for a big all-out dance!

203
00:14:33,826 --> 00:14:36,595
(crowd cheering)

204
00:14:36,628 --> 00:14:38,629
All weekend long, KFAT jocks will play music recorded

205
00:14:38,662 --> 00:14:40,930
by local groups throughout the county.

206
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,999
You can hear some of the best bash their way to glory

207
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:44,166
at the (drowned out by car horn) KFAT Pig Out!

208
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:46,868
(crowd cheering)

209
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:47,869
Doors open 7:30, no booze or you lose,

210
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:49,569
be there!

211
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:00,510
(dark ambient music)

212
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:10,249
(sign clanking)

213
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,524
- Tom.

214
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:25,424
Harold.

215
00:15:26,424 --> 00:15:27,359
- Well I guess this is it.

216
00:15:42,234 --> 00:15:43,801
(rattling)

217
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:56,009
- My God.

218
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:56,976
(rattling)

219
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,949
(flies buzzing)

220
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:16,721
So he's gettin' worse.

221
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:25,294
(door knock) Lester?

222
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:30,263
(door knock) Lester!

223
00:16:32,097 --> 00:16:33,398
(door knock) Lester.

224
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,434
(door knock)

225
00:16:38,268 --> 00:16:38,801
(man snorting)

226
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:46,839
Good morning, Lester.

227
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:47,807
- [Lester] Sheriff.

228
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,407
- Lester,

229
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:50,242
Tom Samford and I have been talkin'.

230
00:16:51,576 --> 00:16:52,610
He'd like to make you a new offer.

231
00:16:54,077 --> 00:16:54,878
- Final offer, I'll give you $55,000 for the property.

232
00:16:55,844 --> 00:16:58,247
You can stay here.

233
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,347
And...

234
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:02,649
work for me as my consultant.

235
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:03,683
- [Lester] And the slaughterhouse?

236
00:17:05,117 --> 00:17:07,686
- That's too far gone to be useful for anything but storage

237
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:08,586
and then it'll be tore down, replaced by a modern plant.

238
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,322
- Mean more than 100 new jobs to community, Lester.

239
00:17:12,355 --> 00:17:14,122
You can be part of it.

240
00:17:14,156 --> 00:17:16,857
- And it'll get the county assessor off your back.

241
00:17:16,891 --> 00:17:17,858
- [Lester] Harold, you've been my adviser for many years.

242
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:22,061
You helped me start my meat business.

243
00:17:22,094 --> 00:17:23,361
We watched it grow and we watched it die.

244
00:17:24,395 --> 00:17:26,730
- I told you to mechanize, Lester.

245
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:27,497
Mechanize, but you wouldn't listen to me.

246
00:17:28,698 --> 00:17:29,865
Me and ol' Tom Sanford saw it comin'.

247
00:17:31,866 --> 00:17:33,834
- [Lester] When it died, you were the one that advised me

248
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:34,935
to convert to citrus packin', you, Harold!

249
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:38,770
"People always drink orange juice for breakfast", you said.

250
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:41,839
"But they can't always afford a steak dinner."

251
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,374
- And it would have worked too if you had put your

252
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:45,975
heart into it.

253
00:17:46,008 --> 00:17:47,910
- Look at these!

254
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:48,610
These aren't the hands of an orange picker!

255
00:17:50,578 --> 00:17:53,213
These are the hands of a skilled butcher.

256
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:54,313
I've spent my life preparing the choices cuts of meat.

257
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:59,083
The finest sausages, and we did it all

258
00:17:59,116 --> 00:18:00,417
with the skill of craftsmen and sharp knives!

259
00:18:01,451 --> 00:18:03,685
Not sinew chewing chainsaws!

260
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:07,021
- I don't have to listen to this maniac.

261
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:09,055
- [Harold] Wait, Tom! - [Tom] No, forget it.

262
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,923
It's over, just let the county take the property.

263
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,791
- [Harold] You're being pigheaded, Lester!

264
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,293
- You young hotdogs are all alike.

265
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:17,094
You've no sense for what I could do with 20 good men,

266
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:18,294
what you have to do with 100!

267
00:18:19,028 --> 00:18:20,630
- Just hold on, Lester!

268
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:21,329
- And I'd never allow 30% fat!

269
00:18:23,198 --> 00:18:25,132
- You're an old fool, Lester.

270
00:18:25,165 --> 00:18:25,965
- 30% fat, Harold!

271
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,734
Men like him are plugging up our young people's arteries!

272
00:18:32,637 --> 00:18:35,672
- Lester, it's my duty to inform you that the

273
00:18:35,705 --> 00:18:37,006
county assessor's office hereby forecloses on your property

274
00:18:38,173 --> 00:18:41,675
to be sold at public auction.

275
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:42,776
You have 30 days to leave the premises.

276
00:18:45,111 --> 00:18:47,412
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:48,079
- No one's kickin' me off this here property.

278
00:18:49,513 --> 00:18:50,880
Not the law,

279
00:18:51,447 --> 00:18:52,348
no meat hacker,

280
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:54,016
and no conniving lawyer.

281
00:18:55,283 --> 00:18:57,218
You're all conspirators!

282
00:18:57,251 --> 00:18:58,418
Evil conspirators!

283
00:18:58,451 --> 00:18:59,552
Taxes, shit!

284
00:19:01,287 --> 00:19:03,655
I've paid my taxes for the last 30 years when I could!

285
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:05,657
I bet I paid your salary 100 times over, buddy-boy!

286
00:19:06,823 --> 00:19:10,092
And this is what I get after 30 years?

287
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:12,427
(dark ambient music)

288
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,462
- Well you have 30 days left!

289
00:19:19,097 --> 00:19:20,831
(Harold sighs)

290
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:21,766
- Well, you still got time, Lester.

291
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:24,501
Think this offer over.

292
00:19:25,235 --> 00:19:26,368
Call me at the office.

293
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,541
(man barking)

294
00:19:39,543 --> 00:19:41,377
(electro-pop music)

295
00:19:49,983 --> 00:19:51,617
- Hi, Liz.

296
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,051
- [Liz] What's up, Ronnie?

297
00:19:53,584 --> 00:19:55,852
- Not much.

298
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:57,454
Say, you guys goin' to the party tonight?

299
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,088
- Uh, yeah, I guess.

300
00:19:59,121 --> 00:20:00,089
Are we?

301
00:20:00,855 --> 00:20:01,423
- You bet!

302
00:20:02,257 --> 00:20:02,857
Are you bringing Pauline?

303
00:20:04,425 --> 00:20:06,693
- Yeah, I guess.

304
00:20:06,726 --> 00:20:07,527
- Hey, why don't you catch that window?

305
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:11,662
- This is self-service bay.

306
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:13,730
(car horn)

307
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:16,598
- Hey, where's the party?

308
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,399
- [Skip] What's up, Buzzard?

309
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:19,934
- Hey, well we just heading over to get a Coke and fries.

310
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:21,601
Y'all wanna go?

311
00:20:21,635 --> 00:20:23,169
- It's nine in the morning!

312
00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:23,936
- Hey, whatever trips your trigger, sweetheart.

313
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:25,937
- Come on, Liz, we'll meet you over there!

314
00:20:27,105 --> 00:20:28,872
- You, uh,

315
00:20:28,906 --> 00:20:30,807
you buyin'?

316
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,541
- Hell no, you're the one with the bucks!

317
00:20:36,177 --> 00:20:38,478
Oh, you broke my heart.

318
00:20:38,511 --> 00:20:39,913
We'll see you over there.

319
00:20:43,648 --> 00:20:45,882
- Should have done that a long time ago.

320
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,951
You know, this place has been nothin' but a

321
00:20:47,984 --> 00:20:49,952
hangout for bums and vagrants for years.

322
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:51,619
- You still got power to the ol' slaughterhouse.

323
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:53,887
- Yeah, I wonder if he still keeps his office up there.

324
00:21:01,158 --> 00:21:02,460
- You know, I remember when the train used to come in here

325
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:05,295
loaded with hogs.

326
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:07,596
They'd run 'em down the streets into the pens while it

327
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:09,697
loaded the processed pork on reefer cars up front.

328
00:21:09,731 --> 00:21:11,998
Yeah, it was just as if the rail roads sold each one

329
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:14,066
a round-trip ticket, in one day, out the next.

330
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,734
- Yeah, ol' Lester ran a pretty tight ship alright.

331
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,837
- What ever happened to those underground corridors?

332
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:20,937
- I don't know, I ain't been down there in years.

333
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,107
- It's just a home for spiders and critters now.

334
00:21:26,073 --> 00:21:28,908
That's for damn sure.

335
00:21:28,942 --> 00:21:30,176
Now, a holdover, from the good old days!

336
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:35,712
You know, 20 years ago,

337
00:21:35,746 --> 00:21:37,180
this whole area used to be one huge pen.

338
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:40,449
Thousands of pigs you could smell the damn things for miles.

339
00:21:41,282 --> 00:21:42,650
- You can still smell 'em.

340
00:21:43,951 --> 00:21:45,685
- I'm glad that son of a bitch fired me.

341
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:49,454
That's when I decided to go in business for myself.

342
00:21:51,255 --> 00:21:54,424
I wouldn't even be talkin' to the man if I didn't have

343
00:21:54,457 --> 00:21:57,092
this big contract coming up, I gotta have some extra space,

344
00:21:57,126 --> 00:21:58,993
and this place is perfect.

345
00:22:00,761 --> 00:22:01,595
That boy of his, he sure is an odd-lookin' son of a gun.

346
00:22:02,796 --> 00:22:03,996
What, did Bacon whip him with an ugly stick?

347
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:08,766
- No actually, Lester's always been pretty good to the boy.

348
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,633
A little light-headed, though.

349
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:12,435
- Yeah, the younger boy, what ever happened to him?

350
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:16,837
- No one seems to know for sure.

351
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:18,204
Momma died giving birth to him.

352
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,507
- [Tom] Well if he looked anything like Buddy,

353
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,674
he's probably so ugly the hog's ate him.

354
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,509
(Tom and Harold laughing)

355
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:26,076
(rock music) (car accelerates quickly)

356
00:22:31,012 --> 00:22:32,013
(police siren)

357
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:33,614
- Aw, shit!

358
00:22:38,683 --> 00:22:39,451
- I refuse to bail you out this time.

359
00:22:40,018 --> 00:22:42,420
- Damnit!

360
00:22:42,453 --> 00:22:44,554
- [Voiceover] This is KFAT radio and it's time now for

361
00:22:44,587 --> 00:22:46,121
our official weather report from our very own

362
00:22:46,155 --> 00:22:48,689
weather adviser. Here's Commander FAT!

363
00:22:48,723 --> 00:22:51,691
- [Voiceover] Hey everybody, bad news,

364
00:22:51,725 --> 00:22:53,392
there's a storm approaching from the northwest,

365
00:22:53,425 --> 00:22:55,127
it could bring lots of rain today!

366
00:22:55,161 --> 00:22:57,128
- [Voiceover] Oh, what a bummer, but hey!

367
00:22:57,162 --> 00:22:59,163
What better reason to be indoors at the VFW Hall.

368
00:22:59,196 --> 00:23:00,497
Watch some of our local bands doin' it to it,

369
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:02,832
it's the big KFAT Pig Out, you oughta check it out!

370
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,601
- Hi Dave, how ya doin'?

371
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:09,702
- When are you gonna learn, Skip?

372
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:11,403
- I wasn't doin' over 45.

373
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:13,504
- Yeah.

374
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:14,739
But this is a 25 mile an hour zone.

375
00:23:14,772 --> 00:23:17,407
What's wrong with you, boy?

376
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,474
You've already got two tickets in the last three months.

377
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:20,942
Judge Parker's gonna take away your license.

378
00:23:22,377 --> 00:23:24,711
- I am sorry about last night.

379
00:23:24,745 --> 00:23:25,845
I promise to cool it, okay?

380
00:23:26,512 --> 00:23:28,013
Not more speedin'!

381
00:23:29,214 --> 00:23:30,015
- Look, I'm not trying to hassle you kids.

382
00:23:31,348 --> 00:23:34,017
I was a kid too, once.

383
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,118
And I got my share of speeding tickets,

384
00:23:36,852 --> 00:23:37,786
but dog-gonnit, now I'm on the other side of the fence.

385
00:23:39,187 --> 00:23:41,988
I gotta wife, and a couple of little screamers,

386
00:23:42,022 --> 00:23:43,689
and I'd like to see them enjoy life in one piece.

387
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,591
And not end up splattered all over the

388
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:47,759
front end of your jeep.

389
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:49,026
- I promise, okay Dave?

390
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:52,895
(titters) Honest!

391
00:23:55,397 --> 00:23:57,198
- You're okay.

392
00:23:58,832 --> 00:24:00,266
(sighs) Damnit, stay out of trouble!

393
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,338
- Well, that was close.

394
00:24:09,371 --> 00:24:10,005
- You're lucky my dad didn't pull you over.

395
00:24:14,041 --> 00:24:15,908
(pigs snorting)

396
00:24:35,486 --> 00:24:38,121
(cat yowling)

397
00:24:41,057 --> 00:24:43,892
(Buddy growling)

398
00:24:50,263 --> 00:24:52,764
(cat yowling)

399
00:24:54,198 --> 00:24:57,200
- I can't believe you!

400
00:24:57,234 --> 00:24:58,133
9:30 in the morning and you're pigging out on french fries?

401
00:25:00,702 --> 00:25:03,437
Hey, has anybody heard from Kevin and Michelle?

402
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,905
- Not since we saw them last night.

403
00:25:05,938 --> 00:25:07,473
- I didn't see his car when I passed by his house

404
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,174
on my way to pick you up.

405
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:11,408
- He's probably helpin' set up for the party.

406
00:25:11,442 --> 00:25:12,576
- (chuckles) Knowing Michelle, she's there partying already.

407
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:15,111
- Hey, party animals, that's what we should be doing!

408
00:25:16,712 --> 00:25:17,945
How often do we get a four day holiday anyway?

409
00:25:19,146 --> 00:25:21,915
Hell, we got tomorrow to sleep it off.

410
00:25:21,948 --> 00:25:23,616
- I have a feeling you're gonna need

411
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:25,117
more than tomorrow, pal.

412
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,018
- [Buzz] Depends on how wild the party gets.

413
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:28,752
- I doubt they'll let it get too crazy.

414
00:25:28,785 --> 00:25:29,586
- Then we'll just have to move it somewhere else.

415
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,655
- Hey, what're you girls gonna make us wear

416
00:25:32,688 --> 00:25:34,856
for this video thing?

417
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,457
- I don't know, I've been trying to think of something good.

418
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,726
Something different.

419
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:40,592
- I know, why don't I strap a mattress to your back

420
00:25:41,827 --> 00:25:43,528
and we'll go naked? (Liz giggling)

421
00:25:43,561 --> 00:25:45,629
- Cool it, Buzz.

422
00:25:45,662 --> 00:25:46,630
- Why not? We might win the boobie prize!

423
00:25:46,663 --> 00:25:47,963
(all laughing)

424
00:25:47,997 --> 00:25:48,731
- Buzz, you're sick, okay?

425
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,599
Maybe we can get some masks or something.

426
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,401
- Yeah I bet Leo's got some.

427
00:25:54,434 --> 00:25:56,168
I gotta go over there to get some video cassettes.

428
00:25:56,202 --> 00:25:57,770
Let's go check it out.

429
00:25:57,803 --> 00:25:58,703
- [Annie] Sounds good to me.

430
00:25:58,737 --> 00:26:00,272
- Why not?

431
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:01,272
- Hey, I bet you're anxious.

432
00:26:01,305 --> 00:26:03,273
- For what?

433
00:26:03,306 --> 00:26:03,973
- To get a mask over that face. (laughing)

434
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:09,577
(dark ambient music) (pig snorting)

435
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:31,290
- [Lester] 30 years, buddy-boy.

436
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:33,958
30 years and now they're skinnin' our hides.

437
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,460
(Buddy snorts)

438
00:26:38,494 --> 00:26:39,628
What's the matter with you, boy?

439
00:26:40,895 --> 00:26:42,130
Have you been up to some kind of prank?

440
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,166
(Buddy snorting)

441
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,804
My God, boy!

442
00:26:55,837 --> 00:26:56,672
What have you done?

443
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:05,877
Why? Why?

444
00:27:06,511 --> 00:27:07,178
(Buddy snorts)

445
00:27:08,345 --> 00:27:10,413
You mean they were messin' with your pigs?

446
00:27:10,446 --> 00:27:12,114
Jesus Christ, boy, you can't just slaughter people

447
00:27:12,148 --> 00:27:13,281
'cause they messed with your hogs!

448
00:27:15,382 --> 00:27:16,917
Well now we're in a heap of trouble.

449
00:27:17,785 --> 00:27:18,685
Oh, shit!

450
00:27:19,852 --> 00:27:21,119
I buy you new cleaver for your birthday,

451
00:27:21,153 --> 00:27:22,220
and this is how you repay me?

452
00:27:25,355 --> 00:27:27,157
Sometimes you really piss me off.

453
00:27:30,592 --> 00:27:32,360
At least you made good clean cuts.

454
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,928
Listen boy, these people aren't to be feared.

455
00:27:35,962 --> 00:27:38,530
They are harmless.

456
00:27:38,563 --> 00:27:39,698
There are other heads I rather see rolled than these kids.

457
00:27:40,898 --> 00:27:43,866
Murdock, Sanford and the sheriff.

458
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,634
Those sons of bitches who were schemin'

459
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:47,102
to take our property!

460
00:27:47,135 --> 00:27:48,602
They're the ones that deserve this!

461
00:27:48,636 --> 00:27:49,804
(Buddy snorting repeatedly)

462
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:52,905
(upbeat rock music)

463
00:28:24,057 --> 00:28:26,559
- [Buzz] Beware, of the fiend!

464
00:28:26,592 --> 00:28:28,426
The sex fiend!

465
00:28:29,828 --> 00:28:30,995
- Oh, come here, handsome.

466
00:28:32,162 --> 00:28:33,162
Where have you been all my life?

467
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:35,998
(Buzz panting and moaning)

468
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:49,172
- [Skip] Hey, how about these?

469
00:28:49,206 --> 00:28:50,207
- Uh, try these.

470
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,778
- [Both] Radical!

471
00:29:04,949 --> 00:29:05,882
- [Skip] Where to?

472
00:29:07,183 --> 00:29:09,084
- [Liz] I don't know, I'm open for suggestions!

473
00:29:09,118 --> 00:29:10,985
I just need something really creepy looking.

474
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:11,986
Something I can build a story around.

475
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,221
- [Buzz] How about the old lumber yard

476
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:15,654
outside of town?

477
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:17,289
- It's pretty much burned out.

478
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:19,257
- How about old lady govlin's house?

479
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,125
That always makes me shiver when I see it.

480
00:29:21,158 --> 00:29:23,226
- Well sure, like we're gonna go up to the old lady

481
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:24,560
and ask if we can use her house for a horror film.

482
00:29:24,594 --> 00:29:26,294
(Skip chuckles)

483
00:29:26,328 --> 00:29:27,828
How about the old pond?

484
00:29:27,862 --> 00:29:29,530
There's tons of crap to shoot around there.

485
00:29:29,563 --> 00:29:31,531
- Yeah, he likes to feel at home.

486
00:29:31,564 --> 00:29:33,399
- Hey, why don't we check out the old slaughterhouse?

487
00:29:33,432 --> 00:29:35,199
- That's all boarded up now, isn't it?

488
00:29:35,233 --> 00:29:36,501
Dad said they were gonna tear it down.

489
00:29:36,534 --> 00:29:37,402
- It's worth a look.

490
00:29:37,435 --> 00:29:39,202
- Okay.

491
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:39,836
- [Liz] Let's go! - [Skip] Let's do it.

492
00:29:45,606 --> 00:29:46,774
- Eight to one, good.

493
00:29:48,174 --> 00:29:49,442
Yeah, good ahead and put 20 on the notice for me.

494
00:29:51,443 --> 00:29:53,978
Right.

495
00:29:54,011 --> 00:29:56,513
Well, she better.

496
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:58,213
Alright, goodbye.

497
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:00,248
(phone ringing)

498
00:30:01,315 --> 00:30:02,783
Yello, this is Murdock.

499
00:30:04,851 --> 00:30:06,619
Les, I was just sitting here reviewing the legal documents

500
00:30:06,652 --> 00:30:07,420
on your place.

501
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:10,421
- [Lester] Good, Harold.

502
00:30:10,454 --> 00:30:11,789
Now listen, I wanna apologize for my behavior this morning.

503
00:30:12,356 --> 00:30:15,157
I was upset.

504
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,225
- [Harold] I know things haven't been easy for you, Les.

505
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:18,426
- These are troubled times, Harold.

506
00:30:19,493 --> 00:30:21,494
- Yes, but you know I got your

507
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,195
best interests at heart, Lester.

508
00:30:23,228 --> 00:30:23,862
You know we've been friends a long time.

509
00:30:24,763 --> 00:30:26,431
- A long time, Harold.

510
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:29,099
I've been thinkin' about the offer.

511
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:31,867
I've decided to work it out with Sanford,

512
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:34,002
if you're willin' to help.

513
00:30:34,035 --> 00:30:35,669
- [Harold] Sure Les, fire away.

514
00:30:35,702 --> 00:30:36,904
- Thanks, Harold.

515
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:41,173
There's a few points I'd like to discuss with ya

516
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,307
before I make a deal with Sanford.

517
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,341
- [Harold] Sure, Les.

518
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:46,810
- I was hoping you could come out here.

519
00:30:46,843 --> 00:30:48,043
I'd feel more comfortable!

520
00:30:50,144 --> 00:30:52,380
- You know, let me check my schedule.

521
00:30:52,413 --> 00:30:54,081
What time?

522
00:30:54,981 --> 00:30:57,016
- [Lester] As soon as possible.

523
00:30:57,049 --> 00:30:58,149
- Alright, I'll be there around 1:30.

524
00:30:59,451 --> 00:31:02,252
- I knew I could depend on you, Harold.

525
00:31:02,286 --> 00:31:03,319
- Yes, you can always count on me, Les.

526
00:31:12,691 --> 00:31:14,960
Hi, it's Harold Murdock.

527
00:31:14,993 --> 00:31:16,694
I'm out with a client this afternoon,

528
00:31:16,727 --> 00:31:18,495
I'll be back around three o'clock.

529
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,396
Please leave your name and number at the beep.

530
00:31:21,297 --> 00:31:23,465
(electronic music) - [Voiceover] K-F-A-T, KFAT Radio

531
00:31:23,498 --> 00:31:25,699
weather forecast not lookin' too good, there's a chance

532
00:31:25,732 --> 00:31:28,101
of showers on the way, in fact a big storm is comin'.

533
00:31:28,134 --> 00:31:29,302
So get those umbrellas out and come to out KFAT Pig Out!

534
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,441
- It looks empty.

535
00:31:39,475 --> 00:31:40,508
- [Liz] It looks creepy.

536
00:31:44,244 --> 00:31:45,344
- [Voiceover] 153, this is central.

537
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:50,114
- 153. Go ahead, central.

538
00:31:51,548 --> 00:31:53,416
- There's been a bad accident about 15 miles out

539
00:31:53,449 --> 00:31:56,218
on highway 13.

540
00:31:56,251 --> 00:31:58,385
Sheriff Borden's on his way out there now and he

541
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:00,820
wants you to take over until further notice.

542
00:32:00,854 --> 00:32:03,222
- Are you sure he doesn't need any help?

543
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,189
- Not at this point, just keep an eye on things.

544
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,225
Be advised that Eleanor Mitchell called.

545
00:32:08,725 --> 00:32:10,493
Michelle was out last night with Kevin Matthews.

546
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:13,461
And Kevin's parents haven't seen him either.

547
00:32:16,163 --> 00:32:17,498
Dave!

548
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:20,832
- Jan, I'm gonna check somethin' out.

549
00:32:20,866 --> 00:32:21,900
Notify me immediately if we get an update on them, okay?

550
00:32:24,034 --> 00:32:26,836

551
00:33:27,173 --> 00:33:28,573

00:33:40,647 --> 00:33:42,448

554
00:34:16,268 --> 00:34:18,503
(door creaking) (upbeat music)

555
00:34:21,538 --> 00:34:23,606

- I've been acting like an old fool, Tom.

584
00:36:38,186 --> 00:36:40,621
I'm ready to make a deal.

585
00:36:40,655 --> 00:36:43,023
Harold's on his way.

586
00:36:43,056 --> 00:36:44,157
I know you're a busy man.

587
00:36:45,357 --> 00:36:46,592
Just come on up and we'll get it over with.

588
00:36:48,226 --> 00:36:50,360
Oh, what I said about 30% fat?

589
00:36:51,395 --> 00:36:53,396
I understand profit margin.

590
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,431
Okay, I'll see you about five.

591
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:01,601
(pigs squealing)

592
00:37:26,182 --> 00:37:28,116
- How'd it go?

593
00:37:28,684 --> 00:37:30,618
- Bad, real bad.

594
00:37:30,651 --> 00:37:31,252
I'll let you in on the details later.

595
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:34,454
My stomach's upset, it must have been something I ate.

596
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,689
- [Jan] Or that accident, maybe?

597
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,324
Nerves, that's what it is, nerves!

598
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:41,391
- Have you heard from Dave?

599
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,192
- [Jan] About a half hour ago.

600
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:45,293
I'll give him a call and let him know you're back.

601
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:46,227
- Hold on a minute, I'd like to talk to him.

602
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,531
(dark atmospheric music)

603
00:37:53,465 --> 00:37:54,566
- [Dave] Kevin!

604
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:56,200
Michelle!

605
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,113

611
00:39:55,972 --> 00:39:56,572
(squealing behind door)

00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:47,602
(Dave panting and groaning)

616
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:59,210
- Psh!

617
00:40:59,876 --> 00:41:00,410
(Buddy snorting)

618
00:41:03,979 --> 00:41:06,714
(Dave panting)

619
00:41:15,252 --> 00:41:18,455
(thud)

620
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:21,824
- [Jan] Central, car 153.

621
00:41:25,258 --> 00:41:27,927
Central to car 153, Dave!

622
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,627
Do you read me?

623
00:41:30,128 --> 00:41:32,296
Dave.

624
00:41:32,996 --> 00:41:33,597
Central clear.

625
00:41:43,937 --> 00:41:44,870
- My God!

626
00:41:46,705 --> 00:41:47,872
You've gone hog wild! (Buddy snorting excitedly)

627
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,475
I told you son,

628
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:53,209
Murdock, Sanford and the sheriff.

629
00:41:54,477 --> 00:41:56,478
They're our enemies, not these people!

630
00:42:01,314 --> 00:42:03,048
He's not the sheriff!

631
00:42:03,081 --> 00:42:04,182
Just the deputy.

632
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:08,685
It's okay, son, I know.

633
00:42:08,718 --> 00:42:10,853
Clean up this mess and put him with the others

634
00:42:10,886 --> 00:42:12,286
before Murdock gets here.

635
00:42:13,421 --> 00:42:14,555
And maybe we can make good use of 'em.

636
00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:22,893
(Buddy yowls)

637
00:42:52,377 --> 00:42:53,845
I'm glad you could come, Harold.

638
00:42:53,879 --> 00:42:55,346
- No problem, Lester.

639
00:42:55,379 --> 00:42:56,280
- Bring back memories?

640
00:42:57,514 --> 00:42:58,515
- Yeah, I haven't been in this room in years!

641
00:42:59,648 --> 00:43:01,917
Since we put the padlock on the door.

642
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:03,784
- Eight years ago, Harold.

643
00:43:03,818 --> 00:43:04,618
- Eight years. Boy times flies, doesn't it?

644
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:07,653
- For some people.

645
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,390
- You know, maybe your arrangement with Sanford

646
00:43:13,423 --> 00:43:14,590
will be a new beginning for you, Lester.

647
00:43:15,858 --> 00:43:17,526
Where is Tom anyway?

648
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:18,827
I didn't see his car out there.

649
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,294
- He's waiting for you.

650
00:43:20,594 --> 00:43:21,462
- And I didn't know sheriff Borden was coming over.

651
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,397
- [Lester] He's in here.

652
00:43:31,701 --> 00:43:33,502
- What the hell is this, Lester, some kind of Prank?

653
00:43:33,536 --> 00:43:35,470
- [Lester] No, just deceit, Harold.

654
00:43:35,503 --> 00:43:37,170
Something you understand all too well.

655
00:43:37,204 --> 00:43:39,139
- Wait just a minute, Lester.

656
00:43:39,172 --> 00:43:40,239
- [Lester] I have been waiting eight long years, Harold.

657
00:43:41,774 --> 00:43:44,376
Eight years you've been conspiring with others

658
00:43:44,409 --> 00:43:45,309
to steal all that I've worked and planned for.

659
00:43:47,076 --> 00:43:49,611
And you've managed to do it all through one of the most

660
00:43:49,645 --> 00:43:51,246
conniving methods known to civilized man.

661
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,548
Taxes!

662
00:43:54,814 --> 00:43:56,016
- You know, Borden and Sanford are right.

663
00:43:56,049 --> 00:43:57,917
You are crazy.

664
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:58,851
Let me out of here, Lester.

665
00:43:58,884 --> 00:44:00,318
(thud)

666
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:00,952
- I have something to show you.

667
00:44:02,286 --> 00:44:03,787
(haunting ambient music)

668
00:44:09,057 --> 00:44:10,925
- Oh my God, man.

669
00:44:10,958 --> 00:44:11,959
- God had nothing to do with this, Harold.

670
00:44:17,228 --> 00:44:18,229
(swooshing)

671
00:44:18,262 --> 00:44:19,330
(snorting)

672
00:44:20,363 --> 00:44:21,331
I see you've met the bailiff.

673
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:26,501
Better not move, Harold!

674
00:44:26,534 --> 00:44:28,368
Remember Buddy can split the head off a chicken

675
00:44:28,402 --> 00:44:30,336
on the run at 20 feet.

676
00:44:33,605 --> 00:44:35,406
Not exactly a jury of your peers,

677
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,541
but then Buddy has never been very discriminating.

678
00:44:39,775 --> 00:44:41,743
- Listen to me Lester, it's not too late!

679
00:44:42,443 --> 00:44:44,011
I can still help ya!

680
00:44:44,045 --> 00:44:45,478
- Help me?

681
00:44:45,512 --> 00:44:45,979
I'm not the one on trial here.

682
00:44:49,381 --> 00:44:51,382
- I can help you cover things up!

683
00:44:52,149 --> 00:44:54,284
- Deception!

684
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:55,885
Do you see what I mean, Harold?

685
00:44:55,918 --> 00:44:56,552
You've been deceiving people for years!

686
00:44:58,453 --> 00:44:59,787
- I haven't screwed you in 30 years, Lester.

687
00:45:01,088 --> 00:45:02,655
- Why don't we ask the jury what they think?

688
00:45:04,424 --> 00:45:05,524
- Damnit, Lester, let me out of here!

689
00:45:06,825 --> 00:45:07,925
- Honorable men and woman of the jury,

690
00:45:09,526 --> 00:45:11,428
you've heard Mr. Murdock's story.

691
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:15,196
If you believe this man to be lying,

692
00:45:15,229 --> 00:45:16,664
please signify by raising a hand.

693
00:45:21,867 --> 00:45:24,302
I guess there's only one dissenting vote, Harold.

694
00:45:25,569 --> 00:45:27,503
- God damnit, Lester, let me out of here.

695
00:45:27,537 --> 00:45:28,471
- Say your prayers, Harold.

696
00:45:30,072 --> 00:45:33,040
You won't feel a thing.

697
00:45:33,074 --> 00:45:35,008
We do things kosher.

698
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:35,775
(Buddy growling)

699
00:45:36,343 --> 00:45:36,876
(Lester cackles)

700
00:45:39,444 --> 00:45:41,746
(Harold groaning)

701
00:45:45,681 --> 00:45:48,550
(gurgling) (Lester cackling)

702
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:59,522
(blood dripping)

703
00:46:11,097 --> 00:46:12,797
- [Liz] (laughing) You hot dog.

704
00:46:12,831 --> 00:46:13,999
- [Skip] Yeah, that's what they all say.

705
00:46:14,032 --> 00:46:15,833
- [Liz] You wish.

706
00:46:15,866 --> 00:46:16,966
Think you're pretty hot stuff, don't ya?

707
00:46:18,635 --> 00:46:20,035
- [Skip] Yeah. - [Liz] Yeah.

708
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,403
Come here.

709
00:46:21,436 --> 00:46:22,503
- [Skip] What?

710
00:46:22,536 --> 00:46:23,037
- I'm pretty lucky.

711
00:46:24,971 --> 00:46:26,139
- About what?

712
00:46:26,172 --> 00:46:27,640
- About you!

713
00:46:27,673 --> 00:46:28,607
You always treat me so good.

714
00:46:29,308 --> 00:46:30,642
You're always so gentle.

715
00:46:30,675 --> 00:46:31,676
Unlike Kevin or Buzz.

716
00:46:33,944 --> 00:46:35,378
- Hey, those are great guys, you know?

717
00:46:35,411 --> 00:46:37,412
It's...

718
00:46:37,445 --> 00:46:38,680
it's just everyone's different.

719
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,181
- Yeah, well Kevin attacks every girl he's with.

720
00:46:42,215 --> 00:46:43,549
- Well that's Kevin's style.

721
00:46:44,383 --> 00:46:45,684
- [Liz] Well I like yours.

722
00:46:58,025 --> 00:46:59,492
(dark ambient music) (flies buzzing)

723
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:14,567
(Buddy grunts)

724
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,441
(Buddy snorts)

725
00:47:35,914 --> 00:47:38,482
- I got two kids missing, one deputy on vacation,

726
00:47:38,516 --> 00:47:40,483
one I can't find and a town full of kids

727
00:47:40,517 --> 00:47:41,950
loaded for a bear tonight.

728
00:47:43,118 --> 00:47:45,720
Jan, I'm gonna check around

729
00:47:45,753 --> 00:47:48,021
and see if I can come up with something on Dave.

730
00:47:48,055 --> 00:47:48,955
- Why don't you try the Lakeside Hotel?

731
00:47:50,089 --> 00:47:50,790
He's been stopping there for lunch lately.

732
00:47:51,923 --> 00:47:53,591
- Oh, really?

733
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:54,725
How long's this been goin' on?

734
00:47:54,758 --> 00:47:55,959
- Last couple months.

735
00:47:58,127 --> 00:47:59,928
- Hm.

736
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:01,163
Keep in touch.

737
00:48:01,196 --> 00:48:02,463
- Sheriff!

738
00:48:03,364 --> 00:48:04,564
Don't tell him I told ya, huh?

739
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:05,565
(Borden clicks tongue)

740
00:48:15,738 --> 00:48:16,706
(mellow rock and roll music)

741
00:48:27,945 --> 00:48:29,479
- Jerry Blatchet told me that last storm destroyed about

742
00:48:29,512 --> 00:48:32,314
20% of his crop.

743
00:48:32,347 --> 00:48:33,048
Lord knows what this one's gonna do.

744
00:48:34,749 --> 00:48:35,917
What's up, sheriff?

745
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:36,718
- Herb, Ernie.

746
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:40,786
You haven't seen my Deputy, Dave, today have you?

747
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,387
- No, but he's been comin' in here for lunch lately.

748
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,722
Didn't show today, though.

749
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,623
- Well he's been missing since this morning

750
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:46,989
and he doesn't answer his car radio.

751
00:48:48,591 --> 00:48:50,025
So can you help me out here?

752
00:48:51,626 --> 00:48:52,893
- Ernie, you seen Dave Thomas today?

753
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:55,762
(Ernie mumbles)

754
00:48:55,795 --> 00:48:56,629
Anybody here seen Dave Thomas today?

755
00:48:58,831 --> 00:49:00,565
- I saw him this morning, sheriff.

756
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,904
- You are?

757
00:49:10,938 --> 00:49:11,638
- Sally Jean Duncan, I work over at the cafe.

758
00:49:17,808 --> 00:49:19,176
- Miss Duncan, when was the last time you saw Deputy Thomas?

759
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:23,779
- This morning.

760
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:26,414

767

00:53:41,799 --> 00:53:43,268
- Mm, no. It's okay, I'll take over.

809
00:53:43,301 --> 00:53:44,034
Go get ready for the party. - [Liz] Thanks.

810
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:49,037
Mm, instant cardboard. (Mrs. Borden laughs)

811
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:50,372
I'll be upstairs if you need me.

812
00:53:50,405 --> 00:53:51,839
Hi, pa.

813
00:53:51,872 --> 00:53:52,806
- Honey, you're home early.

814
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:53,340
Have an easy day?

815
00:53:54,641 --> 00:53:55,775
- Hardly.

816
00:53:56,675 --> 00:53:57,843
Oh, my favorite!

817
00:54:00,211 --> 00:54:01,912
Now sweetheart, I won't be home for dinner tonight.

818
00:54:02,979 --> 00:54:06,015
Vern's on vacation, Dave's missing,

819
00:54:06,048 --> 00:54:08,049
and Jan's minding the store.

820
00:54:08,082 --> 00:54:08,816
- I know, what is this about Dave missing?

821
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:12,785
- I don't know, nobody's seen him since this morning.

822
00:54:12,818 --> 00:54:14,886
- You know, I talked to Kevin Matthew's mother today.

823
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,087
She hasn't seen him since last night.

824
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:19,422
(sighs) She's petrified.

825
00:54:19,455 --> 00:54:20,790
You know, I think I'm gonna go over there tonight.

826
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:24,292
- I put out an APB in the other counties

827
00:54:24,325 --> 00:54:25,092
for Kevin and the Mitchell girl.

828
00:54:26,493 --> 00:54:28,028
- I hope it's nothing serious.

829
00:54:28,061 --> 00:54:29,561
- Hopefully they just eloped.

830
00:54:29,595 --> 00:54:30,829
(door knocking)

831
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:32,797
- [Liz] I'll get it!

832
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:33,264
- Oh, that's Skip!

833
00:54:34,398 --> 00:54:35,499
They're going to the KFAT dance.

834
00:54:35,532 --> 00:54:36,933
- The whole town is.

835
00:54:39,534 --> 00:54:41,202
- Hi, Skip.

836
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:41,702
- Hi, Mrs. Borden.

837
00:54:42,269 --> 00:54:43,604
Hi, sheriff.

838
00:54:44,203 --> 00:54:44,804
- Hi, Skip.

839
00:54:46,439 --> 00:54:48,273
- Any word on Kevin?

840
00:54:48,307 --> 00:54:50,541
- Nothin' yet.

841
00:54:50,575 --> 00:54:51,042
Now, you two take it easy tonight.

842
00:54:51,908 --> 00:54:52,275
I don't want any shenanigans.

843
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,110
- [Liz] We'll be good.

844
00:54:55,144 --> 00:54:57,011
Bye, pa.

845
00:54:57,045 --> 00:54:57,712
- Honey, I'll bring dinner by the office.

846
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:00,213
- [Sheriff] Thanks a lot!

847
00:55:03,482 --> 00:55:04,349
- You know, your dad's really concerned about Dave missing.

848
00:55:05,784 --> 00:55:07,685
- He's probably out with that Sally Jean!

849
00:55:07,718 --> 00:55:09,652
- That's not nice.

850
00:55:10,486 --> 00:55:11,187
- Well maybe it's true!

851
00:55:15,523 --> 00:55:16,390
You know, you oughta say somethin' to him about that.

852
00:55:35,535 --> 00:55:37,035
(dark atmospheric music)

853
00:56:00,183 --> 00:56:03,652
(door creaking)

854
00:56:25,331 --> 00:56:27,899
(clanging)

855
00:56:36,404 --> 00:56:37,839
- Harold!

856
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:57,584
- It's still an effective method of getting

857
00:56:57,617 --> 00:56:59,151
rid of waste.

858
00:56:59,184 --> 00:57:01,220
Remember when we processed maybe,

859
00:57:01,253 --> 00:57:02,286
fifty, sixty thousand head a year?

860
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:05,756
Not bad for human muscle and sharp knives.

861
00:57:07,723 --> 00:57:09,891
- Yeah well, it's a museum piece now!

862
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:13,460
Where's Murdock? I saw his car out front.

863
00:57:13,494 --> 00:57:14,394
- He's down in the coolers.

864
00:57:15,828 --> 00:57:17,662
You remember Buddy?

865
00:57:17,696 --> 00:57:18,730
Buddy's a good boy.

866
00:57:20,164 --> 00:57:21,032
But he has what you might call, basic hygiene problems.

867
00:57:22,832 --> 00:57:24,466
- Well let's, uh, get down to business.

868
00:57:25,501 --> 00:57:28,369
Where's Murdock?

869
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:29,002
- Well let's just say he's, indisposed.

870
00:57:35,173 --> 00:57:37,708
- What the hell's goin' on here?

871
00:57:37,741 --> 00:57:39,842
Don't play with me, Bacon!

872
00:57:41,376 --> 00:57:42,778
Let me go, fat boy!

873
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:45,946
(Lester laughing)

874
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:47,047
This isn't funny, Bacon.

875
00:57:48,782 --> 00:57:50,883
(Lester chuckling)

876
00:57:53,484 --> 00:57:55,519
(machine humming)

877
00:57:55,552 --> 00:57:57,453
Are you crazy?

878
00:57:59,187 --> 00:58:01,955
Whatever you think I've done, I'm sorry.

879
00:58:01,989 --> 00:58:03,023
- (laughing) What do you think, Buddy?

880
00:58:03,057 --> 00:58:04,857
Does he really mean it?

881
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:08,427
Buddy doesn't really think you're sorry! (chuckles)

882
00:58:12,262 --> 00:58:15,130
(Tom screaming) (Lester cackling)

883
00:58:25,937 --> 00:58:28,938

884
00:58:38,078 --> 00:58:40,145
(background conversations)

885
00:58:41,979 --> 00:58:43,947
- Hey, you KFAT partyers,

886
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,749
welcome to the annual Pig Out!

887
00:58:45,782 --> 00:58:48,684
(crowd cheering and applauding)

888
00:58:48,717 --> 00:58:50,985
We got the champions here from the battle of the bands,

889
00:58:51,019 --> 00:58:52,886
The Playground Slap, and they're gonna be doing a thing

890
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,420
for us in just a little while but first,

891
00:58:54,454 --> 00:58:56,455
for the folks listenin' live at home,

892
00:58:56,488 --> 00:58:57,556
let's do three big "sewies" on a count of three.

893
00:58:57,589 --> 00:58:58,723
One.

894
00:58:58,757 --> 00:58:59,423
Two.

895
00:59:00,191 --> 00:59:01,025
Three!

896
00:59:01,624 --> 00:59:02,425
- [Crowd] Sewie!

897
00:59:03,193 --> 00:59:04,893
Sewie!

898
00:59:06,128 --> 00:59:08,629
Sewie!

899
00:59:08,663 --> 00:59:09,930
(cheering and applauding)

(rumbling) (screaming)

915
01:00:48,955 --> 01:00:50,991
- [Fogel] Whoa, that's what happens when you

916
01:00:51,024 --> 01:00:52,758
rock and roll a little too hard there.

917
01:00:52,791 --> 01:00:53,858
Just a little power failure, there is a storm you know.

918
01:00:55,293 --> 01:00:57,494
If you wanna just exit out that back door or the side doors

919
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,562
here and everyone don't panic anybody, it's okay.

920
01:01:00,463 --> 01:01:02,531
(crowd murmuring)

921
01:01:09,768 --> 01:01:11,802
- That party's a bit of a drag.

922
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:12,503
- You just don't like to dance.

923
01:01:13,571 --> 01:01:15,238
- I just like to party!

924
01:01:19,908 --> 01:01:21,742
- Hey, you know now's the time to shoot the slaughterhouse

925
01:01:21,775 --> 01:01:22,476
with the lightning and all.

926
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:25,077
- Are you kidding me?

927
01:01:25,111 --> 01:01:27,279
Who in their right mind would wanna hang around that

928
01:01:27,312 --> 01:01:28,313
dirty, smelly old slaughterhouse at night?

929
01:01:30,214 --> 01:01:31,814
- That place is scary enough during the day,

930
01:01:31,848 --> 01:01:33,049
I wouldn't wanna be there at night.

931
01:01:33,082 --> 01:01:34,716
- Aw, are you scared?

932
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:35,417
- I think you're just scared.

933
01:01:35,884 --> 01:01:38,352
- Yeah!

934
01:01:38,386 --> 01:01:40,353
- If you guys are so macho, why don't you go out there?

935
01:01:40,387 --> 01:01:41,287
- Yeah, put your money where your mouth is.

936
01:01:43,255 --> 01:01:44,556
- Okay.

937
01:01:45,356 --> 01:01:47,591
Ten bucks

938
01:01:47,624 --> 01:01:48,791
says you won't last an hour out there.

939
01:01:48,824 --> 01:01:50,526
- Yeah, alone.

940
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:51,526
- Make it worth my while.

941
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,260
Make it 20.

942
01:01:53,228 --> 01:01:53,894
- They've never seen a 20, Liz.

943
01:01:54,829 --> 01:01:55,963
(girls giggle)

944
01:01:55,996 --> 01:01:56,429
- I'll toss in 10.

945
01:01:57,664 --> 01:02:00,132
- Okay.

946
01:02:00,165 --> 01:02:01,033
20 bucks says you won't last an hour in that old place.

947
01:02:03,733 --> 01:02:05,569
(thunder roaring)

948
01:02:06,669 --> 01:02:09,204
- You're on. (thunder claps)

949
01:02:18,476 --> 01:02:20,044
(thunder claps)

950
01:02:22,612 --> 01:02:24,813
- We should have held out for 40 bucks

951
01:02:24,846 --> 01:02:25,480
'cause of this storm, Annie.

952
01:02:31,217 --> 01:02:33,352
- Jan, give Dave's wife a call

953
01:02:33,385 --> 01:02:34,919
and see if he's reported home.

954
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:39,021
Jan, don't get her alarmed,

955
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:40,656
but something crazy's goin' on here.

956
01:02:44,091 --> 01:02:46,292
(thunder booming)

957
01:02:54,197 --> 01:02:55,932
- Let's go back to the party, this is really dumb.

958
01:02:57,132 --> 01:02:59,434
- Uh, and lose the chance of a lifetime?

959
01:02:59,467 --> 01:03:00,468
To show up these guys and make 20 bucks doin' it?

960
01:03:01,501 --> 01:03:02,970
- Oh, that's what I like, spirit.

961
01:03:05,371 --> 01:03:07,572
Now, if you girls want us to come pick you up,

962
01:03:07,606 --> 01:03:10,674
just signal with this.

963
01:03:10,708 --> 01:03:12,208
We will be down the road, sippin' a few cool ones.

964
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:17,144
- See you, girls.

965
01:03:17,178 --> 01:03:17,678
- [Skip] Bye! - [Buzz] In an hour.

966
01:03:24,349 --> 01:03:25,316
(thunder) - Or less.

967
01:03:26,917 --> 01:03:27,351
(Skip and Buzz chuckling)

968
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:33,654
(thunder roaring)

969
01:03:36,656 --> 01:03:38,157
(thunder clap)

970
01:03:47,162 --> 01:03:48,464
- [Liz] Hi, I'm Skip!

971
01:03:49,063 --> 01:03:51,098
And I'm Buzz!

972
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:53,233
And we're really stupid!

973
01:03:53,267 --> 01:03:54,200
'Cause we're gonna lose 20 bucks!

974
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:56,268
Yeah!

975
01:03:56,301 --> 01:03:56,701
(Annie and Liz giggling)

976
01:03:58,736 --> 01:04:00,537
That was dumb!

977
01:04:00,571 --> 01:04:02,472
So was this.

978
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:03,339
- [Annie] I know, I can't believe we're doing this.

979
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,874
(gasps)

980
01:04:06,907 --> 01:04:08,042
What do you think?

981
01:04:09,109 --> 01:04:10,443
- I think you go first.

982
01:04:10,477 --> 01:04:11,076
- No way, it's your 20 bucks!

983
01:04:13,645 --> 01:04:14,946
- What do you say we split it, and we'll go together?

984
01:04:14,979 --> 01:04:17,014
- Deal.

985
01:04:24,618 --> 01:04:25,352
(pigs squealing) (thunder roaring)

986
01:04:33,324 --> 01:04:36,292
- [Buzz] Skip, wait up.

987
01:04:36,325 --> 01:04:38,127
I can't see worth a damn in this thing.

988
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,695
- [Skip] Just follow me!

989
01:04:40,728 --> 01:04:41,361
- [Buzz] Just take it easy.

990
01:04:49,667 --> 01:04:51,067
(pigs squealing)

991
01:04:52,135 --> 01:04:53,002
- [Skip] Oh, are you alright?

992
01:04:53,036 --> 01:04:54,136
- [Buzz] Yeah.

993
01:04:54,169 --> 01:04:54,536
Crap, I lost my beer.

994
01:04:56,971 --> 01:04:59,205
Oh God, hog shit!

995
01:05:00,206 --> 01:05:00,740
I hate pigs.

996
01:05:02,574 --> 01:05:04,709
- [Skip] Just take off that stupid mask and let's get goin'!

997
01:05:04,742 --> 01:05:06,043
- [Buzz] Oh, once it's on I get used to it.

998
01:05:09,845 --> 01:05:11,713
(dark ambient music)

999
01:05:27,956 --> 01:05:31,692
(thunder roaring)

1000
01:06:00,209 --> 01:06:02,811
- 152 to central.

1001
01:06:02,844 --> 01:06:04,545
- [Jan] This is central.

1002
01:06:04,578 --> 01:06:05,879
- Patch me through to the Medford County

1003
01:06:05,913 --> 01:06:06,479
sheriff's department.

1004
01:06:09,481 --> 01:06:10,449
(rattling) (scratching)

1005
01:06:20,722 --> 01:06:22,189
- [Liz] Annie, we should have held out for 40 bucks,

1006
01:06:22,222 --> 01:06:24,423
look at this place.

1007
01:06:24,457 --> 01:06:25,358
- [Annie] Yeah, it's straight out of Good Housekeeping, huh?

1008
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:29,226
(rattling) (scratching)

1009
01:06:31,127 --> 01:06:32,795
- I knew it!

1010
01:06:36,097 --> 01:06:37,231
I got an idea.

1011
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:41,667
I'm gonna find a way out and sneak around behind these guys.

1012
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,268
- Oh Liz, I really think it would be better

1013
01:06:43,302 --> 01:06:44,669
if we stuck together here.

1014
01:06:44,702 --> 01:06:45,303
- No, you stay here and act as bait.

1015
01:06:46,737 --> 01:06:47,637
I'm gonna go down behind and scare the hell out of them.

1016
01:06:55,709 --> 01:06:57,710
(dark ambient music) (thunder roaring)

1017
01:07:00,879 --> 01:07:02,313
- [Skip] Buzz, buzz.

1018
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:04,013
Listen.

1019
01:07:04,047 --> 01:07:04,447
You go around this way.

1020
01:07:06,048 --> 01:07:07,883
I'm gonna go around this way,

1021
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:09,784
see if you can't find some place to sneak in.

1022
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,485
- [Buzz] Well how about the front door?

1023
01:07:11,518 --> 01:07:13,019
- [Skip] No no no no no, that's too obvious.

1024
01:07:13,053 --> 01:07:14,587
We gotta be sneaky about this.

1025
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:15,254
- [Buzz] Oh yeah, this is gonna be great!

1026
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:28,229
(creaking)

1027
01:07:36,933 --> 01:07:39,235
(tense atmospheric music)

1028
01:08:37,770 --> 01:08:40,172
(Skip groans)

1029
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:48,277
- Oh Skip, come on!

1030
01:08:48,309 --> 01:08:50,711
Skip, cut it out, okay?

1031
01:08:50,745 --> 01:08:51,878
Will you stop it?

1032
01:08:52,913 --> 01:08:53,180
Stop! (Skip grunts)

1033
01:08:53,846 --> 01:08:55,880
You're gross.

1034
01:08:55,914 --> 01:08:58,482
(chuckles) Oh God.

1035
01:08:58,515 --> 01:08:59,416
I can tell that it's you, why don't you just cut it out?

1036
01:09:00,784 --> 01:09:02,185
Gross!

1037
01:09:02,218 --> 01:09:03,585
Oh come,

1038
01:09:03,618 --> 01:09:04,619
Skip,

1039
01:09:04,653 --> 01:09:05,754
Skip!

1040
01:09:05,787 --> 01:09:07,221
(screams)

1041
01:09:07,822 --> 01:09:09,389
(screaming)

1042
01:09:11,924 --> 01:09:13,458
(Buddy grunts)

1043
01:09:14,959 --> 01:09:17,360
(Annie screaming and panting)

1044
01:09:27,266 --> 01:09:28,667
- [Liz] Annie!

1045
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,905
Skip!

1046
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:40,308
Buzz!

1047
01:09:49,046 --> 01:09:49,913
(creaking)

1048
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:56,450
Annie?

1049
01:09:57,885 --> 01:09:58,918
(thunder clap)

1050
01:10:14,328 --> 01:10:16,562
(Buzz makes whooshing sounds)

1051
01:10:17,497 --> 01:10:19,364
(clattering and grinding)

1052
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:29,303
(grunting from behind)

1053
01:10:29,337 --> 01:10:29,837
- [Buzz] Skip?

1054
01:10:33,706 --> 01:10:35,374
Skip, you nearly scared the shit out of me!

1055
01:10:35,407 --> 01:10:36,808
(Buddy squeals sharply)

1056
01:10:36,841 --> 01:10:37,475
(thud)

1057
01:10:40,544 --> 01:10:41,577
(Buddy snorts and grunts)

1058
01:10:53,251 --> 01:10:56,219
(dark atmospheric music) - [Liz] Skip?

1059
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:00,489
(thunder clap)

1060
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:03,357
Control.

1061
01:11:10,162 --> 01:11:11,829
Annie!

1062
01:11:16,064 --> 01:11:16,798
(roaring thunder)

1063
01:11:25,137 --> 01:11:27,906
Annie?

1064
01:11:34,643 --> 01:11:35,544
Skip?

1065
01:11:37,545 --> 01:11:38,678
Come on, you guys, you can keep your 20 bucks.

1066
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:42,614
(Annie screaming in distance)

1067
01:11:42,648 --> 01:11:43,481
Annie?

1068
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:49,351
(door creaking)

1069
01:11:51,186 --> 01:11:51,819
Annie?

1070
01:11:58,223 --> 01:11:59,324
Skip.

1071
01:12:00,292 --> 01:12:01,625
Buzz.

1072
01:12:02,626 --> 01:12:03,493
Come on, you guys, I've had enough.

1073
01:12:06,028 --> 01:12:07,930
I'm ready to call it quits.

1074
01:12:15,234 --> 01:12:17,368
Annie!

1075
01:12:26,707 --> 01:12:27,841
(screams)

1076
01:12:29,776 --> 01:12:31,376
(Liz screaming) (thunder booming)

1077
01:12:46,385 --> 01:12:48,887
(Liz sobbing)

1078
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:53,723
- This little pig went to market.

1079
01:12:54,557 --> 01:12:57,726
This little pig stayed home.

1080
01:12:57,759 --> 01:13:01,294
This little pig had roast beef.

1081
01:13:01,328 --> 01:13:04,597
And this little pig had none.

1082
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:07,498
And this little pig ran wee wee wee,

1083
01:13:07,532 --> 01:13:10,233
all the way home!

1084
01:13:10,267 --> 01:13:11,467
(cackling) (Liz screaming)

1085
01:13:15,603 --> 01:13:17,571
- [Jan] Go ahead, sheriff.

1086
01:13:17,605 --> 01:13:19,038
- I've got an emergency over here, Al,

1087
01:13:19,072 --> 01:13:20,440
can I get some help from your county?

1088
01:13:20,473 --> 01:13:22,608
- [Voiceover] You bet, Fred.

1089
01:13:22,641 --> 01:13:23,507
We'll get 'em right out there to ya.

1090
01:13:23,541 --> 01:13:25,376
- Thanks, Al.

1091
01:13:25,409 --> 01:13:26,843
I may need 'em for the next couple of days.

1092
01:13:26,876 --> 01:13:28,377
- [Voiceover] No sweat, we'll manage.

1093
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:30,512
Uh, speaking of missing persons,

1094
01:13:30,546 --> 01:13:31,346
you haven't seen Tom Sanford over there, have you?

1095
01:13:32,614 --> 01:13:34,281
- Not since this morning.

1096
01:13:34,314 --> 01:13:36,449
And, uh,

1097
01:13:36,482 --> 01:13:36,916
he was headed back towards his plant.

1098
01:13:39,117 --> 01:13:40,985
- [Voiceover] His old lady's upset 'cause he

1099
01:13:41,018 --> 01:13:41,485
hasn't been home yet.

1100
01:13:42,653 --> 01:13:44,153
Listen, we'll get those men right out to ya.

1101
01:13:44,187 --> 01:13:45,455
Keep me posted.

1102
01:13:45,488 --> 01:13:46,021
- Thanks, Al.

1103
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:51,057
Car 152 to central.

1104
01:13:52,759 --> 01:13:54,760
- [Jan] Go ahead, sheriff.

1105
01:13:54,793 --> 01:13:56,728
- Jan, any word on Murdock?

1106
01:13:56,761 --> 01:13:59,096
- [Jan] Mrs. Murdock called his office again.

1107
01:13:59,129 --> 01:14:01,330
But his answering machine's on and it says the same thing.

1108
01:14:01,364 --> 01:14:02,732
That he's out with a client and he'll return about three.

1109
01:14:06,033 --> 01:14:08,301
- Sanford.

1110
01:14:08,334 --> 01:14:10,602
Murdock.

1111
01:14:10,636 --> 01:14:12,037
Out with a client?

1112
01:14:15,306 --> 01:14:16,606
Murdock out with Sanford.

1113
01:14:21,275 --> 01:14:22,844
Jan, let me know the minute you hear anything about Murdock.

1114
01:14:25,278 --> 01:14:28,713
I'm gonna play a hunch.

1115
01:14:28,747 --> 01:14:30,215
(Liz sobbing and whining)

1116
01:14:30,248 --> 01:14:31,582
- Believe me, your friends never felt a thing.

1117
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:34,450
A large price to pay for trespassin'.

1118
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:39,286
Easy on her, son.

1119
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:40,321
We don't wanna hurt her.

1120
01:14:40,354 --> 01:14:41,621
Yet.

1121
01:14:42,555 --> 01:14:42,989
What's your name, miss?

1122
01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:48,358
- [Liz] Liz.

1123
01:14:48,392 --> 01:14:48,992
(Liz sobs)

1124
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,027
Borden!

1125
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:51,861
- Borden?

1126
01:14:52,461 --> 01:14:53,795
Lizzie Borden?

1127
01:14:53,828 --> 01:14:54,796
Well I'll be a suckling mule!

1128
01:14:55,529 --> 01:14:56,997
The sheriff's daughter?

1129
01:14:57,831 --> 01:14:59,699
Lizzie Borden?

1130
01:14:59,732 --> 01:15:00,732
(Liz whining and sobbing)

1131
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,234
You know, this is almost better than

1132
01:15:03,267 --> 01:15:03,768
having your old man here.

1133
01:15:05,136 --> 01:15:06,636
Gives Buddy something to play with besides himself.

1134
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,072
(Buddy grunting)

1135
01:15:13,373 --> 01:15:15,875
Tender as a suckling pig.

1136
01:15:19,678 --> 01:15:21,645
Used to get a lot of call for suckling.

1137
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,681
Folks used to have big pig roasts every summer.

1138
01:15:26,348 --> 01:15:28,749
Lots of 'em.

1139
01:15:28,783 --> 01:15:29,950
(sighs) Times have changed.

1140
01:15:33,519 --> 01:15:34,987
These knives, each one has its own purpose.

1141
01:15:36,587 --> 01:15:38,789
Bonin', carvin', slicin'.

1142
01:15:40,690 --> 01:15:42,658
This one's specially made for skinnin' off the hide.

1143
01:15:43,358 --> 01:15:46,060
(Liz screaming)

1144
01:15:46,093 --> 01:15:47,461
I can skin a hide off a hog in 30 seconds.

1145
01:15:49,328 --> 01:15:51,496
Without jigglin' one ounce of fat.

1146
01:15:55,832 --> 01:15:57,300
(Buddy squeals) (Liz screaming)

1147
01:15:57,334 --> 01:15:58,400
Don't scare the poor thing, boy!

1148
01:15:59,668 --> 01:16:01,836
Take off that damn mask!

1149
01:16:01,869 --> 01:16:03,503
(Liz sobbing)

1150
01:16:08,373 --> 01:16:10,041
That's better.

1151
01:16:10,841 --> 01:16:12,042
(Buddy groaning)

1152
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:15,844
(Liz screaming)

1153
01:16:15,877 --> 01:16:16,812
Most folks prefer not to think how their

1154
01:16:17,779 --> 01:16:20,880
steaks and chops are produced.

1155
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:23,282
No, they just pick 'em up all wrapped in plastic

1156
01:16:23,315 --> 01:16:24,917
in neat little disposable trays and never give it a thought.

1157
01:16:28,218 --> 01:16:30,387
People think butcherin' is a crass, violent way.

1158
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:35,356
But they don't realize that a good meat cutter

1159
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:37,758
must have the knowledge of anatomy,

1160
01:16:37,791 --> 01:16:40,126
and the skilled hands of a surgeon.

1161
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:42,561
(Liz sobbing and screaming)

1162
01:16:49,431 --> 01:16:51,099
Delicate, but not much meat.

1163
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:54,134
Good for soup. (chuckles)

1164
01:16:55,668 --> 01:16:58,002
Did you know that one of the most sensitive parts

1165
01:16:58,036 --> 01:17:00,437
of the human body is the fingertip?

1166
01:17:00,471 --> 01:17:02,939
It's just that the tiny cut on the fingertip

1167
01:17:02,972 --> 01:17:04,574
is more painful than a slice across the belly.

1168
01:17:07,908 --> 01:17:10,777
(Liz screaming)

1169
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:16,748
(Lester chuckles)

1170
01:17:24,152 --> 01:17:25,120
(Liz screams loudly)

1171
01:17:28,521 --> 01:17:29,555
You see what I mean? It helps to know the

1172
01:17:30,522 --> 01:17:31,957
beast you're going to carve.

1173
01:17:34,225 --> 01:17:37,527
Little girl, I bet I could skin you out in 90 seconds flat,

1174
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,895
and dress you out in less than three minutes!

1175
01:17:43,463 --> 01:17:45,731
(Liz screaming)

1176
01:17:46,532 --> 01:17:50,001
(thunder booming)

1177
01:18:03,242 --> 01:18:05,310
Recognize this one, little girl?

1178
01:18:05,344 --> 01:18:07,411
(Liz screaming)

1179
01:18:07,445 --> 01:18:08,478
Watch closely and you'll see what I'm gonna do to you.

1180
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:11,981
(Liz screaming and sobbing)

1181
01:18:21,887 --> 01:18:22,521
(thud)

1182
01:18:23,921 --> 01:18:24,488
(splatter)

1183
01:18:31,192 --> 01:18:32,160
(Liz screams loudly)

1184
01:18:40,931 --> 01:18:43,065
(Lester screams) (dramatic music)

1185
01:18:45,067 --> 01:18:47,669
Get her, damnit!

1186
01:18:47,702 --> 01:18:49,036
(Liz screaming) (clanging)

1187
01:18:59,075 --> 01:19:01,110
(Buddy squealing)

1188
01:19:04,045 --> 01:19:06,213
(Liz screams)

1189
01:19:07,014 --> 01:19:09,048
(Buddy snorting)

1190
01:19:09,649 --> 01:19:11,550
(Liz screaming)

1191
01:19:31,895 --> 01:19:35,031
- Hold it right there!

1192
01:19:36,398 --> 01:19:37,566
(gunshot) (chink)

1193
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:38,933
(Buddy squeals)

1194
01:20:02,414 --> 01:20:03,848
(pig squeals)

1195
01:20:04,481 --> 01:20:05,782
(Liz screams)

1196
01:20:09,218 --> 01:20:10,518
Where are the others?

1197
01:20:10,551 --> 01:20:10,885
- (sobbing) They're dead.

1198
01:20:11,652 --> 01:20:13,320
They're all dead.

1199
01:20:13,353 --> 01:20:14,855
- Come on, we gotta get the hell out of here.

1200
01:20:14,888 --> 01:20:15,222
(thud) - [Liz] No!

1201
01:20:15,621 --> 01:20:17,022
No! No!

1202
01:20:18,656 --> 01:20:20,290
- You're next, little pig. (tense music)

1203
01:20:23,626 --> 01:20:25,228
(gunshot)

1204
01:20:28,128 --> 01:20:29,296
(Liz whines)

1205
01:20:35,366 --> 01:20:37,301
(Liz sobs)

1206
01:21:17,825 --> 01:21:18,993
(Liz screams)

1207
01:21:22,828 --> 01:21:23,929
(thuds on window) - [Liz] Dad, the keys.

1208
01:21:30,833 --> 01:21:32,867
(whining and sobbing) (Lester groans)

1209
01:21:44,308 --> 01:21:45,341
(engine revving)

1210
01:22:18,228 --> 01:22:20,629
(thud)

1211
01:22:24,899 --> 01:22:26,166
(sobbing) It's okay, dad.

1212
01:22:26,199 --> 01:22:27,000
I'll get you to the hospital.

1213
01:22:39,608 --> 01:22:41,275
- [Sheriff] Liz.

1214
01:22:41,309 --> 01:22:42,109
The radio.

1215
01:22:42,876 --> 01:22:44,644
Call for help.

1216
01:22:45,444 --> 01:22:47,012

01:22:51,848 --> 01:22:54,250
