- Grade 12.
- Ready for college?

8
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:16,035
I'm not going to college.

9
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:17,829
Why not? You look smart.

10
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,457
I'm better at taking care
of my little brother and dad.

11
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,046
Joon-kyung!

12
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,339
What's this?

13
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,552
My little brother placed
first in a math contest.

14
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:36,888
Not in the school,
but the whole province!

15
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:39,891
- Wow!
- Amazing!

16
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,894
Way to go, Joon-kyung!

17
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,857
You know Chang-sik in Bongha?

18
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:48,860
Joon-kyung should
go to Seoul to study too!

19
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:51,863
But Chang-sik is slow
compared to Joon-kyung!

20
00:01:51,864 --> 00:01:52,905
Right!

21
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,234
Come on. Let's go.

22
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:39,282
Why buy so much food?

23
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:42,871
- It's my husband's birthday tomorrow.
- Really?

24
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,752
You said it.

25
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,096

26
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:03,015

Long johns in March?

36
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:57,277
Don't need 'em!

44

Where are the gloves, I gave you?

45
00:05:02,134 --> 00:05:05,096
Wear these.

46
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:06,681
No! You wear 'em.

47
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,723
- Just wear 'em.
- No!

48
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:11,062
Wear 'em for Pete's sake!

49
00:05:11,063 --> 00:05:13,065
<i>There are no car roads to our village.</i>

50
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,899
<i>I'm not joking.</i>

51
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,403
<i>There's only a railway through here,</i>

52
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,404
<i>but no station.</i>

53
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:25,994
<i>So the only way out is to walk
the railway to Seungbu Station.</i>

54
00:05:28,368 --> 00:05:29,789
It's okay.

55
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:39,007
<i>We need to pass 3 tunnels
and 3 bridges to get there.</i>

56
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:53,728
<i>We can avoid passenger
trains as they run on schedules,</i>

57
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,814
<i>but not the freight trains.</i>

58
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:58,482
<i>So many people died in
the tunnels and bridges.</i>

59
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:03,279
Still scared? Silly boy.

60
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:12,412
Here.

61
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:14,581
You first.

62
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,583
Just drink it.

63
00:06:36,148 --> 00:06:38,150
Aren't you going to greet Dad?

64
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:41,025
Huh?

65
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,279
TO YEONGJU

66
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,282
Hold on a second.

67
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:47,906
Here.

68
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,994
It's for your first day of high school.

69
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:52,535
Buy a book with it.

70
00:06:52,536 --> 00:06:54,205
It's okay, sir.

71
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,414
Why you!

72
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:59,211
When an adult gives you
something, just say thanks and take it.

73
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:00,835
Thank you.

74
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:01,836
Good.

75
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:07,678
Disappointed your dad can't
go to your first day ceremony?

76
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:10,138
I'm not a kid. Why would I be?

77
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:11,306
Right.

78
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:12,308
You're not a kid.

79
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,686
- Study hard!
- Yes, sir.

80
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:22,817

00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:23,818

<i>I'm not writing this because it

83
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,328
<i>I just want our
villagers to travel safely.</i>

84
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:36,288
<i>Please build a way station here?</i>

85
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:39,999
I can't go on! Get off.

86
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,753
Why are you so heavy?

87
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,255
See you later.

88
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,425
Okay. Go on.

89
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,135
- Be careful!
- Okay!

92
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:58,977
<i>Today marks the first day
of your high school years.</i>

93
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,480
When will he stop?

94
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,234
<i>Your hopes and dreams...</i>

95
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:05,777
Is there no such
thing as shy principals?

96
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:10,697
There is. My elementary
school principal.

97
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,159
Really?

98
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,162
He was so shiny.

99
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:44,022
<i>I trust you'll learn and
grow here at Yeongbin High</i>

100
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,566
<i>and graduate as able adults.</i>

101
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,569
<i>Dear new students,</i>

102
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,199
I...

103
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,343
- He's weird.
- Sure is.

104
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,678
One.

105
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,015
- Kid.
- Yes?

106
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:18,182
Hold the bouquet here.

107
00:09:19,311 --> 00:09:22,061
It's okay. Please take it like this.

108
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,732
Okay, then.

109
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:28,360
One, two, three!

110
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,194
YEONGJU STATION

111
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,695
<i>I tried too.</i>

112
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:35,451
Why wouldn't I ask for a
way station at Wongok?

113
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:36,951
So?

114
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:42,665
Seungbu and Buncheon stations
could close due to low usage.

115
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,708
They yelled at me for
suggesting to build a new one.

116
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:48,919
So you didn't get to say anything?

117
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,673
Of course I did.

118
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,759
I asked to keep Seungbu
Station running at least.

119
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,425
We asked for a station,

120
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:56,303
not to save Seungbu Station!

121
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:57,349
I'm sorry, sir.

122
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:02,394
Please, sir. He didn't
do anything wrong.

123
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:08,524
Tae-yoon? Why are you so quiet?

124
00:10:09,733 --> 00:10:11,150
I got nothing to say.

125
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:13,196
You're a train driver!

126
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:15,490
What power do I have?

127
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:17,784
I just drive to a set schedule.

128
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:19,371
How frustrating!

129
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,082
What do we do now?

130
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:27,919
First, we should fight to
keep Seungbu Station at least.

131
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,130
What are you all up to?

132
00:10:31,883 --> 00:10:33,840
Seungbu Station could be shut down,

133
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,927
so we're all taking
turns to ride it more.

134
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:38,721
They'll close Seungbu Station?

135
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,139
I heard that could happen.

136
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,521
Wait.

137
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,147
You're Bo-kyung's brother, right?

138
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,064
Yes, I am.

139
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:54,654
I knew it! You grew so much!

140
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:57,032
Is Bo-kyung well?

141
00:10:58,742 --> 00:10:59,742
Yes.

142
00:11:03,623 --> 00:11:04,956
Are you going to...

143
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,959
Yeongju Station?

144
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:12,880
AVOID TRAFFIC JAMS
ARRIVE ON TIME WITH TRAINS

145
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:19,053
Sure your daycare
bus is coming at 8:30?

146
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:20,095
Don't know.

147
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,978
- Is this the right spot?
- Don't know.

148
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,448
- What's wrong?
- Pee!

149
00:11:37,657 --> 00:11:38,697
What?

150
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,698
Pee-pee!

151
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:05,140
5 minutes left.

152
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,009
Collect the tests!

153
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,973
Put your answers on the card.

154
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:57,609
That guy is a genius.

155
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,032
That's crazy.

156
00:13:01,741 --> 00:13:03,282
I have proof.

157
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,952
What proof?

158
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,793
Really?

159
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:16,627
There's more.

160
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,892
That's not all.

161
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:31,643
This one proves it for sure.

162
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:33,565
What is it?

163
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,147
Let me see your palm.

164
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:38,148
Palm?

165
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:39,943
Let me see your nails.

166
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,613
People do this 100%.

167
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,199
What did he do?

168
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,083
That's insane!

169
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,544
Dang.

170
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,502
What the heck?

171
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:48,055
- What is it?
- Do you like me?

172
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,472
Huh?

173
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:50,890
Come on.

174
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,725
I know you like me.

175
00:14:56,311 --> 00:14:57,437
What the heck?

176
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:09,032
<i>A! A! Abracadabra!</i>

177
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,287
<i>Today is...</i>

178
00:15:13,953 --> 00:15:15,955
It's Dad's birthday next week.

179
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,625
When he comes this weekend,

180
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,918
how about writing him a card?

181
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,004
Forget it.

182
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:24,131
Why would I?

183
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:26,886
Not again!

184
00:15:28,968 --> 00:15:30,930
How about getting him some socks?

185
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:34,100
Since when did we exchange gifts?

186
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,103
You're in high school now.

187
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:39,938
Can't you do it first?

188
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,940
Nope.

189
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,236
Forget it.

190
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:50,201
No way.

191
00:15:58,081 --> 00:15:59,791
MAILBOX

192
00:16:07,218 --> 00:16:08,884
He must have a girl.

193
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:13,557
That nerd?

194
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,735
What are you doing?

195
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:25,776
Keep watch.

196
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,318
Are you out of your mind?

197
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:30,990
What is this?

198
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:34,492
It's my friend's abstract
for his doctoral thesis.

199
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,827
Go through it.

200
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,621
Me?

201
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:39,998
Why?

202
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,878
You've read all the
books in the library.

203
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:47,923
What's that?

204
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,342
The President?

205
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:54,472
You can't open it!

206
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:56,475
Just keep watch!

207
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,943
Jeez!

208
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,155
Who do you think you are?

209
00:17:13,072 --> 00:17:15,787
I'm SONG La-hee.

210
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,414
I'm KIM Gwang-ja.

211
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,615
How's school?

212
00:17:58,746 --> 00:17:59,746
Fine.

213
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:32,527
How long will you live out here?

214
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,368
Don't start.

215
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,618
Isn't it time to come to your senses?

216
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,160
I never lost my senses.

217
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:43,875
You're not a kid anymore.

218
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,540
It's crazy to keep asking
about the way station.

219
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:47,918
What's wrong with that?

220
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,003
It makes no sense!

221
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,169
Why doesn't it?

222
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,332
I'm sorry. I apologize.

223
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,636
Who writes a letter
with country accents

224
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,971
and spelling mistakes?

225
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,682
How can you move the
President with a letter like that?

226
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:51,859
Letters must be written
with delicate care.

227
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:57,737
I can explain later. Want
help with the way station?

228
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,301
Did I tell you my dad is a congressman?

229
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:37,944
Dumplings.

230
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,947
DUMBLINGS

231
00:20:43,282 --> 00:20:44,827
What's this?

232
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,161
A field trip.

233
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,247
“The machine ate my coin.”

234
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,790
“The machine ate my...”

235
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,290
What?

236
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:01,759
What's this got to
do with a way station?

237
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,302
Just do as I say!

238
00:21:04,303 --> 00:21:05,516
Stop it.

239
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:08,683
Come on!

240
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:14,773
I said stop.

241
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:16,943
Dang...

242
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,496
<i>I didn't see anything. Go on.</i>

243
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:31,330
See what?

244
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:33,416
Go on with what?

245
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:37,004
Write, 'sir'.

246
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:42,008
Not 'It's a petition'.

247
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,180
Add, 'sir'.

248
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:49,893
Jeez...

249
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,603
That's not it.

250
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,645
- What?
- Huh?

251
00:21:55,646 --> 00:21:57,068
- Huh?
- What?

252
00:22:03,863 --> 00:22:06,285
Two letters are better than one.

253
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,788
Let's go for some ice cream.

254
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:12,207
But I have to go now.

255
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:13,956
Already?

256
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,333
Sorry.

257
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,253
Can't people cross tunnels without you?

258
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:19,922
It's dangerous.

259
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:27,306
You're smart. Can't you
make a signal or something?

260
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,350
A signal?

261
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,069
Aren't you gonna tell me?

262
00:22:43,694 --> 00:22:45,116
It's a secret.

263
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,290
Why is it standing with
its legs spread apart?

264
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,499
It's walking.

265
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,338
How is it walking? It's
standing with its legs apart.

266
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:02,965
No! It's walking!

267
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,091
I'm trying to concentrate!

268
00:23:10,141 --> 00:23:11,682
Can't you tell me what it is?

269
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:15,562
I want to surprise you
when I'm done. Stop it.

270
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:17,563
Fine.

271
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,362
Don't mind me, then!

272
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,333
- Dang! Come and see it!
- Really?

273
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:41,836
What is it?

274
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,215
Dang.

275
00:23:45,965 --> 00:23:51,181
It's a signal that detects vibrations
to tell if a train is close or not.

276
00:23:51,182 --> 00:23:52,515
- Okay.
- Okay?

277
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:55,974
- This is a hand.
- Okay.

278
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:56,894
If the hand points...

279
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:57,895
Here.

280
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:00,439
What do we do?

281
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:04,942
Right.

282
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:09,032
Just stand there.
Don't go in the tunnel.

283
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:17,788
- Wow!
- Applause!

284
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:24,715
What if the hand points down to this?

285
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:38,769
If it points to this, it
means you can walk in.

286
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,020
Go?

287
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:43,022
Yes, go.

288
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,024
Go on.

289
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,611
Don't laugh.

290
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:54,117
He's smart!

291
00:24:58,913 --> 00:25:00,167
Wait!

292
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,243
I knew it.

293
00:25:37,288 --> 00:25:38,661
You're good!

294
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,335
Here.

295
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:46,252
More?

296
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,840
I got them as a favor. Study
and bring them back quickly.

297
00:25:56,014 --> 00:26:00,098
Is he helping or using me?

298
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:01,560
Why so much?

299
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,160
What are you doing?

300
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,288
What's that?

301
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:24,459
Nothing.

302
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:28,419
Who is your new study
buddy at school again?

303
00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:31,421
Who?

304
00:26:34,345 --> 00:26:35,553
- Gwang-su?
- Gwang-su.

305
00:26:35,554 --> 00:26:36,718
Why do you ask?

306
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:38,056
Bring the kid over sometime.

307
00:26:41,432 --> 00:26:43,270
He's got his own place.

308
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,065
Why would he come out here?

309
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,525
You haven't had a friend in a while.
Thanks to him, you're studying hard.

310
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,529
He's the one who should be thankful!

311
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:02,205
Why look at me like that?

312
00:27:04,163 --> 00:27:09,336
Why are you so worked up?

313
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,089
Why are you flushed?

314
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,257
- Go away!
- Come on! Tell me!

315
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:29,856
I get why they say men look
sexy when they're focused on work.

316
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,403
Dang. Cut it out.

317
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,694
- You love space that much?
- Yup.

318
00:27:36,695 --> 00:27:38,364
Why do you like it?

319
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,365
I like the stars.

320
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:41,159
For what?

321
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:46,957
It's a secret.

322
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,964
What now?

323
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:58,509
- Stop it.
- Look at the camera.

324
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,436
Is your dream to become an astronomer?

325
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,809
I can't afford to dream.

326
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,272
Why can't you?

327
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:15,402
Wanna know what my dream is?

328
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,657
You have a dream? What is it?

329
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:21,367
A muse.

330
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,455
What's that?

331
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,330
It just takes you becoming
a genius scientist.

332
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,831
Why do I gotta realize your dream?

333
00:28:29,832 --> 00:28:32,419
It's not that. I'll
make you realize it.

334
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:37,924
I don't get it. Whatever.

335
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,761
Wanna study in Seoul together?

336
00:28:43,762 --> 00:28:45,764
That's crazy!

337
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,979
I can ask my dad to send us together.

338
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,980
Forget it.

339
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,779
By the way,

340
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:03,994
did you ask your dad
about the way station?

341
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:05,951
I did.

342
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:07,204
What did he say?

343
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:10,080
He said to cut the
nonsense and go to bed.

344
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,377
Why?

345
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:19,510
- Were you gonna use my dad?
- What? No!

346
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:23,970
Get up.

347
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:32,185
It's an investment for
my dream, not yours.

348
00:29:32,186 --> 00:29:35,733
Stop reading books on
space and read novels too.

349
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:36,442
What's this?

350
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:37,567
MY MAN'S MAN

351
00:29:37,568 --> 00:29:38,568
Dang!

352
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,072
Why should I read this? I'm no girl.

353
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,417
Sleeping already?

354
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,886
What are you looking at?

355
00:30:04,887 --> 00:30:06,472
- Show me!
- Stop it!

356
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:07,473
Let's see!

357
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:09,931
Let's see!

358
00:30:09,932 --> 00:30:10,724
It's a textbook!

359
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:11,934
Stop it!

360
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:20,650
“My Man's Man?”

361
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:21,651
It's nothing.

362
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:30,160
- Are you dating Gwang-su?
- No.

363
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,590
It's not what you're thinking.

364
00:30:40,879 --> 00:30:42,131
It's okay.

365
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,593
- I understand.
- What?

366
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:45,383
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

367
00:30:45,384 --> 00:30:46,384
Gwang-su is...

368
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:48,221
...a girl.

369
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,141
Of course she is.

370
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,479
It's totally a boy's name.
You knew it was a girl?

371
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:02,028
- Did you ever date a guy?
- No!

372
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,363
- So you're dating a girl?
- No!

373
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:08,658
She's a friend.

374
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,624
Don't get any ideas.

375
00:31:15,914 --> 00:31:18,877
Why? Think I'd feel left out?

376
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,676
Why would I be?

377
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:29,804
I'm happy my little brother
grew up well and has a girlfriend.

378
00:31:35,017 --> 00:31:36,145
Really?

379
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:37,226
Yup.

380
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:39,229
Gwang-su will like it if
you wear a nice shirt.

381
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,152
It looks like Dad's shirt.

382
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:44,527
You're handsome. It doesn't matter.

383
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:46,071
Is that your dad's shirt?

384
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,162
Two bowls of noodles
and one rice cake, please.

385
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:55,498
<i>Coming right up!</i>

386
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:57,748
Can we order ice cream too?

387
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:00,249
Sure.

388
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,418
Ice cream too, please.

389
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,506
<i>Sure thing!</i>

390
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,510
- La-hee.
- What?

391
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:11,514
How about a slushy?

392
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:20,562
Back off!

393
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,355
I lost because of you!

394
00:32:22,356 --> 00:32:23,774
Think changing seats will work?

395
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:26,152
Go away!

396
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,445
Dang it!

397
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:34,785
I won!

398
00:32:59,518 --> 00:33:02,981
After all those letters, not one reply?

399
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,158
Do you have to make a way station?

400
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:15,285
Let's just move to Seoul.

401
00:33:19,121 --> 00:33:21,082
Doesn't your sister want to move?

402
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,083
No.

403
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,044
- Should I try talking to her?
- Forget it.

404
00:33:27,045 --> 00:33:30,047
Then why don't we just make it?

405
00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:32,050
How can we make a station?

406
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:34,096
Why not? How much do you need?

407
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:38,100
Drop the nonsense.

408
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,147
You can go on TV!

409
00:33:46,148 --> 00:33:47,777
SCHOLARSHIP QUIZ

410
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:50,068
What season is mentioned
in the national anthem?

411
00:33:52,446 --> 00:33:53,322
Time's up!

412
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,033
Will you take all night?

413
00:33:56,158 --> 00:33:57,951
What's Mozart's middle name?

414
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:58,576
What?

415
00:33:58,577 --> 00:34:01,624
It means 'love god' and was
mentioned in a recent film.

416
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:04,210
A four-syllable
word, starting with 'A'.

417
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,713
<i>Abracadabra!</i>

418
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:10,379
<i>Today is a special...</i>

419
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,380
<i>Tada!</i>

420
00:34:13,175 --> 00:34:14,969
Are you kidding me?

421
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:20,727
Snap to it!

422
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,356
What animal is the
mascot of the '88 Olympics?

423
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:27,897
Hodori!

424
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:29,736
A tiger! Stupid!

425
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,112
The capital city of America?

426
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,990
L.A.?

427
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,119
One plus one?

428
00:34:42,621 --> 00:34:43,621
Two!

429
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:50,380
478,329 times 85,127?

430
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:55,593
40 billion, 718 million, 712 thousand,

431
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,555
You're amazing!

432
00:34:58,556 --> 00:34:59,890
- 783!
- Whatever!

433
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:02,016
Look at this!

434
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:05,603
10ᵗʰ NATIONAL HIGH
SCHOOL MATH COMPETITION

435
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:07,064
A math contest?

436
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:08,357
FIRST, PRESIDENTIAL AWARD

437
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:09,566
The Presidential Award?

438
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:11,277
Go and ask him yourself!

439
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,261
What Presidential Award
when you can't even hold it!

440
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:41,763
It's not my fault I had to poo.

441
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:46,060
It's not my poo, but yours!
Whose fault is it then?

442
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:49,439
JUNG Joon-kyung won
the Presidential Award.

443
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:56,321
You'll go to Daegu on Friday
for the awards ceremony.

444
00:35:56,322 --> 00:36:00,325
Why is it at Daegu and not Seoul?

445
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:02,406
The superintendent of
education will present instead.

446
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:18,344
Let's just go to the President.

447
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,430
Been there?

448
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,641
Nope. You?

449
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:25,852
I've never been to Seoul.

450
00:36:29,063 --> 00:36:30,188
Wanna just go?

451
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:33,691
They may kick us out, but let's go!

452
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:36,154
Right. Let's go!

453
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,689
Writing letters is best.

454
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,488
The weather sucks and I'm bored.

455
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,570
Wanna watch a movie?

456
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,866
A movie?

457
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,668
This a movie theater?

458
00:37:35,669 --> 00:37:37,671
I didn't say we're
going to watch it there.

459
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:55,025
No one is home.

460
00:37:57,235 --> 00:37:58,316
Is this okay?

461
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:01,071
Why not? We're just watching a movie.

462
00:38:10,412 --> 00:38:11,412
What's this?

463
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:13,082
What?

464
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,336
It's your parents' room.

465
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,005
So?

466
00:38:20,714 --> 00:38:21,714
What?

467
00:38:22,632 --> 00:38:23,926
Are you gonna stand there?

468
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:40,278
What are you doing?

469
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:42,989
Aren't you uncomfortable?

470
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,579
I guess.

471
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:55,500
<i>Children in the past were scared
most by stories of tigers and wars.</i>

472
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:59,921
<i>These days, children
watch illegal videos</i>

473
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:03,549
<i>and suffer consequences of
becoming juvenile delinquents.</i>

474
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:10,888
<i>Select good programs to help
nurture good and kind natures.</i>

475
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:13,390
<i>Let's all be proper guides.</i>

476
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:15,184
Is it an action movie?

477
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:16,270
Adult movie.

478
00:39:44,134 --> 00:39:45,343
Why isn't it working?

479
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:02,276
- That was something.
- Yup.

480
00:40:03,733 --> 00:40:04,733
Right.

481
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,782
- Have you tried?
- What?

482
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,785
- What they did.
- Crazy?

483
00:40:15,537 --> 00:40:16,289
You?

484
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:17,915
- No, I haven't.
- Right.

485
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:26,047
Wanna try?

486
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,341
Are you insane?

487
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,722
Do you want to?

488
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,141
Do you?

489
00:40:43,565 --> 00:40:44,565
Should...

490
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:52,534
Should we try?

491
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:26,567
- What?
- Oh no!

492
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:29,694
Why?

493
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,697
- It's busted.
- How?

494
00:41:33,031 --> 00:41:34,616
It's all stuck!

495
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,202
What do we do?

496
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,248
It's tangled up.

497
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:47,088
Stop!

498
00:42:02,936 --> 00:42:04,145
Hi, Mom!

499
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,899
Joon-kyung is here for homework.

500
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:09,567
So you're Joon-kyung.

501
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:12,154
La-hee told me about you.

502
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:15,364
I'm making cutlets.

503
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:16,534
Stay for dinner.

504
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,120
Stay.

505
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,036
It's okay, ma'am.

506
00:42:36,013 --> 00:42:37,595
That was close!

507
00:43:10,172 --> 00:43:11,172
Hey.

508
00:43:11,841 --> 00:43:14,923
You're wanted by the principal.

509
00:43:14,924 --> 00:43:16,926
Go to his office.

510
00:43:17,927 --> 00:43:18,928
The principal?

511
00:43:32,942 --> 00:43:37,699
Congressman SONG wanted to see you.

512
00:43:39,741 --> 00:43:40,909
Would you like to tell him?

513
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,288
I heard about you from La-hee.

514
00:43:43,161 --> 00:43:43,952
Sir?

515
00:43:43,953 --> 00:43:47,749
We're moving La-hee to
Seoul after this semester.

516
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,960
Seoul is a better
environment to study in.

517
00:43:51,961 --> 00:43:53,507
Sir, it's not La-hee's fault.

518
00:43:54,756 --> 00:43:55,841
What do you mean?

519
00:43:57,175 --> 00:43:59,177
I said to do it. Right?

520
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,517
We didn't really touch.

521
00:44:05,767 --> 00:44:07,521
Well, maybe slightly.

522
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,273
I don't really remember.

523
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:14,067
I'll take responsibility
and quit school.

524
00:44:14,612 --> 00:44:16,614
Please let La-hee
continue studying here, sir.

525
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:20,117
We played pool!

526
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,161
I'm sorry, Dad.

527
00:44:25,623 --> 00:44:26,623
What pool?

528
00:44:29,543 --> 00:44:31,708
Listen Joon-kyung.

529
00:44:31,709 --> 00:44:34,547
Congressman is moving to Seoul.

530
00:44:34,548 --> 00:44:36,550
He'd like to take you
to study there too.

531
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,385
He'll sponsor you to
a science high school.

532
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:44,682
A science high school?

533
00:44:45,351 --> 00:44:47,143
Of course you should go!

534
00:44:47,144 --> 00:44:49,563
Say you'll go before
he changes his mind!

535
00:44:50,564 --> 00:44:52,566
But I gotta build the way station.

536
00:44:53,106 --> 00:44:56,318
If you become successful in Seoul,
making a station will be a breeze!

537
00:44:58,448 --> 00:45:02,992
I like living here with you more.

538
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:06,243
A chance like this doesn't come easy!

539
00:45:06,244 --> 00:45:07,913
Wanna be stuck here all your life?

540
00:45:32,189 --> 00:45:33,355
What brings you here?

541
00:45:35,693 --> 00:45:37,858
Got time? We need to talk.

542
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:40,322
I'm busy. Let's talk later.

543
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:30,660
Is she alive?

544
00:46:32,662 --> 00:46:35,417
Is she breathing?

545
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:37,918
<i>Wait.</i>

546
00:46:37,919 --> 00:46:39,421
<i>You're Bo-kyung's brother, right?</i>

547
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:02,859
Come on! Hurry!

548
00:47:26,884 --> 00:47:27,884
Tae-yoon.

549
00:47:29,262 --> 00:47:30,262
What is it?

550
00:47:31,517 --> 00:47:32,518
Bo-kyung...

551
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,145
Bo-kyung! No!

552
00:47:50,828 --> 00:47:52,245
Excuse me! Please!

553
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,164
Did you find her?

554
00:47:57,126 --> 00:47:58,251
You found her, right?

555
00:48:09,427 --> 00:48:10,556
Where's Bo-kyung?

556
00:48:14,644 --> 00:48:16,646
You couldn't find her?

557
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:49,802
<i>Sis!</i>

558
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:52,970
<i>Bo-kyung!</i>

559
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:55,724
<i>Where are you?</i>

560
00:48:57,603 --> 00:48:58,603
<i>Sis!</i>

561
00:49:04,357 --> 00:49:05,357
<i>Please!</i>

562
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:10,863
<i>Sis!</i>

563
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,494
Must you quit?

564
00:49:59,248 --> 00:50:00,790
You gotta make a living.

565
00:50:02,832 --> 00:50:07,713
I'll run a little card shop
or something and get by.

566
00:50:08,546 --> 00:50:11,717
Cut the nonsense and move
here. I'll find you a place.

567
00:50:13,426 --> 00:50:15,011
Why are you doing this?

568
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:18,932
PARK left to run a different route.
You're all I have to run this line.

569
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:22,059
Can't you help me?

570
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:22,872
Why'd you throw it away?

571
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:31,464
I fell trying not to lose that.

572
00:51:32,341 --> 00:51:33,341
Keep it.

573
00:51:33,843 --> 00:51:34,843
Is it really you?

574
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,426
Why? Scared?

575
00:51:42,852 --> 00:51:43,852
Were you dreaming?

576
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,018
Yes.

577
00:51:48,189 --> 00:51:49,189
Sleep tight.

578
00:52:13,382 --> 00:52:14,382
Sis!

579
00:52:14,924 --> 00:52:16,173
Are you okay?

580
00:52:16,674 --> 00:52:17,674
Does it hurt?

581
00:52:19,552 --> 00:52:20,970
It doesn't hurt at all.

582
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:26,936
I'm fine. Don't worry. You'll
have to take good care now.

583
00:52:28,269 --> 00:52:29,437
Promise?

584
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:32,025
No! Don't go!

585
00:52:32,565 --> 00:52:34,191
I can't do anything without you!

586
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,485
Joon-kyung...

587
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:40,990
I'll do whatever you say
and study really hard!

588
00:52:41,618 --> 00:52:43,620
So please don't go!

589
00:52:45,038 --> 00:52:46,039
Please!

590
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,835
Without Mom and you, how can I live?

591
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:55,881
Stay with me while
I live in this house?

592
00:52:57,006 --> 00:52:58,006
Please?

593
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:03,387
Ah, okay.

594
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:07,144
Just until you live in this house.

595
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:09,061
Thanks.

596
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:16,901
Open up!

597
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:20,405
Go by yourself! I'm staying here!

598
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:24,368
How can I move and
leave you here alone!

599
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:26,872
It's okay. I can stay with Bo-kyung.

600
00:53:28,037 --> 00:53:30,959
Why you! Are you crazy!

601
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,209
I don't care if I am!

602
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:36,044
Open up or I'll break the door down!

603
00:53:36,045 --> 00:53:37,590
Promise you'll let me stay!

604
00:53:45,975 --> 00:53:46,975
Let's go.

605
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:48,933
No!

606
00:53:49,895 --> 00:53:50,895
Let go!

607
00:53:50,896 --> 00:53:51,896
Come on!

608
00:54:10,287 --> 00:54:11,624
Your sister is gone!

609
00:54:14,419 --> 00:54:15,877
To me, she's still here.

610
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:42,838
Jung-hwa.

611
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,095
Did you eat?

612
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:52,681
How's kindergarten?

613
00:55:53,682 --> 00:55:54,682
Did you go?

614
00:56:47,864 --> 00:56:48,820
Hello?

615
00:56:48,821 --> 00:56:50,341
<i>Did you send a letter
to the President?</i>

616
00:56:55,164 --> 00:56:57,166
So is it a go or not?

617
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:00,333
The President gave permission.

618
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:06,298
But it could be years to set a budget,
buy land, and build the station.

619
00:57:06,299 --> 00:57:07,463
That means

620
00:57:07,464 --> 00:57:11,595
we can have a way station,
but there's no money to build it?

621
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:14,098
Not with the Olympics next year.

622
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:16,517
Will they build it after the Olympics?

623
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:20,477
We won't know until we get to it.

624
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:25,481
Anyway, it looks like it
won't be built anytime soon.

625
00:57:25,482 --> 00:57:26,482
Let's just make it.

626
00:57:32,573 --> 00:57:34,119
I'm not joking.

627
00:57:34,911 --> 00:57:36,913
We got the permission, right?

628
00:57:38,623 --> 00:57:39,708
Let's build it ourselves.

629
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:02,186
This came for you.

630
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,575
- Aren't you leaving?
- Nope.

631
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:17,454
- You wanna hear?
- Yup.

632
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:22,458
- No way!
- Just play it!

633
00:58:22,459 --> 00:58:23,459
- No!
- Do it!

634
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:29,090
<i>You're dying to see me, aren't you?</i>

635
00:58:30,175 --> 00:58:35,095
<i>You may be too young to know,
but love grows through hardships.</i>

636
00:58:35,096 --> 00:58:36,928
What's she saying?

637
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:39,931
- Stop!
- Joon-kyung!

638
00:58:39,932 --> 00:58:43,771
<i>Still, if you're dying to see me,</i>

639
00:58:43,772 --> 00:58:45,729
you can go ahead and cry.

640
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:48,485
Don't fight the tears.
It'll make it worse.

641
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:57,118
Listen to the songs I recorded
and remember our first kiss...

642
00:58:57,702 --> 00:58:58,702
We didn't.

643
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:02,578
Is she out of her mind?

644
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:03,624
Move!

645
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:07,796
<i>Remembering our first
kiss will make you feel better.</i>

646
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:10,130
<i>Okay?</i>

647
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:16,677
<i>What else was there to say?</i>

648
00:59:18,887 --> 00:59:21,474
<i>I'll end it with a warning.</i>

649
00:59:22,435 --> 00:59:24,020
<i>If you don't want to die, write back.</i>

650
00:59:45,914 --> 00:59:46,914
Move over!

651
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,103
<i>Joon-kyung!</i>

652
01:00:11,484 --> 01:00:12,440
Grandpa!

653
01:00:12,441 --> 01:00:13,233
I'm coming.

654
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:14,571
Let's go!

655
01:00:18,739 --> 01:00:19,739
Need some help?

656
01:00:29,502 --> 01:00:32,088
Move, please!

657
01:00:33,882 --> 01:00:36,593
- Stomp on it hard.
- I am!

658
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:01,365
Why won't it work?

659
01:01:12,877 --> 01:01:13,877
Leave.

660
01:01:14,923 --> 01:01:15,923
What?

661
01:01:16,757 --> 01:01:18,507
Get out. I have to record.

662
01:01:28,353 --> 01:01:29,353
Rude twerp!

663
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:31,895
Are you nuts!

664
01:01:37,734 --> 01:01:38,734
Dear La-hee.

665
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:41,657
Hi, there.

666
01:01:41,658 --> 01:01:42,739
That's lame.

667
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,283
To La-hee.

668
01:01:47,284 --> 01:01:48,329
Dang...

669
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:51,960
How's Seoul and...

670
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:59,131
TO LA-HEE

671
01:02:00,677 --> 01:02:03,552
Calling this Wongok Station?

672
01:02:04,052 --> 01:02:09,266
I thought so, but Joon-kyung said
there's another station by that name.

673
01:02:12,397 --> 01:02:13,814
How about Yangwon Station?

674
01:02:15,692 --> 01:02:19,110
It's called Wongok here and there, too.

675
01:02:19,111 --> 01:02:22,531
So how about Yangwon?

676
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:25,325
YANGWON

677
01:02:25,326 --> 01:02:27,495
Careful! You'll break it!

678
01:02:27,496 --> 01:02:29,121
- Just hold still.
- Okay.

679
01:02:52,228 --> 01:02:56,064
- Hurray!
- Hurray!

680
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,819
RECIPIENT

681
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:10,787
SENDER: SONG LA-HEE

682
01:03:15,207 --> 01:03:15,791
CHIEF OF PR DEPARTMENT

683
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,753
National Railroad PR department?

684
01:03:17,754 --> 01:03:21,882
We publish a monthly
magazine for marketing.

685
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:27,344
We'd like to run your story in it.

686
01:03:29,558 --> 01:03:30,558
Me?

687
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:32,392
Why?

688
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:33,561
I heard about

689
01:03:33,562 --> 01:03:36,852
how you built Yangwon
Station with the villagers.

690
01:03:36,853 --> 01:03:40,693
Your principal complimented
on how hard you worked on it.

691
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:43,987
How about it?

692
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:46,363
I think it'll be interesting
and meaningful.

693
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:02,546
What are you doing?

694
01:04:03,964 --> 01:04:05,594
Why are you there?

695
01:04:07,175 --> 01:04:08,220
Why would you come?

696
01:04:09,806 --> 01:04:10,806
That's it?

697
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:12,389
Huh?

698
01:04:12,889 --> 01:04:15,476
That all you say to your
muse when it's been so long?

699
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,026
Ah... How've you been?

700
01:04:23,191 --> 01:04:24,444
Come on.

701
01:04:24,445 --> 01:04:25,738
My legs are killing me.

702
01:04:27,279 --> 01:04:29,534
How'd he walk this every day?

703
01:04:41,001 --> 01:04:41,545
Step aside.

704
01:04:41,546 --> 01:04:42,711
It's Gwang-su, right?

705
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:48,925
What are you looking at?

706
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:51,847
- Your sister is so pretty.
- What?

707
01:04:51,848 --> 01:04:53,558
Gwang-su has good sense.

708
01:04:54,851 --> 01:04:57,060
You call that pretty?

709
01:04:57,061 --> 01:04:59,687
She looks like a half-eaten dumpling.

710
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:00,520
Wanna die!

711
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:02,065
She looks way better than you.

712
01:05:02,066 --> 01:05:03,190
No way.

713
01:05:03,191 --> 01:05:05,193
Wow! You made all this?

714
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:10,446
The village ladies always
bring me side dishes.

715
01:05:10,447 --> 01:05:12,240
- What about the soup?
- I made it.

716
01:05:13,201 --> 01:05:14,202
Eat up.

717
01:05:15,452 --> 01:05:17,538
Shouldn't we wait for
your sister to come?

718
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:22,879
Don't worry. Just eat.

719
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:36,392
You pass on cooking too.

720
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:39,227
What do you mean?

721
01:05:40,312 --> 01:05:41,730
You know what I mean.

722
01:05:45,982 --> 01:05:48,821
Gwang-su is so cute even when she eats.

723
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:52,656
I heard you made the way station.

724
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:56,493
It's all ready for the
opening ceremony.

725
01:05:57,706 --> 01:05:59,207
How will that be done?

726
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:01,498
A train will have to stop, I guess.

727
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:03,876
What crazy timing.

728
01:06:04,753 --> 01:06:05,838
What do you mean?

729
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:08,132
Didn't the physics teacher tell you?

730
01:06:12,092 --> 01:06:13,092
Let's just eat.

731
01:06:13,846 --> 01:06:16,932
It's a chance to study
for free in America.

732
01:06:16,933 --> 01:06:19,058
Just eat and stop talking.

733
01:06:19,059 --> 01:06:22,185
If you do well, you
can even go to NASA!

734
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:24,439
That's always been a dream of yours!

735
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,983
This is good. Try it.

736
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:30,738
You'll pass it up again?

737
01:06:30,739 --> 01:06:33,698
- It's better than a science high...
- Just eat!

738
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:38,619
What's with you?

739
01:06:40,456 --> 01:06:41,830
You're so talkative.

740
01:06:51,676 --> 01:06:58,013
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

741
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:01,809
<i>Happy birthday dear Joon-kyung</i>

742
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:04,396
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

743
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:14,738
Eat quickly. I'll take you back.

744
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:15,740
I'm sleeping over.

745
01:07:19,287 --> 01:07:20,368
Are you gay?

746
01:07:23,872 --> 01:07:25,293
Are you crazy?

747
01:07:25,794 --> 01:07:27,250
Then how do you explain this?

748
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:28,504
Explain what?

749
01:07:29,586 --> 01:07:30,671
Must be gay.

750
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:39,387
Let's get going.

751
01:07:53,946 --> 01:07:55,447
Didn't you miss me?

752
01:07:57,698 --> 01:07:58,951
Why didn't you reply?

753
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:01,618
I was going to.

754
01:08:02,538 --> 01:08:04,789
Really? Then why didn't you?

755
01:08:10,338 --> 01:08:11,628
I don't know your address.

756
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,094
Oh, right.

757
01:08:29,273 --> 01:08:30,859
MUSE

758
01:08:35,363 --> 01:08:37,738
Don't forget the area code.

759
01:09:26,955 --> 01:09:28,080
Why'd you stop?

760
01:10:07,243 --> 01:10:08,328
I wish

761
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:12,208
you could fly high like that.

762
01:10:13,501 --> 01:10:15,503
Then my dream will come true too.

763
01:10:54,082 --> 01:10:55,459
<i>It won't be easy.</i>

764
01:10:56,752 --> 01:11:01,926
I bet Korea's best in math
and science will apply.

765
01:11:03,511 --> 01:11:07,015
High school and college
students can all apply.

766
01:11:07,595 --> 01:11:08,015
EXAM ID

767
01:11:08,016 --> 01:11:12,476
It'll be much harder
than a math competition.

768
01:11:15,023 --> 01:11:18,526
Then how can I stand a chance?

769
01:11:19,151 --> 01:11:21,569
Why? Have confidence!

770
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:51,307
It's so nice of her to come
out here for your birthday.

771
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:53,725
Nice?

772
01:11:58,482 --> 01:12:02,357
You know what? You're
older than me now.

773
01:12:02,358 --> 01:12:03,860
What are you talking about?

774
01:12:05,073 --> 01:12:07,154
You'll always be my older sister.

775
01:12:07,155 --> 01:12:09,492
Don't want to be an older brother?

776
01:12:09,493 --> 01:12:12,660
Cut the nonsense.

777
01:12:15,415 --> 01:12:16,708
I'm your younger brother.

778
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:27,175
How long do you think
I can stay with you?

779
01:12:32,764 --> 01:12:38,979
For your own good, I think
about leaving all the time.

780
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:42,650
But do you know why I'm still here?

781
01:12:48,905 --> 01:12:56,905
I want you to smile and
say, 'I gotta leave now.'

782
01:13:01,209 --> 01:13:02,754
I've been waiting all this time.

783
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:16,644
How about it? Can you do that for me?

784
01:13:23,151 --> 01:13:24,151
Come on!

785
01:13:27,195 --> 01:13:30,198
When the train stops, turn around.

786
01:13:32,368 --> 01:13:33,409
Get ready!

787
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:58,058
- What?
- Why didn't it stop?

788
01:14:15,491 --> 01:14:18,870
The villagers are fuming over
you not stopping at the station.

789
01:14:20,248 --> 01:14:21,997
I just drove to code.

790
01:14:21,998 --> 01:14:24,628
I guess we don't have any power.

791
01:14:25,837 --> 01:14:26,837
By the way...

792
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:31,134
Look.

793
01:14:31,135 --> 01:14:32,220
Isn't this Joon-kyung?

794
01:14:35,347 --> 01:14:38,306
BOY DREAMING OF SPACE
BUILDS A WAY STATION

795
01:14:45,521 --> 01:14:46,565
PR department.

796
01:14:46,566 --> 01:14:48,900
<i>How can you ruin my son's
life with an article like that!</i>

797
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,404
Please calm down, sir.

798
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:55,282
What exactly are you referring to?

799
01:14:55,283 --> 01:14:56,491
<i>Listen up!</i>

800
01:14:56,492 --> 01:15:01,204
Retrieve all the magazines
and correct the wrong parts!

801
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:02,582
I understand, sir.

802
01:15:03,415 --> 01:15:05,668
Could you explain
which parts are incorrect?

803
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:07,671
Why is it his fault that
his mom and sister died!

804
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:11,258
His mom couldn't go to the
hospital because there was no train!

805
01:15:11,259 --> 01:15:13,340
His sister fell off a
bridge to avoid a train!

806
01:15:13,341 --> 01:15:14,550
It's not his fault!

807
01:15:15,551 --> 01:15:17,389
It's because the train didn't stop!

808
01:15:17,929 --> 01:15:19,682
<i>What if he reads this!</i>

809
01:15:19,683 --> 01:15:21,516
<i>He'll think it's his fault they died!</i>

810
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:26,521
Did you stop to think how
much that will hurt the boy?

811
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,940
You're Joon-kyung's father, right?

812
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:31,566
There must be a misunderstanding, sir.

813
01:15:31,567 --> 01:15:33,197
What misunderstanding!

814
01:15:34,738 --> 01:15:35,738
Mr. JUNG.

815
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:40,288
About his mother and sister
passing away because of him,

816
01:15:40,952 --> 01:15:42,954
it's not something we made up, sir.

817
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:46,794
Joon-kyung said that himself.

818
01:15:49,377 --> 01:15:51,130
<i>Do you know</i>

819
01:15:51,131 --> 01:15:56,384
<i>why he wanted to make the station
so badly ever since he was young?</i>

820
01:15:57,261 --> 01:16:01,389
I don't think you know the real reason.

821
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:07,979
YANGWON STATION GRAND OPENING

822
01:16:14,738 --> 01:16:16,071
Running away?

823
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:23,787
You're running away again?

824
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:27,583
I give up.

825
01:16:28,252 --> 01:16:29,252
You stupid!

826
01:16:30,462 --> 01:16:33,921
All that's left is for trains to
stop here, but you'll give up?

827
01:16:34,966 --> 01:16:36,675
You don't know.

828
01:16:36,676 --> 01:16:37,885
Don't know what?

829
01:16:42,974 --> 01:16:44,059
Why...

830
01:16:49,645 --> 01:16:56,488
Why I wanted to make
Yangwon Station so much.

831
01:17:01,493 --> 01:17:03,495
Because I wanted Dad to compliment me.

832
01:17:09,793 --> 01:17:11,335
And then...

833
01:17:15,883 --> 01:17:17,549
I wanted his forgiveness.

834
01:17:21,177 --> 01:17:23,179
Mom died giving birth to me.

835
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:26,558
And you fell because of me.

836
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:31,062
But if I made the station,

837
01:17:32,772 --> 01:17:34,774
I thought he'd notice

838
01:17:36,276 --> 01:17:39,407
and say that I did a good job.

839
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:43,034
Not once...

840
01:17:44,244 --> 01:17:46,246
I haven't resented Dad once.

841
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,835
I was scared to see
him not looking at me,

842
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:57,841
so I avoided him first.

843
01:18:01,345 --> 01:18:04,512
It's not your fault. Why
seek Dad's forgiveness?

844
01:18:05,056 --> 01:18:07,434
Stop saying what happened
to Mom and me is your fault!

845
01:18:07,435 --> 01:18:09,225
If it wasn't for me,

846
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:17,024
you'd be living happy with Mom and Dad!

847
01:18:23,074 --> 01:18:27,995
You're still acting like
the scared little crybaby.

848
01:18:30,121 --> 01:18:32,539
You don't want to be forgiven by Dad.

849
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:33,961
You're just a coward.

850
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:37,964
It's an excuse not to do things
because you're scared of failing.

851
01:18:37,965 --> 01:18:38,965
Try?

852
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:41,925
How can you say that?

853
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:46,554
I tried to be happy!

854
01:18:47,763 --> 01:18:52,520
But no matter how I
try, bad things happen!

855
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:55,230
Why would I want to try?

856
01:18:55,855 --> 01:19:00,066
It's easier to think that it
wasn't meant to be for me!

857
01:19:00,067 --> 01:19:03,070
Did you think Yangwon Station
could be made from the start?

858
01:19:04,071 --> 01:19:05,700
Everyone said it's impossible!

859
01:19:05,701 --> 01:19:08,202
You didn't even think it'd
be made so nicely like this!

860
01:19:08,203 --> 01:19:09,203
What?

861
01:19:10,914 --> 01:19:12,039
Nice?

862
01:19:14,165 --> 01:19:16,167
Think Yangwon Station looks nice?

863
01:19:18,922 --> 01:19:22,048
The entire village got
together to build this station,

864
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:23,173
but trains won't stop!

865
01:19:23,174 --> 01:19:24,676
Call that a station?

866
01:19:29,389 --> 01:19:31,018
That's the story of my life.

867
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:36,312
When it wasn't built, at least
it didn't make me this mad!

868
01:19:39,943 --> 01:19:41,569
Stupid twerp!

869
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:02,233
IN MEMORY OF JUNG BO-KYUNG

870
01:21:27,342 --> 01:21:30,554
Where were you off to?

871
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:33,512
Joon-kyung's teacher is here.

872
01:21:33,513 --> 01:21:34,513
Hello.

873
01:21:34,974 --> 01:21:39,934
Hello, Mr. JUNG. I'm
Joon-kyung's physics teacher.

874
01:21:39,935 --> 01:21:43,358
What brings you here Mr. KIM?

875
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:54,285
<i>There's an important exam
that Joon-kyung must take.</i>

876
01:21:54,786 --> 01:21:58,289
If you'll allow me, I'll
take him to Seoul myself.

877
01:21:58,998 --> 01:22:02,000
What test is it that
he has to go to Seoul?

878
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:07,838
It's a government sponsored program
for the top student to study in America

879
01:22:07,839 --> 01:22:10,965
with the chance to
train at NASA as well.

880
01:22:10,966 --> 01:22:12,679
There's no time, sir.

881
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:15,931
We must leave now
to get there by 9 A.M.

882
01:22:22,562 --> 01:22:26,650
Korea's top student? Can he do it?

883
01:22:35,202 --> 01:22:38,870
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next stop is...

884
01:22:40,496 --> 01:22:44,251
Seungbu Station.
We'll stop for 1 minute.

885
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:58,096
<i>Mr. JUNG.</i>

886
01:22:58,097 --> 01:23:00,099
Joon-kyung is a genius.

887
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:05,565
Letting his talent go to waste
is a great sin to humanity.

888
01:23:06,441 --> 01:23:08,568
Never mind that, sir.

889
01:23:10,237 --> 01:23:16,199
This has been Joon-kyung's
dream for a long time.

890
01:23:18,245 --> 01:23:20,996
But he thinks he's not
entitled to dream and won't go.

891
01:23:22,914 --> 01:23:24,916
Will you watch him miss his chance?

892
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:43,349
Correction. Correction.

893
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:46,689
Next stop is Yangwon Station.

894
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:51,942
I repeat. Next stop is Yangwon Station.

895
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:53,028
We'll stop for...

896
01:23:57,284 --> 01:23:58,365
10 minutes.

897
01:24:00,660 --> 01:24:01,660
Sir!

898
01:24:02,998 --> 01:24:04,331
What are you doing?

899
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,332
Let go!

900
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:08,082
- You'll get in trouble!
- Let go!

901
01:24:08,083 --> 01:24:10,877
What are you thinking!

902
01:24:10,878 --> 01:24:12,299
Sir!

903
01:24:13,132 --> 01:24:15,049
It's against the code!

904
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,219
The hell with the code!

905
01:24:20,932 --> 01:24:22,517
My son...

906
01:24:26,229 --> 01:24:27,895
My poor son...

907
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:36,740
This is the only thing
I can do for his dream.

908
01:24:38,241 --> 01:24:39,827
I have to do this.

909
01:24:56,423 --> 01:24:57,844
What are you doing!

910
01:24:57,845 --> 01:24:59,386
Get ready to go to Seoul now!

911
01:25:04,559 --> 01:25:06,561
Come on! Let's go!

912
01:25:08,395 --> 01:25:09,644
Forget it.

913
01:25:09,645 --> 01:25:11,065
It's too late.

914
01:25:11,066 --> 01:25:12,315
You can still make it!

915
01:25:14,862 --> 01:25:16,422
The train is waiting
at Yangwon Station!

916
01:25:22,786 --> 01:25:23,786
Get ready!

917
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:32,418
I lost my exam ID.

918
01:25:32,419 --> 01:25:33,921
<i>It's here!</i>

919
01:25:46,141 --> 01:25:47,433
Sis…

920
01:25:47,434 --> 01:25:49,729
Must you always make things so hard?

921
01:26:01,697 --> 01:26:02,826
Look at you.

922
01:26:09,705 --> 01:26:11,418
You won't be mad even if I fail?

923
01:26:11,999 --> 01:26:14,629
All I wanted was for you to try.

924
01:26:18,589 --> 01:26:19,966
<i>What do you mean?</i>

925
01:26:19,967 --> 01:26:22,469
If you fail, don't
think of coming back!

926
01:26:36,399 --> 01:26:38,484
<i>Sir! Hurry!</i>

927
01:26:38,485 --> 01:26:43,406
Joon-kyung! Come on!

928
01:27:14,814 --> 01:27:16,355
Over here!

929
01:27:25,116 --> 01:27:26,409
We'll be going…

930
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:28,703
I'll go.

931
01:27:30,077 --> 01:27:31,286
What?

932
01:27:39,586 --> 01:27:42,049
Get some sleep before the test.

933
01:27:44,467 --> 01:27:46,553
Aren't you sleepy?

934
01:27:48,223 --> 01:27:49,764
No.

935
01:27:50,473 --> 01:27:51,807
Get some rest.

936
01:28:03,238 --> 01:28:04,363
What are you doing?

937
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:07,113
I can't sleep sitting up.

938
01:28:07,114 --> 01:28:10,284
Why you little!

939
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:15,081
Turn the handle on
the side of the seat.

940
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:16,206
Go on.

941
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:20,462
You didn't know?

942
01:28:20,463 --> 01:28:21,756
Where?

943
01:28:26,133 --> 01:28:28,387
Is this right?

944
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:30,557
The other way!

945
01:28:31,058 --> 01:28:35,809
What in the world!

946
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,312
This is cool.

947
01:28:54,369 --> 01:28:55,369
What's Seoul like?

948
01:28:58,417 --> 01:28:59,502
What?

949
01:29:00,459 --> 01:29:01,836
What does Seoul look like?

950
01:29:04,799 --> 01:29:05,840
How would I know?

951
01:29:09,428 --> 01:29:12,515
What? You've never been there?

952
01:29:14,601 --> 01:29:16,603
Of course I haven't.

953
01:29:18,561 --> 01:29:20,107
It's your first time going?

954
01:29:21,024 --> 01:29:23,025
- Turn left.
- Oh no!

955
01:29:23,026 --> 01:29:24,274
Go left!

956
01:29:24,275 --> 01:29:28,695
- Why didn't you tell me sooner!
- How am I supposed to know!

957
01:29:29,616 --> 01:29:30,989
Drive slowly!

958
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:32,407
You don't have much time left!

959
01:29:34,037 --> 01:29:36,663
- Turn the car around!
- Which way?

960
01:29:40,916 --> 01:29:43,963
Maybe I'm wrong…

961
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:49,051
Stupid! You can't even read a map!

962
01:29:49,052 --> 01:29:51,177
Just watch the road, Dad!

963
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:53,348
Dang! There's no time!

964
01:29:54,057 --> 01:29:56,059
Why'd you say you'll drive!

965
01:29:57,768 --> 01:29:59,770
Mr. KIM was going to drive me!

966
01:30:00,435 --> 01:30:01,520
Jeez.

967
01:30:11,738 --> 01:30:12,823
We're late.

968
01:30:16,996 --> 01:30:19,414
What? Where are you going?

969
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:24,379
What are you doing?

970
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:26,088
The exam started!

971
01:30:26,089 --> 01:30:27,089
What's he doing?

972
01:30:27,382 --> 01:30:29,383
Hurry! Go inside!

973
01:30:29,384 --> 01:30:30,884
You can't go in!

974
01:30:30,885 --> 01:30:31,967
Hurry!

975
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:35,137
You can't go in now!

976
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:36,470
Hurry up!

977
01:30:36,471 --> 01:30:38,017
Wait!

978
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:44,691
You can do it!

979
01:31:46,917 --> 01:31:49,543
<i>Then it rises.</i>

980
01:31:49,544 --> 01:31:52,631
<i>That's the basics of acceleration.</i>

981
01:31:55,802 --> 01:31:58,345
Let's turn to the next chapter.

982
01:32:00,891 --> 01:32:02,557
A letter for JUNG Joon-kyung!

983
01:32:06,189 --> 01:32:07,854
KOREA ASTROPHYSICS ASSOCIATION

984
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:08,959
Boy, don't cry over
something like that!

985
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,296
Your life is not over
because you failed one exam!

986
01:33:21,348 --> 01:33:23,681
He did it!

987
01:33:23,682 --> 01:33:31,646
Joon-kyung placed first in Korea
and will be going to America!

988
01:33:44,203 --> 01:33:45,996
MUSE

989
01:33:49,584 --> 01:33:50,877
What's all this?

990
01:33:57,672 --> 01:33:58,672
Take it.

991
01:33:59,594 --> 01:34:00,758
I can't drink.

992
01:34:00,759 --> 01:34:02,261
You gotta learn to drink from Dad.

993
01:34:14,525 --> 01:34:15,525
Cheers!

994
01:34:16,735 --> 01:34:17,735
Use both hands.

995
01:34:24,699 --> 01:34:25,783
Kid.

996
01:34:25,784 --> 01:34:28,539
When you drink with
an elder, you gotta turn.

997
01:34:36,002 --> 01:34:39,842
Your body! Turn to the side like this!

998
01:34:40,507 --> 01:34:43,218
How did you place first in Korea?

999
01:35:05,159 --> 01:35:09,872
Have a good look
before you go to America.

1000
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:19,506
I'll miss you.

1001
01:35:20,755 --> 01:35:23,886
Don't go soft on me like a girl.

1002
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:30,849
We lived apart here too.
Why would you miss me?

1003
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:32,727
I meant the moon.

1004
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:34,481
I can't see that in America.

1005
01:35:48,202 --> 01:35:49,368
I'm sorry.

1006
01:35:53,788 --> 01:35:54,788
About what?

1007
01:35:56,791 --> 01:35:59,962
Do you know why…

1008
01:36:03,382 --> 01:36:06,385
I never went to school
ceremonies for you and Bo-kyung?

1009
01:36:12,266 --> 01:36:13,768
I felt sorry to your mom.

1010
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:22,609
Seeing them when she
couldn't, I felt so sorry to her.

1011
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:29,784
Think about it.

1012
01:36:32,078 --> 01:36:37,167
Why do you think I felt
so sorry to your mom?

1013
01:36:41,756 --> 01:36:43,089
All my life,

1014
01:36:46,509 --> 01:36:53,267
I regret exactly two things.

1015
01:37:04,695 --> 01:37:06,236
Daddy…

1016
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:12,242
<i>Sticking to the job
and not running home.</i>

1017
01:37:14,204 --> 01:37:20,166
If I came home as soon
as your mom went into labor,

1018
01:37:22,212 --> 01:37:23,378
your mom…

1019
01:37:26,381 --> 01:37:28,174
She could've made it.

1020
01:37:37,311 --> 01:37:38,311
And…

1021
01:37:41,688 --> 01:37:42,897
The other things is…

1022
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:54,953
When you placed first in grade 4.

1023
01:38:00,543 --> 01:38:02,793
I didn't go to see you get your prize.

1024
01:38:08,759 --> 01:38:10,761
I regret that for life.

1025
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:14,557
I'm working. How can I go?

1026
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,892
It's no big deal. Relax.

1027
01:38:19,101 --> 01:38:20,935
Just take your brother and go.

1028
01:38:21,728 --> 01:38:22,813
I'm busy.

1029
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:28,110
I'll run your shift. Why won't you go?

1030
01:38:28,987 --> 01:38:30,697
He won the math contest.

1031
01:38:31,614 --> 01:38:34,533
Go home and celebrate
with some fried chicken.

1032
01:38:35,578 --> 01:38:37,035
Forget it.

1033
01:38:39,121 --> 01:38:41,123
You're always so stubborn.

1034
01:39:09,235 --> 01:39:11,530
FAMILY FRIED CHICKEN

1035
01:39:12,446 --> 01:39:13,446
Tae-yoon.

1036
01:39:15,490 --> 01:39:16,490
What is it?

1037
01:39:17,784 --> 01:39:19,037
Bo-kyung…

1038
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:21,955
What?

1039
01:39:23,417 --> 01:39:24,959
What about Bo-kyung?

1040
01:39:30,505 --> 01:39:31,674
There's been an accident.

1041
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:38,641
Is she hurt? How badly?

1042
01:39:39,598 --> 01:39:43,601
She's gone missing into the river.

1043
01:39:43,602 --> 01:39:46,019
What? Where?

1044
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:48,357
By the third tunnel into Wongok.

1045
01:39:48,358 --> 01:39:50,152
She fell off the bridge.

1046
01:39:51,025 --> 01:39:52,109
Let go!

1047
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:54,195
I was the one who drove. Got that?

1048
01:39:54,196 --> 01:39:57,322
Who cares about that now!

1049
01:39:57,323 --> 01:40:00,246
Snap to it! You gotta
be there for Joon-kyung!

1050
01:40:01,203 --> 01:40:03,666
Want him to resent you for life?

1051
01:40:08,210 --> 01:40:09,796
What are you talking about?

1052
01:40:13,423 --> 01:40:14,823
She fell trying to avoid the train.

1053
01:40:16,342 --> 01:40:17,552
Freight train 37.

1054
01:40:43,954 --> 01:40:45,371
Let go.

1055
01:40:47,457 --> 01:40:50,167
Let me go.

1056
01:40:50,168 --> 01:40:51,629
Bo-kyung!

1057
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:53,046
Bo-kyung!

1058
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:55,424
- Let me go!
- Stop!

1059
01:40:55,425 --> 01:40:59,052
- Let go of me!
- Tae-yoon!

1060
01:40:59,053 --> 01:41:00,053
Let go!

1061
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:01,054
Stop!

1062
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:02,680
Tae-yoon!

1063
01:41:02,681 --> 01:41:04,141
Focus!

1064
01:41:04,142 --> 01:41:05,891
Listen to me.

1065
01:41:05,892 --> 01:41:07,686
I'm the one who drove that train.

1066
01:41:09,187 --> 01:41:12,899
Keep it a secret for life. Got that?

1067
01:41:18,156 --> 01:41:19,698
Just think of Joon-kyung.

1068
01:41:20,615 --> 01:41:24,038
You gotta live and move on.

1069
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:43,305
Why I couldn't look at you…

1070
01:41:47,185 --> 01:41:48,771
Get it now?

1071
01:42:00,406 --> 01:42:01,615
You see…

1072
01:42:06,661 --> 01:42:08,122
Ah…

1073
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:15,545
Losing the ones I love like that…

1074
01:42:21,511 --> 01:42:22,889
Well…

1075
01:42:26,765 --> 01:42:28,767
With you…

1076
01:42:32,186 --> 01:42:33,399
I…

1077
01:42:37,611 --> 01:42:40,278
I had to hide my love for you.

1078
01:42:44,743 --> 01:42:45,952
If not,

1079
01:42:47,453 --> 01:42:48,995
I thought I'd lose you too.

1080
01:42:55,209 --> 01:42:56,630
I was so scared.

1081
01:43:01,716 --> 01:43:04,178
I was scared, so I kept my distance.

1082
01:43:10,977 --> 01:43:12,978
Why mention that now?

1083
01:43:12,979 --> 01:43:14,356
Silly!

1084
01:43:16,358 --> 01:43:18,108
Stop blaming yourself!

1085
01:43:20,446 --> 01:43:23,738
You didn't do anything wrong
and have no reason to be sorry.

1086
01:43:27,786 --> 01:43:33,792
I wanted to tell you that,
so you'd stop hating yourself.

1087
01:43:42,676 --> 01:43:43,677
Okay.

1088
01:43:46,761 --> 01:43:48,014
I get it.

1089
01:43:51,641 --> 01:43:53,267
I won't hate myself anymore.

1090
01:43:58,484 --> 01:43:59,733
So promise me

1091
01:44:05,323 --> 01:44:06,993
that you won't hate yourself.

1092
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:11,369
Okay.

1093
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:18,084
Dad.

1094
01:44:21,087 --> 01:44:22,797
Back then…

1095
01:44:30,264 --> 01:44:32,266
Thanks for not dying in the river.

1096
01:44:33,435 --> 01:44:34,520
<i>Sis!</i>

1097
01:44:36,478 --> 01:44:37,523
<i>Where are you?</i>

1098
01:44:47,321 --> 01:44:48,321
What?

1099
01:44:51,117 --> 01:44:52,618
How did you know?

1100
01:44:55,665 --> 01:44:56,750
Bo-kyung…

1101
01:45:04,090 --> 01:45:05,840
She told me in my dream.

1102
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:23,000
CONGRATULATIONS JUNG JOON-KYUNG!

1103
01:46:23,001 --> 01:46:24,837
<i>Look at the camera!</i>

1104
01:46:24,838 --> 01:46:26,132
Everyone ready?

1105
01:46:27,173 --> 01:46:28,173
One!

1106
01:46:29,423 --> 01:46:30,592
Two!

1107
01:46:31,593 --> 01:46:32,593
Three!

1108
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:11,093
Thank you.

1109
01:47:13,343 --> 01:47:14,343
For what?

1110
01:47:15,305 --> 01:47:16,721
It's all thanks to you.

1111
01:47:16,722 --> 01:47:20,265
No, it's all because you worked hard.

1112
01:47:20,266 --> 01:47:21,311
No.

1113
01:47:24,062 --> 01:47:31,737
If it wasn't for you and
Dad, I wouldn't have made it.

1114
01:47:33,779 --> 01:47:34,824
Really?

1115
01:47:37,783 --> 01:47:38,868
Swear to god.

1116
01:47:44,918 --> 01:47:47,793
What about Gwang-su? Why leave her out?

1117
01:47:50,424 --> 01:47:51,424
Right.

1118
01:48:08,066 --> 01:48:09,523
I'll do my best…

1119
01:48:15,029 --> 01:48:16,450
You'll keep watching, right?

1120
01:48:19,701 --> 01:48:20,870
Of course.

1121
01:48:37,971 --> 01:48:38,971
Sis…

1122
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:48,354
I gotta leave now.

1123
01:48:54,568 --> 01:48:55,568
Good.

1124
01:48:57,071 --> 01:48:58,324
My little brother…

1125
01:49:03,121 --> 01:49:04,330
Have a good trip.

1126
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:20,554
Take care.

1127
01:49:50,292 --> 01:49:52,462
MUSE

1128
01:50:20,282 --> 01:50:21,699
<i>JUNG Joon-kyung!</i>

1129
01:50:26,204 --> 01:50:28,206
Wait! Open the door!

1130
01:50:33,751 --> 01:50:34,667
You can't come back out.

1131
01:50:34,668 --> 01:50:35,212
Wait.

1132
01:50:35,213 --> 01:50:36,962
- You can't come out.
- Wait.

1133
01:51:01,154 --> 01:51:02,532
What was that for?

1134
01:51:03,032 --> 01:51:04,697
How can you leave without calling?

1135
01:51:04,698 --> 01:51:06,535
I did, but you didn't answer.

1136
01:51:06,536 --> 01:51:07,536
When?

1137
01:51:09,871 --> 01:51:10,871
Just now.

1138
01:51:12,125 --> 01:51:14,127
How can you go without seeing me!

1139
01:51:26,348 --> 01:51:27,348
Get up.

1140
01:51:34,312 --> 01:51:35,521
You'll write, right?

1141
01:51:37,315 --> 01:51:38,315
Of course.

1142
01:51:38,984 --> 01:51:41,194
Don't look at other girls.

1143
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:43,948
Eat well.

1144
01:51:43,949 --> 01:51:45,451
Don't get sick.

1145
01:51:46,240 --> 01:51:47,409
And…

1146
01:51:49,243 --> 01:51:51,120
Think only of me till I get…

1147
01:52:10,932 --> 01:52:16,897
<i>Korea's first private station,
Yangwon, closed in 2012 after 24 years.</i>

1148
01:52:16,898 --> 01:52:23,320
<i>In 2013, a tourist train
called 'Baekdu-daegan Gorge
Train', began stopping there.</i>

1149
01:52:23,321 --> 01:52:30,496
<i>New roads into the village were
also built for better commutes.</i>
