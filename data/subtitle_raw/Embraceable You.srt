00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,036
Thank you, nurse.

179
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:18,110
That bad?

180
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,930
I feel weak. Everything hurts.

181
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:24,535
No it doesn't, Marie.

182
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,558
I know when I hurt.
- I'm the doctor.

183
00:13:29,354 --> 00:13:30,340
Now listen to me.

184
00:13:31,148 --> 00:13:32,764
I understand what you're trying to do.

185
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:34,243
There is no use.

186
00:13:34,462 --> 00:13:35,878
There's nobody to collect from.

187
00:13:37,185 --> 00:13:39,772
Maybe if there were I'd stretch
a point and help you build it up.

188
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,538
But there isn't.

189
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,279
You really do feel better, don't you?

190
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:47,932
That's a good girl.

191
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:51,161
We're going to send you home soon.
Maybe the day after tomorrow.

192
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:53,085
Then everything will look different.

193
00:13:53,401 --> 00:13:54,127
Sure.

194
00:13:54,753 --> 00:13:56,283
Everything is going to be wonderful.

195
00:13:58,068 --> 00:13:59,803
But I haven't got any home.

196
00:14:01,171 --> 00:14:02,472
That's how it all happened.

197
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,996
They'd locked me out of my room.

198
00:14:07,406 --> 00:14:10,076
I was walking around
driving myself crazy.

199
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:13,137
Trying to think of a way to
get my hands on some money.

200
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:15,611
Come on, now.
Maybe we'll find your brother.

201
00:14:16,312 --> 00:14:17,879
Or something else will turn up.

202
00:14:18,246 --> 00:14:19,521
Not with my luck.

203
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,773
I haven't had a job in two months.

204
00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:26,838
Then it was dancing in some
crummy little dive in Brooklyn.

205
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:30,004
Then it folded and I didn't
get my last week's pay.

206
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:33,798
It's not fair.

207
00:14:34,392 --> 00:14:38,674
There was a girl at the Geddes theater
who broke her leg and got $5,000 for it.

208
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:42,955
I can't even have a good accident.

209
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:53,250
Eddie, please.
What's the matter with you?

210
00:14:53,723 --> 00:14:54,482
Nothing.

211
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:56,746
For the first time you are
hanging here all day long.

212
00:14:57,626 --> 00:15:00,232
There's no important business in
the pool room with the big-shots?

213
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:01,237
All quiet.

214
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:04,345
Sammy, you think the Greek down the
way can give me a break on some roses?

215
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,915
Oh .. a girl?

216
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:08,222
No, it isn't a girl.

217
00:15:09,413 --> 00:15:11,040
For boys he buys roses?

218
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:20,430
They're beautiful.

219
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,352
Goodbye, Miss Willens.
- Marie.

220
00:15:28,418 --> 00:15:29,152
Marie.

221
00:15:30,052 --> 00:15:30,920
Must you go?

222
00:15:31,554 --> 00:15:32,249
Yep.

223
00:15:34,552 --> 00:15:36,648
I've got some important
business to take care of.

224
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:41,916
I'm glad you're feeling better, Marie.
- Thanks.

225
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,776
Thanks for being so nice to me.

226
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:45,451
It's nothing.

227
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:46,787
I'm ..

228
00:15:47,726 --> 00:15:49,142
I'm glad you feel better, Marie.

229
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:50,932
You already said that.

230
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,019
Well.

231
00:15:55,402 --> 00:15:57,009
Goodbye, Mr Novok.
- Eddie.

232
00:15:58,163 --> 00:15:59,092
Goodbye, Eddie.

233
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:04,851
I'll be here until 4 o'clock tomorrow.

234
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:26,414
The doctor wants to see you.

235
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:28,905
Who, me?

236
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,015
You're Mr Novok, aren't you?
- Yeah but ..

237
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:32,483
Come right this way.

238
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:38,595
Go right in.

239
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,450
Hello, Mr Novok.

240
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:49,627
I'm Doctor Wirth.

241
00:16:53,627 --> 00:16:54,730
Have a cigarette.

242
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:02,291
Sit down.

243
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:09,655
I want to talk to you
about Miss Willens.

244
00:17:12,776 --> 00:17:14,678
You've no idea where we
can reach her brother?

245
00:17:16,582 --> 00:17:17,217
No.

246
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,968
I thought he was in Milwaukee.

247
00:17:23,394 --> 00:17:24,867
How well do you know Miss Willens?

248
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:26,280
I don't know her at all.

249
00:17:28,032 --> 00:17:29,033
I mean I ..

250
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,512
I thought I'd come to see
her because I knew Jerry.

251
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:34,658
That's her brother.

252
00:17:37,445 --> 00:17:38,718
I don't know him very well.

253
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:40,850
Why?

254
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:45,451
Because she is liable to die.

255
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:48,725
But I just saw her.

256
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,533
She's fine. She told me so.

257
00:17:51,824 --> 00:17:52,810
She doesn't know.

258
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:03,779
That's a mistake.

259
00:18:05,272 --> 00:18:07,796
She feels good. She looks good.
- I'm sorry. It's not a mistake.

260
00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:11,016
She has an aneurysm.
An inoperable aneurysm.

261
00:18:12,638 --> 00:18:13,481
What's that?

262
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:15,546
It's a blood tumour in an artery.

263
00:18:15,765 --> 00:18:17,993
Like a bruise inside.
Caused by the accident.

264
00:18:18,988 --> 00:18:20,346
She'll be alright for a while.

265
00:18:20,575 --> 00:18:23,195
Then, possibly in a month
or so a blood clot will form.

266
00:18:23,953 --> 00:18:25,254
When it reaches her heart ..

267
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,145
You're sending her home.

268
00:18:30,794 --> 00:18:33,473
She told me you're sending her home.
- That's why I wanted to talk to you.

269
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:35,961
I'd keep her here if I
could but it's impossible.

270
00:18:36,351 --> 00:18:37,801
And she has no place to go.

271
00:18:41,617 --> 00:18:43,752
I thought, since you're
her only friend ..

272
00:18:44,162 --> 00:18:45,435
You might want to help her.

273
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:48,751
Why me?

274
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:50,191
Why should I help her?

275
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,172
You can't put it on me.

276
00:18:53,982 --> 00:18:56,731
Sorry, Mr Novok. I asked you
because there was no-one else.

277
00:18:59,698 --> 00:19:00,346
Yeah.

278
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:02,964
Sure I understand. You had to ask me.

279
00:19:03,499 --> 00:19:05,773
We'll see what we can do with
one of the charitable agencies.

280
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,976
Did you ask any other doctors?

281
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:26,583
Did you take an X-Ray?

282
00:19:27,006 --> 00:19:27,849
Quite a few.

283
00:19:40,143 --> 00:19:41,166
Hello Eddie.

284
00:19:42,763 --> 00:19:44,054
Been waiting to see you.

285
00:19:46,331 --> 00:19:47,683
I want to ask you something.

286
00:19:49,082 --> 00:19:51,322
How does it feel to find out
that you're a murderer?

287
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:56,444
Maybe you know what you're
talking about but I don't.

288
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,132
I got no interest in finding out.
- Don't go.

289
00:20:00,373 --> 00:20:01,714
I got things to say to you.

290
00:20:03,124 --> 00:20:05,424
When I look at you I
get sick to my stomach.

291
00:20:06,101 --> 00:20:08,410
Everything you get,
you've been asking for.

292
00:20:09,265 --> 00:20:11,751
If you've something to say, say it.
Otherwise peddle it elsewhere.

293
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,513
I've been watching kids
like you all my life.

294
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:16,982
The same story. You're so smart.

295
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:20,415
Hanging around the big-shots.
Playing the angles.

296
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:23,534
Only thing is you never
figure out any good angles.

297
00:20:23,753 --> 00:20:25,475
You never get next to anyone really big.

298
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:28,656
Something like this happens
and you're a scared rabbit.

299
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:30,215
Praying for out.

300
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:31,598
I told you before.

301
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:33,965
I don't know what you're talking about.

302
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:35,732
When were you in Milwaukee?

303
00:20:39,378 --> 00:20:41,394
Is there any law that says I
had to be in Milwaukee?

304
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,012
There is no law about this.

305
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:49,233
You're in trouble, kid.

306
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,191
In trouble with the cops.

307
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:57,341
I can't take you in. I know
you hit her but I can't prove it.

308
00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:00,409
But I know what you and
Ketch did before you hit her.

309
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,282
What do you mean?

310
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,011
Read the evening papers.
You'll find out what trouble is.

311
00:21:11,785 --> 00:21:13,146
Where was I? Oh yes.

312
00:21:13,986 --> 00:21:16,322
I was telling you what I know.
What I can't prove.

313
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:17,804
Yet.

314
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,703
Now I'm going to tell you
what this adds up to.

315
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:23,000
It means you do what I
tell you the way I tell you.

316
00:21:23,618 --> 00:21:25,797
Otherwise I'll make you
my personal pigeon.

317
00:21:26,592 --> 00:21:29,905
If you walk down the street just once
without money in your pocket and no job.

318
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,547
I'll pick you up for vagrancy.

319
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:33,448
If you sit in on a game.

320
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,961
The game gets raided.

321
00:21:36,455 --> 00:21:39,786
If you put a slug in a telephone I'll
run you down like you robbed a bank.

322
00:21:41,502 --> 00:21:43,817
What do you want?
- The doctor told you, didn't he?

323
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:45,383
Yes.

324
00:21:45,602 --> 00:21:47,301
Did he tell you she has no place to go?

325
00:21:48,313 --> 00:21:49,676
Yeah.
- Get her a place.

326
00:21:50,212 --> 00:21:50,884
Sonny.

327
00:21:51,294 --> 00:21:52,210
Me?
- You.

328
00:21:53,487 --> 00:21:54,960
Take care of her. Treat her right.

329
00:21:55,492 --> 00:21:56,512
Buy her presents.

330
00:21:56,896 --> 00:21:58,713
See she has a little
fun before she dies.

331
00:21:59,967 --> 00:22:00,891
But I can't.

332
00:22:06,228 --> 00:22:07,126
How can I?

333
00:22:10,374 --> 00:22:12,027
I ain't got no dough.
- Get some.

334
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:13,436
You're a smart boy.

335
00:22:14,772 --> 00:22:15,930
Find yourself an angle.

336
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,478
Don't forget to read the evening papers.

337
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,115
Like I seem to have said
before, don't you knock?

338
00:22:40,382 --> 00:22:42,021
How do you feel?
- Swell.

339
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:43,345
You will.

340
00:22:44,422 --> 00:22:47,063
Your problems are all over, honey.
You're going to have a place to stay.

341
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:48,993
Eddie Novok is going
to take care of you.

342
00:22:49,777 --> 00:22:51,336
I don't get it.
- You don't have to.

343
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:53,579
Take all you can get.
You're entitled to it.

344
00:22:54,469 --> 00:22:55,796
Just don't be a dope, baby.

345
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:57,952
Not that I think you'll be a dope.

346
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,293
Why, Mr Ferris.

347
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:02,681
How you do go on.

348
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:11,309
Hey, Sammy. Two scoops.

349
00:23:11,587 --> 00:23:12,699
Yes, two scoops.

350
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:14,427
Did I ever cheat you?

351
00:23:15,755 --> 00:23:16,840
Money, money, money.

352
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:24,757
They were here. Asking for you.

353
00:23:25,199 --> 00:23:25,908
Who?

354
00:23:26,423 --> 00:23:27,381
The police were.

355
00:23:29,562 --> 00:23:32,171
What did you tell them?
- What could I tell them?

356
00:23:32,407 --> 00:23:34,227
What cream and sugar
you put in your coffee?

357
00:23:36,372 --> 00:23:37,416
You are in trouble.

358
00:23:40,194 --> 00:23:42,153
Nothing a couple of grand
wouldn't straighten out.

359
00:23:44,294 --> 00:23:45,280
Can you spare it?

360
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:51,424
Before I answer your proposition.

361
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:53,954
I should look up my financial holdings.

362
00:24:07,756 --> 00:24:08,348
Oh.

363
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,033
USD went down three points.

364
00:24:37,842 --> 00:24:38,514
Eddie.

365
00:24:48,126 --> 00:24:49,341
Hey, where are you going?

366
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:52,331
I want to see Ketch.

367
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,490
He ain't in.

368
00:24:53,865 --> 00:24:55,541
I've got to see him.
- He ain't in.

369
00:25:00,435 --> 00:25:01,381
Give me a beer.

370
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,858
I'll catch you later.

371
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:18,875
You said he wasn't in.

372
00:25:19,168 --> 00:25:20,904
Don't get yourself in an uproar.
He isn't.

373
00:25:21,598 --> 00:25:22,245
Yeah?

374
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,365
I'm going to wait.

375
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:27,464
Suit yourself, friend. It's your time.

376
00:25:27,732 --> 00:25:29,239
I'm getting myself a case of beer.

377
00:25:47,596 --> 00:25:48,241
Hi.

378
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,337
Hello Bernie.

379
00:25:55,998 --> 00:25:56,819
What plays?

380
00:25:58,411 --> 00:25:59,569
I got to talk to Ketch.

381
00:26:00,514 --> 00:26:02,157
I don't think he wants to see you.

382
00:26:02,495 --> 00:26:03,567
He got me into this.

383
00:26:04,132 --> 00:26:05,061
I'm in trouble.

384
00:26:05,462 --> 00:26:07,498
Right now, kid.
He has troubles of his own.

385
00:26:08,353 --> 00:26:10,176
He thinks you should
stay away from here.

386
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:11,699
But he has to help me.

387
00:26:12,376 --> 00:26:14,335
I need dough and the
cops are on my tail.

388
00:26:14,554 --> 00:26:16,602
He told me to tell you to stay away.

389
00:26:17,355 --> 00:26:19,643
He told me to make sure you stayed away.

390
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,784
You know Eddie, I like you.

391
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:24,847
But I'd do what he tells me.

392
00:26:27,985 --> 00:26:28,939
Be a good boy.

393
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:30,668
Don't make me trouble.

394
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:57,670
Alright, you hate it.
Now let's get down to business.

395
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,324
Who needs it? Who wants it?

396
00:27:00,424 --> 00:27:02,327
'Honest Peterson', it says.
'Will buy anything'.

397
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:05,379
You'd have to pay them to take it away.
You must have had it pushed in here.

398
00:27:06,748 --> 00:27:09,088
Six hundred and fifty.
- Six hundred and fifty?

399
00:27:09,737 --> 00:27:12,553
Who said you were crazy? It says:
'Get more money from Honest Peterson'.

400
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,169
I need new signs. I can't afford them.

401
00:27:15,562 --> 00:27:16,234
Seven.

402
00:27:16,508 --> 00:27:19,066
I gotta have more dough or I can't
do business. Come on, Peterson.

403
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:21,378
What am I running here,
a charity bazaar?

404
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:23,521
Seven fifty and I'm being good to you.

405
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,923
Nine.

406
00:27:25,361 --> 00:27:26,660
Drive it away.
- Eight.

407
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:27,972
Sign here.

408
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,574
Any messages?

409
00:27:47,553 --> 00:27:48,305
Well.

410
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,473
And what can I do for
you mister .. mister ..?

411
00:27:54,893 --> 00:27:55,566
Novok.

412
00:27:56,227 --> 00:27:57,299
I want an apartment.

413
00:27:57,661 --> 00:27:59,579
I don't have a single thing.
Not a thing.

414
00:28:00,404 --> 00:28:03,453
If you'd been here half an hour ago.
I took a young couple up to a place.

415
00:28:03,841 --> 00:28:06,334
Charming people. A dentist and his wife.
They snapped it right up.

416
00:28:06,773 --> 00:28:09,084
Look, skip the double talk.
I want an apartment today.

417
00:28:09,507 --> 00:28:10,491
This afternoon.

418
00:28:11,184 --> 00:28:12,847
I don't think I understand, Mr Novok.

419
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,340
Sure you do. I want an apartment
and I'm ready to pay for it.

420
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,137
That's a very bad philosophy, Mr Novok.

421
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:21,216
We don't do business that way.
We're not a fly-by-night concern.

422
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:24,927
We've been here at the
same old stand since 1945.

423
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:26,978
Well.

424
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:29,159
It just occurs to me.

425
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,369
There might just be ..

426
00:28:35,696 --> 00:28:37,686
Of course, this may not suit you.

427
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:38,867
How much?

428
00:28:39,376 --> 00:28:41,536
A yard and a half a month.
Three months in advance and ..

429
00:28:42,135 --> 00:28:44,426
Three hundred for the janitor.
That's seven-fifty.

430
00:28:53,294 --> 00:28:54,286
Wrap it up.

431
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,406
You're going to be very
happy there, Mr Novok.

432
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,628
Not as happy as the janitor.

433
00:29:32,158 --> 00:29:33,097
It's lovely.

434
00:29:44,392 --> 00:29:46,204
The best thing is the fireplace.

435
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:48,008
It works.

436
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:52,731
It winks.

437
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:01,375
Just think. If I hadn't had my
accident we never would have met.

438
00:30:04,905 --> 00:30:05,704
Yeah.

439
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:09,936
Here. I'd better give you
this and get out of here.

440
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:13,110
Aren't you going to show me around?

441
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,032
There are more rooms, aren't there?

442
00:30:15,418 --> 00:30:17,040
Sure. There's a kitchen, bedroom.

443
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:18,735
A kitchen and a bedroom?

444
00:30:19,245 --> 00:30:19,974
Come on.

445
00:30:20,275 --> 00:30:21,993
I insist on a complete tour.
- Hey.

446
00:30:22,644 --> 00:30:23,660
You ought to rest.

447
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,697
Yes, I should.

448
00:30:31,033 --> 00:30:32,451
But .. please.

449
00:30:49,484 --> 00:30:51,017
Eddie, it's stunning.

450
00:30:52,244 --> 00:30:53,602
I don't know how to thank you.

451
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:56,792
I'd better run along.

452
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:02,819
When are you coming back to see me?

453
00:31:04,327 --> 00:31:05,314
I'll drop around.

454
00:32:21,153 --> 00:32:22,015
Hello?

455
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:26,244
Who?

456
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:27,466
Marie.

457
00:32:27,951 --> 00:32:28,938
Marie Willens.

458
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:32,204
Don't you remember me
from the Spade Club?

459
00:32:32,613 --> 00:32:34,212
Yes. How are you, honey?

460
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,652
Where have you been?

461
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:37,148
Oh, around.

462
00:32:38,448 --> 00:32:39,778
Have I got stuff to tell you.

463
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:42,524
Tell me all. Who is he?

464
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:46,428
An apartment?

465
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:49,960
I don't get it.

466
00:32:50,306 --> 00:32:52,161
To tell you the truth, neither do I.

467
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:54,031
But it's gorgeous.

468
00:32:56,536 --> 00:32:59,145
Now if I could only get myself a job.

469
00:32:59,496 --> 00:33:00,948
Everything would be perfect.

470
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,048
I think something can
be done about that.

471
00:33:03,604 --> 00:33:05,142
I'm going to see my agent tomorrow.

472
00:33:05,506 --> 00:33:07,751
If you hear of anything,
will you call me?

473
00:33:08,748 --> 00:33:10,116
Sure, of course I will.

474
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:12,826
Give me your number.
We'll make a date anyway, huh?

475
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:16,977
2-2-6-2.

476
00:33:17,786 --> 00:33:18,429
Okay.

477
00:33:18,755 --> 00:33:19,370
Bye.

478
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:21,529
And don't trip over any
of those pink clouds.

479
00:33:21,935 --> 00:33:23,423
I won't. Goodbye.

480
00:33:36,503 --> 00:33:37,159
Yeah?

481
00:33:37,556 --> 00:33:38,772
<i>Miss Dennis is here</i>.

482
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,294
Send her in please.

483
00:33:45,336 --> 00:33:47,325
Don't forget, dear. A week from Tuesday.

484
00:33:47,736 --> 00:33:50,592
Alright, you character.
Don't forget your appointment this time.

485
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:53,251
Don't worry, honey. I won't.

486
00:33:54,168 --> 00:33:54,903
And.

487
00:33:56,028 --> 00:33:56,929
Keep in touch.

488
00:34:08,394 --> 00:34:09,514
Libby, darling.

489
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,018
Matt, my love.

490
00:34:12,056 --> 00:34:13,201
What can I do for you?

491
00:34:13,841 --> 00:34:15,228
What have you ever done for me?

492
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,152
Things are tough all over.

493
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:19,711
Why don't you drop in
more often.? Sort of ..

494
00:34:20,086 --> 00:34:23,481
Keep up my personal interest.
Give me .. enthusiasm for my work.

495
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:25,904
You've got plenty
of enthusiasm, brother.

496
00:34:26,123 --> 00:34:27,996
How about tonight?
I'll invest a dinner in you.

497
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:31,112
I can't tonight. I'm going
to a housewarming.

498
00:34:36,901 --> 00:34:38,238
Do you remember Marie?

499
00:34:38,914 --> 00:34:39,664
No.

500
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,981
Marie Willens.
- Oh yes.

501
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,813
You know, I just can't believe it.

502
00:34:44,121 --> 00:34:47,288
She's found a rich friend.
He sets her up in a gorgeous apartment.

503
00:34:47,602 --> 00:34:49,791
I have to go there tonight
and make like I'm not jealous.

504
00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:51,132
Why should you be?

505
00:34:51,431 --> 00:34:54,275
You can have the same  anytime you want.
All you got to do is ask.

506
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:57,091
But don't change the subject, Matt.

507
00:34:57,506 --> 00:34:59,920
You know, up to now Marie
has had some very bad luck.

508
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:02,711
I always thought she was a pretty girl.

509
00:35:03,112 --> 00:35:04,535
What's she doing these days?

510
00:35:05,046 --> 00:35:06,490
Still dancing.
- Is she working?

511
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:08,256
I don't think so. Why?

512
00:35:08,657 --> 00:35:12,065
I might find a spot for her somewhere.
Send her in tomorrow. I'll talk to her.

513
00:35:12,422 --> 00:35:13,402
Not tomorrow.

514
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,067
You see, she's had an accident.

515
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,267
Give her two or three days, huh?
- Okay.

516
00:35:18,013 --> 00:35:18,727
But.

517
00:35:21,516 --> 00:35:22,830
Let's talk about ..

518
00:35:24,342 --> 00:35:25,246
You.

519
00:35:26,822 --> 00:35:28,078
You do that, Matty.

520
00:35:28,531 --> 00:35:30,069
Let me know how it turns out.

521
00:35:34,244 --> 00:35:35,054
Bye now.

522
00:35:41,494 --> 00:35:43,094
Miss Willens.
- Good.

523
00:35:43,712 --> 00:35:44,875
Hello. Glad to see you.

524
00:35:46,223 --> 00:35:48,411
Mr Hethron - Mr Novok.
- Hello.

525
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:50,881
You really threw me with
this job talk, Mr Hethron.

526
00:35:51,385 --> 00:35:53,774
First we have to sell you.
I've got my piano player in there.

527
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:55,904
You can run through that
speciality of yours?

528
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,288
Sure.
- Good.

529
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,007
I should have my costume.

530
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:00,821
It's a tap number you know.

531
00:36:01,356 --> 00:36:02,286
That's alright.

532
00:36:07,816 --> 00:36:08,855
But Mr Hethron.

533
00:36:09,288 --> 00:36:11,313
I wear a leotard. A silver leotard.

534
00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:14,394
And a top hat and black
stockings and carry a cane.

535
00:36:15,184 --> 00:36:19,006
Miss Willens does the tap routine with
a silver leotard a hat and a cane.

536
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:30,885
Yeah, that's my tempo.
Now, start from the top please.

537
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:30,817
Eddie.

538
00:37:36,376 --> 00:37:38,092
That was my big break.

539
00:37:39,005 --> 00:37:40,777
Wouldn't you know I'd do that to it.

540
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:42,843
You had an accident.

541
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:45,604
Mr Hethron knows it.
He'll give you another chance.

542
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,373
What does the doctor say?

543
00:37:52,641 --> 00:37:54,285
He said you were still weak. That's all.

544
00:37:56,078 --> 00:37:56,836
But it ..

545
00:37:57,618 --> 00:37:58,908
It hurt, Eddie.

546
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:00,786
It really hurt.

547
00:38:02,053 --> 00:38:02,823
Sure.

548
00:38:04,362 --> 00:38:05,700
It's like a charley horse.

549
00:38:07,992 --> 00:38:09,165
I'm a dope.

550
00:38:10,236 --> 00:38:11,759
I got so scared.

551
00:38:17,056 --> 00:38:18,669
Do something for me will you, Eddie?

552
00:38:19,582 --> 00:38:20,308
Sure.

553
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:23,886
Don't go away.

554
00:38:24,948 --> 00:38:26,178
I'm scared.

555
00:38:29,145 --> 00:38:30,216
Stay with me.

556
00:38:31,953 --> 00:38:32,733
Sure.

557
00:38:37,623 --> 00:38:38,774
Sure, Marie.

558
00:38:44,797 --> 00:38:45,666
Hello Eddie.

559
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:49,088
What you trying to do?
Finish her off quick?

560
00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:50,925
I thought I made myself clear.

561
00:38:51,608 --> 00:38:54,724
I thought I told you to fix it so she
won't kill herself trying to find a job.

562
00:38:54,943 --> 00:38:56,731
You told me alright.
But you didn't say how.

563
00:38:57,031 --> 00:38:59,134
What do you think I'm doing,
saving up for her funeral?

564
00:38:59,456 --> 00:39:00,169
Look.

565
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,928
That's all I've got left. Three bucks.
- I'm bleeding for you.

566
00:39:04,294 --> 00:39:05,576
Why don't you get a job?

567
00:39:05,956 --> 00:39:07,454
What kind of a job can I get?

568
00:39:07,925 --> 00:39:10,263
I never had one in my life that
paid more than coffee and cake.

569
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:11,376
Seen Ketch?

570
00:39:16,351 --> 00:39:17,350
You are a cop.

571
00:39:18,017 --> 00:39:20,636
You think like a cop. You haven't
got what it takes to understand.

572
00:39:21,604 --> 00:39:24,373
I am going to take care of her but it
hasn't got anything to do with you.

573
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:27,894
Right now, anything you'd do
with me would be a pleasure.

574
00:39:41,997 --> 00:39:43,736
It isn't hot. I paid three bills for it.

575
00:39:44,056 --> 00:39:45,900
A hundred down and 2 bucks
a week for 2 years.

576
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:47,077
You were robbed.

577
00:39:47,405 --> 00:39:49,060
75 dollars is the best I can do.

578
00:39:49,715 --> 00:39:50,636
Seventy-five?

579
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,163
Well?

580
00:39:56,379 --> 00:39:57,251
I'll take it.

581
00:40:14,227 --> 00:40:15,442
I want to see you, Ketch.

582
00:40:16,236 --> 00:40:17,337
Sure, kid.

583
00:40:24,638 --> 00:40:25,838
I want to see you alone.

584
00:40:26,307 --> 00:40:27,042
Sure.

585
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,047
What is it? Money or the cops?

586
00:40:48,084 --> 00:40:48,944
Money.

587
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:50,206
How much?

588
00:40:52,009 --> 00:40:52,738
A grand.

589
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:56,932
You got a gall, I'll say that for you.

590
00:41:00,173 --> 00:41:02,106
Now why should I give you a grand?

591
00:41:04,165 --> 00:41:05,180
I'll pay you back.

592
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,704
I swear I'll pay you back.

593
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,004
I'll make it up to you.
I'll work for you.

594
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:13,361
You'll work for me? You'll pay me back.

595
00:41:14,376 --> 00:41:15,912
How much, two bits a week?

596
00:41:16,695 --> 00:41:17,824
You'll do me favors.

597
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:21,903
Right now I got 50 guys like you to do
me favors and I don't have to pay them.

598
00:41:23,202 --> 00:41:24,655
You forget something, Ketch.

599
00:41:25,435 --> 00:41:27,521
There is one favor I can do
you that nobody else can.

600
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:30,358
And I've been doing it.

601
00:42:16,585 --> 00:42:18,348
I made a mistake about that guy.

602
00:42:19,431 --> 00:42:20,359
Yeah, I did.

603
00:42:21,514 --> 00:42:22,872
I don't like it the way it is.

604
00:42:23,744 --> 00:42:25,167
You guys may have to fix it.

605
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:32,472
No, no Matt.

606
00:42:32,691 --> 00:42:34,597
Come on baby. It's like I told you.

607
00:42:34,947 --> 00:42:37,413
If you want me to behave why not
marry me? Then I'll be a good boy.

608
00:42:37,779 --> 00:42:38,995
I have a picture of that.

609
00:42:39,282 --> 00:42:41,202
You being a good boy with
those blondes around.

610
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,175
Honey, give me a chance. I'll prove it.

611
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:45,312
There won't be any blondes.
I won't handle them.

612
00:42:45,611 --> 00:42:46,906
Just acrobats and jugglers.

613
00:42:48,423 --> 00:42:49,181
So funny.

614
00:42:49,712 --> 00:42:50,493
Waiter.

615
00:42:50,982 --> 00:42:52,312
No, Eddie. Give me the check.

616
00:42:52,592 --> 00:42:54,522
Wait a minute. This is my party.
It was my idea.

617
00:42:54,852 --> 00:42:56,067
It might be pretty steep.

618
00:42:56,749 --> 00:42:58,223
Just my left arm. That's all.

619
00:43:00,016 --> 00:43:01,105
I feel good.

620
00:43:03,142 --> 00:43:04,139
Very good.

621
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,567
More wine, brandy, cordial anybody?

622
00:43:08,026 --> 00:43:08,721
On me.

623
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,256
Darling, after that dinner?

624
00:43:10,676 --> 00:43:12,111
We'll have to diet for a week.

625
00:43:12,906 --> 00:43:15,069
Let's not stay here all night.
What will we do?

626
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,270
Go where we can dance.

627
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:19,588
I want you children to put
yourselves in my hands.

628
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,534
I know the spot. The show will kill you.

629
00:43:21,907 --> 00:43:24,818
I've got an act there. It's a honey.
The most beautiful ..

630
00:43:25,542 --> 00:43:26,771
Comic, dear.
- Yes.

631
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:30,002
Take a taxi or walk?

632
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:31,923
We'll walk. It's only two blocks. Okay?

633
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:32,787
Okay.

634
00:43:37,862 --> 00:43:39,106
Please Eddie, let's dance.

635
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:41,242
Pardon us.
- Yes. Marie.

636
00:44:02,668 --> 00:44:03,729
Hello Eddie.

637
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,630
I want you to meet Miss Willens.

638
00:44:07,818 --> 00:44:10,259
This is Mr Bernie Sallin.
- How do you do.

639
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:46,079
See, I said I wasn't too tired to dance.

640
00:44:46,403 --> 00:44:48,077
Honey, do you think ..
- Don't spoil it.

641
00:44:48,484 --> 00:44:49,722
I'm having so much fun.

642
00:45:13,234 --> 00:45:14,060
What is it?

643
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:15,521
Nothing.

644
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:17,372
I just felt dizzy for a minute.

645
00:45:17,877 --> 00:45:19,372
You alright?
- Yeah.

646
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:21,133
I'm alright.

647
00:45:29,494 --> 00:45:30,423
Here, sit down.

648
00:45:30,642 --> 00:45:32,872
No Eddie, it's nothing.
Honest, I'm alright.

649
00:45:33,113 --> 00:45:35,416
Look, I'm going to find a taxi.
You sit there and wait for me.

650
00:45:35,798 --> 00:45:37,844
I'm going to take you right home.
- But Eddie, I ..

651
00:45:41,395 --> 00:45:43,642
I just got a little dizzy
for a minute and he ..

652
00:45:45,545 --> 00:45:47,215
So he thinks you're made of glass?

653
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,163
Is that bad?

654
00:45:49,681 --> 00:45:50,774
Sometimes.

655
00:45:56,174 --> 00:45:57,600
I got a cab waiting right here.

656
00:45:59,188 --> 00:46:00,304
Come on, Marie.

657
00:46:01,784 --> 00:46:02,971
I don't want to go home.

658
00:46:03,191 --> 00:46:04,578
Please honey.
- It isn't nice.

659
00:46:04,906 --> 00:46:06,637
You're spoiling it for
Libby and Matt too.

660
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:12,981
Hi.

661
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:18,636
It looks like you go where I go.

662
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,805
Yeah. It seems that way, doesn't it.

663
00:46:21,765 --> 00:46:23,406
You're the one that was in a hurry.

664
00:46:40,821 --> 00:46:42,065
Try using the motor, Jack.

665
00:46:42,683 --> 00:46:44,843
When we get to your home I
want you to go right upstairs.

666
00:46:45,263 --> 00:46:46,635
You do? That does it.

667
00:46:47,521 --> 00:46:49,584
You got some nerve treating
me like I was a kid.

668
00:46:49,953 --> 00:46:50,854
Or an invalid.

669
00:46:51,455 --> 00:46:52,861
Why did you get so scared?

670
00:46:53,606 --> 00:46:55,704
I'm not scared.
Will you do what I tell you please?

671
00:46:56,029 --> 00:46:56,900
Don't worry.

672
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,193
I don't want to be with you
any more than you with me.

673
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:01,077
Look, it's not like that.

674
00:47:01,709 --> 00:47:04,128
It's a thing I can't explain right now.
- Don't bother.

675
00:47:40,554 --> 00:47:43,986
"<i>Bus leaving for Trenton,
Philadelphia and Baltimore</i>."

676
00:47:44,287 --> 00:47:46,720
How much is the bus fare to Chicago?
- $39.50.

677
00:47:51,638 --> 00:47:55,891
"<i>Bus leaving for Trenton,
Philadelphia and Baltimore</i>."

678
00:48:10,408 --> 00:48:14,614
"<i>Bus leaving for Harrisburg,
Pittsburgh and Columbus</i>."

679
00:48:23,214 --> 00:48:26,639
"<i>Bus leaving for Harrisburg,
Pittsburgh and Columbus</i>."

680
00:48:46,555 --> 00:48:50,628
"<i>Bus leaving for Cleveland,
Chicago and St Louis</i>."

681
00:48:55,889 --> 00:48:58,540
How did you come, by dog-sled?
- You have something to tell me?

682
00:48:59,615 --> 00:49:00,744
Let's get some coffee.

683
00:49:00,963 --> 00:49:04,920
"<i>Bus leaving for Cleveland,
Chicago and St Louis</i>."

684
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:12,502
You said you had a deal.

685
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:14,832
What is it?

686
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:17,252
I gotta get out of town.

687
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,860
I got to take her with me.
I want you to help us.

688
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,045
Later, when she ..

689
00:49:25,082 --> 00:49:26,588
You get yourself a killer.

690
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,493
And a hit-and-run driver for a bonus.

691
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,647
How do I know you won't run out on me?

692
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:34,261
If I could I'd be on a
bus now, wouldn't I?

693
00:49:35,362 --> 00:49:37,006
You got enough dough to take care of it?

694
00:49:38,445 --> 00:49:39,489
How did you get it?

695
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,109
I told you I had to leave town.
You figure it out.

696
00:49:46,072 --> 00:49:47,166
What's your problem?

697
00:49:47,649 --> 00:49:49,122
They've been tailing me all night.

698
00:49:50,174 --> 00:49:52,996
I wasn't sure of it but when I got to my
place one of them was waiting for me.

699
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:56,347
I lost him but they'll be at
her house waiting for her now.

700
00:49:58,223 --> 00:49:59,209
I got to get her.

701
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,532
But I got to have some
place to take her.

702
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:07,230
Wait here.

703
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:13,322
"<i>Bus now leaving for Trenton,
Camden, Philadelphia</i>."

704
00:50:40,918 --> 00:50:41,614
Hey.

705
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:43,050
Come here.

706
00:50:45,128 --> 00:50:46,760
You were wrong calling me a cop.

707
00:50:47,055 --> 00:50:48,872
I've a friend who has a
place in the country.

708
00:50:49,125 --> 00:50:50,770
Ask what time the bus leaves for Harmon.

709
00:50:51,016 --> 00:50:53,173
Where it stops along the
way and how long. Get it?

710
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:56,184
And call her. Tell her to get ready,
to trust you and not get scared.

711
00:50:56,643 --> 00:50:57,630
What will you do?

712
00:50:57,859 --> 00:51:00,135
Dr Wirth doesn't know it
but he's going to help too.

713
00:52:26,273 --> 00:52:27,964
Here they come now. Let's get rolling.

714
00:53:31,503 --> 00:53:33,642
How dumb can you get.
- But, boss ..

715
00:53:33,861 --> 00:53:36,435
Don't give me the 'But' routine.
Hoist up onto your feet and find him.

716
00:53:36,902 --> 00:53:38,031
How can we find him ..

717
00:53:38,997 --> 00:53:40,189
I said, find him.

718
00:53:41,424 --> 00:53:43,396
Just find him.
Leave the rest of it to me.

719
00:53:54,165 --> 00:53:54,837
Hello?

720
00:53:56,827 --> 00:53:57,763
Smiley.

721
00:53:59,057 --> 00:53:59,843
Telephone.

722
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:06,309
Yeah?

723
00:54:06,895 --> 00:54:09,235
He paid 483.60 and 220.

724
00:54:31,648 --> 00:54:32,952
Want a soda?
- Nah.

725
00:54:33,698 --> 00:54:35,860
You came in here.
You must have wanted something.

726
00:54:39,792 --> 00:54:41,150
I want to know where Eddie is.

727
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,905
Sammy will tell you. Won't you, Sammy?

728
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:45,551
I don't know.

729
00:54:46,196 --> 00:54:47,383
He didn't come in for ..

730
00:54:47,728 --> 00:54:48,725
For three days.

731
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:51,583
You think he knows but won't tell us?
- Maybe.

732
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,290
Maybe he needs a little
of the treatment.

733
00:54:56,728 --> 00:54:59,388
I .. I told you I don't know.

734
00:55:00,595 --> 00:55:01,947
No. He doesn't know.

735
00:55:02,968 --> 00:55:04,104
He would tell you.

736
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:07,184
He knows what's going to happen
to him if we found out he knew.

737
00:55:07,798 --> 00:55:08,899
And wouldn't tell us.

738
00:55:12,454 --> 00:55:13,212
Hoodlums.

739
00:55:18,024 --> 00:55:19,039
Yeah. I heard him.

740
00:56:05,389 --> 00:56:08,558
I wouldn't tell them.
If they killed me I wouldn't tell.

741
00:56:40,803 --> 00:56:42,103
I bet you got a sore neck.

742
00:56:44,102 --> 00:56:47,115
I guess you think I'm silly lying
here like this all afternoon.

743
00:56:48,648 --> 00:56:51,621
All my life I wanted to fall
asleep in front of a fireplace.

744
00:56:52,865 --> 00:56:53,739
Now I did it.

745
00:56:58,753 --> 00:56:59,554
Still mad?

746
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:01,094
I wasn't mad.

747
00:57:01,998 --> 00:57:04,990
It's only I thought maybe you
wanted to tell me things.

748
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:08,833
But if you can't ..

749
00:57:10,092 --> 00:57:11,565
It hasn't anything to do with you.

750
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,711
It's my own troubles that
make me act the way I did.

751
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:17,062
But at the club you were
so careful of me and ..

752
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:21,253
You would tell me if there was something
wrong with me, wouldn't you, Eddie?

753
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:22,722
Sure.

754
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:25,812
Like it here?

755
00:57:26,228 --> 00:57:27,159
Oh, yes.

756
00:57:28,008 --> 00:57:31,178
I thought the apartment was
something but this is even better.

757
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,568
I've never seen such a beautiful place.

758
00:57:35,098 --> 00:57:36,957
You must have an awfully nice friend.

759
00:57:38,281 --> 00:57:39,878
Only ..
- Only what?

760
00:57:40,816 --> 00:57:41,802
I'm hungry.

761
00:57:42,491 --> 00:57:44,845
That was practically breakfast
we had and not lunch.

762
00:57:45,181 --> 00:57:46,883
I know. I was going
to fix you something.

763
00:57:47,102 --> 00:57:48,603
There's stuff in the kitchen but ..

764
00:57:49,164 --> 00:57:51,038
There is a gasoline
stove and I'm afraid of it.

765
00:57:52,401 --> 00:57:53,387
It might explode.

766
00:57:53,819 --> 00:57:54,624
Come on.

767
00:57:57,375 --> 00:57:58,811
Let's go find some place to eat.

768
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,151
This is an occasion.

769
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:04,957
I ought to put my face on.

770
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,787
I like it the way it is.

771
00:58:10,814 --> 00:58:11,543
Come on.

772
00:58:22,401 --> 00:58:24,251
How do you like these apple-knockers?

773
00:58:24,523 --> 00:58:27,273
You think they'd have sense to turn
the lights off when the joint is closed.

774
00:58:27,562 --> 00:58:28,463
Wait a minute.

775
00:58:34,715 --> 00:58:37,891
Maybe there is someplace else.
- Sure. About ten miles down the road.

776
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:41,123
Come on.
- Somebody's coming.

777
00:58:45,811 --> 00:58:47,313
Want something, folks?
- Eats.

778
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:49,202
Sorry. We're closed.

779
00:58:49,623 --> 00:58:51,884
But we'll be open again in
October when deer season starts.

780
00:58:52,171 --> 00:58:53,358
That's fine. We'll wait.

781
00:58:53,642 --> 00:58:54,645
Are you hungry?

782
00:58:55,142 --> 00:58:56,397
That's a fine question.

783
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,776
It's just that we don't have
a car and it's a long walk.

784
00:58:59,655 --> 00:59:01,670
Well, come on in.
- Thanks.

785
00:59:03,472 --> 00:59:06,030
It won't be much but I'll
rustle up something for you.

786
00:59:07,213 --> 00:59:09,635
A ham sandwich maybe
and .. a cup of coffee.

787
00:59:11,018 --> 00:59:12,649
Got some eggs too, come to think of it.

788
00:59:13,168 --> 00:59:15,457
It will take about ten minutes.
Now don't starve on me.

789
00:59:17,863 --> 00:59:20,443
You see, all you have to
do is use your charm.

790
00:59:20,794 --> 00:59:22,238
I would if I had some like yours.

791
00:59:22,925 --> 00:59:24,204
Well, be charming.

792
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:26,289
Go on. Try it.

793
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:33,826
Charming.

794
00:59:41,425 --> 00:59:42,776
[ Radio music ]

795
00:59:44,355 --> 00:59:45,113
Charming.

796
00:59:46,013 --> 00:59:47,754
Flowers, music, soft lights.

797
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:50,581
No-one can say I don't take
you to the best places.

798
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:52,325
And exclusive too.

799
00:59:54,317 --> 00:59:55,473
May I have this dance?

800
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:56,907
You can have all of them.

801
00:59:57,419 --> 00:59:58,723
Unless somebody cuts in.

802
01:01:36,631 --> 01:01:38,051
Look at me. I'm a wood chopper.

803
01:01:42,743 --> 01:01:44,422
Woodsman, woodsman, spare that tree.

804
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:45,668
Touch not a ..

805
01:01:53,786 --> 01:01:55,344
I can't walk, Eddie.

806
01:01:58,837 --> 01:01:59,709
Does it hurt?

807
01:02:00,302 --> 01:02:01,577
No. It did but now.

808
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:12,006
But I can't walk.

809
01:02:12,885 --> 01:02:14,344
I've tried. I can't.

810
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:18,905
Where are you going?

811
01:02:20,276 --> 01:02:22,111
I'm going down the
road to call Dr Wirth.

812
01:02:22,451 --> 01:02:24,657
No. I don't want you to go.
I want you to stay with me.

813
01:02:24,967 --> 01:02:26,179
Honey, I've got to.

814
01:02:26,808 --> 01:02:28,563
Look, just lie here.

815
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:33,775
It's going to be alright.

816
01:02:37,714 --> 01:02:39,741
No, Eddie. Don't go.
Don't leave me alone.

817
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,728
Honey, I must call him.
It won't take long.

818
01:02:41,947 --> 01:02:43,589
Eddie, please.
- I'll be right back.

819
01:02:44,031 --> 01:02:45,075
I'll run both ways.

820
01:02:47,693 --> 01:02:48,737
I'll be right back.

821
01:03:00,641 --> 01:03:02,117
I'll get up and see you again.

822
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:04,606
Now you be a good
girl and sleep tonight.

823
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:06,553
Goodbye.

824
01:03:10,864 --> 01:03:11,860
Wait a minute.

825
01:03:13,025 --> 01:03:14,613
Better tell me the truth for a change.

826
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,027
I have told you the truth, Marie.
- No you haven't.

827
01:03:17,723 --> 01:03:18,653
Neither has he.

828
01:03:19,005 --> 01:03:20,675
You've been lying to me all along.

829
01:03:21,141 --> 01:03:23,794
I'm sick. He wouldn't be so
worried about me if I wasn't.

830
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:28,752
You are lying to me.
I know you are lying to me.

831
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:30,936
No. I'm not lying to you.

832
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:32,664
I'm telling you the truth.

833
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:34,366
I don't believe it.

834
01:03:39,706 --> 01:03:40,709
You mean I am ..

835
01:03:41,528 --> 01:03:42,459
Going to die?

836
01:03:43,247 --> 01:03:44,269
No. No you're not.

837
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:46,518
You're going to get better.
- Don't, Eddie.

838
01:03:47,293 --> 01:03:48,396
It's no use.

839
01:04:19,729 --> 01:04:20,830
Why did you tell her?

840
01:04:21,335 --> 01:04:24,169
You didn't have to tell her.
- I didn't really. She sensed it.

841
01:04:25,384 --> 01:04:28,172
It's far better this way.
I've seen it so many times.

842
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:31,224
They make an adjustment and it
is easier than the uncertainty.

843
01:04:31,985 --> 01:04:33,057
When do you think ..

844
01:04:34,745 --> 01:04:35,817
I mean, how long?

845
01:04:36,501 --> 01:04:37,920
That's hard to judge.

846
01:04:38,515 --> 01:04:39,866
A month. Perhaps more.

847
01:04:40,661 --> 01:04:42,096
Or she may outlive both of us.

848
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,452
Thanks.

849
01:04:45,609 --> 01:04:46,566
Thanks a lot.

850
01:05:08,915 --> 01:05:10,586
Eddie, will you do something for me?

851
01:05:11,459 --> 01:05:12,151
Sure.

852
01:05:14,821 --> 01:05:15,961
Will you marry me?

853
01:05:17,821 --> 01:05:19,636
But maybe you never
wanted to get married.

854
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:21,951
Some men feel like they are caught.

855
01:05:22,601 --> 01:05:24,775
That has nothing to do with it.
I don't feel like that.

856
01:05:25,738 --> 01:05:28,232
But this is different. It wouldn't ..
- I can't.

857
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,144
I can't explain it.

858
01:05:32,105 --> 01:05:33,304
Do you love me, Eddie?

859
01:05:34,452 --> 01:05:35,353
You know I do.

860
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:38,621
Then ..?
- I can't.

861
01:05:40,457 --> 01:05:41,640
And I know why it is.

862
01:05:44,692 --> 01:05:46,420
It's because you were
the one who hit me.

863
01:05:56,513 --> 01:05:57,789
Don't feel so bad.

864
01:05:58,364 --> 01:05:59,770
You did everything you could.

865
01:06:03,181 --> 01:06:05,129
Eddie, you mustn't go
on blaming yourself.

866
01:06:05,737 --> 01:06:06,810
Nobody is blameless.

867
01:06:08,056 --> 01:06:09,757
The first day you came
to the hospital ..

868
01:06:09,976 --> 01:06:11,821
I thought you were from
the insurance company.

869
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:13,798
If you only knew how I was ..

870
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:16,590
Trying to work you and get
everything I could out of you.

871
01:06:16,903 --> 01:06:18,319
Then you'd ..
- Don't say that.

872
01:06:19,854 --> 01:06:20,765
Please, Eddie.

873
01:06:23,178 --> 01:06:24,536
I didn't care before but ..

874
01:06:25,509 --> 01:06:26,795
Now it's different.

875
01:06:55,163 --> 01:06:56,006
What's that?

876
01:06:56,517 --> 01:06:57,503
Nothing. Nothing.

877
01:06:58,517 --> 01:06:59,704
A regular Beau Brummell.

878
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:01,409
Going somewhere?

879
01:07:02,709 --> 01:07:04,164
To see my relative in ..

880
01:07:04,531 --> 01:07:05,686
In Bensonhurst.

881
01:07:06,005 --> 01:07:08,762
I got relatives in Bensonhurst
myself but I never go to see them.

882
01:07:08,981 --> 01:07:10,958
And if I did I wouldn't
get that dressed up.

883
01:07:11,545 --> 01:07:12,427
Yes, Miss?

884
01:07:12,836 --> 01:07:14,144
Do you sell me jelly beans?

885
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,516
Yes. Jelly beans.

886
01:07:33,097 --> 01:07:34,506
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

887
01:07:43,596 --> 01:07:44,863
Let me talk to Ketch.

888
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:05,614
I'll be right with you.

889
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:07,562
Okay, mister.

890
01:08:12,768 --> 01:08:13,697
Thank you, sir.

891
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:17,001
You're new here. Huh?

892
01:08:17,266 --> 01:08:19,095
Yeah. The guy that used
to work here is sick.

893
01:08:19,989 --> 01:08:21,290
I ought to charge you extra.

894
01:08:22,778 --> 01:08:24,251
What makes your big feet so large?

895
01:08:27,273 --> 01:08:28,305
Any excitement?

896
01:08:28,823 --> 01:08:29,422
No.

897
01:08:30,053 --> 01:08:32,214
It's been so quiet I'm kinda
worried about the business.

898
01:08:33,555 --> 01:08:34,541
What about Ketch?

899
01:08:35,142 --> 01:08:36,758
He went inside. He hasn't come out yet.

900
01:08:41,987 --> 01:08:43,033
Call that a shine?

901
01:08:44,197 --> 01:08:45,912
Look at all the territory
I had to cover.

902
01:08:46,499 --> 01:08:49,080
It reminds me of the beat I pounded
before they made me a detective.

903
01:08:56,379 --> 01:08:57,165
Don't cry.

904
01:08:59,318 --> 01:09:00,726
Women always cry at weddings.

905
01:09:02,585 --> 01:09:03,775
But not at mine.

906
01:09:05,646 --> 01:09:07,841
I could never be as
brave as you are, Marie.

907
01:09:08,684 --> 01:09:10,014
You're not as happy as I am.

908
01:09:26,094 --> 01:09:28,563
Where's the Justice of the Peace?
Hasn't he come yet?

909
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:31,258
What time is it?

910
01:09:31,756 --> 01:09:32,657
Ten after two.

911
01:09:33,338 --> 01:09:35,533
But relax. He's only ten minutes late.

912
01:09:36,033 --> 01:09:38,650
He may be lost. I'll run down to
the back road and look for him.

913
01:09:38,869 --> 01:09:40,413
No Eddie. I'll go.
- I'll do it.

914
01:09:43,497 --> 01:09:46,112
When a man is going to
marry, keep him busy.

915
01:09:46,455 --> 01:09:48,648
And after the wedding, leave him alone.

916
01:09:49,253 --> 01:09:50,068
You get it?

917
01:10:08,152 --> 01:10:09,260
Wait a minute!

918
01:10:10,246 --> 01:10:11,569
Hold it. Hold it!

919
01:10:27,499 --> 01:10:28,454
Surprise.

920
01:10:33,461 --> 01:10:34,420
Turn around.

921
01:10:34,639 --> 01:10:36,083
Ketch, you can't.
- Turn around.

922
01:10:36,348 --> 01:10:38,014
Walk until I tell you to stop.

923
01:10:55,308 --> 01:10:57,206
There's people in the house.
They'll hear you.

924
01:10:57,425 --> 01:10:59,586
They'll think somebody is
shooting a rabbit. Keep moving.

925
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:04,136
Alright.

926
01:11:09,649 --> 01:11:10,598
Listen, Ketch.

927
01:11:11,401 --> 01:11:13,490
I got a girl.
- I got a lot of girls. So what?

928
01:11:14,034 --> 01:11:15,993
But she needs me. She's sick.
She's going to die.

929
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:17,475
You can keep her company.

930
01:11:18,156 --> 01:11:20,430
Turn around.
- Ketch, listen please. Please.

931
01:11:21,308 --> 01:11:23,257
Please. Just give me a little time.

932
01:11:23,937 --> 01:11:25,937
Just a couple of days. Today, we ..
- Shut up.

933
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:29,934
Turn around.

934
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:34,581
Start walking.

935
01:11:42,012 --> 01:11:43,065
[ Gunshot! ]

936
01:12:05,553 --> 01:12:07,468
Been hanging around here all afternoon.

937
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,750
Aren't you going to say thank you?

938
01:12:12,205 --> 01:12:14,479
I'm sorry kid. I'm afraid this
means I've got to take you in.

939
01:12:15,924 --> 01:12:16,835
Come on.

940
01:12:17,755 --> 01:12:18,694
How is Marie?

941
01:12:20,694 --> 01:12:21,892
She had another attack.

942
01:12:23,107 --> 01:12:24,036
She can't walk.

943
01:12:26,002 --> 01:12:27,790
We were going to get
married this afternoon.

944
01:12:30,152 --> 01:12:31,335
She is going to die.

945
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:34,576
The doctor said it might only be a week.

946
01:12:36,871 --> 01:12:37,643
Please.

947
01:12:39,114 --> 01:12:40,603
Give me a little time with her.

948
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:42,193
I can't. I can't.

949
01:12:42,522 --> 01:12:44,023
I've got to report this right away.

950
01:12:46,247 --> 01:12:48,130
If you want to make a
statement about Ketch ..

951
01:12:48,349 --> 01:12:50,446
I think you'll get off easy
on the hit-and-run charge.

952
01:12:51,213 --> 01:12:52,457
What do I care about that?

953
01:12:53,072 --> 01:12:54,541
Afterwards, they can hang me.

954
01:12:56,274 --> 01:12:57,346
I want to marry her.

955
01:12:57,983 --> 01:12:59,384
I don't want her to be alone.

956
01:13:01,607 --> 01:13:03,647
You said it yourself once. I am a cop.

957
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:06,501
There are some things
I just can't do, kid.

958
01:13:09,397 --> 01:13:10,040
Look.

959
01:13:11,196 --> 01:13:12,645
Look, what am I asking you for?

960
01:13:13,318 --> 01:13:15,255
You shot Ketch because
he tried to plug you.

961
01:13:15,638 --> 01:13:16,939
You got what you were after.

962
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:20,667
All you have is a hit and run.
You let it go. Let it go a bit longer.

963
01:13:21,392 --> 01:13:23,187
I've a lot of explaining to do as it is.

964
01:13:23,746 --> 01:13:27,219
If I try to stall this long enough to do
any good the coroner will figure it out.

965
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:29,396
Come on.

966
01:13:33,425 --> 01:13:34,526
You helped me before.

967
01:13:35,706 --> 01:13:37,390
It wasn't just because you wanted Ketch.

968
01:13:39,022 --> 01:13:41,239
It was because you saw what
was going on with me and Marie.

969
01:13:41,858 --> 01:13:44,250
You know what I was before this
happened, Where I was heading.

970
01:13:44,975 --> 01:13:46,362
I guess she wasn't much better.

971
01:13:48,271 --> 01:13:49,458
But it's different now.

972
01:13:51,017 --> 01:13:53,762
We got something we never
would have had otherwise.

973
01:13:57,308 --> 01:13:58,625
I can't talk about it good.

974
01:14:00,003 --> 01:14:01,046
But we got it.

975
01:14:01,515 --> 01:14:02,587
I know we've got it.

976
01:14:03,778 --> 01:14:05,651
And I want her to have
it as long as she lives.

977
01:14:08,318 --> 01:14:09,133
Afterwards.

978
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:12,559
I'm willing to pay for it,
no matter what it costs.

979
01:14:21,629 --> 01:14:23,225
It must be the Justice of the Peace.

980
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:25,592
Sorry.

981
01:14:27,187 --> 01:14:29,232
I'm afraid you're going to
be late for your wedding.

982
01:14:30,126 --> 01:14:32,918
I've got a little straightening
out to do. I can't come.

983
01:14:44,094 --> 01:14:44,901
Beat it.

984
01:14:56,883 --> 01:14:57,969
I, Edward Novok.

985
01:14:58,589 --> 01:15:00,301
Take this woman for my lawful wife.

986
01:15:01,434 --> 01:15:03,164
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

987
01:15:03,594 --> 01:15:05,125
For better, for worse.

988
01:15:05,876 --> 01:15:07,228
For richer, for poorer.

989
01:15:08,026 --> 01:15:09,219
For better, for worse.

990
01:15:09,883 --> 01:15:11,041
For richer, for poorer.

991
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:13,148
In sickness and in health.

992
01:15:13,617 --> 01:15:15,360
Until death do us part.

993
01:15:18,021 --> 01:15:19,265
In sickness and in health.

994
01:15:19,796 --> 01:15:21,023
Until death do us part.

995
01:15:22,244 --> 01:15:23,372
I, Marie Willens.

996
01:15:23,591 --> 01:15:26,479
I, Marie Willens take this
man for my lawful husband.

997
01:15:27,338 --> 01:15:29,477
To have and to hold
from this day forward.

998
01:15:30,286 --> 01:15:32,782
For better, for worse.
For richer, for poorer.

999
01:15:33,272 --> 01:15:35,829
In sickness and in health
until death do us part.

1000
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,186
The ring, please.

1001
01:15:42,021 --> 01:15:44,021
Now, will you put that
on her finger please.

1002
01:15:46,965 --> 01:15:49,214
And now by the authority invested in me.

1003
01:15:49,913 --> 01:15:52,012
I pronounce you man and wife.

1004
01:16:16,899 --> 01:16:17,594
Eddie.

1005
01:16:22,392 --> 01:16:23,040
Well.

1006
01:16:25,106 --> 01:16:25,916
Good luck.

1007
01:16:33,244 --> 01:16:34,572
Marie, we have to go.

1008
01:16:35,431 --> 01:16:36,074
Matt.

1009
01:16:36,401 --> 01:16:37,408
Must you?

1010
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:38,814
Yes.

1011
01:16:39,331 --> 01:16:40,504
We got to get along.

1012
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:43,595
Sammy, you coming?

1013
01:16:43,927 --> 01:16:45,154
Just a minute.

1014
01:16:45,650 --> 01:16:48,431
There is something my
people do at weddings.

1015
01:16:49,143 --> 01:16:51,257
Maybe I could if you don't mind?

1016
01:16:51,678 --> 01:16:52,595
Sure, Sammy.

1017
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:07,495
God's blessing.

1018
01:17:08,524 --> 01:17:09,339
I wish you.

1019
01:17:12,026 --> 01:17:14,768
Also. Broken glass brings luck.

1020
01:17:15,472 --> 01:17:17,416
If it is broken by somebody who ..

1021
01:17:17,754 --> 01:17:18,683
Who loves you.

1022
01:17:36,024 --> 01:17:39,166
You know, Eddie.
Once, I myself was two times married.

1023
01:17:39,997 --> 01:17:42,387
The minister was there. I was there.

1024
01:17:43,321 --> 01:17:44,826
But the bride never showed up.

1025
01:17:47,547 --> 01:17:48,908
Enjoy this happiness.

1026
01:17:49,396 --> 01:17:50,105
Thanks.

1027
01:18:10,976 --> 01:18:12,237
We forgot the cake.

1028
01:18:14,535 --> 01:18:16,094
We can eat it for breakfast tomorrow.

1029
01:18:17,985 --> 01:18:18,800
It's funny.

1030
01:18:19,546 --> 01:18:21,152
It was just like it is in stories.

1031
01:18:23,274 --> 01:18:24,507
Were you scared?

1032
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:29,453
How do you feel?

1033
01:18:30,011 --> 01:18:31,211
I do feel fine.

1034
01:18:33,072 --> 01:18:33,892
Maybe.

1035
01:18:35,035 --> 01:18:37,629
How does the doctor know?
He could be wrong.

1036
01:18:38,711 --> 01:18:39,535
Well.

1037
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:42,277
Sometimes doctors make mistakes too.
Like everybody else.

1038
01:18:44,504 --> 01:18:45,266
Sure.

1039
01:18:45,725 --> 01:18:47,078
Sure they do.

1040
01:18:48,424 --> 01:18:49,144
Eddie.

1041
01:18:49,768 --> 01:18:50,447
Huh?

1042
01:18:51,382 --> 01:18:52,426
Let's make believe.

1043
01:18:54,387 --> 01:18:55,466
Make believe what?

1044
01:18:56,753 --> 01:18:57,951
That it is for ever.

1045
01:19:04,967 --> 01:19:06,004
It <i>is</i> forever.

1046
01:19:21,560 --> 01:19:22,752
..s-d..
