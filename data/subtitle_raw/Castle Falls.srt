2
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,900
That's good.

3
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:37,669
All right, three rounds.

4
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,372
I wanna finish, but don't
leave it up to me.

5
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,340
Time.

6
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,342
Vince is in the office.

7
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,479
<i>We got a lot of
talented guys coming up.</i>

8
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,414
Young guys.

9
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:32,684
Potential's all I
got to work with.

10
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:34,119
This ain't news, Mike.

11
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,822
Vince, come on, please
just get me a fight, right?

12
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:39,891
170, 185, flippin'
205 if I have to.

13
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:43,462
You... you got submitted
in your last three fights.

14
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,864
None of my sponsors are gonna touch you.

15
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,136
Okay, look.

16
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:54,706
I shouldn't have let you fight
injured. Some of that's on me.

17
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,842
Yeah, well don't worry about
that 'cause I got the surgery

18
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,944
and the shoulder feels good, right?
I'm ready to get back in there,

19
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,645
come on Vince, please, please!

20
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,382
Mike, you're a friend.

21
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,150
But I'm trying to
run a business.

22
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,986
You're a sparring partner.

23
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,721
Oh, I'm a
sparring partner, am I?

24
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:10,789
Not a contender.

25
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,059
You don't have the
killer instinct.

26
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:18,897
I can't make you into something you're not.
I'm sorry, it's over.

27
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,600
I came here because you
sold me on this gym.

28
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:24,002
I came here 'cause of you.
Remember that?

29
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,604
And now you're just gonna
turn around and say,

30
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:27,139
that's it, you're finished?

31
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:28,774
It's a young man's game.

32
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:30,742
You know this.

33
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,760
Right, don't do this to me.

34
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:34,779
Okay, you got a lotta good,
talented fighters here, yeah?

35
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:36,882
Good talent, but they haven't
got what I've got, right?

36
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,083
They don't have the experience,

37
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,018
they don't have the
knowledge of the game.

38
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,187
Vince, I'm begging you, please.

39
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,956
Mike, I don't know what else to
say, I'm sorry.

40
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,701
Right, you let me fight for it
then, right now.

41
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,871
- Mike...
- No, you give me one last shot.

42
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:00,972
Right, you owe me.

43
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,142
I'll fight your
golden boy out there,

44
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:06,044
right now, today, let's do it.

45
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,679
<i> He's six weeks out</i>
<i>from a fight,</i>

46
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:08,914
and you're not even in shape.

47
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,148
Yeah, well he's not
gonna have an excuse

48
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,217
when I kick the crap out of him
then, is he?

49
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:13,685
<i>Come on, Vince.</i>

50
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:16,054
One last shot.

51
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:18,590
I fight him right
now, and if I win?

52
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,158
You put me on the next card.

53
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,228
If he wins, then fine, fine.

54
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,531
I'm done, I'll walk away.

55
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,534
You're fucking nuts.

56
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,915
Okay I did it, he's done.

57
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,976
<i>You don't have
the killer instinct.</i>

58
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,044
<i>It's over.</i>

59
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,213
<i>It's over.</i>

60
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,082
<i>It's over.</i>

61
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:25,584
I'm gonna have to get a guard
dog now that you're leaving.

62
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,252
We are gonna miss you.

63
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,289
I'll hold onto that deposit,

64
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,059
and we'll just call that
the last three months' rent.

65
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,862
You're a good man, Phil.

66
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,865
I really appreciate everything
you've done for me.

67
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,602
See you around, Phil.

68
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,005
You keep
your head up, huh?

69
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:53,111
Don't worry about
me, Phil, I'm good.

70
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,388
Hey Mike, when's
your next fight?

71
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:06,891
Come here, lads.

72
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:16,334
Think maybe you guys
should take over, don't you?

73
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,903
- Thank you.
- There you go.

74
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,139
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

75
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,241
- Let's go.
- Stay out of trouble.

76
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,776
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

77
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,219
It's a young man's game.

78
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,584
Skills, degrees?

79
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,853
Did a bit of construction

80
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,955
back in the UK,
in between fights.

81
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,491
Other than that, though...

82
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,462
Oh, here we go, you're in luck.

83
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:33,298
Oh yeah, what have you got?

84
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,034
They've been at it a week,
but there's a couple days left.

85
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,102
What is it, construction?

86
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,207
Not exactly construction,
but it's close.

87
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:03,995
All right, buddy?

88
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,931
I'm here for the, uh, you know,
the construction.

89
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,466
You a temp worker?

90
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,168
Yeah, Wades, Mike Wades.

91
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,236
Oh.

92
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:14,973
Yeah, here ya are.

93
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,243
All right man,
just head up there.

94
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,912
Cheers, man.

95
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,051
You guys are here because some
bigwig down at city hall

96
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,153
said I don't get a contract
unless I fulfill

97
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,155
some local hiring
mandate bullshit.

98
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,057
You guys aren't on my roster,

99
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,026
so if you ever wanna
see a paycheck,

100
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,328
don't lose your time card.

101
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,332
Now, everything you see
in here has gotta go.

102
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:44,435
If it's not supporting
something, rip it down.

103
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,205
If you got a question about
something, come find me.

104
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,973
Can't find me?

105
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,174
Rip it down.

106
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:54,078
While you're doing that,
demolition crew will be placing explosives

107
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,347
on the first, fourth,
and eighth floors,

108
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:58,116
so stay out of there.

109
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,985
Elevators are coming out
tomorrow, which reminds me,

110
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:02,620
the freight elevator
goes until five.

111
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:05,290
Use it till then.
After that, take the stairs.

112
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:07,992
The power's on until we're
finished, any questions?

113
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,260
Good.

114
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,580
Wade, Diaz, grab a sledgehammer.

115
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,951
Windows indoors, start from the
top and work your way down.

116
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,377
Hey.

117
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:03,348
- Hey, Dad.
- How you feeling, sweetheart?

118
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,415
Better.

119
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,317
A little tired.

120
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,519
Do you need anything?

121
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,623
I'm good, I'm good.

122
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,093
Here, have some water.

123
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:19,097
Okay.

124
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:28,239
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

125
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:32,176
Sure.

126
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:32,777
Wanna watch some
more of that movie,

127
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:34,679
before I gotta go to work?

128
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,481
We always watch this.

129
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,715
Yeah, but it's funny.

130
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,084
Used to like it as a kid.

131
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,186
Come on.

132
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,024
All right.

133
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,425
Here we go, movie time.

134
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:00,538
Good morning, sir.

135
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:02,673
- Hey, Emily.
- Hi.

136
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,543
Mr. Ericson, do you mind if
I speak with you for a moment?

137
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,047
Yeah, we're just
watching a movie.

138
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,182
Just give me a second? I just...

139
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,187
This is funny.

140
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,257
<i>Your teeth are so bad</i>

141
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,159
<i>whenever people wanna say hi
to you in the hallway</i>

142
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,494
<i>they wanna punch
you out of despair!</i>

143
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,364
Yeah.

144
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,167
You just get some sleep.

145
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,645
I'm sorry, Mr. Ericson, but...

146
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:44,816
this is gonna be my last
visit until I get paid.

147
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:47,218
Well, I'm waiting for the check
from the insurance company.

148
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,686
Once I get it, you'll
get your money.

149
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,655
I'm just, I am so sorry.

150
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,825
But I cannot come back here
until I get my money.

151
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:00,565
Okay, that's them.
Hold on a second.

152
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,632
Yeah, hello.

153
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:03,768
One second.

154
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,703
We'll work it out, don't worry.

155
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,105
It'll be fine.

156
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,608
Yeah, one second, one second.

157
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,812
Okay, hold on, hold on.

158
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,323
Okay, what do you
mean it's not covered?

159
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:26,974
<i>Your policy only covers</i>

160
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:28,626
<i>a portion of the treatments
with insurance money.</i>

161
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,795
Yeah, but that's what her
doctor recommended.

162
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:33,865
He said she's strong enough to
accept the transplant.

163
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:35,800
She can't do any
more chemotherapy.

164
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,635
She's very sick now.

165
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,737
<i> Yes, but because of</i>
<i>how they do this procedure,</i>

166
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,141
<i>we have to classify
it as experimental.</i>

167
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:47,145
<i>Your policy only covers
the first 50,000 dollars.</i>

168
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,380
Okay, so, uh,

169
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,516
how much is it gonna cost?

170
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:53,885
What do I have to pay?

171
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:55,720
<i>Well, your portion of the bill</i>

172
00:15:55,722 --> 00:16:00,291
<i>would be approximately
400,000 dollars.</i>

173
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,263
<i>Mr. Ericson, are
you still there?</i>

174
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,798
But, there's gotta be
something else, right?

175
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,769
Like, my house isn't
even worth that much.

176
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:14,705
There's gotta be like
a supplemental policy

177
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,440
or something, right?

178
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,344
<i>Mr. Ericson, I'm really sorry,</i>

179
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,647
<i>but this is
the policy you have.</i>

180
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,384
Okay, thanks.

181
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:27,685
I'll figure something out.

182
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,408
Come on, take me back
to my block, huh?

183
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,377
Lando,
got your ticket to east block.

184
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,680
Some people over there wanna
have a word with you.

185
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:00,985
Fuck you, man.

186
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:04,555
This is bullshit.
I wanna talk to Ericson, you hear me?

187
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:05,623
Forget Ericson.

188
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:07,558
His daughter has cancer.

189
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,460
He's gonna be busy
with her funeral.

190
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:11,629
You'll be dealing with me now.

191
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,848
You owe Damien Glass some money.

192
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:32,617
Look, I don't want no problems.

193
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:34,552
I ain't got nothin'
to do with that.

194
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:39,890
Where's your fucking money?

195
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,421
Hey, hey, break it up!

196
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,085
Mayor's gonna speak.

197
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,821
How do you know that?

198
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:45,990
I was just down there.

199
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,733
Wade, Diaz!

200
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,502
What the hell
are you guys doing?

201
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,770
Nothin', we ain't doin' nothin'.

202
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,505
Yeah, no shit.

203
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:03,040
Listen, all the metal,

204
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:06,544
copper, aluminum, needs to be
separated. This is important.

205
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:08,446
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it, we
got it, no problem.

206
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:11,082
And somebody took some
fruit off of a spread

207
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:12,550
we set up for the mayor.

208
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:15,419
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would ya?

209
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:16,487
Mm-mm.

210
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,692
Oh by the way, I didn't get
a chance to say before,

211
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,561
but I really appreciate
the opportunity.

212
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:24,862
You know, I really needed this.

213
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,130
Then get to it.

214
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:29,033
We ain't paying you
two to dick around.

215
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:39,643
How much fruit can
a mayor eat, huh?

216
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,913
Here.

217
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,383
<i> I've heard it said</i>
<i>the Castle Heights hospital</i>

218
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,385
<i>is a reflection of
the neighborhood.</i>

219
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,921
But to see it in
its current state of decay,

220
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,991
and to equate it with the people
of this community,

221
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:56,527
is to do them a
great disservice.

222
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:03,000
I too was born inside the
segregated walls of this building,

223
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,669
but we're not here
to dwell on the past.

224
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:08,873
Not when there's work to be
done for our future.

225
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,476
It's with that work in mind

226
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:15,946
that I stand before you today
and humbly ask

227
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,849
for your support, as
I run for reelection.

228
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,486
<i>The
city of Birmingham is partnering</i>

229
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:25,990
<i>with some of the finest
businesses in the world,</i>

230
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:30,694
<i>to create a new commercial
district right here.</i>

231
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,031
<i>We ain't going anywhere.</i>

232
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:36,600
<i>We're here
to better ourselves.</i>

233
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:40,438
<i>We're here to better
Birmingham, Alabama.</i>

234
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,542
<i>This Sunday, the Castle falls!</i>

235
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,710
Hey, guard.

236
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:48,078
Let me talk to the lieutenant.

237
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,582
Hey, you hear me?
Let me talk to Ericson!

238
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,984
Hey, let me talk to Ericson!

239
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,866
You better have something
real important to tell me.

240
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:10,835
I got a proposition for you.

241
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:12,736
Move me back to south block.

242
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,674
They gonna kill me if you don't.

243
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,709
I'm sorry, I don't make
deals with inmates.

244
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,177
Take it up with the warden.

245
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,946
You know I can't trust
nobody else in here.

246
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,247
I need you to hear me out.

247
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:26,550
- Okay, we're done here.
- Look, it's money in it for you.

248
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:29,854
I'm talking a lot of money.

249
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:32,756
I'm trying to help you out.
You got a family, don't you?

250
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:33,924
Don't talk about my family.

251
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,375
You got a daughter, right?

252
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,727
I know you wanna help
your daughter out, right?

253
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,778
Don't you fucking mention my daughter!
Don't you talk about my fucking daughter!

254
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,830
Get the fuck off of me.

255
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,867
Shut the fuck up,
motherfucker, shut up!

256
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:44,668
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

257
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,704
You don't talk about my family,
you understand?

258
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:47,972
...man, I'm telling you.

259
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,540
Don't
mention my family!

260
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,883
I just found out.

261
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,953
Why would Ericson move him
back to south block?

262
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,522
What's he give a shit?

263
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:07,725
Didn't think he would, based on
how their little powwow played out.

264
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,093
So why move him, then?

265
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:11,845
Unless he's getting paid off,
and that was all a show for the camera.

266
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:14,598
Ericson never struck me
as the bribe-able type.

267
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,666
Never can tell.

268
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,236
You know, he's the only reason

269
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:21,171
Lando ain't dead
in the first place.

270
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:25,009
And I hear that he needs a lot of
money for his daughter's surgery.

271
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,811
Something like 400 grand.

272
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,752
He's getting paid by Lando?

273
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,822
That's my money payin' him.

274
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,560
Who's got my outside line?

275
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,564
Time to let my brother loose.

276
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:49,967
Ericson wants to pull strings?

277
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,803
Let's pull some fuckin' strings.

278
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:56,040
Let's pull some strings.

279
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,309
I'll be back, and
don't forget me.

280
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,011
Hey, Deacon.

281
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:02,179
We got a problem.

282
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,095
Come on.

283
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:29,940
So how'd it go?

284
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:32,042
Tested 90 percent pure.

285
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,711
Saved 50 grand, too.

286
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:37,247
Your brother needs to
upgrade his suppliers.

287
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:42,286
You gonna tell him they were
outbid by some Mexicans?

288
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,792
You see, my brother...

289
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:49,960
Mm-hm?

290
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,762
He's a victim of
his own ideology.

291
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,199
Me, on the other hand...

292
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:57,734
Mm-hm?

293
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:00,270
Only thing I care about
is money and power.

294
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,872
Mmm.

295
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:09,680
He just called.

296
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:11,415
Little problem we
gotta take care of.

297
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,218
We're getting rich, baby.

298
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:25,922
<i>The president spoke today</i>

299
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,924
<i>with France's prime minister
after the incident.</i>

300
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:30,461
<i>In other news, a New
Jersey case is now...</i>

301
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,075
Shh.

302
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,812
You wanna make a deal, Lando?
Start talking.

303
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:50,848
Tell me everything.

304
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:55,085
Look, Damian's moving dope up
and down the highway,

305
00:25:55,354 --> 00:25:57,454
and maybe he's getting tipped
at checkpoints, I don't know.

306
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,324
But he started making detours
through the hospital park,

307
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,426
and he and everybody knows

308
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,294
the park belong to me.

309
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,964
So you stole his money and
now he wants you dead?

310
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:09,166
Shoot that, plus his money back.

311
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:10,801
How much?

312
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:13,437
Three million, cash.

313
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:15,773
Yeah.

314
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:17,541
Look.

315
00:26:18,511 --> 00:26:19,777
If I can't get it,

316
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:22,246
I want something for it.

317
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:24,948
Move me back to south block.

318
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,317
All right, done.

319
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,286
Where's the money now?

320
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,356
Castle Falls Hospital.

321
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:37,327
<i>Now we're turning it
over to our weather.</i>

322
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:41,965
<i>We have some low
clouds around today.</i>

323
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,200
<i>Expect clouds to thin out...</i>

324
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:47,337
Hey, Deacon.

325
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,207
Think I know where your
brother's money is.

326
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:00,818
There ya are.

327
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,490
'Sup?

328
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:09,092
Hoo.

329
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:12,529
You know, I used to
live here, you know?

330
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:15,432
You used to live here?
I thought it was a hospital.

331
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:17,401
Mm, children's
residential center.

332
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:20,571
This floor and the seventh,
in the tower, yeah.

333
00:27:20,573 --> 00:27:23,040
It was kinda like an orphanage
for kids whose parents died,

334
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,107
or went to jail.

335
00:27:24,844 --> 00:27:26,343
Not my mom, though, no. She, uh,

336
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:28,278
she just worked all
the time, never home,

337
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,447
so judge decided it
was better for me

338
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:33,250
to spend more time here than,
you know, by myself.

339
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,252
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

340
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:37,855
I had no idea that
they could do that.

341
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:40,190
Neither did she.

342
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:43,894
This place was kinda
like a spot for kids

343
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:45,295
who were waiting to
get into foster care,

344
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:49,132
but really it was for the kids
that got kicked out.

345
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:53,637
Two years, yep.

346
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:00,444
You know, I could go home on the weekends,
but those kids did not like that.

347
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,112
Mexican kid with a deal?

348
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,648
Used to beat my ass
every chance they got.

349
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,958
Fuck this place.

350
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,360
I would've knocked
it down for free.

351
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:20,397
- I'm Mike.
- George.

352
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,966
- How you doing?
- Good.

353
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:26,303
Yeah, they were saying
the elevators are out.

354
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,339
Keeps you fit though, right?

355
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:30,407
I guess.

356
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:33,477
So what's up with you, man?

357
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:35,145
What's up with that accent,
where you from?

358
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:37,281
Me, I'm from Birmingham.

359
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:40,417
You know, the one in
the UK, the original.

360
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:43,053
What the hell are you doing over here?

361
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:46,623
I've been asking myself the same
thing, to be honest.

362
00:28:46,625 --> 00:28:48,992
You ever hear of Paramount Gym?

363
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:52,362
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
the MMA... the MMA gym.

364
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,097
The one in Atlanta
with all the champions.

365
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,599
That's the one, I
trained there, yeah.

366
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:57,935
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

367
00:28:58,304 --> 00:28:59,603
I've seen you before, man.

368
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:03,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I knew you looked familiar, man, yeah!

369
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,275
You... I saw your fight

370
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:07,277
- at the convention center, dude.
- You saw me fight?

371
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,379
Yeah, you knocked the
hell outta the guy,

372
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,381
the mean ugly guy
with the mohawk.

373
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:15,018
Oh that guy, yeah, yeah, real nice
piece of work. You saw that fight?

374
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,086
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

375
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,689
- Knocked him out with a spin kick, right?
- Yeah, I remember.

376
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:20,290
Oh man.

377
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,692
<i>I can't believe
you saw that fight.</i>

378
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:07,504
<i> He got ya.</i>

379
00:30:07,606 --> 00:30:09,172
<i> I got it.</i>

380
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:14,311
Not a contender.

381
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,783
You know, I'm starting
to like this stuff.

382
00:30:52,785 --> 00:30:55,084
No you don't, since when?

383
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,386
Since you play it all the time.
You know, but I prefer the classics.

384
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:00,090
Biggie, Tupac, they
were, you know, poets.

385
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:02,626
I don't understand what these new
guys are saying half the time.

386
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:04,294
Don't worry, I'll teach you.

387
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,797
- This is one of my favorites.
- Oh yeah?

388
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:21,211
Dad!

389
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,480
Oh shit, I'm sorry.

390
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:25,115
Are you okay?

391
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:26,683
Yeah, yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

392
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,351
Can you, uh,

393
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,655
can you ask Leah to come
over this afternoon?

394
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,690
'Cause I gotta do some stuff
with work, you know?

395
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:36,760
- I may be late.
- I can be at home one night by myself.

396
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:40,330
Yeah, but she wanted to see you,
and I.

397
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:42,632
- Okay, I will.
- All right.

398
00:31:42,835 --> 00:31:44,701
Whoa.

399
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:46,703
Okay.

400
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,371
Just the way she
used to make it.

401
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:52,509
I miss Mom so much.

402
00:31:55,547 --> 00:31:58,181
Yeah.

403
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,449
Yeah, I miss her too.

404
00:32:02,855 --> 00:32:04,354
She'd be so proud of you.

405
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:11,828
Like it?

406
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:14,264
It's good.

407
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:16,600
Everything's gonna
be fine, don't worry.

408
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:25,242
So what are
you doing after this?

409
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:27,711
I don't know, man.
Try and get in somewhere, I guess.

410
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:29,312
Depends who's hiring.

411
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:30,580
What, you got something?

412
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:33,199
I just meant like, today.

413
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,719
A bunch of us are gonna go down to the
bar and watch this place come down on TV.

414
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:36,786
Oh yeah, sure man.

415
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,121
Sorry, I thought you meant you
had a lead on a job or something.

416
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,456
- I mean, actually I might.
- Yeah?

417
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:43,792
It seems legit, just didn't know
if you'd be interested, you know?

418
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,830
Hey listen, mate.
If the money's real, I'm interested.

419
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:49,332
Dump everything down
the elevator shaft.

420
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,800
They're rigging charges
in the compactor.

421
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:05,549
They're behind schedule.

422
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:12,923
There's 12 floors,
100 plus rooms.

423
00:33:12,925 --> 00:33:14,958
The longer they take,
the less time we have.

424
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,594
Leave it to my brother to wait
till the last possible minute.

425
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,231
Everybody sit tight.

426
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,365
We'll go in when they clear out.

427
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,270
- I hate playing up this family shit.
- I know.

428
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:29,339
It's bad enough I gotta
clear up his mistakes.

429
00:33:31,944 --> 00:33:33,210
Fuck my brother.

430
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:34,711
- Hmm.
- That money's ours.

431
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:36,513
I love it when you're selfish.

432
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:38,215
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

433
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:46,423
We're done here.
We'll clear out once they set the charges.

434
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:48,825
That means hard out by two PM,
so let's pick up the pace.

435
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:51,528
Okay, come on.

436
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,396
What's the catch?

437
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,464
It's in Alaska.

438
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,600
Oh, no shit.

439
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:59,236
Yeah. What? Come on
man, it could be fun.

440
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:00,870
Alaska, though?

441
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,240
Yeah, yeah.
You know what it is?

442
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,942
- They got beautiful women in Alaska, man.
- Yeah, sure.

443
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:07,477
They got moose and shit, too.

444
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,678
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

445
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,879
Have you ever even seen a moose?

446
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,282
Hell no, but that's
why I wanna go.

447
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:13,617
- I bet you do.
- Yeah.

448
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:15,418
Get some of that moose meat,

449
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,921
and then you give it to one of
those Eskimo chicks.

450
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:19,856
Then she loves you forever.

451
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,858
They do... they do
the Eskimo thing.

452
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,727
I don't know, I don't know,
we should check it out.

453
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,463
I mean, it's worth checking out.

454
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:27,597
- All right, ready?
- Yeah.

455
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,267
Three, two, one, go.

456
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:35,705
Woo-hoo.

457
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,641
No, but it's gonna be
a good opportunity, really.

458
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:38,975
A lotta good money here, man.

459
00:34:38,977 --> 00:34:40,677
Lotta money to be
made in Alaska.

460
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:41,878
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

461
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:05,835
So what about you
man, you got any kids?

462
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:09,839
No, man. What about you?

463
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:12,842
Yeah, two of 'em.

464
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:14,844
But they're at school right now,

465
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:18,448
so their mom won't care if I
go have a drink at this party.

466
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:38,735
It's time to get outta here.

467
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:42,072
Hey man, you comin'?

468
00:35:42,074 --> 00:35:44,708
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
comin', comin'.

469
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,350
- Yeah, let's go man.
- Yeah.

470
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,588
- What's wrong?
- Nothin'.

471
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:00,490
Let's go.

472
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:05,095
All right, gentlemen,
say your goodbyes.

473
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,598
That's all she wrote.

474
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,066
It's time to go.

475
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,006
Good, keep moving.

476
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,376
Keep moving.

477
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:22,445
Wade, Diaz, let's go!

478
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:29,452
Thank you, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

479
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:32,389
Absolutely.

480
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:36,726
It's beer 30, gentlemen.

481
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:37,794
Enjoy yourselves.

482
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:40,930
Come on, come on, come on.

483
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,769
Come on guys, you wanna get
left here and get blown up?

484
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,706
Some of us have
families to get home to.

485
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,108
Not all of us have
appointments with bar stools.

486
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:21,905
Babysitter's here.

487
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:28,178
My brother sends his regards.

488
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,713
You have some big shoes to fill.
He was a visionary.

489
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,916
Yeah, well he'll be glad to know
that you were here today

490
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:33,983
to help me right this wrong.

491
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:36,920
The spirit of what he created

492
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,855
is alive and well
in this very room.

493
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:41,858
Three million dollars,

494
00:37:42,194 --> 00:37:44,794
in a building that's gonna be
dust inside three hours.

495
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,131
We don't know where it is.

496
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:51,134
We don't have time
to go looking for it.

497
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:54,604
We're looking for the man that
betrayed this family.

498
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,474
Put my brother's life in danger.

499
00:37:58,143 --> 00:37:59,175
Follow the guard,

500
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:02,745
find the money.

501
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,501
What the hell are you doing?

502
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:34,544
Like your opinions.

503
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:36,579
Like, actually, yeah...

504
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:38,581
- Kinda like him.
- Yeah.

505
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:39,983
But they have good songs, too.

506
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:41,584
I would listen to emo music.

507
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:43,086
That stuff is
sometimes really funny.

508
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:44,521
Yeah.

509
00:38:58,003 --> 00:38:59,536
The rap is better there.

510
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:02,639
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

511
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:05,708
- Bye, Dad.
- All right, see you soon.

512
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,011
But yeah, I think
this one's good.

513
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,279
Yeah, play that jam.

514
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:14,784
Good to see ya.
How are ya, okay, how are ya?

515
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,803
Look at this here.

516
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:19,989
We're gonna have lots of
activity over here.

517
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,623
This is all gonna come down.

518
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,258
We'll have a nice big
civic center here.

519
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,728
It won't even matter, because we're
not gonna do what you did last time.

520
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,564
I'm not doing that man, I'm not.

521
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:30,066
I'm telling you, man,
you and all the shots.

522
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,101
It was your idea.

523
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,003
- Hey, George.
- Yeah?

524
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,939
I think I'm gonna
pass on that drink.

525
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,841
- Are you serious?
- Yeah man, I'm tired.

526
00:39:38,977 --> 00:39:40,909
Don't act like you got something
better to do, man.

527
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,844
Come on, we're all gonna go.
Everybody's gonna have a good time.

528
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,113
- Ah, shit.
- What?

529
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:47,784
- I left my jacket.
- Oh, forget the jacket.

530
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:50,186
I can't forget my jacket,
the punch card's inside my jacket pocket.

531
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:51,721
I've gotta go back and get it.

532
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,872
Are you serious? Wait, wait, wait, we'll
all go with you. We'll all go with you.

533
00:39:53,874 --> 00:39:56,024
No, don't make a
big thing out of it.

534
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,843
- Hey, what's the hold up?
- What're you waiting for?

535
00:39:57,845 --> 00:39:59,662
Punch out already!

536
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:01,663
Listen to me, get the beers,
and I know where the jacket is.

537
00:40:01,665 --> 00:40:03,665
- I'll see you in a minute.
- You sure?

538
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:05,335
Yeah man,
I'm good. I'm good.

539
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,139
Be careful.

540
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:14,243
<i>...heard it
said the Castle Heights Hospital</i>

541
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,613
<i>is a reflection of
the neighborhood.</i>

542
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:21,684
<i>But to equate it with the
people of this neighborhood...</i>

543
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,366
<i>Attention. Clear the area.</i>

544
00:40:36,368 --> 00:40:39,636
<i>We have 90 minutes till
detonation, clear the area.</i>

545
00:40:41,373 --> 00:40:43,106
<i>Attention. Clear the area.</i>

546
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:46,209
<i>We have 90 minutes 'til
detonation, clear the area.</i>

547
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:49,979
<i>Attention. Clear the area.</i>

548
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:31,087
He's goin' in.

549
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:02,145
Afternoon.

550
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:04,180
Can I help you?

551
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:07,250
Asbestos disposal.

552
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:12,455
Yeah, I don't think so.

553
00:43:12,857 --> 00:43:14,323
We're locked up, guys.

554
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,259
I mean, this place is gonna
be toast at five.

555
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:17,960
Are you sure you got
the right building?

556
00:43:18,496 --> 00:43:20,296
Sure as eggs is eggs.

557
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,801
All right, well,
let me check first.

558
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:26,903
Mmm, uh-uh.

559
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,339
Oops, give me the keys.

560
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,075
Right there on my hip, sir.
Just, please.

561
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:36,479
Why don't you find a comfy place
for our friend here?

562
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:38,714
Okay.

563
00:43:38,716 --> 00:43:40,016
All right guys,
we gotta get inside.

564
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,184
Back the truck up.

565
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:44,887
Get in.

566
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:47,290
What, do you see
my hands right now?

567
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:49,091
They took my keys.
What do you want me to do?

568
00:43:53,031 --> 00:43:54,363
Somebody pop this trunk!

569
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:56,999
Hey, wait a minute.

570
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:58,100
I know you.

571
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,170
Yeah, you used to dance

572
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:03,873
over at Frisky's on
Route 22, didn't you?

573
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,575
Just get everything prepped,

574
00:44:05,577 --> 00:44:06,943
100 percent.

575
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,079
I'm right, ain't I?

576
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:12,481
I couldn't forget a scar like
that, sweetheart.

577
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:14,417
Damn.

578
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:24,894
He recognized you.

579
00:44:24,896 --> 00:44:26,195
What was I supposed to do?

580
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:33,302
All right.

581
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:35,271
Help me out.

582
00:44:57,629 --> 00:44:59,295
Yes!

583
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:01,530
Fuck, yes, come on!

584
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,663
Shit.

585
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:48,577
Did you see where he went in?

586
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,646
Over there.
He's headed for the lobby.

587
00:45:51,149 --> 00:45:53,316
All right, go check around back.
Manny, go with him.

588
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:55,084
Everybody else, with me.

589
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:57,987
Let's go get this guy.

590
00:46:29,053 --> 00:46:30,453
This is the fun part.

591
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:32,088
There's no elevators.

592
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:34,256
We got nothing.

593
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,993
Fuck it,
pick a floor and search it.

594
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,461
The money's here somewhere.

595
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,062
So is the guard.

596
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:42,331
All right, James.
Take the back stairs.

597
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:43,733
Caleb, circle the building.

598
00:46:43,735 --> 00:46:45,134
Nobody gets out.

599
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:46,302
Duke, you stay here.

600
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,004
You see something,
you put it on the radio.

601
00:46:48,006 --> 00:46:49,338
Eyes and ears open, guys.

602
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:52,508
Kat and Eddie, you're with me.

603
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:53,609
Let's move.

604
00:48:50,194 --> 00:48:53,329
Spread out, find the money.

605
00:48:53,331 --> 00:48:54,864
Everybody, now.

606
00:49:10,348 --> 00:49:11,413
Damn it.

607
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:16,285
Get over here,
let me know if you see something.

608
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,319
Move, move!

609
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:24,226
Wait, did you hear that?

610
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,830
Eighth floor, now.

611
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:32,801
What the hell?

612
00:49:36,908 --> 00:49:38,307
Go!

613
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:06,235
What's going on?

614
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:07,937
Search this floor.
We're gonna take the ninth.

615
00:50:07,939 --> 00:50:10,573
Yo, you know the whole building's

616
00:50:10,575 --> 00:50:11,941
wired with explosives, right?

617
00:50:11,943 --> 00:50:13,309
Yeah, boss.

618
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:50,846
Shit.

619
00:50:50,848 --> 00:50:51,981
What happened?

620
00:50:51,983 --> 00:50:53,249
He got the money.

621
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:55,884
Oh, your brother's
gonna be pissed.

622
00:50:56,721 --> 00:50:57,920
It's gotta be in here.

623
00:51:33,357 --> 00:51:35,457
Everybody listen up.

624
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:36,558
Nothing changes.

625
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,762
<i>Spread out, nobody leaves
until we find it.</i>

626
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:40,829
Copy that.

627
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:59,381
<i> Got him,</i>
<i>he's down by the trash room.</i>

628
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:00,449
On my way.

629
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,721
Go, go, go, we got him, outside.

630
00:52:11,896 --> 00:52:12,961
You got the wrong guy.

631
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,679
I don't know who you guys are
looking for, but I'm not him.

632
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:16,398
Shut the fuck up!

633
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,034
We caught this rat lurking.

634
00:52:19,036 --> 00:52:21,070
What are you doing lurking
around here after hours?

635
00:52:21,072 --> 00:52:22,338
Get the fuck up.

636
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:25,808
I work here, I'm
part of the crew.

637
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,776
I left my punch card
inside, that's it.

638
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:30,412
Oh, well looky here.

639
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:33,415
Hmm. Where's the fucking money?

640
00:52:33,417 --> 00:52:34,650
I don't know
anything about that.

641
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:36,018
I don't know anything
about any money.

642
00:52:37,722 --> 00:52:40,522
Caleb, who is he?

643
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:41,757
Never seen him before.

644
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:48,263
Hey.

645
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:49,565
Where's Ericson?
He ain't with the guard.

646
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:50,632
This guy's a nobody.

647
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:53,035
Yeah.

648
00:52:53,037 --> 00:52:55,838
He knows something, don't ya,
ain't that right?

649
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,972
I don't know anything, man.

650
00:52:56,974 --> 00:52:58,841
Just let me go, please,
just let me outta here.

651
00:52:58,843 --> 00:52:59,975
Shh.

652
00:53:00,478 --> 00:53:01,777
Come on, man.

653
00:53:06,584 --> 00:53:07,716
I got a better idea.

654
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:09,918
Manny.

655
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:36,845
- No!
- There.

656
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:38,113
- Eighth floor.
- Yeah, go.

657
00:53:38,115 --> 00:53:39,548
Take front, I'll cut him off.

658
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:44,453
Go get him.

659
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:46,088
Take the trash room,
I'll get the lobby.

660
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:15,083
Fuck!

661
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:22,524
On eighth.

662
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:38,173
Shit!

663
00:54:40,544 --> 00:54:41,877
Come on, then.

664
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:02,224
Hi there.

665
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:11,934
We got the motherfucker.

666
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:14,102
<i>He killed Manny.</i>

667
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:19,675
Bring him down here, alive please.

668
00:56:20,778 --> 00:56:21,977
Make this easy.

669
00:56:22,146 --> 00:56:23,612
Tell us where the
fuckin' money is.

670
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:25,113
Yeah, maybe we'll let you go.

671
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:29,217
Spoiler alert, maybe we don't.

672
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,321
Okay, okay, okay, just... just...
just calm down, all right?

673
00:56:32,323 --> 00:56:34,856
I can take you there,
I can take you to the money, but...

674
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:44,800
Fuck, are you trying to
blow this place up?

675
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:46,201
Get your fucking hands off me.

676
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:47,736
Don't ever touch me again.

677
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:07,022
Fuck.

678
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:12,661
Take it easy, cowboy.

679
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:15,797
I don't see him.

680
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:19,267
There's nothin' down here
but a bunch of damn dynamite.

681
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:22,404
I'll go check the back way.

682
00:57:27,711 --> 00:57:29,244
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

683
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:31,380
What are you doing here?
Who are you?

684
00:57:31,382 --> 00:57:33,115
I'm with the demo team, okay?
I work here.

685
00:57:34,251 --> 00:57:35,317
Where's the money?

686
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:38,035
- What money?
- Bullshit!

687
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
listen, listen, listen,

688
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:41,723
I left my punch card in my
jacket upstairs, all right?

689
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:42,858
I came back here to get it.

690
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:44,960
I'm not with these guys, okay?

691
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:46,995
They killed my friend,
and they're trying to kill...

692
00:57:46,997 --> 00:57:48,263
Okay.

693
00:57:48,265 --> 00:57:50,098
So you know what they'll do
if they find us.

694
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:52,134
Okay.

695
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:53,802
Stay cool, all right?

696
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,075
Okay, we're gettin' out of here.

697
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,749
Stop it, stop it!

698
00:58:55,332 --> 00:58:56,865
I got 'em.

699
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:58,266
Trash room.

700
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,202
Okay.

701
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:03,438
- Hey, hey, take it easy.
- Hey, don't move.

702
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,373
Look, you hit the dynamite,

703
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,842
you'll bring this
whole place down.

704
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:08,076
He ain't lying,
mate, look around.

705
00:59:08,078 --> 00:59:09,911
Back up, back the fuck up!

706
00:59:09,913 --> 00:59:11,079
Be real smart about this, kid.

707
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:12,930
- What did I just say?
- Now listen to me, listen,

708
00:59:12,932 --> 00:59:14,782
just put the gun
down, all right?

709
00:59:14,785 --> 00:59:16,184
You got us, no one's
going anywhere.

710
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:18,487
Somebody hurry down to
the trash room, quick.

711
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:23,358
I'm gonna need some help.

712
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:25,427
Help!

713
00:59:49,386 --> 00:59:50,886
Stop.

714
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:52,287
They'll be here any second!

715
00:59:54,992 --> 00:59:56,525
Are you crazy?

716
00:59:56,527 --> 00:59:59,361
Am I the only one that gets how
dynamite works around here?

717
00:59:59,363 --> 01:00:00,428
Go!

718
01:00:05,803 --> 01:00:08,036
Thank you, thank you, it's a
pleasure to meet you, sir, all right.

719
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,023
I got him.

720
01:00:28,025 --> 01:00:29,558
Two guys, back staircase.

721
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,959
<i>I'll cover the outside.</i>

722
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:57,352
Block all the exits.
Nobody gets out 'til we've got the money.

723
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:00,455
Get up there!

724
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:02,190
Deacon, I think I got
a concussion or something.

725
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:03,592
I look like I give a fuck?

726
01:01:03,594 --> 01:01:05,260
Get your ass up there!

727
01:01:20,477 --> 01:01:22,410
Listen up, both of you!

728
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:26,047
I'm gonna give you one chance to
get out of this alive.

729
01:01:27,217 --> 01:01:28,583
Trust me on that.

730
01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:31,186
You throw the money down,

731
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:33,588
we leave,

732
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:35,290
you can leave.

733
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:38,960
Gonna count to three.

734
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,030
Then this offer goes away.

735
01:01:45,402 --> 01:01:46,501
One!

736
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,545
Two!

737
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:04,452
Three!

738
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:09,658
Hey, don't shoot me, asshole.

739
01:02:22,673 --> 01:02:24,039
This fucking guy.

740
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:34,215
Miss me?

741
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:38,453
Where's the fucking money?

742
01:02:44,528 --> 01:02:45,593
Make a deal.

743
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:49,197
Tell me where the fucking money is,
and I'll hold your hand when you die.

744
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,466
Hey!

745
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:08,750
200 meters away, Mr. Mayor,
just to be safe.

746
01:03:47,391 --> 01:03:49,024
They never leave this shit hole.

747
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,030
We bury them here.

748
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,436
Holy shit.

749
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:09,543
Let's go.

750
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:10,411
Okay, let's go.
They know we're here.

751
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,784
Hey, hey, I'm on your side.

752
01:04:15,786 --> 01:04:17,719
I don't remember asking for your
help, mate.

753
01:04:20,824 --> 01:04:22,190
Wanna tell me
where the money is?

754
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,492
- What money?
- You know what I'm talking about.

755
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:25,727
Hey, cut the bullshit!

756
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:27,429
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

757
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:29,597
You're bleeding.

758
01:04:30,634 --> 01:04:31,699
You're bleeding.

759
01:04:32,402 --> 01:04:33,468
All right?

760
01:04:35,772 --> 01:04:36,838
Come on, in here.

761
01:04:38,508 --> 01:04:39,641
Come on!

762
01:04:42,779 --> 01:04:44,312
So, who are these guys?

763
01:04:47,284 --> 01:04:48,716
Paramilitary group.

764
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:51,152
Call themselves
the Five Families.

765
01:04:51,822 --> 01:04:55,090
The guy with the tattoo
on his neck is Deacon Glass.

766
01:04:55,525 --> 01:04:57,625
He runs things for
his brother in prison.

767
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:00,628
So how do you fit into this?

768
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:02,363
I'm a guard there.

769
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,166
Glass tried to kill
this other inmate,

770
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:06,801
a drug dealer by the name
of Lando Collins.

771
01:05:06,803 --> 01:05:08,870
Claims Collins stole
a bunch of his money.

772
01:05:09,306 --> 01:05:10,872
Stashed it in here somewhere.

773
01:05:11,808 --> 01:05:14,542
Okay, so you just
figured you'd come here

774
01:05:14,544 --> 01:05:17,512
and take it, is that it?

775
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:19,647
- Is that why you're here?
- Yeah, something like that.

776
01:05:20,183 --> 01:05:21,449
What about you?

777
01:05:22,686 --> 01:05:25,520
Like I said, I just work here.

778
01:05:36,733 --> 01:05:38,366
We're heading down to nine.

779
01:05:38,368 --> 01:05:40,367
<i> Look, you're not</i>
<i>getting out of here alone,</i>

780
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:42,369
and I'm not leaving
without the money.

781
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:44,205
So cut the shit,
tell me where it is.

782
01:05:44,207 --> 01:05:46,774
Fuck you, mate, right?
Buy a ticket and get in line.

783
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,476
No one's forcing you
to be here, are they?

784
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:49,777
All right, asshole.

785
01:05:50,347 --> 01:05:51,880
What's the plan,
how are we getting out of here?

786
01:05:51,882 --> 01:05:53,314
Does it look like I got a plan?

787
01:05:53,884 --> 01:05:55,883
Haven't thought that
far ahead, okay?

788
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:57,885
Can't remember the reason I'm
in this shit in the first place.

789
01:06:04,227 --> 01:06:05,293
Oh.

790
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:10,431
One of 'em's hurt.

791
01:06:10,534 --> 01:06:12,167
Where the
fuck is he, then?

792
01:06:14,237 --> 01:06:15,503
Hey are we losing?

793
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:17,438
'Cause it really feels
like we're losing.

794
01:06:17,774 --> 01:06:20,208
And isn't this damn building
gonna blow up soon?

795
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:22,009
Shut up!

796
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:23,811
See, why you gotta talk
to me like that, James?

797
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:27,315
How do you feel about
killing somebody?

798
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:31,219
'Cause us getting out of here's
pretty goddamn dependent on it.

799
01:06:32,189 --> 01:06:33,821
Pretty sure I already
did kill someone.

800
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,924
Kicked some bloke down
the elevator shaft.

801
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,526
Can't find 'em anywhere.

802
01:06:38,528 --> 01:06:39,894
There's too many
places to hide in here.

803
01:06:39,896 --> 01:06:41,529
<i>What do you want me
to tell you, man?</i>

804
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:43,765
They're sitting on my money,
they've got it!

805
01:06:43,767 --> 01:06:47,468
You need to find
them! Fucking go, now!

806
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:49,853
Let's go.

807
01:06:49,855 --> 01:06:51,905
Fuck 'em, if they wanna play
hide and seek, then let 'em.

808
01:06:52,209 --> 01:06:53,775
We need to get the
hell outta here.

809
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:55,443
Let's go.

810
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:58,846
Kiss my ass, old
man, I'm leaving.

811
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:01,349
You're not gonna get very far
with that attitude.

812
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,383
Whatever!

813
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:07,522
- I need a gun.
- Hey wait, wait, wait.

814
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:31,512
Hey, what'd I tell...

815
01:07:32,315 --> 01:07:33,414
Fuck!

816
01:07:33,984 --> 01:07:35,699
- Put it down!
- Shoot him.

817
01:07:35,701 --> 01:07:37,417
- Don't do it, I'll kill you!
- I said shoot him!

818
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,027
Maybe I should hold onto that.

819
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:49,264
Move!

820
01:07:52,469 --> 01:07:53,668
You hold it.

821
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:56,904
Ah, ah, ah, hey.

822
01:07:58,041 --> 01:07:59,340
Come on, we need to move.

823
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:00,942
No, they followed you here,
didn't they, these guys?

824
01:08:00,944 --> 01:08:02,710
They came here
because of you, right?

825
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:04,479
Look, we gotta get moving.

826
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:07,448
No, I want you to tell me
what you're really doing here.

827
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:08,616
We don't have time
for this shit.

828
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:09,951
I wanna know now!

829
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:12,420
You tell me!

830
01:08:14,891 --> 01:08:15,957
Okay.

831
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:20,695
My daughter's very sick,
blood cancer, she's dying.

832
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:22,830
Now there's one way to save her.

833
01:08:22,832 --> 01:08:25,667
Either I'm leaving here with
enough money to pay for it,

834
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,036
or I'm staying here so
my life insurance will.

835
01:08:30,307 --> 01:08:31,406
That's hers.

836
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,013
<i>Who fired those shots?</i>

837
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:44,485
Shit.

838
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:48,690
I said, who fired those shots?

839
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:51,693
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

840
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:55,997
That guy you killed down there,
he was an innocent man.

841
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:03,137
Now you're gonna pay for that.

842
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,539
So if you want your money,
it's up here with me,

843
01:09:04,541 --> 01:09:06,874
<i>so come and fucking
get it, asshole!</i>

844
01:09:11,348 --> 01:09:12,380
Can we go now?

845
01:09:19,089 --> 01:09:20,588
Jesus Christ.

846
01:09:22,092 --> 01:09:23,358
Hey!

847
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:31,866
How about a heads up next time
you do something stupid?

848
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:33,768
Yeah, all right, heads up.

849
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:36,637
Look, you're gonna
get us both killed.

850
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:38,539
Look, are you coming or not?

851
01:10:02,465 --> 01:10:03,698
What's your daughter's name?

852
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,002
Emily.

853
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:09,804
Emily.

854
01:10:15,845 --> 01:10:17,294
Thanks.

855
01:10:17,296 --> 01:10:18,746
Yeah,
you just make sure she gets it.

856
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:21,816
20 minutes.

857
01:10:22,152 --> 01:10:23,684
Let's get out of here alive.

858
01:10:40,136 --> 01:10:41,202
What's going on?

859
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:46,674
<i>You know I used to live here.</i>

860
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,544
<i>I was there, I thought
it was awesome.</i>

861
01:10:49,546 --> 01:10:51,479
<i>You, I saw your fight!</i>

862
01:10:56,186 --> 01:10:58,519
You know I had 41
professional fights?

863
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:02,690
41 fights, and I can
count on one hand

864
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,693
the amount of times
somebody's recognized me.

865
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:08,129
They killed my friend.

866
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:13,734
All right.

867
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,870
If you don't get out of here
now, we're both gonna be dead.

868
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:17,605
Okay? Let's go.

869
01:11:18,808 --> 01:11:19,874
Come on.

870
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:39,994
How you doing, son?

871
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,801
You gotta
be kidding me.

872
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:02,183
They're headed back down.

873
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:04,819
Take the back, split up, go!

874
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:08,189
Jesus, how'd you plan
to carry all this?

875
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:10,057
I don't make plans.

876
01:12:11,861 --> 01:12:12,994
One second.

877
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,000
Hey, sweetheart.

878
01:12:19,002 --> 01:12:21,002
Where are you, still working?

879
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:23,237
<i>Yeah, you okay sweetheart?</i>

880
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:24,305
I'm fine.

881
01:12:24,307 --> 01:12:27,108
I'm, you know,
I'm in the middle of something.

882
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:29,277
I just, I gotta go
okay, I love you.

883
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:31,946
Wait, can Leah
stay over tonight?

884
01:12:32,148 --> 01:12:33,214
Sure.

885
01:12:33,216 --> 01:12:34,731
<i>We were
thinking to order Chinese.</i>

886
01:12:34,733 --> 01:12:36,249
<i>Do you want anything?</i>

887
01:12:36,553 --> 01:12:37,985
Um, okay.

888
01:12:38,288 --> 01:12:39,587
<i> Order me everything.</i>

889
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,022
<i>Okay, I love you, I gotta go.</i>

890
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:42,123
You sound weird, Dad.

891
01:12:42,225 --> 01:12:43,991
I'm fine, honey, okay?

892
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:46,060
Love you very much, I'll see you
soon, all right?

893
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:47,862
Bye.

894
01:12:48,164 --> 01:12:49,730
Bye.

895
01:12:55,038 --> 01:12:56,571
You know what?

896
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,040
I think I have got a plan.

897
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:02,743
Why do I have a bad
feeling about this?

898
01:13:05,582 --> 01:13:06,781
Here, all right.

899
01:13:08,284 --> 01:13:09,784
So this is what I'm thinking.

900
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:11,919
We throw the bags down there,

901
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:13,621
and then we climb
down the shaft.

902
01:13:13,623 --> 01:13:14,855
How do you know
they're not down there?

903
01:13:15,658 --> 01:13:17,692
I don't, okay, it's
a high risk plan.

904
01:13:20,196 --> 01:13:21,796
Jesus!

905
01:13:21,798 --> 01:13:22,930
- Goddamn it.
- Shit.

906
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:26,934
I don't think you
understand how plans work.

907
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:28,369
Then you've got a plan, have ya?

908
01:13:29,806 --> 01:13:31,005
There's a roof off
the sixth floor.

909
01:13:31,007 --> 01:13:33,207
We can get down from there.

910
01:13:33,209 --> 01:13:34,642
Shit, 10 minutes.

911
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:35,710
Shit, let's go!

912
01:13:35,712 --> 01:13:38,212
There's a roof off the
sixth floor, now he tells me.

913
01:13:47,323 --> 01:13:49,357
- They're on six.
- Fuck, they're heading for the roof.

914
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:51,025
Head for the roof, go, go!

915
01:13:56,366 --> 01:13:57,698
Can get out from there.

916
01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:01,302
Shit!

917
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,179
- Go!
- You go!

918
01:14:12,715 --> 01:14:13,981
Go on, I'll cover you!

919
01:14:15,985 --> 01:14:17,051
Go on, move!

920
01:14:33,336 --> 01:14:34,669
Shit, it's locked!

921
01:14:34,671 --> 01:14:38,172
We got 'em. Cut 'em off down
the back stairs, go now!

922
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,091
Come on, let's go!

923
01:15:04,033 --> 01:15:05,099
Come on.

924
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:12,707
We have four minutes, come on!

925
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:14,308
You go, just go!

926
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:19,947
You got someone
waiting for you, right?

927
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:22,383
Just get her the money, go!

928
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:23,918
Go!

929
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:35,796
What's the matter?

930
01:15:35,798 --> 01:15:36,931
Outta ammo?

931
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:47,007
You wanna tell me who you are
before I kill you?

932
01:15:48,144 --> 01:15:50,244
Maybe we'll just wait
till the whole place blows.

933
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:55,950
You may as well
give me my money.

934
01:15:55,952 --> 01:15:57,351
Might as well.

935
01:15:57,353 --> 01:15:59,086
Fuck.

936
01:16:58,214 --> 01:16:59,547
You guys ready to see this?

937
01:17:49,599 --> 01:17:50,865
It's over.

938
01:17:53,269 --> 01:17:54,902
<i>You don't have
the killer instinct.</i>

939
01:17:54,904 --> 01:17:55,970
<i>It's over.</i>

940
01:18:14,624 --> 01:18:16,557
We got less than
30 seconds, guys.

941
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:10,010
All right, all right. 10!

942
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,546
Damn it.

943
01:19:20,022 --> 01:19:21,088
Seven!

944
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:27,227
- Jump, jump!
- Five!

945
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,066
Shit!

946
01:19:34,036 --> 01:19:36,070
Three, two...

947
01:20:32,094 --> 01:20:33,227
Ericson, by the way.

948
01:20:36,632 --> 01:20:37,698
Mike.

949
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:43,303
Thanks, man.

950
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,540
What a fuckin' day.

951
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:52,146
Yeah, it was a
pretty messed up day.

952
01:21:30,152 --> 01:21:31,218
Mom?

953
01:23:10,786 --> 01:23:11,852
Get up.

954
01:23:13,522 --> 01:23:14,588
What is this?

955
01:23:21,263 --> 01:23:22,663
<i> And one more thing,</i>

956
01:23:24,533 --> 01:23:26,200
I want Damien Glass.

957
01:23:40,616 --> 01:23:41,982
What's going on?
Come on.

958
01:23:42,985 --> 01:23:44,518
What's going on?

959
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:45,719
All right, leave him.

960
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:48,689
Hey.

961
01:23:52,795 --> 01:23:53,860
Hey, what is this?

962
01:23:57,833 --> 01:23:59,299
Shh.

963
01:23:59,301 --> 01:24:01,268
- I didn't do nothin'.
- Shh.

964
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:02,603
- Wasn't me.
- Shh.

965
01:24:03,572 --> 01:24:05,272
Welcome to south
block, motherfucker.
