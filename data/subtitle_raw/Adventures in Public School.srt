1
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:33,299
I like to think
about the beginning
of the universe a lot.

2
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,301
A lot, a lot.

3
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:39,105
About how there's
ten trillion galaxies,

4
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:41,674
more stars than grains
of sand on the Earth,

5
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:46,346
how it's been around
for 13.82 billion years,
give or take.

6
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:49,215
So why does this stupid
little moment feel so big?

7
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,619
It's so small.

8
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,422
My first day
at public school.

9
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,590
That's my mom
holding my hand.

10
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,126
Are you sure we should
be holding hands?

11
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,729
-Yeah, yeah, obviously.
-Don't be nervous.

12
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,432
Let's go in. I'm freezing
my tits off out here.

13
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,566
Okay.

14
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,368
Big freaking exam day.

15
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,208
I don't know this yet,

16
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,445
but walking through
those doors is gonna
change my life forever,

17
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:22,248
like some supernova
explosion of love.

18
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:29,322
Wait.
Oh, that's a really
pretty image.

19
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:30,590
Rewind.

20
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,225
Let's go to
the beginning of me.

21
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:41,234

falls to the ground ♪

22
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:50,443

Hey, Liam.
Hey. Liam?

36
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,614
Okay,
what are your obstacles
for tomorrow's exam? Go.

37
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:04,617
Uh, sometimes I get lazy
with my handwriting
and my Y's look like J's.

38
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,419
-Yes.
-I can do better.
I can do better.

39
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,888
Mom, uh...
And I get nervous sweats.

40
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:10,790
Go to Cambridge,
study with Stephen Hawking,

41
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,426
become the second-most
famous astronomer
of all time.

42
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,794
Honey, I think you can
become most famous.

43
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,763
I mean,
it's Stephen Hawking,
come on.

44
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,531
Hot hint for today's
practice exam,

45
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,233
it's just a practice.

46
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,535
But tomorrow,
not too much water
pre-exam.

47
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,204
-Why not?
-Too many bathroom breaks.

48
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,939
-Right.
-Okay.

49
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,440
Batter up. Ready?

50
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,775
I'm already
a little bit excited.

51
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,443
-Yeah.
-Yeah, look, I'm sweating.

52
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,945
-Really?
-Looks like excite sweat.

53
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,246
-That's fun.
-You wanna feel it?

54
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,247
Yeah.

55
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,815
Ew!  Okay.

56
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,785
All right. Ready?

57
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:41,221
You may begin... now.

58
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,438
-Can I sharpen my pencil?
-Yes.

59
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,943
We should get you
a good mechanical pencil.

60
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,558
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

61
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,594
-Let's celebrate!
-Okay.

62
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,029
--I am.

63
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,397
What do you mean?

64
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,632
-I'm celebrating.
-When?

65
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,935
-Right now.
-Now?

66
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,536
-Right now.
-You're celebrating
right now?

67
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,038
Yep.

68
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,607
Well, we can really celebrate
at prom tomorrow night.

69
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,010
Are you excited?
We can really cut loose.

70
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,978
Yeah, I was thinking of
maybe just doing
some silent reading.

71
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,480
Liam!

72
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,981
When you graduate,
you have to have a prom.

73
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,483
It's a rite of passage.

74
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,484
Who did you invite?

75
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,587
You?

76
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,756
Well, of course I'm
gonna be there, sweetie.

77
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,824
-My best friend.
-You know what?

78
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,893
I love you infinity.

79
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,361
Go outside
and play, kiddo.

80
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,517
Okay.

81
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,585
Okay, now remember,
always put down an answer

82
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,054
even if you don't know
the answer.

83
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,755
And start with
the easiest questions first,

84
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,457
and then move on
to the hardest questions,

85
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:25,958
because that way you'll
leave yourself more time

86
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:26,926
for the things
you don't know

87
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,094
and you won't stress out

88
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,629
about the things
that you do know,

89
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:30,797
because you'll
be freaking out about

90
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,932
some of the harder questions.

91
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:34,600
Liam?

92
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,103
Wow, there are
so many students!

93
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,805
Honey, focus.

94
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,873
-Focus, okay?
-Yeah.

95
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,009
Ugh! I had to
go to this school.

96
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,912
I had to go to this school
for stupid people,
but you don't.

97
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,014
You're going to Cambridge,
because you are special

98
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,449
and you're perfect, all right?

99
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,450
Remember that.

100
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,884
Now we put you in layers,

101
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,619
because if it gets cold,
you can put 'em back on.

102
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,455
When you get hot,
you can take 'em off.

103
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,924
Okay, and don't, like,
look all, like, up in the sky

104
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,459
back and forth
like Stevie Wonder

105
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,793
if you don't
know the answer,

106
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,495
because they will nail
your butt for cheating.

107
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,963
They will. Okay?

108
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,766
Now, when you
pass this test,

109
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,934
you are
a high school graduate.

110
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:13,106
Okay, go! Go get 'em!

111
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,010
What? Oh!

112
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:28,955
Hi, Autumn.

113
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:31,891
Hi, Liam.

114
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,794
Meet Autumn.

115
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,129
She runs a not-for-profit

116
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,730
that protests
cruelty to snails.

117
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,675
All this training
for you, my dear.

118
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,612
And you can begin...

119
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,984
- now.

120
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:04,490
Only losers
get 97 fricking percent.

121
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,725
I've been here all morning.

122
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,193
Autumn insisted
that we come early.

123
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,661
Gross.

124
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,196
You know, Autumn's
been requesting

125
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,964
we do a unit
on Bolivian weaving.

126
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,434
-Hmm.
-She can't get
enough of it. Get this.

127
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,737
She made a traditional
Bolivian flat-knot for me.

128
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,605
I've been using it
as a phone case.

129
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,674
Liam is obsessed
with black holes.

130
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,743
-I love it when you do that.
-Thank you.

131
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,445
Do you want me
to talk dirty?

132
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,113
- Yes.

133
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,815
Looks like we're gonna need
a new trophy case, huh?

134
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,183
These aren't trophies.

135
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,884
They're just awards
for participation.

136
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,123
We have a very high
rate of participation.

137
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,626
It's Dumbo.
Participation's mandatory,
not award-worthy.

138
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:44,163
Well, at this school,
it's award-worthy, you know.

139
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:45,465
I'm the principal.

140
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,933
-Okay.
-That's nice.

141
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:48,534
Normally that
impresses people.

142
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,069
My name's on this one.

143
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,104
It's a participation award
for the debate club.

144
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,474
Oh, yeah. There you go.
Yeah. Hey, congrats.

145
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,576
Thanks. I got pregnant
on that field trip.

146
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:59,045
That's quite a bit
of participation.

147
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,913
I have a son.
I home-school him.

148
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,482
Home-school kids.

149
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,116
-Normally that impresses people.
-Yeah.

150
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,854
Well, hey,
next time you're here,

151
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,956
we'll setup an appointment
and we'll talk curriculum.
Yeah?

152
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,724
Okay, great. We'll probably
never be here again, though.

153
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,259
-Okay.
-Ugh!

154
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,828
That was the closest
I've been to sex in a while.

155
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,530
Me, too.

156
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,664
You know, the kids here
are getting way more than me,

157
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,266
like circle-jerk
parties at 13!

158
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:24,804
Yeah. That's why I'm going
with Liam to Cambridge,

159
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,039
to protect him
from getting derailed.

160
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,875
Autumn's not getting
derailed without me.

161
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,711
No one's having sex
with those kids but us.

162
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,045
Around.

163
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,647
-Yes.
-Or nearby at least.

164
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,583
--Yes!

165
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,885
Fifty-three minutes left.

166
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,654
Good Job, Liam.
Pat on the back.

167
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:52,598
What? All done?

168
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,066
It's impossible.

169
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,902
Apparently it is not.

170
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,703
Uh, you should know
that someone wrote
on the desk

171
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,772
with permanent marker,
"You're a dirty cocksucker."

172
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,841
I'm not
a dirty cocksucker.

173
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,209
It wasn't me.

174
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,095
The light from
the Quanta 6 supernova

175
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,298
is probably hitting
Earth right now.

176

-Yeah, what's your name?
-It's Liam Heap.

184
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,330
It's right there.
It's the only one there.

185
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,098
Right.

186
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,133
You're the kid that called me
"the dirty cocksucker."

187
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,336
That wasn't me.
Somebody wrote it on the desk.

188
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,870
You kids start
these nasty rumors

189
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,306
about me and Tony,
the Phys. Ed. teacher,

190
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,009
because you see me
and Tony hanging at lunch,
shooting hoops?

191
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,243
Well, all right, yeah.

192
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:15,381
I had been with a man,
and it was Tony.

193
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,117
But I'm... I'm not
a dirty cocksucker.

194
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,286
Can I just have
my test back, please?

195
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,055
Okay.

196
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,107
You double-aced it, right?
I mean, you did, right?

197
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,875
You did. I can tell.

198
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,978
Ooh! It's written all over
your superb little face.

199
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,648
I almost think
we should get ice cream.

200
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,182
Almost.

201
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,884
You know what else
I was thinking?

202
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,288
I was thinking today...

203
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,992
um, I'm gonna go
to Cambridge with you.

204
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,662
I mean, why not?

205
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,264
You're gonna be there
all by yourself. Right?

206
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,266
Right?

207
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:11,070
Oh, well, it's locked
and zippered.

208
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,705
Well, let's just...

209
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,774
Oh, wait.
Hold on one second.

210
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,409
I have the key!

211
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,977
So I will...

212
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,446
Oh, wow! It is not
budging the vault.

213
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,681
I see.

214
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,782
It's the wrong key, Mom.

215
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:30,022
Cambridge. Oh, God!
University life.

216
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,991
Hey, you got any
hotties coming in?

217
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,859
No, I don't have
any girlfriends here.

218
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,229
Hey, what's that?

219
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,998
My friend book.

220
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:42,201
It's like online,
but not online.

221
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,071
As you can see,
the top two spaces
are solidly filled,

222
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,707
but the third
is up for grabs.

223
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,809
If you're interested,
I can put you down.

224
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,344
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
put me down there.

225
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,113
That list should fill up
and go viral.

226
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:57,016
Okay. I would really
like to cut in.

227
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,017
All right, he's all yours.

228
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:58,884
-Okay.
-Thanks.

229
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,087
Come here, you.

230
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,956
-This is nice.
-Yeah.

231
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,492
I feel like
a pretty cool kid.

232
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,928
You are such a cool kid.

233
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,796
I hope this is a long song,
'cause Grandma

234
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,199
is chomping at the bit
to dance with you.

235
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,301

a real man today, Liam.

00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,445

No. You failed!

00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,347
You failed home-school!
You failed us!

256
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,550
Look, I can take the test
again in four months.

257
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,320
There must be
some kind of error.
6% in physics?

258
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,823
Physics, Liam.
You own physics!

259
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,191
Technically,
I don't own physics.

260
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,325
Technically,
physics owns me.

261
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,360
How can you get 6%?

262
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,863
-I caved.
-Caved how?

263
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,398
Under intense
high school pressures.

264
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,599
Bull crap!

265
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,334
You know this stuff.

266
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,369
This is why you've been such
a hush-hush bug. What...

267
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,904
What is it?

268
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,540
-Those questions were hard.
-Bull crap!

269
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,409
And plus, females.

270
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,544
I got all frightened,
and tingly, and--

271
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,545
Whoa.

272
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:10,850
Hold the telephone.

273
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,920
You're rebelling.

274
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,623
That's what this is.

275
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,392
Oh, my God! I can't...
I can't even look at your face.

276
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,061
You're rebelling so much.
I can't.

277
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,162
-Mom.
-No.

278
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,263
-Mom, look at me.
-No.

279
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,332
-Mom, look at my face.
-No! No!

280
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:31,370
Look. Mom! I saw some things
that I have never seen before.

281
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,639
I think I need
to fess up here.

282
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,407
Yeah.

283
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,344
I was thinking that maybe
I might make the decision

284
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:42,081
that it's kinda time for me
to maybe go to public school.

285
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:48,053
Public school?
Are you trying to kill me?

286
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,422
Liam, I have taught you
more in days

287
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,157
than they could
teach you in years!

288
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,626
Public school?

289
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,594
-Mom, I don't know what to say.
-Baloney!

290
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,229
What 12-year-old boy

291
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,266
teaches blind kids to read
Braille in Cambodia?

00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,368
You are a man

293
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,104
Baby, I don't get it.

294
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,106

Give me ten reasons!

Now I just wanna
be clear right off the bat.

302
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:59,425
This is school, right?

303
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,093
We're not just sitting
around the house

304
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:04,229
learning about pirates
and making volcanoes.

305
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:07,266
This school is serious.

306
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:12,304
As in serious gangs
and serious drugs. Yeah.

307
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,706
Sometimes I don't even
wanna walk down the halls.

308
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,508
Some of these guys
are packing heat.

309
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:19,445
I mean, take for example,
Maria Sanchez. She's...

310
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,114
Yeah, just like you,

311
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,983
straight A's, sweet kid.

312
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,219
But unfortunately,
she just took a leave.

313
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:28,554
-Because of the drugs?
-No.

314
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,490
She's got a lung thing.
Or no, it's a...

315
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,292
It's a brain thing.
It's one or the other.

316
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,729
It's... I've got it here.
I got it here somewhere.

317
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,697
What's happening?
What's that?

318
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,433
I don't...
Okay, I don't...

319
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,103
You know,
it's a zoo here, okay?

320
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,405
We've got
over 2,000 students.

321
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,675
Right. Well, we tried.
Let's go.

322
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,044
What if I took
the sick girl's spot?

323
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,679
What are you getting at, kid?

324
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,316
Well, if Maria Sanchez is sick,
then I can take her seat,

325
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,318
her classes,
I can do her homework.

326
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:00,652
I mean,
you have a free space

327
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,622
to experience high school
for one week.

328
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,724
That would save me
a lot of paperwork.

329
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,593
You can't really
do that, though.
Can you?

330
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,762
Yeah. No. I mean,
I can do anything

331
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,464
with a memo. Just...

332
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:16,135
Yeah,
Liam can slide right

333
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:19,471
into Maria's slot

334
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:23,175
and take-- take her place
from the...

335
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,544
Um, let's see.

336
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,213
Yeah, go to her classes,
sit at her desk,
do her assignments.

337
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,449
This is her class.
That's her class schedule.

338
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,652
And you're gonna
need this.
This is her ID.

339
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,588
Modern dance and Phys. Ed.
Is that necessary?

340
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:41,660
Yeah.
Maria Sanchez is one
of our top learners.

341
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,630
This looks like
a community center
schedule,

342
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,535
or some kind of
assisted living
center schedule.

343
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,675
A little independence.

344
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,110
It's good for you.

345
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,312
This is so hard.

346
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,447
I know.

347
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,850
-Do you have your key?
-Yeah.

348
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,653
-Okay. And your cell?
-Oh, yeah. It's...

349
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,788
Okay.
Right, one last hug.

350
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,790
Okay, final hug. Go.

351
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,131
Okay, hug break.

352
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,133
We're stuck together,
you and me.

353
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,402
-Yeah, forever.
-Forever.

354
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,870
-Well, not forever.
-No, forever.

355
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,472
-Okay.
-Okay.

356
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,108
Okay!

357
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:45,858
Hey.

358
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,828
-Who're you?
-Hello.

359
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,830
My name's Liam Heap.
I'm here for a week

360
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,799
to win over
the one-legged girl.

361
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,201
And I'm filling in
for Maria Sanchez.

362
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,336
This is her locker?

363
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:59,805
Yeah, Maria is
my locker buddy,

364
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,740
and you're not
getting the combo.

365
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,542
See, I got
my trophies in there.

366
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,178
Okay, you may
not recognize me,

367
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,746
but I am
the reigning champ

368
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,848
at the Cherry Rock High
Halloween Contest,

369
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,416
four years in a row.

370
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:12,651
Four years.

371
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,220
I got last year,
the year before that,

372
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,222
the year before that,
and the year before that.

373
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,657
You know
what I'm saying?

374
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,893
That means that
I am the bar.

375
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,194
Yeah.

376
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,798
You like Rigoberto Bianco?

377
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,334
Yeah, is he a wizard or...

378
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,604
No, no. He's like a...
He's like a Spanish
Michael Bolton.

379
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,713
Look, I'm here
on a mission.

380
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:45,918
Right, the one-legged
wonder girl.

381
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:49,488
I swear, there's a new guy
in here every term
chasing after her.

382
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,456
You know,
she never told anybody
what happened to her leg.

383
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:52,691
She saves that.

384
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:57,930
Anyway, just to be clear...

385
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,466
we're not gonna be friends.

386
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,768
I got enough friends.

387
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,804
--Right.

388
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,359
- Corey.
- Here.

389
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,727
- Stephanie.
- Present.

390
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:31,330
Justine.

391
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,932
Wow! Same class.

392
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:38,670
Looking at her was like
looking at Arp 273,
the rose of galaxies.

393
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,677
Anastasia.

394
00:20:45,677 --> 00:20:48,247
- Rider.
- Anastasia.

395
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,848
- George.
- Present.

396
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,383
Maria.

397
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,618
Maria Sanchez.

398
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:53,952
Oh, uh, here.

399
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,862
Can I help you, Mr. Teacher?

400
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,631
Maria's five-second
rule experiment.

401
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,366
I expect it
at the end of the term.

402
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,968
No, um, actually,
I'm not Maria Sanchez.

403
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,671
I'm just here for a week.
I'm home-schooled.

404
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:13,872
Aren't we all?

405
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,511
- Sarah.
- Here.

406
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,612
- Harry.

407
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,650
No.

408
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,851
- No.
- Honey?

409
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,519
Not in a classroom.

410
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,820
- It's my mom.
- Liam, are you there?

411
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,058
Hola, mi nombre
es Maria Sanchez.

412
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,361
No,
I'm Maria Sanchez.

413
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,830
She has, like,
a lung or a brain thing.
It's pretty bad.

Hi, penis breath.

431
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,777
Where's Maria?

432
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:02,013
Oh, she's sick with a lung
and a brain thing.

433
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:04,616
It's at... My name is actually
not "penis breath," it's Liam.

434
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,084
I'm BDC.

435
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:09,955
-BDC?
-Brian Denis Chad.

436
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:12,391
That's like three
first names, sort of.

437
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,594
No. That's a first,
middle, and last.

438
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,696
Yeah, in that...
In your case, yeah.

439
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:27,406
Earthquake, Maria!

440
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:29,741
Good.

441
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,437
Hello!

442
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,139
Liam, hello.
Honey, is everything
all right?

443
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,544
Liam? Hello?

444
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:08,747
Hey, Mom. No, it's fine.

445
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,016
It was a wrong number.
Sorry, I didn't mean
to call you.

446
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,218
Oh. Okay,
I love you, sweetie.

447
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,920
I love you, too. Bye.

448
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,707
You're an even bigger
nerd than me.

449
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:40,178
Oh, yeah, I just figured
I'd warm my pants up. Toasty.

450
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:44,783
Oh, I forget to tell you
BDC is an asshole.

451
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,952
Yeah,
I figured that out.

452
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,588
So, what? Everybody
calls me "Maria" now?

453
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:53,525
It's caught on pretty fast.
I mean, your name's Maria now.

454
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:55,126
It's pretty. Work with it.

455
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:09,007
Hey, new kid on the block.

456
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,083
- She has a limp?
- Yeah.

457
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,520
A real irregular gait.
Not weird, just irregular,

458
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,655
like she puts
all of her movement
onto her strongest leg.

459
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:26,625
Kinda like one of those
gimpy dogs that has
all that courage.

460
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,261
Liam, are you sure
that this girl is real?

461
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,897
She kinda reminds me
of a cyborg,
but she's very real.

462
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,533
-Did she say anything
else to you?
-Yeah, I told you.

463
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,636
She looked at me and then
she smiled like this.

464
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,071
And then she said,
"Ooh, hello there, you."

465
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,210
- I think she likes you.
- Whoa!

466
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,145
Okay, uh,

467
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:50,815
wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,
wow, wow, wow, wow, wow!

468
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:54,052
Uh, I don't know.
That's... Mmm, okay.

469
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,987
I knew this would happen.

470
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,690
I mean, if I'd had a girl,
she would stay with me forever,

471
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,692
like, even after
she got married.

472
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:04,029
But a guy like you, meet a girl
and then you're gone.

473
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,164
-What? That's not true.
-Yeah, it is true.

474
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,199
Grandma warned me it was gonna
happen, and she was right.

475
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:11,803
Grandma, that's not true.
Mom, you're my best friend.

476
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:14,806
I love you infinity.

477
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:17,842
- That's a long time.
- Yeah, it's the most.

478
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,353
It wasn't
until the next day

479
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:32,924
that I realized in that one
minute between 1:44 and 1:45,

480
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:36,027
right near the southwest
handicapped bathroom,

481
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,228
we would pass each other.

482
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:38,597
Hi!

483
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:42,067

-Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
-We haven't really
talked about this.

497
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,244
I just feel like you're
moving so fast already.

Are you thinking about
sleeping with her?

499
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,416
Oh, Mom! I mean,
Grandma's right here.

500
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,652
She's eating.
She's not listening.

501
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,421
-Grandma,
you want a fire truck?
-Yes, dear.

502
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:37,989
Okay, so, are you
thinking of sex?

503
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,359
Yes, honey.

504
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,828
-No, Mom,
I'm talking to Liam.
-I mean, no.

505
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,830
No, I mean,
I was sort of thinking
about touching her leg,

506
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,099
touching her leg
at school is sort of
like a legend, so...

507
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:51,169
Liam, I'm not stupid.
No one celebrates virginity.

508
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,203
I mean, we should.

509
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,407
-High five!
-Right?

510
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,909
Yeah! Now, I know I'm a mom,

511
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,378
but I know you boys
think about it,

512
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,981
I change your sheets,
and I know the pressure
you put on yourselves,

513
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,949
but listen, I mean,

514
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:08,319
you guys have gone
so far already that
I think, you know,

515
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,854
I think she might be...

516
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,424
-a bit of a whore.
-Whoa!

517
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,392
- I mean, I hate
that I had to say that.

518
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,229
You know, I think
maybe I should eat lunch
in the cafeteria.

519
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:20,265
So you can have lunch
with the one-legged girl?

520
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:22,367
Well, it just doesn't seem
like a lot of other moms

521
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,102
are here with
their kids at school.

522
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,104
That cafeteria serves
homeless-person food.

523
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,139
I'm adding years
to your life here.

524
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,775
Well, I just feel like
maybe I should eat lunch
with the other students.

525
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,744
If you were having lunch
with a guy,
I'd be fine with that.

526
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,412
You'd be fine if your mom
was dude-dating?

527
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:35,880
Yeah, yeah, I would.

528
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,849
I mean, if he was
a nice gentleman.

529
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,251
-Okay, but--
-I'm not allowed
to have sugar.

530
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:43,021
No, you can have sugar.

531
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:46,791
I don't care. Makes you
grumpy-pants, but...
Whatever.

532
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,327
Okay. Well, I'm gonna stealth
out of the car and you're not
gonna be able to see me

533
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,729
'cause I'm gonna be
so stealthy. Ninja.

I have badminton practice.

But you've done the week.
We said one week.

needs me.

So I'm just gonna
go practice after

575
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:51,216
and then maybe just
a few more months of school.

576
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,418
A few more months?
Are you joking?

of badminton at school.

right now, like right now.

633
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:05,269
You're rebelling
with a capital R,

634
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:09,574
and I think it's a good thing,
a necessary thing for
our success at Cambridge.

635
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:13,244
So let's do it now together

636
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:16,547
and get it out
of your system
before university

637
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,383
in a safe
and responsible way,
okay?

638
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:21,285
Do what together?

-Liam.

662
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,883
Um, not wearing pants.

663
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:30,354
Mm, how about
staying out late?

664
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,589

00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,228
-Ooh.
-Skipping school.

667
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:41,632
Ooh. Uh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Uh, swearing.

668
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:43,901
Bingo, bango. Yes.

669
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:48,539
-Getting my nose pierced.
-No way. No way.

670
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,509
That is permanent.
Why don't we start
with swearing?

671
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,844
Go ahead. Say the big one.

672
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,346

673
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,882
Why would you say that?
Say the big one.

-Fuck.

-Okay, say it again.
-Fuck.

680

and say, "Fuck off, book!"

00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,018
fuck you, black pens,
fuck you, blue pens.

690
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:37,455
-And fuck you--
-No, don't you effing dare.

691
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,757
No, "F" for fail.

692
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:42,426
Sorry.

693
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:44,629
I forgive you.

694
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:51,035
Now that word is also a verb.

695
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,905
Liam, I can see it written

696
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:56,507
all over your face

697
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,542
and there is no easy
way to do this.

698
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,012
When I say "Trojan,"

699
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:02,847
what is your first thought?

700
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:09,553
The ancient city of Troy,
Hector and Achilles,

701
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:12,056
the Greek and Trojan soldiers
famous for their bravery

702
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,593
in battle and their
seven-layered ox-hide shields.

703
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:20,364
And sodomy.

704
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:23,367
So the Trojans are still
very much alive today.

705
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,336
They are living in there.

706
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,706
Think of that as
a one-layer latex shield.

707
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,475
Who would go into battle
without one of those
on their penis, right?

708
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,611
-Right, that's a good point.
-Okay, so...

709
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:39,050
I want you to practice
in here alone in the dark.

710
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:42,620
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need me.

711
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:50,861
Oh, hello, Anastasia.

712
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,863
You see, I have
this condom here.

713
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,800
I was wondering if you'd like
to have intercourse with me.

714
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,568
Oh, you would?

715
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:58,569
--Great.

716
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,718
-Mom?
-Yeah.

717
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,019
Eight seconds.

718
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:20,825
I don't know what happened,
but eventually her...

719
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:21,692
Hello!

720
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,695
...turned into...
- Hey.

721
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,465
...which then became...

722
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:30,568
Until finally...

723
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:40,111
We were a 110%
off each other.

724
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,046
Wow. Crazy.

725
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:47,017
Oh, frig! Oh, frig!

726
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,932
You look like
you need a hug.

727
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:07,471
No, no, no, I'm not allowed
to touch the students.

728
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:08,906
But you definitely look
like you need a hug.

729
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:16,514
Come with me.
Let's talk about your future.

730
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:19,984
So what did you say
this was called again?

731
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,085
Astronomy.

732
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,788
Astronomy. Astronomy.

733
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:29,560
I don't see astronomy in here,
but I do see massage therapy.

734
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,095
Yeah, I was thinking
more astronomy.

735
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,830
Yeah, but you could
get your certificate

736
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,632
in eight months
and you're done.

737
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,000
Okay.

738
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,868
Besides, you look like
a massage therapist.

739
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:40,438
Do you know how good that is?
You get to touch people.

740
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,840
I can't touch anybody here.
I'm just saying,

741
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,841
you gotta keep your
options open, you know?

742
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,476
You know, a few years ago,

743
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:47,578
there was a kid who did
a string of B-and-E's.

744
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,713
He got sent to the state pen
for three years.

745
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,850
But he fast-tracked
a sociology degree for free.

746
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,151
I'm not saying
that's the route
you need to go,

747
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,820
but something
to think about.

748
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,087
You know, my whole life,

749
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:58,789
all I've wanted
to do is astronomy.

750
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,224
All right.
Why don't we do this?

751
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:02,827
Why don't we take
our personality/job test

752
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:05,062
on the computer,
and see what that says?

753
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,631
Okay.

754
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,534
Hey, that... The guy

755
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,102
who did the B-and-E's

756
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:16,106
and then went to jail,
uh, what did he become?

757
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:23,781
At a party, do you interact

758
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:26,750
with everyone, few, yourself?

759
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:31,989
Everyone.

760
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,059
Yourself, C.

761
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,261
Do you walk with big steps,

762
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:38,696
varied steps, little steps?

763
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,536
Big steps!

764
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,572
Little steps.

765
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:51,809
When meeting new people,
do you introduce yourself,

766
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,777
wait to be introduced,
be silent?

767
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,851
You introduce yourself.

768
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,186
Be silent.

769
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:13,264
Ugh,
why can't I be the guy
who picks A?

770
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:16,600
Oh,
look at that 'stache!

771
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,003
Okay, Liam, it is...
It is the easiest thing
in the world

772
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,004
to entertain a woman.

773
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,539
Honestly, you just

774
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,207
ask her questions about herself.

775
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,809
Get her talking.
Pretend I'm Anastasia, okay?

776
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,077
You're not Anastasia.

777
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:29,980
You are Liam, I'm Anastasia!

778
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,883
-Comment on my looks.
-You look like my mom.

779
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,653
Well, I'll take that
as a compliment.

780
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:38,889
Do you wanna talk
about my... my smile?

781
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,724
You have a nice smile.
It makes me smile.

782
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,127
Do you wanna say something
about how I smell?

783
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:46,597
You smell like my mom.

784
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,732
Well, your mom smells good.

785
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,701
Look, Anastasia,
don't you think

786
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,570
it's a little a bit weird
that my mom

787
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,637
is on a date with us?

788
00:42:55,606 --> 00:42:59,276
No, I think that you
have a very cool mother.

789
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:01,245
Yeah, who has a loser
for a son.

790
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,823
Liam! What are you doing?

791
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:14,625
Something I should have
done a long time ago.

792
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:41,318
-Maria.
-Oh, great.

793
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:43,387
I got your personality
and job match back.

794
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:45,923
Good news!

795
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:48,826
You know, some stories
have a sad ending.

796
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:52,763
This one, I believe,
is a very happy ending.

797
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,798
Massage therapist,
just like I thought.

798
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,638
What's wrong?
Come on in. Sit down.

799
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:04,742
-It's your father, isn't it?
-No.

800
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,011
-What did your father do?
-Nothing.

801
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,246
It's okay.
Those are tough questions.

802
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,348
It's a girl thing.
It's a girl problem.

803
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:13,150
I have a problem with a girl.

804
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,351
Oh, it's a girl problem.

805
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,124
See this cup?
This cup is you.

806
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:24,795
-Okay.
-Sweet, precious, gentle.

807
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:26,096
It's got a heart.

808
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,036
Do not share your cup
with someone

809
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:33,837
unless you're ready
to have it smashed.

810
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,241
Now put it back together.

811
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:44,915
I can't put it
back together.

812
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:52,089
Hey, kid!
You want some candy?

813
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,124
-Mom? Hey!
-Come on.

814
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,694
I got some good shit in here.

815
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,762
-What are you talking about?
-Come on, kid, get in the car.

816
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,097
You're being weird.

817
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,432
What are you? A pussy?

818
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:02,366
Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy,

819
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,034
pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy!

820
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,836
- All right.

821
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:10,741
I can't believe you got
in the car so quickly!

822
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:13,310
-What if I was a pervert?
-What? You're my mom.

823
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,412
-What is that?
-Weed.

824
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:17,347
Okay, now you're bound

825
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:18,982
to get pressured into it
at some point,

826
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:20,751
so let's just try it now

827
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:21,985
in a safe environment.

828
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:23,353
Well, where did you--
where did you--

829
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,955
Where did you get this?

830
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,193
Where-- Is this a...

831
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:32,029
This is a test.

832
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:34,431
-No. Say "no" to drugs.
-No, no.

833
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:35,999
No, honey, it's not a test.

834
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:38,836
This is a-- This is
a supervised first try.

835
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:41,772
It's called a "hotbox."

836
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,974
You get, like, a little bit
of a better high,

837
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:45,776
because it's like
you're in a box.

838
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:47,111
You serious? Yeah, I know.

839
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:48,846
No, I know the physics of it.

840
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,247
I just don't know the ethics.

841
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:52,349
Are you...

842
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:56,320
You shouldn't sm--

843
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:00,357
Ooh!

844
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,093
It's burny.

845
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,530
It's Bernie Sanders.

846
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,832
Are we gonna get--
Um, are we gonna get

847
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:10,501
caught or busted or...

848
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,336
No, you're with me and Grandma.

849
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:14,004
Here, take a hit.

850
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:16,807
Is it indica or sativa
or ruderalis?

851
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:18,509
I don't know.

852
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,244
Well, they have
different THC levels.

853
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,045
Well, go ahead and hurry up
and hit it.

854
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:23,347
I don't wanna get caught.

855
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,288
What do you mean,
get caught?

856
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,523
I thought this was...

857
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:33,791
I thought it was prescription.

858
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,159
-Grandma?
-Mm-hmm.

859
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:37,995
-Well, it's legal for her.
-But not for us?

860
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:40,464
Technically... Technically, no.

861
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,003
-- Oh, my God!
He scared me.

862
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:47,571
Hide that. Hide the joint!
Hide the joint!

863
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,944
-Hey, hi.
-Hello.

864
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:56,079
-Hello.
-Principal Kelly!

865
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,283
Wow! It definitely smells
like marijuana in here.

866
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:02,953
Yeah, Grandma's arthritis
is a real knock-out.

867
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,888
-Oh! Hi, Grandma!
-It's Grandma.

868
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:06,890
Yeah. Look, I'm no
disciplinarian, okay?

869
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,158
-Thank God!
-I just play one for work.

870
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,227
-So, I'm fun a guy.
-Yeah.

871
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:13,931
Um, listen, I wanna just...
We got disconnected before

872
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:16,867
and I would just love

873
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:20,904
to cook you kebabs
at my place.

874
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:23,040
It's a great view,
if you're into that.

875
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,943
Um, maybe some wine,
if you like.

876
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:28,412
Maybe a mutually-
agreed-upon kiss,

877
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,314
- if you are into that.

878
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:34,484
Okay. No. Um, look,
I-- I should be clear.

879
00:47:34,484 --> 00:47:38,088
I have very strict rules
about not hooking up

880
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:39,957
with teachers
at my school. Right.

881
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:43,160
-But anyone outside
of school of age is...
-Mm-hmm.

882
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,195
...fair game, and you're
your own school,

883
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,630
so you're fair game.

884
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:51,168
I sort of have a rule
about dating my son's...

885
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:54,137
My son's...
My son's principals.

886
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:57,074
-So...
-Yeah.

887
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:00,344
You guys drive safe. Okay.

888
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:01,245
Bye!

889
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:06,216
-Holy buckets.
-Holy buckets is right.

890
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,085
That was totally cookadoo.

891
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:11,221
But I think he didn't know
we were high.

892
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:18,495
- Oh, my God!
- What?

893
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:20,397
That's her.
That's Anastasia.

894
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:22,366
- The girl with the limp?
-  - Yeah.

895
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:25,002
-What the heck?
-She's our neighbor?

896
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:27,437
How have I never
seen her here before?

897
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:30,207
You are so much more
handsome than that guy.

898
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,441
She's gonna flip out
when she finds out

899
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:32,943
you're on
the badminton team.

900
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:35,612
-No.
-Do you wanna smoke any more?

901
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:37,147
-No.
-No, thank you.

902
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:38,682
I'm pretty high now.

903
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,684
Oh, crap. It says,

904
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:43,687

Oh, I'm such a loser.

922
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,403
Maria, you got no shot.

923
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:35,372
Okay. Girls, they just...

924
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:37,074
They just date dicks.

925
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:38,375
Love guys who
treat 'em like dicks,

926
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,344
and girls just love dicks.

927
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,412
Then I'm gonna be
Anastasia's dick.

928
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:46,450
Well, then you gotta make
a bold dick move, man.

929
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,518
-You know, show her
you can compete.
-Yeah.

930
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:50,587
-Girls love that shit.
-Yeah.

931
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,057
Yeah. Wait...

932
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:00,430
Uh, you mean like kiss her?

933
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:02,666
-Well, did she try to kiss you?
-No.

934
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,135
-Mmm. Did you see her bobos?
-No.

935
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,471
-Have you ever seen bobos, Liam?
-Yes.

936
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:09,473
- You're full of shit.
- No, I have!

937
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:16,246
- Hey.
- Hey.

938
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:17,481
-I'm gonna go to bed.
-Okay.

939
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,082
-Good night.
-Good night.

940
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:21,151
That's absolutely
disgusting,

941
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:22,352
but hot at the same time.

942
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,255
You know, your mom
is really hot.

943
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:26,556
Like she could be your sister.

944
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:28,492
God, I'd play

945
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:29,693
all 18 holes of that.

946
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,661
Yeah. Yeah.

947
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:34,598
Hey, what's their problem?

948
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,407
-Holy fuck!
-What? What?

949
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:47,577
Uh, Maria Sanchez is dead.

950
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,659
The day Maria died...

951
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,130
was the best day
of my life.

952
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:15,806
Suddenly everyone treated me
like I had died,

953
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:19,242
but I never felt more alive.

954
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,448
Hey.

955
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,453
I'm a total dick.

956
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:32,689
Do you know I never said
a single word to Maria,

957
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,558
but now I kinda feel like
because of you

958
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,126
I get the chance to change that.

959
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:38,562
God! I love you, Maria Sanchez.

960
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:43,700
I'm s-- sorry, Maria.

961
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:50,173
Most people didn't give
a shit about Maria.

962
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:52,509
I mean, Aisley sure as hell
wasn't her friend.

963
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:55,612
I guess it's like nobody
really cares until--

964
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:56,813
You lose a leg.

965
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,483
Yeah.

966
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:07,491
Um, I'm gonna be
right back, okay?

967
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:08,859
- Okay.
- Yeah.

968
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:15,599
Oh, God, ew!

969
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,202
Bold dick move.
You gotta do it.

970
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:36,453
You didn't cut him up?

971
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,355
Uh, no, I didn't have the heart.

972
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,634
Hey, you live in
Greenwood Street, right?

973
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:51,768
Yeah.

974
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:54,604
--One sec. Sorry.

975
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:00,944
--Fire alarm.

976
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:02,746
My mom and I
practiced this at home.
Follow me.

977
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:07,417

-Mmm.
-What? Is it skunked?

994
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,446
I think it's gone bad.

995
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:14,284
I don't think it's bad.

996
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,721
Mmm.

997
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:21,992
Gross, but the least worst.

998
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,326
Oh, God, honey,
I love you,

999
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:24,995
but that is
a pussy drink.

1000
00:54:24,995 --> 00:54:28,298
- Oh, that's perfect!
- No. No.

1001
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:31,534
Like bad pussy,
like you are the pussy.

1002
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:35,272
So wait, I get...
We wanna get the pussy,
not drink the pussy.

1003
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,740
I mean, yes,

1004
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,309
but what I meant
by pussy in this
situation is,

1005
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:41,311
is that it's wimpy. Wimpy.

1006
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:45,582
So drinking a wimpy
drink makes you wimpy
and then wimpy...

1007
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:50,553
Wimpy guys don't
get the literal pussy.

1008
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:52,589
If we're gonna
talk anatomy,

1009
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:54,724
-can we talk about balls?
-Sure.

1010
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:56,993
-Balls of steel?
-Mmm-hmm.

1011
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,928
I mean,
who came up with that?

1012
00:54:58,928 --> 00:55:02,465
My balls are like
tiny little grapes,
sensitive, weird.

1013
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:05,435
It's like a metaphor or--

1014
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:07,570
Are there men with
actual balls of steel?

1015
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:49,813
Not afraid.

1016
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:03,093
All right. Have your key
and everything?

1017
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:05,862
Yep, got it all.
All ready to go.
Here we go.

1018
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,531
Okay. Here we go.

1019
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,066
-Ooh!
-Oh, man!
What was that?

1020
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:12,836
-That's probably
a flat tire.
-What?

1021
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:15,372
Yeah. I'll probably
just have to carpool
with Anastasia today.

1022
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,974
I was... Wait, well, wait.
I'll just... Honey,
I'll just change the tire!

1023
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:20,543
Are you sure
it's safe to ride with
a peg-legged driver, Li--

1024
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,644
Yeah. No, it's gonna be fine.

1025
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:27,884
Whoa!

1026
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,120
Huh, almost lost my legs.

1027
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,389
I didn't see you
there, Maria.

1028
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,990
I got a flat tire.

1029
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:36,059
I've got five bucks
for some gas money.
Carpool?

1030
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,628
-Yeah, okay.
-Cool.

1031
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,498
--I love you.

1032
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,136
I should let you know
that in a few months,

1033
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:47,604
I'll be leaving
for England.

1034
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:50,607
I'm gonna study
astronomy at Cambridge.

1035
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:54,043
So you should probably
know our time is short.

1036
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:57,881
-Stephen Hawking.
-Okay, thanks.

1037
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:00,483
Yeah. I'm a horoscope
junkie, too.

1038
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:02,952
I read it and then
I will it true.

1039
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:06,856
Don't tell me,
you are a...

1040
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:12,929
I wanna say Libra,
but something
in your eyes tells me...

1041
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:16,766
-Virgo.
-Pisces.

1042
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,169
Mmm. That's too bad,
I'm a Leo.

1043
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:21,905
-Not compatible.
-Nuts.

1044
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:24,040
Those 14 minutes
in Anastasia's truck

1045
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,476
to and fro school
was my life.

1046
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,445
Everything else faded away.

1047
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:31,214
Hey, you know, every song,
every good song,

1048
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:33,983
all you pretty much need
are the words

1049
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:39,456
"woman," "love,"
"heartbreak," "beautiful."

1050
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,926
You know what?
You're totally right.

1051
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:44,494
And the word "sex"
a few times.

1052
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:48,932
♪ Love a woman ♪

1053
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,936
♪ And let this
beautiful woman ♪

1054
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:56,005
Some guys had
dinner dates, movie dates.

1055
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:57,040
I had the carpool date.

1056
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,041
That's cool. My treat.

1057
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:00,076
Thanks.

1058
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:02,979
Did I just see a picture
of a girl in there?

1059
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,113
Oh, no, that's nobody.

1060
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:08,551
Liam?
Is that your girlfriend?

1061
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,922
Yeah. Yeah, it is. It is.
It's my girlfriend.

1062
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,924
Oh!
Score, Liam.

1063
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,092
-Yeah.
-Is she hot?

1064
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:17,527
-Oh, man!
-Let me see.

1065
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:18,595
-No, she's just--
-Let me see.

1066
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:19,662
Let me see.
Let me see.

1067
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:26,002
-Isn't that your mom?
-Yes, it is.

1068
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:29,105
So, Mr. Astronomy,
tell me my future.

1069
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:32,609
You're a Leo.
I see a lot of sunshine
in your future.

1070
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:35,612
And?

1071
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,647
I mean, you want me to
tell you that everything's
gonna be fine

1072
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:38,982
and that
anything's possible.

1073
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:41,017
But that's not
really true, is it?

1074
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,686
I mean, women have less
opportunities than men.
They get paid less.

1075
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,588
White men have way
more opportunities.

1076
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:49,726
Mom!
Mom, grab my hand!

1077
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:52,896
Mom? What are you doing
outside the window?

1078
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:56,132
Mom, you're slipping!
I can feel you slipping!

1079
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:57,767
Mom! Oh!

1080
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:01,971
Like, I mean, you've lost
something that everybody
else has, your leg.

1081
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:06,609
-Yeah, I know.
-So you know no fear.

1082
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:09,245
You know anything
is possible

1083
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:11,814
and I think for you,
anything is possible.

1084
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:12,916
I think you're gonna
be an astronaut.

1085
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,286
An astronaut?

1086
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:19,656
Wow! That's a lot
more than my daily
horoscope said,

1087
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:21,624
all it said was
I was gonna get lucky.

1088
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:48,117
Do you wanna touch it?

1089
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:53,156
-Oh, my God, yes.
-Okay, then touch it.

1090
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:59,729
The cancer
started out here and
it was extremely rare,

1091
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:02,332
like three-people rare.

1092
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:03,967
And then all of a sudden,
it was here.

1093
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:07,770
I hate cancer.

1094
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:11,074
And they finally decided
to cut it off here.

1095
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:16,779
-That sucks.
-And it's all gone,
for now.

1096
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,149
And I think that
sometimes--

1097
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:25,221
Yeah, I think sometimes
things happen for a reason

1098
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:28,791
and sometimes I think
things happen
that just suck.

1099
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,396
And the voice
in my head is like,

1100
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:35,031
"Well, what are
you gonna do now?"

1101
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:39,135
I don't know why
my inner voice
is so manly.

1102
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,804
But I can still do
everything, you know?

1103
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,940
You know, run, swim,

1104
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:46,342
sex.

1105
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:53,182
Earthquake, Maria!

1106
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,820
BDC needs a ride today.

1107
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,389
- Hey, hottie.
- Hi, cutie.

1108
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:01,190
How much?

1109
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,159
I'll do anything for a ten,
more for a 20 though.

1110
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:06,029
-Uh?
-Let's go.

1111
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:07,263
-Hop in, Maria.
-Okay.

1112
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:10,299
Freezing my tits off.

1113
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:27,083
--BDC, stop calling him!

1114
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,757
Paging Maria Sanchez
to the office, please.

1115
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:43,132
-May I help you?
-Yeah, I'm Maria Sanchez.

1116
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,936
No. I'm Maria Sanchez.

1117
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:49,472
And just like that,
Maria was back
from the dead.

1118
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:55,278
-Hablas español?
-I mean,
I can count to ten.

1119
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:58,347
-Uno, dos, tres,
cuatro, cinco--
-Yeah, I get it.

1120
01:01:58,347 --> 01:01:59,282
I can read Braille.

1121
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:01,718
But you can see.

1122
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:04,387
Yeah, I can see.

1123
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:07,824
Huh.

1124
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:10,460
Sorry about the confusion.

1125
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,329
I guess it must have been
a bad rumor, you know?

1126
01:02:15,198 --> 01:02:17,433
It turns out she was
never even sick.

1127
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:21,504
She was on an exchange
with another student
from Brazil.

1128
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:25,875
I mean, it was all filed,
but this place is just...
Ugh!

1129
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:31,948
It's probably
on the old comp.
I'll just...

1130
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:37,253
--Mmm, nope.

1131
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,921
Yeah, so what does
that mean for me?

1132
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:42,158
Not good for you,
but for me, good.

1133
01:02:42,158 --> 01:02:44,460
You know,
now that you're no longer
an official student here,

1134
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,964
I can go on the record
that I am actively
pursuing your mother.

1135
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:51,868
And I think my chances
are pretty, pretty good.

1136
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,438
Yeah.

1137
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:57,840
Yeah.

1138
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:01,878
Okay, that's...

1139
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:10,453
The five-second
rule is a myth.

1140
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:13,322
Five, ten, 100,
it doesn't matter,
it's all the same germs.

1141
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:16,859
Some pretty well-executed
data entry.

1142
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:18,561
Yeah, I know. We got an A.

1143
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:21,397
Yeah, you got A's
in all my classes
except dance.

1144
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:24,233
Really? Someone
said I was lit.

1145
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:26,302
I'm pretty good
at square dancing.
So I'm a bit cheesed.

1146
01:03:28,571 --> 01:03:30,473
Sorry I'm still alive.

1147
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,842
Me, too.
But I understand.

1148
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,512
- Thanks.

1149
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:49,258
"Anastasia's car, dirty."

1150
01:03:58,601 --> 01:04:01,504
Honey, I know you're upset,
but I did tell you
that public school

1151
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,240
is just an institution
for low expectations.

1152
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,443
So I want you to
forget about school,
forget about the girl.

1153
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:10,213
It's time to party.
So get dressed.

1154
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:12,515
We're gonna call tonight
your rebound night.

1155
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,317
Here.

1156
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:15,318
Everyone's wearing them.

1157
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:24,360
-Cool.
-What did you just say?

1158
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,429
Cool.

1159
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:29,532
I feel like
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

1160
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:33,236
This is so stupid.
I don't know where
to find a party.

1161
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:36,572
Well, come on, let's go
closer to the college.
There'll be some there.

1162
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:38,074
I'll keep looking.

1163
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:40,543
I'm sorry.
I'm nervous.

1164
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,111
Kind of excited to
let loose a little.

1165
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:45,281
Whoo!

1166
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:46,282
Ah, that was fun.

1167
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:49,218
Come on, Autumn. Try it.

1168
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:51,554
Whoo!

1169
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:57,460
Here, sweetie.
Pussy drink. Take three.

1170
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,395
Three for you is a rager,

1171
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:01,163
'cause you're
a lightweight.
Be safe. All right?

1172
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:03,065
Mmm.

1173
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:06,602
Oh, it hurts. Mmm.
And it tastes like
peaches, sparkly.

1174
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:10,473
So the rule is we will
stay one room away from
you guys at all times

1175
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:13,142
and if anyone asks
who invited you,
just say Mike,

1176
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:14,510
because everyone has
a friend named Mike.

1177
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:16,445
-I don't.
-Aw.

1178
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:19,115
You do tonight, tiger.
All right. Let's split up.

1179
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:21,550
Go party.

1180
01:05:24,387 --> 01:05:28,524
Hey, um, will you keep
an eye on Liam for me,
please?

1181
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:31,160
-Of course.
And same with Autumn?
-Yeah, yeah.

1182
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,029
-Okay.
-Definitely.

1183
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:35,431
Hey, why are you
drinking so much?

1184
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:39,101
Uh, I just...
I get really nervous
at these social events

1185
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:42,238
and I don't wanna
end up in a corner
by myself like usual.

1186
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:44,206
Those days are gonzo.

1187
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:47,310
Totally. Okay. Come on.

1188
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:45,701
We have peppers,
we have cheese!
It's nacho time!

1189
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:55,111
How did I not think I would--

1190
01:06:57,446 --> 01:07:00,783
I am in desperate
need of a beverage

1191
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:02,618
and since you,
Mr. Liam,

1192
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:05,154
are on dry land,
you need to get me one.

1193
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:08,257
Oh, here. Do you
want some of this?
It's like warm soup.

1194
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:11,093
Yes. Thank you, Claire!

1195
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:15,031
Are you scared of
the water, land lover?

1196
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:17,166
Oh, I didn't bring
my trunks or anything.

1197
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:20,069
Oh. Well, neither did we.

1198
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:38,220
-You're taking a long time
to get in the water.
-I'm coming as fast as I can.

1199
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:41,190
Whoa!

1200
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,460
-Whoo!
-Ooh!

1201
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,429
Now it's a party!

1202
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:48,798
Um, did you see Autumn inside?

1203
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:52,068
Yeah, uh, she was
cleaning the sliding doors.

1204
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,669
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

1205
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:55,304
- Liam!
- Mom!

1206
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:57,840
Honey! Where's your shirt?

1207
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,475
-Oh...
-You're gonna catch a cold.

1208
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:01,143
I'm gonna make you
some hot tea, okay?

1209
01:08:01,143 --> 01:08:03,479
No, Mom. I'm okay, really.

1210
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:06,482
How can you be having fun
if you're cold
and soaking wet?

1211
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:09,218
Mom, I was thinking about
maybe staying
for the party.

1212
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:10,820
Okay, we can stay for a bit.

1213
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:13,089
No, I was thinking that
maybe you should go.

1214
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,791
I get it.

1215
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:18,427
You wanna make out
with a girl, honey,
you go for it.

1216
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:20,729
So many pretty ones here.
Okay, honey, bye!

1217
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:23,599
-Bye. I love you.
-I love you.

1218
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:27,670
Autumn, what happened
to your face?

1219
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:31,440
There is red food coloring
in lip balm. I ate it all.

1220
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:41,517
Hold on, okay?

1221
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:47,423
911,
what's your emergency?

1222
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:49,191
Hi, I have a noise complaint.

1223
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:11,180
Hey, Maria.
Thanks for the invite.

1224
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:20,589
What happened?

1225
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:22,825
-You got punched
in the face.
-Oh...

1226
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,427
- I'm such a bad person.

1227
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:30,566
I'm a terrible mom.
Autumn is so crazy.
She has no friends.

1228
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:33,836
Look, I finished
my knitting cap.

1229
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:35,771
- Oh.

1230
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:40,843
Oh, what am I doing?
Come on. Let's go.

1231
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,451
Oh. That's my mom.

1232
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:51,353
- Oh, god.

1233
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:52,888
Mom?

1234
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:55,558
Liam! Liam Heap!

1235
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:57,660
Liam!

1236
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:02,831
You get in the frigging car
right now! In the car!

1237
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,869
Okay. Sorry. Sorry, Mom.

1238
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:08,204
Get in the car!

1239
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:11,974
You get in the car!

1240
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:14,243
Autumn,
get in the back seat!

1241
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:15,477
You get in the back seat!

1242
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:16,645
In the front seat,
Mackenzie!

1243
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:18,280
Autumn, get in
the backseat!

1244
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:20,816
Get in the car!

1245
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:32,261
Slut.

1246
01:10:32,261 --> 01:10:35,664
I'm so sorry that I decided
that I wanted to take you
to your first college party

1247
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:37,499
and teach you how to get
drunk for the first time.

1248
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:38,867
Everything's
a frigging lesson
with you!

1249
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:41,003
"Oh, Liam, this is how
you write a test, Liam."

1250
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:42,771
I don't. You make me
sound like a moron!

1251
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:44,607
"Yeah, Liam,
this is how you party.

1252
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:46,542
"Liam, this is how you drink,
this is how you have fun!"

1253
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:48,277
You made out with Mackenzie!

1254
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:50,346
So what?

1255
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:51,780
She was really nice.
What? Would you rather
I made out with you?

1256
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,415
-Ugh.
-Hmm? Mom, what?

1257
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,517
-Whoa!
-Come on. Show me
the ropes, Mom.

1258
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:57,319
You know what?
I'm sorry I just tried
to make the best for you.

1259
01:10:57,319 --> 01:11:00,022
You're not! You want me
to be better, but I can't.

1260
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:02,424
I'm a loser. I don't even
wanna go to Cambridge.

1261
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:04,660
Oh, you poor,
privileged white male!

1262
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:07,496
No, I wanna go become
a massage therapist!

1263
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:08,564
Don't you dare!

1264
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:14,003
Liam? Liam!

1265
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:23,279
What the hell?
Oh, my god!
What are you doing?

1266
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,347
-Another lesson, obviously!
-This is my door!

1267
01:11:25,347 --> 01:11:27,716
You're out of control!

1268
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:30,519
-Get that stupid shirt--
-Get out! Get out of here!

1269
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:36,692
Sometimes moms...
Ow! You little shit!
Liam! Ow!

1270
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:41,063
You are very, very...
Get over here.

1271
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:43,065
Ah!

1272
01:11:45,801 --> 01:11:47,069
Did you just spank me?

1273
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:50,639
- Yes.

1274
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:53,075
You had it coming.

1275
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,053
You know who won
the Pulitzer Prize
this year?

1276
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:10,392
-Why?
-You don't. Do you?

1277
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:12,761
Who won the hurdles
in the Olympics?

1278
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:15,764
-Men's or females'?
-You don't know?

1279
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,969
Best in
the whole world

1280
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:23,739
and they haven't
affected you once.

1281
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:26,909
No Olympic hurdler's
ever affected anyone.

1282
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:29,345
You know, Grandma's
not good at anything.

1283
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:31,046
She's not good at a thing.

1284
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:34,483
And you told me
that she's affected you

1285
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:37,052
the most out of
any person
in your whole life.

1286
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:41,824
I'm the only one
who knows that.

1287
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:43,492
I guess I wanna be
somebody like that.

1288
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:22,798
Huh?

1289
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,441
Oh. Hi.

1290
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:35,511
Hey. I'm locked out.

1291
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:37,946
Uh, okay. I'll come
wait with you.

1292
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:45,187
-Hey.
-Hey.

1293
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:50,759
I'm not locked out.
I just wanted to
see your face.

1294
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:51,727
Oh.

1295
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:54,563
Ouch. Sorry about that.

1296
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:58,600
Yeah. Uh, it's okay.
My mom did some of it.

1297
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,502
It's kinda been
one of those nights.

1298
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:01,870
Freezing my tits off.

1299
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:03,505
My nipples are about to
rip through my shirt.

1300
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:07,843
Um, do you wanna...

1301
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:09,978
-Wanna go inside?
-Yeah, sure.

1302
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:17,719
What happened in here?

1303
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:20,556
Oh. Uh... Shh.
We had this big party.

1304
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:25,994
Oh, um...

1305
01:14:25,994 --> 01:14:29,865
Speaking of parties,
Aisley's throwing this
big, uh, beach party

1306
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:33,035
like a funeral party
for Maria's resurrection.

1307
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:35,504
It's kind of your party, too.

1308
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:38,140
Yeah. Yeah. I like...
I like parties.

1309
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:40,042
Okay.

1310
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,213
Hey, Anastasia.

1311
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:46,782
I'm really sorry that I put
my name in your boyfriend's
phone number entry.

1312
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:49,785
Good.

1313
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:52,087
You must have some
pretty big balls to
pull off a stunt like that.

1314
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:54,957
No, I don't have balls.

1315
01:14:56,225 --> 01:14:58,193
I do have balls.

1316
01:14:58,193 --> 01:15:01,096
I don't have
metaphorical balls,
but I do have testicles.

1317
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:03,098
Right.

1318
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:11,206
Human sex series?

1319
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:13,642
Uh, that's a sex book
my mom gave me.

1320
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:15,077
She's teaching me
to be a badass.

1321
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:21,016
These people look like
they're depressed.

1322
01:15:23,552 --> 01:15:25,087
I'm pretty sure
whoever wrote this book

1323
01:15:25,087 --> 01:15:27,856
never had actual
enjoyable sex before.

1324
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:28,757
Yeah.

1325
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:30,759
What would that
even look like?

1326
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,563
Uh, something like this.

1327
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:37,833
Ah!

1328
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:46,074
Why? What would...
What would your
sex face look like?

1329
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:51,280
Oh, wow.

1330
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,850
I think
maybe the book's right.

1331
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,952
Is there anything
your mom doesn't
teach you?

1332
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:59,121
No. No.

1333
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:01,256
No, she's really thorough.

1334
01:16:01,256 --> 01:16:02,658
She's pretty much
my best friend.

1335
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:17,139
Did your mom teach you
how to do that?

1336
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:18,807
No.

1337
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:23,345
No. I usually
practice on my hand.

1338
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:26,114
- That was way better.
- That was way better.

1339
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:27,215
Oh, wow.

1340
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:31,954
Wow. That was pretty great.

1341
01:16:31,954 --> 01:16:34,289
I think I'm gonna pass out.
 Oh.

1342
01:16:42,064 --> 01:16:43,865
Does this mean
we're together now?

1343
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:46,935
No, Liam,
we're just friends.

1344
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:49,638
Oh.

1345
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:52,240
Wow, my first girlfriend
and breakup in 30 seconds.

1346
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:54,276
Friends who kissed.

1347
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:56,812
-Hmm.
-Twice.

1348
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:01,950
Oh.

1349
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:04,753

01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:11,186
-No, just hold on
one second. Just...
-It felt...

1368
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:14,089
-It felt inappropriate,
could be the word...
-Just wait for it.

1369
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:17,092
-...because I... I...
-And...

1370
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:21,396
- You know your bells.
- Oh, yeah, well...

1371
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:23,865
That bell means
it's officially summer,

1372
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:26,001
which means I'm no longer
you son's principal.

1373
01:18:29,404 --> 01:18:32,374
- Oh!
- Hmm.

1374
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:43,118
Still 53 minutes left.
Wanna check anything over?

1375
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:44,086
Nope.

1376
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:46,188
Cocksucker.

1377
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:50,058
Wow, did you plan
that out?

1378
01:18:50,058 --> 01:18:52,060
Actually, I did. Yeah.

1379
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:56,164
Uh, I saw you come in
and I got the secretary
to ring the bell.

1380
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:58,900
It's 1:15. These kids
are confused. In get!

1381
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:01,269
The class is still going.
Guys! Guys!

1382
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:03,105
Class is still in.
That was a mistake.

1383
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:05,941
Martin. Martin? Martin?
Put your... Martin!

1384
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:09,144
Put your phone
back in your pocket
and get back into class.

1385
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:22,924
Go ahead. Open it.

1386
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:24,192
You already opened it.

1387
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:25,393
You double-aced it.

1388
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:27,829
-I know.
-Oh!

1389
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:31,166
I can't wait to visit
my little baby in Cambridge.
Sorry, little man.

1390
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:34,269
Why are you all dressed up?
Are you going out with
that principal man again?

1391
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,104
No. Slash yes.

1392
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:39,441
What do you think when
I say the word "Trojan"?

1393
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,510
None of your business.

1394
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:42,811
But do you really
wanna know?

1395
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:43,912
No. No.

1396
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:53,121
- Yahoo!
- It's beautiful!

1397
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:54,790
-Honey.
-Mmm.

1398
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:57,092
Try putting a hot dog stand
right next to a gym

1399
01:19:57,092 --> 01:19:59,795
or an ice cream shop
next to a health food store.

1400
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:02,097
You see the key is
to combine torture
with pleasure.

1401
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:06,067
You know, I always
wanted a sister,

1402
01:20:06,067 --> 01:20:08,370
but the only thing
I got was Maria here
and I mean, he's terrible.

1403
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:11,807
You guys wanna make out?

1404
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,341
-I'm game.
-I'm game.

1405
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:14,543

No. No, I don't.

You know, I got
kicked out of that one.

01:20:57,419 --> 01:20:59,421
Uh, yeah. I saw.

Maria Sanchez.

- Well, it's nice
to meet you.

1430
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,476

- Yes. Yes.

-To make some friends.
-No.

That's awesome.
