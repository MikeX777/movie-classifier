<i>FIRST TO FIGHT</i>
PATROL LEADER

2
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:43,387
 Guadalcanal.   September 1942.

3
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,243
The war has begun,

4
00:01:45,618 --> 00:01:48,313
but the Marines concentrated
in a narrow perimeter,

5
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:50,243
have aged beyond their years.

6
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:52,611
The reinforcements are not
not yet arrived.

7
00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:55,516
Food and ammunition are
ammunition are scarce.

8
00:01:56,068 --> 00:01:58,045
 The situation is grim.

9
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:09,340
 Hey, Sarge!
Gunny's coming.

10
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:12,723
- Hello guys!
- Hi!

11
00:02:15,294 --> 00:02:17,223
 Ed Carnavan, what do you think?

12
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:19,103
How are you, Shanghai?

13
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:20,299
 Ah, it couldn't be better.

14
00:02:21,028 --> 00:02:24,355
Yeah.
I brought you some grenades.

15
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,426
 It comes from the heart.

16
00:02:28,168 --> 00:02:30,520
I get that from my mother's side of the family.

17
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,012
Do you need anything else?

18
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:37,475
Yes, a beer, a woman
and a good shower.

19
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,000
I did order a gallon of sake,

20
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,282
we will have it when we return.

21
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:46,412
 - Good.
 - This could be good.

22
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,900
For a gunnery sergeant.

23
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:50,804
Did you put a fence there?

24
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:53,744
Yes, Grandma and I have
hung boxes on it

25
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:54,837
 and some grenades.

26
00:02:55,431 --> 00:02:56,962
 If they come, we will hear them!

27
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,580
 If they come?

28
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:01,598
 They have at least one battalion.

29
00:03:02,426 --> 00:03:03,926
 You'd better track them down.

30
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,149
If you're overwhelmed, you'll have to go home.

31
00:03:07,615 --> 00:03:08,615
we will protect you.

32
00:03:09,309 --> 00:03:12,450
Crossing 500m in enemy territory
territory and at night?

33
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,938
 Mmm Shout, we'll get you through.

34
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,318
It will be a long night.

35
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:22,838
Slowly.

36
00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:33,634
Now!

37
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:59,102
Let's go !

38
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,127
Shoot!

39
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,495
 Sarge!
They made it through.

40
00:09:10,538 --> 00:09:11,626
 Come on!

41
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:18,700
 Come on!

42
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,460
 Come on.

43
00:10:57,136 --> 00:11:00,071
So, it was tough
last night, Sarge.

44
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,820
Sir.

45
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:03,803
I said you had work to do.

46
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:10,615
 Yes, sir,
but it was hard to fail.

47
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:11,915
 Yes.

48
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:15,123
Sorry, sir,
I can't hear you very well.

49
00:11:15,447 --> 00:11:19,706
I understand,
you did a good job.

50
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,065
 Yes, so are they.

51
00:11:29,687 --> 00:11:32,608
 I suggest you go to the back

52
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:34,636
 take hot food and coffee.

53
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,147
 Thank you.

54
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:12,177
Hey, Shanghai!

55
00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:19,866
 Is this all that's left?

56
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:21,907
Uh, well, it lasted a while,

57
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:24,293
We need to get older.

58
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:28,306
 Or we get smart,
It tastes like varnish.

59
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:29,866
 No one is forcing you to drink.

60
00:12:30,271 --> 00:12:31,713
That's all there is to it.

61
00:12:36,446 --> 00:12:37,493
 Sergeant Connell!

62
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:40,491
What's up?

63
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:42,494
Colonel Baseman is waiting for you
is waiting for you at HQ.

64
00:12:42,766 --> 00:12:44,210
He said to bring you there.

65
00:12:44,568 --> 00:12:47,195
I don't have another outfit.

66
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:49,353
I am only reporting his words to you.

67
00:12:49,806 --> 00:12:51,935
Well, it's done.
  Disappear!

68
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:56,653
What's so funny about it?

69
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,628
Funny?

70
00:12:59,024 --> 00:13:01,939
 Come on, talk.
You know something.

71
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:06,589
No, no! I am surprised,
take your stuff, I'll go with you.

72
00:13:06,697 --> 00:13:08,540
What is it about?

73
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,704
 Hey, I don't know anything,
 I'm just a gunnery sergeant.

74
00:13:12,588 --> 00:13:15,619
Yes, it's written there,
but you know everything before.

75
00:13:16,026 --> 00:13:17,720
Do you really want to keep the old man waiting?

76
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:29,637
And I suggest another one here.
Let's take a look.

77
00:13:30,488 --> 00:13:32,535
Yeah, that's good, great.

78
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,656
Colonel, you wanted to see me?

79
00:13:35,735 --> 00:13:37,878
Yes, come on Sergeant, come on.

80
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,673
At ease.
We just refreshed my cup.

81
00:13:42,794 --> 00:13:46,355
I hate it when it starts
to look like a bush.

82
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:49,857
This is a problem that apparently
you will never have.

83
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:53,004
How long have you been
have you been a Marine, Sergeant?

84
00:13:53,474 --> 00:13:55,059
 More than seven years.

85
00:13:55,441 --> 00:13:57,340
 You're going to be thirty, right?

86
00:13:57,562 --> 00:13:58,801
 Yes, if I'm lucky.

87
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:03,930
Sergeant, this war is very
hard for my platoon leaders,

88
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:06,219
I'm missing four right now.

89
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:09,650
So, put this on Lieutenant!

90
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:14,076
I am making you a second lieutenant.

91
00:14:14,196 --> 00:14:16,870
I know it's less
than platoon sergeant

92
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,034
but we all have to make sacrifices.

93
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,293
It's official, the papers
will come from the division.

94
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:26,340
I don't care, Colonel,
 I don't want to leave my group

95
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:29,433
You see, what you
and what I want,

96
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:31,925
 have nothing to do with it.

97
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:36,018
 Jack, this war has just begun.

98
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,417
Many, or should I say some
say some in the US,

99
00:14:39,442 --> 00:14:42,403
 have no idea what
what it is all about.

100
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:45,919
So, Washington, the High
command, the War Department

101
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:48,722
would like to know how to
enlighten these people.

102
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:52,519
 In one week,

103
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:55,562
you will receive the medal
of honor of the congress.

104
00:14:56,036 --> 00:14:57,301
Washington.

105
00:14:58,003 --> 00:14:59,995
They will hang the
medal around your neck,

106
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,824
will put you in a cage, will walk you
walk you through the country

107
00:15:02,857 --> 00:15:05,863
to show the citizens
a hero in the flesh.

108
00:15:06,418 --> 00:15:07,734
 What do you think?

109
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,976
Sorry Colonel, I'm not that kind of guy.
I'm not that kind of guy.

110
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:13,984
 Major!
Help him to put on these barrettes.

111
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:16,382
I hate it when a man
is not in uniform.

112
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,622
 This sake rises quickly,

113
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:30,799
I loosen my leggings

114
00:15:31,823 --> 00:15:33,964
 Hey, it looks good on you.

115
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:36,971
- I want to be the first.
- Ah, stop.

116
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:40,729
Don't pretend,
you knew it all along.

117
00:15:40,754 --> 00:15:42,429
 I've heard rumors.

118
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:47,046
Ah, damn it! America, do you know
how many single women there are?

119
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:49,625
I'll try to find out.
I'll tell you.

120
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:52,487
I didn't really have a choice.

121
00:15:52,547 --> 00:15:54,378
Who needs it?
You did.

122
00:15:54,775 --> 00:15:56,038
I was getting used to this place.

123
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,495
You'll get used to Washington. Force yourself.

124
00:16:02,768 --> 00:16:04,198
 Take care of yourself, Jack.

125
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:06,869
 Yes, I will be free soon,
 I will be back.

126
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,424
Keep a low profile here.

127
00:16:08,921 --> 00:16:10,809
No one will take my
my beer ration.

128
00:16:13,964 --> 00:16:15,667
- Come on Mike!
- Yes sir.

129
00:16:16,603 --> 00:16:18,197
They call me "Sir".

130
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:54,716
At the suggestion of your
commander, Colonel Baseman

131
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:58,891
and recommends to the United States Congress

132
00:16:59,008 --> 00:17:00,624
 and approved by him.

133
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:06,372
It is with great pleasure that I
to present you with this medal.

134
00:17:06,856 --> 00:17:09,109
 The nation's highest honor,

135
00:17:09,856 --> 00:17:13,473
that you have deserved by your
services rendered to your country.

136
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,277
 Thank you, Mr. President.

137
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:19,356
Lieutenant, gentlemen,
I assure you that this is

138
00:17:19,381 --> 00:17:22,622
 a ceremony that I am deeply pleased about.

139
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:28,280
And if the dog does not echo
the echo of my feelings,

140
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:32,731
it's just because he is
Scottish and taciturn.

141
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,461
Now I leave you to the
press, with a warning:

142
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:40,323
Sometimes they are more difficult
than the enemy.

143
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:51,531
 Lieutenant.
A few questions.

144
00:17:52,436 --> 00:17:54,599
 Gentlemen, gentlemen, please!

145
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:57,014
Gentlemen, they have just
just arrived and are tired.

146
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,185
You can do the interviews later.
interviews later.

147
00:17:59,256 --> 00:18:02,568
Now I would like to say
something on their behalf.

148
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:04,883
They did not leave their
units with pleasure,

149
00:18:04,908 --> 00:18:06,834
but of course they are
happy to be home.

150
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:08,670
Tell us why they are at home.

151
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:11,523
The departure? The war...
Will they go back to the fight?

152
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:13,500
 Not now.
They've had their share.

153
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:16,872
They will go around the country
to sell war bonds.

154
00:18:17,088 --> 00:18:19,182
 I don't understand,
how the war heroes...

155
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,148
 Gentlemen, gentlemen, please!

156
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,306
Come on, Jack.

157
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:30,488
 What is your impression, Lieutenant?

158
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:34,382
Good,
it's good to be home,

159
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,876
 I'm just happy to be here.

160
00:18:50,686 --> 00:18:53,240
They could have put some women on the
women in the welcoming committee.

161
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:56,274
- There will be some on the road.
- But what will I do tonight?

162
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:59,212
 Gentlemen, I'm glad you're ready.

163
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,844
 Ms. Sanford.

164
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,048
 Thank you, Captain.

165
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,094
- Hey guys!
- Your attention please.

166
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,227
But, how so!

167
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:06,781
 My name is Peggy Sanford,

168
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:08,358
I will be with you
during the trip.

169
00:19:08,383 --> 00:19:11,336
I will take care of the program and
hotel reservations, everything.

170
00:19:11,673 --> 00:19:13,696
A kind of secretary, or prescription.

171
00:19:13,914 --> 00:19:15,009
 Any questions?

172
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,914
I have one: what are you
are you doing tonight?

173
00:19:18,352 --> 00:19:20,282
I'm going to sleep, lieutenant,
just like you,

174
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,750
You will be tired.

175
00:19:22,043 --> 00:19:25,172
We fly to Pittsburgh this afternoon,
then on to Detroit and Chicago.

176
00:19:25,526 --> 00:19:27,172
Here are your copies of the program,

177
00:19:27,326 --> 00:19:29,322
 any other questions... about the trip?

178
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:30,950
 No ?  Good.

179
00:19:32,026 --> 00:19:35,143
We will see you in the
in the lobby at 12:00.

180
00:19:35,328 --> 00:19:37,580
Your luggage has already been shipped.

181
00:19:38,112 --> 00:19:40,338
 Thanks, and see you later.

182
00:19:46,654 --> 00:19:47,787
 What a pretty girl!

183
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:49,389
Yes, not bad.

184
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:51,044
She quickly put you back in your place.

185
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:52,178
Give me some time.

186
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:55,027
Old Marine saying: "I haven't
haven't started fighting yet."

187
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:56,520
You're not his type.

188
00:19:56,825 --> 00:19:58,428
- Maybe you are?
- Maybe...

189
00:19:59,137 --> 00:20:00,561
 50 bucks says she'll pick me.

190
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,576
 A bet made!

191
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:07,193
Pay now, unless she fell on her head.
has fallen on its head.

192
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,537
 You're sure of yourself, right?

193
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:11,037
- Shall we say $100?
- No. 50 is enough for me.

194
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:12,483
 Thank you, sir.

195
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:40,907
Are you going somewhere?

196
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,183
Oh. Hi Shanghai.

197
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:45,714
 Hey, good landing.

198
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:59,003
 Ms. Sanford.

199
00:21:00,574 --> 00:21:03,441
You're lonely, I thought I'd cheer you up.
I could cheer you up.

200
00:21:03,902 --> 00:21:07,785
If you really want to make me happy, go back to your
go back to your place.

201
00:21:08,361 --> 00:21:11,151
Look, it's going to be a long trip,

202
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:13,872
We're going to be together
anyway. I was thinking...

203
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,127
I know what you were thinking, Lieutenant,
 no way.

204
00:21:16,847 --> 00:21:17,980
Please!

205
00:21:18,587 --> 00:21:20,056
 When you know me better...

206
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:22,863
 Believe me, Lieutenant, I know all about it.

207
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,613
 - Oh, please!
- Bye-bye.

208
00:21:35,764 --> 00:21:38,803
Ah, this woman is
anti-American, and unpatriotic.

209
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:42,164
 Well, Don Juan, your turn!

210
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:43,710
It's the right time.

211
00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:45,062
Are you scared?

212
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:47,813
No, I'm more of a cautious person.

213
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:29,728
Hey, we are put in first class.

214
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,366
 Our guys in uniform deserve the best.

215
00:22:33,514 --> 00:22:36,253
I'm glad you think that about us.
 Excuse me.

216
00:22:36,457 --> 00:22:38,863
- But Lieutenant...
- Call me Jack.

217
00:22:39,487 --> 00:22:41,089
 Call me Miss Sanford.

218
00:22:41,268 --> 00:22:45,226
Ouch. Will we work all the time
all the time in Pittsburgh?

219
00:22:45,888 --> 00:22:48,231
You are sent there to
sell war bonds.

220
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:52,230
Yes, but, always working
makes the warriors sullen.

221
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:54,537
 We could have a little fun.

222
00:22:54,894 --> 00:22:57,558
Don't you know that?
 There's a war going on in the distance.

223
00:22:57,931 --> 00:23:00,844
People shooting at each other,
 stuff like that?

224
00:23:02,786 --> 00:23:04,149
How about dinner tonight?

225
00:23:05,403 --> 00:23:07,231
Good lieutenant,

226
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:09,034
at the hotel,

227
00:23:09,495 --> 00:23:10,977
all together.

228
00:23:16,215 --> 00:23:17,481
Excuse me.

229
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,553
How do you want your 50?

230
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,465
In 10s or 5s?

231
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:38,407
A lot of people together can do
do almost anything.

232
00:23:39,528 --> 00:23:41,152
You can help.

233
00:23:41,313 --> 00:23:43,203
Buy war bonds.

234
00:23:47,972 --> 00:23:49,925
And now, this glorious navy,

235
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:52,285
Heroes of Guadalcanal.

236
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,734
 The pride of the Marine Corps:

237
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:55,785
 "Shanghai" Jack Connell.

238
00:23:57,065 --> 00:23:59,280
Go ahead, marine, it's just
another landing.

239
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:12,015
 Well ... I have some notes here that

240
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,988
I should read it,

241
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,308
in fact I am very afraid to do so

242
00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:38,198
Hello.

243
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:41,799
I wanted to tell you that
it was a good speech,

244
00:24:41,862 --> 00:24:43,010
I liked it.

245
00:24:43,671 --> 00:24:44,811
One point for me.

246
00:24:45,002 --> 00:24:47,041
No, seriously, it was
almost professional.

247
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,797
When you said
that you were afraid.

248
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:49,956
I was afraid!

249
00:24:50,237 --> 00:24:51,979
So you've done a good job of hiding it.

250
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,795
There are many things
that I hide well.

251
00:24:56,436 --> 00:24:58,222
Why don't we talk about it
at dinner tonight?

252
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,362
 A hot dog.

253
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:04,581
 A cherry soda.

254
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:07,362
You are persistent.

255
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,547
This is the first thing
we teach at camp:

256
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,758
 "Focus on the goal."

257
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,752
Well, maybe another day.

258
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:27,429
There is not much I can add
to what others have said... . .

259
00:25:47,478 --> 00:25:50,086
- Jack, open the door!
- There's a Greek man with a present.

260
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:58,570
 Jack, this is Ruby "The Riverer".

261
00:25:58,595 --> 00:25:59,734
 And Rosie "The Riverer".

262
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,304
Two little women who do everything for
this great country and its noble warriors.

263
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,991
Ladies, Lieutenant Jack Connell.

264
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:10,218
Welcome to our website.

265
00:26:13,186 --> 00:26:14,639
What are you doing, finish getting dressed.

266
00:26:14,671 --> 00:26:16,920
I have reservations
in an incredible box

267
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:20,139
probably the worst in San Francisco,

268
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:22,695
but they serve glasses
this big, um... Arrive!

269
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,069
But not tonight, tomorrow?

270
00:26:24,094 --> 00:26:26,053
Tomorrow we'll be in
Seattle, you idiot.

271
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:28,969
The place is warm,
and I found two hot irons there.

272
00:26:29,778 --> 00:26:31,537
Sorry, I have other plans tonight.

273
00:26:31,562 --> 00:26:32,701
Oh, come on!

274
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,842
Well girls,
 the marines are paying for it.

275
00:26:38,152 --> 00:26:40,293
Ah, it will be a long trip,
we need one for the road.

276
00:26:40,318 --> 00:26:41,591
- Negative.
- Let's see!

277
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:42,786
It is reserved.

278
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,556
 Okay, I'll drink my own poison.

279
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:50,034
 Hey, I'm across the street, just in case.

280
00:26:57,259 --> 00:26:59,384
I don't want you to get
a false impression,

281
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:01,829
but you are the only ones
in my room.

282
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:19,496
Hi.

283
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:20,932
Lieutenant...will you come in?

284
00:27:20,957 --> 00:27:23,020
Thank you. I thought we could
could have a drink.

285
00:27:23,356 --> 00:27:26,832
You thought wrong,
 you couldn't be more wrong.

286
00:27:26,857 --> 00:27:28,434
Come on... one little drink can't...

287
00:27:28,459 --> 00:27:29,926
I agree.

288
00:27:29,951 --> 00:27:33,369
But why don't you go
take it with Lieutenant Overman?

289
00:27:33,394 --> 00:27:34,455
 I prefer to stay here.

290
00:27:34,658 --> 00:27:37,258
Sorry, Lieutenant, but
I'm not your type.

291
00:27:37,283 --> 00:27:39,143
Do you think that's my type?

292
00:27:39,168 --> 00:27:42,090
You're young, so find yourself a girl and have
a girl and have fun!

293
00:27:48,087 --> 00:27:50,832
- What kind of woman are you?
- I am not a monster.

294
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:52,754
I am sure you like me.

295
00:27:52,925 --> 00:27:55,770
 You don't know anything about me!
You are young and full of life.

296
00:27:55,795 --> 00:27:58,293
Don't tell me that you have never been
you've never been kissed?

297
00:27:58,699 --> 00:28:03,239
Not by some idiot who thinks that a medal
gives him the right to take everything.

298
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,435
Yeah, by a bullshitter who
wasn't taking any chances.

299
00:28:05,775 --> 00:28:08,660
No, he was the most wonderful man
I have ever known.

300
00:28:09,496 --> 00:28:10,822
He had to know how to do it.

301
00:28:11,004 --> 00:28:12,524
What kind of bait did he use?

302
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,118
One thing you couldn't
understand.

303
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:20,095
 A ring and a promise.

304
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:24,286
 And now...

305
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:31,404
It is not because a guy behaved
as a villain that we should...

306
00:28:35,887 --> 00:28:38,119
 He was an ensign on <i>"the Arizona."</i>

307
00:28:39,028 --> 00:28:40,686
Killed at Pearl Harbour.

308
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:51,655
 I'm... sorry.

309
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:11,754
Behold...the one who failed.

310
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:14,507
 Still trying to win the bet?

311
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:17,344
I didn't even open the bottle.

312
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:19,591
 Honey, it's all yours.

313
00:29:21,544 --> 00:29:23,858
He said you were mine.

314
00:30:16,006 --> 00:30:20,933
 Hey, don't you want to dance?
 I dance really well.

315
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:26,367
I don't know, it's too crowded.

316
00:30:27,474 --> 00:30:29,534
 Hey!
What's wrong with you?

317
00:30:30,649 --> 00:30:33,602
It looks like I'm poison!

318
00:30:35,064 --> 00:30:37,442
You are not the poison, I am.

319
00:30:39,741 --> 00:30:41,830
Here, my share, I'm leaving.

320
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:57,818
Lieutenant, I've been wanting to talk to you
I've been wanting to talk to you...

321
00:30:58,337 --> 00:31:00,680
Here, I'm sorry.

322
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:04,910
Are you inviting me to sit down?

323
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,255
 Thank you.

324
00:31:11,216 --> 00:31:13,314
I think we have
things to say to each other.

325
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,935
 - No doubt that....
- I invite you to dinner?

326
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:19,152
I don't know,
Los Angeles is going to be a tough day.

327
00:31:19,536 --> 00:31:22,166
Lockheed, Douglas, the shipyard...

328
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,810
We'll have to eat!

329
00:31:24,272 --> 00:31:26,223
It's very nice of you to
to take care of my health!

330
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:27,731
Just a suggestion.

331
00:31:30,445 --> 00:31:32,606
So, a nightclub and
a few dance steps?

332
00:31:32,822 --> 00:31:34,443
 Come on, you deserve this.

333
00:31:34,722 --> 00:31:37,259
You really have the
in the ideas!

334
00:31:37,284 --> 00:31:39,067
 I have no interest in giving up.

335
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:43,503
Okay. But no nightclub.

336
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:45,786
Dinner and a movie, right?

337
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,168
I think I have no
strength of character!

338
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:52,295
I'll be right back.

339
00:33:33,748 --> 00:33:37,047
All he wants is to finish
this bottle and three others

340
00:33:37,072 --> 00:33:40,141
and water his garden with champagne
rather than the Germans drinking it.

341
00:33:40,258 --> 00:33:43,619
That should make us feel better about the occupation,
isn't it, Mr. Ricky?

342
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,052
You said it.

343
00:33:45,265 --> 00:33:46,952
They're looking at you, kid.

344
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:13,534
A beautiful song, but
sad like the movie.

345
00:34:15,485 --> 00:34:18,097
Why does everything that is
beautiful must be sad?

346
00:34:18,481 --> 00:34:19,526
Not always.

347
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:24,710
I wonder who
you really are.

348
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,959
Your past. What you used to say?
What you were thinking?

349
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,475
No questions asked.

350
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:32,842
It is not forbidden to try to guess.

351
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:34,296
 Guess what?

352
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:36,858
Why hasn't anyone been there since.

353
00:34:37,067 --> 00:34:38,393
 Since "Arizona"?

354
00:34:39,016 --> 00:34:40,805
You can say it, it's in the past.

355
00:34:40,915 --> 00:34:42,010
So?

356
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:44,374
I won't let that happen again.

357
00:34:45,261 --> 00:34:46,600
 What are you afraid of?

358
00:34:47,366 --> 00:34:49,002
Men who may die tomorrow.

359
00:34:49,694 --> 00:34:52,241
Things that need to be finished before
end before they begin.

360
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,780
What else?
What would you like?

361
00:34:57,077 --> 00:34:59,284
Oh, a nice man with a few dollars,

362
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:01,805
 or a reformed one that is more or less intact.

363
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,327
Someone sure.

364
00:35:03,613 --> 00:35:04,802
It could be me.

365
00:35:06,822 --> 00:35:08,045
The war is not over.

366
00:35:09,261 --> 00:35:10,594
 For me, yes.

367
00:35:11,383 --> 00:35:13,397
I am a veteran by decree.

368
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:16,171
I am labeled:
"Hero, handle with care".

369
00:35:16,773 --> 00:35:18,778
You never know what
what will happen tomorrow.

370
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:22,318
I know what's going on here tonight.

371
00:35:23,386 --> 00:35:25,445
For me... for us.

372
00:35:27,037 --> 00:35:28,795
No, please.

373
00:35:33,073 --> 00:35:35,225
It is also something
you learn in the army...

374
00:35:35,888 --> 00:35:36,982
To be expected.

375
00:35:46,554 --> 00:35:47,561
Allow me.

376
00:35:55,508 --> 00:35:57,420
- Well, good night.
- Thank you.

377
00:35:58,027 --> 00:36:01,125
Jack. Would you like to come in
for a nightcap?

378
00:36:01,949 --> 00:36:03,298
You are forcing my hand!

379
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:11,431
I keep a bottle for
midnight visitors.

380
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:23,251
Is it for dwarfs?

381
00:36:24,172 --> 00:36:26,930
You're lucky that
I kept this from the train

382
00:36:35,316 --> 00:36:36,542
I feel like a chemist.

383
00:36:44,762 --> 00:36:46,464
 They're looking at you, kid.

384
00:36:58,626 --> 00:36:59,863
- No. Why not?
- Why not?

385
00:36:59,962 --> 00:37:01,191
I told you.

386
00:37:01,277 --> 00:37:03,027
Why?
Is it against the rules?

387
00:37:03,392 --> 00:37:05,096
You can't be serious. It's just...

388
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:06,183
 Just what?

389
00:37:07,782 --> 00:37:09,145
You want me there.

390
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,903
 Of course, but that's not all.

391
00:37:12,629 --> 00:37:14,386
 I have nothing else.

392
00:37:14,737 --> 00:37:17,107
You are everything I want,
all I need

393
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:18,908
 Peggy, I love you.

394
00:37:19,018 --> 00:37:20,222
 I want you to be my wife.

395
00:37:27,206 --> 00:37:28,340
I'm afraid.

396
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,078
You shouldn't be afraid,
that's what I'm trying to tell you.

397
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:41,366
I am here with you and
I will always be here.

398
00:37:44,725 --> 00:37:46,098
 Peggy, love me!

399
00:37:47,072 --> 00:37:48,545
 Love me as I love you.

400
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:52,288
I love you that's why I'm afraid.

401
00:38:23,107 --> 00:38:25,013
I owe you $50!

402
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:10,811
 How long will it last?

403
00:39:10,836 --> 00:39:12,889
Until I get older
and you get fat.

404
00:39:29,899 --> 00:39:30,938
 What is it?

405
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:32,766
It's from headquarters.

406
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:34,367
 Jack!

407
00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:36,680
Orders, that couldn't last forever.
last forever.

408
00:39:37,617 --> 00:39:41,110
They want to keep me in New York,
but it won't always be permanent.

409
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:48,369
Go on your own to Camp Pendleton.
to Camp Pendleton.

410
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:50,638
Report to Colonel A.J. Baseman.

411
00:39:50,872 --> 00:39:52,224
He's my former commander.

412
00:39:52,443 --> 00:39:56,146
 Commander of the 1st Battalion
Marines and await orders.

413
00:39:56,511 --> 00:39:57,677
What are you going to do?

414
00:39:58,412 --> 00:40:00,655
Train the marines, I guess.

415
00:40:01,753 --> 00:40:03,186
Won't you get on board?

416
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:06,046
 Good, steady work.

417
00:40:07,652 --> 00:40:11,319
From now on, we are part of the
are part of the garrison.

418
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,183
We will have a small
house, a kind of duplex

419
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:15,671
We will live on the base.

420
00:40:15,995 --> 00:40:17,374
I know you'll like it, Peggy.

421
00:40:17,912 --> 00:40:19,190
 I love you.

422
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:21,254
I love you so much!

423
00:40:21,905 --> 00:40:23,741
If anything should happen to you...

424
00:40:23,957 --> 00:40:25,311
 Not today, not tomorrow,

425
00:40:25,552 --> 00:40:26,819
never.

426
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,965
 - Hello Lieutenant Connell.
- Good to see you, Colonel.

427
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,682
 - Welcome to Pendleton.
- Thank you, sir.

428
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,665
You look good, healthy
in good health.

429
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,884
Does marriage work for you?

430
00:40:48,048 --> 00:40:49,688
Are you already installed?

431
00:40:49,756 --> 00:40:50,866
 Like birds in the nest.

432
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:53,775
Good, good, then we can
get to work.

433
00:40:54,572 --> 00:40:57,447
Colonel, what was the situation like
when you left the guys?

434
00:40:57,734 --> 00:40:59,749
Difficult, the men were exhausted.

435
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:01,384
The army finally came to relieve them

436
00:41:01,409 --> 00:41:03,883
and everyone went to
rest in New Zealand

437
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:06,418
Did you get to see Ed Carnavan?

438
00:41:06,991 --> 00:41:10,119
Yes, I wanted to see it.

439
00:41:11,158 --> 00:41:13,724
He asked me to
to tell you not to come back.

440
00:41:13,749 --> 00:41:15,022
 There is a problem.

441
00:41:16,545 --> 00:41:19,428
He tries to drink all
the sake by himself.

442
00:41:20,517 --> 00:41:22,421
 It's a good marine, the best.

443
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:24,165
Yes, that's right,

444
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,509
 all hands on deck
when we go ashore.

445
00:41:27,132 --> 00:41:28,675
They don't miss anything, do they?

446
00:41:29,682 --> 00:41:30,968
Do you want to come back with them?

447
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:34,753
No sir, I am happily married.

448
00:41:35,303 --> 00:41:36,581
Why look for trouble?

449
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:39,369
Some of us never
never get over it.

450
00:41:39,853 --> 00:41:42,126
I look forward to meeting your wife.

451
00:41:42,314 --> 00:41:43,908
You will like it, it is
is wonderful.

452
00:41:43,939 --> 00:41:47,087
No, no, no, let me
make up my own mind.

453
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:50,883
How about you both come
to dinner at the club with me tonight?

454
00:41:51,413 --> 00:41:53,556
- I take it as an order.
- At 7:00 p.m. sharp?

455
00:41:53,616 --> 00:41:55,298
- We'll be on call.
- All right.

456
00:41:58,419 --> 00:42:00,819
 OFFICERS' CLUB

457
00:42:01,805 --> 00:42:04,432
Yesterday morning, it was a very good group.

458
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:07,275
 What do you think?
 I think that...

459
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,711
 I feel like a civilian.

460
00:42:09,884 --> 00:42:12,501
It's even worse for me,
I am a sergeant at heart.

461
00:42:13,187 --> 00:42:14,712
 Ah, excuse me.

462
00:42:15,985 --> 00:42:17,119
 Jack.

463
00:42:17,283 --> 00:42:18,376
 Yes, Colonel.

464
00:42:18,926 --> 00:42:20,606
My wife.
Wasn't I right?

465
00:42:20,843 --> 00:42:22,801
Report received and verified!

466
00:42:22,867 --> 00:42:25,887
He said you were
pretty, welcome aboard.

467
00:42:26,015 --> 00:42:28,638
Let me introduce you
to the others now.

468
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:32,145
 Gentlemen. Ladies.

469
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:34,286
Lieutenant and Mrs. Jack Connell.

470
00:42:35,567 --> 00:42:38,481
- I welcome you.
- Welcome to the Pendleton estate.

471
00:42:38,506 --> 00:42:40,120
 - You'll regret it.
- I know you will.

472
00:42:40,145 --> 00:42:42,325
You will all have the opportunity
to get to know each other better.

473
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:44,583
Our table is over there.

474
00:42:44,608 --> 00:42:46,883
Excuse me, would you like to follow me?

475
00:42:46,908 --> 00:42:48,258
 - Welcome aboard.
 - Thank you for your time.

476
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:52,376
Gentlemen, what if we put
the pretty girl here, in the middle.

477
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:53,571
Here.

478
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:59,463
What would you like to drink?

479
00:42:59,614 --> 00:43:03,468
 I recommend the Bourbon
or Rum, because that's all it has.

480
00:43:04,203 --> 00:43:07,088
Bourbon is fine and Peggy
takes it with water.

481
00:43:07,136 --> 00:43:08,518
Three Bourbons with water!

482
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:12,040
I am curious to know

483
00:43:12,163 --> 00:43:13,739
this whole thing
of public heroes.

484
00:43:13,764 --> 00:43:16,146
So you're being taken on a tour?

485
00:43:16,945 --> 00:43:19,562
To tell you the truth, Colonel, I was
a little scared at first,

486
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,218
 but that's what they wanted.

487
00:43:21,243 --> 00:43:22,874
 He sold many war bonds.

488
00:43:22,899 --> 00:43:26,360
There's no need to defend him, Ms. Connell,
what he did was important.

489
00:43:26,747 --> 00:43:30,476
Before, he was a good
sergeant with a bit of an attitude.

490
00:43:31,812 --> 00:43:34,436
Now he's a real movie star.

491
00:43:36,503 --> 00:43:38,726
I think you get used to everything, Colonel.

492
00:43:39,442 --> 00:43:40,759
Even to train recruits.

493
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:43,951
No, don't minimize your work Jack.

494
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,357
the training of men
here is important,

495
00:43:46,382 --> 00:43:48,401
and without these vouchers, we
we wouldn't have much.

496
00:43:49,189 --> 00:43:50,577
But you will have to leave early,

497
00:43:50,602 --> 00:43:53,374
tomorrow morning, he should be
with his group at 6am sharp.

498
00:43:53,754 --> 00:43:57,124
Oh, you don't waste time!
Are you married Colonel?

499
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,716
Yes..., I'm married.
 My wife is in Virginia,

500
00:44:02,702 --> 00:44:03,986
 in Quantico.

501
00:44:04,321 --> 00:44:07,232
Do you disapprove of officers
having their wives near them?

502
00:44:07,654 --> 00:44:10,294
 Well I...  I approve of your presence.

503
00:44:11,256 --> 00:44:15,380
I think it will be a great help.

504
00:44:20,635 --> 00:44:22,997
To a new Marine wife

505
00:44:23,724 --> 00:44:25,517
 and has a new marine job.

506
00:44:27,553 --> 00:44:29,580
 Success to you both!

507
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:04,475
 Good morning, sir...  Sergeant Kintall.

508
00:45:04,901 --> 00:45:06,420
 Good morning, Lieutenant Connell.

509
00:45:07,113 --> 00:45:12,683
Attention ! Company,
this is Lieutenant Connell.

510
00:45:13,186 --> 00:45:15,120
 - Good morning, sir!
- Good morning!

511
00:45:15,581 --> 00:45:17,001
What are they doing, Sergeant?

512
00:45:17,193 --> 00:45:18,978
I gave the order to go down the hill,

513
00:45:19,003 --> 00:45:20,706
take position and dig a trench.

514
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:21,871
 With their own means.

515
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:26,378
 Congratulations, that's great.

516
00:45:29,543 --> 00:45:31,409
 What's going on here?

517
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:33,721
That's for one girl,
not for two marines.

518
00:45:58,919 --> 00:46:00,857
Ready to throw grenades!

519
00:46:01,982 --> 00:46:03,258
 Remove the pin.

520
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:06,231
 Launch!

521
00:46:12,321 --> 00:46:13,631
 Get out of the trenches!

522
00:46:22,005 --> 00:46:24,802
Dear Ed: You won't believe
what I'm doing now.

523
00:46:25,611 --> 00:46:27,685
I train recruits at a rapid pace,

524
00:46:28,023 --> 00:46:32,451
I try to turn real rookies into
into marines in 6 weeks.

525
00:46:32,976 --> 00:46:35,404
It's not easy, we do our best
do our best,

526
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:36,701
 I'm not complaining.

527
00:46:37,242 --> 00:46:39,505
 You have the hardest task,

528
00:46:40,908 --> 00:46:42,704
You must take
what we send you

529
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,001
 and put your lives in their hands.

530
00:46:45,732 --> 00:46:48,810
Believe me, we would like to do more, but we don't have the time.
more, but we don't have the time.

531
00:46:49,554 --> 00:46:51,128
 What I can promise,

532
00:46:51,153 --> 00:46:53,615
is that this group will know
the weapons and procedures.

533
00:46:54,834 --> 00:46:56,676
 I would like you to meet Peggy.

534
00:46:57,296 --> 00:47:03,071
She has... Ah, that's a little personal.
Stop it!

535
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:08,893
Time to go.

536
00:47:29,309 --> 00:47:31,199
Ah, you have run again
in the hills!

537
00:47:31,801 --> 00:47:32,900
Can you tell?

538
00:47:32,925 --> 00:47:34,426
When you kiss me like that.

539
00:47:36,942 --> 00:47:38,362
 Should I try again?

540
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:48,649
Ah!
I find the old "Shanghai Jack".

541
00:47:53,703 --> 00:47:55,007
 How was it today?

542
00:47:56,251 --> 00:47:58,117
We sent another group this morning.

543
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,313
 And another one arrived this afternoon?

544
00:48:00,566 --> 00:48:02,422
 Yeah, just kids.

545
00:48:04,433 --> 00:48:06,425
Sometimes I feel like
the guy from the slaughterhouse

546
00:48:06,511 --> 00:48:07,922
to prepare sheep.

547
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,883
Someone has to prepare them.

548
00:48:10,617 --> 00:48:11,669
I guess.

549
00:48:13,672 --> 00:48:14,672
From Ed?

550
00:48:14,899 --> 00:48:16,485
 Yes, I thought you would be surprised.

551
00:48:16,733 --> 00:48:17,828
This is a nice surprise!

552
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:28,516
 Is something wrong?

553
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,321
That's what I was saying...

554
00:48:32,397 --> 00:48:33,708
The kids are good.

555
00:48:34,043 --> 00:48:35,403
They make a lot of effort.

556
00:48:35,778 --> 00:48:38,203
But when we're done teaching them
how to stay alive,

557
00:48:38,411 --> 00:48:39,684
 many are no longer.

558
00:48:39,842 --> 00:48:42,567
 What we need
is real Marines like you.

559
00:48:46,311 --> 00:48:48,795
Tell me about your work.

560
00:48:49,516 --> 00:48:53,194
It will do me good as an
increase in my beer intake.

561
00:48:54,453 --> 00:48:56,016
He could never get enough beer.

562
00:48:56,461 --> 00:48:59,237
We were compensating.
He sends you his greetings.

563
00:48:59,649 --> 00:49:01,094
You'd like it, Peggy.

564
00:49:01,508 --> 00:49:03,470
Not, if it starts to put ideas in your
ideas in your head.

565
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,868
 What ideas?

566
00:49:06,407 --> 00:49:08,110
Jack, you wouldn't be volunteering
volunteer?

567
00:49:08,684 --> 00:49:09,712
Voluntary?

568
00:49:10,089 --> 00:49:12,618
For a change of station.
 For a combat mission.

569
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:24,862
I'm a good Marine,
 but I don't volunteer for anything.

570
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,525
I am a big cat with a fairy tale
fairy tale wife.

571
00:49:29,297 --> 00:49:31,524
 and I won't spoil our happiness.

572
00:49:44,434 --> 00:49:46,355
I have to be back at
base in 30 minutes.

573
00:49:57,697 --> 00:49:59,643
Did they send a courier
to remind me?

574
00:50:03,213 --> 00:50:04,495
 Colonel?

575
00:50:04,975 --> 00:50:06,745
We were about to have lunch,
would you like to come in?

576
00:50:09,321 --> 00:50:12,437
I think that
I prefer to be alone with you.

577
00:50:13,818 --> 00:50:16,520
I have just received the
the last list of the killed:

578
00:50:17,856 --> 00:50:21,309
 Ed Carnavan, in Boungainville,

579
00:50:21,824 --> 00:50:23,166
 Two days ago.

580
00:50:23,918 --> 00:50:26,496
But no, I just
received a letter from him,

581
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:28,824
just now.

582
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:33,402
Unfortunately, sometimes that's just the way things are.
sometimes happen like that.

583
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,504
 I'm sorry, Jack.

584
00:50:50,626 --> 00:50:51,666
 Jack.

585
00:50:53,228 --> 00:50:57,141
Maybe if I had
been there, I could have...

586
00:50:58,156 --> 00:51:03,149
Don't say that, don't even think about it
don't even think about it, you promised.

587
00:51:05,253 --> 00:51:06,666
 Yes, I know.

588
00:51:09,254 --> 00:51:10,620
I promised.

589
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:24,835
Come on, get a move on Marines!

590
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:27,009
Get over that wall!

591
00:51:28,295 --> 00:51:30,772
All right guys,
eat this sand, breathe it in,

592
00:51:31,214 --> 00:51:34,195
crush yourself into the ground.

593
00:51:35,121 --> 00:51:37,527
You!
Do you want to lose your head?

594
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:39,550
Guys do it right!

595
00:51:39,575 --> 00:51:41,472
Don't make me cry!

596
00:51:45,325 --> 00:51:47,692
What's your problem, noodlehead?

597
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,135
Sir, give me a break.

598
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,155
I'll let you breathe this weekend.

599
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:53,747
You are under arrest.

600
00:51:54,418 --> 00:51:55,769
Come on, get moving!

601
00:51:56,638 --> 00:51:58,087
 How long has he been like this?

602
00:51:58,614 --> 00:52:00,302
For two or three weeks, sir,

603
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,933
 it seems to be getting worse.

604
00:52:02,269 --> 00:52:06,336
All those who think they are on
instead of working

605
00:52:07,044 --> 00:52:09,453
I want to see you work!

606
00:52:10,107 --> 00:52:11,489
Come on, let's go!
Get moving!

607
00:52:14,317 --> 00:52:16,398
And Slater says it's gotten
worse this week.

608
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:19,539
Brutal, even sadistic,
crushing these kids to the ground.

609
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,660
And insubordinate.
I requested a report this morning,

610
00:52:22,685 --> 00:52:25,680
He said he would do it when he had
time, that it was crap.

611
00:52:25,705 --> 00:52:27,633
We cannot form
a war council

612
00:52:27,658 --> 00:52:29,969
for a man with a medal
of honor, Captain?

613
00:52:29,994 --> 00:52:30,994
Yes, sir!

614
00:52:31,687 --> 00:52:33,858
"The more you suffer in times of peace

615
00:52:33,883 --> 00:52:36,605
the less you will bleed in wartime".

616
00:52:48,372 --> 00:52:50,351
You have all had your instructions.

617
00:52:51,015 --> 00:52:52,421
This is not a game,

618
00:52:52,492 --> 00:52:54,422
anyone want to try it?

619
00:53:01,694 --> 00:53:02,839
On guard!

620
00:53:10,564 --> 00:53:14,103
If you think you can just crawl away and stay alive
crawl and stay alive,

621
00:53:14,251 --> 00:53:16,008
You have the brains of morons!

622
00:53:16,063 --> 00:53:17,360
You are under arrest!

623
00:53:17,521 --> 00:53:20,579
 Lieutenant!
This is going too far.

624
00:53:23,093 --> 00:53:24,829
- Really?
- Did you say?

625
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,650
Look ahead.

626
00:53:29,368 --> 00:53:31,657
These kids walk until they pick up a ball.
they pick up a ball.

627
00:53:31,682 --> 00:53:33,399
 If you had combat experience...

628
00:53:33,424 --> 00:53:36,892
- You are not the only one who has it!
- Can you prove it?

629
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:40,368
Or are you one of those people who sit behind a desk
think they're fighting a war.

630
00:53:40,393 --> 00:53:41,407
Stop!

631
00:53:41,432 --> 00:53:44,094
- They were excellent marines!
- Shut up! You too!

632
00:53:45,871 --> 00:53:48,305
We have to leave, get in the jeep
the jeep and come back with me.

633
00:53:48,344 --> 00:53:50,071
- Yes, sir.
- replace him, Captain!

634
00:54:16,238 --> 00:54:19,089
I have heard a lot
people talking

635
00:54:19,612 --> 00:54:22,073
tell me, what is the real problem?

636
00:54:24,314 --> 00:54:27,129
You've changed, Jack
and not for the better, I'm afraid.

637
00:54:27,852 --> 00:54:29,711
Is it because of
Carnavan's death?

638
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:31,492
Perhaps in part.

639
00:54:32,297 --> 00:54:37,186
So, I think you're blaming yourself.

640
00:54:37,636 --> 00:54:41,016
Many of us have dear friends who are
friends who are killed.

641
00:54:41,624 --> 00:54:45,352
I know that those you trained are in combat
are in combat and you are not.

642
00:54:45,377 --> 00:54:46,438
Is that it?

643
00:54:46,877 --> 00:54:47,907
 Perhaps.

644
00:54:49,071 --> 00:54:51,718
If you want to go into battle,
why don't you ask?

645
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:53,345
 I can't.

646
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:55,200
Are you afraid?

647
00:54:55,766 --> 00:54:57,701
The colonel knows that this
is not the problem.

648
00:54:57,845 --> 00:55:00,107
So why not
request a transfer?

649
00:55:01,477 --> 00:55:03,946
 Peggy is seeing a doctor,
she is there now.

650
00:55:06,844 --> 00:55:08,113
 Is it serious?

651
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:10,014
We are going to have a child.

652
00:55:11,668 --> 00:55:12,774
 Yes.

653
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:16,481
Then it's serious.

654
00:55:17,422 --> 00:55:20,001
However, it doesn't change anything,
you have to decide.

655
00:55:20,026 --> 00:55:22,352
Either you do your job
here or quit.

656
00:55:22,659 --> 00:55:24,369
I will give the orders
when you say so.

657
00:55:24,629 --> 00:55:26,034
I beg your pardon, Colonel,

658
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:28,680
since when do you
need my permission?

659
00:55:29,953 --> 00:55:32,141
Since you got
that damn medal!

660
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:36,835
That's all.

661
00:55:39,195 --> 00:55:40,287
Yes ma'am, I will tell him.

662
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:48,864
- Lt, it was your wife, she...
- Give me another one.

663
00:55:49,782 --> 00:55:51,384
 - Yes, but she...
- Give me another one.

664
00:56:02,507 --> 00:56:04,754
Jack, I was worried,
it's half past seven.

665
00:56:05,899 --> 00:56:08,977
My program is crap?
Or should I punch the clock?

666
00:56:09,379 --> 00:56:10,789
 No, of course not.

667
00:56:11,069 --> 00:56:13,106
- Stop telling me the time!
- I'm sorry.

668
00:56:15,942 --> 00:56:17,633
 Haven't you had enough to drink yet?

669
00:56:18,164 --> 00:56:20,766
No, I haven't had enough.
I'm not drunk yet.

670
00:56:22,032 --> 00:56:24,465
- Jack, what's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

671
00:56:25,176 --> 00:56:29,278
I drink my bottle in my nest,
under the wings of my little wife.

672
00:56:29,614 --> 00:56:30,895
 This is not fair.

673
00:56:31,077 --> 00:56:33,707
Don't talk to me about justice,
I'm here, right?

674
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:36,418
bound hand and foot by my promises.

675
00:56:36,698 --> 00:56:38,067
- Safe and sound.
- jack.

676
00:56:38,092 --> 00:56:39,528
And I am the nanny of a group...

677
00:56:40,441 --> 00:56:43,644
of barely washed-up kids.

678
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:46,180
Isn't that funny?

679
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:49,559
Being a marine, then a nanny.

680
00:56:51,153 --> 00:56:52,894
 What happened to you?

681
00:56:53,585 --> 00:56:57,934
Nothing, nothing happened to me,
but nothing goes.

682
00:56:58,754 --> 00:57:02,840
I have hot food, clean sheets and
clean sheets and dry clothes.

683
00:57:04,301 --> 00:57:05,648
 I am where you wanted me.

684
00:57:10,003 --> 00:57:12,058
Don't you want to know what
the doctor said?

685
00:57:19,122 --> 00:57:22,409
We're having a baby,
 another attachment,

686
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,823
another promise to keep.

687
00:57:25,078 --> 00:57:29,507
No, you are wrong,
 you're wrong about everything.

688
00:57:30,082 --> 00:57:31,703
 There will be no baby!

689
00:57:36,337 --> 00:57:39,202
 No, I didn't know that, sorry,

690
00:57:40,296 --> 00:57:41,456
We are young.

691
00:57:41,698 --> 00:57:43,356
If you had told me it was negative...

692
00:57:43,738 --> 00:57:45,057
I'm telling you now,

693
00:57:45,096 --> 00:57:47,604
 there will be no baby
 and no more promises.

694
00:57:48,366 --> 00:57:50,026
Not even the ones you made me before.

695
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,127
 Is it true?

696
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:02,257
That's right.
I won't hold you back any longer.

697
00:58:03,968 --> 00:58:05,839
You don't know what
that means to me.

698
00:58:07,143 --> 00:58:08,393
You don't know.

699
00:58:08,808 --> 00:58:10,657
I think I do now.

700
00:58:16,737 --> 00:58:18,286
Is it because you lost the baby?

701
00:58:19,467 --> 00:58:21,050
 Maybe that's part of it.

702
00:58:22,395 --> 00:58:24,674
But there is more than one way
way to lose someone

703
00:58:25,173 --> 00:58:29,470
When we see him tearing himself apart,
 because he can't stand himself anymore.

704
00:58:31,085 --> 00:58:33,346
Let's try to chain it
with a promise,

705
00:58:33,699 --> 00:58:35,886
preventing him from doing
what he wants to do.

706
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,744
 What he has to do.

707
00:58:40,378 --> 00:58:42,979
 We'll get the baby when you come back.

708
00:58:44,505 --> 00:58:46,355
You have to come back!

709
00:58:47,139 --> 00:58:48,932
 I don't want to lose you.

710
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:02,449
Fourth Marine Division,
Maui, Hawaii

711
00:59:07,153 --> 00:59:08,440
 Lieutenant!

712
00:59:11,545 --> 00:59:14,113
- Where is the third "Dog" section?
- On the beach, Captain.

713
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:17,965
We have a rookie from 3rd section,
Would you mind bringing him in?

714
00:59:18,128 --> 00:59:19,528
- Let him come up.
- Yes, sir.

715
00:59:19,637 --> 00:59:20,957
 Bipping, no gymnastics.

716
00:59:25,725 --> 00:59:27,381
 Lieutenant, I am Private Bipping.

717
00:59:43,425 --> 00:59:44,526
Let's go!

718
00:59:44,813 --> 00:59:46,323
Get down and lie down!

719
00:59:57,296 --> 00:59:59,749
If the enemy was in front, you wouldn't have
would not have made 2 meters!

720
00:59:59,964 --> 01:00:01,766
 Keep your stupid heads down!

721
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:03,098
 Sergeant Tweed!

722
01:00:04,057 --> 01:00:05,249
Don't move!

723
01:00:09,883 --> 01:00:12,694
Tweed, Lieutenant Jack Connell,
the new section chief.

724
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:15,272
 It's a pleasure, sir,
 welcome aboard!

725
01:00:15,297 --> 01:00:16,522
Glad to be on board.

726
01:00:17,178 --> 01:00:20,600
Jack "Shangai"!
 The men will be crazy with joy.

727
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:22,983
It looks like you've reached
your first goal,

728
01:00:23,016 --> 01:00:25,123
- I'll leave you with Tweed.
- Very good, sir.

729
01:00:28,201 --> 01:00:29,498
 How does it look, Tweed?

730
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:32,882
It's okay, Lieutenant.
The instructors are veterans,

731
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:35,624
 the guys are tough,
we give them a hard time.

732
01:00:35,649 --> 01:00:38,153
Good. Mason tells me that you
were with the Raiders.

733
01:00:38,178 --> 01:00:39,178
 They were good ones.

734
01:00:40,108 --> 01:00:41,325
We were pretty good.

735
01:00:42,553 --> 01:00:44,311
A Marine is a Marine,
you have to be good.

736
01:00:45,018 --> 01:00:47,318
Good, we'll get along.
Assemble, Sergeant.

737
01:00:48,764 --> 01:00:50,415
Come on guys: Gather round!

738
01:00:54,037 --> 01:00:57,342
 Meet your new boss:
 Lieutenant Jack "Shangai" Connell

739
01:01:03,427 --> 01:01:04,912
 You were at Guadalcanal, Sergeant?

740
01:01:04,937 --> 01:01:07,224
Yes sir, Sgt.
Maypole, 1st Marine.

741
01:01:07,814 --> 01:01:09,795
I thought I had seen you before,
I'm glad to see you.

742
01:01:11,646 --> 01:01:14,373
All right, you already know my name,

743
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,039
 and I will learn yours.

744
01:01:17,827 --> 01:01:19,393
What you may not know,

745
01:01:19,424 --> 01:01:21,838
is that he is preparing a
operation.

746
01:01:22,689 --> 01:01:24,986
I know that we have been through
difficult times,

747
01:01:25,373 --> 01:01:27,268
but we are going to
harder ones.

748
01:01:27,549 --> 01:01:30,644
When we reach this range,
we will be the best section,

749
01:01:31,385 --> 01:01:33,791
it means work,
real work.

750
01:01:34,377 --> 01:01:36,285
So this is a friendly warning.

751
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:40,490
 Prepare to be drooled on. That's all there is to it.

752
01:01:42,005 --> 01:01:44,510
Lieutenant.  
Sergeant Schmidtmer, sir.

753
01:01:44,775 --> 01:01:47,143
I just want to tell you,
we all want to tell you

754
01:01:47,168 --> 01:01:49,158
we are happy to have you
to have you with us.

755
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:50,878
Thank you very much

756
01:01:57,761 --> 01:02:00,453
All right guys, get up!
Let's go.

757
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:12,855
Tweed, in a few days,
they will be ready.

758
01:02:13,902 --> 01:02:16,308
 They're ready, lieutenant,
they will do their job.

759
01:02:17,769 --> 01:02:19,746
If they fail,
we will not have made ours.

760
01:02:19,942 --> 01:02:22,433
 Lieutenant?
A beer?

761
01:02:23,494 --> 01:02:25,168
Come on, come on!

762
01:02:26,907 --> 01:02:29,300
Hey Roy!
Why don't you bring a couple of beers?

763
01:02:30,793 --> 01:02:32,160
 It feels weird.

764
01:02:32,543 --> 01:02:36,019
A whole section that depends on us,
it's not like Guadalcanal.

765
01:02:36,565 --> 01:02:39,433
I've never met a lieutenant
who wasn't like that at the beginning.

766
01:02:39,481 --> 01:02:40,753
It is the responsibility

767
01:02:41,777 --> 01:02:44,253
It's like
new shoes,

768
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:47,168
it takes a while
before they don't hurt anymore.

769
01:02:47,848 --> 01:02:51,043
Look, we have the best Lt.
and the best sergeant in the Marines,

770
01:02:51,074 --> 01:02:53,128
 we will be the best
on the beach, you will see.

771
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,535
I like that about you, Sarge,
no false modesty.

772
01:02:55,586 --> 01:02:56,863
What would be the point,

773
01:02:57,308 --> 01:02:59,152
we are good and we know it.

774
01:02:59,925 --> 01:03:01,212
Let's drink to that!

775
01:03:05,761 --> 01:03:08,378
Lieutenant, I was looking for you
I was looking for you, you have a letter.

776
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,635
 Thank you soldier.

777
01:03:12,628 --> 01:03:13,972
 My wife.

778
01:03:15,456 --> 01:03:17,796
Read it.
Pretend I'm not here.

779
01:03:26,175 --> 01:03:27,625
Is everything okay?

780
01:03:29,378 --> 01:03:30,496
Good for you!

781
01:03:31,032 --> 01:03:34,003
Nothing like a woman to
a good marine on the floor.

782
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:38,496
Not mine.
That's even why I'm here,

783
01:03:38,521 --> 01:03:39,888
she wants what I want.

784
01:03:39,913 --> 01:03:41,738
Ah!
A woman like I love them.

785
01:03:41,763 --> 01:03:43,054
So there are two of us.

786
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:47,648
Look Lieutenant, I was just kidding,

787
01:03:48,527 --> 01:03:51,668
 when you have someone like that,
it's nice to go home.

788
01:03:52,754 --> 01:03:54,259
 Of course.

789
01:04:14,124 --> 01:04:15,753
Do you know "As time goes by"?

790
01:04:15,824 --> 01:04:17,824
- Of course, my lieutenant.
- Can you play it?

791
01:05:46,489 --> 01:05:49,083
Here, just remember
what you have learned.

792
01:05:49,399 --> 01:05:51,997
Run to the beach,
get ashore quickly,

793
01:05:52,285 --> 01:05:55,380
go about two hundred meters
and take the small wood.

794
01:05:55,669 --> 01:05:57,674
If the Japanese do not want to
to give it to us?

795
01:05:57,699 --> 01:05:59,060
 Then persuade them.

796
01:05:59,596 --> 01:06:04,364
You section leaders, stay in touch
with me and Tweed at all times.

797
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:08,255
And when the ramp falls,
disembark at full speed.

798
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:11,122
And don't get your feet caught in your
your feet in your suspenders.

799
01:06:16,708 --> 01:06:18,148
Are you getting cold feet, Bipping?

800
01:06:18,353 --> 01:06:21,761
Sure, I'm shaking,
I can't move!

801
01:06:21,786 --> 01:06:23,861
You'll be fine, no problem.

802
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,935
Just remember
what you have been taught. Okay?

803
01:06:27,161 --> 01:06:29,442
- Thank you, lieutenant!
- Stay close to me, boy!

804
01:07:17,683 --> 01:07:19,430
Come on! Move it!

805
01:07:43,206 --> 01:07:45,100
Come on, Bipping, move!

806
01:08:35,562 --> 01:08:37,976
 Lieutenant!
Lieutenant!

807
01:08:44,558 --> 01:08:46,297
Come on guys, let's get out of here!

808
01:08:47,804 --> 01:08:49,070
Get up, keep going!

809
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:51,538
 Let's go !

810
01:08:56,562 --> 01:08:58,476
- Maypole!
- Yes sir!

811
01:08:58,632 --> 01:09:00,585
I return to the beach,
the lieutenant is wounded.

812
01:09:00,698 --> 01:09:02,202
 Take them to the woods.

813
01:09:02,231 --> 01:09:04,101
 Come on guys, hurry up.
 Let's go !

814
01:09:04,361 --> 01:09:05,603
Let's get out of here!

815
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:15,281
Lieutenant!
Or are you injured?

816
01:09:19,095 --> 01:09:20,537
 Or are you injured?

817
01:09:22,344 --> 01:09:23,682
 Bipping is dead!

818
01:09:29,818 --> 01:09:31,110
Let's get out of here!

819
01:09:33,492 --> 01:09:34,967
Even if I have to carry you!

820
01:11:03,387 --> 01:11:05,418
- Any sign of the enemy?
- Nothing at all, sir

821
01:11:17,612 --> 01:11:20,192
- What happened to you?
- I don't know.

822
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:25,605
We landed ... and I don't know anymore.

823
01:11:27,387 --> 01:11:31,949
The beach can be tough.
It wasn't like that on Guadalcanal.

824
01:11:32,368 --> 01:11:34,164
It's not that.

825
01:11:36,233 --> 01:11:38,238
I couldn't control myself anymore.

826
01:11:40,649 --> 01:11:43,488
It happens, I guess.

827
01:11:46,027 --> 01:11:49,754
- Let's just forget about it, okay?
- Yeah.

828
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:04,551
Lieutenant, it's the captain, sir.

829
01:12:07,184 --> 01:12:08,184
 This is Connell.

830
01:12:08,832 --> 01:12:10,551
We have achieved the
first objective, Mr.

831
01:12:10,676 --> 01:12:13,113
Jack, intelligence says
that they are massing at the front.

832
01:12:13,138 --> 01:12:14,349
We are revising our plans.

833
01:12:14,454 --> 01:12:16,715
Come here, I'll fill you in.
Done

834
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:19,168
 Understood.
Done.

835
01:12:26,023 --> 01:12:27,098
 Tweed.

836
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,745
We think there may be
a counterattack.

837
01:12:35,011 --> 01:12:36,488
 I go back to the PC.

838
01:12:37,738 --> 01:12:39,046
Of course.

839
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:44,323
I want you to understand,
 I'm going back out there to get orders.

840
01:12:45,117 --> 01:12:47,828
Put some barbed wire over there
and stand by.

841
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,425
Yes sir!

842
01:12:52,054 --> 01:12:55,860
All right guys,
put some barbed wire on that side!

843
01:12:56,516 --> 01:12:58,172
- Maypole!
- Yes sir!

844
01:12:58,296 --> 01:12:59,985
Form a detachment
with a few men.

845
01:13:00,276 --> 01:13:02,868
 Linch, MacLane, Roy, let's go!

846
01:13:08,344 --> 01:13:09,524
- Miller.
- Yes.

847
01:13:09,549 --> 01:13:10,902
Two scouts there!

848
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:23,418
Hey! Did you see what happened
to the lieutenant on the beach?

849
01:13:24,445 --> 01:13:26,567
You're kidding, I only saw the sand.

850
01:13:26,637 --> 01:13:28,285
He got the chips.

851
01:13:29,895 --> 01:13:31,433
I've been there too.

852
01:13:31,458 --> 01:13:33,442
 Yes, but you are not the lieutenant.

853
01:13:33,692 --> 01:13:35,699
I'm telling you, he chickened out.

854
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:38,900
It's a good thing the sergeant was there.

855
01:13:40,517 --> 01:13:42,390
This guy got a medal.

856
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:45,207
Maybe he is nice to his mother.

857
01:13:45,677 --> 01:13:47,609
A hero like that, I leave it to you.

858
01:13:51,785 --> 01:13:54,277
Call the company "Charlie",
tell them to be ready.

859
01:13:54,551 --> 01:13:55,996
You asked for me, sir?

860
01:13:56,254 --> 01:13:58,147
I am very happy that
you are here, come on.

861
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:02,022
In fact, we have
the plans,

862
01:14:02,163 --> 01:14:05,269
I don't need to tell you
that the hardest part is yet to come.

863
01:14:06,167 --> 01:14:09,230
We'll put ourselves
like this.

864
01:14:09,817 --> 01:14:11,207
Bill's section here,

865
01:14:12,004 --> 01:14:13,996
 Robby's here, and yours here,

866
01:14:14,082 --> 01:14:16,113
just on the line that
to the Delman ridge.

867
01:14:16,899 --> 01:14:19,142
Officially it is
is called the 2-3-0 ridge.

868
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:21,126
The information speaks about caves,

869
01:14:21,151 --> 01:14:22,777
many with machine guns.

870
01:14:23,527 --> 01:14:25,847
We wanted to go around it
and cut it,

871
01:14:26,443 --> 01:14:29,472
but the Japanese prepare a counter-attack
counter-attack on our two flanks,

872
01:14:29,497 --> 01:14:31,707
which means that we will have to
will have to take this ridge.

873
01:14:32,683 --> 01:14:34,988
You'll have to take it, Jack.

874
01:14:35,652 --> 01:14:38,957
There is a rocky spur in front of the
the ridge, you can use it.

875
01:14:39,105 --> 01:14:41,785
Let me know when you get there,
we'll do a barrage.

876
01:14:42,548 --> 01:14:46,400
Start at dawn,
 6:35 a.m.

877
01:14:52,611 --> 01:14:53,736
 Okay, sir.

878
01:14:58,462 --> 01:14:59,678
 Is something wrong?

879
01:14:59,901 --> 01:15:00,940
 No, sir.

880
01:15:01,478 --> 01:15:03,194
Look, if you're not up for it...

881
01:15:03,285 --> 01:15:04,366
It's going well.

882
01:15:06,204 --> 01:15:08,110
Jack, this ridge is
of primary importance,

883
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:10,410
you have nothing to prove,

884
01:15:11,060 --> 01:15:13,750
if you don't feel up to it
we can replace you.

885
01:15:15,047 --> 01:15:16,691
Anything else, sir?

886
01:15:17,287 --> 01:15:20,102
Mortars will support
your progress,

887
01:15:20,188 --> 01:15:21,982
this is all we have.

888
01:15:22,225 --> 01:15:23,335
Any questions?

889
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:24,676
No, sir.

890
01:15:24,912 --> 01:15:26,387
So, good luck!

891
01:16:50,854 --> 01:16:52,459
I'm a little nervous,

892
01:16:53,502 --> 01:16:56,490
 this is my... first fight

893
01:16:58,150 --> 01:16:59,826
This should not be new to you.

894
01:17:02,264 --> 01:17:03,550
Do you have a fiancée, boy?

895
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:08,244
 Mmm, yes sir, and very pretty too.

896
01:17:12,283 --> 01:17:13,440
 Where are you from?

897
01:17:13,887 --> 01:17:16,519
From Southern Ohio, Nelsonville.

898
01:17:17,128 --> 01:17:18,331
It's nice there.

899
01:17:18,889 --> 01:17:19,889
More than here.

900
01:17:22,389 --> 01:17:23,995
 Everything is better than here.

901
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:28,471
 What are you doing there?

902
01:17:28,643 --> 01:17:29,673
Sorry?

903
01:17:32,209 --> 01:17:34,451
At home, with your fiancée.

904
01:17:36,147 --> 01:17:37,147
Not much.

905
01:17:38,506 --> 01:17:40,642
 Picnics, movies

906
01:17:42,088 --> 01:17:43,719
and we often sin.

907
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:47,142
For a girl,
she does very well with trout.

908
01:17:56,325 --> 01:17:57,970
I think that's very nice, Lieutenant.

909
01:18:00,025 --> 01:18:01,135
 What?

910
01:18:04,672 --> 01:18:06,505
Trying to make me forget about it.

911
01:18:09,511 --> 01:18:11,616
Yes, don't think about it anymore.

912
01:18:17,838 --> 01:18:19,064
 Hey Sarge.

913
01:18:24,424 --> 01:18:25,424
On the right.

914
01:18:27,708 --> 01:18:28,946
The company "Charlie".

915
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:47,330
 This is not the "Charlie" company.

916
01:18:49,588 --> 01:18:51,088
Get ready, here they come!

917
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:52,783
Pass it on!

918
01:18:52,956 --> 01:18:54,385
 Here they are. Pass it on!

919
01:18:55,855 --> 01:18:56,996
Get ready!

920
01:19:03,955 --> 01:19:07,244
They are ahead, Lieutenant, they are coming.

921
01:19:08,088 --> 01:19:10,306
Call the PC!
Warn them.

922
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:15,317
 Red Dog, this is Red Dog 2, over.

923
01:19:37,008 --> 01:19:39,842
Red Dog, this is Red Dog 2, come in, over.

924
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:58,229
 Red Dog, Red Dog, this is Red Dog 2,

925
01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:01,441
can you hear me? over to you!

926
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:08,158
This is Red Dog 2, over to you.

927
01:20:50,482 --> 01:20:52,264
 Come on Jack!

928
01:21:31,343 --> 01:21:32,968
 Red Dog, this is Red Dog.

929
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,369
Clean them well.

930
01:22:44,394 --> 01:22:46,301
 We may need it soon.

931
01:22:56,302 --> 01:22:57,967
You fought well last night.

932
01:22:59,787 --> 01:23:01,584
What happened to the Marine hero?

933
01:23:01,849 --> 01:23:03,339
Are we going to offer him another medal?

934
01:23:04,153 --> 01:23:07,233
- Get your men ready, we're moving.
- They are ready!

935
01:23:08,452 --> 01:23:10,522
 Hey Sarge, talk to your coward

936
01:23:10,547 --> 01:23:12,989
tell him it's a pleasure
to have him as a leader.

937
01:23:13,014 --> 01:23:14,342
Do you want my fist
in the face?

938
01:23:15,647 --> 01:23:16,959
Coming from you, that's okay.

939
01:23:29,861 --> 01:23:32,811
We will set off at 6:35 am,
we will go to the rocky spur.

940
01:23:33,725 --> 01:23:35,429
 Lieutenant, we need to talk.

941
01:23:36,185 --> 01:23:38,050
Your company's morale is low.

942
01:23:38,633 --> 01:23:40,358
- They will get over it.
- Sure!

943
01:23:40,631 --> 01:23:42,920
 It should start with you,
what's the problem.

944
01:23:43,067 --> 01:23:44,739
You can't understand.

945
01:23:45,636 --> 01:23:48,972
Talk to me, I've been in
the body for a long time.

946
01:23:48,997 --> 01:23:50,218
 Nothing to do with the Marines.

947
01:23:50,243 --> 01:23:51,731
Stop it!
What's wrong with you?

948
01:23:51,905 --> 01:23:53,376
 It's up to me to solve it.

949
01:23:53,401 --> 01:23:55,233
I know how things are
in high places.

950
01:23:55,415 --> 01:23:56,818
We may have inflated
your exploits,

951
01:23:57,006 --> 01:24:00,350
but we don't give the congressional medal
to change diapers.

952
01:24:00,375 --> 01:24:01,819
Why don't you fight?

953
01:24:01,947 --> 01:24:04,358
- You're out of line, Sergeant.
- It's not me, it's you.

954
01:24:04,561 --> 01:24:08,069
A sergeant who does what you did yesterday
yesterday, I'll court-martial him!

955
01:24:08,094 --> 01:24:09,600
Enough is enough!
Get ready to leave.

956
01:24:10,576 --> 01:24:11,700
 This is an order.

957
01:24:13,408 --> 01:24:14,574
Yes, sir.

958
01:24:16,770 --> 01:24:19,162
Come on, get ready to go!

959
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:22,827
- Lynch!
- Sir!

960
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:41,334
Here we are, Lieutenant.

961
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:43,523
Delman Ridge.

962
01:24:45,452 --> 01:24:46,975
- Get me Lynch!
- Yes sir.

963
01:24:56,725 --> 01:24:58,592
Go back there and
and get them to safety.

964
01:25:04,687 --> 01:25:06,717
 Red Dog 1, this is Red Dog 2, over.

965
01:25:06,885 --> 01:25:08,631
This is Red Dog.
Did you reach the goal?

966
01:25:08,709 --> 01:25:11,725
We have reached the goal sir,
 we are waiting for the barrage.

967
01:25:12,317 --> 01:25:14,959
- The artillery is on its way.
- Yes, sir, over.

968
01:25:17,537 --> 01:25:19,186
 It doesn't look too bad.

969
01:25:22,789 --> 01:25:25,459
There are Japanese in this
cave and this bunker too.

970
01:25:25,908 --> 01:25:27,412
 How to get them out?

971
01:25:28,243 --> 01:25:32,029
This time, do me a favor,
enjoy the show.

972
01:25:32,702 --> 01:25:35,522
- What kind of joke is this?
- Do you want a drawing?

973
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,045
It won't be long now.

974
01:26:01,835 --> 01:26:03,007
It's getting hot.

975
01:26:10,038 --> 01:26:11,452
 What happens?

976
01:26:12,311 --> 01:26:14,561
I'm the same guy from Guadalcanal.

977
01:26:16,006 --> 01:26:18,763
 It was hard there too.
Just as hard as here.

978
01:26:18,959 --> 01:26:22,731
The ancients were right.
The Spartans.

979
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:27,311
First, making your way in the military,
and then marriage.

980
01:26:27,564 --> 01:26:29,108
What does that have to do with it?

981
01:26:29,133 --> 01:26:31,601
You are married now,
don't forget it lieutenant.

982
01:26:33,078 --> 01:26:35,756
In Guadalcanal, you had
you had not started a family,

983
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:38,100
you only had the army.

984
01:26:38,503 --> 01:26:41,818
Red Dog, this is Captain Mason,
answer me, over.

985
01:26:42,475 --> 01:26:44,026
This is Red Dog 2.

986
01:26:44,051 --> 01:26:45,920
 Are you able to move forward?

987
01:26:45,973 --> 01:26:47,584
Yes sir, we are ready.

988
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:50,850
The action moves to your left flank.
After taking the ridge,

989
01:26:50,881 --> 01:26:54,037
wait for the company "Charlie",
they will replace you.

990
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:56,206
 Understood sir, over.

991
01:26:57,910 --> 01:26:59,819
- Have the men move out.
- Yes, Lieutenant.

992
01:26:59,919 --> 01:27:01,905
 Did you hear?
Tell the men to move on!

993
01:27:02,769 --> 01:27:06,731
Let's move guys, move!
 Do it in order.

994
01:27:50,091 --> 01:27:52,122
 We must separate.

995
01:27:52,286 --> 01:27:54,044
Relax, Tweed knows what he's doing.

996
01:27:54,069 --> 01:27:55,739
At least someone knows.

997
01:28:20,052 --> 01:28:21,898
You're in the clear, run!

998
01:28:21,923 --> 01:28:22,953
Move on!

999
01:28:22,978 --> 01:28:25,336
Get moving,
take cover!

1000
01:28:57,022 --> 01:28:59,685
Don't stay in the dark!
Go, go, go!

1001
01:29:53,178 --> 01:29:56,162
Send shooters to these rocks
rocks to attack the bunker.

1002
01:29:57,221 --> 01:29:58,498
 Lieutenant!

1003
01:29:58,907 --> 01:30:01,326
- They will slaughter them!
- We will be massacred here.

1004
01:30:08,490 --> 01:30:10,912
The guys are getting shot,
you have to give orders!

1005
01:30:11,709 --> 01:30:14,404
It's not just your problem anymore,
you are not alone.

1006
01:30:14,635 --> 01:30:16,803
The fear is on your face
face, admit it!

1007
01:30:16,917 --> 01:30:18,338
It's fear! Lieutenant,

1008
01:30:19,287 --> 01:30:21,833
why don't you listen to me?

1009
01:30:23,923 --> 01:30:27,470
Sergeant, Sergeant what were you
were you trying to tell me?

1010
01:30:27,541 --> 01:30:29,993
 That everyone is afraid, afraid!

1011
01:30:30,951 --> 01:30:33,724
Curses!
It's natural, you're afraid.

1012
01:30:34,145 --> 01:30:36,931
 But go ahead! Go for it!

1013
01:30:45,149 --> 01:30:46,543
 Nurse!

1014
01:31:00,570 --> 01:31:03,392
Back up, let's get
out of here, let's get out of here!

1015
01:31:03,447 --> 01:31:06,342
Don't go forward, don't go back,
these wretches will kill you.

1016
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:08,660
- Maypole.
- Mister!

1017
01:31:08,842 --> 01:31:11,628
Take your best men,
on these rocks, go!

1018
01:31:11,807 --> 01:31:13,731
Go ahead, you heard it.

1019
01:31:15,325 --> 01:31:17,560
 On the left, try to
liquidate this cave.

1020
01:31:18,089 --> 01:31:19,802
What are you waiting for, go ahead!

1021
01:31:20,177 --> 01:31:22,216
Let's go !
With me!

1022
01:31:22,224 --> 01:31:23,224
Bazooka!

1023
01:32:27,787 --> 01:32:29,325
- You got it.
- Rockets

1024
01:32:42,389 --> 01:32:43,869
Ammunition!

1025
01:32:58,174 --> 01:33:00,826
 Let's blow them up!
Cover us.

1026
01:33:08,713 --> 01:33:12,291
 We'll keep them busy.
 You'll both go.

1027
01:33:12,354 --> 01:33:13,806
You two come with me!

1028
01:33:13,855 --> 01:33:15,986
Let's get up there.
Let's go!

1029
01:33:34,229 --> 01:33:37,981
Hey! Attention, cease fire!

1030
01:34:00,303 --> 01:34:03,243
Hey....., he did it, let's go!

1031
01:34:09,965 --> 01:34:12,395
- Are you whole?
- I think so.

1032
01:34:15,763 --> 01:34:18,576
What do you want us to do now
do now, sir?

1033
01:34:23,403 --> 01:34:26,226
Secure the ridge,
put a team of shooters on it.

1034
01:34:26,469 --> 01:34:29,648
Okay, sir.
You heard the lieutenant.

1035
01:34:44,899 --> 01:34:46,874
 Hey!
Here you are.

1036
01:34:47,108 --> 01:34:49,498
- How is it going?
- Like a hole in the back.

1037
01:34:51,592 --> 01:34:53,053
Did they do well?

1038
01:34:53,545 --> 01:34:54,800
They were very good.

1039
01:34:55,029 --> 01:34:57,545
You and I can
make a great platoon.

1040
01:34:57,662 --> 01:34:59,004
Can be good.

1041
01:35:00,355 --> 01:35:01,967
What happened to you...

1042
01:35:03,514 --> 01:35:06,604
As you said:
 at Guadalcanal I was alone

1043
01:35:07,006 --> 01:35:09,525
now I have Peggy,
I didn't want her to lose me.

1044
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:13,608
Okay, good thinking.

1045
01:35:14,068 --> 01:35:16,904
Keep it up and you'll be living
for many years.

1046
01:35:17,464 --> 01:35:21,842
He deserves the decoration the one who
was afraid, but did it anyway.

1047
01:35:23,703 --> 01:35:25,240
 Lieutenant Connell?

1048
01:35:26,277 --> 01:35:28,647
Captain Mason wants you
on the other side of the ridge.

1049
01:35:28,944 --> 01:35:30,615
It's bad out there.

1050
01:35:31,099 --> 01:35:33,295
- I'll go there immediately.
- Okay, sir.

1051
01:35:35,006 --> 01:35:38,443
All right guys,
get ready, we're moving!

1052
01:35:40,091 --> 01:35:41,526
"Short war" Lieutenant!

1053
01:35:43,045 --> 01:35:44,475
 "Short War" Gunny.

1054
01:35:44,842 --> 01:35:45,942
 Shanghai...

1055
01:35:50,686 --> 01:35:51,686
Are you afraid?

1056
01:35:53,373 --> 01:35:54,821
Of course I do!

1057
01:36:00,403 --> 01:36:03,232
Come on guys, come on!

1058
01:36:10,328 --> 01:36:11,948
And beyond this ridge,

1059
01:36:11,973 --> 01:36:14,005
 Saipan is waiting to be released.

1060
01:36:14,176 --> 01:36:17,629
 Then Tinian, Guam, Iwo Jima, Okinawa,

1061
01:36:17,708 --> 01:36:20,113
soon sinister and bloody names...

1062
01:36:20,270 --> 01:36:23,160
Some men will come back
and some will not.

1063
01:36:23,471 --> 01:36:27,668
 But the Corps will continue to struggle at
other times for other problems,

1064
01:36:27,725 --> 01:36:30,228
 always ready when the nation calls,

1065
01:36:30,356 --> 01:36:33,207
 always faithful, proud to be the

1066
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,227
 FIRST TO FIGHT.

1067
01:37:09,221 --> 01:37:12,265
