00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,774
<i>Anderson's coming
out fast and furious.</i>

3
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:27,876
<i>And he's just landed a blow on
the forehead of Reiss Gibbons.</i>

4
00:00:27,878 --> 00:00:29,044
<i>He's opened up a cut.</i>

5
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:31,046
<i>That cut
looks deep, Bobby.</i>

6
00:00:31,048 --> 00:00:32,614
<i>It sure does, Jimmy.</i>

7
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,450
<i>Will the Cinderella story
of Reiss Gibbons continue?</i>

8
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:36,618
<i>Can he defend his Legends
Light Heavyweight title</i>

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,120
<i>for a fifth straight time?</i>

10
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:40,022
<i>Or will Anderson
dash his hopes?</i>

11
00:00:47,698 --> 00:00:50,399
<i>Reiss pushes Anderson
to the center of the cage.</i>

12
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:53,469
<i>Anderson is so quick and
so smooth with his kicks.</i>

13
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:55,070
Come on, Reiss.

14
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:57,806
<i>These two men are
putting on one hell of a fight.</i>

15
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:01,076
This has been one of the
most exciting title fights

16
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:04,313
<i>in Legends history.</i>

17
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,748
<i>Max Black has to be pleased
with the way her champion is</i>

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,050
<i>performing tonight.</i>

19
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:09,718
<i>Everybody is on hand
to see this fight.</i>

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,820
<i>It's always an event
when he steps into the cage.</i>

21
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,490
Come on!
Finish him!

22
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:16,658
<i>Anderson is so quick to
firing up those kicks, Bobby.</i>

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,160
<i>Yeah, they're
really starting to open</i>

24
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,262
<i>up the cut above Reiss's eye.
He's knocked him down!</i>

25
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:22,664
<i>Anderson's
right back up.</i>

26
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:26,101
<i>Reiss is relentless.
He stalks Anderson.</i>

27
00:01:26,103 --> 00:01:28,103
<i>He's raining down elbows.</i>

28
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:30,472
He's got him up
against the cage.

29
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:35,410
<i>Wait a minute.
Showtime Kick!</i>

30
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:38,280
Reiss counters with a right hand!
What a fight!

31
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:39,681
<i>Reiss knocked him out!</i>

32
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,250
<i>He knocked him out!</i>

33
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:44,686
- <i>Beautiful right hand.</i>
- <i>Incredible!</i>

34
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,356
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, you
are looking at the number</i>

35
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,591
<i>one fighter on the planet...</i>

36
00:01:49,593 --> 00:01:51,093
<i>The five-time Legends
Light Heavyweight</i>

37
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:52,528
<i>Champion of the World.</i>

38
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,931
Come on!

39
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,376
Reiss, that's five title
defenses in a row now. How are you feeling?

40
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,711
I feel amazing, lad.
Unstoppable.

41
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,780
Anderson opened up that
cut in the beginning of the round.

42
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:13,115
How bad did he hurt you?

43
00:02:13,117 --> 00:02:14,449
You know, he
definitely left his mark.

44
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:16,385
Thank you, Stephanie.

45
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:18,287
What's next
for the five-time champ?

46
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,889
Uh, I'm gonna be a dad.

47
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,057
Have you got any tips?

48
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:28,730
We want to stay in the
Reiss Gibbons business.

49
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:33,569
Five-time champ has a
real nice ring to it.

50
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:38,307
Okay, it's <i>Alien</i> meets <i>Prison
Break</i> set in a space jail.

51
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:39,675
Who would I be playing?

52
00:02:39,677 --> 00:02:41,310
The most dangerous
cop on earth wrongly

53
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:43,845
accused and sent
to space jail.

54
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:44,980
It's a bit cliche, isn't it?

55
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,152
We want to continue protecting
those pearly whites of yours.

56
00:02:50,154 --> 00:02:52,421
That's molded perfectly
to your mouth.

57
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:53,922
How's that feel?

58
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,824
What'd he say?

59
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:57,092
It feels great.

60
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,428
Check this out.

61
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,096
Your own shoe.

62
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:06,368
There aren't very many athletes
with their very own shoe.

63
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,003
<i>Baby Swap.</i>

64
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:11,173
You're a dangerous cop who
swaps bodies with an infant.

65
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:12,841
<i>Hard and Wet.</i>

66
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:15,611
It's <i>Fast and Furious</i>
on a cruise ship.

67
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:19,281
The speed is low, but the
stakes are crazy high.

68
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:21,617
You into this?
Try the gun.

69
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:23,051
When you step out
onto the red carpet,

70
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:24,620
you're going to have the
best smile in show biz.

71
00:04:04,228 --> 00:04:06,928
Hey, babe.

72
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,597
She's done it again.

73
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,333
I told you, you've got to
put the nappy on straightaway.

74
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,501
Oh, shit.

75
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:14,603
She's got a tiny
bladder, baby.

76
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:15,837
I think she's
doing it on purpose.

77
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,506
Of course she's not.

78
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:18,907
Are you?

79
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:21,576
Every time I pick her
up, she pisses on me.

80
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:25,080
I thought footwork
was your thing, big guy.

81
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:26,748
Well, I'm not quick
enough for this one.

82
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,617
Silly lump.

83
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:30,852
That's Marcus.

84
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:32,754
Where's Daddy going?

85
00:04:32,756 --> 00:04:34,423
Is Daddy going to go to work?

86
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:37,693
I love you both.
Bye.

87
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:39,294
Say bye to Daddy.
Bye.

88
00:04:39,296 --> 00:04:41,129
Bye.
Bye.

89
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:42,597
Hm?

90
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,437
We've been working on that.
Come on!

91
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:54,710
Nice throw.

92
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:08,390
Offense, Reiss.
Offense.

93
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,558
Love it.

94
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:17,132
All right.

95
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:19,067
Line up, everyone.

96
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,237
Come on, line up.

97
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:25,741
All right, before everyone goes
home, Reiss, come up here.

98
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:36,585
Been together a long time.

99
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:41,590
You drive me crazy,
but I'm very proud of you. Love you, man.

100
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,025
I love you too, Marcus.

101
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:45,594
All right.

102
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:50,098
Let's welcome back the
five-time Light Heavyweight

103
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,768
World Champion, Reiss Gibbons.

104
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,452
Tomorrow you've got the 10:00
AM with Stevenson's manager.

105
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:12,354
Yep.

106
00:06:12,356 --> 00:06:14,723
I need to make him understand why Domingus
has to be his first title defense.

107
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:15,957
He's really stubborn, Max.

108
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,460
Oh, man, he doesn't
know stubborn.

109
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,128
At 12:00 you need
to be in Birmingham

110
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,863
to meet with Anderson
to renew his contract.

111
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:23,131
Good, good.

112
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,866
Then you fly
straight out to Vegas

113
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:26,902
to sit down with The Nightmare
who's just become a free agent.

114
00:06:26,904 --> 00:06:28,403
He hasn't become
a free agent, Fred.

115
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:31,039
He's become the free agent.
The guy's a monster.

116
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,974
I gotta sign him.

117
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,643
Oh, boy.

118
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:35,744
So how we looking here?

119
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:39,581
20,000 capacity.

120
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,982
Yeah?

121
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:44,553
You think we could fill it?

122
00:06:44,555 --> 00:06:46,054
With a solid
headliner, we can.

123
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,927
Speaking of which.

124
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:53,161
Give me a second.

125
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,996
Yep.

126
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,832
There he is!

127
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:57,999
How you doing, man?
I'm good, Max.

128
00:06:58,001 --> 00:06:59,601
How you doing?
Nice to see you.

129
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:01,002
Good to see you.
Looking good.

130
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,337
Thank you.
You too.

131
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,172
How Reiss doing?
Yeah, he's great.

132
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,007
In phenomenal shape as always.
Of course.

133
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,110
So I got a proposition
for you boys.

134
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:11,346
Go on.
All right.

135
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,848
So now you defended
the title five times.

136
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,283
Now, Reiss has basically
cleaned out the division.

137
00:07:15,285 --> 00:07:17,352
I think the fans
deserve something

138
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,856
really special for the
sixth title defense.

139
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,024
Well, what have you got in mind?
What are you thinking?

140
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,193
Randy Stone.

141
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,195
Who?
Randy Stone, man.

142
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,363
Oh, come on.

143
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,298
He's the current
pro wrestling champ.

144
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,967
Max, that's fake
fighting, isn't it?

145
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:36,137
It's an opportunity for us
to tap in to their audience.

146
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:38,039
So Reiss can do what, jump
off tables and smash people

147
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,374
over the head with chairs?

148
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,543
No, so he can fight
in the Legends cage.

149
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:44,813
Max, look, Reiss went through a murderer's
row to become champ, and you know that.

150
00:07:44,815 --> 00:07:46,147
Yeah.

151
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:47,949
And now you want
to offer a title shot

152
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:50,151
to this random wrestler who's never
even set foot in a cage before.

153
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:52,988
How does that work?
What's Reiss got to lose?

154
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,391
His dignity, his pride,
his self-respect, his fans.

155
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,660
I mean, this guy, what, does
he wear tights for a living?

156
00:07:58,662 --> 00:08:01,897
Come on.
Reggie, think about this.

157
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:07,669
We do this fight, all of Randy
Stone's fans tune into it.

158
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:10,505
Reiss beats the fucking
shit out of him,

159
00:08:10,507 --> 00:08:16,645
and whammo, all of a sudden
Stone's fans are Reiss's fans.

160
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:18,480
Ta-da!
Come on.

161
00:08:18,482 --> 00:08:21,182
Think about Conor McGregor,
right, when he fought Mayweather.

162
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:23,919
Do you know how much money that
guy is making in endorsements?

163
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,520
Oh, yeah.

164
00:08:25,522 --> 00:08:26,922
They are... Millions are
coming out of that guy's ass,

165
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,590
and he didn't even win.

166
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:29,991
Huh?

167
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:31,993
I mean, come on.
Look at that.

168
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:33,929
Reiss, Reiss, Reiss...
he would freak

169
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,997
out all these people, right?

170
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:37,265
He would love it.

171
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,533
I'll see.
I'll let you know, Max. Yeah?

172
00:08:38,535 --> 00:08:40,035
All right.
I'll do my research.

173
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:41,937
Be smart.
Take it easy, Max.

174
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:45,006
All right, I'll give you a call.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:46,441
Fucking managers.

176
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,209
How'd that go?
Yeah, great.

177
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:51,012
Let's go.

178
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:54,015
Nobody in this sport seems
to have any guts anymore.

179
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:57,519
Nobody in this organization
seems to have any guts anymore.

180
00:08:57,521 --> 00:08:59,187
I love this guy.
He's funny, man.

181
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:00,522
Want a drink?

182
00:09:00,524 --> 00:09:02,457
Yeah, I need one
after seeing this shit.

183
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,693
<i>You haven't seen danger yet.</i>

184
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:07,362
<i>They want to call me dangerous,
you haven't seen nothing yet.</i>

185
00:09:07,364 --> 00:09:09,364
<i>They want to
call me violent...</i>

186
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:12,701
You're trying... you're trying to
tell me I have to fight this guy?

187
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,069
Yeah.

188
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:16,871
<i>Buffalo Bad Boy, trust
me when I tell you...</i>

189
00:09:16,873 --> 00:09:19,140
This guy is amazing.

190
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,308
What? how is he amazing?

191
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,710
He's amazing.

192
00:09:21,712 --> 00:09:23,645
He's amazing.
He'll make you look great as well.

193
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,981
Look. He's bare
chested, he's committed.

194
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,316
This is going
to be a hard pass.

195
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,718
I'm not fighting him.

196
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,986
Well, I'll have to hard
sell it to you, then.

197
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,654
His pecs... are you
scared of his pecs?

198
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:33,722
Oh, definitely. Is that what this is?
Because he's topless?

199
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:35,223
Petrified.
You can be topless, too.

200
00:09:35,225 --> 00:09:36,591
I've seen it.

201
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:38,259
Look at it as more of
an exhibition match.

202
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:39,494
His fans are gonna tune in.

203
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,162
He's got these
crazy wrestling fans

204
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,231
who love watching him get hit
over the head with a steel chair.

205
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,933
He's not going to
have a steel chair.

206
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:46,501
He's gonna have no weapons.
He's gonna have to fight you.

207
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,902
And these so-called tough
guys are going get knocked

208
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:49,404
out easily, emphatic fashion.

209
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:50,505
I want a highlight
reel knockout.

210
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,107
Can you give me that?

211
00:09:52,109 --> 00:09:54,275
I want someone like Jake Carver.
Three-fight win streak.

212
00:09:54,277 --> 00:09:56,344
Yeah, look...
That's who I want.

213
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,179
Look how entertaining
this guy is.

214
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,015
Right?
Bare chest?

215
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,850
He's entertaining
as a comedian.

216
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,284
Looks like he just stepped out of
some sort of an '80s tribute band.

217
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:05,020
Look.

218
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,455
<i>...when I get that son of a
bitch inside a steel cage and I</i>

219
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:10,258
<i>get my fingernails
underneath his eyelids</i>

220
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,626
<i>and I pull on his flesh...</i>

221
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:13,862
Come on, you gotta
give this guy a shot.

222
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,463
Give this guy a shot.

223
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:17,032
He should be a comedian.
I'm not going to lie.

224
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,867
He is making me laugh.
He is a comedian.

225
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,435
Look, he's got a
massive fan base

226
00:10:20,437 --> 00:10:23,038
in the wrestling world, yeah?
They're going to come over.

227
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,639
They're going to give us those
pay-per-view numbers, man.

228
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:27,108
Okay?
Boss lady asked for this, yeah?

229
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,376
It's what Max wants.

230
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,878
Yeah, so when you
knock him out, like

231
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,713
I said, in devastating
fashion, you can have you

232
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,015
whatever you want after that.
Anything you say.

233
00:10:38,155 --> 00:10:40,155
You deserve this.

234
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:42,991
Ooh!
You deserve it.

235
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:44,559
All right.
Think about it, yeah?

236
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,561
Easy money?
Easy money.

237
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,463
Easy money, man.
Easy money. All right.

238
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,131
Can we toast to this?

239
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:51,666
We can toast to this. To you.
To knocking out Big Mouth.

240
00:10:51,668 --> 00:10:53,568
Give me the contract.
I'll give you the contract.

241
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,903
And let's clean out this clown.
Easy money.

242
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,505
This episode
of <i>The MMA Show</i>

243
00:10:57,507 --> 00:10:59,240
is brought to you by Lex.

244
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,976
Lex, providing capital
to fuel growth in energy,

245
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:04,579
tech, and real estate.

246
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:08,016
And right now we're joined in
studio by none other than Max

247
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:10,652
Black, promoter of Legends.

248
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:14,823
And apparently you have
a pretty big announcement

249
00:11:14,825 --> 00:11:16,324
for our listeners today, huh?

250
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:17,659
That's right, Stephen.

251
00:11:17,661 --> 00:11:21,262
We are putting together
the biggest fight

252
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,031
in the history of Legends.

253
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:24,766
All right, you ready for this?

254
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:26,101
Mm-hmm.
You sure?

255
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,503
Yeah.
All right, here we go.

256
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:32,273
Reiss Gibbons, five-time
light heavyweight champion,

257
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,110
will be fighting Randy Stone.

258
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:41,783
From pro wrestling?

259
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,885
That's right.

260
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:45,120
Max, come on.

261
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,788
I mean, no offense
to pro wrestling,

262
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,723
but you're not talking about
a real fight here, are you?

263
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:51,526
I mean, you're talking MMA
you're talking pro wrestling...

264
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:54,129
apples, oranges.
Stephen, come on, man.

265
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,363
Use your imagination.

266
00:11:55,365 --> 00:11:57,866
You put four-ounce
gloves on anyone,

267
00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:00,702
and in MMA, anything
could happen.

268
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:01,903
That's why people love it.

269
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:03,304
That's what's so
beautiful about it.

270
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:07,742
You can't possibly look
me in the eyes right now

271
00:12:07,744 --> 00:12:10,812
and tell me that you
believe that Randy

272
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,882
Stone has any chance,
has a chance in hell,

273
00:12:13,884 --> 00:12:15,817
of beating Reiss Gibbons.

274
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,051
He's got a shot.

275
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:18,486
How is it that
this guy just walks

276
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:22,824
in from pro wrestling
into MMA and off the bat

277
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:23,892
he gets a title shot?

278
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:25,927
It's unheard of.
It's absurd.

279
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:27,328
The purists are going
to go crazy here.

280
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,731
Honestly, I saw
this guy train.

281
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:32,333
I mean, he's knocking
out his sparring partners

282
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,002
left and right.

283
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,437
And did I mention,
Danny Thicket is training him right now.

284
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:38,840
He's a legend, of course.
Legendary trainer.

285
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,742
And he wouldn't be
wasting his time on anyone

286
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:42,010
unless he believed in him.

287
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,578
Randy Stone is also huge.

288
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,347
Big guy.
The guy is as strong as an ox.

289
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,083
Max, Max, are you just trying
to take a turd here, polish

290
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:50,351
it up, and call it a diamond?

291
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,686
Or... Come on.

292
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,921
I'm telling you, I
think this is going

293
00:12:52,923 --> 00:12:54,589
to be a really exciting fight.

294
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:55,757
There you have it.

295
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,859
So one month from today.

296
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,027
Yep.

297
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,595
Reiss Gibbons.
Yep.

298
00:13:00,597 --> 00:13:02,096
Randy Stone.
Yep.

299
00:13:02,098 --> 00:13:03,431
For the Light Heavyweight
Championship. Uh-huh.

300
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:04,966
And that's me.

301
00:13:04,968 --> 00:13:07,035
It's going to be a fight you're
never going to forget about.

302
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,269
I know, but you see
what I'm doing right now?

303
00:13:08,271 --> 00:13:09,971
You're tapping out.
I'm tapping out.

304
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:11,439
I'm tapping out.
I'm tapping out on <i>The MMA Show</i> for today.

305
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:12,507
That's all I got.

306
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,211
I can't believe it, man.

307
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,112
Believe it.

308
00:13:18,114 --> 00:13:19,948
Oh.

309
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,816
Man.

310
00:13:21,818 --> 00:13:24,219
Beautiful thing, man.

311
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:31,292
You did it. That's you up there,
your face, for everyone to see.

312
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,895
Everyone?
Walk past and see it.

313
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,463
Kids will see that.

314
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:37,232
They look up to you anyway
because you're tall.

315
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:39,133
Most people anyway.
Most people.

316
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:40,969
But now they
really see it, man.

317
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:42,403
Walking past this, remember?

318
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,905
I remember, man.

319
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,974
As a kid
a broke down billboard.

320
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:49,510
With the paper hanging up?
With the paper hanging up.

321
00:13:49,512 --> 00:13:50,979
Now look at us, man.

322
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:52,647
Yeah, man.

323
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:55,083
It's beautiful.

324
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,150
Yeah, man.

325
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,756
Man, are you crying?

326
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:02,924
Huh?

327
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,026
There might be a
slight tear, bro.

328
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:06,861
It might be a bit of glazing.

329
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:08,863
Oh, come here.
Come on.

330
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:10,665
Yeah, yeah. I'm crying.
It's okay, it's okay.

331
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:13,501
I can see a little something.

332
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:25,113
<i>The Legends cage
is reserved for the very</i>

333
00:14:25,115 --> 00:14:27,715
<i>best fighters on the planet.</i>

334
00:14:27,717 --> 00:14:31,686
<i>And Reiss Gibbons is
the best of the best.</i>

335
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:35,123
<i>The five-time champion
has faced all challenges</i>

336
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,958
<i>and cleared out his division.</i>

337
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,028
<i>Now, with all his endorsement
deals and new movie deals,</i>

338
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,430
<i>Reiss Gibbons is on
top of the world.</i>

339
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:50,138
<i>But it wasn't always
like this for Reiss.</i>

340
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,573
<i>Reiss comes from
humble beginnings.</i>

341
00:14:52,575 --> 00:14:54,809
<i>He is the oldest
of three children,</i>

342
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,145
<i>and his parents,
Amanda and Dante,</i>

343
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:01,215
<i>passed away when he
was just 15 years old.</i>

344
00:15:01,217 --> 00:15:03,151
<i>Reiss was left to
fend for himself.</i>

345
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,820
<i>When my parents passed
away, it was really tough.</i>

346
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:08,823
I felt lost, and...

347
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,825
you know, until I met Marcus.

348
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,094
<i>He kind of took
me under his wing.</i>

349
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:18,099
And, you know, he showed me
how to throw my first punch.

350
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:20,401
<i>I didn't know how
to express myself,</i>

351
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:24,105
<i>and he showed me how to put that and turn
it around and make it positive, you know.</i>

352
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:25,673
That's all right.
Let him work.

353
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:28,509
Let him work there.
Let him work.

354
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,912
Nice.
Nice.

355
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:33,247
Yeah, Marcus has taught
me, as a man and a fighter,

356
00:15:33,249 --> 00:15:38,186
to be humble in victory or
defeat, to look after your own.

357
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:40,855
<i>And that's exactly why my
family is so important.</i>

358
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,690
<i>That's exactly why strength
is so important to me,</i>

359
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,159
because I gotta look
after my people, you know.

360
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,864
<i>Do you know, people
recognizing you on the street,</i>

361
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,866
<i>it's a bit weird at the start.</i>

362
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,201
<i>But you kind of
get used to it.</i>

363
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,770
<i>And again, I don't
want to turn them down.</i>

364
00:15:55,772 --> 00:15:57,805
<i>I want to show them
that I do care.</i>

365
00:15:57,807 --> 00:16:00,208
If they want a picture,
it takes two seconds out of my day.

366
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,444
<i>Who am I to say no to that?</i>

367
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:06,381
<i>I love coming back
and coming to the gyms</i>

368
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:09,617
<i>and seeing their little
faces beam when I walk in.</i>

369
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:11,486
<i>Yeah, I do think I can
inspire them, for sure.</i>

370
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:14,889
<i>You know, seeing someone from
their own area coming up,</i>

371
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:18,059
<i>having a rough childhood,
losing people that they love,</i>

372
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,728
you know, and I still
am on the right track.

373
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,164
<i>I would love to
inspire all of them.</i>

374
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,734
If I didn't have fighting
to fall back on, who knows?

375
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:33,641
I would have been either in a
cell or in a box, six foot deep.

376
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:37,078
That's how most people
I know have ended up.

377
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,846
So it's not no joke.

378
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:41,416
It's serious.

379
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,151
<i>But his
sixth title defense</i>

380
00:16:43,153 --> 00:16:45,253
<i>presents a new challenge...</i>

381
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,221
<i>wrestling champion
Randy Stone.</i>

382
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:51,659
<i>Randy is one of
the best wrestlers</i>

383
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:53,261
<i>the world has ever seen.</i>

384
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:57,265
<i>And he's gonna shake up the
world of Mixed Martial Arts.</i>

385
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:01,936
I am on a pilgrimage to
scorch the earth of AEW one

386
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:07,108
broken neck at a time, until
I am the last man standing.

387
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,610
<i>Well, hands down,
Randy Stone is the most powerful fighter</i>

388
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,212
that I've ever worked with.

389
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:12,613
He's one of the strongest
human beings I've ever seen.

390
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,116
<i>For a world champion,
I don't think he's</i>

391
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,517
<i>ever been hit by
a guy like me.</i>

392
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,453
It's going to be like
getting hit by a truck.

393
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,521
<i>He thinks that's
some kind of joke.</i>

394
00:17:20,523 --> 00:17:22,023
<i>It ain't going to be funny.</i>

395
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:23,791
<i>Well, he knocks out
all his training partners.</i>

396
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,293
So I've been having
a hard time keeping

397
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,694
people in the ring with him.

398
00:17:26,696 --> 00:17:28,629
<i>He's so intense and he's
so powerful that he's</i>

399
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,064
<i>been knocking them out clean.</i>

400
00:17:30,066 --> 00:17:32,200
It's actually getting to
be a bit of a problem.

401
00:17:32,202 --> 00:17:33,701
<i>Randy's the
most divisive figure</i>

402
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:35,870
<i>to ever step foot
in the Legends cage,</i>

403
00:17:35,872 --> 00:17:38,973
<i>splitting the world of MMA and
professional wrestling right</i>

404
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,409
<i>down the middle.</i>

405
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:43,878
<i>I've been in
the ring with Randy Stone.</i>

406
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,880
<i>And I know this
is the MMA world.</i>

407
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:47,582
And I am sure
Gibbons thinks he's

408
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:49,750
going to have a night
off because wrestling

409
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,319
is fake, right?

410
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:53,087
But you can't fake toughness.

411
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:54,822
<i>And you can't fake strength.</i>

412
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,158
<i>And Randy Stone
has both of those.</i>

413
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,660
I think both Gibbons
and the MMA world

414
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,229
are going to be in for
a shock.

415
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:02,330
He truly is hardcore.

416
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:03,664
He is extreme.

417
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,433
<i>And everyone's talking
about this match.</i>

418
00:18:05,435 --> 00:18:07,935
When Reiss hits Randy Stone and
he realizes he can't hurt Randy

419
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:11,172
Stone, the life and soul
will get totally sucked

420
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:12,840
out of Reiss Gibbons.

421
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,076
I'm picking Randy all the way.

422
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:17,845
<i>Randy, as an
opponent, he's a clown.</i>

423
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:20,581
It's a joke.
That's why I keep laughing.

424
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,283
How can I keep a straight face
when we talk about this guy?

425
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:23,784
<i>I feel like I'm
going to walk through</i>

426
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:26,687
<i>him like I walk through
my Sunday dinners at home.</i>

427
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,523
I want to stick a fork
in him because he's done.

428
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,024
<i>We've seen this all before.</i>

429
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,759
<i>He's funny.</i>

430
00:18:31,761 --> 00:18:33,361
People want to come over to our
sport, especially from more

431
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:36,264
an acting sort of
background, fake wrestling.

432
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:37,532
<i>This is real life.</i>

433
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:38,866
<i>This is real sport.</i>

434
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,535
And I think you have
<i>more chance of seeing</i>

435
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:43,804
Elvis Presley crash a UFO on
top of the Loch Ness Monster

436
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:45,206
than him winning.

437
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,441
Randy Stone coming in
to fight Reiss Gibbons.

438
00:18:47,443 --> 00:18:48,643
What do I think?

439
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:50,144
Not much.

440
00:18:50,146 --> 00:18:51,546
I don't think it's going
to have anything to offer.

441
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,614
I think Reiss puts him
away in the first round.

442
00:18:53,616 --> 00:18:55,950
I find it incredibly
disrespectful when

443
00:18:55,952 --> 00:18:59,053
so-called experts
talk about how pro

444
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,622
<i>wrestlers aren't
real athletes.</i>

445
00:19:01,624 --> 00:19:05,726
I'm telling you, Randy Stone is
going to this guy up.

446
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:10,164
Randy Stone is not going
to beat Reiss Gibbons.

447
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,833
Reiss Gibbons is going to
beat him the first round

448
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:15,303
by knockout or submission.

449
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:17,738
I know Randy Stone
quite well, actually.

450
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,074
And he wouldn't be
doing anything that he

451
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,009
doesn't think he can win.

452
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:23,911
<i>And I know the performance
side is one thing,</i>

453
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:26,414
<i>but there's a lot of
overlap in the training.</i>

454
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,649
<i>And I think people are
going to be surprised.</i>

455
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:33,588
And watching Randy train, he's
got some heavy hands, man.

456
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,756
He's got some real
pop in those hands.

457
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:38,092
<i>I think he's going to
surprise a lot of critics.</i>

458
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,860
He's going to shut
a lot of mouths,

459
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:43,431
people that doubt professional
wrestlers in MMA fights.

460
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,366
<i>All eyes
will be on this fight.</i>

461
00:19:45,368 --> 00:19:47,101
<i>And one thing is for sure.</i>

462
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,504
<i>The world of professional wrestling
and the world of MMA will collide.</i>

463
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:58,946
And we're joined
by Randy Stone.

464
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:02,183
Randy, thanks for taking the
time to talk with us today.

465
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:03,718
Oh, you're welcome.

466
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,454
Now, many pro wrestlers
have attempted to cross over

467
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,556
into MMA and do what you're
about to do right now

468
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:10,558
and haven't quite found the...

469
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,961
to put it politely, the
success they were hoping for.

470
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,229
What makes you any different?

471
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,731
I don't think about it.

472
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:18,699
I didn't come here to talk
about some other losers.

473
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:20,801
I didn't come here to talk
about somebody else's failures.

474
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,571
I didn't come here to
talk about the past.

475
00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:25,072
<i>I came here to talk
about the future,</i>

476
00:20:25,074 --> 00:20:27,642
<i>and the future is, I'm
gonna knock Reiss Gibbons'</i>

477
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,143
<i>head off of his shoulders.</i>

478
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,645
<i>These are bricks.</i>

479
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,647
<i>These are Mack trucks.</i>

480
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,982
<i>I'm gonna knock him out.</i>

481
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,484
<i>I've been telling
everybody for weeks.</i>

482
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,252
<i>I'm telling the whole world.
I'm gonna knock him out.</i>

483
00:20:38,254 --> 00:20:39,987
<i>And you all think it's a joke.</i>

484
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,322
You're talking to me...

485
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,990
I'm here on this bush
league level show.

486
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,558
Randy, we can appreciate that
you have your game face on

487
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,495
and you're in the zone,
but we're the biggest

488
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,163
MMA show in the world, so...

489
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,499
Everybody thinks this is going
to be some big embarrassment.

490
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,434
Everybody thinks I'm going to
go out there and get my pants

491
00:20:53,436 --> 00:20:55,503
pulled down and show the crack
of my ass in front of the whole

492
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:56,837
world, like I'm gonna...

493
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,340
I'm gonna be the one
that's embarrassed.

494
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,108
There's a lot of gum chewing
going on there as well.

495
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,777
You know, people do that
when they're nervous.

496
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:04,679
<i>There's a reason I'm the
biggest superstar in the world.</i>

497
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:07,682
<i>There's a reason he needs
me to sell a pay-per-view.</i>

498
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:08,949
<i>That's the irony.</i>

499
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:10,584
Well, you're not
lacking confidence.

500
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:13,521
But let me ask you, this is
your first pro MMA fight,

501
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:16,524
your first training camp.

502
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:17,858
<i>And how's that going for you?</i>

503
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,093
It's going, dude.

504
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:20,528
I'm in the best
shape of my life.

505
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,096
<i>I'm stronger than him.</i>

506
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:23,864
<i>I'm bigger than him.</i>

507
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,199
<i>I'm faster than him.</i>

508
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,368
<i>I'm tougher than him.
I'm smarter than him.</i>

509
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,769
<i>I'm better looking than him.</i>

510
00:21:28,771 --> 00:21:30,371
<i>I have no respect for him.</i>

511
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,039
But you have to realize
that the pundits, the experts,

512
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,642
have Reiss as a 10-to-1
favorite to retain

513
00:21:34,644 --> 00:21:35,876
his title against you.

514
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,479
And if you're
keeping score, those

515
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:41,048
are the worst odds for
any challenger competing

516
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,883
inside of a Legends cage.

517
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,452
How are you feeling?

518
00:21:44,454 --> 00:21:48,222
Odds makers, betting
lines, people playing games.

519
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,959
No, this ain't...
This ain't a game, dude.

520
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:54,662
This is absurd.
Where's he going?

521
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:56,964
This isn't scripted like the
other place you came from.

522
00:21:56,966 --> 00:21:58,299
Come on.

523
00:21:58,301 --> 00:21:59,900
<i>I don't know what he
was expecting here.</i>

524
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,669
I mean, we ask the tough questions
on <i>The Stephen Drake Show.</i>

525
00:22:01,671 --> 00:22:03,904
We're going to take a little break.
We're going to pay the bills.

526
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,673
We're going to come
back, and we're

527
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:07,541
going to talk to the Nightmare,
the hottest free agent in MMA.

528
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,589
He should be here
in a minute anyway.

529
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,858
Oh, there he is.

530
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,160
Look,
he brought his cheerleaders.

531
00:22:26,162 --> 00:22:27,661
He's a lot bigger in person.

532
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:30,097
He ain't that big.
Should we go say hello?

533
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,599
Sure, come on.

534
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,770
Yo, Randy, I thought
I'd introduce myself.

535
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,104
I'm Reiss.

536
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,773
I'm not going to
shake your fucking hand.

537
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:41,175
What?
After all that shit you talked?

538
00:22:41,177 --> 00:22:42,710
Man, that's just promotion.

539
00:22:42,712 --> 00:22:44,545
I thought you of all people
would understand that.

540
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:45,846
Yeah.

541
00:22:45,848 --> 00:22:48,282
You don't know shit
about promotion.

542
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,618
You don't think I belong
in a cage with you?

543
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,953
I don't. But let's
keep it professional.

544
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,388
I'm going to make
you a lot of money.

545
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,790
Oh, no, no, no.

546
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:56,957
Let's get this straight.

547
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,125
I don't need you.

548
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,393
You need me.

549
00:22:59,395 --> 00:23:01,362
I'm going to make
you a lot of money.

550
00:23:01,364 --> 00:23:03,130
You should show some respect.

551
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:09,703
Save it for the fight.

552
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:13,974
I want Randy.

553
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,976
<i>All right.
Welcome, everyone.</i>

554
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,646
Welcome to "Legends:
Worlds Collide."

555
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:22,416
Man, we are so excited
about this fight.

556
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:25,386
When my father died and I
took over Legends, many of you

557
00:23:25,388 --> 00:23:26,887
people in this very room...

558
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:29,256
I know who you are,
I don't forget...

559
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:31,659
thought I was going to run
Legends into the ground.

560
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:37,665
And now here we are, on the
cusp of the biggest fight

561
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,099
in our history.

562
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:42,503
And we are trending
at this moment,

563
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,606
looking around, over 2
million buys on pay-per-view.

564
00:23:45,608 --> 00:23:48,509
So definitely at
the right place.

565
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,277
All right.

566
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:52,680
So why don't we open it up to
questions, let these guys talk.

567
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:57,618
Randy, what's your mental state right now?
Are you excited?

568
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,853
Are you feeling confident?

569
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:00,688
Brother, there
ain't a word for what

570
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,523
my mental state is right now.

571
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,625
Confidence is not the word.

572
00:24:04,627 --> 00:24:07,528
Complete self-assurance.

573
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,598
Like I know the sun's going
to come up tomorrow morning,

574
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,133
I know I'm going to take
this man's head off.

575
00:24:13,135 --> 00:24:14,602
I'm feeling homicidal.

576
00:24:14,604 --> 00:24:16,203
Reiss is feeling suicidal.

577
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,771
I'm going to kill this man.

578
00:24:17,773 --> 00:24:19,807
Man, you've got to stop acting, Randy.
You know that, right?

579
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:21,208
This is real.

580
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,110
When we step in there...
When we step in there,

581
00:24:23,112 --> 00:24:25,279
I ain't gonna throw you through no
table, jump off a turnbuckle, huh?

582
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:27,715
Yeah, it's gonna be real.
This is real. Yeah, it's real.

583
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,450
It's going to be real.
You laugh. It's real.

584
00:24:29,452 --> 00:24:31,986
You think it's a joke.
You're all laughing.

585
00:24:31,988 --> 00:24:34,288
You, with your stupid little
vlog, you think I'm a joke.

586
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:36,991
Nobody listens to your stupid
fucking podcast, by the way.

587
00:24:36,993 --> 00:24:38,559
Everybody thinks
this is some kind

588
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:42,396
of Max Black big
publicity stunt, put Randy

589
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:44,164
Stone in a cage,
real big joke.

590
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:46,066
It's not going to be
funny when they're pulling

591
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,068
Reiss's teeth out of
the back of his ass

592
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,637
when I knock his head off.

593
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:50,905
All right, all right.

594
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,506
How about we have
another question?

595
00:24:52,508 --> 00:24:53,807
Reiss, Reiss!

596
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,810
Hey, Reiss...
Have you looked

597
00:24:56,812 --> 00:24:59,246
at any of the wrestling greats
for, you know, a new gimmick?

598
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:02,516
Someone like Roddy Piper
or Macho Man Randy Savage.

599
00:25:02,518 --> 00:25:03,984
Hey, fuck you over
there, all right?

600
00:25:03,986 --> 00:25:06,086
This isn't a joke.

601
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,489
I'm going to beat this man
within an inch of his life.

602
00:25:08,491 --> 00:25:11,325
I'm going to walk away with
that championship belt.

603
00:25:11,327 --> 00:25:13,027
I'm the toughest
man in the world.

604
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:16,096
I'm the biggest name in combat sports.
I'm going to prove that.

605
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,598
Let's see.

606
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,766
Let's see when you're
standing in front of 20,000

607
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,334
strong Londoners, yeah?

608
00:25:20,336 --> 00:25:22,102
Let's see.

609
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,370
You're going to be quaking in
your little leather boots, man.

610
00:25:23,372 --> 00:25:24,772
You're going to
get lobotomized.

611
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:26,340
You're not going to be
able to form sentences

612
00:25:26,342 --> 00:25:28,108
after I knock you out.

613
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,710
I just hope you'll be able to get
your dick hard after the fight.

614
00:25:29,712 --> 00:25:31,545
All right, all
right, guys, hey?

615
00:25:31,547 --> 00:25:33,547
If not, honey, you
know where to find me.

616
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:35,282
I'll be in the biggest
suite in London.

617
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:37,952
I won't even make you
sleep on the couch.

618
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,292
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

619
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,797
<i>And here we
are at last, the fight</i>

620
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,799
<i>the world has been
waiting for.</i>

621
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:55,069
<i>Reiss Gibbons versus Randy
Stone, Worlds Collide.</i>

622
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:56,570
<i>These guys
have been trash</i>

623
00:25:56,572 --> 00:25:59,039
<i>talking each other for weeks.</i>

624
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:01,976
<i>There's real bad blood
between these two fighters.</i>

625
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:05,079
<i>The live gate
sold out within an hour.</i>

626
00:26:05,081 --> 00:26:06,647
<i>If we look at the
tale of the tape,</i>

627
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:09,249
<i>the big thing that jumps
out are their records.</i>

628
00:26:09,251 --> 00:26:12,886
<i>Reiss Gibbons, undefeated with
a perfect record of 19 and 0,</i>

629
00:26:12,888 --> 00:26:16,056
<i>versus Randy Stone's 0 and 0.</i>

630
00:26:16,058 --> 00:26:19,326
<i>This is Randy Stone's
first ever professional fight.</i>

631
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,162
<i>This has gotten big fight
bill written all over it.</i>

632
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:25,165
<i>You are
absolutely right, Jimmy.</i>

633
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,568
Knee.

634
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,503
Knee.

635
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,672
Hook.

636
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:34,174
Hook right hand.
Hook right hand.

637
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,110
Knee.
Come on.

638
00:26:36,112 --> 00:26:38,412
Knee.

639
00:26:38,414 --> 00:26:39,913
Yeah, looking good, huh?

640
00:26:39,915 --> 00:26:41,782
How are you? How's it going?
Good, good, good.

641
00:26:41,784 --> 00:26:42,950
Yeah, you feel good?

642
00:26:42,952 --> 00:26:44,251
I feel good.

643
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:46,120
I'm gonna whoop this clown's
ass, Max. Yeah?

644
00:26:46,122 --> 00:26:47,855
You ready to kill him?
Committed to kill him.

645
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:49,089
Just do me a favor.

646
00:26:49,091 --> 00:26:50,190
Try not to make it
too quick so I can

647
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:51,458
squeeze in a couple of spots.

648
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,693
I'll try, I'll try.

649
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:53,861
But I know, easy
money for me, right?

650
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,462
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just take it easy.

651
00:26:55,464 --> 00:26:57,431
Have a good time.
You need anything?

652
00:26:57,433 --> 00:26:59,433
Bottle of champagne for my win.
All right.

653
00:26:59,435 --> 00:27:00,934
Afterward it'll be waiting for you.
Dom Perignon, yeah?

654
00:27:00,936 --> 00:27:03,103
All right. You got it, man.
All right.

655
00:27:03,105 --> 00:27:05,205
All right.
Have a good time. 2, 3.

656
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,441
2, 3.

657
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:10,444
<i>The internet has
literally been exploding</i>

658
00:27:10,446 --> 00:27:11,979
<i>in the build-up to this fight.</i>

659
00:27:11,981 --> 00:27:14,381
<i>I don't think I've ever seen
this level of hostility.</i>

660
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,983
<i>Absolutely, Bobby.</i>

661
00:27:15,985 --> 00:27:18,652
<i>And there are so many question
marks surrounding Stone.</i>

662
00:27:18,654 --> 00:27:20,487
<i>While Randy is
known as a wrestler,</i>

663
00:27:20,489 --> 00:27:22,289
<i>a little known
fact is he actually</i>

664
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:24,625
<i>started out boxing
as a teenager when he</i>

665
00:27:24,627 --> 00:27:26,326
<i>was growing up in Cincinnati.</i>

666
00:27:26,328 --> 00:27:28,829
<i>He has described those years
as some of the most rewarding,</i>

667
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:31,565
<i>and that is the itch that
got him into the cage.</i>

668
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:37,071
You got this.

669
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,437
Okay, gentlemen.

670
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,940
We already went over the
rules in the locker room.

671
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,942
Any questions from
the challenger?

672
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:16,510
Any questions from
the champion?

673
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,012
Okay, you can touch
gloves if you want.

674
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:21,782
<i>And there's the
theatrics from pro wrestling.</i>

675
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:24,251
<i>I guess Randy
Stone doesn't touch hands.</i>

676
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,791
Fight.

677
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:33,293
<i>Randy Stone comes
out with a flying knee.</i>

678
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,129
<i>He's not wasting
any time in there.</i>

679
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:36,797
<i>Randy's throwing
hooks with bad intentions,</i>

680
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,800
<i>but he's lacking a lot of
finesse in his technique.</i>

681
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:41,034
<i>He's really sloppy in there.</i>

682
00:28:41,036 --> 00:28:42,803
<i>He's just
hurling his punches.</i>

683
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,139
<i>I would like to see
Reiss keep his hands up, though.</i>

684
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:46,540
Get in there, Randy.

685
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:48,475
Take this serious. Come on.
Keep your hands up.

686
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,644
Quit showboating.
Let's go.

687
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:55,916
<i>He really does look
like an amateur in there</i>

688
00:28:55,918 --> 00:28:57,151
<i>with a professional.</i>

689
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:59,253
<i>Reiss is so smooth
with his striking,</i>

690
00:28:59,255 --> 00:29:02,823
<i>so technical, whereas Randy
telegraphs his punches.</i>

691
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:04,825
<i>This looks like
it's going to get ugly real</i>

692
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:06,560
<i>quick for Randy Stone.</i>

693
00:29:06,562 --> 00:29:09,329
<i>At least he's starting to do some
real damage against the cage.</i>

694
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,665
<i>He's turning it up.</i>

695
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:12,933
<i>Yes, he is, Bobby.</i>

696
00:29:12,935 --> 00:29:14,568
<i>Reiss picking him
apart, and he's just</i>

697
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:18,238
<i>landed a spinning back kick.</i>

698
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,608
<i>Reiss tosses Randy Stone to
the ground like a rag doll.</i>

699
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,844
<i>Well, Randy
rushes in like a bull.</i>

700
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,746
<i>He presses Reiss up
against the cage.</i>

701
00:29:25,748 --> 00:29:29,616
<i>Reiss is just so
hard to take down, though.</i>

702
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:32,252
He's grabbing the fence!

703
00:29:32,254 --> 00:29:34,121
<i>Randy's
grabbing the fence.</i>

704
00:29:34,123 --> 00:29:36,523
<i>There's no five second
rule like in pro wrestling.</i>

705
00:29:39,962 --> 00:29:41,762
Off the cage.
Circle out.

706
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,968
<i>Randy's doing a really
good job of applying pressure.</i>

707
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:53,106
<i>I'm surprised Reiss hasn't
managed to escape by now.</i>

708
00:29:53,108 --> 00:29:54,775
<i>And Randy Stone
has landed a takedown.</i>

709
00:29:54,777 --> 00:29:57,377
<i>That is only the second
time in Reiss's career</i>

710
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,645
<i>he has been taken down.</i>

711
00:29:58,647 --> 00:30:00,047
<i>I'm stunned, Bobby.</i>

712
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:02,783
<i>Taking down Reiss
Gibbons is no small feat.</i>

713
00:30:02,785 --> 00:30:04,284
<i>This is
signature Danny Thicket,</i>

714
00:30:04,286 --> 00:30:06,553
<i>working up against the
cage, dirty boxing,</i>

715
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:08,121
<i>making it a dogfight.</i>

716
00:30:08,123 --> 00:30:11,058
<i>And Randy's landed
a second takedown.</i>

717
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,328
<i>I'm really surprised at how much Reiss
is struggling with Randy's size and power.</i>

718
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,896
Back it.
Back up.

719
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:17,331
Stay on him.

720
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:19,299
No mercy.

721
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:21,335
Come on, move!

722
00:30:21,337 --> 00:30:24,338
<i>Well, this is what Danny
Thicket has been talking about.</i>

723
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,140
<i>There's one thing you can't
fake, and that's strength.</i>

724
00:30:27,142 --> 00:30:29,076
<i>And Randy's just hit
a slick judo throw.</i>

725
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:31,578
Get off the bottom.
Work your way up.

726
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,247
Get out of there.

727
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:35,015
<i>Reiss is back
up, and he's just</i>

728
00:30:35,017 --> 00:30:37,751
<i>landed a nice elbow,
opening up a cut in Randy Stone's head.</i>

729
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:41,255
Combinations, just
like we practiced.

730
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:43,090
<i>Randy hits
another takedown.</i>

731
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,758
<i>That's the fourth of
this fight.</i>

732
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,426
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

733
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,262
<i>And now he's mounted Reiss.</i>

734
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:50,664
<i>Reiss is launching haymakers.</i>

735
00:30:50,666 --> 00:30:52,599
<i>Randy is
clearly demonstrating</i>

736
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,101
<i>his strength advantage.</i>

737
00:30:54,103 --> 00:30:57,104
<i>Reiss is really struggling.</i>

738
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:58,605
Nice.
Nice work.

739
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,007
Go to work.
Let's work.

740
00:31:04,513 --> 00:31:05,946
<i>Reiss is on
shaky legs out there.</i>

741
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,781
<i>He really looks
unsure of himself.</i>

742
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,850
Come on, Reiss.
Keep your hands up.

743
00:31:09,852 --> 00:31:11,952
Come on, do some hand fighting.
Do some hand fighting, Randy.

744
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:13,220
<i>Reiss lands a nice jab.</i>

745
00:31:13,222 --> 00:31:15,856
Combinations, just
like we practiced.

746
00:31:15,858 --> 00:31:17,557
<i>Another.</i>

747
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,793
<i>Reiss looks like he's
getting back into his groove.</i>

748
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,229
<i>He's creating some distance.</i>

749
00:31:22,231 --> 00:31:24,197
<i>He's got to keep Stone
away from him, though.</i>

750
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,599
<i>He needs to keep
those hands up.</i>

751
00:31:29,905 --> 00:31:31,038
<i>Randy lands a hook.</i>

752
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,974
Finish him.

753
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:36,243
Yeah!

754
00:31:36,245 --> 00:31:37,878
- <i>Reiss is out!</i>
- Oh, my God.

755
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,047
<i>I can't believe it.
Reiss is knocked out.</i>

756
00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:41,982
<i>He is out.</i>

757
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:57,998
That's one of the
most dynamic punches

758
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,599
I've ever seen in this cage.

759
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:01,001
Oh, my God.

760
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,836
<i>He's wrestling down
the referee right now.</i>

761
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,172
<i>Reiss doesn't even
know where he is.</i>

762
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:09,242
<i>TJ Steele is talking to Reiss,
and Reiss is still coming to.</i>

763
00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:11,745
It's over.
You're knocked out.

764
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:20,420
<i>What started out as a
joke has turned into a travesty</i>

765
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:22,856
<i>for Reiss Gibbons
and his team.</i>

766
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,624
<i>This is the
most shocking night</i>

767
00:32:24,626 --> 00:32:27,194
<i>in the history of Legends,
perhaps in the history</i>

768
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:28,962
<i>of Mixed Martial Arts.</i>

769
00:32:28,964 --> 00:32:31,264
<i>I don't think a single person
in this arena saw this coming.</i>

770
00:32:35,771 --> 00:32:37,204
I told you all!

771
00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:53,053
<i>And look at him...
Shouting to the crowd.</i>

772
00:32:53,055 --> 00:32:55,555
<i>The antics... He's loving it.</i>

773
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:59,993
<i>Randy Stone is loving it.</i>

774
00:32:59,995 --> 00:33:01,995
<i>Welcome to
the Randy Stone era.</i>

775
00:33:01,997 --> 00:33:03,130
<i>Wow!</i>

776
00:33:06,969 --> 00:33:11,304
Ladies and gentlemen, winning
the fight in the first round

777
00:33:11,306 --> 00:33:16,576
by knockout, and new Light
Heavyweight Legends Champion

778
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:22,015
of the World, Randy Stone!

779
00:33:34,363 --> 00:33:37,330
I told you!
I told all you.

780
00:33:37,332 --> 00:33:39,332
You thought I was a joke.

781
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:40,867
Who's the joke now?

782
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:43,503
Reiss Gibbons is a joke.

783
00:33:43,505 --> 00:33:45,772
I'm the champion
of the world now.

784
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,441
Who's laughing now?

785
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:49,376
Laugh it up!

786
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:54,347
We're gonna party in London
tonight, you motherfuckers.

787
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:55,809
It's 3:00 in the morning.

788
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:04,184
I've been turned into a meme.

789
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:14,461
"When your mom says quit
crying before she gives

790
00:35:14,463 --> 00:35:16,096
"you something to cry about."

791
00:35:20,469 --> 00:35:23,770
"When you lose your mom
in the grocery store."

792
00:35:36,952 --> 00:35:38,785
People suck.

793
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,958
Come back to bed.

794
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:48,795
I'm good, baby.

795
00:36:23,832 --> 00:36:27,033
Reiss,
thanks for coming on the show tonight.

796
00:36:27,035 --> 00:36:29,269
How are you feeling?

797
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:30,770
Well, losing is no fun.

798
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,439
Yeah, I can imagine.

799
00:36:32,441 --> 00:36:33,840
The doctors, what do they say?

800
00:36:33,842 --> 00:36:35,108
What kind of time frame
are you looking at here?

801
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,376
When are you getting
back in the cage?

802
00:36:36,378 --> 00:36:39,713
Well, I wasn't
knocked out, so anytime.

803
00:36:39,715 --> 00:36:42,115
You...
You kind of were, Reiss.

804
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,450
I took no damage.

805
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:45,785
I can get back in there
as soon as possible.

806
00:36:45,787 --> 00:36:47,187
Look, I respect you.

807
00:36:47,189 --> 00:36:48,955
The whole MMA
community respects you.

808
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,625
But there were some questions
about your cage etiquette.

809
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,360
They're saying you didn't
take this fight seriously,

810
00:36:53,362 --> 00:36:55,061
and you didn't take
Randy Stone seriously.

811
00:36:55,063 --> 00:36:56,229
And you paid for it.

812
00:36:56,231 --> 00:36:57,731
Take it easy,
Steve, all right?

813
00:36:57,733 --> 00:37:03,036
Look, if I was showboating
and I got the knockout,

814
00:37:03,038 --> 00:37:05,872
no one would be talking,
right?

815
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:10,477
But I was having fun in there,
I got clipped, that's that.

816
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,545
Lucky shot.

817
00:37:12,547 --> 00:37:15,081
Is this the biggest upset
in the history of MMA?

818
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:18,151
Well, that's for you to
decide, Steve, all right?

819
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:19,653
Well, do you get
the immediate rematch?

820
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:21,154
Do you want the
immediate rematch?

821
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,822
Well, yeah.

822
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:25,425
You know, I've held the belt
longer than anyone, you know.

823
00:37:25,427 --> 00:37:31,398
But... That's
after this tiny little movie

824
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,166
from Jake Thorn.

825
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:34,668
Reiss, are you...

826
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,603
Are you not on social media?

827
00:37:36,605 --> 00:37:38,672
Yeah, I just
turned my phone off.

828
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,340
I'm not trying
to pile on here.

829
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:43,743
One of your castmates tweeted
out about a half hour ago...

830
00:37:43,745 --> 00:37:45,612
And I don't mean to be the
bearer of bad news here,

831
00:37:45,614 --> 00:37:48,515
but apparently
you've been replaced.

832
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,283
They recast the role.

833
00:37:50,285 --> 00:37:52,185
What?

834
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,687
It's on Twitter.

835
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:55,488
You should turn your phone on.

836
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,793
Prostitutes we
can pay off, yeah?

837
00:37:59,795 --> 00:38:01,194
Women claiming that
you've got kids

838
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:02,595
through them that
you're not paying for,

839
00:38:02,597 --> 00:38:03,930
we can pay them off, too.

840
00:38:03,932 --> 00:38:06,266
But you get busted for
steroids, injecting

841
00:38:06,268 --> 00:38:08,768
needles into your left
butt cheek five times...

842
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:09,936
And you tell me
it's an accident.

843
00:38:09,938 --> 00:38:11,705
Is it an accident?

844
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:13,640
What was you doing? Was you in
Vegas again with the snow bunnies?

845
00:38:13,642 --> 00:38:14,874
Yeah?

846
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,776
Sniffing cocaine
off their fake tits

847
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:19,045
and playing darts with them, and the
darts happened to contain steroids?

848
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,213
And then you happened to land
on them accidentally five times?

849
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,715
You're right.
Picograms, man.

850
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:22,882
It's a real thing.

851
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:24,050
It's a real thing,
and it happens.

852
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,885
Yeah?

853
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:27,721
Now, what you're going to do, you're
going to go home and see your family.

854
00:38:27,723 --> 00:38:29,723
By the way, your wife's been calling
me every single morning, yeah?

855
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,491
Why doesn't she call you?

856
00:38:31,493 --> 00:38:32,826
Do you know why she can't call you?
'Cause your phone's always off.

857
00:38:32,828 --> 00:38:34,160
Why is it always off?

858
00:38:34,162 --> 00:38:35,495
You got a 10-bedroom
mansion back there.

859
00:38:35,497 --> 00:38:36,896
You can afford a charger.

860
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,331
So what you're gonna do,
you're gonna go home,

861
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:39,499
and you're gonna get a
phone call from me, yeah?

862
00:38:39,501 --> 00:38:41,501
And when you get
that phone call,

863
00:38:41,503 --> 00:38:43,136
it's going to be me talking about the
press conference. Yeah? Stephen Drake.

864
00:38:43,138 --> 00:38:44,304
He's going to get
the exclusive.

865
00:38:44,306 --> 00:38:45,739
You're gonna talk
about your life.

866
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:47,240
You're gonna talk about
the fact that fighting

867
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:48,408
is the only thing that's
kept you sane, all right?

868
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,009
And that's going
to secure things.

869
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:51,745
You're gonna have to deal
with a two-year suspension.

870
00:38:51,747 --> 00:38:52,912
When you come back,
you're gonna come back stronger than ever.

871
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,414
Yeah, look at me...
Stronger than ever.

872
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:55,749
You're going to be
the champion.

873
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:57,016
Have another kid in
the meantime, yeah?

874
00:38:57,018 --> 00:38:59,352
And don't drive home yourself, yeah?
Get a cab.

875
00:38:59,354 --> 00:39:01,321
We don't need you running over
any pregnant women again, yeah?

876
00:39:01,323 --> 00:39:02,589
That was a difficult situation to solve,
wasn't it, yeah? All right. Wicked.

877
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:04,657
Come on.
You got this, yeah?

878
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:06,993
Stay out of trouble till then, yeah?
Thank you, Carlos.

879
00:39:06,995 --> 00:39:10,930
And Carlos, please don't
end up in Dubai again, yeah?

880
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:16,770
All right.

881
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:18,772
Magic man.

882
00:39:21,843 --> 00:39:23,009
I deserve this.

883
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:32,185
Yo, I'm cut from
Jake Thorn's movie.

884
00:39:32,187 --> 00:39:33,787
I just found out.

885
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:36,790
How does Stephen fucking
Drake find out before I do?

886
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:38,291
And you're supposed to
be the first to know.

887
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:39,726
Reiss, I was going
to call you as soon as.

888
00:39:39,728 --> 00:39:42,028
So what happened?

889
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,530
That role was about
you being the strongest

890
00:39:43,532 --> 00:39:45,298
soldier in the whole world.

891
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,568
It just doesn't work if
you're not the champ.

892
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,903
That was only my first loss.

893
00:39:49,905 --> 00:39:52,372
I know.
I know, Reiss.

894
00:39:55,243 --> 00:39:56,810
It's not the fact
that you lost.

895
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:59,145
It's the way you lost.

896
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:02,315
The crying thing,
the wrestling the ref to the canvas.

897
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:03,583
The media just got hold of it.

898
00:40:03,585 --> 00:40:04,918
And you know
better than anyone.

899
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,753
You're only as good
as your last fight.

900
00:40:06,755 --> 00:40:08,755
People have got a real
short-term memory these days.

901
00:40:08,757 --> 00:40:10,323
Then get me the rematch.

902
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,225
It's too soon.
We need to run it back.

903
00:40:12,227 --> 00:40:13,993
Get me the rematch, Reggie.

904
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:17,564
Are you sure?
Get me the rematch now.

905
00:40:17,566 --> 00:40:19,098
Laila Ali
has a plus one.

906
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,667
Yeah, definitely.
Front row.

907
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:22,602
Great.

908
00:40:22,604 --> 00:40:25,004
Idris Elba wants 10.

909
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:26,906
10?
10 comps?

910
00:40:26,908 --> 00:40:29,108
Guy's lucky he's so hot.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.

911
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,677
Front row?
That's great.

912
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,412
Peter Andre?

913
00:40:32,414 --> 00:40:33,913
No.
No, no, no.

914
00:40:33,915 --> 00:40:35,615
- Hard no.
- Hey, Max.

915
00:40:35,617 --> 00:40:37,250
Reggie!
You got a minute?

916
00:40:37,252 --> 00:40:39,185
Of course.
For you, I got a minute and a half.

917
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,620
- Lovely.
- Yeah.

918
00:40:40,622 --> 00:40:42,088
You look great, too.
Look at you.

919
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,590
Hi, Fred.
What's poppin', Reg?

920
00:40:43,592 --> 00:40:44,757
Not bad.
Not bad.

921
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:47,126
All good. Right.
You're in a good mood.

922
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:48,761
Yeah, are you kidding me?

923
00:40:48,763 --> 00:40:50,530
I got sponsors coming out
of my ears, my eyes, my ass.

924
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,966
It's great.

925
00:40:52,968 --> 00:40:54,534
Congratulations.
Thank you.

926
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:57,704
Hey, team effort, man.

927
00:40:57,706 --> 00:40:59,038
So we getting that rematch?

928
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,306
Yeah, of course you are.

929
00:41:00,308 --> 00:41:01,708
We can't wait to
agree to that bout.

930
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,209
Now, Reiss is
ready to sign ASAP.

931
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,711
He wants to redeem himself
and prove to the world

932
00:41:04,713 --> 00:41:07,146
that it was just a fluke.

933
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:08,214
Yeah.

934
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:11,284
Well, yeah.
I mean, he'll get it.

935
00:41:11,286 --> 00:41:12,952
You know.

936
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:17,557
But?

937
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,058
The truth is this.

938
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,895
Stone had a hard time
making the cut at 205.

939
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:23,563
So he's moving up
to heavyweight,

940
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:25,632
and he's going to
challenge Ferguson.

941
00:41:25,634 --> 00:41:26,900
Right?

942
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:28,401
I mean, the whole
champ-champ thing...

943
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:29,802
You know, you can't blame him.

944
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:31,905
Everyone wants to
do that right now.

945
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:35,341
But I want Reiss
to fight Nightmare.

946
00:41:35,343 --> 00:41:36,976
Nightmare?
Yeah.

947
00:41:36,978 --> 00:41:39,312
We just signed him.
But Max, we want Randy Stone.

948
00:41:39,314 --> 00:41:41,314
Yeah, but I'm not
offering you Stone.

949
00:41:48,823 --> 00:41:50,423
Max, we've always
stepped out for you, right?

950
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,325
Mm-hmm.

951
00:41:52,327 --> 00:41:54,093
You've needed us to fight on
three weeks' notice. We've done it.

952
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,662
Two weeks' notice.
We've done it.

953
00:41:55,664 --> 00:41:57,096
Yep. You guys are the best.
Up in weight, we've done it.

954
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:58,264
Down in
weight, we've done it.

955
00:41:58,266 --> 00:41:59,766
Yep.
Right?

956
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:01,534
- Reiss has always been a company man.
- Yep.

957
00:42:01,536 --> 00:42:03,202
- Held onto the strap for
nearly five years. - Yes.

958
00:42:03,204 --> 00:42:04,504
He deserves a rematch.

959
00:42:04,506 --> 00:42:07,273
Reggie, you and I
both know the money

960
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,676
fight is Stone-Ferguson.

961
00:42:09,678 --> 00:42:11,177
The money fight...

962
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:12,679
But this is about the
right fight, though, Max.

963
00:42:12,681 --> 00:42:13,947
Right fight?

964
00:42:13,949 --> 00:42:15,715
What is this, Mr.
Rogers' playhouse?

965
00:42:15,717 --> 00:42:17,216
What are we in
kindergarten, Reggie?

966
00:42:17,218 --> 00:42:19,218
Grow the fuck up.

967
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,386
Okay.

968
00:42:20,388 --> 00:42:23,122
So what if we lose?

969
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:24,390
Wow.

970
00:42:24,392 --> 00:42:25,792
You got that much
faith in him, huh?

971
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:27,961
Max, it's not about faith.

972
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:29,195
I'm being realistic.

973
00:42:29,197 --> 00:42:31,364
Look, Nightmare is
a dangerous fight.

974
00:42:31,366 --> 00:42:33,032
If we lose that fight,
that's two losses in a row.

975
00:42:33,034 --> 00:42:34,634
You know that.

976
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:36,869
It's a bad fight for us.

977
00:42:36,871 --> 00:42:38,571
Look, if Randy Stone is
too heavy for the division,

978
00:42:38,573 --> 00:42:40,573
then strip him.
I'm not gonna strip him.

979
00:42:40,575 --> 00:42:42,408
Create an interim title, then.

980
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:43,910
I'm not going to do that.

981
00:42:43,912 --> 00:42:45,478
Max, who's running this
fucking company, you know?

982
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,147
You or Randy Stone?
Where are your fucking balls at?

983
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,749
I've done a pretty
good job without balls,

984
00:42:49,751 --> 00:42:51,050
wouldn't you say, Reggie?
I don't know.

985
00:42:51,052 --> 00:42:52,385
I think that the
Max Black I know

986
00:42:52,387 --> 00:42:53,720
would have told him
to go fuck himself.

987
00:42:53,722 --> 00:42:55,388
Yeah.

988
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,756
Well, you're lucky the Max
Black is in a good mood today,

989
00:42:56,758 --> 00:42:59,058
or else I might tell
you to go fuck yourself.

990
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:02,495
Listen, man, we go
way back, right?

991
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,430
I know you're just
trying to do your job.

992
00:43:04,432 --> 00:43:06,232
Well, give me a fucking break.

993
00:43:06,234 --> 00:43:07,600
That's what I'm
trying to do here.

994
00:43:07,602 --> 00:43:09,268
I'm just trying to do my job.

995
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:11,337
And the truth is, the
Stone-Ferguson thing

996
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:12,505
is set already.

997
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:15,241
So basically, you
got two choices.

998
00:43:15,243 --> 00:43:18,411
If you believe Reiss could win,
you have him fight Nightmare.

999
00:43:21,249 --> 00:43:23,516
What's the second
choice, then?

1000
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:24,651
Or you sit on the shelf.

1001
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,356
All right, Max.
Thank you.

1002
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:31,691
All right?
Yeah.

1003
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,192
- We cool?
- We're good.

1004
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,360
All right, man.

1005
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,695
All right, man.
Take it easy.

1006
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:36,763
- Fred, see ya later.
- Give Reiss my love.

1007
00:43:36,765 --> 00:43:39,032
I'll give you a call.
Yeah.

1008
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:42,201
Peace.

1009
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,537
Who else we got?
Okay.

1010
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,639
Drake.
Are you kidding me?

1011
00:43:46,641 --> 00:43:48,441
Which side?

1012
00:43:48,443 --> 00:43:49,809
Whoever's side we're going to put him
on, they're going to hate us.

1013
00:43:49,811 --> 00:43:51,444
Pivot couple of Ryans.

1014
00:43:51,446 --> 00:43:53,546
Are they coming?
Yeah, both Ryans.

1015
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:54,881
Well, fucking put
Ryan in the front row.

1016
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:56,816
Okay, Ryans.
Put Ryan Gosling near me.

1017
00:43:56,818 --> 00:43:58,551
Yeah, I'm on it.

1018
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:00,286
No fucking way.

1019
00:44:00,288 --> 00:44:02,221
No way.

1020
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,223
Marcus, it's the only fight Max is
willing to offer. Yo, Reggie, tell him.

1021
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:05,992
It's true, Marcus.

1022
00:44:05,994 --> 00:44:08,294
Then you wait.
It could be a whole year.

1023
00:44:08,296 --> 00:44:10,730
Then he spends some
time with this kid.

1024
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:13,900
Stone and Ferguson fight,
we start talking trash,

1025
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:15,168
we get our rematch.

1026
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,736
I'm not waiting a year.

1027
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:18,071
We're not taking
the Nightmare fight.

1028
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:19,238
Why not?

1029
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,140
He's less popular.

1030
00:44:21,142 --> 00:44:23,409
He's more dangerous.

1031
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,912
Quite frankly, it's
a bad match for you.

1032
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:27,847
If I was the champ, I'd
have to fight him anyway.

1033
00:44:27,849 --> 00:44:29,482
So what's the difference?

1034
00:44:29,484 --> 00:44:32,018
If you're champ, the
juice is worth the squeeze.

1035
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,087
Yeah, we're talking back end
points on pay-per-view, bigger

1036
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:36,322
show money,
and more PR, Reiss.

1037
00:44:36,324 --> 00:44:37,757
You know, I'm
not afraid of him.

1038
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,759
He's hungry.
He's dangerous.

1039
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:41,094
Oh, yeah.

1040
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:43,029
His last fight, he
broke a guy's orbital.

1041
00:44:43,031 --> 00:44:44,664
He's retired now.

1042
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:47,333
Reiss, can't you see
what Max is trying to do?

1043
00:44:47,335 --> 00:44:51,270
She's trying to use you to
build her young fighter.

1044
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:52,672
You deserve better than that.

1045
00:44:52,674 --> 00:44:55,374
She's throwing
you to the wolves.

1046
00:44:55,376 --> 00:44:58,277
I'm a wolf.
You're not listening.

1047
00:44:58,279 --> 00:45:02,281
We're not taking the fight.
That's final.

1048
00:45:02,283 --> 00:45:05,284
Yeah, I had a
feeling you'd say that.

1049
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:06,786
I'm going to LA.

1050
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:08,287
I'm going to do this
camp with Tony Gunn.

1051
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,722
LA?

1052
00:45:09,724 --> 00:45:11,557
Reiss, you don't
need to go to LA.

1053
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:13,426
Are you serious?
Reiss!

1054
00:45:20,201 --> 00:45:22,869
<i>Makes me a little nervous.</i>

1055
00:45:22,871 --> 00:45:24,370
<i>Hard leg kick again.</i>

1056
00:45:24,372 --> 00:45:27,373
<i>Oh, that's a knockout.</i>

1057
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:29,375
<i>That's it.</i>

1058
00:45:29,377 --> 00:45:31,377
<i>A hard, hard punch.</i>

1059
00:45:31,379 --> 00:45:33,312
<i>Not gonna hold up.</i>

1060
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,920
14 more.

1061
00:46:13,922 --> 00:46:15,454
Sorry.

1062
00:46:15,456 --> 00:46:18,024
I must have carried some
extra weight on the flight.

1063
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:19,625
Come on, that's no excuse.

1064
00:46:19,627 --> 00:46:21,260
You're a professional.

1065
00:46:21,262 --> 00:46:23,196
Let's go.
Come on.

1066
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:33,139
Come on.
Back on the bike.

1067
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:49,789
Come on, let's go.
Three more.

1068
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:51,624
- Tony.
- I'm not calling it.

1069
00:46:51,626 --> 00:46:52,959
We're calling it.

1070
00:46:52,961 --> 00:46:55,161
No.

1071
00:46:55,163 --> 00:46:57,830
Reiss, it's not worth it.

1072
00:46:57,832 --> 00:46:59,198
We're not calling it, Ellie.

1073
00:47:02,003 --> 00:47:04,470
Come on.
Let's get going.

1074
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:40,506
Got anything left in you?
Can you cut these last two?

1075
00:47:40,508 --> 00:47:43,609
Tony, he's finished.

1076
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,612
Let him answer.
Reiss.

1077
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:49,515
My body won't sweat anymore.

1078
00:47:49,517 --> 00:47:51,450
I'm done, Tony.

1079
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:56,088
You do realize you'll be
giving up 20% of your purse.

1080
00:47:57,058 --> 00:47:58,124
Yeah.

1081
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:02,028
Fine.

1082
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:04,030
My fee stays the same.

1083
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,650
What's up?

1084
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:28,321
I'm not used to
sharing a locker room.

1085
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:30,823
That's what you get
when you're not the champ.

1086
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:32,291
A roomful of dicks and ass.

1087
00:48:36,431 --> 00:48:38,764
Looking good out there, Corey.

1088
00:48:38,766 --> 00:48:41,901
All right, next time, man.

1089
00:48:41,903 --> 00:48:44,170
Dude.
MCL?

1090
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:45,438
Doc said eight weeks.

1091
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,340
I'd give it 10,
just to be safe.

1092
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:48,407
Definitely, Max.

1093
00:48:48,409 --> 00:48:50,509
Owie.
That sucks.

1094
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,778
Oh, man, you fought
your ass off.

1095
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,014
Those judges were bullshit.

1096
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:57,016
We'll run it back.
All right?

1097
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:58,584
Good fighting.
A little something for you.

1098
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:03,856
Hey, Tony.
How you doing?

1099
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:05,191
Good to see you, Max.

1100
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:07,526
Sorry about the weight.

1101
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:08,627
What happened?

1102
00:49:08,629 --> 00:49:09,929
It's just a really tough cut.

1103
00:49:09,931 --> 00:49:11,097
I'm sorry.

1104
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:12,798
Do we need to
move you to heavy?

1105
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,034
Hell, no.
Those guys are monsters.

1106
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:17,203
Big boys.

1107
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:19,372
All right. Well,
this can't happen again, Reiss.

1108
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:20,940
I know.

1109
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,618
Marcus, what are you doing here?
I got added.

1110
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,220
Fight on the prelims.
Oh, no way.

1111
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:35,888
That's amazing.
Yeah.

1112
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,891
First pro fight.
How'd you get on?

1113
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:41,227
Won by split decision.

1114
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:43,562
Man, that adrenaline dump.

1115
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:45,231
Yeah, you'll get
used to it, man.

1116
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:47,466
I'm proud of you.

1117
00:49:47,468 --> 00:49:48,968
Marcus.
Tony.

1118
00:49:51,806 --> 00:49:53,472
Do your thing, brother.

1119
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,476
Congrats.

1120
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:01,914
That's Marcus, huh?

1121
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,682
Yeah.

1122
00:50:03,684 --> 00:50:06,252
Pretty serious with
those chops he's got.

1123
00:50:46,194 --> 00:50:49,195
<i>Reiss is getting
absolutely pummeled.</i>

1124
00:50:49,197 --> 00:50:51,630
<i>Nightmare is just hammering
him against the cage.</i>

1125
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,566
Reiss, you gotta go.
Come on.

1126
00:50:53,568 --> 00:50:55,067
<i>Reiss opted
to fly out to LA</i>

1127
00:50:55,069 --> 00:50:57,136
<i>and do this camp with Tony
Gunn, one of the rising</i>

1128
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:59,805
<i>stars in the world
of coaching.</i>

1129
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,474
<i>Tony is not looking
pleased right now.</i>

1130
00:51:01,476 --> 00:51:03,542
Hey, who's the joke now?

1131
00:51:03,544 --> 00:51:05,411
<i>Randy Stone is
in attendance tonight.</i>

1132
00:51:05,413 --> 00:51:08,647
<i>Randy of course has his big
pay-per-view heavyweight title</i>

1133
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:09,782
<i>fight coming up with Ferguson.</i>

1134
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:14,753
You're running around
this cage like a clown.

1135
00:51:14,755 --> 00:51:16,255
Oh, shut up, man.

1136
00:51:16,257 --> 00:51:17,656
<i>Changing your camp
is going to throw off...</i>

1137
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,425
Hey, use your distance.

1138
00:51:19,427 --> 00:51:21,494
Calm down.
Breathe.

1139
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:23,262
<i>...right
now, before taking</i>

1140
00:51:23,264 --> 00:51:25,831
<i>on Nightmare, the scariest human
being in Legends promotion.</i>

1141
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:26,999
Get the fuck out
of there, Reiss.

1142
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,667
What are you doing?

1143
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:31,103
<i>Reiss missed weight
for this fight, the first time</i>

1144
00:51:31,105 --> 00:51:32,505
<i>in his career he's
missed weight.</i>

1145
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:34,840
<i>Nightmare, of course,
was kind enough to make</i>

1146
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,408
<i>this fight a catchweight.</i>

1147
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:38,611
<i>I wouldn't
call that kind, Bobby.</i>

1148
00:51:38,613 --> 00:51:40,112
<i>Look at the size
of him in there.</i>

1149
00:51:40,114 --> 00:51:43,082
<i>He's huge.</i>

1150
00:51:43,084 --> 00:51:44,350
<i>Is this even a fight?</i>

1151
00:51:44,352 --> 00:51:45,951
<i>Reiss is on the mat.</i>

1152
00:51:45,953 --> 00:51:49,788
<i>He's trying to get
Nightmare to do jujitsu.</i>

1153
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:51,023
Come on.

1154
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:52,424
Reiss, no one's
here for that shit.

1155
00:51:52,426 --> 00:51:54,527
What are you doing?
Boo!

1156
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:55,694
<i>It's shocking.</i>

1157
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:57,129
He's not even doing anything.
Come on!

1158
00:51:57,131 --> 00:51:59,532
Let's go.

1159
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:01,634
<i>Nightmare is
actually taunting Reiss.</i>

1160
00:52:01,636 --> 00:52:04,870
<i>And the referee has stepped
in and is standing Reiss up.</i>

1161
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:07,273
<i>They're forcing the fight
back to the stand-up.</i>

1162
00:52:07,275 --> 00:52:10,109
<i>The crowd is clearly
unhappy with this display.</i>

1163
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,510
Punish him!
Come on.

1164
00:52:18,786 --> 00:52:19,885
Reiss, come on.
Out of the corner.

1165
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,887
Out of the corner, man.

1166
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,222
<i>Reiss really looks like he
doesn't want to be in there right now.</i>

1167
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:24,723
<i>He's even moving stiff.</i>

1168
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:27,159
<i>It just looks like something's
not right with him.</i>

1169
00:52:27,161 --> 00:52:29,061
<i>And Nightmare's
throwing his hands up...</i>

1170
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,896
We came here to fight!

1171
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,898
<i>...shouting to the crowd.
He's taunting Reiss right now.</i>

1172
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,733
Get in there.
Let's go.

1173
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:36,468
Hey, who's the joke now?

1174
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:40,506
<i>Randy Stone is up,
out of his seat, and shouting at him.</i>

1175
00:52:40,508 --> 00:52:42,741
<i>The crowd is screaming for
Reiss Gibbons to engage.</i>

1176
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:47,479
Come on, get
your head in the game.

1177
00:52:47,481 --> 00:52:50,816
Look at him.
He's embarrassing you.

1178
00:52:50,818 --> 00:52:52,251
Get in there!

1179
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:54,687
Come on!

1180
00:52:54,689 --> 00:52:56,855
Come on, Reiss!
Reiss, come on!

1181
00:52:56,857 --> 00:52:58,257
<i>Reiss fires
alternative jab.</i>

1182
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:00,826
<i>Nightmare follows up
with a fast counter.</i>

1183
00:53:00,828 --> 00:53:03,095
<i>This is starting to
get embarrassing.</i>

1184
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:09,501
Hey, Reiss, would you fight?

1185
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,373
Look at your boy!

1186
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:15,507
<i>Knockout!</i>

1187
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:39,965
I'm here with the former
Light Heavyweight Legends

1188
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,701
Champion, Reiss Gibbons.

1189
00:53:42,703 --> 00:53:45,037
I hate asking questions right
after a knockout, Reiss.

1190
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:46,572
But if you can, how are
you feeling right now?

1191
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:51,810
I've been around a long time.

1192
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:54,313
And, you know, I've fought
the best of the best.

1193
00:53:58,486 --> 00:53:59,752
I think it's the
last time you're

1194
00:53:59,754 --> 00:54:02,388
going to see me in the cage.

1195
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:03,722
What,
are you saying you're

1196
00:54:03,724 --> 00:54:05,124
ready to retire right now?

1197
00:54:07,728 --> 00:54:10,896
I never started this
sport to be average.

1198
00:54:10,898 --> 00:54:17,336
I wanted to be the best,
and I no longer am the best.

1199
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:20,806
So I want to say thank you to my
coach for this camp, Tony Gunn.

1200
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:26,845
Where's my coach?

1201
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,847
<i>It's been an
honor to announce your fights</i>

1202
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,015
<i>all these years, Reiss.</i>

1203
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,784
<i>Sorry to see you
go out like this.</i>

1204
00:54:31,786 --> 00:54:33,752
<i>We wish you nothing
but the best.</i>

1205
00:54:33,754 --> 00:54:36,689
<i>Reiss Gibbons,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1206
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:54,306
Where the fuck did you go?

1207
00:54:54,308 --> 00:54:56,875
I'm not sticking
around for that shit.

1208
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:58,210
What do you mean?

1209
00:54:58,212 --> 00:54:59,945
What do I mean?

1210
00:54:59,947 --> 00:55:01,880
It's nice to be the last fucking
person in the entire arena

1211
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,115
who knows you're retiring.

1212
00:55:03,117 --> 00:55:04,616
A waste of my fucking time.

1213
00:55:04,618 --> 00:55:07,453
And what the fuck were
you doing out there?

1214
00:55:07,455 --> 00:55:09,888
Everything we worked on,
everything we trained...

1215
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,990
You did nothing.

1216
00:55:11,992 --> 00:55:13,292
Nothing.

1217
00:55:13,294 --> 00:55:15,894
Where the fuck were you?

1218
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,397
I'm out of here.
Good luck to you.

1219
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,526
You're a
million miles away.

1220
00:56:31,539 --> 00:56:32,871
I don't think I
got anymore, Ellie.

1221
00:56:51,759 --> 00:56:52,891
What happens next?

1222
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:58,497
Whatever we want.

1223
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:03,168
We could get that farm
we've always dreamed of, hm?

1224
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,736
I could get a horse.

1225
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:11,176
What the hell are we
going to do with a horse?

1226
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:13,078
I've always wanted a horse.

1227
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:28,126
Reiss, what's up, bro?

1228
00:57:28,128 --> 00:57:30,095
I know you always get
mad when I do this, Roy,

1229
00:57:30,097 --> 00:57:32,865
but I want to pull
some of my money out.

1230
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:38,470
Reiss, when was
the last time you

1231
00:57:38,472 --> 00:57:40,472
took a look at your finances?

1232
00:57:40,474 --> 00:57:41,773
I don't know.

1233
00:57:41,775 --> 00:57:43,041
I don't deal with
that side of things.

1234
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,878
You're in the red.
That can't be right.

1235
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,546
I'm afraid it is.

1236
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:48,881
What about the account I
put aside for when I get old?

1237
00:57:48,883 --> 00:57:50,215
You kept dipping into it.

1238
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:53,719
That Swiss account?

1239
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:55,554
Take a look.

1240
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:04,630
You were supposed
to take care of me.

1241
00:58:04,632 --> 00:58:06,965
I'm not your dad, bruv.
I'm here to advise you.

1242
00:58:06,967 --> 00:58:08,734
Then where was the advice?

1243
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:11,470
You had one job, one
fucking job, Reggie.

1244
00:58:11,472 --> 00:58:13,505
Take care of my money.
Where is that now?

1245
00:58:13,507 --> 00:58:15,073
Reiss, you don't listen.

1246
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:16,842
Look, can you sit down?

1247
00:58:16,844 --> 00:58:19,144
Reiss, sit down, bruv.

1248
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:24,983
Now, listen.

1249
00:58:24,985 --> 00:58:27,085
Your outgoings were too high.

1250
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,820
Sponsorship deals,
they're finned.

1251
00:58:28,822 --> 00:58:30,489
Pay-per-view back end,
that went out the window when you lost

1252
00:58:30,491 --> 00:58:33,759
the belt. Bruv, flying
your whole family to LA

1253
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:35,861
for that extravagant
purchase, first class,

1254
00:58:35,863 --> 00:58:38,030
for this Nightmare training
camp you didn't even need.

1255
00:58:38,032 --> 00:58:39,598
Look, eventually the
money is going to run out

1256
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,000
when it's no longer coming in.
It's that simple.

1257
00:58:42,002 --> 00:58:43,435
And the poor
investments you made...

1258
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,938
The CBD oil, the high-tech
start-up companies.

1259
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:49,508
Bruv, they all went
bust within a year.

1260
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:51,510
And I told you not to do that.

1261
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:55,547
I'm never going back
to that life, Reggie.

1262
00:58:55,549 --> 00:58:56,682
I know.

1263
00:58:56,684 --> 00:58:59,785
Ellie is going to freak out.

1264
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:01,253
What do I do?

1265
00:59:03,524 --> 00:59:06,625
You gotta tell her the truth.
She's going to find out.

1266
01:00:55,302 --> 01:00:58,336
This is definitely authentic?

1267
01:00:58,338 --> 01:01:01,673
Can't get that
label anywhere else.

1268
01:01:01,675 --> 01:01:03,542
How come you're selling them?

1269
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,814
Are you okay to do
a bank transfer?

1270
01:01:08,816 --> 01:01:10,415
Yeah.

1271
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:16,655
Thanks.

1272
01:01:23,831 --> 01:01:27,599
Well, thank you.

1273
01:01:55,963 --> 01:01:57,229
Nice to meet you, man.

1274
01:01:57,231 --> 01:01:58,630
Big fan.
Big fan.

1275
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,799
Massive fan, man.

1276
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:02,134
Nice, man.

1277
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:03,869
My nephew, you're
his favorite fighter.

1278
01:02:03,871 --> 01:02:05,237
His name's Kyle.

1279
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:06,471
What's your name, bro?

1280
01:02:06,473 --> 01:02:07,806
Jerome, man.
Jerome.

1281
01:02:07,808 --> 01:02:10,075
I'm Darryl, man.
I'm Darryl.

1282
01:02:10,077 --> 01:02:11,977
Yeah, the fight with Anderson
was his favorite, yeah?

1283
01:02:11,979 --> 01:02:15,247
Yo.
Kyle, guess who I'm with.

1284
01:02:15,249 --> 01:02:16,715
Say something to
the camera, man.

1285
01:02:16,717 --> 01:02:19,417
Yo, Kyle, stay in school, man.
Be good, okay?

1286
01:02:19,419 --> 01:02:21,486
Yeah, yeah.

1287
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:23,421
Yo, man.
I appreciate it, man.

1288
01:02:23,423 --> 01:02:26,391
Stick in there, man.
You mean the world to us, man.

1289
01:02:26,393 --> 01:02:27,592
Five-time champ, man.

1290
01:02:27,594 --> 01:02:30,929
Five times!

1291
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:33,465
Pleasure.

1292
01:02:35,903 --> 01:02:38,403
Yes!

1293
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:58,256
Reiss.

1294
01:02:58,258 --> 01:03:01,259
Go back to sleep, baby.

1295
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:34,960
Reiss, get dressed.

1296
01:03:34,962 --> 01:03:37,395
Bruv, it's 6:30
in the morning.

1297
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:38,897
Yeah, I know.

1298
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:40,332
And Ferguson's out of the
Randy Stone fight. What?

1299
01:03:40,334 --> 01:03:42,234
I know. Look, Reiss,
this is our chance.

1300
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:44,302
You can get a rematch.
I'm retired.

1301
01:03:44,304 --> 01:03:46,571
Retirement?
Reiss, stop talking nonsense.

1302
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:48,907
Look, I've been calling Max all morning.
What did she say?

1303
01:03:48,909 --> 01:03:50,242
Well, she hasn't
returned my calls yet,

1304
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:52,577
but that's 'cause
she needs convincing.

1305
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,246
The fight's in a few weeks.

1306
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:56,147
Reiss, you've taken a fight
on a week's notice before.

1307
01:03:56,149 --> 01:03:58,083
Come on.
Get your head in the game.

1308
01:03:58,085 --> 01:03:59,251
My head's not in it, man.
Oh, Reiss.

1309
01:03:59,253 --> 01:04:01,019
Come on.
Look, this is yours.

1310
01:04:01,021 --> 01:04:03,088
This is your opportunity.
I can't.

1311
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:04,489
What do you mean you can't?

1312
01:04:04,491 --> 01:04:06,591
What's... Reiss, this isn't you, man.
Talk to me.

1313
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:08,260
I'm sorry, Reggie.

1314
01:04:08,262 --> 01:04:10,595
See yourself out.
Reiss, stop. Stop.

1315
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:12,264
Look, this isn't you, yeah?
Alpha, man.

1316
01:04:12,266 --> 01:04:14,032
Look, stop all the weakness.

1317
01:04:14,034 --> 01:04:15,433
We'll sit down, we'll have a coffee,
and we'll talk about it, yeah?

1318
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:18,937
Reggie, see yourself out.

1319
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:48,466
Are you sure this is
what you want to do?

1320
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:50,702
Yes.

1321
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,873
Why are you turning this down?

1322
01:04:54,875 --> 01:04:56,574
Ellie.

1323
01:04:56,576 --> 01:05:02,047
Why are you turning this down?

1324
01:05:02,049 --> 01:05:03,748
I don't want to fight anymore.

1325
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,550
Why?

1326
01:05:10,991 --> 01:05:12,457
I'm afraid.

1327
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:19,564
Good.

1328
01:05:22,336 --> 01:05:24,169
Finally you got
that out of the way.

1329
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:34,512
I have poured everything
I've got into this, into us.

1330
01:05:34,514 --> 01:05:37,415
I've sacrificed everything.

1331
01:05:37,417 --> 01:05:41,686
I've put my whole life
on hold.

1332
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:43,321
Do you know why?

1333
01:05:44,925 --> 01:05:46,691
Because I believe in you,
Reiss.

1334
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:23,995
I can't believe you have
the nerve to follow me here.

1335
01:06:23,997 --> 01:06:25,330
Look, Max...
No.

1336
01:06:25,332 --> 01:06:26,731
You haven't even
heard my question yet.

1337
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:27,899
I don't need to hear
your question, Reggie.

1338
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:29,067
The answer is no.

1339
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:30,568
Listen, Max, that's our fight.

1340
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:31,903
Oh, man.

1341
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:33,671
You know, you got a
lot of balls, right?

1342
01:06:33,673 --> 01:06:36,074
First you lose the first two,
and then you officially retire?

1343
01:06:36,076 --> 01:06:37,475
Fuck you.

1344
01:06:37,477 --> 01:06:40,178
Look... Listen, Max.
It's a mistake, okay?

1345
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:42,247
It's Nightmare's fight. Sorry.
I'm announcing it right now.

1346
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:43,314
Max, just listen.
Max.

1347
01:06:43,316 --> 01:06:45,250
No.
It's a mistake.

1348
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:47,018
You know what? Reggie, you're really
bugging the shit out of me right now.

1349
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:48,086
Just give me one minute.

1350
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:49,754
No. No.
Just I'll explain...

1351
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:51,356
Do you want me to call security?
You wouldn't do that.

1352
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:53,425
Yeah, I will.
We've got 100 missed calls.

1353
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:54,592
I could arrest you
for stalking.

1354
01:06:54,594 --> 01:06:56,161
Well, if you
returned my calls,

1355
01:06:56,163 --> 01:06:57,762
you wouldn't have so many
calls in the first place.

1356
01:06:57,764 --> 01:06:59,664
Listen, I gave Reiss every
fucking chance there was.

1357
01:06:59,666 --> 01:07:02,434
It broke my heart when
he lost that fight.

1358
01:07:02,436 --> 01:07:04,002
I love the guy.

1359
01:07:04,004 --> 01:07:05,437
But at a certain point, you
gotta draw the line, okay?

1360
01:07:05,439 --> 01:07:07,105
It's just business, Reggie.
Max.

1361
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:09,174
Max, please!

1362
01:07:09,176 --> 01:07:11,609
Sorry. Are you fucking crazy?
I'm sorry.

1363
01:07:11,611 --> 01:07:13,011
But just hear me out, Max.
Okay.

1364
01:07:13,013 --> 01:07:15,213
Okay, listen.
You got 30 fucking seconds.

1365
01:07:15,215 --> 01:07:18,049
Thank you. Look, Max.
Look, you said it yourself.

1366
01:07:18,051 --> 01:07:19,384
You love an underdog
story, right?

1367
01:07:19,386 --> 01:07:21,019
Well, this is the
biggest underdog story

1368
01:07:21,021 --> 01:07:23,455
in the history of Legends,
maybe in the history of MMA, all right.

1369
01:07:23,457 --> 01:07:25,023
The first time they
fought, Reiss was the king,

1370
01:07:25,025 --> 01:07:26,224
and he went through a
murderer's row to get there,

1371
01:07:26,226 --> 01:07:27,892
went through so
much hell and back.

1372
01:07:27,894 --> 01:07:29,894
And you've been there. You've seen it.
You know this, right?

1373
01:07:29,896 --> 01:07:31,396
This time, the roles are
completely reversed, right?

1374
01:07:31,398 --> 01:07:32,730
He's the one who's got to
go through the trenches

1375
01:07:32,732 --> 01:07:33,865
and he's got to
dig deep and he's

1376
01:07:33,867 --> 01:07:35,033
got to win this time, right?

1377
01:07:35,035 --> 01:07:36,801
The odds are
stacked against him,

1378
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:38,536
and there's only one fighter on
that roster that can sell out

1379
01:07:38,538 --> 01:07:40,038
that arena within three weeks
lead up time that you've got left.

1380
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:42,140
And that's Reiss, right?

1381
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:45,477
And Max, just like you, I'm just trying
to do my job, just like you are, right?

1382
01:07:45,479 --> 01:07:47,045
That's all we can do, right?

1383
01:07:47,047 --> 01:07:48,780
So what do you say?

1384
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,318
Your 30 seconds are up.

1385
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:02,227
Hey, man.
How you doing?

1386
01:08:02,229 --> 01:08:03,495
Nice to see you, too.

1387
01:08:03,497 --> 01:08:04,829
Pleasure, as always.

1388
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:06,164
Hey, thanks
for having me on.

1389
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:07,832
Yeah.
Thanks for making the time.

1390
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:10,668
Sure.

1391
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:13,671
So, Max, it's always
interesting to say the least

1392
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:15,440
when you come in the studio.

1393
01:08:15,442 --> 01:08:17,842
Tell me, what's the
latest with Ferguson.

1394
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:20,411
He's injured. He's out of the fight.
What's going on?

1395
01:08:20,413 --> 01:08:22,247
Yeah, well, it's a drag.

1396
01:08:22,249 --> 01:08:24,916
It's too bad, but the
MRI results came back.

1397
01:08:24,918 --> 01:08:27,018
And, I mean, Ferguson's...

1398
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,686
He's out.

1399
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:30,588
He's out of the fight completely, huh?
Yeah, there's no way.

1400
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:32,524
I mean, it's going to be at least
nine months till he could fight again.

1401
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:34,526
He dropped this bombshell.
Your main event is now off.

1402
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:36,027
Yeah.

1403
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:37,362
What does this mean
for the rest of the card?

1404
01:08:37,364 --> 01:08:39,364
Well, I mean, come on.

1405
01:08:39,366 --> 01:08:40,765
You know this business.

1406
01:08:40,767 --> 01:08:42,100
The show must go on, right?

1407
01:08:42,102 --> 01:08:43,701
Right, right.

1408
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,471
So you have an opponent in
mind for Randy Stone, then?

1409
01:08:46,473 --> 01:08:48,273
Uh, yeah.
Yes.

1410
01:08:48,275 --> 01:08:51,309
Yes. Yes.

1411
01:08:51,311 --> 01:08:52,977
Yes, I do.

1412
01:08:52,979 --> 01:09:00,285
In just three weeks' time,
Randy Stone will be fighting...

1413
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:03,721
Come on.
Come on.

1414
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,557
Randy Stone is going to
be fighting Reiss Gibbons.

1415
01:09:05,559 --> 01:09:07,725
Are you
fucking shitting me?

1416
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:10,061
I just cost myself
advertising revenue.

1417
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:11,162
Shit.
Woo!

1418
01:09:11,164 --> 01:09:12,997
Fuck.
I need to stop talking here.

1419
01:09:12,999 --> 01:09:14,799
That's big fucking news.

1420
01:09:14,801 --> 01:09:16,734
First, you drop
that Reiss is coming

1421
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:18,069
out of retirement,
moving to heavyweight,

1422
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:19,337
and now I'm speechless.

1423
01:09:19,339 --> 01:09:20,405
Your spee...
Well, that is a first.

1424
01:09:39,593 --> 01:09:43,528
What are you doing
here, Hollywood?

1425
01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:46,431
Yeah, I deserve that.

1426
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:48,499
I've been offered the
Randy Stone rematch.

1427
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:52,070
Yeah, I heard.

1428
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:56,674
Everyone's counting
me out against him.

1429
01:09:56,676 --> 01:09:57,942
Everyone.

1430
01:10:00,213 --> 01:10:03,014
What do you think?

1431
01:10:03,016 --> 01:10:05,116
Now you care what I think?

1432
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:07,018
I think you shouldn't have
taken the Nightmare fight.

1433
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:09,787
I know.

1434
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:13,391
I hated watching that fight.

1435
01:10:13,393 --> 01:10:15,627
You broke my heart, Reiss.

1436
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:16,761
I know I did, Marcus.

1437
01:10:19,532 --> 01:10:21,466
But I need to know.

1438
01:10:21,468 --> 01:10:22,700
Do you think I can take him?

1439
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:39,817
You cut one corner, pull
one Hollywood bullshit move,

1440
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,887
I'll kick your ass myself.

1441
01:10:42,889 --> 01:10:44,155
You understand that?

1442
01:10:51,665 --> 01:10:53,731
You can beat him
on the ground.

1443
01:10:53,733 --> 01:10:55,266
He hasn't been tested there.

1444
01:10:55,268 --> 01:10:57,168
You need to take him
into deep waters.

1445
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:05,176
If you want to win
this fight, Reiss,

1446
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:06,477
you need to make it
a technical fight.

1447
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,467
<i>I'm feeling
good about myself.</i>

1448
01:11:29,469 --> 01:11:31,369
<i>I'm feeling good about
this charitable thing</i>

1449
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:33,371
I'm doing, giving this
broke son of a bitch

1450
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:36,541
another chance at glory.

1451
01:11:36,543 --> 01:11:38,142
<i>You can talk about
your being charitable,</i>

1452
01:11:38,144 --> 01:11:39,377
<i>but that's just talk.</i>

1453
01:11:39,379 --> 01:11:41,045
That's all you have
for this fight.

1454
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,981
<i>I can grapple, I can strike,
I can take you to the ground.</i>

1455
01:11:43,983 --> 01:11:45,550
I'll beat you at
everything, all right?

1456
01:11:45,552 --> 01:11:46,951
I'll beat you on the ground.

1457
01:11:46,953 --> 01:11:48,486
I'll beat you on the feet.

1458
01:11:48,488 --> 01:11:50,621
<i>I'll beat you in wrestling.
I'll beat you in jujitsu.</i>

1459
01:11:50,623 --> 01:11:52,290
<i>I'll beat you in
chess, checkers,</i>

1460
01:11:52,292 --> 01:11:53,725
a fucking spelling bee.

1461
01:11:53,727 --> 01:11:56,894
I'm better than you, Reiss.

1462
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:58,396
<i>No more flukes.</i>

1463
01:11:58,398 --> 01:11:59,497
<i>No more jokes.</i>

1464
01:11:59,499 --> 01:12:00,798
<i>I'm stepping in there serious.</i>

1465
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,567
<i>I'm ready to throw down.</i>

1466
01:12:02,569 --> 01:12:03,968
<i>I'm going to bring
that whole toolbox,</i>

1467
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:05,903
<i>and I'm gonna use it on you.</i>

1468
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,373
<i>Come fight night, I'm going to
show you, man, the real Reiss.</i>

1469
01:12:24,691 --> 01:12:26,591
You know, I know what
I did wrong last time.

1470
01:12:26,593 --> 01:12:28,359
This time I'm gonna go in
there, and I'm gonna make

1471
01:12:28,361 --> 01:12:29,927
sure I execute my game plan.

1472
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:31,329
I'm gonna finish it, man.

1473
01:12:31,331 --> 01:12:34,198
Technically I knocked
your dick in the dirt.

1474
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,768
Technically I'm
the champion now.

1475
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:39,203
<i>I'm the baddest man
in the world now.</i>

1476
01:12:39,205 --> 01:12:42,039
<i>This will be the
ugliest fight of your life.</i>

1477
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:44,709
<i>He's stronger than you.</i>

1478
01:12:44,711 --> 01:12:46,277
<i>He's meaner than you.</i>

1479
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:49,380
<i>But you have a bigger heart.</i>

1480
01:12:49,382 --> 01:12:50,448
You're a martial artist.

1481
01:13:32,826 --> 01:13:35,560
Remember the Mitchell fight?

1482
01:13:35,562 --> 01:13:38,429
Yeah.
You knocked him out.

1483
01:13:38,431 --> 01:13:42,834
Yeah, eventually.

1484
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:46,671
First time we fought
it didn't go so well.

1485
01:13:46,673 --> 01:13:50,007
I underestimated him,
overlooked him, kind

1486
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:52,510
of similar to what you did.

1487
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:55,513
Not quite as bad.

1488
01:13:55,515 --> 01:14:03,120
Hell, came back, looked at
the films, took it serious.

1489
01:14:03,122 --> 01:14:05,923
Like you do this time.

1490
01:14:05,925 --> 01:14:11,362
You're better than him,
been doing it longer.

1491
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:14,866
Got more heart.

1492
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:19,937
Show all that out there,
and he can't beat you.

1493
01:14:19,939 --> 01:14:24,375
So... You got it, man.

1494
01:14:24,377 --> 01:14:25,943
You got this.

1495
01:14:34,787 --> 01:14:37,054
<i>And here
we go, the rematch</i>

1496
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:38,556
we've all been waiting for.

1497
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:42,393
Randy Stone, Reiss Gibbons 2.

1498
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,562
<i>Only a short time ago,
Reiss he announced</i>

1499
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:47,665
<i>his retirement after that
devastating loss to Nightmare.</i>

1500
01:14:47,667 --> 01:14:49,300
<i>But here he is with
another opportunity</i>

1501
01:14:49,302 --> 01:14:52,336
<i>to climb the mountain
again and redeem himself.</i>

1502
01:14:52,338 --> 01:14:54,138
<i>Everybody is
counting Reiss Gibbons out.</i>

1503
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:56,741
<i>He's coming into this fight
as the clear underdog.</i>

1504
01:14:56,743 --> 01:14:58,476
<i>Do you think he can do it?</i>

1505
01:14:58,478 --> 01:15:02,413
We'll soon find out, Bobby.

1506
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:08,185
<i>5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</i>

1507
01:16:10,383 --> 01:16:12,149
Reiss!

1508
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:15,586
Bouncing back from a
knockout is so tough.

1509
01:16:15,588 --> 01:16:18,389
<i>Can Reiss overcome the mental
demons he had to endure when he</i>

1510
01:16:18,391 --> 01:16:21,492
<i>got knocked out
by Randy Stone?</i>

1511
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:24,228
This was his
first ever knockout.

1512
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:26,397
<i>He had movie deals.
He had sneaker deals.</i>

1513
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:28,099
<i>He had his own mouth guard.</i>

1514
01:16:28,101 --> 01:16:32,436
<i>And in one night, one punch,
one man took it all away... Randy Stone.</i>

1515
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:38,075
<i>I can't imagine what it
feels like to be Reiss Gibbons</i>

1516
01:16:38,077 --> 01:16:40,845
<i>right now as Randy
makes his walk.</i>

1517
01:16:40,847 --> 01:16:44,515
<i>Reiss's heart must be
beating out of his chest.</i>

1518
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:47,184
<i>And of course, despite
being a heavyweight,</i>

1519
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:50,021
<i>Randy Stone doesn't have
to worry about making 205.</i>

1520
01:16:50,023 --> 01:16:52,023
<i>He can come in at
his natural weight...</i>

1521
01:16:52,025 --> 01:16:55,126
<i>Stronger, meaner,
and more ferocious.</i>

1522
01:16:55,128 --> 01:16:56,861
<i>What Reiss has gone
through in the past year</i>

1523
01:16:56,863 --> 01:16:58,696
<i>is a roller coaster ride.</i>

1524
01:16:58,698 --> 01:17:01,365
<i>And the big question,
can he battle back</i>

1525
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:02,967
<i>and reclaim his spot?</i>

1526
01:17:02,969 --> 01:17:04,135
<i>We're moments away.</i>

1527
01:17:04,137 --> 01:17:06,437
<i>Let's take it to our emcee.</i>

1528
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:20,284
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
it is now time for our main event.</i>

1529
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:24,722
The moment you've
all been waiting for,

1530
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:29,126
live from London, England!

1531
01:17:29,128 --> 01:17:33,497
And brought to you by Lex.

1532
01:17:33,499 --> 01:17:38,369
Are you ready
for a new legend?

1533
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:51,749
This fight is scheduled
for five five-minute rounds

1534
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:57,521
for the vacant Heavyweight
Legends Champion of the World.

1535
01:17:57,523 --> 01:18:03,427
Introducing first, he
hails from London, England,

1536
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:09,166
weighing in at 217
pounds, Reiss Gibbons.

1537
01:18:12,705 --> 01:18:18,676
His opponent comes to
us via Cincinnati, Ohio.

1538
01:18:18,678 --> 01:18:23,848
Weighing in at 235
pounds, the reigning,

1539
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:27,718
the defending Light
Heavyweight Legends Champion

1540
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:33,557
of the World, Randy Stone.

1541
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:41,899
<i>Here we go.</i>

1542
01:18:41,901 --> 01:18:43,400
<i>No more waiting.</i>

1543
01:18:43,402 --> 01:18:45,970
<i>I cannot believe the
moment has finally arrived.</i>

1544
01:18:45,972 --> 01:18:50,407
<i>The bad blood, the trash talk, the tension
so thick you can cut it with a knife...</i>

1545
01:18:50,409 --> 01:18:51,809
Okay, gentlemen.

1546
01:18:51,811 --> 01:18:53,310
We went over the rules
in the locker room.

1547
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:55,079
Any questions from
the challenger?

1548
01:18:55,081 --> 01:18:57,214
Champion, any questions?

1549
01:18:57,216 --> 01:18:59,216
Touch gloves if you want.

1550
01:18:59,218 --> 01:19:00,618
Back to your corners.

1551
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:04,989
Come on, show him!

1552
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:06,056
Come on, Reiss.

1553
01:19:09,662 --> 01:19:11,495
<i>We are ready for war.</i>

1554
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:12,630
Fight.

1555
01:19:15,101 --> 01:19:17,835
<i>And Reiss springs at
him and immediately presses</i>

1556
01:19:17,837 --> 01:19:19,603
<i>Randy Stone against the cage.</i>

1557
01:19:19,605 --> 01:19:21,005
<i>He's a man
on a mission.</i>

1558
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:23,507
What, are you gonna
hump my leg all night?

1559
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:25,943
<i>Reiss is wasting
no time in there.</i>

1560
01:19:25,945 --> 01:19:29,914
<i>We just don't know if we'll
see the champion from the past.</i>

1561
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:32,583
<i>Reiss is firing off
some great punches.</i>

1562
01:19:32,585 --> 01:19:34,185
<i>Reiss is
really moving well.</i>

1563
01:19:34,187 --> 01:19:35,853
<i>He's displaying
great head movement.</i>

1564
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:37,521
<i>He's looking really confident.</i>

1565
01:19:37,523 --> 01:19:39,023
<i>And Reiss lands
a vicious takedown.</i>

1566
01:19:39,025 --> 01:19:40,424
There you go.

1567
01:19:40,426 --> 01:19:42,526
<i>And immediately
passes to side control.</i>

1568
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:44,528
<i>Randy is so strong.</i>

1569
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,930
<i>He gets up right away.</i>

1570
01:19:51,437 --> 01:19:54,438
That's it, Reiss.
Come on!

1571
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:57,141
<i>Reiss is showing a much
improved arsenal of strikes.</i>

1572
01:19:57,143 --> 01:20:00,945
<i>But Randy counters with a great Superman
punch, forcing Reiss to back up.</i>

1573
01:20:00,947 --> 01:20:02,112
Get off the cage!

1574
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,318
<i>And Randy tosses
Reiss to the ground.</i>

1575
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,220
<i>He's just so powerful.</i>

1576
01:20:09,222 --> 01:20:11,222
<i>Randy's
raining down punches.</i>

1577
01:20:11,224 --> 01:20:12,990
<i>Reiss is throwing up
one submission attempt</i>

1578
01:20:12,992 --> 01:20:14,391
<i>after another,
but to no avail.</i>

1579
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:15,893
Reiss, come on!

1580
01:20:15,895 --> 01:20:17,394
<i>Randy shrugs them
off like they were nothing.</i>

1581
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:18,996
<i>Signature
Danny Thicket.</i>

1582
01:20:18,998 --> 01:20:20,965
<i>Fight mean, and make them pay.</i>

1583
01:20:20,967 --> 01:20:22,733
<i>Well, that's the
way it's looking right now.</i>

1584
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:24,735
<i>It may not be an issue if
he has to conserve himself.</i>

1585
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:25,803
Come on.
Cover up.

1586
01:20:31,177 --> 01:20:32,643
Reiss!

1587
01:20:35,248 --> 01:20:36,680
<i>Reiss looks hurt.</i>

1588
01:20:36,682 --> 01:20:38,515
<i>Randy looks like he may
have torn something when</i>

1589
01:20:38,517 --> 01:20:40,985
<i>he opened up Reiss's guard.</i>

1590
01:20:40,987 --> 01:20:42,753
Randy just won't stop.

1591
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:46,190
He smells blood, and he's
going after him, Bobby.

1592
01:20:46,192 --> 01:20:47,925
Come on.
Get off the bottom.

1593
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:50,861
Don't stay down there.
No mercy.

1594
01:20:50,863 --> 01:20:53,264
<i>And Randy Stone is the
last guy you want on top of you</i>

1595
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:54,932
<i>when you're not feeling well.</i>

1596
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:57,601
<i>It looks like something went
really wrong when Reiss tried</i>

1597
01:20:57,603 --> 01:20:59,837
<i>to lock in
that triangle choke.</i>

1598
01:20:59,839 --> 01:21:01,338
We worked on this.

1599
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:04,842
<i>Randy has such
vicious knees and elbows.</i>

1600
01:21:04,844 --> 01:21:06,043
Come on, Reiss.

1601
01:21:06,045 --> 01:21:07,778
Get off of there.

1602
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,346
You gotta get off there.

1603
01:21:09,348 --> 01:21:11,782
<i>And Reiss just looks
completely manhandled.</i>

1604
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:13,117
<i>Reiss tries to escape.</i>

1605
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:15,452
<i>Randy locks him into
a guillotine choke.</i>

1606
01:21:15,454 --> 01:21:16,954
It looks tight.

1607
01:21:16,956 --> 01:21:18,055
<i>It looks really tight.</i>

1608
01:21:18,057 --> 01:21:19,356
Hold on.

1609
01:21:19,358 --> 01:21:20,791
<i>This might
end the first round.</i>

1610
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:22,459
<i>And he's reaching for
a different position.</i>

1611
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:24,862
<i>He transitions to
a bulldog choke.</i>

1612
01:21:24,864 --> 01:21:26,630
I don't think he
can do anything.

1613
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:29,199
20 seconds left.
Come on.

1614
01:21:29,201 --> 01:21:30,634
<i>Randy is pressing
down on the back of his neck.</i>

1615
01:21:30,636 --> 01:21:33,537
<i>That's 235 pounds on the
back of Reiss's neck.</i>

1616
01:21:33,539 --> 01:21:35,372
<i>With the right amount of
pressure, he could snap his neck.</i>

1617
01:21:35,374 --> 01:21:36,807
Don't tap.
Don't you tap.

1618
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:38,309
<i>Reiss is holding
on for dear life.</i>

1619
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:40,144
<i>I don't know how he's not
unconscious right now.</i>

1620
01:21:40,146 --> 01:21:41,645
<i>TJ Steele is peering in.</i>

1621
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:43,580
<i>It looks like he's
trying to end this fight.</i>

1622
01:21:43,582 --> 01:21:45,549
<i>Reiss is in
a lot of trouble.</i>

1623
01:21:45,551 --> 01:21:47,484
<i>He does not look like he's
gonna get out of this.</i>

1624
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:49,920
<i>TJ Steele might
end this fight right now.</i>

1625
01:21:49,922 --> 01:21:51,889
<i>Reiss is about to
go unconscious.</i>

1626
01:21:51,891 --> 01:21:53,824
<i>I can't believe
he's still holding on.</i>

1627
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:56,827
<i>And saved by the horn.</i>

1628
01:22:01,233 --> 01:22:03,567
<i>I can't believe he
survived that round.</i>

1629
01:22:03,569 --> 01:22:06,070
<i>Look at him. Reiss is
clearly shaken by that.</i>

1630
01:22:06,072 --> 01:22:08,105
<i>He's not even sure
what corner to go to.</i>

1631
01:22:08,107 --> 01:22:09,673
<i>He doesn't even
know where he's at.</i>

1632
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:11,442
<i>He is completely out of it.</i>

1633
01:22:11,444 --> 01:22:12,776
<i>And look at
the way he's walking.</i>

1634
01:22:12,778 --> 01:22:15,012
<i>Something is clearly
wrong with Reiss' leg.</i>

1635
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:16,680
<i>Randy is basically
mocking him.</i>

1636
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:22,252
Take a deep breath.
Deep breaths, buddy. Talk to me.

1637
01:22:22,254 --> 01:22:23,420
What's going on?

1638
01:22:23,422 --> 01:22:24,588
Fuck, Marcus, man.

1639
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:27,424
I've torn my groin.

1640
01:22:27,426 --> 01:22:29,626
Can you fight?
Should I stop it?

1641
01:22:29,628 --> 01:22:31,095
No, don't fucking stop it.

1642
01:22:31,097 --> 01:22:32,629
All right.

1643
01:22:32,631 --> 01:22:34,531
Forget about your groin
and start thinking

1644
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:36,200
how you're gonna
beat this guy.

1645
01:22:36,202 --> 01:22:37,701
See him go to
the wrong quarter?

1646
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:39,269
He went to the wrong
fucking corner.

1647
01:22:39,271 --> 01:22:41,538
The guy is lost.
The guy has already lost.

1648
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:44,141
You keep those take-downs clean.
Use your weight.

1649
01:22:44,143 --> 01:22:45,376
John,
you got anything for him?

1650
01:22:45,378 --> 01:22:46,877
Those strikes,
they're nice and clean.

1651
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:48,812
Keep working those
combinations like we worked on.

1652
01:22:48,814 --> 01:22:51,615
Finish this round right,
we'll be drinking margaritas in an hour.

1653
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:55,719
Deep breath.
Deep breath. Calm down.

1654
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:57,388
Come on.

1655
01:22:57,390 --> 01:22:59,289
You've done this a long...
You've done this a long time.

1656
01:23:00,826 --> 01:23:01,892
You can do this.

1657
01:23:07,233 --> 01:23:08,966
<i>Here we go.
Round two.</i>

1658
01:23:08,968 --> 01:23:10,901
<i>Reiss is limping
off the stall.</i>

1659
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:13,303
<i>You can just see
by the look on his face</i>

1660
01:23:13,305 --> 01:23:15,005
<i>that he's in agony.</i>

1661
01:23:15,007 --> 01:23:18,308
<i>He's trying his best not to
show it, but Reiss is in pain.</i>

1662
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:19,810
<i>And Stone knows it.</i>

1663
01:23:19,812 --> 01:23:22,813
<i>Stone is a natural finisher,
and I guarantee you,</i>

1664
01:23:22,815 --> 01:23:25,249
<i>he's going to look to end
this fight in this round.</i>

1665
01:23:25,251 --> 01:23:28,252
<i>Reiss has just opened
a cut over Randy's eye.</i>

1666
01:23:28,254 --> 01:23:30,754
<i>There is no
quit in Reiss Gibbons.</i>

1667
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:32,656
<i>Pain or no pain,
he's here to fight.</i>

1668
01:23:32,658 --> 01:23:34,158
Come on.
Move.

1669
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:35,726
Reiss, come on.
Move.

1670
01:24:00,219 --> 01:24:03,720
<i>And Randy lifts Reiss up
as if he was a bag of feathers.</i>

1671
01:24:03,722 --> 01:24:05,189
Look at the power of Randy!

1672
01:24:11,197 --> 01:24:13,697
He's beating him
into submission.

1673
01:24:13,699 --> 01:24:16,200
<i>This is that famous
mean streak that he was known</i>

1674
01:24:16,202 --> 01:24:18,035
<i>for in the world of wrestling.</i>

1675
01:24:18,037 --> 01:24:22,639
Get out of this, Reiss.
Reiss, get out of it. Reiss, get out of it.

1676
01:24:22,641 --> 01:24:27,144
Get off the cage!
Get off the cage!

1677
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:29,146
<i>He's throwing elbows.
He's throwing punches and knees.</i>

1678
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:35,085
<i>And Randy has just
headbutted Reiss.</i>

1679
01:24:35,087 --> 01:24:37,154
<i>Oh, that is so disappointing.</i>

1680
01:24:37,156 --> 01:24:38,989
<i>It looks like
he just got a little</i>

1681
01:24:38,991 --> 01:24:41,325
<i>too overzealous in there with all
the adrenaline and excitement.</i>

1682
01:24:41,327 --> 01:24:42,726
Have some class.

1683
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:49,166
<i>He will definitely get
a point deducted for that.</i>

1684
01:24:49,168 --> 01:24:50,400
<i>As he should, Jimmy.</i>

1685
01:25:02,515 --> 01:25:05,782
<i>And the doctor has come
in to inspect Reiss's eye.</i>

1686
01:25:05,784 --> 01:25:09,186
<i>It does not look good.</i>

1687
01:25:09,188 --> 01:25:10,854
You can see
I'm fighting.

1688
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:12,789
- Straight ahead.
- I'm fighting.

1689
01:25:12,791 --> 01:25:14,525
I can fight.
Okay.

1690
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:16,026
I don't know if you can continue.
I can.

1691
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:17,961
I don't know...
I can.

1692
01:25:17,963 --> 01:25:20,297
Your left eye is
nearly completely shut.

1693
01:25:20,299 --> 01:25:22,866
I can see.
This is not looking good.

1694
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:27,871
Okay, how many fingers?

1695
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:29,873
Three.
Yeah, see, you hesitated.

1696
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:31,542
No, I'm fine.
Please, please.

1697
01:25:31,544 --> 01:25:33,710
Please, I can continue.

1698
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:35,279
- I really don't know.
- Please.

1699
01:25:35,281 --> 01:25:36,713
Please.

1700
01:25:36,715 --> 01:25:40,150
Yeah, yeah.
I'm okay.

1701
01:25:40,152 --> 01:25:42,052
Don't stop it.
I can fight.

1702
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:44,321
Ref. REISS: Please,
I'm begging you.

1703
01:25:44,323 --> 01:25:45,789
Let me continue.

1704
01:25:45,791 --> 01:25:48,725
I can.

1705
01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:49,793
Okay.

1706
01:25:53,165 --> 01:25:55,165
<i>Well, they're
letting him fight.</i>

1707
01:25:55,167 --> 01:25:56,833
<i>This is a
little surprising.</i>

1708
01:25:56,835 --> 01:25:59,469
<i>I know Reiss has a huge heart,
but I've never seen an eye</i>

1709
01:25:59,471 --> 01:26:01,071
<i>that badly swollen.</i>

1710
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:03,240
<i>Surely his vision is going
to be impaired right now.</i>

1711
01:26:03,242 --> 01:26:04,741
<i>Reiss looks
out of breath.</i>

1712
01:26:04,743 --> 01:26:06,076
<i>I'm sure
he'll struggle to see.</i>

1713
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:07,911
<i>I'm assuming the
doctors and the ref</i>

1714
01:26:07,913 --> 01:26:09,413
<i>will be keeping a
close eye on him</i>

1715
01:26:09,415 --> 01:26:11,481
<i>as he goes to continue
into the round.</i>

1716
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:20,857
Come on, bitch.
You motherfucker.

1717
01:26:20,859 --> 01:26:23,260
Cover!
Cover up!

1718
01:26:23,262 --> 01:26:24,828
<i>And Randy comes
out with heavy hands.</i>

1719
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:26,597
<i>He wants to end this fight.</i>

1720
01:26:26,599 --> 01:26:30,500
<i>Reiss is sitting there
like a punching bag right now.</i>

1721
01:26:30,502 --> 01:26:33,203
<i>Reiss is holding
on for dear life.</i>

1722
01:26:33,205 --> 01:26:34,504
Come on.

1723
01:26:34,506 --> 01:26:35,839
<i>He's got him
against the cage,</i>

1724
01:26:35,841 --> 01:26:37,274
<i>and he's hitting
him over and over.</i>

1725
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:40,611
<i>I have never seen one
man take such a beating.</i>

1726
01:26:40,613 --> 01:26:42,946
<i>Randy is just so
mean with his strikes.</i>

1727
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:44,615
<i>And the horn.</i>

1728
01:26:44,617 --> 01:26:46,516
<i>What a fight, Jimmy.</i>

1729
01:26:46,518 --> 01:26:48,552
<i>What a fight.</i>

1730
01:26:48,554 --> 01:26:50,721
I need a finish.
His groin is ripped.

1731
01:26:50,723 --> 01:26:52,389
His eye is blind.

1732
01:26:52,391 --> 01:26:53,790
Take him down.
Finish him.

1733
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:54,958
Count him out.

1734
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,793
It's time to
send this guy home.

1735
01:26:56,795 --> 01:26:58,295
I'm gonna take his head off.

1736
01:26:58,297 --> 01:27:00,897
I'm still not free of him.

1737
01:27:00,899 --> 01:27:02,065
We're gonna have
to stop it, bro.

1738
01:27:02,067 --> 01:27:04,034
No.
No, don't stop it, man.

1739
01:27:04,036 --> 01:27:06,803
I can't put you
out there blind.

1740
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:09,806
You got nothing left to prove.

1741
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:11,208
Please.

1742
01:27:22,254 --> 01:27:23,820
Yeah?
All right.

1743
01:27:23,822 --> 01:27:25,989
All right.
All right.

1744
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:28,058
He's the one in the
middle, all right?

1745
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:36,667
<i>Third round.</i>

1746
01:27:36,669 --> 01:27:41,004
<i>And this is shaping up to be
the fight of the century, easily</i>

1747
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:44,675
<i>the most exciting fight to have
ever taken place in the Legends</i>

1748
01:27:44,677 --> 01:27:47,277
<i>cage with two of
its biggest stars,</i>

1749
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:49,780
<i>Reiss Gibbons and Randy Stone.</i>

1750
01:27:49,782 --> 01:27:51,181
<i>I can
guarantee you this.</i>

1751
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:53,517
<i>No matter how this fight
goes, these two men</i>

1752
01:27:53,519 --> 01:27:55,485
<i>will never be the same.</i>

1753
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:22,446
Show me something, Reiss.

1754
01:28:22,448 --> 01:28:24,548
Come on.
You gotta move, Reiss.

1755
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:27,050
Get out of there.
Trip him up.

1756
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:30,053
<i>Look at the blood
on both their faces.</i>

1757
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:31,788
<i>Randy is
taunting Reiss in there,</i>

1758
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:33,657
<i>bouncing around, using feints.</i>

1759
01:28:33,659 --> 01:28:36,059
<i>He knows that Reiss's vision
is bound to be affected.</i>

1760
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:46,970
You got this, Reiss.

1761
01:28:46,972 --> 01:28:48,405
Send him home.

1762
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:50,173
<i>Reiss is just
flailing, throwing</i>

1763
01:28:50,175 --> 01:28:53,243
<i>his arms up with little
success, just grabbing air.</i>

1764
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:54,511
<i>This is
just getting messy.</i>

1765
01:28:54,513 --> 01:28:56,847
<i>Reiss looks like
he's out on his feet.</i>

1766
01:28:56,849 --> 01:28:58,849
<i>It's clear he
can't see in there.</i>

1767
01:28:58,851 --> 01:29:00,484
<i>They need to stop this fight.</i>

1768
01:29:00,486 --> 01:29:04,821
If you don't show me something,
I gotta throw in the towel.

1769
01:29:04,823 --> 01:29:07,224
<i>Amazing how Reiss
is still hanging on.</i>

1770
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:13,764
<i>It looks like Reiss
is trying to draw him in.</i>

1771
01:29:13,766 --> 01:29:15,699
<i>Reiss has just locked
in a guillotine choke.</i>

1772
01:29:15,701 --> 01:29:17,200
<i>It looks tight, Bobby.</i>

1773
01:29:17,202 --> 01:29:18,869
Get him, Reiss.

1774
01:29:18,871 --> 01:29:20,670
<i>Randy's trying to get
out, but it's really tight.</i>

1775
01:29:20,672 --> 01:29:22,873
Come on, Randy.
Let's go. Let's go.

1776
01:29:22,875 --> 01:29:24,274
Work the head.

1777
01:29:24,276 --> 01:29:25,842
<i>Danny Thicket is
shouting instructions.</i>

1778
01:29:25,844 --> 01:29:29,112
<i>He's trying to get out, but
Reiss is locking him in.</i>

1779
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:31,214
<i>This is the
first time we have ever</i>

1780
01:29:31,216 --> 01:29:33,550
<i>seen Randy Stone in trouble.</i>

1781
01:29:33,552 --> 01:29:36,186
<i>And Randy lifts Reiss
up and above his head.</i>

1782
01:29:36,188 --> 01:29:39,523
<i>Just look at the power!</i>

1783
01:29:39,525 --> 01:29:42,559
<i>What Randy Stone
needs to do is put Reiss down</i>

1784
01:29:42,561 --> 01:29:46,730
<i>and then roll out in order
to get out of this position.</i>

1785
01:29:46,732 --> 01:29:48,465
There you go, Reiss.

1786
01:29:48,467 --> 01:29:49,900
<i>Randy rolls out.</i>

1787
01:29:49,902 --> 01:29:51,134
<i>But Reiss transitions
to a rear naked choke.</i>

1788
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:53,470
That's it.
He's got it locked in.

1789
01:29:54,873 --> 01:29:56,973
<i>And Reiss is
squeezing for dear life.</i>

1790
01:30:02,815 --> 01:30:04,815
Come on!

1791
01:30:04,817 --> 01:30:07,384
You gotta tap!
Hold him tight. Come on.

1792
01:30:07,386 --> 01:30:08,752
Squeeze harder.

1793
01:30:17,396 --> 01:30:18,895
Some room!
Make some room, Randy.

1794
01:30:18,897 --> 01:30:20,664
Come on.
You can do this!

1795
01:30:20,666 --> 01:30:23,667
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1796
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:25,602
Don't tap out, Randy.

1797
01:30:32,578 --> 01:30:35,612
<i>Reiss is squeezing,
and Randy Stone is really</i>

1798
01:30:35,614 --> 01:30:37,247
<i>struggling to fight the hands.</i>

1799
01:30:42,521 --> 01:30:44,621
<i>He's going.
He's out. He's out.</i>

1800
01:30:44,623 --> 01:30:45,755
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

1801
01:30:45,757 --> 01:30:47,123
Yes!

1802
01:30:47,125 --> 01:30:49,693
<i>What you have
just seen is greatness,</i>

1803
01:30:49,695 --> 01:30:52,762
<i>and his name is Reiss Gibbons.</i>

1804
01:30:52,764 --> 01:30:55,365
Reiss has come back to
win the heavyweight title!

1805
01:30:55,367 --> 01:30:57,200
Unbelievable, Bobby!
Of Legends!

1806
01:30:57,202 --> 01:30:58,468
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

1807
01:30:58,470 --> 01:31:00,136
<i>It's never
been done before.</i>

1808
01:31:00,138 --> 01:31:03,206
<i>This is the most amazing fight
in the history of Legends,</i>

1809
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:06,276
<i>probably in the history
of Mixed Martial Arts.</i>

1810
01:31:06,278 --> 01:31:08,211
<i>Coming back from the
depths of despair,</i>

1811
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:10,547
<i>from two devastating
losses in a row,</i>

1812
01:31:10,549 --> 01:31:13,216
<i>coming back from retirement,
coming back from the lowest</i>

1813
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:16,820
<i>point in his career to rise up
and claim the most prestigious</i>

1814
01:31:16,822 --> 01:31:20,156
<i>prize in our sport against
arguably the toughest</i>

1815
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:22,325
<i>man on this planet.</i>

1816
01:31:22,327 --> 01:31:23,827
<i>It's a fairy tale, Jimmy.</i>

1817
01:31:23,829 --> 01:31:26,062
<i>I cannot believe
what I've just seen.</i>

1818
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:27,898
You did it!

1819
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,232
I'm so proud of you.

1820
01:31:29,234 --> 01:31:30,567
I'm so proud of you, brother.

1821
01:31:30,569 --> 01:31:32,235
<i>Congratulations,
Reiss Gibbons.</i>

1822
01:31:32,237 --> 01:31:34,804
<i>It's been a pleasure and an
honor to call your fight.</i>

1823
01:31:34,806 --> 01:31:39,643
Ladies and
gentlemen, our referee

1824
01:31:39,645 --> 01:31:43,413
TJ Steele has stopped this
fight in the third round,

1825
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:48,251
declaring the winner by rear
naked choke, your winner

1826
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:55,325
and new Heavyweight Legends
Champion of the World, the one,

1827
01:31:55,327 --> 01:32:02,098
the only, Reiss Gibbons!

1828
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:16,947
I thought you were
going to give up.

1829
01:32:16,949 --> 01:32:18,381
Not this time.

1830
01:32:18,383 --> 01:32:21,017
You're a tough son
of a bitch after all.

1831
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:28,625
You owe me a
rematch and a drink.

1832
01:32:28,627 --> 01:32:31,728
I made your ass famous.

1833
01:32:31,730 --> 01:32:33,563
All right.
Let's do it.

1834
01:32:33,565 --> 01:32:35,465
Make it two drinks.

1835
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:36,800
I've got you.

1836
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:38,234
Three drinks.

1837
01:32:38,236 --> 01:32:41,538
All right.

1838
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:44,474
Marcus, that's a hell of a fighter
you built. No quit in that boy.

1839
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:47,477
Congratulations.
Thank you, man.

1840
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:49,145
Your boy is good.
Thank you.

1841
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:51,414
We have work to do.

1842
01:33:29,121 --> 01:33:30,420
<i>Thank you.</i>

1843
01:33:30,422 --> 01:33:32,088
The biggest... The
biggest event ever.

1844
01:33:32,090 --> 01:33:33,289
I mean, the live
gate was ridiculous.

1845
01:33:33,291 --> 01:33:34,691
Over 30,000 people.

1846
01:33:34,693 --> 01:33:36,359
We had to turn people away.

1847
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:38,094
Pay-per-view is out of this...

1848
01:33:38,096 --> 01:33:39,295
I mean, it's off the charts.

1849
01:33:39,297 --> 01:33:41,097
It's off the charts.

1850
01:33:41,099 --> 01:33:42,532
I mean, this was the most exciting
fight I've ever seen in my life.

1851
01:33:42,534 --> 01:33:44,200
The fans were going crazy.

1852
01:33:44,202 --> 01:33:46,136
I mean, it didn't look so
good for Reiss for a while,

1853
01:33:46,138 --> 01:33:48,204
but, I mean, you
gotta hand it to him.

1854
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:49,372
He's a champ.

1855
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:52,809
That guy is a
champ, coming back.

1856
01:33:52,811 --> 01:33:54,110
Oh, the eye is going to
be fine.

1857
01:33:54,112 --> 01:33:55,478
I mean, yeah, it's bad.

1858
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,280
Did you see the fight?
The fight was insane.

1859
01:33:57,282 --> 01:33:59,549
But you know, Reiss...

1860
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:02,619
I have to say, Reiss bounces
back like nobody you've

1861
01:34:02,621 --> 01:34:04,721
ever seen in this business.

1862
01:34:04,723 --> 01:34:06,156
I mean, he'll probably
end up getting,

1863
01:34:06,158 --> 01:34:09,392
you know, eye patch
sponsors from this thing.

1864
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:10,560
That's all we know.

1865
01:34:10,562 --> 01:34:12,062
Don't worry about Reiss.

1866
01:34:12,064 --> 01:34:13,797
He's a six-time
champ now, right?

1867
01:34:13,799 --> 01:34:15,165
I mean, he's our guy.

1868
01:34:15,167 --> 01:34:17,567
We started Legends with him.

1869
01:34:17,569 --> 01:34:19,235
I'm so proud of him.

1870
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:20,737
I was nervous.

1871
01:34:20,739 --> 01:34:23,973
I'll be honest, I was
nervous for a little bit.

1872
01:34:23,975 --> 01:34:25,341
It wasn't looking good.

1873
01:34:25,343 --> 01:34:27,477
But, you know, Reiss
has got so much heart.

1874
01:34:27,479 --> 01:34:30,647
And he's a beautiful spirit.

1875
01:34:30,649 --> 01:34:32,582
He's the sort of fighter...
He loves to fight,

1876
01:34:32,584 --> 01:34:34,250
but of all a
sudden, you know, he

1877
01:34:34,252 --> 01:34:36,086
could turn around and go become
a professor or something.

1878
01:34:36,088 --> 01:34:39,255
I don't know.
He could do something else.

1879
01:34:39,257 --> 01:34:41,024
I mean, the one who's
off the chart is Randy.

1880
01:34:41,026 --> 01:34:42,759
I mean, that guy...

1881
01:34:42,761 --> 01:34:44,527
I mean, that guy is
in an animal, right?

1882
01:34:44,529 --> 01:34:46,096
I mean, he could do no wrong.

1883
01:34:46,098 --> 01:34:49,099
You have no idea the
sponsors this guy is getting.

1884
01:34:49,101 --> 01:34:50,667
I mean, we're
talking book deals.

1885
01:34:50,669 --> 01:34:51,935
We're talking
restaurant deals.

1886
01:34:51,937 --> 01:34:53,603
We're talking
speaking engagements.

1887
01:34:53,605 --> 01:34:55,505
I mean, he's now the star...

1888
01:34:55,507 --> 01:34:56,673
We just found out tonight.

1889
01:34:56,675 --> 01:34:58,608
Am I allowed to say?
All right.

1890
01:34:58,610 --> 01:34:59,876
I'm allowed to say this.

1891
01:34:59,878 --> 01:35:01,611
He's gonna be the
new Ax Man, right?

1892
01:35:01,613 --> 01:35:04,280
From the guys who brought
you the <i>Chainsaw</i> trilogy,

1893
01:35:04,282 --> 01:35:06,716
he's the new
Ax Man coming out.

1894
01:35:06,718 --> 01:35:08,118
Amazing.

1895
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:11,187
He's opening up... He
just got this gig today.

1896
01:35:11,189 --> 01:35:12,455
I mean, it doesn't matter.

1897
01:35:12,457 --> 01:35:14,124
It doesn't matter
if this guy loses.

1898
01:35:14,126 --> 01:35:17,193
He's now going to
be the spokesman

1899
01:35:17,195 --> 01:35:19,129
of the Cult of Raw Aggression.

1900
01:35:19,131 --> 01:35:20,697
I don't know if
you've heard about it.

1901
01:35:20,699 --> 01:35:23,399
It's this big... You know,
big motivational speaker.

1902
01:35:23,401 --> 01:35:25,135
And now we're going to
tie it...

1903
01:35:25,137 --> 01:35:28,738
Legends, we're going to tie this
into his new restaurant, Raw.

1904
01:35:28,740 --> 01:35:30,740
You know, I think before
when he was a pro wrestler,

1905
01:35:30,742 --> 01:35:35,912
he had that restaurant, Meat,
when he was a huge meat eater,

1906
01:35:35,914 --> 01:35:38,982
and it was raw meat,
any kind of meat.

1907
01:35:38,984 --> 01:35:40,316
But now I don't know.

1908
01:35:40,318 --> 01:35:43,653
He's got this new
whole thing going on.

1909
01:35:43,655 --> 01:35:45,321
He's gone vegan,
and that's where

1910
01:35:45,323 --> 01:35:46,723
he says a lot of
his stuff's coming...

1911
01:35:46,725 --> 01:35:50,827
So now Raw is featuring,
like, vegan sausages

1912
01:35:50,829 --> 01:35:53,263
and anything raw.
And he gets his power.

1913
01:35:53,265 --> 01:35:54,764
So we're going to tie that
in the Raw Aggression

1914
01:35:54,766 --> 01:35:56,766
into the Raw restaurants,
the Legends thing.

1915
01:35:56,768 --> 01:35:57,901
We're packaging it.

1916
01:35:57,903 --> 01:35:59,068
You can get it in the stores.

1917
01:35:59,070 --> 01:36:00,503
You can get it anywhere.

1918
01:36:00,505 --> 01:36:01,905
It's pretty awesome.

1919
01:36:01,907 --> 01:36:04,174
And what it
specializes in beets...

1920
01:36:04,176 --> 01:36:06,342
Like, beet juice,
so you could eat it,

1921
01:36:06,344 --> 01:36:07,577
and it looks like blood.

1922
01:36:07,579 --> 01:36:09,779
And Randy sells
the shit out of it.

1923
01:36:09,781 --> 01:36:11,281
Oh, man.

1924
01:36:11,283 --> 01:36:14,784
He's got everything...
Diapers, diaper sponsors.

1925
01:36:14,786 --> 01:36:16,619
You know, you can
never be too strong.

1926
01:36:16,621 --> 01:36:18,188
People love this guy.

1927
01:36:18,190 --> 01:36:19,589
It doesn't matter if he wins or loses.
He's an animal.

1928
01:36:19,591 --> 01:36:21,291
They love him.
Oh, yeah.

1929
01:36:21,293 --> 01:36:23,960
I mean, of all people,
Randy...

1930
01:36:23,962 --> 01:36:25,195
I mean, listen.

1931
01:36:25,197 --> 01:36:28,431
He just got this
huge book deal also.

1932
01:36:28,433 --> 01:36:30,300
It's going to be a big thing.

1933
01:36:30,302 --> 01:36:31,868
It's those
motivational things.

1934
01:36:31,870 --> 01:36:34,370
He's really big on that
chain, but he's wrestling

1935
01:36:34,372 --> 01:36:35,872
with your inner aggro.

1936
01:36:35,874 --> 01:36:37,774
He talks, and people
write it down.

1937
01:36:37,776 --> 01:36:40,710
He's got pictures.
I mean, he's a lot different.

1938
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:43,313
He's kind of a
sensitive guy, really.

1939
01:36:43,315 --> 01:36:44,814
I mean, you would
never believe it,

1940
01:36:44,816 --> 01:36:47,984
but I think the whole raw
thing has shifted him.

1941
01:37:59,632 --> 01:38:01,546
