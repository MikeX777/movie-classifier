1
00:01:25,175 --> 00:01:26,356
Wrong!

2
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:29,179
I didn't get it wrong, she did.

3
00:01:30,308 --> 00:01:32,058
Dad, it's your song!

4
00:01:32,183 --> 00:01:35,284
I ought to tell them
that I hate this song.

5
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:36,358
Drink, sir?

6
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:39,659
I'd like a small vodka
with a few almonds.

7
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,346
The same for my wife.

8
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:44,534
Heaven forbid, no.
Apricot juice for me.

9
00:01:44,558 --> 00:01:46,177
And you, stop drinking.

10
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:49,409
- I can hardly refuse!
- It'll make you ill.

11
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:51,315
Poor girl is crazy about me.

12
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:53,623
Quit acting like Clark Gable!

13
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:57,104
Come on, have a drink with me.
Just one.

14
00:01:57,725 --> 00:01:59,694
For once in your life.

15
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:01,080
I don't like the taste.

16
00:02:01,183 --> 00:02:03,677
But you love me, so...

17
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,467
Stop playacting!

18
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,006
<i>Happy birthday to Philippe
and a great big Mazel Tov!</i>

19
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,556
Until your 120th, Dad!

20
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:38,779
Let's dance.

21
00:02:43,558 --> 00:02:46,659
<i>Et pour Philippe
Chantons tous Mazel Tov.</i>

22
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:49,784
<i>Pour la famille
Chantons tous Siman Tov.</i>

23
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:52,784
<i>Pour les amis
Chantons tous Mazel Tov.</i>

24
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:56,221
<i>Chantons Shalom Shalom Mazel Tov.</i>

25
00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:21,177
Where's my wife?

26
00:03:21,308 --> 00:03:22,883
She's coming, Dad!

27
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,143
Rose?

28
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:12,383
Can't catch me!

29
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:14,006
I'm it!

30
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:32,815
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, great.

31
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:36,164
What were you saying to Dad?

32
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:37,669
Nothing, why?

33
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,560
Did you get the MRI results?

34
00:04:47,683 --> 00:04:49,521
He'll be OK, won't he?

35
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,271
He'll come to my unit at the hospital.

36
00:04:57,058 --> 00:05:01,215
He told me not to tell Mom.
He wants a nice party.

37
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:22,658
All good?

38
00:05:28,808 --> 00:05:30,558
I want a drink.

39
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:33,308
Did you leave Léon cash
for the valet parking?

40
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,100
Of course, don't worry.

41
00:05:36,392 --> 00:05:38,492
You didn't say goodbye to anyone.

42
00:05:38,558 --> 00:05:40,002
You know the difference

43
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,076
between leaving the English way
and leaving the Tunisian way?

44
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,993
The English way,
you say goodbye to no one and go.

45
00:05:48,017 --> 00:05:52,118
The Tunisian way,
you say goodbye to everyone and stay.

46
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:54,505
I'm very English, you know!

47
00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:56,573
Leaving already?

48
00:05:56,683 --> 00:05:58,127
Shh, not a word!

49
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,150
So when are we having dinner?

50
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:04,784
Well, how about next week?
Then we've got rid of it.

51
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:06,514
You're such a <i>rkik!</i>

52
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Bye!

53
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:24,993
What about Joli Coeur on Saturday?
Do we go win or place?

54
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,729
Joli Coeur has its work cut out.

55
00:06:28,017 --> 00:06:30,423
It's up against River Moon.

56
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,400
I prefer to go one in nine.

57
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:36,323
I can bet less and it still wins more
than one in three.

58
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,050
Can't wait for you to find
the winning combination

59
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,893
and leave home!

60
00:06:41,308 --> 00:06:43,627
I won't be on your back for much longer.

61
00:06:44,683 --> 00:06:47,308
I'll either be in jail or in Thailand.

62
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,193
You watch too many movies.

63
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:55,123
Stop fretting, son.
Nothing's going to happen.

64
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,868
Let me help, Mom.

65
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:43,993
There.

66
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:48,329
Get that, Léon, it's your brother!

67
00:08:57,142 --> 00:08:58,192
Go on in.

68
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:19,130
Mind the glass.

69
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:21,725
Will you help me?

70
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:28,677
- Need a hand, doctor?
- No, thanks.

71
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,762
Right, push...

72
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,944
Got it.

73
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:03,539
Want some?
Shall I leave it here?

74
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:10,892
Hello, Auntie.

75
00:10:11,017 --> 00:10:13,029
What's happening to us?

76
00:10:15,225 --> 00:10:16,231
Thanks.

77
00:10:17,142 --> 00:10:19,329
I'll leave you. Go on in.

78
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:31,935
Pierre, it's the Rabbi.

79
00:10:32,017 --> 00:10:33,241
No, I'm Dan.

80
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,975
Dan is Dad's cousin's son.
Hi.

81
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:38,025
Thank you.

82
00:10:38,142 --> 00:10:40,023
- Sorry! Hello.
- It's fine.

83
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,156
Yeah, well, it's hard to tell.

84
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,800
Hard to tell what?

85
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:50,764
A case like yours
can always be defended.

86
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:56,480
They taste excellent!

87
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:58,771
But you have to open them.

88
00:10:59,683 --> 00:11:01,740
Remember that in life,

89
00:11:01,808 --> 00:11:04,871
there's no pleasure
without a little work.

90
00:11:05,904 --> 00:11:06,904
More!

91
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:10,858
I use the freezer, I don't like cooking.

92
00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:13,371
What do I do with this, Mom?

93
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:20,176
Do we need more coffee?

94
00:11:20,258 --> 00:11:21,258
Yes.

95
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:23,202
Are you OK, Mom?

96
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Of course.

97
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:27,475
Of course.

98
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:54,768
You haven't changed,
you were always beautiful.

99
00:11:55,092 --> 00:11:56,841
It's good of you to come.

100
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,369
Of course I came, Rose.

101
00:11:59,508 --> 00:12:01,565
I'm going, but call me anytime.

102
00:12:01,675 --> 00:12:04,734
All right?
Don't worry about Léon, he'll be fine.

103
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:06,640
- Sure?
- He won't go to jail,

104
00:12:06,758 --> 00:12:09,996
he has no past history.
Shall I call my colleague?

105
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,938
If you don't mind.
It's so nice of you.

106
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:13,967
I will.

107
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:15,181
OK.

108
00:12:15,592 --> 00:12:17,079
See you soon.

109
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:25,567
It's good to see you.

110
00:12:25,883 --> 00:12:27,633
It's been, what, 20 years?

111
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:34,162
Tsilla, Sophie was just leaving, so...

112
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,863
Nice to have met you.

113
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:39,146
Likewise.

114
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,506
I'll call your mother about Léon.

115
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:43,385
Thanks very much.

116
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:47,691
You ski?

117
00:12:48,842 --> 00:12:50,548
A Levy that skis?!

118
00:12:52,383 --> 00:12:54,834
A Levy from Batna who skis?

119
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,169
I'm a man of many talents.

120
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,406
My husband may be boring
but at least he's here.

121
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:02,942
But how will you cope, my dear?

122
00:13:03,008 --> 00:13:04,496
Do you want a fritter?

123
00:13:04,592 --> 00:13:06,517
I'm on a gluten-free diet.

124
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:09,565
Hey, Jojo,
yours is more gluten fry-up, right?

125
00:13:14,258 --> 00:13:16,227
What was that?
What's so funny?

126
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,182
Gluten fry-up, he said.

127
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:20,473
At least you have children!

128
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,869
Pierre... I wanted to ask you...

129
00:13:33,217 --> 00:13:36,935
He died on a Friday,
shouldn't we kill an animal?

130
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,484
No, Mom.
That's not religion, just bullshit

131
00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:42,646
and superstition.

132
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:45,252
Sure?
I don't want it to bring bad luck.

133
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,925
No, Mom, don't worry.

134
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:49,760
Poor Philippe!

135
00:13:50,342 --> 00:13:52,223
It's fine... Who's that?

136
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:56,988
Who's she?

137
00:13:57,092 --> 00:13:58,273
I don't know.

138
00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:01,688
Jojo, do you know her?

139
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,498
It's the <i>rkika,</i>
she just loves attending funerals.

140
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:11,615
I'm tired.

141
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:15,758
- I ought to sleep.
<i>- Waliya.</i>

142
00:14:27,342 --> 00:14:28,742
I'll fetch Mom.

143
00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:32,419
She said she didn't want to talk to him.

144
00:14:39,842 --> 00:14:41,985
I'll be here with you all week.

145
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:48,151
Tsilla and I were thinking she could
come to the house, after Shiv'ah.

146
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:50,887
I live here, I could take care of her.

147
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:58,400
We can't move her out,
she's spent her life here.

148
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:03,942
Our room was small, wasn't it?

149
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:05,583
You were small!

150
00:15:31,383 --> 00:15:32,696
Come in.

151
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Thanks.

152
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,850
Shit, it's good to see you.

153
00:15:39,883 --> 00:15:40,890
Same here.

154
00:15:41,883 --> 00:15:43,940
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

155
00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:55,079
You got here late.

156
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:56,646
I'm here now.

157
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:04,996
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, honey.

158
00:16:05,092 --> 00:16:07,061
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, you?

159
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,050
Fine.

160
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,538
Sorry, I can't stay.

161
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:12,123
Here, I brought your bag.

162
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,714
Well, I'll get back to Mom.

163
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,850
All right.

164
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,450
- Is Grandma OK?
- She's good.

165
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,608
I'll get going.

166
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:26,956
I'll come down with you.

167
00:16:27,092 --> 00:16:28,405
OK, I'll wait.

168
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:30,302
I'll take the children home.

169
00:16:30,383 --> 00:16:32,746
See you tomorrow for the funeral.

170
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:35,383
Where are the soft toys?

171
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:37,479
They should be in their bags.

172
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,212
I'll fetch the kids.

173
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,306
I love you.

174
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:41,896
I love you too.

175
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,437
Thank you.

176
00:16:46,008 --> 00:16:47,058
Guys?

177
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:55,443
What are you doing?

178
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,994
Playing at being Granddad.

179
00:16:57,092 --> 00:16:58,710
My turn.

180
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:38,973
Forgive me, it's all I have.

181
00:18:40,133 --> 00:18:41,752
But I beg You...

182
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,806
protect my son, don't harm my Léon.

183
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:53,905
Aren't you asleep?

184
00:19:54,008 --> 00:19:56,108
You're sacrificing frozen meat?

185
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:58,450
Please, stop worrying.

186
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,526
You know it wasn't me.
I didn't kill anyone, or sell any drugs.

187
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,475
But you sold stolen goods.

188
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:08,484
Sophie said I won't go to jail.
I'm not a crook!

189
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:10,083
I'm not saying anything.

190
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:14,151
Now hurry up,
the traffic to the cemetery is bad.

191
00:20:14,175 --> 00:20:16,931
We need to wake people up,
we mustn't be late.

192
00:20:22,633 --> 00:20:25,171
Jews in mourning have a strange custom.

193
00:20:25,217 --> 00:20:27,842
The rending of a garment.

194
00:20:28,883 --> 00:20:31,683
The torn piece of clothing is saying

195
00:20:31,717 --> 00:20:34,734
something that words cannot express.

196
00:20:34,758 --> 00:20:37,865
Not in any language.

197
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:43,134
It means you need to learn
to live with rending.

198
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:51,417
<i>Amen.</i>

199
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,850
<i>Hello, you've reached Philippe</i>

200
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:52,587
<i>and Rose Goldberg.</i>

201
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:55,125
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

202
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:57,302
<i>Mom? Can you pick up?</i>

203
00:22:58,467 --> 00:22:59,867
<i>You still won't?</i>

204
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:02,285
<i>I'm running 15 minutes late.</i>

205
00:23:02,342 --> 00:23:03,786
<i>Can you come down?</i>

206
00:23:50,008 --> 00:23:51,277
How was it, sir?

207
00:23:51,383 --> 00:23:52,521
Great, thanks.

208
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:05,523
Nice here, isn't it?

209
00:24:05,883 --> 00:24:08,984
It's right downstairs
yet you've never been here.

210
00:24:09,008 --> 00:24:10,409
Not even with Dad?

211
00:24:10,508 --> 00:24:11,602
Why bother?

212
00:24:15,425 --> 00:24:17,569
Have you chosen, ladies?

213
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:22,529
Dish of the day is salmon
with roast vegetables

214
00:24:22,592 --> 00:24:24,254
or mashed potatoes.

215
00:24:24,342 --> 00:24:26,660
I'll have that, with the vegetables.

216
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:31,494
Well, I like both...
I'll have the same as my daughter.

217
00:24:32,258 --> 00:24:33,439
Any drinks?

218
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,818
Water, please.

219
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,682
Why won't you answer the phone?

220
00:24:42,675 --> 00:24:43,769
I didn't hear it.

221
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:46,683
Didn't hear it?
I call 20 times a day.

222
00:24:47,467 --> 00:24:49,654
I'm sick of that answering machine.

223
00:24:49,758 --> 00:24:50,939
Well, I like it.

224
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,138
I can hear Dad's voice.

225
00:24:55,217 --> 00:24:58,236
I almost called him yesterday
for the meatball recipe.

226
00:25:00,058 --> 00:25:01,589
Your glasses need fixing.

227
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:03,126
I haven't had time.

228
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:06,655
I'll take you.

229
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:11,804
Tell me when you want help
emptying Dad's cupboards.

230
00:25:13,633 --> 00:25:15,252
Can I have bread, please?

231
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:22,984
Will you come to the bank with me?
To give you power of attorney.

232
00:25:23,008 --> 00:25:24,671
Oh no, for pity's sake!

233
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:26,552
What's wrong with you?

234
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,625
You're in good health.

235
00:25:29,717 --> 00:25:31,379
That can change quickly.

236
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,457
Supposing you have to look after me.

237
00:25:34,508 --> 00:25:36,171
Do it, for me.

238
00:25:36,258 --> 00:25:37,964
Mom, I'm a choreographer,

239
00:25:38,092 --> 00:25:40,410
not a notary. Ask Pierre.

240
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,769
And stop it, everything's fine.

241
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,216
Don't look at me like that.

242
00:25:55,758 --> 00:25:57,290
How's Annaëlle?

243
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:02,625
I'm hard on you. I'm sorry.

244
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:07,488
You know that deep down
I'm a good egg.

245
00:26:08,425 --> 00:26:09,475
Here we go.

246
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:13,321
I've added some potatoes.

247
00:26:13,425 --> 00:26:15,525
- That's nice of you.
<i>- Bon appétit.</i>

248
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,093
See? Things are changing.

249
00:26:19,883 --> 00:26:21,152
Yes...

250
00:26:22,425 --> 00:26:24,656
- Do you have bread?
- Just a little.

251
00:26:29,758 --> 00:26:31,902
Pierre, can you tell them to stop?

252
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:35,117
They're kids, leave them to it.
You tell them!

253
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:37,677
No, thanks, I value my life.

254
00:26:38,758 --> 00:26:42,818
Auntie loves it, crank it up, kids.
We can't hear!

255
00:26:42,842 --> 00:26:45,029
- You're so tedious!
- Oh, come on.

256
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:50,540
Thanks, Léon.
Wait till you have kids.

257
00:26:50,633 --> 00:26:51,902
Don't hold your breath.

258
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:55,880
What made you buy them one?
They cost a fortune.

259
00:26:56,508 --> 00:26:58,652
It's fun to see them have fun.

260
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,379
You play yourself?

261
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:01,517
Fuck you!

262
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:03,077
Léon, calm down.

263
00:27:03,175 --> 00:27:04,225
I'm tired.

264
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:07,256
That's enough, kids.

265
00:27:08,717 --> 00:27:10,292
Time to brush your teeth.

266
00:27:11,217 --> 00:27:12,530
I'll come with you.

267
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:19,321
Pierre says you're going to Israel?

268
00:27:19,383 --> 00:27:21,046
School trip, with my class.

269
00:27:22,383 --> 00:27:24,571
Hey, Mom's in a bad way.

270
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,050
I know.

271
00:27:26,092 --> 00:27:28,848
She stinks.
I mean, her hair...

272
00:27:28,883 --> 00:27:32,164
She hasn't washed in weeks,
I don't know what to do.

273
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:36,109
She didn't pay her electric bill,
they almost cut her off.

274
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:38,364
She says she's coping but she isn't.

275
00:27:38,425 --> 00:27:41,181
She can't manage,
Dad took care of everything.

276
00:27:41,217 --> 00:27:42,704
She refuses my help.

277
00:27:42,842 --> 00:27:46,342
Every day, Tsilla offers to pop in.
Every day she says no.

278
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:50,883
Maybe she should see a shrink.

279
00:27:51,008 --> 00:27:52,934
A shrink? No.

280
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:56,610
We'll hire a cleaner.

281
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:59,385
That's not the problem,
it's about self-care.

282
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:02,200
How about a fancy spa treatment?

283
00:28:02,258 --> 00:28:04,796
Mom can't bear to be touched.

284
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,290
I think it's a good idea,
I'll book one.

285
00:28:07,342 --> 00:28:09,836
- Go ahead.
- I will, I'll do what I like.

286
00:28:09,883 --> 00:28:10,977
Sure you will.

287
00:28:31,217 --> 00:28:33,273
<i>- Jean-Marie?
- Six letters.</i>

288
00:28:33,342 --> 00:28:34,479
It's me.

289
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,212
You're not wearing the dress?

290
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,575
It's too much,
I wasn't comfortable.

291
00:28:42,633 --> 00:28:43,683
You look lovely.

292
00:28:43,842 --> 00:28:46,336
What am I going to do
with all those youngsters?

293
00:28:46,383 --> 00:28:48,440
Put your shoes on, we're late.

294
00:28:48,508 --> 00:28:49,909
But my TV show...

295
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:51,407
I'll record it.

296
00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:52,909
Sure you know how?

297
00:28:57,092 --> 00:28:58,229
I'm not going.

298
00:28:59,217 --> 00:29:00,441
Hurry up.

299
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,331
I'm badly parked.

300
00:29:10,925 --> 00:29:12,544
- Come on.
- Well, help me!

301
00:29:15,508 --> 00:29:17,608
Here... Where are your shoes?

302
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,298
You're such a nuisance!

303
00:29:25,258 --> 00:29:26,439
Are you OK?

304
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,212
- Hi!
- Hello.

305
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,481
Sarah?
I'm Stéphane.

306
00:29:30,592 --> 00:29:32,430
Yes, I remember!

307
00:29:32,508 --> 00:29:34,390
- I know the code.
- Ah, good.

308
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,113
- That's it.
- Great.

309
00:29:37,217 --> 00:29:38,485
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

310
00:29:38,592 --> 00:29:39,729
After you.

311
00:29:41,633 --> 00:29:42,858
So cool to see you.

312
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:45,330
- This is my mom.
- How do you do?

313
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:51,310
It's crazy, you look totally different.

314
00:29:51,342 --> 00:29:53,705
You hate it, everyone does.

315
00:29:54,217 --> 00:29:57,192
Still, you never go home alone
with a blow-dry.

316
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,350
I'll bet!

317
00:29:58,508 --> 00:30:00,346
Tonight, I'll be with my mom.

318
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:05,408
Well, it's nice to meet you, Rose.

319
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:07,521
That's nice of you, thanks.

320
00:30:08,675 --> 00:30:11,825
By the way,
I spoke to Sophie on the phone.

321
00:30:11,883 --> 00:30:14,552
She's very upbeat about your brother.

322
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,781
Let's talk about that later.

323
00:30:17,842 --> 00:30:18,935
Yes, all right.

324
00:30:19,425 --> 00:30:20,475
Help yourself.

325
00:30:20,633 --> 00:30:21,814
Let me help.

326
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:23,150
No, stay there.

327
00:30:23,258 --> 00:30:24,308
But I'd like to.

328
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:25,431
Leave it to me.

329
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,606
Here, Mom, serve yourself.

330
00:30:28,758 --> 00:30:29,896
Peppers?

331
00:30:30,508 --> 00:30:32,127
Your mother's charming.

332
00:30:35,383 --> 00:30:36,608
Do you like it?

333
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,775
Tomatoes, Mom?

334
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:43,746
I keep inviting your daughter for dinner
but she's always too busy.

335
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:46,258
Maybe she doesn't like you.

336
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,081
That's not polite!

337
00:30:50,175 --> 00:30:51,225
Ah, I see.

338
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,114
- No, it's fine.
- I'm sorry.

339
00:30:54,217 --> 00:30:55,617
It put me in my place!

340
00:30:57,925 --> 00:30:59,325
Splendid!

341
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:00,867
Anyway I'm to be avoided.

342
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:05,011
Don't worry, I'm a lousy lay too.

343
00:31:08,508 --> 00:31:10,434
That's not what I meant!

344
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:13,830
Well, I'm starved, I'm going to eat.

345
00:31:13,925 --> 00:31:15,544
Rose, give me your plate.

346
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:17,867
How much do you want?

347
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:19,479
Are you very hungry?

348
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:21,019
So what do you do?

349
00:31:21,175 --> 00:31:22,925
I write comic strips.

350
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,644
Comic strips?

351
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,883
- Great.
- Yeah, it's cool.

352
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:28,848
So you write and draw?

353
00:31:31,883 --> 00:31:33,546
Pénélope does comic strips.

354
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:35,206
I know, I love her stuff.

355
00:31:35,342 --> 00:31:38,609
Amazing, he stages a character
who's a bit like him

356
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:43,276
and describes how he himself
lives only by love, like Don Juan.

357
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,093
Casanova keeps falling in love

358
00:31:45,175 --> 00:31:47,450
but Don Juan seeks pleasure.

359
00:31:47,508 --> 00:31:51,484
He's not sensual, he isn't a lover,
he's fascinated by desire.

360
00:31:51,508 --> 00:31:53,302
That's Babas!

361
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,588
He never commits, he ditched his girl.

362
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:57,946
But I'm sensual.

363
00:31:58,092 --> 00:31:59,492
Sensual!

364
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,581
Delicious, aren't they?

365
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:06,460
He's a lover!

366
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:09,818
Why create a dichotomy
between love and sensuality?

367
00:32:09,842 --> 00:32:14,068
All that to shoehorn "dichotomy"
into a sentence!

368
00:32:14,092 --> 00:32:16,235
Why not "corroborant"?

369
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,100
Next it'll be "antepenultimate"!

370
00:32:19,175 --> 00:32:21,800
- This pasta is amazing.
- Really good.

371
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,862
You could try peppermint.

372
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:28,693
Do you want a hand?

373
00:32:29,342 --> 00:32:32,054
Hold your plate level, that'll help.

374
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:33,958
Give it here!

375
00:32:35,258 --> 00:32:36,352
Can I eat now?

376
00:32:37,842 --> 00:32:39,985
I'm a circus ringmaster
at the moment

377
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:42,455
so I'm watching one circus film a day.

378
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:46,094
I've developed a passion for
circus movies, three of them.

379
00:32:49,758 --> 00:32:52,734
He's nice,
you should have dinner with him.

380
00:32:53,675 --> 00:32:54,675
Stop it.

381
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,663
There's an old Woody Allen movie.

382
00:32:58,467 --> 00:32:59,560
And Fellini.

383
00:32:59,675 --> 00:33:01,688
Well, Fellini's "Clowns"...

384
00:33:02,883 --> 00:33:04,152
Hi, everyone!

385
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,002
Hey, you're late!

386
00:33:07,133 --> 00:33:08,621
Oh, I'm sorry.

387
00:33:10,675 --> 00:33:12,032
Thank you very much.

388
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:13,446
See how young she is?

389
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:17,138
You all know our national treasure,
Marceline...

390
00:33:18,508 --> 00:33:20,434
Enough of your pompous style.

391
00:33:20,508 --> 00:33:21,646
Fetch me a vodka!

392
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,075
Iced... well iced!

393
00:33:25,092 --> 00:33:26,316
My dear!

394
00:33:27,008 --> 00:33:28,802
- You know Julie?
- No.

395
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:30,544
- Glad to know you.
- Likewise.

396
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,633
Delighted.

397
00:33:32,508 --> 00:33:33,558
Here, Marceline.

398
00:33:46,175 --> 00:33:49,063
Wait, I don't know you.

399
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:51,629
- No.
- We've never met.

400
00:33:51,675 --> 00:33:54,607
- What's your name?
- Rose Goldberg.

401
00:33:55,425 --> 00:33:57,131
And what do you do?

402
00:33:58,467 --> 00:33:59,911
I'm a widow.

403
00:34:02,758 --> 00:34:03,758
She's funny!

404
00:34:08,217 --> 00:34:09,748
Vodka, vodka!

405
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:21,193
You know... I just wanted to say,
your books changed my life.

406
00:34:21,217 --> 00:34:24,016
It sounds ridiculous but I'm pretty...

407
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:26,762
Enough of that, stop licking my boots.

408
00:34:26,842 --> 00:34:29,817
It's like being with old people.
Honestly!

409
00:34:31,092 --> 00:34:33,104
Look, he's twice your age.

410
00:34:33,175 --> 00:34:34,181
50-50.

411
00:34:34,717 --> 00:34:37,342
Roll me a joint, I can't see anything.

412
00:34:37,425 --> 00:34:38,431
Great.

413
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,225
Plus she's got all the gear.

414
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,113
One paper or two?

415
00:34:45,258 --> 00:34:46,265
Two!

416
00:34:48,342 --> 00:34:50,792
- You messed up.
- These guys are experts.

417
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:52,196
Which filter?

418
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:55,213
Moroccan or cardboard?

419
00:34:55,633 --> 00:34:58,521
Say, it's no laughing matter, Marceline.

420
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,606
No. It's good stuff.

421
00:35:01,008 --> 00:35:04,596
- You approve, Nicolas?
- Obviously an expert to my right.

422
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:08,276
I can't remember where it's from.
I have no idea.

423
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,050
Can you identify its origins?

424
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:11,663
I'm not used to it.

425
00:35:22,592 --> 00:35:24,735
People go,
and they leave it everywhere.

426
00:35:25,217 --> 00:35:26,223
Exactly.

427
00:35:26,675 --> 00:35:30,651
On the table corner...
They just leave it behind.

428
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:32,468
That's true, you know.

429
00:35:33,092 --> 00:35:36,592
Reggae and Judaism is a lot to cover
in one sentence!

430
00:35:40,133 --> 00:35:44,464
Dreadlocks are like Jewish payot.

431
00:35:44,967 --> 00:35:46,148
Yes, it's true.

432
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,093
They don't eat pork...

433
00:35:49,425 --> 00:35:51,919
Wait, we haven't served you.

434
00:35:51,967 --> 00:35:53,411
I'll take a little...

435
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,918
Burrata is Adèle's favorite,
she might not give you any.

436
00:36:03,508 --> 00:36:05,434
Hey, why aren't you in bed?

437
00:36:06,217 --> 00:36:07,966
We just wanted a pee.

438
00:36:08,092 --> 00:36:09,930
Sure you did. Get to bed!

439
00:36:10,008 --> 00:36:11,365
All right then.

440
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:17,185
Cheeky!

441
00:36:18,967 --> 00:36:20,104
Honestly!

442
00:36:20,508 --> 00:36:21,909
Let her stay.

443
00:36:22,008 --> 00:36:23,189
No, it's late.

444
00:36:23,342 --> 00:36:26,929
I need to get her up and off to school
in the morning.

445
00:36:27,342 --> 00:36:28,698
You try it!

446
00:36:29,633 --> 00:36:31,559
They're just trying it on.

447
00:36:38,592 --> 00:36:39,592
Thanks.

448
00:36:42,675 --> 00:36:44,119
Isn't it dangerous?

449
00:36:44,217 --> 00:36:45,354
Not at all.

450
00:36:46,508 --> 00:36:48,040
Care to try?

451
00:36:51,508 --> 00:36:53,434
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

452
00:37:01,383 --> 00:37:03,702
Sorry, but she asked.

453
00:37:09,592 --> 00:37:10,816
I'm so sorry.

454
00:37:10,925 --> 00:37:12,019
Sorry, she asked!

455
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:15,496
I'm going to get the blame.

456
00:37:17,842 --> 00:37:19,023
Are you OK?

457
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,525
I think so.

458
00:37:21,508 --> 00:37:24,651
Sorry... Everyone is...

459
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,425
It's not my fault.

460
00:37:26,508 --> 00:37:28,302
So everything's fine!

461
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:30,996
Shall we pass it round?

462
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:36,121
Good, isn't it?

463
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:39,552
Eat, son, eat.

464
00:37:46,342 --> 00:37:48,485
I think you need to eat a lot.

465
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,950
Yes, I know.

466
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:54,318
Long hair, a beard like Santa's...

467
00:37:54,342 --> 00:37:55,130
Yes, yes.

468
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,613
So shall we play?

469
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,331
Sarah, you first.

470
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:04,013
If you could wish for something,
right here, right now.

471
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,318
You want me?

472
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:09,133
No.

473
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:13,026
Easy! I wanted to see my mom
do something crazy one day

474
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,538
and here we are!

475
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:18,898
Marceline, your dearest wish,
right now?

476
00:38:19,717 --> 00:38:20,854
To fuck!

477
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,034
Unrestrainedly!

478
00:38:25,008 --> 00:38:26,277
So cute.

479
00:38:26,758 --> 00:38:28,989
You want to go and fuck her up?

480
00:38:29,842 --> 00:38:32,160
Are you stupid or just acting stupid?

481
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:34,559
- Now.
- Off the top of my head?

482
00:38:34,633 --> 00:38:36,559
Something you're desperate for.

483
00:38:36,633 --> 00:38:38,733
I wouldn't mind losing five kilos!

484
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,375
No cake for Aline.

485
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:41,255
Stéphane?

486
00:38:41,425 --> 00:38:43,175
Now, now, now.

487
00:38:43,258 --> 00:38:44,439
A kiss on the hand.

488
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,863
A what?

489
00:38:45,967 --> 00:38:48,330
Moving on...

490
00:38:48,675 --> 00:38:50,250
Things are turning soft.

491
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,157
Have we asked Olivier?

492
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:55,560
Mine's easy.

493
00:38:56,967 --> 00:39:00,401
Dinner with you one night next week.

494
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:02,044
We'll leave them to it.

495
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:02,965
Nice try!

496
00:39:03,092 --> 00:39:05,235
Well, it's pretty straightforward.

497
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,831
I'll have some cake.

498
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
What about your wish?

499
00:39:11,092 --> 00:39:12,885
I'll have some vodka too.

500
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:14,716
- You want some vodka?
- Yes.

501
00:39:17,592 --> 00:39:20,734
You talk about it
as if it were impossible.

502
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,939
It's complicated.

503
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:25,984
I just need to find the right person
but I dream of being a dad.

504
00:39:26,008 --> 00:39:28,065
That's a dream, not a wish.

505
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:32,071
It's a dream, but it's still possible.
I'm not some old guy.

506
00:39:32,675 --> 00:39:34,468
Pénélope, what's your wish?

507
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,731
A vacation.

508
00:39:35,842 --> 00:39:36,935
I understand.

509
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,712
We'll all come with you!

510
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:43,930
I love providence too much
to want to change it.

511
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,510
You haven't said anything.

512
00:39:48,592 --> 00:39:50,561
I have everything I desire.

513
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:52,358
Here, with us?

514
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:56,448
Yeah, I'm fulfilled.
I have no wishes, I'm fine.

515
00:39:57,467 --> 00:40:00,734
What about me?
No one cares what I want?

516
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:03,984
So, Rose, what's your dearest wish?

517
00:40:04,008 --> 00:40:08,996
My dearest wish is to be
a Yiddish singer.

518
00:40:09,383 --> 00:40:11,396
Yes! I sing Yiddish.

519
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:45,479
What? What?

520
00:40:46,508 --> 00:40:49,527
You're jealous.
I'm kissing her.

521
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:51,341
She's the most beautiful!

522
00:41:24,258 --> 00:41:28,443
<i>Put your arms around my neck
I'll cling to your dreams.</i>

523
00:41:28,467 --> 00:41:32,484
<i>Joy infects even the most stupid.</i>

524
00:41:32,508 --> 00:41:36,901
<i>We will dance until the day dawns.</i>

525
00:41:36,925 --> 00:41:40,994
<i>Tell me the story of a happy romance.</i>

526
00:41:41,258 --> 00:41:44,058
<i>The world is sweeter
hanging from your lips.</i>

527
00:41:45,175 --> 00:41:48,763
<i>For life or just for tonight
let's walk together.</i>

528
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:53,318
<i>Kiss me again and lift my heart.</i>

529
00:41:53,342 --> 00:41:56,886
<i>Let's tell the story of a happy romance.</i>

530
00:41:57,633 --> 00:42:01,396
<i>Let's tell the story of a happy romance.</i>

531
00:42:01,842 --> 00:42:06,129
<i>Let's tell the story of a happy romance.</i>

532
00:42:40,092 --> 00:42:41,448
Now that's life!

533
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,687
That's life.

534
00:42:45,217 --> 00:42:48,016
It was a lovely dinner party.

535
00:42:48,092 --> 00:42:49,273
I loved your friends.

536
00:42:49,383 --> 00:42:52,183
Don't forget to give her
the makroudh recipe.

537
00:42:52,217 --> 00:42:54,055
<i>Yes, but I have to go now.</i>

538
00:42:54,133 --> 00:42:56,977
- You'll call me back?
<i>- Yes, we'll talk later.</i>

539
00:42:58,133 --> 00:42:59,708
We could go for coffee.

540
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,769
<i>I have to go now. Take care.</i>

541
00:43:01,842 --> 00:43:02,935
All right, dear.

542
00:43:32,008 --> 00:43:34,239
Hello.
Are you waiting for someone?

543
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,657
No, I'm on my own.

544
00:43:35,758 --> 00:43:37,421
What can I get you?

545
00:43:39,967 --> 00:43:41,367
I don't know.

546
00:43:41,467 --> 00:43:43,260
Well, take your time.

547
00:43:45,717 --> 00:43:47,598
No, wait, I know.

548
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:50,332
- A small vodka with almonds.
- OK.

549
00:43:50,383 --> 00:43:53,315
- You have almonds?
- Sure, we'll find you some.

550
00:44:18,217 --> 00:44:19,267
There.

551
00:44:19,717 --> 00:44:21,248
So, didn't you like it?

552
00:44:21,342 --> 00:44:22,960
I've never liked it.

553
00:44:24,133 --> 00:44:25,971
So why did you order vodka?

554
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:27,056
I don't know.

555
00:44:29,925 --> 00:44:32,768
Do many people come to bars alone?

556
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,068
Yeah, it happens.

557
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,400
I don't seem weird?

558
00:44:35,842 --> 00:44:36,935
Not at all!

559
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:38,667
No, don't tease me.

560
00:44:39,133 --> 00:44:41,102
I'm not teasing, you're free,

561
00:44:41,217 --> 00:44:43,929
you don't need a chaperone
in this day and age.

562
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:47,717
Right.

563
00:44:49,383 --> 00:44:50,564
I'd better go.

564
00:45:03,008 --> 00:45:05,283
- What are you doing?
- You made me jump!

565
00:45:05,342 --> 00:45:07,923
- Where were you?
- Out shopping.

566
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,810
What's with the hair?
Are you off to a bar mitzvah?

567
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:14,298
Cut it out, it cost me a fortune!

568
00:45:16,008 --> 00:45:18,459
- You look like a hoodlum.
- Let me help.

569
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:20,871
I don't need help, I can walk alone.

570
00:45:20,925 --> 00:45:22,150
All right, sorry.

571
00:45:23,592 --> 00:45:25,385
Stop it!

572
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:29,188
Go lie down in front of TV
and leave me alone.

573
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,806
<i>Hello?</i>

574
00:45:42,383 --> 00:45:45,443
Hi, Sophie, it's Pierre, Rose's son.

575
00:45:45,467 --> 00:45:47,961
<i>Pierre Goldberg? How's it going?</i>

576
00:45:48,008 --> 00:45:51,568
Fine, thanks. I'm not disturbing you?

577
00:45:51,592 --> 00:45:52,467
<i>No.</i>

578
00:45:52,592 --> 00:45:55,435
I wanted to thank you
for calling my mother.

579
00:45:55,467 --> 00:45:56,648
<i>Oh, it was nothing.</i>

580
00:45:56,758 --> 00:45:59,734
Oh, it was, it reassured her a lot.

581
00:45:59,758 --> 00:46:00,852
<i>Well, I'm glad.</i>

582
00:46:02,175 --> 00:46:04,406
<i>I'd better go. Take care.</i>

583
00:46:04,467 --> 00:46:06,523
<i>We should get together sometime.</i>

584
00:46:06,592 --> 00:46:08,561
Yes, with pleasure. Good idea.

585
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:13,407
Maybe this week?

586
00:46:14,008 --> 00:46:16,371
<i>This week... perhaps one evening?</i>

587
00:46:16,425 --> 00:46:18,743
Yes, an evening if you like.

588
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,276
I'm on duty,
but I'll work something out.

589
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,300
<i>OK.</i>

590
00:46:23,925 --> 00:46:26,112
Well, see you very soon, then.

591
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:27,644
<i>Take care.</i>

592
00:46:32,383 --> 00:46:33,652
Switch it off!

593
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,138
I can't sleep!

594
00:46:59,133 --> 00:47:01,364
My daughter.
Am I disturbing you?

595
00:47:03,717 --> 00:47:05,948
I wanted to have coffee.

596
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,182
All right, some other time.

597
00:47:09,258 --> 00:47:10,527
Take care.

598
00:47:21,092 --> 00:47:23,935
We went to an Alsatian brasserie.

599
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:26,461
- Nice evening?
- Yes, very.

600
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:43,256
So was the dessert good?

601
00:47:43,592 --> 00:47:45,254
You wanted to try it.
Sorry!

602
00:47:45,342 --> 00:47:47,091
No, I don't like litchis.

603
00:47:48,925 --> 00:47:51,375
It's funny, seeing you with the kippa.

604
00:47:52,342 --> 00:47:54,223
I usually wear the tzitzit.

605
00:47:56,133 --> 00:47:57,577
It's crazy.

606
00:47:57,675 --> 00:47:58,769
Why?

607
00:47:59,883 --> 00:48:02,377
Don't, you look like my father!

608
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,109
It took us ten years to have the twins.

609
00:48:09,133 --> 00:48:10,402
Ten years.

610
00:48:11,383 --> 00:48:13,133
You think that helped?

611
00:48:13,758 --> 00:48:15,464
More than you think, yes.

612
00:48:19,342 --> 00:48:23,017
So how do you bring meaning
to your life?

613
00:48:26,383 --> 00:48:29,227
For me, the meaning is very muddled.

614
00:48:29,258 --> 00:48:30,396
Why?

615
00:48:33,508 --> 00:48:35,434
Why did you never have kids?

616
00:48:41,508 --> 00:48:43,083
Those guys are stupid.

617
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:49,652
As kids, we all had a crush on you.

618
00:48:49,717 --> 00:48:50,717
- Bullshit.
- It's true!

619
00:48:52,258 --> 00:48:54,259
You've always been
the prettiest girl in the world.

620
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:02,068
Sorry, but you know it's the first time
I've had an intimate dinner

621
00:49:02,092 --> 00:49:03,710
with a woman who isn't my wife.

622
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,806
Yeah?

623
00:49:06,925 --> 00:49:08,675
I don't know why I said that.

624
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,294
It's the drink, I'm not used to it.

625
00:49:13,175 --> 00:49:15,844
This wine isn't very good.

626
00:49:15,883 --> 00:49:18,071
Kosher wine never is.

627
00:49:22,217 --> 00:49:23,223
Sorry.

628
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,125
Stop taking the piss!

629
00:49:26,258 --> 00:49:29,102
I'm not taking the piss!
You haven't changed.

630
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,129
Neither have you.

631
00:49:38,383 --> 00:49:41,183
Well, seeing as I have surgery
early tomorrow

632
00:49:41,217 --> 00:49:43,491
I'd better not stay late.

633
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:45,907
Should I drop you off?

634
00:49:46,383 --> 00:49:48,002
Yeah, with pleasure.

635
00:49:51,092 --> 00:49:52,229
Excuse me?

636
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,550
The check, please.

637
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:51,390
Why don't you answer the phone?

638
00:50:51,467 --> 00:50:52,473
I'm here!

639
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:56,410
- What's so funny?
- I don't know!

640
00:50:56,467 --> 00:50:57,604
You're weird.

641
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:59,581
Sorry, my son.

642
00:50:59,675 --> 00:51:01,337
Where'd you put my suit?

643
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:02,425
Which suit?

644
00:51:02,508 --> 00:51:04,390
My only suit. For the hearing.

645
00:51:06,508 --> 00:51:07,515
Is it today?

646
00:51:08,842 --> 00:51:10,898
Are you kidding?
Did you forget?

647
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:12,979
You've known about it for weeks.

648
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:14,581
You didn't remind me.

649
00:51:14,717 --> 00:51:15,548
You're joking.

650
00:51:15,675 --> 00:51:19,401
I took an appointment for
the spa treatment you bought me.

651
00:51:19,425 --> 00:51:22,651
I'll cancel.
Don't worry, I'll come with you.

652
00:51:22,675 --> 00:51:24,206
- Oh no.
- Why not?

653
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,232
Don't cancel the Crillon!
I'm a big boy, I can cope.

654
00:51:27,258 --> 00:51:28,527
Are you mad at me?

655
00:51:28,633 --> 00:51:31,127
No, you just forgot, it happens.

656
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:34,017
You go and enjoy yourself.

657
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:35,360
Enjoy myself how?

658
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:37,610
Apparently it's great, OK?

659
00:51:37,675 --> 00:51:41,526
I'm sorry, son.
I'll join you, whatever happens.

660
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:42,600
I'll be quick!

661
00:52:08,675 --> 00:52:11,169
Mrs Goldberg,
for the phyto-aromatic care?

662
00:52:11,217 --> 00:52:12,267
Yes, that's me.

663
00:52:19,425 --> 00:52:22,313
I'll leave you to get undressed.
I'll be right back.

664
00:52:22,342 --> 00:52:23,566
Undress completely?

665
00:52:23,675 --> 00:52:26,518
You'll find
some disposable underclothes.

666
00:53:51,008 --> 00:53:52,277
Shall we?

667
00:54:00,995 --> 00:54:05,692
Léon Goldberg, born in Suresnes,
26 January 1982,

668
00:54:05,717 --> 00:54:10,901
charged by the prosecution services
with the sale of stolen goods,

669
00:54:10,925 --> 00:54:13,681
is found guilty as charged.

670
00:54:13,758 --> 00:54:18,440
This court sentences him to
three months in prison, suspended.

671
00:54:24,675 --> 00:54:27,475
- Could I please call my son?
- Of course, ma'am.

672
00:54:27,508 --> 00:54:28,558
Thank you.

673
00:54:35,175 --> 00:54:37,275
<i>Léon here, leave a message.</i>

674
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:42,388
Léon... answer the phone, please.

675
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,237
I want to know where to find you.

676
00:54:53,342 --> 00:54:54,130
<i>Hello?</i>

677
00:54:54,258 --> 00:54:58,152
Sarah, do you have any news of Léon?
I can't reach him.

678
00:54:58,425 --> 00:55:03,234
<i>He just called, he won't go to jail.
He got three months - suspended.</i>

679
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:06,901
<i>He's going to Pierre's,
he wants to be left alone tonight.</i>

680
00:55:06,925 --> 00:55:07,800
Sure?

681
00:55:07,925 --> 00:55:09,763
<i>Yes, he doesn't want to see anyone.</i>

682
00:55:09,842 --> 00:55:13,151
<i>Relax, Mom, everything's fine.
I'll call you tomorrow.</i>

683
00:55:13,175 --> 00:55:15,057
Thanks, dear. Take care.

684
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,075
Change of direction.

685
00:55:19,133 --> 00:55:21,889
I'm going back to the 19th,
not to the courtroom.

686
00:55:21,925 --> 00:55:23,193
Very well, ma'am.

687
00:55:38,467 --> 00:55:39,954
Something wrong, ma'am?

688
00:55:40,592 --> 00:55:42,254
- Do you remember me?
- Yes.

689
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:44,967
You look a bit down.
Come and have a drink.

690
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,758
It'll warm you up.

691
00:55:46,842 --> 00:55:47,892
Thank you.

692
00:55:50,008 --> 00:55:51,583
It's not very warm.

693
00:55:51,675 --> 00:55:52,769
It's cold.

694
00:56:02,758 --> 00:56:06,958
I didn't promise a great atmosphere.
Mondays are always quiet.

695
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:11,059
Now what will you have?

696
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:16,913
A small vodka, with almonds.

697
00:56:16,967 --> 00:56:18,760
No, you won't drink it.

698
00:56:19,092 --> 00:56:20,448
I think I will.

699
00:56:21,925 --> 00:56:24,463
I know.
What's your favorite fruit juice?

700
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:26,446
Apricot.

701
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,556
So...

702
00:56:55,675 --> 00:56:56,812
Cheers.

703
00:57:02,633 --> 00:57:03,640
Well!

704
00:57:04,217 --> 00:57:05,966
What's happened?

705
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:08,358
I don't know.

706
00:57:11,592 --> 00:57:13,473
I don't feel so good.

707
00:57:14,258 --> 00:57:16,140
Why don't you feel good?

708
00:57:17,217 --> 00:57:18,310
I'm ashamed.

709
00:57:18,425 --> 00:57:19,431
Of what?

710
00:57:22,425 --> 00:57:25,969
Go ahead tell me, it's just us.
You'll feel better.

711
00:57:27,175 --> 00:57:28,794
What's your name?

712
00:57:28,925 --> 00:57:30,019
Rose.

713
00:57:31,675 --> 00:57:32,900
Glad to know you.

714
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,450
I'm Laurent.

715
00:57:35,883 --> 00:57:39,121
So which bastards have upset you?

716
00:57:39,175 --> 00:57:40,356
Bastards?

717
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,831
The bastards are me.

718
00:57:43,967 --> 00:57:45,629
What have you done?

719
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:47,950
I'm selfish.

720
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:50,675
What's the use at my age?

721
00:57:53,508 --> 00:57:54,777
What do you mean?

722
00:57:57,175 --> 00:57:59,975
What's the point of pampering myself
at my age,

723
00:58:00,008 --> 00:58:03,568
just to sit on the sofa
watching <i>Countdown</i>?

724
00:58:03,592 --> 00:58:06,693
Nothing wrong with <i>Countdown.</i>
I like it.

725
00:58:06,717 --> 00:58:08,073
I'm stupid.

726
00:58:10,842 --> 00:58:14,526
Have you seen my skin,
my arms, my hands,

727
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:16,563
my face, my breasts?

728
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,568
Why bother?

729
00:58:20,675 --> 00:58:21,507
What's wrong?

730
00:58:21,675 --> 00:58:25,306
I think you look fine,
you're... very beautiful.

731
00:58:25,951 --> 00:58:28,445
I didn't mean your breasts.
Sorry.

732
00:58:28,737 --> 00:58:30,049
How old are you?

733
00:58:30,842 --> 00:58:32,811
You want to know how old I am?

734
00:58:32,883 --> 00:58:34,415
No, I... sorry.

735
00:58:36,508 --> 00:58:38,652
Anyway, I think you're beautiful.

736
00:58:39,967 --> 00:58:41,323
I don't understand.

737
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:44,081
Are you hitting on me?

738
00:58:45,175 --> 00:58:46,619
Oh, I'm sorry...

739
00:58:48,008 --> 00:58:50,896
Only the last man to hit on me
was my husband.

740
00:58:50,925 --> 00:58:51,925
Your husband?

741
00:58:51,967 --> 00:58:54,023
He's wonderful. Not like me.

742
00:58:54,092 --> 00:58:55,142
How so?

743
00:58:58,592 --> 00:59:00,735
Give me another drink.

744
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,981
Sure?

745
00:59:04,717 --> 00:59:05,898
I'll tell you...

746
00:59:06,383 --> 00:59:08,177
I had children late in life.

747
00:59:08,508 --> 00:59:11,440
The poor things
aren't very good at romance.

748
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:16,276
One is still in love with
her halfwit ex-husband,

749
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,401
another has veered into orthodoxy,

750
00:59:19,425 --> 00:59:22,838
the third acts like he's married to me.

751
00:59:23,342 --> 00:59:25,180
How old are they?

752
00:59:26,842 --> 00:59:28,811
You know what? I'm sick of it.

753
00:59:31,592 --> 00:59:33,604
See? I'm bad news.

754
00:59:35,342 --> 00:59:38,361
Here I am, in a bar,
on a Monday evening.

755
00:59:39,717 --> 00:59:41,729
Like a loose woman!

756
00:59:47,967 --> 00:59:50,592
Another for you,
and another for me.

757
00:59:53,258 --> 00:59:54,258
Thank you.

758
01:00:41,758 --> 01:00:43,464
And another for me.

759
01:00:44,675 --> 01:00:45,900
You're depressed too?

760
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,538
Well, who isn't?

761
01:00:48,008 --> 01:00:49,409
So tell me.

762
01:00:49,508 --> 01:00:51,434
I've told you everything.

763
01:00:51,508 --> 01:00:54,090
My girlfriend doesn't want kids.

764
01:00:54,133 --> 01:00:57,896
I don't get it, I'm pretty cute,
I'd make a good father.

765
01:00:57,925 --> 01:00:59,238
<i>Mnaïchalik!</i>

766
01:00:59,383 --> 01:01:01,089
So where's your husband?

767
01:01:01,883 --> 01:01:03,721
He died, in January.

768
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,151
You know how to brighten things up!
So you're free?

769
01:01:07,175 --> 01:01:08,400
Yes...

770
01:01:08,842 --> 01:01:10,417
Now I'm blushing.

771
01:01:11,842 --> 01:01:14,379
Frankly I don't know
what I'm doing here.

772
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:18,538
Do you want to go?

773
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:19,640
No.

774
01:01:21,008 --> 01:01:23,065
Do you want me to put music on?

775
01:01:23,758 --> 01:01:24,758
Yes.

776
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:29,613
A bar with no music.
Now that's weird!

777
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:33,719
- What would you like?
- Something oriental.

778
01:01:36,675 --> 01:01:37,943
I'm 78.

779
01:01:38,967 --> 01:01:41,110
See how I brighten things up?

780
01:01:41,217 --> 01:01:42,879
To hell with age.

781
01:01:42,967 --> 01:01:45,679
Getting old is the best way
to stay alive.

782
01:01:45,717 --> 01:01:47,598
Ah, highfalutin words!

783
01:01:48,925 --> 01:01:50,938
How old do you think I am?

784
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,375
To hell with age, right?

785
01:02:08,467 --> 01:02:11,179
Actually, I feel embarrassed.

786
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,550
I should go.

787
01:02:15,633 --> 01:02:17,559
No, sorry, it's me.

788
01:02:18,508 --> 01:02:19,777
I didn't mean to...

789
01:02:19,883 --> 01:02:20,890
What?

790
01:02:21,842 --> 01:02:23,373
Would you like to dance?

791
01:02:24,175 --> 01:02:26,931
Just to make things
even more embarrassing?

792
01:02:31,842 --> 01:02:32,842
Ah, fuck it.

793
01:02:48,133 --> 01:02:50,802
Men who dance like that are a disaster!

794
01:02:51,967 --> 01:02:54,023
I eat better than I dance.

795
01:02:54,092 --> 01:02:55,930
Do you like makroudhs?

796
01:02:56,008 --> 01:02:59,333
Those things stuffed with dates?
I'd kill for them.

797
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:01,075
I'll make you some.

798
01:03:01,175 --> 01:03:02,269
Yeah?

799
01:03:02,925 --> 01:03:04,193
Ah, I adore you!

800
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,682
- I'm going to kiss you.
- No.

801
01:06:50,508 --> 01:06:53,002
Yes, that one's nice.
I want it.

802
01:06:57,092 --> 01:06:58,448
Ah, lovely.

803
01:07:00,467 --> 01:07:01,604
That's a keeper.

804
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,444
Not bad, not bad...

805
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:07,300
Pretty.

806
01:07:10,592 --> 01:07:12,866
Hello, ma'am, can I help you?

807
01:07:14,175 --> 01:07:16,188
Why are you speaking like that?

808
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,613
I can hear you fine.

809
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:21,075
Sorry.
Have you found what you want?

810
01:07:21,175 --> 01:07:22,356
Yes.

811
01:07:23,133 --> 01:07:25,102
I'll take them all.

812
01:07:25,175 --> 01:07:26,181
Thank you.

813
01:07:41,175 --> 01:07:44,763
Annaëlle, you're a pain!
Next time, take your keys.

814
01:07:51,092 --> 01:07:52,841
- All right?
- Yeah, you?

815
01:07:54,383 --> 01:07:55,740
Oh, you came up?

816
01:07:55,842 --> 01:07:57,286
Not even a hello?

817
01:07:58,050 --> 01:07:59,756
Sure. Hello.

818
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:00,979
Can I come in?

819
01:08:02,008 --> 01:08:03,277
Of course.

820
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:08,613
Coffee?

821
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:10,292
Yeah, with pleasure.

822
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:17,585
Smells good.

823
01:08:30,133 --> 01:08:31,534
Mmm, tasty!

824
01:08:34,092 --> 01:08:35,316
Staying for dinner?

825
01:08:35,425 --> 01:08:36,913
Sorry, I can't.

826
01:08:42,092 --> 01:08:43,092
Thanks.

827
01:09:02,133 --> 01:09:03,183
So...

828
01:09:03,758 --> 01:09:05,071
what's up?

829
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,175
You OK?

830
01:09:08,342 --> 01:09:10,792
Yeah, fine... You?

831
01:09:10,842 --> 01:09:12,811
Exhausted.
Too many nights out.

832
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,919
How's your mother?

833
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:17,818
She's doing better.

834
01:09:22,008 --> 01:09:25,158
You're not wearing eye makeup.
I like it.

835
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,288
You smoke too much.

836
01:09:43,925 --> 01:09:44,931
So...

837
01:09:46,342 --> 01:09:47,698
Have you got a guy?

838
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,550
None of your business.

839
01:09:57,092 --> 01:09:59,148
Sure you won't stay for dinner?

840
01:10:00,092 --> 01:10:02,760
- I'm going to be a dad.
- What... why?

841
01:10:03,133 --> 01:10:04,227
Why?

842
01:10:04,342 --> 01:10:05,479
What did you say?

843
01:10:05,592 --> 01:10:06,816
I'm having a baby.

844
01:10:08,758 --> 01:10:10,989
Why come here to tell me that?

845
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:12,975
I thought I should.

846
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:14,800
I wanted to do things right.

847
01:10:15,467 --> 01:10:16,998
Do things right?

848
01:10:18,008 --> 01:10:20,283
Well, keep you informed.

849
01:10:20,675 --> 01:10:23,300
Informed, yeah, right.

850
01:10:23,342 --> 01:10:26,185
Come on, you'd moan
if you were the last to hear.

851
01:10:26,592 --> 01:10:27,729
I feel sick.

852
01:10:27,842 --> 01:10:29,023
Don't be dramatic.

853
01:10:29,133 --> 01:10:30,752
OK, you can go now.

854
01:10:30,842 --> 01:10:32,985
I knew you'd react like this.

855
01:10:33,592 --> 01:10:36,960
She's 37, no kids,
we've been together two years.

856
01:10:37,217 --> 01:10:39,448
Why do I need to justify myself?

857
01:10:39,508 --> 01:10:42,734
You want this kid?
Of course you don't, so shut up.

858
01:10:42,758 --> 01:10:45,033
Enough of the insults. Calm down.

859
01:10:46,133 --> 01:10:47,883
I want the baby for her.

860
01:10:49,175 --> 01:10:51,013
How far gone is she?

861
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:52,907
Four months.

862
01:10:54,133 --> 01:10:56,059
So you're keeping it.

863
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,856
Try to be more gracious.

864
01:10:59,342 --> 01:11:01,048
Life goes on, Sarah.

865
01:11:01,717 --> 01:11:04,473
What about me? And Annaëlle?

866
01:11:04,508 --> 01:11:06,608
She knows and she's delighted.

867
01:11:11,651 --> 01:11:15,817
You wanted to be on your own,
Family life was suffocating you!

868
01:11:15,842 --> 01:11:17,242
So what's going on?

869
01:11:17,267 --> 01:11:18,842
You said it, dammit!

870
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:21,631
I'm not making it up.
You said it!

871
01:11:21,675 --> 01:11:23,819
Annaëlle, I'm leaving.
Take care.

872
01:11:48,133 --> 01:11:50,190
He said not to tell you.

873
01:11:51,717 --> 01:11:54,123
Sorry, Mom, I should have told you.

874
01:12:09,592 --> 01:12:10,685
I love you.

875
01:12:43,383 --> 01:12:46,446
Now where has he put them?
Here they are!

876
01:13:04,008 --> 01:13:06,108
What's that?

877
01:13:10,633 --> 01:13:12,646
All these buttons, but which...?

878
01:13:12,758 --> 01:13:14,421
Your car's all wrong, Philippe!

879
01:13:20,717 --> 01:13:22,642
It can't be that difficult...

880
01:13:24,050 --> 01:13:25,756
Ah, got it.

881
01:13:26,342 --> 01:13:31,154
So, these are the headlamps... there.

882
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:02,800
Bob!

883
01:14:17,758 --> 01:14:19,159
Jojo!

884
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,157
You've got a car?

885
01:14:21,258 --> 01:14:22,527
Come on, get in!

886
01:14:22,633 --> 01:14:24,339
Who'll look after the store?

887
01:14:24,425 --> 01:14:26,263
That useless husband of yours!

888
01:14:27,008 --> 01:14:30,115
She comes and goes,
she does as she pleases.

889
01:14:44,258 --> 01:14:45,439
Fancy you driving!

890
01:14:45,592 --> 01:14:47,692
- What's bitten you?
- Bitten me?

891
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:49,113
I do whatever I like.

892
01:14:49,217 --> 01:14:51,055
Goodness, you've gone crazy.

893
01:14:51,133 --> 01:14:54,546
It's inevitable, you're grieving.
When my mother...

894
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:56,050
Oh, shut up!

895
01:14:57,050 --> 01:14:58,538
The way you talk!

896
01:14:58,633 --> 01:15:00,646
For years I've wanted to tell you
to shut up...

897
01:15:01,493 --> 01:15:02,192
So shut up!

898
01:15:02,217 --> 01:15:03,530
You shut up!

899
01:15:04,008 --> 01:15:06,677
So what now
that you've got yourself a car?

900
01:15:08,188 --> 01:15:10,156
Take me to Galeries Lafayette.

901
01:15:15,717 --> 01:15:17,073
Come on, kidnap me.

902
01:15:37,258 --> 01:15:38,615
On the house.

903
01:15:44,508 --> 01:15:45,865
Handsome, isn't he?

904
01:15:47,592 --> 01:15:49,210
Pushy, you mean.

905
01:15:50,967 --> 01:15:53,548
I'm so pleased you suggested coffee.

906
01:15:55,633 --> 01:15:57,952
Look... I got you this.

907
01:16:00,342 --> 01:16:01,960
You ever see me with lipstick?

908
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:03,538
A little is good.

909
01:16:04,717 --> 01:16:06,510
Guess what. Today, I drove.

910
01:16:08,092 --> 01:16:09,667
You didn't kill anyone?

911
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:13,519
I haven't driven in 40 years.
It all came back to me.

912
01:16:13,842 --> 01:16:15,985
It's like riding a bike.

913
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:17,494
You've never ridden one.

914
01:16:17,592 --> 01:16:20,480
Jojo couldn't get over it. Actually...

915
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:22,038
I think she was jealous.

916
01:16:22,842 --> 01:16:24,242
She's bored.

917
01:16:32,633 --> 01:16:33,633
Mom...

918
01:16:33,967 --> 01:16:35,454
I love this song!

919
01:16:40,925 --> 01:16:41,925
Thank you.

920
01:16:46,258 --> 01:16:47,659
You were saying?

921
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,593
Nothing, skip it.

922
01:16:50,717 --> 01:16:52,161
I'm here now, tell me.

923
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:55,993
No, it's fine.

924
01:16:59,008 --> 01:17:00,452
You miss Dad, right?

925
01:17:02,758 --> 01:17:03,808
I miss him too.

926
01:17:08,217 --> 01:17:09,617
You're beautiful, Mom.

927
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:34,519
All this affected craziness...

928
01:17:35,092 --> 01:17:36,973
I don't like it, it's unnatural.

929
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:39,806
Right, I'm going to my room.

930
01:18:12,342 --> 01:18:13,342
Amen.

931
01:18:34,633 --> 01:18:36,339
Calm down, kids!

932
01:18:37,425 --> 01:18:39,875
The voice of authority.
Nice one, Pierre.

933
01:18:39,925 --> 01:18:41,807
- When is Tsilla back?
- I don't know.

934
01:18:41,883 --> 01:18:43,415
You don't know?

935
01:18:43,508 --> 01:18:45,346
Sorry, she's back on Tuesday.

936
01:18:56,883 --> 01:18:58,852
I'll go fetch the food.

937
01:19:08,175 --> 01:19:09,225
You're drinking?

938
01:19:10,550 --> 01:19:11,950
Why shouldn't I?

939
01:19:16,217 --> 01:19:17,441
The meatballs.

940
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:19,169
Can I have a hand?

941
01:19:22,592 --> 01:19:23,592
Thanks.

942
01:19:28,217 --> 01:19:29,704
Thanks, honey.

943
01:19:34,425 --> 01:19:35,431
Oh shit.

944
01:19:38,717 --> 01:19:40,642
Mom... What's the matter?

945
01:19:42,092 --> 01:19:44,061
- Mom.
- What's wrong?

946
01:19:44,758 --> 01:19:46,202
Fuck!

947
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,300
What?

948
01:19:47,342 --> 01:19:50,098
You mixed up the harissa
and the tomato sauce.

949
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,375
You want to kill us?

950
01:19:55,842 --> 01:19:57,198
Well, I was in a hurry.

951
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:00,668
- Why, too busy with work?
- Mom's snowed under!

952
01:20:01,883 --> 01:20:03,940
Go ahead, cook your own meal.

953
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,864
- What's got into you?
- Nothing.

954
01:20:06,967 --> 01:20:10,467
I've better things to do than feed you.
You're all grown up.

955
01:20:13,967 --> 01:20:16,723
Mom's right.
Not that it changes anything.

956
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:17,588
Exactly.

957
01:20:17,717 --> 01:20:18,985
What do you mean?

958
01:20:19,092 --> 01:20:22,151
Men never walk out
on women who can't cook.

959
01:20:22,175 --> 01:20:23,269
True enough.

960
01:20:24,675 --> 01:20:26,250
Sorry, I don't understand.

961
01:20:26,342 --> 01:20:30,901
They get taken to restaurants,
pampered, cared for...

962
01:20:30,925 --> 01:20:33,594
Maybe guys fear they'll walk out,

963
01:20:33,675 --> 01:20:35,163
or just want to feel manly.

964
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:37,006
How is this related to harissa?

965
01:20:37,342 --> 01:20:38,392
It isn't.

966
01:20:38,883 --> 01:20:40,896
Actually it is. Have you heard?

967
01:20:42,175 --> 01:20:45,412
Nicolas is going to be a dad. <i>L'Chaim!</i>

968
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:46,882
<i>L'Chaim,</i> Mom.

969
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:48,102
You didn't tell me.

970
01:20:48,258 --> 01:20:50,271
Well, I'm telling you now.

971
01:20:51,008 --> 01:20:52,189
Did you know?

972
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:55,925
Maybe it'll help you move on.

973
01:21:01,842 --> 01:21:03,504
Honestly!

974
01:21:05,258 --> 01:21:08,058
You're making me do
all kinds of stupid things.

975
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:12,687
What a chore.

976
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:14,625
She's totally crazy.

977
01:21:14,717 --> 01:21:16,817
Don't talk about
your mother that way!

978
01:21:16,883 --> 01:21:18,765
She's flipped, she's hysterical.

979
01:21:18,883 --> 01:21:20,765
Calm down, she's tired.

980
01:21:20,842 --> 01:21:23,510
Yes, she's tired.
Understandably so.

981
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:25,212
You don't live with her.

982
01:21:29,842 --> 01:21:32,248
Leave it, Mom, we'll come and help.

983
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:34,225
Look, we'd better go.

984
01:21:34,612 --> 01:21:36,100
We're leaving, Mom.

985
01:21:36,383 --> 01:21:37,958
We'll help you first.

986
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:41,325
Sarah, Annaëlle, I'll take you back.

987
01:21:41,425 --> 01:21:42,738
I'm on foot.

988
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:47,109
Léon, please, go easy on Mom.

989
01:21:47,133 --> 01:21:48,183
Come on, join in.

990
01:21:48,342 --> 01:21:49,348
Yeah, join in...

991
01:21:49,467 --> 01:21:51,085
Don't just take your own plate.

992
01:21:56,258 --> 01:21:57,833
Aren't you going out?

993
01:21:57,925 --> 01:21:58,925
No.

994
01:22:01,008 --> 01:22:02,583
What are you doing?

995
01:22:02,675 --> 01:22:03,900
Just popping out.

996
01:22:04,008 --> 01:22:06,852
Popping out?
Have you seen the time?

997
01:22:07,758 --> 01:22:09,684
I need something from the store.

998
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,209
I'll go, it's 10.30, go back to bed.

999
01:22:12,258 --> 01:22:13,615
It's fine, I'll go.

1000
01:22:13,717 --> 01:22:14,723
You're weird.

1001
01:22:14,842 --> 01:22:15,842
Let me out.

1002
01:22:15,883 --> 01:22:19,359
Calm down, where are you going?
It's dangerous!

1003
01:22:19,383 --> 01:22:22,359
All that makeup!
What's wrong with you?

1004
01:22:22,383 --> 01:22:24,571
I need your permission?
I live here.

1005
01:22:24,633 --> 01:22:26,733
Makeup to go to the grocery store?

1006
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,331
You piss me off!
Now move.

1007
01:22:28,425 --> 01:22:32,234
You're cracked.
Remove that makeup, you're staying here!

1008
01:22:32,258 --> 01:22:33,258
You're crazy!

1009
01:22:33,342 --> 01:22:35,048
I'm crazy?!

1010
01:22:35,133 --> 01:22:36,621
You think I don't know?

1011
01:22:36,758 --> 01:22:39,901
Know what?
Stand aside, I'm your mother.

1012
01:22:39,925 --> 01:22:42,112
Mother? What mother?

1013
01:22:42,217 --> 01:22:44,885
You forget everyone.
Like me, at my hearing.

1014
01:22:44,925 --> 01:22:46,850
Don't be ridiculous, you insisted.

1015
01:22:46,925 --> 01:22:48,062
You're shameful!

1016
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,593
Leave me alone!

1017
01:22:50,967 --> 01:22:53,986
You're in mourning...
in fucking mourning!

1018
01:23:14,758 --> 01:23:16,333
What happened?

1019
01:23:18,258 --> 01:23:19,396
Mom...

1020
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:21,694
I'm fed up of having him on my back.

1021
01:23:21,758 --> 01:23:23,815
Does he think he's the patriarch?

1022
01:23:24,633 --> 01:23:26,602
I swear he's been spying on me.

1023
01:23:26,675 --> 01:23:29,038
I'm indulging myself for once.

1024
01:23:29,592 --> 01:23:31,167
Wait, what's happened?

1025
01:23:31,258 --> 01:23:34,359
He has no right to talk to me like that.

1026
01:23:34,383 --> 01:23:36,265
What did I do wrong?

1027
01:23:36,342 --> 01:23:37,829
I bet he's been spying.

1028
01:23:38,967 --> 01:23:40,716
What are you talking about?

1029
01:23:42,883 --> 01:23:44,983
I've met someone.

1030
01:23:47,008 --> 01:23:48,058
What?!

1031
01:23:48,675 --> 01:23:49,988
Don't start.

1032
01:23:53,675 --> 01:23:55,906
- The idiot with the cakes?
- So?

1033
01:23:56,008 --> 01:23:58,590
I like him, he likes me.
Is that shameful?

1034
01:24:00,758 --> 01:24:04,318
He makes me laugh,
he's handsome, he looks at me...

1035
01:24:04,342 --> 01:24:05,786
I'm not doing any harm.

1036
01:24:06,967 --> 01:24:10,029
I don't want to know.
This is bullshit, Mom!

1037
01:24:11,258 --> 01:24:14,277
What can you do with him?
He's Pierre's age!

1038
01:24:14,342 --> 01:24:16,267
No, he's two years older.

1039
01:24:16,342 --> 01:24:17,873
It's the same thing.

1040
01:24:19,633 --> 01:24:21,208
You're off your rocker.

1041
01:24:21,508 --> 01:24:23,477
You're all off your rockers!

1042
01:24:25,550 --> 01:24:27,563
I don't know you anymore.

1043
01:24:27,633 --> 01:24:30,521
You don't mind it
when Marceline acts all free.

1044
01:24:32,675 --> 01:24:35,256
- You're not listening.
- No, you aren't.

1045
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:37,006
What do you mean?

1046
01:24:38,842 --> 01:24:40,591
Why didn't you tell me about Nicolas?

1047
01:24:42,508 --> 01:24:44,040
What an asshole.

1048
01:24:45,258 --> 01:24:47,446
You'll find someone else.

1049
01:24:47,967 --> 01:24:49,104
Look at me.

1050
01:25:05,592 --> 01:25:06,642
There you go.

1051
01:25:19,425 --> 01:25:20,475
Bye.

1052
01:30:43,133 --> 01:30:44,752
Hey! How's it going?

1053
01:30:45,717 --> 01:30:48,035
- Are you expecting someone?
- No.

1054
01:30:48,133 --> 01:30:48,965
Can I take this?

1055
01:30:49,133 --> 01:30:51,977
- Is it me you're waiting for?
- Sure, come on.

1056
01:30:54,342 --> 01:30:55,786
- Hi.
- Hi.

1057
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,856
- Thank you.
- You were all alone.

1058
01:31:00,175 --> 01:31:01,532
Well, I'm not now.

1059
01:31:01,633 --> 01:31:03,339
- What's your name?
- Rose.

1060
01:31:03,425 --> 01:31:04,475
Welcome, Rose.

1061
01:31:06,467 --> 01:31:07,604
To your good health.

1062
01:31:07,717 --> 01:31:09,248
Well, it's vodka.

1063
01:31:09,883 --> 01:31:12,246
We're starting to get plastered too.

1064
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:17,359
It's important, it's inherited,
from your parents, your family...

1065
01:31:17,383 --> 01:31:19,089
Where are your roots, Rose?

1066
01:31:19,217 --> 01:31:20,267
I'm from Tunisia.

1067
01:31:20,383 --> 01:31:22,133
- Which part?
- Tunis.

1068
01:31:22,258 --> 01:31:25,058
I love Tunisia,
I've been to Djerba many times.

1069
01:31:25,883 --> 01:31:28,639
You're Tunisian at heart.
Djerba is for Americans.

1070
01:31:28,717 --> 01:31:29,854
Do you like makroudhs?

1071
01:31:30,008 --> 01:31:31,146
I love them!

1072
01:31:31,258 --> 01:31:32,396
No way!

1073
01:31:33,425 --> 01:31:34,913
Magic. She's a magician!

1074
01:31:35,050 --> 01:31:36,800
I made them this morning.

1075
01:31:37,175 --> 01:31:40,281
- My mother taught me.
- You must give me the recipe.

1076
01:31:40,342 --> 01:31:41,655
Try them and see.

1077
01:31:41,758 --> 01:31:43,290
We're in Tunisia!

1078
01:31:43,383 --> 01:31:45,527
We got lucky, running into you.

1079
01:31:56,967 --> 01:31:58,542
I'll explain the words.

1080
01:31:58,633 --> 01:32:02,177
She says that despite his faults,
he's very handsome.

1081
01:32:03,967 --> 01:32:06,635
He drives me up the wall

1082
01:32:07,050 --> 01:32:08,538
but I don't mind.

1083
01:32:09,050 --> 01:32:11,544
You'd have to be mad not to choose you.

1084
01:32:11,633 --> 01:32:13,121
You're right, he's stupid!

1085
01:32:15,175 --> 01:32:16,181
A drink?

1086
01:32:18,217 --> 01:32:20,798
So, Alexandre,
if you could wish for anything,

1087
01:32:20,883 --> 01:32:22,284
right here, right now.

1088
01:32:22,383 --> 01:32:25,526
Immediately?
If I could wish for something...

1089
01:32:25,550 --> 01:32:28,700
You'll take the piss but I don't mind.
I want a pony.

1090
01:32:28,758 --> 01:32:29,758
A pony?

1091
01:32:30,550 --> 01:32:31,950
Or a small horse.

1092
01:32:32,092 --> 01:32:33,492
That's a first!

1093
01:32:33,592 --> 01:32:35,298
- It's true!
- How about you?

1094
01:32:35,425 --> 01:32:39,100
What would be your dearest wish,
right here, right now?

1095
01:32:42,467 --> 01:32:44,698
For this evening to never end.

1096
01:32:48,883 --> 01:32:49,883
Cheers!

1097
01:33:38,717 --> 01:33:40,204
I can't get it in!

1098
01:34:05,217 --> 01:34:07,055
<i>Yareubi! </i>I can't fall any lower!

1099
01:34:19,467 --> 01:34:20,735
Mom?

1100
01:34:21,550 --> 01:34:23,519
Mom, are you OK?

1101
01:34:23,842 --> 01:34:25,680
Look at me. Mom?

1102
01:34:28,717 --> 01:34:30,335
I won't melt.

1103
01:34:31,133 --> 01:34:33,015
I had a fall, I'm not dead.

1104
01:34:34,258 --> 01:34:36,796
Being on my own doesn't mean it's over.

1105
01:34:38,925 --> 01:34:41,506
Being on my own won't kill me.

1106
01:34:42,008 --> 01:34:45,465
Anyway when you're alone,
you have lots of people around.

1107
01:34:49,175 --> 01:34:52,543
Does being so exemplary
make you any happier?

1108
01:34:54,175 --> 01:34:55,663
I'm not exemplary.

1109
01:34:56,092 --> 01:34:59,329
I do things for myself,
you should do the same.

1110
01:35:04,217 --> 01:35:05,485
I love you all.

1111
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:11,581
Yes, you were scared.

1112
01:35:12,383 --> 01:35:13,521
It's true, I'm old,

1113
01:35:13,675 --> 01:35:15,206
but I'm not dead.

1114
01:35:16,592 --> 01:35:19,217
I just hurt myself a bit, that's all.

1115
01:35:21,967 --> 01:35:24,766
Why do you get
so worried about me, Léon?

1116
01:35:25,425 --> 01:35:27,218
You scared me too.

1117
01:35:28,508 --> 01:35:30,171
You need to let me go,

1118
01:35:30,258 --> 01:35:32,227
and live your life.

1119
01:35:32,550 --> 01:35:35,918
What have I done or not done
to make you so afraid?

1120
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:38,618
You have your whole life ahead of you.

1121
01:35:40,717 --> 01:35:42,466
My life isn't ahead of me.

1122
01:35:45,383 --> 01:35:47,702
But I still have a little of it left.

1123
01:35:50,217 --> 01:35:54,066
When your father died,
I thought my life was over.

1124
01:35:55,175 --> 01:35:56,488
But I'm still here

1125
01:35:57,258 --> 01:35:59,227
and I'm going to live some more.

1126
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:01,182
There are still things to do.

1127
01:36:03,342 --> 01:36:05,705
I want to enjoy it all as much as I can

1128
01:36:05,758 --> 01:36:07,508
before it disappears.

1129
01:36:14,967 --> 01:36:17,241
I do everything the wrong way round.

1130
01:36:18,133 --> 01:36:20,889
When I take care of myself,
you're shocked.

1131
01:36:20,925 --> 01:36:24,293
When I neglect myself and smell,
you're appalled.

1132
01:36:25,467 --> 01:36:27,523
I heard you the other day.

1133
01:36:29,842 --> 01:36:31,767
I've lost the man of my life.

1134
01:36:32,508 --> 01:36:37,193
He could talk to you, reassure you,
calm you down, but I can't.

1135
01:36:37,217 --> 01:36:40,060
I can't say the word "I", it scares me.

1136
01:36:40,092 --> 01:36:42,542
I feel like I'll just spout nonsense.

1137
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:46,775
My daughter's in a bad way,
I can't even see it.

1138
01:36:55,217 --> 01:36:59,460
Sorry, I'm all messed up,
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1139
01:37:00,050 --> 01:37:02,806
It's all new to me, I feel alive.

1140
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:06,600
Yes, that encounter
was a big deal for me.

1141
01:37:07,342 --> 01:37:10,141
Yes, I'm rediscovering
the contours of my body,

1142
01:37:10,175 --> 01:37:12,362
the smell of lipstick...

1143
01:37:12,425 --> 01:37:14,000
Isn't that allowed?

1144
01:37:15,883 --> 01:37:18,421
Would you rather I cried all the time?

1145
01:37:18,467 --> 01:37:20,129
Well, I cry all the time.

1146
01:37:20,675 --> 01:37:22,644
And sometimes I laugh as well.

1147
01:37:25,383 --> 01:37:27,527
I can see you can't stand it.

1148
01:37:30,967 --> 01:37:33,417
I don't know myself anymore either.

1149
01:37:35,175 --> 01:37:37,713
I don't know what's happening to me.

1150
01:37:37,758 --> 01:37:40,865
I'm both sad... and happy.

1151
01:37:42,258 --> 01:37:43,483
Strange, isn't it?

1152
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,856
But I think I like it.

1153
01:37:50,508 --> 01:37:52,258
It scares you, doesn't it?

1154
01:37:53,383 --> 01:37:57,233
My loves, if it scares you,
then I'll stop everything.

1155
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,157
But I don't want to.

1156
01:38:57,883 --> 01:39:01,033
