Twenty years later

9
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,078
Moron!
Watch where you put your hooves!

10
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,029
You're useless!
Do you have shit for brains?

11
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,194
How can you swallow that?

12
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,230
You'd eat anything!

13
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,189
Exactly.

14
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,037
Anybody here?

15
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,150
Miss, your bricks order.

16
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,037
She looks strange.
Let's deliver and leave immediately.

17
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,190
Those flowers are magnificent.

18
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,196
They smell good.
What is it?

19
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,195
I'll go.

20
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,038
What is this coffin doing here?

21
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,235
It stinks!

22
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,196
Peasants, build a grave with these bricks.

23
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,236
It's not included in our service.

24
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,076
Move away!
Keep your distance.

25
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,996
Uncle Ping, how do you feel?

26
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,195
What's going on?

27
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,230
Those good smelling flowers are poisonous.

28
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,191
Their poison is lethalin high quantity.

29
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,117
So I'm sentenced to die!

30
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,071
Do you want the antidote?

31
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,116
Then get to work!

32
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,115
Careful!

33
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,996
I didn't touch!

34
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,076
It's not my fault.

35
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,993
I tried to warn you.

36
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,078
We call it
"using a retard as bait".

37
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,235
Sorry?

38
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,072
Hiding poison on a retard

39
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,994
and unleashing it when
he's near the target.

40
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,190
This retard is used as bait.

41
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,150
And this retard is you.

42
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,191
What a good explanation, miss!

43
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,075
Get to work!

44
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,071
Master Mojing

45
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,075
supper time.

46
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,110
Don't drink or eat anything she cooks.

47
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,031
Really tasty.

48
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,237
You're not only very beautiful
but you're also a great cook.

49
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,156
Quiet or I'll make you stop talking.

50
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,031
Alright.

51
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,038
Who uttered such a horrible scream?

52
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,071
The dwarf has been
poisoned by my flowers.

53
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,152
He'll scream to death without my antidote.

54
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,117
What about me, why don't I scream?

55
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,031
Uncle Ping, what's going on?

56
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,037
What are you doing?

57
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,152
Why him?

58
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,997
Why not me?

59
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,999
The antidote was in the meal.
You made the right choice.

60
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,236
That's why the meal was so good.

61
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,195
Miss,

62
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,072
please give me the antidote
to save Uncle Ping.

63
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,229
I put it in the rice.

64
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,231
He deserved it.

65
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,033
You're very kind,
I have to thank you.

66
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,999
I'd like to make
your grave unforgettable.

67
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,157
What a shame, something is missing.

68
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,155
What?

69
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,074
Some pig urine.
Mixed with cement

70
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,230
it would make the grave stronger

71
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,031
and it also protects from insects.

72
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,158
I'll help you get some urine.

73
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,195
Where is it?

74
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,075
What?

75
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,231
Do you know where it is?

76
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,196
I'd like to know.

77
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,149
I'll get the urine myself.

78
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,152
Give me your urine or I'll poison you.

79
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,036
Good night, miss.

80
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,237
Why didn't you hit his girl?

81
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,037
It's not my style.

82
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,231
Yeah, right!
You've been seduced by this nuisance,

83
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,032
- you dirty pig!
- Me?

84
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,075
Buddha,

85
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,073
my husband will be beaten to death!

86
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,076
Pray to ask for his help!

87
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,038
Out of the way!
There's nothing to see!

88
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,038
You're really nuts!

89
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,232
Your son admitted that he ate
young master Fung's goose.

90
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,156
We didn't accuse you without evidence.

91
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,075
Buddha, help my son!

92
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,232
Son, did you eat the goose?

93
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,189
Speak.

94
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,109
Eat what?

95
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,196
I ate...

96
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,029
A goose!

97
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,229
We didn't accuse him without evidence.

98
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,998
We lost a goose. The father
is punished for his son.

99
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,150
Theft is sentenced to death here.

100
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,073
Darling,
accept your miserable fate!

101
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,113
Is there any goose remains in his belly?
Look!

102
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,070
Blood!

103
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,237
It's not goose!

104
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,156
They're just snails!

105
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,112
He secretly ate some!
I didn't know about it!

106
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,031
Buddha,

107
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,071
see by yourself.

108
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,158
He didn't eat some goose,
but only some snails!

109
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,149
Faster!

110
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,231
Buddha, you're divine,
give us justice!

111
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,031
I travelled a long way to come here

112
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,078
to offer them some phoenix meat.

113
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,032
But Fung stole it and ate it.

114
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,072
Buddha, help us to give justice.

115
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,155
You want to get me?

116
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,117
Watch your tongue!

117
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,034
Our young master didn't steal your meat.

118
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,071
Do you agree with me?

119
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,237
My friends, phoenix meat is an
exquisite meal coming from Heaven.

120
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,157
I'll gut him to prove his guilt.

121
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,155
Father, help!

122
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,110
Please, I beg you.

123
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,072
Master Fung,
sorry for being late.

124
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,229
I'm really sorry.

125
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,152
I'll send some men right away
to settle this matter.

126
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,999
Peasant, you're guilty of
kidnapping and blackmail.

127
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,195
Don't you know the Law?

128
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,199
He's just trying to get
the land of this couple.

129
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,152
The victim's wife lost her mind
and their son dead.

130
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,074
You're a Magistrate, but you're
also an accomplice of this man.

131
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,072
You'll be decapitated first.

132
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,076
Lock him up and strike him
twenty times with a stick.

133
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,189
I lost an ear!

134
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,190
Father, he cut my ear!

135
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,115
It's me,

136
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,156
it's mine!

137
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,190
How lucky I am!
Too bad for you! Take it back.

138
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,110
Unworthy son,

139
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,038
two precious items have disappeared
from my library.

140
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,112
You stole them, didn't you?

141
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,030
No, father. I borrowed them to
admire them. I'll bring them back.

142
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,112
I want the original ones back.

143
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,119
Don't make fun of your father
with mimicries.

144
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,198
Your mother died too soon.

145
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,189
Poor boy!

146
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,110
Perfect landing.

147
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,991
Why are you defending

148
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,992
such miserable people?

149
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,192
15 years ago, on New Year's eve,
uncle Ping and I

150
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,036
were starving and sick.

151
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,038
This man helped us and gave us shelter.

152
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,032
He gave us the only cake he had.

153
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,078
Such a good deed deserves recognition.

154
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,071
Do you understand, Mr. Fung?

155
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,033
A man with principles is valorous.

156
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,110
Oh, no!

157
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,156
On your knees, scoundrel,

158
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,998
and bow down ten times.

159
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,110
Uncle Ping.

160
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,990
Bow down quickly.

161
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,115
He tried to bite my foot!

162
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,994
I would have never imagined that
such a beautiful horse could exist.

163
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,118
Was she a goddess
who came down to Earth?

164
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,111
Why did she take my bag?

165
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,993
Be victorious, Mr. Chu!

166
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,029
Safe travel, master.
Honor our school at the tournament.

167
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,195
Just my luck!

168
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,155
Who's there?

169
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,109
There are bad omens around you.
You're probably gonna die.

170
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,033
Give me your school emblem

171
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,156
and let me take your place.

172
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,115
Foolish woman,

173
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,072
how dare you talk to me like that?

174
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,190
In less than a week,

175
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,112
I forced the leaders of the
Eight Immortals, the Mohaus,

176
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,034
the Waitos and
the Thunders schools

177
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,189
to let me take their place.

178
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,029
Here are the emblems

179
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,189
of those four schools.

180
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,037
Come get some, fatso.

181
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,109
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

182
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,069
Come here.

183
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,077
My poor darling!
What's happening to you?

184
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,110
Your face is all swollen.
Does it hurt?

185
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,110
Yes!

186
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,118
This place is bad luck.
I'm outta here.

187
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,149
Tai lo.

188
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,235
You dirty Wu!

189
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,029
Miss,

190
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,031
how do you know my name?

191
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,232
Another dirty trick! And stop
staring at me like that.

192
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,195
Let go of me.

193
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,028
Sorry. I'm not as frivolous
as you think.

194
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,111
Don't always trust appearances.

195
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,116
I'll make the introductions.

196
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,191
They're friends of Mr. Chu.

197
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,077
This one is Fire Ghost Cho Mang.

198
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:20,039
And this one is Water Snake Tsui.

199
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,159
They're the ones who attacked you,
not me.

200
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,076
Give me the antidote to save my horse.

201
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,110
Your horse is cured, miss.

202
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,151
Can we go?

203
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,158
Give me your weapons.

204
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,117
I have one principle in life:

205
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,076
I only kill one man a day.

206
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,156
Did you kill one today?

207
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,992
Not yet.

208
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:14,113
Today, one of you must die.

209
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,116
But if I randomly kill one of you,

210
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,112
it won't be fair for the other.

211
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,988
I want you to duel.

212
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,231
Heaven will decide on your fate.

213
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,110
I'll start counting.
Get ready, one,

214
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,116
two,

215
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,189
three...

216
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,069
Stop it.

217
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,072
I'm in a good mood
You're free to go.

218
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,998
- Are you alright?
- Out of my way!

219
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,071
You attacked me like a traitor.

220
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,036
Why are looking at me?
Get lost!

221
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,149
Don't forget to wear something

222
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,117
more decent.

223
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,149
You're indecent!

224
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,192
It was just an advice.
Don't take it wrong.

225
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,116
What's your name?

226
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,189
My surname is Yuen,

227
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,071
and my first name is Tiyi.

228
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,073
Tiyi means "Purple Suit".
So with some green,

229
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,031
would you change your first name?

230
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,196
And what about you?

231
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,155
Wu Ne'er-Do-Weli?

232
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,036
My name is Wu Fei.

233
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,157
Fei has two meanings.
The first one is "Impure Thought",

234
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,231
the second is

235
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,116
"Without Elegance".

236
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,076
A snake bit me!

237
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,038
Where?
Don't move, I'll have a look.

238
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,235
You covered with mud.

239
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,190
You had it coming,
you dirty Fei Without Elegance.

240
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,117
Fine. If that's how you're taking it
then you're gonna get some too.

241
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,149
Stay where you are!

242
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,150
What if we played?

243
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,231
I'll ignore you forever if
you get any closer.

244
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,236
So what?
We barely know each other.

245
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,189
What are you doing?

246
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,994
Enjoy your bath!

247
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,077
Yuen Tiyi.

248
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,030
I'm coming!

249
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,229
Rape!

250
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,077
- Stay there!
- Maniac!

251
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,037
Look!

252
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,069
Don't miss that!

253
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,038
Buy a watermelon, it's cheap!

254
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,116
They're very tasty.
Do you want me to cut them open?

255
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,155
Why are you still following me?

256
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,031
The only thing you deserve is a kick.

257
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,033
Kick him!

258
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,035
Why so many watermelons?

259
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,998
I'm making a soup especially for you.

260
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,075
Are these blankets

261
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,156
for me too?

262
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,189
It's a secret.

263
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,112
Don't look at me like that
or I'll get angry!

264
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,155
Tiyi,

265
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:36,069
did you come from so far
just to challenge

266
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,229
a few schools?

267
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,118
General Fook is organizing a
martial arts tournament in Nanjing.

268
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,239
He's trying to divide us and
to make us kill each other

269
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,031
so we forget to hunt the Manchus.

270
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,192
My master asked me to thwart his plans.

271
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,192
You're doing it for the right cause.

272
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,996
I misjudged you.

273
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:06,029
The master also advised me
to find some allies.

274
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,071
You're thinking of me?

275
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,236
When i read the manual of your
ancestors techniques

276
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,190
I learned that you were the son
of the famous warrior Wu.

277
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,997
You're flattering me.

278
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,195
But i really am his son.

279
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,190
I'm offering you this jade phoenix
as compensation

280
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,155
for reading this manual.

281
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,237
I also bought you these clothes.

282
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,076
She's trying to get my attention...

283
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,116
by buying me nice clothes

284
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,993
and offering me a jade jewel.

285
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,236
There's no doubt about it,
she likes me.

286
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,153
We're alone under the rain,
in an abandonned temple.

287
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,237
I'm not stupid enough to not
understand your intentions.

288
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,152
But I'm the son of a famous family.

289
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,110
I can't soil my father's name.

290
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,069
What can I do?

291
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,150
Does it mean that
it doesn't bother him?

292
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,992
I got the message.

293
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,116
I salute you.

294
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,069
Not bad at all.
Now you're worthy of me.

295
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,231
You have good taste.

296
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,155
Why those tears?

297
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,152
It's the first time

298
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,231
that someone gives me a present.

299
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,035
The rice will burn!

300
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,998
It doesn't matter.

301
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,150
Let me do it.

302
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,150
What is it?

303
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,230
Rice coated with caramel,
it's my specialty.

304
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,992
Give it a try.

305
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,071
Excuse me.

306
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,076
I can't hold any longer.

307
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,076
He's smillng again...

308
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,072
I can't resist...
It's so exciting...

309
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,111
Enough.

310
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,988
I must kick him to stop him...

311
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,155
Father, help!

312
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,231
- Father.
- Young master.

313
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,078
This savage followed us here.

314
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,190
But he's wearing new clothes.
He looks rich now.

315
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,071
My boy,

316
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,190
you only have bad manners.

317
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,235
It doesn't bother me.
But you seduced my concubine,

318
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,079
and you're spending too much time her.
It's not decent.

319
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,118
I won't touch her anymore.

320
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,191
Don't cry.

321
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,149
Peasant,

322
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,028
I appreciate your efforts
to get dressed properly.

323
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,196
Thank you, I almost forgot
to change clothes.

324
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,157
It mustn't be soiled.
It's a gift from my dear wife.

325
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,116
She'll be a widow tonight.

326
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,151
Really?

327
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,231
Isn't it your son who will
prepare your funeral?

328
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,031
How lucky, it's not my ass!

329
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,078
Do you like this watermelon?

330
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,031
Not bad, darling!

331
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,075
Those are even better.

332
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,109
Caramel?

333
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,152
- Father!
- What are you doing, young master?

334
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,998
- I'm putting out the fire.
- But it's oil!

335
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,997
- Don't move.
- Move away!

336
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,993
My master forbade me to kill
during the mission.

337
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,196
How are you related?

338
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,235
Thank you for saving my life.

339
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,110
Have we met before?

340
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,232
Does my face look familiar?

341
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:14,112
I must give you a letter.

342
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,156
Chek, give something to write.

343
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,237
This letter explains everything.

344
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,391
Only the members of the Poison school

345
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:16,429
can soak paper fibres with poison.

346
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,511
This poison irritates

347
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,313
the eyes.

348
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,359
The victim ends pulling his eyes out.

349
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,556
His muscles decay before he dies.

350
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,555
Only the members of the
school have the antidote.

351
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:38,358
Does your master know where they are?

352
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,399
They have many enemies and keep moving.

353
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,439
Their leader is hidden
in a secret place.

354
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,515
His name is Mojing.

355
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,435
Mojing?

356
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,470
How do you do?
Aren't you watering your flowers?

357
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,470
What are you doing?

358
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,472
I'll tell you!

359
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,397
Don't come any closer!

360
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,355
Stay away!

361
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,429
Listen!

362
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,439
I noticed that you didn't have
enough materials the last time

363
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,478
so I bought some especially for you.

364
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,516
I can help you build the most
beautiful grave.

365
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,518
It took you a month to find all this?

366
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,475
No,

367
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,438
but it's a long and hard trip.

368
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,314
My donkey is slow.

369
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,479
I brought you some watermelons
and some caramel.

370
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,398
What else did you bring?

371
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,359
Since I was delayed, I brought
a friend to help us.

372
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,436
Last time it was a lame person
and now a blind woman.

373
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:16,472
She got blind after
she promised to help you.

374
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,479
I heard there's no cure for her eyes.
What can I do?

375
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,398
It's nothing.
She'll be cured in a few days.

376
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,391
Help me.

377
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,395
Stop!

378
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,550
- You're getting too familiar.
- No...

379
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,318
I won't do it again.
Help me.

380
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,437
She's been poisoned

381
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,357
three days ago.

382
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,471
She's been unconscious for half a day.

383
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,353
She'll die in six hours
without care.

384
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,476
This wagon is perfect
to carry her body.

385
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,397
I'm just in time.

386
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,391
Do you want to save her?

387
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,477
Claw her eyes out and she'll live.

388
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,353
Are you kidding? She's useless
if she remains blind.

389
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,433
I'll work and you'll cure her.

390
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,319
I anticipated everything.
I brought some of my pig's urine.

391
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,435
You've got a nerve!

392
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,431
You got me the last time.

393
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,431
Does it smell good?

394
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,317
I feel good.

395
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,470
Now we're even.

396
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,318
Let's get to work.

397
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,430
It scratches!
What's going on?

398
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:04,479
I put a poison in the urine.

399
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,357
What's happening to me?

400
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,471
You will look like a pig.

401
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,511
- A pig?
- Have a look in the water.

402
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,515
Who are you?

403
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,549
I'm changing into a pig!

404
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,352
Well, I wanted to put on some weight.

405
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,550
You got your revenge.
Now, save her.

406
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,469
Say "pig" three times.

407
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,391
I'm a pig,
I'm a pig,

408
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,515
I'm a pig.

409
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,437
I have to know if she's your fiancée!

410
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,559
If it's not the case then
she has nothing to do with you.

411
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,395
Why should I save her?

412
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,391
She's the woman of my life.

413
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,471
Help her by any means necessary.

414
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,398
- Why should I help my enemy?
- Your enemy?

415
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,437
She's my rival.

416
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,549
Sorry?

417
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,516
I barely know you!

418
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,355
How dare you reject me!

419
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,398
No! I'm going out with you,
not with her!

420
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,475
Miss,

421
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,476
I'll do anything you want.

422
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,429
Her time is coming.

423
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,552
I'll cure her if
you grant me three wishes.

424
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,471
I haven't decided yet,

425
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:30,431
I'll tell you later.

426
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,556
There's something
I'd like to tell you.

427
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,429
What is it?

428
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:40,512
Is it a present?

429
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,515
Yes.

430
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,356
It's ugly.

431
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,515
We're back, come out!

432
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,311
My brother and my sister in arms.

433
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:01,314
If she doesn't get
the cure now, she'll die.

434
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,470
Cure her and I'll drive them away.

435
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,437
Are you crazy?

436
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,550
They're poison experts.

437
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,352
We must find something,
they're already here.

438
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,519
I burned all your flowers.

439
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:40,358
Surrender immediately.

440
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,555
Give us the master manual.

441
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,475
Moyung,

442
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,391
Sit Hei.

443
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,396
Master, you're still alive?

444
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,470
I faked death,

445
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,516
knowing that you had bad intentions.

446
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:20,519
You're not wasting time to
steal the manual.

447
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,357
I, Kotai keung,
salute the Great Master.

448
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,516
Kotai keung?

449
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,312
Aren't you strong?

450
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,550
Great Master,
I used to be as my name suggests it,

451
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,554
big and strong.

452
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,396
Unfortunately, they took me by force
as one of their students

453
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,472
and they're using me
to test their poisons.

454
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:44,314
I'm shrinking everyday.
You must help me

455
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,356
and purify your school.

456
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,437
I knew that you wanted to kill me!
Help, Master!

457
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:08,314
You'd go as far as getting rid
of your disciple.

458
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,473
I must eliminate you without delay.

459
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:16,439
- Give us a chance!
- We won't do it again.

460
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,398
Shut up!
Let me talk!

461
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,510
I'll spare your lives

462
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,356
since you admit your faults.

463
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,398
Take a sword.

464
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,512
Cut off your left hand
with your right hand,

465
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,312
then both of your legs.

466
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,511
Then,

467
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:53,352
you'll cut off

468
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,396
the remaining hand one another.

469
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,557
Master... as you wish!

470
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,510
You're an impostor!
I'm screwed!

471
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,395
I'll help you.

472
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,391
He won't stop swelling.

473
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,429
It hurts!

474
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,436
How do you feel?

475
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,437
Do you want to get your original size back?
Your wish is granted.

476
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,554
It hurts!

477
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,475
Finally, I got my body back!

478
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,431
Move, peasant.

479
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,395
Stop looking at her!

480
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,510
Do you think she's beautiful?
Piss off!

481
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,469
What?

482
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,352
- What is it?
- Poisoned urine.

483
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,395
- Your chest...
- Poison.

484
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,395
I'll heal you.

485
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:32,393
No. People must know that she's
the one who attacked me.

486
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,435
Really?

487
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,351
Don't touch it. It's corrosive.

488
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,469
Go get a wok!

489
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,310
It's huge!

490
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,355
You dirty voyeur!

491
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,470
I won't hold much longer!

492
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,555
Go through the roof, stupid.

493
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,312
Don't complain if everything collapses.

494
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,430
What a dirty work!

495
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,435
Careful.

496
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,318
Stay behind me.

497
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,391
Don't say a word. Don't move.

498
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:17,473
It's the fiancé of our little
sister in arms.

499
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,429
What is this poison?

500
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,357
Don't panic.

501
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,475
It's only caramel.

502
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,351
Delicious.

503
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:44,351
It's been a while since I ate some.

504
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,475
- I love it.
- It's great.

505
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,435
I was keeping the best for the end.

506
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,395
Yunnan wasps!

507
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,312
I told you not to move.

508
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,550
You were in danger,
so I intervened.

509
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,477
In danger?
Touch me to find out.

510
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:17,469
Does it burn?

511
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,557
I'm covered with flammable powder,
you moron!

512
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,510
I learned another thing.

513
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,311
How is miss Yuen doing?

514
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,550
You should worry about
your fate instead.

515
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:33,478
Look at your hands.

516
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,432
My brother in arms poisoned you.

517
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:41,478
- What shall I do?
- Cut off your hands.

518
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,509
Dinner is ready!

519
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:05,348
Ling, it's fried fish.

520
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,429
I see...

521
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:12,557
Too heavy on the stomach!
I'll prepare some, steamed.

522
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:14,315
No.

523
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:19,517
Rice is ready.

524
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,436
It's perfumed.

525
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,477
You have no appetite.
I'll make you a seafood soup.

526
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,430
Wu Fei,

527
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,316
come here.

528
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,311
Wait for me.

529
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:40,478
What do you want? There's some seafood,
some clams and some pigeon.

530
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,437
What do you prefer?

531
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,429
I like everything.

532
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,353
Who is the prettiest?
Me or her?

533
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:53,512
Beauty is subjective.
Everybody has different tastes.

534
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:57,439
There are many beauties:
Inner beauty, outside look,

535
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,398
beauty with or without make-up.

536
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,359
Environment and climate
have an influence on beauty.

537
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,392
Weather reports count too.

538
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,438
Beauty and intelligence are
equally important.

539
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,516
Intelligence matters even more.

540
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,438
You're very intelligent.

541
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,391
Who is the most beautiful?

542
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,391
You are the most beautiful.

543
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,438
Repeat it louder.

544
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,398
Do you remember the three wishes?

545
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,389
Firstly,

546
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,519
I want you to stay with me forever.

547
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:13,512
Can you keep this first promise?

548
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,391
Yes.

549
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:18,517
Secondly,
you must leave Yuen Tiyi.

550
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:25,315
And finally,
you'll never see her again.

551
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:32,510
I knew that you wouldn't be able
to keep your promise.

552
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,512
Remember to not promise anything.

553
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:43,473
Don't worry,
forget what I just said.

554
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,349
Yes,

555
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,311
I'll remember.

556
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,515
Miss Yuen,

557
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,437
Here are the clothes and the jade
you offered me.

558
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,356
I give them back.

559
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,398
I'm the son of the Warrior Wu,

560
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:10,354
Descendant of an important family.
I have principles to respect.

561
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,476
You won't let me kill my enemy,

562
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:14,509
so you're becoming my enemy.

563
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,352
Our ways part here.

564
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,554
I won't stand in your way anymore.

565
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:28,439
In fact,
I hate him more than you do.

566
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,516
I must kill him.

567
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:34,438
I'm afraid I don't understand...

568
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:37,437
Twenty years ago,

569
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,393
at Nanking, a fisherman had
a daughter named Ngan.

570
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:45,472
One day when she was delivering
fish to Fung,

571
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,439
this monster raped her.

572
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,436
She got pregnant.

573
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:58,428
Feeling pity for Ngan,
an employee of the fish-shop married her.

574
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,470
Who dares touch my women?

575
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:06,318
He went to the village with his men.

576
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,549
They killed all the guests

577
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,351
at the wedding.

578
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,516
My mother couldn't endure it.

579
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:18,399
She abandonned me and killed herself.

580
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,470
My master took me with him

581
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,437
and taught me how to fight.

582
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:31,516
I came back to get revenge.

583
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:35,351
In this case,

584
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:40,314
why did you stop me
from killing him?

585
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:46,558
He's my father after all.

586
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,471
He gave me life.

587
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:53,397
I saved him once to pay my debt.

588
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,314
But now I'll avenge my mother
by killing him.

589
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,389
Tiyi,

590
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,351
I was wrong about you.

591
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,515
I'll come with you,
let's go.

592
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:11,352
I'll tell Ling to come with us.

593
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,392
Ling, it's a tragedy.

594
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,438
Her story is very sad.

595
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,472
So what?
Mine ain't any better!

596
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,358
Why do you ignore me?

597
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,557
You also endured a tragedy?
Tell me.

598
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,555
No way.

599
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,351
I also have a miserable past...

600
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,471
and nobody cares.

601
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,556
It's not as bad as mine.

602
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:44,509
Well, since we have that in common,
let's help one another.

603
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,476
We'll make a big family.

604
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:50,357
In fact, I'd like...

605
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:54,353
I know! You want me to be
your little sister!

606
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:58,308
No, you're two months older.
You're the big sister.

607
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,510
I want you to marry me
and be my slave!

608
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:04,509
Your slave!

609
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,349
Miss Ching.

610
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,517
Thank you for saving my life.

611
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,476
- I'm offering you the second phoenix.
- I don't want it!

612
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,472
I don't need any of
your thanks or presents.

613
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:23,473
"We neighbours should help each other out",
that's what my master told me.

614
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,316
Miss Ching,

615
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,392
these phoenix are a couple.

616
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:32,430
I give you Wu Fei.

617
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,549
Why should we get to that?

618
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,512
Why should we break up?

619
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,515
Darling,

620
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:55,513
come to eat!
It's getting cold!

621
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,517
I told you that he was ugly,
why do you keep him?

622
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,389
Look!

623
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,556
I bought you a lot of other clothes.

624
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:11,432
Do you like it? Look!

625
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,549
Wu Fei!

626
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,437
Fei!

627
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,312
Bastard, motherfucker, scumbag...

628
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,391
asshole, son of a...

629
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,471
Come back!

630
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:36,511
Come back or I'll poison the river!

631
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:41,348
May I never see you again,
or else,

632
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:43,476
I swear that

633
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,512
I'll poison you for good.

634
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,469
Forgive me.

635
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,317
I'm sorry,

636
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,391
my master is a monk.

637
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,510
I follow his way.

638
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,517
I dress like that when I travel.

639
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,351
I don't want to lie to you again.

640
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,469
Eat.

641
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,557
- I don't want it.
- Don't you like spices?

642
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,550
It's not strong enough.

643
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,395
What about some poison?

644
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,351
It's very spicy, do you want some?

645
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,550
Don't worry, I have the antidote.

646
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,395
Darling,

647
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,516
my heart is making me suffer
since a long time.

648
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,396
I decided to sacrifice myself.

649
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,516
She'll be bride,
I'll be the concubine.

650
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,352
You must feel happier.
Smile!

651
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,476
Do something.

652
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,516
Smile or I'll poison you!

653
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,519
Enough!
Who would want a woman like you?

654
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,477
You're only talking of poisoning
your husband! You're unpleassant!

655
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,397
When it comes to happiness,
that's not it!

656
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:08,431
Forgive me,
I won't do it again.

657
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:13,479
Listen, I promise that I'll never
poison you ever again.

658
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,475
May I die if I do it again.

659
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:17,391
Then keep your word.

660
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,356
You're watching another girl?

661
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,431
I'm gonna...

662
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:37,352
Young master, be careful.

663
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,549
An enemy.

664
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,316
I'll watch him.

665
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,471
Why so much excitement?

666
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,557
Add four jade coins on my
father's hat.

667
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:05,399
Young master, it would make
the hat look ridiculous.

668
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,432
This old man dares challenge
me for a girl!

669
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,431
There are many other concubines!

670
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:14,359
This girl with the big boobs is mine!

671
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,390
Come on!

672
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,351
Wonderful!

673
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,395
Come here.

674
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,555
I want to sabotage the tournament.
And you?

675
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,357
I'm here to marry you.

676
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:50,513
Let's ask your master
the permission to marry.

677
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,510
We'll run away and
lead a cloistered life

678
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,351
if he refuses.

679
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,557
Even if we are sentenced to death

680
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,437
by drowning...

681
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:04,395
I don't care.

682
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,313
Stop! You're the devil!

683
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,389
- I'm not the devil!
- You are!

684
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,357
- No!
- Yes, you are!

685
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,549
No, I'm not the devil.

686
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,515
I come from a great family.

687
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,357
That's enough!

688
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:19,393
I'll throw you downstairs
if you insist!

689
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,515
I don't believe you.

690
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,436
What does this smile mean?

691
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:28,438
Stop it!

692
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,317
Stop smiling like that!

693
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,472
My dear, it's my way of smiling
since I'm a child.

694
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:39,518
You're the one still tied
to the pleasures of this world.

695
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,516
You're really indecent for a nun.

696
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,389
Me?

697
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,351
I'm must take hold of myself.

698
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,472
Stop tempting me!

699
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,429
Do you want to kiss me?

700
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,435
No!

701
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:04,476
I'll get angry if you kiss me...

702
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,356
If you kiss me...

703
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,469
Don't kiss me...

704
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,351
I can't hold any longer...
Kiss me...

705
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,357
Do it or I'll get angry!

706
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:02,395
Let's part.

707
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,549
Alright.

708
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,510
- Why?
- That's true, why?

709
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,393
We sinned.

710
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:16,312
Let's part to avoid a scandal.

711
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,549
Let's go our own ways.

712
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:23,397
Take these emblems with you.
I must go.

713
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:24,515
Take care.

714
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:38,398
Damn, we're two,

715
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:41,392
to love the same man.
What are you trying to do?

716
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,476
I don't have to justify myself.

717
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,510
It's all my fault.
What do you want?

718
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:51,512
Enough talk.
Let's fight.

719
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,318
You're gonna lose without poison.

720
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,437
I don't need any poison against you.

721
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:03,353
It's too expensive.

722
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:06,398
I'll crush you like a bug.

723
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,475
I won't use any!

724
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,517
Using poison is out of the question!

725
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,396
Out of the question!

726
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:33,475
Let's make peace.

727
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,509
It's my fault,

728
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,316
since the beginning.

729
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,472
I'm warning you,
I don't want to see you again.

730
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,312
I'll punish you if we meet again!

731
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,515
Why are they looking at me...

732
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:03,510
Would people of the capital city
be aware of my relationship...

733
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,476
What?

734
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:12,435
Little bitch!

735
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,357
Here I am.

736
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,391
Why don't you sleep?

737
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,549
Still working?

738
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,436
I bought you some Peking duck.

739
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,436
I'm sure you'll like it.

740
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:45,394
How brave!
You're testing a poison on your face?

741
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,475
You idiot!

742
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,352
Is it the famous manual of your master?

743
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,516
Don't touch it!
It's poisoned.

744
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,518
You'll die in two hours
once you're infected.

745
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,389
It's almost finished.

746
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,475
I'll light another.

747
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:17,393
Don't light it!
There's some poison on it too.

748
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,439
This lethal flower must be
pourred with wine.

749
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:30,352
Is wine also some kind of poison?

750
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,314
Tiyi gave me two emblems.

751
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:50,473
She's inviting us at the tournament.
How will we disguise ourselves?

752
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,557
Also, she's asking when you'll
be available

753
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:00,477
for a good meal.

754
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:07,439
No way.
She won't be your wife!

755
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,511
She won't even be your concubine!

756
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,472
I'm keeping you for me alone!
You've got no say in this matter!

757
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:22,352
This wine is poisoned!
You broke your word!

758
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:25,470
Don't be ridiculous!

759
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,310
But this wine...

760
01:20:27,400 --> 01:20:31,359
I pourred a good dose of laxative
to wash your stomach.

761
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,431
Three days on the bog
and you'll be as good as new.

762
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,469
You're heartless!

763
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:40,310
Why are you yelling at me?
Are you looking for a fight?

764
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,435
The bog!

765
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,358
Are you afraid to fight?
Fucking coward!

766
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:49,348
You thought you could get out like that.
At each infidelity

767
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:51,396
your punishment will be the same.

768
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,431
Here's general Fook.

769
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,317
General.

770
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:19,515
Bring the wine.

771
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,355
Bring the wine.

772
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:29,354
Thank you for coming from so far.

773
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,472
Please, drink this cup of wine.

774
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,511
Don't drink it.
It's poisoned.

775
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:49,357
It's okay.
Swallow this pill.

776
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,476
They're with my brother-in-arms...

777
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:08,551
Not easy to get rid of him...
Do you remember my advice?

778
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,476
I'm staying with you, not a word,
not a move.

779
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:14,515
You deserve a kiss.

780
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:19,399
Gentlemen, accidents can happen
during a tournament.

781
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,397
Out of kindness,
general Fook

782
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:26,389
chose the one who will be
the leader of all schools.

783
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,438
It will be Mr. Fung nam-tin.

784
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:31,391
Mr. Fung.

785
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,356
He deserves our respect.

786
01:22:37,480 --> 01:22:39,471
He's the best person for this position.

787
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,551
Who ever thinks he's better than me

788
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,471
can come to challenge me.

789
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:56,512
I'm not afraid of your sword.
I'll throw you out of here!

790
01:22:58,440 --> 01:22:59,509
Wait, Mr. Chan.

791
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:02,430
What? Don't you believe me?

792
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:05,398
Mr. Chan, these muscles
will be useless.

793
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:07,351
My fists are invincible!

794
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,352
You fell into their trap.

795
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,351
There's some poison in the wine.

796
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:13,429
What?

797
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,549
Defend your honor!

798
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,430
Only the master of Shaolin
can measure up to Fung.

799
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,397
Go, Master.

800
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,391
Let's fight, Master.

801
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:43,393
They've all been poisoned without knowing.

802
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:46,552
This smoke will cure you.

803
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,317
How do you feel?

804
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:53,516
Why are you following me?

805
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:57,353
You ordered me to stay with me.

806
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:00,512
You finally notice my qualities.

807
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:02,549
Give me a kiss.

808
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,350
Fags...

809
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:19,395
Master.

810
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,389
How do you feel?

811
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,476
My name is Wu To,
I'd like to fight you.

812
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,435
Shit...

813
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:28,554
Can I borrow your staff?

814
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:33,398
It's the sacred staff
of our ancestor Dhama...

815
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,390
Thank you.

816
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,356
Sir...

817
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,516
Mr. Fung, let's go.

818
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,516
It's you, peasant!

819
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:44,509
Exactly.

820
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:48,397
Master Yuen Tiyi, representing

821
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:51,392
thirteen and a half schools, is coming.

822
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:13,552
No need to show the world
your real identity.

823
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,356
Why?

824
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:39,393
This point is coated with a deadly poison.
Go cure him quickly!

825
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:45,477
No need to worry.
It's only poison.

826
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:50,433
Don't mind me or my husband.

827
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,516
I'm not here for the tournament.

828
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,431
I'm here to warn you.

829
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,509
Beware of Fung.

830
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:04,310
You!

831
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:08,553
You made a pact with the rebels
against the general.

832
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:15,353
I heard you speak with the rebels.

833
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:18,392
You pretend to serve the general

834
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:21,398
to able to capture him.

835
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,351
Do you have any proof?

836
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:29,397
It's in his hat.

837
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:32,438
Would you dare to show your hat

838
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,311
to the general?

839
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:47,433
General, it's a letter from
the leader of the rebels.

840
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:51,394
My father always obeyed your orders.
He's not your enemy!

841
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:57,558
It would seem that he also didn't
poison the guests.

842
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,391
Do you have an explanation?

843
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:09,350
General, it's a plot!
She set up this trap!

844
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:13,513
For many years I've been
hunting rebels for you.

845
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:21,437
General, she... She's my daughter!

846
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:25,513
i raped her mother.
She's trying to get revenge.

847
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,556
What?
May Buddha bless her soul.

848
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,356
What is this stupid story?

849
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:36,350
Get him.

850
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,312
Don't spare anyone.

851
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,435
Father, help!

852
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,352
Great, no need to fight for you anymore!

853
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:14,511
I declare that Miss Yuen Tiyi

854
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,352
is the most miserable of us all.

855
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:21,398
She's really sincere when
she's leaving you to me.

856
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:26,469
I'll always be very loving
if you remain faithful to me.

857
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:30,517
I was wrong.
I shouldn't have poisoned her...

858
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:32,549
What did you do?

859
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:36,518
No! We're good friends!
It was a joke!

860
01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:40,557
Have a rest while I'll offer
her to eat with us.

861
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:45,513
Tell her that you want to be
her brother and we'll be a family.

862
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,397
It's decided.

863
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,356
- It's Mr. Chan.
- How did he die?

864
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:56,556
From a toxic silkworm.

865
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:19,389
Remember my orders.

866
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:22,396
Give me your master manual.

867
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:26,432
Okay, I'll give it to you if you
answer my question correctly.

868
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,351
I'll burn it

869
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:30,429
if you try to force me.

870
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,391
Speak.

871
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:38,517
You put some poison on his body
to poison us.

872
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,557
Why didn't you make it
impossible to detect?

873
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:46,392
It's impossible when it touches the skin.

874
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:51,473
Wrong. The manuals says it's possible.
Do you want to try?

875
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:54,349
Not good!

876
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:57,389
Master, don't listen to her!

877
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:01,433
How dare you disobey me?
Do you remember what you told me?

878
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:03,397
Master...

879
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:08,356
Here.

880
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,476
Mixing the silkworm, the crane blood
and the peacock bile

881
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,476
will get this result.

882
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,512
Show me the manual.
If there's a formula,

883
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:44,475
there must be a cure.

884
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:50,433
Sorry. There's no cure when we mix
these three poisons.

885
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,311
We must avoid using it.

886
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:02,559
i recognize my mistake...
Please give him the antidote.

887
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,396
We must save him!

888
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:06,316
Little sister!

889
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:12,435
Test it on her

890
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:14,556
and find out if there's a cure!

891
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,430
You're not hurt?

892
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:45,437
It's a good thing that I'm fast,
otherwise...

893
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,436
I told you to stay out of it...

894
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,471
What bothers me the most,

895
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:08,431
is that after my death,

896
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:14,359
you'll be alone and without family...

897
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:18,557
Fei,
I'll never let you die.

898
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,317
The manual says

899
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:26,472
that there's no antidote...

900
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,511
My master wrote it

901
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:33,472
because he didn't believe
that a doctor would

902
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:38,354
give up his own life
to save his patient.

903
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:47,433
You'll be infected too...

904
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:24,396
Don't be sad for me...

905
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:27,351
Don't feel guilty...

906
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,316
Go get Miss Yuen...

907
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,351
tell her to marry you...

908
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:40,351
I'll pray for your happiness...

909
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:43,438
In heaven...

910
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,316
Darling, can you tell me...

911
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:53,431
I love you...

912
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:57,477
Is it possible...

913
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,356
I scattered your ashes

914
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,391
on my parents grave.

915
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,351
You're part of the family.

916
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,397
From now on, you won't be alone.

917
01:34:58,400 --> 01:34:59,469
This necklace represents

918
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,469
my love for you.

919
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:03,549
It will keep you company

920
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,436
forever.

921
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,391
Ling!

922
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:49,509
Help!

923
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:19,477
General, Fung took the governor
and the nun as hostages.

924
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:20,509
He threatens to kill them.

925
01:36:22,360 --> 01:36:25,352
The weather is uncertain,
a storm is coming.

926
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,396
We'll hunt them down after the storm.

927
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,391
I'm the governor.
You have no right

928
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:41,549
to treat me like that!

929
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:02,317
Damn nun,

930
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,311
you brought me bad luck!

931
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,317
Eat!

932
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,476
How dare you bite me!

933
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:24,515
Tiyi!

934
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:35,552
Get lost, you fucking dog!

935
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,517
Don't come any closer
or I'll kill her!

936
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:17,475
That'll teach you!

937
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:02,549
Fei!

938
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:34,515
Don't kill him!

939
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:41,359
We can be his heirs.

940
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:44,472
Fifty-fifty!
I'm your brother,

941
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:47,356
try to make him see sense.

942
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:53,315
I must get the key to his chest.

943
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:13,517
My son, I always loved you.

944
01:44:14,480 --> 01:44:17,358
Why do you always betray me?

945
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:21,439
Why did you try to take my
sword and my concubines?

946
01:44:22,360 --> 01:44:24,316
Why?

947
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:26,356
Why?

948
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:45,471
Love brings sadness,

949
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:48,396
love also brings terror.

950
01:44:48,520 --> 01:44:50,511
By freeing ourselves from love,

951
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:52,554
we get away from sadness and terror.

952
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:57,397
I'll pray for Miss Ching everyday,

953
01:44:57,520 --> 01:45:01,399
I wish her happiness in heaven.

954
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:04,315
Tiyi.

955
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:07,358
Don't come any closer,
stay away.

956
01:45:08,520 --> 01:45:12,479
Don't smile at me.

957
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:15,356
Turn around, turn around quickly!

958
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:19,314
Don't watch me go.
Count to one thousand

959
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:21,475
before turning round.

960
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:29,313
One, two, three, four,

961
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:32,470
five hundred, seven hundred,
one thousand...
