1
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,370
The future of Japan will be saved by robots.

2
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,760
Lately nuclear accidents are getting common.

3
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:38,680
In the field of health and safety, the current systems
in place already show their technological limits.

4
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,330
For the benefit of our workforce, we must get over this problem at all costs.

5
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,550
I want the government and the private sector to unite

6
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:51,440
Prime Minister Tabe: Developing Robots to Recover the Japanese Economy

7
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:51,440
Broadcasting from the National Diet

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:51,440
"ARK Project"

9
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:51,440
Started

10
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,630
and commit themselves to developing the world's most advanced robot.

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,760
For this reason we've created the "ARK Project".

12
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:02,450
Special Report

13
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:02,450
ARK Project - The depiction

14
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:02,450
of Japan's future

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,180
Our ultimate goal

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,450
ARK Project Chief Researcher

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,450
Dr. Nobuhiko Komyoji

18
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,020
is to create something able to complete physical problems that humans can not solve.

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,100
An Android.

20
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,500
The end result of our research, I hope

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,850
is peace for all mankind.

22
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,280
Motor skills are almost equal.

23
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,550
But there is an evident gap in judgement speed.

24
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,490
Could this be a weakness of the "Conscience Circuit"?

25
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,970
Strangely, it tries to infer emotion from facial expressions and the current situation.

26
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,640
Clearly, this capability isn't needed in battle.

27
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,500
What are you trying to do behind my back?

28
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,190
Professor Komyoji.

29
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,470
As you can see...

30
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,400
I am testing KJX-1's and BJX-2's fighting ability.

31
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,170
Jiro!

32
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,920
Okay, that's enough.

33
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,520
My Mari possess far better fighting skills than your Jiro,

34
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,010
And I felt the need to show it to Minister Tsubakitani.

35
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,600
I do not remember having developed Jiro as a combat android.

36
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:26,870
My ARK project is strictly for peaceful purposes.

37
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,990
For starters, this lab is different from America,

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,410
where the relative merits of an android is measured in combat ability alone.

39
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,360
That in itself is an anachronism.

40
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,850
However, we scientists sometimes have to follow where the "anachronism" goes.

41
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,430
Because fish that does not follow the tide just drown.

42
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,470
So from the very start the goal has always been military applications.

43
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,940
Well, I beg to reconsider.

44
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,140
He's so naive.

45
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,880
For someone known as one of Japan's top scientists.

46
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,160
What do you intend to do?

47
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:10,450
Of course, I will try to persuade Chief Komyoji.

48
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,420
Mari.

49
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,660
You are truly man's equal.

50
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,280
And on the other hand, Jiro.

51
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:49,550
Like your creator, you are missing an important thing.

52
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,820
You are an imperfect machine.

53
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,130
I am...

54
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,250
a machine.

55
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,410
Has it been a year?

56
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,680
That year must have been unbearable.

57
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:37,040
But it seems she has never told anyone what happened to Nobuhiko.

58
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,290
Don't you think that's insensitive of them?

59
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,250
Well, that just seems like how children their age would react.

60
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,510
I heard that things aren't going well in the Nobuhiko household.

61
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,320
It's been confirmed that she'll be studying abroad, and I wonder...

62
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:57,500
what will happen to the siblings because of it?

63
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,010
By gaining intelligence, the heart changes.

64
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,860
And while the heart changes to the knowledge,

65
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,240
The body is also affected.

66
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,280
And even before that…

67
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,300
Oh. Isn't that Mitsu?

68
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,520
Mitsu!

69
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,200
Hey! How are you?

70
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,700
What's up? Only two classes today?

71
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,020
Well, my lecture for this afternoon seems to be canceled.

72
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,540
Really? What a miracle!

73
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,820
Then come with me tonight.

74
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,550
Haruna is fishing herself a boyfriend...

75
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,370
-so I need company for a group date!

76
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,680
Pretty please?

77
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,320
But I don't really go to blind dates.

78
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,160
But it's a dinner, please!

79
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,660
I'm terribly sorry but it won't happen.

80
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,940
Mitchy!

81
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,420
What?

82
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,040
Oh, now I see.

83
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,660
So is he your type?

84
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,680
What, no, no, no!

85
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,950
He's just some journalist.

86
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,490
Journalist?

87
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,850
He's been asking me about my father recently.

88
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,140
What a waste, and he's good looking too.

89
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,900
If you don't act now, you'll never get anyting in life!

90
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,290
Quit telling me that.

91
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,280
I'm quite occupied with me and my brothers stuff already.

92
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,360
See ya.

93
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,440
Mitsu!

94
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,850
Mitchy... ouchies.

95
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,180
Good afternoon!

96
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,260
Thanks.

97
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,550
Dr. Komyoji...

98
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,880
The cause of your father's death.

99
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,100
It seems that you know what really happened, Mitchy.

100
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,230
Please stop calling me that.

101
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,430
As far as I know,

102
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,070
they are still continuing the project that your father started.

103
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,210
Dr. Komyoji, world renowned for his skill in robotic engineering,

104
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,010
was reportedly killed in an accident, and yet

105
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,230
there was no news coverage and the research program continued on.

106
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,170
Do you really think it was an accidental death?

107
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,260
I have no interest in the work of that guy.

108
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,820
Here you go with "that guy" again.

109
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,400
He was a single-father right?

110
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,750
Mr. Hattori!

111
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,980
The death of that guy...

112
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:45,520
You're really interested in reporting about that incident aren't you?

113
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,750
You men are always thinking about work.

114
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,240
It isn't like that at all, Mitchy.

115
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,760
I already told you to stop calling that.

116
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,130
I have to go prepare my brother's dinner.

117
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:03,690
If you have nothing more to ask, then I'll be going now.

118
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,790
"One day, a prince mounted atop a white horse will come for me."

119
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,050
Why do girls of today cling to this hope?

120
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,360
For instance,

121
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,440
Will that man take that girl to the world of her dreams?

122
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,170
I think not.

123
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,310
As one can plainly see of the men of real life,

124
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,150
they are content with the happiness found in the phone's screen held by their hands.

125
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:42,000
They cannot see that women are waiting in the real world.

126
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:49,160
And because of that, I'd rather dream of the princes of anime and manga.

127
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,210
Because I know that in this reality,

128
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:58,890
no prince will sweep me away and take me to another world.

129
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,170
I'm back.

130
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,380
Welcome home.

131
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,530
Would you like some curry tonight?

132
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,860
You like that don't you, Masaru.

133
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,000
Are you playing games again?

134
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:31,070
Are you done with your homework?

135
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:39,640
Do you think you can handle yourself once I start studying abroad?

136
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,480
Hey Mitchy, its me, Hattori.

137
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,290
Please, let me ask a few more questions.

138
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,560
I have nothing else to say.

139
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,200
Please stop coming to my home.

140
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,090
And stop calling me that too.

141
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,470
Masaru?

142
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,000
-What are you doing here?

143
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,100
Wh-wh-what's going on?

144
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,060
Mararu!

145
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,900
Sis, help me!

146
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,360
Masaru!

147
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,150
What!? What is all this!?

148
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
Masaru!

149
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,500
Sis, I'm scared!

150
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,530
Help me sis!

151
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,440
Masaru, Masaru!

152
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,670
Sis, help me!

153
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,220
Let me go!

154
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,520
Sis!

155
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,390
Masaru!

156
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,670
I'm scared!

157
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,230
Wait!

158
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,970
I'm scared!

159
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,410
Let go!

160
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,400
That hurts, that hurts!

161
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,900
Masaru!

162
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,620
Who are you?

163
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,880
Run away, hurry.

164
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,710
I've got no choice, switch on.

165
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,880
A machine?!

166
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,980
Now I must do what a machine does.

167
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:24,640
I'm not going to continue to fight with you humans.

168
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,510
Sis.

169
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,530
Awesome!

170
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,670
Masaru.

171
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,680
What is this thing?

172
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,300
Awesome.

173
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,950
Stay back!

174
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,070
Hey, Mitchy!

175
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,010
Are you both ok?

176
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,220
Hey mister, did you see that?

177
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,920
It was so awe...

178
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,970
No, keep quiet.

179
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,120
Well I saw it more or less.

180
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,320
That guy who saved you, is he by chance a...

181
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,870
I don't know anything.

182
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,810
I don't understand anything.

183
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,280
You can keep asking, but I have no answers.

184
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,900
Oh come on.

185
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,910
Alright then.

186
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,820
Anyway, we'd better get out of here.

187
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,080
Let's go!

188
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,540
Over here!

189
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,700
Go, go, go!

190
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,890
Ow... got it!

191
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,550
It really is Jiro.

192
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,340
Jiro?

193
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,140
The one that disappeared sometime ago.

194
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,730
Don't you remember?

195
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,520
Is that the other prototype that Dr. Komyoji developed?

196
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:37,480
No. This is the one which he installed the "Conscience Circuit" in.

197
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,680
But you are correct in saying that there is another prototype.

198
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,330
More importantly, I want the son of Dr. Komyoji captured as soon as possible.

199
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,220
I just want the Komyoji File.

200
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:54,210
Wait a moment, Minister Tsubakitani.

201
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:03,560
Don't you see that the ARK Project does not need the Komyoji File anymore?

202
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,920
What are you talking about, Dr. Gilbert Kanzaki?

203
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,830
Komyoji is dead.

204
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,820
Is it not better to stop his research

205
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,040
and produce something greater than the Komyoji File?

206
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:19,080
I called you from America merely to assist him.

207
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,950
Can you do it alone?

208
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,980
I can.

209
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,770
My creation Mari far exceeds Komyoji's Jiro.

210
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,790
You were always and continue to be, only second to Komyoji's talent.

211
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,850
I just want to see the finished designs of Komyoji's research.

212
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:46,160
Whether you are indeed better than him or not is of no interest to me.

213
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,320
Why do not you trust him with the responsibility?

214
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,480
It's not that I don't trust his skill.

215
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,630
He is an excellent scientist.

216
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,880
He created you after all.

217
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:07,970
However,

218
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,730
He has no vision.

219
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,300
That is all.

220
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:31,030
Big accident last night in Shinagawa

221
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:31,030
Heavy machinery falls from high rise apartment

222
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:26,210
Here in Shinagawa, Tokyo, as you can see right behind me,

223
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:31,330
some heavy machinery fell from a 45 floor apartment building.

224
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,290
Fortunately no one was injured, however

225
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,680
police are still investigating construction workers for negligence

226
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,490
and other possible leads.

227
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,100
Ms. Kitajima.

228
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,800
Yes.

229
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,080
You mentioned heavy machinery, what kind was it?

230
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,810
Hey?

231
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:49,330
We all know that this is far from what we really saw right?

232
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,770
Look, this isn't the truth right?

233
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,900
This totally a cover-up.

234
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:13,110
In this case, wouldn't it be better to talk to the police?

235
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,720
No, even the police can't be trusted.

236
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,250
What would you even say to them?

237
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,960
If you say a bunch of mysterious armed men attacked,

238
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,970
they won't take you seriously!

239
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,920
But in the meantime, just stay put.

240
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,120
Mister, where are you going?

241
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,800
To work. To work.

242
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:34,860
I may not look like it,

243
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,590
but I'm a very hard worker.

244
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,670
Listen up, don't you leave this place.

245
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,520
Lock your doors and put away the keys.

246
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:44,360
You got that?

247
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,200
Morning!

248
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,210
Long time no see.

249
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,200
So you're still alive, you charlatan novelist.

250
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,870
I see you're as sharped tongued as always, old man.

251
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,270
By the way, being a cellphone novelist is just my part-time job.

252
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,150
Please refer to me as an "net journalist."

253
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:29,670
Youngsters these days are all "mobile" this
and "net" that and think it sounds good.

254
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,660
So what do you want?

255
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,680
Can you take look at this for a moment?

256
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,540
It has conspiracy written all over it, I'm sure.

257
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,490
If this turns out to be some kind of joke, I swear...

258
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,920
What conspiracy?

259
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,720
This time it's true!

260
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,890
This thing...

261
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,020
Where did you get this?

262
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,080
Hey, are we really going to be ok?

263
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,480
Mr. Journalist told us not to leave.

264
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,370
You can't trust that man. He's a weirdo.

265
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:16,570
I'll send a message to Professor Maeno.

266
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,910
Alright.

267
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,620
Professor Maeno was father's mentor right?

268
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,540
Although I don't want to rely on that guy's acquaintances,

269
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:41,450
in our current situation, he's the only person we can trust.

270
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,960
Sis.

271
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,250
No way!

272
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:22,100
Hurry!

273
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,100
Sis!

274
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,250
Masaru, are you alright?

275
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,200
Yup.

276
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,190
Just what are you?

277
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,980
Smartphone.

278
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,690
What?

279
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,410
They found your location when you used your smartphone.

280
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,700
I didn't ask about that.

281
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,160
Who or rather, what are you?

282
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,750
I am Jiro.

283
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,920
Jiro...

284
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,560
You're a machine aren't you?

285
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,350
Correct, I am a machine.

286
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,940
I knew it. Its true.

287
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,520
Being close to a machine like you gives me the creeps.

288
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:02,850
This is all my father's idea right?

289
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,320
If this is all the fault of that guy,

290
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,990
the less I want to go along with you!

291
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,820
Until my body ceases to function, I will protect both of you.

292
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:19,130
That is the mission Dr. Komyoji gave me.

293
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,140
I knew it…

294
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,330
In case you don't trust me,

295
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,420
anytime you need it, you can activate my forced shutdown system.

296
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,990
It's at my back.

297
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,110
Its location is...

298
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,920
Stop it!

299
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:31,850
Sis.

300
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,010
Just what is all this?

301
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,430
Hurry up and tell me.

302
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,130
All this…

303
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:59,430
appears to be linked to something very dangerous.

304
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:12,280
Your Excellency, the Minister of Defense has come to see you.

305
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,260
Come.

306
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:22,230
You called, your Excellency.

307
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,840
This time you've gone too far.

308
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,850
What do you mean?

309
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,590
Do not think that your partisan politics will continue unchecked.

310
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,670
Last night's accident in Shinagawa.

311
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,240
That was your doing am I right?

312
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,670
Impressive, your Excellency.

313
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,930
Only a small number of people are aware of this.

314
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:52,000
Why are you so eager to develop robots anyway?

315
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,680
I want you to convince me.

316
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,620
I'm listening.

317
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,220
Of course.

318
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,520
As Your Excellency already told the news,

319
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,220
It is for the safety of personnel and relief in disaster areas.

320
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,070
And also for work in hazardous areas.

321
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,590
Are those the only reasons?

322
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Why do they need weapons then?

323
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:20,700
Do you not want me to know?

324
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,360
Oh forget it.

325
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:30,250
Now that territorial issues with our neighbors are getting serious,

326
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,790
it is safer for me not to know.

327
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:38,250
It is an honor to have your consideration.

328
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,500
However, Tsubakitani

329
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:47,990
right now the people do not want robotic research development.

330
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,990
You have to consider the public opinion.

331
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,190
Rebuilding the country and reviving the economy are our obligations. Am I wrong?

332
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,150
If the government always bends to the will of the people

333
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,530
this country will sink.

334
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:06,120
You're too extreme.

335
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:09,220
Those robots that you create with such passion

336
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,190
are just things after all.

337
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,250
And things are only things.

338
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,940
Human needs must come first.

339
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,820
Considering the public opinion will only confuse national policy!

340
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,820
Who's the one defending this country?

341
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:31,750
Who's the one willing to get involved in dangerous fighting?

342
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,590
He's someone who only knows how to make complaints
and does nothing by himself for the people of this country!

343
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,220
The best thing for all of us to do,

344
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:43,590
is to continue our work and research on androids.

345
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,590
Some things are things that are simply necessary.

346
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,920
Things are things you say?

347
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,790
Hurry up the development.

348
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,790
Starting today you are the head of the ARK Project.

349
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,730
Dr. Gilbert Kanzaki.

350
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,860
Congratulations, Professor Gill.

351
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:08,360
Professor... Gill.

352
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,250
We actually tagged along.

353
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,900
It's alright.

354
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,590
He's kinda interesting.

355
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,680
Masaru!

356
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,130
You're a machine aren't you? Like a robot?

357
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,700
Android.

358
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,230
Really?

359
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,300
Wow.

360
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,860
Cool! How do you do it?

361
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:54,920
Nanocrystals throughout my body display a 3D projection.

362
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,360
That hurt!

363
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,030
Masaru, stop that!

364
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,050
So, what do you think we should do next?

365
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,330
We should walk or use local transport.

366
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,000
Best to avoid main thoroughfares,

367
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,870
especially large stations and terminals.

368
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,660
If we don't waste time, then we can increase the gap between us and our pursuers.

369
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:19,390
And that will make it harder for them to find us.

370
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,200
Wow, you can think of everything!

371
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,250
That's amazing!

372
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,560
In addition, it is advisable that we sleep outdoors for today.

373
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:32,430
Wait a sec, it isn't up to you alone to decide these things!

374
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,370
What's wrong!?

375
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,920
Sounds like fun!

376
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,080
Start it up.

377
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:06,460
Look well, Komyoji.

378
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,900
So what do you think, Dr. Komyoji?

379
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,960
Clearly the attributes of Mari are above Jiro's.

380
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,960
It should be chosen as the prototype for the ARK Project.

381
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,850
Kanzaki, seeking efficiency in an android is a simple matter. However,

382
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:26,320
being able to properly have a heart is the most critical factor.

383
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,300
Heart?

384
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:31,020
Androids represent the future of humanity,

385
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:36,150
and they have the potential to be a force for good or a force for evil.

386
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,290
For this to be not forgotten,

387
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:43,300
I've represented blue as good and red as evil when I designed Jiro.

388
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:47,220
I've also entrusted the future through the Conscience Circuit of Jiro.

389
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:50,370
Androids are the future.

390
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:57,420
So I'm inferior to him huh?

391
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,530
Bullshit.

392
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,920
Soon I will rule the world that so adores him.

393
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,190
Jiro, this way! This way!

394
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,230
Hurry! Hurry!

395
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,800
Come over here!

396
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:55,730
Begin.

397
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,100
Jiro doesn't eat?

398
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,100
That's because he's a machine.

399
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,190
So what are your likes and dislikes?

400
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,820
Likes and dislikes? I have no such things.

401
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:28,720
That's because he's a machine.

402
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,820
So what about you two?

403
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:33,420
I like video games!

404
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,970
I don't have any.

405
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,630
What about manga?

406
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:45,800
Oh, that's nothing.

407
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,020
It's just to kill time.

408
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,120
What about studying abroad then?

409
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:51,890
I'm not particularly fond of it.

410
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,120
It's not like I'm going there because I like it.

411
00:36:54,130 --> 00:37:00,720
I just thought that it would help me find something I really want to do.

412
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:05,720
Anyway, I think I've told enough about myself.

413
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,870
You must really like games don't you Jiro?

414
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,090
You're a machine after all.

415
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,790
I don't play games.

416
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,520
I do like music.

417
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,950
Really, which artist?

418
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,350
YMO

419
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:22,730
Who?

420
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,760
Dunno.

421
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,430
What about comedies?

422
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,320
The Drifters.

423
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:35,040
"Shimura, look back!"

424
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,990
You know any other jokes?

425
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,730
The Drifters.

426
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,300
Dahhunda!

427
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:49,630
Dahhunda! Dahhunda!...

428
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,160
Masaru.

429
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,700
Stop it already.

430
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,060
For you.

431
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,350
You look better when you smile.

432
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,690
Being angry all the time makes you look dumb.

433
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,160
You really shouldn't have.

434
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,960
I'm glad but,

435
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,710
It would be best not to harm living things.

436
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,830
They're not machines after all.

437
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,250
Is that an injury from the other day?

438
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,420
Are you alright?

439
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:36,530
I'm sorry about earlier.

440
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,820
About that "not machines" stuff.

441
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,840
Aren't you feeling cold?

442
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,360
Huh? No, I'm fine.

443
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,670
The fire is still there anyway.

444
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:05,760
Um... Thank you.

445
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,810
For looking after Masaru.

446
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:18,300
That kid is kinda hard to handle.

447
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:22,090
He's always very withdrawn.

448
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:27,710
I don't really know how to relate to him.

449
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:32,030
But since you arrived,

450
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:39,390
it's the first time I've ever seen him smile again.

451
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,090
He's changed a lot.

452
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:44,390
Became more cheerful.

453
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,060
How come?

454
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,700
How come? I really don't know.

455
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:04,930
Perhaps because you are a pers...

456
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:12,100
Or rather, an android that my father created.

457
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,400
Even indirectly,

458
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,110
perhaps he feels protected by his father.

459
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:24,650
Take for example "The Drifters" from yesterday.

460
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:29,530
That was what my father liked, right?

461
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:36,720
It's because of all the data uploaded to me by Dr. Komyoji.

462
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:38,630
Is that so?

463
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,350
For us, he was someone...

464
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,980
who only lived to work.

465
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,620
We have no memories of being cherished,

466
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:01,820
and we didn't even know if he loved us.

467
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:04,720
And now because of him,

468
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:09,720
we're involved in these strange things.

469
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:14,090
If my little brother's image of our father,

470
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,350
changes little by little,

471
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:24,730
then that might be more or less for the better.

472
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,000
And even for me,

473
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,930
perhaps…

474
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,190
It's nothing important.

475
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:47,760
Anyway, thank you for protecting us.

476
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,270
Until my body ceases to function,

477
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,250
I will protect both of you.

478
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,530
Huh?

479
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:58,560
Until my body ceases to function,

480
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,900
I will protect Mitsuko.

481
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,730
Is that true?

482
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,100
Hurry!

483
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:20,660
A Christmas present.

484
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:22,220
Cool huh?

485
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:35,190
As machine, I want to be perfect.

486
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,050
To be able to protect both of you.

487
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:42,160
It is the mission given to me.

488
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,230
Mission?

489
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,500
That's right.

490
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:08,240
You are a machine that that guy built, is it not?

491
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:51,700
Listen, Jiro.

492
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,050
It is the duty of an android to protect humans.

493
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,650
Do not forget that.

494
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,930
I'm counting on you.

495
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,230
Jiro has been located.

496
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:33,420
It is likely that he is with Masaru Komyoji.

497
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:37,590
Good. Capture Komyoji's son as soon as possible.

498
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,850
What about Jiro?

499
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,860
As long as I get the boy, I couldn't care less.

500
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:43,660
Do what you see fit.

501
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:01,820
Masaru?

502
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,060
Masaru!

503
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:49,790
Sis!

504
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:55,570
Masaru, are you alright?

505
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,880
Long time no see, Jiro.

506
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,920
Hesitating to attack the enemy.

507
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:35,450
You really are an imperfect android.

508
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,330
You're wrong.

509
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,620
It is best not to harm living things.

510
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:43,720
They're not machines after all.

511
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:47,900
A system capable of giving an android something similar to human emotion.

512
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:51,530
This is what the experimental Conscience Circuit embedded inside you is.

513
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,730
It's drawback is that you develop this meaningless obsession.

514
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:57,700
Obsession?

515
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:04,090
It has come to my conclusion that I should be the only android that must exist.

516
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,260
Is that so?

517
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,400
Switch On.

518
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,280
Incredible! He's definitely a machine.

519
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,800
Our objective,

520
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:41,750
is the data hidden in body of Masaru Komyoji.

521
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,200
If we can have that,

522
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,660
we guarantee you his life.

523
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,890
Be obedient and come with us.

524
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:06,640
Stop.

525
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,060
Stop it already!

526
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,990
After all you were just programmed to do all this, right?

527
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,790
Suffering for such a thing...

528
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,330
An android of your level,

529
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:19,590
deserves to be destroyed along with those foolish human emotions.

530
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,930
I... will fight!

531
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:53,210
Is that why you are imperfect?

532
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,290
Then die and become perfect.

533
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,260
Jiro!

534
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:21,260
Stop!

535
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:36,100
It's us you want, isn't it?

536
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,870
Just don't kill Jiro.

537
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,530
Sis.

538
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,730
Alright.

539
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:09,520
I do not want to waste strength even thinking about this piece of scrap metal.

540
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:11,160
Let's go.

541
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:31,360
Jiro, thank you.

542
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:36,730
Your mission is over now.

543
00:58:05,790 --> 00:58:12,510
You're that android that Dr. Komyoji created, right?

544
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,280
And you are?

545
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:16,170
Kyujiro Maeno.

546
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,220
I received a message from Mitsuko and I was waiting for you all.

547
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:27,040
But when you guys didn't show up, I went searching.

548
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,160
Wait a moment.

549
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:35,550
I've spoken to that journalist that has long followed Dr. Komyoji.

550
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,920
Although he's a very annoying man,

551
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:41,350
I am afraid that he is in dire need of you.

552
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:44,520
Who knows, perhaps he might be of some help.

553
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:48,860
You know Dr. Komyoji?

554
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:56,930
Your Conscience Circuit is the brainchild of Dr. Komyoji and me.

555
00:58:56,930 --> 00:58:59,060
Huh?

556
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:02,550
I'm a psychologist.

557
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:05,390
I'm bad in mechanical engineering.

558
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:10,290
My theory is that action is the source of all emotions.

559
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:16,050
He then made a perfect fusion this idea and mechanical engineering.

560
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:23,530
You are the culmination of me and Dr. Komyoji's research.

561
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,660
That's wrong.

562
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:30,520
I am an imperfect machine.

563
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:34,890
So let me ask you this, android:

564
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,390
What is perfection?

565
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:40,850
Maybe being perfect is imperfection.

566
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:45,960
and maybe being imperfect is perfection.

567
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:50,130
I do not understand.

568
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:54,420
Considering the damage to your head,

569
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:59,430
this may seem like too big of a burden to take in.

570
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,380
But even so...

571
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:11,140
There will come a time where in order to protect something,
you have to give up something else.

572
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:15,290
It is a very human thing.

573
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:20,440
I still... do not... understand.

574
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:59,220
We've found the Komyoji File!

575
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:03,530
And with this...

576
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:05,490
Professor Gill,

577
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:12,290
I trust you can complete the ARK Project using the Komyoji File.

578
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,080
No...

579
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,040
our true goal...

580
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:21,840
Defence Advanced Research By Komyoji Project

581
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:26,940
The curtain rises for the DARK Project.

582
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:33,150
My..

583
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:39,740
My research will not go to waste.

584
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:47,270
I'll do anything I can to get recognized.

585
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,920
Even destruction.

586
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:14,770
So, you're finally awake?

587
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:17,760
Or so I'd like say, but then you're a machine.

588
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,740
Perhaps "started up" is more appropriate, huh?

589
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,250
Good, good.

590
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,140
Where am I?

591
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:25,970
It is as you see.

592
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:29,760
The garbage dump of my life.

593
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:36,180
However, you should sleep for a while more.

594
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:54,960
How about that?

595
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:56,590
Impressive.

596
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,300
He really moved.

597
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,130
So what do you know?

598
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:01,820
Charlatan novelist?

599
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:04,390
I told you I'm a net journalist.

600
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,370
Anyway,

601
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,510
I think I know who built him, old man.

602
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,620
I believe that he's

603
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:13,660
an android made by Dr. Nobuhiko Komyoji

604
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:16,780
as part of the ARK Project.

605
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:19,490
ARK Project you say?

606
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:23,780
That robot production project that's made to deal with nuclear power accidents?

607
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,040
Well on the surface it is.

608
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,490
In actuality, unbeknownst to many,

609
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:35,280
the artificial human development project's products where to become fearsome weapons.

610
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:40,840
But during the project's development, Dr. Komyoji learned about the truth.

611
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:43,330
And so he left the ARK Project,

612
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:47,420
perceiving it to be a danger to his son and daughter.

613
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:49,510
And to protect the original data of the research project,

614
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:55,130
he hid it somewhere inside his son's body.

615
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:05,890
And then he ordered you to follow those two around for protection.

616
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:07,510
Am I right?

617
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,200
But the ARK Project;

618
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:17,990
Once you're in, you're not getting out.

619
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,370
Lastly, the guy pulling all the strings is

620
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:23,290
the nation's guardian.

621
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,890
Defense Minister Tsubakitani.

622
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,110
Bingo!

623
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:42,390
Right in the bull's eye.

624
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,950
Well done,

625
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:45,860
Charlatan report writer.

626
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:48,570
It's net journalist.

627
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:50,300
I have a request.

628
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:53,430
Could you keep him here for a while?

629
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,680
Those bastards are gotta be looking for him? So please?

630
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:57,850
Ok! I understand.

631
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:02,280
Those government personnel would never look in a dirty dump like this.

632
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:05,670
Moreover, with you and me around, who'd ever like to come here?

633
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:06,660
So true!

634
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:10,240
Where's Masaru and Mitsuko?

635
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,230
They're safe.

636
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,730
They were released.

637
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,870
And me?

638
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,070
What should I do?

639
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:27,110
We can say that your mission is over right?

640
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,850
Mission over.

641
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:31,900
I see.

642
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:54,640
Gradually these cloud networks formed the internet.

643
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:58,090
It is something created by professionals

644
01:05:58,090 --> 01:06:02,280
to be much larger than other clouds and as an amalgamation of all forms of knowledge

645
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:03,850
Hey, isn't that great Mitsu?

646
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,530
You're really going to America!

647
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:08,420
But that means that she won't be back until four years.

648
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:09,210
Four years?

649
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:09,920
Terrible huh?

650
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,060
We'll miss you.

651
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,200
Really?

652
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:12,880
We'll definitely visit you,

653
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,680
then we'll hang out with your American friends!

654
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,160
That's so naughty!

655
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:28,750
Well, one way or another,

656
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:31,290
the two of you are fine so that's a relief.

657
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,720
Thank you for taking care of us.

658
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:36,090
Don't mention it.

659
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,770
Hey Mitchy.

660
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,420
Jiro is an android, but...

661
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:46,400
Yes?

662
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:49,310
How is he?

663
01:06:52,630 --> 01:06:54,890
He's doing fine.

664
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,540
Want to see him?

665
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:09,850
No.

666
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:16,120
I think it's better not to.

667
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:21,620
Jiro has finished his mission as an android,

668
01:07:21,630 --> 01:07:26,270
and we went back to a normal life.

669
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,900
I see.

670
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:35,050
That's true.

671
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:47,560
[Undergraduate and Graduate Studies in the US]

672
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:57,360
Hey, Mitsu?

673
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:00,010
You're leaving tomorrow and yet you're all gloomy.

674
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:02,850
Is that what they call "travel anxiety"?

675
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:03,490
Well?

676
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:04,480
You see! You see!

677
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,380
No, it's just that I've done a lot a stuff and I'm kinda tired.

678
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:08,350
Is that all?

679
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:09,120
I know!

680
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,040
You've met a nice guy and now having second thoughts?

681
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:12,020
Yes, that's it!

682
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:13,320
Absolutely!

683
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,350
Who? Where'd you find him? Where? Where?...

684
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:17,390
It's not that.

685
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:20,880
All I'm thinking about is going to the United States.

686
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,430
That's the only thing in my head right now.

687
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,320
I've chosen to forget all other things.

688
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:28,890
Well whatever you say then.

689
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:47,100
So there you are, Jiro.

690
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,360
And you are?

691
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:50,910
Hakaider.

692
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:55,330
The ultimate goal of DARK Project.

693
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:56,530
Hakaider?

694
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,950
Your mission is over.

695
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:02,200
He who is born from DARK,

696
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,900
Must return to DARK.

697
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:06,920
I refuse.

698
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:10,910
As machines, we have no other path.

699
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:12,350
Do you understand?

700
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:18,350
Either join forces me or just shutdown yourself right here.

701
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,140
What do you choose?

702
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:23,290
I choose another option.

703
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,970
I will defeat you right here.

704
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:33,110
In that case I'll have to eliminate you.

705
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:39,510
In order to prove the legitimacy of my existence.

706
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:56,380
It's no use.

707
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:58,000
I told you.

708
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:01,940
You are an imperfect machine.

709
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:07,250
You are an imperfect machine.

710
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:24,710
You truly are an imperfect machine.

711
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,010
You're...

712
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:31,750
Come at me Jiro!

713
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:35,210
I'll show you how superior I am.

714
01:12:35,210 --> 01:12:37,050
I cannot fight you.

715
01:12:37,060 --> 01:12:38,920
You're not a machine.

716
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:41,300
You're human correct?

717
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:42,870
You're wrong.

718
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,380
I am the perfect machine!

719
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:49,760
When I turned into a machine I finally understood

720
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:56,470
how wonderful it is to be reborn into such a form!

721
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:05,730
Hurting a living being will only make Mitsuko sad.

722
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:11,010
It seems like the Conscience Circuit is sapping your will to fight.

723
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,150
I will eliminate you.

724
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:16,790
No one's going to protect you now.

725
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:19,590
I was protected?

726
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:26,090
It seems that has Mari arrived.

727
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,420
Sorry, Jiro.

728
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:30,630
I'll have to deal with you later.

729
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:35,930
Just you wait, I'll crush you for sure.

730
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:07,110
Have I offended the Minister?

731
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:14,110
I told you not to let him leave!

732
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:19,190
I was having a good time in Akihabara.

733
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:27,140
That should be good, right?

734
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,650
And you, Jironimo?

735
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:32,950
What do you intend to do next?

736
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,840
Why did she protect me?

737
01:14:35,850 --> 01:14:36,490
Huh?

738
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,120
No, no.

739
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:38,870
Listen when peo..

740
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:41,850
Protecting humans is my mission.

741
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:43,060
But why,

742
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:46,090
did she protect me?

743
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:47,400
Ah.

744
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:50,860
Well, maybe...

745
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:56,920
it's because of her feelings at that moment.

746
01:14:56,930 --> 01:14:58,120
Feelings?

747
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,420
In other words,

748
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:03,070
love, passion and stuff.

749
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,350
Love and passion?

750
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:11,810
Well you see, humans do many things that even they don't understand.

751
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:15,890
Especially when you like someone.

752
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:21,640
For our beloved, we would do anything without thinking about the pain.

753
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,200
Oh, what am I saying!

754
01:15:23,210 --> 01:15:26,880
Well I am sorta a romantic.

755
01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:33,220
You see, I really wanted to be content as a journalist.

756
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:35,970
but it wasn't enough to put food on the table.

757
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:40,150
So now I also make a living as a writer of teenage romantic pocketbooks.

758
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:41,550
Well said.

759
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,540
You learned all that first-hand,

760
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:44,980
am I right, charlatan novelist?

761
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:46,590
Oh shut up!

762
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,070
In summary,

763
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:50,520
every human being,

764
01:15:50,530 --> 01:15:55,160
cannot live exactly how they want because they are imperfect.

765
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:56,470
Imperfect?

766
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,450
Dr. Gilbert Kanzaki.

767
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:02,860
Or rather,

768
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:04,880
Professor Gill.

769
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:08,050
I'm surprised that you turned yourself into a machine.

770
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:11,420
In addition, by acting on your own,

771
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:15,570
you ruined all the effort of hiding this project up to that point.

772
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:18,910
Minister, didn't you once mention

773
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:21,350
that things are just things?

774
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,300
I fully agree.

775
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,030
However, let me add something more.

776
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:29,300
People also are just things.

777
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:31,120
Professor Gill.

778
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:34,570
Do not get confused as to who your enemies are.

779
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:37,500
You are only just another thing.

780
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:38,700
Whatever.

781
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:44,070
If you cannot understand my will, then I will just have to make you obey me.

782
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,780
So until the end, you

783
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:49,900
never saw Dr. Komyoji's vision.

784
01:16:50,330 --> 01:16:58,540
Then I'll just have to show you the kind of world I envision.

785
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:05,990
A world of destruction and chaos!

786
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:33,140
You take care of yourself while I'm away in boarding school.

787
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:34,120
Jiro…

788
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:40,440
We haven't seen him since that time, right?

789
01:17:40,450 --> 01:17:42,060
Is he dead?

790
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,270
I've heard he's fine.

791
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:55,980
Mr. Hattori said so.

792
01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:56,730
Huh?

793
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:00,870
If you already knew this, why don't we go see him?
At least say goodbye one last time!

794
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:03,890
But even if we meet...

795
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:09,540
And that person...

796
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:15,690
Jiro is just a machine right?

797
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:19,880
I'm sure he must have some new mission

798
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:22,170
protecting others.

799
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,410
Jiro must be sad.

800
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:30,840
Machines don't get sad.

801
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:34,170
I don't agree!

802
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:36,890
Hey, wait. Masaru.

803
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:51,850
The trump card for Japan's economic recovery

804
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:51,850
ARK Project research facility engulfed in massive fire.

805
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:47,990
Today in Tochigi Prefecture

806
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:49,990
The ARK Project's research facility

807
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:52,050
is being engulfed by a massive fire

808
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,420
which is continuing on even up to now.

809
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:56,560
Images taken from a remote camera show

810
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,450
the silhouette of a rampaging humanoid.

811
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:03,260
The armed forces are already in the site
and appear to be taking heavy casualties.

812
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:04,440
Old man.

813
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:09,030
Can you not increase my ability?

814
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:12,060
I can not increase it.

815
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:18,270
But I can tell you what limits you.

816
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:21,340
What do you mean?

817
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,480
This circuit here,

818
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:28,500
that's the one suppressing your strength.

819
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,960
By turning off this system

820
01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:37,140
your power can be used to the fullest.

821
01:19:37,150 --> 01:19:41,220
Turn off the Conscience Circuit?

822
01:19:41,230 --> 01:19:43,410
Yes, but...

823
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:46,730
in all likelihood,

824
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:53,280
it is the one governing your thoughts and emotions.

825
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:57,600
In a sense it is your own self.

826
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:59,930
Do you understand?

827
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:02,860
If you turn off this system,

828
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:05,910
the person you one were will no longer exist.

829
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,970
So then please,

830
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,570
just stop this.

831
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:13,820
I understand.

832
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,030
But even so,

833
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,390
I am not human.

834
01:20:19,430 --> 01:20:21,580
I am a machine!

835
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,270
But boss!

836
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:27,860
Just go watch the news right now!

837
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:29,140
Yes, yes, yes!

838
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:30,640
It's similar to that android!

839
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:33,190
The one I'm hiding right now.

840
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,030
Where's Jiro?

841
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,330
Umm.

842
01:20:41,490 --> 01:20:42,980
Where did he go?

843
01:20:42,990 --> 01:20:44,480
Hey Jironimo!

844
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:45,680
Jironimo!

845
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,230
That old...

846
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,080
Old man!

847
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:52,300
Where's Jironimo?

848
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:55,300
Well I tried to stop him, but he left anyway.

849
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:56,950
I knew it.

850
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:58,330
Why did you let him leave!?

851
01:20:58,330 --> 01:20:59,890
Nobody can stop him.

852
01:20:59,890 --> 01:21:05,060
He made his own decision to settle it machine to machine

853
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:07,990
and had the face of man full of determination.

854
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:09,640
Who am I to stop him?

855
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,270
What are you babbling about?

856
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,410
"Face of a man" you say?
But he's a machine!

857
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:15,270
He's not a machine!

858
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,400
He's just a "Drifter" fan.

859
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:18,160
What?

860
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:28,630
I thought you couldn't fight against a human?

861
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,470
You're wrong.

862
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:33,760
It is a fact that you and I are machines.

863
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:37,590
And it's up to another machine to stop a rampaging machine.

864
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:42,000
Because protecting humanity is a machine's duty.

865
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:44,770
In that case I have to eliminate you.

866
01:22:44,770 --> 01:22:53,640
I shall continue to cause destruction until the world bends before me!

867
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:57,190
Like how I eliminated Dr. Komyoji,

868
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:04,130
I will eliminate you and Dr. Komyoji's entire family!

869
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:07,770
I won't let you.

870
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:03,910
You truly are an imperfect machine.

871
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:06,880
Thank you.

872
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:07,910
Mitchy!

873
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:10,080
Sis!

874
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:11,810
Hey, Mitchy!

875
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,470
Sis, there's trouble!

876
01:25:13,470 --> 01:25:17,270
Jiro went off to settle the score that guy.

877
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,140
What?!

878
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:20,780
And to defeat him,

879
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:23,340
he's willing to die for it!

880
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:25,710
What do you mean he's willing to die!?

881
01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:26,680
Mitchy.

882
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:28,140
The truth is,

883
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:30,810
Jiro is fighting with that rampaging android right now.

884
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:32,690
Something about settling it machine to machine.

885
01:25:32,690 --> 01:25:35,120
But if this goes on, he'll certainly be killed!

886
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,400
No... utterly destroyed!

887
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:41,370
I don't understand why you're so conflicted, sis!

888
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:42,360
Masaru.

889
01:25:42,690 --> 01:25:44,690
It's true that Jiro is a machine.

890
01:25:44,690 --> 01:25:46,460
But he's more to me than that!

891
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:48,020
He may be machine or whatever...

892
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:50,390
But Jiro is Jiro!

893
01:25:51,590 --> 01:25:53,900
I know that.

894
01:25:54,170 --> 01:25:55,250
Mitchy!?

895
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:02,860
Passengers bound for Narita Airport, please board immediately.

896
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:05,240
I'm sorry Masaru.

897
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:10,760
Sis!

898
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:11,880
Mitchy!

899
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:33,220
This bus will soon bound for Narita Airport.

900
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:35,620
Wait!

901
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:38,090
I'll go with you!

902
01:26:38,370 --> 01:26:39,910
I'll stop Jiro.

903
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:42,430
I don't want to let him die!

904
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:43,500
What will you do, Mitchy?

905
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,240
I'll stop them from fighting,

906
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:48,630
and then escape together with Jiro!

907
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:49,540
Mitchy.

908
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:52,570
Haven't I told you enough not to keep calling me that!

909
01:26:52,570 --> 01:26:54,400
Here take it!

910
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:09,520
Go do it sis.

911
01:27:53,410 --> 01:27:54,450
Come.

912
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:30,550
Don't you see Jiro?

913
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,480
I have done nothing wrong.

914
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,540
Machines do not exist for the humanity's benefit.

915
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:37,810
It is for power!

916
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:42,850
The search for power is what an android must strive for.

917
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:44,250
You're wrong.

918
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:47,190
It is to protect humans because they have hearts.

919
01:28:47,190 --> 01:28:51,410
That will be your final mistake.

920
01:28:55,550 --> 01:28:56,480
Mitchy hold on!

921
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,340
What!?

922
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:44,730
That's enough!

923
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:49,220
Please stop!

924
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:56,150
You may be just a machine,

925
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:57,240
however,

926
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:59,830
you have a heart.

927
01:29:59,830 --> 01:30:06,610
So please don't sacrifice yourself for the sake of us humans.

928
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:09,410
anytime you need it, you can activate my forced shutdown system.

929
01:30:09,410 --> 01:30:11,770
It's at my back.

930
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:20,310
It's true that I really want to protect you.

931
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:25,670
However, you aren't the only one I want to protect.

932
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:26,670
I...

933
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:33,310
I want to protect everyone's hearts.

934
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:38,030
Heart?

935
01:30:41,410 --> 01:30:43,120
Your heart.

936
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:46,200
Masaru's heart.

937
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:50,240
Every human being's heart.

938
01:30:55,060 --> 01:30:57,830
Thanks to you I realized,

939
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,640
what path a machine like me must take,

940
01:31:00,650 --> 01:31:06,230
and what it truly means to protect someone.

941
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:08,500
And that is why,

942
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:13,400
I beg of you not to stop me.

943
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:28,630
Jiro?

944
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:32,640
Jiro?

945
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:34,470
What's wrong?

946
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:45,710
Jiro?

947
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:51,180
Protect the human heart?

948
01:31:54,250 --> 01:32:00,320
This is the weakness of the Conscience Circuit.

949
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:07,530
With this strong electromagnetic pulse I'm creating, I can disrupt that circuit.

950
01:32:07,530 --> 01:32:08,670
No...

951
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:15,760
I can make Komyoji's Conscience Circuit go crazy.

952
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:43,970
Jiro!

953
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:46,130
Jiro?

954
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:48,830
Jiro?

955
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:52,730
Hey, Jiro!

956
01:32:52,730 --> 01:32:53,570
Jiro!

957
01:32:53,570 --> 01:32:54,210
Hey!

958
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:03,260
Jiro?

959
01:33:07,710 --> 01:33:09,890
Come on, Jiro.

960
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:20,950
Jiro.

961
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:41,220
I will fight to protect the hearts that must be protected!

962
01:33:41,230 --> 01:33:43,940
It's not just my mission as a machine,

963
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:46,230
It is my will!

964
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,570
Until my body ceases to function,

965
01:33:52,570 --> 01:33:56,240
I will protect both of you.

966
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,620
What?

967
01:34:15,010 --> 01:34:19,780
You took out your Conscience Circuit?

968
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:40,310
Do you understand Jiro?

969
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:44,850
By getting rid your Conscience Circuit to defeat me,

970
01:40:44,850 --> 01:40:47,880
You threw away your heart!

971
01:40:47,890 --> 01:40:51,560
You threw away Dr. Komyoji as well!

972
01:40:51,570 --> 01:40:53,400
You're wrong.

973
01:40:54,260 --> 01:41:01,080
I removed my heart in order to protect other hearts.

974
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:19,590
Jiro.

975
01:42:37,010 --> 01:42:38,010
Sorry.

976
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:48,170
I wasn't able to protect Professor Komyoji's heart.

977
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:55,490
That isn't important.

978
01:42:57,290 --> 01:42:58,580
You've...

979
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:04,500
already helped us so much.

980
01:43:25,350 --> 01:43:26,310
Jiro?

981
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:29,920
Are you ok?

982
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:44,990
It appears that even my body was imperfect.

983
01:43:45,410 --> 01:43:47,460
Every human is.

984
01:43:47,850 --> 01:43:50,550
We're all imperfect.

985
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:55,680
Jiro.

986
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:03,260
This would make for a great novel.

987
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:30,590
Jiro.

988
01:44:33,810 --> 01:44:34,850
Jiro.

989
01:45:01,990 --> 01:45:02,740
Jiro.

990
01:45:05,690 --> 01:45:10,350
Now I know what I want be.

991
01:45:15,940 --> 01:45:20,800
Someday I want to be like my father.

992
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:25,200
And I'll fix you up, Jiro.

993
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:27,210
I promise.

994
01:47:01,530 --> 01:47:06,950
The professor's brain was retrieved right?

995
01:47:07,330 --> 01:47:08,010
Yes.

996
01:47:09,750 --> 01:47:17,650
As I've thought, this means that the work of Komyoji still survives.

997
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:23,830
This is the beginning of a new android project.
