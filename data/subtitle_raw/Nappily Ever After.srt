1
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,333
<i>Like most black mothers,</i>

2
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,711
<i>mine was consumed
by the presentation of her child.</i>

3
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,841
<i>I was a reflection of her as a mother.</i>

4
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,056
<i>It was an ever-present source of anxiety</i>

5
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,226
<i>to prove that I was just as well-groomed
as any white child.</i>

6
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,856
<i>They would play, hair uncombed, no shoes,</i>

7
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,984
<i>traces of everything they'd eaten
smeared on their faces,</i>

8
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,445
<i>completely happy and oblivious</i>

9
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,323
<i>to any possible defects
to their appearance.</i>

10
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,534
<i>I, on the other hand, had to be fixed.</i>

11
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:44,081
<i>wash, conditioner, and hot comb,</i>

12
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,643
<i>until my hair was straight enough
to run her fingers through it</i>

13
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,461
<i>without one snap, crackle, or pop.</i>

14
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,379
Ow!

15
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,381
That's your outside voice, Violet.

16
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:55,592
- But you're burning my head off.
- No one likes a complainer.

17
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,262
- <i>Only then was I perfect.
- </i>Hey, baby girl.

18
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,433
You deserve the world,

19
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,061
and one day, you're gonna find a man
who'll give it to you.

20
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,521
Like my daddy.

21
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:12,359
No, Vi. There's not a man in the world
who can give your mommy what she wants.

22
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:17,155
<i>But for an 11-year-old,
perfection was no fun.</i>

23
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,450
Violet, get away from that pool.

24
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,201
You scared of the water?

25
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,664
I bet I could hold my breath longer.

26
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,126
Vi, I'm warning you.

27
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,254
Violet! Violet Jones!

28
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,089
Violet Jones!

29
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,850
What the hell happened to your hair?

30
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,228
You look like a Chia Pet.

31
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,608
<i>To my mom,
appearance was everything.</i>

32
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,820
<i>- We always had to be perfectly groomed.</i>
- Violet! Violet Jones!

33
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,823
<i>Because no fairy tale ever ended
with the words...</i>

34
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,117
<i>"Nappily Ever After."</i>

35
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,874
What are you doing here?
It's 5:00 a.m.

36
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:55,128
How could I sleep on such a special day?
It's just... Where is it, where is it?

37
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,644
- Shh, Mom! Shh!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

38
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,315
It seems like we've been
preparing for this moment forever.

39
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,192
I told you one day your prince would come.

40
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,402
You just missed
a couple of carriages,Â that's all.

41
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,116
Dad is coming tonight.

42
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,456
- Why?
- It's my birthday party, Mom.

43
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,667
He's supposed to be there.

44
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,127
He lost that privilege
when he lost his mind.

45
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,380
He didn't lose his mind.

46
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,426
He quit selling insurance
to become a male model.

47
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,761
Is that not insane?

48
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,723
And I mean,
what is he gonna model anyway? Depends?

49
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,185
If he had not left,
I would have kicked him out.

50
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,564
Will you please,
please be civil? For me?

51
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,150
- I'll try.
- Thank you.

52
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,613
So, does Clint still think
the party's a surprise?

53
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,283
He's been calling my office,
asking April for help...

54
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,660
...so I've been able to plan everything.

55
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:13,664
All right.

56
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,834
What do you think?

57
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,087
Oh...

58
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,650
Mm...

59
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,156
Morning, baby.

60
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,075
Happy birthday, beautiful.

61
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,368
Mm.

62
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:58,709
Hmm.

63
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,096
I've got a little gift for you.

64
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,890
Oh, not that little.

65
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,726
Oh!

66
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,079
- I wanna get on top.
- Yeah?

67
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,580
I wanna get on top.

68
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,083
<i>I wanna get on top. Yeah.</i>

69
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,608
Oh, one of the big orthopedic guys,
he's gonna take me to lunch.

70
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,819
- He's opening up a new sports clinic.
- Oh?

71
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,489
And I think he might ask me to join him
after my residency.

72
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,408
That's excellent, Clint.

73
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,493
Right? And then, of course,

74
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,536
I am going to be taking
my beautiful birthday girl

75
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,163
out for a very special evening.

76
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,666
Sounds perfect.

77
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:24,379
In two weeks, you are going to be looking
at the hottest doctor in town.

78
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,298
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm, it is time to make moves.

79
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,217
Yes, it is.

80
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,928
Mm.

81
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,690
Mm.

82
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,880
Violet Jones' office.

83
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,884
- Morning, April.
- Good morning, Violet.

84
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,927
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

85
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,322
Doctor Conroy called to ask
what your favorite flowers are.

86
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,986
I told him violets, and gave him
the number to A Blooming Business.

87
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,393
- Good girl. What's the forecast?
- Mainly sunny.

88
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:23,813
Highs in the mid-70s,
seven percent relative humidity,

89
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,899
and a five percent chance
of precipitation.

90
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,902
Perfect. Tell the girls,
lunch on the patio is on.

91
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:29,985
Okay.

92
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,200
We start with our woman.
She's a pretty girl.

93
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,285
She doesn't love what she sees.

94
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,955
We cut to her date,
waiting in the next room.

95
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,461
He has front row tickets to a show,
and according to his Rolex, they're late.

96
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,715
But our woman has found the answer:

97
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,384
Long Live Red by Essential.

98
00:09:55,261 --> 00:10:00,225
She stands in the doorway,
looking beautiful. She is perfect.

99
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,274
Great lips, great night.

100
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,150
Great pitch.

101
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,571
Well done, well done.

102
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,949
So, wait. If I'm not 90 pounds
with injected lips,

103
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,952
- I don't get a hot guy to ask me out?
- Not going on a lot of dates, huh?

104
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,995
Well, I loved it, Violet. I loved it.

105
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,999
But tomorrow, add some more details
about your projected use of ad space.

106
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:25,917
- Okay?
- Got it.

107
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,460
All right. Good job.

108
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,921
Oh, are we calling it? I love it.

109
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,340
No, but seriously, Vi,
they got you in a little box.

110
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,884
You got it dressed up so pretty,
you think it's a condo.

111
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,955
Does that look like a rain cloud?

112
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:42,016
Look, you should be doing
some of them pimp spots, like Budweiser.

113
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,434
You know, Home Depot.

114
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,312
- Viagra.
- You would say that.

115
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,415
When a black couple walks into your office
to buy a house,

116
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,483
who does your boss trot out to greet them?

117
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,360
Oh!

118
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,279
See, I... I don't... I don't trot.

119
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,322
It's a brisk strut.

120
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:59,909
Listen, I am very good at selling
to the female market,

121
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,162
and if it ain't broke...

122
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,250
- Are you sure that's not a rain cloud?
- The weather report said no rain.

123
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,793
I checked twice.

124
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,546
Anyway, after tonight...

125
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,508
my career is gonna take a back seat...

126
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,512
because the doctor is about to be in.

127
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,851
- Gotta get ready.
- I know. I gotta find something to wear.

128
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,813
Oh, look at them! So cute!

129
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,482
- I can't wait.
- I can.

130
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,193
Hey, don't spray me!

131
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,368
Mom? Call me back.
I... I can't get into my normal salon.

132
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,621
I need help.
Call me as soon as you get this.

133
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,944
He is not proposing to you
because of your hair.

134
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,334
Violet, he loves you for who you are.

135
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,127
Does your husband know
about your Jewfro?

136
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,339
Because I have plenty of pictures
of the two of us in college.

137
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,674
Mom, I just called you at home.

138
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,179
- Call me back. Where are you?
- All right, all right, look.

139
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,742
I'm going to call my hairstylist
and see if she can fit you in.

140
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,933
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay?

141
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,184
Uh, offer money.

142
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,312
- All right, how much?
- Fifty. One hundred.

143
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,689
Two hundred dollars
to whoever has the next appointment.

144
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,358
- Okay. Just breathe.
- Yeah.

145
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,443
Okay.

146
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,279
Hey, Lalisa, girl!

147
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,914
What was I thinking?

148
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,875
You talked me into this.
This is your fault.

149
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,167
My fault?

150
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:34,754
You want to blame me
for making you look damn good,

151
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,506
I'll take it. But this...

152
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,591
This is all God's work.

153
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,471
But brothers love long hair.

154
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,937
What brothers want...

155
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,107
is a woman who's real.

156
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,078
You know, it's rude to stare.

157
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,871
Pay me five dollars, and I'll stop.

158
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:10,581
Excuse me?

159
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,334
You just paid Jackie $200
not to get her hair done.

160
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,045
Sorry, no deal.

161
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,674
You know, you can sponsor, like,
six kids from Uganda

162
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,551
with that money you're spending for hair.

163
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,262
I'm sorry, where is your mother?

164
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,807
Zoe, are you bothering my clients again?

165
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:31,394
Make yourself useful.
Go get Crystal some conditioner, okay?

166
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,314
Girl, she does whatever flies
into her head.

167
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,066
My mama would have popped me good
for running my mouth

168
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,110
- and having hair looking that crazy.
- Mm-hmm.

169
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,112
Come on, let's get you washed up.

170
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,373
You okay?

171
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,832
I'm fine.

172
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,681
Uh, excuse me, I need to be rinsed.

173
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,476
You have seven more minutes to condition.

174
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,023
Now, please!

175
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,194
Oh, God, thank you.

176
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,160
Lalisa?

177
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,829
- What?
- Uh-uh!

178
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:34,374
Oh, my goodness.

179
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:35,833
Oh, shit.

180
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,584
What?

181
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,254
Oh, my God!

182
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,551
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

183
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,303
Okay, all right. Vi, calm down.

184
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,264
All right, it's really not that bad,
you know. We could comb it over.

185
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,683
- What happened?
- I... I just washed and conditioned her.

186
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,021
- You used relaxer.
- What?

187
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,856
I used what Zoe handed me.

188
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,400
You!

189
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,026
You did this!

190
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,487
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Mistakes happen.
- This was no mistake!

191
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,864
- Where the hell is her mother?
- Her mother's not around.

192
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,425
She's my daughter,
I take responsibility.

193
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,535
That's your daughter?
With that mop on her head?

194
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,328
I am sorry this happened,

195
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,092
but don't talk
about my daughter like that.

196
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,290
But? No, no, no, no, no.
There is no "but."

197
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,543
You can think whatever you want
about me right now,

198
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,963
but in a few hours,
my man will be proposing to me,

199
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,966
so I suggest you go
to one of those thousand hair supplies

200
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,552
on this block
and buy me the best hair money can buy,

201
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,680
and figure out a way
to attach it to my head!

202
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,855
Surprise!

203
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:52,368
I am surprised
you're still doing her hair.

204
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,454
- Oh!
- She looks gorgeous.

205
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,040
Oh, that's just one
of our little things we do.

206
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,210
You're lucky, Vi.

207
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,337
Your grandmother hated doing
your mom's hair.

208
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,216
She used to just send her outside
with this... afro.

209
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:11,012
The boys on the block
used to call her Willie Mays.

210
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,347
Really?

211
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,431
Mom!

212
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,352
Well, now they'll be calling me
the mother-in-law of a doctor.

213
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,314
Well, happy birthday, Vi.

214
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,359
Thanks, Dad. Wait, you're not leaving.

215
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,028
Clint's going to, um...

216
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,155
uh, make a toast,

217
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,990
and I really want you here.

218
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,992
Well, I have an early call tomorrow.

219
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,369
a big photo shoot.

220
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:36,954
Oh, excellent!

221
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,416
This is all still a little weird for me.

222
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,127
Hey, enjoy your party.

223
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,211
- Thanks, Dad.
- Love you.

224
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,253
I love you.

225
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,424
Good night, Richard.

226
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,140
You okay?

227
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,143
Never better.

228
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,604
Good.

229
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,568
Ladies and gentlemen,

230
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,613
if I could just have your attention
for one minute, please.

231
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:18,621
So, I've been asking myself,
what do you get the perfect woman?

232
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,292
You are as beautiful
waking up in the morning

233
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:26,170
- as you areÂ at night.
- No, I'm not.

234
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,047
It's unnatural how perfect.

235
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:34,554
So, I kept coming back
to that sense of... family.

236
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,307
Oh!

237
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:40,810
Oh, Clint.

238
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,938
Oh, this is the happiest moment
of my life.

239
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,190
Oh!

240
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,733
Oh, my.

241
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,153
Oh!

242
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,322
What's this?

243
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,559
This might help.

244
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,244
- Oh!
- Oh!

245
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,668
Mm-hmm.

246
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,878
Meet Lola.

247
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,339
That's cool.

248
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,968
- Our first pet together.
- Oh.

249
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,181
And one that won't make a mess.

250
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,812
A dog?

251
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,148
He got me a dog.

252
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,733
What's wrong with me?

253
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,067
Oh, Vi.

254
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,862
There's nothing wrong with you.

255
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,282
Clint didn't propose tonight, but he will.

256
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,908
Soon.

257
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,287
Now freshen up, pick up that mutt,

258
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,789
and go back out there
with a smile on your face.

259
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,064
You don't like the dog.

260
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,650
What's not to like?

261
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,863
Did something happen at the party?

262
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,033
No, absolutely nothing happened
at the party.

263
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,662
What's that supposed to mean?

264
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,707
I was expecting a ring, Clint.

265
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,291
A ring?

266
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,795
Like an engagement ring?

267
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:31,878
Yes!

268
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:33,440
Why would you... would you think that?

269
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,592
Why? We've been together two years.

270
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,096
You said tonight I'm perfect.

271
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,849
Yeah, I did.

272
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,062
But that doesn't mean
we're ready to get married.

273
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,438
Yes, it does.

274
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,441
I... I want a husband,

275
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,235
not a boyfriend.

276
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,698
And a child, not a Chihuahua.

277
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,534
I'm not even a dog person.

278
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,910
Exactly.

279
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,413
What is that supposed to mean?

280
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:10,042
You know, I had to ask your assistant
what your favorite flowers were.

281
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,753
Your favorite wine. Your favorite music.

282
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:13,837
So?

283
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,549
So? You're talking about getting married.

284
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,260
I don't even know you.

285
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,178
Of course you do!

286
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,639
No. I know you're beautiful.

287
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,518
I know you're smart,
and you dress right, you act right,

288
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,896
you always say the perfect thing,
but you never let your hair down.

289
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,275
We go to a party, you don't dance.
You don't drink.

290
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,610
We've never just got buck wild
in the shower,

291
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,446
or just acted silly together.

292
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:43,701
You never take a chance, Vi,
because you've always gotta be perfect.

293
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,786
But 24/7 perfection is...

294
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,039
It's like being on a two-year first date.

295
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,129
Oh, my God.

296
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,968
You're never gonna marry me,
are you, Clint?

297
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,972
Babe, come on, that's...
That's not what I said.

298
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,646
I think you need to leave.

299
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,107
Are you being serious right now?

300
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,068
I think we need to stop wasting
each other's time.

301
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:20,946
So, because I won't marry you
at this moment,

302
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,241
you're saying it's over?

303
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,162
The first date has to end sometime.

304
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,038
Come on, go.

305
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,624
Go to the bathroom!

306
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,585
Don't you have to go?

307
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:06,802
Lola, I have to go to work.

308
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:14,852
Lola, go... to the bathroom!

309
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,940
Yay!

310
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,861
Hey.

311
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,909
Ugh.

312
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,627
Good morning, Violet.

313
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,048
Okay, so, um...

314
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,510
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

315
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,512
Is, uh, everything ready
in the conference room?

316
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,015
Uh, Violet?

317
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,519
Oh, God.

318
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:02,107
And we... Then we go to our woman,
and she has on lipstick.

319
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,362
Uh, she has to put the lipstick on first,
of course.

320
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,781
She puts on Long Live Red.

321
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,574
Um...

322
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,536
Yeah, Long Live Red,
and, um, then she comes out...

323
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,371
Shit!

324
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,085
She comes out.

325
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:27,174
You know already.

326
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,134
She's beautiful, and, um...

327
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:32,096
...he's happy about it.

328
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:37,267
So... so what we're saying is
all women are pretty,

329
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:42,439
but you won't be perfect
until you wear Long Live Red?

330
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,940
Yes.

331
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,067
No.

332
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:47,736
Did I say perfect?

333
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:52,241
'Cause that wouldn't be nice,
or even fair, to call her perfect.

334
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:55,828
I mean, she's beautiful,
but she's much more than that.

335
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,288
Much, much more than that.

336
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,834
Fine. Then she's in Phi Beta Kappa
as well.

337
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,520
- Right?
- No, no, no, no, Bill.

338
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,963
I don't...
I don't think you're really seeing her.

339
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:10,134
She is, um, way, way, way, way more
than that.

340
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,679
Still, we all want to fuck her,
and that's really the point of the ad.

341
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:15,388
Right, Violet?

342
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:18,725
Yeah, mm-hmm.

343
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,982
Tyson loves your campaign.

344
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:29,069
He... just doesn't want you
on the account.

345
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:31,739
Alicia's gonna take over.

346
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:34,366
I want you to take a few days, okay?
Get your head straight.

347
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,506
I don't think that'll go very well
with the turquoise dress.

348
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,802
Oh, it's you. I guess you're right.

349
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,223
- Ow!
- Trust me, handcuffs would hurt worse.

350
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:42,059
Now, take the dress out of your backpack
and put it on the counter.

351
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:46,271
All the clothes have security tags.
You would have been caught at the door.

352
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,317
No, you wait for somebody else
to set off the alarm first,

353
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,401
then you walk through.

354
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,403
Oh, so clearly you've done this before.

355
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:56,532
I heard. Anyway, it was
a birthday present from my mom.

356
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,200
For. For your mom.

357
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,619
And that doesn't make it right. Come on.

358
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,379
Now, say thank you
to the nice security guard.

359
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,291
- Uh, wait a minute.
- Say it!

360
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,418
No!

361
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,587
Ma'am, could you stop, please?

362
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,258
So lucky I don't believe
in putting my hands on you,

363
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,926
or you'd be laid out on this sidewalk.

364
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,053
- I'm sorry!
- Sorry doesn't cut it, Zoe!

365
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,513
How did you even get here?

366
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,722
- The bus.
- The bus?

367
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,185
What gets you more excited, huh?
Being arrested or being kidnapped?

368
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,623
- Answer me when I'm talking to you!
- Look, I know what she did was wrong,

369
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,357
but maybe it was a cry for help.

370
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,418
- What the hell is she crying about?
- I don't know.

371
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,777
All right, then, stay out of it.

372
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:35,529
Excuse me, I was put in it

373
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,865
the moment I was strip-searched
by that security guard.

374
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:40,908
I've earned the right to tell you,
you don't know what's going on with her.

375
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,830
And in what world would I take advice
about my daughter from you?

376
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,623
Let's go. Move it.

377
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,003
Please! We are in public.

378
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,129
Stop it!

379
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:01,805
Quit tickling me!

380
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,560
<i>Wow.</i>

381
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,353
Wow.

382
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,104
Wow?

383
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,648
Or "wow!"?

384
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,984
- Just...
- Wow.

385
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,067
Yeah.

386
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:18,864
I think it's hot.

387
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:24,912
I mean, I don't really know if it's you.

388
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:26,955
You know, maybe you just
want to keep it simple?

389
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,249
- Yeah, just be yourself.
- Yeah.

390
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,542
And what would that be?

391
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:33,045
The Anal-Compulsive Miss Perfect cut,

392
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,839
or the...
The Not Fun, Never Spontaneous Weave?

393
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,716
I mean, I liked the weave.
It was cute.

394
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:40,093
Violet, I think you're being
too hard on yourself.

395
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,262
This is me.

396
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,350
This is called "fuck you" hair.
Says so right on the box.

397
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:51,647
I just wasted two years of my life
on that asshole...

398
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:59,071
...so we are gonna go out,
and I am gonna get myself right.

399
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,991
- It's not really a "fuck you" outfit.
- No.

400
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,660
I mean, if you're really gonna do this,

401
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,255
the carpet's gonna
have to match the drapes.

402
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:08,163
Mm.

403
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,880
I want to do this, I just don't know how.

404
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,882
- Just go with how you feel.
- Yeah.

405
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:21,846
I feel like I should be on a pole,
and Floyd Mayweather's making it rain.

406
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,404
Okay, well, go with...

407
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,181
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my God.Â Oh, my God.

408
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,016
- Oh, my God.
- I think even God's laughing.

409
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,103
- Up. Come on. There you go.
- There you go.

410
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,521
All right.

411
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,065
If you leave now,

412
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,567
I know you're just gonna feel stupid
the rest of the night,

413
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:41,738
but if you stay here, I promise you,
I'll make you laugh a little bit.

414
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,699
Take as much time with her as you need.

415
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,639
- Vi, we gonna hit the dance floor, girl.
- You're leaving me?

416
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:49,204
Yeah, girl, you better have some fun! Oh!

417
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,894
- You're good?
- Yes.

418
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,290
- You're funny!
- You had a lot to drink.

419
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,940
- I did!
- I'm so funny?

420
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:20,527
Oh!

421
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,196
Wow!

422
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,742
Ooh, impressive!

423
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,951
You're impressive.

424
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,911
Ooh!

425
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,706
Ooh!

426
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,415
Mm!

427
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,713
Just slap me if that was too fast.

428
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,800
See, I was right about you.

429
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,470
Your hair told me everything
that I needed to know.

430
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,306
You're not afraid of anything.

431
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,807
No, I'm not.

432
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,601
You love to take a chance.

433
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,478
- Yes, I do.
- Yeah.

434
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:56,813
Oh, shit.

435
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,815
- I'm sorry.Â I'm sorry.
- No.

436
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,107
No, I liked it.

437
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:02,069
- You liked it?
- Yeah.

438
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,737
You are a wild one, aren't you?

439
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,030
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.

440
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,617
- Shock me, baby. Shock me.
- Shock you? Okay.

441
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,700
- Shock me.
- Yeah.

442
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,831
Mm!

443
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,000
No, no. Hold up. Safety cap there.

444
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,978
- Yeah, you gotta open it. Mm-hmm.
- There you go.

445
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,420
Okay. Yeah, okay.

446
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:23,382
Oh, yeah, that's... that's hot.

447
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:26,301
- Oh!
- Ooh!

448
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,055
Ow!

449
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,141
- Ow!
- Oh, no, it's... it's... erotic. It's fine.

450
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,769
- You're bleeding.Â You're bleeding!
- Oh, no, just...

451
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,396
Let me just sit up here for a second.

452
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,481
Ah, no, it's fine. It's fine.

453
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,568
This is terrible.

454
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:47,406
Uh, no, no, it's, uh... No, it's, uh...

455
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:48,824
What was I saying?

456
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,995
I gotta... I gotta go.

457
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:56,706
You don't have to run off!

458
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,042
I'm barely even bleeding now.

459
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:25,068
So, maybe he was just using me
to get through his residency. I mean,

460
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,988
it's obvious he was gonna
have me waiting on him forever.

461
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,241
I had to move on with my life.

462
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,324
That's it?

463
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:36,246
I mean, he didn't cheat on you?
He didn't hit you nor nothin' like that?

464
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:37,329
No.

465
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,666
But he hurt my feelings.

466
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,295
I mean, he... he broke my heart.

467
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,505
He hurt your feelings.

468
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,508
- Now you want to put a gun to his head?
- Yeah.

469
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:51,303
"Marry me or else."

470
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,309
Now, you know, men and women,
they're kind of like, uh, puzzle pieces.

471
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,645
No two pieces alike,
come in all different sizes,

472
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,814
different shapes, in this puzzle, and...

473
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:06,943
But, when a piece does fit, well,
when one piece goes into the other,

474
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:08,570
the search is over.

475
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,032
And you can even take 'em apart,
but they still gonna fit.

476
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,242
Mm-hmm. You can believe that.

477
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,245
A fit is a fit is a fit.

478
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:28,131
Can you take me
to Emory University Hospital?

479
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:29,924
For what?

480
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,969
I have to put the puzzle back together.

481
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,817
Ow, shit!

482
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:05,126
Violet, what... What are you doing here?

483
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,338
Nothing. Forget you ever saw me.

484
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,716
Hey, no, wait. Hey, come on.
What's... What's going on?

485
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,887
What did you do to your hair?

486
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,224
It's called "fuck you" hair. You like it?

487
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:22,310
- Wow.
- Your nurse needs you.

488
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,794
Kandi's a doctor. I don't know
what you're thinking, but she's...

489
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,695
You slept with her, Clint!

490
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:39,077
Glad to see
I meant so much to you.

491
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,246
You're the one who asked me to leave, Vi.

492
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,749
And you did, without even hesitating.

493
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,498
Doctor, my ass.

494
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:55,987
Hmm.

495
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,042
Ooh...

496
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,506
Ow!

497
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,731
Coming!

498
00:40:05,862 --> 00:40:06,863
Oh, hey, baby.

499
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,781
You know, I found something

500
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:09,949
- that I think is...
- Mom.

501
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,409
- Mom.
- What?

502
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,492
What?

503
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,210
Mommy.

504
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,048
Mom?

505
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,382
Mom!

506
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:29,052
- Ah!
- Mom!

507
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,721
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

508
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,101
How is she?

509
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,562
She's fine, same as always.

510
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:44,025
Course, she's convinced you're a lesbian,
by the way, so be prepared.

511
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,235
Thanks for coming.

512
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:50,365
Vi, you really shouldn't be calling me
for things like this anymore.

513
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,409
Come on, Dad, do you even remember
what you were angry at her about?

514
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,536
Yes.

515
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,247
Well, what if I need you?

516
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,584
Look at me.

517
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,635
It just shows off more
of your pretty face.

518
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:14,347
I've worked so hard
to be everything he wanted.

519
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,183
And it still wasn't enough.

520
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,020
I'm so tired.

521
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,899
Of course you're tired, baby girl.

522
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,071
Look, you think...

523
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,449
that this is just something
you did on a whim?

524
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,035
I think you've been building up to it.

525
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:39,580
Now, I understand what you're going
through probably better than anyone.

526
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:40,664
And you know what?

527
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:42,458
You gonna be okay.

528
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,252
We'll get this cleaned up.

529
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,212
You've just gotta soldier on.

530
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,675
And, look, you've got the head for it.

531
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,503
Sorry, but I...
I really need to get in there.

532
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:30,089
Can you just use...

533
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,842
Can you just use the men's room, please?

534
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,677
I'd really prefer not to.

535
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:40,975
Look, there are six women to every man
waiting to use a public restroom,

536
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,120
so there's an excellent chance
that it will be empty.

537
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:44,896
Just leave me the hell alone.

538
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,537
Sorry! Sorry, no, this isn't your fault.

539
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:05,249
No. I apologize. I...

540
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,376
I was incredibly rude.

541
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,420
I'm sorry.

542
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:12,632
That's a pretty scarf.

543
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:14,217
Thanks.

544
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,095
I am just so emotional lately.

545
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,055
Well, if it means anything, I...

546
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:23,726
I thought I was gonna be engaged...
last week.

547
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:26,562
And I'm supposed to be at work today,

548
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:29,107
and all I want to do is curl up
under the covers.

549
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,900
So do it.

550
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,193
I can't.

551
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:36,030
Hey,
you should really come to my group.

552
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:41,410
Oh, no, I'm not one to tell
my personal business to strangers.

553
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,413
Well, I'm a stranger,
and you're talking to me.

554
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,624
No, what can it hurt, right?

555
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:52,213
There you go.

556
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,632
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

557
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:59,220
He said that
he couldn't handle us anymore.

558
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,930
Handle it.

559
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,851
He's in the middle of dumping me,
and at the same time,

560
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:08,229
he's scared about how I'm gonna react.

561
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:12,692
Am I gonna lose it,
find a bridge, jump off?

562
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:17,155
I say, "Baby, please, I've lost my job,

563
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:19,782
I've lost my hair,

564
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:25,288
I've lost my $1,200 implants
in my left breast.

565
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:31,169
If I can get over cancer,
then I can get over your simple ass."

566
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,051
You don't have to do that.

567
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,678
Sneak out.

568
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,223
I'm Erika.

569
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:48,436
You're new,
but you have a right to speak up.

570
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,397
No, I... I really don't.

571
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,734
- Violet, it's okay.
- No, it's... it's... it's not.

572
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,779
I... um...

573
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:10,708
My boyfriend didn't give me a ring,
and so, uh... I shaved my hair off.

574
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:19,175
You guys are incredible, to be dealing
with everything you're dealing with

575
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:24,096
and still to have the courage
to... to not feel sorry for yourselves.

576
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,602
I am so sorry for the misunderstanding.

577
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:37,401
The first thing I asked my doctor when
he told me I was gonna have to have chemo

578
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:40,112
was, "Am I gonna lose my hair?"

579
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:41,948
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

580
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,575
So, let's see.

581
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,591
Shit!

582
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:04,762
You walk around like that,
of course you're gonna get ignored.

583
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,058
You gotta own it, girl.

584
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:10,518
Own it.

585
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,233
All right.

586
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,743
- Wow!
- You go, girl.

587
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:39,922
In my six years here,
I've got every account I've gone after.

588
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,592
And, despite what happened,
that includes Essential.

589
00:46:43,676 --> 00:46:44,802
I deserve a shot.

590
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:48,806
Yeah, Violet, you're my go-to girl
for beauty accounts.

591
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,266
I mean, that's your thing.

592
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,228
And you were g... You <i>are </i>great at it.

593
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,690
Well, let me prove I can be great
at something else.

594
00:46:58,607 --> 00:46:59,817
I want Amber Lite.

595
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:07,908
Well, no offense, dear, but this is...
That's the granddaddy.

596
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:13,039
You know,
when I said to get your head right,

597
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:15,082
this isn't really what I had in mind.

598
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,835
Are you sure that
you don't need more time?

599
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,378
Bill, I am fine.

600
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:24,633
I just don't want anything that
has to do with beauty right now.

601
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:26,593
Please.

602
00:47:33,476 --> 00:47:34,477
Fine.

603
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,438
Okay. I will give you this shot.

604
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:42,735
But if I am not blown away
by what you come up with,

605
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:46,155
then we go back to the old Violet.
All the way back.

606
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,074
- Deal?
- Deal.

607
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,282
All right.

608
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,161
So soft!

609
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,121
Oh, my gosh.

610
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:57,416
Vi, I thought Common made bald sexy,
but he ain't got nothin' on you.

611
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,251
- You like it?
- Yes, you look so good!

612
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:00,419
- You look bomb.
- Really?

613
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,004
- Beautiful.
- Mm-hmm.

614
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,757
So, what's it like?

615
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,885
Waking up in the morning
and not having to worry about your hair.

616
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:08,803
Yes.

617
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,472
I am so used to looking
at myself in the mirror all the time,

618
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,390
and now I never do.

619
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:17,853
It's only when I catch somebody's reaction
that it all comes back.

620
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,690
But we are not here to talk about hair.

621
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:24,318
Y'all are here to help me
come up with a beer commercial.

622
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:25,486
Okay.

623
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,612
Now, look around.

624
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:28,363
What do you see?

625
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,117
Uh... Guys drinking.

626
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,077
Go! Go!

627
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,121
- Yay!
- Yeah.

628
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:37,081
Yeah, guys screaming at the TV.

629
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:40,668
Latent homosexuality.

630
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:44,213
You know, I hate beer commercials,
to be honest.

631
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:46,006
I mean, they're so sexist.

632
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,050
Do something different, Vi.

633
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,927
Yes. Hear, hear.

634
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,010
Right?

635
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,430
Hmm...

636
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,103
Hello, Zoe.

637
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:47,485
Is that my fault too?
'Cause it doesn't look bad. I mean...

638
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,737
you don't have any dents or nothin'.

639
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,071
No.

640
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,949
I brought you a birthday present.

641
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,494
My birthday isn't for two weeks.

642
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:58,871
Okay. Never mind. I'll just return it.

643
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,831
I actually have the receipt.

644
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,415
Wait.

645
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:11,800
Why would you get this for me?

646
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:13,093
'Cause I felt like it.

647
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,181
Try it on.

648
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:25,314
Zoe, you look beautiful.

649
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:28,692
Yeah, right,
except for my body and my hair.

650
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,070
Why would you say that?

651
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,613
You did.

652
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:38,369
Zoe, don't ever let someone's negative
opinion of you become your reality.

653
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,080
You are a beautiful girl.

654
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,581
You just need a few tips.

655
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,667
My dad won't let me perm my hair.

656
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,835
He says the chemicals
go right to your brain.

657
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,504
You don't need to do that.

658
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,298
Now, just walk across the porch.

659
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,097
Okay, stop.

660
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:00,307
See how your right foot is angled out?

661
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:03,102
Try to walk with your feet straighter.

662
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,105
Stand up straighter.

663
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:07,690
Hold your head up.

664
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,984
Look at that, you just grew two inches!

665
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:14,988
Wow.

666
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,951
Could I ask you for something?

667
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,453
Mm-hmm.

668
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,374
Could this be from my mom,
for my birthday?

669
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,501
"From"?

670
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:32,381
Sometimes she forgets,
and my dad just gets all sad for me.

671
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:36,968
Sure.

672
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,766
I always wanted braids
when I was younger.

673
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,310
But my mom never let me.

674
00:51:45,728 --> 00:51:47,646
Maybe I could draw some on your head.

675
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:51,817
Ha.

676
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,362
What's going on?

677
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,365
And, again, I am...

678
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,868
- ...sorry for just stopping by.
- No, no, no.

679
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,287
It's... quite all right. I'm glad you did.

680
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,290
I haven't heard Zoe laugh
like that in a long time.

681
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,542
She's a funny kid.

682
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:09,960
- Yeah.
- Sweet, too.

683
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,044
Thanks.

684
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:14,882
I owe you an apology.

685
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:18,445
I kind of went at you the last time,
and you were just trying to help,

686
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:20,069
I don't want you to think
I'm an asshole.

687
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,557
I wasn't exactly in top form
the first time we met, either.

688
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:25,684
So you do think I'm an asshole.

689
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,313
So stay, for dinner.

690
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:31,774
I'm making my famous pineapple chili.

691
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,151
Maybe that will change your opinion.

692
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:39,573
Thanks, but, um,
I have a lot of work to do.

693
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:42,076
Oh, come on,
you can't work on an empty stomach.

694
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,161
And I'm sure Zoe would love it.

695
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,460
You know, but, honestly, real talk...

696
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,421
Didn't the hum of the clippers...

697
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:57,299
sound like Harriet Tubman calling you
to freedom?

698
00:52:57,383 --> 00:53:00,052
Yeah, but she lost her voice
when I woke up.

699
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,934
So, what are...
What are all these plants for?

700
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,102
They're my dad's.

701
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,144
Really?

702
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:11,605
Yeah. I use 'em
to make shampoos and stuff.

703
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:12,856
Oh?

704
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:16,902
You see, most women, they tell you that
they get their hair relaxed

705
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,612
because it's more manageable.

706
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,907
But anybody's hair is manageable
if you got the right products.

707
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:25,744
Now, my products,
they take away those excuses.

708
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,162
Excuses?

709
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:28,539
Yeah. I mean, look.

710
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,874
What, we make up 12%
of the population, right?

711
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:34,712
But yet,
we buy 70% of all wigs and weaves.

712
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:36,046
What does that say?

713
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,382
Mm... We hate our hair?

714
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:39,758
You hate your hair.

715
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,802
Ever since your mamas
drug you into the shop,

716
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,638
kicking and screaming, to get a perm.

717
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,808
You know, I swear,
I feel like a vet putting down an animal.

718
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,477
You know, you hate to do it,
but it's part of the job.

719
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:54,148
I'm just trying to change the world
one head at a time.

720
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,772
Starting with that one.

721
00:53:56,817 --> 00:53:59,611
You know,
I tell her every day she's beautiful.

722
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:02,823
You know, but I'm battling TV,
commercials, magazines,

723
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:06,034
telling her that long, straight hair
is what makes you beautiful.

724
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:10,080
Well, I make some of those commercials,
and you can't just put the blame on us.

725
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:11,874
I mean, we're just reflecting society.

726
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,709
Hell, anybody can reflect society.

727
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,003
How about reflecting
what society should be?

728
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,589
I have to please my clients,
just like you.

729
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,672
I didn't make the social rules,
I just live by 'em.

730
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:21,716
Till now.

731
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,427
Are you guys arguing again?

732
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:24,553
Again?

733
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:25,637
Again.

734
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:27,222
Yes, actually.

735
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:28,432
Oh...

736
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,313
Do we really have to listen to this?

737
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,940
I mean, I got my own problems.
Why do I need to hear...?

738
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,692
Hey, quiet down, young 'un.

739
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:43,030
Okay? When you're feeling low,
songs like this send you to church.

740
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,656
- Amen.
- Amen.

741
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:49,203
So, what do you got on your playlist?

742
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:51,913
My playlist?

743
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,290
Yeah.

744
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:56,627
BeyoncÃ©.

745
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,128
Uh, "1+1."

746
00:54:58,212 --> 00:55:00,380
- Mm. Facts.
- Uh...

747
00:55:00,464 --> 00:55:02,216
- Fugees.
- Yeah, which one?

748
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,134
- "Killing Me Softly."
- Must.

749
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:08,347
Uh, "Black Mermaid," Esthero.

750
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:11,934
I don't know that one.
Let me hear it.

751
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,185
Let me find it.

752
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,561
No, just sing it.

753
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:15,687
What? No.

754
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:17,356
Yeah, come on, sing it.

755
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:20,901
I don't even know the lyrics.

756
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,362
- Uh, yes, you do.
- Yes, you do.

757
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,156
You wanna talk about sad? That's my voice.

758
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,950
Really sad.

759
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,993
Okay, you don't have to...
You don't have to sing.

760
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,829
Just... just say the words.

761
00:55:32,204 --> 00:55:34,248
You know what? We won't even watch you.

762
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,125
We won't even watch.

763
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,669
Uh, what?

764
00:55:40,963 --> 00:55:43,382
- Hello?
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

765
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,636
I'm a black mermaid,

766
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,807
nothing rarer you will find.

767
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,560
I am here for you to love me.

768
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,062
I've been here for all of time.

769
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,271
Mm.

770
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,965
Damn, that's a sad-ass song.

771
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:27,634
And you really can't sing.

772
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,398
What?

773
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,318
I see you doin' the math.

774
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:45,818
What math?

775
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,905
Okay, let's see.

776
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:53,744
He's got a bunch of plants,
plus he makes his own shampoos.

777
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,330
Plus he's a hairdresser, but...

778
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,541
he's got a daughter.

779
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,503
And I see him flirting
with all the women in the shop.

780
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:05,881
So, what does it add up to?

781
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,549
So, what's the answer?

782
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,595
Let me take you out this weekend.

783
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:12,930
Someplace special.

784
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:37,579
Oh, my God. Violet.
Oh!

785
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:41,333
Have you seen this?

786
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,752
- What?
- Oh, my God...

787
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,173
This.

788
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:52,678
Oh... my... God.

789
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:56,848
I mean, it's not enough that he leaves me,
he's got to embarrass me too?

790
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,267
How?

791
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:01,186
He... looks nice.

792
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,356
He looks like a geriatric porn star.

793
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:08,360
I mean, people are gonna think that I've
been subjected to that all these years?

794
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,070
I mean, what are they gonna say?

795
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,822
That you're a very lucky woman.

796
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,365
Watch your mouth, Violet.

797
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,786
This craziness has just got to stop.

798
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:20,205
Maybe it's just a... a midlife thing.

799
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:23,667
It's been going on for three months.

800
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:29,548
Where are you going?

801
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:30,631
To dinner.

802
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:34,511
Are you and Clint back?

803
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,594
No.

804
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:38,015
Oh. I guess you made sure of that.

805
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:42,644
Look, I have to meet at 6:00,
and it's 5:30, so...

806
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,563
You're meeting this man?

807
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,525
Violet, it is a man, right?

808
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,694
- Mom.
- Well, doesn't he have a car?

809
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:51,903
I'm sure he has a car.

810
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,822
I just want to keep it casual.

811
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:57,367
And anyway, it's more about his daughter
needing a female role model.

812
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:58,452
He has a daughter?

813
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,495
I have to finish getting ready.

814
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:01,579
No.

815
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:08,712
Oh, my God.

816
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:16,219
I am so overdressed.

817
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:18,472
No, no, no, no, don't worry about it.
You look great.

818
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,806
Thanks for coming.

819
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,351
I'll be right back.

820
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,520
What? Where you goin'?

821
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,565
Violet, you... you look great.

822
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,873
I thought it was a plain T-shirt.

823
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,958
There's no such thing
as a plain T-shirt anymore.

824
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,630
Well, don't get any ideas.

825
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,970
Oh, when you take a girl out,
you really take her out.

826
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:02,390
Thought it'd be nice to do something easy,
take the pressure off.

827
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,852
What can I get you guys?

828
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:07,562
Um...

829
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,483
I'll have the garden salad, please.

830
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:16,738
I'll have a Mo' Better Burger with cheese,

831
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:20,492
uh, some French fries,
and a chocolate banana shake.

832
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:21,493
- Okay.
- Thanks.

833
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:24,663
Wait. I'm sorry.
Can I get what he's getting?

834
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,790
Yeah, sure. $27.50.

835
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,583
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.

836
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:30,961
You know, good call.
I don't like to share my food.

837
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,044
Mm-hmm.

838
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:37,008
So, weren't you about to get hitched?

839
01:00:37,968 --> 01:00:41,429
Wow, what a way to keep the pressure off.

840
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,391
You can't get to know a person
unless you ask questions.

841
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,937
He didn't want to marry me.

842
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:50,772
Why? What's wrong with you?

843
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:54,276
Apparently nothing.
He said I was too perfect.

844
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,654
Ah. Clearly, he hasn't seen you lose it
in the beauty parlor.

845
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,867
You know the thing he said
that hurt the most?

846
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:02,950
What's that?

847
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:06,830
That being with me was like
being on a two-year first date.

848
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,879
Maybe you just weren't,
you know, comfortable with the dude.

849
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,008
So, where's Zoe's mom?

850
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,051
Good redirect.

851
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:25,515
Zoe's mom, how can I put this? Um...

852
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:29,519
She thought being a mom
was gonna be like a Huggies commercial.

853
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:33,565
And when it didn't turn out that way,
she broke out.

854
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:35,442
Does Zoe ever see her?

855
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:41,781
She gets birthday cards, a present,
when her mom remembers.

856
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,869
You're doing a great job with her.

857
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,163
Except for the hair terrorist act.

858
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:49,915
And the shoplifting.

859
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,877
We laugh, but that was a real eye-opener.

860
01:01:55,337 --> 01:01:58,757
I like to think that I'm enough,
you know, as a dad...

861
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:04,930
But Zoe, she...
She really misses having a mom.

862
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,682
Well, she has a good heart.

863
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:12,229
She just spends a lot of energy
trying to hide it.

864
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,565
Sounds kind of familiar.

865
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,694
Just saying.

866
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:36,169
This is where I like to come.

867
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:38,588
This is so beautiful.

868
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:39,672
Isn't it?

869
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,090
Look at that.

870
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,846
Wow.

871
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,818
Hey, I got something for you.

872
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:03,822
For the woman who wears it short and sexy.

873
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:07,242
It's my passion flower scalp rub.

874
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:09,786
- Aw.
- Here.

875
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,914
Try it and tell me your honest opinion.

876
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:17,418
Come here.

877
01:03:18,378 --> 01:03:19,378
Come.

878
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,508
Ah.

879
01:03:37,439 --> 01:03:39,232
Oh, that smells so good.

880
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:41,484
It's au naturel.

881
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:44,195
In fact, you could eat the stuff.

882
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:49,367
Show me.

883
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,595
Mm.

884
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,351
Mmm...

885
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:46,716
- Girl, you better hold on.
- I do?

886
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:50,595
- No, no, no.
- What?

887
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,597
- There.
- Oh, look! Look!

888
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,937
I won again!

889
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:01,731
Okay, a little bit.
If you overwater them, they die.

890
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:02,649
Really?

891
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,320
Don't kill our plants.

892
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:19,707
I'm proud of you, girl.
But you should have got some by now.

893
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:22,085
I mean, I can't believe y'all
are still just hanging out.

894
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,795
It's not like that.

895
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:27,132
- We're taking it slow.
- Mm-hmm.

896
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:28,341
I'm actually bringing him

897
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,218
to my mother's Fourth of July party
tomorrow.

898
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:31,468
Ooh!

899
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:32,846
Not at all the same.

900
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:36,028
And your mama needs to stop calling that
a Fourth of July barbecue,

901
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:39,394
because I have not once
seen a wing or a rib.

902
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:42,897
Okay, are we really talking about
a straight male hairdresser?

903
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:45,400
I know. Crazy, right?

904
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:49,571
- But he makes me... He makes me feel good.
- Oh!

905
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:55,034
It'll actually be a welcome distraction
because this will be the first time

906
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:57,787
in 35 years that my dad won't be there.

907
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,331
Mm! I saw the ad.

908
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:03,376
A girl at my job had it
hanging up at her desk.

909
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,627
Both pages.

910
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:07,964
- So, is it really this big?
- Please stop!

911
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:10,216
Yes, like Daddy.

912
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:14,804
- Stop! Please stop!Â Please stop!
- Ooh, yes, Daddy. Give it to me, Daddy.

913
01:06:16,431 --> 01:06:19,034
This is how y'all do it
on the other side of the train track?

914
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:23,480
And you're worried
I ain't gon' pass the mama test.

915
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:25,565
Well, you do keep saying "ain't."

916
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,150
Oh, it's like that now, is it?

917
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:28,776
I'm good.

918
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,529
I'm good. Hit that bell.

919
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:40,705
Ooh, it is about time.

920
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:45,084
The guests are eating the decorative nuts
on my Independence Day collage.

921
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:47,462
Sorry. Mom, this is Will.

922
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:49,339
How do you do, Mrs. Jones?

923
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,634
You didn't tell me
you were bringing a guest.

924
01:06:53,218 --> 01:06:54,594
Will brought these for you.

925
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:56,095
It's from my garden.

926
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:59,057
- Your garden.
- Yes, ma'am.

927
01:07:01,226 --> 01:07:02,352
How unusual.

928
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:08,274
- Hi, Violet!
- Hey.

929
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:10,693
Oh, Gerard!

930
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:13,947
I want you to meet my... my daughter,
Violet.

931
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:16,241
Oh. Hi.

932
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:21,788
I'm sorry. I was just... I was looking
at, you know, your old photos.

933
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,373
Gerard is a lawyer.

934
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:25,722
I'm actually working
in Senate these days,

935
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,877
but law will always be my true love.

936
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:29,712
Hey, how you doin', man? Will Wright.

937
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:32,298
How you doing? Oh!
That's quite a handshake you got there.

938
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:33,633
You must work with your hands.

939
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:38,429
Violet, would... would you go
and fix Gerard a drink, please?

940
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:39,764
What, his hand's broke?

941
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:43,810
- That's very funny.
- Mm-hmm.

942
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:45,645
Are you a comedian?

943
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,440
Well, what is it that you do do?

944
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:51,859
- I own...
- Will owns his own business.

945
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:53,443
My own business.

946
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:55,238
Oh, really?

947
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:57,365
And how did the two of you meet?

948
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:59,200
- We met...
- We met professionally.

949
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:03,371
Well, owning your own business,
that does beat working for the Man.

950
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,123
Ain't that the truth?

951
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:06,666
Isn't it, though?

952
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:09,627
And <i>isn't it </i>wonderful to be successful?

953
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:11,629
Yeah, that's right.

954
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:14,173
So, anytime any of you need a cut,
come on into my shop.

955
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:16,175
I just might take you up on that.

956
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:18,678
Think I could do one of those frohawks?

957
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:22,348
- Mm-mm.
- You own a hair shop?

958
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:23,725
Mom, it's a great salon.

959
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:25,435
No, no, no. Shop is fine.

960
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,730
And, yes, I do, Miss Jones,
just like my mama before me.

961
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,275
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I gotta go pick up my daughter.

962
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:35,653
So this is the date with no car.

963
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:37,822
Wow.

964
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:39,740
Will.

965
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,078
I was serious about the frohawk.

966
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:45,537
Will!

967
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:49,626
Will, please wait a minute!

968
01:08:51,419 --> 01:08:52,420
I embarrass you now?

969
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:53,796
- No!
- So what was that?

970
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,010
You know, you're a cool sister,
you really are, but...

971
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:02,305
I don't know. I thought we had something.

972
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:03,222
So do I!

973
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:05,933
But you seem to be mixed up
about who I am and who you are,

974
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:07,894
and a bunch of other important things.

975
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:11,689
And seeing as how I have a daughter,
I'm trying real hard not to fuck up.

976
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:14,948
I'm not in a position to be taking chances
while you figure it all out.

977
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,031
Just get yourself sorted.

978
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,201
Have a happy Fourth.

979
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,759
Think, Violet, think.

980
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:46,641
Something different.

981
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:54,649
Hey, Violet,
they're moving to the conference room.

982
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:55,732
Okay.

983
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,402
It's really great.

984
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:58,944
Thanks.

985
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:09,366
"Girls' Night Out."

986
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:11,666
We're at Philips Arena.

987
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:17,171
Hawks are playing the Cavs,
and we push into four crazy loud,

988
01:10:17,255 --> 01:10:19,465
annoying guys in Cavs jerseys.

989
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:22,593
They're surrounded by rows of women
in Hawks gear.

990
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:26,764
Cavs are winning,
and our four guys are standing up,

991
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:31,310
cheering and annoying the hell out of
a female fan sitting in front of 'em.

992
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:36,691
Then, an Amber Lite vendor approaches,
and the annoyed girl calls him over,

993
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:39,861
orders four Amber Lites,
and hands 'em to the guys behind her.

994
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:41,696
They're shocked.

995
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:47,368
They sit down, clink their bottles,
and enjoy the rest of the game silently.

996
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:51,164
The girl in front smiles,
turns to her friend,

997
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:53,916
gives her a pound,
and turns back to the game.

998
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,044
A cut to a little later,
our boys are depressed.

999
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:58,463
Their bottles are empty.

1000
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:01,966
They look at each other
and smile mischievously.

1001
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,721
They stand up all at once
and start screaming.

1002
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:12,018
This time, every girl around them
starts waving over the Amber Lite vendor.

1003
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:16,439
It Does You Right."

1004
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,526
Good pitch.

1005
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,987
And, um, these friends,
how do you see them?

1006
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:26,407
Uh... Real women, no models.

1007
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:29,011
I want each and every one of them
to have their own unique vibe.

1008
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:30,035
Okay.

1009
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:32,338
It's not the typical way
to sell the product,

1010
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:34,081
but it is funny, and effective,

1011
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:36,167
and I think it could appeal
to the male audience.

1012
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,377
- Thank you, Violet, thank you.
- Good job.

1013
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:40,797
All right, Rich, you're up.
What do you got?

1014
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:47,887
We're on a cruise ship,
and it's going down.

1015
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,472
All the life rafts are full,

1016
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:51,682
but there's still two guys left
on the boat.

1017
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:52,809
One is a stud.

1018
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:54,644
The other is some corny-looking dude.

1019
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:57,855
But then these two gorgeous women,
long blonde hair,

1020
01:11:57,939 --> 01:12:00,817
big breasts, they float up in a life raft,

1021
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,528
and they call out
that they can hold one more.

1022
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:07,323
And of course, the stud grins,
and he pulls his shirt off,

1023
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:10,201
and he's got the pecs and the six-pack.

1024
01:12:10,284 --> 01:12:13,120
But, to his shock,
they point to the cornball.

1025
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:18,209
The cornball
is holding a six-pack of Amber Lite.

1026
01:12:19,961 --> 01:12:22,630
We cut to later, and he's laying
in the raft with the girls,

1027
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:28,010
all three drinking an Amber Lite,
watching the stud go down with the ship.

1028
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:32,598
Thanks, Rich, nice.

1029
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:34,307
Well.

1030
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:36,769
Okay.

1031
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:38,396
Um...

1032
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:41,566
I'm gonna go with Rich.

1033
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:45,528
- What?
- But what's fresh about that?

1034
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:47,530
We've heard that pitch a thousand times.

1035
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,532
If it ain't broke, right?

1036
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:53,536
I guess it depends
on your perspective.

1037
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I quit.

1038
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:01,251
Violet.

1039
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:03,838
Come on,
you can't be serious.

1040
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:07,049
Violet, one pitch. It's one pitch.

1041
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:09,510
Actually, I've been thinking about it
for a while now.

1042
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,763
I think it's time for me
to step outside the box.

1043
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,937
Violet.

1044
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:28,487
Hi, Lola.

1045
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,074
Hi.

1046
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,952
Hey.

1047
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,872
What are you doing here?

1048
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:06,335
I'm sorry, I... But, wow, that was... Wow.

1049
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:07,419
Shut up.

1050
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:08,713
You didn't see that.

1051
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:12,216
I saw nothing. I... Wait, wait. No, wait.

1052
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:13,926
Yep, there it is.

1053
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:16,387
Even better in slow motion.

1054
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:19,974
Why have I never seen that?

1055
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:21,767
Why are you here?

1056
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,104
And what is that smell?

1057
01:15:25,438 --> 01:15:26,438
Uh...

1058
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:31,235
So, I came round
to get the rest of my stuff,

1059
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:34,196
and Lola is really excited to see me.

1060
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:37,658
That, or very protective.

1061
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:42,455
So, yeah, I need to take a shower,
'cause I have just been here packing,

1062
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,123
and smelling of dog pee.

1063
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:46,625
Be my guest.

1064
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:48,377
Take a shower.

1065
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:49,586
Thank you.

1066
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:56,802
I'm sorry if I ever made you feel
like something was wrong with you.

1067
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:00,805
Maybe...

1068
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:06,854
I just tried to find the fault in you
because I was afraid that

1069
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:08,773
I was never gonna be enough for you.

1070
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:12,526
There's nothing wrong with you, Vi.

1071
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:15,571
And I should have fought for you.

1072
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:26,790
Right.

1073
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:30,544
Gonna take that shower.

1074
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:23,948
Hey.

1075
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,450
Hey.

1076
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,706
Okay, so one of the things that I realized
these past few months

1077
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:34,251
is how much you took care of me.

1078
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:36,127
Sit.

1079
01:18:38,339 --> 01:18:41,675
Now, enjoy your time.

1080
01:18:41,967 --> 01:18:43,052
Oh...

1081
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:44,970
Well, thank you.

1082
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,516
You know what the funny thing is?

1083
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:53,646
I've gained so much time
not having to think about my hair.

1084
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:55,439
I mean, it was like a second job.

1085
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,400
It's been really nice.

1086
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:01,987
Does that mean you're
not gonna grow it back?

1087
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:03,948
I don't know.

1088
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:08,035
I mean, I certainly don't
like being dismissed or ignored, but...

1089
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,913
it's kind of forced me
to give up my vanity...

1090
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:14,583
and focus on other parts of myself.

1091
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:19,213
So, what happens when
I walk through that door?

1092
01:19:23,634 --> 01:19:25,511
I... I don't... I don't know.

1093
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:34,269
Hey.

1094
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,856
We'll figure this out.

1095
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,066
Don't cry.

1096
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:42,903
Oh, no. No, Violet.

1097
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:44,822
This is... This is the onion.

1098
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:48,534
So crazy.

1099
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:01,630
Violet Jones.

1100
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:10,222
Will you marry me?

1101
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:17,979
Will you?

1102
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,196
- <i>Oh, my gosh!
- Amazing!</i>

1103
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,365
<i>Okay, so how long
do we have to lose weight?</i>

1104
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:30,242
- Three months.
<i>- Girl, what?</i>

1105
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:32,166
Wait, hold on, guys, hold on.

1106
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:33,620
Hello?

1107
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:36,623
<i>Finally! I'm so happy!</i>

1108
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:37,707
Hi, Mom.

1109
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,671
- Vi!
- Aw.

1110
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,507
Does your dad help you with that?

1111
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:47,426
How'd you know?

1112
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:00,731
Sir!

1113
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:02,941
Nice work!

1114
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:05,819
Oh. Thank you.

1115
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:07,154
May I top you off?

1116
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:09,490
Yes, please.

1117
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,750
So. Let's talk about this wedding.

1118
01:21:20,501 --> 01:21:21,752
What's it gonna cost me?

1119
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:30,803
You know, um, my engagement party
is tomorrow night.

1120
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:32,971
Oh.

1121
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:35,557
And, for some reason,
I'm feeling a little nervous,

1122
01:21:36,016 --> 01:21:38,727
maybe because I'm meeting Clint's parents.

1123
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:40,979
You think you could come?

1124
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:45,859
You'd have to get dressed up,
do hair, makeup, the whole works.

1125
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:50,656
- I'll take that as a yes.
- Yes, yes, yes! Yes!

1126
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:03,794
Shit!

1127
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:08,882
Let me.

1128
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:13,679
It's going to be fine.

1129
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:21,520
Just need everything
to be perfect tonight, you know?

1130
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:25,732
Well, as long as you don't get
any more surprise dogs, it'll be great.

1131
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:30,696
- We good?
- Mm-hmm.

1132
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:35,367
That's it.

1133
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:41,039
- Vi?
- Mm-hmm?

1134
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:43,643
Just wondering if you could do
something with your hair tonight.

1135
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:46,879
Like what?

1136
01:22:47,296 --> 01:22:49,506
I don't know. Like, make it straight.

1137
01:22:50,674 --> 01:22:51,717
Why?

1138
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:55,053
Well, I think it looks great.
I mean, you know that.

1139
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:57,282
Women do different things
with their hair all the time,

1140
01:22:57,306 --> 01:22:59,349
so it's not, like, a big ask, right?

1141
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:03,312
I'm sorry, I just... I just need everything
to be perfect tonight.

1142
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:06,314
Okay.

1143
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:28,479
- Hello, darling.
- Mom.

1144
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:31,088
Dad.

1145
01:23:31,924 --> 01:23:32,924
This is Violet.

1146
01:23:33,509 --> 01:23:34,927
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1147
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:38,764
Would you like a drink?

1148
01:23:44,895 --> 01:23:45,896
Hello.

1149
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:02,246
Ooh. Hmm.

1150
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:08,252
Hmm...

1151
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:11,380
What? So, who do you belong to?

1152
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:12,923
Who are you?

1153
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:15,926
I'm the one paying for the bread
you have in your hands.

1154
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:18,220
And you can keep this one, you touched it.

1155
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:20,889
I'm Zoe. I'm Violet's friend.

1156
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:23,725
Really? Well, nice to meet you, Zoe.

1157
01:24:23,809 --> 01:24:25,602
What a pretty dress.

1158
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:27,479
And your hair.

1159
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:30,440
It's so unusual.

1160
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:34,486
Does "unusual" mean "good"?
'Cause I know I look dope.

1161
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,947
Yes, you do.

1162
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:40,158
Violet had the idea for the flower,
but my dad did the rest.

1163
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:41,285
He's a hairdresser.

1164
01:24:43,203 --> 01:24:45,622
- Well, aren't you lucky?
- Mm-hmm.

1165
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:49,251
These? So good. Try one.

1166
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:50,585
No, thanks.

1167
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:52,629
Oh, come on, I know you want some!

1168
01:24:52,713 --> 01:24:55,173
Excuse me,
you're using your outside voice.

1169
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:57,551
Excuse me, but we are outside.

1170
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:04,266
So, why don't you just get a soda
to... wash all that down?

1171
01:25:04,558 --> 01:25:07,561
- Mm-hmm.
- And please don't... Oh, my Lord.

1172
01:25:08,145 --> 01:25:09,605
I don't believe you.

1173
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:12,274
You invited the hairdresser's daughter?

1174
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:15,193
I mean, does Clint know
about you and her father?

1175
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:17,029
- There's nothing to know.
- Shh.

1176
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:18,447
Beautiful ladies.

1177
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:19,530
Ready to sit?

1178
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,117
Sure, um, can you give me a minute?

1179
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,200
Yeah, sure.

1180
01:25:23,452 --> 01:25:24,452
Shall we?

1181
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:38,050
Ooh.

1182
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:03,367
...marvelous together.

1183
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:08,205
Have you seen Violet?

1184
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:10,247
No.

1185
01:26:10,916 --> 01:26:11,916
Okay.

1186
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:13,960
I'll be back.

1187
01:26:14,419 --> 01:26:15,545
Excuse me a moment.

1188
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,341
Violet.

1189
01:26:21,051 --> 01:26:22,051
Hey.

1190
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:24,262
You okay?

1191
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:29,351
I can't put these heels back on.
I can't be in them another moment.

1192
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:33,563
But if I don't put them on,
I won't be perfect, so I'm stuck here.

1193
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:38,735
Isn't that sad?

1194
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:42,656
Zoe would just go out there barefoot.

1195
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:46,868
Ten years old, and she already
has the guts to just be who she is.

1196
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,120
But I don't.

1197
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:49,203
Violet.

1198
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:51,206
Stop being dramatic.

1199
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,169
Now, there are people out there
waiting for you.

1200
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:59,923
So you're okay with that,
for me to just go out there any which way?

1201
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:01,675
What is your point?

1202
01:27:03,677 --> 01:27:06,596
When I was ten,
we went to some company picnic

1203
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,724
for Dad at some... park...

1204
01:27:10,016 --> 01:27:12,519
and I jumped into the pool.
Do you remember that?

1205
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:13,602
Oh, Lord, I...

1206
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:19,526
My hair turned into a little fist,
and all the kids were laughing at me.

1207
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:25,657
You yanked me out of the pool,
shoved me into the car, and we left.

1208
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:27,742
And?

1209
01:27:29,453 --> 01:27:33,248
I wonder who I would be
if you had just hugged me

1210
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:35,584
and told me I was still beautiful.

1211
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:44,634
You wouldn't be marrying Clint.

1212
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:50,432
That's right. That's right.

1213
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:54,811
You taught me how to be
the girl the guy wants,

1214
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:56,897
but not the girl I want.

1215
01:27:58,064 --> 01:28:00,817
Uh... What does that mean?

1216
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:16,416
It means...

1217
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:19,795
I want to go for a swim.

1218
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:25,967
- Violet.
- A what?

1219
01:28:26,051 --> 01:28:28,178
A swim? Violet!Â Violet!

1220
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:35,894
Violet.

1221
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:38,647
Violet, don't you dare.

1222
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,624
Ah!

1223
01:28:57,707 --> 01:29:00,669
Come in, everybody, the water is fine!

1224
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:02,963
Mm.

1225
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:06,383
Zoe!

1226
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:11,805
What the hell.
I'm flashing like a stop light.

1227
01:29:12,472 --> 01:29:16,643
You know, Margaret, I don't believe
I've been in a pool in 50 years!

1228
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:23,441
- Hey!
- Richard, what the hell are you doing? No.

1229
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:28,572
Get off of me. No. Oh, my God. No!

1230
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:39,708
What is the matter with you?
What the hell are you thinking?

1231
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:45,005
I think you have never
looked so beautiful.

1232
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:50,760
After everything you put me through?

1233
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:54,389
No.

1234
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:50,987
In the past couple years,
there's been a huge cultural shift

1235
01:30:51,071 --> 01:30:52,697
towards what's natural and real.

1236
01:30:52,781 --> 01:30:55,241
We've seen it in the growth
of natural foods,

1237
01:30:55,742 --> 01:30:59,955
the demand for eco-friendly cars,
to just about any product you can imagine.

1238
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:05,794
Will wants women to change the way
we are thinking about our hair.

1239
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:09,547
He wants us to know that there
is beauty in our natural hair,

1240
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:11,967
regardless of what type of hair we have.

1241
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:16,721
And his product line, YOU,
helps us bring out that natural beauty.

1242
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:20,266
But why would I push a product

1243
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:23,353
that totally undercuts
what I'm already selling?

1244
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:26,564
Listen, women can wear weaves
if they want to.

1245
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,776
They can straighten their hair
if they want to.

1246
01:31:29,859 --> 01:31:30,944
It's a choice.

1247
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:32,737
There's nothing wrong with that.

1248
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:37,200
But we also need them to know that
there is beauty in their natural hair.

1249
01:31:37,742 --> 01:31:41,371
Large grocery store chains
didn't ignore the health food craze,

1250
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:44,082
they integrated it
and kept their customers.

1251
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:46,876
The shift has already begun
with hair and beauty,

1252
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:50,588
and women of color are one
of the biggest markets there is for hair.

1253
01:31:51,381 --> 01:31:55,593
Let us be the first to offer them
something that protects,

1254
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:57,303
rather than destroys, their hair.

1255
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:02,100
You were great in there.

1256
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:06,396
- Thank you. Your passion is an easy sell.
- Not gonna lie, though.

1257
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:10,775
I didn't know what to expect, you know,
with all your personal shit.

1258
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:13,820
Wow.

1259
01:32:13,903 --> 01:32:15,196
I guess that's fair.

1260
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:18,992
But I keep my personal out of my business.

1261
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:21,703
I try to,
but it doesn't always work like that.

1262
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:28,585
I'm still salty at you,
so I kind of feel like I'm using you.

1263
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:31,629
I'm using you, too.

1264
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,800
But you can't be salty at me forever.

1265
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:39,262
Change the world?

1266
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:41,931
One head at a time.
