1
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:16,708
Chant the name Hari.

2
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,876
Go slow, brother.

3
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,721
Chant the name Hari.

4
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,888
My... My...

5
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,886
Hold yourself together, sister. Be calm.

6
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,123
I have no one else left.

7
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:43,736
Don't feel that way, sister.
We are all with you.

8
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,907
I have lost everything.
How will I live now?

9
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:51,917
We are all with you, sister.
- How will I live?

10
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,709
Get down.

11
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,216
Go on, right.

12
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,785
Sit down there.

13
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:32,196
Is this your first interview?
- No.

14
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:40,032
Are you aware of the type
of questions they ask?

15
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,698
It's not very predictable.

16
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:48,206
Will they ask in English?
- They may, probably.

17
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,115
Then the answer should also be
in English... - Yes, English.

18
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,217
Yes, naturally.

19
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,193
Do you do mending?
- Why?

20
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,695
I have trousers that need
mending. - No we don't do...

21
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,028
...mending. - Why? - We
don't sew used clothes.

22
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:43,091
I'll leave them here and go.
- No you can try some small shop.

23
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:15,659
Here you are.
- How much? - Ten rupees.

24
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,009
Your name, please.
- Siddartha Choudhury.

25
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,285
Could you show us your papers,
please? - Yes, sir.

26
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:18,157
Would you like to? - How old are
you? - I'm just over 25, sir.

27
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:24,329
You are a B. Sc? - Yes, sir. -
When did you graduate? - 1966.

28
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,332
Have you been idle ever since?

29
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:30,000
No, sir. I was at the medical
college for 2 years.

30
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:36,338
What were you doing there?
Studying, sir. - Only for two years?

31
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:37,841
Yes, sir.

32
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,011
What made you give up medicine?
Did you suddenly...

33
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:46,354
...lose interest in medicine?
- No, sir. I lost my father.

34
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,851
I see.
- What's your aim in life?

35
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,702
Right now it's to find a job, sir.

36
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,234
But the job you've applied for
has nothing to do with medicine.

37
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,834
No, sir. But I also did botany
for my science degree.

38
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:09,811
Do you like flowers?
- Not unconditionally.

39
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,717
Some I like, some I don't.

40
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,983
Does the term mitochondria
suggest anything to you?

41
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,817
It's a botanical term, sir.
Mitochondria are small threadlike...

42
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,986
...bodies in cytoplasm.

43
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,997
Who was the prime minister of
England at the time of independence?

44
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:34,000
Whose independence, sir?
- Our independence.

45
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,675
Atkins. - What would you regard
as the most outstanding and significant...

46
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:41,008
...event of the last decade?

47
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:56,694
The war in Vietnam, sir. - More
significant than the landing...

48
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,196
...on the moon?
- I think so, sir.

49
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,701
Could you tell us why you think so?

50
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,705
Because the moon landing...

51
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:14,041
You see, we weren't entirely unprepared
for the moon landing.

52
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,708
We knew that it had to come
some time. We knew about the...

53
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,048
...space flights, the great advances
in space technology.

54
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,120
So we knew it had to happen.

55
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:27,052
I'm not saying it wasn't
a remarkable achievement...

56
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,321
...but it wasn't unpredictable.

57
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,056
The fact that they did
land on the moon.

58
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,792
Do you think that the war in
Vietnam was unpredictable?

59
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:37,734
Not the war itself. But what
it has revealed about the...

60
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:42,900
...Vietnamese people. About
their extraordinary power...

61
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,239
...of resistance. Ordinary
people, peasants and...

62
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,404
...no one knew that they
had it in them.

63
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,074
This isn't a matter of
technology, it's...

64
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,245
...just plain human courage,
and takes your breath away.

65
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:01,082
Are you a communist?

66
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,093
I don't think one has to
be one in order to admire...

67
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,755
...Vietnam, sir.

68
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,199
That doesn't answer my
question. However...

69
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,705
...you may go now.

70
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,208
Listen.

71
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,219
This is broken.

72
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,884
Hey!
- I've been watching you for some time.

73
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,721
Why do you look so depressed?

74
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,735
No, I've been walking in the
sun and I've got a headache.

75
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,061
Don't you have a job yet?

76
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,239
Are you still applying?
- Yes.

77
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,747
In the end, the time will come
when you'll start believing...

78
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:07,759
...that you don't have a goal
within yourself. And that's not true.

79
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:17,698
I know you. While you're still
unemployed why don't you...

80
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,036
...come to our place sometime?

81
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:26,208
You were active in the union
in your college days.

82
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,714
If you are with us then you
will be able to do something.

83
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,216
The party has a lot of odd
jobs to be attended to.

84
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:35,048
If you remain like this and
roam in the sun then both...

85
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,887
...your mind and your health
will be undermined.

86
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:46,058
What? Will you come? Or is it that
you've no faith in politics?

87
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:51,729
No, brother Naresh. I need a job.
Otherwise the problem...

88
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:56,070
...is that...
- Your sister is employed, isn't it?

89
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:03,242
Is it hurting your pride? - No,
papa didn't leave much for us.

90
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:08,685
That's true. It is not possible
for a honest man to do...

91
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:11,188
...business and leave something.

92
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,190
I know.

93
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,091
Why don't you join some factory?

94
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:20,698
Do some work as a labourer.
What's wrong in that?

95
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:24,031
These days... - No more advice
please. No more advice please.

96
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,697
So many people have given me
so much advice that my mind...

97
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,707
...is stuffed with advice
and is choking.

98
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,207
You're a nice person and
I admire you, but still...

99
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,905
...l'm telling you.

100
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,709
Either stop your lectures or go
away. I don't like hearing...

101
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,374
...your speeches any more.

102
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,884
Would you like to
get out of Calcutta?

103
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,317
Would it be okay if I get you
a job outside Calcutta?

104
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,383
What job?
- Medical representative.

105
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:53,128
Outside Calcutta! - That's why
I didn't tell you before.

106
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,224
Dr. Suren Das. Do you know him?

107
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:00,739
National Pharmaceuticals.
I know him well.

108
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:04,065
If you want, I can
give you a letter.

109
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,014
Let me talk with him.

110
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,182
One tablet, please.

111
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,752
Can I get some water?
- Water?

112
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,764
How much?
- 60 paise.

113
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,030
What do you want?

114
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,714
The 1970-71 budget comes up
with proposals to stimulate...

115
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:55,886
...growth, export drive and import
substitution. Additional taxes...

116
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:59,055
...on certain luxury and
consumer goods and an...

117
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,725
...increase in wealth tax and
income tax rates for higher...

118
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,233
...income groups.

119
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:09,998
Relief with the rise of the
exemption limit to 5000 rupees...

120
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,010
...on income tax and a greater
sense of security to low...

121
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,013
...income groups through revised
pension proposals.

122
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,014
New taxes are expected to fetch
an additional revenue...

123
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,679
...of 1700 million rupees.

124
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,854
An explosion! Let's run!

125
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:56,446
Look what happened to this watch.
It fell from my hand.

126
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:15,195
The balance has broken.
- How much will it cost? - 850.

127
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:19,176
Okay give it to me.

128
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:22,830
The lymphatics of the female breast,
if you remember, begins...

129
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:26,844
...with the flexes around
the gland itself.

130
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:32,073
Now this flexes which we note is quite
different from the lymphatics...

131
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,348
...which drain the central
region of the gland.

132
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:40,191
But the gland at its
central region is...

133
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,862
Oh! What a beautiful place.

134
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,805
Wow! This is wonderful.

135
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,661
This is where the world started.

136
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,666
This is where the magic is.

137
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:30,827
Great.

138
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,731
Look at the cow. Delightful!

139
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,837
Wow! What a place!
- Fantastic!

140
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:43,207
We come to Calcutta and
we like every one of you people.

141
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,750
You are truly our friends.

142
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,085
Who's that?
- Open the door, this is Siddartha.

143
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,022
Who is Siddartha? - Stop playing
the fool and open the door.

144
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,699
Come in. - Where is Sibu? - He
has gone to get cigarettes...

145
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,430
...he will be back soon.

146
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,247
Oh! What a day!
- What happened?

147
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,718
What can happen? The same routine.

148
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:31,388
That's the problem. Time doesn't
want to pass at all.

149
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,229
Walking all day in the sun.

150
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,738
Tell me, what are you doing?

151
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,077
What are you doing?

152
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,081
This is a highly skilled job.

153
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,249
You're stealing the funds
meant for the Red Cross?

154
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:08,697
Hey, Siddartha. This is not
good. Give it to me.

155
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,368
Where did you think your
Red Cross got the money?

156
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,030
All day I walked in the sun.

157
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,699
Don't I have a share in it?

158
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,700
All of you... Hell! All of you.

159
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:27,049
I come here only so that I can
relax for some time and you...

160
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,211
You relax. Who is stopping you?

161
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,223
If you want to sleep
then I have a drug.

162
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,727
How low you've stooped.
- The whole country is going...

163
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,729
...down, brother. If
I don't stoop down then do...

164
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,061
...you want me suspended
in space?

165
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,226
You're already the son of rich
parents and you hail from...

166
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,293
...a famous family.

167
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,736
What do you know about my family?
Do you know about...

168
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,740
...my uncle. Do you know about
my grandpa? Moreover, what...

169
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,140
...relationship is there between
this and my family?

170
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,244
Two books have been stolen.
- What books? - Yes, the books...

171
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,751
...on those two subjects.

172
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,083
If I don't get the books then
I can't pass the exams.

173
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,418
How will I get so much money
in such a short time, now?

174
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:09,017
How does he play, Baren? - Left
out. - It's Sibhu. Open the door.

175
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,686
Kleptomaniac number one.

176
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,998
Hey, how long have you been here?
- Just now.

177
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,937
Stop standing and chatting
there. Close the door.

178
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,337
Take this.

179
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:31,379
You also have one.
- Thanks.

180
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,712
Are you still on it?

181
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:36,220
What 's wrong with this chap? It
is becoming more difficult day by day.

182
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:39,054
I'm thinking of vacating the house.

183
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:42,719
Vacating the house! He can't move
a step and he is thinking...

184
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:47,060
...of vacating the house.
- Are you his advisor? - Ask him.

185
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,225
Is that so, buddy?
- Leave that. You too!

186
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:54,201
Is that so? He is trying
to hook a girl.

187
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:59,232
He is asking me, how do I
proceed. Tell me step by step.

188
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:04,248
Listen friend, this is too much.
This is gross injustice.

189
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,682
Then what did you tell him?
- I told him...

190
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,687
Hey don't say anything. Stop.
- Leave me.

191
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,019
If you play the fool with me then
I will spill all the beans.

192
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,024
You carry on with the work.
Don't tell him anything.

193
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,219
Wait, another 2 rupees.

194
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:19,263
2 rupees, Stop all that
nonsense and do it fast.

195
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,696
Come soon, I'm getting impatient.

196
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:23,200
The delay did help. Look
at this. Some more money.

197
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,259
You can have them if you like.

198
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:33,039
What's that? - Hey. - Tell me. -
Will you lend me this? - What?

199
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:38,708
This magazine. - Buddy, this has
resale value, do you know that?

200
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,116
Ten rupees per copy.

201
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:45,714
If I give you that you'll
sell it and pocket the money.

202
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,725
Why do you take everyone
to be in your category?

203
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:52,230
Look, I don't believe
the unemployed.

204
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,062
So you don't intend
to come out it seems.

205
00:23:58,136 --> 00:24:00,229
No, sir. I've important work to do.

206
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:06,009
Hey, will you buy me lunch?
Then we'll go to a movie.

207
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:09,012
A movie again?
- Why, have you already been to one?

208
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,674
I went into a cool place and
started catching up on some sleep...

209
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,014
...and suddenly from nowhere
there was this boom.

210
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,019
A bomb! - Another explosion?
- Yes, in the Light House.

211
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:21,024
Then the movie got interrupted.
- Was anyone injured?

212
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,684
I didn't see. I walked out
and came over.

213
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,695
In our place there will
be no explosion.

214
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,697
Oh! It's your film club.

215
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:29,199
A Swedish film. No cutting.

216
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,951
Shall we go in?
- We won't get a seat.

217
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,385
Come, let's go in and see.

218
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:15,165
Let's go.

219
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,913
Without my watch,
I can't keep track of the time.

220
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,007
Why? Are you in a hurry
to go somewhere?

221
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,018
I've to meet Naresh Pal.

222
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,344
Are you trying to get into politics?

223
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,015
Only that's not included.

224
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,692
Then why go to brother Naresh?

225
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,025
His friend seems to have a
pharmaceuticals company...

226
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,032
...and probably is hiring people.
He'll give me a letter.

227
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,034
Let me see.

228
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,866
I don't understand your situation
at all. Your sister got a job...

229
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,031
...but you're not able to find one.

230
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:53,043
Have you seen my sister?
- Have I not?

231
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,704
Then? Why wouldn't she get a job?

232
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:59,716
Academic qualification is
not the only qualification.

233
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,052
In that case what is wrong with
your personality? It has...

234
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,989
...the stamp of intelligence.
- Who wants intelligence?

235
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,151
You understand everything
and pretend to be a fool.

236
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,195
These days the weaker sex
is the stronger sex.

237
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,264
Have you seen how confidently
they walk?

238
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,656
There you're right.

239
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,669
At times they give us
an inferiority complex.

240
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:24,175
Do you know? If I do something
then I'll get a job.

241
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:29,343
I have to answer the questions in
the interview in a calculated manner.

242
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,317
To date I haven't done
those calculations.

243
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,181
From now on I'll do that.

244
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:44,019
For the last year
I've had these doubts.

245
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:47,121
I was only waiting for proof.

246
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:50,895
If I hadn't gotten proof then
I wouldn't have come to you.

247
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:56,373
I have come so that you
can know about it.

248
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:01,201
I don't know what impression you've
gotten about your daughter.

249
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,715
I don't know how you've
brought her up.

250
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:14,651
She has destroyed my house, my
family and shattered it.

251
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:26,667
I've endured this enough. No more.
I can't. I can't bear it...

252
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:30,174
...anymore. Whatever it may be,
you  find a solution for this.

253
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:37,670
Otherwise I will have to do
something about it myself.

254
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,683
What's the matter?

255
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,688
Why are all of you so gloomy?

256
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:57,024
Is your interview over?
- Forget my interview.

257
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,297
Who was that woman?

258
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,700
Mama!

259
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,970
Who?
- Ask him.

260
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,979
Uncle.

261
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:14,649
Mrs. Sanyal. - Who is she? - Wife
of Topu's boss, who else?

262
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:18,649
Did she come complaining about her?

263
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,247
It's ten and still she is not home.
What else will she do?

264
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:22,657
Does that mean that she's doing
something with her boss?

265
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:24,661
It could be the pressure of work.

266
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:26,993
If there is the pressure of work
then why doesn't she inform us...

267
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,158
...when she's leaving the office?

268
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:35,002
How long can a woman wait alone?

269
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:37,007
That is different. But if you tell
me that you believe that...

270
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,272
neurotic woman, then I will
portray a different character.

271
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,670
Just like that a woman can walk
in and talk all rubbish...

272
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:46,683
...about my sister, this
will not be tolerated.

273
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,015
I'm telling you all one more thing.
Don't bring up this...

274
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,180
...topic at all when Topu
comes back from work.

275
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:53,019
All these problems come
looking for us. That is no evidence.

276
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,250
Now the boss's wife comes
complaining about her.

277
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,088
It is all because of you. If the
daughter has some pressure...

278
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,355
...then what is the son's excuse?
Can't he come home early?

279
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,027
Maybe he is going for his studies.

280
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,295
But all I know is that he
has stopped his studies.

281
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:18,202
Still he may be doing some studies.
He was the best boy in his class.

282
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:21,837
He will not remain the best boy for long.

283
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:27,208
Politics is not for students.
There is a time for everything.

284
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:32,881
You stay in the house
because you like it.

285
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,022
What happened?

286
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,862
You had an interview?

287
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,868
Tell me how it went.

288
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,877
I will not.

289
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,880
Tell me.

290
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:38,051
Why were you late coming
home today? - I will not tell.

291
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,059
My not telling you and
your telling are not the same.

292
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,721
No one comes here and
spreads scandal about me.

293
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:50,061
Oh! What did that woman say?

294
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:54,067
Did you know that woman would come?
- No.

295
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:58,074
I've heard about her and know what
type of a woman she is. - I see.

296
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,734
What did she say, let me know.

297
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,405
I only heard the last
of it and that's enough.

298
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,744
Don't you know what was discussed?
- No, and that is not the issue.

299
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:10,687
How would I know?
I'm not responsible.

300
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,017
Are you not responsible?

301
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,024
Not at all.

302
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,852
Okay. You may not be the
person to blame but...

303
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,195
...someone is to blame
which you're not disclosing.

304
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,359
But if he is responsible
then straighten it out.

305
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,027
How?
- There are many ways to do that.

306
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:33,033
For example he can be
given a good thrashing.

307
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,102
I feel like laughing
when you talk of thrashing.

308
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:42,719
You don't have to laugh now,
I'm dead serious.

309
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,051
What's the advantage in thrashing
an innocent person like him?

310
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:48,058
Innocent! A manager in such a
big private firm and innocent?

311
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:49,889
Whom are you fooling?

312
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:53,059
Okay, then do whatever you like.

313
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,733
Aren't you feeling bad about it at all?

314
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:00,896
Can't you see how ugly the issue is?

315
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:04,066
Aren't you able to sense how
mama must be feeling about it?

316
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,076
Does mama want me to leave the job?

317
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:11,010
Naturally. Anyway, the job keeps
you working till ten at night.

318
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,344
...you must leave that job anyhow.

319
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,182
Today the office closed at
five thirty. - Five thirty?

320
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:21,021
Yes, He took me to
Narendrapur to see his new house.

321
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:24,027
He, meaning your boss?
- Yes. - Why?

322
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:27,697
There were three others with us.

323
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:29,699
Why did you go to see that house?

324
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,701
What do you mean by why?
He called me so I went.

325
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:34,203
After a hard day's work?

326
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:39,104
What can I do? - What do
you mean by what you can do?

327
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,872
Can't you refuse to go?
- No.

328
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:49,219
What do you mean by no? Is
it some slavery or compulsion?

329
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:55,382
Starting next month I'm becoming
the boss's PA. 200 rupees increment.

330
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,894
The rascal is taking advantage of that.

331
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:03,056
That bloody son of a pig and a scoundrel.

332
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,226
Brother!

333
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:08,171
Brother, what a beautiful bird this is.

334
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,167
Where?

335
00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:16,736
There!

336
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:25,745
Wonderful!

337
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:29,020
What's the name of that bird?

338
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,196
Let me freshen up first. I'll
take exactly five minutes.

339
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,763
Don't get worked up over everything.
- Okay.

340
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:42,863
Tell me first, how was the interview?

341
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,038
Horrible.

342
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:51,104
Topu?

343
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,875
Is  your boss staying in Alipore?

344
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,050
I won't say.

345
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,006
What happened?
- Nothing.

346
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:23,012
A fight.

347
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,082
Do you have a cut?
- Something like that.

348
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,705
Listen.

349
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:54,034
Do you have some money?

350
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,877
Why?
- I need it.

351
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,716
What for?

352
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:05,716
I have to finish someone.
An antisocial element.

353
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:09,987
Why ask me? Go and make your own.

354
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:14,824
It is necessary. Otherwise
the crisis will worsen.

355
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,835
Crisis!
- Nothing political.

356
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,996
You have become strange.

357
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,008
Always searching for a job has
turned your life into something.

358
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,839
Let me do what I'm doing.

359
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,004
Have I ever lectured on
anything concerning you?

360
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,874
Do you remember this?

361
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:38,848
You gave this to me.

362
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:46,853
You don't know that I had to
sell two medical books to buy this.

363
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:51,030
You don't know how much
you've changed in these two years.

364
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:55,698
Two years ago I didn't need a job.
- Job?

365
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,037
Do you know what will be
your condition if you get a job?

366
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,103
I will be a copier in
the bureaucratic machine.

367
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,806
I feel when I think about that.

368
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:09,151
You know very well what
you're doing is not correct.

369
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,983
Getting a job is not my ambition.

370
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:16,823
But can one only follow a single path?

371
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,987
Exactly, that is what is required.

372
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,223
You don't have a path at all.

373
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,163
You yourself don't know
which way you want to go.

374
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,827
You're standing in one place
and wasting your time chatting.

375
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:27,826
Tonu.

376
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:33,169
Do you remember that bird?

377
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,833
Bird!
- Let it be.

378
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,735
You're not supposed to know it.

379
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:18,215
Whom do you want?
- Is Mr. Sanyal home?

380
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:19,874
This slip...
- Okay.

381
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,761
Come inside and sit down.

382
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,751
Why are you standing? Sit down.

383
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:12,354
Are you Sutopa's brother?
- Yes.

384
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:17,199
Is she sick?

385
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:22,205
No, but she is feeling the strain.

386
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,774
Feeling the strain?

387
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,700
Yes.

388
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,313
Your sis, she says that she
is feeling the strain?

389
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:35,047
No, but we can tell.

390
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,710
She is getting frail.

391
00:42:39,123 --> 00:42:42,718
But I didn't notice that.

392
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:46,889
You always see her
hence you may not have noticed.

393
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,893
Doesn't the word 'always'
sound a little aggressive?

394
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:53,235
Anyway, we can tell.

395
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:01,744
Whatever you're trying to
say if you don't say it...

396
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:04,246
...clearly it's difficult
to understand.

397
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,851
She never told me that
she is feeling the strain.

398
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,856
In fact, she seems quite happy.

399
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:27,700
She is very smart, hard
working. As for overtime...

400
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:32,708
...she may have had to do it for a
few days, that I don't deny...

401
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:36,109
...but doing it for more
than one hour, I don't think so.

402
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,778
Have you gotten a job?

403
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,729
Instead of your sister
leaving her job wouldn't...

404
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,064
...it be better that you find a job?

405
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,900
In your company.

406
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,206
No, I can recommend somewhere else.

407
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:10,007
You sit down. I'm due to
get a trunk call at ten.

408
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,841
You wait and I'll give you a letter.

409
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:44,041
Who? Yes, I'm well.

410
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:50,084
Hello. This is me, Sanyal speaking.

411
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:53,052
Yes. Oh no.

412
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,052
I've told him already.

413
00:44:57,795 --> 00:44:59,729
Everything is settled.

414
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:33,027
Catch that fellow.

415
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:38,030
He hit the child.

416
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,035
Catch him and beat him.

417
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:32,845
Why did you stop
studying to be a doctor?

418
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:35,187
There was problem in the house.

419
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:41,191
Naresh has written to
medical representatives...

420
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:44,859
...but there are no vacancies for medical
representatives at present. We...

421
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,204
...are taking salesmen. - Salesman! -
It seems your heart is sad.

422
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:52,871
I started as a salesman myself.

423
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:56,035
If you work properly there is always
the opportunity to prosper in a job.

424
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:01,876
Are you thinking that
you're to carry medicines...

425
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:03,886
...in a bag and move like a hawker?
- Is that not so?

426
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:07,314
No, it's not like that.

427
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:11,657
Actually what you've to do
is go to hospitals...

428
00:47:11,728 --> 00:47:14,822
...and dispensaries and note down
their requirements in a note book.

429
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:18,660
There is a lot of traveling.

430
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:22,000
From a central place
you travel around 70 to 80 miles daily.

431
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:30,012
Where is the place?

432
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,674
Balurghat. Do you know?
It's in west Dinajpur.

433
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:41,087
The fact is that I don't want
to leave Calcutta at present.

434
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:46,858
That you decide. I can give you
around ten days to make up your mind.

435
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:54,032
Yes, Siddartha.

436
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:02,211
It seems you have left
everything at its pace.

437
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,714
What to say? It seems that
I'm to leave Calcutta at last.

438
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,814
Why are you bothered about that?

439
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:15,655
You say that you like it outside Calcutta.

440
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,819
That is when I go to
places like Deohargh...

441
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,664
...and spend a vacation
there for 15 to 20 days.

442
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,667
But this is not like that.

443
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:28,068
It is some corner of the world...

444
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:30,072
...and that too as a medical
salesman. I don't like it.

445
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,734
I don't know about you but...

446
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:38,170
...I can't even stay for
a minute outside Calcutta.

447
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,683
I know.

448
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:47,690
There is something about the city.

449
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,855
Tell me what it is?

450
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:53,861
It's life.

451
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,024
It may be a tough life but we like it.

452
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:02,868
In other places either
you're dead or you're burnt out.

453
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,635
What a condition. When I think of
leaving Calcutta I feel sick...

454
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,304
...however they will
not permit us to stay here.

455
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:13,649
Tunu is right.

456
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,982
There is no way out
other than a revolution.

457
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,986
You will start a revolution.
- No, I will not but...

458
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,822
...if it starts then I will fight in it.

459
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:27,824
Will you fire a gun? Will
you throw hand grenades?

460
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:32,058
At times when my head gets hot...

461
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:37,173
...then I think that I should do all that.

462
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:50,474
It is all your imagination. When...

463
00:49:51,152 --> 00:49:54,588
...it comes to actually doing it
you will not be able to do anything.

464
00:49:54,655 --> 00:49:59,422
You feel that way? - There
are two types of human beings.

465
00:50:01,262 --> 00:50:04,425
Thinkers who only think.

466
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:09,432
Then there are the
doers who can only do.

467
00:50:09,604 --> 00:50:14,439
I'm the second type. I'm not
into thinking and all that.

468
00:50:14,509 --> 00:50:17,501
I'll do what has to be done.

469
00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:22,445
You will only think about
that which you'll not do.

470
00:50:23,184 --> 00:50:25,175
Siddartha!

471
00:50:25,453 --> 00:50:28,286
At the moment I'm thinking where
to eat. That too from your money.

472
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:33,286
Leave that to me, brother.

473
00:50:34,195 --> 00:50:36,459
Hey, what are you doing?

474
00:50:37,198 --> 00:50:40,133
The growth of my moustache is uneven.

475
00:50:40,201 --> 00:50:43,295
I'm doing a little makeup to hide that.

476
00:50:43,371 --> 00:50:46,465
Both of you are having fun.

477
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:50,136
Only these few months, brother.

478
00:50:50,211 --> 00:50:53,476
Then we will cease to be students.

479
00:50:53,548 --> 00:50:56,642
You think that he won't come?
- No chance at all.

480
00:50:56,717 --> 00:51:00,153
He has fallen deeply in love.

481
00:51:00,221 --> 00:51:02,553
Otherwise why go to his cousin
sister's house seven days a week?

482
00:51:07,161 --> 00:51:09,493
Is he proceeding as per your house?

483
00:51:11,165 --> 00:51:13,599
His cousin has two friends.

484
00:51:13,668 --> 00:51:17,263
Siben has an eye on one of them.

485
00:51:17,338 --> 00:51:20,501
Must be Gayatri. That girl has nothing in her.

486
00:51:20,575 --> 00:51:23,271
She has nothing.

487
00:51:24,512 --> 00:51:26,605
Do you serve monkey's brain here?
- No we don't serve monkey brains here.

488
00:51:26,681 --> 00:51:28,512
You get that in Hong Kong.

489
00:51:28,583 --> 00:51:33,680
If you try something strange and
unique, the bill will be high.

490
00:51:33,754 --> 00:51:35,517
Will mixed fried rice be okay with you?
- Yes, order that.

491
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:38,115
Then half a plate mixed fried rice.

492
00:51:38,192 --> 00:51:41,457
Do you have egg foo yoong?

493
00:51:41,529 --> 00:51:43,463
Yes we serve egg foo yoong.
- Good.

494
00:51:43,531 --> 00:51:47,490
But first whisky and soda.
- There are two kind of whisky.

495
00:51:47,568 --> 00:51:52,130
Do you have Aristocrat?
- Yes. - OK. That will do.

496
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:05,144
Oh! You're a teetotaler, aren't you?
Or have you just started?

497
00:52:05,253 --> 00:52:09,417
Not yet but I think I'll start today.

498
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:12,584
Don't think a lot, otherwise
everything will get spoiled.

499
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:15,094
Where did you learn to drink alcohol?

500
00:52:15,162 --> 00:52:18,097
What is there to learn?
It is hereditary.

501
00:52:18,165 --> 00:52:20,497
Does your father drink?
- Of course.

502
00:52:20,568 --> 00:52:23,264
Not the medical dosage but a full dose.

503
00:52:23,337 --> 00:52:25,100
Why do you think that all
doctors are like Morarji Desai?

504
00:52:25,172 --> 00:52:27,106
Not so. But your father.

505
00:52:27,174 --> 00:52:31,440
This is a silly stupid notion
of all of you.

506
00:52:31,512 --> 00:52:35,505
Inside every human being there
are ten contradictory characters.

507
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:39,451
That's true, otherwise how
can you be good at studies too?

508
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,283
That's fate.

509
00:52:47,295 --> 00:52:52,289
Listen, if you have to fire the gun then...

510
00:52:52,366 --> 00:52:55,130
...go ahead and have it. Cheers!

511
00:53:05,146 --> 00:53:07,478
Are you in a hurry to get back home?
- Why?

512
00:53:08,749 --> 00:53:11,240
Then I shall take you someplace.

513
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:14,482
Where?
- You'll see when you get there.

514
00:53:16,157 --> 00:53:18,421
It is not what you're thinking.

515
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:23,424
Looking at you one can sense
that you're thinking something.

516
00:53:23,497 --> 00:53:27,433
What is it? About a job?
- Hell! No.

517
00:53:28,169 --> 00:53:31,161
Can one think about a job always?

518
00:53:33,274 --> 00:53:38,177
Do we get birds in New Market?
- Birds?

519
00:53:38,446 --> 00:53:42,610
You mean chickens.
- No, chicken you can get in any market.

520
00:53:43,284 --> 00:53:48,119
What bird?
- I don't remember the name.

521
00:53:48,289 --> 00:53:51,281
But I can recognise its call
if I hear it.

522
00:54:31,165 --> 00:54:34,100
Can you recognise the call in this chorus?

523
00:54:34,268 --> 00:54:36,099
Listen, what bird are you looking for?

524
00:54:36,437 --> 00:54:39,304
What?
- What bird are you looking for?

525
00:54:39,373 --> 00:54:42,433
Tell him. - I don't know the
name but I recognise the call.

526
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:44,603
Talking bird?
- No, not a talking bird.

527
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:49,275
Not a talking bird but it sings very well.

528
00:54:49,784 --> 00:54:52,184
Whistle the tune for him.

529
00:55:04,298 --> 00:55:07,233
What's the matter?
- This is the place.

530
00:55:07,301 --> 00:55:09,394
Come.

531
00:55:10,137 --> 00:55:13,402
Do we have to go upstairs? - Yes, of
course there is nothing downstairs.

532
00:55:19,146 --> 00:55:23,139
Adina! Let's drop it.
- Why?

533
00:55:23,584 --> 00:55:27,247
I feel uncomfortable about the whole thing.

534
00:55:28,422 --> 00:55:31,414
Why are you behaving childishly?

535
00:55:31,492 --> 00:55:36,156
I give you my word you'll not regret it.

536
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:39,427
Now come along.

537
00:56:12,399 --> 00:56:14,663
Can I come in?
- No, you can't.

538
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:24,672
Come.

539
00:56:25,746 --> 00:56:28,237
You can call her my friend and...

540
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:31,584
...also call her my teacher.

541
00:56:32,153 --> 00:56:36,089
A very private tutor, aren't you?

542
00:56:38,259 --> 00:56:40,250
Sit down. Why are you standing?

543
00:56:40,594 --> 00:56:44,086
Sit down. Make yourself at home.

544
00:56:54,775 --> 00:56:57,266
Today was hard work.

545
00:56:57,344 --> 00:57:00,507
An 80 year old man. Refuses to die.

546
00:57:00,581 --> 00:57:03,448
If you do the nursing then why
would anybody want to die?

547
00:57:03,517 --> 00:57:06,384
What do you say?

548
00:57:07,454 --> 00:57:10,048
I'll have some water.

549
00:57:10,124 --> 00:57:12,115
Can't you get it yourself?

550
00:57:12,193 --> 00:57:14,457
Get it dear. I've walked a lot.

551
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:18,064
Will you also have some?

552
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:27,065
Did you see her hair? Priceless.

553
00:57:41,422 --> 00:57:43,583
I've never seen your friend before.

554
00:57:43,657 --> 00:57:48,492
He has just come from Patna.

555
00:57:48,762 --> 00:57:51,424
Why is he so quiet?

556
00:57:52,499 --> 00:57:56,094
He is terrified at seeing
the condition of Calcutta.

557
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,431
That's why I told him to come along.

558
00:58:02,176 --> 00:58:05,373
You have to give me five minutes.
I need to take a shower.

559
00:58:05,446 --> 00:58:07,539
It's so hot.

560
00:58:09,116 --> 00:58:12,381
If it becomes five and half
then it will be a problem.

561
00:58:15,389 --> 00:58:18,449
You're smoking all alone.
Give me one too.

562
00:58:21,562 --> 00:58:25,396
She wants a cigarette.
I'm totally out.

563
00:58:42,249 --> 00:58:44,410
Won't you light
the cigarette for me?

564
00:58:45,486 --> 00:58:47,477
Manners. Manners.

565
00:58:58,432 --> 00:59:00,423
Thank you.

566
00:59:04,438 --> 00:59:05,530
I'll be back soon.

567
00:59:06,206 --> 00:59:08,367
My friend is losing patience.

568
00:59:08,709 --> 00:59:11,439
I think he doesn't like me at all.

569
00:59:11,512 --> 00:59:13,377
Nonsense.

570
00:59:13,447 --> 00:59:17,042
His hunger is reflecting on his face.

571
00:59:19,219 --> 00:59:22,450
Well brother, she is all yours.

572
00:59:22,523 --> 00:59:24,457
You told me this is not like that.

573
00:59:24,525 --> 00:59:27,221
Whatever you're thinking this is
not... - Whatever I'm thinking is right.

574
00:59:27,294 --> 00:59:29,558
Nobody comes here to think.

575
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:32,064
Disgusting!

576
00:59:32,132 --> 00:59:36,068
You had some alcohol. Did
you feel bad after that?

577
00:59:36,136 --> 00:59:41,073
This is also like that.
Initially it may be sour.

578
00:59:41,141 --> 00:59:44,406
Then after that...
- Listen, come here.

579
00:59:44,478 --> 00:59:47,276
What happened?
- Come here for a moment.

580
00:59:47,414 --> 00:59:50,406
I'm not able to detach the hook.

581
00:59:50,684 --> 00:59:52,481
I'll be back.

582
00:59:54,421 --> 00:59:57,083
Ready, steady, go.

583
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:04,256
You play now.
- You wait.

584
01:00:19,613 --> 01:00:22,514
Hey, Siddartha!

585
01:00:22,583 --> 01:00:24,278
Hey, Siddartha!

586
01:00:25,185 --> 01:00:28,518
Hey, Siddartha!

587
01:01:02,222 --> 01:01:04,486
Hey Mister.

588
01:01:05,492 --> 01:01:07,426
This side.

589
01:01:10,264 --> 01:01:12,095
Will you come and listen to me?

590
01:01:19,506 --> 01:01:21,440
What's the matter?

591
01:01:22,176 --> 01:01:24,610
Can you repair a fuse?
- Fuse?

592
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:29,445
All the lights in the house have gone off.

593
01:01:29,783 --> 01:01:33,446
There is nobody at home.
I'm feeling very scared.

594
01:01:35,289 --> 01:01:38,622
I can give it a try.
- Please come in.

595
01:01:38,792 --> 01:01:42,125
My papa is not here and
the servant has also gone out.

596
01:01:42,196 --> 01:01:45,131
Where is the main?
- There, please come with me.

597
01:01:45,532 --> 01:01:49,127
I don't have a torch or candle at home.

598
01:01:49,203 --> 01:01:51,535
I mean... There, the middle one.

599
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:57,473
I brought the fuse wire. I
thought that I'll try it myself.

600
01:01:57,544 --> 01:01:59,535
Then I felt nervous.

601
01:02:00,214 --> 01:02:02,307
Give me the wire.

602
01:02:03,217 --> 01:02:05,549
Hold the match light for me.

603
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:17,093
My hands and feet went cold in fear.

604
01:02:18,765 --> 01:02:21,427
That's when I got
desperate and called to you.

605
01:02:21,502 --> 01:02:23,094
Oh, sorry!

606
01:02:37,518 --> 01:02:40,510
Thank god!
- My hands.

607
01:02:42,189 --> 01:02:44,123
You want to wash your hands, come.

608
01:02:50,197 --> 01:02:52,529
When I went to light the stove...

609
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:01,133
Sit down.

610
01:04:02,736 --> 01:04:05,136
Was this necessary?
- Why not?

611
01:04:05,472 --> 01:04:07,463
Do you recognize me?

612
01:04:10,143 --> 01:04:12,077
At first I didn't.

613
01:04:12,145 --> 01:04:14,079
We met in your cousin's place.

614
01:04:14,147 --> 01:04:16,411
Oh yes, Aruna. Now I remember.

615
01:04:16,483 --> 01:04:21,477
We study together. I'm Keya
Mukherjee. - Siddartha Choudhury.

616
01:04:25,158 --> 01:04:28,093
I've seen you pass along
this road a lot of times.

617
01:04:29,162 --> 01:04:33,428
You put on a serious face
gazing at the road while walking.

618
01:04:39,506 --> 01:04:42,270
How long have you been in this area?

619
01:04:42,342 --> 01:04:45,106
Around one and half years.
We were in Delhi before.

620
01:04:45,178 --> 01:04:47,612
Papa got transferred here.

621
01:04:53,787 --> 01:04:57,450
It was a very odd way that I called you.

622
01:04:58,292 --> 01:05:02,126
My mind was confused and afraid.

623
01:05:02,195 --> 01:05:06,723
Today the servant
chose to go to the cinema.

624
01:05:13,473 --> 01:05:16,067
Now I'll take leave.

625
01:05:17,244 --> 01:05:19,405
Don't misunderstand me, please.

626
01:05:19,479 --> 01:05:21,413
Not at all. Why do you unnecessarily...

627
01:05:21,581 --> 01:05:23,242
Come some other day.

628
01:05:25,419 --> 01:05:29,082
Since you pass by here
just drop in any day.

629
01:05:29,156 --> 01:05:33,490
Okay. - If you come tomorrow
evening then I'll serve you tea.

630
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:37,428
and something to go along with that also.
- Let me see. If I can, I'll come.

631
01:05:38,165 --> 01:05:40,429
Okay, I'll take leave.

632
01:05:57,517 --> 01:05:59,610
Is that Monu? Have you come home?

633
01:06:12,232 --> 01:06:16,396
Interview.

634
01:06:17,571 --> 01:06:22,406
When will all this end? They have
brought disrepute to my daughter.

635
01:06:22,476 --> 01:06:26,139
This must be what
enemies have done to us.

636
01:06:26,213 --> 01:06:28,078
It is better I die than live like this.

637
01:06:28,148 --> 01:06:30,412
Really, I don't like this at all.

638
01:06:43,263 --> 01:06:45,163
I went to your boss's house today.

639
01:06:48,168 --> 01:06:50,261
I went to your boss's house today.

640
01:06:50,437 --> 01:06:53,429
I heard.
- Don't you believe it?

641
01:06:55,175 --> 01:06:58,269
Hey Topu, don't you believe it?

642
01:06:59,179 --> 01:07:01,272
Yes.

643
01:07:07,387 --> 01:07:11,380
I told him that she'll not work any
more since she's feeling the strain.

644
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:15,060
I told him that every day
it is 8 to 9 when she returns...

645
01:07:15,128 --> 01:07:17,392
...and she is not the
type who can express herself.

646
01:07:17,464 --> 01:07:21,059
It is too much for her. Some
day she might have a breakdown...

647
01:07:21,134 --> 01:07:24,467
...hence it is better that she leaves now.

648
01:07:25,405 --> 01:07:30,240
He also agreed to that. He said if
that's the decision then he has...

649
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:34,406
...nothing to say about it. He said,
she's smart, hardworking.

650
01:07:34,481 --> 01:07:39,418
He praised you a lot.

651
01:07:41,154 --> 01:07:44,282
Don't you believe me?
- No.

652
01:07:48,428 --> 01:07:52,091
Even if it is true, still I'm
not going to leave the job.

653
01:07:52,165 --> 01:07:54,429
No one can force me to do that.

654
01:07:55,168 --> 01:07:59,764
I will tell that to him myself tomorrow.

655
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,102
If he behaves badly with you,
still you'll not leave the job?

656
01:08:01,174 --> 01:08:02,436
We'll see about that when he does.

657
01:08:02,509 --> 01:08:05,103
His wife came and said so many
things. - She will. She is a mental case.

658
01:08:08,548 --> 01:08:10,038
What about mother? - What about her?

659
01:08:10,116 --> 01:08:13,051
Is it that her daughter
is earning disrepute?

660
01:08:13,653 --> 01:08:16,383
Is that nothing to you?
Nothing at all?

661
01:08:20,126 --> 01:08:23,061
Brother, how would it be
if I get into modeling?

662
01:08:23,129 --> 01:08:25,393
Modeling?

663
01:08:32,138 --> 01:08:34,072
This modeling and you'll do it?

664
01:08:35,141 --> 01:08:38,599
This is a good profession.
They pay you well.

665
01:08:38,678 --> 01:08:42,478
These days quite a lot
of people are doing it.

666
01:08:42,582 --> 01:08:45,415
Suppose they ask you to
wear some atrocious outfit?

667
01:08:45,485 --> 01:08:48,079
Atrocious? What do you mean? - I
mean as good as not wearing anything.

668
01:08:48,154 --> 01:08:50,418
What's wrong in that?
My figure is so bad?

669
01:08:58,164 --> 01:09:01,429
Brother. Come to the terrace.

670
01:09:01,501 --> 01:09:03,435
Terrace?
- Come.

671
01:09:05,205 --> 01:09:09,369
What's the matter? - Put on
the light. - Light? - Put in on.

672
01:09:49,149 --> 01:09:52,585
I'm learning dancing.
- When?

673
01:09:54,254 --> 01:09:57,417
In the evening, after work.

674
01:10:31,524 --> 01:10:36,461
You've changed.

675
01:10:37,297 --> 01:10:41,131
Everyone changes.
You've also changed.

676
01:11:00,487 --> 01:11:03,479
Are you going somewhere?
- I want to.

677
01:11:04,224 --> 01:11:08,251
Where?
- Out of town.

678
01:11:08,328 --> 01:11:12,594
Out of town, means?
- Out of town. - Out of town?

679
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,092
Out of town.

680
01:11:21,508 --> 01:11:25,444
There's a problem getting
a proper reply from you.

681
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:39,454
Can you give me ten rupees?

682
01:11:39,526 --> 01:11:43,292
I seem to have lost my purse.
- Why ask me for money?

683
01:11:43,363 --> 01:11:45,456
Ask the one who is earning.

684
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:49,532
She doesn't give. A miser.
I asked her a few times before too.

685
01:11:50,804 --> 01:11:52,533
Can I know where you're going?

686
01:11:53,206 --> 01:11:56,471
I told you. To the village.

687
01:11:56,643 --> 01:11:58,474
Why are you asking?

688
01:11:59,212 --> 01:12:01,476
Do you have any interest in this?
- I may have.

689
01:12:01,548 --> 01:12:04,483
After all, you're my brother.

690
01:12:05,485 --> 01:12:07,419
It would have been helpful
had I got the money.

691
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:18,253
If I had the money then I
would've repaired my watch.

692
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,431
Care for a cigarette?

693
01:12:23,169 --> 01:12:25,262
I don't smoke.

694
01:12:36,182 --> 01:12:39,117
Have you decided that
you'll not take the exams?

695
01:12:39,285 --> 01:12:43,119
Suddenly?
- I was thinking about your future.

696
01:12:43,523 --> 01:12:45,787
You don't have to think about my future.

697
01:12:49,529 --> 01:12:51,292
Are you into the revolution?

698
01:12:51,364 --> 01:12:54,458
Whatever, I will not announce it to you.

699
01:12:56,536 --> 01:12:59,471
Do you know?

700
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,631
You may be killed by a police bullet.

701
01:13:02,709 --> 01:13:07,237
What do you think?

702
01:13:09,249 --> 01:13:11,410
Brother, come here and see.
- What is it? - Come and see.

703
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:35,430
In your childhood you...

704
01:13:36,509 --> 01:13:40,104
...used to see chickens being killed.

705
01:13:41,447 --> 01:13:46,111
What is proved by that? Chicken
meat has always been my favorite.

706
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,283
What next?
- I don't know.

707
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:52,454
Then?

708
01:13:53,193 --> 01:13:55,457
In the olden days do you
know how the public was?

709
01:13:56,462 --> 01:13:59,124
When the widows were burnt alive...

710
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,636
... so many people watched the fun.

711
01:14:05,471 --> 01:14:07,234
In the times of the French revolution
when the aristocrats were caught and...

712
01:14:07,307 --> 01:14:11,073
...beheaded in the guillotine
many people stood and watched.

713
01:14:11,144 --> 01:14:15,080
They placed the head below and...

714
01:14:15,148 --> 01:14:17,082
...then released the thing
from the top. That's all.

715
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:56,693
You!

716
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,654
Hey, are you unwell?

717
01:18:17,557 --> 01:18:19,047
No. I'm well

718
01:18:20,226 --> 01:18:22,387
Why are you saying you're well?

719
01:18:22,462 --> 01:18:24,555
What time is it?

720
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:28,663
Why do you ask?

721
01:18:29,135 --> 01:18:32,468
What time will it be?

722
01:18:32,538 --> 01:18:35,405
It will be ten. The
radio stopped just now.

723
01:18:36,142 --> 01:18:38,406
How can your head be all right?

724
01:18:39,245 --> 01:18:44,410
You walk a lot in the
sun and then get sick.

725
01:18:49,489 --> 01:18:54,256
How are you? - Today I'm well. -
What do you mean by 'today I'm well'?

726
01:18:54,327 --> 01:18:57,262
Yesterday I had a sudden fever.

727
01:18:57,330 --> 01:19:00,094
What? - Yes, that's why I
couldn't come yesterday.

728
01:19:02,168 --> 01:19:04,261
Oh, I had invited
you yesterday, didn't I?

729
01:19:05,438 --> 01:19:09,602
My friend suddenly landed yesterday
I went to see a movie with her.

730
01:19:10,209 --> 01:19:12,700
Lucky that you didn't come.

731
01:19:13,713 --> 01:19:18,377
What movie? - Useless. Elvis
Presley. He is her favorite.

732
01:19:19,118 --> 01:19:21,052
Will you have some tea?

733
01:19:26,559 --> 01:19:29,050
Did the fuse burst again?
- What?

734
01:19:30,129 --> 01:19:32,723
Did the fuse burst again?
- No.

735
01:19:32,798 --> 01:19:36,234
How funny it was that day!
- Yes, more like fiction.

736
01:19:36,302 --> 01:19:38,236
It's of course as you said.

737
01:19:40,473 --> 01:19:44,068
There is something wrong with you.
- No. You can tell me if you are sick.

738
01:19:44,143 --> 01:19:49,479
I know medicine too.
- What? Are you a doctor?

739
01:19:49,549 --> 01:19:53,076
I was almost one and
then I didn't. - Meaning?

740
01:19:54,153 --> 01:19:57,088
I studied for two years
and then dropped out. - Why?

741
01:19:57,156 --> 01:20:00,421
My father died and then...

742
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:03,424
My father has come it seems.

743
01:20:06,766 --> 01:20:10,429
Papa, my friend
Siddartha Choudhury. Papa. Aunt.

744
01:20:12,171 --> 01:20:14,264
Do you have some
medicine for a headache?

745
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:17,503
Let me see. - I don't
need anything, dear. - Why?

746
01:20:17,577 --> 01:20:20,512
All the way you were complaining
of a headache and now you say this.

747
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:23,447
It's a like headache.
- It won't do you any harm.

748
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:34,286
Sit down.

749
01:20:42,735 --> 01:20:45,465
Do you study with Kuku?
- No.

750
01:20:46,205 --> 01:20:49,800
Whose procession was
it today? Which party?

751
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:52,639
Do you know?
- I don't know?

752
01:20:52,712 --> 01:20:55,476
We were stranded in
one place for an hour.

753
01:20:55,548 --> 01:20:58,483
We just couldn't move.
- Where was it?

754
01:20:58,651 --> 01:21:01,142
Where was it? Tell me.

755
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:04,485
Kyd street.
- No, not Kyd street.

756
01:21:04,557 --> 01:21:07,253
Then why do you ask me? You know
I don't have any road sense.

757
01:21:08,494 --> 01:21:11,429
I had it somewhere and
it took me time to find it.

758
01:21:12,164 --> 01:21:15,429
Such a big tablet. I can't swallow it.

759
01:21:15,501 --> 01:21:17,435
It will not go down my throat at all.

760
01:21:17,503 --> 01:21:19,596
What tablet, let me see.
- Saridon.

761
01:21:22,775 --> 01:21:24,504
Have this.

762
01:21:34,186 --> 01:21:38,122
The mechanism of swallowing
or dignitation as we call it...

763
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:42,286
...is a complicated but a
very interesting process.

764
01:21:43,195 --> 01:21:46,187
Well, it really starts with the
action of... - Have you swallowed it?

765
01:22:00,746 --> 01:22:03,476
What are you doing? Studying?
- No.

766
01:22:04,216 --> 01:22:08,243
Have you finished your studies?
- Yes.

767
01:22:08,421 --> 01:22:12,084
Are you employed?
- No, But I will be soon.

768
01:22:12,425 --> 01:22:15,417
Why are the young men in
this condition these days?

769
01:22:17,163 --> 01:22:21,259
Where are they off to?
What do they want?

770
01:22:21,434 --> 01:22:23,493
Frustration starts at
a young age for them.

771
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:30,268
There is an age for frustration.
Once they work hard in life...

772
01:22:31,444 --> 01:22:36,438
...and when they don't get the desired
results then frustration starts.

773
01:22:36,515 --> 01:22:38,449
You're all still students.
It is madness.

774
01:22:39,285 --> 01:22:43,119
Why is this happening?

775
01:22:43,456 --> 01:22:46,289
Where is all this unrest leading to?

776
01:22:46,359 --> 01:22:49,192
Papa, I'm going out.
- Where? - Just like that.

777
01:22:49,261 --> 01:22:52,628
Will you take the car?
- No, I'll go by the bus. Come.

778
01:23:02,541 --> 01:23:04,634
Papa talks a lot.

779
01:23:05,244 --> 01:23:07,678
At that age all of us might
talk like that. You don't know.

780
01:23:09,148 --> 01:23:12,242
I hope not. I feel bad about it.

781
01:23:13,152 --> 01:23:16,417
What is the meaning in seeing
the darker side of everything?

782
01:23:25,698 --> 01:23:29,429
I like this a lot. In the car
you feel very closed off.

783
01:23:33,773 --> 01:23:36,264
Have you used it?

784
01:23:42,448 --> 01:23:46,282
How wonderful it is.
- Have you seen that?

785
01:23:46,452 --> 01:23:48,613
No, I told you that
I've seen nothing.

786
01:23:49,188 --> 01:23:52,123
Then I'll take you there.
- How?

787
01:23:52,191 --> 01:23:54,523
One of my friends works there.
I'll tell him.

788
01:24:05,137 --> 01:24:09,233
I brought you here and see
how much you've got to spend.

789
01:24:09,308 --> 01:24:11,242
I'm not so poor.

790
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:14,074
Let me get a job and I'll
give you a better treat.

791
01:24:14,146 --> 01:24:16,239
Is it a job in Calcutta?

792
01:24:16,315 --> 01:24:22,413
One is in Calcutta and the
interview is on Tuesday.

793
01:24:22,488 --> 01:24:28,757
The other one is almost ready. I
can take it but I don't want to.

794
01:24:29,161 --> 01:24:31,686
Let us see how many
years we are in Calcutta.

795
01:24:31,764 --> 01:24:34,426
Is your father's job a transferable one?

796
01:24:35,167 --> 01:24:37,431
Yes, Income Tax.

797
01:24:37,503 --> 01:24:41,599
The one you addressed as aunty is she
your real aunty? - My mother's sister.

798
01:24:44,176 --> 01:24:48,442
She has nothing in
common with my mother.

799
01:24:48,514 --> 01:24:50,607
She doesn't appear like her sister at all.

800
01:24:52,184 --> 01:24:54,448
Your mother is not alive?

801
01:24:55,454 --> 01:24:58,446
No, she died when I was 7 years old.

802
01:25:02,628 --> 01:25:04,619
It would've been great
if you'd become a doctor.

803
01:25:05,464 --> 01:25:10,128
Will you study medicine?
- Me? Oh no!

804
01:25:11,136 --> 01:25:15,402
You have to cut and
dissect dead bodies.

805
01:25:16,141 --> 01:25:19,406
That has to be done, of course.
- Tell me why?

806
01:25:19,578 --> 01:25:25,244
You can know a lot. Like bones,
flesh, nerves, arteries.

807
01:25:25,317 --> 01:25:27,251
From any dead body?

808
01:25:27,319 --> 01:25:32,416
Because all of them are basically
the same unless it is abnormal.

809
01:25:37,263 --> 01:25:40,096
The gentleman sitting there...

810
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:43,100
...the one with the black suit.

811
01:25:44,503 --> 01:25:46,437
Are he and I basically the same?

812
01:25:50,442 --> 01:25:52,774
You are more or less the same but
there is a little difference...

813
01:25:52,844 --> 01:25:55,278
...in the fact that you're
a woman and he is a man.

814
01:26:00,118 --> 01:26:02,780
That woman, who is sitting
with her back to us. She?

815
01:26:03,955 --> 01:26:08,289
More or less the same but she
has something more than you.

816
01:26:08,793 --> 01:26:10,283
Fat!

817
01:26:15,133 --> 01:26:17,795
Even if it is the same there
is a lot of difference.

818
01:26:17,869 --> 01:26:19,928
They can't be the same.

819
01:26:21,139 --> 01:26:25,132
That can never be. The difference
in condition...

820
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:28,270
...and then there is education,
temperament...

821
01:26:28,346 --> 01:26:30,314
...then there is appearance too.

822
01:26:33,151 --> 01:26:35,142
How much difference there
is in the eyes themselves.

823
01:26:35,220 --> 01:26:37,188
You see some eyes and you feel
that he is a good person.

824
01:26:37,822 --> 01:26:39,813
Of course, but it does mean
that he is good since you...

825
01:26:39,891 --> 01:26:41,825
...feel that he seems
to be a good man.

826
01:26:41,893 --> 01:26:44,327
There could be a mistake.

827
01:26:50,101 --> 01:26:51,762
It is better that there
is no mistake.

828
01:28:27,799 --> 01:28:31,462
Tomorrow is the interview.
- I know.

829
01:28:33,138 --> 01:28:36,130
You will surely get this job.
- I hope so.

830
01:28:39,144 --> 01:28:41,476
If you don't get it, will
you go outside Calcutta?

831
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:44,312
I don't feel like it but...

832
01:28:47,252 --> 01:28:49,413
If you go away then I will
also not stay here.

833
01:28:54,092 --> 01:28:57,255
Where will you go?
- Delhi.

834
01:28:57,929 --> 01:29:01,421
I will stay there to do my studies.

835
01:29:02,934 --> 01:29:04,799
I'll stay in a friend's place.

836
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:08,432
And your father?
- He will stay here.

837
01:29:12,277 --> 01:29:14,268
He is getting married to the aunt.

838
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:26,780
Let's go.

839
01:29:45,977 --> 01:29:49,276
At times I think that
I should accept her

840
01:29:50,248 --> 01:29:55,242
Earlier I called her aunty. Now
I'll have to call her mama.

841
01:29:56,087 --> 01:30:00,251
But my grief for my mother
comes and stops me.

842
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:24,780
It is fortunate the fuse went off that day.

843
01:30:27,118 --> 01:30:32,112
Will you write letters? - You
write to me first. - Naturally.

844
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:33,782
If you write then I'll surely reply.

845
01:30:39,264 --> 01:30:42,791
Will you stop meeting me?
I may have to stay away...

846
01:30:42,867 --> 01:30:46,803
...for a long time. - Now I think
I'll keep meeting you. But...

847
01:31:15,099 --> 01:31:16,999
Mama, I'm leaving.
- Wait a moment, son.

848
01:31:19,103 --> 01:31:21,094
Why do you do these things?
You know it's no use.

849
01:31:21,172 --> 01:31:23,231
Brother.
- There is nothing wrong in it. Son.

850
01:31:23,308 --> 01:31:26,368
You will surely get the job.
Just like I got one.

851
01:31:26,444 --> 01:31:29,379
Do well and see to it that
you don't lose your temper.

852
01:31:47,232 --> 01:31:49,723
Siddartha Choudhury.

853
01:32:00,078 --> 01:32:02,069
Can I ask you something, brother?
- Tell me.

854
01:32:02,146 --> 01:32:05,411
Has the selection already been
made internally?

855
01:32:06,751 --> 01:32:08,343
What can I say about it?

856
01:32:08,419 --> 01:32:11,081
No I mean that... You tell
us what you know.

857
01:32:36,281 --> 01:32:43,778
What's your number?
- 71 - Three times is 213.

858
01:32:45,123 --> 01:32:46,784
It will be three hours from now
when your chance will come.

859
01:32:50,428 --> 01:32:53,056
In the beginning it will be for
5 minutes. Then it will keep...

860
01:32:53,131 --> 01:32:55,725
...decreasing to 1 or 1.5
minutes. That's how it is.

861
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,735
Brother, the vacancy is for
four and see how many people...

862
01:32:58,803 --> 01:33:01,203
...they have called for the interview.

863
01:33:01,272 --> 01:33:03,069
Chanchal Mukherjee.

864
01:33:30,935 --> 01:33:35,429
His job is here for sure.
- How tall is he?

865
01:33:37,108 --> 01:33:38,769
Say around 6 feet.

866
01:34:01,065 --> 01:34:04,296
I'm five feet six and he
is taller than me by 6 inches.

867
01:34:04,369 --> 01:34:07,736
Why do you worry? They might
prefer only shorter ones.

868
01:34:16,347 --> 01:34:23,082
What's the time?
- It's ten past ten.

869
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:38,762
Brother, listen. - Did you call me?
- Yes, what questions did they ask?

870
01:34:38,836 --> 01:34:43,773
It's the same. - If you tell us
then it might be useful to us.

871
01:34:43,841 --> 01:34:48,335
A little of history, a little
of geography and some politics.

872
01:34:48,413 --> 01:34:52,213
What were the questions?
- Where is Bonn?

873
01:34:52,283 --> 01:34:58,381
What did you say?
- The capital of Germany.

874
01:34:59,056 --> 01:35:01,718
Don't make so much noise. The
sir has said that if there...

875
01:35:01,793 --> 01:35:04,853
...is so much noise then the
interview shall be stopped.

876
01:35:07,131 --> 01:35:10,225
His master's voice.
- Yes, something like that.

877
01:35:10,301 --> 01:35:11,734
It's alright but very strange.

878
01:35:11,803 --> 01:35:15,204
Biphul Chatterjee.

879
01:36:00,117 --> 01:36:03,780
They should've made some
arrangement for sitting...

880
01:36:03,855 --> 01:36:07,791
...since there are so many people.
- That's true. Out of...

881
01:36:07,859 --> 01:36:10,794
...the two fans one is not working.
- Like this if we...

882
01:36:10,862 --> 01:36:14,457
...have to work for hour after
hour then we will be finished.

883
01:36:43,327 --> 01:36:45,158
Mihir Chakravorty.

884
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,281
What happened?
- What happened?

885
01:37:11,355 --> 01:37:12,788
Give him some fresh air.

886
01:37:12,857 --> 01:37:17,089
Get some water.
- Where is a glass?

887
01:37:19,130 --> 01:37:21,291
What happened? Has someone fainted?

888
01:37:21,365 --> 01:37:22,457
Yes, a person just now
fell down unconscious.

889
01:37:22,533 --> 01:37:24,797
Move. Let him lie down.

890
01:37:26,871 --> 01:37:28,805
Take him to that side.

891
01:37:39,984 --> 01:37:44,148
When I saw that person I
felt that he was sick.

892
01:37:46,157 --> 01:37:48,955
Shall I go and meet the bosses?
- What?

893
01:37:49,026 --> 01:37:50,755
They have called so many
people for an interview...

894
01:37:50,828 --> 01:37:52,762
...and they have the responsibility
to make some...

895
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:55,094
...seating arrangements for all of us.

896
01:37:55,166 --> 01:37:57,100
You can go and meet the bosses
but I don't think...

897
01:37:57,168 --> 01:38:00,103
...that it will be of any use.
- We are not doing anything illegal.

898
01:38:00,171 --> 01:38:02,765
We are only asking for a few chairs.

899
01:38:02,840 --> 01:38:05,104
Will anyone come with me?
- Should I? Okay come.

900
01:38:06,777 --> 01:38:10,110
Will you all come?
- Come, let's go.

901
01:38:20,124 --> 01:38:22,456
Where are you going without
permission? - It's an emergency.

902
01:38:28,132 --> 01:38:32,125
What's the matter? - If you could
provide some chairs...

903
01:38:32,203 --> 01:38:34,797
...outside. There is no place
to sit outside and half the...

904
01:38:34,872 --> 01:38:36,806
...people who have come are
standing from morning.

905
01:38:36,874 --> 01:38:40,469
If there is no place to sit
can't everyone adjust and sit?

906
01:38:40,544 --> 01:38:43,308
It is not possible to provide
75 chairs at the same time.

907
01:38:43,381 --> 01:38:45,315
The fact is that it is very hot
today and one of the two...

908
01:38:45,383 --> 01:38:47,044
...fans is also not working at all.
One person just fainted.

909
01:38:47,118 --> 01:38:50,747
If he fainted then he shouldn't
have applied with such a...

910
01:38:50,821 --> 01:38:53,153
...weak constitution.

911
01:38:53,924 --> 01:38:57,758
In this job he will have to
work much harder than this.

912
01:38:57,828 --> 01:38:59,762
Working hard on the job is
different but if in an interview...

913
01:38:59,830 --> 01:39:02,765
...you don't even get
a chair to sit in, then...

914
01:39:02,833 --> 01:39:05,199
What is your name? What
is your position?

915
01:39:06,270 --> 01:39:09,899
I didn't come to talk about me.
- Then go outside and wait.

916
01:39:09,974 --> 01:39:12,101
If there is no place to sit then
stand and wait. You come...

917
01:39:12,176 --> 01:39:14,110
...in only when your
name is called.

918
01:39:14,178 --> 01:39:17,443
The more problems you create
the more the delay. Go now.

919
01:39:19,116 --> 01:39:21,277
Why do you let all these
useless people come in?

920
01:39:21,352 --> 01:39:23,445
Sir, I told them not to.
They came in by force.

921
01:39:23,521 --> 01:39:26,115
Came in by force. Go outside
and stand guard.

922
01:39:45,142 --> 01:39:49,238
Do you want to sit? - You sit down
or else you might also faint.

923
01:39:55,086 --> 01:39:57,247
Soumitra Bannerjee.

924
01:40:57,081 --> 01:41:01,279
In many animals, as in all
vertebrae's, the general form...

925
01:41:01,352 --> 01:41:05,345
...of the body is maintained
by means of the skeleton.

926
01:41:09,927 --> 01:41:13,761
The skeleton consists of a series
of bones supplemented...

927
01:41:13,831 --> 01:41:18,359
...in certain regions by
pieces of cartilage.

928
01:41:19,436 --> 01:41:23,839
A striking characteristic
of bone is its hardness.

929
01:41:28,112 --> 01:41:32,139
The skeleton persists after death
for a variable length of...

930
01:41:32,216 --> 01:41:36,778
...time after the rest of the
body has disintegrated.

931
01:41:43,194 --> 01:41:45,788
Listen. The interviews will be
suspended for lunch for half...

932
01:41:45,863 --> 01:41:47,728
...an hour and after half an hour...

933
01:41:47,798 --> 01:41:50,028
...your names will be called once again.

934
01:42:01,912 --> 01:42:04,073
Where are you going?

935
01:42:04,782 --> 01:42:10,084
What do you think? - What's
the matter? - Are we animals?

936
01:42:10,154 --> 01:42:13,749
What's the matter? - Are we
servants or something like that?

937
01:42:13,824 --> 01:42:16,088
You get out.
- What right do you have...

938
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:19,095
...to behave like this with us.
- Chatterjee!

939
01:42:19,163 --> 01:42:20,994
I want an answer.

940
01:42:21,065 --> 01:42:22,259
Get out.

941
01:42:22,333 --> 01:42:23,994
Nonsense, what's this?

942
01:42:24,935 --> 01:42:27,096
Get out of here.

943
01:42:58,068 --> 01:43:00,059
I will, but before that...

944
01:43:00,137 --> 01:43:03,072
Today I had to leave behind a lot of
people whom I've known for a long time.

945
01:43:03,407 --> 01:43:08,071
But the most surprising thing is
that I remember you the most today.

946
01:43:08,145 --> 01:43:11,740
I've know you only for such a short time.

947
01:43:13,751 --> 01:43:17,414
The place Balurghat is more or
less the way I imagined it.

948
01:43:18,923 --> 01:43:24,327
For the time being I'm in a hotel.

949
01:43:26,096 --> 01:43:28,758
But when I say hotel it is not what
you normally would understand.

950
01:43:29,767 --> 01:43:32,759
Till I get a house I'll be staying here.

951
01:43:32,836 --> 01:43:35,771
When I shift to the house I will
send the address to you.

952
01:43:35,839 --> 01:43:38,273
I don't think that I'll be able
to stay here in comfort...

953
01:43:38,342 --> 01:43:39,775
...but this discomfort is nothing
compared to your discomfort.

954
01:43:39,843 --> 01:43:41,777
But whatever discomfort I have will
vanish when I get your letter.

955
01:43:42,112 --> 01:43:44,945
Today I'm very tired and
will not write much.

956
01:43:46,116 --> 01:43:54,387
I'll tell you about an incident
and end the letter.

957
01:43:55,225 --> 01:43:57,159
Can I get some tea?
- Yes.

958
01:44:46,877 --> 01:44:49,710
'The name of lord Ram
is the eternal truth.'

959
01:44:52,716 --> 01:44:54,707
'The name of lord Ram
is the eternal truth.'

960
01:44:54,785 --> 01:44:57,049
'The name of lord Ram
is the eternal truth.'

961
01:44:57,121 --> 01:44:59,214
'The name of lord Ram
is the eternal truth.'

962
01:44:59,289 --> 01:45:00,722
'The name of lord Ram
is the eternal truth.'

963
01:45:00,791 --> 01:45:02,725
'The name of lord Ram
is the eternal truth.'

964
01:45:02,793 --> 01:45:04,727
'The name of lord Ram
is the eternal truth.'

965
01:45:04,795 --> 01:45:06,729
'The name of lord Ram
is the eternal truth.'
