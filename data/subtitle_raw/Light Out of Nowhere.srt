Here's "Morning Calisthenics"
with Michael Ben-Hanan.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,960
I know exactly what you're doing
with those friends of yours.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,316
No one's going to tell me
what to do.

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,152
You can do whatever you want,
but I don't want you around here.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,950
Where are you coming
from at this hour?

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,076
Are you telling me what to do?
- Everybody knows what you're up to.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,160
Anywhere I go, I'm ashamed
to show my face.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,073
I'm not a mouse, like you.

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,830
When people see me,
they feel brave.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,830
Look at you. Pretty soon,
you'll start crying.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,873
I'd give anything to put an end
to you and your friends.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,558
Rikky, what's wrong?
- Mommy said you should come.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,829
So early? Okay. I'm coming
right away. -I'll come, too.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,638
It's on my way, anyway.

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,393
How's everything, Riki?

00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,239
Good morning.

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,873

23
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,118
So early in the morning?

24
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,192
Last night, I didn't feel well,

25
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,193
and I thought it would pass.
I didn't want to call the doctor.

26
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,039
But I couldn't sleep,
so I called for you.

27
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,349
I don't want you to get the doctor.
Just call and say it's Naomi Cohen.

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,960
He'll know what to do.
- Which doctor?

29
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,676
There's a note in the closet
with his phone number.

30
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,316
Did you come, too? I probably
woke up the entire house.

31
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,959
I can't find the note.

32
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,474
What's wrong? -Dizzy spells. It's
always like that in the morning.

33
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,310
Avram, since you're already here,
take Riki to school. -I'll do it.

34
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,514
Thank you, Shaul.
- Don't forget to get milk.

35
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,910
Say goodbye to Mommy.
- Goodbye.

36
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,115
Shaul, who is that?
- You don't know him.

37
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,636
I do know him. That's Hezkel,
Anat's brother. She's in my class.

38
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,509
Not Hezkel.
Yehezkel.

You'll never learn to fix cars
working like that.

43
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,234
You'll end up a cripple

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,320
Let me see.

45
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,671
Go put it under cold water.

46
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,236
Hurry up, Eli. The guys are waiting.
- Just a second. I'll change clothes.

47
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,194
What happened to you, Shaul?
- Nothing. I'm all right.

48
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,029
I know. It's hard at the beginning.
What else is new? -Everything's okay.

49
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,473
Where are you going?

50
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,232
What's going on, Eli?
- Just a minute!

51
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,359
Listen. Whatever money Eli gives you
keep for yourself.

52
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,156
Don't give a cent to Dad. If he
gets used to it, you're done for.

53
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,199
He's never asked.
- And don't take any crap from him.

54
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,914
Let me see.

55
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,354
It's nothing. Don't be a kid.
- You hate him so much?

56
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,389
I don't hate him,
but I don't love him, either.

57
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,679
You've only been in the neighborhood
for two weeks.

58
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,976
You haven't had a run in with him
yet. Just wait and see.

59
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,072
Let's go.
- Eli, when will you be home?

60
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,958
Rachel, not now.

61
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,474
Make any progress with Dalia?
- She's kind of shy.

62
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,390
They probably didn't teach you this
at boarding school,

63
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,313
but remember!
A woman doesn't call the shots.

64
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,233
The man does.

65
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,275
Shaul, keep working by yourself.

66
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,399
Tired, Shaul?

67
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,913
What have you been doing
at night?

68
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,073
Go buy me some cigarettes.

69
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,869
And tell Yosef to send over
something to eat.

70
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,956
I don't know what he wants from me.
Suddenly, he hit me.

71
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,879
I raised my hand? Believe me,
I have a street full of witnesses.

72
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,515
They saw him go into the car.
I parked it for one second.

73
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,680
Suddenly, he shows up.

74
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,513
Oh go to hell. Why would I hit
someone for no reason?

75
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,396
Believe me. You...
You deserve to get beaten up.

76
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,056
Did you hear that?
Did you hear how he threatened me?

77
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,515
Children, break it up. Break it up.
Break it up, everyone.

78
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,395
Move on, everyone. -Go away.

79
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,069
Hey, Shaul! How's it going?
- Avram, what's new?

80
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,073
Shaul, Shaul, Shaul.
The kids don't want help.

81
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,357
I got what I said I would.
A book. On ancient times.

82
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,156
I got it from an archeologist
who works at the port.

83
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,872
Did you also get me the keys?

84
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,600
Yes, of course. I'll get you
anything that you want.

85
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,994
What's going on, Shaul?
Are you still reading?

86
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,151
Aren't you sick of studying?

87
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,796
Where's Dad?
- He went to Auntie.

88
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,433
Why are you in such a rush?

89
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,551
Take this. -No, I don't need it.
- Just take it. It's not a lot.

90
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,596
Just remember. In life, either you
do the screwing, or you get screwed.

91
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,918
It'll take you a long time to learn
what a shitty life this is.

92
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,120
You're still green.

93

103
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,473
Yohanan, stop it. -You're not doing
us any favors, you know.

104
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,233
You can kiss my ass.
- Did you hear that?

105
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,954
Did you see that? -Your sister
is a whore. You and your unions.

Under the stone, by the window.

115
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,518
Here. Have a drink for good spirits.
- No. No.

116
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,953
You take it.

117
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,312
Whatever will be, will be.

118
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,237
Let's go. -Why should we go?
- This place scares me.

119
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,958
You're making yourself scared.

120
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,998
Finally, we're alone together,
in a room.

121
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,310
But you promised. You said so.

122
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,629
I'm scared. -Of me?

123
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,275
You don't have to be scared of me.
- I'm not scared of you. -So?

124
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,079
I don't know.

125
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,553
I'm just scared.

126
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,199
But now, I'm not anymore.

127
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,598
I'm sick of this! Let's go.

128
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,679
She's back, the slut.
Look at her.

129
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,475
Who are you hanging around with
at this hour of the night?

130
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,594
You don't care about work, anymore?
Just criminals?

131
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,475
Just cruising the streets,
along with the whores.

132
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,435
You'll become a whore
before you become a woman.

133
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,273
Why are you so quiet? Say something
to your daughter already!

134
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,313
Get in the house.
- "Get in the house."

135
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,151
Get in already.

136
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,279
All night, all day.
Not a moment of peace.

137
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,838
Where were you all day?

138
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,470
Did you eat anything?
- I'm not hungry.

139
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,390
Want some tea? -No.

140
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,312
What's the matter with you? Did
you fight with Dalia again, as usual?

141
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,398
I didn't fight with her
or anything.

142
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,112
I spoke with her mother. She
doesn't want you coming home late.

143
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,355
What does her mother want?
What has Dalia been doing, anyway?

144
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,353
Have you seen Baruch?
- What do you want from him?

145
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,833
He's been living here this whole
time and I'm not complaining.

146
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,555
But he just comes in, looks for food
and drink. Thinks only of himself.

147
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,351
We don't owe him anything. He never
asks how his auntie is feeling.

148
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,198
What's new at home? This house could
burn down and he'd... -How's Auntie?

149
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,078
We have enough to worry about.
Uncle Shlomi will return on Saturday.

150
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,398
Let him worry about it.

151
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,034
But if you could pop over there
tomorrow and help her out a bit.

152
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,278
Go to the market,
and stuff like that.

153
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,398
I'd go myself, but we're being
transferred to Ashkelon tomorrow.

154
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,037
Good night. -Good night.

155
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,755
Shaul!

156
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,476
Come on in. -Where?

157
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,109
You made a deal.
Come see how we live it up.

158
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,036
Is this your brother?
- Uh huh. -The scholar.

159
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,154
He's working for Eli?
- Yes. -What a man, that Eli.

160
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:14,199
Making any money? -You can make more
money if you don't work.

161
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,352
Not everyone is tired like you.
- Guys, cut the crap.

162
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,313
You'll scare him away.

163
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,353
Have you ever been
in a night club?

164
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,509
"Mina, tell me
why you are so angry again?

165
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,550
"What bad thing has he done
to you again today?

166
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,790
"What is all the fuss about?

167
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,273
"What can't you just live in peace,
tell me? Why?

168
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,033
"You're pretty at night.

169
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,760
"You're smart at night..."

170
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,676
Look. Do you see them?

171
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,755
If I wanted to, I could snap
my fingers and have them all.

172
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,793
You smile at them, you laugh
with them, you drink with them.

173
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,232
But they think you're nothing.
Steer clear of them, eh?

174
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,951
If they only could,
they'd kill you.

175
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,234
In life, it matters who's doing what
with whom and how.

176
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,160
Once, you know,
in Little Tel Aviv, when guys

177
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,715
used to meet, they'd say,
"Hello. How are you?"

178
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,798
They'd part with "Goodbye." Today,
it's "How's the health, Moishe?"

179
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,758
"How's the health, Haim?"
"Feel good."

180
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,952
"Feel good." Everyone's always
talking about their health.

181
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,640
Oh, sorry. That was in Yiddish.
I'll translate into Hebrew soon.

182
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,831
The same thing. Be well.
For example...

183
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,754
They're not worth your spit.

184
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,559
Ukshenstein goes into a coffee shop
and one guy says to the other,

185
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,957
"See that Ukshenstein?
He embezzled half a million liras."

186
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,151
The guy say, "Whaddya say!
Good for him!"

187
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,430
A gal goes into the same coffee shop
and he tells him,

188
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,473
"See that gal? In one night,
she makes 200 liras!"

189
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,712
"Whaddya say?
Good for her!"

190
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,473
No hello?
- Oh, it's you. How are you?

191
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,800
Who's that good looking guy?
- Another one. -I don't believe it.

192
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,389
Aren't you bringing something
to drink? -Anything, for you.

193
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,030
Are you angry? -I'm thirsty.

194
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,436
Did you see that? It's a long story.
- Pretty.

195
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,517
Just look at him.
He actually loves European Jews.

196
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,113
They should all be killed while
they are still small, those types.

197
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:05,235
Excuse me. Where is the hotel
called "Ramat Aviv?"

198
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,553
Yeah, up yours, Ramat Aviv.
- Thank you. What did he say?

199
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,832
What? What?

200
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,590
I... My head... Go. Go.
- Hey, where've you been?

201
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,955
Hello, Shaul.

202
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,336
Shaul, wait. Can you come
for Kaddish, the mourner's prayer?

203
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,416
We need ten men for services,
remember? In memory of my mother.

204
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,273
I'm really in a rush. -Come on!
I've been waiting for along time.

205
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,230
It'll just take a few minutes.
Have some tea. It won't take long.

206
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,239
Really, it won't. Hey,
it's a good deed. There's also...

207
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,549
There are also cookies.

208
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,552
"Peace to all of Israel.”

209
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,630
Who is he? -Sheetrit.
- What? -Sheetrit.

210
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,951
Sheetrit? Oh, fine. Can he read?
- Yes.

211
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:15,317
Good. Let's start with the Kaddish.
You can answer "Amen," right?

212
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,479
Fine. -Stand up. -Stand up.
Stand up. -With respect.

213
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,116
"Glorified and sanctified
be God's name." -Amen!

214
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,676
"Throughout the world which He has
created according to his will..."

215
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,878
"And may he bring the Messiah."
- Amen.

216
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,789
"May He establish his kingdom in your
lifetime... and say Amen." -Amen.

217
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,556
It's good you got here now.
Have some tea with me.

218
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,794
No, I'm not thirsty. I just
had a drink. -You are so bashful.

219
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,716
You don't have to be shy with me.
Wait. I'll go get some.

220
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,592
Dad asked how you're doing.
He couldn't come this morning.

221
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,310
They went to Ashkelon.
- Yes. What a job he has.

222
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,873
How are you feeling this morning?
- Better.

223
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,590
What do you have?
- It's a woman's thing.

224
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,955
Nothing important. It will pass.
- Yesterday, Dad and I...

225
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,075
I told your Dad not to take you out
of that boarding school. I told him.

226
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,315
Shlomo would have paid,
but your father was stubborn.

227
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,360
Once he gets something in his head,
nothing will make him budge.

228
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,476
I'm not sorry I came back.
At least now, he doesn't yell at me.

229
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,430
He's not so nervous. Every time I'd
come home, he'd yell all the time.

230
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,839
Would you like some of my toast?

231
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,592
Dad always picked fights with me.
Any excuse to start yelling.

232
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,993
"Do this!" "Go there."
Now, he yells at Baruch.

233
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,216
When you see Baruch, tell him
that Naomi is angry at him.

234
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,799
Can't he stop by to see
how I'm doing?

235
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,238
He comes home late every night
and sleeps all day long.

236
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,039
When I left, he still
hadn't come back.

237
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,153
Dad said you might need something.
- What? No, no. Nothing.

238
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,830
No, no. Not here. From the store.
Groceries and stuff.

239
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,118
Well, if you want to,
then bring me...

240
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,918
bread and milk and a dozen eggs.
Put it on my bill.

241
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,874
I forgot to ask. What about work?
Did you leave in the middle?

242
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,116
It's okay. Eli knows it's for you.

243
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,789
Look. Do you see? Scandinavia.

244
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,075
Baruch said,
"Go tell Shaul. Quick!"

245
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,231
"Tell him that today..."
- What do you mean?

246
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,394
For you, too.
Nice, like that. Take it easy.

247
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,559
All white, the snow.
Scandinavia.

248
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,551
You never speak clearly.
Where is Baruch? -Scandinavia.

249
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:26,596
There. Pretty. What's wrong?
You're not a kid anymore.

250
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,953
Come on.
- Wait till they go away.

251
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,989
Come on.

252
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,159
I'm going.

253
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,679
I waited for you.
- Was Shimon here? -Yes.

254
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,190
Well, he brought a Swedish chick
over here yesterday.

255
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,039
Who knows were he found her.
- I saw her.

256
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,029
She was here with your friends.
- Come on. Let's go in.

257
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,679
Her name is Bracha.

258
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,955
Shimon just gets me in trouble.
- He said that you brought her.

259
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,471
Liar! He doesn't know
what he's doing. Let's go in.

260
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,152
Bracha, put more fun in it.

261
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,955
Whoah! That Scandinavian.
What a body, eh?

262
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,358
Did you at least sleep with her?

263
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,832
You're pretty smart,
she's a dirty thing.

264
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,873
Who hasn't laid her? Practically
the whole neighborhood's had her.

265
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,073
Have you seen the guys?
Was Hanani here? -Yes.

266
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,839
They're scared of me.
They want the bail money.

267
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,793
Do you know why I called you?
You're the only one who can help me.

268
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,715
Look. I never asked you
to do anything for me.

269
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,796
Remember? When you came home
for vacation, who gave you money?

270
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,911
Dad or me? -Cut it out!
Tell me what's going on.

271
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,634
You know they got me out
by using their money.

272
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,030
They're your friends.
- Not everything you see is true.

273
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,073
You're still a kid, Shaul.
You don't know what friends are.

274
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,390
See, I kind of took a loan
from them. 700 liras.

275
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,119
I had some of my own money,
but now, I'm burned out.

276
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,754
See that one?
Don't think that I like it.

277
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,351
Whore money is dirty money.
But it's temporary.

278
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,840
Besides, she brings in close to
nothing. I really need cash now!

279
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,310
Where would I get cash?
- Hear me out.

280
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,991
I need is a small loan. That's all.
Not from you. From Dad. -Dad?

281
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,119
It's not what you think. Dad is
loaded. All that crying and praying?

282
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,394
It's one big lie.
- Even so. He won't give it to you.

283
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,920
Not to me, but he'll give it to you.
You're the one he loves.

284
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,997
Are you crazy? 700 liras?

285
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,558
So let him give you only 500.
Don't you get it?

286
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,792
Do you want me to beg you?

287
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,192
Do you remember
what happened to Eli?

288
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,917
Do you think they did that
just because of me?

289
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,197
They were afraid someone
would rat on them, too.

290
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,909
Hanani and I have had
a few complications.

291
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,191
Man, if I wasn't burned out right
now, you'd see what would happen.

292
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,920
He won't give me the money.
- Aren't you going out with Dalia?

293
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,600
Yes. -So tell Dad
that you got her pregnant.

294
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,229
No, I won't. -Stop pitying Dad.

295
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,676
It's time you learned what kind
of person he really is.

296
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,632
He won't flinch at 500. I promise.
He's such a cheapskate.

297
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,276
Even 1000 is nothing for him.
You don't believe he ratted on me?

298
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,269
I don't know. -It's the truth.
As sure as I'm your brother.

299
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,911
He'll give you as much
as you want for an abortion.

300
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,794
And if he doesn't?
- Convince him. Shed some tears.

301
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,432
He'll kill me. -Don't worry.
He's down on himself because of me.

302
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,359
I know him really well.

303
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,674
Look, Shaul.
I don't like to have to ask twice.

304
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,392
'I be gone by tomorrow or so.
I just have to finish things up.

305
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,638
Pay off the money and that's it.
I'd do it without you if I could.

306
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,359
You wouldn't hear a peep out of me.

307
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,679
Throw it here! Here!

308
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,235
Catch!

309
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,239
Come on. Catch. Catch it.

310
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,397
Hey, Shaul. How's it going?
- Throw it here!

311
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,034
Come and play.
- Here! Here!

312
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,559
Hey, why are you quitting? -Give me
the ball and we'll keep going.

313
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,035
What else?

314
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,438
Go get it.
- Shaul, go get the ball.

315
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,358
What are you looking at?
Go get it.

316
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,193
Shaul, can't you hear? My ball.
Go bring it back.

317
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,075
Keep sleeping, you sucker. -Fuck you,
sucker. -Your sister's lame.

318
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,311
Shaul, I'm warning you.
Go bring the ball back.

319
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,239
Man, Haim. When his brother gets
back from jail you're gonna get beat.

320
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,478
Oh, you're scaring me.
Where is Baruch in all this?

321
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,591
Now you're in for it, Haim.

322
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,360
Man, Shaul. You are in luck.
Today, Haim is really uptight.

323
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,319
I threw it to you. Why didn't you
catch it? -That's enough.

324
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,954
Stop fighting. You're something else.
You're gonna get beat up.

325
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,357
You're going to punch out a chicken?
- Leave him alone.

326
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,356
Leave him alone.
- Break them up. -Watch out.

327
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,236
Yehiel, come home. Now!

328
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,831
Yehiel, look at yourself.

329
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,997
20 liras for a yard of cloth at
"Beit Romano.” -It's not the same.

330
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,117
What's not the same?
What are you talking about?

331
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,309
Come with me and see.
- The Arabs. Exactly.

332
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,791
We depend on ourselves too much.
- Listen. I work there.

333
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,078
I know them.
They will never be human beings.

334
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,592
Do you understand? They are all
tails. They don't have a head.

335
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,555
You think we're better than them?
- Shlomo, how can you compare?

336
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,120
Well, it seems to me
that you really love them.

337
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,592
I didn't say "love," but why
don't they integrate?

338
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,755
For the life of me, I can't
understand you. I don't get it.

339
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,036
What will happen to you now?
- I'll get a job.

340
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,240
Did you ask how Eli is doing?
- A little rice in the soup.

341
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,993
My husband's a jerk. The same food
for 20 years. -You're lucky.

342
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,316
Integration?
Where do you want them to integrate?

343
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,799
How should I know? In the paper,
on TV, in the municipalities.

344
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,950
In the worker's union. There are
lots of possibilities.

345
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,950
Oh, come on, Zechariah. -You didn't
ask about him at home, did you? -No.

346
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,438
Tomorrow morning, go
to the "Working Youth."

347
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,676
Go early. Be there at eight. Tell
them the situation at home is bad.

348
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,191
You left the boarding school.
Are you listening or not?

349
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,992
How should I talk to you?
- I heard "Working Youth."

350
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,830
I'll go there tomorrow morning.
- Make a list. Parsley...

351
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,955
I wrote it down. -Parsley.
- I wrote it down.

352
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,754
So what will be?
- Definitely not the end.

353
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,992
You said there's not enough money.
- Money. Not just money.

354
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,596
They say there's not enough
just to try and blackmail you.

355
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,634
I don't understand how
people like you talk like that.

356
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,839
Come on. You communist.

357
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,077
Name? -Shaul.
Last name? -Sheetrit.

358
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,396
Age? -17. -Land of emigration?
- I was born in Israel.

359
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,954
Education? -Till tenth grade.
- Ten years.

360
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,193
What would you like to do, son?

361
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:53,116
Whatever there is. -Physical work
wouldn't suit a boy like you.

362
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,630
Would you like to be a clerk
at the insurance office?

363
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,918
Okay, I guess.

364
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,793
I'll send you over.

365
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,672
How much do they pay?
- What they always pay.

366
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,153
And if they don't accept me?

367
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,476
If I send you, they'll accept you.

368
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,553
No, I mean...
What if I don't like it?

369
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,030
Can I come back here
and you'll give me something else?

370
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,591
We'll see. Don't be picky.

371
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,560
Where are you going?
- To the bathroom. -Go to your right.

372
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,070
I'm sorry, Shaul.
But it just isn't working.

373
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,158
My parents are being really strict.

374
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,958
Dalia.
- I'm not in the mood. I don't know.

375
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,790
Don't think
that I don't have feelings for you.

376
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,271
You're the only one
I can tell everything.

377
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,873
You barely say anything.
- You neither.

378
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,076
Yesterday, my dad took away
everything I'd earned. 700 liras.

379
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,111
If I'd had more, he'd have taken it.
I'm so sick of them.

380
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,109
Every time I go home...

381
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,916
A long time ago,
I signed up at a kibbutz.

382
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,193
They just notified me
that I was accepted.

383
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:18,280
You're not mad, right?
- No way. -I don't think I'll go.

384
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,400
What would I do there?
- I think it would be best for you.

385
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,395
I don't know.
Now, it seems so far away.

386
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,833
So what will you do?
You have to do something.

387
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,191
I have relatives in Italy.
My dad said I could go there.

388
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,079
Where will you get the money?
- I'll save up.

389
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,551
Dalia, I think the faster
you get out of the neighborhood,

390
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,309
the better it will be for you.
- Where would I go?

391
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,958
I don't know.
There has to be somewhere.

392
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,114
Some place. I can see
what they do to you at home.

393
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,349
You are so sweet,
the way you talk to me.

394
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,469
Anything he asks, you answer.
He knows a lot of people.

395
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,074
Let's see how you look.

396
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,833
Come in. Come in.
How are you, Mr. Sheetrit?

397
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,479
So this is your son? Make yourselves
comfortable. Have a seat.

398
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,553
Can you believe this is your dad?
Well, what can you do?

399
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,834
How old is he?
- He's already 17.

400
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,798
A young man. What does he know?
- He's been at a boarding school.

401
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,078
Agriculture, right? Oh yes.
Now I remember. You told me.

402
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,478
Do you know any English?

403
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,836
Read a paragraph from
the "Jerusalem Post."

404
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,992
I don't know how to read.
- You don't know?

405
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,798
Didn't you learn over there?

406
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,679
He's shy.

407
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,914
That's okay. That's okay.
It might be hard, but we'll manage.

408
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,032
How long till the army? -A year
or so. -That's not a lot of time.

409
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,709
Are you physically able to work?
- Yes, why not?

410
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,710
He went to the "Working Youth"
but he didn't get a job.

411
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,239
He probably was scared to open his
mouth. He says yes to everything.

412
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,839
I understand.

413
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,074
I think he gave the impression
of a lazy kid, no?

414
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,630
Would you take a physical job?
An insurance company? -No.

415
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,910
I already was at an insurance
company. I'll find something else.

416
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,192
Shaul! -What's wrong with that?
Here, look at me.

417
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,155
Ask your father.
I worked at all sorts of jobs.

418
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,030
I ran, I sweat, I patted men
on the backs.

419
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:13,560
I had to have so much patience,
strength, intelligence. You name it.

420
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,594
What didn't I do?
- Yes. Yes.

421
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,512
Are you interested in advertising?

422
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,950
Really, that's clean work.
- What would he do there?

423
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,397
He doesn't know anything.
- He'll start as a messenger boy.

424
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,712
Then, he'll learn, like everyone
does. But no pampering.

425
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,394
How much do they pay?

426
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,478
That's not bad for a start.

427
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,196
What do you say, Shaul?

428
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,876
I'm telling you. He's shy.
- I'm not shy.

429
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,395
A person like you
and an office like this...

430
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,995
Come to me tomorrow at the office
and learn something, okay, Shaul?

431
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,359
Your father and I are old friends.
If I don't help you, who will?

432
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,679
Come alone and we'll find something,
I promise you.

433
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,156
Hello, Sarikeh. Do you have
a couple of seconds for me?

434
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,433
I just love you, Sarikeh!
- Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

435
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,432
Leave me alone, you idiot.

436
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,275
Hey, Sarikeh.
Welcome to the club.

437
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,834
If I don't take care of myself...

438
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,311
You're bad, this time, Yehezkel.

439
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,393
Well, I have a crazy idea.

440
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,216
Come here, Yohanan.
See that tree over there?

441
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,197
Go hang yourself on it.
- Wait, listen to my idea.

442
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,640
You'll die laughing.
- Let her rip.

443
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,559
Imagine there's only one bathroom
in the whole country.

444
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,117
Imagine, everyone's waiting in line.
Golda, Abba Eban, Yehezkel...

445
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,953
Oh cut the crap already.
- What's wrong? Can't you hold it in?

446
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,793
Just hear me out. What's happens?

447
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,355
Everyone who finishes runs
to the back of the line again.

448
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,118
But the main thing is, wait.
How does it go?

449
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,958
Wait, wait a second.

450
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,359
So what do they do? They all go
back to the end of the line, yeah.

451
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,558
To make it short, the entire country
comes to a standstill.

452
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,950
Listen, listen...
the whole country's become paralyzed.

453
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,431
What does one guy do?
He organizes an underground.

454
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,157
He digs, and digs, and digs.
Starts a black market. -Moron.

455
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,719
Tell me, Yohanan. Did you have
these ideas during the austerity?

456
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,440
About what? Toilets? Hey,
you gave me a good idea.

457
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,591
Look! Here comes
an American car.

458
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,830
Did they release you, Baruch?
- Come on. Get in, Shaul.

459
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,874
Hurry up.

460
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,799
Kushi, turn on the radio.
- Sit down and breathe the air.

461
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,994
Come on, Shaul. You little boy.
Make some food. Baruch. Baruch...

462
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,554
What's going on?
- Nothing. That's all we need.

463
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,229
No one is going to act up. They know
they'd better not open their mouths.

464
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,278
Are you staying here, meanwhile,
or coming home? -Staying here.

465
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,350
You've become mice, both of you.
- Keep your eye on me.

466
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,679
He went crazy. Cracked a bottle on
my head. -Didn't we bet? -Fuck off.

467
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,435
Want one? -No, not now.

468
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,356
Why did you bring your brother?
- Family trouble.

469
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,755
Baruch... you're out on bail.

470
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:44,917
Food, food. food. Bon appetite!
Baruch, Baruch. Eat.

471
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,875
Leave him alone. What's wrong with
you? Nerves eating you up?

472
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,830
You forgot how they caught you.
- Go away and comeback tonight.

473
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,554
Fuck off. Calm down.
- You've changed.

474
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,319
Leave my problems to me.
Come, Shaul. Sit down.

475
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,875
Shaul, eat something. Don't you
like the food? It's sardines.

476
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,278
Hanani, forget about everything
for now. Come and eat something.

477
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,873
So Shaul, what's new with you?

478
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,993
And Dad? Auntie? Rikki? -Auntie's
really sick. No one knows why.

479
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,713
Is she suffering?
- Doctors come by, nonstop.

480
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,759
Poor woman.

481
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,719
So you're not working?

482
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,398
That's okay. You can rely on me.
- No. It's all right.

483
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,917
Dad knows someone who promised
to get me a job. -Dad.

484
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,112
Watch out for him. -Why? -Hanani,
I want you to stay till the end.

485
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,118
Listen and listen good.

486
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,111
Remember the fight
we had that morning?

487
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,155
Our old man went to the police
and talked about me.

488
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,479
Ask me how I know?

489
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,919
Someone else was going down until
I realized. He's pretty smart.

490
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,719
He went to one of his friends
who just happens to be a cop.

491
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,070
They thought they'd get some
information out of me. Suckers.

492
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:39,038
I'll settle the account with him
myself, but I wanted you to know

493
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,635
while you're here, with these
witnesses, I'm telling you what

494
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,236
happened so you and everyone else
get the story straight.

495
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,271
I swear that everything
I told you was the truth.

496
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,957
What long faces!
Aren't you guys having a party?

497
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,316
Leave him alone.
How are you, Shaul?

498
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,669
Fine. How are you?
- Are you still working for Eli?

499
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,151
Yes, why? -Just because.
Your dad probably doesn't know yet.

500
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:19,075
What? -Didn't Eli tell you? Baruch?
- Baruch what?

501
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,800
Are you pretending, or what?
They caught him here this morning.

502
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,317
The entire neighborhood
was up and running.

503
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:28,312
Didn't you know?
Wait! Shaul, wait!

504
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,713
Shaul?

505
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,918
The police arrested Baruch.

506
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,116
I'm not surprised
after what I heard about him.

507
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,717
When did they arrest him?
- I have to see Eli. They're friends.

508
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,839
He probably knows. -Where are you
running? What can you do?

509
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,596
I'll put the milk in the fridge.

510
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,156
Who told you he got arrested?

511
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,799
Now, Roni.
The whole neighborhood knows.

512
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,950
I don't envy your father.

513
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,355
Oh, it's you?
It took you long enough.

514
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,030
They arrested my brother.
- Know. What can you do?

515
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,669
You know?
How do you know?

516
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,679
Are you interrogating me?
Get back to work. Fast.

517
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,397
Did they arrest anyone else?
- Meanwhile, no one else.

518
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,474
Baruch won't talk.
- Only Baruch?

519
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,077
What's going on?
Are you taking a day off?

520
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,075
I have to find out
before my father gets home.

521
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,675
You're not moving from here
until the work gets done. Get it?

522
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,674
I'm sick of you!

523
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,750
If you want, then after work,
go to Yosef's coffee shop.

524
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,430
They know exactly
what's going on over there.

525
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,549
If not for your brother,
you'd never get to work here.

526
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,111
You're worse than a woman.

527
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,400
Hi, Eli.
- Hi, Moshiko. Hi.

528
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,354
Hello?

529
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,360
What?

530
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,272
The quieter, the better.

531
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,598
Talk less, okay?

532
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:31,071
Getting arrested is nothing.
They'll let him go for lack of proof.

533
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,274
You'll see. Tomorrow he'll be back.
King of the neighborhood.

534
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,936
And if I don't return it to you,
what will you do?

535
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:37,640
So I'll sit in jail.
How bad could that be?

536
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,318
Really? What could happen?

537
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,000
Are you going already?
Wait. Wait a minute.

538
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:50,670
We haven't seen you for years.
- I'm going. -Shaul, have a coffee.

539
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,759
You have one, too.

540
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,190
What's new? We never see you around.
- What can I say.

541
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,072
My head is killing me
after yesterday.

542
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,510
Yesterday, all the guys
were sitting at the Arianna.

543
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,592
I'm not exaggerating.
I drank three...

544
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:08,591
What's wrong with him? -Poor guy.
His brother got busted for drugs.

545
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,238
He left his wife for a Moroccan.
- Who left his wife?

546
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,831
Tziyon. -Who's Tziyon?

547
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,069
What are you doing here?

548
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,436
Do you want your father to come
and see you? Go!

549
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,513
Have you heard anything from Baruch?
- Since when do you care about him?

550
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:30,154
He'll get out by tomorrow. That's
how it works at the police.

551
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,714
Don't his friends know anything?
- I told you. He'll get out tomorrow.

552
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,357
Why only Baruch?
What about them?

553
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,792
Yosef, you shit head. What kind
of coffee is this? -I'm coming.

554
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,559
It's a waste of your time.

555
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:57,038
Shaul, Shaul, Shaul!

556
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,590
Oh, poor Baruch.

557
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,236
Take another book. It's interesting.
The cops. Those dogs.

558
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,476
Now where to? -To Jaffa.
- Are you running away?

559
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,678
No, I'm going to get my dad.

560
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,313
Dad!

561
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,639
They arrested Baruch.
What should I do?

562
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,438
You're asking me what to do?

563
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,991
You go today. He'll go tomorrow.
There is a lot of work to finish.

564
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,719
There is a lot of work.

565
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,679
You go.
I'll be right there.

566
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,950
I don't understand. Why is she so
stubborn? -Because of the girl.

567
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:54,712
Mr. Cohen? -He's working in the
field. It's not easy to get him out.

568
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,717
If the situation gets worse, take
her to the hospital right away.

569
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,958
What's the difference?
We know.

570
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,434
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheetrit. Goodbye.

571
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,952
Would you like a drink? -Sit down.
I'll make tea. -No. No need.

572
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,995
At least some tea and toast.
She hasn't eaten all day.

573
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,199
Rikki, dear, it's late. Go to sleep.
- I don't want to.

574
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,496
Shaul, take her to her room
and wait till she falls asleep.

575
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,309
I don't want to. I'm not tired.
See what I drew in school today?

576
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,597
Shaul, look!

577
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,197
The tea is almost ready.

578
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,556
I won't drink.
- Go, Avram. No need for you to stay.

579
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:57,315
It's not the first attack.
Shaul is probably hungry.

580
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,112
Have you eaten, Shaul?
- It's okay. -I'll stop by tomorrow.

581
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:06,713
And don't berate yourself because
of Baruch. There are lots like him.

582
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,197
They say there was an informer.

583
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,676
I don't like what the doctor said.

584
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,477
I don't understand your problem
with Baruch. He's all trouble.

585
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,951
Let him sit in jail. See what it is.
Maybe make him a human being.

586
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:25,035
Wait and see. They'll let him out
tomorrow. -It doesn't go so fast.

587
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,550
Why do you want him
to stay there so badly?

588
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,949
Eli, what happened to you?

589
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,996
They're all bastards.

590
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,072
Go call Rachel, quick! -Okay.

591
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,800
Rachel!

592
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,315
Rachel! -What?

593
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,076
Did something happen to Naomi? -No.

594
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,670
Well, talk! Cat got your tongue?

595
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,911
Eli wants you.
- What does he want?

596
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,554
He got hurt. -Hurt?

597
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,479
Hurt.

598
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,674
Hurt.

599
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,799
It's not serious.

600
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,594
A little wounded in the face.

601
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,554
Where have you been all day?
We haven't seen you.

602
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,434
I was at a movie.

603
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:54,797
See? Sasson is building
another room. -So let him.

604
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,990
What's with you? You're not working
and won't look for work?

605
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,518
I'm looking.
- Were you at Ezra's again? -No.

606
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,478
Of course! You enjoy not working.

607
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,074
Just sitting around all day
with those thugs at the coffee shop.

608
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:16,080
Playing cards. -I don't sit with
thugs and I don't play cards.

609
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,992
So where have you been all day?

610
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,718
And now movies? From the street
to the movies. Movie to street.

611
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,711
You weren't with me at the movies.
I went with Dalia.

612
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,636
Didn't I tell you I don't want
trouble? Did someone see you?

613
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,190
No one saw us.
We each went home alone.

614
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,755
How long's it been since you visited
your aunt? -I went there yesterday.

615
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,677
I want to tell you something.
- What?

616
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,233
Did something happen?
- No, nothing.

617
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,077
It's about Dalia.
- Dalia? Again?

618
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,195
What again?
What already happened?

619
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,640
What happened?

620
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,192
Are you going to talk clearly,
or not?

621
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,594
You don't let me speak.
- I don't let him speak.

622
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,936
You've been talking for two hours
and you haven't said anything yet.

623
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,439
What's eating you?

624
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,319
Dalia and I... I...

625
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,154
I got her pregnant.

626
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:22,953
Pregnant? Pregnant?
How pregnant did you get her?

627
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,871
No, not really pregnant.
- You're worse than your brother.

628
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:31,039
What have you done?
When did this happen?

629
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,635
A week ago.
- A week ago?

630
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,436
And how do you know
that you got her pregnant?

631
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,833
I told you, it's not for sure.
But I think she's...

632
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,353
I don't know.
- Sit down. Finish eating.

633
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,717
What did you tell me all this for?
Pregnant, not pregnant?

634
00:57:55,320 --> 00:58:00,076
If she's really pregnant, I'm scared
her parents will raise hell.

635
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:05,076
Is it dangerous, or not?
- Well, if she needs an abortion...

636
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,514
Where would I get the money?

637
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,917
You need money? Did you lose
a card game? -I told you.

638
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:15,357
I don't play cards.
- So what do you need money for?

639
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:20,077
I go out and have fun, don't I?
I'll give it back when I can.

640
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,599
How much do you need?

641
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,753
How much can you give?

642
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,879
Pay it back when you can.
I'm not telling you

643
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,190
to get a job just for the money.

644
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:48,512
A guy without a job
doesn't finish anything.

645
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,639
You got in big trouble.

646
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,709
My heart tells me so,
from the minute you stepped in here.

647
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,559
If you don't tell me what happened,
there will be hell to pay.

648
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,590
I'm not in trouble. -You're not in
trouble, but 50 isn't enough.

649
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:15,912
How much do you need? -A couple
hundred. -I have no patience for you.

650
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:28,594
Baruch's in trouble. I want to help.
- Baruch? You're with Baruch?

651
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,551
What do you
have to do with Baruch?

652
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,160
Have you connected up with him?
What are you doing with Baruch?

653
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,710
I'm not connected up with him,
but he's in trouble.

654
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,110
Even though you fought with him,
you have to help him.

655
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,989
When did he get out?
- Yesterday.

656
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:53,393
What's the matter?
- It's the bail. He owes his friends.

657
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,471
And he sent you. He won't get
a dime from me. -Why not.

658
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,229
Just no. We're done here.
- We're not done.

659
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,358
I saw him.
I know exactly what he has.

660
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,479
Do you remember what they did to Eli
when they thought ratted on them?

661
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,355
Now Baruch is scared, too. Hanani
and others won't work with him.

662
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,313
He's alone in Shimon's shack.
- Don't care.

663
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,351
Clean the table.
- I won't clean it.

664
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,713
What's with you?

665
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,838
First, your brother. Now, you.
Why are you ganging up on me?

666
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,910
What do you want from me?
To kill me?

667
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,152
Go ahead. Just kill me.

668
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,439
I know you have money.
I always knew but I believed you.

669
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,839
You stopped my studies.
You said you can't work anymore.

670
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:46,877
"I don't have enough money."
Then, you sent Baruch to jail.

671
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,073
You ratted on him.

672
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,871
At first, I didn't believe it.
But now, I think I do.

673
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:02,910
Shaul, what kind of things
did Baruch put in your head?

674
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,476
Look at me.
What did you just say?

675
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,153
What did you say? That I...

676
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:14,596
I got him sent to jail?
Is that what he said?

677
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,878
And you believe him?

678
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:21,196
Where is he right now?
- In Shimon's shack.

679
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,556
See him and tell him
"Dad wants to talk to you."

680
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:27,953
Let him come here and tell me
everything he told you.

681
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,711
Just go and get Baruch.

682
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,437
What's the matter? -Go get him.
Tell him his brother's waiting.

683
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:51,798
Hi. That was fast.

684
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,354
Hey, what's going on with you?
- I'll show you.

685
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,798
Dad ratted on you, did he?
- Shaul.

686
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,711
He'll kill him.
- Get inside already.

687
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,957
This isn't for females.
You're old. Get inside.

688
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:09,957
They're brothers.
They'll work it out.

689
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,831
Enough, Shaul. Enough.

690
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,679
Stop it, Shaul!

691
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:22,558
Shaul, that's enough!

692
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,798
Shaul, that's enough!

693
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,599
Fuck you!

694
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,470
Go and ruin the houses
of the European Jews.

695
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,910
Where were you all those years
we had it bad?

696
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:32,472
Where should I have left my kids?
Out on the streets? Like monkeys?

697
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,273
That's what the government wants.

698
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,031
It's okay for our kids to fight
the Arabs for you.

699
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,794
But find them a place
to live tomorrow? No way!

700
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,874
Is that what the government wants?
Leave me alone.

701
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:49,671
Right. Bring in those pale skinned
Russians to investigate. Sure.

702
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,354
All those years when we ate dirt.
The government didn't come then.

703
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,473
We never got food for them.

704
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:02,430
Now they're older and we leave them
on the streets to smoke pot?

705
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,673
Are we worse than dogs?

706
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:09,956
But we won't let you kill them.
Blood will be spilled.

707
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:13,476
Your blood and our blood.
Do something!

708
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,952
Damn it! Stop this already!

709
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:53,874
Dalia!

710
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,390
Did you see how happy
my 700 liras made them?

711
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,353
Come in, Shaul. How are you?
- Okay.

712
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,673
What's new?

713
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,720
Don't worry.

714
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,474
That's how it goes.
Come in.

715
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:46,753
What did I hear? They tore down
your neighbor's room? -Yes.

716
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,195
Esther also set fire to a city truck.
- Oh dear.

717
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,153
Do you have to live here?

718
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,994
What's wrong with you?
Where do you want him to live?

719
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,958
I don't know.

720
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:01,158
People get themselves in a mess
and then expect someone to save them.

721
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,714
I'm going to make coffee. Want some,
Shaul? -Why not.

722
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,191
Shaul, what happened
between you and Dad?

723
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,991
Just a small fight
because of Baruch.

724
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:19,039
How do you feel? -Shaul, your dad
suffers because he loves you two.

725
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,596
Not just you. Baruch, too.

726
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,754
If you keep making trouble,
there will be nothing left of him.

727
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,677
See how he looks already?

728
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,713
Baruch got it from me.

729
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,160
From you?

730
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,359
It's still a little hot.

731
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,712
That's how it goes.
Everything will be okay.

732
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:02,159
Private Menashe, what did they do
to you? Draft you? -Yes.

733
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,914
Are you on leave, dear?
- I got two days off.

734
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,799
Probably to visit his momma.
- No, they must be scared of him.

735
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,354
They sent him home.

736
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,558
The officer comes and says, "At
attention!" He answers, "Me?!"

737
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,429
"Hell no, I won't!" -The guard saw
him laughing and fainted.

738
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,479
What do you want? What a soldier.
- Stop it, guys.

739
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:26,280
So what do you say, Menash?
- Has momma seen you, Menash?

740
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,835
Not yet. -Not yet?
Whoah! What a man!

741
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,514
Comes to tell the gang, first.
- Private Menashe.

742
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,318
They're tough in the army,
aren't they?

743
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,997
I'm going home.
- Come. Come.

744
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,478
Here. Here.

745
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,760
Give it here, give it here...

746
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,957
Here! -Catch!

747
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,513
What's wrong with you, anyway?

748
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:53,758
Get insulted, Menash?
- No, why? I'm tired.

749
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,638
Did they tire you out?
Poor guy.

750
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,073
Pass it here.

751
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,477
Here, here, pass it here.

752
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,354
See how he ran away?

753
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,712
Another soldier like that, oh no.
- What a sprint. -Did you see that?

754
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,679
What a coward.

755
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:29,355
Shaul, Shaul!

756
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,116
Your aunt died.

757
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,477
Shaul, Shaul.

758
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,919
A patrol car chased me all the way.
- Police? -Yes.

759
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,152
Listen what I need from you.
I can trust you.

760
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:46,711
Go find the guys and warn them.
Especially Baruch.

761
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,196
Wait, I'll leave before you.
If they ask about Kushi,

762
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:51,033
say he went
to Jaffa, to Yehiel, okay?

763
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:52,679
Great, thanks.

764
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,839
You! Come here.

765
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:02,559
Don't I know you from somewhere?

766
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,159
Empty your pockets.

767
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,516
What's your name? -Shaul.
- Shaul what? -Sheetrit.

768
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,318
Sheetrit! Get in the jeep.

769
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,399
Do you know him?

770
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,994
This is the last time
we see you around here, get it?

771
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:29,718
Tell your brother Officer Franko
sends regards from Rahamim Lolo.

772
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:34,198
Drop him off.
- Sit down. Not you. You get out.

773
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:03,317
Oh, Shaul. They destroyed
everything. A pogrom.

774
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:07,919
They came in the morning
and destroyed...

775
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,271
Every policeman
in Tel Aviv comes here.

776
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:17,789
What do they want from Shimon?
- If you don't stop it...

777
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:20,839
I'll rearrange your face!
Stop it, I said.

778
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,432
Kushi said you would hide.
- Good you came to tell me.

779
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,398
What am I doing here,
selling watermelons?

780
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,999
How did you know I'd come?
- I know the place.

781
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:35,952
They saw you. -Of course they saw.
He'll come, too.

782
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,872
I'm going now.
To Kiryat Ono.

783
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:44,233
I'll kill him! How much
do I have to tell you to shut up?

784
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,393
You are driving me crazy.

785
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,038
Detectives caught Rahamim.

786
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:55,753
Kushi went to Yehiel. To Jaffa.
He said you'd better leave.

787
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,877
Unbcle Shlomo asked you to go
over to their house.

788
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,033
He wants to talk to you.
- What does he want form me?

789
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:08,998
You haven't visited since Auntie
died. Dad will be mad if you don't.

790
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,234
I really don't care.
I'm splitting town anyway.

791
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,034
It's not nice if you don't go.

792
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:18,477
Besides, you'd better talk to Dad
before you go.

793
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,680
Did he say I should come?
- He hinted.

794
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,836
Go! I don't want to see you here.
- Avram, what's wrong with you?

795
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,310
What happened to you?
- And look who he brought!

796
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:44,710
One hand! -You wanted me to come,
did you? -I don't know.

797
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,916
He saw us together. Went crazy.
- Come in. Come in.

798
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,429
Shosh, Shosh.
Make them a cup of coffee.

799
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:58,394
Look what you did. -Stop in, Avram.
No fighting. Shame on you.

800
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:06,232
You won't work.
You worked enough in your life.

801
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,996
People get killed
for a few lira a day.

802
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,358
Bastard! -Not here, Avram.
I will really get angry.

803
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,557
He'll make a criminal out of me.
Just like him.

804
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,117
They know I'm shut up in here.
I don't come or go.

805
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:22,473
And that bastard does what he wants.
- Oh, cut the crap.

806
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:25,400
We're not the only ones sick of you.
Why do they have to suffer?

807
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,514
What about your promise?
What's with the job?

808
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:31,957
Shaul, all these troubles are
because of you. Go get a job.

809
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:34,199
What does everyone want from me?

810
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:37,193
You made him into an invalid,
by worrying so much. -Shut up!

811
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:39,870
You are eating yourself up.
You took him out of school.

812
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,594
Now, your heart is burning.
- That's how it is. All the time.

813
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,396
Not a day goes by
without anew problem.

814
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:50,678
Now go separate them.
- Don't worry. I'm going.

815
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,078
Watch out for all of them.
They are all sly foxes.

816
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,834
They will eat away at your soul.

817
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:01,033
Your dad is like a drug.
You'll get over him, like I did.

818
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,915
Shaul, Shaul, wait.
- Baruch, wait a minute.

819
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,360
Shaul, come here.

820
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:11,319
Go to this address.
It's my cousin's welding shop.

821
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,318
Tell him I sent you.

822
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,118
Comeback tomorrow.
- Not now. Avram, that's enough.

823
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,957
And don't do anything foolish.

824
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,278
Your brother isn't right.
He's not right.

825
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,040
I already know what to do.
- Do you have a plan?

826
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,639
Maybe Germany. We'll see.

827
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,194
I have some friends there.
Meanwhile, I'll go to Eilat.

828
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:43,039
What's with you? -What'll you do
there? -In Eilat? -In Germany?

829
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:48,278
Don't worry. They don't stifle
a person over there. Not like here.

830
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,713
But how will you leave the country?

831
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,996
What about the police?
- It's no problem.

832
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,671
Now listen. Hanani has to go
back to the neighborhood.

833
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:02,152
They talk about you. They say
you have a head on your shoulders.

834
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,589
They'll all offer you things.
Don't be a sucker. Don't take it.

835
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,993
They're burned out now.
Like me.

836
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:13,394
The neighborhood has no one anymore.
Like a single girl.

837
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,911
Get it? See you around.
- Okay.

838
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,632
Well, we're going now. Come.

839
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:35,674
Where will you be tonight.
- At the billiards, at eight or nine.

840
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,797
Good. Take care. -See you.

841
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,869
We'll go to my place.
No one will bother us.

842
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,797
No. It's better to go
to the old market. -Okay.

843
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:51,557
First, listen. Yehezkel, tell him.
- We'll tell you.

844
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:54,149
David and Moshe are both jerks.
- Tell him what it's all about.

845
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:58,399
I think I'm not ready yet. -You're
probably rolling in the dough.

846
01:16:58,720 --> 01:16:59,994
Oh, you're funny.

847
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:03,756
You don't do anything. Just stand
there and whistle if someone comes.

848
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,720
Don't you get it?
This is a golden opportunity.

849
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:08,275
How much is there, Yehezkel?
- I saw a couple thousand.

850
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:12,559
Where is it? -On Rothschild Street.
David and I moved furniture there.

851
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:17,158
You don't see that kind of place
every day. Marble everywhere.

852
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:21,155
The walls, the shower, the kitchen.
The living room's full of books.

853
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:24,757
All lined up in rows.
- Wait, didn't David see it?

854
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,674
David was talking to the lady
behind the bar with the drinks.

855
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,993
There was lots of jewelry. -No cash?
- Cash, but lots of jewelry too.

856
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,919
Very old stuff.
- I don't know if I'll come along.

857
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,354
Think about it. We're doing it
on the weekend, so tell us by then.

858
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:41,272
If you want to come, come.
If not, then no.

859
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,199
I got my enlistment papers.

860
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:47,117
Really? When?
- Two days ago. -Look.

861
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:55,798
I don't want to take a chance.
- We're not forcing you.

862
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,396
But think hard, before you say no.

863
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,756
Now, you're like a fool,
with your tongue hanging out.

864
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,960
What are you waiting for?
For God to bring you money?

865
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,951
We don't want to do this
all the time.

866
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,872
Just one big hit, and that's it.

867
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,631
Dalia. Dalia!

868
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,399
I thought you moved already.
- I'm not sure I'm moving.

869
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:20,315
Are you working already?
- Yes. At the welding shop.

870
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,914
That wouldn't suit you.

871
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:25,239
Which way are you headed?
- To town. To an English lesson.

872
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,512
Well, I have to go.

873
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,637
Come in, Shaul.

874
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,993
Have a seat.

875
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,480
How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

876
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,679
Don't worry. In another two days,
everything will be fine.

877
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,436
What's new at work?
What could be new?

878
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,356
Did he pay you?
- Not yet.

879
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:11,358
Looks like he's a cheapskate.

880
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,914
Didn't you tell him it's urgent?
- I told him.

881
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,798
I don't think I'm going
to stay on there.

882
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,960
Do you think I just shut
up all the time?

883
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:26,670
You're getting mad at me
for nothing. I think about you a lot.

884
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,149
In a month or two, I'll have paid
all the debts and then...

885
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,719
everything will be fine.

886
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,396
Have you heard from Baruch?
- No. He's probably in Eilat.

887
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:40,833
It's better that way.

888
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,674
Here, have something to eat.
- Eat. You probably haven't eaten.

889
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:17,118
Hi, Shaul.

890
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:19,954
It's good you came.

891
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:25,389
So? -How much do I get?
- One third.

892
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:29,515
You don't do anything. Just stand
outside. Leave the rest...

893
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:31,358
Leave the rest to Roni and me.

894
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,357
Here.
Take some cash for the meantime.

895
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:40,037
Forget it. -Take it. Buy something,
a shirt. I don't care.

896
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:44,270
Remind me and I'll pay you back.
- A quarter to eleven, okay?

897
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,031
Give some change.
Let's play a round.

898
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,798
Five, ten minutes. -Where's Yehezkel?
- I'm going there now.

899
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:08,112
Oh shit. -Why did you jump?
- I heard voices in the apartment.

900
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:11,036
There are people in there.
- Hey! Where are you going?

901
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,000
Somebody could come by!
Quiet.

902
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,071
It doesn't matter.
We'll act like we're peeing.

903
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:19,071
I think it's not from this
apartment. -Come here.

904
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,113
Don't get us in trouble, now.
- Okay. Now you climb up.

905
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,556
Maybe it's this apartment.
- Shaul, you go.

906
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,757
You'll go far, the two of you.

907
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,477
Next time you plan a break-in...

908
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:58,439
Let's say... -What will you have?
- Just a minute.

909
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,475
Lucky they didn't catch you.
- Oh, get off my back.

910
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,554
Who was it, Shaul?
- Just some poor old man.

911
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:08,593
What did you want to do? Kill him?
- Enough, already! -We're through.

912
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:12,151
He went out a minute and came in.
Good, enough! We're finished.

913
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,200
If you set out to do something,
go all the way.

914
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:15,594
Look who's talking.

915
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,957
My God, I quit my job because
of you. -Hear that? Because of us.

916
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:26,153
Decided yet?
- Bring something strong.

917
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,077
Did you see the look she gave him?

918
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,511
I'm telling you, a horny old gal.

919
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,672
Would you do her?
- If she's ask nicely.

920
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:46,194
Well, we're off.
- I'm sticking around some.

921
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,233
Where to?
- Home. -Where's Baruch?

922
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:39,431
In Eilat, I think. -Did you hear
that, Kushi? He went to Eilat.

923
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,149
Bus driver, get going!

924
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,630
Maybe he's around here anyway?
- I haven't seen him for a while.

925
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,995
Too bad.

926
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:02,679
What do you want from me?
- We miss him.

927
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,433
Do you know Clara?

928
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:09,233
I asked you, do you know Clara?
- No.

929
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:15,070
You lied twice. -You lied twice.
About Eilat and about Clara.

930
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:32,509
And Shaul? -Bring him along.
Baruch will be happy.

931
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:47,955
Wait!

932
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,598
Hanani! There he is.

933
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,513
He tried to run away, the bastard.
- Kushi, keep an eye on Clara.

934
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,119
Hey, Baruch. How's it going?

935
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:04,913
Do you know Shaya?

936
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,359
You sick of the gang?

937
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,358
Shaul here, he misses you too.

938
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,232
You're brother is not a man.

939
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:16,391
Believe me, Baruch.
No one's mad at you.

940
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:18,874
But we got insulted.

941
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:28,356
When you took the money, we said,
"It's cool. The boy has expenses.”

942
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:36,000
But little birds chirping
to the cops don't sit well with us.

943
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:13,037
Shaul, you go home.
I'll come around later.

944
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,314
Go.

945
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,514
So we finally get to see you.

946
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:30,072
I was looking for you
all night long.

947
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:36,353
I won't ask too many questions.
Tell me something.

948
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:39,233
I don't have anything to say.

949
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:43,438
What did you do all night long?
- What do you want from me?

950
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,391
All I want is for you
to come home. That's all.

951
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:50,833
I don't know what's going on
in your head,

952
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,951
but now,
it's time to come home with me.

953
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,351
Okay. I'll be there in a little bit.

954
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:48,073
"Light out of Nowhere"
