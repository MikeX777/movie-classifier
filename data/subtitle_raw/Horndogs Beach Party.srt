1
00:00:27,396 --> 00:00:28,890
Here she comes,
the woman that makes

2
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,010
you ask are those lash
marks or stretch marks?

3
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,230
Are those remnants of lustful
pains or varicose veins?

4
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:40,070
It's Sister Sadie Safeword!

5
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,460
Seriously?

6
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,320
That is my intro?

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,153
What?

8
00:00:44,153 --> 00:00:45,930
I, uh, said your name right,
didn't I?

9
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,930
I will have you know I am
100% Grade A fresh as a daisy.

10
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,830
Stretch marks?

11
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,630
I don't see any!

12
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,210
I don't see any on these pumpkins.

13
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,060
Anyway, enough of that, Cretin,

14
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,740
how are my movie loving maggots?

15
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,240
Are you ready for another
painful picture

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,951
to pound your putrid
peepers into submission?

17
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,700
Good to hear, my wormy weirdos.

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,100
You have pleased your mistress.

19
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,880
But do not think that
I will go easy on you.

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,495
I'm in a very torturous mood.

21
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:25,150
Slave, bring me the sack
of cinematic Sadism!

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,360
Thank you, Slave.

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,630
You will be thrashed soundly
for your loyal service.

24
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,370
Let's see what we have today.

25
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,050
What in the Holy Hell?

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,660
Horndog's Beach Party.

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,220
What, what is this?

28
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,980
Is this like a porno or something?

29
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,140
Is this even a real movie?

30
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,324
It's on tape, isn't it?

31
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:55,780
Of course it's on tape.

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,550
But look at it, look at the label.

33
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,890
It looks like child wrote this.

34
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,430
A movie is a movie is a movie, right?

35
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,080
I mean, do you think our
audience tunes in for high art?

36
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,080
I would hope that they
tune in for these babies.

37
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,230
The movies are just,
how you say, gravy.

38
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,260
Whatever helps you sleep at
night, Sister.

39
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,590
Don't make me come over there!

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,720
Anyway, let's get to the
movie or whatever this is.

41
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,170
I don't know,
your guess is as good as mine.

42
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,860
If is beach party,

43
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,420
perhaps there will be girls
in bikinis.

44
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,390
Or maybe there will be sand
where it doesn't belong.

45
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:49,620
Now that is true torture!

46
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,190
I will be back to check on

47
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,560
the progress of your torture soon.

48
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,890
You know, I went to beach once.

49
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,740
There was beautiful sun,
happy people,

50
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,650
children laughing, I hated it!

51
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,700
Come on down to

52
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,750
the 10th Annual Horndog's
Beach Party.

53
00:03:22,664 --> 00:03:25,980
Located on beautiful
Venice Beach, California.

54
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,040
And oh boy,
do we have all sorts of fun

55
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,910
in store for your whole family.

56
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,390
Plus, our famous Wet T-Shirt
Competition for adults only.

57
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,160
This Sunday, don't miss it.

58
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,884
Sponsored by the Riverside
County Jaycees.

59
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,220
Hey Man.

60
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,860
Yeah.

61
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,810
Yeah, I'm out here by the
paddle boats.

62
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,580
Alright.

63
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,605
Yeah, I'll see you in a little bit.

64
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,340
This is so awesome that your aunt

65
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,240
let us have the condo for the weekend!

66
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,080
Well, at least part of it.

67
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,820
You know, Auntie Brinke never
lets a buck go to waste.

68
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,800
Hmm, I really hope the
two girls are actually cool.

69
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,994
I'm sure they'll be good.

70
00:07:48,994 --> 00:07:51,400
It's just I hope they
don't party too hard.

71
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,170
When did you become such a buzzkill?

72
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,241
Didn't you use to rule
the beach party scene?

73
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:01,900
That was like 30 years ago!

74
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,660
Thanks Man, get ya on the app.

75
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,080
Dude, this is gonna be so sick.

76
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,913
Look at this.

77
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,583
Hey Fellas.

78
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,500
Huh, uh, I guess nobody's
here to meet us yet.

79
00:08:57,492 --> 00:08:58,325
Let me see.

80
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,459
It says if this guy named
Dusty isn't here

81
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,343
just get the key from under
the doormat.

82
00:09:07,343 --> 00:09:08,176
Oh.

83
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:11,898
Here it is.

84
00:09:11,898 --> 00:09:13,550
Got it!

85
00:09:31,636 --> 00:09:32,469
Not bad!

86
00:09:33,371 --> 00:09:34,380
Not bad at all.

87
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,670
This will do.

88
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,441
Two bad it's only two bedrooms.

89
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:40,530
Yeah.

90
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,660
We'll just have to take turns

91
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,102
when we got the chicks in there.

92
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:48,102
Oh, yeah!

93
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,510
Hey, nice day, Ladies!

94
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,373
Hi!

95
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:05,890
So you think we can do it?

96
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,220
What?

97
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,053
Come on, Man!

98
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:09,450
The best beach party ever!

99
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,513
Hope so.

100
00:10:11,513 --> 00:10:14,308
I guess we'll have to see what
our weekend roommates think.

101
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:15,141
Yeah.

102
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,093
Hey, you okay?

103
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,520
Yeah, just don't like travel.

104
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,430
That's true.

105
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,280
Those 4 a.m. flights suck.

106
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,620
Hey, do you need the bathroom?

107
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,180
I'm gonna take a shower.

108
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,620
Ah, no, I'm cool.

109
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,090
Cool.

110
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:31,923
Sweet.

111
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,274
Check under the doormat for
the key.

112
00:10:56,274 --> 00:10:59,890
Okay.

113
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,748
They must already have it.

114
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:05,697
Hmm, maybe they're
already down at the beach?

115
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:31,408
Hey, this place is pretty sweet!

116
00:11:32,752 --> 00:11:34,941
I've been here a few
times back in high school.

117
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:36,191
Always had fun.

118
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,910
Killer view!

119
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:58,222
I can't wait to get down there.

120
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:07,308
I think I hear the shower.

121
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:17,510
I'm gonna go pee and change.

122
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,220
Shouldn't you wait until
she's done?

123
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,230
It'll be fine.

124
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,030
It's a great way to meet new people.

125
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,093
Hello!

126
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,430
I hope you don't mind.

127
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,380
We just got in and I need to
go change.

128
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:39,803
Is that okay?

129
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,670
Uh, sure.

130
00:12:45,202 --> 00:12:48,616
Thanks.

131
00:12:48,616 --> 00:12:51,136
It sure is a nice place here.

132
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:56,136
Mhmm.

133
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,400
I'm gonna go change real quick

134
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,048
and go down to the beach.

135
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:01,304
You should join us.

136
00:13:01,304 --> 00:13:02,548
Sounds like fun!

137
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:07,997
Whoops, sorry!

138
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,593
What was that?

139
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,300
Whoa!

140
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,840
Okay, what's the deal?

141
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,120
They're guys!

142
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,953
What?

143
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,103
Who are you?

144
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,580
Why are you here?

145
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,980
We're obviously here
because of your double D.

146
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:40,180
You son of a bitch.

147
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,110
Cory, call the police.

148
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,750
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

149
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,280
We're here because of the
Desired Destination Rental.

150
00:13:48,043 --> 00:13:48,876
Hold up.

151
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,960
Here's our receipt for the
Desired Destination Rental.

152
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,150
It says Stacy and Loren.

153
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,680
Yeah, I'm Stacy.

154
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,513
And I'm Loren.

155
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,300
So, who are you two?

156
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,283
I'm Dusty.

157
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:12,289
And I'm Cory.

158
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,490
What the hell are we
gonna do about this?

159
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,380
Do about what?

160
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,830
We already paid Brinke or
whoever, here's our receipt.

161
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,530
There's no hotel rooms within
20 miles,

162
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,640
we just have to make it work.

163
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,310
I'm gonna call Auntie Brinke
about this.

164
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,090
Excuse me, is it okay
if I go back and change.

165
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,090
Uh, I'm gonna go get
something on too, okay?

166
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,133
So...

167
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,360
I'll come change too.

168
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,920
Hello?

169
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,160
Hi, Auntie Brinke.

170
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,400
Oh, hi Dusty.

171
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,350
Did you and Cory make it okay?

172
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,550
Yes we did, thank you.

173
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,800
Is everything alright?

174
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,620
Well, there's a slight issue.

175
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,490
Oh no, what's that?

176
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,140
We are having to share it
with a couple

177
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,490
of guys who rented through
Desired Destination.

178
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,890
What?

179
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,590
I thought I turned those two down.

180
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,560
Well, they're here.

181
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,220
That doesn't make any sense.

182
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,390
I specifically turned down
Brad and Tad

183
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,080
and accepted Loren and Stacy
so there

184
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,760
wouldn't be any boy trouble.

185
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,880
Loren and Stacy are here.

186
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,250
Did they bring Brad and Tad
with them?

187
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,900
If so, I'm really gonna be pissed.

188
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,780
I told them no more than
two for their group.

189
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,580
No, there is no Brad and Tad here.

190
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,660
Well that's good.

191
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,850
What two boys did Loren
and Stacy bring with them?

192
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,750
Just themselves.

193
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,810
Well then I don't see the issue.

194
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,780
Hopefully they're a couple of
nice girls.

195
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,460
No, Loren and Stacy are the boys.

196
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,650
Really?

197
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,060
Did Brad and Tad change their
names just to get the place?

198
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,960
No, Brad and Tad are nowhere here!

199
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,920
Loren are Stacy are two
totally different guys.

200
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,740
So instead of Brad and Tad,
I accepted

201
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,520
two other boys that I thought
were girls?

202
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,400
Yes!

203
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,150
Huh, I wonder why their
parents named them like that?

204
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:31,390
Oh well.

205
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,440
So is there anything we can..

206
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,740
Oh, I'm so sorry, I gotta get going.

207
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,410
I'm sure you'll all work it out.

208
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,360
Oh, and don't get too crazy there,

209
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,270
Brigitte still likes to freak
out and call

210
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,670
the neighborhood association
at the first sign of fun.

211
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,503
But..

212
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,050
You know, she had the
nerve to call them a few

213
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,200
weeks ago when I had
the music up too loud.

214
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,120
It's a good thing she didn't know

215
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,320
why I really had it up so loud.

216
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,670
I bet her gardener is still smiling...

217
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,120
Anyway, y'all have a great time.

218
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,953
Love you.

219
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,570
I'm in insanity land.

220
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,510
Yes?

221
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:16,882
Hi, I'm Brad, and this is Tad.

222
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:18,040
'Sup.

223
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,620
Of course you are.

224
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,610
You know it, Dude.

225
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,490
Are you Loren or Stacy?

226
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,430
I'm Dusty.

227
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,160
Ooh, dirty name.

228
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,190
Cool, Brah.

229
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,570
Anyway, is Loren or Stacy here?

230
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,180
Just wanted to tell 'em no
hard feelings

231
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,970
on losing the place to them.

232
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,900
We got a room just down the street

233
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,640
and was wondering if
those two chicks wanted

234
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,340
to join us in that Horndog
Beach Party competition?

235
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,910
They are dudes and not your type.

236
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,220
Bro, that sucks.

237
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,720
Dude, I know.

238
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,570
What's up, Bro?

239
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,390
She was so uncool, Bro.

240
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,910
Dude, that chick definitely
had some

241
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,650
kind of massive stick up her ass.

242
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,483
Totally Bro.

243
00:17:58,483 --> 00:18:00,320
I mean, what are we gonna do?

244
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,760
Those two chicks have the
best spot

245
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,130
on the beach and we can't
even use it.

246
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,510
I don't know, Dude.

247
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,030
And what about those
two chicks being dudes?

248
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,880
I mean, what's up with that?

249
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,910
Dude, I think we may have to do

250
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,100
something about these two dudes.

251
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,720
Like what, Bro?

252
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,610
Dude, the way I look at it,

253
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,330
if we can't have the
best spot on the beach

254
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,250
for a party, we're gonna
make sure these two dudes

255
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,610
and Miss Stick up her ass
don't win the best beach party.

256
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,510
I knew it!

257
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,900
They're planning a party.

258
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:39,510
Totally, Bro.

259
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,030
Totally, Dude.

260
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,170
However, they do look very nice.

261
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,280
No, I mustn't give in to temptation!

262
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,040
I've gotta let the
neighborhood association know.

263
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,370
Right.

264
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,330
They won't take my calls
anymore without proof.

265
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,780
Well, if it's proof they
want, it's proof they'll get!

266
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:15,730
Dude, what are we gonna do
about this?

267
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,563
I don't know.

268
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:17,920
Um, it's really awkward.

269
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,860
Uh, we could make sure,
we could go talk to them,

270
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,350
or try to figure out how
to make it less awkward.

271
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,540
I mean,
I guess we could talk to them,

272
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,880
but I thought we were just
gonna have

273
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,910
like a dude's party weekend.

274
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,910
This was gonna be sick.

275
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,490
Now we got two chicks here?

276
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,323
But I mean, they're not

277
00:19:32,323 --> 00:19:33,610
half bad looking, you know.

278
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,110
Right, they ain't ugly.

279
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,943
No.

280
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,750
Well, we gotta do something.

281
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,230
They saw me in my underwear,
so it's already kinda awkward.

282
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,290
I do think that I am going to
go talk

283
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,600
to Cory though and try to
make amends.

284
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,900
That would be a good idea.

285
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,960
So it's less awkward all weekend.

286
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,860
I don't know, Man.

287
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,490
Look, Dude, just go talk to her.

288
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,120
Uh, yeah.

289
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,530
You don't have to apologize
or anything, just talk to her.

290
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,450
Yeah.

291
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,290
I mean,
she's really cute and I think

292
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,875
it would make things
better for the weekend.

293
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,910
This is gonna be good for you.

294
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,069
Yeah, yeah.

295
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:18,427
Alright.

296
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:26,290
Hi.

297
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,540
Okay.

298
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,373
Hey.

299
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,600
Yeah, um,
she's being a little more

300
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,570
stubborn than I thought she
would be.

301
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,460
She's kinda stressed out.

302
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,180
It turns out the two
we're sharing the condo

303
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,930
with are actually a couple of guys.

304
00:20:45,232 --> 00:20:47,658
Mhmm.

305
00:20:47,658 --> 00:20:49,950
Yeah, they're kinda cute.

306
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:56,280
Hmm, I dunno,
we'll just see how it goes.

307
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,420
Okay, tell ya what.

308
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,580
You guys come around three,
by that time

309
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,750
it'll be super late and Dusty just

310
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,700
totally has to go along with
the party.

311
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:09,955
Oh, shoot.

312
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,750
One of the straps of my top ripped.

313
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,150
I have to get a new one
before the party starts.

314
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,810
Well yes, but I'm trying to
start with the top on first.

315
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,060
Okay, see you guys around three.

316
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,940
Okay, bye.

317
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,773
Come in!

318
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,950
Oh, I'm sorry.

319
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,000
I can come back if you like.

320
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,990
No, it's okay.

321
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,150
I just wanted to
apologize for what happened

322
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,650
in the bathroom earlier today.

323
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,440
That's so sweet of you.

324
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,310
I just don't want you thinking

325
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,710
I'm some sort of creep or anything.

326
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,930
Let's just say there were
a few misunderstandings.

327
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,970
Yeah, I'll say.

328
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,760
So, what makes you boys
come out here to Cali?

329
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,930
Stacy always wanted to come

330
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,792
to this beach party weekend,
so I...

331
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:08,420
Oh, you mean the Horndog
Beach Party?

332
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,460
Uh, yeah, uh.

333
00:22:13,615 --> 00:22:14,448
Oh yeah.

334
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:21,909
Yeah, Sex Panther.

335
00:22:26,108 --> 00:22:28,140
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

336
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,597
He's going to be fun.

337
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,830
How about the, uh,
whatever the hell that was?

338
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,880
Painful enough for you,
my masochistic minions?

339
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,110
I don't know about you,

340
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,038
but I think this one
has left me speechless.

341
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,290
No, you know what?

342
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,070
Just for that outburst,

343
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,140
I think I am going to
talk about this movie.

344
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,450
First off,
something I'm sure none of you

345
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,530
would have any experience with,
but this movie

346
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,784
has more padding than a bra
on prom night.

347
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,670
Not too mention the gardener,

348
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,600
who is apparently in
totally different time zone

349
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,340
from everyone else around
him that he's talking to.

350
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,010
Then we have the male and the
female lead,

351
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,250
and they have approximately
a 20 foot height difference.

352
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,220
Step stool, buy one!

353
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:01,240
Then there is this lady who's trying

354
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,100
to stop all these frisky frolics,

355
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,070
but she's the kind of woman
who would

356
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,900
never turn down a good time,
trust me.

357
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,290
It takes one to know one.

358
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,480
And, and..

359
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,840
Playing Devil's Advocate here,

360
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,250
I should mention that Uncle Rob,
I mean,

361
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,210
our producer, of this program,
in conjunction

362
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,670
with the award losing
Hollywood Studios

363
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,370
that provide our top shelf
filmed entertainment,

364
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:31,930
require you contractually to say

365
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,560
at least one positive thing.

366
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,220
Brinke Stevens.

367
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:41,220
We are in the presence of
true scream queen royalty.

368
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:46,730
I bow to her in all of
her beauty and glory.

369
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,560
See, I knew you had it in ya!

370
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,860
That check better clear.

371
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,560
Anything else you wanna say?

372
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,440
Anything else I have to say.

373
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,360
Have you even been watching
the movie?

374
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,430
In so many ways.

375
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:02,520
In so many ways?

376
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,580
What does this even mean,
in so many ways?

377
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,650
I mean I was thinking about
the film.

378
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,780
You went around the corner
for another

379
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,260
one of those special
massages again, didn't you?

380
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,710
Yes, the $20 bill

381
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,110
was just burning a hole in my pocket.

382
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,530
So you leave me alone
to suffer with this movie?

383
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,100
Well, not totally alone.

384
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,140
I think it is time to turn
the screws

385
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,290
ever tighter on you,
my filthy maggots.

386
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,950
Roll the rest of the movie!

387
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,060
Announcer, you may want to consider

388
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,800
Purelling yourself, thoroughly.

389
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,660
Hey Dude, you all right?

390
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,493
Yep!

391
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,680
Oh, come on!

392
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,433
Look, I know things got
mixed up with the reservation

393
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,270
or whatever,
but that's not our fault.

394
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,880
I know.

395
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,713
What?

396
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,720
Didn't catch that.

397
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,928
I know.

398
00:26:19,928 --> 00:26:21,320
I'm sorry about that as well.

399
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,113
It's cool.

400
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,130
It's just this weekend
is not turning out

401
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,110
the way I thought it would at all.

402
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,050
So, what did you have in mind.

403
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,110
I hoped it could be an all nice

404
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,480
and relaxing weekend on the beach.

405
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,720
Relax, are you serious?

406
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,170
This is like one of the
biggest college

407
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,550
party weekends ever for this area.

408
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,520
Why would you pick this weekend?

409
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,200
I don't know.

410
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:56,448
Hmm, alright.

411
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,263
Interesting.

412
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,400
What?

413
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,440
I think you just wanted to come

414
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,810
down here and party all weekend.

415
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:04,850
No, I just..

416
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:09,040
Look, did you know it was gonna
be like this this weekend?

417
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,800
Yes, but that doesn't mean anything.

418
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,260
But you did know, and you still

419
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,560
chose these dates for your weekend.

420
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,500
What are you, a psychology major?

421
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:23,720
Uh, actually yeah, yeah.

422
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:26,846
I just finished my first
year in grad school.

423
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:27,965
Perfect.

424
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:29,840
Hey Dusty!

425
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,890
Yes?

426
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,570
Can you take me swimsuit shopping?

427
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,090
Mine just broke.

428
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:36,300
Sure, I'm gonna get a coffee
as well.

429
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,133
Great.

430
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,700
It wouldn't work out here.

431
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,220
This part of the beach is shared

432
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,600
with the crazy neighborhood
lady next door,

433
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,570
she will call the association

434
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,260
about everything that happens here.

435
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,093
Oh really?

436
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,690
So why doesn't she just move,
why does she stay here?

437
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,110
Because she loves this beach.

438
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,460
This is where she used
to spring break herself.

439
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,240
Cory, you ready?

440
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,820
Yep, I'm ready.

441
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,120
Sorry about the attitude earlier.

442
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,320
Oh, it's cool, me too.

443
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,140
See ya.

444
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,973
Bye.

445
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,940
They left, you can come out!

446
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,380
So what happened?

447
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,080
Uh, I don't know.

448
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,350
I was talking to Cory and
she came on to me, and..

449
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,810
Dude, alright!

450
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,220
And then I freaked out
and rushed to the bathroom.

451
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,053
What?

452
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,163
Really?

453
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,940
I rinsed the shower out
pretty good.

454
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,720
Oh, gross.

455
00:28:58,050 --> 00:28:58,883
It was wild.

456
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,110
It took everything I had just
to knock

457
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,260
on her door and I hadn't been in

458
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,110
a situation like that since Jennifer.

459
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,000
Baby steps, Man.

460
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,183
Baby steps.

461
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:25,810
So, what are the odds
of hosting a party here?

462
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,600
It might actually be
a little bit difficult.

463
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,180
Apparently their neighbor
is a pain in the ass.

464
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,013
Why don't we just find

465
00:29:32,013 --> 00:29:32,910
somewhere else down the beach?

466
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,570
No, no, no, no, no, no.

467
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:38,250
We said we're gonna throw
the best beach party ever,

468
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,720
and we're gonna do it.

469
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,620
What about Dusty?

470
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,770
She seems to hold the key as to

471
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,160
whether or not we can have
the party here.

472
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,380
Don't worry about her.

473
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,930
I think I can get her on board.

474
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,120
I do know that Cory's all on board.

475
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,953
That's good.

476
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,290
We just gotta figure out what we're

477
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,210
gonna do about this Brigitte chick.

478
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,680
What if we just go talk to her?

479
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,192
Smart.

480
00:30:02,192 --> 00:30:04,844
Then we'll know who we're
dealing with.

481
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:08,365
Alright.

482
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,100
I didn't realize it would
be that hard of a decision.

483
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,340
It is a very important decision.

484
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:40,131
Nah, the first one never
quite works out.

485
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,430
That's why so many.

486
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,210
You should really try some on.

487
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,530
I don't know,
I'm just not in the mood.

488
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,040
Why, what's the matter?

489
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,740
Well, this whole weekend is not

490
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,690
working out the way I thought
it would.

491
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,330
It really was kind
of a stressful morning.

492
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,800
Between Loren and Stacy,

493
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,260
Auntie Brinke isn't much help,

494
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,710
and then this Brad and Tad
guys come by.

495
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,190
Really, who are they?

496
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,590
Just a couple
of frat jocks that were

497
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,440
in the running for the condo
as well.

498
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,670
Nah, maybe my
freshman or sophomore year.

499
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,500
They seemed like
a couple of real idiots.

500
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:27,723
You know what?

501
00:31:27,723 --> 00:31:29,220
I really think you should try
this on.

502
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,570
Trust me, it'll make you feel better.

503
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,693
Whatever.

504
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,520
I think the last semester of college

505
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,570
really got the good of you.

506
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,920
I mean, all these clinical classes

507
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,150
and the extra classes kicked
your ass.

508
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,630
Well, I'm just glad
it's over and what I want

509
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:55,870
is just a quiet nice weekend
away from everything.

510
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,690
Well, it is definitely
away from everything.

511
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,980
But I don't think it should
be quiet.

512
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,700
And I don't think you
feel it should be either.

513
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,850
I don't know.

514
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,430
Well, it's a start.

515
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,170
But again, never the first one.

516
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,480
Here, try this.

517
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,703
There we go, the first
cracks are starting to show.

518
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,090
So what do you think
about Loren and Stacy?

519
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,980
Well I guess they're good guys.

520
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,525
I talked to Stacy this morning.

521
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:42,000
Really, what did he
say about this morning?

522
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,940
Well we had mutual apologies
and understandings.

523
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,853
How 'bout you?

524
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,570
Loren came in to apologize.

525
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,710
He's such a cutie.

526
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,220
Ooh, I know what that means.

527
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:01,610
Hmm, this one
goes to the maybe pile.

528
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:02,760
Getting closer.

529
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,650
Mhmm, so are we going to participate

530
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,100
on the beach parties tonight?

531
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:11,460
Look, it's not going to be
able to work.

532
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,020
We can't risk getting into trouble

533
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,170
by the bitchy Brigitte
and the association.

534
00:33:16,526 --> 00:33:20,650
So what you are saying is that
we need to get rid of her.

535
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,590
In a sense, yes.

536
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,630
At least, we have to get her

537
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,440
to go along with us having a party.

538
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,933
Hmm.

539
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,530
At least we have plenty of
other parties

540
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,300
to go even if we can't host one.

541
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,050
Well, I'm not really giving
up hope

542
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:45,070
because I kinda invited some
people over.

543
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,080
What?

544
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,260
Um, I may have mentioned to Steph

545
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,750
and Becky that we're hosting
a party.

546
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:52,583
You did?

547
00:33:53,726 --> 00:33:55,050
Yeah.

548
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,170
They are going to invite everybody!

549
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,690
Probably.

550
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:02,340
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

551
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,173
What are we gonna do?

552
00:34:03,173 --> 00:34:04,714
What am I gonna do?

553
00:34:04,714 --> 00:34:06,625
We're going to get into so
much trouble.

554
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:09,970
Auntie Brinke's not going
to have her condo intact.

555
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:10,970
It's going to be ruined by us.

556
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,370
Okay, okay, okay.

557
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,460
Calm down.

558
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,293
It'll be okay.

559
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,150
How can you say that?

560
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:20,140
Because anybody who can rock this

561
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,480
swimsuit like you do can do anything.

562
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,093
Mhmm.

563
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,070
Um, looks perfect.

564
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,203
You know what?

565
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:47,350
We're going to host the best
Horndog Beach Party tonight.

566
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,010
Yes!

567
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,140
Oh my God, I'm so happy.

568
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,810
We have a lot to do.

569
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:53,643
Yeah.

570
00:35:04,432 --> 00:35:06,250
Did you pick your suit yet?

571
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:11,060
Um, mhmm, yep.

572
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,780
Isn't that the first on?

573
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,260
Yeah, so?

574
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,350
Let's go,
we have a lot of work to do.

575
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:35,960
Okay, so let me get this straight.

576
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:40,790
You want to invite a few
friends over

577
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:44,210
and have a party on my beach.

578
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,790
On the beach that we share.

579
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:50,000
You want to have a giant sin party

580
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,600
with drinking and drugs and fornications..

581
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,020
I wouldn't that far.

582
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:00,440
And get your fornication
juices all over my beach?

583
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,800
I think not!

584
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:09,060
And I am warning you, I will
be watching and taking notes.

585
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,740
So you go back to your
weekend condo

586
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:21,580
and get some sun, maybe
splash in the water a little,

587
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,240
but you will not be having
a party on my beach!

588
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,040
Do you understand?

589
00:36:29,594 --> 00:36:30,427
Uh.

590
00:36:30,427 --> 00:36:31,260
Good day.

591
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,563
Any ideas?

592
00:36:39,563 --> 00:36:41,757
I'm sure we'll figure
something out.

593
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,680
What the hell?

594
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,260
Bro, you got him so good!

595
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,040
Good throw yourself, Dude.

596
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,250
Seriously, what the hell is
that about?

597
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,320
That's for taking our
room for the weekend.

598
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,510
Yeah, you totally snaked our room

599
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,920
pretending to be girls!

600
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,390
We didn't pretend anything!

601
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,150
Whoa, you just stop right there.

602
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,420
Hey, we applied just like
everyone else.

603
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,240
It's not our fault they
mixed up the names.

604
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,073
Yeah?

605
00:37:05,073 --> 00:37:06,260
Well because of you,
we don't have the

606
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,280
best spot on the beach to
host a party.

607
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,113
Yeah, you tell 'em, Bro.

608
00:37:09,113 --> 00:37:11,620
We're not going to be
able to have a party either.

609
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,020
Yeah, because we're
gonna make sure you don't.

610
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:18,280
Whatever, screw you guys.

611
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,800
Let's go.

612
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,950
Yeah, you go on and hide!

613
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,260
Yeah, you tell 'em, Bro!

614
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,670
You okay Dude?

615
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,262
Uh, yeah Bro.

616
00:37:34,262 --> 00:37:36,733
I just think I saw something
awesome over there.

617
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,769
Hey.

618
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:47,250
Hey, what's the matter with
you guys?

619
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,190
I'm starting to think having
a party

620
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,360
isn't really in the cards anymore.

621
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,340
What makes you say that?

622
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,390
We tried to talk to Brigitte
next door.

623
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,530
Ooh, it didn't go well, did it?

624
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,290
And a couple of jerks
started throwing water balloons

625
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,880
at us and said it was
for taking their room.

626
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,080
And we're not going
to have a party anymore.

627
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,913
What?

628
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,260
Were they a couple frat
looking boys

629
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,390
that kept saying brah and bro
a lot?

630
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:17,970
Yeah.

631
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,910
Hmm, sounds like Brad and Tad.

632
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,200
Those guys are a couple
of real douches, by the way.

633
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,670
Well, it's time to
start thinking positive.

634
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,503
Oh really?

635
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,000
Yes, because we are going
to have us a beach party here!

636
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,500
Are you serious?

637
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:37,249
Yes.

638
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:39,370
So what brought this about?

639
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,370
Well, maybe you were a bit
right earlier

640
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:43,350
that you guys came here for a party

641
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:46,370
and it took me a while to
realize that I did too.

642
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,530
Mhmm, alright.

643
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,370
That's awesome!

644
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,980
So what do we have to do to
get ready?

645
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:57,710
Oh, and what are we gonna
do about your neighbor?

646
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,390
I'm not sure about her yet,

647
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,490
but I know the first thing we
need to do

648
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:04,460
is to find everything we need
to decorate.

649
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,120
Yes, because we need balloons, booze,

650
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,500
tiki torches, booze, hats, booze.

651
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,470
Oh wait, I forgot something.

652
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,470
Did I mention booze?

653
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,560
Uh, I suppose I better go get
my wallet.

654
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,060
Um, is he alright?

655
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,540
Yeah, uh.

656
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:29,770
He actually just got out of a
really serious relationship.

657
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,603
Three years.

658
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,770
They were engaged.

659
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:37,120
Turns out at the end of our
fall semester,

660
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,790
he found out that she was cheating
on him for the last year.

661
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,720
Oh wow, that is so sad
she would do that to him.

662
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,650
Yeah, he took it really hard.

663
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,874
Almost dropped out of school.

664
00:39:48,874 --> 00:39:49,707
That poor guy.

665
00:39:50,861 --> 00:39:51,970
Yeah.

666
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,470
It's actually pretty amazing he's

667
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,360
even on this trip in the
first place.

668
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,510
He might kinda put up a
little bit of a front,

669
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,520
so if it seems like he's acting

670
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,250
a little bit off, that's why.

671
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,522
He's such a sweetie, though.

672
00:40:06,522 --> 00:40:08,070
Yeah.

673
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:12,070
Hey, if you can, try to take
it easy on him a little bit.

674
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,730
Don't rush him into anything.

675
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,663
Okay.

676
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,110
Okay, ready to go.

677
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:18,943
Alright, nice.

678
00:40:18,943 --> 00:40:19,776
Yeah, we can just..

679
00:40:19,776 --> 00:40:21,390
Hey, wait, Loren.

680
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:23,940
You're going with me to the
party store.

681
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,860
Oh, uh sure.

682
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,060
Can I have your keys?

683
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,893
Awesome.

684
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,757
Don't worry, she will
take great care of him.

685
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,380
Look at them.

686
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,410
They're not even trying to
hide it.

687
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:44,337
Oh my, ooh!

688
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,430
Oh my God!

689
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,350
Oh!
Oh!

690
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,284
Are you okay?

691
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,790
Nerds!
Nerds!

692
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,510
What is this?

693
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,343
Seriously?

694
00:40:55,343 --> 00:40:56,550
Chocolate milk?

695
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,383
You goobers!

696
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:01,110
Oh, don't worry,
it does the body good.

697
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:01,943
Right, Dude?

698
00:41:01,943 --> 00:41:02,776
Oh, yeah, Brah!

699
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,300
Oh yes, this is good stuff.

700
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:13,610
This is not funny.

701
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,443
No, it's not!

702
00:41:14,443 --> 00:41:15,720
I think it's kinda funny.

703
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,070
What about you, Brah?

704
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:17,970
Oh, let me look.

705
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:22,679
I think it's even funnier!

706
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,683
Let's go.

707
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:26,516
Yeah.

708
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,633
Seriously?

709
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,800
This never gets old.

710
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,633
Yeah, Bro.

711
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,080
Ooh, whoa, what happened?

712
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,910
Brad and Tad.

713
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,060
That's what happened.

714
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,110
What is it with those guys?

715
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,990
I don't know, but I know
what we need to finish it.

716
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:57,830
What?

717
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,800
Cory.

718
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,940
Yes?

719
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:02,140
What time are Steph
and Becky coming over?

720
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,950
I told them around three.

721
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,290
Give them a call and
tell them the party's on

722
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,070
and we need their help for a special

723
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,760
situation as soon as possible.

724
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:14,340
Alright, I'm going to
give them a call right now.

725
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,241
Hey Cory?

726
00:42:17,241 --> 00:42:18,154
Yes?

727
00:42:18,154 --> 00:42:19,920
You can shower first if you'd like.

728
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,753
Thank you.

729
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:22,943
Please do.

730
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,720
So what are we gonna do?

731
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:31,680
You know we have to get some supplies.

732
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,870
Right, but what about Brad
and Tad?

733
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,633
Hmm.

734
00:42:36,677 --> 00:42:38,927
We're going to have to
get some distractions.

735
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:41,663
What?

736
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:45,310
Sorry man, you're going to
have to take one for the team.

737
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,580
You just want me to go out
there unarmed

738
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,060
and just run around taking it?

739
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,610
Pretty much, but not unarmed.

740
00:43:03,544 --> 00:43:04,970
How'd it go, Bro?

741
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,520
It looks awesome, Dude.

742
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,900
Oh, nice!

743
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,160
What the hell is that joker doing?

744
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:12,606
Hey Guys.

745
00:43:19,336 --> 00:43:20,690
What the?

746
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:21,812
Oh, Dude, gross.

747
00:43:21,812 --> 00:43:24,112
It smells like,
it smells like pickle juice.

748
00:43:25,848 --> 00:43:26,681
Oh.

749
00:43:26,681 --> 00:43:28,020
Screw you guys.

750
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:28,853
Oh!

751
00:43:28,853 --> 00:43:29,686
Oh, Jesus!

752
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:32,390
Oh, poor boys.

753
00:43:35,566 --> 00:43:37,520
Oh, look at him go.

754
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,720
Will he be alright?

755
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,240
Oh, yeah, he'll be fine.

756
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,520
He was all-college track and field.

757
00:43:43,574 --> 00:43:44,580
He ran the 1600.

758
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,810
Nice.

759
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,640
Looks like the coast is clear.

760
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:59,920
Oh, that is so wrong.

761
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,450
Maybe a car wash first?

762
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:11,970
Guys, I got a hold of Becky
and Steph

763
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:13,360
and they'll be here in like...

764
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,183
Hello?

765
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,050
Where did they all go?

766
00:45:17,864 --> 00:45:18,811
Hello?

767
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:22,250
Oh, I'm so sorry.

768
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,580
Uh, it's okay.

769
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:29,330
The other two went to go get supplies.

770
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:32,220
I tried knocking to let
you know what was going on.

771
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,300
Thanks for letting me know.

772
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,133
Okay then.

773
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:37,430
Um, I'll just have to take
a shower when you're done.

774
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:38,600
Okay.

775
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,000
Loren?

776
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,833
Yeah?

777
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:41,730
Can you please hand me

778
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,360
the shampoo bottle on the counter?

779
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,540
Uh, sure.

780
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:49,110
Just hand it through the curtain.

781
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:51,243
Oh!

782
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,000
Well, now it's time to
get you all cleaned up.

783
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,710
Uh, I, uh, I haven't been..

784
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:02,350
There, how was that?

785
00:46:03,811 --> 00:46:05,869
That was really good.

786
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:13,051
Gettin' a bit of a late start,
ain't ya?

787
00:47:13,051 --> 00:47:16,222
Oh, you know, it's a bit
of a last minute addition.

788
00:47:16,222 --> 00:47:19,580
But how is the weekend
a last minute decision.

789
00:47:21,187 --> 00:47:22,070
Well, I don't know.

790
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:23,930
It just turned out that way.

791
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:26,190
But better late than never, right?

792
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:28,160
Heh, party on, Man.

793
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,600
So where ya hosting at?

794
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,850
My Aunt Brinke's condo.

795
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:37,670
Oh, the one with the little
beach point.

796
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:39,180
Yeah, that's it.

797
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,080
You been there?

798
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,220
Oh yeah, Brinke and I go way back.

799
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,350
Oh, very cool.

800
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:45,790
So it's a nice area?

801
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:46,800
Oh, it's the best.

802
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:49,923
Sweet.

803
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,710
She still got that crazy ass neighbor?

804
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,820
Yes, unfortunately.

805
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,370
Ah, it's too bad.

806
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:59,360
She's a real ball buster.

807
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,260
Wonder what her problem is?

808
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,700
Oh, like 15 years ago she was datin'

809
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,180
this college frat boy type.

810
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,430
He left.

811
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:09,210
She ain't never been the same since.

812
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:13,810
Yeah, she was a real cougar.

813
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:17,000
I even tried to get with her,

814
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,450
but I guess I'm not her type.

815
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,940
Whatever.

816
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,050
She couldn't land anybody
after that.

817
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:24,920
Not that year, not the year after.

818
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,000
Then she got this whole moral
authority bug up her ass,

819
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,010
and well, never been the same since.

820
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:31,843
Wait a second.

821
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,230
You're tellin' me if we
can just get her laid

822
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:37,880
by some college frat jock?

823
00:48:38,825 --> 00:48:41,250
Bow chica bow bow!

824
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:42,160
Right on, Dude.

825
00:48:43,631 --> 00:48:45,400
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

826
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,990
Oh, I think so.

827
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,930
Alright, that is 11.95.

828
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:58,460
There, keep it.

829
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:00,520
Whoa, seriously?

830
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,410
Yeah.

831
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:04,420
You told us exactly
what we needed to hear.

832
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,860
Awesome.

833
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,790
Thanks.

834
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:09,462
Hey, come on out tonight.

835
00:49:09,462 --> 00:49:10,597
Alright, Man.

836
00:49:10,597 --> 00:49:12,377
Boom, I'll be there.
See you tonight.

837
00:49:12,377 --> 00:49:13,864
Alright.

838
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:17,714
Yeah, party down.

839
00:49:37,164 --> 00:49:38,450
You know what?

840
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:41,520
I think I was too hard on
this film.

841
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:47,200
I think it has transcended
being a mere motion picture

842
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,590
and has emerged from it's
celluloid cocoon

843
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:54,870
as a full on sadomasochistic
social experiment.

844
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,610
What are you on about?

845
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:58,810
No, hear me out.

846
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:00,920
I'm not even doing a bit.

847
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,460
What kind of sex comedy would

848
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,090
provide so precious little sex?

849
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:09,270
There is more shopping than anything,

850
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:12,560
and more talking than
My Dinner With Andre,

851
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:17,560
and to finish it off,
a fully clothed shower scene.

852
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,600
And as for sex, not a single thrust.

853
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,150
Well played, Horndog's, well played.

854
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:28,320
You have tortured my subjects
to levels

855
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,920
of submission that I could
only imagine.

856
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,040
I have to admit, you aren't wrong.

857
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:36,910
Am I ever?

858
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:37,743
Remember when you

859
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,950
opened that strip club for cats?

860
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:42,090
Cat Nips?

861
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:43,450
That was genius idea.

862
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:46,510
Cat sexuality is untapped goldmine.

863
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,700
It devolved into a hissing,

864
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,400
spraying hell within seconds.

865
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,880
So it had a few kinks.

866
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,900
And who amongst us here doesn't?

867
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,410
Anyway, this movie has subjected

868
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:04,410
one and all to unholy levels
of torture.

869
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,530
I believe we are done here.

870
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:09,260
You are aware the film isn't
over, right?

871
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,093
Really?

872
00:51:10,093 --> 00:51:12,050
No, we haven't even seen that

873
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:14,350
party that they've
talked about incessantly.

874
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:16,980
I just assumed this was plot hole.

875
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:17,980
Plot hole?

876
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,730
It's the entire point of the story.

877
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:23,020
Have you seen the rest of the movie?

878
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:26,690
I would not be surprised
if the film makers

879
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,700
just forgot to finish it.

880
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,680
Another good point.

881
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,440
You know, you're on fire today.

882
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,190
Oh, speaking of fire.

883
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:47,780
I have been advised that the following

884
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:51,790
reel of tonight's film may
cause burning sensation

885
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:56,710
in the eyes and loss of
sensation in the genitalia.

886
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:00,410
These symptoms should persist
for only two to four days,

887
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:03,390
but if they continue
then you should contact

888
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:07,590
your primary care physician
or call 1-800-CROTCH-ROT.

889
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:11,980
Anyway, enough of that.

890
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:14,760
Here goes nothing.

891
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,720
Roll 'em, Boys!

892
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:20,680
You know, I think this
movie is the worst thing

893
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:25,680
that has ever happened to me,
and I grew up in Chernobyl.

894
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:53,266
Oh yeah.

895
00:52:55,846 --> 00:52:57,860
That was amazing.

896
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,810
You were awesome.

897
00:53:00,899 --> 00:53:02,940
I've been needing that so bad.

898
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,240
You're such a sweet guy.

899
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,440
When are your friends gonna
be here?

900
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,540
Um, in a little bit.

901
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,900
Maybe you should get dressed?

902
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,850
No, there's no rush.

903
00:53:18,955 --> 00:53:21,340
Hey, you girls need some waterin'?

904
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:22,173
Hey!

905
00:53:24,294 --> 00:53:26,280
This is gonna be the best one
yet, Dude.

906
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,113
Oh yeah, Bro.

907
00:53:27,113 --> 00:53:29,276
They are totally gonna have
to leave after this one.

908
00:53:29,276 --> 00:53:31,418
Totally, Dude.

909
00:53:38,204 --> 00:53:39,037
Jesus.

910
00:53:42,233 --> 00:53:44,300
Dude, what are they doing to you?

911
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,891
Oh my God, make it stop,
make it stop!

912
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,930
We've been told that you two
have been causing problems.

913
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:53,553
We're sorry, we're so sorry, Bro.

914
00:53:53,553 --> 00:53:54,386
Dude, really?

915
00:53:54,386 --> 00:53:57,300
Now, are you two gonna
apologize to the others?

916
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,280
Yes, yes, I promise I will.

917
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:01,023
Ew!

918
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:04,763
Ew!

919
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:08,595
What, what is it?

920
00:54:08,595 --> 00:54:12,066
Do you smell pickles?

921
00:54:12,066 --> 00:54:17,066
Yeah.

922
00:54:17,827 --> 00:54:19,990
Oh now, what do we have here?

923
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,100
A few more whores.

924
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,070
Alright you two, front door, now!

925
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:28,903
But...

926
00:54:28,903 --> 00:54:29,736
Now!

927
00:54:29,736 --> 00:54:30,569
Yes, Ma'am.

928
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:37,740
Get in!

929
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,270
Steph, hey!
Hey!

930
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:44,490
Hi!
Hey!

931
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:46,665
Brah, I'm sorry, Brah.

932
00:54:46,665 --> 00:54:48,180
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry.

933
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,210
Well.

934
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:50,080
Where's your bathroom, Bro?

935
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,670
Please, Brah?

936
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:53,517
Uh, right over there.

937
00:54:53,517 --> 00:54:58,517
Thanks, Brah.

938
00:55:16,732 --> 00:55:17,565
Oh God.

939
00:55:19,004 --> 00:55:21,171
Dude, that's just nasty.

940
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,393
Sorry, Dude.

941
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:31,330
Loren, come here.

942
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,960
So, Loren, this is Steph and Becky.

943
00:55:37,426 --> 00:55:38,259
Hi.
Hi.

944
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,620
Cute.
Yeah.

945
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,660
He is a cutie.

946
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:47,090
Yeah, he really is,
and he's such a sweetie,

947
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:49,937
and I mean he really is a sweetie.

948
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,066
Hey Girl!

949
00:55:58,066 --> 00:55:58,899
Nice to see you two!

950
00:56:02,561 --> 00:56:03,394
Hey!

951
00:56:04,732 --> 00:56:06,280
You guys need some help?

952
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,113
Yeah, absolutely.

953
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:07,946
Here, grab some

954
00:56:07,946 --> 00:56:08,779
Did you guys get booze?

955
00:56:08,779 --> 00:56:09,612
Duh!

956
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:11,820
Alright, that's what I'm
talkin' about!

957
00:56:13,528 --> 00:56:14,969
It's in the back.

958
00:56:14,969 --> 00:56:15,869
Hey, can I help?

959
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:19,543
It's cool.

960
00:56:20,704 --> 00:56:23,060
Uh, well alrighty then!

961
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,210
Alright.
Let's go.

962
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:27,860
Did you wash your car window off?

963
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,053
There.

964
00:56:38,727 --> 00:56:40,790
I think we have everything we need.

965
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:43,900
Everything except your
neighbor's permission.

966
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,950
That'll never happen.

967
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:47,650
Uh, not necessarily.

968
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:49,750
What do you mean?

969
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:53,020
Hmm, I think she has a
weakness for the young guys.

970
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,070
Well, she didn't seem to like
us at all.

971
00:56:57,070 --> 00:56:58,400
Apparently we're not her type.

972
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,138
Well what is her type, Dude?

973
00:57:02,138 --> 00:57:04,106
You guys, Dude.

974
00:57:04,106 --> 00:57:07,208
I think the other one.

975
00:57:25,504 --> 00:57:27,725
Bro, I'm really sorry about earlier.

976
00:57:27,725 --> 00:57:28,558
Oh man.

977
00:57:28,558 --> 00:57:29,410
We were acting like assholes.

978
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:30,270
It's cool, Man.

979
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:31,690
We're cool.

980
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:32,840
You okay, Dude?

981
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:33,673
Oh yeah, Brah.

982
00:57:33,673 --> 00:57:35,360
Actually, I feel pretty refreshed.

983
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:40,340
Hey, any of you two guys
into cougars by chance?

984
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:41,340
Not me, Dude.

985
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:43,160
I'm into 19 to 25 only.

986
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:49,790
Well, I know I am!

987
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:51,400
I'm totally into cougars, Man.

988
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,430
That's totally my bag, Man.

989
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:53,740
Why, you got something in mind?

990
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,340
Bitchy Brigitte next door.

991
00:57:57,256 --> 00:57:58,089
Yes.

992
00:57:58,089 --> 00:57:59,310
Oh, see, I told you.

993
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:00,970
I knew something awesome
was happening next door!

994
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:02,640
Hot cougar on the prowl, Brah!

995
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,100
To each his own.

996
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,420
Well, it's been a while
for this one, I think,

997
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,620
and this cougar is hungry.

998
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,510
Oh no, even better, Brah.

999
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:16,870
Well, if you really wanna
party tonight,

1000
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:18,250
you better get over there.

1001
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:25,380
Oh wow, this is good stuff.

1002
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:33,270
Oh my, well hello.

1003
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:34,120
Hello yourself.

1004
00:58:35,591 --> 00:58:37,641
Would you like to come in for
some tea?

1005
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:39,763
Yes, I would.

1006
00:58:42,177 --> 00:58:43,470
Do you smell pickles?

1007
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:48,530
Um, I love pickle, don't you?

1008
00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:50,890
Yes, so do I.

1009
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,110
He's in!

1010
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,160
Okay, we've got a lot to do.

It's already 5:15.

1047
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:29,950
The Horndog Beach Party starts
in less than two hours!

1048
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,540
Don't worry, it will work.

1049
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,170
In the meantime, would you
like to see my swimsuit?

1050
01:01:36,493 --> 01:01:37,493
Heck yeah.

1051
01:01:38,342 --> 01:01:39,470
Let's go.

1052
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:40,940
I got a new one, too.

1053
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,530
I can't wait to see it.

1054
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:44,676
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1055
01:01:44,676 --> 01:01:48,220
Yes, here's my swimsuit.

1056
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:49,070
Oh, that?

1057
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:51,580
I thought you were gonna
put it on or something?

1058
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:56,420
Well, don't you think it
looks great as it is right now.

1059
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:59,288
I mean, it's cute,
but I wanna see it on you!

1060
01:01:59,288 --> 01:02:00,288
Of course.

1061
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,070
Oh my gosh, what a tease.

1062
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:08,170
Hey, I need to change.

1063
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:09,480
Get out.

1064
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,410
Really?

1065
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:11,243
Yeah.

1066
01:02:11,243 --> 01:02:12,076
Already?

1067
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:12,909
Get out.
Really?

1068
01:02:12,909 --> 01:02:13,742
Yeah, get out.
Dude, what?

1069
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:18,173
Well?

1070
01:02:18,173 --> 01:02:20,220
Don't you need to?

1071
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:21,400
No.

1072
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,000
You can see it later, come on.

1073
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:33,080
You know, you're not
such a bad guy after all.

1074
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,727
Sometimes things just
get the better of me.

1075
01:02:37,727 --> 01:02:39,653
Get the better of us all.

1076
01:02:39,653 --> 01:02:44,117
Ooh, but good things
come to those who repent.

1077
01:02:44,117 --> 01:02:45,036
Oh yeah?

1078
01:02:45,036 --> 01:02:49,810
And you repent very well.

1079
01:02:57,064 --> 01:03:00,920
Dude, I don't know how
Tad's gonna pull that off.

1080
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,160
Brigitte really is a bitch, Dude.

1081
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,760
Bitchy Brigitte, I have no idea.

1082
01:03:05,932 --> 01:03:06,765
I hope he does.

1083
01:03:06,765 --> 01:03:08,510
We really need to have this party.

1084
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:10,840
What do you think, uh,
what do you

1085
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,310
think's gonna happen if he doesn't?

1086
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:14,950
Can we still have the party?
If he doesn't?

1087
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:20,680
We have to have this party.

1088
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:23,270
He has got to bang that out, now.

1089
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:25,320
Or I don't know what else
we're gonna do.

1090
01:03:26,768 --> 01:03:28,690
You think she'd call the cops
on us?

1091
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:29,790
She has in the past.

1092
01:03:32,831 --> 01:03:33,664
Yeah.

1093
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:38,603
I'm hoping he does.

1094
01:03:38,603 --> 01:03:40,030
I mean, this party,
we've been planning

1095
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:41,550
on coming here for a long time.

1096
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:42,730
The girls are down.

1097
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:45,072
What do you think's gonna happen?

1098
01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:47,080
We can't not have this party,

1099
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,030
so hopefully he just bangs
her out,

1100
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:51,590
comes back over here,
and we're set.

1101
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:53,500
I don't know what we're gonna do

1102
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:55,410
if we can't get her on board.

1103
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:57,330
You actually think he's
gonna be able to do it.

1104
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:58,163
I hope so.

1105
01:03:58,163 --> 01:03:59,750
I mean, I don't know.

1106
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:01,520
Cougars are crazy, Dude.

1107
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,750
I don't know.

1108
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:11,100
If it doesn't work out,
I'm still gonna have a party.

1109
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,900
I don't know what everyone
else is gonna be doing.

1110
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:14,900
Yeah, Man.

1111
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,090
Want something to drink.

1112
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:19,640
Yeah, I need a drink.

1113
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:27,173
Oh, wow, what a fantastic swimsuit!

1114
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,770
I just wanted to apologize for

1115
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,530
the way I've been acting lately.

1116
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,570
It hasn't been very lady like.

1117
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:38,130
It's okay.

1118
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:40,980
Well, the reason why I'm here is

1119
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:44,950
I heard that there's a beach
festival going on tonight

1120
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:49,210
and my new beau and I wanted
to see

1121
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:51,280
if you wanted to host a beach party?

1122
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,580
Really?

1123
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:56,022
Mhmm.

1124
01:04:56,022 --> 01:04:56,998
Don't we?

1125
01:04:56,998 --> 01:04:58,572
Mhmm.

1126
01:04:58,572 --> 01:05:03,400
Well, we've gotta go out and
find new swimsuits ourselves.

1127
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,460
Gotta keep my new cub looking fantastic.

1128
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,023
Thank you.

1129
01:05:10,023 --> 01:05:12,920
We'll see you tonight!

1130
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:13,980
Well?

1131
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:17,449
She wants us to host a party!

1132
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:20,982
Oh my God.

1133
01:05:20,982 --> 01:05:22,250
Oh, hey, hey, Everybody.

1134
01:05:22,250 --> 01:05:23,110
Guys, Guys, Guys, I need you.

1135
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:25,330
We only got like 20 minutes
to start setting up.

1136
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:28,098
So just grab whatever you can
and let's go out on the beach.

1137
01:05:28,098 --> 01:05:29,516
Alright, let's do it!

1138
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:43,853
Woohoo!

1139
01:05:43,853 --> 01:05:46,967
Yes, we did it!

1140
01:05:46,967 --> 01:05:49,060
Hey!

1141
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:52,160
I'd love to thank you for all
of you.

1142
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,150
At the beginning, I thought all

1143
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:57,050
I wanted is quiet in nice place,

1144
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:58,710
but I realized what I really need

1145
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:00,110
is you and a real good time!

1146
01:06:02,321 --> 01:06:04,153
So toast to all of you!

1147
01:06:06,602 --> 01:06:08,630
My old friends and new friends!

1148
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,340
I love you all!

1149
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:36,859
Hello!

1150
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:38,310
Hello Everybody, how's it going?

1151
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:39,360
Hello!
Hey!

1152
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,870
Say, who's in charge here?

1153
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:44,580
Hi, my name is Dusty,
what's your name?

1154
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,260
Why, I'm the legendary Horndog!

1155
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:53,750
Hey, thank you, thank you.

1156
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:57,360
Ladies and Gentleman,
after 15 long years,

1157
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,220
both sides of the beach have
been reunited

1158
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:02,447
by the lovely Horndog Queen, Dusty!

1159
01:07:07,042 --> 01:07:08,930
Thank you, My Queen, thank you.

1160
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,920
And I hope to see you all
again next year!

1161
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:13,416
Let's party, Everyone!

1162
01:10:25,919 --> 01:10:27,637
Oh, looking good, Brigitte.

1163
01:10:27,637 --> 01:10:28,648
Oh, thank you.

1164
01:10:28,648 --> 01:10:30,830
Wow, what a great party!

1165
01:10:30,830 --> 01:10:31,663
Thank you.

1166
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:34,940
Looking good, Dude!

1167
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:35,840
Oh, thanks, Bro.

1168
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:37,733
What was that?

1169
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:40,340
Oh, um, I'm sorry.

1170
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,860
Thank you, Brad.

1171
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:44,090
There, that's better.

1172
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,270
You gotta teach these cubs early

1173
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:50,560
or they'll run right over you.

1174
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:58,731
So, what happens after this weekend?

1175
01:10:58,731 --> 01:11:02,940
I don't know, and I honestly
don't wanna think about it.

1176
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:07,940
I'm just enjoying this
perfect weekend.

1177
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,058
So did you really mean that?

1178
01:11:13,058 --> 01:11:14,066
What?

1179
01:11:14,066 --> 01:11:16,280
About coming back here next year?

1180
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,127
Hmm, it depends.

1181
01:11:18,127 --> 01:11:20,610
Are you coming with me?

1182
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:25,610
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

1183
01:11:27,506 --> 01:11:30,524
Woo!

1184
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:10,200
You know what?

1185
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,550
I thought this movie
had reached it's height

1186
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:16,420
with the fully clothed shower scene,

1187
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:21,170
but the sex scene with the door?

1188
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:25,620
The whole goddamn screen was
just a door!

1189
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:29,150
Not too mention the reuse
of that hilarious gag

1190
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:32,310
from the gross out diarrhea scene.

1191
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:37,310
You idiots must have indigo
orbs the size of Venus by now!

1192
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:39,890
At least we got our party!

1193
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:44,890
Proving yet again that
you have no social life.

1194
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:49,570
You call that a party?

1195
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:51,610
There were people gathered and..

1196
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:53,870
And there was nothing!

1197
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,670
There was some babes and some boobs,

1198
01:12:56,670 --> 01:13:00,490
and I mean idiots,
I don't mean tits.

1199
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:03,990
And they were sitting
at a table and nothing.

1200
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:05,730
Well, there was..

1201
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:07,910
There was people at a table,

1202
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:10,690
stock footage not withstanding.

1203
01:13:10,690 --> 01:13:11,670
That's not a party.

1204
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:14,990
That was a casual get
together at best.

1205
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:16,520
But, it was implied

1206
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:19,710
that there were alcoholic
beverages and snacks.

1207
01:13:19,710 --> 01:13:23,770
The whole damn party was implied.

1208
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:25,390
But Horndog said Dusty

1209
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:28,740
saved the day by reunited
the two sides of the beach.

1210
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:30,480
That's a real crowd pleaser, right?

1211
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:33,150
Dusty did not do jack shit!

1212
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:35,570
That dude bro wanged the coug
and that's

1213
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:37,600
the whole reason the party
took place!

1214
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:44,110
Oh, my faithful lap dogs are
still here.

1215
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,260
What do you want?

1216
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,290
Haven't you had enough
torture for one week?

1217
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:53,370
Maybe you should throw them a bone.

1218
01:13:53,370 --> 01:13:56,020
You know, under normal circumstances

1219
01:13:56,020 --> 01:13:59,350
I would tell you to shut
your stupid cake hole,

1220
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:03,770
but I think considering
these circumstances,

1221
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:05,650
I would have to agree.

1222
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:07,390
Here, take these.

1223
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:42,191
There, satisfied now?

1224
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:45,500
Well, too tough.

1225
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:48,190
You will take it and you will
like it.

1226
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:50,194
That's it for us this week.

1227
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:55,080
You know, normally for
that little outburst

1228
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:59,310
I would promise that next week
I make you suffer even more,

1229
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:02,280
but I don't think after a
movie like that

1230
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,560
I can make good on the promise.

1231
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,490
So I will paraphrase my G
randpa de Sade

1232
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:13,400
and say,
it is by way of cinematic pain

1233
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,330
that we arrive at pleasure.

1234
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:20,290
Or was it,
rock out with your cock out?

1235
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:23,590
Either way,
whatever works best for you.

1236
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:24,780
Roll credits.

1237
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:26,263
I'm out this bitch!

1238
01:18:24,424 --> 01:18:25,886
Ain't nobody here!

1239
01:18:25,886 --> 01:18:27,769
Well, did we?

1240
01:18:27,769 --> 01:18:30,102
Oh man, we missed the party.

1241
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:34,133
I told you we should
have taken a ride share.

1242
01:18:34,133 --> 01:18:35,487
Oh man.

1243
01:18:35,487 --> 01:18:37,570
What are we gonna do now?

1244
01:18:38,820 --> 01:18:41,650
Well, we could have a little
beach party

1245
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,000
of our own, little horndog.

1246
01:18:44,239 --> 01:18:46,770
Ooh, bow chica bow bow.

1247
01:18:51,285 --> 01:18:55,118
What did that even
have to do with anything?

1248
01:18:58,430 --> 01:18:59,330
Give me that back!
