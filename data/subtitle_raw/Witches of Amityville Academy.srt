2
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:49,179
Come on, you witch. Come on!

3
00:00:49,213 --> 00:00:53,215
- Gonna burn you!
- Get a move on!

4
00:00:53,217 --> 00:00:56,052
- You've been betrayed!
- Stop flirting!

5
00:00:56,086 --> 00:00:57,752
Death forwards!

6
00:00:57,754 --> 00:00:58,555
Now!

7
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:07,295
You dirty witch!

8
00:01:20,944 --> 00:01:21,778
Mercy!

9
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:24,112
Mercy!

10
00:02:20,304 --> 00:02:22,138
You sure this is the place?

11
00:02:22,172 --> 00:02:23,538
Tom was doing some work here.

12
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,542
He said he saw three
women living along.

13
00:02:26,443 --> 00:02:28,376
Said there's a safe in there.

14
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:30,880
Rumor in town is they
got a lot of money.

15
00:02:34,083 --> 00:02:35,585
All right, I'm in.

16
00:02:36,753 --> 00:02:37,921
Okay, we go in quiet.

17
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:40,422
We try not to wake anyone.

18
00:02:40,424 --> 00:02:41,425
Be a lot easier.

19
00:02:42,326 --> 00:02:43,159
Ready?

20
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:46,330
Oh, I'm ready.

21
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:48,164
Let's get rich.

22
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:50,500
Let's do it.

23
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:26,035
Quiet.

24
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:27,136
Check upstairs.

25
00:04:51,087 --> 00:04:53,423
What are you doing?

26
00:04:56,192 --> 00:04:58,194
Where the hell
did you come from?

27
00:04:58,261 --> 00:04:59,929
This is my house.

28
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:02,296
Please.

29
00:05:02,298 --> 00:05:03,132
Shh.

30
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,801
Shut up.

31
00:05:55,585 --> 00:05:58,586
Now tell me, where is the safe?

32
00:05:58,588 --> 00:06:00,123
We don't have a safe.

33
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:06,362
Please, just leave us alone
or we'll be forced to act.

34
00:06:07,263 --> 00:06:08,264
And I don't want to hurt you.

35
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:12,233
You brought this on yourself.

36
00:06:12,235 --> 00:06:13,535
Where is the safe?!

37
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:15,338
We don't have a safe!

38
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,946
What the fuck?

39
00:06:24,948 --> 00:06:26,182
Don't touch that.

40
00:06:30,086 --> 00:06:31,719
Where's the money?

41
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:32,654
Money?

42
00:06:32,656 --> 00:06:33,923
In the safe, the money!

43
00:06:56,112 --> 00:06:59,215
Now, that wasn't
very nice, was it?

44
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,794
What are we going
to do with him?

45
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:48,698
I say, let him go.

46
00:07:48,765 --> 00:07:52,233
We wipe his memory
and we change his ways

47
00:07:52,235 --> 00:07:54,638
with the power of suggestion.

48
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,552
Well, that went rather nicely.

49
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:10,887
Can I keep him?

50
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:13,623
We could use the Butler.

51
00:08:21,464 --> 00:08:22,298
What?

52
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:26,169
Jesus.

53
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:45,953
It felt good to use my
powers like that again.

54
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:47,991
Well, you know we can't, Sam.

55
00:08:48,057 --> 00:08:50,259
We've gotta stay to ourselves.

56
00:08:50,293 --> 00:08:52,293
Besides, you know humans.

57
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:54,528
They'll never accept witches.

58
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:57,832
We'll either end up
hung by a gallow pole

59
00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:59,803
or burned at the stake.

60
00:08:59,836 --> 00:09:03,004
So why do we keep watching
Dominique and her coven

61
00:09:03,006 --> 00:09:04,407
if we're not gonna intervene?

62
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:06,407
I think Lucy's right.

63
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:08,277
We can't bring
attention to ourselves.

64
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:11,579
We have a responsibility.

65
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:14,081
We just need to
keep our eyes open,

66
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,153
and hopefully we don't
have to use our powers.

67
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,622
All I know is there's nothing
like a good chardonnay.

68
00:09:20,624 --> 00:09:21,725
Cheers, girls.

69
00:09:24,093 --> 00:09:25,528
Come on, drag her this way.

70
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:31,567
Be quick, the poison
will wear off soon.

71
00:09:31,635 --> 00:09:32,802
My arms are weakening!

72
00:09:39,242 --> 00:09:41,577
Come on, stop your
screaming, witch!

73
00:09:45,749 --> 00:09:48,952
You all
right back there?

74
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:49,817
Yeah.

75
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:50,654
I'm fine.

76
00:09:53,623 --> 00:09:54,891
Just a nightmare.

77
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:03,264
So what are you doing
at the Academy, anyway,

78
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:04,734
if you don't mind me asking?

79
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:10,539
I am here for induction.

80
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:11,975
I was offered a place.

81
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:15,044
Do you know much about it?

82
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:16,612
It has a good reputation.

83
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,614
No, I've
not heard anything.

84
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:43,639
Why are we pulling...

85
00:10:43,673 --> 00:10:45,239
Are we here?

86
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:48,611
Yeah, there's just
like potholes and stuff.

87
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:50,044
Really don't want
to ruin my tires.

88
00:10:50,046 --> 00:10:51,547
So yeah, this is it.

89
00:10:52,716 --> 00:10:54,515
So how do I get in?

90
00:10:54,517 --> 00:10:56,117
Just, you know,
head into the forest.

91
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:58,252
Five minutes and the
Academy's on your left.

92
00:10:58,254 --> 00:10:58,988
Can't miss it.

93
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:22,966
Hello?

94
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:35,342
Oh, hey.

95
00:13:35,344 --> 00:13:36,911
- I'm-
- Jessica.

96
00:13:36,913 --> 00:13:39,248
- Yeah.
- I'm Katherine.

97
00:13:39,282 --> 00:13:40,416
I'll show you around.

98
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:43,584
Were you surprised
to get your invite

99
00:13:43,586 --> 00:13:44,986
to the Amityville Academy?

100
00:13:44,988 --> 00:13:47,123
Yeah, because I
never actually applied.

101
00:13:48,424 --> 00:13:50,659
Well, Ms. Marcom
always seeks the best.

102
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,260
What will you study here?

103
00:13:53,262 --> 00:13:54,795
Drama and the arts.

104
00:13:54,797 --> 00:13:56,199
Cool.

105
00:13:56,265 --> 00:13:57,100
Me too.

106
00:14:02,371 --> 00:14:04,207
I'll give you some advice now.

107
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,709
Never questioned Ms.
Marcom's methods.

108
00:14:07,944 --> 00:14:10,279
This is Ms. Marcom's office.

109
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:12,215
Knock, and then
enter on her command.

110
00:14:13,616 --> 00:14:15,451
After your induction, I'll
take you to your room.

111
00:14:48,484 --> 00:14:51,487
We've been watching
you some time.

112
00:14:56,926 --> 00:14:57,760
Sit.

113
00:15:06,635 --> 00:15:09,138
We almost exclusively
offer places

114
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:12,008
to students of your background.

115
00:15:13,676 --> 00:15:14,543
My background?

116
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:25,955
This building is beautiful.

117
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:27,756
The location is perfect.

118
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:33,496
It allows seclusion, privacy,
and minimal distractions.

119
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:39,066
You've come late to semester.

120
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:42,805
You have a lot to learn in
a very short space of time.

121
00:15:42,838 --> 00:15:44,807
This is the contract.

122
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:50,846
Once you've signed
this, you'll be ours

123
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:53,247
for the foreseeable future.

124
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:54,683
Until graduation, you mean.

125
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:57,920
As you wish.

126
00:16:06,662 --> 00:16:11,167
I'm not sure I know
enough about the school.

127
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,369
I told you, there
is not much time.

128
00:16:14,837 --> 00:16:17,506
You must be willing to
learn, and learn quickly.

129
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:22,945
We will teach you here,
but you must open yourself.

130
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,883
Besides, what else
have you to do?

131
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:31,654
You lead a rather sad existence.

132
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:34,790
Friendless, alone.

133
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,027
Have you not always
wondered why?

134
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:42,296
There is no choice to make.

135
00:16:42,298 --> 00:16:44,867
Sign and belong to something.

136
00:16:46,302 --> 00:16:48,871
Something that will promise
greatness in this life.

137
00:17:09,392 --> 00:17:10,193
Excellent.

138
00:17:11,694 --> 00:17:12,861
Perhaps a toast?

139
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:22,671
Wait.

140
00:17:23,706 --> 00:17:24,640
It's getting kind of late.

141
00:17:24,673 --> 00:17:26,175
I should probably go to my room.

142
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,544
Very well.

143
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:33,516
Thank you, Ms. Marcom.

144
00:17:40,323 --> 00:17:42,158
Welcome to the Academy.

145
00:18:20,129 --> 00:18:23,797
What did you
think of Ms. Marcom?

146
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:25,201
She's a brilliant woman.

147
00:18:26,735 --> 00:18:28,003
I'm sure she is.

148
00:18:29,972 --> 00:18:31,140
Did she tell you much?

149
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,741
She was quite vague.

150
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:37,578
I'm sure you'll find
out more tomorrow.

151
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,414
Good night.

152
00:18:41,617 --> 00:18:42,451
Yeah.

153
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:44,320
Good night.

154
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:16,750
She's new as well.

155
00:19:16,752 --> 00:19:18,987
I'll leave you two
to get acquainted.

156
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:24,927
Hi!

157
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,194
Sorry, I'm not sure if
this is my room or not.

158
00:19:27,196 --> 00:19:28,264
She didn't...

159
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:29,796
Oh, don't worry.

160
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:31,898
Come hang out till you find out.

161
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,369
- Hi, I'm Sally.
- Jessica.

162
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:35,738
I didn't even
apply to join here.

163
00:19:35,804 --> 00:19:37,306
I just got offered a place.

164
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,173
Yeah, same.

165
00:19:39,342 --> 00:19:41,744
You didn't know much
about here, why come?

166
00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:48,048
I guess I was just
trying to work out

167
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,385
what to do next, you know?

168
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:51,420
Maybe this is my calling.

169
00:19:51,454 --> 00:19:53,254
I got thrown out
of my last college.

170
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:55,491
No one else would take
me, and then Ms. Marcom

171
00:19:55,558 --> 00:19:56,592
offered me a place.

172
00:20:01,997 --> 00:20:03,666
Hey, are you okay.

173
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:07,536
Yeah, I'm fine, it was
that wine Ms. Marcom gave me.

174
00:20:09,805 --> 00:20:10,806
It's quite strong.

175
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,742
Oh, okay, sit down.

176
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:16,277
- So sorry.
- No, don't be silly.

177
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,112
Totally okay.

178
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,251
Here, have some of this.

179
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:23,116
Thanks.

180
00:20:23,118 --> 00:20:24,453
No, it's totally okay.

181
00:20:26,922 --> 00:20:28,121
I'm so sorry, I just...

182
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:31,126
No no, it happens
to the best of us.

183
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:33,556
Well, is it confirmed?

184
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,758
She bears the mark.

185
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:38,694
- Where was it placed?
- Her back.

186
00:21:39,828 --> 00:21:41,995
The mark had three
horns instead of two.

187
00:21:41,997 --> 00:21:43,532
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

188
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:50,138
What does it mean?

189
00:21:51,674 --> 00:21:52,475
Be gone.

190
00:21:53,776 --> 00:21:55,277
Prepare the hall and the coven,

191
00:21:56,278 --> 00:21:57,746
and bring the new girls to me.

192
00:21:59,848 --> 00:22:01,016
As you wish, Madame.

193
00:23:17,593 --> 00:23:19,161
What is going on?

194
00:23:56,198 --> 00:23:57,032
Stop it!

195
00:24:09,044 --> 00:24:12,881
So, we have a
volunteer to go first.

196
00:24:17,052 --> 00:24:18,153
You will be next.

197
00:24:30,032 --> 00:24:31,166
The chalice.

198
00:24:39,174 --> 00:24:44,179
When the sacred blood is
spilt, the gates will open.

199
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,412
He will rise.

200
00:24:46,414 --> 00:24:48,917
And those
who burnt us alive

201
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:50,719
will meet their demise.

202
00:24:50,753 --> 00:24:52,619
He will rise.

203
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:56,959
And those who burnt us alive
will meet their demise.

204
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:03,766
Oh great Bortis, demon of
dark, accept this sacrifice

205
00:25:07,135 --> 00:25:09,638
in return for your
promise to bring forth

206
00:25:09,672 --> 00:25:11,740
your legion for my command.

207
00:25:13,742 --> 00:25:14,743
Take this soul.

208
00:25:17,445 --> 00:25:19,381
And allow me the blood!

209
00:26:05,127 --> 00:26:06,795
Now for you, Jessica.

210
00:26:08,931 --> 00:26:12,132
You bear the mark of the
the three-horned beast.

211
00:26:12,134 --> 00:26:16,204
The power that lies
within, you have no idea!

212
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:29,752
Get her!

213
00:27:03,418 --> 00:27:04,219
Boo.

214
00:28:45,754 --> 00:28:46,789
Get to the car, go.

215
00:28:51,326 --> 00:28:52,160
Hurry!

216
00:29:09,878 --> 00:29:10,712
Push!

217
00:29:30,866 --> 00:29:32,200
Come on, get in.

218
00:29:54,756 --> 00:29:55,723
We failed you.

219
00:29:57,492 --> 00:29:58,593
I'm sorry, Ms. Marcom.

220
00:29:59,828 --> 00:30:01,964
Apologies are for
the weak, Katherine.

221
00:30:12,174 --> 00:30:15,708
I'm sorry!

222
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,544
Please!

223
00:30:19,447 --> 00:30:20,282
Please!

224
00:30:26,088 --> 00:30:26,922
Please!

225
00:30:28,123 --> 00:30:28,957
Please!

226
00:30:32,327 --> 00:30:35,663
Fail me again, and I
will pull your heart out

227
00:30:35,697 --> 00:30:37,032
and feed it to the maggots.

228
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:05,593
How is she?

229
00:31:06,628 --> 00:31:07,693
She's okay.

230
00:31:07,695 --> 00:31:09,697
I gave her a sleeping spell.

231
00:31:09,764 --> 00:31:11,266
She needs to relax.

232
00:31:13,368 --> 00:31:15,537
So just what are we
gonna tell this girl?

233
00:31:16,371 --> 00:31:17,205
I don't know.

234
00:31:19,007 --> 00:31:20,540
The truth?

235
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:23,578
It's only fair she
understands the power she has.

236
00:31:25,613 --> 00:31:27,547
What about Dominique?

237
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:29,551
We can't interfere too much.

238
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:31,417
Not until we know what.

239
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:33,956
We took a big risk
helping this girl.

240
00:31:33,989 --> 00:31:35,588
I'll study the ancient texts.

241
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:38,860
Maybe that'll shed some light
onto what Dominique's plan is.

242
00:31:38,927 --> 00:31:42,295
But she's building up to
something, I can feel it.

243
00:32:04,086 --> 00:32:04,786
It's her!

244
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:13,126
Where am I?

245
00:32:13,128 --> 00:32:14,429
- Who are you?
- It's okay.

246
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:17,465
What's your name?

247
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,068
Jessica.

248
00:32:20,135 --> 00:32:22,004
Jessica, we're
here to help you.

249
00:32:23,738 --> 00:32:24,572
Don't worry.

250
00:32:31,713 --> 00:32:33,281
Is it Ms. Marcom?

251
00:32:33,348 --> 00:32:37,385
Yes, but we're protected
here by boundaries.

252
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:38,251
Protected by what?

253
00:32:38,253 --> 00:32:40,120
She's trying to kill me!

254
00:32:40,122 --> 00:32:40,955
Relax.

255
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,658
Sleep.

256
00:32:43,725 --> 00:32:45,093
Sleep, Jessica.

257
00:32:54,002 --> 00:32:55,337
She's getting stronger.

258
00:32:58,173 --> 00:33:00,406
We have to intensify
our protection spell

259
00:33:00,408 --> 00:33:02,708
to keep her off the property.

260
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,511
I agree.

261
00:33:05,113 --> 00:33:06,214
Yeah, no shit.

262
00:35:26,921 --> 00:35:30,158
We do need to decide
what to do with Jessica.

263
00:35:30,225 --> 00:35:32,192
She's our responsibility now.

264
00:35:32,194 --> 00:35:33,459
I know.

265
00:35:33,461 --> 00:35:35,263
We have to tell
Jessica the truth.

266
00:35:35,297 --> 00:35:36,596
But if we tell her the truth,

267
00:35:36,598 --> 00:35:39,199
it's our duty to
teach her our ways.

268
00:35:39,201 --> 00:35:41,167
We're gonna have
to prepare Jessica

269
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:43,905
for whatever might arise.

270
00:35:43,971 --> 00:35:47,473
Yes, we can all feel it.

271
00:35:47,475 --> 00:35:50,412
Dominique's coven is
gaining power every day.

272
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,283
And we have to
tell her the truth.

273
00:35:57,118 --> 00:35:57,952
Tell me what?

274
00:36:10,097 --> 00:36:11,797
Who are you?

275
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:16,137
We are all members of
a white witch bloodline.

276
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:21,175
I'm a Lucy Belle, and these
are my sisters, Sam and Elena.

277
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:25,545
Witches?

278
00:36:25,547 --> 00:36:28,383
We study for enlightenment
and healing and good.

279
00:36:29,651 --> 00:36:30,785
Not like Dominique.

280
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:34,489
She's a mistress
of the dark arts.

281
00:36:34,556 --> 00:36:36,391
But why did she
want to kill me?

282
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:39,158
You're part of our bloodline.

283
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,661
Within our lineage,
somewhere in our DNA,

284
00:36:41,663 --> 00:36:45,600
there lurks a power that
she wants to sacrifice

285
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:47,302
to increase her own.

286
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:48,701
Botis?

287
00:36:48,703 --> 00:36:49,871
She told you this?

288
00:36:52,206 --> 00:36:55,207
It was the name of the demon
that she was chanting for

289
00:36:55,209 --> 00:36:58,713
when she killed a
pupil at the Academy.

290
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:04,286
She said I had the
three-horned mark?

291
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:14,596
What does this mean?

292
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:17,297
Dominique wants Jessica.

293
00:37:17,299 --> 00:37:22,304
Her potential, her
power, her life force.

294
00:37:23,671 --> 00:37:25,907
It could be greater than
all three of ours combined.

295
00:37:25,973 --> 00:37:26,974
My power.

296
00:37:28,242 --> 00:37:29,511
You're a witch!

297
00:37:32,246 --> 00:37:33,848
You've never felt your power?

298
00:37:34,782 --> 00:37:36,451
Felt different?

299
00:37:38,252 --> 00:37:42,288
Sometimes I have
these strange nightmares

300
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,459
of being burned at a stake.

301
00:37:44,492 --> 00:37:46,160
Those aren't nightmares.

302
00:37:46,193 --> 00:37:50,131
Those are residual
memories of a past life.

303
00:37:54,902 --> 00:37:55,903
What happens now?

304
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,570
What can I do?

305
00:37:57,572 --> 00:37:59,739
We'll train you, Jessica.

306
00:37:59,741 --> 00:38:01,707
You need to learn our ways.

307
00:38:01,709 --> 00:38:04,546
And how to harness
your natural gifts.

308
00:38:05,747 --> 00:38:07,246
We'll protect you.

309
00:38:07,248 --> 00:38:08,550
We've got your back.

310
00:38:28,503 --> 00:38:29,804
What are you guys doing?

311
00:38:31,138 --> 00:38:31,973
Come in.

312
00:38:33,741 --> 00:38:34,876
Do you trust us?

313
00:38:36,878 --> 00:38:38,110
Yeah?

314
00:38:38,112 --> 00:38:39,614
Because for what
we're about to do,

315
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:41,749
you need to open your
heart and let us in.

316
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:47,088
A sisterhood of power
is based on trust.

317
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:49,256
Love.

318
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:52,592
And light.

319
00:38:52,594 --> 00:38:53,628
Is your heart open?

320
00:38:54,796 --> 00:38:55,797
Sure, yeah.

321
00:38:56,764 --> 00:38:57,599
Okay.

322
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,637
Blessed goddess
of love and light,

323
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,539
guide us on this moonlit night.

324
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,510
Fill our hearts
with energy bright

325
00:39:08,543 --> 00:39:11,212
and give her righteous
strength to fight.

326
00:39:12,213 --> 00:39:16,482
Earth, fire, life, and death.

327
00:39:16,484 --> 00:39:19,487
Blessed goddess
of love and light.

328
00:39:19,554 --> 00:39:22,321
guide us on this moonlit night.

329
00:39:22,323 --> 00:39:24,657
Fill our hearts
with energy bright

330
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:27,495
and give her a righteous
strength to fight.

331
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:30,297
Earth, fire, life, and death.

332
00:39:31,966 --> 00:39:34,636
Blessed goddess
of love and light,

333
00:39:34,669 --> 00:39:37,302
guide us on this moonlit night.

334
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,450
Guide us on this
move at night.

335
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:51,250
Blessed goddess
of love and light,

336
00:39:51,252 --> 00:39:54,155
guide us on this moonlit night.

337
00:40:24,552 --> 00:40:27,254
What do
you have to give?

338
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:32,359
Speak.

339
00:40:34,996 --> 00:40:36,197
From your heart.

340
00:40:57,084 --> 00:40:58,553
Clear your mind.

341
00:41:00,955 --> 00:41:01,956
This is crazy.

342
00:41:04,892 --> 00:41:09,096
Look inside and
see what you want to give.

343
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:09,964
Okay.

344
00:41:11,265 --> 00:41:12,433
Don't be afraid.

345
00:41:15,002 --> 00:41:15,870
You're safe.

346
00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:28,583
Clear your mind.

347
00:41:36,958 --> 00:41:37,892
Stay calm.

348
00:41:45,867 --> 00:41:47,669
Clear your mind.

349
00:42:05,753 --> 00:42:08,422
You let go of your fear
and found your power.

350
00:42:11,425 --> 00:42:13,294
Jessica, you have the gift.

351
00:42:14,261 --> 00:42:15,961
No freaking way.

352
00:42:52,934 --> 00:42:54,366
Ms. Marcom?

353
00:42:54,368 --> 00:42:56,037
Ms. Chloe Argento is here.

354
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:56,902
Should I get her?

355
00:42:56,904 --> 00:42:58,170
No!

356
00:42:58,172 --> 00:42:59,674
No one go near her.

357
00:43:01,175 --> 00:43:03,242
You may return to
your domiciles.

358
00:43:03,244 --> 00:43:04,846
I will welcome her myself.

359
00:43:11,085 --> 00:43:11,919
Hello?

360
00:43:23,464 --> 00:43:24,298
Hello?

361
00:45:09,003 --> 00:45:09,837
let me go.

362
00:45:24,718 --> 00:45:25,920
No, please, no!

363
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:32,659
No, no, please, no!

364
00:45:49,076 --> 00:45:51,078
These spell and
potion recipes?

365
00:45:51,112 --> 00:45:54,713
They're all for healing
and enlightenment.

366
00:45:54,715 --> 00:45:56,383
Our magic is always for good.

367
00:45:58,485 --> 00:45:59,787
Or for defense.

368
00:46:03,424 --> 00:46:05,259
I think you're gonna
really like some of these.

369
00:46:05,292 --> 00:46:06,125
Yeah?

370
00:46:06,127 --> 00:46:07,292
Mm-hmm.

371
00:46:07,294 --> 00:46:08,662
Which one's your favorite?

372
00:46:11,498 --> 00:46:13,833
I think I like this one.

373
00:46:13,835 --> 00:46:14,836
How come?

374
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:17,071
It's for enhancing energy.

375
00:46:17,138 --> 00:46:17,972
Yeah.

376
00:46:24,378 --> 00:46:29,383
What is it, Elena?

377
00:46:37,491 --> 00:46:39,193
She's taken another one.

378
00:47:09,924 --> 00:47:11,458
Give me power, Botis.

379
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:25,039
This is my offering to you.

380
00:47:27,741 --> 00:47:28,842
Give me more.

381
00:47:29,911 --> 00:47:30,744
More!

382
00:47:54,401 --> 00:47:57,071
We are close to releasing Botis.

383
00:47:58,906 --> 00:48:00,074
I can feel him.

384
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:05,046
Ready yourselves and the others.

385
00:48:06,247 --> 00:48:07,915
We will retrieve
Jessica tomorrow.

386
00:48:10,051 --> 00:48:14,555
If I give her to Botis,
he will obey my commands

387
00:48:14,588 --> 00:48:15,456
in this realm.

388
00:49:10,511 --> 00:49:12,013
What's going on?

389
00:49:13,747 --> 00:49:15,016
It's Dominique.

390
00:49:32,433 --> 00:49:34,068
She's trying to
break the barrier.

391
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:37,471
Keep strong.

392
00:49:41,042 --> 00:49:42,009
Hold on tight

393
00:49:48,249 --> 00:49:49,416
Focus.

394
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:08,402
I don't know how
long I can hold this.

395
00:50:37,131 --> 00:50:39,533
I don't know how much longer.

396
00:51:35,789 --> 00:51:38,058
I felt that power again.

397
00:51:38,091 --> 00:51:41,092
I'm not sure where it came
from and I had no control,

398
00:51:41,094 --> 00:51:43,930
but it felt like...

399
00:51:45,299 --> 00:51:46,631
Instinct?

400
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:47,468
Mm-hmm.

401
00:51:48,969 --> 00:51:51,037
The more you train, the
more power you'll gain.

402
00:51:53,674 --> 00:51:56,543
But I have a feeling
we're running out of time.

403
00:51:56,577 --> 00:51:59,244
And we don't know what
she's doing with Botis.

404
00:51:59,246 --> 00:52:01,915
We've never read
the demonic texts.

405
00:52:01,948 --> 00:52:04,749
The words within,
written in blood?

406
00:52:04,751 --> 00:52:08,322
And have the power to
compel those who read them.

407
00:52:08,389 --> 00:52:11,490
And you know, someone
with your potential

408
00:52:11,492 --> 00:52:14,695
would have been a great
ally for Dominique.

409
00:52:14,761 --> 00:52:16,430
So why does she
want to kill me?

410
00:52:20,201 --> 00:52:22,236
The elder will
know what to do.

411
00:52:22,303 --> 00:52:25,136
But we don't know how
much sanity she has left.

412
00:52:25,138 --> 00:52:26,973
She won't see us.

413
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,740
Well, she might see Jessica.

414
00:52:28,742 --> 00:52:30,074
Hey, who is the elder?

415
00:52:30,076 --> 00:52:33,347
She's our old teacher,
Tilda Von Erich.

416
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:35,747
Nobody really knows
how old she is.

417
00:52:35,749 --> 00:52:38,583
But she's read all
the demonic texts.

418
00:52:38,585 --> 00:52:41,622
But she's remained immune
to the dark powers.

419
00:52:41,655 --> 00:52:44,325
She'll know what
Dominique is up to.

420
00:52:44,391 --> 00:52:46,360
But it won't be easy.

421
00:52:46,427 --> 00:52:49,430
She still retains power,
but Dominique banished her

422
00:52:49,463 --> 00:52:53,632
outside of Amityville and
warned her not to intervene.

423
00:52:53,634 --> 00:52:56,637
If you're willing, we will try.

424
00:52:57,738 --> 00:52:58,505
Sounds good.

425
00:52:59,673 --> 00:53:01,206
I'll watch the Academy
and just make sure

426
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:02,909
nobody tracks you.

427
00:53:02,943 --> 00:53:04,077
Okay.

428
00:53:55,296 --> 00:53:56,096
Tilda?

429
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:01,468
Tilda?

430
00:54:27,761 --> 00:54:29,262
Jessica.

431
00:54:31,131 --> 00:54:32,699
Go to the cauldron.

432
00:54:49,616 --> 00:54:51,282
What is she doing?

433
00:54:51,284 --> 00:54:52,886
She's in a trance.

434
00:54:58,459 --> 00:54:59,793
Drink.

435
00:55:14,007 --> 00:55:14,841
Drink.

436
00:55:17,378 --> 00:55:18,879
It's good for you.

437
00:55:30,323 --> 00:55:31,291
Don't drink that.

438
00:55:41,234 --> 00:55:44,337
The taste
is wretched, yes?

439
00:55:45,171 --> 00:55:46,740
It helps you focus.

440
00:55:52,879 --> 00:55:54,047
Bring me some.

441
00:55:57,551 --> 00:56:01,586
Tilda?

442
00:56:01,588 --> 00:56:02,423
Tilda?

443
00:56:10,296 --> 00:56:11,665
Continue by yourself.

444
00:56:15,536 --> 00:56:16,870
You're on your own.

445
00:56:38,659 --> 00:56:39,824
Lenora.

446
00:57:33,113 --> 00:57:34,748
- Tilda.
- Silence.

447
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:38,318
I want to speak with the girl.

448
00:57:44,758 --> 00:57:45,592
The book.

449
00:57:48,028 --> 00:57:48,862
The book?

450
00:57:50,497 --> 00:57:51,832
- This one?
- Mm-hmm.

451
00:57:55,536 --> 00:57:59,706
It is like a family
tree, I guess.

452
00:58:02,042 --> 00:58:04,244
The entries are chronological.

453
00:58:07,447 --> 00:58:08,749
You'll find Leonore Belle.

454
00:58:10,216 --> 00:58:12,819
1568 to 1599.

455
00:58:17,423 --> 00:58:22,028
You died on New Year's
Eve during a blood moon.

456
00:58:23,496 --> 00:58:28,334
They burned and hung women
without prejudice or due process.

457
00:58:32,839 --> 00:58:33,707
That's horrible.

458
00:58:35,876 --> 00:58:36,710
Oh.

459
00:58:41,948 --> 00:58:43,249
She looks just like me.

460
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:51,122
You are one and the same.

461
00:58:51,124 --> 00:58:52,959
Will I ever
remember everything?

462
00:58:55,461 --> 00:58:57,130
It is not likely.

463
00:59:00,166 --> 00:59:04,671
Besides, life is best
lived looking ahead.

464
00:59:20,721 --> 00:59:21,788
You have great power.

465
00:59:22,989 --> 00:59:25,158
Greater even than in
your previous life.

466
00:59:29,696 --> 00:59:33,634
The Belles all bear the mark
of two horns on a beast.

467
00:59:35,068 --> 00:59:39,906
It was a Wiccan symbol, a
creature of peace and power.

468
00:59:42,776 --> 00:59:45,445
Oh, but occasionally,
someone special is born

469
00:59:46,346 --> 00:59:47,848
with a third horn.

470
00:59:51,584 --> 00:59:52,452
I'm not special.

471
00:59:53,386 --> 00:59:54,821
Oh, you'll see.

472
00:59:56,056 --> 00:59:57,590
When the time comes.

473
01:00:01,194 --> 01:00:03,263
You want to know
more about Dominique?

474
01:00:04,698 --> 01:00:05,531
Yes.

475
01:00:06,432 --> 01:00:07,333
And what of Botis?

476
01:00:10,336 --> 01:00:15,341
A demon who has fascinated
Dominique for many years.

477
01:00:16,877 --> 01:00:21,882
Her extracurricular
activities worried me greatly

478
01:00:22,582 --> 01:00:23,784
when she was my student.

479
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:27,451
Like all demons,
he has his domain.

480
01:00:27,453 --> 01:00:31,455
He is cut off from this realm.

481
01:00:31,457 --> 01:00:36,462
But when the stars are
right, the door to open it,

482
01:00:38,364 --> 01:00:39,599
it becomes easier.

483
01:00:40,934 --> 01:00:42,703
She
means to release him?

484
01:00:43,837 --> 01:00:44,637
Yes.

485
01:00:52,512 --> 01:00:54,545
Why are you
watching my school?

486
01:00:54,547 --> 01:00:55,916
Go to hell.

487
01:00:55,949 --> 01:00:57,784
How about I bring hell to you!

488
01:01:10,764 --> 01:01:11,798
Why are you alone?

489
01:01:13,266 --> 01:01:14,100
Where are they?

490
01:01:15,668 --> 01:01:17,570
Where are your sisters?

491
01:01:35,255 --> 01:01:37,057
I can see your thoughts.

492
01:01:41,094 --> 01:01:41,928
Tilda.

493
01:01:59,379 --> 01:02:00,847
You won't get far.

494
01:02:04,617 --> 01:02:09,589
Dominique has been
appeasing his lust

495
01:02:10,757 --> 01:02:13,927
for essence and
soul with sacrifice.

496
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:18,331
And with each one, she
herself becomes more powerful.

497
01:02:20,166 --> 01:02:25,171
It takes a great deal of
power to release Bortis, but

498
01:02:26,672 --> 01:02:30,710
it takes even more
to control him.

499
01:02:32,012 --> 01:02:36,416
That is why she is
so taken with you.

500
01:02:38,985 --> 01:02:43,990
Your sacrifice means the
Botis will become her slave,

501
01:02:47,828 --> 01:02:52,432
and the world as we
know it will end.

502
01:02:52,465 --> 01:02:54,032
We will get Dominique.

503
01:02:54,034 --> 01:02:55,335
We'll fight this.

504
01:02:56,669 --> 01:02:57,570
Then you must go.

505
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:01,507
You must prepare.

506
01:03:09,549 --> 01:03:11,584
May we visit you after?

507
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:15,889
In the next life, maybe.

508
01:03:19,459 --> 01:03:21,327
You will send my love to Elena.

509
01:03:23,096 --> 01:03:23,864
We will.

510
01:03:27,467 --> 01:03:28,301
Thank you.

511
01:03:31,371 --> 01:03:33,173
- Good luck.
- Goodbye.

512
01:03:36,176 --> 01:03:37,043
Thank you.

513
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:05,205
Oh my god, Elena!

514
01:04:11,211 --> 01:04:12,545
Sam, Lucy, help!

515
01:04:19,152 --> 01:04:21,585
What happened to her?

516
01:04:21,587 --> 01:04:23,922
It's an Agravarian slug.

517
01:04:23,924 --> 01:04:25,058
No.

518
01:04:25,091 --> 01:04:26,126
How do we stop it?

519
01:04:26,993 --> 01:04:28,461
I have an antidote for it.

520
01:04:29,862 --> 01:04:32,496
Keep her warm, don't
let her convulse.

521
01:04:32,498 --> 01:04:33,433
I'll be right back.

522
01:04:34,867 --> 01:04:37,703
Elena, stay with us.

523
01:04:37,737 --> 01:04:39,403
Stay strong, I need you.

524
01:04:39,405 --> 01:04:40,473
We all need you.

525
01:04:44,277 --> 01:04:47,447
Remember, two drops,
no more, no less.

526
01:04:51,051 --> 01:04:51,884
Okay.

527
01:04:53,319 --> 01:04:54,420
Hold her mouth open.

528
01:04:58,992 --> 01:04:59,825
Come on.

529
01:05:00,793 --> 01:05:01,627
Okay.

530
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:08,134
Okay.

531
01:05:11,037 --> 01:05:12,205
Okay, come on.

532
01:05:13,673 --> 01:05:14,507
Okay.

533
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:17,110
Come on.

534
01:05:20,846 --> 01:05:21,681
Get it out.

535
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:25,885
Good, good girl.

536
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:17,203
What are you working on?

537
01:06:17,237 --> 01:06:19,872
I'm working on breaking
a protection spell.

538
01:06:20,806 --> 01:06:23,209
And I'm almost done.

539
01:06:26,912 --> 01:06:28,014
How's Elena doing?

540
01:06:28,048 --> 01:06:29,047
She's okay.

541
01:06:29,049 --> 01:06:31,717
She's out in the back with Jess.

542
01:06:33,086 --> 01:06:34,052
Great.

543
01:06:34,054 --> 01:06:35,119
I brought you this.

544
01:06:35,121 --> 01:06:36,056
Oh, thank you.

545
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:39,125
Oh, these are beautiful.

546
01:06:39,159 --> 01:06:40,660
Remember what I taught you.

547
01:06:41,861 --> 01:06:42,662
Breathe in.

548
01:06:44,130 --> 01:06:45,131
Focus.

549
01:06:48,201 --> 01:06:49,035
Focus.

550
01:06:51,671 --> 01:06:52,672
You can do this

551
01:07:08,788 --> 01:07:10,123
I did it!

552
01:07:10,156 --> 01:07:11,755
You did!

553
01:07:11,757 --> 01:07:12,958
I can't believe it!

554
01:07:12,992 --> 01:07:15,027
It went so fast,
did you see that?

555
01:07:15,095 --> 01:07:16,596
Yes, it was awesome.

556
01:07:17,697 --> 01:07:19,497
- Wanna do it again?
- Yeah I do!

557
01:07:19,499 --> 01:07:21,033
So fun.

558
01:07:48,461 --> 01:07:50,128
You old crow.

559
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:52,330
I told you not to interfere!

560
01:07:52,332 --> 01:07:53,199
Yet you defied me.

561
01:08:02,007 --> 01:08:03,876
What did you tell them?

562
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:08,748
It matters not, now.

563
01:08:10,216 --> 01:08:14,220
Once I have the girl, I will
release and enslave Botis.

564
01:08:21,026 --> 01:08:24,528
There must be something
inside of you, Dominique,

565
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:28,801
something of that girl who
first came to my Academy.

566
01:08:28,834 --> 01:08:30,203
My Academy!

567
01:08:41,381 --> 01:08:43,883
How could
you release Botis?

568
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:46,085
There will be nothing left!

569
01:08:46,118 --> 01:08:47,953
What's left is mine.

570
01:11:20,005 --> 01:11:25,010
When sacred blood is
spilled, the gates will open.

571
01:11:26,111 --> 01:11:29,181
He will rise, and those
who burned us alive

572
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:32,251
will meet their demise.

573
01:11:34,787 --> 01:11:37,757
I will allow you to
live to see hell.

574
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:51,671
Elena, wake up.

575
01:11:51,704 --> 01:11:53,170
Wake up!

576
01:11:53,172 --> 01:11:54,540
Come on, Elena.

577
01:11:57,276 --> 01:11:58,578
Where's Jessica.

578
01:12:11,591 --> 01:12:12,425
Sam!

579
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:01,974
Are we too late?

580
01:13:03,175 --> 01:13:05,543
We have until
midnight tonight.

581
01:13:05,545 --> 01:13:08,614
That's when the blood
moon is at its fullest

582
01:13:08,681 --> 01:13:11,851
and the planets are
all in alignment.

583
01:13:11,884 --> 01:13:14,317
Our focus needs to
be on rescuing Jessica

584
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:16,253
first and foremost.

585
01:13:16,255 --> 01:13:20,125
Without her, Dominique
cannot control the demon.

586
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,626
Can she release
him without her?

587
01:13:22,628 --> 01:13:25,865
If they do unleash him, we've
got a short window of time

588
01:13:25,931 --> 01:13:29,735
to put him back before his
power fully forms in this realm.

589
01:13:31,571 --> 01:13:32,572
Would she do that?

590
01:13:33,639 --> 01:13:36,075
We will prepare for the fight,

591
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:39,044
The power of three.

592
01:13:40,212 --> 01:13:42,546
The power of three.

593
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:44,915
The power of three.

594
01:13:44,917 --> 01:13:47,119
The power of three.

595
01:14:09,675 --> 01:14:11,343
The hour is almost upon us.

596
01:14:12,878 --> 01:14:16,248
It's a shame you won't be
around to witness the new dawn.

597
01:14:20,786 --> 01:14:22,454
I shall return soon.

598
01:14:24,423 --> 01:14:27,593
I think we have visitors
I should prepare for.

599
01:15:43,502 --> 01:15:44,570
Unleash me!

600
01:15:48,307 --> 01:15:51,877
I will sacrifice the
final offering soon.

601
01:15:55,781 --> 01:15:56,882
Release me!

602
01:15:59,418 --> 01:16:01,754
You pledge your power
to my every command?

603
01:16:05,758 --> 01:16:08,493
If the offering
satisfies, yes.

604
01:16:13,532 --> 01:16:14,366
It will.

605
01:16:58,277 --> 01:16:59,611
Stop right there.

606
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:10,956
Don't even think about it.

607
01:18:00,139 --> 01:18:01,173
I warned you.

608
01:18:04,043 --> 01:18:05,945
Come on, we better go.

609
01:18:11,951 --> 01:18:12,985
This is it.

610
01:18:17,222 --> 01:18:18,057
Jessica?

611
01:18:33,138 --> 01:18:37,276
Water, earth, fire, air,
feel the pain, feel my stare.

612
01:18:52,925 --> 01:18:54,493
Lucy, are you all right?

613
01:18:54,526 --> 01:18:55,360
Lucy!

614
01:18:58,597 --> 01:19:00,332
Dominique has a voodoo doll!

615
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:05,070
I can break the spell,
give me your hand.

616
01:19:10,075 --> 01:19:11,010
It's okay.

617
01:19:16,515 --> 01:19:18,181
Stay with me.

618
01:19:18,183 --> 01:19:20,719
Hold my hand, stay with me.

619
01:19:29,461 --> 01:19:30,295
Lucy.

620
01:20:07,132 --> 01:20:08,133
You're okay.

621
01:20:10,035 --> 01:20:10,903
You okay?

622
01:20:17,877 --> 01:20:18,708
Are you okay?

623
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:19,542
Are you okay?

624
01:20:19,544 --> 01:20:20,745
She's okay, she's okay.

625
01:20:20,779 --> 01:20:22,112
We have to get to
the great hall.

626
01:20:22,114 --> 01:20:24,183
That's where she'll
perform the sacrifice.

627
01:20:24,216 --> 01:20:25,548
Okay.

628
01:20:25,550 --> 01:20:26,385
Okay.

629
01:21:05,457 --> 01:21:06,959
She's weakening!

630
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:11,964
No!

631
01:21:28,513 --> 01:21:33,485
Are you all right?

632
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:36,388
You all right?

633
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,202
I await my sacrifice.

634
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:57,509
I cannot give her to you!

635
01:22:05,384 --> 01:22:09,754
You must give me more
blood of power to release me!

636
01:22:16,161 --> 01:22:17,862
You'll get your sacrifice.

637
01:22:19,965 --> 01:22:21,967
In exchange for a promise.

638
01:22:29,408 --> 01:22:30,809
Of what to you?

639
01:22:33,078 --> 01:22:34,213
Destruction.

640
01:22:35,614 --> 01:22:36,515
Turmoil.

641
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:41,953
Blackness, death of everyone
in the Belle bloodline.

642
01:22:55,867 --> 01:22:56,735
So be it.

643
01:23:30,302 --> 01:23:32,971
Oh great Botis, demon of dark.

644
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,842
Accept my final offering...

645
01:23:40,045 --> 01:23:42,047
And fulfill my last wish.

646
01:23:47,319 --> 01:23:48,153
No!

647
01:23:51,456 --> 01:23:52,291
No!

648
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:49,214
Run!

649
01:24:54,919 --> 01:24:55,754
Quickly.

650
01:25:00,459 --> 01:25:01,958
Where is he?

651
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:05,364
We have to banish him, so
his power doesn't go stronger.

652
01:25:08,533 --> 01:25:10,068
Don't break the circle.

653
01:25:10,135 --> 01:25:12,036
Don't break the circle.

654
01:25:28,119 --> 01:25:30,289
Don't break the circle.

655
01:25:30,322 --> 01:25:32,257
Don't break the circle.

656
01:25:47,372 --> 01:25:48,173
Where is he?

657
01:26:06,425 --> 01:26:08,092
What is happening?

658
01:26:09,994 --> 01:26:11,363
Don't, Jessica.

659
01:26:20,004 --> 01:26:23,007
I'll take what
was promised to me!

660
01:27:38,783 --> 01:27:39,618
Demon dead.

661
01:27:42,754 --> 01:27:43,620
We did it.

662
01:27:43,622 --> 01:27:44,656
Dead demon!

663
01:28:06,778 --> 01:28:08,945
Is Jessica still sleeping?

664
01:28:08,947 --> 01:28:11,950
Yeah, she's been restless
the last few nights.

665
01:28:13,217 --> 01:28:14,419
What did we decide?

666
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:16,921
About the Academy girls?

667
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:23,027
Well, I say they're
eager to learn from us.

668
01:28:23,094 --> 01:28:26,130
We teach them, and we set
them on the right path.

669
01:28:28,633 --> 01:28:31,803
But I don't think we should
teach them at the Academy.

670
01:28:31,836 --> 01:28:33,204
Those walls are cursed.

671
01:28:33,237 --> 01:28:34,038
Hmm.

672
01:28:35,674 --> 01:28:37,208
But we could teach them here.

673
01:28:40,211 --> 01:28:41,045
Agreed.

674
01:28:49,621 --> 01:28:50,787
Sam?

675
01:28:50,789 --> 01:28:51,790
Lucy, Elena!

676
01:28:56,461 --> 01:28:57,762
Jess, what's the matter?

677
01:28:59,464 --> 01:29:00,532
Something's coming.

678
01:29:02,534 --> 01:29:03,735
We need to go to Salem.

679
01:29:07,038 --> 01:29:08,339
You gotta be kidding me.

680
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:19,500
