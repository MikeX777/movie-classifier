1
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,910
¶ Well you never can tell
but you're looking so well ¶

2
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:08,000
¶ That I gotta stop and say
How do you do? ¶

3
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:12,004
¶ I know it's a long shot
but judging what she's got ¶

4
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:15,608
¶ I'm hoping that my judgement's true ¶

5
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,744
¶ Hey girl beautiful girl ¶

6
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,082
¶ Can I look at your insides? ¶

7
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:26,733
¶ Girl wrapped up in fur ¶

8
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,690
¶ I'm just mad for your outsides ¶

9
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,876
¶ Mm that's what my inside says ¶

10
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:39,431
¶ If only I could walk up and tell her ¶

11
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:43,302
¶ But it seems so far from me to her ¶

12
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:48,155
¶ And the ground is so unfamiliar ¶

13
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:51,844
¶ Well I wish that I knew
'cause I'd be in a stew ¶

14
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:57,049
¶ If my little speech
sounded like a phony line ¶

15
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:01,101
¶ I know that it's doubtful
'cause she's heard a mouthful ¶

16
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,589
¶ Of come on up and see me sometime ¶

17
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:07,726
¶ Hey girl beautiful girl ¶

18
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:13,065
¶ Can I look at your insides? ¶

19
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,538
¶ Girl wrapped up in fur
I'm just mad for your outsides ¶

20
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:41,008
¶ Well you never can tell
but you're looking so well ¶

21
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:46,147
¶ That I gotta stop and say
How do you do? ¶

22
00:02:46,167 --> 00:02:50,102
¶ I know it's a long shot
but judging what she's got ¶

23
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:53,706
¶ I'm hoping that my judgement's true ¶

24
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,775
¶ Hey girl beautiful girl ¶

25
00:02:56,911 --> 00:03:01,080
¶ Can I look at your insides? ¶

26
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:04,583
¶ Girl wrapped up in fur ¶

27
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,970
¶ I'm just mad for your outsides ¶

28
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,525
¶ Girl beautiful girl ¶

29
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,862
¶ Can I look at your insides? ¶¶

30
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:50,677
You absolutely must not use
the book elevator, Bernard.

31
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:51,897
Who is she?

32
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,414
It's illegal, it's dangerous

33
00:03:53,434 --> 00:03:56,034
'and it's only gonna get you into trouble.'

34
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,621
Reading Room main, Del Grado speaking.

35
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,974
'My son has just stepped out'

36
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,690
'of the book elevator, Del Grado.'

37
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,026
- 'Put him on.'
- Hm. Double trouble.

38
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,494
Especially when it's your own father

39
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,914
and he has eyes everywhere.

40
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:10,383
Can you hear me, dad?

41
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,434
'I'll see you in my office
right now, big boy.'

42
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:16,989
'Say, uh, Bernard,
when you call your father dad'

43
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,640
are you really thinking daddy?

44
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,908
Hm, which is his real name

45
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,509
but inappropriate when you're pushing 20.

46
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,797
'I don't know what to call him anymore.'

47
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,915
Well, let's see. Pop.

48
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,335
- Too jolly.
- Mm-hmm.

49
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:34,255
- How about papa?
- 'Sounds kind of foreign.'

50
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:37,610
Well, father is as phony as dad.

51
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,726
It's a great problem deciding
what to call your father

52
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,146
when you're all grown up.

53
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:44,150
You know, you could use his initials.

54
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,086
IH?

55
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:50,155
He's waiting for you, Bernard.

56
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:53,959
- International harvester.
- He's mad.

57
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,828
Internal hemorrhage.

58
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,398
Come in, Bernard.

59
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:04,351
Sit down.

60
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,971
Your mother's here.

61
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,706
Why are you wearing your eyeglasses?

62
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:09,842
You promised me
that you would never wear those.

63
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,110
Excuse me, mom.

64
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:12,960
Now let's forget about eyeglasses today.

65
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,495
- Margery.
- I won't forget about them.

66
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:18,565
We spent $200 for contact lenses
and he never wears it.

67
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,665
'I don't wanna talk about
contact lenses, eyeglasses'

68
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,170
chlorophyll pills,
bow legs or plastic surgery.

69
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,858
- I wanna talk about our son.
- That is our son.

70
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,196
- Bernard..
- I-I'm listening, dad.

71
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,666
How long have you been working
here at the library?

72
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,716
One month, father.

73
00:05:35,736 --> 00:05:37,584
- Are you happy here?
- Yes, pop.

74
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:40,673
Then why do you embarrass me
every time you get the chance?

75
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,275
Bernard, Bernard, what are you doing?

76
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,993
- Lost my lens.
- Oh, don't anybody move.

77
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,194
- Nobody move.
- Del Grado, wake up!

78
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:49,882
- Get in here.
- Yes, yes, IH.

79
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:52,733
Now find my son's contact lens.
Bernard, sit.

80
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:55,402
Right. Uh, Bernard,
was it the right or the left?

81
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,690
- Just look for it.
- He embarrasses me, too.

82
00:05:57,824 --> 00:06:01,894
But that's just the way he is.
I mean, I won't blame myself.

83
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,962
- I won't, I won't!
- 'Yes, IH?'

84
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:06,347
- Nothing! Nothing.
- What way am I?

85
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,367
Damned irresponsible,
that's what you are, big boy.

86
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:10,351
But you can rest assured,
once aware of the fact

87
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,771
that one's irresponsibility
is as just as much

88
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:15,908
one's parents' responsibility
as one's own responsibility.

89
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:20,245
I'm sorry I embarrass you,
daddy, and-and you, mommy.

90
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,029
Mom.

91
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,716
I'm even sorry I embarrass myself.

92
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,232
Ha! I found it.

93
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:28,253
- Oh, how nice of you.
- That's all, Del Grado.

94
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,570
Thanks, Raef.

95
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,924
I'll wait till you put it
in your other eye.

96
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:36,195
'Careful, careful. Don't.. Oh. Oh.'

97
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,779
'Careful, darling. That's, right there.'

98
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,866
'Ooh, a little to the left.'

99
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,204
Oh, there it is.

100
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,608
Oh..

101
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:51,392
Ready, papa.

102
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:53,346
You've been here a month.

103
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,996
And aside from developing unnatural skills

104
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:58,551
on roller skates,
you've been a complete failure.

105
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,267
'If your father wasn't much your father is'

106
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,020
'you'd been fired your first week here.'

107
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:04,405
Now here it is, big boy,
straight and to the point.

108
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,691
- Grow up! Quiet!
- Oh, he's too young.

109
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:08,409
You're gonna live in
your own apartment in the city

110
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:10,211
pay for it with your own money.
What do you say to that?

111
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:12,164
- Terrific!
- Oh, he's too young.

112
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,366
He's too young.

113
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,502
Margery, your lint is settling
on the Gutenberg Bible.

114
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,440
You're going to be lonely

115
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:25,177
living all by yourself
in that tiny apartment.

116
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,895
You're going to miss
your, your room in Great Neck.

117
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,416
- I know you are.
- Hello, Bernard.

118
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:32,833
Hi.

119
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,987
I brought Rover along in the car.

120
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,037
We better hurry, I don't
want him getting impatient

121
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,058
all over the upholstery.

122
00:07:40,395 --> 00:07:42,309
Rover.

123
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,197
Big dog, nice dog. Hang dog.

124
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:48,267
See how excited Rover is to see you?

125
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:50,069
You know your name isn't Rover?

126
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,920
You're my dog, I christened you
Dog eight years ago

127
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,440
when we were pups together.

128
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:05,284
Who is that girl
working in your father's office?

129
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,220
- She looks very cheap.
- Nobody special.

130
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:11,223
Well, what's her name, darling?
Everybody's got a name.

131
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:14,026
- Even Rover.
- Amy Partlett.

132
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,277
Sometimes I really wonder who's responsible

133
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:18,497
for hiring people in that office.

134
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:20,681
Certainly not your father.

135
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,635
'Mother, do you like people's faces?'

136
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:24,503
I mean, do you ever really

137
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,555
consider them? Or do you ever
think about them?

138
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:30,375
You haven't been spending your time

139
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,377
with girls like that, have you, Bernard?

140
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,913
I like to invent names for people's faces.

141
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,249
I mean, cheap girls like that.

142
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,852
Barnie Benzadream.

143
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,320
I don't like the way she dresses.

144
00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:44,305
Willy Whileaway.

145
00:08:44,325 --> 00:08:46,058
And the way she wets her lips

146
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,175
with her tongue before she speaks.

147
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,864
- Her teeth are crooked.
- 'Lonely Lozenges.'

148
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:55,734
I don't want you to associate
with girls of that kind.

149
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,404
Bernard, Rover is scratching
the glove compartment.

150
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,324
- Dog! Dog.
- No, Dog!

151
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:04,984
- You know his name.
- Oh, that's alright.

152
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:06,727
Ms. Thing, Rover is just visiting.

153
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,729
No, he'll have to wait outside.

154
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,798
- Oh?
- Well, unless you carry him.

155
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:15,821
I don't want dog hairs
all over my building.

156
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,090
You're a nice boy. What's your name?

157
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,206
Tell Ms. Thing your name.

158
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,625
- Bernard.
- 'Bernard.'

159
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,544
Bernard was 19 years old just 4 months ago.

160
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:26,565
Oh! Well, happy birthday, Bernard.

161
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:30,703
A nice room for nice
birthday boy. Isn't that right?

162
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:34,639
Bernard, this is Patrolman Graf.
One of New York's finest.

163
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,509
New tenant, Mr. Graf.

164
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,577
This was my older brother's building.

165
00:09:38,713 --> 00:09:41,646
'But he passed away,
and I guess it's all mine now.'

166
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:44,917
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Even his rooster.

167
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:47,119
He had a pet rooster.

168
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:49,654
'Oh, well, he left me everything he had.'

169
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,639
But in his will it stipulated
that the rooster must live

170
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,794
on the fifth floor,
unmolested, in perpetuity.

171
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,244
Oh, careful, Mrs. Chanticleer

172
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,997
my brother's rooster hates females.

173
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,265
He just barely tolerates me.

174
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:01,734
Shoo-shoo-shoo-shoo. Oh!

175
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:03,250
Stand back. Shoo.

176
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,338
Oh, look at that.
He's already made friends.

177
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,988
- 'Ah.'
- Ha-ha-ha..

178
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:11,276
Well, here it is.
And may it ever be so humble.

179
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,470
Oh, I don't know about these stairs.

180
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,606
Bernard's right leg is one full inch

181
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,226
shorter than his left leg, you know?

182
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,675
- Oh.
- 'I don't mind the stairs. I... '

183
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:31,564
And rooster, you say, in the city?

184
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:35,282
- That attacks people?
- Well, not people, only girls.

185
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,817
Oh. Girls only?

186
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,486
The younger and the prettier,
the more he hates them.

187
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:42,289
- Claws at their nylons.
- Is that a fact?

188
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:46,045
- I think it's nice.
- So do I, darling.

189
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,830
Oh, why don't you and Rover
go in and look around the room

190
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,352
while mommy and Ms. Thing
have a little chat?

191
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:01,360
WC.

192
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:03,863
Warring countries.

193
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:09,134
Now, here's enough
for three telephone calls.

194
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,430
And when you use up the three

195
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,404
I'll give you enough for three more.

196
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,806
Welcome Communists.

197
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,746
Bear with me, I must know if
there are girls telephoning him.

198
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:24,216
Bernard has not been able
to deal with life yet.

199
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,685
And he's certainly not ready for girls.

200
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:32,891
See? Bernard baby, are you alright?

201
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:34,427
Bernard? Bernard?

202
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:38,230
Goodbye, Mrs. Chanticleer.
Everything will be fine. Fine.

203
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,747
Call me whenever you're depressed, Bernard.

204
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:41,867
I will, mother.

205
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:47,354
And remember my promise.

206
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,841
If you don't smoke until you're 21

207
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:51,310
you'll get a special no-smoking present.

208
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:52,845
- Bye.
- Say goodbye to Rover.

209
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,449
- He's brokenhearted.
- Goodbye, Dog.

210
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,051
Now, don't eat too much.
Don't stay out late.

211
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,902
Don't go to suspicious places
to play cards.

212
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,656
And stay away from girls.

213
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,859
But most of all, Bernard, try to be happy.

214
00:13:03,784 --> 00:13:05,584
"Niggers go home."

215
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:12,058
But where's home?

216
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,862
Home is where the heart is.

217
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:22,635
Yeah, but where are their hearts?

218
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:26,138
My heart's in the highlands.

219
00:18:45,326 --> 00:18:47,460
Gosh! Amy. Oh, you..

220
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:50,529
I don't usually come to places
like this. I mean, I just dro...

221
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:52,713
Don't be embarrassed
about being here, Bernard.

222
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:54,867
Not on my account.

223
00:18:55,002 --> 00:18:56,882
I mean, I'm only too happy
to, to bump into you.

224
00:18:57,004 --> 00:19:00,506
I mean, really I.. I..

225
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:09,815
<i>When you first came to, um, the library</i>

226
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,599
<i>I thought I saw you some place before.</i>

227
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,002
<i>I mean, uh, I liked you.</i>

228
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:16,537
<i>Then I remembered that I remembered you</i>

229
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:18,139
<i>some place, so I went..</i>

230
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:21,008
<i>I knew I had seen your face
before, so I went home</i>

231
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:22,143
<i>and I looked in the old school book</i>

232
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:24,211
<i>PS 109, and there you were.</i>

233
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:26,832
<i>- P.. Did you go to PS 109?
- Yes, so did you.</i>

234
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:29,301
<i>Say, when? I went to PS 33.</i>

235
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:31,570
<i>Then I went to PS 78,
then I went-went to PS 109.</i>

236
00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:33,866
<i>- I don't remember you. No.
- But-but I remember you.</i>

237
00:19:33,908 --> 00:19:36,223
<i>I wanna tell you,
I remember you because you</i>

238
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:39,578
<i>one day you came into our classroom</i>

239
00:19:39,714 --> 00:19:44,116
<i>you had made a suit of armor
out of Reynolds aluminum wrap.</i>

240
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:47,052
<i>Hey, I-I remember that,
I came into the classroom</i>

241
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:49,454
<i>like, I was all dressed up
in that thing looking..</i>

242
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,257
<i>I remember that. But I don't
remember you, though.</i>

243
00:19:52,393 --> 00:19:53,926
<i>Did you see me wearing that thing?</i>

244
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:55,109
<i>- Yes, you looked wonderful.
- Oh.</i>

245
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:56,395
<i>That was great. I remember.</i>

246
00:19:56,531 --> 00:19:57,978
<i>- You looked great!
- Six rolls.</i>

247
00:19:57,998 --> 00:19:59,932
<i>Of Reynolds aluminum..</i>

248
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:02,249
<i>I just remember you were looking sweet.</i>

249
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:03,602
<i>But wait a minute.. Were you..</i>

250
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:05,186
<i>I was in the back row I think.</i>

251
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:08,741
<i>- Who was the teacher?
- But you were far away.</i>

252
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,457
<i>Remember I always used to wait
for my father</i>

253
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:13,612
<i>to take me by the five-cent pretzel man.</i>

254
00:20:13,748 --> 00:20:16,749
<i>Those pretzels are 15 cents now
and they aren't as good.</i>

255
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:19,752
<i>There wasn't any pretzel man at PS 109.</i>

256
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:23,822
<i>That must have been PS 33.</i>

257
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,540
<i>What difference does it make where it was?</i>

258
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,025
<i>The pretzels are 15 cents now.</i>

259
00:20:27,161 --> 00:20:28,227
<i>Oh.</i>

260
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:32,813
<i>Do you remember me from PS 109?</i>

261
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:36,301
<i>No. I only remember the pretzels.</i>

262
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:42,274
I'll see you.

263
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:47,246
Hey, Amy.

264
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:49,181
- Yeah?
- 'Hey, I do remember you.'

265
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:51,232
It was PS 109. That wasn't PS 78.

266
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:53,786
I came into your class in
my Reynolds aluminum wrap on.

267
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:57,256
Hey, but, Amy, you were so ugly..

268
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:01,393
...then.

269
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:28,220
Hello, big boy.

270
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:30,022
Who? Me?

271
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:31,223
Who else?

272
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:36,829
I don't understand.

273
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:40,281
It wasn't meant that we understand, Bernard

274
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:44,503
but that we see the bacteria in the dust

275
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:48,874
in the rays of the dying sun,
and not ask questions.

276
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:53,360
What-what kind of questions?

277
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,962
Well, you take me too literally, Bernard.

278
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:58,050
Now look, I'm a poet,
and I'm a little vague.

279
00:21:58,185 --> 00:21:59,852
But that's the secret of my success.

280
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,253
Well, what kind of success?

281
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:04,256
With girls. Girls!

282
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,707
That's what's on your mind day
and night, isn't it, Bernard?

283
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:09,510
That's why you're late for work,
why you walk into walls

284
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,578
misfile your books. Girls.

285
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:14,399
Now look, some morning
when it's sunny and windy

286
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:15,868
we'll go out and fly kites

287
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:19,186
and I'll explain all the mysteries away.

288
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:21,322
Oh, don't you think it's very odd

289
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:23,876
that we should kneel and pray to God

290
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:25,544
when by all accounts we might

291
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,881
send our problems up by kites?

292
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,283
You know, Bernard, if you wanna grow up

293
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:33,134
'first thing you got to do
is learn how to smoke.'

294
00:22:33,154 --> 00:22:34,935
Okay. Smoke what?

295
00:22:34,955 --> 00:22:37,757
Ah. You learn fast. Come here.

296
00:22:41,962 --> 00:22:44,196
- What is it?
- Cigarette, Bernard.

297
00:22:47,702 --> 00:22:49,350
Looks pretty badly made to me.

298
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:52,037
Mm. Bernard.

299
00:22:52,173 --> 00:22:54,173
Oh, uh, by the way, I have a little

300
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:56,308
scented missive here for you.

301
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:59,378
Mm. Signed AP. Guess what?

302
00:22:59,514 --> 00:23:00,514
Associated Press.

303
00:23:01,716 --> 00:23:03,030
Amy Partlett, Bernard.

304
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,166
Now look, you, uh

305
00:23:05,186 --> 00:23:07,452
want to get past that awkward stage, right?

306
00:23:07,588 --> 00:23:09,036
You wanna grow up, right?

307
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,655
- I'm dying to grow up.
- Right.

308
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:13,458
Then you need a girl who's, uh, willing.

309
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:15,194
I said loving.

310
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:18,531
Amy Partlett, Bernard.
She's interested in you.

311
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:20,399
'She says right there, "Dear Bernard'

312
00:23:20,535 --> 00:23:24,336
I had a wonderful time
last night talking to you. AP."

313
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:26,539
- Amy Partlett is not willing.
- Oh!

314
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:28,856
He said with horror on his face.

315
00:23:28,876 --> 00:23:30,791
Bernard, what do you think sex is?

316
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:33,060
- Shh! Raef.
- Sex, Bernard.

317
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,949
Sexy, sexual, sextet, sextant

318
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:40,152
sex-tenial, sexagenarian.

319
00:23:40,287 --> 00:23:43,270
- Raef, that is immoral.
- So, still a virgin, huh?

320
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,206
Go on, you can tell old Raef.

321
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:47,960
- Yeah, I am.
- Uh-oh! Bernard, look..

322
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:15,981
String broke.

323
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:18,050
No, no. I cut it.

324
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:20,853
- You did what?
- I cut the string, Bernard.

325
00:25:20,988 --> 00:25:22,655
We had no right to bring that thing down.

326
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:24,171
Anyway, I always do it that way.

327
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:26,307
But isn't that a waste?

328
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:30,062
My son, your way is a waste.

329
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:32,465
I'm very sorry you didn't
appreciate the ritual.

330
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,199
I did, really.

331
00:25:34,335 --> 00:25:36,268
Look, you cut your hand on the kite string.

332
00:25:36,403 --> 00:25:37,784
- It's inevitable.
- Then..

333
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:40,072
Why don't you wear gloves?

334
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:43,008
Pain is part of it all.

335
00:25:43,144 --> 00:25:45,611
- Of what?
- Freedom.

336
00:25:47,482 --> 00:25:48,482
Look.

337
00:25:56,957 --> 00:25:58,957
'Raef'

338
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:02,943
do you see... her?

339
00:26:02,963 --> 00:26:06,347
Oh, yeah. I see her.
I've seen her and seen her.

340
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:08,300
- 'Who is she?'
- Oh, she's an actress.

341
00:26:08,435 --> 00:26:12,153
I, uh, I know a friend who knows a friend

342
00:26:12,173 --> 00:26:14,773
who knows a friend who knows her.

343
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:16,157
What's her name?

344
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:17,710
'Darling. Barbara Darling.'

345
00:26:17,845 --> 00:26:21,829
Aah, but come on, Bernard,
uh, AP is waiting for you.

346
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:24,550
AP? Who is AP?

347
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,252
Another problem.

348
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:35,376
¶ Well you never can tell
but you're looking so well ¶

349
00:26:35,396 --> 00:26:40,599
¶ That I gotta stop and say
How do you do? ¶

350
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:44,737
¶ I know it's a long shot
but judging what she's got ¶

351
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:48,455
¶ I'm hoping that my judgement's true ¶

352
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:51,744
¶ Hey girl beautiful girl ¶

353
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:56,048
¶ Can I look at your insides? ¶

354
00:26:57,151 --> 00:26:59,552
¶ Girl wrapped up in fur ¶

355
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:03,522
¶ I'm just mad for your outsides ¶

356
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:08,761
¶ Mm that's what my inside says ¶

357
00:27:08,896 --> 00:27:12,565
¶ If only I could walk up and tell her ¶

358
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:16,569
¶ But it seems so far from me to her ¶

359
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:20,172
¶ And the ground is so unfamiliar ¶

360
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:23,175
I'm certainly glad
you brought me here tonight.

361
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,226
Yeah. Terrific in here, isn't it?

362
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:27,179
I can't hear you.

363
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:30,382
Yeah. Terrific in here, isn't it?

364
00:27:30,517 --> 00:27:33,386
¶ I know that it's doubtful ¶

365
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,388
I didn't know you smoked.

366
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:37,905
¶ See me sometime ¶

367
00:27:37,925 --> 00:27:39,524
Oh, yeah, all the time.

368
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,194
¶ Beautiful girl can I look ¶¶

369
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:44,111
Just my luck, whenever I go anywhere

370
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:45,864
the lights always come up!

371
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:55,708
Mine do.

372
00:27:58,078 --> 00:28:00,261
Hey, Bernard, how come
you're sitting way over there?

373
00:28:00,281 --> 00:28:02,329
That's not friendly.

374
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:03,649
I don't know.

375
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:08,287
Didn't you ever hear the expression

376
00:28:08,422 --> 00:28:09,822
"Like father, like son?"

377
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:41,721
Barbara.

378
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:51,263
Bernard?

379
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:57,670
Come on and dance with me, Bernard.

380
00:28:57,805 --> 00:28:59,604
I can't.

381
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,474
Come on. I'll show you how.

382
00:29:03,144 --> 00:29:04,877
I-I can't dance.

383
00:29:12,153 --> 00:29:13,752
Come on with me.

384
00:29:23,698 --> 00:29:24,698
Me!

385
00:29:28,835 --> 00:29:29,835
Me!

386
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:43,248
- I wanna go somewhere else.
- Okay.

387
00:29:45,652 --> 00:29:48,921
- Bernard, I like you.
- I like you, too, Amy.

388
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:50,389
I mean, really.

389
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:56,829
Why don't you show me where you live?

390
00:29:58,665 --> 00:30:00,933
I'd, I'd love to see your new apartment.

391
00:30:01,068 --> 00:30:02,249
Really, I would.

392
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:03,936
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

393
00:30:05,072 --> 00:30:06,639
Why don't you take me there?

394
00:30:08,142 --> 00:30:10,209
- Now?
- Come on. Now.

395
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:38,270
¶ Whoo ¶

396
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:43,342
¶ Whoo ¶

397
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:55,755
You like my mouth?

398
00:30:58,059 --> 00:30:59,059
'Yeah.'

399
00:31:00,327 --> 00:31:01,761
Okay.

400
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:14,440
You're funny. You really are funny.

401
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:19,278
You don't know anything, do you?

402
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:21,514
About what?

403
00:31:22,283 --> 00:31:23,582
About love.

404
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:26,752
About all the sweet things.

405
00:31:33,694 --> 00:31:36,762
¶ Girl beautiful girl ¶

406
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:41,534
¶ Can I look at your inside? ¶

407
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:46,687
¶ Girl wrapped up in fur ¶

408
00:31:46,707 --> 00:31:51,844
¶ I'm just mad for your outsides ¶

409
00:31:54,315 --> 00:31:58,517
¶ Girl beautiful girl ¶

410
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:05,491
¶ Can I look at your insides? ¶

411
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,464
¶ Girl ¶

412
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:12,865
¶ Girl ¶¶

413
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,670
- Hold it! I got it!
- What is that?

414
00:32:17,804 --> 00:32:20,673
- It's a rooster!
- I'm okay!

415
00:32:20,807 --> 00:32:23,075
Help me! Help!

416
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:32,533
- I got it!
- Caught you with a girl.

417
00:32:32,553 --> 00:32:33,934
Wait till your mother hears about this.

418
00:32:33,954 --> 00:32:35,688
Ow!

419
00:32:35,823 --> 00:32:37,338
What's the nature of this disturbance?

420
00:32:37,358 --> 00:32:39,692
- Officer, help me.
- Everybody against the wall.

421
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:41,494
- Stop him!
- Quiet, everybody!

422
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,610
I'm going to call your mother right now

423
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,231
and this call will count
as one of the three.

424
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:48,033
- Ms. Thing, no, don't!
- Ah!

425
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:56,308
If she's dead, you'll burn.

426
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:06,451
You do remember your mother,
don't you, Bernard?

427
00:33:06,587 --> 00:33:07,920
Yes, dad.

428
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:09,415
'Were you remembering your mother'

429
00:33:09,524 --> 00:33:11,772
when you attacked your landlady last night?

430
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:14,441
Bernard, breaking
Ms. Thing's arm was one thing.

431
00:33:14,461 --> 00:33:17,178
But did you have to bring
a<i> girl</i> up to your room?

432
00:33:17,198 --> 00:33:18,330
I'm sorry.

433
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:19,847
I don't want you to see that girl again.

434
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:21,582
Hey, get over there, big boy.

435
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:23,584
- Pay attention.
- To what?

436
00:33:23,604 --> 00:33:26,405
You have disgraced us, Bernard.
You know that.

437
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:27,806
I'm sorry I disgraced you.

438
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:30,409
But, hell, I'm not sorry for liking girls.

439
00:33:30,545 --> 00:33:31,792
I should tell your father you're talking

440
00:33:31,812 --> 00:33:33,145
that way in front of his wife.

441
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,462
- 'Umbrella!'
- But, mom..

442
00:33:35,482 --> 00:33:38,150
I am no longer your mother.

443
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:40,067
Umbrella!

444
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:42,087
Not after last night.

445
00:33:42,223 --> 00:33:43,956
Why should I feel guilty
about liking girls?

446
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:46,607
My heartbeat goes up.
That's involuntary, isn't it?

447
00:33:46,627 --> 00:33:50,878
I don't mind girls.
It is tramps that I object to.

448
00:33:50,898 --> 00:33:52,813
You know she's a tramp, I can tell by that

449
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:54,481
guilty expression
written all over your face.

450
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:57,035
You're right. Every time I look
at a girl, I feel guilty.

451
00:33:57,171 --> 00:33:59,772
- Apologize to your mother.
- 'I'm sorry again.'

452
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:01,007
Margery.

453
00:34:02,843 --> 00:34:04,291
You think maybe we've been too

454
00:34:04,311 --> 00:34:06,093
tough on him, we've cut him off completely?

455
00:34:06,113 --> 00:34:08,295
Well, I didn't want him
to go live alone in the city.

456
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:09,630
It wasn't me.

457
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,784
Big boy, I want you to understand that..

458
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:13,185
Margery, please.

459
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,388
...that one's mother
and one's father loved one..

460
00:34:16,523 --> 00:34:18,105
Only too much.

461
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:21,393
- Let's FN. Family night.
- FN?

462
00:34:21,528 --> 00:34:24,912
We'll, uh, meet you in the city
for dinner one night a week.

463
00:34:24,932 --> 00:34:26,447
We'll take you out to a concert,
or maybe a play.

464
00:34:26,467 --> 00:34:29,001
- How does that sound?
- But what about that girl?

465
00:34:29,136 --> 00:34:31,136
All is forgiven this time, Margery.

466
00:34:31,272 --> 00:34:33,538
We'll put it in the darkroom,
we'll see what develops.

467
00:34:33,674 --> 00:34:35,441
Hm..<i> Vamos.</i>

468
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,412
<i>FN.</i>

469
00:34:39,546 --> 00:34:41,047
<i>Fried noodles.</i>

470
00:34:42,683 --> 00:34:44,016
<i>Fish nougat.</i>

471
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:47,019
<i>Family nonsense.</i>

472
00:34:47,154 --> 00:34:49,221
Oh, aren't we having fun?

473
00:34:49,356 --> 00:34:51,023
Ah! Oh..

474
00:34:51,158 --> 00:34:53,225
Here we are, trapped.

475
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,628
Never spent a night
in a department store before..

476
00:34:55,763 --> 00:34:57,945
Plenty of other places,
but never in a department store.

477
00:34:57,965 --> 00:35:00,433
Hey, I oughta tell you
about my door-opener.

478
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:02,849
Doctor's here, I would cry.

479
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,369
Waltzing into the living room.

480
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:07,172
Who called for the doctor?
I didn't call for the doctor.

481
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:09,188
Well, I'm hale and hearty still,
as you can see.

482
00:35:09,243 --> 00:35:13,045
My doctor used to say to me,
you will live to be a 100!

483
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,180
- You?
- 'Me?'

484
00:35:14,248 --> 00:35:15,296
- You?
- Yes, you.

485
00:35:15,316 --> 00:35:16,849
- Me?
- A 100? Ha-ha..

486
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:19,566
- 'How old are you then?'
- I'm not saying.

487
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:20,853
- That's old.
- Oh!

488
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:23,170
- What? What's that?
- What?

489
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,905
Let's get on with it.
I wanna see him do it.

490
00:35:24,925 --> 00:35:26,125
- 'Ah, do what?'
- 'What?'

491
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,726
This is built for him.

492
00:35:27,862 --> 00:35:30,395
The one under the red,
white and blue dust cover.

493
00:35:33,534 --> 00:35:35,067
Dust, uh, cover.

494
00:35:40,941 --> 00:35:43,408
It's quite significant when

495
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:45,192
nothing means what it seems to mean

496
00:35:45,212 --> 00:35:48,280
'and then you get an idea
of what a lot it means.'

497
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:50,483
Reality is expanded.

498
00:35:50,617 --> 00:35:52,218
That's great, dad.

499
00:35:54,689 --> 00:35:56,689
He can't reach.

500
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:59,624
Oh. It is filthy. He's going to..

501
00:36:03,164 --> 00:36:04,196
Oh, no..

502
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:06,099
I can't.

503
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:09,301
I can't!

504
00:36:12,106 --> 00:36:15,708
You shut your eyes and kiss her.

505
00:36:21,716 --> 00:36:23,549
<i>Dear Barbara Darling.</i>

506
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:28,435
<i>I'm only an ordinary assistant in a library</i>

507
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:31,038
<i>without much to recommend me.</i>

508
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:33,926
<i>But I saw the "Department Store" last night</i>

509
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:37,262
<i>and I haven't been able to forget you.</i>

510
00:36:37,398 --> 00:36:39,380
<i>I must admit that I didn't understand</i>

511
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,734
<i>an awful lot of the play</i>

512
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:43,736
<i>but I thought you were wonderful</i>

513
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:46,253
<i>and displayed enormous talent.</i>

514
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:48,673
<i>And the finest thing
that could ever happen to me</i>

515
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:51,110
<i>would be if I could meet you.</i>

516
00:36:52,813 --> 00:36:55,748
<i>I doubt if you even bothered to read this</i>

517
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:59,618
<i>but if you did, you'd make me very happy.</i>

518
00:37:01,556 --> 00:37:05,891
<i>Yours most sincerely, Bernard Chanticleer.</i>

519
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:09,877
¶ Girl beautiful girl ¶

520
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:11,163
¶ Can I.. ¶¶

521
00:37:15,636 --> 00:37:19,438
¶ Well you never can tell
but you're looking so well ¶

522
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:22,174
'I can't!'

523
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,044
There, I'll show you.

524
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:27,046
¶ I know it's a long shot ¶

525
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:29,181
¶ But judging what she's got ¶

526
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:31,250
- You bitch!
- Go to hell.

527
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:38,523
You see how to do it?
You shut your eyes and kiss her.

528
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:42,194
Next time you pull a stunt
like that on stage

529
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:44,196
I'm gonna slug you right in the mouth.

530
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:45,730
'My tongue is actually bleeding.'

531
00:37:45,866 --> 00:37:46,866
So is my heart.

532
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:48,254
Ah, you little bitch, say this...

533
00:37:48,335 --> 00:37:52,119
Take a bath fast before you try
getting near me on stage.

534
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:54,607
Have that suit cleaned and burnt.

535
00:37:54,741 --> 00:37:56,142
Bitch, sadist!

536
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:05,666
Everybody's darling.

537
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:07,935
Story of a star before she happens

538
00:38:07,955 --> 00:38:09,221
as told to Richard Mudd

539
00:38:09,356 --> 00:38:13,558
friend, confidant, author,
television personality.

540
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:15,427
Fifth edition, chapter one

541
00:38:15,562 --> 00:38:19,965
in which we examine
what makes her tick. Youth.

542
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:24,285
- What is it?
- 'A letter for you.'

543
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:26,887
Slip it under the door,
and don't bother me.

544
00:38:26,907 --> 00:38:31,510
'Barbara is like'

545
00:38:31,646 --> 00:38:33,746
'any other girl..'

546
00:38:35,516 --> 00:38:37,817
Just more beautiful.

547
00:38:40,921 --> 00:38:42,054
The other girls hate Barbara

548
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:44,657
because she's always the prettiest.

549
00:38:46,593 --> 00:38:49,428
All the boys want to play with Barbara..

550
00:38:51,598 --> 00:38:52,698
...even..

551
00:38:56,603 --> 00:38:58,070
- Even..
- 'Even..'

552
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:01,940
Even Kurt Dougherty, a 53-year-old

553
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:04,810
albino hypnotherapist with a wooden leg.

554
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:07,946
Fifty-three-year-old albino hypnotherapist?

555
00:39:08,082 --> 00:39:09,082
With a wooden leg.

556
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,134
Friend of the family.

557
00:39:13,154 --> 00:39:14,887
- Caught you?
- Yes.

558
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:16,355
Thought so.

559
00:39:21,095 --> 00:39:23,696
Parents send Barbara away

560
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:26,765
to Halibut Hills Girls School.

561
00:41:16,343 --> 00:41:17,410
Catch you?

562
00:41:18,613 --> 00:41:19,613
Yes.

563
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,858
Ah, tell me now, what do you
think of Kurt Dougherty

564
00:42:05,993 --> 00:42:07,993
after all those years?

565
00:42:08,128 --> 00:42:09,862
I hate his guts

566
00:42:09,997 --> 00:42:12,331
along with every other male I've ever met.

567
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:16,535
Except for you, bunny.

568
00:42:19,273 --> 00:42:21,874
- You want to get some din-din?
- No.

569
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:23,942
I'm going home to go straight to bed.

570
00:42:24,078 --> 00:42:25,078
Okay.

571
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:28,180
Oh. Don't forget you letter.

572
00:42:31,352 --> 00:42:33,586
<i>- Ciao.
- Ciao.</i>

573
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,360
<i>Dear Barbara Darling</i>

574
00:42:41,496 --> 00:42:44,497
<i>I'm only an ordinary assistant
in a library.</i>

575
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:47,099
<i>But I saw the "Department Store" last night</i>

576
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:49,168
<i>and I haven't been able to forget you.</i>

577
00:42:50,705 --> 00:42:53,606
<i>Darling Bernard.</i>

578
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:58,359
<i>Well, what a sweet letter.</i>

579
00:42:58,379 --> 00:43:02,981
<i>I, uh, was very deeply touched.</i>

580
00:43:03,117 --> 00:43:05,317
<i>Why don't you come to the theater</i>

581
00:43:05,452 --> 00:43:08,053
<i>after the performance one night?</i>

582
00:43:08,189 --> 00:43:11,772
<i>The doorman will show you
where my dressing room is.</i>

583
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:15,660
<i>Of course, I'm not always dressed there.</i>

584
00:43:15,796 --> 00:43:17,530
Ha-ha.

585
00:43:22,537 --> 00:43:23,537
Love..

586
00:43:25,005 --> 00:43:26,672
...Barbara Darling.

587
00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:17,390
Hello, friend of my youth.

588
00:44:23,197 --> 00:44:24,797
Hello, tongue.

589
00:44:24,932 --> 00:44:25,998
Yuck!

590
00:44:43,751 --> 00:44:47,420
- You stink.
- I stink, therefore I am.

591
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:50,471
Good morning, Ms. Thing.
Are you feeling better?

592
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:52,424
- Your arm's okay?
- Yes. No, thank you.

593
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:54,427
Here's a letter from your mother.

594
00:45:01,568 --> 00:45:03,484
"Bernard love,
remember everything I told you.

595
00:45:03,504 --> 00:45:07,039
Here's a lock of my hair
to remind you. Mom."

596
00:45:07,174 --> 00:45:09,490
I always get hair from my mother.

597
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:10,750
Once I went away to summer camp

598
00:45:10,777 --> 00:45:12,511
she sent me enough to stuff a mattress.

599
00:45:12,647 --> 00:45:14,714
I thought she'd be bald when I got home.

600
00:45:16,651 --> 00:45:19,552
- I'm late for duty.
- Oh, don't forget your pistol.

601
00:45:21,121 --> 00:45:23,588
Mm, kind of perfumey to me.

602
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:25,440
I don't know whether
I ought to give this to you

603
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,326
without clearing it with your mother.

604
00:45:27,462 --> 00:45:29,176
- Another letter for me?
- Mm.

605
00:45:29,196 --> 00:45:31,312
Smelling in the same perfume

606
00:45:31,332 --> 00:45:32,665
you're soaked in.

607
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,715
This isn't perfume, it's aftershave lotion.

608
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:36,469
I spilled half a bottle of it on my shirt.

609
00:45:36,603 --> 00:45:39,138
It's the same perfume.

610
00:45:39,273 --> 00:45:40,939
I haven't smelled it yet.

611
00:45:41,075 --> 00:45:43,676
Lavender. Mm. Lovely lavender.

612
00:45:46,213 --> 00:45:48,280
- I forgot my gun.
- Ah.

613
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,197
He's helpless without me.

614
00:45:50,217 --> 00:45:51,884
Ms. Thing, the privacy of the mail

615
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:54,286
is guaranteed by federal law.

616
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:56,737
Well, at least tell me
who the letter's from.

617
00:45:56,757 --> 00:46:00,025
- BD. Guess who?
- Bad Democrats?

618
00:46:00,161 --> 00:46:01,794
- Ha-ha..
- Excuse me.

619
00:46:03,898 --> 00:46:06,231
Is this draft-card burner
giving you more trouble, ma'am?

620
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:08,433
Oh, no. It's alright, Francis.

621
00:46:08,569 --> 00:46:10,151
Because I've had experience
with this kind of kid.

622
00:46:10,171 --> 00:46:13,554
- No, thank you, Francis.
- I see these kids all day.

623
00:46:13,574 --> 00:46:17,410
- They all take LSD.
- Bye. Have a nice day.

624
00:46:22,249 --> 00:46:25,751
BD. Barbara Darling.

625
00:46:31,726 --> 00:46:33,259
Barbara Darling?

626
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:35,594
Please, Ms. Thing.

627
00:46:38,866 --> 00:46:42,649
- Cookie, Bernard?
- Thanks.

628
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:44,051
Please, can I have my letter?

629
00:46:44,071 --> 00:46:46,539
I think we ought to have a talk.

630
00:46:46,673 --> 00:46:49,456
I'll read and give it right back.

631
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:51,392
You have no idea what a pleasure it is

632
00:46:51,412 --> 00:46:54,947
for a lonely old woman to talk to you.

633
00:46:55,082 --> 00:46:56,916
Even if it's only for a minute.

634
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:01,153
There, I did it, didn't I?

635
00:47:01,288 --> 00:47:02,555
Did what?

636
00:47:02,689 --> 00:47:07,159
Admitted I was lonely... and old.

637
00:47:07,294 --> 00:47:10,563
Well, gosh, I'm lonely
and young. I'm always lonely.

638
00:47:10,697 --> 00:47:12,965
- Even when I'm with people.
- 'Oh.'

639
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,433
Especially when I'm with people.

640
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:16,602
You're a sweet boy, Bernard.

641
00:47:18,305 --> 00:47:19,704
And bright.

642
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,342
So I know you'll understand all
the advice I'm going to give.

643
00:47:24,378 --> 00:47:26,212
Here's your letter.

644
00:47:31,052 --> 00:47:33,319
Last week I was 19..

645
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:36,989
...today I'm 42.

646
00:47:37,124 --> 00:47:39,039
Hm.

647
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:42,762
If I had an eggshell
for every day I've spent alone..

648
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:46,799
...I'd, I'd, um..

649
00:47:46,934 --> 00:47:48,601
'You'd..'

650
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:51,670
I'd have a lot of eggshells.

651
00:47:53,407 --> 00:47:56,141
'It was different when I was your age.'

652
00:47:56,277 --> 00:48:00,446
'Our parents were strict,
so was my brother Gus.'

653
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:05,618
'I was never allowed to be alone with Bo.'

654
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:07,520
'Gus went everywhere.'

655
00:48:11,692 --> 00:48:13,540
'Well, it was part of a tradition'

656
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,928
'saving yourself for marriage.'

657
00:48:20,434 --> 00:48:21,500
Oh!

658
00:48:21,636 --> 00:48:24,351
'Here's me the next year'

659
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:26,839
'at Atlantic City.'

660
00:48:29,043 --> 00:48:30,643
Hm. Oh!

661
00:48:30,778 --> 00:48:34,880
Here's me the next year at Coney Island.

662
00:48:37,718 --> 00:48:39,852
Gus died.

663
00:48:39,987 --> 00:48:42,922
But his upbringing remained a part of me.

664
00:48:44,058 --> 00:48:45,458
So did his rooster.

665
00:48:49,464 --> 00:48:51,196
Oh, another cookie, Bernard?

666
00:48:51,332 --> 00:48:54,581
No. No, thanks. They were wonderful.

667
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:56,869
And your pictures were very good, too.

668
00:48:57,004 --> 00:48:58,337
I was wondering..

669
00:49:00,341 --> 00:49:02,607
...who took them?

670
00:49:02,743 --> 00:49:06,011
- Passing strangers.
- Oh.

671
00:49:06,147 --> 00:49:08,747
You see, you forgot all about your letter.

672
00:49:08,883 --> 00:49:12,551
Yeah, I, I guess I did.
I mean, it's from a girl.

673
00:49:12,687 --> 00:49:14,920
I-I guess I might as well
open it anyway, hm?

674
00:49:16,491 --> 00:49:17,804
Barbara Darling. Barbara Darling.

675
00:49:17,824 --> 00:49:21,142
Barbara Darling. Barbara Darling.

676
00:49:21,162 --> 00:49:22,627
"Darling Bernard.

677
00:49:22,763 --> 00:49:24,545
"My, what a sweet letter.
I was very deeply touched.

678
00:49:24,565 --> 00:49:25,612
"Why don't you come to the theater

679
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:26,952
"after the performance one night?

680
00:49:27,034 --> 00:49:28,615
"The doorman will show you
where my dressing room is

681
00:49:28,635 --> 00:49:29,768
though I'm not always dre.."

682
00:49:29,904 --> 00:49:31,752
- She's not always what?
- Uh..

683
00:49:31,772 --> 00:49:35,022
- I'm not always... there.
- Oh.

684
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:36,909
"Love, Barbara."

685
00:49:37,044 --> 00:49:39,311
Ms. Thing

686
00:49:39,446 --> 00:49:42,181
I got a letter from Barbara Darling.

687
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:45,384
- Oh. Oh..
- Oh. Oh..

688
00:49:50,191 --> 00:49:53,726
¶ You know there's things
you never thought before ¶

689
00:49:53,861 --> 00:49:57,244
¶ That have to do
with walkin' out old doors ¶

690
00:49:57,264 --> 00:50:01,734
¶ You've been prepared
as long as time allowed ¶

691
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:04,937
¶ Well I don't know how ¶

692
00:50:05,072 --> 00:50:08,255
¶ But you're a big boy now ¶
¶ You're a big boy now ¶

693
00:50:08,275 --> 00:50:11,544
¶ Come on and take a bow ¶
¶ You're a big boy now ¶

694
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:15,114
¶ 'Cause you're a big boy now ¶

695
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:22,555
¶ You know the girls
are taking notice of you ¶

696
00:50:22,689 --> 00:50:26,073
¶ They say your hair is getting curly too ¶

697
00:50:26,093 --> 00:50:29,410
¶ So shave today
you shave tomorrow as well ¶

698
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:33,832
¶ You're run by you
and not a class-room bell ¶

699
00:50:33,968 --> 00:50:36,969
¶ And I don't know how ¶

700
00:50:37,104 --> 00:50:42,289
¶ But you're a big boy now ¶
¶ You're a big boy now ¶

701
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:48,981
¶ And the great big world
daddy threw before you ¶

702
00:50:49,116 --> 00:50:55,388
¶ With the pretty faces
and the claws that tore you ¶

703
00:50:55,522 --> 00:51:02,061
¶ And it's all so different
when you get to sources ¶

704
00:51:02,196 --> 00:51:09,316
¶ And love will make you strong
as a team of wild horses ¶

705
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:10,469
I got a letter from Barbara!

706
00:51:10,605 --> 00:51:12,204
Barbara Darling, she sent it to me!

707
00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:14,940
¶ Things you never thought before ¶

708
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:18,644
¶ That have to do
with walkin' out old doors ¶¶

709
00:51:34,429 --> 00:51:37,830
¶ Girl beautiful girl ¶

710
00:51:37,965 --> 00:51:40,547
¶ Girl wrapped up in fur ¶¶

711
00:51:40,567 --> 00:51:45,438
<i>Darling Bernard, well, what a sweet letter.</i>

712
00:51:45,572 --> 00:51:47,706
<i>I'm not always dressed there.</i>

713
00:52:00,455 --> 00:52:03,255
Bernard, I wanna talk to you.

714
00:52:05,993 --> 00:52:08,108
'Put my son on.'

715
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:10,563
Sorry, but, you know,
it's your father again.

716
00:52:11,932 --> 00:52:14,933
Yes, dad. I mean, IH. I mean, father.

717
00:52:15,069 --> 00:52:16,935
'You're 75 minutes late, Bernard.'

718
00:52:17,071 --> 00:52:18,871
I'm very sorry, sir, but I have an excuse.

719
00:52:19,006 --> 00:52:21,206
- 'I'm listening.'
- Well..

720
00:52:21,342 --> 00:52:22,141
A very lonely lady wanted

721
00:52:22,276 --> 00:52:24,076
to talk to me and show me her pictures

722
00:52:24,211 --> 00:52:26,679
because she had nothing to show
for her life but eggshells.

723
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:28,280
'What is that supposed to mean?'

724
00:52:28,415 --> 00:52:30,331
Well, don't you see?

725
00:52:30,351 --> 00:52:32,485
Eggshells are empty.

726
00:52:33,954 --> 00:52:36,170
Dad, are you still in there?

727
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:37,190
Pop?

728
00:52:39,226 --> 00:52:43,562
Well, wire busted or a fuse blew
or a transistor transgressed.

729
00:52:47,568 --> 00:52:48,734
Ah!

730
00:52:50,237 --> 00:52:52,905
Uh, boy, you can use
your directional signal.

731
00:52:53,774 --> 00:52:55,041
Here.

732
00:52:56,511 --> 00:52:57,576
Have you talked to Amy?

733
00:52:57,712 --> 00:52:58,826
I haven't talked to anybody yet.

734
00:52:58,846 --> 00:52:59,712
I just got in.

735
00:52:59,847 --> 00:53:01,580
You devil!

736
00:53:01,716 --> 00:53:02,915
What happened, huh?

737
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:04,765
What happened what? Nothing happened.

738
00:53:04,785 --> 00:53:07,720
You know what I mean, Bernard. Come here.

739
00:53:11,726 --> 00:53:14,041
- Try one.
- What for? What is it?

740
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:16,929
- It's an aspirin.
- I haven't got a headache.

741
00:53:17,064 --> 00:53:18,998
Try it anyway. You'll like it.

742
00:53:21,802 --> 00:53:24,251
Now, shall we welcome you
into the fraternity, hm?

743
00:53:24,271 --> 00:53:27,054
What fraternity? It doesn't
taste like an aspirin to me.

744
00:53:27,074 --> 00:53:28,607
Fraternity of man, Bernard.

745
00:53:28,743 --> 00:53:30,057
Did you score with Amy Partlett or not?

746
00:53:30,077 --> 00:53:31,192
She was a sure thing.

747
00:53:31,212 --> 00:53:33,478
Now, why do you say a thing like that?

748
00:53:33,614 --> 00:53:35,796
- She is a nice person.
- Who? Amy?

749
00:53:35,816 --> 00:53:37,350
Well, don't be so sensitive, Bernard.

750
00:53:37,484 --> 00:53:39,251
You'd get a sunburn. Hm.

751
00:53:42,089 --> 00:53:44,423
Have some more, uh, aspirin.

752
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,959
I mean, I don't happen to think
she's a sure thing.

753
00:53:47,094 --> 00:53:48,609
I think she's a possible thing.

754
00:53:48,629 --> 00:53:51,096
But everybody's possible.
I mean, girl, sooner or later.

755
00:53:51,232 --> 00:53:52,765
Huh, boy, you're a saint from heaven.

756
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,900
Well, forget it.

757
00:53:55,035 --> 00:53:57,035
I have to go back to work.
I'm in trouble today.

758
00:53:57,171 --> 00:53:58,886
Yeah, well, you're in trouble
every day, lover boy.

759
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:00,087
Now, look, if you're not gonna
cooperate with me

760
00:54:00,107 --> 00:54:01,422
you're not gonna get anywhere.

761
00:54:01,442 --> 00:54:02,823
Maybe I don't wanna go
where you want me to get.

762
00:54:02,843 --> 00:54:05,426
You don't wanna be like me, a poet?

763
00:54:05,446 --> 00:54:06,912
Maybe not.

764
00:54:07,047 --> 00:54:08,695
Well, then you're never gonna
get to meet a girl

765
00:54:08,715 --> 00:54:12,717
like, uh, say, uh, Barbara Darling.

766
00:54:12,853 --> 00:54:15,988
Barbara Darling?

767
00:54:16,123 --> 00:54:17,704
You know, it's funny
you should mention her.

768
00:54:17,724 --> 00:54:19,106
I got a letter from her this morning.

769
00:54:19,126 --> 00:54:21,041
She wants me to drop by
at her dressing room tonight

770
00:54:21,061 --> 00:54:23,195
and kill some time. You know how it is.

771
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,134
What kind of aspirins are these anyway?

772
00:54:47,021 --> 00:54:48,353
'Hey, if you don't mind..'

773
00:54:51,158 --> 00:54:53,692
Hey, old buddy, if you don't mind..

774
00:54:53,828 --> 00:54:54,927
Ow!

775
00:54:57,765 --> 00:55:00,232
You were standing on my foot.

776
00:55:00,367 --> 00:55:01,700
Excuse me?

777
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:11,010
Come here.

778
00:55:18,585 --> 00:55:20,319
Who are you?

779
00:55:20,455 --> 00:55:22,355
Yeah. Who am I?

780
00:55:24,124 --> 00:55:26,773
I'm Bernard Chanticleer, Ms. Darling.

781
00:55:26,793 --> 00:55:29,776
- Good evening.
- Well, thank you.

782
00:55:29,796 --> 00:55:31,864
Happy New Year to you, too.

783
00:55:34,735 --> 00:55:38,137
You were the one who sent
that letter full of sugar to me?

784
00:55:38,272 --> 00:55:39,272
Yes, I..

785
00:55:53,488 --> 00:55:54,720
Bless you.

786
00:56:10,837 --> 00:56:12,238
Come on in, sugar.

787
00:56:14,575 --> 00:56:15,841
'Close the door.'

788
00:56:17,712 --> 00:56:19,045
Sure.

789
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:31,857
You like those coffin nails too much.

790
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,127
You better watch out.

791
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:38,898
Better not cough.

792
00:56:49,476 --> 00:56:51,010
Take off your jacket.

793
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:53,946
Relax.

794
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:15,968
Would you like a drink?

795
00:57:16,103 --> 00:57:19,019
- Coffee?
- Coffee?

796
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:21,040
Nope, no, a drink.

797
00:57:21,175 --> 00:57:23,042
Maybe better coffee.

798
00:57:23,177 --> 00:57:25,211
I mean, a drink of coffee.

799
00:57:27,114 --> 00:57:29,848
I know what's wrong with you.

800
00:57:29,984 --> 00:57:32,918
You would like a glass of milk.

801
00:57:34,121 --> 00:57:35,520
But you're afraid to ask for it

802
00:57:35,656 --> 00:57:38,524
because Barbara will think
you're a little boy.

803
00:57:39,994 --> 00:57:42,595
But it's alright.

804
00:57:42,729 --> 00:57:44,797
You can ask Barbara for a glass of milk

805
00:57:44,932 --> 00:57:47,233
and, and she'll bring it to you.

806
00:57:49,536 --> 00:57:50,936
Come on.

807
00:57:52,473 --> 00:57:55,608
Ask Barbara for a glass of milk.

808
00:57:55,743 --> 00:57:59,860
Say I want a glass of milk.

809
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,662
I want a glass of milk.

810
00:58:01,682 --> 00:58:03,482
You see?

811
00:58:03,618 --> 00:58:06,885
See how easy, sunshine, hm?

812
00:58:07,021 --> 00:58:09,888
Now, the Easter Bunny will pour you

813
00:58:10,024 --> 00:58:12,024
a little glass of milk.

814
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:15,895
It will be warm and nice..

815
00:58:17,498 --> 00:58:19,098
...and you know what.

816
00:58:21,836 --> 00:58:23,684
I don't know what.

817
00:58:23,704 --> 00:58:26,238
- What? What did you say, hon?
- Nothing.

818
00:58:26,373 --> 00:58:29,375
Just agreeing. I always agree.

819
00:59:00,341 --> 00:59:03,876
What the hell are you doing,
snooping around?

820
00:59:04,011 --> 00:59:05,326
You know, I only invited you here

821
00:59:05,346 --> 00:59:07,279
out of the goodness of my heart!

822
00:59:07,414 --> 00:59:09,081
Damn it, what are you, a conch?

823
00:59:09,216 --> 00:59:12,217
I wasn't snooping. I was just..
I don't know, it just happened.

824
00:59:12,353 --> 00:59:15,154
- Don't talk back to me.
- I'm sorry.

825
00:59:16,623 --> 00:59:17,923
It's alright.

826
00:59:20,027 --> 00:59:21,193
Sweetheart..

827
00:59:22,229 --> 00:59:24,745
'...here's your milk.'

828
00:59:24,765 --> 00:59:29,101
'Come sit with me and, and we'll talk.'

829
00:59:29,236 --> 00:59:31,236
- No.
- Why not?

830
00:59:31,372 --> 00:59:33,020
I'm pinned to the floor.

831
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:35,508
Bernard! My goodness!

832
00:59:35,642 --> 00:59:38,678
I didn't realize
you were pinned to the floor.

833
00:59:39,847 --> 00:59:40,979
You poor..

834
00:59:41,115 --> 00:59:42,848
There.

835
00:59:42,983 --> 00:59:44,383
Is that better?

836
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:51,456
Oh, uh, yes, honey. I'll take that.

837
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:53,258
Look, maybe I better get out of here.

838
00:59:53,394 --> 00:59:55,576
I mean, I know you weren't
expecting anybody like me.

839
00:59:55,596 --> 00:59:57,978
- 'And I'd rather... '
- You're perfect.

840
00:59:57,998 --> 00:59:59,046
Me?

841
00:59:59,066 --> 01:00:02,268
Absolutely hunky dory, perfect.

842
01:00:05,272 --> 01:00:07,440
You're just what I need in my life.

843
01:00:13,814 --> 01:00:15,414
Now open your mouth..

844
01:00:17,352 --> 01:00:19,185
...and drink your milk.

845
01:00:24,425 --> 01:00:25,458
Drink.

846
01:00:35,102 --> 01:00:38,819
One, two, unbutton the shoe.

847
01:00:38,839 --> 01:00:42,174
Three, four, open more.

848
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:45,510
Oh, Bernard, I've been
very worried about you.

849
01:00:45,646 --> 01:00:50,182
You know, you-you haven't been
at all well tonight.

850
01:00:50,317 --> 01:00:54,101
Now, darling, I don't want you to be tense

851
01:00:54,121 --> 01:00:56,122
or feel confined or..

852
01:00:57,592 --> 01:00:59,992
...or cramped or..

853
01:01:00,127 --> 01:01:01,460
...or anything.

854
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:03,930
Oh, gosh! Barb..

855
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:06,932
You're a little klutzy, aren't you?

856
01:01:07,067 --> 01:01:09,335
- Difficult age.
- Excuse me.

857
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:12,119
Uh, sorry.

858
01:01:12,139 --> 01:01:13,872
Never mind, hon.

859
01:01:14,008 --> 01:01:15,675
Mama taught me everything.

860
01:01:16,877 --> 01:01:18,377
Everything mama knew.

861
01:01:19,614 --> 01:01:23,015
Oh, sweetheart,
now you've got your pants in it.

862
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:25,532
Take them off, and I'll fix them for you.

863
01:01:25,552 --> 01:01:27,586
It's probably the only pair you've got.

864
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:45,805
I'll be back.

865
01:02:03,791 --> 01:02:05,791
¶ Come ¶

866
01:02:05,926 --> 01:02:10,463
¶ And talk of all the things we did today ¶

867
01:02:11,798 --> 01:02:13,780
¶ Here ¶

868
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:18,603
¶ And laugh about our funny little ways ¶

869
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:23,676
¶ While we have a few minutes to breathe ¶

870
01:02:23,811 --> 01:02:29,482
¶ Then I know
that it's time you must leave ¶

871
01:02:29,616 --> 01:02:33,152
¶ But darling be home soon ¶

872
01:02:33,287 --> 01:02:39,958
¶ I couldn't bear to wait
an extra minute if you dawdled ¶

873
01:02:40,094 --> 01:02:43,829
¶ My darling be home soon ¶

874
01:02:43,964 --> 01:02:46,165
¶ It's not just these few hours ¶

875
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:50,017
¶ But I've been waiting since I toddled ¶

876
01:02:50,037 --> 01:02:55,508
¶ For the great relief
of having you to talk to ¶

877
01:02:58,513 --> 01:03:00,913
¶ And now ¶

878
01:03:01,048 --> 01:03:05,918
¶ A quarter of my life is almost past ¶

879
01:03:06,053 --> 01:03:10,771
¶ I think I've come to see myself at last ¶

880
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:15,843
¶ And I see that the time spent confused ¶

881
01:03:15,863 --> 01:03:20,999
¶ Was the time that I spent without you ¶

882
01:03:21,135 --> 01:03:27,340
¶ And I feel myself in bloom ¶

883
01:03:28,543 --> 01:03:32,144
¶ So darling be home soon ¶

884
01:03:32,279 --> 01:03:38,599
¶ I couldn't bear to wait
an extra minute if you dawdled ¶

885
01:03:38,619 --> 01:03:42,403
¶ My darling be home soon ¶

886
01:03:42,423 --> 01:03:44,356
¶ It's not just these few hours ¶

887
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:48,075
¶ But I've been waiting since I toddled ¶

888
01:03:48,095 --> 01:03:53,366
¶ For the great relief
of having you to talk to ¶

889
01:04:15,856 --> 01:04:18,239
¶ So darling ¶

890
01:04:18,259 --> 01:04:21,860
¶ My darling be home soon ¶

891
01:04:21,996 --> 01:04:28,315
¶ I couldn't bear to wait
an extra minute if you dawdled ¶

892
01:04:28,335 --> 01:04:31,919
¶ My darling be home soon ¶

893
01:04:31,939 --> 01:04:33,806
¶ It's not just these few hours ¶

894
01:04:33,941 --> 01:04:37,676
¶ But I've been waiting since I toddled ¶

895
01:04:37,812 --> 01:04:42,882
¶ For the great relief
of having you to talk to ¶

896
01:04:46,086 --> 01:04:47,886
¶ Go ¶

897
01:04:48,022 --> 01:04:53,225
¶ And beat your crazy head
against the sky ¶

898
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,428
¶ Try ¶

899
01:04:55,562 --> 01:05:00,347
¶ And see beyond the houses and your eyes ¶

900
01:05:00,367 --> 01:05:04,285
¶ It's okay to shoot the moon ¶

901
01:05:04,305 --> 01:05:06,238
- What's that?
- Oh, sugar baby.

902
01:05:06,373 --> 01:05:09,775
Easter Bunny's got a wild headache.

903
01:05:11,312 --> 01:05:13,312
You don't mind.

904
01:05:13,448 --> 01:05:15,380
We'll sleep.

905
01:05:15,516 --> 01:05:18,117
I'll make it up to you in the morning.

906
01:05:18,252 --> 01:05:21,454
Okay? Pup.

907
01:05:21,588 --> 01:05:23,588
¶ It's not just these few hours ¶

908
01:05:23,724 --> 01:05:27,860
¶ But I've been waiting
since I toddled for the great ¶¶

909
01:05:27,995 --> 01:05:30,262
Well, what about the record player?

910
01:05:30,397 --> 01:05:32,365
Turns off all by itself.

911
01:05:51,418 --> 01:05:53,800
Bernie baby, don't be sad.

912
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:56,022
Barbara knows you tried your best.

913
01:05:57,624 --> 01:05:59,958
But your spirit was really not positive.

914
01:06:00,094 --> 01:06:01,094
Bye-bye.

915
01:06:21,448 --> 01:06:22,848
Del Grado.

916
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,720
Yes, IH?

917
01:06:26,854 --> 01:06:28,369
I need someone to help me in the vault.

918
01:06:28,389 --> 01:06:32,439
Uh, is Amy Partlett here?

919
01:06:32,459 --> 01:06:35,494
Uh, haven't seen her all morning, IH.

920
01:06:36,197 --> 01:06:37,496
She do?

921
01:06:39,534 --> 01:06:41,133
No, I'll manage.

922
01:06:48,743 --> 01:06:49,975
IH?

923
01:06:53,247 --> 01:06:54,813
Yes?

924
01:06:54,949 --> 01:06:57,616
There's a Ms. Thing here to see you.

925
01:06:57,752 --> 01:07:00,352
- Reference to what?
- Bernard. What else?

926
01:07:00,487 --> 01:07:05,157
Ah, I, uh, I am Bernard's landlady.

927
01:07:05,292 --> 01:07:08,809
Oh, yes, Ms. Thing with the arm.

928
01:07:08,829 --> 01:07:11,764
Ah, would you get my son, Del Grado? Yes.

929
01:07:11,899 --> 01:07:13,680
Mr. Chanticleer, there's something

930
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,482
I think you should know.

931
01:07:15,502 --> 01:07:17,684
- I'm listening.
- Hm!

932
01:07:17,704 --> 01:07:19,972
So is the world. Hm!

933
01:07:20,107 --> 01:07:22,241
- Mr. Chanticleer, last night...
- Oh..

934
01:07:23,911 --> 01:07:26,645
You shouldn't have done that,
Ms. Thing. This is a time vault.

935
01:07:26,781 --> 01:07:28,647
Well, be that as it may, I want you to know

936
01:07:28,783 --> 01:07:31,584
that I run a respectable
apartment building.

937
01:07:31,718 --> 01:07:34,186
Well, I run a respectable son.

938
01:07:34,321 --> 01:07:36,121
- Ha!
- What does that mean?

939
01:07:36,257 --> 01:07:38,906
Last night Bernard left all spruced up

940
01:07:38,926 --> 01:07:40,926
after supper. Then it began.

941
01:07:44,531 --> 01:07:46,565
Hey. Where you've been, lover boy?

942
01:07:47,802 --> 01:07:49,401
You've been up all night, haven't you?

943
01:07:49,536 --> 01:07:51,270
I know, I recognize the sign.

944
01:07:51,405 --> 01:07:54,407
Bloodshot, black rings

945
01:07:54,541 --> 01:07:57,009
worn out, bad posture.

946
01:07:57,144 --> 01:07:59,545
No doubt about it.
Bernard's growing up after all.

947
01:08:04,619 --> 01:08:06,619
If I had a boy, and if he got calls

948
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:08,754
from a girl every 15 minutes

949
01:08:08,889 --> 01:08:11,939
and he never came home at all,
out all night

950
01:08:11,959 --> 01:08:14,627
didn't even come back in
the morning to brush his teeth

951
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:17,945
ha, I suggest that he spent the night.. Ah!

952
01:08:17,965 --> 01:08:20,232
- What?
- The Lord save me.

953
01:08:20,367 --> 01:08:24,685
- What is it?
- Oh, that filthy thing. Oh..

954
01:08:24,705 --> 01:08:27,039
Oh, yes, one of the finest examples

955
01:08:27,174 --> 01:08:29,690
of incunabulum collections. Very rare.

956
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:32,645
I'll thank you to keep
your incunabula to yourself.

957
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:35,781
Oh, my God!

958
01:08:35,916 --> 01:08:38,851
- Your father wants to see you.
- Thanks for telling me.

959
01:08:38,986 --> 01:08:41,721
- You know, I know your trouble.
- You do?

960
01:08:46,461 --> 01:08:47,726
- Take a whiff.
- What for?

961
01:08:47,862 --> 01:08:49,176
It'll clear up your sinus.

962
01:08:49,196 --> 01:08:51,063
- Take you on a trip.
- I've been on it.

963
01:08:51,198 --> 01:08:52,878
Sure, but you're not enjoying it, are you?

964
01:08:52,933 --> 01:08:55,868
- Enjoy what?
- Anything.

965
01:08:56,003 --> 01:08:58,671
You don't put your soul into it, Bernard.

966
01:08:58,806 --> 01:09:01,588
Now, for God's sake,
if you wanna be sinful, fine.

967
01:09:01,608 --> 01:09:05,511
If you wanna have a mistress,
fine. But enjoy it.

968
01:09:07,081 --> 01:09:08,547
Bye, lover boy.

969
01:09:11,018 --> 01:09:12,533
Open this door immediately.

970
01:09:12,553 --> 01:09:15,688
Yes, but, uh, the door won't open.

971
01:09:15,823 --> 01:09:18,757
Not for another three-and-a-half minutes.

972
01:09:18,893 --> 01:09:21,093
- Now..
- Oh, trapped.

973
01:09:21,228 --> 01:09:23,962
Trapped in the pornography
collection of a fiend.

974
01:09:24,098 --> 01:09:27,099
We have every reason to believe
that this door will open

975
01:09:27,234 --> 01:09:31,203
in three minutes, five seconds now.

976
01:09:33,508 --> 01:09:34,807
Oh..

977
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:46,919
Hey, will somebody
shut this thing off, please?

978
01:09:50,591 --> 01:09:51,957
Hey, the milk machine.

979
01:09:52,927 --> 01:09:55,194
Bernard, I have to talk to you.

980
01:09:55,329 --> 01:09:56,795
Hi, Amy.

981
01:09:56,931 --> 01:09:58,645
- Where have you been?
- Oh, I've been out.

982
01:09:58,665 --> 01:10:02,267
I tried to call you all
last night, every 15 minutes.

983
01:10:02,403 --> 01:10:04,585
Some old lady
kept calling me terrible names.

984
01:10:04,605 --> 01:10:06,539
Just keep your incunabula
and stay where you are.

985
01:10:06,673 --> 01:10:09,542
Please, calm yourself.
I assure you, my intentions...

986
01:10:09,676 --> 01:10:11,276
Intentions? I know about intentions.

987
01:10:11,412 --> 01:10:13,879
My brother told me all about men
and their intentions.

988
01:10:14,014 --> 01:10:15,654
Bernard, you're not even listening to me.

989
01:10:15,682 --> 01:10:17,682
I'm listening. I'm just having
a little trouble.

990
01:10:17,818 --> 01:10:19,418
You like milk?

991
01:10:19,554 --> 01:10:21,268
Bernard, come and sit down with me.

992
01:10:21,288 --> 01:10:24,190
- You can tell me here.
- Okay, listen.

993
01:10:25,492 --> 01:10:27,860
Your father made a pass at me.

994
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:32,231
Stop or I'll kill you, I swear it!

995
01:10:32,366 --> 01:10:34,567
Oh! Ms. Thing, please.

996
01:10:34,701 --> 01:10:36,969
That's "Ovid's Ars Amores."

997
01:10:42,509 --> 01:10:43,909
It was terrible!

998
01:10:44,044 --> 01:10:46,178
- My poor mother.
- Poor me!

999
01:10:46,313 --> 01:10:47,846
'Calm down, Amy.'

1000
01:10:47,982 --> 01:10:49,897
Hey, will somebody
shut this thing off? Please!

1001
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:51,832
Bernard, don't you care about me at all?

1002
01:10:51,852 --> 01:10:53,786
I care!

1003
01:10:53,921 --> 01:10:55,588
Let's get out of here.

1004
01:10:55,722 --> 01:10:59,458
Three, two, one. Whammo!

1005
01:11:04,531 --> 01:11:07,332
You degenerate! You maniac. Mani..

1006
01:11:15,342 --> 01:11:16,976
Father?

1007
01:11:18,012 --> 01:11:19,178
Ah..

1008
01:11:21,215 --> 01:11:23,349
That will be all, Del Grado.

1009
01:11:34,629 --> 01:11:36,829
Well, where were you last night?

1010
01:11:36,964 --> 01:11:38,479
- Out.
- Don't play games with me.

1011
01:11:38,499 --> 01:11:40,399
Big boy, where were you?

1012
01:11:44,905 --> 01:11:47,239
I remember when you found
the Gutenberg Bible

1013
01:11:47,374 --> 01:11:49,775
for the library.

1014
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:51,710
I saved the newspaper article.

1015
01:11:51,846 --> 01:11:53,913
What are you talking about, Bernard?

1016
01:11:54,915 --> 01:11:56,916
I thought that was terrific.

1017
01:12:03,858 --> 01:12:05,124
'Bernard!'

1018
01:12:06,461 --> 01:12:07,993
Bernard, come back here!

1019
01:12:21,476 --> 01:12:23,476
Barbara.

1020
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:26,945
Phone booth? You spend your time
in phone booths?

1021
01:12:27,081 --> 01:12:28,481
No, I didn't wanna go in.

1022
01:12:32,086 --> 01:12:34,086
Why do you have to work there?

1023
01:12:34,221 --> 01:12:37,338
Everybody looks up your dress.
Don't you feel guilty?

1024
01:12:37,358 --> 01:12:40,541
Look, Bernie baby,
I haven't known you too long

1025
01:12:40,561 --> 01:12:43,963
but it seems to me that you're
getting to be a regular noodge.

1026
01:12:45,966 --> 01:12:48,433
Remember when you wrote
that sweet letter to me?

1027
01:12:48,569 --> 01:12:51,704
I thought you'd be a person
that would be fun to be with.

1028
01:13:00,715 --> 01:13:02,014
There.

1029
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:06,033
There, never mind.

1030
01:13:06,053 --> 01:13:09,088
Barbara's here and-and she won't be cruel.

1031
01:13:10,191 --> 01:13:11,772
Hm?

1032
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:13,059
Better?

1033
01:13:16,063 --> 01:13:17,263
Better.

1034
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,049
Tell you what, sunshine?

1035
01:13:22,069 --> 01:13:24,785
You go to your little room
and get all your things

1036
01:13:24,805 --> 01:13:26,806
and bring them back to my place.

1037
01:13:28,342 --> 01:13:30,008
Your place?

1038
01:13:30,144 --> 01:13:32,860
You're gonna stay with me from now on.

1039
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,380
How would that be? Huh?

1040
01:13:35,416 --> 01:13:36,449
You mean it?

1041
01:13:37,552 --> 01:13:40,018
Oh, Bernard, you know I mean it.

1042
01:13:55,236 --> 01:13:58,304
"And good riddance. Ms. Nora Thing."

1043
01:14:09,116 --> 01:14:12,251
"Bernard.. Love, mother."

1044
01:14:30,871 --> 01:14:32,805
Barbara, I'm here.

1045
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:35,808
'Bernie, put your things away.'

1046
01:14:35,943 --> 01:14:39,011
'I've-I've made room
in the medicine cabinet.'

1047
01:14:39,146 --> 01:14:40,980
'I'll be out in a second.'

1048
01:15:02,436 --> 01:15:03,469
I'm here.

1049
01:15:14,181 --> 01:15:16,515
- What's this?
- My mother.

1050
01:15:16,651 --> 01:15:17,898
No.

1051
01:15:17,918 --> 01:15:20,719
What's this? Hair? You collect hair?

1052
01:15:20,855 --> 01:15:24,023
No. She sends it to me in letters.

1053
01:15:25,726 --> 01:15:27,927
Who are you anyhow?

1054
01:15:29,796 --> 01:15:31,396
But, Barbara, you said..

1055
01:15:31,532 --> 01:15:33,780
Just get this junk the hell out of here.

1056
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,783
What do you think you're doing? Moving in?

1057
01:15:36,803 --> 01:15:39,472
I don't need a klutz like you
moving in here for.

1058
01:15:39,606 --> 01:15:40,606
You dumb cunt.

1059
01:15:40,741 --> 01:15:42,789
Now, I don't wanna see you hanging around

1060
01:15:42,809 --> 01:15:46,411
or bothering me,
following me around places.

1061
01:15:46,547 --> 01:15:48,014
You understand?

1062
01:15:49,416 --> 01:15:51,584
And take your hair and get out of my life.

1063
01:16:01,828 --> 01:16:03,262
'Bernard?'

1064
01:16:07,902 --> 01:16:10,302
'Bernard, sweet cookie.'

1065
01:16:10,437 --> 01:16:14,621
'You're all Barbara has
in this cold, cold world.'

1066
01:16:14,641 --> 01:16:16,575
'Barbara needs you.'

1067
01:16:18,445 --> 01:16:21,762
Baby, don't leave me now.

1068
01:16:21,782 --> 01:16:24,050
Sweetheart, come up here.

1069
01:16:28,322 --> 01:16:30,189
It's going to be a cold night tonight

1070
01:16:30,324 --> 01:16:32,992
and your baby needs you, honeycomb.

1071
01:16:34,661 --> 01:16:36,995
I need you, baby.

1072
01:16:37,131 --> 01:16:40,032
I need you to come up here
and stay with me.

1073
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:44,403
Come up here!

1074
01:16:47,007 --> 01:16:49,342
Just come up here right now!

1075
01:17:26,581 --> 01:17:28,014
Bernie-comb.

1076
01:17:29,716 --> 01:17:31,384
What are you doing?

1077
01:17:33,254 --> 01:17:36,555
Honey? Honey, you're not to blame.

1078
01:17:37,658 --> 01:17:40,307
After all, you, you're very young

1079
01:17:40,327 --> 01:17:44,663
and-and you can't be expected
to just rush into things.

1080
01:17:44,799 --> 01:17:48,534
I mean, well, in time, anything can happen.

1081
01:17:49,404 --> 01:17:51,470
Well..

1082
01:17:51,606 --> 01:17:56,457
You might meet some sweet-natured girl.

1083
01:17:56,477 --> 01:18:00,679
Sweet-natured and patient girl.

1084
01:18:00,815 --> 01:18:02,481
And you'd make her as happy

1085
01:18:02,617 --> 01:18:06,619
as happy as a sweet-natured,
patient girl could expect to be.

1086
01:18:08,889 --> 01:18:11,957
I mean, I don't think
it's anything serious.

1087
01:18:12,092 --> 01:18:14,193
Although, maybe you ought to see a doctor.

1088
01:18:16,763 --> 01:18:17,763
Barbara..

1089
01:18:18,966 --> 01:18:20,366
...would you..

1090
01:18:21,502 --> 01:18:23,269
Would you marry me?

1091
01:18:30,978 --> 01:18:33,446
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

1092
01:18:37,318 --> 01:18:40,720
Marriage is not just
the meeting of two minds.

1093
01:18:41,922 --> 01:18:43,789
It's much more, really.

1094
01:18:45,592 --> 01:18:49,728
I mean, do you think that you are

1095
01:18:49,864 --> 01:18:52,480
or ever would be ready?

1096
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:54,715
I, I...

1097
01:18:54,735 --> 01:18:56,268
Will to have sex?

1098
01:18:58,139 --> 01:19:00,506
What's wrong with me?

1099
01:19:03,678 --> 01:19:06,312
Nothing that a firing squad couldn't fix.

1100
01:19:09,484 --> 01:19:11,999
Won't you try to take
a little alphabet soup, ma'am?

1101
01:19:12,019 --> 01:19:13,019
It's nice and hot.

1102
01:19:14,621 --> 01:19:16,603
Just tell me what happened.
Who did it to ya?

1103
01:19:16,623 --> 01:19:18,223
Oh, oh, oh.

1104
01:19:21,562 --> 01:19:22,562
Oh..

1105
01:19:26,167 --> 01:19:27,666
Oh, excuse me.

1106
01:19:29,970 --> 01:19:33,305
Uh, isn't this Ms. Thing's building?

1107
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,973
- Yeah, this is her room here.
- Oh!

1108
01:19:35,109 --> 01:19:38,110
But you can't see no one
on account of she's hysterical.

1109
01:19:38,245 --> 01:19:41,380
'Tell them to go away, whoever they are.'

1110
01:19:41,516 --> 01:19:44,116
- 'Who are they?'
- Oh, it's Margery Chanticleer.

1111
01:19:44,251 --> 01:19:45,918
And I came to get my boy.

1112
01:19:46,053 --> 01:19:49,388
'Oh, that poor woman. Let her come in.'

1113
01:19:51,658 --> 01:19:54,126
Please give Bernard back to me immediately.

1114
01:19:54,261 --> 01:19:57,578
I gave Bernard back to you yesterday.

1115
01:19:57,598 --> 01:19:59,998
Francis put all his things in the hallway

1116
01:20:00,134 --> 01:20:01,667
and he took them with him.

1117
01:20:03,871 --> 01:20:05,003
Dog!

1118
01:20:05,139 --> 01:20:07,272
Dog, you're what I need.

1119
01:20:19,486 --> 01:20:22,355
Well, why didn't you call me
when he stayed out all night?

1120
01:20:22,489 --> 01:20:24,223
I thought it was something

1121
01:20:24,358 --> 01:20:28,075
Mr. Chanticleer ought
to know about, and he..

1122
01:20:28,095 --> 01:20:31,163
Oh, you poor woman. Oh..

1123
01:20:34,101 --> 01:20:36,335
'Oh! Oh!'

1124
01:20:37,704 --> 01:20:39,572
She's been like this ever since yesterday.

1125
01:20:39,706 --> 01:20:42,507
- 'Oh..'
- Hysterical!

1126
01:20:42,643 --> 01:20:46,645
I want to know where my son is.
I must know where he is.

1127
01:20:46,781 --> 01:20:48,629
Then you should ask the little tramp

1128
01:20:48,649 --> 01:20:50,649
he's been spending his nights with.

1129
01:20:50,785 --> 01:20:51,884
Oh..

1130
01:20:55,456 --> 01:20:57,990
- Bernard?
- Who is she?

1131
01:20:59,526 --> 01:21:00,659
Do you remember her name?

1132
01:21:00,795 --> 01:21:02,995
What did she look like? Was she pretty?

1133
01:21:03,130 --> 01:21:05,564
She was older than him, wasn't she?

1134
01:21:07,001 --> 01:21:10,651
She called that night
he stayed out every 15 minutes.

1135
01:21:10,671 --> 01:21:12,653
She gave me her name and number.

1136
01:21:12,673 --> 01:21:15,256
I wrote it on the wall by the phone.

1137
01:21:15,276 --> 01:21:17,258
I'll show you.

1138
01:21:17,278 --> 01:21:18,811
Francis.

1139
01:21:20,815 --> 01:21:23,464
"Police department, fire department

1140
01:21:23,484 --> 01:21:25,350
uh, vice squad."

1141
01:21:25,486 --> 01:21:27,534
Uh, oh, here it is!

1142
01:21:27,554 --> 01:21:30,956
"A-X-4-9-9-5-0.

1143
01:21:31,091 --> 01:21:33,892
Amy Partlett."

1144
01:21:38,766 --> 01:21:40,633
- Who are you?
- Me? I'm nobody.

1145
01:21:40,768 --> 01:21:43,550
Where is my son? Give Bernard back to me.

1146
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:45,410
- I don't know where Bernard is.
- She's lying.

1147
01:21:45,506 --> 01:21:47,087
- Are you lying, miss?
- Honest, officer.

1148
01:21:47,107 --> 01:21:49,975
I don't know a thing. I was just
looking for Bernard myself.

1149
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:51,110
Oh, come now.

1150
01:21:51,178 --> 01:21:54,094
You're not the sort of girl
you'd call ignorant.

1151
01:21:54,114 --> 01:21:56,563
Why, you're the girl who works
in my husband's office.

1152
01:21:56,583 --> 01:21:58,784
- Heh-heh. Figures.
- Gee, Mrs. Chanticleer.

1153
01:21:58,919 --> 01:22:02,387
I'm really worried about Bernard.

1154
01:22:02,523 --> 01:22:03,971
I don't you know
whether I'm coming or going.

1155
01:22:03,991 --> 01:22:05,906
Going, if I have anything to say about it.

1156
01:22:05,926 --> 01:22:10,311
I am going to talk to my husband
immediately, Ms. Partlett.

1157
01:22:10,331 --> 01:22:12,898
- About you!
- Me?

1158
01:22:16,403 --> 01:22:17,403
Uh..

1159
01:22:22,409 --> 01:22:25,526
Well, if you're composed now, ma'am

1160
01:22:25,546 --> 01:22:27,946
I'll be gettin' down to the precinct.

1161
01:22:28,082 --> 01:22:29,997
- Francis...
- I don't feel too good..

1162
01:22:30,017 --> 01:22:31,817
About leaving you alone.

1163
01:22:31,952 --> 01:22:33,752
I mean, if there was a violation
of some sort

1164
01:22:33,888 --> 01:22:35,554
committed against your person

1165
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:37,222
the best thing would be to relate it

1166
01:22:37,358 --> 01:22:40,292
to your nearest police officer.

1167
01:22:40,427 --> 01:22:41,694
Which is me.

1168
01:22:41,828 --> 01:22:44,730
Which is you.

1169
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,066
Besides, I've got a..

1170
01:22:48,435 --> 01:22:49,902
...personal interest.

1171
01:22:51,038 --> 01:22:52,905
Do you, Francis?

1172
01:22:57,578 --> 01:22:58,959
I better go.

1173
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:00,427
Gonna be late getting back to dirty..

1174
01:23:00,447 --> 01:23:01,547
Oh, duty.

1175
01:23:03,984 --> 01:23:05,450
Francis.

1176
01:23:07,454 --> 01:23:11,172
If, uh, if I told you

1177
01:23:11,192 --> 01:23:13,058
that at my age

1178
01:23:13,194 --> 01:23:18,063
a man still found me attractive

1179
01:23:18,199 --> 01:23:20,265
uh, what would you think?

1180
01:23:20,401 --> 01:23:22,383
Well, I think you're..

1181
01:23:22,403 --> 01:23:24,651
Yes, attractive. Sure!

1182
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:27,654
Well, uh, more than attractive.

1183
01:23:27,674 --> 01:23:31,592
Uh... desirable?

1184
01:23:31,612 --> 01:23:33,594
Desirable enough that a, a man

1185
01:23:33,614 --> 01:23:36,481
with position and family

1186
01:23:36,617 --> 01:23:38,799
would throw it all out the window

1187
01:23:38,819 --> 01:23:40,986
just because I was, um..

1188
01:23:43,424 --> 01:23:46,473
...so desirable.

1189
01:23:46,493 --> 01:23:48,809
Well, I can appreciate that, ma'am.

1190
01:23:48,829 --> 01:23:51,011
I can remember telling your late brother

1191
01:23:51,031 --> 01:23:53,214
"Your sister," I said, "your sister..."

1192
01:23:53,234 --> 01:23:54,967
To hell with my brother.

1193
01:23:55,102 --> 01:23:57,284
Just tell me what you as a policeman

1194
01:23:57,304 --> 01:23:59,372
think of me as a woman.

1195
01:24:12,653 --> 01:24:15,788
Rover has been stolen!

1196
01:24:15,923 --> 01:24:18,705
Oh, my God! My God!

1197
01:24:18,725 --> 01:24:20,707
Rover has been stolen!

1198
01:24:20,727 --> 01:24:24,196
I've looked at her as an ideal,
too good to touch.

1199
01:24:24,331 --> 01:24:26,113
That's been my problem.

1200
01:24:26,133 --> 01:24:27,714
But she is only a woman.

1201
01:24:27,734 --> 01:24:31,136
And I'm a man.
I've got to keep that in mind.

1202
01:24:31,272 --> 01:24:33,520
First thing is that I need a key.

1203
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:35,474
I need a key, I'll tell her.

1204
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:38,744
- I need a key...
- Oh, I, come on in, lover boy.

1205
01:24:38,879 --> 01:24:40,527
What are you doing here?

1206
01:24:40,547 --> 01:24:43,015
I came to get you,
at your father's request.

1207
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:44,465
What would you like to drink, Bernard?

1208
01:24:44,485 --> 01:24:46,885
You drink, uh, milk, right?

1209
01:24:47,021 --> 01:24:49,270
- Milk.
- Where's Barbara?

1210
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:51,556
Well, Barbara isn't exactly in a position

1211
01:24:51,692 --> 01:24:53,859
to receive guests right now.

1212
01:24:55,296 --> 01:24:57,162
Barbara!

1213
01:24:58,565 --> 01:25:00,432
Barbsy baby!

1214
01:25:00,567 --> 01:25:01,482
'Hm?'

1215
01:25:01,502 --> 01:25:03,436
Bernie-combs is here to see you.

1216
01:25:06,507 --> 01:25:08,607
Bernard, how are you?

1217
01:25:09,977 --> 01:25:11,576
Oh, you and Raef are good friends.

1218
01:25:11,712 --> 01:25:13,979
I-I didn't know that.

1219
01:25:14,114 --> 01:25:16,563
Barbsy and I are now good friends.

1220
01:25:16,583 --> 01:25:17,950
Yes.

1221
01:25:19,386 --> 01:25:20,853
I'll get my things.

1222
01:25:25,392 --> 01:25:26,992
Bernard's upset!

1223
01:25:27,127 --> 01:25:30,663
Poor Bernard! Cry little, Bernard.

1224
01:25:30,797 --> 01:25:32,798
Bernard, why are you gettin' so..

1225
01:25:34,869 --> 01:25:37,069
Don't forget mother's hair.

1226
01:25:41,408 --> 01:25:42,675
Bernard.

1227
01:25:45,546 --> 01:25:47,012
I won't be needing this now.

1228
01:25:47,148 --> 01:25:48,595
I thought you'd like it as a souvenir.

1229
01:25:48,615 --> 01:25:50,082
I don't want it.

1230
01:25:50,217 --> 01:25:51,999
I'm not gonna leave here
screaming and furious

1231
01:25:52,019 --> 01:25:54,401
because I think you'd like that.

1232
01:25:54,421 --> 01:25:56,722
That's why you wanted me here
in the first place.

1233
01:25:57,892 --> 01:26:00,092
I'm gonna leave here calmly

1234
01:26:00,227 --> 01:26:02,495
wishing the two of you great luck

1235
01:26:02,629 --> 01:26:05,346
because of the millions
of people you could have found

1236
01:26:05,366 --> 01:26:07,614
you found each other.

1237
01:26:07,634 --> 01:26:09,035
'And you deserve each other.'

1238
01:26:14,975 --> 01:26:15,975
Bye.

1239
01:26:17,512 --> 01:26:19,178
Come, Dog.

1240
01:26:24,051 --> 01:26:25,518
Dog!

1241
01:26:45,672 --> 01:26:47,072
Humphrey, Humphrey

1242
01:26:47,208 --> 01:26:48,856
will you please tell her that she's fired?

1243
01:26:48,876 --> 01:26:50,516
- I've heard enough from her.
- Yes, dear.

1244
01:26:50,611 --> 01:26:53,546
I told Mrs. Chanticleer that I
was just looking for him myself.

1245
01:26:56,016 --> 01:26:57,865
Really, I think you ought
to call the police stations

1246
01:26:57,885 --> 01:26:58,866
and the hospitals.

1247
01:26:58,886 --> 01:27:00,152
What are you talking about?

1248
01:27:00,287 --> 01:27:02,269
He's not in a hospital.

1249
01:27:02,289 --> 01:27:05,157
Humphrey, please,
tell her that she is fired.

1250
01:27:05,292 --> 01:27:07,274
She's just making a suggestion, dear.

1251
01:27:07,294 --> 01:27:09,094
Oh, we don't need her suggestion.

1252
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:12,431
- You are fired!
- Why? I didn't do anything.

1253
01:27:14,101 --> 01:27:15,568
You have the nerve to fire me?

1254
01:27:15,702 --> 01:27:17,836
Ah, don't say anything rash.

1255
01:27:17,972 --> 01:27:20,172
Just remain quiet, calm

1256
01:27:20,307 --> 01:27:22,623
and carefully consider
that if you were to resign

1257
01:27:22,643 --> 01:27:25,510
that it might be possible
to find you a better job.

1258
01:27:25,646 --> 01:27:27,712
Oh, Bernard!

1259
01:27:27,848 --> 01:27:29,181
- Bernard...
- No, don't grab me.

1260
01:27:29,316 --> 01:27:31,650
- Bernard, are you alright?
- Yes, I am, thank you.

1261
01:27:31,786 --> 01:27:33,252
But I haven't much time.

1262
01:27:33,387 --> 01:27:35,654
Daddy, mummy..

1263
01:27:38,125 --> 01:27:39,458
- I'm leaving.
- Leaving?

1264
01:27:39,594 --> 01:27:40,674
What are you talking about?

1265
01:27:40,795 --> 01:27:41,976
- Where are you going, big boy?
- Well..

1266
01:27:41,996 --> 01:27:43,395
I'm not sure yet.

1267
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:44,729
But I'm leaving today.

1268
01:27:44,865 --> 01:27:46,331
Where I go will be my own choice.

1269
01:27:46,467 --> 01:27:51,452
Oh! Well, we could all
spend a week on Cape Cod.

1270
01:27:51,472 --> 01:27:53,138
Come on, my little baby.

1271
01:27:53,274 --> 01:27:55,274
Look, we can forget all our troubles

1272
01:27:55,409 --> 01:27:56,609
in the sea, in the sky.

1273
01:27:56,743 --> 01:27:58,277
Just daddy and mommy

1274
01:27:58,412 --> 01:27:59,660
and my baby.

1275
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:00,813
You'll love Cape Cod.

1276
01:28:00,948 --> 01:28:02,748
We'll go swimming every day...

1277
01:28:02,883 --> 01:28:05,084
I hate Cape Cod!

1278
01:28:05,219 --> 01:28:06,752
I don't wanna go anywhere with you.

1279
01:28:06,887 --> 01:28:10,089
I wanna get away from you.

1280
01:28:10,224 --> 01:28:14,026
- I'll take Dog.
- Well, Rover is gone forever.

1281
01:28:14,161 --> 01:28:17,096
- Someone stole him!
- His name is Dog!

1282
01:28:17,231 --> 01:28:19,098
D-O-G, Dog!

1283
01:28:19,233 --> 01:28:22,349
He's my dog and that's what
I chose to name him. Dog!

1284
01:28:22,369 --> 01:28:24,369
I could have named him Rover or Spot

1285
01:28:24,505 --> 01:28:27,354
or Fighter or anything,
but I didn't. I named him Dog!

1286
01:28:27,374 --> 01:28:30,175
Excuse me, IH, but I just found
Bernard's dog, Rover.

1287
01:28:30,311 --> 01:28:32,359
And where have you been
all this morning, Del Grado?

1288
01:28:32,379 --> 01:28:34,713
- You're fired!
- Dog!

1289
01:28:36,183 --> 01:28:38,117
Bernard!

1290
01:28:38,252 --> 01:28:40,252
You left some of your things at my place.

1291
01:28:40,387 --> 01:28:43,055
What were his things doing in your place?

1292
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:46,726
Well, uh, he spent
a few nights there with me.

1293
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,967
You're Bernard's mother.

1294
01:28:56,203 --> 01:28:58,337
I recognize you from your hair.

1295
01:29:00,607 --> 01:29:01,707
You..

1296
01:29:02,743 --> 01:29:04,343
You slut!

1297
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:08,013
Please, would you mind
apologizing to my wife-to-be?

1298
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:11,398
- Are you Chanticleer?
- No, please, please.

1299
01:29:11,418 --> 01:29:13,486
- You're gonna marry her?
- Let go of my husband!

1300
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:17,556
You degenerate! And to think
you're also a public servant.

1301
01:29:17,692 --> 01:29:19,024
True marriage of mind and body.

1302
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:22,409
- Let go of him!
- Alright, Francis.

1303
01:29:22,429 --> 01:29:26,631
Let him go! I told you I got out
before he could attack me.

1304
01:29:26,767 --> 01:29:29,702
Oh.. Oh-oh!

1305
01:29:31,372 --> 01:29:32,838
Margery, your lint is settling

1306
01:29:32,973 --> 01:29:34,955
on the Gutenberg Bible.

1307
01:29:34,975 --> 01:29:37,042
To hell with your Gutenberg Bible.

1308
01:29:37,178 --> 01:29:39,244
- I hate your Gutenberg Bible!
- Oh, Bernard!

1309
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:41,228
No! Bernard, no! Someone stop him!

1310
01:29:41,248 --> 01:29:43,030
Del Grado, you're hired! Stop him!

1311
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:45,650
Right! Hey, you, stop!

1312
01:30:09,476 --> 01:30:10,675
Bernard!

1313
01:30:17,218 --> 01:30:18,351
Big boy!

1314
01:30:19,754 --> 01:30:22,621
Bring back my Bible, big boy!

1315
01:30:33,234 --> 01:30:35,901
Bernie! Bernie-comb!

1316
01:30:46,581 --> 01:30:47,646
Rover, come on!

1317
01:31:01,796 --> 01:31:04,930
'Good afternoon, shoppers,
we are indeed having some..'

1318
01:31:08,002 --> 01:31:10,068
'Please be sure..'

1319
01:31:19,747 --> 01:31:21,880
Come on! Rover!

1320
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:28,087
'...on the fourth floor'

1321
01:31:28,222 --> 01:31:31,023
'and men's department on the fifth floor.'

1322
01:31:35,562 --> 01:31:36,562
Ah!

1323
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:41,834
Rover, I order you.

1324
01:32:02,189 --> 01:32:06,058
Barbara is famous now!

1325
01:32:06,193 --> 01:32:09,576
Who is this darling Barbara Darling

1326
01:32:09,596 --> 01:32:12,998
who hit a rare-book thief over
the head with a mannequin leg

1327
01:32:13,133 --> 01:32:17,870
and saved the Gutenberg Bible
for the city of New York?

1328
01:32:18,005 --> 01:32:21,407
And who's this Raef del Grado
poet she's gonna marry?

1329
01:32:25,412 --> 01:32:27,394
That's right.

1330
01:32:27,414 --> 01:32:29,730
Who are you?

1331
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:33,418
Me? I'm Raef. You love me, remember?

1332
01:32:33,554 --> 01:32:37,404
Barbara Darling, the lovely young actress.

1333
01:32:37,424 --> 01:32:39,224
- Hey, me...
- Whose autobiography..

1334
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:41,360
Me, Barbara, what about me?

1335
01:32:43,564 --> 01:32:44,630
Get lost.

1336
01:33:08,189 --> 01:33:10,455
- Out you go.
- Why?

1337
01:33:10,591 --> 01:33:13,159
You're out in custody.
Your bail's been paid.

1338
01:33:17,131 --> 01:33:19,331
I've been in the custody of my parents

1339
01:33:19,466 --> 01:33:22,535
for almost 20 years now.

1340
01:33:22,669 --> 01:33:26,138
And they have taught me
nothing but self-doubt

1341
01:33:26,273 --> 01:33:30,409
frustration and perpetual guilt.

1342
01:33:30,545 --> 01:33:33,579
I'm gonna be in my own custody from now on.

1343
01:33:34,549 --> 01:33:36,815
I won't go!

1344
01:33:36,951 --> 01:33:39,552
A nice-looking girl paid it.

1345
01:33:39,686 --> 01:33:40,720
I'll go.

1346
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:00,339
Hello, Bernard.

1347
01:34:00,975 --> 01:34:02,241
Hello.

1348
01:34:04,445 --> 01:34:07,628
Disappointed it's me
and not her, aren't you?

1349
01:34:07,648 --> 01:34:08,714
No.

1350
01:34:10,717 --> 01:34:12,084
If you say so.

1351
01:34:13,388 --> 01:34:15,302
Where'd you get the money?

1352
01:34:15,322 --> 01:34:16,589
She made a fool out of you

1353
01:34:16,723 --> 01:34:19,458
and you still wish
she was here instead of me?

1354
01:34:19,594 --> 01:34:22,395
I'm just surprised it was you.

1355
01:34:22,529 --> 01:34:24,645
I was sure she'd come back
to see what a mess I am.

1356
01:34:24,665 --> 01:34:27,800
Please don't call yourself a mess.

1357
01:34:27,935 --> 01:34:29,116
You don't know how much it hurts me

1358
01:34:29,136 --> 01:34:30,869
when you call yourself a mess.

1359
01:34:35,209 --> 01:34:37,542
I have something for you, Bernard.

1360
01:34:37,678 --> 01:34:38,477
What is it?

1361
01:34:38,613 --> 01:34:39,893
Found this place where they sell

1362
01:34:40,014 --> 01:34:41,580
fries and pretzels.

1363
01:34:57,031 --> 01:35:00,299
¶ Come on and take a bow ¶

1364
01:35:00,434 --> 01:35:03,669
¶ 'Cause you're a big boy now ¶

1365
01:35:05,973 --> 01:35:09,356
¶ And the great big world ¶

1366
01:35:09,376 --> 01:35:12,845
¶ Daddy threw before you ¶

1367
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:16,248
¶ With the pretty faces ¶

1368
01:35:16,383 --> 01:35:19,766
¶ And the claws that tore you ¶

1369
01:35:19,786 --> 01:35:26,591
¶ And it's all so different
when you get to sources ¶

1370
01:35:26,727 --> 01:35:29,394
¶ And love will make you strong ¶

1371
01:35:29,530 --> 01:35:34,066
¶ As a team of wild horses ¶

1372
01:35:55,356 --> 01:35:58,957
¶ I know there's things
you never thought before ¶

1373
01:35:59,093 --> 01:36:02,561
¶ That have to do
with walkin' out old doors ¶

1374
01:36:02,697 --> 01:36:06,965
¶ You've been prepared
as long as time allowed ¶

1375
01:36:07,101 --> 01:36:12,353
¶ Well I don't know how
but you're a big boy now ¶

1376
01:36:12,373 --> 01:36:14,155
¶ You're a big boy now ¶

1377
01:36:14,175 --> 01:36:17,242
¶ Come on and take a bow ¶

1378
01:36:17,378 --> 01:36:20,979
¶ 'Cause you're a big boy now ¶
¶ You're a big boy now ¶

1379
01:36:21,115 --> 01:36:24,049
¶ Come on and take a bow ¶

1380
01:36:47,474 --> 01:36:49,190
¶ You're a big boy now ¶

1381
01:36:49,210 --> 01:36:50,809
¶ Come on and take a bow ¶

1382
01:36:50,945 --> 01:36:54,395
¶ You're a big boy now ¶
¶ You're a big boy now ¶

1383
01:36:54,415 --> 01:36:56,014
¶ You're a big boy now ¶

1384
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:59,351
¶ Well I don't know how ¶
¶ You're a big boy now ¶

1385
01:36:59,486 --> 01:37:02,888
¶ But you're a big boy now ¶
¶ You're a big boy now ¶

1386
01:37:03,023 --> 01:37:06,491
¶ Come on and take a bow ¶
¶ You're a big boy now ¶

1387
01:37:06,627 --> 01:37:11,564
¶ You're a big boy now ¶
¶ You're a big boy now ¶

1388
01:37:11,698 --> 01:37:15,216
¶ You're a big boy now ¶

1389
01:37:15,236 --> 01:37:18,371
¶ You're a big boy now ¶

1390
01:37:18,505 --> 01:37:21,207
