1
00:01:01,901 --> 00:01:06,001
Axxon N., the longest running radio play in history

2
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,400
tonight, continuing in the Baltic region.

3
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,300
A gray winter day in an old hotel.

4
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:37,075
I am going to find out one day.

5
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,675
When will you tell him?

6
00:04:48,174 --> 00:04:51,674
Who could have known??

7
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:59,073
What time is it

8
00:05:13,371 --> 00:05:16,371
I have a secret.

9
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,469
There have been no calls today.

10
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:46,667
I hear someone.

11
00:05:56,066 --> 00:06:00,065
I do not think it will be much longer now.

12
00:09:28,241 --> 00:09:29,341
May l help you?

13
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:31,740
I am a new neighbor.

14
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,340
I live just down the street.

15
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,240
Ma'm?

16
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:45,239
Hello!

17
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,338
I don't mean to intrude

18
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:53,338
I am your new neighbor.

19
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:59,737
I hope that it is not being incovenient for you?

20
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:01,837
No, no.

21
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:04,536
Please, sit down.

22
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:11,336
Such a lovely home!

23
00:10:12,635 --> 00:10:13,735
Thank you.

24
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:15,535
We enjoy it very much

25
00:10:15,835 --> 00:10:16,935
Please

26
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:24,334
Uh, would you like uh, coffee?

27
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:27,834
That would be lovely.
Thank you.

28
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:29,333
And for you, ma'm?

29
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:32,333
the same, Henry,
thank you.

30
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:41,132
I've, l've been going around
meeting new neighbors.

31
00:10:41,332 --> 00:10:44,332
I think that it is important
know one's neighbors.

32
00:10:44,332 --> 00:10:48,231
To say "hello" to them.

33
00:10:52,331 --> 00:10:56,330
Yes, it's very rare these days
but that's very nice.

34
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,230
Which house are you living in?

35
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,329
Just down the way.

36
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,330
Tucked back in the
small woods.

37
00:11:08,729 --> 00:11:12,028
The brick house.

38
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:15,928
I think l know the one.

39
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:21,227
It is difficult to see it from the road.

40
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:39,225
Thank you.

41
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:02,722
Milk and sugar?

42
00:12:09,222 --> 00:12:11,321
OH, yes, very good.

43
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:13,321
Will that be all ma'm?

44
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:15,321
Yes. Yes, thank you.

45
00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:19,520
I'll be just close by
if you need me.

46
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,220
Thank you, Henry.

47
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:32,119
So...

48
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,518
You have a new role
to play, l hear.

49
00:12:38,518 --> 00:12:40,218
Up for a role

50
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:44,317
But, l'm afraid,
far from getting it.

51
00:12:44,317 --> 00:12:48,217
No, no, l definitively heard
that you have it.

52
00:12:51,317 --> 00:12:52,416
Oh?

53
00:12:53,716 --> 00:12:54,716
It is an...

54
00:12:57,316 --> 00:13:00,315
Is it an interesting role?

55
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:03,715
Oh yes, very

56
00:13:05,815 --> 00:13:09,414
Is it about marriage?

57
00:13:12,314 --> 00:13:15,314
Um... perhaps, in some ways...
but...um...

58
00:13:15,314 --> 00:13:19,213
Your husband, he's involved?

59
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:22,213
No.

60
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:42,310
A little boy
went out to play.

61
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,310
When he opened his door...

62
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:48,511
... he saw...
the world.

63
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,709
As he passed through the doorway...

64
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:57,609
... he caused, a reflection.

65
00:13:58,009 --> 00:14:01,208
Evil was born

66
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:08,307
Evil was born,
and followed the boy.

67
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:17,006
I'm sorry...
what is that?

68
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:22,906
An old tale.

69
00:14:23,306 --> 00:14:26,305
And a variation:

70
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:28,305
A little girl...

71
00:14:28,306 --> 00:14:31,706
... went out to play.

72
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:37,304
... Iost in the marketplace...

73
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:40,703
... as if half born.

74
00:14:46,103 --> 00:14:51,302
Then, not through the marketplace,
you see that, don't you?

75
00:14:51,402 --> 00:14:55,702
But through the alley
behind the marketplace.

76
00:14:55,802 --> 00:15:01,001
This is the way
to the Palace.

77
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:08,900
But it isn't something you remember.

78
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,299
Forgetfulness, it happens to us all.

79
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:20,699
And me?... why, l'm the worst one!

80
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,998
OH, where was l?

81
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:34,797
Yeah.. Is there is a murder
in your film?

82
00:15:38,797 --> 00:15:42,996
Ah, no, it's not part of the story...

83
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:45,196
No!

84
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:48,295
I think you are wrong about that!

85
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:50,895
No.

86
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,795
Brutal fuckin' murder!

87
00:15:55,395 --> 00:15:58,294
Ah... I don't like this kind of talk

88
00:15:58,794 --> 00:16:01,894
The things you've been saying,
l think should go now.

89
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:05,193
Yes...

90
00:16:05,793 --> 00:16:14,592
Me... I.. I can't seem to remember if it's
today, two days from now, or yesterday!

91
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:20,292
I suppose that if it was 9:45...

92
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:23,691
I'd think it was after midnight!

93
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:30,290
For instance...

94
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,190
If today...

95
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,290
... was tomorrow...

96
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:42,890
... you would'nt even remember 
that you owed on an unpaid bill.

97
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:47,288
Actions...

98
00:16:47,388 --> 00:16:50,988
... do have consequences.

99
00:16:54,987 --> 00:16:57,187
And yet

100
00:16:57,587 --> 00:17:00,287
... there is the magic.

101
00:17:03,287 --> 00:17:05,486
If it was tomorrow...

102
00:17:06,186 --> 00:17:12,185
... you would be sitting over there.

103
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:29,583
You see?

104
00:17:38,582 --> 00:17:40,682
Excuse me, ma'm?

105
00:17:42,182 --> 00:17:46,181
Excuse me, ma'm,
telephone.

106
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:49,381
It's for you.

107
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:53,281
It's your agent.

108
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,180
Greg!

109
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:03,279
Greg!

110
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:07,179
Oh my god! Oh my god!

111
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:21,577
My God

112
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:40,275
Nikki, it's we who are happy
and fortunate to have you on board

113
00:18:40,275 --> 00:18:43,275
... on this film,
in this role.

114
00:18:44,274 --> 00:18:47,174
I meant everything l said in
praising Devon.

115
00:18:48,174 --> 00:18:51,174
And forgive me, l do love
making speeches.

116
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:53,473
I mean this too...

117
00:18:53,573 --> 00:18:56,873
You have everything you need to soar
back to the top...

118
00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:59,273
... and to stay perched there.

119
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:04,172
This film, you and Devon,
a great director.

120
00:19:05,072 --> 00:19:07,972
Yes, do l hear?

121
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:11,171
The script is well, we're going to plunge into.

122
00:19:11,271 --> 00:19:14,971
If all play our role,
do our best...

123
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,271
... if we work hard together

124
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:20,070
...  well, this could be the one...

125
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,270
This is a starmaker, if ever l saw
one, you'll see

126
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,169
I think we have a chance
to pull it off...

127
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:30,369
what do you say?

128
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,369
Let's do it!

129
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:37,468
If you don't fuck it up Kingsley,
l'm sure we can!

130
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:41,668
I never felt better
in my life.

131
00:19:42,068 --> 00:19:44,167
Champaign and caviar
is on its way.

132
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:52,066
Tonight, Nikki Grace
and Devon Berk.

133
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:54,966
Marsha, honey l know where you live,
do not pull my hair.

134
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:56,266
We're back in:

135
00:19:56,266 --> 00:20:00,265
5,4,3,2,1.

136
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:04,165
Mamas, lock up you daughter's doors!

137
00:20:04,265 --> 00:20:10,264
Nikki, really, this news, this
shocking revelation by Devon...

138
00:20:10,364 --> 00:20:13,964
... must send a shiver down your spine!

139
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:15,664
Are you going to be able to be true
to hubby with a wolf in the den?

140
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:19,963
do with a bad wolf round you

141
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,263
Now, Marilyn...

142
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:27,062
I'm sure we'll get on famously,
in a professional way

143
00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:30,262
and that's how it will stay,
professional.

144
00:20:35,761 --> 00:20:40,461
And, Devon, your naughty boy,
are you hiding a smile?

145
00:20:41,361 --> 00:20:44,260
Is your devilish mind scheming?

146
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,459
If you're looking for shock value Marilyn, 
l suggest that you look in the mirror.

147
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,859
What a bitting wit!

148
00:20:57,259 --> 00:21:01,258
But l tell you this:
Marilyn Levins is going to be watching,

149
00:21:01,258 --> 00:21:05,458
and she will be reporting to you
everything she finds out!

150
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:12,657
There, and there, and there and beyond
around the world!

151
00:21:12,757 --> 00:21:16,656
The Marilyn Levins Starlight Celebrity
show will be back next week

152
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:18,256
... from Hollywood, California.

153
00:21:18,256 --> 00:21:20,756
Where stars make dreams...

154
00:21:20,856 --> 00:21:24,755
... and dreams make stars.

155
00:21:26,355 --> 00:21:29,555
How were you assholes thinking? That
was the biggest crock of shit l ever saw!

156
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,155
Show's popular!

157
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:32,254
Bullshit!

158
00:21:33,754 --> 00:21:36,254
OH, you guys, how did it go?
Honey, you were great!

159
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:39,255
-You were amazing, how do you feel?
You were incredible.  -Good...

160
00:21:39,255 --> 00:21:42,654
You absolutely nailed it.  Did you hear her?
Did you hear what Marilyn said?

161
00:21:42,753 --> 00:21:44,353
She said you blowed! You were perfect!

162
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,853
So Devon, this one's off limits, right?

163
00:21:48,353 --> 00:21:49,352
Don't even think about it...

164
00:21:49,652 --> 00:21:52,952
...If l don't kill you, her husband will,
and he is THE most powerful guy around.

165
00:21:53,052 --> 00:21:56,052
He knows everything. There is not a 
thing he does'nt know.

166
00:21:56,252 --> 00:21:58,551
I can tell you stories that
would color your hair.

167
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,151
So listen to me when l tell you.

168
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:04,751
Around Nikki, keep it in your pants.

169
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:07,750
What the fuck are you guys
talking about?

170
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:11,550
She's a nice girl, she's so far
from my style, it's not even funny.

171
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,649
Beautiful, Devon. Great.
We'll be able to sleep tonight

172
00:22:17,749 --> 00:22:21,349
You gotta admit though...
She's got a nice ass.

173
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:28,848
It's good.
-Goodnight guys!

174
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:30,947
- Goodnight, l'll talk to you tomorrow.
- OK.

175
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:34,247
-Bye!
-Let's go!

176
00:23:09,543 --> 00:23:11,243
Good morning
Mrs. Grace.

177
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:27,941
Fantastic.

178
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,140
It all in the beans!

179
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,640
And l 'm just full of beans!

180
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,239
Is that our set?

181
00:23:39,439 --> 00:23:42,039
Yeah
lt's not finished yet

182
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:45,439
There's Smithie's House.

183
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:47,438
Smithie's House.

184
00:24:03,336 --> 00:24:07,936
I should have guessed you two professionals
would be here early and beavering away...

185
00:24:08,036 --> 00:24:10,836
We're just laying about drinking capuccino.

186
00:24:11,136 --> 00:24:13,535
Devon makes a great capuccino.

187
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:14,835
Care for one?

188
00:24:14,935 --> 00:24:19,235
Thanks, but Prey and l just had a cup of tea.

189
00:24:19,236 --> 00:24:23,335
Actually, it was a terrible cup of tea
at the commissary.

190
00:24:25,434 --> 00:24:29,533
"Terrible" is an
adequate description of it.

191
00:24:47,331 --> 00:24:50,331
Well, l thought since we're here
and Smithie site's been started...

192
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:52,931
We might go over some of the scenes
that take place there.

193
00:24:53,131 --> 00:24:56,130
Not the love scene, of course, but some of 
the earlier scenes

194
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,030
that indicate so beautifully your character.

195
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:05,929
Lets take, for instance, 
scene 35...

196
00:25:06,329 --> 00:25:12,128
... the scene where Devon...
you arrive,

197
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:19,227
... Billy, at Smithie's house to find Sue,
--Nikki-- looking out the window.

198
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:21,127
I remember the scene

199
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:23,027
Well...

200
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:25,227
... we'll go through it....

201
00:25:26,227 --> 00:25:28,826
... and then we'll maybe take it on
the set and plug it out as possible

202
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:30,726
I guess we should just jump right in?

203
00:25:30,926 --> 00:25:32,026
-That would be jolly good.
-Ok

204
00:25:32,126 --> 00:25:33,126
And, l'll start it off...

205
00:25:33,926 --> 00:25:38,025
...on page 57.

206
00:25:38,325 --> 00:25:42,725
Nikki, this is just a rough run-through
So don't be hard on yourself...

207
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:45,924
-I am expecting from you, an Academy Award
performance, right out of the gate, so...

208
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:48,224
Thanks, Devon.
Get going, please

209
00:25:55,523 --> 00:25:57,623
I didn't think you'd be here...

210
00:26:00,523 --> 00:26:02,822
No, of course you wouldn't

211
00:26:03,422 --> 00:26:05,922
... that's because you...

212
00:26:06,922 --> 00:26:08,222
what

213
00:26:08,922 --> 00:26:11,121
what do you want?

214
00:26:12,721 --> 00:26:16,121
I said some things last night 
as you know.

215
00:26:16,221 --> 00:26:18,120
Yeah.

216
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,920
And l want to apologize

217
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,619
- Apologize?
- Yeah.

218
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,319
The things you said weren't the truth?

219
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:36,018
I didn't say that

220
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:40,018
Were they the truth?

221
00:26:49,617 --> 00:26:51,316
Are you crying?

222
00:26:53,016 --> 00:26:54,616
Uh huh...

223
00:26:55,716 --> 00:26:57,216
Yeah

224
00:27:00,915 --> 00:27:03,715
Are you sorry about last night?

225
00:27:04,715 --> 00:27:07,115
Are you?

226
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:11,714
Why are you crying?

227
00:27:13,514 --> 00:27:15,214
I'm sorry, Billy.

228
00:27:15,414 --> 00:27:17,813
I'm so sorry

229
00:27:18,913 --> 00:27:20,013
what?

230
00:27:24,213 --> 00:27:27,112
OH, shit.

231
00:27:30,512 --> 00:27:33,611
Look in the other room.

232
00:27:34,311 --> 00:27:36,111
What is that?

233
00:27:36,211 --> 00:27:37,911
Freddy!

234
00:27:37,911 --> 00:27:40,111
No, someone's there.

235
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,410
This stage is ours and ours alone.

236
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:54,609
Well, let's have a look.

237
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:04,201
Who was it?

238
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:08,500
Disappeared where it's
real hard to disappear.

239
00:29:15,699 --> 00:29:18,099
Maybe we should talk,
maybe this is the time.

240
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:21,199
Let's be serious for a moment
about something other than this scene.

241
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:23,198
why?
- what is it?

242
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:24,698
Sit down, l'll tell you.

243
00:29:28,698 --> 00:29:31,697
It was Freddy who
first heard about it

244
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:37,197
If you have an assistant who can hold his
liquor, then...

245
00:29:37,297 --> 00:29:39,096
... Freddy can do that with the best of them.

246
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:42,696
Somebody's got to do it,
Gable's dead.

247
00:29:44,396 --> 00:29:48,195
Now, Freddy is purposefully out and about
gathering what in this business...

248
00:29:48,295 --> 00:29:50,295
... is the most valuable commodity...

249
00:29:50,395 --> 00:29:52,195
... information.

250
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:57,194
Information is indispensable.
You probably know this from your own lives..

251
00:29:57,194 --> 00:30:01,094
... we all have people who gather...
agents, friends, producers...

252
00:30:01,694 --> 00:30:04,194
And sometimes they share,

253
00:30:05,693 --> 00:30:08,193
... sometimes not.

254
00:30:08,593 --> 00:30:12,393
Politics, ego,

255
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:14,592
... fear...

256
00:30:15,192 --> 00:30:16,292
Kingsley?

257
00:30:16,592 --> 00:30:19,592
sometimes l just isn't told the whole story.

258
00:30:21,691 --> 00:30:24,391
Kingsley,get to the point.

259
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,990
"On High ln Blue Tomorrows"
it is, in fact, a remake.

260
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,289
It's a remake?

261
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:41,689
I wouldn't do a remake.

262
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:44,489
No, no no, l know, of course,
But you didn't know

263
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:49,088
The original was a differrent name.
Started, but never finished.

264
00:30:50,688 --> 00:30:53,488
Now, Freddy has found out 
that our producers...

265
00:30:53,588 --> 00:30:58,287
... Know the history of this film and have takenit upon
themselves not to pass on that information to us.

266
00:30:59,487 --> 00:31:01,087
Purposefully

267
00:31:01,187 --> 00:31:03,186
Not on me, and l assume not the two of you...

268
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,486
True?

269
00:31:04,886 --> 00:31:07,186
No, absolutely

270
00:31:07,286 --> 00:31:09,186
Nobody told me anything.

271
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:11,685
No. Me neither.

272
00:31:12,085 --> 00:31:14,985
I thought this was
an original script.

273
00:31:15,785 --> 00:31:17,285
Yeah, well...

274
00:31:20,784 --> 00:31:23,184
Anyway, the film
it was never finished...

275
00:31:23,284 --> 00:31:26,684
Something happened before
the film was finished.

276
00:31:27,484 --> 00:31:30,983
I don'tot understand.
why wasn't it finished?

277
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:37,282
Well, after the characters
had been filming for some time,

278
00:31:37,382 --> 00:31:45,581
... they discovered something... something...
inside the history.

279
00:31:46,181 --> 00:31:48,781
Please, Kingsley.

280
00:31:49,181 --> 00:31:53,081
The two leads,
were murdered.

281
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:06,079
It was based on a Polish-gypsy folk tale.

282
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:09,179
The title in German was
"Fier Sieben".

283
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,378
"Four Seven".

284
00:32:11,878 --> 00:32:14,078
And it was said to be cursed.

285
00:32:20,277 --> 00:32:22,877
...so it turned out to be.

286
00:32:29,976 --> 00:32:30,776
What?

287
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:38,375
I don't understand.

288
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:40,375
Hmm, you don't speak Polish.

289
00:32:40,675 --> 00:32:42,175
No.

290
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:49,974
I think she understands more
than she lets on...

291
00:32:50,774 --> 00:32:52,373
But l don't speak it.

292
00:33:02,972 --> 00:33:04,972
Take a seat.

293
00:33:13,571 --> 00:33:15,771
What's this all about?

294
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,369
I've been hypnotized,
or something

295
00:33:27,169 --> 00:33:28,969
Hypnotized?

296
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:34,368
And l'm...

297
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:39,968
I'm ...

298
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:44,967
I'm going to kill someone.

299
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:49,167
Oh, yeah?
Who you going to kill?

300
00:33:51,766 --> 00:33:53,866
I don't know.

301
00:33:58,666 --> 00:34:01,465
Who hypnotized you?

302
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:08,264
The saw him looking at me once when l...

303
00:34:08,364 --> 00:34:12,664
... when l looked
around the bar, and...

304
00:34:13,364 --> 00:34:16,663
He done moved his hands...

305
00:34:18,663 --> 00:34:21,063
... and he said that l...

306
00:34:21,463 --> 00:34:24,163
... which l would'nt know who l was.

307
00:34:25,562 --> 00:34:27,762
How are you going to kill
this person?

308
00:34:28,962 --> 00:34:31,762
With a screwdriver

309
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:04,558
Your wife...

310
00:35:08,557 --> 00:35:11,357
I've been with her since
l was a little boy.

311
00:35:12,157 --> 00:35:14,057
A little boy?

312
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:19,856
Nothin' little about you now...

313
00:35:20,856 --> 00:35:24,555
As far as l heard, that is.

314
00:35:29,455 --> 00:35:31,055
why are you doin this?

315
00:35:31,655 --> 00:35:33,954
Doin what?

316
00:35:36,954 --> 00:35:39,154
Don't play dumb with me, Billy.

317
00:35:40,153 --> 00:35:41,753
I got husband.

318
00:35:42,253 --> 00:35:44,753
You got a wife
and two kids.

319
00:35:47,653 --> 00:35:50,552
why are you doin this?

320
00:35:51,452 --> 00:35:54,052
'cause l never met you before.

321
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,352
what?

322
00:35:57,351 --> 00:36:00,351
I didn't know you before

323
00:36:02,751 --> 00:36:06,150
I never had this feeling.

324
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,350
You have it too...

325
00:36:14,049 --> 00:36:15,349
Don't you?

326
00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:22,848
I can't afford to, Billy.

327
00:36:25,548 --> 00:36:29,448
All l see from this is blue tomorrows

328
00:36:34,947 --> 00:36:36,447
OK, cuts.

329
00:36:40,646 --> 00:36:42,646
That was brilliant
We're moving on...

330
00:36:42,746 --> 00:36:45,046
Check the gate please.
Camera reload.

331
00:36:45,546 --> 00:36:48,045
- Good, good.
- 27 for lunch.

332
00:36:49,445 --> 00:36:51,445
- Did you feel good about it?
-Yeah, l felt great.
-Ok

333
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:55,345
So we're going to leave this lovely weather?

334
00:36:56,844 --> 00:37:00,344
- Freddy, did you have an ashtray..
- I had one...

335
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:17,742
Going well?

336
00:37:17,842 --> 00:37:20,142
Very well, thank you, Freddy.

337
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:22,641
Very enjoyable

338
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:26,941
Enjoyable, yes,
thats is the word.

339
00:37:28,041 --> 00:37:32,540
Are you enjoying yourself Freddy?

340
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,339
Well, there is a vast
network, right?

341
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:41,839
An ocean of possibilities

342
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:45,839
I like dogs.

343
00:37:45,939 --> 00:37:49,538
It used to raise rabbits
l've always loved animals.

344
00:37:50,338 --> 00:37:52,138
Their nature...

345
00:37:52,338 --> 00:37:54,138
... how they think...

346
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:58,437
I saw dogs reason their way
out of problems.

347
00:37:58,537 --> 00:38:03,336
watched them think through the
trickiest situation.

348
00:38:04,336 --> 00:38:06,836
Do you have a couple of bucks l can borrow?

349
00:38:07,236 --> 00:38:10,836
I've got this terrible landlord.

350
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:25,034
Thanks.

351
00:38:26,934 --> 00:38:28,933
I got a lot of nerve, l know.

352
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:34,833
It seems like only yesterday
l was carrying my own weight.

353
00:39:13,528 --> 00:39:16,228
is the 19 year old neice...

354
00:39:16,428 --> 00:39:19,727
Ever since we went into pre-production,
she's been

355
00:39:19,727 --> 00:39:21,127
... fascinated by Smithie.

356
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:23,227
Keeps going on and on about Smithie...

357
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:28,726
... asking in that ancient
foreign voice of hers

358
00:39:30,026 --> 00:39:32,626
Who is playing Smithie?

359
00:39:57,023 --> 00:39:58,123
Where did everyone go?

360
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:04,422
Sorry she taken
Mr. Berg upstairs

361
00:40:11,421 --> 00:40:12,421
Alright.

362
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:36,418
I listen to you, but...

363
00:40:36,818 --> 00:40:39,718
... I don't hear him.

364
00:40:40,818 --> 00:40:42,517
Excatly sure what your getting in?

365
00:40:43,917 --> 00:40:46,117
I am going to put my arm around you

366
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:51,116
I want to hold you close.  You don't mind that, do you?

367
00:40:54,216 --> 00:40:55,816
What do you mean?

368
00:40:56,416 --> 00:40:59,415
Sometimes people don't say exactly
what they mean

369
00:40:59,615 --> 00:41:02,415
And you have been guilty of
this all evening.

370
00:41:07,415 --> 00:41:09,914
Now, l'll tell you something.

371
00:41:10,214 --> 00:41:11,614
And l will mean,

372
00:41:11,714 --> 00:41:15,014
... everything l say.

373
00:41:16,613 --> 00:41:19,413
My wife is not a free agent.

374
00:41:19,613 --> 00:41:21,813
I don't allow her that.

375
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,812
The bonds of marriage
are real bonds.

376
00:41:25,112 --> 00:41:27,112
The vows we take,

377
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:30,412
... we honor and enforce them.

378
00:41:30,413 --> 00:41:34,812
For our selves, by ourselves, or, 

379
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:39,411
if necessary,
they are enforced for us.

380
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:42,110
Either way, she is...

381
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,810
... bound.

382
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:47,010
Do you understand this?

383
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:55,409
There are consequences to one's actions.

384
00:41:55,509 --> 00:41:59,908
And there would, for certain, be consequences to...

385
00:42:00,108 --> 00:42:02,108
... wrong actions.

386
00:42:03,508 --> 00:42:05,508
Dark, they would be, and...

387
00:42:05,908 --> 00:42:08,507
... inescapable.

388
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:15,006
why instigate a need to suffer?

389
00:42:42,003 --> 00:42:44,203
Bucky J, are you there?

390
00:42:44,303 --> 00:42:46,803
- Is he there?
- Yes, he is there.

391
00:42:46,903 --> 00:42:50,002
I'd say we haven't still got the 2K quite in the right place

392
00:42:50,102 --> 00:42:53,202
I think l'd say up about 2 feet, you'd know better than me.

393
00:42:53,802 --> 00:42:55,102
But it's still...

394
00:42:55,302 --> 00:42:58,301
Boss, you want the 2K down?

395
00:42:59,501 --> 00:43:00,101
Want it down?

396
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:04,901
Yeah, l'd say about 2 foot down Bucky.

397
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,600
How much you want it to do down?

398
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah, a bit more...

399
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,700
- Keep...
- How far?

400
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,599
Another foot Bucky.

401
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:17,099
I haven't even touched it yet.

402
00:43:17,299 --> 00:43:21,998
Well then put it 2 foot from where it is...
no, a foot down from where it is Bucky.

403
00:43:22,798 --> 00:43:24,198
"...oss".

404
00:43:24,498 --> 00:43:25,498
What?

405
00:43:26,098 --> 00:43:28,198
Got it, boss.

406
00:43:30,298 --> 00:43:33,997
Bucky, l... Bucky just lower it 2 foot, would you?

407
00:43:34,097 --> 00:43:35,097
From there.

408
00:43:35,097 --> 00:43:37,097
No, Bucky.
It's going up.

409
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:40,096
I want it down, Bucky,
Two foot lower.

410
00:43:40,196 --> 00:43:42,496
This goddamn time l had a cramp

411
00:43:42,596 --> 00:43:44,096
Just a minute, l'm getting on it...

412
00:43:49,695 --> 00:43:50,895
Thank you Bucky.

413
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:53,095
Does we it in something else...
-go talk to him...

414
00:43:55,195 --> 00:43:58,594
Just uh... relax for a minute.

415
00:44:05,093 --> 00:44:08,993
Listen, get medics on the scene, and see what's behind this.

416
00:44:09,093 --> 00:44:11,793
- Yes, but. who..

417
00:44:11,893 --> 00:44:13,292
...Phil's on it.

418
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:16,392
- Phil's in.... We got Phil up there now, Bucky J doin a deal.
-Ok

419
00:44:16,592 --> 00:44:18,692
-  Please guys, lets work on these lighting cues,
alright, we need to work together...

420
00:44:23,191 --> 00:44:26,591
We're almost lit, 
couple of minutets

421
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:28,891
Alright, Tim and Sally, five minute warning,
five minute warning.

422
00:44:28,991 --> 00:44:34,090
Last looks on first team please,

423
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:37,589
Lockups go to place please,

424
00:44:41,889 --> 00:44:45,789
I'm heading out, you need anything?

425
00:44:46,588 --> 00:44:48,388
Quittin time already?

426
00:44:49,188 --> 00:44:50,488
Passed.

427
00:44:56,787 --> 00:44:58,287
Wanna stay for a drink?

428
00:44:58,587 --> 00:45:02,087
Naw, l'm late for gym.
- Gym?

429
00:45:03,286 --> 00:45:06,886
Is that with a 'g' or a 'j'?

430
00:45:07,086 --> 00:45:08,586
Oh, that's original.

431
00:45:09,086 --> 00:45:11,885
'G'

432
00:45:13,485 --> 00:45:15,085
what do you do...

433
00:45:15,685 --> 00:45:17,485
... at the gym?

434
00:45:17,985 --> 00:45:19,784
I exercise!

435
00:45:20,684 --> 00:45:22,884
why would you do that?

436
00:45:23,484 --> 00:45:24,984
See ya

437
00:45:26,884 --> 00:45:29,583
Stay for one little drink?

438
00:45:30,683 --> 00:45:33,083
I'm so lonely...

439
00:45:33,783 --> 00:45:36,982
Oh, poor small infant child...

440
00:45:39,882 --> 00:45:41,782
One?

441
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:48,781
Damn

442
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:01,380
Will there be anything else?

443
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:07,079
- No, thank you, Jim.
- My pleasure.

444
00:46:24,277 --> 00:46:26,677
You want to stay for dinner?

445
00:46:28,476 --> 00:46:29,776
Maybe

446
00:46:30,576 --> 00:46:32,076
I think you should.

447
00:46:33,076 --> 00:46:34,476
You do?

448
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:37,275
I really do.

449
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,474
This is a nice drink.

450
00:46:47,974 --> 00:46:49,374
Nice fire.

451
00:46:51,474 --> 00:46:53,973
wife and children gone..

452
00:46:59,273 --> 00:47:01,772
You talk too much.

453
00:47:04,472 --> 00:47:07,672
So sorry, baby.

454
00:47:10,571 --> 00:47:13,671
Don't ruin this...

455
00:47:16,971 --> 00:47:20,670
There's nothing to ruin Billy.

456
00:47:33,469 --> 00:47:34,868
Done cut.

457
00:47:34,968 --> 00:47:37,968
We copy cut.
Check gate.

458
00:47:46,267 --> 00:47:48,767
Yeah, l was right. Did anyone else read
the script?

459
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:53,066
The light should fade after Billy's line, do you see?

460
00:47:54,466 --> 00:47:55,366
Look.

461
00:47:55,466 --> 00:47:58,966
Alright alright, we go again please!
Back to 1 everybody!

462
00:48:07,564 --> 00:48:08,864
A car...

463
00:48:09,064 --> 00:48:12,064
A click Al, it wasn't a car, it was a  'click'.

464
00:48:12,164 --> 00:48:14,064
Guys on lockup outside, can we work on that please?

465
00:48:14,164 --> 00:48:18,963
Really, l can't have cars going by without...
No, we had lTC...

466
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:22,263
I don't think it was... It's something in the wire...
Will you pick that up?

467
00:48:28,262 --> 00:48:31,662
Thanks. I've got a lot of nerve, l know...

468
00:48:31,862 --> 00:48:35,961
... it seems that only yesterday lwas carrying my own weight.

469
00:48:37,561 --> 00:48:38,961
Thanks, Devon.

470
00:48:39,061 --> 00:48:40,961
My pleasure...

471
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,860
That is exactly what we need.

472
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:55,059
- Camera department, you guys ready?
- Yeah

473
00:48:55,159 --> 00:48:57,259
- OK.
- Where you gonna go sir?

474
00:48:57,259 --> 00:48:58,158
Can l have some coffee?

475
00:48:58,158 --> 00:49:00,758
Yeah, coffee comming in..

476
00:49:03,558 --> 00:49:07,557
After shooting, do you want to go get
something to eat with me?

477
00:49:14,357 --> 00:49:18,156
I bet you know a cute little ltalian resaurant.

478
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,156
Tucked away

479
00:49:21,356 --> 00:49:24,855
Private,
Great food.

480
00:49:26,455 --> 00:49:29,655
I do!

481
00:49:30,655 --> 00:49:33,054
How did you know that??

482
00:49:34,854 --> 00:49:36,954
Did l say a night?

483
00:49:46,553 --> 00:49:47,653
They're ready for you.

484
00:49:47,753 --> 00:49:50,552
Wait just a minute.

485
00:50:02,851 --> 00:50:06,150
I'll see you after the shoot.

486
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:14,249
Good luck
and run...

487
00:50:15,049 --> 00:50:16,949
And action!

488
00:50:58,644 --> 00:50:59,944
Billy.

489
00:51:12,242 --> 00:51:14,742
Is it this what you want?

490
00:51:21,841 --> 00:51:24,941
I won't fall in love with you.

491
00:51:48,938 --> 00:51:49,938
And cut!

492
00:51:52,138 --> 00:51:54,138
Are you two happy?

493
00:52:11,035 --> 00:52:12,135
What?

494
00:52:14,135 --> 00:52:15,235
I don't know.

495
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:19,934
Tell me.

496
00:52:22,134 --> 00:52:23,334
What?

497
00:52:25,734 --> 00:52:27,234
Something's happened.

498
00:52:28,033 --> 00:52:30,433
I think my husband
knows about you.

499
00:52:30,533 --> 00:52:32,733
About us

500
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:35,333
He'll kill you...
and me...

501
00:52:35,733 --> 00:52:37,132
He'll...

502
00:52:39,832 --> 00:52:41,132
Damn... it sounds like dialogue from our script!

503
00:52:44,232 --> 00:52:45,531
Cut. Cut it!

504
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:48,031
What's going on?

505
00:52:50,531 --> 00:52:51,231
What?

506
00:52:51,331 --> 00:52:55,930
What the bloody hell is going on?

507
00:53:09,928 --> 00:53:13,128
And we just don't know the actual, real reasons.

508
00:53:13,228 --> 00:53:15,428
... why this film wasn't finished.

509
00:53:16,028 --> 00:53:19,027
Now, you know some stories,

510
00:53:19,127 --> 00:53:22,227
But stories are stories.
Hollywood is full of them.

511
00:53:22,527 --> 00:53:23,427
Thank God.

512
00:53:23,427 --> 00:53:25,727
In this case, the same thing.

513
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,626
Stories which grew out of imagination.

514
00:53:29,226 --> 00:53:32,826
And we're surrounded by these
old stories every day

515
00:53:33,526 --> 00:53:37,425
And they shouldn't be taken as truth.
Or given creedence.

516
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:41,025
Or jeapordize Nikki's performance.

517
00:53:42,825 --> 00:53:44,624
Unless the stories are true.

518
00:53:44,724 --> 00:53:46,724
Devon...

519
00:53:51,224 --> 00:53:56,223
There is absolutely no proof that anyting
bad happened around this film.

520
00:54:27,019 --> 00:54:29,719
Tie me on and I'll come.

521
00:54:29,819 --> 00:54:32,019
Wait, stop, stop baby...

522
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,919
OH, God! Oh yeah. Oh God Damn.

523
00:54:42,517 --> 00:54:44,017
Ok, our first time...

524
00:54:44,017 --> 00:54:46,517
... fuck and it's good.
OH, please

525
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:48,217
Babe, you talk too fuckin' much.

526
00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:53,016
- Are you gonna talk through this whole thing?.
- Oh yeah.

527
00:54:59,015 --> 00:55:00,915
It's time.

528
00:55:20,013 --> 00:55:21,013
Remember...

529
00:55:21,613 --> 00:55:23,313
Rembember that thing

530
00:55:23,413 --> 00:55:27,912
When I said that thing
about me...

531
00:55:28,312 --> 00:55:29,912
Remember that?

532
00:55:30,012 --> 00:55:32,112
Yeah...

533
00:55:37,311 --> 00:55:40,111
Remember I told you, about this thing
this thing that happened.

534
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:47,010
It's a story that 
happened yesterday.

535
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,809
But l know that it's tomorrow.

536
00:55:50,409 --> 00:55:51,909
That doesn't make sense

537
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:53,009
It was that scene...

538
00:55:53,509 --> 00:55:55,009
... that we did yesterday.

539
00:55:55,209 --> 00:55:57,908
When I'm getting groceries for you
with your car

540
00:55:58,008 --> 00:56:01,308
And I was in that alley, and I parked the
car, there's always parking there.

541
00:56:01,408 --> 00:56:03,308
... So there I am...

542
00:56:03,308 --> 00:56:06,807
What?
Sue, damn!

543
00:56:10,107 --> 00:56:12,007
It's a scene we did yesterday.

544
00:56:12,207 --> 00:56:13,907
You weren't in it.

545
00:56:14,107 --> 00:56:19,206
That one where I'm in the alley, I'm going to get 
groceries for you with your car.

546
00:56:19,506 --> 00:56:21,806
And I parked there 'cause there's always
parking.

547
00:56:22,206 --> 00:56:23,905
You know the one?

548
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:26,805
I see this writing on metal.

549
00:56:26,806 --> 00:56:31,006
And l started remembering something...
I'm remembering...

550
00:56:31,104 --> 00:56:35,104
This whole thing starts floodin' in...
this whole memory.

551
00:56:37,004 --> 00:56:41,003
I start to remember...
And I... I don't know...

552
00:56:41,203 --> 00:56:44,703
I do not know what it is...

553
00:56:44,803 --> 00:56:49,802
It's me, Devon, it's me...
Nikki...

554
00:56:50,702 --> 00:56:52,002
That doesn't make any sense

555
00:56:53,802 --> 00:56:55,002
What is this?

556
00:56:57,001 --> 00:57:00,901
It's me, Devon, it's me...
Nikki...

557
00:57:01,401 --> 00:57:04,401
Look at me, you fucker!

558
00:57:13,999 --> 00:57:17,099
Please, please

559
00:57:17,399 --> 00:57:18,999
Please

560
00:57:19,499 --> 00:57:21,099
Forgive me.

561
00:57:23,998 --> 00:57:25,398
Please

562
00:59:23,884 --> 00:59:25,884
Look in the other room...

563
00:59:27,184 --> 00:59:28,483
What the hell is that?

564
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:28,983
Freddy!

565
00:59:29,483 --> 00:59:31,383
No, somebody's over there.

566
00:59:36,282 --> 00:59:39,282
The stage is supposed to be ours and ours alone.

567
00:59:43,982 --> 00:59:45,381
I'll go look

568
00:59:48,481 --> 00:59:50,481
- I'm sorry
- lt's ok..

569
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:50,874
Billy!

570
01:00:54,973 --> 01:00:55,773
Billy!

571
01:00:56,973 --> 01:00:58,173
Billy!

572
01:01:31,469 --> 01:01:32,769
Billy!

573
01:01:37,168 --> 01:01:38,968
Billy!

574
01:01:42,467 --> 01:01:43,967
Billy!

575
01:01:48,467 --> 01:01:49,867
Billy!

576
01:06:28,633 --> 01:06:30,333
Who the hell are you?

577
01:06:34,333 --> 01:06:35,833
Hey!

578
01:06:36,232 --> 01:06:39,632
Look at us and tell us
if you've known us before.

579
01:06:41,932 --> 01:06:43,232
There was a man...

580
01:06:44,032 --> 01:06:45,231
... I once knew

581
01:06:50,031 --> 01:06:53,830
Was it like this.. look around.

582
01:06:56,130 --> 01:07:00,330
Did he do that thing... you know
that little shaking thing?

583
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:04,029
While he was...

584
01:07:02,629 --> 01:07:06,129
You know...

585
01:07:09,129 --> 01:07:11,028
Wasn't that great...

586
01:07:12,928 --> 01:07:14,328
Yeah

587
01:07:20,627 --> 01:07:22,027
I'd let him do....

588
01:07:22,127 --> 01:07:25,827
... anything

589
01:07:49,724 --> 01:07:51,424
Strange...

590
01:07:51,623 --> 01:07:52,923
...what love does.

591
01:07:58,823 --> 01:08:01,822
So strange.

592
01:08:07,922 --> 01:08:09,421
In the bedroom

593
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:16,820
- You'll be dreaming...
- The kind of sleep...

594
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:21,520
When you open the eyes...

595
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:25,819
someone familiar will be there.

596
01:09:09,714 --> 01:09:11,414
This is the street.

597
01:09:17,013 --> 01:09:19,613
Do you want to see?

598
01:09:30,412 --> 01:09:33,411
Just down the way.

599
01:10:04,908 --> 01:10:06,907
It was...

600
01:10:06,907 --> 01:10:08,807
... to see...

601
01:10:12,907 --> 01:10:14,906
Very pretty...

602
01:10:14,906 --> 01:10:16,806
I know...

603
01:10:18,906 --> 01:10:22,805
Pick a cigarette.

604
01:10:22,905 --> 01:10:26,405
Erase him in the white silk.

605
01:10:32,804 --> 01:10:34,804
Arrive closer

606
01:10:35,304 --> 01:10:37,304
It approximate

607
01:10:39,403 --> 01:10:42,903
And it look...

608
01:10:42,903 --> 01:10:46,003
... through
of the hole.

609
01:12:47,088 --> 01:12:48,888
Breakfast

610
01:18:43,446 --> 01:18:47,445
I don't really understand
what l'm doing here.

611
01:18:51,545 --> 01:18:55,444
That's one hell of a fuckin' climb getting up here.

612
01:18:57,944 --> 01:19:02,044
So I was told you could help me.

613
01:19:12,942 --> 01:19:15,742
I guess I'll just tell you the thing..

614
01:19:16,842 --> 01:19:20,241
I just know that am l.

615
01:19:38,339 --> 01:19:40,239
There was this man...

616
01:19:41,839 --> 01:19:45,638
... I once knew...

617
01:19:45,838 --> 01:19:47,938
His name was...

618
01:19:49,238 --> 01:19:52,438
It doesn't matter what his name was...

619
01:19:54,837 --> 01:19:58,137
A lot of guys change.

620
01:19:58,537 --> 01:20:00,737
They don't change, but they reveal

621
01:20:03,036 --> 01:20:05,736
In time they reveal
what they really are.

622
01:20:06,136 --> 01:20:09,236
You know what l mean?

623
01:20:11,035 --> 01:20:14,435
It is an old story.

624
01:20:16,335 --> 01:20:17,935
Well this guy...

625
01:20:18,834 --> 01:20:21,734
...he revealed something.

626
01:20:23,334 --> 01:20:25,234
Looking back on it...

627
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:31,333
All along it was being revealed.

628
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:37,432
He was planning something...

629
01:20:38,232 --> 01:20:41,732
... planning something with me
in mind.

630
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:57,230
When l get mad,
I really get mad

631
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:03,829
I gouged a man's eye out when I
was 15 once, he was trying to rape me...

632
01:21:03,929 --> 01:21:06,829
I mean, the fucker had it out
pushing my legs apart.

633
01:21:08,829 --> 01:21:10,928
I got a finger on his eyes socket, 

634
01:21:11,228 --> 01:21:14,828
pretty  quick, rape was quite a long
 way off his mind.

635
01:21:17,128 --> 01:21:19,827
He was crying and screaming like a baby.

636
01:21:20,627 --> 01:21:23,427
"What a fuckin man you are," I said.

637
01:21:27,326 --> 01:21:28,826
There was goo...

638
01:21:29,726 --> 01:21:32,726
He still could still see
me with the one eye.

639
01:21:32,926 --> 01:21:37,525
See me comin' at him, grabbin' his nuts 
and tearin' at 'em.

640
01:21:39,325 --> 01:21:41,825
He'd seen that alright, felt it too.

641
01:21:43,124 --> 01:21:46,224
He was screamin' and wailin' like a little baby.

642
01:21:48,424 --> 01:21:51,124
He sat in the corner cryin'

643
01:21:51,423 --> 01:21:55,123
Alone and huggin' his nuts 'till the ambulance come

644
01:21:56,423 --> 01:21:59,223
the ambulance guys, they say:

645
01:21:59,323 --> 01:22:02,322
"What the fuck happened here?"

646
01:22:04,322 --> 01:22:05,422
I say:

647
01:22:05,622 --> 01:22:09,321
... "He come to a reapin' what he had been sowin', that's what."

648
01:22:10,521 --> 01:22:11,821
They say:

649
01:22:12,821 --> 01:22:16,221
"Fucker been sowing some kind of heavy shit..."

650
01:22:57,716 --> 01:22:59,515
It's the shits...

651
01:23:03,315 --> 01:23:05,915

652
01:23:07,914 --> 01:23:10,514
I saw it coming...

653
01:23:12,614 --> 01:23:15,413

675
01:25:55,894 --> 01:25:58,294
What is the money for?

676
01:25:58,494 --> 01:26:02,394
If it won't bring something like hope?

677
01:26:19,492 --> 01:26:22,391
I'm pregnant.

678
01:26:27,091 --> 01:26:28,990
Oh... Funny one!

679
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:33,690
I am pregnant.

680
01:26:40,989 --> 01:26:42,989
What is this?

681
01:26:44,589 --> 01:26:46,888
You don't seem too happy about it!

682
01:26:54,987 --> 01:26:56,987
Your pregnant?

683
01:27:04,786 --> 01:27:07,586
What is it?

684
01:27:08,586 --> 01:27:10,785
What's wrong?

685
01:27:17,385 --> 01:27:19,684
It just that it come as a shock to me

686
01:28:40,775 --> 01:28:41,875
Hello?

687
01:28:44,374 --> 01:28:45,874
Hello?

688
01:29:15,471 --> 01:29:16,770
Billy?

689
01:29:41,467 --> 01:29:45,467
I seen a man come at me with
a crow bar once.

690
01:29:46,167 --> 01:29:50,166
Guess he figured I was two-timing him.

691
01:29:51,966 --> 01:29:53,666
I was coming home.

692
01:29:54,066 --> 01:29:57,266
We were shacked up at the time.

693
01:30:01,965 --> 01:30:05,365
He was waiting for me in the half-light.

694
01:30:08,964 --> 01:30:11,064
Waitin' for me to come home.

695
01:30:11,564 --> 01:30:14,964
I guess he worked himself 
into some kind of frenzy.

696
01:30:15,263 --> 01:30:18,463
I opened the fuckin' door.

697
01:30:19,263 --> 01:30:22,763
And l seen his fuckin' shape burst out
of the chair....

698
01:30:24,062 --> 01:30:25,562
and a crow-bar goin up

699
01:30:26,262 --> 01:30:29,862
I screamed and turned

700
01:30:31,861 --> 01:30:33,661
Fuckin' crow bar comes down....

701
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:37,761
... smashin' into that fuckin' door

702
01:30:37,861 --> 01:30:40,061
... cheap piece of shit...

703
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,060
... it just splinters into 1000 pieces

704
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:46,460
... like it was glass, shit flyin' everywhere

705
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:50,059
I don't take this kind
of behavior.

706
01:30:54,959 --> 01:30:57,158
I seen what this fucko is up to

707
01:30:58,058 --> 01:30:59,058
Bam!

708
01:31:00,958 --> 01:31:03,758
I kick him in the nuts so hard that
they go crawling into his brain

709
01:31:03,858 --> 01:31:05,457
... for refuge.

710
01:31:05,457 --> 01:31:08,557
He goes down like a $2 whore.

711
01:31:08,857 --> 01:31:13,357
... cryin' and shit and tell me that he's
never done nothing but love me bullshit...

712
01:31:16,956 --> 01:31:20,956
Were you in fact seeing another man?

713
01:31:23,555 --> 01:31:27,055
I was screwing a couple guys for drinks,
no big deal.

714
01:31:31,954 --> 01:31:34,654
This one guy, he was kinda cute

715
01:31:35,254 --> 01:31:40,354
Fucker had a dick like a rhinocerous.
He'd fuck the shit out of you, I'll tell you what...

716
01:31:46,453 --> 01:31:48,652
He'd buy me a couple of drinks after.

717
01:31:53,752 --> 01:31:55,252
We'd talk.

718
01:31:55,352 --> 01:31:58,551
He'd tell me about a town he grew up in.

719
01:31:58,851 --> 01:32:02,351
All the little girls he'd fuck

720
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:06,550
There was a chemical factory in this town
and, uh....

721
01:32:08,350 --> 01:32:12,150
Telling us it was putting so much shit
 in the air you couldn't think straight.

722
01:32:15,149 --> 01:32:17,449
I got to a lot of the people.

723
01:32:19,849 --> 01:32:23,148
there was a lot of crazy shit going on there.

724
01:32:24,748 --> 01:32:27,548
People having weird dreams, and...

725
01:32:29,847 --> 01:32:32,647
... seeing things that wasn't there.

726
01:32:35,247 --> 01:32:38,546
So one time, this one little girl...

727
01:32:41,046 --> 01:32:43,246
... she was starin' off at somethin' one time...

728
01:32:43,646 --> 01:32:45,646
... starts screaming

729
01:32:46,445 --> 01:32:50,445
They.. the... people hanging around,
they come to her and

730
01:32:50,445 --> 01:32:54,245
... ask her what's wrong, and uh....

731
01:32:58,044 --> 01:33:00,644
She says she sees the end of the world.

732
01:33:03,243 --> 01:33:06,243
... on fire, and smoke
and blood rain".

733
01:33:06,743 --> 01:33:09,643
You know, like they say...

734
01:33:11,542 --> 01:33:15,142
The wailing and the gnashing of teeth.

735
01:33:17,692 --> 01:33:19,692
Hey!

736
01:33:23,841 --> 01:33:25,241
Look at me!

737
01:33:26,141 --> 01:33:29,140
And l tell me if you've known me before.

738
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:36,639
Yes,
we will do that.

739
01:33:48,738 --> 01:33:50,438
Where is the paper towels?

740
01:34:10,835 --> 01:34:13,835
They're behind you, on the table.

741
01:34:26,634 --> 01:34:31,533
It removes myself...
from this sinful dream...

742
01:34:34,033 --> 01:34:37,432
... which invaded
my heart.

743
01:36:01,022 --> 01:36:01,622
Who is she?

744
01:36:09,121 --> 01:36:10,621
Who is she?

745
01:36:41,717 --> 01:36:44,017
I almost didn't recognize you

746
01:36:47,417 --> 01:36:49,217
You startled me

747
01:36:51,716 --> 01:36:55,016
Strange...to find you on the street

748
01:37:00,915 --> 01:37:02,715
You seem upset.

749
01:37:04,215 --> 01:37:05,915
Are you?

750
01:37:07,114 --> 01:37:08,814
Should l be?

751
01:37:11,414 --> 01:37:13,914
- No, but...
- So l shouldn't be?

752
01:37:16,913 --> 01:37:17,913
No

753
01:37:18,913 --> 01:37:20,813
But still, you seem so

754
01:37:23,412 --> 01:37:25,112
I think you don't recognize me

755
01:37:29,112 --> 01:37:31,212
I think you don't recognize my manners

756
01:37:34,411 --> 01:37:36,011
That's true

757
01:37:37,211 --> 01:37:40,310
- You seem different
- You too

758
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:50,109
I'm used to seeing you in our home,
not on the street,

759
01:37:52,359 --> 01:37:53,909
at night

760
01:37:55,909 --> 01:37:57,908
Me too

761
01:38:06,407 --> 01:38:07,907
There was a murder

762
01:38:12,407 --> 01:38:14,106
How awful!

763
01:38:15,606 --> 01:38:17,906
- Where?
- Just down the way

764
01:38:19,506 --> 01:38:20,906
I think...

765
01:38:21,906 --> 01:38:23,505
...you knew the victim

766
01:38:26,705 --> 01:38:29,305
- Who was it?
- Don't know the name

767
01:38:31,904 --> 01:38:34,204
But l have seen you with this person

768
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:40,403
- You have?
- Yes

769
01:38:43,003 --> 01:38:44,903
I think l've seen the two of you together

770
01:38:54,702 --> 01:38:55,901
That's awful

771
01:39:23,998 --> 01:39:25,998
Who are those people?

772
01:39:26,298 --> 01:39:28,289
Hey, hello!

773
01:39:29,497 --> 01:39:30,497
Good to see you.

774
01:39:31,497 --> 01:39:32,897
Come in, come in.

775
01:39:32,897 --> 01:39:35,690
Get some hot-dog.

776
01:39:38,696 --> 01:39:41,296
You said 3 o'clock.

777
01:39:42,096 --> 01:39:43,996
Yes, that's right.

778
01:39:44,896 --> 01:39:46,286
You're right on time.

779
01:39:48,895 --> 01:39:50,995
The situation is becoming serious

780
01:39:57,094 --> 01:39:57,894
Give me my hammer.

781
01:39:57,994 --> 01:39:59,494
Give me that!

782
01:40:00,194 --> 01:40:01,985
Gives me now.

783
01:40:07,693 --> 01:40:10,686
Did you see?

784
01:40:25,191 --> 01:40:27,591
There is no paper.
For the toilet.

785
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:29,490
There is no paper.

786
01:40:30,590 --> 01:40:34,683
It is under the sink,
in the cupboard.

787
01:40:47,088 --> 01:40:48,479
what?

788
01:40:52,888 --> 01:40:56,287
They are a group that performs in
travelling shows.

789
01:40:56,487 --> 01:40:59,180
In the Baltic region

790
01:41:01,786 --> 01:41:05,086
What's that got to do with you?

791
01:41:05,786 --> 01:41:08,879
I will care for the animals.

792
01:41:15,185 --> 01:41:18,877
It was said that I have a way with animals.

793
01:41:28,183 --> 01:41:31,483
Fucker went to some eastern
europe shithole 

794
01:41:31,983 --> 01:41:34,976
... with the fuckin' circus.

795
01:41:37,782 --> 01:41:40,573
Can you fuckin believe that?

796
01:41:43,781 --> 01:41:45,481
That circus...

797
01:41:45,781 --> 01:41:50,674
... talk about carnies... Carnies, gypsies,
conmen, you name it.

798
01:41:51,980 --> 01:41:54,473
A real fuckin' ball of shit.

799
01:42:01,479 --> 01:42:04,072
There was this guy they had working there.

800
01:42:07,379 --> 01:42:08,479
He'd start talkin'.

801
01:42:09,478 --> 01:42:11,871
... you know, real regular.

802
01:42:13,072 --> 01:42:14,572
Talkin' up the crowd.

803
01:42:15,078 --> 01:42:16,978
They'd start listening...

804
01:42:17,277 --> 01:42:20,177
...   Pushin' in closer.

805
01:42:21,277 --> 01:42:24,370
 He did some sort of thing on people.

806
01:42:27,876 --> 01:42:30,769
They all called him the phantom.

807
01:42:34,975 --> 01:42:38,375
He got in a bar room fight one night...

808
01:42:38,975 --> 01:42:40,775
All the bar was arrested.  

809
01:42:40,875 --> 01:42:44,167
A lot of them fuckin' circus clowns.

810
01:42:47,474 --> 01:42:50,374
So when they take 'em all down to the station,

811
01:42:50,973 --> 01:42:52,664
Guess what?  ...

812
01:42:54,473 --> 01:42:56,573
... the Phantom's done gone and disappeared.

813
01:42:56,973 --> 01:42:59,965
This is the kind of
shit I'm talking about.

814
01:43:08,971 --> 01:43:11,662
He was a marine from North Carolina.

815
01:43:15,471 --> 01:43:17,970
I had a sister with one leg.

816
01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:22,363
... she had a sort of carved stick for the other one.

817
01:43:26,369 --> 01:43:30,469
She killed three kids in the first grade.

818
01:43:30,569 --> 01:43:33,961
This is the kind of shit.

819
01:43:44,467 --> 01:43:46,058
Fuckin' funny.

820
01:43:49,966 --> 01:43:51,457
People.

821
01:43:52,766 --> 01:43:55,266
All got their own peculiarities.

822
01:43:56,166 --> 01:43:58,858
Their own way of livin'

823
01:46:16,449 --> 01:46:17,449
What about school?

824
01:46:18,349 --> 01:46:19,449
One more day.

825
01:46:21,048 --> 01:46:21,948
One more day?

826
01:46:22,948 --> 01:46:24,239
Maybe two.

827
01:46:33,447 --> 01:46:35,138
Susan?

828
01:46:36,447 --> 01:46:38,739
What are you doing here?

829
01:46:43,346 --> 01:46:43,846
What?

830
01:46:44,746 --> 01:46:46,738
I thought you were gone.

831
01:46:57,844 --> 01:46:58,635
Billy.

832
01:47:01,944 --> 01:47:02,934
Billy.

833
01:47:05,443 --> 01:47:06,643
Something's wrong.

834
01:47:06,643 --> 01:47:08,834
Bad wrong.
Do you feel it?

835
01:47:15,442 --> 01:47:16,442
Sue?

836
01:47:17,742 --> 01:47:18,633
Billy.

837
01:47:19,741 --> 01:47:20,841
Do you love me?

838
01:47:22,241 --> 01:47:23,532
what?

839
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:28,940
Billy.

840
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:30,931
Sue.

841
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:36,732
Don't you remember anything?
How it was?

842
01:47:38,339 --> 01:47:41,232
I don't understand what you're talking about.

843
01:47:43,439 --> 01:47:44,738
Are you kidding?

844
01:47:45,638 --> 01:47:46,929
No.

845
01:47:49,638 --> 01:47:51,229
You go on, Sue.

846
01:47:51,738 --> 01:47:52,838
You go on now...

847
01:47:53,637 --> 01:47:55,437
Would you like me to call the police?

848
01:47:56,437 --> 01:47:58,228
No, we can handle this.

849
01:48:06,236 --> 01:48:07,027
Billy.

850
01:48:07,036 --> 01:48:08,336
Something is wrong

851
01:48:09,336 --> 01:48:11,235
I love you, Billy.

852
01:48:11,635 --> 01:48:15,128
I've had just enough.

853
01:48:17,335 --> 01:48:18,725
I love you

854
01:48:21,334 --> 01:48:23,125
Go away, Susan.

855
01:48:23,334 --> 01:48:24,825
I love you

856
01:48:26,733 --> 01:48:27,924
Sue!

857
01:48:30,133 --> 01:48:31,224
I don't care

858
01:48:32,233 --> 01:48:34,426
It's something more.

859
01:48:40,932 --> 01:48:44,424
I do not care
lt's something more.

860
01:50:40,018 --> 01:50:41,317
Gordy

861
01:50:46,417 --> 01:50:47,817
What do you want?

862
01:50:51,596 --> 01:50:53,016
Where is he?

863
01:50:54,016 --> 01:50:57,216
What's the point?
Are you blind? He's gone!

864
01:51:01,015 --> 01:51:02,415
Everybody?

865
01:51:05,315 --> 01:51:08,114
Why answer your stupid question?

866
01:51:08,614 --> 01:51:11,014
You're nothing! You've done nothing!

867
01:51:17,113 --> 01:51:19,113
Where did he go?

868
01:51:21,213 --> 01:51:25,362
No idea. He talked... mumbled
something about lnland Empire.

869
01:53:12,599 --> 01:53:16,392
I come about an unpaid bill that needs payin'

870
01:53:21,898 --> 01:53:23,689
All right

871
01:53:30,197 --> 01:53:35,190
Do you know a man who lives here?

872
01:53:53,795 --> 01:53:55,085
Do you know him?

873
01:53:56,194 --> 01:53:59,185
Yes. What is it?  What do you want?

874
01:53:59,894 --> 01:54:02,586
Which you want?

875
01:54:06,193 --> 01:54:10,586
He has an unpaid bill that needs payin'

876
01:54:11,392 --> 01:54:15,285
You already said that.

877
01:54:20,091 --> 01:54:21,991
Do you know a man who lives next door?

878
01:54:22,891 --> 01:54:25,682
Crimp is the name...

879
01:54:34,090 --> 01:54:36,582
It was a funny name.

880
01:54:37,489 --> 01:54:41,182
They was called Crimp.

881
01:55:09,586 --> 01:55:10,876
Hey?

882
01:56:43,974 --> 01:56:46,224
There's someone there

883
01:56:47,974 --> 01:56:49,674
I have to tell you

884
01:56:51,323 --> 01:56:52,973
There's someone

885
01:57:07,971 --> 01:57:09,371
Do you recognize her?

886
01:57:15,521 --> 01:57:17,070
I don't see her

887
01:57:19,970 --> 01:57:22,270
You understand she was sent for you?

888
01:57:23,570 --> 01:57:25,069
I don't know where l am

889
01:57:38,068 --> 01:57:40,668
- I hear her now
- Do you see her?

890
01:57:43,267 --> 01:57:44,367
No

891
01:57:46,567 --> 01:57:48,167
It was...

892
01:57:51,966 --> 01:57:53,166
...red

893
01:58:00,065 --> 01:58:01,765
You work for someone?

894
01:58:05,065 --> 01:58:06,464
Yes

895
01:58:08,764 --> 01:58:11,264
The one she spoke of

896
01:58:16,063 --> 01:58:18,063
Yes, l work for him

897
01:58:19,263 --> 01:58:21,163
So you understand

898
01:58:25,562 --> 01:58:27,462
The horse was taken...

899
01:58:29,062 --> 01:58:30,962
...to the well

900
01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:48,459
Take the pistol

901
01:58:51,759 --> 01:58:53,159
Let's go!

902
01:59:05,757 --> 01:59:08,157
Right away! It's past midnight!

903
02:00:18,649 --> 02:00:22,641
I am going to find out one day.

904
02:00:26,848 --> 02:00:28,639
It was red.

905
02:00:33,747 --> 02:00:35,238
Where was I?

906
02:00:41,246 --> 02:00:45,239
This isn't the way it was.

907
02:00:59,344 --> 02:01:02,836
It was the man in the green coat.

908
02:01:05,643 --> 02:01:10,336
It had something to do with
the telling of time.

909
02:02:21,634 --> 02:02:23,325
I am a whore.

910
02:02:28,633 --> 02:02:30,533
Where am I?

911
02:02:30,633 --> 02:02:32,924
I'm afraid

912
02:04:29,419 --> 02:04:33,311
Just a moment.

913
02:04:37,118 --> 02:04:40,011
I need to make a collect call.

914
02:05:59,608 --> 02:06:01,308
Look at me

915
02:06:02,908 --> 02:06:05,207
And tell me if you've known me before

916
02:06:46,303 --> 02:06:50,302
Someone is gonna fuckin' kill me...
Someone is gonna fuckin' kill me...

917
02:07:00,301 --> 02:07:02,201
Someone is gonna fuckin' kill me...

918
02:07:02,301 --> 02:07:04,291
You gotta let me in. I know
a girl.

919
02:07:04,392 --> 02:07:07,092
Carolina.
I know Carolina.

920
02:09:17,285 --> 02:09:22,277
-I don't really understand what I'm doing.
-It's one hell of a fuckin' climb getting up here.

921
02:09:25,084 --> 02:09:27,274
There was this man...

922
02:09:28,283 --> 02:09:31,976
... I once knew

923
02:09:35,282 --> 02:09:38,775
I'm trying to tell you so you understand
how it went.

924
02:09:42,682 --> 02:09:45,181
The thing is, I don't know....

925
02:09:45,281 --> 02:09:48,774
... what was before or after.

926
02:09:53,780 --> 02:09:56,280
I don't know what's happened first...

927
02:09:56,780 --> 02:10:00,272
...and it's kinda layin' a mindfuck on me.

928
02:10:10,578 --> 02:10:11,278
My husband...

929
02:10:11,278 --> 02:10:14,978
... he's fuckin' hidin' somethin'

930
02:10:15,978 --> 02:10:19,277
He was acting all fuckin' weird one
night before he left...

931
02:10:24,477 --> 02:10:28,067
He was talkin this foreign talk and...

932
02:10:29,576 --> 02:10:32,769
... tellin' loud fuckin' stories...

933
02:10:45,874 --> 02:10:48,267
I'm not who you think I am.

934
02:10:51,073 --> 02:10:52,364
Are you listening to me?

935
02:10:55,473 --> 02:10:57,564
I know it for a fact.

936
02:10:59,072 --> 02:11:02,965
I can't father children.

937
02:11:05,872 --> 02:11:11,464
Like this... his face all red...
his eyes buggin' out...

938
02:11:41,167 --> 02:11:43,667
I figured one day...

939
02:11:45,067 --> 02:11:47,067
... I'd just wake up and...

940
02:11:47,267 --> 02:11:51,259
... I find out what the hell yesterday
was all about.

941
02:11:55,466 --> 02:11:59,158
I'm not too keen on thinking about tomorrow.

942
02:12:01,465 --> 02:12:03,556
And today's slippin' by.

943
02:12:22,363 --> 02:12:24,655
I guess after my son died, 

944
02:12:26,161 --> 02:12:27,261
I went into a bad time.

945
02:12:30,261 --> 02:12:35,254
When I was watching everything go around me
while I was standing in the middle.

946
02:12:42,060 --> 02:12:46,253
Watchin it, like in a dark theater.

947
02:12:48,759 --> 02:12:51,050
before they bring lights up.

948
02:12:56,258 --> 02:12:57,949
... I'm sittin there,

949
02:12:59,658 --> 02:13:01,249
... wonderin...

950
02:13:03,658 --> 02:13:05,948
... "how can this be?"

951
02:13:47,552 --> 02:13:48,841
Hello?

952
02:13:49,252 --> 02:13:52,543
Yeah, she's still here.

953
02:13:55,551 --> 02:13:57,843
I don't think it will be too much longer now.

954
02:14:00,451 --> 02:14:02,042
Yeah, the horse to the well.

955
02:14:03,450 --> 02:14:05,450
Yeah.

956
02:14:08,450 --> 02:14:12,342
Yeah, he's around here someplace.

957
02:14:15,649 --> 02:14:19,242
Sure, I'm on it.

958
02:15:09,543 --> 02:15:11,342
What have you been up to?

959
02:15:11,742 --> 02:15:13,233
Where did you go?

960
02:15:16,442 --> 02:15:17,933
Where 'you been?

961
02:15:23,741 --> 02:15:25,432
Someone's there.

962
02:15:28,540 --> 02:15:29,831
Look.

963
02:15:53,237 --> 02:15:55,628
Hey, watch this move!

964
02:18:59,515 --> 02:19:02,108
You' dyin lady.

965
02:19:30,811 --> 02:19:33,911
what you say
about Pomona?

966
02:19:34,911 --> 02:19:38,004
what you say
about Pomona?

967
02:19:39,210 --> 02:19:42,910
You asked about the bus.

968
02:19:43,410 --> 02:19:46,903
Can't get no bus to Pamona.

969
02:19:48,609 --> 02:19:51,409
You can get the bus for Pamona here.

970
02:19:52,309 --> 02:19:55,502
If you get on the subway first.

971
02:19:57,808 --> 02:20:01,001
I never can get no bus.

972
02:20:05,007 --> 02:20:08,707
You can go all around Hollywood.

973
02:20:08,807 --> 02:20:13,299
I was in Hollywood Irvine,

974
02:20:13,506 --> 02:20:18,099
And you can get to Pomona
for 3,50.

975
02:20:18,100 --> 02:20:21,899
From Hollywood, Irvine to Pamona

976
02:20:23,805 --> 02:20:26,905
I never heard
of no bus there.

977
02:20:28,705 --> 02:20:31,797
I ride on the bus
to Pomona...

978
02:20:31,804 --> 02:20:35,195
.. Iast summer
to visit my friend...

979
02:20:35,204 --> 02:20:39,094
.. who lives there.
Her name is Nico.

980
02:20:39,003 --> 02:20:43,803
I stayed with her
two weeks.

981
02:20:45,603 --> 02:20:48,502
My cousin comes from Pomona.

982
02:20:50,202 --> 02:20:54,495
She has a place there, and said 
I can stay there.

983
02:20:57,201 --> 02:20:59,694
What time is it

984
02:21:01,701 --> 02:21:03,791
I don' know.

985
02:21:05,300 --> 02:21:07,500
It's after midnight.

986
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:10,000
After midnight?

987
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:15,593
My friend Nico, who lives
in Pomona...

988
02:21:15,599 --> 02:21:21,291
...has a blonde wig.
she wears it at Paris.

989
02:21:21,698 --> 02:21:27,298
but she's on hard drugs and turning tricks now.

990
02:21:29,397 --> 02:21:33,290
She looks very good
in her blonde wig...

991
02:21:34,297 --> 02:21:36,097
just like a movie star.

992
02:21:36,197 --> 02:21:39,296
Even girls fall in love with her.

993
02:21:39,496 --> 02:21:43,689
When she's looking so good...

994
02:21:44,496 --> 02:21:48,588
In her blonde star wig

995
02:21:48,895 --> 02:21:53,195
She blows kisses and loves

996
02:21:53,295 --> 02:21:59,387
But she has got a hole in her vagina wall

997
02:22:01,194 --> 02:22:06,086
She has torn a hole

998
02:22:06,993 --> 02:22:09,093
... into her intestine

999
02:22:09,193 --> 02:22:11,492
... from her vagina.

1000
02:22:11,592 --> 02:22:12,392
Shit baby...

1001
02:22:12,792 --> 02:22:16,185
you didn't tell us that shit...

1002
02:22:17,692 --> 02:22:20,091
She has a shitty doctor,

1003
02:22:20,191 --> 02:22:22,982
But it is too expensive.

1004
02:22:25,191 --> 02:22:29,983
And now she knows her time has
run out.

1005
02:22:32,390 --> 02:22:35,381
She scored a few more times,

1006
02:22:36,489 --> 02:22:40,182
And then, like that,

1007
02:22:40,189 --> 02:22:44,188
...she will stay at home, with her monkey.

1008
02:22:44,488 --> 02:22:47,188
It has a pet monkey.

1009
02:22:47,188 --> 02:22:52,287
This monkey shits everywhere,
But she doesn't care

1010
02:22:52,787 --> 02:22:54,687
This monkey can scream.

1011
02:22:54,787 --> 02:22:59,080
It screams like it in a horror movie.

1012
02:23:05,786 --> 02:23:10,278
But there are those who are
good with animals.

1013
02:23:11,885 --> 02:23:16,076
Who have a way with animals.

1014
02:24:15,778 --> 02:24:18,470
It's ok..
You dying is all

1015
02:24:49,074 --> 02:24:52,266
I'll show you the light now...

1016
02:24:56,473 --> 02:24:59,865
It burns bright, for heaven.

1017
02:25:04,472 --> 02:25:07,864
No more blue tomorrows.

1018
02:25:14,871 --> 02:25:17,963
You goin high now love.

1019
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:42,851
And...

1020
02:26:44,660 --> 02:26:46,451
And.. Print it!

1021
02:26:50,659 --> 02:26:52,159
It was fantastic.

1022
02:26:52,359 --> 02:26:56,751
Check the gate. 
check the gate please!

1023
02:27:15,656 --> 02:27:18,656
Lets go right now
for Nikki Grace.

1024
02:27:19,156 --> 02:27:20,656
Nikki Grace, everybody.

1025
02:27:20,756 --> 02:27:21,946
Bravo!

1026
02:28:11,649 --> 02:28:13,342
What's a matter with Nikki.

1027
02:28:39,746 --> 02:28:40,546
Nikki.

1028
02:28:41,746 --> 02:28:42,537
Nikki.

1029
02:28:50,845 --> 02:28:52,136
Nikki.

1030
02:28:52,545 --> 02:28:54,935
You were wonderful.

1031
02:30:43,631 --> 02:30:47,124
I guess after my son died,

1032
02:30:47,431 --> 02:30:51,623
, I went into a bad time.

1033
02:30:52,730 --> 02:30:58,030
When I was watching everything go around me 
while I was standing in the middle.

1034
02:30:58,130 --> 02:31:02,820
Watching it, like in a dark theater.

1035
02:31:04,429 --> 02:31:08,321
before they bring the lights up.

1036
02:31:18,827 --> 02:31:19,627
Hello?

1037
02:31:20,127 --> 02:31:21,018
Yeah

1038
02:31:22,127 --> 02:31:24,018
She's still here

1039
02:31:25,626 --> 02:31:26,715
Yeah...

1040
02:31:28,726 --> 02:31:30,326
He's around here someplace.

1041
02:31:30,426 --> 02:31:32,017
That is right.

1042
02:42:31,247 --> 02:42:33,538
Heather?

1043
02:42:36,446 --> 02:42:38,037
Paul?

1044
02:46:18,720 --> 02:46:21,411
Sweet...
