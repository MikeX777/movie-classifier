1
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,920
'Tales' could not have been made in 2012 if not
for the help and support of the Iranian cinema family
Shirin Dibaj

2
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,740
Tales

3
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,900
They were supposed to take us 
with visas and work permits

4
00:00:39,828 --> 00:00:42,700
Not just me, many others like me

5
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,560
I got the money for our house
from my mum...

6
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,160
I handed it over to him

7
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,140
-Want me to drive slower to get a good picture?
-No, it's fine

8
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,600
Do you have a lighter?

9
00:01:06,604 --> 00:01:08,860
-Here you go
-Thanks

10
00:01:09,012 --> 00:01:11,060
-Keep it
-I'll buy one

11
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:14,480
-Take it for now
-Thanks

12
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,660
Seems like it's not meant to be

13
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,240
Are you from overseas?

14
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,620
-Me?
-Yes

15
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:39,540
-No, why?
-You're filming the streets

16
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,860
That's how I observe

17
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,640
So...

18
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,320
-You paid them and they left
-I got into so much trouble

19
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,380
I lost everything

20
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,580
I thought, I did this and I'll fix it myself

21
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,260
I started a job, I messed up
at the first attempt

22
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,440
I lost all the drugs

23
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,160
I ran away from the dealers...

24
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,320
A few years

25
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,300
They'd chop me up if they found me

26
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,800
I'm still scared

27
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:29,120
-That's it
-This town is too crowded

28
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,340
On my way, yeah, I'm coming

29
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,520
Okay, I'll pick her up.
I said I would

30
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,200
Bye

31
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,360
She works three night shifts
for a tiny nursing wage

32
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,060
This poor thing is always
wandering around

33
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,000
My daughter, her name is Sarvenaz

34
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,320
God bless

35
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,940
Who takes care of her, then?

36
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,680
-My mother
-God bless her

37
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,740
You know what really upsets me?

38
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:22,680
The mother never complained once

39
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,580
I wish she'd slap me

40
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,460
I wish she'd do something
to hurt me back

41
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,900
When I got back I found out
she'd worked double shifts...

42
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,780
To pay for
my brother and sister's education

43
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,920
I have to get out here

44
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:50,800
-Sorry, I talked too much
-No, it was great

45
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,600
-I wish you'd filmed me too
-I would have if I'd known

46
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,100
-Here you go
-Be my guest

47
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,100
-Please
-Thanks

48
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,820
Bye

49
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:21,440
Hi Touba, how's my daughter?

50
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,880
Okay. Do you need anything?

51
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,820
Okay, bye

52
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,320
Where are you going?

53
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,300
-Where are you going?
-Wherever you decide

54
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,440
-What do you mean?
-You have your own place, right?

55
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:19,060
Get out

56
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:24,980
-Have some shame, get out
-He'll fall asleep

57
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,960
Get out 
before I kick you out myself

58
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,900
Fine, my baby has a fever,
drop me off at the junction

59
00:05:37,568 --> 00:05:39,400
Do you have any cigarettes?

60
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,040
-Where are you from?
-Why?

61
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,240
-Don't you have a brother to beat you?
-I've no brother, I'm not in the mood

62
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,020
-Pull over, I'll get out
-We had a girl in our neighbourhood

63
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,740
-Stop
-Since they moved to our area...

64
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,200
She got close to  my sister
Mahboubeh

65
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,600
My mother would braid their hair

66
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,660
Mahboubeh was jealous of Masoumeh
since she had thick hair

67
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,100
Her name was Masoumeh

68
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:57,680
-You didn't say where you're from?
-Pull over, I'll get out

69
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,640
Don't you need medicine for your son?

70
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,480
I was saying

71
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,660
They'd go to school together

72
00:07:10,548 --> 00:07:14,760
Either Masoumeh was at ours
or Mahboubeh was at theirs

73
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:21,580
Masoumeh was such a nice girl
like yourself...

74
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,620
Unlike her junkie brother

75
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,560
Stop, I'll get out

76
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:33,920
Here, I don't have a lighter

77
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,320
When Masoumeh left
Mahboubeh got sick

78
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,680
She looked everywhere for her

79
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,520
Once she found her
but she went missing again

80
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:51,280
She hid something
at the back of her closet...

81
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,120
A long braided lock of hair...

82
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,760
That belonged to the girl

83
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,620
One night her stupid brother
picked on her for nothing

84
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,820
He hit her and cut her hair

85
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,200
Masoumeh left for good the next day

86
00:08:15,644 --> 00:08:17,440
God!

87
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,100
Sit

88
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,660
-Hi
-Hi

89
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,340
-I got so worried, why are you so late?
-I had a customer

90
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:15,040
-Did you have an accident?
-No, Touba

91
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,040
Ask Sarvenaz to come.
I'm tired, I want to go

92
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,340
She's asleep with an empty stomach

93
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,560
Let me take her, then

94
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,920
-Where's Mahboubeh?
-She stayed with her sister

95
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,480
-Did Hamideh argue with her husband again?
-No

96
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,180
Is there something wrong with Ali
that you're not telling me?

97
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,600
Well?

98
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:50,860
I'd do something if there was

99
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,120
I beg you, don't hide anything from me

100
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,440
I saw Masoumeh

101
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,980
Our Masoumeh? Zahra's daughter?

102
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,860
Yes

103
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,720
Where was she?
What was she doing?

104
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,240
What can I say?

105
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:25,380
Didn't you ask why she did this
to her poor mother?

106
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,880
She pretended she wasn't Masoumeh

107
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,900
You should've asked her for an address
so her mother could see her

108
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,040
It's better if she doesn't

109
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:54,940
Mothers should look for their kids
on the streets

110
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,720
-Here
-Thank you

111
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,620
You gave me the form.
You could've written my request too

112
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,940
Ask someone over there to do it for you

113
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,360
Who?

114
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,540
<i>This is a staff announcement</i>

115
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:39,220
<i>Working hours are from 8:30 a.m.
till 15:30 </i>

116
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,280
<i>Thank you for your cooperation</i>

117
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,760
Hi

118
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:55,700
Could one of you please
write a letter for me?

119
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,500
Please, if you could

120
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,720
-What sort of letter?
-A request

121
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:07,220
I've written like ten now.
They say

122
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,280
you need to write one

123
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:16,360
to a circle, group,
an office or something

124
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,160
-Yes
-Sit down

125
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,040
What's your problem? Tell me
so I can tell you who to address

126
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,060
The company hasn't paid me
for nine months

127
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:35,560
I keep asking for help
but no one gets back to me

128
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,820
I got it

129
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:49,420
The Pensions' Support Allowance

130
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:56,620
To whom it may concern

131
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,240
Miss, your name is?

132
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,880
Were you official staff or a temp?

133
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:18,600
Can't we do an interview? I'm ready
and I'll get the license for it

134
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:23,900
I explained once, my documentary
is about problems regarding the clients

135
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,360
It has nothing to do with the staff

136
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,360
Turn on your camera, I'll connect it

137
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:33,660
-You know Mr Goudarzi
-Oh! I get it

138
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,620
Thanks for getting back to me so fast

139
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,440
I've been waiting for my turn all day

140
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,500
One moment, if you're not running late
we can have tea

141
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,140
No, I'm late, I was here to speak
to the clients, looks like I can't

142
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,520
Clients just moan and whinge

143
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:57,740
Everyone has problems
but the staff want to speak

144
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:05,520
People should find the solution
within themselves

145
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,180
Nice excuse, not my problem

146
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,180
Bye

147
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:24,460
Sir, will you please write
the rest of my letter, please?

148
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,700
I need something inside,
I'll be right back

149
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,160
Thanks

150
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,100
Okay

151
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,660
We'll get everything

152
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,560
Forget the watermelon,
I can't handle that

153
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:49,560
Why do I have two sons?
Send them

154
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,400
I've no car

155
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:59,040
It might be done by Saturday night,
I don't know

156
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,120
I don't know, bye

157
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:09,060
Look, sign these,
these have all been piled up

158
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,640
Who asked you to come in?

159
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,600
I was in the queue, I thought

160
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,540
It was my turn,
didn't you call my name?

161
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,480
What do you want?

162
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,940
This is the report
of what happened to me

163
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,760
I'm too busy to read all this.
You tell me

164
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:41,780
-Right, I'm Mohammad Javad Halimi
-Stand in your spot

165
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,080
-Is this good?
-Yes

166
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:55,640
Right, I'm Mohammad Javad Halimi

167
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:01,980
Retired office worker

168
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,420
How many hands do I have?

169
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,880
I worked for the government too

170
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,780
-I've been retired for 15 years now
-Sir

171
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,180
Yes

172
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,760
Is this the time for Bademjan?

173
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,420
No, how many hands do I have?

174
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,620
Fine, I'll be home for 4

175
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,940
Right, 3 months ago I faced a problem

176
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:40,340
I was sent to hospital
and had emergency surgery

177
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,160
Insurance covers my surgery

178
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,440
-I'll use a fingerprint
-Fine

179
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,660
But the problem is...

180
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:56,040
Because of the urgency, they sent me
to a hospital not covered by insurance

181
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:03,000
My surgery was performed
on a bank holiday

182
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,480
Therefore the case for insurance
was postponed to...

183
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,080
Hi, Jafar

184
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,140
What?

185
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:20,720
Jafar, I'm stuck Thursday, Friday

186
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,960
I'm busy

187
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,000
I need my car tomorrow,
thanks. Bye

188
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,280
-What do you need?
-I said

189
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:41,020
I'm covered by insurance,
I can't explain my problem

190
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:47,660
On the day of a holiday...
are you listening?

191
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,520
I got so sick

192
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:55,540
And the ambulance collected
my half dead body...

193
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:00,320
Went to a private hospital

194
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,380
I've had to pay from my own pocket
for the treatment

195
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,280
And I'm now in debt

196
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:18,520
When I applied for refunds, I was told
since I reported it a little late...

197
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:22,520
I was asked to go
for a second diagnosis

198
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:28,660
Sorry, but a check-up of
the same area...

199
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:35,820
-The private part I mentioned
-Speak clearly, sir

200
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,140
-Pick it up
-Just this one

201
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:43,860
I'll come to you, go

202
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,380
Go

203
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,940
Yes love, where were you
when I called?

204
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:58,980
The salon? Why there?

205
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,640
Blue black?

206
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,300
The type I liked?

207
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:10,700
I'll see you tomorrow

208
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,620
I love you

209
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,960
Okay

210
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,900
What a mess

211
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:32,240
-Are you leaving?
-Would you like to chat till the weekend?

212
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,960
Sir, I said what do you want?
Make it short

213
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,800
Sure, I'll put it in a telegram

214
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,680
I'm Halimi, retired,
three years and eight months experience

215
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:47,340
27 days ago, emergency surgery

216
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:50,720
Treatment payments, private debt

217
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,040
Loans from family and friends,
request for refund

218
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:01,280
Unethical request of organisation
for second diagnosis of special place

219
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,820
Oh, so it's the private area

220
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:10,120
-Get to the point, why take so long?
-What do you mean?

221
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,700
After 30 years of honest service,

222
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:20,500
do I have to pull my pants down
in front of strangers to prove my point?

223
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,180
Up to you, the laws are clear

224
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,640
-You should leave
-Where to?

225
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,700
I'm talking to you, sir

226
00:22:31,732 --> 00:22:35,020
Should I stand here listening to reports
of your private areas?

227
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,920
I've been sat waiting here
the whole day

228
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:43,940
Now that it's my turn
you're leaving during working hours

229
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,560
What a mess

230
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,140
Send Nemat up

231
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,060
Who's there?

232
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,660
He's small, you can handle him yourself,
he's a nuisance

233
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:08,060
-Go on
-Watch your language, sir

234
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:13,020
I've not touched a penny
all these 30 years

235
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:20,340
Now I have to pull my pants down
and prove my point to people like you?

236
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,680
Let go, stop him, not me

237
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:27,920
-I have to come to a conclusion
-You'll pass out and get me in trouble

238
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:31,440
-I'll report you
-Don't make a fuss, sir

239
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,360
You think I don't know 
what you're up to during work hours?

240
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,320
You're tending to your multiple wives
instead of doing your job

241
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:46,880
You're worried about blue black or chestnut hair?

242
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,400
How do you live with yourself?

243
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,020
I'll show you

244
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:57,520
-Stop it
-Where did they take him?

245
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,120
Stop the fuss

246
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:05,500
You have a camera

247
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:09,220
-Clear the tape
-We'll buy that

248
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,360
We're buying rope too

249
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:17,800
Just tie my hands tight 
so I can't undo it

250
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,060
-It won't
-Then...

251
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:26,720
We need to hold a knife

252
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:44,760
-What if your husband comes home?
-Say hi if you see him

253
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:49,200
-What if he does?
-I said he's not been home for 2 months

254
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:54,040
-What if he decides to come?
-So what

255
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,540
-It's not his problem
-Really?

256
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,220
Tell me what else we need

257
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:05,320
Stop! They've no shame

258
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,100
This is the end, stop!

259
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,480
Is it him again?

260
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,580
-Yeah
-So he believed us

261
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:28,200
This means we've done a good job so far

262
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,580
How did he not recognise your voice?

263
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:37,340
We have your daughter. 
You'll receive a video tonight

264
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:41,360
You'll send 30 million or you'll find 
your daughter's dead body

265
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,720
He won't care

266
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,120
I got worried, how would he not care?

267
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:56,740
I callled him and said I'm not well,
I'm annoyed

268
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,080
-I want to leave this hell hole
-So he said safe trip

269
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:06,080
He said you decided to get married,
it's your own problem now

270
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,380
I said fine, I did get married

271
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:14,080
-Am I your daughter or not?
-Didn't he say he's forgotten about us?

272
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,060
He says it all the time to me

273
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:24,140
He's just afraid of losing his reputation

274
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,820
Kidnapped his daughter. I'm used to this

275
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,780
You're ruining my reputation, you don't understand

276
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:38,220
He's willing to pay 200 for his reputation

277
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,320
You remember how he embarrassed us last time

278
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,920
I'll break your legs, get out of this house

279
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,760
This isn't a cabaret

280
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:54,280
He deserves some druggie kids

281
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,660
He'd learn his lesson then

282
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:01,020
His entire problem is what to do
with his girlfriends

283
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:04,520
Not to lose them

284
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:09,460
He drove Mum away, now it's our turn

285
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,760
Why don't you visit Mum?

286
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,420
I don't feel well there

287
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:23,440
-It makes me sick how she's a pushover
-He's nice

288
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:27,880
-I swear, he's better than Dad
-Yeah

289
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,920
Poor Mum

290
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,920
You didn't tell Mum about
the mess you got into

291
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,740
What would I say?

292
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:40,520
You're right, what would you say?

293
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:46,120
-You're out of your mind, how are you a businessman?
-Here we go again

294
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,380
Look at me, you can't get yourself together

295
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:55,500
You write cheques now?

296
00:27:56,430 --> 00:28:00,740
-"I've got to have money in two days"
-I was supposed to have it two months ago

297
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:03,780
Well done! Thanks

298
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,200
But if I could...

299
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,340
Bookselling, DVDs, music...

300
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,640
Cafe, Internet cafe...

301
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,200
Small movie screenings...

302
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:18,300
-Small bowls of soup
-You're mental

303
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,720
Get help from a doctor

304
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:27,100
People have no food on their table,
they're going bankrupt

305
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:31,740
Now you decide to start your own business

306
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,520
I was quite good though

307
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:40,420
We'l leave the video and tell you 
where you can collect it

308
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,760
I did a good job

309
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:15,500
Our role here to help girls and women 
who decide to quit

310
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,040
-Under the right circumstances
-Great

311
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,800
-Is it okay if I film it?
-If you've a license

312
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:26,240
-Hi
-Hi love, how are you, Kokab?

313
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:29,760
-If you've a license, sure
-Of course

314
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,640
Hi

315
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,680
You had a few phone calls 
from the Sarallah Hospital doctor

316
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,840
A woman named Gilaneh
left a message

317
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:43,560
-God help me
-Dr Gabiri helps us voluntarily here

318
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:46,220
-Nice to meet you
-Good day

319
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:52,440
In the circumstances these women are under, 
if their images are displayed

320
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,060
-They'll face problems
-Of course! I'm not here to make trouble

321
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:59,180
-I'm here to help
-Sorry

322
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,860
-Yes
-I'll call

323
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,980
Yes! I was waiting for your call

324
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:12,360
<i>Help me, Doctor</i>

325
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:17,780
<i>Esmail is dying, Doctor</i>

326
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,320
<i>He's been unconscious since yesterday</i>

327
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:27,320
<i>I beg you to come here </i>

328
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:31,360
<i>The doctors here don't know him</i>

329
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:34,840
<i>You went to war together</i>

330
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:41,560
<i>Are they right saying he'll die?</i>

331
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:50,980
<i>What did you to yourself, son?</i>

332
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,200
Are you okay, Doctor?

333
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,060
-Hi
-Come in

334
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:04,420
-Did I disturb you?
-No it's nothing

335
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:11,040
Sometimes I wish I'd lost my eyes
and ears instead of my arm

336
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,540
Why, Doctor?

337
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:16,240
-How are you?
-Good

338
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,260
-Are you on track?
-Yes

339
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,580
-Medication and tests
-Yeah

340
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,740
-Hi
-None for me, I'm leaving

341
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:27,160
-I'll send Samire in before you leave
-Okay

342
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:32,560
Don't forget to be at the hospital 
on Monday at 7 for Dr Hosseini to see you

343
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,900
-Sure, thanks
-No problem

344
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,320
-Will you come here, Narges?
-Sure, I'm coming

345
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:43,520
Put out your cigarette,
Samira has missed you

346
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,560
-I thought she should come see you
-Sit down

347
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:52,220
I'll take the girls to the hospital. Bye

348
00:31:52,730 --> 00:32:01,280
What's wrong?

349
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,940
-Pass it here
-Can you do it?

350
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:16,140
-Of course I can
-Kobra, you have a bad back

351
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:19,760
Move them into the storage

352
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,780
Why didn't you take the shopping down, Kobra?

353
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,820
Sara Hamed is waiting for you

354
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,300
Miss Monshi Zadeh,
I've got to go to Sarallah

355
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:01,020
I've written Samira's prescription,
she needs a painkiller

356
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,800
-She's not feeling well
-Thanks

357
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,300
-Hi
-I can give you a lift

358
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:09,480
-Thanks
-Your change

359
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,280
No we owe you money for some of the work

360
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,360
Keep the receipts, this is Kokab
and her daughter's results

361
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:22,300
-I almost die every time I open these
-I know

362
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:27,980
Take me outside Samira's dad's shop 
when you come back

363
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,720
I have a student at 6

364
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,260
Can I come tomorrow?

365
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,120
-I'll go
-Sorry

366
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,420
-I just need the address
-Sure

367
00:33:38,452 --> 00:33:40,940
We're going out, Maryam,
put out your cigarette

368
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:45,620
Pull your scarf forward.
Don't be noisy

369
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:48,300
-They stink of cigarettes
-Bye

370
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:51,300
-I told the hospital
-Hi Hamed

371
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:55,400
Come on guys, Hamed's time is valuable, 
not like us

372
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:00,140
Sara, you have to use sarcasm
I didn't even say anything

373
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,200
Yes

374
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:15,600
-Ask Narges to come
-Who?

375
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:20,120
-Ask Narges to come
-Which Narges?

376
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:24,560
-Safarkhani, ask her to come
-You are?

377
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:28,440
Her husband asked her to come

378
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,100
Wait here

379
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:39,680
-Don't shut the door
-I'll open it again, wait here

380
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,220
Wait

381
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:48,600
-Is he right?
-How did he find her?

382
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:51,820
-He didn't know you worked here?
-He's made her life a misery

383
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:55,760
-Let her talk
-Sorry I didn't mention it

384
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,660
I ran away three months ago.
Didn't tell my kids, either

385
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,700
She slept at the mosque.
I felt sorry for her, brought her here

386
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:08,240
I've taken him to rehab multiple times

387
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:11,480
He beats me up in front of my son-in-laws

388
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,720
He won't leave

389
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:18,060
-He remembered he has a wife now
-Fine, stop the drama

390
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,900
Leave this in my room and bring the shopping down

391
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,040
-Shut the door, don't let the girls out
-See what he does?

392
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,700
-This is my life
-Fine

393
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:31,880
-Let's talk see what he wants
-He says he's sorry, come back

394
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,540
He'll beat me up if I say no
It's not his first time

395
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:41,380
The father of my kids died so I married him

396
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:45,400
Talk to him, he might calm down

397
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:49,860
-I'll kill myself if he tries to take me
-Don't say that, Narges

398
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:53,040
He'll annoy the neighbours

399
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,420
Get lost

400
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:58,860
What are you watching?

401
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:02,700
Get inside and shut the door

402
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:08,060
Why do you make trouble?

403
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:13,540
Why is she here? What is this place?

404
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:18,140
-I'll explain
-There is nothing, she abandoned me

405
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:21,200
I want to see what her problem is
I'm going in

406
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:26,060
-You can't come in
-What's this place?

407
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,600
-What is it?
-Sir, wait

408
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,000
You can't, don't!

409
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,560
-Ask her to come out
-Listen

410
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:38,780
-You can file a complaint
-I will

411
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,720
-I'll show you all
-Good

412
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:45,640
You're hiding my wife

413
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:49,640
-Don't hit yourself
-Why do you hide my wife?

414
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:53,840
Just calm down a second

415
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,980
-I'll go see what I can do
-Go

416
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,040
-I'll ask her to come out
-Go

417
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:03,000
Sit here, sit down

418
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:15,400
He's lost it because of the drugs,
he's hallucinating

419
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,760
He'll kill me some day

420
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,280
-No one listens to me
-I do

421
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,980
I won't let him take you

422
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,840
Listen

423
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:34,060
I won't put up with him

424
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:40,100
You're helping us here, I'm saying
I might be able to convince him to go to rehab

425
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:44,340
-He might get better
-Get better?

426
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:49,120
-You don't know my problems
-Don't cry

427
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:52,980
-Don't cry, darling
-I lied

428
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:58,140
-What?
-I lied about the explosion

429
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:01,460
And I was burnt

430
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:05,300
He burnt me with boiling water

431
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,040
He burnt me

432
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:19,320
-He swore if I didn't go take him to court, he'd stop
-Get out!

433
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:24,120
I got out of hospital and went to the rehab centre

434
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,840
They said he only lasted three days.
What is it?

435
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,340
Get out

436
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,000
-Why did you abandon me?
-Kill me

437
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,140
-Why did you leave?
-What do you want?

438
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,600
-I swear I'll beat you up
-Do it

439
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,960
-Move!
-Do it

440
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:49,860
You think being a man is holding a knife?

441
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,260
Have you no morals?

442
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:57,480
See what you've done to her?
Here, look

443
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:00,640
Is this how you repay her
for not taking you to court?

444
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:04,520
You think you can do whatever you want 
because you're her husband?

445
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,800
Go inside, Narges

446
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,760
Go inside

447
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:31,080
I swear I'm sorry, Narges

448
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:35,360
I've no one, Narges

449
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,420
Narges, I lost it

450
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,720
I swear, I got angry

451
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,760
I don't know what got into me, Narges

452
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:49,320
I'm sorry, Narges

453
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:55,520
Come back, Narges, please

454
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:00,920
I've no one else

455
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,340
Yes

456
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:14,640
I understand, yes

457
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:17,340
I'm fine with it if you're okay

458
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,800
I'll try to pay the loan till the end of the week

459
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:26,080
Yes, you're welcome. Bye

460
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:30,900
Right here it says your husband
has his own business

461
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:35,300
-Why do you need a loan?
-To pay for my daughter's baby shower

462
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,400
What's happened to your face?

463
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,380
-It was burnt
-What?

464
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,380
It burnt in an explosion

465
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:47,060
Okay, it has to be confirmed

466
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:51,040
-Come see Miss Rasouli next week
-I work

467
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:55,880
-Miss Monshizadeh is my guarantor
-She's a real lady

468
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,740
I hope they agree

469
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,740
-Thanks
-You're welcome

470
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,740
Yes ma'am

471
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:10,800
She pushed in while you were on the phone

472
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,200
Told her story

473
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:20,420
I've come all the way here
and have to get back now

474
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:25,020
To go ask for our wages
with some other miserable souls like myself

475
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,840
God help you with that

476
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:32,260
You might be able to help

477
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:36,140
-What can we do for you here?
-My son was arrested

478
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:40,580
They say for him to be bailed out
we need to pay

479
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:44,560
I've nothing to my name 
or any rich relatives

480
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:49,220
-Help me
-What is his crime?

481
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:52,720
He's not a criminal, ma'am

482
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:57,900
-He's attended demonstrations
-He's being punished

483
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:01,400
-You should've stopped it
-He's done nothing wrong

484
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:05,880
He's not murdered anyone or stolen anything

485
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:10,080
I'm not the judge and we can't help you

486
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:13,980
Please help someone like me

487
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:19,700
Someone like me who doesn't own anything
has to lose her son?

488
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:27,000
Yes?

489
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,320
I checked the dates

490
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:35,240
Miss Rasouli, get her a glass of water, please

491
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,340
Yes sure

492
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,600
I wish you'd called earlier.
You're welcome

493
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,700
Hi

494
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:56,580
-Isn't there anyone else left?
-Whoever was supposed to be here, is here now

495
00:42:56,830 --> 00:43:00,600
We can go, pray for the driver

496
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:09,200
Wait, sir, Touba

497
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:12,060
Come

498
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,220
Come, Touba

499
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,300
Don't rush her, she'll get run over
Touba

500
00:43:38,996 --> 00:43:41,280
Excuse me! Move back a little, please
Thanks

501
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:49,260
-Hi Touba
-Hi

502
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:53,880
-Hi
-Hi Touba, why were you late?

503
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,000
Hi

504
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:59,260
Hope we get what we came for

505
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:10,700
If you go through the motorway
we won't be stuck in traffic

506
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:13,740
There's no difference

507
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:18,760
-Give me some water
-Let me give Touba some water first

508
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,620
Once we get there and get out of the van

509
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:26,620
You stand in a corner if anyone asks

510
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:28,840
No one answer, got it?

511
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:32,320
We'll wait for our elder to speak.
That's Touba

512
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,860
Ali is good too, he reads the papers

513
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:42,360
He cries well too

514
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:46,820
Mehdi, don't get mad

515
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:50,640
-You'll get us into trouble
-Fine

516
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:56,880
I just mean don't say anything
so they have an excuse

517
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:01,380
-Got it?
-Nothing changed

518
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:03,940
A letter means nothing to a worker

519
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:07,080
The worker, the boss

520
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:11,960
-Talk
-We've been hiding

521
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:15,080
-Don't be nervous
-Don't interrupt him

522
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,760
I'm nervous because of the camera

523
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:22,520
I wanted to say I've been hiding
in the house like a thief

524
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:26,160
-I'm afraid of them finding me
-You know what?

525
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:30,480
They sold the company three months ago
and told no one about it

526
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:35,180
The new owner wants to demolish it

527
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:40,660
The owner changed three times. 
Every time they fire the workers

528
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:45,040
Our boss says there's Chinese importation

529
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:47,900
I can't help it, control the borders

530
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:51,600
-Why should the worker pay for the loss?
-You did this last time

531
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:55,540
We need to take the legal route

532
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:58,540
We're not doing anything illegal right now

533
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,140
Here you go, director

534
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,720
-Will you put this on TV?
-I don't work for the TV

535
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,760
I had a job

536
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:11,600
My wife pays the expenses now

537
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:15,140
I need the money

538
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:20,320
I've not paid rent in four months.
What should I do?

539
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:23,080
Who should I ask for money?
He'll kick me out

540
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:25,960
Look at my hands, these are working hands

541
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:30,860
I swear I've worked hard 
to earn my money all these years

542
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:35,040
But I can't put food on the table

543
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:40,840
Look sir, we sent letters 
to all the different organisations

544
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,120
Who'll pay us? When?

545
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:47,100
We worked 17 years 
and this is our life now

546
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:50,520
-What do we do now?
-You tell him, Touba, you can talk

547
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:55,040
-What can she say?
-Haven't they filmed us before?

548
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:57,220
It might work this time

549
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:03,960
-Touba, tell him please
-I will

550
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:10,260
Those in charge, ladies, gentlemen

551
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:21,580
Whoever, wherever you are, 
I beg you to come see how we live

552
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:25,180
We were in debt when we had a job

553
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:28,280
Now that the company is shut down, it's worse

554
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:34,100
Some have to pay for the in-laws
and grandchildren

555
00:47:34,350 --> 00:47:36,660
He just got married recently

556
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:41,320
He got this job with hopes and dreams

557
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:45,920
We're under so much debt, what else do I say?

558
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:50,040
We're careful not to get into trouble

559
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:54,940
We're paid 40 tomans every month.
Our own money

560
00:47:55,190 --> 00:48:01,480
Thanks, but the prices have gone up like crazy

561
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:03,940
Water, electricity

562
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:15,000
If we'd told anyone else 
they'd feel sorry for us by now

563
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:20,320
-That's why I'm saying don't talk
-Let her talk

564
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:25,380
-You know better than her?
-They arrested my son a year ago

565
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:28,420
I don't own a house or a piece of land

566
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:36,900
I will, I'l say it all

567
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:42,220
I worked hard and paid for his uni.
Now he's unemployed

568
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:46,900
He's willing to do any job available

569
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:50,580
They ask him for contacts

570
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:53,980
Don't make it political, please

571
00:48:59,164 --> 00:49:02,420
I'm talking about my son. 
how is that about politics?

572
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:11,620
-I'm sorry
-They say he has to have different memberships

573
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:17,000
Thank god he's not into drugs

574
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:23,860
You can see on the streets 
how many innocent teenagers are into drugs

575
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:31,020
They use school kids to transport heroin

576
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:36,000
They always say it'll be fine, it won't

577
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:39,340
How will we survive?

578
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:47,780
I'm wandering around on the streets
for my son

579
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:52,580
I'm sure we'll all get into trouble for this

580
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:55,960
Who will you show these videos to?

581
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,980
Who'll see it?

582
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:02,720
Suppose they do see it

583
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:08,940
Where are you? What?

584
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:11,140
Why did you get back?

585
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:14,760
What?

586
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:18,600
-Why did they close the street off?
-Wait

587
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:21,540
We're on our way. Bye

588
00:50:22,832 --> 00:50:26,060
He says they sent the buses back
and closed off the street

589
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,420
-Let's get back
-Why? Where?

590
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:32,240
-You shouldn't have come
-Should I turn back?

591
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:36,220
Keep going, you get paid to go

592
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:41,900
-He's right too
-You're scared of their bluffs?

593
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:45,200
We're so small we can't even defend ourselves now

594
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:53,520
You can go back if you want, I'll go stand there
until someone asks me why

595
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,080
Don't make a fuss

596
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:03,720
Don't get me into trouble, please

597
00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:12,840
Don't say anything

598
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,460
Hi

599
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:25,340
Sure we'll move

600
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:28,000
Sure I'll go

601
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:32,020
-Hi good day
-Don't stop, move

602
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:35,080
Hi, good day

603
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:39,020
-He drove us here, we'll get off and he'll go back
-No

604
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:43,400
-You can't stand here
-We want to talk

605
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:47,920
Your representative can come talk later
Mo one gets off the bus

606
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:51,880
No one will see the rep.
Open the door

607
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:57,540
Ma'am, you're the wise one, 
ask them to get back

608
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:01,640
You take responsibility for their families
and I'll send them back

609
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:04,520
-Open the door
Stop it, ma'am

610
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:12,580
Leave

611
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:17,920
I want to know who can stop me

612
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:21,920
-Let him drive you back, don't cause trouble
-What trouble?

613
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:26,760
Don't you believe in God?
We're workers here

614
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:32,620
-We're here for our money
-Once I arrest you, you'll see

615
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:37,360
Why do you say that?

616
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:46,240
We're talking

617
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:06,120
Open the door, where are you taking him?

618
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:09,320
You have to take me too

619
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:12,740
You're the worst one

620
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:17,520
I don't care, open the door

621
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:21,400
Where are you taking him?

622
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:23,460
Camera!

623
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:27,320
Get the camera man out

624
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:48,320
-Dad, a man wants to see Mum
-What?

625
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:51,900
Who is it? It's not the landlord, is it?

626
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:54,660
No, it's a classy man

627
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,760
Hi

628
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:10,980
-Hi
-I want to see Mrs Nobar Kordani

629
00:54:11,230 --> 00:54:15,460
-I have to give her a letter
-What for?

630
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:19,520
A letter from Mr Rasoul Rahmani

631
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:23,720
I'm her husband

632
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:29,480
-What's the letter for?
-I'm Mr Rahmani's lawyer, it's about your wife

633
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:34,060
Do you understand? I'm her husband,
shouldn't I know what the letter is?

634
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:38,340
I didn't say you shouldn't, 
I said I have to hand it to her

635
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:40,820
Nobar isn't home

636
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:45,220
-How dare he send letters for a married woman
-Sir don't get angry

637
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:49,240
I must make sure Mrs Nobar Kordani gets this

638
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:53,200
You're her husband, you give it to her

639
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:58,400
Here's my card

640
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:02,060
-Bye
-Bye

641
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:30,200
-You forgot this
-What

642
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:33,460
-This
-Didn't I say not to touch it?

643
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:36,120
-Sorry
-Go away

644
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:21,760
Why did you leave the door open? Hi

645
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:24,580
Mum, come here

646
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:30,260
Dad is angry

647
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:33,900
Go do your homework

648
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:45,160
What's wrong?

649
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:49,380
Send the kid to Senobar

650
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:53,620
-What for?
-Farhad, go to your aunt's

651
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:58,220
He needs to do his homework
What's wrong?

652
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:04,400
Is this how you treat me?

653
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:08,800
-What do you mean?
-Was I a bad husband to you?

654
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:11,360
No

655
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:15,200
How long have you been
sending letters back and forth?

656
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:18,020
-To who?
-To who?

657
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:20,620
What's the letter?

658
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:26,540
Was I wrong to have married you
after 8 years?

659
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:31,840
Look Reza, don't bring this subject up again

660
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:35,080
Tell me what's wrong, Reza

661
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:39,940
You were always unfaithful to me
I refused to see it

662
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:44,440
Did I break up with you?

663
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:52,540
Everyone made fun of me saying "Of course
she'd pick the rich old man over you"

664
00:57:52,790 --> 00:57:55,260
-"Not you, who's a worker"
-To hell with them all

665
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:59,220
Would they support me and my siblings?

666
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:01,640
He lied to you

667
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:07,160
You've been looking down at me
since the day I arrived

668
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:10,220
-Was I wrong?
-Did I ask you to marry me?

669
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:14,740
-Was I wrong?
-You decided

670
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:18,740
-God saved your dead wife
-Shut up

671
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:22,360
-Haj Rasoul's temporary wife
-I was

672
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:26,240
Now I'm your wife and the mother of your kids, 
don't talk to me like that

673
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:31,780
It's fine for you to send letters 
to your ex-husband

674
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:36,140
I swear I've no idea 
whether the old man is dead or alive

675
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:38,540
What's this, then?

676
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:47,540
I don't know what it is

677
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:52,360
You don't? I felt sorry for you
when I married you

678
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,660
They used to say the old man
enjoyed his time with her

679
00:58:55,910 --> 00:59:00,700
Once he had a stroke, his daughters kicked her out 
and took their father abroad

680
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:03,540
-Read it, I want to know what it is
I don't know what it is

681
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,540
Do whatever you want

682
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:09,280
Don't do this, Reza

683
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:12,280
Why do you do this?

684
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:16,060
I'd never have to live under your roof
if I were lucky

685
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:23,500
-You're mental
-Yes, I am

686
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:26,260
Read it

687
00:59:26,870 --> 00:59:32,660
I swear I'll kill you if you miss anything
Read it

688
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:55,680
-Dear Nobar
-God help me

689
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:58,340
"Dear Nobar"

690
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:05,520
I have to sit here hear love letters 
someone else sent to my wife

691
01:00:07,530 --> 01:00:08,820
Read!

692
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:13,440
I hope you're well

693
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:17,340
I know that

694
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:21,580
You've married a decent man

695
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:24,620
And you're living in peace

696
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:29,880
You've told him everything, right?

697
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:34,140
-Reza, I swear I didn't know
-Shut up

698
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:36,720
Just read it

699
01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:44,740
I heard about your mother's death
in prison

700
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:53,580
God tests his favourite beings in this world

701
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:57,960
You were the most special angel

702
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:03,040
Angel! Look what he's calling you

703
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:05,700
Read!

704
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:13,980
My daughters tried to do me a favour

705
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:16,660
But they never knew

706
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:20,880
Happiness isn't something 
people would see from the outside

707
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:23,880
Happiness is in people's hearts

708
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:28,400
No one ever knew that

709
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:30,980
Other than you

710
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:57,820
Let me go, I don't want my kids to hear

711
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:02,860
You'd never do this 
if you cared about the kids

712
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:06,180
I didn't write to him

713
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:12,180
You probably thought I'm a miserable worker

714
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:14,920
He owns nothing in this world

715
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,980
If you knew me

716
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:25,260
You could tell I had no idea about him

717
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:33,360
Did your teacher give you
good comments on your work?

718
01:02:33,610 --> 01:02:36,720
-Are you okay?
-Yes love

719
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:40,460
I'm fine, darling

720
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:42,460
My lady

721
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:55,420
Shirin has fallen out with you

722
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:58,420
Come here

723
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:05,160
Can you read this to me?

724
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:10,700
Don't read the first part

725
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:14,420
-The handwriting is bad
-You can read it

726
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:20,940
-Happiness is in the heart
-Not there, further on

727
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:27,140
By the time you get this letter

728
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:30,900
I may no longer be alive

729
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:36,860
I ask of you, Nobar,

730
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:39,220
to forgive me

731
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:45,940
No one other than me believes

732
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:54,100
-That... what's this?
-Read the rest

733
01:03:55,170 --> 01:04:03,980
You've never cared about money

734
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:07,920
But let me

735
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:14,500
do this to die in peace

736
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:22,200
This is the smallest thing I wish for

737
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:25,840
A small house for you

738
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:34,620
I hope you accept this final request of mine

739
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:47,260
From someone who always prays 
for your new life with your family

740
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:53,160
Spring 2012

741
01:04:53,410 --> 01:05:01,940
In a place in this world that is not my home

742
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,780
We get a few a week like them

743
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:32,380
Why would a beautiful woman like yourself
want to commit suicide?

744
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:36,360
-You've a long life ahead of you
-Where's Sara?

745
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:39,460
-She'll come
-You'll be a bride

746
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:41,960
A mother, go up

747
01:07:43,050 --> 01:07:45,700
Give her a lot of liquids

748
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:49,260
-You'll feel dizzy a few days too
-Thanks, ma'am

749
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:51,260
You're welcome

750
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:58,900
-Thank you
-Put it back in your purse, ma'am

751
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:01,400
Look after your friend

752
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:05,860
My mother had the same problem
She died in the same way

753
01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:08,900
-Take care
-God rest her soul

754
01:08:09,770 --> 01:08:11,740
Shall we go?

755
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:14,880
Sorry for the wait

756
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:34,560
Did I say something wrong?

757
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:38,080
You didn't have to, I can see for myself

758
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:44,480
-Miss Arshad called and said
-Miss Arshad is off

759
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:49,160
-Miss Monshizadeh, I meant
-I talked to her

760
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:53,940
-Do you want to lay down?
-No

761
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:36,820
I don't want any

762
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:43,780
Will it be okay if I don't talk?

763
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:46,440
-Since you're tired
-I'm not tired

764
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:49,800
-You're tired and agitated
-I'm neither

765
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:52,320
Talk if you want, but...

766
01:09:52,570 --> 01:09:55,960
-Don't make fun of people
-When did I make fun of you?

767
01:09:56,210 --> 01:10:01,160
-I was saying
-Don't read a book, Hamed, talk

768
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:03,260
It's good for you

769
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:05,940
-Don't pick on the way I talk
-Now you're talking

770
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:11,740
-You made me forget what I was saying
-You're not a lecturer of literature

771
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:16,620
-You were supposed to be a mechanical engineer
-Isn't that making fun of me?

772
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:19,060
-You're not?
-You never became one, did you?

773
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:21,220
No I didn't, you're right

774
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:27,000
I'm a taxi driver

775
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:34,480
-Are you in pain?
-I want to go to bed

776
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,820
I have a horrible headache

777
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:41,860
-Do you have any water?
-I gave it to you

778
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:44,780
Water, I need water, Hamed

779
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:48,080
-I'll stop and get some
-No need

780
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:53,240
There was a bottle under this seat

781
01:10:53,490 --> 01:10:57,600
Let me see, sorry

782
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:02,440
If it has any water

783
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:19,440
I say

784
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:24,200
We're two people talking

785
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:26,540
There's no manifesto here

786
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:32,260
-You should let me speak, then
-Go on

787
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:36,580
-I said you're acting like an angel
-Oh man

788
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:40,240
You say let's talk, then use sarcasm

789
01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:43,600
You call me Mother Teresa

790
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:50,240
I swear, sorry I shouldn't have
used the word angel

791
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:54,580
-My point is, travel from this side of town to the other
-What's the problem?

792
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:58,440
-It's very good
-Thanks, right

793
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:02,020
I told you, you're stressed
Look at your face right now

794
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:08,440
Do you know what this is about, Hamed?

795
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:16,400
-You think since you've stood by a great cause
-What great cause

796
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:21,340
You were a student at the best university
You said something and stood by it

797
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:25,280
-You were expelled
-When did I ever mention that?

798
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:28,160
The entire centre knows

799
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:32,980
-Then don't say not to use sarcasm
-Sorry

800
01:12:33,790 --> 01:12:37,500
Since you've made a statement

801
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:40,880
You can't think no one else 
does anything important

802
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:49,540
-No one else can do anything good
-It's not a competition

803
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:57,500
With the energy and time you invest
you can do something bigger

804
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:03,840
-You can do something more important
-It's all a manifesto

805
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:06,020
-Why?
-It is

806
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:11,400
-Why do you act like I'm talking nonsense
-You're not, but...

807
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:16,780
-You say beautiful sentences
-Is that a problem?

808
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:23,600
You tell me what I need to do for them so I can do it

809
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:29,500
It's very simple, I define help in a different way

810
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:33,720
I say think of a situation

811
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:41,060
where so many like Samira wouldn't be homeless

812
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:44,460
How many of them overdose a day?

813
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:47,000
Commit suicide and die?

814
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:54,120
-No one even notices
-We can't do the big thing, so we don't help her either

815
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:56,000
-I didn't say that
-You did

816
01:13:56,250 --> 01:13:58,000
No I didn't

817
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:04,160
Hamed, let me just do my own thing

818
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,180
-Who's saying the beautiful stuff now?
-I am

819
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:09,080
You do the important stuff

820
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:14,600
If I do all this

821
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:18,100
-I do it for myself
-Fine!

822
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:22,140
One minute, let me ask this

823
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:24,680
-It makes you happy?
-Yes

824
01:14:24,930 --> 01:14:26,620
-Do it, then
-Fine

825
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:29,700
I'm saying don't forget about yourself

826
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:34,300
-I'm not saying anything bad
-No, but it seems like it

827
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:38,660
-What can you see?
-The way you talk

828
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:43,340
-The way you talk
-I need to smoke

829
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:47,960
Can I have your lighter?

830
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:51,840
You smoke a lot

831
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:56,620
We smoked once on our way here
and on the way back

832
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:06,000
Sorry for all the smoke and the blood in your car

833
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:10,940
Do it but don't attack me

834
01:15:15,490 --> 01:15:19,900
Why don't you do something 
related to your degree?

835
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:23,360
What's with the taxi?

836
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:26,320
Very good suggestion!

837
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:30,300
I wonder how I never thought of it myself

838
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:35,960
You talk like you don't live here
What job?

839
01:15:35,968 --> 01:15:38,680
You studied for three years,
do something with that

840
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:43,220
Why do you think I've made a promise to myself?

841
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:48,660
Forget education, work as a taxi driver
or private tuition

842
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:55,300
Work at the centre once in a while

843
01:15:55,550 --> 01:16:05,320
-To pay for my family
-But you like this educated taxi driver phase too

844
01:16:05,570 --> 01:16:07,700
Why do you say that?

845
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:10,740
Don't say that

846
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:24,420
You've always lived the way you'd wished

847
01:16:24,670 --> 01:16:29,160
Me and so many others lived the way we had to

848
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:34,360
The way I decided to live wasn't an easy way

849
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:38,980
I went wrong and I have to pay for it

850
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:43,200
Never said it was easy, 
that's why you don't look like you should

851
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:46,800
What should I look like for it to suit me?

852
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:51,340
-I didn't say it had to be a certain way
-Actually you do

853
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:55,960
You think this is a strange place, 
you're different, I've been here

854
01:16:56,210 --> 01:17:01,380
-You could be too
-Thank god, I didn't

855
01:17:01,630 --> 01:17:04,160
-You're so happy you weren't
-Should I be upset?

856
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:10,180
You've no image of being in rehab

857
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:14,260
-But I can understand
-What can you understand?

858
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:16,320
How can you?

859
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:22,560
I'm not saying I'm big because I quit.
They're doing a bigger thing

860
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:27,900
Everyone knows...

861
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:32,440
What an important thing you've done

862
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:36,800
You must've had a strong will
and not everyone can do it

863
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:45,260
Definitely not, there are many who want to quit 
but can't because they don't have the support

864
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:49,620
That's my point, the support

865
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:52,340
Give me the chance to speak

866
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:57,780
Hamed, when I did this to myself

867
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:01,180
I had the luck of my mum being there

868
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:05,520
Took me to different clinics
and doctors till I quit

869
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:08,540
-Fine
-Sorry for the support I had

870
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:15,180
Since I had the support 
I shouldn't help those who don't

871
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:18,540
Who said not to?

872
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:23,820
-The value for...
-Value! Hamed, what are you saying?

873
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:27,060
Value for what? Stop defining the values

874
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:30,540
My value is in quitting

875
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:34,720
You don't give me the chance to speak

876
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:37,000
We're there

877
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:42,540
"I quit, I quit" didn't you quit 
to get back to normal life?

878
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:44,660
Live it, then

879
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:49,400
You keep talking about it
then tell me I give out manifestos

880
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:58,360
You're not willing to look around you

881
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:03,920
I think you haven't quit yet
You're still in rehab

882
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:10,460
-How can someone abandon herself like that?
-What's your point, Hamed?

883
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:15,160
-I am
-Say the main thing, we're almost there

884
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:21,640
-I am, I said
-Do you like me?

885
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:27,960
-Excuse me?
-Do you like me?

886
01:19:32,490 --> 01:19:37,300
-What a question
-It's not odd, it's a yes or no. Do you like me?

887
01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:46,140
-Don't be afraid, answer
-Why afraid?

888
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:52,060
If you can even say things like that 
to someone like Sara

889
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:57,220
-You ask the question then answer it yourself
-You're right, go on

890
01:19:57,470 --> 01:20:00,620
-Go on
-Fine, give me a moment

891
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:03,660
It's not an interrogation

892
01:20:10,330 --> 01:20:14,220
Look, I don't know, maybe

893
01:20:14,890 --> 01:20:20,500
-I was thinking
-If you have to think, then it's clear

894
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:26,140
Did you hear me tell her I like her?

895
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:29,460
You didn't say you didn't

896
01:20:29,870 --> 01:20:35,480
-I didn't talk
-You don't talk, I made you say what you did

897
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:43,680
Sometimes in life we need answers...

898
01:20:44,110 --> 01:20:49,280
that make things clear

899
01:20:49,530 --> 01:20:53,280
Have you ever experienced this sort of thing?

900
01:20:54,610 --> 01:20:57,260
It's clear to me

901
01:20:57,510 --> 01:21:02,300
Suppose I'm in that position

902
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,680
You have to ask questions if you need answers

903
01:21:04,930 --> 01:21:06,900
-I'll ask
-Ask

904
01:21:07,150 --> 01:21:09,520
-What about you?
-What about me?

905
01:21:10,570 --> 01:21:14,400
-I asked
-What about you isn't a question

906
01:21:14,710 --> 01:21:22,100
I'm asking, have you ever thought of me?

907
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:27,120
No

908
01:21:29,370 --> 01:21:34,060
-No means you've not thought of me
-No

909
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:43,580
You don't like me

910
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:46,320
No

911
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:50,300
Is it done?

912
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:54,920
I don't know, is it?

913
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:57,780
Done

914
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:18,280
-Look, it can't
-Look, Hamed

915
01:22:18,530 --> 01:22:21,960
I dragged the conversation here

916
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:25,960
so you'd answer and I'd say this

917
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:28,600
and it'd all be clear to you

918
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:35,800
Thanks for making it all clear to me at once

919
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:38,940
-But I have questions
-I don't want to talk anymore

920
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:43,860
-I don't want to talk
-You have to, I have a question

921
01:22:43,916 --> 01:22:49,500
The no you said, am I the problem?

922
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,492
-Or are you?
-What difference does it make?

923
01:22:51,496 --> 01:22:54,640
It makes a difference, answer my question

924
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:59,480
If the problem is me, then I have nothing to say

925
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:08,140
Suppose I'm the problem

926
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:14,280
If you're the problem

927
01:23:15,170 --> 01:23:19,480
-It's fine
-What is?

928
01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:24,620
You think I've not thought about it?

929
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:30,180
To see whether it's possible...

930
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:32,860
If I can or not

931
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:38,160
Whether it's possible for us

932
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:44,180
I know

933
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:48,440
What do you know?

934
01:23:55,050 --> 01:23:59,760
Sara, should I know more than

935
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:03,540
you can

936
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:10,540
You can tend to Samira's wounds

937
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:16,500
Who's a HIV positive patient without gloves?

938
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:46,760
Is it fine?

939
01:25:30,570 --> 01:25:34,040
Yeah, no, that's over for now

940
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:37,620
They gave me the camera back.
No, it's fine

941
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:39,900
I'm used to it

942
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:42,440
Of course I'm still working

943
01:25:42,690 --> 01:25:45,680
Listen

944
01:25:45,930 --> 01:25:49,240
No movie has ever stayed hidden

945
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:54,060
It's screened somewhere somehow,
whether we're there or not

946
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:57,780
Yeah I know, I understand
