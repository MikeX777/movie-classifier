What made you apply

00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:58,879
- Don't touch me!
- I know, I am sorry.

18
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,282
- Dad, stop this!
- Out of the way, kid!

19
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:11,092
Mom, mom...

20
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,404
What the hell are you doing here?

21
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:29,412
Hey, Young-jun...

22
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,483
You killed mom!

23
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,187
Oh, your father is a cop too?

24
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:38,490
No, sir, I don't have a father!

My New Partner

26
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:09,888
They are coming in.

27
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,488
- How about the square?
- Clear, at 9 o'clock.

28
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:17,084
- Detective Cha, come in.
- Clear at 12 o'clock.

29
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,290
- Chil-sun?
- No problem, sir.

30
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,493
Great, all units,
keep them in sight, period.

31
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,908
- Hey, Min-seok.
- Oh, you are here!

32
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,005
Oh, thanks a lot,
you did a greatjob.

33
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,082
But I am afraid... there'll
be trouble in the future.

34
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,186
No, not a chance!
I got connection in the information bureau.

35
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,390
- Young-jun, do you want an ice cream cone?
- No, thanks, I've got trouble with my teeth.

36
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,387
Oh, you are too young to be troubled with that,
take care, buddy.

37
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,893
I know...

38
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:54,993
Take it.

39
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,799
Just out of curiosity... What do you
need that confidential file for?

40
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,406
Why Narcotics Dept?

41
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:11,883
Who did you got this for?
Let me say hello to the big shot!

42
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,281
Young-jun...

43
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,882
You got any idea
what's in this ice cream?

44
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,891
Damn detergent materials!

45
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:25,486
But we are crazy about it, why?

46
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,996
People don't know it.

47
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,395
Dad...

48
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,597
Hey, Seok-hyun...

49
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:38,201
Let's go on the roller coaster!

50
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,413
It's this boy's birthday,

51
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,809
thanks again.

52
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,185
So, you got your dream come true!

53
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,085
Coming in at the 2nd section.

54
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:57,896
Out of sight!

55
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,396
We've lost him in my section too.

56
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,193
- Come in, Detective Kim!
- No, not in here.

57
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,801
I got him.

58
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,198
But the envelope is gone!

59
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,006
Get him!

60
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,101
Damn!

61
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,186
Take care, boy.

62
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,882
Let me keep the gun for you.

63
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,893
Seok-hyeon, sorry
but I want to ride first.

64
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,997
Could you leave us, kid?

65
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,098
Thanks...

66
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,200
Hey, what's with you?

67
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,503
Oh, excuse me.

68
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,002
Min-seok, who did you meet
on the way here?

69
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,914
What did you do with the stuff
I had given you?

70
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,775
Leave this place empty.

71
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,346
I am really sorry.

72
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,592
Spit it out,
who the hell was that bastard?

73
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,991
It means... you are a rat
from the interior affairs?

74
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,690
The ice cream tastes good
'cause we don't know what's in there?

75
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,701
But you knew it and
you shouldn't have eaten it.

76
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,394
Young-jun, you slimy informer!

77
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,785
Now you're proven to be a dirty cop
in front of your son, and...

78
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,786
How does he feel about that,
especially on his birthday?

79
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,687
Please, I'm begging you.
Let me off this time.

80
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,193
It's all for my son's operation,
you know that.

81
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,291
I won't forget it,
if you let me go this time.

82
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,798
This fucking cop gives me only a penny,
and my son is dying!

83
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,005
Nothing can spare you from
being punished for your crimes.

84
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,613
The train is leaving now.

85
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,678
Out of my way!

86
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,880
Don't let him go!

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,399
Hey, go that way!

88
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,398
Stop the damn thing!

89
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,802
No, I can't once it starts,
we can't stop it.

90
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,801
Min-seok, it's dangerous,
let's get down.

91
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,899
Fuck off, you rat!

92
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,204
It's over.

93
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:04,883
You are not a cop,
you're a police dog!

94
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:09,181
We put our lives on the line,
and you turn them in?

95
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,084
No!

96
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,784
Minseok, don't do this.

97
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,288
You know this doesn't help
anything at all.

98
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,795
You want this, don't you?

99
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,210
Young-jun,

100
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,376
I have thought of you as...

101
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,895
What a police dog he is!

102
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,592
I warned Young-jun,
and look,

103
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,202
the idiot screwed everything up.

104
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:40,999
Being this dog's partner would be
the creepiest nightmare ever.

105
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,404
I should be careful 24-7,
in case this dog smells something.

106
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,702
You shouldn't do anything fishy
in the beginning.

107
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,608
Don't get me wrong,
I didn't mean that I do that!

108
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,272
Well, I mean...

109
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,376
What a bunch of shitheads!

110
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,783
You a whole squad
lost this one bastard!

111
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,482
Do I have to remind you
killing this jerk doesn't help at all?

112
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,984
We got nothing,
not a fucking thing!

113
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:06,086
Young-jun, you worked undercover
for 6 months, and what is it you got?

114
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,094
Wait, I got something here.

115
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,402
Look at this.

116
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,009
He has the envelope in this photo.

117
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,582
But in the next photo,
he doesn't have it anymore.

118
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,580
This girl could be the answer.

119
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,188
After she's gone,
so is the thing.

120
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,696
It's her.

121
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:57,374
It turns out this girl is Yu-ri,
who is supposed to be in Busan.

122
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:01,278
The Public Morals Dpt., Busan
is already after her.

123
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,088
I will dispatch you
as a narcotics agent.

124
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:10,185
You get the girl,
and we'll get the dirty insider.

125
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,392
Make sure you don't
make the second mistake.

126
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,006
The Public Morals Dpt.

127
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:28,612
You ran away from home and
commitjuvenile delinquency?

128
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:33,478
No, I didn't do it.

129
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,589
Oh, please sit still,
I am doing it right.

130
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,390
See, it works.

131
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,088
Give it another try,

132
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,393
how many times did I tell you
how to do this, you idiot!

133
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:52,903
You know what? We're going to have a screwball
from the Seoul Agency come in!

134
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,005
Who do you mean?

135
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,608
A young kid cop from Seoul!

136
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,609
That punk is a lieutenant!

137
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:03,010
The kids, from the police academy,
are all 'a really know it all'

138
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,584
Who is that kid?

139
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,283
Oh, it hurts, take it easy, Ginger.

140
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:12,083
- Oh, I'm lost, how can I untie this?
- What a fool!

141
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:16,090
Hello, Lieutenant,
do you want some coffee?

142
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,689
No, thanks.

143
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,691
Oh, how embarrassing!

144
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:26,703
Sir, you are here for the Yu-ri case, right?

145
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:27,999
We got the fax, already.

146
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,199
Hey, Ginger,
where did you put the fax?

147
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,503
- Look, I told you, it's on your desk.
- Oh, now I remember.

148
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,510
How stupid and absent minded...

149
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:37,072
Ginger, please untie this.

150
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,480
Sorry, but I don't know
how to untying it yet.

151
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,082
I don't know how to untie this!

152
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:49,986
Oh, thank you, sir.

153
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,495
The Chief is coming soon.

154
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:55,395
I am Detective Bae ll-gwon.

155
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,593
Nice to meet you
I am Kang Young-jun.

156
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:01,001
It's been nice talking with you, please excuse me
but I have to go back to work.

157
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,303
I told you not to touch
anything, stupid!

158
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,590
Oh these fuckers are so quick!

159
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,694
I feel like we're not going to be
lucky this time either.

160
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,004
That's him, get him!

161
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,294
Oh, thanks.

162
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:05,603
Look at you!
Young-jun, my son.

163
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,974
How have you been?

164
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,379
Aren't you happy to see your dad?
It's been eight years!

165
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,387
No, it's been seven years?

166
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,190
Let me see, how old are you?

167
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,503
Are you still single?

168
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,906
You didn't get married, did you?

169
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:51,082
When I was at your age, my son,
you were in elementary school!

170
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,184
Tell me how far you are on this case.

171
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:59,382
Should we talk about work, when it's been
8 years since we saw each other last?

172
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,288
Yes, I believe we should.

173
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,896
Chief Kang.

174
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,805
Okay, let's go, Lieut. Kang.

175
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,607
It's work, right?

176
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,507
Let's have a meeting.

177
00:16:23,415 --> 00:16:29,081
I got something for you,
about Kang, the chief of this Dpt.

178
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,786
Well... no, it's not suspicious yet
but for reference.

179
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,386
His tax payment,
and other personal data,

180
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,589
yes, thanks.

181
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,300
Have a good night.

182
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,300
Thank you.

183
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:52,205
It's been ages since we had a casual dinner,
how I've been missing this!

184
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,811
Let's have a drink.

185
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:02,476
This kid, my son, works for
the Narcotics Dpt. Of the Seoul Agency.

186
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,088
- You know about the Yu-ri case, right?
- Sure I do.

187
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,987
He works on it, too.
You guys know

188
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,491
what to do to make sure
he's set up.

189
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,095
No problem, sir, whose son is he?

190
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,993
I apologize for my stupid action
this afternoon.

191
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,397
Once we get Yu-ri,
the fist phase will be done.

192
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,096
Then we'll get more info
and transfer it

193
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:20,500
to the Central Police Agency.

194
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,802
Sure, we work for public morals, so...

195
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:26,308
We catch the small fish and send them
upstairs to the head office.

196
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,310
- Oh, let's have a drink.
- Sure.

197
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,709
- Il-gwon!
- Yes, sir.

198
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,078
Where does your hunch say she is?

199
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,787
It says, she's in 'somewhere'.

200
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,185
Female hot tub,

201
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:44,886
considering it's a she.
And I am a she.

202
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,797
Great! You search in every nook and cranny,
in the hot steaming tubs.

203
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,802
Wait, I assume you have a problem
with who's in charge...

204
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,198
As long as I'm on the case,
you will take orders from me.

205
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,709
Sorry, I forgot my son is officially
higher ranked than you!

206
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,006
Whatever your boss says...

207
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,377
We say, "Yes, sir"
and we do it, sir.

208
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,780
That reminds of a funny question.

209
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,581
If a son is higher ranked than
his father...

210
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,690
Should his father call him 'sir'?

211
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:18,786
You dumb ass, does the
president's father call his son 'sir'?

212
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,492
They go by first names,
they are family!

213
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,000
I know I'd have known something more,
but I met the girl.

214
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:30,302
That son of a bitch made me
steaming mad...

215
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,501
Sorry, I will call you back later.

216
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,606
Young-jun, forgive me
for not saying hello earlier...

217
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,979
I am Young-cheol, bro.

218
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,686
- Hello.
- You want a light?

219
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:50,886
It's a beautiful night,
isn't it, bro?

220
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:56,899
Can I call you bro, like we were brothers?
I'm younger than you.

221
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,403
I know what's on your mind.
I look old, don't I?

222
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,907
Butjust using a brother basis is
fun and easy, right?

223
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,103
Detective Kang does
a betterjob for me.

224
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,681
I see, Detective Kang.

225
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:15,483
You feel so familiar to me,
because the boss has said

226
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,782
so much about you...

227
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,593
What department do you belong to?

228
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,291
No, I don't belong anywhere.
I am on my own.

229
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,194
How can a marked man like me be a cop?

230
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,996
The Boss has taken care of me

231
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,900
since my juvenile reformatory days.

232
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:37,406
Some scumbags are even envious of me...

233
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,808
They screwed their lives up
and tried to screw up mine too!

234
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:44,973
They treat me as if
I am a police informant.

235
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:48,581
Here comes the fish dish!

236
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,485
Hey, guys, listen to me, all right?

237
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:56,890
When it comes to investigation,
the number one thing is team work.

238
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:01,591
In baseball what hitter numbers
are most important?

239
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:02,893
Four and five!

240
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,798
Three and four?

241
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,405
How many are there? I go by!!

242
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,598
You don't count! And you?

243
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:10,799
Idiot!

244
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,106
3, 4, 5 are the best hitters
in every team.

245
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,009
But here is the catch...

246
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,275
For them to do the best that they can,
2 and 6 should play their roles.

247
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,783
So, this case is the same.

248
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,786
You, number 2 and 6,
do your shit perfect, okay?

249
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,787
- If not...
- One more fish please!

250
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,585
If not, it'd be one more fish!

251
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,294
- Damn, where the hell was I?
- No idea!

252
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:37,197
So I was...

253
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,301
Have fun, guys.

254
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,108
Gyu-hwa, don't rush, have a seat,
and talk awhile...

255
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,304
No, thanks, you just keep
having a good time.

256
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,805
Hey, Young-jun!

257
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:54,147
This is Gyu-hwa, the woman I am hot for,
and Young-cheol's sister, say hello.

258
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,483
In case she could be your step mom.

259
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,692
Oh, was my joke too much?

260
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:04,785
I don't think it was a joke
for the son you haven't met in ages!

261
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,693
I feel sorry for that.

262
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:10,693
Just get yourjob done by tomorrow.
I need to know all about Yu-ri.

263
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,099
Hey.

264
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,610
Hey, Young-jun, wait!

265
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,480
What's with you?

266
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,987
I don't get it, you brought
the ex-criminal's ass into this, why?

267
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:33,491
Oh, the rule is
a rat smells rats better.

268
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,593
He's a Busan kid to the backbone,

269
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,888
without him,
we'd have nothing done.

270
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,691
What the hell are you talking about?

271
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,199
Being a cop is a joke for you?

272
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,100
You even have a thug,
as your man, and he helps you?

273
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,797
Don't brag in front of me!
I'm more experienced than you!

274
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,601
And what a bad attitude
in front of my men!

275
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:52,505
You mean 'bad attitude'?

276
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,709
You think I should've hugged
my "will-be" step mom?

277
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:59,777
- Oh, I was joking.
- What kind of a joke was that?

278
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,977
You caused mom to die and now what?

279
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,686
- Young-jun, let's get back to the dinner.
- Don't call me Young-jun any more.

280
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,995
Young-jun, your son,
doesn't exist in me any more.

281
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,390
And my dad doesn't
exist to me any more.

282
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,899
What made you come to Busan then?

283
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,997
You show up, stir shit up,
and try to screw me!

284
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,505
If it's not for work,
I should leave right away.

285
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:27,009
Then just go, I'm not happy being
with a brat like you anyways!

286
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,590
Hello, let's go and get breakfast.

287
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,191
No, thanks, not now.

288
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,097
Oh, I knew you would say that!

289
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,101
Let's go, it's an order!

290
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,306
- Did you have a good night?
- Sure.

291
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,474
Please keep your hands off.

292
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:40,380
The Chief told me to
make sure you get there.

293
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:42,783
I won't run away,
so please let me go on my own.

294
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,889
Why... it feels great.

295
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,991
Thanks!

296
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:51,193
It was a great meal!

297
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:52,489
Have a nice day.

298
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,394
Thanks.

299
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:00,303
Detective Kang,
do you have a girl friend?

300
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,203
I know Seoul chicks
are really hot right?

301
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,504
The report says you come here
looking for a pimp!

302
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,409
- Does it have anything to do with Yu-ri?
- Oh, do you mean Jang Byeong-sam?

303
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,278
He used be a big pimp...

304
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:15,181
I take it his business
includes drug dealing.

305
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,288
- But I heard it doesn't any more.
- Oh, really?

306
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:19,982
Chances are he could've gotten
in touch with Yu-ri.

307
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,889
I and Young-jun are
after Byeong-sam...

308
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:26,395
You two trying to
get Yu-ri's whereabouts.

309
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:27,691
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

310
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:32,202
Sorry but I am on my own,
Chief Kang, you join them.

311
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,602
On your own?
Aren't you a newcomer to Busan?

312
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,900
You just ask anybody on the street,

313
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,408
"Do you know Yu-ri?"?

314
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,912
Like it or not, you are my new partner.

315
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:00,693
Have you ever seen this girl?

316
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,895
Look at the photo!

317
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,601
Byeon Du-su!

318
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:10,708
Du-su!

319
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,507
Oh, damn!

320
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,687
Do you wanna
go to the movies, sweetie?

321
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:30,693
You mean you didn't see her, right?

322
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:32,796
Detective Dung Fly.

323
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,181
When you were a kid, we went fishing.
And all I ever caught were minnows!

324
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,880
- Have you heard of Byeong-sam?
- Do you now this guy?

325
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,689
Let's take a break!

326
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,493
All these steep hills
are killing me!

327
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:13,400
My legs are aching,
it will rain any minute.

328
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:16,507
I mean it, the rain will come
from that direction.

329
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:21,301
I miss Young-cheol. He piggybacks me
whenever my legs are aching.

330
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,880
Then let the idiot be your partner.

331
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,581
My knees are aching to hell;
it's a weathercast for rain!

332
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,589
Hey, miss, can I ask you something?

333
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,894
To start I am not a "miss".

334
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:42,499
Oh, sorry,
Mr, do you know this guy?

335
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:47,999
Sure, I do.
He's usually around here.

336
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,601
No one in this area is
unaware of thatjerk.

337
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:54,305
He is the moron who walks
the mongrel every morning!

338
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:56,878
Is he wanted?

339
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,778
Not really.

340
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,578
I just want to know where he lives.

341
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,482
Ah...

342
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,991
First, look to the
11 o'clock direction.

343
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,685
There's a house thats roof is
much higher than the others.

344
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,386
I see it, the house like a pinnacle.

345
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,692
Right, its pinnacles protrude like that...

346
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:16,300
Yeah, right.

347
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:19,494
I want to know who lives there!

348
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:27,104
Go straight that way to the stairs.

349
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:29,976
If you take the stairs...

350
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:32,879
You will meet a girl with long hair,
sitting on the way.

351
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,679
Just ignore her,
she's a psycho bitch!

352
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:38,585
Just go up the stairs
and at the end,

353
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,588
- you will see two paths.
- Let me make it clear.

354
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:43,091
Go up the stairs

355
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,890
and at the end turn right?
And don't give a shit about the insane girl.

356
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,293
- Oh, you got it right.
- I see.

357
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:51,892
- And then the house is the second from the end.
- I see, thanks.

358
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,095
Ask any one there.

359
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:56,002
The town chief lives there.

360
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,404
Damn.

361
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:01,706
Look, his mongrel is there.

362
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:12,085
You mongrel, where is your house?

363
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:13,884
Look at me, mutt!

364
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:17,483
Show me where you live,
you dirty dog!

365
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:19,389
Or I will make you unhappy.

366
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:22,494
What are you doing with that dog?

367
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:25,102
If he feels threatened, he will run
to the bastards'house,

368
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:26,703
follow me.

369
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:49,690
Oh, hello, how have you been?

370
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:59,189
Alra mantra sutra ultra...

371
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,906
15!

372
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,674
Is this bad timing?

373
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,784
I'm completely clean, no gambling!

374
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:20,842
"How to be the best gambler"
I'm completely clean, no gambling!

375
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,078
No more whoring!

376
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,189
No more drugs.

377
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,291
No more cops, I hope.

378
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,689
Oh, I can read your mind.

379
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,592
But I was tipped off by Yu-ri.

380
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,167
Your hunch doesn't smell right this time,
Detective Dung Fly.

381
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,499
I don't deal drugs any more.
She said she got her shit from me?

382
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,197
Where is Yu-ri now?

383
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:48,302
Don't butt into this
professional conversation.

384
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:52,574
Being dumped into prison
four times gave me a huge lesson...

385
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:57,086
Buddha says...
CAY, FUE

386
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,282
"When Cops Ask You,
Fess Up Everything!"

387
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:04,486
It's what I told you
when I put you in prison the last time!

388
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:08,196
You have seen Yu-ri, haven't you?

389
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:11,299
You Detective are a Buddha to me...

390
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,301
She said she'd be at the spar.

391
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:17,397
When I get dope,
she wants me to call her.

392
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,802
I said don't butt in!

393
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:26,479
You see? I am completely
refreshingly fresh!

394
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:27,983
- Sure I do.

395
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,883
Fresh!

396
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:38,187
Four separations and four prisons;
how about 44!

397
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:49,297
Deep-rooted trees don't break easy.

398
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:54,801
44! 44!

399
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:58,074
Four times four is sixteen.

400
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:01,185
Four plus four is eight.

401
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:06,679
You should've pushed him more;
this is how you do yourjob?

402
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:11,284
He's got nothing more,
I smelt it all out.

403
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,693
No wonder you go by dung fly.

404
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:17,096
So I am a dung fly,
and he's the dung, shit!

405
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,997
What do you think, dung fly?

406
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,996
I am a fly, you're my son
and you're a fly too!

407
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,882
See? I told you it would rain!
What a forecast!

408
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,778
It's so cool!

409
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,393
Hey, Ginger!

410
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,693
I got here, where are you?

411
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:52,497
And the chief?

412
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,003
Ah, I passed it, damn.

413
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,078
Fuck you!

414
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:06,183
- Oh, I see.
- So you've not seen her for a long time?

415
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,376
Where is this bitch hiding her ass?

416
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,085
Where is Yu-ri?

417
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:13,782
I can't see her now.
I am working on it.

418
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,890
Hey, Kim, you got something
in your hands?

419
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,078
Signed by Chanho Park!

420
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:49,123
Baseball match tickets

421
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:55,097
It feels like they rushed
out of the place.

422
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,898
Byeong-sam must have informed her.

423
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,801
They say it's been days
since they saw her.

424
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,202
It's a hell of a dirty place!

425
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,946
Invitation to a VIPparty at Aqua World.
What a fucking mess!

426
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:09,810
Invitation to a VIPparty at Aqua World.

427
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:11,481
Where is this?

428
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:15,975
Aqua World?
It's a new facility at the beach.

429
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,486
I heard it's so classy.

430
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:22,081
I will fit in there!

431
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:26,191
Let's go.

432
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:30,897
You mean to the party?
Oh, no, we don't need to!

433
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:33,799
Don't you see VIP written on it?

434
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,304
No need to work on the VIPs!

435
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,710
Okay, we will go there tomorrow night.
Lieut. Kang.

436
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,878
- Ginger, you work on it.
- Yes, sir.

437
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,992
Wow, it's an eye-popping place!
Oh, sorry.

438
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:59,596
- It's a whole different world!
- Are you serious?

439
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:03,598
I don't think I'll fit in there,
because I'm used to being with dirty scumbags.

440
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:06,794
Boss, and Young-jun,
please let me come with you,

441
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,996
I am begging you!

442
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:10,004
Those chicks are almost naked!

443
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:12,302
Please don't leave me out!

444
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:16,311
Young-cheol, fart blossoms,
you won't blend in there.

445
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,883
- Isn't Ginger here yet?
- She didn't call yet?

446
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,982
She sent a message to come now.
Young-jun, go.

447
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,086
Take care of yourself,

448
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,284
Whatever happens you, call...

449
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:51,977
Hey, darling.

450
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:04,586
We are a couple, all right?

451
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,391
It's 100% official, don't worry.

452
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,092
Special ID is a must here.

453
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,199
I made you a doctor,
from Busan hospital.

454
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,498
You should've told me that earlier!

455
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,601
And what's worse... Do you
really think I look like a doc?

456
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,803
Yes I do.

457
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,275
Please show us your ID.

458
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,576
I'm Dr. Kang from Busan Hospital.

459
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,381
Thank you sir, have a good time.

460
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:34,381
So what are you disguised as?

461
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,187
A beauty contest
third place winner in 2004.

462
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:41,196
Do you think that makes sense?
You could be the first place winner!

463
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:44,298
Oh, I know when to stop!

464
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:52,106
Stop drinking. In case
you don't know, we are on duty!

465
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:56,509
Don't you know this
costs more than 500,000 won?

466
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,979
This is a chance in a lifetime
to get some damn good booze.

467
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,981
And you don't make a face.

468
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,587
You are wearing
'I am an undercover cop' dress!

469
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:09,191
And you are holding me too tight...

470
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,895
Hands away from my ass!

471
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:14,497
I'll report you for sexual harassment!

472
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:19,296
I'm not doing this because
I like you, don't get it wrong.

473
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:25,400
Your real name is Ginger?

474
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:29,206
Yah, my father named me.

475
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,680
When I was young, I was made fun
of all the time for that.

476
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:36,975
But now it's much better,
it sounds stronger.

477
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:42,788
It's a cop's name,
it's much better than Lake, Sky...

478
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:49,797
What?

479
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,801
I told you, it's a once
in a life time chance, cheese!

480
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,405
We are a couple.

481
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,801
Smile.

482
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,387
Are you a doctor
from Busan hospital?

483
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:14,791
Oh, yes...

484
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:17,189
How is the chairman Yu,

485
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:20,292
you should have come with him!

486
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:24,893
He's stuck with an urgent operation.

487
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:32,898
He loses his temper easily,
so tough to work with.

488
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,779
But working for patients
is tough anyhow.

489
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:43,182
Do you know
all these people at the party?

490
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,181
Well, I could say,
I know most of them...

491
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,584
Do you know a girl,
called Yu-ri?

492
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:56,098
Yu-ri? I never heard
of that name.

493
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:00,597
How do you know each other?

494
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:06,801
I once met her at a party,
so I am expecting to see her again.

495
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,679
Excuse me,
nice talking with you.

496
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,884
You have a beautiful woman
and you're looking for another?

497
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,690
See you later.

498
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,209
Come down here, honey!

499
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,377
Sorry.

500
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:55,185
Oh, I am sorry.

501
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,584
What's going?

502
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,091
Stop, sir.

503
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,292
Can I help you sir?

504
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,801
Let me in.

505
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,802
Only the staff is allowed
to come in from this entrance.

506
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,100
I am a cop.
Let me in for a moment.

507
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:45,401
What's going on there?

508
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:47,101
Oh, Prosecutor Park.

509
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:48,506
He said he's a cop.

510
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,170
A cop?

511
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:54,382
You don't see Parliamentary men
up there, do you?

512
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,583
How dare you make a mess
out of nothing?

513
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:58,983
Hey, calm down,

514
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,681
hello, Mr Park.

515
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,588
Nice to meet you sir.

516
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,792
- Hey, Kang.

517
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,988
I will come after you.

518
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:09,497
Does this jerk belong to you?

519
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,193
Is this how your men work?

520
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,106
How cocky he's saying he'll
search around the private property.

521
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,606
- It won't take long.
- What? You bastard.

522
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,210
No, Detective Kang!

523
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:22,403
He's a rookie,
so he doesn't know what to do.

524
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:23,774
Get out of here.

525
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:26,075
Oh, I am sorry, sir.

526
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:29,486
What a cocky shit!

527
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,887
Sorry for making such a fuss here.

528
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,702
I will keep you updated, sir.

529
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,475
What are you doing here?

530
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,089
What are you doing?

531
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:08,282
I know you know it.

532
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,689
From now on
you better watch your mouth!

533
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,796
I don't like shitty lies.

534
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,795
Yu-ri knew we were coming.

535
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,002
What did you meet Prosecutor Park for?

536
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:21,502
What kind of underhanded shit
did you talk about?

537
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,800
- Don't groundlessly get suspicious of me.
- Being suspicious of everyone is what I do.

538
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,706
You work for
the interior affairs, right?

539
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:32,181
I got my information line.
I've been a cop for 30 years.

540
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,879
Do you know what the worst part
in being a cop is?

541
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,079
We're likely to
see the evil side of a person.

542
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,587
Then show me your good side,
if you have one.

543
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:43,181
Look at you;
you are suspicious of Park!

544
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,194
But being closer to them is

545
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,298
the key to getting information.

546
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:51,596
- Oh, you don't know ABC about "internal affairs"!
- Don't make up shitty excuses,

547
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,703
I know you bastard
more than any one else!

548
00:42:54,638 --> 00:42:57,505
What? Bastard?

549
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:00,001
You crossed the line!

550
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:07,484
Okay, if you think I did
something shitty, cuff me!

551
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:12,380
Here, just do whatever you want!

552
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:17,687
Hey, what are you doing?

553
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:22,490
No, give that back to me,
don't touch it!

554
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:28,105
What a shame!

555
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,373
Dear my love, Gyu-hwa...

556
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,568
Whenever I see your bright eyes,
you're my angel from heaven.

557
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:34,711
You better watch out yourself.

558
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,876
When it comes to work,
there's no limit!

559
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:54,591
Here are the files on the
drug related stuff you requested.

560
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,997
But there are a lot
not officially reported. So...

561
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,501
Oh, it would take days to
look though all of these.

562
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,900
There's more over there.

563
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,609
Busan is the biggest port,
so drug crimes are very common.

564
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:08,001
Thanks anyway.

565
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:09,612
No problem. What's this?

566
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,573
Go home;
your family must be waiting.

567
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:15,480
But you are still here,

568
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:17,177
how can I go home before you?

569
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:23,287
But my daughters need me, badly!

570
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:27,488
What a dilemma, being a good father
makes it hard to be a good cop.

571
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,999
Oh, you are
good enough as a cop, so...

572
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,200
Sorry, but,

573
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,397
what I got in mind is to be
a good father rather than a good cop.

574
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,508
So, may I go now?

575
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:46,075
"Middle School English"
Oh, "of course".

576
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:50,175
"That's all right."
All night...

577
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:54,085
Oh, look at you, Detective Kang.

578
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:56,488
"Welcome to my... brother."

579
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:59,987
The Boss is taking a nap,
shall I tell him you're here?

580
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,189
- No, thanks.
- Then how about some noodles?

581
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,698
I know a great recipe for noodle soup!

582
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:08,999
No, some coffee would be great.

583
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,801
Coffee, of course!

584
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:32,989
Oh, you are here, Young-jun!

585
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:36,797
Oh, you are here, perfect timing!

586
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,594
Let's go.

587
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:53,180
So, someone tipped you off
that she's here?

588
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,376
Oh, as a cop,
we have something better, instinct!

589
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,977
You saw at her house,
she is a huge fan of Lotte.

590
00:45:59,123 --> 00:46:02,092
Today, there's a big game,
and no doubt she'll be here.

591
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:04,990
So, what numbers are important,
did I tell you?

592
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:07,287
Two and six!

593
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,189
Your work has no principles or rules,
is that how you work?

594
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,096
No rules or principles?

595
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,302
But this is what it takes to get
what we want.

596
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,105
It's a hunch!
Do you believe it?

597
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:22,703
No.

598
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,582
It's too bad, my hunch says...

599
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:29,081
Lotte wins today.

600
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:43,399
- Hey, Young-cheol.
- Yes, Boss.

601
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,900
- Go get some beer and snacks.
- No problem, boss.

602
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:49,904
I will be back in a minute,
fighting Lotte!

603
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,401
My hunch says today we've come to nothing.
Let's watch the game!

604
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:56,872
Don't you like baseball?

605
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,778
I don't like
'wasting time without discretion'.

606
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:04,183
- You are for Lotte, right?
- No, I'm for Doosan.

607
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,789
Oh my, you move yourself
over there to the third base area!

608
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:12,089
If you root for Doosan here,
you could get killed.

609
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,495
Enough!

610
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:20,699
Oh, Detective Kang, where are you going?
Let's have fun.

611
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,305
Oh damn.

612
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,498
Here I come, what happened, Boss?
Who's winning?
