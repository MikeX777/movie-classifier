1
00:01:01,377 --> 00:01:02,969
Aces.

2
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:07,983
Fine.

3
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,613
Come on, ace. Ah.

4
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:23,929
Thank goodness for that. I'm done.

5
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:26,330
Come on, Joe, double or nothing.

6
00:01:26,603 --> 00:01:30,733
Oh, heh. Not me, Nick.
I've paid you double too many times.

7
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:34,365
Well, faint heart never won fair lady,
or fat turkey.

8
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,335
Come on, Joe, what do you say?
Heads or tails?

9
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,449
Uh... I say tails.

10
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:44,518
I never seen such a lucky stiff.

11
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,212
Better luck next time, Joe.

12
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:52,119
Well, I guess we got enough money
to close up now.

13
00:01:58,301 --> 00:02:00,132
Say, is that my tie?

14
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:01,702
Why...

15
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,771
When I got up this morning, I sort of...

16
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,068
Yeah, well, why didn't you put on
that new checkered suit of mine...

17
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:08,870
...while you were about it?
- Heh-heh-heh.

18
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,307
It didn't fit.

19
00:02:12,282 --> 00:02:13,579
- Hey, Nick.
- Yeah?

20
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,877
Who do you like in the last race
at Louisville?

21
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,179
Well, I got my dough on Abie Kabbible.

22
00:02:18,354 --> 00:02:20,549
- You think he'll win?
- Why, sure he'll win.

23
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,452
Nothing else, he'll win by a nose.

24
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:26,994
- Smart fella, this boy.
- I'm looking for action tonight myself.

25
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:30,621
- Well, don't worry, boy, you'll get it.
Everything all right?

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,258
Mr. Nick, there's a lady outside
what wants to see you.

27
00:02:34,437 --> 00:02:36,405
How do you know she's a lady,
Snake Eyes?

28
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:39,971
Heh. Well, boss, she's got a skirt on.

29
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:45,914
- All right, I'll see her.
- Don't forget to remember, boss.

30
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,550
Lucky with the cards, unlucky with the love.

31
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:50,310
That's a lot of bunkaroo.

32
00:02:50,486 --> 00:02:52,545
Don't you forget to remember...

33
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:55,486
- Little Nick is lucky with the women too.
I don't know.

34
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:58,786
- Sometime, you'll pick the wrong filly.
- Not a chance.

35
00:02:58,962 --> 00:03:01,726
Nothing but favorites in my stable.

36
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:04,992
My lady, here I come.

37
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:12,866
- Oh, hello, baby.
- Hello, Nick.

38
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:14,100
What's the matter?

39
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,541
I've got to have some money
right away, Nick.

40
00:03:16,713 --> 00:03:18,442
Well, what's up?

41
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,539
Hmm?

42
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:26,448
Yeah?

43
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:30,023
Hmm.

44
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,489
- How much do you need?
- I've got to have a hundred dollars.

45
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:37,795
Well, you know Nick.

46
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,697
I never go back on my word, sister.

47
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:50,473
Thank you, Nick. I wouldn't have asked you
for it if I didn't have to have it.

48
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,444
Sure, I know. I know you wouldn't.

49
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:56,381
- Gee, you're a swell fellow.
- Well, I'm glad to do it, baby. Glad to do it.

50
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,081
I've gotta be going now, Nick.

51
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,684
- Bye.
- So long.

52
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:08,796
Hmm.

53
00:04:17,307 --> 00:04:20,242
Oh, back so soon, eh? Well?

54
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,743
- What's the matter?
- A dame wanting me to step out with her.

55
00:04:23,913 --> 00:04:26,404
I've got holes in my socks
from kicking skirts away.

56
00:04:26,582 --> 00:04:29,278
Let's see what the boys
in the backroom have got to offer.

57
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:31,215
I'll be right in.

58
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,794
Uh... Running into house and lot.

59
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,904
Who'll give me half a dollar for my hand?

60
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:50,972
I wouldn't give you a nickel
for your whole body.

61
00:04:52,308 --> 00:04:54,367
Oh, Mr. Nick.

62
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,638
- Let's see you do it.
- Come, dice. Hah!

63
00:04:57,814 --> 00:04:59,145
Eight's the point.

64
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:00,577
A dollar I comes, Mr. Nick.

65
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,945
Bet. Bet it is.

66
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,211
Half a cigar, he shoots.

67
00:05:07,957 --> 00:05:10,790
- Hah!
- Six and he wants eight.

68
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,794
- Eight from Decatur. Hah.
Ha-ha.

69
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:21,228
Read them and weep.
Seven and you're through.

70
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:24,339
- Up pops the devil.
Ha-ha-ha.

71
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:26,202
Tough luck.

72
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:27,638
- Mr. Nick.
- Yeah?

73
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,677
You sure is one lucky white man.

74
00:05:30,847 --> 00:05:32,371
You got carfare home, Snake Eyes?

75
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:35,449
No, sir, I ain't, boss.
I ain't got a red cent.

76
00:05:35,618 --> 00:05:39,054
Then here, take this fin.
Stay out of this game from now on.

77
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:40,951
Yes, sir.

78
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:43,592
Don't you kid yourself.
He had you on the run...

79
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,990
- Come on, come on, who shoots next?
- Your dice.

80
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:47,424
Come on, your dice, man.

81
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,566
All right, get your money ready, Nick.
- Hey, let me in here.

82
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:56,262
Hey, what are you doing,
kibitzing the game?

83
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,067
No, I got dough.

84
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:01,767
Well, we're not taking
any two-bit bets tonight, Sport.

85
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:06,278
Well, I'm not making
any two-bit bets tonight.

86
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:10,447
Whew.
- That look like two bits to you?

87
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:14,550
This is big-time.

88
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:18,558
Hmm.

89
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,829
- All right.
- I'll shoot 10 of that.

90
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:25,331
- Shoot all or nothing.
- What are you talking about?

91
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:28,129
- You'll shoot the C-note or nothing.
- You can't tell me...

92
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,738
You heard me, the hundred or nothing.

93
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,901
Shoot the piece.

94
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,343
This is big game now.

95
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:42,917
- Get up and leave. The dough is piling up.
- Come on.

96
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,747
Three and two. Point is five.

97
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:50,517
- Six, and he wants five.
- Uh-oh.

98
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:52,861
Go on.

99
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:55,896
- Seven, makes him a loser.
- Heh.

100
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,160
And the prisoner ate a hearty breakfast.

101
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:03,669
- Well, that cleans me.
- Well, come on, move along.

102
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,239
- What the...?
- Come on, breeze.

103
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:08,673
And as you go out that door,
take that "welcome" sign off it.

104
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,186
Hey, boss, what do you got
against this Sport?

105
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:23,484
- I don't like the way he parts his hair.
Ha-ha-ha.

106
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:25,627
- Who shoots next?
- You're too tough for me.

107
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:27,786
- It's not for us.
- I don't want any.

108
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:31,092
Nick, you're wasting your time
in a small tank like this.

109
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:33,735
You should be in that big game
in the city.

110
00:07:33,903 --> 00:07:36,633
Why, Hickory Short
would be a cinch for you.

111
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:39,604
- You ain't kidding me, are you?
- I'm on the level.

112
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,606
Yes.

113
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:44,841
This town's getting soft for me.

114
00:07:45,014 --> 00:07:46,948
How much would it take
to buck that game?

115
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:51,712
Well, a fella shouldn't try to
unless he had at least $ 10,000.

116
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,583
Whew.
That's a lot of dough.

117
00:07:53,756 --> 00:07:55,815
Ooh.
- Ten thousand bucks.

118
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:57,758
I'll have that someday.

119
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:00,987
And when I do,
I'll show those city birds something.

120
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:05,567
Say, listen, why don't we make up a pool
and stake Nick to that big game?

121
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,101
- I'll go for a little of it.
- You mean that, kid?

122
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:10,262
Sure, you can have all I got.

123
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,202
That's a great idea.

124
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,275
I could raise 5000 on the barbershop.

125
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:17,844
I put in $ 1000, what I was gonna
send back for my wife to bring her here.

126
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:19,982
Oh, no, no, no, don't do that. Ha-ha.

127
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:24,085
Well, look, maybe I'm better off if I don't
send it so I can't lose nothing anyhow.

128
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,321
I'll put in a hundred.
Count me in.

129
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,720
I'll put in 200.
You can have all I've got.

130
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:32,224
I'll back you anytime.
We're all with you.

131
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:34,022
Right.

132
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:42,130
Blondie, what do say about us two
going to the big city, huh?

133
00:08:47,977 --> 00:08:49,205
Boys, you're on.

134
00:08:49,378 --> 00:08:51,437
Attaboy, Nicky,
you'll knock them for a loop.

135
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:58,185
- Here, Mr. Nick, I'll put in $5.
- Oh, no...

136
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,559
Oh.
We can't lose now.

137
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,432
Too much from a guy now, will you?
- Not too.

138
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,364
- Goodbye.
- Bye, write me a letter and get fat, will you?

139
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:14,935
Okay.

140
00:09:15,104 --> 00:09:18,699
Just keep that in your pocket, Mr. Nick,
and you'll win for sure.

141
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:20,569
Oh, thanks, Snake Eyes.

142
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:24,042
Say, I've practically got that big city sugar
in my kick right now.

143
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:25,373
Come here, give me luck.

144
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,046
Here, Nick, here's my home
office address.

145
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:31,709
You can send my share there.

146
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:34,253
- I'll send you back your grand and your cut.
Okay.

147
00:09:34,423 --> 00:09:38,689
You all understand, I pay back your original
investment and we split the winnings 50-50.

148
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:40,556
That's right.

149
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,425
How much you think you're gonna win?

150
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:45,362
I'll win so much,
you can send back to the old country...

151
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:47,263
...for your wife and your sweetheart too.

152
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:52,533
Well, now, look here, young squirt,
you keep that barbershop going.

153
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,936
Sorry to see you go, Nick.

154
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,671
Well, soon as I make my killing,
I'll send for you, and that won't be long.

155
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,474
- Here's your ride.
- I'll be waiting.

156
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:01,708
- Well.
- Good luck with those big-city blonds.

157
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:05,011
Yeah, well, this is the only blond
that I'm true to.

158
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:11,025
Goodbye.

159
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,492
Say, conductor,
what time do we get to the big city?

160
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:18,600
We're due in there at 6:42.
And we've never been late yet.

161
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:21,293
Well, I bet you 10-to-5 we don't make it.

162
00:10:31,747 --> 00:10:34,215
Nice ride. Thanks.

163
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,117
Telegram for Mr. L.S. Johnson.

164
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,922
Mr. L.S. Johnson, please.

165
00:10:48,264 --> 00:10:50,732
Telegram for Mr. L.S. Johnson.

166
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:55,367
Good morning.
- Good morning.

167
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:58,302
- Everything satisfactory, Mr. Venizelos?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

168
00:10:58,474 --> 00:11:01,102
Fine hotel you got here.
Where's the barbershop?

169
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:03,802
- It's right downstairs, sir.
- Oh, thanks.

170
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:07,881
Oh, by the way, you haven't seen
Hickory Short around here today, have you?

171
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,280
You mean Hickory Short, the gambler?

172
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:13,251
- Yeah.
- He doesn't live here.

173
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,787
I heard he hung out here.

174
00:11:14,957 --> 00:11:16,481
Well, not in this hotel.

175
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:18,126
Hmm.

176
00:11:19,628 --> 00:11:23,587
Say, you don't happen to know
in which room the big roving poker game...

177
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,233
...is going on tonight, do you?

178
00:11:25,401 --> 00:11:28,734
No, sir, I don't. We don't permit anything
like that around this hotel.

179
00:11:28,904 --> 00:11:31,338
Oh, I see.

180
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,265
Thanks. Heh-heh.

181
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:40,881
Huh.

182
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,124
Whew.

183
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:58,264
Hmm.

184
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:09,400
Heh.

185
00:12:23,058 --> 00:12:24,821
Oh, uh...

186
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,019
I'd like a heater, miss.

187
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:29,921
- Heater?
- Yeah, a cigar.

188
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,360
I've never heard them called that before.
Any particular brand?

189
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:38,371
Oh, about two bits or better,
if you got them.

190
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,406
These are very nice.
I can recommend them.

191
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:46,878
You smoke them yourself?

192
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:48,038
Oh, no, sir.

193
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:52,110
Well, they are good. Hmm.

194
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:54,620
Look awfully good.
I'll take four or five of these.

195
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,054
- How much are they?
- They're a dollar apiece.

196
00:12:57,827 --> 00:12:59,351
You think so?

197
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,996
Well, that's the price.

198
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,389
All right. Ahem.

199
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:08,202
I'll take them.

200
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,304
Here you are, lady.

201
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:13,207
- Thank you.
- Keep the change.

202
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:18,872
Say, what are these things for?

203
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,276
Poker dice.

204
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:22,041
Oh, you gamble with them?

205
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,083
Yes, sir, it's a dollar if you lose.

206
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:26,380
If you win,
you get $2 worth of merchandise.

207
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,455
Anything behind the counter?

208
00:13:29,024 --> 00:13:30,685
Anything in merchandise.

209
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,987
Heh-heh.
Well, you're a cute little package.

210
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,397
Would you like to roll the dice?

211
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:40,759
Well, I don't know.
I'm a little green at this sort of thing.

212
00:13:43,105 --> 00:13:44,333
Poker dice, one flop.

213
00:13:44,507 --> 00:13:46,998
- All right.
- Here goes.

214
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,435
- Hard to beat, lady. Heh-heh-heh.
- Not for me.

215
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:52,808
- Well, come on, let's see you do it.
- Here goes.

216
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:54,415
I'm for you. There you go.

217
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,948
Two fours.

218
00:13:56,118 --> 00:13:58,279
- Three fours, one on me.
- Ha-ha-ha.

219
00:13:58,454 --> 00:14:00,422
Well, here goes again.

220
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,147
Make it easy for you this time.

221
00:14:02,324 --> 00:14:04,815
Pair of fives. That's a cinch.

222
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:07,861
- I'd beat it with my eyes closed.
- I bet you can too.

223
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,260
- Come on, let's see you do it. Ha-ha-ha.
- Here goes.

224
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,228
Oh, two fours.

225
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:14,198
- Well, I'm sorry. Sorry, lady.
- Two on me.

226
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,769
Ha-ha.

227
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:18,838
Say, you're a cute little trick.
Anybody ever tell you that?

228
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:20,198
Not yet.

229
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:22,108
Oh.

230
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:24,805
Well, here goes again.

231
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,915
Well, better still, straight six high.

232
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,051
- Beat that.
- You must have beginner's luck.

233
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:34,087
- But I'll beat it even yet.
- Come on, let's see you do it. Come on.

234
00:14:34,256 --> 00:14:37,089
- There's a straight.
- I'm sorry, baby, but you lose.

235
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:39,420
Five high, mine was six high.

236
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:42,792
Say, look here. You better quit this.

237
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,729
I hate to see a nice little girl like you
lose her job.

238
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:48,961
Thanks.
That's three games on the house.

239
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,073
My, but you're lucky.
Do you gamble much?

240
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:56,302
Oh, I take a little flyer
every once in a while.

241
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,105
For big money?

242
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,508
Do I look like a tinhorn?

243
00:15:00,282 --> 00:15:02,045
- I should say not.
- Heh-heh-heh.

244
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:03,741
Well, how much do I owe you?

245
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:06,513
Three dollars,
and you get $6 worth of merchandise.

246
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:08,486
What will you have?

247
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,558
I got my eye on that big box
of candy right there.

248
00:15:11,727 --> 00:15:14,821
- That's just $6.
- Well, I'll have it.

249
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:19,162
- Shall I wrap it up for you?
- No, no, no. You keep it, baby.

250
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,235
Oh, I don't think I can do that. I mean...

251
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:24,861
No, that's all right. I don't eat candy.
Gets in my teeth.

252
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:28,473
Well, that's too bad for you.

253
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:30,043
- Yeah.
- But my good luck.

254
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:32,547
Look here...

255
00:15:32,715 --> 00:15:35,115
You know, I'm a stranger in town.

256
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:38,515
How'd you like to come out
and have dinner with me tonight?

257
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:42,956
Oh, I couldn't. My mother
doesn't let me stay out at night.

258
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,786
Oh, that's too bad.

259
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:48,852
- Are you sure you won't change your mind?
- Oh, I couldn't. I really couldn't.

260
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:52,794
I'm glad you like it here.

261
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:55,163
It's very good, let me tell you that.

262
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:56,361
- Really?
- Yeah.

263
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,837
It's one of the best seafood places
I've ever been at. Ahem.

264
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:04,637
- I thought you'd like it.
- Great java too.

265
00:16:07,349 --> 00:16:08,907
Mmm.

266
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:12,314
Not a bad cigar you sold me.

267
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:16,615
I always say you can tell a gentleman
by the kind of cigar he smokes.

268
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,286
Of course, at home,
I smoke my own brand.

269
00:16:20,462 --> 00:16:22,953
- Yeah?
- A fellow in Havana makes them up for me.

270
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:25,191
- You don't say.
- Hmm.

271
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:33,099
Say, Marie, you know most of the regulars
that hang around the hotel, don't you?

272
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:36,301
Well, yes. Why?

273
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:40,812
Well, ever see Hickory Short around?
You know, the big gambler.

274
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:43,781
Well, he's an awfully nice fellow.
He's around all the time.

275
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:47,186
You don't happen to know which room
they're holding the game?

276
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:49,324
I happen to know.
You won't say I told you.

277
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:51,220
Not a word. Come on, tell me, sister.

278
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:54,692
Mr. Short ordered some cigars
to be sent up to his room this afternoon.

279
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:57,798
- Yeah?
- And it's 346.

280
00:16:57,966 --> 00:17:00,628
Boy, am I itching to get in that game.

281
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:02,464
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

282
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:05,072
I hope you don't think I'm butting in,
Mr. Venizelos.

283
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,867
Call me Nick.

284
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,532
All right, Nick.

285
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:12,078
Attagirl. Heh-heh. Say,
we getting along swell, aren't we? Heh.

286
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:16,650
- What is it you're gonna say, baby?
- You've been so nice to me and all.

287
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:20,050
I was just going to suggest
that you put some money in the hotel safe.

288
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:22,816
- Yeah?
- For carfare home, in case you...

289
00:17:22,991 --> 00:17:25,551
There won't be any in case, sister.

290
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:27,560
I hope not.

291
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,827
All right, I got an idea.

292
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,634
Here.

293
00:17:34,403 --> 00:17:35,665
Now, you keep this for me.

294
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:37,806
- A hundred dollars? Why, I couldn't.
- Yeah.

295
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,907
You keep this for me, baby.

296
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:44,239
After the game, I'll make you a present
of it. And if I lose... Heh.

297
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:47,314
Gee, it sounds funny to hear myself
saying "lose. "

298
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,475
Well, if I should lose,
I'll need it for cigar money.

299
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,748
But you don't know me,
I might run away with it.

300
00:17:53,922 --> 00:17:56,550
Now, listen, sister, I'm a gambler.

301
00:17:56,725 --> 00:18:00,491
It's my business to read human nature,
to know people.

302
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:04,496
- And I can tell that you're on the level.
- But you could put it in the hotel safe.

303
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,432
Oh, no. You're safe enough for me, baby.

304
00:18:08,604 --> 00:18:10,868
Well, all right, if you insist.

305
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,372
Attagirl. Come on, put it in the sock.
Heh-heh.

306
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:49,566
Uh...

307
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:51,372
I'd like to see Hickory Short.

308
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,447
Well, I'm Hickory Short.

309
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:55,276
Yeah?

310
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:59,185
Well, I'm Nick Venizelos from Irontown.

311
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:01,618
- Nick the Barber, they call me.
- Oh.

312
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,350
- Come in, Mr. Venizelos.
- Thanks.

313
00:19:04,526 --> 00:19:06,494
I've often heard of you.

314
00:19:06,662 --> 00:19:08,186
Yeah? Heh-heh.

315
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:09,830
Well...

316
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:12,091
Have you any way
of identifying yourself?

317
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:14,030
Why, yes, I...

318
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:16,467
Gee, I forgot my badge.

319
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:18,105
Yeah.

320
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:20,097
Here.

321
00:19:20,275 --> 00:19:23,142
- Mm-hm. Yeah.
- "Nick Venizelos. "

322
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,244
- Well?
- You didn't miss many of them, did you?

323
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,442
Well, here's the convincer.

324
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:32,917
- That's me in the middle.
- Hmm.

325
00:19:33,522 --> 00:19:36,286
Well, I guess you're yourself, all right.

326
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:40,554
I'm glad to meet you after all the stories
I've heard about your luck, Mr. Venizelos.

327
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:43,061
- Oh, call me Nick.
- Hmm.

328
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:46,201
- All right, Nick.
- Attaboy, Hick. Heh.

329
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:49,360
You know, I've been wanting
to meet you for a long time.

330
00:19:49,538 --> 00:19:52,302
- For a little action? Heh-heh.
- How'd you guess?

331
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:54,738
Come on over.
I want you to meet some of the boys.

332
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,434
- Sure.
- King's high.

333
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,944
Boys, I want you to meet Mr. Venizelos.
Ahem.

334
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,173
- Mr. Tompkins.
- Honest John Tompkins?

335
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,784
- That's me.
- Oh, glad to know you, John.

336
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:06,716
- Mr. River.
- Old Deep River himself, eh?

337
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:09,881
In person. Not a motion picture, Nick.
Heh-heh-heh.

338
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:12,891
- Mr. Shultz.
- Back-to-Back Shultz.

339
00:20:13,061 --> 00:20:15,757
You're the fella that almost
broke the bank at Monte Carlo.

340
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:19,332
- Guilty. Glad to know you, Nick.
- Well, I'm glad to know you, Shultz.

341
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:21,435
And Mr. Barnes.

342
00:20:21,603 --> 00:20:24,470
- I don't like them from the bottom, brother.
- All right, Nick.

343
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,471
I'll make an exception in your case.

344
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,200
- Hello.
- Have some grape, Nick?

345
00:20:28,377 --> 00:20:31,744
Well, thanks, I don't much
mind if I do. Yeah.

346
00:20:32,781 --> 00:20:34,271
Hmm.

347
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:38,611
Ahhh. Mm-hm.

348
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:40,687
Fizz water, huh? Heh-heh.

349
00:20:40,856 --> 00:20:43,848
Very good, Hickory. Where'd you get it?
I'd like to get a case.

350
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:45,755
I'll send you around a case tomorrow.

351
00:20:45,928 --> 00:20:48,522
Well, maybe I'll be better able
to pay for it tomorrow.

352
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,631
- Well, I'll send it to you anyhow.
- Hmm.

353
00:20:54,803 --> 00:20:57,465
Well, what are we waiting for?

354
00:20:57,639 --> 00:20:59,971
How about a little game
of skill and chance?

355
00:21:00,142 --> 00:21:02,042
Well, I've heard of such things.

356
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,438
What do you like to play?

357
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:05,739
Five-card stud. How does that suit you?

358
00:21:05,914 --> 00:21:07,939
- What's the limit?
- The roof.

359
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:09,242
Fine.

360
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:11,045
Now, Nick, we're all friends here.

361
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:14,711
Of course, we ain't playing marbles,
but we don't want no arguments.

362
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,484
- Anything ain't right, you just say so.
- Right.

363
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:20,219
- Waiter?
Yes, sir.

364
00:21:20,395 --> 00:21:24,729
Bring a half a dozen new decks of cards.
Regular backs. Hmm?

365
00:21:28,103 --> 00:21:29,900
- Oh.
- Well, go on, stupid.

366
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:31,630
- Anything the guest wants.
- Heh-heh-heh.

367
00:21:31,807 --> 00:21:33,297
Yes, sir.

368
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:37,370
- What's the matter? Ain't those cards good?
- Oh, sure.

369
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,810
Just an old barbershop custom.

370
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:42,644
A fresh towel with every shave
is my motto.

371
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:45,378
Here, give me 5 G.

372
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,419
All right, Nick.

373
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,148
Four there?

374
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:52,054
If you run out of those,
there's more where they come from.

375
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,628
Brother, before the night's over,
you'll be buying them from me.

376
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,434
- Well, you're an optimist anyhow.
- That's the way to be, Nick.

377
00:22:01,603 --> 00:22:03,366
Say, what are these yellows?
Thousands?

378
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:04,766
- Yes.
- What are the blues?

379
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,840
Blues are hundreds.

380
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:08,806
I'll call.

381
00:22:08,977 --> 00:22:11,502
- All right, boys?
- Come on, ace me, big boy.

382
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,342
Well, a pair of aces.
Looks like you made them, Nick.

383
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:15,847
A seven.

384
00:22:16,018 --> 00:22:18,179
- I didn't do too well.
Six is a pair.

385
00:22:18,353 --> 00:22:20,787
And a little deuce, a pair of aces.
Bet they're high.

386
00:22:20,956 --> 00:22:23,015
Well, that cleans me out, boys.

387
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:25,250
Looks like I'm on my way
to the cleaners too.

388
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,895
- Never say die.
- I'll call.

389
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:30,327
- Raise you.
- I'm out.

390
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:34,458
Well, that'll have to be a side bet.

391
00:22:37,506 --> 00:22:40,669
Well, I'll call. Pair of aces with a queen.

392
00:22:40,842 --> 00:22:43,504
I think I got you, Hickory.
Aces, king next.

393
00:22:43,678 --> 00:22:45,669
- Yes, you're right.
- Thanks, gentlemen.

394
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:48,042
- Jacks and sixes.
- Whew.

395
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:50,783
- What a pot.
- Old Back-to-Back Shultz.

396
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:52,809
Ah.

397
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:56,257
Well, Nick, the luck's certainly
running against you tonight.

398
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:59,690
Yeah. Oh, it's just a matter
of the breaks. Heh-heh.

399
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:01,795
Don't worry about me, boys.

400
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,453
My brother works in the mint.

401
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:32,388
- Good morning, Mr. Venizelos.
- Good morning.

402
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:48,706
"Knocked them dead. " Hmm.

403
00:23:53,381 --> 00:23:54,814
Hey, what's that?

404
00:23:54,983 --> 00:23:57,451
I don't know, but it's plenty heavy.

405
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:11,391
- Hmm.
- Is that all, sir?

406
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:13,761
Yeah, that's all.

407
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,541
Here, take that.

408
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,410
Gee, thank you.

409
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:30,517
Thank you ever so much.

410
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:53,638
Say, girlie, where's Marie?

411
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:55,901
Marie? Oh, you mean the girl
that worked here?

412
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,874
- Yeah.
- I don't know, sir.

413
00:24:58,046 --> 00:25:00,207
I just got a call
to report here this morning.

414
00:25:00,382 --> 00:25:01,849
Oh.

415
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:03,678
I see.

416
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:11,491
Hmm.

417
00:25:19,701 --> 00:25:21,828
You don't mind if I put my hat
on top of yours?

418
00:25:22,003 --> 00:25:24,471
- It's all right, sir.
- All right.

419
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,595
What's the idea, young man?

420
00:25:48,263 --> 00:25:50,527
Give me my paper back. Oh.

421
00:25:50,899 --> 00:25:53,925
I like your nerve, you...

422
00:26:04,946 --> 00:26:07,244
Well, well, if it isn't Nick.

423
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:08,643
Well, it ain't his sister.

424
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,313
I'm awfully glad to see you.

425
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,853
I didn't think you'd get out
of that other game.

426
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:17,651
Hickory, that was nice of you
to send me that fizz water.

427
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,418
Don't mention it. Pleasure's mine.

428
00:26:19,594 --> 00:26:20,856
- How are you?
- Hello, Nick.

429
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:22,587
- Hi, pal.
- Glad to see you.

430
00:26:22,764 --> 00:26:24,994
You locate some fresh money, Nick?
Heh-heh.

431
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,259
Well, I told you,
my brother works in the mint.

432
00:26:29,537 --> 00:26:32,529
You know, it ain't so tough
when you got friends.

433
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:35,642
Come on, sit in, Nick.
You can't get even standing up.

434
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,641
I'm glad you got out of that other game.

435
00:26:37,812 --> 00:26:38,870
You'd be better company.

436
00:26:39,047 --> 00:26:41,982
Sit in, Nick, the water's fine.
They're taking me tonight.

437
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,243
Well, do you think
you can afford it, big boy?

438
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:45,408
Can he afford it?

439
00:26:47,222 --> 00:26:49,622
Oh, you ain't got any chips yet, Nick.

440
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:51,190
- I'll take 3000.
Right.

441
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,690
No use holding up the deal.

442
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,295
That's all right, plenty of time.
Don't be in a hurry.

443
00:26:55,463 --> 00:26:58,227
There they are, Nick,
the same values as yesterday.

444
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,731
- Mm.
- King bets 50.

445
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:01,766
Come again, Shultzy, 50 more.

446
00:27:01,936 --> 00:27:03,267
Call.

447
00:27:03,438 --> 00:27:05,429
You're too tough for me, boys.
Fight it out.

448
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:07,575
- I scram.
- And 50 more to you.

449
00:27:07,742 --> 00:27:09,903
- I stay.
- Call.

450
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:11,836
Coming up.

451
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:14,311
King, six, nine, the eight.

452
00:27:14,482 --> 00:27:17,076
- The king, six is high. You bet, Shultz.
Check.

453
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:19,584
Well, you can't have anything in check.
Heh-heh.

454
00:27:19,754 --> 00:27:21,551
I bet a blue.

455
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,123
- I'll call it.
Make it three.

456
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:26,522
All right, I'll stay.

457
00:27:26,695 --> 00:27:28,322
Stay.

458
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:30,487
Coming up, you caught a five.

459
00:27:30,665 --> 00:27:33,225
You caught the ace,
you caught the other ace.

460
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,959
Ace, jack is high. Your bet.

461
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:37,104
Well, I'll check to the raise.

462
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:38,899
Bet a half a yellow.

463
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,168
Well, how about making it a full yellow,
just for good luck, eh?

464
00:27:42,344 --> 00:27:44,904
- That's okay.
- I'll see it.

465
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,308
Call.

466
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:48,745
Here's the card that tells the story.

467
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,851
You caught a nine.

468
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:54,182
The ace, king, the 10.
The ace, king is high. Your bet, Nick.

469
00:27:54,356 --> 00:27:57,086
Well, ace, king bets five blues.

470
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:00,421
- Well, I'll make it a yellow.
- Call.

471
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:06,061
Well, I got so much confidence in my hand,
I'll tap myself for a yellow and red.

472
00:28:06,234 --> 00:28:08,634
All right, I'll call it.

473
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:11,600
- Shultz is calling.
- Call.

474
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,297
Kings are good, I guess.

475
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:16,137
Not with me. Pair of aces.

476
00:28:16,311 --> 00:28:17,903
Well, I think I top you, Hickory.

477
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,410
Aces, king next.

478
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:23,347
You win. Looks like your lucky day.
- Whew. Oh, boy.

479
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:26,545
That's the works. Sweet pot.

480
00:28:26,721 --> 00:28:29,417
This Nick the Barber's
just a gambling fool.

481
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:31,183
And here you are, Barnes.

482
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:34,453
Here's my 3000 back. I'll play these.

483
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:37,928
You keep these, Nick.
Keep them, pay for them.

484
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:41,000
You ain't got enough velvet
to see yourself through a bad hand.

485
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:44,468
- That's all right. If I need them, I'll buy.
- Well, buy them now.

486
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,470
Well, why buy when I already got some?

487
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:49,041
See, I got enough here
to see me through a long way.

488
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,438
Well, that ain't the idea.

489
00:28:50,612 --> 00:28:53,274
You come here, sit in cold,
you sit in without any dough...

490
00:28:53,448 --> 00:28:56,906
- What do you mean without any dough?
- I know you got dough.

491
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:58,109
Well, what then?

492
00:28:58,286 --> 00:29:01,983
Well, it just ain't being done. You cash in
your chips when you're through.

493
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,091
Oh, what's the difference, Hickory?

494
00:29:04,259 --> 00:29:08,218
It's my game. It's gonna be played
according to house rules.

495
00:29:08,396 --> 00:29:09,988
All right, then.

496
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:13,157
Here, pay me off. I blew another game
to come up here tonight.

497
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,861
We ain't running any credit game.
You ain't in Irontown now.

498
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:19,836
- Let's see your dough.
- You saw my dough yesterday, 10 grand.

499
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,670
- Yeah? Well, yesterday was another day.
- Well, pay me off.

500
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,334
You trying to pull a fast one?

501
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,003
Who do you think you're playing with,
a lot of chumps?

502
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,707
- Come, show him your dough.
- I don't show you nothing.

503
00:29:29,884 --> 00:29:31,215
You cheap bunch of chiselers.

504
00:29:31,386 --> 00:29:33,286
I know who you are. Hickory Short, huh?

505
00:29:33,455 --> 00:29:35,548
Didn't take you long to get out
of that can.

506
00:29:35,723 --> 00:29:38,248
- How have you been, Sleepy Sam?
Ha-ha-ha.

507
00:29:38,426 --> 00:29:40,291
Yeah, and Two-Time Phil.

508
00:29:40,462 --> 00:29:43,522
- Well, what about it?
- You guys ain't gamblers. You're burglars.

509
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,030
How'd you like to show
your racket to the police?

510
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:49,967
Why, you smalltime squealer,
you tinhorn from the sticks...

511
00:29:50,138 --> 00:29:51,969
- Ah-ah-ah. Do I get my dough?
- You get nothing.

512
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,732
- Well, I'll show you.
Come here.

513
00:29:53,908 --> 00:29:54,932
Get back...

514
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:34,942
Well, hello, baby.

515
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,041
You must have the wrong apartment.

516
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:39,277
Why, you remember me.

517
00:30:39,454 --> 00:30:42,150
You remember, I gave you
that hundred bucks to keep for me.

518
00:30:42,323 --> 00:30:43,654
I never saw you before.

519
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,090
Say, what is this?

520
00:30:46,561 --> 00:30:48,825
It's the big city, Hiram.

521
00:30:48,997 --> 00:30:50,658
Scram.

522
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:56,660
Yah!

523
00:30:56,838 --> 00:30:58,135
Open that door.

524
00:30:58,306 --> 00:31:01,366
I thought so.
Why, you're a shelf for those burglars.

525
00:31:01,543 --> 00:31:04,239
Stole the money
that belonged to my friends.

526
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:06,937
Come on, open that door.

527
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:11,643
All right. If that's the way you play the
game in this town, I'll play it the same way.

528
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:14,583
Only I'll play it in spades.
That means you'll pay double.

529
00:31:14,756 --> 00:31:16,747
Why, you hustling little bag.

530
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:18,893
I'll have you begging for a cup of coffee.

531
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,723
And as for that dope of yours,
I'll run him right into the lake.

532
00:31:23,998 --> 00:31:26,364
What's the noise all about, monkey?

533
00:31:26,868 --> 00:31:29,132
- What's it to you?
- Nothing.

534
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,310
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, how are you, Mr. Amenoppopolus?

535
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,140
Step right in. Well...

536
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,682
- How about a shave today?
- Nice to see you. And you shall have it.

537
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:47,082
Well, nice to see you again.
I haven't seen you in some time now.

538
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:48,483
Where do you get your...?

539
00:31:50,925 --> 00:31:52,756
Oh, excuse me just a minute. Ahem.

540
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,636
Well, did you get the job, boy?

541
00:32:02,804 --> 00:32:05,602
Nope. Just missed out on it.

542
00:32:05,773 --> 00:32:07,570
Which makes it an even eight.

543
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:10,609
I told you not to come here
until I had dough to send for you.

544
00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:15,306
Yeah, I know, but I couldn't stand that
small burg any longer, Nick, after you left.

545
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:17,348
You know how it is.

546
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,919
Well, it'll be all right. You'll find a job.

547
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:22,920
- Had any lunch?
- Heh.

548
00:32:24,092 --> 00:32:26,060
Not today.

549
00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:31,659
Then here's 2 bucks.

550
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:36,566
Now, put this on Flying Feet
in that third race at Churchill Downs.

551
00:32:36,738 --> 00:32:40,538
And here's two bits for your lunch.
Now go on and put on the feed bag.

552
00:32:41,142 --> 00:32:42,769
Thanks, Nick.

553
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:51,051
Pardon me, Mr. Amenoppopolus,
but I had to speak to an old friend of mine.

554
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,813
- It's all right, Nick.
- Thanks.

555
00:32:53,988 --> 00:32:56,218
- Once over, same as usual?
- Yeah.

556
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,382
- All right.
- Don't shave it too close, Nick.

557
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,890
My face is very tender today.

558
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,892
I'll take care of that.

559
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,122
- Nice weather we're having.
- Mm-hm.

560
00:33:04,298 --> 00:33:05,731
Great for the races.

561
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,925
Yeah, I'm glad it isn't raining.

562
00:33:08,102 --> 00:33:10,093
The track is gliding fast, Nick.

563
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,676
Heh-heh. Oh, well, that doesn't make
any difference to me.

564
00:33:16,844 --> 00:33:20,644
Say, I can pick mudders just as easily
as fair weather horses anytime.

565
00:33:20,815 --> 00:33:23,249
- You little wizard. By the way...
- Yeah?

566
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,682
Who do you like
in the fifth race at Louisville?

567
00:33:25,853 --> 00:33:27,377
I got a little bet on No Regrets.

568
00:33:27,555 --> 00:33:30,080
Before I forget,
shoot this for me in the game tonight.

569
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,556
Right. Heh-heh-heh.

570
00:33:32,727 --> 00:33:34,058
How've you been doing lately?

571
00:33:34,228 --> 00:33:36,162
I've been doing swell,
Mr. Amenoppopolus.

572
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,026
The boys in the shop
have been staking me to the club game.

573
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,603
And I won quite a lot of jack for them,
and a little bit for myself.

574
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:45,602
They've been making a pool
for you, huh?

575
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,867
Yeah, that's the idea,
but that's just bush-league money.

576
00:33:49,043 --> 00:33:51,978
Oh, if I have
some really important dough...

577
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:54,546
...I could get into that big game
where the sugar is sweet.

578
00:33:55,883 --> 00:33:58,943
Why, how much would it take
to get into that big game?

579
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,020
Oh, about 10 grand.

580
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:04,249
- Ten thousand, huh?
- Yeah, 10,000, Mr. Amenoppopolus.

581
00:34:04,425 --> 00:34:06,484
And what I know now about the racket...

582
00:34:06,661 --> 00:34:08,891
...I could trim them plenty.
Heh-heh-heh.

583
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:18,600
I tell you, Peter,
he is the luckiest man in the world.

584
00:34:18,773 --> 00:34:21,674
- Ha-ha.
- How do you know it, Alex?

585
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:23,140
How do I know?

586
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,973
- I've been staking him in a small way.
- Yeah.

587
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,081
And he won for me every time.

588
00:34:28,249 --> 00:34:29,944
- Haven't I though, huh? Ha-ha-ha.
- Sure.

589
00:34:30,118 --> 00:34:34,953
Now, if we can put him in the big game,
I'm sure we can win big money.

590
00:34:35,123 --> 00:34:36,647
Boy. Ha-ha.

591
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:41,125
Well, I tell you, Alex, if it's good enough
for you, it's good enough for me...

592
00:34:41,295 --> 00:34:43,160
...for to take a chance.

593
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,391
- I'm not a gambling man, you know that.
- Yeah?

594
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:49,001
But you can count on me for 3000.

595
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,035
- Oh, boy.
- How's that?

596
00:34:51,205 --> 00:34:54,231
Oh, thanks, Pete.
You won't regret it, I tell you.

597
00:34:54,408 --> 00:34:56,603
My luck is running great these days.

598
00:34:56,778 --> 00:35:00,339
Fine. I'll get the cash and send it over.

599
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,415
- Thanks.
- Let's step across the street...

600
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:04,676
...and see Mr. Dondolos
and his four brothers.

601
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,376
They usually like a little sport.

602
00:35:06,554 --> 00:35:08,579
Yes, and let's not forget Mr. Agranopolis.

603
00:35:08,756 --> 00:35:10,621
- No. Sure.
- We mustn't hurt his feelings.

604
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:13,522
- Can't I put more money in?
- No, you've put in enough, boy.

605
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:14,922
You'll be getting plenty.

606
00:35:15,096 --> 00:35:17,997
You'll be backing up that truck of yours
at the bank every day.

607
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,134
- You watch it. That's great.
- Thanks, Pete.

608
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:22,201
- Goodbye, I appreciate it. Goodbye.
- Good luck.

609
00:35:33,815 --> 00:35:37,683
If you don't mind, I'd like to return these.
The boy brought me more than I needed.

610
00:35:37,852 --> 00:35:40,980
- All right, do you want the cash for them?
- Lf you please.

611
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,393
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

612
00:35:50,698 --> 00:35:52,529
Buy yourself a cigar.

613
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,361
Thank you.

614
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,815
Penthouse.

615
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:18,224
That was a nifty girl you had last night.

616
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:19,859
She wasn't bad, was she?

617
00:36:20,027 --> 00:36:21,426
I think she's not very good either.

618
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,628
Follow me.
You'll find I don't do so bad either.

619
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:27,632
You're a regular sheik, aren't you?
Not bad out here, boy.

620
00:36:27,802 --> 00:36:30,498
You think she had a sister?
I think it's the mustache.

621
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:33,435
What's wrong with this place?
Who is it?

622
00:36:34,575 --> 00:36:38,636
It's only me, Sam. Nick the Barber.

623
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,681
Well, Nick, hello, how are you?

624
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,909
Hello, hello.

625
00:36:45,086 --> 00:36:47,020
How are you, Nick?

626
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:53,059
- My name is Nick Venizelos, what's yours?
- Simpson, how are you?

627
00:36:53,227 --> 00:36:54,455
Glad to know you.

628
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,494
Well, I haven't seen you in six months.

629
00:36:56,931 --> 00:36:59,695
It's taken me that long
to catch up with you.

630
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:01,095
Go on, play your hand out.

631
00:37:01,269 --> 00:37:03,737
Oh, yeah.

632
00:37:03,905 --> 00:37:05,668
Will anybody open?

633
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,467
It's up to you, Sam.

634
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,907
Well, I can't do anything with these.

635
00:37:11,078 --> 00:37:13,171
- I pass.
It's by me.

636
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:15,042
You looking prosperous, Nick.

637
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,543
Hey, now listen, you mugs,
no use chicken-scratching around.

638
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:21,279
I got something to say to you,
especially to you.

639
00:37:21,455 --> 00:37:23,116
Sit down.

640
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:26,089
I've had some time to think things over.

641
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,854
I'm gonna be a real sucker.
I'm looking for evens.

642
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,725
You haven't any objections,
have you, Sam?

643
00:37:30,898 --> 00:37:33,890
No, no. Sure, I'll play with you, Nick.

644
00:37:34,268 --> 00:37:35,826
Good.

645
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,110
And you can see my dough this time.

646
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:47,270
Oh, you're all right with me, Nick.

647
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:50,748
I suppose I always was, huh?

648
00:37:51,652 --> 00:37:55,088
Now, listen, I got 50,000 bucks with me.
Fifty thousand.

649
00:37:55,256 --> 00:37:59,352
And I'll play you freeze out
for the whole amount, pay after each hand.

650
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,516
All right.

651
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,526
Whew. That's a lot of dough.

652
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:06,531
Not for Nick.
That brother of mine owns the mint now.

653
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,431
And I'll give you a break.
I'll play at your best game.

654
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:13,539
I'll play you poker, stud or draw,
Clobyosh, rummy, high or low...

655
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,699
...pinochle, I'll even cut your high cards.

656
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,811
Name your weapons. Here, suntan.

657
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:22,541
Go downstairs
and get a half a dozen new decks.

658
00:38:24,285 --> 00:38:25,513
- Yeah...
- Go on, stupid.

659
00:38:25,686 --> 00:38:27,278
Anything the guest wants.

660
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:28,922
Yes, sir.

661
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,058
You're still superstitious, huh?

662
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,954
No, just careful.

663
00:38:34,762 --> 00:38:37,128
Come on, Sam, get set.

664
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:40,228
Just you and me. We'll deal our own.

665
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,096
You boys get to the sidelines.

666
00:38:42,269 --> 00:38:44,260
You don't mind if I take a peek
of his play?

667
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:47,271
I don't care what you do.
I'm just playing Sam.

668
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:48,840
Count me in, Sam.

669
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:52,946
All right.
Save your chips and we'll cash in later.

670
00:38:57,985 --> 00:39:01,819
If you don't mind, let's see your dough.

671
00:39:02,523 --> 00:39:05,458
I think I can match you, all right.

672
00:39:09,163 --> 00:39:11,654
- Cards.
- Two.

673
00:39:13,134 --> 00:39:14,192
One for me.

674
00:39:16,971 --> 00:39:18,233
What do you do?

675
00:39:18,406 --> 00:39:21,569
Well, I can't bet in to a one-card draw.

676
00:39:23,544 --> 00:39:25,774
How much money have you got left?

677
00:39:27,348 --> 00:39:28,872
Five C's.

678
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:32,918
Well, you better put them in the center,
because that's just what I'm going to bet.

679
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:34,554
Five C's.

680
00:39:34,722 --> 00:39:36,883
Well, I've got to call you.

681
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:39,951
All blue.

682
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:43,221
Well, they're good, and I'm clean.

683
00:39:43,397 --> 00:39:45,058
I guess that's all. Hmm?

684
00:39:45,232 --> 00:39:47,826
It is, as far as I'm concerned.

685
00:39:49,003 --> 00:39:53,872
Sorry, Sleepy, tough luck.
Can't say that you got the breaks.

686
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:58,137
Gee, I wish those tailors
would make these pockets a little bigger.

687
00:39:59,413 --> 00:40:01,881
Well, Barnes,
and you had to cut in on his share.

688
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:03,311
Yeah.

689
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,679
Heh-heh. Not so smart, huh?

690
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,753
Yeah.

691
00:40:07,922 --> 00:40:11,722
Suntan, my hat, my cane, my gloves.

692
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,760
I heard that in a play once.

693
00:40:17,465 --> 00:40:18,762
Oh.

694
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,997
Here.

695
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:25,330
- Go with that as far as it'll take you.
- Thank you, sir.

696
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:33,603
Well, Nick the Barber
gave you a trimming, huh?

697
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,247
Well, I'll be seeing you, boys.

698
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,980
- Just a minute.
- Wait a minute, Nick.

699
00:40:42,156 --> 00:40:43,282
Behave.

700
00:40:44,892 --> 00:40:46,382
How do you like it, boys?

701
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:49,122
What are you singing the blues about?

702
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:53,596
I told you I was gonna get evens,
and I told you I was gonna play your way.

703
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:57,533
Of course, you smart gamblers
have heard of shaved cards.

704
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,936
Well, Nick the Barber can shave them
a little closer than you can.

705
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:04,673
Just take a look at those decks
I sent out for.

706
00:41:07,448 --> 00:41:10,940
Well, goodbye, boys.

707
00:41:11,118 --> 00:41:14,178
And thanks for the buggy ride.

708
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,150
A weak knee you turned out to be.

709
00:41:19,326 --> 00:41:22,318
- I had to take half of a dumb like that.
- Mug like that take you.

710
00:41:22,496 --> 00:41:25,727
- Pipe down, you. You make me sick.
What kind of a mug are you?

711
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:34,301
Say, the smoke bother you?

712
00:41:34,475 --> 00:41:36,773
- Oh, no, I like it.
- A little late to ask you, huh?

713
00:41:38,612 --> 00:41:40,876
You know, a fellow in Havana
makes them up for me.

714
00:41:41,048 --> 00:41:42,845
- You don't say.
- Yeah.

715
00:41:44,385 --> 00:41:47,320
Now, be yourself.

716
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:51,319
I suppose you're very happy this morning,
Mr. Venizelos.

717
00:41:51,492 --> 00:41:53,323
Yeah, why?

718
00:41:53,494 --> 00:41:58,124
I read in the papers about you
winning a lot of money from that gambler.

719
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:01,894
Um, Sleepy Sam,
I think that was his name.

720
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:04,537
Yeah. Oh, that was nothing.

721
00:42:04,705 --> 00:42:06,002
I'm just starting.

722
00:42:06,173 --> 00:42:08,698
Before long,
you'll be reading a whole lot about me.

723
00:42:10,711 --> 00:42:14,374
My, it must be wonderful
to win a lot of money like that.

724
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,584
Ooh. Money don't mean anything to me.

725
00:42:20,154 --> 00:42:23,419
Say, you're a pretty smart girl.

726
00:42:23,591 --> 00:42:26,151
Maybe you can give me a little advice.

727
00:42:27,061 --> 00:42:29,188
Now, if you were a man...

728
00:42:29,363 --> 00:42:32,890
...and a certain girl
had made a sucker out of you...

729
00:42:34,268 --> 00:42:35,257
Heh.

730
00:42:35,436 --> 00:42:39,805
...once upon a time,
how would you get even with her?

731
00:42:40,374 --> 00:42:44,140
- Well...
- I don't mean hurt her or anything like that.

732
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:46,973
But just make her change her mind
about me being a sucker.

733
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:50,446
Oh, why, you're only kidding,
Mr. Venizelos.

734
00:42:50,618 --> 00:42:52,882
How could anybody play you
for a sucker?

735
00:42:53,053 --> 00:42:56,318
No, no, no, I'm not kidding.
I'm serious, sister.

736
00:42:57,124 --> 00:43:00,924
I'd just like to get a little satisfaction
out of that young lady.

737
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:04,588
Now, how would you go about it?

738
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:08,896
- Well, if I were a man...
- Yeah?

739
00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:12,937
The first thing I would do
would be send her some flowers.

740
00:43:13,107 --> 00:43:17,168
- Mm-hm.
- Then I'd follow it up with a bracelet.

741
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:23,647
Then if she's that kind of a girl,
well, the rest is easy.

742
00:43:24,084 --> 00:43:25,711
Bracelet?

743
00:43:25,886 --> 00:43:28,980
So you mean one of those things
they wear around their wrists?

744
00:43:29,156 --> 00:43:32,785
Yes, with diamonds in it.

745
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,450
Diamonds?

746
00:43:34,628 --> 00:43:35,788
Mm-hm.

747
00:43:35,963 --> 00:43:38,022
You're not this girl's manager, are you?

748
00:44:01,755 --> 00:44:03,086
Hmm.

749
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,991
Oh, here you are, Marie.
Take care of Blondie.

750
00:44:09,129 --> 00:44:11,324
Just let me know
anything I can do for you, sir.

751
00:44:11,498 --> 00:44:12,897
All right.

752
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,127
I want you to open that door
to that next room.

753
00:44:16,303 --> 00:44:19,568
And put these
first two suitcases in there.

754
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,139
Yes, sir.

755
00:44:21,308 --> 00:44:24,141
- Here, George.
- Thank you, sir.

756
00:44:28,515 --> 00:44:31,382
But, boss, I can't spend no half a bill.

757
00:44:31,552 --> 00:44:34,180
You'll get the other half
at the other end of the line...

758
00:44:34,355 --> 00:44:35,822
...if you're a good boy.

759
00:44:35,989 --> 00:44:40,323
Yes, sir. I won't be good, I'll be perfect.

760
00:44:40,494 --> 00:44:42,519
Come here, give me luck.

761
00:44:42,696 --> 00:44:44,664
Yes, sir. You sure have luck now.

762
00:44:44,832 --> 00:44:47,733
Oh, George, what room is Mr. Short in?

763
00:44:47,901 --> 00:44:50,062
- Mr. Short...
- Yeah, Hickory Short.

764
00:44:50,237 --> 00:44:52,171
Oh, he's in 3-A, sir.

765
00:44:52,339 --> 00:44:55,240
- All right, scram.
- Yes, sir.

766
00:45:09,523 --> 00:45:13,118
Marie, open the suitcase
and hang up my checkered suit.

767
00:45:14,762 --> 00:45:17,754
Well, boy, this is the payoff.

768
00:45:17,931 --> 00:45:21,094
I wish the crowd back in the old
barbershop could see us now.

769
00:45:21,268 --> 00:45:25,068
Louisville bound with a bank roll
big enough to choke a cow.

770
00:45:26,774 --> 00:45:30,141
I guess after tonight,
I'll send the boys back home a few thou.

771
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,902
You've already paid them double.

772
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:33,774
What of it? I got plenty.

773
00:45:33,947 --> 00:45:37,383
Besides, ain't they still my pals? Heh-heh.

774
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,752
Neck to neck, Nick.

775
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,083
Make every post a winning one.

776
00:45:42,256 --> 00:45:45,123
If I lose,
I'll be back in the old barbershop...

777
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:48,056
...matching pennies with Snake Eyes.
- Heh-heh.

778
00:45:48,228 --> 00:45:50,355
But how can I lose? Heh-heh.

779
00:46:34,773 --> 00:46:36,638
- Good evening, boys.
- Good evening, boss.

780
00:46:36,809 --> 00:46:38,106
Here, try these.

781
00:46:38,277 --> 00:46:40,142
A fellow in Havana
makes them up for me.

782
00:46:40,312 --> 00:46:41,336
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

783
00:46:41,513 --> 00:46:42,844
Hello, Nick.
- Oh, hello, Tom.

784
00:46:43,015 --> 00:46:45,779
Say, can you let me
have another key for a friend of mine?

785
00:46:45,951 --> 00:46:47,509
Who for? The district attorney?

786
00:46:47,686 --> 00:46:49,347
No, chief of police.

787
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:51,512
Oh, in that case, you can have mine.

788
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,089
Great. Thanks.

789
00:47:00,132 --> 00:47:02,191
Good evening. How are you?

790
00:47:02,935 --> 00:47:04,300
- Good evening.
Good evening.

791
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,165
May I have your hat and coat?

792
00:47:06,739 --> 00:47:09,173
I'll give it to you this time.

793
00:47:09,908 --> 00:47:11,739
- How are they treating you?
- Just fine.

794
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:14,003
- Say, you're new here, aren't you?
- Yes.

795
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:16,238
- Oh, you'll like it. Heh-heh.
- Thank you.

796
00:47:16,415 --> 00:47:18,246
- You know who I am?
- Yes, sir.

797
00:47:20,252 --> 00:47:21,310
Oh, uh...

798
00:47:21,487 --> 00:47:25,014
- Straighten that painting.
- Yes, sir.

799
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,257
Mm. Not bad.

800
00:48:00,058 --> 00:48:03,152
Oh, Nick. Nick, look what I've won.

801
00:48:03,328 --> 00:48:04,795
My luck finally changed.

802
00:48:04,963 --> 00:48:07,056
- I just can't seem to lose.
- No?

803
00:48:07,232 --> 00:48:09,496
- How much did you win?
- A hundred and 10 dollars.

804
00:48:09,668 --> 00:48:11,363
Here, let me see.

805
00:48:11,603 --> 00:48:15,198
Twenty, 40, 60, 80, 90, a hundred.

806
00:48:15,374 --> 00:48:17,342
Great. Just what you owe me.

807
00:48:17,509 --> 00:48:19,238
- What I owe you?
- Yeah.

808
00:48:19,411 --> 00:48:23,040
You never did have a good memory.
Here.

809
00:48:23,215 --> 00:48:26,810
Why, Nick. What do you mean?

810
00:48:28,921 --> 00:48:30,684
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.

811
00:48:30,856 --> 00:48:32,153
How are you doing now, baby?

812
00:48:32,324 --> 00:48:34,121
Great. I've been playing the red.

813
00:48:34,293 --> 00:48:36,454
Here's a hundred,
put that on the red too.

814
00:48:36,628 --> 00:48:38,459
Oh, Nick.

815
00:48:40,432 --> 00:48:41,694
- You darling.
- Ha-ha-ha.

816
00:48:41,867 --> 00:48:43,164
All down?
All down.

817
00:48:43,335 --> 00:48:45,200
Attagirl. Heh-heh.

818
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:05,889
What are we gonna do about it?

819
00:49:06,058 --> 00:49:08,891
Every time we raid Nick,
he proves he doesn't own the place.

820
00:49:09,061 --> 00:49:13,555
He's got a phony front for every one of his
joints. And you can't pin anything on him.

821
00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:17,034
That isn't a suggestion. That's an alibi.

822
00:49:17,202 --> 00:49:19,864
We close him one night
and he opens up the next in another spot.

823
00:49:21,507 --> 00:49:23,737
Another alibi.

824
00:49:23,909 --> 00:49:26,139
Now, I demand a showdown.

825
00:49:26,311 --> 00:49:27,539
With election coming up...

826
00:49:27,713 --> 00:49:30,876
...I'm not going to let a tinhorn gambler
put me in the middle.

827
00:49:31,049 --> 00:49:32,539
We found Sleepy Sam, chief.

828
00:49:32,718 --> 00:49:34,345
He got in from Frisco last week.

829
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,283
- Where is he?
- In there.

830
00:49:36,455 --> 00:49:38,616
Boys, I'd like to see him alone.

831
00:49:45,964 --> 00:49:48,432
- Sam?
- How are you, DA?

832
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,830
Just step into my office.

833
00:49:59,945 --> 00:50:03,312
- Anything new on that case?
- Something hot.

834
00:50:03,482 --> 00:50:06,349
- I'll talk to you later.
- All right.

835
00:50:11,089 --> 00:50:13,114
Glad to see you, Sam.

836
00:50:13,825 --> 00:50:15,452
How have you been?

837
00:50:16,028 --> 00:50:17,120
What's up, Black?

838
00:50:17,296 --> 00:50:19,992
I just want to get some
gambling information from you, Sam.

839
00:50:20,165 --> 00:50:24,158
Yeah?
Well, three of a kind still beat two pair.

840
00:50:24,336 --> 00:50:26,167
Don't be a comedian.

841
00:50:26,338 --> 00:50:29,034
I don't know anything about it.
I've been legit for months.

842
00:50:29,207 --> 00:50:31,869
- What made you quit?
- I got tired of it. What's it to you?

843
00:50:32,044 --> 00:50:36,447
Yes, you got tired of it after Nick the Barber
pushed you over and rubbed it in.

844
00:50:36,615 --> 00:50:39,243
I understand he took your girl too.

845
00:50:39,418 --> 00:50:41,716
If you know so much,
what did you send for me for?

846
00:50:41,887 --> 00:50:43,184
Listen, Sam.

847
00:50:43,355 --> 00:50:45,721
We're both holding the same bag.

848
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:49,588
This little greaseball, Nick,
is giving us both the runaround.

849
00:50:49,995 --> 00:50:53,624
Why don't you come clean?
Tell me how to bring him down.

850
00:50:53,799 --> 00:50:56,393
If I knew, I'd do it myself.

851
00:50:57,769 --> 00:50:59,202
He must have some weakness.

852
00:51:00,572 --> 00:51:03,063
He's just a smalltime hick at heart.

853
00:51:03,241 --> 00:51:05,004
But just dumb enough to be smart.

854
00:51:05,944 --> 00:51:08,708
If you were the district attorney,
how would you tackle him?

855
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,281
I'd shoot him some night
when he was trying to escape from the law.

856
00:51:12,451 --> 00:51:15,579
Don't be silly. That isn't done.

857
00:51:15,754 --> 00:51:19,212
- Well, you know his weakness, don't you?
- What?

858
00:51:19,558 --> 00:51:20,820
Heh.

859
00:51:21,426 --> 00:51:25,157
He's nuts for blonds. Yeah.

860
00:51:26,665 --> 00:51:30,123
Send your wife around,
he'll go for any old bag.

861
00:51:30,302 --> 00:51:32,031
Why, you... Grr.

862
00:51:33,105 --> 00:51:36,370
A little rub, Nick?
- Yeah, I don't mind.

863
00:51:36,775 --> 00:51:38,970
Now, what is it you boys wanna know?

864
00:51:39,144 --> 00:51:43,547
We want to know what you've got to say to
this latest blast from the district attorney.

865
00:51:43,715 --> 00:51:45,342
Oh, has he been talking about me?

866
00:51:45,517 --> 00:51:47,781
Look at that.
He's throwing kisses at you again.

867
00:51:49,755 --> 00:51:51,655
Why, he's got me all wrong, boys.

868
00:51:51,823 --> 00:51:55,520
I'm not a gambler, I'm a barber.
This is my shop.

869
00:51:55,694 --> 00:51:57,321
This is the only business I've got.

870
00:51:57,496 --> 00:51:59,896
Nick the Barber,
isn't that what everybody calls me?

871
00:52:00,065 --> 00:52:02,590
What's he wanna go ahead
and make a lot of trouble for?

872
00:52:02,768 --> 00:52:05,066
I'm just a nice little fella
trying to get along.

873
00:52:05,237 --> 00:52:07,933
What's he wanna go ahead
and blow a lot of steam off for?

874
00:52:08,106 --> 00:52:12,008
You know, he reminds me of a little sawmill
we had in our old hometown in Irontown.

875
00:52:12,177 --> 00:52:14,577
It had a big whistle,
every time the whistle blew...

876
00:52:14,746 --> 00:52:15,974
...the sawmill stopped running.

877
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:18,644
Yeah.

878
00:52:18,817 --> 00:52:21,149
Then you're going to keep
your place open as usual?

879
00:52:21,319 --> 00:52:25,050
Well, why not? There's no law
against running a barbershop, is there?

880
00:52:26,825 --> 00:52:28,452
You're too smart for one guy, Nick.

881
00:52:28,627 --> 00:52:31,255
- Yeah, I ought to incorporate, huh?
Yeah.

882
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:33,159
Here, have a cigar, boys.

883
00:52:33,565 --> 00:52:35,396
A fella in Havana makes them up for me.

884
00:52:35,567 --> 00:52:36,898
- Is that so?
- Help yourselves.

885
00:52:37,069 --> 00:52:39,902
- Sure.
- I'm not forgetting you, old boy.

886
00:52:40,072 --> 00:52:42,165
- Well, so long.
- So long.

887
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,602
See you in the jailhouse.

888
00:52:43,775 --> 00:52:46,039
Sure, I'll come and visit you
in the can anytime, brother.

889
00:52:47,379 --> 00:52:48,471
So long.

890
00:52:48,647 --> 00:52:49,671
So long.

891
00:52:49,848 --> 00:52:50,872
Good luck, Nick.

892
00:52:51,049 --> 00:52:53,779
I gotta catch this next edition, Nick.
Thanks very much.

893
00:52:53,952 --> 00:52:56,011
Well, pleasure was all mine, boys.
Heh-heh.

894
00:52:56,488 --> 00:52:59,685
Boss, you're sure one smart fellow.

895
00:52:59,858 --> 00:53:02,725
- You sure tell them a big mouthful.
- Yeah.

896
00:53:02,894 --> 00:53:05,692
If that cheap district attorney get too fresh...

897
00:53:05,864 --> 00:53:07,832
...Nick the Barber give him close shave.

898
00:53:15,073 --> 00:53:17,041
Place your bets.

899
00:54:10,428 --> 00:54:12,953
Now, don't be jealous, pal.

900
00:54:26,545 --> 00:54:27,876
Oh.

901
00:54:28,046 --> 00:54:30,674
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

902
00:54:30,849 --> 00:54:34,285
- Are you Mr. Venizelos?
- Well, you've got the right fellow.

903
00:54:34,452 --> 00:54:35,942
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.

904
00:54:40,826 --> 00:54:44,262
- I wonder, Mr. Venizelos, if you could...
- Oh, call me Nick.

905
00:54:45,497 --> 00:54:47,226
- Well, I'm in an awful plight.
- Yeah?

906
00:54:47,399 --> 00:54:49,458
I've lost all my money
at the roulette table.

907
00:54:50,468 --> 00:54:52,959
And I wonder if you could lend me some
to get home on.

908
00:54:53,738 --> 00:54:56,070
I don't believe in lending,
but I'll give you 10.

909
00:54:56,541 --> 00:54:58,975
Ten? Oh, I need 500.

910
00:54:59,144 --> 00:55:00,372
Five hundred?

911
00:55:00,545 --> 00:55:02,069
Where do you live, lady? China?

912
00:55:06,218 --> 00:55:07,651
Oh.

913
00:55:07,919 --> 00:55:10,513
I could leave this for security.

914
00:55:10,689 --> 00:55:13,283
Hmm. You can't go wrong on that.

915
00:55:13,458 --> 00:55:16,655
- It's worth nearly a thousand.
- You know jewelry, all right.

916
00:55:16,828 --> 00:55:19,422
And women too.

917
00:55:19,598 --> 00:55:22,362
You know, it's my business
to make a study of human nature.

918
00:55:22,534 --> 00:55:25,094
And I can see that you're on the level.

919
00:55:25,503 --> 00:55:28,529
I've heard how fascinating you are
to women, Mr. Venizelos...

920
00:55:28,707 --> 00:55:30,971
...but the stories only half told it.

921
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:34,007
Hmm. Heh-heh-heh.

922
00:55:34,179 --> 00:55:36,306
Well, I think that deserves a drink,
don't you?

923
00:55:36,481 --> 00:55:38,915
- How about it?
- Fine.

924
00:55:44,522 --> 00:55:45,546
Thank you.

925
00:55:45,724 --> 00:55:47,988
Here's to the most charming man
I've ever met.

926
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:51,720
And here's to the most charming woman
I've ever met.

927
00:55:57,202 --> 00:55:59,864
- Ahh.
- You're certainly a friend in need.

928
00:56:00,972 --> 00:56:04,840
Big-hearted Nick, they call me.
Never said no to a woman in my life.

929
00:56:05,477 --> 00:56:09,573
I'll take you to the cashier's and get
the money. Oh, don't let's forget this.

930
00:56:11,016 --> 00:56:12,347
There.

931
00:56:12,517 --> 00:56:15,975
Tell me, when am I gonna see you again?

932
00:56:16,154 --> 00:56:17,849
When would you like to?

933
00:56:18,023 --> 00:56:20,958
Tomorrow for lunch, at the Savoy?

934
00:56:21,126 --> 00:56:22,787
Yes, that would be splendid.

935
00:56:22,961 --> 00:56:25,589
You give me your address,
I'll send my car for you.

936
00:56:25,764 --> 00:56:27,857
No, thanks.
Never mind, I'll just take a taxi.

937
00:56:28,033 --> 00:56:30,968
Oh, no, no, no. I wouldn't think
of you doing that. Ha-ha-ha.

938
00:56:31,136 --> 00:56:34,196
Oh, that's all right.
I'll meet you there, Nick.

939
00:56:36,074 --> 00:56:37,837
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

940
00:56:38,009 --> 00:56:42,002
And tell the district attorney
I'll see him on Tuesday.

941
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:57,858
Hello? Hello?
Say, get me the district attorney...

942
00:56:58,029 --> 00:56:59,394
...at his home right away.

943
00:57:02,834 --> 00:57:04,301
I'll answer it.

944
00:57:04,469 --> 00:57:06,562
- Hello?
- Hello, is that you, Black?

945
00:57:06,738 --> 00:57:08,137
Well, this is Nick the Barber.

946
00:57:08,306 --> 00:57:10,831
I just kicked your stool pigeon
right out of my office.

947
00:57:11,009 --> 00:57:14,809
If you don't quit messing around my affairs,
I'm gonna kick you right out of town.

948
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,278
A stool pigeon?
What did she do to tip her mitt?

949
00:57:17,449 --> 00:57:18,973
Oh, boy, I can tell them.

950
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:21,914
She had "district attorney"
written right across her kisser.

951
00:57:22,087 --> 00:57:25,579
Before I got through with her, she had
Nick the Barber written across her...

952
00:57:25,757 --> 00:57:27,782
...something else.
- Heh-heh.

953
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:29,824
- Congratulations.
- Yeah.

954
00:57:29,995 --> 00:57:31,587
You got wise to yourself at last.

955
00:57:31,763 --> 00:57:34,391
No woman will ever make
a sucker out of me again.

956
00:57:34,566 --> 00:57:37,763
Nick is plenty smart these days. Yes, sir.

957
00:57:37,936 --> 00:57:39,995
- Oh, boy. Ha-ha.
- Heh-heh.

958
00:57:47,278 --> 00:57:50,145
Boy, I'll never forgot the expression
on that dame's pan...

959
00:57:50,315 --> 00:57:51,407
...when I gave her the boot.

960
00:57:52,751 --> 00:57:54,946
Probably the first time
she was kicked out of an office.

961
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,109
Yeah.

962
00:58:04,462 --> 00:58:06,191
What's that?

963
00:58:06,831 --> 00:58:07,957
Stop, Bill.

964
00:58:11,636 --> 00:58:13,604
- What's the matter?
- We dragged a girl out.

965
00:58:13,772 --> 00:58:15,330
- Will you take her?
- Where is she?

966
00:58:15,507 --> 00:58:19,204
- Right over there.
- Go on, let's see.

967
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:24,139
Still alive?
Yes.

968
00:58:24,315 --> 00:58:25,805
Get a robe, quick.
Yes, sir.

969
00:58:25,984 --> 00:58:27,417
We'll take her to the hospital.

970
00:58:27,585 --> 00:58:30,213
Wait a minute,
what do you know about this dame?

971
00:58:30,388 --> 00:58:32,413
Well, all I know she's almost drowned.

972
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:34,319
Come on. Quickly, get her in the car.

973
00:58:34,492 --> 00:58:36,585
Get her in the car now.

974
00:58:40,632 --> 00:58:42,532
I'll take care of her.

975
00:58:42,867 --> 00:58:44,596
- All right, George, pick up.
Attaboy.

976
00:58:44,769 --> 00:58:47,203
- All right.
- Go on, step on it.

977
00:58:54,579 --> 00:58:57,377
How do you know she's not another plant
from the DA's office?

978
00:58:57,549 --> 00:59:00,245
I suppose they brought her here
and threw her in the water.

979
00:59:00,418 --> 00:59:03,785
Well, don't forget,
you can still pour water.

980
00:59:03,955 --> 00:59:05,650
Smart fella, aren't you?

981
00:59:05,824 --> 00:59:07,223
Here.

982
00:59:08,793 --> 00:59:10,954
Attagirl.

983
00:59:13,731 --> 00:59:15,790
- Where am I?
- You're all right.

984
00:59:15,967 --> 00:59:18,094
- We're taking you to the hospital.
- Where?

985
00:59:18,269 --> 00:59:20,533
To the Receiving Hospital.
Now, don't get excited.

986
00:59:20,705 --> 00:59:22,730
Oh, please don't take me to the hospital.

987
00:59:22,907 --> 00:59:26,900
I don't wanna go there. I won't go there.

988
00:59:27,078 --> 00:59:31,310
- What did I tell you?
- Now, don't get yourself all worked up.

989
00:59:32,684 --> 00:59:37,212
Let me out here and I'll go home.
I can get a bus.

990
00:59:37,388 --> 00:59:39,515
No, you can't do that. You're all wet.

991
00:59:39,691 --> 00:59:42,956
- You'll catch pneumonia.
- I'll be all right.

992
00:59:43,128 --> 00:59:46,359
Let her go if she wants to.
We might get into a jam.

993
00:59:46,531 --> 00:59:48,158
You don't know what her racket is.

994
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:50,824
Bill, come on, pull up to the curb.

995
01:00:03,047 --> 01:00:05,880
Say, I think you'd better take
that robe with you. It's cold.

996
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:07,415
No, I'll be all right.

997
01:00:07,585 --> 01:00:11,146
Thank you very much. It was kind of you.

998
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:14,791
Oh, Jack, Jack. Come here, get her.

999
01:00:14,959 --> 01:00:16,290
The act is on again.

1000
01:00:16,461 --> 01:00:18,258
It looks as though the kid is starved.

1001
01:00:18,429 --> 01:00:20,192
I suppose you call that fixing too.

1002
01:00:20,365 --> 01:00:22,390
- What do you wanna do?
- Put her in the car.

1003
01:00:22,567 --> 01:00:25,127
We'll take her home.
What do you think we're gonna do?

1004
01:00:25,303 --> 01:00:28,295
Come on, take care of her now. Easy.

1005
01:00:30,775 --> 01:00:34,302
Well, what are you gonna do
about that girl?

1006
01:00:34,479 --> 01:00:36,003
Are you running a sanitarium?

1007
01:00:36,181 --> 01:00:39,378
Are you still harping on that?
Put on a new record.

1008
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:43,214
Haven't you had enough trouble with dames
without going out and looking for it?

1009
01:00:43,388 --> 01:00:44,855
I wouldn't trust any of them.

1010
01:00:45,023 --> 01:00:47,116
But you gotta admit,
they're awfully nice company.

1011
01:00:47,292 --> 01:00:48,452
Ahh...

1012
01:00:48,626 --> 01:00:50,560
Oh, why don't you snap out of it?

1013
01:00:50,728 --> 01:00:54,494
Say, your face is so long,
I'd charge you two prices for a shave.

1014
01:00:56,834 --> 01:00:58,267
What, you up?

1015
01:00:58,436 --> 01:01:00,495
Probably got a date with her manager.

1016
01:01:00,672 --> 01:01:02,367
Yes, I'm leaving.

1017
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:05,168
I just wanted to thank you
for being so kind.

1018
01:01:05,343 --> 01:01:06,640
Oh, don't thank him, lady.

1019
01:01:06,811 --> 01:01:09,075
He loves playing St. Nick for dames.

1020
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:12,008
He picks up a woman every week,
just to keep in practice.

1021
01:01:12,217 --> 01:01:14,583
Don't mind him.
He's rehearsing a vaudeville act.

1022
01:01:14,752 --> 01:01:18,848
And if he lets out one more crack,
I'll ring the curtain right down on his chin.

1023
01:01:22,961 --> 01:01:26,294
You can't walk out like this.
The doctor said you might get pneumonia.

1024
01:01:27,398 --> 01:01:29,229
Even the doctors play him for a sucker.

1025
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:32,665
Say, why don't you wisen up?
Give her a break.

1026
01:01:34,939 --> 01:01:36,600
- Snake Eyes.
- Yes, sir?

1027
01:01:36,774 --> 01:01:39,265
- Draw another cup of java.
- Coming right up, boss.

1028
01:01:39,777 --> 01:01:43,042
I think you better stay put for a few days.
You look plenty weak.

1029
01:01:43,214 --> 01:01:45,409
<i>Like The Wreck of the Hesperus?</i>

1030
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:46,982
Yeah, something like that.

1031
01:01:47,685 --> 01:01:50,586
I have a few questions
I wanna ask this young lady.

1032
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:54,718
- Do you know who we are?
- No.

1033
01:01:54,892 --> 01:01:56,826
Only you've been very kind.

1034
01:01:57,862 --> 01:02:00,956
- Have you ever heard of Nick the Barber?
- Yes.

1035
01:02:01,332 --> 01:02:03,425
I've read about him in the papers.

1036
01:02:03,601 --> 01:02:05,831
He's a gambler, isn't?

1037
01:02:06,371 --> 01:02:08,236
Oh, I recognize you now.

1038
01:02:08,406 --> 01:02:10,374
Heh-heh-heh.

1039
01:02:10,541 --> 01:02:12,372
And you've never seen him before?

1040
01:02:12,543 --> 01:02:14,408
Only pictures in the newspapers.

1041
01:02:16,147 --> 01:02:19,173
Well, lady, you must have some cream.
Heh-heh.

1042
01:02:19,751 --> 01:02:22,242
Why did you jump off that bridge
last night?

1043
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:24,047
Are you sure you didn't fall off?

1044
01:02:25,657 --> 01:02:27,648
Say, what are you,
a policeman or something?

1045
01:02:27,825 --> 01:02:30,692
Go on, get dressed.
I know what I'm doing.

1046
01:02:31,129 --> 01:02:32,619
Go on.

1047
01:02:36,768 --> 01:02:38,599
Mother knows best.

1048
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:41,438
Your friend doesn't like me very well.

1049
01:02:41,873 --> 01:02:43,841
Don't take what that loogan
said seriously.

1050
01:02:44,008 --> 01:02:46,533
- Really, he's a swell fellow.
- That's all right.

1051
01:02:46,711 --> 01:02:47,905
I'm used to abuse.

1052
01:02:50,882 --> 01:02:54,283
Hey, you'll be having Blondie
crying in a minute. Heh-heh.

1053
01:02:54,452 --> 01:02:56,181
Come on, get hold of yourself.

1054
01:02:56,354 --> 01:03:00,688
- Were you working?
- I was, but I lost my job.

1055
01:03:00,858 --> 01:03:02,723
And then I got sick.

1056
01:03:02,894 --> 01:03:06,125
- Yeah, and you were broke, huh?
- I had a few dollars.

1057
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:10,063
And some more things
happened and... Heh.

1058
01:03:10,234 --> 01:03:12,202
Then last night.

1059
01:03:13,705 --> 01:03:17,334
I don't suppose
it's very easy for you girls.

1060
01:03:18,576 --> 01:03:20,134
I was a coward.

1061
01:03:20,311 --> 01:03:21,403
Oh-ho-ho, coward...

1062
01:03:21,579 --> 01:03:24,946
Say, lots of people would be cowards
if they went through what you did.

1063
01:03:25,116 --> 01:03:26,708
But I'm all straightened out now.

1064
01:03:26,884 --> 01:03:29,853
- Attagirl.
- I feel like a new person.

1065
01:03:32,757 --> 01:03:35,055
- Thanks for what you did.
- Oh-ho.

1066
01:03:35,226 --> 01:03:37,217
It's nothing, really. Heh-heh.

1067
01:03:37,395 --> 01:03:39,454
Oh, here.

1068
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:41,222
You'll need a little stake.

1069
01:03:41,399 --> 01:03:44,960
- It's awfully kind of you, but I can't...
- Oh, that's all right. Come on.

1070
01:03:45,136 --> 01:03:47,161
I'll probably never be able to pay it back.

1071
01:03:47,338 --> 01:03:51,365
Well, that's all right, sister.
I own the mint. My brother gave it to me.

1072
01:03:52,977 --> 01:03:56,970
- Thanks. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1073
01:04:00,151 --> 01:04:02,278
And keep off of bridges.

1074
01:04:07,892 --> 01:04:11,794
- Here, what's the matter?
- Oh, I was just a little dizzy.

1075
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:14,261
But I feel all right again.

1076
01:04:14,432 --> 01:04:15,763
Now, look here.

1077
01:04:15,933 --> 01:04:17,400
You're not going out of here.

1078
01:04:17,568 --> 01:04:20,264
Not until you're better
and get some color in those cheeks.

1079
01:04:20,438 --> 01:04:23,430
You're set on keeping that date
with the undertakers, aren't you?

1080
01:04:23,608 --> 01:04:24,905
Nothing doing, you stay put.

1081
01:04:25,076 --> 01:04:27,772
You take orders from me,
I'm taking orders from the doctor.

1082
01:04:27,945 --> 01:04:30,311
The doctor's coming up
to see you sometime today.

1083
01:04:30,481 --> 01:04:33,416
And you're not going out
till he says the word.

1084
01:04:33,584 --> 01:04:35,484
Now, be a good girl.

1085
01:04:57,708 --> 01:05:00,040
Oh, here's the key.

1086
01:05:21,866 --> 01:05:24,198
Well, I'm glad to see
you get rid of that ghost.

1087
01:05:24,368 --> 01:05:26,393
That dame gave me the creeps.

1088
01:05:26,571 --> 01:05:28,664
Well, you'd make a great copper.

1089
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:32,640
You can guess more right things wrong
than anybody I know.

1090
01:05:33,444 --> 01:05:35,207
Well, where is she, then?

1091
01:05:35,379 --> 01:05:38,109
In the bedroom, wise guy.

1092
01:05:38,783 --> 01:05:40,717
Say, how long is this gonna last?

1093
01:05:40,885 --> 01:05:44,082
- What's the big idea, you going screwy?
- Why don't you button up?

1094
01:05:44,255 --> 01:05:47,418
I'm only doing what any decent guy
in the same spot would do.

1095
01:05:47,592 --> 01:05:49,526
She'll be gone in a couple of days.

1096
01:05:49,694 --> 01:05:53,152
And then you can be
my sweetheart again, dearie.

1097
01:05:53,998 --> 01:05:54,987
Ahh...

1098
01:06:03,474 --> 01:06:06,466
- I've good news for you, Snake Eyes.
- Yes, ma'am?

1099
01:06:06,644 --> 01:06:09,545
This is the last time I'm gonna change
the furniture around.

1100
01:06:09,714 --> 01:06:10,738
I'm glad to hear that.

1101
01:06:10,915 --> 01:06:14,373
I done thought you was gonna wear
this furniture out, kicking it around.

1102
01:06:14,552 --> 01:06:16,383
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1103
01:06:16,554 --> 01:06:18,579
- Have a good sleep?
- I feel fine.

1104
01:06:18,756 --> 01:06:20,485
Good.

1105
01:06:20,925 --> 01:06:24,224
Well, so you've been at it again.

1106
01:06:24,395 --> 01:06:27,660
- Do you really like it?
- It looks swell.

1107
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,264
What did you do with that picture
of Jack Dempsey?

1108
01:06:31,435 --> 01:06:32,459
I put it in your den.

1109
01:06:32,637 --> 01:06:34,832
- You don't mind, do you?
- Oh, that's all right.

1110
01:06:35,006 --> 01:06:37,702
Say, you can put Tunney
in the cellar if you want to. Ha-ha-ha.

1111
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:40,673
It's been so much fun
fixing up a place like this.

1112
01:06:40,845 --> 01:06:46,044
Yeah, I like it better myself,
since you've been around.

1113
01:06:46,517 --> 01:06:47,950
Sit down, Nick.

1114
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:50,986
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

1115
01:06:51,155 --> 01:06:52,782
Yeah?

1116
01:06:53,891 --> 01:06:55,620
Why...

1117
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:57,625
What's on your mind, baby?

1118
01:06:58,729 --> 01:07:01,027
Why have you been so nice to me?

1119
01:07:02,366 --> 01:07:03,833
Oh, well, that's my nature.

1120
01:07:04,001 --> 01:07:06,663
Big-hearted Nick, they used to call me
back in Irontown.

1121
01:07:06,837 --> 01:07:08,168
You've done so much.

1122
01:07:08,339 --> 01:07:10,807
There doesn't seem to be anything
I can do for you.

1123
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:14,138
Why, you've done plenty.
Just being around is enough.

1124
01:07:14,312 --> 01:07:16,576
Don't you worry about that.

1125
01:07:17,148 --> 01:07:18,979
What's the matter?

1126
01:07:21,752 --> 01:07:26,451
- I was thinking maybe...
- Yeah?

1127
01:07:31,462 --> 01:07:33,828
Oh, no, no, no.

1128
01:07:33,998 --> 01:07:36,023
No, you don't owe me anything.

1129
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:38,134
Now, you stay here as long as you like.

1130
01:07:38,302 --> 01:07:40,793
And the longer you stay,
the better I like it.

1131
01:07:40,972 --> 01:07:42,496
And someday, maybe...

1132
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:43,900
Oh!

1133
01:07:44,075 --> 01:07:46,976
Now, here, here, what's all this about?

1134
01:07:47,144 --> 01:07:49,942
Now, please, don't cry, baby.

1135
01:07:50,114 --> 01:07:53,015
There isn't a thing for you
to worry about.

1136
01:07:53,184 --> 01:07:54,583
What's on your mind, honey?

1137
01:07:55,186 --> 01:07:57,484
I haven't been
on the level with you, Nick.

1138
01:07:58,356 --> 01:08:01,416
- You're not from the DA's office?
- No.

1139
01:08:01,592 --> 01:08:04,288
But I haven't told you
the whole truth about myself.

1140
01:08:04,462 --> 01:08:09,024
Oh, that's all right. I haven't told you
the whole truth about myself either.

1141
01:08:10,134 --> 01:08:12,125
Did you know
I used to play the saxophone...

1142
01:08:12,303 --> 01:08:14,965
...in the Irontown band?
- Heh.

1143
01:08:15,139 --> 01:08:17,334
I'm serious, Nick.

1144
01:08:17,508 --> 01:08:21,444
- I'm wanted by the police.
- Police?

1145
01:08:21,612 --> 01:08:24,206
- What for?
- For blackmail.

1146
01:08:24,382 --> 01:08:27,647
- Blackmail?
- But it really wasn't blackmail.

1147
01:08:27,818 --> 01:08:31,015
I mean, I didn't intend
to blackmail him at all.

1148
01:08:31,188 --> 01:08:33,315
I wanted you to know.

1149
01:08:33,491 --> 01:08:35,823
I might get you into some trouble
with the police.

1150
01:08:37,328 --> 01:08:38,795
Police don't bother me none.

1151
01:08:38,963 --> 01:08:41,932
As far as they're concerned,
I'm just a barbershop proprietor.

1152
01:08:42,099 --> 01:08:43,794
They haven't got a thing on me.

1153
01:08:43,968 --> 01:08:46,835
- But don't you want me to get out now?
- What for?

1154
01:08:47,004 --> 01:08:49,472
I'm not exactly
a Sunday school teacher myself.

1155
01:08:51,042 --> 01:08:53,602
I seem to be kind of a jinx wherever I go.

1156
01:08:53,778 --> 01:08:56,941
Well, you haven't been a jinx to me.

1157
01:09:03,988 --> 01:09:06,081
I hate to do this.

1158
01:09:07,158 --> 01:09:08,921
But it's the only way we can nail him.

1159
01:09:09,093 --> 01:09:11,084
Of course,
it's really compounding a felony.

1160
01:09:11,996 --> 01:09:13,258
Well, what of it?

1161
01:09:13,431 --> 01:09:15,558
The end justifies the means.

1162
01:09:15,733 --> 01:09:18,531
And we've got to drive Nick
out of this town.

1163
01:09:18,969 --> 01:09:23,167
The disgrace is we have to resort to
such roundabout methods to get him.

1164
01:09:24,308 --> 01:09:26,868
But if we can put him in jail
for only a few months...

1165
01:09:27,044 --> 01:09:29,239
...we can break up his ring.

1166
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,007
The public and the press will lay off me.

1167
01:09:33,617 --> 01:09:36,415
The girl is here.
I picked her up at the Savoy.

1168
01:09:36,587 --> 01:09:38,282
Send her in.

1169
01:09:39,790 --> 01:09:43,123
Miss Graham, come in.

1170
01:09:44,595 --> 01:09:46,756
How do you do, Miss Graham?

1171
01:09:49,133 --> 01:09:51,294
Sit down, please.

1172
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:03,312
Miss Graham, I have here a warrant
charging you with blackmail.

1173
01:10:05,616 --> 01:10:07,345
And enough evidence to convict you.

1174
01:10:07,518 --> 01:10:10,112
L... I didn't mean to blackmail him.

1175
01:10:10,287 --> 01:10:12,448
That's your story.

1176
01:10:12,723 --> 01:10:15,157
But what you did is extortion
in the eyes of the law.

1177
01:10:15,326 --> 01:10:17,658
And you can be sent to the penitentiary.

1178
01:10:18,195 --> 01:10:21,722
But there's a way you can avoid
going to the penitentiary, Miss Graham.

1179
01:10:21,899 --> 01:10:25,062
- A very simple way.
- What do you expect me to do?

1180
01:10:25,236 --> 01:10:27,636
Just a little favor.

1181
01:10:28,906 --> 01:10:33,036
While checking up on Nick the Barber,
we found that you live in his apartment.

1182
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:34,768
That isn't true.

1183
01:10:34,945 --> 01:10:36,879
I live in a spare room down the hall.

1184
01:10:37,047 --> 01:10:38,912
Now, don't lie.

1185
01:10:39,083 --> 01:10:42,314
We watched every step
both of you made for a week.

1186
01:10:44,755 --> 01:10:47,223
The sentence for blackmail,
Miss Graham...

1187
01:10:47,391 --> 01:10:49,985
...is two to 10 years in the penitentiary.

1188
01:10:50,161 --> 01:10:54,393
But you can avoid that
if you'll just do what I ask you.

1189
01:10:54,565 --> 01:10:56,931
- Well, what is it?
- Not much.

1190
01:10:58,435 --> 01:10:59,993
Just this.

1191
01:11:00,171 --> 01:11:04,164
I want you to get me those gold keys
that Nick's customers use for his gambling...

1192
01:11:04,341 --> 01:11:06,036
I won't.

1193
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:09,411
- I haven't finished, Miss Graham.
- I don't care, I won't do it.

1194
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:11,047
You can send me up.

1195
01:11:11,215 --> 01:11:12,978
Now, don't be foolish.

1196
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:15,914
It's a case of you or him.

1197
01:11:16,086 --> 01:11:17,553
He'll never know you did it.

1198
01:11:18,055 --> 01:11:21,354
I won't. I won't!

1199
01:11:22,359 --> 01:11:24,259
Now, don't get excited.

1200
01:11:24,428 --> 01:11:27,261
All we wanna do
is to give Nick a good scare.

1201
01:11:27,431 --> 01:11:30,400
He'll be out in a month.
That wouldn't hurt him at all.

1202
01:11:30,568 --> 01:11:33,469
While if you went to the penitentiary
for a long sentence...

1203
01:11:33,637 --> 01:11:38,370
But he's the only the person
that's ever been kind to me.

1204
01:11:39,143 --> 01:11:40,405
He's a public menace.

1205
01:11:40,578 --> 01:11:42,705
He's trying to corrupt public officials.

1206
01:11:43,714 --> 01:11:47,081
He's even put his filthy hands
on policemen, state's attorneys.

1207
01:11:47,251 --> 01:11:50,743
- And even made overtures to our judges.
- I can't help it.

1208
01:11:50,921 --> 01:11:53,048
Leave me alone.

1209
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:55,981
Please don't make me do it.

1210
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,492
Oh, please.

1211
01:11:58,863 --> 01:12:00,558
Please.

1212
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:10,935
- Have you a key, sir?
- Sure.

1213
01:12:25,956 --> 01:12:27,014
All bets down.

1214
01:12:32,897 --> 01:12:34,330
You look swell, baby.

1215
01:12:35,332 --> 01:12:38,699
You got class.
That's what I like about you.

1216
01:12:39,303 --> 01:12:43,239
I think you're about the prettiest
little thing I've ever seen.

1217
01:12:43,407 --> 01:12:44,874
And the sweetest.

1218
01:12:45,042 --> 01:12:48,876
- I'm not what you think I am, Nick.
- What, not sweet?

1219
01:12:49,446 --> 01:12:51,437
Don't tell me, I know.

1220
01:12:51,615 --> 01:12:53,480
Nick used to be a sugar taster.

1221
01:12:56,353 --> 01:12:58,446
I've got something for you.

1222
01:12:59,056 --> 01:13:00,580
There.

1223
01:13:03,661 --> 01:13:04,992
Here.

1224
01:13:06,063 --> 01:13:08,224
Doesn't that look nice there?

1225
01:13:08,966 --> 01:13:11,696
- I can't take it, Nick.
- Oh, yes, you can.

1226
01:13:11,869 --> 01:13:16,067
And what's more, before long,
I'm gonna give you a ring.

1227
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:18,071
For that finger.

1228
01:13:19,677 --> 01:13:21,508
What's the matter, honey?

1229
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:25,547
- You're shaking like a leaf.
- I'm all upset tonight, Nick.

1230
01:13:38,495 --> 01:13:41,658
Have you a key, sir?
No, we're with headquarters.

1231
01:13:42,466 --> 01:13:44,161
Go on, break in.

1232
01:13:47,871 --> 01:13:49,600
It's a raid. Get rid of the gun.

1233
01:14:17,701 --> 01:14:20,067
It's a raid. You stay right here.

1234
01:14:48,198 --> 01:14:50,894
Go get him. Get up.

1235
01:15:26,904 --> 01:15:28,838
I thought so.

1236
01:15:29,006 --> 01:15:31,133
It was you who let those coppers in.

1237
01:15:31,308 --> 01:15:33,299
You dirty little stool pigeon.

1238
01:15:33,477 --> 01:15:35,104
- Oh!
What's this all about?

1239
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:37,372
Lay off, Nick.
She's planting evidence on you.

1240
01:15:37,548 --> 01:15:39,015
She put it in the inside coat pocket.

1241
01:15:39,183 --> 01:15:41,117
- I'm telling you, now look for yourself.
- Hmm?

1242
01:15:41,452 --> 01:15:44,182
Why, it's nothing but a racing form,
you smack-off.

1243
01:15:44,354 --> 01:15:45,981
Lay off, I'm telling you. Quit it.

1244
01:15:46,156 --> 01:15:48,886
I'm trying to steer you straight.
Steer you straight.

1245
01:15:49,059 --> 01:15:51,425
- I'm gonna let you have it.
- Yes. You won't.

1246
01:15:51,595 --> 01:15:52,823
Yeah.

1247
01:15:54,264 --> 01:15:57,961
Yeah, I'll show him,
treating you like that.

1248
01:15:58,669 --> 01:16:02,002
Come on, Nick. Let's go downtown.

1249
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:06,868
What for? You got nothing on me.

1250
01:16:07,044 --> 01:16:09,171
I'm just a guest here,
like a hundred others.

1251
01:16:09,346 --> 01:16:10,472
I like your company.

1252
01:16:10,647 --> 01:16:13,138
You can't hang anything on me.
I don't own this place.

1253
01:16:13,317 --> 01:16:15,217
Look up the deed
in the Recorder's Office.

1254
01:16:15,385 --> 01:16:16,647
- You don't, eh?
- No.

1255
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:18,913
All I own here is what I've got on.

1256
01:16:19,089 --> 01:16:20,784
We like your company.

1257
01:16:20,958 --> 01:16:24,291
It's hot and stuffy here.
Let's take a walk.

1258
01:16:25,496 --> 01:16:26,554
Hmm.

1259
01:16:26,730 --> 01:16:28,561
You got good manners for cops.
Heh-heh.

1260
01:16:28,732 --> 01:16:31,724
All right, I'll oblige you.
For all the good it's gonna do you. Heh-heh.

1261
01:16:31,902 --> 01:16:33,733
All you've got here is what you got on.

1262
01:16:33,904 --> 01:16:35,565
- Is that it, Nick?
- Yeah, that's it.

1263
01:16:35,739 --> 01:16:37,764
Then you've got plenty.

1264
01:16:43,313 --> 01:16:45,008
That's nothing but a racing form.

1265
01:16:45,182 --> 01:16:47,446
You probably don't know
there's an old blue law...

1266
01:16:47,618 --> 01:16:51,054
...that classifies a racing form
as gambling paraphernalia.

1267
01:16:51,221 --> 01:16:55,487
Makes possession of one punishable
by a six-month jail sentence.

1268
01:16:55,659 --> 01:16:58,628
I didn't know it myself
till just a few days ago.

1269
01:16:58,795 --> 01:17:00,524
But I know it now, Nick.

1270
01:17:01,165 --> 01:17:03,133
And so do you.

1271
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:07,566
- Why, you dirty, you double-crosser...
Here.

1272
01:17:07,738 --> 01:17:10,366
- What's the matter with this fellow?
- I socked him.

1273
01:17:10,541 --> 01:17:12,771
And I'm darned sorry.
He didn't have it coming.

1274
01:17:12,943 --> 01:17:15,878
- He's unconscious.
- Let's be going, Nick.

1275
01:17:16,046 --> 01:17:20,073
- This fellow isn't unconscious. He's dead.
- What's that?

1276
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:22,411
Look out, here.

1277
01:17:23,887 --> 01:17:26,151
Jack! Jack!

1278
01:17:26,924 --> 01:17:30,189
Jack! Jack, I'm talking to you.

1279
01:17:30,627 --> 01:17:32,424
Jack.

1280
01:17:42,272 --> 01:17:44,137
It looks like manslaughter...

1281
01:17:44,308 --> 01:17:46,003
...or murder now, Nick.

1282
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:59,787
- So you gave me the works, huh?
- Yes, Nick.

1283
01:17:59,957 --> 01:18:01,686
I did it.

1284
01:18:02,292 --> 01:18:07,628
But I didn't think it would be for
anything like this.

1285
01:18:07,798 --> 01:18:10,892
I've always been a little coward.

1286
01:18:12,102 --> 01:18:16,163
Oh, Nick, could you ever forgive me?

1287
01:18:17,574 --> 01:18:19,940
That's all right, Irene.

1288
01:18:20,877 --> 01:18:24,040
I've always been a sucker for women.

1289
01:18:33,924 --> 01:18:36,552
Come on, Black. Let's go.

1290
01:18:49,873 --> 01:18:53,104
Hold it for a picture, Nick.
- Oh, sure, just a minute.

1291
01:18:54,511 --> 01:18:56,069
All right.

1292
01:18:56,413 --> 01:18:57,812
Thanks.

1293
01:19:04,554 --> 01:19:06,488
Yeah, Snake Eyes.

1294
01:19:06,657 --> 01:19:10,286
I brought Blondie along.
Thought you might like to say goodbye.

1295
01:19:10,460 --> 01:19:12,155
Yeah.

1296
01:19:13,764 --> 01:19:15,823
Hey, you sure
I can't take her along with me?

1297
01:19:15,999 --> 01:19:17,432
Nothing doing.

1298
01:19:17,601 --> 01:19:20,092
No blonds where you're going, Nick.

1299
01:19:20,404 --> 01:19:24,363
Well, Blondie,
no use two of us going up there, eh?

1300
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:27,533
- Take this rabbit's foot, boss.
- Not a chance.

1301
01:19:27,711 --> 01:19:29,542
You gave me one of those once before.

1302
01:19:29,713 --> 01:19:33,342
I didn't mean no harm,
because I loves you, Mr. Nick.

1303
01:19:33,517 --> 01:19:35,712
Here's the way to give me luck.

1304
01:19:37,754 --> 01:19:41,246
So long, Snake Eyes. I'll be seeing you.

1305
01:19:45,762 --> 01:19:47,161
Well...

1306
01:19:47,964 --> 01:19:50,933
Come on over, Marie, the water's fine.

1307
01:19:57,708 --> 01:19:59,505
I suppose I should be glad...

1308
01:19:59,676 --> 01:20:01,337
...you're going up, Nick...

1309
01:20:02,346 --> 01:20:06,214
...after the way you've treated me.
But I'm not.

1310
01:20:07,250 --> 01:20:10,447
I came down here to laugh in your face...

1311
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:11,780
...but I can't.

1312
01:20:11,955 --> 01:20:14,719
Oh, that's all right, Marie.

1313
01:20:15,892 --> 01:20:18,156
You're a swell guy.

1314
01:20:18,628 --> 01:20:20,596
I deserved what I got.

1315
01:20:20,764 --> 01:20:22,891
Oh, that's all right, Marie.

1316
01:20:23,066 --> 01:20:26,661
I'm sorry the way
everything turned out between us.

1317
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:30,301
I guess somebody must have been
dealing from the bottom.

1318
01:20:32,008 --> 01:20:34,977
Well, here.

1319
01:20:35,479 --> 01:20:36,810
Buy yourself a box of candy.

1320
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:39,414
You know I don't eat it.
It gets in my teeth. Heh-heh-heh.

1321
01:20:39,583 --> 01:20:40,709
All aboard.
- Yeah.

1322
01:20:40,884 --> 01:20:43,284
Come on, Nick, let's go.
- I'll be seeing you. Heh.

1323
01:20:43,453 --> 01:20:45,580
Hey, Nick, bye-bye.
I'll be seeing you.

1324
01:20:48,759 --> 01:20:51,227
Any final statement, Nick?
- Sure.

1325
01:20:51,395 --> 01:20:54,694
Tell my public I've put the close clippers

Hey, Nick. How about a picture?

1329
01:21:02,706 --> 01:21:05,698
All right, just a minute. I'll tell you when.
