1
00:05:59,823 --> 00:06:00,991
I think I can see it.

2
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:02,200
See what?

3
00:06:02,284 --> 00:06:03,410
The anchor.

4
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:04,995
There isn't one silly.

5
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:06,288
There is too.

6
00:06:06,371 --> 00:06:07,998
No, not really.

7
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:09,291
What is there then?

8
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:12,252
Well it's just a border
like anywhere else.

9
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:14,421
She's always seeing
things that aren't there.

10
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:16,423
Like that mermaid yesterday.

11
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:18,758
Well Anne will believe
me when she arrives.

12
00:06:18,842 --> 00:06:20,677
Oh she just humors you.

13
00:06:22,304 --> 00:06:23,722
Checkpoint ahead boys.

14
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:25,682
Now you take it up there and drop anchor.

15
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,517
Milly, come with me and
help me hide my tins

16
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:29,436
in the backup from the customs, come on.

17
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,353
Okay.

18
00:06:40,155 --> 00:06:41,615
Don't they have tobacco in Hungary?

19
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:44,951
Yeah of course there are,
but not my favorite kind.

20
00:06:45,035 --> 00:06:46,036
Why Daddy?

21
00:06:47,287 --> 00:06:48,163
Whatever does your mother do with you

22
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:50,165
when you're at home all day?

23
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:51,791
Oh she humors me.

24
00:06:52,751 --> 00:06:53,460
Dad.

25
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:54,294
Hmm?

26
00:06:54,377 --> 00:06:55,128
Customs are arriving.

27
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:56,046
Oh.

28
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:21,780
How lovely to see you.

29
00:07:21,863 --> 00:07:24,032
My goodness you get prettier every year.

30
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:26,493
Come below gentlemen,
I'll show you the papers.

31
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:30,997
It's wonderful to see you again.

32
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:32,082
Thank you.

33
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:35,210
Hello, how are you?

34
00:07:35,293 --> 00:07:36,211
Very well, thank you.

35
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:38,171
You have got longer since last year.

36
00:07:38,254 --> 00:07:39,005
Maybe.

37
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:40,215
He's getting fatter.

38
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:41,216
Hello Michael.

39
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,718
It's good to see you.

40
00:07:46,262 --> 00:07:48,181
Uh-oh I'm going to tell.

41
00:07:48,264 --> 00:07:49,557
Stop it.

42
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:50,850
Same old Milly.

43
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,021
First, thank you again
for the lovely time

44
00:07:55,105 --> 00:07:57,649
you gave me when I visited
you in London last year.

45
00:07:57,732 --> 00:08:00,360
Oh, that was my pleasure.

46
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:03,738
And now to see you all
again, it is smushing.

47
00:08:03,822 --> 00:08:04,906
Smushing.

48
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,616
Did you have a good
trip thus far this year?

49
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,617
Oh pretty straightforward.

50
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:08,618
We came down the Rhine.

51
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:10,912
Milly said you could
hear The Lorelei singing.

52
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:12,497
Then through Austria on the Danube.

53
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:15,291
Well everything seem to
be in order Mr. Stevenson.

54
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,126
Good.

55
00:08:16,209 --> 00:08:17,836
Now, have you anything to declare?

56
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,339
Oh just a little pipe tobacco.

57
00:08:21,464 --> 00:08:22,007
You?

58
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:22,841
No, nothing.

59
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:23,675
You?

60
00:08:23,758 --> 00:08:24,509
No, nothing.

61
00:08:24,592 --> 00:08:25,927
There is a man waiting to see you

62
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:27,303
on the bank Mr. Stevenson.

63
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:28,513
Oh?

64
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:30,640
I knew that character was watching us.

65
00:08:30,724 --> 00:08:33,268
You are welcome to go ashore
in our launch if you want.

66
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:34,978
Oh thank you, I'll just get my coat.

67
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:45,196
Oh Stevenson, oh my dear fella.

68
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,282
Thank heavens, you're a bit late you know.

69
00:08:47,365 --> 00:08:48,658
I'm Braithwaite from the Legation.

70
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:49,743
Braithwaite?

71
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:51,036
Yes, I missed you in Vienna

72
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:53,455
so we dashed over here with my...

73
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:58,293
Well the point is, we need
you in Budapest right away.

74
00:08:58,376 --> 00:08:59,461
What?

75
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:00,962
Yes, Ar-chep's gone sick.

76
00:09:01,046 --> 00:09:02,172
You've got to make the opening speech.

77
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:03,006
Look I...

78
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:04,424
Now don't, don't, don't,
don't worry, don't worry.

79
00:09:04,507 --> 00:09:05,592
You can always read his
speech if you get stuck.

80
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:07,218
But what about my family?

81
00:09:07,302 --> 00:09:09,596
Your fam, oh.

82
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:12,182
Well that's a bit of a snag isn't it?

83
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:14,601
Well most certainly,
they've got to come with me.

84
00:09:14,684 --> 00:09:15,602
What in the car?

85
00:09:17,228 --> 00:09:19,272
Well I hate to admit defeat old man, but...

86
00:09:21,816 --> 00:09:23,693
Look Dad, why don't I
take the boat to Budapest

87
00:09:23,777 --> 00:09:24,861
and meet you there?

88
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,742
Well if I must, I suppose I must.

89
00:09:30,825 --> 00:09:31,826
Oh that's my boy.

90
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,661
Now come along, come along now.

91
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:35,413
Oh but now look here, Milly
will have to come with me.

92
00:09:35,497 --> 00:09:37,207
She's too young to stay here by herself.

93
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,209
No, no, no, I want to go with Anne,

94
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:41,377
I don't want to go in the rotten old car.

95
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:43,213
Oh.

96
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:44,089
Now, stop that Milly.

97
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:45,381
I'm not gonna have to tell your mother

98
00:09:45,465 --> 00:09:47,133
that you've behaved badly.

99
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:48,718
Please Mr. Stevenson.

100
00:09:48,802 --> 00:09:51,054
We'll take real good care of her.

101
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:52,097
Please Daddy.

102
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,142
Oh all right.

103
00:09:56,226 --> 00:09:57,811
All right but now see
that you look after her.

104
00:09:57,894 --> 00:09:59,020
Now come along that's fine old boy.

105
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:00,605
Now we haven't got a moment
to spare, now come along.

106
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:01,815
Oh but look here, what about my gear?

107
00:10:01,898 --> 00:10:02,774
I must have a toothbrush.

108
00:10:02,857 --> 00:10:04,192
Oh don't worry, we'll get all that stuff

109
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:05,902
while you're at the Legation,
now you just hop in there.

110
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:07,570
Mm-hmm, that's fine now come along.

111
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:09,072
Come on Dad, in you go.

112
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:10,240
How do you suggest we do this?

113
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:13,201
Oh it's very simple, just
forward madame s'il vous plaÃ®t.

114
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:14,119
Eh, there.

115
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:16,329
There we are.

116
00:10:16,412 --> 00:10:17,872
OH dear.

117
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,499
Very nice.

118
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:21,709
Well good-bye.

119
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:22,627
Bye Dad, see you go.

120
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,087
Bye Dad.

121
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,255
Bye.

122
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:29,300
Come on, let's go.

123
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:37,559
Nothing to worry about, just
rely on Savoir Faire.

124
00:10:37,642 --> 00:10:39,978
I don't even know if I brought any.

125
00:10:40,061 --> 00:10:41,896
Fortunately I have enough for two.

126
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:45,984
As you were.

127
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,277
Passports please.

128
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:52,699
One American and one English huh.

129
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:55,785
Well we're not married right.

130
00:10:55,869 --> 00:10:56,953
Have you anything to declare?

131
00:10:57,036 --> 00:10:58,705
I'm glad you asked me that.

132
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:01,749
I want to declare that three
pair of socks was stolen.

133
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,501
No, no, that was in Austria.

134
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:04,335
He doesn't want to know that.

135
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:06,880
He wants to know if you have
any valuable merchandise,

136
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:09,048
gold, or precious stones?

137
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:11,217
No, not yet.

138
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:12,051
Shut up.

139
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:13,595
And you?

140
00:11:13,678 --> 00:11:16,306
I have only to declare my admiration

141
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:19,017
for the treasures of your country.

142
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,060
I should like to look in the caravan.

143
00:11:21,144 --> 00:11:21,978
All right.

144
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,033
Open this one please.

145
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:49,547
Well I thought I'd pick up
a few things in Budapest.

146
00:11:53,468 --> 00:11:54,093
Thank you sir.

147
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,975
Please, I hope you will
enjoy your stay in Hungary.

148
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:02,143
Thank you.

149
00:12:02,227 --> 00:12:03,937
As you were.

150
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:11,319
If somebody does not watch them,

151
00:12:11,402 --> 00:12:13,529
they will try to steal the Danube.

152
00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:15,531
I don't think you should have said that.

153
00:12:15,615 --> 00:12:18,284
I'm going to pick up a
few things in Budapest.

154
00:12:18,368 --> 00:12:20,328
Well, maybe I shouldn't have said it.

155
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:21,246
But I think we should.

156
00:12:21,329 --> 00:12:23,790
I mean we should steal something
just to keep in practice.

157
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:25,792
A few postage stamps or something.

158
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,628
Why do we always have
to steal an art object?

159
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:31,631
The trouble with you is that
you always think in pennies.

160
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:33,383
I think in millions.

161
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:36,052
You got a cigarette?

162
00:13:00,702 --> 00:13:01,786
Wait a minute.

163
00:13:05,456 --> 00:13:06,874
Michael and I are going to the ship stores

164
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,334
to get some supplies.

165
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:11,170
You Milly go down to the
market and get some bread.

166
00:13:11,254 --> 00:13:12,380
Get cracking.

167
00:13:12,463 --> 00:13:13,756
You men cracking.

168
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,590
Yes, cracking.

169
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:15,758
Crocking.

170
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,144
Yes.

171
00:13:27,312 --> 00:13:30,732
Smaller, smaller, for four people.

172
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:32,984
Four people.

173
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:33,901
Oh.

174
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,571
No, no, no, no.

175
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:44,078
Four people, 1/4.

176
00:13:45,621 --> 00:13:47,707
But I can't use all that bread.

177
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:50,168
Can I help you young lady?

178
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:51,711
Yes please.

179
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:55,048
How much bread do you want?

180
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:57,508
I only want a quarter
of that enormous loaf.

181
00:14:01,888 --> 00:14:03,639
Thank you, that was a great help.

182
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:05,516
Are you on holiday here?

183
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,435
No, we're going to Budapest in a boat.

184
00:14:07,518 --> 00:14:09,103
My father's going there by car,

185
00:14:09,187 --> 00:14:10,104
to a conference or something.

186
00:14:10,188 --> 00:14:11,939
And what have you come to see?

187
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,817
But I can't think of anything special.

188
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,194
But my brother likes to eat special

189
00:14:16,277 --> 00:14:17,820
because of the ice cream.

190
00:14:17,904 --> 00:14:20,531
Anne says there was some
nice things in the cathedral.

191
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:22,700
Would you like to see
something really special?

192
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:24,786
One of the most lovely things in Hungary.

193
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:27,246
And nobody else will be
able to see it today.

194
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,373
Something secret?

195
00:14:28,456 --> 00:14:29,207
Yeah.

196
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,166
Oh yes, please.

197
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,377
You must be one of the youngest visitors

198
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,962
Saint Laszlo ever had.

199
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:19,924
They clean it like this every year.

200
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:21,592
And it's a tradition that the cleaning

201
00:15:21,676 --> 00:15:24,554
shall always be done by the same family.

202
00:15:24,637 --> 00:15:27,640
His grandfather's grandfather
did this before him.

203
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:33,312
It's solid gold, this is
enamel and precious stones.

204
00:15:33,396 --> 00:15:35,314
It's a great treasure.

205
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:37,191
It's beautiful.

206
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:39,444
Now I really have got a secret.

207
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:41,112
Yes, yes. So.

208
00:15:42,738 --> 00:15:43,656
Thanks for letting me see it.

209
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,960
Quite a gem there isn't it?

210
00:17:19,043 --> 00:17:20,461
I know.

211
00:17:20,545 --> 00:17:21,837
What were you looking at there?

212
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:23,589
Saint Laszlo of course.

213
00:17:23,673 --> 00:17:25,633
Yes, he must be wonderful.

214
00:17:25,716 --> 00:17:29,303
He is, smashing all
that lovely gold hair

215
00:17:29,387 --> 00:17:31,389
and all those rich jewels.

216
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:33,224
You seem to know quite
a lot about Saint Laszlo.

217
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:35,977
He's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

218
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,981
When, how could you have seen him?

219
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:41,691
It was a very special favor.

220
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:44,735
I'm the only one who
seem him today actually.

221
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:48,447
Today, no you must be wrong my dear.

222
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:49,407
He isn't here today.

223
00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:51,576
I know, they're cleaning it.

224
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:53,119
The same family do it,

225
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:55,580
they've been doing it for ever and ever.

226
00:17:55,663 --> 00:17:58,124
You think they'd show
it to me if I ask nicely?

227
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:01,294
They might.

228
00:18:02,753 --> 00:18:05,131
You're sure you're not imagining all this?

229
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:07,216
I'll jolly well show
you, the house I mean,

230
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,010
not him 'cause that's a secret.

231
00:18:09,885 --> 00:18:12,597
All right, but I still can't believe it.

232
00:18:12,722 --> 00:18:13,889
Come on, I'll show you.

233
00:18:13,973 --> 00:18:16,392
We have to be very quick,
my brother's waiting for me.

234
00:18:16,475 --> 00:18:17,310
All right.

235
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:23,149
We must hurry, they'll be
waiting for me at the boat.

236
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:23,983
A boat.

237
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:27,320
The White Rabbit, we're
on our way to Budapest.

238
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:28,446
Oh.

239
00:18:28,529 --> 00:18:30,948
It's there, yellow
house with the green door.

240
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:31,866
I see.

241
00:18:31,949 --> 00:18:34,118
Good-bye, remember it's a secret.

242
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:36,078
I will, okay, bye.

243
00:19:07,818 --> 00:19:10,446
The men say they
are very sorry Michael,

244
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:12,740
but we must return to town.

245
00:19:12,823 --> 00:19:14,492
The chief of police wants to ask us

246
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:16,702
some questions about something.

247
00:19:16,786 --> 00:19:18,621
He especially wants to talk to Milly.

248
00:19:20,498 --> 00:19:24,794
Me, oh dear I bet it's
about daddy's tobacco tins.

249
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:25,920
Yes, that could be.

250
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:30,466
This way please.

251
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:40,142
Yes, that's the little girl.

252
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,938
I'm afraid something rather
serious has happened.

253
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:47,233
You remember the golden
head, it's been stolen.

254
00:19:47,316 --> 00:19:50,569
Stolen, it can't be,
who'd do such a thing?

255
00:19:50,695 --> 00:19:51,737
Apart from myself,

256
00:19:51,821 --> 00:19:54,532
you are the only one who saw it yesterday.

257
00:19:54,615 --> 00:19:56,450
How dreadful.

258
00:19:56,534 --> 00:19:59,537
Did you tell anybody
about seeing the head?

259
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,706
I started to tell Harold.

260
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:03,791
I thought she was making it up as usual.

261
00:20:03,874 --> 00:20:04,875
I knew she had a secret,

262
00:20:04,959 --> 00:20:07,128
but I never dreamed it
was anything like this.

263
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:10,172
You are the oldest one, no?

264
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:11,090
Yes sir.

265
00:20:16,178 --> 00:20:18,305
Can you explain this?

266
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:19,515
That's ours.

267
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:22,435
The White Rabbit is your boat isn't it?

268
00:20:22,518 --> 00:20:23,519
Yes sir.

269
00:20:23,602 --> 00:20:26,772
This tool was used
to break into the house

270
00:20:26,856 --> 00:20:28,524
and then left behind.

271
00:20:30,151 --> 00:20:31,736
But that's incredible.

272
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:34,613
Perhaps you took it as a joke.

273
00:20:34,697 --> 00:20:36,866
Certainly not.

274
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:40,578
Our dad's a detective, we
would never be so stupid.

275
00:20:40,661 --> 00:20:42,663
Fancy anybody leaving direct evidence

276
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:44,206
on the scene of the crime like that.

277
00:20:44,331 --> 00:20:47,501
It's a put up job, but
how did they get our hammer?

278
00:20:47,585 --> 00:20:50,129
My father's at the police
conference in Budapest,

279
00:20:50,212 --> 00:20:51,505
he'll tell you that we don't normally

280
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:53,841
go around committing burglaries.

281
00:20:56,177 --> 00:21:01,140
You say that somebody
stole this and then the head?

282
00:21:01,432 --> 00:21:03,100
Well it's the only explanation.

283
00:21:05,811 --> 00:21:08,397
Think hard, you must have told

284
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:10,608
somebody about the head.

285
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:12,610
No, I would have remembered.

286
00:21:13,527 --> 00:21:14,278
Uh-oh.

287
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:15,321
Yes.

288
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,490
There was a man in the
cathedral, he was English.

289
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:18,949
I showed him the house.

290
00:21:19,033 --> 00:21:20,576
Can you describe him?

291
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:24,830
Could I be of help?

292
00:21:24,914 --> 00:21:26,123
That's him.

293
00:21:26,248 --> 00:21:28,709
Mr. Palmer, the
London antique dealer aren't you?

294
00:21:28,793 --> 00:21:29,543
Yes,

295
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:30,836
Allow me to introduce
you to the chief of police.

296
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,046
How do you do?

297
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:34,256
What a tragedy Father, what a tragedy.

298
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,801
It is him, I showed him the house.

299
00:21:36,884 --> 00:21:39,428
Is this young lady in
some sort of trouble?

300
00:21:39,512 --> 00:21:41,096
It's very embarrassing Mr. Palmer,

301
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,015
but she said she showed you where the head

302
00:21:43,098 --> 00:21:44,600
of Saint Laszlo was
being cleaned yesterday.

303
00:21:45,518 --> 00:21:46,936
What nonsense, I've never seen

304
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:48,687
this little girl before in my life.

305
00:21:48,771 --> 00:21:50,815
You're telling stories my dear.

306
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:53,317
It's not true, it's
not true, I did show you.

307
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,153
You must believe me,
really I did show him.

308
00:21:56,278 --> 00:21:58,989
Now this is preposterous,
I insist upon my car

309
00:21:59,073 --> 00:22:01,158
and my hotel room being searched.

310
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:05,120
Thank you Mr. Palmer,
I'm being forced to ask you

311
00:22:05,204 --> 00:22:07,832
to do that after what the child says.

312
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:08,749
Naturally.

313
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,377
You know if your mommy
and daddy were here,

314
00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:14,088
I'd have something to say
about your upbringing.

315
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:17,675
You were at one of those
progressive schools no doubt.

316
00:22:18,592 --> 00:22:19,552
Excuse me sir.

317
00:22:19,635 --> 00:22:21,470
Oh Mr. Palmer.

318
00:22:21,554 --> 00:22:24,974
My father's in Budapest,
but perhaps if you care

319
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:27,560
to leave me your card, if
an apology is called for

320
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:28,811
you'll certainly get one.

321
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:29,979
That's fair enough.

322
00:22:31,689 --> 00:22:32,523
Thank you.

323
00:22:36,151 --> 00:22:37,486
Surely you believe me.

324
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:40,906
My child, I
don't know what to think.

325
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,825
Except that you must be mistaken.

326
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:49,498
There, there, it'll be all right.

327
00:23:12,313 --> 00:23:13,564
Have they gone?

328
00:23:13,647 --> 00:23:14,481
Yes.

329
00:23:14,565 --> 00:23:17,026
The police, they're
the same the world over.

330
00:23:17,109 --> 00:23:19,528
Mm-mm, now you may assume

331
00:23:19,612 --> 00:23:21,655
that all police are fools, but I don't.

332
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:25,284
I think I was right to
take the bull by the horns.

333
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:26,327
To grab the cup.

334
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,745
No, no, that's just an expression,

335
00:23:27,828 --> 00:23:30,247
meaning that it was wise to
go to the police station,

336
00:23:30,331 --> 00:23:31,498
now you've got that?

337
00:23:31,582 --> 00:23:32,374
Yes.

338
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:33,709
But what did I say?

339
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:34,627
When?

340
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:40,591
Look, do you remember
that job that we did

341
00:23:40,674 --> 00:23:42,259
in Bogno in 1950?

342
00:23:42,343 --> 00:23:43,093
Yes.

343
00:23:43,177 --> 00:23:46,680
Hmm, well we're not
gonna do it that way.

344
00:23:46,764 --> 00:23:47,598
Oh.

345
00:23:48,933 --> 00:23:52,186
Now, what is the obvious thing to do?

346
00:23:53,312 --> 00:23:56,482
Now, what is the obvious thing to do?

347
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:58,651
I just said that, do you know?

348
00:23:59,902 --> 00:24:01,612
Yeah, the obvious
thing to do is something

349
00:24:01,695 --> 00:24:05,199
that's so obvious that
nobody even suspects that.

350
00:24:05,282 --> 00:24:07,910
So we'll get us a jet plane with the...

351
00:24:07,993 --> 00:24:08,827
No.

352
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:12,539
A truck, a refrigerator
truck with plenty of ice.

353
00:24:12,623 --> 00:24:13,499
No.

354
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:14,583
No ice.

355
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,794
No truck, no.

356
00:24:16,877 --> 00:24:18,629
Well, what if we got...

357
00:24:18,712 --> 00:24:20,714
No, no, I'll tell you
what we're gonna do.

358
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:22,758
We'll make it invisible.

359
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,636
What?

360
00:24:27,554 --> 00:24:28,973
The thing.

361
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:32,101
What thing?

362
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:34,061
The object.

363
00:24:34,144 --> 00:24:35,771
What object?

364
00:24:35,854 --> 00:24:37,189
Oh you know what.

365
00:24:37,272 --> 00:24:38,816
No, I don't.

366
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:39,692
The head.

367
00:24:39,775 --> 00:24:42,027
Oh the golden head, yeah!

368
00:24:44,571 --> 00:24:48,200
Now look, I'll explain it to you

369
00:24:48,283 --> 00:24:49,451
in words of one syllable.

370
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:52,037
Aww there's no need to be insulting.

371
00:24:52,121 --> 00:24:53,455
Now look, what we're going to do,

372
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:56,667
yes, we're going to pull
the old double bluff.

373
00:24:58,002 --> 00:24:59,461
The old double bluff.

374
00:24:59,545 --> 00:25:00,379
Yeah.

375
00:25:00,462 --> 00:25:03,841
What is the old double
bluff, what's that?

376
00:25:03,924 --> 00:25:04,925
Well you see those kids on the boat

377
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:06,510
are in so much trouble already,

378
00:25:06,593 --> 00:25:09,722
all we've got to do is to dig
them in a little bit deeper

379
00:25:09,805 --> 00:25:10,806
then the police will never believe

380
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:12,224
anything they say at anytime.

381
00:25:13,183 --> 00:25:15,602
That's genius, well
you travel with a genius

382
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:17,271
who just keeps geniusing.

383
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:24,486
There's a fly in the coffee.

384
00:25:26,822 --> 00:25:29,658
The main questions
that came to our concern

385
00:25:29,742 --> 00:25:32,411
gentlemen are the following.

386
00:25:32,494 --> 00:25:35,873
Firstly to intensify
the service provided by

387
00:25:35,956 --> 00:25:38,500
the Central International Crime Bureau

388
00:25:38,584 --> 00:25:39,960
so that it will be possible,

389
00:25:40,044 --> 00:25:42,504
not only to furnish any
country requesting it,

390
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:45,049
with visual data and by radio,

391
00:25:45,132 --> 00:25:49,136
such as photographs and
fingerprints of wanted criminals,

392
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:50,471
but also to follow this up

393
00:25:50,554 --> 00:25:54,725
with a detailed dossier on microfilm.

394
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:58,729
Secondly to clarify the
extradition procedure

395
00:25:58,812 --> 00:26:02,733
on criminals who abscond from
one country into another.

396
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:07,029
We will be pooling information on a

397
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:08,322
- series of armed robberies.
- Don't bother us now,

398
00:26:08,405 --> 00:26:10,074
he's speaking, yes.

399
00:26:10,157 --> 00:26:12,743
- Similar in outline.
- Oh can't it wait?

400
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:14,703
Which have effected most of us here at

401
00:26:14,787 --> 00:26:16,413
- one time or another.
- Well if it's that urgent.

402
00:26:16,497 --> 00:26:17,748
And which may well...

403
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:19,166
Sorry young man, it's urgent.

404
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:22,127
Oh, okay, yes.

405
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:25,672
Hello, I think he's on the line.

406
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,925
Hello Daddy, is that you?

407
00:26:28,884 --> 00:26:31,887
Milly, you've chosen rather
an awkward moment darling.

408
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:36,100
Can I ring you back, I'm making a speech.

409
00:26:36,225 --> 00:26:38,936
But this is really
important, you must listen.

410
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:40,270
It's about a crook.

411
00:26:40,354 --> 00:26:43,982
He's stolen the golden
head, have you got a pencil?

412
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:45,651
Oh all right, but give me it quick,

413
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:47,277
then get off the line will you?

414
00:26:48,821 --> 00:26:52,157
Palmer, P-A-L-M-E-R,

415
00:26:52,241 --> 00:26:55,702
antique dealer, 99-99-Saint James.

416
00:26:55,828 --> 00:26:59,915
Yes, all right now,
will you ring off please?

417
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,167
But how will you let us know?

418
00:27:02,251 --> 00:27:04,211
I'll send you a wire to...

419
00:27:04,294 --> 00:27:05,462
Esztergom.

420
00:27:05,546 --> 00:27:07,589
Esztergom, right goodbye.

421
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:13,637
My apologies gentlemen, a slight crisis.

422
00:27:14,638 --> 00:27:16,557
And now to return to the more serious

423
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,226
business of catching criminals.

424
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:21,061
I don't think Daddy was very pleased.

425
00:27:21,145 --> 00:27:23,522
Dad will let us know if
Palmer's a crook or not,

426
00:27:23,605 --> 00:27:25,732
we just have to wait and be patient.

427
00:27:36,618 --> 00:27:39,705
These four paintings are very famous.

428
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:43,959
They are at least four or 500 years old.

429
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:46,295
The artist is unknown.

430
00:27:46,378 --> 00:27:50,716
In place of his signature he
only used his initials, M.S.

431
00:28:17,784 --> 00:28:19,494
Shall we move on then?

432
00:28:52,736 --> 00:28:55,447
# If I wasn't shy #

433
00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:00,202
# I would look in your eye #

434
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:05,290
# And I would find the
way to say the things #

435
00:29:05,499 --> 00:29:08,001
# I'd like to say #

436
00:29:08,085 --> 00:29:11,505
# Some things that I feel #

437
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:15,759
# I can't never reveal #

438
00:29:15,842 --> 00:29:20,847
# I wish I knew the way to say
the things I'd like to say #

439
00:29:24,226 --> 00:29:29,231
# But how can I ask you to be mine #

440
00:29:31,858 --> 00:29:36,613
# I guess I will have to take my time #

441
00:29:39,366 --> 00:29:43,829
# Sweet words in my heart #

442
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:47,708
# Tell me, where do I start #

443
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:52,796
# I only hope perhaps one day #

444
00:29:54,756 --> 00:29:59,761
# I'll say the little
things I'd like to say #

445
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,684
That was very nice Michael, I liked it.

446
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,043
It's him Palmer, with another man.

447
00:30:41,845 --> 00:30:43,263
What are they up to?

448
00:30:43,347 --> 00:30:45,265
It's his accomplice, they
always have an accomplice.

449
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:47,851
I bet that's why they
didn't mind being searched.

450
00:30:48,935 --> 00:30:50,937
What a stroke of luck them stopping him.

451
00:30:51,021 --> 00:30:52,189
Now we can watch them.

452
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:54,066
Maybe they've got the
golden head in there.

453
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:55,567
Gosh, do you really think so?

454
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,194
We could catch 'em red handed.

455
00:30:57,277 --> 00:30:58,612
Then Daddy wouldn't disown us.

456
00:30:58,695 --> 00:31:00,739
He may even get promoted because of this.

457
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,624
Now's our chance, let's tell the others.

458
00:31:10,707 --> 00:31:12,542
No, Michael would never agree.

459
00:31:12,626 --> 00:31:13,835
It's up to us, are you with me?

460
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:14,878
Of course.

461
00:31:24,596 --> 00:31:25,680
We thought we'd
go for a little stroll.

462
00:31:25,764 --> 00:31:27,641
Don't go to far away.

463
00:31:27,724 --> 00:31:28,725
We won't.

464
00:31:30,352 --> 00:31:31,311
Milly?

465
00:31:31,395 --> 00:31:32,145
Yes?

466
00:31:32,229 --> 00:31:33,647
Don't you go
getting into any more scrapes.

467
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,399
All right.

468
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:01,925
You want to go inside?

469
00:32:02,008 --> 00:32:02,843
Of course.

470
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,801
It's in there, I saw it.

471
00:32:48,346 --> 00:32:49,181
Come on.

472
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,563
Michael!

473
00:32:56,646 --> 00:32:57,481
What?

474
00:32:58,607 --> 00:33:00,317
It's there in Palmer's caravan.

475
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,610
He's got it, he really has.

476
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:02,903
Not the golden head.

477
00:33:02,986 --> 00:33:04,488
Yes, Milly saw it in the cabin.

478
00:33:04,571 --> 00:33:06,490
You'd better be right this time.

479
00:33:15,582 --> 00:33:16,666
Good evening.

480
00:33:20,295 --> 00:33:21,254
Oh, come in.

481
00:33:33,016 --> 00:33:33,934
In there.

482
00:33:39,523 --> 00:33:40,899
But I saw it, I know it was there.

483
00:33:40,982 --> 00:33:42,984
They must have moved it.

484
00:33:51,993 --> 00:33:53,203
Oh, there's nothing here.

485
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:10,971
Now if you're quite satisfied,

486
00:34:11,054 --> 00:34:12,472
perhaps you wouldn't
mind leaving us alone.

487
00:34:12,556 --> 00:34:14,349
My friend here is tired.

488
00:34:19,104 --> 00:34:20,438
Pardon.

489
00:34:20,522 --> 00:34:23,525
But it's true, they're so true.

490
00:34:23,608 --> 00:34:26,778
Young man, I hold you
responsible for this.

491
00:34:26,861 --> 00:34:28,488
You realize that if I wanted to get nasty

492
00:34:28,572 --> 00:34:30,448
I could go to the Legation.

493
00:34:30,532 --> 00:34:33,285
I think that an apology
is called for, don't you?

494
00:34:33,368 --> 00:34:36,621
Yes sir, I apologize sir.

495
00:34:36,705 --> 00:34:38,123
Thank you very much.

496
00:34:39,332 --> 00:34:41,376
Nice kid, that kid.

497
00:34:42,294 --> 00:34:43,420
Get it back out again.

498
00:34:43,503 --> 00:34:44,337
Why.

499
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,342
Well we might as well admit it,

500
00:34:49,426 --> 00:34:51,970
they're not crooks and we
made that whole thing up.

501
00:34:52,971 --> 00:34:56,099
On the contrary I'm
convinced they are crooks.

502
00:34:56,182 --> 00:34:59,060
The man with him looked
about as straight as a pretzel.

503
00:34:59,144 --> 00:35:01,730
Yeah.

504
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:04,649
You know Dad's book on
how to catch a criminal?

505
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:05,567
Yes.

506
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,986
Well just add a little
deduction as it says.

507
00:35:08,945 --> 00:35:12,449
Now then, why would they
park right beside us?

508
00:35:12,532 --> 00:35:15,160
Because they wanted to be searched.

509
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:16,745
Why should they want that?

510
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:18,121
To make us look foolish.

511
00:35:18,204 --> 00:35:20,624
Now our accusations seem worthless.

512
00:35:20,707 --> 00:35:22,709
Why should they want that?

513
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:24,336
Because they are guilty.

514
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:27,297
That's it, you were
right Milly old girl,

515
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,258
and I'm proud of you.

516
00:35:30,342 --> 00:35:31,343
You'd better have a look in Dad's books,

517
00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:32,552
see what else it says.

518
00:35:32,636 --> 00:35:33,345
Yes.

519
00:35:37,057 --> 00:35:38,099
Have you ever heard of anyone

520
00:35:38,183 --> 00:35:40,310
needing a life preserver on the Danube?

521
00:35:40,393 --> 00:35:42,687
I never even heard of the Danube.

522
00:35:43,563 --> 00:35:45,065
You know we've been very successful

523
00:35:45,148 --> 00:35:47,067
in our operation so far.

524
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,652
But with every policeman in the country

525
00:35:48,735 --> 00:35:51,488
looking for what we've got.

526
00:35:51,571 --> 00:35:53,239
What do we got?

527
00:35:54,658 --> 00:35:55,575
The thing.

528
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:56,451
What thing.

529
00:35:58,328 --> 00:35:59,454
The object.

530
00:35:59,537 --> 00:36:00,413
What object?

531
00:36:01,915 --> 00:36:03,458
The you know what?

532
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:07,379
Oh the, yeah I know that,
I'm not stupid you know.

533
00:36:07,462 --> 00:36:08,546
Well I think we ought
to put it somewhere

534
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,633
where no one will ever
think of looking for it.

535
00:36:11,716 --> 00:36:13,760
Put it right at the bottom of the river.

536
00:36:13,843 --> 00:36:17,138
Mm-hmm, and then we wouldn't
be able to find it ourselves.

537
00:36:17,222 --> 00:36:18,973
That's right.

538
00:36:19,057 --> 00:36:21,851
Now let's put it in
the life preserver locker

539
00:36:21,935 --> 00:36:23,061
on The White Rabbit.

540
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,147
Basil, that's beautiful.

541
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:26,981
Yeah.

542
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:29,025
That's why you're a
genius, that's genius.

543
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:30,735
That's what I thought.

544
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:32,112
Well see if you could find

545
00:36:32,195 --> 00:36:34,239
an old piece of canvas and wrap it up.

546
00:36:34,322 --> 00:36:35,615
Wrap what up?

547
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:38,243
Oh the, the...

548
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:39,661
Mm-hmm, yeah.

549
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:40,578
I know what.

550
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,583
I hope that boat floats.

551
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:47,502
I don't feel like going
in that cold water.

552
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:49,587
I thought you told me
you went to prep school.

553
00:36:49,671 --> 00:36:51,256
Yeah, what's that got to do with it?

554
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:53,508
Well didn't you take
a cold shower every day?

555
00:36:53,591 --> 00:36:55,218
Every day, twice on the weekends.

556
00:36:55,301 --> 00:36:56,803
Then you should be used to cold water.

557
00:36:56,886 --> 00:36:59,055
Well we didn't take cold
showers to get used to the water,

558
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:02,225
we took 'em to take our mind off things.

559
00:37:02,308 --> 00:37:03,768
What things?

560
00:37:03,852 --> 00:37:06,187
Well you know, girls.

561
00:37:06,271 --> 00:37:07,605
Well why do you want

562
00:37:07,689 --> 00:37:09,482
to take your mind off girls for?

563
00:37:09,566 --> 00:37:10,316
I didn't.

564
00:37:11,818 --> 00:37:12,694
You know that here in Hungary

565
00:37:12,777 --> 00:37:15,155
they take hot showers together.

566
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:18,116
Together?

567
00:39:11,437 --> 00:39:13,857
No, nothing.

568
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,692
There should be some word.

569
00:39:15,775 --> 00:39:17,193
She said no.

570
00:39:17,277 --> 00:39:19,070
What now Sherlock Holmes?

571
00:39:19,904 --> 00:39:20,989
Let's telephone Daddy again.

572
00:39:21,072 --> 00:39:24,158
After all we know what a crook
Palmer is and daddy doesn't.

573
00:39:25,285 --> 00:39:26,619
Okay, let's go.

574
00:39:28,913 --> 00:39:31,040
Now this is the
only authentic photograph

575
00:39:31,124 --> 00:39:35,837
we have of the international
art thief, Basil Peale.

576
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,464
He usually passes himself off as a major.

577
00:39:38,548 --> 00:39:41,426
In fact, he never rose
above the rank of last call.

578
00:39:42,844 --> 00:39:47,307
We do have photographs
of a pair of criminals

579
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:50,560
who's record is similar to Peale's.

580
00:39:50,643 --> 00:39:52,729
My government is seeking
a man who goes by the name

581
00:39:52,812 --> 00:39:54,147
of Sat-yed Palmer.

582
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,190
He stole the Perseid Idol Of Yar-Har

583
00:39:56,274 --> 00:39:58,067
in a daringly executed coup

584
00:39:58,151 --> 00:40:01,905
and he has upset the entire
female population of my country.

585
00:40:01,988 --> 00:40:03,698
This is the photograph.

586
00:40:04,616 --> 00:40:06,826
Until the Perseid Idol is recovered,

587
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,454
no marriages may take place in Yorhar.

588
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,249
So if you gentleman would
please treat this affair

589
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:14,918
with the utmost urgency.

590
00:40:17,253 --> 00:40:19,172
The gentleman in our picture is...

591
00:40:21,257 --> 00:40:25,678
who attempted to steal
Schubert's unfinished Symphony.

592
00:40:25,762 --> 00:40:26,596
Photo.

593
00:40:27,889 --> 00:40:31,142
Fortunately we foiled
him while he was looking

594
00:40:31,225 --> 00:40:32,810
for the rest of the score.

595
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:39,359
Hello?

596
00:40:39,442 --> 00:40:41,653
Long distance
call for Mr. Stevenson.

597
00:40:41,736 --> 00:40:43,529
Well if it's a personal
call I can't take it.

598
00:40:43,613 --> 00:40:44,364
The call sir.

599
00:40:44,447 --> 00:40:46,074
No, no, no, I won't accept the call.

600
00:40:46,157 --> 00:40:48,284
Daddy, hello, hello Daddy.

601
00:40:48,368 --> 00:40:50,536
Milly, ring off at once.

602
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,789
I don't want any more calls from you

603
00:40:52,872 --> 00:40:54,666
until you get to Budapest, you hear.

604
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:58,086
Dad, Mike, look this is an emergency.

605
00:40:58,169 --> 00:40:59,253
Did you send a cable?

606
00:40:59,379 --> 00:41:00,922
What cable?

607
00:41:01,005 --> 00:41:03,132
About Palmer.

608
00:41:03,216 --> 00:41:04,926
What are you talking about?

609
00:41:05,051 --> 00:41:07,762
He hasn't done anything yet.

610
00:41:07,845 --> 00:41:08,972
This is going to be up to us.

611
00:41:09,097 --> 00:41:11,432
Michael, are you, is
everything all right?

612
00:41:11,516 --> 00:41:13,810
Yes, we're fine thanks.

613
00:41:13,935 --> 00:41:17,271
Then don't bother me anymore
Michael please, goodbye.

614
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,444
Is the canvas is stolen
by these two men include a

615
00:41:23,528 --> 00:41:26,906
Dufy, a de Toulouse-Lautrec, a Gauguin,

616
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:30,410
a van Gogh, a Chagall, and a 90 castles.

617
00:41:32,161 --> 00:41:34,038
What now mastermind?

618
00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:36,207
Perhaps we ought to go to the police?

619
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:37,041
No.

620
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:38,251
No, we'll make our own inquiries.

621
00:41:38,334 --> 00:41:39,460
We'll send a cable.

622
00:41:39,544 --> 00:41:40,670
That's a good idea.

623
00:41:40,753 --> 00:41:42,755
Who is the cable to, Scotland Yard?

624
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:44,590
No, our own investigator.

625
00:41:44,674 --> 00:41:46,217
We'll find out if Palmer really does

626
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,969
have a shop in Saint James.

627
00:41:48,052 --> 00:41:49,303
We'll case the joint.

628
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:52,932
Who is this super
intelligent investigator?

629
00:41:53,016 --> 00:41:54,308
The Honorable Augustus.

630
00:41:54,392 --> 00:41:55,685
Who?

631
00:41:55,768 --> 00:41:58,896
Why the Honorable
Augustus Pilkington Smythe.

632
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,606
He's got the highest intelligence rating

633
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,774
in the whole of London.

634
00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:02,942
Who says so?

635
00:42:03,026 --> 00:42:04,277
He does.

636
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,404
Come on, let's get to the cable office.

637
00:42:09,115 --> 00:42:10,867
Come in.

638
00:42:15,705 --> 00:42:16,748
Good morning sir.

639
00:42:16,831 --> 00:42:18,750
Good morning Stanley.

640
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:22,170
A telegram has arrived
for you sir, from Budapest.

641
00:42:22,253 --> 00:42:24,130
You've been reading
my mail again Stanley.

642
00:42:24,213 --> 00:42:25,256
Certainly not sir.

643
00:42:25,339 --> 00:42:27,800
Then how did you know
it came from Budapest?

644
00:42:27,884 --> 00:42:30,053
It smells of paprika sir.

645
00:42:30,178 --> 00:42:32,513
Hmm, you want to have a little joke.

646
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:35,558
Hmm, get me the Rolls.

647
00:42:35,641 --> 00:42:38,186
I fear his lordship is using it sir.

648
00:42:38,269 --> 00:42:39,604
Then get me the Bentley.

649
00:42:39,687 --> 00:42:42,356
Our ladyship has taken it to town.

650
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,276
May I offer you my Ferrari sir?

651
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,194
Who's driving?

652
00:42:46,277 --> 00:42:48,154
Me naturally.

653
00:42:48,237 --> 00:42:50,823
No thank you, get me a taxi.

654
00:42:50,907 --> 00:42:52,658
Very well sir, right away.

655
00:42:52,742 --> 00:42:54,327
After I finish my breakfast.

656
00:43:06,464 --> 00:43:08,466
You sure you got that number right pal?

657
00:43:08,549 --> 00:43:09,967
I mean we've been up and down this street

658
00:43:10,051 --> 00:43:13,596
three times already, I
can't see no number 99.

659
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:14,889
I really don't understand it.

660
00:43:14,972 --> 00:43:17,683
There must be a 99 somewhere.

661
00:43:17,767 --> 00:43:19,477
Well there's one next
door to me in Beckham,

662
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,437
but it's a certainty there ain't one here.

663
00:43:21,521 --> 00:43:22,522
Fluid kids.

664
00:43:22,605 --> 00:43:25,066
I'm not fluid kids as
you choose to call it.

665
00:43:25,149 --> 00:43:27,193
My name is Pilkington Smythe.

666
00:43:27,276 --> 00:43:28,945
I'm sure there's a 99 somewhere.

667
00:43:29,028 --> 00:43:32,406
Pilkington Smythe,
ha is it your name huh?

668
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:33,616
Yes.

669
00:43:34,909 --> 00:43:37,703
Pilkington Smythe, well
that's so cute at that.

670
00:43:37,787 --> 00:43:39,247
Right, your lordship.

671
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:41,124
You want to settle the fare now

672
00:43:41,207 --> 00:43:42,875
or are we gonna go on missing the bar?

673
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:45,920
I'm not your lordship
as yet, only an honorable.

674
00:43:46,003 --> 00:43:48,381
Kindly wait me while I ask somebody.

675
00:43:48,464 --> 00:43:49,966
The full leave you are.

676
00:43:54,095 --> 00:43:54,846
Hey, I said,

677
00:43:54,929 --> 00:43:57,181
can you tell me where number 99 is?

678
00:43:57,265 --> 00:43:59,142
Scram kid, I
ain't supposed to talk.

679
00:44:00,685 --> 00:44:02,103
Try a telephone directory.

680
00:44:02,186 --> 00:44:03,563
Excellent idea, thank you.

681
00:44:12,113 --> 00:44:13,823
I shan't be very long, please wait.

682
00:44:13,906 --> 00:44:16,951
All right, all right,
it's mighty times for me,

683
00:44:17,034 --> 00:44:19,078
put your foot on the meter now.

684
00:44:19,162 --> 00:44:20,329
Oh I'll pay.

685
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:27,044
This is dog waiting mad,
the little monster about.

686
00:44:27,128 --> 00:44:28,629
I'll be broke too.

687
00:44:30,006 --> 00:44:32,383
Kindly embarrassing, I forgot my wallet.

688
00:44:32,466 --> 00:44:34,051
Would you mind lending me a pound please?

689
00:44:34,177 --> 00:44:36,429
I'll pay it back when I get home.

690
00:44:36,512 --> 00:44:37,847
I knew it, I knew it,

691
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:39,348
he's putting the bite on me.

692
00:44:39,473 --> 00:44:43,269
I have a rather expensive
cable to send, it's most urgent.

693
00:44:43,352 --> 00:44:44,562
The first time I've ever been conned

694
00:44:44,645 --> 00:44:46,397
by a member of the nobility.

695
00:44:48,149 --> 00:44:49,817
It don't make it any better, here.

696
00:44:49,942 --> 00:44:52,445
I'll be eternally grateful old chap.

697
00:44:52,528 --> 00:44:54,238
Get on with it.

698
00:45:02,872 --> 00:45:04,373
Would you read it back to me?

699
00:45:07,418 --> 00:45:09,754
We really don't need
quite so many words do we?

700
00:45:09,837 --> 00:45:13,674
Surely we can allow ourselves
just a little telegraphese.

701
00:45:13,758 --> 00:45:16,636
Certainly not madame, this
telegram is going abroad.

702
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:19,972
So it would be unpardonable to
butcher the Queen's English.

703
00:45:20,056 --> 00:45:22,475
Very well, as you wish.

704
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:25,353
I'm sick and tired of that boat,

705
00:45:25,436 --> 00:45:27,188
this is worse than going to a funeral.

706
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:28,189
You're a sticker bomb,

707
00:45:28,272 --> 00:45:30,399
this is a kind of holiday.

708
00:45:30,483 --> 00:45:35,112
Lovely sunshine, beautiful
country, remember Rio de Janeiro?

709
00:45:35,196 --> 00:45:36,781
Oh yeah, Delores.

710
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:40,201
Forget Delores.

711
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:42,161
Oh yeah, Delores, oh I've...

712
00:45:44,538 --> 00:45:47,708
They're still following
us, I wonder why?

713
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:49,752
They're just curious I guess.

714
00:45:49,835 --> 00:45:51,170
You'd think we got the golden head

715
00:45:51,254 --> 00:45:52,755
the way they are following us.

716
00:46:03,391 --> 00:46:05,184
That's no good, you're too far away.

717
00:46:05,268 --> 00:46:06,477
Uh-huh.

718
00:46:06,602 --> 00:46:08,729
What we need is a close up photograph.

719
00:46:09,563 --> 00:46:12,108
I see, well how do
you suggest we do that?

720
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:16,112
Well we'll go to an Express
Soup Cafe in the next town.

721
00:46:16,195 --> 00:46:18,239
They'll follow us and it'll be a cinch.

722
00:46:18,322 --> 00:46:20,199
Milly, you know what you are?

723
00:46:20,283 --> 00:46:21,826
You're a mastermind.

724
00:46:25,246 --> 00:46:27,123
Anne is taking a long time.

725
00:46:27,206 --> 00:46:27,999
Well what she's trying to do

726
00:46:28,082 --> 00:46:30,167
is a little difficult to organize.

727
00:46:30,251 --> 00:46:31,294
Here she comes.

728
00:46:37,717 --> 00:46:40,052
Watch out for the
man with the red scarf.

729
00:47:19,258 --> 00:47:21,177
Smashing.

730
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,011
Very good.

731
00:47:22,094 --> 00:47:24,472
Great, just what we needed.

732
00:47:26,098 --> 00:47:27,516
How many please?

733
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,311
About a dozen, and we'll
hang on to the negative.

734
00:47:33,356 --> 00:47:34,231
That's funny.

735
00:47:38,027 --> 00:47:39,403
What's funny?

736
00:47:39,528 --> 00:47:42,239
Oh nothing, I'm probably
imagining things again.

737
00:47:43,407 --> 00:47:45,785
We will send the memo to
Guff, he's got contacts

738
00:47:45,868 --> 00:47:48,454
in Scotland Yard as
well as everywhere else.

739
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:59,673
Okay, we follow them
into Budapest, then what?

740
00:47:59,757 --> 00:48:01,717
Well we'll check the
boat from time to time

741
00:48:01,801 --> 00:48:04,011
until they leave, then we'll follow them

742
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,597
to Austria and collect our you know what.

743
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,316
Hey, they can't do that,
where are they going?

744
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,567
What a rotten trick.

745
00:48:18,651 --> 00:48:21,153
I thought you said the
road followed the river.

746
00:48:21,237 --> 00:48:23,823
It does, but only on the map.

747
00:48:23,906 --> 00:48:26,700
See they built, I don't know.

748
00:48:47,847 --> 00:48:49,306
Hey, hey, hey.

749
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:51,267
Oh welcome.

750
00:48:53,811 --> 00:48:55,563
You're in good hands.

751
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,399
Today everybody's our guest.

752
00:48:58,482 --> 00:49:00,651
Come to the wedding.

753
00:49:00,734 --> 00:49:02,236
We're invited to a wedding.

754
00:49:03,571 --> 00:49:05,698
The prettiest girl in
Hungary will be married.

755
00:49:05,781 --> 00:49:07,366
I'm the best man.

756
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:08,617
She's a ballet dancer.

757
00:49:08,701 --> 00:49:11,078
Did he say a belly dancer?

758
00:49:11,162 --> 00:49:13,539
I think he said a ballet dancer.

759
00:49:46,322 --> 00:49:48,032
She doesn't look like a ballet dancer.

760
00:49:48,115 --> 00:49:51,243
No, she's the bride's mother.

761
00:49:51,327 --> 00:49:53,579
She won a prize in Brussels.

762
00:49:53,662 --> 00:49:55,289
For dancing or for the chicken?

763
00:50:05,299 --> 00:50:08,302
# Hey #

764
00:50:08,385 --> 00:50:10,262
# Hey, oh, hey #

765
00:50:14,016 --> 00:50:18,979
# Hey, oh #

766
00:50:20,105 --> 00:50:21,982
# Hey #

767
00:51:28,382 --> 00:51:31,010
They certainly do some
very lovely candle work here.

768
00:51:31,093 --> 00:51:33,345
Now watch yourself
Lionel, endeavor to temper

769
00:51:33,429 --> 00:51:36,557
with your personality your
body cannot restraint.

770
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,225
Why can't I just sit here?

771
00:52:08,505 --> 00:52:09,256
# Hey #

772
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,674
# Oh #

773
00:52:10,758 --> 00:52:15,763
# Hey oh, ho #

774
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:22,186
# Oh hey #

775
00:52:23,979 --> 00:52:28,275
# Hey oh #

776
00:52:28,359 --> 00:52:30,444
# Oh, oh #

777
00:52:38,702 --> 00:52:40,537
# Hey #

778
00:52:43,415 --> 00:52:44,667
What is he saying?

779
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:47,086
They are selling the bride.

780
00:52:47,169 --> 00:52:48,921
He just got her.

781
00:52:49,004 --> 00:52:51,090
If anyone wants
to dance with the bride,

782
00:52:51,173 --> 00:52:52,424
he has to pay.

783
00:52:52,508 --> 00:52:54,134
It's an old British custom.

784
00:52:54,218 --> 00:52:55,260
I'll be a customer.

785
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:42,725
What, you're the cheapest, meanest man

786
00:53:42,808 --> 00:53:44,184
that ever went to a wedding.

787
00:53:45,269 --> 00:53:48,105
Ooh.

788
00:53:48,188 --> 00:53:51,900
# Hey, oh, hey, oh #

789
00:53:51,984 --> 00:53:54,027
# Hey, hey #

790
00:53:54,111 --> 00:53:56,196
# Hey, oh, hey, oh #

791
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,574
# Hey, oh, hey, oh #

792
00:53:58,657 --> 00:53:59,908
# Hey, hey #

793
00:54:01,076 --> 00:54:03,454
Money please, money, please, please,

794
00:54:03,537 --> 00:54:05,998
more money, more money.

795
00:54:06,123 --> 00:54:08,083
Please more money, more money.

796
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:10,252
Have you lost your presence of mind?

797
00:54:10,335 --> 00:54:11,170
What's the difference?

798
00:54:11,253 --> 00:54:12,963
We're gonna have plenty of
money once we get to Budapest

799
00:54:13,046 --> 00:54:14,715
and we get the head of Saint Laszlo.

800
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:15,591
Quiet.

801
00:54:16,508 --> 00:54:17,301
Aww, what you kick me for?

802
00:54:17,384 --> 00:54:18,927
All I said was Saint Laszlo.

803
00:54:19,011 --> 00:54:19,970
Quiet.

804
01:01:35,457 --> 01:01:38,627
That's the house of Parliament there.

805
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:50,889
Look, Michael, Fisherman's Bastion!

806
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:52,224
Where, over there?

807
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:53,142
Yes!

808
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:03,444
Look, the Chain Bridge, Michael!

809
01:03:30,322 --> 01:03:31,490
What's it say?

810
01:03:31,573 --> 01:03:33,242
Just a minute, it's very long.

811
01:03:33,325 --> 01:03:35,786
Palmer indubitably imposter.

812
01:03:35,869 --> 01:03:37,579
Hurray!

813
01:03:37,663 --> 01:03:38,580
Let's go and tell Dad!

814
01:03:38,664 --> 01:03:39,707
Right!

815
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:42,626
When this man,
Palmer, came to Italy,

816
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:44,753
he called himself.

817
01:03:44,837 --> 01:03:48,841
We feared that some of our
priceless antique relics

818
01:03:48,924 --> 01:03:50,092
- would disappear.
- Yes?

819
01:03:51,385 --> 01:03:53,137
Oh, oh, they're here, are they?

820
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:53,971
Well, tell 'em I'll be right out.

821
01:03:54,054 --> 01:03:55,681
An Etruscan tomb.

822
01:03:55,764 --> 01:03:57,182
The tomb was empty.

823
01:03:58,392 --> 01:04:02,187
And another thing, our fingerprint experts

824
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:03,480
have reached the point,

825
01:04:04,356 --> 01:04:06,066
- frequently ascertain...
- Here he is.

826
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,026
Dad, you know that
man we told you about?

827
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:10,028
He really is a fraud.

828
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:10,904
What man, darling?

829
01:04:10,988 --> 01:04:11,947
The man we phoned about.

830
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:13,866
We think he stole the golden head.

831
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:16,910
Well, surely you've heard about that, Dad.

832
01:04:16,994 --> 01:04:18,078
Of course I have, the Hungarian police

833
01:04:18,162 --> 01:04:19,329
are talking about nothing else.

834
01:04:19,413 --> 01:04:21,790
If you're so sure, why didn't
you get in touch with them?

835
01:04:21,874 --> 01:04:23,125
We tried like mad.

836
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:24,251
They won't believe us.

837
01:04:24,334 --> 01:04:27,129
Milly tried to tell them about
them at Gyor and Esztergom,

838
01:04:27,212 --> 01:04:28,380
but they just won't believe us.

839
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:30,382
So we sent a cable to London,

840
01:04:30,466 --> 01:04:32,092
and we found out there's no such man.

841
01:04:32,176 --> 01:04:33,594
I mean, no such address,

842
01:04:33,677 --> 01:04:35,804
and so we sent a photo from Visegrad.

843
01:04:35,888 --> 01:04:36,638
Who the devil to?

844
01:04:36,722 --> 01:04:38,223
A friend.

845
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:40,809
What are you all talking about?

846
01:04:40,893 --> 01:04:43,896
It's true, he gave us a
false address in St. James's.

847
01:04:46,023 --> 01:04:47,232
You mean he's English?

848
01:04:48,692 --> 01:04:49,443
What are you trying to do,

849
01:04:49,526 --> 01:04:51,904
disgrace me with the
British delegation here?

850
01:04:53,363 --> 01:04:55,073
Anna, for heaven's sake,
get them out of here

851
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:56,450
and show them Budapest, or something.

852
01:04:56,533 --> 01:04:58,702
And Milly, will you
please leave the police

853
01:04:58,786 --> 01:05:00,829
to do their own job?

854
01:05:00,913 --> 01:05:03,791
But I'm positive I
saw it in the caravan,

855
01:05:03,874 --> 01:05:05,709
and now they're following us.

856
01:05:05,793 --> 01:05:09,421
Milly, that room there
is full of police officials

857
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:10,547
from all over the world.

858
01:05:10,631 --> 01:05:12,132
Are you trying to tell
me that you can do better

859
01:05:12,216 --> 01:05:14,051
than all of them put together?

860
01:05:14,134 --> 01:05:17,429
Dad, take this picture
just in case, huh?

861
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:18,680
Oh, all right.

862
01:05:18,764 --> 01:05:20,599
Stevenson, be a good
fellow and come and show me

863
01:05:20,682 --> 01:05:22,142
where the notes are on the
forgery case, will you?

864
01:05:22,226 --> 01:05:23,519
We'll need them in a jiffy.

865
01:05:23,602 --> 01:05:25,103
- Hello, you lot.
- Good afternoon.

866
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:26,355
- Come on, old man!
- Goodbye.

867
01:05:26,438 --> 01:05:27,272
Goodbye.

868
01:05:29,858 --> 01:05:32,945
Why is Dad so much more helpful
in print than in real life?

869
01:05:34,863 --> 01:05:37,032
There are plenty of things
to see on Saturday afternoon.

870
01:05:37,115 --> 01:05:38,492
Where would you like to go?

871
01:05:39,868 --> 01:05:41,245
The movies.

872
01:05:41,328 --> 01:05:42,412
Football.

873
01:05:42,496 --> 01:05:44,331
All right, football.

874
01:05:44,414 --> 01:05:46,708
Number seven bus will take
you right to the stadium

875
01:05:46,792 --> 01:05:49,294
and you can take a taxi back to the boat.

876
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:51,046
What are we grown-ups gonna do?

877
01:05:52,506 --> 01:05:53,757
You will see.

878
01:05:55,133 --> 01:05:57,344
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

879
01:05:57,427 --> 01:05:59,346
Welcome to the Turf Club.

880
01:05:59,429 --> 01:06:02,683
Well, Basil, how we
gonna bet without losing?

881
01:06:03,517 --> 01:06:05,602
Very simple, we won't use our money.

882
01:06:05,686 --> 01:06:06,895
Well, then whose?

883
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:08,856
His.

884
01:06:10,858 --> 01:06:11,984
Go on, get it.

885
01:06:12,067 --> 01:06:13,443
Lesson number four.

886
01:06:30,752 --> 01:06:31,837
I didn't get it.

887
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,171
I know.

888
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:34,715
Now, Lionel, pay attention.

889
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:37,759
This is absolutely the last
time I'm going to show you.

890
01:07:00,407 --> 01:07:01,742
See what I mean?

891
01:07:06,038 --> 01:07:06,955
Oh!

892
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,290
Now, give it back.

893
01:07:08,373 --> 01:07:09,458
Back?

894
01:07:09,541 --> 01:07:11,919
Give it back and look sad.

895
01:07:12,002 --> 01:07:13,211
Don't worry, I will.

896
01:07:14,129 --> 01:07:15,047
You're kidding, huh?

897
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:16,465
No, no, go on.

898
01:07:17,716 --> 01:07:18,508
But...

899
01:07:18,592 --> 01:07:20,677
And don't forget to look sad.

900
01:07:20,761 --> 01:07:22,387
Don't forget to...

901
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:10,018
Okay.

902
01:08:10,102 --> 01:08:13,021
Now, look, the big payoff comes
if you can pick number one

903
01:08:13,105 --> 01:08:14,773
and number two.

904
01:08:14,856 --> 01:08:17,734
So we're gonna bet that
on number five and six.

905
01:08:17,818 --> 01:08:18,568
They're longshots.

906
01:08:18,652 --> 01:08:21,029
That' right, big risk, big money.

907
01:08:21,113 --> 01:08:24,199
Now, you take that and
we bet half on number six

908
01:08:24,282 --> 01:08:26,618
to come in first, and the
other half on number five

909
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:28,662
to come in second, okay, got that?

910
01:08:28,745 --> 01:08:31,832
Yes, six to come in first
and five to come in second.

911
01:08:31,915 --> 01:08:32,666
Right.

912
01:08:32,749 --> 01:08:34,668
Six to come in first,
five to come in second.

913
01:08:34,751 --> 01:08:38,880
And six to come in first,
and five to come in second.

914
01:08:38,964 --> 01:08:42,092
And six to come in first,
and five to come in second.

915
01:08:42,175 --> 01:08:44,845
Six to come in first and
five to come in second.

916
01:08:44,928 --> 01:08:46,847
And six to come in, oh!

917
01:08:50,767 --> 01:08:55,522
Five to come in first and
six to come in second.

918
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:08,702
The horses are
approaching the starting line.

919
01:10:39,751 --> 01:10:41,253
Can't win 'em all, you know?

920
01:10:41,336 --> 01:10:42,379
You were silly, Basil.

921
01:10:42,462 --> 01:10:45,549
You should have bet five
and six, not six and five.

922
01:10:45,632 --> 01:10:47,843
The results of the first race are

923
01:10:47,926 --> 01:10:49,594
number five wins.

924
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:51,972
Lionel, you made a mistake!

925
01:10:52,055 --> 01:10:54,057
I'm sorry about that, Basil.

926
01:10:55,016 --> 01:10:56,726
Well, this time, I'll forgive you.

927
01:10:56,810 --> 01:10:58,436
Come on, let's collect our money.

928
01:11:02,649 --> 01:11:05,485
I'm sorry, I cannot
pay out on this ticket.

929
01:11:05,569 --> 01:11:06,778
It's a torn ticket.

930
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:08,572
Oh, come now, I paid for it.

931
01:11:08,655 --> 01:11:09,948
Just a minute.

932
01:11:10,031 --> 01:11:10,949
Hey, what's he sayin'?

933
01:11:11,032 --> 01:11:12,742
He says he can't pay
out on a torn ticket.

934
01:11:12,826 --> 01:11:13,577
Oh!

935
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:15,120
Would you mind letting us take a picture

936
01:11:15,203 --> 01:11:16,413
for The Evening Gazette?

937
01:11:16,496 --> 01:11:17,247
Sure.

938
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:18,165
If it's not too much trouble.

939
01:11:18,248 --> 01:11:19,082
Okay.

940
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:21,835
There you are.

941
01:11:21,918 --> 01:11:22,919
Very good!

942
01:11:25,589 --> 01:11:26,673
There it is.

943
01:11:26,756 --> 01:11:29,009
Can I have both your names
so I have a record of it

944
01:11:29,092 --> 01:11:29,926
in my files?

945
01:11:52,032 --> 01:11:53,700
Yes, what is it?

946
01:11:53,783 --> 01:11:58,121
The Honorable Augustus
Brookington-Smythe

947
01:11:58,205 --> 01:12:00,540
wishes to see you on
an urgent matter, sir.

948
01:12:00,624 --> 01:12:02,918
I don't know any Augustus Thingamabob.

949
01:12:04,336 --> 01:12:05,587
Oh.

950
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:06,630
Now, wait a minute.

951
01:12:07,631 --> 01:12:09,549
Yes, of course, that'll be Diana's boy.

952
01:12:11,551 --> 01:12:13,011
All right, show him in.

953
01:12:13,094 --> 01:12:14,512
Very well, sir.

954
01:12:17,724 --> 01:12:18,975
Good afternoon, sir.

955
01:12:19,059 --> 01:12:21,561
My mother asked to be remembered to you.

956
01:12:21,645 --> 01:12:23,939
When I mentioned my
particular problem to her,

957
01:12:24,022 --> 01:12:25,941
she said you'd be sure to help

958
01:12:26,024 --> 01:12:27,609
if I reminded you of the evening

959
01:12:27,692 --> 01:12:30,320
of Queen Charlotte's Ball in 1951.

960
01:12:31,488 --> 01:12:36,076
Oh, that's the way it is, eh?

961
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:39,579
Still, it was a rather wonderful evening.

962
01:12:42,123 --> 01:12:44,042
Right, now, what can I do for you?

963
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:48,296
Could you tell me if these men

964
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:50,423
are in your international rogues gallery?

965
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:54,594
Oh, yes, I think we might manage that.

966
01:12:54,678 --> 01:12:55,887
Anything else?

967
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:58,556
Well, sir, if the resultant information

968
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,101
were to prove interesting,

969
01:13:01,184 --> 01:13:03,395
I assume you could get
a message to Budapest

970
01:13:03,478 --> 01:13:04,646
quicker than I could.

971
01:13:04,771 --> 01:13:08,650
Well, yes, of course, I
mean, did you say Budapest?

972
01:13:08,733 --> 01:13:10,360
Yes, I did, to the police there.

973
01:13:10,443 --> 01:13:14,489
Now, on second thought, for
the sake of national prestige,

974
01:13:14,572 --> 01:13:18,034
it might be preferable to
get it to old man Stevenson.

975
01:13:18,118 --> 01:13:18,868
Who?

976
01:13:18,952 --> 01:13:21,454
Stevenson, he's at the
International Conference

977
01:13:21,538 --> 01:13:22,664
on Criminal Law.

978
01:13:22,747 --> 01:13:24,040
You know him.

979
01:13:24,124 --> 01:13:25,542
Why, yes, of course.

980
01:13:26,418 --> 01:13:27,794
Now, look here, young man,

981
01:13:27,877 --> 01:13:30,088
there are quite a few
questions I'd like to ask you.

982
01:13:30,171 --> 01:13:32,841
What about the photograph first?

983
01:13:32,924 --> 01:13:34,259
What?

984
01:13:34,342 --> 01:13:36,011
Oh, photograph, yes.

985
01:14:11,796 --> 01:14:13,882
Well, it's still there.

986
01:14:41,034 --> 01:14:42,202
It's Palmer!

987
01:14:44,287 --> 01:14:45,872
It is Palmer.

988
01:14:45,955 --> 01:14:47,832
For once, you're not seeing things.

989
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:49,250
I wonder what it says.

990
01:14:51,544 --> 01:14:54,381
Gellert Hotel, we can understand that.

991
01:14:54,464 --> 01:14:56,132
Gellert Hotel, that's near us!

992
01:15:08,019 --> 01:15:09,604
There's somebody on our boat!

993
01:15:09,687 --> 01:15:10,897
Hey, what are you doing?

994
01:15:23,618 --> 01:15:27,288
You dirty rotten,
stay away from our boat!

995
01:15:28,832 --> 01:15:30,458
I wonder what they were doing.

996
01:15:32,043 --> 01:15:33,044
Let's take a look.

997
01:15:40,468 --> 01:15:41,428
I wonder what it is.

998
01:15:41,511 --> 01:15:42,387
I don't know.

999
01:15:47,392 --> 01:15:48,810
The golden head!

1000
01:16:08,371 --> 01:16:11,291
Those men must have been
in Palmer's gang, but why?

1001
01:16:11,374 --> 01:16:14,169
Don't you see, things
got too hot for them,

1002
01:16:14,252 --> 01:16:16,004
so they planted it on us.

1003
01:16:16,087 --> 01:16:17,672
Police would never fall for that.

1004
01:16:17,755 --> 01:16:18,506
Why not?

1005
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:20,175
They didn't believe us before.

1006
01:16:20,258 --> 01:16:21,593
Wait till Michael and Anna see this.

1007
01:16:21,676 --> 01:16:24,179
You can't show it to Michael and Anna!

1008
01:16:24,262 --> 01:16:25,221
What's the matter with you?

1009
01:16:25,305 --> 01:16:26,556
Of course we can.

1010
01:16:26,639 --> 01:16:27,557
Don't you see?

1011
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:29,559
Anna's Hungarian, and she'd
have to tell the police,

1012
01:16:29,642 --> 01:16:32,020
and Daddy told us to lay off Palmer.

1013
01:16:32,103 --> 01:16:34,022
Hmm, what can we do then?

1014
01:16:35,231 --> 01:16:37,984
Palmer and his gang planted it on us,

1015
01:16:38,067 --> 01:16:39,694
so we must go to the Gellert Hotel

1016
01:16:39,777 --> 01:16:43,323
and plant it on Palmer
instead, then go to the police.

1017
01:16:43,406 --> 01:16:45,742
We better leave a note
for Michael and Anna.

1018
01:16:45,825 --> 01:16:48,036
They'll be in a fit
wondering where we've been.

1019
01:16:59,797 --> 01:17:01,299
Is this more like it, Michael?

1020
01:17:01,382 --> 01:17:02,217
Yes, it is.

1021
01:17:03,593 --> 01:17:06,387
I'm sorry your friend
wasn't able to come with us.

1022
01:17:06,471 --> 01:17:08,848
Oh, Michael, you're not a good liar.

1023
01:17:08,932 --> 01:17:09,766
No, I'm not.

1024
01:17:12,018 --> 01:17:15,188
The truth is, I wanted
to be alone with you.

1025
01:17:36,376 --> 01:17:38,628
Let's get outta here.

1026
01:17:38,711 --> 01:17:39,754
Come on.

1027
01:17:58,356 --> 01:18:00,650
Put that note where
they'll be sure to see it.

1028
01:18:08,199 --> 01:18:09,117
Right, ready?

1029
01:18:20,461 --> 01:18:22,297
There's Dad, what are we gonna do?

1030
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:23,214
Hide it!

1031
01:18:28,344 --> 01:18:29,971
- Hello, Dad.
- Where are Michael and Anna?

1032
01:18:30,054 --> 01:18:33,224
Oh, they had something special
to see, some kinda museum.

1033
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:34,892
They shouldn't be too long.

1034
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:36,394
Are you up to something?

1035
01:18:36,477 --> 01:18:37,979
No, Daddy.

1036
01:18:38,062 --> 01:18:38,938
You've stopped all this cops

1037
01:18:39,022 --> 01:18:40,148
and robbers nonsense, have you?

1038
01:18:40,273 --> 01:18:41,899
Yes, Daddy.

1039
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:42,984
Thank goodness for that.

1040
01:18:43,109 --> 01:18:45,236
I say, old man, you are
watching the time, aren't you?

1041
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,196
Oh, yes, now, we're
off for a special showing

1042
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,740
of the ballet with the other delegates.

1043
01:18:48,823 --> 01:18:52,410
Now, we'll take you next
time if you're good, right?

1044
01:18:52,493 --> 01:18:53,620
Yes, Daddy.

1045
01:18:53,745 --> 01:18:54,662
Right.

1046
01:18:54,746 --> 01:18:55,580
Cheerio.

1047
01:19:03,379 --> 01:19:05,923
Oh, dear.

1048
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:22,398
Hey, what's this?

1049
01:19:24,734 --> 01:19:26,819
Got the golden head.

1050
01:19:26,903 --> 01:19:29,739
Planting it on Palmer,
then telling police.

1051
01:19:29,822 --> 01:19:31,949
Don't contact police till we're ready.

1052
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:34,369
If you do, it will spoil everything.

1053
01:19:34,452 --> 01:19:36,162
Do you really think they have the head?

1054
01:19:36,245 --> 01:19:37,455
I don't know.

1055
01:19:37,538 --> 01:19:41,376
Crazy kids, they imagine
anything, specially Milly.

1056
01:19:43,336 --> 01:19:45,254
Well, we'll just have to wait.

1057
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:07,610
Excuse me, please.

1058
01:20:08,444 --> 01:20:09,404
What do you want?

1059
01:20:09,487 --> 01:20:11,155
We have something to
leave for Mr. Palmer.

1060
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:12,740
He's a friend of my father's.

1061
01:20:12,824 --> 01:20:13,866
Palmer?

1062
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:15,993
Oh, yes, he's in room 244.

1063
01:20:16,077 --> 01:20:17,412
He's at dinner now.

1064
01:20:18,371 --> 01:20:20,915
If you want to see him,
you'll have to wait a while.

1065
01:20:20,998 --> 01:20:21,833
Just a minute.

1066
01:20:47,066 --> 01:20:49,152
It's locked, what can we do?

1067
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:54,949
Do you speak English?

1068
01:20:55,032 --> 01:20:56,200
A little.

1069
01:20:56,284 --> 01:20:57,744
We have a present for Mr. Palmer.

1070
01:20:57,827 --> 01:20:59,662
Do you think we could leave it?

1071
01:21:01,706 --> 01:21:02,540
Yes.

1072
01:21:15,094 --> 01:21:15,970
Thank you.

1073
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:19,182
Keep watch on the door while I try

1074
01:21:19,265 --> 01:21:20,725
and find a good hiding place.

1075
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:34,113
Someone's coming!

1076
01:21:34,197 --> 01:21:35,156
It's those other two!

1077
01:21:35,239 --> 01:21:37,283
But I haven't hidden the head yet!

1078
01:21:37,366 --> 01:21:38,701
Under the bed!

1079
01:22:47,228 --> 01:22:49,689
Good work, Milly, but Palmer
will only let them out again.

1080
01:22:49,814 --> 01:22:52,275
Well, I had to do something.

1081
01:22:57,613 --> 01:23:00,491
Either making these key holes
lower or I'm gettin' taller.

1082
01:24:03,804 --> 01:24:04,639
Hey!

1083
01:24:05,681 --> 01:24:07,308
There's a picture of Palmer here.

1084
01:24:09,101 --> 01:24:10,895
Anna, what does this say?

1085
01:24:15,149 --> 01:24:17,401
They won a lot of
money at the racetrack.

1086
01:24:18,653 --> 01:24:21,739
He's staying at the Gellert Hotel.

1087
01:24:21,822 --> 01:24:23,199
Anna, did you buy that paper?

1088
01:24:23,282 --> 01:24:24,241
No.

1089
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:26,035
Well, then the kids must have done it,

1090
01:24:26,118 --> 01:24:28,329
and they know Palmer's
at the Gellert Hotel.

1091
01:24:29,372 --> 01:24:30,206
Come on.

1092
01:24:37,505 --> 01:24:39,090
What time should I set it for?

1093
01:24:39,173 --> 01:24:40,925
Oh, about 3:30.

1094
01:24:42,009 --> 01:24:43,386
AM or PM?

1095
01:24:43,469 --> 01:24:44,303
Either one.

1096
01:24:48,307 --> 01:24:51,602
Why can't we sleep with our clothes off?

1097
01:24:51,686 --> 01:24:54,438
He travels fastest who travels dressed.

1098
01:24:55,856 --> 01:24:56,774
That's beautiful.

1099
01:24:57,733 --> 01:24:59,318
Did a great man say that?

1100
01:24:59,402 --> 01:25:00,528
Yes, I did.

1101
01:25:02,071 --> 01:25:03,864
Basil, don't think that I'm not grateful

1102
01:25:03,948 --> 01:25:06,450
to learn these beautiful
things and to learn a trade,

1103
01:25:06,534 --> 01:25:09,453
but when we come to a
very nice hotel like this,

1104
01:25:09,537 --> 01:25:10,705
I don't like to sneak in.

1105
01:25:10,788 --> 01:25:12,623
Why can't I be registered?

1106
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:15,543
It's just a simple matter of economics.

1107
01:25:15,626 --> 01:25:19,380
Other men my age have
wives and children, a home.

1108
01:25:19,505 --> 01:25:21,215
It isn't as though
you're not living anywhere.

1109
01:25:21,298 --> 01:25:22,800
You're living with me.

1110
01:25:22,883 --> 01:25:24,802
Then why can't I be registered?

1111
01:25:25,970 --> 01:25:27,388
It's too expensive.

1112
01:25:28,973 --> 01:25:30,766
You always charge me.

1113
01:25:31,934 --> 01:25:33,728
I never charge you the full rate.

1114
01:25:35,312 --> 01:25:36,939
That's right, you don't ever.

1115
01:25:38,733 --> 01:25:40,151
I'm sorry I mentioned it.

1116
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:42,862
Goodnight, Basil.

1117
01:25:42,945 --> 01:25:44,613
Goodnight, Lionel.

1118
01:27:07,863 --> 01:27:09,198
Hey, hey, hey!

1119
01:27:12,743 --> 01:27:14,370
I beg your pardon.

1120
01:27:14,453 --> 01:27:15,538
I'm so sorry.

1121
01:27:16,622 --> 01:27:17,373
Excuse me.

1122
01:27:21,085 --> 01:27:22,378
I beg your pardon.

1123
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:24,922
I'm so sorry.

1124
01:27:25,798 --> 01:27:27,049
I beg your pardon.

1125
01:27:49,655 --> 01:27:51,991
It's the continental exchange, old man.

1126
01:27:52,074 --> 01:27:54,952
They want to know if you'll
accept a call at midnight.

1127
01:27:55,035 --> 01:27:55,786
Who from, the Yard?

1128
01:27:55,870 --> 01:27:57,454
Yes, old man.

1129
01:27:57,538 --> 01:27:58,289
Wonder what it's about.

1130
01:27:58,372 --> 01:28:00,332
Something about a photograph
of an Englishman here.

1131
01:28:00,416 --> 01:28:01,500
Oh, no!

1132
01:28:01,584 --> 01:28:02,418
Why, did we send it?

1133
01:28:02,501 --> 01:28:04,712
No, but I have a
pretty good idea who did.

1134
01:28:04,795 --> 01:28:06,130
I'll take the call from my hotel.

1135
01:28:06,213 --> 01:28:07,882
Are you joking, at midnight?

1136
01:28:07,965 --> 01:28:09,884
But I'm taking you out to
the Budapest Bar after this!

1137
01:28:09,967 --> 01:28:11,135
- Oh, no, no.
- My dear fellow,

1138
01:28:11,218 --> 01:28:12,136
it's the hottest place in town!

1139
01:28:12,219 --> 01:28:13,679
- I really can't.
- Of course you can.

1140
01:28:13,762 --> 01:28:15,222
It's absolutely jumping!

1141
01:28:16,473 --> 01:28:17,766
- Is it?
- Mm-hmm.

1142
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:19,560
Oh.

1143
01:28:19,643 --> 01:28:20,895
All right, I'll take the call from there.

1144
01:28:20,978 --> 01:28:24,148
Oh, yes, of course, yes, yes.

1145
01:28:24,231 --> 01:28:27,193
Hello?

1146
01:29:15,115 --> 01:29:17,952
Excuse me, do you have
a Mr. Palmer staying here?

1147
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:22,581
Yes, sir, but at this hour,
I wouldn't like to bother him.

1148
01:29:22,665 --> 01:29:24,875
He went up to his room
at least two hours ago.

1149
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,336
Have any children been up to see them?

1150
01:29:27,461 --> 01:29:30,005
Yes, but that was a long time ago.

1151
01:29:30,089 --> 01:29:31,882
They wanted to leave something.

1152
01:29:31,966 --> 01:29:33,592
I'm sorry, but this is urgent.

1153
01:29:33,676 --> 01:29:35,219
Would you ask Mr. Palmer if he's seen

1154
01:29:35,302 --> 01:29:37,596
a couple of children this evening?

1155
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:40,349
He won't like being
disturbed at this hour.

1156
01:29:40,432 --> 01:29:41,267
Please.

1157
01:29:59,285 --> 01:30:00,786
What the devil do you
mean by disturbing me

1158
01:30:00,869 --> 01:30:01,745
at this time of night?

1159
01:30:01,829 --> 01:30:03,872
Are there any
children up there with you?

1160
01:30:03,956 --> 01:30:05,291
Children?

1161
01:30:05,374 --> 01:30:06,500
Don't be absurd, where would I have them,

1162
01:30:06,583 --> 01:30:09,044
under the bed or the closet or something?

1163
01:30:09,128 --> 01:30:10,504
I shall have a word to say about this

1164
01:30:10,629 --> 01:30:11,714
to the manager tomorrow.

1165
01:30:15,676 --> 01:30:16,844
- Basil!
- Yeah?

1166
01:30:16,927 --> 01:30:18,012
You remember what you were telling me

1167
01:30:18,095 --> 01:30:18,846
about here in Hungary,

1168
01:30:18,929 --> 01:30:21,598
the people take the hot showers together?

1169
01:30:21,682 --> 01:30:22,433
Yes?

1170
01:30:22,516 --> 01:30:23,726
Well, can't you arrange one for me

1171
01:30:23,809 --> 01:30:25,227
before we get outta here?

1172
01:30:26,562 --> 01:30:28,564
Oh, there won't be time, Lionel.

1173
01:30:29,815 --> 01:30:33,277
But never mind, you can
have a fine hot bath

1174
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:35,029
when we get to Japan.

1175
01:30:35,112 --> 01:30:36,030
In Japan?

1176
01:30:36,113 --> 01:30:38,073
Mm-hmm.

1177
01:30:41,785 --> 01:30:42,536
Apart from forcing an entry,

1178
01:30:42,619 --> 01:30:44,872
I don't know what else we can do.

1179
01:30:44,955 --> 01:30:46,165
Where on Earth are they?

1180
01:30:47,583 --> 01:30:49,501
Let's find your father.

1181
01:30:49,585 --> 01:30:50,502
We can try.

1182
01:31:14,568 --> 01:31:16,528
Your London call, Mr. Stevenson.

1183
01:31:16,612 --> 01:31:17,363
Hmm?

1184
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:27,164
Hello?

1185
01:31:28,082 --> 01:31:29,708
Oh, hello, sir.

1186
01:31:29,792 --> 01:31:31,085
Yes, fine, fine.

1187
01:31:32,086 --> 01:31:33,379
What?

1188
01:31:33,462 --> 01:31:35,672
Oh, yes, I wanted to apologize about that.

1189
01:31:36,882 --> 01:31:37,883
What are you talking about?

1190
01:31:37,966 --> 01:31:40,302
I should apologize for being so late.

1191
01:31:40,386 --> 01:31:42,262
I've been trying to get you all night.

1192
01:31:42,346 --> 01:31:43,472
Quite brilliant of you, you know,

1193
01:31:43,555 --> 01:31:45,599
to recognize Palmer's technique.

1194
01:31:46,517 --> 01:31:47,643
You can bet your bottom dollar

1195
01:31:47,726 --> 01:31:49,311
he's got that Hungarian whatsit.

1196
01:31:50,312 --> 01:31:52,106
Clever idea, getting that picture.

1197
01:31:52,189 --> 01:31:54,316
Bright kids you got there, eh?

1198
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,402
Uh, yes.

1199
01:31:56,527 --> 01:31:59,363
Yeah, well, you give them
a pat on the head from me.

1200
01:31:59,446 --> 01:32:00,948
I hope you get your man.

1201
01:32:01,031 --> 01:32:03,075
Bet the Hungarians are
pleased with you, eh?

1202
01:32:03,158 --> 01:32:05,035
Well, that's all, I just
wanted to let you know

1203
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:06,954
that we're proud of you.

1204
01:32:07,037 --> 01:32:07,788
Goodbye.

1205
01:32:11,667 --> 01:32:12,501
Goodbye.

1206
01:32:16,588 --> 01:32:17,714
Braithwaite, Braithwaite!

1207
01:32:19,466 --> 01:32:20,259
Braithwaite!

1208
01:32:23,846 --> 01:32:25,597
You know that fellow
the kids were on about?

1209
01:32:25,681 --> 01:32:26,473
Well, he's a criminal.

1210
01:32:26,557 --> 01:32:27,975
He's probably stolen
that golden head thing.

1211
01:32:28,058 --> 01:32:30,436
Impossible, he's English!

1212
01:32:30,519 --> 01:32:31,311
Well, let's face it, old man,

1213
01:32:31,395 --> 01:32:32,479
if there weren't some English crooks,

1214
01:32:32,563 --> 01:32:33,689
I'd be out of business.

1215
01:32:34,565 --> 01:32:35,649
Old man.

1216
01:32:35,732 --> 01:32:37,359
There's only one thing we must do.

1217
01:32:37,443 --> 01:32:38,402
We must nab him ourselves,

1218
01:32:38,485 --> 01:32:39,987
then hand him over to
the Hungarians, right?

1219
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:41,738
- Right.
- Let's go.

1220
01:32:41,822 --> 01:32:44,366
Oh, just a second, seems
I've forgotten something.

1221
01:32:44,450 --> 01:32:45,742
What?

1222
01:32:45,826 --> 01:32:46,827
Oh, doesn't matter.

1223
01:32:53,959 --> 01:32:55,878
They said he's
he went to the theater,

1224
01:32:55,961 --> 01:32:58,630
and up till now, he hasn't come back yet.

1225
01:32:58,714 --> 01:33:00,090
He must be working late.

1226
01:33:01,133 --> 01:33:03,427
We must go to the police and inform them

1227
01:33:03,510 --> 01:33:04,970
that the children are missing.

1228
01:33:05,053 --> 01:33:06,430
I'm afraid so.

1229
01:33:06,513 --> 01:33:07,639
We'd better get back to the boat

1230
01:33:07,723 --> 01:33:09,057
and wait in case they're found.

1231
01:33:09,141 --> 01:33:10,142
All right.

1232
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,323
Hurry up.

1233
01:34:36,019 --> 01:34:38,313
Tell me which room the children were in!

1234
01:34:38,397 --> 01:34:39,731
What children?

1235
01:34:45,737 --> 01:34:48,323
We've never been out so
early in the morning before.

1236
01:34:48,407 --> 01:34:51,201
Ah, he'll tell us how to
get to the police station.

1237
01:34:51,285 --> 01:34:52,119
Mister!

1238
01:34:53,537 --> 01:34:55,205
We know who's stolen the golden head,

1239
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:57,082
and we want you to arrest him.

1240
01:35:00,335 --> 01:35:02,629
I guess he doesn't
understand plain English.

1241
01:35:10,137 --> 01:35:10,887
Hi, Dad.

1242
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:11,930
Where are the children?

1243
01:35:12,014 --> 01:35:12,889
They're lost.

1244
01:35:12,973 --> 01:35:14,433
Not playing detective again!

1245
01:35:14,516 --> 01:35:15,559
I'm afraid so.

1246
01:35:16,643 --> 01:35:18,145
We've told the police.

1247
01:35:18,228 --> 01:35:20,022
Yes, that man Palmer you were on about,

1248
01:35:20,105 --> 01:35:21,273
he's a crook, you know?

1249
01:35:21,356 --> 01:35:23,358
Scotland Yard's identified his photograph.

1250
01:35:23,442 --> 01:35:26,653
That's wonderful, but
what about the children?

1251
01:35:26,737 --> 01:35:28,697
Yes, the truth is they've
gone off to Palmer alone.

1252
01:35:28,780 --> 01:35:29,573
What?

1253
01:35:29,656 --> 01:35:30,741
They left a note.

1254
01:35:30,824 --> 01:35:31,575
He's staying at the Gellert.

1255
01:35:31,658 --> 01:35:33,744
The Gellert, right, come on, after them.

1256
01:35:35,871 --> 01:35:36,872
Oh, dear.

1257
01:35:40,083 --> 01:35:40,834
Well, how'd you like that?

1258
01:35:40,917 --> 01:35:41,877
After all we've been through,

1259
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,837
they go and arrest him by themselves.

1260
01:35:45,088 --> 01:35:46,381
Come on, let's get a taxi.

1261
01:35:50,677 --> 01:35:52,596
Which room is Mr. Palmer in, please?

1262
01:35:54,181 --> 01:35:56,391
244,

1263
01:35:56,475 --> 01:35:58,602
- but don't you disturb him!
- Room 244.

1264
01:36:11,782 --> 01:36:13,116
Ah, here we are.

1265
01:36:13,992 --> 01:36:15,702
Now, both together, Braithwaite.

1266
01:36:15,786 --> 01:36:17,371
One, two...

1267
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:22,542
Now, come along, Palmer.

1268
01:36:22,626 --> 01:36:25,462
We're handing you over to
the Hungarian authorities.

1269
01:36:25,545 --> 01:36:27,214
Have I had the pleasure?

1270
01:36:27,297 --> 01:36:28,965
Stevenson of Scotland Yard,

1271
01:36:29,049 --> 01:36:31,551
and this is Mr. Braithwaite.

1272
01:36:31,635 --> 01:36:32,636
You're under arrest.

1273
01:36:33,553 --> 01:36:34,763
And what is the charge?

1274
01:36:34,888 --> 01:36:36,848
Stealing the golden head of St. Laszlo,

1275
01:36:36,932 --> 01:36:38,767
which appears to be lying on the bed.

1276
01:36:40,936 --> 01:36:42,604
Don't try anything, Palmer.

1277
01:36:42,688 --> 01:36:44,815
We've both of us played rugby football.

1278
01:36:44,898 --> 01:36:48,151
Ah, but have you ever
played it in a snowstorm?

1279
01:36:48,235 --> 01:36:50,070
What?

1280
01:36:50,195 --> 01:36:51,571
Snowstorm.

1281
01:36:51,697 --> 01:36:53,198
You know, as a matter of fact, I have.

1282
01:36:53,281 --> 01:36:56,076
It was the winter of '38,
I remember it very well.

1283
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:57,494
It was a grizzly day.

1284
01:36:57,619 --> 01:36:58,453
We were playing against Richmond,

1285
01:36:58,537 --> 01:36:59,496
I was playing for at the time,

1286
01:36:59,621 --> 01:37:00,122
and I came out of the scrimmage...

1287
01:37:00,205 --> 01:37:02,124
- 1938, you say?
- Yes, '38.

1288
01:37:02,249 --> 01:37:03,875
Anyway, I got on.

1289
01:37:17,639 --> 01:37:18,390
Milly!

1290
01:37:22,352 --> 01:37:23,895
Oh, you naughty, naughty children!

1291
01:37:23,979 --> 01:37:25,772
What have you been doing?

1292
01:37:25,856 --> 01:37:27,691
We were so worried about you.

1293
01:37:27,774 --> 01:37:29,234
You shouldn't have been
worried, we were all right.

1294
01:37:29,317 --> 01:37:31,737
I ought to bang your heads together!

1295
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:33,196
But we planted the head on Palmer.

1296
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:34,698
We just brought the police.

1297
01:37:34,781 --> 01:37:35,782
We must find Daddy.

1298
01:37:35,866 --> 01:37:37,868
Dad's here, he got here
before the police did.

1299
01:37:37,951 --> 01:37:39,244
Well, let's go and help.

1300
01:37:39,327 --> 01:37:40,579
Okay, but I still think Dad's

1301
01:37:40,662 --> 01:37:42,038
got everything under control.

1302
01:37:45,125 --> 01:37:45,876
Palmer!

1303
01:39:04,496 --> 01:39:05,497
There he is!

1304
01:39:12,087 --> 01:39:14,798
There's the right way
now, come on, let's get out.

1305
01:39:24,683 --> 01:39:25,725
Mr. Stevenson!

1306
01:39:27,185 --> 01:39:28,854
Looks like you're in a snowstorm.

1307
01:39:28,937 --> 01:39:29,771
Oh, thank heaven you're here.

1308
01:39:29,855 --> 01:39:31,273
Palmer just got away with the head.

1309
01:39:31,356 --> 01:39:33,608
I understand Scotland Yard
recognized the photographs.

1310
01:39:33,692 --> 01:39:35,151
Congratulations.

1311
01:39:35,235 --> 01:39:37,696
Oh, it's just routine stuff.

1312
01:39:56,631 --> 01:39:58,592
There they are, and the children.

1313
01:39:58,675 --> 01:39:59,593
After them.

1314
01:40:01,261 --> 01:40:03,722
Come on, Milly, come on!

1315
01:40:24,826 --> 01:40:25,869
Back to the car.

1316
01:40:25,952 --> 01:40:27,746
And for heaven's sake, all
of you, just stay here.

1317
01:40:27,829 --> 01:40:29,998
Just stay here till I
come back and get you.

1318
01:40:36,212 --> 01:40:37,297
Oh, there's my friend.

1319
01:40:39,883 --> 01:40:40,800
Who is he?

1320
01:40:40,884 --> 01:40:42,177
Oh, he's all right, come on.

1321
01:41:17,462 --> 01:41:18,964
This is beautiful!

1322
01:41:19,047 --> 01:41:22,092
When we sell the head, why
don't we get one of these?

1323
01:41:22,175 --> 01:41:24,010
Well, I prefer a convertible.

1324
01:41:24,094 --> 01:41:25,679
Oh, well...

1325
01:42:29,993 --> 01:42:31,578
Come on now, let's get out here.

1326
01:42:31,661 --> 01:42:32,912
Oh, no, really!

1327
01:42:34,581 --> 01:42:38,501
Come on, come on, get
the train, get the train!

1328
01:43:58,206 --> 01:43:59,040
Come on!

1329
01:44:03,753 --> 01:44:05,171
There they are!

1330
01:44:06,881 --> 01:44:08,341
Come on, after them!

1331
01:44:26,317 --> 01:44:28,027
Well, you wanted to see the city.

1332
01:44:28,111 --> 01:44:29,612
Now take a good look.

1333
01:44:46,629 --> 01:44:51,593
We can catch them on the
side of the river.

1334
01:44:59,767 --> 01:45:02,228
Come on, back in the car, come on!

1335
01:46:38,324 --> 01:46:40,243
Oh, that's all we need!

1336
01:46:42,412 --> 01:46:43,413
Get on with it!

1337
01:46:46,666 --> 01:46:47,959
Back in the car.

1338
01:48:11,042 --> 01:48:11,793
Shut up!

1339
01:48:28,643 --> 01:48:32,480
Gentlemen, I have the most
wonderful news for you.

1340
01:48:32,563 --> 01:48:35,942
We have recovered the
golden head of St. Laszlo.

1341
01:48:43,533 --> 01:48:45,660
That's him, you might
as well give up now.

1342
01:48:45,743 --> 01:48:47,662
Oh, pay no attention, Lionel.

1343
01:48:47,745 --> 01:48:49,247
I take it that there is a reward

1344
01:48:49,330 --> 01:48:50,540
for the return of this priceless...

1345
01:48:50,665 --> 01:48:52,583
You can't do that!

1346
01:48:57,255 --> 01:48:59,966
Palmer, you're under arrest.

1347
01:49:01,634 --> 01:49:02,468
Oh.

1348
01:49:03,928 --> 01:49:07,140
Gentlemen, I think you should know

1349
01:49:07,223 --> 01:49:09,684
that without this young girl's help,

1350
01:49:09,809 --> 01:49:13,146
we should never have got
our golden head back again.

1351
01:49:13,229 --> 01:49:14,147
It was nothing.

1352
01:49:16,023 --> 01:49:18,985
Gentlemen, do not allow
yourselves to be swayed

1353
01:49:19,068 --> 01:49:20,653
by deceptive appearances.

1354
01:49:20,736 --> 01:49:22,321
I can explain everything.

1355
01:49:22,405 --> 01:49:24,532
You've got as much chance
talking us out of this

1356
01:49:24,615 --> 01:49:26,909
as you got at talking us
into Buckingham Palace.

1357
01:49:32,790 --> 01:49:35,668
Her Majesty has graciously
consented to receive you.

1358
01:49:35,751 --> 01:49:38,087
If you will come this way.

1359
01:49:44,469 --> 01:49:45,845
Daddy, that's Palmer.

1360
01:49:45,928 --> 01:49:47,054
Milly!

1361
01:49:47,138 --> 01:49:48,431
I, I should know.

1362
01:49:48,514 --> 01:49:51,184
Milly, for heaven's sake,
don't start that nonsense again.

1363
01:49:59,609 --> 01:50:03,196
Inspector Stevenson and his
daughter, Millicent, ma'am.

1364
01:50:13,247 --> 01:50:16,083
Ma'am, that man out there
is a well-known crook,

1365
01:50:16,167 --> 01:50:16,959
Basil Palmer.

1366
01:50:17,043 --> 01:50:18,753
Milly, for heaven's sake!

1367
01:50:22,632 --> 01:50:23,341
Lionel.

1368
01:50:23,424 --> 01:50:24,175
Yeah?

1369
01:50:24,258 --> 01:50:25,593
Time we started traveling again.

1370
01:50:25,676 --> 01:50:28,012
Wonderful, Japan will be
lovely this time of year.
