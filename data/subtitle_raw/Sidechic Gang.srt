Sweet.

18
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:04,413
Hi, my name is Baaba,
nice to meet you.

19
00:01:04,448 --> 00:01:05,620
You must be rich.

20
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:06,620
Well, my boyfriend isn't rich,

21
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:08,344
but you are definitely rich.

22
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:09,655
Are you single?

23
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,827
Well, she's not single,
but she's single.

24
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:13,137
I'm well, I'm...

25
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:14,586
- Baaba!
- What? What?

26
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,551
Just get in.

27
00:01:15,586 --> 00:01:16,413
Okay, yeah.

28
00:01:16,448 --> 00:01:17,275
Well, yeah, nice.

29
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,655
Yes, it's nice.

30
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:19,517
Open it.

31
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:20,517
It's locked.

32
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:21,827
It's locked.

33
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:22,862
Oh! Oh!

34
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:28,275
Now why did he leave?

35
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,241
Learn to keep your
mouth shut, Baaba.

36
00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:30,344
You talk too much.

37
00:01:30,379 --> 00:01:31,517
I talk too much?

38
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:33,071
I told you not to
talk to me like that.

39
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:34,517
You pay bills when I talk.

40
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:35,724
Do you pay bills?

41
00:01:35,758 --> 00:01:36,689
Do any of you pay
bills when I talk?

42
00:01:36,724 --> 00:01:37,655
Eh?

43
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:39,413
Do you pay bills when I talk?

44
00:01:39,448 --> 00:01:41,724
Blah-ba-la-la-la-la-lo-lo-lo-lo!

45
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:43,827
This is talking too much.

46
00:01:43,862 --> 00:01:45,586
Say I talk too much.

47
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,172
Oh, there's a car coming.

48
00:01:49,206 --> 00:01:51,137
Now run, move.
Go, go, go, go!

49
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,448
Hey, come back, o'.

50
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:04,241
Come back, it's a taxi.
Hah.

51
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:07,310
Let me run up.

52
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:09,413
I nearly fell down.

53
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:30,448
Hey, wait, wait.

54
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:34,655
Okay.

It's good, it's a busy street.

00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,275
Okay, Baaba, you take left.

You see, Pokua, Baaba and Fella,

Anyway, what are you doing here?

Oh, my friends and I have opened

183
00:07:34,172 --> 00:07:35,551
Anyway, let me excuse myself.

184
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:37,241
See you around, okay?

185
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:38,103
Okay.

186
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:39,551
Have a nice day.

187
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:53,206
Pokua! Pokua!

188
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:55,482
?

189
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,344
Let me tell you.

190
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:57,275
She has to know.

191
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,655
It's none of your business!

192
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:00,355
If there's any trouble,
I am not part of it,

193
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,310
I told you to not to do it.

194
00:08:01,344 --> 00:08:02,172
It's not.
Please go.

195
00:08:02,206 --> 00:08:03,103
Do you understand?

196
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:03,793
What?

197
00:08:03,827 --> 00:08:04,827
Okay, just...

198
00:08:04,862 --> 00:08:06,310
I had nothing to do with this.

199
00:08:06,344 --> 00:08:07,389
If there's any trouble, I-
She has to know.

200
00:08:07,413 --> 00:08:08,241
Just go.

201
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:09,586
Hey, hey!

202
00:08:10,482 --> 00:08:11,482
Hi, Pokua.

203
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,448
How are you doing?

204
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:14,448
- Very well.
- Yeah.

205
00:08:14,482 --> 00:08:15,413
Come on, come on in.

206
00:08:15,448 --> 00:08:16,689
- No.
- No.

207
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:19,655
Auntie Vero, I suspect your
husband is cheating on you.

208
00:08:20,862 --> 00:08:22,482
I didn't like what I saw today.

209
00:08:24,448 --> 00:08:27,137
I thought you should know so
you can keep an eye on him.

210
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:34,424
Auntie Vero, maybe you
didn't hear what I said.

211
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:35,448
Oh, I heard you.

212
00:08:36,344 --> 00:08:38,034
That's no news.

213
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:41,034
So many people tell
me this all the time,

214
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:42,724
but he denies them all.

215
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:47,137
It does haunt me,
but I have no proof

216
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:49,448
so I just pretend that
it's not happening

217
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,034
and that's how I deal.

218
00:08:52,068 --> 00:08:53,689
Auntie Vero, we're so sorry.

219
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,793
Eh?
Congratulations,

220
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:02,241
reporter.

221
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:06,172
There must be
something we can do.

222
00:09:06,206 --> 00:09:07,413
Listen, Pokua,

223
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:09,251
this woman is suffering
enough torture already,

224
00:09:09,275 --> 00:09:10,448
leave her alone!

225
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:12,206
Yes, she is.

226
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:13,586
Yes, she is.

227
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,413
But that's why I want to help.

228
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:17,137
We need to free her mind.

229
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:18,068
She has to know the truth.

230
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:19,068
Free her mind from what?

231
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,724
Truth, truth.
Everyday, truth.

232
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:21,103
What truth, Pokua?

233
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:22,034
You're the only one
who knows this truth.

234
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:23,551
Pokua, let's just leave her be.

235
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:25,172
I mean, she's living her life-
Eh?

236
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:26,137
She's happy.

237
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:27,448
Pokua, what else do you want?

238
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:29,793
She's not who?
She's not happy.

239
00:09:29,827 --> 00:09:31,275
Didn't you see
the way she talks?

240
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,389
The way she banged her door?

241
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:34,068
She's definitely not happy.

242
00:09:35,344 --> 00:09:37,413
Look, I'm a married woman too.

243
00:09:37,448 --> 00:09:38,310
- Oh.
- Eh.

244
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,448
Okay.

245
00:09:39,482 --> 00:09:40,838
I see it when
another is in trouble.

246
00:09:40,862 --> 00:09:41,793
I see it.

247
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:43,344
Okay, madam married woman,

248
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:45,172
tell us, what should
we do to help?

249
00:09:46,517 --> 00:09:49,551
I heard him say he'll
pick her tomorrow at 2:00.

250
00:09:49,586 --> 00:09:51,079
We can go with Auntie
Vero so she finds out.

251
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,827
Mm-hmm.

252
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:52,793
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

253
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:53,827
- Hey, no!
- No.

254
00:09:53,862 --> 00:09:55,310
- Leave me out of this.
- Mm-hmm.

255
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,172
This is insane.

256
00:09:56,206 --> 00:09:57,827
I want no part of this.

257
00:09:57,862 --> 00:09:58,689
Do you understand?

258
00:09:58,724 --> 00:09:59,655
Count me out.

259
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:00,827
Did you think about this?

260
00:10:00,862 --> 00:10:02,275
Pokua, she's right.

261
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,137
That's such a...

262
00:10:03,172 --> 00:10:04,344
That's an awful idea.

263
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:06,103
That's the only
thing on my mind.

264
00:10:06,137 --> 00:10:07,517
I don't know how
to give her proof.

265
00:10:07,551 --> 00:10:10,413
But maybe there's something else

266
00:10:10,448 --> 00:10:11,344
we can do.

267
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:12,827
Okay, okay, okay.

268
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,344
How do we get proof?

269
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:17,551
Pokua,

270
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:21,034
do you know what
you're asking for?

271
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:22,379
Yes, I do.

272
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:24,827
Are you that heartless?

273
00:10:24,862 --> 00:10:26,724
No, I am not!

274
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:28,103
I am not.

275
00:10:28,137 --> 00:10:29,320
How did we even become friends?

276
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:30,517
Babs!

277
00:10:30,551 --> 00:10:31,734
Oh, oh, you too, you
agree with this, eh?

278
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:35,172
Not entirely, but you
people shouting and screaming,

279
00:10:35,206 --> 00:10:36,689
it's not going to
solve anything.

280
00:10:36,724 --> 00:10:38,724
Just bring your voices down.

281
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:40,137
Okay.

282
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:43,034
I understand how this
is a problem for you.

283
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:44,413
I can handle it myself.

284
00:10:44,448 --> 00:10:46,000
Help is all I want to give.

285
00:10:47,137 --> 00:10:47,793
Pokua!

286
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:48,827
I'll go.

287
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,689
She's right.

288
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:54,206
I mean, it's gonna cause
a whole lot of drama

289
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:56,413
and you don't want that scene.

290
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,068
But I have an idea.

291
00:10:59,103 --> 00:11:01,275
I mean, if it's really
going to help her,

292
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:04,034
maybe we can just
record him secretly.

293
00:11:04,068 --> 00:11:06,137
If we get him like once
or twice on camera,

294
00:11:06,172 --> 00:11:06,827
that's proof, right?

295
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:08,172
Hmm.

296
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:09,137
Hmm.

297
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:10,310
You have money for camera?

298
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:11,275
Oh, we can use our phone camera.

299
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,389
Our phone camera will be fine.

300
00:11:12,413 --> 00:11:13,517
And that easy, right?

301
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:14,689
Just gonna record him?

302
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:17,241
It was just a
suggestion, like...

303
00:11:17,275 --> 00:11:18,689
Hmm.

304
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:21,551
Okay, if you wish not to
be in, fine, we carry on.

305
00:11:21,586 --> 00:11:22,586
Baaba? Baab?

306
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,758
Baaba?

307
00:11:24,793 --> 00:11:26,827
See, look, eh,

308
00:11:26,862 --> 00:11:27,827
my next friendship, yeah,

309
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:30,137
I'm going to make sure
that there's a contract

310
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:33,413
so I can get out whenever I
feel like it without any guilt.

311
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:34,700
Ah, this friendship
thing is hard.

312
00:11:34,724 --> 00:11:36,689
And now by force, I have
to go and do this thing

313
00:11:36,724 --> 00:11:37,758
and I don't want to do.

314
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:38,689
No!

315
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:39,827
Next time, I'm serious,

316
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:42,206
we are signing contracts
so I can get out.

317
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:43,275
It's okay.

318
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,793
And this better be worth it.

319
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:48,689
.

320
00:11:48,724 --> 00:11:51,827
Go!

321
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:52,827
Guys!

322
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:54,137
Hey, I want the front.

323
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,103
I want the front.

324
00:11:55,137 --> 00:11:56,551
Give me the front!

325
00:11:56,586 --> 00:11:57,586
Front!

326
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:19,103
V, what is going on here?

327
00:12:19,862 --> 00:12:21,413
What's happening?

328
00:12:26,068 --> 00:12:27,068
Jesus.

329
00:12:31,862 --> 00:12:34,172
Stand here and talk to me.

330
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:38,172
V, look at you.

331
00:12:40,724 --> 00:12:43,275
Sweetheart, what has you
working you up like this?

332
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,689
Are you cheating on me?

333
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:49,172
What?

334
00:12:54,586 --> 00:12:56,689
Oh, ,

335
00:12:56,724 --> 00:12:58,103
.

336
00:12:58,137 --> 00:13:00,655
Sweetheart, did
you just ask that?

337
00:13:01,827 --> 00:13:02,758
I've lost count
of the many times

338
00:13:02,793 --> 00:13:03,620
you've asked this question.

339
00:13:03,655 --> 00:13:05,517
Just answer me.

340
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,482
Are you cheating?

341
00:13:06,517 --> 00:13:08,275
No!

342
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,551
How could I?

343
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:11,551
Never.

344
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,724
Tell me, where from this?

345
00:13:14,758 --> 00:13:17,275
, I told you

346
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,034
that the next time
I get a report

347
00:13:19,068 --> 00:13:21,551
that you're cheating on
me, I won't ask for proof,

348
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:23,034
I will just walk away.

349
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,758
Too many people can't be
reporting the same lie.

350
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:27,689
It's just not possible.

351
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,275
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

352
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,000
Sweetheart, it means someone
came to report me again?

353
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:34,034
I see.

354
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:35,251
And are you breaking your mind

355
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:37,551
because of what
you have not seen?

356
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:39,068
Goodness!

357
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:41,206
I've asked you to stop
listening to people

358
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:43,034
because they envy our marriage.

359
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:44,424
In case you want
to walk out of this

360
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,724
maybe 'cause you are tired
of me, then so be it,

361
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:52,137
but don't blame it
on unfounded hearsay.

362
00:13:52,172 --> 00:13:54,655
Sweetie, when I step out there,

363
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:56,551
there are a lot of pretty girls,

364
00:13:56,586 --> 00:14:01,413
even some of them are married
women who try to hit on me

365
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:03,310
but I refuse them.

366
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:04,448
You know why?

367
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:07,448
It's because I
respect our marriage.

368
00:14:09,862 --> 00:14:12,275
Unless I forget, what
do we have for dinner?

369
00:14:32,862 --> 00:14:34,172
This is the plan,

370
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,689
the two of you will
do the recording.

371
00:14:35,724 --> 00:14:38,413
I can't be part,
he'll recognize me.

372
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:42,551
When his car arrives, walk
towards it and pretend to chat.

373
00:14:42,586 --> 00:14:44,137
But hold on.

374
00:14:44,172 --> 00:14:46,620
So how would you have pulled
this off if we pulled out?

375
00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:47,827
I haven't thought about that.

376
00:14:47,862 --> 00:14:49,310
I know you'll never leave me.

377
00:14:49,344 --> 00:14:50,620
Hmm?

378
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:52,275
The lady will come from here.

379
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,655
Turn your backs towards them
and hold your phones casually.

380
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:57,206
No direct cameras.

381
00:14:57,241 --> 00:14:58,689
See, this thing is very risky.

382
00:14:58,724 --> 00:15:00,620
I can't believe we're
about to do this.

383
00:15:00,655 --> 00:15:02,320
I can't believe I got
myself involved in this.

384
00:15:02,344 --> 00:15:03,724
Baaba!

385
00:15:03,758 --> 00:15:05,724
I thought we all agreed
that we're gonna do this.

386
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:07,379
And I'm not saying
I'm pulling out,

387
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:09,586
I'm just telling
you that it's risky.

388
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,137
He's here.

389
00:15:11,172 --> 00:15:12,172
He's here.

390
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:15,413
And Fella, you first.
Okay.

391
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:16,448
Let's go.

392
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:20,758
Baaba?

393
00:15:20,793 --> 00:15:21,862
Yeah?

394
00:15:21,896 --> 00:15:23,696
When the lady's approaching
the car, call her,

395
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:27,655
she'll stop, get closer
and start a conversation.

396
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:29,275
Okay.

397
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,137
Get closer.

398
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:31,137
Get closer.

399
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:34,379
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm going. I'm going.

400
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,551
Fella!

401
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:38,586
Baabs!

402
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,241
Oh my goodness!

403
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,103
How are you?

404
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:44,034
I'm great.

405
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,241
Baabs, how long has it been?

406
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:47,172
Ah, it's been a very long time.

407
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:48,655
- Many years.
- Yes!

408
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:51,413
You're looking good.

409
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:53,208
Oh, thank you, it's
through the grace of God.

410
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:54,241
Oh, gosh.

411
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:00,034
- Yeah, okay-
- Yeah.

412
00:16:00,068 --> 00:16:01,241
So I came for a walk.

413
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:02,103
A walk?

414
00:16:02,137 --> 00:16:03,034
Yes.

415
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:04,448
Yes, it's very breezy, yeah.

416
00:16:04,482 --> 00:16:06,206
Yeah, it's nice, plenty birds-

417
00:16:06,241 --> 00:16:07,103
Yeah.

418
00:16:07,137 --> 00:16:08,206
- Lots of air.
- Oh.

419
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:09,172
Yeah.

420
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:10,551
- Ah.
- Oh, Fella!

421
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:13,551
Baabs, oh.

422
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:14,413
Yeah, Fella.

423
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:15,586
It's good to see you.

424
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,838
- Oh, good to see you too.
- Yeah.

425
00:16:16,862 --> 00:16:18,448
Good to see you.

426
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:20,724
Baabs.

427
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,689
What?

428
00:16:22,724 --> 00:16:24,172
- They kissed.
- They what?

429
00:16:24,206 --> 00:16:25,355
No, no, no, no, no, not here.

430
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:26,275
Where did they kiss?

431
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,206
On the lips, mwah, mwah.

432
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:28,172
On the lips?
Really?

433
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:29,206
- Mm-hmm.
- What-

434
00:16:35,103 --> 00:16:36,241
They kissed.

435
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:39,448
And look.

436
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:42,068
They kissed!

437
00:16:46,862 --> 00:16:50,827
Auntie Vero, we caught
him, your husband.

438
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:52,517
We have a proof of him cheating.

439
00:16:53,724 --> 00:16:55,103
Why are you doing this?

440
00:16:55,827 --> 00:16:57,137
I'm a wife too.

441
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:00,734
I can't stand the torture of
hearing my husband is cheating.

442
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:04,655
I thought I should expose
him to free your conscience.

443
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:08,137
I don't like it when you
see wrong and go quiet.

444
00:17:14,379 --> 00:17:15,620
Let me see it.

445
00:17:15,655 --> 00:17:17,724
Okay, okay, show, show.

446
00:17:21,172 --> 00:17:22,379
Looking good.

447
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:23,493
Oh, thank you, it's
through the grace of God.

448
00:17:23,517 --> 00:17:25,689
Oh, God.

449
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:30,103
Auntie Vero?

450
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,379
- For a walk.
- A walk?

451
00:17:32,413 --> 00:17:36,137
- Yeah.
- Please, are you okay?

452
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:37,310
Plenty birds, yeah.

453
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:43,275
Yeah.

454
00:17:44,413 --> 00:17:48,689
Auntie Vero,
please say something.

455
00:17:48,724 --> 00:17:49,838
Do you think we made her cry?

456
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:52,068
No.
She decided to cry on her own.

457
00:17:52,103 --> 00:17:55,413
She saw a video of her
husband cheating and cried.

458
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:57,103
Look, look guys, let's just...

459
00:17:57,137 --> 00:17:58,551
Let's just go, okay?

460
00:17:58,586 --> 00:18:00,724
I mean, clearly the woman
is in a lot of pain,

461
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:02,379
let's give her some space.

462
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:03,551
This was a bad idea.

463
00:18:07,413 --> 00:18:11,724
Here, have this.

464
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,137
What for?

465
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:20,344
It's your reward.

466
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:21,379
Oh, no, no, no.

467
00:18:21,413 --> 00:18:25,241
No, Auntie Vero, you
don't have to pay us.

468
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:26,655
Mm-hmm.

469
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:30,206
You know, anyone could
have done this for me too.

470
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:34,551
I've been so unhappy
the past three years,

471
00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:37,482
so thank you
for giving me this freedom.

472
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:43,482
I'm just tired of
living in oblivion.

473
00:18:45,103 --> 00:18:46,103
And here,

474
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:49,379
put the video on this.

475
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:53,310
Just put it on.

476
00:19:00,689 --> 00:19:02,517
- Miss, we are so sorry.
- Sorry, Auntie Vero.

477
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:04,034
We're sorry.

478
00:19:04,068 --> 00:19:05,655
Thank you,
through the grace of God.

479
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,482
We may go now.

480
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:11,655
We shouldn't of done this.

481
00:19:11,689 --> 00:19:12,586
Oh, okay.

482
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,758
So I came for a walk.

483
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:16,068
- A walk?
- Yes.

484
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:19,034
It's nice, plenty birds-

485
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:20,206
- Yeah.
- Lots of air.

486
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:21,724
- Oh!
- Yeah.

487
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:47,172
V?

488
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:57,137
V!

489
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:03,758
V for Vero.

490
00:20:08,586 --> 00:20:09,586
V!

491
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,034
Honey, I'm home!

492
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:17,000
Where's this wife?

493
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,758
VV!

494
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:23,586
V, darling!

495
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,620
Ah.

496
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,655
Thank you,
through the grace of God.

497
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,310
Oh, gosh.

498
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,689
- Yeah, okay-
- Yeah.

499
00:21:04,724 --> 00:21:06,068
So I came for a walk.

500
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:07,103
- A walk?
- Yes.

501
00:21:07,137 --> 00:21:09,034
Yes, it's very breezy, yeah.

502
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,551
Yeah, it's nice,
there's plenty birds-

503
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:12,172
- Yeah.
- Lots of-

504
00:21:12,206 --> 00:21:13,355
♪ Get it, get it, get it,
get it, get it, get it ♪

505
00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:15,448
This is a lot of money.

506
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,620
Yeah, it is.

507
00:21:20,241 --> 00:21:22,137
We should split it.

508
00:21:22,172 --> 00:21:24,137
Yeah, everybody takes their cut.

509
00:21:24,172 --> 00:21:25,458
I mean, whatever you wanna do
with it is your business, but-

510
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:26,310
No, no, no.

511
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:27,655
No, no.

512
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:30,310
Let's open a proper
ushering agency,

513
00:21:30,344 --> 00:21:31,838
you know, with a registered
office and everything.

514
00:21:31,862 --> 00:21:33,724
Think about it, Pokbafell.

515
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:38,655
Vuh.
The F is silent.

516
00:21:38,689 --> 00:21:39,586
Vuh.

517
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,206
You know what, it makes sense.

518
00:21:41,241 --> 00:21:42,517
Yeah.

519
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,068
Pokua, are you here?

520
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:45,827
Of course, I'm here.

521
00:21:45,862 --> 00:21:47,758
Okay, so what's your take?

522
00:21:47,793 --> 00:21:49,724
I think I need some
time to think through.

523
00:21:49,758 --> 00:21:52,172
Okay, let's all take
some time to think through.

524
00:21:52,206 --> 00:21:53,413
Yep.

525
00:21:53,448 --> 00:21:55,172
But you know what?
I think it's perfect.

526
00:21:55,206 --> 00:21:56,206
Yes!

527
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:10,862
Ow!

528
00:22:28,517 --> 00:22:30,034
Honey?

529
00:22:30,068 --> 00:22:31,172
Get my phone!

530
00:22:36,758 --> 00:22:37,758
Yeah.

531
00:22:41,758 --> 00:22:43,275
Um-mm.
Not ready.

532
00:22:44,586 --> 00:22:46,517
Hi, is this Pokua?

533
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:47,379
That smells good.

534
00:22:47,413 --> 00:22:48,413
Shh, shh.

535
00:22:49,517 --> 00:22:51,413
Yes, Pokua here.

536
00:22:51,448 --> 00:22:52,551
Vero tells me you helped her

537
00:22:52,586 --> 00:22:54,137
catch her cheating husband.

538
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:55,689
Can you help me too?

539
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,482
Pardon?

540
00:22:58,517 --> 00:22:59,769
I suspect my
husband is cheating.

541
00:22:59,793 --> 00:23:02,034
I want proof to face him.

542
00:23:03,172 --> 00:23:04,689
A friend also suspects
her boyfriend,

543
00:23:04,724 --> 00:23:06,413
she needs your help.

544
00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:09,379
Hello?

545
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:12,068
Hello?

546
00:23:12,103 --> 00:23:13,793
No, no, no way!

547
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:15,734
No way we're getting into
something like that, Pokua.

548
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:16,689
No!

549
00:23:16,724 --> 00:23:18,241
I told you she was crazy.

550
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:19,275
Did you believe me?

551
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,551
No, I am not.

552
00:23:21,586 --> 00:23:22,620
Come on guys.

553
00:23:22,655 --> 00:23:24,655
Okay, look at it this way,

554
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:27,034
if we treat this as business,

555
00:23:27,068 --> 00:23:29,379
we are going to expose a
lot of cheating husbands

556
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:30,586
and boyfriends.

557
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,379
And if they pay for our
service, it's a lot of money.

558
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,413
Think about it.

559
00:23:37,137 --> 00:23:38,517
Lots of money to make.

560
00:23:41,448 --> 00:23:44,241
Then what happens to Pokbafell?

561
00:23:46,137 --> 00:23:49,551
The ushered business
is nothing to us.

562
00:23:49,586 --> 00:23:51,413
It makes us nothing.

563
00:23:51,448 --> 00:23:54,137
For how long?
We just keep trying.

564
00:23:54,172 --> 00:23:55,586
We need to try
something different.

565
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,482
And getting into
people's private lives,

566
00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:59,551
that's your solution, Pokua?

567
00:23:59,586 --> 00:24:01,379
I mean, what kind
of job is that?

568
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:03,068
What?

569
00:24:03,103 --> 00:24:05,068
Our work will be very simple.

570
00:24:05,103 --> 00:24:07,172
If you suspect your
partner is cheating on you,

571
00:24:07,206 --> 00:24:09,517
just tell us about it.

572
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:11,689
We give you a proof, you pay us.

573
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:15,827
Easy, huh?

574
00:24:15,862 --> 00:24:16,827
Easy, huh?

575
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:18,482
It doesn't sound easy, huh?

576
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:19,517
Not one bit, huh?

577
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:23,551
You know what I think?

578
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,172
I mean, she's crazy.

579
00:24:27,206 --> 00:24:28,206
She's insane-o

580
00:24:29,724 --> 00:24:30,724
but...

581
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,413
I'm game.

582
00:24:34,448 --> 00:24:36,448
I mean, we don't
have a choice, right?

583
00:24:37,448 --> 00:24:38,793
Yeah, me too.

584
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:41,172
I mean, if it's going to
make us money, let's do it.

585
00:24:41,206 --> 00:24:42,724
- Yeah!
- Brilliant!

586
00:24:42,758 --> 00:24:43,838
Going after the side chicks.

587
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:45,034
- Yes!
- Mm-hmm.

588
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:45,827
- Get the bad ones.
- Yeah.

589
00:24:45,862 --> 00:24:47,517
We're the good cops.

590
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:48,758
It's so funny.

591
00:24:48,793 --> 00:24:52,689
Maybe we can name it
Side Chick Task Force?

592
00:24:52,724 --> 00:24:53,793
Huh?

593
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:55,413
That don't sound...

594
00:24:55,448 --> 00:24:56,655
Why is there a police unit?

595
00:24:56,689 --> 00:24:58,172
- What else?
- Wait, wait.

596
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,206
Let me think.

597
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,551
Instead of task force,

598
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,137
let's put gang.

599
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:06,620
Yes!

600
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:07,482
Gang!

601
00:25:07,517 --> 00:25:09,413
SideChic Gang!

602
00:25:09,448 --> 00:25:10,413
- Pa-pow!
- Poo-ooh!

603
00:25:10,448 --> 00:25:11,275
Pa-pow!

604
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,551
SideChic Gang.

605
00:25:12,586 --> 00:25:14,034
Okay, good.

606
00:25:14,068 --> 00:25:14,827
SideChic Gang.

607
00:25:14,862 --> 00:25:15,689
Wait, let me help you.

608
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:17,137
SideChic Gang.

609
00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:18,586
Draah! Draah!

610
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,413
Skraah!

611
00:25:20,448 --> 00:25:21,517
Go, go.

612
00:25:21,551 --> 00:25:22,379
Is it...
Is it...

613
00:25:22,413 --> 00:25:23,413
Yes, it is.

614
00:25:23,448 --> 00:25:24,275
Okay.

615
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,137
Okay.

616
00:25:25,172 --> 00:25:27,793
Now, office supplies.

617
00:25:27,827 --> 00:25:28,827
Yeah.

618
00:25:31,827 --> 00:25:32,689
Two cameras.

619
00:25:32,724 --> 00:25:33,793
Hmm, and a printer.

620
00:25:33,827 --> 00:25:36,310
Papers and stamps.

621
00:25:36,344 --> 00:25:39,793
Office table, office chairs, TV?

622
00:25:39,827 --> 00:25:40,655
- TV.
- Yes.

623
00:25:40,689 --> 00:25:41,724
Office chair.

624
00:25:41,758 --> 00:25:42,827
And a fan.

625
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:44,034
No, no, AC.

626
00:25:44,068 --> 00:25:44,724
But wait, wait, wait.

627
00:25:44,758 --> 00:25:46,551
Pokua, wait.

628
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,379
I mean, I think we should
hold on on this list.

629
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:50,413
Why?

630
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:52,137
Get an office first.

631
00:25:56,758 --> 00:25:57,793
Too expensive.

632
00:26:20,862 --> 00:26:22,310
Guys, guys.

633
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:25,068
Hurry up.

634
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,620
For rent.

635
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,068
Oh.

636
00:26:32,448 --> 00:26:37,448
03-02-123-231.

637
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:47,068
Hello. Hi.

638
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,034
We saw a structure
you're renting.

639
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:51,068
We want it.

640
00:27:01,482 --> 00:27:02,482
Okay.

641
00:27:13,103 --> 00:27:15,655
What do you think they do there?

642
00:27:15,689 --> 00:27:19,689
I think they find
young girls for old men.

643
00:27:19,724 --> 00:27:24,103
Eh?

644
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:52,482
Hi, welcome.

645
00:27:52,517 --> 00:27:54,275
Thank you.

646
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:56,137
How may I assist you?

647
00:27:57,413 --> 00:28:01,413
Well, I am told you
arrange young, sweet looking,

648
00:28:01,448 --> 00:28:03,448
beautiful girls for old men.

649
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:06,068
Can you help me?

650
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:08,172
And who told you that?

651
00:28:09,172 --> 00:28:10,551
My friend.

652
00:28:15,517 --> 00:28:19,103
I'm sorry,

653
00:28:19,137 --> 00:28:21,103
we don't offer
such services here.

654
00:28:21,137 --> 00:28:22,689
Oh.
So, what do you do?

655
00:28:22,724 --> 00:28:27,172
We help women catch
their cheating husbands.

656
00:28:28,172 --> 00:28:31,551
Yes, like the side chick police.

657
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:35,793
Oh, sorry, my friend lied to me.

658
00:28:35,827 --> 00:28:37,275
I apologize for that.

659
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:44,103
But you see in case you
start my kind of service,

660
00:28:44,137 --> 00:28:45,137
remember me.

661
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:50,827
You look great.
Yes.

662
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:51,724
Goodbye.

663
00:28:51,758 --> 00:28:52,586
Bye-bye.

664
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,620
Bye.

665
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:03,724
Hi.

666
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,310
Welcome.

667
00:29:07,689 --> 00:29:09,068
Hi, we spoke, yeah.

668
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:14,137
I'm Vero's friend.

669
00:29:14,172 --> 00:29:15,241
You directed me here.

670
00:29:16,275 --> 00:29:17,275
Oh, yeah.

671
00:29:20,137 --> 00:29:21,620
Nice to have you.

672
00:29:21,655 --> 00:29:23,068
These are my colleagues.

673
00:29:26,862 --> 00:29:27,862
Hi.

674
00:29:29,448 --> 00:29:30,758
I'm told you can help me.

675
00:29:30,793 --> 00:29:31,793
Is that true?

676
00:29:32,827 --> 00:29:36,137
Well, it depends
on what you need.

677
00:29:36,172 --> 00:29:37,172
Please have a seat.

678
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,310
Here.

679
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:52,068
Talk to us.
How may we help you?

680
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:56,586
I'm a career woman
married to a politician.

681
00:29:58,103 --> 00:30:02,275
He used to accuse me of not
having time for our marriage.

682
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,758
I didn't want to lose him.

683
00:30:04,793 --> 00:30:07,758
So I changed jobs to
a less demanding one

684
00:30:07,793 --> 00:30:09,379
just to create time.

685
00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:13,379
But now I feel he's the one
who's denying me attention.

686
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:15,379
He doesn't touch me anymore.

687
00:30:16,655 --> 00:30:18,689
Always acting tired.

688
00:30:18,724 --> 00:30:21,482
I refuse to believe that
he was cheating on me

689
00:30:21,517 --> 00:30:23,724
even when I found condoms hidden

690
00:30:23,758 --> 00:30:25,793
that's where his spare tire is,

691
00:30:25,827 --> 00:30:27,482
I blamed the mechanic.

692
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:31,586
Last night he didn't come home.

693
00:30:33,344 --> 00:30:35,551
I called him this morning.

694
00:30:35,586 --> 00:30:38,034
He said he went on
an impromptu trip.

695
00:30:38,068 --> 00:30:39,310
He'll be back tomorrow.

696
00:30:39,344 --> 00:30:42,275
His phone went off, that's why
he couldn't call to tell me.

697
00:30:43,448 --> 00:30:47,034
An hour later, a friend
called to tell me that

698
00:30:48,172 --> 00:30:50,689
she saw my husband's
car drive past her area.

699
00:30:52,689 --> 00:30:54,068
Shocking, huh?

700
00:30:55,862 --> 00:31:01,034
You know, I've been
crying since that moment.

701
00:31:02,241 --> 00:31:03,275
You need water?

702
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:04,517
Fella, get her water.

703
00:31:04,551 --> 00:31:06,103
No.

704
00:31:06,137 --> 00:31:08,379
I'm fine.

705
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:11,551
Now I'm convinced
he's cheating on me.

706
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:12,586
I need help.

707
00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:15,793
Would you help me?

708
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:28,206
- Do you have his pictures?
- Yeah.

709
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:33,241
Yes.

710
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,551
Here.

711
00:31:35,586 --> 00:31:39,344
Fill in all your details and
your husband's office address,

712
00:31:39,379 --> 00:31:40,379
okay?

713
00:31:57,275 --> 00:32:00,275
.

714
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,310
It will cost you.

715
00:32:02,344 --> 00:32:04,000
How much are we talking about?

716
00:32:04,862 --> 00:32:06,413
I have 10,000 on offer.

717
00:32:11,827 --> 00:32:13,137
- Oh, oh.
- Okay.

718
00:32:13,172 --> 00:32:15,310
Oh, all right, I
mean, we can manage.

719
00:32:16,172 --> 00:32:17,172
Right.

720
00:32:23,206 --> 00:32:24,827
That's about half of the money.

721
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:27,241
When the job is
done, I pay the rest.

722
00:32:27,275 --> 00:32:28,551
Oh, fine.

723
00:32:29,551 --> 00:32:31,379
I count on you.

724
00:32:31,413 --> 00:32:32,413
Please help me.

725
00:32:33,482 --> 00:32:34,482
Don't worry.

726
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:35,827
Thank you.

727
00:32:35,862 --> 00:32:37,655
So ladies, I'll show
you some of the best

728
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,551
collections we have
here in this garage.

729
00:32:39,586 --> 00:32:41,310
You see this one,
this white car?

730
00:32:41,344 --> 00:32:43,068
It came in just last week

731
00:32:43,103 --> 00:32:45,724
and it is just 45K, just.

732
00:32:45,758 --> 00:32:48,586
And then this one, this
one, this black one,

733
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,689
it arrived just yesterday.

734
00:32:50,724 --> 00:32:51,724
Yeah!
.

suspect he has started again.

up with her and come for me.

out if they've broken up

Don't work for men?

I know.

999
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:44,827
But I'll offer any amount

You have to save me.

1002
00:58:52,310 --> 00:58:53,310
Have a seat.

1003
00:59:03,379 --> 00:59:04,379
Talk to us.

1004
00:59:05,758 --> 00:59:07,241
I'm a mining engineer.

1005
00:59:08,517 --> 00:59:10,241
I deal in gold and bauxite.

1006
00:59:11,793 --> 00:59:15,413
I've been dating my
fiance for two years.

1007
00:59:15,448 --> 00:59:17,310
We decided to marry next year.

1008
00:59:19,344 --> 00:59:21,586
I have bought
everything for her,

1009
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,448
anything she's asked for.

1010
00:59:23,482 --> 00:59:28,379
She uses two cars, has her
own house, supermarket,

1011
00:59:28,413 --> 00:59:30,620
all from my account.

1012
00:59:33,413 --> 00:59:37,551
See, I just thought she
would just focus on me.

1013
00:59:38,862 --> 00:59:42,793
But no, she acts weird
and she's never satisfied.

1014
00:59:44,379 --> 00:59:47,275
She never answers my
call on the first ring.

1015
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:50,241
And even when she
does, she whispers.

1016
00:59:51,172 --> 00:59:52,310
Why would she do that?

1017
00:59:53,827 --> 00:59:55,586
I suspect she's
seeing another man.

1018
00:59:58,310 --> 01:00:00,217
You see, I don't care how
much money I've spent on her,

1019
01:00:00,241 --> 01:00:02,172
on the man she's seeing,

1020
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:04,793
I just want to be
sure she's cheating.

1021
01:00:07,724 --> 01:00:09,310
I wanna be free and walk away.

1022
01:00:11,586 --> 01:00:14,724

1023
01:00:20,551 --> 01:00:21,551

find out your requirements.

1041

I wouldn't use my car too.

1042

01:03:10,448 --> 01:03:12,172
Why are you following me?

1051
01:03:12,206 --> 01:03:14,413
Oh, who are you?

1052
01:03:16,413 --> 01:03:17,275
Heh?
Hmm.

1053
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:18,310
What do you want?

1054
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:23,310
Look, I've heard about you
girls in the green ride.

1055

Girls in the green ride?

1056
01:03:28,586 --> 01:03:29,655
There must be a mistake.

1058
01:03:30,551 --> 01:03:32,103
We are girls-

1059
01:03:32,137 --> 01:03:33,758
- Girls on the road.
- Yeah.

1060
01:03:33,793 --> 01:03:34,793
Girls on the road.

Ooh, yeah.

1062
01:03:36,724 --> 01:03:39,689
Girls on the road.

1063
01:03:39,724 --> 01:03:41,172

1064
01:03:41,206 --> 01:03:43,137
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1065
01:03:43,172 --> 01:03:45,482
I mean, that's gone too far.

1066
01:03:45,517 --> 01:03:47,413
I mean, what would
make you think that?

1067
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:49,827
So why did you
stop when I stopped?

1068
01:03:49,862 --> 01:03:51,137
Slow down, sorry.

1069
01:03:51,172 --> 01:03:52,551
Ooh, ooh, ou-ou-...
We s-

1070
01:03:52,586 --> 01:03:54,413
Our engine broke down
a- and the car stopped

1071
01:03:54,448 --> 01:03:55,448
a- and we stopped.

1072
01:03:55,482 --> 01:03:56,655
Yes.

1073
01:03:56,689 --> 01:03:58,689
You know, this is a
Lancia, so...

1074
01:03:58,724 --> 01:04:01,448
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1075
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:09,034
.

1076
01:04:09,068 --> 01:04:10,068
Hmm.

1077
01:04:30,724 --> 01:04:31,586
This is screwed!

1078
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:32,620
Damn!

1079
01:04:33,724 --> 01:04:34,551
Damn.

1080
01:04:34,586 --> 01:04:35,551
Damn it.

1081
01:04:35,586 --> 01:04:36,586
We need spice.

1082
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:37,793
What for?

1083
01:04:37,827 --> 01:04:39,068
For tip off.

1084
01:04:39,103 --> 01:04:40,827
We can't be following
her like that,

1085
01:04:40,862 --> 01:04:43,551
it will ruin everything.

1086
01:04:43,586 --> 01:04:45,689
Pokua, that means more money.

1087
01:04:45,724 --> 01:04:46,655
More money,

1088
01:04:46,689 --> 01:04:48,275
where are we gonna get it from?

1089
01:04:52,275 --> 01:04:54,689
I doubled the amounts
to speed up the process.

1090
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:56,827
I hope it pays off.

1091
01:04:56,862 --> 01:04:58,689
Do you need some more
pictures for this?

1092
01:04:58,724 --> 01:05:01,103
Oh, no, no, don't worry,
we just want copies of the

1093
01:05:01,137 --> 01:05:02,413
old ones we have.

1094
01:05:02,448 --> 01:05:03,379
Okay.

1095
01:05:03,413 --> 01:05:04,275
Can I ask you a question?

1096
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:05,482
Sure.

1097
01:05:05,517 --> 01:05:07,379
I mean, why wouldn't
she use one of the cars

1098
01:05:07,413 --> 01:05:09,068
that you bought her?

1099
01:05:09,103 --> 01:05:10,448
Excuse me?

1100
01:05:10,482 --> 01:05:13,310
Yes, I mean, she hired a taxi.

1101
01:05:13,344 --> 01:05:15,586
She's in to hiding, she
doesn't want me to find out.

1102
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,103
- Oh yeah, I figured.
- Oh.

1103
01:05:17,137 --> 01:05:18,379
That's smart.

1104
01:05:18,413 --> 01:05:19,655
You'll hear from us.

1105
01:05:19,689 --> 01:05:20,517
I count on you.

1106
01:05:20,551 --> 01:05:21,551
Yeah.

1107
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:28,689
We got spice at
the west and east.

1108
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:31,724
We're targeting hotels,
restaurants, and guest house.

1109
01:05:33,241 --> 01:05:34,689
Please hold on. Mr. Sefa.

1110
01:05:38,586 --> 01:05:39,586
Hello?

1111
01:05:40,793 --> 01:05:41,655
Hello?

1112
01:05:41,689 --> 01:05:42,724
Hello.

1113
01:05:42,758 --> 01:05:44,413
I just saw your target.

1114
01:05:44,448 --> 01:05:46,551
Just checked into our hotel.

1115
01:05:46,586 --> 01:05:49,241
.

1116
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:52,275
Okay.
Thank you very much.

1117
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:53,310
Thank you.

1118
01:05:54,068 --> 01:05:55,724
Can I call you back, Mr. Sefa?

1119
01:05:57,448 --> 01:05:58,827
Thank you.

1120
01:05:58,862 --> 01:06:01,172
Ladies, we have a tip off!

1121
01:06:34,172 --> 01:06:34,827
Ooh!

1122
01:06:34,862 --> 01:06:35,862
It's good you're here.

1123
01:06:35,896 --> 01:06:38,206
I just went in there,
there in the bathroom

1124
01:06:38,241 --> 01:06:40,206
and.

1125
01:06:40,241 --> 01:06:41,137
Room one.

1126
01:06:41,172 --> 01:06:43,034
- This has-
- Shh, shh, shh!

1127
01:07:26,482 --> 01:07:27,310
Calm, honey.

1128
01:07:27,344 --> 01:07:28,689
Honey, calm down.

1129
01:07:28,724 --> 01:07:31,620
I- It's not what it looks
like, I can explain.

1130
01:07:31,655 --> 01:07:32,655
Eh.

1131
01:07:34,172 --> 01:07:35,172
I can explain.

1132
01:07:35,206 --> 01:07:36,034
?

1133
01:07:36,068 --> 01:07:37,068
What?

1134
01:07:45,068 --> 01:07:46,448
Honey, listen, listen.

1135
01:07:46,482 --> 01:07:47,413
Honey, listen.

1136
01:07:47,448 --> 01:07:48,275
Calm down.

1137
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:49,310
Honey, wait.

1138
01:07:51,551 --> 01:07:53,379
Wait, wait.

1139
01:07:53,413 --> 01:07:54,551
Calm down.

1140
01:07:54,586 --> 01:07:55,482
I can explain, it's
not what it looks like!

1141
01:07:55,517 --> 01:07:57,206
Honey, wait, wait!

1142
01:08:39,103 --> 01:08:40,103
Thank you.

1143
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:43,137
Ex-excuse me?

1144
01:08:43,172 --> 01:08:44,689
Payment, please?

1145
01:08:44,724 --> 01:08:46,206
Oh, that.

1146
01:08:56,724 --> 01:09:01,724
Yeah, we're here.

1147
01:09:02,862 --> 01:09:04,689
Yeah, someone will
handle your payment.

1148
01:09:20,793 --> 01:09:23,103
Did you enjoy
seeing your husband

1149
01:09:23,137 --> 01:09:24,137
with another woman?

1150
01:09:28,448 --> 01:09:31,379
You are happy destroying
marriages for money.

1151
01:09:31,413 --> 01:09:34,103
We helped you find
your cheating husband.

1152
01:09:34,137 --> 01:09:35,758
You should pay us.

1153
01:09:35,793 --> 01:09:37,137
Is that not what you do?

1154
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:45,448
You see, that lady
is not my fiance.

1155
01:09:45,482 --> 01:09:46,482
I don't know her.

1156
01:09:48,724 --> 01:09:50,241
But thanks for your service.

1157
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:54,241
I admire your speed.

1158
01:09:55,137 --> 01:09:56,344
Have a good day.

1159
01:10:03,793 --> 01:10:05,517
O- okay.

1160
01:10:05,551 --> 01:10:06,551
Okay.
Hmm?

1161
01:10:08,172 --> 01:10:09,655
- It's okay?
- You okay?

1162
01:10:09,689 --> 01:10:11,310
Let's go back to.

1163
01:10:12,206 --> 01:10:13,413
Let's go, let's go.

1164
01:10:13,448 --> 01:10:14,562
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1165
01:10:14,586 --> 01:10:19,586
No, I'm fine.

1166
01:10:41,448 --> 01:10:42,482
Please, have a seat.

1167
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:56,241
So, talk to us.

1168
01:10:58,586 --> 01:11:02,551
I suspect my boyfriend

1169
01:11:02,586 --> 01:11:04,068
is cheating on me.

1170
01:11:04,103 --> 01:11:06,344
My friends say he
hangs out with a woman,

1171
01:11:06,379 --> 01:11:08,689
which obviously isn't me.

1172
01:11:08,724 --> 01:11:11,827
I can't remember the last
time we went out together.

1173
01:11:11,862 --> 01:11:13,724
It's been over a year.

1174
01:11:13,758 --> 01:11:15,137
Wow.

1175
01:11:15,172 --> 01:11:16,172
Mm-hmm.

1176
01:11:18,103 --> 01:11:19,482
I will need you to help me.

1177
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:26,517
I want to know if he's
seeing someone else.

1178
01:11:26,551 --> 01:11:30,310
Okay.

1179
01:11:42,275 --> 01:11:43,275
Are you okay?

1180
01:11:49,862 --> 01:11:50,862
Um...

1181
01:11:55,448 --> 01:11:57,413
Is-is-is this
your-your boyfriend?

1182
01:11:58,379 --> 01:11:59,379
Yes.

1183
01:12:00,344 --> 01:12:03,172
How long have you been together?

1184
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:06,586
Three years.

1185
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:07,620
Any problem?

1186
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:12,275
Um, no.
No problem.

1187
01:12:12,310 --> 01:12:15,344
This is just the regular
background check.

1188
01:12:16,827 --> 01:12:17,827
Oh.

1189
01:12:17,862 --> 01:12:19,689
So are you gonna help me?

1190
01:12:19,724 --> 01:12:21,103
- Yeah, sure.
- Hmm.

1191
01:12:21,862 --> 01:12:23,068
We'll help you.

1192
01:12:23,103 --> 01:12:24,275
Splendid.

1193
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:27,241
So I will await your feedback.

1194
01:12:35,068 --> 01:12:35,724
Baaba?

1195
01:12:35,758 --> 01:12:37,310
Hmm?

1196
01:12:37,344 --> 01:12:40,068
Hey, Baaba, there must be
some explanation to this.

1197
01:12:40,103 --> 01:12:42,275
No, it's hot.

1198
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:43,344
- Baaba?
- Hmm?

1199
01:12:45,275 --> 01:12:46,620
Oh, wow.

1200
01:12:46,655 --> 01:12:48,034
Babe, are you okay?

1201
01:12:48,068 --> 01:12:50,068
No, I'm fine.

1202
01:12:50,103 --> 01:12:51,413
Are you sure?

1203
01:12:51,448 --> 01:12:53,724
No, I'm very fine.

1204
01:13:05,103 --> 01:13:06,103

Maybe we should close
it down and move on.

01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:26,724

01:17:39,758 --> 01:17:43,758
I just needed you a little
more, but you were always gone.

1237
01:17:45,068 --> 01:17:47,793
I've been angry and I
even wanted to break up,

1238
01:17:49,275 --> 01:17:53,689
but I changed my thoughts
'cause I don't want to lose you.

1239
01:17:57,448 --> 01:18:00,689
A lot of things changed
when you started this

1240
01:18:00,724 --> 01:18:02,448
SideChic Gang business.

1241
01:18:04,241 --> 01:18:05,458
You leave home before I'm awake

1242
01:18:05,482 --> 01:18:07,517
and you return when I'm asleep.

1243
01:18:07,551 --> 01:18:11,137
I mean, it was just crazy
spending all those nights alone.

1244
01:18:11,172 --> 01:18:13,655
It almost felt like
I was single again.

1245
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,241
I was frustrated,

1246
01:18:15,275 --> 01:18:17,310
I couldn't concentrate at work,

1247
01:18:17,344 --> 01:18:20,206
so I started doing crazy stuff.

1248
01:18:20,241 --> 01:18:22,379
Howcome we never
spoke about this?

1249
01:18:25,344 --> 01:18:29,068
I didn't know how
you would take it.

1250
01:18:29,103 --> 01:18:33,172
My friends told me that's
how to calm myself down and

1251
01:18:34,068 --> 01:18:36,068
I listened to them.

1252
01:18:36,103 --> 01:18:37,310
I am so sorry.

1253
01:18:40,689 --> 01:18:42,034
I want my wife back.

I need you to spend a little
more time with me, please.

01:19:48,344 --> 01:19:51,310
So now you know why I'm
not responding to your calls

01:19:51,344 --> 01:19:52,344
and messages.

1260
01:19:53,275 --> 01:19:56,034
Maybe I got tired of
being a side chick.

1261
01:19:56,068 --> 01:19:58,448
I deserve a boyfriend
that's committed to me.

1262

01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:58,068

1281
01:22:25,482 --> 01:22:28,413
Is this what you want,

1282
01:22:28,448 --> 01:22:29,379
a break up?

1283
01:22:29,413 --> 01:22:30,724
That is the only thing left.

1284
01:22:30,758 --> 01:22:32,172
Look, I'm done with this.

1285
01:22:32,206 --> 01:22:34,275
I work so hard for us.

1286
01:22:34,310 --> 01:22:35,620
Oh, you think that is easy?

1287
01:22:35,655 --> 01:22:36,551
I work hard too.

1288
01:22:36,586 --> 01:22:38,034
Very hard.

1289
01:22:38,068 --> 01:22:39,482
But I still find time for you!

1290
01:22:39,517 --> 01:22:42,034
You are so obsessed
with yourself,

1291
01:22:42,068 --> 01:22:44,172
your work and the numerous
business meetings.

1292
01:22:44,206 --> 01:22:45,562
Maybe you should
start dating them.

1293
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:46,758
Mm-hmm.

1294
01:22:46,793 --> 01:22:48,413
They'll be better
girlfriends than me.

1295
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,448
I'm sorry!

1296
01:22:51,448 --> 01:22:54,413
So, so this is what
I deserve, right?

1297
01:22:59,655 --> 01:23:01,275
I have an idea.

1298
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:04,068
Girls, it took too
much courage for us

1299
01:23:04,103 --> 01:23:05,758
to set up SideChic Gang.

1300
01:23:05,793 --> 01:23:08,275
We can't just let it
die just like that.

1301
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:11,241
There must be something
that we can do different.

1302
01:23:11,275 --> 01:23:16,275
So, I was thinking that
instead of using SideChic Gang

1303
01:23:16,862 --> 01:23:18,448
to fight side chicks,

1304
01:23:18,482 --> 01:23:21,517
maybe we should use it to
counsel couples, you know,

1305
01:23:21,551 --> 01:23:24,034
to help them prevent it.

1306
01:23:27,413 --> 01:23:29,533
Look, I know we've had our
own share of harsh lessons,

1307
01:23:32,551 --> 01:23:34,586
but let's use our experiences.

1308
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:37,413
Let's use it to tell
these couples what to do

1309
01:23:37,448 --> 01:23:39,206
to keep their partners,

1310
01:23:39,241 --> 01:23:43,172
save their relationships,
their marriages, their homes,

1311
01:23:43,206 --> 01:23:47,137
and the end result, there'll
be no more need for side chicks

1312
01:23:47,172 --> 01:23:50,172
or side dudes or
anything like that.

1313
01:23:52,068 --> 01:23:54,586
So, what do you think?

1314
01:24:09,551 --> 01:24:12,034
Brilliant.

1315
01:24:12,068 --> 01:24:13,241
Yeah.

1316
01:24:13,275 --> 01:24:16,724
Come here.

1317
01:24:16,758 --> 01:24:20,448
Oh!

1318
01:24:20,482 --> 01:24:22,310
So, how may we help you?

1319
01:24:23,689 --> 01:24:26,206
My husband has not been
the man I married lately.

1320
01:24:26,241 --> 01:24:27,758
You know, so many
things changed.

1321
01:24:29,137 --> 01:24:31,551
I think he doesn't find
me attractive anymore.

1322
01:24:31,586 --> 01:24:34,517
I used to be the only thing
he ever dreamt of, but now,

1323
01:24:34,551 --> 01:24:36,068
he's unbothered.

1324
01:24:36,103 --> 01:24:38,241
I see why I don't exist.

1325
01:24:38,275 --> 01:24:39,724
It hurts.

1326
01:24:39,758 --> 01:24:40,758
Truly hurts.

1327
01:24:41,965 --> 01:24:45,241
I feel he's finding another
woman beautiful somewhere.

1328
01:24:46,586 --> 01:24:47,586
Please,

1329
01:24:48,517 --> 01:24:49,724
I need you to help me.

1330
01:24:51,206 --> 01:24:53,068
I want to know if there's
someone in his life.

1331
01:24:54,586 --> 01:24:56,379
What were the things
you did together

1332
01:24:56,413 --> 01:24:59,724
when you were the only
thing he needed in his life?

1333
01:24:59,758 --> 01:25:01,758
We even went to watch movies,

1334
01:25:01,793 --> 01:25:04,344
went on dinner
dates and shopping.

1335
01:25:04,379 --> 01:25:05,758
Why did that stop?

1336
01:25:05,793 --> 01:25:07,424
Well, personally, I
feel we were growing up

1337
01:25:07,448 --> 01:25:10,448
and it was time to leave
some of such things,

1338
01:25:10,482 --> 01:25:12,068
so I took a break.

1339
01:25:12,103 --> 01:25:15,827
So when's the last time he
said something nice to you?

1340
01:25:15,862 --> 01:25:16,862
Yesterday.

1341
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:19,551
Wait, wait, look.

1342
01:25:19,586 --> 01:25:23,275
It's nice if he means
the nice things he says

1343
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:24,517
and that's the problem.

1344
01:25:24,551 --> 01:25:29,137
And when was the last time
you said something nice to him?

1345
01:25:29,172 --> 01:25:30,172
Hmm...

1346
01:25:31,413 --> 01:25:33,068
I can't recall.

1347
01:25:33,103 --> 01:25:34,620
I can't remember.

1348
01:25:34,655 --> 01:25:35,655
Look, see,

1349
01:25:36,793 --> 01:25:39,689
my husband is very
annoying, trust me.

1350
01:25:39,724 --> 01:25:41,284
You wouldn't like him
when you meet him.

1351
01:25:41,310 --> 01:25:44,241
Anytime I thought to say
something nice, he ruined it.

1352
01:25:44,275 --> 01:25:45,793
What did he do?

1353
01:25:48,172 --> 01:25:49,172
Uh...

1354
01:25:50,172 --> 01:25:51,137
Are there that many?

1355
01:25:51,172 --> 01:25:52,655
Oh, yeah.
A lot of them.

1356
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:54,344
I can't even remember.

1357
01:25:54,379 --> 01:25:55,724
I can't even think of one.

1358
01:25:55,758 --> 01:25:57,689
And have you
tried talking to him

1359
01:25:57,724 --> 01:25:59,793
to find out what the problem is?

1360
01:25:59,827 --> 01:26:01,551
I did not.

1361
01:26:01,586 --> 01:26:03,413
I mean, I'm scared
it will upset him.

1362
01:26:06,137 --> 01:26:08,241
Ma'am, it's hard
for us to tell you

1363
01:26:08,275 --> 01:26:10,551
if your husband is
cheating or not.

1364
01:26:10,586 --> 01:26:12,793
First, you stopped
doing the things

1365
01:26:12,827 --> 01:26:15,137
that sparked up
your relationship,

1366
01:26:15,172 --> 01:26:18,137
the dinner, the
movies, the shopping.

1367
01:26:18,172 --> 01:26:19,517
It's a terror.

1368
01:26:19,551 --> 01:26:23,206
All because you felt too
old for them.

1369
01:26:23,241 --> 01:26:26,689
And he started seeing you
as an old, boring woman

1370
01:26:26,724 --> 01:26:27,724
without spark.

1371
01:26:30,103 --> 01:26:33,586
That aside, he still
compliments you, but you do not.

1372
01:26:37,482 --> 01:26:40,034
I think you're creating
your own side chick.

1373
01:26:40,068 --> 01:26:42,551
Get rid of her before she
takes away your marriage.

1374
01:26:50,275 --> 01:26:51,275
Okay.

1375
01:26:59,862 --> 01:27:01,103
How much do I owe?

1376
01:27:02,827 --> 01:27:04,275
It's a free service,

1377
01:27:06,862 --> 01:27:09,551
but we'll charge you for
your next appointments.

1378
01:27:09,586 --> 01:27:11,241
Okay, thank you.

1379
01:27:11,275 --> 01:27:12,689
