1
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:19,172
Double up now.

2
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:24,070
There you go. That's the way.

3
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:29,509
How's your wind?

4
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,783
Good. I'm up to five miles.

5
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,821
Add wind sprints.

6
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,253
OK.

7
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:41,859
Curious on
who you're gonna fight?

8
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,760
Doesn't matter.

9
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,631
Right. Double up.

10
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,765
Black Cloud.

11
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,035
Black Cloud.

12
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,670
Welcome, folks,
to the fourth annual...

13
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,272
Hey, Tyler, do you want
a snow cone or a cotton candy?

14
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,511
How about some popcorn?

15
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,143
I don't want him eating
all that sugar.

16
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,415
Aw, your mom's no fun, is she?

17
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,149
That's all right, buddy.
I'll take care of you.

18
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,521
Can I get him
a snow cone and cotton candy?

19
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,630
Ride 'em, cowboy.

20
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,667
Better bring in our next cowboy.

21
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,803
From Gallup, New Mexico,
we're talking about Eddie Young.

22
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,505
Come on.

23
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,605
Do we have any Eddie Young fans
out there?

24
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,413
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm telling you...

25
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,579
this cowboy just qualified
for the nationals.

26
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,053
Outside.

27
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,037
Look out, cowboy!

28
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,582
But he's OK. Let's give him
a big round of applause...

29
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,844
for putting on quite a show
out there, folks...

30
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,909
and he's our winner right now--
Round Number One.

31
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,183
-Yeah!
-All right.

32
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,954
At the end of Round One,
it's a tight race, folks.

33
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,755
Here's our cattle.

34
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,091
You want me to come?

35
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,699
I was wondering
if you'd stop by.

36
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,937
I thought you might like
to see your son.

37
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,808
He's older than I thought.

38
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,780
It's been two years, Eddie.

39
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,340
It's been that long, huh?

40
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,011
Well, how you been?

41
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:48,145
We're doing fine.

42
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,417
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

43
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,788
Hey, I qualified for the finals.

44
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,588
Yippee.

45
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,187
There's my girl.

46
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,566
I got a free night.
What do you say?

47
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,931
Go to hell.

48
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:03,663
Damn, I miss your fire.

49
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,064
I don't miss you.

50
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,233
You sure about that?

51
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,901
Maybe just a little bit?

52
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,142
Don't you even
want to know his name?

53
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,643
What's the point?

54
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,919
Tyler, that's your father.

55
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,286
This is the last time
we'll see him.

56
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,827
ls he gonna turn left or right?

57
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,025
-Why you asking me?
-Because you know.

58
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,560
He's gonna fake left
and go right hard.

59
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,968
Navajo Nation.

60
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,200
Outside!

61
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,763
Yeah!

62
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:46,407
Hey!

63
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,608
Hey! Yaah! Come on!

64
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,281
Ha ha! Yeah, yeah, Jimmy!

65
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,180
Jimmy White.

66
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,821
Even losers get lucky sometimes.

67
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,889
Where's Sammie sitting?

68
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,732
They don't need you.

69
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,999
Heh. And she needs you, huh?

70
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,836
She's sweet meat, ain't she?

71
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,238
I'm going to forget
you said that.

72
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:19,404
No. You need to remember
who was there first.

73
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,708
Want to settle this?

74
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,339
Mine's the red Dodge.

75
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,746
Legs in.

76
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,751
Let it ride, Eddie.

77
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,583
-Come on, now.
-Outside!

78
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,623
Black Cloud,
how's the boxing going?

79
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,594
All right.

80
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:39,189
Heard your daddy was
laying in the road last night.

81
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,291
Sounds like him.

82
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,937
Nicely done!

83
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,239
His score is 35.

84
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:54,906
Listen...
Eddie's just passing through.

85
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,246
It's best
you stay away from him.

86
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,309
Sure.

87
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,151
All right.

88
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,247
Good ride, son.

89
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:06,691
Eddie Young, pardners!

90
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,755
Hem you OK?

91
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,766
No, I'm not.

92
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,371
Some things you can't change.

93
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,707
I'll meet you
at the chapter house.

94
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,176
What are you doing?

95
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,873
I'll catch a ride with Jimmy.
Don't worry.

96
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,050
All right.

97
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,552
Well, look who showed up.

98
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,159
If you want that slut,
you can have her.

99
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,389
I'm done with her.

100
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,955
It's time
you were taught a lesson.

101
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,660
And you're the bad-ass Indian
who's going to give me it.

102
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,794
Are we talking or fighting?

103
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,791
Enough. Enough.

104
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,094
Enough.

105
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,535
They're all whores, you know,
including your mama.

106
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,702
You need to learn
when to shut up.

107
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,995
Aah! Aah! Aah!

108
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,360
Aah!

109
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,868
Now, our brothers
who own casinos...

110
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,968
have invited us over
for a visit.

111
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,242
I suggest that we take them up
on their offer...

112
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,249
and see what kind of effects
it has had on their people...

113
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,785
and their land.

114
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,919
I say no to casinos.

115
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:21,552
The Navajo can prosper
only in righteousness.

116
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:22,857
That's right.

117
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,990
You are a wise man,
Joseph Ness...

118
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,127
but my heart and thinking
are different now.

119
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:34,072
Where is it written that being
sick, poor. and uneducated...

120
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,665
are better for our souls?

121
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,507
All right, enough. No more.
Go bother your parents.

122
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,979
Don't blame me
when your teeth fall out.

123
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,709
You're mean.

124
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:44,909
You got one for me?

125
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,282
The schools,
the medicine, the housing...

126
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,048
What happened to you?

127
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:51,454
I bumped into a wall.

128
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,720
You're not funny.

129
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,528
You all right?

130
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,861
I'd be better off
with a brownie.

131
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,424
Have you seen Bud around?

132
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:06,769
Not here. Lucky for you.

133
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,569
Does it hurt?

134
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:13,070
A little bit. You're good.

135
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:15,979
You want to be my corner man?

136
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,143
Ow!

137
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,414
Why do you do this?

138
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,216
You're better than Eddie.

139
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,883
I know that, but he doesn't.

140
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,654
Well, he does now.

141
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,458
One day...

142
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:32,965
you have to grow up.

143
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,828
Only if they make me.

144
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,605
Go home.

145
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:42,334
Get some rest, OK?

146
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,074
Hey, Black Cloud, man! Whoo!

147
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,984
Give me five, man! My son!

148
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,521
Whoo!
Here, have a drink, my man.

149
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,649
Come on.
Come on, join us, man.

150
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:02,787
I wanted to be simple

151
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,695
To be silent...

152
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,565
Why you disrespecting
my friends?

153
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,569
Here, have a drink.
Party with us.

154
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,610
It's time to send
your friends home.

155
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,873
Oh, I see. The party's over.

156
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:23,382
Black Cloud
says the party's over!

157
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,665
Come on! Come on!
Double up, man!

158
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,502
No, we have a good team.
Don't worry about it.

159
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,513
I got a few holes to fill
but we'll fill 'em.

160
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:56,208
I'll fill 'em.

161
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,811
No, just a lot of brawlers.
No skill.

162
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,585
Oh, listen, I got to go.
Rocket's here.

163
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,121
Yeah. Part of the game
I hate, but...

164
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,355
Listen, I got to go.

165
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,921
-Whoo!
-What's up, baby? Knock him out!

166
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:15,366
That's it. Keep your hands up.
That's right.

167
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,699
Hey, Rocket, it's
your favorite Olympic scout.

168
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,898
-How you doing?
-You know I'm doing good, man.

169
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,668
Move around!

170
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,378
Jam him, Cloudy! Come on!

171
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,981
Whoo!

172
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,315
Get your punk ass
back in your corner.

173
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,918
OK, come on.

174
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,592
Your rain man's going down.

175
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,430
Oh, yeah?
How much you want to go?

176
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:51,232
-Two hundred.
-Two hundred.

177
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,669
Breathe.

178
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,239
Breathe.

179
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,242
You can't hurt him
unless you throw him.

180
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,142
Black Cloud,
you can take this guy, man.

181
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:00,702
He's strong.

182
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,077
You're strong.

183
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,310
Hey, man, what's up with you
trying to holler at my man?

184
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,818
You know how many kids he got?

185
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,013
You're talking about money.
I'm talking about the amateurs.

186
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,248
There's no money
in the amateurs.

187
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,915
We're talking about
Olympic gold, Rocket.

188
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,822
Do you know what
it's like when it's mad cold...

189
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,257
you ain't got no heat, hmm?

190
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,421
At Christmas time,
there's nothing under the tree?

191
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,930
You know what that's like,
Norman?

192
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,192
OK, OK, OK.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

193
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,427
What about this, OK?
I'll get you a car.

194
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:22,935
We'll talk to
one of our corporate sponsors.

195
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,061
-We'll get you a deal.
-You can get it for free?

196
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,264
Come on, Rocket.

197
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,773
I can bend the rules.
I can't break them.

198
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,741
You can't break the rules?
Rules are meant to be broken.

199
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,107
This is the amateurs.

200
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,442
And my boxer ain't no amateur.
He's a pro.

201
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,448
You remember that punk cowboy
last weekend?

202
00:13:36,516 --> 00:13:39,315
You got him.
You got this guy, man, OK?

203
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:41,251
You get out first.
Don't wait on him.

204
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,846
Stay on your toes.

205
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,117
I'm going to go inside on him.

206
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,522
Good. Take a deep breath.
Get some gas.

207
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,287
Again.

208
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,352
Right.
Remember, stay on your toes.

209
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,858
Deep breath.

210
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,435
BOX!

211
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,521
Know how much more marketable
you're gonna be if your face...

212
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,786
is on a box of Wheaties
after he wins the Olympic gold?

213
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,055
Them suburban moms don't want me
in their kitchens.

214
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,721
They want me in their beds, kid.

215
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,397
If they saw a boxer-

216
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,635
Who is that kid?

217
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,138
That's Rocket's cousin...

218
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,469
the number one ranked
light heavy.

219
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,406
No. I'm talking about
the Indian kid.

220
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:39,411
Black Cloud
from the Navajo Nation.

221
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,243
The kid's got heart.

222
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,406
He got more than heart.

223
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,075
Overhand fight, Damon.
Come on, baby.

224
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,276
Yeah, let's go, Damon.

225
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,513
That's right. He out of here
like last year, baby.

226
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,198
Come on, Cloudy!

227
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,601
Cloudy!

228
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,173
Stop!

229
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,336
-Whoo!
-One...

230
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,938
-Yeah!
-Two...

231
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,107
Three...

232
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,514
Where the hell
did you come from?

233
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,052
Six...

234
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,020
Medic! Somebody calla medic!

235
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:35,218
How long before I'm on again?

236
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,983
Two hours.

237
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,683
That kid was a good fighter.

238
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,954
He almost had me for a second.

239
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,256
Oh, man.

240
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,160
You can't believe the buzz
about you out there.

241
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,425
Black Cloud this,
Black Cloud that.

242
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,897
"Who the hell is Black Cloud?"

243
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,128
Nobody knows, but I told them
they're going to know...

244
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,760
when you walk away
with this tournament.

245
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,533
All right. but you better cover
what you bet...

246
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:55,040
because I ain't got nothing.

247
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,667
Don't you worry.
I got it covered.

248
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,838
Oh, hey, I just ordered
this George Foreman grill.

249
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,439
Three payments of $19.95.

250
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:05,484
What's the matter with you?

251
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,350
You trying to get us
kicked out of here?

252
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,856
That's low rent, Jimmy.

253
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,948
I'm just trying to pay
the rent, Bud.

254
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:19,697
All right. all right. but when
you don't have gas money...

255
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,564
and need a buck for a Coke,
you don't come crying to me...

256
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:23,727
because I'll tell you
to die of thirst.

257
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,828
Then you can ride that mustang
around the rez.

258
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:28,738
And I ain't canceling
the George Foreman grill.

259
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,539
OK. How about
you get us burgers?

260
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,340
Oh, I see how it is.

261
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,642
You want me to be your slave
and carry your bag...

262
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:38,207
and get your burgers
and not get paid for it?

263
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,351
Want some fries?

264
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,394
Me and him been friends
a long time.

265
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,590
Yeah. They're hard to come by.

266
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,325
Let me look at you.

267
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,996
Yeah.

268
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,506
The swelling"; coming down.

269
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,711
You don't even know
when it happens, do you?

270
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,338
What?

271
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,405
What happens in the ring?

272
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:14,545
I don't know. I just fight.

273
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,282
Crossing over
into the spirit world...

274
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,223
is a powerful thing.

275
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,782
What do you mean?

276
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,693
Where you went...

277
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,861
Our ancestors called for you
and you answered.

278
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:37,967
There was this one voice
that rose above the rest.

279
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,206
You are chosen.

280
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,383
Figure out
why they're calling you.

281
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,185
Great.

282
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,953
I thought only medicine men
had to deal with this.

283
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,686
Excuse me, guys.

284
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,628
I don't want to disturb you.
I'm Norm Olsen.

285
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,689
I saw you fight today,
young man.

286
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,632
Black Cloud.

287
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,670
Nice to meet you, Black Cloud.

288
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,171
How long you been boxing?

289
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,297
I've been fighting
my whole life.

290
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,637
What is it you want, Mr. Olsen?

291
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,507
I don't want anything.
What's your name?

292
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,046
-Bud.
-Good to meet you.

293
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,013
No, I just--I saw something
out there today...

294
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:17,914
that I haven't seen
for quite some time.

295
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:20,077
Oh, yeah? What was that?

296
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,847
I'm sorry.
I didn't get your name.

297
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,548
Jimmy.

298
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,420
Look, I saw raw talent today...

299
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,892
combined
with clarity of purpose.

300
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,930
And I was just wondering-
You know, you got a gift.

301
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,225
What you plan on doing with it?

302
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:33,993
What's it to you?

303
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,899
I'm just a man who doesn't like
to see talent wasted.

304
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,232
Oh, I see.

305
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,739
Unless I play by your rules,
I'm a waste.

306
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,433
You ever think of boxing
in the Olympics?

307
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,237
The question's never been asked.

308
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,938
Well, he should.
He's incredibly talented.

309
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,140
And a man only gets so many
highlights in his life...

310
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,410
and I guarantee you...

311
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,247
you box for your country
in the Olympics...

312
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:53,683
it'll be one of them.

313
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,380
And your interest?

314
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:56,785
I'm an Olympic boxing scout.

315
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,424
Aw, forget it.
I ain't interested.

316
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,590
Cloudy, let's hear
what he has to say, man.

317
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,689
No. I ain't interested in what
the man has to say.

318
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,292
Well, why's that?

319
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:11,598
Because it's lies.
It always is.

320
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,865
I'm sorry.
I'm not following you.

321
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,771
It's in their soul.
They don't know any better.

322
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,809
And why should I fight
for your nation...

323
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:20,107
when all you've done is murder
and imprison my people, huh?

324
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,647
Black Cloud.

325
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,843
I didn't invite you here.
You're not welcome.

326
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,110
Black Cloud, I've done nothing
to your people.

327
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:31,157
Look, there's
an Olympic trial in Vegas.

328
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:32,748
You should be there.

329
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:35,260
I fight for the Navajo Nation.

330
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:40,598
Fine. Nice meeting you, Bud.
See you around, kid.

331
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,084
What are you doing?

332
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,119
He's the stallion
the elders talk about.

333
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,416
How did you catch him?

334
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,082
He caught me.

335
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,387
Come on.
I got someplace to show you.

336
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,553
I can't just leave the kids.

337
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,096
Jackie-'ll Watch them, right?

338
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:52,460
-Sure.
-Come on.

339
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:59,303
Always thought
that I could be John Wayne

340
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:04,743
Come sunset,
I'd sweep you away

341
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,306
But I don't feel much
like him today...

342
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,646
It's magnificent.

343
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:15,813
He's free.

344
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:18,619
How do you find these places?

345
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:21,160
Finding grass for the goats.

346
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:25,026
When there's a drought,
you look everywhere.

347
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:28,863
I like to call this place
the Valley of the Gods.

348
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:32,131
I think this is where
they would visit.

349
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,696
Do you ever get scared out here?

350
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,333
There's nothing to be scared of.

351
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,503
The Winter Wind, maybe
That'll kill you...

352
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,876
if you're standing around,
looking stupid.

353
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,346
That's right. I forgot.

354
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:47,215
You're a big, tough brave
who's not afraid of anything.

355
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,179
There's one thing I'm afraid of.

356
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,748
Really? Let me guess...

357
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,794
losing a fight to a white boy.

358
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:58,296
Heh. Never gonna happen.

359
00:24:58,364 --> 00:24:59,627
The dentist?

360
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,029
Never really needed one.

361
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,659
What?

362
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:05,828
Losing you.

363
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:13,037
That's the sweetest thing
anyone's ever told me.

364
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:15,012
I love you.

365
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,310
I love you more.

366
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,249
I guess I really need

367
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:26,951
Something I can see

368
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,461
Something I can hold

369
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:32,561
Someone to hold me

370
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:35,258
I guess I'm trying to say

371
00:25:35,334 --> 00:25:37,894
That you're the only way

372
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,871
You're the only one

373
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,704
Button your top button.
And fix your tie.

374
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:48,941
My tie ain't gonna make
a difference.

375
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:52,541
Could you please
just try and be nice?

376
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:56,248
I'll go wash behind my ears
in case he looks there.

377
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,056
Hi. Can I help you?

378
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,599
I have a housing appointment
with a Mr. Turpin.

379
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:11,296
Your features are too delicate
to be a Hopi...

380
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,603
and the way you carry yourself-
too refined for a Ute.

381
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:20,976
No. No, neither tribe is
privileged to call you theirs.

382
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,707
You're a Navajo.

383
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:28,886
I'm Turpin.

384
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:31,889
Let's see how I can help you.
Come on in.

385
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,357
OK.

386
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,630
I read in the paper
that a housing project...

387
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,430
with 600 homes might get funded.

388
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:47,769
Do you have any idea
how long that waiting list is?

389
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,777
I, uh, I can't see
you getting a house for...

390
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:55,246
three to five years.

391
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:57,544
However...

392
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:00,813
if you would
like to have lunch...

393
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:03,856
we could explore other options

394
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:07,916
that I'm sure would cut
that time down considerably.

395
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:09,893
You are of legal age, correct?

396
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:12,727
Turned twenty-one last winter.

397
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,926
That's fantastic.

398
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,095
What an exciting time
in a woman's life.

399
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:23,904
You're so full of power
and freedom over your choices.

400
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,137
Would you care for a drink?

401
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,837
No, thank you.

402
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:29,609
Are you sure?
It's cherry schnapps.

403
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,615
Goes down really easy.

404
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,980
Oh, you know, I just remembered.

405
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:40,457
There are several homes
that are currently unoccupied...

406
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,016
because they're being renovated.

407
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:45,928
Do you have an application
I could fill out?

408
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:48,961
Sure you wouldn't like a taste?

409
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,467
Yeah, what do you want?

410
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,199
Are you OK?

411
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:56,207
I'm fine.

412
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:59,210
Mr. Turpin was just telling me
our options for a house.

413
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:02,680
Uh, yeah, I'm Ron Turpin.

414
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:04,273
And you are?

415
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,613
Black Cloud is my boyfriend.

416
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,655
Oh. Well, that's interesting.

417
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:13,954
Look, Why don't the two of you
just Wait outside, and I'll--

418
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,051
I'll deal with this after lunch.

419
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:34,212
Boy, how time flies.

420
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,974
Things took
quite a bit longer...

421
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,540
as I had unexpected company
for lunch.

422
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:41,643
Mr. Turpin, we've had a long day
and we have a long drive home.

423
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,519
We'd like to do what we need
as far as applying for housing.

424
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:49,084
Oh, sure. I'm sorry I took up
so much of your valuable time.

425
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:53,723
But rights to benefits
is a black-and-white issue.

426
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,665
Or, should I say,
a red-and-white issue.

427
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,498
Heh.

428
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,298
Do you know your bloodline?

429
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:01,738
I know my mother and my father
and my grandfather.

430
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:03,138
Yeah, well,
that's not surprising.

431
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,233
Most of you don't know
more than that.

432
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,837
But then, lucky for you,
it's all recorded.

433
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:12,111
Here's your certificate of
Indian blood. Looks good.

434
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:14,016
Now, your C.l.B.
is very interesting.

435
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,056
Your mother, Victoria Ness--
Who's deceased, correct?

436
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,487
was the daughter
of Joseph Ness...

437
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,218
still alive-
and Mary Bahe--deceased,

438
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,818
who were the children of
Joseph Ness and Elsa Johnson...

439
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:24,885
who were the children
of White Wolf and Nanebah.

440
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,522
And that's as far back
as I need to go...

441
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,533
because that's where
your trouble lies.

442
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,501
White Wolf...

443
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:36,235
also know as Hans Schroeder,
born in Hamburg, Germany.

444
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,800
I've walked with blue eyes
in the dream land.

445
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,868
Well, next time
you and Gramps go for a hike...

446
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,244
maybe you can tell him
to keep it in his pants...

447
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,716
or you can punch him
in those blues eyes...

448
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,084
and make 'em black because
boy, you are a mixed-blood"...

449
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,418
and your name
on this application...

450
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,549
pushes Miss Haskie
to the back of the line.

451
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,060
You're a small man.
You hide behind your fear.

452
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,392
-Excuse me?
-Let's go.

453
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:01,999
You took what
you had no right to take.

454
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:03,626
Look, I think
it's time for you to go.

455
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:05,534
-Listen to your woman.
-You stink with fear.

456
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:07,163
Look, I don't have
to listen to this.

457
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,833
Out! Get out!
Before I call the po
i--

458
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,372
They say TO Pity 3/0'-I

459
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:28,319
Turn it off.

460
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,656
Are you gonna be OK?

461
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:37,327
I'm gonna be fine.

462
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,734
It doesn't matter to me,
Black Cloud.

463
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:41,864
It matters to me.

464
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,739
Please don't do this.

465
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,075
If you don't want to be with me,
I'll understand.

466
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:54,079
Listen to me.

467
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:59,516
You gave me hope
when I had none.

468
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:05,495
Tyler and I love you very much.

469
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:07,794
You're everything to us.

470
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,659
So, please...

471
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:13,865
don't bring it up anymore.

472
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,176
Good night.

473
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:52,175
Good morning to you, too.

474
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,409
It's been a long time
since you stayed a night.

475
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:38,683
It's good.

476
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,260
So, how you been?

477
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,823
We're just fine.

478
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,960
No wolves about today?

479
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:54,301
No wolves for a long time.

480
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,602
Last wolf, three toes.

481
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:59,235
You sure there's no white wolf?

482
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:02,507
Somewhere in the darkness?

483
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,853
Where's my keys?

484
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,619
Where's my keys?!

485
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:17,287
In the bedroom, maybe.

486
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,057
Where in the bedroom?!

487
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,438
Hey, Mom.

488
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:37,938
Hey, baby. All right.

489
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,178
Look at that move.
You got the move, baby.

490
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:41,811
Ohh, look at that.

491
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:44,879
Snag. Snagaroo. Ha ha!

492
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,186
I can't find my keys.

493
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,331
Party's over! Everybody out!

494
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,923
I've kicked you out before.

495
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,525
You're done messing
with Indian women-

496
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,262
Hey, bro,
she was touchin' me, too.

497
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:01,203
All right, all right!
I'm goin'.

498
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:03,207
Hey. boy. BOY

499
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:05,937
Boy.

500
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:08,378
Whose house
do you think this is?

501
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,210
It's the white man's house.
It's not yours.

502
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:11,772
Everything we have isn't ours.

503
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,011
What are you saying now?

504
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,813
I'm saying you disgust me.

505
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,880
You shame our family
and you shame our people.

506
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:20,584
What the hell happened to you?

507
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,526
I know about White Wolf,
and why we're cursed.

508
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:24,994
White Wolf who?

509
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,553
Forget it. Where's my keys?

510
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:29,066
You're not getting the keys
till you fix my stereo.

511
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,165
Come on, you ain't so tough.

512
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,434
Come on.
This ain't the boxing ring.

513
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:36,872
Just give me my keys!

514
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:39,803
All right.

515
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:42,711
Don't bite the hand
that feeds you, huh?

516
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:44,271
You're smart.

517
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:47,944
Not like your mother,
who always talked too much.

518
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,852
What the hell you doing
wearing her ring, anyway?

519
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:05,264
-You show me?
-Yeah.

520
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:17,276
Hold it.

521
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:23,649
Can you tell me why there's
two sheriff's cars pulling up?

522
00:35:23,722 --> 00:35:24,951
What?

523
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,190
Get inside.

524
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,053
Ya-te-hay, Sheriff.

525
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:02,252
What brings you out here?

526
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,295
Well. if I said
it was the beautiful scenery...

527
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,831
I'd be 
yin', wouldn't I?

528
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,696
How'd the army treat you?

529
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,201
Saw some things.

530
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,497
Some good, some bad.

531
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,970
You were f
yin'
one of those tank killers.

532
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,473
What do they call those things?

533
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,769
Apache.

534
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,570
Isn't that funny?

535
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,611
A Navajo f
yin' an Apache.

536
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:26,045
Ya-te-hay, Sheriff.
What brings you up here?

537
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,017
Well, that's the second time
I've been asked that...

538
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:30,180
so I guess I'd better answer.

539
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:32,349
I'm looking for the driver
of that truck.

540
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:33,789
Gym room.

541
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,485
Go get him, boys.

542
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,997
Hold it.
No disrespect intended, Sheriff.

543
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:41,726
Why don't we talk out here?

544
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,064
Step aside now
and let my boys do their job.

545
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,832
If they have a job to do,
I won't get in their way.

546
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:48,839
Now, why don't you tell me
what's going on?

547
00:36:48,907 --> 00:36:50,500
You got any firsthand knowledge
about this?

548
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:53,943
'Cause if you don't,
we got nothin' to talk about.

549
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:58,006
Please call Lieutenant Yazzie
and ask him to come out here.

550
00:36:58,083 --> 00:36:59,346
OK, Chief.

551
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,382
Now, Bud,
Why'd you have to go...

552
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:04,513
and complicate things
like that, man?

553
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,421
Look, I've got the victim
in the hospital...

554
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,084
and I've got three witnesses
to the attempted murder.

555
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,786
Attempted murder?

556
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:10,987
Right.

557
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,530
Who's in the hospital?

558
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,895
Bud, We're not in the habit of
divulging victims' information.

559
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,901
Lieutenant Yazzie's
already headed this way, honey.

560
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:26,403
What happened, Black Cloud?

561
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:27,946
I taught Eddie Young a lesson.

562
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,912
That's bullshit, son.
You tried to kill him.

563
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,075
He'd be dead
if I wanted him dead.

564
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,777
ls that a fact?

565
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,418
Why don't you get in the car...

566
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:44,155
so we can go downtown
and clear this up?

567
00:37:44,229 --> 00:37:48,359
Stand still until
we talk to Lieutenant Yazzie.

568
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,868
You got no power on the rez.

569
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,097
You and I both know you can't
stay on the rez forever.

570
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:56,471
Say, isn't your sister
married to a Young?

571
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:59,533
Yeah. That's my nephew
lying in the hospital.

572
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,045
Not smart.

573
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,941
What are you doing?

574
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:07,383
You know you're supposed
to give me a heads-up...

575
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,681
when you're on the rez.

576
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,152
See? You have no power here.

577
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:11,848
Son, don't be ta
kin' shit
you can't back up.

578
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:13,049
Now, get in the car.

579
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,285
Shut up.

580
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:17,124
We have an attempted murder,
we have a positive ID...

581
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,560
and we want Black Cloud
for questioning.

582
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,099
Black Cloud, get a lawyer...

583
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:22,827
and we'll go in
for questioning tomorrow.

584
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,835
No deal.
We think he's a risk for flight.

585
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,667
We want him now,
we want him confined...

586
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,103
and we don't want him
running around the rez.

587
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:29,299
Question him now.

588
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:30,967
Without a lawyer?

589
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,066
What do you want to know?

590
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,237
Where's the bat
you assaulted Eddie with?

591
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,406
No bat. Just these.

592
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:41,249
Cliff, this sounds like
a fight went wrong.

593
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,684
This wasn't just a fight, Bud.

594
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,119
My nephew's
laying in the hospital...

595
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:46,385
with a pierced lung
and he's fightin' for his life.

596
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:48,118
You crossed a line, son.

597
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:50,218
Attempted murder follows you
anywhere you go.

598
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:51,421
Now, get in the car!

599
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,157
I ain't goin' nowhere!

600
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,504
This incident...

601
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:02,631
happened on the rez.

602
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,038
Don't pull that shit, Bud...

603
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,542
cause it'll come back
to bite you.

604
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,341
You people don't live in some
self-sufficient world out here.

605
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,006
Sooner or later,
you gotta go into town...

606
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,106
cash your check,
and pick up a six-pack.

607
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,446
I think I've heard enough.

608
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,316
I'll look into it.

609
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,683
There were witnesses.

610
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:18,222
I'll let you know what I find.

611
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,490
All right.

612
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,494
You played this one wrong.

613
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:28,328
If that's the way you want it,
that's the way you'll get it.

614
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,629
I'll be seeing you.

615
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,905
Black Cloud...

616
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:39,376
if Eddie dies, there ain't
a man in this world...

617
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:41,310
that can protect you, son.

618
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,040
That's a promise.

619
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,191
Stay out of trouble.

620
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,825
What's wrong with you?

621
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,698
You've got everything.

622
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,532
Why do you want
to throw it away?

623
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,002
Eddie had a chance.

624
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,401
This stops now.

625
00:40:10,475 --> 00:40:12,307
Now, here's the deal...

626
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:14,778
you live under my roof...

627
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:17,008
or we can't work together.

628
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,049
That ain't gonna work.

629
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:22,348
I come and go as I want.

630
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,650
I'll be seeing you.

631
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:38,536
Black Cloud. What's going on?

632
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:41,004
Not much. ls Sammie around?

633
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,733
Yeah, she's inside.

634
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:46,243
But let's talk about something
out there for a second.

635
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,985
So, what's up?

636
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:57,454
A complaint came into
the tribal office...

637
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:59,047
from Mr. Turpin
at Indian Affairs...

638
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,454
while you were gone.

639
00:41:00,525 --> 00:41:02,516
Yeah. Me and Sammie
went up to Gallup...

640
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:04,391
to apply for rez housing.

641
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,987
Mr. Turpin says
you assaulted him.

642
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:07,463
He pushed Sammie.

643
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:12,766
Did Eddie--who's lying in
the hospital--push Sammie, too?

644
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,807
I'm seeing a side of you
that I don't like.

645
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:21,672
This doesn't only
just affect you.

646
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:25,683
You need to think
about Sammie and Tyler's future.

647
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,549
I'm sorry, Black Cloud.
I really am.

648
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:31,486
Don't feel sorry for me.
I'll be all right.

649
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:33,786
Tell Sammie I'll be seeing her.

650
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,691
I want you to stay away
from Sammie.

651
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,090
Don't make this harder
than it already is.

652
00:41:56,981 --> 00:42:00,007
Hey, Black Cloud.
Somebody give him a beer.

653
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,451
Give him a beer, man!

654
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,318
What are you guys up to tonight?

655
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:07,825
The question is,
can you keep it up tonight?

656
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,724
Damn, bitch. Are you in heat?

657
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,607
I'll go look for him
in the kitchen.

658
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,378
I'll look over there.

659
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:36,580
Sol hit him over and over.
When I finally quit...

660
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,622
the whole side of his face
was, like, mush.

661
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,021
Ha ha! That's awesome, man.
Awesome.

662
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:43,083
The best part
about beatin' the white...

663
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:44,925
is the shock in their eyes.

664
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,589
Deb, what are you doing here?

665
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,463
Hey, Jimmy,
you want to be my stud?

666
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:51,559
This guy's so lame.

667
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,031
Look,
when your brother finds out...

668
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:56,437
you're gonna be in trouble.

669
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:58,236
They don't care what I do.

670
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,799
Go home.

671
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,538
Who invited Black Cloud?

672
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:02,738
I did.

673
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:04,509
And he's staying the night, too.

674
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,516
Can't let him
drink and drive, you know?

675
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:13,256
Black Cloud.

676
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,450
What are you doing here?

677
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:17,925
What does it look like
I'm doing?

678
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:19,463
Having a good time.

679
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,656
Yeah.

680
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,790
Why didn't you call?

681
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:24,858
Since when do I need
your permission?

682
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,199
Move.

683
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:29,598
What the hell is going on?

684
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:31,267
What do you mean?

685
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:35,142
Since when do you hang out
with these losers?

686
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:37,773
This is my tribe.
They're not losers.

687
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:39,339
We're the Mixed-blood Clan!

688
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:40,612
Mixed-blood!

689
00:43:40,685 --> 00:43:41,982
This is my new family.

690
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,818
Black Cloud, you're nothing
at all like them.

691
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:47,790
You're special.

692
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:49,588
Why are you doing this?

693
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,994
Because it's in my blood,
Sammie.

694
00:43:53,064 --> 00:43:54,293
My blood is poison.

695
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:56,356
There's nothing
I can do about it!

696
00:43:56,434 --> 00:44:00,496
I don't care who your
great-great-grandfather was.

697
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,901
You don't want to be
with a mixed-blood...

698
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:06,273
or have mixed-blood kids.

699
00:44:06,344 --> 00:44:09,507
Look what happened last time.

700
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,981
Last time...

701
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:13,574
I got Tyler.

702
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:18,012
Do you see it bothering me?

703
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:19,523
Don't you get it?

704
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,615
This isn't gonna work.

705
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:25,060
We're not gonna work,
so get the hell out of here!

706
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,458
Here's your beer, Black Cloud.

707
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:32,163
Hi, Sammie. It's been a while.

708
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,305
I'm not looking back.

709
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:43,809
Bud, open up! Bud!

710
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:49,781
What gives you the right, huh?

711
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,049
To sit up all high?

712
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:53,113
You're just as bad as they are!

713
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,625
I thought
you weren't coming back.

714
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,662
Well, I'm back. So what?

715
00:44:57,728 --> 00:44:59,196
Where you been?

716
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,992
Partying-

717
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:03,159
What's to celebrate?

718
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:05,635
Custer, that white prick.

719
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:08,172
Heh. I'm ce
ebratin' him.

720
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,309
They took it all, Bud!

721
00:45:13,344 --> 00:45:15,005
Fuck.

722
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:18,310
You're right. They did.

723
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,214
You're gonna let that
ruin your life?

724
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,480
I'm taking it back.

725
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,488
I'm taking it all back!

726
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,815
Well, put down your beer
and come on in.

727
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:45,767
Bud, I can't remember
what my mom looked like.

728
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:50,914
She was pretty, right?

729
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,710
She sure was.

730
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,118
Yeah, I thought she was pretty.

731
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:08,865
Your mom and my wife were
the two everyone was after.

732
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,061
And I was lucky I got one.

733
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:15,069
I'm a mixed-blood.

734
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:20,105
Yeah. I know.

735
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,043
Sammie.

736
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,021
I thought you were dying.

737
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,957
Well, I am, without you, baby.

738
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:38,422
Please go away.

739
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:41,261
Hold on, Sammie.

740
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:43,801
Now, I know
I haven't treated you right...

741
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:45,597
but I'm here
to make it up to you.

742
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:48,799
Eddie, too many things
have changed.

743
00:46:48,873 --> 00:46:50,841
Can't a guy get a second chance?

744
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:54,538
I mean, to make it right
with his--his family?

745
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:57,681
Hey.

746
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,682
Taylor, buddy. I'm your daddy.

747
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,184
What do you want, Eddie?

748
00:47:18,903 --> 00:47:20,337
You don't know how many times...

749
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:22,498
I picked up that phone
to call you, but...

750
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,337
I just didn't know what to say.

751
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:25,603
But I swear to you, baby...

752
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,041
I thought about you
all the time.

753
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:35,779
I loved you once.

754
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:39,288
But I don't even
recognize you anymore.

755
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,291
Well, let's go out
and do a little dancin'...

756
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:45,523
a little drinkin'.
You'll remember me then.

757
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:50,500
Sammie, you're the only one
that's ever done it for me.

758
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:53,538
The last time we went drinking,
we made Tyler.

759
00:47:54,839 --> 00:47:57,308
He's the last good thing
you'll ever do.

760
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:08,243
Look around you, Sammie.

761
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,413
This is your future.

762
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:12,718
It's pretty, ain't it?

763
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:56,023
I told you I'd get you.

764
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,569
I guess you were right.

765
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,695
I can't stay on the rez forever.

766
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,739
Had to get my beer.

767
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:08,374
Well, you'll find
I'm right about a lot of things.

768
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,780
So, are you gonna pull me out
and beat the piss out of me?

769
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:13,248
I might.

770
00:49:14,585 --> 00:49:17,384
What are you waitin' for?

771
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,514
You know, Eddie's ignorant...

772
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,490
but he didn't deserve
what you did to him.

773
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:24,324
Eddie got the girl.
He's all right.

774
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:26,887
Beat me 'cause you Want to.

775
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,090
What are you doing?

776
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:29,291
Resisting arrest.

777
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:30,458
Get back in the truck.

778
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:32,298
Make me.

779
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:35,966
What happened to you?

780
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,408
I'm who I always was,
just another drunk injun.

781
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,241
So come on! Open my head!

782
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:44,247
You are drunk. Do you know
who you're ta
kin' to?

783
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,409
Sure, you're the cowboy.
I'm the injun.

784
00:49:47,952 --> 00:49:50,922
Come on, John Wayne!
Time to take me out!

785
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,148
This isn't a movie, son.

786
00:49:54,225 --> 00:49:57,786
If I take you down,
it's gonna hurt.

787
00:49:57,862 --> 00:49:59,626
So hurt me already.

788
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:03,089
Come on!

789
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,295
So, you like John Wayne movies?

790
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,199
So do I.

791
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,609
I remember watching
John Wayne and his boys...

792
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,304
take out them injuns
by the hundreds...

793
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:18,314
makin' it safe
for all the wagon trains.

794
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:21,079
Things were a lot simpler then,
weren't they?

795
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:22,312
Yeah.

796
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:26,089
Till one day, I'm sittin'
in front of the TV...

797
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:29,285
shootin' down injuns
with the Duke.

798
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:34,127
Then I stopped 'cause
I realized I was one of them.

799
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:37,896
That's the day you started
hatin' the white man.

800
00:50:39,003 --> 00:50:41,370
That's the day I became ashamed.

801
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:44,237
Son, we're all dealt
different hands in life.

802
00:50:44,308 --> 00:50:46,970
The sooner you learn to play
yours and stop b
uffin'...

803
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,012
the quicker
you'll find your place.

804
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:50,547
Are you gonna beat me or not?

805
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,881
Come on, pussy!
Where you goin'?

806
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,488
I'm here! Come on!

807
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:00,615
Where you goin'?

808
00:51:01,926 --> 00:51:03,985
Go home, Black Cloud.

809
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:14,101
Don't know what it is,
but the little girls love it

810
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:16,037
I like it, I love it

811
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,666
I want some more of it

812
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,836
Hey, Black Cloud!

813
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:21,969
Yo, you going to sit
on the couch all night?

814
00:51:22,046 --> 00:51:23,571
Come on, man,
get up and help us out.

815
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:24,842
Sing us a tune, man.

816
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,680
No, I'm fine right here.
You have fun.

817
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,048
Yeah. Argh!

818
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,609
Aah!

819
00:51:30,688 --> 00:51:32,247
Yee heel

820
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:37,924
You know,
I want you to know...

821
00:51:37,995 --> 00:51:40,362
that I forgive you
for breaking my stereo.

822
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,024
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

823
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,090
In fact,
I want to thank you...

824
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:46,694
cause if you hadn't, I Wouldn't
have gotten that beauty.

825
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,796
I'm ho
din' umbrellas
and openin' up doors

826
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:54,777
I'm takin' out the trash
and I'm sweepin' the floors

827
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:58,281
Dad, do you remember
what Mom looks like?

828
00:51:59,717 --> 00:52:02,618
I'm like this
cause I like it

829
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:05,485
I love it,
I want some more of it

830
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:06,717
I try

831
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:11,961
Come on.
You're dropping your hands.

832
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:18,728
I can land those all day.

833
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,395
So, you're a mixed blood, huh?

834
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:22,872
Big deal.

835
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,669
We're all mixed up some way.

836
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:27,439
Shut up.

837
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,946
You and Sammie split up, huh?

838
00:52:30,014 --> 00:52:31,573
Where'd you hear that?

839
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,242
It's written all over your face.

840
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:36,514
She's better off without me.

841
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:38,521
First smart thing
I heard you say.

842
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:39,954
Why's that?

843
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:42,789
First sign of trouble
and you run.

844
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,420
It's best now she knows
what kind of man you are.

845
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:46,964
I said shut your mouth!

846
00:52:47,031 --> 00:52:48,658
Shut it for me.

847
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:55,269
See? You can't even put
one foot in front of the other.

848
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,602
You can't think.

849
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,870
You're so full of fear!

850
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,467
What are you afraid of?

851
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:01,875
Shut your mouth!

852
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:03,879
I already told you
to shut my mouth...

853
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:05,381
and you can't even do that.

854
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:29,966
Your daddy's a drunk,
and your mama died...

855
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,906
and you're a mixed blood.

856
00:53:34,078 --> 00:53:35,671
Poor, poor Black Cloud.

857
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:38,215
What do you know about shit?

858
00:53:38,282 --> 00:53:42,685
A lot of people who have it
harder than you don't quit.

859
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:44,482
You betrayed your nation.

860
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:45,989
You fought for the whites!

861
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:49,356
If you want to hide behind
your ignorance, go ahead.

862
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,155
You're the ignorant one.

863
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:53,390
Come and shut
this ignorant mouth.

864
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:03,103
Come on, kid. Shut my mouth.

865
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:04,937
That's it. That's it.

866
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:09,241
That's it.

867
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:21,449
Look...

868
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:23,516
we'll beat this.

869
00:55:29,293 --> 00:55:31,318
I've been expecting you.

870
00:55:31,395 --> 00:55:35,662
You leave tracks easy enough
for a blind man to follow.

871
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:37,757
Things have changed.

872
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,599
I can see it in your eyes.

873
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,798
I'm a mixed-blood now.

874
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:44,170
The truth was always the truth.

875
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:46,835
Now it is known, and it is good.

876
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,537
It's good I lost my girl?

877
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:50,808
That I'm at war
with the white man?

878
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:55,011
You have to lose yourself
before you find yourself.

879
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:59,022
I can't find crap.
It's all decided for me.

880
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,783
Are you done whining?

881
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:05,522
Let's walk.

882
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:07,956
Where are we going?

883
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,692
To the past.

884
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:17,199
So, you want to hear
about White Wolf?

885
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:34,011
In the last days...

886
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:36,280
a girl named Nanebah...

887
00:57:36,353 --> 00:57:39,118
took a pony
to a special place...

888
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:43,387
where she would pick flowers
for her wedding dress.

889
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:51,957
Three white men came upon her.

890
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:08,015
Nanebah was found wandering
with her head full of demons...

891
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:10,179
by a white hunter.

892
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:24,232
He became White Wolf,
your great-great grandfather.

893
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:28,363
He brought great honor
to our people.

894
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:31,430
We accepted him as our own.

895
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:37,146
Did you meet White Wolf?

896
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:44,852
Rest.

897
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:48,584
I will be waiting
on the other side.

898
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:05,835
What the hell was in that tea?

899
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,278
Where do you want to go
with the herd today?

900
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:16,043
I was thinking
that little box canyon...

901
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,144
with the spring?

902
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,081
Grandpa?

903
00:59:24,828 --> 00:59:26,626
Grandpa.

904
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:19,168
Thanks for coming.

905
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:00,483
What?

906
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,014
Where are we going?

907
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:06,946
Thanks, friend.

908
01:03:07,017 --> 01:03:08,746
Black Cloud, what are you doing?

909
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:10,445
I need to talk with Sammie.

910
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,988
Daddy.

911
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:24,227
I'm sorry. I've done nothing
to dishonor us.

912
01:03:27,337 --> 01:03:29,271
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

913
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:30,738
My blood is good.

914
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:34,971
ls this how it's gonna be?

915
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:36,911
'Cause my heart can't take it.

916
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:42,411
I'm sorry.
I'll never leave again.

917
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:49,948
You better not.

918
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:52,592
I will love you forever.

919
01:04:04,074 --> 01:04:05,200
I love you.

920
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:07,266
I love you more.

921
01:04:11,748 --> 01:04:14,080
I know I don't have much...

922
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:16,346
but whatever I have
I will give to you.

923
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:22,685
What are you doing?

924
01:04:24,828 --> 01:04:28,162
I know you could do better,
but I promise you...

925
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:31,565
you'll never regret
giving me a chance.

926
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:34,663
You sure?

927
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,366
Will you marry me?

928
01:04:43,947 --> 01:04:45,244
Yes!

929
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,745
Hello.

930
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:24,480
Hey, Bud, it's Norm Olsen.
You still coming?

931
01:05:24,554 --> 01:05:28,184
Yeah. We'll be
pulling in around 3:00.

932
01:05:28,258 --> 01:05:30,750
Great. Just make sure
he's in shape...

933
01:05:30,827 --> 01:05:33,194
'cause he's gonna be facing
one tough kid.

934
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:37,131
I hope he shows up, 'cause
my guy's ready to be seen.

935
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,328
Hey, he's never
done this before, right?

936
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:41,996
-Uh-uh.
-You sure he's up to it?

937
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:43,664
This one's different.

938
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:45,970
He doesn't fight for attention.

939
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:48,670
He fights because he needs to.

940
01:05:50,814 --> 01:05:54,375
The sun on my shoulders

941
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:59,355
And the wind at my back

942
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:04,724
Bound and determined
to get back on track

943
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:10,964
To where the heart is

944
01:06:11,034 --> 01:06:15,232
Where it's been all along

945
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:20,766
Sometimes you don't know
what you got till it's gone

946
01:06:20,844 --> 01:06:23,506
Gone, gone, gone

947
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:27,847
And I've been out there
searching

948
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:31,820
For a place where I belong

949
01:06:31,888 --> 01:06:37,793
And on my way I heard my song

950
01:06:37,861 --> 01:06:44,699
Let it sing me home

951
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:47,862
Be sure to bring my fiancé
home in one piece, OK?

952
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,632
That's up to him.

953
01:06:49,706 --> 01:06:52,198
I remember the night
before Bud fought...

954
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:54,403
for the army championship
in Germany.

955
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:57,174
I was pregnant with Christopher
at the time...

956
01:06:57,247 --> 01:06:59,716
and I was so afraid for him.

957
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:01,511
I didn't know you had a son.

958
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:06,553
Our son was killed...

959
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:09,923
a long time ago
by a drunken driver.

960
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:13,660
I'm sorry.

961
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:17,398
Hey, what's up, everyone?

962
01:07:17,467 --> 01:07:20,368
This is Missy Bitsui,
and she's raised traditionally

963
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:22,165
so she's not down
with the English.

964
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:25,697
Isn't she great, man?
I think I'm in love.

965
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:26,901
ls this what you guys feel like?

966
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:29,411
Where you guys off to?

967
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:30,878
Gonna shoot some pool.

968
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:38,551
She's the one. I can feel it.

969
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,885
She's gonna pop me out
a lot of good kids.

970
01:07:40,957 --> 01:07:42,322
Jimmy, she doesn't even
speak English.

971
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:43,757
How do you know?

972
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:46,056
Body language, Cloudy.

973
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:48,723
That's the only language
that doesn't lie.

974
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:52,400
Having some fun, baby?

975
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,631
Say exactly how you feel

976
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:03,179
Right now
you're free to sail off

977
01:08:05,348 --> 01:08:09,410
There is no one here
to judge you

978
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:11,749
I only love you

979
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:15,849
You're free to close
your eyes and fall

980
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:19,393
You can trust me

981
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:22,557
This is real

982
01:08:22,632 --> 01:08:27,126
Say exactly how you feel

983
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:30,366
Tell me...

984
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,602
I know we're not married yet...

985
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:35,303
but I was wondering
how you felt about having kids.

986
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,381
What do you think?

987
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,942
I asked you first.

988
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:49,557
I don't think
we should rush or anything.

989
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:52,527
The only question in my mind
is how many.

990
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:58,133
I love you so much.

991
01:08:58,201 --> 01:09:00,033
I love you more.

992
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:05,065
Be ever

993
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:08,167
Mine

994
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:18,077
Hey. you guys want a Coke?

995
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,589
Don't forget to breathe.

996
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,059
I'll be right back.

997
01:09:25,128 --> 01:09:26,618
I'll meet you at the table.

998
01:09:33,403 --> 01:09:34,700
Well, I gotta give it to you.

999
01:09:34,771 --> 01:09:37,103
You kicked the crap outta me.

1000
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,873
You're out of the hospital.
That's good.

1001
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:42,604
It's not good for you.

1002
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,705
Eddie, look, I'm sorry
for what I did to you.

1003
01:09:45,782 --> 01:09:48,649
But I didn't know the things
I know now.

1004
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:51,915
When we're done with you,
you won't know nothin'.

1005
01:09:53,456 --> 01:09:56,482
Well, what do you know, boys?
Caught us an Indian.

1006
01:09:56,559 --> 01:09:59,460
-ls that him?
-Yeah. That's the one.

1007
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:02,865
Hey there, red man.

1008
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:06,800
We don't have
no plastic L.A. friends

1009
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:09,736
Ain't on the edge
of no popular trend

1010
01:10:09,806 --> 01:10:12,832
Ain't never seen
the inside of that magazine...

1011
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:26,384
My neck's always been red

1012
01:10:26,456 --> 01:10:30,051
My collar"; still blue

1013
01:10:30,126 --> 01:10:31,924
We've always been...

1014
01:10:31,994 --> 01:10:34,793
Jimmy.
Jimmy, Black Cloud"; gone.

1015
01:10:34,864 --> 01:10:36,332
I think something's going down.

1016
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:44,700
You've always been

1017
01:10:44,774 --> 01:10:47,607
Red, white, and blue

1018
01:10:47,677 --> 01:10:49,577
-Yeah!
-Let's get him!

1019
01:10:52,782 --> 01:10:54,750
Feels good, doesn't it?

1020
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:56,876
Come on, red man!

1021
01:10:56,953 --> 01:10:59,581
How's that feel, huh?

1022
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:08,522
Unh! Aah!

1023
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:12,000
Who'll save you now, huh?
Who's tough now?

1024
01:11:12,068 --> 01:11:14,400
Go! Get out!
Come on, get out!

1025
01:11:18,141 --> 01:11:19,609
Jimmy?

1026
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:22,440
Jimmy! Jimmy! Lay still, man!

1027
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:25,243
Lay still!
Somebody call for help!

1028
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,009
Lay still.
It's gonna be all right, Jimmy.

1029
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:30,747
It's gonna--Somebody call
for help! Oh, my God.

1030
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:33,084
Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy.

1031
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:37,691
That boy bled a lot.

1032
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,060
Kid's touch and go.
Doesn't look good.

1033
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,792
Shit. Hell of a night.

1034
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,672
So, you want to tell me
your side?

1035
01:11:53,743 --> 01:11:56,508
Eddie shoved a bottle
in Jimmy's throat.

1036
01:11:56,579 --> 01:11:59,514
Same Jimmy that's been beatin'
on people with pool cues?

1037
01:11:59,582 --> 01:12:01,346
They were gonna kill
Black Cloud if he didn't.

1038
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:05,020
Boys were just giving him
a little payback.

1039
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:07,021
Got a little carried away.

1040
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:08,818
But the way I see it...

1041
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:11,383
it's just--just
an unfortunate accident.

1042
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,894
Fight gone wrong.

1043
01:12:12,962 --> 01:12:14,452
Isn't that what
Bud called the last one?

1044
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:17,261
Those cowboys
are going home tonight.

1045
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,825
It's funny the way
justice works, isn't it?

1046
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:21,461
It don't care who pays...

1047
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:23,164
as long as the scales
are evened up.

1048
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:28,040
They're not even,
and they never will be.

1049
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,839
You're right.

1050
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:31,880
Guess it means we'll be seeing
each other again.

1051
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,790
Black Cloud...

1052
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:44,190
hear you're headed to Vegas.

1053
01:12:52,635 --> 01:12:54,399
There comes a time
in a man's life

1054
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:55,596
A challenge will come

1055
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:57,105
You either stand or get whacked

1056
01:12:57,173 --> 01:12:58,572
Got your back against the rope

1057
01:12:58,641 --> 01:12:59,972
But there's still hope

1058
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,703
If you gotta go, leave swinging

1059
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:03,506
Makin' sure the whole world know

1060
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:05,707
There comes a time
in a man's life

1061
01:13:05,781 --> 01:13:06,771
A challenge will come

1062
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:08,408
You either stand or get whacked

1063
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:09,576
Got your back against the rope

1064
01:13:09,652 --> 01:13:11,142
But there's still hope

1065
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,585
If you gotta go, leave swingin'

1066
01:13:12,655 --> 01:13:14,089
Makin' sure
the whole world knows

1067
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:16,716
Now, I got
Nike, Puma, and Adidas...

1068
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:18,282
ready to holler at my man...

1069
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:19,988
and y'all want him
to stay amateur?

1070
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,530
This guy's crazy.

1071
01:13:21,597 --> 01:13:24,225
We're talking about one year
out of your whole career.

1072
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:25,699
The money'l
 be there, bigger,
after the Olympics.

1073
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:27,668
Man, don't listen to this idiot.

1074
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,796
His kids can't eat
no Olympic medals.

1075
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:32,466
Now, what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna win the tournament,

1076
01:13:32,541 --> 01:13:36,444
you're gonna knock him out,
we go pro, and that's that.

1077
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:38,913
It's up to you, bro.
I mean, it's your call.

1078
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:47,854
Show me the money, man.

1079
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:49,358
Shit.

1080
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:52,224
'Cause I spent too long
a poor nigga, you understand?

1081
01:13:52,295 --> 01:13:55,196
No. Know what I understand?
I understand you just made...

1082
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:56,561
the biggest mistake
of your whole life.

1083
01:13:56,632 --> 01:13:58,066
Man, what do you know?

1084
01:13:58,134 --> 01:13:59,568
You don't know shit about me
or where I'm from.

1085
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:01,865
-Hey, Norm.
-Nice to see you guys.

1086
01:14:01,938 --> 01:14:04,600
Hold up. Fall back, man.
We havin' a meeting, all right?

1087
01:14:04,674 --> 01:14:05,971
No. Our meeting's over.

1088
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:07,510
-Over?
-We been dismissed?

1089
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:09,237
Not unless you want to meet who
you'll be fighting in the final.

1090
01:14:09,312 --> 01:14:10,404
-Who, Tonto?
-Yeah.

1091
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:12,311
Hey, knock it off, man.
Calm down.

1092
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:13,576
Show respect.

1093
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:15,048
Chill out, chief.
We ain't even ta
kin' to you.

1094
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,812
Shut up.

1095
01:14:16,886 --> 01:14:19,014
Oh, come on, red man.
Shut my black mouth up.

1096
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:22,547
OK, OK. I'm white,
you're black, he's red.

1097
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,957
Now that we have that resolved
for our color-blind friends...

1098
01:14:25,027 --> 01:14:27,724
Rocket,
go on with your day, man.

1099
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,128
Go on with your day.

1100
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:31,064
You better hope we don't meet!

1101
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:33,124
Yo, Dusty,
you better talk to him.

1102
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:34,670
Come on, dawg.

1103
01:14:34,737 --> 01:14:36,227
Sorry about that, man.

1104
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:38,831
It's not your fault, Dusty.
You tried, I know.

1105
01:14:38,908 --> 01:14:40,672
Yeah.

1106
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:43,007
How's the hothead?

1107
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:45,275
Hothead's hotter than ever,
as you can see.

1108
01:14:45,348 --> 01:14:47,146
Yeah. Thanks
for getting me registered.

1109
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:49,981
What changed your mind?

1110
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:52,817
I'm seeing things clearer.

1111
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:54,185
Made some peace.

1112
01:14:54,256 --> 01:14:58,750
You didn't turn into
a flower child, have you?

1113
01:14:58,828 --> 01:15:00,296
OK, this is the way
it's gonna go.

1114
01:15:00,363 --> 01:15:02,559
You're gonna be fighting
the best in the country.

1115
01:15:02,631 --> 01:15:05,362
If you win,
you go to the Olympic trials.

1116
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:07,368
Any questions?

1117
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:10,371
When do I start?

1118
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:12,669
Ahh

1119
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:14,767
Now, everybody ready?

1120
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,505
All right, here we go

1121
01:15:16,579 --> 01:15:19,549
To the tribes, reservations,
all my nations, check, check

1122
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:23,017
Where my natives
with the bomb at?

1123
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:26,111
Who them natives left
these long tracks?

1124
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:28,316
You love hangin'
with this warrior?

1125
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:29,654
Hell, yeah

1126
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:31,250
Do these goddesses ignore you?

1127
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:32,419
Hell, nah

1128
01:15:32,495 --> 01:15:34,190
From the east to the west,
who the best?

1129
01:15:34,263 --> 01:15:35,628
Who on the rez
got honeys with chest

1130
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:36,824
Who got 'Vettes,
spark the gets

1131
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:38,731
Catch sack rats
in matching sets

1132
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:40,235
Do you lean back
when you ride?

1133
01:15:40,302 --> 01:15:42,236
Flip the switch
from side to side

1134
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:43,567
Three wheel
make big dawg smile

1135
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:45,664
Do it again,
but let me slip on in

1136
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:49,541
Did you see that?

1137
01:15:49,612 --> 01:15:52,013
I didn't see a thing.
He's way too quick.

1138
01:15:52,081 --> 01:15:54,311
He's gonna sleep awhile.

1139
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:03,452
Neutral corner. Neutral corner.

1140
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:10,594
By unanimous decision...

1141
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:12,828
Black Cloud!

1142
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:14,165
Black Cloud,
where do you come from?

1143
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:16,398
I'm from the Navajo Nation.

1144
01:16:16,472 --> 01:16:18,440
And what's the Navajo Nation?

1145
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:19,770
It's our homeland.

1146
01:16:19,842 --> 01:16:23,039
Bud, where'd he get his name?

1147
01:16:23,112 --> 01:16:24,546
In the summertime...

1148
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:29,210
when those thunderstorms
roll in with black clouds...

1149
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:30,980
you'd better duck.

1150
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:32,316
Ooh.

1151
01:16:32,388 --> 01:16:35,289
You like to throw a double
hook-uppercut combination.

1152
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:37,553
Where'd you learn that,
Jack Dempsey?

1153
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:44,189
No. I, uh, I fought
a big cowboy on the rez.

1154
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:45,734
It's the only thing
that worked on him.

1155
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:48,699
Ain't you funny?

1156
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:52,706
But I ain't no cowboy.
I'm a nigga from the hood.

1157
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,937
You ain't never seen
someone like me!

1158
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,535
I guess we'll see about that
tomorrow, huh?

1159
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:58,808
Tomorrow you're gonna be
runnin' till I catch you...

1160
01:16:58,881 --> 01:17:00,713
and you be cryin' for your mama
while I'm hurtin' you!

1161
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:02,444
Hey, Rocket,
when you gonna take him out?

1162
01:17:02,518 --> 01:17:05,249
When am I gonna take him out?

1163
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,719
After you beg me for more...

1164
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:10,657
then I'll take him out.

1165
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:12,820
Black Cloud, what do you have
to say about that?

1166
01:17:12,895 --> 01:17:15,921
A big mouth is
a sign of fear and ignorance.

1167
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:17,625
I'll take you on
right now, Tonto!

1168
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:21,227
You, the Lone Ranger, Silver,
your whole goddamn posse!

1169
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,793
-Let's go.
-You ain't shit!

1170
01:17:22,872 --> 01:17:23,930
Tomorrow.

1171
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:25,735
You ain't even
in my same league, dude!

1172
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:28,539
I got some-thin' real
for your ass in these hands!

1173
01:17:30,412 --> 01:17:34,371
Cut off the ring
and bang on his arms.

1174
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:37,943
Are you ready?

1175
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:40,352
I'm good.

1176
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:41,617
How's your hands?

1177
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,658
They're sore.

1178
01:17:43,726 --> 01:17:45,751
Just one more to go.

1179
01:17:58,541 --> 01:18:00,566
This is the one I wore.

1180
01:18:00,643 --> 01:18:03,510
It's yours if you want it.

1181
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:34,173
Land of the free

1182
01:18:34,243 --> 01:18:37,076
And the home

1183
01:18:37,146 --> 01:18:41,583
Of the brave

1184
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:43,584
Come on, baby!

1185
01:18:43,652 --> 01:18:44,983
Yeah! Let's go!

1186
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:47,421
-Come on, Rocket!
-Let's go, dawg!

1187
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:49,651
OK, guys, this is
for the championship.

1188
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,318
Congratulations
on making it here.

1189
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:52,724
I want a clean battle.

1190
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:55,287
Keep your hands up,
protect yourself at all times...

1191
01:18:55,364 --> 01:18:57,492
and listen to my commands.
All right?

1192
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,227
Touch gloves
and go back to your corner.

1193
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:00,564
I'm gonna enjoy this.

1194
01:19:00,636 --> 01:19:02,900
I know I will.

1195
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,335
Pay attention.
Fake right and drop him.

1196
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:09,536
You are the baddest southpaw
ever were.

1197
01:19:09,612 --> 01:19:10,738
This man is a dog.

1198
01:19:10,813 --> 01:19:13,282
You gotta go fight your fight.

1199
01:19:13,349 --> 01:19:15,147
He does not belong
in the ring with you.

1200
01:19:15,217 --> 01:19:16,616
We got a lot of paper
riding on this thing, baby.

1201
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:18,949
-Sit your ass--Sit down!
-Let me--

1202
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:21,888
Remember what it took
to get here...

1203
01:19:21,957 --> 01:19:24,449
and remember who you are.

1204
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:26,551
Navajo Nation.

1205
01:20:05,901 --> 01:20:07,232
Yeah!

1206
01:20:12,875 --> 01:20:14,434
-Yes!
-That's it.

1207
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:24,646
Stay on him.

1208
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,831
Give me some more!

1209
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:42,533
Get off the ropes!

1210
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,806
Man, gotta cut him off.

1211
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:49,436
Break! Break! Break!

1212
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:51,809
Rocket, keep the punches up.
Let's go! Box!

1213
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,974
Yeah, Rocket!

1214
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:59,146
Come on, Black Cloud--Unh!
You ain't nothin'!

1215
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:00,188
Come on, honey.

1216
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:13,093
Stop! Stop!

1217
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:15,159
You're goin' down!
Go back to your tribe!

1218
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:18,673
Whoo! Whoo!
Cause I'm the best!

1219
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:24,008
He's fast. He's fast.

1220
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:25,308
You want to slow him down?

1221
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:27,247
Go to the body.
Use your right hand.

1222
01:21:27,316 --> 01:21:29,978
Every time he goes southpaw,
use your right hand.

1223
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:31,451
Step inside his jab
and hit him with that right.

1224
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,010
Knock his ass out.
He is a dog.

1225
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:35,216
He does not belong
in the ring with you.

1226
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:37,691
Look at me now. He's fast.

1227
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,195
You're strong. You go down.

1228
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:42,356
You take his right out
and go down on him.

1229
01:21:46,502 --> 01:21:47,901
Let's go, baby. Let's go.

1230
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:49,233
Game time.

1231
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:50,601
I got him.
He just don't know it yet.

1232
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:53,266
Stay out of the corner.
Keep your hands up on the break.

1233
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:22,870
That's it! Whoo!

1234
01:22:36,819 --> 01:22:38,583
-Down!
-Oh!

1235
01:22:40,322 --> 01:22:41,790
-Stay down! Stay down!
-One...

1236
01:22:41,857 --> 01:22:43,120
We can smell that money, baby!

1237
01:22:43,192 --> 01:22:44,284
Two...

1238
01:22:45,594 --> 01:22:48,222
-Stay down!
-Neutral corner!

1239
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:50,288
Three...

1240
01:22:50,365 --> 01:22:51,992
Four...

1241
01:22:53,469 --> 01:22:55,369
Five...
Get up. Get up.

1242
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:56,598
Six...

1243
01:22:58,307 --> 01:22:59,900
Seven...

1244
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:01,101
Let's do it!

1245
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:03,668
-Where are you?
-The championship!

1246
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:05,179
You ready to go? You OK?

1247
01:23:05,247 --> 01:23:06,942
-Uh-huh.
-All right.

1248
01:23:07,015 --> 01:23:08,278
BOX!

1249
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:14,520
Ha ha! You're done! Ha!

1250
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:19,687
So...you had enough?

1251
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:25,725
Black Cloud!

1252
01:23:50,459 --> 01:23:52,450
Stop! Stop!

1253
01:23:52,528 --> 01:23:54,155
Go to your corners!

1254
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:02,201
If that happens again,
I'm gonna stop the fight.

1255
01:24:02,271 --> 01:24:04,330
Let him decide it, ref.

1256
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:08,699
That didn't go so well, huh?

1257
01:24:08,777 --> 01:24:11,838
Didn't go so bad.
Still standing.

1258
01:24:11,914 --> 01:24:14,576
Breathe. Breathe.

1259
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:16,584
Any ideas?

1260
01:24:16,652 --> 01:24:19,417
How bad do you want it?

1261
01:24:22,324 --> 01:24:24,019
Then you gotta take it.

1262
01:24:30,165 --> 01:24:32,133
Come on, buddy! Let's go!

1263
01:24:36,672 --> 01:24:38,265
-How you fee
in'?
-I'm fee
in' good.

1264
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:39,933
-What's your name?
-I'm Rocket.

1265
01:24:40,008 --> 01:24:41,339
Get in there
and tear his ass apart.

1266
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:43,003
Go get him.

1267
01:24:59,394 --> 01:25:00,919
It's my turn!

1268
01:25:00,996 --> 01:25:04,125
You should've stayed down!
I'm gonna make you suffer!

1269
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,743
Yeah! Knock him down!

1270
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:23,816
Hit him with the left hook,
baby! The left hook!

1271
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:26,448
Knock him out, baby!

1272
01:25:38,834 --> 01:25:40,233
Yeah, Black Cloud!

1273
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:46,507
Got him now.

1274
01:26:22,444 --> 01:26:25,470
Down! Neutral corner!
Neutral corner!

1275
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:31,746
One...

1276
01:26:33,889 --> 01:26:36,551
Two...

1277
01:26:36,625 --> 01:26:37,786
Three...

1278
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:19,690
Hi, baby.

1279
01:27:19,768 --> 01:27:20,963
Mama?

1280
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:26,168
You're so beautiful, Mama.

1281
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:29,302
Just like I remember.

1282
01:27:29,377 --> 01:27:34,781
My time with you was short.
I was needed here.

1283
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:36,443
I need you.

1284
01:27:36,518 --> 01:27:39,044
I know, baby.

1285
01:27:39,121 --> 01:27:42,887
You're on the right path, son.
You'll find the way.

1286
01:27:42,958 --> 01:27:46,724
If darkness surrounds you,
ask your father in the sky...

1287
01:27:46,795 --> 01:27:48,957
and the way will be shown.

1288
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:52,762
I'm scared. I'm alone.

1289
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:55,565
You're never alone.

1290
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:58,197
Can I stay here with you?

1291
01:28:04,146 --> 01:28:07,138
ls it nice here?

1292
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:09,377
It's paradise.

1293
01:28:14,556 --> 01:28:16,354
Four...

1294
01:28:16,424 --> 01:28:17,949
It's hard back there.

1295
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:19,960
Five...

1296
01:28:20,028 --> 01:28:25,660
I know, baby.
You have much to accomplish.

1297
01:28:25,734 --> 01:28:28,203
You know I'm with you always.

1298
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:31,672
Now...go back.

1299
01:28:31,740 --> 01:28:34,869
Fulfill your destiny.

1300
01:28:35,911 --> 01:28:37,743
Can I see you again?

1301
01:28:37,813 --> 01:28:40,305
Anytime you need.

1302
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:46,383
Go, Black Cloud.

1303
01:28:52,727 --> 01:28:54,217
Go.

1304
01:28:58,567 --> 01:29:04,267
Six...

1305
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:07,240
Seven...

1306
01:29:08,276 --> 01:29:10,438
Eight...

1307
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:12,776
Nine!
You want to go on, kid?

1308
01:29:12,848 --> 01:29:14,839
Was Custer scared?

1309
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:16,384
Let's go. Box!

1310
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,084
Yeah!

1311
01:29:54,623 --> 01:29:56,148
Yeah! Stay on him!

1312
01:30:08,003 --> 01:30:09,164
N01

1313
01:30:45,874 --> 01:30:48,036
Whoo!

1314
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:50,077
.Ye$!
.Ye$!

1315
01:30:50,145 --> 01:30:52,910
Get up! I got too much paper
riding on you!

1316
01:30:58,586 --> 01:31:01,385
Whoo!

1317
01:31:07,929 --> 01:31:09,419
You're champion!

1318
01:31:09,497 --> 01:31:11,591
Where the hell's
the Olympics anyways?

1319
01:31:13,201 --> 01:31:16,660
You were right.
My mom is beautiful.

1320
01:32:09,024 --> 01:32:12,187
Mile upon mile got no direction

1321
01:32:13,561 --> 01:32:17,020
We're all playing the same game

1322
01:32:18,333 --> 01:32:21,234
We're all 
ookin' for redemption

1323
01:32:22,737 --> 01:32:26,037
Just afraid to say the name

1324
01:32:27,609 --> 01:32:30,670
So caught up now in pretending

1325
01:32:32,047 --> 01:32:35,210
What we're seeking is the truth

1326
01:32:36,684 --> 01:32:39,813
I'm just looking
for a happy ending

1327
01:32:41,623 --> 01:32:44,388
All I'm looking for is you

1328
01:32:46,594 --> 01:32:50,394
YOLI came LIpOl'l I116 wave OI'! wave

1329
01:32:50,465 --> 01:32:54,527
You're the reason I'm still here

1330
01:32:56,071 --> 01:33:00,008
Am I the one
you were sent to save?

1331
01:33:00,075 --> 01:33:04,672
When you came upon me
wave on wave

1332
01:33:04,746 --> 01:33:07,477
I wandered out into the water

1333
01:33:09,818 --> 01:33:12,719
And I thought that I might drown

1334
01:33:14,456 --> 01:33:18,620
I don't know what I was after

1335
01:33:18,693 --> 01:33:22,129
Just knew I was going down

1336
01:33:23,565 --> 01:33:26,660
That's when she found me

1337
01:33:27,735 --> 01:33:31,069
Not afraid anymore

1338
01:33:33,041 --> 01:33:36,636
You said, "You know,
I always had you, baby"

1339
01:33:36,711 --> 01:33:40,545
"Just waiting for you to find
what you were looking for"

1340
01:33:42,183 --> 01:33:46,484
YOLI came LIpOl'l I116 wave OI'! wave

1341
01:33:46,554 --> 01:33:51,424
You're the reason I'm still here

1342
01:33:51,493 --> 01:33:55,862
Am I the one
you were sent to save?

1343
01:33:55,930 --> 01:34:00,663
And you came upon me
wave on wave

1344
01:34:00,735 --> 01:34:05,172
YOLI came LIpOl'l I116 wave OI'! wave

1345
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:10,007
You're the reason I'm still here

1346
01:34:10,078 --> 01:34:14,481
Am I the one
you were sent to save?

1347
01:34:14,549 --> 01:34:17,575
You came upon me wave by wave

1348
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:18,983
Wave on

1349
01:34:31,533 --> 01:34:34,730
I fell by the wayside

1350
01:34:34,802 --> 01:34:38,204
I fell on my knees

1351
01:34:38,273 --> 01:34:39,570
Crying

1352
01:34:39,641 --> 01:34:45,171
Why was I so hard to please?

1353
01:34:47,649 --> 01:34:50,118
I stood at the crossroads

1354
01:34:50,185 --> 01:34:55,419
Took a long look at me

1355
01:34:55,490 --> 01:35:00,929
Sometimes you don't know where
you're from till you leave

1356
01:35:03,798 --> 01:35:07,496
And I been out there searchin'

1357
01:35:07,569 --> 01:35:11,802
For a place where I belong

1358
01:35:11,873 --> 01:35:18,040
And on my way I heard my song

1359
01:35:18,112 --> 01:35:25,041
Let it sing me home

1360
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:30,116
Sun on my shoulders

1361
01:35:30,191 --> 01:35:35,152
And the wind at my back

1362
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:40,396
Bound and determined
to get back on track

1363
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:47,030
To where the heart is

1364
01:35:47,108 --> 01:35:51,306
Where it's been all along

1365
01:35:51,379 --> 01:35:56,749
Sometimes you don't know what
you've got till it's gone

1366
01:35:56,818 --> 01:35:59,287
Gone, gone, gone

1367
01:35:59,354 --> 01:36:03,814
And I been out there searchin'

1368
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:07,589
For a place where I belong

1369
01:36:07,662 --> 01:36:13,601
And on my way I heard my song

1370
01:36:13,668 --> 01:36:21,337
Let it sing me home
