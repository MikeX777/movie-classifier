1
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:35,693
- Flowers!
- Yay!

2
00:00:35,724 --> 00:00:37,613
Thank you. They're
beautiful, baby. Thank you.

3
00:00:37,644 --> 00:00:39,917
- Yeah, you like it?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:43,341
Did you pack?

5
00:00:43,373 --> 00:00:45,996
- Mm...
- Oh, come on, I left a note.

6
00:00:46,028 --> 00:00:48,365
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I saw the note, Carl.

7
00:00:48,397 --> 00:00:49,677
Uh...

8
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:52,142
"Pack the cooler, pick out
a cute outfit for the road,

9
00:00:52,173 --> 00:00:55,053
and, hey, sneak in a winter jog
if you feel like it."

10
00:00:55,086 --> 00:00:57,261
The last part pissed me off,
so I didn't do anything.

11
00:00:57,294 --> 00:00:58,798
It was a josh!

12
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,327
I'm really excited about
this weekend.

13
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,590
Oh, God, don't.
You have bad breath.

14
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:09,998
Disgusting.

15
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:20,528
Super excited.

16
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:22,448
Gonna give it to her this
weekend at a bed & breakfast.

17
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,328
- Congratulations, by the way.
- Thanks. Actually, we're

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,593
We just were so broke back then
we couldn't afford the rings.

19
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:31,632
I see. So, you had a cash bar
at the wedding and shit?

20
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:35,056
Are you crazy?

21
00:01:35,089 --> 00:01:36,977
After 10, yeah.
- Yeah.

22
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:42,385
Dad! Fuck, please,
I'm with a client here.

23
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:44,434
It looks very bad.

24
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:45,553
Get in the back, please.
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:45,586 --> 00:01:48,594
- No...
- When they get older,

26
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:50,675
He's like a little vegetable
with glasses.

27
00:01:56,146 --> 00:01:59,219
Ugh!

28
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:21,652
Unh! Hey, have you guys heard

29
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:24,341
anything about
the design position?

30
00:02:24,373 --> 00:02:26,613
Yes! You didn't get it.
They read

31
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:28,853
the part on your resume
that says you're retarded.

32
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:32,790
- Ah.
- But I did hear that

33
00:02:32,822 --> 00:02:35,702
- at E Arts in Vancouver.
- Here we go.

34
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:38,550
Robyn Leffurn, yes.

35
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,374
How is that boner machine?
- What?

36
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:42,742
You know what
a boner machine is, right?

37
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:46,647
- No.
- Oh. It's a machine that makes

38
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,191
So, five years later and we're
still hearing about your ex.

39
00:02:51,223 --> 00:02:55,927
- Yeah, I'm aware.
- So, you excited

40
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,848
Yes, I'm so excited.

41
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,736
I'm... beyond.

42
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:02,200
Ah, I'm jealous.
My weekend plans consist of

43
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:04,632
trying to stop Doug
from eating wheat and sugar.

44
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:06,968
- Diet?
- It's a yeast infection.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,361
We've been passing one back
and forth like a hot potato.

46
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:13,753
That's nice.
It's nice to share.

47
00:03:13,784 --> 00:03:15,993
And with that,
I bid you adieu.

48
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:19,290
- Bye.
- You have fun.

49
00:03:21,754 --> 00:03:25,562
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

50
00:03:25,594 --> 00:03:27,321
I don't know.

51
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:43,707
Uh. Oh, now you're in for it.

52
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:05,981
Fabulous conducting.
- Why, thank you.

53
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:08,189
So, Ryan's

54
00:04:08,221 --> 00:04:11,902
emailed me the ski route
to Sainte-Adle for the

55
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:13,950
It looks like it's gonna be
an awesome workout.

56
00:04:13,981 --> 00:04:18,205
Oh, cool, 'cause all I wanna
do this weekend is exercise.

57
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,303
That he gave us the best room
in the B&B, the Lovers' Suite?

58
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:25,183
- That's what it's called?
- That's what it's called.

59
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,992
So, still no word yet

60
00:04:29,023 --> 00:04:31,071
on the promotion.
Can you believe that?

61
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,216
- When are they gonna decide?
- They can't keep me

62
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:36,896
on the floor
forever. It's like...

63
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:39,008
on local cheeses
while we're here.

64
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,504
Local cheeses!

65
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:44,864
Let's get some cheese
up in this bitch.

66
00:04:57,249 --> 00:05:01,058
Is there where you murder me
and stuff me in the trunk?

67
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,810
This is where we tear
each other's clothes off

68
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:06,370
and make passionate love
to each other.

69
00:05:06,402 --> 00:05:08,674
- Oooh.
- Yeah.

70
00:05:10,563 --> 00:05:12,994
All right, let me
just pee first.

71
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:19,075
Ah!

72
00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:30,596
Hey!

73
00:05:32,484 --> 00:05:34,148
Do we have any Kleenex?

74
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:36,517
Uh...

75
00:05:36,548 --> 00:05:38,629
there's a paper bag
back here.

76
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,229
Ew!

77
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:42,149
I think I have a receipt
in my wallet.

78
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:43,941
- Hilarious.
- Ha! Ha! Ha! Hurry up!

79
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:46,533
How'd you know
this place was here?

80
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:48,198
Uh... all these vin...

81
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:51,718
these little vineyards have
hideaways like this.

82
00:05:53,446 --> 00:05:56,133
Drip dry.

83
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,206
Ah!

84
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:00,295
Don't slam the door.

85
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:01,926
Why do you always slam the door?
That's a woman thing.

86
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:05,383
Oh, is the car gonna break,
Carl? Is it gonna break?

87
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:07,654
Here, take one of these.
Can you put the pumps on?

88
00:06:07,687 --> 00:06:09,383
- Oh!
- I'm sorry.

89
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:11,720
Put 'em on, put 'em on,
put 'em on.

90
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:15,464
Mmm. Watch the seats. Here.

91
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:18,536
No, no, no.
I wanna keep it on.

92
00:06:18,568 --> 00:06:20,457
No, I just got a really
not so great bikini wax.

93
00:06:20,488 --> 00:06:22,856
Yeah, I don't care, I don't
care about the little bumps.

94
00:06:22,888 --> 00:06:24,648
From behind.

95
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:27,497
- Ow!
- Ooh, uh, sorry. OK, ready?

96
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:29,065
Yeah.

97
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:33,097
Oh, God.
- 'K, let's come fast, OK?

98
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:35,337
Please don't take
like half an hour again.

99
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:37,417
OK.

100
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:39,178
Oh, God.

101
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:41,610
Oh, fuck. Shit, Sue.

102
00:06:41,642 --> 00:06:42,826
Ah.

103
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:45,097
Oh, does it feel good?
- Yeah.

104
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,826
- Yeah, you fuckin' like that?
- Yeah.

105
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:49,099
- Yeah, you fuckin' like that?
- Carl, shut up. Yes.

106
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,858
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

107
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:57,804
You can do it, Carl.

108
00:07:03,532 --> 00:07:06,380
Tell me how you were
waiting for me.

109
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:08,940
Uh, OK. Um...

110
00:07:08,972 --> 00:07:11,341
So, you're on a skidoo,

111
00:07:11,372 --> 00:07:15,340
and, uh, you come across me
in the forest,

112
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:19,501
a little ski bunny that needs
a big lollipop to suck.

113
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:21,741
Oh, hello.

114
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:24,014
Can I give you a ride?

115
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:25,389
Yeah, OK.

116
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:29,870
Um, I'm your wife's dumber
and hornier cousin from Italy.

117
00:07:29,902 --> 00:07:32,463
Uh, me no speak-a no English.
- Oh, don't do that.

118
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,670
- Me no speak-a English.
- Why are you doing that?

119
00:07:34,702 --> 00:07:38,223
Sorry. You wanna spray
my snowsuit?

120
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:40,494
Oh, yeah,
spray your face.

121
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,223
And, uh, luckily,

122
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:45,904
you put my hand on a language
everybody understands:

123
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:48,303
A big, hard, throbbing

124
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,128
American cock.

125
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:02,576
I'm sorry,
I just couldn't...

126
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,945
It's OK.

127
00:08:04,977 --> 00:08:07,376
It's nice to get the feeling
back in my legs.

128
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,668
This is adorable!
- Yeah, you like it?

129
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,740
- Yeah. Eee!
- Head on in,

130
00:08:46,772 --> 00:08:49,748
I'll get the bags.
- Thank God for my sweater.

131
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,668
Yeah, bitch.

132
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,632
The one thing I won't renovate
is the Lovers' Suite.

133
00:09:28,664 --> 00:09:30,903
I mean, you'll see.
It has so much charm,

134
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:33,528
- it's like going back in time.
- Cool, cool.

135
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,113
So, should I take the stairs,
or my DeLorean to get there?

136
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:50,361
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

137
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:53,594
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

138
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,130
What the hell are you
doing here?

139
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,946
What's the deal?
You guys know each other?

140
00:09:57,977 --> 00:10:00,346
Yeah, uh... Yeah, uh,

141
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:02,970
Robyn used to be my boss.
- Really?

142
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,530
- Yeah.
- Wait. Robyn?

143
00:10:05,562 --> 00:10:08,250
I thought... Robyn?
I thought your name was Ryan.

144
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:12,859
Whoa. You're Ryan?
You're the Ryan I've

145
00:10:12,891 --> 00:10:15,931
I can't believe
that you're the Carl.

146
00:10:15,964 --> 00:10:19,579
I mean, you are an excellent
speller, by the way.

147
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,476
Well, jeez, come here.
I mean, it's

148
00:10:24,508 --> 00:10:26,524
amazing to see you. It's, uh...
- Yeah.

149
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:34,045
Hi, I'm Sue,

150
00:10:34,077 --> 00:10:36,221
this man's wife.
- Yes, wife, her.

151
00:10:36,253 --> 00:10:37,469
Yeah.

152
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:39,678
Hi.
- You are stunning.

153
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:41,565
- Oh.
- I mean, really.

154
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:43,485
You walked through the door,
and I was like,

155
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,406
"Wow. Am I working
at a supermodel agency?"

156
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:48,830
Oh, my God. Thank you.

157
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:50,206
Can we rewind
real quick?

158
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,566
Why are you
calling yourself Ryan?

159
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,055
That's really embarrassing.

160
00:10:57,087 --> 00:11:02,239
Um, I guess that it's
just all part of the new me,

161
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,967
along with simple problems

162
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:08,256
like fixing broken
drainage pipes and making beds.

163
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:10,400
I don't...
I don't get it.

164
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:14,145
I bought this place.

165
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:17,409
You what?

166
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:20,385
What about Vancouver?

167
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,841
Your job? Did I hear you quit?
- Ah, I just needed a break.

168
00:11:23,873 --> 00:11:26,722
I mean, the plan is
to give this lodge a facelift

169
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:29,217
and then give it to my parents
as a retirement gift.

170
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:31,458
- Wow, that's amazing of you.
- I have no idea

171
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,442
what I'm doing.

172
00:11:33,474 --> 00:11:34,818
Like, I am learning,

173
00:11:34,849 --> 00:11:37,091
one hammered thumb at a time.
- So, what,

174
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:39,203
it's been like five years
last October?

175
00:11:39,234 --> 00:11:41,378
I think, I think.
- Oh, uh,

176
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:44,003
or something like that.
- Yeah. You look great.

177
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:46,211
Oh, my God.
I'm totally breaking out.

178
00:11:46,243 --> 00:11:49,699
I mean, flashback to grade 10
yearbook photo. Mortified.

179
00:11:51,684 --> 00:11:53,571
Let me get the room key.

180
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:03,332
Shit. This is work.
It's a file error.

181
00:12:03,364 --> 00:12:06,564
- Sounds interesting.
- I'll help Susan with the bags.

182
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:08,452
It's Sue. Sue.

183
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:12,100
Haven't changed my name yet.

184
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:21,446
Hmm.

185
00:12:23,174 --> 00:12:24,869
Hey.

186
00:12:24,902 --> 00:12:27,845
Is here, at the fucking lodge
we're staying at!

187
00:12:27,878 --> 00:12:31,622
What the fuck?!
Oh, my God, what?!

188
00:12:31,654 --> 00:12:34,919
Excuse me, lady,
what occurred here?

189
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,287
Is this turning you on? Should
I call the wet police? What?

190
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:39,174
Carl, where are you?

191
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:41,608
I'm in the Laurentians.

192
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,135
I don't know. I'm at, uh,
just some area here.

193
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:47,111
Oh, my God, Carl.

194
00:12:47,144 --> 00:12:49,639
- Stacey, just... just stop.
- No. No!

195
00:12:49,672 --> 00:12:52,040
No, no, no, no, no.
I can explain this, OK?

196
00:12:52,073 --> 00:12:53,736
Consider this your cold
shower, Your Horniness.

197
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:56,552
What is she
doing there anyway?

198
00:12:56,584 --> 00:13:00,104
With the owner, and the owner
turns out to be her.

199
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:02,601
She bought a ski lodge? What?
- I mean, of all the ski lodges,

200
00:13:02,634 --> 00:13:05,481
why the fuck
would she buy this one?

201
00:13:05,514 --> 00:13:08,937
Ask you the same question.
Why? Why, out of the all the ski

202
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:11,049
- Take Sue where?
- Doug, you gotta shut up.

203
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,122
No, you better
shut your fuckin' mouth.

204
00:13:14,154 --> 00:13:16,617
Perfect lately, and...
and I just thought

205
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,698
that this might spark something
for us, you know?

206
00:13:25,643 --> 00:13:28,652
Apply this.
- Aha, OK.

207
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,731
But so we're clear,
it was your oven

208
00:13:30,764 --> 00:13:33,323
that leavened my bread.
- Carl?

209
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:35,756
- Yeah, what was I saying?
- [Um, something about

210
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:37,899
to a ski lodge that was
your romantic getaway

211
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:42,124
with another woman.
- What?!

212
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:44,748
We should leave. I should
cancel the trip, shouldn't I?

213
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:48,204
What are you gonna tell her?

214
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,149
You get back in there,
you have the weekend

215
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,125
you planned, because that is
all you can do, Carl.

216
00:13:54,156 --> 00:13:56,269
Just answer your phone.

217
00:14:29,872 --> 00:14:31,536
: Hi.

218
00:14:31,568 --> 00:14:33,265
Hey. What do you think?

219
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:35,185
- I love it.
- Yeah, it's great, right?

220
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:37,424
- Is everything good at work?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

221
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:40,497
I sorted out the, uh,
file error.

222
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:42,737
The reception sucks
up here, though.

223
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:45,650
Isn't this place cute,
Carlito's Way?

224
00:14:45,681 --> 00:14:47,057
Answer: Yes.

225
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:52,338
Hey, uh, you're not gonna
believe this. I forgot my boots.

226
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,290
- You're kidding me.
- It's all these heels

227
00:14:54,322 --> 00:14:57,010
you made me bring,
you fuckin' perv.

228
00:14:57,042 --> 00:15:01,203
Shit. We'll just go into town
tomorrow and we'll get you

229
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,979
Um, hey, do you want to go
into town tonight maybe?

230
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,931
And get dinner?

231
00:15:06,963 --> 00:15:09,460
Really? You've been talking

232
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,795
about this place's
confit de canard all week.

233
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,524
Well, I don't know.

234
00:15:13,555 --> 00:15:15,667
I don't wanna get
back in the car, babe.

235
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,220
It's dark and we don't know
where we're going.

236
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,916
Hey, uh, what...

237
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:23,476
what... what was your deal
down there?

238
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:25,589
Why were you acting so weird?
- Is this shirt...

239
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:27,829
is this too urban?
What do you think?

240
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,164
Would you just stand still
for a second? What's your deal

241
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,533
with Ryan - Robyn?

242
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:36,981
What is that?
- Oh. Uh... yeah.

243
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:41,397
Well, full disclosure:
We used to date.

244
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,862
...inanimate
objects. I...

245
00:15:46,966 --> 00:15:49,078
Robyn dated you?

246
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:53,366
The tone seems
like you're shocked.

247
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,727
Well, how long
did you guys go out for?

248
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,647
I don't know. Honestly, I don't
really remember.

249
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:01,879
I was mostly just shocked
at how much she's aged.

250
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:03,608
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

251
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:06,359
She's beautiful.
I... I can't imagine

252
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:09,208
what she looked like before
if she's aged.

253
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,144
She's OK. She's not, uh...
ho-ho-ho!

254
00:16:15,737 --> 00:16:17,849
So, why have I never heard
of this person before?

255
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,721
Oh, no, I have definitely
mentioned her before. You

256
00:16:21,753 --> 00:16:24,409
No. No, no.
You never mentioned her.

257
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,841
Well, it just never came up.
You know.

258
00:16:26,873 --> 00:16:30,490
Younger people talk
about their exes. That's

259
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,970
So, I'm assuming
that you slept with her?

260
00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:37,883
We were adults
at the time,

261
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:40,475
so yeah.
- Amazing.

262
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:42,203
But it was
totally forgettable.

263
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,475
I mean, she's just...
she's one of those pretty women

264
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:46,236
who doesn't know
how to be sexy.

265
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:49,596
And for the record, I had no
idea that I was emailing

266
00:16:49,627 --> 00:16:54,844
She was signing her emails
"Ryan," which is just bizarre.

267
00:16:54,877 --> 00:16:55,804
Who does that?

268
00:16:55,837 --> 00:16:57,564
I don't know. Ryan.

269
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,501
All right, well...
- Well, hold on.

270
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:10,141
I mean, she must have known
that she was emailing

271
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:11,582
No, I used
my Hotmail account.

272
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:15,006
I use my Hotmail account
when I book to avoid spam.

273
00:17:17,693 --> 00:17:18,494
This is weird.

274
00:17:18,526 --> 00:17:21,118
We should... we should
change lodges.

275
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,038
No, it's nobody's fault.

276
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,086
I understand.
It must be

277
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,839
super weird running into her.
- I want you to be comfortable.

278
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,759
- No, I... Yeah.
- I want you to be comfortable,

279
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,223
and I want this weekend
to be awesome.

280
00:17:32,254 --> 00:17:33,791
- I'm fine if you are.
- Really?

281
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:36,863
- Yeah, yeah.
- You're amazing.

282
00:17:36,895 --> 00:17:40,351
I know I am.
I am soooo cool.

283
00:17:40,384 --> 00:17:42,112
You're not cool.

284
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:46,176
You're amazing. This sweater
does not make you cool.

285
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:53,088
All right, all right.

286
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,833
Get the door.
Just watch your head.

287
00:17:56,864 --> 00:17:57,953
- Seriously, stop it.
- Feel the rhythm.

288
00:17:57,985 --> 00:18:01,601
Stop making me laugh.
I will drop you, I swear to God.

289
00:18:10,146 --> 00:18:12,354
- Bonjour.
- Bonsoir.

290
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:14,914
Bonsoir.

291
00:18:14,947 --> 00:18:17,667
: What the fuck?

292
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:20,227
- What's up? Are you OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

293
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:27,715
No, no, no, no.

294
00:18:27,747 --> 00:18:30,020
Are you staying here?

295
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:33,796
Oh, bonjour. Je suis Sue.

296
00:18:33,828 --> 00:18:35,940
- Lise Winters. Enchantée.
- Enchantée.

297
00:18:37,668 --> 00:18:39,557
- Enchantée.
- Hi!

298
00:18:39,588 --> 00:18:41,604
Hi! Mwah, mwah!
I'm Carl.

299
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:43,653
- Carl. This is Carl.
- Hey, how's it going?

300
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:47,685
Hey. Oh, hey. You too.
- Please, sit, sit. It would

301
00:18:47,717 --> 00:18:49,797
- Really? Yeah?
- Ah, yes, join us.

302
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,621
OK. All right. Uh...

303
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,958
Carl's American,
hence the perfect accent.

304
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,517
Well, I wish I could
play music, but...

305
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,918
Babe, Anatolii is
an actor.

306
00:19:02,951 --> 00:19:04,998
He's amazing.
I just saw that, uh,

307
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,887
that French film you did.
You were...

308
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:09,415
- Naked for most of it.
- That too.

309
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:13,320
- Ah, he was naked.
- I'll take the credit.

310
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:15,399
- Well done. Good body.
- Ha, ha. Well,

311
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:17,799
well, I'm already a fan
of your turtleneck,

312
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:19,623
so I'm sure... so I'm sure

313
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:21,384
I'd be a fan
of your work.

314
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,752
Do you guys have any, uh,
any plan for the weekend, or?

315
00:19:23,785 --> 00:19:26,888
Oh, yes. We are
going on a vineyard tour.

316
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,545
A hard look at what activities
we both enjoy...

317
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:34,921
Sounds good.

318
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,122
Shut up. I love her.
- Oh, I adore her.

319
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:52,234
- I love her.
- Who is she?

320
00:20:04,075 --> 00:20:06,924
Wow.

321
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,972
Well, it sounds compelling.

322
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,036
- Yeah, excellent.
- I like your pumps. I have

323
00:20:17,068 --> 00:20:20,365
I have to pee! Sorry, I have
to get the pee out of my body.

324
00:20:20,397 --> 00:20:22,028
Preferably in a toilet.

325
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:25,485
Um, upstairs, first door
on the left.

326
00:20:25,517 --> 00:20:27,405
Fantastic.
All right, I'll be back.

327
00:20:27,437 --> 00:20:29,549
: I'll
be back.

328
00:20:29,581 --> 00:20:31,886
Let me clear
your plates.

329
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:51,375
- Hi. Tell me everything.
- She seems like she's doing

330
00:20:51,407 --> 00:20:53,231
really great. She's still
the most annoying person

331
00:20:53,264 --> 00:20:56,655
Is she still a boner machine?

332
00:20:56,687 --> 00:20:59,279
But it's funny, I can
see why it didn't work out.

333
00:20:59,312 --> 00:21:02,577
No... Babe, I can't
hear anything. What should I do?

334
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:06,288
I think you should shut the
fuck up while I'm doing yoga.

335
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,272
Carl?

336
00:21:08,305 --> 00:21:09,969
I need you, OK? I need...

337
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,825
Wait a second, what?

338
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:16,785
...emergency.
- Huh? What do you mean

339
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,705
...emergency.

340
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:20,786
I gotta go.

341
00:21:20,818 --> 00:21:23,473
Oh. Sorry.

342
00:21:23,506 --> 00:21:26,930
Don't say you're sorry, man.
It's a sign of weakness.

343
00:21:28,658 --> 00:21:30,770
Thanks for the tip.

344
00:21:37,427 --> 00:21:39,347
Hello?

345
00:21:41,427 --> 00:21:43,667
I call that
a perfect dismount,

346
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:45,587
no thanks to you
and your mouth.

347
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:51,252
What the fuck?

348
00:21:54,164 --> 00:21:56,437
Oh, my God.

349
00:21:58,837 --> 00:22:01,109
- Hi.
- Hey.

350
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:03,285
Ryan's gonna eat with us.
- Oh.

351
00:22:03,317 --> 00:22:05,301
I... I don't want
to spoil your dinner.

352
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:08,469
No, you're not, you're not.
She's was gonna eat alone

353
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:11,926
I've run out of conversation
topics with the fridge

354
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:15,190
- Ah.
- Relax, Carl. Sit.

355
00:22:15,221 --> 00:22:16,950
Yeah, yes.

356
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:19,415
Let's relax.

357
00:22:19,446 --> 00:22:23,766
Mm, so, this is
a local cabernet,

358
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,782
and it goes best
with the entire bottle.

359
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:28,503
Would you like some?
- Oh, no thanks. I don't drink.

360
00:22:28,535 --> 00:22:32,023
- OK.
- No, I'm good,

361
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:35,832
a question. Why does Anatolii
have a different accent

362
00:22:35,864 --> 00:22:38,712
He's been working in France
since he was a teenager.

363
00:22:38,744 --> 00:22:41,561
He's still a teenager.

364
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:44,760
- Jailbait.
- Word.

365
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:46,904
Gross. Both of you.
Very gross.

366
00:22:49,337 --> 00:22:52,217
So... can you believe

367
00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:54,425
that I'm sitting here with you

368
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:58,714
and your drop-dead-gorgeous
wife?

369
00:22:58,746 --> 00:23:00,634
It's pretty surreal.

370
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:03,290
So, tell me,
how are things at work?

371
00:23:03,321 --> 00:23:05,882
- Yeah, good.
- I mean,

372
00:23:05,914 --> 00:23:07,706
you must be...

373
00:23:07,738 --> 00:23:10,810
one of the top dogs
by now, no?

374
00:23:12,538 --> 00:23:14,906
Well, you know,
there's a lot of, uh...

375
00:23:14,938 --> 00:23:17,818
politics there, and we're not
really developing anything new.

376
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:21,755
Why... am I defending myself?

377
00:23:21,788 --> 00:23:23,740
You're doing great, baby.

378
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:25,660
So, uh, so,

379
00:23:25,692 --> 00:23:28,187
riddle me this:
What's your deal?

380
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,972
Are you single? Divorced?
Are you, uh...

381
00:23:31,004 --> 00:23:32,892
Is there a Mr. Ryan

382
00:23:32,924 --> 00:23:35,613
back in, uh, BC,
or what?

383
00:23:35,644 --> 00:23:37,821
I am...

384
00:23:37,852 --> 00:23:40,253
comically single.

385
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,365
So, you never settled down?

386
00:23:42,397 --> 00:23:43,709
Well,

387
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,101
I recently made the mistake
of dating someone from work,

388
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,662
and when it started
to fizzle,

389
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,189
he started talking
about our private life

390
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,870
in front of everyone,
and completely humiliated me,

391
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:58,751
and ejaculated
all over my office.

392
00:23:58,782 --> 00:24:01,854
- Are you serious?
- He masturbated

393
00:24:01,886 --> 00:24:04,319
into a picture frame
and left it on my desk.

394
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:06,399
: Oh!

395
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:10,944
Romantic. Wow. I'm sorry.
That's terrible.

396
00:24:10,976 --> 00:24:12,927
- Awful.
- Yeah.

397
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,024
I was never cut out
for a husband and kids.

398
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:18,752
I'm a loner.

399
00:24:18,784 --> 00:24:21,792
Yeah, you're
like Julian Assange,

400
00:24:21,824 --> 00:24:24,673
living out of a backpack
and changing the world, right?

401
00:24:24,704 --> 00:24:27,585
- Who's Julian Assange again?
- Ah.

402
00:24:27,616 --> 00:24:30,721
Twenty-four-year-olds get their
news from Perez Hilton, so...

403
00:24:30,753 --> 00:24:34,561
Julian Assange is WikiLeaks.
He's the guy who...

404
00:24:34,593 --> 00:24:36,802
Yeah, I know what it is, Carl.
I just forgot his name.

405
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:39,650
- You're cute.
- Fuck you.

406
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:50,274
Did you notice
that she didn't ask us

407
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:52,482
one single question
at that meal?

408
00:24:52,515 --> 00:24:55,267
It was completely 100%
about her, like the whole time.

409
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:57,507
- I know.
- Yeah, yeah.

410
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,395
Unbelievable.

411
00:24:59,427 --> 00:25:01,475
It seems like she has
a very interesting life.

412
00:25:01,507 --> 00:25:04,387
Nobody's ever jacked off
into one of my picture frames.

413
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,468
I'll jack off
in your picture frame.

414
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,708
: Carl, get off.

415
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,756
I'll hit you.
- Uh, also,

416
00:25:10,788 --> 00:25:13,253
what right does she have
to criticize me about my work?

417
00:25:13,285 --> 00:25:16,325
It's like, I'm sorry, Ryan,
if I'm not as successful

418
00:25:16,357 --> 00:25:19,974
- She's so skinny.
- Yeah.

419
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,549
Are you still
attracted to me?

420
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:26,277
Am I still
attracted to you?

421
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,317
Are you kidding me?
You're like perfect.

422
00:25:29,349 --> 00:25:32,198
- I need to work out more.
- No, you don't.

423
00:25:32,229 --> 00:25:35,910
What are you talking about?
I'm so attracted to you.

424
00:25:35,942 --> 00:25:38,151
Look at me,
look at that.

425
00:25:38,182 --> 00:25:40,390
We could camp under it.

426
00:25:40,423 --> 00:25:42,631
Yeah.
- It's a cool cock, babe.

427
00:25:42,663 --> 00:25:44,551
- Thanks.
- Cool.

428
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:46,792
- Well...
- Cool stuff.

429
00:25:46,823 --> 00:25:48,712
Honk.
- Mm.

430
00:25:48,743 --> 00:25:50,824
Honking a boner.
Doesn't quite work.

431
00:25:50,855 --> 00:25:52,552
Yeah.

432
00:26:00,264 --> 00:26:02,313
Hey, hey,
did you see this?

433
00:26:02,345 --> 00:26:04,392
Have you seen this?

434
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:06,792
No, what am I looking at?
What is that?

435
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:08,520
We should
carve our names into it.

436
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:11,401
- No.
- Look, Sailor

437
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:13,674
- No, I don't like it.
- Why not? Come on.

438
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:15,754
It's like... it's like
defacing the place.

439
00:26:15,786 --> 00:26:17,674
- Are you joking?
- No, I'm not joking.

440
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:19,594
You're such a wiener.
Who are you?

441
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:22,314
- I didn't bring a knife, hon.
- I'm sure we can find a knife.

442
00:26:22,346 --> 00:26:25,098
No, it's cheesy. Mmm.

443
00:26:30,187 --> 00:26:32,075
I'm tired. I'm just tired.

444
00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:35,403
We haven't even christened
the room yet.

445
00:26:35,435 --> 00:26:39,243
OK, I know, but I just feel
like one failed attempt

446
00:26:39,275 --> 00:26:42,027
in one day is enough for me,
you know what I mean?

447
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,396
Is that OK?

448
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:46,636
- That was bitchy.
- Babe.

449
00:26:46,668 --> 00:26:50,060
No, I didn't realize I was
vacationing with a cold fish.

450
00:26:51,948 --> 00:26:55,276
Wow. Really?

451
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:57,484
I'm sorry,
I'm just disappointed.

452
00:26:59,277 --> 00:27:02,126
You know what, if it was gonna
be fast, I'd be down,

453
00:27:02,157 --> 00:27:04,781
but lately sex has become
such a production with you.

454
00:27:04,814 --> 00:27:08,622
It's annoying that I always have
to recite that fantasy

455
00:27:08,654 --> 00:27:10,958
in this baby porno voice.
- You don't have to dissect

456
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,734
our sex lives. OK, you like
specific shit too.

457
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,775
- Yeah, sure, I do, but...
- Yeah, I know you do!

458
00:27:17,806 --> 00:27:19,566
- Yeah!
- Your tastes are very

459
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:21,486
repetitive. I feel
like I'm in a Broadway play

460
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:25,007
that's been running for 3 years.
- Bravo, babe.

461
00:27:26,543 --> 00:27:28,975
Sometimes a woman just needs
to be fucked by her man,

462
00:27:29,008 --> 00:27:32,911
so she feels
like he can't help it.

463
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,864
Preferably in under an hour.

464
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:41,520
I'm sorry
I'm so inadequate.

465
00:27:45,777 --> 00:27:49,073
This is a good look.

466
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:51,153
Let's just watch some Conan
and go to bed.

467
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,569
Ha!

468
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,585
- Hey.
- Hi. Hey.

469
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:24,089
Hey.

470
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:26,137
Aw, geez Louise,
you look beautiful.

471
00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:28,570
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.

472
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,650
And you lost
your dead grandma's sweater.

473
00:29:30,682 --> 00:29:34,202
Thank you so much.
You're so sweet. I love them.

474
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:35,450
What do you love?

475
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,073
* Da-da-da ding, da-da-da-da
ding, ding ding-ding-a-ding *

476
00:29:38,106 --> 00:29:39,578
Where'd you get those?

477
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,842
Am I interrupting
a make-out session?

478
00:29:42,874 --> 00:29:45,018
No, no making out,

479
00:29:45,051 --> 00:29:46,522
as far as I'm aware.

480
00:29:46,554 --> 00:29:48,282
Tell me they fit.

481
00:29:50,011 --> 00:29:52,410
Wait a sec,
you got these for me?

482
00:29:52,443 --> 00:29:55,867
I mean, I had to go
into town anyway, so...

483
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,555
Wow.

484
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,963
How did you know
that she needed boots?

485
00:29:59,995 --> 00:30:03,740
Oh, the rooms are bugged.

486
00:30:03,772 --> 00:30:05,213
: I'm just kidding.

487
00:30:05,244 --> 00:30:07,133
Sue told me last night.
- I can't believe

488
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:10,845
you did that. That's, like,
the sweetest thing ever.

489
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:12,765
Prego, grazie, it's not-a

490
00:30:12,797 --> 00:30:14,973
big-a deal.

491
00:30:15,005 --> 00:30:18,269
- Uh, what's with the pails?
- Oh, I'm going to the maple

492
00:30:18,301 --> 00:30:21,693
syrup factory. I mean, the barn
with a couple of pots in it.

493
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:24,606
- You make your own maple syrup?
- Well,

494
00:30:24,638 --> 00:30:30,079
it's a dream my dad had,
so I'm trying to figure it out.

495
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,327
You do, like,
everything.

496
00:30:31,358 --> 00:30:33,247
Yeah, that's, like...
that's wild.

497
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:35,199
- Is it a complicated process?
- If you

498
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,855
help me out, I'll teach you
everything I know.

499
00:30:37,887 --> 00:30:41,663
We'll be
two and a half minutes, Carl.

500
00:30:41,696 --> 00:30:43,456
- Very funny.
- Yeah, I mean, I could...

501
00:30:43,487 --> 00:30:45,376
You should go, yeah.
I'll wax the skis up.

502
00:30:45,407 --> 00:30:48,800
- OK.
- Yeah. Have fun. Don't fall in.

503
00:30:51,168 --> 00:30:53,568
- Bye.
- Bye.

504
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,842
OK, then.

505
00:31:29,604 --> 00:31:33,795
No.

506
00:31:39,172 --> 00:31:41,828
- Bon matin.
- Yeah, hi.

507
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:43,909
- We are here!
- What the fuck

508
00:31:43,941 --> 00:31:46,789
- We are... here!
- What do you think we're

509
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:49,477
- Seriously, what the fuck?!
- You said it was an emergency.

510
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:51,749
I didn't ask you to come
the fuck up here!

511
00:31:51,781 --> 00:31:55,333
Yes, you did, you did.
You said, "Stace, I need

512
00:31:55,365 --> 00:31:57,350
- We came.
- I didn't say that.

513
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:00,422
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't say that. But

514
00:32:00,454 --> 00:32:02,789
OK. Fuck, fuck, fuck.
OK, Doug, let's go, let's go.

515
00:32:02,822 --> 00:32:05,669
OK, yeah, yeah, I'll just get
my chauffeur hat.

516
00:32:05,702 --> 00:32:08,710
You know, I really...
Can I please pee? 'Cause

517
00:32:08,742 --> 00:32:10,630
I'd prefer it if you get
in the fucking Jeep and go.

518
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,743
Guess how many times
we stopped on the way here.

519
00:32:12,775 --> 00:32:14,823
- I don't give a shit!
- Five times.

520
00:32:14,855 --> 00:32:16,999
OK, you've got the bladder
of an 80-year-old man.

521
00:32:17,031 --> 00:32:20,615
Is that her?

522
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,792
She's a fuckin' babe.
- My God.

523
00:32:22,823 --> 00:32:25,352
That megalomaniac hasn't aged
a day.

524
00:32:25,384 --> 00:32:27,336
- Hi.
- Hi.

525
00:32:27,368 --> 00:32:29,384
: Hey, hey, hey.

526
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:31,400
Did you guys make some syrup?
- Yeah.

527
00:32:31,432 --> 00:32:36,616
How was the, uh, the sugar -
with the maples? The...

528
00:32:36,648 --> 00:32:40,554
- Hey.
- What are you guys doing here?

529
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:42,281
Oh, nothing.

530
00:32:42,313 --> 00:32:44,201
Yeah, they, uh...

531
00:32:44,233 --> 00:32:45,929
drove up here...

532
00:32:45,961 --> 00:32:49,737
And they're here,
at the lodge we're staying at.

533
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,657
Wait a second.

534
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,929
Stacey Humes?

535
00:32:53,962 --> 00:32:56,938
- Heeey!
- Wow,

536
00:32:56,971 --> 00:33:00,106
you look terrific.

537
00:33:00,139 --> 00:33:02,122
- Oh, thanks.
- Mwah.

538
00:33:02,155 --> 00:33:05,259
Exactly the same.
- Actually I just

539
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,915
- Oh, nice.
- Douglas Reginald.

540
00:33:07,947 --> 00:33:10,796
Your acquaintance.
- Ah, the man who made

541
00:33:10,827 --> 00:33:14,572
- Yeah.
- The reservation?

542
00:33:14,603 --> 00:33:17,356
Going on here.
What's going on here?

543
00:33:17,388 --> 00:33:21,933
Could you escort me to a john?
I need to do a bladder drainage

544
00:33:21,964 --> 00:33:25,293
Let me get my surgical gloves.
Follow me.

545
00:33:25,324 --> 00:33:28,396
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
This is just so ridiculous.

546
00:33:28,428 --> 00:33:31,917
They're insisting on tweaks
for the distributor meeting

547
00:33:31,949 --> 00:33:34,350
on Monday, and I've been
trying to reach you,

548
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:36,622
but I couldn't get you, so...
- The cell reception's terrible.

549
00:33:36,653 --> 00:33:41,102
And also we're on our getaway.
That's 'cause we wanted to get

550
00:33:41,134 --> 00:33:45,071
- Get away!
- What kind of tweaks?

551
00:33:45,102 --> 00:33:47,887
The dark prince's underbite.
He's like...

552
00:33:47,918 --> 00:33:50,063
- Yeah.
- They said, "He'd be able

553
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:52,175
to afford orthodontic work -
he's a prince," and I was said,

554
00:33:52,206 --> 00:33:55,727
"OK, why don't you eat
each other's assholes instead?"

555
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:57,967
- That's a good comeback.
- I wouldn't

556
00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:00,624
have bugged you if it weren't
for the promotion, right?

557
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:02,736
'Cause I know how much
that means to you.

558
00:34:02,767 --> 00:34:04,176
Yeah, it means a lot.

559
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,096
And you decided
to stay the night?

560
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,824
No! No, of course not.

561
00:34:07,855 --> 00:34:10,544
- That's fun, that's fun.
- No. No.

562
00:34:10,576 --> 00:34:13,328
We're gonna do the work,
Doug's gonna piss a few times,

563
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,601
and we're gonna leave.
- Good morning.

564
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:17,745
- Oh, great.
- I didn't know

565
00:34:17,777 --> 00:34:19,665
- you had friends coming up.
- Neither did we.

566
00:34:19,697 --> 00:34:21,681
Yeah. Stacey, je presente

567
00:34:21,713 --> 00:34:25,682
Lise et Anatalie.
- It's Anatolii.

568
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:27,281
I know who you are
and I love you.

569
00:34:27,314 --> 00:34:31,186
Are you guys still going
on that vineyard tour?

570
00:34:31,218 --> 00:34:34,610
On a ski route that links
all the wineries.

571
00:34:34,642 --> 00:34:36,723
Please come. It will be
so chill if we're all together.

572
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:38,802
Uh, no, no, no, they have
their own plans, dear.

573
00:34:38,835 --> 00:34:42,035
- We do.
- You know what? Plans recently

574
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:44,915
changed, so I'm in.

575
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:47,699
- Babe, you don't even drink.
- I can try

576
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:49,523
the local cheeses.

577
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:52,180
You're obsessed
with cheese.

578
00:34:55,795 --> 00:34:59,604
Hey, hey. I'm... I'm sorry.
I thought we were going

579
00:34:59,635 --> 00:35:02,036
Right. See, I don't give
a shit about rocks, though.

580
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:04,757
I am so sorry about all...
about this. It's crazy.

581
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:06,901
How could you forget to take
the dark prince's

582
00:35:06,932 --> 00:35:08,885
socioeconomic background
into consideration, Carl?

583
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:11,765
You don't take
my work seriously.

584
00:35:11,797 --> 00:35:14,198
You don't. You barely asked me
about my promotion. It was a...

585
00:35:14,229 --> 00:35:16,118
You said
you didn't get it yet.

586
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,006
Yeah, I know!

587
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:21,686
What do you want me
to do here? I'm...

588
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:26,167
Oh, I want you to go hang out
with your BFF who can't leave

589
00:35:26,198 --> 00:35:29,559
I'll be wine tasting
with your ex.

590
00:35:29,591 --> 00:35:31,863
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

591
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:38,007
Well, I guess we can put off
the work and tag along.

592
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:40,120
I mean, I heard there's
some really good cabernets...

593
00:35:40,152 --> 00:35:43,767
- What work, Stacey?!
- The... fake work.

594
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:46,968
Well, excuse me for trying
to make the most of the trip.

595
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,400
* Everywhere

596
00:35:53,432 --> 00:35:56,280
* That we go

597
00:35:56,313 --> 00:35:59,129
* Everywhere

598
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,266
* That we go

599
00:36:02,298 --> 00:36:05,530
* Seein' warm

600
00:36:05,561 --> 00:36:07,642
* People

601
00:36:07,673 --> 00:36:12,827
* Feel the positive pole

602
00:36:15,418 --> 00:36:17,114
* Yes oh yes, but so...

603
00:36:18,842 --> 00:36:20,731
Sue, give me your skis;
I'll lock 'em together.

604
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:23,803
Oh, yeah, thanks, Carl.
It's a rough neighborhood.

605
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:28,251
Hey, Sue, wait up.

606
00:36:31,964 --> 00:36:34,140
We'll start with whites.
We are

607
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:37,116
suspending Doug's diet in light
the situation. Thank you.

608
00:36:37,148 --> 00:36:39,292
The plan is to have dirty,
infected sex tonight,

609
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:41,436
right, my pet?
- There isn't anything

610
00:36:41,468 --> 00:36:45,405
not disgusting about that last
sentence. Please don't call

611
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:47,741
What's lodged
up your ass, man?

612
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:51,037
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe it's that my wife is

613
00:36:51,069 --> 00:36:54,302
with the love of my life.
- Do you get how messed up that

614
00:36:54,334 --> 00:36:57,725
the love of your life in
the same sentence as your wife?

615
00:36:57,758 --> 00:37:00,350
That's not
what I meant, Stace.

616
00:37:00,382 --> 00:37:02,558
Well, what did you mean?

617
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,703
I don't know, Doug!

618
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:10,687
OK, listen. I know, I know.
You're looking at Robyn,

619
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:13,055
you're remembering how she would
boss you around in a meeting,

620
00:37:13,086 --> 00:37:16,128
and then you'd be the one
in control when you'd be

621
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:18,048
of her car, OK?
- Respect.

622
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,543
How is that supposed
to help me?

623
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:21,952
She's just

624
00:37:21,984 --> 00:37:25,024
the one that got away, Carl.
Everyone has one.

625
00:37:25,056 --> 00:37:29,408
She's your white buffalo.
- Mine was an ex-con.

626
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,225
- What?
- Yeah. Louise.

627
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:33,953
- Louise.
- She was a mugger.

628
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:38,466
What I mean by that is she used
to... mug everybody.

629
00:37:38,497 --> 00:37:41,857
It was a real problem.
- And then she... she got away.

630
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:45,249
Besides, dude, Robyn is so
weird. She's buying her parents

631
00:37:45,282 --> 00:37:48,194
a ski lodge that she used
as a fuck den.

632
00:37:48,226 --> 00:37:51,042
OK, we did a little bit more
than just...

633
00:37:51,074 --> 00:37:53,539
Yeah, it's kinda weird. I didn't
think about that until just now.

634
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:56,290
Yeah, and I'm gonna
tell you something.

635
00:37:56,322 --> 00:37:59,170
I didn't like you
when you were with Robyn.

636
00:37:59,203 --> 00:38:03,267
Yeah, I said it. You were
suddenly above everything.

637
00:38:03,299 --> 00:38:05,188
'Cause I remember being happy.
- Oh, really?

638
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:07,779
Well, when you were happy,
everyone hated you, so...

639
00:38:07,811 --> 00:38:12,004
- Dude, you have a great wife.
- Yeah, I know I have a great

640
00:38:12,036 --> 00:38:14,404
who married her.
- So then what the fuck?

641
00:38:14,435 --> 00:38:16,644
So then nothing, OK?
Everything's gonna be fine.

642
00:38:16,677 --> 00:38:18,564
Everything's fine,
everything's great,

643
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:21,924
except for the fact that
you guys decided to show up.

644
00:38:21,957 --> 00:38:23,748
Kidding. Come on,
bring it in.

645
00:38:23,781 --> 00:38:25,860
I love you.
Shouldn't have come.

646
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:42,950
So, it's nice that, uh,

647
00:38:42,983 --> 00:38:45,318
you get to spend so much time
with Anatolii.

648
00:38:45,351 --> 00:38:47,942
We haven't seen each other
in months.

649
00:38:47,975 --> 00:38:50,439
I don't know if he stays
in France to avoid me,

650
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:53,160
or the women he's entered
in Montreal,

651
00:38:53,191 --> 00:38:55,335
many of whom are my peers.

652
00:38:55,368 --> 00:38:58,215
- Excuse me?
- One doesn't prepare

653
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:00,872
for dinner parties with friends
that have fucked your son.

654
00:39:02,857 --> 00:39:06,664
That's an interesting problem
to encounter.

655
00:39:06,697 --> 00:39:07,657
: Bonjour.

656
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:23,177
** Toi qui me quitte
avec la levée du jour *

657
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:27,018
* Et qui me laisse dans I'espoir
d'un retour *

658
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:30,795
* Pourquoi ne pas faire durer
ce matin *

659
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,419
* Jusqu' demain *

660
00:39:33,451 --> 00:39:36,618
* Je t'offrirai

661
00:39:36,651 --> 00:39:40,459
* Des croissants de soleil
pour déjeuner *

662
00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:44,172
* la saveur de miel
et de rosée *

663
00:39:44,203 --> 00:39:47,980
* Sur un plateau de drap
et d'oreiller *

664
00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:50,669
* Qui fait rver *

665
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:56,813
* Puis nous dînerons
de paroles de rve *

666
00:39:56,844 --> 00:40:00,557
* Nous goutterons I'amour
et I'eau fraîche *

667
00:40:00,589 --> 00:40:03,725
* Et puis quand viendra
le nouveau matin *

668
00:40:03,757 --> 00:40:06,701
* On sera si bien

669
00:40:06,733 --> 00:40:09,453
* J'inventerai

670
00:40:09,486 --> 00:40:13,518
* Des recettes de bonheur
volonté *

671
00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:17,710
* Sur une musique venue
d'un ciel de mai *

672
00:40:17,743 --> 00:40:21,102
* Que tu ne voudras
plus jamais quitter *

673
00:40:21,134 --> 00:40:24,174

674
00:40:24,206 --> 00:40:26,767

675
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:31,376
* La la la la la la

677

678
00:40:40,463 --> 00:40:42,160
Oh, my God!

679
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:46,960
Formidable!
Formi-fuckin'- dable!

680
00:40:52,977 --> 00:40:54,034
That was beautiful, babe.

681
00:40:54,065 --> 00:40:55,824
- Thanks.
- You're so talented.

682
00:40:55,857 --> 00:40:58,705
Thank you. OK.

683
00:40:58,737 --> 00:41:00,114
Come on, let's eat.

684
00:41:00,145 --> 00:41:04,273
Anatolii and I are gonna
smoke a pinner.

685
00:41:04,306 --> 00:41:07,026
- We're in the middle of a meal.
- Yeah, I'm not so hungry.

686
00:41:07,058 --> 00:41:08,114
Ate a lot of cheese.

687
00:41:08,146 --> 00:41:11,315
I'm kind of obsessed with it.
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

688
00:41:11,347 --> 00:41:16,083
Could you just leave him alone
for like two seconds?

689
00:41:16,116 --> 00:41:18,228
How much wine
have you had?

690
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:20,115
- Hardly any.
- Would you let go?

691
00:41:20,148 --> 00:41:21,939
You're pinching me.

692
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,052
What is wrong with you?!

693
00:41:41,845 --> 00:41:42,772
Mine tastes like

694
00:41:42,805 --> 00:41:46,997
Dr. Crapperstein
compared to this.

695
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:49,782
Where is everybody?

696
00:41:50,102 --> 00:41:52,118
Well, Stacey and Doug went
to pee.

697
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:54,550
He's a highly hydrated
individual.

698
00:41:54,582 --> 00:41:57,462
And, um, the rest left.

699
00:41:57,495 --> 00:42:00,375
How nice of them.

700
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:05,814
You wanna walk?

701
00:42:05,847 --> 00:42:08,119
Mm-hmm.

702
00:42:08,152 --> 00:42:11,416
So, I used to have
this fantasy/nightmare

703
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:14,935
about the guy you end up with.
- Hm.

704
00:42:14,968 --> 00:42:17,239
Yeah. So, you're
in a limo,

705
00:42:17,272 --> 00:42:21,752
and you're, uh, you're
on the way to, um,

706
00:42:21,785 --> 00:42:23,897
the premiere of a game
he designed.

707
00:42:23,928 --> 00:42:27,833
Oh, here we go.

708
00:42:27,864 --> 00:42:30,073
And, uh, and I...

709
00:42:30,105 --> 00:42:32,313
pop into your head,

710
00:42:32,345 --> 00:42:36,217
just like this...
momentary thought.

711
00:42:37,946 --> 00:42:41,018
And then you look
at the guy, the new guy...

712
00:42:42,746 --> 00:42:45,338
...and you think
to yourself, "Wow...

713
00:42:46,874 --> 00:42:51,355
...this guy inspires me
so much more."

714
00:42:54,075 --> 00:42:57,595
And then
you guys just fuck.

715
00:42:57,627 --> 00:42:59,867
Does he have a bigger dick
than you?

716
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,684
- Oh, yeah. Balls too.
- Oh, my God.

717
00:43:02,716 --> 00:43:06,363
You love
to torture yourself.

718
00:43:06,395 --> 00:43:07,772
- Fuck you.
- OK.

719
00:43:07,804 --> 00:43:09,660
Fuck me.

720
00:43:11,805 --> 00:43:16,221
You remember when we did it
in the floor of your office

721
00:43:17,949 --> 00:43:19,677
With the door open.

722
00:43:21,756 --> 00:43:24,701
Do you remember when you used
to whisper in my ear...

723
00:43:26,782 --> 00:43:28,830
That I wanted
to go down on my knees

724
00:43:28,861 --> 00:43:31,487
so the entire staff would know
I was yours?

725
00:43:33,918 --> 00:43:36,638
The world was our canvas,
and we used

726
00:43:36,671 --> 00:43:40,574
every color imaginable
to paint it.

727
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,120
Well, if you ever quit
game design, you could

728
00:43:45,151 --> 00:43:47,583
get into the greeting card
business.

729
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:53,439
He became obsessed
with the animals he painted.

730
00:43:53,472 --> 00:43:55,904
- These are terrifying.
- Yeah, that's his intention.

731
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:58,720
Fear of that
which infatuates us.

732
00:43:58,752 --> 00:44:00,928
Apparently
he married this owl.

733
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,225
- What the fuck?
- For tax reasons, I'm assuming.

734
00:44:04,257 --> 00:44:06,145
Yeah!

735
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:07,808
I just found my new tattoo.

736
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,049
: He has your eyes.

737
00:44:31,458 --> 00:44:33,347
I'd be lying if I said that

738
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,523
I haven't fantasized
about being back here.

739
00:44:37,251 --> 00:44:41,155
Was the helmet part of it?

740
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:47,492
Can I ask you
something?

741
00:44:49,476 --> 00:44:53,252
Why do you like me
so much?

742
00:44:54,981 --> 00:44:57,093
Like you?

743
00:45:05,157 --> 00:45:06,694
I'm only good

744
00:45:06,726 --> 00:45:08,614
in the beginning,

745
00:45:08,646 --> 00:45:12,262
the exciting part.
I can't do the rest.

746
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:16,070
I think you're addicted to men
falling in love with you.

747
00:45:16,103 --> 00:45:18,566
Don't reduce me to that
because it didn't work

748
00:45:18,598 --> 00:45:20,774
Work out?

749
00:45:20,806 --> 00:45:24,295
How could it have possibly
worked out? You left!

750
00:45:24,327 --> 00:45:27,367
You never flew to Vancouver
to tell me.

751
00:45:27,399 --> 00:45:29,544
You never fought for me.

752
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:33,928
But why here?

753
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:36,744
Why did you buy
this fucking place?

754
00:45:38,601 --> 00:45:41,129
Because there is a part
of me that was hoping

755
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,977
this was more
a than memory too.

756
00:45:44,009 --> 00:45:48,073
I loved you, Carl,
no matter what you think.

757
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:19,147
That guy's going
really fast.

758
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:20,172
Hey, slow down!

759
00:46:20,203 --> 00:46:22,827
Slow down!

760
00:46:24,939 --> 00:46:27,148
Oh, fuck, what? Come on!
Are you kidding me?

761
00:46:27,181 --> 00:46:28,812
Oh, my God!

762
00:46:34,765 --> 00:46:36,716
What are you doing here?

763
00:46:36,749 --> 00:46:39,405
Currently I'm
trying to keep warm.

764
00:46:39,437 --> 00:46:42,093
- Wait, you know this guy?
- Who are you?

765
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:44,141
- He's nobody.
- Oh, thanks a lot. Yeah.

766
00:46:44,174 --> 00:46:47,343
Would you mind telling me what
the hell is going on right now?

767
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:51,630
Please, I'd love to hear it.
I'm as curious as shit-face

768
00:46:51,662 --> 00:46:54,702
- Carl, this is Aaron...
- OK.

769
00:46:54,734 --> 00:46:57,871
...my, um...
husband.

770
00:46:59,887 --> 00:47:04,367
You're... you're married?
To this guy?

771
00:47:04,399 --> 00:47:07,888
- Separated.
- Yeah, thanks for

772
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,544
- How did you know I was here?
- Your parents told me.

773
00:47:10,576 --> 00:47:12,528
Oh, and want to pass
this message along. They think

774
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,312
you're wonderful and amazing and
have never done anything wrong

775
00:47:15,344 --> 00:47:17,201
This is the guy
from your office?

776
00:47:17,233 --> 00:47:21,329
You're Aaron Berg, aren't you?
I recognize you. You're

777
00:47:21,361 --> 00:47:23,504
Oh, and you must be
Sherlock Holmes, is that right?

778
00:47:23,537 --> 00:47:26,033
I'll take Watson, thank you.
She's got a better body.

779
00:47:26,065 --> 00:47:28,401
OK, Carl, can you
take the skidoo back?

780
00:47:28,433 --> 00:47:30,705
And Aaron and I, we'll walk.
- Yeah, could you get the fuck

781
00:47:30,738 --> 00:47:33,522
out of here, ski patrol?
- Hey, you know what?

782
00:47:33,554 --> 00:47:35,698
You destroyed the skis!
You destroyed my skis, pal!

783
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:38,802
Yeah, they're fucked!
- I can see that!

784
00:47:49,907 --> 00:47:51,379
What are you doing

785
00:47:51,411 --> 00:47:53,203
in the middle of the woods
with this piece of dog shit?

786
00:47:53,235 --> 00:47:55,347
He's a friend, trust me.
He's married.

787
00:47:55,379 --> 00:48:00,147
You can't do this. You can't fly
here and expect anything.

788
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:03,059
I just want to talk.
- So talk.

789
00:48:03,092 --> 00:48:07,605
I love you, and I want you to
come home so that we can

790
00:48:07,636 --> 00:48:11,253
It was never my home.
I was always a visitor there.

791
00:48:11,285 --> 00:48:14,037
Don't say that, OK?
I hate when you say that shit!

792
00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:17,460
- Don't get "angy."
- I'm not... I'm not

793
00:48:17,493 --> 00:48:21,046
I'm just saying, you're buying
a fucking ski lodge in Quebec.

794
00:48:21,077 --> 00:48:24,726
A psychotic
episode or something?

795
00:48:24,757 --> 00:48:27,542
- Oh, it wasn't that bad.
- Oh, oh, really?

796
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:31,350
Ejaculating all over my desk?
I'd call that pretty bad.

797
00:48:31,382 --> 00:48:34,391
That seemed like the right
thing to do at the time.

798
00:48:34,422 --> 00:48:35,959
Oscar misses you.

799
00:48:35,991 --> 00:48:38,039
- Right.
- He does. It's like a wake

800
00:48:38,071 --> 00:48:40,983
at our house. We can't
watch any of our shows.

801
00:48:41,015 --> 00:48:44,631
I have all
the Rookie Blu PVR'd.

802
00:48:44,664 --> 00:48:45,464
Watch 'em.

803
00:48:45,495 --> 00:48:48,568
I'm caught up.
Crazy stuff happens.

804
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,480
- What?
- Hey, I can't get

805
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:54,520
this fucking thing started.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

806
00:48:54,552 --> 00:48:57,625
I'm really sorry.
- Why the fuck

807
00:48:57,656 --> 00:49:01,113
are you still here, huh?!
- Hey, you know what, pal?

808
00:49:01,144 --> 00:49:03,993
I think she's making
her feelings pretty clear, OK?

809
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:07,898
Oh, is that right?
Excuse me, just one second.

810
00:49:07,929 --> 00:49:11,066
- Fake head butt?
- Stop!

811
00:49:11,097 --> 00:49:13,850
What are you gonna do,
motherfucking bitch?

812
00:49:13,882 --> 00:49:17,082
- Mr. Slap My Face?
- OK, OK, OK, Carl,

813
00:49:17,115 --> 00:49:20,187
Yeah, go.

814
00:49:22,618 --> 00:49:24,763
Oh, that's right,
I can't get it started.

815
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,354
Love to get out of here. I'd
love to get out of your hair.

816
00:49:27,387 --> 00:49:31,099
I'd love it.

817
00:49:31,131 --> 00:49:33,787
Get it started.
A little turn of the key.

818
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:35,836
It's really nice to meet you,
man. That was sarcasm.

819
00:49:35,867 --> 00:49:38,620
Yeah, nice to meet you.
Ride this back to the lodge,

820
00:49:38,652 --> 00:49:40,316
you fuckin'...

821
00:49:57,405 --> 00:50:00,510
I can't believe she's married
to Aaron Berg.

822
00:50:02,238 --> 00:50:05,086
You should have seen the guy;
he was a fuckin' maniac.

823
00:50:20,864 --> 00:50:24,992
Hey, I'm really sorry
about this, about all this -

824
00:50:25,023 --> 00:50:27,008
Stacey, and everything...

825
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:29,121
I'm sorry I was...

826
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:32,256
jealous of Anatolii.
He seems like a perfectly

827
00:50:32,289 --> 00:50:36,000
nice, very handsome young man.

828
00:50:46,145 --> 00:50:47,777
Babe.

829
00:50:50,977 --> 00:50:55,043
There's something I want
to tell you about Robyn and I.

830
00:50:57,955 --> 00:51:00,067
What?

831
00:51:00,899 --> 00:51:03,779
Our relationship was
a little more intense

832
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,627
than I originally led on.

833
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,540
We actually dated
for like a year.

834
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,620
Hm.

835
00:51:18,788 --> 00:51:20,644
Yeah, but it was...

836
00:51:20,676 --> 00:51:23,973
everything that's wrong
in a relationship.

837
00:51:24,004 --> 00:51:27,172
It was toxic, passionate...

838
00:51:27,205 --> 00:51:29,606
- Sounds awful.
- The whole thing

839
00:51:29,637 --> 00:51:31,781
consisted of just fighting
and fucking...

840
00:51:31,813 --> 00:51:34,598
- Stop!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

841
00:51:37,797 --> 00:51:40,774
I just thought I owed you

842
00:51:40,805 --> 00:51:42,438
the truth.

843
00:51:44,998 --> 00:51:47,110
Are you OK?

844
00:51:48,935 --> 00:51:51,047
I think so.

845
00:51:56,967 --> 00:52:00,647
It's so odd that you've
never mentioned this person.

846
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:04,200
I love you
so much.

847
00:52:04,232 --> 00:52:07,752
I want to be buried
next to you.

848
00:52:07,783 --> 00:52:12,424
And you can wear your... your
disgusting sweater for eternity.

849
00:52:16,713 --> 00:52:18,985
I've got a surprise
for you.

850
00:52:19,016 --> 00:52:22,473
I have something for you.
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.

851
00:52:24,714 --> 00:52:27,753
If you guys went out
for a year...

852
00:52:27,786 --> 00:52:29,450
Yeah.

853
00:52:31,722 --> 00:52:36,043
Well... it's kind of amazing
that she happened

854
00:52:36,074 --> 00:52:38,059
to buy the lodge
that you brought me to.

855
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:42,442
- No, no, I had no idea...
- It's just a big coincidence.

856
00:52:42,475 --> 00:52:45,548
Depends on how
you look at it.

857
00:52:48,395 --> 00:52:51,563
Have you been here with her?

858
00:52:51,596 --> 00:52:54,220
I thought you would think
it was weird, so I didn't...

859
00:52:54,252 --> 00:52:57,036
- You have?
- Now, hold on, I haven't...

860
00:52:57,069 --> 00:53:01,293
It is weird, Carl.
It's extremely fucking weird.

861
00:53:01,324 --> 00:53:02,957
Clearly you knew that
or you wouldn't have

862
00:53:02,988 --> 00:53:04,396
kept it a secret.
- Yeah, I did keep it

863
00:53:04,428 --> 00:53:06,316
a secret because I knew that
you would think it was weird.

864
00:53:06,348 --> 00:53:09,997
I just said that.
Oh, OK, uh, Greece is romantic.

865
00:53:10,029 --> 00:53:12,685
If I'd taken her to Greece,
does that mean we could

866
00:53:12,718 --> 00:53:14,605
Probably not;
that's just how it works.

867
00:53:14,638 --> 00:53:17,869
And this isn't a fucking
country, Carl; it's a ski lodge.

868
00:53:17,902 --> 00:53:19,597
How many times
have you been up here?

869
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:22,991
- Does that matter?
- More than once?

870
00:53:23,022 --> 00:53:25,871
- I don't know, a few times.
- Did you stay

871
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:28,398
in this room? Did you stay
in the fucking Lovers' Suite?

872
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:32,496
It's a small inn. We probably
stayed in all the rooms.

873
00:53:32,527 --> 00:53:34,895
You probably fought and fucked
all over this place.

874
00:53:34,927 --> 00:53:36,943
I feel sick to my stomach.
I feel sick.

875
00:53:36,975 --> 00:53:39,408
No, listen, I picked
this place because I knew

876
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,360
it was nice, and I thought
you would like it.

877
00:53:41,391 --> 00:53:44,559
That's it, that's the whole...
Where are you going?

878
00:53:44,592 --> 00:53:46,864
It's freezing outside!

879
00:53:51,985 --> 00:53:53,329
Hey.

880
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,280
What are you doing?

881
00:53:55,312 --> 00:53:57,489
I'm not allowed to bring
my iPad, but you can fucking...

882
00:53:57,521 --> 00:53:59,570
I'm so fucking sick
of your rules, Carl.

883
00:53:59,601 --> 00:54:01,713
What are you doing?

884
00:54:05,202 --> 00:54:07,314
It's her, isn't it?

885
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:15,891
It looks like you.
I designed her to look like you.

886
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:18,514
I don't have a fucking
rose tattoo on my forearm.

887
00:54:20,051 --> 00:54:22,611
You're obsessed with her.
- No, I'm not obsessed with her.

888
00:54:22,643 --> 00:54:25,332
What happened on that
ski trail? What happened?

889
00:54:25,363 --> 00:54:27,252
You were completely flushed
when you came in.

890
00:54:27,283 --> 00:54:28,979
Yeah, he slapped me
in the face!

891
00:54:29,011 --> 00:54:32,596
Well, why the fuck would he
slap you if you hadn't

892
00:54:40,532 --> 00:54:43,765
The clothes you get me to wear.
The heels. You've been trying

893
00:54:43,796 --> 00:54:45,685
to mold me into
your ex-girlfriend for years!

894
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:48,020
- That's insane!
- No shit! I have changed

895
00:54:48,053 --> 00:54:50,294
so much for you.
- I've changed everything!

896
00:54:50,325 --> 00:54:52,021
I've changed tons of things
for you.

897
00:54:52,053 --> 00:54:55,413
- I quit drinking for you.
- No, you quit drinking for you.

898
00:54:55,446 --> 00:54:57,462
You were drunk every
fucking night! You were dr...

899
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:59,863
I was a kid! Sorry I wasn't
inspiring the world

900
00:54:59,894 --> 00:55:02,935
with a fucking ski lodge!
- I don't want that.

901
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,206
You don't know
what the fuck you want.

902
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:07,063
I just want you.
Please, please.

903
00:55:07,094 --> 00:55:10,327
- Give me the keys.
- Please, please! I'm not gonna

904
00:55:10,358 --> 00:55:12,471
- Give me your keys, Carl!
- Please...

905
00:55:14,839 --> 00:55:16,376
Stop it!

906
00:55:16,407 --> 00:55:19,575
Sue, where are you gonna go?
Where are you gonna go?

907
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:22,487
Door... slam!

908
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,000
Oh, my God!

909
00:55:28,728 --> 00:55:30,840
Sue, Sue, are you OK?

910
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:39,258
Honey.

911
00:55:51,066 --> 00:55:54,779
You know, it's pretty
incredible that you've held

912
00:55:54,811 --> 00:55:57,019
Look, hey, maybe
there's something to be said

913
00:55:57,050 --> 00:56:00,539
about that, you know?
On the other hand,

914
00:56:00,571 --> 00:56:02,651
you could have, like,
an obsessive disorder,

915
00:56:02,683 --> 00:56:07,867
in which case we should...
we should talk to a physician.

916
00:56:07,899 --> 00:56:08,827
You want me to be quiet?

917
00:56:08,859 --> 00:56:10,843
Yeah.

918
00:56:10,876 --> 00:56:13,180
OK.

919
00:56:17,661 --> 00:56:21,308
- Sue, are you all right, baby?
- Get the fuck out of here,

920
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:24,413
Get the fuck away from me.
Get out!

921
00:56:26,908 --> 00:56:29,246
I want to take
her to the hospital.

922
00:56:29,278 --> 00:56:32,477
50km away, so I would
advise against it.

923
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:34,781
Oh, oh, you would?
You'd advise against it?

924
00:56:34,814 --> 00:56:36,862
He'd advise against it.
- How is she?

925
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:39,581
Well, we think
she's had a concussion.

926
00:56:39,614 --> 00:56:41,950
Shit. Well,
how do you know?

927
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:44,991
He's some kind of life coach.

928
00:56:45,022 --> 00:56:48,575
- You're a life coach?
- I'm a trained lifeguard.

929
00:56:48,607 --> 00:56:49,791
Like in real life?

930
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,767
This isn't some erotica film?
- Hey, man, I passed bronze med.

931
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,391
- Oh, that's no joke.
- Well, she asked that you don't

932
00:56:55,423 --> 00:56:58,303
sleep in her room tonight,
asshole - her words.

933
00:56:58,336 --> 00:57:01,440
She'll see you
tomorrow, asshole.

934
00:57:01,471 --> 00:57:04,832
Is that second "asshole"
from you, or her?

935
00:57:04,865 --> 00:57:07,904
Listen, you gotta wake her up
intermittently throughout the

936
00:57:07,937 --> 00:57:09,824
you slap her in the face,
you punch her in the teeth.

937
00:57:09,857 --> 00:57:10,880
- Seriously, man?
- She has a concussion.

938
00:57:10,913 --> 00:57:13,184
So you punch my wife
in the teeth?

939
00:57:17,217 --> 00:57:19,713
Basically he's saying his mom
is gonna sleep with Sue,

940
00:57:19,745 --> 00:57:23,010
and it hasn't happened yet,
but that is going to happen,

941
00:57:23,042 --> 00:57:25,410
and that... I'm getting
that Anatolii...

942
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:28,162
I'm just getting that Anatolii
is not happy about that.

943
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:36,323
Trouble in paradise?

944
00:57:38,723 --> 00:57:41,123
Look, Carl, I'm...

945
00:57:41,156 --> 00:57:43,427
sorry about your skis.

946
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,924
And also for slapping you
in the face.

947
00:57:49,316 --> 00:57:51,204
The skis were
a limited edition.

948
00:57:51,236 --> 00:57:53,411
Find them on the internet.
- Probably not.

949
00:57:53,444 --> 00:57:55,557
It'll be challenging.

950
00:57:57,892 --> 00:57:59,685
- Have a beer with me.
- Honestly, I just

951
00:57:59,717 --> 00:58:03,269
want to get some sleep.
- I will have a beer.

952
00:58:03,301 --> 00:58:05,509
Me too.
My day buzz is wearing off.

953
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:08,038
Oh-ho-ho, quick, inject
the female with some alcohol

954
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:11,429
before she turns into
a fucking monster.

955
00:58:11,461 --> 00:58:15,878
There you go, you got
some drinking buddies.

956
00:58:17,413 --> 00:58:19,718
Well, I wouldn't want
to make you "angy."

957
00:58:25,479 --> 00:58:27,719
What's your,
uh, tattoo?

958
00:58:27,751 --> 00:58:29,447
That is a panther,

959
00:58:29,479 --> 00:58:33,032
those are lightning bolts
shooting out of its eyes;

960
00:58:33,063 --> 00:58:36,583
therefore
it's a lightning panther.

961
00:58:36,615 --> 00:58:37,735
- I love it.
- It's impossible

962
00:58:37,768 --> 00:58:39,655
not to.

963
00:58:39,688 --> 00:58:42,152
So,

964
00:58:42,184 --> 00:58:44,360
you're the Carl
that went out with my wife.

965
00:58:44,392 --> 00:58:49,096
Hm. And you're the husband
we never knew existed.

966
00:58:49,129 --> 00:58:51,433
She didn't mention me?

967
00:58:52,585 --> 00:58:56,201
- I probably wasn't listening.
- Yeah, I tend to tune her out

968
00:58:56,234 --> 00:58:58,025
myself.
- Mm-hmm.

969
00:58:58,058 --> 00:58:59,753
- Well, most do.
- You know,

970
00:58:59,785 --> 00:59:03,914
frankly, I just... expected
someone a little...

971
00:59:03,946 --> 00:59:06,314
Yeah, well,
the feeling's mutual.

972
00:59:06,346 --> 00:59:08,490
I guess we know
she has a type.

973
00:59:08,523 --> 00:59:10,986
- I'm too hot for her.
- You know, it's crazy.

974
00:59:11,019 --> 00:59:15,307
You're the guy whose career
I wish I had.

975
00:59:15,339 --> 00:59:16,555
Yeah, well, I had a kid
really young,

976
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:18,539
so it made me grow up fast.
- Oh, how old is

977
00:59:18,571 --> 00:59:21,323
your little twerp?
- He's not a twerp anymore.

978
00:59:21,355 --> 00:59:22,603
He's got pubic hair.

979
00:59:24,556 --> 00:59:26,443
Oscar is 13, so...

980
00:59:26,476 --> 00:59:28,171
- Ah, 13.
- Yeah.

981
00:59:28,204 --> 00:59:32,395
- Were you 13 when you had him?
- Ha, ha. No.

982
00:59:32,428 --> 00:59:34,477
Holly and I were seniors
in high school.

983
00:59:34,508 --> 00:59:36,685
Holly's my first wife.

984
00:59:36,716 --> 00:59:39,629
Wow. Well, maybe
third time will be the charm.

985
00:59:39,661 --> 00:59:40,973
Stacey.

986
00:59:41,004 --> 00:59:44,077
No, um, this is
gonna work out.

987
00:59:44,109 --> 00:59:46,446
I mean, it...
it has to.

988
00:59:46,477 --> 00:59:50,894
Robyn is, uh...
everything to me, so...

989
00:59:50,926 --> 00:59:55,406
Honestly, I respect that.
I do. I mean, you chased

990
00:59:55,437 --> 00:59:57,679
- Yeah.
- And it didn't work out.

991
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:00,302
I mean, sometimes I wish
I had done the same.

992
01:00:02,638 --> 01:00:05,487
What do...
what do you mean by that?

993
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:07,726
Oh, come on, Doug.
When I was a little girl,

994
01:00:07,759 --> 01:00:11,247
I didn't exactly dream of being
with a man with a supernatural

995
01:00:11,279 --> 01:00:13,808
and a yeast infection.
- Serious?

996
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,623
It's very serious.

997
01:00:16,656 --> 01:00:19,984
To you and not settling.

998
01:00:34,002 --> 01:00:37,009
- My body, my rules!
- Oh! I'm sorry.

999
01:00:48,018 --> 01:00:50,419
Sue?

1000
01:00:55,507 --> 01:00:56,851
Oh, um...

1001
01:00:56,882 --> 01:00:59,028
Oh, my God.

1002
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,852
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

1003
01:01:00,884 --> 01:01:02,355
I'm sorry, I...

1004
01:01:02,388 --> 01:01:04,500
This room is not part
of the B&B experience.

1005
01:01:04,531 --> 01:01:07,028
I am still renovating.
- I'm sorry, I'm gone.

1006
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:09,108
I'm so sorry.
- No, wait, wait. It's fine,

1007
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:13,525
it's fine. This pigeon pose -
everything just comes

1008
01:01:13,557 --> 01:01:15,669
gushing out, you know?

1009
01:01:17,461 --> 01:01:20,501
I'm so mortified.

1010
01:01:20,533 --> 01:01:23,381
There. Better?

1011
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,910
Yeah.

1012
01:01:25,942 --> 01:01:28,662
Nice tights. Heh. Not.

1013
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:34,325
Remember when Borat brought
the "not" back?

1014
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:37,206
Comedy works in cycles.

1015
01:01:37,238 --> 01:01:38,806
Yeah, yeah.

1016
01:01:38,838 --> 01:01:40,727
No, that's very funny.

1017
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:45,016
You knew you were emailing
with me,

1018
01:01:45,047 --> 01:01:46,327
right? I haven't changed
my work email

1019
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:48,184
in 10 years.

1020
01:01:51,448 --> 01:01:53,335
A little strange

1021
01:01:53,368 --> 01:01:55,736
you didn't mention it.

1022
01:01:55,768 --> 01:01:58,808
A little strange
you brought your wife here.

1023
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,281
It's a mistake to over-
intellectualize paintings.

1024
01:02:08,313 --> 01:02:11,130
Picasso said it's
like the sound of birds -

1025
01:02:11,161 --> 01:02:14,137
it fills you with emotion,
yet you can't make sense of it.

1026
01:02:14,169 --> 01:02:17,593
- Mm, that's cool.
- Mm.

1027
01:02:17,626 --> 01:02:19,674
: Morning.

1028
01:02:24,314 --> 01:02:26,010
What about you, Sue?

1029
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:28,795
Did you get much rest
with my mother molesting you?

1030
01:02:55,836 --> 01:02:58,493
Hey.

1031
01:02:58,524 --> 01:03:01,854
- Am I interrupting something?
- Yes.

1032
01:03:01,885 --> 01:03:03,997
Tough. Shared table.

1033
01:03:05,726 --> 01:03:08,221
Are you OK?
Is your head all right?

1034
01:03:08,254 --> 01:03:11,134
It's never been
more clear.

1035
01:03:15,806 --> 01:03:18,782
Do you ever take those
heels off? It's 9am.

1036
01:03:18,815 --> 01:03:22,495
My nana sent them from Italy.
Good morning, everyone.

1037
01:03:22,526 --> 01:03:24,767
'Tis a beautiful one.
- 'Tis, Ryan,

1038
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:29,055
'tis. You know
what I think it is?

1039
01:03:29,088 --> 01:03:31,167
It's all this history.

1040
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,928
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

1041
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,136
- Hey.
- I got morning hugs.

1042
01:03:35,168 --> 01:03:36,992
Come on.
- No.

1043
01:03:37,024 --> 01:03:40,672
- Don't touch me.
- Whoa, you can't catch

1044
01:03:40,705 --> 01:03:42,913
Ooh, ahh!
What's on the grill?

1045
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:46,946
- Oh, fuck.
- Aaron, uh,

1046
01:03:46,977 --> 01:03:50,337
- You're pretty.
- And this is Lise and Anatolii.

1047
01:03:50,369 --> 01:03:53,282
- Mmm.
- As you may have gathered, I do

1048
01:03:53,313 --> 01:03:56,162
that is, when she
makes it home for dinner.

1049
01:03:56,193 --> 01:03:58,978
If you look up "mortified"
in the dictionary, you'll

1050
01:03:59,009 --> 01:04:02,307
That's cute. The only place
she can bear to lose control

1051
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:05,602
what I'm talking about, right?
- Are you kidding me?

1052
01:04:05,634 --> 01:04:08,483
Can you help me
in the kitchen?

1053
01:04:08,514 --> 01:04:10,818
Jeez. My turn on the chore wheel
again, I guess.

1054
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:14,403
Do you know what it's like
to have walked through your

1055
01:04:14,435 --> 01:04:16,996
look of disappointment on their
faces that I'm not Holly?

1056
01:04:17,027 --> 01:04:19,204
Who gives a shit what they
think? They're fucking senile!

1057
01:04:19,235 --> 01:04:21,540
Who cares if Oscar doesn't
like you? This is about us.

1058
01:04:21,572 --> 01:04:23,620
- He said that?
- No.

1059
01:04:23,652 --> 01:04:25,541
He's a teenager -
he hates everything.

1060
01:04:25,572 --> 01:04:28,421
Don't take is personally.
- I'm a horrible stepmother.

1061
01:04:28,452 --> 01:04:31,333
- No, you're not.
- Just come home.

1062
01:04:31,364 --> 01:04:34,117
Look, I know
that this has been hard, pickle.

1063
01:04:34,149 --> 01:04:37,157
How did you get out of your jar
and all the way here?

1064
01:04:38,886 --> 01:04:41,381
I took a pickle plane.

1065
01:04:41,413 --> 01:04:44,614
The seating was cramped.

1066
01:04:44,646 --> 01:04:46,598
Hot beans?

1067
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:49,447
- Coffee?
- I will take half a cup.

1068
01:04:49,478 --> 01:04:51,878
Great. No problem.
Anybody else?

1069
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:55,303
- Thank you.
- Do you want

1070
01:05:01,702 --> 01:05:03,815
- What's sailor?
- Shh.

1071
01:05:23,017 --> 01:05:25,321
They went
snowshoeing.

1072
01:05:25,353 --> 01:05:28,425
Who's "they?"

1073
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:30,953
Your wife and the cougar.

1074
01:05:35,273 --> 01:05:36,970
I feel you, man.

1075
01:05:37,002 --> 01:05:39,402
I have a flight to Paris
in six hours.

1076
01:05:39,434 --> 01:05:41,387
I've done an amazing thing
coming here.

1077
01:05:41,418 --> 01:05:44,075
Yeah, yeah,

1078
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:47,275
you're such a great son,
you see your mom twice a year

1079
01:05:47,306 --> 01:05:49,418
Well, she's the one
getting action now.

1080
01:06:14,413 --> 01:06:15,373
Sue?

1081
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:18,766
Sue?

1082
01:06:39,215 --> 01:06:41,391
What's going on?

1083
01:06:41,423 --> 01:06:42,672
We were snowshoeing.

1084
01:06:44,752 --> 01:06:46,639
No, you weren't.
The snowshoes are behind you,

1085
01:06:46,672 --> 01:06:49,328
stuck in the fucking snow.
- I'll wait by the trail.

1086
01:06:50,863 --> 01:06:53,393
There's no need to wait.
You can just leave.

1087
01:06:53,424 --> 01:06:55,536
You don't deserve her.

1088
01:07:05,009 --> 01:07:07,665
We shared a moment.

1089
01:07:07,698 --> 01:07:09,906
You know what that's like.

1090
01:07:11,666 --> 01:07:14,386
So, now you're...
cheating on me

1091
01:07:14,418 --> 01:07:17,618
with a woman
that you just met.

1092
01:07:22,354 --> 01:07:25,939
Don't you think that you're
overreacting a little bit?

1093
01:07:25,971 --> 01:07:30,803
Uh... I look at it as
making up for lost

1094
01:07:30,836 --> 01:07:34,547
What the fuck
does that mean?

1095
01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:38,228
When you get sad, is it
because you're thinking of her?

1096
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:42,196
No.

1097
01:07:42,228 --> 01:07:43,636
You know, for months
you've been

1098
01:07:43,668 --> 01:07:46,868
implying that this weekend was
gonna be some big answer

1099
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:49,557
and I think I was in denial
about what needed fixing.

1100
01:07:49,588 --> 01:07:53,909
- We don't need fixing.
- Stop lying for two seconds!

1101
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:01,398
I haven't been attracted
to you for two years.

1102
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:04,278
So, that's my thing.

1103
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:06,422
You gross me out.

1104
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,263
I do?

1105
01:08:18,551 --> 01:08:20,919
I'm glad
this weekend happened.

1106
01:08:20,952 --> 01:08:24,759
I think it had to happen.
So you can go fuck yourself,

1107
01:08:24,792 --> 01:08:26,488
sailor.

1108
01:08:49,946 --> 01:08:52,314
Ah.

1109
01:08:52,346 --> 01:08:53,722
Hey, Sherlock.

1110
01:08:53,753 --> 01:08:57,083
I see you've solved the mystery
of starting the skidoo.

1111
01:08:57,114 --> 01:09:00,155
- I did.
- I'm sorry I called you sailor.

1112
01:09:00,186 --> 01:09:02,523
No, it's all right.

1113
01:09:02,554 --> 01:09:04,666
It wasn't your fault.

1114
01:09:07,675 --> 01:09:09,564
Want to get on?

1115
01:09:09,595 --> 01:09:12,028
I was looking forward
to the arm workout.

1116
01:09:14,235 --> 01:09:16,348
Get on the skidoo, Robyn.

1117
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,351
Mmm.

1118
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,696
Right here.
This is good.

1119
01:10:05,728 --> 01:10:08,992
- Oh... wait, wait, wait.
- No, no, no, I'm falling.

1120
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,152
- OK, right here.
- What are...

1121
01:10:14,881 --> 01:10:17,025
- Oh. Oh, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1122
01:10:17,057 --> 01:10:19,200
Can you... are you, uh...
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1123
01:10:19,233 --> 01:10:21,921
- Do you want my... I can...
- They make it really hard to

1124
01:10:21,953 --> 01:10:23,521
OK, I'm not on the pill,
so pull out, OK?

1125
01:10:23,554 --> 01:10:25,410
Yeah, yeah, of course.

1126
01:10:31,714 --> 01:10:33,410
Holy shit.

1127
01:10:33,442 --> 01:10:35,650
Fuck.

1128
01:10:35,682 --> 01:10:38,083
Oh, yeah.

1129
01:10:38,114 --> 01:10:39,650
Oh!

1130
01:10:39,682 --> 01:10:42,530
Oh! Oh!

1131
01:10:42,563 --> 01:10:45,155
Yeah. Ah!

1132
01:10:48,323 --> 01:10:50,211
- Ah.
- Yeah.

1133
01:10:50,243 --> 01:10:51,939
- Shit. I'm sorry.
- Oh.

1134
01:10:51,972 --> 01:10:54,692
I'm sorry. Let me just...
I can go... here.

1135
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:58,468
Did you... did you?
- No.

1136
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,836
No, you go ahead.
Are you close?

1137
01:11:02,564 --> 01:11:05,125
Not really, no.

1138
01:11:05,157 --> 01:11:08,164
Um... uh...

1139
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:10,533
OK.

1140
01:11:10,565 --> 01:11:12,901
Just, uh...
can you

1141
01:11:12,933 --> 01:11:16,294
tell me how you were waiting
for me on the trail

1142
01:11:16,326 --> 01:11:18,053
like a little slu...

1143
01:11:18,086 --> 01:11:20,997
like, uh,
in your snowsuit?

1144
01:11:22,726 --> 01:11:25,254
Uh, yeah. Um...

1145
01:11:25,287 --> 01:11:27,654
I was getting, uh,
maple syrup

1146
01:11:27,686 --> 01:11:30,183
at the tree,
and, uh...

1147
01:11:30,215 --> 01:11:33,063
and I was waiting for the sap...
- Yeah.

1148
01:11:33,095 --> 01:11:36,135
...'cause it takes a while.
- Yeah, sap will take

1149
01:11:36,167 --> 01:11:39,496
And, um...

1150
01:11:39,528 --> 01:11:41,896
Shit.
- Robyn, are you crying?

1151
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:43,975
Oh, my God.

1152
01:11:44,008 --> 01:11:45,959
Oh, shit, no.

1153
01:12:04,169 --> 01:12:06,729
I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

1154
01:12:06,762 --> 01:12:09,482
I think so. You?

1155
01:12:13,482 --> 01:12:15,370
We should get going.

1156
01:12:15,402 --> 01:12:16,939
You go ahead.

1157
01:12:16,971 --> 01:12:19,210
No, I'm not gonna leave
without you.

1158
01:12:19,243 --> 01:12:21,548
No, please go.

1159
01:12:50,734 --> 01:12:55,021
She's gone - with the hottie
and his hot mother.

1160
01:12:55,053 --> 01:12:57,166
See you in the city.

1161
01:13:09,007 --> 01:13:10,895
Well, I'm on the 8 o'clock
home tonight.

1162
01:13:10,927 --> 01:13:13,295
Yeah, I think she might have
completely lost her mind.

1163
01:13:13,327 --> 01:13:16,272
Yeah. Can I call you back?

1164
01:13:20,144 --> 01:13:26,992
* I'll follow

1165
01:13:39,698 --> 01:13:42,770
* I'm yours, so...

1166
01:13:56,019 --> 01:13:58,771
Oh, of course
that's what's happening.

1167
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:14,388
Hey.

1168
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:16,308
Sue.

1169
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:18,260
Go home, Carl.

1170
01:15:03,897 --> 01:15:05,560
What the hell
are you doing here, Carl?

1171
01:15:05,591 --> 01:15:08,793
You broke into my house?
Are you kidding me?!

1172
01:15:08,825 --> 01:15:11,577
Now Anatolii's joined
the party.

1173
01:15:14,073 --> 01:15:16,921
All right, all right, buddy,
just... just cool your jets, OK?

1174
01:15:16,953 --> 01:15:19,194
- Please, guys...
- OK, all right, I'm...

1175
01:15:19,225 --> 01:15:21,337
He knows Krav Maga.

1176
01:15:23,514 --> 01:15:26,042
- Hey!
- Oh! Fuck! Stop it!

1177
01:15:26,074 --> 01:15:29,018
Stop it! Stop. Enough.

1178
01:15:34,074 --> 01:15:37,563
We need to speak.
- Your husband's a pussy.

1179
01:15:37,595 --> 01:15:39,483
What are you even doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be

1180
01:15:39,515 --> 01:15:43,067
on some movie set in Paris
getting your... getting

1181
01:16:20,446 --> 01:16:23,294
And then they get
the fuck out of this house.

1182
01:16:23,326 --> 01:16:25,342
Copy that.

1183
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:35,936
Sorry to interrupt
your dance party.

1184
01:16:42,304 --> 01:16:43,424
I think the best

1185
01:16:43,456 --> 01:16:47,105
discovery I made this weekend
was how much I miss wine.

1186
01:16:50,433 --> 01:16:52,705
I love you so much.

1187
01:16:54,817 --> 01:16:56,737
Not enough.

1188
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:01,281
We don't
love each other enough.

1189
01:17:03,714 --> 01:17:05,665
I disagree.

1190
01:17:09,026 --> 01:17:11,138
How do you know?

1191
01:17:16,995 --> 01:17:19,107
I slept with her.

1192
01:17:30,532 --> 01:17:33,765
I was... confused.

1193
01:17:33,796 --> 01:17:36,388
You said
that it was over.

1194
01:17:50,086 --> 01:17:52,998
I was gonna give you this
over the weekend.

1195
01:17:54,726 --> 01:17:56,838
I finally got
our wedding rings.

1196
01:18:04,999 --> 01:18:06,631
Sue.

1197
01:18:08,615 --> 01:18:10,407
Wait.

1198
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,336
How could you look
into my father's eyes

1199
01:18:15,368 --> 01:18:18,567
and ask to marry me if you had
all this shit in your heart?

1200
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,416
How could you make me
walk down the aisle?

1201
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:24,712
How can you do that
to somebody?

1202
01:18:24,745 --> 01:18:26,632
What was I supposed to do?
Just bow out of life

1203
01:18:26,665 --> 01:18:29,192
because I have
a little baggage?

1204
01:18:30,889 --> 01:18:34,442
Everyone's got exes, Sue;
everyone's got little pieces

1205
01:18:34,473 --> 01:18:37,545
of their heart that belong
to other people.

1206
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:41,994
It just becomes a part
of who you are.

1207
01:18:47,562 --> 01:18:49,674
But you let it ruin us.

1208
01:19:26,605 --> 01:19:28,653
** What is this

1209
01:19:30,414 --> 01:19:34,735
* Got me feelin' so good
right now *

1210
01:19:34,766 --> 01:19:38,415
* What is this

1211
01:19:38,446 --> 01:19:42,255
* Make me wanna run home
anyhow *

1212
01:19:42,287 --> 01:19:46,256
* Whatever it is, yeah

1213
01:19:46,287 --> 01:19:50,447
* Oh, I cannot, cannot hold

1214
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,367
* My peace

1215
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,559
* Mmm *

1216
01:20:10,162 --> 01:20:12,689
- Hi.
- Mmm.

1217
01:20:12,721 --> 01:20:15,058
All dressed up
for the opera?

1218
01:20:21,714 --> 01:20:24,978
How's it been going...
generally?

1219
01:20:29,363 --> 01:20:32,082
Be sure
you chew that, now.

1220
01:20:35,283 --> 01:20:37,940
Is there anything in there
he can cut himself with?

1221
01:21:11,414 --> 01:21:14,423
Later, dick nipples.

1222
01:21:14,454 --> 01:21:16,854
That's nipples on dicks.

1223
01:21:16,887 --> 01:21:21,175
That makes absolutely
no sense.

1224
01:21:21,207 --> 01:21:22,039
I'll call you later.

1225
01:21:22,072 --> 01:21:25,144
OK. I'll be sure
to screen the call.

1226
01:21:52,409 --> 01:21:54,105
It's Sue, right? Hmm?

1227
01:21:54,138 --> 01:21:56,409
It's good to see you back

1228
01:21:56,442 --> 01:21:58,489
on stage, Carlos Santana.

1229
01:22:00,026 --> 01:22:02,810
You're in town
for the Mexican parade?

1230
01:22:05,307 --> 01:22:08,251
Is there a...
Mexican parade in town?

1231
01:22:08,283 --> 01:22:10,171
- I don't know.
- No?

1232
01:22:10,203 --> 01:22:12,123
You look amazing.
- Oh.

1233
01:22:12,155 --> 01:22:15,003
I agree.
I do look fantastic.

1234
01:22:18,107 --> 01:22:20,507
So, I've had some time
to do some thinking.

1235
01:22:20,539 --> 01:22:22,108
Uh, yeah, I've been doing

1236
01:22:22,139 --> 01:22:25,788
a lot of thinking. Um...
- Before you say anything,

1237
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:30,140
I just want to...
put something out there.

1238
01:22:30,172 --> 01:22:32,285
I'm seeing somebody.

1239
01:22:37,981 --> 01:22:40,253
That...
Oh, that's cool.

1240
01:22:42,173 --> 01:22:43,837
Who is he?

1241
01:22:45,566 --> 01:22:47,678
He's just a guy.

1242
01:22:49,822 --> 01:22:52,958
We shouldn't have done this.
- No, we had to do it.

1243
01:22:54,878 --> 01:22:56,414
We had to.

1244
01:22:57,950 --> 01:23:01,503
If it didn't hurt, something
would be wrong with me.

1245
01:23:01,535 --> 01:23:03,647
There's a lot
wrong with you.

1246
01:23:07,968 --> 01:23:09,920
The fact is, I...

1247
01:23:09,951 --> 01:23:12,000
I lost...

1248
01:23:12,032 --> 01:23:16,160
someone that I could have spent
the rest of my life with.

1249
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:18,656
It wouldn't have been
right, though.

1250
01:23:20,385 --> 01:23:22,912
I acted more like a sister
than a wife.

1251
01:23:22,945 --> 01:23:24,769
You were perfect.

1252
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,521
No. No, no. No.

1253
01:23:27,553 --> 01:23:31,233
I knew that it was over
long before that weekend.

1254
01:23:31,265 --> 01:23:34,530
And I was just too scared
to do anything about it.

1255
01:23:46,275 --> 01:23:48,163
I miss you.

1256
01:23:51,076 --> 01:23:54,979
Just promise me you won't make
your next girlfriend wear

1257
01:23:59,267 --> 01:24:01,027
I don't...

1258
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:03,428
think I can do that.

1259
01:24:06,084 --> 01:24:09,125
- Mmm.
- You're doing great, baby.

1260
01:24:11,748 --> 01:24:14,341
You gross me out.

1261
01:24:14,373 --> 01:24:17,798
Fuck you.

1262
01:24:17,829 --> 01:24:20,037
** I don't want nobody
to leave me *

1263
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:22,790
* I don't need nobody
to want me *

1264
01:24:22,821 --> 01:24:26,886
* I know this may sound strange
right from the start *

1265
01:24:26,918 --> 01:24:29,575
* 'Cause when I wanted somebody
to need me *

1266
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:32,230
* When I needed somebody
to want me *

1267
01:24:32,263 --> 01:24:36,199
* All I ever got was
a broken heart *

1268
01:24:36,231 --> 01:24:38,888
* I felt no taller
than the ground *

1269
01:24:38,919 --> 01:24:41,383
* True love had
let me down *

1270
01:24:41,415 --> 01:24:45,128
* But I had to be a man
and stand up tall *

1271
01:24:45,159 --> 01:24:47,848
* And this heart of mine
was pure *

1272
01:24:47,879 --> 01:24:49,928
* But I know
now for sure *

1273
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,848
* That love,
you didn't love me *

1274
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,728
* You didn't need me,
you didn't want me *

1275
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,649
* Don't want nobody
to change me *

1276
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:59,400
* Or try
to rearrange me *

1277
01:24:59,433 --> 01:25:03,369
* Just take away the pain
that's tearing up my mind *

1278
01:25:03,401 --> 01:25:06,249
* 'Cause love has been
my total destruction *

1279
01:25:06,281 --> 01:25:08,170
* Like a volcano
eruption *

1280
01:25:08,201 --> 01:25:12,010
* To me, love and pain
just seem to rhyme *

1281
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:15,178
* I felt no taller
than the ground *

1282
01:25:15,209 --> 01:25:17,642
* True love had
let me down *

1283
01:25:17,674 --> 01:25:21,611
* I had to be a man
and stand up tall *

1284
01:25:21,642 --> 01:25:24,139
* This heart of mine
was pure *

1285
01:25:24,171 --> 01:25:26,282
* But I know
now for sure *

1286
01:25:26,315 --> 01:25:28,331
* That love,
you didn't love me *

1287
01:25:28,363 --> 01:25:30,987
* You didn't need me,
you didn't want me *

1288
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:33,132
* I don't want nobody
to change me *

1289
01:25:33,163 --> 01:25:35,371
* Or try
to rearrange me *

1290
01:25:35,403 --> 01:25:39,564
* Take away the pain
that's tearing up my mind *

1291
01:25:39,596 --> 01:25:42,123
* Love has been
my total destruction *

1292
01:25:42,156 --> 01:25:44,012
* Like a volcano
eruption *

1293
01:25:44,043 --> 01:25:48,364
* To me, love and pain
just seem to rhyme *

1294
01:25:48,397 --> 01:25:52,845
* Love don't love me

1295
01:25:52,877 --> 01:25:57,485
* No, no, no, no

1296
01:25:57,517 --> 01:26:01,454
* Love don't love me

1297
01:26:01,486 --> 01:26:05,550
* Love, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no... **
