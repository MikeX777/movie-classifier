1
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:54,141
My grandmother was
always clear about one thing,

2
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:55,838
at the end of our days

3
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:57,796
the truly meaningful
parts of our lives

4
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:01,235
have absolutely nothing
to do with luck.

5
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,505
Life is about being aware of
the promises made to US by god.

6
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:12,159
Understanding that
god never promised

7
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:15,205
a life without
pain and heartache.

8
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:22,038
He never promised that the
storms wouldn't be many

9
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,387
and that those many storms

10
00:01:23,474 --> 00:01:26,216
wouldn't be the
harshest of harsh.

11
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:34,746
The promises we do have
is the strength to fight

12
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,792
through the pain
and the heartache.

13
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,057
And an internal force to
withstand even the worst storms.

14
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:46,715
Once we have this clarity

15
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:49,239
we know that the weather
of our situations

16
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:51,981
is not determined
by simple luck.

17
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:54,984
That the weather itself
is not even a value.

18
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:25,710
It's our reaction
to life's weather

19
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:28,017
as we face it with
the strong arm of god

20
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:31,499
that will ultimately
determine our destiny.

21
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:05,228
Ash?

22
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:09,145
Ashley.

23
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:14,150
- please don't
miss the bus again.

24
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:18,763
I'm not
gonna miss the bus.

25
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,156
How many
times have I told you

26
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:23,333
to keep this pigsty picked up.

27
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,641
You know, most of
my friends have a housekeeper.

28
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:29,078
- We do too, me.

29
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:30,427
- You don't count.

30
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:33,213
Real housekeepers
don't complain.

31
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:37,173
Rude.

32
00:03:38,653 --> 00:03:42,222
Keep your
things picked up.

33
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:43,962
But I still love you.

34
00:03:46,443 --> 00:03:48,315
Love you.

35
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:50,621
Don't miss the bus.

36
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:02,764
- That thing has broke
every day this week.

37
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:06,246
And I fixed
it every day this week.

38
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,116
- What?

39
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:13,514
- You said it broke
every day this week

40
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:15,429
and I fixed it
every day this week.

41
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:17,169
So it could be worse for ya.

42
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,911
- Yeah, if it's at all possible
to make things worse for me

43
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:23,654
I'm sure we'll figure it
out and make it happen!

44
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:25,482
Good morning.

45
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:28,790
Hey!

46
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:41,237
Where's mama going?

47
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,727
- Away from me baby
girl, away from me.

48
00:04:57,993 --> 00:04:59,386
Have a good day.

49
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,259
- It's okay mama.

50
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,732
- Knock knock.

51
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:42,603
- Hey.

52
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,431
You busy?

53
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:45,780
Of course you are.

54
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:47,651
- Come on in, what's up?

55
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:51,263
- I have a few folks
you may want to see.

56
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,484
- What happened?

57
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:56,660
- Nothing really.

58
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:58,401
Nothing?

59
00:05:58,488 --> 00:06:01,578
- It seems Bobby denton had a
few not so nice things to say

60
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:05,147
about Lila and Nate thought
he would ask him about it.

61
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:06,931
- Bobby denton is
a big fat jerk.

62
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:07,889
Lila!

63
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:09,586
- Sorry.

64
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:12,502
- No matter what Bobby denton
says I think Nathaniel knows

65
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:14,548
that he's not supposed
to be fighting.

66
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:17,289
- He asked him to say sorry.

67
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,813
But he didn't.

68
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,424
- Vicky, would you please
take Lila back to class?

69
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:23,339
Sure thing.

70
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:25,123
- Can I say one more thing?

71
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,473
- Make it quick.

72
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,910
- Bobby denton
has two ice packs.

73
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,262
- Let me get her back to class.

74
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:34,524
- Have a seat.

75
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:40,487
Are you okay?

76
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:43,359
- I'm fine it doesn't even hurt.

77
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:45,535
- Look, I know you were just--

78
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:49,191
- I know, I know I
shouldn't have hit him.

79
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:51,759
- As much as it seems like
fighting can fix the situation

80
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:54,805
I can promise you it doesn't.

81
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:56,677
- There's never
times where it's okay

82
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:58,592
to fight for something?

83
00:07:02,596 --> 00:07:04,946
- What did he say
to your sister?

84
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:09,429
- He called her ugly, stupid
and she looked like a fish.

85
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:10,952
What did Lila do?

86
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,563
- Well, she told him
he smelt like a fish.

87
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,436
He needed to be
punched in the face.

88
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:17,741
- You're a good big brother

89
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:19,351
to take up for
your little sister

90
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,006
but promise me next time
you'll do everything you can

91
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:23,965
not to hit someone.

92
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:26,141
There are other ways to fight.

93
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:27,011
- Okay.

94
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:32,060
Promise me.

95
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:33,148
- I promise.

96
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:39,415
- All right, get back to class.

97
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,055
I know that's
not army man Antwan greer.

98
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:54,925
- Oh-wah.

99
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,450
What's up brother?

100
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,930
How you doing?

101
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:02,454
- Good man, being all I can be.

102
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,327
I can see that,
it's good to see you man.

103
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:06,502
- It's good being seen.

104
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:08,199
- So when'd you get home?

105
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:10,419
I didn't think you were due
back until after Christmas.

106
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:12,073
- Coming in on a
bus this morning.

107
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,205
Had the opportunity to come
home early so I took it.

108
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:16,599
- I'm glad you did.
- Yeah me too.

109
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:18,253
I bet your mom
and sister were freaked out

110
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,124
when you walked in
through the door?

111
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:22,387
- Yeah, I think my
mom's still crying.

112
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:23,345
- Yeah, I bet.

113
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:28,176
Had to ask the
whole town how to find you.

114
00:09:28,263 --> 00:09:29,394
- Here I am.
- Yeah.

115
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:31,832
- A few birdies told
me you've been spending

116
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,573
your evenings out here working.

117
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,922
Didn't believe them.

118
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,664
I had to see it for myself.

119
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:39,361
John Archer working.

120
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:41,189
- Yeah I stay busy.

121
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:43,321
I mean we can't all be soldiers.

122
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:45,889
- Yeah, some of US are too busy

123
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:48,631
making priceless works of art.

124
00:09:48,718 --> 00:09:50,851
- Yeah I wish.
- Come on.

125
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:52,592
We both know you're a genius.

126
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,681
Stop being modest.

127
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:57,901
- You know I do have an
art show opening next week.

128
00:09:57,988 --> 00:10:00,643
Yeah it's my first
one, I'm excited.

129
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,646
- You should be.
- Yeah it'll be good.

130
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:04,778
- It looks like she
ain't even been used

131
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:06,083
since I've been gone.

132
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,607
- Yeah.

133
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:09,434
Well she's about the
only thing of value

134
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:10,827
I have in this world

135
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:13,830
so gotta keep her
that way you know.

136
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:17,660
- You know the whole time
on the bus this morning,

137
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:19,706
I just kept thinking about

138
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:23,448
what I was gonna do back
on my first night in aiken.

139
00:10:23,535 --> 00:10:24,754
First night a free man.

140
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:25,973
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

141
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,237
So what
are we gonna do?

142
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:31,413
- I don't know about you,

143
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,501
but I'm gonna get
me some dinner,

144
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:34,198
get a little bit of shut eye.

145
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:35,547
I'm tired, bro.

146
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:39,900
- We ain't kids anymore, twan.

147
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:43,817
Heck I get tired
just shoveling dirt.

148
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:48,865
Can't imagine what a day
of war would do to me.

149
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,911
- Yeah well you
speak for yourself.

150
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:52,652
I'm still a kid.

151
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:55,437
Tomorrow I act like one.

152
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:57,700
Go celebrate me back
in town in style.

153
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:58,788
- Okay.

154
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:01,530
- So you with me?

155
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:04,359
- Do I really have
to answer that?

156
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:06,448
- Okay then.
- Okay.

157
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:09,016
- So tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

158
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:13,324
Is the little lady
still coming over this evening?

159
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:15,413
As far as I know.

160
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,893
I thought maybe we could
take her over to the pond

161
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,330
and let her feed
the ducks tomorrow.

162
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,289
Oh she'd like that.

163
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:23,683
If there were
any ducks there to feed.

164
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,423
Seems like they're less
and less every time

165
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,860
we come over here.

166
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:31,647
Anytime it seems
there's less of a good thing,

167
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:35,085
we're probably just not
looking hard enough.

168
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,479
What's wrong?

169
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:39,699
Nothing.

170
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:41,570
Should we
go back to the car?

171
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:45,705
No, let's just
sit down for a minute.

172
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:08,423
- How bad is it?

173
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,729
- It's already better.

174
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:12,253
It leaves as
quickly as it comes.

175
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:18,955
I guess when it comes to
aging, I'm not like fine wine.

176
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:21,828
- Is there anything I can do?

177
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:24,178
- No, no, I'm fine, really.

178
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:31,141
- Well if you're
fine, then I'm fine.

179
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:35,972
Are you brushing
your teeth, young lady?

180
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,800
- Yes.
- You better be.

181
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,412
Five more minutes.

182
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,502
- At least your fictional
time is less than

183
00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:46,374
the last one you gave them.

184
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:47,244
- Funny.

185
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:54,774
- Hey do you remember
Sharon dirks?

186
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:55,644
- Should I?

187
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:58,952
- I think you met
her at the food

188
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:01,868
shelter function last summer.

189
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:03,478
She's a redhead.

190
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:06,742
I think
so, what about her?

191
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,004
- It's her and her
husband I keep having

192
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:10,790
to show the place on diller to.

193
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:15,751
- What?

194
00:13:19,276 --> 00:13:22,236
No, I know that look.

195
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:25,500
That's the I have
something to tell you look.

196
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:26,370
Spill it.

197
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:32,463
- I was just gonna tell you
how amazing you look tonight.

198
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,685
- I don't buy that
but I'll take it.

199
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:45,346
- I didn't hear you knock.

200
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:46,826
- Under the mat.

201
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:52,266
- Lila, your uncle John's here.

202
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,747
Why aren't you at mom's?

203
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,185
She ran out of chips.

204
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:04,713
- Uncle John!
- Hey, there she is.

205
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,107
I swear you get bigger
every time I see you.

206
00:14:07,194 --> 00:14:09,109
That's how
it works, right?

207
00:14:09,196 --> 00:14:10,284
- I guess so.

208
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:13,504
So em...

209
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:15,419
What are you all
dolled up for anyway?

210
00:14:15,506 --> 00:14:17,117
- She has a daddy date.

211
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:18,858
Something like that.

212
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:22,905
- Well whatever the
reason, you clean up well.

213
00:14:25,386 --> 00:14:28,824
- Is that a compliment?
- Back handed.

214
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,870
But a compliment nonetheless.

215
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:33,133
That's
what I was thinking.

216
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,264
- Are you ready?

217
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:35,831
We still have to drop Lila off.

218
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:36,876
- Can uncle John take me?

219
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,878
- Can uncle John take you where?

220
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:40,488
I'm staying
with grandma.

221
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:43,273
- I'm sure uncle
John's too busy.

222
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,103
- You know I do have
more chips to eat.

223
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,889
But I guess I could
give her a lift.

224
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:52,587
- I don't think--
- John that'd be great.

225
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:54,067
We're running late already.

226
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:55,895
Yeah it's no problem.

227
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:58,941
- Have you had a
single drop to drink?

228
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:01,944
- I'm not answering that.

229
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:03,815
- Straight from here to there?

230
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,034
- That either.
- John.

231
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:07,558
- Okay, no alcohol, no stops.

232
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:10,039
Got it.

233
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:15,958
- Love you.
- John thanks.

234
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:17,829
- Yeah, no problem.

235
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,527
- Please be careful.

236
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:21,007
- Rachel, let's go.

237
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,706
- Have fun you two.

238
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,492
So where are your
brother and sister?

239
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:30,886
- Nate's at Harrison's
and ash is anywhere

240
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,628
away from this house.

241
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:35,935
- She seems to spend a
lot of time there huh?

242
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,066
Yep.

243
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:41,897
- I've got an idea.
- Okay.

244
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,681
- What do you say
we stop for a cone

245
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:44,900
on the way to grandma's.

246
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,728
- I say yes.
- Done.

247
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,211
I gotta take this.

248
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:55,041
Tell you what, grab that,
order whatever you want

249
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:56,216
and tell them to make two.

250
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:57,478
- Okay.
- Okay?

251
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:04,093
- Ron, what's up, man?

252
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,487
Yeah what are you thinking?

253
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:39,781
- You know I can't
remember the last time

254
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:42,610
we took a walk for
the soul enjoyment

255
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:44,307
of each other's company.

256
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,093
- We can maybe
start doing it again

257
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,616
if I can get you to get
home before nine o'clock

258
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:49,443
in the evening.

259
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:52,794
- Fair enough.

260
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:56,058
Of course you know after
we start with the walks,

261
00:16:56,145 --> 00:16:58,234
then after that you're
going to have to start

262
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:01,629
taking me dancing
every once in a while.

263
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:03,544
- Dancing?
- Yes dancing.

264
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:06,112
You know I love to go dancing.

265
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:10,942
What are you doing?

266
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:15,338
- Dancing.
- Here?

267
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:16,948
- Right here.

268
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,950
- There's no music.

269
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,517
- Who cares?

270
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:23,520
- You're right.

271
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:25,522
Let's dance.

272
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:43,062
Thank you.

273
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:45,194
- For what?

274
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,154
- For nothing.

275
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:51,026
For everything.

276
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:01,863
- I thought we'd at
least get through dinner.

277
00:18:05,214 --> 00:18:05,954
Answer it.

278
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:08,130
- Not tonight.

279
00:18:09,218 --> 00:18:10,785
- Rachel, it's fine.

280
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:15,572
- Let me see who it is.

281
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:22,927
Hello?

282
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:29,456
Yeah, they're
trying to get her stable now

283
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,240
and that's what we're doing.

284
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:34,025
Trying to get her stable
before they move her on out.

285
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,332
Okay 'cause I have
another test to do.

286
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:37,942
- I was getting ready to
close and then all of a sudden

287
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:40,380
the door burst wide open
and this guy walks in,

288
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:42,860
and he comes at me with
a gun and he demands

289
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:45,689
all the money and
then there's a kid.

290
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:47,169
Take your
time, it's alright.

291
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:49,171
There's a shot.

292
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:00,965
Where is she?

293
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:02,793
Where is she?

294
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,707
Where is she?

295
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:05,187
Tell me she's okay.

296
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,407
- Lila?
- Okay.

297
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:09,931
They're working
on her right way.

298
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:11,672
- That's not my baby!

299
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,108
Oh no!

300
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:15,066
That's not her.

301
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:25,033
Oh god, what did you do?

302
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,601
What did you do to my baby?

303
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:23,613
Rach.

304
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,491
What am I gonna do?

305
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:34,711
- What are they saying?

306
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:38,062
- They told US nothing.

307
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:42,371
It's gonna be alright.

308
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:19,729
Nathaniel
and ash, do they know?

309
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,605
- Do you wanna tell them?

310
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:29,565
- Where is she?

311
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:33,961
- Inside.

312
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:40,054
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

313
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,856
I'm sorry.

314
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,967
- I know you're sorry, John boy.

315
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:28,363
You've always been sorry

316
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,803
and you've always been
a sorry selfish person.

317
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:38,547
You spent your whole life

318
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:40,419
worrying about John,

319
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:44,423
worrying about all
the little things

320
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,164
you thought would
make you happy.

321
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:56,043
And everybody always just
looked the other way.

322
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,741
Let you do what
you wanted to do.

323
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:06,793
There were never any
repercussions until now.

324
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,410
Your selfishness has
ripped my world to shreds.

325
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,456
- I am sorry.

326
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:18,979
- Stop saying that.

327
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,112
The only thing you should
be doing is getting

328
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:26,987
on your knees and begging
god to bring my baby back.

329
00:24:27,074 --> 00:24:32,601
- God, you honestly
want me to pray to god?

330
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:35,865
- That's exactly what
I want you to do.

331
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:40,348
- Forget it, okay, if god
cared at all about me,

332
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:42,263
if he cared about any of US,

333
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,439
none of this would
have happened.

334
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:48,487
Don't
you dare say that.

335
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:50,401
God didn't have anything
to do with this.

336
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,578
This wasn't his fault.

337
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:53,796
It's your fault.

338
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:55,972
No one else's.

339
00:24:58,018 --> 00:24:59,585
He didn't do this.

340
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:02,892
You did!

341
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:06,505
- Keep lying to yourself.

342
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:12,075
- Let me make one
thing perfectly clear.

343
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:16,645
I never want to see you again.

344
00:25:18,342 --> 00:25:19,692
Do you understand?

345
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,741
This will not be forgiven.

346
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:30,964
I don't ever wanna
see you again.

347
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:32,313
- You don't mean that.

348
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,836
Oh I do.

349
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:37,884
I couldn't mean it more.

350
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:42,541
- I know she's not my daughter

351
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:46,457
but I cannot imagine loving
anyone more than I loved her.

352
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,590
You have to know that.

353
00:25:48,677 --> 00:25:52,594
- The only thing that I
know is that I hate you.

354
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,211
- Not anymore than
I hate myself.

355
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,347
- You sent her in
there by herself.

356
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:09,002
Why?

357
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,270
- I had a phone call.

358
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:32,895
- My baby is dead because
you had a phone call.

359
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:36,638
Please.

360
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,557
Never ever forget that.

361
00:26:45,952 --> 00:26:47,867
Get out.

362
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,959
Get out!

363
00:27:14,937 --> 00:27:18,245
Would you
get the next round?

364
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:20,334
- Hey, could I get another?

365
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,293
- You don't think you've
had another, friend?

366
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,643
- Pour the drink.

367
00:27:25,774 --> 00:27:26,862
- You got it.

368
00:27:30,126 --> 00:27:31,867
- Alright, this one's
going in the corner.

369
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:32,999
- Yeah right.

370
00:27:40,136 --> 00:27:42,269
Sean's tab, could I
do a Jack and coke?

371
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:43,705
- Sure.
- Thanks.

372
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,452
Thank you.

373
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:56,283
- Where do you think
you're going so fast?

374
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,676
Excuse me?

375
00:27:57,763 --> 00:27:58,677
- You wanna come home
with me tonight or what?

376
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:00,026
Get off of me.

377
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:00,940
- What do you
think you're doing?

378
00:28:01,027 --> 00:28:02,463
Did you wanna die tonight?

379
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,508
You need to
get out of here, kid.

380
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:06,772
- And you need to listen to him.

381
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:08,774
- Hey I'll go, I'll go,

382
00:28:08,861 --> 00:28:12,212
but I believe I
ordered one last drink.

383
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:15,650
- You know what, I'll
get his last drink.

384
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,521
- Thank you, nice guy.

385
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:25,878
You think that hurts me?

386
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:28,881
- No, but it's
pretty funny though.

387
00:28:28,968 --> 00:28:31,100
- Oh yeah, that's real funny.

388
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:33,624
Hey just leave,
kid, before you do get hurt.

389
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,017
- Leave?

390
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:39,848
I haven't even paid my tab yet.

391
00:28:39,935 --> 00:28:42,808
- Consider it on the house.

392
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:46,507
- What, do I look like
I need a hand out?

393
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:47,900
- Come on, man.

394
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:51,207
- Hey, how about we, move.

395
00:28:52,252 --> 00:28:53,775
How about we barter?

396
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:59,520
Okay you give me liquor and...

397
00:29:01,435 --> 00:29:04,090
I'll help you
clean the place up.

398
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:26,460
- Hello.
- Good morning, doc.

399
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:29,158
Carolyn,
how are you doing?

400
00:29:29,245 --> 00:29:32,771
Well I've
been better of course.

401
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:37,863
- As much as I don't
want to say this,

402
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,866
I don't want to
drag it out either.

403
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:43,825
With everything inside of
me I wanted to come in here

404
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:46,480
and give you better news today.

405
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,572
- Has it gotten worse
or just not any better?

406
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:54,749
- The chemo had no effect.

407
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:57,752
Not only that, it's
spreading much faster

408
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:59,885
than we expected.

409
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:03,671
- What exactly does that mean?

410
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:07,936
- It means we do
not have much hope

411
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:10,765
for a positive
turn at this point.

412
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:18,817
- How long do I have?

413
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:22,908
Please just tell US how long.

414
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:26,955
- A few days, the
very most a few weeks.

415
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:33,048
- Um, can you go ask somebody
for a glass of water?

416
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:34,093
- Certainly.

417
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:48,150
- Even with this,
we can continue to
administer the chemo.

418
00:30:48,237 --> 00:30:49,891
- Well you just said it's
not gonna turn around.

419
00:30:49,978 --> 00:30:52,851
- Doctors are
wrong all the time.

420
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:55,897
But I will say,

421
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,423
we're hoping for a miracle here.

422
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:08,170
- No.

423
00:31:08,257 --> 00:31:09,432
No more chemo.

424
00:31:11,347 --> 00:31:12,827
What's gonna happen
is gonna happen

425
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:17,876
and I don't wanna be any
sicker than I have to be.

426
00:31:17,963 --> 00:31:21,053
Besides god creates miracles,

427
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,925
chemotherapy certainly does not.

428
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:26,710
Thank you.

429
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:34,893
- Okay.

430
00:31:36,764 --> 00:31:39,288
I'll give you two a few moments.

431
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,644
- Tell me what I can do?

432
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:51,910
If I could make it
go away I would.

433
00:31:57,219 --> 00:31:58,960
- I need them here.

434
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:01,397
Please James get my family here.

435
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:02,964
I don't care what you
have to tell them.

436
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:06,054
I need them here with US.

437
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:10,102
- I promise you,
they will be here.

438
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:28,990
- Hello?

439
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:31,166
Hey papa.

440
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,778
I'm good, how are you?

441
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,566
It's papa.

442
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:41,568
I'm not here.

443
00:32:41,655 --> 00:32:43,962
- Actually she just walked in.

444
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:46,181
Here she is.

445
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:48,575
I love you, bye.

446
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:51,273
- Thanks.

447
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,016
- Hi daddy.

448
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:59,847
Daddy I would but
I'm super busy today.

449
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:02,981
What?

450
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,505
What's wrong?

451
00:33:24,393 --> 00:33:25,351
- Who is it?

452
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,792
What time is it?

453
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:35,361
Open the door.

454
00:33:44,761 --> 00:33:46,111
Go ahead.

455
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:50,115
- Well you don't look good.

456
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:58,775
So you got a lot of
painting done last night?

457
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:00,299
- Why are you here?

458
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,432
- Why am I here?

459
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,523
I've been asking that myself
more and more everyday.

460
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:12,485
John what's your problem?

461
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:16,054
- Being woken up this
early is one of them.

462
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:21,363
- What did you do last night?

463
00:34:26,151 --> 00:34:26,934
John.

464
00:34:28,588 --> 00:34:29,980
John your phone.

465
00:34:39,207 --> 00:34:39,990
Hello?

466
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,995
Hi, sir, how are you?

467
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah, one second.

468
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,437
Hey, it's for you.

469
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,004
Tell them
I'll call them back.

470
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,181
- It's your grandfather.

471
00:34:56,268 --> 00:35:00,141
Tell my grandfather
I'll call him back.

472
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:01,229
- You tell him.

473
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:09,237
- Hey grandpa.

474
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:15,635
What?

475
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:23,860
Okay, how is she?

476
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,299
Yeah.

477
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:29,997
Of course, course, I can come.

478
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:32,826
Alright.

479
00:35:34,915 --> 00:35:36,090
Okay I love you.

480
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:43,141
Hey, is
everything okay?

481
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:46,144
- I don't know.

482
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:52,498
- What's wrong?

483
00:35:54,543 --> 00:35:58,112
- My grandma, she's sick.

484
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,289
What kind of sick?

485
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:04,162
- Like cancer sick.

486
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:07,121
- I'm sorry.

487
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,644
- It's fine.

488
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:10,646
- What are you gonna do?

489
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:13,040
- I don't know.

490
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:16,217
Toss some stuff in a bag.

491
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:19,089
Go to aiken.

492
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,135
- How are you gonna get there?

493
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:23,093
- I'll figure it out.

494
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,227
- Do you want me
to come with you?

495
00:36:26,314 --> 00:36:27,097
- No.

496
00:36:29,361 --> 00:36:30,144
- Why not?

497
00:36:32,102 --> 00:36:35,193
- 'Cause it doesn't make
sense for both of US to go.

498
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,803
She's my grandma.

499
00:36:39,371 --> 00:36:40,720
- Okay.

500
00:36:42,243 --> 00:36:44,811
- You should, you
should take off.

501
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:46,726
I'm gonna hit the road.

502
00:36:49,598 --> 00:36:50,338
- Alright.

503
00:36:53,298 --> 00:36:54,908
I love you.

504
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:57,563
- Yeah.

505
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:44,566
- Have you heard anything
about your appeal?

506
00:37:44,653 --> 00:37:46,525
- Not yet.

507
00:37:46,612 --> 00:37:49,049
I'm supposed to see
the lawyer today

508
00:37:49,136 --> 00:37:53,096
but I don't expect much
in the way of good news.

509
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:57,362
How are you, young lady?

510
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:58,232
- Okay.

511
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,064
- Tell your father what you
made on your report card.

512
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:09,722
- I know how smart you are
so I can probably guess.

513
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:11,898
- Tell him, Laney.

514
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:13,378
- All as, one b.

515
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:14,944
- Wow.

516
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:18,252
- It would've been all
as but Mr. Pascer lost

517
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:20,559
one of my papers.

518
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:23,866
- That's still really good.

519
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:25,955
- She works really hard.

520
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,396
We should probably get going.

521
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:35,225
- Okay when can I expect
to see you two again?

522
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:41,623
- We'll be back, okay?

523
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,451
Tell your father
good bye, Laney.

524
00:38:43,538 --> 00:38:46,324
- Laney, will you touch my hand?

525
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:53,331
Daddy loves you,
never forget that.

526
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,248
- Let's go, baby.
- Love you.

527
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:38,376
- Now don't waste those
tears on me, I'm okay.

528
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:42,380
- I don't understand,
you're fine.

529
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,077
We were over here just last week

530
00:39:44,164 --> 00:39:45,426
and you seemed fine.

531
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:50,388
- I don't spend my time
asking those questions.

532
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:55,828
And my advice to you is
you don't ask them either.

533
00:39:55,915 --> 00:39:57,569
The more questions you
ask the better chance

534
00:39:57,656 --> 00:40:01,529
you have of getting
answers you don't like.

535
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:04,271
- What can I do?

536
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:05,403
What do you need?

537
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:10,495
- Same thing we
all need, prayers.

538
00:40:10,582 --> 00:40:11,365
- Oh mom.

539
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:14,890
I can't sit here

540
00:40:16,457 --> 00:40:19,591
and see you like this
and close my eyes

541
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:22,768
and ask for a miracle.

542
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:26,380
I'm not gonna sit
here waiting for that.

543
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:29,862
- Honey you're forgetting
something you once knew.

544
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:33,387
We don't wait for
miracles to happen

545
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:35,737
the miracle's waiting for US.

546
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:41,134
- How can you be so strong?

547
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:46,574
I can't be that strong after
every thing that's happened.

548
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:51,753
Especially not after this.

549
00:40:55,278 --> 00:40:58,673
- Being strong takes the
same effort as being weak.

550
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,850
It's just the road
you decide to take.

551
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,506
- You say these things,

552
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,685
and I really wanna
believe them I really do.

553
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:14,863
But at the end of the day,

554
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:21,696
mama, you're still gonna
be laying here dying.

555
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:24,656
- Well that's the road
you're choosing to take.

556
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:27,136
Luckily it's not a dead end.

557
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:31,358
I'll handle your
prayers for you.

558
00:41:32,664 --> 00:41:34,709
Baby I know you're hurtin'.

559
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:39,671
After all you've been through.

560
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:43,457
Nobody would blame you
if you never recovered.

561
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:48,636
- What am I supposed to do?

562
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:52,814
- Build around pain.

563
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:03,782
Build happiness around
all of your heartaches.

564
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:06,915
When you do that,
you'll see the dawn.

565
00:42:09,788 --> 00:42:12,181
Oh mom.

566
00:42:12,268 --> 00:42:13,269
- It's okay.

567
00:43:48,016 --> 00:43:49,757
John Archer?

568
00:43:51,237 --> 00:43:53,587
Don't even act like you
don't know who I am.

569
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:54,675
- Sissy?

570
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,590
Get over here.

571
00:43:57,678 --> 00:43:59,245
Wow.

572
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:00,550
You grew up.

573
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,378
- Not a little girl anymore.

574
00:44:02,465 --> 00:44:05,207
- I guess not,
how's your brother?

575
00:44:06,818 --> 00:44:09,342
Boy you really
did get out of here, huh?

576
00:44:09,429 --> 00:44:12,127
I don't understand.

577
00:44:12,214 --> 00:44:16,654
- John, Antwan died last fall.

578
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:19,657
He was killed in Iraq.

579
00:44:19,744 --> 00:44:22,572
I can't believe you didn't know.

580
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:27,360
- No.

581
00:44:27,447 --> 00:44:28,491
No that can't be true.

582
00:44:28,578 --> 00:44:31,538
Someone would've told me that.

583
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:32,278
- He's dead.

584
00:44:33,845 --> 00:44:37,675
I guess when you left
aiken, aiken left you, huh?

585
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:43,115
- Sissy, I'm sorry,
I didn't know.

586
00:44:43,202 --> 00:44:46,945
Don't apologize,
he's an angel now.

587
00:44:47,032 --> 00:44:48,424
He's doing fine.

588
00:44:49,774 --> 00:44:50,775
- Yeah.

589
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:56,737
Yeah well if angels exist.

590
00:44:56,824 --> 00:44:59,871
I've no doubt Antwan
has his wings.

591
00:45:03,526 --> 00:45:06,747
Look I should really get going.

592
00:45:06,834 --> 00:45:09,402
Tell your mother I said hello.

593
00:45:09,489 --> 00:45:11,012
I will.

594
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:12,710
- It's good to see you.

595
00:45:12,797 --> 00:45:16,148
It's good
to see you too John.

596
00:46:10,898 --> 00:46:13,031
- This isn't about US, okay?

597
00:46:16,556 --> 00:46:17,862
Can we do this?

598
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,390
- We can do it if
we don't speak.

599
00:46:25,913 --> 00:46:29,047
That's something we
should be used to.

600
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:32,964
- Are you gonna at
least let me know

601
00:46:33,051 --> 00:46:35,053
what I'm about to walk into?

602
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:40,841
- What's in there is
what brought you here.

603
00:46:40,928 --> 00:46:43,191
Answer your own question.

604
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,753
I'm back.

605
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,060
Good to see you grandpa.

606
00:47:26,147 --> 00:47:27,583
How are you doing?

607
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:30,195
- Okay, okay.
- Yeah, how is she?

608
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:34,982
- Depends upon who you ask.

609
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:36,331
- I'm asking you.

610
00:47:38,116 --> 00:47:39,639
- It's in god's hands.

611
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,165
Is that your
way of not answering me?

612
00:47:44,252 --> 00:47:47,865
- Is that your way
of not hearing me?

613
00:47:47,952 --> 00:47:51,216
- Can I ask you something?
- What's that?

614
00:47:51,303 --> 00:47:54,872
- How come nobody
told me about Antwan?

615
00:47:54,959 --> 00:47:57,004
- What difference
would it have made?

616
00:47:57,091 --> 00:47:59,877
- He was my best friend.

617
00:47:59,964 --> 00:48:02,967
- Would you have
come to his services?

618
00:48:06,405 --> 00:48:08,407
Your grandmother
wanted to tell you.

619
00:48:08,494 --> 00:48:10,452
I told her not to.

620
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:13,107
Figure you had enough
on your plate as it is.

621
00:48:13,194 --> 00:48:15,936
- Well it still would've
been nice to know.

622
00:48:16,023 --> 00:48:18,939
Could've saved me some
embarrassment today.

623
00:48:19,026 --> 00:48:20,854
- Sorry.

624
00:48:20,941 --> 00:48:22,725
We should've told you.

625
00:48:32,387 --> 00:48:34,824
- So what's the plan?

626
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,436
- The plan John boy is
for US to keep doing

627
00:48:37,523 --> 00:48:41,092
what we've been doing
for what two years now?

628
00:48:44,008 --> 00:48:45,618
Being here for mama.

629
00:48:45,705 --> 00:48:48,621
- I can't change the fact
that I haven't been here.

630
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:50,623
Alright but let's
figure something out

631
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:52,364
because I'm here now.

632
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:55,367
- John?
- Yeah?

633
00:48:55,454 --> 00:48:56,281
Is that you?

634
00:48:56,368 --> 00:48:58,283
- Yeah, grandma, it's me.

635
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:17,563
- God knows I've watched
that woman upstairs

636
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:21,784
cry herself to sleep, praying
for you two to fix this.

637
00:49:24,439 --> 00:49:27,877
I've watched it too many times.

638
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:31,098
I'm not gonna do it now.

639
00:49:31,185 --> 00:49:33,187
- I don't know what
you want from me daddy.

640
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:36,495
- It's not a matter of knowing,
it's a matter of doing.

641
00:49:36,582 --> 00:49:37,975
- So now it's my fault.

642
00:49:38,062 --> 00:49:41,239
- Fault and taking
responsibility don't always go

643
00:49:41,326 --> 00:49:44,938
hand in hand.

644
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:48,072
You can have one
without the other.

645
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,600
- Tell me what I can do.

646
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,256
- Well, I've been
waiting a long time

647
00:49:58,343 --> 00:50:02,521
to hear you ask
me that.

648
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:08,266
- What's this?

649
00:50:10,268 --> 00:50:13,010
- What it is isn't important

650
00:50:13,097 --> 00:50:16,665
but what it will be,
will truly amaze you.

651
00:50:18,493 --> 00:50:19,233
- Okay.

652
00:50:21,192 --> 00:50:22,976
Okay are you...

653
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:27,415
At least gonna tell me
what I need to do with it?

654
00:50:27,502 --> 00:50:29,635
- When it feels right, open it.

655
00:50:29,722 --> 00:50:33,204
Page one will start
you on a journey.

656
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:37,817
- I'm not so sure I'm ready
for a journey right now.

657
00:50:40,124 --> 00:50:41,777
- Do it for me.

658
00:50:43,257 --> 00:50:47,261
Promise, promise
you'll do it for me.

659
00:50:48,828 --> 00:50:53,833
- Okay, promise.

660
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,881
- You have something so
special inside of you John.

661
00:51:01,014 --> 00:51:03,625
But it's up to
you to let it out.

662
00:51:07,194 --> 00:51:10,458
When you do, oh my.

663
00:51:11,981 --> 00:51:15,115
God's artwork will
be on full display.

664
00:51:18,205 --> 00:51:22,122
- Why do I feel like
you're telling me good bye?

665
00:51:27,954 --> 00:51:29,564
- No good byes.

666
00:51:31,653 --> 00:51:33,525
Just an introduction
to the potential

667
00:51:33,612 --> 00:51:36,180
that I know god has given you.

668
00:51:41,707 --> 00:51:43,274
- I've missed you.

669
00:51:49,236 --> 00:51:53,371
- Daddy I can't just sit around
here and see her like this.

670
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:59,507
I can't sit around here and
pretend like everything's okay.

671
00:52:03,946 --> 00:52:04,730
What?

672
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:08,951
- What do you want me to say?

673
00:52:10,649 --> 00:52:14,522
Clearly everything I've said
so far hasn't helped, so...

674
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:17,656
I'm here to do
whatever I need to do.

675
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,183
- Get some rest, you're tried.

676
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,403
We're all tired.

677
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,100
Rest could go a long way.

678
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:29,407
- No, I'm fine.

679
00:52:29,494 --> 00:52:32,366
If you don't need
me here for awhile,

680
00:52:32,453 --> 00:52:36,283
I'm gonna take a
walk, clear my head.

681
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:24,201
- Hey, hey!

682
00:53:26,028 --> 00:53:28,379
Is that aiken's own Picasso?

683
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:30,990
Oh man.

684
00:53:32,383 --> 00:53:34,254
Man, it's like seeing a ghost.

685
00:53:34,341 --> 00:53:36,909
Heck the whole town thought
you'd done curled up and died.

686
00:53:36,996 --> 00:53:39,303
- Nope, I'm alive.

687
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:42,436
- Man now folks if you
y'all don't know here,

688
00:53:42,523 --> 00:53:44,917
well John boy is one of
aiken's few claims to fame.

689
00:53:46,527 --> 00:53:49,574
Now hang on, hang on this
will just take a second.

690
00:53:49,661 --> 00:53:51,619
What was I saying?

691
00:53:51,706 --> 00:53:54,231
Oh yeah aiken's fame to claim.

692
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:56,668
Listen if you guys need
a picture or a painting

693
00:53:56,755 --> 00:54:00,324
or anything, he's your man.

694
00:54:00,411 --> 00:54:05,416
On the other hand, if you
wanna keep your kid alive.

695
00:54:05,503 --> 00:54:07,200
John Archer may not
be the way to go.

696
00:54:07,287 --> 00:54:09,594
Just stop it.

697
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:12,814
- It's fine, I know the sound
of alcohol when I hear it.

698
00:54:12,901 --> 00:54:14,947
- I'm sorry, everyone
calm down, calm down,

699
00:54:15,034 --> 00:54:18,211
we're just playing, having
fun, right John boy?

700
00:54:18,298 --> 00:54:21,388
- Yeah, whatever
you wanna call it.

701
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:24,739
- Hey wait, wait, wait.

702
00:54:24,826 --> 00:54:27,612
Before you go, let's just say

703
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:30,092
I wanted to have someone offed.

704
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:34,662
Do I have to call you or set
up some kind of appointment?

705
00:54:34,749 --> 00:54:36,142
How's that work?

706
00:54:37,143 --> 00:54:37,883
What?

707
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,799
What, you all booked up?

708
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:44,324
Hey, hey, hey.

709
00:54:44,411 --> 00:54:48,546
- Do not pretend like
you know me, okay?

710
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:50,809
Get off me, John.

711
00:54:53,507 --> 00:54:56,205
- Laugh all you want, Jake.

712
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,207
I don't feel a thing.

713
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:25,365
I don't doubt you're up there.

714
00:55:25,452 --> 00:55:27,149
I doubt your motives.

715
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:33,895
I need to know why you
are doing this to me.

716
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:41,250
I was always told that you
wouldn't give US anything

717
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:45,472
more than we can handle
and yet here I am.

718
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:48,214
I'm clearly broken
and yet you insist

719
00:55:48,301 --> 00:55:52,044
on giving me more pain
so either break me,

720
00:55:52,131 --> 00:55:55,177
I don't care, break
me or let me be

721
00:55:55,264 --> 00:55:57,441
because I hate where I am.

722
00:56:01,227 --> 00:56:03,142
I'm sick of this.

723
00:56:24,032 --> 00:56:25,730
And through him
to reconcile upon himself

724
00:56:25,817 --> 00:56:28,863
all things whether on
earth or in heaven,

725
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:31,475
making peace by the
blood of his cross,

726
00:56:31,562 --> 00:56:34,216
you who once were alienated
and hostile in mind

727
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:36,654
doing evil deeds,
he is now reconciled

728
00:56:36,741 --> 00:56:39,091
in his body of
flesh by his death.

729
00:56:39,178 --> 00:56:41,485
In order to present
you holy and blameless

730
00:56:41,572 --> 00:56:43,748
in the above
reproach before him.

731
00:56:43,835 --> 00:56:46,011
It's not the paths in life
that make US who we are,

732
00:56:46,098 --> 00:56:49,580
it's the obstacles we forged
through along those paths.

733
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:51,538
Although this
journey is specific,

734
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:54,411
it's a journey that
can be taken by anyone.

735
00:56:54,498 --> 00:56:56,761
Obstacle one.

736
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,240
If I'm honest, i'm
shocked to see you, John.

737
00:57:41,327 --> 00:57:44,722
- They didn't tell
you who was here?

738
00:57:44,809 --> 00:57:48,552
- Common courtesy is
sparse inside these walls.

739
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:50,162
I'm not sure i'd
believe them anyhow

740
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:51,772
seeing our history and all.

741
00:57:51,859 --> 00:57:55,559
- Look I'm just gonna
cut to the chase,

742
00:57:55,646 --> 00:57:58,083
my grandmother's dying.

743
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:59,606
Doctor said it's day to day.

744
00:57:59,693 --> 00:58:01,086
Now can you tell me,

745
00:58:01,173 --> 00:58:03,001
whether that be of any
importance to you.

746
00:58:03,088 --> 00:58:04,742
- But that can't be true.

747
00:58:04,829 --> 00:58:06,395
I saw her no more
than a few days ago.

748
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,919
She acted like she was fine.

749
00:58:08,006 --> 00:58:09,747
- That might be the
case but apparently

750
00:58:09,834 --> 00:58:13,620
she hasn't been
fine in awhile now.

751
00:58:13,707 --> 00:58:15,448
She was diagnosed with
stage three stomach cancer

752
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:18,059
over a year ago.

753
00:58:21,323 --> 00:58:23,500
What, you find that funny?

754
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:28,809
- No, no, it's not
funny, not in the least.

755
00:58:28,896 --> 00:58:30,594
It just figures.

756
00:58:32,247 --> 00:58:34,032
Mrs. Archer thought so
much of other people,

757
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:35,816
she wouldn't even
let on she had cancer

758
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,339
for fear of putting
the slightest bit

759
00:58:37,426 --> 00:58:39,428
of attention on herself.

760
00:58:43,737 --> 00:58:48,176
Was there something I
can help you with, John?

761
00:58:48,263 --> 00:58:51,136
- I'm not here for myself.

762
00:58:51,223 --> 00:58:54,095
I am certainly not here for you.

763
00:58:54,182 --> 00:58:55,488
She asked me to come see you.

764
00:58:55,575 --> 00:58:58,752
I felt like I owed
it to her to do so.

765
00:59:00,493 --> 00:59:02,451
Here I am.

766
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,541
Now I would like to
know what you have to do

767
00:59:04,628 --> 00:59:06,325
with my grandmother.

768
00:59:10,764 --> 00:59:13,593
- I'd apologize again if I
thought it meant anything.

769
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,683
- It wouldn't,
answer the question.

770
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:19,686
- May I be allowed to
explain the unexplainable.

771
00:59:19,773 --> 00:59:22,167
- She has me here
for some reason.

772
00:59:22,254 --> 00:59:23,821
Explain it so it
makes sense to me,

773
00:59:23,908 --> 00:59:27,433
and try doing it
without being so casual.

774
00:59:30,088 --> 00:59:32,743
- Well let me start by
saying my casual spirit

775
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:36,485
as you call it is not
meant to be disrespectful,

776
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,922
not in the slightest.

777
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,099
Brother, spirit's all
we have in this place.

778
00:59:41,186 --> 00:59:43,144
- Oh forgive me if I don't
have sympathy for you.

779
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,190
- I don't expect it.

780
00:59:45,277 --> 00:59:47,584
I expect sympathy from no one.

781
00:59:48,846 --> 00:59:51,413
I know what I've done.

782
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,547
I know what I'm guilty of.

783
00:59:54,634 --> 00:59:57,506
But I ask you to
understand that I am not

784
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:01,598
the same man you were
staring at two years ago.

785
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:03,425
- Correct me if I'm wrong,

786
01:00:03,512 --> 01:00:06,341
isn't that what everybody
says in this place?

787
01:00:06,428 --> 01:00:08,126
Of course
they do and most

788
01:00:08,213 --> 01:00:10,041
of them sincerely mean it.

789
01:00:11,738 --> 01:00:15,612
- Just tell me what you have
to do with my grandmother.

790
01:00:20,225 --> 01:00:21,618
- My guess.

791
01:00:22,531 --> 01:00:24,621
She changed my life.

792
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:27,972
Maybe she wants me
to change yours too.

793
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:32,193
- What could you
possibly do for me?

794
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,674
You're the one stuck
inside these walls.

795
01:00:34,761 --> 01:00:37,634
- Please don't assume
these walls take my freedom

796
01:00:37,721 --> 01:00:41,899
and don't assume being
outside of them keeps yours.

797
01:00:44,379 --> 01:00:45,729
Besides who better to learn from

798
01:00:45,816 --> 01:00:49,167
than the man who's
been to hell and back.

799
01:00:49,254 --> 01:00:52,518
Tell me what
I'm here to know.

800
01:01:02,702 --> 01:01:04,051
- Time's up, John.

801
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:07,925
You know where to find me.

802
01:01:42,524 --> 01:01:45,440
And are justified
by his grace as a gift

803
01:01:45,527 --> 01:01:47,747
through the redemption
that is in Christ Jesus

804
01:01:47,834 --> 01:01:50,663
whom god put forward as a
propitiation by his blood

805
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,970
to be received by faith.

806
01:01:53,057 --> 01:01:54,623
This was to show
god's righteousness

807
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,625
because in his
divine forbearance

808
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,628
he had passed over former sins.

809
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,153
It was to show his righteousness
at the present times

810
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,851
so that he might be
just and the justifier

811
01:02:04,938 --> 01:02:07,854
of the one who
has faith in Jesus

812
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:09,769
obstacle two.

813
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:15,601
How was the pool?

814
01:02:15,688 --> 01:02:16,733
- It was fun.

815
01:02:26,525 --> 01:02:28,875
Daddy, you gotta eat.

816
01:02:30,311 --> 01:02:32,836
- Not that hungry
for some reason.

817
01:02:32,923 --> 01:02:35,012
- What have you eaten today?

818
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,797
- I reckon I haven't.

819
01:02:37,884 --> 01:02:39,233
- Nothing all day?

820
01:02:42,671 --> 01:02:45,413
Well you gotta eat something.

821
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,850
James.

822
01:02:50,636 --> 01:02:53,378
- You're eating something
when you get back.

823
01:02:53,465 --> 01:02:57,643
You need to sit
down and eat something.

824
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:04,911
- Hey.

825
01:03:06,957 --> 01:03:09,089
Sorry I didn't
mean to interrupt.

826
01:03:09,176 --> 01:03:13,920
- Don't be silly,
grab something to eat.

827
01:03:14,007 --> 01:03:17,968
- Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

828
01:03:18,055 --> 01:03:18,795
- Alright.

829
01:03:20,753 --> 01:03:21,536
What's up.

830
01:03:22,494 --> 01:03:23,756
Hey, stranger.

831
01:03:23,843 --> 01:03:27,281
- Hey uncle John.
- How are ya.

832
01:03:27,368 --> 01:03:29,370
Robert.
- Welcome home.

833
01:03:29,457 --> 01:03:30,458
- Thank you.

834
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:35,942
So where's grandpa?

835
01:03:37,988 --> 01:03:40,599
- Your mother's
upstairs resting.

836
01:03:40,686 --> 01:03:43,558
Your father went to be with her.

837
01:03:43,645 --> 01:03:46,344
How's she been feeling?

838
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:49,042
- Her spirits seem to be high.

839
01:03:49,129 --> 01:03:50,304
- That's good.

840
01:03:51,871 --> 01:03:54,831
- Where have you been all day?

841
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:57,485
- Trying to fulfill a promise.

842
01:03:59,052 --> 01:04:02,839
One that looks
like I can't keep.

843
01:04:10,977 --> 01:04:11,760
- What?

844
01:04:15,808 --> 01:04:18,376
- She said she knew it was time.

845
01:04:20,291 --> 01:04:23,903
Closed her eyes
and drifted away.

846
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,071
- Why didn't she ask for me?

847
01:05:03,116 --> 01:05:05,727
- She said her
peace to everyone.

848
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,082
Revisited a peaceful moment

849
01:05:13,779 --> 01:05:15,781
makes the peace at risk.

850
01:05:18,175 --> 01:05:22,005
She wanted to be remembered
by nothing but a smile.

851
01:05:43,591 --> 01:05:44,984
Excuse me.

852
01:05:54,037 --> 01:05:55,690
It's okay.

853
01:05:59,477 --> 01:06:01,435
If a man
vows a vow to the lord

854
01:06:01,522 --> 01:06:04,351
or swears an oath to
bind himself by a pledge,

855
01:06:04,438 --> 01:06:06,049
he shall not break his word.

856
01:06:06,136 --> 01:06:09,008
He shall do according to all
the proceeds out of his mouth

857
01:06:09,095 --> 01:06:10,705
and whenever you stand praying,

858
01:06:10,792 --> 01:06:12,925
forgive, if you have
anything against anyone

859
01:06:13,012 --> 01:06:15,232
so that your father
also who is in heaven

860
01:06:15,319 --> 01:06:17,712
may forgive you your trespasses.

861
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:20,150
Obstacle three.

862
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:36,557
- Hey there.
- Hey.

863
01:06:38,168 --> 01:06:39,647
How are things?

864
01:06:39,734 --> 01:06:41,736
Good as always.

865
01:06:41,823 --> 01:06:42,737
- Hey baby.

866
01:06:44,739 --> 01:06:45,523
- Hey.

867
01:06:50,354 --> 01:06:52,965
Can I help you?

868
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:56,925
- You may not remember
me, but I'm John--

869
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:57,796
- Archer.

870
01:06:59,189 --> 01:07:00,625
- Right.

871
01:07:00,712 --> 01:07:01,974
How can I help you?

872
01:07:02,061 --> 01:07:04,716
- Do you have a minute to talk?

873
01:07:06,326 --> 01:07:09,112
- What do we have to talk about?

874
01:07:10,896 --> 01:07:12,550
- I'm not sure exactly.

875
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:15,988
- Gabby, can you give
me just a minute?

876
01:07:16,075 --> 01:07:18,077
- Of course.
- Okay.

877
01:07:27,086 --> 01:07:30,046
What did you need
to talk to me about?

878
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:33,875
- Well I guess I
should start by saying

879
01:07:33,962 --> 01:07:37,140
I met with your
husband yesterday.

880
01:07:37,227 --> 01:07:39,838
- And why would you do that?

881
01:07:39,925 --> 01:07:42,667
I'm not
sure of that either.

882
01:07:42,754 --> 01:07:45,844
It comes down to a promise
I made to my grandmother,

883
01:07:45,931 --> 01:07:49,978
the rest I'm trying
to figure out.

884
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:54,635
- I really hate to
ask this John, but...

885
01:07:54,722 --> 01:07:58,030
I'm a very busy girl,
what exactly do you need?

886
01:07:58,117 --> 01:08:00,467
When was the last
time you saw your husband?

887
01:08:00,554 --> 01:08:02,513
- Why?

888
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,950
- I'm just trying to
complete a puzzle here

889
01:08:05,037 --> 01:08:09,955
and I don't even think
I have the right pieces.

890
01:08:10,042 --> 01:08:13,654
- I take my daughter in
once a month to see him.

891
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:15,961
We stay for a few
minutes and then leave.

892
01:08:16,048 --> 01:08:17,702
Then I spend the next
month trying to forget

893
01:08:17,789 --> 01:08:19,356
I sat in front of him.

894
01:08:20,792 --> 01:08:23,447
- Have you noticed
a change in him?

895
01:08:23,534 --> 01:08:26,102
- Of course, look
at what he did.

896
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:31,281
When you're at rock bottom,
there's only one way to go.

897
01:08:31,368 --> 01:08:35,937
- I don't know why,
but for some reason,

898
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:38,984
he had a relationship
with my grandmother.

899
01:08:39,071 --> 01:08:41,682
A profound
relationship it seems.

900
01:08:44,163 --> 01:08:45,904
- Noah's a lot of things
but there's nothing

901
01:08:45,991 --> 01:08:47,297
profound about him.

902
01:08:47,384 --> 01:08:48,950
- I think that's
where my grandmother

903
01:08:49,037 --> 01:08:51,823
saw things differently.

904
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:54,042
It may even be why I'm here.

905
01:08:55,653 --> 01:08:59,265
- If that's the case then
you're wasting your time.

906
01:08:59,352 --> 01:09:03,008
- Look I'm not trying
to change your thinking.

907
01:09:03,095 --> 01:09:06,490
I can't even get mine to change.

908
01:09:06,577 --> 01:09:08,753
The next time you see him,

909
01:09:10,233 --> 01:09:14,019
be open to the fact
that he's a changed man.

910
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:21,200
- I can't even
comprehend the pain

911
01:09:21,287 --> 01:09:23,724
that he's caused your family.

912
01:09:25,378 --> 01:09:29,730
My daughter, she's still
sittin' in that house alive.

913
01:09:29,817 --> 01:09:33,169
If you're open to the fact
that he's not a monster,

914
01:09:33,256 --> 01:09:35,649
then maybe I can try it too.

915
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:40,393
Yeah.

916
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,526
I need to get back inside.

917
01:09:42,613 --> 01:09:44,354
- This may sound really strange,

918
01:09:44,441 --> 01:09:49,141
but is there any way I
can meet your daughter.

919
01:09:49,228 --> 01:09:50,273
- Yeah, sure.

920
01:09:53,667 --> 01:09:54,451
Laney.

921
01:10:00,065 --> 01:10:02,328
Someone here i'd
like you to meet.

922
01:10:02,415 --> 01:10:05,375
This is John.
- Hi Laney.

923
01:10:05,462 --> 01:10:07,115
It's nice to meet you.

924
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:10,031
- Nice to meet you, John Archer.

925
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:13,687
- It was good to meet you too.

926
01:10:13,774 --> 01:10:14,949
Me too.

927
01:10:16,473 --> 01:10:19,998
- I should get going,
but thanks again.

928
01:10:20,085 --> 01:10:22,174
You're welcome.

929
01:10:54,206 --> 01:10:54,946
- Price?

930
01:10:57,644 --> 01:10:59,603
What are you doing here?

931
01:11:05,957 --> 01:11:07,611
How'd you know where to find me?

932
01:11:07,698 --> 01:11:09,308
- There's this little diner
like right when

933
01:11:09,395 --> 01:11:11,223
I got into aiken,
gave me this address.

934
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:13,486
Said I might find you here.

935
01:11:13,573 --> 01:11:15,314
- Well you should've called.

936
01:11:15,401 --> 01:11:17,316
Would've saved you the
trouble of hunting me down.

937
01:11:17,403 --> 01:11:20,319
- It's no trouble, I kinda
wanted to surprise ya.

938
01:11:20,406 --> 01:11:23,235
- Yeah, well you did.

939
01:11:23,322 --> 01:11:24,845
Thanks for coming.

940
01:11:24,932 --> 01:11:27,195
- How's your grandma doing?

941
01:11:29,415 --> 01:11:31,939
- She passed away last night.

942
01:11:32,026 --> 01:11:33,985
- John no, I'm so sorry.

943
01:11:35,682 --> 01:11:38,642
It's okay, it's okay.

944
01:11:38,729 --> 01:11:42,472
- You're a terrible liar,
you know that right?

945
01:11:44,343 --> 01:11:46,824
- How would you like
to meet my family?

946
01:11:46,911 --> 01:11:48,434
- I would really like that.

947
01:12:05,886 --> 01:12:08,846
Grandpa, i'd
like you to meet price.

948
01:12:08,933 --> 01:12:10,413
Hello.

949
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,198
- I just heard, I'm so
sorry for your loss.

950
01:12:13,285 --> 01:12:14,330
- Thank you.

951
01:12:14,417 --> 01:12:16,680
- I know she was a great woman.

952
01:12:16,767 --> 01:12:18,812
It's good to finally
meet you though, sir.

953
01:12:18,899 --> 01:12:20,988
I've heard lots of
wonderful things.

954
01:12:21,075 --> 01:12:22,163
Sir.

955
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:24,296
How old do you think I am?

956
01:12:24,383 --> 01:12:26,733
I'm thinking late 20s.

957
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:29,083
Smart girl.

958
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:31,172
- Price, this is Rachel.

959
01:12:32,565 --> 01:12:36,090
- It's nice to meet you.
- You too.

960
01:12:36,177 --> 01:12:38,005
- Where are Robert and the kids?

961
01:12:38,092 --> 01:12:40,051
- He took the kids home.

962
01:12:41,226 --> 01:12:42,445
- Hey grandpa is it alright

963
01:12:42,532 --> 01:12:43,707
if price takes
the guest bedroom?

964
01:12:43,794 --> 01:12:45,317
- Of course.

965
01:12:45,404 --> 01:12:47,928
- Thank you, I'm gonna
stay out of y'all's hair,

966
01:12:48,015 --> 01:12:49,365
I just really wanted to come by

967
01:12:49,452 --> 01:12:51,497
and meet you guys and
let you know my family's

968
01:12:51,584 --> 01:12:52,890
been praying for you all.

969
01:12:52,977 --> 01:12:54,413
- Thank you.

970
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,110
- I'm gonna go grab
my bag out of the car.

971
01:12:56,197 --> 01:12:57,895
- I can get it.
- No it's fine, stay.

972
01:12:57,982 --> 01:13:00,376
I'll be right back.
- Alright.

973
01:13:03,553 --> 01:13:07,948
- She's great, John.
- Yeah, yeah, she is.

974
01:13:08,035 --> 01:13:10,777
- Daddy, do you need me
to stay here tonight?

975
01:13:10,864 --> 01:13:13,476
I don't,
I'll be just fine.

976
01:13:13,563 --> 01:13:15,608
- Yeah, you should go
home, get some rest.

977
01:13:15,695 --> 01:13:16,783
I'll be here.

978
01:13:17,871 --> 01:13:19,003
- Okay.

979
01:13:20,961 --> 01:13:23,399
- Come on, I'll take
you to your room.

980
01:13:23,486 --> 01:13:24,835
It was good
to meet you both.

981
01:13:24,922 --> 01:13:27,228
Nice meeting you.

982
01:13:44,681 --> 01:13:47,423
This room's so roomy.

983
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:49,512
- My grandmother
loved her house.

984
01:13:49,599 --> 01:13:50,643
- I can tell.

985
01:13:58,912 --> 01:13:59,913
You know...

986
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:05,005
You're kind of like a
book I've had for awhile.

987
01:14:05,092 --> 01:14:08,574
Just never really opened it.

988
01:14:08,661 --> 01:14:10,010
I keep reading the
front and back cover

989
01:14:10,097 --> 01:14:13,623
but I never look
at the whole story.

990
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:15,233
- What do you wanna know?

991
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:16,843
- Everything.

992
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:20,368
- Well you have to
start somewhere.

993
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,458
- Is Rachel your sister?

994
01:14:24,242 --> 01:14:26,549
- I have a long book.

995
01:14:26,636 --> 01:14:28,899
- What else do we have to do?

996
01:14:31,075 --> 01:14:32,555
- Okay.

997
01:14:34,644 --> 01:14:38,430
You know that my mom died
when I was real little,

998
01:14:38,517 --> 01:14:39,910
I told you that.

999
01:14:41,346 --> 01:14:43,261
Grandfather and
grandmother aren't really

1000
01:14:43,348 --> 01:14:46,482
the only parents I've known.

1001
01:14:46,569 --> 01:14:50,486
So aunt Rachel became
my sister Rachel.

1002
01:14:52,879 --> 01:14:57,318
We just never felt like
siblings because of the age gap.

1003
01:14:57,405 --> 01:14:59,495
We still had that same hatred

1004
01:14:59,582 --> 01:15:03,847
that some siblings have
just none of the closeness.

1005
01:15:07,111 --> 01:15:13,509
That gap became a
canyon after that night.

1006
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:16,686
- Your sister blames you.
- Yeah.

1007
01:15:16,773 --> 01:15:18,296
Yeah, she should.

1008
01:15:19,602 --> 01:15:21,908
I would blame me.

1009
01:15:23,954 --> 01:15:29,350
I've tried everything to
get it out of my head.

1010
01:15:33,006 --> 01:15:34,268
You look tired.

1011
01:15:35,269 --> 01:15:36,053
- I am.

1012
01:15:37,141 --> 01:15:39,056
- Chapter two soon?

1013
01:15:59,206 --> 01:16:03,167
How did I know
I would find you in here?

1014
01:16:03,254 --> 01:16:06,213
- Probably because this
is where I always come

1015
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:13,090
when I have words to say
and no idea how to say them.

1016
01:16:13,177 --> 01:16:15,135
What are you still doing up?

1017
01:16:15,222 --> 01:16:18,095
- Probably the same
reason you are.

1018
01:16:19,923 --> 01:16:22,708
Nowadays it seems
we get so focused

1019
01:16:22,795 --> 01:16:25,406
on the minutia of the
possible reactions

1020
01:16:25,493 --> 01:16:29,062
to our words that we end
up not saying the things

1021
01:16:29,149 --> 01:16:32,152
that so badly need to be heard.

1022
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:35,503
- Yeah well based
on my track record,

1023
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:39,116
whatever I have to say
really needs to be heard.

1024
01:16:39,203 --> 01:16:41,771
- So says the man saying them.

1025
01:16:41,858 --> 01:16:45,035
Have you ever asked
the folks hearing it?

1026
01:16:46,819 --> 01:16:50,083
I hate to hear about people
talking about failures.

1027
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:52,738
Failure is not easy.

1028
01:16:52,825 --> 01:16:54,566
Failure takes effort.

1029
01:16:56,133 --> 01:16:58,918
Where do we get off
complaining about not getting

1030
01:16:59,005 --> 01:17:02,574
the results we want or need

1031
01:17:02,661 --> 01:17:08,058
when we didn't even try to
get them in the first place?

1032
01:17:08,145 --> 01:17:10,669
This family has had
to endure a tragedy

1033
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:15,195
of a kind I wouldn't
wish upon a worst enemy.

1034
01:17:15,282 --> 01:17:18,677
But for the first time
since it happened,

1035
01:17:18,764 --> 01:17:24,117
it seems we're making strides
to be a family once again.

1036
01:17:24,204 --> 01:17:26,119
There's nothing in the
world your grandmother

1037
01:17:26,206 --> 01:17:29,993
wanted more than to
have that happen.

1038
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:35,128
Don't let your fear of words

1039
01:17:35,215 --> 01:17:39,655
prevent US from taking
another step closer.

1040
01:17:39,742 --> 01:17:41,700
You'll figure it out.

1041
01:17:41,787 --> 01:17:44,181
I have something for you.

1042
01:17:44,268 --> 01:17:45,748
Come with me.

1043
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,771
- She still is beautiful.

1044
01:18:18,171 --> 01:18:18,694
No.

1045
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:22,741
No, grandpa, I
don't deserve this.

1046
01:18:22,828 --> 01:18:25,309
- Don't be silly, it's your car.

1047
01:18:25,396 --> 01:18:27,180
- No, seriously grandpa.

1048
01:18:27,267 --> 01:18:29,052
I can't take this.

1049
01:18:30,444 --> 01:18:33,752
- Cars have more
forgiveness than we do.

1050
01:18:36,886 --> 01:18:37,843
- Thank you.

1051
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:42,195
Good night.

1052
01:18:42,282 --> 01:18:44,371
- Grandpa?

1053
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:52,466
Look, I want to say
the right things.

1054
01:18:52,553 --> 01:18:54,642
I just don't think I can.

1055
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,820
- I think you can.

1056
01:18:57,907 --> 01:19:02,825
More importantly
god knows you can.

1057
01:19:02,912 --> 01:19:04,740
You just gotta have faith.

1058
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:09,701
- I've heard that word a
lot in the past few days.

1059
01:19:13,487 --> 01:19:17,274
I don't think I have
any faith right now.

1060
01:19:17,361 --> 01:19:21,452
Honestly I'm not
sure I ever did.

1061
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:26,849
- You may not have faith
but one thing I can promise,

1062
01:19:26,936 --> 01:19:29,242
faith has you, kid.

1063
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,624
- What?

1064
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:09,805
- Can we please stop this?

1065
01:20:11,763 --> 01:20:13,417
Stop what?

1066
01:20:13,504 --> 01:20:15,419
- Stop this.

1067
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,815
This thing that we do everyday.

1068
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:32,044
Rachel I don't know if
I can take it anymore.

1069
01:20:32,131 --> 01:20:34,655
I don't know what that means.

1070
01:20:36,919 --> 01:20:38,877
I just can't do it.

1071
01:20:44,578 --> 01:20:47,799
- Do you have some
magical way to fix it?

1072
01:20:50,976 --> 01:20:54,153
You think I like living
a life like this?

1073
01:20:59,071 --> 01:21:00,943
I'm trying.

1074
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:04,816
Everything I know how
to take away the pain.

1075
01:21:10,953 --> 01:21:12,780
As bad as it sounds,

1076
01:21:15,305 --> 01:21:18,177
I feel better now
that mama's died.

1077
01:21:21,441 --> 01:21:26,882
At least now I can make
myself believe that

1078
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:28,927
Lila's back with family.

1079
01:21:39,677 --> 01:21:45,248
I am drowning in anger.

1080
01:21:48,686 --> 01:21:50,993
My daughter thinks I hate her.

1081
01:21:52,690 --> 01:21:55,562
My son hasn't spoken
to me in days.

1082
01:21:58,957 --> 01:22:00,176
And I don't...

1083
01:22:04,658 --> 01:22:08,749
And I don't even wanna know
what you feel about me.

1084
01:22:11,274 --> 01:22:15,452
There's nothing about a
life like this that I enjoy.

1085
01:22:17,497 --> 01:22:19,108
- Rachel, when's the last time
you got down on your knees

1086
01:22:19,195 --> 01:22:21,980
and practiced what you preached?

1087
01:22:25,375 --> 01:22:27,507
You've always told
everyone else,

1088
01:22:27,594 --> 01:22:30,684
to pray to god in
their darkest hour.

1089
01:22:32,773 --> 01:22:34,906
You are in a pitch black.

1090
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,738
You want to go at it all alone.

1091
01:22:42,348 --> 01:22:45,961
- I guess I've grown
up and realized that

1092
01:22:46,048 --> 01:22:49,703
faith is easier to
preach than to practice.

1093
01:22:51,836 --> 01:22:53,794
- If you say faith was easy,

1094
01:22:55,187 --> 01:22:56,449
it was easy it
wouldn't be the key

1095
01:22:56,536 --> 01:22:58,712
to so many amazing things.

1096
01:23:05,023 --> 01:23:08,418
- I could have all
the faith in the world

1097
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:12,030
and it wouldn't matter.

1098
01:23:14,859 --> 01:23:19,733
No amount of faith is
gonna bring Lila back.

1099
01:23:25,609 --> 01:23:28,438
- You're right it wont.

1100
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,705
She's looking down
at US from heaven

1101
01:23:34,792 --> 01:23:36,141
and she'll be happy
to know that faith

1102
01:23:36,228 --> 01:23:38,187
brought her family back.

1103
01:23:49,328 --> 01:23:52,984
I picture her smiling
down on US every day.

1104
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:06,215
Rachel, magic
doesn't make faith,

1105
01:24:08,130 --> 01:24:09,479
faith makes magic.

1106
01:24:14,919 --> 01:24:18,618
- I could use a little
bit of both right now.

1107
01:24:22,709 --> 01:24:24,320
- We've lost so much.

1108
01:24:29,281 --> 01:24:31,240
I can't lose you too.

1109
01:24:54,132 --> 01:24:56,613
- Sheriff Baxter.
- John Archer?

1110
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:59,616
- Yes sir, this is
my girlfriend price.

1111
01:24:59,703 --> 01:25:01,052
- It's nice to meet you, price.

1112
01:25:01,139 --> 01:25:02,532
This is my grandson, Matt.

1113
01:25:02,619 --> 01:25:04,795
- Good to meet you both.
- Hey Matt.

1114
01:25:04,882 --> 01:25:06,101
Thank you for meeting with me.

1115
01:25:06,188 --> 01:25:07,537
- It's no trouble.

1116
01:25:07,624 --> 01:25:09,278
I'd do anything as a
favor to your grandfather.

1117
01:25:09,365 --> 01:25:10,975
What can I do for you?

1118
01:25:11,062 --> 01:25:12,498
- I'm gonna let you guys talk.

1119
01:25:12,585 --> 01:25:13,238
- Alright.

1120
01:25:14,805 --> 01:25:18,983
Well, there's this prisoner
that's in the county

1121
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:22,160
that I'm looking for some
one on one time with.

1122
01:25:22,247 --> 01:25:24,162
Noah--
- Noah wilcox.

1123
01:25:24,249 --> 01:25:26,817
- Yeah, yeah, how'd you know?

1124
01:25:26,904 --> 01:25:28,035
- That only makes sense.

1125
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:31,169
What do you need from me?

1126
01:25:31,256 --> 01:25:34,085
How can I get
some more time with him?

1127
01:25:34,172 --> 01:25:35,956
I don't know
why you'd want more time.

1128
01:25:36,043 --> 01:25:39,438
- Honestly sir I don't
even know myself.

1129
01:25:39,525 --> 01:25:43,355
I just know it's time my
grandmother wanted me to spend.

1130
01:25:43,442 --> 01:25:46,228
- I'll tell you what,
give me a couple of hours

1131
01:25:46,315 --> 01:25:49,144
and head on over,
I'll get you set up.

1132
01:25:49,231 --> 01:25:51,189
- Really?

1133
01:25:51,276 --> 01:25:53,322
Just like that.
- Just like that.

1134
01:25:53,409 --> 01:25:55,802
- Thank you, sir,
I appreciate it.

1135
01:25:55,889 --> 01:25:58,065
- No problem, tell your
grandfather I said hello.

1136
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:00,198
- I will, thank you, sir.

1137
01:26:07,771 --> 01:26:09,164
Morning.

1138
01:26:10,904 --> 01:26:11,644
- Morning.

1139
01:26:19,391 --> 01:26:22,655
- You guys make a habit
out of watching US sleep?

1140
01:26:22,742 --> 01:26:25,832
- At least not usually
in the same room.

1141
01:26:25,919 --> 01:26:29,271
- I forget they're
not babies anymore.

1142
01:26:29,358 --> 01:26:33,275
- Does this mean you guys
love each other again?

1143
01:26:33,362 --> 01:26:35,451
- Buddy we never stopped
loving each other.

1144
01:26:35,538 --> 01:26:37,714
- Could've fooled US.

1145
01:26:37,801 --> 01:26:40,456
- We were only
fooling ourselves.

1146
01:26:42,632 --> 01:26:44,373
But that's a changin'.

1147
01:26:46,157 --> 01:26:50,596
We haven't been a
family for awhile now

1148
01:26:50,683 --> 01:26:55,297
and it's been my fault
and I'm gonna fix it.

1149
01:26:59,388 --> 01:27:03,348
When you lose something
so close to you,

1150
01:27:03,435 --> 01:27:05,132
it often blocks the
view of the great things

1151
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,699
you still have.

1152
01:27:08,179 --> 01:27:10,050
But only if you let it.

1153
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,966
I'm done lettin' it.

1154
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:19,059
- I'm happy to have
you back, mama.

1155
01:27:19,146 --> 01:27:20,539
- Me too, baby.

1156
01:27:21,627 --> 01:27:22,889
Me too.

1157
01:27:47,174 --> 01:27:50,177
- Do you wanna come in with me?

1158
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:54,399
- No, I think this is something
you need to do on your own.

1159
01:27:54,486 --> 01:27:56,749
- Well at least take
the car, go somewhere.

1160
01:27:56,836 --> 01:27:58,316
- Okay.

1161
01:27:58,403 --> 01:28:00,362
Maybe I'll spend time
with your grandfather.

1162
01:28:00,449 --> 01:28:02,320
- Bet he'd love that.

1163
01:28:03,582 --> 01:28:04,670
Hey...

1164
01:28:07,804 --> 01:28:11,198
Before we're apart again,
I just wanted to tell you

1165
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:12,635
how I feel,

1166
01:28:14,201 --> 01:28:16,421
I love you.

1167
01:28:16,508 --> 01:28:19,381
Whatever has stopped
me from saying that

1168
01:28:19,468 --> 01:28:24,081
until now is absolutely
nothing to do with you.

1169
01:28:24,168 --> 01:28:28,346
It's just stuff that
I've had to work out.

1170
01:28:28,433 --> 01:28:30,305
- I love you too.

1171
01:28:33,351 --> 01:28:36,485
Good luck in there.
- Thanks.

1172
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,458
- You must know someone.

1173
01:28:59,464 --> 01:29:01,205
- She's passed.

1174
01:29:20,746 --> 01:29:24,533
My grandpa would have
something to say here.

1175
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:26,883
The more we talk,
the quieter it gets,

1176
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:28,972
something like that.

1177
01:29:29,059 --> 01:29:31,235
- Sounds like a wise man.

1178
01:29:31,322 --> 01:29:32,497
He is.

1179
01:29:37,502 --> 01:29:39,417
- I'm gonna miss her.

1180
01:29:42,202 --> 01:29:46,293
You know I don't even
remember life before her,

1181
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:51,342
and I think that may have
been her whole purpose.

1182
01:29:51,429 --> 01:29:53,823
- You're a changed man, Noah.

1183
01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:59,481
I didn't see it before
but I see it now.

1184
01:29:59,568 --> 01:30:02,527
I'm glad to
here you say that.

1185
01:30:02,614 --> 01:30:04,529
- Who were you?

1186
01:30:05,530 --> 01:30:06,531
I mean...

1187
01:30:08,141 --> 01:30:13,538
I think in order to find
forgiveness I need to know

1188
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:17,847
why any of this had to
happen in the first place.

1189
01:30:17,934 --> 01:30:18,978
- There's nothing I could say

1190
01:30:19,065 --> 01:30:22,286
to earn your forgiveness, John.

1191
01:30:22,373 --> 01:30:25,420
- You have my forgiveness.

1192
01:30:25,507 --> 01:30:29,336
I'm trying to forgive myself.

1193
01:30:30,990 --> 01:30:33,950
- If you wanna hear the story,
I'll tell you the story.

1194
01:30:34,037 --> 01:30:35,430
Please.

1195
01:30:36,822 --> 01:30:39,434
- Just tell me where to start.

1196
01:30:41,914 --> 01:30:45,483
- Start before it all went down.

1197
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:51,968
- I was a supervisor
at the furniture plant

1198
01:30:52,055 --> 01:30:54,057
out in Richmond.

1199
01:30:54,144 --> 01:30:59,279
I was wealthy by no means,
but you know we got by okay

1200
01:30:59,366 --> 01:31:02,369
and without much stress
to do it.

1201
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:05,851
Then one morning I got up at
5 A.M. like I did everyday,

1202
01:31:05,938 --> 01:31:09,681
drove my truck out to the
plant like I did everyday

1203
01:31:09,768 --> 01:31:14,251
and I scanned my card
key like I did everyday.

1204
01:31:14,338 --> 01:31:17,646
Only this morning, the
door wouldn't open.

1205
01:31:19,822 --> 01:31:22,433
Apparently from some
time between that morning

1206
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:24,304
and when I left
work the day before,

1207
01:31:24,391 --> 01:31:26,698
the plant had closed.

1208
01:31:26,785 --> 01:31:30,659
To this day, I was still
not exactly sure why.

1209
01:31:30,746 --> 01:31:34,010
That led to an immediate
lifestyle downgrade.

1210
01:31:34,097 --> 01:31:38,405
Cars, house, the food
that we ate every night.

1211
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:41,583
The economy was in
the dumps, I mean...

1212
01:31:41,670 --> 01:31:43,498
Jobs were hard to find.

1213
01:31:45,587 --> 01:31:47,806
I did every thing I
could to earn a dollar

1214
01:31:47,893 --> 01:31:49,852
but it was not enough.

1215
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:57,773
The closer I got to failure
to making ends meet,

1216
01:31:57,860 --> 01:32:01,516
the bigger the gap between
Holly and I became.

1217
01:32:03,082 --> 01:32:08,131
But at the end of it, she
hated the sight of me.

1218
01:32:08,218 --> 01:32:10,133
I don't blame her.

1219
01:32:12,657 --> 01:32:16,182
It was my duty to
provide for her and Laney

1220
01:32:16,269 --> 01:32:18,445
and I was coming up short.

1221
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:31,241
I clearly remember the morning
on the day it all happened.

1222
01:32:31,328 --> 01:32:33,809
I was driving a
wrecker truck then.

1223
01:32:33,896 --> 01:32:37,508
Like most mornings, Holly
wasn't really talking to me,

1224
01:32:37,595 --> 01:32:41,164
so I kissed Laney and
I went out the door.

1225
01:32:48,954 --> 01:32:51,217
Towed a car back into
town and soon after that

1226
01:32:51,304 --> 01:32:52,915
my truck broke down.

1227
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:02,098
For that...

1228
01:33:03,447 --> 01:33:04,883
I got fired.

1229
01:33:07,625 --> 01:33:10,628
And that pushed me
right over the edge.

1230
01:33:13,326 --> 01:33:14,632
Something...

1231
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:17,983
Something snapped.

1232
01:33:19,724 --> 01:33:21,683
Looked up and I saw it.

1233
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:25,121
Made a decision.

1234
01:33:26,644 --> 01:33:29,734
For safety reasons,
I always kept a gun

1235
01:33:29,821 --> 01:33:31,997
in the glove compartment.

1236
01:33:32,084 --> 01:33:35,392
I took it and I got
out of the truck

1237
01:33:35,479 --> 01:33:39,918
and then I stopped
and I turned around

1238
01:33:40,005 --> 01:33:43,269
and I emptied the clip, I put
all the bullets on the seat.

1239
01:33:43,356 --> 01:33:46,229
I was just desperate for money.

1240
01:33:46,316 --> 01:33:48,144
Nothing more than that.

1241
01:33:51,234 --> 01:33:54,629
Next thing I know i'm
robbing the place.

1242
01:33:56,761 --> 01:33:59,808
I know it was me standing there.

1243
01:33:59,895 --> 01:34:04,116
It was almost like I was outside
of my body and looking at it.

1244
01:34:04,203 --> 01:34:05,944
And then she walked in.

1245
01:34:20,698 --> 01:34:26,922
I have seen that smile
of hers every day since.

1246
01:34:29,925 --> 01:34:30,621
I mean,

1247
01:34:32,275 --> 01:34:34,233
aside from the fact there
were no bullets in the gun,

1248
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:39,151
I don't even remember
pulling the trigger.

1249
01:34:39,238 --> 01:34:42,938
But apparently there was
a bullet in the chamber

1250
01:34:43,025 --> 01:34:46,158
and apparently I did
pull the trigger.

1251
01:34:49,074 --> 01:34:51,947
The rest is the rest.

1252
01:34:54,514 --> 01:34:57,779
- Why didn't you say
anything in court?

1253
01:34:59,737 --> 01:35:04,916
You stood there and
you said nothing.

1254
01:35:05,003 --> 01:35:06,788
It wouldn't have gotten you off,

1255
01:35:06,875 --> 01:35:09,181
but man it could've helped.

1256
01:35:11,488 --> 01:35:14,056
- How could I do that to Lila?

1257
01:35:15,753 --> 01:35:16,623
Huh?

1258
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:18,582
Whose fault was it?

1259
01:35:18,669 --> 01:35:20,105
Hers?

1260
01:35:21,933 --> 01:35:26,546
It was my fault regardless of
the surrounding circumstances,

1261
01:35:26,633 --> 01:35:33,031
it was me standing there,
it was my gun, my bullet.

1262
01:35:33,118 --> 01:35:35,294
I killed that little girl.

1263
01:35:37,035 --> 01:35:39,734
I didn't deserve
to say anything.

1264
01:35:43,955 --> 01:35:50,135
- I think we use the words
blame and regret too much.

1265
01:35:50,222 --> 01:35:55,967
What we need is
forgiveness, redemption.

1266
01:35:58,404 --> 01:36:02,452
- Starting to sound like
your grandfather now.

1267
01:36:02,539 --> 01:36:05,455
- I just pray that god
will give me the sense

1268
01:36:05,542 --> 01:36:08,588
to take my own advice.

1269
01:36:08,675 --> 01:36:10,547
You'll get it.

1270
01:36:12,027 --> 01:36:16,727
- There is one more
question I have.

1271
01:36:16,814 --> 01:36:20,383
It's actually the only
question I came in here with.

1272
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:21,732
- You wanna know
how the relationship

1273
01:36:21,819 --> 01:36:24,996
between me and
Mrs. Archer began.

1274
01:36:27,782 --> 01:36:29,653
Much like it did with you.

1275
01:36:31,263 --> 01:36:35,224
Complete shock that she
was sitting in front of me.

1276
01:36:38,183 --> 01:36:40,359
- Mr. Wilcox.

1277
01:36:40,446 --> 01:36:43,014
- Why are you here?

1278
01:36:43,101 --> 01:36:45,800
I take
it you know who I am.

1279
01:36:45,887 --> 01:36:49,760
- I do, why are you here?

1280
01:36:49,847 --> 01:36:55,070
Most people would say
because I've lost my mind.

1281
01:36:55,157 --> 01:36:59,291
But I'd like to think I
see hope behind those eyes

1282
01:36:59,378 --> 01:37:01,859
and with a little hope,

1283
01:37:01,946 --> 01:37:05,123
faith can be turned into peace.

1284
01:37:05,210 --> 01:37:07,952
- Why do you want
me to have peace?

1285
01:37:10,433 --> 01:37:12,783
- When we're faced
with tragedies,

1286
01:37:12,870 --> 01:37:15,568
there are obstacles that
stand in the way of faith,

1287
01:37:15,655 --> 01:37:17,875
redemption and forgiveness.

1288
01:37:17,962 --> 01:37:20,530
And when these
obstacles are removed,

1289
01:37:20,617 --> 01:37:24,969
then we can find our
pathway to peace.

1290
01:37:25,056 --> 01:37:26,971
That's when she started
to tell me about something

1291
01:37:27,058 --> 01:37:30,279
called the butterfly diaries.

1292
01:37:30,366 --> 01:37:33,891
From then on, she would
come to visit me every week.

1293
01:37:33,978 --> 01:37:36,807
Sometimes every day.

1294
01:37:36,894 --> 01:37:38,461
She would read from
the Bible to me.

1295
01:37:38,548 --> 01:37:41,246
She would tell me
stories of faith.

1296
01:37:41,333 --> 01:37:43,466
Stories of redemption.

1297
01:37:43,553 --> 01:37:45,424
Stories of forgiveness.

1298
01:37:47,165 --> 01:37:50,212
I never read what she was
writing in those diaries.

1299
01:37:50,299 --> 01:37:53,041
But she kept it
up over the years.

1300
01:37:54,607 --> 01:37:55,782
- Faith...

1301
01:37:57,349 --> 01:37:59,264
Redemption and forgiveness.

1302
01:38:00,962 --> 01:38:04,139
- Yes, she was very clear
it had to be in that order.

1303
01:38:04,226 --> 01:38:06,141
Faith starts it all.

1304
01:38:08,447 --> 01:38:10,710
- You were right all along.

1305
01:38:12,756 --> 01:38:18,022
She changed your life and she
wanted you to change mine.

1306
01:38:18,109 --> 01:38:20,285
- She was very intentional.

1307
01:38:21,808 --> 01:38:25,029
Mrs. Archer knew when
it comes to some people,

1308
01:38:25,116 --> 01:38:27,858
a certain voice
needs to be heard.

1309
01:38:29,816 --> 01:38:31,166
- Thank you.

1310
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:41,872
- Those are two words I
never expected to hear again.

1311
01:38:41,959 --> 01:38:46,137
I didn't expect it but
I was always hopeful.

1312
01:39:20,911 --> 01:39:24,306
- Can I get you to
take a walk with me?

1313
01:39:24,393 --> 01:39:25,394
- Sure.

1314
01:39:25,481 --> 01:39:27,657
Let me grab my jacket.

1315
01:39:31,791 --> 01:39:33,489
- Well you haven't
yelled at me yet.

1316
01:39:33,576 --> 01:39:36,971
I think we should
celebrate that at least.

1317
01:39:38,755 --> 01:39:42,063
You know I thought I
tried everything I could

1318
01:39:42,150 --> 01:39:44,239
to get you to forgive me.

1319
01:39:46,502 --> 01:39:48,678
And--
- John.

1320
01:39:48,765 --> 01:39:51,594
No, let
me finish, please.

1321
01:39:53,074 --> 01:39:55,337
- Okay.
- Please. Umm...

1322
01:39:56,816 --> 01:40:00,037
I went from seeking
your forgiveness

1323
01:40:00,124 --> 01:40:05,086
to being angry at you
for not forgiving me

1324
01:40:05,173 --> 01:40:08,872
yet here we are and...

1325
01:40:08,959 --> 01:40:12,571
For the first time
since that night,

1326
01:40:12,658 --> 01:40:16,488
I can honestly say
I forgive myself.

1327
01:40:19,143 --> 01:40:20,797
And the heartache
that I've caused

1328
01:40:20,884 --> 01:40:23,495
this family is unforgettable.

1329
01:40:23,582 --> 01:40:26,759
But thanks to some good advice,

1330
01:40:26,846 --> 01:40:31,112
I believe that unforgettable
can be forgiven.

1331
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:37,074
Rachel I love you.

1332
01:40:38,815 --> 01:40:43,428
But what I need most right
now is for you to forgive me.

1333
01:40:48,999 --> 01:40:51,001
- I don't think I've
ever spoken words

1334
01:40:51,088 --> 01:40:56,006
that had the potential
to control my happiness

1335
01:40:56,093 --> 01:40:58,487
as much as this.

1336
01:41:02,317 --> 01:41:05,798
I've never spoken words
this big, John boy.

1337
01:41:07,583 --> 01:41:10,064
But I do love you.

1338
01:41:11,848 --> 01:41:14,155
And I forgive you.

1339
01:41:44,185 --> 01:41:46,317
Are you ready, daddy?

1340
01:41:46,404 --> 01:41:48,624
- Reckon I'd better be.

1341
01:41:53,281 --> 01:41:54,673
Where's Laney?

1342
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:56,980
Oh she's
out there with Gabby.

1343
01:41:57,067 --> 01:41:58,242
What's going on?

1344
01:41:58,329 --> 01:41:59,896
- Nothing.

1345
01:41:59,983 --> 01:42:01,811
I just wanted to have
a second to talk to you

1346
01:42:01,898 --> 01:42:03,247
before I brought her back here.

1347
01:42:03,334 --> 01:42:04,814
- Is everything okay?

1348
01:42:04,901 --> 01:42:06,207
- Yeah.

1349
01:42:08,209 --> 01:42:11,168
John Archer came to the house.

1350
01:42:11,255 --> 01:42:15,259
- He did, he must get around.

1351
01:42:15,346 --> 01:42:17,914
And I know he's
been here to see you.

1352
01:42:18,001 --> 01:42:19,307
- He has.

1353
01:42:20,656 --> 01:42:21,352
- Yeah.

1354
01:42:23,049 --> 01:42:26,052
He told me I needed to come
in here with an open mind.

1355
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:29,752
That you're a changed man.

1356
01:42:29,839 --> 01:42:33,756
That you're not the
same man that you were.

1357
01:42:33,843 --> 01:42:35,105
- And?

1358
01:42:37,194 --> 01:42:39,588
- It got me to thinking.

1359
01:42:39,675 --> 01:42:44,027
Signs that you're a new man
have been right in front of me.

1360
01:42:44,114 --> 01:42:46,334
I've just been ignoring them.

1361
01:42:48,771 --> 01:42:50,033
- Why?

1362
01:42:53,254 --> 01:42:58,259
- 'Cause I couldn't
handle forgiving you.

1363
01:42:58,346 --> 01:43:01,479
Seeing you as a monster
trapped behind this glass.

1364
01:43:01,566 --> 01:43:05,918
In some odd way, it
makes my day easier.

1365
01:43:07,485 --> 01:43:09,487
Because if I have to think

1366
01:43:10,967 --> 01:43:13,839
that you're still
the man I married,

1367
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:21,020
how am I supposed to sit at
home everyday without you?

1368
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:30,291
I hesitate to say I love you.

1369
01:43:30,378 --> 01:43:32,380
Not because I don't,

1370
01:43:34,251 --> 01:43:38,342
but because it would be so
much easier if I didn't.

1371
01:43:42,259 --> 01:43:45,175
- The hard truth is

1372
01:43:45,262 --> 01:43:47,873
I may never get
out of this place.

1373
01:43:50,789 --> 01:43:53,052
I can't expect you to sit
around the rest of your life

1374
01:43:53,139 --> 01:43:54,619
out there waiting for me.

1375
01:43:54,706 --> 01:44:00,321
I can't even expect
you to want to love me.

1376
01:44:00,408 --> 01:44:05,761
But to hear you say that you
fight against the need to,

1377
01:44:05,848 --> 01:44:08,416
that's music to my ears.

1378
01:44:10,461 --> 01:44:11,680
- I love you.

1379
01:44:12,898 --> 01:44:14,248
- I love you.

1380
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:40,012
Hi baby.

1381
01:44:40,099 --> 01:44:42,101
- Hi daddy.

1382
01:44:42,188 --> 01:44:44,060
- It's good to see you.

1383
01:44:45,714 --> 01:44:48,412
- I was wondering if maybe
we could do the hand thing

1384
01:44:48,499 --> 01:44:51,763
that you and daddy
did last time.

1385
01:44:51,850 --> 01:44:55,158
- Sounds good to me, Laney?

1386
01:45:18,268 --> 01:45:21,271
Let me help you.

1387
01:45:21,358 --> 01:45:25,188
- I got it, I don't need help.

1388
01:45:25,275 --> 01:45:28,365
- Sure looks like
you do from here.

1389
01:45:28,452 --> 01:45:31,237
Okay enough, let me do it.

1390
01:45:34,066 --> 01:45:37,461
Not every southern man your
age knew how to tie a tie.

1391
01:45:37,548 --> 01:45:39,811
- Hey, I know how to tie a tie.

1392
01:45:39,898 --> 01:45:42,379
- Yeah, yeah, you do, do ya?
- Yeah.

1393
01:45:42,466 --> 01:45:45,556
- Well your suit looks good.
- Thank you.

1394
01:45:45,643 --> 01:45:47,776
The last obstacle
is just getting this thing

1395
01:45:47,863 --> 01:45:50,213
around your neck.

1396
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:52,868
- Wait what?
- What?

1397
01:45:52,955 --> 01:45:54,522
- You just said
my last obstacle.

1398
01:45:54,609 --> 01:45:56,959
Yeah, your tie

1399
01:45:57,046 --> 01:45:59,440
and done.

1400
01:46:01,267 --> 01:46:04,270
- Hey there's
something I need to do.

1401
01:46:04,358 --> 01:46:05,881
I'll be right back, okay?

1402
01:46:05,968 --> 01:46:07,317
- What's going on?

1403
01:46:07,404 --> 01:46:10,189
John we gotta go to
the funeral soon.

1404
01:46:10,276 --> 01:46:11,452
- Here.

1405
01:46:11,539 --> 01:46:13,932
Take my keys head to the chapel

1406
01:46:14,019 --> 01:46:16,021
and let everyone know
I'll be there, okay?

1407
01:46:16,108 --> 01:46:17,545
You want
me to drive you?

1408
01:46:17,632 --> 01:46:21,810
- I've gone two years
without a car, I'll be fine.

1409
01:46:21,897 --> 01:46:23,768
See you soon, okay?

1410
01:47:05,201 --> 01:47:06,420
- Good morning.

1411
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:10,380
The family would like
to thank everyone

1412
01:47:10,467 --> 01:47:12,426
for their attendance.

1413
01:47:17,605 --> 01:47:20,085
I can't stand here

1414
01:47:20,172 --> 01:47:21,783
and claim to know

1415
01:47:22,827 --> 01:47:24,481
what angels are like.

1416
01:47:28,529 --> 01:47:30,487
But I do know this.

1417
01:47:32,533 --> 01:47:35,361
And that is if
they're anything less

1418
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:41,585
than Ms. Carolyn Archer, I
gonna be very disappointed

1419
01:47:46,547 --> 01:47:50,246
it seems as lately every
time I was around Ms. Archer,

1420
01:47:50,333 --> 01:47:52,466
she was singing a song.

1421
01:47:54,642 --> 01:47:57,253
If she wasn't singing this song,

1422
01:48:00,343 --> 01:48:02,476
she was giving me one lyric.

1423
01:48:04,956 --> 01:48:07,698
She was helping me
apply this lyric

1424
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:15,445
to the message that I was to
deliver on sunday mornings.

1425
01:48:18,579 --> 01:48:22,496
It seemed like at those
times she was my pastor.

1426
01:48:24,672 --> 01:48:28,371
Certainly not the
other way around.

1427
01:48:28,458 --> 01:48:31,287
So many times it felt like that.

1428
01:48:38,599 --> 01:48:41,993
I used to tell Ms. Archer
how much it hurt my soul

1429
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:46,215
to stand up here in front of
good folks such as yourself

1430
01:48:48,086 --> 01:48:51,046
and try to think
of something to say

1431
01:48:52,569 --> 01:48:55,529
that could quite
possibly simply stop

1432
01:48:55,616 --> 01:48:57,618
one tear from falling.

1433
01:49:05,190 --> 01:49:10,674
I remember one time as I
was explaining this to her,

1434
01:49:10,761 --> 01:49:13,242
she looked up at me,

1435
01:49:13,329 --> 01:49:14,939
spread her hands out,

1436
01:49:16,593 --> 01:49:18,247
she said, "pastor!"

1437
01:49:19,814 --> 01:49:23,861
We all knew what this
means when she does that.

1438
01:49:23,948 --> 01:49:25,559
She said, "pastor,

1439
01:49:27,648 --> 01:49:31,042
"you can't have a
funeral without the fun."

1440
01:49:33,262 --> 01:49:40,530
Fun, she compared a
funeral to a celebration.

1441
01:49:43,402 --> 01:49:47,972
She looked at me and she
said, "now you go out there,

1442
01:49:48,059 --> 01:49:50,192
"and you tell those people

1443
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:55,153
"how lucky their
loved ones are."

1444
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:56,677
Lucky.

1445
01:49:58,461 --> 01:50:02,596
Lucky because now they're
standing next to the hand

1446
01:50:02,683 --> 01:50:04,119
of our maker.

1447
01:50:05,642 --> 01:50:08,471
In the presence of
our lord and savior

1448
01:50:08,558 --> 01:50:12,040
and how glorious
that it must be.

1449
01:50:13,694 --> 01:50:18,133
So let's put a little
fun into this funeral.

1450
01:50:20,744 --> 01:50:23,225
Let US enjoy this song

1451
01:50:25,401 --> 01:50:27,403
and let US celebrate.

1452
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:31,233
Let US celebrate

1453
01:50:33,583 --> 01:50:35,019
Ms. Carolyn Archer.

1454
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:24,982
- I should go.
- No, she wanted you here.

1455
01:51:58,320 --> 01:51:59,713
- I'm sorry.

1456
01:52:01,323 --> 01:52:04,543
If there was anything I
could do to bring her back,

1457
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:07,677
I would, please believe that.

1458
01:52:10,506 --> 01:52:11,855
Mr. Mills.

1459
01:52:11,942 --> 01:52:14,989
What am
I supposed to say?

1460
01:52:19,950 --> 01:52:22,736
- I know what to say.

1461
01:52:25,347 --> 01:52:30,874
Our mother would be
glad that you are here.

1462
01:52:32,702 --> 01:52:36,619
And I'm glad that you're here.

1463
01:52:43,321 --> 01:52:44,670
- I'm sorry.

1464
01:52:46,324 --> 01:52:47,761
- I know.

1465
01:52:50,807 --> 01:52:52,853
I forgive you.

1466
01:52:53,984 --> 01:52:55,594
And I know...

1467
01:52:57,422 --> 01:53:00,121
I know that our baby
forgives you too.

1468
01:53:51,781 --> 01:53:54,479
- You know Ms.
Archer always said

1469
01:53:54,566 --> 01:53:58,919
that she was waiting
for butterflies.

1470
01:53:59,006 --> 01:54:01,138
I never told her this but
I had absolutely no idea

1471
01:54:01,225 --> 01:54:03,401
what she was talking about

1472
01:54:05,490 --> 01:54:07,101
but now I do.

1473
01:54:09,886 --> 01:54:12,541
It warms my heart to know

1474
01:54:13,977 --> 01:54:16,458
that she's no longer waiting.

1475
01:54:43,572 --> 01:54:46,880
Carolyn Mabel Archer's
favorite scripture was this.

1476
01:54:46,967 --> 01:54:49,099
Do not be conformed
to this world,

1477
01:54:49,186 --> 01:54:52,363
but be transformed by
the renewal of your mind.

1478
01:54:52,450 --> 01:54:55,932
That by testing you may discern
what is the will of god,

1479
01:54:56,019 --> 01:54:59,544
what is good and
acceptable and perfect.

1480
01:54:59,631 --> 01:55:01,285
Romans 12:2.

1481
01:55:06,073 --> 01:55:08,205
It's been said that if
nothing ever changed,

1482
01:55:08,292 --> 01:55:10,773
there would be no butterflies.

1483
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:14,081
I pray that we all have
lives full of butterflies,

1484
01:55:14,168 --> 01:55:16,866
full of change that is met
with our eyes and faith,

1485
01:55:16,953 --> 01:55:19,477
forgiveness and redemption.

1486
01:55:19,564 --> 01:55:22,916
With our eyes on the miracles.

1487
01:55:23,003 --> 01:55:25,875
Not the miracles we
are so sure we need

1488
01:55:25,962 --> 01:55:29,923
or the miracles we are
so sure we deserve,

1489
01:55:30,010 --> 01:55:33,927
but the miracles that like
to show themselves as we are.

1490
01:55:34,014 --> 01:55:35,972
Waiting for butterflies.
