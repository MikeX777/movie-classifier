00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:31,225
WELCOME TO GATLIN

2
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:46,031
Joshua!

3
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:51,995
Joshua!

4
00:03:00,754 --> 00:03:06,218
Jack ... This evening you will come to regret.

5
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:13,016
I'll get you ...!

6
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:37,291
Eli?

7
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:44,756
- He is approaching. He is full, right? - He will beat me again.

8
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:47,801
Not if I can determine.

9
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:51,263
We run away! I will not leave you!

10
00:03:51,471 --> 00:03:53,056
Boy!

11
00:03:53,223 --> 00:03:56,935
I am the only one who can handle him.

12
00:03:57,144 --> 00:04:00,480
Well, please hurry.

13
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:22,669
Why, Dad? Why would you do my brother mischief?

14
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:29,426
The family is holy father. I would never hurt you.

15
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:38,477
- Not even for it here. - It was you who took it!

16
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:52,199
Brat...!

17
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:48,297
Vogt has it here that you watched over me.

18
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:58,182
Eli, you would jo skynde you.

19
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:04,146
Where is he? Come, now, we go. He can do what he wants with me ...

20
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:09,443
- But you he shall not make mischief. - We will stick together. Does not?

21
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:34,343
The boys placed with you for adoption is in order.

22
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:40,098
It may take time for them to get used to the new environment.

23
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:48,148
- The boys have not before ... ... seen the city.

24
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:52,861
- You're nervous, but I know ... - They're here now.

25
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:56,031
I'll get them. Conditions you in peace.

26
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,386
- You are lovely. - Thanks.

27
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:21,348
And you're too young to have a teenage son.

28
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:28,146
- William and Amanda, your new boys. - Hey, Eli. Josh.

29
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,025
Welcome to Chicago.

30
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:58,385
DOOMSDAY IS NEAR

31
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:27,414
We live here.

32
00:08:28,123 --> 00:08:32,336
- Home, lovely home. - Are you ready?

33
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:47,100
Fine. Slightly larger than our camper. They have many fine things, mrs. Porter.

34
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:53,857
Now we go up, I'll show you the room.

35
00:08:59,196 --> 00:09:01,406
Children in the house.

36
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:09,414
This is our room. Need anything, so we just nearby.

37
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:13,043
Knock before you go in.

38
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:20,634
Joshua! Put it down again. It is very, very expensive.

39
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:24,263
- They have a beautiful home, mr. Porter. - Thanks.

40
00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:28,600
It is also your home. You do not say mr. and mrs. Porter.

41
00:09:36,984 --> 00:09:41,113
Josh, you may well not take it up.

42
00:09:41,572 --> 00:09:45,367
Bill, it's just glass.

43
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:50,247
Come, now we eat.

44
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:11,018
- New, Japanese invention: Pizza. - Thanks. Sit down.

45
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:18,984
- Should I help cut it? - Amanda! It takes a while ...

46
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:23,197
... folds it and puts it in his mouth.

47
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:30,871
- grace. - Pardon.

48
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:35,542
Would you say it?

49
00:10:38,295 --> 00:10:44,384
May He who walks behind the rows, protect our crops and provide front

50
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:51,016
- to the disbelief forever be tormented in hell fire.

51
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,352
Amen.

52
00:10:55,312 --> 00:10:59,566
- It was a hefty grace. - Pizza?

53
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:09,785
This is your new farm. "Amanda's garden".

54
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:13,580
- She really green fingers. - Social worker said ...

55
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:19,127
... that cultivated corn here. - Did she? No, no corn.

56
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:26,510
Now I know. I sell corn on the stock exchange.

57
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:36,144
- What's on the other side? - It is an old, disused factory.

58
00:11:39,022 --> 00:11:42,818
But you and Joshua do not play over there.

59
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:48,115
Where is your brother?

60
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:16,018
- She can not take it from me. - Malcolm?

61
00:12:16,977 --> 00:12:19,980
And so here he scores points ...!

62
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:30,282
- Hi! I moved in with a neighbor. - What is this clothing?

63
00:12:30,574 --> 00:12:37,956
- Is that the new Amish fashion? - Why do you cap vice versa?

64
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,585
Joshua?

65
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:48,467
- Come home now. Came. - Thanks.

66
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:09,738
It was supposed to be a surprise.

67
00:13:10,197 --> 00:13:15,661
- Do not go to strangers ... - William?

68
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:23,669
- There were insects in the trunk. - What?

69
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:46,441
Insects, Amanda?

70
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,576
I would take something from home.

71
00:13:57,327 --> 00:13:59,913
It's fine corn.

72
00:14:18,515 --> 00:14:25,898
- I do not think it feels nice. - We should probably just get used to it.

73
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:34,072
Calm. It here arranges himself. Eli is a gem, and Joshua ...

74
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:39,620
... must learn a little more discipline. But you may also.

75
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,589
You do not do anything until we saw the boys again, right?

76
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,260
Quietly.

77
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:12,736
You have probably slept in the same bed for life. We leave them now.

78
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:36,885
I've ruined everything. He was angry with me because I ...

79
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:42,850
... lost glass thing, and afterwards because I was talking with strangers.

80
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:46,854
- We have in any case apart. - Yes.

81
00:15:47,688 --> 00:15:50,232
Good night.

82
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:42,719
I offer it here for him, going behind the rows!

83
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:56,877
David, I deserve the new job. I have two mouths more to feed.

84
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:05,719
- Is that why you wanted to adopt? - Who got Agritect-order? I...

85
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:12,184
- It deserves appreciation. - William, you're too impatient.

86
00:19:12,476 --> 00:19:16,730
Relax, enjoy your new family. The market will not disappear.

87
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:20,943
No, but I do maybe. Remember it.

88
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,822
I must think about it.

89
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:36,625
The here fits just fine. And what about this? Good color.

90
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:39,670
I'll get a pair of scissors.

91
00:19:52,516 --> 00:19:53,684
Now...?

92
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,951
Eli, you forgot your suitcase in ...

93
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:23,088
- I could therefore not like the clothes? - Modest clothing is the best.

94
00:20:23,213 --> 00:20:27,676
It's probably not all children in the school who can afford the kind of clothes.

95
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:31,930
Why should we make them feel inadequate?

96
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:52,993
- Where's the principal's office? - At the bottom left.

97
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,006
- Mrs. Porter?
- Amanda Porter.

98
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:09,510
Father Frank Nolan. I am headmaster here.

99
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:15,766
- It must be your boys. Joshua? - Close. Eli.

100
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:20,354
Lovely shirt. I...

101
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:27,986
I will show you the classroom. This way.

102
00:21:30,447 --> 00:21:33,325
Good morning, class.

103
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:41,291
Joshua, you'll go over in rum 101. That's my class. And Eli ...

104
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:45,504
- Room 112. - Will you separate us?

105
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:50,634
- In going well in different classes. - Father, home ...

106
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:54,596
- I'm used to being together ... - No!

107
00:21:58,308 --> 00:22:03,021
- Do we go out for a moment? - Of course.

108
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:06,149
Excuse us. Remove yourselves from them.

109
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,530
Hey!

110
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,756
- I would not put myself there. - Why not?

111
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,053
Because I think you will try to suck my dick.

112
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:42,769
Have you kolort ears?

113
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:52,988
- Do you feel this? - Your fool. What do you want to do?

114
00:22:53,113 --> 00:22:57,743
- Want to cut in an Amish-young? -, I can cut you, you whore!

115
00:22:57,868 --> 00:23:03,332
She's my sister. I bitches you if you talk like that to her.

116
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,961
- Move! - What's wrong with you?

117
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,839
Nolan will.

118
00:23:15,302 --> 00:23:20,599
Eli, I'm sorry. In can meet in the intervals.

119
00:23:55,342 --> 00:24:01,723
- Why are you leaving yourself up? - Should not it?

120
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:08,063
You really are from the country ... Are you waiting for your brother?

121
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:22,035
What you did this morning was cool, but stupid.

122
00:24:22,411 --> 00:24:27,958
- Put you out with T-Loc. - He should not fall out with Eli.

123
00:24:32,754 --> 00:24:35,507
Do you play well?

124
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:43,348
- "The Mummy"! Let Amish guy to be with. - Why?

125
00:24:43,473 --> 00:24:46,351
Because I say so!

126
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:52,065
- No, Malcolm. He can not play. - Let him be with.

127
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,369
- Can you play? - A little.

128
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:18,967
Little...?

129
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:32,606
We shake hands when you do something good.

130
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:58,799
- Beautiful. - Good fit.

131
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:08,767
I must go.

132
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:24,241
First you will leave me, and then play with them.

133
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:30,664
- I chose not to leave you. - We were never separated, you said.

134
00:26:31,874 --> 00:26:36,336
- We should not. - So do not play with them.

135
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:39,506
I beg you.

136
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:15,709
The wilderness will rejoice, and the desert will bloom.

137
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:21,882
He who walks behind the rows, and we all His children ... are selected.

138
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:28,180
We will bloom on the ground, at home, in klasseværelsernes times ...

139
00:27:28,305 --> 00:27:36,647
... and on the playgrounds. For the unbelievers marks our victory over them.

140
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:43,737
We are the seeds, and now our time has come to grow.

141
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:50,035
If the unbelievers goes over us ...

142
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:55,874
... they will be destroyed.

143
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:03,257
Bless my upcoming fall.

144
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,273
What the heck...?

145
00:28:21,275 --> 00:28:24,069
What's going on?

146
00:29:05,027 --> 00:29:07,196
My goodness ...!

147
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,264
Hallelujah!

148
00:30:21,562 --> 00:30:27,067
- Why do not you listen for? - I will not argue about little corn.

149
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:30,153
If you do not cut them away, so I do.

150
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:32,990
It's his hobby!

151
00:30:41,665 --> 00:30:45,294
This is idiotic. Well.

152
00:30:46,295 --> 00:30:49,923
I look at it tomorrow.

153
00:31:16,283 --> 00:31:18,118
My goodness ...!

154
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:30,839
Hello?

155
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:39,014
Boh!

156
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:43,352
- There frightened I tell you what? - Yes, you did.

157
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:49,149
- Should you reap? - No, but it might well do.

158
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:51,944
- Will you taste? - Yes please.

159
00:31:57,366 --> 00:31:59,868
It smells sweet.

160
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:17,386
- Eli, where does it come here from? - My father. May he rest in peace.

161
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:22,683
He began to cultivate them, and I helped him.

162
00:32:22,891 --> 00:32:26,812
Those here are the only copies. I train with them from Gatlin ...

163
00:32:26,937 --> 00:32:31,400
... that look, they can grow here. - They grow really.

164
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:38,574
It's not even season. Earth is terribly bad.

165
00:32:38,866 --> 00:32:42,828
No stains, no pests.

166
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:47,207
You have grown here in a month.

167
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:53,839
Do you have any idea what this might be worth?

168
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:59,428
My father always said, "You reap what you sow."

169
00:33:25,954 --> 00:33:28,665
It smells good.

170
00:33:44,473 --> 00:33:46,350
Goodbye.

171
00:34:04,785 --> 00:34:08,664
Why are your brother never with us?

172
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,418
Excuse me.

173
00:34:18,966 --> 00:34:21,885
Why did you say that?

174
00:34:22,052 --> 00:34:28,684
- Eli, come and sit with us. - You can sit here.

175
00:34:29,142 --> 00:34:33,438
Or would you rather eat with ... that?

176
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:41,989
"Who" is a friend. It does not hurt to get a little friends.

177
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:48,370
I will maybe also.

178
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:22,464
My sermon today is taken from Genesis 37th

179
00:36:22,756 --> 00:36:28,136
Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers.

180
00:36:28,262 --> 00:36:35,102
They hated him for it. They sold their brother as a slave ...

181
00:36:35,686 --> 00:36:40,065
... and said to his father that he was dead.

182
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:48,115
- Joseph had seen a true vision ... - Joshua? You were right.

183
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:56,248
... will meet with resistance from the ignorant and evil.

184
00:36:56,415 --> 00:37:00,043
- I need to get me friends. - Eli Porter!

185
00:37:06,216 --> 00:37:11,013
- Bored my sermon you? - Yes, Father.

186
00:37:11,972 --> 00:37:19,229
You might want to come forward and share your thoughts with us?

187
00:37:23,025 --> 00:37:25,527
Thank you, Father.

188
00:37:27,654 --> 00:37:32,451
- Who was Joseph? - Who the hell cares ...?

189
00:37:33,327 --> 00:37:42,961
I do. It should ye do. For he was a child, as we are.

190
00:37:43,378 --> 00:37:49,218
A child with a huge worldview. Joseph loved World-

191
00:37:49,343 --> 00:37:54,598
- who gave us food in our stomachs, a roof over our heads ...

192
00:37:54,765 --> 00:38:00,020
... and gave us sea and air. But he predicted the group-

193
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:04,900
- that profane Mother Earth. They poison our food ...

194
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:08,570
... and traps our forest. - Eli?

195
00:38:08,737 --> 00:38:14,201
The plague our air and pollutes our water.

196
00:38:14,535 --> 00:38:17,788
Who was this group?

197
00:38:18,205 --> 00:38:22,876
His brothers. His adult brothers.

198
00:38:24,461 --> 00:38:29,466
Joseph would not let it happen. And you should not either!

199
00:38:29,633 --> 00:38:32,135
Enough is enough!

200
00:38:33,095 --> 00:38:35,764
Enough is enough.

201
00:38:37,057 --> 00:38:40,102
Go into my office. Now!

202
00:38:58,954 --> 00:39:03,834
When you want to ask forgiveness, then I'm in the classroom.

203
00:39:04,877 --> 00:39:11,300
- Could you not like my sermon? - Your words do not interest me.

204
00:39:11,592 --> 00:39:15,345
It is the kind you can take ...!

205
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:28,317
- You did not tell your brother was a priest. - He gets it from his father, he says.

206
00:39:28,442 --> 00:39:33,071
- Your father, you mean? - Nej. His...

207
00:39:33,363 --> 00:39:37,284
Pardon. He's adopted.

208
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:44,541
Mrs. Porter, it's Samantha Gordon. I found an article-

209
00:39:44,666 --> 00:39:50,839
- from Gatlinburg, and this concern really Eli. Will you call me?

210
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,177
Hello?

211
00:40:56,071 --> 00:41:02,161
Damn! Here you pay tax to electricity ...

212
00:41:03,203 --> 00:41:06,915
Aw, shucks. Where did it go?

213
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:11,879
Are you looking for this?

214
00:41:23,056 --> 00:41:28,729
They speak with the Chicago police. Wait here...

215
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:33,650
... so will the infidels quickly be destroyed.

216
00:41:58,634 --> 00:42:02,346
- Have a good day. - Goodbye.

217
00:42:03,263 --> 00:42:08,060
- Do not I get a kys? - Yeah.

218
00:42:13,607 --> 00:42:15,901
Bye mom.

219
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,047
- Mr. Porter, your wife is on the setter. - I'm in a meeting.

220
00:42:37,172 --> 00:42:41,093
- She says it is important. - Tell her I'm out.

221
00:42:41,885 --> 00:42:48,976
Feel sometime. Almost like substance. It is not at all porous.

222
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,119
The shit ...!

223
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:15,627
So I suppose I must do it yourself.

224
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:21,300
Good news. Some of you will be brought up.

225
00:43:21,425 --> 00:43:28,265
Not you, Jenkins. Thee I pulled in for some years.

226
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:32,978
You did not even know the name of America's longest river.

227
00:43:33,437 --> 00:43:39,067
- Where did it come from? - Charles, you know better than that.

228
00:43:40,277 --> 00:43:45,866
Immune against pests and pesticides. Man cultivates the four uger-

229
00:43:45,991 --> 00:43:49,161
- regardless of how the soil looks.

230
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:54,541
You hold a fortune in his hands, Charles.

231
00:43:58,754 --> 00:44:06,303
- Why do you want me with this? - Why mix my company into it?

232
00:44:07,095 --> 00:44:11,767
- Ethically, you are bound to ... - To hell with ethics!

233
00:44:12,434 --> 00:44:17,356
William, this is the first time I hear you curse.

234
00:44:17,814 --> 00:44:21,443
There are only two major mountain ranges in the United States ...

235
00:44:36,834 --> 00:44:38,377
For the heck ...!

236
00:45:10,868 --> 00:45:12,452
William!

237
00:45:13,412 --> 00:45:18,876
I need an investor, but there are others that I can go to.

238
00:45:19,001 --> 00:45:22,087
Do I get a meeting with your board?

239
00:46:08,509 --> 00:46:10,344
Pardon...

240
00:46:12,346 --> 00:46:16,683
- Yes, Eli? - Do I drink some water?

241
00:46:17,726 --> 00:46:19,895
Yes go ahead.

242
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,960
Tak, Frank.

243
00:46:43,585 --> 00:46:48,924
- What a tragedy! - Call if you need anything.

244
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:31,967
Good God.

245
00:48:06,686 --> 00:48:08,854
AUTUMN IS OVER OS

246
00:48:18,864 --> 00:48:20,866
Good morning.

247
00:48:21,033 --> 00:48:23,244
Hello, James.

248
00:48:27,373 --> 00:48:30,960
Hi Jonathan. Danielle.

249
00:48:33,546 --> 00:48:35,089
Gary...

250
00:48:37,591 --> 00:48:39,760
Good morning.

251
00:48:40,928 --> 00:48:48,602
I told Monsignor, that I was glad the English program.

252
00:48:48,894 --> 00:48:54,525
... and let them burn in hell eternal fire.

253
00:48:54,692 --> 00:49:00,031
These deceivers and traitors, they know who they are ...

254
00:49:06,787 --> 00:49:08,789
Excuse me.

255
00:49:10,791 --> 00:49:16,380
Eli up leads it on and a little strange, but I've heard of him ...

256
00:49:16,505 --> 00:49:20,593
- And he says very sensible. - No, Maria.

257
00:49:20,885 --> 00:49:25,389
Stay away from him. You do not know what he is capable.

258
00:49:25,514 --> 00:49:30,644
Josh, what are you talking about? You ... what's wrong?

259
00:49:30,936 --> 00:49:33,522
See it here.

260
00:49:38,527 --> 00:49:41,864
I found it under his bed this morning.

261
00:49:42,073 --> 00:49:43,949
My goodness!

262
00:49:44,158 --> 00:49:49,163
He's your brother, but you should not show it to anyone?

263
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:52,833
- You can show it to Father Nolan. - No.

264
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:55,169
Why not?

265
00:49:55,795 --> 00:50:00,883
- Because we are brothers. - He's adopted.

266
00:50:01,133 --> 00:50:08,307
Eli and I have gone through a lot. We have always looked at each other.

267
00:50:09,141 --> 00:50:13,396
You feel safe with Malcolm, right?

268
00:50:13,562 --> 00:50:15,856
And with me?

269
00:50:31,205 --> 00:50:37,753
- What is it? - I've never done this before.

270
00:50:38,254 --> 00:50:40,840
It's straightforward.

271
00:50:46,595 --> 00:50:48,597
First base.

272
00:50:57,648 --> 00:50:59,525
Second base.

273
00:51:18,919 --> 00:51:23,215
- How to make a homerun? - You do not.

274
00:51:30,723 --> 00:51:35,519
Malcolm, Maria and I are just friends.

275
00:51:35,686 --> 00:51:40,107
She's my sister. Understood? Let me put it like this ...

276
00:51:40,232 --> 00:51:43,903
She should not interfere with a family like yours.

277
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:50,284
- Especially not your crazy brother. - Eli? How regards this him?

278
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:57,333
Do not be silly! Look around. Here should be a lot of people.

279
00:51:57,458 --> 00:52:01,837
Let me ask you something. Who do you think they stay with?

280
00:52:04,423 --> 00:52:09,595
With age comes blindness. But we who are young persons

281
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:17,311
- have a vision of purity. A gift from Him that goes behind the rows.

282
00:52:17,478 --> 00:52:24,694
We must obey Him and rid the world of evil. Our main harvest.

283
00:52:24,902 --> 00:52:27,863
Autumn is here, your clown.

284
00:52:31,575 --> 00:52:37,415
- Halløjsa. - Stop it there bullshit.

285
00:52:37,581 --> 00:52:40,459
I am here to her Dee.

286
00:52:42,628 --> 00:52:46,090
- I can not do without him. - What do you want to do?

287
00:52:47,591 --> 00:52:51,303
- Ecclesiastes me to death. - You can of course try.

288
00:52:52,763 --> 00:52:55,349
Come back, you little shit.

289
00:53:01,147 --> 00:53:05,693
You need to get a decent game beatings.

290
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,531
Where are you, you little fool?

291
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:16,954
- You are here with me now. - No. You are here ... with me.

292
00:53:19,498 --> 00:53:22,293
Before hell! Now you die ...!

293
00:53:26,464 --> 00:53:29,759
Take it away ... take it away!

294
00:53:30,593 --> 00:53:33,262
Help me!

295
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:41,812
I can help you. But the question is whether you will help me.

296
00:53:41,979 --> 00:53:45,691
Yes Yes. Take it away ...!

297
00:53:46,484 --> 00:53:49,195
Let us pray.

298
00:53:50,029 --> 00:53:55,743
I saw an angel come down from heaven, with the key ...

299
00:53:55,868 --> 00:54:02,249
... to the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.

300
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:08,422
This ends my sermon on Revelation.

301
00:54:12,885 --> 00:54:16,639
Is there anyone who has questions ?!

302
00:54:48,337 --> 00:54:55,386
Frank, this is just my opinion. The last weeks we have not had-

303
00:54:55,511 --> 00:55:02,184
- smoking in the toilets, fights, drugs, knives. You must realize the facts.

304
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:06,897
- Finally, we are seeing results. - In terms of what?

305
00:55:07,023 --> 00:55:10,026
Are you blind, Frank?

306
00:55:12,069 --> 00:55:18,659
Noah did not let the world reborn. Had it not been for his children-

307
00:55:18,784 --> 00:55:25,124
- who should fill up all his desires, they had never seen earth decay.

308
00:55:30,504 --> 00:55:33,758
- Hello. - Hi.

309
00:55:33,883 --> 00:55:39,805
- Josh ... I ask forgiveness. - It is not required.

310
00:55:40,056 --> 00:55:45,519
Whatever you are, then you definitely ... not him.

311
00:55:48,689 --> 00:55:54,737
I'm just curious, but what happened to his parents?

312
00:55:55,655 --> 00:56:01,077
- He said they disappeared. - Just like your father, right?

313
00:56:01,243 --> 00:56:06,332
They are like weeds and must be removed.

314
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:19,387
Joshua, you should be in your bed. As late you will not go ...

315
00:56:26,602 --> 00:56:31,607
- Hi. - Hi. You are up late.

316
00:56:31,774 --> 00:56:36,654
- Do you work hard? - I'll make some notes for tomorrow.

317
00:56:36,821 --> 00:56:40,491
Idle hands are the Devil's tools.

318
00:56:40,616 --> 00:56:44,704
It helps me not to think about Amanda.

319
00:56:44,912 --> 00:56:50,668
- Should I talk about my corn in the morning? - Yeah. We can export the ...

320
00:56:50,793 --> 00:56:53,921
... to people throughout the world. - Also for children?

321
00:56:54,046 --> 00:56:56,716
Especially for children.

322
00:56:57,758 --> 00:57:01,637
- Now go to bed. - Good night.

323
00:57:23,784 --> 00:57:27,121
What happened to his parents?

324
00:57:29,415 --> 00:57:32,877
He said they disappeared.

325
00:57:33,044 --> 00:57:36,380
Just like your father, right?

326
00:57:44,597 --> 00:57:49,477
What happened to my father? What did you do to him in Gatlinburg?

327
00:57:49,685 --> 00:57:53,731
I made sure that he could never hurt you.

328
00:57:57,568 --> 00:58:02,573
Face it, brother! I'm the only family you have.

329
00:59:28,826 --> 00:59:31,078
Enough is enough!

330
00:59:31,912 --> 00:59:34,332
I agree with that.

331
00:59:51,682 --> 00:59:54,477
Letter to Amanda Porter.

332
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:02,068
- She's not here. - Will you sign for her?

333
01:00:07,114 --> 01:00:08,824
So.

334
01:00:26,008 --> 01:00:29,512
Malcolm! Wake up.

335
01:00:33,557 --> 01:00:38,187
- What the hell is that? - Let me in.

336
01:00:42,066 --> 01:00:46,028
Josh, if it is not any good murder thee.

337
01:00:46,153 --> 01:00:49,699
It is not good. Take clothes. Come on!

338
01:00:50,616 --> 01:00:56,831
I need your help now to put an end to the madness ...

339
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:02,044
... and evil. Do not fail me now.

340
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:08,217
When I was 14, moved father and I to Gatlinburg. The city was berygtet-

341
01:01:08,342 --> 01:01:12,013
- so it was cheap to buy land. Malcolm, listen for!

342
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:18,102
Land was cheap. Dad had to spend much of its corn experiments.

343
01:01:18,227 --> 01:01:20,146
And it woke me of?

344
01:01:20,354 --> 01:01:27,320
Lord, give me strength to fight this devil ...

345
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:32,241
... with a child's face. He haunts my the dream

346
01:01:32,408 --> 01:01:37,621
- and at school I feel his presence everywhere.

347
01:01:37,747 --> 01:01:39,623
Hey, Frank!

348
01:01:45,921 --> 01:01:51,218
1964? No, it can not be him.

349
01:01:51,344 --> 01:01:56,974
Yes, I can recognize his face. Look at this.

350
01:01:57,141 --> 01:02:03,022
Social Office will check on their orphans.

351
01:02:04,482 --> 01:02:10,404
All rednecks know when it is harvest moon. Have you seen one?

352
01:02:10,571 --> 01:02:14,950
- No. - We have such a one to watch in the night.

353
01:02:15,076 --> 01:02:17,662
Now we must go to Father Nolan.

354
01:02:18,371 --> 01:02:23,501
- Who the hell are you? - You know as well, not, Father?

355
01:02:25,961 --> 01:02:30,966
- Why are we going to Nolan? - I think he understands it.

356
01:02:38,975 --> 01:02:45,773
You knew from the beginning who I was. It knew my foster mother too.

357
01:02:46,315 --> 01:02:51,153
Some people know the kind Frank. I do not know why.

358
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,948
To stop you!

359
01:02:56,242 --> 01:03:02,331
Of course, Frank. You might want to try ad.

360
01:03:06,752 --> 01:03:08,629
Sorry.

361
01:03:15,011 --> 01:03:18,681
- Who are you?! - Let us pray.

362
01:03:43,789 --> 01:03:47,168
- Pray to me, Frank. - No ...!

363
01:03:48,252 --> 01:03:51,797
- Pray to me. - No!

364
01:03:53,924 --> 01:03:55,801
Well...

365
01:04:03,517 --> 01:04:05,603
What do you do?!

366
01:04:06,395 --> 01:04:10,524
You will not get away with it here.

367
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:31,420
- Father? He is not here. - We look after the chapel.

368
01:04:33,047 --> 01:04:38,969
Dear Frank. Thank you lived long enough to-

369
01:04:39,095 --> 01:04:44,016
- to see your work destroyed. Your pupils turned against you.

370
01:04:44,183 --> 01:04:48,938
- I want ... - What? If you want to destroy me?

371
01:04:49,063 --> 01:04:54,318
With this? Your Bible can not do against mine.

372
01:04:54,443 --> 01:05:00,032
- Show it to me, then you should get to see. - Frank, Frank, Frank ...

373
01:05:00,366 --> 01:05:04,787
Do you think I am so stupid that I have it with me?

374
01:05:05,496 --> 01:05:09,125
Why should it be so stupid?

375
01:05:10,751 --> 01:05:11,836
Come ...

376
01:05:12,795 --> 01:05:17,299
Is that where your vulnerability lies?

377
01:05:19,301 --> 01:05:24,307
- I do not have time for this. - That is it...

378
01:05:28,769 --> 01:05:32,106
You can not hide from God!

379
01:05:37,486 --> 01:05:39,155
Fader Nolan!

380
01:05:40,906 --> 01:05:43,951
Father Nolan, are you hurt?

381
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,429
Fader?

382
01:06:06,807 --> 01:06:09,226
Good God!

383
01:06:09,685 --> 01:06:14,607
- Father, what happened? - What the hell is happening?

384
01:06:15,274 --> 01:06:18,402
- Bible ... - What is he saying?

385
01:06:18,569 --> 01:06:21,155
Destroy it.

386
01:06:23,115 --> 01:06:28,913
- What is he talking about ?! - Eli's bible. Back home in Gatlinburg!

387
01:06:47,723 --> 01:06:49,600
Josh?

388
01:06:56,899 --> 01:06:58,734
Hello Maria.

389
01:07:24,427 --> 01:07:28,431
The partnership with Germany is in order. Congratulations.

390
01:07:28,597 --> 01:07:30,891
- We take a drink. - Good idea.

391
01:07:44,697 --> 01:07:47,116
Now we eat dinner.

392
01:07:47,283 --> 01:07:50,036
Your parents are waiting for us.

393
01:08:05,551 --> 01:08:09,847
- This is my home. - That?

394
01:08:14,226 --> 01:08:16,270
Home, lovely home.

395
01:08:45,466 --> 01:08:49,011
I think he laid it at the foot of the scarecrow.

396
01:08:49,178 --> 01:08:55,309
- What Scarecrow? - You go to the right, I left.

397
01:09:04,318 --> 01:09:10,116
Delicious, Eli. It was thoughtful of you to take food with.

398
01:09:10,616 --> 01:09:14,495
- It's my way of saying thank you. - For what?

399
01:09:14,662 --> 01:09:19,417
Maria has not told? Tell, Maria.

400
01:09:20,042 --> 01:09:24,005
- I shall be first. - The first...?

401
01:09:29,093 --> 01:09:31,178
Val, what is it?

402
01:10:00,082 --> 01:10:01,459
A good start.

403
01:10:11,635 --> 01:10:14,180
Do not even thought ...!

404
01:10:38,245 --> 01:10:41,957
Josh, this is green!

405
01:10:57,139 --> 01:10:59,767
You're fired.

406
01:11:13,614 --> 01:11:15,950
Oh God!

407
01:11:18,911 --> 01:11:20,955
Far?

408
01:11:28,421 --> 01:11:30,756
Goddamn...!

409
01:11:33,884 --> 01:11:38,389
Did it? Did you?

410
01:11:40,474 --> 01:11:46,480
Where the hell is the scarecrow? Josh, I slip.

411
01:11:56,615 --> 01:11:59,035
Josh? Nej...!

412
01:12:25,186 --> 01:12:30,733
Do you remember where we put the car? Damn ... the Bible!

413
01:12:31,025 --> 01:12:33,569
I'll get it.

414
01:12:46,832 --> 01:12:48,542
Josh!

415
01:12:51,253 --> 01:12:55,424
Malcolm? What the hell is happening?

416
01:14:13,961 --> 01:14:20,551
This is harvest moon night where the children have to leave their home

417
01:14:20,676 --> 01:14:25,473
- and their worldly property to unite signal

418
01:14:25,598 --> 01:14:32,688
- with Him that goes behind the rows. Tonight we must cleanse the old ...

419
01:14:32,813 --> 01:14:37,109
... cleanse the earth and to harvest clean.

420
01:14:51,707 --> 01:14:56,295
This cross unites you with Him that goes behind the rows.

421
01:14:58,964 --> 01:15:03,010
This cross unites you with Him that goes behind the rows.

422
01:15:10,935 --> 01:15:15,731
Thanks for liftet. I'll see you tomorrow.

423
01:15:19,235 --> 01:15:20,861
Eli?

424
01:15:22,989 --> 01:15:27,743
Let us thank Him that goes behind the rows ...

425
01:15:27,868 --> 01:15:35,543
... for the gifts He has bestowed upon us. Let us ask for strength

426
01:15:35,668 --> 01:15:42,800
- to complete his vision to put an end to all the corrupt.

427
01:15:43,592 --> 01:15:48,597
For us children are the country's purity ...

428
01:15:48,931 --> 01:15:53,686
... and the creatures over 19 years ...

429
01:15:53,936 --> 01:15:55,813
Beast!

430
01:15:58,065 --> 01:16:05,364
Time of change has come. For now, the Beast killed ...

431
01:16:07,742 --> 01:16:10,786
... for the rescue paralyzed.

432
01:16:18,586 --> 01:16:20,463
Eli?

433
01:16:22,631 --> 01:16:26,719
Oh ... Dad came home.

434
01:16:30,765 --> 01:16:34,685
- Sheep. - Eli, what are you doing there?

435
01:16:34,852 --> 01:16:37,521
Who are your friends?

436
01:16:43,569 --> 01:16:48,074
- Eli, what does all of this? - Went meeting well?

437
01:16:48,199 --> 01:16:52,870
- Yes, the meeting went ... - Good. You worked hard.

438
01:16:52,995 --> 01:16:57,583
Thanks to you, our seed spread, our churches will grow ...

439
01:16:57,708 --> 01:17:03,089
... and our harvest will be rich. - Yes Yes.

440
01:17:04,715 --> 01:17:09,679
- Dad, now you need to rest. - No, the night is young ...!

441
01:17:16,686 --> 01:17:18,771
Eli...!

442
01:17:23,526 --> 01:17:26,237
Let our harvests begin.

443
01:17:46,090 --> 01:17:52,179
- I knew you would come, brother. - I'm not your brother!

444
01:17:52,513 --> 01:17:57,184
- I have your weakness, your creeps. - Then destroy it.

445
01:17:57,310 --> 01:18:01,522
I must put an end to you and your Bible simultaneously.

446
01:18:01,647 --> 01:18:06,193
- Then come and get me. - If the Bible was so important ...

447
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:12,616
Why did you leave it so? I have realized that you are like a worm.

448
01:18:12,742 --> 01:18:16,829
To kill one half, then the other live on.

449
01:18:16,954 --> 01:18:22,710
The Bible is your other half, Eli. Now I will crush you completely.

450
01:18:26,756 --> 01:18:30,593
- Give it to me! - Go to hell!

451
01:18:34,972 --> 01:18:39,185
This part of the worm does not like to be harmed, what?

452
01:18:52,281 --> 01:18:59,330
Come on, Eli! Come on, brother. Want your Bible?

453
01:18:59,747 --> 01:19:03,834
I have it here. Come and take it!

454
01:19:13,636 --> 01:19:17,515
Give it to me, brother. Give me the book!

455
01:19:18,557 --> 01:19:21,978
Maria ... He killed Malcolm.

456
01:19:22,603 --> 01:19:27,024
- Now...! - Do you really want it?

457
01:19:32,571 --> 01:19:34,865
Here you go.

458
01:19:52,917 --> 01:19:55,003
Maria?

459
01:20:04,064 --> 01:20:06,941
It's over now.

460
01:21:01,079 --> 01:21:03,373
Help me!

461
01:22:25,471 --> 01:22:27,222
Maria!

462
01:22:29,475 --> 01:22:31,310
No!

463
01:24:00,608 --> 01:24:03,611
We must cut the root of.

464
01:25:02,608 --> 01:25:06,278
- You all right? - Yes.

465
01:26:37,036 --> 01:26:42,374
This is only the beginning. Soon we will sell to the world.
