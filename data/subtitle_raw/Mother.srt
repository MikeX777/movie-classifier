1
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:34,180
FACES OF CHILDREN

2
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:41,640
Saint-Luc,
a village in the Upper Valais.

3
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,640
The mayor's house.

4
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,180
On this spring morning, all those
not kept away by toil have come..

5
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:49,810
Because there is sorrow in the house.

6
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,600
The mayor, Pierre Amsler.

7
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,520
His son, Jean.

8
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:06,430
His daughter, Pierrette.

9
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,270
A neighbor.

10
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,640
The mother of the two children.

11
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,930
Where is Mama?

12
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,520
"She's away on a trip."

13
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,475
"She’s had a shock,
nothing life-threatening.

14
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,560
A few days’ rest and she’ll be
herself again."

15
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:42,970
Canon Taillier, the priest
of Vissoy, was Jean’s godfather.

16
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,225
And for Amsler,
life returned to normal

17
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,680
and he managed
as well as could be expected.

18
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,305
It hurt him to see his children
left on their own,

19
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,060
his home poorly cared for.

20
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:04,640
"And this torn sleeve!"

21
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:50,600
Every night, Jean whispered
a prayer to his mother.

22
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,935
Staring at the portrait as he did,

23
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:22,520
he thought it came to life and
smiled at him.

24
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,270
Like every Sunday.

25
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:25,600
Saint Martin’s day, when the tenant
farmers pay their rent.

26
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,270
Her daughter, Arlette.

27
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:38,850
"I can’t pay."

28
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,345
"The accident that cost
my husband his life

29
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,520
was blamed
on his carelessness."

30
00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:00,805
"So the insurance company, invoking
the regulations,

31
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,180
didn’t pay anything."

32
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,560
And spring returned.

33
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:28,310
Amsler often cut
through Jeanne Dutois’ fields.

34
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,720
The first Sunday in June.

35
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:41,680
"Jean, I have business to see to.
You go alone."

36
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:25,560
"If you agree, we could be married
before Saint John’s Day."

37
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,595
"I’m going to spend a few days
with my old friend, Father Porchet.

38
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,310
How are the children?"

39
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:26,140
"I’m going to remarry."

40
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,935
"The house is empty

41
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,725
and there’s no one
to take care of little Pierrette.

42
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,520
It would be the best thing
for the children."

43
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:32,810
“What about Jean...
Did you tell him?”

44
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,470
“No, not yet.”

45
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,975
“He’s such a sensitive child.

46
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:56,310
I think you’d better
prepare him gently.”

47
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,810
The next day.

48
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:39,520
“You have things to talk about.
I’ll get out of your way.”

49
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,850
“Well?”

50
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,595
“Would you speak to Jean?

51
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,845
I think you’d explain it
better than me.

52
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:08,720
He’s a good boy,
but he’s so sensitive.”

53
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:27,515
“I have an idea! I’ll take Jean
with me to Vissoy for a few weeks.

54
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,770
Then I can gently
break the news to him there.”

55
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,145
“And when he comes home,
things will have returned to normal,

56
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:46,600
and he’ll adapt without too much
trouble to the new situation.”

57
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:03,640
The next day, at dawn,
the priest set off with his godson.

58
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:37,310
Having got through the pass,
they went down into the next valley.

59
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:01,930
By nightfall, they could see
the belltower of Vissoy.

60
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,095
At the end of the hay harvesting,

61
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,390
Saint-Luc celebrated
the marriage of its mayor.

62
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,555
“When you get home,
you’ll find some changes, Jean.

63
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,770
Your father is going to remarry."

64
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,600
“Your duty, my child, is to also
think of your loved ones.”

65
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,935
“Do you want your sister
Pierrette to be brought up badly,

66
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,140
and your papa living sad
and alone for the rest of his life?”

67
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,220
“Do I have to call her Mama, too?”

68
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,350
“Well then... call her mother.”

69
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,640
At the end of the month...

70
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,975
His heart heavy,
but full of good intentions,

71
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,770
Jean set out on the road home.

72
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:22,520
He saw things again
as if he’d been away for years.

73
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:59,055
Before he even crossed the threshold,

74
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,930
the house already seemed different.

75
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,225
“What do I want?

76
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:07,390
I want to get into my own house,
that’s what!”

77
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:20,270
“Mama said I wasn’t
to let anyone in.”

78
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,930
“Sure, but I’m Jean. I live here.”

79
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:11,470
“Who said you could use
my crayons?”

80
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,600
“Mama did.”

81
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:47,555
“Pierrette and I sleep in here.

82
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,020
You sleep in the small room
in the back.”

83
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:51,595
“You have to listen to me,
because I’m your mama now.

84
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,810
Then I’ll love you
and you’ll be my little boy.”

85
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:48,895
“I want you to be cheerful.

86
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,395
I don’t like children who mope
or daydream.

87
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,810
They’re just lazy.”

88
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,020
“Yes, ma’am.”

89
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,600
The snack.

90
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,515
“and you’re not to fight,
or envy one another,

91
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,350
but love and help one another.”

92
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:55,600
The following Sunday.

93
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:36,310
Jean had just noticed
his mother’s brooch.

94
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:10,180
“What’s the matter?”

95
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:14,390
From the first weeks, the animosity
between the children was evident.

96
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:03,095
Pierrette and Jean
always played on “their island”,

97
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:07,890
far from Arlette,
who could not play with them.

98
01:07:55,850 --> 01:08:00,270
“Where is your hat?”

99
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:04,060
One day, they cleaned out the attic.

100
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:36,680
“The material is good. I could make
a dress for each of you out of it.”

101
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:47,180
“It’s not yours. It’s my mama’s.”

102
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:52,060
“Why did you do that?”

103
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:01,390
“Answer me!”

104
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,270
“Will you answer?”

105
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:16,680
“I hate her! I hate her!
I hate her!”

106
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:54,645
"A few months later,

107
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:59,430
Arlette and Jean
had come to hate each other.”

108
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:48,350
“My doll!"

109
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:04,600
“It’s too late to go get it now."

110
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:41,060
That evening, at home.

111
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:29,890
“It’s silly to cry over a lost doll
at your age.”

112
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:42,720
“Go upstairs.
I’ll be up in a moment.”

113
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:54,560
“I’m sure your doll
fell near the bridge.”

114
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:23,680
“It’s not far. Go on.
I’ll open the door for you.”

115
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:28,600
Jean had merely hoped that Arlette
would get a scolding.

116
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:49,390
He began to understand
the seriousness of what he had done.

117
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:37,640
Lost.

118
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:17,140
“Did you hear the avalanche?”

119
01:30:26,810 --> 01:30:30,180
The only solution: to admit
everything right away.

120
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:36,850
"What's wrong?"

121
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:52,310
“I only want to speak to Papa.”

122
01:39:10,270 --> 01:39:11,680
"Go and pray.”

123
01:39:25,310 --> 01:39:27,345
Full of shame and anxiousness,

124
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:30,100
he turned to his mother’s portrait...

125
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:43,850
but the image seemed distant and faded.

126
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:15,310
Even the portrait had abandoned him.

127
01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:32,180
The next morning.

128
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:10,060
His father hadn’t made
the slightest reproach.

129
01:47:50,930 --> 01:47:55,515
Jean thought he had become
an object of horror to his family.

130
01:47:55,640 --> 01:47:58,520
He felt like a criminal.

131
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:43,305
Dear Papa,

132
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:48,470
Goodbye. I’m a wretch.
I hope you will forgive me.

133
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:51,560
Love, Jean.

134
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:34,970
“I’m going away forever.

135
01:49:50,470 --> 01:49:55,640
“Since you forgive me Arlette,
will you give me a kiss?”

136
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:16,220
"I leave this letter to father."

137
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:53,310
"then he left for the torrent."

138
01:55:50,600 --> 01:55:52,890
"Mama."

139
01:56:12,770 --> 01:56:15,180
THE END
