00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,872
THE DOG TRICK

2
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,836
Simon here.

3
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,518
Oh, is that the time?

4
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,556
I'm on my way. I'm just going
to watch... I mean, get dressed.

5
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,995
I've just had a shower.

6
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,079
But I am coming!
Right. See you.

7
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,231
Wrtten and directed by
Christian Eklöw & Christopher Panov

8
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,153
Why can't he let it go...

9
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,118
But maybe they'll recognize him.

10
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,159
Recognize who?
It's been about five years!

11
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,277
- Two years.
- OK. Two years since he was in...

12
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,353
Robinson Survivors.
It's me - Survivor-Micke.

13
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,638
- Hey... I'm a star.
- I haven't got time.

14
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,758
I realize this is
a stressed scene for you...

15
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,233
A couple of friends from out of town,
who haven't done Stockholm...

16
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,835
Famous or not,
everyone queues here.

17
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,512
Go to the back.

18
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,354
- But...
- To the back! Now!

19
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,271
Did it do the trick?

20
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,273
No. It makes no odds, famous or not.
Everyone has to queue.

21
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,669
No shit!

22
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,877
- How's things?
- Great.

23
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,272
- Lot of people this evening...
- Shit!

24
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,711
I thought he'd broken my neck.

25
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,360
The frigging idiot!

26
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,477
- When you called him 'Belgian Blue?'
- Whose side are you on?

27
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,508
- Simon, you're on my side, eh?
- Well, I feel...

28
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,989
See? Simon's on my side.

29
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,192
Mario here.

30
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,713
Hi, sweetheart.

31
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,476
I'm at some dump
with Simon and Robinson-Micke.

32
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,754
Love you too. Kisses. Bye.

33
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,312
How long have you two
been going steady?

34
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,391
- Three years.
- Three?

35
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,033
Bloody hell.

36
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,795
- Still in love?
- You bet we are.

37
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,356
Hey, Mario.
Same chick for three years.

38
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,352
- Problems?
- Not that again!

39
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,273
Simon, come by work tomorrow.
I'll buy you lunch.

40
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,796
- Bye. Say hi to Sanna.
- See you, Micke!

41
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,515
Right, Mum's gone.
Now for some booze.

42
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,797
- I'm tired...
- One more beer, Simon.

43
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,118
Simon here.

44
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,393
What d'you fucking think!
I'm getting the beers.

45
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,993
Four?

46
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,751
You're insane!

47
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,877
I'm nearly unbeatable at survival.

48
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,192
- How long since Big Brother?
- You mean Survivor. Since Survivor.

49
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,270
- It wasn't kid's stuff like Brother is.
- I meant Survivor.

50
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,359
A year or two back.

51
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,116
- Were you in the papers?
- Quite a bit, for a while.

52
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,553
Were you?

53
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,950
As a star
you've got to watch your intrepidy.

54
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,875
Too much media
can make you a 2nd class star.

55
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,520
You've got to stay on top...

56
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,353
...if you see what I mean.
- Yes!

57
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,638
- Can we see your Survivor tapes?
- Watch some?

58
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,678
Of course you can watch Survivor!

59
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,550
Micke, please. We've seen it
so many times. Not again.

60
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,429
Well... no.

61
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,108
Forget it, then.

62
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,915
It tickled...

63
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,309
I'd better leave. I've got
to go to workin the morning.

64
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,479
- I enjoyed meeting you.
- Yeah, me too.

65
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,357
Bye, then...

66
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,998
Bye, Emma.

67
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,191
Listen...

68
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,477
lf you want to watch it
I can put it on.

69
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,950
- If you want to.
- I couldn't give a damn.

70
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,192
But if you want to...
No. Okay.

71
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,474
- Simon! Was it you?
- Eh?

72
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,233
- Must you?!
- Ooh, Roblnson!

73
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,118
Just a quickl ook, then.

74
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,751
- Right, I'm off out. Have a good time.
- Thanks. See you.

75
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,671
Welcome to the first new episode
of Survivor.

76
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,910
You viewers will know...

77
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,673
He's absolutely gorgeous.

78
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,989
I mean, he's much better
than the new guy.

79
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,278
- I'll tell you something about him...
- That's you!

80
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,710
You bet.

81
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,360
So you're rearing to go.

82
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,955
And your single possession is:
A condom.

83
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,837
So cool!

84
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,311
But if you want to roll round
in the sand more than once?

85
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,675
Easy-I'll recycle it!

86
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,915
"Recycle! Recycle..."

87
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,233
Did you see that? Oy!

88
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,712
Jesus!

89
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,828
...a winner. In this year's
Survivor series there's a new game...

90
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,639
lf it hadn't been for that bastard...

91
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,476
Let's say it's gonna be muddy.

92
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,672
- Watch Sports Newslastnight?
- No... I was out.

93
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,995
Hammarby could well move up.

94
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,789
- I'll be getting tickets.
- That won't be easy.

95
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,475
But you can always get hold of some.

96
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,838
So Micke got the usual going
after the party, did he?

97
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,319
Yeah.

98
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,628
A bit of heavy kissing?

99
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,993
Yeah.

100
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,634
Rather, not me.
But Micke got the heavies.

101
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,757
The chick Iw as with
was a bit... shy.

102
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,149
She was shy?

103
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,517
Well, it was me that was.
Christ, you know what I'm like!

104
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,878
- I'm like a...
- You needn't get angry with me!

105
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,474
Honestly, Simon...

106
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:54,398
...Iove- "the Hollywood life," as
you call it- can't be found in a bar.

107
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,155
You're hardly going to find someone
any old how.

108
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,518
But you don't have to go chasing
disco chicks with Micke.

109
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,356
I'm sick of being single.
I want to meet someone, fall in love.

110
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,719
Sooner or later you'Il find someone.

111
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,395
Look at me.
The local grocery, three years ago.

112
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,869
- You forgot your ketchup.
- And?

113
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,599
Otherwise
you'd never have met Sanna.

114
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,595
- Coincidence... It happens.
- But all this waiting!

115
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,792
Did he put Survivor on?

116
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,437
Staff to dell counter, please...

117
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,715
Hi.

118
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,155
- Hi there!
- Hi.

119
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,552
I've only got a little ketchup
and stuff. Could I go first?

120
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,393
- Go ahead.
- Really kind of you.

121
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,389
I... think I forgot my ketchup.
Have you taken it?

122
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,549
Eh?

123
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,110
- My ketchup, you haven't got it?
- Ask him.

124
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,111
Hey, your ketchup!

125
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,670
- In your bag maybe?
- It's at the check-out!

126
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,799
When were you last
really in love with someone?

127
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,393
Let me tell you about "love."

128
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,076
Chicks... they can fall in love.
But guys can't.

129
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,278
Lay off.
I really want to fall in love.

130
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,751
I've never had a real relationship.

131
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:24,756
I want someone to share everything
with, all the fun, all the rough going.

132
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,197
- Just like Mario.
- It's an illusion.

133
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,673
You were in love with Bella.
You and Mario know what love is...

134
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,752
I wasn't in love with her. I wasn't!

135
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,154
I was too young to know any better.

136
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,800
- Sure...
- Today I know better.

137
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,394
We both know it's just not true.

138
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,155
You just say that
because you got so dumped!

139
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,437
Look at me, how I'm hung!

140
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,753
I can have any girl I want.
It was a stupid teenage love affair!

141
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:04,278
You were stunned for two years
by a "stupid teenage love affair."

142
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,474
Know what your problem is?

143
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,279
You're in love with love.

144
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,833
- See?
- At least I'm in love with something.

145
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,993
- Yippee!
- Good. That takes care of that.

146
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,914
- Let me thrash you at Tekken.
- I've gotto go...

147
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,629
- I've got a French lecture at 8 a.m.
- Shit...

148
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,838
- Could you lend me my bus fare?
- In my jacket.

149
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,151
- Thanks for the pizza.
- Okay. See you.

150
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,632
- Teenage love affair...
- Have you found my wallet?

151
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,795
Thanks. See you.

152
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,998
Oh, shit! Hi there, Micke!

153
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,120
- You're upset...
- I'm sorry!

154
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,637
...but this isn't what you think.
- Shut up, Pontus!

155
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,119
Micke...

156
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,679
Let's get started:

157
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:32,029
Sweden v. Yugoslavia. You're
gonna get good 'n'thrashed, Mario!

158
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,113
- Remember last time?
- I've deleted that from my memory!

159
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,599
- Hiya.
- Hiya.

160
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,757
- Have you already started?
- No.

161
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,472
- You're Brazil?
- Of course.

162
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,308
Why are your pants down?

163
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,472
- Ask Mario.
- Get your pants off!

164
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,791
- Sorry?
- Did you come on the Tube?

165
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,440
- Yes?
- Get your pants off, then!

166
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,112
What d'you mean?

167
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,273
How many junkies used your seat
before you did?

168
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,559
The filth they leave
gets sucked up into your pants...

169
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,111
- "Sucked up!"
- And then dumped in my new sofa.

170
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,191
Get'em off!

171
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,796
- I'm serious. Get them off!
- You're sick. You need help.

172
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,236
- Please remove your pants!
- No.

173
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,198
- Let's skip the rest.
- It's the final...

174
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,795
Let's go out and have a beer
and then see.

175
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,589
I said I was going to rent a video.
Lay off.

176
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,309
- Simon... Sippy?
- Quit it.

177
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,391
- One beer!
- Quit it!

178
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,835
Fuck! What is it?! No,
I'm not coming. I've got reading to do.

179
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,718
- Goal!
- Re-run! That wasn't fair!

180
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,715
- You needn't get so worked up.
- Don't interrupt, then!

181
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,076
I won't bother talking
to you again, then, ever.

182
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,910
- Hi, guys!
- Hi, Sanna.

183
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,878
- Hello.
- Hello, sweetheart.

184
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,951
- Hi, Simon.
- Mmm.

185
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,990
- What's the score?
- It'll soon be 6-0.

186
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,676
- And... Are you watching? There!
- For Christ's goddam sake!

187
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,991
So frigging bad.

188
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,110
That's enough humiliation for one day.
- Hi, Sanna! - I'm off home.

189
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,111
See you tomorrow.

190
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,953
- Hungry, sweetheart?
- Abit. Shall we make some food?

191
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,349
- How about you?
- No thanks.

192
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,229
Erik Jansson?

193
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,869
- Here.
- That's you then, loud and clear.

194
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,509
Giorgos Astrapopolis?

195
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,398
There!
Dad's a cop, is he?

196
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,879
I mean 'police'-
'Astropo-police'...

197
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,315
Emma Larsson.

198
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,790
- Emma Larsson?
- Here I am.

199
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,431
Simon Svensson.

200
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,629
Simon Svensson?

201
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,070
No? Svensson's a deserter.

202
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,833
- Cross him out, then.
- Here!

203
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,276
You didn't hear me
call your name twice?

204
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,920
- But...
- Or at least once?

205
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,992
Perhaps you think I mumble.

206
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,995
Perhaps all the others
just guessed I'd said their names.

207
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,354
I doubt it.

208
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:57,399
D-a-n-i-e-l K-a-r-l-s-s-o-n.
K A R L S S O N.

209
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,518
Hi, Micke. It's Simon.

210
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,071
Guess who's at my French course.

211
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,189
Emma!

212
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,952
No kidding!

213
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,631
So what happened?

214
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,989
- Micke.
- Unbelievable!

215
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,755
Micke, lend a frigging hand!

216
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,277
I've gotto go.

217
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,399
Mario called.
We're playing a TV-game at eight.

218
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,630
- Okay?
- Micke! Shit!

219
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,312
See you.

220
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,593
- You can certainly talk on the phone.
- I'm sorry...

221
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,513
...that mymum's in emergency.

222
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,593
Forgive me, if I'm a bit worried
about her health.

223
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,189
Hi.

224
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,874
I feel so frigging afwul.

225
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,678
What's happened?

226
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,275
- I've got such a hell of a problem.
- Come in...

227
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,151
I'd rather stay put. Such a terrible
problem because I can't...

228
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,917
...make my mind up as to which
of these wonderful girls I want.

229
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,030
- Feel at home.
- No, Micke...

230
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,714
Don't spoil it all now.

231
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,270
The redhead's got
a wicked crush on you.

232
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,838
Got any beers?

233
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,754
Little sis been watching
a tear jerker?

234
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,036
Go easy on Simon.
He's never been in love-

235
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,192
- so he escapes
into Hollywood movies.

236
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,909
- No picture in my wallet...
- Don't mumble!

237
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,994
At least I don't have a picture
of my only, old love in my wallet.

238
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,678
Have you been snooping in my wallet?
Shit-face.

239
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,396
You call... just to hear her
on the answering machine...

240
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,395
He got out of bed on the wrong side.
We're off. The party's over.

241
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,838
I'm sick of you always moaning.

242
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,834
- Always?
- Yes, always.

243
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,755
Always belly aching: "Look at Mario...
I wantto be really in love."

244
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,990
Snap out of it!

245
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:46,278
How can you meet a girl if you're
home watching Pretty Woman?

246
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,309
Right, girls! We're off.

247
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,669
- Simon. I've got this great thing.
- What thing?

248
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,796
I'm talking to Simon.

249
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,959
Simon!

250
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,872
- Don't walk across...!
- I'm only going to say it once.

251
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,871
- Say it, then!
- Right!

252
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,429
This friend of mine
has had a girl problem like yours.

253
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:27,310
But now he's got so many girls,
he can't make his mind up.

254
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,951
- Do you know why?
- Please. I'm bursting to know.

255
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,591
- Okay... The dogtrick.
- What?

256
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,478
The dogtrick:
Buy a nice pup.

257
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:45,032
Walk it in the park and the girls'll
all be hanging round your neck.

258
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,032
You mean he's got to buy a dog?

259
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,830
Or borrow a damn dog.
Who cares whose the thing is.

260
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,315
It's fresh, solid girls - none of your
disco chick types.

261
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,153
And how would you know,
Mr. Expert?

262
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,236
Dogs bring out the mother in women.
They see you patting the dog-

263
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,791
- and think: "He'll be sweet
to our children, too, if we have any."

264
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,839
You really believe it works?
It's absolutely nuts.

265
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,436
I don't care.
It says so in 'IIlusionated Science.'

266
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,149
Professors have written articles
and proved it.

267
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,672
- And it worked for your mate?
- His wedding's in a month.

268
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:33,038
- Oh, that guy with all the girls?
- No. That was Jonas.

269
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,910
- Has it worked for lots of people?
- For everyone! It can't fail.

270
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,551
- Even for you, Simon.
- Why not try it yourself, then?

271
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,996
You know I don't want
the cozy suburban life.

272
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,390
- Right.
- I pick up chicks at bars instead.

273
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,312
Gotcha!

274
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,428
Luck.

275
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,831
Hey... Sanna's sister's just got a dog.

276
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,120
- You are kidding, aren't you?
- Of course I'm kidding.

277
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,108
- What a lovely little dog!
- Isn't it.

278
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,795
- And where are you going?
- To the vet.

279
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,757
Is he not well?

280
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,196
He's going to be run down...
I mean put down.

281
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,271
Oh! Whatever for?

282
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:54,555
He's a schizophrenic. He thinks he's
a cat, scratches and meaows. Listen!

283
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,272
- Poor thing!
- It's terrible.

284
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,390
- Oh, no! He's having one of his fits.
- Get him away from me!

285
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,315
Run for it! Or he'll bite you!
He's attacking! Run, lady!

286
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,035
Let's go.

287
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,039
- Sorry!
- It's quite all right.

288
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,955
- What a sweet dog!
- Dachshund. It's a dachshund.

289
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,713
Hi. - What it's name?

290
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,472
Fido.

291
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,152
- He seems to like you.
- Yes...

292
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,318
- Love at first sight.
- Yes. Really.

293
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,677
I'm Simon.

294
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,640
Hi. Maria..."Mia."

295
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,957
- Are you going that way?
- What? Yes! I am.

296
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,033
Good. We can walk together.

297
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,996
- Do you live round here?
- No...

298
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,675
Well, yes... not too far off.

299
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,956
- How old's...
- 25.

300
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,474
I meant the dog.

301
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,680
- Oh... er... It's 25 - dog years.
- The same as you, then.

302
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,393
Yes. Same as me!

303
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,953
Unbelievable! Everything was great
between us- it all came together.

304
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:29,034
- Okay! Didn't think it'd work, Micke.
- My ideas always do.

305
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,318
- When's your next date, then?
- Dunno. I can't call her.

306
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,833
- Don't you dare?
- No. I mean yes...

307
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,639
We never swapped phone numbers.

308
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,158
- What did you say?
- It's so stupid...

309
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,913
...we talked for hours and then...

310
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,472
You meet your dream girl and
you don't swap numbers! You're nuts!

311
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:03,272
I come along, I put the ball
on the spot and Itie your boot laces-

312
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,319
- but how do you thank me?
By shooting over the bar!

313
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:14,078
- You're worse than the Yellows!
- Oh thanks. I feel much better now!

314
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,633
Worse than the Yellows
Worse than the Black 'n' Yellows

315
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,349
Mia.

316
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,749
Mia... Wait!

317
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,430
Hell! Mia, wait!

318
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,320
Get a move on!

319
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,109
- To Odenplan...
- No pets.

320
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,314
- He's ill. We're in a hurry!
- No pets in the cab.

321
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,391
Wait!
- Come on!

322
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,599
Wait there. Don't go away.

323
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,198
- Drive towards Odenplan. Hurry!
- What address?

324
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:50,437
Listen... that bus has got
the girl of my dreams in it. Okay?

325
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,433
I might never see her again.
So, foot down!

326
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,318
Just like in the movies!

327
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:03,157
Right, we'll tail them like Miami Vice.
I'm Tubbs and you're Crocket.

328
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,639
Great!

329
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,198
Look at this, my friend.

330
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,796
- Beautiful, isn't she!
- Yes, she is.

331
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,959
But she's gone, for good.

332
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,072
- I'm sorry.
- I'll never forgive myself, myfriend.

333
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,873
- Oy!
- It's a crosswalk!

334
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,951
Just drive, please!

335
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,592
My friend's beloved is in that bus.
Thanks for ruining his life!

336
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,671
Thanks a lot!

337
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,029
People have no respect for love
anymore. No respect!

338
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,750
The bus. See it? There!

339
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,318
Letme off here and I'll run.

340
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,111
- Is 100 enough?
- No problem.

341
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,838
Thanks, Tubbs!

342
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,991
What the...!

343
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,239
Shit-the dog!

344
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:44,674
The French verb
can be compared with to have.

345
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,958
It's conjugation stems
from the basic form: Avolr.

346
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,832
- Sorry...
- Beg pardon?

347
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,799
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Late? Really?

348
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,190
Perhaps this lot
were 15 minutes early.

349
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,035
Turn that cellphone off!
Or is it my head buzzing?

350
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,272
Where was I?
The basic verb form is av...

351
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,756
Sorry I'm late.

352
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,992
Not to worry.
Would you step forward here, please.

353
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,435
Come on... up front!

354
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,713
- Hi.
- Hello.

355
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,234
- I'm Roffe.
- Mia.

356
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:35,236
Could you help me read this, loud
and clear for all your mates here?

357
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,871
- Shall I...
- Read it!

358
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,870
'The basic verb form is... '

359
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,552
'... avolr.'

360
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,392
Just read it.

361
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,195
- Don't let me bother you. Just read.
- I can't...

362
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:04,355
Read louder and clearer
so all your friends can hear you!

363
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,479
- Hard going, was it?
- Yes.

364
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,154
Get the gist?

365
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,268
Be on time in future. Sit
where you want, I'm feeling generous.

366
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,637
For Christ's sake!

367
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,234
Hey, you!
Come here a sec!

368
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,319
It's really weird,
our doing the French course.

369
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,995
I started late. I was fifth reserve...

370
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,519
Why are you doing French?

371
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,991
- I worked in Paris for six months.
- I see.

372
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,709
Then you must be fluent.

373
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,156
Afraid not!
You forget it very quickly.

374
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,110
- There's a soccer game this evening.
- What?

375
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,875
I've got an extra ticket...
if you'd like to come.

376
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:08,636
I'd love to. How did you get tickets?
They sold out days ago.

377
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,555
- Contacts.
- Okay. Yes, I'd love to.

378
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:18,555
- 6 p.m. At the south gate?
- Right. Great. See you there.

379
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,631
- Great. Bye.
- Bye.

380
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,999
Thank you.

381
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:27,198
- Hi. Two for the game, please.
- Sorry. Sold out.

382
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,556
- Eh?
- That guy bought the last ones.

383
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,599
Oh, shit!

384
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,309
Hey, you! You've got to letme
buy your tickets...

385
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,154
- Never. Never, mate!
- Hang on...

386
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,190
...I mean it, I'll give you 500.
- No. I've been waiting for this game.

387
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,274
A thousand-two for a thousand.
Help me out! Please!

388
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,759
1,500.

389
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,115
- 1,500?
- Yes.

390
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,671
- It's a deal. Okay?
- Each!

391
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,795
Three thousand for a soccer game.
You're nuts.

392
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,678
But I told her I had tickets.

393
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,673
- Shit, it's too small, isn'tit?
- Tight's cool.

394
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,557
But I don't look...

395
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,150
...I don't look faggy, do I?

396
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,554
- Well, yes, actually.
- The scarfll have to do, then.

397
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,996
I was joking. You look great.

398
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:37,837
- No kidding?
- No. Girls like the feminine touch.

399
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,992
Very funny.
Let's get going, then.

400
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,395
Won't you need these?

401
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,115
- Hi. Sorry. Have you been here long?
- No. I've just got here.

402
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,189
- Hi!
- Hi!

403
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,636
- Big crowd.
- Yes, but then it's...

404
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,157
Two Stockholm clubs, yes.
But in any case it'll be... fun.

405
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,911
Cool T-shirt.

406
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,399
So's yours!

407
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,110
Shall we... get in the queue?

408
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,236
Yes, why not?

409
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,838
35 D. Still with me?

410
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,035
Over here!

411
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,917
- Great position!
- Are you're sure this is right?

412
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,355
- Are you sure it's right?
- Yes. 35...

413
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,039
...D.

414
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,438
YELLOWS!

415
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,158
YELLOWS!

416
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,758
YELLOWS!

417
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,072
Filth ytackle! Warn 'im!

418
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,631
Christ, how cool!

419
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,870
Christ, howcool! Great!

420
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,439
- Where's Simon?
- Not coming.

421
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,794
- Not coming?
- Doing something with Mia.

422
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,833
- But Wednesday's always boules!
- He's in love.

423
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,878
Leave him be.
You know what it's like.

424
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,955
- I'm not playing with him again.
- Lay off! Let's get going.

425
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,110
Don't be so grumpy.

426
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,473
What's the one with... Debra Winger?

427
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,472
- An Offlcer and a Gentleman.
- Isn't it great?

428
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:37,078
Wicked! The last scene's brilliant,
everyone doing a standing ovation.

429
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:41,233
- So wicked!
- A pity it only happens in films.

430
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,514
Yes.

431
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,515
- Don't say you like that film, too!
- A real favorite...

432
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,592
- You can't mean it!
- It's true.

433
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,952
So beautiful...

434
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,750
...with Julia Roberts in the car,
crying, looking out of the window!

435
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,709
And they play 'It MustHave Been
Love'- Roxette. It's so beautiful.

436
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,836
It's so sad...

437
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,275
Though you know from the start
it'll end okay.

438
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,670
- And yet you cry.
- Yes, each time you see it.

439
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,916
I always think the last scene's
when they aren't going to meet...

440
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,354
...but then the real end comes.
- Richard in his white limo...

441
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,911
...with a bouquet.
- Her knight on a white horse...

442
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,152
...that she's dreamt about all her life.
So beautiful.

443
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,312
Go for it!

444
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,759
Are you trying to kill me?

445
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,233
- 40- love. Match point.
- It was out!

446
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,470
- What?
- It was In, partner.

447
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,839
Shit, it was about six inches out.

448
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,879
- You can still see the mark...
- We're 5- 0 down.

449
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,793
Does it matter?
Just play!

450
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:48,508
If they want to win by cheating,
that's cool. Great fun.

451
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:53,594
- Leave it now! We're winning!
- Can we play? It's getting cold.

452
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,432
40- love. Match point.

453
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,469
Yes, match point.

454
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,676
Bloody cheat.

455
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,909
Come on, Mario! Think "love all."
This is our point. No problem.

456
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,835
Shit!

457
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,552
- Cool down!
- She fucking aimed atme!

458
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,631
- Bloody unsportsman like!
- Thanks for a very exciting match!

459
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,792
It was an unbellevably fun
game of tennis.

460
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,512
Thanks a lot.

461
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,398
- He's so...
- Why can'the...?

462
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,392
Sorry we're late. Micke's hair needs...

463
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,471
Hiya, Sanna...!

464
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,558
- Hiya.
- Hi.

465
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,389
- Want a ride?
- You bet.

466
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,472
- We're going out tonight. Okay?
- Eh?

467
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,437
No... No, I can't.

468
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,478
We agreed to.

469
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:07,519
I know, but I've got things to do.
Study and stuff.

470
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,719
Forget it.

471
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,358
Want a ride to the Tube?

472
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,989
- No...
- Walk? -We'll walk.

473
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,116
Thanks anyway.

474
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,716
- What's the problem? Let's go!
- Get going. We'll walk.

475
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,279
- Bye.
- Bye.

476
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,352
- Nice to meet you, Mia.
- Same here.

477
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,712
Mia here.

478
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,633
My mum.

479
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:08,111
No, he's still believes it all.
Why, has he said something to you?

480
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,954
No? Then what's the fuss!

481
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:15,192
I amg oing to end it,
but I can't just leave, now!

482
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,510
All right, all right.
I promise this is the very last date.

483
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,629
Yes! Right. Bye.

484
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,154
- What did she say?
- Nothing.

485
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,435
Can we go on watching?

486
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,149
The moment we've all been
waiting for this evening:

487
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,549
The prizes!

488
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,752
I can't hear you... The prizes!

489
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:07,031
Will the winner be
Miss Rinkeby- SubiZimseck?

490
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,958
- She's great.
- Or Miss Alby- Gabi Bolopa?

491
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,833
Or our own honeybunch,
Miss Kista- Linda Johansson?

492
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:27,597
One of these ladies is about
to become 'Miss Suburb, 2002.'

493
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,195
The big question: Who has won?
And it says here:

494
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,592
The winner is...
Can you feel the excitement?

495
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,434
The winner is:
Miss Alby!

496
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,557
Dead right!

497
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,756
Wicked!

498
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,279
All right!

499
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,479
- Hiya.
- Hi.

500
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,789
- Is Sanna at home?
- No. She's on night duty.

501
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,678
- Can I sleep here?
- Yeah, but...

502
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,069
...what's happened?

503
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,997
She's there, kissing...

504
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:57,710
...well she's getting in close
with that idiot from Survivor.

505
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,199
Micke...

506
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,673
About to shove his hairy tongue
down her throat and choke her.

507
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,435
Micke, I know this sounds
a bit like a cliché...

508
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:14,277
...but you've got to forget her.
- I can't.

509
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,155
I know it's really hard...

510
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,475
...but she has really hurt you.
- Yes.

511
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,553
Wait a sec. Put it this way:

512
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:30,191
If she was to come back to you,
do you really think it would work?

513
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,475
- Yes.
- Honestly?

514
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,831
Well... yes. I think it would...

515
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,957
Listen to yourself, you're hesitant.

516
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,231
Yes I am.

517
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,640
So what the hell do I do?

518
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,315
- Mario...
- Yes?

519
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,393
Don't mention this to Simon.

520
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,554
You mean about our sleeping head
to tail in my super-narrow bed?

521
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,557
Precisely.

522
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,989
Simon.

523
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,108
Hi.

524
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,677
I can hear who it is!
What's cookin'?

525
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,757
Come here and chill out, then.

526
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,350
Just zap around a bit.

527
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:46,310
There's someone on the other phone.
I'll come over to your place later.

528
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,389
Bye.

529
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,949
Mia here.

530
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,157
Bonsolr, honey. What are you doing?

531
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,710
Listen, I've spoken to Olivia
at Air France. She said...

532
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,028
Exactly. Which day
would suit you best? Friday?

533
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:14,477
Yes...
No- I'm about to go out.

534
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,552
Can't we discuss it tomorrow?

535
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,631
Call me around ten.

536
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,108
Yes. Great.

537
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,871
Kisses.

538
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,911
Love you, too.

539
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,991
Right. Bye.

540
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,315
- It's piddling down!
- I can see it is. Hi.

541
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,591
- I bought some food.
- Great. Put it there.

542
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,911
- I'll get you a dry shirt.
- Thanks.

543
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,948
- We need to discuss something.
- Just coming.

544
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,909
Oh, my God...

545
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,718
Well, I thought...

546
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,677
- You're...
- Wonderful.

547
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,716
- Crazy!
- Thanks!

548
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,274
- You did say you were hungry.
- But all this!

549
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,870
- What's in the envelope?
- Open it and see.

550
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,554
- Say...
- Open it!

551
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,795
- Jesus, how great!
- Dlrector's cut.

552
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,993
I can take my sister.
She loves Pretty Woman.

553
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,677
Oh... Okay.

554
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,397
I'm pulling your leg.
Of course I'll see it with you.

555
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,159
Right!

556
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,595
What's the matter?

557
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:59,228
- She just left.
- And?

558
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:05,270
- I don't see... Everything was great.
- Didn't she say anything?

559
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,909
Just got up
and said she was sorry.

560
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,912
- Why did she say sorry?
- No idea.

561
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,955
She said: "Sorry, Simon.
I can't explain it," and then... left.

562
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,313
- You've called?
- Answering machine.

563
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,595
- Cell?
- Same there.

564
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:27,356
- Hell! What can I do?
- You can't do anything about it.

565
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:31,672
The ball's in her court.
It's up to her to make contact.

566
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,069
Shit!
Always fucking tilting!

567
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,949
Three wonderful weeks...

568
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:46,160
- Call, put some pressure on.
- Buthow long can I do that for...?

569
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,472
Could that be her?
It could be Mia!

570
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,234
Where the hell's my cellphone?

571
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,390
- Christ, it's her- Mia.
- Answer, then!

572
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,036
Simon here.

573
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,909
Hi.

574
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,234
Whatthe...!
Mia, my battery's running out.

575
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:19,589
Can you call Micke's cell?
0730649424.

576
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,519
Did you get...?

577
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,273
She's going to ring yours.

578
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,428
That's for me! That's for me!

579
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,272
Take it easy!

580
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,430
Micke's phone. This is Simon.
Hi.

581
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,115
Yes.

582
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,874
Ofcourse.

583
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,751
In an hour?

584
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,629
Bye.

585
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:57,795
- Did you sort it out?
- I don'tknow.

586
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:05,230
- Why's Mia's number on your cell?
- Her mates dug Survivor-Micke...

587
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:08,790
...so I offered to date them.
- I see.

588
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,872
- What did she say?
- She sounded so weird.

589
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,350
- She said we had to talk.
- About what?

590
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,238
- I don't know.
- She didn't say?

591
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,197
I just don't get it.

592
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,796
See you later.

593
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,155
- Wish me good luck.
- Good luck.

594
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,832
Good luck.

595
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,795
High score!

596
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,074
- Where are you off to?
- See the boss. It tilts all the time.

597
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,470
- Hi.
- Hi.

598
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,069
- Has something happened?
- Let's walk a bit.

599
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,433
Simon...

600
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,833
Yes?

601
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:14,274
I think it's been really fantastic,
meeting you.

602
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,712
But?

603
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,358
But...

604
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,752
...there's something I haven't told you.

605
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,478
What is it? What's happened?

606
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:33,634
Nothing's happened. Well, yes,
something has happened, or rather...

607
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,872
I don't know how to tell you.

608
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,038
I've got a boyfriend.

609
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,513
What?

610
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,555
It sounds pretty rough,
but it's not rough really.

611
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,551
So it's not rough?

612
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:02,438
Well what the hell Is it, then?

613
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,518
He's in Paris. I'm not sure
we're still steady. Well we are...

614
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:12,071
...but we never see each other...
- Why didn't you tell me?

615
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,438
I would have, but I didn't want
to spoil what we had going.

616
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,513
As if you hadn't
spoilt anything now!

617
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,236
Fuck...

618
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,832
Okay...
So what happens now?

619
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,032
What happens now?

620
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,715
I need to think
about what I really want.

621
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:42,275
Fooling around a bit
until you leave for...

622
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:45,989
- It wasn't like that!
- What was't like, then?!

623
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:50,995
I really like you, Simon.
But I need time to think. Okay?

624
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:57,995
Take all the time you want. I don't
care what the fuck you decide!

625
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,911
Wait a min...

626
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,234
A vodka- cranberry.

627
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,351
A beer, please.

628
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,952
Are you on your own this evening?

629
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,029
Eh?

630
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,719
You ordered just the one beer.

631
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,789
So?

632
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:48,195
If you'd been with friends or your
boyfriend, you'd have ordered more.

633
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:53,718
- The beer's for my boyfriend.
- Woops. Is he French?

634
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,597
Goodbye.

635
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,316
- Hi, little sis'!
- God, how I've missed you!

636
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,516
And I've missed you!

637
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,275
- Is that all you've got?
- Thailand next.

638
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,555
- Are you kidding?
- No.

639
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,629
- How long will you be there?
- Six months.

640
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,110
- I can't face it!
- How are you, then?

641
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:31,715
- I'm fine.
- Are you?

642
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,438
Just a bit hungry.

643
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:38,469
Let's go home and have something
to eat and a glass ofwine. Okay?

644
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,716
How are you, love?
You're so quiet.

645
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,473
I can see something's up.

646
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,077
I've made such a fool of myself.

647
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,518
Is it that bad?
What's happened? Is it Andrés?

648
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:03,789
No.

649
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:09,711
- I've been so damn stupid.
- Oh, sweetheart.

650
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,518
So damn stupid...

651
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,596
It'll be okay.

652
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,233
- Are things serious, you and...?
- Simon.

653
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:33,078
- How did you meet?
- That's the... problem...

654
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:44,192
There was this conspiracy-
our meeting had been planned.

655
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:51,513
- A blind date?
- Well, not really. It was a bit...

656
00:59:55,440 --> 01:00:00,309
I met an old friend at a bar-

657
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:06,032
- and I bet him I could get this
friend of his to fall in love with me.

658
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:10,591
So stupid. But I thought
it sounded a bit of a laugh.

659
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:15,754
I was moving abroad anyway.
But I started seeing this guy and...

660
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:21,588
- And you fell in love with him.
- Head over heals in love.

661
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:25,717
So you won't be moving to Paris.

662
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,837
I don'tknow.

663
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,314
No, I'm...

664
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,235
I might as well move there.

665
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:41,318
Simon hates me now anyway, so...

666
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,271
Could you answer?

667
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,912
Mia's phone. This is Lisa.

668
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,636
Hi, Andrés.

669
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,590
Fine. And you?

670
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,590
No. She's notin.

671
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,960
Oh... Hang on a minute.

672
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:23,437
B J H, okay.

673
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,189
Yes, I'II tell her.
Bye.

674
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,116
What did he say?

675
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,793
Hey... tell me what he said!

676
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,155
He's booked your flight.

677
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,118
- I've got the number.
- Oh, fuck!

678
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,839
Hi, Simon!

679
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,789
Hello.

680
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,589
Hello.

681
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,835
Want to see Simon?

682
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:51,113
There was some blond chick here
but she just split...

683
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,634
For God's sake! Mia!

684
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,789
- Who was that?
- Eh?

685
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,077
No one.

686
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:19,516
- I put your T-shirt on the bed.
- Thanks.

687
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,915
- Hope we meet again some time.
- You bet.

688
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,916
- See you.
- Bye.

689
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:36,989
Bye!

690
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:01,718
Why did she have to turn up
just then?

691
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:06,954
- Why? Is that a crime?
- But she's already got a guy...

692
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:11,591
...so she's playing it wrong. Not you!
- Perhaps she came to say...

693
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:17,118
...that she'd dumped the French guy.
- That's just your imagination.

694
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,793
Forget the whole thing.

695
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,751
Yeah, maybe.

696
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:33,794
What if I've ruined everything
due to a stupid one-night stand.

697
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:38,237
All you can do is
find out how she feels about it all.

698
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:45,398
- That'd be heavy shit.
- But it could hardly make it worse.

699
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,277
Forget her now!

700
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:54,473
That's my opinion. She's been
lying to you. You deserve better.

701
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,431
The bloody soap stings!

702
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,756
- We've got to talk.
- Well... come in.

703
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:22,512
- You mustn't let Simon in on all this.
- I've got to!

704
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,434
- Don't. It'll onlym ake things worse.
- Maybe...

705
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:30,718
...but I can't go on lying.
- Notlie, just say nothing!

706
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,997
- You're not seeing him anymore.
- No?

707
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:38,835
- But you're moving to Paris!
- Micke, don't you understand?

708
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:44,748
- I'm in love with Simon.
- In love? Correct me if I'm wrong...

709
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:50,073
...but, only yesterday,
didn't he screw some other girl?

710
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,677
You've won your 2,000.
So now it's over.

711
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,150
D'you think I'm stupid?
To hell with the bet!

712
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,752
- Who's that?
- It'll be my sister.

713
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,874
- How old is she?
- Shut up!

714
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:15,270
Just a joke... just fooling.

715
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,029
Simon!

716
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,073
- Why are you here?
- Can I come in?

717
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,149
What?

718
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,319
I think we ought to talk.

719
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,631
Yes, but... can't we...

720
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:40,316
Can't I come over to your place
this evening? I've got so much...

721
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,868
- Right. About eight?
- Great.

722
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:47,073
- Is Micke here?
- How come?

723
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,118
That's his jacket!

724
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,150
- Hiya... Simon!
- Hiya, yourself!

725
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:02,233
- What are you doing here?
- What I'm doing here?

726
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:09,155
Well, Mia... borrowed one of my CDs.

727
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:11,669
ACD?

728
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,470
I thought I'd just... pick it up and...

729
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,469
...well, I'll be going.
I'll call you later...

730
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:28,877
"Meditation."
And when did you start meditating?

731
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,590
- So you didn't know I did?
- Quit it, Micke, for God's sake!

732
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:40,597
There's something
we've got to tell you, Simon.

733
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:44,719
That girl with a crush
on Survivor-Micke is nuts...

734
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,678
Shut up, Micke! Let Mia speak.

735
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:53,510
- I've got to split...
- Stay here, you!

736
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,719
Well? Out with it. Let's have it!

737
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:09,832
I met Micke down at the bar
and we started talking a bit-

738
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:16,473
- and he told me about a friend
who'd never fallen in love. That's it.

739
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:24,399
- Really? And?
- And...

740
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:32,594
...so... he bet me I couldn't get you
to fall in love with me in two weeks.

741
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,559
- What?
- We bet 2,000.

742
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:43,599
We set it up like a Hollywood movie.
Right, Micke?

743
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,638
Like a what?

744
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:51,510
You wanted the Hollywood movie life.
I thought I'd help you.

745
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,310
- You're fucking crazy!
- You weren't meant to find out...

746
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,392
How kind!
So that justifies it all?

747
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,114
It's... just not true!

748
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,229
- It's so crazy!
- I'm really sorry, Simon...

749
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:15,714
That dogtrick...
Was the whole thing fixed?

750
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,152
Yes, it was.

751
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,398
Yes...

752
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,792
Jesus, Mia, you're so damn...

753
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:39,270
It's so goddam sick!

754
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:44,190
And you, Micke...
You can go to hell!

755
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:49,435
My back's hardly turned
and you're screwing someone else!

756
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,069
- Who's got a boyfriend!
- I don't screw around!

757
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:56,391
I'm damn glad I screwed her!

758
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,599
She didn't get paid.

759
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:05,676
Or have you fixed that, too,
Survivor-Micke?

760
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:21,758
Christ, couldn't you goddam see
I was so in love with you?

761
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:28,196
Simon here.
Please leave a message.

762
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:33,749
Hi, Simon, it's me... Mia.

763
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:41,153
I just want to say I'm very sorry
about what's happened-

764
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:44,232
- and I'd like to talk to you.

765
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:50,190
Would you give me a call, so I can
explain? Please let me do that.

766
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,157
I miss you.

767
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,399
Goodbye.

768
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:31,035
- How could you be so fucking stupid?
- I wanted to help him.

769
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,912
Can't you try and explain to me...

770
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,312
As a friend, how could you
think up something so idiotic-

771
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,188
- without realizing
it might end in disaster?

772
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,879
- Well, I thought she might...
- You didn't think at all, it seems.

773
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:57,235
- You've got to sort it with Simon.
- Don't you think I've tried?

774
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:02,269
I've been over there, but he won't
open. He won't answer the phone.

775
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:06,478
I even went to his college,
but he's not been there for days.

776
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:11,634
God knows what you can do. But, if
I were Simon, I'd never forgive you.

777
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:15,754
No...

778
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,639
Hi.

779
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,950
Oh... 2114.
I always thought it was 1421.

780
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:37,389
I've only been getting
your answering machine.

781
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:41,189
Perhaps your cell's
been playing up...

782
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,633
Sorry.

783
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:51,794
I'm sorry... I wanted to help you feel
what it was like to be in love...

784
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:57,193
...as you never had been.
I thought you might think it was cool.

785
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:01,353
Listen to me! I'm apologizing!
At least you could...

786
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:13,150
Hi, Simon. It's me, agaln.

787
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:18,473
I would really Iike to talk to you,
but you're not at home, or...

788
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,791
...maybe you'd rather not talk to me.

789
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,152
Simon, I'm...

790
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:31,315
Never mind. I'm at home.
You can call me. Bye.

791
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:51,873
I might as well move.
Simon'll never forgive me...

792
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:56,397
Andrés may feel far off, now.
But, once you're in Paris...

793
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:01,873
Do you honestly believe
I'll think anyless about Simon there?

794
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:05,111
But you've hurt each other so badly!

795
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,276
It'll be good to get away,
so you can long for each other a bit.

796
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,153
But...

797
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:19,070
...I don't even know if I'm going. First
I want to sort things out with Simon.

798
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,435
And Andrés?

799
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,917
It's a damn pain. Get it?

800
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,191
- Eh?
- What's the time?!

801
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:10,550
Mia... Look at this, it's way out!

802
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,632
I'm going...

803
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,036
I am going to Paris.

804
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,472
Bella!

805
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,957
What's happened?

806
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,715
It's over. Well, we've had a fight...

807
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:40,715
...and Pontus, he's...
- Come inside and have some tea...

808
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,030
...if you like.

809
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:50,197
Shall I see if the tea's done?

810
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,549
- Do you want a sandwich?
- Yes. But...

811
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:57,757
No butter
and only one cheese slice.

812
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,990
I haven't forgotten!

813
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:04,235
I'll see to it.

814
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,477
Hi, it's me.

815
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,437
Did I wake you?

816
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:26,392
No... It's just that it's a bit late
in the evening.

817
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:29,472
Good.

818
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,913
No, I was just...
I'll be there on Sunday.

819
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:39,034
Brilliant. Okay, then. Kisses.

820
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,235
Bye.

821
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,072
Who was it?

822
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,720
Just my mother.

823
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,599
- This is cozy.
- Yeah.

824
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:21,032
- Excuse me, Micke, but...
- What?

825
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:24,998
Have you ever thought...

826
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:29,437
...what it would be like
if it was still you and me?

827
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,595
Well... I have thought about it
on and off.

828
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:38,117
With Pontus it was never
like it was with you and me.

829
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:41,229
- Wasn't it?
- No.

830
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:47,718
- Micke... do you know what I believe?
- No.

831
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,588
- This is fate.
- You think so?

832
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:56,037
We're meant to be together,
you and me.

833
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,431
Yes.

834
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:12,158
I've missed you so much.

835
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:15,869
- I've missed you, too.
- Have you?

836
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:32,473
What do you want?

837
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,072
It doesn't matter where I am,
as I'm not...

838
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,273
What?

839
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:45,677
Do you really want that?
Ooh!

840
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,315
You're not kidding?

841
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:58,389
Okay, I'll be there.
You are fantast...

842
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,158
Kisses!

843
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,832
I've gotto go.

844
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:08,630
It was Pontus. This is crazy...
but he wants to get engaged!

845
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,516
"Hi, Simon,
as you won't talk to me or see me"-

846
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:15,116
- "this would seem to be
the only way to get through to you."

847
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:21,673
"I'm really sorry about how it turned
out. It wasn't meant to go this far."

848
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:26,515
"And I wasn't meant to fall in love
with you, either. But I did."

849
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:31,037
"When I realized I was falling in love,
I wanted to explain."

850
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:34,590
"But suddenly it was all too late."

851
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,875
"I could understand
your never forgiving me."

852
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:42,475
"You will always be in myheart."

853
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:48,271
"I won't be bothering you again.
Today I'm flying to Paris, to Andrés."

854
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:51,670
"Just as well,
after all that's happened."

855
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,597
"Forgive me, Simon.
Mia."

856
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:01,271
"PS Don't be too hard on Micke.
He means well."

857
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:15,668
Mia.

858
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,714
Mia, it's Simon. Open up!

859
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:23,513
Mia, please, open the door!

860
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:24,874
- Hey...
- What?

861
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,157
No point in knocking.
They're not home.

862
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:32,313
- D'you know where they are?
- Left... for Taiwan.

863
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:36,188
- When?
- An hour ago... more or less.

864
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:37,998
Damn!

865
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:59,435
- Hi... Howmuch to Arlanda Airport?
- I can run you out for 400.

866
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,715
- 400?
- Yup.

867
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,593
Forget it!

868
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:18,034
- How are you feeling, sweetheart?
- I'm okay.

869
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,554
Mario.

870
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:37,515
Hiya, Simon... What?

871
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,351
Cool down...

872
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:45,753
Okay...
Now?

873
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:52,668
Mia!

874
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:09,677
Faster, Sanna, please! If we don't
make it... You're only doing 20...

875
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:12,957
Cool it! We're doing the best we can.

876
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:16,591
What's that?

877
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,634
- What are you doing?!
- There's a queue, Simon...

878
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:27,430
I just don't believe this is happening!
For Christ's sake!

879
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:34,874
Why the hell's she moving to Paris?
Could someone please explain!

880
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:44,233
- You're sure you'll be okay now?
- Of course I will be.

881
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,718
But things'll be great in Paris!

882
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,397
Yes, I suppose so.

883
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:55,393
I'll miss you.
I'll come and visit as soon as poss.

884
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,271
Hi. Listen...

885
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:09,637
Forget that now.

886
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:14,711
Micke, we can talk later.
When's the next Paris flight?

887
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,755
What! In 15 minutes?

888
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,549
We won't make it.

889
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,068
It's Mia.

890
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,155
Right... of course.

891
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,918
Listen, Simon...

892
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:35,198
We'll talk later. Right. Bye.

893
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,192
- What are you doing?
- Christ!

894
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:49,473
Who's that idiot, honking?

895
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,871
Hey, you!

896
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,996
Christ, it's him!

897
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:05,229
- Hiya, friend!
- You've gotto help me... The airport!

898
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,276
I've gotten minutes.

899
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,196
- Is it the girl?
- Yes.

900
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:15,871
We'll be there in five minutes.
Jump in!

901
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:19,111
See you at Arlanda.
I'll explain later.

902
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,875
- Hi, man.
- You're a hero.

903
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:38,358
Passport and boarding card, please.

904
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,875
- Bon voyage.
- Thanks.

905
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,315
They're chasing us.

906
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,753
The police.

907
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:57,671
Hell! Could've known!

908
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:03,113
- Stop, then.
- Are you crazy?

909
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:07,830
- It's the cops, for God's sake!
- But she'll be gone if we stop!

910
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:12,269
- Remember my Vinnie?
- Eh?

911
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,193
- The girl in the photo.
- Yes.

912
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:20,354
She vanished, because the cops
stopped us. But they won't this time!

913
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:25,832
- They're getting closer.
- Cool it. Just you wait!

914
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,909
- Move! Run!
- But the police...

915
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,434
Forget it. I'll deal with it.

916
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:06,399
- I'll never forget this, Tubbs.
- Give her my best!

917
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:27,878
Damn!

918
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,955
- Information.
- Sorry?

919
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:34,953
- Where's Information?
- Down there.

920
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,437
Hi. Can I help you?

921
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,829
- I'm sorry?
- Gate 2.

922
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:50,798
- You want Gate 2?
- Gate 2. Quick!

923
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,599
Down to the end, then right.

924
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,198
Don't mention it.

925
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:58,871
Hi! Can I help you?

926
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,351
Well... Hi, there...

927
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:04,432
..."Veronica C."
Ready for me?

928
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:07,593
- What's the time?
- 1.25 p.m.

929
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:12,117
Really? I thought I'd be on a flight
to Geneva at 1.25 p.m.

930
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,998
So sorry. There's a one-hour delay.

931
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:20,950
It's fantastic for me to know
you're so sorry. Do you follow?

932
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:26,478
Knowing you're sorry will get me to
Geneva much faster. Or am I wrong?

933
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,513
- Get in the queue!
- Slow down! Wai there!

934
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:44,310
- Passport and boarding car...
- My girl's waiting in there.

935
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:47,437
Passport and boarding card.
Please!

936
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:54,117
Micke, baggage handling, Survivor-
Micke... Open the door for God's sake!

937
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:58,432
Showme your passport and card,
or go to the back of the queue.

938
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:03,589
- You're a frigging idiot!
- Just doing my job.

939
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:06,240
- Straighten your tie.
- Next.

940
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,475
- Hiya!
- Hiya, mate.

941
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,313
- Is this the Paris load?
- Yup.

942
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,752
- Hi!
- Hi, there!

943
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:57,991
I found this little guy over there...

944
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:01,231
...crying.
He must have lost his parents.

945
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:04,109
Poor fellow.

946
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:08,159
Lost your mummy and daddy?
Have you?

947
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:12,995
- No...
- Yes. Right. They must be around.

948
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:16,595
Can you look after him?
I've got my flight.

949
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:18,398
- Gate 2?
- Right.

950
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,038
Come round.

951
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:24,191
There now...

952
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:26,032
What the...!

953
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:32,389
- Sorry. I've gotto do this.
- Don't close... Open it! It's a break-in!

954
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:39,109
Can't anyone help? Security,
come here! God, you take your time!

955
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,270
- What is it?
- Break-in!

956
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,237
- He works here?
- No!

957
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:45,231
Come out of there!

958
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:56,558
Mia! It's Simon. Are you listening?
I've got somethingto say.

959
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:04,354
I was drunk.
Itwas so stupid, so idiotic.

960
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:07,034
What in God's name's he up to?

961
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:10,237
Don't leave because of that, Mia!

962
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:14,589
I know I haven't answered
when you've called-

963
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:16,910
- but I've needed time.

964
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:21,039
I'm still angry with you and Micke,
and you are with me.

965
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:26,510
Forget it all, Mia!
Because I'm deeply in love with you.

966
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:33,039
I realize now it's you I want,
only you.

967
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:36,394
So, Mia, if you can hear me...

968
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:41,031
Don't get on that plane!
Paris isn't for you, I promise you.

969
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,757
We've got to give love a chance,
you and me.

970
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,195
Mia...

971
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,920
...I love you.

972
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,755
I want to be with you.

973
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:03,872
Hollywood movies aren't like this,
they don'thave unhappy endings.

974
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:27,030
Great stuff, mate! Great stuff.

975
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:30,397
- Thanks.
- You'll have to come with me.

976
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:37,312
What are you up to?
Have you gone nuts?

977
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:40,710
I'll call Micke,
so he can sort it out.

978
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,677
Are you okay?

979
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,076
Simon!

980
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:00,075
Go on, feller!

981
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,350
It's cool.

982
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:20,552
- You came!
- Of course I did!

983
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:44,273
- How did you know I was here?
- I got your letter.

984
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:46,715
What d'you mean? What...?

985
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:55,188
What is it?

986
01:36:27,040 --> 01:36:28,837
Great, man!

987
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:12,113
Aren't you Survivor-Micke?

988
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:17,277
- Yes. That's me.
- Could I have your autograph?

989
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:20,915
I should think so.

990
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,434
- What's your name?
- Emma.

991
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,516
There you are, Emma.

992
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:32,756
- Thanks.
- That's okay. Emma!

993
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:37,476
You can have this, too,
seeing as I like you.

994
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,715
- There you go.
- Thanks. Great!

995
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:48,869
Bye!

996
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:14,917
Mario doesn't know
about our little bet, eh?
