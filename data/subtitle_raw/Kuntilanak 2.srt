1
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,257
Your Highness!

2
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,833
I have set you free.

3
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:59,813
Now, please teach me black magic.

4
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,208
Ambar!

5
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:00,792
Ambar!

6
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:03,495
Ambar!

7
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:08,958
Have you found her yet?

8
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,091
Not yet, where on earth is she?

9
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,958
Mom must be worried sick at home.

10
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:15,656
Try to reach her again
through her walkie-talkie.

11
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,406
Ambar, do you read me?

12
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,583
No answer.

13
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:28,481
Try to reach Panji and Kresna.

14
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:32,124
Kresna, do you read me?

15
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,102
I'll look for her over there.

16
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,791
<i>-Panji, do you read me?</i>
-Come on, you almost got it!

17
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,124
Aim for that one!

18
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,541
Watch for the wind!

19
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,500
Hurry up already! It's our turn now!

20
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:48,958
Be quiet! He's concentrating.

21
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:52,167
You guys will take the heat
if he misses the target.

22
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:04,208
<i>Take a deep breath with a calm mind.</i>

23
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:10,292
<i>Relax your body,
and you can start this exercise.</i>

24
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:15,541
<i>Now, imagine...</i>

25
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:21,000
<i>...your pain as a white orb
that emits healing light.</i>

26
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:24,732
What? Okay, I take this off!

27
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,292
Hey.

28
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,000
What's wrong?

29
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,167
Edwin.

30
00:05:30,917 --> 00:05:33,958
You know that my mom told me
to watch the kids, don't you?

31
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,708
Are you sure you're my boyfriend?
You're not helping at all.

32
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:40,007
Okay, look.

33
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:43,666
We shouldn't panic
in a situation like this.

34
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,208
We have to be calm.
Otherwise, we'll make a wrong move.

35
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:49,959
We should just close our eyes now...

36
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:52,042
...and take a deep breath.

37
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,458
Hold it for a second...

38
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,667
...and exhale slowly.

39
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,535
Done. Do you feel more relaxed now?

40
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:11,333
Ambar, do you read me? Copy.

41
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,750
I worry about you.

42
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,750
Ambar!

43
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,667
Ambar!

44
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:37,333
Ambar!

45
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,249
Kresna!

46
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,374
Grab the prize from him!

47
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:42,833
Don't you dare.

48
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:43,874
No!

49
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:44,833
Help me!

50
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:47,042
Let go! This is for my sister!

51
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,625
The doll's head is cut off!

52
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:52,542
You guys are jerks!

53
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,333
Panji! Kresna!

54
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:57,124
-Come on, run!
-Run!

55
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,708
Hey, don't go! You little...

56
00:06:58,792 --> 00:06:59,833
That's enough!

57
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:02,167
Ambar!

58
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:28,667
Ambar!

59
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:37,740
Ambar!

60
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,583
<i>Ambar?</i>

61
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,083
<i>Ambar, do you read me?</i>

62
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,542
Ambar!

63
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,167
<i>Ambar, do you read me? Copy.</i>

64
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:52,958
<i>Ambar, do you read me?</i>

65
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,792
I'm on the Ferris wheel, Miko.

66
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,433
How did she get up there?

67
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:15,749
-Ambar?
-Ambar!

68
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,291
Dinda!

69
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,625
Ambar!

70
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,667
Oh, my God, Ambar!

71
00:08:23,542 --> 00:08:25,164
How did you get up there?

72
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:30,833
A beautiful woman took me up there.

73
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:32,375
Where is she now?

74
00:08:33,457 --> 00:08:34,874
I don't know.

75
00:08:34,957 --> 00:08:36,082
She's gone.

76
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,625
Don't tell me...

77
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,416
...that she was a Kuntilanak.

78
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,236
-Miko!
-Miko!

79
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,458
The Kuntilanak is already gone.
Dinda has defeated her.

80
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:51,167
Kuntilanak?

81
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:52,333
Wow.

82
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,181
You guys have quite an imagination.

83
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,833
Does Kuntilanak really exist?

84
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:00,083
-Yes, she does!
-Yes, she does!

85
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,458
-Have you guys seen her?
-Yes, we have.

86
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:05,624
Yes, I have!

87
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,125
Okay.

88
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,792
If you don't believe her existence,

89
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,525
she will come and haunt you.

90
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:31,945
Isn't that scary?

91
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,833
You should be careful, Edwin.

92
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:37,417
Stop it!

93
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:39,999
Stop talking nonsense!

94
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,625
Let's go home now.

95
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,375
Let's go.

96
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,667
See?

97
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:03,660
I told you to always stick together!

98
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:08,012
You should not be preoccupied
with yourselves and ignore the others!

99
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,084
Thank God you found Ambar!

100
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:14,179
If she had been missing,
who would be responsible?

101
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,249
It was my fault, Mom.

102
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,124
I failed to look after her.

103
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,559
If one of you failed,
it means all of you failed!

104
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:25,499
You are all grounded
for the next three days!

105
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,250
Oh, no!

106
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,905
You too, Young Lady.

107
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:42,537
Now, you should all take a bath
and go to bed.

108
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,083
Okay?

109
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:47,042
Come on, Ambar.

110
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:54,208
Mom.

111
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,347
Next time, I promise to be more careful.

112
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,792
Sure, Dear.

113
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,208
Listen.

114
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:08,416
I just want them to be able
to take care of each other.

115
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,667
That's all.

116
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:14,236
Having brothers and sisters like them
is a wonderful feeling, isn't it?

117
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,458
I can't imagine if one day
I have to go back to Los Angeles,

118
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:22,307
I will surely miss them so much.

119
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,333
Be careful, Julia.

120
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:29,288
They are very good
at making people miss them.

121
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,833
I'm coming!

122
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:54,167
Good afternoon, Mrs Dona.

123
00:11:54,792 --> 00:11:56,250
Let me introduce myself.

124
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:59,667
I am Karmila, Dinda's biological mother.

125
00:12:01,084 --> 00:12:07,419
I'm sorry for coming here
without any notice, Mrs Dona.

126
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:12,542
Actually, I've been tracking Dinda
for a very long time now.

127
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:17,072
And I just found out that Dinda is here.

128
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:20,875
I'm sorry.

129
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:24,499
But do you have anything,
or maybe a document...

130
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:28,375
...which can prove that you really are
Dinda's biological mother?

131
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,787
I've visited Mrs Tantri,
the head of the orphanage.

132
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,062
I was the one who put Dinda there.

133
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:57,334
And I still remember the shape
of the baby basket,

134
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,071
her blanket,

135
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:07,865
and even if I have to describe
the situation that night,

136
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:09,606
I still remember.

137
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:18,587
Why did you leave her there?

138
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:23,531
I'm sorry, Ma'am.
I can't tell you that.

139
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,753
It's for her own sake.

140
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:38,624
I would like to express
my gratitude for you...

141
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:41,232
...for taking care of Dinda
all this time.

142
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,708
Sure.

143
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:47,336
-But...
-Ma'am.

144
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:50,925
I'm not planning
to take Dinda right away.

145
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,016
I know how you feel.

146
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,235
Thank you.

147
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,350
Whenever you are ready,

148
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:05,331
please bring Dinda to my place.

149
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:15,542
I will be waiting for her.

150
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,000
Mom.

151
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,667
Dinda.

152
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:46,208
Is it true that the woman who came by
is my biological mother?

153
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:48,584
Well, that's what she told me.

154
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,245
However, I still need to reconfirm it.

155
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:53,820
You don't believe her?

156
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:55,583
I don't.

157
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:58,113
Since all of this comes so sudden,
I have to be careful.

158
00:14:58,708 --> 00:15:02,224
Besides, I found her attitude
rather strange.

159
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,583
-Strange?
-Yes.

160
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:07,208
I have to check with Mrs Tantri first.

161
00:15:07,292 --> 00:15:10,660
I've been calling her all day,
but she's unreachable.

162
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:17,440
Even if you think she's strange,
I still want to see my mother.

163
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,737
Yes, I understand.

164
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:26,978
But please give me a little more time
to be completely sure, okay?

165
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,708
-You're doing this on purpose, right?
-No, I'm not.

166
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:31,286
You don't want me to go.

167
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,471
It's not like that, Dinda.

168
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,738
Don't you want to see me happy?

169
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:56,848
Of course. But I just want to...

170
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,667
Dinda!

171
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:36,000
A heart?

172
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,667
Dinda?

173
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,619
Whatever issues you have or we have,

174
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:08,006
leaving this house is not the solution.

175
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,833
I strongly believe...

176
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,210
...if you ask mom's permission first,

177
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,749
you'd have a better chance
to solve your problem.

178
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,214
And if she grants her permission,

179
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,545
I will go with you.

180
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,333
We will come too, Dinda.

181
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,458
Me too.

182
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:46,125
We will all go with you.

183
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,969
If you are absolutely sure about that,

184
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:54,748
I won't stand in your way.

185
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,667
Julia.

186
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,875
You must accompany her.

187
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:01,034
I will, Mom.

188
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:03,731
But...

189
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,434
...the others also wants to come.

190
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,416
It's because they said that they are...

191
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,875
Family.

192
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,792
That's right.

193
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:21,333
Is Edwin coming along too?

194
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,042
Yes, he is, Mom.

195
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:25,833
Take good care of them.

196
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,583
Don't worry about it, Mom.

197
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:40,666
<i>Let's go, let's go, up to the forest</i>

198
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,625
<i>It's a very long journey</i>

199
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:48,541
<i>Look left, look right
There's nothing but trees</i>

200
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:52,300
<i>It's really boring</i>

201
00:18:52,383 --> 00:18:55,708
Edwin, they say
that this is a forbidden forest.

202
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,935
Which forest?

203
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:03,791
Aokigahara forest in Japan is known
as a place to commit suicide.

204
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,833
As for this forest,

205
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:09,417
people often come here
to find black magic.

206
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,591
You guys are crazy. You're too young
to believe in scary stories.

207
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,167
But this is a fact.

208
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,750
I think we've found the address.

209
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:43,375
Yeah.

210
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,583
Julia...

211
00:19:57,417 --> 00:19:58,995
What's wrong, Ambar?

212
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,875
I need to poop.

213
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,374
-Please pull over, Edwin.
-Okay, hold on a second.

214
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:07,083
Don't stop here.
This is a haunted forest!

215
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:10,791
Cut it out, Miko!
She has an upset stomach!

216
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:12,374
What if she poops here?

217
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,291
This is a spooky forest, Fatty!

218
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,208
So you want to do this again, Skinny?

219
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:18,583
-What, Fatty?
-Come on, knock it off!

220
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:19,666
That's enough, Miko!

221
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,124
-Stop it, Panji, Miko!
-Enough...

222
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,500
Watch the road!

223
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,011
Are you guys okay?

224
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,208
Are you okay, Panji?

225
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,667
The car won't start.

226
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:46,875
What was that?

227
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,660
What kind of fur is this?

228
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,458
It looks like human hair.

229
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,042
It's not animal fur?

230
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,500
There's no trace of anything either.

231
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,375
Edwin!

232
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:22,227
-I think we've arrived.
-Really?

233
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,750
Look!

234
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,586
Yeah.

235
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:29,795
-Let's just push the car, then.
-Alright.

236
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,417
We're almost there!

237
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:38,000
Keep pushing.

238
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:39,624
Just a little bit more.

239
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:42,708
Stop it here. Okay!

240
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,333
-Is this the place?
-Yeah.

241
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:01,083
This is definitely the place.

242
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:44,875
Excuse me, Ma'am.

243
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,625
I am Julia, Mrs Dona's youngest daughter.

244
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:55,375
And these are my little brothers
and sisters.

245
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,874
This is...

246
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,958
I am Edwin, her boyfriend.

247
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:05,916
We come here to find...

248
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,274
Who's the little one back there?

249
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:21,958
Hello, Ma'am. My name is Kresna.

250
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:23,416
-This is Miko.
-Hi.

251
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,458
This one is Panji,
and that little girl is Ambar.

252
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:28,717
-And that one is...
-Dinda.

253
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,000
That's right, Ma'am.

254
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:59,157
I'm so glad to have you in my arms.

255
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:09,125
Ambar, are you okay?

256
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,542
Excuse me, Ma'am.
May we use the toilet?

257
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,208
Sure.

258
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,292
It's right over there.

259
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,083
Thank you.

260
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:23,749
Let's go to the toilet.

261
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:24,999
Julia, here.

262
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,792
-I need to fix the car.
-Okay.

263
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,333
Let's go.

264
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,499
Come on in.

265
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,958
It's okay, Ma'am.
We will wait outside.

266
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,563
But I'm so tired.

267
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:41,657
Did you say you wanted to enjoy
the scenery?

268
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,335
When did I say that?

269
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,999
I said this forest is...

270
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:49,708
We're so happy to be here, Ma'am.

271
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:50,958
Is that right?

272
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,417
Thank you.

273
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:55,250
Let's go inside, Dinda.

274
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:04,041
We should give Dinda and her mother
time to get to know each other.

275
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,350
Let's just stay outside for a moment.

276
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:22,792
Get in, Ambar.

277
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:12,792
When did you take that picture, Mom?

278
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:16,917
It was taken a long time ago.

279
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:24,458
Kresna, what is that?

280
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,417
Let's go over there.

281
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:55,000
-Kresna.
-What is it?

282
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,637
Why do I have a bad feeling?

283
00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:01,379
What do you mean?

284
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,542
Let's just go inside the house.

285
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:10,792
Come on.

286
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,458
Are you done, Ambar?

287
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:26,833
Not yet.

288
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:16,124
Calm down.

289
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:17,702
-It's me.
-You startled me!

290
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:19,875
Are you okay?

291
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,801
-Wow!
-Wow!

292
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:04,004
I'm sure you are all very tired.

293
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:07,557
I have prepared your rooms.

294
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:15,092
The boys can go to the room
at the first door to the right.

295
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:21,345
Julia and Ambar can stay
in Dinda's former room.

296
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,307
-Let's go.
-Okay.

297
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:38,193
Let's go.

298
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,750
Thank you, Ma'am.

299
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:40,875
Let's go.

300
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:43,249
-I am first!
-No! Move it!

301
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:45,000
Move it!

302
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,500
Move!

303
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:48,916
-This is my bed.
-No, it's mine!

304
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,083
-This is mine!
-No, it's mine!

305
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:52,624
-Let's do rock, paper, scissors.
-Okay.

306
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,966
Come, I want to show you something.

307
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,833
By the way, Edwin,

308
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:05,333
don't you feel that there
is something creepy about this place?

309
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,669
After all, this house
is in the middle of a haunted forest.

310
00:30:18,625 --> 00:30:21,106
Why don't you do yoga
to calm your nerves? Come on.

311
00:30:21,792 --> 00:30:23,874
Kresna, Panji, let's do some yoga.

312
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:25,500
This will make us calm.

313
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,458
Over here, Miko.

314
00:30:29,292 --> 00:30:32,473
You will feel and sleep better.

315
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,208
Okay?

316
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,833
Come on.

317
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:38,000
Where is Miko?

318
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:39,667
There you are.

319
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:43,592
Okay, take a deep breath.

320
00:30:54,083 --> 00:30:55,958
Exhale slowly.

321
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:01,542
Are you feeling better now?

322
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:09,125
Miko, where are the others?

323
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,292
Kresna!

324
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,708
-What is it?
-Come and take a look at this!

325
00:32:01,042 --> 00:32:02,542
Come here!

326
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:08,167
Wow!

327
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,250
These are some great collections!

328
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:23,624
Marvelous!

329
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:26,624
Take a look.
All the Pandava knights are here!

330
00:32:26,708 --> 00:32:29,136
There is Bima, Arjuna,

331
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,249
Yudistira,

332
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:33,722
Nakula, and Sadewa.

333
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:37,526
Kresna, what is this white screen for?

334
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:41,100
This is called <i>geber,</i>
a screen to play shadow puppets.

335
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,499
How do we play shadow puppets?

336
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:44,833
Let me show you.

337
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:47,750
Move, please.

338
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:51,583
What are you doing?

339
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:54,625
Seriously?

340
00:32:58,292 --> 00:33:00,292
Oh, my God! Why are they lights out?

341
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,833
Kresna!

342
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:05,375
Hey, Panji.

343
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:10,167
I have bad news for you.

344
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:14,666
Beware, Kuwera,
the leader of evil spirits will come.

345
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,749
The ruler of Alanka...

346
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:20,017
...and the leader of darkness
will be summoned!

347
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:31,308
I have prepared everything
that you've asked for.

348
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,176
Every child that has been left here,

349
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:40,659
always has their picture taken.

350
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,742
I...

351
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,933
...also found this letter
in Dinda's baby basket.

352
00:35:00,417 --> 00:35:01,599
Dear.

353
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:03,739
Do you like it?

354
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:09,917
All of these...

355
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:12,125
Did you make them?

356
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:15,458
Yes, I made them myself.

357
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:19,917
I'd be happy if you want to try
to make one.

358
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:21,875
What do you say?

359
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,833
This clay pot too.

360
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:49,231
You are a very special child.

361
00:35:58,917 --> 00:35:59,958
Come on.

362
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,652
Try to finish this one, okay?

363
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:04,833
Go on.

364
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:06,875
Do you want to try to make this one?

365
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,667
I will help you.

366
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:24,670
Ambar.

367
00:36:28,292 --> 00:36:29,469
Ambar.

368
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:32,011
Where have you been?

369
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:36,667
Hey.

370
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:38,518
What's wrong?

371
00:36:40,833 --> 00:36:42,871
Dinda is so mean.

372
00:36:46,042 --> 00:36:47,708
What do you mean by that?

373
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:51,484
I'm afraid she will ask me to go home.

374
00:36:58,708 --> 00:37:02,124
Hail, all forces of darkness,

375
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:06,124
evil spirits,
masters of the Alanka region,

376
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:08,525
Kuwera has summoned you to come!

377
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:15,132
Beware, the wrathful evil spirits
will come as they are sent by...

378
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,875
Kresna!

379
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,541
Kresna!

380
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:38,833
Kresna!

381
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:42,250
Why are you watching from here?

382
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:46,000
I just saw...

383
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:47,834
Saw what?

384
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:49,375
I saw...

385
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,318
Are you okay?

386
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:54,645
Of course I am. What's the matter?

387
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:59,589
Empty your mind.

388
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:07,354
Free all the irrational thoughts.

389
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:14,664
Miko? Did you fall a sleep?

390
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:21,333
No, I didn't.

391
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:25,958
Okay.

392
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,958
Don't snore again, okay?

393
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:31,542
Listen to me.

394
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:34,167
Take a deep breath.

395
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:41,250
Miko?

396
00:38:58,167 --> 00:38:59,958
No!

397
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:06,583
Edwin!

398
00:39:06,667 --> 00:39:09,167
Edwin!

399
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:12,000
Just go home!

400
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:16,583
This place is dangerous.

401
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:19,000
Edwin!

402
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:21,042
You will be...

403
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:23,124
...taken by...

404
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:26,208
...Kuntilanak!

405
00:39:26,292 --> 00:39:28,374
Kresna!

406
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:30,083
Panji!

407
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,250
Miko?

408
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,916
What's the matter? Edwin?

409
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,291
Edwin?

410
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,333
Edwin is acting strange, Julia.

411
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,208
-Edwin?
-Edwin!

412
00:39:39,292 --> 00:39:41,375
-Edwin?
-Edwin?

413
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:44,124
Edwin?

414
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:46,749
-Edwin?
-Edwin!

415
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:47,958
Edwin!

416
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:51,958
-Edwin!
-Edwin?

417
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:55,291
Edwin?

418
00:39:55,375 --> 00:40:00,624
I'm sure he did something
that was inappropriate...

419
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:03,167
...on the way through the forest.

420
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:06,583
That's why...

421
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,999
...the spirits here
felt disturbed by him.

422
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:11,292
You see?

423
00:40:11,917 --> 00:40:13,458
What did I tell you?

424
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:16,333
This forest is haunted!

425
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:19,167
I must give this letter...

426
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:23,624
...when someone comes by
and claims...

427
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:25,708
...that she is Mrs Karmila.

428
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:28,727
<i>Please read this letter very carefully.</i>

429
00:40:30,542 --> 00:40:34,499
<i>It all began when our dream came true.</i>

430
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:37,083
<i>Having our own remote small cottage.</i>

431
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:38,250
This is all for you.

432
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:43,291
<i>We didn't know the people
at the village called the place...</i>

433
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:45,875
<i>...as the lair of Kuntilanak.</i>

434
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:50,583
<i>Many people had been reported missing.</i>

435
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,083
<i>But we didn't believe them,</i>

436
00:40:54,167 --> 00:40:56,678
<i>even though many strange
incidents occurred.</i>

437
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:05,645
<i>It was until she came for the first time.</i>

438
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,980
<i>I saw her appear in front of my eyes.</i>

439
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:15,322
<i>We finally realized that night...</i>

440
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:19,166
<i>...that as one of the cult followers
of Mangkujiwo...</i>

441
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,874
<i>...which has been passed down
for generations to our family.</i>

442
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:23,917
This is inevitable, Karmila!

443
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:28,374
We can't deny what has been
ingrained upon us.

444
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:30,416
This black magic. This curse!

445
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,083
That creature thinks...

446
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:35,499
...she can take every firstborn
of Mangkujiwo bloodlines,

447
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:37,916
but not our daughter, Honey.

448
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,041
Never.

449
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:41,708
But this is what that creature desires!

450
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:45,208
-This is our fate, Karmila.
-No!

451
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:48,327
<i>We must sacrifice our firstborn daughter.</i>

452
00:41:48,917 --> 00:41:50,208
<i>We don't have a choice.</i>

453
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:51,850
I have a solution.

454
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,758
For the sake of our daughter!

455
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:59,634
A couple of days later, I heard a news...

456
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:02,791
...that Mrs Karmila and her husband...

457
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:05,365
...disappeared mysteriously
in that cottage.

458
00:42:07,917 --> 00:42:11,041
That's why I was confused
when you told me...

459
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:13,041
...that there was a woman
who came over...

460
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:15,599
...and claimed to be Dinda's mother.

461
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:20,977
Before we enjoy our meals,

462
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:27,708
Dinda would like to show you something.

463
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,348
We made this all by ourselves.

464
00:43:40,708 --> 00:43:42,487
Dinda is indeed very talented.

465
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:48,605
I just taught her a little bit,
and she continued like a pro.

466
00:43:50,542 --> 00:43:51,839
I don't like it!

467
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:56,749
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

468
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:59,552
Let me talk to her. Excuse me.

469
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:05,079
Well, then. Let's eat.

470
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:07,982
Enjoy your meal.

471
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:16,156
Because you will really need it.

472
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:42,583
Ambar?

473
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,333
Ambar?

474
00:45:48,417 --> 00:45:49,511
Ambar?

475
00:46:54,542 --> 00:46:56,972
Why are these pictures kept here?

476
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:12,333
Mrs Karmila?

477
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:20,000
Are you on a diet, Panji?

478
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,542
Why don't you eat more?

479
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:26,331
I'm not on a diet.
I'm just full, that's all.

480
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:30,875
What's the matter?

481
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,351
Do you not like my cooking?

482
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:42,419
It tastes good, Ma'am. Really good.

483
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:52,693
-I need to go to the toilet.
-Aren't you scared?

484
00:49:54,333 --> 00:49:55,583
No, I'm not.

485
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,011
There's something odd about Mrs Karmila.

486
00:50:37,917 --> 00:50:40,000
I'm sure there's something weird.

487
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,833
I'm sorry if it's a little noisy.

488
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:55,458
It's okay, Ma'am.

489
00:50:55,542 --> 00:50:58,098
It's been a long time since we heard
the sound of Panji's friend.

490
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:27,042
Let me help you, Mom.

491
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,500
I'll help you too.

492
00:51:31,917 --> 00:51:33,583
No, it's okay. Just leave it there.

493
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:35,749
Panji, Kresna and Edwin,

494
00:51:35,833 --> 00:51:38,453
you should all rest in your room, okay?

495
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:43,499
-Alright, then. Let's go.
-Dinda, come here.

496
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:44,791
-Come on.
-Let's go.

497
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:46,782
You are so diligent, Dinda.

498
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:54,419
Your hair is all messed up and tangled.

499
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:57,729
Wait a minute, okay?

500
00:52:58,125 --> 00:52:59,792
Julia?

501
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,667
Ambar.

502
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:28,083
Why did you run off like that?

503
00:53:28,625 --> 00:53:31,916
Why aren't you eating?
We've all eaten our dinner, you know?

504
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,462
I don't feel like eating.

505
00:53:35,958 --> 00:53:37,542
You'll get sick, you know?

506
00:53:38,958 --> 00:53:40,278
Where's Julia?

507
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:46,284
Ambar, stop fooling around.

508
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:48,795
-I asked where's Julia.
-I don't know.

509
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:57,545
Alright, you should go to your room.
Let me look for her, okay?

510
00:53:57,629 --> 00:53:59,750
-Let's go, Ambar.
-Let's go.

511
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,293
Are you done with the dishes?

512
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,417
It's done, Mom.

513
00:54:57,708 --> 00:54:59,542
Thank you, Dear.

514
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:08,083
Let's go to bed now.

515
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:19,583
Have a seat, Dear.

516
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:31,042
Julia?

517
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:57,444
What's wrong with me?
Why don't I remember anything?

518
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:23,682
Edwin? Where's Julia?

519
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:35,602
Kresna! Panji!

520
00:56:38,375 --> 00:56:41,768
I just saw Mrs Karmila.

521
00:56:42,958 --> 00:56:44,904
Her feet didn't touch the ground.

522
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:50,124
She was floating.

523
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:52,124
-Floating?
-That's nonsense, Miko!

524
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,325
There's no way her feet
weren't on the ground.

525
00:56:58,750 --> 00:56:59,958
Kresna.

526
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:03,722
Do you remember when you were playing
with those shadow puppets?

527
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:06,917
What about it?

528
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:10,500
When you were playing
with those shadow puppets,

529
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:16,314
I saw you were being strangled
by some kind of shadow.

530
00:57:17,458 --> 00:57:18,667
What kind of shadow?

531
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,917
The shadow of...

532
00:57:24,667 --> 00:57:26,083
...a Kuntilanak.

533
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:34,374
Why didn't you tell me?

534
00:57:34,458 --> 00:57:37,333
Because...

535
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,417
-Now I remember!
-Edwin?

536
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:51,833
Hold on a second.

537
00:57:51,917 --> 00:57:54,592
Wasn't there a little girl by the window?

538
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,318
And you said...
What kind of shadow did you saw?

539
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,625
The shadow of a Kuntilanak.

540
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:07,251
What did you say
about Mrs Karmila just now?

541
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:11,749
-Her feet weren't on the ground.
-Okay.

542
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:13,167
Where is she now?

543
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:17,250
Inside her room.

544
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,416
Okay, let's go outside. Come on.

545
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,792
-Let's go outside.
-Alright.

546
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:26,416
-Hurry up!
-Come on, Ambar!

547
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,792
-Let's go!
-Go, go, go!

548
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:39,285
I'm really happy to see you, Mom.

549
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:54,874
<i>Tak lelo</i>

550
00:58:54,958 --> 00:59:01,500
<i>Lelo, lelo ledung</i>

551
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:09,083
<i>My child with a lovely face</i>

552
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,250
<i>If you cry</i>

553
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,583
-Hurry up.
-Let's go.

554
00:59:28,667 --> 00:59:30,500
Come on, hurry.

555
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:39,833
It's all in this book.

556
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,208
Let me see that.

557
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:49,667
This is it!

558
00:59:50,958 --> 00:59:52,375
These are the ones that I saw.

559
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,083
"Ponta and Ponti."

560
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:59,583
"The twin siblings who are known
to accompany demons and ghosts."

561
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:02,041
"They like dirty places and blood."

562
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:07,167
"Their appearances
are often associated..."

563
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:10,125
"...with a Kuntilanak."

564
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:14,083
Holy shit! I knew
there's something wrong with this house!

565
01:00:15,083 --> 01:00:16,583
Alright, you guys wait here.

566
01:00:16,667 --> 01:00:19,208
Let me look for Julia and Dinda, okay?

567
01:00:19,292 --> 01:00:20,879
Don't go anywhere!

568
01:00:20,963 --> 01:00:24,416
But if you guys see anything,
just run straight to the car.

569
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,500
Got it?

570
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:29,083
See? What did I tell you?

571
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,876
There's something wrong about this place!

572
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:55,914
I want to go home and be with Mommy.

573
01:00:55,998 --> 01:01:00,667
Alright, you guys have to listen
to what I say, okay? Now...

574
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:03,208
Edwin!

575
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:06,631
-Edwin!
-Edwin!

576
01:01:06,714 --> 01:01:08,375
Julia?

577
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:15,500
Julia?

578
01:01:18,792 --> 01:01:19,917
Julia?

579
01:01:20,667 --> 01:01:21,708
Julia?

580
01:01:31,917 --> 01:01:33,000
Julia?

581
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:37,209
Okay.

582
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,167
Julia?

583
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:56,459
Julia?

584
01:01:58,583 --> 01:01:59,750
Julia!

585
01:02:01,917 --> 01:02:03,083
Julia!

586
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:06,458
Hey, Julia!

587
01:02:31,542 --> 01:02:32,792
Edwin?

588
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,333
Dinda?

589
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,208
Let's get out of here.

590
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:08,458
-Where are you going?
-My body can't move!

591
01:03:09,625 --> 01:03:13,114
Didn't Dinda asked all of you
to live here?

592
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:17,092
No, Ma'am. We want to go home.

593
01:03:19,917 --> 01:03:22,085
You can't go home.

594
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:26,666
Once you step inside this house,

595
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:31,154
you will live here forever.

596
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:33,115
No!

597
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:37,250
Do you want me to show you something?

598
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:39,500
No!

599
01:03:46,667 --> 01:03:47,958
It's falling off!

600
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:50,417
What is that?

601
01:05:08,042 --> 01:05:10,694
Do you really think...

602
01:05:11,588 --> 01:05:15,834
...you can leave this place?

603
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:28,750
Where are you?

604
01:05:30,167 --> 01:05:32,939
Don't you want to play?

605
01:06:14,375 --> 01:06:17,792
Where are you?

606
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:41,042
Where do you think you're going?

607
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:50,375
Miko!

608
01:07:36,708 --> 01:07:38,041
The Kuntilanak is gone.

609
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:40,749
Come on.
This is our chance to get Dinda.

610
01:07:40,833 --> 01:07:42,208
Come on.

611
01:07:53,542 --> 01:07:55,645
Kresna.

612
01:07:58,333 --> 01:07:59,542
Kresna!

613
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:03,444
What? The Kuntilanak is already gone.

614
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:05,208
Let's go already.

615
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:12,167
-Kresna!
-Hurry, get up!

616
01:08:16,375 --> 01:08:20,167
-Where are you going?
-Let's go! Hurry!

617
01:08:21,332 --> 01:08:22,215
Come on!

618
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:23,667
Julia, wake up!

619
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:27,000
Come on, wake up. Julia!

620
01:08:30,250 --> 01:08:33,707
Julia, calm down.

621
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,124
Who is that?

622
01:08:36,207 --> 01:08:37,707
I have no idea.

623
01:08:38,917 --> 01:08:42,875
There were two little girls over there!

624
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,875
With white hairs?

625
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,459
Yes.

626
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:55,448
Right, I saw them too.

627
01:09:09,875 --> 01:09:11,957
Is it possible that Mrs Karmila is a...

628
01:09:14,375 --> 01:09:15,707
Kuntilanak?

629
01:09:17,582 --> 01:09:18,667
Yes.

630
01:09:20,457 --> 01:09:21,457
Damn!

631
01:09:21,542 --> 01:09:24,582
Okay, there's something wrong
with this house.

632
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:27,541
-We should go home, okay?
-No, wait! Ambar!

633
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:29,624
We must look for her.

634
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:32,041
Ambar is already outside, okay?

635
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:34,645
But I have no idea where Dinda is.

636
01:09:35,542 --> 01:09:37,792
We must look for her now! Come on!

637
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,917
Come on, come to hell!

638
01:09:46,042 --> 01:09:47,832
Let go of him! Come on!

639
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:50,582
Come on, come to hell!

640
01:09:52,207 --> 01:09:53,750
Let go of him! Come on!

641
01:09:53,834 --> 01:09:56,083
Let go!

642
01:09:59,583 --> 01:10:00,667
Go, go!

643
01:10:03,375 --> 01:10:04,375
Edwin!

644
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,750
Let's just hide over here.

645
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:12,375
Ambar, you should...

646
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,208
Where's Ambar?

647
01:10:14,792 --> 01:10:16,125
I don't know.

648
01:10:16,458 --> 01:10:18,708
-And what about Miko?
-I don't know!

649
01:10:18,792 --> 01:10:20,749
Miko?

650
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:22,042
Oh, my God!

651
01:12:13,583 --> 01:12:16,083
Miko!

652
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:24,916
Oh, my God! Where the hell are we?

653
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,250
Kresna.

654
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:30,376
Hold on a second. What is that?

655
01:12:31,792 --> 01:12:34,208
There are some kind of lights over there.

656
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,792
I think there's a crowd there.

657
01:12:37,083 --> 01:12:39,042
-Let's check it out.
-Okay.

658
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:01,792
Wow! What is this place, Panji?

659
01:13:06,625 --> 01:13:08,667
Kresna...

660
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:36,417
Come on, Panji.

661
01:13:58,375 --> 01:14:01,460
Kresna, what are we doing here?

662
01:14:04,375 --> 01:14:06,249
This place is really spooky.

663
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:09,041
Hurry up and ask them.
We shouldn't stay here any longer.

664
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:10,792
Alright, be patient.

665
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:23,458
Excuse me, may I ask you something?

666
01:14:27,833 --> 01:14:29,625
Come with me to hell.

667
01:14:36,125 --> 01:14:39,083
Let's go! Hurry!

668
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:41,667
Hurry up, Panji!

669
01:14:48,292 --> 01:14:49,917
Panji, back away!

670
01:15:02,458 --> 01:15:04,417
What? Why are we...

671
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:08,542
Kresna, what the hell is that?

672
01:15:15,708 --> 01:15:16,708
Dinda!

673
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:20,083
Dinda, wake up!

674
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:21,542
Come on, wake up.

675
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:25,167
Julia, Edwin? What's wrong?

676
01:15:26,375 --> 01:15:29,958
It's Mrs Karmila... She's...

677
01:15:30,042 --> 01:15:33,333
She's not what you think she is.
Edwin, tell her!

678
01:15:33,417 --> 01:15:37,291
Mrs Karmila and this entire house...

679
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:42,417
Oh, so my lovely daughter
is already awake?

680
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:45,875
Come with me, Dinda.

681
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:01,375
Ma'am.

682
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:05,658
Dinda is leaving with us right now.

683
01:16:08,542 --> 01:16:12,417
And you are going to let us leave.

684
01:16:14,667 --> 01:16:16,353
What do you mean by that?

685
01:16:16,917 --> 01:16:19,984
We already know what you really are!

686
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,354
What a temper.

687
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,500
Dinda.

688
01:16:30,542 --> 01:16:32,612
It's been a long time
since you're with me.

689
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:35,117
Don't you miss me?

690
01:16:37,792 --> 01:16:40,083
I really love you, Dear.

691
01:16:40,167 --> 01:16:43,750
No, Dinda. Don't fall for her tricks.

692
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:45,417
Come here.

693
01:16:47,125 --> 01:16:48,292
Dinda?

694
01:16:50,375 --> 01:16:51,542
Dinda?

695
01:16:57,419 --> 01:16:59,542
You dare to oppose me?

696
01:17:00,708 --> 01:17:01,875
Edwin!

697
01:17:02,792 --> 01:17:03,875
Edwin!

698
01:17:08,667 --> 01:17:09,833
Edwin!

699
01:17:26,542 --> 01:17:27,958
Dinda, run!

700
01:17:31,125 --> 01:17:32,750
Edwin!

701
01:17:34,875 --> 01:17:36,375
Come on, Dinda!

702
01:17:50,292 --> 01:17:51,458
Edwin!

703
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:00,999
Dinda, hurry!

704
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:02,791
Come on, Edwin!

705
01:18:02,875 --> 01:18:03,999
Julia, get out of here!

706
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:06,374
No! Come on, hurry!

707
01:18:06,458 --> 01:18:07,833
Get out, Julia!

708
01:18:09,208 --> 01:18:10,708
Get out!

709
01:18:11,917 --> 01:18:13,042
Let's go, Dinda.

710
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:54,796
Ambar, Kresna, Panji, Miko!

711
01:18:55,375 --> 01:18:59,653
Ambar, Kresna, Panji, Miko!

712
01:19:05,417 --> 01:19:07,196
Julia, where are the others?

713
01:19:07,708 --> 01:19:08,958
Just calm down, okay?

714
01:19:21,375 --> 01:19:24,500
-Julia, Dinda!
-Mom!

715
01:19:25,667 --> 01:19:27,386
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

716
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:29,833
Where are the others?

717
01:19:30,375 --> 01:19:32,666
-They're gone, Mom.
-Gone? Where?

718
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,029
-Where are they?
-Hold on, Mom.

719
01:19:35,667 --> 01:19:40,875
Inside that house there's a chamber
under the basement.

720
01:19:41,542 --> 01:19:43,250
I think that's her lair.

721
01:19:45,792 --> 01:19:49,469
If they were taken by the Kuntilanak,
perhaps she took them there.

722
01:19:52,458 --> 01:19:54,209
Dinda, listen to me very carefully.

723
01:19:54,667 --> 01:19:58,083
You came from the Mangkujiwo bloodline
who worships Kuntilanak.

724
01:19:58,167 --> 01:20:02,401
According to the pact, as a first born
you will be given to the Kuntilanak.

725
01:20:03,375 --> 01:20:06,686
Your late parents tried to sever
that pact.

726
01:20:07,333 --> 01:20:09,392
They tried to lock her up
and sealed her lair.

727
01:20:10,708 --> 01:20:12,639
But the Mangkujiwo family
weren't going to let that pass.

728
01:20:13,333 --> 01:20:15,921
They sent someone to free the Kuntilanak.

729
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,333
And now that creature
is coming after you.

730
01:20:19,917 --> 01:20:22,000
And she considers you
as her own daughter.

731
01:20:22,667 --> 01:20:27,417
That creature can transform
to look like your mother.

732
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:32,333
This is from your mother.

733
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:35,167
This is...

734
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:40,042
Isn't that Mrs Karmila's hairpin?

735
01:20:41,417 --> 01:20:43,696
Hairpin? Are you sure?

736
01:20:44,958 --> 01:20:46,792
It looks like a branch of a tree.

737
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:48,583
Tree?

738
01:20:49,833 --> 01:20:53,894
This hairpin is related to a tree
where the lair of Kuntilanak is.

739
01:20:54,958 --> 01:20:56,708
My mother wanted me to go there.

740
01:20:58,625 --> 01:21:03,458
Mom, Edwin is still inside.
I have to help him.

741
01:21:03,542 --> 01:21:04,542
Julia!

742
01:21:05,625 --> 01:21:08,500
You are not allowed to go there.
Let me help them instead, okay?

743
01:21:10,667 --> 01:21:11,917
Edwin!

744
01:21:12,292 --> 01:21:13,541
There's no point.

745
01:21:13,625 --> 01:21:15,416
I'm sure the Kuntilanak
will come after me.

746
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,916
And maybe my brothers and sister
are in her hands right now.

747
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,708
-I should be the one to face her.
-No, you shouldn't.

748
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:22,291
No! Let me do that!

749
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:25,958
You must hide. Go on, hide. Hurry!

750
01:21:29,042 --> 01:21:30,042
Edwin!

751
01:21:33,167 --> 01:21:34,083
Edwin!

752
01:21:52,125 --> 01:21:54,541
Mom, it's Edwin...

753
01:21:54,625 --> 01:21:56,999
He's still inside.
I can't go in there!

754
01:21:57,083 --> 01:21:58,916
Julia, please calm down.

755
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,083
Once that creature comes out,
we will burn her.

756
01:22:02,708 --> 01:22:04,708
Afterwards, we look for your brothers
and sisters.

757
01:22:04,792 --> 01:22:06,416
We must leave this place at once.

758
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,625
But...

759
01:22:08,708 --> 01:22:09,625
Edwin!

760
01:22:17,083 --> 01:22:19,750
Edwin?

761
01:22:42,667 --> 01:22:43,917
Edwin!

762
01:22:53,542 --> 01:22:57,625
Come with us to hell.

763
01:23:12,333 --> 01:23:13,917
Mrs Dona.

764
01:23:15,292 --> 01:23:16,875
You're here.

765
01:23:18,333 --> 01:23:20,000
Where is Dinda?

766
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:24,542
She's mine!

767
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:12,541
How dare you oppose me...

768
01:24:12,625 --> 01:24:14,601
...in my own house?

769
01:24:15,292 --> 01:24:20,542
Oppose me in the forest of Ujung Sedo?

770
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:25,842
You have tasted life,

771
01:24:26,874 --> 01:24:29,344
haven't you?

772
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:43,333
Listen, Dinda is hiding right now.
Find her and protect her.

773
01:24:43,417 --> 01:24:46,208
-I will face this creature.
-But, Mom...

774
01:24:46,292 --> 01:24:47,917
Just do as I say! Go!

775
01:24:52,667 --> 01:24:54,000
Dinda?

776
01:24:54,917 --> 01:24:56,496
Dinda, where are you?

777
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:58,000
Dona.

778
01:24:59,417 --> 01:25:03,208
I know what's on your mind.

779
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:14,208
I know what you wish for.

780
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:28,912
There are too many disappointments
in your heart...

781
01:25:31,208 --> 01:25:35,380
...because you are unable to fulfill
all your wishes.

782
01:26:08,917 --> 01:26:10,140
Dinda?

783
01:26:18,458 --> 01:26:22,682
I can make all your dreams come true.

784
01:26:23,583 --> 01:26:25,480
You know that, don't you?

785
01:26:44,125 --> 01:26:47,333
<i>Tak lelo</i>

786
01:26:47,417 --> 01:26:52,624
<i>Lelo, lelo ledung</i>

787
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:54,327
Where are my children?

788
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:17,833
Edwin, come to your senses!

789
01:28:20,792 --> 01:28:22,417
Do you think...

790
01:28:23,333 --> 01:28:25,475
...you are going to leave this place?

791
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,542
Edwin, come to your senses!

792
01:28:27,958 --> 01:28:29,000
No, Julia!

793
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:30,441
Edwin!

794
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:56,708
Dinda...

795
01:29:00,958 --> 01:29:02,042
Dinda.

796
01:29:02,958 --> 01:29:04,625
We are at Ujung Sedo.

797
01:29:06,167 --> 01:29:07,792
The forest of Kuntilanak.

798
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:41,375
Dinda, be careful!

799
01:29:45,958 --> 01:29:51,583
My Child, there you are.

800
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:59,708
-Watch out!
-Look out, Dinda!

801
01:30:26,958 --> 01:30:29,500
My child.

802
01:30:30,875 --> 01:30:32,208
Watch out, Dinda!

803
01:30:35,167 --> 01:30:38,458
Come here, My Dear.

804
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:43,000
Dinda!

805
01:30:46,375 --> 01:30:47,500
Dinda!

806
01:30:50,417 --> 01:30:51,667
Dinda!

807
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:53,375
Dinda!

808
01:30:57,875 --> 01:31:00,250
The strongest one is the master!

809
01:31:10,125 --> 01:31:11,542
Dinda!

810
01:31:16,917 --> 01:31:18,333
Dinda!

811
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:22,333
Dinda!

812
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:25,791
You little...

813
01:31:25,875 --> 01:31:27,499
Dinda!

814
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:30,583
-Be careful, Dinda!
-Watch out!

815
01:31:32,417 --> 01:31:34,749
-Come here!
-Dinda!

816
01:31:34,833 --> 01:31:36,875
Come here!

817
01:31:38,833 --> 01:31:40,375
Hold on, Dinda!

818
01:31:45,167 --> 01:31:46,750
Dinda!

819
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:54,875
You belong to me, Dinda!

820
01:32:03,083 --> 01:32:04,375
A heart.

821
01:32:05,250 --> 01:32:06,708
A tree.

822
01:32:14,875 --> 01:32:16,333
A heart.

823
01:32:17,542 --> 01:32:18,875
A tree.

824
01:32:50,792 --> 01:32:52,000
Dinda!

825
01:33:25,583 --> 01:33:27,708
-Dinda!
-Dinda!

826
01:34:05,625 --> 01:34:06,917
Edwin?

827
01:34:07,417 --> 01:34:08,999
-Mom!
-Edwin?

828
01:34:09,083 --> 01:34:11,125
-Edwin?
-Edwin?

829
01:34:33,208 --> 01:34:35,352
-Edwin?
-Edwin, are you okay?

830
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:42,625
Come on, Miko. Be careful.

831
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:01,833
Mom!

832
01:35:01,917 --> 01:35:04,124
Oh, my lovely children!

833
01:35:04,208 --> 01:35:06,773
-Are you guys alright?
-Mom!

834
01:35:10,958 --> 01:35:13,291
-Edwin?
-Edwin.

835
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:15,374
-Julia.
-Edwin.

836
01:35:15,458 --> 01:35:17,625
Edwin, are you okay?

837
01:36:05,208 --> 01:36:11,417
<i>Sometimes, what we are looking for
is right in front of us all along.</i>

838
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:17,374
<i>All this time, I've been searching
for my biological mother.</i>

839
01:36:17,458 --> 01:36:20,708
<i>And yet, there's someone else
who loves me more than her.</i>

840
01:36:20,792 --> 01:36:22,291
<i>It's Mrs Dona.</i>

841
01:36:22,375 --> 01:36:25,666
<i>I am grateful
that she never gave up on me,</i>

842
01:36:25,750 --> 01:36:28,493
<i>and I will love her forever.</i>

843
01:36:36,625 --> 01:36:39,791
<i>Tak lelo</i>

844
01:36:39,875 --> 01:36:45,750
<i>Lelo, lelo ledung</i>
