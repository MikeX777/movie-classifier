1
00:00:01,299 --> 00:00:04,216
(orchestral music)

2
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,170
- Kino, our people have always
been great music makers.

3
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,523
Everything you see, think,
do or hear becomes a song.

4
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,130
Just listen to it with your soul.

5
00:00:55,702 --> 00:00:58,452
(mystical music)

6
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,738
(water bubbling)

7
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,583
(ethereal music)

8
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:51,404
(water splashing)

9
00:02:33,725 --> 00:02:36,308
(serene music)

10
00:02:59,071 --> 00:03:00,567
(crickets chirping)

11
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:03,150
(Kino moaning)

12
00:03:04,533 --> 00:03:07,283
(dramatic music)

13
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,576
- Ooh!

14
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:12,159
(club banging)

15
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:20,194
(rifle booming)

16
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,251
(thunder booming)

17
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:36,680
- I saw some men in my dreams.

18
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,190
They were killed.

19
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,110
Were they the vanished ones?

20
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,077
- Your father used to dream about them.

21
00:03:43,077 --> 00:03:44,823
- But what do they want from me?

22
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,900
- Perhaps one day you will know.

23
00:03:50,444 --> 00:03:52,065
(water splashing)

24
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,051
(water bubbling)

25
00:03:55,051 --> 00:03:58,051
(adventurous music)

26
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:11,397
(seals grunting)

27
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:26,569
(water splashing)

28
00:04:29,176 --> 00:04:31,259
- Kino, you did it again.

29
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,747
- I did it again.

30
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:38,292
(dramatic music)

31
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:45,442
- Kino, you did it again.

32
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:34,858
(surf roaring)

33
00:05:44,328 --> 00:05:46,995
(water roaring)

34
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:53,169
(water dramatically splashing)

35
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:55,806
(baby fussing)

36
00:05:55,806 --> 00:05:58,389
(gentle music)

37
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:03,845
(baby crying)

38
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:07,805
- Watch, a son,

39
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:11,066
my son.

40
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:17,222
I love you both.

41
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:20,747
Coyotito.

42
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:23,587
Like my father.

43
00:06:23,587 --> 00:06:27,254
(dramatic orchestral music)

44
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:54,217
(wind chimes rattling)

45
00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:56,967
(dramatic music)

46
00:06:58,158 --> 00:07:01,224
(clubs pounding)

47
00:07:01,224 --> 00:07:03,891
(rifle banging)

48
00:07:12,352 --> 00:07:16,602
- You were having the bad
dream again, weren't you?

49
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:36,902
- When I go to sleep your eyes are open.

50
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,703
When I wake up, they're still open.

51
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,868
- I must look at through
my man all the time.

52
00:07:45,868 --> 00:07:48,451
(gentle music)

53
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,807
You didn't say good morning.

54
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:09,075
- Good morning.

55
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:21,579
(orchestral music)

56
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:34,994
(waterfowl whistling)

57
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:37,827
(rooster crowing)

58
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:43,136
(waterfowl calling)

59
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:46,343
(goat bleating)

60
00:08:46,343 --> 00:08:49,343
(chickens clucking)

61
00:09:16,462 --> 00:09:19,545
(waterfowl chirping)

62
00:09:32,668 --> 00:09:35,168
(dog whining)

63
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,550
(dramatic music)

64
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:53,837
(dog barking)

65
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,180
- What's wrong, Kino?

66
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,013
What is it?

67
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,000
- I heard the music of evil.

68
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,797
It's louder now.

69
00:10:22,316 --> 00:10:25,064
(baby crying)

70
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:25,897
- Oh God!

71
00:10:27,702 --> 00:10:28,920
(baby screaming)

72
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,587
(boot stomping)

73
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:55,061
The doctor.

74
00:10:56,632 --> 00:10:59,377
Go get the doctor, Kino.

75
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:00,827
- The doctor won't come here.

76
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,920
- Your son may die.

77
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,605
Get the doctor!

78
00:11:10,605 --> 00:11:12,663
- Juana, the doctor won't come here.

79
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:21,220
- You're his father, you're my man.

80
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,484
You bring the doctor.

81
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:24,450
Where are you going?

82
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,850
- To get the medicine woman.

83
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:29,940
- The scorpion just stung Coyotito.

84
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,473
The poison may kill my baby.

85
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,940
- Juana wants the doctor.

86
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,438
- He will not come.

87
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:42,773
- I want to (indistinct).

88
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:45,025
- Juana wants the doctor.

89
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:46,608
- He will not come.

90
00:11:47,902 --> 00:11:50,319
- The doctor won't come here.

91
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,962
- Then we'll go to him.

92
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:04,260
- Scorpion, the baby has been stung.

93
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,989
Juan and Kino are taking
him to the doctor.

94
00:12:06,989 --> 00:12:09,860
- The doctor just kills bush people.

95
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,033
He charges a lot.

96
00:12:13,346 --> 00:12:16,096
(dramatic music)

97
00:12:20,784 --> 00:12:22,117
- Scorpion bite.

98
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,850
- I have nothing better to do

99
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,780
than to cure insect
bites for little Indians?

100
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,500
I am a doctor, not the veterinarian.

101
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,290
- The father told me that
his firstborn is dying.

102
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,523
He requires the skill of the healer.

103
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,690
- Has he any money?

104
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,690
Of course not.

105
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,990
They never have any money.

106
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,250
I alone in the world and I'm
supposed to work for nothing

107
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,563
and I am tired of it.

108
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,433
Go see if he has any money.

109
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,750
- Yes, master.

110
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,420
(metal clanging)

111
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,890
- Go, tell your daughter, mother to come

112
00:13:41,064 --> 00:13:41,897
to rub my back.

113
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:49,668
(doctor mumbling)

114
00:13:52,922 --> 00:13:55,505
(bell dinging)

115
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:09,445
- Have you money to pay for the treatment?

116
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,480
- Pearls, they're as good as money.

117
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,163
- He's willing to pay
with these pearls, master.

118
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:42,671
- Ah.

119
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:45,000
(doctor chuckles)

120
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,833
Let's see.

121
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,740
Small, small, ugly,
atrocious, gray, flattened.

122
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,263
They are worthless.

123
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:11,120
Tell him I'm not here.

124
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,120
Tell him anything you like
only do not disturb me anymore.

125
00:15:26,071 --> 00:15:28,821
(metal clanging)

126
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,203
Take care of that.

127
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,590
- I have a nice little present for you.

128
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:13,340
- The doctor has gone out.

129
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,953
He was called to her serious case.

130
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:20,396
(somber music)

131
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:26,700
(door banging)

132
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,700
- Brother, I should get back to my work.

133
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:35,988
(baby crying)

134
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,150
(fist banging)

135
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,983
- Kino!

136
00:16:59,938 --> 00:17:00,855
Come, come.

137
00:17:16,249 --> 00:17:18,416
- Why did you do that for?

138
00:17:20,593 --> 00:17:23,010
- To make him feel important.

139
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,330
- You have no right to
enter the house of the Lord.

140
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,750
You live in sin.

141
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,350
- Please baptize my son, Father.

142
00:17:42,292 --> 00:17:43,932
- But you are not married.

143
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:44,765
Out!

144
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,283
- My son is gonna die.

145
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,890
Please take care of his soul.

146
00:18:09,598 --> 00:18:12,098
(baby crying)

147
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:22,688
I'll come back for his body.

148
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,823
- Wait, wait.

149
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,373
Please.

150
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,683
Have you chosen a name?

151
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,160
- Coyotito.

152
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,600
- That's no name for a Christian.

153
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,930
How about Yuan, Yuanito.

154
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:58,123
- Yuan Coyotito, I like it.

155
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,280
- Bring the child.

156
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,340
Who's going to be the godfather?

157
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,130
(baby crying)

158
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:10,943
- Juan Coyotito, what would
you ask from the church of God?

159
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,420
- True faith.

160
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,070
- What would you gain with faith?

161
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,263
- Eternal life.

162
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,560
- Juan Coyotito, I baptize you

163
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,950
in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

164
00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:31,744
Amen.

165
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,711
(shells rattling)

166
00:19:34,711 --> 00:19:37,211
(owl hooting)

167
00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:41,649
(baby crying)

168
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,277
- I think it's enough.

169
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:01,393
No swelling, no cramps, no fever so far.

170
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,203
He has to sweat the poison.

171
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,280
- Is he going to live?

172
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,113
- He may live.

173
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,307
And then again, he may not.

174
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:24,993
- Hi, Kino.

175
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:27,860
- Can I use that?

176
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,693
- Yeah.

177
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,860
- You ready?

178
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,870
- Nah, not today.

179
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,163
The water is very cold.

180
00:20:40,163 --> 00:20:42,413
That's why they came early.

181
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,870
- How's my little nephew?

182
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,120
- Much better, thank you.

183
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,560
- Today I got me a beauty.

184
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,862
I bet it's with 500.

185
00:20:56,862 --> 00:20:57,695
- Ask 800.

186
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,640
He's beautiful.

187
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,040
- Nothing wrong with asking.

188
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,940
- [Juana] Did you see Juan Tomas' pearl?

189
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,290
- Oh, yeah.

190
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:14,303
Maybe tomorrow Kino will get a good one.

191
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,873
- Bye, Silino.

192
00:21:16,873 --> 00:21:17,706
- Bless you.

193
00:21:17,706 --> 00:21:18,539
- Thank you.

194
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,593
- 500 Pesos.

195
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,230
A man can support his
family for a whole year

196
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,413
with that kind of money.

197
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,370
- Juan Tomas deserves it.

198
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,720
Your brother is a good man.

199
00:21:37,998 --> 00:21:39,348
- Well, I have to go alone.

200
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,203
- Sure.

201
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,400
Go for the sharks with that hand.

202
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:47,430
You know how blood attracts those beats.

203
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,603
- Yeah, I put this plaster on it.

204
00:21:50,572 --> 00:21:51,953
It will be dry by the time I get there.

205
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,627
- Kino, we'll go with you.

206
00:21:56,738 --> 00:21:57,821
- My Coyotito.

207
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:02,907
- Whatever happens, we are
family and we'll be together.

208
00:22:06,462 --> 00:22:09,790
(Kino whistles)

209
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,373
(gentle music)

210
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:35,618
(water splashing)

211
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:44,652
(dramatic orchestral music)

212
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,603
- Kino.

213
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,493
- I can't take that in the cave with me.

214
00:23:15,047 --> 00:23:17,880
(water splashing)

215
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:49,079
(ethereal music)

216
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:15,609
(dramatic music)

217
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:11,222
(water splashing)

218
00:26:16,854 --> 00:26:19,471
- Kino, are you all right?

219
00:26:19,471 --> 00:26:22,138
(Kino coughing)

220
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:30,963
Kino, are you all right?

221
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:35,260
Please, we have to rush,
the rain is coming.

222
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,760
- [Kino] I thought I was dead.

223
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,490
- Death will be somewhere else.

224
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,827
Even Coyotito is better now.

225
00:26:45,147 --> 00:26:47,897
(dramatic music)

226
00:26:53,993 --> 00:26:56,910
(thunder crashing)

227
00:27:01,463 --> 00:27:04,213
(men chattering)

228
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,280
- [Kino] Take him, please.

229
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,617
Juana, look what I found.

230
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,523
- [Juana] What are you going to do now

231
00:27:42,523 --> 00:27:44,650
that you are a rich man?

232
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,260
- Get married.

233
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,577
We'll marry in the church.

234
00:27:50,046 --> 00:27:52,879
(uplifting music)

235
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:04,016
I'm a rich man now.

236
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:28,334
(thunder crashing)

237
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,480
- Father, may I come in
with your holy blessing?

238
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,583
- And what brings you here?

239
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,290
- Great news.

240
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,963
Kino, the fisherman, found
the pearl of the world.

241
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,300
- Do you know this fisherman?

242
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,903
I think they call him Kino.

243
00:29:05,748 --> 00:29:09,720
- Yes, yes, he's a patient of mine.

244
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,303
I am treating his son for a scorpion bite.

245
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,613
I am pleased that he
is found a nice pearl.

246
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,363
Very poor man.

247
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,943
- Did you believe this chest
pain could be my heart?

248
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,390
- Oh, I don't think so.

249
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:35,200
(doctor coughing)

250
00:29:57,014 --> 00:30:00,181
- I damaged my lungs when I was young.

251
00:30:02,304 --> 00:30:05,363
Studying medicine in La Lorbonne.

252
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,643
- In Paris.

253
00:30:08,562 --> 00:30:10,280
- Ah, Paris.

254
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,950
Ah, Paris, Paris.

255
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,293
That was the most civilized way of living.

256
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,783
I even had a mistress.

257
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:26,383
She, she had a tragic ending.

258
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:34,193
She was a lovely young thing.

259
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:39,580
We used to go to the
opera, the art exhibitions,

260
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,963
the Cammeray, dine in
the finest restaurants,

261
00:30:46,222 --> 00:30:49,033
la cuisine Francais.

262
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,007
That will do for now.

263
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,923
- This pearl will make
us rich and set us free.

264
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,343
My son will go to school.

265
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
My son will read the book

266
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,970
and my son will write in the writing.

267
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,993
My son will make numbers and words.

268
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,200
Through him we'll know.

269
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,990
He'll become the leader of our people,

270
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,020
the one we've all been hoping for.

271
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,420
He'll break out of the
pot that holds us in.

272
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,850
This is what the pearl will do.

273
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,620
- You will get nice clothes.

274
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,323
What else?

275
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,563
- A new harpoon.

276
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,743
Why not a rifle?

277
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,210
The pearl will give me a rifle.

278
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,574
(dramatic music)

279
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:25,403
- How did you dare to
go to the outer reef?

280
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,273
- I heard the music of the
pearl, I just followed.

281
00:32:32,466 --> 00:32:33,597
- How much is it to compare its worth?

282
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,233
- I don't know.

283
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,783
Juan Tomas, what did you get for yours?

284
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,670
- They wouldn't pay my price.

285
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,093
I got very upset.

286
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,960
I gave my pearl to the priest.

287
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,037
- God bless you.

288
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,693
- He's gonna send it to the Pope.

289
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,583
- Dr. Karl.

290
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,520
- Good evening, father.

291
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:23,493
You look surprised.

292
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,290
- You never visit the house of the Lord.

293
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:32,090
- Oh, well, lately I have been wondering

294
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,480
about my eternal rest.

295
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,713
- [Priest] As you should.

296
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:43,290
- My dearly beloved
departed wife paid you money

297
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,793
for losses in her memory in perpetuity.

298
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,930
I should like to do the same.

299
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:53,930
- Your wife was a very
virtuous lady and generous.

300
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:55,923
- And wealthy.

301
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:01,563
I'm sure you got her
first-class accommodation.

302
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,043
Perhaps, perhaps for
acknowledging how mean,

303
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,003
selfish she was.

304
00:34:12,821 --> 00:34:15,573
Nevertheless, I would like
to join her there one day.

305
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:20,010
- That's a good thought, but
if you want to go to heaven,

306
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:24,200
you should practice Christian
virtuous like charity.

307
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,713
- Now we're talking.

308
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:31,783
How much?

309
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,943
- Heaven is not for sale.

310
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,463
- How much do I pay for eternal rest?

311
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,473
- Not pay, give.

312
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:50,340
- Oh, could you give me some
idea how much I should give?

313
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,610
- Memorial masses in
perpetuity are more expensive

314
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,923
than they were 20 years ago.

315
00:35:03,697 --> 00:35:07,607
- Oh, you mean 20 years makes
a difference in eternity?

316
00:35:12,357 --> 00:35:13,357
Hmm, Father?

317
00:35:20,842 --> 00:35:23,342
I believe the fisherman
brought you a pearl today.

318
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,453
I am sure that you would
prefer to have the money.

319
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,933
How much?

320
00:35:33,136 --> 00:35:35,886
(dramatic music)

321
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,163
- 50 pesos.

322
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,373
- 50 pesos.

323
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:49,239
(dog barking)

324
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:28,020
- Kino, the doctor, the doctor is coming.

325
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,720
- I was not home when
you called this morning,

326
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,963
but now the first chance
I've come to see the baby.

327
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:55,500
- The baby is nearly well now.

328
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,257
- Oh, sometimes my friend,

329
00:36:59,257 --> 00:37:02,230
the scorpion sting can
have a curious effect.

330
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,340
There will be apparent improvement,

331
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,243
but then without warning, death follows.

332
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,003
Sometimes there could be the withered leg.

333
00:37:38,601 --> 00:37:40,563
Or a blind eye, crooked back.

334
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:46,013
Yes, I know the sting of
the scorpion, my friend,

335
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:47,870
and I can cure it.

336
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:10,135
High, high, high, yes, yes.

337
00:38:12,547 --> 00:38:15,380
(doctor mumbling)

338
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,923
There we go, look.

339
00:38:29,964 --> 00:38:32,910
(doctor babbling)

340
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:36,330
Yes, just as I thought, just as I thought,

341
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:40,727
the poison is inward, it
will strike soon, yes, yes.

342
00:38:44,056 --> 00:38:44,889
Come.

343
00:38:45,903 --> 00:38:49,320
(doctor singing to baby)

344
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,270
You see, you see the eye?

345
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,700
It's blue.

346
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,533
Look, blue.

347
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:02,523
I will give him something to
try and turn the poison aside.

348
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,213
Good.

349
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,130
Good boy, good boy.

350
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:17,188
Yes, yes, I'll take care of you.

351
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,938
(dramatic music)

352
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,472
Yes, come, come, look.

353
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:50,067
(doctor babbling)

354
00:39:52,825 --> 00:39:54,903
No, no, I know you don't want to.

355
00:39:54,903 --> 00:39:57,403
(baby crying)

356
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,447
I think the poison was
just about to strike,

357
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:10,743
but the medicine should
save the baby from any harm.

358
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:17,383
You know, perhaps I just arrived
in time to save the baby.

359
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:27,820
Oh yes, when do you think
you'll be able to pay the bill?

360
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,100
- When I've sold my pearl, I'll pay you.

361
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,870
- Oh, you have a pearl?

362
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:41,370
Is it a good pearl?

363
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,270
- He has found the pearl of the world.

364
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:51,513
- Kino found a pearl like
nobody has ever seen.

365
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,133
- Kino is a rich man now.

366
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,660
- I've never heard of it.

367
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,543
- Tomorrow I'll sell it and I'll pay you.

368
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:04,963
- Could I see it?

369
00:41:16,395 --> 00:41:19,145
(ethereal music)

370
00:41:34,879 --> 00:41:35,930
It would be a shame, my friend,

371
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,030
if it was stolen before you could sell it.

372
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,223
Perhaps you would like
me to put it in my safe.

373
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,807
- It's safe here.

374
00:41:47,807 --> 00:41:48,640
- Here?

375
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,010
Well, even I with an
untrained eye would notice

376
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,833
if you had dug a hole in the floor.

377
00:41:54,904 --> 00:41:57,654
(dramatic music)

378
00:42:03,657 --> 00:42:06,633
(baby crying)

379
00:42:06,633 --> 00:42:08,309
- Coyotito!

380
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:09,142
Get out!

381
00:42:20,197 --> 00:42:22,614
- The poison started to work.

382
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,123
I can defeated it.

383
00:42:27,123 --> 00:42:28,780
I will try my best.

384
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,013
- Please, we will give you anything.

385
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:33,863
- Anything?

386
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:38,743
If I save your baby's life,
you will give me anything?

387
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,110
What about the pearl?

388
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,333
- Kino.

389
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,633
- I know you charge five pesos.

390
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:55,720
In front of these witnesses
I say I'll pay you 10

391
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,773
if you say my son.

392
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,327
- You are not gonna let him die, are you?

393
00:43:40,153 --> 00:43:42,820
(calming music)

394
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,167
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

395
00:43:51,084 --> 00:43:53,584
That's it, very well, come on.

396
00:43:56,663 --> 00:43:57,496
Come on.

397
00:43:59,752 --> 00:44:01,169
Here we are, yes.

398
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,773
He will be all right now.

399
00:44:36,162 --> 00:44:37,912
I have won the fight.

400
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:45,573
Pay attention.

401
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,120
Tomorrow Kino will bring
the pearl to one of you.

402
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:58,630
I don't want another mishap
like we had today with Carmelo,

403
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:59,530
do you understand?

404
00:45:00,827 --> 00:45:02,200
- Juan Tomas wanted 500.

405
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,080
I pass thinking he would come back.

406
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,097
- You thought he did come back,

407
00:45:07,097 --> 00:45:09,833
but he did not come back, you idiot.

408
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:12,793
- I offer 150.

409
00:45:13,784 --> 00:45:15,873
That pearl was not worth more than 1,500.

410
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,470
- I went as high as 200.

411
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:21,750
He got mad.

412
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:22,633
- He got mad.

413
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:26,890
He got mad and he went to the priest.

414
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,260
- That's his loss.

415
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,800
- His loss should be my gain.

416
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,760
- Tomorrow I will go, buy
the pearl from the priest

417
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,760
and bring it to you.

418
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,673
- I have already bought it.

419
00:45:46,467 --> 00:45:50,010
- The priest brought it to
me and I gave him 20 pesos.

420
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,203
(men laughing)

421
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:01,258
(hand banging)

422
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,723
- What is all this commotion about?

423
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:12,713
What do you want?

424
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,220
- I want my pearl back.

425
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,710
The Pope will be much happier with Kino's.

426
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:21,320
- You gave it away for charity.

427
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,233
- I was angry.

428
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:24,800
I'm a poor man.

429
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,813
- I cannot give you back property
of the holy mother church.

430
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,653
- We cannot push these people too far.

431
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:47,961
We got to try to keep them happy.

432
00:46:47,961 --> 00:46:50,544
(men laughing)

433
00:46:51,945 --> 00:46:53,583
- Kino's pearl is another matter.

434
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:57,550
I was told it's the biggest pearl

435
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:59,940
ever found in these waters.

436
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,223
I don't know how much it is worth.

437
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:04,903
- I do.

438
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:10,030
I have seen it and I want it.

439
00:47:12,841 --> 00:47:15,591
(dramatic music)

440
00:47:19,881 --> 00:47:22,631
(metal scraping)

441
00:47:50,317 --> 00:47:52,817
(dog barking)

442
00:48:08,731 --> 00:48:11,481
(metal scraping)

443
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:26,945
- Who do you fear, Kino?

444
00:48:30,468 --> 00:48:31,385
- Everyone.

445
00:48:37,644 --> 00:48:40,394
(romantic music)

446
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,220
- I hope you didn't buy anything.

447
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:33,293
- We have credit now, here, look, look.

448
00:49:34,978 --> 00:49:36,061
For Coyotito.

449
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,767
(both laughing)

450
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:42,743
- How about you?

451
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,297
- This hat and new shirt, new pants and.

452
00:49:51,334 --> 00:49:52,167
- And?

453
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,033
- New dress.

454
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,453
- Thank you.

455
00:49:59,973 --> 00:50:00,806
- And this shawl.

456
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:03,463
It's made of silk.

457
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:11,340
And shoes.

458
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,253
- Shoes.

459
00:50:15,197 --> 00:50:16,072
Shoes.

460
00:50:16,072 --> 00:50:18,322
(laughing)

461
00:50:19,372 --> 00:50:20,205
Shoes.

462
00:50:20,205 --> 00:50:23,372
(church bell dinging)

463
00:50:40,043 --> 00:50:40,876
- They are coming.

464
00:50:40,876 --> 00:50:43,000
They have chosen to deal with you first.

465
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,800
I wouldn't be back later.

466
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,793
Oh, remember, be nice.

467
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:04,120
- You must be very careful
to see they do not cheat you.

468
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:04,953
- Very careful.

469
00:51:08,468 --> 00:51:09,360
- How can we know what is a fair price

470
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,540
if we don't know what the pearl buyer gets

471
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:12,980
with the pearl in another place?

472
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,830
- That's true, how can we
know, we're here and not there.

473
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:24,513
- Good morning, my friend, come in.

474
00:51:26,457 --> 00:51:27,290
Please come in.

475
00:51:41,409 --> 00:51:43,242
What can I do for you?

476
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,770
- I have a pearl.

477
00:51:52,661 --> 00:51:53,910
(laughing)

478
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,510
- You have a pearl, huh?

479
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:59,853
Sometimes a man brings in a dozen.

480
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:03,970
Well, where's your pearl?

481
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:06,220
We will value it and
give you the best price.

482
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,113
- Yes.

483
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:18,020
(ethereal music)

484
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,393
- No price have been mentioned yet.

485
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:58,440
(dramatic music)

486
00:53:03,878 --> 00:53:04,961
- I am sorry.

487
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,340
- This is a pearl of great value.

488
00:53:14,801 --> 00:53:16,213
- You have heard of fool's gold?

489
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,883
This pearl is like fool's gold.

490
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,150
It's too large.

491
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:23,520
Who will buy it?

492
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,513
There's no market for such a thing.

493
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:30,620
You thought it was a thing of value

494
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,163
and it is only a curiosity.

495
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,093
I am sorry.

496
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:39,450
- This is the pearl of the world.

497
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,383
No one has ever seen such a pearl.

498
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:43,974
- From the country.

499
00:53:43,974 --> 00:53:46,320
It is large and clumsy.

500
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,120
How can you find the to match?

501
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,910
Let's say for earrings.

502
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:51,253
Ladies have two ears.

503
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:55,383
It will look horrible on
a ring like a seagull say.

504
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:11,073
I can give you say 1,000 pesos.

505
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:15,883
- It's worth 50 times as much.

506
00:54:16,930 --> 00:54:18,947
- 50,000 pesos?

507
00:54:21,917 --> 00:54:24,004
50,000 pesos.

508
00:54:24,004 --> 00:54:25,473
- You know it.

509
00:54:25,473 --> 00:54:26,723
- 50,000 pesos.

510
00:54:27,708 --> 00:54:29,113
- 50,000 pesos.

511
00:54:29,113 --> 00:54:30,873
- 50,000 pesos.

512
00:54:30,873 --> 00:54:31,915
- That's too much.

513
00:54:31,915 --> 00:54:32,765
- A lot of money.

514
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:34,940
- You wanna cheat me.

515
00:54:36,955 --> 00:54:37,890
- No, no, do not blame me.

516
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,273
I am only an appraiser.

517
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:44,373
Ask the others, go to the
Ruffess's, show your pearl.

518
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,950
Or better yet, I'll have
another to come here

519
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:50,883
so that you see that
there is no collusion.

520
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:53,543
Wait.

521
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:09,490
- I don't like it.

522
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:13,333
Your pearl is big, but kind of gray.

523
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,073
You better sell.

524
00:55:16,073 --> 00:55:19,050
- 1,000 pesos is lot of money.

525
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,820
Don't be a really fool like Juan Tomas.

526
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:26,323
He has to work a year to get
back what he lost yesterday.

527
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:30,393
- That is not your business.

528
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,427
- What do you think?

529
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,920
- No pearl diver lives to be 50.

530
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:47,540
50 doesn't seem a lot to ask.

531
00:55:52,676 --> 00:55:53,910
- Here they come.

532
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,963
- I hae put a value on this pearl.

533
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:59,703
The owner here does not think it's fair.

534
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:04,973
I will ask you to examine this
thing and to make an offer.

535
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:11,073
Notice, I have not mentioned
what I have offered.

536
00:56:12,929 --> 00:56:16,262
(horse hooves clicking)

537
00:56:18,407 --> 00:56:21,157
(dramatic music)

538
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:30,593
- One of my clients I search I think.

539
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:33,140
I will offer a 500 pesos.

540
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,793
Perhaps I can sell it
to my client for 600.

541
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:43,039
It is a monstrosity.

542
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:44,263
- You see?

543
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,180
- What a stroke of luck.

544
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,393
Here comes a professor.

545
00:56:59,977 --> 00:57:03,160
Professor Costas, the geologist.

546
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,873
He's an authority in this field.

547
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:08,543
- Ladies, gentlemen.

548
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:15,420
The news of your pearl brought me here.

549
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:17,913
Can I see it?

550
00:57:24,697 --> 00:57:26,114
Very interesting.

551
00:57:29,998 --> 00:57:31,248
Very big piece.

552
00:57:33,475 --> 00:57:36,058
(gentle music)

553
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:38,517
One of a kind.

554
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:46,512
Very odd-looking.

555
00:57:49,789 --> 00:57:50,706
Incredible.

556
00:57:53,985 --> 00:57:55,887
- How much is it worth?

557
00:57:55,887 --> 00:57:57,513
- How much is it worth?

558
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:02,493
I'm not talking about
the commercial value.

559
00:58:04,321 --> 00:58:05,540
I would probably sell it to a museum

560
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:08,283
for display with my seashell collection.

561
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:12,043
- How much?

562
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:18,340
- I'm a fool, but my
first offer still stands.

563
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,373
- I'll give you 500 at the most.

564
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,930
- You said it was incredible.

565
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:28,763
- Yes.

566
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:31,780
Can I have the pearl?

567
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,230
Better pearls are made out of paste

568
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:39,973
and I know about these things.

569
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,240
Let me show you what I mean.

570
00:58:44,134 --> 00:58:46,884
You see it's soft and chalky
here, see it for yourself.

571
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:49,793
It looses color.

572
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:59,263
Bouncing crevices all over.

573
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:05,560
However, I'll gave you 750 pesos.

574
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:12,230
- I'm being cheated.

575
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:15,270
My pearl is not for sale here.

576
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:18,270
I'll go perhaps even to the capitol.

577
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:19,833
- I'll raise it up to 1,200.

578
00:59:21,844 --> 00:59:22,677
- Hey, Hey, Hey!

579
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:24,540
I'll give you 2,000.

580
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,980
- Some say they stole the pearls.

581
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,253
- Yeah, the vanished ones.

582
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:51,590
- What do you want?

583
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:55,193
- I want to buy passage to the mainland.

584
00:59:56,611 --> 00:59:58,420
- It'll cost you 10 pesos.

585
00:59:58,420 --> 00:59:59,820
- Can I have credit on the fair?

586
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:01,453
I need to sell my pearl.

587
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,767
- Have you ever been to the mainland?

588
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,650
Do you know where to sell your pearl?

589
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:10,430
- My pearl's worth a
fortune in the mainland.

590
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:15,230
- Oh, well, between you and your fortune

591
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,473
lies 100 miles of open sea.

592
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,400
- Then I'll go in my canoe.

593
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,233
- A canoe.

594
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:24,600
You'd never make it in a canoe.

595
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,300
- My great-grandfather came in it.

596
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,113
- I made that too once.

597
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:31,900
I'll go with you.

598
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,220
- You fools, you'll drown out there.

599
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:35,430
You'll have the wind,

600
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:37,453
the sea and the currents against you.

601
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:41,740
- Right here we have your
castillings against us.

602
01:00:45,033 --> 01:00:47,616
(serene music)

603
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,540
- Juana, what's wrong?

604
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:19,093
- It's Slavino.

605
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,433
He fell into a ravine.

606
01:01:25,870 --> 01:01:26,703
He's dead.

607
01:01:32,425 --> 01:01:35,008
(women crying)

608
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,510
- No one legged man takes
it downhill shortcut

609
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:50,983
carrying a box of tools.

610
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:56,437
He was pushed from here.

611
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:01,310
- Hail Mary full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

612
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:03,060
Blessed art thou amongst women

613
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:06,452
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

614
01:02:06,452 --> 01:02:08,850
(crowd mumbling prayers)

615
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:09,900
- It was an accident.

616
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:15,403
- Somebody wanted to prevent
Slavion from helping Kino.

617
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:18,923
- Then they would have
attacked Kino instead.

618
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:22,310
- Kino was not alone.

619
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:24,993
- Besides, the pearl has little value.

620
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:28,910
Those dealers didn't discuss
the matter among themselves.

621
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:31,410
All of them, even the
professor know that pearl

622
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:34,053
is a freak, a monstrosity.

623
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:37,493
- Suppose they had arranged it before.

624
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,763
- If that's true,

625
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,540
then all of us have been
cheated all of our lives.

626
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:04,937
- Kino, I would like to
have a word with you.

627
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,410
- These men are my friends.

628
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:17,670
- Kino, you are named after a great man

629
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:20,870
and a great father of
the church who's namesake

630
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:24,830
tamed the desert and made
Christians of you people.

631
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:26,530
Did you know that?

632
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:27,880
- Father Kino, yes, I know.

633
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:31,403
- What you did today was against religion.

634
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:36,700
Great calamities will fall
on the rebellious ones.

635
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:39,690
Each man and woman is
like a soldier sent by God

636
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:42,550
to guard some parts of the
castle of the universe.

637
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:45,840
Some are in the ramparts and
some far deep into darkness

638
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:49,320
of the walls, but each
one must remain faithful

639
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,470
to their post.

640
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:52,640
They must not go running about,

641
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,053
else the castle is in danger
from the assaults of hell.

642
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,193
- Is it a sin to sell my
pearl for a better price?

643
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:02,833
- I'm afraid for you.

644
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:07,160
- What have I to fear but starvation?

645
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,550
- Go with God then.

646
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:33,143
- No one dares to speak like that.

647
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,103
- Kino is a brave man.

648
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:44,833
- Who wants to take the trip
with me and share my fate?

649
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:50,080
- I would go, but I have four children.

650
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:55,080
Abalonia, Juana, Coyotito,
who would look after them?

651
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:57,073
- I am not a seaman.

652
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:00,753
- I hate water.

653
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:07,630
- I'm sorry, even I value my poor life

654
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,653
above your chances of success.

655
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,363
- I can't go alone.

656
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:19,680
I need someone to sail with me.

657
01:05:21,613 --> 01:05:22,453
- I'll go with you.

658
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,090
I'll share your fate.

659
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:28,313
- Juana, you are a woman with the baby.

660
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:34,070
- We are his family.

661
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:40,523
My man won't cross 100
miles of ocean alone.

662
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:43,393
- [Kino] We'll discuss it in the morning.

663
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:46,493
- Goodnight.

664
01:05:51,092 --> 01:05:53,842
(dramatic music)

665
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:05,527
- Tatiana, now you're a widow.

666
01:06:05,527 --> 01:06:08,663
Now you have no house,
no worldly possessions.

667
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:12,890
Now your brothers and
sisters will provide for you.

668
01:06:21,224 --> 01:06:26,031
♪ Bye-bye little brown sparrow ♪

669
01:06:26,031 --> 01:06:29,779
♪ Sleep tight ♪

670
01:06:29,779 --> 01:06:34,779
♪ Bye-bye little brown sparrow ♪

671
01:06:37,386 --> 01:06:41,838
♪ Sleep tight little brown sparrow ♪

672
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:45,088
♪ Sleep tight, bye-bye ♪

673
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:47,917
- Do you hear that?

674
01:06:50,321 --> 01:06:53,154
- Yes, it's the song of the enemy.

675
01:06:54,633 --> 01:06:57,047
I try to overpower it with my singing,

676
01:06:57,047 --> 01:06:59,130
but it's still out there.

677
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,607
(clubs banging)

678
01:07:28,916 --> 01:07:29,749
Kino!

679
01:07:31,593 --> 01:07:32,760
Somebody help!

680
01:07:43,858 --> 01:07:46,441
(solemn music)

681
01:08:05,884 --> 01:08:08,717
(shells rattling)

682
01:08:10,182 --> 01:08:12,350
(dramatic music)

683
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:15,883
- We are all as guests
to the battle of life.

684
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:21,470
We arrive and claim our place and in peace

685
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:23,133
we partake and enjoy.

686
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:27,680
When our time comes,
another guest will come

687
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:32,390
to take our place to continue the feast,

688
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:33,617
to partake and enjoy.

689
01:08:38,054 --> 01:08:40,887
(shells rattling)

690
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,090
- Kino, listen to me.

691
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:51,490
The pearl is evil.

692
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,910
Let's destroy it before it destroys us.

693
01:08:56,052 --> 01:08:58,113
Let's crush it between two stones.

694
01:08:59,451 --> 01:09:02,443
Let's throw it into the
sea back where it belongs.

695
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:05,713
Kino, it is evil.

696
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:08,109
- No, no.

697
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:10,880
I'll fight this thing.

698
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:13,513
I'll win over it.

699
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,423
No one will take our good
fortune away from us.

700
01:09:21,421 --> 01:09:23,504
Believe me, I'm your man.

701
01:09:28,132 --> 01:09:30,215
- Any man can get killed.

702
01:09:31,576 --> 01:09:33,993
- We'll leave at first light.

703
01:09:39,257 --> 01:09:40,907
Are you not afraid to go with me?

704
01:09:43,436 --> 01:09:45,019
- Yes, I am, still.

705
01:09:52,162 --> 01:09:54,912
(fire crackling)

706
01:10:05,803 --> 01:10:08,553
(dramatic music)

707
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:28,069
(waves crashing)

708
01:10:32,223 --> 01:10:34,890
(hand slapping)

709
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,640
- The pearl is gone!

710
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:47,833
- It's not gone, through there.

711
01:10:48,755 --> 01:10:50,005
Can you see it?

712
01:10:53,334 --> 01:10:54,593
- What are you doing?

713
01:10:54,593 --> 01:10:55,426
- Hold my sash.

714
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:27,363
- Kino, I'm so afraid.

715
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:36,650
- Hush, don't speak now.

716
01:11:38,842 --> 01:11:41,342
(ax pounding)

717
01:11:57,933 --> 01:12:00,683
(metal clanking)

718
01:12:11,634 --> 01:12:14,217
(solemn music)

719
01:12:34,484 --> 01:12:37,364
(people yelling)

720
01:12:37,364 --> 01:12:40,662
(dramatic music)

721
01:12:40,662 --> 01:12:43,329
(woman yelling)

722
01:12:46,747 --> 01:12:49,497
(fire crackling)

723
01:13:03,086 --> 01:13:05,669
(Juana crying)

724
01:13:29,681 --> 01:13:33,050
(hopeful music)

725
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:34,573
- I heard your baby cry.

726
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,197
- Did you see who's done this?

727
01:13:45,197 --> 01:13:46,530
- The evil ones.

728
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:05,120
(dramatic music)

729
01:14:12,577 --> 01:14:15,327
(metal slashing)

730
01:14:53,207 --> 01:14:54,694
(owl hooting)

731
01:14:54,694 --> 01:14:56,027
- It's time now.

732
01:14:57,329 --> 01:15:00,329
(crickets chirping)

733
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:04,433
Where you go?

734
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:07,813
- To the north.

735
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,860
I heard there's villages in the north.

736
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:13,840
How far, I don't know.

737
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:14,740
- Avoid the shore.

738
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:18,830
The evil ones are organizing
a search party for you there.

739
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:21,018
Do you still have the pearl?

740
01:15:21,018 --> 01:15:22,827
- I have it.

741
01:15:22,827 --> 01:15:24,870
- There's a devil in this pearl.

742
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:27,213
You should've sold it
and passed on the spirit.

743
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:31,060
Perhaps when you sell it, you
could buy peace for yourself.

744
01:15:33,415 --> 01:15:34,565
- It belongs to my son.

745
01:15:40,738 --> 01:15:44,405
- The wind is strong,
there'll be no tracks.

746
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:46,540
Your ancestors guide you.

747
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:08,250
(serious music)

748
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:11,567
My brother, I may never see you again.

749
01:16:32,885 --> 01:16:35,385
(dog barking)

750
01:16:53,207 --> 01:16:55,863
- Goodnight, doctor, I have
to leave early in the morning.

751
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:07,643
- It was a great mistake, them
bringing that child to me.

752
01:17:11,339 --> 01:17:14,157
- Then again, it's just a matter of time.

753
01:17:18,067 --> 01:17:20,817
(dramatic music)

754
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,243
- I'm sad to see a man down on his luck.

755
01:17:53,463 --> 01:17:56,046
(man mumbling)

756
01:18:03,096 --> 01:18:07,263
- But now, Kino's free his
first time in his life.

757
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:01,420
(frogs chirping)

758
01:19:02,427 --> 01:19:05,010
(baby crying)

759
01:20:27,299 --> 01:20:30,132
(animal growling)

760
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:42,060
(baby crying)

761
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:54,193
- Master, master.

762
01:20:56,612 --> 01:20:57,520
- What?

763
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,353
- Master.

764
01:20:58,353 --> 01:20:59,413
- What is the news?

765
01:21:00,708 --> 01:21:02,520
- Our people couldn't find Kino.

766
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,673
No one wants to continue the search.

767
01:21:06,513 --> 01:21:07,370
- Huh?

768
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:09,303
- They feel the power of the pearl.

769
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:12,320
It helped the fishermen to kill three men.

770
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:17,433
- Nonsense. Go on, get out of here.

771
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,513
Bring me more cognac.

772
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:40,883
- Yes, master.

773
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:51,143
- That stupid Kino.

774
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:03,320
He has in the palm of
his hand my retirement,

775
01:22:05,210 --> 01:22:07,853
my ticket to Paris, my future.

776
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:15,170
I don't want to die in
this filthy, ugly village.

777
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,990
I'll be 70 soon

778
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,883
and my debt to justice by now
is too old to be remembered.

779
01:22:28,054 --> 01:22:32,787
Whey, even I, sometimes
even I forget her name.

780
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:38,013
Marie Clair.

781
01:22:40,609 --> 01:22:41,609
Marie Clair.

782
01:22:43,598 --> 01:22:45,063
Oh, Marie Clair.

783
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,093
Have you forgiven me?

784
01:22:50,670 --> 01:22:51,820
- I know what you mean.

785
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:01,503
But I'll help you get Kino.

786
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:05,360
Nobody knows these
mountains better than I do.

787
01:23:10,647 --> 01:23:12,113
- Why should I trust you?

788
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:19,763
- Because I'm going to be
the new doctor in town.

789
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:23,803
- You're no physician.

790
01:23:25,337 --> 01:23:27,650
- Neither are you for that matter.

791
01:23:27,650 --> 01:23:29,940
- I am Dr. Karl Gowlee.

792
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:31,653
- That's not your real name.

793
01:23:32,730 --> 01:23:36,282
A real doctor who have never
settled in this forsaken place.

794
01:23:36,282 --> 01:23:37,400
- You filthy liar.

795
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:40,273
Look, go over there, my
diploma from La Lorbonne.

796
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:42,413
- I notice it.

797
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:49,763
But, let me remind you
that I speak French.

798
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:56,330
And this diploma was issued 80 years ago.

799
01:23:57,690 --> 01:24:02,333
So you were what at the time, 20, 25?

800
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:05,043
Are you 100 years old now?

801
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:14,620
When you go, I want you
to give me your diploma.

802
01:24:15,583 --> 01:24:18,416
(doctor laughing)

803
01:24:19,861 --> 01:24:20,778
Your house.

804
01:24:25,307 --> 01:24:26,224
Your books.

805
01:24:31,755 --> 01:24:32,922
Your servants.

806
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:40,903
Your practice.

807
01:24:45,070 --> 01:24:49,553
- So you will be the doctor?

808
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:57,143
- Is that a deal?

809
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:14,613
- Just get me the pearl.

810
01:25:21,202 --> 01:25:23,952
(dramatic music)

811
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:01,193
- Hey, stop!

812
01:26:08,347 --> 01:26:09,925
Get back there.

813
01:26:09,925 --> 01:26:12,427
Get back there, go on.

814
01:26:12,427 --> 01:26:14,177
Get outta here, move.

815
01:26:16,893 --> 01:26:19,476
(man groaning)

816
01:26:37,812 --> 01:26:38,645
Go.

817
01:26:50,423 --> 01:26:53,173
(horse neighing)

818
01:27:07,475 --> 01:27:10,142
(Juana hooting)

819
01:27:40,751 --> 01:27:43,251
(owl hooting)

820
01:28:16,607 --> 01:28:17,524
- Trackers.

821
01:28:23,730 --> 01:28:25,373
Maybe I should let them take me.

822
01:28:27,172 --> 01:28:28,450
- You have the pearl.

823
01:28:28,450 --> 01:28:30,120
Do you think they will take your back

824
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:31,570
to say that you've stolen it?

825
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:33,710
- But you'll be safe.

826
01:28:34,990 --> 01:28:36,910
- You think they'll let me live?

827
01:28:36,910 --> 01:28:39,433
Do you think that they'll
let the little one here live?

828
01:28:44,947 --> 01:28:48,447
- Maybe we can lose them in the mountains.

829
01:28:52,728 --> 01:28:55,311
(solemn music)

830
01:29:28,003 --> 01:29:30,753
(dramatic music)

831
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:34,492
- They won't be long.

832
01:30:09,986 --> 01:30:12,486
(baby crying)

833
01:30:23,535 --> 01:30:25,618
- We'll sleep over there.

834
01:31:22,794 --> 01:31:25,294
(man yelling)

835
01:31:30,616 --> 01:31:33,699
- Get up, get up, get going, come on.

836
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:51,213
- How far?

837
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:57,313
- They'll be here in an hour, perhaps two.

838
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,203
- Good, have your breakfast.

839
01:33:04,590 --> 01:33:09,143
- Juana, I'll go on and you'll hide.

840
01:33:10,130 --> 01:33:11,260
I'll lead them into the mountains.

841
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:13,320
When they've gone past, you go north

842
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:14,610
and I'll catch up with you.

843
01:33:14,610 --> 01:33:15,703
You take the pearl.

844
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:18,410
It's the only safe way.

845
01:33:18,410 --> 01:33:20,223
- No, we go with you.

846
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:23,390
- I can go faster alone.

847
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:26,260
You put the baby in more
danger if you go with me.

848
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:27,093
- No.

849
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:29,600
- Why not?

850
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:32,623
It's the wisest thing and it's my wish.

851
01:33:33,830 --> 01:33:34,663
- No.

852
01:33:45,270 --> 01:33:46,103
- Sorry.

853
01:33:57,260 --> 01:34:02,260
- Now, Kino, all I have to
do is follow the poachers.

854
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:34,583
(rifle booms)

855
01:35:05,190 --> 01:35:10,190
- Look, Coyotito, that's a jackrabbit.

856
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:16,313
A snake.

857
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:22,633
And that's your namesake, the coyote.

858
01:35:28,845 --> 01:35:29,945
And the mountain lion.

859
01:35:37,890 --> 01:35:39,223
There's water over there.

860
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:41,650
- How do you know?

861
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:44,830
- These tracks are from last night.

862
01:35:45,950 --> 01:35:47,540
That's where they all go to drink.

863
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:48,720
- Are you sure?

864
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:49,823
- Yes, we are sure.

865
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:53,843
Tell your mother we are sure, Coyotito.

866
01:35:56,464 --> 01:35:57,381
- Let's go.

867
01:36:09,556 --> 01:36:12,389
(cicadas buzzing)

868
01:36:46,176 --> 01:36:47,509
- Leave me here.

869
01:36:49,191 --> 01:36:50,441
I cannot go on.

870
01:36:52,511 --> 01:36:55,594
My feet, I'm gonna get tracker blood.

871
01:37:18,225 --> 01:37:19,142
We're lost.

872
01:37:20,043 --> 01:37:21,870
- We're not lost.

873
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:23,320
- They're showing us the way.

874
01:37:26,452 --> 01:37:27,477
Can't you see 'em?

875
01:37:27,477 --> 01:37:28,760
The vanished ones.

876
01:37:30,752 --> 01:37:32,835
They'll lead us to water.

877
01:37:42,175 --> 01:37:44,882
(water roaring)

878
01:37:44,882 --> 01:37:47,549
(hopeful music)

879
01:38:04,187 --> 01:38:06,937
(dramatic music)

880
01:38:08,035 --> 01:38:08,868
- Go.

881
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:42,400
(rifle booms)

882
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:51,733
- Juana, I found water.

883
01:38:54,448 --> 01:38:55,370
- Where is it?

884
01:38:55,370 --> 01:38:56,203
Give it to me.

885
01:38:57,850 --> 01:39:00,230
- Those men are between us and the water.

886
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,740
- It looks bad and my breasts are dry.

887
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:07,677
What are we going to do?

888
01:39:10,970 --> 01:39:13,020
- We'll find shelter before it gets dark.

889
01:39:14,907 --> 01:39:17,490
(solemn music)

890
01:39:41,831 --> 01:39:44,581
(dramatic music)

891
01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:20,420
- What does this mean, Kino?

892
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:21,357
Who were these men?

893
01:40:21,357 --> 01:40:22,383
- The vanished ones.

894
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Our elders sent them to sell the pearls.

895
01:40:30,620 --> 01:40:31,770
Now we know their fate.

896
01:40:38,881 --> 01:40:40,881
We must tell our people.

897
01:40:45,356 --> 01:40:47,273
We must tell our people

898
01:40:50,293 --> 01:40:52,020
so their souls may rest in peace.

899
01:40:57,827 --> 01:41:00,410
(wind howling)

900
01:41:03,122 --> 01:41:05,872
(ethereal music)

901
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:16,540
- What are you doing?

902
01:41:19,827 --> 01:41:23,110
- My skin will be less
noticeable than my close.

903
01:41:31,388 --> 01:41:33,721
There, if I don't come back,

904
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:39,310
you lay here quietly and
you wait till they've gone.

905
01:41:40,338 --> 01:41:41,421
You go north.

906
01:41:43,209 --> 01:41:45,792
(solemn music)

907
01:42:19,307 --> 01:42:20,474
- Go with God.

908
01:42:48,229 --> 01:42:50,979
(dramatic music)

909
01:43:46,394 --> 01:43:49,061
(rifle booming)

910
01:44:01,075 --> 01:44:04,173
(water splashing)

911
01:44:04,173 --> 01:44:06,756
(wind howling)

912
01:44:08,682 --> 01:44:09,515
- Get.

913
01:44:49,469 --> 01:44:52,136
(rifle booming)

914
01:45:11,519 --> 01:45:16,519
(Juana crying)
(baby crying)

915
01:45:50,672 --> 01:45:53,339
(rifle booming)

916
01:46:22,128 --> 01:46:27,128
(Juana crying)
(baby crying)

917
01:46:57,783 --> 01:47:00,700
(children yelling)

918
01:47:10,538 --> 01:47:13,288
(dramatic music)

919
01:48:00,739 --> 01:48:02,273
(solemn music)

920
01:48:02,273 --> 01:48:05,863
- They were killed with this.

921
01:48:19,270 --> 01:48:20,103
- Damn you.

922
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:07,190
- I can see everything clearly now.

923
01:49:09,627 --> 01:49:11,294
I was under a spell.

924
01:49:13,870 --> 01:49:16,427
I could hear nothing but
the music of the pearl.

925
01:49:18,255 --> 01:49:20,422
I didn't know it was evil.

926
01:49:23,750 --> 01:49:24,650
- What are they doing?

927
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:28,430
- They are returning the pearl to the sea.

928
01:49:30,079 --> 01:49:30,912
- What?

929
01:49:32,115 --> 01:49:34,865
(dramatic music)

930
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:38,213
- Shoot him.

931
01:49:48,833 --> 01:49:51,390
- Give me that gun, you bastard.

932
01:49:57,872 --> 01:49:58,705
- Juana.

933
01:50:12,703 --> 01:50:13,536
- No, no.

934
01:50:15,508 --> 01:50:18,175
(hopeful music)

935
01:50:49,995 --> 01:50:52,245
(laughing)

936
01:51:00,083 --> 01:51:02,583
(rifle booms)

937
01:51:48,208 --> 01:51:50,958
(waves crashing)

938
01:51:57,774 --> 01:52:00,524
(fire crackling)

939
01:52:01,358 --> 01:52:04,275
(orchestral music)
