1
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,643
Could you turn on
the light for me?

2
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,678
No problem, mister.

3
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,703
Missus not here.

4
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:23,437
Me clean.
No understand.

5
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,407
No understand.
Missus not here.

6
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,073
Just look at this.

7
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,652
Someone tore 6 pages
out of this magazine.

8
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,722
Can you imagine?

9
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,051
- Talk to the manager.
- Where is he?

10
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,922
- Try the meat section.
- The nerve of some people.

11
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:29,039
All done?
Thank you.

12
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,407
Man...
Telephone.

13
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,446
- Who?
- Me not know name.

14
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,881
Was it Frank, Herbert,
Mr. Ostermayer maybe?

15
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,044
It doesn't matter.
See you next Friday.

16
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,121
- Thanks.
- Good-bye.

17
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,338
Huber's sick again.

18
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,315
Can you turn it down a little?

19
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,052
- Can you get it?
- OK.

20
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,423
Hofstatter.

21
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:32,334
Mom, can I stay over
at a girlfriend's tomorrow?

22
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,372
Which girlfriend?

23
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,307
Anna.
You don't know her.

24
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,174
All right,
but ask your dad too.

25
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,979
Slavicza has wreaked havoc
in my CDs again.

26
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,489
I can't find any
of my Schubert.

27
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,459
Dad, can I stay over
at a girlfriend's tomorrow?

28
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,931
- Who is she?
- Anna. She's in the same grade as me.

29
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,334
- What do you have planned?
- Listen to music, study math.

30
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,473
- Where do they live?
- They've got a house.

31
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,043
- What do you think?
- It's fine with me.

32
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,167
Okay.

33
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,405
We ought to look
for a new place.

34
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,483
This development's
going to pot.

35
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,322
Bon appetit.

36
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,829
What do your friend's parents do?

37
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:42,169
Her mother has a shop.
I don't know about her father.

38
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,636
I'm off. Bye.

39
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,942
- Sleep tight.
- Have a good shift.

40
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,975
She's not here,
she's on duty.

41
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,978
Rudolph Hospital.

42
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,070
Good-bye.

43
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,150
- Who was that?
- It was for Mom.

44
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,481
Room 408, Mrs. Machant.

45
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,560
Machant - unchanged.

46
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,933
Kovac too - unchanged.

47
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,400
- Guess who called me yesterday.
- Who?

48
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,495
- Schneider.
- Schneider who?

49
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,039
Dr. Schneider.

50
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,372
What did he want?

51
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,972
Blah, blah, how I'm doing,
what's new, is everything okay?

52
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:59,278
Whether I still go swimming
once a week? Shit like that.

53
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:02,286
I told him I don't really have
time for this...

54
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:05,551
- Mrs. Reichold?
- Vomited twice.

55
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,960
She's not doing
too good at all.

56
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,495
Then suddenly he goes:

57
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:15,226
Mrs. Keinrath, I'll get back to you
in a couple of hours. Bye.

58
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:18,064
His wife probably
walked in right then.

59
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,731
Mrs. Zipfer...
Being discharged tomorrow.

60
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:25,703
- Granddaughter's picking her up...
- Really? Nice girl. I like her.

61
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,406
So then a few hours later
he really calls...

62
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,542
A man's last suit
has no pockets.

63
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:37,019
We've lost sight of that,
thus our current global state.

64
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:40,092
Let's go to sleep,
shall we?

65
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,127
A man's last suit
has no pockets.

66
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,398
No.

67
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,568
I don't feel like sleeping.

68
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,138
I'd rather think.

69
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,174
If I don't, no one will.

70
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,078
What do you think about?

71
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,581
You don't know beforehand.

72
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,309
You can't will yourself
to think,

73
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,444
you gotta let it happen.

74
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,824
Then ideas
just come to you.

75
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,728
You try that
when you've got some time.

76
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,845
I'll make us
some more coffee.

77
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,254
Has he fallen asleep?

78
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,223
No, not really,
he's just dozing.

79
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,796
It's quiet tonight.

80
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,173
- Morning.
- Morning.

81
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,544
- Morning.
- Morning.

82
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,080
- How was it?
- Quiet.

83
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,875
- Morning.
- Morning.

84
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,156
- What are you doing in Vienna?
- I wanted to see you again.

85
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,281
How did you know
I work here?

86
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,360
I called your number.

87
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,396
Was that your daughter?

88
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,139
I didn't think
we'd see each other again.

89
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,682
How long
are you staying?

90
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,188
I might be able
to come back tonight.

91
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,119
I'll wait here.

92
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:07,072
- What kept you?
- Things were chaotic last night. Bye.

93
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,084
Hello. You're late.

94
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,917
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

95
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,957
It was really chaotic.

96
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,357
The obscene elevator scribbler
struck again...

97
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,395
Yes, I noticed.

98
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,006
I'm on duty again tonight.

99
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,009
But we've got concert tickets.

100
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,045
I know, but Uschi is sick
and Monika's on vacation.

101
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:43,080
I'm sorry.

102
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,116
Why don't you call
your sister?

103
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,151
She always says
she's so lonely.

104
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,201
She locked herself out again.
What a scatterbrain.

105
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,277
I'm going for a jog.

106
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,105
Can you turn it down?
Your mom's sleeping.

107
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:47,071
Good morning.
Did you sleep well?

108
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,107
Listen to this:

109
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,544
Apartment
in a brand-new building,

110
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,613
centrally located,
120 sq m,

111
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:57,648
open design,
big terrace,

112
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,617
quiet courtyard.
What do you think?

113
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,244
- Sounds good.
- Shall I call them?

114
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,455
Could we look at it?

115
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,330
Hofstatter. Yes, thank you.
Good-bye.

116
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,009
Tomorrow at 1 p.m.

117
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,814
The obscene scribbler
struck again...

118
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,008
- You told me already.
- When?

119
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,176
- This morning.
- Did I?

120
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,425
He plays
with such intense passion.

121
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,073
- Are you almost done?
- Just a second.

122
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:19,096
- Enjoy the concert.
- Thanks.

123
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,632
- And say hi to Edith.
- I will. Bye.

124
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,866
Good evening.
Can you connect me with Mr. Tomasz...?

125
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,437
I've forgotten his last name.

126
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,141
It was the seventh floor, room...

127
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,212
Forget it.

128
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,588
Wanna grab a bite?

129
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,157
- Let's go straight to your place.
- OK.

130
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,906
A glass of wine?

131
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,948
- You had it developed already?
- Yes.

132
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,793
Do you like it?

133
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,457
Wait, wait.

134
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,765
May I blindfold you?

135
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,353
How long can you stay?

136
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:39,356
Till tomorrow morning.

137
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,493
Then let's go out
to dinner.

138
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,050
What's wrong?

139
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,551
- Do you know her?
- I don't think so.

140
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,595
- Do you know her?
- Nope.

141
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,663
Yes you do,
you know her.

142
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:23,030
- I do not, how should I?
- You're lying.

143
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,737
You're back at her house?

144
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,468
And your friend's parents
let her stay out that late?

145
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:42,783
I'm back at the hospital.
The man you saw me with

146
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:47,621
was a colleague.
We went for a walk.

147
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:49,660
See you tomorrow.

148
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:06,475
- Go down on me.
- Is that what you want?

149
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:38,200
The room service waiter
watched you eating me out.

150
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,641
He was young, dark hair.

151
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,208
I wanted him to watch us.

152
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,117
I saw him come in.

153
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,457
Give me the camera.

154
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,481
I love you.

155
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,418
I love you.

156
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,088
I love you.

157
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,807
I've never fucked like
this before.

158
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,283
Do whatever
you want with me.

159
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,184
Spread your legs.

160
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,242
Now stroke yourself.

161
00:26:20,645 --> 00:26:22,579
No, I can't.

162
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,299
Are you married too?

163
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,161
Children?

164
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,264
How old?

165
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:25,638
Five and seven.

166
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,062
How long
are you staying?

167
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,632
My plane leaves
tomorrow morning.

168
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,504
I can't come tonight.

169
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,965
Please don't stop.

170
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,647
Here's my number
at the hospital.

171
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,309
Call me there instead,
if you want.

172
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,488
I'll miss you.

173
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,359
I better be going.
Take care.

174
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:01,486
- How was it?
- Quiet.

175
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,584
- And your concert?
- Good.

176
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,196
- We're looking at that place today.
- When?

177
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,562
- At one.
- I better get some sleep then.

178
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:12,067
- What about breakfast?
- I ate at work.

179
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,831
Sweet dreams.

180
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,355
How was it?

181
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:34,390
- What?
- With your girlfriend?

182
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:39,820
Uhm... okay.

183
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:42,194
We're looking at an apartment.
Want to come?

184
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,699
No, I have to study.

185
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:45,792
We have to leave
in fifteen minutes.

186
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,371
I'll be ready in a sec.

187
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,891
- I don't understand this.
- Maybe he forgot.

188
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,554
- Let's go home.
- Let me call him.

189
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:24,206
This is Hofstatter.
We had an appointment at one.

190
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:28,172
Why aren't you here?
We're waiting for you.

191
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:32,306
We've been waiting for 20 minutes.
Why didn't you cancel?

192
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,008
What did you say?

193
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,848
What about my time?

194
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:42,620
He's not coming,
he already rented the place.

195
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:46,493
He has no qualms about wasting our time.
I won't stand for this.

196
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,966
I'm calling his agency.
The nerve of that guy.

197
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,104
- Answering machine.
- It's Sunday.

198
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,402
I'm not letting them
treat me this way.

199
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,443
Can we just go home?

200
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,479
The nerve of him.
He's not normal.

201
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,344
- You don't care.
- What makes you think that?

202
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,612
I'm no sucker.
And you don't even care.

203
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:12,450
That's not true,
but it's no use, it's Sunday.

204
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:15,390
I make an effort
and no one cares.

205
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,519
- What do you mean?
- I make an appointment, no one shows.

206
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,756
I get concert tickets,
you have to work.

207
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,593
What?

208
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,158
We discussed this.
A colleague got sick, it's not my fault.

209
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:29,273
- I told you two months ago...
- You are so egotistical.

210
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:32,103
- That's your opinion.
- Can we please just go?

211
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,455
Can I go
to my friend's again?

212
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,495
- What about your homework?
- I'm done.

213
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,531
- What do you say?
- Fine with me.

214
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,566
All right,
but be back by eight.

215
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,831
I left something in the car.
Where are the keys?

216
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:03,372
- Over there.
- Thanks.

217
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,408
I'll be right back.

218
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,450
Hello, it's me, Eva.

219
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,449
You're there at the hotel...
in our room.

220
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,490
What are you doing?

221
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,493
Looking at your pictures.

222
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,528
What do you plan
to do with them?

223
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,564
Take them with me.

224
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,600
They turned out nice.

225
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,738
Come here.

226
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,077
Are you still there?

227
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,648
Come here.

228
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,953
If only I could...

229
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,956
But I can't.

230
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,338
21 channels
and nothing but crap.

231
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,407
What a joke.

232
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,718
These German film titles.

233
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,721
"The Dummy Crisis".

234
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:45,008
You scared me.

235
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:47,976
- You're so nervous today.
- You just startled me.

236
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:51,139
What if we go
to the movies tonight?

237
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,216
- The movies?
- Why not?

238
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,717
We haven't done that
in a long time. I've circled 3.

239
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,256
- This one got good reviews...
- All right.

240
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,381
- Are you OK?
- Why shouldn't I be?

241
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:04,120
- There's something wrong...
- No, I'm fine.

242
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,321
- What time does it start?
- 7:30.

243
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,591
Don't move,
I'll get a broom.

244
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,634
I'll call Iris to tell her
we're going out.

245
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,948
- What was that?
- Over there I think.

246
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,769
Did she scream for help?
Huh?

247
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,572
Probably just
a marital quarrel.

248
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,575
Probably.

249
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:58,280
Back to the real estate section.
High time we got out of this place.

250
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,307
- That weirdo again.
- Did he say anything?

251
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,345
They never say anything.

252
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:33,249
I'll have it traced next time.

253
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,625
Let's go to bed?

254
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,424
- Do you want to go first?
- No, go ahead.

255
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:00,831
Could you turn on
the light for me?

256
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:02,428
No problem, mister.

257
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,448
You shouldn't be smoking
when you're pregnant.

258
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,788
- I'm not pregnant.
- Not pregnant?

259
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,318
I just said that
because of Marco.

260
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,623
He wants a baby so bad.
We'd get married.

261
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:33,663
And he really thinks you're...

262
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,396
We even bought wallpaper
for the nursery.

263
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:39,492
How long
has this been going on?

264
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:42,538
- Two months.
- I don't believe it.

265
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,541
Men are so stupid.

266
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,544
What's so funny?

267
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,479
I figured I'd tell him
and get pregnant right after.

268
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,747
I ovulate this weekend.

269
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,584
It could work,
people have premature babies.

270
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,624
Two months...

271
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,657
All I can say is "good luck".

272
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,571
Just look at this.

273
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,674
Someone tore 6 pages
out of this magazine.

274
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,072
Can you imagine?

275
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:22,611
- Talk to the manager.
- Where is he?

276
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:25,307
- Try the meat section.
- The nerve of some people.

277
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,383
- Bottle receipt?
- No.

278
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,494
19.20, please.

279
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,505
Thank you.

280
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,515
Hey baby.

281
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:04,546
I'm on ladder now,
I call you right back.

282
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,521
I'm on ladder,
I call back. Okay, ciao.

283
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,546
What a fox.

284
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,316
You think she screams
when you screw her?

285
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,391
Or does she just lie there?

286
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,427
I dunno,
I first have to try her.

287
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,229
Shit. I forgot.

288
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,698
Moment.

289
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:10,342
Marco, what's wrong with you?
You said you'd call right back.

290
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:13,183
You made me wait
like a fool for an hour.

291
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,225
If I say I'll call right back,
I call right back.

292
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,395
You don't love me.

293
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:23,266
Where are you anyway?

294
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,492
Who with?

295
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:31,574
- And who else?
- Nobody. Robert and me.

296
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:33,643
And billboard.

297
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:38,713
You know.
I come soon.

298
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,582
Ciao.

299
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,880
- She is jealous woman.
- She's got good reason to be.

300
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:50,550
What reason?
No reason.

301
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:54,391
- I love her with my life.
- You people amaze me, man.

302
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:56,693
Hey, you marry with Astrid,

303
00:43:57,768 --> 00:44:00,737
you know whole life
you fuck one woman.

304
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:03,999
Then come this woman,
she want fuck you,

305
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,234
you fuck her, no?

306
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,312
Yeah, I guess you're right.

307
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:11,846
Simple, no?
You have only to use logic.

308
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,863
Where is he?

309
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,397
- Hey man, that your car?
- Yeah, so what?

310
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,731
- No standing, man.
- I ain't allowed to be here?

311
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,998
- You block my parking.
- I ain't allowed?

312
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:10,504
Move the car.

313
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:13,633
Don't shit your pants, Yugo,
you got plenty of room.

314
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:16,803
- Move the shit.
- What did you say?

315
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:19,677
- Move the shitcar.
- What did you say about my car?

316
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:25,554
- Move the shit.
- Why so nervous, boy? Got a problem?

317
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:29,591
- You asking for problem?
- A Yugo twerp ain't no problem for me.

318
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,543
Hello honey.

319
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,975
Honey,
sorry I was so angry on the phone.

320
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,047
No problem.

321
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,445
- You're not angry with me?
- Naw, forget it.

322
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,243
- I have question too.
- What?

323
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,821
- You wanna go dance tonight?
- I'd love to.

324
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,357
You like go Yugo disco?

325
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:14,162
Tonight I can't come.

326
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:20,105
- Tell me tomorrow. I call you.
- Honey, you hungry?

327
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,144
We go out, eat there.

328
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:25,181
Gotta go.

329
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,184
I call you. Ciao.

330
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,869
- You like her?
- Astrid?

331
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,340
She good woman.
Strong woman.

332
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:59,307
When we fuck, she's really loud.
I love that.

333
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:01,041
I'm wild about her.

334
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:04,211
When she comes,
she makes the strangest sound.

335
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:07,448
- Never heard anything like it.
- What sound she make?

336
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:10,526
It's hard to describe.
Like yodeling.

337
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:13,926
- Yodeling?
- Not yodeling, but kinda like it.

338
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:18,496
- I can't describe it.
- Wow baby, I need a drink.

339
00:47:18,602 --> 00:47:21,833
- You must to order "Bamboo."
- I'll get one for you.

340
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:28,409
- You like this place?
- It's totally wicked.

341
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,503
Not same like yodeling?

342
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,836
Baby, there you are,
I look everyplace.

343
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:03,947
We go have drink.

344
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:12,148
- What are we drinking to?
- Toast to my son.

345
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,352
Sonja is so good woman,
when doctor say she got pregnant,

346
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,488
no more cigarettes,
no alcohol...

347
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,567
- Nothing.
- That's great.

348
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:27,603
Isn't it boring not being able
to drink or smoke?

349
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:30,172
Not if you know

350
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:35,868
Is cool song.
C'mon, let's dance.

351
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:42,708
- You sure got a sweet boyfriend.
- I know.

352
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,598
Saw you shakin' your fanny
with the Yugos.

353
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:39,732
Yeah, I dance if I have to.

354
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:42,140
Look, we put up
these billboards too.

355
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,475
Right Marco?
That's our work.

356
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:46,515
All billboards

357
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:50,648

359
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:56,290
Good idea.
You drive, I roll.

00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:59,329
Go easy,

361
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:08,803
- Here, Sonja.
- Hey, she is pregnant woman.

362
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:12,636
Sorry.
I forgot.

363
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,734
But you're so skinny.

364
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,680
People always think I'm pregnant,
but I'm not.

365
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:22,217
I think you're perfect.

366
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,549
Love handles.

367
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:27,851
Not like the floozies
on those billboards of yours?

368
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:31,223
- They're not bad either, huh?
- Yeah right...

369
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:36,525
Hey Astrid, my favorite song.
I teach you lyric.

370
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:39,863
"Long time ago..."
Uh, forget it.

371
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:43,531
He sing about man
who leave wife and become rich man.

372
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:46,437
He lose all his money,
and then he go back.

373
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:50,708
Why he go back?
Nobody know. Just he know why.

374
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:53,305
And now...

375
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,886
he say he make
big mistakes.

376
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,955
Now he come back
to see wife before he die.

377
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:19,336
- "...before I die." You like?
- Great lyrics.

378
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:21,968
- Pretty, but sad.
- Is same like real life.

379
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,046
What's so sad about it?

380
00:51:24,147 --> 00:51:27,048
First he leaves her
and then he's all remorseful.

381
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,084
It's just a song.

382
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:32,246
You're not leaving me,
though, are you?

383
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:35,449
- Not anytime soon.
- Listen, listen. Song continues.

384
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,349
Baby,
what's the problem?

385
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,418
Baby, tell me.

386
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:05,612
You couldn't take your eyes off her
all evening.

387
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:09,589
You and your Astrid.
Baby, baby.

388
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:12,355
Do I do that to you?
You think I'm stupid?

389
00:52:12,496 --> 00:52:15,488
You think I'm blind
and don't see it?

390
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,567
- I don't do that to you.
- You and your silly head...

391
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:23,672
You don't love me.

392
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,675
But baby,
I love only you.

393
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:30,610
You don't call when you say you will.
I always call if I say so.

394
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,148
Baby, I told you already
I was on ladder.

395
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,310
Astrid is Robert's girlfriend.

396
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:41,154
- My woman is you, only you.
- Really?

397
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,192
You are mother
of my child.

398
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:54,794
Let's go upstairs.

399
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,791
What you doing?

400
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,895

00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:28,267
- I hear baby.
- Marco, that's impossible.

402
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:31,602
It's this big.
Like a worm.

403
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,815
Yes, yes I hear,
small sound.

404
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:44,920

There, you want talk? Talk.

Fine, thanks. Visiting her grandpa

Yeah sure...
Bye.

440
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,661
Honey...

441
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,933
Honey, sorry.

442
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:27,525
Honey,
please say something.

443
00:58:28,638 --> 00:58:30,572
I thought you didn't
love me anymore.

444
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,607
That's not true.

445
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:35,507
- But sometimes is difficult, Sonja.
- Then you're not angry?

446
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:38,513
C'mon, don't cry.

447
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:40,583
Come here.

448
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:50,518
Robert must think
I'm completely crazy.

449
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:59,266
We go for walk.

450
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:03,668
- I go for walk with Fipsi.
- Okay.

451
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:06,207
Fipsi, going for
another walk so late?

452
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:09,210
First walk only last 10 minute,
poor Fipsi.

453
00:59:09,312 --> 00:59:12,713
- Okay, see you.
- See you.

454
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:32,327
I don't know
any Marco.

455
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:35,823
My name's Mario.
Bye.

456
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:55,474
- Okay, ciao.
- Ciao Marco.

457
01:00:59,455 --> 01:01:01,389
Ciao Fipsi.

458
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,686
Come by tomorrow.
Mario won't be here...

459
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:06,159
- and we can be wilder.
- I dunno...

460
01:01:06,262 --> 01:01:08,196
I call you, yes?

461
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:18,632
I want to go for walk,
but turn into marathon.

462
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:33,421
Hello honey.

463
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:54,836
I'm tired.

464
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:57,411
We do it tomorrow, okay?

465
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:53,201
Hi. It's Sonja.
Is Marco there?

466
01:02:55,505 --> 01:02:57,973
Nothing.
It's just he forgot his cell phone.

467
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,631
Bye.

468
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,811
Hello, awake already?

469
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,291
Mario?

470
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:20,020
Yes he's right here,
but who are you?

471
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:22,626
Hello?

472
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:50,425
Baby, brush.

473
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:09,177
Finished.

474
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:12,580
- Is good, yes?
- Nice.

475
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:16,516
- You don't like?
- I do, it's great. Fine.

476
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,323
- I do job like pro.
- Yeah, great.

477
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,684
- I feel like smoking cigarette.
- Go ahead, have one.

478
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:29,458
- It's okay?
- We can open the window afterwards.

479
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,533
- You allow me?
- Yes.

480
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:35,703
I do just one time.

481
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:42,275
Maybe we should have taken
the teddy bear wallpaper?

482
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:45,836
No, that's too dark.
Baby must to have light.

483
01:04:45,982 --> 01:04:47,916
Better this one.

484
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:53,421
Better I smoke on balcony.

485
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:17,538
Baby...
You sleeping?

486
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:22,376
- I go for walk with Fipsi.
- Okay.

487
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:37,078
Baby?

488
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:49,690
Shit.

489
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:19,619
Marco Jukic.
My girlfriend swallow pills.

490
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:24,250

01:09:24,393 --> 01:09:26,657

Mogadon and...
Halcion.

495
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,844
Moment.

496
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:44,879
Yes, breathing, breathing.

497
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:48,182
Come quick. Please.

498
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:21,216
Sonja, wake up.

499
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:28,222
Yes, yes.

500
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:33,461
Yes, breathing, yes.

501
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,361
In bed,

502
01:10:36,465 --> 01:10:38,399
on back, yes.

503
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,244
Hi Kurt. Hello.

504
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:54,639
Patient ingested a mixture
of Mogado, Halcion,

505
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:56,717
and alcohol.

506
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:59,117
We found her lying
unconscious on her bed.

507
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:18,395
- Please, not going to die, no?
- Don't worry. Wait outside.

508
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:21,338
- Here are pills she swallow.
- I know, thank you.

509
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:47,302
We have a room for you now, Doctor.
We'll wake you in time.

510
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:51,598
I'd like to leave this.
For Eva Hofstatter.

511
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:54,868
- I'll see her in the morning.
- Internal medicine ward.

512
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:57,069
- I know Eva.
- Thank you.

513
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:52,866
Don't take shit from nobody,
remember that.

514
01:13:00,743 --> 01:13:03,610
- Surprise.
- What's that for?

515
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:05,680
I shot it for you.

516
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:12,013
I bought a convertible.

517
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:14,714
A Le Baron.
Color: Petrol.

518
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:16,791
- Great.
- Want to see it?

519
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:18,859
No time.
I'm waiting for someone.

520
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:24,296
- It's down in the garage.
- You can't park there.

521
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,334
- What?
- You don't live here anymore.

522
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:28,528
What's so hard
about going downstairs

523
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,661
to check out
my new wheels?

524
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:40,078
You read about the
new car smuggling ring?

525
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:43,242
Turks and Polacks,
they'll rob you blind.

526
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:46,844
Better not mess with me.
Let me show it to you.

527
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:49,048
You know
I don't care about cars.

528
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:53,920
Okay. Maybe next time.
We can go for a little drive.

529
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:01,435
Please leave.

530
01:14:19,788 --> 01:14:22,313
Way to go, Mario.
There, blow up the asteroid.

531
01:14:25,494 --> 01:14:27,428
- Get lost, now.
- In a minute.

532
01:14:27,529 --> 01:14:29,463
I said now.

533
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:31,760
Sorry about the vase,
no hard feelings, huh.

534
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:33,834
I don't give a damn
about the vase.

535
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:35,870
Get out
of my apartment.

536
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:37,962
Why so nervous?
I won't hurt you.

537
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:40,040
Don't take no shit,
right Mario?

538
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,610
Get out of my apartment.

539
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:49,311
- Get your foot out.
- You don't get it, that's the problem.

540
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:51,476
- Get your foot out of my door.
- All right.

541
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:55,285
Look at you,
you're totally hysterical.

542
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:00,060
Totally hysterical.

543
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:18,471
You're a thug,
a common thug.

544
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:33,060
- Hey man, that your car?
- Yeah, so what?

545
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:34,719
No parking, man.

546
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:37,058
- I ain't allowed to be here?
- You block my parking.

547
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,667
- I ain't allowed?
- Move the car.

548
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:42,463
Don't shit your pants, Yugo,
you got plenty of room.

549
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:45,437
- Move the shit.
- What did you say?

550
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,510
- Move the shitcar.
- What did you say about my car?

551
01:15:49,611 --> 01:15:51,545
- Move the shit.
- Why so nervous, boy?

552
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:54,138
- Got a problem?
- You asking for problem?

553
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:56,808
A Yugo twerp
ain't no problem for me.

554
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:02,089
Rabitsch speaking, hello.

555
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:06,261
Just a second.

556
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:08,829
Don't you dare
scratch my car.

557
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:10,865
So, what do we have for you?

558
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:13,160
Let's see, there's...

559
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:16,294
tomorrow.
How about ten o'clock?

560
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:21,970
Then maybe...
two o'clock. Okay?

561
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:27,505
House number 53,
I'll be waiting inside the apartment.

562
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:30,584
Thank you.
Good-bye.

563
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:55,806
Come here.
Don't be scared.

564
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:01,208
- Wow, you got nice car.
- Thanks.

565
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:04,751
- How about the two of us?
- How much?

566
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:08,455
Blow job... 50,

567
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:10,821
you want more,
you pay a little extra.

568
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:15,427
I got an alarm system too,
to keep Polacks off my car.

569
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:20,894
- So, what about us?
- Too expensive.

570
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:24,369
- What you want anyway?
- I wanna fuck.

571
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,532
- Normal fuck?
- Yeah, normal.

572
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:28,870
- How much you pay for fucking?
- Nothing.

573
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:32,572
Nothing.
Because I don't need this.

574
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:35,945
I can have any woman I want, for free.
Now get lost.

575
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:39,520
Stinkin' slut.

576
01:17:46,628 --> 01:17:49,358
Stinkin' sluts,
every last one of 'em.

577
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:07,911
Great, the agency gave me
my own apartment.

578
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:15,680
Mom, you gotta see a doctor,
I can't help you there.

579
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:21,588
Next week looks bad, I'm so busy.
I'll call you. Bye.

580
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:24,058
Hello, Rabitsch.

581
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,093
Mr. Gruber,
we spoke on the phone today.

582
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:28,355
Come in.
Feel at home.

583
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:30,988
Come in.
Feel at home.

584
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:33,693
- When is it due?
- In two weeks.

585
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:36,133
I have a son, this tall.

586
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:38,536
With a little tasteful decoration...

587
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,872
We'd have to tear out the tiles.

588
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:44,104
Once you move in,

589
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:46,373
you'll give the place
your own personal touch.

590
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:49,382
Bathtub for two.
Do you like it?

591
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:51,418
I bet you like that.

592
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,454
This is for the washing machine,
the sink...

593
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:56,251
This would be
the entrance hall.

594
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:59,827
- How cute. What's its name?
- Sammy.

595
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:01,895
Living room...

596
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:05,392
A bit dark, isn't it?

597
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:07,866
Yes well,
it's kind of a hazy day today.

598
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:11,565
No foreigners in this house,
family friendly,

599
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:13,640
dog friendly,
animal friendly.

600
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,644
As a matter of fact,
the vibrations here are better.

601
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:24,378
What's that odd-looking thing?

602
01:20:27,222 --> 01:20:29,452
Well,
that's a cute little idea.

603
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:32,959
A round window,
to let in extra light...

604
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:35,529
because this would
probably be the TV area.

605
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:38,792
What about the nursery?
Lt'll be cramped.

606
01:20:38,934 --> 01:20:41,869
The nursery...
It is kinda small, huh?

607
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:44,528
It's a two-room apartment.
That's what the ad said.

608
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,607
We thought
it would be bigger.

609
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,735
And here's the extra bonus:

610
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:52,904
An 80 sq m terrace
in heart of the city.

611
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:55,778
You can't even
just walk out onto it...

612
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:58,579
And this wall
protects your privacy.

613
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,745
You can grow
ivy on it,

614
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:02,914
or Virginia creeper
or whatever...

615
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:04,992
- Do you like it?
- No.

616
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:08,620
Because we hope
one day he'll have a big family...

617
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:10,890
with lots of kids
running around all day.

618
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:13,023
- Does it face south?
- Southeast.

619
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:17,001
That office building
is awfully close...

620
01:21:25,947 --> 01:21:27,881
Sit.

621
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:30,884
Down.

622
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:35,222
Sit, sit, sit.

623
01:21:36,825 --> 01:21:38,759
Down.

624
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,794
Nice dog.
Can I give him a nibble?

625
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:48,366
- Is that a Le Baron?
- 3.0 L V6.

626
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:50,461
- Horsepower?
- 140.

627
01:21:51,806 --> 01:21:53,740
Come. Heel.

628
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,187
- New vase.
- I don't want to see you anymore.

629
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:16,263
And something
for the vase.

630
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:18,298
Sorry about yesterday.

631
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:30,277
Thank you.

632
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:34,411
Mario wet his bed again.

633
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:37,417
He didn't get that
from me.

634
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:39,714
- Where is he, in his room?
- Can't you hear him?

635
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:45,826
Could you stop
coming here?

636
01:22:45,927 --> 01:22:48,361
Nicole,
I want to talk to you.

637
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,397
Like normal people.

638
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:52,898
But you won't listen to me,
that's the problem.

639
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:54,935
Okay, then talk.

640
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:03,411
I sold an apartment
yesterday.

641
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:05,706
The third one
this week.

642
01:23:05,847 --> 01:23:09,613
Do you know what that is?
It's an agency record.

643
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:12,949
- That's what you wanted to say?
- I just want to talk to you.

644
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:15,022
I don't want you around.

645
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:17,057
I'm tired of being beaten
every other day,

646
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:19,592
of getting in trouble for
forgetting your beer,

647
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:22,754
- of getting raped...
- Don't start this shit again.

648
01:23:22,897 --> 01:23:25,365
I was mad 'cause
you didn't wanna fuck.

649
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,832
I'm tired of fucking
whenever you feel like it.

650
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:30,928
You don't understand
what goes on up here.

651
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:33,438
Then tell me
and then leave.

652
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:37,678
Listen Nicole.

653
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:42,549
These are
hard times for you,

654
01:23:44,085 --> 01:23:46,553
I know,
what with the separation and all...

655
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:49,690
But you have to come to grips
with yourself.

656
01:23:49,824 --> 01:23:51,758
You're just distraught.

657
01:23:54,062 --> 01:23:56,030
Come to grips
with myself?

658
01:23:56,164 --> 01:23:59,600
- Yes.
- I'm distraught?

659
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:01,668
Yes.

660
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:11,545
How are you?

661
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:13,580
What are you doing?

662
01:24:17,419 --> 01:24:19,478
Yes, I'm waiting for you.

663
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:21,919
Can't wait to see you.

664
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:25,726
No, he's here.

665
01:24:31,366 --> 01:24:33,561
- Look at this.
- I think he hurt himself.

666
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:35,635
Can I call you back?

667
01:24:37,338 --> 01:24:39,306
- What have you done?
- Look at this.

668
01:24:41,543 --> 01:24:44,478
Wait. Sit down.
Hold still.

669
01:24:46,614 --> 01:24:48,548
- What's that?
- Iodine.

670
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:51,785
- Does it burn?
- Naw.

671
01:24:51,886 --> 01:24:54,514
Your present, I almost forgot.
Want me to get it?

672
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,590
I don't want
any presents.

673
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:01,728
Daddy hurt himself.
Doesn't matter.

674
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:03,764
Minor cut,
nothing serious.

675
01:25:04,833 --> 01:25:07,131
Come down with me
and see my convertible.

676
01:25:07,235 --> 01:25:09,396
I don't care
about your convertible.

677
01:25:11,172 --> 01:25:13,606
Then I'll bring it up.
I don't mind.

678
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:16,266
Is that okay?
Does it hurt?

679
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:22,073
Here.

680
01:25:22,217 --> 01:25:24,378
- Give it to your new girlfriend.
- Come on.

681
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:27,454
You like the color?

682
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:31,047
It was either silver or petrol,
but I figure petrol is cooler.

683
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:36,329
- Let's go for a drive.
- Alex, I don't want to.

684
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:38,398
That's okay.

685
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:42,469
You'll come around.

686
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:48,875
Look.

687
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:56,817
Alarm system.
Sure you don't want to?

688
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:58,885
Next time.

689
01:26:18,139 --> 01:26:20,073
Bye.

690
01:26:33,588 --> 01:26:36,523
Come over here.
Come on.

691
01:26:38,459 --> 01:26:40,484
- How are you?
- Fine.

692
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:42,721
Thought about it?
You and me, baby?

693
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:45,560
Blow job... 50.
Fucking... 200.

694
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:49,192
Hey, do I look like someone
who has to pay for a fuck?

695
01:26:50,305 --> 01:26:52,535
Do I look like someone
who has to pay for a fuck?

696
01:26:52,674 --> 01:26:54,608
Look at me.

697
01:26:55,677 --> 01:26:58,111
Do you really think
I need that?

698
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:01,748
Go ahead
and think it over.

699
01:27:27,642 --> 01:27:29,872
Come quick,
there's idiot here.

700
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:54,834
What are you doing here?

701
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:57,166
Just standing.
Ain't nothing against that?

702
01:27:57,305 --> 01:28:01,207
- This here is a no parking zone.
- Yeah? I hadn't noticed.

703
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:08,482
Hey, are you crazy?
You can't piss in my car.

704
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:11,210
What car?
It's as good as gone.

705
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:13,877
You heard the man:
No parking zone.

706
01:28:38,546 --> 01:28:40,480
Lousy,
fuckin' bitches.

707
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:08,674
Shit.

708
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:19,086
I know.
I had another appointment.

709
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:21,552
I'll be there in ten minutes.
Bye.

710
01:29:32,433 --> 01:29:34,367
Assholes.

711
01:29:39,173 --> 01:29:41,971
There they are,
those jerks.

712
01:29:47,949 --> 01:29:49,507
Hello, Rabitsch.

713
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:51,584
Sorry,
I had another appointment.

714
01:29:51,686 --> 01:29:53,620
Come in.

715
01:29:55,723 --> 01:29:57,315
Sorry.

716
01:30:00,027 --> 01:30:02,962
- Well?
- We'll think about it.

717
01:30:03,097 --> 01:30:05,065
Think about it.

718
01:30:05,199 --> 01:30:07,133
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

719
01:30:08,636 --> 01:30:11,332
Sorry, we won't be taking it.
It's too expensive.

720
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:14,566
- Go fuck yourself.
- I beg your pardon?

721
01:30:15,676 --> 01:30:18,577
- Go fuck yourself.
- C'mon, let's get out of here.

722
01:30:44,405 --> 01:30:46,339
I don't understand this.

723
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:48,841
Maybe he forgot.

724
01:31:05,726 --> 01:31:07,660
The apartment's
already taken.

725
01:31:09,997 --> 01:31:12,431
What do you want from me?
It's taken.

726
01:31:15,036 --> 01:31:17,971
Don't you think
I've got better things to do?

727
01:31:18,072 --> 01:31:20,506
The apartment is gone.
Time is money, man.

728
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:23,770
Your time ain't worth
diddly squat to me.

729
01:31:47,134 --> 01:31:49,068
Somethin' wrong?

730
01:31:55,142 --> 01:31:57,133
- I said it's over...
- Gotta talk to you.

731
01:31:57,278 --> 01:31:59,212
I don't want to talk.
Get your foot out.

732
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:02,442
Alex, stop it.
I'll scream.

733
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:05,711
- In front of Mario?
- He's at my mother's.

734
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:07,980
Then we got
the place to ourselves.

735
01:32:10,591 --> 01:32:12,525
Help!

736
01:32:12,627 --> 01:32:14,788
Stop being ridiculous.
I just want to talk.

737
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:21,034
You left this in the car.

738
01:32:21,135 --> 01:32:23,763
I don't want it.
Give it to your new floozy.

739
01:32:23,905 --> 01:32:25,839
Very funny.
Now take it.

740
01:32:26,941 --> 01:32:28,875
Or I'll get angry.

741
01:32:33,681 --> 01:32:36,047
Look, Nicole.
Let's be reasonable.

742
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:43,823
I hit you again,
but that's not what I want.

743
01:32:43,925 --> 01:32:45,859
You just don't get it.

744
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:58,404
This is our
Chinese restaurant.

745
01:32:58,506 --> 01:33:00,599
I always used
to get the chicken.

746
01:33:06,614 --> 01:33:08,548
Swimming pool.

747
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:11,584
Look,

748
01:33:11,686 --> 01:33:13,847
remember that old jacket?

749
01:33:19,026 --> 01:33:21,221
Amazing.
Look,

750
01:33:21,362 --> 01:33:23,523
I still had
long sideburns here.

751
01:33:27,068 --> 01:33:29,059
And this is...

752
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:33,940
carnival '97.
I puked for three days after that.

753
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:41,241
I missed an appointment
this morning.

754
01:33:41,382 --> 01:33:43,316
Kept those jerks
waiting half an hour.

755
01:33:44,385 --> 01:33:46,319
Who are you calling?

756
01:33:50,691 --> 01:33:52,625
That's the police.

757
01:33:53,728 --> 01:33:55,889
Are you dense
or something?

758
01:33:56,030 --> 01:33:58,624
We don't need the police,
I'm not hurting you.

759
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:05,071
Where was this?

760
01:34:10,778 --> 01:34:12,712
Maybe in Schwechat?

761
01:34:14,548 --> 01:34:16,539
We sure make
a great-looking couple.

762
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:18,949
Cheers.

763
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:29,327
Nicole,
your problem is you don't talk.

764
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:31,660
I've got my flaws too.

765
01:34:31,799 --> 01:34:34,893
Look, I don't have a new girlfriend,
I just said that.

766
01:34:35,036 --> 01:34:38,028
Women are stupid anyway,
except for you.

767
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:42,405
- I've got someone new.
- I know, consider it forgotten.

768
01:34:42,543 --> 01:34:44,477
No problem,
I forgive you.

769
01:34:50,117 --> 01:34:52,483
I'm dying to see
how this looks on you.

770
01:34:53,554 --> 01:34:55,784
If I try it on,
will you leave?

771
01:34:55,923 --> 01:34:57,857
Yeah, put it on...
Please.

772
01:35:01,562 --> 01:35:04,292
Great.
Fits great.

773
01:35:04,432 --> 01:35:07,595
- I'm cold.
- Okay. Get dressed.

774
01:35:07,735 --> 01:35:09,168
Thanks.

775
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:19,304
Can you leave now?

776
01:35:19,447 --> 01:35:23,008
Not until you get it through your head
that I love you.

777
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:26,747
That just doesn't
seem to sink in.

778
01:35:29,557 --> 01:35:31,991
Good evening.
I'd like to order some food.

779
01:35:33,928 --> 01:35:36,522
Mitterhofgasse 2,

780
01:35:36,664 --> 01:35:38,598
section IX,

781
01:35:39,667 --> 01:35:41,601
apartment 27.

782
01:35:44,805 --> 01:35:46,796
Hold on.
I'll call back in a second.

783
01:35:46,941 --> 01:35:48,875
Help!

784
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:23,810
It's me again.
Yes.

785
01:36:23,944 --> 01:36:27,402
I'd like a pizza Capricciosa
and a Del Amore.

786
01:36:28,849 --> 01:36:30,976
Excellent.
Bye.

787
01:36:40,027 --> 01:36:42,086
Sorry, but you
leave me no choice?

788
01:36:47,668 --> 01:36:49,659
Do you want
to throw all this away?

789
01:36:51,272 --> 01:36:54,298
And this?
And this...

790
01:36:54,441 --> 01:36:56,932
What more do you
expect me to do?

791
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:04,017
I'm sorry.

792
01:37:07,621 --> 01:37:09,816
Everything's going wrong,
I don't know why.

793
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:14,427
It's 'cause you won't listen to me,
Nicole, I love you.

794
01:37:14,562 --> 01:37:17,053
You're the most kick-ass woman
in the world.

795
01:37:24,638 --> 01:37:26,868
Can't you just
leave me alone?

796
01:37:34,481 --> 01:37:36,415
That's beside the point.

797
01:37:36,517 --> 01:37:38,542
Okay, I made a mistake,

798
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:42,053
but I've changed.
You must have noticed.

799
01:37:42,156 --> 01:37:44,090
Why do you think
I'm doing all this?

800
01:37:44,191 --> 01:37:46,625
The roses, lingerie,
vase, the convertible.

801
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:49,490
What can I do
to make you understand?

802
01:37:50,598 --> 01:37:52,532
You always
blow things up.

803
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:54,759
I plan a nice evening
and you go and ruin it.

804
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:56,836
How do you expect us
to go on this way?

805
01:37:57,905 --> 01:37:59,839
I don't,
we're through.

806
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:02,773
You're the one
who doesn't get it.

807
01:38:12,987 --> 01:38:15,785
- Is that him?
- Don't you dare hurt him.

808
01:38:17,658 --> 01:38:19,649
I don't have to take this.

809
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:33,334
Sorry man, I come see...

810
01:38:33,474 --> 01:38:35,408
No problem, come in.
Nicole's here.

811
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:38,444
- How cute, what's its name?
- Fipsi.

812
01:38:38,545 --> 01:38:40,479
Hi there, Fipsi.

813
01:38:41,815 --> 01:38:43,749
- I don't stay long...
- No problem.

814
01:38:44,818 --> 01:38:46,752
Lock the rat
in the bedroom, Yugo.

815
01:38:52,993 --> 01:38:54,927
Close the door.

816
01:38:57,364 --> 01:38:58,592
Move.

817
01:39:00,868 --> 01:39:01,800
Hi.

818
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:06,872
Sit down.

819
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:21,347
That's him?
The Yugo with the ridiculous Renault?

820
01:39:21,488 --> 01:39:23,615
That's him.

821
01:39:23,757 --> 01:39:25,952
With knife
you big strong man.

822
01:39:26,093 --> 01:39:28,027
Bravo.

823
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:30,062
Bravo,
your man is real man.

824
01:39:32,299 --> 01:39:34,233
I'm strong
without the knife, boy.

825
01:39:36,804 --> 01:39:38,772
- Get up.
- Don't.

826
01:39:38,906 --> 01:39:39,930
Stop it.

827
01:39:40,074 --> 01:39:42,269
Get up.
Or ain't you got the balls?

828
01:39:46,513 --> 01:39:48,447
Got the message, boy?

829
01:39:48,549 --> 01:39:51,211
You're such an asshole,
such an asshole.

830
01:39:51,352 --> 01:39:53,513
Get out of my life,
out of my apartment.

831
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,588
I don't need
your roses.

832
01:39:55,723 --> 01:39:58,590
I hate you.
I hate you.

833
01:39:58,692 --> 01:40:01,183
But Nicole,
that's not true.

834
01:40:02,296 --> 01:40:03,923
- You're bleeding.
- It's okay.

835
01:40:04,064 --> 01:40:06,498
- Is it broken?
- No, I need napkin.

836
01:40:06,633 --> 01:40:08,567
Come to the bathroom.

837
01:40:08,702 --> 01:40:10,636
He's such an asshole.
I'm sorry.

838
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:12,205
You die.

839
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:15,474
I don't have to take this.

840
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:28,845
He's always been an asshole.
I'm so sorry.

841
01:40:33,093 --> 01:40:35,323
He'll always
be an asshole.

842
01:40:36,964 --> 01:40:38,898
At least
nothing's broken.

843
01:40:38,999 --> 01:40:40,933
- Does it burn?
- No.

844
01:40:43,504 --> 01:40:45,529
I don't fuckin'
have to take this.

845
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:36,815
What the fuck...
Fuckin' piece of shit.

846
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:42,094
Never again.

847
01:41:44,698 --> 01:41:46,632
Never again.

848
01:41:57,678 --> 01:41:59,236
Shut up.

849
01:42:04,384 --> 01:42:06,318
Piece of shit clunker.

850
01:42:08,188 --> 01:42:10,122
Assholes.

851
01:42:17,097 --> 01:42:19,031
I don't believe this.

852
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:21,499
Damn it.

853
01:42:43,357 --> 01:42:45,518
The gentleman
has already checked out.

854
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,494
Gone for good?

855
01:42:48,595 --> 01:42:50,859
He checked out
an hour ago.

856
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:53,364
He must have taken
the earlier flight.

857
01:42:53,467 --> 01:42:55,833
May I go up to his room,
I forgot something.

858
01:42:55,936 --> 01:42:58,097
I'll send up a maid.

859
01:42:58,238 --> 01:43:01,002
Can I take care of it myself?
It's personal.

860
01:43:01,141 --> 01:43:03,075
I'm afraid
I can't do that...

861
01:43:03,177 --> 01:43:05,111
Please,
it's very important.

862
01:43:07,014 --> 01:43:08,038
Please.

863
01:43:40,847 --> 01:43:42,781
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

864
01:43:42,883 --> 01:43:45,579
- Is it broken?
- My arm, yes.

865
01:43:45,719 --> 01:43:48,187
That lunatic
ran a red light back there,

866
01:43:48,322 --> 01:43:50,313
am I glad nothing
worse happened...

867
01:43:50,457 --> 01:43:52,652
There should be some pictures
in the car.

868
01:43:52,793 --> 01:43:54,727
- Pictures?
- I dropped them.

869
01:43:54,828 --> 01:43:57,456
- I'll have a look.
- Thanks.

870
01:44:23,523 --> 01:44:25,013
It's me.

871
01:44:27,861 --> 01:44:30,352
Please stop shouting at me.
I'm in a hotel.

872
01:44:31,431 --> 01:44:34,457
No, I'm not alone.
I'll be staying here tonight.

873
01:44:36,203 --> 01:44:39,604
No, I don't want a divorce.
I just have a lover.

874
01:44:41,908 --> 01:44:44,376
Let's talk about it tomorrow.
Good night.

875
01:45:00,894 --> 01:45:02,828
It's me again.
Wait.

876
01:45:02,929 --> 01:45:05,363
I forgot to mention
I have the car.

877
01:45:05,465 --> 01:45:08,195
You'll have to take
the subway tomorrow. Bye.

878
01:45:11,605 --> 01:45:13,539
Everything's
the way it should be.

879
01:45:16,043 --> 01:45:18,034
We have
a good life together.

880
01:46:42,796 --> 01:46:44,730
Dead?

881
01:46:46,466 --> 01:46:48,400
Car accident?

882
01:46:53,473 --> 01:46:55,407
Thank you. Bye.

883
01:47:06,486 --> 01:47:08,420
Here you go.

884
01:47:13,026 --> 01:47:14,960
Want a sandwich?

885
01:47:30,510 --> 01:47:32,444
Hey baby.

886
01:47:37,851 --> 01:47:40,285
Nurse give me vase.

887
01:47:42,322 --> 01:47:44,256
I ran into door.

888
01:47:44,357 --> 01:47:46,154
Was so nervous.

889
01:47:47,727 --> 01:47:52,130
Dying isn't hard at all.
Strange.

890
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:57,602
Baby, why you did this?
Is no reason to.

891
01:48:02,742 --> 01:48:04,835
Because I lost the baby.

892
01:48:09,449 --> 01:48:11,383
But baby, no problem.

893
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:13,419
We make new baby.

894
01:48:16,223 --> 01:48:18,248
You say baby
so small like worm,

895
01:48:18,391 --> 01:48:20,325
so small.

896
01:48:22,896 --> 01:48:24,830
How's Fipsi?

897
01:48:44,618 --> 01:48:46,643
- Bye.
- Bye.

898
01:48:48,688 --> 01:48:50,952
Well, do they know
what I have yet?

899
01:48:51,091 --> 01:48:53,025
Still haven't found a thing.

900
01:48:53,126 --> 01:48:56,687
- You're a mystery, Mr. Riedel.
- Not to me, I know what I have.

901
01:48:56,830 --> 01:48:59,128
I think you're making
a fool of us all.

902
01:48:59,266 --> 01:49:01,734
People make fools
of themselves.

903
01:49:14,948 --> 01:49:16,882
I know you
from housing.

904
01:49:16,983 --> 01:49:19,417
