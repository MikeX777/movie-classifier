1
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:10,475
Syria has gained the upper hand
in the two-year-old Gulf Wars

2
00:01:10,555 --> 00:01:14,302
between itself, Iran, Iraq,
and Saudi Arabia.

3
00:01:14,396 --> 00:01:16,597
US Intelligence reports confirm

4
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:19,809
that a nuclear weapons center
outside Damascus, Syria...

5
00:01:19,889 --> 00:01:23,326
...is days away from becoming
completely operational.

6
00:01:23,406 --> 00:01:27,693
An experimental computer chip,
developed by the Syrian military,

7
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,710
has kept the United States
out of the war to this point.

8
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:35,545
The chip, when activated disables
any and all enemy communications

9
00:01:35,658 --> 00:01:39,890
including radar, cellular,
and computer-guided transmissions.

10
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,677
The existence of this chip
has made the impending nuclear threat

11
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,134
all the more serious
for the US Government.

12
00:01:46,214 --> 00:01:49,751
This is Robin Scott,
reporting for ZNN World News.

13
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,273
-We can’t launch our missiles.
-That is correct, Mr President.

14
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:01,045
As long as that signal
is being transmitted,

15
00:02:01,142 --> 00:02:05,733
our missiles, land or fighter-based
are unable to lock onto their targets,

16
00:02:05,856 --> 00:02:07,299
never mind arm themselves.

17
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,698
Now we can’t send the planes in,

18
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:12,335
we’ve already lost Lieutenant West
going to that route.

19
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:15,468
If he’s still alive,
he’s being held hostage.

20
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:19,645
Sir, our best guest has
Syrian nuclear site very close to

21
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:21,753
if not, 100 percent operational.

22
00:02:22,606 --> 00:02:25,756
At that current pace, they’re not going
to waste time in using it.

23
00:02:26,088 --> 00:02:29,054
President Sayda has assured me
that on no uncertain terms,

24
00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:31,482
they will not be using
nuclear capabilities.

25
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:33,537
It’s not President Sayda that worries me.

26
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:35,800
There’s a multitude of forces
we know nothing about

27
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,569
that could seize control at any moment.

28
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,627
Mr President, with all due respect,
we have to strike now.

29
00:02:58,685 --> 00:02:59,794
Admiral Torrance.

30
00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:02,543
Yes, sir.

31
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,860
Green Light Freedom Strike.

32
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:12,712
Okay, the objective is
to secure the transmission site

33
00:03:12,803 --> 00:03:14,233
and retrieve the chip.

34
00:03:14,313 --> 00:03:16,677
The Battle Group will be staging
an air-engagement with the enemy,

35
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:19,495
as a decoy to buy us time to crossover.

36
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:22,929
The billion dollar technology
is no bigger than this,

37
00:03:23,022 --> 00:03:25,241
and Washington wants it intact.

38
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:27,162
The chip is located
in the central mainframe.

39
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:30,842
I’ll need two minutes, maybe less,
to shut down the program.

40
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:33,705
I can’t just rip it out
because it’s already been activated.

41
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,244
The enemy command center’s located
underneath a Mausoleum

42
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,110
in the center of a war-torn village.

43
00:03:38,213 --> 00:03:42,180
Now, if we can position ourselves
across the way here at a high trajectory,

44
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,389
we’ll be able to pinpoint
the best mode of entry.

45
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:48,793
The drop of point is 300 yards off shore,
in the beautiful Mediterranean.

46
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,000
Now that should provide us
with an adequate cover.

47
00:03:51,113 --> 00:03:54,568
The underground entrance is secured
by a standard punch code lock.

48
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:57,264
We have enough fuel to last 20 minutes.

49
00:03:57,897 --> 00:04:00,262
So, in and out in 15. Questions?

50
00:04:08,996 --> 00:04:11,212
Yes, sir, fighters are being launched,
they are being deployed.

51
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,111
Yes, sir.

52
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:19,306
Birds launching, sir.

53
00:04:56,037 --> 00:04:58,330
063, this is Ring Leader, check in.

54
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,626
Team Leader, this 063,
Falcon is ready to play, sir.

55
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:04,021
Alright, proceeding to checkpoint Zebra.

56
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:04,808
Colonel, two US fighters approaching.

57
00:06:07,213 --> 00:06:09,097
-Redirect Squandron 17 immediately.
-Yes, sir.

58
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:46,051
<i>063, this is 064.</i>

59
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:48,230
<i>I’m not showing anything yet.
How about you?</i>

60
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,078
<i>Negative, 064.
I have a feeling it won’t be long though.</i>

61
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:52,596
<i>Alright, keep looking.</i>

62
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,276
<i>Here we go. Bandit, bandit.</i>

63
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:07,477
<i>12,000 feet bearing 05, and 40 miles.</i>

64
00:07:07,588 --> 00:07:09,336
<i>Nose is hot.
Maneuvering to intercept.</i>

65
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:14,736
<i>Roger, 064.</i>

66
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,774
<i>Freedom Strike, this is Command Center.
We have contact.</i>

67
00:07:17,865 --> 00:07:20,524
<i>Repeat, we have contact.
Prepare for take-off.</i>

68
00:07:20,603 --> 00:07:21,731
We’re going up.

69
00:07:23,427 --> 00:07:25,759
-What’s that?
-The enemy is engaging.

70
00:07:29,891 --> 00:07:31,534
<i>Move east, twelve o'clock.</i>

71
00:07:33,044 --> 00:07:35,516
<i>I think we’ve got their attention.
Here they come.</i>

72
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:42,067
Looks like we’re going
to have our hands full.

73
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,209
-It’s working.
-Engagement of one-one-eight-niner.

74
00:07:46,287 --> 00:07:47,527
Sir, we’re free and clear.

75
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:50,733
-Launch the Freedom Strike helo.
-Aye, aye, sir,

76
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,360
Launch the Helo.

77
00:07:52,464 --> 00:07:54,456
<i>Freedom Strike, you’re clear for take off.</i>

78
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:55,820
Here we go.

79
00:08:24,131 --> 00:08:25,630
<i>They’re coming around, what do we do?</i>

80
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,284
<i>Just sit tight.
Let’s see how serious these guys are.</i>

81
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:40,885
<i>Approaching insertion point.
Bearing zero-four-niner, 2 miles!</i>

82
00:08:40,965 --> 00:08:42,160
Suit up!

83
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:56,458
<i>We’ve reached the insertion point.
Prepare to disembark.</i>

84
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,941
<i>The winds are high
but our hold is steady. Good luck, guys!</i>

85
00:09:17,113 --> 00:09:18,631
<i>Big Eye, this is Freedom Strike.</i>

86
00:09:18,707 --> 00:09:21,885
<i>Assault Team is deployed
proceeding to Alpha Point Two.</i>

87
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:43,513
Sir, Eye in the Sky has picked them up.

88
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:45,439
They’re on course
for the Syrian coast line.

89
00:09:49,358 --> 00:09:51,038
<i>This asshole is taking a position
behind me.</i>

90
00:09:51,118 --> 00:09:52,881
<i>If he gets any closer
he’d better introduce himself.</i>

91
00:09:52,961 --> 00:09:53,808
<i>Hang in there, Falcon.</i>

92
00:09:53,888 --> 00:09:55,876
<i>Don’t forget
our target lock’s ineffective.</i>

93
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,271
<i>I’m going to lead the one of them away.
Let’s just keep them busy.</i>

94
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:10,933
Eye in the sky confirms deployment.
They’re taking up positions.

95
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:14,185
They’ve landed
on the Syrian beach head, Sir.

96
00:10:58,981 --> 00:10:59,960
Go!

97
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:05,392
<i>He’s on my tail, he’s on my tail.
I can’t shake him loose.</i>

98
00:11:10,298 --> 00:11:13,445
<i>-He’s going for weapons lock.
-Falcon, break hard ride, now!</i>

99
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:25,212
<i>He is still behind me.
He is gonna fire, he is gonna fire!</i>

100
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:31,704
<i>-I’ve got incoming!
-Break left! Break left!</i>

101
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:37,211
<i>That was way too close for comfort.</i>

102
00:11:39,196 --> 00:11:42,025
This could get to be
one expensive diversionary tactic.

103
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:00,686
<i>I’ve got this one in my sight.</i>

104
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,666
<i>Switching to guns,
It’s time to reach out and touch somebody.</i>

105
00:13:08,062 --> 00:13:09,654
<i>Come on, come on, get in there.</i>

106
00:13:11,776 --> 00:13:12,851
<i>Close enough.</i>

107
00:13:19,545 --> 00:13:20,598
Got you!

108
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:23,175
We have an aircraft down, sir.

109
00:13:23,255 --> 00:13:26,514
-Call in more support as soon as possible!
-Yes, sir.

110
00:14:09,871 --> 00:14:10,977
Let’s go.

111
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:43,288
Let’s go, Maddie.

112
00:15:28,638 --> 00:15:31,610
Geez, so much for a quiet break in,
let’s go!

113
00:15:39,477 --> 00:15:41,143
The fighters are still in the air.

114
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:43,388
Is this going to take long?

115
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,738
Radar jamming signal
has been aborted, sir.

116
00:15:57,818 --> 00:15:59,473
All systems are back online.

117
00:16:00,635 --> 00:16:02,298
<i>Targeting systems are back.</i>

118
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,856
<i>Okay, I've got enough of this bastard.
I’m going after him.</i>

119
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,880
<i>Here we go, I’m on his six.
He’s got nowhere to go.</i>

120
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,210
<i>I’m going for weapons lock.</i>

121
00:16:27,824 --> 00:16:31,625
<i>Oh, no you don’t.
I got you baby, you’re mine.</i>

122
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,260
<i>I got tone, I got tone.</i>

123
00:16:44,262 --> 00:16:45,378
<i>Sweet, baby, sweet!</i>

124
00:16:50,584 --> 00:16:53,796
Geez, you better speed it up, Maddie.
Come on.

125
00:16:56,605 --> 00:16:57,752
How do you know which board?

126
00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:04,090
Woman’s intuition?

127
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,039
Let’s go!

128
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,576
Get the chip out of here.
I’ll watch your backs, move!

129
00:17:30,283 --> 00:17:32,653
Help! I’m in here! Help!

130
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:35,946
Help me! Please help me!
Get me out of here!

131
00:17:36,026 --> 00:17:38,649
Lieutenant West, you are alive.

132
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,393
Shit!

133
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:43,106
Help me, I'm in here!

134
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,025
Are you okay, West? Shit.

135
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:23,342
-I thought you were dead.
-So did I.

136
00:18:24,573 --> 00:18:27,081
<i>Big Eye, this is Team Leader,
we've secured the skies.</i>

137
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,383
<i>-No sign of enemy aircraft.
-Copy, Team Leader.</i>

138
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:31,672
<i>Maintain position
and await further instructions.</i>

139
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:36,631
-Follow me, alright?
-I'm ready.

140
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,621
-Stay close.
-Alright.

141
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:42,153
<i>Freedom Strike, Freedom Strike,
this is ground team.</i>

142
00:18:42,244 --> 00:18:44,876
<i>-Request immediate extraction.</i>
-Roger, that.

143
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:51,885
I think we can get out this way.

144
00:19:14,557 --> 00:19:18,393
-Freedom Strike, what’s your location?
-I'm right on top of you, I’m coming down.

145
00:19:48,202 --> 00:19:50,302
Secure the package, I’m going back in!

146
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,042
Tom!

147
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:03,103
Gary, meet Lieutenant West.

148
00:20:03,131 --> 00:20:04,872
-I’ll be damned.
-The pleasure is mine.

149
00:20:04,963 --> 00:20:07,066
-Let’s get you out of here.
-I’m ready. Let’s go.

150
00:20:29,502 --> 00:20:30,403
I’ve got one more.

151
00:20:35,974 --> 00:20:36,819
No!

152
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,305
No, stop!

153
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,562
Let’s go, up!

154
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:25,072
<i>Big Eye, this is Freedom Strike,
Bird is in hand, repeat, bird is in hand.</i>

155
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:29,735
<i>We have one casualty, Lieutenant Nelson.
Proceeding to bingo point, over.</i>

156
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,427
-Recall all squadrons, keep me posted.
-Aye, aye sir.

157
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,247
Send down the flight-fighters.

158
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:40,179
<i>Okay Falcon, let’s see
if we can find us an aircraft carrier.</i>

159
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,806
<i>Copy that.</i>

160
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:53,906
Ready in three, two, one, cue her.

161
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:57,245
The two-year Arab Wars
officially came to a close two weeks ago,

162
00:21:57,325 --> 00:22:00,304
when US Forces took control
of downtown Damascus.

163
00:22:01,942 --> 00:22:06,664
A UN peacekeeping operation fell victim
to violent anti-treaty demonstrations...

164
00:22:06,755 --> 00:22:07,867
...today in Syria.

165
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,522
The last nation to agree to the cease-fire
has undergone several civil uprisings

166
00:22:12,616 --> 00:22:15,070
since the announcement
of the agreed-upon truce.

167
00:22:17,016 --> 00:22:20,570
Preparations are underway for
Monday’s official ending of the Arab Wars.

168
00:22:20,658 --> 00:22:24,610
Leaders of the four nations, along with
NATO officials and President Mitchell,

169
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,961
will be convening on board the USS Nimitz

170
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:29,586
for the signing
of The Arab World Peace Treaty.

171
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,250
<i>In other national news,
Lieutenant David West...</i>

172
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:37,000
<i>...feared dead after his plane was
shot down over Syria six weeks ago,</i>

173
00:22:37,084 --> 00:22:39,528
<i>was welcomed home in Washington today.</i>

174
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,312
<i>We'll be back after these messages.</i>

175
00:22:41,392 --> 00:22:43,118
<i>Hi, you’ve reached Maddie.
I’m not in right now.</i>

176
00:22:43,198 --> 00:22:44,978
<i>Leave a message and I’ll call you back.</i>

177
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:47,895
Hey Maddie, it’s me again.

178
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:52,776
I was hoping you got the invite.

179
00:22:55,261 --> 00:22:57,092
I was also hoping you’d be home.

180
00:22:58,434 --> 00:22:59,497
Well...

181
00:23:04,068 --> 00:23:09,219
I guess I hope I see you there, too.
Anyway, bye.

182
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,713
It’s just like you to be stuffing
your face.

183
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:53,029
Hey, I learned from the master.

184
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:56,088
Hey, muscle, muscle, man.

185
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:57,247
Yeah, muscle.

186
00:23:57,761 --> 00:23:58,601
All muscle.

187
00:23:59,698 --> 00:24:01,871
How you been, man? Since…

188
00:24:04,241 --> 00:24:06,053
Good, good.

189
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,365
How’s Maddie?

190
00:24:09,168 --> 00:24:10,115
No.

191
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:13,649
Oh, Maria. What did you do now?

192
00:24:14,128 --> 00:24:16,876
I don’t know. Paradise just
isn’t always perfect, you know.

193
00:24:19,113 --> 00:24:22,220
I told you this would happen.
So she’s not coming?

194
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:23,790
I don't know.

195
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,446
Hey, speak of the devil!

196
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,065
Well, you didn’t think
I’d miss history in the making, did you?

197
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:40,365
They’re starting to load up. Let’s go.

198
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,592
Paradise isn’t perfect?

199
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:52,986
And so it’s time that we as a nation,
stop and recognize those brave

200
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:57,833
but forgotten men and women
who risk their lives day after day,

201
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,459
year after year,
all in the name of safety.

202
00:25:02,285 --> 00:25:04,665
Let me be the the first to salute you,

203
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:08,158
the crossing guards of America.

204
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:10,682
Good Lord.

205
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:13,314
-I’m Norman Sears.
-And I’m Amanda Crawford.

206
00:25:13,394 --> 00:25:14,856
Thanks for joining us tonight.

207
00:25:14,936 --> 00:25:18,176
<i>Stay tuned for "Jerry Jacobs Live",
and have a pleasant evening.</i>

208
00:25:18,256 --> 00:25:19,367
<i>Good night.</i>

209
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,382
Clear.

210
00:25:21,462 --> 00:25:24,017
Stan! Stan!

211
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:26,496
Hey Amanda, really good show,

212
00:25:26,538 --> 00:25:28,982
-but I don’t have any time right now.
-Then make time.

213
00:25:29,457 --> 00:25:31,897
-What is it?
-Is it true?

214
00:25:34,139 --> 00:25:35,344
Yes, it’s true.

215
00:25:36,793 --> 00:25:39,048
I’ve been in love with you
ever since I laid eyes on you.

216
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:42,031
I’ve spoken with my wife,
and she understands completely.

217
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:46,164
That’s not funny, Stan.
How could you give it to Norman?

218
00:25:46,272 --> 00:25:47,167
He leaves in an hour.

219
00:25:47,258 --> 00:25:49,133
Hey listen,
could we talk about this later?

220
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:51,905
I’ve got to put together, a competent
camera crew to work with him over there,

221
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:53,378
and so far it’s been a disaster.

222
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:56,153
Oh, Stan, when you’re through there,

223
00:25:56,233 --> 00:26:00,378
I’ve got a few things to go over with you
about my trip. In my office.

224
00:26:00,513 --> 00:26:02,715
Excellent timing as always, Norman.
I’ll be right in.

225
00:26:03,513 --> 00:26:04,579
Hack!

226
00:26:04,674 --> 00:26:08,473
Sorry, I couldn’t hear you.
I’ve got three Emmys stuck in my ear.

227
00:26:11,715 --> 00:26:14,926
How could you?
That was mine from the start.

228
00:26:15,017 --> 00:26:17,767
I flew all over the mid-east
in God knows what conditions...

229
00:26:17,852 --> 00:26:20,431
I didn’t get married because of it,
and you give it to Norman?

230
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:22,674
Amanda, you did a kick-ass job
on the story.

231
00:26:22,746 --> 00:26:26,698
I mean it, top drawer the whole way down
but Norman’s got seniority.

232
00:26:26,777 --> 00:26:28,608
He asked to go, I’ve got to let him go.

233
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,872
That’s not fair, I bust my ass,
he gets the payoff.

234
00:26:31,952 --> 00:26:35,060
He’s only going to be here a few
more months, then he retires.

235
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,638
And I’m going to need a new lead anchor.

236
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:41,970
I thought I was the lead anchor.

237
00:26:44,643 --> 00:26:46,951
-Amanda, don’t be like that.
-Get bent!

238
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:15,285
This way, please.
The Admiral’s waiting for you.

239
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,961
Yes, thank you.

240
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:22,146
Come in!

241
00:27:26,237 --> 00:27:30,473
Tom Dickson in my stateroom,
and I don’t even have an autograph book.

242
00:27:32,755 --> 00:27:33,979
We all feel that way, sir.

243
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,516
Well, come on in and sit down.

244
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:39,259
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

245
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:41,008
-No, thank you.
-Thank you.

246
00:27:41,112 --> 00:27:42,477
How was the flight?

247
00:27:42,557 --> 00:27:44,613
Well, to be honest, a little bumpy.

248
00:27:44,683 --> 00:27:47,827
Bumpy! You’ll have to excuse
my friend here, Casey, Sir.

249
00:27:47,907 --> 00:27:50,929
You see, being a pilot himself,
he thinks he’s the only person alive...

250
00:27:51,037 --> 00:27:53,337
who can correctly fly an aircraft.

251
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:55,911
I assure you, sir, I am not that bad.

252
00:27:55,997 --> 00:27:59,201
Well as the only pilot
on this special ops mission,

253
00:27:59,294 --> 00:28:01,122
I can’t blame you
for being a little cocky.

254
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:02,917
Thank you.

255
00:28:03,037 --> 00:28:06,071
We’ve met before,
very briefly as I recall.

256
00:28:06,175 --> 00:28:07,348
I’m sorry, sir.

257
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:09,665
Madeline Reese, Admiral John Torrance.

258
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,333
Admiral,

259
00:28:11,413 --> 00:28:14,165
Madeline here was SAS,
British Special Forces

260
00:28:14,245 --> 00:28:15,148
before she got smart.

261
00:28:15,228 --> 00:28:17,517
Or ignorant,
depending on your perspective.

262
00:28:17,597 --> 00:28:20,986
Well, you had the honor
serving the Tom Dickson,

263
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:23,944
who is one of the finest men
I’ve ever served with.

264
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:28,206
I have had the first-hand experience
of his brilliance, sir.

265
00:28:30,195 --> 00:28:33,963
See, the Admiral here, he was my commander
while we were on Team Six.

266
00:28:34,075 --> 00:28:38,692
That was before Tom was named Commander
of this United States Special Ops Team.

267
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:42,631
Excuse me, sir,
but what’s up after the signing?

268
00:28:42,726 --> 00:28:44,130
Do you head back home?

269
00:28:44,218 --> 00:28:47,005
No, we stay to observe
the disarmament process.

270
00:28:47,137 --> 00:28:50,482
There are a lot of folks out there
who have invested a lot blood in this war,

271
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:51,972
and they don’t want peace.

272
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,884
We’re going to stay around
for about three months.

273
00:28:53,964 --> 00:28:58,037
Sir, speaking on behalf of the whole team.

274
00:28:58,117 --> 00:29:00,792
I just wanted to thank you very much
for the invitation.

275
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:02,024
Nonsense.

276
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:04,855
Aside from the medals
which you all will have,

277
00:29:04,935 --> 00:29:07,544
the Joint Chiefs asked
for you all be here.

278
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,222
Come on, let me give you the grand tour.

279
00:29:24,001 --> 00:29:26,531
We’re going to have
the whole thing out here.

280
00:29:26,622 --> 00:29:27,567
Flight deck.

281
00:29:28,128 --> 00:29:31,114
Flags and everything,
just like the Battleship Missouri

282
00:29:31,194 --> 00:29:32,579
at the end of World War II.

283
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:34,348
And the weather's gonna beat us up.

284
00:29:34,428 --> 00:29:35,806
We're gonna go blood on.

285
00:29:35,886 --> 00:29:37,636
With all due respect, sir,

286
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,145
I don’t see how a piece of paper
written by us

287
00:29:40,225 --> 00:29:41,821
is going to bring an end to a holy war

288
00:29:41,901 --> 00:29:44,131
that’s been raging for over 2000 years.

289
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:45,644
Captain, you may be right.

290
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:48,387
But somebody has to start
the ball rolling.

291
00:29:48,883 --> 00:29:50,092
This is the first step.

292
00:29:50,196 --> 00:29:53,658
Who knows maybe the rest
will be a little less difficult.

293
00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:07,176
Yeah?

294
00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:11,297
Oh, I’m sorry.
I shouldn’t have come calling so late.

295
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:15,116
No, it’s all right.
Would you like to come in?

296
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,967
So, what’s on your mind?

297
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:27,066
What makes you think
I’ve got something on my mind?

298
00:30:28,264 --> 00:30:31,483
Because I know that mind,
it’s always working a mile a minute.

299
00:30:33,028 --> 00:30:36,167
I just wanted to thank you,
away from the others.

300
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:40,640
I know your history with the Admiral,
so it’s obvious that he would invite you.

301
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,670
Thank you very much
for inviting the rest of us.

302
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:47,147
I wasn’t expecting it
because of our recent...

303
00:30:48,837 --> 00:30:49,854
Well…

304
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,143
Sometimes I can be a jerk.

305
00:30:56,998 --> 00:30:59,414
But I would never hold back
something someone deserved.

306
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:03,748
And you deserve this.

307
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:09,613
I should be leaving.

308
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:12,611
Yeah, you’re probably right.

309
00:31:55,366 --> 00:31:58,574
So you’re it?
From the network, camera crew?

310
00:31:59,766 --> 00:32:01,670
You must be, there’s no else around here.

311
00:32:02,729 --> 00:32:06,652
Oh, damn, is it hot.
I’m sweating right through my jacket.

312
00:32:07,023 --> 00:32:08,996
I don’t know how you people deal with it.

313
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:14,547
Do you speak English?

314
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,357
Oh, screw it.

315
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:21,435
What the hell, as long
as you point and shoot.

316
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:22,776
Come on, let’s get going.

317
00:32:25,548 --> 00:32:26,860
I’ve got a bad back.

318
00:32:32,204 --> 00:32:35,767
Amidst all the celebration
the Arab World Peace Treaty has produced,

319
00:32:35,847 --> 00:32:38,027
there is backlash to today’s signing.

320
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:42,164
<i>Syrian Leader Ahmald-Amar Sayda
was under heavy dispute</i>

321
00:32:42,255 --> 00:32:46,243
<i>for agreeing to terms which members
of his own staff called unreasonable.</i>

322
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:48,712
<i>Peace?</i>

323
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,158
<i>But at what costs?</i>

324
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,603
<i>The effects of this peace treaty...</i>

325
00:32:52,683 --> 00:32:56,324
<i>...will be more detrimental
than 10 times the aftermath of war.</i>

326
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,350
<i>In a few minutes, we’ll be going live
to Norman Sears</i>

327
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,328
<i>who’s on board the "USS Nimitz"</i>

328
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:06,480
<i>for today’s coverage
of this historical signing.</i>

329
00:33:27,617 --> 00:33:30,988
Hey, come on, come on, guy’s move it!
I smell Emmy.

330
00:33:31,068 --> 00:33:32,638
Here's your camera, sir.

331
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:38,613
Hey, here, get this shot.

332
00:33:46,327 --> 00:33:47,366
Oh, my God!

333
00:33:50,936 --> 00:33:52,219
What the hell are you doing?

334
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:54,765
-Sacred pen.
-Sacred wrist.

335
00:33:57,858 --> 00:33:58,858
Thanks.

336
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:45,603
I hope our Navy coffee
is as good as your Army stuff.

337
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:48,847
Oh, look, there are some people
I want you to meet.

338
00:34:51,065 --> 00:34:53,493
Casey, Tom, Maddie,

339
00:34:53,573 --> 00:34:56,364
this is Tyler Haynes
of the Army Special Forces.

340
00:34:56,444 --> 00:34:58,195
He’s here as a guest of the Joint Chiefs.

341
00:34:58,281 --> 00:34:59,802
-Pleasure.
-The pleasure is all mine.

342
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:02,721
Now, Major Haynes is
up for re-assignment.

343
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,851
So I thought perhaps
you two should have a talk?

344
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:06,432
That sounds good to me.

345
00:35:06,547 --> 00:35:09,982
-What are we waiting for, Admiral?
-The President is a tad late.

346
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:11,684
He's arriving by a helicopter.

347
00:35:11,764 --> 00:35:13,300
You know, for all the great Clinton,

348
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,352
you could always depend on him
being on time.

349
00:35:18,129 --> 00:35:20,852
<i>Com, this is zero-one-niner
approaching on port bow.</i>

350
00:35:20,943 --> 00:35:22,072
<i>Permission to land.</i>

351
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:25,252
<i>Zero-one-niner, you are clear to land.</i>

352
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,551
Mr President, welcome.

353
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,777
Speak of the devil.
Excuse me.

354
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:41,436
-Very good to see you.
-You too, sir.

355
00:35:42,658 --> 00:35:45,261
-Admiral.
-Mr President. Right on time.

356
00:35:46,454 --> 00:35:50,538
Minister, please sit down.
Everyone, take your seats, please.

357
00:35:51,284 --> 00:35:52,315
Thank you!

358
00:35:52,732 --> 00:35:54,898
Thank you for coming and welcome.

359
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:59,439
Welcome, to the distinguished dignitaries,

360
00:36:00,357 --> 00:36:02,080
the honored guests,

361
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:05,377
<i>and indeed to a whole world
yearning for peace.</i>

362
00:36:05,492 --> 00:36:09,986
I must tell you that it is a very great
honor for me to host this occasion.

363
00:36:10,386 --> 00:36:11,790
I first must thank

364
00:36:12,544 --> 00:36:16,477
the four great world leaders
who have made this day possible.

365
00:36:16,887 --> 00:36:18,267
When I was a young man,

366
00:36:18,347 --> 00:36:21,686
peace in the Middle East
seemed unattainable,

367
00:36:21,766 --> 00:36:23,797
rather like a dreamer’s fantasy.

368
00:36:24,861 --> 00:36:27,453
For the wisdom, the energy, the work,

369
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:30,147
and devotion of these four great leaders

370
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:32,709
have made that dream a reality.

371
00:36:33,473 --> 00:36:37,647
Now of course,
I know that this one single document...

372
00:36:38,473 --> 00:36:42,813
...is not going to erase
the many centuries of discord.

373
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:47,702
However, perhaps if we can agree
on one issue,

374
00:36:48,526 --> 00:36:51,029
other issues will not seem so far away.

375
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:55,836
There are people all over
the world today watching us,

376
00:36:55,916 --> 00:36:57,705
yearning, believing

377
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,091
that perhaps we can have
a peaceful settlement here.

378
00:37:03,727 --> 00:37:06,969
And if that is so,
perhaps there can be peace everywhere.

379
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,369
-Gun!
-Where?

380
00:37:09,211 --> 00:37:10,737
Get the President out of here.

381
00:37:12,633 --> 00:37:14,001
Stop! Stop!

382
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,787
Sound the alert! Secure all stations!

383
00:37:20,106 --> 00:37:21,690
Sir, the Syrian President
has been wounded!

384
00:37:22,352 --> 00:37:23,382
Get the medic.

385
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:32,655
Maddie, stay with me.
Casey, Tyler, that way!

386
00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:09,489
Down!

387
00:38:14,823 --> 00:38:17,139
-Maddie.
-I’m fine, I’m fine.

388
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:20,074
-Go! Go! Go!
-Wait.

389
00:38:23,936 --> 00:38:25,037
Go!

390
00:38:27,715 --> 00:38:29,815
Corporal, we need to get him to OR stat,

391
00:38:30,373 --> 00:38:32,318
He’s going into shock,
we need to do this now.

392
00:40:53,881 --> 00:40:54,917
Sayda?

393
00:40:56,417 --> 00:40:58,395
Colonel, incoming message.

394
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:15,119
Wait, don't move him.
Take her to the infirmary.

395
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:18,617
-What happened to her?
-She bumped her head, possible concussion.

396
00:41:18,697 --> 00:41:19,946
Is that bullet still inside?

397
00:41:20,037 --> 00:41:21,138
Yes, it’s about two inches deep.

398
00:41:21,218 --> 00:41:22,358
Look, he doesn’t have the time for this.

399
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,355
I need to get him to medical.

400
00:41:23,446 --> 00:41:24,558
He has a massive amount
of internal bleeding.

401
00:41:24,638 --> 00:41:25,867
He’s not going anywhere.

402
00:41:25,947 --> 00:41:28,459
That bullet contains
an explosive element of some kind.

403
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:30,362
If you go in there blind
or make the slightest wrong move,

404
00:41:30,442 --> 00:41:31,612
you may trigger it to pop.

405
00:41:32,903 --> 00:41:35,396
-Okay, supply room now.
-Okay, easy.

406
00:41:37,234 --> 00:41:40,776
<i>Com, this is Admiral Torrance,
get the President out of here now.</i>

407
00:41:40,911 --> 00:41:43,760
<i>Yes, sir, the eagle’s on the pad.
It’s about the lift off.</i>

408
00:41:55,598 --> 00:41:56,579
We need to keep him stable

409
00:41:56,659 --> 00:41:58,411
until we find out exactly
what’s inside of him, okay?

410
00:42:02,202 --> 00:42:04,552
Look, if we can’t take him to medical,
we’re going to bring the medical to him.

411
00:42:04,632 --> 00:42:06,638
I need an IV, a respirator, the works.

412
00:42:09,592 --> 00:42:11,378
My gun! Thank you.

413
00:42:16,483 --> 00:42:17,749
Dickson!

414
00:42:20,115 --> 00:42:21,138
I lost him.

415
00:42:21,218 --> 00:42:23,211
-Can you give me your gun?
-I got it right here.

416
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:25,113
Let's go.

417
00:42:29,452 --> 00:42:30,294
Did you find them?

418
00:42:30,374 --> 00:42:32,821
Dickson found one
but no luck on the other.

419
00:42:32,921 --> 00:42:35,714
There are a million places
he could hide on a ship like this.

420
00:43:03,031 --> 00:43:04,097
Freeze!

421
00:43:21,133 --> 00:43:22,195
Lets go.

422
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:29,819
Not much is known at this hour.

423
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:31,886
President Mitchell,
rushed off the aircraft carrier,

424
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,387
moments after conveyed
his deepest condolences,

425
00:43:34,459 --> 00:43:36,556
for the breakdown of the treaty signing.

426
00:43:36,636 --> 00:43:40,481
He wished for all sides to put
this event aside as soon as possible,

427
00:43:40,561 --> 00:43:42,533
and to resume the peace process.

428
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:46,876
-Anything further from Shaval?
-Negative, Colonel.

429
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:50,606
I wonder if President Sayda’s
alive or dead?

430
00:43:51,266 --> 00:43:53,139
It doesn’t matter one way or the other.

431
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:56,146
If he is alive,
he is being held against his will.

432
00:43:56,281 --> 00:44:00,396
If he is dead, they’ll have to assume
full responsibility.

433
00:44:00,476 --> 00:44:03,237
Either way, our objective
remains the same.

434
00:44:03,902 --> 00:44:06,997
President Sayda’s condition
maybe a good opportunity for propaganda.

435
00:44:07,593 --> 00:44:09,291
But the nuclear weapons center

436
00:44:09,371 --> 00:44:13,186
remains our only means of bargaining
with the Americans.

437
00:44:13,827 --> 00:44:16,794
Captain, I don’t want to take any chances.
Get those birds in the air now.

438
00:44:17,603 --> 00:44:18,976
I’ll report to Central.

439
00:44:48,494 --> 00:44:50,326
Any new information?

440
00:44:50,406 --> 00:44:52,784
The battle group is securing the region.

441
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:54,343
And the assassins?

442
00:44:54,452 --> 00:44:57,306
One confirmed dead,
the second one jumped off the ship.

443
00:44:57,404 --> 00:45:00,062
SER teams are in the water now
searching for the body.

444
00:45:00,179 --> 00:45:01,063
President Mitchell?

445
00:45:01,143 --> 00:45:02,885
He’s on board Air Force One
and heading home.

446
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:06,462
Alright, I want to step up security
in the Gulf for the time being.

447
00:45:06,542 --> 00:45:08,235
This may only be an isolated incident

448
00:45:08,315 --> 00:45:11,223
but we don’t want
to be caught with our pants down again.

449
00:45:11,303 --> 00:45:12,456
Yes, sir.

450
00:45:18,436 --> 00:45:21,429
<i>Two-zero-seven, this is Two-zero-one.
Any signs of life out there?</i>

451
00:45:22,447 --> 00:45:25,328
<i>Negative, Coast One.
Nothing out there but blue sky.</i>

452
00:45:25,408 --> 00:45:28,135
<i>Roger that. We’ll head back.
Let Dragon Squadron take the limelight.</i>

453
00:45:28,215 --> 00:45:29,283
<i>Roger that.</i>

454
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,929
-How are you feeling?
-Fine.

455
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,505
I think I’ve got every drug
loaded to my gun inside me.

456
00:46:03,363 --> 00:46:05,739
Which accounts
for my euphoric disposition.

457
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:12,380
-How’s everything in the real world?
-Fine.

458
00:46:13,867 --> 00:46:15,640
You sound as convincing as me.

459
00:46:17,494 --> 00:46:21,147
Well, good news is we got the bad guys.

460
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,526
Bad news is, we don’t know
the who, where or why’s.

461
00:46:25,588 --> 00:46:27,181
All the important stuff.

462
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:31,539
You look tired.

463
00:46:35,127 --> 00:46:37,752
Why don’t you just rest up a little bit,
I’ll be back.

464
00:46:46,738 --> 00:46:48,806
-Tom?
-What is it?

465
00:47:00,663 --> 00:47:01,758
Thank you.

466
00:47:17,303 --> 00:47:20,589
Amanda, wait up!
Where do you think you’re going?

467
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,954
Sizzler! All you can eat salad bar
ends at 11.

468
00:47:24,745 --> 00:47:26,110
Where do you think I’m going?

469
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:28,382
I should have been there
in the first place.

470
00:47:28,462 --> 00:47:30,071
It was Norman’s crew that took the shot.

471
00:47:30,151 --> 00:47:31,839
If I had been there,
like I should have been,

472
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:33,197
the peace treaty would have been signed

473
00:47:33,277 --> 00:47:35,034
because I would have checked
their credentials

474
00:47:35,114 --> 00:47:37,076
and not made an ass out of myself!

475
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:38,485
Now, I’m leaving tonight

476
00:47:38,543 --> 00:47:41,548
I’ll be in the Gulf in the morning,
and I'm going to win my Emmy.

477
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:43,365
Amanda.

478
00:47:45,897 --> 00:47:48,764
Amanda, I need you here. I’m warning you!

479
00:47:49,671 --> 00:47:51,932
Alright, you’d better get me
some good stuff then.

480
00:47:57,195 --> 00:47:58,387
I hate my job.

481
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:05,154
<i>My friends, yesterday was to have been
one of the world’s finest hours.</i>

482
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,569
<i>Alas, it was not.</i>

483
00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:13,124
<i>An assassination attempt was made
by an unknown group and failed yesterday,</i>

484
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:15,429
<i>aboard the "USS NIMITZ".</i>

485
00:48:15,509 --> 00:48:21,389
<i>Unfortunately, President Abdul Amil Sayda
was wounded in the chest.</i>

486
00:48:22,253 --> 00:48:24,084
<i>Although, details are sketchy,</i>

487
00:48:24,164 --> 00:48:27,849
<i>we believe the perpetrators may
have been renegade factions</i>

488
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:31,058
<i>from within the president’s
own country, Syria.</i>

489
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:35,035
<i>Safety measures will not allow
the president to be moved</i>

490
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:36,445
<i>until he has stabled.</i>

491
00:48:37,262 --> 00:48:40,820
<i>Let me assure you,
that despite this cowardly act,</i>

492
00:48:40,913 --> 00:48:45,200
<i>the US and Syrian governments
remain firmly committed to peace.</i>

493
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,558
<i>Soon as new information is available,
I shall share it with you, of course.</i>

494
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:50,934
<i>Thank you.</i>

495
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:56,548
I mean, they had all the proper ID’s.

496
00:48:58,009 --> 00:49:02,268
I’ve picked up foreign crews
hundreds of times over the years,

497
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,082
and I’ve never had any trouble.

498
00:49:05,013 --> 00:49:09,664
When I turned around, and I saw that gun,

499
00:49:10,462 --> 00:49:12,261
I didn’t know what to do.

500
00:49:14,641 --> 00:49:16,973
This guy doesn’t even have the stomach
to be a terrorist.

501
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,049
-Now what?
-Let the FBI have him.

502
00:49:21,141 --> 00:49:22,587
He’s all yours, gentlemen.

503
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,320
They’ve got to have on video
of these guys entering the room.

504
00:49:28,411 --> 00:49:31,005
With all the cameras that were there
plus security, I’d say so.

505
00:49:32,018 --> 00:49:33,924
Well, maybe we can isolate the image,

506
00:49:34,015 --> 00:49:36,310
feed it off to Langley,
and see what we’ve got on the guy.

507
00:49:37,202 --> 00:49:40,096
I’ll call Lieutenant Green, and get him
to send up the available footage.

508
00:49:40,176 --> 00:49:41,183
Good.

509
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:09,819
<i>We have the right to know the truth.</i>

510
00:50:10,414 --> 00:50:13,761
<i>It was enough
that we came down to their level.</i>

511
00:50:13,884 --> 00:50:18,312
<i>Agreeing to a deal that was unjustly
balanced against our beliefs,</i>

512
00:50:19,038 --> 00:50:20,315
<i>But we did.</i>

513
00:50:20,786 --> 00:50:25,040
<i>We did it for hope
and the promise of peace.</i>

514
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:28,935
<i>What is our thanks?</i>

515
00:50:29,948 --> 00:50:31,386
<i>We are spat in the face.</i>

516
00:50:32,372 --> 00:50:33,657
<i>Belittled.</i>

517
00:50:34,542 --> 00:50:38,209
<i>The Americans have not given us
one straight answer.</i>

518
00:50:39,029 --> 00:50:42,590
<i>We do not know what is
and what is not the truth anymore.</i>

519
00:50:42,946 --> 00:50:46,332
<i>Whether our president is alive, dead.</i>

520
00:50:47,004 --> 00:50:48,707
<i>Nothing!</i>

521
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:52,397
That son of a bitch is making us out
to be the bad guys.

522
00:50:52,513 --> 00:50:54,272
We have received several inquires, sir

523
00:50:54,363 --> 00:50:56,593
from many nations regarding
the Syrian Leader situation.

524
00:50:57,171 --> 00:50:59,943
They want to know exactly what events
transpired aboard the "NIMITZ".

525
00:51:00,644 --> 00:51:03,055
Alright, I want a secure line
to "NIMITZ", ASAP.

526
00:51:03,135 --> 00:51:04,681
I want to know Sayda’s condition.

527
00:51:04,768 --> 00:51:06,470
Everything else is on a need-to-know basis

528
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:09,197
until I know what statement
the President is going to make.

529
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:11,909
Also, get in communication
with this Rama character,

530
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,001
or whoever else is in charge,
before this thing blows out of control.

531
00:51:15,092 --> 00:51:16,128
Yes, sir.

532
00:51:19,446 --> 00:51:21,622
Tom, you have anything yet?

533
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,239
-Still looking. Any news on Sayda?
-I was about to check.

534
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:30,142
Lieutenant Blakely.

535
00:51:30,245 --> 00:51:32,304
<i>This is Admiral Torrence. Any changes yet?</i>

536
00:51:32,414 --> 00:51:33,524
Negative. He is stable.

537
00:51:33,604 --> 00:51:35,736
But we are waiting for the lab analysis
of the other bullet

538
00:51:35,816 --> 00:51:37,103
before we proceeding any further.

539
00:51:37,183 --> 00:51:39,301
<i>-Alright, keep me posted.</i>
-Yes, Admiral.

540
00:51:45,634 --> 00:51:47,063
Got it.

541
00:51:48,373 --> 00:51:50,020
A clean image of both terrorists.

542
00:51:51,707 --> 00:51:54,718
-Let’s get it into Washington right away.
-Yes.

543
00:51:59,663 --> 00:52:03,356
I assure you, Colonel, we’re doing
everything possible that can be done.

544
00:52:03,436 --> 00:52:05,400
I’m afraid that’s just not going to do.

545
00:52:06,183 --> 00:52:08,955
If you were serious about peace, sir,

546
00:52:09,082 --> 00:52:12,067
<i>you would be doing
much more to restore our faith.</i>

547
00:52:12,173 --> 00:52:13,708
And how could I do that?

548
00:52:13,788 --> 00:52:17,218
I want hourly report
on his health and not from you,

549
00:52:17,713 --> 00:52:19,800
from someone directly on the carrier.

550
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:21,756
No more middlemen.

551
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:24,361
I’ll see what I can do.

552
00:52:26,535 --> 00:52:27,770
Brilliant, sir.

553
00:52:27,861 --> 00:52:30,903
They’ll never suspect this is
just a decoy for our real plan.

554
00:52:45,915 --> 00:52:47,137
Yeah.

555
00:52:51,631 --> 00:52:53,765
The images of the assassins
are coming in, sir.

556
00:53:01,748 --> 00:53:03,189
Run that through the mainframe.

557
00:53:03,295 --> 00:53:06,290
I want to cross-reference it with every
known militia or terrorist group.

558
00:53:06,356 --> 00:53:07,385
Yes, sir.

559
00:53:20,161 --> 00:53:21,505
Stan, it’s Amanda.

560
00:53:21,906 --> 00:53:23,682
-Where are you?
<i>-Damascus.</i>

561
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:26,874
Listen, I started talking to this man
sitting next to me on the plane...

562
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:28,307
Was he sick?

563
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:29,574
<i>No, why?</i>

564
00:53:29,654 --> 00:53:32,144
Well, I always get stuck next to guy,
with bubonic plague or something.

565
00:53:32,224 --> 00:53:33,565
He’s always sneezing

566
00:53:33,645 --> 00:53:35,303
<i>or telling me his, whole life
story all within about two...</i>

567
00:53:35,383 --> 00:53:37,306
Shut up and listen, Stan.

568
00:53:37,408 --> 00:53:40,692
About 10 miles from here, there’s a weapon
center that the UN has taken over.

569
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:43,800
I found out, it had just become
capable of launching nukes

570
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,326
<i>when this peace treaty stuff came down.</i>

571
00:53:45,406 --> 00:53:47,382
And nobody knows this, Stan!

572
00:53:47,495 --> 00:53:50,467
-Well how does the healthy man know this?
-<i>His nephew’s in the military.</i>

573
00:53:51,014 --> 00:53:52,660
So why is he telling you
the family secrets?

574
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,611
I paid him 8,000 piastres.

575
00:53:55,993 --> 00:53:57,199
Good God, Amanda, that’s...

576
00:53:58,613 --> 00:54:00,374
Actually, I have no idea how much that is.

577
00:54:00,454 --> 00:54:01,708
<i>Could you bargain for 4,000?</i>

578
00:54:01,816 --> 00:54:03,304
Good bye, Stan.

579
00:54:07,798 --> 00:54:09,398
I could really love her.

580
00:54:10,505 --> 00:54:11,776
Get me accounting.

581
00:54:12,444 --> 00:54:14,158
How much is 8,000 piastres?

582
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:22,597
What is this?

583
00:54:23,007 --> 00:54:25,948
Wish that whoever designed this
was on our side.

584
00:54:26,915 --> 00:54:27,984
What have we got?

585
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:32,129
Oh, not much, just a regular 25 shell
right here except for the tip,

586
00:54:32,219 --> 00:54:33,316
which can I call a beanie.

587
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:36,326
The metallic compound found inside
this beanie, right here,

588
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:37,944
is explosive by nature.

589
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:40,934
But it’s only harmful
when the two elements come together.

590
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:44,028
One of which is this green stuff
right here that looks like paint.

591
00:54:44,138 --> 00:54:46,072
-But it’s not.
-No, it’s not.

592
00:54:46,184 --> 00:54:49,405
Actually, it’s some sort of a solvent
which acts with the trigger effect,

593
00:54:49,465 --> 00:54:55,541
when it comes into contact with something
real hard like concrete or steel.

594
00:54:55,678 --> 00:54:57,627
-Bone?
-Bone, exactly.

595
00:54:57,726 --> 00:55:01,702
This thing right here causes a spark,
which creates the explosion.

596
00:55:01,807 --> 00:55:04,549
So there should be
no problem taking this bullet out?

597
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:07,723
-I don’t think it’s going to be that easy.
-Why not?

598
00:55:07,803 --> 00:55:10,292
Well, we don’t know
what kind of state it’s in now, sir.

599
00:55:10,802 --> 00:55:13,069
The slightest movement
or scrape could set it off.

600
00:55:13,149 --> 00:55:14,683
-Correct?
-That’s right.

601
00:55:15,649 --> 00:55:16,599
What could be done?

602
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:19,233
You’re going to have to diffuse the bullet
before you extract it.

603
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:21,031
Can that be done?

604
00:55:21,133 --> 00:55:23,163
Probably, but it’s going
to take some time.

605
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,908
That’s one thing we don’t have?

606
00:55:27,075 --> 00:55:29,615
Look, the longer that man sits here
with that bullet inside of him,

607
00:55:29,706 --> 00:55:31,416
the more at risk he becomes.

608
00:55:31,505 --> 00:55:34,627
Lieutenant, if President Sayda dies,

609
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:37,008
so does all chance of peace in this area.

610
00:55:40,642 --> 00:55:42,587
Kabala, this is Rama.

611
00:55:42,667 --> 00:55:44,807
<i>Launch Operation Aerial Diversion.</i>

612
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:48,134
<i>We will be proceeding towards the weapons
center as soon as the jets are airborne.</i>

613
00:55:48,225 --> 00:55:49,008
Yes, Colonel.

614
00:56:23,658 --> 00:56:26,109
Hey, good afternoon, how are you doing?

615
00:56:30,515 --> 00:56:35,464
I have four unknown aircraft.
100 miles, at 140, at 300 knots, sir.

616
00:56:37,523 --> 00:56:40,633
<i>Control tower, this is command center.
Green light the birds immediately!</i>

617
00:56:40,777 --> 00:56:41,814
Yes, sir.

618
00:56:56,259 --> 00:56:59,196
Yes, Mr President, I’ll have it for you
as soon as it comes in.

619
00:56:59,673 --> 00:57:00,685
Yes, sir.

620
00:57:01,187 --> 00:57:03,377
Sir, reports have come back
on the ID terrorists.

621
00:57:03,457 --> 00:57:05,418
I think you should see
who their commander is.

622
00:57:07,081 --> 00:57:08,414
Is this information correct?

623
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:11,946
Yes, sir. The assassins were taking orders
from Colonel Abdul Rama.

624
00:57:18,367 --> 00:57:19,470
Get me the President.

625
00:57:22,917 --> 00:57:25,446
<i>Big Eye this is Ghost One.
I have multiple contacts.</i>

626
00:57:25,501 --> 00:57:28,745
<i>Bearing 081, 60 miles, 16,000 feet.</i>

627
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,387
<i>Nose Eye, that is confirmed.</i>

628
00:57:34,976 --> 00:57:38,299
<i>Big Eye, bandit, bandit, red in frame,
two of them just broke formation.</i>

629
00:57:38,379 --> 00:57:39,621
<i>They’re coming right at us.</i>

630
00:57:39,701 --> 00:57:41,893
<i>Roger that 201, stay on course.</i>

631
00:57:42,332 --> 00:57:43,298
Get me the CO.

632
00:57:48,849 --> 00:57:49,835
Admiral Torrence.

633
00:57:52,195 --> 00:57:53,367
I’ll be right there.

634
00:57:54,349 --> 00:57:56,966
The Syrian jets
just crossed the no-fly zone.

635
00:57:57,046 --> 00:57:58,952
Check and see what the doctor
need in terms of assistance.

636
00:57:59,032 --> 00:58:00,341
I’m going with Torrence.

637
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,052
Good?

638
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:06,825
<i>Ghost One, do you see this?</i>

639
00:58:06,952 --> 00:58:08,880
<i>Okay, we’ve got him, Falcon.
Let’s just keep our heads.</i>

640
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,533
<i>Approaching 30 miles.
Increase speed up to 500 knots.</i>

641
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:13,766
<i>-We’ve got 10 miles closure.
-Copy that.</i>

642
00:58:15,342 --> 00:58:17,218
As soon as those hornets are ready,
I want them airborne.

643
00:58:17,298 --> 00:58:18,426
Aye, aye, sir.

644
00:58:19,032 --> 00:58:20,129
<i>Here we go.</i>

645
00:58:25,344 --> 00:58:28,120
-Check points secured?
-Yes, Colonel, all check points secured.

646
00:58:28,654 --> 00:58:29,683
Go!

647
00:58:32,277 --> 00:58:33,518
Everyone, down!

648
00:58:38,924 --> 00:58:40,784
<i>Ghost Two, sorting left-hand bandit.</i>

649
00:58:40,901 --> 00:58:43,116
<i>Roger that, I’ve got one in behind.
He’s coming around.</i>

650
00:58:45,926 --> 00:58:47,773
<i>Break away,
he’s going target missiles lock!</i>

651
00:58:47,853 --> 00:58:49,863
<i>Falcon, where are you? He’s all over me.</i>

652
00:58:56,925 --> 00:58:58,295
Stop! Stop!

653
00:59:07,162 --> 00:59:09,889
<i>He’s stuck to me like a glue.
I can’t shake him, damn it!</i>

654
00:59:17,602 --> 00:59:18,793
<i>He’s going for weapons lock.</i>

655
00:59:23,562 --> 00:59:26,820
<i>-He’s got a lock on me.
-Falcon, break hard right, now!</i>

656
00:59:33,701 --> 00:59:35,077
<i>Shit, that was close!</i>

657
00:59:35,168 --> 00:59:37,038
<i>Hang in there.
I’m going to try to get behind him.</i>

658
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:43,543
<i>Come on, you bastard.</i>

659
00:59:46,945 --> 00:59:48,553
<i>I got him. I’m going for missile lock.</i>

660
00:59:57,125 --> 00:59:58,169
<i>Come on baby, lock.</i>

661
01:00:00,474 --> 01:00:02,545
<i>I got sweet lock, baby,
switching to missiles.</i>

662
01:00:08,595 --> 01:00:10,168
<i>That one made it.</i>

663
01:00:10,439 --> 01:00:12,384
<i>Alright, now,
let’s see what his friend is up to.</i>

664
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:46,308
Secure the perimeter.
And back some cover.

665
01:00:46,388 --> 01:00:47,998
The rest stay with me.
We’re going in.

666
01:00:54,647 --> 01:00:55,816
Move! Move!

667
01:01:21,727 --> 01:01:22,882
<i>Okay, he’s following me.</i>

668
01:01:22,962 --> 01:01:24,786
<i>I’m going to lead him
into your line of fire.</i>

669
01:01:32,217 --> 01:01:34,429
<i>Shit. As soon as you have a shot,
take it, Falcon!</i>

670
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:37,064
<i>If you're clear, Hollywood,
I think I can get it.</i>

671
01:01:41,449 --> 01:01:42,527
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

672
01:01:46,217 --> 01:01:48,275
<i>Here we go. Come on, come on, lock!</i>

673
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,735
<i>I got lock!</i>

674
01:01:57,005 --> 01:01:58,005
<i>Look at him go!</i>

675
01:02:01,397 --> 01:02:04,390
<i>There’s a new sheriff in town.
The other two are still out there, Falcon.</i>

676
01:02:04,481 --> 01:02:07,024
<i>Let’s just wait and see what they do
before we make a move.</i>

677
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:16,382
This is Amanda Crawford
in a "ZNN Exclusive".

678
01:02:16,515 --> 01:02:18,388
We’re coming to you
from the Syrian Weapons Center,

679
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:20,014
just outside Damascus

680
01:02:20,094 --> 01:02:21,100
where around the clock,

681
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:25,038
workers diligently labor to disable
the nuclear launch code program

682
01:02:25,118 --> 01:02:27,703
executed by Syrian technicians
during the war.

683
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:30,164
What was that?

684
01:02:34,262 --> 01:02:37,549
This facility is now the property
of the Syrian Government.

685
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,878
-What’s that?
-Info on the terrorists.

686
01:02:50,289 --> 01:02:53,177
Admiral, ring any bells?

687
01:02:58,684 --> 01:03:01,502
Karbala, operation close down.

688
01:03:01,593 --> 01:03:03,568
Recall and stand by.

689
01:03:03,689 --> 01:03:06,047
Yes, Colonel. Recall!

690
01:03:13,451 --> 01:03:16,045
<i>Big Eye, this is Ghost One.
Remaining bandits are bugging out.</i>

691
01:03:16,178 --> 01:03:17,491
<i>I think we spooked them.</i>

692
01:03:17,588 --> 01:03:20,045
<i>Copy, Ghost One.
Stand down and return home.</i>

693
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:21,161
<i>Roger that.</i>

694
01:03:24,658 --> 01:03:25,498
Yes.

695
01:03:26,477 --> 01:03:27,317
Right.

696
01:03:28,267 --> 01:03:29,934
Bring up A-57 on the map.

697
01:03:33,249 --> 01:03:35,232
-What’s that?
-A stress signal.

698
01:03:35,352 --> 01:03:38,160
-From where?
-Syrian Weapons Center.

699
01:03:41,644 --> 01:03:42,761
It’s a decoy.

700
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,543
It’s a decoy.

701
01:03:51,663 --> 01:03:52,836
Okay.

702
01:03:53,582 --> 01:03:55,616
General, we have
Center Com on the "Nimitz" on line.

703
01:03:55,696 --> 01:03:56,640
Admiral.

704
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,746
<i>Tom Dickson is here
at your request, General.</i>

705
01:03:59,874 --> 01:04:01,073
Good, thank you.

706
01:04:01,153 --> 01:04:02,571
I don’t know if you’re aware
of this or not,

707
01:04:02,644 --> 01:04:05,855
but early today while our jets
were engaging the Syrians,

708
01:04:05,935 --> 01:04:07,237
<i>a weapons center in Damascus</i>

709
01:04:07,328 --> 01:04:10,420
under guard
by the United Nations was taken over.

710
01:04:11,354 --> 01:04:14,385
This facility contains
nuclear capabilities

711
01:04:14,465 --> 01:04:16,561
not yet dismantled by UN officials.

712
01:04:17,568 --> 01:04:18,977
Our best Intel tells us

713
01:04:19,057 --> 01:04:22,930
that it could be fully operational
within 12 to 18 hours.

714
01:04:23,022 --> 01:04:26,076
<i>Our prime suspect is the man
in the photograph we sent you.</i>

715
01:04:26,212 --> 01:04:28,037
-Colonel Rama.
<i>-Precisely.</i>

716
01:04:28,123 --> 01:04:29,012
Rama’s made it clear

717
01:04:29,092 --> 01:04:32,019
that he was not in favor of his
country’s intentions to end the war.

718
01:04:32,137 --> 01:04:33,650
He’s win-at-all-costs colonel.

719
01:04:33,765 --> 01:04:35,249
Our sources have him connected

720
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:37,758
with starting many of the
anti-treaty terrorists groups,

721
01:04:37,854 --> 01:04:39,447
as well as bombing and Tel Aviv.

722
01:04:39,558 --> 01:04:42,217
And we believe that Colonel Rama,
planted the assassins.

723
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:45,798
Damn, that’s the same lunatic
that’s been on ZNN all day berating us,

724
01:04:45,867 --> 01:04:47,316
for not protecting their leader.

725
01:04:47,912 --> 01:04:49,677
These are massive manipulations here.

726
01:04:50,174 --> 01:04:51,443
He’s planting the seed,

727
01:04:51,523 --> 01:04:53,952
that we’re the bad guys
in the world’s eyes.

728
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:57,058
More importantly, sir,
in his country’s eyes,

729
01:04:57,152 --> 01:05:00,017
<i>Giving them a logical excuse
to start the war back up again.</i>

730
01:05:00,811 --> 01:05:04,632
So, he not only has the motivation
for war,

731
01:05:05,304 --> 01:05:07,814
he has the devices
for starting it himself.

732
01:05:53,878 --> 01:05:54,941
Excuse me.

733
01:05:55,397 --> 01:05:59,100
Hello, I don’t know
if you’re familiar with my work.

734
01:06:01,472 --> 01:06:04,465
I’m Amanda Crawford.
I’m a news reporter.

735
01:06:04,604 --> 01:06:06,805
If you allow me to say so, sir.

736
01:06:06,885 --> 01:06:09,618
I completely understand
your side of this.

737
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:13,076
-You do?
-Absolutely. I feel your pain!

738
01:06:13,192 --> 01:06:18,926
If you would let me, I would love to do an
exclusive expose on you and your people.

739
01:06:19,023 --> 01:06:21,293
I think the world needs to know.

740
01:06:26,623 --> 01:06:28,423
These people make me sick.

741
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:32,470
The world will know my story
soon enough without your help.

742
01:06:32,953 --> 01:06:34,593
-Take them outside.
-Yes, Colonel.

743
01:06:43,052 --> 01:06:44,082
Yeah?

744
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:46,713
Yeah, I’ll be right there, boss.

745
01:06:47,524 --> 01:06:48,557
Yeah?

746
01:06:49,657 --> 01:06:50,793
She’s doing better.

747
01:06:51,943 --> 01:06:52,929
Alright.

748
01:06:54,269 --> 01:06:55,428
I got to go, sugar.

749
01:06:56,005 --> 01:06:57,026
What’s going on?

750
01:06:57,116 --> 01:06:59,456
I don’t know,
but I’ve heard that tone before.

751
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:01,643
-Let me know?
-Positively.

752
01:07:05,385 --> 01:07:06,426
We’ve got him.

753
01:07:06,528 --> 01:07:07,634
Mr President?

754
01:07:07,749 --> 01:07:09,983
-Are Cent Com on the "NIMITZ" tied in?
-Yes, sir.

755
01:07:10,111 --> 01:07:10,952
We’re here, sir.

756
01:07:12,337 --> 01:07:13,270
Mr President?

757
01:07:15,596 --> 01:07:17,960
-President Michelle here.
-Mr President.

758
01:07:18,538 --> 01:07:20,781
I wish we could be speaking
on better terms.

759
01:07:21,473 --> 01:07:24,191
Due to your recent unprovoked attack
on our country,

760
01:07:24,303 --> 01:07:28,843
we have no option but to assume
that your request for peace is no longer.

761
01:07:28,959 --> 01:07:32,685
Unprovoked? I believe that your aircraft
fired on our first.

762
01:07:32,837 --> 01:07:34,481
I beg to differ.

763
01:07:35,371 --> 01:07:37,185
I have no choice but
to report you to NATO

764
01:07:37,265 --> 01:07:40,116
for violating
the cease-fire agreement.

765
01:07:40,196 --> 01:07:41,566
Well, that shouldn’t
be too big of a problem.

766
01:07:41,646 --> 01:07:45,694
We have a contingent stationed
at the Weapons Center Damascus.

767
01:07:46,171 --> 01:07:49,044
Weapons center?
I know not of what you speak.

768
01:07:49,171 --> 01:07:51,187
I hear in your voice, however,

769
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:53,808
that you truly care to make amends
for your actions.

770
01:07:53,924 --> 01:07:55,986
That makes me very happy, sir.

771
01:07:56,077 --> 01:07:57,794
What are you proposing?

772
01:07:57,941 --> 01:08:01,132
The immediate withdrawal
of all UN forces from my country.

773
01:08:01,767 --> 01:08:04,980
<i>And the swift and safe return
of President Sayda.</i>

774
01:08:05,071 --> 01:08:07,785
You know very well,
the man cannot be moved.

775
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:09,563
And how can I trust you?

776
01:08:10,538 --> 01:08:13,042
If my demands are not met, Mr President

777
01:08:13,182 --> 01:08:17,285
I will create problems
that you cannot possibly fathom.

778
01:08:19,753 --> 01:08:22,782
You have 12 hours.

779
01:08:27,276 --> 01:08:29,009
<i>Stay on the line, Admiral.</i>

780
01:08:30,967 --> 01:08:32,980
Mr President, there is not doubt
in my mind

781
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:34,648
that no matter what we do,

782
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:37,558
he is going to launch his nukes,
as soon as he is capable.

783
01:08:37,673 --> 01:08:39,306
I don’t think we have any choice.

784
01:08:39,674 --> 01:08:42,470
We should launch a full
strike immediately.

785
01:08:42,629 --> 01:08:46,595
I’m not going to start this war
again because of a hunch, General.

786
01:08:46,759 --> 01:08:49,391
<i>Sir, our best intelligence men,</i>

787
01:08:49,519 --> 01:08:53,489
all CIA profiles, any and all signs
all say the same thing.

788
01:08:53,661 --> 01:08:56,387
This lunatic is not going to reason,
he’s not going to bargain,

789
01:08:56,467 --> 01:08:58,767
he’s going to launch
as soon as he’s capable.

790
01:08:58,909 --> 01:09:03,545
Sir, you said it yourself,
he has the motivation and the devices.

791
01:09:05,573 --> 01:09:07,900
Before I fire missiles, General

792
01:09:08,033 --> 01:09:11,564
I must be sure that
we’ve exhausted every possibility.

793
01:09:12,058 --> 01:09:14,023
<i>Mr President, there may be another way.</i>

794
01:09:14,171 --> 01:09:16,710
We don’t have much time
before they’re completely operational,

795
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:18,708
I’d like to volunteer my team to go in.

796
01:09:19,619 --> 01:09:21,616
Commander, your bravery is duly noted,

797
01:09:21,742 --> 01:09:25,091
but I have short-ranged
nuclear armed warheads

798
01:09:25,171 --> 01:09:27,093
pointing all over Europe and Asia.

799
01:09:27,177 --> 01:09:29,332
There's simply isn’t enough time
for strike force to go in

800
01:09:29,412 --> 01:09:30,832
while we wait for result.

801
01:09:30,912 --> 01:09:33,216
Sir, I wasn’t suggesting you wait.

802
01:09:33,844 --> 01:09:36,231
If we’re not out
by the determined strike time...

803
01:09:36,348 --> 01:09:40,481
Commander, you are putting your life
and the lives of your men in jeopardy.

804
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:44,534
Sir, there are a lot of lives
at stake here,

805
01:09:44,654 --> 01:09:47,703
American lives, if we don’t at least
make an effort.

806
01:09:56,341 --> 01:09:58,517
What are we waiting for?
Give the devil his due.

807
01:10:01,943 --> 01:10:03,257
Okay, get me command.

808
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:06,015
-I want to go.
-I was counting on that.

809
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:08,329
Head down with Casey, start gear check.

810
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:10,471
We’ll meet in the ready room in 10.

811
01:10:55,258 --> 01:10:56,259
I’m going with you.

812
01:10:56,362 --> 01:10:59,480
-Absolutely not, out of the question.
-Why?

813
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,968
I’m not going to risk you out there,
not in your condition.

814
01:11:03,084 --> 01:11:05,708
Tom, this is as much my team
as it is any of the others

815
01:11:05,788 --> 01:11:07,585
and I’m not sitting this one out.

816
01:11:10,822 --> 01:11:12,869
I’m not going to make
the same mistake twice.

817
01:11:13,995 --> 01:11:17,300
Well the doctor’s given me
a clean bill of health, a mild concussion.

818
01:11:18,384 --> 01:11:21,805
Tom, I know what I’m getting myself into,
and if you’re going in, I’m going in, too.

819
01:11:26,613 --> 01:11:29,197
Besides, exactly how are you going
to shut down a weapons mainframe

820
01:11:29,277 --> 01:11:31,813
without a technology expert
along for the ride?

821
01:11:36,362 --> 01:11:38,633
We come in right here,
just north of Damascus.

822
01:11:39,415 --> 01:11:41,298
Okay, we leave in 15 minutes.

823
01:11:42,067 --> 01:11:44,027
Sweep One will locate
the weapons control room.

824
01:11:44,118 --> 01:11:45,849
Sweep Two the hostages.

825
01:11:45,982 --> 01:11:47,325
Tyler, you’ll have a new partner.

826
01:11:47,416 --> 01:11:50,243
One of the Admiral’s Navy Seals
is going to be your point man.

827
01:11:50,386 --> 01:11:52,002
Who’s going to stay with you?

828
01:11:56,962 --> 01:11:59,968
-Man, are you crazy?
-We need her to disable the system.

829
01:12:00,871 --> 01:12:04,667
I wouldn’t put myself or the team at risk
if I wasn’t 100 percent certain.

830
01:12:06,975 --> 01:12:08,254
Welcome back.

831
01:12:11,527 --> 01:12:12,374
Admiral?

832
01:12:14,445 --> 01:12:19,396
Alright, UN Intel correlates
with our most recent TARPS Pod imagery.

833
01:12:19,862 --> 01:12:21,092
Fences line the building.

834
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:26,089
Satellite photos reveal 10 or 20 guards
outside at any give time.

835
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:30,187
They seem to be working in shifts,
so we should be able to find a hole.

836
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:34,337
You have four hours and 15 minutes
until they are fully operational,

837
01:12:35,564 --> 01:12:37,688
and we have to let one country sign.

838
01:12:38,148 --> 01:12:42,164
Now, there is no set detention center,
at least not one that we know of,

839
01:12:42,308 --> 01:12:46,460
which means the hostages
can literally be anywhere.

840
01:12:46,544 --> 01:12:48,597
We don’t know how many soldiers
are in the facility.

841
01:12:48,724 --> 01:12:51,202
So discretion is a top priority.

842
01:12:51,303 --> 01:12:54,214
Also, we don’t want them pushing
the panic button

843
01:12:54,305 --> 01:12:56,909
before we destroy the mainframe
to keep them from launching.

844
01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:59,624
Got it.
They won’t even know we’re there.

845
01:13:29,797 --> 01:13:31,036
Go.

846
01:14:43,397 --> 01:14:45,407
Don't worry ma'am, were the good guys.
Come on!

847
01:14:45,487 --> 01:14:48,792
Come on, come on! Come on,come on.
Follow us. Let's go! Let's go!

848
01:14:48,925 --> 01:14:49,876
Let's get out of here.

849
01:14:52,671 --> 01:14:56,138
Okay. There it is. I’ll watch your back.

850
01:14:58,235 --> 01:15:01,788
In the middle of a mission,
they keep radio silence with the outside

851
01:15:01,894 --> 01:15:04,187
so that we are unable to contact them.

852
01:15:04,838 --> 01:15:09,500
If anything, and I mean, anything
happens out of the ordinary,

853
01:15:09,583 --> 01:15:11,169
report to me before firing.

854
01:15:13,579 --> 01:15:16,509
I know this isn’t an easy assignment
for any of you.

855
01:15:17,493 --> 01:15:19,091
But it is for the greater good.

856
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:21,860
God be with you.

857
01:16:58,973 --> 01:17:00,324
Oh, shit.

858
01:17:25,009 --> 01:17:27,618
<i>Big Eye, this is Ghost One,
I’m ready for final checks.</i>

859
01:17:27,723 --> 01:17:28,840
<i>20 minutes and counting.</i>

860
01:17:29,023 --> 01:17:31,343
<i>I’ll be approaching Syrian air space
in 10 minutes.</i>

861
01:17:31,456 --> 01:17:34,777
<i>Roger that, Ghost One.
Maintain speed and course.</i>

862
01:18:05,006 --> 01:18:07,909
Hey, so much for a quiet get away.
Come on, come on!

863
01:18:43,812 --> 01:18:44,965
Shit.

864
01:18:45,075 --> 01:18:47,525
Okay, okay.

865
01:18:50,082 --> 01:18:52,761
<i>Big Eye this is Ghost One.
I’m entering Syrian air space,</i>

866
01:18:52,803 --> 01:18:54,976
<i>advancing to designated
target coordinates.</i>

867
01:18:55,072 --> 01:18:57,378
<i>Roger, Ghost One.
Proceed with caution.</i>

868
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:03,450
They have 10 minutes.

869
01:19:25,444 --> 01:19:28,249
<i>Target coordinate set.
Entering data into the computer.</i>

870
01:19:44,096 --> 01:19:45,618
-How's it going?
-Okay.

871
01:19:46,091 --> 01:19:48,192
-Is it working?
-Maybe.

872
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:50,866
Madeline, we don’t have
a lot of time here!

873
01:19:52,174 --> 01:19:53,778
Do you want me to stop
and explain this to you,

874
01:19:53,858 --> 01:19:55,945
or do you want me to shut down
the thermos-nuclear missiles?

875
01:19:57,487 --> 01:19:59,684
-The missiles.
-Good choice.

876
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:14,254
Come on! Come on! Come on!

877
01:20:14,334 --> 01:20:16,916
Come on. Let’s go, let's go, let's go!
Come on, come on. Let’s go.

878
01:20:17,561 --> 01:20:19,420
<i>Big Eye, target is visible on radar.</i>

879
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,419
<i>I’ll be within firing range
in three minutes.</i>

880
01:20:22,633 --> 01:20:24,766
<i>Copy, Ghost One, stay on course.</i>

881
01:20:49,645 --> 01:20:50,485
Come on.

882
01:20:52,605 --> 01:20:53,468
Yes!

883
01:20:59,422 --> 01:21:00,597
Got it!

884
01:21:02,501 --> 01:21:03,647
<i>Big Eye, this is Ghost One.</i>

885
01:21:03,738 --> 01:21:05,881
<i>Requesting final clearance
for weapons release.</i>

886
01:21:05,972 --> 01:21:08,553
<i>Stand by, Ghost One.
They still have two minutes.</i>

887
01:21:10,681 --> 01:21:12,033
Don’t we have a call to make?

888
01:21:18,343 --> 01:21:23,695
It was supposed to be a New World Order,
but once again you’ve drained me.

889
01:21:23,811 --> 01:21:27,604
You may have won the war,
but it’s going to cost you your life.

890
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:36,976
<i>Ghost One, this is Big Eye,
you are go for weapons release.</i>

891
01:21:37,064 --> 01:21:38,955
<i>Repeat, you are go for weapons release.</i>

892
01:21:39,474 --> 01:21:40,633
<i>Copy that, Big Eye.</i>

893
01:22:00,228 --> 01:22:03,910
-You okay?
-Yeah, you?

894
01:22:04,547 --> 01:22:05,894
He’s tough guy to kill, huh?

895
01:22:08,450 --> 01:22:09,509
Apparently.

896
01:22:09,619 --> 01:22:14,710
This is for you.

897
01:22:24,776 --> 01:22:26,141
Shit.

898
01:22:27,023 --> 01:22:28,223
Run!

899
01:22:37,616 --> 01:22:41,612
-Pretty sure he’s dead this time.
-Yeah, I think you’re right.

900
01:22:45,771 --> 01:22:47,452
<i>Big Eye, I’m on final approach.</i>

901
01:22:47,532 --> 01:22:49,977
<i>Weapons system on line.
Arming missiles.</i>

902
01:23:02,047 --> 01:23:03,702
<i>Big Eye, this is Sweep One.</i>

903
01:23:03,793 --> 01:23:06,481
<i>Mission accomplished.
Nuclear threat aborted.</i>

904
01:23:06,572 --> 01:23:09,027
-Yeah!
-<i>Recall the birds.</i>

905
01:23:09,117 --> 01:23:12,795
-Recall those squadrons, abort mission.
-Thank God they did it!

906
01:23:12,945 --> 01:23:15,658
<i>Ghost One, this is Big Eye. Disengage.
Repeat, disengage.</i>

907
01:23:15,738 --> 01:23:17,398
<i>Stand down and return home.</i>

908
01:23:17,501 --> 01:23:19,660
<i>Roger that, Big Eye. I’m heading home.</i>

909
01:23:26,352 --> 01:23:28,723
This is Freedom Strike,
what’s your position?

910
01:23:28,814 --> 01:23:32,529
<i>I’m heading out on the north.
I’ll be on deck in 60 seconds.</i>

911
01:23:35,568 --> 01:23:38,078
Affirmative, we’re on our way.

912
01:23:38,983 --> 01:23:40,351
Come on, let’s get out of here, come on.

913
01:23:40,431 --> 01:23:41,750
-Okay.
-Come on.

914
01:23:52,533 --> 01:23:53,550
Got it.

915
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:55,638
Be careful, that thing
could still be hot.

916
01:24:05,729 --> 01:24:08,892
And after several failed attempts,
today marked the completion

917
01:24:08,983 --> 01:24:10,507
of the Arab World Treaty.

918
01:24:11,011 --> 01:24:13,060
President Mitchell was quoted as saying,

919
01:24:13,170 --> 01:24:17,281
"Today will be a day long remembered
in the history of the modern world."

920
01:24:19,017 --> 01:24:20,915
We thank you for joining us tonight.

921
01:24:21,453 --> 01:24:23,773
Stay tuned for my special expose,

922
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,413
"Hostage: The Amanda Crawford Story".

923
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:29,825
This special takes you
through the odyssey of my capture,

924
01:24:29,948 --> 01:24:33,162
to how I was able to help comfort
my fellow prisoners.

925
01:24:33,845 --> 01:24:35,501
<i>This is Tom leave a message.</i>

926
01:24:36,588 --> 01:24:40,250
<i>Tom, it's Tyler.
I'm calling to see how you were doing.</i>

927
01:24:40,389 --> 01:24:43,138
<i>Anyway, I know you’re probably
going through some awkward times at home,</i>

928
01:24:43,218 --> 01:24:45,308
<i>about Maddie being transferred.</i>

929
01:24:45,403 --> 01:24:47,743
<i>I just want to let you know
I’m there for you.</i>

930
01:24:48,290 --> 01:24:50,136
<i>Hey, how about a trip to Vegas?</i>

931
01:24:50,256 --> 01:24:52,955
<i>It'll help you live
to get your mind off something</i>

932
01:24:53,062 --> 01:24:55,411
<i>Let me know. I’ll see you.</i>

933
01:24:57,944 --> 01:24:59,110
Do you think we should tell the boys?

934
01:25:00,444 --> 01:25:02,388
No. It’s more fun like this.
