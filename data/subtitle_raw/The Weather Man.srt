1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,827
That was refreshing.

3
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,790
I'm refreshed.

4
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,669
I'm refreshing.

5
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,815
Welcome back. I'm Bryant Gumbel.

6
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,650
And I'm Anne Howard.
Good stuff today.

7
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,319
We're going to be busy.
We've got pop superstar Elton John.

8
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:52,362
He's going to be with us.

9
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,406
And so, too,
will best-selling author Al Franken.

10
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,366
Along with some
super-smart fourth graders...

11
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,326
...with a great idea
for getting schoolbooks...

12
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,703
...to kids who really need them.

13
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,246
But here's an idea
whose time has come.

14
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,331
Why don't we just start with...

15
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,795
...and fill the tart shell.

16
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,507
Bryant, you put some ice cream
on our angel food cake...

17
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,510
How much do you want?
As much as you like.

18
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,699
What are you laughing about?
This is Baked Alaska.

19
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,285
This is supposed to be low-fat.
It is!

20
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,578
Did they call?

21
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:45,290
Someone from the show.
The Gumbel show. They didn't call?

22
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,708
Are you sure?

23
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,794
Once again, we're out of time.
Thank you. Already?

24
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,631
We still got lots more ahead
this morning. We're going to be back...

25
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,787
What's up, dude?
Next person in line.

26
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,038
What's up?

27
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:29,417
Hey, can I get your autograph?
Next in line.

28
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,254
I'm not who you think I am, so...

29
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,423
You're not the weather guy?

30
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,841
Dan Spritz?

31
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,218
Dave Spritz.

32
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,388
I'm not Dave Spritz, no.
But I hear that a lot.

33
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,438
You don't have to be a dick.

34
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:56,277
Look, can you just...
All right, I'm just waiting in line.

35
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,865
Bro, I can read
your vehicle registration form.

36
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,159
So, whatever.

37
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,495
Can you...

38
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:10,542
All right, can you give me a break?
I just wanted to wait in line.

39
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,629
You're on TV, bro.

40
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,965
You're on TV.

41
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,261
You're on TV, bro.
So what? You keep saying that.

42
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,470
So you're on TV, bro.

43
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,847
Go work in a bank or something...

44
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:25,265
...if you don't wanna be cool to people.

45
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,018
Whatever. Just...
Can you get out of my face?

46
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,854
Can you get out of my face?

47
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,527
Asshole.
You want to say that to my face?

48
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,072
I thought you wanted me
to get out of your face.

49
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,117
People recognize me sometimes.

50
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,038
Some are dicks.

51
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,667
This is the same system that created
those strong snowfalls in Minnesota.

52
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,210
It's meant some
slightly warmer weather...

53
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,421
...I should cool out a little, I guess.

54
00:04:56,546 --> 00:05:00,216
I mean, I'm not just this
two-dimensional guy they recognize.

55
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,719
I do have a relationship to them.

56
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,472
I let them know
what they have to deal with.

57
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,350
But listen, these warmer temperatures
are not going to last.

58
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,644
This wind system will keep pushing
colder air across the Midwest...

59
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,855
I guess that's why
they think they know me.

60
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,190
But they don't, really.

61
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,485
...our Spritz Nipper of the week
with a high of just 24.

62
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,196
I'm not a hill of beans.

63
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,698
I have a plan.

64
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,368
Okay, see you then.

65
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,703
What's this afternoon?
You're picking up Shelly.

66
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,330
Where?
Chicago Dance.

67
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,207
Then you're taking your dad
to Northwestern.

68
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,249
At 3:00?

69
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,919
Do you have that Hello America stuff?

70
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,462
The letter?
Yeah.

71
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,715
You have Mike, too.
5:30 at the Norris house.

72
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,800
Okay.

73
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,902
Do they have my cell phone?

74
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:04,072
Well, they should have
all the numbers in case.

75
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,116
And am I supposed to call
that guy Dersen?

76
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,910
Didn't he want me to call to touch base?

77
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,453
Okay.

78
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,958
Dad, can we stop here?
What for?

79
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,169
I need a notebook for school.

80
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,091
I'll just walk home.

81
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,886
Okay.

82
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,932
Can I have some money?
You don't have any?

83
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,100
No.

84
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,226
You're 12 years old.

85
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,771
You shouldn't be walking around
without money, okay, Shelly?

86
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,314
You're not a kid.

87
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,817
How's your mom doing?
She's good.

88
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,493
Can I have a pack of Lights?

89
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,912
Regulars?
The 100s.

90
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,294
Strikes?

91
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,616
How's Shelly?

92
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,201
She's doing great.

93
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,245
Little angel.
Yeah.

94
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,622
She's doing great.

95
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,627
Who's an angel?
Shelly.

96
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,713
Shelly is grossly overweight
and unhappy.

97
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,883
I'm concerned about her,
as I am Michael.

98
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:49,219
David.
Yeah, Dad.

99
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,039
Robert Spritzel?

100
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,254
Would you get me a paper...

101
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,381
...for the way back, Son?
Yeah.

102
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,757
Fifteen minutes?

103
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,176
Yes. I'll see you then.

104
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,395
Fuck.

105
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,148
Hey.
Hey.

106
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,900
It's getting cold.
Yeah.

107
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:50,238
What's the Nipper this week?
Thursday.

108
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,366
Thursday's the Nipper? All right.

109
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,960
Here.

110
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,881
Yeah, can I get some change?

111
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,674
Not really.

112
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,595
Can I just get some quarters?
I just need a quarter for a paper.

113
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,013
Not really.

114
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,099
All right. I'll get something then.

115
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,103
All right.

116
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,484
Small coffee.

117
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,528
It's 80 cents.

118
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,364
No, it says $0.72.

119
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,492
After the whole everything, it's $0.80.

120
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,290
Hey.
Hi.

121
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,335
Where's the paper, David?

122
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,088
I didn't have enough money.

123
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,590
You bought a coffee.

124
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,843
What?
You bought a coffee.

125
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:59,224
Yeah, that, and then I didn't have
enough money after.

126
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:00,934
What?

127
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,689
I didn't have enough money
after I bought the coffee, so...

128
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,483
You should carry more than $1, David.

129
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,068
You're a grown man.

130
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,033
Let me just move this letter
from Hello America.

131
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,904
My father is Robert King Spritzel.

132
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,325
He won the National Book Award
when he was 28.

133
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,911
And the Pulitzer when he was 33.

134
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:04,664
President Carter called him
a national treasure.

135
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:07,250
They played racquetball
in a regular game.

136
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,003
He was a great writer.

137
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,131
But what was the cost?

138
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,800
Did he neglect his family?

139
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,260
No, he didn't.

140
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,596
He was a fine father.

141
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,890
More than that, really.

142
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,059
It's fruitless for Shelly to be dancing.

143
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:28,730
She should find another interest
that would be more rewarding to her...

144
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,274
...that she can take more from, David.

145
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,736
We've talked about that.
Well, you should do something, Son.

146
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:38,156
We've tried a couple things.
We'll keep trying, so...

147
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,283
How's Michael?

148
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,078
I think that was an overreaction
on Noreen's part.

149
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,830
I don't think he has a problem with pot.

150
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,582
Let's hope.

151
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,543
How's the weather business?

152
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,098
Last September...

153
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:07,268
...I had encouraged Shelly to explore
some other activities and interests.

154
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,729
She picked archery.

155
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,400
So I took her to an archery range
in Bolingbrook.

156
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,360
It was a 90-minute drive.

157
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,240
We purchased a junior bow-arrow kit...

158
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,534
...and a leather wrist/forearm guard.

159
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,452
Okay, we'll take that.

160
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,413
And private lessons.

161
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,961
All right, Shelly.

162
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,879
You take that one...

163
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,133
...and go right ahead.

164
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,185
All right. Okay, just remember...

165
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,480
...pull it straight back,
parallel to your ear, okay?

166
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,566
You can do it, Shelly.

167
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,368
We purchased a five-pack lesson plan.

168
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,454
We haven't been back.

169
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:16,129
Hello?

170
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:17,505
Hey.
Hey.

171
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,675
Can you pick up Mike
at the mall on North?

172
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,887
I thought he was at a friend's house.
Paul Norris.

173
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,056
They went to the mall.
He just called me.

174
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:28,516
He finished his rehab.
Okay.

175
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,360
That's one of my counselors.
In your program?

176
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,362
Don Boden. He's pretty nice.

177
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,740
He swears all the time, though.
Swears?

178
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,951
Yeah. To relate, I guess.
But he's pretty nice.

179
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,464
Hey, Don.

180
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,467
What are you guys doing?
Looking for clothes.

181
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,969
You're just looking for clothes.

182
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,931
Yeah.
That's great.

183
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,725
I'm looking for clothes.

184
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,686
Okay.

185
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,397
This is Paul.
What's up?

186
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,481
Hey.

187
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,484
It's cold today.

188
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,277
Yeah.
Yeah, no kidding.

189
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,238
What is it, like, 20 or something?

190
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,531
Yeah, like 22.

191
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,033
Yeah. Fuck.

192
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:28,118
Yeah.

193
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,830
Hey.

194
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,582
Yeah, I like this.
It's good-looking.

195
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,836
Yeah, I've been looking
for something like this.

196
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,255
Chuck it in here.

197
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,925
What?
Chuck it in.

198
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,845
I'm loading up. I got a discount card.
I'll get it for you.

199
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,763
That's all right.
Mike, big deal.

200
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,558
I can get it.
Bro, I got a serious discount.

201
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,727
It's gonna cost, like, $7.

202
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:02,235
I'm gonna take off. Nice to meet you.
You, too.

203
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,784
That's my dad. I'll see you later.

204
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,662
Sure. I'll catch you later.

205
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,591
Hey.
Hey.

206
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,969
Who's that?
Don Boden.

207
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,306
Who's Don Boden?
He's one of my counselors.

208
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,390
Oh.

209
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,935
That's a nice sweater.
Thanks.

210
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,495
I'll walk you up.

211
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,665
Hi.

212
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,168
Hi. Thanks for getting Mike.

213
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,837
Hey, how was your thing?
It was good.

214
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,923
I'll see you, Dad.
Okay, Mike.

215
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,969
I think he's gonna be okay.
Well, we'll see.

216
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,767
What's new?

217
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:17,519
Nothing much.

218
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,105
I got a feeler from Hello America.

219
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,065
What?
I got a feeler.

220
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,026
Dales is leaving it.
I might get called to audition.

221
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,403
New York.

222
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,739
If I get called.
That's good.

223
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,535
What about the kids?

224
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,663
It's just a shot in the dark, that's all.

225
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,208
Well, thanks for getting Mike.

226
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,378
I had to take my dad
to Northwestern for a test...

227
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:45,547
...so I was right there, anyway.

228
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,800
Oh, is he okay?
I think so. It was just a test.

229
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,689
Noreen!

230
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,402
Are you okay?

231
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,697
Yeah.

232
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,532
Fuck! What are you doing?

233
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,618
I was just... You turned into it.

234
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,079
I think you cracked the glass.

235
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:32,761
So do you have everything you need?

236
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,179
Yeah, we got everything.

237
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:37,265
We'll pare it down to three applicants
after we watch the tapes.

238
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:39,601
We'll call if you're one, Dave.
Okay, Mark.

239
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,269
It's nice to make your acquaintance.

240
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,729
You, too. Take care.
Hey, weatherman!

241
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:43,897
All right. Bye.

242
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,981
Fuck!

243
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:48,818
Fuck.

244
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,070
David?

245
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,154
Hey.

246
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:55,450
What happened?
I got hit with a Frosty.

247
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,786
Why?
What?

248
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:01,748
Why did you get hit with a Frosty?
What is a Frosty?

249
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:05,460
A Frosty is a shake from Wendy's.

250
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,922
Why would someone throw
a shake at you?

251
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,260
That happens sometimes.
People throw shakes at you?

252
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,846
Stuff. People throw stuff
at me sometimes...

253
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,682
...if they don't like me, or something.

254
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,433
They don't know you.

255
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,810
From TV.

256
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,312
But you just read the weather.

257
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,148
Well, I predict it.

258
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,818
You don't have a degree in meteorology.

259
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:32,278
I make suppositions, or I...

260
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,614
What are you doing?

261
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:37,742
I walked over.
You walked? It's freezing.

262
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:40,495
I have lymphoma, David.

263
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,247
What?

264
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,041
I have lymphoma.

265
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,295
Doctor Pritch called.
What?

266
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,425
I was having tremors.
That's the reason that I went in.

267
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,927
Pritch read my scans.

268
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:00,807
What's the prognosis?
Well, it's not good.

269
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,853
We'll talk about it this week.
I wanted to tell you.

270
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,312
Yeah.

271
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:10,859
I'll call you
after I've talked to Pritch again.

272
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:16,239
I'll drive you home.

273
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,034
I like the fresh air.

274
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,870
Well, I'll walk back with you.
No, that's okay.

275
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,082
Okay.

276
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:50,357
Every couple months,
someone throws something at me...

277
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:53,401
...a shake, a burrito once.

278
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:57,572
Why? My name, partly, I guess.

279
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,949
I changed it for professional reasons.

280
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,786
My first station manager suggested it.

281
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:06,623
He said it sounded refreshing
and that they wanted that quality.

282
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:10,251
That may be true, but it's also annoying.
I know that.

283
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,088
What kind of name is Spritz?

284
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:17,425
It's a bullshit name. It's a TV name.

285
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,636
He's bullshit.

286
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,222
Well, I like him. He's handsome.

287
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,307
He's an asshole.

288
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,893
I don't like his face.

289
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,020
His asshole face.

290
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,901
The other thing, my job is very easy.

291
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,238
Two hours a day,
basically reading prompts.

292
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:44,285
I make $240,000 a year...

293
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,829
...plus appearances...

294
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:51,126
...which are, you know,
not comfortable for me...

295
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:53,420
...but lucrative.

296
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,673
"Four score and seven years ago..."

297
00:20:57,173 --> 00:21:00,510
"...our fathers brought forth,
on this continent..."

298
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,646
Also, it makes other things easy,
being on TV.

299
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:14,816
Everything's easy.

300
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:18,319
Yeah!

301
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:30,540
I receive a large reward for pretty much
zero effort and contribution.

302
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:34,169
The shakes and stuff
are a reaction to that, I think.

303
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,019
What must you think of me?

304
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:52,937
Your family-leaver.

305
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,774
Your non-meteorologist,
yet weatherman...

306
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:58,318
...frosty-taking, fuck-happy son.

307
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:04,240
Don't die yet, Robert.
Give me time to get it together.

308
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:06,034
Give me a little while.

309
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:09,579
Let me get the Hello America job.
I can get it together.

310
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:44,489
Two for High Water.

311
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,783
I got mine, Don.
No, it's cool. I got it.

312
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:47,992
Thanks.

313
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,932
Tricia's a bitch.

314
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,352
She's a little cunt.

315
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,855
I hate that little cunt.

316
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:21,359
I'd like to burn her.

317
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:32,871
Hi.

318
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,205
Hi.

319
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,002
Today's the company party.
I thought I'd take the kids.

320
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,086
Oh.

321
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:43,214
Well, Mike is out.

322
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:46,384
Shelly's home?
She's walking Jackson.

323
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:50,013
Where do you want to take them?
The rink. WCH.

324
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:52,932
Hey.

325
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:56,853
Hey.

326
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:58,688
What?

327
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:07,489
Dave.

328
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,199
Hey, Tim.

329
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:12,410
I didn't know you were coming.
I always come to these...

330
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,079
...when I can.

331
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:19,668
I have some time this week if you want
to go back up to Bolingbrook.

332
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:23,630
What's in Bolingbrook?
Sportsman's. The archery range.

333
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,633
Okay.
Okay? You wanna go?

334
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:28,843
Okay, I remember it.

335
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:31,513
Well, do you wanna go back up?

336
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:33,556
Sometimes.

337
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,736
What's gonna happen?

338
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:48,780
What?

339
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,157
What are we gonna do here?

340
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:57,163
Great stuff.

341
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:08,341
Ladies and gentlemen, on your marks!

342
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,760
Let's go team Spritz!

343
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:12,303
Get set!

344
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:14,264
Go!

345
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,518
Go! Go! Go!

346
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:21,396
Just keep up, Shell. Come on.
I'm trying to.

347
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,710
We should finish.

348
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:46,880
We're last. We're way last.

349
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:50,300
There's a lesson here. Let's finish.

350
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:51,593
I'm hurt.

351
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,304
Hon, you can do it.
You can finish. Okay?

352
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:57,932
I don't want you to quit.
It's gonna mean a lot to Dad. Okay?

353
00:25:58,433 --> 00:25:59,476
All right.

354
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:01,603
Let's go.

355
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,731
That's my girl. That's it.

356
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:06,775
Good. I'm proud of you.

357
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:08,401
Okay?

358
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:18,328
Yay! That was great!

359
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:21,956
Hon. Hon, you okay?

360
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:24,417
You shouldn't have made me finish!

361
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:27,045
That was like 100 yards
you made me go.

362
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:29,714
I'm not a football-jocker.

363
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:36,596
What happened?

364
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,848
Just... We got tangled up in a sack.

365
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:41,017
What happened?
She tore her ACL.

366
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:43,228
These fucking crutches are too long!

367
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,021
What did you say?
Shelly!

368
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:49,901
Well, what were you doing?
It was a picnic.

369
00:26:50,026 --> 00:26:52,821
And she tore something?
ACL. MCL.

370
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:54,155
Which?

371
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,491
Both.

372
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:58,827
Dave!
Well, we didn't go bungee jumping!

373
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:00,704
It was a fucking potato-sack race!

374
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:02,997
That's where she got it.
What?

375
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,041
"Fucking" this. "Fucking" that.

376
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,835
No, I never said that around her.

377
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:10,755
You don't know you have, Dave,
because you don't pay attention!

378
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:12,757
Fuck that.

379
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,676
What?

380
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:17,429
Just fuck that, Noreen. You know...
Dave.

381
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:19,180
What?
Step back.

382
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,599
Step back?
Step back.

383
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,185
What are you talking about, Russ?

384
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:26,604
Russ...
Step back right now.

385
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:30,692
Fuck you, right now.
Fuck you, Spritz.

386
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,819
Fuck you, fat asshole!

387
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:34,487
Dildo!

388
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:37,365
David, what are you doing?

389
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,576
I'm talking to my wife!
I'm talking to Noreen...

390
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:41,411
...and this clown,
whose business this isn't.

391
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:44,080
You call me a dildo,
it is my business, Spritz.

392
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:47,667
You are a dildo, pork-fuck. You porker!

393
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:49,210
Stop, Son.

394
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:50,545
Would you?

395
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,130
Why don't you go?

396
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:55,508
Why are you here? Are you okay?

397
00:27:55,592 --> 00:27:57,594
I came to talk to Noreen.

398
00:27:58,428 --> 00:28:01,139
Dave, come on. I will talk to you later.

399
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,939
Dave, what's going on, Son?
It's nothing. Just...

400
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:11,900
Why are you here, anyway?

401
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:15,570
I came to talk to Noreen
about an issue concerning Shelly.

402
00:28:15,945 --> 00:28:19,866
Well, you can talk to me.
I'm her parent, too. So? What?

403
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:24,037
Shelly dresses in clothing
not appropriate for her...

404
00:28:24,371 --> 00:28:25,872
...clinging stuff.

405
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:29,501
All kids wear...
Dad, it's a different generation.

406
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,003
They call her camel toe.

407
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:36,174
What?
Are you aware of that?

408
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:37,717
What?

409
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:40,387
That her colleagues call her camel toe.

410
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,763
What are you talking about?

411
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:43,682
It means the crease in her vagina...

412
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:46,101
...that they can discern
through her clothing.

413
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:47,811
What?
Camel toe.

414
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,605
Yeah, I heard you.
I mean, how do you know they do that?

415
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,856
I heard it.

416
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:57,028
I picked Shelly up on Wednesday,
heard taunting, the older boys calling it.

417
00:28:57,153 --> 00:28:59,364
You might have heard wrong.
No, I heard camel...

418
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:00,907
Okay, okay, look. I'll deal.

419
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,492
I want to get her through this ACL thing.

420
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:03,702
I'm gonna take her shooting.

421
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:04,828
I'm gonna reapply her there.

422
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:07,288
I'm gonna get her talking to me.
I'm gonna get to her...

423
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,332
...and I'm gonna work it out.

424
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:29,602
A camel toe is pretty much
what Robert said it was.

425
00:29:32,856 --> 00:29:36,776
It's basically just when you
can make out more than you should.

426
00:29:40,196 --> 00:29:42,240
But it's the kind of thing...

427
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:44,034
She's 12, you know?

428
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,995
If you're around and paying attention,
you catch it...

429
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,041
...then name-calling doesn't start,
and maybe smoking doesn't start.

430
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:55,462
And maybe she can just stay
a happy kid for a couple more years.

431
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,589
She shouldn't be unhappy.

432
00:29:57,714 --> 00:30:02,344
Fuck. What did she ever do
to anybody? Shelly.

433
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,522
Hello.
Hey.

434
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:16,816
Hey.

435
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,109
Listen.

436
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,527
Noreen, I was thinking...

437
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:22,197
...this pushing and pulling...

438
00:30:22,947 --> 00:30:24,866
...the tug-of-war we do sometimes...

439
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:27,160
...it's not good for the kids.

440
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:28,370
It's not.

441
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:33,083
Noreen, let's see somebody.
Work it out. Let's...

442
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,793
Fuck!
Asshole!

443
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:37,545
Are you okay?

444
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,049
I got hit with a pop!
What?

445
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:43,551
A fucking...

446
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:46,763
A Big Gulp.

447
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:51,226
Man.
Are you okay? Are you okay?

448
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:53,478
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. So...

449
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,397
...what I was saying...

450
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:57,982
See somebody?

451
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:02,404
We're going to begin
with some trust-building exercises.

452
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:05,198
The Buddy Drop. Up on your feet.
Let's go.

453
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:09,327
Dave, Noreen. Center circle.

454
00:31:13,206 --> 00:31:14,249
Okay.

455
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:18,628
Now, Noreen,
you're just gonna let yourself go...

456
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:21,339
...and Dave is gonna catch you.

457
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:24,718
Just go back?
Yeah. Cross your arms up front.

458
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:27,512
Now?
Whenever you're ready.

459
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:28,888
Okay.

460
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,019
Good. Very good.

461
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:36,563
All right, Teresa, Mark. You're up.

462
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:37,772
Okay.

463
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:42,152
Now I want you to name something...

464
00:31:42,652 --> 00:31:46,448
...that you did that affected your partner...

465
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,908
...and that you're not proud of.

466
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:54,581
I had this thing with porno
on the computer, sort of.

467
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:55,999
I got a little preoccupied...

468
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:58,752
Actually, I want you to write it down,
not say it.

469
00:31:58,835 --> 00:31:59,836
Okay.

470
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,630
I want you to put it on the paper
that you got for a reason.

471
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:03,673
Okay.

472
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:09,804
Now make sure it's something
the other person doesn't know about...

473
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:11,973
...that they don't know.

474
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:22,734
All right.

475
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:26,154
Then you are going to give it
to the other person...

476
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:30,992
...and the other person
is never going to look at it.

477
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:33,495
Ever.

478
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:35,830
That's trust.

479
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:04,734
What's up?

480
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:19,207
I thought Dave's science-fiction novel,
or whatever it was...

481
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:20,792
...was stupid and sucked...

482
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:22,877
...and was a waste of time.

483
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:25,922
It was embarrassing. Four years?

484
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:47,110
Well, I thought that went pretty well.

485
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:49,029
Yeah.

486
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,626
It wasn't science fiction,
just so you know.

487
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:06,588
What?
It wasn't science fiction.

488
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:09,299
What are you talking about?
Did you even read it?

489
00:34:09,424 --> 00:34:11,760
No. One of the side characters
was a scientist...

490
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:14,387
...but that's not even important...
God damn it, Dave. God damn it!

491
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:17,349
What? I'm just asking,
did you ever even read it?

492
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:20,185
It was hard to read.
It was poorly written.

493
00:34:20,643 --> 00:34:22,645
You're an asshole. God.

494
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:25,565
You are a champion asshole.

495
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:28,276
You're a real blue-ribbon fuck!

496
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:33,823
I just wanna make it work, Noreen.

497
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:38,078
I just want to know everything,
so I can make it work. That's why I...

498
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:42,207
I want to try again.
I'm not going back. You fucked it up.

499
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:44,292
I mean, our marriage.

500
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:45,752
What?

501
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:52,425
I want to try again.

502
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:55,845
Fuck you.

503
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:58,807
You know, Dave, you can't even...

504
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:03,687
You looked at it. That's dishonest.
It's crappy.

505
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:05,397
Noreen.
Hey, should I look at yours?

506
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:06,940
That's all right.

507
00:35:07,023 --> 00:35:08,525
No. No, no, Noreen...

508
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:12,987
"Throughout marriage
BJ's lacked enthusiasm."

509
00:35:13,363 --> 00:35:16,116
"Had difference of opinion
over how important that was."

510
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,534
"I thought very."

511
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:21,871
You know what, Dave?

512
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:27,043
You want to know
why my BJ's lacked enthusiasm?

513
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:29,504
I hated you.

514
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:32,007
I hated your hair.

515
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:35,510
I hated your ugly legs, your forearms.

516
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:39,180
I hated kissing your lips, Dave. Okay?

517
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:43,351
And that's why I lacked enthusiasm
when your cock was in my mouth.

518
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:46,938
Hey, hon.

519
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:50,608
Shelly, it's cold.

520
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:54,195
Your father said it was going to be
65 degrees today, but...

521
00:35:57,907 --> 00:36:00,076
Go ahead. I'll see you later.

522
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,703
How did it go?

523
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:03,329
Good.

524
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:07,417
I'll call you tomorrow. Go ahead in.

525
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,310
Did you start my novel yet?

526
00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:27,771
What's that?

527
00:36:28,313 --> 00:36:31,024
Breaking Point. Did you start that?

528
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:35,070
No, I haven't yet, Son.
I've been preoccupied.

529
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,283
Well, that's good, actually.

530
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:43,453
I want to make some changes, so...

531
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:46,289
I'll give you the new one.

532
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:04,140
What did he say?

533
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:06,476
It's further bad news.

534
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:09,521
The metastatic plane
was too wide for radiation.

535
00:37:11,439 --> 00:37:15,402
He suggested I see a Dr. Frost
in New York for clinical trials.

536
00:37:27,956 --> 00:37:30,291
I got a feeler from Hello America.

537
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:31,793
National.

538
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:34,963
They're looking at 20 guys, but
they'll be cutting down to three soon.

539
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:36,798
It's a possibility.

540
00:37:36,881 --> 00:37:39,634
The salary's great. It's real strong.

541
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:43,930
It would mean moving...

542
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:46,349
...but I'd like to move everybody,
you know?

543
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:48,435
Renew things with Noreen.

544
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:50,854
We've been seeing somebody.

545
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:56,401
Let the kids start over in New York.

546
00:37:57,193 --> 00:38:00,822
Keep them away from some
of the bad influences here that...

547
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:02,782
Just get a fresh start.

548
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,578
I think that would be great.

549
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:09,581
That would be terrific.
Yeah.

550
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,835
You could rededicate yourselves,
knuckle down.

551
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:24,971
What's this?

552
00:38:27,557 --> 00:38:28,892
It's a Big Gulp.

553
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:40,111
You should say,
"We might see some snow..."

554
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:42,364
"...but it might shift south, miss us."

555
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:45,784
I can say it,
but I sort of wanna understand it.

556
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:47,035
Why is it?

557
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:49,746
Well, it's Canadian trade winds.

558
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:51,831
Behind all of it?

559
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:54,709
Yeah, this will get pushed by wind
out of Canada.

560
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:57,212
So what's it gonna do?
I don't know.

561
00:38:58,546 --> 00:38:59,839
It's a guess.

562
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:03,259
It's wind, man. Blows all over the place.

563
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:07,263
For some reason.

564
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:09,099
I don't know.

565
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,060
I went back to Bolingbrook.

566
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:15,438
I bought a three-month lesson plan.

567
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:17,774
Hang on.
Before you do that, you know...

568
00:39:17,899 --> 00:39:20,443
...let's go out here
and do a little stretching exercises.

569
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:21,528
You got to rotate your...

570
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:23,196
We warm up...

571
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:27,992
...then do basic focus drills,
stuff you never think about.

572
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:30,912
Like closing an eye
without moving your face...

573
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:33,998
...because your face
is the anchor point for your hand...

574
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:36,376
...that allows you to focus.

575
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:43,466
You have to keep your triangle
against a lot of force.

576
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:05,030
We do draws for a half hour,
then releases.

577
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:08,116
That's called "loosing,"
when you release.

578
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:24,883
Great shot! All right!

579
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,803
It's hard...

580
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:30,680
...but that one good shot
leaves you thinking...

581
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:32,766
...you might be catching on.

582
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:35,560
Do you lift weights?

583
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:38,271
What's that?
Do you lift weights?

584
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:39,606
Yeah.

585
00:40:40,648 --> 00:40:43,276
Cardio?
Yeah, you have to do both.

586
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,819
Yeah.

587
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:48,406
Are you on any kind of a program?

588
00:40:48,531 --> 00:40:51,159
Yeah, our gym coach
gave us a program.

589
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,496
That should be good.
Yeah.

590
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:56,456
Yeah.

591
00:40:57,248 --> 00:40:58,500
Fuck.

592
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:00,585
Hey.

593
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:04,047
You know what would be interesting?
What?

594
00:41:04,172 --> 00:41:07,258
We should take some pictures.
Some shots, like...

595
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:09,594
...some now,
some in a month or whatever...

596
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:11,680
...see if you're making gains.

597
00:41:11,846 --> 00:41:12,806
Yeah.

598
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:14,474
I've got my mom's Nikon.

599
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:17,477
Whip your shirt off.
Whip my shirt off?

600
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:19,938
Yeah.

601
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:37,664
You're shredded.

602
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:44,421
This is great, man.

603
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,173
We can compare this shit.

604
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:48,883
That's a Nikon FM?

605
00:41:49,926 --> 00:41:52,971
Well, yeah.
You know something about cameras?

606
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:55,473
Yeah. I took a class at Parker.

607
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:58,435
A couple more.

608
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:03,314
My dad's gonna get the F3 for me...

609
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,067
...if I can finish the program
and maintain a B average.

610
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:09,612
It's like a $600 camera.
I'm psyched about it.

611
00:42:09,946 --> 00:42:11,698
I could loan that to you.

612
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:13,324
Yeah?

613
00:42:13,491 --> 00:42:15,869
I could loan that shit to you if...

614
00:42:16,661 --> 00:42:18,288
...you wanted it earlier.

615
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:20,749
Okay.

616
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:32,052
This is gonna go a lot better.

617
00:42:32,927 --> 00:42:34,137
Why?

618
00:42:34,346 --> 00:42:37,891
Because I got you some bobtail arrows.
They're easier.

619
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:39,434
Why?

620
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:42,020
Well, they're thicker at the ends.

621
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:44,773
See? They taper toward the nock.

622
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:47,275
What's the nock?
The arrow end.

623
00:42:47,984 --> 00:42:51,071
What was I using before?
Chested arrows.

624
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:54,574
That guy didn't know
what he was doing.

625
00:42:59,996 --> 00:43:01,164
Okay.

626
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:02,916
Fletch it.

627
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:05,627
What?
Fix your arrow in.

628
00:43:06,586 --> 00:43:07,962
That's the term.

629
00:43:08,296 --> 00:43:12,258
Arrow makers were called fletchers.
That's where the last name came from.

630
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:14,928
Here. There's a little bit of a...

631
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:19,391
It takes a little while.
Right there, right below the nock.

632
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:22,060
There!

633
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:23,812
Awesome!

634
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:26,940
Okay, let's loose a few.

635
00:43:27,065 --> 00:43:29,025
Let's show our stuff.

636
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:33,446
Aim about a half-foot above.

637
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:35,824
Okay.
You wait till you're steady.

638
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:38,410
Are you aligned?
Yeah.

639
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:40,328
Okay. Let it go.

640
00:43:41,663 --> 00:43:42,747
Fuck!

641
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:44,958
Come on, Shelly. Get your arrow.

642
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,919
We probably didn't home long enough.

643
00:43:48,044 --> 00:43:51,548
That's the pause between drawing back
and firing.

644
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,967
Let's pause a little longer.

645
00:43:57,554 --> 00:43:58,722
What?

646
00:43:59,347 --> 00:44:00,640
Nothing.

647
00:44:01,641 --> 00:44:04,269
Are you just not interested?
Yeah.

648
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:07,814
Yeah, you're not interested?
Or, yeah, you are interested?

649
00:44:07,897 --> 00:44:10,525
Yeah, I'm not. Really.

650
00:44:15,613 --> 00:44:18,491
What was it you liked?
Let's think of it that way.

651
00:44:18,908 --> 00:44:20,076
What?

652
00:44:20,577 --> 00:44:23,872
What interested you
when you thought about archery?

653
00:44:24,581 --> 00:44:26,291
When you wanted to do it.

654
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:30,587
I don't know.
Going hunting or something.

655
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:32,922
Hunting?

656
00:44:33,465 --> 00:44:34,424
Yeah.

657
00:44:36,384 --> 00:44:38,345
For animals?
Yeah.

658
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:42,307
You wanna shoot animals with arrows?

659
00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:44,267
Yeah.
You do?

660
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:46,436
Yeah, to kill them.

661
00:44:47,812 --> 00:44:50,607
But that's not archery. That's hunting.

662
00:44:50,732 --> 00:44:52,901
That's called bowhunting.
That's what you wanted to do?

663
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:55,737
Bowhunting?
Yeah, I saw it on TV.

664
00:44:58,573 --> 00:45:01,451
Well, I don't really wanna kill animals
with arrows...

665
00:45:01,576 --> 00:45:04,079
...so that's not going to happen.
We can target shoot, Shelly.

666
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:06,247
It's not fun.
It's a lot of fun.

667
00:45:06,414 --> 00:45:08,875
You have to apply yourself.
Targets don't move.

668
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,752
Well, you know, Shelly...

669
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,254
...you haven't really hit one yet.

670
00:45:13,338 --> 00:45:14,464
You should support me.

671
00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:17,634
I do support you. I support.

672
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:24,766
All right, forget it. Take your bracer off.

673
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:27,143
We're not shooting anymore.
Okay.

674
00:45:47,163 --> 00:45:50,000
There's a chance
I might be going to New York.

675
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:51,376
A small chance.

676
00:45:52,502 --> 00:45:55,630
You think you'd like to come,
maybe, if I go?

677
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,923
Yeah.

678
00:45:57,048 --> 00:45:59,134
We could maybe go with Poppop.

679
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:01,678
He's got some tests.
Yeah.

680
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:49,684
Hey.

681
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:52,103
Hey, Mike.

682
00:46:52,228 --> 00:46:54,022
You don't look real good, Dad.

683
00:46:54,105 --> 00:46:55,899
Are you okay?
Yeah.

684
00:46:56,566 --> 00:46:59,694
What are you doing out here?
Just sitting here.

685
00:47:00,236 --> 00:47:03,198
Sometimes I just sit here
and look at the house.

686
00:47:04,074 --> 00:47:06,910
You park here sometimes?
Yeah. Sometimes.

687
00:47:07,952 --> 00:47:11,873
I just like to see you guys.
I see you playing guitar up there.

688
00:47:12,832 --> 00:47:14,042
Okay.

689
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:15,960
Sounds good.
Thanks.

690
00:47:18,088 --> 00:47:20,340
You know, Poppop...
Yeah.

691
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:22,717
...he's sick.
Mom said.

692
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:26,304
I was thinking about that, too.

693
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:32,560
Why do you have a bow and arrow
in there?

694
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:36,231
I was just out with Shelly.
I'm not playing favorites.

695
00:47:36,314 --> 00:47:38,775
I just think we need to be together
for a while.

696
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,527
Yeah, that's okay.

697
00:47:41,486 --> 00:47:43,738
How's your program going?
Great.

698
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:54,874
You're gonna get that camera
if you keep it up!

699
00:47:59,754 --> 00:48:01,589
Look at this house.

700
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,384
Someone should be happy here.

701
00:48:05,135 --> 00:48:07,012
How did I fuck this up?

702
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,014
Seriously.

703
00:48:09,848 --> 00:48:13,893
What if I remembered the tartar sauce?
Would things be different?

704
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:17,731
Would Robert die
not thinking I'm a jerk-off...

705
00:48:18,189 --> 00:48:19,399
...jerk-fuck?

706
00:48:19,816 --> 00:48:22,861
Don't forget the tartar sauce.

707
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:23,987
Just call the order in, Noreen...

708
00:48:24,112 --> 00:48:26,614
...and quit busting
my you-know-what, okay?

709
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:29,075
You always half-listen
to what I'm saying to you!

710
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:31,036
I heard you. Tartar sauce.

711
00:48:35,457 --> 00:48:37,917
Tartar sauce. Tartar sauce.
Tartar sauce.

712
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:42,172
Tartar sauce, tartar sauce,
tartar sauce, tartar sauce.

713
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:47,844
Man, how I'd like
to put my face in there.

714
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:50,597
Right in there. Tartar sauce.

715
00:48:52,515 --> 00:48:54,893
My hips are cold. Tartar sauce.

716
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:56,603
That's when you know it's cold.

717
00:48:56,686 --> 00:48:58,480
I like eating pussy. Tartar sauce.

718
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:00,065
A lot of guys don't.
Well, maybe they do.

719
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,650
Maybe that's just black guys.
Tartar sauce.

720
00:49:02,734 --> 00:49:05,195
What happened to the guy
who was trying to go around the world...

721
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,529
...in a balloon? Did he make it?

722
00:49:06,654 --> 00:49:07,906
I should put some espionage...

723
00:49:08,031 --> 00:49:09,908
...or stolen plutonium in my novel.
Tartar sauce.

724
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:12,827
Spice it up. Neil Young. Fuck, it's cold!

725
00:49:13,828 --> 00:49:15,997
Neil Young?
Why am I thinking about Neil Young?

726
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:18,291
Neil Diamond. Neil.
There's not a lot of famous Neils.

727
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:20,043
Is this Wednesday?
I wish I had two dicks.

728
00:49:20,168 --> 00:49:23,129
I thought the whole family was going
to learn Spanish together this year.

729
00:49:23,213 --> 00:49:24,839
That never really happened.

730
00:49:24,964 --> 00:49:27,008
I haven't had a Spanish omelet
in a long time.

731
00:49:28,259 --> 00:49:29,552
Here we go.

732
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:33,348
Anything else?

733
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:35,308
No.

734
00:49:40,397 --> 00:49:42,399
Where is the tartar sauce?

735
00:49:43,566 --> 00:49:46,069
They were out. They apologized.

736
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,489
They were cool about it.
They were out?

737
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:53,702
They were out.
They were out of tartar sauce?

738
00:49:55,161 --> 00:49:56,454
I'm calling them.

739
00:49:57,706 --> 00:49:59,249
Fuck, Noreen.

740
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:03,878
It's not about the tartar sauce.
It's about you. You don't care!

741
00:50:03,962 --> 00:50:05,714
I don't care about tartar sauce!

742
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,424
I'm trying to make a living for this family.

743
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:09,718
I've got work things to think about
and pressure.

744
00:50:09,843 --> 00:50:12,012
Tartar sauce?
Fuck, Noreen, are you serious?

745
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,555
You are so selfish!

746
00:50:16,933 --> 00:50:18,393
I would do anything for you...

747
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:21,938
Everything you say is right.
...as if we're not happy.
