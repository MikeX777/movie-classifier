1
00:01:46,963 --> 00:01:48,823
Come on all you guys. Get to it.

2
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:50,775
Hiya Harry. What kept you?

3
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:53,140
Are you kidding? You know what
you can do with this weather.

4
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,467
What do you care? Next week
you'll be back in the States.

5
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:57,836
You mean it came through?
- Don't ask me. Ask the Captain.

6
00:01:58,256 --> 00:01:59,025
See you.

7
00:01:59,664 --> 00:02:01,496
Good luck .. you lucky stiff.

8
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:04,502
Come on all you guys, get moving.

9
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,391
Harry?

10
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:09,721
Hiya, sweetie.

11
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:11,786
Daddy .. daddy, daddy.

12
00:02:13,463 --> 00:02:15,721
Daddy. Hi, daddy.
- Hiya, Butch.

13
00:02:16,838 --> 00:02:18,082
Say, you're up awful late.

14
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:20,526
Way past your bedtime.

15
00:02:20,863 --> 00:02:22,708
He insisted on waiting
up until you came home.

16
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:23,722
Hi.
- Hi.

17
00:02:23,822 --> 00:02:26,302
Hey Pa, guess what? I shot a bear today.

18
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:28,863
You did?
- And a lion and a tiger.

19
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:30,620
Wow.
- We went to the zoo.

20
00:02:31,864 --> 00:02:32,770
Say, Butch.

21
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,457
How would you like to go somewhere
they've got real lions and bears?

22
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:37,324
Gee, when can we go, Daddy?

23
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:39,006
Oh, in about a couple of weeks.

24
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:41,847
We'll be taking a long airplane trip.

25
00:02:42,102 --> 00:02:43,364
You, me and mum.

26
00:02:43,803 --> 00:02:46,105
You mean we're going to America?
- That's right.

27
00:02:46,777 --> 00:02:50,322
Now be a good boy and go to sleep, and
I'll tell you about it in the morning.

28
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,195
Goodnight, Daddy.
- Night.

29
00:02:54,314 --> 00:02:56,252
Goodnight, Mum.
- Goodnight Tommy.

30
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,237
So your discharge came through?

31
00:03:03,064 --> 00:03:03,708
Yeah.

32
00:03:05,423 --> 00:03:06,982
You don't seem very pleased about it.

33
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:10,602
I'll be very pleased to get
away from this sort of life.

34
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:13,230
Six years of living in married quarters.

35
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:15,846
I've begun to feel as if I'd
joined the army myself.

36
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:17,864
You don't want to go to America do you?

37
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,039
Look, Connie.

38
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,195
I know that we've been
through this before.

39
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:25,800
But I still don't understand why.

40
00:03:26,288 --> 00:03:27,904
The soup will get cold.
- Why, Connie?

41
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,120
I just don't want to go. That's all.

42
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,009
But Connie, everything is all set.
Al's taking me into his business ..

43
00:03:33,226 --> 00:03:33,869
Al ..

44
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,996
I don't believe Al even <i>has</i> a business.

45
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:37,242
Are you kidding?

46
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,018
His father left him one of the largest
canning factories in California.

47
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,372
What's he going to do?
Make you a partner?

48
00:03:43,525 --> 00:03:46,801
I don't understand you, Connie. You were
right here in this room the day Al left.

49
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:49,657
You remember what he said.
- He said a lot of things.

50
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:51,804
He was a big talker all round.
- Alright, alright.

51
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:54,423
So he was a big talker, but he's
always played it straight with me.

52
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,338
What do you have against him?

53
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,387
It's nothing to do with Al. It's just ..
- Just what?

54
00:04:01,765 --> 00:04:03,324
Well Harry, couldn't we wait a while?

55
00:04:04,892 --> 00:04:07,843
All we seem to have done these
past six years is pack and unpack.

56
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:11,219
I've got a home, too.

57
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,480
And a mother that I haven't
seen since we were married.

58
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:19,245
Couldn't spend a few months in
England before we go to America?

59
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:21,392
You mean, in Liverpool?

60
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,930
It's my home, Harry.

61
00:04:25,204 --> 00:04:25,938
Alright.

62
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:27,970
We'll spend a few months in Liverpool.

63
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:30,470
But what do I do for a job?

64
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:33,202
Well, uncle George would
find you something.

65
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:35,276
Uncle George, huh?

66
00:04:37,805 --> 00:04:38,975
Look, Harry.

67
00:04:40,215 --> 00:04:41,547
I love you very much.

68
00:04:43,254 --> 00:04:45,291
I wouldn't want to stand in
your way. You know that.

69
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:48,194
If you would just do this for me.

70
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:52,679
Well, it looks like a ..

71
00:04:53,571 --> 00:04:55,302
I'm going to quit working
for Uncle Sam ..

72
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,431
And start working for uncle George.

73
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:00,175
Thank you.

74
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:01,457
Come here.

75
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,557
Oh no, Harry. The steak. It will burn.

76
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:27,384
Ten pound a week plus meals and
lodging allowance for a 44-hour week.

77
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,098
I should have stayed in the army.

78
00:05:30,198 --> 00:05:32,324
Hey, tighten them ropes.
Do you want to lose that load?

79
00:05:33,411 --> 00:05:34,913
You got to watch them all the time.

80
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,596
Well, there you are.
Take it or leave it.

81
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,235
I don't have much of a choice, do I.

82
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,092
Alright. Come on.

83
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:44,364
This is yours, Miller.

84
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:45,548
How far is Glasgow?

85
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:46,938
Two hundred miles.

86
00:05:47,945 --> 00:05:49,429
That'll take about ten hours, huh?

87
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:51,666
You've been reading them
rules and regulations.

88
00:05:51,954 --> 00:05:55,181
In this game, if you can't make
400 miles a day, you're fired, so ..

89
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:58,502
Climb aboard my boy and let
your uncle Casey lead the way.

90
00:07:18,152 --> 00:07:19,591
Well, hello.
- Hi.

91
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:25,429
A coffee.
- A cup of coffee.

92
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:49,595
Well, we made pretty
good time there, lad.

93
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:50,935
We sure did.

94
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:01,755
There's nothing like a strong cup of
tea for keeping the weather out.

95
00:08:03,474 --> 00:08:04,575
Who are your friends?

96
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:08,643
I never saw them before in my life.

97
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,847
They look kind of sharp.

98
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:13,992
Sharp as razors.

99
00:08:16,085 --> 00:08:17,916
Well .. I guess I'll get going.

100
00:08:19,147 --> 00:08:19,791
Here.

101
00:08:20,387 --> 00:08:22,895
What's your hurry?
We've a long way to go.

102
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:24,937
The way you drive
I'll need a head start.

103
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:27,627
Don't you even have the manners
to wait until I've finished my tea?

104
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,246
See you on the road.

105
00:08:44,321 --> 00:08:44,936
Hey.

106
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:48,534
Hey.

107
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,539
What's the idea? Put that stuff back.

108
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:53,269
You're a bit wet behind the ears
son, aren't you. Go on, beat it.

109
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:15,309
Holy by Jesus.

110
00:09:17,597 --> 00:09:19,519
Saints preserve us.
What are you after doing?

111
00:09:19,789 --> 00:09:21,835
Two guys were trying to
steal things from your truck.

112
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,438
Boy, you've got a lot to
learn about this game.

113
00:09:24,657 --> 00:09:26,674
Look Casey, they were ..
- Do me a favour.

114
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:28,232
Get out of here.
- But Casey ..

115
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:30,387
Come on, come on.
I'll explain later. Come on.

116
00:09:30,568 --> 00:09:31,356
Alright.

117
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,720
Ah, well.

118
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:52,289
Another time, eh?

119
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:12,967
Okay, hold it there.

120
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,788
You made good time. We didn't
expect this load until morning.

121
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:20,052
Where can I get a return
load to Liverpool?

122
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:22,000
You're new around here, aren't you?

123
00:10:22,357 --> 00:10:23,292
That's right.

124
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,313
There's only one man to see.

125
00:10:25,932 --> 00:10:26,690
Joe Easy.

126
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:30,034
There isn't much that moves in and out
of this dock that he doesn't handle.

127
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:33,040
Left at the gate and down the
street there. You cannot miss it.

128
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:35,050
Thanks.

129
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:38,772
Aberdeen. Who's to Aberdeen?

130
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:43,901
Edinburgh. Anyone for Edinburgh?

131
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,192
Yeah. Here.

132
00:10:48,621 --> 00:10:49,951
What's the load?
- Pig iron.

133
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:51,736
How much?
- Fifteen bob a ton.

134
00:10:53,145 --> 00:10:54,049
Well?

135
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:55,543
Alright.
- Name?

136
00:10:55,774 --> 00:10:56,418
Grey.

137
00:10:58,013 --> 00:10:58,599
Ta.

138
00:10:59,424 --> 00:11:00,513
Yes?
- Liverpool.

139
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:02,153
What have you got?
- A ten-tonner.

140
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:03,244
Name?
- Miller.

141
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,240
Alright. Wait a minute, will you.
- Sure.

142
00:11:17,738 --> 00:11:18,982
Where'd you get that mutt?

143
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:21,647
I picked him up on the road.
I guess he must have got lost.

144
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:24,065
What are we going to do with you, eh?

145
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:27,303
I've a little kid at home who would know
what to do with him. Want to sell him?

146
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:28,700
Here, you have him.

147
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,926
Say, thanks.

148
00:11:30,354 --> 00:11:31,627
I'd like to pay you for it.

149
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,387
I'm glad to get rid of him.

150
00:11:35,155 --> 00:11:37,145
Who's for Cardiff?
- Yeah. Me.

151
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,157
Name?
- Jones.

152
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:43,018
Inverness. Anyone for Inverness?

153
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,217
What's the load, mate?
- Fertilizer.

154
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:46,809
Why don't you mail it?

155
00:11:57,146 --> 00:11:59,151
Liverpool. Liverpool anyone?
- Here.

156
00:11:59,715 --> 00:12:01,474
A load of timber for
Liverpool. Any offers?

157
00:12:01,705 --> 00:12:02,714
I'm right here.

158
00:12:02,814 --> 00:12:04,230
I'm going to Liverpool.
- Name?

159
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:05,503
Kenny.

160
00:12:05,603 --> 00:12:07,677
Hey, just a minute. Look,
I've been waiting over here.

161
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:10,015
What's the idea?
- Sorry, chum.

162
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:13,936
That's his load.

163
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:17,179
Let him have it. I'll find out
what's going on around here.

164
00:12:17,407 --> 00:12:19,209
We take it in turns here, son.

165
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,519
Look, either you have the
merchandise or you haven't.

166
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:37,171
If you haven't we can't do business.

167
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:39,174
We would have, Mr Easy.
But we got into trouble.

168
00:12:39,274 --> 00:12:40,413
That's your headache.

169
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:43,117
What do you want?
- Look, I just checked in outside.

170
00:12:43,217 --> 00:12:45,011
Okay, put it somewhere else will you.

171
00:12:45,494 --> 00:12:46,599
Come on, come on.

172
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:48,288
Joe.
- What?

173
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:50,590
Did you okay this contract?

174
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:52,909
That's my signature, isn't it?

175
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:54,058
Look, do you mind?

176
00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:55,516
The man wants to see you, Joe.

177
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:58,441
What is it? What do you want?

178
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,351
I've an empty truck.
I'd like to fill it.

179
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:01,586
Get back on the right.

180
00:13:02,242 --> 00:13:04,574
I've tried there. Your man doesn't
want to do business with me.

181
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:07,110
Well, maybe he doesn't like
your face or something.

182
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,443
Now go on, get out of here.
I've got work to do.

183
00:13:09,543 --> 00:13:11,273
You heard.
- All I want is a job.

184
00:13:11,663 --> 00:13:13,165
Come on, let's go.
- Mind the dog.

185
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:24,588
Get him out of here.

186
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:26,331
Come on, out of it ..

187
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:28,663
You too. Beat it.

188
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:40,347
One thing I wish I could do without
in this business is truck drivers.

189
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:42,737
I seem to remember you
drove a truck once yourself.

190
00:13:42,983 --> 00:13:44,256
Things were different then.

191
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,818
No unions, no nothing.

192
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:47,943
No. It was a real tough game.

193
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:49,554
No rules.

194
00:13:50,358 --> 00:13:51,243
Except this.

195
00:13:51,818 --> 00:13:54,438
And you're still playing by
the old rules, aren't you.

196
00:13:59,912 --> 00:14:02,206
That brother of yours is
beginning to get in my hair.

197
00:14:02,481 --> 00:14:04,564
He's a smart boy, Joe.
- Oh, sure.

198
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,651
He's probably the smartest bookkeeper
whoever came out of jail.

199
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:09,949
We all make mistakes.

200
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,431
I made a mistake the day I took him on.

201
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:15,393
He's still going to go on
working for you, isn't he.

202
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:22,392
Well, are you coming? Because
I'm tired and I want to go home.

203
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:24,187
Look.

204
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:27,228
Why don't you go across the
street and get a cup of coffee?

205
00:14:27,915 --> 00:14:29,105
I'll be five minutes.

206
00:14:30,084 --> 00:14:30,998
Five minutes?

207
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:50,143
Are you badly hurt?

208
00:14:57,244 --> 00:14:58,260
What's the matter?

209
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:00,910
What's happened?

210
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,982
Give me a hand with him, will you.
- Sure, sure.

211
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:04,669
Let's get him inside.

212
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:14,701
Dad, what happened?

213
00:15:14,939 --> 00:15:16,040
I'll get some brandy.

214
00:15:17,021 --> 00:15:18,652
Ben, get me the brandy. Quick.

215
00:15:20,716 --> 00:15:23,301
You shouldn't have gone in there
like that. It was asking for trouble.

216
00:15:24,143 --> 00:15:25,475
I was only asking for a job.

217
00:15:25,715 --> 00:15:28,051
You were asking for a job and
they gave you the business, eh?

218
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:30,305
Here.

219
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:32,104
Thanks.

220
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:38,187
Hey, hey, hey. That ain't beer.

221
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:41,516
Are you going to be alright now?

222
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:42,479
Yeah.

223
00:15:56,126 --> 00:15:56,827
Thanks.

224
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:03,832
Hey .. hey.

225
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:05,591
Say ..

226
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:08,099
How about taking a couple of days off?

227
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:10,521
Take Connie and the kid away
for the weekend somewhere.

228
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:12,335
What's the angle? This isn't Christmas.

229
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,872
I'd like you to make a
run into Glasgow tonight.

230
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:16,946
You got to be kidding.

231
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,175
I've been driving all
day long. I'm bushed.

232
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:20,974
There is a bonus in it if you'll do it.

233
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:22,129
Do what?

234
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,800
There are five hundred crates
of whiskey on that vehicle.

235
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:28,354
That's a new twist.
Taking Scotch into Scotland.

236
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:32,545
You know, I thought that Casey
was on the Glasgow run this week.

237
00:17:32,987 --> 00:17:33,941
That's just it.

238
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,051
I guess I could use a couple of days.

239
00:17:39,396 --> 00:17:40,635
And a bonus.

240
00:17:41,371 --> 00:17:42,615
I can definitely use that.

241
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:44,268
Alright then?
- Okay.

242
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:53,025
Hey .. hey!

243
00:18:04,135 --> 00:18:05,882
As it is, we've missed
the preliminaries.

244
00:18:06,676 --> 00:18:07,554
Hey, Lynn!

245
00:18:09,073 --> 00:18:09,777
Hello?

246
00:18:11,437 --> 00:18:12,053
Yes.

247
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:13,530
Yes, that's right.

248
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,423
Come on, will you?
We'll miss the main bout.

249
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,974
I should break my neck
to see a boxing match.

250
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:19,273
Just a moment.

251
00:18:19,373 --> 00:18:20,005
Joe.

252
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:21,482
It's for you.
- I'm not here.

253
00:18:21,582 --> 00:18:22,825
It's a man called Casey.

254
00:18:24,162 --> 00:18:25,378
He says it's very urgent.

255
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,345
Yep?

256
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,243
Speaking.

257
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:34,525
Yeah.

258
00:18:36,644 --> 00:18:37,831
Well, who is driving it?

259
00:18:39,664 --> 00:18:40,536
You're sorry?

260
00:18:42,438 --> 00:18:43,253
What is it?

261
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:48,198
The whole thing is set up.
Then someone has to get smart.

262
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:50,571
Well, are we working or playing?

263
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,698
Relax, will you.

264
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:01,360
Ed? Joe.

265
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:03,150
It's a new deal.

266
00:19:04,348 --> 00:19:05,824
Yes I know. Now, listen.

267
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:08,965
The truck just left. Get on that road.
Find it. As soon as it stops, ring me.

268
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:12,427
No. I'll handle this one myself.

269
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,729
Hello, Mr Easy.

270
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:37,914
Hiya, Mr Easy.

271
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:45,837
Hello, Mr Easy.

272
00:20:02,198 --> 00:20:03,700
I hear you're an honest man.

273
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:05,832
So?

274
00:20:06,057 --> 00:20:07,645
It's a pleasure to meet an honest man.

275
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:11,837
What's your price?

276
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:17,163
That's quite a load you have out there.

277
00:20:19,373 --> 00:20:20,775
I think we could do a deal.

278
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,412
Look.

279
00:20:31,352 --> 00:20:33,311
Suppose you were to take a walk.

280
00:20:35,094 --> 00:20:36,739
Go out back or have a wash or something.

281
00:20:43,688 --> 00:20:45,335
Hot coffee.
- Coffee.

282
00:20:48,776 --> 00:20:49,706
Ten cigarettes.

283
00:20:50,264 --> 00:20:51,289
Ten cigarettes.

284
00:21:06,372 --> 00:21:08,163
I thought I told you to wait in the car.

285
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,286
I'm getting just a little tired
of waiting for you, Joe.

286
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,382
I'm hungry and I want to
go and eat somewhere.

287
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,914
If you want to eat something,
then eat something.

288
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:18,578
In this pig-house?

289
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,644
Listen. You were serving in a pig-house
like this when I picked you up, baby.

290
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:26,373
Watch out I don't drop you
right back among the pigs.

291
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:30,594
You want to walk back to town, Joe?
Because I'm taking the car.

292
00:21:31,253 --> 00:21:32,469
I wouldn't do that.

293
00:21:41,286 --> 00:21:42,218
Hey, fellahs.

294
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,319
This must be the only café on the
road that has a floor show, huh?

295
00:22:09,164 --> 00:22:10,292
Get him out of there.

296
00:22:10,801 --> 00:22:12,162
Never seen anything like it.

297
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,331
Look, lady. I've got enough
trouble of my own. I don't ..

298
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:26,847
Please, just drive me somewhere.

299
00:22:26,994 --> 00:22:28,897
I can't do it.
- I've got to get away from here.

300
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:29,880
Please.

301
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:33,666
Alright.

302
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:53,618
Here.

303
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,822
Where are we?

304
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:04,198
You hungry?

305
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,265
Are you in love with that guy?

306
00:24:37,203 --> 00:24:38,190
In love with Joe?

307
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,275
Nobody loves Joe .. except maybe Joe.

308
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,640
You were so upset I thought maybe ..

309
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,416
My old man used to get
drunk and knock me around.

310
00:24:51,572 --> 00:24:52,724
Then I hated him.

311
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:56,592
But one day the police
came and took him away.

312
00:24:58,877 --> 00:24:59,785
And I cried.

313
00:25:02,256 --> 00:25:03,095
It's funny.

314
00:25:04,597 --> 00:25:06,829
When you don't have much,
you don't like losing it.

315
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:16,080
It's just Frank I'm worried about.

316
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:17,955
He's my brother.

317
00:25:18,506 --> 00:25:19,305
You see ..

318
00:25:19,772 --> 00:25:22,218
Joe puts up with him on
account of me, but ..

319
00:25:23,214 --> 00:25:25,712
I don't suppose he'd ever get
himself a job anywhere else.

320
00:25:32,085 --> 00:25:33,358
You're married, aren't you?

321
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:35,930
Does it show?

322
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:37,849
I can always tell.

323
00:25:38,989 --> 00:25:40,327
Married men are more ..

324
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:42,597
Simpatico.

325
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:45,910
Well that's Italian. It means sort of ..

326
00:25:46,852 --> 00:25:47,825
Sympathetic?

327
00:25:52,452 --> 00:25:54,191
You know something
else I like about you?

328
00:25:55,445 --> 00:25:57,575
You haven't tried to
make one pass at me.

329
00:25:59,895 --> 00:26:02,339
Usually, when fellow takes a
girl out and buys her a meal ..

330
00:26:02,722 --> 00:26:04,398
He thinks that she's the dessert.

331
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:11,531
Well.

332
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:13,523
Shall we go?

333
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,097
Okay.

334
00:26:18,908 --> 00:26:19,628
Harry.

335
00:26:21,604 --> 00:26:22,350
Thanks.

336
00:26:23,847 --> 00:26:24,629
What for?

337
00:26:26,465 --> 00:26:27,762
Being simpatico.

338
00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:37,604
Thanks.

339
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,095
You look tired, mister.

340
00:26:42,628 --> 00:26:43,777
Been driving long?

341
00:26:44,077 --> 00:26:44,896
All night.

342
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:46,942
We got rooms.

343
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,922
Want to rest up a little?

344
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,681
You and the wife?

345
00:27:26,925 --> 00:27:28,300
You'd better close this up.

346
00:27:28,807 --> 00:27:29,849
You'll catch cold.

347
00:28:30,111 --> 00:28:31,570
Coffee, please.
- Okay.

348
00:29:05,883 --> 00:29:07,585
What's the name of this place?
- Wayside.

349
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:09,833
Give me the police please.

350
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:12,648
Hello? My name is Miller.

351
00:29:13,438 --> 00:29:15,870
I'm at the Wayside café on the A59.

352
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,558
I've just had my truck stolen.

353
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:18,977
Harry. What happened?

354
00:29:20,053 --> 00:29:21,940
What's going on? Was it your truck?

355
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:23,455
Did somebody steal it?

356
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,069
It's quite an act you've put on.

357
00:29:25,461 --> 00:29:27,492
The next time you see
that boyfriend of yours ..

358
00:29:27,592 --> 00:29:29,535
The next time I see him
I'll break both his arms.

359
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:30,858
No, Harry. You're wrong.

360
00:29:31,046 --> 00:29:33,949
Harry, listen to me, please.
I didn't have anything to do with it.

361
00:29:35,266 --> 00:29:35,958
Harry.

362
00:29:47,534 --> 00:29:49,343
What I can't understand Harry is, why?

363
00:29:49,443 --> 00:29:51,388
If you needed cash ..
- You think I was in on it?

364
00:29:51,561 --> 00:29:53,597
Well, what did you stop for?
- Because I was tired.

365
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,519
How about the girl? Was she tired too?

366
00:29:56,485 --> 00:29:57,314
Harry.

367
00:29:57,619 --> 00:29:59,965
You fell for oldest gag on the road.
- Yeah, yeah.

368
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,385
Well.

369
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,338
You're in for a hard time of it now.

370
00:30:03,712 --> 00:30:06,035
Because the insurance companies
won't touch you after this.

371
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:09,524
And I don't think Connie is going
to be very happy about it, either.

372
00:30:12,073 --> 00:30:13,117
Who was she, Harry?

373
00:30:15,712 --> 00:30:17,698
Some girl you picked up on the road?

374
00:30:19,002 --> 00:30:21,491
Suppose we don't talk about it.
- Well I want to talk about it.

375
00:30:21,747 --> 00:30:22,476
I don't.

376
00:30:24,105 --> 00:30:25,482
Well, I hope it was worth it.

377
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:28,850
Well, so now you're out of work.

378
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,398
What are we going to do?

379
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:32,155
I'll tell you what we're going to do.

380
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:34,533
Tomorrow morning, I'm going
down to the steamship company.

381
00:30:34,662 --> 00:30:36,421
I'm going to buy three
tickets for America.

382
00:30:36,772 --> 00:30:38,891
Tonight, I'm writing Al to
tell him we're on our way.

383
00:30:42,938 --> 00:30:43,971
I won't go, Harry.

384
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,116
What do you want me to do, Connie?

385
00:30:46,216 --> 00:30:48,259
Stay here and scratch around
trying to make a living?

386
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:50,318
When I've got a good job
waiting for me back home.

387
00:30:50,956 --> 00:30:51,986
I'm not going.

388
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,669
Alright.

389
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,403
You go to America.

390
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:02,520
But you'll go without me.

391
00:31:24,034 --> 00:31:24,849
Easy, easy.

392
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:27,467
Easy, Connie.

393
00:31:33,923 --> 00:31:34,967
I'm with you, baby.

394
00:31:36,854 --> 00:31:38,229
We'll figure something out.

395
00:31:52,849 --> 00:31:53,479
Joe.

396
00:31:56,669 --> 00:31:57,313
Well?

397
00:31:58,735 --> 00:32:00,168
We couldn't find her, Mr Easy.

398
00:32:02,466 --> 00:32:04,373
We went back to the
café but she had gone.

399
00:32:05,514 --> 00:32:06,329
Gone where?

400
00:32:09,143 --> 00:32:10,731
Did she go off with that truck driver?

401
00:32:12,752 --> 00:32:14,025
Well did she or didn't she?

402
00:32:15,571 --> 00:32:16,806
I don't know, Mr Easy.

403
00:32:35,316 --> 00:32:36,246
A truck driver.

404
00:32:38,072 --> 00:32:39,002
A truck driver.

405
00:32:43,124 --> 00:32:43,796
Frank.

406
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:46,874
Yes, Joe?

407
00:32:47,414 --> 00:32:50,089
I want you to go out and find that
sister of yours and bring her back here.

408
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,255
How?

409
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:54,481
In chains?

410
00:32:55,132 --> 00:32:56,118
I don't care how.

411
00:32:57,745 --> 00:32:59,463
I just want her back here. That's all.

412
00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:15,430
A cup of tea, Joe.
- Right.

413
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,330
Oh, it's real cold. Real cold.

414
00:33:23,063 --> 00:33:25,507
Cold enough to freeze the
head off a brass monkey.

415
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,474
Well, how you been?

416
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,835
Not so good, I hear.
Ah, that's bad, bad.

417
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:35,914
Nothing is so degrading for a
man as to be looking for work.

418
00:33:37,063 --> 00:33:37,821
Oh and ..

419
00:33:38,332 --> 00:33:40,282
There is something I wanted
to talk to you about.

420
00:33:40,382 --> 00:33:41,368
Care for a drink?

421
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:45,499
I've a little job on hand.

422
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:48,427
I need someone to drive a truck.

423
00:33:48,957 --> 00:33:50,225
Someone reliable.

424
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:52,055
Like yourself for instance.

425
00:33:53,452 --> 00:33:54,267
There is ..

426
00:33:56,677 --> 00:33:58,678
There's two hundred
pounds in it for you.

427
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,189
It sounds pretty crooked.

428
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:05,480
Crooked? Well a little ..

429
00:34:05,803 --> 00:34:07,207
Bent maybe.

430
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:10,256
I'll see you later, Casey.
- What's the matter?

431
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,396
You and the family given up eating?

432
00:34:14,551 --> 00:34:16,713
Don't worry about me and
the family. I'll get a job.

433
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:17,837
Doing what?

434
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:19,812
You're on the list, Harry.

435
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,484
Once you're on the list, you're dead.

436
00:34:25,218 --> 00:34:26,569
Sorry chum, can't use you.

437
00:35:12,394 --> 00:35:14,587
Alright. Back it onto
the other truck. Come on.

438
00:35:15,515 --> 00:35:16,244
Come on.

439
00:35:34,611 --> 00:35:35,597
Hiya, Harry boy.

440
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:36,743
Hi, Casey.

441
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:39,002
Looks like one of Joe Easy's trucks.

442
00:35:39,523 --> 00:35:40,432
You don't say.

443
00:35:41,482 --> 00:35:43,442
Are things getting so tough
he has to rob himself?

444
00:35:43,772 --> 00:35:45,068
Okay Tom, let's have you.

445
00:35:45,448 --> 00:35:46,134
Right.

446
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:52,028
Looks like they ran out of gas.

447
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:56,732
Nothing like a nice
fire on a cold night.

448
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:08,227
Alright Casey, let's go.

449
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,134
Be seeing you, boy.

450
00:36:13,842 --> 00:36:15,374
Get her up to the hedge.
- Right.

451
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:16,546
Okay. That's enough.

452
00:36:36,244 --> 00:36:37,905
Alright, Casey?
- Okay.

453
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:42,923
Alright. Let her go!

454
00:37:06,337 --> 00:37:07,820
Come on, let's get out of here.

455
00:37:09,784 --> 00:37:11,004
Well come on, come on.

456
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:28,658
I can't understand it.

457
00:37:29,746 --> 00:37:31,477
I know that road like
the back of my hand.

458
00:37:32,398 --> 00:37:33,660
There is nothing to it.

459
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,938
Unless something went
wrong with the steering.

460
00:37:37,012 --> 00:37:38,798
We didn't find any skid-marks.

461
00:37:40,334 --> 00:37:42,913
Still, we'll be able to have
a proper look in the morning.

462
00:37:44,924 --> 00:37:45,568
Yeah.

463
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:51,377
Well?

464
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,839
You will be required to give evidence
at the inquest of course, Mr Easy.

465
00:38:04,334 --> 00:38:05,779
Yes. Yeah, of course.

466
00:38:13,178 --> 00:38:14,188
What do you want?

467
00:38:21,713 --> 00:38:22,557
What's this?

468
00:38:23,463 --> 00:38:24,622
What does it look like?

469
00:38:29,263 --> 00:38:30,193
It's all burnt.

470
00:38:31,664 --> 00:38:32,579
So is Casey.

471
00:38:36,579 --> 00:38:37,198
Now.

472
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:39,001
Give me my money.

473
00:38:48,476 --> 00:38:49,749
It was too bad about Casey.

474
00:38:52,212 --> 00:38:53,438
Getting killed like that.

475
00:38:55,689 --> 00:38:57,105
It's not going to work out, Joe.

476
00:38:59,732 --> 00:39:02,035
The police aren't stupid and
neither is the insurance company.

477
00:39:02,229 --> 00:39:03,540
Why don't you wrap it up?

478
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,302
You must have really needed that money.

479
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,653
What's the matter?
Can't you afford her anymore?

480
00:39:31,794 --> 00:39:33,181
Is she buying too many dresses?

481
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,746
Going to too many clubs?

482
00:39:36,857 --> 00:39:38,986
Just a little too rich
for your blood, huh?

483
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:40,828
What are you talking about?

484
00:39:40,928 --> 00:39:43,002
I'm talking about Lynn.
That's what I'm talking about.

485
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:45,893
What's the matter with you, Easy?

486
00:39:47,288 --> 00:39:48,447
Did you lose something?

487
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:51,528
I don't know where Lynn is.

488
00:39:54,991 --> 00:39:55,915
I thought ..

489
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,229
Well you thought wrong.

490
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,778
Hey.

491
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,537
Lynn wants to see you.

492
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,004
She's in Liverpool.

493
00:40:18,465 --> 00:40:20,458
She's working in a club
called The Congo. Only ..

494
00:40:20,683 --> 00:40:21,974
Don't tell him I told you.

495
00:40:22,147 --> 00:40:22,962
Hey, Frank.

496
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:24,912
Come in here, will you.

497
00:41:07,238 --> 00:41:09,964
You're cool, baby. Real cool.
- Take it easy.

498
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:11,914
Come on, let's dance.

499
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:14,826
Come on, let's dance.
- I'm not dancing right now.

500
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,149
Why, what's the matter?

501
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,901
That's what you're here for.
It's what they pay you for, isn't it?

502
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:19,870
Come on.

503
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,301
The lady is dancing with me.

504
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:45,075
I owe you an apology.

505
00:41:48,399 --> 00:41:49,701
I thought that ..
- I know.

506
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:13,041
Are you trying to tell me I
deliberately over-insured a vehicle ..

507
00:42:13,216 --> 00:42:15,187
Had it pushed off the road
then killed the driver?

508
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:16,558
Is that what you mean?

509
00:42:16,658 --> 00:42:18,967
Well I wouldn't put it exactly
in those words, Mr Easy.

510
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:20,830
Then how would you put it?

511
00:42:21,264 --> 00:42:22,090
Mr Easy.

512
00:42:22,578 --> 00:42:25,830
All I know is that the insurance company
isn't very happy about this accident.

513
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:28,860
And they've asked me to investigate
the matter and to make out my report.

514
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,463
Then you'd better get out of here
and make your report, hadn't you.

515
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:33,153
Very well.

516
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,615
That shipment of furs just come in, Joe.

517
00:42:37,862 --> 00:42:38,506
Okay.

518
00:42:39,027 --> 00:42:40,742
Shall I put an extra
watchman on tonight?

519
00:42:40,842 --> 00:42:41,769
Yeah, sure.

520
00:42:44,376 --> 00:42:45,217
Good day.

521
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:49,808
Next time you come, let me know.

522
00:42:50,252 --> 00:42:51,357
I've a lawyer here.

523
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,008
I think that would be
advisable, Mr Easy.

524
00:43:06,149 --> 00:43:09,142
Now we've the police <i>and</i> the insurance
company breathing down our necks.

525
00:43:10,044 --> 00:43:11,470
And this came this morning.

526
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,349
What's that?
- A final demand from National Oil.

527
00:43:14,854 --> 00:43:15,927
Eight thousand quid.

528
00:43:19,755 --> 00:43:20,513
Hey, hey!

529
00:43:20,696 --> 00:43:22,982
Those are sable pelts you're
handling, not bananas.

530
00:43:24,243 --> 00:43:25,573
What are we going to do, Joe?

531
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,499
What do you mean 'we'?
You only work here, remember.

532
00:43:34,827 --> 00:43:35,642
Now look ..

533
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:37,459
I'm the company secretary.

534
00:43:38,004 --> 00:43:39,849
I'm just as eligible to
go to jail as you are.

535
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,232
I've been inside before
and I didn't like it.

536
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:44,291
"<i>Yes, sir?</i>"

537
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:46,179
Get me Coastal Steamship
Company, Liverpool.

538
00:43:49,616 --> 00:43:51,175
You know the trouble with you, Frank?

539
00:43:51,416 --> 00:43:52,746
You're in the wrong business.

540
00:43:52,903 --> 00:43:55,847
With your stomach you should be selling
ladies' underwear or something.

541
00:43:57,659 --> 00:43:58,446
[ Buzzer ]

542
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:01,298
Hello. Is McNaughton in?

543
00:44:02,785 --> 00:44:03,829
Yeah, I'll hold on.

544
00:44:05,651 --> 00:44:06,513
"<i>Yes, Joe?</i>"

545
00:44:06,749 --> 00:44:07,971
Sam, that American.

546
00:44:08,207 --> 00:44:10,404
What's-his-name? Miller?
Know where I can get hold of him?

547
00:44:10,862 --> 00:44:13,500
"<i>I've got no address here, Joe.
All I know is he lives in Liverpool</i>."

548
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,977
Never mind. I'll find him.

549
00:44:18,863 --> 00:44:20,279
Haven't you got some work to do?

550
00:44:23,736 --> 00:44:24,817
Mack? Joe Easy.

551
00:44:25,887 --> 00:44:26,531
Fine.

552
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:30,037
Say, look. I'm coming down to Liverpool
this afternoon. I want to talk to you.

553
00:44:50,953 --> 00:44:52,448
You're a hard man to find, Miller.

554
00:44:53,338 --> 00:44:54,813
Now that you've found me, so what?

555
00:44:57,087 --> 00:44:58,217
I want to talk to you.

556
00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:00,321
I don't want to talk to you.

557
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,077
I think you will.

558
00:45:21,297 --> 00:45:22,255
I've had enough.

559
00:45:31,941 --> 00:45:32,585
Well?

560
00:45:34,542 --> 00:45:36,330
A proposition that will
make your hair curl.

561
00:45:38,715 --> 00:45:39,570
What is it?

562
00:45:56,692 --> 00:45:58,129
Well .. yes or no?

563
00:46:00,526 --> 00:46:01,112
No.

564
00:46:07,554 --> 00:46:10,273
You've just said no to a
lot of money my friend.

565
00:46:10,442 --> 00:46:12,030
I don't think you'll get away with it.

566
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,315
Those skins will be
so hot they'll sweat.

567
00:46:15,133 --> 00:46:16,377
You'll be stuck with them.

568
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,187
In this country, maybe.

569
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:22,451
I'm told I can get a very good
price for them in America.

570
00:46:27,078 --> 00:46:28,352
I used to have a friend.

571
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:31,123
Runs a small cargo boat
between here and Boston.

572
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:36,179
Plenty of room on board if
you'd like to come along.

573
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:42,524
I wouldn't advise staying in this
country after doing a job like this.

574
00:46:49,758 --> 00:46:50,444
Well?

575
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:53,341
You should change your mind.

576
00:47:46,537 --> 00:47:47,445
Get in, Frank.

577
00:48:01,726 --> 00:48:03,788
I've just seen Frank.
He says Joe is looking for you.

578
00:48:04,413 --> 00:48:05,154
I know.

579
00:48:05,394 --> 00:48:06,357
He was just in.

580
00:48:08,494 --> 00:48:10,482
You're not going to get mixed
up with him, are you?

581
00:48:10,755 --> 00:48:12,915
Frank says the police are on to him.
- What do you think?

582
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:23,337
Honey, what is the matter?

583
00:48:23,787 --> 00:48:24,516
Nothing.

584
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:28,183
You were going to ring me
last night. What happened?

585
00:48:28,378 --> 00:48:29,239
Look, I ..

586
00:48:29,589 --> 00:48:30,703
I had things to do.

587
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:32,878
I'll see you around.

588
00:48:35,391 --> 00:48:36,149
But when?

589
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,531
Look baby, I ..

590
00:48:40,099 --> 00:48:41,518
What about this afternoon?

591
00:48:42,134 --> 00:48:44,427
We could meet in the park or something.

592
00:48:46,243 --> 00:48:47,270
Please, Harry.

593
00:48:50,935 --> 00:48:51,618
Okay.

594
00:48:52,434 --> 00:48:53,398
About four?

595
00:49:08,459 --> 00:49:10,214
Butch .. keep it down to a roar.

596
00:49:10,544 --> 00:49:11,889
It's got engine trouble.

597
00:49:12,193 --> 00:49:14,529
Take it to the garage.
Take the dog with you too.

598
00:49:14,957 --> 00:49:17,100
Go and play in the war, Johnny. Go on.

599
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:26,949
I'm going out for some cigarettes.

600
00:49:27,049 --> 00:49:29,162
Why not take Johnny with you?
He's not been out today.

601
00:49:29,262 --> 00:49:30,163
It's raining.

602
00:49:31,204 --> 00:49:32,849
He will be alright if he wears his coat.

603
00:49:36,669 --> 00:49:37,965
Come on, Johnny. Going out.

604
00:49:44,667 --> 00:49:46,164
All set, Daddy. Let's go.

605
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:55,685
Let's go, Butch.

606
00:49:57,448 --> 00:49:58,185
Harry.

607
00:50:01,857 --> 00:50:02,649
Take care.

608
00:50:35,351 --> 00:50:37,289
Butch, play on the swings.
I'll be just a minute.

609
00:50:37,389 --> 00:50:38,186
Okay.

610
00:50:46,405 --> 00:50:47,679
You are 'Butch' aren't you?

611
00:50:47,972 --> 00:50:49,511
Yeah .. how do you know?

612
00:50:52,002 --> 00:50:54,003
Is that a dog? I got a dog.

613
00:50:56,517 --> 00:50:57,717
Would you like this one?

614
00:50:58,002 --> 00:50:59,361
Gee, thanks.

615
00:51:00,293 --> 00:51:01,232
There you are.

616
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:02,862
Thank you.

617
00:51:28,035 --> 00:51:29,786
Alright, Harry. Let's have it.

618
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:33,102
This is it, isn't it.

619
00:51:37,082 --> 00:51:37,727
Why?

620
00:51:39,292 --> 00:51:41,317
It was alright. It was going along fine.

621
00:51:42,619 --> 00:51:44,396
I didn't try and move in on you.

622
00:51:47,836 --> 00:51:49,842
All I asked was just
a little bit of your life.

623
00:51:50,084 --> 00:51:51,427
Is that too much to ask?

624
00:51:52,885 --> 00:51:53,965
I've tried.

625
00:51:55,043 --> 00:51:56,382
It .. it won't work.

626
00:51:56,815 --> 00:51:58,568
It .. just won't work.

627
00:52:00,782 --> 00:52:02,765
But you're still in love
with me, aren't you?

628
00:52:10,112 --> 00:52:11,099
Well, aren't you?

629
00:52:12,494 --> 00:52:13,366
I don't know.

630
00:52:14,814 --> 00:52:17,250
All I know is I have a wife and
a kid and they both need me.

631
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:20,407
I need you, Harry.

632
00:52:21,365 --> 00:52:22,237
Not that way.

633
00:52:34,888 --> 00:52:35,904
You can't do this.

634
00:52:39,541 --> 00:52:40,683
You cannot turn me ..

635
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,981
Inside out and just leave me.

636
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,112
Harry.

637
00:52:48,107 --> 00:52:49,083
Do you hear me?

638
00:52:50,695 --> 00:52:52,125
You can't do this to me.

639
00:53:02,572 --> 00:53:03,942
Are you hurt, Butch? Huh?

640
00:53:04,573 --> 00:53:05,692
Any bones broken.

641
00:53:06,815 --> 00:53:08,725
Ah, you'll be alright.
Come on, we'll go home.

642
00:53:11,516 --> 00:53:12,431
Is he hurt?

643
00:53:12,957 --> 00:53:13,829
He's alright.

644
00:53:15,127 --> 00:53:16,028
Goodbye, Lynn.

645
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:07,157
Lynn, I ..

646
00:54:08,048 --> 00:54:09,047
I'm sorry. I ..

647
00:54:16,477 --> 00:54:18,992
How do you feel, Butch?
- I didn't cry, did I Daddy.

648
00:54:19,597 --> 00:54:20,641
No you didn't, son.

649
00:54:24,241 --> 00:54:24,913
There.

650
00:54:25,466 --> 00:54:26,796
Now you go and get undressed.

651
00:54:27,683 --> 00:54:28,641
Are you alright?

652
00:54:28,764 --> 00:54:29,923
Do you still feel sick?

653
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:31,919
Go on then.

654
00:54:38,685 --> 00:54:39,894
The police were here.

655
00:54:42,049 --> 00:54:43,093
What did they want?

656
00:54:43,615 --> 00:54:44,825
They wanted to see you.

657
00:54:45,632 --> 00:54:47,628
Something to do with
an accident with a truck.

658
00:54:51,756 --> 00:54:52,915
What's going on, Harry?

659
00:54:54,004 --> 00:54:55,391
You've been like this for days.

660
00:54:55,889 --> 00:54:58,604
You hardly talk to me. You come and go.
You don't tell me where you've been.

661
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:00,526
I thought a man was coming to fix this.

662
00:55:00,976 --> 00:55:03,057
You don't live here, Harry.
You're just lodging.

663
00:55:04,201 --> 00:55:05,302
Hey, look what I got.

664
00:55:08,436 --> 00:55:09,337
That's nice.

665
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,011
Where did you get that.
- The lady gave it to me.

666
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:13,685
Lady? What lady?

667
00:55:13,933 --> 00:55:15,034
The lady in the park.

668
00:55:15,382 --> 00:55:16,328
She was crying.

669
00:55:16,948 --> 00:55:18,404
Why was she crying, Daddy?

670
00:55:19,228 --> 00:55:20,615
You'd better go to bed, Butch.

671
00:55:20,715 --> 00:55:22,157
But I ..
- Go to bed, Butch.

672
00:55:24,382 --> 00:55:25,283
Go on, Johnny.

673
00:55:27,186 --> 00:55:27,887
Yes.

674
00:55:29,285 --> 00:55:30,672
I'll come up and see you later.

675
00:55:31,285 --> 00:55:32,772
Okay .. night, Mom.

676
00:55:33,061 --> 00:55:33,870
Goodnight.

677
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,445
Night, Daddy.
- Night.

678
00:55:40,868 --> 00:55:43,514
Do you have to take the boy with you
when you go to meet your girlfriends?

679
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,194
Who was it this time?

680
00:55:48,948 --> 00:55:50,221
Someone else you picked up?

681
00:55:51,302 --> 00:55:54,025
Don't tell me it's the same one?
How romantic.

682
00:55:57,057 --> 00:55:58,273
Are you in love with her?

683
00:56:00,431 --> 00:56:01,303
Look, Connie.

684
00:56:02,023 --> 00:56:02,955
It's over with.

685
00:56:03,367 --> 00:56:04,621
It's finished.
- Are you?

686
00:56:09,392 --> 00:56:10,964
Then why the big sacrifice, Harry?

687
00:56:11,143 --> 00:56:13,294
Why so noble?
- I don't want to break up our marriage.

688
00:56:13,487 --> 00:56:16,406
You're not trying to hold it together.
- You've done nothing to help either.

689
00:56:16,609 --> 00:56:19,854
One thing you did to me no woman should
ever do to a man. You stood in my way.

690
00:56:20,466 --> 00:56:23,267
You knew I didn't want to stay here. The
minute I gave into you, what happened?

691
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:26,333
Everything went wrong. Everything.

692
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,017
Alright.

693
00:56:32,246 --> 00:56:34,721
If that's the way you want it, I won't
stand in your way any longer.

694
00:56:35,991 --> 00:56:37,323
Go to America if you want to.

695
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,184
And take her with you.
- I'm staying right here.

696
00:56:40,284 --> 00:56:41,757
I don't know that I want you here.

697
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:44,206
You're forgetting we have a kid.

698
00:56:44,439 --> 00:56:46,885
We can manage without you.
- You're not going to manage without me.

699
00:56:47,735 --> 00:56:49,008
He needs a home doesn't he?

700
00:56:49,585 --> 00:56:51,588
He's as much my kid
as he is yours, isn't he?

701
00:56:51,688 --> 00:56:52,424
Is he?

702
00:56:52,837 --> 00:56:53,709
Is he, Harry?

703
00:57:00,641 --> 00:57:01,881
What do you mean by that?

704
00:57:07,713 --> 00:57:08,843
Honey, I'm asking you.

705
00:57:10,744 --> 00:57:11,988
What did you mean by that?

706
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:16,169
I'm asking you a question, Connie.

707
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,537
Answer me.

708
00:57:23,203 --> 00:57:24,695
He is ours, isn't he Connie?

709
00:57:25,072 --> 00:57:26,660

01:21:29,066 --> 01:21:30,997
But Harry, they're bound
to be looking for you.

891
01:21:31,097 --> 01:21:32,719
They may even be watching the house.

892
01:21:34,795 --> 01:21:35,740
Please, Harry.

893
01:21:38,405 --> 01:21:39,587
Alright. Here.

894
01:22:21,931 --> 01:22:23,043
Is it Mrs Miller?

895
01:22:24,032 --> 01:22:24,792
Yes.

896
01:22:27,653 --> 01:22:28,983
Could I come in for a moment?

897
01:22:39,883 --> 01:22:40,870
What do you want?

898
01:22:44,816 --> 01:22:47,105
Harry asked me to give you this.

899
01:22:55,264 --> 01:22:56,203
Are you the ..?

900
01:22:59,199 --> 01:23:00,011
Yes.

901
01:23:10,892 --> 01:23:11,938
Mrs Miller?

902
01:23:12,574 --> 01:23:13,441
Yes, doctor.

903
01:23:13,945 --> 01:23:15,432
I shall have to call an ambulance.

904
01:23:15,865 --> 01:23:16,896
An ambulance?

905
01:23:17,385 --> 01:23:19,305
Why, what's wrong?
What's the matter with him?

906
01:23:19,405 --> 01:23:21,193
The boy has a brain
haemorrhage, Mrs Miller.

907
01:23:22,152 --> 01:23:24,198
He must have banged his head
rather severely somehow.

908
01:23:25,049 --> 01:23:27,266
I see he has got rather a bad bruise.
How did that happen?

909
01:23:29,308 --> 01:23:30,607
The other day, he ..

910
01:23:31,165 --> 01:23:32,424
He .. fell ..

911
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:35,603
Well, we must get him to
hospital straight away.

912
01:23:35,926 --> 01:23:36,713
Excuse me.

913
01:24:12,873 --> 01:24:14,198
Western docks.

914
01:24:16,373 --> 01:24:17,959
What's the matter?
- Nothing.

915
01:24:18,059 --> 01:24:19,417
Everything go alright?
- Hmm.

916
01:24:20,265 --> 01:24:21,374
How did she take it?

917
01:24:21,733 --> 01:24:22,580
She took it.

918
01:24:22,778 --> 01:24:24,299
The kid .. did you see him?

919
01:24:27,017 --> 01:24:27,918
Well, did you?

920
01:24:28,503 --> 01:24:30,393
Driver, could you go quicker.
We're in a hurry.

921
01:24:31,422 --> 01:24:33,267
Lynn, is .. is there something
wrong with him?

922
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:36,378
Lynn, I'm asking you. Is there?

923
01:24:37,158 --> 01:24:38,007
Harry.

924
01:24:42,114 --> 01:24:43,501
They're taking him to hospital.

925
01:24:44,814 --> 01:24:45,733
Hospital?

926
01:24:48,215 --> 01:24:48,830
Why?

927
01:24:49,414 --> 01:24:52,379
I don't know. The doctor said
something about banging his head.

928
01:24:53,957 --> 01:24:55,373
Driver, turn around and go back.

929
01:24:55,473 --> 01:24:57,719
Harry, are you crazy?
The police are watching the house.

930
01:24:57,819 --> 01:24:58,891
Please listen to me.

931
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:01,844
Turn around and go back, driver.
- Harry, don't you understand?

932
01:25:01,944 --> 01:25:04,359
In a couple of days we'll be a
hundred miles away from here.

933
01:25:05,369 --> 01:25:06,395
I love you.

934
01:25:07,255 --> 01:25:10,518
I love you like I never loved
anybody before in my whole life.

935
01:25:12,067 --> 01:25:15,288
I couldn't bear it if you took
it away from me again.

936
01:25:15,614 --> 01:25:16,586
Please, Harry.

937
01:25:17,784 --> 01:25:18,485
Please.

938
01:25:22,035 --> 01:25:23,279
What do you want me to do?

939
01:25:37,141 --> 01:25:37,870
Go back.

940
01:26:11,279 --> 01:26:11,951
Butch?

941
01:26:15,273 --> 01:26:15,945
Butch.

942
01:26:17,322 --> 01:26:18,366
Are you his father?

943
01:26:27,082 --> 01:26:27,697
Yes.

944
01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:29,860
I'm his father.

945
01:26:31,394 --> 01:26:32,438
Will he be alright?

946
01:26:33,343 --> 01:26:34,816
Don't worry. We'll look after him.

947
01:27:04,985 --> 01:27:06,601
Are you coming in the ambulance, madam?

948
01:27:08,364 --> 01:27:09,179
Yes, I'm ..

949
01:27:36,677 --> 01:27:37,958
Back to the docks, Miss?

950
01:27:41,831 --> 01:27:43,172
Do you know the Congo Club?

951
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,023
Yes, Miss.

952
01:27:47,802 --> 01:27:48,846
Just take me there.

953
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:15,774
..s-d..
