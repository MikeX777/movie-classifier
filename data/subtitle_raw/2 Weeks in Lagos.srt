-Yea?
-Oh that's right, Charlie.

69
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,000
Your mother is a perfect cook.

70
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,720
You know she gets the basic ingredients,
and then creates magic

71
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,200
Haha, that's how I created this.

72

78
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,640
Now, you're squeezing the life out of me!

79
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,120
[Lollipop] Sorry.

80
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,000
So, okay, meet my friend, Keme.
My sister, Lola.

81
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,400
-Hey.

Alright.

88
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,120
At least we can use this as

-[mum clears throat].
-[Teni] D'you want some juice?

90
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,360
[Charlie] This smells fantastic

91
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,760
No, no, no, no, just serve them.
They are the visitors [laughs]

92
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,880
Ohh, well, I'll serve my son.

93
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,240
Awww, mom.

94
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,280
-[Charlie] Thank you Mama.
-You're welcome.

95
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,440
And me.

96
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,120
Please don't forget me.

97
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,400

-[plates clinking]

99
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,120
So how are the wedding plans going?

100
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,840
-[Teni] So far, so good
-[Joshua] Yeah

101
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,839
Okay. Yes, That’s fine.

102
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,800
That’s fine, thank you so much.

103
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,320
Yea, alright. God bless. Bye.

104
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,120
-Hey, easy.
-Oh sorry. Hi

105
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,000
Hi, I wasn't expecting to
bump into anyone.

106
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,720
-Are you leaving?
-No no.

107
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,600
Not at all. I was wondering what
was keeping you out here.

108
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,760
So I came to check on you.
Make sure you were safe.

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Alright, just kidding.
I wanted to stretch my legs

110
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,680
and I noticed you hadn’t
had some of the famous pie

111
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,280
and no drink either,
so I brought you some.

112
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,560
You do know stale
food can make you sick, right?

113
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,680
Okay, thanks for the nutrition lesson.
Are you a doctor?

114
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,120
No, not even,
just a concerned friend, I guess.

115
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,160
Right.

116
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,400
You gonna take it or what?

117
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,120
Oh yes, yes, sorry.

118
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,920
-Thanks. Yes.
-Yea?

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,960
-No pie?
-I had to…

120
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,280
-No [chuckles]
-Okay.

121
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,120
I had to step out to make a phone call.

122
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,280
The call must have been important.

123
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,280
-Yes it was.
-Was it business?

124
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,120
Do you usually ask these
many questions of people you just met?

125
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,240
The thing is, Charlie talks about you,
like, all the time.

126
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,600
So, in my mind, we're already friends.

127
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,400
Friends. [smacks lips]
There’s that word again.

128
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,600
Do you have a problem being friends?

129
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,880
-No comment.
-No... [sighs]

130
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,840
Spoken like a true lawyer.

131
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,760
Oh, wow. Okay, fine,
Charlie has really spoken about me a lot.

132
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,800
What about you? What do you do?

133
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,320
Err, this and that…

134
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,480
Alright, I'm an investment banker.
[inhales]

135
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,200
-I work on Wall Street.
-Wow.

136
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,400
You know I was thinking you were like...

137
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,720
-an actor or model or something like that.
-[chuckles]

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Sorry, I didn't mean to laugh,

139
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,000
but you think i could pass for an actor?

140
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,320
What is it? My eyebrows,
or my perfect leading man looks?

141
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,440
Which one?

142
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,720
[sighs] Uhmm..

143
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,680
I’m gonna go back inside, okay?

144
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,680
[sucks teeth] Sure.

145
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,200
I’m hoping you're gonna get
to stay home a lot longer this time.

146
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,400
I hope so too.

147
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,400
-Hi, Lollipop.
-Oh, there you are. [clears throat]

148
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,720
I was beginning to
wonder where you guys went to.

149
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,520
-I needed to use my phone, to call, just--
-[Keme coughs]

150
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,240
[exhales]

151
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,440
[Keme] Right.

152
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,320
[mum chuckles]

153
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,680
[Charlie] Everything okay?

154
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,280
[lighthearted music]

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,760
Ejike! [door closes] How are you doing?

156
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,800
Mum, can you try knocking once in a while?

157
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,360
It's that thing that p…

158
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,680
[sucks teeth]

159
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,000
Come in mum, good morning.

160
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,840
make yourself comfortable.

161
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,640
[sniffs]

162
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,040
Did you sleep well?

163
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,560
I did, actually.

164
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,880
[sniffs] How was your night?

165
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,200
We thank God.

166
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,960
Your father called this morning,

167
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,600
but it was too early,
so didn't want to wake you up.

168
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,560
He was expecting your call last night.

169
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,800
Right, I actually meant to call him.

170
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,520
Sorry, I got in really late
last night and I was really tired.

171
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,640
-I'm going to Abuja.
-Okay.

172
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,120
You’re home,

173
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,160
I want you to come with me.

174
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,120
I will be fine

175
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,360
And besides, Charlie and I actually
have a couple of meetings here, so

176
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,360
next weekend.

177
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:46,120
And when are we going to get to meet
this your mysterious friend?

178
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,400
You'll meet him soon.

179
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,480
We're just a little
busy right now, that's all.

180
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,720
Hmm

181
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,920
Okay, so it's more
important to have these meetings

182
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,120
with your mysterious
friends than go and visit your father?

183
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,960
I did not say that, alright?

184
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,400
Okay, so when you finish
with your meetings, come to Abuja.

185
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,680
Okay. What's going on?

186
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,080
Come on tell me, why are
you so intent on me coming to Abuja,

187
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,000
What's happening?

188
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Is it a bad thing to
go and visit your father?

189
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,800
No of course not.

190
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,640
But you literally just said,
he's busy doing his political stuff.

191
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,480
So why do i need to be there so badly?

192
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,000
-Okay.
-Okay.

193
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,920
Stay for your meetings.

194
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,520
I mean... [laughs]
You never listen to what I say.

195
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,159
Here we go.

196
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,679
I really don't know why I bother!

197
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,960
Okay, look. Mum, mum, mum!

198
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,080
Where are you going? Goodness.

199
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,960
Okay.

200
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,080
Okay, look, let's do this.

201
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,880
We will spend this weekend together

202
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,960
We will do some fun stuff
then you can go to Abuja on Sunday.

203
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,480
And when I'm done with
my meetings here, I...

204
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,480
I will come join you.

205
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,560
That's a good idea.

206
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,320
Oh, and I know the perfect place
to take you.

207
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,640
-Ohh!
-Oh dear Lord.

208
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,480
-This will be fun. [laughs]
-What did I get myself into?

[female voice] Good morning,
Brother Ejike.

220
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,920
I hope you are
enjoying your trip to Nigeria.

221
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,760
So far, so good. How far?

222
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,800
You are looking good.
Tunde is taking really good care of you.

223
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,720
Hmm! That one? Do I even get to see him?

224
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,640
He is always off to one
political thing or the other.

225
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,800
That's a good thing because it means
politics is actually working out for him.

226
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,560
Hmmn, well yes.

227
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,600
I guess he’s trying
to be like your father.

228
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,440
Hoping one day to become Senate President.

229
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,760
Yeah, that would be something.

230
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,560
But look, listen

231
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,680
I just had like the weirdest
conversation with my mum.

232
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,560
She’s trying a little too
hard to get me to go to Abuja.

233
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,360
I feel like there’s
something else going on. What is it?

234
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,400
Why do you think so?

235
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,480
Hey, come on, we both know that woman.

236
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,800
She doesn’t do anything for no reason.

237
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,160
-What's going on?
-[laughs]

238
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,520
Ah, I don't know.

239
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,640
-Come on.
-Come to think of it.

240
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,840
Maybe she wants to find you a wife

241
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,880
as you’ve refused to bring one home.

242
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
[Keme laughs]

243
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,880
-You guys are trying to find me a wife?
-Hmm-mmn

244
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,240
I can find a woman by myself.
Thank you so much.

245
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,640
Okay, then you better
hurry up and bring one home.

246
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,320
You know Aunty does
not take "No" for an answer.

247
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,280
Yeah, I can't even
deal with you guys, alright?

248
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,440
-I will see you later.
-Okay.

249
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,000
[grunts]

250
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,120
Don't bother coming to Abuja again.

251
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,640
He won’t even consider it.

252
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,040
Perfect.

253
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,080
Don’t worry about it.

254
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,480
I'll bring him over to Abuja next week.

255
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,600
-We'll see you there.
-[female voice ] Hello, Aunty.

256
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,400
Hello yourself.

257
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,400
Nma, haven’t I told
you to stop sneaking up on me?

258
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,360
I didn't sneak up on you.
I walked leisurely in.

259
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,840
[long hiss]

260
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,200
Did you see Sisi Toyin
when you picked up Kemi?

261
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,240
Uhhm no,
it was really early in the morning,

262
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,080
so she might have
been sleeping when I got there.

263
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,640
I didn't go upstairs, so I don't know.

264
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,120
Oh, that's okay.

265
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,920
I... guess I’ll call her later.

266
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,280
I can't make Bible study today.

267
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,440
I'm sure she wouldn't mind.
I mean she knows Charlie's around, so...

268
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,480
-Oh, speaking of Charlie,
-hmm-mm

269
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,560
His friend seemed like a... nice boy.

270
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,600
Yeah, he is.

271
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,080
I saw the way he was looking at you.

272
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,480
Mum, don't start jumping the gun now.

273
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,200
I'm not jumping the gun, and I’m
not saying anything that I didn’t see.

274
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,640
All I'm saying is,
I saw the way he was looking at you

275
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,080
and I bet you anything,
he’ll be here soon enough.

276
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,480
I'm sure he will be here soon enough, mum.

277
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,920
I mean, Charlie is his friend.
So yes, he will come back.

278
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,960
That is not what I meant, but never mind.

279
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,240
Trust me, he’ll be back.

280
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,960
Mum, you know I'm not
looking for a relationship right now.

281
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,920
All I want to do is focus
on God and my career, that's it.

282
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,800
Hmmn

283
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,760
Honey, you do
realize you’re only saying that

284
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,240
because... you haven't met the right
man yet?

285
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,560
When you do,
just like I did meet your father,

286
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,040
-Hmmm?
-Everything will fall into place.

287
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,320
You don’t have to be single to serve God,

288
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,240
you can serve him while married.

289
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,680
I did, and so are
countless women out there.

290
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,520
All you have to do is just
open your heart to the will of God.

You’ve literally been on your phone
since I got here, is everything okay?

297
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,080
Ah, I’m tired,
my cousin promised to call me

298
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,720
for a business proposition I made to him.

299
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,320
Oh, is this the cousin
you were telling me about?

300
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,480
The one that’s in the States?
When am I meeting him?

301
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,840
You’ll meet him soon.
He's quite busy at the moment.

302
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,480
He and one of his friends are
trying to set up

303
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,600
venture capital for businesses in
Nigeria, he can impact lots of Nigerians.

304
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,720
Wow! That is such a strange coincidence.

305
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,720
Charlie and his friend are
literally doing the same thing.

306
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
-Really?
-Yes. Maybe we should introduce them.

307
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,720
What do you think?

308
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,880
Probably after
Teni’s wedding or what do you think?

309
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,560
Yes, that’s a good idea.

310
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,880
So, what does Charlie's friend look like?

311
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,240
He's hot. Very hot.

312
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,680
Well, do I smell an attraction?

313
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,440
Kemi, am I not
allowed to just admire someone

314
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,760
without you thinking
that there is something there?

315
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,320
Okay, now give me the details,
full details.

316
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,720
I want to listen.

317
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,280

a really good first impression.

00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,240
-Let me ask you something.
-[Hawker] Okay, sir.

341
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,600
-Did you go to school?
-No, sir.

342
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,920
-[in pidgin] You never went to school?
-Yes.

343
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,480
How come?

344
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,120
[in pidgin] Sir, no money …
Look at my beards

345
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,440
[in pidgin] I haven’t eaten
since morning, sir. Please buy, please.

346
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,120
Do you have any Naira on you?

347
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,920
No, unfortunately not.

348
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,560
Err, hold on,
I should have some change somewhere.

349
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,240
Okay, just give me one.

350
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,400
[in pidgin] Emeka, bring a paper bag
for me.

351
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,560
-It's fine, keep the change.
-God bless you. Sir, thank you so much.

352
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,319
‪Emeka!‬

353
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,640
‪So what's this mystery man’s name?‬

354
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,118
-Keme.
-Keme?

355
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,520
Keme, sounds romantic. Lola and Ke--

356
00:17:24,598 --> 00:17:28,280
Kemi! There is no by Lola and Keme or Loke

357
00:17:28,358 --> 00:17:29,960
or whatever happening, please.

358
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,720
Okay, it’s fine.

359
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,920
So what’s happening tomorrow morning?
Are we still on for the market?

360
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,880
Yes we are. Bright and early,
so you need to be ready.

361
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,640
-So set your alarm.
-[sighs]

362
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,760
But Lola, please, why can’t Teni

363
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,000
just hire a professional wedding planner?

364
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,720
I don’t have to wake up
every weekend for this please.

365
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,840
Kemi, why are you complaining?

366
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,080
-You know, you like it.
-I don’t.

367
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,400
[laughter]

368
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,520
So how did it go at the market?
I hope you got all you wanted.

369
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,040
Oh yes, we did.
Lola has such an eye for beautiful stuff.

370
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,720
Must you give Lola so much credit?

371
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,680
You are as talented as she is,
if not more.

372
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,640
It's okay, mum,

373
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,400
I am confident in my abilities

374
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,400
and I do not have a problem
with recognizing how gifted Lola is.

375
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,400
But mum, where is this coming from?

376
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,320
I'm just tired of "Lola this, Lola that",

377
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,240
you deserve some credit too.

378
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,120
Ok, thanks for looking out for me,
mum, but I am super cool with Lola.

379
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,760
[laughs sarcastically]

380
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,720
I don't know how you can be.

381
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,840
After the stunt she pulled with Femi.

382
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,400
-She ruined your engagement.
-Oh come on, mum

383
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,480
we both know it wasn’t Lola's fault.

384
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,600
Femi is such a horrible person

385
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,480
Lola did nothing wrong.

386
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,560
Well, that’s not how I remember it.

387
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,240
It's fine, but I think we’ll...
agree to disagree then.

388
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,720
[car engines revving]

389
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,680
[door opens and closes]

390
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,680
-[Charlie] I'm sorry.
-What happened?

391
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,600
I'm sorry, sorry, I’m just coming.

392
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,800
The traffic in this town is... terrible

393
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,560
Third mainland was blocked.

394
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,120
We had to go through Yaba and Eko bridge.
Thank God for Lola who knows all the ways.

395
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,080
Well then, how is... Lola?

396
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,920
She's great, I suppose.

397
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:41,240
Yes, definitely.
Your sister is, she is something else.

398
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,040
Yea, I think so too.

399
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,080
Why do you sound like that?

400
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,120
Why do you have
that look on your face, Keme?

401
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,800
Alright, fine, fine.
Since we're here and we’re doing this

402
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,400
Yes, I've been actually
meaning to talk to you about this.

403
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,240
-Hmmn...
-I know it's kind of weird, but I like her

404
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,160
As in, I really like her.

405
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,400
You think she would
agree to go on a date with me?

406
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,800
Why don't you ask her?

407
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,080
Wait, you are actually cool with this?

408
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,200
No, I'm not.

409
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,640
-Oh my bad.
-[laughs] I’m just kidding, come on.

410
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,320
I can't think of nobody better.

411
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,360
[clears throat]

412
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,240
Hey man, I appreciate this, seriously.

413
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,720
-[chuckles]
-No, seriously.

414
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,160
-It means a lot to me.
-No problem, no problem.

415
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,160
-I won't let you down.
-Oh, no <i>wahala</i>.

416
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,880
-Let's get to business.
-Alright.

417
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,880
We are ready to see her now,

418
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,760
if you can just give her a ring.
Tell her we're here.

419
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,200
[in Yoruba] Iya Dundun.
Please, let me have

420
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,080
three wraps of amala, and meat.

421
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,840
-[Iya Dundun] Okay, how many meats?
-Uhmm...

422
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,040
Two each. Make it goat meat and beef,
okay?

423
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,840
Any <i>ponmo</i>?

424
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,440
These ones are <i>ajebo</i>,
they can’t eat <i>ponmo</i>, just--

425
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,040
No, no, no, I will
have some <i>ponmo</i>, thank you very much.

426
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,400
-[laughs]
-Why not?

427
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,280
Mehn, how's the…

428
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,840
-Thank you.
-[Charlie] Thank you, man.

429
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,440
How’s the wedding planning going?

430
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,520
-Maaan! It’s going good
-Yes.

431
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,400
I learned something very early on.

432
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,960
[Keme] What’s that?

433
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,560
The wedding belongs to the bride.

434
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,440
I simply do as I'm
told and we’re all happy.

435
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,280
So I hear.

436
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,320
And Lola is doing an amazing job.

437
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,560
Of course, she’s amazing.

438
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,440
I don’t know how she finds the time

439
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,040
to do all the things she gets to do.

440
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,200
It’s like she can out plan
any event planner in the world.

441
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,960
-[Charlie] That's crazy.
-I tell you what?

442
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,840
I mean, all of her creativity and style,

443
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,640
-Simple, but classy.
-Classy, yes.

444
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,720
she just seems like
that kind of person, you know?

445
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,680
She’s just that kind of person,
that's all.

446
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,040
-Hmm!
-Hmm!

447
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,840
Why do you have that look on your face?

448
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,600
Hey, you think we didn’t see how
you were staring at her the other night?

449
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,480
Are you guys being serious right now?

450
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,000
I can’t say someone is incredible anymore,

451
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,640
I can’t just
compliment your sister in peace.

452
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,920
-[Josh] this is the food, let's dig in.
-Yes good idea.

453
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,680
So?

454
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,680
I could actually get into this.

455
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,120
-It’s actually pretty nice.
-[Keme] Not bad at all.

456
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,160
The amala is soft,
the soup tastes really delicious.

457
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,440
-[Charlie] It's pretty good, actually.
-Hmm!

458
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,480
Iya Dundun is the best.

459
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,320
So, guys, this is my business idea.

460
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,880
[In Yoruba] Joshua, <i>buka</i>?

461
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,160
You want to open a <i>buka</i>?

462
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,400
Listen up guys.

463
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,680
It is a bukateria par excellence.

464
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,240
[sighs]

465
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,960
What I’m trying to do is
blend the local traditional <i>buka</i>

466
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,240
with the modern-day fast food joint.

467
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,880
-That could actually work.
-Yeah.

468
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,600
Ah, who do we have here?

469
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,080
Ehhhh!

470
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,600
[Lola] Hello.

471
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,920
-Awww, how are you?
-I'm fine, thank you.

472
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,240
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

473
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,680
-Good to see you.
-Same here.

474
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,600
How are you?

475
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,760
-I’m okay.
-Good. Business is looking good.

476
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,000
-Thank you.
-Well done.

477
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,040
Thank you, thank you.

478
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,680
Ah, Auntie Lola!

479
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,560
Efe, I didn't know you were in town now.

480
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,480
-How are you?
-I’m fine o, I’m fine.

481
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,080
That’s good. How is the job search going?

482
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,560
You know Nigeria, my dear. If you’re
not connected with people in high places,

483
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,560
you can be sure,
your hope of getting a job is very slim.

484
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,240
But you know, we are children of God,

485
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,360
so Efe, your own case will be different.

486
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,120
[All] Amen.

487
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,760
Although, I just got a job

488
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,200
as a security guard to a politician’s
wife.

489
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,640
A friend of mine recommended me,
and I should start soon, by next week.

490
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
I mean... I just

491
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,280
I really hope they are good.

492
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,400
Not the one they’ll
come and turn you into a thug.

493
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,440
[both] Ah, God forbid.

494
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,120
-[Woman] Never, My son? Never.
-[Efe] God forbid

495
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,920
Just don't do that.

496
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,040
[indistinct shouting]

497
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,040
-Allow me to kill this evil child.
-Don’t you have shame?

498
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,000
You want to kill your daughter?

499
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,080
Why won't I kill her?

500
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,280
[Man] This girl is a demon child.

501
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,720
She is an <i>Ogbanje</i> child.

502
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,640
She has been taking
all my money to the coven.

503
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,480
And this same child has
been collapsing my businesses,

504
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,040
and everything that I put my hands into.

505
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,800
And you think killing your child
will solve your financial troubles?

506
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,040
Yes Madam.

507
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,280
At least no body will be
taking my money to the coven.

508
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,120
It's okay, thank you.

509
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,080
-I'll take her, you don't have to worry--
-You can have her.

510
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,800
What kind of a man are you?

511
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,920
[Man] Byebye!

512
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,280
Eh, what's this torture?

513
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,600
I don't know how you do it.

514
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,200
-Do what?
-Give, give, and give.

515
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,200
It is my Christian duty as a believer.

516
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,920
If I don't, who will?

517
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,960
This is what we are called to do.

518
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,640
Do you even know her name?

519
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,640
We’ll look for a name for her,

520
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,120
and have her dedicated in the church.

521
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,600
You know... What do you think
about Esther?

522
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,680
Esther, that's a lovely name.

523
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,560
The orphan who became a queen.

524
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,040
Madam Eloha...

525
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,680
it's so beautiful.

526
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,480
You’ve really outdone yourself this time.

527
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,800
Teni is gonna be so happy, honestly.

528
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,440
-Thank you.
-We thank God, we thank God.

529
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,480
I will get the reception
dress ready by tomorrow evening.

530
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,920
-Thank you.
-Okay.

531
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,080
And by the way,

532
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,680
when are we getting
the invitation to your wedding?

533
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,360
[laughs] Well... there is someone.

534
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,280
Yes, I met him through Charlie…

535
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,280
-Wow.
-And I think he likes me.

536
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,400
Wow.

537
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,440
-Do you like him?
-Yes.

538
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,240
Is he a born again?

539
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,160
Have you prayed about it?

540
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,000
In that case, what... are you waiting for?

541
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,000
Please just hold this one, okay?

542
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,320
Just use it to buy food and clothes
for the little one, please.

543
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,880
Thank you very much, Lola.

544
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,360
You’ve been very good to my family and I.

545
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,200
Thank you so much.

546
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,520
The Lord will replenish your purse.

547
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,120
Amen, amen.

548
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,200
-[Keme] Ready for this?
-[Charlie] Please...

549
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,920
[Keme] Bro, you have no idea
what is about to hit you.

550
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,360
-I get it.
-Thank you so much.

551
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,800
-When you're done boasting--
-No no no.

552
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,080
Just because I don't live here anymore

553
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,120
doesn’t mean I don't
know how whoop your behind.

554
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,720
One, two, three, come on.

555
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,680
[Charlie] Okay, Okay.

556
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,960
-[Keme] Keep going
-[light hearted music]

557
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,320
-[Keme] That's it.
-Hey.

558
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,680
[both] Hey.

559
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,640
-Let me get that for you.
-Oh, thank you.

560
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,440
That’s... really sweet of you.

561
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,240
[Lola] Great to see you again.

562
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,000
Great to see you too, Lola.

563
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,760
What's going on? You seem like you had
a busy day.

564
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,200
Really busy day. I had to pick up
the bridesmaid's dresses

565
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,520
You know, for the wedding.

566
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,480
-Right
-You're coming to the wedding, right?

567
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,000
Uhh, I will, yes,

568
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,280
if you promise to save me a dance.

569
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,280
Uhhmm...

570
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,160
I don't know because
it’s gonna be really hectic

571
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,040
with the whole wedding
and my friend’s not around.

572
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,720
So, it’s just, I don't know.

573
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,640
That’s too bad, because
that's my condition If I’m gonna attend.

574
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,920
-Uhhmm...
-Come on.

575
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,760
-Just one dance?
-One dance.

576
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,840
Seriously, one dance.

577
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,800
-[laughs] Okay, fine.
-Yes? Wonderful.

578
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,640
Now I can start
looking forward to this wedding.

579
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,560
And you my darling
sister has just been played.

580
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,200
You know he was going to
come to wedding anyway, right?

581
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,440
And who told
you that I wasn’t playing him?

582
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,960
[Lola chuckles]

583
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,800
Bye guys.

584
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,080
[Charlie] Keme!

585
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,680
-Right!
-Sit!

586
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,840
[Keme] Whose turn, whose turn?

587
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,720
What did I tell you?

588
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,880
Uhmm, I don't remember,
Mum. What did you tell me?

589
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,800
Didn't I tell
you that he was going to come back?

590
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,920
Really?

591
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,520
Alright, fine, mom,
you did tell me. You were right.

592
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,480
So... did he say anything?

593
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,360
Well, he wants me to dance
with him at Teni's wedding.

594
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,080
And?

595
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,120
-I agreed.
-You agreed.

596
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,320
Well, that's a surprise.

597
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,840
Sounds like you like him too, huh?

598
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,960
Mum, slow down, slow down.

599
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,120
Look, we're gonna take
this one step at a time, ok?

600
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,040
It's just a dance.

601
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,760
-Oh, I'm not rushing.
-Yes, you are .

602
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,920
I just figured [clears throat]

603
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,840
Take a date now and you never know.
[laughs]

604
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,000
-Wedding? Baby?
-Mum!

605
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,080
‪[mum giggles]‬

606
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,440
‪[laughs]‬

607
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,480
Ah! Wait, why did it get
quiet all of a sudden?

608
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,880
[Charlie and Keme laugh]

609
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,720
No, no, no, we are innocent boys.

610
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,640
Well Keme, I hope your parents won’t mind

611
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,480
that you’re gonna
spend time with us. For dinner?

612
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,240
Oh yes, that would be fantastic.
It smells really good.

613
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,160
My parents are in Abuja,
so they’re not gonna mind.

614
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,680
Oh great.

615
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,600
What... do they do exactly?

616
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,240
My dad works for the government

617
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,320
and my mum is a business woman.

618
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,400
Oh that’s nice.

619
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,040
What kind of businesswoman is she?

620
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,480
Mum, can you please
stop interrogating him?

621
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,000
You'll chase him away before dinner.

622
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,520
That’s what you call
getting to know someone lately?

623
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,640
-It’s interrogation?
-[laughs]

624
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,520
I won’t want to... run you out of here,

625
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,280
but I just want to remind
you that get your palates ready

626
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,440
My daughter is preparing a lovely dinner,

627
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,640
Sweet potato porridge with fresh fish.

628
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,080
That sounds very tasty.
I'm looking forward to dinner already.

629
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,920
Right? She's a great cook.

630
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,640
-[Mum] Right?
-Mum, yes, yes, yes, she is a great cook.

631
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,640
Sure.

632
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,120
She is. [laughs]

633
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,920
[laughs] My mum.

634
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,480
Hello Charlie, you’re welcome.

635
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,160
-And Ejikeme, you’re welcome.
-Nice to see you, sir.

636
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,240
-Good to see you guys.
-Thank you

637
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,160
Hello sir.

-So great to see you.
-Thank you.

639
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,560
And I'm so delighted
that you have a great interest in RILA,

640
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,880
-Helping us to promote RILA.
-Yes, yes.

641
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,320
You are welcome, do sit down.

642
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,520
Thank you for having us.

643
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,680
-Thank you so much.
-You are welcome.

644
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,880
We applaud what you are doing

645
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,040
-with the academy
-Yes.

646
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,040
And we would like to partner
with you to expand the courses

647
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,960
and maybe bring a few
campuses to the United States.

648
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,880
If possible, yes.

649
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,360
-[Charlie] That’s the plan
-[Keme] That's the plan

650
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,280
This is great, Charlie and Ejikeme.

651
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,200
Great news to my ears.

652
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,640
I must sincerely thank you,
because we have been looking for partners,

653
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,600
strategic partners, to help us advance

654
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,400
the cause of what we are doing globally.

655
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,680
[Both] Okay.

656
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,840
That’s actually perfect, then,

657
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,760
because we just felt that coming
now was a bit of the right time.

658
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,160
We’re really interested in the course

659
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,040
that focuses on building
apostles in the marketplace.

660
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,800
-Yes Yes Yes.
-Yes, we felt that that kind of thing

661
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,960
would really hit our target demographic.

662
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,600
Yes, we would like to, you know,

663
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,240
set up strategic meetings

664
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,760
with church leaders
across the United States.

665
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,440
-Great.
-And then have you come over

666
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,800
To talk in some of these churches,

667
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,560
-To share the RILA vision--
-Share the message.

668
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,200
-Yes.
-Beautiful, beautiful.

669
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:25,760
That’s great, because...
that is the major area of our focus.

670
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,000
We’re raising Christian
leaders who function in the marketplace.

671
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:36,240
And your coming is like the biblical
story of Aaron and Hur in the Bible.

672
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,000
-[Both laugh].
-that lifted up the hands of Moses

673
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,520
Yes Yes.

674
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,840
In battle until the victory was won.

675
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,280
Absolutely.

676
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,080
The Lord will greatly bless you

677
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,600
-[Charlie] Amen.
-for taking this step.

678
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,800
-Thank you so much
-Thank you.

679
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,920
So if it is alright with you,

680
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,600
we just wanted to run
you by a couple of the strategies

681
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,680
that we have for making this work.

682
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,160
-[Charlie] So, that was interesting.
-Yes, I think we’re making progress

683
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,680
Yes Yes. I think so.

684
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,720
Where's the driver?

685
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,040
I don't know, I have no idea.

686
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,760
He’s probably parked somewhere else.
You know how hard it is getting parking--

687
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,680
Alright, what are
you doing for the rest of the day?

688
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,800
Josh.

689
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,960
-I have to see Josh.
-Okay,

690
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,280
You guys have the wedding vows to make

691
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,320
-Yes
-Yes, I don't think I’m trying to do that,

692
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,080
-so you guys have fun.
-[laughs]

693
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,960
And I'll find something to do.

694
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,680
-Alright man.
-I'll just take a walk.

695
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,840
-Take it easy, huh?
-Alright.

696
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,280
[lighthearted music]

697
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,280
[Keme] Lola.

698
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,800
Keme.

699
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
Hi.

700
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,320
Fancy meeting you here.

701
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,560
Hey.

702
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,360
-What's up?
-I'm good.

703
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,200
What are you doing here?

704
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,920
I just finished a meeting with Charlie.

705
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,640
We had the RILA thing
so we just came from there,

706
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,840
but he had to go do something with Joshua,
for the wedding.

707
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:57,320
So, I'm kind of bored,
I was just strolling around.

708
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,560
What are you doing here?

709
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,840
Oh! My office is literally just there,
around the corner.

710
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,840
-Okay. Alright.
-Yea

711
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,440
Uhhm...

712
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,120
Do you want some yoghurt?

713
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,480
I don’t mind.

714
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,680
Frozen yoghurt.

715
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,000
Ok, alright.

716
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,400
What do we have here?

717
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,640
Alright, you can get the strawberry.

718
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,000
I think I'm gonna try... sweet kiwi.

719
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,000
Yea, that's me.

720
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,120
Thanks for the treat.

721
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,880
My pleasure.

722
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,440
No, I should be the one saying that.

723
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,040
I’ve actually enjoyed
spending time with you.

724
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,240
[clears throat]

725
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,760
-Likewise.
-Likewise?

726
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,000
Alright, I’ve enjoyed
spending time with you too.

727
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,280
-There we go, it wasn't so hard.
-[chuckles]

728
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,600
Uhhm...

729
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,960
So listen, you think
we can do this again, sometime?

730
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,960
Yes.

731
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,840
Yeah, because I’m trying
to get to know you a little better.

732
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,120
If you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to
take you on a date or two or three.

733
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,800
Let's start with one.

734
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,720
Okay. Alright, we can do one.

735
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,360
How about Sunday, after church?

736
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,480
Let's have lunch.

737
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,360
-It’s a date.
-Yeah?

738
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,159
-Yeah.
-Okay, perfect.

739
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,760
‪Okay...‬

740
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,560
What's happening?
Why do you have that look on your face?

741
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,159
All is well.

742
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,440
It's just that Otunba Ayodeji
has asked your father

743
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,760
to be his running
mate in the next elections.

744
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,880
Ok, that's… Dad,
Congratulations, that's amazing

745
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,880
But I'm pretty that the election literally
just ended. The next one is in four years?

746
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,560
Yes, definitely.

747
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,840
The election cycle runs
immediately. Four years, yes.

748
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,640
Ok, so he’s asked you to
be his running mate in four years.

749
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,560
Yes.

750
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,960
You see, we... have to
put this like in lock down,

751
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,840
so that he doesn't change his mind.

752
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,680
And that is why we have arranged for

753
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,600
you to marry his only daughter. That way,

754
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,600
two powerful families,

755
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,960
become a formidable dynasty.

756
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,640
[laughter]

757
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,760
Wait.

758
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,040
Come on guys, we're... joking, right?

759
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,600
Do we look like we’re joking?

760
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,160
Okay.

761
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,400
Let me umm,

762
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,400
Let me understand this.

763
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,600
You want me to marry someone.

764
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,000
As in actually "marry someone",
someone's daughter,

765
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,640
because you want to
secure a running mate postion,

766
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,560
four years down the line?

767
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,320
Oh no, son, son, son.

768
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,640
Don't take it like that,
it might sound weird

769
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,800
but you see, this is a family decision.

770
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,080
How is this a family decision, dad?

771
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,600
this has nothing to do with family.
This is about you and I'm sorry

772
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,480
but this is about
you and your ambition, that's fine.

773
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,320
You want to be
president one day, that’s okay.

774
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,120
But why do I have to
be the sacrificial lamb?

775
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,160
Oh, stop being so dramatic.

776
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,960
Nobody is trying to sacrifice you.

777
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,120
I mean, this is
an alliance of two families

778
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,080
for the benefit of both sides.

779
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,000
Okay.

780
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,880
I thought you would know me better by now,

781
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,040
but I can only marry somebody

782
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,400
that God has actually destined
for me, mum.

783
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,920
If I am going to get married

784
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,240
it has to be the will of God.

785
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,280
Ejike, I understand you.

786
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,400
You are born again.

787
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,200
-I am.
-And you believe in the... will of God.

788
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,840
-I do.
-But... so do I.

789
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,200
-So do we.
-So what are you saying?

790
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,200
We believe in the will of God.

791
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,400
and you have not seen this girl.

792
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,120
She is beautiful, elegant,
classy, and she is successful.

793
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,040
Look, I have her on my Facebook.

794
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,280
She’s on your Facebook?

795
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,640
Guys, can you can you…

796
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,560
Mum, dad, can you not hear yourselves?

797
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,560
It sounds like a bad comedy.

798
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,840
Can you please put that phone down?

799
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,720
She can be Miss world, Miss universe

800
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,680
Miss everything rolled into one,
but it’s not gonna happen.

801
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,560
[Keme] Ok mum, I'm sorry.

802
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,760
And dad, let me you ask for something.

803
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,000
Let's say I marry this girl, okay?

804
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,440
We actually get married and then,
four years down the line, Otunba decides,

805
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,040
"Hey, I need someone
more strategic as a partner."

806
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,480
then he dumps you. What happens to me?

807
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,080
I will divorce her immediately,
I'll pay for the divorce.

808
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,160
Wow! I love you both.
But sometimes I cannot deal with you.

809
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,720
You do realize these are
people's lives that you're discussing.

810
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,840
Oh, stop making it sound so evil.
Everybody does this.

811
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,200
But I'm not everyone, and neither are you.

812
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,200
So what do we…

813
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,200
Look, mum, dad,

814
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,440
Maybe this doesn't
make sense to you, I get that.

815
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,880
But I'm the son of
the most high God, okay?

816
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,360
And I have to at least
try to be led by the Spirit,

817
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,200
not the flesh.

818
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,440
So I... refuse to play these games
with you.

819
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,880
Did you just say you refuse? You refuse?

820
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,520
Who the hell do you think you are?

821
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,080
I am your father.

822
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,240
Now, these same
strategies you dismiss as games,

823
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,400
That has paid your fees
and made you whoever you are.

824
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,400
You will obey me!

mum,

828
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,600
I love you both, okay?
I’m sure you both know that,

829
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,200
but you can't force me to do this.

830
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,520
Look, I'm 30 years old, okay?

831
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,560
And I haven't lived at
home in the last decade.

832
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,120
So, with all due respect, sir,

833
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,760
I don't have to do anything.

835
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,400
I can find a God-fearing wife

Nice and pretty, all by myself.

837
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,800

It was... interesting.

842
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,000
I do think some of
the girls should have been

843
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,880
a little more modestly dressed though

844
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,520
Well, that's how
these girls dress nowadays.

855
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,600
Oh right, you're the designer.

856
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,200
-This is your collection, right?
-Yes I am.

857
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,320
I hope you enjoyed it.

858
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,320

Good afternoon ma.

868
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,360
Your mummy just left. She left in a taxi.

869
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,960
She waited for a long time.

870
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,440
I know, I knew she would leave.
The traffic was so bad today, honestly.

871
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,440
-[in Yoruba] Ah, sorry.
-Thank you.

872
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,800
Okay, let me go.

873
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,240
-Salute her, ehn
-I will

874
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,920

-My Yewande
-How are you?

876
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,160
I'm fine.

877
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,760
That was a beautiful show.

878
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,320
-Oh thank you.
-Oh yes.

879
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,960

-How are you, my lovely
-I didn't know you were coming.

881
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,840
Oh, and thanks for
the perfume you bought me.

882
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,080
I was going to come to
the house personally to thank you.

883
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,600
You’re not supposed to
thanking me for stuff like that, Aunty.

884
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,680
I'm just glad you like it, that's all.

885
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,720
I like it. I’ll use it once a year

887
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,480

a beautiful fashion show.

-Thank you
-And your designs

889
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,000
Very beautiful. Wonderful

890
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,280
Your parents must be really proud.

891
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,320
Well, my mum is ,I don't
know about my dad, he never has time,

892
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,000
he is always very busy politicking.

893
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,520
Hold on. Your dad is a politician too?

894
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,080
Yes, you didn't know?
My dad is Otunba Ayodeji.

895
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,200
Yes now.

896
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,360
Yewande, it was wonderful

897
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,680
-to run into you.
-[Wande] Oh, thank you.

898
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,560
-We’ve got to leave now.
-Okay.

899
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,600
-Sister Nneka.
-Yes, see you soon.

Auntie, it was good to see you.

-Yes, yes indeed, my dear.
-Wande.

902

-Yes, it was a pleasure to meet you
-It was a pleasure.

903
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,400
-Okay.
-Excuse me, just a second.

904
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,600
Mum, no, no, no.

905
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,240
Mum, how much of today was a coincidence?

906
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,200
What do you mean?

907
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,560
Why did you bring me here?

908
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,760
To watch a fashion show.

909
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,960
[sighs]

910
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,520
Look. It... was a fashion show
for charity,

911
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,800
and I know you love things like that.

912
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,560
Mum, I'm not joking.

913
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,720
OK, alright.

914
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,000
I just wanted you to meet her.

915
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,880
You know,

916
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,640
you refuse to look at
her on my Facebook page.

917
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,120
Can you stop with the Facebook…?

918
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,080
[sighs]

919
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,360
What you did was wrong, okay?

920
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,440
I wanted you to make an informed decision.

921
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,120
There is no decision to make.

922
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,680
I am not going to marry that girl.

923
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,200

-Oh, stop being so stubborn.

924

to take our relationship

968
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,680

969
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,760
Are you sure about how you feel about me?

970

-One hundred per cent?
-One hundred per cent.

971
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,560
Then that's what we need.

972
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,680
I mean, I’ve just always believed that

973
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,240
if God is in something... you just know.

974
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,920
And... I’ve known
that you are the woman for me,

975
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,200
since the very first second I saw you,
at the house, with the meat pies

976
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,960
-and the drinks and everything
-[laughs]

977
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,680
I just knew.

978
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,440
I knew it too.

979
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,520
And every time I try
to fight these feelings,

980
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,440
for you, they just get stronger.

981
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,200
So...

982
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,920
Yes, I will marry you.

983
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,480
Yes Yes.

984
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,760
Wait, seriously?

985
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,440
-Yes.
-[laughs] Are you serious?

986
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,360
Hmmmnn....

987
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,440
Oh sorry, sorry. Am I squeezing you?

988
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,560
-You actually said "Yes".
-I can’t believe you asked.

989
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,800
I'm not sure what I was… Wait, wait,

990
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,760
now you are definitely
going to think I’m crazy, but...

991
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,600
I know I already seem really crazy, but

992
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,880
I already ordered the ring.

993
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,800
Okay [laughs]

994
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,720
Yes, I couldn’t wait for it to arrive.

995
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,840
So I'm just gonna give you this instead.

996
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,520
It belonged to my grandmother.

997
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,520
It was important to her,
so she wore it every day,

998
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,760
every single day until the day she died.

999
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,880
So, I want you to have this,

1000
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,480
so you can wear it every day.

1001
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,080
It will remind you of how I feel
about you.

1002
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,440
-May I?
-Yes.

1003
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,360
-Yes?
-Yes.

1004
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,960
There we go.

1005
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,800
-Yes, no, no, no, let people see it, yes.
-[laughs]

1006
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,400
There we go, look at that.

1007
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,040
I will cherish this every single day

1008
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,560
for the rest of my life.

1009
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,800
You should come over to my house.

1010
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,000
We're having this
birthday party for my dad.

1011
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,720
It's his 60th birthday,
so it’s like a big thing.

1012
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,120
You should come as my guest.

1013
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,160
Do you think I should actually come?

1014
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,440
I mean, what will your parents say?

1015
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,400
Do they know about me?

1016
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,480
Oh, they'll find out when they meet you.

1017
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,880
Look, I just want them
to meet you, you know?

1018
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,520
Get to know you the way I have.

1019
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:57,920
Come on, say "Yes".

1020
00:47:59,040 --> 00:47:59,880
Yes, I'll come.

1021
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,520
-Yes, yes?
-Yes.

1022
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,000
You have no idea how happy you’ve made me.

1023
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,240
Ha! I’m getting married.

1024
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,000
-I love you.
-I love you too.

1026
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,680
[water running]

1027
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,440
Oh wow, it all sounds so exciting.

1028
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,720
Hmm-nnn

1029
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,960
And he said I should wear it everyday

1030
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,400
as a token of his love for me.

1031
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,240
Honey, it is beautiful.

1032
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,480
Mum, you don't sound happy for me.

1033
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,920
Oh come on, honey.

1034
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,560
Of course, I'm happy for you sweetheart.

1035
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:54,960
Why wouldn’t I be?

1036
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,000
Honey, I’m just… [clears throat]

1037
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,960
I just feel you're moving a bit too fast.

1038
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,760
I mean, you’ve only known him what?

1039
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,160
All of two weeks.

1040
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,320
Look honey, I'm worried

1041
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,840
we don't know anything about his family.

1042
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,240
And every time we bring it up,
he clams up.

1043
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:23,040
Even Charlie has no
idea what his parents do.

1044
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,840
Mum, it doesn't matter.

1045
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,080
He is the one.

1046
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,280
Huh?

1047
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,440
How can you be so sure?

1048
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,200
Barely two weeks ago
you weren’t ready for marriage.

1049
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,160
Now you are engaged.

1050
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,640
Look, mum, I can't explain it, okay?

1051
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,880
I just know. I can feel it, mum, I know.

1052
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,480
He’s the one, mum.

1053
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,640
Okay.

1054
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,040
Well, call it a mother's intuition,

1055
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,800
we know nohing about his family.

1056
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,680
Please, can you just be happy for me,
please?

1057
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,960
I will meet his parents
at his dad's 60th birthday,

1058
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,760
and everything’s gonna go well.

1059
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,200
And then you’ll be
able to meet his parents

1060
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,400
and ask all the questions you have, mum,

1061
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,320
All of them.

1062
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,080
Okay, if you put it that way, honey.

1063
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,920
Let's go.

1064
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,440
Okay.

1065
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,400
Lola, I need you to style me.

1066
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,440
for what?

1067
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,320
It's my Aunty's husband’s 60th birthday.

1068
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,400
Oh, is that the one that’s
arranging a wife for his son?

1069
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,680
Yes, I heard from the family grapevine,

1070
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,520
That it’s already a done
deal and Otunba is even coming

1071
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,120
with their daughter for the announcement.

1072
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,280
Wow, okay, fine.

1073
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,840
Let me see what I can do.

1074
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,200
[clears throat] So, I’m actually
going to a 60th birthday party myself

1075
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:45,240
-Really?
-Hmmn

1076
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,360
And who is it?

1077
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,120
Do you remember Charlie's friend, Keme?

1078
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,080
-The hot guy now.
-Ahnahn!

1079
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,120
Oh my God. [laughs]

1080
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,160
I do not
remember him because I haven't met him.

1081
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,680
But girl, that’s great.

1082
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,440
I wish I'm coming with you.

1083
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,360
No, please,

1084
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,640
come and be going to
that your engagement party.

1085
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,920
I'll give you all the gist later.

1086
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
-What?
-And listen, if all goes well, I might

1087
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,560
have a special announcement later tonight.

1088
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,600
-What?
-Yes.

1089
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,160
What? You need to fill me in, everything.

1090
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,080
-No
-Let's go.

1091
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,000
Wait, you need to give me everything
in detail.

1092
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,680
-[Lola] You love gist, let's go.
-[Kemi] Of course I love gist

1093
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:21,880
[dance music]

1094
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,480
[Keme] Mum, you’ve outdone
yourself this time, seriously.

1095
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,480
-Yes, this looks fantastic.
-Thank you.

1096
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,160
[Keme] Listen, I invited
two friends over. I hope that’s okay.

1097
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,520
Why didn't you tell me?

1098
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,080
Mum, it’s two friends.

1099
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,880
I had planned something
nice and intimate for your father.

1100
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,560
[Keme] this is nice and intimate

1101
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,960
Well, I guess two extra
people won’t do any harm

1102
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,800
Thank you, thank you.

1103
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,280
And are they the ones
that have kept you out.

1104
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,720
for so long?

1105
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,400
And, your recent good mood?

1106
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,240
You do realize I'm
here on a business trip, right?

1107
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,560
So obviously I’m not gonna be at home.

1108
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,160
I have to go out and do things

1109
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,720
and what’s wrong with having a good mood.

1110
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,080
[Mum] I like your cologne.

1111
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,040
-Mum, please, not today.
-[laughs]

1112
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,840
-I think someone needs you over there.
-When did you start using cologne?

1113
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,840
Mum, give me a break.

1114
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:23,680
[Keme] When my friends come

1115
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,480
You’ll get all the answers you need, okay?

1116
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,920
But seriously, good job.

1117
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,720
Thank you.

1118
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,160
And please, no more surprises.

1119
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:38,240
I have prepared something really
special for your father.

1120
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,000
I don't want it to be ruined.

1121
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,760
[sighs] Yes, mum.

1122
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,120

-Hi again.
-Hi.

1125
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,640
I just wanted to thank
you for coming to the fashion show.

1126
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,520
It was really nice chatting with you.

1127
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,800
No, absolutely, absolutely.

1128
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,200
I had a good time talking to you as well.

1129
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,080
You are pretty knowledgeable about
fashion.

1130
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,520
Yes, I am.

1131
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,400
I was just kinda hoping I’ll
get to know you better tonight.

1132
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,600
No, thank you.

1133
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,600
You wanted to...

1134
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,160
Well, excuse me, Iet me get some drinks.

1135
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,640
What's going on?

1136
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,280
What do you mean?

1137
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,400
Mum, why is that girl here?

1138
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,360
Her father is here.

1139
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,920
Should I tell him not to
bring his only daughter?

1140
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,160
Mum, come on.

1141
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,120
Look, I...

1142
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,160
I hope you are not planning
anything embarrassing tonight, mum.

1143
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,080
I resent that!

1144
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,360
Do you think I'm stupid?

1145
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,880
No one said you're stupid,
you don’t have to be so dramatic.

1146
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,080
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1147
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,880
I wasn't trying to insult you, okay?

1148
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:02,640
I'm just saying I... hope you've accepted
my decision.

1149
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,000
And I hope you respect it.

1150
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,600
Mum, I'm not marrying that girl.

Here you go.

1155
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,200
-You got me one.
-Yeah.

1156
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,840
Is everything okay?

1157
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,080
Ahh...

1158
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,440
Yea, everything is okay.

1159
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:36,160
Listen, I... I’m not trying to give
you the wrong impression or anything

1160
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,960
and I don't know what my mum has told you.

1161
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,200
Oh my God.

1162
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,840
[Wande] You're so uptight right now

1163
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,000
you need to loosen up, okay?

1164
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,160
Maybe after tonight,
the tension will disappear.

1165
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,000
What's...

1166
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,800
What’s happening after tonight?

1167

[laughs] You're so funny.

1168
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,200
You and I know what's happening tonight.

Am...

1170
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,720
Am I missing something?

1171
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,080
Look at... Sorry, can you hold this
for me?

1172
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,240
-Ohhh
-Hey

1173
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,920
You look amazing.

1174
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,800
That necklace should not be hidden.

1175
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,120
Let people see it.

1176
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,040

-No problem.

What can I say, bro?

Mum, hi.

These are my friends.
This is Charlie, we work together,

Welcome to our home.

[Charlie] Thank you very much, ma'am.

1190
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,320
Ejike has told us so much about you,

1191
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,480
but he failed to mention your sister.

1192
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,480
Yes, her name is Lola.

1193
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,880
This is Lola.

1194
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,040
-I met you.
-Yes Ma.

1195
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,880
At the fashion show?

1196
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,160
you were at the fashion show?

1197
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,080
I was only there for a little while.
Just to pick my mum.

1198
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,600
Oh. Okay.

1199
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,760
Anyway, you should meet my dad.

1200
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,720
You should meet my dad, yes.

1201
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,800
-No.
-Come on.

1202
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,520
You get them a drink, you know,

1203
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:21,360
let your father finish with the Otunba.

1204
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,120
And then we will do the introductions.

1205
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,360
Excuse me.

1206
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,640
How are you?

1207
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,560
-We'll meet him later.
-Hey you,

1208
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,240
introduce me to your friends.

1209
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,560
-Ok, this is Charlie.
-Yes.

1210
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:36,600
-Hey.
-Nice to meet you.

1211
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,400
-Nice to meet you.
-Charlie, this is Wande.

1212
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,480
And Wande, this is Lola.

1213
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,240
Your father is the Honorable Chukwuemeka,

1214
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,880
and you didn't think that was something

1215
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,640
that you should have told me?

1216
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,760
Yeah, look, I'm trying to be me, okay?

1217
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,560
I don't want to walk
around town as Chukwuemeka’s son.

1218
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,040
I don’t like that thing.

1219
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,320
I see.

1220
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,920
Nice to meet you.
Can I speak with you for a minute?

1221
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,080
Yes, sure.

1222
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,360
Well, look at you.

1223
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,160
‪[suspenseful music]‬

1224
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,560
We’re in trouble.

1225
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,760
Ejike gave that girl the necklace,
mum’s necklace

1226
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,920
What girl?

1227
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,840
His friend's sister.

1228
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,680
So?

1229
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,160
Mum said that he should give the necklace

1230
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,480
to the woman he plans to marry.

1231
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,440
We cannot go ahead
with the plans for today,

1232
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:40,240
Or else Ejike will
blow up and ruin everything.

1233
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,680
How can I…?

1234
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,920
Otunba is anxious to make a statement now.

1235
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,880
Stall him, let me think about something.

1236
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,960
[sighs]

1237
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,400
Okay, hurry up, Nneka.

1238
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,840
But I thought you said
you were working on him.

1239
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,160
Yes, well, I am

1240
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,240
I wasn’t expecting this girl.

1241
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,240
Look, I promised to make
you president and I will.

1242
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,440
I mean... we are so close now.

1243
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,960
Nothing is going to stop us.

1244
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,320
-[Charlie] This party seems cool
-Hey

1245
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,920
Yeah, man. Thank you for coming.

1246
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,240
Welcome to my little corner.

1247
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,360
-Hey hey, please.
-Small.

1248
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,520
Hey, please, we are a poor family

1249
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,760
Keep saying that

1250
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,240
At some point, you’ll
believe it. Keep saying that.

1251
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,880
No, no, this is tiny.

1252
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,560
-Kemi.
-[Kemi] Lola and Charlie.

1253
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,760
Cuzzo.

1254
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,600
-How are you?
-Hey.

1255
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,240
What are you guys doing here?

1256
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,200
-Is this the party you were invited to?
-Yes.

1257
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,800
-Wait, this is your uncle's house?
-Yes.

1258
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,720
-So he’s your--
-Ejike, my cousin.

1259
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,800
Keme, Keme.

1260
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,720
[Keme] Right, just one second.

1261
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,280
How are you?

1262
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,080
[Keme] I didn't know you were coming.

1263
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:54,760
Yes, my full name is Ejikeme, Chukwuemeka.

1264
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,080
I'll explain later.

1265
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,880
Ok, you know what?
I don't know what's going on here,

1266
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,840
but... wait a minute.

1267
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,560
So Keme, if you're the only son,

1268
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,600
then who exactly--

1269
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,760
[Keme's dad] Uhhm

1270
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:10,800
Thank you very much, friends and family,

1271
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,120
Thank you so much for
coming to celebrate with me today.

1272
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,560
I thank God for making me to see today.

1273
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:28,040
-I am 60 years old, It’s not a joke.
-[guests clapping]

1274
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,080
-[Keme's dad] My joy is double.
-[guests clapping]

1275
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,520
When I received
a splendid news from my son,

1276
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:40,480
Ejikeme, before this party.

1277
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,800
It is with my utmost pleasure--

1278
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,000
[Keme] Dad, please.

1279
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,920
And joy to announce the engagement

1280
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,800
of my only son, Ejikeme,

1281
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:59,480
-to Wande Ayodeji
-[guests clapping]

1282
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:04,280
the only daughter of
Otunba Ayodeji, thank you.

1283
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,800
Thank you, thank you.

1284
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,600
It's not what you think.

1285
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,720
[Keme] Hold on, hold on, hold on

1286
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,440
let me explain to you

1287
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,240
-Let go, I’m fine,
-It's okay.

1288
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,840
What is going on here?

1289
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:22,360
Mum, not now, please.

1290
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,200
Ejike, don't be rude.

1291
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,920
Otunba wants to
understand what is going on here.

1292
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,840
Mum, that's his problem not mine, okay?

1293
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,880
Can you get this girl out of my house?

1294
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,960
-Lola!
-Let's go, let's go talk

1295
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,920
Lola, oya, come and be going.

1296
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,320
Charlie, go and drop her.

1297
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:42,880
She's... not going anywhere.

1298
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,840
Ok, mum, she’s here on my invitation.

1299
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,680
-So she gets to stay.
-Lola, for the first time in your life,

1300
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,360
don't make this about you.

1301
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,160
Don't come and
cause trouble in this family.

1302
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,640
Lola, we know each other.

1303
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,160
You better leave now before I expose you.

1304
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,320
[Charlie] Expose her?

1305
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,480
This is the girl
you knew since she was a baby.

1306
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,280
[chuckles] You don’t know her!

1307
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,720
I know exactly who she is,
thank you very much.

1308
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,360
You don’t know who she is.

1309
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:15,880
Her M.O is to take other people's men.

1310
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:17,920
How dare you?

1311
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,440
This is all a lie.
What did she do to you that is so bad

1312
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,920
That you’ll say such
hurtful things about her?

1313
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,120
Why not?

1314
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,280
That's how she met
Femi for the first time.

1315
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,720
-Ah.
-Eh, immediately.

1316
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:38,120
Femi started running
after her day and night.

1317
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,360
The most painful
part of this whole thing is

1318
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,320
this girl did not even like the Femi,

1319
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,960
but.. she just decided to ruin
Kemi's life.

1320
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,280
Mum, what has gotten over you?

1321
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,360
Femi was just a horrible guy.

1322
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,520
Stop defending her.

1323
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,080
For once in your life,
hold this girl responsible.

1324
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,080
Hold her responsible
for what she did to you.

1325
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:06,840
Ejike Chukwuemeka, this is
the girl you want to bring into my family?

1326
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,400
This prostitute.

1327
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,080
Ah!

1328
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,280
Mum!

1329
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,520
[iKeme] Lola, wait!

1330
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,040
-Mum, why do you--
-[in Yoruba] Kinni?

1331
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,880
[Keme] Lola, wait, wait.

1332
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,280
Sorry, sorry. Please.

1333
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:26,960
Look, Lola, just let me explain, okay?

1334
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,440
I am sorry about that, you didn't
deserve to go through that.

1335
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,080
[crying]

1336
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,240
Why did you invite me here?

1337
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:37,000
I wanted my parents to meet you.

1338
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,520
Look, I meant it when I…

1339
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,920
Lola, I love you.

1340
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,200
-You lied to me.
-I didn't lie, okay?

1341
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,440
Yes, I omitted the fact
that I am my father’s son, but

1342
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:49,400
-it's not a lie.
-An omission... is still a lie.

1343
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:50,720
I don't know who you are.

1344
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,120
You told me that you are someone else,
I don't know you.

1345
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,080
I'm the same guy you met... The same guy

1346
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,280
What does it matter what my last name is?

1347
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,360
Who are you?

1348
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,720
Please, I don't know who you are.

1349
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,640
Who are you? And who is Wande?

1350
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:02,840
And what does
she have to do with all of this?

1351
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:03,760
Okay, hold up.

1352
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,680
The Wande thing, that's
just my mum being crazy.

1353
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:06,600
I'll explain later,

1354
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:10,160
but... you are the only person
I care about.

1355
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,600
Lola, I'm the same guy.

1356
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,680
Ok, the same guy
that fell in love with you,

1357
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,040
literally seconds after meeting you.

1358
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:26,520
I am the same guy who’s
standing here asking you, begging you.

1359
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,840
Forgive me... Please.

1360
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:33,840
‪[exhales]‬

1361
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,680
I need some... space.

1362
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,560
Look, I need to understand
what's going on,

1363
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,480
I don’t understand, I'm confused.

1364
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,280
Look, I need some space, please.

I'll give you space.

01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,040
But I meant it when I said I loved you.

1369
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,040
So, don't expect too much space.

1370
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,120
I’m gonna go get Charlie to take you home.

1371
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,480
I'm never giving up on us, Lola.

1372
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,280

1373

What is the meaning of this,
Ejikeme or Keme,

1377
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,400
or whatever your name actually is?

1378
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,760
Bro, it's still me, okay?
I wasn’t trying to lie to anyone.

1379
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,120
It's just that I don't like
announcing he's my father, that's all.

1380
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,240
I was trying to distance myself
from my parents' name, that's it.

1381
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,600
That’s all well and good but

1382
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:51,160
all I care about right now, is my sister.

1383
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,120
You told me you loved her.

1384
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:57,240
Are you serious?
I mean that more than you’ll ever know.

1385
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,760
And I do intend to marry her.

1386
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:00,960
So why then are your parents announcing

1387
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,040
your engagement to this person?

1388
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:02,960
Who is she?

1389
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:05,040
And what's going on here, Keme?

1390
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,840
I have no idea what
happened back there, okay?

1391
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,360
I was completely blindsided.

1392
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,640
[sucks teeth] This is like the…
what… second time I’m meeting that girl.

1393

I don't even know her like that.

1394
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:13,920
I'm not going to marry her.

1395
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,080
Well, Kemi says that the whole
family has known about this for months.

1396
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:18,840
Why would your own family do this to you?

1397
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,160
Yes, my family is crazy. Okay?

1398
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,480
I don’t know how else to explain it, okay?

1399
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,680
Otunba Ayodeji has asked
my father to be his running mate,

1400
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,680
four years down the line,
which I thought would be crazy.

1401
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:36,680
But hey, my parents
want to lock down the position,

1402
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:39,200
so they want me to
marry his only daughter,

1403
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,840
which makes no sense.

1404
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,400
But that’s just how they think, okay?

1405
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,480
They told me about it,
I said: "No'' obviously.

1406
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:48,200
but they didn't listen, so here we are.

1407
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,960
Trust me, I had no
idea that was gonna happen.

1408
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,120
I promise you.

1409
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:53,760
They must not have heard me

1410
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:58,560
or they just didn't care
because... now, there’s this.

1411
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:02,000
Keme, this is a nightmare,

1412
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:05,240
and my sister is
caught in the middle of it,

1413
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,400
fix it.

1414
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,560
I know, okay. And bro, I promise you,

1415
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:16,400
I'll sort all of this, okay?

1416
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,400

you are accomplished,
you are really beautiful.

1429

You don't need anyone
to set up a marriage for you.

This is what I’m groomed for, okay?

Errr, fair enough.

1435
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,920
Do you really think I'm beautiful?

1436
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,360
[chuckles] Wande, I think you are a
lovely person,

1437
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,240
I actually mean that.
You are really beautiful,

1438

but... I fell in love with
someone already, okay?

we could be good together.

what to believe anymore.

1539
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,120
Believe me.

1540
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,000
Alright, just say, "You will marry me."

1541
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,840
Your parents won't even accept me.

1542
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,240
I don’t care!

1543
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,160
Honestly, I don’t.

1544
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,840
Look, Lola, I love you. Alright.

1545
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,360
And I know that you love me too.

1546
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,880
You’re still wearing my necklace.

1547
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,040
I do love you,

1548
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,840
But is that even enough?

1549
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,480
What is the point of marrying someone
that you can’t even build a future with

1550
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,160
because the families won’t even accept it?

1551
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,720
It's going to have to be enough.

1552
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,240
Okay? Because I'm not going to stop.

1553
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,440
I'm not stopping until you are my wife.

1554
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:27,960
when I came to Nigeria,

1555
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,360
I came to look for
businesses to invest in.

1556
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,040
I didn’t come looking for a wife.

1557
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,400
Obviously, God had other plans

1558
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,320
because he led me to you and...

1559
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:45,680
Look, Lola, God makes everything;
everything beautiful,

1560
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,000
-In his own time.
-[calm music]

1561
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,600

-You hear me?
-Yes sir.

1568
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,920
And then I don't want to
see you inside here, okay?

1569
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,080
Yes sir.

1570
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,920
No, inside there

Hey, uncle. [human sound]

1575
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:51,480
How’ve you been?

1576
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,760
[Charlie's mum] Hello, Darling.

1577
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:53,920
How are you?

1578
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,320
Good to see you, thank you.

1579
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:59,000
-Hey you!
-How are you doing?

1580
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,480
-Hi, Auntie.
-Hello Darling.

1581
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,400
-How are you?
-I've missed you so much.

1582
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,360
-You are so pretty.
-Thank you.

1583
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,480
Uhm, where's Lola?

1584
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:08,880
I have so much to tell her.

1585
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:14,120
Uhm, Lola is... nowhere to be found
right now.

1586
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,960
[chuckles] What do you mean, she’s nowhere
to be found? Did she go out?

1587
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,440
Teni, Lola is missing.
Ok? We have no idea where she is.

1588
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,640
[sobs]

1589
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,600
How, how?

1590
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,080
People don't just get missing like that.

1591
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:30,320
Has anyone contacted the police?

1592
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,560
Yes, Josh. We have but
there are no leads at the moment.

1593
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,600
God is our lead.

1594
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:38,360
He’ll bring my daughter back home,
where she belongs.

1595
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,600
We just have to have faith, right?

1596
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:44,880
Apparently she left a note with
Keme saying that she was leaving

1597
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,160
and that no one
should come looking for her.

1598
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:48,560
So that means she's alive, right?

1599
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,080
[Teni] Yes?

1600
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,760
We are very sure
that she didn’t write that note.

1601
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,280
And Lola wouldn't just leave.

1602
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,120
Also, there were so
many typos in the message.

1603
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:03,840
Has there been any ransom
message or any ransom demand?

1604
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:08,080
No. There is no other communication.

1605
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,760
-I don’t understand it.
-[mum sobs]

1606
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,840
-Who has my daughter?
-[mum sobs]

1607
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,080
And... what do they want to do with her?

1608
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,120
How is Keme handling this?

1609
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,400
Don’t you dare say that name
in this house.

1610
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,440
D'you understand me?

1611
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,120
Especially with what his mother

1612
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,000
and himself put my daughter through

1613
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,520
Mum, come on,
you know it's not Keme's fault.

1614
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,480
He's devastated about all of this
as we are.

1615
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,240
-Oh, please!
-I don't care what his feelings are!

1616
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:40,120
The whole problem started
the day he laid his eyes on her.

1617
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:42,800
Ugghh

1618
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,840
I told you, I have no
trust in these politicians at all.

1619
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,480

-Bros.
-What's the plan? What's going on?

1641
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,360
They have her in the room at the back.

1642
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,080
They asked me not to enter the room,

1643
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,720
but when I was doing my rounds,

1644
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:11,960
I saw that a window was open.

1645
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,640
So I peeped and I saw
auntie Lola lying on the floor.

1646
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:17,600
How do you know it's Lola?

1647
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:20,720
Bros, I know auntie Lola anyday, anytime.

1648
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,800
She has been so good to me and my family.

1649
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,320
Immediately I saw her,
I called Auntie Kemi,

1650
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,440
and she said she will inform bros.

1651
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,400
Okay, we're just gonna have to go.

1652
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:31,760
-Yes.
-And see what we can do.

1653
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:33,600
How many people are in there?

1654
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:35,360
Bros, there are three of them.

1655
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,880
But Dele is their leader.

1656
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,440
-Dele?
-Yes, bros, Dele.

Now Charlie, tell me

1694

Where did you find her?

1695
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,360
Well, It appears Keme’s
mum had Lola kidnapped

1696
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,080
to keep her away from
him until after his wedding

1697
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:50,680
to Otunba Ayodeji's daughter.

1698

-What?
-She did what?

1699
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,560
Why are these people like this?

1700
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:58,760
Of course she did this

1701
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,960
in conjuction with your friend,
Sisi Toyin.

1702
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:01,960
What?

1703
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,120
She fed Keme's mum
the how and where to find Lola.

1704
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,760
Well, she met her match.

1705
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,400
And she did this to the wrong woman.

1706
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,200
-She will pay for this, honey.
-[Teni] Aunty.

No, and that Keme's mother,

1708
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:15,040
oh she will pay for everything.

1709
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,480
They’re gonna pay for
everything they did to my daughter,

1710
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:20,280
Irrespective of
her husband’s political clout.

1711
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,240
I always knew this.

1712
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,080
I knew that her relationship
with that boy was a wrong one.

1713
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:33,040
See, politicians can do and undo.

1714
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,440
Yes, And they always
believe that they are above the law.

1715
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:39,080
Well, they are not above God’s law, honey.

1716
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:42,320
Why would she do this to Lola? Why?

1717
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,000
[Lola's mum] Honey.

1718
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:46,680
[dad] Lollipop.

1719
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,840
Good to have you back with us.

1720
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,800
Hey, baby.

1721
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:59,840
They beat me…

1722
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,880
[Lola] I was so scared I would never see
you again.

1723
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,920
[mum] Shhhh, don’t say that.

1724
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,840
We will never let anyone hurt you again.

1725
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:12,160
I'm so sorry, baby.

1726
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:14,120
I am so sorry.

1727
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,480
I prayed so hard.

1728
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,120
And then God sent me Charlie and Keme.

1729
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,080
Praise God.

1730
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,280
Why would anyone do this?

1731
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,640
Why?

1732
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,520
Oh honey, I love you.

1733
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,440
I love you too, mom.

1734
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,120
It’s okay.

1735
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:42,480
I’m just grateful
that God brought me back to you.

1736
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,400
So am I.

1737
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:45,960
[groans]

1738
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:48,120
It's okay, don't try to move.

1739
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:52,600
Don't touch it,
don't touch it, Just leave it…

1740
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,480
[Keme's dad] Ah,
here comes the prodigal son.

1741
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:06,000
Look at you, moping around
the house because of a woman,

1742
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:10,760
instead of sealing a simple family deal.

1743
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,200
[mum] You know, I don't even know

1744
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:15,760
how we'll face the disgrace of yesterday.

1745
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:18,240
We were at Otunba's last night,

1746
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,720
discussing the wedding
plans and he was so angry

1747
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:25,280
that you couldn’t even bother to...
show up.

1748
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:31,600
It took all the skills
I possess to pacify him and his daughter.

1749
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:34,200
How could you do that to us?

1750
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:37,520
It will be a wonder if
Otunba speaks to me again.

1751
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,040
[dad] I don't know what got into him,

1752
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:42,080
what possessed him,
he even went as far as telling Wande

1753
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,480
that... he is breaking up with her.

1754
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:46,600
Can you imagine?

1755
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:48,760
[chair squeaks]

1756
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,000
-What is that?
-What is this?

1757
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,240
Look at it

1758
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:55,000
What's it?

1759
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,960
That is the woman that I love.

1760
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,480
The woman that I'm going to marry, right?

1761
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,680
Beaten up, kidnapped,
tortured … Because of you?

1762
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,640
Did...

1763
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:11,840
-Did you ask them to beat her--
-No!

1764
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,800
I didn't ask anybody to beat her.

1765
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:17,200
All i said was
that they should keep her until--

1766
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,600
[Keme groans] Mum!!!

1767
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:23,280
Until I could convince you that she had
asked...

1768
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,400
you to leave her alone.

1769
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,600
I wouldn't ask anybody to beat her.

1770
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,920
-I didn’t--
-What's wrong with you people?

1771
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:35,400
Who does this?

1772
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:42,200
Dad, I'll send every single copy--

1773
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,520
-Wait, wait, wait.
-of these photos.

1774
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,320
Dad, dad, please, please,

1775
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:49,440
These pictures are going out,
okay? Unless you do what I say.

1776
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:54,520
If you don’t, let's see how
your whole vice-presidential ambition,

1777
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:55,520
let's see how far that goes for you.

1778
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,880
You want to ruin me, me, your own father?

1779
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:58,800
Me, ruin you?

1780
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,080
Your own blood?

1781
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:03,360
Dad, you kidnapped someone!

1782
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:05,120
Look!

1783
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:09,280
Mum, dad, her parents
have been worried for days,

1784
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:10,880
wondering where their daughter is.

1785
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:12,000
Not knowing whether she's alive or dead

1786
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:16,240
and I am supposed to be
worried about your... re... reputation.

1787
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,560
your career,
that’s what is important right now?

1788
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,320
What do you want us to do?

1789
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,080
How about we put this
whole marriage charade to an end?

1790
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,960
Can we do that? I am not marrying Wande.

1791
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,280
I need you to
apologize to Lola and her family.

1792
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:34,440
Mum, I'm being serious.

1793
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,840
Ok, and dad, the people who did this,

1794
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:40,760
I need them arrested.

1795
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,000
[mum laughs]

1796
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:46,080
I will never apologize to anyone

1797
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:47,920
for looking after my family.

1798
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:53,560
Ok, let's see how
you will enjoy... jail then.

1799
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:55,920
Hey, hey, hey, stop bluffing there.

1800
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,080
Ejike, now listen, let me tell you.

1801
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:04,520
No security organization
in this country,

1802
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,960
I repeat, in this country,

1803
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:11,400
that will put, my wife and I
in jail! Do you hear me?

1804
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:12,960
Alright, dad.

1805
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:16,040
Let's put that to the test. Shall we?

1806
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:19,320
Since you are the big man. Right?

1807
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,320
Maybe you’re a big man here.
But let's see what happens

1808
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,480
when they face pressure
from the international media.

1809
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,560
Yes, because maybe you guys didn’t know,

1810
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:29,920
but... Lola is a British citizen.

1811
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,320
So let's see what
happens when the news gets

1812
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:35,920
a story about a British
citizen being kidnapped, beaten

1813
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,760
and almost killed in Lagos.

1814
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:41,280
Let's see how that goes,
Maybe that will be a story then.

1815
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,040
What?

1816
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:46,520
-[Ms. Chukwuemeka] Dele.
-Ma.

1817
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,680
What happened to
the girl I asked you to hold?

1818
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:52,800
Err... Uhhm...

1819
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:56,600
Mr... Ejike... came and saved her.

1820
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:59,320
<i>Ehnehn</i>, and I’m
just hearing about it this morning?

1821
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:04,960
I... had no... credit, ma'am.

1822
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:06,080
And then I sent--

1823
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:07,560
Shut up your mouth!

1824
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:11,240
I pay you enough money to make sure
there's enough credit on your phone

1825
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:15,080
How can I ask you to do something
and you just disappointed me?

1826
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:19,160
I didn't... disappoint... you.
I didn’t, Ma.

1827
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,120
It's Mr. Ejikeme, ma

1828
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,200
It was Ejike who came--

1829
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:25,160
If you had done your job,
he would not have found her.

1830
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,040
How did he know where to look?

1831
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:30,480
Ah, eh eh!

1832
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,200
Insider information, I'm sure.

1833
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,480
Oh, that's
your excuse for not doing your job?

1834
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:37,160
Insider information.

1835
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:39,720
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

1836
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:41,000
Who beat her up?

1837
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,760
-Beat her?
-Yes.

1838
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,240
[both] Who beat her up?

1839
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,320
-[Dele] Beat her?
-Yes.

1840
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:48,280
I didn't beat her. It wasn't me.

1841
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:50,520
-You don't know?
-No, sir.

1842
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:54,760
You were asked to watch
and keep an eye on someone

1843
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:56,720
and you’re telling me you don't know who?

1844
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,360
Do you know how serious the issue is?

1845
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:01,840
I know, sir. I didn't beat her.
[in Yoruba] True! No sir.

1846
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,160
-Dele!
-[Dele] Ma.

1847
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:04,320
How often have I told you

1848
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,400
that you must always tell the truth?

1849
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,400
I’m speaking the truth.

1850
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,080
Ok, let me tell you exactly what happened.

1851
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:13,480
I had running stomach.

1852
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:15,480
Yes, Ma.

1853
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:18,160
My stomach was making noises.

1854
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:19,520
[Dele] So I ran to the toilet

1855
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,400
and before I came back,

1856
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:22,760
the girl had vanished.

1857
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:27,160
It's... my stomach, ma'am.

1858
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:28,160
You know what?

1859
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:32,320
Deal with them,
ask Kunle to handle this issue.

1860
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,520
I have to clean up all
this before It gets to the press.

1861
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,920
-Please, sir
-I'm off to see Otunba

1862
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,400
to tell him our own version

1863
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,640
of the story before
he hears it from somebody

1864
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:41,800
-Do you hear me?
-Good idea.

1865
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:42,880
Deal with them

1866
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,000
-No, as for you
-It's...

1867
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,960
-you've lost your job.
-It's running stomach--

1868
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,080
-No, ma, it's not me.
-And you,

1869
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:51,240
I'm going to lock you up.
I will lock you up.

1870
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,800
How could you have
let that happen to that girl?

1871
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:57,120
I said, "Hold a girl,"
and you end up beating her

1872
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,600
until she is totally unrecognizable.

1873
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:01,080
[Lola's mum] Where is she?

1874
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:02,600
Where is the spineless coward

1875
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:04,640
who had thugs beat my daughter?

1876
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,880
-You?
-Who is this woman?

1877
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,400
-Dele, get rid of her.
-Ma?

1878
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:13,640
-Out!
-If you touch me,

1879
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:16,240
I will tear you to pieces this morning.

1880
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,240
You dare hide behind your thugs?

1881
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,560
Face me!

1882
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,120
Face me like a woman!

1883
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:25,040
So I can show you what it is
when cowards think they are above the law.

1884
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:29,240
Madam, leave my
house before I get the police

1885
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:33,000
to lock you up for trespassing.

1886
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:34,080
The police?

1887
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:37,280
After what you did to my daughter?

1888
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,240
Lock me up?

1889
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,680
You dare touch me one more time,

1890
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,880
and I will show you why
they say that Nneka Chukwuemeka

1891
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:47,560
is worth more than ten men. Your daughter
had bitten off more than she can chew

1892
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:48,520
How dare you?

1893
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:49,680
-Aunty, let's go.
-[Ms. Chukwuemeka] Rubbish

1894
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:51,440
I'm begging you.

1895
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:52,880
Ok guys take her inside.

1896
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,640
What kind of a mother are you?

1897
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:00,560
You would rather see your son unhappy

1898
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:03,160
because of your political goals?

1899
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:05,960
You don't know what you're talking about.
Get out of my house!

1900
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,440
Take her inside. Stop! Take her inside!

1901
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,440
What kind of woman is this?

1902
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,000
I know I know, please, alright?

1903
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,440
Oh my God.

1904
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:14,560
Take her inside.

1905
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:15,760
Get out!

1906
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,760
Ah, get out!

1907
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,720
[in Yoruba] Are you deaf?

1908
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,680
[in yoruba] She asked you to leave

1909
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:30,840
Ah, madam!

1910
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,840
[sighs]

1911
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,000
Let me see.

1912
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:58,600
Congratulations.

1913
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,600
I hope you are at
least happy with yourself.

1914
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:04,440
Uhmm, I...

1915
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,920
I can’t even recognize the person
seated in front of me right now, honestly.

1916
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,240
Ejike, please.

1917
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,720
Don’t look at me like that,
I am not a monster.

1918
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:21,720
I’m doing the best I can for my husband.

1919
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:27,040
Look, I didn't mean to hurt Lola.

1920
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,200
Things just got out of hand.

1921
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,520
Yes, but mum, but I kept telling you

1922
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,360
I kept telling you I did
not want to marry Wande

1923
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:36,920
it wasn’t complicated.
Why wouldn’t you just listen?

1924
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:43,640
Mum, I love you, okay?
Always have, always will.

1925
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:46,440
But I can't have
you interfering in my life like this.

1926
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,800
It’s just not gonna work.

1927
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:50,400
I'm sorry.

1928
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:56,000
I won’t interfere anymore.

1929
01:31:58,160 --> 01:31:59,240
Forgive me?

1930
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,360
It’s just one more thing.

1931
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:07,680
I actually need you to go and
apologize to Lola and her family.

1932
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,760
Mum, not one of those
manipulative apologies you give,

1933
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:12,840
when you don’t want people to sue you.

1934
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:16,320
I need a genuine one, okay?

1935
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,560
For me, please.

1936
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,080
I need you to help me make this right.

1937
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:26,560
I need you to help me keep
the woman that I actually love.

1938
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:29,800
Alright.

1939
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:35,280
Well, I'll apologize, I'll grovel,

1940
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:39,480
I'll cry to bring
the smile back in your eyes.

1941
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:42,160
Are we good now?

1942
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,640
There’s just... one more thing.

1943
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:49,480
God, what now?

1944
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:56,400
I need you to promise to rededicate
your life to Jesus.

1945
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:59,280
Ejike, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1946
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,720
My faith in God is just fine,

1947
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:04,000
I am very active in church.

1948
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,840
[laughs] How did
you come up with this ridiculous idea?

1949
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:10,280
Mum, come on.

1950
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:12,880
Let’s be serious here.

1951
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,080
Not even you can
lie to yourself that much.

1952
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:19,280
Surely, you know
that you’ve fallen so far from Him.

1953
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:21,840
I mean, look at what your life has become.

1954
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:24,160
Look at the things
you’re doing with your time.

1955
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:25,840
Look at your face.

1956
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:27,000
Who is this person?

1957
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:30,040
What happened to that... prayer warrior?

1958
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:32,320
You know, the one that raised me…

1959
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,280
Mum, I became a Christian because of you,

1960
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:36,280
You were my role model.

1961
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:39,320
I wanted to be like
you, I wanted to have that relationship

1962
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:42,080
with Christ the way you did.
I wanted to serve,

1963
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:44,680
just because seeing you serve looked so…

1964
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,520
I wanted to be like you.

1965
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:52,040
How did you go from being that person to

1966
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:54,720
whoever this is?

1967
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:55,800
Son.

1968
01:33:58,280 --> 01:33:59,800
Politics is a beast.

1969
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:08,200
You go in there with
high hopes of changing things,

1970
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:12,400
of destroying the endemic corruption

1971
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,520
that has paralyzed our country.

1972
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,840
And before you know it

1973
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:25,080
You’re making deals to
get things on your agenda done.

1974
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:31,280
Very soon you realize that to survive

1975
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:38,400
you have to get rid of your ideals

1976
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:43,800
and jump into the swamp
where it is always dirty

1977
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,640
And just like that.

1978
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:52,760
You become what you have always despised.

1979
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,840
You look at yourself in the mirror

1980
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:04,800
and you don't recognize what you see.

1981
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:12,600
But you console yourself that
you have got things done

1982
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:17,160
And you just need a little bit more power

1983
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:20,040
to get some more things done.

1984
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:24,200
And then you’ll go
back to what you used to be,

1985
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:28,320
but you never go back.

1986
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:36,720
This is what we have become.

1987
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:41,080
[sighs] This is our reality.

1988
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:45,600
This is who we are.

1989
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:49,160
Yes, but mum, it doesn’t have to be.

1990
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,720
It’s not enough to just say: "Oh,
this is what happened,

1991
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,600
and this is who I am now so that's it".

1992
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,440
Jesus will always take you back, always.

1993
01:35:57,520 --> 01:35:59,120
His arms are just wide open,

1994
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:00,480
just waiting for us to come back to him.

1995
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:04,160
Mum look, it's possible.

1996
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,640
You just need to …

1997
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,800
You need to turn
your back on all of these things, okay?

1998
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:12,880
on the world,
on all of these power hungry things

1999
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,720
You’ve gotten yourself into. Just...

2000
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,360
Just give it up, okay?

2001
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:20,040
And come back to him and I promise you,
He will accept you.

2002
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,040
Turn our backs,

2003
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:28,320
turn my back on
everything we have attained?

2004
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:33,520
Go back to who we were?

2005
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:40,160
What does it profit
a man to gain the whole world

2006
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:42,320
and lose his soul.

2007
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:44,280
You taught me that.

2008
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:49,000
That’s from you, mum.

2009
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:52,360
Alright, you can do this.

2010
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:54,480
I need you to believe that.

2011
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,000
You can do this.

2012
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,680
Mum, you've known Lola all her life,

2013
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,760
and you know, she’s an amazing person.

2014
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,880
How could you say
such horrible things about her?

2015
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:10,720
But it's the truth. She destroyed your
relationship with Femi.

2016
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:14,080
Oh mum, spare me! Spare me!

2017
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:16,120
Femi went after her and she said "No" .

2018
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:19,040
If not for Lola, I would have
married that miserable wretch.

2019
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:21,440
You should be thanking
her and not using it against her.

2020
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:23,720
It’s a pattern with Lola.

2021
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,520
She did the same to Bisola.

2022
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:29,120
Must she be the only
one that men must die for?

2023
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:30,600
I'm only looking out for my cousin.

2024
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:32,640
Oh mum, stop, stop, stop.

2025
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,720
Your cousin is capable
of looking out for herself.

2026
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,880
She doesn't need
anybody to look out for her.

2027
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,760
Lola almost got killed.

2028
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:40,320
If not for Ejike and Charlie,

2029
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,480
Only God knows what
would have happened to her.

2030
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,480
<i>Wo</i>, I don’t have a hand in that o!

2031
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:45,840
Oh mum, you did!

2032
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:47,240
You encouraged her!

2033
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:49,600
You told her where and when to find Lola!

2034
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:50,920
You are an accomplice in this!

2035
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,440
You owe Lola and her family an apology!

2036
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,920
You owe them a big apology!

Face me! Don't tell me anything.
