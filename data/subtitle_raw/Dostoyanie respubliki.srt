1
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,195
Daniil? Hey, Daniil? Are there red horses?

2
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,989
When the sun sets on the earth,

3
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,072
it paints everything with its colour.

4
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,792
Then it makes not only horses red,
but people as well.

5
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,989
Our boys are clothed and fed, and what
will you clothe and feed them with?

6
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,638
They'll die of hunger with you.

7
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,991
Can you imagine what kind of a fate awaits them?

8
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,596
Children are our future, Father Nikolai.
It's too late to teach old men.

9
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,831
But we won't allow children to be
sent into some religious stupor.

10
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,672
That's how you see it.

11
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,194
By decision of the Regional Committee,
we will give your children an education.

12
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,793
We will teach them a profession.

13
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,077
If it were my decision,
I wouldn't give you the children.

14
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,230
These are dark times.

15
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,198
Are you afraid to go? Don't be afraid, Inokkenty.

16
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,556
You will see God's world, see the people in it.

17
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,235
You're probably tired of smelling incense?

18
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,711
Your felt boots have holes in them.
- Och!

19
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,238
Never mind, I'll get you new ones.
- And where will you get them?

20
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,794
They say you can find anything in the city.

21
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,194
M-yes!

22
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,273
With whom do I have the honour?

23
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,513
Chairman...

24
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:58,550
Of the People's Republic's Possessions, Kochi.

25
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,277
"Russia was created over centuries,
with sweat and blood...

26
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,878
Wherever we look, everywhere
we see the fruits of the hands of the working class.

27
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,999
The palaces of yesterday
have been returned to their rightful owners,

28
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,675
the victorious-revolutionary masses.

29
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,877
Every ancient monument, every work of art

30
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,272
with which the tsars and the rich
used to amuse themselves, has become ours.

31
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,998
We will not hand them over to anyone.

32
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:52,709
We will not hand them over to anybody,
and will preserve them for our descendants.

33
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,998
For the people who come
after us and want to know...

34
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,833
how and with what people lived before them.

35
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:08,234
The directive Committee of the
Soviet of Workers and Peasants' Deputies.

36
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,832
What's this, who's the lad...?

37
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,351
Intouriccio. If I'm not much mistaken.

38
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,195
It's the famous portrait of a boy
in blue from the Medici collection.

39
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,717
Prince Sergei acquired this
picture on his last trip to Italy

40
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,759
a year before the war.

41
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,673
A forgery?

42
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,832
My son didn't collect copies.

43
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:37,315
Well then, are you going to share
all this out between the proletariat and workers?

44
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,516
There's not enough for everyone, my friend!

45
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,199
- You shouldn't say things like that, old lady.
- Comrade Petrovych

46
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,750
Don't worry, Elena Konstantinovna.

47
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,398
We well understand

48
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,233
what artistic treasures we are dealing with.

49
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,958
Your son's collection will be transferred

50
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,758
intact to the Petrograd State Museum.

51
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,992
By decision of the Soviet of People's Commissars,
signed by Lenin.

52
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,638
His lmperial Majesty, hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

53
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,879
His lmperial Majesty, hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

54
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,032
Hurray! Hurray!

55
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,594
- I'll tear your guts out!
- Hurray! Hurray!

56
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:51,076
It's lucky for you that you're a bird! If you
were a person, I'd give you a good kicking!

57
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,278
Lagutin's bandits! Bandits!

58
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,912
Stop! Stop!

59
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,832
Faster!

60
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,512
Go round her! Go round!

61
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,999
Heads down!

62
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,558
Comrades, run for it, I'll hold them back! I'll hold them!

63
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,754
Alyoshka! Shurka! Where are you going?

64
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,592
Guys, there's a station here, lots of trains!

65
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,399
Who's a counter-revolutionary?
I'm a counter-revolutionary?

66
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,429
I'm telling you, I'm taking the
Tikhvinskis' possessions to Petrograd!

67
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,954
- Hold him, guys,
- Bring him over here!

68
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,837
I'm telling you!

69
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,230
I'm taking the possessions of Prince Tikhvinski...

70
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,197
Which have been confiscated by the revolutionary forces.

71
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,111
Take him to Strunnik, to Strunnik!

72
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,394
Let's go!

73
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,189
I'll give you one, you counter-revolutionary scum!

74
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,919
- We've caught one!
- Who is it?

75
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,676
Here we are, defending the republic,
and this here lackey of some sort of prince...

76
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,993
is taking a load of golden knick-knacks to Petrograd!

77
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,196
- What's going on?
- Defending the rights of the aristocracy!

78
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,508
- Lackey!
- Me?

79
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,192
- You!
- Me?

80
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,712
You!

81
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,473
- I - a sailor of the revolution in the Baltic
- A lackey?

82
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,232
Who are you, then?

83
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,713
Alright! Load his boxes, bring horses!

84
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,632
Let go! Read this!

85
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,998
Listen, sailor, the republic's in danger!

86
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:49,552
I have a stamp from the Soviet of People's
Deputies! Or can't you see?

87
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,108
Or perhaps you're illiterate?

88
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:09,149
"Russia was created over centuries,
with sweat and blood...

89
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:16,070
The palaces and mansions of the princes are now ours!

90
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:25,876
The rarity that I am transporting
in these boxes, art, is also ours!

91
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,788
- Hurray!
- Hurray!

92
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,792
Well sailor, make sure it gets there

93
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,792
Could you tell me, Comrade Director...

94
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,872
the approximate price of this
collection in gold rubles?

95
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,190
I couldn't even give you an approximate estimate.

96
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,158
This collection, built up by the Tikhvinski Princes...

97
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,915
Over almost two centuries, has practically no price.

98
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,433
It is priceless!

99
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:26,677
For instance, number 67... Penturiccio, Boy in Blue.

100
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,672
Come along, come along, come along. Come!

101
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,837
Here's what I'm talking about.
Penturiccio, Boy in Blue.

102
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,438
In 1582, the Duke of Milan paid for it with gold coins...

103
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,035
placed two deep over the
entire surface of the painting.

104
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,556
Penturiccio, Boy in Blue.

105
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,635
Would you be so kind as to open the fifth box.

106
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,069
This one. Only carefully, for God's sake, carefully!

107
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,833
Now you will see this masterpiece... Penturiccio!

108
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,390
This is a mistake! This can't be! It can't be!

109
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,955
Open another!

110
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,790
Open it! Open it! Open it! Quickly and carefully!

111
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,678
Witness statements regarding the case of the
theft of the collection of art treasures...

112
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,196
requisitioned from the former Prince Tikhvinski.

113
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,477
Chairman of the People's Commissariat
for the Possessions of the Republic, Kochin:

114
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,310
I went to the front...

115
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,233
and assigned the sailor Petrovych
to transport the collection to Petrograd.

116
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,356
Sailor Petrovych of the Cruiser 'Onega'.

117
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,796
I packed the boxes with my own hands,
and transported them myself to the museum.

118
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,950
Kuzavlyova, companion of the old Princess.

119
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,315
The princess fell ill, and I did not leave her bedside.

120
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,958
I cannot testify anything in this case.

121
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,871
Former Estate Manager Tarakanov.

122
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,632
I helped pack the collection in the boxes.

123
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,473
From the estate, the collection
was sent intact and preserved.

124
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,232
Carpenter Yegor Dmitrievitch Buketov.

125
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,072
They told me to knock some
boxes together, and I did so.

126
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,549
That's all we know,
we weren't interested after that.

127
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,552
Inspection of the estate
and townhouse of Prince Tikhvinski...

128
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,551
has yielded no results.

129
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,756
The case is closed, it must be assumed...

130
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,355
that the collection has been lost
forever for Soviet Russia!

131
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,990
We will burn all the bourgeoisie in a global fire!

132
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,029
- Fan the flames!
- Hurray! Hurray!

133
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,358
What's this? Let me past! Let me past!
Let me past, I tell you! What is this?

134
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:52,278
Let me past! What are you doing?
What are you doing?

135
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:58,708
Give me that! Give me that!
Give me that, take my life, money, everything!

136
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,156
Thieves! Robbery!

137
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,677
This is a picture from the Tikhvinski collection!

138
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,309
Some hooligans stole it from a passer-by.

139
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,709
We detained them.

140
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,349
It would have been better
if you'd detained the passer-by.

141
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,629
They say he was a weasly type
in dark glasses, wearing a bowler-hat.

142
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:27,478
So the collection's not lost.

143
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,195
I can't even imagine who to assign this case to.

144
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,432
We're talking about priceless works of art...

145
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,193
which could turn out to be abroad.

146
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,840
If you fail to catch a profiteer or two...

147
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,948
it won't be as harmful to Russia
as the loss of these treasures...

148
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,679
belonging to the people.

149
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,069
Who to assign this case to?

150
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,391
I have one new recruit, he's just been demobilised.

151
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,278
Of course, he doesn't have
any experience of our work yet.

152
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,828
But he's conscientious and bright.

153
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,994
He's also looking for works of art just now.

154
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,358
Bronze candlesticks were stolen
from a famous artist.

155
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,512
I'll try assigning him.

156
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,195
Makar Ovchinnikov.

157
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,191
But we have to start...

158
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,718
with a thorough inspection of the
country mansion of this prince.

159
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:34,196
So! You've searched the attic?

160
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,192
Yes, we've looked everywhere.

161
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,271
You've tapped the walls, looked in the cellar?

162
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,510
Yes, I tell you, we looked everywhere.

163
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,910
- I even put guards on the doors.
- You didn't look well enough.

164
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,390
Boxes can't disappear into the ground.
They're here somewhere.

165
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,471
Nothing.

166
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,956
You should interrogate the carpenter, Dmitrich.
He put the boxes together.

167
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,395
Maybe he knows something.

168
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,832
- You Dmitrich isn't here.
- What do you mean, not here?

169
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,876
They killed Dmitrich!

170
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,633
- Ours?
- No

171
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,995
- The Whites?
- No.

172
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,392
- Who?
- Bandits, Lagutin's lot.

173
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,510
Well, have you seen the old woman, the princess?

174
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,072
Your old woman died of typhus last year.

175
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,720
Have you interrogated Tarakanov?

176
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,430
Tarakanov, Tarakanov!
Where will you find Tarakanov now?

177
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,672
False boxes arrive in Petrograd.

178
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,513
And the real collection was taken
from the estate and hidden in another place.

179
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,875
Are you sure it's not at the prince's estate?

180
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,793
Sure! I've searched every corner,
knocked every brick.

181
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,474
They've taken and hidden it so you'll never find it.

182
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,595
Who's hidden it?

183
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,478
The former manager of the
prince's estate, Tarakanov.

184
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,993
- Tarakanov?
- Well, yes.

185
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,913
Because the person who the muggers
stole the picture from...

186
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,718
is Tarakanov, according to their description.

187
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,471
Hi.

188
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,630
I have 13 Tarakanovs here.

189
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,199
If you please!

190
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,908
Right.

191
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,031
Bring him in.

192
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,238
Right, stand up. This one?

193
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,633
I told you, Comrade Boss. It was dark there.

194
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,355
We don't work during the day.

195
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,112
What are you saying? Boss, boss...

196
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,158
The third year of the revolution,
you should be free of this slavish mentality.

197
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,835
Sit. This one?

198
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,910
- Yes.
- Stand!

199
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,911
No. The other was a bit taller.

200
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,629
Wait, wait, you said he was a little weasly type?

201
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,636
You're the boss... you know best.

202
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:41,629
- This one?
- No, the other one
was wearing a cap and glasses.

203
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,349
- You said a hat?
- No, glasses, definitely glasses.

204
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,431
You know best, you're the boss.

205
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,715
What are you going on about. Boss, boss...

206
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:57,030
Right, next. This one? Stand! This one?

207
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,639
- No. It's him.
- Definitely?

208
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,317
- Definitely, it's him!
- What makes you think so?

209
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,231
The other one was also wearing galoshes.

210
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,475
Tsits!

211
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,429
Half of Petrograd wears galoshes,
every second person.

212
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,475
You're the boss, you know best.

213
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,640
That's all, take him away!

214
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,029
Right, Makar, enough playing the goat.

215
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,033
There is a man in Petrograd who can help us.

216
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,909
A renowned criminologist,
and a great art aficionado, to boot.

217
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,037
- You mean Dobrovo?
- Yes.

218
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,551
Prokofiy Filippovitch Dobrovo.

219
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,679
Prokofiy Filippovitch, we really, really beg you.

220
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,638
You beg in vain, Mister Makar.

221
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,233
Firstly!

222
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,314
Using your terminology, I am a police dog.

223
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,155
And to have dealings with you,
a representative of the revolutionary proletariat...

224
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,231
wouldn't be wise.

225
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,912
- Prokofiy Filippovitch!
- There you are.

226
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,468
Excuse me, Prokofiy Filippovitch, 
but for me you are, let me say, ...

227
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,879
Secondly!

228
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,114
Who needs this collection now,
if Russia is going to the Tatars.

229
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,953
- How can you say that.
- And thirdly.

230
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:45,718
You expressed here, in plain words,
that I will receive a ration from you.

231
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,156
Remember this, Mister Ovchinnikov.

232
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,789
Dobrovo is not for sale, not even for a ration.

233
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:01,595
Prokofiy Filippovitch,
you are a renowned specialist in your field.

234
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,478
- You are an experienced detective.
- I am not a detective.

235
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,313
- I am a criminologist.
- That's what I meant.

236
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:13,032
The most respected lawyers
in Russia used to come to this study.

237
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:20,071
I was invited as a consultant to Paris,
Amsterdam, Venice.

238
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,071
- There you go!
- I see.

239
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,153
You mean to say that without
you we won't cope with this case.

240
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,030
Yes, you have experience, knowledge,
that's true. I don't have them.

241
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,834
But I give you my word, Mister Dobrovo.

242
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,236
I will find this collection, I'll find it even if devils took it.

243
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,594
I've received a letter from Paris.

244
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,274
Sergei Sanytch has indicated you as being a person...

245
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,035
who can transport some of his
possessions across the border.

246
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,239
I don't want to get into trouble
with the Soviet authorities.

247
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,198
And what is it that you want
to transport across the cordon?

248
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,034
- Some sculptures, pictures.
- Many?

249
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,069
No, a few boxes. Which will fit into one cart.

250
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,630
And the Bronze Horseman,
you're not going to send that to Paris?

251
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,638
No, we'll leave the Bronze Horseman where it is.

252
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,236
And if I refuse?

253
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:06,029
Don't refuse. You owe too much to the prince.
That's one.

254
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,514
Secondly, you won't be very pleased...

255
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,071
if the Bolshevik's find out that
the flight of the prince and his family...

256
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,711
was organised by you, Mister Shilovski.

257
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,635
No need. There's no need to frighten me,
llya Spiridonovitch.

258
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:34,390
I'm not afraid of anyone,
not you, not God, not the devil.

259
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:11,034
But... I'll help the prince.
I wouldn't like his treasures to be looted.

260
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:17,037
Citizens of Soviet Russia,
the revolution has liberated you.

261
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,556
From the tsar,
the landowners and the capitalists.

262
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,632
I will liberate you from the slavery of things.

263
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,636
What does a worker need with these objects of luxury?

264
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,635
Yesterday these things enriched your lives.

265
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,556
Today they have become stones
around the neck of the working person.

266
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,033
Bring these stones here,
and you will receive millions for them.

267
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:51,435
Oh! This piece of junk was made
in Belgium a hundred years ago.

268
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,195
May I?

269
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,994
What do you need it for?
I will liberate you from it.

270
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,640
- Be careful! I think it's loaded!
- Pardon!

271
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:17,197
Ah! A criminal, I'll show you!

272
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,148
Help me, he's stolen my new nightdress.

273
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,835
- Call the guard!
- Run! Run, I tell you.

274
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,668
- Achmed!
- There's the little imp!

275
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,558
- You won't get away now!
- Why are you feeling sorry for him?

276
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,110
A rotten criminal, box his ears.

277
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,237
Hold him tight, I'll give him a hiding.

278
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,275
Let the boy go.

279
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,032
Let me go, mister,
they're telling you to let me go!

280
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,190
- What do you mean, mister!
- Let me go!

281
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,840
I'll rip your ears off.

282
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:52,119
Let me go, let me go, let me go.

283
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,036
I'll shoot.

284
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,552
Little imp!

285
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,033
I told you it was loaded.

286
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,233
- Who are you?
- Me?

287
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,311
Just call me...

288
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,232
'the Marquis'.

289
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,233
The sword's ring is like the ring of a glass...

290
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,552
The sound has caressed me since childhood...

291
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,838
The sword has shown
a great many what it's all about!

292
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:11,473
Dzing, dzing, dzing - take away the old one...

293
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,475
Dzing, dzing, dzing... bring in a new one!

294
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,038
Come up closer, come up closer...

295
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,634
I'll teach you a thing or two...

296
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,037
I can see right through scoundrels...

297
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,634
When I run them right through.

298
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:35,234
Dzing, dzing, dzing - take away the old one...

299
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,440
Dzing, dzing, dzing... bring in a new one,

300
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,637
In dangerous situations it's as difficult as war...

301
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,235
And maybe someone soon will...

302
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,709
Say the last rites over me!

303
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,148
Dzing, dzing, dzing - take away the old one...

304
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:04,678
Dzing, dzing, dzing... bring in a new one!

305
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,113
- Uncle, do you have any felt boots?
- Felt boots? It's summer.

306
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,237
- Not for me, for Daniil!
- Yes he can have some felt boots.

307
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,237
Young friend, in open battle prepare to defend your honour.

308
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,236
And with a good old-fashioned weapon
take your sweet revenge!

309
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,630
Dzing, dzing, dzing - take away the old one...

310
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,636
Dzing, dzing, dzing... bring in a new one!

311
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,554
Ach, people these days are feeble,
why fight with such as they!

312
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,631
I'd be better testing my strength...

313
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,633
On the devil, damn it all.

314
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,716
Dzing, dzing, dzing - take away the old one...

315
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,635
Dzing, dzing, dzing... bring in a new one!

316
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,714
- Bravo!
- Hello there, llya Spiridonovitch!

317
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,348
- So it seems you've found a boy?
- Yes!

318
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,273
Meet Father Innokentiy!

319
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,514
- Get in!
- I won't!

320
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,318
Get in, I say.

321
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,630
Why do I have to get into a fireplace?

322
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,835
Well?

323
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,918
Find the wheel. No, to the side, to the side.
Found it?

324
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,632
- Found it.
- Turn it to the right.

325
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,789
A safe little place!

326
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,838
The whole house was rifled through,
but they never got in here. Go in!

327
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,831
You, get lost!

328
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,831
What!?

329
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,838
Right.

330
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,635
- There.
- What's that?

331
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,231
Pegasus... the winged horse of inspiration.

332
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,311
And all that's left of the collection
of Prince Tikhvinski.

333
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,039
Stop joking, Shilovski!

334
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,954
- Borzhomski!
- Yakov Nikolayevitch.

335
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,032
I've found you a groom.

336
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,239
Put him in a camisole, make him into an
African and put him on the footboard.

337
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,639
Right away.

338
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,315
Let's go.

339
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,230
Ilya Spiridonovitch, there's nothing
left for us to do in this house.

340
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,669
We're gawking at them shooting a film.

341
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,512
Isn't it a bit risky?

342
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,434
Don't worry, apart from filming,
they're not interested in anything.

343
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:49,434
How he stands, very convincing.
Borzhomski, put a camisole on him.

344
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:55,435
You. You in the bowler, you will open the door.

345
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,477
What right do you have?

346
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,996
Let's give a few instants
of our lives to the great Silents!

347
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,036
He'll be ready in just a second.

348
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,832
Oh my God, what is that!

349
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:18,235
Ready! Start the carriage! Camera!

350
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,831
Thank you everyone for a fine shot!
Shooting is over!

351
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,510
Come here. Come to the film studio tomorrow,
I'm shooting a new film.

352
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,717
'The Rubber Boy'.
You will play the main role, understand?

353
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,438
- Bye.
- Come.

354
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,795
- Here, take this.
- Let's go, step on it!

355
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,638
Please come. Goodbye!

356
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,353
Well, llya Spiridonovitch, c'est tout, I'm free.

357
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,635
No, Shilovski, not so fast.

358
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,077
- But all the leads have disappeared without a trace.
- Not all.

359
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,191
What do you intend to do?

360
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,631
Firstly, we will put your boy...

361
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,631
In the 'Paris Commune' orphanage.

362
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,636
No dawdling, hurry.

363
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,996
- Innokentiy, where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

364
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,230
Don't be late.

365
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,030
Uncle Marquis!

366
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,435
How are you? Hi!

367
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,316
How's things, Father Innokentiy?

368
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,549
Yes?!

369
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:34,438
At twelve on the dot, when everyone's asleep,
go down to the cellar. Here's the key.

370
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,638
Find a trapdoor. Climb down the ladder.

371
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,190
You'll see boxes there. Lots of boxes.

372
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,397
And at the top, under the ceiling, a door.
I'll be waiting behind it.

373
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,153
- Yes.
- Don't forget, twelve on the dot.

374
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,036
Uh-huh.

375
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,439
I'll be waiting.

376
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:01,472
'Amour and Psychia'... a picture from
the collection of the former Prince Tikhvinski.

377
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,792
Extraordinarily characteristic
of the master's painting style.

378
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,192
Notice the bold artistic modelling.

379
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,829
And the warm, rich colours.

380
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,036
And now let us proceed to the next room.

381
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,033
Where you will acquaint yourselves
with the art of the Great French Revolution.

382
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:31,279
Excuse me, if I detain you for a minute.

383
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,392
Are you sure this painting is the right one?

384
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,516
From the Tikhvinski collection?

385
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,832
Undoubtedly!
A whole range of things confirms its authenticity.

386
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,832
- The family coat-of-arms, for instance.
- I see. Excuse me.

387
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,070
Carry on, comrades, carry on!

388
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,631
The Tikhvinski coat-of-arms
is on the other side of the canvas.

389
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,837
Please show me the other side of the canvas.

390
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,840
That's impossible! It can only be done
with the permission of the director.

391
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,637
I'm from Criminal Investigations.

392
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,756
- My God!
- Right!

393
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,795
What are you doing?

394
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,431
Are you sure that this coat-of-arms
is that of the Tikhvinskis?

395
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,236
- Undoubtedly.
- Yeah.

396
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,756
It's high time to throw these pictures in the bin...

397
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,112
It's forbidden to work here at night.
You'll wake the children.

398
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:23,228
The children ran about so much today,
they wouldn't wake up them with a cannon.

399
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,116
And if you drop the bucket? There, you see.

400
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:36,391
Listen, why don't you go to sleep. Go on.

401
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,311
Could you speak a little
more politely with me.

402
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,834
- The children will hear. It sets a bad example.
- Go away.

403
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,113
Go away, dear lady, don't bother me.

404
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,514
- What's your name?
- Anna Sviridovna.

405
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,912
- I see, Nyura.
- Not Nyura, Anyuta.

406
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,833
I see, Nyusha.

407
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,078
Good night, Nyusha!

408
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,194
The monk? What's he doing here?

409
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,471
Who the hell knows?

410
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,240
What? Empty?

411
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,831
Not empty. Look, felt boots.

412
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,111
Felt boots?

413
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,510
Mister, mister! A ghost!

414
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,833
What? Where's a ghost?

415
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,838
In the cellar, the lower one.

416
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:20,631
Ssh! Sh! Enough. Let's go.

417
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,834
So, Father Innokentiy, you won't see me again.

418
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:48,879
Live in your home
'The Paris Commune' and be happy.

419
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,468
- Are you going away?
- No.

420
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,835
I'm just afraid you'll disappear with me.

421
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:59,231
Especially as I don't know
what will happen to me tomorrow.

422
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,313
- Where did you get to, Monk?
- What's it to you?

423
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:17,315
Lanky told us to tell you
to be at the cemetery tomorrow.

424
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,039
- What for?
- We've decided to scram to the Crimea.

425
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,671
Why the Crimea?

426
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,750
Lanky said it was warm there,
with apples. The good life!

427
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,239
- And why the cemetery?
- We need to lay in some grub for the journey.

428
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,640
Lanky says that if you rummage about in the crypts...

429
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,915
you can find a lot of good junk to sell.

430
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,278
- What kind of junk in the cemetery?
- What kind of junk?!

431
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:49,831
They say they only buried counts
and princes in our cemetery.

432
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,354
Very rich graves.

433
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,433
Hard-man, have a look at this! Come here!

434
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,032
Eagles, look!

435
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,113
Over here!

436
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,838
Wow!

437
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,391
Let's go to the fleamarket. Change it for bread.

438
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:50,188
Doughball, look at the picture I found!

439
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,840
Wow! Excellent!

440
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,036
Ya Beauty!

441
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,316
Shall we take it to the fleamarket?

442
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:57,439
A clock? We can take a clock!
They give a lot of bread for clocks.

443
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,837
- A knight!
- No! It's Yegoriy the Conqueror.

444
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:21,868
Unique jewel-encrusted clock,
by a 19th century Swiss master.

445
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:31,358
Claude. Claude Chefois.
Crutch mechanism with month hand.

446
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,956
- Well, it was worth us coming here, Alyona.
...Playing original music.

447
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:40,113
Valued at 7 million.

448
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,795
7 million once!

449
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,638
7 million twice!

450
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,032
7 million thrice! Taken from sale!

451
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,716
Disgraceful!

452
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,478
- Excuse me, madam.
- What is it?

453
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:10,712
- You are the owner of that clock?
- I am. What's the matter?

454
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:16,113
- Madam, the clock is stolen.
- I don't know, I bought it at the market!

455
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,237
Forgive my importunity, madam. From whom?

456
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,716
What, is it yours?

457
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:28,319
No, but I am acquainted with it,
I cannot lie, forty years.

458
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:34,589
Hm. Forty. Forty, forty years ago I wasn't even alive.

459
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:40,471
I bought them at the Haymarket!
From street-urchins! Pardon!

460
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,789
Gravy-boat.

461
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:49,079
Alyona, who now lives at the
former residence of the Tikhvinskis?

462
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,230
It's an orphanage.

463
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:55,233
Valued at 2 million rubles.

464
00:53:56,280 --> 00:54:00,592
The collection was kept in a secret place,
behind the fireplace, in case of danger.

465
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:04,309
Mitrich had to take it to the prince's town-house.

466
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,915
- To that same cellar.
- Yes, but the cellar's empty.

467
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,592
And you must admit, llya Sviridonovitch...

468
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,309
the funeral march does sound a bit symbolic.

469
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,916
When did they kill this Mitrich of yours?

470
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,195
The devil only knows!

471
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:22,832
The last time he came to
Petrograd was to bury the old Princess.

472
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:43,833
Tell me, where did the Tikhvinskis bury their dead?

473
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,197
- I thought bandits had killed you.
- Alive, thank God!

474
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,468
Scoundrel.

475
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,955
Wait for me to catch up, Mitrich!

476
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:13,316
It was terrible on my own!

477
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:18,633
First from the estate to the cellar, and then
from the cellar on my hunched back.

478
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,631
Don't moan, you'll get your cut!

479
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,679
I endured such fear, God forbid!
Luckily no one asked.

480
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,637
And stiffs all around.

481
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,115
You, Monsieur Bouket, are ungrateful to the dead!

482
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,476
They happen to provide you with your daily bread.

483
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:37,038
- Come on, help me.
- Careful.

484
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:40,908
- Got it!
- That's that then.

485
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,753
Careful, gentlemen! Careful, careful!
These are valuable things!

486
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,229
- Gentlemen! Careful!
- Thanks!

487
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,158
Mitrich, you will stay here!
- Don't ruin me!

488
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,708
llya Sviridonovitch, take me with you!

489
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:52,869
You'll stay here...

490
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:55,838
so as not to alarm anyone by your disappearance.

491
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,356
Mitrich, my dear, be patient, for a few days.

492
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,271
I'm afraid, God, I'm afraid.

493
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:05,433
Never mind! You'll catch us up
in the village of Grand Pumps.

494
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,114
Come on, come on, come on!

495
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:09,835
More more, more, more!

496
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,830
Doughball! What's in the sack?

497
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,119
I asked you, what's in the sack?
Have you stolen something again?

498
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:29,316
What have you stolen, do you hear?

499
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,109
We didn't steal it, we bought it, we bought bread.

500
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:38,115
- Bread? What with?
- We flogged a clock.

501
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:43,118
- What, the clock from the second floor?
- No, from the tomb.

502
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,952
- The tomb?
- Oh Lord!

503
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,032
- A big clock, with knights.
- From what tomb?

504
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:51,635
The one with the Prince, general Ansher.

505
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,752
Anshev.

506
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,308
There's a coat-of-arms there, like on our house.

507
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,640
Who has come visiting here recently?

508
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,439
- Apart from boys, no one.
- Absolutely no one?

509
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,636
We live in the cemetery, sir.

510
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,190
So if anyone came visiting,
we wouldn't let them in.

511
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:32,239
You needn't do that, sir.
I've been paid up front for the maintenance.

512
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:36,029
Until March 1925.

513
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:47,156
- What was the cart that came past here?
- That was me, sir, bringing sand.

514
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,231
- Sand?
- Yes.

515
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:54,235
So, sir, if you need anything, we're always here.

516
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:58,389
Ask for Bouket, everyone knows me.

517
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:03,117
- Prokofiy Filippovitch, I've been thinking.
- I've also been thinking!

518
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:07,034
But you and I have been beaten, alas!

519
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,788
Only yesterday, the Tikhvinski collection was here.

520
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:21,039
You see these tracks,
perhaps they will lead you somewhere.

521
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,198
I suggest using diplomatic channels...

522
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,840
for the transfer of the cargo.

523
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,309
We have such a capability.

524
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,635
Diplomatic baggage is not subjected to scrutiny.

525
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:54,512
And will you also send me by
diplomatic post, in an envelope?

526
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,115
- I don't understand you.
- But I understand you perfectly.

527
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:09,829
You will receive money,
lots of money, hard currency!

528
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:15,634
I don't need you hard currency here,
I'll bring the collection myself.

529
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,432
You are putting yourself and a valuable cargo at risk.

530
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:28,158
But I will be sure that I won't be cheated.

531
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,029
- Out the way!
- What's all this?

532
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:45,116
What's all this? Why are you running?
Lads, where are you going?

533
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,838
- To the Crimea
- What for?

534
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,558
It's warm and there are apples.

535
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:54,192
Wait! Lads! Lads! Wait, let's talk!

536
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,630
Where's the governess?

537
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,599
Boys, boys! Please wait!
Boys, where are you going?

538
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,399
Oh, please, please help me!
lbeg you to stop them!

539
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,916
You couldn't even catch that little one,
and there are so many.

540
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:18,433
Goodbye, orphanage!
Spiridonovna, goodbye! Be healthy!

541
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,874
Step on it, brother, follow that tram!

542
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,633
Faster, brother, faster!

543
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,553
I'm not made for this work, I'm not made for it.

544
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,632
I was so kind to them,
and they run away to the Crimea!

545
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,631
It's warm there, there's apples!

546
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:53,433
- Faster!
- Careful!

547
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,633
Go on!

548
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,038
His lmperial Majesty! Hurray!

549
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,596
He'll be the ruin of us! Wring his neck!

550
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,635
One hundred years you've
been saying the same thing.

551
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,228
It's time to think up something new.

552
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:37,320
Say: "Tarakanov... hurray"!

553
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:40,039
- What are you teaching the bird?
- Tarakanov... hurray!

554
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:40,836
Don't worry!

555
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,480
lt'll take him another 200 years to learn your name.

556
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,030
- Tarakanov... hurray! Hurray... Tarakanov!
- Hurray!

557
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,633
Stop it!

558
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:52,759
His lmperial Majesty... hurray! Hurray!

559
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,037
Lord! Such an inhuman voice.

560
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:04,315
Not at all, it's very human.
Counter-revolutionaries sailing by.

561
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:12,592
- His lmperial Majesty... hurray! Hurray! Hurray!
- I should remember the number. 777.

562
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:15,956
Apart from the individuals you have named,
who else was present at the estate?

563
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,952
What are you on at me for? Who-who?

564
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,835
There was a parrot present there as well!

565
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,673
Stop acting the fool! What kind of parrot?

566
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,069
I'm telling you, there was a parrot.

567
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,709
The old dead princess said he was 200 years old.

568
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,473
And I just about gave him a kicking in!

569
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,399
What for?

570
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,438
For putting out monarchic propaganda!

571
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,910
His lmperial Majesty, may he rot...

572
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,515
hurray!! - Shouting like he's at meeting.

573
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,558
- You're not lying, Petrovych?
- My word of honour!

574
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,791
I'll remember that parrot 'til I die.

575
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,599
"His lmperial Majesty", he says, "Hurray!"

576
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:58,116
- Barge 777 is yours?
- Ours, Petrogartopskaya.

577
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,633
- What the hell do you need with it?
- Where is it?

578
01:04:15,522 --> 01:04:24,157
What will be will be, Let fate be the judge.

579
01:04:24,242 --> 01:04:34,436
In this gentle silence, All else is
fuss and noise, as tramp and a fighter...

580
01:04:34,522 --> 01:04:42,395
I've travelled half the world, but I go
down on my knees before my city...

581
01:04:47,322 --> 01:04:53,841
I don't know whether you've heard,
that I sing for the loveliest of ladies...

582
01:04:53,922 --> 01:05:00,077
But I've died of boredom with them...

583
01:05:00,482 --> 01:05:07,832
And this city is my sweetheart,
because I'm never bored with her...

584
01:05:07,922 --> 01:05:14,270
And God forbid, God forbid we
should ever be parted.

585
01:05:17,522 --> 01:05:24,041
I don't know whether you've heard,
that I've roamed from city to city...

586
01:05:24,122 --> 01:05:30,357
And never had refuge or shelter,

587
01:05:30,442 --> 01:05:38,235
But I always returned, as to my home,
to the beauty between the sky and the Neva.

588
01:05:38,322 --> 01:05:45,273
And God forbid, God forbid I ever have other.

589
01:05:47,922 --> 01:05:54,475
I don't know whether you've heard,
That I never complained when in trouble...

590
01:05:54,562 --> 01:06:00,671
But sometimes in my hardest years...

591
01:06:00,762 --> 01:06:08,521
This city looked after me, And to do her harm...

592
01:06:08,602 --> 01:06:12,277
God forbid...

593
01:06:14,402 --> 01:06:20,272
God forbid I ever do so.

594
01:06:35,322 --> 01:06:39,281
Farewell, llya Sviridonovitch! I'm leaving you.

595
01:06:40,362 --> 01:06:42,717
I'm sick of your jokes, Shilovski!

596
01:06:42,802 --> 01:06:46,078
I'm not joking!

597
01:06:49,722 --> 01:06:53,112
I'm staying in Petrograd, I'm out of the game.

598
01:06:55,322 --> 01:07:00,476
What? You promised! You gave your word.

599
01:07:00,562 --> 01:07:04,794
You said you'd transport my
boxes across the border.

600
01:07:04,882 --> 01:07:06,759
- Your boxes?
- Yeah.

601
01:07:06,842 --> 01:07:09,959
- Are they yours?
- Don't try to catch me out, Shilovski.

602
01:07:10,042 --> 01:07:11,521
Hands off!

603
01:07:15,362 --> 01:07:21,312
- You misunderstood me.
- I understood you correctly.

604
01:07:27,482 --> 01:07:31,634
But you've convinced me, I'll stay.

605
01:07:31,722 --> 01:07:37,592
I'll escort your boxes to the Prince.

606
01:07:37,682 --> 01:07:42,710
I really wouldn't like them to stay with you. Let go!

607
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:52,640
You women, dressed in pearls and diamonds,

608
01:07:52,722 --> 01:07:55,839
At the same time as our people struggle and suffer.

609
01:07:55,922 --> 01:07:58,675
Be silent, you madman!

610
01:08:09,122 --> 01:08:13,320
Who painted over the number?

611
01:08:15,682 --> 01:08:18,754
There was a number when
the barge was berthed here.

612
01:08:18,842 --> 01:08:20,958
What was the number?

613
01:08:21,042 --> 01:08:22,760
- Vanka!
- What?

614
01:08:22,842 --> 01:08:24,992
What was the number of the barge?

615
01:08:25,082 --> 01:08:27,437
777! Can't you see for yourself?

616
01:08:27,522 --> 01:08:29,911
There isn't a number, someone's covered it up.

617
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:49,034
Tarakanov... hurray!

618
01:08:51,202 --> 01:08:56,595
Why have you gone quiet? Say something!

619
01:08:56,682 --> 01:08:59,833
- Tarakanov... hurray!
- What?

620
01:08:59,922 --> 01:09:01,833
Tarakanov... hurray!

621
01:09:06,402 --> 01:09:09,041
Hurray Tarakanov. What a good goose.

622
01:09:09,122 --> 01:09:12,319
And it didn't stop anywhere on the way?

623
01:09:12,402 --> 01:09:14,279
Didn't stop anywhere?

624
01:09:14,362 --> 01:09:19,880
Two people boarded in Mikhailovka
at night with a cargo.

625
01:09:22,722 --> 01:09:28,638
- What kind of cargo? What kind of people?
- People, just people, that kind of people.

626
01:09:28,722 --> 01:09:32,681
And the cargo... boxes, ordinary boxes.

627
01:09:32,922 --> 01:09:34,878
See how I'm writing with a stump!

628
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:37,635
You're from Petrograd, why don't you
tell them we've nothing to write with.

629
01:09:37,722 --> 01:09:42,955
Wait, the number of the train is 569, and then what?

630
01:09:43,042 --> 01:09:48,241
Station of destination... Izgorsk, boxes to store 21.

631
01:09:48,322 --> 01:09:49,391
- You see the paper we have...
- I see, I see!

632
01:09:49,482 --> 01:09:50,517
- There's nothing to see...
- Wait, wait!

633
01:09:50,602 --> 01:09:53,070
- What's this?
- You're from Petrograd! You should tell them there!

634
01:09:53,162 --> 01:09:55,073
Oh come on, don't be like that.

635
01:09:55,162 --> 01:09:57,676
- So, what else?
- Boxes!

636
01:09:57,762 --> 01:09:59,639
- Right.
- Boxes all night.

637
01:09:59,722 --> 01:10:00,234
- I see!
- Boxes all night! Just boxes!

638
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:05,635
And here, stations of destination
Kandalaksha and Gdov. What's that?

639
01:10:05,722 --> 01:10:08,361
Boxes!

640
01:10:09,802 --> 01:10:23,239
Inspection of boxes in Kandalaksha
and Gdov yielded no results.

641
01:10:23,322 --> 01:10:25,711
- I didn't get it.
- No results.

642
01:10:25,802 --> 01:10:35,200
Right. I personally permit
you to continue the search.

643
01:10:35,282 --> 01:10:41,630
Leave immediately for lzgorsk.

644
01:11:08,762 --> 01:11:09,956
- Go!
- I'm not going!

645
01:11:10,042 --> 01:11:12,033
- Go!
- I'm not going, I've got weak hands!

646
01:11:12,122 --> 01:11:14,113
- Go, I say!
- I'm not going!

647
01:11:14,202 --> 01:11:16,477
Alright, I'll go!

648
01:11:49,322 --> 01:11:51,790
Guard, thieves!

649
01:11:53,402 --> 01:11:54,471
Come here!

650
01:11:54,562 --> 01:11:58,271
Let me go, mister, let me go! Let me go, I say!

651
01:11:59,082 --> 01:12:00,231
Alright.

652
01:12:06,602 --> 01:12:10,515
- Where are you from?
- From there.

653
01:12:10,602 --> 01:12:13,878
- Outside.
- Alone?

654
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:15,600
Alone.

655
01:12:24,122 --> 01:12:25,794
Smart.

656
01:12:52,642 --> 01:12:56,396
Couldn't you get a lighter sack?

657
01:12:57,322 --> 01:13:00,280
There you go.

658
01:13:04,802 --> 01:13:06,076
Where are you going?

659
01:13:06,162 --> 01:13:08,153
- Crimea.
- What for?

660
01:13:08,242 --> 01:13:11,757
It's warm there, there's apples.

661
01:13:11,842 --> 01:13:17,235
So, you're from Petrograd?

662
01:13:17,322 --> 01:13:22,237
From the 'Paris Commune' Orphanage?

663
01:13:22,322 --> 01:13:25,234
How do you know that, mister?

664
01:13:25,322 --> 01:13:28,553
I know everything,
I've been watching you a long time.

665
01:13:29,642 --> 01:13:32,600
Are you going to take me back to Petrograd?

666
01:13:44,522 --> 01:13:46,990
lzgorsk!

667
01:13:48,642 --> 01:13:52,954
Fire! We're on fire, brothers, we're on fire!

668
01:14:00,042 --> 01:14:02,920
What are you waiting for?
Get buckets, pots, pans, follow me!

669
01:14:03,002 --> 01:14:04,515
Let's get out of here, lads.

670
01:14:04,602 --> 01:14:09,960
Citizens, what are you looking at? The treasures
of the Republic are burning before your eyes!

671
01:14:10,042 --> 01:14:12,351
- Stationmaster!
- What the... what's wrong?

672
01:14:12,442 --> 01:14:13,955
Where's the cargo from Mikhailovka stored?

673
01:14:14,042 --> 01:14:16,556
From Mikhailovka? There, in the third sector.

674
01:14:16,642 --> 01:14:22,638
Right. Comrades! There's sculptures,
paintings, our treasure.

675
01:14:22,722 --> 01:14:26,476
Save them.

676
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:28,996
Bring water, quickly!

677
01:14:47,842 --> 01:14:52,279
Feldsher! Feldsher!

678
01:14:56,322 --> 01:14:59,678
Uncle Makar, Uncle Makar, are you alive?

679
01:15:04,322 --> 01:15:10,511
It's all burnt. The collection is lost.

680
01:15:39,002 --> 01:15:43,439
Alyona, is that face familiar to you?

681
01:15:44,802 --> 01:15:49,398
I think he taught fencing
to Prince Tikhvinski's children.

682
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:57,398
If you would be so kind.
Cut off a few frames for me, please.

683
01:15:57,482 --> 01:16:00,474
This one, this one, and this one.

684
01:16:53,042 --> 01:16:59,356
No, Carl Genrikhovitch, you misunderstood me.

685
01:16:59,442 --> 01:17:02,559
I'm not going to work for you.

686
01:17:02,642 --> 01:17:07,318
I'm too old to start a new life.

687
01:17:07,402 --> 01:17:12,920
It's simply that I don't want Russia...

688
01:17:13,002 --> 01:17:15,914
to lose the unique collection of the Tikhvinskis.

689
01:17:25,562 --> 01:17:28,474
It's lost, Prokofiy Filippovitch, it's been burnt.

690
01:17:28,562 --> 01:17:30,314
Burnt?

691
01:17:30,402 --> 01:17:35,476
In a fire at lzgorsk railway station, burnt to the ground.

692
01:17:35,562 --> 01:17:41,080
- The evidence has been confirmed?
- Absolutely.

693
01:17:41,162 --> 01:17:43,756
The warehouse burnt down, and everything in it.

694
01:18:03,322 --> 01:18:08,794
- Hi.
- Still climbing through windows?

695
01:18:09,962 --> 01:18:14,592
- They won't let me in the door.
- Where did you get that?

696
01:18:18,122 --> 01:18:21,876
I won't eat stolen goods.

697
01:18:27,242 --> 01:18:31,121
- Did you give me money?
- I don't need anything.

698
01:18:31,202 --> 01:18:33,841
If you don't eat, you'll fade away.

699
01:18:35,802 --> 01:18:42,878
- What did you do with my felt boots?
- Your felt boots are in the nurses cupboard.

700
01:18:42,962 --> 01:18:53,156
- Are you really going to be a thief when you grow up?
- No, I'm going to be an icon painter.

701
01:18:53,682 --> 01:18:58,233
- An icon painter.
- Yes, like Cross-eyed Daniil.

702
01:18:58,322 --> 01:19:01,473
How many times do you have
to be told, God doesn't exist.

703
01:19:01,642 --> 01:19:04,839
Yes, I've heard, but icons exist.

704
01:19:07,402 --> 01:19:11,839
They gave Daniil Cross-eyed
a sack of potatoes for one icon.

705
01:19:11,922 --> 01:19:17,155
- Eat a potato, go on.
- Thanks.

706
01:19:26,242 --> 01:19:32,795
Uncle Makar, look outside, it's good.

707
01:19:49,122 --> 01:19:53,434
Yes, beautiful! There's something to go back to.

708
01:19:55,322 --> 01:19:58,280
We'll put an end to all the bad things...

709
01:19:58,362 --> 01:20:02,594
and we'll build such things here, you can't imagine.

710
01:20:03,322 --> 01:20:05,199
I can, Uncle Makar.

711
01:20:31,322 --> 01:20:35,554
We need to build factories,
Innokentiy, and power-stations.

712
01:20:37,322 --> 01:20:39,631
And we'll all ride on horses.

713
01:20:39,722 --> 01:20:47,072
No, in airplanes, and steeds,
singing revolutionary songs.

714
01:21:28,482 --> 01:21:33,476
Try some, try some. Get lost, you!
Oh, you little thief.

715
01:21:43,322 --> 01:21:46,519
You little devil. Grab him!

716
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:49,992
- Get him, get him!
- Thief!

717
01:22:33,722 --> 01:22:36,475
- Get a bit of your apple?
- Let me go, mister!

718
01:22:39,682 --> 01:22:41,354
Uncle Marquis!

719
01:22:43,202 --> 01:22:44,874
Hi!

720
01:22:46,402 --> 01:22:49,599
- You recognise me, Father Innokentiy?
- Uh-huh.

721
01:23:17,402 --> 01:23:20,872
Where are you heading? From Vologda to Kerch?

722
01:23:22,202 --> 01:23:26,480
- No, Crimea.
- I see.

723
01:23:26,922 --> 01:23:30,631
- And what haven't you seen there?
- Tit's warm there, there's apples.

724
01:23:31,162 --> 01:23:32,675
Thanks.

725
01:23:35,122 --> 01:23:39,479
You're not going to Crimea, you're coming with me.

726
01:23:41,402 --> 01:23:46,556
- No, I'm not going to look for boxes.
- What boxes, there aren't any boxes.

727
01:23:46,642 --> 01:23:48,473
They were burnt.

728
01:23:49,122 --> 01:23:52,273
See that hut, that's where they burnt.

729
01:24:15,442 --> 01:24:19,515
The collection wasn't in
the warehouse at the time.

730
01:24:20,322 --> 01:24:25,680
But at the time of the fire, in so to speak,
a moment of emotion...

731
01:24:25,762 --> 01:24:28,481
you may not have understood that.

732
01:24:29,322 --> 01:24:33,076
If it had burnt in the warehouse, then...

733
01:24:33,162 --> 01:24:38,475
Firstly, there would have
been some porcelain, marble objects.

734
01:24:38,562 --> 01:24:40,678
So...
Yes.

735
01:24:40,922 --> 01:24:43,072
Yes.

736
01:24:43,162 --> 01:24:45,676
Of course.
Secondly,

737
01:24:45,762 --> 01:24:49,675
The bronze figure of Voltaire couldn't have burnt.

738
01:24:49,762 --> 01:24:51,593
Yes, the work of the French sculptor Goudon.

739
01:24:51,682 --> 01:24:52,831
A smaller version.

740
01:24:52,922 --> 01:24:55,277
Oh, it appears you are a fine art scholar.

741
01:24:55,362 --> 01:24:59,275
No, I just learned the
collection catalogue off by heart.

742
01:24:59,362 --> 01:25:02,354
This work is listed as number 129 in it.

743
01:25:02,442 --> 01:25:07,277
So, number 129 couldn't burn.

744
01:25:07,362 --> 01:25:09,876
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

745
01:25:10,122 --> 01:25:17,676
So just the warehouse burnt down.
They covered their tracks, the swine.

746
01:25:17,762 --> 01:25:22,438
Well, we don't know that.
Perhaps they were just lucky.

747
01:25:22,522 --> 01:25:26,276
And the warehouse really
was burnt down by Lagutin's gang.

748
01:25:26,802 --> 01:25:28,440
What will we do now?

749
01:25:29,442 --> 01:25:34,391
First of all, if your doctors permit...

750
01:25:34,482 --> 01:25:36,074
They will...

751
01:25:36,162 --> 01:25:42,078
This evening you will go to the
final performance of the circus.

752
01:25:42,162 --> 01:25:45,472
I will keep you company.

753
01:25:52,922 --> 01:25:59,839
Revolutionary pantomime.
The liberation of labour.

754
01:27:32,082 --> 01:27:36,121
The red flag is flying, many songs and flowers,

755
01:27:36,202 --> 01:27:41,037
The eyes of the sons of the
Republic are shining with joy.

756
01:27:48,722 --> 01:27:54,479
The enigmatic mysteries of the East. Ali-bat.

757
01:29:15,402 --> 01:29:16,676
Well? Ready!

758
01:29:28,202 --> 01:29:32,673
The one-armed William Tell!

759
01:29:34,082 --> 01:29:36,960
A death-defying act!

760
01:29:37,762 --> 01:29:44,873
The management asks people with
a nervous disposition to leave the circus.

761
01:30:37,882 --> 01:30:39,873
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy!

762
01:31:07,442 --> 01:31:12,675
What a guy! William, yeah? Give us a shot.

763
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:33,720
Granny, give me a blindfold.
Tie it, tie it, you'll get your

764
01:31:33,802 --> 01:31:35,918
Scarf back.

765
01:32:04,762 --> 01:32:11,713
Alright, let's say I go with you.
What part do I get to play?

766
01:32:13,082 --> 01:32:16,358
Part? Will we take him?

767
01:32:18,042 --> 01:32:21,512
Like today, you come out of the
audience in your own clothes.

768
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:23,638
- Why, why?
- What, then?

769
01:32:23,722 --> 01:32:26,680
Alright, do you want to wear
a sailor's outfit for effect?

770
01:32:28,842 --> 01:32:30,753
Alright, I agree.

771
01:32:43,722 --> 01:32:45,678
Makar has gone off with the circus.

772
01:32:47,762 --> 01:32:49,673
It's a dangerous situation, especially if we consider

773
01:32:49,762 --> 01:32:53,152
that Lagutin's gang is armed.

774
01:32:56,042 --> 01:32:58,351
Where's the circus headed?

775
01:32:58,442 --> 01:33:00,672
I'll make inquiries.

776
01:33:18,802 --> 01:33:21,874
So, if the circus is headed for the border,
then it can be assumed

777
01:33:21,962 --> 01:33:23,759
that the collection is going with it.

778
01:33:24,322 --> 01:33:28,031
Bulatov, leave for lgorsk tonight.

779
01:33:28,122 --> 01:33:30,920
- Contact the military there.
- Yes, sir.

780
01:33:31,002 --> 01:33:34,517
- Follow Makar.
- Yeah. I will.

781
01:33:54,202 --> 01:34:01,233
Tarakanov locks his caravan very securely.

782
01:34:01,322 --> 01:34:04,280
What's he got there? What's he hiding?

783
01:34:05,722 --> 01:34:10,477
- What's he got? The money.
- Money. He gave out the money yesterday.

784
01:34:12,482 --> 01:34:14,677
How come you notice everything, Makar?

785
01:34:34,962 --> 01:34:37,351
I'll catch up with you in the village of 'Big Pumps'.

786
01:34:37,442 --> 01:34:40,673
As we agreed with Mitich, he'll hide you until I arrive.

787
01:34:40,802 --> 01:34:42,599
But don't you think about talking him...

788
01:34:42,682 --> 01:34:44,479
into crossing the border without me.

789
01:34:44,562 --> 01:34:48,157
- You still don't trust me, Shilovski.
- Come on, llya Spiridonovitch.

790
01:34:48,242 --> 01:34:51,552
Until you can do without me, I trust you implicitly.

791
01:34:52,402 --> 01:34:57,078
Leave the boy, your assistant.

792
01:34:57,162 --> 01:34:59,517
No, no, I'm not leaving Innokentiy.

793
01:34:59,602 --> 01:35:01,274
You take him with you.

794
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:03,830
I don't understand, what the
hell do you need with that puppy?

795
01:35:03,922 --> 01:35:05,753
I love him.

796
01:35:06,722 --> 01:35:08,872
You wouldn't understand that, Tarakanov.

797
01:35:10,922 --> 01:35:14,471
- You're nervous?
- I'm cool as a cucumber.

798
01:35:14,562 --> 01:35:16,359
So I see.

799
01:35:33,322 --> 01:35:37,281
Makar, your proletarian instinct hasn't misled you.

800
01:35:37,362 --> 01:35:39,432
Tarakanov really is a swindler.

801
01:35:39,522 --> 01:35:41,240
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

802
01:35:41,722 --> 01:35:44,680
- You know what he's hiding?
- What?

803
01:35:46,082 --> 01:35:47,674
Sunflower seeds.

804
01:35:48,562 --> 01:35:50,598
- Sunflower seeds?
- Yeah.

805
01:35:53,362 --> 01:35:55,114
Ten sacks of sunflower seeds.

806
01:35:55,202 --> 01:35:57,477
- Ten sacks?
- Yup.

807
01:35:57,562 --> 01:35:59,678
That's a lot.

808
01:36:05,202 --> 01:36:08,239
But I don't see Tarakanov's caravan.

809
01:36:11,082 --> 01:36:13,801
What's the matter, Makar?

810
01:36:15,802 --> 01:36:17,520
Wait.

811
01:36:24,322 --> 01:36:27,075
I don't want to! What are you doing,
llya Spiridonovitch!

812
01:36:27,162 --> 01:36:31,360
I don't want to, let me go,
llya Spiridonovitch, I'll tell Makar!

813
01:36:31,442 --> 01:36:37,074
Let me go, llya Spiridonovitch,
I don't want to, let me go I say!

814
01:36:37,162 --> 01:36:41,440
Let me go llya Spiridonovitch,
let me go, I don't want to.

815
01:36:41,522 --> 01:36:48,280
Let me go I say! Let me go,
llya Spiridonovitch! I'll tell Makar!

816
01:36:48,522 --> 01:36:54,518
- What's the matter, Makar?
- I've decided to water the horses.

817
01:36:56,442 --> 01:36:58,876
You can't water the horses in the road.

818
01:36:59,922 --> 01:37:04,234
Be a good fellow, keep going.

819
01:37:04,722 --> 01:37:08,078
Drop your weapon.

820
01:37:13,922 --> 01:37:18,313
You're right, I'm too good a shot.

821
01:37:42,522 --> 01:37:43,716
Go away.

822
01:38:07,322 --> 01:38:10,917
Stop.

823
01:38:14,402 --> 01:38:15,357
Stop!

824
01:39:31,122 --> 01:39:35,354
Uncle Makar, Uncle Makar, I'm here.
Uncle Makar, I'm in the caravan.

825
01:39:35,442 --> 01:39:37,956
I'm in the caravan, quickly.

826
01:39:38,482 --> 01:39:41,679
Stop, Tarakanov, stop, or I'll shoot!

827
01:40:04,522 --> 01:40:06,160
Stop, or I'll shoot!

828
01:40:06,242 --> 01:40:09,234
Uncle Makar, my leg's stuck, my leg's stuck.

829
01:40:11,882 --> 01:40:15,477
- My leg's stuck, Uncle Makar!
- Hold on.

830
01:40:17,682 --> 01:40:19,479
You're alive!

831
01:40:46,682 --> 01:40:48,718
Beautiful!

832
01:40:53,602 --> 01:40:55,957
- You like it?
- Uh-huh.

833
01:41:05,802 --> 01:41:11,479
This is number 67, Pinturiccio, 'Boy in Blue'.

834
01:41:13,522 --> 01:41:16,275
He must be 500 years old, but it's as if he's alive.

835
01:41:25,682 --> 01:41:29,118
Don't worry, gentlemen, you're coming with us.

836
01:41:30,042 --> 01:41:34,433
- Trofimitch, let's ride! We're off!
- Get down.

837
01:41:37,042 --> 01:41:38,270
Hide!

838
01:41:52,322 --> 01:41:57,760
Let's go! Come on, come on, faster!
Take it to the Ataman, to Lagutin.

839
01:42:04,122 --> 01:42:11,756
7, 74, 35.

840
01:42:12,402 --> 01:42:15,633
Where, my good man, did you steal such treasures?

841
01:42:16,082 --> 01:42:19,916
I didn't steal them.
They're treasures of the Republic.

842
01:42:20,042 --> 01:42:28,154
69, 9, 77. What Republic would that be, hm?

843
01:42:29,362 --> 01:42:33,799
The Soviet Republic of Workers and Peasants.

844
01:42:33,882 --> 01:42:37,875
21, 15,

845
01:42:44,642 --> 01:42:48,920
48, 31.

846
01:42:49,682 --> 01:42:52,674
- You're a commissar?
- No.

847
01:42:53,642 --> 01:42:54,870
A Bolshevik?

848
01:42:57,402 --> 01:42:58,437
Uh-huh.

849
01:42:58,522 --> 01:43:00,752
- Scum!
- 22!

850
01:43:05,162 --> 01:43:09,952
59, 37...

851
01:43:11,722 --> 01:43:16,273
5. Gentlemen... House!

852
01:43:26,922 --> 01:43:30,835
Do you want to live?

853
01:43:36,722 --> 01:43:40,397
Can you imagine, I don't.

854
01:43:45,242 --> 01:43:46,755
I'm fed up.

855
01:43:48,322 --> 01:43:51,075
I'm bored.

856
01:43:53,642 --> 01:43:56,520
But what injustice there is in the world.

857
01:44:00,002 --> 01:44:08,239
You want to live, but you won't.

858
01:44:08,322 --> 01:44:11,632
And I don't want to, but I will.

859
01:44:19,562 --> 01:44:25,432
I will strike you off the list of the living in this world...

860
01:44:25,522 --> 01:44:28,116
As a member of the Communist Party.

861
01:44:54,602 --> 01:45:01,075
You're lucky. I'll give you another 24 hours.

862
01:45:03,802 --> 01:45:05,679
Take him to the church.

863
01:45:07,842 --> 01:45:11,357
He'll have time to ponder his immortal soul there.

864
01:45:31,522 --> 01:45:37,358
I answered her: "madam, what
is left you can have, don't be picky.

865
01:45:37,442 --> 01:45:41,799
Arms and legs, as I said, all that's
left is my head, and that's tricky.

866
01:46:15,482 --> 01:46:19,600
Luli-luli, oli-boli, without my
one and only, willy-nilly'.

867
01:46:21,322 --> 01:46:22,755
I'll lie down here at last,
and tell you of my past, it's just silly.

868
01:47:15,322 --> 01:47:21,272
- Close the gates!
- Hold him.

869
01:47:53,042 --> 01:47:57,001
Get out of here fast, scumbag,
quickly, before they kill you.

870
01:48:02,322 --> 01:48:05,553
Ballerina, semolina, oh it's such a shame,

871
01:48:05,642 --> 01:48:09,476
Katerina or Marina,
I've forgotten my wife's name.

872
01:48:09,562 --> 01:48:12,838
She said, he's vertically disabled

873
01:48:12,922 --> 01:48:16,881
- But just one member's really needed.
- Get the legless cripple!

874
01:48:31,322 --> 01:48:35,235
- You're not getting away!
- The gate's closed.

875
01:48:38,922 --> 01:48:42,676
Jump down, come here, mate.

876
01:49:16,322 --> 01:49:18,552
Show your documents.

877
01:49:18,642 --> 01:49:22,476
The documents ran away with
the cashier and the money.

878
01:49:24,322 --> 01:49:30,875
- Where's your William tell?
- He ran off with Tarakanov.

879
01:49:30,962 --> 01:49:37,800
- Where to?
- He took a horse off me and rode off.

880
01:49:37,882 --> 01:49:40,396
In what direction?

881
01:49:41,122 --> 01:49:43,556
- The one with the caravan?
- Yes!

882
01:49:43,642 --> 01:49:47,237
The Lagutin gang came and
took them to the monastery.

883
01:49:47,322 --> 01:49:50,234
Right, bring all your performers to me.

884
01:49:50,322 --> 01:49:52,836
I have a serious job for you.

885
01:49:52,922 --> 01:49:56,710
Will you help me to beat the
bandits in the monastery?

886
01:50:07,162 --> 01:50:12,919
- Father Innokentiy! Hello there!
- Uncle Marquis!

887
01:50:14,522 --> 01:50:18,754
- Uncle Marquis!
- How are you?

888
01:50:27,522 --> 01:50:32,516
Bonjour, Monsieur Makar!
We're keeping each other company again!

889
01:50:34,162 --> 01:50:40,954
- I don't keep scum company.
- Scum?

890
01:50:47,802 --> 01:50:50,236
Let's not quarrel before death!

891
01:50:50,322 --> 01:50:53,234
Until my death and after my death
I will call you scum.

892
01:50:53,322 --> 01:50:55,153
Who are you fighting for?

893
01:50:55,242 --> 01:50:57,802
You go down on your knees
for emigrants and the global bourgeoisie.

894
01:50:57,882 --> 01:50:59,713
Enough!

895
01:51:02,482 --> 01:51:07,078
I'll tell you the truth. I don't have
anything to do with the global bourgeoisie.

896
01:51:08,802 --> 01:51:11,441
I simply want to preserve for our descendants...

897
01:51:11,522 --> 01:51:12,750
All these knick-knacks that
you and I are fighting about.

898
01:51:12,842 --> 01:51:18,075
You're lying! Who were you fighting for? For him?

899
01:51:18,162 --> 01:51:25,034
There's our descendant, you were
fighting for him? No other moves?

900
01:51:28,002 --> 01:51:31,631
Hey, who's there? Pass up my brush.

901
01:51:36,002 --> 01:51:38,391
Daniil?

902
01:51:46,122 --> 01:51:48,078
Daniil, I got hold of some felt boots for you.

903
01:51:48,162 --> 01:51:52,713
- Innokentiy! Is it really you?
- It's me, it's me!

904
01:51:52,802 --> 01:51:58,035
- The boots are almost new!
- Thank you, kind soul!

905
01:51:58,122 --> 01:52:01,319
My legs, Innokentiy, don't want to go at all.

906
01:52:01,402 --> 01:52:04,951
- You haven't forgotten how to grind colours?
- No?

907
01:52:10,002 --> 01:52:13,836
Yes, it's funny how my life turned out.

908
01:52:16,282 --> 01:52:19,831
I had a scholarship to the Academy of Arts.

909
01:52:19,922 --> 01:52:22,482
They sent me to Italy on the public purse.

910
01:52:23,322 --> 01:52:29,272
I was a hunter, a circus performer.

911
01:52:32,522 --> 01:52:34,478
A chariot-driver at the hippodrome.

912
01:52:36,962 --> 01:52:42,195
I was a pilot, and then an
educator of aristocrats, children.

913
01:52:42,282 --> 01:52:47,356
Even a photographer, but never an artist!

914
01:52:50,002 --> 01:52:53,278
You didn't have any real aims.

915
01:52:57,162 --> 01:53:01,235
- And do you?
- I do!

916
01:53:01,322 --> 01:53:04,712
I live for the revolution,
for the bright future of all mankind.

917
01:53:04,802 --> 01:53:10,240
So that this lad here... ach!

918
01:53:10,322 --> 01:53:13,359
If I escape the bullet, take my word for it.

919
01:53:13,442 --> 01:53:15,637
Innokentiy will be a revolutionary artist.

920
01:53:15,722 --> 01:53:19,192
- But you and I won't live to see it.
- We'll see, we'll see!

921
01:53:21,322 --> 01:53:28,672
And I warn you, just in case,
you won't escape a revolutionary court.

922
01:53:28,762 --> 01:53:31,276
I agree!

923
01:53:32,322 --> 01:53:37,521
I trust that a proletarian court will
be more humane than Lagutin's.

924
01:53:39,562 --> 01:53:43,475
Do you think there's a possibility, Makar...

925
01:53:43,562 --> 01:53:46,520
That some of your lot know that you're here?

926
01:53:46,602 --> 01:53:48,877
What's it to you?

927
01:53:48,962 --> 01:53:54,992
Since the bandits are destroying,
looting and plundering everything.

928
01:53:55,402 --> 01:54:03,082
- Are you coming round or pretending?
- Let's say I've come round.

929
01:54:15,002 --> 01:54:18,881
The circus is coming! Open the gates!

930
01:55:11,562 --> 01:55:15,601
Well then, you're ready, I hope?

931
01:55:39,962 --> 01:55:43,238
My dear sir, my people say
that they saw you in the circus.

932
01:55:43,322 --> 01:55:47,031
It seems you demonstrated fantastic marksmanship?

933
01:55:47,122 --> 01:55:48,953
In a William Tell outfit.

934
01:55:49,042 --> 01:55:52,034
That's right! ...He's the one!

935
01:55:52,122 --> 01:55:54,636
Kolya, untie him.

936
01:56:02,522 --> 01:56:07,232
I offer you a little amusement. In this
barrel there are seven bullets.

937
01:56:09,802 --> 01:56:15,160
lf, with these seven bullets, you shoot
off the heads of these seven Terpsichores...

938
01:56:15,242 --> 01:56:18,917
I will leave you on the list of the living in this world.

939
01:56:19,002 --> 01:56:21,800
And even set you free wherever you wish to go.

940
01:56:21,882 --> 01:56:24,794
I don't shoot women!

941
01:56:29,402 --> 01:56:31,472
You're an educated man!

942
01:56:31,562 --> 01:56:35,521
To destroy a work of art is barbaric, in my view!

943
01:56:35,602 --> 01:56:40,392
You are mistaken, dear sir.

944
01:56:40,482 --> 01:56:45,317
There is no sweeter pleasure for an intelligent man...

945
01:56:45,402 --> 01:56:47,962
Than to destroy a world masterpiece!

946
01:56:49,722 --> 01:56:54,273
To destroy, and I also know simple people.

947
01:56:56,242 --> 01:56:59,757
Brothers! Do you need these stone women?

948
01:56:59,842 --> 01:57:04,279
Or do you need healthy, hard-working, living girls?

949
01:57:06,122 --> 01:57:10,479
Choose, dear sir, either you shoot, or I do.

950
01:57:10,562 --> 01:57:13,235
Of course, I shoot worse than you do.

951
01:57:13,322 --> 01:57:16,519
But all the same, I'm sure that
at least one of these seven bullets...

952
01:57:16,602 --> 01:57:21,232
At this distance is enough for me to
splatter your brains all over.

953
01:57:21,322 --> 01:57:28,273
I'll count to three. One! Two!

954
01:57:35,082 --> 01:57:42,397
- Alright! I agree! You swine!
- It's the people's treasure!

955
01:59:18,202 --> 01:59:20,272
A death-defying act!

956
01:59:23,122 --> 01:59:29,834
Members of the audience with a nervous
disposition, please leave the circus!

957
02:01:06,082 --> 02:01:09,677
Hands up! Come on!

958
02:01:11,322 --> 02:01:15,361
Hey guys, he's out of ammo! Put down your gun!

959
02:01:16,842 --> 02:01:21,358
Go to the door and unbolt it! I said to the door!
Unbolt it!!

960
02:01:43,602 --> 02:01:47,072
Close the gates! The reds are coming!

961
02:03:17,962 --> 02:03:21,034
Mister! They're going to kill Makar!

962
02:03:21,122 --> 02:03:24,432
- Where?
- In the tower!

963
02:04:12,282 --> 02:04:15,240
Take them! Take them, bandy-legs!

964
02:04:16,322 --> 02:04:21,237
- Go away! Go away, damn you!
- Brothers, save the caravan!

965
02:04:38,962 --> 02:04:42,398
Take the caravan to the forest!

966
02:05:34,002 --> 02:05:38,075
Listen, you! You're not going anywhere without me!

967
02:05:43,082 --> 02:05:45,312
Get out the way!

968
02:05:49,322 --> 02:05:58,754
Stop! Stop!

969
02:07:20,122 --> 02:07:24,115
My God! Ataman Lagutin!

970
02:07:26,442 --> 02:07:35,601
Where's the collection?
Where's the treasure? Where?

971
02:08:24,042 --> 02:08:32,552
Well, why have you gone silent,
Father Innokentiy?
