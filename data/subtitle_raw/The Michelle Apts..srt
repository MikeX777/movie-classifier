1
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:32,777
You're here for the convention?

2
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,237
Biggest damn one we've ever had.

3
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,073
I'm not here for any convention.

4
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,325
What line of work you in?

5
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,162
I work for the government.

6
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,788
Auditing.

7
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,832
Ooh...taxes!

8
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,708
Well, I wouldn't worry.

9
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,710
I only review large companies.

10
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,462
Well, there's only one company around here
worth a shit...

11
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,007
Turnbull Chemicals.

12
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,681
You hear about our little tragedy last week?

13
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,058
No.

14
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,729
Bank manager, 20-year man.

15
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,273
Couldn't sleep, so he gets up and shoots his
neighbor's dog.

16
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,275
- Really? 
- Yeah.

17
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,278
And the owner goes to take a
look out.

18
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,363
And he shoots him, too.

19
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,575
He shot the owner?

20
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,493
Dead.

21
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:28,207
Then his wife comes to the window and
she gets plugged.

22
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,960
People saying she's the stupid one.
[Laughs]

23
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,797
Welcome to Walton.

24
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:56,611
Hartwell. Hartwell...Hartwell...

25
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,741
Nope, we gave your room up.

26
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,371
Uh, you gave it up?

27
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,753
Thanks, Marge.

28
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,844
I don't think you understand.

29
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,555
My room was confirmed.

30
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,811
Well there's nothing I can do about it now
because we're all full up.

31
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:38,236
Look.I'm very tired, and I'm sure it's just
some sort of mix up.

32
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:43,032
So why not just give me any room for tonight
and I'll straighten it up with the manager tomorrow.

33
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,119
I am manager.

34
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,539
Oh.

35
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,169
So aloha, Bub!

36
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:04,470
[Drunken chatter]

37
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,974
- Hello?...
- Hello, Operator.

38
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:14,856
Yes. I'm new in town and I need you
to connect me with a with a hotel.

39
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,650
- Well just use the yellow pages. .

40
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,070
Yes, I would. But there isn't any phonebook
here.

41
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,488
- Well where is it?

42
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,074
Well, I don't know. Like someone just ripped
it up.

43
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,952
- Ripped it up?

44
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:35,793
Well...again, if you could hook me up with 
uh...with uh...

45
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,545
Will you excuse me a moment?

46
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:40,673
Hey guys, if you just wait quietly and I'll
be finished in one minute.

47
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,011
[Rowdy laughter]

48
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,693
Hey, Alex!

49
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,241
Need hand with those bags? Say, how did you
know my name?

50
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,084
Say, how did you know my name?

51
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,921
Read it on your luggage tag.

52
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,298
Aha.

53
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,054
Aha. All the regular hotels be booked up on 
account of the the convention.

54
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,808
But I think it just might know a place.

55
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:43,361
Well, come morning, you go up two blocks,
cross one, talk to Mrs. Haggerty.

56
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,905
Tell her Ernie sent you.

57
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,646
Buenos Noches Amigo!

58
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,523
I beg your pardon?

59
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,651
That's Mexican for, "Hey there, stranger!"

60
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,278
Oh.

61
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,322
Coffee?

62
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,699
Thanks.

63
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:34,162
You look like a sad old dog with no bone to gnaw.

64
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,789
It's been a long day.

65
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,837
What is that on your shirt?

66
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,840
Oh, my God.

67
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,844
Must have been from that palm tree.

68
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,972
There's a john downstairs.

69
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,228
Do you mind watching my bags for me?

70
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,396
Sure.

71
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,652
Oh, and flush hard, 'cause it's a long way to the government.

72
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,446
[Laughs]

73
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,543
What's the matter?

74
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:11,384
Uh,my hotel gave up my room and this this cab
driver, Ernie

75
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,553
He said that you might have a have a place.

76
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,016
Well then

77
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,270
I guess we're going to have to show Mr. Hartwell his room.

78
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:36,325
I wouldn't have a thing if it weren't for 
Mrs. Henderson dying last night.

79
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,871
Dead as a bucket, just like that.

80
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,457
And here's the kitchen.

81
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:53,426
You mean the last person that lived here just died?

82
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:58,222
Oh, does that bother you?

83
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:03,311
Oh, well, I mean, she wasn't shot by her bank
manager, was she?

84
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:09,400
Oh, heaven's no!

85
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,653
Brain hemorrhage. Oh,

86
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:24,624
Oh my. That's right where it happened.

87
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,209
What?

88
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:34,216
They say that just before she died, she
vomited.

89
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,885
Oh.

90
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,472
I tried shampooing, but it just keeps coming back.

91
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,473
Uh huh.

92
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,186
Your keys

93
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,284
Good Morning.

94
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:47,498
I'm the auditor, I think you were expecting me.

95
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,752
We have been expecting you.

96
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,675
Alex Hartwell.

97
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,220
Sorry I'm late.

98
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,097
I'm Mr. Abernathy.

99
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,183
This is your desk.

100
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,353
Ok.

101
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,358
I'll pull some files to get you started.

102
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,610
Great.

103
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,890
You want one?

104
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,519
No, I'm fine.

105
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,690
Where are you staying?

106
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:58,194
Michelle apartments.

107
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,489
Haggerty's, place?.

108
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,240
Yes.

109
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,785
Why?

110
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,039
There's something funny about those two.

111
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,459
Funny?

112
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,962
Funny. Like they're related.

113
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,757
Well, they are married, aren't they?

114
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,469
Oh, no. I mean, they're related.

115
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,971
You know?

116
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,682
Well, they do have baby.

117
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,727
Did you see the baby?

118
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,176
I'm sorry.

119
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,057
I didn't see anyone.

120
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,645
Excuse me.

121
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,745
Nice lamp.

122
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,583
To bad it's broken.

123
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,212
I guess you'll have to fix it.

124
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,215
I guess I will

125
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,647
You know, a little porcelain cement will fix that
up in no time.

126
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,233
I'll remember that.

127
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:15,205
Listen, honey, I've got a stain on my shirt
and I need to know how to get it out.

128
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:21,462
Well, I'm not sure what it is, it seems to be
something sticky.

129
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,131
Right? Yeah.

130
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:30,804
Yeah, I know, I know, I mean, I wish I could
be there to help you out.

131
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:39,772
Listen, honey, I didn't get too much sleep
last night, so I'm really tired, OK?

132
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,151
Uhhuh. Yeah, me too.

133
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,237
Yeah. Yeah.

134
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,656
Bye.

135
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,851
Oh, yes, Mr. Hartwell.

136
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,561
I'm sorry, did I wake the baby?

137
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,772
Oh, you know, babies.

138
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,649
Anything little thing just sets them right off

139
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,234
Well, I hope it's OK.

140
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,611
It just have to get used to the new
surroundings.

[Baby Cries]

142
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,990
- What is it, Jellyroll?

143
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,995
Mr. Hartwell at the door again, Jules.

144
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,622
What can we help you with?

145
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,418
Well, there seems to be a problem with the
plumbing.

146
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,129
[Offscreen thump. Baby stops crying].

147
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,088
The plumbing?

148
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,006
Yes, it's making a lot of noise.

149
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,591
I had some trouble sleeping last night.

150
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,178
Oh, well, Jules will look at that today,
won't you, Jules?

151
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,930
Sure.

152
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:59,018
These things do have a habit of getting
worse, don't they?

153
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,729
Yes, they do.

154
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,147
Thank you.

155
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,136
- Mr. Abernathy. 
- Yes.

156
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:38,515
It seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.

157
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,978
Discrepancy?

158
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:52,780
There's three hundred and fifty thousand in
the environmental contingency and only

159
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,241
thirty one dollars in the interest.

160
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,287
Sounds like a possible journal entry error.

161
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,670
I'll need a copy of the bank statements, just to be sure.

162
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,672
The bank statements aren't kept here.

163
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,175
I'll have to phone up for them.

164
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,010
That'll be fine.

165
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,189
It's Abernathy.

166
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:34,863
Mr. Hartwell is asking questions about the
environmental contingency fund.

167
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,994
He wants to see a bank statement.

173
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,862
That was Mr Turnbull.

174
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,615
He'd like to see you in his office.

175
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,328
As soon as possible.

176
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,916
Human excrement.

177
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,795
That's what the son of a bitch threw on at
this time.

178
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,548
One day I'll catch the little fucker.

179
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:41,180
And pinch his head off...like a bug.

180
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,559
Probably just some kid.

181
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,905
So how do you like our little hamlet?

182
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,826
Well, I've never been any place quite like it.

183
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,746
This is the peak season.

184
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,124
Name your poison.

185
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,043
Nothing. Thanks.

186
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,256
My father said never trust a man who doesn't drink.

187
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,509
It's a bit early for me.

188
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,805
My father was also an asshole.

189
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,062
So where are you staying?

190
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,064
The Michelle Apartments.

191
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:40,530
Must be hard. Being in a strange town, not
knowing anybody.

192
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,409
You a family man, Alex?

193
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,287
I'm engaged.

194
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,500
Left the little woman at home, eh?

195
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:57,422
I know some people that would see that as an
opportunity.

196
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:06,682
Mr Turnbull, is there something specific you
wanted to discuss with me?

197
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,520
What is it?

198
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:14,648
Looks like a turkey.

199
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:16,483
You're right.

200
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:25,867
Can you believe it? And there isn't a stitch
of turkey meat in the whole damn thing.

201
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,413
[Laughs]

202
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,757
Wie geht es! Guten Abend!

203
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,134
That's German for, "How's it hanging?"

204
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,846
Ahah.

205
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,307
I got some news for you.

206
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:54,938
- Dumplings.
- Dumplings?

207
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,150
und Wienerschnitzel!

208
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:03,238
Oh, I Don't know, I'm not very big on exotic
food.

209
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,699
That's not exotic.

210
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,409
It's German.

211
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,493
Mama made it!.

212
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,247
Mm hmm.

213
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:15,042
That's the spirit.

214
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,758
Thanks.

215
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,019
You planning to eat here?

216
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,396
Oh, Hi.

217
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,483
Yes. I just ordered.

218
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,068
I think.

219
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,614
Bert's been giving you the B.S. about his mama?

220
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,703
There you go.

221
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,829
Wow!

222
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,707
How about you, good looking?

223
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,628
Just two packs of the usual Bert.

224
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,922
I keep telling her to eat more and smoke less.

225
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,048
Those things will kill you!

226
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,384
Not any faster than my mama's schnitzel.

227
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,762
Shh! Don't let mama hear you say that

228
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,258
You survived!

229
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,510
Survived?

230
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,138
Bert's cooking.

231
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,975
I hope so.

232
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,960
Did you get your lamp fixed?

233
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,546
Why?

234
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,175
I meant to ask you earlier.

235
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:39,019
Maybe you want to give me a hand with it?

236
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,730
Sure. If you'd like.

237
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,317
Are you good with your hands?

238
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:50,363
Yes, actually. And lamps are my specialty.

239
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,449
Really?

240
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,469
Thanks.

241
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,978
It's always so hot in here.

242
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,066
It's probably the heat.

243
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,986
From the, uh, dryer.

244
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:37,470
Where's Flo?
- Flo...

245
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,725
Flo , it's me!

246
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,226
Excuse me. There's nobody in there.

247
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:45,145
What are you doing here?

248
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:45,687
Flo!

249
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,898
Oh, do you mean Mrs. Henderson?

250
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,859
It's me, Dirk!

251
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,068
Listen. Dirk.

252
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,112
I'm the new tenant here.

253
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,655
Mrs. Henderson is dead.

254
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,491
Dead?

255
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,701
A few days ago,

256
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,038
What happened?

257
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,417
Me and Flo, we had a date!

258
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:13,590
Well, I guess she won't be going on any more
dates.

259
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,387
That isn't funny, pal!

260
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:23,183
You make fun of the dead and the dead will be
making fun of you.

261
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,748
Oh!

262
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,711
Oh no no no.

263
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,181
Living the bachelor life, huh?

264
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,189
You want to get yourself a little lady to do
that for you.

265
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,068
That's a good idea.

266
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,826
[Machine stops]

267
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,416
Washing's done.

268
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:15,253
Right! [Ahem]

269
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:30,059
So then I guess I should be getting back.

270
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:23,154
Mr. Harwell, what a surprise.

271
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,490
[Baby Cries]

272
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,576
I hope I'm not disturbing you, but it's about the noise.

273
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,495
Yes.

274
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,665
Now there's a stain on the ceiling.

275
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,000
Oh, my.

276
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,752
What's up, Jellyroll?

277
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,464
Mr. Hartwell says that there's a stain on the
ceiling.

278
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:46,386
I didn't see no stain when I was up there.

279
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:51,349
Oh, well, Jules, maybe you should go
 to Mr. Hartwell's room and take a closer look.

280
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,727
Sure. Anything else on your mind?

281
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,148
Well, there is one thing.

282
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:03,194
It seems that some of my laundry got mixed up
with someone else's.

283
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,322
Oh, don't say.

284
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:10,326
Yes. When I was sorting my laundry, I
discovered an extra sock.

285
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:14,080
Oh, dear, you're certainly have your fair
share of problems.

286
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:21,838
I believe it belongs to a young
woman, brunette, about so tall.

287
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,800
Oh, dear. Excuse me.

288
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:37,061
Listen, why don't you go get the sock and I'll take care of it.

289
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,523
Well I'd really rather return it myself, if that's OK.

290
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,444
[Off Screen] 
Jules, I think there's something wrong with the baby!

291
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,445
Just a second, Jellyroll.

292
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,866
Ok, I know you're busy, so why not just tell
me what apartment she's in?

293
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,329
Ok, pal. She's in 303.

294
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,372
[Off screen] 
Jules!.

295
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:27,904
Hi!

296
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,325
What do you want?

297
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:36,287
I think some of your laundry got mixed up
with mine.

298
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,664
I brought it to you.

299
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,041
It's in the bag.

300
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,296
Who's this, Maddie?

301
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,091
Our new neighbor.

302
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,302
He says some of his laundry got mixed up with
ours.

303
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,471
Is that right?

304
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:57,308
We have some of your laundry?

305
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:03,064
No, I do. You see, I was doing laundry with
your wife and uh...

306
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,149
...we weren't doing it together.

307
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,818
And she left and I did mine.

308
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:11,906
And then there was something in the dryer
that got mixed up with my load.

309
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,534
Your load.

310
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,245
Yes, it's Pretty common, really.

311
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,831
People's laundry gets mixed up all the time.

312
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,211
I didn't know that, did you know that Maddie?

313
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:31,968
You see, Maddy does all our laundry. 
Is that what's in the bag?

314
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,553
Yes.

315
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,349
Thank you.

316
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,145
That was a downright neighborly thing for you
to do.

317
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,522
It's nothing really.

318
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:48,526
Maddy, have we got enough of that home cooked
chili of yours for a good neighbor here?

319
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,902
I can't stay.

320
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:50,945
I have work to do.

321
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:54,699
Maddie makes some kind of hot chili.

322
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,034
Don't you, hon!

323
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,036
Well he says he can't stay.

324
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,537
Sure he can.

325
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,122
No, really. I can't.

326
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,915
Come on! There's lots of food.

327
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,671
Oh, I couldn't.

328
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,883
We feel insulted if you didn't join us.

329
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:22,852
Sorry.

330
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,854
It's OK.

331
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,081
To good neighbors.

332
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,971
So what aprtment you in?

333
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,141
203.

334
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:07,563
203...didn't some old lady live there?

335
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,776
Yes, she died, actually.

336
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,153
Is that right?

337
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,822
Not too long ago.

338
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,371
I wouldn't want to live in a place where the
last person died.

339
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,709
It doesn't really bother me.

340
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,548
You must be a pretty brave guy.

341
00:35:37,176 --> 00:35:40,137
Mmm, this is great chili.

342
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,058
Matty, you're not eating.

343
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,186
I told you I'm not hungry.

344
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,152
Open up.

345
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,576
Choo choo choo choo...

346
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,873
Wooo, woooo...

347
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:10,209
Here comes the big train.

348
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:16,632
Woo! woo! Coming into the tunnel...open up.

349
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:19,760
Atta girl.

350
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:27,101
Big train doesn't think you can get in there
unless the tunnel gets a little wider.Woo,

351
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,522
woo, woo!

352
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:34,859
Choo-choo-choo-choo.

353
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,120
Lick.

354
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:09,977
There that wasn't so bad, was it?

355
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,567
And she wonders why she's skin and bone.

356
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,292
I have to go.

357
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,503
I've got work to do.

358
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,091
Hey. You haven't finished.

359
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,926
What about dessert?

360
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:47,014
I bet Maddie's cooked up a big surprise for us.

Good morning, Mr. Hartwell.

363

Good morning.

364

Had the bank statements arrived yet?

365
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,427
Sorry, Mr. Hartwell, the copier is still down.

366
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,598
I was told I would have them on my desk this
morning.

I said perhaps they would be on your desk
this morning.

Well, I can't have that now, can I, Mr. Hartwell?

370

I'd like to see them on my desk this afternoon

371
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:12,368
Or would you rather be served with a court order.

372
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,371
I don't see any need for that.

373

Couldn't you make an exception?

379

Well, I wouldn't mind, but mama makes the
rules.

sour pork?

Are you inviting me for dinner again?

I think you invited yourself.

around for other people to find.

between us.

Yeah, but I mean, what if he sees us?

There's always that chance.

406
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,724
How did you ever get together with a guy like Dean?

407
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:47,606
I got pregnant. Then he went to prison.

What for?

409
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,907

up with my laundry, then I think it's a vomit stain

01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,810
Oh, you have flowers.

544
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:33,231
They're nice.

545
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,819
They're not really mine.

546
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:40,697
Are you taking care of them?

547
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:44,367
They're starting to wilt.

548
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,628
Oh is this you?

549
01:01:56,212 --> 01:02:01,050
Yes, that's me and my...sister.

550
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:07,056
You must be very close.

551
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,404
And

552
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,408
We're. Done.

553
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:30,329
That was quick.

554
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,249
Thanks.

555
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,683
I got some lipstick on you.

556
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:55,771
It doesn't matter.

557
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,835
[Knock on door]

558
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,632
That would be my cab.

559
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:26,511
Forget about it. Kiss me.

560
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:40,525
[Knock at door]

561
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:42,944
Hey, Alex. Open up.

[Whispering] 
It's Dean!

563
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:51,077
[Whispering]
 I thought you said he was in jail.

564
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,663
[Whispering]
He was.

565
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:06,008
Open the door. I've got something for you.

566
01:04:13,432 --> 01:04:15,309
Dean. Hi.

567

Alex.

568
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:18,521
You busy?

569
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:21,023
Yeah, I was just, uh...packing.

570
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,191
Where are you going?

571
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,735
I'm moving on.

572
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,281
I hope you're not leaving because of me.

573
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:29,991
Oh, of course not, no.

574
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:33,035
There's a stain on the ceiling..

575
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:34,412
Jesus...

576
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:43,963
What fuck is that?

577
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:47,508
I don't know, it just kind of appeared one night.

578
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:59,937
Oh, by the way...

579
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:03,357
Some guy...Abernathy?

580
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,235
He was at the front door today.

581
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:09,113
He didn't he didn't know the part when you were in.

582
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:13,492
So I told him that I'd get this to you.

583
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:14,535
Thanks.

584
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:17,705
At least I could do. After last night.

585
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:22,043
Right. Well, thanks for dropping this off.

586
01:05:27,214 --> 01:05:27,965
Fuck!

587
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:35,640
Things got pretty wild last night.

588
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,517
Yeah, it looks like it.

589
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,979
Got any beer?

590
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:47,610
I just called the cab, but I'll check.

591
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:55,910
Hey.

592
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,789
Hey. This here, a picture of your fiancee.

Yeah.

594
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:08,255
Well, it looks like I'm out of beer.

595
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:18,391
Maybe some other time.

596
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:26,941
Say you know anything About Maddie doing some
kind of wild dance last night at the diner?

597
01:06:28,025 --> 01:06:32,738
No, I ate there last night, but I didn't see Maddie.

598
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,534
What time would that have been?

599
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,870
Around dinner time.

600
01:06:40,996 --> 01:06:44,083
Listen, why don't we go out and pick up a couple of beer?

601
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:48,212
I thought you said you had a cab coming.

602
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:52,883
That's right. But it's no problem.

603
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:10,526
Hey. Maddie's got a hat just like this,

604
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:12,403
Really?

605
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:14,905
Just got that from my fiancee.

606
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:23,956
This..Looks like Madeleine's hair.

607
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:27,626
No, that's not Madeleine's hair.

608
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:53,903
How the fuck would you know, asshole?

609
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,405
uh, I don't.

610
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,991
I mean, uh, I don't know.

611
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,954
This is definitely Maddie's hat.

612
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:08,334
Alright then, um...I'll tell you the truth.

613
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:13,547
She gave it to me.

614
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:14,548
Maddie?

615
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:16,967
Maddie gave you her hat?

616
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:20,054
Um... to give to my fiancee.

617
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:23,265
Why? Why would she do that?

618
01:08:25,976 --> 01:08:27,353
I don't know!

619
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:32,066
Well, then come up with something fast!

620
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:34,360
Ok. Hey!

621
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:39,532
- You fucked my wife, didnt you?

Really? Sorry about everything. But I'm out of here.

630
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:13,899
If I were you, I'd be thinking about getting a divorce.

631
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,823
Oh, my God.

632
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:54,690
Is he dead?

633
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:13,918
What are we going to do?

634
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,503
We have to call police.

635
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,429
Are you out of your mind?

636
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,598
How do you think this looks?

637
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:31,185
- How does what look? 
- Don't be a fool.

638
01:10:31,852 --> 01:10:33,312
I'm in your apartment.

639
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:34,980
Dean comes looking for me.

640
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:37,316
And he winds up dead?

641
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,276
It was an accident.

642
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:42,029
Think about it.

643
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:48,661
Have you ever been to prison, Alex?

644
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,920
We have to work together.

645
01:11:47,177 --> 01:11:50,931
He was going to kill, you know that, don't you?

646
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:58,772
And I'm the only one who can save you, aren't I?

647
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:00,899
Yes..

648
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:03,819
Do you know what we have to do?

649
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:06,905
Do you.

650
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:09,616
Oh, yes.

651
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:11,410
Oh, yeah.

652
01:12:30,637 --> 01:12:32,222
We have to get rid of the body.

653
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:33,432
Yes.

654
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,728
Ye...

655
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:45,569
What?

656
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:16,100
[Out of breath] 
I can't get him in.

657
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:17,684
Stand him up!

658
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:36,912

659
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,622
We're going up!

660
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,291
Just relax, will you?

661
01:13:57,474 --> 01:13:59,184
We're going down.

662
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:20,038
Where are you taking that rug?

663
01:14:20,164 --> 01:14:21,415
I'm taking the rug...

664
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:25,711
to get it cleaned. There's a stain on it.

665
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:26,670
Oh.

666
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:31,675
You want a hand? That looks kind of heavy.

667
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:34,344
I'm sure we can handle it.

668
01:14:47,774 --> 01:14:49,484
Have a good night.

669
01:14:57,784 --> 01:14:59,203
Oh, my God.

670
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,288
I can't go through this.

671
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,790
Just relax, OK?

672
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,044
Jules don't know shit.

673

[Muffled Moan]

674
01:15:19,389 --> 01:15:21,141
What was that?

675
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:24,561
[Moan continues]

676
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:31,360
It's Dean!

677
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,111
Stop the car.

678
01:15:33,445 --> 01:15:35,322
He's alive!

679
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:36,990
Stop the car!

680
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:45,624
We have to get them to a hospital quick.

681
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:52,339
Madeleine?

682
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:56,260
What are you doing?

683
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:02,099
He's alive!

684
01:16:39,386 --> 01:16:41,638
Get him out of the car.

685
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:45,142
This is no good.

686
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:50,731
What are you talking about?

687
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:53,609
I have to go to the police.

688
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,736
Oh, yeah.

689
01:16:56,528 --> 01:17:00,657
Yeah. And while we're there, we can give
your fiancee a call,

690
01:17:03,535 --> 01:17:04,328
hmm?

691
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,876
It happened in your apartment.

692
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:14,296
Jules saw you with the carpet.

693
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:18,175
Your prints are all over this car.

694
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:23,388
Now get off your lying little butt and get
him out.

695
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,667
Don't just stand there...

696
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:55,003
Sink him!

697
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:21,530
He's stuck.

698
01:18:22,155 --> 01:18:24,574
Sink him!

699
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,793
What in hell happened to you?

700
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:43,964
Oh, that's a nasty bump.

701
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:46,841
Why don't you sit down?

702
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:53,974
When I didn't hear from you, I came round to check.

703
01:20:54,558 --> 01:20:57,644
Honey, will you bring a glass of water?

704
01:20:58,478 --> 01:21:00,480
The door was open.

705
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:04,859
I hope you don't mind.

706
01:21:11,741 --> 01:21:14,744
[Pipes banging]

707
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:29,843
Thanks, Hon. And could you get Mr. Hartwell his packet, please?

708
01:21:35,098 --> 01:21:37,601
I understand you two have met.

709
01:22:06,087 --> 01:22:14,387
Now...my man Abernathy, has prepared an audit
on your behalf.

710
01:22:15,221 --> 01:22:17,932
Should be everything you need to make your report.

711
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:22,062
Go on, open it.

712
01:22:31,988 --> 01:22:38,453
And we threw in a little extra bonus for you
and the little woman.

713
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:42,082
Sort of a honeymoon donation.

714
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:04,562
So now what do you have to say?

715
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:09,401
Dean is dead.

716
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:13,279
She killed him.

717
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:19,244
What the fuck is he talking about?

718
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,455
Where's Dean?

719
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:24,207
Beats me.

720
01:23:24,582 --> 01:23:27,877
She hit him in the head with a golf club.

721
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:31,756
What kind of shit you trying to pull
Hartwell?

722
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:38,847
Hartwell? What's the deal here?

723
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:43,518
[Knock at the door]

724
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:58,116
Oh, excuse me. Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Hartwell

725
01:23:58,324 --> 01:24:02,037
but I thought I should take a look at that stain you mentioned.

726
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:10,253
Wow. You weren't shittin'.

727
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,465
Maybe you could come back a bit later.

728
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:14,966
If you don't mind.

729
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:19,888
Actually, I do mind.

730
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:23,391
Now, what the hell is this?

731
01:24:29,773 --> 01:24:31,858
Dean is dead.

732
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:34,903
What?

733
01:24:36,529 --> 01:24:38,698
My boy's dead?

734
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:44,662
What about the baby?

735
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:49,083
You really think I would have had it if it was yours?

736
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,800
Shoot him.

737
01:25:00,053 --> 01:25:01,679
Just..just like that?

738
01:25:03,139 --> 01:25:09,437
Honey, I love you and everything, but you really 
got to start showing some initiative.

739
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:11,356
Ok, OK.

740
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:17,070
Ok, get down on the floor.

741
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:18,780
Piss off you little shit.

742
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:20,114
Get out of here.

743
01:25:21,699 --> 01:25:25,203
I mean it, man, get down the floor.

744
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:30,041
Oh, for God's sake.

745
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,670
[Shots firing]

746
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:40,093
You got him!.

747
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:42,095
Now what?

748
01:25:51,604 --> 01:25:55,316
Mr. Hartwell kills himself.

749
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:17,333
