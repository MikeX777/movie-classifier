00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,406
Hey.

497
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,160
Well, that wasn't such a chore,
now, was it?

498
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:13,207
Mr. Smith, quickly.
I want that door open now!

499
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,167
Donald, stand over there.

500
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,545
We came, we saw,
we kicked its ass!

501
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,130
Did you see it?
What is it?

502
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,632
We got it.

503
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,801
What is it?
Will there be any
more of them?

504
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:26,887
Sir, what you had there
was what we refer to as a focused,

505
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:30,808
non-terminal repeating phantasm,
or a class-five full-roaming vapor.

506
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,685
Real nasty one too.

507
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,687
And now,

508
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,188
let's talk seriously.

509
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:40,734
Now, for the entrapment, we're
gonna have to ask you for four
big ones, $4000 for that.

510
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:44,071
But we are having a special
this week on proton charging

511
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,572
and storage of the beast.

512
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,242
That's only gonna come to
1000 dollars, fortunately.

513
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,996
Five thousand dollars?
I had no idea it'd be so
much. I won't pay it.

514
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,331
That's all right. We can
just put it right back in there.

515
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,375
We certainly can, Dr. Venkman.

516
00:38:56,543 --> 00:39:00,087
No! All right! Anything.

517
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:01,588
Thanks so much.

518
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,549
Thank you. Hope
we can help you again.

519
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,552
Coming through! One class-five
free-roaming vapor.

520
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,847
Good Morning, I'm Roger Grimsby.
Today the entire Eastern seaboard

521
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:13,058
is alive with talk of incidents
of paranormal activity.

522
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:16,145
Alleged ghost-sightings
and related supernatural
occurrences

523
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,939
have been reported
across the entire tri-state area.

524
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:21,650
Everybody has heard ghost stories
around the campfire.

525
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:24,987
Heck, my grandma used to spin
yarns about a spectral locomotive

526
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:27,656
that would rocket past the
farm where she grew up.

527
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,908
But now, as if
some unforeseen authority...

528
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,994
[♪♪♪]

529
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,086
[ALARM WAILING]

530
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,638
Stand aside, please!

531
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,059
Hi, this is Larry King. The phone-in
topic today, ghosts and ghostbusting.

532
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,770
The controversy builds,
more sightings are reported.

533
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,438
Some maintain that these

534
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:03,317
professional paranormal
eliminators in New York
are the cause of it all.

535
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,115
I got it! I got it!

536
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,118
Pete! Ray!

537
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:24,338
CASEY KASEM: Still making
headlines all across the country,

538
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:28,133
the Ghostbusters are
at it again, this time at
the fashionable dance club,

539
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:32,096
The Rose. The boys in gray slugged
it out with a pretty pesky poltergeist,

540
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:36,141
then stayed on to dance the night
away with some of the lovely ladies
who witnessed the disturbance.

541
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:39,353
This is Casey Kasem.
Now on with the countdown.

542
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,647
Twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week.

543
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,525
No job is too big.
No fee is too big.

544
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,487
Is it just a mist,
or does it have arms and legs?

545
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:51,281
As they say in TV, I'm sure
there's one big question

546
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,660
on eνerybody's mind and I imagine
you are the man to answer that.

547
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,996
How is Elvis, and have
you seen him lately?

548
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,543
Do you believe in UFOs,
astral projections,

549
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:47,171
mental telepathy, ESP,
clairvoyance,

550
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,382
spirit photography,
telekinetic movement,

551
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:55,429
full-trance mediums, the Loch Ness
monster and the theory of Atlantis?

552
00:41:55,597 --> 00:41:59,725
Uh, if there's a steady
paycheck in it, I'll
believe anything you say.

553
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,896
RAY:
I gotta get some sleep.
I'm dying.

554
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,480
You don't look good.

555
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,566
I don't?
Well, you've looked better.

556
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,401
You didn't used to look like this.

557
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,486
Can you hold, please?

558
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,239
Here's the paper on the
Brooklyn. She paid with Visa.

559
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,533
Here's tonight's worksheet.

560
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,368
Oh, great. Two more
free repeaters.

561
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,538
This is Winston Zeddmore.
He's here about the job.

562
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,583
Beautiful. You're hired.
Ray Stantz, Pete Venkman.

563
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:28,045
Congratulations.
Can you help me, please?

564
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:32,966
Welcome aboard.

565
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:36,595
I don't know where they get
these guest conductors.

566
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:39,514
I mean, someone should tell him
it's not gonna do much good
to scream at us in German.

567
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:43,060
Well, I don't think that
the man is competent
to conduct

568
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,686
a major symphony orchestra.

569
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:51,026
Um, could you wait here a minute?
Huh? Uh, sure.

570
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,575
Dr. Venkman. This is a surprise.

571
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:01,078
That was a wonderful rehearsal.
You heard that?

572
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:03,163
Yes. You're the best
one in your row.

573
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,790
Oh, thank you.

574
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:08,502
You're good. Most people
can't hear me with the
whole orchestra playing.

575
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,295
Ah, I don't have
to take this abuse from you.

576
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,756
I got hundreds of people
dying to abuse me.

577
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,967
I know. You're a
big celebrity now.

578
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:18,345
Do you have some information
for me on my case?

579
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,351
Who's the stiff?

580
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:28,063
The stiff happens to be one of
the finest musicians in the world.

581
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:30,065
Do you have some information
for me, please?

582
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,776
PETER:
Well, sure, but I prefer
to give it to you in private.

583
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:36,280
DANA: Why don't you tell me now?
Okay. I found the name Zuul for you.

584
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:41,952
Well, the name Zuul refers
to a demigod worshiped
around 6000 B.C. by the...

585
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,329
What's that word?

586
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,081
"Hittites."
Hittites,

587
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:49,334
the Mesopotamians
and the Sumerians.

588
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,713
"Zuul was the minion of Gozer."

589
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,090
What's Gozer?

590
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:59,469
Gozer was very big in Sumeria.
Well, what's he doing in my icebox?

591
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,639
I'm working on that. If we could
get together Thursday night,

592
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:06,143
I'm thinking 9-ish, you know,
we could exchange information.

593
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:09,604
I can't see you
Thursday. I'm busy.

594
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:14,067
Miss Barrett, you seem to think
there is something wrong
up here that says, in your mind:

595
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:17,529
"He enjoys taking his
evenings off and spending
it with his clients."

596
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:22,367
No. I'm making
a special exception
in your case because...

597
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,036
I respect you.

598
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,330
It's corny, but I respect
you as an artist.

599
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:30,375
And as a dresser too. This
is a magnificent coordination
you have going here today.

600
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,045
I'll see you Thursday.
I'll bring the Roylance Guide

601
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,422
and we'll eat and read.

602
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,306
So who the hell is that?
He's just a friend.

603
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:45,891
A friend?
An old friend.

604
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,726
Bye! Well, I'll see
you Thursday!

605
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:51,605
I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you, sir.
I'm glad you're feeling much better.

606
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:54,649
You're still very pale, though.
A little sun.

607
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:57,486
Well, what does he do?
He's a scientist.

608
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:13,001
This is where we store all the vapors
and entities and slimers that we trap.

609
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:18,548
Very simple, really. A loaded trap
here. Open, unlock the system.

610
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,050
Insert the trap.

611
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,887
Release.

612
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:28,433
Close, lock the system.
Set your entry grid.

613
00:45:28,643 --> 00:45:30,060
Neutronize your field.

614
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:32,187
And...

615
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:34,981
when the light is green,
the trap is clean.

616
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,110
The ghost is incarcerated here
in our custom-made storage facility.

617
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:41,863
There's a man from
the EPA here to see you.
He's waiting in your office.

618
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:44,658
EPA? What's he want?
I don't know.

619
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:47,828
All I do know is I've been
working two weeks
without a break,

620
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,705
and you promised me
you'd hire more help.

621
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,208
Janine, someone
with your qualifications

622
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:57,254
would have no trouble finding
a topflight job in either

623
00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:00,257
the food service or
housekeeping industries.

624
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:05,095
Are you gonna answer that?
I've quit better jobs than this.

625
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,722
Ghostbusters! What do you want?

626
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,475
Can I help you?
I'm Walter Peck.

627
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:14,312
I represent the
Environmental Protection
Agency, the third district.

628
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,982
Great. How's it
going down there?

629
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,194
Are you Peter Venkman?

630
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,780
Yes, I'm...

631
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,282
Dr. Venkman.

632
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:28,243
Exactly what are you a
doctor of, Mr. Venkman?

633
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:31,830
Well, I have Ph.D.'s in
parapsychology and psychology.

634
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:34,416
I see.

635
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:37,461
And now you catch ghosts.

636
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,629
Yeah. You could say that.

637
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,632
And how many ghosts have you
caught, Mr. Venkman?

638
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,469
I'm not at liberty to say.
And where do you put

639
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,513
these ghosts
once you catch them?

640
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:51,141
Into a storage facility.

641
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,644
And would this storage facility
be located on these premises?

642
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:59,483
Yes.
And may I see this storage facility?

643
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,028
No.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?

644
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,824
Because you did not use
the magic word.

645
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:13,747
What is the magic word,
Mr. Venkman?

646
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,416
"Please."

647
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:21,546
May I please see the storage
facility, Mr. Venkman?

648
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:23,215
Why do you want to see
the storage facility?

649
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,675
Well, because I'm curious.

650
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,261
I want to know more about
what you do here.

651
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,264
Frankly, there've been a lot
of wild stories in the media

652
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:34,351
and we want to assess
any possible
environmental impact

653
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:35,852
from your operation.

654
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,063
For instance, the presence
of noxious,

655
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,525
possibly hazardous waste
chemicals in your basement.

656
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:45,904
Now, you either show me what
is down there, or I come back
with a court order.

657
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:50,992
You go get a court order,
and I'll sue your ass
for wrongful prosecution!

658
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:54,538
You can have it your way,

01:31:53,425 --> 01:31:55,259
by the fire
at Camp Waconda.

1158
01:31:57,053 --> 01:32:01,265
Ray has gone bye-bye, Egon.
What have you got left?

1159
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:06,770
Sorry, Venkman.
I'm terrified beyond the
capacity for rational thought.

1160
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:19,783
Oh, no.
Mother pus bucket.

1161
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:27,082
Nobody steps on a church
in my town.

1162
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:30,211
One, two, three, roast him.

1163
01:32:50,023 --> 01:32:51,649
Funny, us going
out like this.

1164
01:32:51,816 --> 01:32:54,151
Killed by a 100-foot
marshmallow man.

1165
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:57,488
We've been going about this
all wrong. This Mr. Stay Puft
is okay. He's a sailor.

1166
01:32:57,656 --> 01:33:01,492
He's in New York.
We get this guy laid, we
won't have any trouble.

1167
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:08,457
I have a radical idea.
The door swings both ways.

1168
01:33:08,625 --> 01:33:11,126
We could reverse the particle
flow through the gate.

1169
01:33:11,294 --> 01:33:13,128
RAY:
How?

1170
01:33:13,296 --> 01:33:15,506
We'll cross the streams.
Excuse me, Egon.

1171
01:33:15,674 --> 01:33:17,466
You said crossing the
streams was bad.

1172
01:33:17,634 --> 01:33:20,761
Cross the streams.
You're gonna endanger us.

1173
01:33:20,929 --> 01:33:22,680
You're gonna
endanger our client,

1174
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:25,849
the nice lady who paid
us in advance before
she became a dog.

1175
01:33:26,059 --> 01:33:30,145
Not necessarily.
There's definitely a very
slim chance we'll survive.

1176
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:39,613
I love this plan. I'm excited
to be a part of it. Let's do it.

1177
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:43,492
This job is definitely not
worth 11,500 a year.

1178
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:48,622
Hurry.

1179
01:33:50,583 --> 01:33:52,960
See you on the
other side, Ray.

1180
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:57,881
Nice working with you,
Dr. Venkman.

1181
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:07,891
Let's turn them on, Spengler!

1182
01:34:11,146 --> 01:34:13,397
Now, Spengler!

1183
01:34:18,695 --> 01:34:20,571
Get out of here!

1184
01:35:11,289 --> 01:35:12,748
[GROANING]

1185
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:16,043
RAY: Winston.
WINSTON: Yeah.

1186
01:35:16,211 --> 01:35:17,961
RAY: Are you all right?
Yeah.

1187
01:35:23,176 --> 01:35:24,635
Venkman?

1188
01:35:24,803 --> 01:35:26,136
Spengler!

1189
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:28,639
Venkman!

1190
01:35:31,976 --> 01:35:33,477
Spengler.

1191
01:35:34,896 --> 01:35:37,731
Oh, Spengler.
Oh, are you okay?

1192
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:39,983
I feel like the floor
of a taxicab.

1193
01:35:40,193 --> 01:35:42,319
Venky!
PETER: Yeah, where are you?

1194
01:35:42,487 --> 01:35:44,822
Oh, thank God.

1195
01:35:45,949 --> 01:35:47,658
You okay?
I'm all right.

1196
01:35:47,826 --> 01:35:49,284
You all right?
I'm all right.

1197
01:35:49,452 --> 01:35:51,745
You all right?
Yeah. You okay?

1198
01:35:51,913 --> 01:35:53,414
Fine.

1199
01:36:00,588 --> 01:36:04,675
RAY: Oh, it smells like
barbecued dog hair.

1200
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:07,136
Oh, Venkman.

1201
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:09,513
Oh, Venkman, I'm sorry.

1202
01:36:10,223 --> 01:36:13,142
I'm sorry. I just-- I just forgot.

1203
01:36:27,532 --> 01:36:29,116
Look!

1204
01:36:30,285 --> 01:36:32,286
[♪♪♪]

1205
01:36:56,269 --> 01:36:59,062
Somebody turn on the lights!

1206
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:02,357
Help! Somebody!
Go check on that little guy.

1207
01:37:07,864 --> 01:37:09,781
What happened?

1208
01:37:16,414 --> 01:37:20,751
Oh. Oh. Where am I?

1209
01:37:22,587 --> 01:37:25,714
Oh, hi.

1210
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,925
EGON:
You'll be all right.

1211
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:31,929
Boy, the superintendent's
gonna be pissed.

1212
01:37:33,431 --> 01:37:35,349
Are you okay?

1213
01:37:36,017 --> 01:37:37,893
Who are you guys?

1214
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:40,103
We're the Ghostbusters.

1215
01:37:42,941 --> 01:37:44,358
Who does your taxes?

1216
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:48,237
RAY: You know, Mr. Tully,
you are a most fortunate individual.

1217
01:37:48,404 --> 01:37:50,697
I know.
You have been a participant in

1218
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:54,451
the biggest interdimensional
cross rip since the
Tunguska blast of 1909.

1219
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:56,787
Felt great.
We'd like to get a sample

1220
01:37:56,955 --> 01:37:59,831
of your brain tissue.
Okay.

1221
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:05,587
I love this town!

1222
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:07,965
[♪♪♪]

1223
01:38:49,424 --> 01:38:51,425
Egon!

1224
01:38:58,391 --> 01:39:00,309
What's going on?

1225
01:39:01,352 --> 01:39:03,687
Does anybody want
to interview me?

1226
01:39:03,896 --> 01:39:07,274
I'm an eyewitness. I was up there.

1227
01:39:07,817 --> 01:39:09,985
I want to go with them in the car.
