2
00:00:07,773 --> 00:00:10,289
So, what do you want to do today?

3
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:14,727
Um. I think I'm gonna get
some work done. Do you mind?

4
00:00:15,132 --> 00:00:17,678
No, I'll get some work done, too.

5
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:34,110
Are you seriously pretending
to be asleep right now?

6
00:00:34,112 --> 00:00:35,256
What?

7
00:00:35,258 --> 00:00:37,365
Get up! It's your turn.

8
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:39,433
I got up at three.

9
00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:40,975
I got up at five.

10
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:42,806
I went to bed at one.

11
00:00:43,036 --> 00:00:44,806
You were wasting time online.

12
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:46,649
I was writing!

13
00:00:57,547 --> 00:00:58,527
Hey, hon.

14
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:00,837
Hey. What're you doing today?

15
00:01:00,867 --> 00:01:03,201
Working. I'm about to head over to Trey's.

16
00:01:03,203 --> 00:01:04,821
You have to be back by, like, 5:30.

17
00:01:04,823 --> 00:01:05,721
I will be.

18
00:01:05,723 --> 00:01:06,873
'kay.

19
00:01:07,463 --> 00:01:10,051
Don't you and Trey ever
get sick of each other?

20
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:11,963
Lisa, he's my brother.

21
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:16,507
I know, I just miss
spending Saturdays with you.

22
00:01:16,738 --> 00:01:20,278
We literally have three
scripts due this week, so...

23
00:01:21,112 --> 00:01:22,620
What're you doing here?

24
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:23,730
Working out.

25
00:01:23,732 --> 00:01:24,820
Are those three pounds?

26
00:01:24,822 --> 00:01:26,090
Yeah.

27
00:01:26,092 --> 00:01:26,973
Can I feel it?

28
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:28,750
This isn't gonna do anything.

29
00:01:28,752 --> 00:01:30,884
You might as well be standing here, with no
weights, just moving your arms back and forth.

30
00:01:30,886 --> 00:01:32,648
Can't believe they sell these things.

31
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,903
Stop it.

32
00:01:33,905 --> 00:01:34,883
You can't... no...

33
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:36,975
It's for toning. I don't like to sweat.

34
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,082
I love you.

35
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,154
Don't be late!

36
00:01:42,156 --> 00:01:43,246
I won't!

37
00:01:48,926 --> 00:01:51,246
We haven't had sex in a while.

38
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,219
It's bullshit!

39
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:57,321
Well, we could do something
about it right now.

40
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,779
Bree. I'm never gonna say no.

41
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:05,989
Why am I the only one who
ever starts the dishwasher?

42
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:07,835
You didn't start the dishwasher!

43
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:09,785
What?!

44
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:10,861
Nothing.

45
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:14,924
Here, baby. Gonna sit right there.

46
00:02:18,944 --> 00:02:20,412
Mm-hm.

47
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:22,860
What's that?

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,260
What?

49
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,198
Nice 30-minute shower.

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,178
It was 16 minutes. I timed it.

51
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,178
How is it that I can get myself and the kids ready in the
same amount of time it takes you to get yourself ready?

52
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,028
Well, remember how we read that men's
brains aren't wired for multi-tasking?

53
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,258
Well, how about finishing a single task?
Like, you never start the dishwasher.

54
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,238
I start the dishwasher all the time.

55
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,508
You think if you do something once
every three weeks, you do it regularly.

56
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,150
Well, once every three weeks IS regularly.

57
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,837
Oh my ga. I want to kill you right now!

58
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,067
I'm anxious about tonight.

59
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:54,459
Why? It's gonna be fun.

60
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:59,069
It's gonna be awkward as hell.
You shouldn't have set it up.

61
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:04,489
You just, you have to admit,
you like to stir the pot.

62
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,469
It was Ginger's suggestion.
And Chris was fine with it.

63
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:15,227
I'll bet. Is he bringing that
girl? The one that he cheated with?

64
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:20,974
No. No. They're each
coming alone. They agreed.

65
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:27,039
Poor Ginger. I'll bet she's still a mess.

66
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,089
I've been thinking about Ginger.

67
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:30,692
Poor Ginger.

68
00:03:30,694 --> 00:03:35,166
I don't think it's a good idea for her
to be spending so much time in Texas.

69
00:03:35,168 --> 00:03:40,449
Last time she came back, she'd eaten so much fried
food, all she could fit into was her sweatpants.

70
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:42,878
Jesus.

71
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,109
Marriage is like a business contract.

72
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:50,057
Each party signs the contract because they're
getting certain things out of the deal...

73
00:03:50,059 --> 00:03:53,217
And when Chris married Ginger, part of the
deal was that she was slim and attractive.

74
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:56,231
Okay, but you shouldn't have to worry
about your spouse cheating on you...

75
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,975
just because you've gained
some weight over the years.

76
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:01,529
SOME weight?

77
00:04:01,531 --> 00:04:06,487
Okay, Ginger's gotten huge. But it's hard
for her 'cause she's such a good cook.

78
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:10,935
I mean, I don't know how Chris
stayed so slim all these years.

79
00:04:10,937 --> 00:04:14,475
He's self-disciplined because he's vain.

80
00:04:14,477 --> 00:04:19,225
I always knew he was going to cheat. There's no way a
guy who's that good-looking is going to stay faithful.

81
00:04:19,227 --> 00:04:23,326
You sound like you would've cheated
with him if you'd had the chance.

82
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:24,953
Unh...

83
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:27,328
Whatever. He was crazy to cheat on her.

84
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,055
She's cool and she cooks, like,
a four-course dinner every night.

85
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:32,824
I mean, who cares about sex
when you can eat like a king?

86
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:36,922
We're not leaving until we own this town.

87
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:40,096
Not this side, not the
Valley. The other side.

88
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:41,636
I've been thinking about Ginger.

89
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:43,977
Ah. Poor Ginger.

90
00:04:44,857 --> 00:04:51,936
Then I started thinking about our sisters and your
mother and my mother and all the women we know.

91
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:54,627
And it's like we've seen
them all act a little crazy.

92
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,341
Mm.

93
00:04:56,381 --> 00:05:00,533
So, I'm developing this theory.
That all women occasionally act nuts.

94
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:04,687
It's just a question of how nuts...
like, where are they on the continuum.

95
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:08,842
Yeah, well, that's what I like about women. I
think it's cool how they can be unpredictable.

96
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:15,518
It's holding us back. You know, it makes men uncomfortable
because they're only used to experiencing one emotion.

97
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:19,572
Or maybe several. But you know it all
funnels down to the same one... anger.

98
00:05:19,574 --> 00:05:22,018
And then they snap and
kill their whole family.

99
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,945
So, all men are angry?

100
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:28,140
Well, what blanket statement
can we make about men?

101
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:32,867
It's what Thoreau said. Most are
leading lives of quiet desperation.

102
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:36,092
You know, they go to work and they help
with the kids and they take out the trash

103
00:05:36,094 --> 00:05:40,027
And then they go to work and they help
with the kids and they take out the trash...

104
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:41,936
And the whole time? They're daydreaming.

105
00:05:41,938 --> 00:05:47,027
About being big and important and powerful
and screwing Scarlett Johansson. Or whoever.

106
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:49,265
I'll buy that.

107
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,325
You want to have sex
with Scarlett Johansson?

108
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:54,596
No, I meant I buy your theory, overall.

109
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:57,493
You don't want to have sex with her?

110
00:05:57,495 --> 00:06:00,038
I don't find her attractive.

111
00:06:00,088 --> 00:06:01,601
Right!

112
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:05,585
Believe it or not, when I fantasize
about having sex, it's with you.

113
00:06:05,587 --> 00:06:07,342
Always?

114
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:10,664
You never imagine yourself
having sex with anyone but me?

115
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:15,119
And you never imagine yourself
having sex with anybody but me?

116
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:18,621
I wish neither one of us were
ever attracted to anyone else.

117
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:23,411
It IS like that. Mostly. Seriously.

118
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:32,318
It's like everything is built on a foundation of
little white lies. We're living in a house of cards.

119
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:40,675
Who needs four cars?!

120
00:06:40,677 --> 00:06:44,267
I know. I guess they haven't heard
about the fossil fuel situation.

121
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:46,933
Michelle. We drive an
SUV and a station wagon.

122
00:06:46,935 --> 00:06:48,804
Yeah, but our next cars
are going to be hybrids.

123
00:06:48,806 --> 00:06:51,892
Oh, well, we can start judging
people once we get them.

124
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:53,389
'kay.

125
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:55,641
You should find out if he's hiring.

126
00:06:55,643 --> 00:06:56,342
Ugh.

127
00:06:56,362 --> 00:06:58,139
You haven't staffed in three seasons.

128
00:06:58,141 --> 00:07:00,627
He's a hack. And his brother's a clown.

129
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:03,318
A hack and a clown...

130
00:07:05,538 --> 00:07:08,186
You know that one of their
episodes is up for an Emmy?

131
00:07:08,188 --> 00:07:09,554
Really?

132
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:15,800
I can guarantee they didn't write it though. In
TV, everybody on staff contributes to every episode.

133
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,108
Well. This hack is 30 years old
and owns a house that costs...

134
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,065
$2.5.

135
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:24,769
Oh my god.

136
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:25,959
Hi!

137
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:27,477
Heeeey!!!

138
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:38,944
They never hear us because
this house is so big.

139
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,243
Lisa?

140
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:44,547
Josh?

141
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:53,681
Art. I guess they're collecting now.

142
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:58,169
That fucker. He's just
over here printing money.

143
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:05,096
Hello?

144
00:08:05,546 --> 00:08:07,285
Hello?

145
00:08:11,335 --> 00:08:12,133
Hi!

146
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:14,235
Hi! How are you?

147
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:16,397
Really good! How are you guys?

148
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,281
Good to see you!

149
00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:20,245
Glad you could make it finally.

150
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:23,124
We can stay out late, my mom's
babysitting for us, thank you.

151
00:08:23,126 --> 00:08:24,526
Yes!

152
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:26,392
I am going to drink my ass off.

153
00:08:26,394 --> 00:08:28,881
No, it's your turn to get up
with Emma and Chloe tomorrow.

154
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:31,865
Wow. I bet you guys can't
wait to have kids, right?

155
00:08:32,776 --> 00:08:35,886
No, you have to do it. Seriously, it's
the best thing that ever happened to me.

156
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:39,062
Actually, we're trying
to get pregnant, so...

157
00:08:39,292 --> 00:08:41,532
Yeah, I could be good
without kids, but... whatever.

158
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,811
What're you talking about? You totally
thought that baby was so cute at the barbecue.

159
00:08:44,813 --> 00:08:49,802
All babies are cute. That's their thing. But is
that any reason to make an irreversible decision?

160
00:08:49,804 --> 00:08:53,083
Well, if you didn't want to have
kids, we shouldn't have gotten married.

161
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,685
Nice.

162
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:56,586
What? I'm just saying.

163
00:08:56,588 --> 00:08:59,111
We're gonna tackle the big issues tonight!

164
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,810
So, where's Ginger and Chris?

165
00:09:02,812 --> 00:09:07,650
I told them not to come until 7:30, so that we
could have some time to discuss the situation.

166
00:09:07,652 --> 00:09:09,083
The puppet master.

167
00:09:09,085 --> 00:09:10,724
Stop calling me that.

168
00:09:10,726 --> 00:09:13,132
Wow. That picture is amazing.

169
00:09:13,572 --> 00:09:15,097
They got another TV?

170
00:09:15,717 --> 00:09:17,333
Check it out.

171
00:09:21,383 --> 00:09:23,631
Sloppy already.

172
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:26,770
So. Chris and Ginger are coming together?

173
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:28,998
No. Separately.

174
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:31,456
What was she doing in Texas?

175
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:35,035
I have no idea because
she's not on Facebook.

176
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:38,123
People who aren't on Facebook
think they're so cool.

177
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,969
No offense, Bree.

178
00:09:39,971 --> 00:09:42,962
But really it's just a huge pain in
the ass for anybody who loves them...

179
00:09:42,964 --> 00:09:44,845
because how are we
supposed to keep in touch?

180
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:47,380
Yeah. And she never checks her email, okay?

181
00:09:47,382 --> 00:09:50,737
She has this whole thing about how
email exists as a convenience to us...

182
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:54,094
and we're not supposed
to let it run our lives.

183
00:09:54,096 --> 00:10:00,304
And she says we have to consciously
decide how much time we're gonna give it.

184
00:10:00,404 --> 00:10:04,192
See? This is why I love her.
Who else says stuff like that?

185
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:08,245
I don't have time to consciously decide to
do anything. What am I gonna do, call her?

186
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:12,568
I don't have time to call everybody I want
to keep in touch with. I have children.

187
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,582
Well, she has Oliver.

188
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:18,734
Yeah, but he's 10. And there's a
huge difference between one and two.

189
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:25,656
When you have your first, you think it's so hard,
but when you have two, it's a whole other story.

190
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,289
You're complaining.

191
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,976
I'm not complaining, I'm just...

192
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:32,271
You ARE complaining.

193
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:37,780
Do you have Pepcid, or
something for stomachs?

194
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:39,103
What's the matter?

195
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:41,708
I don't know. I have
social anxiety or something?

196
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,892
Why? It's just us.

197
00:10:44,882 --> 00:10:47,118
And George and Martha.

198
00:10:47,618 --> 00:10:49,721
Who's George and Martha?

199
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:52,993
Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton.
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"

200
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:56,521
Oh, is that a good movie?

201
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,160
Is what good?

202
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,505
Uh, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?".

203
00:11:00,507 --> 00:11:02,030
I love that movie.

204
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:03,531
I've never seen it.

205
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,768
What's that noise?

206
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,973
Oh! Someone must be at the front door.

207
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:10,492
Shoot, it's 7:30 already?

208
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:19,574
Josh has never seen "Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?".

209
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:22,565
Hello!

210
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:23,727
Hey...

211
00:11:23,729 --> 00:11:24,782
Oh my gosh!

212
00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:27,450
You look amazing!

213
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:34,315
Oh... thank you! I still have a couple
more pounds to go, but I'm getting there.

214
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:36,961
No, you look awesome!

215
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,632
Oh, um, Lisa, this is Brad.

216
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:40,561
Hi.

217
00:11:40,563 --> 00:11:41,600
Hi.

218
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,404
You're cute!

219
00:11:43,464 --> 00:11:45,349
He's an actor.

220
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:47,138
Neat.

221
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:49,963
Uh, do you mind if I use your bathroom?

222
00:11:49,965 --> 00:11:52,408
Sure, yeah.

223
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,164
So...

224
00:11:54,166 --> 00:12:00,683
Uh, do you mind if I go, too? We came from Malibu
and you practically have to stop for snacks, you know?

225
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:03,688
Sure. Just use the
powder room, over there...

226
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:09,192
That's okay, I'll just use this one.

227
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,416
Okay.

228
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,107
Hey!

229
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:15,980
Uh...

230
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:17,504
Can we have sex?

231
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:18,621
Brad!

232
00:12:18,623 --> 00:12:20,428
I wanna go down on you.

233
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:21,737
Oh my ga.

234
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:25,872
So, last time we talked, you and Trey
were trying to write a movie together.

235
00:12:25,874 --> 00:12:30,975
It's not easy, is it? I always tell you TV guys features
aren't just longer, they're a whole different animal.

236
00:12:30,977 --> 00:12:33,128
It's hard to sustain a
story over a hundred pages.

237
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,663
It's done, man. We sold it last week.

238
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:39,639
Really? Who'd you guys sell it to?

239
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:42,061
Will Ferrell and Adam McKay.

240
00:12:43,351 --> 00:12:46,113
That's great. That's fantastic.

241
00:12:46,123 --> 00:12:48,306
Yeah, those guys are really funny.

242
00:12:48,336 --> 00:12:50,599
Yeah. They're doing alright.

243
00:12:50,601 --> 00:12:55,102
You're a smartass. How much?
If you don't mind me asking?

244
00:12:55,104 --> 00:12:58,204
Nah, it's fine, it was in the trades. 800.

245
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:01,741
$800,000?

246
00:13:01,743 --> 00:13:02,921
No, 800 dollars.

247
00:13:05,055 --> 00:13:06,209
Ah, man.

248
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:10,217
What's wrong? You look freaked out.

249
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:11,640
Ginger lost weight.

250
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:12,858
Really?!

251
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:20,323
Yeah. And she brought a guy. And she went to the bathroom,
and this kid... he's, like, 20... he asked if he could go, too.

252
00:13:20,325 --> 00:13:23,203
And they're in the bathroom
together, right now.

253
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:24,488
They're having sex?

254
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,349
I don't know.

255
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:26,487
In the powder room?

256
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:27,581
Yeah.

257
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:30,500
They better not get anything
on the wallpaper, it's vintage.

258
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:36,067
See that? Rich people have problems, too. They have
to worry about guests ejaculating on their wallpaper.

259
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,948
If I had said that, you would've
told me I was disgusting.

260
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,171
It was funny. Ryan is funny.

261
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:45,757
I'm a comedy writer!

262
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:48,134
You're funny, Dave. It's just
that Ryan is used to, you know...

263
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:51,983
getting up in front of a hundred people
and making them laugh their asses off.

264
00:13:52,153 --> 00:13:54,561
I can't believe you.

265
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:56,380
Oh my god!

266
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,255
Hi!

267
00:13:58,355 --> 00:13:59,673
You look awesome!

268
00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:00,986
Oh... thank you!

269
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:02,672
How did you lose the weight?

270
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:05,605
I just was so busy working.

271
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:07,110
How are you?

272
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:07,650
Josh.

273
00:14:07,652 --> 00:14:08,974
I was catering a movie.

274
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:09,697
In Austin?

275
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:13,332
Yeah. That's how I met Brad.
He was part of the cast.

276
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:14,808
How's Oliver?

277
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:17,608
He's great. He's with his
cousins. I go back on Monday.

278
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:20,972
What's that noise?

279
00:14:21,222 --> 00:14:23,487
Oh! Someone must be at the front door.

280
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:25,254
That must be Chris.

281
00:14:25,494 --> 00:14:27,519
Has he seen you yet?

282
00:14:27,939 --> 00:14:29,586
No.

283
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,924
He's going to shit a brick.

284
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:36,920
Hi!

285
00:14:36,922 --> 00:14:38,009
Hi!

286
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,299
How are you?

287
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:40,462
Good. Good.

288
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,555
Thank you.

289
00:14:45,195 --> 00:14:47,233
We haven't seen you in since...

290
00:14:47,235 --> 00:14:49,828
Forever. I know.

291
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:52,211
Ahh... Ginger came, right?

292
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:54,466
Yeah, she's here.

293
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:58,347
Hey, guys.

294
00:14:58,349 --> 00:14:59,460
What's up?

295
00:14:59,462 --> 00:15:00,735
How're you doing?

296
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:02,302
You look beautiful.

297
00:15:02,304 --> 00:15:03,822
Thank you.

298
00:15:03,912 --> 00:15:05,679
Ah, Chris. Nice to meet you.

299
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:07,587
You, too. Brad.

300
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:10,328
Ah. How do you know Josh and Lisa?

301
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:13,113
I just met them. I'm here with Ginger.

302
00:15:13,593 --> 00:15:15,079
Oh.

303
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:18,485
I thought we weren't bringing anyone?

304
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:20,551
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

305
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:27,815
You are wearing that outfit that I love.

306
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:29,384
Yeah...

307
00:15:29,654 --> 00:15:31,353
Who needs a drink?

308
00:15:31,355 --> 00:15:34,392
I do.

309
00:15:38,832 --> 00:15:41,507
This silverware has a
really nice weight to it.

310
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:45,094
I knew you'd notice. You
always appreciate nice things.

311
00:15:45,096 --> 00:15:46,994
Yeah, I noticed it, too, I was
thinking about stealing some.

312
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,825
Seriously, one spoon costs $200.

313
00:15:50,827 --> 00:15:54,250
I wanna hear some of your new
material. Can we, after dinner?

314
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:55,650
No. C'mon.

315
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:57,691
For us. C'mon.

316
00:15:57,693 --> 00:16:03,754
Alright, I got some. Truthfully, I've been traveling
so much that I really haven't had time to write.

317
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:06,336
Gotta make time. No excuses.

318
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:10,090
Right. No, I wrote today though, so...

319
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,488
So did I.

320
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,973
Well, you screwed around on the Internet.

321
00:16:14,063 --> 00:16:15,521
I was working.

322
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:21,237
Oh, listen, there's a service you can subscribe to that
blocks your access to the Internet for up to 8 hours a day.

323
00:16:21,239 --> 00:16:27,528
Is that where we're at right now? We can't be
self-disciplined, we have to pay someone to enforce discipline?

324
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:33,875
I know. It's lame. But, it only costs
$7.95 a month. It's totally worth it.

325
00:16:33,877 --> 00:16:36,267
Wow. You and Trey do that?

326
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:39,354
Ah, no. We don't have to.
We're very self-motivated.

327
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:40,742
Hm.

328
00:16:40,744 --> 00:16:42,444
That's fantastic.

329
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:46,054
So, Ry, where are you
performing these days?

330
00:16:46,764 --> 00:16:51,120
All over. Atlanta. Dallas. Pittsburgh.

331
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:52,662
Have you been going with him, Bree?

332
00:16:52,664 --> 00:16:55,037
No. I tape five shows a week, so...

333
00:16:55,157 --> 00:16:56,779
Oh. Right.

334
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:58,784
That many?

335
00:16:58,894 --> 00:17:01,672
Have you watched her
show? Oh, it's fantastic.

336
00:17:01,674 --> 00:17:03,674
I keep forgetting, I'm sorry.

337
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:05,382
I don't have time for that.

338
00:17:05,384 --> 00:17:06,815
Send me the link again.

339
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:12,683
I can't believe this. My own friends. You know, I
have strangers writing me and telling me they love it.

340
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:16,111
This one guy told me it
restored his faith in humanity.

341
00:17:16,113 --> 00:17:18,449
But it's opera, right?

342
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:19,836
That's a tough sell.

343
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,222
I don't have time to watch webisodes.

344
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:23,756
They're only 2 minutes long.

345
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:27,820
You know, one day Ryan and I are going to
leave L.A. and then you'll all be sorry.

346
00:17:27,822 --> 00:17:32,124
'Cause you'll just be talking about
how you saw Jim Carrey at the dog park.

347
00:17:32,126 --> 00:17:35,949
Who saw Jim Carrey at the dog park?
Did you, did you see him, for real?

348
00:17:35,951 --> 00:17:37,226
I just made that up.

349
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:37,954
Oh.

350
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,412
I'm just saying that your whole lives
will be one big Howard Stern conversation.

351
00:17:41,414 --> 00:17:43,010
I love Howard Stern.

352
00:17:43,012 --> 00:17:44,040
Love him.

353
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:46,117
That's depressing.

354
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:48,278
This chicken is very good.

355
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:52,247
Oh, yeah. Lisa's a good little orderer.

356
00:17:55,987 --> 00:17:58,197
Um...

357
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:02,215
Did I tell you guys that I'm going
to London, with Josh and Trey?

358
00:18:02,217 --> 00:18:04,528
I thought you weren't going.

359
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:09,939
We did a spreadsheet on how much she'd spend
in London and how much she'd spend here...

360
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:14,102
and we think she'd spend more here.
Because there would be no controls.

361
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:17,367
Yeah, because women
are stupid spendthrifts.

362
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:19,122
It's just that you want more.

363
00:18:19,124 --> 00:18:23,168
They don't want more, they want everything.
They want to go to all the new restaurants...

364
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:28,924
they want all the best clothes, they want to take the best
vacations, they want to get all the best personal trainers...

365
00:18:28,926 --> 00:18:31,261
You don't like new restaurants?

366
00:18:31,263 --> 00:18:32,438
Well, yeah, but...

367
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,807
And you don't wanna take great vacations?

368
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:36,473
Well, yes, of course, but that's not...

369
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:37,721
We help you lead fuller lives.

370
00:18:37,723 --> 00:18:38,929
Yes.

371
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:40,089
Yeah.

372
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:45,504
Hey. So what's your script about?

373
00:18:45,506 --> 00:18:46,895
Ah, which one?

374
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:51,841
I was talking about the spec script that
you sold, but uh, how many do you have?

375
00:18:51,843 --> 00:18:56,100
Well, when that one went out, everyone
went nuts and wanted meetings with us...

376
00:18:56,102 --> 00:19:02,009
So, of course, we had this backlog
of ideas we wanted to pitch...

377
00:19:02,011 --> 00:19:07,295
So, we're working on an animated film at
Pixar, Spielberg wants to do a comedy...

378
00:19:07,297 --> 00:19:10,541
So, we're writing something for him, and...

379
00:19:10,543 --> 00:19:14,302
We're working on a project
we would direct ourselves.

380
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:18,303
Paramount would finance. Nothing huge,
but they want to be in business with us

381
00:19:18,305 --> 00:19:22,054
And, one of our TV episodes
was nominated for an Emmy.

382
00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:23,013
Oh, that's great.

383
00:19:23,015 --> 00:19:24,242
Congratulations.

384
00:19:24,244 --> 00:19:25,743
That's great news.

385
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:30,556
You know what? I'm going to go open one of the
bottles we brought. Anybody need anything else?

386
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:32,613
I'm going to get ours, too.

387
00:19:34,363 --> 00:19:36,113
I wanna read that spec script he sold.

388
00:19:36,115 --> 00:19:37,973
We should ask him.

389
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:42,317
Nah, because, he'll think that we have a chip on our
shoulder, that we just wanna see if it's good. I'm telling ya.

390
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:46,510
How could it be? Have you
seen his show? It's so hacky.

391
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,963
Eight hundred thousand dollars.

392
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:52,983
It's 'cause he's self-confident.
Confidence is everything in this town.

393
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,596
I'm self-confident, hanh?

394
00:19:55,896 --> 00:19:58,667
I got a two-bedroom
teardown in the Valley.

395
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:01,978
Yeah, but Studio City's cool.
It's not really the Valley.

396
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:08,735
Don't patronize me. Alright? When we trade
up, we'll move to the west side, alright?

397
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:16,150
We like the Valley, we're very middle-class. When I bought
Bree the Volvo, she acted like she'd won the lottery.

398
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,565
Must be nice to have a wife you can please.

399
00:20:19,895 --> 00:20:22,110
She's the best.

400
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,209
I have to do something about it...

401
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:27,170
It's humbling just to be nominated...

402
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:28,849
They have sticky things...

403
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:31,088
Right. And it might not happen again...

404
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:35,781
Bree? Bree? That's an unusual name.

405
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,045
Yeah, my mom had just seen "Klute."

406
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:42,354
Really? Your mom must be very
interesting, to name you after a hooker.

407
00:20:42,954 --> 00:20:47,111
I mean, um, uh, a prostitute.

408
00:20:48,051 --> 00:20:50,326
Is "Klute" good? I haven't seen that.

409
00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:53,650
Never seen "Klute"?!

410
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,943
So, how'd you two meet?

411
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:02,467
I was working on a film
that shot in Austin.

412
00:21:02,627 --> 00:21:04,283
Crew?

413
00:21:04,693 --> 00:21:06,349
No, no, I'm an actor.

414
00:21:06,351 --> 00:21:09,782
Mm. Big role? Small one?

415
00:21:09,842 --> 00:21:13,506
As actors, we're taught to believe
that there are no small roles.

416
00:21:13,508 --> 00:21:17,026
Right. So, small. What movie?

417
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:18,813
"Spaceman."

418
00:21:18,815 --> 00:21:20,938
Mm. I read the script.

419
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:28,701
Well. I read the first 10 pages. It was
actually so bad, I couldn't finish it.

420
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:32,954
How old are you?

421
00:21:32,956 --> 00:21:34,589
Twenty-six.

422
00:21:34,591 --> 00:21:35,938
That's young.

423
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:41,587
Yeah. He knows nothing about
the heartache of soft erections.

424
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,631
Wow.

425
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:50,121
Plus, everyone our age is married. So...

426
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:55,905
Yeah, but not all these marriages are going
to last. I mean, the divorce rate is 50%.

427
00:22:03,417 --> 00:22:07,468
My wife. Twelve years we've been together.

428
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:13,719
Yeah. And what's great about it is... and it kinda gets me
choked up a little bit... we're very supportive of each other.

429
00:22:13,721 --> 00:22:17,032
We look out for each other,
try to make each other happy.

430
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:22,735
Like, lately, she's been giving me
a lot of blow jobs. Which is awesome.

431
00:22:22,737 --> 00:22:30,020
And it's occurred to her that maybe blow jobs are
fattening, because she's been gaining a little weight.

432
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:39,385
The other day we're lying in bed and she says to me,
"Look, I'm thinking that maybe sperm has a lot of calories."

433
00:22:39,387 --> 00:22:42,313
So, I immediately go
into problem-solving mode.

434
00:22:42,315 --> 00:22:45,681
I'm like, "Why don't you
start skipping lunch?"

435
00:22:45,683 --> 00:22:47,420
That was mean.

436
00:22:47,422 --> 00:22:49,789
That's hilarious,
what're you talking about?

437
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:50,981
Funny, Ryan.

438
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:53,944
I'm just gonna play you guys
the first few notes, okay?

439
00:22:53,946 --> 00:22:55,963
Oh, hey, hey, hey...

440
00:22:55,965 --> 00:22:58,035
Thank you.

441
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:38,247
Did you guys get chills?

442
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:43,360
Are you serious?! How are you
guys not affected by that song?

443
00:23:43,362 --> 00:23:44,897
It was really beautiful, Bree.

444
00:23:44,899 --> 00:23:46,093
It was gorgeous.

445
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:47,328
Hey, you guys wanna play poker?

446
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,710
Yes!

447
00:23:48,712 --> 00:23:49,541
Yes.

448
00:23:49,543 --> 00:23:53,323
No. It's too late to start a game. It's
ten o'clock, we have to stop drinking.

449
00:23:53,325 --> 00:23:58,451
No. No one stop drinking. You guys have to spend
the night. Everyone should stay here, tonight.

450
00:23:58,611 --> 00:23:59,995
Really?

451
00:23:59,997 --> 00:24:02,561
Yeah. What's the point of
having this big house, right?

452
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:03,881
Alright.

453
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:05,475
Call your mom.

454
00:24:05,685 --> 00:24:08,580
It's been so long since
I've gotten shitfaced!

455
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:12,167
We can play poker all night,
and watch the sun rise...

456
00:24:12,169 --> 00:24:15,947
I feel alive. I'm alive, honey.

457
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,626
Stop feeling alive.

458
00:24:18,628 --> 00:24:20,795
I'm alive!

459
00:24:21,505 --> 00:24:24,292
Don't feel sorry for me.

460
00:24:24,294 --> 00:24:25,910
We don't feel sorry for you.

461
00:24:25,912 --> 00:24:27,863
We feel bad for you.

462
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:32,953
That's funny. Because I feel bad for you.

463
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:35,179
Why?!

464
00:24:35,543 --> 00:24:39,649
Well, neither of you
seem very happy right now.

465
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:41,449
Me and Michelle?

466
00:24:41,631 --> 00:24:44,614
Why are you singling us out?

467
00:24:45,024 --> 00:24:47,833
Ryan and Bree are happy.

468
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:51,761
Well... yeah... we're happy. But...

469
00:24:51,961 --> 00:24:54,909
What makes you think
Dave and I aren't happy?

470
00:24:55,469 --> 00:24:57,100
Seriously?

471
00:24:57,102 --> 00:25:01,850
Bree said earlier that you guys were like the
couple in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?".

472
00:25:01,852 --> 00:25:04,440
I mean, earlier, my
stomach hurt, so I was...

473
00:25:04,442 --> 00:25:05,707
Great, so everybody thinks we're a mess.

474
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:07,348
Oh, we don't think you're a mess...

475
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,694
Look, I get it. You've
got young kids. It's hard.

476
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:13,597
Josh and I are trying to get pregnant.

477
00:25:13,737 --> 00:25:16,197
Of course you are.

478
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:18,548
What does that mean?

479
00:25:18,568 --> 00:25:22,917
I just feel like we're all making
the same mistakes our parents made.

480
00:25:22,987 --> 00:25:27,134
You're on shaky ground so you
want to throw kids into the mix?

481
00:25:27,136 --> 00:25:30,455
You think I'm on shaky ground?

482
00:25:31,215 --> 00:25:39,029
You know how Josh acts like he's being funny because
he's smiling or making some sort of joke but...

483
00:25:39,031 --> 00:25:43,117
really he's just criticizing you?

484
00:25:43,277 --> 00:25:44,833
Yeah.

485
00:25:46,403 --> 00:25:50,300
It seems like he doesn't respect you.

486
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:58,098
Well... he has really high expectations
of everyone, himself included.

487
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,825
So, he's critical. But I
think that he respects me.

488
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:05,754
I know he respects me.

489
00:26:11,334 --> 00:26:14,471
That asshole. He doesn't respect me!

490
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,747
Well, maybe he does, I don't know?

491
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:19,971
No! No, he doesn't, I know he doesn't.

492
00:26:20,071 --> 00:26:24,026
Well, why don't you talk to him about it? If
you call him on it, he's gonna have to change.

493
00:26:24,028 --> 00:26:25,857
That's optimistic.

494
00:26:26,177 --> 00:26:32,833
I know you're into positive thinking and the power of intention
and all that shit, but sometimes it's just not realistic.

495
00:26:50,268 --> 00:26:51,733
What are you doing?

496
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,337
I'm gonna do a spreadsheet, to
see if I can afford to leave him.

497
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:56,682
Nooo! Wait, that was just my opinion.

498
00:26:56,684 --> 00:27:00,977
Hey, I could be totally wrong. Everybody
knows I'm a little screwed up right now.

499
00:27:00,979 --> 00:27:04,803
When we're done with her, let's do me. I
think I can get some money from my parents.

500
00:27:04,805 --> 00:27:06,845
You don't want to get a divorce.

501
00:27:06,847 --> 00:27:08,951
Yeah, you do not want to get a divorce.

502
00:27:08,953 --> 00:27:12,139
Dave and I are really
having problems right now.

503
00:27:12,141 --> 00:27:15,656
Listen, I get it, okay?
You love your kids...

504
00:27:15,658 --> 00:27:17,785
They're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

505
00:27:17,787 --> 00:27:21,400
But they're at an age where
they require constant attention.

506
00:27:21,402 --> 00:27:25,925
And it doesn't matter how much you love
them, there's a part of you that is angry.

507
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:29,001
Because you don't have a life anymore.

508
00:27:29,003 --> 00:27:33,601
I know. So you start taking it out on
the person closest to you... your spouse.

509
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:37,055
You know, I read this book
about how, in some cultures...

510
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:42,149
couples don't even pretend they can stay together
for the first 5 years of the child's life.

511
00:27:42,151 --> 00:27:45,603
So, the man... he leaves the home and
he goes and sleeps somewhere else...

512
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:50,112
and he just comes home to, you know, make repairs
to the thatched hut and give the wife money.

513
00:27:50,114 --> 00:27:55,884
And the woman... she gives all her attention to the child,
and her mother and sisters and aunts help her raise it.

514
00:27:56,334 --> 00:27:59,890
That's pretty smart. Most
American women, though,

515
00:27:59,892 --> 00:28:04,728
would not be okay with their husband sleeping with
another woman while we have to deal with the kids.

516
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:09,317
Dave can be really annoying.
He does all these little things.

517
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:12,360
Everybody does all these little things.

518
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:17,074
Look. I know he's a good person.
And I love him and I wish him well.

519
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:22,988
But what would be perfect is if we were
really rich and could have two houses...

520
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:26,234
so we could live near each
other but not together.

521
00:28:26,236 --> 00:28:29,930
Which would lead to divorce. Because why would you
be married to someone if you can live without them?

522
00:28:29,932 --> 00:28:36,116
Or, yeah, we'd get divorced. But we'd stay friends, and
I'd hire two nannies, so I could have round-the-clock help.

523
00:28:36,118 --> 00:28:41,311
Which would lead to you never seeing your kids.
So you'd feel guilty and you would indulge them...

524
00:28:41,313 --> 00:28:45,678
and then they would just be more and
more demanding and you'd all be miserable.

525
00:28:45,948 --> 00:28:48,573
I feel really overwhelmed.

526
00:28:50,443 --> 00:28:51,927
So, is this about the Emmy
thing you were talking about?

527
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:54,631
This guy, he's out of control.

528
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:55,620
He helped you with that?

529
00:28:55,622 --> 00:28:58,086
Yeah, he helped me. Makes all this money...

530
00:28:58,088 --> 00:29:00,954
When he signed the deal with
ABC, they backed the truck up.

531
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:07,009
Yeah, he is loaded. And now everyone's kissing
his ass. Actresses who audition for his show...

532
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:13,090
and there he is, stuck with his college sweetheart,
whom he thought was the best he was ever going to do.

533
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:14,344
She's cute.

534
00:29:14,346 --> 00:29:18,719
Yeah, but she's not beautiful. I
mean, he could have his pick now.

535
00:29:18,979 --> 00:29:22,899
Yeah, but do you really wanna be with someone
who's only with you because you have money?

536
00:29:22,901 --> 00:29:28,740
A young guy's perspective. Probably when we're that old,
we'll settle for getting a beautiful woman any way we can.

537
00:29:28,742 --> 00:29:31,584
What're you talking about? Are
you planning on being single?

538
00:29:31,586 --> 00:29:33,798
Hey. It's touch-and-go
at my house.

539
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,816
It's great being young, huh? The women
are more fun? Easier to please, I guess.

540
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:42,445
That's what makes them not fun. Women
your age, they're harder to satisfy.

541
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,283
I guess I like the challenge.

542
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:50,077
You just have to get through
the next couple of years.

543
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,869
The kids will get easier.

544
00:29:51,871 --> 00:29:56,590
And in the meantime, you have to remember
why you married Dave to begin with.

545
00:29:56,592 --> 00:30:01,313
And yes... you have to make
yourself have sex with him.

546
00:30:01,473 --> 00:30:05,565
No. I have nooo desire. None.

547
00:30:05,575 --> 00:30:07,753
We don't have sex either.

548
00:30:07,823 --> 00:30:11,201
I just don't care about it. At all.

549
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:16,295
Okay. Well, it will be
your problem eventually.

550
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:22,435
I mean, you can't tell a guy, "Hey, we're married,
and you can never have sex with anyone else again."

551
00:30:22,437 --> 00:30:26,195
"Oh, and by the way, you can
never have sex with me again."

552
00:30:26,197 --> 00:30:29,853
I mean, eventually he's going to
decide that that's a bunch of bullshit

553
00:30:29,855 --> 00:30:33,271
and he's gonna find somebody
else to have sex with.

554
00:30:33,273 --> 00:30:35,581
The oppressed will rise up.

555
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,517
Is that what happened with you and Chris?

556
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:40,199
Do you think he was justified
in having the affair?

557
00:30:40,201 --> 00:30:41,598
No.

558
00:30:41,928 --> 00:30:45,133
At least, I would never tell him that.

559
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:51,051
But yeah, we didn't have sex. I
just, I just didn't feel like it.

560
00:30:51,053 --> 00:30:53,340
But he's so good-looking.

561
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,443
I'm just saying...

562
00:30:57,445 --> 00:31:00,456
I mean, if she didn't feel
like having sex with Chris...

563
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,539
how am I supposed to feel
like having sex with Dave?

564
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:04,904
That's so mean!

565
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:11,650
What? It's just sometimes I look at
him and he already seems middle-aged.

566
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:16,461
Well, we almost are. It's not that far off.

567
00:31:16,463 --> 00:31:20,021
Actually, I read this
book by Desmond Morris...

568
00:31:20,023 --> 00:31:23,481
that says men's waists
expand as they get older...

569
00:31:23,483 --> 00:31:26,889
and their shoulders get
more narrow and rounded...

570
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:29,648
and this is all part of
nature's grand plan...

571
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:32,679
so that they will be less
attractive to other women...

572
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:35,602
so that they will stay with their
wives and help raise the children.

573
00:31:35,902 --> 00:31:38,674
How do you find time to read all this shit?

574
00:31:39,224 --> 00:31:40,885
Dave is awesome.

575
00:31:40,887 --> 00:31:42,737
I find him very attractive.

576
00:31:42,739 --> 00:31:45,301
I love Dave. He's... he's great.

577
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,167
He would freak if he heard this.

578
00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:48,532
You should tell him.

579
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:51,093
Yeah, why don't you, if
it'd give him a boost?

580
00:31:51,095 --> 00:31:52,396
No.

581
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:53,821
Why?

582
00:31:53,861 --> 00:31:58,015
Because. I don't want to give him power.

583
00:31:58,017 --> 00:31:59,752
- Michelle!
- Ohh!

584
00:31:59,754 --> 00:32:01,029
What?

585
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:02,539
Okay, that's bitchy.

586
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,797
I guess I'm in a bad place right now.

587
00:32:06,567 --> 00:32:07,881
Yeah.

588
00:32:07,883 --> 00:32:09,587
Obviously I am, too.

589
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:14,775
Why else would I be hanging out
with a 26-year-old actor in Malibu?

590
00:32:14,777 --> 00:32:16,741
I love Malibu.

591
00:32:16,743 --> 00:32:19,446
Tell us about the sex. With the actor.

592
00:32:19,448 --> 00:32:22,514
No, you do not get to
ask questions about sex.

593
00:32:22,516 --> 00:32:23,769
Why not?

594
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:26,108
Because you're not willing to
reveal anything about yourself.

595
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,958
I will tell you anything you
want to know about my sex life.

596
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,053
Yeah. You and Ryan have good sex. We know.

597
00:32:33,055 --> 00:32:36,053
I'm saying you won't talk
about other guys, ever.

598
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:39,186
Like, you won't even admit
it if somebody else is hot.

599
00:32:39,188 --> 00:32:41,249
It's as if that's cheating on Ryan.

600
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:42,224
I know it's not cheating.

601
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:43,526
Of course it's not!

602
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:45,831
But, it's a little bit of a betrayal.

603
00:32:45,871 --> 00:32:48,309
How is it a betrayal?!

604
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:52,229
Obviously, George Clooney
was hot in "The American."

605
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:57,241
Okay? And it probably wouldn't be
unpleasant to have sex with him.

606
00:32:57,243 --> 00:32:59,849
Everybody knows that, including Ryan.

607
00:32:59,851 --> 00:33:04,067
So, I just don't think it's a big deal to
acknowledge what everybody else knows to be true.

608
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:05,897
Was that good, "The American"?
We didn't see that one.

609
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:08,804
How does Josh write movies
when he's never seen one?

610
00:33:08,806 --> 00:33:11,233
We see movies all the time.

611
00:33:11,235 --> 00:33:14,013
But you just studiously
avoid the good ones?

612
00:33:14,015 --> 00:33:18,702
Just because we don't see the kind of
movies you see... you're a snob, Bree.

613
00:33:18,922 --> 00:33:21,713
Am I? Or are you people just disappointing?

614
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:23,091
Jon Stewart.

615
00:33:23,093 --> 00:33:24,283
He's great.

616
00:33:24,285 --> 00:33:26,549
Yeah, I know he's great but do you ever
think it'd be fun to have sex with him?

617
00:33:26,551 --> 00:33:28,389
Michelle.

618
00:33:28,391 --> 00:33:29,440
Jason Bateman!

619
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:32,570
No, stop, I'm going to break her.

620
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:40,534
Matt Damon. In "The Bourne Identity."
When he's washing Franke Potente's hair.

621
00:33:40,536 --> 00:33:42,307
She's cute!

622
00:33:43,387 --> 00:33:48,893
He can kill anyone with his bare hands. But
he's a good person, and he barely ever speaks...

623
00:33:48,895 --> 00:33:53,913
which is so hot. And when he
does, he says the perfect thing.

624
00:33:54,103 --> 00:33:56,731
He's got very good dialogue.

625
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:58,524
Tony Gilroy wrote it.

626
00:33:58,526 --> 00:34:01,572
No, don't do that. This is not
a discussion of the script, 'kay.

627
00:34:01,574 --> 00:34:06,009
I'm saying, Matt Damon in all the
Bourne movies is hot as hell...

628
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:07,986
and you know you've thought
about having sex with him...

629
00:34:07,988 --> 00:34:10,176
and I demand that you admit it!

630
00:34:11,436 --> 00:34:13,256
C'mon, just admit it!

631
00:34:13,258 --> 00:34:16,378
I will happily admit that I
want to have sex with other guys.

632
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,090
Every person in a relationship
wants to have sex with other people.

633
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:23,132
So what! Who cares? It's human nature!

634
00:34:23,134 --> 00:34:27,484
I think we can assume she
finds other guys attractive.

635
00:34:28,094 --> 00:34:30,709
I'll reveal something personal.

636
00:34:30,849 --> 00:34:34,560
When Ryan and I have sex,
I can't look into his eyes.

637
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:38,171
At least not for more
than a couple of seconds.

638
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,883
It's like it's too intimate or something.

639
00:34:46,973 --> 00:34:49,098
Let's get donuts.

640
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,291
Just put off getting married for as
long as you can, that's all we're saying.

641
00:34:52,293 --> 00:34:55,361
Well, no, get married whenever you
want, just, you know, choose wisely.

642
00:34:55,363 --> 00:34:58,499
Oh, no shit. Choose as if
your life depended on it.

643
00:34:58,501 --> 00:35:00,699
You're not thinking about that now, right?

644
00:35:00,701 --> 00:35:01,869
Marriage?

645
00:35:01,871 --> 00:35:04,447
No. No. You know, I'm...

646
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:06,923
Twenty-six.

647
00:35:07,393 --> 00:35:08,989
This fucking guy, huh?

648
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:10,131
Oh, I know, right?

649
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:12,011
I would kill to be 26 again.

650
00:35:12,013 --> 00:35:15,753
I wouldn't screw it up this time.
I'd show everybody how it's done.

651
00:35:16,603 --> 00:35:18,032
What is that dance?

652
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:19,570
It's the 'how you do it' dance.

653
00:35:20,508 --> 00:35:22,496
Did you get your medicine today, or no?

654
00:35:28,512 --> 00:35:31,519
Look at all these cool people.

655
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:38,338
I never meet anyone. I'm always cooped up
in that stupid house or running errands.

656
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,185
Your house is awesome.

657
00:35:40,465 --> 00:35:42,400
You should be grateful.

658
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,940
I know. You're right.

659
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,664
We're all really blessed.

660
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:51,156
I know. We are really, really fortunate.

661
00:35:52,876 --> 00:35:55,053
You see that guy?

662
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:56,478
Yeah.

663
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:57,776
I'd fuck him.

664
00:35:58,116 --> 00:35:59,260
Really?

665
00:35:59,262 --> 00:36:00,654
Yep.

666
00:36:00,944 --> 00:36:03,260
You know who I think is hot?

667
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,904
Brad.

668
00:36:04,906 --> 00:36:06,002
I know.

669
00:36:07,217 --> 00:36:11,670
Ginger is so lucky. I mean, she's not
lucky, she's getting a divorce, but...

670
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:15,727
Ah... Chris is so good-looking...

671
00:36:15,729 --> 00:36:18,158
and now she gets to have sex with Brad.

672
00:36:18,308 --> 00:36:21,887
Do you ever wish you could just put
your marriage on hold for a little while?

673
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:27,070
Be single again, you know, just for a
little bit, then go back to being married.

674
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,800
Probably nobody would go back.

675
00:36:29,802 --> 00:36:35,669
I just miss feeling excited,
about anything, you know?

676
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:40,898
When you meet somebody new,
it's so exciting, those feelings.

677
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,904
It's like when you were in high school...

678
00:36:42,906 --> 00:36:44,915
and you would be going to a party...

679
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:48,746
and you didn't know if a guy that
you liked was going to be there but...

680
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:54,538
...you just didn't know what was going to happen.
Would you get to talk to him, would you get to make out?

681
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,748
We used to play Seven Minutes in Heaven.

682
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:00,129
We never did that! I'm so bummed!

683
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:02,202
It was awesome.

684
00:37:09,082 --> 00:37:11,101
Hey, you guys?

685
00:37:11,441 --> 00:37:12,654
Yeah?

686
00:37:12,656 --> 00:37:16,058
I have an idea, but, uh,
Bree, you're not gonna approve.

687
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,684
Yeah?

688
00:37:17,686 --> 00:37:21,427
When we get back to the house, let's tell the
guys we want to play Seven Minutes in Heaven.

689
00:37:23,389 --> 00:37:25,534
Wait. You mean the game
where you go in the...

690
00:37:25,536 --> 00:37:27,144
Yes!

691
00:37:27,374 --> 00:37:29,017
Okay.

692
00:37:29,127 --> 00:37:30,170
Yes!

693
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,947
Seriously?

694
00:37:35,077 --> 00:37:36,538
We have an idea.

695
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,025
It's kind of unorthodox.

696
00:37:38,027 --> 00:37:39,749
Unorthodox. Where'd you get that?

697
00:37:39,751 --> 00:37:41,228
What do you mean?

698
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,895
I've never heard you use that word before.

699
00:37:42,897 --> 00:37:46,107
I read books, Josh! More than
you do, and you're a writer!

700
00:37:46,627 --> 00:37:49,661
We want to play Seven Minutes in Heaven.

701
00:37:50,021 --> 00:37:51,237
What's that?

702
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,174
Isn't that the thing where you...

703
00:37:52,176 --> 00:37:55,031
It's a game where two people go in a
closet and make out for seven minutes.

704
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:58,588
Okay, but... I can make out
with you anytime I want to,

705
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,486
and I don't have to go in a closet

706
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:03,136
and I don't have to do it
for the full seven minutes.

707
00:38:04,605 --> 00:38:10,195
I'm not talking about spouses with spouses.
We're talking about random pairings.

708
00:38:11,585 --> 00:38:13,595
What the hell are you talking about?

709
00:38:13,835 --> 00:38:16,992
Seven Minutes in Heaven!

710
00:38:17,412 --> 00:38:19,449
You wanna play this game?

711
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:21,656
Seven Minutes in the Closet?

712
00:38:22,236 --> 00:38:23,402
Seven Minutes in Heaven.

713
00:38:23,404 --> 00:38:24,572
Whatever.

714
00:38:24,574 --> 00:38:26,327
No. Do you?

715
00:38:26,329 --> 00:38:28,562
No. Hell no. These people are nuts.

716
00:38:28,564 --> 00:38:31,618
I know, I know. Apparently we're boring.

717
00:38:33,048 --> 00:38:34,483
You wanna play?!

718
00:38:34,485 --> 00:38:36,295
No! Do you?!

719
00:38:36,297 --> 00:38:37,904
No!

720
00:38:38,744 --> 00:38:42,880
Michelle thinks we're fearful
and naive. We're not adventurous.

721
00:38:42,882 --> 00:38:46,306
Being adventurous is, like, riding
a motorcycle across South America...

722
00:38:46,308 --> 00:38:48,535
that's adventurous.

723
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:52,022
Letting another guy make out
with your wife... that's stupid.

724
00:38:52,322 --> 00:38:53,510
Wikipedia.

725
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:01,029
Seven Minutes in Heaven is a kissing
game first played by teenagers

726
00:39:01,031 --> 00:39:03,210
in Cincinnati in the early 1950s.

727
00:39:03,212 --> 00:39:07,111
See? Midwesterners know how to party
because their winters are so long.

728
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:12,607
Two people selected go into a closet
or another dark enclosed space...

729
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:15,137
and do whatever they
like for seven minutes.

730
00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:16,657
Mm-hm.

731
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:18,309
This is what you wanna do?

732
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:19,766
Yeah.

733
00:39:19,768 --> 00:39:21,576
So, are you guys in?

734
00:39:22,046 --> 00:39:24,325
No./Okay./No./Yes.

735
00:39:24,455 --> 00:39:26,421
Okay./No./Okay./No.

736
00:39:30,171 --> 00:39:33,668
If we did this, you'd regret
it and you'd be jealous...

737
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:36,729
and I'd hear about it til the day I die.

738
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:38,969
Don't flatter yourself.

739
00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:42,072
O-kay. Okay.

740
00:39:42,102 --> 00:39:45,165
I'm in. What about you two? Are you in?

741
00:39:45,325 --> 00:39:45,947
No.

742
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:46,871
No.

743
00:39:46,873 --> 00:39:50,009
C'mon. Either we all do
it or none of us plays.

744
00:39:50,011 --> 00:39:51,070
We're not gonna play.

745
00:39:51,072 --> 00:39:52,266
We're not going to play.

746
00:39:52,268 --> 00:39:54,028
Unh...

747
00:39:54,168 --> 00:39:55,817
So, should we still play?

748
00:39:55,819 --> 00:39:56,788
Yeah.

749
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,681
Yeah.

750
00:39:58,683 --> 00:40:00,945
Can I talk to you for a second?

751
00:40:00,947 --> 00:40:02,693
O-kay.

752
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:04,770
You're in trouble.

753
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,484
Look at that view.

754
00:40:21,554 --> 00:40:23,122
I want a pool.

755
00:40:23,124 --> 00:40:24,603
Are you crazy?

756
00:40:24,605 --> 00:40:28,066
I just wanna do something
different. Unpredictable.

757
00:40:28,068 --> 00:40:30,132
Every day I wake up and
I do the exact same thing.

758
00:40:30,134 --> 00:40:33,638
I try to get some writing done
but mostly I just change diapers...

759
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,321
and clean up after the kids and straighten
up the house and feed the kids...

760
00:40:38,323 --> 00:40:41,756
and read 'em a bedtime story and then
spend hours trying to put Chloe to sleep...

761
00:40:41,758 --> 00:40:46,551
and then I wake up the next day and do the
exact same thing except maybe I go to Target.

762
00:40:46,553 --> 00:40:51,517
If I seriously stopped to think about
what my life has become, I would freak out.

763
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:52,919
You wanted kids.

764
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:57,109
Dave, I love Emma and Chloe. They're the
best thing that ever happened to me...

765
00:40:57,111 --> 00:41:00,357
Stop saying that. Obviously
you don't really feel that way.

766
00:41:01,197 --> 00:41:05,146
If you think for a second that I
don't adore them, then you're crazy.

767
00:41:05,148 --> 00:41:07,427
Why else would I do everything for them?

768
00:41:07,429 --> 00:41:09,662
Then why can't you do
everything for them happily?

769
00:41:09,664 --> 00:41:12,582
You have to complain about
it every step of the way.

770
00:41:12,584 --> 00:41:15,492
Why can't you be one of those
women that's, just, you know, happy?

771
00:41:15,494 --> 00:41:16,783
Because it's hard!

772
00:41:16,785 --> 00:41:19,972
No, it isn't. You just decide you're
going to be happy and then you do it!

773
00:41:19,974 --> 00:41:23,231
You know? Sometimes a person
just has to have self-control.

774
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:26,050
It's not like you're Mr. Sunshine,
walking around all cheerful.

775
00:41:26,052 --> 00:41:28,615
Because my wife is always dissatisfied.

776
00:41:28,617 --> 00:41:31,402
It's human nature to want more.

777
00:41:34,402 --> 00:41:38,352
I'm not sexist, you know I'm not,
but I think this is a gender thing.

778
00:41:38,354 --> 00:41:41,146
Women always want more.

779
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:44,810
Well, I can think of one
thing men always want more of.

780
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,446
Sex.

781
00:41:46,448 --> 00:41:48,030
And now here's your chance.

782
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,780
What, we're gonna have
sex with these people?

783
00:41:49,782 --> 00:41:51,012
It's a kissing game.

784
00:41:51,122 --> 00:41:53,106
Why can't we play Cranium?

785
00:41:53,108 --> 00:41:55,880
Dave. This is your chance
to make out with someone.

786
00:41:55,882 --> 00:41:58,110
It's YOUR chance to make out with someone.

787
00:41:58,112 --> 00:41:59,628
What do you care?!

788
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:02,496
I walk around with food in my
teeth and you don't even tell me...

789
00:42:02,498 --> 00:42:05,944
because you don't notice because
you don't even look at me!

790
00:42:05,946 --> 00:42:09,864
Remember when I got my hair cut and you didn't notice
but you noticed when you got the credit card bill?

791
00:42:09,866 --> 00:42:11,589
Because it was two hundred dollars!

792
00:42:11,591 --> 00:42:12,790
I know!

793
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,627
I think we have problems.

794
00:42:17,629 --> 00:42:19,705
Everybody has problems.

795
00:42:19,707 --> 00:42:21,606
Ryan and Bree are happy.

796
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:23,282
They don't have kids.

797
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,762
You wanted kids!

798
00:42:24,764 --> 00:42:27,591
I'm just saying their life is one
continuous round of pleasure...

799
00:42:27,593 --> 00:42:32,049
restaurants, movies, reading every issue
of the New Yorker from cover to cover.

800
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:36,115
It's actually a pretty selfish existence.

801
00:42:37,135 --> 00:42:39,120
We had problems before we had kids.

802
00:42:39,122 --> 00:42:40,401
No.

803
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:47,025
Yeah. Well.

804
00:42:54,635 --> 00:42:56,989
If you don't want to play Seven
Minutes in Heaven, we won't.

805
00:42:57,059 --> 00:42:59,781
God, that name... it's so corny.

806
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:03,131
Of course Ryan and Bree aren't playing.

807
00:43:03,133 --> 00:43:04,468
So?

808
00:43:04,718 --> 00:43:06,913
Everybody else is game.

809
00:43:15,153 --> 00:43:16,990
Right.

810
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:24,659
Well? Are you in?

811
00:43:24,889 --> 00:43:26,239
She wants to, so...

812
00:43:26,529 --> 00:43:27,822
Fun!

813
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:33,418
Alright, my lawyer says it'll be valid because
we'd all be witnesses to each other's signatures.

814
00:43:34,238 --> 00:43:35,616
What?

815
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:39,821
I printed a limited liability
agreement from the Net.

816
00:43:39,823 --> 00:43:42,499
It's a boilerplate agreement,
so I had to add some wording...

817
00:43:42,501 --> 00:43:46,337
but basically we're agreeing to not
talk about the game after tonight.

818
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:50,027
So that, you know, no one
fights about it afterward.

819
00:43:50,029 --> 00:43:52,520
And we can't discuss it publicly, either.

820
00:43:52,522 --> 00:43:55,658
Well, good. Because I don't want
anybody thinking we're swingers.

821
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,011
Yeah. It could have a
negative effect on my career.

822
00:43:59,171 --> 00:44:02,222
Well, all of our careers.
We all have careers, so...

823
00:44:02,452 --> 00:44:05,352
Of course. Well, everyone except for Lisa.

824
00:44:05,354 --> 00:44:08,353
I work. I run this household.

825
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:13,540
If by 'run this household' you mean
calling the maid and ordering take-out.

826
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:16,321
Don't talk to me like that.

827
00:44:17,101 --> 00:44:21,937
Lisa, c'mon. It's not like you're
actually doing all the work yourself...

828
00:44:21,939 --> 00:44:24,695
cleaning the house, the
pool, doing the landscaping.

829
00:44:24,697 --> 00:44:32,363
I coordinate everything. I pay the bills and run the
errands, so that you can work 24/7. I make your life possible.

830
00:44:32,365 --> 00:44:36,012
Oh, wow, like that's a
privilege. I get to work 24/7.

831
00:44:36,014 --> 00:44:37,870
You love working.

832
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:43,290
I have to go to the well while I
can. This could all change overnight.

833
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:49,650
Yeah, I'm the hot writer now. But
that can't last forever, right?

834
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,340
Okay. Yes. I love to work.

835
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:04,780
I'm sorry. You're right.
You make my life possible.

836
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,038
Thank you.

837
00:45:12,188 --> 00:45:14,206
Which closet are we going to use?

838
00:45:16,378 --> 00:45:18,760
Where does this even go?

839
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:30,802
Ahhh!

840
00:45:31,382 --> 00:45:33,325
I'll be the deejay.

841
00:45:34,085 --> 00:45:36,243
Bryan Ferry.

842
00:45:36,283 --> 00:45:38,301
Too obvious?

843
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:41,289
Who would you want to be matched with?

844
00:45:41,291 --> 00:45:42,206
What do you mean?

845
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:43,467
If we played.

846
00:45:45,217 --> 00:45:46,404
You want to play.

847
00:45:46,406 --> 00:45:48,986
Nah, I'm just saying, if we did,
who would you want to be paired with?

848
00:45:48,988 --> 00:45:51,610
No one. Who would you
want to be paired with?

849
00:45:51,612 --> 00:45:52,706
No one.

850
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:57,605
Why'd you ask me that? Obviously you've
thought about who you'd want to be paired with.

851
00:45:57,607 --> 00:46:00,330
No, I was thinking that
maybe it was on your mind.

852
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:02,690
Well, if we're going to argue,
then we might as well play.

853
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:04,357
You wanna play.

854
00:46:04,647 --> 00:46:07,804
No. Do you?

855
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:10,091
No.

856
00:46:27,517 --> 00:46:31,221
I don't know. Bad feng shui.

857
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:34,797
I know you find Lisa attractive.

858
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:35,895
No...

859
00:46:35,897 --> 00:46:37,907
Maybe not her face, but her breasts.

860
00:46:37,909 --> 00:46:39,838
No, I don't.

861
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:41,288
Liar.

862
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:42,189
Bree, I mean...

863
00:46:42,191 --> 00:46:45,920
No, look, look... you have to
lie. I mean, you have no choice.

864
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:49,141
What're you going to say,
'Yeah, she's got great tits'?

865
00:46:49,143 --> 00:46:52,874
You can't say that. So,
you lie. To keep the peace.

866
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:56,849
See? Everything's based on
a foundation of bullshit.

867
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,293
That's so depressing.

868
00:47:00,295 --> 00:47:02,969
We should just be honest.

869
00:47:02,971 --> 00:47:06,697
Okay. You first.

870
00:47:07,187 --> 00:47:08,944
Okay.

871
00:47:12,104 --> 00:47:17,232
Yes. Lisa has nice breasts.
But you know they're gonna sag.

872
00:47:17,492 --> 00:47:20,368
And yours are gonna stay
nice and perfect-looking.

873
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,476
Yeah, because they're smaller.

874
00:47:22,478 --> 00:47:25,619
Hers are huge.

875
00:47:28,499 --> 00:47:31,801
Okay? Now you say something honest.

876
00:47:31,861 --> 00:47:36,557
Be honest about something.

877
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:43,130
Alright, this is not a big deal. I mean, it's
silly, because he's famous and unattainable, but...

878
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,721
I find Matt Damon attractive.

879
00:47:47,961 --> 00:47:49,762
Matt Damon?

880
00:47:49,764 --> 00:47:52,300
He's not unattainable.
You could totally get him.

881
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:55,880
Ryan, he's married. And his
wife seems really lovely.

882
00:47:55,882 --> 00:48:02,042
Why do people use that word, 'lovely'? It's so
pretentious. Like, what are we, British or something? Huh?

883
00:48:02,044 --> 00:48:05,054
I guarantee if Matt Damon met
you, he'd be attracted to you.

884
00:48:05,056 --> 00:48:10,858
No, he wouldn't, okay? And that's part of why I like him,
you know? I feel like he's a nice guy. He's got integrity.

885
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:14,524
Oh, boy, you've really thought a
lot about this, haven't you, huh?

886
00:48:14,526 --> 00:48:17,425
Matt Damon? I mean, he's not even funny.

887
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:19,580
Yeah, remember when he
was on "Will and Grace"?

888
00:48:19,582 --> 00:48:25,123
You fucking remember that? I mean, you've
really been into him for a while, haven't you?

889
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:29,084
I'm not going to argue with you about this. If we're
going to argue, then let's go play Seven Minutes in Heaven.

890
00:48:29,086 --> 00:48:30,857
If you want to fucking play,
then let's fucking play!

891
00:48:30,947 --> 00:48:32,598
I don't want to play!

892
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,972
Of course you don't wanna
play. Not with these slobs.

893
00:48:34,974 --> 00:48:38,406
They're no temptation to you. Not
when you're obsessed with Matt Damon.

894
00:48:38,408 --> 00:48:39,540
Oh my God.

895
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:42,388
I mean, I don't know how I'm going
to find time to get washboard abs...

896
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:46,476
when I'm busy trying to work my
ass off, to build a comedy career.

897
00:48:46,478 --> 00:48:49,792
I mean, who knows what will
happen, when you run into Damon...

898
00:48:49,794 --> 00:48:55,738
while I'm out, flying all over creation, performing
in clubs, to try to pay for our fucking house!

899
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,534
This is insane. I'm not going
to leave you for Matt Damon.

900
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:08,317
You think he'd be faithful to you? Huh? A fucking actor?
They fall in and out of love like kids at summer camp, huh?

901
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:13,322
Ya really think he's gonna be into you,
when you get old and your breasts sag?

902
00:49:19,322 --> 00:49:21,018
What do you think?

903
00:49:21,278 --> 00:49:23,425
This is perfect.

904
00:49:27,285 --> 00:49:29,795
So, we can use these to draw names.

905
00:49:29,797 --> 00:49:34,045
Oh, here, I'll do it. So, Ryan
thinks you have nice breasts.

906
00:49:37,305 --> 00:49:39,145
Thanks.

907
00:49:39,615 --> 00:49:41,717
No problem.

908
00:49:43,869 --> 00:49:46,284
Real original.

909
00:49:54,744 --> 00:49:56,668
Well, here we go.

910
00:49:58,468 --> 00:50:00,437
Okay, you guys ready to play?

911
00:50:00,439 --> 00:50:02,589
I didn't know married
people did stuff like this.

912
00:50:02,591 --> 00:50:03,836
They don't.

913
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:06,558
You don't know that. We don't
know what other married people do.

914
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:10,393
Well, we're short one girl. So,
someone's gonna have to go twice.

915
00:50:10,663 --> 00:50:14,457
Me. If you have two kids, you go twice.

916
00:50:16,188 --> 00:50:18,712
No one picks their own spouse.

917
00:50:18,714 --> 00:50:20,816
There's gotta be a more efficient way
to do this, like a mathematical way.

918
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:24,339
Too bad we're all writers,
we'll never find out.

919
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:31,107
Lisa.

920
00:50:31,109 --> 00:50:33,225
Ooooh.

921
00:50:35,895 --> 00:50:37,749
That's your wife.

922
00:50:37,751 --> 00:50:39,398
Yeah, please. Fill 'er up.

923
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,929
Can I get a drink?

924
00:50:40,931 --> 00:50:43,279
Have fun.

925
00:50:46,829 --> 00:50:48,718
I love how you're smiling.

926
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,207
I don't care.

927
00:50:50,209 --> 00:50:51,672
You don't care?

928
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:53,270
I don't.

929
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,381
Think this is a test?
Like, they're testing us?

930
00:51:06,383 --> 00:51:09,807
Here, we're going first, 'cause they wanna
see if we're actually gonna do something.

931
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:11,413
Then they'll just, like, crucify us.

932
00:51:11,415 --> 00:51:13,931
No. Mm-mm.

933
00:51:15,231 --> 00:51:17,149
This wood paneling is nice.

934
00:51:17,151 --> 00:51:21,272
Yeah, I know. It's
original, it's from the '50s.

935
00:51:21,482 --> 00:51:24,694
Josh wanted to redo it, because
he likes everything so perfect.

936
00:51:24,696 --> 00:51:28,028
He prides himself on being a perfectionist.

937
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:32,481
You know what's funny? My mom is a
human resources manager for a hospital...

938
00:51:32,483 --> 00:51:36,325
So, she's a real student of human
nature... do I sound like a geek?

939
00:51:36,327 --> 00:51:37,729
No. No.

940
00:51:38,139 --> 00:51:42,490
Anyway. So. When she interviews someone,
and they say that they're a perfectionist,

941
00:51:42,492 --> 00:51:47,376
she doesn't buy it. She says true
perfectionists are so demanding of themselves...

942
00:51:47,378 --> 00:51:50,542
they don't think of themselves
as anywhere near perfect.

943
00:51:50,544 --> 00:51:55,118
They think that everything they do is so far from
perfection that they couldn't possibly be a perfectionist.

944
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,485
I love that.

945
00:51:56,487 --> 00:51:59,136
So. I don't think Josh is a perfectionist.

946
00:51:59,138 --> 00:52:01,637
You ever read his scripts,
when he finishes them?

947
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:02,879
Always.

948
00:52:02,881 --> 00:52:04,778
Do they have any typos?

949
00:52:04,938 --> 00:52:06,279
Tons!

950
00:52:06,281 --> 00:52:08,315
I rest my case.

951
00:52:08,317 --> 00:52:15,858
I sound like an old person. Next thing you know I'll be
saying 'gams' instead of legs. 'Look at the gams on her!'

952
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,570
You're so funny.

953
00:52:17,572 --> 00:52:19,019
Really?

954
00:52:19,449 --> 00:52:23,757
Yeah. Michelle doesn't tell
you that very often, huh?

955
00:52:23,759 --> 00:52:26,647
It's extremely rare. It's
part of her winning formula.

956
00:52:26,649 --> 00:52:30,395
She hardly ever throws you a bone, so when she
does, you feel like you're the king of the world.

957
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,645
Omigod, now I'm James Cameron.

958
00:52:33,125 --> 00:52:36,403
He's not such a bad guy.

959
00:52:36,405 --> 00:52:40,080
Josh hardly ever compliments me either.

960
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:46,288
It's 'cause they're insecure. Really insecure
people never give compliments. They can't afford to.

961
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:48,638
You're right.

962
00:52:49,388 --> 00:52:54,453
You're so smart and funny
and... god, Michelle's lucky.

963
00:52:54,455 --> 00:52:57,792
You're such a man, you
know? You're such a... guy.

964
00:52:58,522 --> 00:53:03,004
Oh my god, it feels so good to get
compliments from a beautiful girl.

965
00:53:03,006 --> 00:53:06,738
I wish beautiful girls would give me
compliments all the time, you know?

966
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,772
Is it wrong to want that?

967
00:53:08,774 --> 00:53:10,099
No.

968
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:13,879
You think I'm beautiful?

969
00:53:15,379 --> 00:53:16,863
Of course.

970
00:53:21,423 --> 00:53:23,876
Should we make out?

971
00:53:24,096 --> 00:53:28,010
Maybe. I don't know if this whole
marriage thing is going to work out, so...

972
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,188
I'll probably give it a go.

973
00:53:32,628 --> 00:53:34,439
You're really funny.

974
00:53:34,441 --> 00:53:38,774
Keep saying that and I will leave her.
I'm serious. I will do it. Right now.

975
00:53:38,776 --> 00:53:41,546
You're so funny.

976
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:03,706
"Time's up! Time's up!"

977
00:54:03,796 --> 00:54:06,517
Omigod, why did we waste time talking?

978
00:54:13,407 --> 00:54:18,483
"Time's up!!!"

979
00:54:19,941 --> 00:54:23,268
This, uh, contract is not
going to prevent arguments.

980
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:24,745
I know.

981
00:54:24,747 --> 00:54:26,432
Do I have any lipstick on me?

982
00:54:26,434 --> 00:54:27,384
You're good.

983
00:54:27,386 --> 00:54:28,709
Thank you.

984
00:54:28,711 --> 00:54:30,571
Time's up!

985
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,316
What?

986
00:54:40,456 --> 00:54:42,282
Did you do anything?

987
00:54:45,212 --> 00:54:47,192
Tsk. You didn't do anything.

988
00:54:47,194 --> 00:54:50,444
I thought we weren't discussing
it. We signed the contract.

989
00:54:52,604 --> 00:54:54,533
You didn't do anything?

990
00:54:54,535 --> 00:54:57,009
We signed the contract.

991
00:54:57,011 --> 00:54:59,732
Okay. We're honoring the contract.

992
00:55:06,362 --> 00:55:07,451
Ginger.

993
00:55:08,061 --> 00:55:09,313
Oh, boy.

994
00:55:09,793 --> 00:55:11,549
Okaay.

995
00:55:12,619 --> 00:55:15,531
Alrighty, sir...

996
00:55:15,533 --> 00:55:16,945
M'lady...

997
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:18,273
Don't hurt nobody.

998
00:55:18,275 --> 00:55:19,833
Excuse me, Brad.

999
00:55:28,613 --> 00:55:30,479
This is a little weird, huh?

1000
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:31,929
Yeah.

1001
00:55:59,454 --> 00:56:01,468
What's wrong?

1002
00:56:06,538 --> 00:56:10,373
Should I go get someone?
One of the girls? Or...?

1003
00:56:11,133 --> 00:56:13,729
Is this about Chris?

1004
00:56:17,429 --> 00:56:19,498
It's everything.

1005
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:30,610
Aw, I'm sorry. I'm ruining this for you.

1006
00:56:30,612 --> 00:56:33,408
No, no, please.

1007
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:37,409
Don't you like, uh, Brad? He seems okay.

1008
00:56:37,411 --> 00:56:41,808
Yeah. Yeah. He's... he's just young.

1009
00:56:43,521 --> 00:56:45,941
We're always talking
about his hopes and dreams.

1010
00:56:45,943 --> 00:56:47,810
Oh, God...

1011
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,978
Yeah. It's depressing.

1012
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:54,686
Ahh, I just can't go
through all this again.

1013
00:56:55,346 --> 00:57:00,602
I mean, he thinks that he loves
me. But we would never last.

1014
00:57:01,882 --> 00:57:05,954
Even if I allowed myself to fall
in love with him... which I could...

1015
00:57:06,304 --> 00:57:12,978
Eventually he'd leave me
for someone young. Younger.

1016
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:15,912
Like Chris did.

1017
00:57:16,042 --> 00:57:21,388
He's crazy. He was so
stupid to cheat on you.

1018
00:57:24,408 --> 00:57:26,680
You smell amazing.

1019
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:32,146
Thank you. It's Jo Malone 154.

1020
00:57:32,656 --> 00:57:35,950
Lisa owns every perfume but that.

1021
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:39,186
Why don't you buy it for her?

1022
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:49,269
There's something about a person who gets
themselves everything that they want...

1023
00:57:49,759 --> 00:57:54,792
It makes you not want to get them stuff.

1024
00:57:57,012 --> 00:57:59,655
That sounds bad, doesn't
it? I sound like a jerk.

1025
00:57:59,657 --> 00:58:00,874
No, no.

1026
00:58:00,876 --> 00:58:02,227
Yeah.

1027
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:04,439
No. But maybe you need to
talk to someone about it.

1028
00:58:04,441 --> 00:58:08,459
What do you mean, a
therapist? I can't afford that.

1029
00:58:08,461 --> 00:58:10,107
Ga, Josh.

1030
00:58:10,109 --> 00:58:14,625
You have a $2.5-million-dollar
house, what're you talking about?

1031
00:58:14,627 --> 00:58:18,366
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm
talking about... I can't afford that.

1032
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:26,510
Time's up!!

1033
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:32,625
Where's Ginger?

1034
00:58:32,627 --> 00:58:34,458
She went to the bathroom.

1035
00:58:49,335 --> 00:58:52,175
Michelle.

1036
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:00,300
I'm so glad I got you.

1037
00:59:00,302 --> 00:59:01,516
Really?

1038
00:59:01,518 --> 00:59:02,817
Yeah.

1039
00:59:03,527 --> 00:59:05,517
Um, I need to ask you something.

1040
00:59:05,727 --> 00:59:07,646
Yeah, we can do more than just kiss.

1041
00:59:07,648 --> 00:59:12,250
No, no, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry. No, it's about Ginger.

1042
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,876
O-kay.

1043
00:59:15,766 --> 00:59:18,869
Do you think she would reconcile?

1044
00:59:19,629 --> 00:59:21,577
You wanna get back together?

1045
00:59:21,579 --> 00:59:24,067
Yeah. I have to get her back.

1046
00:59:25,347 --> 00:59:27,051
I don't know...

1047
00:59:27,071 --> 00:59:28,619
You must have some idea.

1048
00:59:28,621 --> 00:59:30,518
No, really, I don't.

1049
00:59:31,258 --> 00:59:33,655
I don't know if she'd go back.

1050
00:59:34,555 --> 00:59:36,494
You know, when she turns a corner...

1051
00:59:36,504 --> 00:59:39,028
I know. I know.

1052
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:44,894
In college, she used to cry over a guy
for a week and then he was dead to her.

1053
00:59:44,924 --> 00:59:47,530
When she's done, she's done, you know?

1054
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:48,565
Yeah.

1055
00:59:48,567 --> 00:59:50,613
If this is about her looking good, Chris...

1056
00:59:50,615 --> 00:59:53,340
Oh, please, I'm shallow,
I'm not ridiculous.

1057
00:59:53,342 --> 00:59:56,478
That's why I came here tonight, to see
if she would get back together with me

1058
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,006
And then she shows up with this boy toy.

1059
00:59:59,008 --> 01:00:01,814
You got a hotel room with
a 23-year-old actress!

1060
01:00:01,816 --> 01:00:03,471
She was twenty-eight.

1061
01:00:03,931 --> 01:00:06,190
Okay, well on IMDB it's says that she's...

1062
01:00:06,192 --> 01:00:09,896
She's an actress. She lies about her age.

1063
01:00:11,866 --> 01:00:13,642
So, you regret it?

1064
01:00:13,644 --> 01:00:17,347
Oh my god, yes, I regret it.

1065
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:19,584
If I could take it back, I would.

1066
01:00:21,964 --> 01:00:24,639
But at some point, it was exciting, right?

1067
01:00:25,279 --> 01:00:27,186
For about two minutes.

1068
01:00:27,188 --> 01:00:31,344
But it was, like, great, right?
Like, did you, like, feel alive?

1069
01:00:31,346 --> 01:00:36,068
Are you thinking about cheating on Dave? Is
that what this is about, our playing this game?

1070
01:00:36,358 --> 01:00:37,797
No, I just...

1071
01:00:38,657 --> 01:00:43,176
I'm so sick of Dave. You know?

1072
01:00:43,916 --> 01:00:48,286
Yeah, I know. And then you get tired
of the person you're cheating with.

1073
01:00:48,288 --> 01:00:53,840
And then, I don't know, it just seems like bad
form to cheat on the person you're cheating with.

1074
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,860
Yeah.

1075
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:01,588
And let me tell you something.
It's not real great out there.

1076
01:01:01,718 --> 01:01:04,832
What's it like? Dating again?

1077
01:01:04,834 --> 01:01:07,208
It sucks.

1078
01:01:07,822 --> 01:01:13,900
Because all these people have baggage. And
you're not exactly eager to find out what it is.

1079
01:01:13,902 --> 01:01:20,123
And I don't know. I don't feel like meeting
strangers in restaurants and, you know,

1080
01:01:20,125 --> 01:01:25,198
immediately finding out they're
nowhere near as good as Ginger.

1081
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:32,241
Did I tell you I went
to the Oscars this year?

1082
01:01:32,243 --> 01:01:34,693
A friend of mine had an
extra ticket so I got to go.

1083
01:01:34,695 --> 01:01:35,876
How was it?

1084
01:01:35,878 --> 01:01:39,648
Within five minutes of being there,
you're walking down the red carpet...

1085
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:43,170
and everybody's ignoring you
because you're not a star...

1086
01:01:43,172 --> 01:01:49,295
...and then you realize, you don't even want to
be there if you don't have a movie in the running.

1087
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:54,964
And at this point in my life,
I want to make something great.

1088
01:01:54,966 --> 01:01:59,755
You know? Something that moves
people, that makes them feel something.

1089
01:01:59,757 --> 01:02:04,004
And this is going to sound weird,
but I can't do it without Ginger.

1090
01:02:05,274 --> 01:02:08,539
I need her. I need her in my corner.

1091
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:11,660
Time's up!!

1092
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,702
Are you bummed we didn't do anything?

1093
01:02:13,704 --> 01:02:15,375
No, no, it's fine.

1094
01:02:17,015 --> 01:02:19,903
I hope Ginger takes you back.

1095
01:02:19,905 --> 01:02:22,774
Thanks. You're awesome.

1096
01:02:26,954 --> 01:02:31,394
Full sex, right? I'm prepared for anything.

1097
01:02:38,824 --> 01:02:41,906
I'm... I'm sorry. Can
I talk to you for a sec?

1098
01:02:41,908 --> 01:02:44,596
Yeah. Yeah.

1099
01:02:57,854 --> 01:02:59,232
How was it?

1100
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:00,464
What?

1101
01:03:03,214 --> 01:03:05,010
Making out with Josh.

1102
01:03:05,012 --> 01:03:09,632
We didn't make out. We
just, we kissed a little.

1103
01:03:09,634 --> 01:03:10,743
Was it good?

1104
01:03:11,603 --> 01:03:15,127
Brad. We just talked. I was upset.

1105
01:03:15,129 --> 01:03:17,286
Why? Why were you upset?

1106
01:03:18,106 --> 01:03:20,431
He cheated on you and he left you.

1107
01:03:20,433 --> 01:03:22,311
I know.

1108
01:03:23,061 --> 01:03:25,581
What do you see in him?

1109
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:28,863
Okay, yeah, maybe he was
good-looking when he was young, but...

1110
01:03:28,865 --> 01:03:30,877
Brad, he and I are the same age.

1111
01:03:30,879 --> 01:03:38,231
Yeah, but you're beautiful and interesting
and smart, and he's this Hollywood producer.

1112
01:03:38,233 --> 01:03:42,005
And you took vows. And he
slept with someone else.

1113
01:03:42,007 --> 01:03:43,691
Doesn't that bother you?

1114
01:03:43,693 --> 01:03:47,341
Of course. It all bothers me!

1115
01:03:47,343 --> 01:03:51,521
The fact that he cheated, the fact
that we're getting a divorce...

1116
01:03:51,523 --> 01:03:56,896
The fact that Oliver's going to have to deal with
the effects of this divorce for the rest of his life.

1117
01:03:56,898 --> 01:04:00,211
Stepmothers, and stepfathers, flying
back and forth across the country...

1118
01:04:00,213 --> 01:04:04,089
To see one parent while he's
missing the one he's not with.

1119
01:04:10,439 --> 01:04:12,255
Brad, what are we doing?

1120
01:04:12,575 --> 01:04:13,833
What do you mean?

1121
01:04:14,133 --> 01:04:16,565
You want me to fall in love with you?

1122
01:04:16,655 --> 01:04:20,017
Yes! Please! That's what I want!

1123
01:04:20,019 --> 01:04:21,682
Okay, then what?

1124
01:04:21,684 --> 01:04:28,947
We... we enjoy life. And...
and we have fun together.

1125
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:30,752
And we have amazing sex.

1126
01:04:30,754 --> 01:04:33,008
How long would that last?

1127
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:35,059
Ah...

1128
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:39,751
Even if we lasted a couple of years...
if we even made it to spring...

1129
01:04:39,753 --> 01:04:41,528
Of course we'd make it to spring.

1130
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:46,902
Okay, then what? We get married,
and you become Oliver's stepfather?

1131
01:04:46,904 --> 01:04:53,460
You're gonna wanna be with someone young.
Someone who's in the same life phase as you.

1132
01:04:53,462 --> 01:04:54,824
Life phase?

1133
01:04:54,826 --> 01:05:01,034
Yeah, life phase. Mine involves
my eyesight suddenly going to shit.

1134
01:05:01,036 --> 01:05:05,194
And buying reading glasses at
the drugstore, like old people.

1135
01:05:05,196 --> 01:05:09,404
Worrying about how the teen years are
going to be. Getting root canals, and...

1136
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:12,585
It's not all serious. You can have fun.

1137
01:05:12,835 --> 01:05:14,828
Yeah, but...

1138
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:22,045
I guess at the end of the day, I want to be with
someone who is in the same place in life as me.

1139
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:32,675
I'm ready.

1140
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:36,932
Lisa.

1141
01:05:45,689 --> 01:05:47,006
Mm!

1142
01:06:25,671 --> 01:06:27,470
Time's up!!

1143
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:31,076
Time's up!

1144
01:06:33,446 --> 01:06:34,712
Oh, boy.

1145
01:06:34,882 --> 01:06:36,467
Are you kidding me?!

1146
01:06:36,469 --> 01:06:38,246
Hey, thanks for dinner.

1147
01:06:38,846 --> 01:06:40,321
Is he leaving?

1148
01:06:40,323 --> 01:06:41,726
What the hell did you do?!

1149
01:06:41,728 --> 01:06:42,862
Nothing.

1150
01:06:42,864 --> 01:06:44,252
Right.

1151
01:06:45,462 --> 01:06:48,400
We said we were gonna honor the contract!

1152
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,533
You okay?

1153
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:26,836
Ginger...

1154
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:31,492
I wanna get back together.

1155
01:07:34,172 --> 01:07:35,719
Are you kidding?

1156
01:07:36,909 --> 01:07:38,364
No.

1157
01:07:40,324 --> 01:07:42,928
I'm sorry, you know, about arguing earlier.

1158
01:07:43,238 --> 01:07:45,552
Yeah, me, too.

1159
01:07:45,772 --> 01:07:47,736
I'm developing a new theory.

1160
01:07:47,926 --> 01:07:49,671
What's your theory?

1161
01:07:51,171 --> 01:07:55,542
The fact that everything is based on
these little white lies is a good thing.

1162
01:07:55,544 --> 01:08:01,585
You know? It's people being compassionate toward
one another. Protecting each other's feelings.

1163
01:08:01,587 --> 01:08:04,021
Okay. I wanna go with this. Go ahead.

1164
01:08:04,251 --> 01:08:08,088
Like, it's hard enough for me to
accept Lisa has nice breasts...

1165
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:09,310
No, she doesn't...

1166
01:08:09,312 --> 01:08:12,169
But I don't want to hear
you say it aloud. You know?

1167
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:15,655
Better for me to just hope you don't
spend too much time thinking about them.

1168
01:08:15,657 --> 01:08:17,434
I don't.

1169
01:08:17,794 --> 01:08:19,105
Right.

1170
01:08:20,145 --> 01:08:27,236
These little white lies, they are the glue that hold
relationships together. They hold society together.

1171
01:08:30,756 --> 01:08:34,355
So, uh, what'd you
think of my new material?

1172
01:08:34,357 --> 01:08:35,755
I think it's great.

1173
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:37,379
But what?

1174
01:08:37,381 --> 01:08:39,812
Nothing. I think it's great.

1175
01:08:40,932 --> 01:08:43,444
What specifically did
you have a problem with?

1176
01:08:43,764 --> 01:08:48,123
I didn't have a problem with
any of it. It's all good.

1177
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:50,488
But not as good as my best stuff.

1178
01:08:51,488 --> 01:08:52,842
It will be.

1179
01:08:53,302 --> 01:08:55,859
You're going to do your tweaking. You know?

1180
01:08:55,861 --> 01:09:00,340
You're gonna rewrite it, and rewrite it, and it's
gonna be on the same level as your other stuff.

1181
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:04,748
Sounds like I got a lot
of rewriting to do, huh?

1182
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:09,119
I feel like we have not
fought this much in a year.

1183
01:09:09,121 --> 01:09:11,807
It's these people. They're a bad influence.

1184
01:09:12,807 --> 01:09:14,951
So, is this because I've lost weight?

1185
01:09:14,953 --> 01:09:16,984
No. Gain it all back, I don't care.

1186
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:22,048
Oh, you do care! Okay? Men
are visually stimulated.

1187
01:09:24,698 --> 01:09:30,298
See, I miss this. I miss our
conversations. I miss good conversation.

1188
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:37,121
I went to every screening of every movie
and defended each as if it were my own child.

1189
01:09:37,911 --> 01:09:40,360
The Hallmark movie, Chris?

1190
01:09:40,362 --> 01:09:42,583
You're an angel.

1191
01:09:46,843 --> 01:09:51,240
I used to love to cook for you. I
don't know if I could do that now.

1192
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:53,896
Don't say that!

1193
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:58,644
Do you know how many tears
Oliver and I have cried over you?

1194
01:09:58,646 --> 01:10:00,504
I'm sorry...

1195
01:10:00,506 --> 01:10:07,077
Being cheated on and being walked
out on... It's very shaming!

1196
01:10:07,817 --> 01:10:11,674
Everyone's going to look at me and
wonder how I could take you back.

1197
01:10:12,224 --> 01:10:17,489
I will spend the rest of my
life making this up to you, Gin.

1198
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:23,311
So, we're gonna go the whole rest of our
marriage without you telling me what you did?

1199
01:10:23,313 --> 01:10:26,732
The 'whole rest of our marriage' makes it
sound like we're gonna last a long time.

1200
01:10:26,734 --> 01:10:28,189
You don't think we will?

1201
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:29,432
I don't know.

1202
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:32,502
Well, that doesn't sound good.

1203
01:10:34,172 --> 01:10:37,775
Is this about that kid? What, are you,
like, in love with him or something?

1204
01:10:38,545 --> 01:10:39,416
No.

1205
01:10:40,036 --> 01:10:41,758
I can't believe this.

1206
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,222
That punk. I served him Opus One.

1207
01:10:44,224 --> 01:10:47,128
And he did God knows what with my wife.

1208
01:10:47,130 --> 01:10:49,521
Josh, I didn't say I wanna break up.

1209
01:10:49,523 --> 01:10:52,549
It wouldn't be a break-up,
it would be a divorce.

1210
01:10:53,469 --> 01:10:57,120
Well, I'm not thinking about divorce.

1211
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,931
I was earlier tonight.

1212
01:10:59,261 --> 01:11:00,474
What?!

1213
01:11:01,514 --> 01:11:04,828
It's just that the girls think
that you don't respect me.

1214
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:10,234
The way that you're always making sarcastic
remarks and trying to take me down a notch.

1215
01:11:10,236 --> 01:11:11,542
I respect you.

1216
01:11:13,272 --> 01:11:15,656
I don't know if you do.

1217
01:11:17,186 --> 01:11:22,404
Wha... what does that word mean
anyway...'respect'? Respect.

1218
01:11:27,324 --> 01:11:32,954
Obviously, I respect you. If I didn't, why
would I want to go to that kid's next showcase

1219
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:37,128
and beat the shit out of him in front
of his agents and managers and everybody?

1220
01:11:38,228 --> 01:11:42,029
Not much of a guest room. What
is this, the servants' quarters?

1221
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:44,340
Stop complaining.

1222
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:48,543
So. What'd you and Chris do?

1223
01:11:48,733 --> 01:11:50,278
Nothing.

1224
01:11:50,578 --> 01:11:52,723
Michelle.

1225
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:57,353
I'm serious. We didn't do anything. We just
talked. He wants to get back together with Ginger.

1226
01:11:57,355 --> 01:12:00,523
He does? Is she gonna take him back?

1227
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:02,864
I don't know.

1228
01:12:03,714 --> 01:12:05,438
What did you and Lisa do?

1229
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:07,345
Wait, I wanna talk about Ginger and Chris.

1230
01:12:07,347 --> 01:12:10,002
No, let's talk about you and Lisa.

1231
01:12:10,642 --> 01:12:13,569
I'm not trying to grill
you, I'm just curious.

1232
01:12:14,499 --> 01:12:17,024
I'm glad it was her.
I'm not jealous of her.

1233
01:12:17,026 --> 01:12:18,644
You're not?

1234
01:12:20,304 --> 01:12:22,437
Do you think I should be?

1235
01:12:23,617 --> 01:12:25,409
You have a thing for Lisa now!

1236
01:12:25,629 --> 01:12:27,243
No, I don't.

1237
01:12:27,245 --> 01:12:32,424
Dave. Her boobs are so
big. They're too big.

1238
01:12:32,724 --> 01:12:38,057
Just because I don't think she's a threat doesn't mean
she's not a threat. You could be totally attracted to her.

1239
01:12:42,182 --> 01:12:44,209
You think she's hot!

1240
01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:46,964
You loved making out with
her. Did you do more than kiss?

1241
01:12:46,966 --> 01:12:48,341
No.

1242
01:12:48,343 --> 01:12:50,444
Did you wish you did more than kiss?

1243
01:12:51,144 --> 01:12:53,852
Wha... it's... why is that even...

1244
01:12:53,854 --> 01:12:55,814
Oh my god!

1245
01:12:55,974 --> 01:12:58,125
I'm so jealous, I could scream.

1246
01:12:58,127 --> 01:13:00,833
I could totally freak out right now.

1247
01:13:01,453 --> 01:13:02,817
Oh my god.

1248
01:13:02,819 --> 01:13:05,705
She has a great body, doesn't she?

1249
01:13:06,245 --> 01:13:08,866
Are you... you really
want me to answer that?

1250
01:13:08,868 --> 01:13:11,985
YES. Do you think she has a good body?

1251
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:13,431
Unh...

1252
01:13:14,781 --> 01:13:17,113
Maybe? I don't... this is stupid...

1253
01:13:17,115 --> 01:13:19,401
How can you say that to me?!

1254
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,788
All I said was 'maybe'!

1255
01:13:21,958 --> 01:13:23,814
Oh my god!

1256
01:13:23,994 --> 01:13:27,840
She has a good figure and
I'm a short-waisted freak!

1257
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:32,086
You are not a short-waisted freak.

1258
01:13:35,614 --> 01:13:39,001
If you were innocent, you
would just tell me what you did.

1259
01:13:39,003 --> 01:13:42,740
The fact that you won't tell me what
you did means you're guilty of something!

1260
01:13:42,742 --> 01:13:44,920
We signed a contract
for exactly this reason.

1261
01:13:44,922 --> 01:13:47,306
You know what's weird?

1262
01:13:47,308 --> 01:13:51,587
You haven't asked what Ginger and I did.
Because it hasn't even occurred to you...

1263
01:13:51,589 --> 01:13:54,588
because you're so consumed
by thoughts of Brad!

1264
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:57,092
What did you do? Tell me what you did!

1265
01:14:03,992 --> 01:14:09,119
So, what, I'm just... I'm just supposed to go around
wondering what you did for the rest of my life?

1266
01:14:09,121 --> 01:14:13,574
Yeah. Just like I'll always wonder what
you did with that girl, Jennifer, from work.

1267
01:14:13,576 --> 01:14:18,202
Oh, I knew you were going to play that
card. That happened eight years ago.

1268
01:14:20,442 --> 01:14:23,402
It feels like yesterday.

1269
01:14:24,784 --> 01:14:27,905
You can't. Try all you want,
but you're not going to.

1270
01:14:27,907 --> 01:14:29,941
Let me love you. Let me love you!

1271
01:14:29,943 --> 01:14:31,316
No!

1272
01:14:31,546 --> 01:14:32,715
Stop. You're too...

1273
01:14:32,717 --> 01:14:33,703
Okay, just give up.

1274
01:14:33,705 --> 01:14:34,434
No!

1275
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:35,206
Just give up!

1276
01:14:35,208 --> 01:14:36,390
No!

1277
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:45,932
I wanna read that script he sold.

1278
01:14:47,632 --> 01:14:52,070
It's weird. There's so
many people out there.

1279
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:56,248
But there's no one like you.

1280
01:15:01,028 --> 01:15:03,777
Please give me another chance.

1281
01:15:05,157 --> 01:15:07,941
I don't know if I can get over it.

1282
01:15:07,943 --> 01:15:12,092
Tell me what to do to make
this right. I'll do anything.

1283
01:15:15,472 --> 01:15:20,757
You know, the obvious thing
is that you get a free pass.

1284
01:15:22,292 --> 01:15:25,497
You get to cheat on me.
Once. Whenever you want.

1285
01:15:27,387 --> 01:15:30,707
I would argue that that kid,
Brad, counts for something.

1286
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:33,789
Because I know you had better sex
with him than I did with the actress.

1287
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:38,765
Well, I'm sorry that you didn't fully
enjoy yourself when you were cheating on me.

1288
01:15:59,165 --> 01:16:00,408
Tense up.

1289
01:16:00,808 --> 01:16:01,568
What?

1290
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:02,827
Just tense your stomach muscles up.

1291
01:16:02,829 --> 01:16:03,401
I don't...

1292
01:16:03,403 --> 01:16:04,381
Go ahead, do it.

1293
01:16:04,383 --> 01:16:06,246
I don't understand... oh!

1294
01:16:06,248 --> 01:16:07,261
Ow!

1295
01:16:27,946 --> 01:16:33,031
From this point forward, I won't bring
up Brad and you won't bring up Jennifer.

1296
01:16:34,271 --> 01:16:36,461
Okay.

1297
01:16:40,651 --> 01:16:42,838
Something's changed.

1298
01:16:43,108 --> 01:16:44,479
What do you mean?

1299
01:16:44,481 --> 01:16:47,557
I don't know. It's like
you're not as invested.

1300
01:16:49,227 --> 01:16:51,939
I'm invested.

1301
01:16:54,989 --> 01:16:57,939
What are you doing? You
always stay up and work.

1302
01:16:57,941 --> 01:17:00,628
Not tonight. We gotta have sex.

1303
01:17:01,758 --> 01:17:04,926
I gotta try to make you
forget about that kid.

1304
01:17:06,116 --> 01:17:07,974
Who shall remain nameless.

1305
01:17:08,794 --> 01:17:11,312
I didn't get to do anything.

1306
01:17:11,314 --> 01:17:15,364
Everybody got to do
something except for me.

1307
01:18:50,661 --> 01:18:52,552
Prescriptions? For what?

1308
01:18:52,554 --> 01:18:57,766
You name it. High blood pressure, reflux,
hair loss, anxiety... the guy is falling apart.

1309
01:18:57,768 --> 01:19:01,397
The price of success. You know,
he's under a lot of pressure.

1310
01:19:01,399 --> 01:19:04,754
Yeah, maybe that's what we're in for
when we get to where we wanna be, huh?

1311
01:19:04,756 --> 01:19:07,407
No, no, we'll be different.
We'll handle it better.

1312
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:08,393
Ah, right.

1313
01:19:08,395 --> 01:19:10,676
Stay grounded, keep our
priorities straight...

1314
01:19:10,678 --> 01:19:13,814
Right. Maybe the guy's just
not good at handling stress.

1315
01:19:13,816 --> 01:19:17,286
Yeah. We'll handle it better.

1316
01:19:17,288 --> 01:19:18,587
I feel for him.

1317
01:19:18,589 --> 01:19:19,926
Yeah?

1318
01:19:19,928 --> 01:19:21,780
Mm-hm.

1319
01:19:27,946 --> 01:19:29,619
Bye.

1320
01:19:48,289 --> 01:19:51,898
Okay. Alright. I'll call you
when I get there. Thanks. Bye.

1321
01:19:53,158 --> 01:19:55,560
Ginger told me to tell you thanks.

1322
01:19:55,562 --> 01:19:56,781
For what?

1323
01:19:56,783 --> 01:20:00,221
She said you were kind to her last night.

1324
01:20:05,828 --> 01:20:07,891
Let's call Oliver.

1325
01:20:10,721 --> 01:20:13,003
We can't screw up again.

1326
01:20:14,023 --> 01:20:15,411
YOU can't.

1327
01:20:15,413 --> 01:20:18,013
I won't. I'm not going to.

1328
01:20:18,015 --> 01:20:22,151
We can't put him through that again.

1329
01:20:22,741 --> 01:20:24,780
We won't.

1330
01:20:31,390 --> 01:20:33,797
The girls all think
you're really attractive.

1331
01:20:33,799 --> 01:20:35,494
They do?

1332
01:20:36,764 --> 01:20:39,309
Well, what'd they say, exactly?

1333
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:41,856
That you have sex appeal.

1334
01:20:42,476 --> 01:20:45,643
They think you're great. They love you.

1335
01:20:48,553 --> 01:20:51,042
What's the matter? What's wrong?

1336
01:20:54,302 --> 01:20:55,407
I'm sorry...

1337
01:20:55,957 --> 01:20:57,232
For what?

1338
01:20:57,462 --> 01:21:01,631
It's, just, I know I can
be short-tempered and...

1339
01:21:02,495 --> 01:21:04,023
Well, you get no sleep.

1340
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:07,045
You're walking around
totally sleep-deprived.

1341
01:21:07,047 --> 01:21:09,567
And here you're trying to write,
and mastermind everything...

1342
01:21:09,569 --> 01:21:11,221
where the kids are going to go to school,

1343
01:21:11,223 --> 01:21:13,917
and what's the best
pediatrician for them to go to,

1344
01:21:13,919 --> 01:21:16,413
and whether or not they're
going to get flu shots...

1345
01:21:16,415 --> 01:21:22,752
You're an amazing mom. And I'm no help. I mean,
I'm lame. I don't do anything compared to you.

1346
01:21:24,602 --> 01:21:26,761
Thank you.

1347
01:21:27,641 --> 01:21:32,170
That's all I wanted to hear...
just the acknowledgement, you know?

1348
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,933
We should go out. Once a week.

1349
01:21:38,653 --> 01:21:42,414
Just the two of us. I don't care
what it costs, we have to do it.

1350
01:21:42,416 --> 01:21:44,509
Okay.

1351
01:21:46,809 --> 01:21:49,863
Do you remember what Antonio Banderas said?

1352
01:21:50,283 --> 01:21:53,277
"A relationship is like a fire."

1353
01:21:55,237 --> 01:21:59,613
"You have to throw wood
on it to keep it going."

1354
01:22:00,253 --> 01:22:01,927
Si.

1355
01:22:07,604 --> 01:22:08,862
I've been thinking about New York.

1356
01:22:08,864 --> 01:22:10,267
Really?

1357
01:22:10,269 --> 01:22:14,069
Yeah. For a writer, it's
the best place to live.

1358
01:22:14,071 --> 01:22:19,665
You know, you overhear the most interesting
conversations that you would never hear in L.A.

1359
01:22:21,325 --> 01:22:25,788
I don't know. I know that
Manhattan is crazy expensive...

1360
01:22:25,908 --> 01:22:28,397
The air quality is terrible...

1361
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:32,254
Right. But what if, deep down inside, you
believe that it's the only place to live?

1362
01:22:33,154 --> 01:22:35,678
Is that what you think?

1363
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:38,205
Maybe.

1364
01:22:39,465 --> 01:22:41,380
Me, too.

1365
01:22:41,382 --> 01:22:47,407
Let's go. I mean, I could easily
leave, you know? I'm serious.

1366
01:22:47,409 --> 01:22:52,965
I mean, I love our friends,
but... I could walk away.

1367
01:22:55,615 --> 01:22:57,190
We can't move.

1368
01:22:57,192 --> 01:23:00,250
Yeah. Not yet.

1369
01:23:00,252 --> 01:23:03,481
I gotta be out here for meetings and stuff.

1370
01:23:06,031 --> 01:23:09,330
Dave and Michelle are
hosting the next dinner.

1371
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,821
Should be fun.

1372
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:14,932
Yeah. Should be.

1373
01:23:17,635 --> 01:23:22,635
