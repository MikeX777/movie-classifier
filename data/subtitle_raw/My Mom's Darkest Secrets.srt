00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:46,335
Uh...

862
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:56,579
<i>I understand,</i>
<i>but we can only do that</i>

863
00:46:56,681 --> 00:47:00,416
if you maintain a balance in your
money-market account. Thank you.

864
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,086
Once the transfer's gone
through, it shouldn't be

865
00:47:04,189 --> 00:47:06,689
a problem. Of course.

866
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:09,058
You're welcome.

867
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:14,163
(unsettling music)

868
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:30,613
Oh, my God!

869
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:38,988
Thank you so much for coming.
Of course.

870
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,924
What's going on?
I don't know exactly.

871
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,327
But I overheard and...

872
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:46,429
I think they found a knife
with dried blood on it.

873
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:49,265
Wait, in the house? How come
they didn't find that before?

874
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,500
Apparently, it was in
a hidden cupboard or something.

875
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:54,537
Wherever it was, they must not have
searched there the first time.

876
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:57,506
What set all this off:

877
00:47:57,609 --> 00:48:00,243
The search warrant
or Sara's arrest yesterday?

878
00:48:00,345 --> 00:48:03,312
I didn't catch all of it,
but it sounded

879
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:06,182
like they got an anonymous tip
from someone that Sara threw out

880
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:08,885
a bloody nightgown in the trash
in the middle of the night.

881
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:11,153
Babe, I hate to say this,

882
00:48:11,256 --> 00:48:13,522
but it's really starting
to sound like she's guilty.

883
00:48:17,595 --> 00:48:20,563
You hired a private investigator
to run a background check on Sara?

884
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:22,531
She did it
right after you found her.

885
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:26,669
I just wanted to make sure there is nothing
about her you needed protection from.

886
00:48:28,806 --> 00:48:31,040
There's quite a bit in there:

887
00:48:31,142 --> 00:48:34,043
Previous addresses, employment
history, vital records.

888
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:37,413
There's a lot
you don't know about her.

889
00:48:46,224 --> 00:48:47,690
I know.

890
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:49,859
I lied about a lot of things.
You lied

891
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:51,627
about almost everything.

892
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:54,830
And what you didn't lie about,
you completely made up.

893
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,401
Yeah, I know.

894
00:48:58,503 --> 00:49:01,470
Why? Why would you
do that to me?

895
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:03,439
I came to you wanting
to know who you were,

896
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:05,574
what your life was like...

897
00:49:05,677 --> 00:49:07,476
why you gave me up.

898
00:49:07,578 --> 00:49:10,146
I couldn't tell you the truth:

899
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:13,316
That when I got pregnant
with you, I was an escort,

900
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:17,420
that I don't know
who your real dad is...

901
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,023
that I'd been arrested six times

902
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,225
and I was a drug addict.

903
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:27,697
I was so happy when you found me

904
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:29,665
and I just figured...

905
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:31,400
I figured if you knew
any of that,

906
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:33,369
you would have walked away
and never contacted me again.

907
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:36,439
So you basically made up
a person that didn't exist.

908
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:40,676
No. I let you into my life
the way it is now.

909
00:49:40,745 --> 00:49:42,812
I went to rehab
and I met a guy there,

910
00:49:42,914 --> 00:49:44,847
and he helped me
turn my life around.

911
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:47,650
And a year later, I met Trevor.

912
00:49:47,752 --> 00:49:51,020
- That is such a load of crap!
- Hey, you know what?

913
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:52,822
(menacing music)

914
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,394
You wanna know
the truth about me?

915
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,930
I'll tell you the truth.

916
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:03,699
I was not a good person, Ashley.

917
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:05,534
I used people.

918
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:07,737
I wasted every opportunity
that was given to me.

919
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,705
I drank a lot and I did

920
00:50:09,807 --> 00:50:12,041
a lot of drugs.

921
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:14,643
But you know what?

922
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:16,379
I am not that person anymore.

923
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:20,883
I am a completely
different person.

924
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:26,022
OK.

925
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:29,558
I need you to be honest
with me, for once.

926
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,862
Did you kill Trevor?

927
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:35,731
No.

928
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:38,367
Then why would you throw away
a nightgown with blood on it?

929
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:40,603
I don't know! I didn't!

930
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:41,904
I didn't!

931
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:43,973
I don't even leave
the house at night!

932
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:47,910
Whoever called in that tip
must have put it there!

933
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,647
Somebody is trying to frame me!

934
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:56,385
Don't give up on me.

935
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:59,989
Please, I need you.

936
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:09,965
My lawyer doesn't think
I'm gonna make bail.

937
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:13,602
Why not?

938
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,638
Because a few years ago,
I skipped out

939
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,606
when I was arrested
for shoplifting.

940
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:20,409
(scoffing)

941
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:22,178
- Geez.
- My hearing is

942
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,313
the day after tomorrow at 2 p.m.

943
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:26,849
Will you be there?

944
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:32,421
I don't know.

945
00:51:34,492 --> 00:51:36,992
Can you...?

946
00:51:38,162 --> 00:51:41,997
♪♪♪

947
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,440
(sighing)

948
00:51:59,016 --> 00:52:01,317
(car door opening)

949
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,522
- Amy?
- You weren't answering

950
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:08,891
my texts. I got worried.
(Ashley sighing)

951
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:11,861
It's been a rough 48 hours.
Come on in.

952
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,098
I wanna believe she's innocent,

953
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,969
but, honestly,
I'm not so sure anymore.

954
00:52:20,071 --> 00:52:21,904
And just lied

955
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:24,673
about so many things.

956
00:52:24,775 --> 00:52:26,609
I know this is
gonna sound crazy,

957
00:52:26,711 --> 00:52:29,445
but I think Sara's right.

958
00:52:29,547 --> 00:52:32,181
Someone's trying to frame her.

959
00:52:32,283 --> 00:52:34,950
- Why would you say that?
- The knife they found,

960
00:52:35,052 --> 00:52:38,053
it was in a hidden cupboard.
OK...

961
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:40,623
I don't think that Sara even
knows that cupboard exists.

962
00:52:40,725 --> 00:52:42,591
But more importantly,

963
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:44,360
the knife was not there
two days ago.

964
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:47,163
And how do you know this?

965
00:52:47,265 --> 00:52:49,565
The night that we both ended
up there at the same time,

966
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,634
<i>I looked in the cupboard,</i>

967
00:52:51,736 --> 00:52:54,270
<i>and it wasn't there.</i>
<i>Nothing was.</i>

968
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:57,039
And then it magically appeared
the following day.

969
00:52:57,141 --> 00:52:59,808
Why were you looking in there?

970
00:52:59,911 --> 00:53:01,710
I was looking for something

971
00:53:01,812 --> 00:53:03,812
that my dad would have wanted
to keep hidden from Sara:

972
00:53:03,915 --> 00:53:06,448
Threatening letters,
legal papers,

973
00:53:06,551 --> 00:53:08,617
I don't know.

974
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:10,686
My dad used to hide gifts
for my mom there

975
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:12,488
when she was still alive.

976
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,857
I didn't really expect
to find anything but I...

977
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:16,692
I figured it was worth a shot.

978
00:53:16,794 --> 00:53:19,828
- And is there anyone else who knows about it?
- Not sure,

979
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:22,865
but the killer obviously knew
the layout of the house.

980
00:53:22,967 --> 00:53:24,934
Amy, you have to go
to the police with this.

981
00:53:25,036 --> 00:53:26,435
I don't know
how receptive they'll be.

982
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:28,537
They think they have
their person.

983
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:33,275
We need something concrete.
OK. Let's start by making

984
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:35,544
a list of everyone that went
in and out of the house.

985
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:40,416
The housekeeper, she wouldn't
have anything to do with this.

986
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:42,685
The police,
although I don't know

987
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:44,787
why they would want
to frame your mother.

988
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:45,754
Michael?

989
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:48,023
Possibly.

990
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:50,993
He did use to house sit for them
from time to time.

991
00:53:51,095 --> 00:53:52,962
You...

992
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:55,764
You think I could have
killed my father?!

993
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:58,934
- No. I'm just saying you had access.
- I loved my father!

994
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:00,869
He wasn't always a good person,

995
00:54:00,972 --> 00:54:03,305
but he was always good to me
and he did not deserve

996
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,908
what happened to him! Look,

997
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:08,644
I know it's no secret
that I don't like Sara,

998
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,946
but I do not wanna see

999
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:12,848
an innocent person go to prison

1000
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:15,851
while the person who murdered
my father is still out there!

1001
00:54:17,888 --> 00:54:20,389
Whoever did this needs to pay.

1002
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:24,093
I'm sorry. I-I believe you. I...

1003
00:54:24,195 --> 00:54:26,395
I want the exact same thing
that you do.

1004
00:54:26,497 --> 00:54:28,831
(sighing)

1005
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:30,699
There is another possibility.

1006
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:32,201
Who?

1007
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:34,770
I'm pretty sure my father
was having an affair.

1008
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:37,439
I don't know who it was with,

1009
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:39,742
but one day we were
at a restaurant,

1010
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:42,244
and he got a text from her
while he was in the restroom.

1011
00:54:42,346 --> 00:54:45,547
I saw it come up on his phone.

1012
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,950
So maybe her husband found out

1013
00:54:48,052 --> 00:54:51,553
or Trevor broke it off with her
and she got jealous?

1014
00:54:51,656 --> 00:54:53,922
It's worth looking into.

1015
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,493
How do we start?

1016
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,463
So, basically, we're looking

1017
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:03,232
for any hotel receipts

1018
00:55:03,334 --> 00:55:06,001
or any restaurant receipts
where two people ate.

1019
00:55:06,103 --> 00:55:08,837
There's probably
a million of them, but yes.

1020
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:11,874
(sighing) What about your uncle?

1021
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:13,809
It seemed like
they were pretty close.

1022
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:16,145
Given that Kelsie
was cheating on Michael,

1023
00:55:16,247 --> 00:55:18,347
I doubt my dad would have
been likely to tell Michael

1024
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:20,449
he was doing
the same thing to Sara.

1025
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:22,951
Yeah, you're probably right
on that.

1026
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:27,389
(suspenseful music)

1027
00:55:29,627 --> 00:55:32,361
(sinister music)

1028
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:46,642
(doorbell ringing)

1029
00:55:49,647 --> 00:55:51,647
(tablet bleeping)
- Michael,

1030
00:55:51,749 --> 00:55:55,050
what are you doing here?
[I need to see you.]

1031
00:55:55,152 --> 00:55:58,687
- No, you don't. Go home.
- I just lost my brother.

1032
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:00,589
For Christ's sake,
have some compassion.

1033
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:04,159
I am sorry about Trevor,

to make sure

Whatever, man.
It's not important.

1208

The point is they were there,
both of them together,

1209
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:12,974

questions about me.

No. But if Ashley thinks

they keep digging around...

1213

Kelsie told you that?

1237

That she thinks
Michael hired someone

1238
01:06:38,028 --> 01:06:41,596
and that she and Trevor
were sleeping together?

1239
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:43,465
I am so sorry

1240
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:45,533
that we didn't
believe you before,

1241

Look, Sara,

1243
01:06:50,307 --> 01:06:53,174
obviously Michael is
trying to frame you.

1244
01:06:53,276 --> 01:06:56,111
We think that if we can
go to the police

1245
01:06:56,213 --> 01:06:58,413
with proof of the affair,
then maybe they can

1246
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:01,116
convince Kelsie to talk.
Or at the very least,

1247
01:07:01,218 --> 01:07:03,218
just dig a little deeper
into his finances

1248
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,120
and see if he could have
hired someone.

1249
01:07:05,222 --> 01:07:07,722
I always wondered
if Trevor was being unfaithful.

1250
01:07:10,127 --> 01:07:12,027
I used to call his hotel room
late at night

1251
01:07:12,129 --> 01:07:14,129
and he wouldn't
pick up the phone.

1252
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:15,930
He always made it seem

1253
01:07:16,033 --> 01:07:18,199
like the pills
were making me paranoid.

1254
01:07:18,301 --> 01:07:21,302
Makes sense it was Kelsie.

1255
01:07:21,405 --> 01:07:24,506
Is there anything
you can think that could help us

1256
01:07:24,608 --> 01:07:26,474
prove to the cops that they were
sleeping together?

1257
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:29,177
No.

1258
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:31,146
I think he was quite successful

1259
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:33,615
at hiding his affair.
Maybe going

1260
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:37,519

could yield something:

1261

Listen to me.

No. Just send an ambulance!
Please hurry!
