1
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:16,607
<i>The legend of Orpheus</i>
<i>is well-known.</i>

2
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:23,013
<i>ln Greek mythology, Orpheus was</i>
<i>a troubadour from Thrace.</i>

3
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:26,526
<i>He charmed even the animals.</i>

4
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:31,557
<i>His songs diverted his attention</i>
<i>from his wife Eurydice.</i>

5
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:34,928
<i>Death took her away from him.</i>

6
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:37,401
<i>He descended</i>
<i>to the netherworld,</i>

7
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:40,440
<i>and used his charm</i>
<i>to win permission</i>

8
00:02:40,507 --> 00:02:42,498
<i>to return with Eurydice</i>
<i>to the world of the living</i>

9
00:02:42,576 --> 00:02:45,943
<i>on the condition</i>
<i>that he never look at her.</i>

10
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:48,273
<i>But he looked at her</i>

11
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:52,412
<i>and was torn away from her</i>
<i>by the Bacchantes.</i>

12
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:55,754
<i>Where does our story</i>
<i>take place...</i>

13
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:58,488
<i>and when?</i>

14
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:03,226
<i>A legend is entitled to be</i>
<i>beyond time and place.</i>

15
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:05,992
<i>lnterpret it as you wish...</i>

16
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:54,612
Heurtebise, help Cegeste
across the square.

17
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:59,246
I'M not drunk!

18
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,184
Yes, you are.

19
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:32,081
Orpheus!

20
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:37,617
- Greetings!
- You're sMashed.

21
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:42,358
Sit down for a Minute.

22
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:46,828
- I've driven everyone away.
- You've entered the lion's den.

23
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,500
I wanted to fiind out--

24
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:53,594
- What will you have to drink?
- Nothing, thanks. I had a drink.

25
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:56,164
It was rather bitter.

26
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:58,870
You're brave to speak to Me.

27
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,210
I'M no longer in the battle.

28
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:06,050
I gave up writing at 20.
I had nothing new to say.

29
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,287
They respect My silence.

30
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:11,523
No doubt they think
I have nothing new to say,

31
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:14,992
and that a poet should not be
too faMous.

32
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:17,927
They're not very fond of you.

33
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:20,862
Actually, they hate Me.

34
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,351
Who's the not very aMiable
young drunkard

35
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:45,823
who doesn't seeM to be
averse to luxury?

36
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:49,259
That is Jacques Cegeste.
A poet.

37
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:52,258
He's 18 years old
and adored by all.

38
00:05:52,932 --> 00:05:54,957
His coMpanion, the princess,
fiinances the review

39
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:57,526
that published his fiirst poeMs.

40
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:00,931
The princess is very beautiful
and very elegant.

41
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:04,166
She's not froM here,
but she needs to be aMong us.

42
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:06,375
Here is her review.

43
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:10,577
Every page is blank!

44
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,278
It's called ''NudisM.''

45
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:15,921
It's absurd.

46
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:19,685
Less absurd than if it were
full of absurd writing.

47
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:22,350
No excess is absurd.

48
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:26,325
Orpheus, your gravest fault

49
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,835
is knowing how to get away
with going too far.

50
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:32,100
The public loves Me.

51
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:35,307
The public is alone.

52
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:39,875
They're talking about us.

53
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,077
It seeMs they change everything
and publish texts.

54
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:43,877
I have his poeMs.

55
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:47,646
Hold on to theM. In his current state
he's apt to leave theM anywhere.

56
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:49,713
Jacques, give theM back!

57
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,317
I'll knock you out!

58
00:06:55,195 --> 00:06:57,322
Will you calM down?
I hate scenes.

59
00:06:57,397 --> 00:06:59,058
Of course.

60
00:07:18,985 --> 00:07:20,509
Police?

61
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,147
The Poets' Cafe.
There's a brawl.

62
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:36,525
Good-bye.

63
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,295
Your cafe aMuses Me.

64
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:41,272
It thinks it's the center
of the universe.

65
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:42,865
It is.

66
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:46,036
You know it,
and that annoys you.

67
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,747
Is My case hopeless?

68
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:52,910
No. If it were,
they wouldn't hate you.

69
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,915
What should I do?

70
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:57,980
Fight theM?

71
00:08:00,426 --> 00:08:02,360
Astonish us.

72
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:46,835
Your papers.

73
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:55,873
My apologies, sir.
I didn't recognize you,

74
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:59,143
though My wife's rooM
is full of portraits of you.

75
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:02,287
- The gentleMan is with Me.
- My apologies once again.

76
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:07,250
You're in too well
with the police.

77
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,694
- Me?
- I advise you to disappear.

78
00:09:10,763 --> 00:09:13,493
You Might be blaMed
for this unpleasantness.

79
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,130
That's too Much!

80
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,128
Let Me go!

81
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:20,069
You have no right
to treat hiM like this!

82
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:22,437
- He has no papers.
- I vouch for hiM.

83
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:24,442
- You can explain it at the station.
- This is outrageous!

84
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,034
We're just doing our job.

85
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:28,774
Let Me go!

86
00:09:29,482 --> 00:09:31,507
ScuM! Swine!

87
00:09:31,584 --> 00:09:34,246
Let Me go!

88
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:38,751
- The little bastard bit Me!
- Watch out!

89
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:50,129
- Get the license nuMbers.
- We couldn't see theM.

90
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:51,534
Put the other units on alert.

91
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:01,511
Put hiM in My car and take care
of this pathetic crowd.

92
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:10,549
Heurtebise, help theM.

93
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:15,617
And to think it happened here,
where no one even passes through!

94
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:24,298
Don't stand there
like a laMppost.

95
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,129
Yes, you!

96
00:10:28,207 --> 00:10:29,936
Make yourself useful.

97
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:36,809
I need you as a witness.
Get in. Quick!

98
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:55,557
Give Me your handkerchief.

99
00:10:57,036 --> 00:10:59,004
He looks badly wounded.

100
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:04,071
Don't Make useless reMarks.

101
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:08,407
The hospital is behind us.

102
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:11,575
You don't think I'd take
this child to a hospital.

103
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:18,012
Don't touch hiM!

104
00:11:19,926 --> 00:11:21,484
But...

105
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:24,960
this young Man is dead.

106
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:27,691
Will you Mind
your own business?

107
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:30,325
When will you stop Meddling
in other people's business?

108
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:32,871
It was you who told Me
to coMe with you.

109
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:37,868
Will you please be quiet?

110
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,367
Take the usual route.

111
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,040
The radio.

112
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:22,747
S<i>ilence</i>

113
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:25,847
<i>goes faster backwards.</i>

114
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:27,756
<i>Three times.</i>

115
00:12:32,265 --> 00:12:33,823
<i>l repeat.</i>

116
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:41,834
Y<i>our attention, please.</i>

117
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:45,574
<i>A single glass of water</i>
<i>lights up the world.</i>

118
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:49,046
- Where are we going?
- Must I force you to be quiet?

119
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:52,947
<i>A single glass of water</i>
<i>lights the world.</i>

120
00:12:53,686 --> 00:12:55,984
<i>Twice. l repeat.</i>

121
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:10,934
Hello there!

122
00:13:19,145 --> 00:13:23,081
But... those are the Men
who knocked this boy down.

123
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,043
You're being stupid.

124
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:27,751
Please, ask Me no More questions.

125
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:16,329
Get out and let My Men work.

126
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:22,731
Take the body out of the car
and take it up there.

127
00:14:59,912 --> 00:15:01,903
Are you sleepwalking?

128
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:06,949
I Must be.

129
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:20,127
Everyone is dawdling.
I don't like it when people do that.

130
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:24,135
Wait for Me here,
young man.

131
00:15:38,718 --> 00:15:40,982
Lay hiM on the floor.

132
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,628
Follow Me.

133
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,762
You're clearly asleep.

134
00:15:56,102 --> 00:15:58,536
Yes, I'M asleep.

135
00:15:58,971 --> 00:16:00,996
It's very strange.

136
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:06,001
- You Must explain--
- No, I won't.

137
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:10,405
Sleeping or dreaMing, the dreaMer
Must accept his dreaMs.

138
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:12,814
I have a right
to ask for an explanation.

139
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:15,648
You have every right, My dear Man,
and so do I...

140
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:17,621
so we're even.

141
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:19,691
Turn off that Music!

142
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,688
There's a dead Man in the next rooM
and the Men who killed hiM.

143
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:28,530
- I repeat... I deMand-
- And I deMand you not touch that radio!

144
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:32,267
- M<i>essage.</i>: <i>The mirrors would do well...</i>
- CalM down and have a seat.

145
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:35,136
<i>to re</i>fl<i>ect further.</i>

146
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,608
<i>Three times.</i>

147
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,481
You're unbearable.

148
00:16:48,054 --> 00:16:50,181
Sit down.

149
00:16:50,856 --> 00:16:52,790
Wait for Me in this rooM.

150
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:55,620
My servants will bring you
soMe chaMpagne and cigarettes.

151
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:57,526
Make yourself at hoMe.

152
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:03,064
You try too hard to understand
what's going on, My dear young Man,

153
00:17:03,135 --> 00:17:04,625
and that's a serious Mistake.

154
00:17:04,704 --> 00:17:07,798
But they expect Me at hoMe.

155
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:09,397
Let your wife wait.

156
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:12,572
She'll be all the More pleased
when you return.

157
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:27,258
- Is everything ready?
- Yes, Ma'aM.

158
00:17:32,531 --> 00:17:34,931
Cegeste, get up.

159
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:39,900
Hello.

160
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:41,439
Hello.

161
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:43,975
- Do you know who I aM?
- I do.

162
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:46,841
- Say it.
- My death.

163
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:50,243
Good. FroM now on
you will serve Me.

164
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:52,045
I will serve you.

165
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:55,519
- You will obey My orders.
- I will obey your orders.

166
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:57,249
Excellent.

167
00:17:57,757 --> 00:17:59,384
Now, coMe with Me.

168
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,351
Hold on to My dress.

169
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:05,088
Do not be afraid.
Don't let go.

170
00:20:04,183 --> 00:20:05,946
Where are we?

171
00:20:09,054 --> 00:20:11,318
- I said where are we!
- I don't know.

172
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,857
I'M supposed to wait for you
and take you back.

173
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:15,086
Where is the princess?
Where is the villa?

174
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,720
Sir, if you will kindly
get in the car--

175
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,213
Yes, yes!

176
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:41,583
The woMan was staying
at the TherMal Hotel.

177
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:43,344
Call the Manager for Me.

178
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:45,454
They want to speak
to the Manager.

179
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:54,589
This is the chief inspector speaking.

180
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,464
I'M sorry to trouble you again.

181
00:20:56,602 --> 00:20:58,832
<i>Have you conducted</i>
<i>your investigation?</i>

182
00:20:58,904 --> 00:21:00,963
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

183
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:05,340
I can only repeat
what I've told you, Inspector.

184
00:21:05,477 --> 00:21:08,105
There is no woMan here
fiitting that description,

185
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:09,974
nor have I seen any Rolls-Royces.

186
00:21:10,082 --> 00:21:12,607
I'll drop by at 2:00.

187
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,986
It's unbelievable.

188
00:21:19,124 --> 00:21:22,890
Not at the TherMal,
not at the Fabius,

189
00:21:23,896 --> 00:21:25,921
and not at the Two Worlds.

190
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:29,596
He'll never coMe back.

191
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:31,926
There, there, calM down.

192
00:21:32,004 --> 00:21:33,869
Men always coMe back.

193
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:36,169
They're so absurd!

194
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:38,868
But where is he?
Where can he be?

195
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:42,242
There's no point in lying to you.
He's with that woMan.

196
00:21:42,481 --> 00:21:44,346
No, no! I don't believe it!

197
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:48,079
Inspector, tell her it's not true.
You know Orpheus!

198
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:52,084
- Tell her it's not true.
- It's diffiicult to say.

199
00:21:52,157 --> 00:21:55,718
Yours is a perfect Marriage,
but soMetiMes Men lose their heads.

200
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:06,433
- It's a Messy story.
- Will the press create a scandal?

201
00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:09,406
No, I gave strict orders.

202
00:22:09,475 --> 00:22:12,205
Besides, the reporters
don't know anything yet.

203
00:22:22,888 --> 00:22:25,755
- It's a reporter, Inspector.
- What?

204
00:22:27,092 --> 00:22:28,923
What is it?

205
00:22:37,236 --> 00:22:40,569
I've been sent by the S<i>un.</i>
Is your husband in?

206
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:43,608
My husband can't be disturbed.
He's sleeping.

207
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:45,735
He worked all night.

208
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:48,803
I caMe by to see hiM,
but I didn't want to disturb hiM.

209
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:51,810
Fine. I'll go then. Can I drop you off
soMewhere, Inspector?

210
00:22:51,884 --> 00:22:54,512
- Not necessary. I have My car.
- What was it you wanted?

211
00:22:54,753 --> 00:22:56,550
I wanted to talk to hiM
about the accident.

212
00:22:56,622 --> 00:22:59,420
The young Man is not at the hospital,
and his friends are concerned.

213
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:02,221
Everything's fiine.
I'll stop by your offiice.

214
00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:12,198
Well done!

215
00:23:12,638 --> 00:23:14,902
This is terrible!

216
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:18,404
Let's not panic.

217
00:23:18,477 --> 00:23:20,775
I'll stop by the offiice
and speak with theM.

218
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:22,404
CoMe now. Be strong.

219
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:40,325
Follow Me, and be as quiet
as possible.

220
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:45,599
I'll open the garage.

221
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:19,936
Then it's agreed?

222
00:24:21,173 --> 00:24:23,539
My wife would never understand.

223
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,380
I'M a reporter froM the S<i>un.</i>

224
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:34,984
So you're asleep, huh?

225
00:24:35,154 --> 00:24:38,248
I'll let you sleep on, Orpheus.
Pleasant dreaMs!

226
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:39,620
Get out of here!

227
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:41,784
My newspaper will take
your attitude into account.

228
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,327
Clear out.

229
00:24:43,395 --> 00:24:46,660
- You'll regret this!
- To hell with the press!

230
00:24:46,732 --> 00:24:48,962
- That's soMething new.
- Yes, it's new.

231
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:51,663
Eurydice, he's back!

232
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:58,334
- What are you doing here?
- CharMing!

233
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:01,907
Orpheus, if you abandon your wife,
it's only norMal

234
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,380
that she should call on those
who love her.

235
00:25:05,017 --> 00:25:07,747
I was frantic with worry.
I called Aglaonice.

236
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:09,979
And the inspector?

237
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:12,888
I don't think you realize
how serious the situation is.

238
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:15,119
What I realize is that I coMe hoMe
and fiind the police

239
00:25:15,194 --> 00:25:17,492
and a woMan whoM I've forbidden
to ever enter My house!

240
00:25:18,463 --> 00:25:20,795
You've gone too far
with your bad Manners.

241
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:23,130
You'll live to regret
those words!

242
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:26,601
CoMing, Inspector?

243
00:25:26,672 --> 00:25:28,936
You seeM as unwelcoMe
as I aM.

244
00:25:29,007 --> 00:25:31,635
Go on. I'M not detaining you.

245
00:25:31,977 --> 00:25:35,003
You're to coMe to My offiice
toMorrow.

246
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:44,478
Aglaonice is dangerous!

247
00:25:44,556 --> 00:25:47,423
Her League of WoMen is powerful.
You're crazy!

248
00:25:47,492 --> 00:25:50,484
Perhaps I aM <i>going</i> Mad.

249
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:53,354
- Where were you!
- Oh, that!

250
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,731
No cross-exaMinations, please!

251
00:25:58,937 --> 00:26:01,701
But you've never stayed out all night.
It's only natural that I ask you--

252
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:04,606
Nothing!
Ask Me nothing!

253
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,910
Orpheus, you never drink!

254
00:26:09,014 --> 00:26:11,505
I do now! Do you Mind?

255
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,084
And here I was waiting
for you to coMe hoMe

256
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:22,552
to tell you soMe great news!

257
00:26:22,694 --> 00:26:25,492
I don't want to hear
any More stories!

258
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:28,795
I especially don't want to hear
any news!

259
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:31,631
The news I get is always bad news,
and I'M tired of it!

260
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,538
Leave Me alone.
I want to sleep!

261
00:27:22,654 --> 00:27:26,351
- Who are you?
- I brought your husband back.

262
00:27:27,592 --> 00:27:29,457
Where was he?

263
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:32,292
I'M the chauffeur for the woMan
whose car he got in yesterday.

264
00:27:32,364 --> 00:27:34,025
Did he spend the night
with her?

265
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:35,963
No, Ma'aM.

266
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:38,059
My eMployer was transporting
a badly wounded Man.

267
00:27:38,136 --> 00:27:40,502
Your husband was at the scene
and got in the car.

268
00:27:41,707 --> 00:27:44,540
But My boss doesn't like
people Meddling in her affairs.

269
00:27:44,943 --> 00:27:46,570
And so?

270
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:49,307
She left us on the road.

271
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:52,316
She had a sMall car waiting for her
near her villa.

272
00:27:52,384 --> 00:27:54,375
She drove off on her own
with the wounded Man.

273
00:27:54,453 --> 00:27:55,886
And My husband?

274
00:27:55,954 --> 00:27:58,218
I had a probleM
with a loose connection.

275
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,224
It was better to wait
till day.

276
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:02,652
Your husband slept
in the car.

277
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:05,227
He was very worried
about you.

278
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:08,058
I'd like to believe it.

279
00:28:09,568 --> 00:28:12,799
I Might lie to you if I were
a real chauffeur, but I'M not.

280
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:15,800
- What are you?
- A student-- without a penny.

281
00:28:15,974 --> 00:28:18,534
I only got the job
two weeks ago.

282
00:28:18,643 --> 00:28:20,907
My naMe is Heurtebise.

283
00:28:22,614 --> 00:28:24,275
You Make Me feel better.

284
00:28:24,349 --> 00:28:27,341
- Do you know My husband?
- Who doesn't?

285
00:28:27,686 --> 00:28:30,883
My husband adores Me...
and now we've had a fiight.

286
00:28:30,956 --> 00:28:33,982
He's not hiMself.
He's been drinking.

287
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:40,528
You dropped your work.

288
00:28:43,201 --> 00:28:45,066
I was going to tell hiM
the big news.

289
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:48,231
He wouldn't listen.
He saw nothing and heard nothing.

290
00:28:48,507 --> 00:28:50,907
He stepped right on it
without even noticing.

291
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:54,272
He's tired.
It's hard to sleep in a car.

292
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,211
Perhaps it's that.
He said he wanted to sleep.

293
00:28:58,984 --> 00:29:01,475
But you Must be exhausted.

294
00:29:01,686 --> 00:29:03,847
I'll Make soMe coffee for you.

295
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:08,919
Where are you supposed to Meet
your eMployer?

296
00:29:08,994 --> 00:29:11,360
Forgive Me-- your ''lady.''

297
00:29:12,297 --> 00:29:13,787
Sit down.

298
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,865
I have no orders.

299
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:19,200
I'll wait for her in town.

300
00:29:19,271 --> 00:29:21,068
Stay here if you like.

301
00:29:21,139 --> 00:29:23,937
There's a little rooM
above the garage.

302
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:26,102
It's not Much,
I'M warning you,

303
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:29,773
but you can park your car
next to ours and wait.

304
00:29:30,682 --> 00:29:32,172
Tell the truth.

305
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,016
You want Me under your thuMb
because I'M part of the story.

306
00:29:36,788 --> 00:29:39,086
Nevertheless,
you are charMing.

307
00:29:39,191 --> 00:29:42,524
You're wrong.
I'M very ordinary.

308
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:49,062
You Must realize
that woMen like Me

309
00:29:49,134 --> 00:29:51,432
have Much to fear
froM certain people.

310
00:29:51,503 --> 00:29:54,370
Your husband wouldn't
lose his head easily.

311
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,841
He's very handsoMe
and very faMous.

312
00:29:57,943 --> 00:30:01,276
It's a Miracle that he's still
faithful to Me.

313
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,359
- Please, forgive Me.
- The gas!

314
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:19,621
- What about it?
- It's still on. Be careful.

315
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:23,991
I dislike that sMell...

316
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:25,934
and for good reason.

317
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:29,073
I coMMitted suicide
by gassing Myself.

318
00:30:29,141 --> 00:30:31,371
Since My death,
the sMell has pursued Me.

319
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:32,910
Your death?

320
00:30:32,978 --> 00:30:36,914
I Mean... since I alMost
coMMitted suicide.

321
00:30:36,982 --> 00:30:39,143
You don't look like a ghost.

322
00:30:39,217 --> 00:30:42,550
I was in love with a girl.
She was quite Mean.

323
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:46,188
It's a pity
she wasn't like you.

324
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:50,758
- Your naMe is Eurydice, right?
- At your service.

325
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:52,920
But I've forgotten yours.

326
00:30:52,998 --> 00:30:55,262
Heurtebise, at your service.

327
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,036
<i>The bird sings with its fingers.</i>

328
00:30:59,404 --> 00:31:00,803
<i>Once.</i>

329
00:31:00,872 --> 00:31:02,339
<i>l repeat.</i>

330
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:50,485
<i>And that first night</i>

331
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:53,854
<i>Orpheus'death</i>
<i>entered his room</i>

332
00:31:53,925 --> 00:31:55,586
<i>and watched him sleep.</i>

333
00:32:19,884 --> 00:32:21,647
<i>Two days later...</i>

334
00:32:23,355 --> 00:32:25,414
There are other radios
besides this one.

335
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,117
I can't get this station
anywhere else.

336
00:32:27,192 --> 00:32:29,660
I see I'll have to live
in the car.

337
00:32:29,728 --> 00:32:33,129
- Nobody's forcing you!
- Darling--

338
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:35,466
<i>38...</i>

339
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:38,025
<i>39...</i>

340
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:40,094
<i>40.</i>

341
00:32:40,171 --> 00:32:42,002
<i>Twice.</i>

342
00:32:42,107 --> 00:32:43,665
<i>l repeat.</i>

343
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:56,485
SeeMs like nothing
but Meaningless words to Me.

344
00:32:56,821 --> 00:32:59,085
But there was
a terrifiic Message yesterday.

345
00:32:59,224 --> 00:33:00,748
Rest awhile.

346
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:03,419
So the Messages can start again
as soon as I turn My back? Thanks.

347
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:06,887
You can't spend your life
in a talking car.

348
00:33:06,965 --> 00:33:10,230
- It Makes no sense.
- No sense?

349
00:33:12,003 --> 00:33:14,130
My life had begun to pass
its peak.

350
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:17,968
It was rotting,
stinking of success and of death.

351
00:33:18,043 --> 00:33:21,604
The least of these phrases
is Much More than any of My poeMs.

352
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:25,744
I'd give all that I've written
for even one of those little phrases.

353
00:33:27,252 --> 00:33:29,015
I'M on the trail
of the unknown.

354
00:33:29,087 --> 00:33:33,319
Orpheus, little phrases
won't feed our child.

355
00:33:33,525 --> 00:33:36,016
There's a woMan for you,
Heurtebise.

356
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:38,589
You discover a world

357
00:33:38,663 --> 00:33:41,393
and she speaks to you
of baby clothes and bills.

358
00:33:43,601 --> 00:33:44,966
I adMire Orpheus.

359
00:33:45,036 --> 00:33:48,699
I could have listened a thousand tiMes
and not paid the slightest attention.

360
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:52,305
Where could they be coMing froM,
Heurtebise?

361
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,876
They're on no other station.

362
00:33:55,613 --> 00:33:57,911
I'M certain they're Meant
for Me.

363
00:33:57,982 --> 00:34:00,542
Orpheus, nothing Matters
but this car.

364
00:34:00,618 --> 00:34:02,813
I could die
and you wouldn't even notice.

365
00:34:02,887 --> 00:34:05,822
We were dead
and we didn't notice.

366
00:34:06,191 --> 00:34:08,659
Beware of the Sirens!

367
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,091
It is <i>l</i> who charM <i>them</i>.

368
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:13,221
Your voice is very beautiful.

369
00:34:13,298 --> 00:34:15,095
Be satisfiied with your voice.

370
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:17,895
<i>Attention.</i>

371
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:20,938
<i>2,294. Twice.</i>

372
00:34:21,306 --> 00:34:23,137
What fascinating poetry!

373
00:34:23,308 --> 00:34:25,833
Who can say what's poetry
and what isn't?

374
00:34:26,277 --> 00:34:28,507
Besides, if you're not happy,
you don't have to stay.

375
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,844
I just want to be left
in peace, that's all.

376
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:34,111
Take her away.
She'll drive Me Mad.

377
00:34:34,786 --> 00:34:36,276
That car will drive you Mad.

378
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:39,380
Take her away, Heurtebise,
or I'll do soMething I'll regret!

379
00:34:43,027 --> 00:34:44,654
Orpheus was horrible.

380
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:48,597
No, he's a genius,
and every genius has his Moods.

381
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:53,663
It's not that talking car
that I fear.

382
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:55,197
It's what he's looking for.

383
00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:57,241
But he'd be the saMe
with that woMan.

384
00:34:57,308 --> 00:34:59,503
All he's interested in
is those phrases.

385
00:35:00,078 --> 00:35:03,138
Heurtebise, I May be silly

386
00:35:03,214 --> 00:35:05,182
but I feel things.

387
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:08,143
It's the fiirst tiMe
he's treated Me like a dog.

388
00:35:08,386 --> 00:35:12,413
Don't exaggerate.
It's just a little faMily quarrel.

389
00:35:13,258 --> 00:35:15,283
It starts with little
faMily quarrels.

390
00:35:15,927 --> 00:35:19,124
You're going to lie down
and close your eyes.

391
00:35:23,935 --> 00:35:26,199
Would you answer it for Me?

392
00:35:38,116 --> 00:35:39,811
Yes, this is Orpheus' house.

393
00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:42,317
No, this is not Orpheus.

394
00:35:43,788 --> 00:35:46,086
Yes, Inspector.

395
00:35:46,157 --> 00:35:48,887
Yes, I'll give hiM your Message.

396
00:35:56,668 --> 00:35:59,364
The inspector called.
He's expecting you.

397
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:02,429
- And your wife doesn't feel well.
- It's natural in her condition.

398
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:06,102
- Go see her.
- All right. Would you get the car out?

399
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:07,872
- My car?
- No, Mine.

400
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:10,437
No one Must suspect
the other car is here.

401
00:36:10,515 --> 00:36:12,506
The whole town knows
that car.

402
00:36:29,033 --> 00:36:30,898
What's wrong?

403
00:36:31,102 --> 00:36:33,866
- Don't you feel well?
- Very well.

404
00:36:34,973 --> 00:36:37,498
- Would you like Me to get you a nurse?
- A nurse?

405
00:36:37,942 --> 00:36:41,139
I can't leave you all alone.
I have to go into town.

406
00:36:41,479 --> 00:36:43,777
I won't be alone.

407
00:36:43,848 --> 00:36:45,509
Forgive My bad teMper.

408
00:36:47,151 --> 00:36:49,551
I've been resting
on My laurels.

409
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:51,555
I've got to wake up.

410
00:36:51,623 --> 00:36:53,648
CoMe hoMe quickly.

411
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:03,666
Do you forgive Me?
I'M all nerves.

412
00:37:24,756 --> 00:37:27,190
What is it?
Did I scare you?

413
00:37:27,492 --> 00:37:30,723
I'M all on edge.
I couldn't drive.

414
00:37:30,795 --> 00:37:32,922
Aren't you afraid they Might
recognize Me if I drive?

415
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:36,797
You can drop Me off and wait soMewhere
where no one will recognize you.

416
00:37:50,682 --> 00:37:52,445
I'M going to the police station,
and then I'll be back.

417
00:37:52,517 --> 00:37:55,452
One never knows if one will return
froM the police station.

418
00:37:56,054 --> 00:37:58,045
Very funny.

419
00:39:06,624 --> 00:39:09,616
Excuse Me. Have you seen
a dark-haired woMan pass by?

420
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:31,448
Hello, Orpheus.
Hot under the collar?

421
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:34,912
Excuse Me--

422
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:50,157
Have you seen a young woMan
pass by?

423
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:52,259
Chasing girls, Orpheus?

424
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:54,770
She's very thin and very sMart,
and she walks very fast.

425
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,534
That's Me!

426
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,874
- Orpheus, your autograph, please.
- I don't have the tiMe.

427
00:40:01,946 --> 00:40:04,642
- Please, sign My book!
- I don't have anything to write with.

428
00:40:04,716 --> 00:40:06,616
Monique, lend Me your pen.

429
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:10,080
It's hiM, it's hiM!

430
00:40:15,259 --> 00:40:17,250
Let Me go!

431
00:40:19,797 --> 00:40:21,355
Idiot!

432
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:27,128
Over here! CoMe quick!

433
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:29,763
I see why he steers clear of us.
Read this.

434
00:40:37,982 --> 00:40:40,849
A very annoying article.

435
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,489
Speak one at a tiMe
or we'll never get anywhere.

436
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:50,520
You were saying, sir,
that this phrase is a poeM.

437
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,624
No one should know
better than you.

438
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,634
Go ahead and speak.

439
00:40:57,869 --> 00:41:00,929
Orpheus sent Me the texts
yesterday Morning.

440
00:41:01,038 --> 00:41:03,438
I found theM
quite astonishing.

441
00:41:03,741 --> 00:41:06,005
I showed theM
to My friends.

442
00:41:06,077 --> 00:41:10,776
I noticed that one of theM--
quite an astonishing one--

443
00:41:10,848 --> 00:41:11,940
reMinded Me of soMething.

444
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:14,217
I believe this is the text.

445
00:41:14,652 --> 00:41:18,019
''The bird sings with its fiingers.''

446
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:19,488
I believe that's how it reads.

447
00:41:19,557 --> 00:41:22,185
On the day of the accident,
the guy was sMashed.

448
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,750
Are you speaking
of the victiM?

449
00:41:23,828 --> 00:41:26,058
Jacques Cegeste.
He was to give us a poeM.

450
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:29,725
<i>A</i>ft<i>er the brawl, l found these pages</i>
<i>at The Poets' Cafe.</i>

451
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:32,599
He wrote the phrase
you have in your hand.

452
00:41:32,804 --> 00:41:35,170
Orpheus didn't know Cegeste.

453
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:38,106
He was sitting with Me when he saw
Cegeste for the fiirst tiMe.

454
00:41:38,509 --> 00:41:41,706
The young Man disappears
under tragic circuMstances,

455
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:45,044
and his poeM coMes back to us
through Orpheus, who was in the car

456
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,916
and who claiMs he doesn't know
what becaMe of Cegeste.

457
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:52,820
MadaM, you run
a woMen's club, ''The Bacchantes.''

458
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,017
There's late-night drinking
that goes on there.

459
00:41:55,092 --> 00:41:57,788
-Just chaMpagne, Inspector.
- That's right.

460
00:41:57,862 --> 00:41:59,352
What can you tell Me?

461
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:02,263
Orpheus Married
one of My forMer serving girls.

462
00:42:02,466 --> 00:42:03,899
We're very fond of her.

463
00:42:04,569 --> 00:42:06,503
When she's sad,
she coMes to us.

464
00:42:06,737 --> 00:42:09,535
She told us
she was very unhappy.

465
00:42:09,941 --> 00:42:13,672
Ladies and gentleMen, I don't doubt
your good faith for a MoMent,

466
00:42:13,744 --> 00:42:16,440
nor your wish to assist justice.

467
00:42:16,514 --> 00:42:20,746
But this evidence is too fliMsy
to accuse a national hero...

468
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:22,149
Orpheus!

469
00:42:22,353 --> 00:42:25,720
Don't forget we call
a fanfare of truMpets

470
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,280
''Orphean Music.''

471
00:42:28,726 --> 00:42:30,887
Ladies, gentleMen--

472
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:33,931
To hell with national heroes!
We'll take care of justice ourselves!

473
00:42:34,532 --> 00:42:38,332
I'M expecting Orpheus at any MoMent.
I'M sure he'll explain--

474
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:41,200
If justice refuses to intervene,
then we will.

475
00:42:41,405 --> 00:42:42,394
Good-bye, Inspector.

476
00:42:42,473 --> 00:42:45,169
GentleMen, gentleMen!

477
00:42:51,215 --> 00:42:52,876
Did you read the article?

478
00:42:53,651 --> 00:42:56,643
- No, and I won't read it.
- You're right. It's horrible.

479
00:42:56,888 --> 00:42:58,913
Don't Mention it to My wife.

480
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,651
Did you see a lot of people?

481
00:43:02,994 --> 00:43:05,554
It seeMed to Me that the streets
were oddly eMpty.

482
00:43:05,663 --> 00:43:08,598
All I found were girls
asking for autographs.

483
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:11,793
- And you?
- No. Wait-- yes! My eMployer.

484
00:43:11,903 --> 00:43:13,393
She passed by
in a convertible.

485
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:16,235
She slowed down and shouted to Me
that the Rolls was fiine at your place,

486
00:43:16,307 --> 00:43:17,968
and that I should wait for her.

487
00:43:18,042 --> 00:43:20,533
You should have gone after her,
shouted for her to stop.

488
00:43:20,611 --> 00:43:24,638
A chauffeur doesn't give orders.
He only takes theM.

489
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:26,714
Did she give you any orders?

490
00:43:26,784 --> 00:43:28,752
No. She told Me to wait for orders
at your place.

491
00:43:28,819 --> 00:43:31,845
- What did the inspector tell you?
- I didn't go to see hiM. He can wait.

492
00:43:39,864 --> 00:43:42,628
<i>Each night, Orpheus'death</i>

493
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,066
<i>returned to his room.</i>

494
00:43:50,441 --> 00:43:53,205
- No, Eurydice, no!
- I Must go, Heurtebise.

495
00:43:53,344 --> 00:43:55,642
I'll go to Aglaonice.
I Must!

496
00:43:55,846 --> 00:43:57,711
She's the only one
who can advise Me.

497
00:43:57,782 --> 00:44:00,046
Orpheus would not like it!

498
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:02,483
He doesn't care about anything
but that woMan's car.

499
00:44:02,553 --> 00:44:06,284
Even if I drove you, he'd see you.
He's in the garage.

500
00:44:06,357 --> 00:44:08,757
I'll take My bicycle.
I do it all the tiMe.

501
00:44:08,826 --> 00:44:11,659
- In your condition it's crazy!
- I'M going!

502
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:18,367
I don't have the authority
to forbid you,

503
00:44:19,337 --> 00:44:21,134
but what if I begged you?

504
00:44:21,205 --> 00:44:22,832
I'd still go.

505
00:44:22,907 --> 00:44:25,501
It wouldn't stop Me.
I'M going Mad!

506
00:44:28,479 --> 00:44:30,947
Aglaonice can't tell you
anything new

507
00:44:31,015 --> 00:44:33,210
and you'll be dead tired.

508
00:45:20,965 --> 00:45:22,796
Hello.

509
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:28,530
CoMe along, Cegeste.
Get used to following Me.

510
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,035
- Close the door.
- What door?

511
00:45:32,109 --> 00:45:34,907
The Mirror! You never understand
what you're told.

512
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:41,445
The Mirror and the trapdoor.

513
00:45:44,321 --> 00:45:45,982
Is everything all right?

514
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,319
That depends.

515
00:45:50,227 --> 00:45:52,752
What do you Mean by that?

516
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:55,155
Nothing, Ma'aM.

517
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:57,097
Good.

518
00:45:57,168 --> 00:46:00,035
I can't stand iMpertinence.

519
00:46:01,205 --> 00:46:02,797
Is Orpheus in the garage?

520
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,767
Yes, Ma'aM.

521
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:09,311
Well, now, Cegeste,

522
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:11,943
what does that look Mean?

523
00:46:12,116 --> 00:46:15,711
Perhaps you expected to see Me
with a scythe and a shroud?

524
00:46:17,688 --> 00:46:20,816
My boy, if I appeared to the living
the way they portray Me,

525
00:46:21,325 --> 00:46:23,316
they would recognize Me,

526
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:26,256
and that wouldn't Make
our task easy.

527
00:46:26,897 --> 00:46:29,764
Heurtebise will help you.
You'd never Manage on your own.

528
00:46:30,734 --> 00:46:33,897
I'll close the curtains Myself
since none of you have bothered to.

529
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:38,408
Leave nothing on the table
except the transMitter.

530
00:46:38,943 --> 00:46:41,036
Cegeste, send the Messages.

531
00:46:41,178 --> 00:46:43,772
CoMe on, get a Move on!

532
00:46:45,382 --> 00:46:47,748
Not drinking doesn't suit you.

533
00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:49,786
I have no tiMe to lose.

534
00:46:50,788 --> 00:46:53,689
''The Mourning of young widows

535
00:46:54,058 --> 00:46:56,583
is as brief as a noonday candle.''

536
00:46:56,694 --> 00:46:59,390
Once. I repeat.

537
00:47:05,302 --> 00:47:08,931
Your phrases are an exquisite
stroke of inspiration.

538
00:47:11,675 --> 00:47:12,903
Thank you.

539
00:47:13,611 --> 00:47:16,603
- Where are My gloves?
- They're not in the bag.

540
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:21,278
Did you forget theM?
That's the last straw!

541
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:24,410
Yes, Ma'aM. I'M sorry.

542
00:47:26,023 --> 00:47:28,719
I knew it. Give Me yours,
Quickly!

543
00:47:31,428 --> 00:47:34,261
You know I deMand
absolute discipline

544
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:36,458
like on a ship.

545
00:47:43,607 --> 00:47:45,404
Do you have orders?

546
00:47:48,646 --> 00:47:50,136
What did you say?

547
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:53,372
I asked you
if you had orders.

548
00:47:54,451 --> 00:47:58,182
When I carry out My orders,
I expect Mine to be carried out.

549
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:00,723
That's exactly why I ask
if you have orders.

550
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:02,622
You dare to ask?

551
00:48:03,294 --> 00:48:06,559
If you had had orders, your butchers
would have coMpleted their task.

552
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:10,599
Are you in love
with this idiot?

553
00:48:11,669 --> 00:48:13,136
What if I aM?

554
00:48:13,204 --> 00:48:16,105
You have no right to love
in <i>any</i> world.

555
00:48:16,173 --> 00:48:18,869
- Nor do you.
- What?

556
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:22,206
- You can't escape the rules.
- I order you to be quiet!

557
00:48:23,113 --> 00:48:26,048
You're in love with Orpheus
and you don't know how to handle it.

558
00:48:26,116 --> 00:48:28,050
Shut up!

559
00:48:30,387 --> 00:48:31,979
TransMit your Messages.

560
00:48:32,489 --> 00:48:34,320
Make soMething up--
anything!

561
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:38,222
Could I appear and disappear
like Heurtebise?

562
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:40,762
You're too cluMsy.
TransMit.

563
00:48:44,134 --> 00:48:46,694
''Jupiter gives wisdoM

564
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,294
to those he would lose.

565
00:48:48,372 --> 00:48:49,862
I repeat.''

566
00:48:54,678 --> 00:48:56,646
Orpheus! Orpheus!

567
00:48:58,215 --> 00:49:00,547
What? Can't I ever
be left alone?

568
00:49:00,951 --> 00:49:03,181
Your wife is in great danger.

569
00:49:03,254 --> 00:49:04,744
- Follow Me.
- Be quiet!

570
00:49:05,222 --> 00:49:07,452
I'M telling you,
your wife is in great danger.

571
00:49:07,524 --> 00:49:10,357
- I can't hear.
- Will you listen to Me?

572
00:49:11,395 --> 00:49:13,192
Let Me fiinish writing this.

573
00:49:15,532 --> 00:49:17,898
Orpheus, your wife is dying!

574
00:49:19,336 --> 00:49:20,769
You don't know her.

575
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:23,471
It's just a trick to get Me
back in the house.

576
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,751
Get up.

577
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,140
Do you know who I aM?

578
00:49:59,209 --> 00:50:01,234
- I do.
- Say it.

579
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:03,476
My death.

580
00:50:03,547 --> 00:50:06,209
FroM now on
you belong to the other world.

581
00:50:06,283 --> 00:50:08,808
FroM now on I belong
to the other world.

582
00:50:08,886 --> 00:50:12,185
- You will obey My orders.
- I will obey.

583
00:50:12,256 --> 00:50:13,780
Excellent.

584
00:50:14,958 --> 00:50:16,687
Ah, there you are.

585
00:50:17,394 --> 00:50:19,555
Orpheus Must have refused
to follow you.

586
00:50:20,631 --> 00:50:22,565
I will report this.

587
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,168
And so will I.

588
00:50:25,336 --> 00:50:26,894
I have a lot to say.

589
00:50:30,074 --> 00:50:32,201
Don't forget the apparatus.
You forget everything!

590
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:36,771
I suppose, Heurtebise, that you want
to stay on Earth?

591
00:50:38,082 --> 00:50:41,176
You look like a gravedigger
in that trapdoor.

592
00:50:41,785 --> 00:50:43,844
You are quite ridiculous!

593
00:50:44,288 --> 00:50:46,051
I'M not the only one!

594
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:50,759
I'll Make a note
of your insolence.

595
00:50:52,796 --> 00:50:53,785
Cegeste!

596
00:50:55,499 --> 00:50:58,434
Won't you ever learn
not to look back?

597
00:50:58,736 --> 00:51:02,228
People have been turned
into a pillar of salt for that!

598
00:51:06,076 --> 00:51:07,668
Let's go.

599
00:51:42,012 --> 00:51:44,310
I warned you.
You're too late.

600
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:46,372
- Too late?
- CoMe up.

601
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:49,180
What are you doing
in My rooM?

602
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,919
CoMe in through the window
you fiind so handy for cliMbing out.

603
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:05,534
I asked you what you're doing
in My rooM.

604
00:52:06,103 --> 00:52:09,266
- Your wife.
- What about My wife?

605
00:52:10,073 --> 00:52:12,439
Your wife is dead.

606
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:14,477
You're joking.

607
00:52:14,845 --> 00:52:17,245
That would be
a strange joke.

608
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:21,279
You refused to listen to Me.

609
00:52:26,657 --> 00:52:28,352
Eurydice.

610
00:52:28,425 --> 00:52:30,325
Orpheus, listen to Me.

611
00:52:35,532 --> 00:52:38,000
It's too late for regrets.

612
00:52:38,435 --> 00:52:39,925
Listen to Me.

613
00:52:40,771 --> 00:52:43,001
But how...

614
00:52:43,507 --> 00:52:45,236
and why?

615
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:48,874
She had a bad fall

616
00:52:49,513 --> 00:52:52,380
and, I suspect,
other things as well.

617
00:52:52,449 --> 00:52:55,111
But what?

618
00:53:01,558 --> 00:53:03,458
It's not possible.

619
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:07,295
Talk to Me.

620
00:53:07,998 --> 00:53:10,432
Look at Me.

621
00:53:10,501 --> 00:53:13,959
There's one way to undo
your foolishness.

622
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:19,565
This is part
of the saMe dreaM,

623
00:53:20,911 --> 00:53:22,674
the saMe nightMare.

624
00:53:22,746 --> 00:53:24,714
But I'll wake up--
SoMebody wake Me up!

625
00:53:24,781 --> 00:53:26,373
Listen to Me.

626
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:29,248
Will you listen to Me,
Orpheus?

627
00:53:30,387 --> 00:53:32,548
It's all useless.

628
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:35,183
You have one chance left.

629
00:53:36,193 --> 00:53:37,490
What chance?

630
00:53:39,863 --> 00:53:42,024
Orpheus, you know Death.

631
00:53:42,799 --> 00:53:45,165
I've spoken of her...

632
00:53:45,502 --> 00:53:47,299
I've dreaMt of her...

633
00:53:48,305 --> 00:53:50,364
I've sung about her.

634
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,102
I thought I knew her...

635
00:53:54,878 --> 00:53:56,311
but I didn't know her.

636
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:00,009
You know her... in person!

637
00:54:01,285 --> 00:54:03,310
In person?

638
00:54:03,854 --> 00:54:06,254
You have been with her.

639
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:08,285
With her?

640
00:54:08,358 --> 00:54:11,759
In her rooM.
In her very rooM!

641
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:15,160
- The princess?
- That's right.

642
00:54:16,033 --> 00:54:17,864
My God!

643
00:54:20,137 --> 00:54:22,264
The Mirror.

644
00:54:22,506 --> 00:54:24,804
I'll give you
the secret of secrets.

645
00:54:25,075 --> 00:54:28,306
Mirrors are the doors
through which Death coMes and goes.

646
00:54:30,314 --> 00:54:33,147
Look at yourself in a Mirror
all your life...

647
00:54:33,283 --> 00:54:35,683
and you'll see death at work

648
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:38,685
like bees in a hive of glass.

649
00:54:43,994 --> 00:54:47,555
How do you know
these frightening things?

650
00:54:48,365 --> 00:54:50,424
Don't be naive.

651
00:54:51,034 --> 00:54:55,334
Could I be her chauffeur without
learning certain frightening things?

652
00:54:56,573 --> 00:55:00,236
Heurtebise, there's nothing More
to be done.

653
00:55:01,178 --> 00:55:03,646
Yes, there is.
Find her again.

654
00:55:05,282 --> 00:55:07,512
No Man can do that

655
00:55:08,619 --> 00:55:09,916
unless he kills hiMself.

656
00:55:09,987 --> 00:55:12,114
A poet is More than a Man.

657
00:55:12,255 --> 00:55:14,689
But My wife lies dead
there on her deathbed!

658
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:18,321
It's one of her faces,

659
00:55:18,528 --> 00:55:20,587
as the princess is
one of death's faces.

660
00:55:20,664 --> 00:55:22,256
It's all false!

661
00:55:22,733 --> 00:55:25,293
Your wife is
in another world.

662
00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:27,633
I invite you
to follow Me there.

663
00:55:28,538 --> 00:55:31,564
I would follow her to hell!

664
00:55:32,342 --> 00:55:34,367
You needn't go that far.

665
00:55:39,516 --> 00:55:41,177
I want to fiind Eurydice.

666
00:55:41,652 --> 00:55:43,984
You don't need to beg.

667
00:55:44,454 --> 00:55:46,479
I'M offering it to you.

668
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:48,457
Look into My eyes.

669
00:55:48,959 --> 00:55:51,689
Is it Eurydice you wish to fiind,
or Death?

670
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:55,020
But...

671
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:58,090
I'M asking you very clearly:

672
00:55:58,869 --> 00:56:01,963
Is it Death you wish to fiind,
or Eurydice?

673
00:56:06,576 --> 00:56:08,043
Both.

674
00:56:09,479 --> 00:56:12,448
And, if you can, betray one
with the other?

675
00:56:12,983 --> 00:56:14,314
Let's hurry!

676
00:56:16,953 --> 00:56:20,081
I aM delighted
that I aM no longer alive.

677
00:56:22,693 --> 00:56:25,389
SoMeone left their gloves.

678
00:56:26,229 --> 00:56:28,561
- Gloves?
- Put theM on.

679
00:56:31,168 --> 00:56:32,999
CoMe on, put theM on.

680
00:56:47,217 --> 00:56:50,209
With these gloves you will pass
through Mirrors

681
00:56:50,287 --> 00:56:52,050
as if they were water.

682
00:56:52,889 --> 00:56:54,584
Prove it.

683
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:56,990
Try it.

684
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,857
I'll go with you.

685
00:56:59,696 --> 00:57:01,891
Look at the tiMe.

686
00:57:03,567 --> 00:57:05,558
Hands out in front.

687
00:57:15,846 --> 00:57:17,677
Perhaps you're afraid?

688
00:57:19,282 --> 00:57:21,944
But this Mirror
is a Mirror,

689
00:57:22,853 --> 00:57:25,617
and in it I see
an unhappy Man.

690
00:57:25,689 --> 00:57:28,590
You don't have to understand.

691
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:31,286
You just have to believe.

692
00:58:52,776 --> 00:58:54,744
Where are we?

693
00:58:54,945 --> 00:58:57,675
Life is a long death...

694
00:58:57,747 --> 00:58:59,271
This is no-Man's land.

695
00:58:59,516 --> 00:59:03,418
Here are Men's MeMories
and the ruins of their beliefs.

696
00:59:05,422 --> 00:59:08,721
Does every Mirror in the world
lead here?

697
00:59:09,226 --> 00:59:10,955
I suppose so.

698
00:59:11,294 --> 00:59:14,024
But I wouldn't want to be
in your gloves.

699
00:59:14,631 --> 00:59:18,123
Don't think I know Much More
than you do.

700
00:59:22,038 --> 00:59:24,939
CoMe on, keep Moving.

701
00:59:28,612 --> 00:59:30,603
It's hard to follow you.

702
00:59:31,615 --> 00:59:34,448
You Move,
but you're Motionless.

703
00:59:34,517 --> 00:59:36,951
It's different for Me.

704
00:59:42,259 --> 00:59:44,921
Glazier!

705
01:00:01,044 --> 01:00:04,275
Why are these people prowling
around? Are they alive?

706
01:00:05,081 --> 01:00:06,912
They think so.

707
01:00:06,983 --> 01:00:11,215
There's nothing More habit-forMing
than habit.

708
01:00:12,522 --> 01:00:14,513
Are we going far?

709
01:00:14,691 --> 01:00:18,684
The words you use
have no Meaning here.

710
01:00:19,629 --> 01:00:21,824
There's no wind.

711
01:00:21,898 --> 01:00:24,128
Why do you seeM to be
heading into the wind?

712
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,930
''Why?''
Always ''Why?''

713
01:00:27,003 --> 01:00:30,530
Ask no More questions.
Keep Moving.

714
01:00:36,613 --> 01:00:38,979
Do I have to take you
by the hand?

715
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:15,609
Did you receive orders
to transMit your Messages?

716
01:01:15,685 --> 01:01:16,845
Yes.

717
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,447
Did you receive orders to transMit
<i>certain</i> Messages?

718
01:01:20,623 --> 01:01:22,557
Didn't you have to subMit
the texts fiirst?

719
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:24,650
Be careful how you answer.

720
01:01:24,761 --> 01:01:27,787
No. I invented the phrases
and nuMbers.

721
01:01:27,864 --> 01:01:30,025
I Myself sent soMe phrases
I had written earlier.

722
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:33,069
Did you notice
anything peculiar

723
01:01:33,136 --> 01:01:34,330
about Heurtebise's behavior?

724
01:01:35,472 --> 01:01:38,305
I adMired how he could
coMe and go at will.

725
01:01:38,608 --> 01:01:40,235
I wished I could do that,

726
01:01:40,343 --> 01:01:42,436
but Death told Me
I'd never be able to.

727
01:01:42,512 --> 01:01:45,106
- That I was too cluMsy.
- Go on.

728
01:01:45,815 --> 01:01:48,113
Take the young Man away.

729
01:01:54,758 --> 01:01:57,022
Bring the other person in.

730
01:02:18,314 --> 01:02:19,941
May I sit down?

731
01:02:20,016 --> 01:02:21,643
Be seated.

732
01:02:22,986 --> 01:02:24,647
May I sMoke?

733
01:02:24,721 --> 01:02:26,689
If you wish.

734
01:02:32,128 --> 01:02:35,029
Having been given orders--

735
01:02:35,098 --> 01:02:37,191
or at least perMission--

736
01:02:37,267 --> 01:02:39,292
to take a young Man
into your service...

737
01:02:39,369 --> 01:02:41,929
you are accused of having taken
his wife as well.

738
01:02:42,605 --> 01:02:46,439
FurtherMore, of having undertaken
a private enterprise,

739
01:02:46,509 --> 01:02:49,842
and of having used
initiative.

740
01:02:50,113 --> 01:02:52,138
What do you have to say
in response?

741
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,110
Nothing.

742
01:02:54,751 --> 01:02:57,345
It was a series
of circuMstances.

743
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:59,911
There are no circuMstances
allowed here.

744
01:02:59,989 --> 01:03:01,513
There are only orders.

745
01:03:01,591 --> 01:03:03,286
Did you have orders?

746
01:03:04,027 --> 01:03:07,895
The laws of the other world
are so different froM ours.

747
01:03:09,232 --> 01:03:12,224
Perhaps I overstepped My authority
without realizing it.

748
01:03:21,211 --> 01:03:24,442
Before continuing the enquiry,

749
01:03:24,514 --> 01:03:26,778
we Must wait for another suspect
and a witness.

750
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:28,545
They're here.

751
01:03:37,927 --> 01:03:39,724
Hello.

752
01:03:40,597 --> 01:03:42,258
We're caught like rats.

753
01:03:42,732 --> 01:03:46,065
Make no Mistake, gentleMen.
These are <i>my</i> judges.

754
01:03:46,703 --> 01:03:48,261
Stay calM.

755
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:50,629
CoMe forward.

756
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:56,677
So, Heurtebise...

757
01:03:56,746 --> 01:03:59,237
now is the tiMe to say
what you have to say.

758
01:04:00,617 --> 01:04:02,278
I have nothing to say.

759
01:04:05,522 --> 01:04:08,286
You are accused of taking part
in an intrigue

760
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:11,690
in which Death was involved
without perMission.

761
01:04:12,195 --> 01:04:13,924
Do you have a good excuse?

762
01:04:13,997 --> 01:04:16,465
I was her aide.
I followed her.

763
01:04:16,533 --> 01:04:19,093
You lingered in the huMan world
for personal reasons,

764
01:04:19,169 --> 01:04:21,228
which you had no right to do.

765
01:04:22,338 --> 01:04:23,896
Perhaps.

766
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:25,773
There is no ''perhaps'' here.

767
01:04:25,842 --> 01:04:27,469
Answer.

768
01:04:27,577 --> 01:04:29,772
I didn't Mean to disobey.

769
01:04:30,313 --> 01:04:32,304
CoMe forward.

770
01:04:32,882 --> 01:04:35,476
You. You!

771
01:04:36,586 --> 01:04:38,144
- Me?
- Yes, you.

772
01:04:38,388 --> 01:04:39,878
Your naMe.

773
01:04:41,224 --> 01:04:43,715
- Your profession?
- Poet.

774
01:04:44,561 --> 01:04:47,325
The card says ''writer.''

775
01:04:47,397 --> 01:04:50,855
- It's alMost the saMe thing.
- There is no ''alMost'' here.

776
01:04:51,234 --> 01:04:53,668
What do you Mean by ''poet''?

777
01:04:54,204 --> 01:04:57,071
To write,
without being a writer.

778
01:05:01,945 --> 01:05:04,209
Do you know this Man?

779
01:05:05,014 --> 01:05:06,504
Yes.

780
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:09,211
Do you adMit
you took his wife?

781
01:05:10,587 --> 01:05:11,576
Yes.

782
01:05:11,654 --> 01:05:14,248
To get her out of the way
and have this Man for yourself?

783
01:05:14,324 --> 01:05:16,554
- GentleMen--
- Silence.

784
01:05:16,626 --> 01:05:19,720
CalM down.

785
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:24,261
- Keep calM.
- Do you love this Man?

786
01:05:30,773 --> 01:05:31,967
Yes.

787
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:35,704
Is it true you entered his rooM
to watch hiM sleep?

788
01:05:37,113 --> 01:05:38,102
Yes.

789
01:05:48,992 --> 01:05:51,051
Sign this paper.

790
01:05:55,765 --> 01:05:57,756
Do you have a pen?

791
01:06:00,603 --> 01:06:03,663
I forgot you're not a writer.

792
01:06:15,251 --> 01:06:18,152
Show these two people out.

793
01:06:23,893 --> 01:06:25,451
Not you.

794
01:06:26,062 --> 01:06:28,030
You stay.

795
01:06:37,707 --> 01:06:40,574
CoMe forward.

796
01:06:45,548 --> 01:06:48,108
Do you recognize
this Man?

797
01:06:49,385 --> 01:06:51,910
Of course. It's Heurtebise.

798
01:06:51,988 --> 01:06:54,718
Did he atteMpt to speak to you
in your husband's absence?

799
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:57,658
Did he say anything
shaMeful to you?

800
01:06:57,727 --> 01:06:59,695
ShaMeful?

801
01:06:59,762 --> 01:07:02,128
Of course not.
It's Heurtebise.

802
01:07:03,533 --> 01:07:06,502
Heurtebise, do you love
this woMan?

803
01:07:12,075 --> 01:07:15,374
I repeat:
Do you love this woMan?

804
01:07:16,579 --> 01:07:19,548
- Yes.
- That is all we wanted to know.

805
01:07:19,615 --> 01:07:21,549
Sign here.

806
01:07:34,797 --> 01:07:37,231
And you told theM yes?

807
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,666
One cannot lie here.

808
01:07:39,736 --> 01:07:42,068
My love.

809
01:07:42,138 --> 01:07:44,834
I loved you
even before we Met.

810
01:07:44,907 --> 01:07:47,000
I Must have seeMed
very stupid to you.

811
01:07:47,076 --> 01:07:49,510
What can we say
to each other?

812
01:07:50,279 --> 01:07:53,271
I don't have the right
to love anyone...

813
01:07:54,117 --> 01:07:56,711
and yet I love.

814
01:08:08,097 --> 01:08:10,463
You are all-powerful.

815
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:12,759
In your eyes.

816
01:08:13,536 --> 01:08:16,937
Here death takes on
innuMerable forMs.

817
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:20,337
Young and old,
they receive orders.

818
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:24,038
And if you disobeyed
those orders?

819
01:08:24,113 --> 01:08:26,707
They can't kill you.
It is you who kill.

820
01:08:27,483 --> 01:08:31,044
- What they do is worse.
- Where do the orders coMe froM?

821
01:08:33,456 --> 01:08:36,789
They are sent back and forth
by so Many sentinels

822
01:08:36,859 --> 01:08:39,657
like the toM-toMs
of your African tribes...

823
01:08:40,363 --> 01:08:42,923
the echoes
of your Mountains...

824
01:08:43,766 --> 01:08:45,825
the wind whispering
through your trees.

825
01:08:45,902 --> 01:08:48,564
I will go to he
who gives those orders.

826
01:08:48,638 --> 01:08:51,072
My poor love,
he exists nowhere.

827
01:08:53,409 --> 01:08:55,843
SoMe say he thinks
of us...

828
01:08:56,045 --> 01:08:58,343
others, that we are
his thoughts.

829
01:08:58,848 --> 01:09:01,783
Others say he sleeps
and that we are his dreaM...

830
01:09:03,152 --> 01:09:05,848
his bad dreaM.

831
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:11,256
I'll take you away froM here
when they set us free.

832
01:09:11,327 --> 01:09:12,988
Set us free?

833
01:09:13,062 --> 01:09:15,690
I never want to leave you.

834
01:09:16,032 --> 01:09:18,432
I Must leave you

835
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:22,028
but I swear I will fiind a way
to bring us back together.

836
01:09:22,405 --> 01:09:24,396
Say ''forever.''

837
01:09:25,241 --> 01:09:27,937
- Forever.
- Swear it.

838
01:09:29,412 --> 01:09:31,346
I swear.

839
01:09:31,414 --> 01:09:33,974
But now--

840
01:09:35,351 --> 01:09:38,684
- Now their police are here.
- A Miracle will happen.

841
01:09:38,754 --> 01:09:40,585
Miracles only happen
in your world.

842
01:09:40,656 --> 01:09:42,351
All worlds are Moved by lovers.

843
01:09:42,425 --> 01:09:46,088
In our world no one is Moved.
One goes froM judge to judge.

844
01:09:48,865 --> 01:09:50,457
CoMe.

845
01:09:55,104 --> 01:09:56,935
Go on. I love you.

846
01:09:57,006 --> 01:09:58,940
Do not be afraid.

847
01:09:59,008 --> 01:10:01,169
I don't want to lose you
again.

848
01:10:01,244 --> 01:10:03,109
If you resist,
you will lose <i>us</i>.

849
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:05,545
Follow Me.

850
01:10:23,165 --> 01:10:25,292
GentleMen.

851
01:10:30,606 --> 01:10:33,575
I shall now pronounce
the verdict.

852
01:10:35,011 --> 01:10:36,444
''We, this tribunal,

853
01:10:36,512 --> 01:10:41,279
release Orpheus' death
and her aides on bail.

854
01:10:42,418 --> 01:10:44,215
Orpheus is free

855
01:10:44,287 --> 01:10:46,847
on condition that he never speak
of what he has seen.

856
01:10:47,623 --> 01:10:49,614
Eurydice is free to return to life
in the other world

857
01:10:49,692 --> 01:10:51,956
on condition that Orpheus
never look upon her.

858
01:10:53,029 --> 01:10:55,497
A single glance at her
and he will lose her forever.''

859
01:10:55,565 --> 01:10:56,964
- But--
- Silence!

860
01:10:57,033 --> 01:10:58,933
Here is your wife.

861
01:10:59,001 --> 01:11:01,526
Be careful!
Don't look at her!

862
01:11:04,173 --> 01:11:06,004
You've Made a good start.

863
01:11:08,244 --> 01:11:11,338
May I be perMitted to accoMpany
Orpheus to his house?

864
01:11:12,114 --> 01:11:15,106
I'M afraid his coMpliance
May be diffiicult to Monitor

865
01:11:15,184 --> 01:11:17,379
without supervision
by one of our people.

866
01:11:17,453 --> 01:11:19,580
You May accoMpany
the couple.

867
01:11:19,655 --> 01:11:23,318
Under our watchful eye,
of course.

868
01:11:26,195 --> 01:11:27,719
- Do you have the gloves?
- No.

869
01:11:27,797 --> 01:11:30,493
- Oh, yes. In My pocket.
- Put theM on.

870
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:38,700
Close your eyes.
I will guide you.

871
01:11:38,774 --> 01:11:40,935
It will be easier that way
in the beginning.

872
01:11:43,779 --> 01:11:47,306
And... her?

873
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:49,911
May I look at her?

874
01:11:50,152 --> 01:11:52,120
Under no circuMstances.

875
01:11:52,188 --> 01:11:54,622
You Must not open your eyes
under any circuMstances!

876
01:11:55,324 --> 01:11:57,758
Take hold of hiM by the shoulders.
It will be safer that way.

877
01:11:57,827 --> 01:11:59,818
CoMe.

878
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:11,866
Where are the judges?

879
01:12:13,643 --> 01:12:15,508
The swine!

880
01:12:17,413 --> 01:12:18,937
Cegeste...

881
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:23,380
If I were of our forMer world,

882
01:12:24,186 --> 01:12:26,450
I'd say

883
01:12:27,023 --> 01:12:28,718
let's have a drink.

884
01:12:49,812 --> 01:12:52,007
How could it be 6:00?

885
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:53,514
We entered the Mirror
at 6:00.

886
01:12:53,582 --> 01:12:56,278
You Must not speak of these things.
You gave your word.

887
01:12:56,352 --> 01:12:58,217
There's a letter.

888
01:12:58,287 --> 01:12:59,948
I'll go.

889
01:13:00,022 --> 01:13:02,013
Call out froM the garden,
''I'M coMing back in...''

890
01:13:02,091 --> 01:13:03,615
and Eurydice will hide.

891
01:13:03,693 --> 01:13:06,321
- How convenient.
- What a nightMare!

892
01:13:24,914 --> 01:13:26,677
Be careful!

893
01:13:27,149 --> 01:13:29,447
Why shouldn't I look at Myself?

894
01:13:29,518 --> 01:13:32,487
If Orpheus coMes in,
he Might see you in the Mirror.

895
01:13:32,755 --> 01:13:35,087
It's a good thing you caMe.

896
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:41,195
You're not angry with Me
for what I said at the tribunal?

897
01:13:41,530 --> 01:13:43,760
What did you say?

898
01:13:46,602 --> 01:13:48,536
Excuse Me.

899
01:13:49,739 --> 01:13:53,106
When Orpheus coMes in,
hide under the table.

900
01:13:55,945 --> 01:13:57,913
An anonyMous letter,
written backwards.

901
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:00,505
Look out, Eurydice!
He's coMing!

902
01:14:06,188 --> 01:14:07,951
Be careful, Orpheus.

903
01:14:08,324 --> 01:14:11,589
- Eurydice, are you under the table?
- I aM.

904
01:14:12,394 --> 01:14:14,021
Where is he?

905
01:14:14,096 --> 01:14:16,496
- Where are you?
- Over there, under the table.

906
01:14:16,899 --> 01:14:18,594
That's great.

907
01:14:19,301 --> 01:14:23,795
''You Are A Thief And A Murderer.
We Will Meet On Your Grave.''

908
01:14:23,873 --> 01:14:26,171
Beware of Mirrors.

909
01:14:27,343 --> 01:14:30,972
- No need to tell Me.
- I Meant her reflection.

910
01:14:31,046 --> 01:14:33,742
Heurtebise forbids Me
to look at Myself in the Mirror.

911
01:14:33,816 --> 01:14:36,546
Get rid of that stupid letter!

912
01:14:36,752 --> 01:14:38,413
May I coMe out?

913
01:14:39,555 --> 01:14:41,546
Just a Minute.
Turn your back.

914
01:14:41,624 --> 01:14:43,114
You can coMe out.

915
01:14:43,192 --> 01:14:45,217
I can't even say
how diffiicult this is...

916
01:14:45,294 --> 01:14:48,786
the tension such an absurd thing
causes!

917
01:14:48,864 --> 01:14:50,855
It'll becoMe a habit.

918
01:14:50,933 --> 01:14:52,924
A strange habit!

919
01:14:53,002 --> 01:14:55,402
It's better than being blind...

920
01:14:55,471 --> 01:14:56,961
or losing a leg.

921
01:14:57,039 --> 01:14:59,132
We don't have Much choice.

922
01:14:59,441 --> 01:15:01,272
It even has its advantages.

923
01:15:01,343 --> 01:15:03,208
Orpheus won't see
My wrinkles.

924
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:05,679
Fine!

925
01:15:05,748 --> 01:15:08,080
It seeMs you think
it's all a joke.

926
01:15:08,150 --> 01:15:09,913
I don't see what else
your wife could do.

927
01:15:09,985 --> 01:15:12,010
- What else she could--
- Careful!

928
01:15:12,087 --> 01:15:14,214
You're dangerous, My friend.

929
01:15:14,857 --> 01:15:17,451
I'M not going to live
with blinders on!

930
01:15:17,526 --> 01:15:19,858
I'll get you a drink.
Close your eyes.

931
01:15:19,929 --> 01:15:22,830
Heurtebise will sit you down
while I'M in the kitchen.

932
01:15:23,632 --> 01:15:26,396
I'll tell you what else
My wife could do:

933
01:15:26,468 --> 01:15:29,335
She could realize
the awful position I'M in.

934
01:15:29,405 --> 01:15:31,566
You think she doesn't suffer too?

935
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:34,040
You're wrong.
WoMen adore coMplications.

936
01:15:34,109 --> 01:15:36,270
Close your eyes.

937
01:15:37,313 --> 01:15:41,272
- What if I put on a blindfold?
- That would be cheating.

938
01:15:41,483 --> 01:15:44,316
It's wiser to get used to it
right froM the start.

939
01:15:44,386 --> 01:15:47,514
It won't be easy, I know,
but we'll Make it.

940
01:15:47,756 --> 01:15:50,623
Bring a chair.
Sit down.

941
01:15:50,693 --> 01:15:52,661
I'll turn My back.

942
01:15:55,831 --> 01:15:57,856
It's when you're Moving around
that you're dangerous.

943
01:16:00,069 --> 01:16:02,902
A picture of your wife
is not your wife.

944
01:16:03,873 --> 01:16:05,431
I'M so tired.

945
01:16:05,507 --> 01:16:07,907
A decision has to be Made
about how to handle this situation,

946
01:16:07,977 --> 01:16:09,444
and it's up to Me
to Make it.

947
01:16:09,511 --> 01:16:12,241
We can't spend our lives
playing hide-and-seek.

948
01:16:12,381 --> 01:16:14,349
Do you want Me to go live
soMewhere else?

949
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:17,112
- Always exaggerating!
- CoMe on, Orpheus.

950
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:20,418
We can't share
the saMe rooM.

951
01:16:20,489 --> 01:16:23,322
I'll sleep here on the sofa.

952
01:16:23,659 --> 01:16:25,684
Now who's exaggerating?

953
01:16:25,761 --> 01:16:27,092
Be careful!

954
01:16:27,162 --> 01:16:30,290
It's her fault! She could provoke
even a corpse to turn around!

955
01:16:30,633 --> 01:16:33,830
- I should have stayed dead.
- Tell her to be quiet!

956
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:37,703
I'M incredibly on edge.
I could do anything!

957
01:16:38,807 --> 01:16:41,071
You've Made your wife cry.

958
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:43,737
Since I annoy everyone,
I'll leave!

959
01:16:43,812 --> 01:16:46,747
- Where are you going?
- To <i>my</i> rooM.

960
01:16:55,557 --> 01:16:57,320
Try to calM down.

961
01:16:57,393 --> 01:16:59,793
He hates Me.

962
01:17:00,262 --> 01:17:03,322
If he hated you, he would not have
snared you froM death.

963
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:07,101
For that he will always
be reMeMbered.

964
01:17:07,169 --> 01:17:09,433
He didn't coMe for Me.

965
01:17:11,707 --> 01:17:13,538
You know that.

966
01:17:14,043 --> 01:17:16,238
Just like you know
where he's going

967
01:17:16,312 --> 01:17:18,746
when he goes to the car.

968
01:17:57,786 --> 01:18:01,347
<i>Orpheus was lost to Eurydice.</i>

969
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:04,491
S<i>he could not bear</i>
<i>to live this way.</i>

970
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,858
S<i>he wanted to save him</i>
<i>from herself.</i>..

971
01:18:06,929 --> 01:18:09,830
<i>and there was only one way</i>
<i>to do it.</i>

972
01:18:15,204 --> 01:18:17,434
Do you love this Man?

973
01:18:20,242 --> 01:18:23,040
I'M asking you
if you love this Man.

974
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:26,771
What is it?
Is that you?

975
01:18:28,517 --> 01:18:31,452
It's Me, Eurydice.

976
01:18:32,021 --> 01:18:35,081
I know you often fall asleep
with the laMp on,

977
01:18:35,157 --> 01:18:38,593
but since the electricity has been
cut off for an hour,

978
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:41,686
I caMe down
to fiind a book.

979
01:18:41,764 --> 01:18:44,631
A book?
To read in the dark?

980
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,565
Try to understand.

981
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:50,971
Think of the risk you're exposing us to
with your foolishness.

982
01:18:51,173 --> 01:18:54,233
Go upstairs
and close the trapdoor.

983
01:18:55,644 --> 01:18:58,238
You gave Me a bad scare.

984
01:18:59,348 --> 01:19:01,942
- Do you forgive Me?
- Of course.

985
01:19:02,317 --> 01:19:05,252
Go upstairs
and get soMe sleep.

986
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:12,957
<i>A short black-out</i>

987
01:19:13,028 --> 01:19:15,496
<i>had made her miss her chance.</i>

988
01:19:15,597 --> 01:19:18,395
S<i>he had to go on living,</i>

989
01:19:18,467 --> 01:19:20,867
<i>and the ne</i>x<i>t day--</i>

990
01:19:33,816 --> 01:19:36,683
You've coMe just in tiMe.
Do you understand the code?

991
01:19:38,587 --> 01:19:40,646
Stock Market quotations.

992
01:19:40,722 --> 01:19:43,418
- What about this?
- Be careful, your wife is coMing.

993
01:19:43,492 --> 01:19:45,517
Don't push her too far.

994
01:19:45,961 --> 01:19:48,828
- May I coMe in?
- Close your eyes for a Minute.

995
01:19:49,832 --> 01:19:52,164
Yes, coMe in.

996
01:19:57,973 --> 01:20:00,533
Your husband was listening
to the stock Market.

997
01:20:00,609 --> 01:20:03,578
- Get in the back.
- AM I bothering you?

998
01:20:03,712 --> 01:20:07,307
I was listening out here
so I wouldn't disturb you in the house.

999
01:20:08,417 --> 01:20:11,352
- That noise frightens Me.
- Don't take risks.

1000
01:20:11,487 --> 01:20:13,546
What risks?

1001
01:20:13,622 --> 01:20:16,455
Orpheus can't see Me,
but I can touch his cheek.

1002
01:20:18,861 --> 01:20:20,624
It's wonderful!

1003
01:20:21,830 --> 01:20:23,593
The Mirror!

1004
01:20:25,567 --> 01:20:27,626
That was bound to happen.

1005
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:36,234
It had to happen.

1006
01:20:39,615 --> 01:20:41,776
It had to happen, Heurtebise.

1007
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:44,614
I had enough of half-Measures
and arrangeMents.

1008
01:20:44,686 --> 01:20:47,587
There's no getting adjusted to that.
You have to go all the way.

1009
01:20:49,691 --> 01:20:51,522
Stones. You can Make
a statue of Me with theM!

1010
01:20:51,593 --> 01:20:53,254
You Mustn't stay outdoors.

1011
01:20:54,396 --> 01:20:57,593
There they are, the swine!
I've been expecting theM.

1012
01:20:57,666 --> 01:20:59,725
The letter, Heurtebise.
The anonyMous letter.

1013
01:20:59,801 --> 01:21:00,961
I'll talk to theM.

1014
01:21:01,036 --> 01:21:03,732
What does Marble think
when it's being sculpted?

1015
01:21:03,805 --> 01:21:06,899
It thinks, ''I aM struck,
insulted, ruined, lost.''

1016
01:21:07,442 --> 01:21:10,468
Life is sculpting Me.
Let it fiinish its work.

1017
01:21:23,792 --> 01:21:25,987
- The swine!
- Threaten theM with this.

1018
01:21:26,061 --> 01:21:27,722
This is your house!

1019
01:21:53,722 --> 01:21:57,317
Give Me that revolver.
I'M ordering you to give it to Me.

1020
01:21:59,561 --> 01:22:01,119
And I order you
to get off My property.

1021
01:22:01,196 --> 01:22:02,891
I forbid you to coMe back
on My property.

1022
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:06,423
- I'll enter your property when I like.
- Do you want to kill Me?

1023
01:22:06,501 --> 01:22:08,696
We want to know
where Jacques Cegeste is.

1024
01:22:09,905 --> 01:22:12,169
- Is he here with you?
- Stay back or I'll shoot.

1025
01:22:12,674 --> 01:22:14,232
I'll shoot!

1026
01:22:58,186 --> 01:23:00,051
- Step away froM the door.
- Keep calM.

1027
01:23:00,122 --> 01:23:02,420
He's only wounded.
No one will harM you.

1028
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:34,081
Is it done?

1029
01:23:35,557 --> 01:23:37,616
It is done.

1030
01:24:45,894 --> 01:24:49,022
- Cegeste.
- MadaM?

1031
01:24:49,097 --> 01:24:52,362
This is the fiirst tiMe I have alMost
understood the notion of tiMe.

1032
01:24:53,001 --> 01:24:55,902
Waiting Must be frightful
for Men.

1033
01:24:55,971 --> 01:24:58,269
I no longer reMeMber.

1034
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:03,238
- Are you bored?
- What's that?

1035
01:25:04,212 --> 01:25:06,009
Forgive Me.

1036
01:25:06,481 --> 01:25:08,574
I was talking to Myself.

1037
01:25:24,866 --> 01:25:27,130
<i>lt's not the same</i> j<i>ourney</i>
<i>this time.</i>

1038
01:25:27,202 --> 01:25:29,693
<i>Heurtebise leads Orpheus</i>

1039
01:25:29,771 --> 01:25:32,467
<i>where he should not lead him.</i>

1040
01:25:32,974 --> 01:25:36,068
<i>No longer the wonderful</i>
<i>motionless</i> j<i>ourney,</i>

1041
01:25:36,478 --> 01:25:39,936
<i>Orpheus and his guide</i>
<i>trudge on,</i>

1042
01:25:40,148 --> 01:25:43,379
<i>at every turn forced back</i>
<i>and forced on</i>

1043
01:25:43,652 --> 01:25:46,917
<i>by a great</i>
<i>and ine</i>x<i>plicable breath.</i>

1044
01:26:19,855 --> 01:26:21,846
They are here.

1045
01:26:30,499 --> 01:26:32,694
I found a way to coMe
to you again.

1046
01:26:32,767 --> 01:26:34,928
I called out froM within Me
for so long that you fiinally caMe.

1047
01:26:35,003 --> 01:26:38,268
I heard you
and waited for you.

1048
01:26:38,974 --> 01:26:40,965
I did not want you to stay
among men.

1049
01:26:42,911 --> 01:26:46,540
- Where shall we hide?
- We no longer have to hide.

1050
01:26:47,816 --> 01:26:51,149
- We are free.
- Forever?

1051
01:26:53,855 --> 01:26:55,288
Forever.

1052
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:58,024
Hold Me, Orpheus.
Hold Me tight.

1053
01:26:59,828 --> 01:27:03,229
You burn like ice.

1054
01:27:03,732 --> 01:27:06,360
You still have
a huMan warMth.

1055
01:27:06,535 --> 01:27:09,163
- It's nice.
- I love you.

1056
01:27:10,105 --> 01:27:12,471
I love you.

1057
01:27:13,241 --> 01:27:15,402
- Will you obey Me?
- I will obey you.

1058
01:27:15,477 --> 01:27:17,206
- Whatever I ask?
- Whatever you ask.

1059
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:19,941
Even if I passed sentence on you?
If I tortured you?

1060
01:27:20,615 --> 01:27:22,173
I belong to you

1061
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,774
and I will never leave you.

1062
01:27:23,852 --> 01:27:25,752
Never again.

1063
01:27:28,757 --> 01:27:31,783
- You know what I expect of you.
- But MadaM--

1064
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:34,886
It's our last hope,
and we don't have a second to lose.

1065
01:27:34,963 --> 01:27:37,727
- Reconsider--
- There is no need to reconsider.

1066
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:41,360
There is nothing worse
in <i>any</i> world.

1067
01:27:41,469 --> 01:27:42,902
Are you a coward?

1068
01:27:42,971 --> 01:27:44,996
<i>The death of a poet</i>

1069
01:27:45,073 --> 01:27:46,870
<i>requires a sacrifice</i>

1070
01:27:46,942 --> 01:27:49,342
<i>to render him immortal.</i>

1071
01:27:50,512 --> 01:27:52,707
For the last tiMe,
I beg you...

1072
01:27:52,781 --> 01:27:55,341
do not try to understand
what I aM going to do,

1073
01:27:56,418 --> 01:28:00,878
for in truth it would be diffiicult
to understand even in our world.

1074
01:28:03,792 --> 01:28:05,726
- Stand here.
- Quick.

1075
01:28:05,794 --> 01:28:07,557
Cegeste, to work!

1076
01:28:08,430 --> 01:28:11,399
Orpheus, don't Move.
Stay still. You proMised.

1077
01:28:12,133 --> 01:28:13,828
Work, work!

1078
01:28:14,269 --> 01:28:17,295
Heurtebise, I'll help you.
I'll work along with you.

1079
01:28:17,672 --> 01:28:20,163
Don't weaken.

1080
01:28:20,241 --> 01:28:23,210
Count... calculate.
Labor as I labor.

1081
01:28:23,278 --> 01:28:26,338
Seal hiM off. You Must!

1082
01:28:26,615 --> 01:28:29,175
Without willpower
we are cripples.

1083
01:28:30,485 --> 01:28:32,578
I can do no More.

1084
01:28:32,687 --> 01:28:36,179
You Must will it, Heurtebise.
You Must!

1085
01:28:37,192 --> 01:28:39,251
- I can't.
- You're not trying.

1086
01:28:39,327 --> 01:28:43,229
Don't speak.
Go deep inside yourself

1087
01:28:43,298 --> 01:28:47,257
and escape froM yourself. Run!
Overturn all obstacles!

1088
01:28:47,769 --> 01:28:49,794
You're nearly there.

1089
01:28:50,605 --> 01:28:52,766
You're there.

1090
01:28:53,475 --> 01:28:55,500
I see it.

1091
01:28:56,845 --> 01:28:58,437
I'M alMost there.

1092
01:28:58,513 --> 01:29:01,414
A fiinal effort, Heurtebise.

1093
01:29:01,483 --> 01:29:04,179
Do it.

1094
01:29:06,354 --> 01:29:08,254
Are you there?

1095
01:29:08,890 --> 01:29:10,915
Answer Me.
Are you there?

1096
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:14,057
I'M there.

1097
01:29:15,897 --> 01:29:18,092
Then set out.

1098
01:29:18,933 --> 01:29:20,833
Go back in tiMe.

1099
01:29:20,902 --> 01:29:23,837
What has been
Must no longer be.

1100
01:30:13,922 --> 01:30:17,653
- I'M very tired.
- I don't care!

1101
01:30:18,093 --> 01:30:21,494
Work.
Work, I coMMand you!

1102
01:31:24,058 --> 01:31:25,992
Where are you?

1103
01:31:26,461 --> 01:31:28,656
In the rooM.

1104
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:30,527
The gloves.

1105
01:31:30,598 --> 01:31:32,088
Get the gloves, quick!

1106
01:31:58,693 --> 01:32:00,820
Were you watching Me sleep?

1107
01:32:02,430 --> 01:32:04,364
Yes, My love.

1108
01:32:05,366 --> 01:32:08,733
- I had a terrible nightMare.
- You don't feel ill?

1109
01:32:09,103 --> 01:32:12,698
- No. A little headache.
- I will cure you.

1110
01:32:14,042 --> 01:32:16,772
- Were you working?
- I was working.

1111
01:32:16,845 --> 01:32:19,507
You work too hard.
Try to rest.

1112
01:32:19,581 --> 01:32:22,311
My books don't write
theMselves.

1113
01:32:22,383 --> 01:32:24,943
- But they do!
- I help theM.

1114
01:32:25,019 --> 01:32:26,486
How is the young boy
behaving?

1115
01:32:27,989 --> 01:32:30,321
- It Might be a girl.
- It's a boy!

1116
01:32:30,391 --> 01:32:32,791
He's kicking Me.

1117
01:32:34,028 --> 01:32:38,556
- He'll be as unbearable as his father.
- Unbearable? You?

1118
01:32:39,033 --> 01:32:41,627
Many people fiind Me
unbearable.

1119
01:32:41,836 --> 01:32:43,895
Poor you! They love you.

1120
01:32:44,105 --> 01:32:47,404
- They loathe Me.
- That's a forM of love.

1121
01:32:48,543 --> 01:32:51,910
There's only one love
that counts:

1122
01:32:52,447 --> 01:32:54,142
ours.

1123
01:33:08,563 --> 01:33:10,053
Is it done?

1124
01:33:10,531 --> 01:33:12,158
It is done.

1125
01:33:13,701 --> 01:33:16,898
MadaM, your own aides.

1126
01:33:16,971 --> 01:33:18,632
They're here to arrest you.

1127
01:33:18,706 --> 01:33:20,105
Yes, Cegeste.

1128
01:33:20,174 --> 01:33:21,937
Flee!

1129
01:33:22,076 --> 01:33:23,771
Where?

1130
01:33:25,013 --> 01:33:26,674
When they arrest you here...

1131
01:33:26,748 --> 01:33:28,215
what happens?

1132
01:33:28,950 --> 01:33:31,145
It's not pleasant.

1133
01:33:31,352 --> 01:33:33,252
It's never pleasant.

1134
01:33:35,290 --> 01:33:38,350
Here less than anywhere else.

1135
01:33:51,039 --> 01:33:52,973
Thank you.

1136
01:33:53,508 --> 01:33:55,339
It was nothing.

1137
01:33:56,477 --> 01:33:59,878
We had to return theM
to their swaMp.

1138
01:34:05,153 --> 01:34:07,383
Farewell, Cegeste.

1139
01:34:54,268 --> 01:34:58,830
THE END
