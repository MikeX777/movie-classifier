What these people
wanted was time.

14
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:58,629
Those of you out there,

15
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,968
I'd like for you to think about
the amount of spare time

16
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,705
you have in your lives.

17
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:08,542
I'll see you again next week.
Good-bye.

18
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:16,510
Good work everyone.

19
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,458
You did great today.

20
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:20,823
Good work everyone.

21
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,485
So what's the topic
for next week?

22
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,723
We have on ready,
but it's a bit complicated.

23
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:26,961
How about dinner?

24
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,899
I already have an appointment,
so maybe next time.

25
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,379
I talked to the station chief,
and he seemed interested.

26
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,881
Really?

27
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,120
I hope I'm not being
too much of a burden.

28
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,547
Not at all.

29
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,724
If things work out,
it could turn out well.

30
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,694
But I want to
finish it on my own.

31
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,794
You should've bought the CD.

32
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:09,034
It's obsolete,
and I barely got a copy of it.

33
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,176
I think I'm pregnant.

34
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,188
Are you sure?

35
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,962
Was it on that day
that worried you?

36
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,469
Soo-jin,
how about you get some rest?

37
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:47,410
Resting won't matter.

38
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,321
I'll take care of it on my own.

39
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,791
Sir, here's what you asked for.

40
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,801
Right, thanks.

41
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,438
When did you get here?

42
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,767
Why couldn't I
reach you last night?

43
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,472
I called so many times
about today's shoot.

44
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,707
Sorry.

45
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:26,377
I was out drinking all night
with my friends.

46
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,014
What's that on the screen?

47
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,417
Is it a suicide site?

48
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,392
Oh, this?

49
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,021
It's nothing special.

50
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:45,736
You transferred from violent
crimes to cyber-investigation.

51
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,498
Are you more satisfied now?

52
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:54,403
Well, no matter what department,
I'm always catching criminals,

53
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,974
So I think
nothing differently of it.

54
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,942
What's the case about?

55
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:01,948
Which case?

56
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,551
The one you were looking at.

57
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,021
I better go.

58
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,192
- Officer Ju, I'll be back.
- Okay.

59
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:15,794
- Going somewhere?
- Pardon?

60
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:19,796
Remember, we agreed for me
to follow you all day today.

61
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,985
Seems as if the uterus expanded
and pressured the bowels.

62
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:44,061
See here how the pelvis widened,
and smashed into the bowels?

63
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,960
But the belly doesn't
swell down this easily.

64
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,365
I think it's very strange.

65
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:56,165
But she was definitely
ready to give birth.

66
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,006
So are there any signs
that she did?

67
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,636
I can't be sure of it right now.

68
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,439
But I plan to conduct another
thorough examination today.

69
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,309
Do you feel better?

70
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,055
What a strange case.

71
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:17,293
The site I'm investigating
has a very strange homepage.

72
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,691
Think it has anything to do
with her death?

73
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,630
Well, I'm not exactly sure.

74
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,503
But I think it's
related to her death.

75
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,767
Do you have any suspects?

76
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,237
I'll have to investigate further.

77
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,214
She wasn't pregnant.

78
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,988
We lived together
until two weeks ago.

79
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,491
And there was nothing strange
about her body.

80
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,220
We went to the
public bath together.

81
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,598
So when did she move in
to that apartment?

82
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,771
About two weeks ago.

83
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,301
There must be some reason
why she moved there.

84
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:08,379
Was there anything you
heard or found strange?

85
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:17,186
After she looked at
something on the computer,

86
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:22,017
she turned as white as a ghost.

87
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,463
She said she was going to die.
I asked her why.

88
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,865
And she said
she saw herself dying.

89
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,868
What are you doing?

90
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,338
This place is great!
You can't tell who's who!

91
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,836
What's going on?

92
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,882
Somebody call an ambulance!

93
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,748
She's one of the girls
who said she saw herself die.

94
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,657
What's wrong with it?

95
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,970
This is the end.

96
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,070
I swear I saw her stomach
swollen up at the scene.

97
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,644
But it strangely turned fuzzy
on the screen.

98
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,509
Really?

99
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,910
Her autopsy results
fit with the other death.

100
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,581
Medical responses are clean.

101
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:06,186
But there are no clear signs
of external wounds.

102
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,054
That's strange.

103
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,686
Why are these
serial murders occurring?

104
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,593
Oh yeah, the air time
will be scheduled soon.

105
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,068
Is that so?

106
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,201
Wow, it makes me nervous
thinking this will be on TV.

107
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,308
Just a sec.

108
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:26,873
Hello?

109
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,639
Good.

110
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:37,918
When it's done,
we'll put it on Ei-suk's show.

111
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,682
On "Looking at the World"?

112
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,385
Why?
Don't like popular shows?

113
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,290
No, sir.

114
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,795
What's the title?

115
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,966
There's nothing definite yet.

116
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:53,535
But I'm thinking about
calling it "Cybercop, 25 hours".

117
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,843
Sounds good to me.
Let's go with that.

118
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,773
- Is there anything you need?
- No, sir.

119
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,371
Make it real fun.

120
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,851
Thank you, sir.

121
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:13,650
Aren't you scared
that a person died there?

122
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,360
Will it be as bad as the club?

123
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,954
Anyway,
it's all part of the job.

124
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,627
Won't have anything to shoot
since it's cleaned up.

125
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,093
But you never know.

126
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:30,671
Wow, making a documentary
sure isn't easy.

127
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,300
Soo-jin.
I have to go ask something,

128
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,930
so please wait here.

129
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:40,463
So many people
moved in and out of that place.

130
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,902
They said they heard
strange noises at night.

131
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,470
Now that someone died there,

132
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,276
who'd want to move in there?

133
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,083
Gynecology Clinic

134
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,966
Mari Women's Clinic

135
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,841
When was it open?

136
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,770
Lm Su-young's Women's Clinic?

137
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,477
But this address
is for Mari Women's Clinic.

138
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:43,595
Know where that
record I mentioned is?

139
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,129
Oh that.

140
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,893
It'll be hard to find here.

141
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:57,734
I'm sorry.

142
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,038
This album was hard to find.

143
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,409
I hope it can be
of some comfort.

144
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:16,615
Han Soo-jin
Seoul, Shindang District, 35-1

145
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,279
Han Soo-jin

146
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,326
Hello?

147
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,190
It's me, Choi Jin-suk.

148
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,895
Is something wrong?

149
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,533
It's nothing.
So why did you call?

150
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:25,572
You've clicked on that site,
haven't you?

151
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,042
Pardon?

152
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,678
We need to meet and talk.

153
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,323
Until now, all the victims
have clicked on this site.

154
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:52,900
You're saying that anyone
who clicks on it dies?

155
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:01,435
That's it.
After I clicked on it...

156
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,240
Don't!

157
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,682
If I click here,
the main site pops up.

158
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:10,982
Shall I not?

159
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,295
I swear it was there before.

160
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,363
If what I saw was real...

161
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,309
What was in there?

162
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:40,942
It was like a very
bright white room.

163
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,555
This picture...

164
00:23:56,668 --> 00:24:00,536
It looks like the portrait
in that apartment.

165
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,969
Detective Choi,
what brings you here?

166
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,334
How have you been?

167
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,473
I came to see
the server operator.

168
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:18,815
Has there been another ICD
problem with that closed site?

169
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:21,015
Not that I know of.

170
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,143
I guess
someone else is using it.

171
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:25,151
- Really?
- Maybe so.

172
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,018
I'll see you later.

173
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:43,430
It's strange.
I swear I erased it earlier.

174
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:47,739
Now it's been erased.

175
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,478
Look at that!

176
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,014
What's happening?

177
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,233
Is something bothering you?

178
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,336
Nothing really.

179
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:29,202
I think the captain is
trying to tell me something.

180
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:30,773
Tell you what?

181
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,849
You know,
that ghost site case.

182
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,985
It's been handed over
to violent crimes.

183
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:38,453
He's probably implying
that I take my hands off.

184
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:43,723
How long have you
been on the force?

185
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:45,989
Pardon?

186
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:49,332
Think a detective
chases the criminal?

187
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,534
This may sound strange.

188
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:59,404
I've always been
chasing criminals until now,

189
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:04,111
but this case feels like
it's drawing me in this time.

190
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:10,114
Don't worry.
I'll handle it on my own.

191
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,861
Jung Ei-suk speaking.
Yes, sir.

192
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,495
Yes, I understand.

193
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,202
I'll come right up.

194
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,516
Until the rumors settle down,
the two of you be careful.

195
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:43,347
Since I don't want
to see Soo-jin get fired.

196
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,757
I'll solve it on my own, sir.

197
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,659
Soo-jin.

198
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,486
Know why you were
reprimanded before?

199
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:45,605
How long do we have to hide
from everybody?

200
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,450
The news anchor position
will be mine soon.

201
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,779
Just wait a little longer.

202
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:58,622
But...
Wouldn't it better to

203
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,122
bring it out in the open now?

204
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,425
Be a little more patient.

205
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,601
You can do that, right?

206
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,408
Was it your idea that

207
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,840
I get taken off your show?

208
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,681
The reason why
you couldn't get on it

209
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,616
was because people
would talk behind your back.

210
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,813
I'd never request such a thing.

211
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,726
Because I love you.

212
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,361
You trust me, right?

213
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,640
Say something.

214
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:50,705
Yes.
I trust you.

215
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:45,795
She said she was going to die.
I asked her why.

216
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,531
And she said
she saw herself dying.

217
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,086
That Mrs. Oh Young-ae
who lives upstairs

218
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,927
has clicked on that site before.

219
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,198
But strangely enough,

220
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:22,067
I heard she wanted
to move in to room 1308.

221
00:32:22,473 --> 00:32:25,601
Most people would stay away
from a place someone died in,

222
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,638
but she's the opposite.

223
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,521
Who are you?

224
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:46,886
Hello.

225
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:55,700
I saw you once downstairs.
Do you remember me?

226
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,133
I came because I have
some things to ask you.

227
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,141
Come in.

228
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:14,787
You know about the
Mari Women's Clinic site, right?

229
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,354
People who clicked on it died.

230
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,261
So why are you here?

231
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,538
You clicked on it recently,
haven't you?

232
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,401
So you think maybe
I'm the one who made it, right?

233
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,872
Since I'm still alive?

234
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:37,944
It's not me.

235
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,808
I know you tried to
move in to room 1308.

236
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:47,224
The only reason why
was because it was vacant.

237
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:57,628
The power of a strong curse
is flowing all the way to here.

238
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,899
It's passing on to me.

239
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,049
Sounds like it's coming
from the pipes.

240
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,488
That would be a relief.

241
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:25,028
What were you looking for
by clicking on to that site?

242
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,996
After I logged on,
I felt something strange.

243
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:34,000
A feeling mixed
with hatred and sadness.

244
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:37,136
Felt like it was
trying to say something.

245
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,041
One thing is certain.

246
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,877
The hatred gradually
became stronger.

247
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:53,355
That portrait.
It's the site's background.

248
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,813
It all happened 15 days later.

249
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:24,653
17th, Han Soo-jin
31 st

250
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,693
Did you meet Oh Young-ae?

251
00:35:31,729 --> 00:35:34,163
She tried to say something,

252
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,660
but I'm not sure what it was.

253
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,508
Soo-jin.

254
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:47,743
Yes.

255
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:55,878
All the victims died 15 days
after they clicked on the site.

256
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:09,662
It's now been a week
since you logged on.

257
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:15,902
So a week later, I...

258
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,275
Stay strong, Soo-jin.

259
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:34,624
I'm going to move
in to that apartment.

260
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:49,068
She kept insisting on
moving in to room 1308.

261
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,182
You don't see anything, right?

262
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:10,122
Doctor,
please check once more.

263
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:13,192
I'm sure something is in there.

264
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,989
If people are
oversensitive or stressed,

265
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:19,865
they tend to be confused.

266
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:26,271
I'm sorry,
but can I try it?

267
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:44,420
Doctor.
It's there.

268
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:46,186
It's there, doctor!

269
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:53,996
I just saw it.

270
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:56,469
I even heard
it's heart beating.

271
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,535
It's probably
because you're tired.

272
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:02,004
Eat well and rest for a while.

273
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:04,774
I'm telling you I saw it
with my own eyes!

274
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:08,442
Please calm down.
It's okay.

275
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,970
Are you crazy?

276
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,889
How about going home now?

277
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,292
I didn't come here

278
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,130
on my own will.

279
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:38,263
I feel like something
drew me here.

280
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,337
Aren't you scared?

281
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,246
I can handle it.

282
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:46,980
If there's a way to live.

283
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,854
What should I do now?

284
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,062
Just rest.

285
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:01,347
Is somebody there?

286
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:07,721
Is somebody there?

287
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:44,866
- Who are you?
- Please put that away.

288
00:46:45,002 --> 00:46:46,401
Are you a tenant?

289
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:49,194
Yes.

290
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,777
Aren't you scared
to be here as a woman?

291
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,875
I thought I heard something.

292
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,881
Well, I didn't hear anything.

293
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:13,453
Looks like room 1308's tenant
hasn't picked up her stuff yet.

294
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:28,034
Sunyoung Art Instiute

295
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,848
I'm sure it's
Yoo-shil's self-portrait.

296
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:34,743
Is there any way to find her?

297
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:42,425
Yoo-shil was a very gifted girl.

298
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:46,960
Winning a prize at the teen art
competition is an amazing feat.

299
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:50,999
Being an orphan
and a bit autistic,

300
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:54,003
all she was
interested in was art.

301
00:47:54,137 --> 00:47:56,298
Where is she now?

302
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,976
It's been a long time
since we've spoken.

303
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:04,537
So then...

304
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:09,483
Yoo-shil's friend
was my daughter, In-mee.

305
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,747
They were very close.

306
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:18,017
She might know
what happened to Yoo-shil.

307
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:24,559
Miss Ahn In-mee?

308
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,801
You're Yoo-shil's friend, right?

309
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,131
- I have some questions.
- I don't know anything.

310
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,435
I need to know
what happened to Yoo-shil.

311
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,839
What for?

312
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:38,941
My life is in danger.

313
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:54,086
If Yoo-shil falls for something,

314
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:57,590
then she can't separate from it.

315
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:02,896
She'd stay up
for several days painting.

316
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:09,545
She gets really attached
to something she likes.

317
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:17,382
But when she started dating,

318
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:20,615
she often postponed her work.

319
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,817
Who was the guy?

320
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,285
She didn't tell me.

321
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:33,094
She painted this picture
to give to him.

322
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:38,803
She was so crazy about him.

323
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:45,041
He probably told her
to have an abortion.

324
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:46,740
Even though I did the same,

325
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:50,043
she said she
wanted to have the baby.

326
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:56,016
Then one day I got
a call from the hospital.

327
00:49:56,426 --> 00:50:01,022
They said Yoo-shil needed
someone to take care of her.

328
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:13,574
I thought she'd lock herself up
in her place, so I visited her.

329
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:15,801
But she wasn't there.

330
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,179
So then Yoo-shil...

331
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:27,385
This is Yoo-shil's last present
she sent to me.

332
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,727
Now it's only a relic.

333
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:02,023
Where was the hospital
she checked in to?

334
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,222
Was it Mari Women's Clinic?

335
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,473
When I was opening this clinic,

336
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,579
I hired the nurse
who worked here before,

337
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:25,738
but she had quit.

338
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:29,215
I think she went
to another hospital.

339
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,295
She was pregnant
for eight months.

340
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,962
It was probably that long.
It seemed premature.

341
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:52,232
Enough for it to be
dangerous to give birth.

342
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:57,680
She only had two months left
till her delivery.

343
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:01,944
Oh yeah, there was
a bruise on her abdomen.

344
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:03,918
If she hadn't been treated,

345
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:06,989
then it would've been
very dangerous for her.

346
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:11,392
But she insisted
on having the baby.

347
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,660
Was anybody with her?

348
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:16,157
She had a friend with her.

349
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,462
It was pouring hard that day,

350
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:24,539
but I remember her
because she was so strange.

351
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,167
What was strange about her?

352
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:28,910
The child died.

353
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:33,242
When we conducted the surgery,
it was already dead.

354
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:36,976
But she wanted the remains.

355
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,981
She insisted on it persistently,

356
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,717
so we gave it to her.

357
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:58,964
The girl who painted
that self-portrait.

358
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:04,305
She went to the same hospital
as the other victims.

359
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,316
Are you okay?

360
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:14,984
Yes, I'm okay.

361
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:22,055
What in the world
is behind that site?

362
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:26,999
I think it's a message
sent by someone.

363
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:32,934
I'm looking for the person
who's operating that site.

364
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:35,167
I think that's the most
crucial thing right now.

365
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,405
Even if there is someone,

366
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:40,549
he or she is being
ordered by a spirit.

367
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:46,248
That's a common statement
mentally-ill criminals say.

368
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:49,454
- "Someone told me to."
- People believe that what

369
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,526
they can't see doesn't exist.

370
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,155
But we can even feel
the air invisible to us.

371
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,767
Air is something
that can be proven.

372
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:02,429
But that spirit
is something that can't.

373
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:06,532
I don't believe in God,
but I do believe in spirits.

374
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:11,176
That's my belief in life.

375
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:16,714
You said you saw
yourself die, right?

376
00:54:24,828 --> 00:54:28,286
Soo-jin,
is it true that you're pregnant?

377
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:32,824
Can you explain this?

378
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:39,800
This company doesn't need
to know about my private life.

379
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,638
Just answer the question.

380
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:43,508
Is it true about you two?

381
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,080
Sir, we told you it wasn't.

382
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,749
You keep quiet.

383
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:52,352
Whether it's true or not
is my problem.

384
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:54,354
It has nothing to do
with this company.

385
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,125
Give me time.

386
00:54:57,527 --> 00:54:59,791
So are you going to
announce your marriage?

387
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:01,989
I'm not planning to marry,

388
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:06,431
and I'm not in
the position to do so.

389
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:10,431
You're better off
asking Ei-suk.

390
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,271
Soo-jin.

391
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,270
This has to be solved somehow.

392
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:20,942
If a scandal like this gets out,
this will look bad on us.

393
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,644
I'll talk to the people upstairs,

394
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:28,380
and give you three days.
Until then,

395
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:31,425
I trust you'll solve it, Soo-jin.

396
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:44,834
I really don't get your attitude.

397
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:47,535
Have you ever tried to?

398
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,472
Know how scared
and desperate I am?

399
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:53,681
Your baby is
growing in my belly,

400
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,243
and I can't just do anything
to this baby.

401
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:59,186
You had a chance to solve it,
but why didn't you?

402
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,854
Your idea of solving
it is useless now.

403
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,689
It's me who can't now!

404
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,490
That general manager
is ruthless.

405
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:09,659
You should've denied it.

406
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,033
I told you to say
what we talked about.

407
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,527
I didn't want to lie
disgracefully like that.

408
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,434
Think that innocent way
of thinking will work?

409
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,064
Why'd you make
things complicated?

410
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:21,336
If it doesn't work out,
I'm through.

411
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,444
How could you say that
when I might die?

412
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:26,276
If I lose that anchor spot,
that's just like dying.

413
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:36,489
I'm not done with you yet.

414
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:51,732
How'd you get into this place?

415
00:56:58,214 --> 00:56:59,545
It's related to that case.

416
00:56:59,649 --> 00:57:02,049
How the hell does
that matter to us?

417
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:04,813
One of the victims
died in this apartment.

418
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:07,115
So we came to a
place someone died in?

419
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:18,826
- Let's go.
- No, I can't leave!

420
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:20,727
Where did you
get that painting?

421
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:22,468
It was here before.

422
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:25,801
What are you doing?

423
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,638
I don't like how
this painting looks.

424
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,305
- Throw it away!
- No, just leave it!

425
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,321
Think it'll comfort her?

426
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:47,257
A spirit knows the
minds of the living.

427
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:53,693
She's probably
resting in peace now.

428
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:26,894
Officer Ju.

429
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:31,765
Can you make out this picture?
Over here.

430
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:37,578
Well, I'm not quite sure.

431
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:26,424
I guess it's all over, right?

432
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:31,096
What are you keep looking at?

433
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,874
Can you make out this picture?

434
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,543
Of what?

435
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,224
Well...

436
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:02,861
I'm not too sure.

437
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:10,869
If we ask In-mee,
she might know.

438
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:25,219
Her phone's not working.

439
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,915
It wasn't over.

440
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:31,544
I guess I'm next.

441
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:46,297
I've abandoned you already,

442
01:11:48,704 --> 01:11:51,537
but if you were born
inside of me again,

443
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:57,605
I would be so happy.

444
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:07,411
Finding comfort wasn't
the only thing you wanted.

445
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:12,485
An amulet to fight off all evil

446
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:19,227
You wanted to be born again,

447
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,666
and be loved instead.

448
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:18,148
Ahn In-mee

449
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:22,493
Can you check this part?

450
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:42,149
Can you turn off the lights?

451
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:50,823
See this skull?

452
01:13:51,026 --> 01:13:54,018
This painting is called
"Holbein's Ambassadors."

453
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:58,130
If you twist the
figure's angle like this,

454
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:01,394
a very unfamiliar and distorted
image appears.

455
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:21,482
Can it be a clue?

456
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:24,020
I hope so.

457
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:28,060
It's been a while
since I used this program.

458
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:33,261
It looks like a person's face.

459
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,802
Doesn't he look familiar?

460
01:14:37,873 --> 01:14:39,101
Really?

461
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:41,171
Think sorry is enough?

462
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:44,237
Why'd you screw around
in the first place?

463
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:46,707
I'll take care of it soon.

464
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:49,943
This isn't just
a personal matter, you idiot!

465
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:56,181
Get out.

466
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:03,714
Until now,

467
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:08,521
I thought about how I'll die.

468
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:15,595
I'm going to die
like the rest of them.

469
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:19,873
I was so scared,

470
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:25,778
I had forgotten about
the baby that was in me.

471
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:32,645
I must not have what it takes
to be a genuine woman.

472
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,586
The baby that was mine.

473
01:16:39,995 --> 01:16:43,692
My irresponsible self who
couldn't be responsible for it.

474
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:49,395
I can't even forgive myself.

475
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:55,535
If I could,

476
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:02,345
that cute baby,
the baby I threw away,

477
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,512
I'd like to have it.

478
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:14,589
I want to have it and love it.

479
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:30,472
I need Cho Yoo-shil's diagnosis
sheet when she checked in.

480
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:35,214
I think it's a crucial clue
to this case.

481
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:37,742
I need to know
her boyfriend's name.

482
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,946
Please, Nurse Jung.

483
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:45,292
Hello?

484
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:47,353
Hello, Miss Jung?

485
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:49,386
Pretty and nice.

486
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:52,058
This is probably
what everyone wants.

487
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,898
But in my opinion,

488
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:58,331
I wish we could all do
the best at what we do.

489
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:03,068
Thanks for watching
"Looking at the World".

490
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:05,237
In return for all
your encouragement,

491
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:09,841
I'll repay you with a more
invigorating and fair show.

492
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:11,680
Thank you.

493
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:18,512
Ei-suk?

494
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:22,088
What the hell
are you doing here?

495
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:27,019
What are you doing, huh?

496
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:31,693
It's not too late.

497
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:35,127
Let's go to the hospital, okay?

498
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:40,302
There's no use.

499
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:50,413
You have to
get rid of the baby.

500
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:54,319
I just got my last warning
from the station.

501
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,457
Do you want to ruin my life?

502
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:17,104
Don't come any closer.

503
01:20:21,016 --> 01:20:22,540
Don't come any closer.

504
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:47,340
What's all this?

505
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:50,307
Why do you need it?

506
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:28,415
Why are you trying
to ruin my life, too?

507
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:32,247
Why?
Why? Why?

508
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:34,689
Why? Why?

509
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:45,693
Why are you doing this to me?
Die!

510
01:21:59,314 --> 01:22:00,975
It was you?

511
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:06,882
Yoo-shil's boyfriend was you?

512
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:15,260
Thought you could hold on
to me because of that kid?

513
01:22:20,702 --> 01:22:22,033
It's your kid.

514
01:22:22,904 --> 01:22:24,599
Don't talk like that!

515
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:27,473
My kid?

516
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:32,346
Fine.

517
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:36,615
I'll have to check for myself.

518
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:55,770
What are you doing?

519
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:14,675
This isn't happening.

520
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,117
This is impossible!

521
01:24:49,884 --> 01:24:51,181
Soo-jin!

522
01:24:52,887 --> 01:24:55,117
Soo-jin, wake up.

523
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:57,451
Soo-jin, wake up.

524
01:25:00,562 --> 01:25:04,498
The baby...
Where's my baby?

525
01:25:07,068 --> 01:25:08,831
Where's my baby?

526
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:10,995
- Baby?
- My baby...

527
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:18,635
Soo-jin, there's no baby.
Please calm down.

528
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:23,978
I heard it for sure.

529
01:25:24,419 --> 01:25:28,981
A baby crying.
I bore it.

530
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:31,119
I'm telling you I bore it.

531
01:25:31,493 --> 01:25:33,256
I'm sure I bore it.

532
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:34,919
What are you talking about?

533
01:25:36,197 --> 01:25:40,327
I bore it.
I'm sure I did.

534
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:47,035
I'm sure.
I'm sure I bore it.

535
01:25:49,043 --> 01:25:50,806
Where's my baby?

536
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:53,547
Where's my baby?

537
01:26:56,311 --> 01:26:58,506
Who?

538
01:27:05,587 --> 01:27:07,555
Mister.

539
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:19,558
Can you buy me a drink?
