1
00:00:56,812 --> 00:00:58,723
(motorcycle engine roaring)

2
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,088
(tires screeching)

3
00:01:21,212 --> 00:01:23,009
He's on the way, Mack.

4
00:01:23,092 --> 00:01:26,607
- (Alex) I'll drop him right in your lap.
- We're all set up.

5
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:31,447
Alex, everything by the book.
No stunts and no wrecks today, all right?

6
00:01:35,092 --> 00:01:36,810
(truck horn)

7
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:38,768
Oh, shit!

8
00:01:47,932 --> 00:01:50,810
It's little things I'm trying to get used to.

9
00:01:50,892 --> 00:01:56,125
Like, if I drop my napkin
out in a restaurant, Alex gives me his.

10
00:01:56,212 --> 00:02:00,649
Car door needs opening, he opens it.
My neighbour's abusive? He yells at 'em.

11
00:02:00,732 --> 00:02:04,281
The other night, we were watching a video,
he let me pick it out.

12
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:09,201
D-Do you want to slowly merge into...

13
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:11,328
- Signal first!
- (car horns)

14
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:14,284
Too late. OK.

15
00:02:14,372 --> 00:02:16,522
- That's good.
- All right.

16
00:02:16,612 --> 00:02:19,604
My last boyfriend wasn't the romantic type.

17
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:23,002
Two years ago, for my birthday,
he gives me pepper spray.

18
00:02:23,092 --> 00:02:26,448
I think it's perfume.
I end up in the emergency room.

19
00:02:26,532 --> 00:02:30,605
Relationships based on
extreme circumstances never work out.

20
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,568
Right.

21
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,721
- Right?
- No!

22
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:34,484
Watch the glass!

23
00:02:36,252 --> 00:02:38,607
(horn)

24
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,648
Your boyfriend drive like this?

25
00:02:40,732 --> 00:02:44,361
Oh, Alex? No. No, no, no.
Alex is so completely different.

26
00:02:44,452 --> 00:02:49,731
(Annie) He works... he works beach patrol.
He spends all day on a bicycle in Venice.

27
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,811
Shit.

28
00:03:39,572 --> 00:03:42,006
(Annie)
I'm sure he's on the beach right now.

29
00:03:42,092 --> 00:03:45,004
That's how we met, by the way.
I was jaywalking.

30
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,445
Jaywalking, huh?

31
00:03:46,532 --> 00:03:48,523
Well, jaywalking is a crime.

32
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:51,604
Yeah, but I needed to get across
and at the point...

33
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,125
Dip!

34
00:03:53,212 --> 00:03:54,122
(Annie) Ow.

35
00:03:54,212 --> 00:03:55,008
Another dip!

36
00:03:55,092 --> 00:03:56,161
(thud)

37
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:59,210
Oh! Aagh!

38
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:00,930
Two dips.

39
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:04,527
- It's our seven-month anniversary tonight.
- (sirens)

40
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:06,842
Neither of us has ever dated longer.

41
00:04:06,932 --> 00:04:08,843
Why don't you slow down...

42
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:11,241
...and tell me your problem, huh? Good.

43
00:04:11,332 --> 00:04:12,924
Uh, make a left here.

44
00:04:13,012 --> 00:04:15,606
Uh, turn, signal! Easy!

45
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:35,563
(sirens)

46
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:36,528
Shit!

47
00:04:36,612 --> 00:04:39,285
Miss, pull over to the side, please.

48
00:04:40,532 --> 00:04:43,046
(officer)
Move over to the side, please!

49
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:45,521
- Side.
- I can't! There's a cliff!

50
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:49,450
(Mack) On my command!

51
00:04:49,532 --> 00:04:50,408
Shit!

52
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:58,202
Hold your fire, he's too far!
Everybody in the car!

53
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,565
(man groaning)

54
00:05:41,652 --> 00:05:42,926
You're under arrest.

55
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:45,526
You have the right to remain silent.

56
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:46,567
Ow. That hurt.

57
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:50,563
(officer) Pull over to the side.

58
00:05:50,652 --> 00:05:52,483
- I can't!
- Stop right here.

59
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:57,202
This is absolutely not my fault, Mr Kenter.
I need my license back.

60
00:05:57,292 --> 00:05:58,771
Oh, my God.

61
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:00,046
What? What?

62
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:01,804
Stop! Stop!

63
00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:08,883
(approaching sirens)

64
00:06:11,252 --> 00:06:13,208
You'll never drive in this town again.

65
00:06:14,692 --> 00:06:15,807
(Annie) Alex?

66
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:17,610
Annie.

67
00:06:17,692 --> 00:06:19,808
What... What happened? What...?

68
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:25,803
- How'd the driving test go?
- Oh, it, uh...

69
00:06:26,852 --> 00:06:28,331
Not good. Not good.

70
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:31,051
Um, why aren't you... at the beach?

71
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:33,521
You know, it's funny. There's this...

72
00:06:33,612 --> 00:06:35,045
...perfectly...

73
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:38,920
...reasonable explanation...
- You're a madman, Shaw!

74
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:42,209
Nice working with you, as always.

75
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:44,965
They've apprehended
one of the suspects...

76
00:06:45,052 --> 00:06:47,850
...thanks mainly
to SWAT member Alex Shaw...

77
00:06:47,932 --> 00:06:50,810
...who was the officer injured
in today's chase.

78
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:53,964
- You lied to me.
- I didn't lie about...

79
00:06:54,052 --> 00:06:57,203
You never said
you were on the suicide squad.

80
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,806
You knew I was a cop. I said that I was...

81
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:01,086
Wait.

82
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:03,844
Oh, come on. Ow.

83
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:09,006
When I told you about Jack
and how he was always getting hurt...

84
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:12,528
...and how I would never date
anybody like that again...

85
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:17,208
...you didn't think, "Maybe I should tell her
what I do for a living"?

86
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:19,328
Exactly. And blow it?

87
00:07:20,412 --> 00:07:23,210
- When were you gonna tell me?
- Well, today.

88
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:24,168
Oh, today?

89
00:07:24,252 --> 00:07:27,130
Yeah, today was the day.

90
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:31,410
You know what I pictured you doing
in Venice? I pictured you...

91
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,722
...busting teenage pickpockets...

92
00:07:33,812 --> 00:07:37,009
...walking old women across the street,
drinking lemonade.

93
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:40,243
I do fill in for a friend
at the beach occasionally.

94
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:43,324
And I often, often
enjoy a nice glass of lemonade.

95
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:46,404
You know what?
I feel I don't even know you.

96
00:07:46,492 --> 00:07:49,723
I don't know who you are any more.
I don't understand.

97
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:55,363
We got to spend some time together,
then we'll get to know each other.

98
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:58,649
- Let's go away together.
- OK, where?

99
00:07:58,732 --> 00:07:59,721
The Caribbean.

100
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,770
Oh, the Caribbean.
Do you have a concussion?

101
00:08:02,852 --> 00:08:05,320
We work six days a week, Alex.

102
00:08:05,412 --> 00:08:08,609
We've never even been away
for a... a weekend.

103
00:08:11,572 --> 00:08:14,723
I was going to surprise you tonight,
but, uh...

104
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:19,283
It's a cruise.

105
00:08:20,812 --> 00:08:22,564
This is so unfair, Alex.

106
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:26,088
You can't pull out tickets
to some exotic island...

107
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,766
...and think that'll make everything OK.

108
00:08:28,852 --> 00:08:33,403
I don't expect that I can make it all right,
but, maybe I thought we could.

109
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:34,720
No. Don't do that.

110
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:37,804
I wanna be depressed.
I don't want you to do that.

111
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:38,768
Don't!

112
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,729
All right, all right.

113
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,530
(sighs)

114
00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:44,921
- Don't.
- I won't.

115
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:55,603
(ship's horn)

116
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:15,731
(man) Welcome to the Seabourn Legend.

117
00:09:15,812 --> 00:09:17,370
Thank you. Welcome.

118
00:09:17,452 --> 00:09:19,408
Oh, now, this is a cute couple.

119
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,245
How about a picture? Don't move!

120
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:24,402
- What are your names?
- Annie and Alex.

121
00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:25,720
My name's Dante.

122
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:29,805
- A big smile for the newlyweds?
- (both) Actually, we're not newlyweds.

123
00:09:29,892 --> 00:09:35,091
Only $34.50 for a double set of mugs, and if
you don't like them, you get a photo credit.

124
00:09:35,172 --> 00:09:38,130
Welcome to paradise,
and the name's Dante!

125
00:09:38,212 --> 00:09:40,567
This ship has five passenger decks...

126
00:09:40,652 --> 00:09:42,529
...A, B, C, D, E.

127
00:09:42,612 --> 00:09:44,011
You're on deck C.

128
00:09:44,092 --> 00:09:48,165
There's a swimming pool,
a health spa, a beauty salon, a casino...

129
00:09:48,252 --> 00:09:49,571
Hey. Excuse me.

130
00:09:49,652 --> 00:09:50,721
Sir?

131
00:09:50,812 --> 00:09:54,122
I'm a little upset.
My golf clubs-have you found them?

132
00:09:54,212 --> 00:09:57,807
Yes. They're downstairs in storage
and I'll bring them up...

133
00:09:57,892 --> 00:10:02,807
...as soon as I get
this lovely couple to their cabin.

134
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:12,802
These are the coordinates
for the first leg, Captain.

135
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:14,564
Thank you.

136
00:10:14,652 --> 00:10:15,641
Thruster is in.

137
00:10:15,732 --> 00:10:19,361
- All engines on stand-by.
- Let's take her out, then.

138
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,805
(ship's horn)

139
00:10:20,892 --> 00:10:23,611
Welcome to your suite.

140
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:28,527
Believe me, you'll be sorry to leave room
6088, your happy and humble home.

141
00:10:28,612 --> 00:10:33,561
If you need anything, you just call Ashton.

142
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:36,644
And let me thank you both
in advance for the generous gratuity...

143
00:10:36,732 --> 00:10:38,450
...I know you'll be leaving me
at the end of this cruise.

144
00:10:38,532 --> 00:10:41,092
- Just kidding.
- But not really.

145
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:46,288
Oh. And, you two, have a nice honeymoon.

146
00:10:46,372 --> 00:10:47,930
(both) Oh, we're... we're not...

147
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:50,003
...not married.

148
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:56,811
Thank you.

149
00:10:57,332 --> 00:10:59,163
Thank you.

150
00:10:59,412 --> 00:11:02,768
- Big enough for you?
- Size doesn't matter. You know that.

151
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:03,921
Yes!

152
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:08,443
All of a sudden,
I have Love Boat fever.

153
00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:09,931
It feels really good.

154
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:13,368
I am really excited
about being on a cruise ship.

155
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:15,170
I don't know why.

156
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:18,449
Maybe they pump drugs
through the air-conditioning system.

157
00:11:18,532 --> 00:11:20,363
What do you think?

158
00:11:20,452 --> 00:11:24,161
You know what I need?
Lots of those yummy little drinks...

159
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:27,767
...with those
highly impractical umbrellas in 'em.

160
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:30,605
That is what I need.

161
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:33,331
Yeah, you're looking good.

162
00:11:33,412 --> 00:11:37,200
So, who's ready to party
on the big boat besides me?

163
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,770
You look tense.

164
00:11:41,852 --> 00:11:44,650
Tense? No. We're here to relax.

165
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:46,324
- Let's get a drink.
- Let's go.

166
00:11:46,892 --> 00:11:49,122
We're going to have a really good time.

167
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:56,449
# A Namorada

168
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:19,971
Yeah!

169
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:28,563
Love it!

170
00:12:28,652 --> 00:12:30,290
Thank you.

171
00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:32,283
See you later. Bye.

172
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,571
So, what do you want to do?

173
00:12:40,652 --> 00:12:46,443
Do you want to shuffleboard,
then room or... room, then shuffleboard?

174
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,965
Or hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm?

175
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:49,246
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

176
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:51,482
Room, room.

177
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:52,846
OK.

178
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:57,767
If it's all right with your new boyfriend
over there. Romeo.

179
00:12:57,852 --> 00:12:58,887
His name's Geiger.

180
00:12:58,972 --> 00:13:00,849
- Oh?
- Yes. Yes, we talked.

181
00:13:00,932 --> 00:13:04,971
Not very interested in golf
for someone who had a fit about his clubs.

182
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:07,441
- Why do you say that?
- Well...

183
00:13:07,532 --> 00:13:12,048
...the tournament's on behind him.
He hasn't even glanced at the TV.

184
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:18,130
You're absolutely right. I think
we need to arrest him. Excuse me!

185
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:20,248
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

186
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,642
Aw, honey, you just wanted a hug.

187
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:25,131
You're so sweet.

188
00:13:26,492 --> 00:13:28,369
I got to ask you to do me a favour...

189
00:13:28,452 --> 00:13:31,364
...something I've never
asked you to do before.

190
00:13:31,452 --> 00:13:32,362
What's that?

191
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:36,803
- I need you to boogie with me.
- Oh, no, I don't boogie.

192
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:39,008
Just run in place. Run in place.

193
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:41,401
- Do you feel it?
- Yeah, I think so.

194
00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:42,561
Come on, baby.

195
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:44,529
# A Namorada

196
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,683
(ship's horn)

197
00:14:11,852 --> 00:14:14,127
Wake up, boys.

198
00:15:25,012 --> 00:15:28,129
See, the misconception is that fat is bad.

199
00:15:28,212 --> 00:15:30,328
In order to lose fat, you shouldn't eat fat.

200
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:32,050
Well, guess what, guys?

201
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:34,805
False. Your body's just a giant computer.

202
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,850
Mm. See, if you don't eat fat...

203
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:39,763
...your body's mainframe goes, whoa!

204
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:40,682
Whoa!

205
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:43,570
Better keep whatever fat I've got.

206
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,768
So you see, we at Fatbusters...

207
00:15:45,852 --> 00:15:47,763
...well, we say fat is your friend.

208
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:48,967
Oh, yeah, a good friend, yeah.

209
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:50,201
I could use a good friend.

210
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:52,044
Yeah? Here, meet this guy.

211
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:53,406
- Mmm.
- Good.

212
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:55,130
There you go.

213
00:15:56,132 --> 00:16:00,523
# Take my whole life, too

214
00:16:01,732 --> 00:16:05,202
# I can't help

215
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:11,322
# Falling in love with you #

216
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:13,972
Ladies and gentlemen...

217
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:15,371
...I have a question.

218
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:17,408
Who here would like a peek...

219
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:20,802
...at a multimillion-dollar
jewellery collection?

220
00:16:20,892 --> 00:16:22,644
(applause)

221
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:27,044
OK. On board, we have the Diamond
Jewellers Of America with us tonight.

222
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:30,249
They would like to show you something.

223
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:32,562
Maybe we should get you a little something.

224
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:34,643
I'll take a Camel unfiltered.

225
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:36,643
Aren't you wearing the nicotine patch?

226
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:38,404
The only way that patch is gonna help me...

227
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:40,528
...is if I roll it and smoke it.

228
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:41,761
Good evening.

229
00:16:43,052 --> 00:16:45,441
Big diamond.

230
00:16:45,732 --> 00:16:48,565
# She touches me
in places that I can't explain

231
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:50,961
# She's got a powerful hold on me

232
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:54,485
# The kind of pull
from which I'll never struggle free

233
00:16:54,572 --> 00:16:57,644
# Tell me what to do, tell me is it true

234
00:16:57,732 --> 00:17:00,644
# Do you really love me, girl,
like I love you?

235
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:02,848
# Everything I say, everything I do...

236
00:17:06,252 --> 00:17:08,243
Don't bunny-hop.

237
00:17:32,532 --> 00:17:34,045
That's impressive.

238
00:17:34,132 --> 00:17:36,771
I wanted to learn another language.

239
00:17:36,852 --> 00:17:38,331
Her name is Drew.

240
00:17:42,452 --> 00:17:45,171
She wants to know if you're my sister.

241
00:17:45,252 --> 00:17:46,970
Oh.

242
00:17:47,052 --> 00:17:48,644
Let her down easy.

243
00:17:54,132 --> 00:17:56,771
She says you're very beautiful and...

244
00:17:58,532 --> 00:18:00,523
...our kids will be very beautiful.

245
00:18:02,492 --> 00:18:03,527
Thank you.

246
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:12,569
Uh, can you picture me as a mum?

247
00:18:12,652 --> 00:18:14,370
I think you'd make a beautiful mother.

248
00:18:14,452 --> 00:18:17,649
Just, uh, don't drive the carpool.

249
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:22,964
Jeez. Kids... I don't know.

250
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:25,407
What, kids aren't on the menu?

251
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:26,971
Uh, kids are on the menu.

252
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:29,043
It just depends on who's ordering.

253
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:33,646
- I love it. It's beautiful.
- You're beautiful.

254
00:18:33,732 --> 00:18:36,166
That'll make a great picture.
Hold on. Let me get this one.

255
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:38,846
- Look.
- Look.

256
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:44,527
So, can I order a la carte?

257
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:50,248
I don't know if you're sittin' in my section.

258
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:52,368
I requested this table.

259
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:56,331
Are you a good tipper?

260
00:18:56,412 --> 00:18:58,880
Hmm. Depends on the service.

261
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:02,601
It's always service with a smile for you.

262
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:04,523
How about at every meal?

263
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:07,962
You getting serious right now?

264
00:19:08,052 --> 00:19:09,724
Well...

265
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:12,645
- Yeah, I...
- Wow.

266
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:14,046
I mean...

267
00:19:14,132 --> 00:19:15,281
...wow.

268
00:19:15,372 --> 00:19:17,203
I just, you know, the other day...

269
00:19:17,292 --> 00:19:19,681
...I just found out I'm dating a daredevil...

270
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,763
...so this is like, you know...

271
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:26,242
Oh, you're not serious.

272
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,765
You're not.

273
00:19:27,852 --> 00:19:28,967
(laughing)

274
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:31,566
- Hello?
- Annie?

275
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:33,085
What?

276
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,242
I'm, uh, I'm a little seasick.

277
00:19:35,332 --> 00:19:37,971
Huh? OK.

278
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,849
Let's go.

279
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:17,449
(alarm)

280
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:21,043
(men yelling)

281
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:37,646
(man) I'll get the main valve!

282
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,687
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

283
00:20:55,372 --> 00:20:58,364
I'm sorry, sir. You can't be here right now.

284
00:20:58,452 --> 00:20:59,646
I must be lost.

285
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:03,691
I saw the lights,
thought this was the casino.

286
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:06,650
(man) Uh, sir, please don't touch those!

287
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:11,168
Sure could use a drink.

288
00:21:11,372 --> 00:21:13,761
Any of you gambling men?

289
00:21:13,852 --> 00:21:15,570
- Uh!
- Sir!

290
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,687
Help the gentleman up, please.

291
00:21:16,772 --> 00:21:17,966
OK, sir, come on.

292
00:21:18,052 --> 00:21:19,371
Let's get him up.

293
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:22,364
Sir, may we assist you
to help find your cabin?

294
00:21:22,452 --> 00:21:23,965
Oh, no. I know where it is.

295
00:21:24,052 --> 00:21:26,566
I... I know when I'm not wanted.

296
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:27,767
You guys just...

297
00:21:27,852 --> 00:21:29,922
...watch where you're going.

298
00:21:31,972 --> 00:21:33,769
We'll do just that.

299
00:21:36,692 --> 00:21:37,841
Goodnight, sir.

300
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:40,321
Listen, let's get you back to your room.

301
00:21:51,292 --> 00:21:52,281
Goodnight.

302
00:22:59,452 --> 00:23:01,443
(receiver) Satellite looks good, sir.

303
00:23:01,532 --> 00:23:05,047
We should have
smooth sailing for the rest of the night.

304
00:23:05,132 --> 00:23:07,566
OK, switch us back to autopilot.

305
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:08,801
Switching over now, sir.

306
00:23:08,892 --> 00:23:09,961
That's right.

307
00:23:10,052 --> 00:23:11,770
Switch us over.

308
00:23:11,852 --> 00:23:13,171
(TV) You never let me have any fun.

309
00:23:13,252 --> 00:23:16,642
No fun? You have all the fun in the world.

310
00:23:16,732 --> 00:23:18,643
We have fun together, don't we?

311
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:21,610
Whenever you want something,
I buy it for you automatically.

312
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:24,081
I take you to concerts, museums, movies.

313
00:23:24,172 --> 00:23:25,571
I do all the housework.

314
00:23:25,652 --> 00:23:27,847
Who does the tidying up? I do.

315
00:23:27,932 --> 00:23:29,570
Who does the cooking? I do.

316
00:23:29,652 --> 00:23:32,086
You and l, we have lots of fun.

317
00:23:32,172 --> 00:23:33,844
Don't we, Lolita?

318
00:23:36,972 --> 00:23:38,803
Come here.

319
00:23:38,892 --> 00:23:40,689
(woman singing opera)

320
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,122
Time for group therapy, boys.

321
00:23:56,052 --> 00:23:59,442
Oh. I wouldn't trade you...

322
00:23:59,532 --> 00:24:02,330
...for all the doctors in the world.

323
00:24:05,852 --> 00:24:08,446
Mmm...

324
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:11,251
...you take care of me...

325
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:13,448
...l'll take care of the ship.

326
00:24:22,652 --> 00:24:23,641
(gun fires)

327
00:24:40,092 --> 00:24:41,161
(gun firing)

328
00:24:41,252 --> 00:24:42,241
Mm!

329
00:24:46,332 --> 00:24:48,368
Alex? (coughs)

330
00:24:50,852 --> 00:24:53,241
Annie, Annie.

331
00:24:53,332 --> 00:24:56,449
I've been looking all over the ship for you.

332
00:24:56,532 --> 00:25:00,491
Maybe you should have looked in bed,
where you left me.

333
00:25:00,572 --> 00:25:02,767
You looked so beautiful, I didn't, uh...

334
00:25:02,852 --> 00:25:04,171
...want to wake you up.

335
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,765
Yeah, beautiful woman in bed, naked -

336
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:07,444
...you had to leave. I get that.

337
00:25:07,532 --> 00:25:08,760
So where were you?

338
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:11,446
- Skeet shooting.
- Skeet shooting?

339
00:25:11,532 --> 00:25:12,647
You went skeet shooting, but you couldn't...

340
00:25:12,732 --> 00:25:13,687
Is that our song?

341
00:25:13,772 --> 00:25:15,364
...take one day not to go shooting?

342
00:25:15,452 --> 00:25:16,965
I wish they'd play that over and over again.

343
00:25:17,052 --> 00:25:18,246
I need a little fresh air...

344
00:25:18,332 --> 00:25:22,007
...after an evening tied as one
of the most embarrassing of my adult life.

345
00:25:22,092 --> 00:25:24,162
Oh... if you want me to be honest...

346
00:25:24,252 --> 00:25:27,369
...I kind of like the fact that you got sick.

347
00:25:27,452 --> 00:25:28,965
Well...

348
00:25:29,052 --> 00:25:31,088
...don't quite know how to respond to that.

349
00:25:31,172 --> 00:25:35,848
Well, all I'm saying is
that I just like taking care of you, that's all.

350
00:25:37,732 --> 00:25:42,089
And what I said when
you were joking about that kid thing...

351
00:25:42,172 --> 00:25:44,481
...for a second,
I thought you were completely serious.

352
00:25:44,572 --> 00:25:47,689
I thought
you were actually gonna ask, you know...

353
00:25:47,772 --> 00:25:50,809
...and last night,
when you were basically blacked out...

354
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:53,087
...I was like, he's a cop, and...

355
00:25:53,172 --> 00:25:55,242
...you don't even know his cop number.

356
00:25:55,332 --> 00:25:57,129
My badge number?

357
00:25:57,212 --> 00:25:58,850
Badge number, see?

358
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,207
I don't even know what it's called.

359
00:26:01,292 --> 00:26:03,965
What does my badge number
have to do with anything?

360
00:26:04,052 --> 00:26:06,646
Well, the point is...
is that if you look at it...

361
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:10,008
...we basically don't...
don't even know each other.

362
00:26:10,092 --> 00:26:12,367
And...

363
00:26:12,452 --> 00:26:13,521
Um...

364
00:26:14,932 --> 00:26:16,843
To get that serious and...

365
00:26:17,892 --> 00:26:20,645
...to make that kind of commitment,
I mean...

366
00:26:22,092 --> 00:26:24,048
...it's probably the last thing that...

367
00:26:24,132 --> 00:26:26,441
...that we both need right now, right?

368
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:27,931
Yeah.

369
00:26:30,052 --> 00:26:32,964
(PA) Attention.

370
00:26:33,052 --> 00:26:34,849
If you would like to reserve water skis...

371
00:26:34,932 --> 00:26:37,446
...paddle boats, jet skis,
or wave runners for use...

372
00:26:37,532 --> 00:26:39,568
...while we're docked
at one of our upcoming ports...

373
00:26:39,652 --> 00:26:42,564
Did you feel
we were underdressed last night?

374
00:26:48,812 --> 00:26:50,450
What's this?

375
00:26:50,532 --> 00:26:55,242
Excuse me. I do believe
I had the Do Not Disturb sign on the door.

376
00:26:55,332 --> 00:26:58,165
Actually, it was Make Up Room, Please.

377
00:26:58,252 --> 00:27:00,607
Maybe... maybe you flipped the card.

378
00:27:00,692 --> 00:27:02,922
Maybe I flipped the card.

379
00:27:04,252 --> 00:27:06,049
Let's not split hairs.

380
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,043
(thunder)

381
00:27:26,252 --> 00:27:28,288
(man) Captain on the bridge.

382
00:27:28,372 --> 00:27:29,851
What's wrong, Merced?

383
00:27:29,932 --> 00:27:31,251
I'm late for my guests.

384
00:27:31,332 --> 00:27:33,482
Uh, yeah, I can't explain it, sir.

385
00:27:33,572 --> 00:27:36,040
We're four degrees off course.

386
00:27:36,132 --> 00:27:38,407
Well, switch us back to manual, then.

387
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:40,926
We tried, sir. The autopilot won't go down.

388
00:27:41,932 --> 00:27:44,207
Well, try again.

389
00:27:44,292 --> 00:27:47,841
I did.
I sent an engineer to check the mainframe.

390
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,160
It's all normal.

391
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:51,288
I sent Eric to run a mainframe diagnostic.

392
00:27:51,372 --> 00:27:53,442
Everything seems normal.

393
00:27:53,532 --> 00:27:55,682
Human error.

394
00:27:55,772 --> 00:27:57,364
Must be human error.

395
00:27:58,652 --> 00:28:00,165
Keep an eye on it.

396
00:28:00,252 --> 00:28:01,526
Yes, sir.

397
00:28:11,332 --> 00:28:13,687
# Every move you make

398
00:28:13,772 --> 00:28:14,887
(knock on door)

399
00:28:16,532 --> 00:28:19,808
# Every vow you break

400
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:23,168
# Every step you take

401
00:28:23,252 --> 00:28:26,449
# I'll be watching you

402
00:28:29,572 --> 00:28:31,881
They were out of size 10s.

403
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:34,247
You know,
I told them size didn't matter, but, uh...

404
00:28:34,332 --> 00:28:35,526
...they wouldn't give them to me.

405
00:28:52,332 --> 00:28:54,926
- One more thing.
- What?

406
00:28:56,852 --> 00:28:59,446
I'd like to boogie with you.

407
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,523
We're still four degrees off course.

408
00:29:03,612 --> 00:29:05,330
Did you check the mainframe, Eric?

409
00:29:06,372 --> 00:29:09,045
Captain Pollard, good evening.

410
00:29:09,132 --> 00:29:11,009
How can you be running the ship...

411
00:29:11,092 --> 00:29:12,571
...if you're not on the bridge?

412
00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:14,529
Who is running the ship?

413
00:29:14,612 --> 00:29:17,206
Oh, yeah. I am.

414
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:18,964
What is this? Who are you?

415
00:29:19,052 --> 00:29:22,010
I spent a great many years
developing computer systems...

416
00:29:22,092 --> 00:29:24,242
...for these cruise liners,
including this baby.

417
00:29:24,332 --> 00:29:26,766
And then I got pushed away!

418
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:28,365
What are you talking about?

419
00:29:28,452 --> 00:29:30,568
That's what really infuriates me.

420
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:32,404
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

421
00:29:32,492 --> 00:29:33,971
How dare you!

422
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:38,571
Traditionally speaking...

423
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,246
...isn't it true
the captain goes down with the ship?

424
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:49,924
Aagh!

425
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,409
(women laughing)

426
00:30:02,492 --> 00:30:05,245
- I got one more. Stand right here.
- Oh, OK.

427
00:30:05,332 --> 00:30:06,651
- This is good.
- OK.

428
00:30:06,732 --> 00:30:11,089
Captain, sweetheart, would you mind
taking a picture with my sister and me?

429
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:13,242
No. Not at all.

430
00:30:13,332 --> 00:30:14,481
Get in the middle.

431
00:30:14,572 --> 00:30:15,527
Right here. OK.

432
00:30:18,052 --> 00:30:19,087
Say Dallas.

433
00:30:19,172 --> 00:30:20,287
Dallas.

434
00:30:20,372 --> 00:30:21,282
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

435
00:30:21,372 --> 00:30:23,886
Nice tropical shower.

436
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:27,487
Water's gonna be beautiful tonight, ladies.

437
00:30:30,292 --> 00:30:32,442
Good evening.

438
00:30:37,972 --> 00:30:39,371
No, I'm sorry.

439
00:30:39,452 --> 00:30:41,249
Without a jacket...

440
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:43,641
...that dress is not appropriate.

441
00:30:43,732 --> 00:30:45,165
(woman) Daddy's right.

442
00:30:45,252 --> 00:30:47,971
I like this dress, and it's fine.

443
00:30:48,052 --> 00:30:50,282
No, no, no.

444
00:30:50,492 --> 00:30:53,370
You look like a clown.

445
00:30:53,452 --> 00:30:54,771
No, I don't.

446
00:30:57,172 --> 00:30:58,400
Well, she's fine.

447
00:30:58,492 --> 00:30:59,845
Let her go.

448
00:31:01,852 --> 00:31:03,729
She'll be back.

449
00:31:18,452 --> 00:31:19,521
Ready...

450
00:31:21,852 --> 00:31:22,841
...now.

451
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:29,047
(beeping)

452
00:31:31,452 --> 00:31:33,443
(rumbling)

453
00:31:35,772 --> 00:31:38,127
(alarm buzzing)

454
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,683
What the hell is going on?

455
00:31:44,772 --> 00:31:46,444
I don't know, sir.

456
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:48,841
Where's the chief engineer?

457
00:32:11,452 --> 00:32:14,888
# Let me take you, yeah

458
00:32:14,972 --> 00:32:21,844
# To that place you never been before

459
00:32:22,092 --> 00:32:25,801
# Open up the door to a dream...

460
00:32:25,892 --> 00:32:29,168
This almost seems too perfect, doesn't it?

461
00:32:29,252 --> 00:32:31,368
Want me to step on your feet?

462
00:32:31,452 --> 00:32:32,771
You already did.

463
00:32:32,852 --> 00:32:34,843
Oh. I meant again.

464
00:32:34,932 --> 00:32:35,887
(giggles)

465
00:32:38,012 --> 00:32:39,843
(rumbling and hissing)

466
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,042
Hurry.

467
00:32:48,252 --> 00:32:51,210
- # Oh, whoa
- # Make it

468
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:53,886
# So beautiful

469
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,849
# Hold me close

470
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,365
# And don't let go...

471
00:32:57,452 --> 00:33:02,765
You know, I left you alone this morning
because I needed to be alone to think.

472
00:33:02,852 --> 00:33:04,171
Yeah.

473
00:33:04,252 --> 00:33:07,050
See, the one thing that's got me
through everything in my life...

474
00:33:07,132 --> 00:33:08,963
...the one thing I could always trust...

475
00:33:09,052 --> 00:33:11,282
...has been my instinct.

476
00:33:11,372 --> 00:33:14,921
It has never been more certain
than it is now.

477
00:33:16,532 --> 00:33:18,045
Really?

478
00:33:18,132 --> 00:33:19,565
Yeah.

479
00:33:21,492 --> 00:33:23,369
What are you saying?

480
00:33:23,452 --> 00:33:26,762
What I'm saying is, uh...

481
00:33:28,252 --> 00:33:29,571
...I think that we should...

482
00:33:29,652 --> 00:33:31,290
(explosion)

483
00:33:31,372 --> 00:33:33,408
(screaming)

484
00:33:33,492 --> 00:33:35,164
Oh, man, no. No, no, no, no.

485
00:33:35,252 --> 00:33:37,720
Come on, keep dancing.
Keep dancing. Come on.

486
00:33:42,612 --> 00:33:44,170
Hold up. Hold on.

487
00:33:49,772 --> 00:33:52,605
Jesus Christ! The main pumps are off!

488
00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:55,160
She ain't pumping out!

489
00:33:55,252 --> 00:33:57,447
Shut down engines three and four!

490
00:33:57,532 --> 00:33:58,851
Get out of here!

491
00:34:02,372 --> 00:34:03,361
Sir!

492
00:34:03,452 --> 00:34:05,443
Look, they're not gonna hold.

493
00:34:05,532 --> 00:34:06,408
Sir.

494
00:34:06,492 --> 00:34:09,086
- Find the captain, will you?
- Yes, sir.

495
00:34:22,652 --> 00:34:23,971
Harvey, it's an earthquake!

496
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:25,690
It can't be! We're at sea!

497
00:34:28,772 --> 00:34:29,841
Aagh!

498
00:34:29,932 --> 00:34:31,524
Ooh! Oh!

499
00:34:33,332 --> 00:34:34,765
Look out!

500
00:34:34,852 --> 00:34:36,285
Watch it!

501
00:34:37,652 --> 00:34:38,687
No!

502
00:34:39,532 --> 00:34:41,170
This is my vacation! Damn it!

503
00:34:41,252 --> 00:34:42,844
I had nothing to do with this.

504
00:34:44,892 --> 00:34:46,086
It's not working!

505
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:57,520
(screaming)

506
00:35:23,572 --> 00:35:25,324
(rumbling stops)

507
00:35:30,852 --> 00:35:32,808
(man) It's all right, it's all right.

508
00:35:32,892 --> 00:35:33,768
It's over. It's over.

509
00:35:33,852 --> 00:35:35,649
Ladies and gentleman...

510
00:35:35,732 --> 00:35:37,404
...Im Liza, your cruise director.

511
00:35:37,492 --> 00:35:40,006
Uh, this is only a minor incident.

512
00:35:40,092 --> 00:35:43,004
Everything will be back to normal
in a few moments.

513
00:35:43,092 --> 00:35:45,560
Why do I really not believe her right now?

514
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:46,642
(beeping)

515
00:35:46,732 --> 00:35:49,166
Terminal malfunction, structural trauma.

516
00:35:49,252 --> 00:35:50,924
Take a look at these monitors.

517
00:35:51,012 --> 00:35:53,765
We're losing power all over the ship.

518
00:35:53,852 --> 00:35:55,808
I want all emergency teams in position.

519
00:35:55,892 --> 00:35:57,769
Get the coastguard on the line.

520
00:35:57,852 --> 00:35:59,171
I don't care!

521
00:35:59,252 --> 00:36:01,049
Put me onto engine control!

522
00:36:01,132 --> 00:36:02,451
It's dead.

523
00:36:02,532 --> 00:36:04,409
(man) Try the low frequencies.

524
00:36:04,492 --> 00:36:06,050
The signal's gone. I've got nothing.

525
00:36:07,892 --> 00:36:10,645
Engine three's down, sir.
Can we do anything?

526
00:36:10,732 --> 00:36:12,563
Try and run a link to the engine room.

527
00:36:12,652 --> 00:36:15,007
Joe,
issue hand-held radios to all the crew.

528
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:17,003
And, please, somebody find the captain!

529
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:17,968
Keep trying.

530
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:19,690
The system's not responding.

531
00:36:19,772 --> 00:36:21,967
- Yes?
- (Geiger) Mr Juliano.

532
00:36:22,052 --> 00:36:27,001
Looks like
the Seabourn Legend isn't fairing too well.

533
00:36:27,092 --> 00:36:30,368
I advise you
to start the evacuation procedure.

534
00:36:30,452 --> 00:36:31,885
Who is this?

535
00:36:32,852 --> 00:36:35,161
Someone you should start listening to.

536
00:36:35,252 --> 00:36:37,049
I want you to sound the alarm immediately.

537
00:36:37,132 --> 00:36:39,407
Time is running out.

538
00:36:39,492 --> 00:36:41,801
I can't do that. Only the captain can.

539
00:36:41,892 --> 00:36:44,406
The captain is dead, Mr Juliano...

540
00:36:44,492 --> 00:36:47,370
...which means you're now responsible
for the people on this ship.

541
00:36:47,452 --> 00:36:51,730
Don't waste time radioing the coastguard
or code in an SOS.

542
00:36:51,812 --> 00:36:54,610
I've cut off all outside communication.

543
00:36:55,572 --> 00:36:57,961
You don't understand.
Maritime regulations state that...

544
00:36:58,052 --> 00:37:00,247
Mr Juliano,
you are in command of this vessel.

545
00:37:00,332 --> 00:37:02,971
The authority is yours.

546
00:37:03,052 --> 00:37:05,850
I'll make it easy on you, Mr Juliano.

547
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,685
I'd like you to look at
the emergency fire display.

548
00:37:11,532 --> 00:37:13,363
Look at the port side...

549
00:37:13,452 --> 00:37:17,764
...C deck, section 686 on your display.

550
00:37:19,692 --> 00:37:21,922
What the hell do you think you're doing?

551
00:37:25,772 --> 00:37:27,728
(alarm)

552
00:37:32,452 --> 00:37:34,090
My God.

553
00:37:38,372 --> 00:37:40,044
Oops.

554
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,963
See what you made me do?

555
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,361
OK, just wait a minute. Please.

556
00:37:44,452 --> 00:37:46,841
And now
the forward section on the A deck...

557
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:49,765
...on both sides of the bow thrusters.

558
00:37:55,532 --> 00:38:00,242
Also look at D deck sections 187 and 188.

559
00:38:00,332 --> 00:38:01,845
(beep)

560
00:38:09,692 --> 00:38:11,250
Sir?

561
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:14,847
All the fires are contained
by fire doors, which I control...

562
00:38:14,932 --> 00:38:16,809
...and will open if necessary.

563
00:38:16,892 --> 00:38:19,201
I've positioned charges throughout the ship...

564
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:21,567
...and will set them off without hesitation.

565
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:24,724
Sir, I think you should push the button.

566
00:38:26,692 --> 00:38:30,241
How am I supposed to abandon
the ship while it's moving?

567
00:38:30,332 --> 00:38:32,368
The ship will stop in exactly three minutes.

568
00:38:32,452 --> 00:38:35,125
I give you 15 minutes to evacuate.

569
00:38:36,292 --> 00:38:38,248
Now sound the alarm...

570
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:41,051
...or I'll burn her down.

571
00:38:43,292 --> 00:38:46,648
Sir,
I really think you should push the button.

572
00:38:57,852 --> 00:39:00,366
(ship's horn)

573
00:39:00,452 --> 00:39:01,487
(alarm blaring)

574
00:39:03,532 --> 00:39:05,807
(PA) Attention. Attention, please.

575
00:39:05,892 --> 00:39:08,042
This is the First Officer.

576
00:39:08,132 --> 00:39:11,602
All passengers and crew,
proceed to the muster deck.

577
00:39:11,692 --> 00:39:14,968
The Seabourn Legend
is to be immediately evacuated.

578
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:16,849
This is not a drill.

579
00:39:16,932 --> 00:39:19,241
I repeat, this is not a drill.

580
00:39:19,332 --> 00:39:21,163
Abandon ship for this?

581
00:39:21,252 --> 00:39:23,561
Does that make any sense?

582
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,085
Let's go. Come on.

583
00:39:25,172 --> 00:39:27,049
(man) Everyone through the rear door!

584
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:29,487
- We've got to find Drew.
- We'll find her, sweetheart.

585
00:39:29,572 --> 00:39:31,961
- She can't hear this!
- I know. We'll find her.

586
00:39:32,892 --> 00:39:34,245
No. No, Frank.

587
00:39:34,332 --> 00:39:37,483
No, I have a feeling about this.
Come on.

588
00:39:37,572 --> 00:39:38,846
(PA) Outside, to the muster deck.

589
00:39:38,932 --> 00:39:40,285
Let's go. Follow me.

590
00:39:40,372 --> 00:39:42,363
(PA) Yes, please keep moving.

591
00:39:45,732 --> 00:39:47,563
- Sulphur.
- What?

592
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:49,847
- You smell sulphur?
- What do you mean?

593
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:51,650
Sulphur out of that vent.

594
00:39:51,732 --> 00:39:53,848
I swear I am never leaving the house again.

595
00:39:53,932 --> 00:39:56,571
(PA) Calmly go
immediately to the lifeboat stations.

596
00:39:56,652 --> 00:39:58,244
All hands evacuate.

597
00:39:58,332 --> 00:39:59,651
Engineers and electricians...

598
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:01,211
...abandon your posts...

599
00:40:01,292 --> 00:40:04,170
...and assist passengers
at your lifeboat assignment.

600
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:13,249
(man) This way, ladies and gentlemen!

601
00:40:13,332 --> 00:40:16,244
Please hurry! Please hurry!

602
00:40:20,932 --> 00:40:22,081
(man) Everybody, hang on!

603
00:40:22,172 --> 00:40:23,571
Go!

604
00:40:38,132 --> 00:40:39,247
Hey, no!

605
00:40:39,332 --> 00:40:40,287
No! The doors!

606
00:40:40,372 --> 00:40:41,361
Let me out!

607
00:40:41,452 --> 00:40:42,567
This door won't open!

608
00:40:42,652 --> 00:40:43,562
Let me in there!

609
00:40:51,252 --> 00:40:53,846
(bell ringing)

610
00:40:55,572 --> 00:40:56,846
Come on.

611
00:40:58,132 --> 00:40:59,451
This way. Quickly.

612
00:40:59,532 --> 00:41:00,965
Ask him, Rupert, ask him!

613
00:41:01,052 --> 00:41:02,849
Look,
I've got to speak to someone in charge!

614
00:41:02,932 --> 00:41:04,251
He's loading the lifeboats.

615
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:06,209
You're gonna miss them if we don't hurry.

616
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:07,361
(pounding on door)

617
00:41:07,452 --> 00:41:09,329
Mum!

618
00:41:13,852 --> 00:41:15,444
Ugh!

619
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:17,762
Oh, God.

620
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:20,763
(man) Push away from the ship!

621
00:41:20,852 --> 00:41:22,968
You know what?
I wanna chase something down.

622
00:41:23,052 --> 00:41:24,246
What are you doing?

623
00:41:24,332 --> 00:41:25,845
It seems odd.

624
00:41:25,932 --> 00:41:27,650
They're abandoning ship
in the middle of night.

625
00:41:27,732 --> 00:41:30,041
I'll be right back. Go. Follow the crew.

626
00:41:30,132 --> 00:41:31,360
Uh, no. Alex!

627
00:41:31,452 --> 00:41:33,283
Follow the crew. I'll be right back.

628
00:41:33,372 --> 00:41:34,930
No! Jeez!

629
00:41:35,892 --> 00:41:37,689
Watch your step, ma'am.

630
00:41:37,772 --> 00:41:39,728
Please, please stay seated.

631
00:41:40,972 --> 00:41:42,246
Sorry. Sorry.

632
00:41:42,332 --> 00:41:43,685
Watch your step!

633
00:41:43,772 --> 00:41:45,000
This way!

634
00:41:59,132 --> 00:42:00,406
Huh?

635
00:42:00,492 --> 00:42:02,369
Christ. He's locked us out.

636
00:42:10,332 --> 00:42:11,890
Sir, get yourself to a lifeboat!

637
00:42:11,972 --> 00:42:13,803
Take it easy, man. I'm LAPD.

638
00:42:13,892 --> 00:42:15,450
What? You're what?

639
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:17,170
What is that?

640
00:42:17,252 --> 00:42:19,561
Have any of these fires been confirmed?

641
00:42:19,652 --> 00:42:22,450
We're loading the lifeboats, sir.

642
00:42:22,532 --> 00:42:24,762
Do you need more confirmation than that?

643
00:42:24,852 --> 00:42:25,921
Yeah.

644
00:42:38,852 --> 00:42:40,729
(alarm ringing)

645
00:42:52,572 --> 00:42:54,881
Last boat! Everybody goes right now!

646
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,849
Everybody, into the boat!

647
00:42:56,932 --> 00:42:58,285
That way, folks! Quickly!

648
00:42:58,372 --> 00:42:59,361
Come on, come on.

649
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:00,851
Drew.

650
00:43:00,932 --> 00:43:02,445
Help us, somebody!

651
00:43:02,532 --> 00:43:04,170
Drew wasn't in the room.

652
00:43:04,252 --> 00:43:05,446
Celeste, we have looked everywhere!

653
00:43:05,532 --> 00:43:07,170
You guys,
she's probably on another lifeboat.

654
00:43:07,252 --> 00:43:08,446
But we can't leave without her!

655
00:43:08,532 --> 00:43:09,567
Come on.

656
00:43:09,652 --> 00:43:10,607
I'm sure she's fine.

657
00:43:10,692 --> 00:43:12,967
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

658
00:43:13,052 --> 00:43:15,771
(Rupert) Celeste, there isn't time.
Drew's gotten on another boat.

659
00:43:16,852 --> 00:43:18,968
Who's the officer?

660
00:43:19,052 --> 00:43:20,770
I wanna see my sister!

661
00:43:20,852 --> 00:43:21,967
Go, go, go, go!

662
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:26,763
Alex, come on! It's the last boat!

663
00:43:26,852 --> 00:43:28,968
Come on, sir, we gotta move!

664
00:43:29,052 --> 00:43:30,041
Move it! Quickly!

665
00:43:30,132 --> 00:43:32,771
- Did you find Drew?
- She's not on the boat.

666
00:43:32,852 --> 00:43:33,648
Did someone run a count?

667
00:43:33,732 --> 00:43:35,643
She's probably on another boat, sir.

668
00:43:35,732 --> 00:43:36,847
Now, just get on, OK?

669
00:43:36,932 --> 00:43:38,809
About these fires. Something's strange.

670
00:43:38,892 --> 00:43:41,406
Your board's lit up.
This is sulphur-based smoke.

671
00:43:41,492 --> 00:43:43,448
- It makes no sense.
- Alex, come on.

672
00:43:43,532 --> 00:43:46,092
I can only lower the boat
when the ship isn't moving.

673
00:43:46,172 --> 00:43:47,571
I've got no time left...

674
00:43:47,652 --> 00:43:49,449
...and I don't know
what this guy is capable of!

675
00:43:49,532 --> 00:43:52,285
What guy? What guy?!

676
00:44:04,692 --> 00:44:06,489
We're on our way.

677
00:44:15,492 --> 00:44:16,925
Oh, my God! The boat is moving!

678
00:44:18,532 --> 00:44:20,250
(screaming)

679
00:44:20,332 --> 00:44:22,050
What is happening?

680
00:44:25,932 --> 00:44:27,047
Annie, jump!

681
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:29,441
(Juliano) We have to bring it back up!

682
00:44:29,532 --> 00:44:30,647
Hold on to the rails!

683
00:44:32,932 --> 00:44:34,684
Ensign, what's going on?

684
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,444
The winch must be jammed!

685
00:44:44,052 --> 00:44:46,043
We gotta stop the ship!

686
00:44:46,132 --> 00:44:48,965
I don't have any control!
Now get out of the way!

687
00:44:58,252 --> 00:44:59,970
What...? What...?

688
00:45:00,052 --> 00:45:01,280
What are you doing?

689
00:45:01,372 --> 00:45:02,771
That cable will never hold...

690
00:45:02,852 --> 00:45:04,649
...and we've got to get them out.

691
00:45:04,732 --> 00:45:07,087
What do you mean, we? Alex?

692
00:45:08,732 --> 00:45:10,370
(screaming)

693
00:45:13,572 --> 00:45:15,961
- OK.
- (Annie) You got it?

694
00:45:18,292 --> 00:45:19,520
Be careful.

695
00:45:20,532 --> 00:45:21,851
I'll be right back.

696
00:45:21,932 --> 00:45:23,490
OK.

697
00:45:30,852 --> 00:45:32,649
(sighs)

698
00:45:50,852 --> 00:45:52,888
What the hell is he doing?!

699
00:45:52,972 --> 00:45:55,122
He said he'd be right back!

700
00:46:01,252 --> 00:46:03,561
We better get that end back up!

701
00:46:03,652 --> 00:46:05,643
If it hits the water on that angle...

702
00:46:05,732 --> 00:46:06,721
...it'll collapse!

703
00:46:07,692 --> 00:46:08,647
Don't move!

704
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:09,801
Please!

705
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,848
Please pull us up!

706
00:46:11,932 --> 00:46:13,160
We're trying.

707
00:46:13,252 --> 00:46:15,447
Stay calm and keep the weight balanced.

708
00:46:15,532 --> 00:46:17,682
We'll bring you up one by one.

709
00:46:18,852 --> 00:46:20,365
She's still there!

710
00:46:20,452 --> 00:46:22,249
I know she's still on the ship!

711
00:46:22,332 --> 00:46:23,685
Celeste, where are you going?!

712
00:46:23,772 --> 00:46:25,649
No, no, no! Don't climb out!

713
00:46:25,732 --> 00:46:26,642
Don't... Don't move!

714
00:46:26,732 --> 00:46:27,926
It'll fall!

715
00:46:30,132 --> 00:46:31,929
(screaming)

716
00:46:41,492 --> 00:46:43,289
Oh.

717
00:46:46,532 --> 00:46:48,602
Throw me a rope! I need to attach...

718
00:46:48,692 --> 00:46:51,160
Oh, sweetheart, it's not your fault.

719
00:46:51,252 --> 00:46:54,642
(Annie) OK. Oh, here. OK.

720
00:46:54,732 --> 00:46:56,370
Watch out!

721
00:46:56,452 --> 00:46:59,046
Now, get the rope! Grab the rope!

722
00:46:59,132 --> 00:47:00,565
I'll get it!

723
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:01,641
(Alex) Careful!

724
00:47:02,852 --> 00:47:04,649
I got the rope!

725
00:47:04,732 --> 00:47:06,643
Tie it up to the hull!

726
00:47:06,732 --> 00:47:08,245
Pull the slack!

727
00:47:08,332 --> 00:47:09,765
Be careful!

728
00:47:09,852 --> 00:47:11,126
OK!

729
00:47:12,772 --> 00:47:13,966
Whoa! Whoa! Aah!

730
00:47:14,052 --> 00:47:15,644
(screaming)

731
00:47:17,092 --> 00:47:18,241
Whoa! Whoa!

732
00:47:18,332 --> 00:47:19,970
Hold on! Pull them up!

733
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,651
Whoa!

734
00:47:22,732 --> 00:47:23,608
Aagh!

735
00:47:23,692 --> 00:47:25,045
Help!

736
00:47:25,132 --> 00:47:27,009
Alex! Alex!

737
00:47:27,092 --> 00:47:28,923
Dante!

738
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:32,645
Help! Help!

739
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:36,367
(grunts)

740
00:47:37,652 --> 00:47:40,041
Help! Help!

741
00:47:42,132 --> 00:47:43,451
Oh! Help!

742
00:47:43,532 --> 00:47:44,647
Help!

743
00:47:51,732 --> 00:47:52,767
Come on.

744
00:47:52,852 --> 00:47:54,968
Pull me up, please! Pull!

745
00:47:55,052 --> 00:47:57,486
Alex! God. Yes, you are nuts.

746
00:47:57,572 --> 00:47:59,847
- Come on. Pull me up.
- I got you.

747
00:47:59,932 --> 00:48:00,921
Please pull!

748
00:48:02,532 --> 00:48:03,851
(Alex) Get another line!

749
00:48:03,932 --> 00:48:05,365
Quickly! Get another line!

750
00:48:05,452 --> 00:48:06,851
(groans)

751
00:48:07,852 --> 00:48:10,969
There has to be something else!

752
00:48:12,132 --> 00:48:14,441
The gangplank! Get the gangplank!

753
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:35,842
Alex. Alex, Alex.

754
00:48:35,932 --> 00:48:37,763
Hi, uh...

755
00:48:37,852 --> 00:48:40,366
Get everybody on here if you can.

756
00:48:41,372 --> 00:48:42,487
OK.

757
00:48:43,452 --> 00:48:45,443
OK. Thanks, man.

758
00:48:45,532 --> 00:48:48,046
Thank you. OK, thanks.

759
00:48:48,132 --> 00:48:49,121
(Annie) OK.

760
00:49:22,732 --> 00:49:23,767
Thank you.

761
00:49:23,852 --> 00:49:26,366
That's the last one, sir.

762
00:49:26,452 --> 00:49:27,771
(beeping)

763
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,643
Officer, it's Merced.

764
00:49:30,732 --> 00:49:32,802
- (beeping)
- Yes?

765
00:49:32,892 --> 00:49:35,042
(Merced)
We have a situation on the bridge.

766
00:49:35,132 --> 00:49:36,963
I bet we do!

767
00:49:37,052 --> 00:49:38,405
Keep everybody together, Rudy.

768
00:49:38,492 --> 00:49:39,845
I'll be on the bridge.

769
00:49:39,932 --> 00:49:41,968
Stay with the passengers.

770
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:43,088
(alarm ringing)

771
00:49:56,612 --> 00:49:57,840
It's the radar.

772
00:49:57,932 --> 00:50:00,127
First I thought this was a heavy fog bank,
but it's not moving.

773
00:50:02,503 --> 00:50:04,221
(keystrokes)

774
00:50:04,303 --> 00:50:06,214
(Juliano) Saint Martin.

775
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:08,942
Well, there is a harbour on Saint Martin.

776
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,900
He must be stopping us on the island.

777
00:50:10,983 --> 00:50:13,372
What's the heading?

778
00:50:13,463 --> 00:50:17,422
It is full at southeast 165.

779
00:50:17,503 --> 00:50:19,095
You think that's where he's taking us?

780
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,821
You think that's the harbour?

781
00:50:25,303 --> 00:50:28,693
He's taking us to the cliffs
next to the harbour.

782
00:50:31,383 --> 00:50:33,897
He's gonna slam us into a wall.

783
00:50:33,983 --> 00:50:35,780
How long before we hit?

784
00:50:35,863 --> 00:50:37,694
Sir, get back with the other passengers.

785
00:50:37,783 --> 00:50:39,182
How much time have we got?

786
00:50:39,263 --> 00:50:40,093
I'm the first officer on this ship, OK...

787
00:50:40,183 --> 00:50:41,138
...and you're...

788
00:50:41,223 --> 00:50:44,898
You've lost control of autopilot,
so there's got to be a hard wire link.

789
00:50:44,983 --> 00:50:46,382
Yes, that's exactly right, sir.

790
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:49,535
But he's running it all by remote,
and there's nothing you can do.

791
00:50:49,623 --> 00:50:51,739
We gotta find the transmitter.

792
00:50:51,823 --> 00:50:53,814
So how's he transmitting the fires?!

793
00:50:53,903 --> 00:50:56,019
The fires don't exist. They're not real.

794
00:50:56,103 --> 00:50:57,980
Smoke canisters. Stun grenades.

795
00:50:58,063 --> 00:50:59,416
Probably put them in the air ducts.

796
00:50:59,503 --> 00:51:00,731
They're small.

797
00:51:00,823 --> 00:51:02,381
They roll...

798
00:51:02,463 --> 00:51:03,737
...like...

799
00:51:03,823 --> 00:51:05,051
...these.

800
00:51:07,863 --> 00:51:08,898
Golf balls.

801
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:11,372
Golf balls, golf balls.

802
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:14,180
Geiger. Let's go get him right now.

803
00:51:14,263 --> 00:51:16,094
Get his cabin number.
We'll get him. I'll get him.

804
00:51:16,183 --> 00:51:17,013
We're locked out.

805
00:51:17,103 --> 00:51:18,138
Where are the skeet guns?

806
00:51:18,223 --> 00:51:19,576
Right here.

807
00:51:36,783 --> 00:51:39,172
- (thump)
- (man) Ow.

808
00:51:46,063 --> 00:51:47,894
Aagh!

809
00:51:47,983 --> 00:51:49,814
Why's everyone trying to kill me?!

810
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:53,336
What happened? Are you OK?

811
00:51:53,423 --> 00:51:54,299
Ow. Ow.

812
00:51:54,383 --> 00:51:55,896
(Juliano) Stay down, stay down.

813
00:51:55,983 --> 00:51:58,213
You're OK.

814
00:51:58,303 --> 00:52:02,012
I can't override it.
He's changed all the access codes.

815
00:52:08,663 --> 00:52:10,733
We have a very sick boy.

816
00:52:10,823 --> 00:52:11,699
(Geiger) Exactly.

817
00:52:11,783 --> 00:52:15,981
Do you think I'd be doing this,
if I still had my health?

818
00:52:16,063 --> 00:52:17,496
It ends now.

819
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:19,141
I know who you are.

820
00:52:19,223 --> 00:52:21,293
I know you, too.

821
00:52:21,383 --> 00:52:23,180
You look a little wet.

822
00:52:23,263 --> 00:52:24,981
You see, Alex...

823
00:52:25,063 --> 00:52:27,896
...I designed this whole autopilot system.

824
00:52:27,983 --> 00:52:31,293
My company sold it off to almost
every shipping line in the world...

825
00:52:31,383 --> 00:52:34,978
...but when I got sick, they fired me.

826
00:52:36,383 --> 00:52:39,181
I had no defence. They just threw me away.

827
00:52:39,263 --> 00:52:42,858
But now I have
a more aggressive defence system.

828
00:52:42,943 --> 00:52:43,932
(beep)

829
00:52:44,023 --> 00:52:45,581
Tell me, Alex...

830
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:49,497
...did you ever have
a false sense of security?

831
00:52:55,023 --> 00:52:55,978
Aagh!

832
00:52:58,183 --> 00:52:59,013
(explosion)

833
00:52:59,103 --> 00:53:01,742
Everybody, to the deck!

834
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,017
Go! Go! Go!

835
00:53:04,063 --> 00:53:05,212
(chuckles)

836
00:53:05,303 --> 00:53:07,021
Nothing's secure, Alex.

837
00:53:07,103 --> 00:53:08,821
(coughing)

838
00:53:12,383 --> 00:53:13,418
That was odd.

839
00:53:13,503 --> 00:53:15,095
You call that odd?
What kind of cop are you?

840
00:53:15,183 --> 00:53:16,502
You're gonna get us all killed!

841
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:18,175
No, that's his plan.

842
00:53:18,263 --> 00:53:20,174
Where's engine control?

843
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:21,582
What? Engine control?

844
00:53:21,663 --> 00:53:23,096
We're gonna stop the ship,
then we're gonna get him.

845
00:53:23,183 --> 00:53:24,377
I want you on the upper deck
with the other passengers!

846
00:53:24,463 --> 00:53:25,896
Fine! I'll find it on my own!

847
00:53:25,983 --> 00:53:26,972
Merced, go with him!

848
00:53:27,063 --> 00:53:28,894
Sir, he's highly irrational.

849
00:53:28,983 --> 00:53:30,814
You're an officer on this ship.

850
00:53:30,903 --> 00:53:33,292
Now, make sure he doesn't touch a thing!

851
00:53:34,263 --> 00:53:36,618
Ashton, you OK? Come on, get up.

852
00:53:36,783 --> 00:53:38,102
(man) Keep it moving.

853
00:53:38,183 --> 00:53:40,743
Annie. They won't organize a search...

854
00:53:40,823 --> 00:53:42,779
...but I know Drew didn't get away.

855
00:53:42,863 --> 00:53:44,694
She's got to be here somewhere!

856
00:53:44,783 --> 00:53:47,581
- They'll find her.
- Just keep it moving.

857
00:53:47,663 --> 00:53:49,016
(hollow metal pounding)

858
00:53:49,103 --> 00:53:50,092
This way!

859
00:53:50,183 --> 00:53:51,901
Hello, miss. This way.

860
00:53:52,903 --> 00:53:55,895
Dante, stop it.
Do you hear that? Listen.

861
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,701
Yeah,
I hear something coming from down there.

862
00:53:57,783 --> 00:53:59,216
Where? Show me. Come on.

863
00:53:59,303 --> 00:54:01,658
- (hollow metal pounding)
- (woman) Harder!

864
00:54:01,743 --> 00:54:03,699
Can anybody hear?! Hello!

865
00:54:03,783 --> 00:54:05,375
Alejandro, I don't like this.

866
00:54:05,463 --> 00:54:06,976
I really don't like this.

867
00:54:07,063 --> 00:54:08,894
It's coming from down here somewhere.

868
00:54:10,503 --> 00:54:11,652
(Alejandro) Anyone!

869
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,493
(Alejandro) Hello!

870
00:54:16,383 --> 00:54:17,816
Is anybody in there?!

871
00:54:17,903 --> 00:54:19,382
Yes!

872
00:54:19,463 --> 00:54:20,782
Yes, we're trapped!

873
00:54:20,863 --> 00:54:23,172
Get us the hell out of here!

874
00:54:23,263 --> 00:54:24,139
We're trying!

875
00:54:24,223 --> 00:54:26,498
Is there a little girl in there? Drew?

876
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:28,699
No! Just big women!

877
00:54:28,783 --> 00:54:29,932
Excuse me!

878
00:54:30,023 --> 00:54:32,696
I mean, normal-sized women!
Come on, get us out of here!

879
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:36,019
Oh, my God,
there's smoke coming out of the vent!

880
00:54:36,103 --> 00:54:37,502
(woman) Everybody get back!

881
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:39,380
It's coming out everywhere!

882
00:54:39,463 --> 00:54:40,373
Ow. We're trying.

883
00:54:40,463 --> 00:54:42,215
Try to block the vent!

884
00:54:42,303 --> 00:54:43,452
Don't worry. We'll get you out!

885
00:55:03,223 --> 00:55:05,100
What are you doing?

886
00:55:05,183 --> 00:55:06,901
They told us to block the vents.

887
00:55:06,983 --> 00:55:07,813
She's right.

888
00:55:07,903 --> 00:55:09,416
I'll help you, lady.

889
00:55:09,503 --> 00:55:10,902
Alejandro, qué pasa?

890
00:55:10,983 --> 00:55:13,417
This smoke's gonna kill us off.

891
00:55:13,503 --> 00:55:14,902
(Dante) Everybody just hang on!

892
00:55:14,983 --> 00:55:16,302
We'll get you out in a second!

893
00:55:16,383 --> 00:55:17,782
Help me, Harvey!

894
00:55:17,863 --> 00:55:19,819
I'm trying to save your life!

895
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:21,302
(Dante) Just hang on!

896
00:55:21,383 --> 00:55:22,736
OK. What is this?

897
00:55:22,823 --> 00:55:23,972
Try that.

898
00:55:24,063 --> 00:55:28,614
- This... this won't work.
- Just try it. I'll find something else.

899
00:55:31,503 --> 00:55:34,176
I told you this won't work!

900
00:55:34,263 --> 00:55:35,696
(coughing)

901
00:55:35,783 --> 00:55:38,092
It's coming out everywhere.
Harv, give me your pants!

902
00:55:38,183 --> 00:55:40,413
My pants?!
No-one else is taking off their pants.

903
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:41,618
I took off mine.

904
00:55:41,703 --> 00:55:44,297
Why hasn't she taken anything off yet?

905
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,022
Cos I'm not wearing any underwear,
Harvey.

906
00:55:48,103 --> 00:55:49,582
Oh.

907
00:55:49,663 --> 00:55:51,733
(woman) I can't breathe.

908
00:55:51,823 --> 00:55:53,700
(man) Come on, hurry up!

909
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:55,011
Come on!

910
00:55:58,943 --> 00:56:00,376
What do we have?

911
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:08,580
Yeah, this'll do.

912
00:56:13,463 --> 00:56:14,976
This will do.

913
00:56:16,263 --> 00:56:19,141
Did you try
to close the fuel tanks manually?

914
00:56:19,223 --> 00:56:22,772
Yeah, but he's sealed off
all access to engine room four.

915
00:56:26,063 --> 00:56:27,496
Which of these controls the autopilot?

916
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:29,380
I don't know. I'm the navigator.

917
00:56:29,463 --> 00:56:31,294
I'm not familiar with this equipment.

918
00:56:31,383 --> 00:56:32,702
Oh, you're not familiar?

919
00:56:32,783 --> 00:56:33,772
I see.

920
00:56:35,023 --> 00:56:36,376
Are you, uh...

921
00:56:36,463 --> 00:56:37,896
...familiar with this?

922
00:56:43,663 --> 00:56:45,335
Sir, this is Merced in engine control!

923
00:56:45,423 --> 00:56:47,379
He's smashing up all the equipment!

924
00:56:47,463 --> 00:56:48,896
Do you copy?

925
00:56:48,983 --> 00:56:50,939
Which of these
is not hooked up to the computer?

926
00:56:51,023 --> 00:56:53,378
There's plenty
not hooked up to the computer...

927
00:56:53,463 --> 00:56:55,294
...but nothing that overrides his programme.

928
00:56:55,383 --> 00:56:57,214
Then we have to fool his programme.

929
00:56:57,303 --> 00:56:59,533
We cannot stop the ship.

930
00:56:59,623 --> 00:57:01,181
I wanna slow it down.

931
00:57:01,263 --> 00:57:02,696
What you gonna do now?

932
00:57:02,783 --> 00:57:05,092
You gonna let the air out of our tires?

933
00:57:05,183 --> 00:57:07,219
- What are these switches?
- Don't you touch them!

934
00:57:07,303 --> 00:57:10,215
They open the ballast doors!
You wanna flood the ship?!

935
00:57:12,423 --> 00:57:15,540
Sir, this is Merced! Does anybody copy?

936
00:57:15,623 --> 00:57:16,976
Hello? Somebody answer me!

937
00:57:17,063 --> 00:57:19,623
We're gonna flood the ship like you said.

938
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:21,500
What are you talking about?

939
00:57:21,583 --> 00:57:22,902
Might slow her down.

940
00:57:22,983 --> 00:57:24,814
Right, you shut up! You shut your mouth!

941
00:57:24,903 --> 00:57:26,302
I never said that!

942
00:57:26,383 --> 00:57:28,180
If we take on too much water...

943
00:57:28,263 --> 00:57:30,094
...we'll all go down.

944
00:57:30,183 --> 00:57:31,457
Sir! Somebody answer me!

945
00:57:31,543 --> 00:57:32,817
Listen...

946
00:57:36,423 --> 00:57:38,379
Flood it.

947
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:48,501
It's not working!

948
00:57:48,623 --> 00:57:49,692
Will you hurry up?!

949
00:57:50,823 --> 00:57:53,132
Wait. Dante, I think I've got something.

950
00:57:53,223 --> 00:57:54,292
Whoa.

951
00:57:54,383 --> 00:57:55,896
Everybody, back off!

952
00:57:55,983 --> 00:57:57,496
Hurry up! Hurry up!

953
00:57:57,583 --> 00:57:58,777
Yeah, we found the key.

954
00:57:58,863 --> 00:57:59,739
(chain saw rewing)

955
00:57:59,823 --> 00:58:00,619
What?

956
00:58:20,223 --> 00:58:21,372
OK, OK.

957
00:58:21,463 --> 00:58:23,340
Kick. Can you kick it?

958
00:58:23,423 --> 00:58:25,095
Look out!

959
00:58:25,183 --> 00:58:27,492
- (chain saw rewing)
- Aagh!

960
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:28,982
Can you get out?

961
00:58:29,983 --> 00:58:31,302
Can you guys get out?

962
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:33,977
If you'll back off with the saw.

963
00:58:34,063 --> 00:58:34,973
What?!

964
00:58:35,063 --> 00:58:39,341
If you'll back off with the saw,
we'll give it a try!

965
00:58:39,423 --> 00:58:42,176
Oh, sorry! I'm sorry. Sorry.

966
00:58:48,383 --> 00:58:49,702
How much longer?

967
00:58:49,783 --> 00:58:52,581
I've never let a million gallons of water
into a ship before.

968
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:53,982
Give me a second.

969
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:58,215
I've got three watertight doors to close...

970
00:58:58,303 --> 00:59:01,261
...and I've got to shut off
these sensors as well.

971
00:59:02,383 --> 00:59:04,499
Where's this?

972
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:05,936
That's the ballast room.

973
00:59:06,023 --> 00:59:08,173
That's right underneath us.

974
00:59:08,263 --> 00:59:10,538
That's what we're flooding.

975
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:15,694
All right, watertight doors are closed.

976
00:59:15,783 --> 00:59:17,501
Ballast doors should open any minute.

977
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:19,494
Shit!

978
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:21,414
Close it! Close it!

979
00:59:21,503 --> 00:59:23,733
You just told me to open them!

980
00:59:23,823 --> 00:59:24,858
(alarm blaring)

981
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,382
Follow me.

982
00:59:49,183 --> 00:59:53,176
I can't close it just like that.

983
00:59:54,383 --> 00:59:56,817
(Alex) Don't let go of me!

984
00:59:56,903 --> 00:59:57,858
(Drew gasps)

985
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:08,380
(Drew gasps)

986
01:00:53,463 --> 01:00:56,694
Hold on! Hold on!

987
01:00:56,783 --> 01:00:59,251
I'll... I'll hold on.

988
01:01:23,223 --> 01:01:24,576
You OK?

989
01:01:24,663 --> 01:01:26,176
You're gonna be fine.

990
01:01:26,263 --> 01:01:27,457
Hmm. Huh?

991
01:01:29,503 --> 01:01:31,300
In case anything happens...

992
01:01:31,383 --> 01:01:33,135
...to us...

993
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:35,134
...you want me to know that...

994
01:01:35,223 --> 01:01:37,896
...you... you...

995
01:01:37,983 --> 01:01:39,416
...love me...

996
01:01:40,783 --> 01:01:43,661
...and that you're gonna be 15 next month.

997
01:01:47,663 --> 01:01:49,972
Relationships
based on extreme circumstances...

998
01:01:50,063 --> 01:01:52,054
...they rarely work out.

999
01:02:01,863 --> 01:02:03,296
(Liza) This way, everybody!

1000
01:02:03,383 --> 01:02:06,102
What's going on?
Why has the evacuation stopped?

1001
01:02:06,183 --> 01:02:08,617
(woman)
Stopped? We didn't even start.

1002
01:02:08,703 --> 01:02:10,136
Are we sinking? Are we gonna die?

1003
01:02:10,223 --> 01:02:12,942
- The important thing is to stay calm.
- You don't even work here!

1004
01:02:13,023 --> 01:02:16,902
I've been in worse situations than this
and panicking does not help.

1005
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,621
We have our life vests.
We can jump off the ship.

1006
01:02:18,703 --> 01:02:21,012
You'd get sucked into the propellers.

1007
01:02:21,103 --> 01:02:23,663
(sighs) Yeah, that would suck.

1008
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:27,580
Alex.

1009
01:02:27,663 --> 01:02:29,301
Oh, my God. Drew.

1010
01:02:29,383 --> 01:02:30,372
Where you been, huh?

1011
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:34,096
- Is she OK?
- We'll find your mum.

1012
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:35,093
She all right?

1013
01:02:35,183 --> 01:02:36,013
Yeah.

1014
01:02:37,063 --> 01:02:38,337
Come on, sweetheart.

1015
01:02:38,423 --> 01:02:39,299
(Alex) You OK?

1016
01:02:39,383 --> 01:02:40,816
Yeah, I'm fine. What's happening?

1017
01:02:40,903 --> 01:02:42,302
Why did the ship start up again?

1018
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:44,180
Why... why did you leave me upstairs?

1019
01:02:44,263 --> 01:02:45,696
(breathing heavily)

1020
01:02:47,183 --> 01:02:48,935
We have a situation.

1021
01:02:49,023 --> 01:02:51,139
I know we have a situation. What?

1022
01:02:51,223 --> 01:02:52,815
Geiger's taken over the ship.

1023
01:02:52,903 --> 01:02:55,701
Geiger.
I'm-not-looking-at-my-golf-game Geiger?

1024
01:02:55,783 --> 01:02:59,093
No, Geiger I'm-a-computer-psycho,
Geiger l-designed-all-the-software...

1025
01:02:59,183 --> 01:03:00,935
...and Geiger l-can-blow-up-everything.

1026
01:03:01,023 --> 01:03:02,422
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know.

1027
01:03:02,503 --> 01:03:06,098
- Where is he?
- He's everywhere. Come up here.

1028
01:03:07,223 --> 01:03:09,418
(door opens and shuts)

1029
01:03:09,503 --> 01:03:11,095
(Alex) That's him.

1030
01:03:11,183 --> 01:03:12,502
What?

1031
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:15,336
Go up to the top deck with everyone.

1032
01:03:15,423 --> 01:03:17,220
You stay. You stay, and you wait.

1033
01:03:17,303 --> 01:03:19,897
Hey, you don't have to save this ship.

1034
01:03:26,623 --> 01:03:27,897
(sighs)

1035
01:03:55,023 --> 01:03:56,536
Freeze!

1036
01:03:56,623 --> 01:03:58,579
Drop the weapon.

1037
01:03:58,663 --> 01:04:00,540
Don't shoot.

1038
01:04:00,623 --> 01:04:02,295
It's not a gun, it's just a computer.

1039
01:04:02,383 --> 01:04:03,702
Drop it, asshole.

1040
01:04:03,783 --> 01:04:04,693
Where's your friend Annie?

1041
01:04:04,783 --> 01:04:06,739
She's cute.

1042
01:04:06,823 --> 01:04:09,735
It would be a shame
if anything happened to her.

1043
01:04:09,823 --> 01:04:10,699
(gunshot)

1044
01:04:10,783 --> 01:04:12,136
Hit the floor now!

1045
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:13,941
(pumps shotgun)

1046
01:04:14,023 --> 01:04:16,139
I was just trying to make conversation.

1047
01:04:16,223 --> 01:04:18,976
I'm putting it down now...

1048
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:20,860
...real slow.

1049
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:27,212
(gunshot)

1050
01:04:50,983 --> 01:04:52,621
(pumps shotgun)

1051
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:05,535
(Geiger on PA)
The irony of my situation, Alex...

1052
01:05:05,623 --> 01:05:07,102
...is that dedication to job...

1053
01:05:07,183 --> 01:05:09,014
...and devotion to the company...

1054
01:05:09,103 --> 01:05:11,298
...was repaid with a terminal illness.

1055
01:05:14,383 --> 01:05:17,102
You see, computers
generate electromagnetic fields...

1056
01:05:17,183 --> 01:05:18,582
...which, over time...

1057
01:05:18,663 --> 01:05:21,541
...can cause severe copper poisoning.

1058
01:05:21,623 --> 01:05:22,976
(Geiger chuckles)

1059
01:05:23,063 --> 01:05:25,372
I'm a smart guy, Alex...

1060
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,772
...and even I didn't know that.

1061
01:05:27,863 --> 01:05:30,013
I would have really appreciated...

1062
01:05:30,103 --> 01:05:32,571
...some understanding
from upper management.

1063
01:05:32,663 --> 01:05:33,539
OK, is everybody OK?

1064
01:05:33,623 --> 01:05:34,499
We're fine.

1065
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:36,175
(Geiger) But, no. They dropped me.

1066
01:05:36,263 --> 01:05:37,742
(gunshot)

1067
01:05:37,823 --> 01:05:39,779
(Geiger)
They treated me like I never existed.

1068
01:05:39,863 --> 01:05:40,978
Where are you going?

1069
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:42,416
I'll go find him.

1070
01:05:42,503 --> 01:05:44,175
Hang on. Wait!

1071
01:05:44,263 --> 01:05:46,777
Now, I just gotta do whatever I can...

1072
01:05:48,063 --> 01:05:50,782
...to get whatever I can get.

1073
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:53,138
You're not gonna stop me.

1074
01:05:53,223 --> 01:05:56,260
This time it's goodbye for good, Alex.

1075
01:06:04,303 --> 01:06:05,258
(gasps)

1076
01:06:07,183 --> 01:06:08,662
(door sliding shut)

1077
01:06:09,863 --> 01:06:12,935
How you gonna stop me now, my friend?

1078
01:06:13,023 --> 01:06:13,978
(opens chamber)

1079
01:06:19,783 --> 01:06:20,818
(Geiger laughs)

1080
01:06:29,423 --> 01:06:30,856
Damn it.

1081
01:06:53,263 --> 01:06:54,173
Damn.

1082
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,092
(stereo on)

1083
01:06:56,183 --> 01:06:58,299
# I feel the earth move

1084
01:06:58,383 --> 01:06:59,782
# Under my feet...

1085
01:06:59,863 --> 01:07:01,694
(fire alarm)

1086
01:07:03,183 --> 01:07:04,172
# I feel my heart...

1087
01:07:04,263 --> 01:07:06,777
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1088
01:07:06,863 --> 01:07:08,501
I've heard that music before.

1089
01:07:08,583 --> 01:07:10,380
They pipe it in all over the ship.

1090
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,499
No, no, no. I've heard this music before.

1091
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:14,972
Ship-shopping music. He's in the mall.

1092
01:07:25,383 --> 01:07:26,702
There's a fire in there.

1093
01:07:26,783 --> 01:07:27,693
Well, don't worry.

1094
01:07:27,783 --> 01:07:29,455
The flames can't get past the fire doors.

1095
01:07:42,383 --> 01:07:43,213
Alex.

1096
01:07:43,303 --> 01:07:44,179
Alex, Alex.

1097
01:07:44,263 --> 01:07:46,299
Don't touch that!

1098
01:07:46,383 --> 01:07:48,772
OK, um, I need a... I need a...

1099
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:51,297
I need my saw.

1100
01:07:51,383 --> 01:07:52,293
Alex! Alex!

1101
01:07:52,383 --> 01:07:53,782
(pounding)

1102
01:07:53,863 --> 01:07:55,216
Alex! Oh, God.

1103
01:07:55,303 --> 01:07:57,737
Don't touch anything. Don't touch anything!

1104
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,336
I know where to release the fire doors.

1105
01:07:59,423 --> 01:08:01,095
Don't open the door. It's a trap.

1106
01:08:01,183 --> 01:08:02,093
There's something in the door.

1107
01:08:02,183 --> 01:08:03,616
Baby, we can't get in to you.

1108
01:08:03,703 --> 01:08:05,136
There's something in the door.

1109
01:08:05,223 --> 01:08:06,975
What does it look like?

1110
01:08:07,063 --> 01:08:08,416
Wait. What does is look like?

1111
01:08:08,503 --> 01:08:09,902
OK, it's green...

1112
01:08:09,983 --> 01:08:11,780
...like a spray deodorant can.

1113
01:08:11,863 --> 01:08:13,899
I don't know. Can't think.

1114
01:08:13,983 --> 01:08:15,814
OK. It's a grenade.

1115
01:08:15,903 --> 01:08:16,892
What?

1116
01:08:16,983 --> 01:08:18,177
There's a number on it.

1117
01:08:18,263 --> 01:08:20,140
There should be a number on it.

1118
01:08:20,223 --> 01:08:23,340
Uh, OK, yeah. It's um... L-1619...

1119
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:25,778
...uh... Magnum.

1120
01:08:25,863 --> 01:08:27,774
- Is the pin out?
- What?

1121
01:08:27,863 --> 01:08:28,932
Is the pin out?!

1122
01:08:29,023 --> 01:08:30,979
No, the pin's still in,
but it's attached to a wire.

1123
01:08:31,063 --> 01:08:32,212
Yeah.

1124
01:08:32,303 --> 01:08:34,976
Tie the spoon to the grenade.

1125
01:08:35,063 --> 01:08:35,973
Spoon? What?

1126
01:08:36,063 --> 01:08:37,382
With a string.

1127
01:08:37,463 --> 01:08:38,782
Oh, baby, don't say grenade.

1128
01:08:38,863 --> 01:08:39,739
OK. A string.

1129
01:08:39,823 --> 01:08:41,814
Uh...

1130
01:08:41,903 --> 01:08:44,212
...your shoelace! Come on.

1131
01:08:44,303 --> 01:08:45,702
I got it.

1132
01:08:45,783 --> 01:08:46,613
That's it.

1133
01:08:46,703 --> 01:08:47,772
OK, all right.

1134
01:08:47,863 --> 01:08:48,739
OK.

1135
01:08:48,823 --> 01:08:51,018
OK, be real careful.

1136
01:08:54,383 --> 01:08:56,214
All right. Here it goes.

1137
01:08:56,303 --> 01:08:57,179
Uh...

1138
01:08:57,263 --> 01:08:58,616
...you gotta hurry up.

1139
01:08:58,703 --> 01:09:01,820
- OK, OK.
- (glass smashes)

1140
01:09:03,383 --> 01:09:04,532
Got it. Got it.

1141
01:09:04,623 --> 01:09:05,817
Got it. What now?

1142
01:09:05,903 --> 01:09:07,302
Pull the pin out...

1143
01:09:07,383 --> 01:09:08,975
...and remove the grenade.

1144
01:09:13,423 --> 01:09:15,891
Um, uh...

1145
01:09:15,983 --> 01:09:17,382
You pull out the pin...

1146
01:09:17,463 --> 01:09:19,738
...and I will pull out the grenade.

1147
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:22,018
OK. Counting. One...

1148
01:09:22,103 --> 01:09:23,172
...two...

1149
01:09:23,263 --> 01:09:24,378
...three.

1150
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:27,773
- Whoa!
- Aagh!

1151
01:09:31,503 --> 01:09:32,379
Where is it?

1152
01:09:32,463 --> 01:09:34,374
Where is it? Where is it?!

1153
01:09:34,463 --> 01:09:35,782
It's in your hand.

1154
01:09:35,863 --> 01:09:38,013
Huh?! Take it out. Take it out!

1155
01:09:38,103 --> 01:09:40,378
Take it out. Take it out. Got it? Take it.

1156
01:09:40,463 --> 01:09:41,532
I got it.

1157
01:09:41,623 --> 01:09:42,692
OK, got it?

1158
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,774
Alex!

1159
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:48,293
Uh, you can open the door now.

1160
01:09:48,383 --> 01:09:50,453
OK.

1161
01:09:55,783 --> 01:09:57,694
(beeping)

1162
01:10:03,463 --> 01:10:05,260
No.

1163
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:28,174
Here's some more dry towels.

1164
01:10:28,263 --> 01:10:29,901
Thank you.

1165
01:10:29,983 --> 01:10:32,417
I am so sorry I yelled at you.

1166
01:10:32,503 --> 01:10:33,902
That's OK, Dad.

1167
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,621
I'm OK.

1168
01:10:38,983 --> 01:10:41,099
OK.

1169
01:10:41,183 --> 01:10:43,902
Where's Alex?

1170
01:10:43,983 --> 01:10:45,416
"Where's Alex?"

1171
01:10:47,303 --> 01:10:49,180
(coughing)

1172
01:10:51,863 --> 01:10:53,262
Come over here.

1173
01:10:55,463 --> 01:10:57,419
Just sit down. Don't talk. Don't move.

1174
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,733
- I'm OK.
- You're not OK.

1175
01:10:59,823 --> 01:11:01,381
Stop saying that, all right?

1176
01:11:01,463 --> 01:11:02,896
Are you OK?

1177
01:11:07,823 --> 01:11:09,097
I don't think so.

1178
01:11:09,183 --> 01:11:10,536
What?

1179
01:11:10,623 --> 01:11:11,976
He's adjusting starboard.

1180
01:11:12,063 --> 01:11:13,940
What does that mean?

1181
01:11:14,023 --> 01:11:16,378
Does that mean right, left,
round the island?

1182
01:11:16,463 --> 01:11:18,215
No. Right into the island.

1183
01:11:18,303 --> 01:11:19,622
(Annie) We're moving again.

1184
01:11:19,703 --> 01:11:21,102
(Merced)
He's turning us half a degree starboard.

1185
01:11:21,183 --> 01:11:23,902
Come on, guys. We're getting closer.

1186
01:11:23,983 --> 01:11:27,578
OK, I'm cutting the serial port connection.

1187
01:11:27,663 --> 01:11:29,540
Anything?

1188
01:11:30,863 --> 01:11:33,172
No, we're still locked out.

1189
01:11:33,263 --> 01:11:35,060
Come on.

1190
01:11:36,063 --> 01:11:37,974
Hey, we're moving.

1191
01:11:38,063 --> 01:11:39,496
We have control again.

1192
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:41,699
No, we're still dead here.

1193
01:11:41,783 --> 01:11:43,501
Are you sure, sir, because we're turning.

1194
01:11:43,583 --> 01:11:44,379
It's him.

1195
01:11:44,463 --> 01:11:45,976
It's him, it's him.

1196
01:11:46,063 --> 01:11:47,496
He's onboard. Geiger's still onboard.

1197
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:49,380
Guys, maybe these people can help.

1198
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:52,497
(Juliano) Hand me those.

1199
01:11:52,583 --> 01:11:54,380
Right there.

1200
01:11:58,503 --> 01:12:01,097
He's taking us right into an oil tanker.

1201
01:12:02,063 --> 01:12:03,178
What?

1202
01:12:03,263 --> 01:12:04,491
You're right.

1203
01:12:04,583 --> 01:12:06,938
She's anchored 16 miles out...

1204
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:09,378
...and we are doing 17.8 knots.

1205
01:12:09,463 --> 01:12:10,942
Well, how long till they move?

1206
01:12:11,023 --> 01:12:13,412
From starting their engines, 30 minutes.

1207
01:12:13,503 --> 01:12:16,222
They won't get out of our way in time.

1208
01:12:16,303 --> 01:12:19,101
So, what... what... what does that mean?

1209
01:12:19,183 --> 01:12:20,218
(sighs)

1210
01:12:20,303 --> 01:12:22,134
Oh, man!

1211
01:12:22,223 --> 01:12:24,612
Uh, he's turning us another quarter.

1212
01:12:30,663 --> 01:12:32,972
Agh! Damn it.

1213
01:12:35,463 --> 01:12:37,021
Can we turn the ship without the rudder?

1214
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:38,980
(Merced) The bow thrusters would do it.

1215
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:40,337
We can't get there now.

1216
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:42,095
You guys flooded the access.

1217
01:12:42,183 --> 01:12:43,821
We also messed up his programme, sir.

1218
01:12:43,903 --> 01:12:45,894
No, you almost sunk us.

1219
01:12:45,983 --> 01:12:47,894
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

1220
01:12:47,983 --> 01:12:50,292
Let's take a wrench
and dump it into the engine...

1221
01:12:50,383 --> 01:12:52,180
...and bust the transmission like a car...

1222
01:12:52,263 --> 01:12:53,742
...cos I've done that.

1223
01:12:53,823 --> 01:12:55,939
With all due respect, this is not your car.

1224
01:12:56,023 --> 01:12:57,297
This is a cruise liner.

1225
01:12:57,383 --> 01:12:58,293
She's right. It's a propeller.

1226
01:12:58,383 --> 01:12:59,816
We got to stop the propeller.

1227
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:02,212
You could wedge something into it...

1228
01:13:02,303 --> 01:13:04,180
...like a... a steel cable.

1229
01:13:04,263 --> 01:13:06,379
This is not my suggestion, obviously.

1230
01:13:06,463 --> 01:13:08,579
Great idea. I'll go under the ship.

1231
01:13:08,663 --> 01:13:09,698
No, you won't.

1232
01:13:09,783 --> 01:13:11,819
No, you won't. That's not what I meant.

1233
01:13:11,903 --> 01:13:12,892
That's a stupid idea.

1234
01:13:12,983 --> 01:13:14,211
No, it's a great idea.

1235
01:13:14,303 --> 01:13:15,179
No.

1236
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,379
It's suicide.
These blades are 12 feet across.

1237
01:13:17,463 --> 01:13:19,897
They'll suck you in and kill you.

1238
01:13:35,423 --> 01:13:37,220
Hey. Hey, Dino, I got one for you.

1239
01:13:37,303 --> 01:13:39,578
OK, who played the German captain...

1240
01:13:39,663 --> 01:13:40,982
...in The Enemy Below?

1241
01:13:41,063 --> 01:13:42,974
Curt Jurgens.

1242
01:13:51,263 --> 01:13:53,094
Down the next stairwell on the left...

1243
01:13:53,183 --> 01:13:54,980
...straight to the bowels of the ship.

1244
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:56,860
Bowels. That doesn't sound very good.

1245
01:13:58,463 --> 01:13:59,782
How much time left?

1246
01:13:59,863 --> 01:14:01,854
Not very much. We better hurry.

1247
01:14:02,903 --> 01:14:03,779
Mayday, Mayday.

1248
01:14:03,863 --> 01:14:05,216
This is Seabourn Legend...

1249
01:14:05,303 --> 01:14:07,419
...bearing 80 degrees east-northeast.

1250
01:14:07,503 --> 01:14:09,812
Engine and steering control nonfunctional.

1251
01:14:09,903 --> 01:14:11,302
I repeat. Nonfunctional.

1252
01:14:11,383 --> 01:14:12,736
Where are we going?

1253
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:13,812
Eindhoven Lion.

1254
01:14:13,903 --> 01:14:15,575
Eindhoven Lion, come in.

1255
01:14:15,663 --> 01:14:17,301
This is Seabourn Legend.

1256
01:14:17,383 --> 01:14:19,499
Eindhoven Lion, come in.

1257
01:14:19,583 --> 01:14:21,175
Eindhoven Lion, this is Seabourn Legend.

1258
01:14:21,263 --> 01:14:23,572
Come in, Eindhoven Lion.

1259
01:14:26,703 --> 01:14:28,500
This is the only way out.

1260
01:14:29,983 --> 01:14:31,416
This all the diving gear?

1261
01:14:31,503 --> 01:14:32,572
Yeah.

1262
01:14:32,663 --> 01:14:34,255
OK, here it goes.

1263
01:14:53,423 --> 01:14:55,379
(beeping)

1264
01:14:55,463 --> 01:14:56,452
Huh?

1265
01:15:03,663 --> 01:15:05,619
You think that ship's gonna rescue us?

1266
01:15:05,703 --> 01:15:06,692
What else could it be?

1267
01:15:06,783 --> 01:15:08,899
Alex, maybe this isn't such a hot idea.

1268
01:15:08,983 --> 01:15:11,213
Maybe you should just
leave the propeller alone, huh?

1269
01:15:11,303 --> 01:15:13,021
We have to stop the ship.

1270
01:15:14,383 --> 01:15:15,702
There's not much time left.

1271
01:15:18,383 --> 01:15:19,782
Are you sure this is gonna hold?

1272
01:15:19,863 --> 01:15:22,331
Yeah. We use those lines all over the ship.

1273
01:15:22,423 --> 01:15:23,902
He's not going all over the ship.

1274
01:15:23,983 --> 01:15:26,099
He's going under the ship, all right?

1275
01:15:26,183 --> 01:15:28,299
Annie, Annie. It's OK. It'll hold.

1276
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:38,577
Hold on. Let me lock it.

1277
01:15:38,663 --> 01:15:39,891
All right.

1278
01:15:39,983 --> 01:15:41,575
Hey.

1279
01:15:48,303 --> 01:15:49,975
(oxygen hisses)

1280
01:15:50,063 --> 01:15:51,337
Annie.

1281
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:53,095
What?

1282
01:15:53,183 --> 01:15:54,536
4296...

1283
01:15:54,623 --> 01:15:56,102
...589J.

1284
01:15:56,183 --> 01:15:58,219
I don't know what that is. What is that?

1285
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:00,180
It's my badge number.

1286
01:16:00,263 --> 01:16:02,618
It's 4296589J.

1287
01:16:03,583 --> 01:16:05,380
Thank you.

1288
01:16:05,463 --> 01:16:07,260
I'll be right back.

1289
01:16:11,383 --> 01:16:12,736
Here's the guideline.

1290
01:16:12,823 --> 01:16:16,577
Feed it into the propeller,
and it will pull the heavy cable in.

1291
01:16:22,063 --> 01:16:23,178
Not too much slack.

1292
01:16:23,263 --> 01:16:24,378
OK, OK, OK. I've got him.

1293
01:16:37,663 --> 01:16:38,812
He's getting too close.

1294
01:16:38,903 --> 01:16:40,894
OK, OK, he's close enough.

1295
01:16:40,983 --> 01:16:42,302
Stop it now.

1296
01:16:52,903 --> 01:16:55,212
Come on, baby. Let it go.

1297
01:16:55,303 --> 01:16:56,452
Let it go.

1298
01:17:05,903 --> 01:17:08,895
It's taking the cable.
It's working. It's working!

1299
01:17:08,983 --> 01:17:11,133
Well, then let's get him up then, huh?

1300
01:17:11,223 --> 01:17:13,179
- Come on.
- Pull him back up.

1301
01:17:28,783 --> 01:17:29,613
It's stuck.

1302
01:17:29,703 --> 01:17:30,692
He's snagged.

1303
01:17:30,783 --> 01:17:32,978
The lines are crossed.
We have to bring him up.

1304
01:17:33,063 --> 01:17:35,019
Come on. Now. Do something!

1305
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,821
(grunting)

1306
01:17:39,223 --> 01:17:40,099
It's sucking him in.

1307
01:17:40,183 --> 01:17:41,377
We gotta get him out of there!

1308
01:17:50,983 --> 01:17:52,780
(ship creaking)

1309
01:17:52,863 --> 01:17:53,852
18.

1310
01:17:55,463 --> 01:17:57,181
Come on, baby.

1311
01:17:57,263 --> 01:17:58,412
17.5.

1312
01:17:58,503 --> 01:17:59,902
They're doing it.

1313
01:17:59,983 --> 01:18:01,462
They're slowing us down.

1314
01:18:03,183 --> 01:18:04,411
(beeping)

1315
01:18:18,823 --> 01:18:20,859
Oh, no, you don't.

1316
01:18:29,703 --> 01:18:30,738
(grunting)

1317
01:18:30,823 --> 01:18:32,097
We gotta get him up.

1318
01:18:32,183 --> 01:18:35,334
(Juliano) Come on, come on. Keep pulling.

1319
01:18:35,423 --> 01:18:37,778
Pull.

1320
01:18:39,983 --> 01:18:41,211
(Juliano) Pull him up.

1321
01:18:41,303 --> 01:18:42,782
Keep pulling.

1322
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,576
What the hell's happening?

1323
01:18:45,663 --> 01:18:46,618
It's stuck again!

1324
01:18:46,703 --> 01:18:48,500
Get him up! Get him up!

1325
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:49,982
It's not gonna hold.

1326
01:18:55,303 --> 01:18:57,180
Oh! Won't go any faster.

1327
01:18:57,263 --> 01:18:59,174
Won't go any faster!

1328
01:19:04,023 --> 01:19:05,297
(Juliano) Watch out!

1329
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:10,653
Get back! Aagh!

1330
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:25,375
- I think I broke my arm.
- Alex! Alex!

1331
01:19:25,463 --> 01:19:26,691
Alex.

1332
01:19:26,783 --> 01:19:28,739
Come on. Hold on.

1333
01:19:28,823 --> 01:19:30,176
Come on. Hold on.

1334
01:19:30,263 --> 01:19:31,616
We've got him now.

1335
01:19:31,703 --> 01:19:33,534
(Annie) Are you all right?

1336
01:19:33,623 --> 01:19:35,420
What happened?

1337
01:19:35,503 --> 01:19:37,095
I don't know, something just...

1338
01:19:37,183 --> 01:19:38,821
Let him go.

1339
01:19:38,903 --> 01:19:40,894
You slowed her down...

1340
01:19:40,983 --> 01:19:43,292
...but you're not gonna stop her.

1341
01:19:43,383 --> 01:19:47,342
Annie, I don't think your boyfriend
appreciates the logistics involved...

1342
01:19:47,423 --> 01:19:49,812
...in ramming
the most automated ship in the world...

1343
01:19:49,903 --> 01:19:52,701
...into a loaded fuel tanker
with no set anchor path.

1344
01:19:52,783 --> 01:19:54,182
Let her go.

1345
01:19:54,263 --> 01:19:58,142
Maybe you can spend
the rest of your days in a mental hospital...

1346
01:19:58,223 --> 01:19:59,781
...sticking leeches to your ass.

1347
01:19:59,863 --> 01:20:02,172
Oh, so you met my nurses.

1348
01:20:02,263 --> 01:20:04,094
They clean the copper out of my blood.

1349
01:20:04,183 --> 01:20:07,095
Doctors gave me a couple of years to live!

1350
01:20:07,183 --> 01:20:09,333
Those bloodsuckers
might give me a few more.

1351
01:20:09,423 --> 01:20:11,891
You walk away now...

1352
01:20:11,983 --> 01:20:13,780
...and there's a chance I might not kill you.

1353
01:20:13,863 --> 01:20:15,740
Listen to you.

1354
01:20:15,823 --> 01:20:17,336
Let him go.

1355
01:20:17,423 --> 01:20:18,697
Now!

1356
01:20:18,783 --> 01:20:20,375
Go ahead.

1357
01:20:20,463 --> 01:20:21,498
Uh-uh.

1358
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:22,777
Now!

1359
01:20:22,863 --> 01:20:24,091
Go ahead.

1360
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:27,296
Oh.

1361
01:20:27,383 --> 01:20:28,372
Oh!

1362
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:34,096
Mr Juliano...

1363
01:20:34,183 --> 01:20:35,298
...we'll be getting off.

1364
01:20:35,383 --> 01:20:36,577
I hope you don't mind...

1365
01:20:36,663 --> 01:20:37,982
...but I'll be taking Annie with me...

1366
01:20:38,063 --> 01:20:40,623
...as a little extra insurance.

1367
01:20:40,703 --> 01:20:43,501
You know the one-armed freestyle,
don't you?

1368
01:20:49,183 --> 01:20:52,380
(Geiger)
Hey! Come on, or you'll join them!

1369
01:20:52,463 --> 01:20:53,498
This way.

1370
01:21:08,983 --> 01:21:10,860
(gasping)

1371
01:21:12,503 --> 01:21:13,572
Hold on, hold on.

1372
01:21:19,303 --> 01:21:21,214
(alarm buzzing)

1373
01:21:21,303 --> 01:21:23,692
I can't believe they can't see us.

1374
01:21:23,783 --> 01:21:25,455
How can they miss us?

1375
01:21:28,063 --> 01:21:29,416
I can't get her on the radio!

1376
01:21:29,503 --> 01:21:30,618
She's not responding.

1377
01:21:30,703 --> 01:21:32,534
She's closing in at 14 knots...

1378
01:21:32,623 --> 01:21:34,932
...bearing 166.4.

1379
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:36,502
She's heading straight into us.

1380
01:21:36,583 --> 01:21:38,016
Get the anchors up now!

1381
01:21:38,103 --> 01:21:38,979
(Man) Yes, sir!

1382
01:21:39,063 --> 01:21:40,576
(alarm)

1383
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:52,700
Which way did they go?

1384
01:21:52,783 --> 01:21:54,853
The marina. He's going to jump ship.

1385
01:21:56,663 --> 01:21:57,982
You all right?

1386
01:21:58,063 --> 01:22:00,133
I'm OK.

1387
01:22:00,223 --> 01:22:01,781
Hurry up!

1388
01:22:04,183 --> 01:22:05,980
(bell ringing)

1389
01:22:06,063 --> 01:22:07,735
Get moving!

1390
01:22:07,823 --> 01:22:10,383
Get off of me! Get off of me!

1391
01:22:10,463 --> 01:22:12,260
Very physical, aren't we?

1392
01:22:22,023 --> 01:22:23,775
OK...

1393
01:22:23,863 --> 01:22:25,376
...that way.

1394
01:22:25,463 --> 01:22:26,532
Down the stairs.

1395
01:22:26,623 --> 01:22:27,578
Hold it!

1396
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:36,141
We're going for a little ride.

1397
01:22:36,223 --> 01:22:37,576
Come on.

1398
01:22:37,663 --> 01:22:39,733
Can't let you go now.
You're my little hostage.

1399
01:22:39,823 --> 01:22:40,699
Come on!

1400
01:22:40,783 --> 01:22:42,136
Don't touch me!

1401
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:45,056
Get down. Get down!

1402
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:49,891
All right.

1403
01:22:49,983 --> 01:22:51,462
That's it.

1404
01:22:53,063 --> 01:22:54,098
So...

1405
01:22:54,183 --> 01:22:55,252
...aw.

1406
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:58,140
How do you like your vacation so far?

1407
01:22:58,223 --> 01:22:59,099
Sit down!

1408
01:22:59,183 --> 01:23:00,377
Ow.

1409
01:23:13,303 --> 01:23:15,214
You better hang on.

1410
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:23,173
Annie!

1411
01:23:23,263 --> 01:23:25,982
Alex? Alex!

1412
01:23:29,823 --> 01:23:31,381
Need a hand?

1413
01:23:31,463 --> 01:23:32,612
Hold on. I got you.

1414
01:23:43,063 --> 01:23:47,659
I don't think
you want to be on that ship now, Annie.

1415
01:23:50,863 --> 01:23:52,091
Aagh!

1416
01:23:53,863 --> 01:23:54,773
You know your way around the ship?

1417
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:55,773
Yeah.

1418
01:24:06,383 --> 01:24:07,372
You're OK?

1419
01:24:07,463 --> 01:24:08,976
What happened?

1420
01:24:10,103 --> 01:24:12,059
Alex, can you hear me?

1421
01:24:17,263 --> 01:24:18,821
I don't like this at all.

1422
01:24:18,903 --> 01:24:19,779
Oh, my God.

1423
01:24:19,863 --> 01:24:20,978
Jeez, we're coming in too fast!

1424
01:24:21,063 --> 01:24:24,851
How could this happen on our honeymoon?

1425
01:24:28,423 --> 01:24:30,300
Wait a minute.

1426
01:24:30,383 --> 01:24:32,817
Oh, my God. Why don't we stop?

1427
01:24:32,903 --> 01:24:34,302
Why don't we stop?

1428
01:24:34,383 --> 01:24:35,782
Everyone, move away from the windows!

1429
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:36,818
Away from the windows!

1430
01:24:38,503 --> 01:24:39,982
(man) Brace yourself for the crash.

1431
01:24:49,623 --> 01:24:51,454
(alarm blaring)

1432
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:53,737
How long before we have power?

1433
01:24:53,823 --> 01:24:55,734
Seven or eight minutes, sir.

1434
01:24:55,823 --> 01:24:57,893
In eight minutes
we'll be blown out of the water!

1435
01:24:57,983 --> 01:24:59,939
Speed the engines full power.

1436
01:25:00,023 --> 01:25:02,412
(man) Prepare for hard forward turn.

1437
01:25:07,703 --> 01:25:10,661
Alex,
if you can hear me, use the ship's intercom.

1438
01:25:13,383 --> 01:25:15,021
Left, Alex, go to the left.

1439
01:25:15,103 --> 01:25:16,502
(Juliano) Alex, can you hear me?

1440
01:25:16,583 --> 01:25:18,175
If you can hear me, use the ship's intercom.

1441
01:25:18,263 --> 01:25:20,299
I can hear you.

1442
01:25:20,383 --> 01:25:21,293
We're running out of time.

1443
01:25:21,383 --> 01:25:22,213
All right, look.

1444
01:25:22,303 --> 01:25:24,100
Which way to the bow thrusters?

1445
01:25:24,183 --> 01:25:25,901
You flooded it. There's no way to get there.

1446
01:25:25,983 --> 01:25:27,382
I can get there.

1447
01:25:27,463 --> 01:25:28,691
Just talk me through it.

1448
01:25:28,783 --> 01:25:32,901
OK. The bow thrusters are two large
wheels connected by a small shaft.

1449
01:25:32,983 --> 01:25:37,135
You can find them at the end of the shaft
below the bilge pump room.

1450
01:25:37,223 --> 01:25:38,178
The bilge pump room.

1451
01:25:38,263 --> 01:25:39,139
Do you copy?

1452
01:25:39,223 --> 01:25:40,895
Yeah, copy that.

1453
01:25:40,983 --> 01:25:42,336
Look, stay with us.

1454
01:25:42,423 --> 01:25:46,018
You talk us through it,
I'll follow your voice.

1455
01:25:46,103 --> 01:25:49,982
(Juliano) OK, you're in section BT-1.

1456
01:25:50,063 --> 01:25:52,372
At the end of the hallway is a hatch.

1457
01:25:52,463 --> 01:25:54,693
That'll bring you into the bilge pump room.

1458
01:25:54,783 --> 01:25:55,977
Hatch. Hatch.

1459
01:25:56,063 --> 01:25:59,339
It's at the same level as where you are,
so there must be some air.

1460
01:25:59,423 --> 01:26:00,378
Have you got it?

1461
01:26:02,663 --> 01:26:03,891
You're going to have to lose the vest.

1462
01:26:03,983 --> 01:26:05,701
What do you mean, lose my vest?

1463
01:26:05,783 --> 01:26:07,262
We're going under.

1464
01:26:09,423 --> 01:26:11,061
Damn, man.

1465
01:26:25,663 --> 01:26:27,574
(horn blows)

1466
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:30,414
Let's get the hell out of here!

1467
01:26:30,503 --> 01:26:32,414
(man) Move away from the railing!

1468
01:26:32,503 --> 01:26:34,175
(woman) Harvey, wait for me!

1469
01:26:34,263 --> 01:26:35,776
Come on, over against the wall!

1470
01:26:35,863 --> 01:26:37,933
What's going on?

1471
01:26:38,023 --> 01:26:40,776
(Juliano) At the far side is a short slide.

1472
01:26:40,863 --> 01:26:43,696
That will lead into the bow thruster room.

1473
01:26:43,783 --> 01:26:45,375
Alex, can you hear me?

1474
01:26:45,463 --> 01:26:47,454
We're getting very close.

1475
01:26:55,063 --> 01:26:56,974
(horn blows)

1476
01:27:00,823 --> 01:27:03,496
(Juliano) The bow thrusters,
they're two large wheels...

1477
01:27:03,583 --> 01:27:05,699
...connected to a shaft...

1478
01:27:05,783 --> 01:27:07,057
...that will turn the propeller.

1479
01:27:19,383 --> 01:27:20,941
Now, when you find the wheel...

1480
01:27:21,023 --> 01:27:23,173
...turn it as fast you can.

1481
01:27:23,263 --> 01:27:24,776
Hold on, hold on.

1482
01:27:24,863 --> 01:27:26,774
You only turn one wheel at a time.

1483
01:27:26,863 --> 01:27:29,980
If you turn them both,
you'll cancel yourself out.

1484
01:27:30,063 --> 01:27:32,497
Make sure
you turn the starboard wheel only.

1485
01:27:32,583 --> 01:27:34,539
OK, look.

1486
01:27:34,623 --> 01:27:36,181
We have to play tag.

1487
01:27:36,263 --> 01:27:37,491
I'll go down first.

1488
01:27:37,583 --> 01:27:38,902
You follow me in 15 seconds.

1489
01:27:38,983 --> 01:27:40,382
All right.

1490
01:28:10,583 --> 01:28:14,098
They're turning us. Sir, they're turning us.

1491
01:28:14,183 --> 01:28:15,093
Yes.

1492
01:28:15,183 --> 01:28:16,582
Yes, it's working.

1493
01:28:22,383 --> 01:28:24,260
(gasps)

1494
01:28:38,543 --> 01:28:40,261
(horn blows)

1495
01:28:50,503 --> 01:28:52,414
(horn blows)

1496
01:28:54,783 --> 01:28:56,660
No, no, no, no.

1497
01:28:58,503 --> 01:29:00,619
(woman) Make it stop.

1498
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:16,493
(horn blows)

1499
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:17,811
Oh, my God! Everybody down!

1500
01:29:18,783 --> 01:29:20,580
We're going to crash!

1501
01:29:25,783 --> 01:29:27,660
(screaming)

1502
01:29:33,863 --> 01:29:36,502
(screaming)

1503
01:29:40,823 --> 01:29:42,973
Oh, God!

1504
01:29:47,183 --> 01:29:48,298
Aagh!

1505
01:30:02,423 --> 01:30:04,300
(screaming)

1506
01:30:07,223 --> 01:30:08,099
I think we did it!

1507
01:30:08,183 --> 01:30:09,662
We turned it!

1508
01:30:15,263 --> 01:30:16,582
Get down!

1509
01:30:16,663 --> 01:30:17,652
Aagh!

1510
01:30:29,823 --> 01:30:32,383
Whoa! (laughs)

1511
01:30:32,463 --> 01:30:34,738
I do believe we have a miss!

1512
01:30:34,823 --> 01:30:36,017
(computer beeps)

1513
01:30:36,103 --> 01:30:38,219
Impossible! No!

1514
01:30:38,303 --> 01:30:39,258
No!

1515
01:30:45,063 --> 01:30:46,496
They did it.

1516
01:30:46,583 --> 01:30:47,698
Oh!

1517
01:30:51,503 --> 01:30:52,572
Oh, we made it.

1518
01:30:52,663 --> 01:30:54,415
Oh, Jack.

1519
01:31:01,223 --> 01:31:02,941
Yes. Yes.

1520
01:31:04,063 --> 01:31:05,098
I sure hope somebody got that on tape.

1521
01:31:05,183 --> 01:31:06,093
Yeah.

1522
01:31:07,183 --> 01:31:08,059
Oh!

1523
01:31:23,863 --> 01:31:24,898
Oh, shit.

1524
01:31:25,903 --> 01:31:27,052
Oh, shit!

1525
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:30,982
Oh, shit.

1526
01:31:33,303 --> 01:31:34,782
Aw, shit.

1527
01:31:34,863 --> 01:31:36,012
Mum.

1528
01:31:48,023 --> 01:31:49,012
Hey!

1529
01:31:50,063 --> 01:31:51,781
Hey!

1530
01:32:02,463 --> 01:32:04,101
We got to get out of here.

1531
01:32:04,183 --> 01:32:05,502
(Dante) Yeah, no kidding. Come on.

1532
01:32:05,583 --> 01:32:06,982
Come on!

1533
01:32:08,783 --> 01:32:11,297
Come on, hurry up!
They're coming right at us!

1534
01:32:11,383 --> 01:32:13,897
Come on! Faster than that!

1535
01:32:13,983 --> 01:32:15,382
(man) We have right of way here!

1536
01:32:15,463 --> 01:32:17,977
Sorry! Excuse us!

1537
01:32:18,063 --> 01:32:19,291
No way!

1538
01:32:20,583 --> 01:32:22,221
That was close!

1539
01:32:24,863 --> 01:32:26,376
To the bridge!

1540
01:32:27,783 --> 01:32:29,501
(alarm beeping)

1541
01:32:29,583 --> 01:32:30,493
Where's anchor control?

1542
01:32:30,583 --> 01:32:31,493
We got to stop her.

1543
01:32:31,583 --> 01:32:32,698
What? Anchor control?

1544
01:32:32,783 --> 01:32:34,978
We can't drop it. We're moving too fast.

1545
01:32:35,063 --> 01:32:35,893
Did you see Annie?

1546
01:32:35,983 --> 01:32:36,893
No.

1547
01:32:36,983 --> 01:32:38,132
(Merced) I got it! I got it.

1548
01:32:38,223 --> 01:32:40,578
(Juliano)
No. No anchor can stop a moving ship.

1549
01:32:42,263 --> 01:32:45,175
(Merced) It's moving. It's going down.

1550
01:33:04,783 --> 01:33:06,296
I can feel it. We're slowing down.

1551
01:33:06,383 --> 01:33:08,260
(Juliano)
No. Too fast. It's not going to hold.

1552
01:33:12,183 --> 01:33:13,093
(woman) Harvey!

1553
01:33:13,183 --> 01:33:14,536
(man) Get in the corner! Brace yourselves!

1554
01:33:14,623 --> 01:33:16,454
Oh, my God! We're doomed!

1555
01:33:21,063 --> 01:33:23,702
We're not going to stop!
We're not going to stop!

1556
01:33:23,783 --> 01:33:25,660
(alarm beeping)

1557
01:33:27,583 --> 01:33:28,413
Drop the other one.

1558
01:33:28,503 --> 01:33:31,859
I'm telling you. We're still too fast.

1559
01:33:35,783 --> 01:33:37,182
It's stuck.

1560
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:44,933
- God, no. No.
- (bangs console)

1561
01:33:45,023 --> 01:33:46,695
Where's the horn? Where's the horn?

1562
01:33:46,783 --> 01:33:48,694
How can there not be a horn?

1563
01:33:48,783 --> 01:33:51,092
There's got to be a horn here somewhere.

1564
01:33:58,583 --> 01:33:59,618
Where's he going?

1565
01:34:00,983 --> 01:34:01,893
Oh, shit!

1566
01:34:09,223 --> 01:34:10,702
(Merced) What you doing with the wheel?

1567
01:34:10,783 --> 01:34:11,977
Huh?

1568
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:14,099
It doesn't work!

1569
01:34:14,183 --> 01:34:15,138
What?

1570
01:34:15,223 --> 01:34:18,215
Jan, hold this a sec.

1571
01:34:19,463 --> 01:34:20,498
(gasps)

1572
01:34:20,583 --> 01:34:21,572
Allez! Allez!

1573
01:34:21,663 --> 01:34:23,062
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1574
01:34:27,263 --> 01:34:28,218
Aagh!

1575
01:34:32,823 --> 01:34:35,132
(screaming)

1576
01:34:35,223 --> 01:34:36,702
(Merced) I can't believe it.

1577
01:34:36,783 --> 01:34:37,738
This is slowing us down.

1578
01:34:37,823 --> 01:34:40,018
Nine knots.

1579
01:34:40,103 --> 01:34:41,695
Jeez!

1580
01:34:41,783 --> 01:34:43,296
Oh, man! Let's go!

1581
01:34:43,383 --> 01:34:44,372
Huh?

1582
01:34:45,703 --> 01:34:47,455
This isn't happening.

1583
01:34:50,623 --> 01:34:52,500
Oh, no. No more. Not again.

1584
01:34:52,583 --> 01:34:55,381
I found it! I found it! I found it!

1585
01:34:55,463 --> 01:34:56,816
(PA beeps)

1586
01:34:56,903 --> 01:34:59,497
Everybody get out of the way!
There's a big boat coming!

1587
01:34:59,583 --> 01:35:00,493
Please!

1588
01:35:00,583 --> 01:35:01,413
Now!

1589
01:35:01,503 --> 01:35:02,697
Run! Jump!

1590
01:35:02,783 --> 01:35:03,613
Swim!

1591
01:35:03,703 --> 01:35:04,738
Come on, people, move out of the way!

1592
01:35:04,823 --> 01:35:06,893
We don't have brakes!

1593
01:35:06,983 --> 01:35:08,177
This is not a dream!

1594
01:35:08,263 --> 01:35:09,252
Jump!

1595
01:35:10,983 --> 01:35:12,621
Abandon your ship!

1596
01:35:21,063 --> 01:35:23,179
Oh, my God! We're mowing them down!

1597
01:35:26,623 --> 01:35:27,942
Stop!

1598
01:35:28,023 --> 01:35:29,138
(Merced) it... it's helping.

1599
01:35:29,223 --> 01:35:30,975
Seven knots.

1600
01:35:47,063 --> 01:35:48,212
Turn right! Turn right!

1601
01:35:51,623 --> 01:35:53,215
Look out!

1602
01:35:58,183 --> 01:36:00,492
Whoa!

1603
01:36:00,583 --> 01:36:01,857
Shit!

1604
01:36:08,263 --> 01:36:10,174
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

1605
01:36:18,183 --> 01:36:21,892
(man)
Two bedrooms, dining room, kitchen, nook.

1606
01:36:21,983 --> 01:36:23,701
Mummy, there's a big boat.

1607
01:36:23,783 --> 01:36:26,297
I know.
There are a lot of big boats here, honey.

1608
01:36:26,383 --> 01:36:27,577
What a cute boy...

1609
01:36:27,663 --> 01:36:29,972
...and smart of you to notice all the ships.

1610
01:36:30,063 --> 01:36:33,055
The walls are a soft European eggshell...

1611
01:36:34,983 --> 01:36:36,655
(Juliano) God, it'll take forever to stop us.

1612
01:36:39,463 --> 01:36:40,896
Harvey?

1613
01:36:40,983 --> 01:36:42,894
(screaming)

1614
01:36:45,383 --> 01:36:46,611
Quick!

1615
01:36:49,903 --> 01:36:51,302
We're not going to fit! It's too tight!

1616
01:36:52,423 --> 01:36:53,378
(barking)

1617
01:37:00,383 --> 01:37:01,338
Get down!

1618
01:37:01,423 --> 01:37:02,617
Aagh!

1619
01:37:18,183 --> 01:37:20,014
(screaming)

1620
01:37:21,383 --> 01:37:23,294
Six knots!

1621
01:37:33,863 --> 01:37:36,980
Aagh!

1622
01:37:41,263 --> 01:37:42,093
Aagh!

1623
01:37:42,183 --> 01:37:43,980
Oooh!

1624
01:37:45,703 --> 01:37:48,581
What? What? I can't hear you.

1625
01:37:51,983 --> 01:37:53,098
Aagh!

1626
01:37:56,983 --> 01:37:59,053
It's coming.

1627
01:38:07,583 --> 01:38:09,301
Five knots!

1628
01:38:15,263 --> 01:38:16,776
(barking)

1629
01:38:22,183 --> 01:38:23,411
(both) Ooh!

1630
01:38:33,023 --> 01:38:34,376
(horn blares)

1631
01:38:36,263 --> 01:38:38,697
(horn blares)

1632
01:38:40,863 --> 01:38:42,137
Four...

1633
01:38:42,223 --> 01:38:43,451
...aagh!

1634
01:38:44,583 --> 01:38:45,493
Stop!

1635
01:38:53,263 --> 01:38:55,254
Here it comes now!

1636
01:38:58,023 --> 01:38:58,899
It's really big, Mum.

1637
01:38:58,983 --> 01:39:00,496
Oh, my God!

1638
01:39:01,863 --> 01:39:03,091
Oh, my God!

1639
01:39:07,263 --> 01:39:08,298
Get down!

1640
01:39:09,983 --> 01:39:11,780
Aagh!

1641
01:39:33,263 --> 01:39:35,174
Aagh!

1642
01:39:37,583 --> 01:39:39,141
Two knots!

1643
01:39:39,223 --> 01:39:40,656
Almost stopped!

1644
01:39:53,103 --> 01:39:54,058
(barking)

1645
01:39:57,703 --> 01:39:58,852
Oh, no!

1646
01:40:03,823 --> 01:40:05,461
Get down!

1647
01:40:08,263 --> 01:40:10,174
(rings)

1648
01:40:16,223 --> 01:40:17,178
Zero.

1649
01:40:51,983 --> 01:40:53,462
Aagh! Aagh! Ooh.

1650
01:40:56,623 --> 01:40:59,183
(car alarm)

1651
01:40:59,263 --> 01:41:01,299
My car!

1652
01:41:05,383 --> 01:41:06,941
(barks)

1653
01:41:07,023 --> 01:41:08,979
I got to find Annie.

1654
01:41:20,423 --> 01:41:22,175
(Juliano) Shit! She's going over!

1655
01:41:22,263 --> 01:41:24,299
(screaming)

1656
01:41:24,383 --> 01:41:25,896
(Dante) We're tipping!

1657
01:41:25,983 --> 01:41:26,893
We're tipping!

1658
01:41:26,983 --> 01:41:28,462
(screaming)

1659
01:41:40,663 --> 01:41:42,176
Ow.

1660
01:41:46,863 --> 01:41:48,421
We're docked.

1661
01:41:49,583 --> 01:41:51,221
We're docked!

1662
01:41:51,303 --> 01:41:52,622
I can't believe it!

1663
01:41:52,703 --> 01:41:54,182
We're safe.

1664
01:42:06,983 --> 01:42:07,972
Zero.

1665
01:42:09,583 --> 01:42:11,460
(creaking)

1666
01:42:15,063 --> 01:42:17,054
(shouts)

1667
01:42:17,143 --> 01:42:18,462
Say what?

1668
01:42:18,543 --> 01:42:20,613
Bad luck to run ship over town.

1669
01:42:20,703 --> 01:42:22,295
No shit, bad luck, man.

1670
01:42:22,383 --> 01:42:24,897
I just bought a condo here.

1671
01:42:24,983 --> 01:42:27,099
My God.

1672
01:42:27,183 --> 01:42:29,014
You all right?

1673
01:42:29,103 --> 01:42:32,015
Yeah. I think I broke my other arm.

1674
01:42:32,103 --> 01:42:34,492
The ship's parked in the middle of town...

1675
01:42:34,583 --> 01:42:36,733
...but, hey, it could've been worse.

1676
01:42:36,823 --> 01:42:39,576
I'm not sure how,
but it could've been worse.

1677
01:42:39,663 --> 01:42:41,301
I got to get my girl.

1678
01:42:41,383 --> 01:42:42,293
Thank you.

1679
01:42:44,023 --> 01:42:45,092
Uh!

1680
01:42:45,183 --> 01:42:46,218
Sorry.

1681
01:42:47,183 --> 01:42:48,616
Be careful.

1682
01:42:49,583 --> 01:42:51,301
I'll go check on the others.

1683
01:43:03,623 --> 01:43:06,091
Looks like your vacation is almost over.

1684
01:43:06,183 --> 01:43:08,492
Just stay away from me,
or you're going to get hurt...

1685
01:43:08,583 --> 01:43:09,572
...I swear to God.

1686
01:43:09,663 --> 01:43:11,176
What are you going to do, Annie?

1687
01:43:11,263 --> 01:43:13,333
Splash water on me?

1688
01:43:22,783 --> 01:43:23,693
I'm driving now.

1689
01:43:23,783 --> 01:43:25,774
Hey, Annie! Hey!

1690
01:43:26,903 --> 01:43:28,495
Annie!

1691
01:43:28,583 --> 01:43:30,619
Come back! You stay with me!

1692
01:43:30,703 --> 01:43:32,295
You're my hostage!

1693
01:43:32,383 --> 01:43:34,180
I need a boat!

1694
01:43:37,103 --> 01:43:38,502
Can I help you?

1695
01:43:38,583 --> 01:43:40,938
I'm a cop. I need to borrow your boat.

1696
01:43:41,023 --> 01:43:43,139
What? You've got to be kidding me.

1697
01:43:43,223 --> 01:43:45,976
This is joke, right?
You're messing with my head.

1698
01:43:46,063 --> 01:43:47,860
Come on, man, you gotta be kidding me!

1699
01:43:48,983 --> 01:43:50,098
Can't you see I'm on a date?

1700
01:43:50,183 --> 01:43:53,573
Alex Shaw, LAPD. Start the boat.

1701
01:43:53,663 --> 01:43:54,937
LAPD? I'm in the Caribbean, man.

1702
01:43:55,023 --> 01:43:56,012
What are you doing here?

1703
01:43:57,063 --> 01:43:58,576
Stop him, Maurice.

1704
01:43:58,663 --> 01:44:00,938
Know how many hours of therapy
I've had because of you guys?

1705
01:44:01,023 --> 01:44:01,899
And that shit's expensive!

1706
01:44:01,983 --> 01:44:02,813
You drive.

1707
01:44:02,903 --> 01:44:04,302
(woman) Hey, hey, where are you going?

1708
01:44:04,383 --> 01:44:06,453
No!

1709
01:44:18,623 --> 01:44:20,181
Hey! Annie!

1710
01:44:30,263 --> 01:44:32,174
OK, OK, take it easy, man!

1711
01:44:32,263 --> 01:44:35,175
This boat cost me $150,000.

1712
01:44:38,903 --> 01:44:40,894
That way.

1713
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:43,178
(Maurice) OK. That's it!

1714
01:44:43,263 --> 01:44:46,141
I want a promissory note right now!

1715
01:44:46,223 --> 01:44:47,781
(woman) Whoa!

1716
01:45:02,903 --> 01:45:03,779
Give it!

1717
01:45:03,863 --> 01:45:05,899
Let go of me!

1718
01:45:05,983 --> 01:45:06,813
Ow!

1719
01:45:06,903 --> 01:45:08,700
Do we have a fiery temper?

1720
01:45:08,783 --> 01:45:10,182
You have no idea!

1721
01:45:10,263 --> 01:45:12,174
(Geiger) There she is.

1722
01:45:12,263 --> 01:45:14,060
Look! Fireworks!

1723
01:45:16,263 --> 01:45:17,173
It's her.

1724
01:45:17,263 --> 01:45:18,139
What?

1725
01:45:18,223 --> 01:45:19,099
That way, fast.

1726
01:45:19,183 --> 01:45:20,298
Nah, I can't drive that fast!

1727
01:45:20,383 --> 01:45:21,896
There's shallow reefs! Shit!

1728
01:45:25,423 --> 01:45:27,379
(starts engine)

1729
01:45:41,903 --> 01:45:43,814
Get as close to that plane as you can.

1730
01:45:43,903 --> 01:45:46,019
Give me one good reason.

1731
01:45:46,103 --> 01:45:48,378
If you don't, I'll throw you over.

1732
01:45:48,463 --> 01:45:49,498
OK.

1733
01:45:49,583 --> 01:45:50,982
That's a good reason.

1734
01:46:01,023 --> 01:46:02,934
Almost at speed!

1735
01:46:03,023 --> 01:46:04,342
Don't! Don't you...

1736
01:46:04,423 --> 01:46:06,334
Ow! Let me go!

1737
01:46:06,423 --> 01:46:09,301
I think you better stay with me.

1738
01:46:09,383 --> 01:46:10,532
Get closer!

1739
01:46:10,623 --> 01:46:11,976
What?

1740
01:46:23,263 --> 01:46:24,378
Let me go!

1741
01:46:24,463 --> 01:46:26,181
You want to go? I'll let you go...

1742
01:46:26,263 --> 01:46:28,493
...at about 10,000 feet!

1743
01:46:28,583 --> 01:46:30,380
Get me closer!

1744
01:46:32,783 --> 01:46:33,772
Huh?

1745
01:46:33,863 --> 01:46:35,057
He's going to shoot the plane!

1746
01:46:37,903 --> 01:46:39,541
Nice shot.

1747
01:46:41,983 --> 01:46:45,532
Let's see if he can hold on now!

1748
01:46:45,623 --> 01:46:47,295
Follow me!

1749
01:46:56,503 --> 01:46:58,095
Let go!

1750
01:46:58,183 --> 01:46:59,502
He... he's supposed to let go.

1751
01:46:59,583 --> 01:47:00,777
Let go!

1752
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:05,177
No, no, he's reeling himself in!

1753
01:47:05,263 --> 01:47:07,697
Follow him! Follow him!

1754
01:47:09,023 --> 01:47:11,696
Oh, you little shit.

1755
01:47:11,783 --> 01:47:13,774
Here we go!

1756
01:47:15,503 --> 01:47:16,902
(Geiger) No!

1757
01:47:16,983 --> 01:47:18,575
No, don't!

1758
01:47:18,663 --> 01:47:19,652
No!

1759
01:47:21,023 --> 01:47:22,979
Come here!

1760
01:47:23,063 --> 01:47:25,293
Oh, God.

1761
01:47:43,703 --> 01:47:45,819
Alex! Alex!

1762
01:47:45,903 --> 01:47:48,258
Annie!

1763
01:47:48,743 --> 01:47:50,256
Annie!

1764
01:48:02,223 --> 01:48:04,657
- Hi.
- (Annie) Hi.

1765
01:48:04,743 --> 01:48:05,812
Hi.

1766
01:48:06,463 --> 01:48:08,738
Come on.

1767
01:48:15,863 --> 01:48:16,978
Now hold on!

1768
01:48:18,783 --> 01:48:20,057
Aagh!

1769
01:48:23,703 --> 01:48:25,341
What's he riding that banana peel for?

1770
01:48:25,423 --> 01:48:26,492
What's he doing?

1771
01:48:29,263 --> 01:48:31,493
Aagh!

1772
01:48:50,503 --> 01:48:51,458
Aagh!

1773
01:48:54,263 --> 01:48:56,982
Aagh!

1774
01:48:59,183 --> 01:49:00,582
(siren)

1775
01:49:00,663 --> 01:49:01,937
(PA) Abandon ship.

1776
01:49:02,023 --> 01:49:03,615
All the crew members...

1777
01:49:03,703 --> 01:49:05,580
...abandon ship immediately.

1778
01:49:05,663 --> 01:49:07,733
(Maurice) It's gonna blow, it's gonna blow!

1779
01:49:07,823 --> 01:49:09,575
Jump, fool! Get off that thing!

1780
01:49:10,583 --> 01:49:11,459
Jump!

1781
01:49:40,663 --> 01:49:42,938
Hope they can hold their breath
a long time.

1782
01:49:43,023 --> 01:49:45,491
Come on, don't run out of air.

1783
01:49:45,583 --> 01:49:48,017
Me not see 'em. Me think they dead.

1784
01:49:48,103 --> 01:49:49,582
They're not gone.

1785
01:50:09,663 --> 01:50:12,700
(woman) There they are! There they are!

1786
01:50:12,783 --> 01:50:13,693
(Maurice) Hey, over here!

1787
01:50:13,783 --> 01:50:14,977
Hey, this way!

1788
01:50:30,263 --> 01:50:32,572
Here, come on. I got you. Come on.

1789
01:50:32,663 --> 01:50:33,698
Come on, hurry up.

1790
01:50:33,783 --> 01:50:35,102
Hurry up, come on. It's gonna blow.

1791
01:50:35,183 --> 01:50:36,980
Hurry up, it's gonna blow.

1792
01:50:41,103 --> 01:50:42,582
Aagh!

1793
01:51:02,063 --> 01:51:04,099
Untie 'em, untie 'em.

1794
01:51:04,183 --> 01:51:05,502
You're all right.

1795
01:51:07,383 --> 01:51:09,374
- You OK?
- Yeah.

1796
01:51:09,463 --> 01:51:11,772
I was just so scared. I was so scared.

1797
01:51:11,863 --> 01:51:15,219
I didn't think
I was gonna make it there for a second.

1798
01:51:18,783 --> 01:51:19,977
Thank you.

1799
01:51:24,503 --> 01:51:29,213
Look what I found in international waters.

1800
01:51:29,303 --> 01:51:31,373
This really is paradise.

1801
01:51:31,463 --> 01:51:33,499
I got something for you.

1802
01:51:39,183 --> 01:51:40,980
Oh.

1803
01:51:42,583 --> 01:51:43,413
Wow.

1804
01:51:43,503 --> 01:51:46,415
You want to wear this for a while?

1805
01:51:49,183 --> 01:51:52,300
How long were you thinking?

1806
01:51:52,383 --> 01:51:53,816
50 years.

1807
01:51:53,903 --> 01:51:54,858
Yeah?

1808
01:51:56,183 --> 01:51:57,377
Yeah.

1809
01:52:06,663 --> 01:52:09,416
Can I make all the travel plans
from now on?

1810
01:52:09,503 --> 01:52:10,697
Deal.

1811
01:52:43,863 --> 01:52:45,057
# Jimmy Cliff:
You Can Get It If You Really Want

1812
01:52:45,143 --> 01:52:47,737
# You can get it, if you really want

1813
01:52:48,183 --> 01:52:52,381
# You can get it, if you really want

1814
01:52:52,463 --> 01:52:55,182
# You can get it, if you really want

1815
01:52:55,263 --> 01:52:56,298
# But you must try...

1816
01:52:56,383 --> 01:52:57,338
Hello.

1817
01:52:57,423 --> 01:52:59,493
Mr Kenter.

1818
01:52:59,583 --> 01:53:00,538
Oh, Annie.

1819
01:53:00,623 --> 01:53:03,774
- Uh... Oh, you're back again.
- Yeah.

1820
01:53:03,863 --> 01:53:05,012
Hope you don't mind.

1821
01:53:05,103 --> 01:53:06,536
I kind of requested you.

1822
01:53:06,623 --> 01:53:09,740
I wanted to make up for last week.

1823
01:53:09,823 --> 01:53:11,017
Why would I mind?

1824
01:53:11,103 --> 01:53:14,015
Gosh, uh...
I'm sure it'll go much better today.

1825
01:53:14,103 --> 01:53:15,218
Oh, yeah, it will.

1826
01:53:15,303 --> 01:53:17,692
- Had some problems.
- Nervous, yeah, a little bit.

1827
01:53:17,783 --> 01:53:19,694
OK, Mr Kenter, here we go.

1828
01:53:32,823 --> 01:53:35,542
Sorry, but that bus was going way too fast.

1829
01:53:35,623 --> 01:53:38,342
I noticed that. Uh, make a left here.

1830
01:53:38,423 --> 01:53:39,538
Got it. Excuse me.

1831
01:53:39,623 --> 01:53:43,218
Thank you, thank you.

1832
01:53:43,303 --> 01:53:44,452

1833
01:53:44,543 --> 01:53:46,056
