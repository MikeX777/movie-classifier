1
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:41,537
Miss Spruance. Miss Spruance.

2
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:44,739
Would you like to show me where
it's marked “smearing“ here?

3
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:48,704
- Because, I swear, I don't see it.
- Sorry, I didn't know I was.

4
00:03:48,776 --> 00:03:50,992
Also, I'd be mildly
content if I could have a

5
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:53,085
little less delirious
self-appreciation...

6
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,087
and some small regard
for remaining somewhere

7
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,463
in the vicinity of
the goddamn note.

8
00:03:58,535 --> 00:04:01,088
- I wasn't smearing.
- Okay. Come on.

9
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,160
No. I'm telling you, this
is personally motivated.

10
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:06,086
Now, since I moved out,
he's been doing this.

11
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:09,119
Now if our lovely soprano would like
to stop grumbling for a moment...

12
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:11,362
I'd like to take it once again.

13
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:13,089
- Self-appreciation, my ass.
- Pardon me?

14
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:16,389
I said, fine. Let's do it again.

15
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:20,157
Bar five,

16
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,049
- No kidding? Is that where you're playing?
- Yeah.

17
00:04:30,118 --> 00:04:35,716
He never says, “Honey, I love you.
You doing great job."

18
00:04:35,782 --> 00:04:38,335
I feel he don't respect
me as person...

19
00:04:38,406 --> 00:04:41,221
and I'm just not happy with
stature of our relationship.

20
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:46,174
Mm-hmm. I hear you. Now, I want you to
look at Harry, tell him how you feel.

21
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:52,288
I feel like he's not
plugged into my needs.

22
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,496
I'm not getting enough
the positive feedback.

23
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:57,915
Just look at him shake his head.

24
00:04:57,989 --> 00:05:01,022
Well, now, let's see what
he wants to say here.

25
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:04,737
Harry, how do you feel when
she brings out this material?

26
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:10,651
Well, I feel like she overheats
on every little issue...

27
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:14,074
and every time I go and try to
communicate with the woman...

28
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:18,622
for some unknown reason, she doesn't
believe a damn thing that I say.

29
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:21,758
- Oh, that's a lie!
- See what I mean?

30
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:24,796
No. You wanna know what the
whole thing hinge from?

31
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:27,138
- Mm-hmm.
- He came and rent building from me...

32
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:30,140
- which is now his place of business.
- He's not interested in that.

33
00:05:30,212 --> 00:05:32,285
That's not what he's
asking, See what she does?

34
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:35,706
She wants to dig out and
haul up things, uh...

35
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,366
miscellaneous things, that's
got nothing to do with this.

36
00:05:38,436 --> 00:05:40,891
I hear what you're saying.
Go on.

37
00:05:40,964 --> 00:05:43,833
I mean, I agreed to come down here.
Okay.

38
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:47,737
But I gotta tell ya, Iwo Jima has
got a lot of faulty notions-

39
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:51,009
Oh, right there. Right now. That's
another thing I want to interject.

40
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:53,945
Pardon me, but I was
making a statement here.

41
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:58,078
Yes, let's, um, try to hear
each other out if we can, okay?

42
00:05:58,147 --> 00:06:00,122
Go on, Harry.

43
00:06:06,787 --> 00:06:09,886
Well, I forget the upshot of
what I was saying, but... Okay

44
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:13,730
This is syndrome where I ask him
to address me by my given name...

45
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:15,966
and he just go on
ignoring my wish.

46
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:18,206
- Ignore!
- All right. All right.

47
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:22,529
I hear you. I hear you both.
We're doing good work here,.

48
00:07:30,656 --> 00:07:34,137
Oh, shit.

49
00:07:34,207 --> 00:07:37,557
Fifty bucks a shot
out of my pocket.

50
00:07:37,632 --> 00:07:42,105
I'm supposed to listen to
some pencil-neck butthead...

51
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:44,728
tell me that I don't know
how to relate to you?

52
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:49,109
Daddy, do you want this
marriage to work or not?

53
00:07:50,622 --> 00:07:52,532
I hear you, honey.

54
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:57,561
But how about just a little more
trust on your end of this thing?

55
00:07:57,631 --> 00:08:00,828
Okay? That's all I ask.

56
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:09,562
Get in.

57
00:08:13,757 --> 00:08:16,158
You sure nothing of value has
been removed from the dwelling?

58
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:22,523
Anyone whose dis-pleasures you
might have incurred in some way?

59
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,671
Kind of looks like somebody
doesn't like you, doesn't it?

60
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:30,840
Well, who could it be?

61
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:33,659
You're not married I take it.

62
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:37,173
- She's in the process of a divorce.
- What about him?

63
00:08:37,245 --> 00:08:41,654
What about him? He's our conductor and
an artist. Not someone who would ever-

64
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:44,409
You mean Lewie? No, he would
never do anything like this.

65
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:47,346
- Hello. Anybody home?
- 0h, perfect timing.

66
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,657
- Hi, Joanie.
- Excuse me. It's my sister.

67
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:52,922
I just got back from Hawaii.
Thought I'd drop by for a moment.

68
00:08:52,988 --> 00:08:55,356
What the heck happened in here?

69
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,657
Uh, Andy, this is not the
most opportune time.

70
00:08:57,724 --> 00:09:00,954
- Somebody broke in here last night.
- Oh, that's awful.

71
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,217
- So could I just call you later?
- Could you give me a minute?

72
00:09:04,284 --> 00:09:06,201
I'd like to know if you got
the manuscript I sent you.

73
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:08,314
Um... Who's that?

74
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,453
It's Helen Dextra.
You've met her before

75
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:13,393
Oh. I have? Anyway,
did you read it?

76
00:09:13,468 --> 00:09:15,427
Read what? I don't know
what you're talking about.

77
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:18,011
The book I've written about Red
and me that I sent you a copy of.

78
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:22,386
Is that so hard to follow? - Oh, no, Andy.
You've written a book about Red Layls?

79
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,428
It's not just about Red.

80
00:09:26,812 --> 00:09:29,812
He's only one of many episodes in my life.
You know that.

81
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:32,273
- You got a Perrier?
- I'll get it.

82
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:34,900
No, no. I don't have a Perrier.

83
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:37,524
Now, can I please just
call you at home later?

84
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:39,747
I'm not going to be home. I'm
checking into a hospital...

85
00:09:39,771 --> 00:09:41,625
to have a bone spur
removed from my foot...

86
00:09:41,691 --> 00:09:43,281
and then I'm going to
New York to meet with a

87
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,964
top publisher, which I
would not, by the way...

88
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:47,606
care for Mr. Redmond “Fecal-face“
Layls to know about.

89
00:09:47,675 --> 00:09:50,708
We're gonna be leaving, - Oh, wait.
I need to talk to you.

90
00:09:50,778 --> 00:09:54,575
Do you know what he said to me?
Do you know what he said to me?

91
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:55,550
Can't imagine.

92
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:58,295
Um, I wanted to ask you,
if there is someone...

93
00:09:58,362 --> 00:10:02,192
who for some unknown reason doesn't
like me, what do you suggest I do?

94
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:04,656
I might put some
bars on the windows.

95
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,599
My names's Melvenos, if
you want to get in touch.

96
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:11,351
Really, though. You know, I don't see
how this could be somebody I know.

97
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:13,654
- Maybe not.
- I actually go miles out of my way...

98
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:16,657
to avoid conflictual situations-

99
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,482
My lawyer said, “Don't worry, they're
just pissing into the wind."

100
00:10:20,505 --> 00:10:23,987
I said, “Yeah, they're pissing into the
wind. It's blowing back in my face.“

101
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:26,164
Some help I'm gonna
get from him...

102
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:29,582
- because he's scared to death of Red.
- Andy, are you telling the truth?

103
00:10:29,657 --> 00:10:31,763
Yes, he's afraid.
They're all afraid.

104
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:35,794
You know, speaking of lawyers, one
fell on me while I was sunbathing.

105
00:10:35,865 --> 00:10:38,626
- I mean are you really going to New York?
- Yes, I'm going to New York...

106
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:41,846
where I intend to live in semiprivate
seclusion at an undisclosed address.

107
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:44,673
Great. I could stay at your house. Would
you have your housekeeper leave the keys?

108
00:10:44,696 --> 00:10:48,046
Wait. I-I want you to hear what his
superfluous excellency said about me.

109
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,673
Pardon me, but I don't
care what he said.

110
00:10:50,744 --> 00:10:53,493
My apartment, as you can
see, is a complete shambles.

111
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,758
I have just been informed by a policeman
that somebody doesn't like me...

112
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:59,312
and I really don't want
to stay here by myself.

113
00:10:59,383 --> 00:11:02,449
Fine. Why don't you
take my house then?

114
00:11:21,303 --> 00:11:24,501
My face hurts and
I got an earache.

115
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,678
Come on, Sluggo. Go
hose out the kennel.

116
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:34,512
Now, don't give me
a bad time, Laura.

117
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:38,860
I got enough trouble with Iwo Jima
and all her complaints, all right?

118
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:41,968
Now the woman don't even
believe you're my niece.

119
00:11:42,038 --> 00:11:44,755
Well, I'm not.

120
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:48,270
It's not the point I'm making.

121
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:52,237
Get this, will ya?

122
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,467
Remember, don't say I'm here...

123
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,672
till you find out who it is.

124
00:11:58,742 --> 00:12:01,295
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

125
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:03,275
- Yeah?
- Ferdy, at B.P. Motors. Is Harry there?

126
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:05,513
No, I doubt that he's
here at the present time.

127
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,699
When will he be back in?

128
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:09,643
- Maybe later today sometime.
- Who am I addressing?

129
00:12:09,717 --> 00:12:11,678
- Who are you addressing?
- Yeah. Who am I addressing?

130
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:13,569
The executive kennel maid.
Listen, Miss Kennel

131
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:15,192
Maid. He has to make
payments on the van.

132
00:12:15,253 --> 00:12:17,108
Yeah. - By tomorrow.

133
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:19,614
- Uh-huh. I'll tell him.
- Make sure he understands that, all right?

134
00:12:19,637 --> 00:12:21,841
So Long.

135
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:25,684
- Yeah, who was it?
- Ferdy at “something“ Motors.

136
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:29,545
He wants two payments by tomorrow or
he's gonna come and “re-pop” the van.

137
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,915
Slime.

138
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:37,149
You wanna know what's gonna happen if
I don't pay some of these breeders...

139
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:39,442
and get some adult
dogs on the premises?

140
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,418
Huh?

141
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:44,874
Pretty damn quick some asses are
gonna hit the pavement. Believe me.

142
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:48,298
- Sick of turds anyway
- I can't believe it.

143
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:51,405
Here I am sitting in the
center of all this wealth...

144
00:12:51,476 --> 00:12:56,047
and the escalation in crime couldn't be
better, and I'm not turning a nickel on it.

145
00:12:58,387 --> 00:13:00,591
Oh, shit. - Huh?

146
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:03,441
It's Lee.

147
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:08,724
I'm in Vegas delivering a
couple of dogs to Wayne Newton.

148
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:12,431
Duke, Fug. You don't
know when I'm expected.

149
00:13:49,842 --> 00:13:52,112
Socorro! Socorro!

150
00:13:52,177 --> 00:13:56,651
Wait a minute, please,
I want to talk to you,

151
00:13:58,097 --> 00:14:00,377
Excuse me, Socorro. Do you mind
if I ask what's happening?

152
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:02,954
Why are you leaving?

153
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:07,663
Where are you going? - Esme mijo,
Balthazar. You talk about ok para mi.

154
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:09,626
Yes, yes. What's going on?
Are you bringing her back?

155
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,559
Yeah. Hey, Monday, I
bring her back later.

156
00:14:11,632 --> 00:14:13,738
I can't possible stay
here alone until Monday.

157
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:18,965
No, it's my understanding
Socorro lived here.

158
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:20,910
Otherwise, I would've
made other plans.

159
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:23,977
Yeah, well, she's gotta have her
time off too, man. You know?

160
00:14:26,864 --> 00:14:29,734
Well, this is just glorious.

161
00:15:11,425 --> 00:15:12,750
Blood and kisses... Hey Andy.

162
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:16,314
- Opening in theaters everywhere,
- Hey, Andy, it's Butch.

163
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:18,466
Come on out and say hello
to your old drinking buddy.

164
00:15:20,225 --> 00:15:23,739
- Who are you, honey?
- She's out of town...

165
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:27,159
and there happen to be several other people
here who are trying to get some sleep.

166
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:30,364
Well, why don't you
come out and say hello?

167
00:15:30,433 --> 00:15:33,848
- Will you please go away?
- Stick your head out the door.

168
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:36,856
If you don't leave, I'm going
to call the Foothill patrol.

169
00:15:38,081 --> 00:15:40,798
Well, patrol this, babe, Huh?

170
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,491
Oh, God. Where does she
find these people?

171
00:15:46,561 --> 00:15:51,994
I'm just trying to be nice.
Andy never complained.

172
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:54,454
What's your problem, huh?

173
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,589
Duke, kommen.

174
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:14,359
Duke, sitz. Good. Good, Duke.

175
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,596
Always the name first
and then the command.

176
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,347
“Always the name first”-
Now, in regard to any

177
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,780
aggressor seeking to
give you a bad time...

178
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:25,717
I want to show you what you can
expect from a dog of this caliber.

179
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,192
Here we have the dog's
arsenal, so to speak.

180
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:34,678
The animal is trained to apply pressure
to specific parts of the body...

181
00:16:34,751 --> 00:16:36,605
until the bone is
more or less crushed.

182
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,828
Iftheattacluriscu1ylrgam
oft-gland...

183
00:16:40,894 --> 00:16:45,204
be it a gun, a knife, a club, a
what have you, the dog will-

184
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,093
excuse me for saying-

185
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:51,955
uh, automatically go
for the testicles.

186
00:16:53,342 --> 00:16:56,572
Well, what if I don't
want him to do that?

187
00:16:56,638 --> 00:17:00,381
- You'll want him to do that.
- No, no. I just want him to scare someone.

188
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:02,519
Believe me, this
will scare them...

189
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,845
as well as incapacitate their mind and any
ability they have to maneuver against you.

190
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:10,269
Das is alles, Duke. Kommen

191
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:16,822
You know, I have an extremely sensitive
reaction to dog dander, so maybe-

192
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:18,802
- Let me ask you something.
- Yes.7

193
00:17:18,877 --> 00:17:22,140
I like to get a general picture
of the individual situation.

194
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:25,402
Are you, uh, married?

195
00:17:25,469 --> 00:17:30,106
Single? Living alone or
with some other party?

196
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:32,246
Well, I'm in the process
of a divorce...

197
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:35,831
and I moved up here because
my apartment was burglarized.

198
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:40,210
But I'm not entirely alone. There's
a housekeeper and several friends.

199
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:45,074
Well, the hills are hit heaven
as far as burglaries go.

200
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,865
Right up here on Mulholland...

201
00:17:47,932 --> 00:17:50,966
is where they found the fifth
victim of the Westside Slasher.

202
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,379
Please don't tell me that.

203
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:54,712
Believe me, I know what
you're up against...

204
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,977
being an attractive
and, uh, I take it...

205
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,930
unattached woman
such as you are.

206
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:03,345
But don't worry, we're gonna
remedy that situation right now...

207
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,096
and get you to feel as
safe as a little baby.

208
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:10,491
Well, okay.

209
00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:13,425
What have we got there so far?

210
00:18:13,498 --> 00:18:16,848
Um-

211
00:18:20,347 --> 00:18:23,445
Mm.

212
00:18:23,514 --> 00:18:28,152
All right now, Joan.
Give 'im the command-

213
00:18:28,218 --> 00:18:30,073
Duke-

214
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:33,586
More authority would create an
impression in consciousness for the dog.

215
00:18:33,658 --> 00:18:35,512
Duke-

216
00:18:35,578 --> 00:18:38,130
Good. The dog is now on alert.

217
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:41,744
Very nice piece of real
estate you've got here.

218
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:45,168
- Oh, it's not mine. It's my sister's.
- Oh, your sister's.

219
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:47,096
Mm-hmm. And where is she at?

220
00:18:47,161 --> 00:18:50,338
Am I doing this right? I mean, shouldn't
I be prepared... Never look at your dog.

221
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,046
Ne-“Never look at your dog“?

222
00:18:53,113 --> 00:18:55,503
Okay. - Ha!

223
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:58,000
Oh, my God!

224
00:18:58,073 --> 00:19:01,554
Oh! Ahh!

225
00:19:04,217 --> 00:19:07,567
Damn it. Don't exhibit
fear until I tell ya.

226
00:19:07,641 --> 00:19:10,194
- Stop! Oh!
- Get control of him, Joan.

227
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:13,811
- I'm trying. Good dog. Good dog.
- Give 'im the “off“ command.

228
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,150
I forgot. You tell him.

229
00:19:16,216 --> 00:19:18,769
Duke... My legs-

230
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,005
Whoo! Ow! Stop! Be nice.

231
00:19:22,072 --> 00:19:23,981
Sweet doggy. - Duke!

232
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:26,838
Duke! Duke! Sitz

233
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:27,851
Sitz Duke.

234
00:19:27,863 --> 00:19:30,735
Oh, my golly. I mean,
that was incredible.

235
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:34,157
I love this dog! Oh!
Did you see that?

236
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:39,633
I mean, I can't believe how strong he is.
I felt like a rag doll.

237
00:19:39,703 --> 00:19:43,861
- Well, what did I tell ya?
- Thank you.

238
00:19:43,928 --> 00:19:47,190
Good, good. Good, Duke. Good.

239
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:54,957
Ordinarily, uh, I
wouldn't do this.

240
00:19:55,031 --> 00:19:57,105
Even on a temporary
rental basis...

241
00:19:57,175 --> 00:20:02,444
because he is the absolute top-trained
security and attack dog in the country.

242
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,453
Is, uh, this your sister?

243
00:20:09,335 --> 00:20:12,685
Yes. Yeah. - Who's that?

244
00:20:12,758 --> 00:20:15,607
Oh, that's her third
husband, Eric Ellerman.

245
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,579
Oh. Uh-huh.

246
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:24,624
Wait a minute.

247
00:20:24,694 --> 00:20:30,160
- Who's this guy? Is that Red Layls?
- Yes.

248
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,703
You're kidding. Your sister's
involved with Red Layis?

249
00:20:34,773 --> 00:20:38,123
This guy's gotta be one of the five
or six richest men in the country...

250
00:20:38,198 --> 00:20:41,907
with business connections
all over the place.

251
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,487
And she's your sister.
That is amazing.

252
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:50,770
This is an individual that
I'd like to meet sometime.

253
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:57,297
Mm, What a figure, Mm-mm-mm

254
00:20:58,997 --> 00:21:01,517
I have to say your sister's a
very attractive-looking woman.

255
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:05,582
Well, that's quite a compliment.
I'll have to pass it on.

256
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:15,183
I'll, uh, skip by in
a day or two, okay?

257
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:17,161
- Just to see how you're doing.
- Okay.

258
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:21,012
And, Joan, feel free to
call on me for anything.

259
00:21:21,076 --> 00:21:24,852
Anytime of the night
or day, 24 hours.

260
00:21:27,028 --> 00:21:29,166
It's been a great pleasure
doing business with you.

261
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:42,448
- You big flirt.
- Don't start with that, Dumpty.

262
00:21:42,516 --> 00:21:46,825
This is a quality clientele. It calls
for a certain kind of approach.

263
00:21:46,899 --> 00:21:49,551
Try and soak some
of it in, will ya?

264
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:51,474
Soak this in.

265
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:58,568
Start to pattern yourself.
Breed up.

266
00:21:58,642 --> 00:22:00,497
Observe the woman.

267
00:22:00,562 --> 00:22:02,417
Screw her.

268
00:22:02,482 --> 00:22:06,378
- You don't screw this type of individual.
- You would.

269
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,444
This is the kind of atmosphere
we wanna gravitate towards.

270
00:22:10,514 --> 00:22:14,823
Did she even ask me what it costs?
Damn it, I really respect that.

271
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:16,906
I don't. He isn't even your dog.

272
00:22:21,266 --> 00:22:24,780
Joan, this is Lewie.
Not answering.

273
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:27,240
Saving your voice. I hope so,

274
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:32,530
Perhaps you could concentrate on the music
and reduce the traumas in your life, hmm?

275
00:22:32,593 --> 00:22:36,685
Rehearsal, promptly, 9:00pm.
Tonight.

276
00:22:52,177 --> 00:22:54,031
Are you listening, Joan?

277
00:23:28,143 --> 00:23:32,453
This is supposed to
sound virginal, ladies.

278
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:36,684
So let's just... fake it.

279
00:23:42,895 --> 00:23:45,285
- Don't do that!
- Don't do what?

280
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:47,432
Well, you're never supposed
to look him in the eye.

281
00:23:47,503 --> 00:23:49,412
You have a dog you can't
look in the eye, Joan.7

282
00:23:49,486 --> 00:23:53,861
He's not just a dog. He's a
Schutzhund-trained attack dog. -

283
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:55,908
Oh. Oh.

284
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,272
Well, you didn't have to go
through all this trouble.

285
00:23:59,342 --> 00:24:00,777
You know, if you don't
feel safe at your

286
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:02,519
sister's, I told you I'd
come and stay with you.

287
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:06,819
- No. No.
- God, you are so damn stubborn.

288
00:24:06,894 --> 00:24:11,978
I am not stubborn. I am so
accommodating it is sickening.

289
00:24:12,046 --> 00:24:14,730
But you won't tell me what's
really bothering you.

290
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:19,722
You know, why don't you
confide in my anymore?

291
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,466
I do. - No, no. You don't.

292
00:24:23,534 --> 00:24:25,607
Now, come on. Talk to me.

293
00:24:28,045 --> 00:24:31,394
- Let's have a drink after rehearsal, okay?
- Eddy. Eddy?

294
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,441
You better come. He's
rehearsing the tenors.

295
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:34,339
Not tonight, Eddy.

296
00:24:34,412 --> 00:24:37,610
Well, how about
tomorrow night then?

297
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:39,947
Let's say maybe.

298
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,696
Well, don't go out
of your way, Joan.

299
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,453
Hey. How ya doin'?

300
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:16,610
I have to say that this place is
pretty much of a snap to break into.

301
00:25:16,684 --> 00:25:19,400
I knew it. I never
should've moved here.

302
00:25:19,468 --> 00:25:23,941
Don't worry. The dog will take care
of anyone trying to get inside.

303
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:27,525
Wonder what I should do? Maybe I
should move to a motel or something.

304
00:25:27,595 --> 00:25:31,905
You don't have to do that. This is just
some ding-dong trying to scare you.

305
00:25:31,979 --> 00:25:34,215
Well, he succeeded.

306
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,170
But you don't wanna give
off that impression...

307
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:39,333
because that invites an aggressive
attitude in certain kinds of men.

308
00:25:39,402 --> 00:25:43,811
- I didn't invite this.
- Well, for instance...

309
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:48,356
don't go mincing around, taking mousy
little steps and waving your hankie...

310
00:25:48,426 --> 00:25:50,662
because that draws
a target on you.

311
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:53,763
See? - Do I do that?

312
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,907
Let's see.

313
00:25:55,978 --> 00:25:59,459
Walk back and forth the
way you normally do.

314
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,177
Well, I don't normally
walk back and forth.

315
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:08,800
Okay. Um.

316
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:25,252
I can't do this with
you watching me.

317
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,710
Okay. But, uh...

318
00:26:27,784 --> 00:26:32,422
keep in mind that you want to
exhibit a very confident attitude.

319
00:26:32,488 --> 00:26:36,994
You wanna look like you know where
you're going and what you're doing.

320
00:26:37,064 --> 00:26:42,531
Remember, stop short of
appearing a little, uh, dykey.

321
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,317
Because that's not attractive.

322
00:26:45,384 --> 00:26:48,253
I thought that's your point. Not
to attract... No, no, no, no.

323
00:26:48,328 --> 00:26:51,197
You always wanna remain a
little bit attractive...

324
00:26:51,272 --> 00:26:53,214
otherwise that can
set someone off too.

325
00:26:53,288 --> 00:26:57,598
This is just
impossible, you know?

326
00:26:57,672 --> 00:27:01,021
You know, you just
can't win here.

327
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:05,405
Sure you can. It's just
a matter of degree.

328
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:07,617
Uh-oh. Now, what's this, hmm?

329
00:27:07,687 --> 00:27:08,587
What's this?

330
00:27:08,598 --> 00:27:11,332
I'm sorry, but this is
really getting to me.

331
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:14,913
I-I'll tell you what then.

332
00:27:14,983 --> 00:27:18,496
Why don't you let me take you out
of this place and buy you a drink?

333
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:21,698
See if we can't get your mind
off of these kind of things.

334
00:27:24,582 --> 00:27:28,837
That's very sweet of you, Harry.
I-I think I'd like that.

335
00:27:35,046 --> 00:27:37,501
How long have you been divorced?

336
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:40,443
Oh-I'd say, uh-

337
00:27:40,518 --> 00:27:43,868
seven or eight
years, around there.

338
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:47,139
Mmm. Really?

339
00:27:47,205 --> 00:27:52,322
And, um, do-Well, assuming you
live a single existence...

340
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:56,133
most men don't really seem
to enjoy that... I've read.

341
00:27:57,733 --> 00:28:00,766
I have to tell you the truth.

342
00:28:07,012 --> 00:28:09,315
I've been observing
your hands...

343
00:28:11,012 --> 00:28:14,177
and I have to use the
word, “exquisite.“

344
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,650
Really? Oh.

345
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,264
You're probably
quite a singer too.

346
00:28:29,604 --> 00:28:31,906
I'd love to drop down
and catch you sometime.

347
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,195
Anytime.

348
00:28:38,404 --> 00:28:42,746
Uh, um, do you like
classical music?

349
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,334
Yes, uh, to the degree that
when it's on the radio...

350
00:28:46,404 --> 00:28:48,542
I sometimes have to turn
the damn thing off.

351
00:28:49,571 --> 00:28:51,961
No, no. I just mean that-

352
00:28:52,035 --> 00:28:56,028
it gets to me sometimes.

353
00:28:56,099 --> 00:29:00,191
You know, to the point where I-
I can't swallow my own saliva.

354
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,465
Dinner.

355
00:29:17,812 --> 00:29:20,845
You're full of surprises,
Harry, you know that?

356
00:29:22,132 --> 00:29:24,522
I mean...

357
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:29,778
that you've actually read Dante's
Divine Comedy, I mean, I-

358
00:29:29,844 --> 00:29:34,579
Well, uh, it was a while
back there that I did. Yeah.

359
00:29:35,764 --> 00:29:39,692
“Yet, as a wheel moves
smoothly, free from jars...

360
00:29:40,851 --> 00:29:43,633
“my will and my desire...

361
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:45,773
“are turned by love...

362
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:52,464
the love that moves the
sun and other stars."

363
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:57,736
Ooh, my.

364
00:29:57,811 --> 00:30:01,554
I don't know why, but for some reason the
sublimity of that always touches me...

365
00:30:01,618 --> 00:30:04,237
for some reason.

366
00:30:04,307 --> 00:30:07,504
Thank you.

367
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,592
You know, it's very sad.

368
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:16,456
I-I look at my sister and all
her marriages and affairs-

369
00:30:18,514 --> 00:30:21,548
Not to mention the mess
my own life is in-

370
00:30:21,618 --> 00:30:26,986
and I think, how very
sad and very bleak...

371
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:31,313
that men and women can't
manage to be friends.

372
00:30:31,377 --> 00:30:33,865
What a tragedy that...

373
00:30:33,937 --> 00:30:39,174
sex is often such a barrier to
friendship between men and women.

374
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,374
Not necessarily.

375
00:30:44,465 --> 00:30:49,255
Do you know that Dante and
Beatrice never slept together?

376
00:30:50,385 --> 00:30:52,240
Is that right?

377
00:30:54,481 --> 00:30:57,449
Oh, yeah. I forgot
about that part.

378
00:30:59,568 --> 00:31:04,358
Gee, I shouldn't have had so much saki,
because I prefer to go a little slow here.

379
00:31:06,896 --> 00:31:10,410
We can go as slow as you want.
Why not?

380
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:19,053
So you think that men and
women can be friends?

381
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,974
Oh, absolutely.

382
00:31:30,735 --> 00:31:35,209
Okay. Go ahead. Who
is it this time?

383
00:31:36,655 --> 00:31:38,891
No, this is not what
you're thinking.

384
00:31:38,959 --> 00:31:42,790
This is a very unique individual
I'm talking about here.

385
00:31:42,863 --> 00:31:46,791
First of all, there is a mind there,
as well as a body and a face.

386
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,148
Didn't I hear this before,
about the hostess at Denny's?

387
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:57,064
No. I'm telling you, this is
somethin' completely different.

388
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,005
You should meet her.

389
00:32:02,414 --> 00:32:04,269
She sings opera.

390
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,732
She's got hands
like a hula dancer.

391
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:18,155
There's some people who wanna talk to you.
They're waiting.

392
00:32:22,158 --> 00:32:24,231
Leave this, will ya? - Yeah.

393
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:56,994
You happen to be talking to the
wrong goddamn party, you know that?

394
00:32:57,068 --> 00:33:00,418
Red Layls and I suggest that it's in
your best interest to hear me out.

395
00:33:00,492 --> 00:33:05,893
No. You hear me out. I happen to have
a very high regard for this party...

396
00:33:05,964 --> 00:33:08,965
and maybe even some feelings
of a personal nature here.

397
00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:11,207
In developing certain
information on you.

398
00:33:11,275 --> 00:33:14,658
It's come to our attention that
your name is not Harry Bliss.

399
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:18,049
That, in fact, your name is...

400
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:22,433
- Eugene Earl Axline.
- All right. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

401
00:33:22,507 --> 00:33:25,289
And that due, I'm sure, to some
remunerative oversight on your part...

402
00:33:25,355 --> 00:33:28,225
both the IRS. And an impressive
number of creditors...

403
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:31,975
in several eastern cities seem to be
somewhat interested in your whereabouts.

404
00:33:35,499 --> 00:33:38,794
I can't go around stealing
this lady's property.

405
00:33:38,858 --> 00:33:41,248
No, of course not. You see,
I'd like to pose that...

406
00:33:41,323 --> 00:33:45,153
the good name and reputation of Red Layls
is not the property of Mrs. Ellerman...

407
00:33:45,226 --> 00:33:49,219
or her sister to whom, apparently, a
copy of this manuscript was mailed.

408
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,809
Now, you know what it does?
It puts forth a

409
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,407
libelous and grossly
inaccurate portrayal...

410
00:33:54,474 --> 00:33:57,507
of a very decent man.

411
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:59,913
And it is my hope that
we can just avoid...

412
00:33:59,977 --> 00:34:03,589
any unpleasant
eventualities, Mr. Bliss.

413
00:34:03,658 --> 00:34:05,382
What do you mean, “unpleasant“?

414
00:34:05,449 --> 00:34:08,068
I mean that Mr. Layls
is prepared to do...

415
00:34:08,137 --> 00:34:11,302
whatever it takes to
confiscate this manuscript.

416
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:14,021
If you should elect to assist
us in anyway by finding it...

417
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:17,701
turning it over to me, he's
prepared to make you...

418
00:34:17,769 --> 00:34:21,119
a very generous offer.

419
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:27,973
Look, I hardly know this woman.

420
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,745
I'm renting Hera dog, is all.

421
00:34:31,816 --> 00:34:34,151
What kind of a person
do you take me for?

422
00:34:38,569 --> 00:34:41,864
Sturge.

423
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:03,331
Duke, kommen. Gorgeous dog.

424
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:06,880
Oh, you're so soft,
my sweetie boy.

425
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:08,861
Oh! Now.

426
00:35:08,936 --> 00:35:11,904
Oh, my God. That's not nice.
Ow! No!

427
00:35:11,975 --> 00:35:16,481
No! Now, you" No.

428
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:20,127
Now, Duke. Now, sitz.

429
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:26,022
- Now, sitz and behave yourself.
- That's more like it. -

430
00:35:30,374 --> 00:35:32,229
Oh, no, no, pero. Pero, no.

431
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:58,811
I had a talk with
Helen last night.

432
00:35:58,885 --> 00:36:01,602
I'm extremely concerned
about this situation.

433
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:03,906
I don't want you
living alone up there.

434
00:36:03,973 --> 00:36:07,803
Now, come on. Wouldn't you feel much
safer if you moved back into our house?

435
00:36:07,877 --> 00:36:10,140
No. I would not feel
comfortable doing that.

436
00:36:10,152 --> 00:36:10,910
Come here.

437
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:14,146
Darn it, Lewie, I... What? Are you
afraid of your responses to me?

438
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,068
Why are you resisting?

439
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:18,042
Look, these are
really upsetting...

440
00:36:18,116 --> 00:36:21,379
really shitty circumstances I'm
dealing with, and I'd appreciate it-

441
00:36:21,444 --> 00:36:23,680
Do you have any idea how hard
all this has been on me?

442
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:30,334
Do you think it's that easy for
me to admit I want you back?

443
00:36:30,404 --> 00:36:33,372
Well, couldn't you just
spare yourself that?

444
00:36:33,444 --> 00:36:36,259
Are you seeing anybody?
Just tell me that.

445
00:36:36,324 --> 00:36:39,936
What? Come on. You're
not the abstinent type.

446
00:36:40,004 --> 00:36:44,161
Oh, please don't judge me by
your scrotal excesses, Lew.

447
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,611
I know you're seeing somebody.

448
00:36:49,699 --> 00:36:53,529
- Are you spying on me?
- Come on.

449
00:36:53,603 --> 00:36:57,761
Just be open about it.
You can tell me.

450
00:36:57,827 --> 00:37:01,438
All right. I'm seeing
someone, okay?

451
00:37:03,363 --> 00:37:05,273
I don't believe you.

452
00:37:07,235 --> 00:37:09,089
Who is it?

453
00:37:10,787 --> 00:37:14,202
Now, I want you to look at
Harry, Tell him how you feel.

454
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,633
I don't want you ever
call me Iwo Jima again.

455
00:37:20,707 --> 00:37:25,976
If you can't call me Adele,
don't call me anything at all.

456
00:37:28,386 --> 00:37:31,038
That's a legitimate
request, isn't it?

457
00:37:31,106 --> 00:37:34,304
Mm-hmm.

458
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:37,534
Can you look at Iwo Jima,
Harry, and tell her-

459
00:37:37,602 --> 00:37:39,937
No, no, no. Better yet.

460
00:37:40,002 --> 00:37:42,817
Just take her by the hand...

461
00:37:42,882 --> 00:37:45,250
look at berm.

462
00:37:45,314 --> 00:37:47,616
Just communicate.

463
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:00,382
Oh, that's good.

464
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:04,093
Because there's a lot of
love here, isn't there?

465
00:38:06,177 --> 00:38:09,854
Okay. Next time I want to bring
out some of our sexual hot spots.

466
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,637
- The hell you are, honey.
- The hell I'm not.

467
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:13,915
Not my sex We.

468
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,786
You know, I hate
to mention this,

469
00:38:21,856 --> 00:38:24,758
but we're having a slight
problem with Duke.

470
00:38:24,832 --> 00:38:26,686
What?

471
00:38:26,752 --> 00:38:31,160
Well, he keeps getting up and trying
to ride on one's extremities.

472
00:38:31,232 --> 00:38:34,134
Oh. Well, don't
worry about that.

473
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:37,819
Especially Socorro, who can't speak
English, let alone German...

474
00:38:37,888 --> 00:38:41,434
and sometimes she has to go pulling him
from room to room like a vacuum cleaner.

475
00:38:41,503 --> 00:38:46,937
No, that's, uh, more or less normal
for most of your adult males.

476
00:38:48,447 --> 00:38:52,277
Some percentage of the time they
are going to try to make...

477
00:38:52,351 --> 00:38:54,904
vulgar gestures on your person.

478
00:38:54,975 --> 00:38:57,594
Uh, you just have to
stay on top of 'em.

479
00:39:15,742 --> 00:39:19,736
- It's not affecting you too much, is it?
- No.

480
00:39:19,806 --> 00:39:22,195
It's very nice. - Oh, good.

481
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,660
It's Chopin. It's a nocturne.

482
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:29,623
You know what is affecting me?

483
00:39:29,694 --> 00:39:33,371
- “Night piece," it means.
- You are.

484
00:39:35,837 --> 00:39:39,187
Harry, I-I think I
should say something.

485
00:39:39,261 --> 00:39:41,170
Don't worry about it.

486
00:39:43,261 --> 00:39:45,531
No, that's the problem.
You see, I-I-

487
00:39:45,597 --> 00:39:47,987
- There's no problem.
- Well, I wanna be honest with you...

488
00:39:48,061 --> 00:39:53,331
because I recently realized
something about myself...

489
00:39:53,404 --> 00:39:55,259
um...

490
00:39:56,988 --> 00:40:00,665
that I have slept with a
number of men in my life...

491
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:03,449
just because I didn't
want them not to like me.

492
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:08,694
Mm-hmm. - But, uh...

493
00:40:08,764 --> 00:40:11,154
the thing is, I didn't like
most of them that much, so...

494
00:40:11,228 --> 00:40:14,905
I don't know why I cared
whether they liked me or not.

495
00:40:17,628 --> 00:40:19,864
You know-

496
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:24,852
I'm not, uh-not one of these
guys who's going to...

497
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:29,561
look upon you as a-as an object.

498
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:32,660
Oh, no. I know. I know that.
That's not what I'm saying.

499
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:36,114
Because I look upon
a woman as a whole.

500
00:40:39,643 --> 00:40:41,879
What I'm saying is that...

501
00:40:43,547 --> 00:40:48,021
I don't know if right now I
might not go to bed with you...

502
00:40:48,091 --> 00:40:50,393
just because I don't
want to be alone.

503
00:40:50,459 --> 00:40:55,096
- Uh-huh.
- Sol thought maybe we could...

504
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:59,953
try and explore other modes or-

505
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:02,743
Other modes?

506
00:41:02,811 --> 00:41:08,179
There are other ways of being intimate
that people don't even realize.

507
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,520
Uh-huh.

508
00:41:10,586 --> 00:41:13,303
Which doesn't mean I'm
not attracted to you.

509
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:17,844
But, uh, you don't want
me to bring you around?

510
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:21,977
“Bring me around"?

511
00:41:25,465 --> 00:41:27,320
Other modes is fine.

512
00:41:29,241 --> 00:41:31,892
You don't have to
be shy with me.

513
00:41:39,577 --> 00:41:43,407
Oh, God. It's so hard to
pioneer in this area.

514
00:42:03,832 --> 00:42:05,807
Hi, it's Andy.

515
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,888
I've gone out to a
writer's block party.

516
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,709
Please leave a
message at the beep,

517
00:42:10,775 --> 00:42:14,354
loan? joanie? joanie,
are you there?

518
00:42:14,423 --> 00:42:16,431
It's Andy.

519
00:42:16,503 --> 00:42:21,839
I'm calling to inform you that
these people are drugging me.

520
00:42:21,911 --> 00:42:25,261
I have no phone in my
room, or cable TV.

521
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:28,685
I've had to sneak into
this cell next to me...

522
00:42:28,758 --> 00:42:32,240
with some poor, lithium zombie lying
here like a comatose cabbage.

523
00:42:32,311 --> 00:42:35,922
- Maybe I better take this.
- These are the lengths this assassin...

524
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,635
is willing to go to suppress me because
he does not want me to have my book.

525
00:42:39,703 --> 00:42:42,289
- Would you excuse me?
- Please z/oan/e,

526
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:45,075
- It's my sister.
- Please, help!

527
00:42:45,142 --> 00:42:48,307
- Andy, it's Joan.
- Oh, you're there. Thank God.

528
00:42:48,374 --> 00:42:51,571
Oh, where are you?
Are-Are you in New York?

529
00:42:51,638 --> 00:42:53,472
No. That's what I'm telling you.
I checked

530
00:42:53,484 --> 00:42:55,501
into the hospital to have
a bone spur removed.

531
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:58,510
Yes, I know. You told me that.
But, where are you now?

532
00:42:58,582 --> 00:43:00,312
The next thing I know,
I'm transported

533
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:02,378
someplace the hell else
against my knowledge.

534
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,789
- I was completely medicated.
- Wait. Wait a minute-

535
00:43:04,854 --> 00:43:07,090
Do you understand the
implications of this?

536
00:43:07,157 --> 00:43:09,677
I-I-I have no underpants on

537
00:43:09,749 --> 00:43:12,598
and absolutely no recourse to
my rights-joanie? - Oh, my God!

538
00:43:12,662 --> 00:43:15,030
- Ow! Ooh!
- This is because of Red, isn't it?

539
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:18,290
Yes, this is because of Red.
Isn't that obvious?

540
00:43:18,357 --> 00:43:23,148
And If he, that lawyer and his
paid employee think that they-

541
00:43:23,221 --> 00:43:26,157
Wait. I think I hear
someone coming.

542
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:29,579
- What am I supposed to do?
- Find out where she is.

543
00:43:29,652 --> 00:43:32,467
Andy. Andy. You have to
tell me where you are.

544
00:43:32,532 --> 00:43:36,209
I told you I don't know where I am.
These bastards are very clever.

545
00:43:36,276 --> 01:27:12,551
I'm in some private cracker box in the
boonies with goddamn wires on the windows.

546
00:43:36,276 --> 00:43:36,298
I'm in some private cracker box in the
boonies with goddamn wires on the windows.

547
00:43:36,299 --> 00:43:38,721
- Find out where the first hospital is.
- Oh, yeah.

548
00:43:42,534 --> 00:43:47,008
Andy. Andy. Tell me the name of the
hospital you checked yourself into.

549
00:43:47,078 --> 00:43:48,987
Mount Haven. It's
in the South Bay.

550
00:43:49,062 --> 00:43:51,811
Stop asking these inane questions
and please, just do something.

551
00:43:51,877 --> 00:43:55,554
- Tell her we'll find her.
- Andy, we'll find you, okay?

552
00:43:55,621 --> 00:43:58,174
Shh! I have to get off.
I hear someone coming.

553
00:43:58,245 --> 00:44:01,279
Wha-Andy. Andy?

554
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:05,442
- Oh, what should I do?
- Sh-Should I call the police?

555
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:09,667
No. Let's take a run out there.

556
00:44:09,733 --> 00:44:14,850
You mean r-right now?

557
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:19,166
Ah. “Ellerman, Antonia."

558
00:44:19,237 --> 00:44:22,980
Admitted on the third of the month and
signed out by her personal physician...

559
00:44:23,045 --> 00:44:25,646
following observation... Well, how
do you know it was her physician?

560
00:44:25,669 --> 00:44:29,826
Hell, I could come in here and say I
was a doctor and sign somebody out.

561
00:44:29,892 --> 00:44:32,653
And even if he was a doctor, that
doesn't mean he was my sister's doctor.

562
00:44:32,676 --> 00:44:36,670
Well, it says here that she was under
observation for clinical depression.

563
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,359
Well, that's a lie. She was
here for an operation...

564
00:44:39,428 --> 00:44:42,494
then she was drugged and taken
out of here against her will.

565
00:44:42,564 --> 00:44:46,078
And that she was signed out at 3:45 pm.
On the fourth.

566
00:44:46,148 --> 00:44:48,700
Okay, let's stop
wastin' time here.

567
00:44:48,771 --> 00:44:50,812
Where is this guy,
uh, what's his name?

568
00:44:50,884 --> 00:44:55,838
His name is Dr. Monroe Park.
Doesn't say where he is.

569
00:44:55,907 --> 00:44:59,170
What kind of a business are
you running here, buddy?

570
00:44:59,235 --> 00:45:01,051
If you would like to
call the physician's

571
00:45:01,063 --> 00:45:03,065
registry, there are
public phones over there.

572
00:45:03,139 --> 00:45:06,587
I'm sure he's listed with them.

573
00:45:09,603 --> 00:45:12,320
Nothing. No Dr. Monroe Park.

574
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:20,988
How am I supposed to find this man
when maybe he used a false name?

575
00:45:21,058 --> 00:45:24,735
- Or maybe he isn't even a doctor.
- I've got a few ideas.

576
00:45:24,802 --> 00:45:27,836
First we wanna connect
up with Red Layls.

577
00:45:27,906 --> 00:45:30,940
Oh, no. I don't wanna have anything
to do with him. I'm terrified of him.

578
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:33,181
There is nothing to worry
about, believe me.

579
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,316
I mean, you hear all kinds of things
about government kickbacks...

580
00:45:36,386 --> 00:45:40,379
- and Panamanian drug couriers.
- I know these type of guys.

581
00:45:40,449 --> 00:45:43,767
You take away their money and
their power and what are they?

582
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:47,999
I told her she shouldn't do this. I
mean, to be so maniacally obsessed...

583
00:45:48,066 --> 00:45:51,896
with this soul of mud that she'd wanna
write a book about him is beyond me.

584
00:45:51,969 --> 00:45:55,067
I have to do something. I
have to go to the police.

585
00:45:55,137 --> 00:45:57,211
If only I could find
the manuscript.

586
00:45:57,281 --> 00:45:59,671
Let's hold off on
that for a bit.

587
00:45:59,745 --> 00:46:03,259
I wanna talk to this private investigator
who's a close, personal friend of mine...

588
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:05,239
see if he can find out
who this doctor is.

589
00:46:05,312 --> 00:46:09,109
This isn't your problem, Harry.
I don't wanna draw you into it.

590
00:46:09,185 --> 00:46:11,160
You're not drawing me in, honey.

591
00:46:14,368 --> 00:46:16,758
We'll find your sister, okay?

592
00:46:24,928 --> 00:46:29,238
Um, Socorro, may I speak to
you for a moment, please?

593
00:46:29,312 --> 00:46:32,759
Um, I am looking for
my sister's book.

594
00:46:36,191 --> 00:46:39,868
No, no, no, no, no.
Um, “Ia manuscripto"

595
00:46:39,935 --> 00:46:43,318
Ia manuscripto.

596
00:46:43,392 --> 00:46:45,694
Andy? Si, Si

597
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:49,436
I go adolocasa

598
00:46:49,503 --> 00:46:54,773
Um, everywhere, looking y
looking yno es anywhere.

599
00:46:54,847 --> 00:46:57,400
Um, uh, uh-Sabe usted?

600
00:48:36,316 --> 00:48:38,422
Soco!

601
00:48:41,435 --> 00:48:44,785
Soco, I, uh-I left
my watch in there.

602
00:48:44,859 --> 00:48:48,122
I wanna go in there
and look for it.

603
00:48:48,187 --> 00:48:50,096
Okay. - Thank you.

604
00:49:11,802 --> 00:49:14,999
Duke, sitz, sitz

605
00:50:07,512 --> 00:50:10,807
I must say, this is a
dazzling piece of work.

606
00:50:10,872 --> 00:50:14,102
But I've read where you're a little
sensitive about the criticism you've had...

607
00:50:14,168 --> 00:50:16,558
over the amount of sexual
violence and nudity in the movie.

608
00:50:16,631 --> 00:50:19,021
It happens to be a tradition
in this kind of film...

609
00:50:19,095 --> 00:50:21,910
that women make more interesting
and exciting victims than men do.

610
00:50:21,975 --> 00:50:24,463
I understand but... Asshole.

611
00:50:24,535 --> 00:50:26,781
The violence that's directed
at Mimi's character

612
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:28,725
is an essential component
to the story...

613
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:31,989
and is, in no sense of
the word, gratuitous.

614
00:50:32,055 --> 00:50:36,332
But, Mimi, what about you? That scene where
you run nude through Times Square...

615
00:50:36,407 --> 00:50:40,564
with multiple knife wounds all over your
body, that must have been horrendous

616
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:43,980
It was very horrendous.

617
00:50:44,054 --> 00:50:48,364
But what helped me enormously is
that we shot the film in sequence...

618
00:50:48,439 --> 00:50:51,789
and that scene came directly after
the gang rape in the elevator.

619
00:50:51,862 --> 00:50:54,798
- Come on. Let me drive you home.
- Mm. No, wait.

620
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:57,554
And, also, I love Dick's taste.

621
00:50:57,622 --> 00:50:59,859
Sol knew that he was handling
it very artistically.

622
00:50:59,926 --> 00:51:02,675
It wasn't just going to be
sex for the sake of sex.

623
00:51:18,102 --> 00:51:20,469
You okay? - Yeah.

624
00:51:20,533 --> 00:51:22,507
Oh, my God!

625
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:32,306
God! - Oh, God!

626
00:51:34,069 --> 00:51:37,779
- Getaway!
- Don't unlock the door!

627
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,819
No'. No'.

628
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,050
Get out of the car! - I can't!

629
00:51:51,284 --> 00:51:54,547
Socorro!

630
00:51:56,628 --> 00:52:00,654
I can't! - No!

631
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,426
Socorro! Duke!

632
00:52:07,987 --> 00:52:10,224
Loan, help! jean!

633
00:52:29,843 --> 00:52:32,396
_ -Joan!

634
00:52:49,106 --> 00:52:52,303
No! No!

635
00:53:23,185 --> 00:53:26,054
Why didn't you have the dog with you?
It's what he's for.

636
00:53:26,129 --> 00:53:28,016
I told you, he was in the house.

637
00:53:28,081 --> 00:53:30,470
What the hell good is that?

638
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:33,261
You must have him with
you at all times.

639
00:53:33,328 --> 00:53:36,526
Well, I can't have him with me at all
times. He's killing my mucus membranes.

640
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:39,461
Didn't I tell you right from the
start that it was very dangerous...

641
00:53:39,536 --> 00:53:41,574
to fool around with
people like Red Layls?

642
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:42,405
No, you didn't.

643
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,197
I said he was dangerous,
you said he wasn't.

644
00:53:45,264 --> 00:53:47,271
That was before he
tried to part your

645
00:53:47,283 --> 00:53:49,673
hair with an ax. I don't
know if it was him or not

646
00:53:49,743 --> 00:53:53,388
- Maybe it was that tree surgeon.
- All right, now wait a minute.

647
00:53:53,456 --> 00:53:55,596
How tall was he, about
6'1 kind of ugly skin?

648
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:56,325
Excuse me.

649
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,465
Oh! Jesus!

650
00:53:59,535 --> 00:54:01,990
Sorry.

651
00:54:02,063 --> 00:54:04,965
He was about your height.

652
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:07,908
No, he wasn't. He
was much taller.

653
00:54:07,983 --> 00:54:11,148
Oh, let's not quibble about the
man's dimensions for God's sake.

654
00:54:11,215 --> 00:54:13,866
That can't be the same man who
burglarized my apartment...

655
00:54:13,934 --> 00:54:15,982
because that happened
before I came up here.

656
00:54:15,993 --> 00:54:16,870
Forget about him.

657
00:54:16,943 --> 00:54:18,984
I know what I'm talking about.

658
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:21,258
Uh, pardon me,

659
00:54:21,326 --> 00:54:25,516
This is not a job, you
know, for an amateur.

660
00:54:25,582 --> 00:54:29,096
And, Joan, if you do not call the police,
then I am not going to stay here anymore.

661
00:54:31,342 --> 00:54:35,751
Guys like Red Layls have
hit men workin' for 'em.

662
00:54:35,822 --> 00:54:38,212
They drive 'em around and
do their dirty work.

663
00:54:38,285 --> 00:54:42,956
I am calling a cab. I have an
early appointment tomorrow.

664
00:54:49,631 --> 00:54:54,780
You know what I think? I think
it's more than one person.

665
00:54:54,847 --> 00:54:59,255
It's not more than one person.
I'm tellin' you who it is.

666
00:54:59,326 --> 00:55:04,345
Yes, but I don't think Red Layos would have
someone whisper into my answering machine.

667
00:55:04,415 --> 00:55:07,308
It's just not something
that he would do.

668
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:08,375
Damn it Joan.

669
00:55:08,446 --> 00:55:12,090
God, what is this? I can't say
anything to you anymore,.

670
00:55:12,158 --> 00:55:15,159
You're so darn touchy, Harry.

671
00:55:16,926 --> 00:55:19,828
You can mention anything
you want to me, honey.

672
00:55:19,902 --> 00:55:24,375
I just don't wanna see you
turn up face down. That's all.

673
00:55:29,821 --> 00:55:32,473
Couldn't you be a
little nicer about it?

674
00:55:35,773 --> 00:55:39,385
It's, uh-It's Andy's.

675
00:55:41,117 --> 00:55:44,663
Well, it certainly
is becoming on you.

676
00:55:44,733 --> 00:55:49,272
Well, I probably don't
quite fill it out, but-

677
00:55:50,397 --> 00:55:53,943
Oh, yes, you do.

678
00:56:04,092 --> 00:56:05,947
What's wrong, Harry?

679
00:56:56,762 --> 00:56:58,803
Uh-

680
00:57:19,578 --> 00:57:23,920
Harry, what the hell
you think you doing?

681
00:57:23,993 --> 00:57:29,591
I, uh-I just got a phone call, honey,
from a prominent entertainer up in Vegas.

682
00:57:29,657 --> 00:57:32,309
- Avery well known singer.
- Well, who is it, Paul Anka?

683
00:57:32,377 --> 00:57:34,529
He's a rock star. You wouldn't
know his name. - Uh-huh.

684
00:57:34,553 --> 00:57:36,626
Anyway, I gotta run a
couple of dogs up to him.

685
00:57:36,697 --> 00:57:39,566
You know, it's T-minus-zero
and counting...

686
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,549
Harry, on this
whole shitty deal.

687
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:45,171
Now, Iwo, don't blow
this out of proportion.

688
00:57:45,241 --> 00:57:49,812
If you leave, I'm getting Top Lock come
over here, change front and back door.

689
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:53,230
Look, I'm talkin' about a short period of
time, here. - Oh, Ming, Tippy, shut up!

690
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:55,377
Shut up!

691
00:57:55,448 --> 00:57:58,230
Ming, Tippy... No, no. I mean it.
You get in that van...

692
00:57:58,296 --> 00:58:01,231
I'm taking my building back and I'm
putting in the fingernail salon.

693
00:58:01,304 --> 00:58:05,778
Come on, now, honey. Let's not make
a big issue out of it, okay? Hmm?

694
00:58:05,848 --> 00:58:08,335
All right?

695
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:18,988
Okay, honey.

696
00:58:22,231 --> 00:58:26,487
Ming, Tippy, say good-bye
to Harry for good.

697
00:58:32,567 --> 00:58:36,178
- It's very nice-Looking, honey.
- Do you like it?

698
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:39,629
Oh, yeah. I do.

699
00:58:39,703 --> 00:58:42,190
It's something that
I really needed.

700
00:58:44,246 --> 00:58:46,636
Thank you. - You're welcome.

701
00:59:00,789 --> 00:59:03,855
You're probably wondering
why I'm smiling.

702
00:59:07,253 --> 00:59:09,108
What?

703
00:59:09,173 --> 00:59:13,876
Well, I was just thinking that I find
this moody side of you very attractive.

704
00:59:13,941 --> 00:59:17,072
Oh. Uh-huh.

705
00:59:18,101 --> 00:59:20,011
In fact, if you want to know-

706
00:59:20,084 --> 00:59:23,249
and, well I can see
you're dying to-

707
00:59:26,133 --> 00:59:29,264
I completely adore you, Harry.

708
00:59:33,396 --> 00:59:38,448
You know, Joan, there's something I feel I
have to say that's been preying on my mind-

709
00:59:39,572 --> 00:59:41,427
something that maybe I
could have handled...

710
00:59:41,492 --> 00:59:43,947
a little bit differently
with you at the time-

711
00:59:45,172 --> 00:59:49,776
about this... particular
situation that I'm in.

712
00:59:49,843 --> 00:59:50,917
What situation?

713
00:59:50,929 --> 00:59:54,120
You may recall that I
mentioned a while ago...

714
00:59:54,195 --> 00:59:58,450
about being finished with a
certain relationship... -

715
00:59:58,516 --> 01:00:02,378
- that I more or less ended-
- What? Well-Well, wait!

716
01:00:02,451 --> 01:00:05,233
”Regarding an earlier press release
announcing Mrs. Ellerman's-

717
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,729
iMira esto!

718
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:09,869
Shh, shh, shh, which reportedly
contain several explosive details...

719
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:13,070
Joan, Joan - concerning Redmond Layls's
controversial business dealings,

720
01:00:13,139 --> 01:00:15,289
Mr, Layls's lawyer,
Laurence Moncrief, had

721
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,612
this to say when asked
if he was concerned...

722
01:00:17,682 --> 01:00:20,912
about what might be revealed
in the Ellerman book. -

723
01:00:20,978 --> 01:00:22,833
I have no knowledge
whatsoever...

724
01:00:22,898 --> 01:00:27,023
about Mrs. Ellerman's so-called
book, or her alleged disappearance-

725
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,545
which appears to have all the
earmarks of a publicity stunt.

726
01:00:29,618 --> 01:00:32,106
- Oh, can you believe this?
- Recent reports...

727
01:00:32,179 --> 01:00:36,521
of Layls's failing health were denied
by his personal physician, Dr. Park.

728
01:00:36,594 --> 01:00:40,009
When questioned in a phone interview, he
responded that the elusive billionaire...

729
01:00:40,082 --> 01:00:44,174
was recovering from, quote, “nothing
more than an ordinary virus.“

730
01:00:44,242 --> 01:00:46,446
- Meanwhile, there seems to be-
- Do you see that?

731
01:00:46,514 --> 01:00:47,054
What?

732
01:00:47,065 --> 01:00:48,762
Monroe Park. That's the
name of the doctor...

733
01:00:48,786 --> 01:00:51,339
that checked Andy out
of the hospital.

734
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:55,153
Well, I'm not sure that was the
guy's name... Yes, it was. Shh.

735
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:59,975
This is Heidi Robles reporting to you
from Monroe Park Center in San Dimas.

736
01:01:00,049 --> 01:01:02,472
Where's San Dimas?

737
01:01:02,546 --> 01:01:05,644
Let's call the TV station.
We'll find out.

738
01:01:05,713 --> 01:01:07,931
I'm not sure this is the way you
wanna handle this situation.

739
01:01:07,943 --> 01:01:10,317
Don't start that again, Harry.

740
01:01:11,857 --> 01:01:15,239
Soco, tell her. She don't wanna
mess around with these people.

741
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,455
First, you tell me I go around
acting like a little mouse...

742
01:01:28,528 --> 01:01:31,768
then when I feel I could save the pope in
an earthquake, you start undermining me.

743
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:33,898
This is not the pope
we're talkin' about.

744
01:01:33,968 --> 01:01:36,126
Anyway, I didn't ask you
to drag along with me.

745
01:01:36,138 --> 01:01:37,613
You're the one that's dragging.

746
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,167
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Just drive the car.

747
01:01:46,448 --> 01:01:49,383
What exit is this?

748
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:52,107
What difference does it make?
We're not goin' anywhere.

749
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:54,859
Yeah, well, just tell me
where the turnoff is.

750
01:02:05,295 --> 01:02:08,110
- Let me drive, huh?
- Why should I let you drive?

751
01:02:08,175 --> 01:02:10,630
Why? Because you're a
bad driver, that's why.

752
01:02:10,703 --> 01:02:13,071
Oh. Now all the ugly
little truths come out.

753
01:02:13,134 --> 01:02:15,109
You operate this vehicle
as though it was...

754
01:02:15,183 --> 01:02:19,438
a cane with a red tip
painted on the end of it.

755
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:21,592
Someone abates your maidenhood,
and then all of a sudden...

756
01:02:21,615 --> 01:02:25,411
they feel that they can
start ordering you around.

757
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:49,187
- Can I at least offer some advice?
- No.

758
01:02:49,261 --> 01:02:53,702
Good. Why don't you just barge into the
place, honey, and play the big hero?

759
01:02:53,773 --> 01:02:58,115
When he tells you your sister's not
there, what are you gonna do, cry?

760
01:03:00,909 --> 01:03:02,764
Okay. What?

761
01:03:33,036 --> 01:03:35,174
I can't believe I let
you talk me into this.

762
01:03:35,243 --> 01:03:37,633
- You look like a busboy in that outfit.
- Not now, honey.

763
01:03:37,707 --> 01:03:41,799
- Not even a waiter. A busboy.
- Honey, please. Uh, Nurse-

764
01:03:41,867 --> 01:03:42,759
Yes?

765
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:45,479
We're looking for the room
of Miss Andy Ellerman.

766
01:03:47,371 --> 01:03:49,924
- I hope you know what you're doing.
- Sonya-

767
01:03:49,995 --> 01:03:52,035
- Yeah? - Who were those people?

768
01:03:57,963 --> 01:04:01,411
Doctor? Doctor, just
a minute, please.

769
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:08,115
Yes, what's the problem, dear?

770
01:04:08,127 --> 01:04:10,600
Uh, we're trying to
contact Dr. Park now...

771
01:04:10,666 --> 01:04:13,831
just to make sure that he's authorized
you to examine Mrs. Ellerman...

772
01:04:13,898 --> 01:04:16,549
because, you know, we have our rules
and our regulations to follow.

773
01:04:16,618 --> 01:04:19,073
- I understand. You're doing your job.
- Mm-hmm.

774
01:04:19,145 --> 01:04:21,928
Where did your assistant go?

775
01:04:21,994 --> 01:04:26,336
Um, she had to step inside
to relieve herself.

776
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:29,727
And if that little King Lear of corporate
shit thinks he can get away with this...

777
01:04:29,801 --> 01:04:32,420
just wait till he hears what
I'm gonna come outwith now.

778
01:04:32,489 --> 01:04:33,084
Put this on.

779
01:04:33,095 --> 01:04:34,912
Remember when you passed
me off as staff...

780
01:04:34,985 --> 01:04:37,044
when I was put on official
government payroll

781
01:04:37,056 --> 01:04:38,946
all through Maui and
the Yucatan mission?

782
01:04:39,017 --> 01:04:41,042
No, I don't. Oh, yes, you do.
You remember.

783
01:04:41,053 --> 01:04:42,913
That's when I almost
died of vomitonegro.

784
01:04:42,984 --> 01:04:45,188
What do you specialize
in, Doctor?

785
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:49,033
Um, female troubles,
I'd say, mainly.

786
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:54,433
Oh-ho, so Dr. Park feels there's a
gynecological involvement here?

787
01:04:54,504 --> 01:04:56,512
Sometimes he does, yes.

788
01:04:56,584 --> 01:04:59,847
Sonya. Sonya! May I
speak to you, please?

789
01:04:59,912 --> 01:05:02,760
- Joan. Joan!
- I'm just finishing her hair.

790
01:05:02,824 --> 01:05:05,726
Hurry up. - Is that him?

791
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,037
Let's go.

792
01:05:10,376 --> 01:05:14,020
- Oh, this is not attractive.
- Oh, but-

793
01:05:15,048 --> 01:05:17,219
Take it easy. I'll
be right back.

794
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:20,583
Doctor? Doctor?

795
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:26,117
That was my supervisor, and she wonders
if you'd do us a little favor.

796
01:05:26,183 --> 01:05:28,453
- Certainly.
- Would you mind waiting...

797
01:05:28,519 --> 01:05:30,560
in reception until we can
clear this matter up?

798
01:05:30,631 --> 01:05:34,210
- Be glad to, Nurse.
- Thank you.

799
01:05:39,399 --> 01:05:41,949
You know what that prick
had his lawyer tell me?

800
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:42,814
No.

801
01:05:42,887 --> 01:05:45,985
That I was some petty,
grudge-bearing little malcontent...

802
01:05:46,054 --> 01:05:50,048
grasping at some splinter of
celebrity for myself at his expense.

803
01:05:52,614 --> 01:05:54,523
Can you believe that?

804
01:05:56,391 --> 01:05:58,726
- Put this on.
- I mean, the arrogance-

805
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:01,659
- Here. - No, I-Here.

806
01:06:01,734 --> 01:06:04,189
You know? - Mm-hmm.

807
01:06:04,262 --> 01:06:06,979
- What did she say your name was?
- Harry.

808
01:06:30,437 --> 01:06:33,754
50 he says, “Read the card."

809
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:40,450
loan! Joan! Are you there?

810
01:06:40,516 --> 01:06:43,069
They locked the door.

811
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:46,403
- Is that you?
- Yes it's me. Harry, they locked the door.

812
01:06:46,468 --> 01:06:49,633
I'm having a little trouble
getting back inside.

813
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:52,319
Great. What have
you got me into?

814
01:06:52,388 --> 01:06:54,592
Hold your water.
Everything's under control.

815
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:56,733
Harry, just get me out of here.

816
01:06:56,804 --> 01:07:00,896
Hang on for a minute or two more, honey.
I'll be right back.

817
01:07:11,368 --> 01:07:13,790
And some privacy would be nice.
Andy, could you-

818
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:19,134
Could you stay here? I don't need you
right now. Andy? Larry Moncrief.

819
01:07:22,056 --> 01:07:25,405
Uh, would you care to sit up?
I'd like to talk to you.

820
01:07:41,415 --> 01:07:43,870
You son of a bitch.

821
01:07:46,151 --> 01:07:49,053
- Who is it?
- Who the hell do you think it is?

822
01:07:53,287 --> 01:07:55,196
Sweetheart...

823
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:58,139
is that you?

824
01:07:58,214 --> 01:08:00,702
No thanks to you, it's me.

825
01:08:02,342 --> 01:08:05,407
No, I don't want
to talk about it.

826
01:08:05,477 --> 01:08:09,340
I'm the one who knew what you were doing in
the Yucatan Peninsula. I was on payroll.

827
01:08:09,413 --> 01:08:12,544
Regrettably, we had to make a
justifiable entry into your house...

828
01:08:12,613 --> 01:08:14,719
to appropriate
your manuscript...

829
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:18,271
from which I have made a
list of certain deletions...

830
01:08:18,342 --> 01:08:21,375
which I would very much like you
to take a look at before...

831
01:08:21,445 --> 01:08:24,031
Red arrives.

832
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:27,331
I'm the one who knew what you were
doing with those-those Chinese people.

833
01:08:27,397 --> 01:08:31,390
And what about the illegal oil
drilling off the Mexican Gulf?

834
01:08:31,461 --> 01:08:37,178
You know, personally, I don't think
this emasculates your work in any way.

835
01:08:37,252 --> 01:08:39,642
Andy, would you-would you care-

836
01:08:43,716 --> 01:08:46,684
Fine. If you're gonna be silly about
this and push this thing too far...

837
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:51,808
then you do run the risk of having Red
withdraw his consent to your well-being.

838
01:08:51,876 --> 01:08:54,581
And I don't think that we want that.
Do we, Andy?

839
01:08:54,593 --> 01:08:55,593
Andy's not here.

840
01:08:55,652 --> 01:08:58,816
Yes. I can see that-

841
01:08:58,884 --> 01:09:01,120
Mm Spruance.

842
01:09:01,188 --> 01:09:03,097
Care to tell me where
exactly she is?

843
01:09:03,171 --> 01:09:05,771
As a matter of fact, she happens
to be on her way to the police...

844
01:09:05,795 --> 01:09:07,966
right now, accompanied by
a close friend of mine.

845
01:09:08,035 --> 01:09:11,898
Honey, it's me again.

846
01:09:11,971 --> 01:09:15,288
Hello - Harry, don't say a word.

847
01:09:15,363 --> 01:09:18,015
- Sturge.
- I gotta tell you something.

848
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:20,898
I'm not alone. - Who's there?

849
01:09:20,963 --> 01:09:24,225
- Just go get Andy and leave.
- That's what I'm tryin' to tell ya.

850
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:27,706
Oh. Hello, Mr. Bliss.

851
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:31,135
I think you'd better
come up here.

852
01:09:31,203 --> 01:09:33,211
- Shh.
- You know, I'm a little...

853
01:09:33,282 --> 01:09:35,388
disappointed to see you
defaulting on our agreement.

854
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:37,881
What agreement?

855
01:09:37,954 --> 01:09:40,736
- What agreement?
- I never agreed to anything, honey.

856
01:09:40,803 --> 01:09:44,349
This guy tried to bribe me into working
for him, and I told him to go to hell.

857
01:09:44,418 --> 01:09:48,990
Oh really? Well, I think an agreement was
implicit in your acceptance of my check.

858
01:09:49,058 --> 01:09:51,927
You wanna see your check?

859
01:09:52,002 --> 01:09:55,646
Honey, don't go by
anything this guy says.

860
01:09:57,058 --> 01:10:01,368
I'm the only one who knows
what in the hell I am doing.

861
01:10:01,441 --> 01:10:05,402
I was gonna tell ya. It just
slipped my mind. Ah-ha.

862
01:10:05,473 --> 01:10:09,216
You see? You see {hm

863
01:10:09,281 --> 01:10:12,893
I never even cashed it!

864
01:10:12,961 --> 01:10:15,863
Put him in the car.

865
01:10:15,937 --> 01:10:17,345
Harry!

866
01:10:25,536 --> 01:10:27,926
What did that bastard do to you?

867
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,902
I need a Kleenex. - Oh.

868
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:33,399
Let go of my hair!

869
01:10:33,472 --> 01:10:35,414
Now, you know what
they're trying to do?

870
01:10:35,488 --> 01:10:38,336
They're trying to force you into
signing some kind of agreement that-

871
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:42,329
Wait. I want you to hear
what he said to me.

872
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,629
He told me that I was the only woman
that he ever really cared for.

873
01:10:45,696 --> 01:10:48,860
What? - And when he said that-

874
01:10:48,928 --> 01:10:51,776
there was a tear in his eye.

875
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:59,256
Sorry. The door was
locked when I came-

876
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:03,549
- Get me something cold to drink.
- Uh, tea. feed tea.

877
01:11:10,687 --> 01:11:12,872
You don't know what you're saying.
Now, you're suffering from...

878
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,323
some kind of hostage syndrome.

879
01:11:14,334 --> 01:11:16,539
Red has been a very
important man in my life.

880
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:20,120
Oh, now he's not a “fecal-faced,
great white shark.” - Shh. Shh.

881
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:22,940
I don't know where she got that.

882
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:28,441
Eh? Huh? Honey?

883
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:33,049
All right, what's goin' on here?

884
01:11:33,118 --> 01:11:36,217
- Who is this?
- Uh, that's the dog trainer.

885
01:11:38,206 --> 01:11:40,988
- I thought he was working for us?
- Yeah. Well-

886
01:11:41,054 --> 01:11:44,404
- uh, there seems to be a
little gray area there, Red.

887
01:11:45,438 --> 01:11:47,293
Come over here. I
wanna talk to you.

888
01:11:52,670 --> 01:11:55,768
Mr. Layls-

889
01:11:55,837 --> 01:11:58,773
I just wanna say that...

890
01:11:58,845 --> 01:12:01,496
although you're in the category
of a person that I admire...

891
01:12:01,565 --> 01:12:06,835
you've gone to some lengths on this thing
here that I don't entirely agree with.

892
01:12:06,909 --> 01:12:11,896
I have a neck condition that aggravates
me to have to look up at you. Sit down.

893
01:12:14,237 --> 01:12:17,106
Okay. No problem.

894
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:20,508
But I wanna finish my
thought on this...

895
01:12:20,572 --> 01:12:24,118
Because, you know, I'm not
In the best of health rlght

896
01:12:24,188 --> 01:12:27,636
and I've been advised
to avoid excitement.

897
01:12:27,708 --> 01:12:31,058
So if you intend to do that,
I might just have to have...

898
01:12:31,132 --> 01:12:35,125
some of my more effective
personnel blow your brains out.

899
01:12:35,196 --> 01:12:37,531
Furthermore, this sensitive man

900
01:12:37,595 --> 01:12:40,867
Not only kept you in a stupor for three
weeks, but now he's trying to forbid you...

901
01:12:40,891 --> 01:12:42,471
from publishing your book
the way you want to.

902
01:12:42,482 --> 01:12:43,013
I know.

903
01:12:43,036 --> 01:12:46,331
And I told him I'm extremely
pissed off about it.

904
01:12:47,355 --> 01:12:49,210
Could someone please
get me my clothes?

905
01:12:49,275 --> 01:12:52,057
Sturge, more sugar.

906
01:12:52,123 --> 01:12:56,117
Lust for a moment, put yourself
in the shoes of a man“.

907
01:12:56,187 --> 01:13:00,279
Whose sole intention is to leave the
world a better place than he found it...

908
01:13:00,347 --> 01:13:04,210
only to discover those intentions
have been painfully slandered...

909
01:13:04,283 --> 01:13:08,920
by someone he had given both his
heart and his economic support to-

910
01:13:08,986 --> 01:13:10,841
not to mention his trust.

911
01:13:10,906 --> 01:13:11,994
Mm-hmm. - Harry...

912
01:13:11,995 --> 01:13:13,850
Mm-hmm. - Harry...

913
01:13:13,915 --> 01:13:15,802
I cannot believe you
are sitting there...

914
01:13:15,866 --> 01:13:19,281
nodding your head and having a
tea party with these crooks.

915
01:13:19,354 --> 01:13:22,901
I'm not nodding my head, honey.
I'm just listening to the man.

916
01:13:25,882 --> 01:13:30,291
Who is this guy anyway? I mean,
isn't he a little sleazy, Joahie.7

917
01:13:30,362 --> 01:13:33,231
Lewie was a bit of a stiff... You're
going to talk to me about sleaze...

918
01:13:33,306 --> 01:13:36,154
when you consorted with
some maniac tree surgeon...

919
01:13:36,217 --> 01:13:39,251
who was flicking his tongue out
at me like some rutting iguana...

920
01:13:39,322 --> 01:13:41,941
and groping at his naturel
at 3:00 in the morning.

921
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:45,687
- Oh. Him.
- Him? he might have come at me with an ax.

922
01:13:45,753 --> 01:13:47,924
Well, he's very immature.

923
01:13:47,993 --> 01:13:52,565
Miss Spruance, would you like a nice glass
of iced tea? - No, thank you. Excuse me.

924
01:13:52,633 --> 01:13:56,626
I don't know what kind of spell you cast
on my sister, but it doesn't extend to me.

925
01:13:56,697 --> 01:13:59,665
In fact, I've been to the police and I
intend to press charges against you.

926
01:13:59,737 --> 01:14:01,986
- He's not to get excited.
- Not only for burglarizing my apartment-

927
01:14:02,009 --> 01:14:04,279
but for breaking into
Andy's house and...

928
01:14:04,344 --> 01:14:06,963
for hiring somebody to harass,
intimidate and frighten me.

929
01:14:07,032 --> 01:14:08,887
- Maybe you better not start-
- No, damn it.

930
01:14:08,952 --> 01:14:11,287
Honey, he's got a bad neck.

931
01:14:11,352 --> 01:14:14,418
I am not afraid of these
snakes, Harry, What is it?

932
01:14:14,488 --> 01:14:17,337
Dr Park is on the line for
you, Tell him to hold on.

933
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:21,710
First of all, I had nothing whatsoever
to do with your supposed misfortune.

934
01:14:21,784 --> 01:14:25,809
And as regards Andy's house, I'd have
no need to break into Andy's house...

935
01:14:25,879 --> 01:14:27,734
because I own Andy's house.

936
01:14:27,799 --> 01:14:32,109
Oh, really? Well, just a few minutes ago,
he admitted... No, I didn't admit anything.

937
01:14:32,183 --> 01:14:34,092
You liar.

938
01:14:34,167 --> 01:14:38,444
Young lady, I have never much cared for
you, and I find your display of anger...

939
01:14:38,519 --> 01:14:40,756
both unattractive
and unfeminine.

940
01:14:40,823 --> 01:14:44,882
Hey, now wait a minute... I am not
here to beg your good opinion...

941
01:14:44,951 --> 01:14:46,773
or to find the right amount
of attractiveness...

942
01:14:46,785 --> 01:14:47,936
Don't insult this individual.

943
01:14:47,959 --> 01:14:50,446
- That I'm supposed to render up.
- Get it? Huh?

944
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:53,301
Loanie, will you please stop
interfering in my personal life.

945
01:14:53,366 --> 01:14:56,447
I want to go to the yacht and get a little
color back. - Do you know something?

946
01:14:56,471 --> 01:14:59,602
The kind of woman you are is a
danger to the kind of woman I am.

947
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:01,525
- We found one for you.
- Keep your voice down.

948
01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:03,716
So the next time that
you and your boyfriend

949
01:15:03,728 --> 01:15:05,485
have a domestic spat,
don't call me.

950
01:15:05,558 --> 01:15:08,079
If you're going to take this grumpy
attitude, I certainly won't.

951
01:15:08,118 --> 01:15:09,973
Harry, where are my clothes?

952
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:12,319
- The pericardium is a gorgeous color.
- They must be outside.

953
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:14,579
- Don't rush me on “YB, Monroe.
- Would you get them?

954
01:15:14,646 --> 01:15:18,192
There's nothing for you to say. It's
very clear where your priorities are.

955
01:15:18,261 --> 01:15:20,433
All I have been
doing from day one-

956
01:15:20,502 --> 01:15:24,178
Well, I want a hell of a lot more
information before you start carving me up.

957
01:15:24,246 --> 01:15:26,962
- I don't be we erg/specifics"
- Believe that? - I don't.

958
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:28,978
The host was around
35, and was obviously

959
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:31,089
very healthy... Yeah.
Wait a minute, Monroe.

960
01:15:31,157 --> 01:15:35,150
Goddamn it, I told you I
don't want a woman's heart.

961
01:15:35,221 --> 01:15:38,123
Hmph. - Don't worry, It's not
going to change you in any way.

962
01:15:38,197 --> 01:15:40,947
Never had a heart.
Heartless thug,

963
01:15:41,013 --> 01:15:43,315
In other words, you
don't trust me.

964
01:15:43,381 --> 01:15:46,332
- Would you please get my clothes?
- And I just wanted to tell you before...

965
01:15:46,356 --> 01:15:50,284
that I was privileged to see you perform
on the Fourth of July at the Bowl.

966
01:15:50,356 --> 01:15:52,593
You can't tell me what
kind of a woman she was?

967
01:15:52,661 --> 01:15:56,175
And if she was so goddamned
healthy, why is she dead?

968
01:15:56,245 --> 01:15:59,921
I was particularly moved by your rendition
of“The Battle Hymn of the Republic."

969
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:04,692
Mine eyes have seen the coming of the
glory of the lord - Never mind that shit.

970
01:16:04,756 --> 01:16:10,092
Just tell her. Did I spend your money?
Did I give you any services for it?

971
01:16:10,164 --> 01:16:14,703
Just tell this woman the truth
you son of a bitch. Huh? - Fine.

972
01:16:14,772 --> 01:16:17,674
Yeah. - Why don't I start with the
fact that you're a married man...

973
01:16:17,747 --> 01:16:20,334
and go on from there?

974
01:16:20,404 --> 01:16:22,990
Jesus Christ! What are
you trying to do to me?

975
01:16:25,075 --> 01:16:26,812
Honey, wait a minute. Wait.
You know whose

976
01:16:26,824 --> 01:16:28,572
heart this body snatcher's
tryin' to give me?

977
01:16:28,595 --> 01:16:30,734
The hostess at some
place called Denny's.

978
01:16:30,759 --> 01:16:32,871
This is the doctor you
recommended to me.

979
01:16:32,872 --> 01:16:36,392
- Get outta here.
- I'll be glad to.

980
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:40,014
You're killin' me, Monroe. You know that?
You're drivin' me to the goddamned wall.

981
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:49,038
Joan. Joan! There's a perfectly
good-Here. Thank you.

982
01:16:49,106 --> 01:16:53,198
Honey, there's a very simple
explanation for all this.

983
01:16:53,266 --> 01:16:56,202
If you loved me-

984
01:16:56,275 --> 01:17:00,978
I tried to... tell you
tonight at dinner.

985
01:17:01,042 --> 01:17:04,751
Just listen to me for
one minute, please?

986
01:17:04,817 --> 01:17:08,975
It's very complicated.

987
01:17:25,937 --> 01:17:29,101
You know, you live
a life, honey...

988
01:17:30,128 --> 01:17:32,518
you make mistakes...

989
01:17:32,593 --> 01:17:37,099
and maybe you get married
for mutual benefits or...

990
01:17:37,168 --> 01:17:41,839
business considerations that are
weighing you down at the time.

991
01:17:43,728 --> 01:17:47,885
You don't think the right person is gonna
come along. - I would never knowingly...

992
01:17:47,952 --> 01:17:49,993
have become involved
with a married man.

993
01:17:50,064 --> 01:17:51,974
I know.

994
01:17:53,712 --> 01:17:58,121
That's why I went out and tried to
tell ya... I don't want to discuss it.

995
01:17:59,632 --> 01:18:02,087
And you know, I bet you
never read Dante either.

996
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,510
Well, now, there
you're 75% wrong.

997
01:18:07,248 --> 01:18:11,111
You know, I can't believe you would lie
to me about a thing like this, Harry.

998
01:18:12,367 --> 01:18:15,597
Okay. I lied to ya. Didn't
you ever tell a lie?

999
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:22,567
Wait.

1000
01:18:22,639 --> 01:18:24,843
Wait.

1001
01:18:24,911 --> 01:18:29,133
Can I call you up tomorrow just
to see how you're feeling?

1002
01:18:29,198 --> 01:18:32,047
To see how...
everything's going?

1003
01:18:32,111 --> 01:18:34,926
I have a dress rehearsal tomorrow
and a concert on Friday...

1004
01:18:34,991 --> 01:18:37,129
and that's all I care
about right now.

1005
01:18:39,918 --> 01:18:43,268
And I don't want to
see you anymore.

1006
01:18:43,342 --> 01:18:46,408
Oh, don't say that, please.

1007
01:18:46,478 --> 01:18:49,031
I'm asking you...

1008
01:18:49,102 --> 01:18:52,746
to give me a chance to clear these
things out of my life, because I-

1009
01:18:52,814 --> 01:18:57,549
No! No. I did not extricate myself
from the infidelities of one man“.

1010
01:18:57,614 --> 01:19:00,549
To fall into the arms of the
prince of prevaricators.

1011
01:19:04,077 --> 01:19:06,762
Well...

1012
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:11,685
I might be all kinds of a son of a
bitch, and the prince of whatever...

1013
01:19:11,757 --> 01:19:14,180
but that doesn't mean that when
it came right down to it...

1014
01:19:14,253 --> 01:19:17,189
that I wouldn't stand up and
take the bullet for you.

1015
01:19:18,221 --> 01:19:21,003
That's not what I
observed, Harry.

1016
01:19:38,636 --> 01:19:41,572
60, Duke.

1017
01:20:10,699 --> 01:20:13,667
Harry?

1018
01:20:13,739 --> 01:20:17,482
- I want my dog.
- Lee. How are ya?

1019
01:20:17,547 --> 01:20:20,034
- Okay.
- I just this minute got back from Vegas.

1020
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:24,962
I'm dealin' a couple of dogs to Paul Anka.
Just about to call ya.

1021
01:20:25,035 --> 01:20:28,646
Well, don't embarrass us both, man.
Just gimme the dog back, and...

1022
01:20:28,714 --> 01:20:30,569
let's preserve the friendship.

1023
01:20:32,042 --> 01:20:35,108
Lee, I'm in the neighborhood of
gettin' my hands on the money.

1024
01:20:35,178 --> 01:20:39,171
I'm on the verge of closin' a business deal
with Bart Soluthian. Soluthian Carpets?

1025
01:20:39,241 --> 01:20:42,406
You heard of him? - Come on, Harry. I
know these dodges backwards and forwards.

1026
01:20:42,474 --> 01:20:46,086
Now, I need the dog.
He's up for a TV series.

1027
01:20:46,154 --> 01:20:50,628
I don't even want the 10,000 now,
compared to what he might appreciate.

1028
01:20:50,698 --> 01:20:54,975
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but our
agreement was I could buy the dog back.

1029
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:58,018
All I'm askin' for is a couple
of days while I navigate a loan.

1030
01:20:58,089 --> 01:21:00,359
Don't make me have to get
legal with you, Harry.

1031
01:21:00,425 --> 01:21:03,011
You sold me the animal,
and as a personal favor.

1032
01:21:03,081 --> 01:21:07,239
I let you borrow him to demo to some V.I.P.
who probably don't even exist.

1033
01:21:07,305 --> 01:21:10,087
You haven't been
straight with me, man.

1034
01:21:10,153 --> 01:21:12,739
Duke, get in. Get in, Duke.

1035
01:21:13,704 --> 01:21:16,552
Duke.

1036
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:24,103
Hey, why don't you
take this dog, Harry?

1037
01:21:24,168 --> 01:21:26,404
He's green, but you can
probably do something with him.

1038
01:21:26,472 --> 01:21:29,374
- No, I don't want the dog.
- Oh, come on. Take him.

1039
01:21:29,448 --> 01:21:33,987
You don't want him? Pick up some change.
Sell him for a pet.

1040
01:21:38,472 --> 01:21:40,959
Excuse me.

1041
01:21:42,344 --> 02:43:24,687
Do me one favor, will ya?

1042
01:21:42,344 --> 01:21:42,364
Do me one favor, will ya?

1043
01:21:42,365 --> 01:21:44,885
Say “owner“ if you want to...

1044
01:21:47,065 --> 01:21:50,295
but don't say “trainer.“
I trained that dog.

1045
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,750
Want me to have to
repaint my rig, Harry?

1046
01:22:16,408 --> 01:22:17,815
They caught the
Westside Slasher.

1047
01:22:17,816 --> 01:22:18,880
They caught the
Westside Slasher.

1048
01:22:18,903 --> 01:22:20,813
No kidding, the Slasher?

1049
01:22:24,088 --> 01:22:25,997
Pete, they got the
Westside Slasher.

1050
01:22:26,072 --> 01:22:28,437
Joan, a couple of us are
gonna go grab a bite.

1051
01:22:28,448 --> 01:22:30,775
You wanna join? No, thanks.
I'm not hungry.

1052
01:22:30,839 --> 01:22:34,287
- Uh, how are you gonna get home?
- Call a cab?

1053
01:22:34,359 --> 01:22:39,030
Oh, no. Eddy. Eddy, could you give
Joan a ride home? - Yeah, sure.

1054
01:22:39,095 --> 01:22:41,793
Great. All right, honey.
See you tomorrow.

1055
01:22:41,804 --> 01:22:42,707
Bye.

1056
01:22:42,775 --> 01:22:46,354
Is this yours? - Yeah.

1057
01:22:46,423 --> 01:22:49,489
That “3”passage. That's
what / keep forge rang.

1058
01:22:49,559 --> 01:22:52,014
Watch your step. - Oh, thanks.

1059
01:23:31,509 --> 01:23:36,561
Do you remember when we were
on tour in Japan, in '88-

1060
01:23:36,629 --> 01:23:40,240
the night after we gave
a concert in Osaka?

1061
01:23:41,268 --> 01:23:43,472
Could you be more specific?

1062
01:23:45,012 --> 01:23:47,729
We had a few drinks
in your room...

1063
01:23:47,796 --> 01:23:51,059
and a certain
intimacy took place.

1064
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:56,755
When I asked if I could see you the
next night, you know what you said?

1065
01:23:57,940 --> 01:24:00,427
You said you were too tired.
You were sleepy.

1066
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:03,501
That was witty of me.

1067
01:24:03,572 --> 01:24:05,427
But you weren't.

1068
01:24:07,412 --> 01:24:10,043
'Cause an hour later you went into
Lewie's room. You didn't come out.

1069
01:24:10,067 --> 01:24:13,133
If you remember, I was in love
with Lewis around that time...

1070
01:24:13,203 --> 01:24:15,953
which I confided to
you, so you did know.

1071
01:24:16,019 --> 01:24:18,441
That's not the reason.

1072
01:24:20,851 --> 01:24:23,438
Eddy, you just passed the
turnoff to my street.

1073
01:24:25,907 --> 01:24:30,217
Eddy. - I just want to drive
around a little so we can talk.

1074
01:24:30,291 --> 01:24:33,040
Get outta here.

1075
01:24:35,507 --> 01:24:38,954
You know, if I remember
correctly, we only kissed.

1076
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:45,521
If that led you to believe
something that hurt you, well...

1077
01:24:45,586 --> 01:24:47,441
I apologize.

1078
01:25:35,889 --> 01:25:39,882
You know, I used to think
very highly of you.

1079
01:25:39,952 --> 01:25:41,807
But now I don't like what I see.

1080
01:25:41,872 --> 01:25:43,832
Eddy, I don't really know
what you're talking about.

1081
01:25:43,856 --> 01:25:47,370
There are so many things about
me that you have no idea of.

1082
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:50,670
Because you don't ask. Because you
have no interest. - That's not true.

1083
01:25:50,736 --> 01:25:55,145
Creative things and...
feelings...

1084
01:25:55,215 --> 01:25:59,012
and certain depths that no one
else in your life is capable of.

1085
01:25:59,087 --> 01:26:02,950
Eddy, you can tell me anything you want to.
You know that.

1086
01:26:03,024 --> 01:26:06,668
No. No.

1087
01:26:06,735 --> 01:26:09,866
I just want to sit
here quietly...

1088
01:26:09,935 --> 01:26:13,831
until I figure out
what's wrong with you.

1089
01:26:13,903 --> 01:26:17,220
And then... I want
you to kiss me.

1090
01:26:17,295 --> 01:26:19,946
Okay.

1091
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:26,052
What is this? What are
you doin' with this-

1092
01:26:50,893 --> 01:26:53,578
- Duke.

1093
01:26:56,205 --> 01:26:59,107
Duke! Rays! Rays!

1094
01:26:59,181 --> 01:27:02,924
Go get Harry! Go! Go on. Go get Harry!
60, Duke!

1095
01:27:06,701 --> 01:27:08,458
Duke! Oh!

1096
01:27:20,461 --> 01:27:23,494
Are you crazy?

1097
01:27:23,564 --> 01:27:28,103
What are you doin' hangin' around with
a guy like this? - This is the LA.P.D.

1098
01:27:28,172 --> 01:27:30,758
- What are you people doing down there?
- You maniacs!

1099
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:33,415
You-You liars!

1100
01:27:33,484 --> 01:27:35,492
- Ha'.
- What are you people doing down there?

1101
01:27:35,564 --> 01:27:38,532
You shits! You creeps!

1102
01:27:38,604 --> 01:27:44,070
What are you yellih' at me for? This
guy might be the Westside Slasher!

1103
01:27:44,139 --> 01:27:47,457
- Oh, the Westside Slasher.
- That's right.

1104
01:27:47,531 --> 01:27:51,656
They caught the Westside Slasher.
He's a friend of mine.

1105
01:27:51,723 --> 01:27:54,257
This guy's a friend of yours?
I thought he was,

1106
01:27:54,268 --> 01:27:56,644
but none of you are
friends of mine.

1107
01:27:56,715 --> 01:28:00,708
I'm finished wagging my tail and
leaving little puddles on the floor.

1108
01:28:00,779 --> 01:28:03,594
Smiling on command... Now,
wait a minute, honey.

1109
01:28:03,659 --> 01:28:06,441
Because I don't give a damn whether
any of you like me or not.

1110
01:28:06,507 --> 01:28:09,802
I repeat, this is the Los
Angeles Police Department.

1111
01:28:09,867 --> 01:28:12,256
Shut up! - Ma'am. Ma'am?

1112
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:16,258
Kiss this. We can't
hear you, ma'am,

1113
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:18,501
Ma'am, is this guy
bothering you?

1114
01:28:18,571 --> 01:28:21,986
I'm not bothering her!
I love her!

1115
01:28:25,578 --> 01:28:29,670
I love her.

1116
01:28:31,882 --> 01:28:34,184
Stay where you are, and
put down the knife.

1117
01:28:36,169 --> 01:28:40,610
Put down the knife, Harry.
Just give me that thing.

1118
01:28:40,681 --> 01:28:45,668
Give me the knife, Harry. See? He's
not bothering me. He's my friend.

1119
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:49,381
- Looks like a domestic quarrel to me.
- Yeah, we better stick around.

1120
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:51,785
That's what I am: your friend.

1121
01:28:51,849 --> 01:28:56,006
That's how I feel, honey.
That's how I feel.

1122
01:28:56,073 --> 01:29:00,711
That's what-That's what I came up here to
say, and then I see you with this guy.

1123
01:29:02,761 --> 01:29:06,853
I just wanna tell you
in my own words.

1124
01:29:06,921 --> 01:29:10,238
I need for you to know
this one other thing...

1125
01:29:10,313 --> 01:29:14,208
about me, because I-I don't wanna
withhold anything from you anymore.

1126
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:17,182
What is it? Oh, God, no. No.
I-I don't wanna know.

1127
01:29:17,256 --> 01:29:20,518
Okay. - Okay. What is it?

1128
01:29:26,376 --> 01:29:29,126
My real name isn't Harry.

1129
01:29:29,192 --> 01:29:31,462
It's Eugene.

1130
01:29:34,216 --> 01:29:36,289
'Eugene'

1131
01:29:37,319 --> 01:29:39,807
I love that name.

1132
