barrister specializing in divorce why he
could have much more exciting time at

00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,460
the criminal bar defending murderers
perhaps he doesn't want to defend

41
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,120
murderers
perhaps he'd rather see them hang I

42
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,240
can't say that I approve of divorce
hey Don I showed her whatever Gilbert

43

wife was wearing a bridge brooch yes

119
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:49,419
cameo brooch

sir sit down okay I have to ask you a

122
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,789
few questions
I can't believe it I just can't believe

123
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:19,720
it I know I'm I'm sorry when did you
last see your wife alive um mr.

124
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,440
Ainsworth I'm asking you when did you
last see your wife alive I know it's

125
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,130
sudden but we must have your help in
tracing her movements today yes yes I'm

126
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:33,539
trying to think it was about teatime we
had tea together
she was then going round to see a friend

127
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,150
of Miss Heywood about five o'clock so
she's had she left the house about

128
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:47,590
quarter to 4:00 hind I didn't see her
again until so now why do you say or so
she said had you reason to suspect she

129
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,780
was lying
then he'd certainly not but in few of

130
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,340
what happened I'm wondering we can see
miss Hayward later

131
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:01,040
can you think of anyone who might want a
Harley away and of course not she was

132
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,860
very friendly with everyone can you
think of any reason why she should have

133
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,760
been on the heath after dark
had she friends in that neighborhood I

134
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,350
can't think of any you live on the other
side of the heath when you say the other

135
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:17,180
side to which side you refer but I
naturally don't know in which direction

136
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,140
my wife was walking but I think I'm safe
in saying that we have many friends who

137
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,280
live close to the heath on any sign what
were you doing between teatime and 9

154
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:17,710
goodbye I could see them in the distance
the two of them my first impulse was to

155
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:22,450
beat man's brains out and I started
often then I start to got hold of myself

156
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,160
I thought perhaps he isn't her lover
perhaps there's some other explanation I

157
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:29,920
decided to wait till she got home and
Challenger I see what she had to say I

158
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,580
got back into the car I meant go
straight home but I couldn't I drove out
along a bit North Road held forever then

159
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:45,520
I stopped after a bit i cooled off and
turn around and I drove home I didn't

160
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:55,210
kill her Gilbert I know that Robert was
a grateful thing well it's it's

161
00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:00,250
unbelievable Carolyn I told the police I
was at your flat from quarter past six

162
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,850
to nine o'clock with you I was taking a
chance on your being there but why

163
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,940
didn't you tell him the truth what you
told me how could I

164
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:12,400
I was there when it happened they would
have arrested me on suspicion please

165
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,710
back me up I know it's a lot to ask
no it isn't that after all you've done

166
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:24,670
for me in the last 15 years it's not
that it is I I don't think it's wise

167
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:28,630
Robert I can't go back to the inspector
now and tell him I was lying no I see

168
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:36,330
that fortunately I was at home all
evening so it is a possible alibi
all right I agree yes I'll do it but our

169
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,550
stories must agree

170
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,690
well any prints the man may have made
the rains washed out yeah there's

171
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,730
nothing much to show up in this rough
grass anyway

172
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:01,480
only the imprints of a heeled seems to
come up from the road to the pond then

173
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,290

hard the way she was talking about

174
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,560

then she got lost in the dark I will

175
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,130

thoroughly and I want that pond dragged

obliged comes he wanted that he's after

177
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,810

something would incriminate him he took

178
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,530
a lot to cover up

179
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,109

200
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,350

Ainsworth gave me permission to take try
again was given well the keys always

201
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:22,780
kept in their little silver box did she
keep a diary no she was much too careful

202
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,740
careful and secretive mm-hmm
she was a very contradictory person so

203
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:35,570
spontaneous in some ways and so discrete
in others it was a letter you were

204
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:40,040
looking for wasn't it miss Hayward Oh
from I was afraid she might have kept

205
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,270
something I didn't want mr. Ainsworth to
see my you wanna protect him who was the

206
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:49,190
man I didn't know there were so many but
if you think Robert found out murder did

207
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:53,169
because mr. Ainsworth has an alibi miss
Hayward I don't question it should I

208
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:56,720
mrs. Ainsworth had an appointment with
you at 5 o'clock yesterday it was the

209
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,940
six not five all right six did she turn
him

210
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,870
no but that's nothing unusual she was
apt to change her plans without telling
people though actually in this case I

211
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:10,210
was rather surprised because because
well she rang me late on Friday night

212
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:15,350
she sounded frightened she said you must
see me it was urgent and then she hung
up as if she'd been interrupted oh by

213
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,390
her husband was it him she was afraid of
no of course who else would interrupt

214
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:34,580
her antenna hmm I don't know two hundred
pounds
Lucy you'll never have any money she was

215
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:40,820
so extravagant she was always in there

216
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:58,160
that's a receipt didn't have been
extravagant doesn't feel Devine in debt

217

be able to tell you shall we go morning

00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,290
flat about the time of the murder did
you notice anything unusual about his

223
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:38,770
appearance or manner no accepted he
appear to be a little valiant possibly

224
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:42,520
about the business nettles he called to
discuss weight was me if it's not a

225

of making a very sizable loan to a small

226
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,600
European young indeed we'd gone through
files to commit ourselves then argument

Office did notice the bruise on his

228
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,309
forehead bruise come mr. Morgan you
couldn't fail to see that mr. Ainsworth

229
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:05,020
had no bruise when he called my dad I
understand he did he just had later on

230
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,220
leaving oh no in his car it's very easy
to do if you're preoccupied over it you

231
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,740
mustn't waste your time mr. Ainsworth
he's not the type of man to commit a

232
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:17,440
crime like this you admire him yes I do
very much indeed mrs. Ainsworth

233
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:24,040
you can rely on my discussion mr. Morgan
I don't admire her in the manner which

234
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,910
we imply since she's dead I prefer to
speak no I love her more than that I'm

235

00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:31,720
Wade you go from there Hampstead Heath
sheer coincidence I went to the

Spaniards it's quite a distance from
where she was killed you know I got

305

somebody can probably vouch for that I'm
well-known there how did you go I walked

306
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:48,420
up West Hill ran by Hampstead Lane I
mean it sort of half circle hurry don't

307
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:53,320

the south instead into the norm past

308
00:37:53,320 --> 00:38:01,060
near not too busy st. reticular yeah but
not in time I couldn't have got from the

309
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:04,500
coffee stall to that particular spot in
time to kill her

310
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,220
try it and see don't worry we shall
anyway it seems someone mattered and

311
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:14,830
Kilda my successor I presume did I name

she's dead

314
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:31,780
she obsessed with that I couldn't live
without her she had everything and

315
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,370
nothing
she looked passionate she was sexist she
had the face of truth she didn't know

316
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:50,320
the meaning of the word
she was an illusion nothing one day I

317
00:38:50,320 --> 00:39:10,870
start to miss him your face he's alright
I know whom Lucilla saw on Saturday a
man called Frank King an artist we've

318
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:17,170
been in contact
unfortunately the inspector turned up in

319
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:22,000
the middle of it you knew she was seen
this man didn't John I didn't know who

life
she's associating with a married man if

323
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:42,040
this does not stop the writer will take
further steps which will cause trouble

324
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,940
and unhappiness for all concerned
have you shown it in the inspector how

325
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,990
can I gives me a motive but it gives the
rider a motive - Robert you must tell
him the truth I can't but you can't

326
00:39:52,090 --> 00:40:02,970
suspect you anyway you're with Gilbert

if you didn't why not he's out for

333
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:35,199
promotion or justice I don't believe
that at least he's honest and he's no

334
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,349

[Music]

458
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:20,170
why did you kill her I didn't kill her
you were on the heath mr. Morgan we

459
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:24,760
tested your overcoat we found dust and
goss pollen Hou did I live up there I

460
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:27,340
often walk on the heath and so do a lot
of other people too

461
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:31,120
why were you trying to lead the country
I'm trying to help Robert preserve his
alibi which is false isn't it but you

462
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:35,590
weren't going for a few days mr. Morgan
you were going for good and you were

463
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:42,520
taking half the bank we get you're a
thief of nothing worse if you weren't

464
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,400
blind about the code why did you try to
get rid of it because I knew who you

465
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,660
were looking for a dark grey overcoat
how how did you know I read in the paper
some threads were found in Lucille's

466
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:55,120
needle threads yes but how do you know
they came from the coat like that only

467
00:52:55,120 --> 00:53:01,200
the police knew that and the murderer
you met her on the 8th engine

468
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:07,780
yes I did but I didn't kill her I just
met her I was only with her for a few

469
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:17,110
minutes what's she blackmailing you
yes you see I well some years ago I

470
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:21,280
embezzled money from the bank I meant to
pay it back indeed I could have done so

471
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,600
but Lewis Hill discovered this and
threatened to expose me if I didn't
settle her debts for him she ruined my

472
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:31,990
life for her constant demands and
threats for money why did you tell her
to keep it quiet

473
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:37,030
I didn't kill her I met her on the heath
yes I met her to give her the money I

474
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:40,030
suddenly decided that I wouldn't give it
to her I told her I haven't got it she'd

475
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:42,750
wait she'd have to wait she was
absolutely furious

476
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:46,540
she again threatened to expose me to
Robert but I am I said I didn't care a

477
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:50,350
damn what she did
I got beyond caring so I went away and I

478
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:53,890
left her all I wanted to do is to get
out of the country before she had time

479
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:57,640
to give me away it was a struggle mr.
Morgan she told your coat her nails were

480
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:02,770
broken I know she didn't want me to
leave her I pushed her off with my hand

481
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:08,170
a cat didn't scratch her hand she
scratch it into you no I scratched my

482
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:13,020
hand on the pin of a brooch she wasn't
wearing abrupt but she was wearing it I

483
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:17,470
never
painten headed Robert tell me that but I

484
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:20,110
couldn't tell you that she was wearing
it could I without revealing where I was

485
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:34,680
with her there is a stain on it but that
doesn't prove a thing

486
00:54:35,850 --> 00:54:41,020
Franklin must have give me back to her
he must have he went back gave her back

487
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:45,490
the brooch then he hung around waiting
to see who she was meeting anyway later

488
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:49,930
on the way to the road Ronald river and
strangled her but why did he take the

489
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:58,330
brooch back again hmm because he'd been
seen with a brooch earlier at the coffee

490
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:05,620
store if the birch was found on her body
it proved he'd seen her again how did he

491
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:08,430
get there in time

492
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:19,499
