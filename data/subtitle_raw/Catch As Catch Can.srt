1
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,724
THE UNLEASHED
AKA CATCH AS CATCH CAN

2
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,490
Hey!

3
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,271
No! No!

4
00:01:51,813 --> 00:01:54,948
Excellent! Ready, girls?
It's your turn! Hurry!

5
00:01:55,028 --> 00:01:56,760
And shout all together! Go!

6
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:03,006
Quick! Quick!
Everybody happy, smiling!

7
00:02:03,086 --> 00:02:04,463
Come forward like that!

8
00:02:04,543 --> 00:02:07,161
This way please!
Serenity! Happiness!

9
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:09,595
Look towards the camera!
The slogan!

10
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:12,325
The man who wins
drinks HAG Coffee!

11
00:02:12,552 --> 00:02:16,728
HAG Coffee: no caffeine,
for a peaceful sleep and…

12
00:02:16,986 --> 00:02:18,394
nerves of steel!

13
00:02:18,957 --> 00:02:21,731
With HAG Coffee,
my heart knows no fear.

14
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:25,079
Good, keep smiling.
Look in the camera! Keep looking!

15
00:02:26,906 --> 00:02:29,799
But he's…!
- Stop! Excellent. Very good.

16
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:31,840
Very good. No, it's great.

17
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:33,856
Fantastic! Truly fantastic!

18
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:35,710
Excellent, my foot!

19
00:02:37,276 --> 00:02:40,037
But that dog…!
- Don't worry, he was out of frame.

20
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:43,416
Are you crazy? Didn't you see
what he did? He pissed on me!

21
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,889
I cut it above here.

22
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:48,641
Fine but
he broke my concentration.

23
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:53,795
Listen, Bob, it was great!
- He upset my facial equilibrium.

24
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,292
Oh, no! Just watch the screening.

25
00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:59,818
You may be right but,
excuse me, I'd like to do another.

26
00:02:59,898 --> 00:03:01,298
It was disgusting.

27
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:04,302
I'm going to change.

28
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:07,869
Hey, can you tell me
where that dog came from?

29
00:03:07,949 --> 00:03:10,995
I'll go ask, <i>Dottore</i>.
- Yes, ask everybody, investigate.

30
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,824
Whose dog was that?

31
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:17,463
Who knows?
- Whose dog was it?

32
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:20,045
Whose dog was that?

33
00:03:26,003 --> 00:03:28,028
Nobody knows whose dog it is?

34
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:31,309
Let's do another rehearsal!
Come now! Action! Shout!

35
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:37,038
That's it, very good!
Come forward, smiling!

36
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:47,236
Well…

37
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,760
Hey!

38
00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:09,598
Hey! What's going on here?

39
00:04:09,678 --> 00:04:11,743
Who put a chicken in my trailer?

40
00:04:11,823 --> 00:04:13,574
Who knows, <i>Dottore</i>?
- But…!

41
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:18,514
This is cr…!
This place is turning into a zoo!

42
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:20,913
First a dog, now a chicken!

43
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,870
I'm done, eh?
I'm not working anymore today!

44
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,977
Nobody makes fun of me!

45
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:31,254
A hen!

46
00:04:45,044 --> 00:04:47,866
In short, someone must tell me:

47
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:50,946
Who the hell does that dog
and chicken belong to?

48
00:05:42,987 --> 00:05:46,242
You can rest assured that
even in the worst of trouble,

49
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:50,073
Bulova never stops!

50
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,959
That was great, dear.

51
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,139
No, it went badly and you know it.

52
00:06:35,883 --> 00:06:37,446
Why?
- Disgusting!

53
00:06:37,526 --> 00:06:39,683
I was supposed to get
a close-up not the horses!

54
00:06:39,763 --> 00:06:41,781
Here, dear, on my face!

55
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,251
Bob, what's the matter tonight?

56
00:07:05,404 --> 00:07:06,604
Nothing.

57
00:07:07,835 --> 00:07:10,258
You've been working
too hard lately.

58
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:11,655
Relax.

59
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,667
You hear that?

60
00:07:16,253 --> 00:07:17,553
What?
- Listen.

61
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:22,913
Do you hear that?

62
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:37,221
But what's the matter, dear?

63
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:40,784
Luisa, some very strange things
are happening to me.

64
00:07:40,864 --> 00:07:42,064
Like what?

65
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,831
I don't know…

66
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:45,261
I don't know why…

67
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:49,313
but it's clear they got
something against me.

68
00:07:49,755 --> 00:07:51,151
I'm talking about…

69
00:07:51,468 --> 00:07:52,668
the animals!

70
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:56,265
That's just a fancy. Relax.

71
00:07:56,539 --> 00:07:59,239
You're just reliving
your persecution mania again.

72
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,793
No, no! Believe me,
it's been going on for a while!

73
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,264
Today, for example.
- What happened?

74
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:08,816
First there was that dog…
disgusting…

75
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,349
afterwards the hen and…

76
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:14,080
Don't think about it.
- And… and you know…

77
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:18,493
you know why the commercial
didn't end with my usual close-up?

78
00:08:18,573 --> 00:08:21,208
Why?
- Because I had to get on horseback.

79
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:23,622
But every time,
I got on its back…

80
00:08:25,328 --> 00:08:26,628
he threw me off.

81
00:08:27,213 --> 00:08:28,413
8 times!

82
00:08:29,549 --> 00:08:32,940
Try to get some sleep now.
Want me to get you a tranquillizer?

83
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,937
Drop it!
I don't need your tranquillizers!

84
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:56,638
Wait here.

85
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:02,598
One moment!

86
00:09:03,154 --> 00:09:04,354
There you go.

87
00:09:06,483 --> 00:09:09,233
Is my face relaxed?
- You look great, honey.

88
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,886
My eyes?

89
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:13,280
Very clear.

90
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,418
My teeth?
- Bright.

91
00:09:33,676 --> 00:09:37,095
The cows are in place!
Don't step on the grass!

92
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,198
Hello!

93
00:09:39,394 --> 00:09:41,489
Hey, why are there cows here?

94
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:43,486
Do we really need animals?

95
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:45,997
They make the shot richer. More…

96
00:09:46,077 --> 00:09:48,205
But they weren't expected!
Where's my agent?

97
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:51,231
Is Toni here? Where is he?
- In the trailer. - Luisa!

98
00:09:51,311 --> 00:09:54,412
Luisa, excuse me, see if Toni's here.
Tell him to come here.

99
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:57,087
Of course, right away. Toni!
- Yes?

100
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:58,982
Toni, hurry, Bob wants you.

101
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,683
Hi, Bob!
- Listen, please.

102
00:10:01,763 --> 00:10:04,083
How many times have
I said that I don't want

103
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:06,721
any animals in my commercials?

104
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:10,080
I don't like it!
- What do you think they are? Lions?

105
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,840
Please, they're cows.
They're nice, quiet.

106
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,765
They make me nervous.
I need to be relaxed when I work.

107
00:10:15,845 --> 00:10:17,402
Go tell them right away:

108
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:21,415
If they won't send the cows away,
then they can find another actor.

109
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,092
Make it clear. Go on!

110
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:28,394
It's incredible!
- If there are animals, he can't…

111
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:30,811
But I can't…
- Come on, try.

112
00:10:31,512 --> 00:10:32,904
Get rid of the cows!

113
00:10:33,712 --> 00:10:36,043
Take away the cows!

114
00:10:38,232 --> 00:10:39,432
Well then?

115
00:10:40,492 --> 00:10:42,049
It's all OK.

116
00:10:42,495 --> 00:10:43,695
Go on!

117
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,521
I'm sorry but
we all have our principles.

118
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:51,096
Oh, it's nothing.
It's probably for the best.

119
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:54,199
It'll be a faster shoot.
- It'll be less vulgar.

120
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,005
You stand here and when you're
in the shot, you say the slogan.

121
00:10:58,085 --> 00:11:00,465
"Montana, choice meat all week."

122
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:02,002
A little background, eh?

123
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:03,845
A fast pace.
- I prefer slow, thanks.

124
00:11:03,925 --> 00:11:05,909
Get ready to shoot!
The girls in their places!

125
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:09,105
Get ready to shoot!
The girls in their places! Come on.

126
00:11:09,764 --> 00:11:10,964
Easy!

127
00:11:12,162 --> 00:11:15,352
Come on, you can do it.
- It's nice up here.

128
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:17,150
Yes, step up.

129
00:11:17,618 --> 00:11:20,153
Come on. Sit down.
- Yes.

130
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:22,920
Sit on this side.
A little more this way.

131
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,738
Should I smile?
- How do I know?

132
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,277
I'll smile.

133
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:31,017
Alright, guys, we're filming!
Some slow music!

134
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:33,956
Now we're starting.
- Thank God.

135
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:37,096
Everybody in their place, please!
We're filming! Silence!

136
00:11:37,325 --> 00:11:38,490
The music!

137
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:47,215
Attention!

138
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,599
Ready?

139
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,818
Camera!
- Started!

140
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,588
The clapperboard.

141
00:11:57,871 --> 00:11:59,936
Clapperboard!
- Montana no 1!

142
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:03,864
That's it. Wait. Action!
- Action!

143
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:06,796
Keep tight on the girl.
- Alright.

144
00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:10,960
A panorama. Just like that.
- You got him? Good.

145
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:13,017
Montana!

146
00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:14,618
Montana…

147
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:29,475
What the hell is he doing?

148
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,778
Help!
- The bull is coming!

149
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:35,022
The bull! Beat it!

150
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,720
Bob!

151
00:12:48,915 --> 00:12:50,189
Help!

152
00:12:51,864 --> 00:12:53,959
Help!

153
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,020
Bob! Help!

154
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:01,292
Watch out!
- Help!

155
00:13:01,523 --> 00:13:03,111
It's turning!
- Help!

156
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:10,559
Keep running! Turn it!
- Give me a hand!

157
00:13:11,492 --> 00:13:13,510
Turn it!
- I am turning!

158
00:13:13,942 --> 00:13:15,342
Keep up the pace!

159
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:17,810
Keep turning!

160
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,030
Go on!

161
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:31,320
Sorry if I pushed you!

162
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,062
That's the way!
- Yes!

163
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:42,233
Watch out, it's spinning!

164
00:13:43,504 --> 00:13:45,906
Yes!
- Sorry for pressing you!

165
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,123
Sorry.

166
00:17:34,015 --> 00:17:37,660
Come, stop it, Luisa, please!
Leave me in peace.

167
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:42,659
WALTER FLAX:
CLEANS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM

168
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,240
No way, Bob.

169
00:17:50,387 --> 00:17:54,110
After the incident with
the corned beef people,

170
00:17:54,713 --> 00:17:55,963
we're finished.

171
00:17:57,073 --> 00:17:58,327
What do you mean?

172
00:17:58,407 --> 00:18:00,530
Is it my fault that
a bull got mad and…

173
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,733
No, I know. Of course.

174
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:04,462
The bull.

175
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:07,104
But they're starting to say…

176
00:18:07,184 --> 00:18:10,496
that these strange accidents
only happen to you.

177
00:18:10,576 --> 00:18:12,074
You know how it is…

178
00:18:12,154 --> 00:18:15,350
But there's always Dr Bellini,
the one with men's cosmetics.

179
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,112
He keeps calling us.

180
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:19,291
No way.

181
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:22,979
We're finished with him too.
- Listen…

182
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:24,227
Watch out!

183
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:29,242
Impossible. He calls every day.

184
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,719
Then try calling him yourself.
Here!

185
00:18:32,171 --> 00:18:35,354
What are you doing? Go now!
That's fine. Good.

186
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,160
Come here!

187
00:18:40,363 --> 00:18:41,563
Let's see.

188
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,474
No…

189
00:18:43,554 --> 00:18:44,754
Not bad.

190
00:18:44,932 --> 00:18:46,870
Yes, yes. Turn around.

191
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,737
Hello, Mr Bellini?

192
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:51,029
This is Bob Chiaramonte.

193
00:18:52,035 --> 00:18:53,158
Sure.

194
00:18:55,912 --> 00:18:57,112
What?

195
00:18:58,061 --> 00:19:00,488
He has no time? Thank you.

196
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,349
I told you:
this is a difficult time for you.

197
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:05,959
You're no longer riding high, Bob.

198
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,520
Wait for me in there.
- Yes, thanks.

199
00:19:10,054 --> 00:19:12,743
You think I'm on my way out?
- I'll be with you soon.

200
00:19:12,823 --> 00:19:14,829
Please, don't make me…!

201
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,543
Don't make me laugh.
I know my face sells.

202
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:22,625
It has saved industries from
bankruptcy more than once.

203
00:19:23,753 --> 00:19:26,898
Bob, there are only three shorts.
One with horses.

204
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,753
The other with a tiger.
- A tiger?

205
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,874
And if you like,
a commercial for Swiss cheese.

206
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:37,477
But I warn you:
there'll be difficult aerial shots.

207
00:19:37,557 --> 00:19:40,320
You must fly over Rome
hanging from a helicopter.

208
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:42,828
Everybody else refused to do it.

209
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:45,351
And do you think I would accept?

210
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:47,467
Never!

211
00:19:59,795 --> 00:20:02,631
Uncover your face,
we can't see you!

212
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:09,919
OK! Let's make this quick!
It's heavy!

213
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:13,207
Stay right there! Say the slogan!
- OK!

214
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,769
Delicate and light:
the super Gruyère!

215
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:19,282
Made of milk, cream, pure air…

216
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,000
It's full of rats!

217
00:20:24,305 --> 00:20:25,505
Get away!

218
00:20:27,136 --> 00:20:28,336
Get away!

219
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:32,084
Shoo!

220
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:35,038
What are you doing?
- Eh, what am I doing?

221
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,806
There! The rope! The mice!

222
00:20:59,596 --> 00:21:00,916
They're eating it!

223
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:03,554
Chase the mice away!

224
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,424
Help!

225
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:45,483
Up! Up!

226
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,760
Stay up!

227
00:23:10,137 --> 00:23:12,474
Hey? Is anybody there?

228
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:30,225
Bed!

229
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,425
Bed!

230
00:23:42,027 --> 00:23:44,123
Come in! Alone!

231
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,592
Down there!

232
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,982
Down there!

233
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,981
Ma'am?

234
00:24:06,642 --> 00:24:07,842
Ma'am?

235
00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:11,602
Emma! ​​Her name is Emma!
- Thanks.

236
00:24:12,313 --> 00:24:13,627
Thank you very much.

237
00:24:16,104 --> 00:24:18,715
Emma! Mme Emma!

238
00:24:18,795 --> 00:24:21,120
Wake up. Come on, be good.

239
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,430
Mouth to mouth!

240
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:41,779
Mouth to mouth!

241
00:25:06,093 --> 00:25:09,081
What is it? Go away now.
- More!

242
00:25:09,449 --> 00:25:12,828
More! Mouth to mouth!

243
00:25:12,908 --> 00:25:16,069
Go away. I get it.

244
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,178
Mouth to mouth! Mouth to mouth!

245
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,480
All done!

246
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,325
Poldo, what are you playing at?
Let me sleep.

247
00:26:08,405 --> 00:26:09,605
Cuckold!

248
00:26:13,814 --> 00:26:17,753
Are you sure your husband's asleep?
- Of course, dear, like a rock.

249
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,469
He is not asleep.

250
00:26:22,245 --> 00:26:23,491
Hi, how are you?

251
00:26:23,571 --> 00:26:25,555
The hell with that!
What are you doing here?

252
00:26:25,635 --> 00:26:28,128
I saved her. She was drowning.
- Yes.

253
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:29,356
A lie!

254
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,905
A lie? Stupid beast, you didn't…

255
00:26:32,985 --> 00:26:34,185
Kiss!

256
00:26:34,547 --> 00:26:36,073
Sir…
- Kiss!

257
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:38,514
I was passed out.
- That's right!

258
00:26:38,594 --> 00:26:40,860
And I gave her
artificial respiration.

259
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,140
Lie!

260
00:26:42,746 --> 00:26:44,921
I'll kill you both!

261
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:48,572
Oh, no! You know, honey,
that Poldo is so jealous!

262
00:26:48,652 --> 00:26:50,076
Let go of me!

263
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,760
Damn you! Where are you going?
Where are you running off to?

264
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,300
Come here!

265
00:26:57,423 --> 00:26:58,761
Scoundrel!

266
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:01,629
No, dear, come back, please!

267
00:27:01,876 --> 00:27:04,196
Damn beast! Now, tell the truth!

268
00:27:04,276 --> 00:27:06,835
Here's the gentleman.
Say, what did I do to the lady?

269
00:27:06,915 --> 00:27:08,052
Kiss!

270
00:27:08,132 --> 00:27:11,143
No but… No! Listen!
Do you believe…?

271
00:27:12,143 --> 00:27:16,287
You think I'm a cheap seducer,
but it's not true! I'm a professional.

272
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:19,478
I ended up here by chance.
An accident while working.

273
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,204
After all, I saved your wife!
- Rascal!

274
00:27:26,502 --> 00:27:28,238
Stop! Stop!

275
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,880
That's my eye.

276
00:27:37,043 --> 00:27:38,623
Yes, it's my eye.

277
00:27:38,938 --> 00:27:41,338
And my ear.
- Come on, this is heavy!

278
00:27:46,522 --> 00:27:49,501
Hey! Tell me what you're doing?
Where are you taking me?

279
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:52,933
How should I know?
He told us to take it down. Let's go.

280
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,131
Check this stuff out…

281
00:28:06,211 --> 00:28:08,532
What a face!
- I don't like him.

282
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:10,684
He doesn't even know
how to smile!

283
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,307
Please!

284
00:28:12,922 --> 00:28:14,799
And then he's so forced.

285
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,662
No style at all.

286
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,720
It doesn't worry me at all.

287
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,500
He'll never make it big.

288
00:28:24,032 --> 00:28:25,232
Poor thing.

289
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:29,851
Hey! Hey!

290
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:32,161
They're taking apart my face!

291
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,200
What the…?

292
00:28:45,753 --> 00:28:46,953
My whole face…

293
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:00,701
Let's go.

294
00:29:01,254 --> 00:29:02,454
Come away.

295
00:29:29,412 --> 00:29:33,834
Since childhood, you can say
I grew up with advertising.

296
00:29:33,914 --> 00:29:35,725
Here I am at 4, 5 years old.

297
00:29:35,901 --> 00:29:38,934
It went with me
throughout my growth.

298
00:29:39,014 --> 00:29:41,691
Here I am 8 years old and
then when I was grown up,

299
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:44,522
I showed more diverse
and complex expressions,

300
00:29:44,602 --> 00:29:47,776
naturally for the profession:
love, tenderness,

301
00:29:47,856 --> 00:29:49,612
sympathy, joy.

302
00:29:49,692 --> 00:29:51,100
My portfolio.

303
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,917
Here I'm smiling. Serious.

304
00:29:54,144 --> 00:29:56,045
Profile. Pajamas.

305
00:29:56,217 --> 00:30:00,029
Here I have a worried expression
because I forgot my keys.

306
00:30:00,336 --> 00:30:04,046
This is very important because
it increased sales by 30%.

307
00:30:04,126 --> 00:30:07,360
Notice here the smile:
open, easy and functional.

308
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,620
Above all, the gamut of expressions,
often even severe.

309
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,129
We see this a lot because
it's often very effective.

310
00:30:14,209 --> 00:30:18,240
My eyes are very photogenic.
This series, I may say,

311
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,686
caused a sensation.

312
00:30:19,766 --> 00:30:22,621
It was talked of abroad.
No, excuse me, allow me!

313
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:24,401
Here, I'm drinking beer.

314
00:30:24,601 --> 00:30:26,203
Here I'm playing tennis.

315
00:30:26,378 --> 00:30:27,911
Very multifaceted.

316
00:30:28,805 --> 00:30:32,178
I have the right expression
for every occasion.

317
00:30:32,258 --> 00:30:34,130
Perhaps, I might be of use?

318
00:30:34,474 --> 00:30:37,078
Sure, let's see what can be done.

319
00:30:38,763 --> 00:30:41,553
Well then, are we ready?
Can we start?

320
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,158
Then let's go!

321
00:30:43,238 --> 00:30:45,270
Turn up the 10000s! Go on!

322
00:30:45,772 --> 00:30:47,539
You, say the slogan. Go on.

323
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:50,640
Cebion: an armor against colds!

324
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,770
No, repeat it.

325
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,956
Cebion: an armor against colds!

326
00:30:56,296 --> 00:30:57,496
Who did that?

327
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,280
Who was it?

328
00:31:00,164 --> 00:31:01,987
Who was it?

329
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,820
Excuse me a moment.
- By all means.

330
00:31:10,748 --> 00:31:13,677
You do some work too.
Are you my agent or not?

331
00:31:13,884 --> 00:31:17,197
It's won't be easy.
There are many new faces about.

332
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,795
Let's be honest, Bob:

333
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:21,840
The last 5 ads you've made
have been a disaster.

334
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,870
It certainly wasn't my fault.
- Yeah, of course.

335
00:31:32,988 --> 00:31:34,936
He's coming! Not so close!

336
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:38,349
How are you?
- A pleasure.

337
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,353
Well then, let's take a look.

338
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:43,434
Now then…

339
00:31:45,266 --> 00:31:47,815
Yes, yes. The hand is fine.

340
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:51,240
I'll use it for a close-up. OK?

341
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:53,434
What the hell did he just say?

342
00:31:53,514 --> 00:31:55,341
He's interested in your hands.

343
00:31:55,878 --> 00:31:57,428
And my face? My body?

344
00:31:57,508 --> 00:31:59,555
Just the hands.
What's wrong with that?

345
00:31:59,635 --> 00:32:02,785
What's wrong? I'll never
accept such a humiliation.

346
00:32:05,144 --> 00:32:07,339
Try to convince him.
It's important for him.

347
00:32:07,418 --> 00:32:08,877
Innocenti Mini T:

348
00:32:08,902 --> 00:32:12,075
Cute like a mini,
practical like a truck.

349
00:32:12,155 --> 00:32:15,186
What's humiliating?
Hands are in high demand:

350
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,720
gloves, cigarettes…
- Accept it, Bob, do.

351
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,815
It'll be great publicity.
- Listen to me well:

352
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:23,647
I well know that when one goes
from the face to the hands,

353
00:32:23,727 --> 00:32:25,542
it means your profession is over!

354
00:32:25,622 --> 00:32:28,718
It's sure money. You'll regret it later.
- Please, accept it.

355
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:32,816
Never! Bob Chiaramonte won't do it!
Got it? Never!

356
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,676
Come in. The hand.

357
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:39,248
The slogan.
- The flame is beautiful…

358
00:32:39,328 --> 00:32:41,676
Just like that.
- Soft… - Go!

359
00:32:41,756 --> 00:32:45,045
Solange enters.
Raise your hand higher.

360
00:32:45,311 --> 00:32:46,483
Good.

361
00:32:46,563 --> 00:32:47,837
Smile, Solange.

362
00:32:48,214 --> 00:32:49,414
Go!

363
00:32:50,491 --> 00:32:52,141
Come in with your hand.

364
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:55,666
Pull back.
- Alright.

365
00:32:55,746 --> 00:32:57,608
Go towards the camera.
- Good.

366
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:59,298
Just like that.
- Good.

367
00:32:59,802 --> 00:33:01,859
Stop! OK! OK.

368
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,945
For her, for him,
to feel close together.

369
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:09,071
Tabac d'Harar:
the original eau de cologne.

370
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,221
Just like that with the hand.
Gently. Gently.

371
00:33:17,492 --> 00:33:21,184
That's it, gently…
- Look what I have to do…

372
00:33:21,264 --> 00:33:24,219
Caress her. Now on the neck.

373
00:33:24,508 --> 00:33:27,688
That's it, gently like that.
Gently… Stop!

374
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:30,833
Let's prepare another one.

375
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,921
Was that fine?
- It was fine, Chiaramonte.

376
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:36,115
Smile! Smile, Dolf! Slogan!

377
00:33:36,195 --> 00:33:40,776
Galliano: the Italian liqueur
that conquered America.

378
00:33:40,856 --> 00:33:43,027
Good. Stop. Change the glasses.

379
00:33:43,212 --> 00:33:44,762
Let's do another one.

380
00:33:45,383 --> 00:33:48,464
Keep your hands still!
Change the colors too!

381
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,957
Hurry, boys!

382
00:33:51,203 --> 00:33:52,403
Who did that?

383
00:33:53,696 --> 00:33:57,197
I don't know, it just slipped.
You see, a hand…

384
00:34:00,585 --> 00:34:02,752
Slogan!
- Hands…

385
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,673
Find it, find it!
Some more, more!

386
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:10,603
You found it. Slowly, gently…
Gently, gently, gently!

387
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,880
Again. With love, love, love!
So much love!

388
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,395
That's it. Higher, higher.

389
00:34:17,902 --> 00:34:20,080
Now it's your turn. Caress him.

390
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,595
Again and again.

391
00:34:23,692 --> 00:34:26,798
All right, stop! This is good.
- Yeah, yeah.

392
00:34:28,682 --> 00:34:31,193
Keep still.
Keep the arm motionless!

393
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,918
Go with the slogan!
- Perfect even under water,

394
00:34:34,998 --> 00:34:39,776
Veglia Swiss Watches: set by
the masters of Swiss watchmaking.

395
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:43,598
Stop! OK! Fine, Chiaramonte.

396
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,023
Slogan!
- My favorite Ambrosoli Honey:

397
00:35:23,103 --> 00:35:26,138
absolutely pure, 100% from bees.

398
00:35:26,304 --> 00:35:28,063
That's good like that. Stay still.

399
00:35:28,143 --> 00:35:30,341
Raise the hand higher. Higher.
Stay still!

400
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:32,924
That's it, still.
- A bee? Bees!

401
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:37,195
Stop, don't move!
Keep shooting, this is good!

402
00:35:38,522 --> 00:35:40,518
Don't move your hand! Stay still!

403
00:35:57,232 --> 00:35:59,624
I'm ruined, Professor! Ruined!

404
00:35:59,704 --> 00:36:02,301
I've tried everything:
perfumes, deodorants…

405
00:36:02,465 --> 00:36:06,315
I thought I had a smell that was
bothering them but nothing worked!

406
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,847
I did all the blood tests: nothing.
Everything's normal.

407
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:13,069
No one can give me an explanation.

408
00:36:13,218 --> 00:36:16,761
Tell me the truth:
do you despise animals?

409
00:36:16,972 --> 00:36:19,287
Are you afraid of them?

410
00:36:19,656 --> 00:36:22,070
I'd say I'm indifferent.

411
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:26,075
Sometimes, I'm afraid after what
has happened. I've lost my job

412
00:36:26,155 --> 00:36:29,097
That's what is pushing
them to be aggressive.

413
00:36:29,644 --> 00:36:30,911
Think about dogs.

414
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,240
Dogs?

415
00:36:35,689 --> 00:36:38,791
But I don't understand, Professor.
In what way?

416
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,960
Dogs attack those who aren't sure
of themselves and are afraid.

417
00:36:43,457 --> 00:36:47,407
That's why you're an individual who
brings out the aggression of animals.

418
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,515
What do you think I should do?

419
00:36:59,365 --> 00:37:00,565
Kill some of them.

420
00:37:02,406 --> 00:37:03,606
Be terrible.

421
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,326
Come see what I'm working on.

422
00:37:21,871 --> 00:37:23,071
Come!

423
00:37:28,693 --> 00:37:29,893
This way.

424
00:37:33,578 --> 00:37:36,754
I keep them in the dark or
they won't work. Assist me.

425
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:45,539
Ants.

426
00:37:46,881 --> 00:37:49,878
I hold about 1 million prisoners.

427
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,683
And what are you doing?
Studying them?

428
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,030
That as well.

429
00:37:59,436 --> 00:38:02,790
If you agree,
I'll give you a fine book to read.

430
00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:05,887
It could be
very useful in your case.

431
00:38:55,391 --> 00:38:57,832
IDIOT

432
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:09,560
Professor! Professor, come!
Come quickly! Come see!

433
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:12,950
Look there! They wrote a word…
- What was it?

434
00:39:14,983 --> 00:39:17,134
But before they were… were…

435
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,074
They were…

436
00:39:21,688 --> 00:39:22,893
But they…

437
00:39:23,393 --> 00:39:25,259
It's strange, they were…

438
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,555
Here.
- Thank you.

439
00:39:31,525 --> 00:39:32,808
They lined up…

440
00:39:41,654 --> 00:39:45,736
Ah, no! No, look, no.
This is a bit too much, believe me.

441
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,960
Excuse me. Excuse…
Thanks all the same!

442
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:22,145
Sir, do you want
to see a striptease?

443
00:40:22,225 --> 00:40:24,316
What?
- Striptease.

444
00:40:24,396 --> 00:40:26,762
But… but where? Here?
- Here.

445
00:40:26,934 --> 00:40:29,905
No, look, I…
- Not me. Look.

446
00:40:29,985 --> 00:40:32,971
You can choose:
Swedish, French and black.

447
00:40:33,051 --> 00:40:35,075
Photographs don't interest me.

448
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:38,230
Hey, wait, you don't understand.

449
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,141
This is only a catalogue.

450
00:40:40,352 --> 00:40:42,942
You can see the striptease
with a telescope.

451
00:40:43,022 --> 00:40:45,885
Only 500 lire per token.

452
00:40:45,965 --> 00:40:48,631
What do you mean?
What are you doing? Look I…

453
00:40:48,711 --> 00:40:51,099
Look, you're making a big mistake.

454
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:54,236
I'm not the type you think.
I have never… have…

455
00:40:57,714 --> 00:41:00,154
Would that be the French one?
- Yes.

456
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,862
Shoo! Go away!
A fly is getting in the way.

457
00:43:06,438 --> 00:43:09,440
Damn it! Let's start again…

458
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,278
Go. Go away!

459
00:43:15,816 --> 00:43:18,395
Damn you! Go away!

460
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,227
Go away! Where did she go?

461
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,997
Where did she go? I lost the view.

462
00:43:48,967 --> 00:43:51,556
It's over.
- I couldn't see. There was a fly.

463
00:43:51,636 --> 00:43:53,864
It's over. I'm sorry.

464
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,529
Thank you. There it is!

465
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,800
Hey, but…

466
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
But…?

467
00:45:14,572 --> 00:45:15,791
What is it?

468
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:17,803
Hold still! I'm not after you!

469
00:45:18,054 --> 00:45:21,121
It's a fly, persecuting me.
It's a conspiracy. Keep still!

470
00:45:21,201 --> 00:45:22,771
Who?
- All the animals!

471
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,016
What do you mean?

472
00:46:00,134 --> 00:46:01,480
Excuse me, Reverend!

473
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,061
I didn't mean to hit you.
It's the fly chasing me!

474
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,188
Why… why?
- I'm not against priests!

475
00:46:06,278 --> 00:46:08,612
The fly is chasing,
persecuting me!

476
00:46:08,702 --> 00:46:12,128
I'm a good Christian, Father!
I'm baptized… There it is!

477
00:46:12,218 --> 00:46:16,270
You hear it buzzing? It's the fly!
- There he is! There!

478
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,560
Stop!

479
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,266
Stop!

480
00:46:20,691 --> 00:46:21,891
Stop!

481
00:46:24,495 --> 00:46:26,395
My daughter, why? Thank you.

482
00:46:34,595 --> 00:46:37,318
I'm asking you again
for the last time.

483
00:46:37,674 --> 00:46:40,424
You insist on giving
that version of events?

484
00:46:43,295 --> 00:46:45,514
Fine, if that's what you want.

485
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,719
But remember, every word
you say will be taken down.

486
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,757
Write it all.

487
00:46:52,988 --> 00:46:54,288
I said write it!

488
00:46:55,476 --> 00:46:57,925
A FLY

489
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,829
Where did you first see it?

490
00:47:03,377 --> 00:47:06,710
I already told you.
On the telescope lens.

491
00:47:06,895 --> 00:47:09,429
And what were you looking at?
- The view.

492
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,980
Be more precise!

493
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:12,739
A dome.

494
00:47:13,298 --> 00:47:16,193
And the fly landed on the dome?
- Exactly.

495
00:47:16,896 --> 00:47:20,549
And did you run after the fly
or did it run after you?

496
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,318
No, I was running after it.

497
00:47:31,921 --> 00:47:34,644
And how do you justify
slapping the priest?

498
00:47:35,003 --> 00:47:37,474
I only wanted to hit the fly.

499
00:47:38,494 --> 00:47:41,412
I told you, I respect priests.
I'm Catholic.

500
00:47:46,273 --> 00:47:47,493
Give it here.

501
00:47:47,775 --> 00:47:49,320
Come on! Be snappy!

502
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,387
Tear it up.
Else they'll think we're nuts.

503
00:48:15,053 --> 00:48:18,355
Go away.
I hope I never see you again.

504
00:48:19,286 --> 00:48:21,398
Good day.
- One moment!

505
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,710
Wanna see how a man with
his head on his shoulders behaves?

506
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:52,509
See, Commissioner?

507
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,896
That one is mine.

508
00:49:57,584 --> 00:49:59,849
Go away! Go away!

509
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:01,543
Get out!

510
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,403
Close the door!

511
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,160
The door!

512
00:50:09,739 --> 00:50:10,991
The door!

513
00:50:11,081 --> 00:50:12,281
The door!

514
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,395
Shut up and go away!

515
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:48,470
This time I got you, right?

516
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:50,995
Try to go to away, Ma'am!

517
00:50:51,357 --> 00:50:53,931
There it is…

518
00:50:54,674 --> 00:50:58,797
Go away, I'm talking to the fly.
Lady, shut up!

519
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,861
I need to crush it!

520
00:51:05,173 --> 00:51:06,373
Got you!

521
00:51:08,747 --> 00:51:09,947
Damn you!

522
00:51:16,638 --> 00:51:18,521
I'll wipe you out!

523
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,880
Why?

524
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,753
Why did you do it, Bob?

525
00:52:14,643 --> 00:52:16,714
Bob, tell me why you did it.

526
00:52:20,376 --> 00:52:21,565
What?

527
00:52:21,731 --> 00:52:24,129
Don't pretend with me,
it's no use.

528
00:52:24,379 --> 00:52:25,812
It's all over the papers.

529
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,240
Look.

530
00:52:28,221 --> 00:52:31,950
OUT OF WORK ACTOR ATTEMPTS
SUICIDE WITH INSECTICIDE

531
00:52:32,171 --> 00:52:34,021
It's not in the least true!

532
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:37,195
I wasn't trying to commit suicide.

533
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,685
I only wanted to kill it!

534
00:52:39,775 --> 00:52:42,013
Do you understand? And I will!

535
00:52:42,103 --> 00:52:45,150
Of course. Keep calm.
- I'll kill it!

536
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:49,022
Forget commercials.
I found you a good job in TV.

537
00:52:49,112 --> 00:52:51,110
Keep calm. Sleep.

538
00:55:43,314 --> 00:55:45,629
Damn it, it's shit!

539
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:22,466
Good day!
- Good day.

540
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,825
Whom do you want to speak to?

541
00:56:32,915 --> 00:56:34,541
With the director.

542
00:56:36,031 --> 00:56:37,231
Very well.

543
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:38,919
This way.

544
00:56:39,009 --> 00:56:41,519
This way! Over here!

545
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,463
Over here!

546
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:52,986
Over here!

547
00:57:01,072 --> 00:57:03,044
Whom should I announce?

548
00:57:05,134 --> 00:57:07,465
Ah… Bob Chiaramonte.

549
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,320
You may enter…

550
00:57:21,465 --> 00:57:24,477
Sorry, I thought…
I didn't see him.

551
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,760
Ah, lions!

552
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,173
You may come in.

553
00:57:46,842 --> 00:57:49,149
Please sit down.
- Thank you.

554
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,986
How can I help you?

555
00:57:51,322 --> 00:57:52,492
Thank you.

556
00:57:55,952 --> 00:57:59,613
My name…
My name is Bob Chiaramonte.

557
00:58:00,004 --> 00:58:04,311
And… unfortunately,
as you can see,

558
00:58:04,495 --> 00:58:06,870
I'm persecuted by animals.

559
00:58:07,311 --> 00:58:10,671
I don't know if I'm the only one
and therefore the first…

560
00:58:10,761 --> 00:58:13,577
to be targeted but there must be…

561
00:58:13,757 --> 00:58:16,960
There must be…
there must be a solution…

562
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,245
a solution…

563
00:58:20,507 --> 00:58:23,624
But I… find it rather…
rather strange, I'd say…

564
00:58:23,714 --> 00:58:25,560
a mistake… that…

565
00:58:25,725 --> 00:58:28,987
that you yourself protect…
your enemies.

566
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,064
Go on, continue.

567
00:58:31,154 --> 00:58:34,230
Now I see!
Now I finally understand.

568
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:36,169
What do you understand?

569
00:58:36,498 --> 00:58:38,031
That you're in cahoots!

570
00:58:38,121 --> 00:58:41,102
You're all in cahoots!
All of you are against me!

571
00:58:41,192 --> 00:58:42,956
Of course, you're in cahoots!

572
00:58:43,116 --> 00:58:45,550
Because you're all
the same like them!

573
00:58:45,775 --> 00:58:47,914
Now I know I can't count on you!

574
00:58:48,004 --> 00:58:51,184
Because you're not with me
but with them! You're their ally!

575
00:58:55,043 --> 00:58:57,382
You are their accomplices!

576
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,869
Bound together!

577
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,518
Luisa!

578
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,285
Luisa!

579
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,936
Free me! Will you untie me?

580
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,592
Excuse me,
are you Bob Chiaramonte?

581
01:00:16,153 --> 01:00:18,241
Uh, listen, just one thing…

582
01:00:18,331 --> 01:00:21,565
I haven't gotten the script yet.
Do you know what role is about?

583
01:00:22,266 --> 01:00:24,390
I see there is a misunderstanding.

584
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,390
I'm sorry but
you must get up from this chair.

585
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:31,792
You… you were recommended
to us but as a make-up artist.

586
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,096
As a makeup artist?

587
01:00:39,443 --> 01:00:41,043
But I'm an actor! I'm…

588
01:00:41,868 --> 01:00:43,068
I'm an artist.

589
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:48,754
Sorry, makeup is an art too but…
- It's a fine job.

590
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:53,390
Actors, ministers, journalists:
they all pass through here.

591
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,670
If you're good, you can make this
a trampoline for your acting career.

592
01:00:57,992 --> 01:01:00,804
But I'm already an actor.
I… I couldn't…

593
01:01:00,894 --> 01:01:05,191
I assure you that this is
an excellent opportunity for you.

594
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,026
No, I… I…

595
01:01:07,792 --> 01:01:08,954
No.

596
01:01:09,044 --> 01:01:10,244
Never.

597
01:01:31,836 --> 01:01:35,185
Just one second.
I want to help the eyebrow arch.

598
01:01:51,686 --> 01:01:52,886
Yes.

599
01:01:55,597 --> 01:01:56,797
There we go.

600
01:02:02,913 --> 01:02:04,113
There.

601
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:10,492
Ready. Please, take a look.

602
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:15,181
One moment…
- Thank you.

603
01:02:15,271 --> 01:02:17,350
Haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

604
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:23,110
Yes, perhaps…
It's very likely, Minister Sir.

605
01:02:23,279 --> 01:02:25,364
I'm Bob Chiaramonte, the actor.

606
01:02:25,454 --> 01:02:29,270
You may've seen me on TV:
I was in many commercials and series.

607
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,318
Touch up my mustache too, please.
- Yes, Sir

608
01:02:33,496 --> 01:02:36,347
If you permit it,
Minister, I would…

609
01:02:36,437 --> 01:02:38,350
I'd like to ask you a great favor.

610
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:41,567
Could you put in
a good word for me?

611
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:44,458
My work here's a stopgap, you see.

612
01:02:44,548 --> 01:02:47,596
I'd really like to go back
to my true calling: acting.

613
01:02:47,686 --> 01:02:51,129
Like I said, I'm an actor.
I did classic theater, cinema.

614
01:02:51,219 --> 01:02:53,840
I have truly
excellent qualifications.

615
01:02:54,066 --> 01:02:56,194
Exceptional, if I may say so.

616
01:02:56,658 --> 01:03:01,696
Good diction, physique, I know
how to move. I can speak several…

617
01:03:02,127 --> 01:03:05,929
several languages: English,
Italian, French <i>naturellement</i>.

618
01:03:06,683 --> 01:03:09,875
My Spanish
<i>es muy natural y simple para mí</i>…

619
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:16,434
Get away!

620
01:03:16,524 --> 01:03:20,280
So I'm sure,
Minister Sir, that for you…

621
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:23,308
it would… it would be easy…
Get away!

622
01:03:23,398 --> 01:03:26,081
Minister, you might be able to

623
01:03:27,067 --> 01:03:28,267
Minister?

624
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,560
Minister?

625
01:03:32,989 --> 01:03:34,289
Get out of here!

626
01:03:38,769 --> 01:03:40,095
Go away!

627
01:03:40,185 --> 01:03:43,103
You nasty devil's fly!

628
01:03:50,896 --> 01:03:52,101
Damn you…

629
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:53,510
Damn you!

630
01:03:54,923 --> 01:03:57,064
How can I work…

631
01:03:57,154 --> 01:04:00,819
with this nasty disgusting fly!

632
01:04:07,827 --> 01:04:09,027
Minister Sir!

633
01:05:02,944 --> 01:05:05,388
Here… here you go.

634
01:05:05,478 --> 01:05:07,121
Please, look here.

635
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,732
Perfect.
- Thank you very much, Excellency.

636
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,783
Excuse me.

637
01:05:18,737 --> 01:05:19,937
Minister Sir.

638
01:05:21,661 --> 01:05:24,094
Excuse me for one moment.

639
01:05:24,305 --> 01:05:25,555
One last touch.

640
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:40,081
Check the focus.
- Check the focus.

641
01:05:43,152 --> 01:05:44,384
Ready?
- Ready

642
01:05:44,474 --> 01:05:45,757
Go.
- Go!

643
01:05:46,773 --> 01:05:47,973
If you please.

644
01:05:50,005 --> 01:05:51,205
Good evening.

645
01:05:52,186 --> 01:05:54,748
I know that a large part
of the Italian population

646
01:05:54,838 --> 01:05:56,911
are waiting for my statement.

647
01:05:58,382 --> 01:06:01,670
The only way not to
disappoint this expectation,

648
01:06:01,975 --> 01:06:04,162
is to avoid words…

649
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:06,838
and to move right on

650
01:06:06,928 --> 01:06:10,911
to the figures made
available by the government.

651
01:06:11,516 --> 01:06:14,732
So that,
in the shortest possible time,

652
01:06:15,335 --> 01:06:17,565
the poorest masses…

653
01:06:18,449 --> 01:06:20,342
can achieve…

654
01:06:20,702 --> 01:06:23,659
the standard of living they expect

655
01:06:23,749 --> 01:06:26,186
in a society like ours…

656
01:06:26,374 --> 01:06:27,844
based on…

657
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:29,840
on work,

658
01:06:30,971 --> 01:06:32,349
on freedom,

659
01:06:33,502 --> 01:06:34,800
on democracy.

660
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:36,830
Well, he's rather handsome.

661
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:43,243
1,200 billion for the…

662
01:06:43,533 --> 01:06:45,633
…ion.
- Sorry, what did he say?

663
01:06:45,723 --> 01:06:48,402
Maybe "ocean"?
- Speculation.

664
01:06:50,319 --> 01:06:56,834
722, 800, 000, 000.05…

665
01:06:57,950 --> 01:06:59,969
for the …ion.
- What did he say?

666
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:03,270
For "construction"?
- No, for "seduction".

667
01:07:03,472 --> 01:07:07,916
499,000,000,000…

668
01:07:09,575 --> 01:07:10,643
…onated.

669
01:07:10,733 --> 01:07:12,398
What shit is he saying?

670
01:07:12,488 --> 01:07:16,283
254,000,000…

671
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:17,850
…onated.

672
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:20,970
This…

673
01:07:21,869 --> 01:07:23,119
the government…

674
01:07:24,068 --> 01:07:25,468
does and prepares…

675
01:07:26,549 --> 01:07:27,949
for those in need.

676
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:32,318
1,250,000,000.

677
01:07:32,678 --> 01:07:37,019
And I allow myself to
emphasize this impressive figure…

678
01:07:38,465 --> 01:07:40,272
for public works.

679
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:44,277
And there mustn't be,
there won't be new tax provisions.

680
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:50,270
We know that the people cannot.

681
01:07:50,745 --> 01:07:53,510
We will hit the wealthy classes.
- Mustache!

682
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:57,625
It's well that the Italians know
and the nation remembers…

683
01:07:57,789 --> 01:07:59,510
that we will not allow it!

684
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,859
A hand? From whom?

685
01:08:02,051 --> 01:08:04,464
Who is that? What are they doing?

686
01:08:04,554 --> 01:08:07,424
Shall we interrupt?
- What will we do? What?

687
01:08:07,514 --> 01:08:09,693
… the only general good.

688
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,926
There's no denying that when…

689
01:08:14,016 --> 01:08:16,953
and in this case especially,
reform requires…

690
01:08:17,043 --> 01:08:20,504
an absolute seriousness of purpose…
- Keep it out of frame!

691
01:08:20,594 --> 01:08:22,397
… or society falls apart

692
01:08:22,487 --> 01:08:25,189
and what can we
in the government do?

693
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:27,731
I'll put it back! Don't move!

694
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,472
What can we do?

695
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,952
We absolutely have to…help!

696
01:08:37,108 --> 01:08:40,058
Come on, put up the message!

697
01:08:40,214 --> 01:08:42,643
Do something!
- It's stuck!

698
01:08:42,733 --> 01:08:44,562
Help! Help!

699
01:08:44,652 --> 01:08:48,110
Please, let's do something!

700
01:08:49,078 --> 01:08:52,770
THE BROADCAST WILL RETURN
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

701
01:08:57,915 --> 01:09:00,770
From here,
there's no getting out alive!

702
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,273
Are you talking to me, dear?
- Shut up!

703
01:09:05,363 --> 01:09:06,755
Don't disturb me.

704
01:09:06,912 --> 01:09:08,194
I'm busy.

705
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,635
There it is! There!

706
01:09:16,925 --> 01:09:18,662
Now I'll kill you.

707
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,638
Now, my dear, you're trapped!

708
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:27,354
I'll kill you!
- Kill who?

709
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:29,924
Mind your own business!

710
01:09:30,014 --> 01:09:33,346
I'll kill whoever I feel like.

711
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,114
However I like!

712
01:09:50,969 --> 01:09:52,169
Mine!

713
01:10:26,619 --> 01:10:29,639
Damn cow, I'll kill you!
- Who's a cow?

714
01:10:29,729 --> 01:10:31,973
I'm not talking to you.
- Of course, you were.

715
01:10:32,063 --> 01:10:34,647
No! No! No! Excuse me, I'm busy!

716
01:10:35,261 --> 01:10:37,878
I've never been called a cow!
- Don't annoy me, please,

717
01:10:37,968 --> 01:10:41,089
there's not one moment of
peace here in this crazy house!

718
01:10:41,179 --> 01:10:43,387
Damn you!
- If you don't like it, we can move!

719
01:10:43,477 --> 01:10:45,221
It's not just the house
but everything!

720
01:10:45,311 --> 01:10:47,666
We'll change it all!
- Please, shut up!

721
01:10:48,543 --> 01:10:52,118
In the meantime, it doesn't care.
You see it? See?

722
01:10:56,672 --> 01:10:59,229
Sorry, dear, it was the fly.

723
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:17,190
Filthy! Damn…

724
01:11:17,435 --> 01:11:20,673
I get it, you know?
You hope that I'll surrender.

725
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:24,950
You'll be disappointed
if you think I'm tired!

726
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:28,119
Lazy beast!

727
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,210
You'll be disappointed!

728
01:11:30,756 --> 01:11:31,956
Idiot!

729
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,550
Where are you hiding?
I can hear you're still here.

730
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,431
I can smell you! Where are you?

731
01:11:41,611 --> 01:11:44,021
No, Bob, please, don't do it!
I love you!

732
01:11:44,111 --> 01:11:46,124
Why say that? I love you too.

733
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:47,668
Coward!

734
01:11:49,781 --> 01:11:50,981
There it is!

735
01:12:06,505 --> 01:12:08,630
Working… working… working…

736
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:11,131
I can't go on…

737
01:12:11,221 --> 01:12:12,421
like this…

738
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:24,113
I can't go on.

739
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,311
Let's get this over with.

740
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:30,117
Let's put it on a friendly level.
Let's make peace.

741
01:12:31,148 --> 01:12:34,391
I… I forgive you.
What happened is in the past.

742
01:12:34,569 --> 01:12:36,130
You'll be a guest in my house.

743
01:12:36,305 --> 01:12:38,621
You'll have food, fruit,

744
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,882
candied fruit.

745
01:12:55,758 --> 01:12:57,103
You're dead!

746
01:13:00,849 --> 01:13:03,469
Passed away!

747
01:13:04,755 --> 01:13:05,955
Kaput!

748
01:13:10,066 --> 01:13:11,357
Dead!

749
01:13:13,337 --> 01:13:14,721
Murderer…

750
01:13:16,025 --> 01:13:17,225
No!

751
01:13:18,098 --> 01:13:19,596
Not me…

752
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:24,149
Murderer!
- Dead!

753
01:13:25,081 --> 01:13:26,281
It's dea…

754
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,654
Murderer. Murderer.

755
01:13:33,744 --> 01:13:34,994
Don't touch me!

756
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:44,240
Is Bob Chiaramonte at home?
- That's me.

757
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:47,169
Just in time!
My husband tried to kill me!

758
01:13:47,259 --> 01:13:49,194
What are you saying?
Pay her no mind.

759
01:13:49,284 --> 01:13:51,990
Come and see what he did.
- Sure, make yourself at home.

760
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:54,710
Look! Look, what a disaster!

761
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,244
This is a battlefield.
- But a victorious one!

762
01:13:57,334 --> 01:14:01,355
You… you remember the fly?
I killed it.

763
01:14:01,445 --> 01:14:04,679
The fly was an excuse,
he wanted to kill me!

764
01:14:04,769 --> 01:14:07,147
Why should I…
- That's enough!

765
01:14:07,237 --> 01:14:09,904
Mr Chiaramonte,
will you answer a few questions?

766
01:14:10,076 --> 01:14:11,500
Excuse me.

767
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:31,034
Excuse me!
- Now then…

768
01:14:31,870 --> 01:14:34,149
Do you admit you threatened
the minister with a razor?

769
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:37,334
I threatened nobody.
- How can you deny it?

770
01:14:37,548 --> 01:14:39,685
10 million spectators saw it!

771
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:43,181
I admit I had a razor in my hand.
That is correct.

772
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:44,738
Now we're getting there.

773
01:14:44,828 --> 01:14:47,269
I had a razor only
to cut off his mustache.

774
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:49,218
I mean the minister's mustache…

775
01:14:49,531 --> 01:14:50,849
Oh, no…
- Got it?

776
01:14:50,939 --> 01:14:53,231
If you start that
we'll never finish!

777
01:14:55,061 --> 01:14:57,525
Which political party
do you belong to?

778
01:14:57,830 --> 01:14:59,154
None.

779
01:14:59,657 --> 01:15:02,313
Then why on TV,
were you shouting "Moscow"?

780
01:15:02,403 --> 01:15:05,157
I was referring to <i>mosca</i>.
The insect.

781
01:15:05,716 --> 01:15:06,916
A fly.

782
01:15:11,187 --> 01:15:14,950
Have you read the papers?
See what happened?

783
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,133
The government has fallen!

784
01:15:17,428 --> 01:15:18,878
All because of you!

785
01:15:22,964 --> 01:15:26,969
Commissioner, if it only takes
one fly to topple the government…

786
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,006
Never mind.

787
01:15:29,905 --> 01:15:32,174
But keep yourself available!
- Alright.

788
01:15:32,397 --> 01:15:35,473
And don't leave the city! Let's go!
- Bye, Commissioner.

789
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,692
Good day. Goodbye!

790
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,037
Just stop it!

791
01:15:46,801 --> 01:15:49,531
I am tired! Therefore…

792
01:15:51,132 --> 01:15:53,213
you better watch yourself!

793
01:15:55,642 --> 01:15:59,070
Watch yourself.
Remember what happened to the fly!

794
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:03,188
Because, you see,
even my patience has a limit.

795
01:16:03,278 --> 01:16:04,972
I can take it to a certain point,

796
01:16:05,062 --> 01:16:07,950
but I wind up uncontrolled,
then I become a hurricane!

797
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,804
And then like nothing,
I sweep away dogs, cats,

798
01:16:10,894 --> 01:16:13,070
birds, fish and anything
that gets in my way!

799
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,360
You got that?

800
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,254
And I want to tell you
one more thing.

801
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:23,239
You'll never win.
Never! Never! It's impossible!

802
01:16:23,549 --> 01:16:24,906
Because I am…

803
01:16:25,092 --> 01:16:26,596
I'm a man!

804
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:28,878
Because I have a soul!

805
01:16:28,968 --> 01:16:32,377
I'm intelligent, cunning, crafty!

806
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,109
Diabolical, if you want it!

807
01:16:36,021 --> 01:16:37,261
I'm a man!

808
01:16:37,351 --> 01:16:40,875
And an actor out of work
because of your persecution!

809
01:16:40,965 --> 01:16:43,895
Why did you do this to me?
I ask why? Why?

810
01:16:43,985 --> 01:16:46,773
Why? What do you want?
What are you?

811
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:48,130
Who are you?

812
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:52,726
You want to know? I'll tell you.

813
01:16:53,074 --> 01:16:57,029
You're nothing more than a bunch
of matter. Just nasty matter!

814
01:16:57,119 --> 01:17:01,077
Flesh and hair and nothing else!
You have nothing…

815
01:17:01,102 --> 01:17:04,731
You have no brain, intelligence,
spirit. You have nothing!

816
01:17:04,821 --> 01:17:07,376
I'll show you! Let me demonstrate!

817
01:17:13,414 --> 01:17:14,853
Here! Give me…

818
01:17:16,035 --> 01:17:17,947
Give me a little thought
about that grass.

819
01:17:18,037 --> 01:17:20,950
Go on, any whatsoever!
You can do it! Let's see!

820
01:17:21,173 --> 01:17:23,273
Let's see what you come up with.

821
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,798
What are you doing?
Are you going to eat the grass?

822
01:17:29,063 --> 01:17:33,827
Come on, a simple little thought.
Even the most basic! Go on!

823
01:17:36,664 --> 01:17:40,440
See? You can't do it!
You have nothing in here!

824
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:42,150
While I, my dear,

825
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,688
if I want I can talk
to you about it for hours.

826
01:17:44,778 --> 01:17:47,152
With a blade of grass,
I can arrive at God!

827
01:17:47,242 --> 01:17:51,742
If I want, I can recite to you
100s, 1000s of verses on grass!

828
01:17:51,832 --> 01:17:56,221
Name me one animal that wrote
a single verse on the grass!

829
01:17:56,311 --> 01:17:57,661
They don't exist!

830
01:18:00,357 --> 01:18:03,404
You're… you're so ugly!
So primitive!

831
01:18:03,494 --> 01:18:05,567
What are you doing now? Huh?

832
01:18:06,539 --> 01:18:08,831
One moment! What does that mean?

833
01:18:11,202 --> 01:18:14,417
You think though you can't talk,
you can make yourself understood?

834
01:18:14,507 --> 01:18:17,555
But here's a newsflash, my friend,

835
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,471
anything that you can do,

836
01:18:20,561 --> 01:18:24,092
I can do better!

837
01:18:26,377 --> 01:18:28,661
Remember that I'm an actor.

838
01:18:28,751 --> 01:18:33,254
My facial mobility and expressions
are practically unlimited!

839
01:18:33,344 --> 01:18:36,733
Go on, put me to the test
and I'll prove it! Don't be shy!

840
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:40,132
Oh, no, you go first.
Please, begin.

841
01:18:46,332 --> 01:18:48,436
How is this? Lower lip!

842
01:18:52,539 --> 01:18:55,574
Combination. Combination x 3!

843
01:19:02,845 --> 01:19:05,873
Want to challenge me on agility?
Good!

844
01:19:08,342 --> 01:19:11,706
I'm up for it!
I said I'd accept any challenge.

845
01:19:42,306 --> 01:19:43,506
Animal!

846
01:19:43,805 --> 01:19:46,597
Animal! Disgusting!

847
01:19:46,856 --> 01:19:48,631
What are you doing? Spitting?

848
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:56,419
You see the difference
between a man and an animal?

849
01:19:56,574 --> 01:19:58,449
Tell to whomever you report to:

850
01:19:58,539 --> 01:20:01,270
a man can do anything
and a beast nothing!

851
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:05,271
And that's more…
more than just a difference!

852
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,880
It…it…it's a wide abyss!

853
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,719
Help!

854
01:20:25,936 --> 01:20:28,314
Help! Help!

855
01:20:28,404 --> 01:20:30,661
Help! Let me out!
- Where's the monkey?

856
01:20:30,751 --> 01:20:35,141
I don't know! We were arguing…
- Which way did he go?

857
01:20:35,231 --> 01:20:37,289
… he locked me inside
and ran away!

858
01:20:38,354 --> 01:20:42,507
And me? Let me out!
I don't want to stay here!

859
01:22:15,893 --> 01:22:17,093
Hey!

860
01:22:18,451 --> 01:22:19,651
Say…

861
01:22:20,183 --> 01:22:22,483
you see I'm no ape?

862
01:22:27,329 --> 01:22:30,443
Come on… What are you doing?
Be good, come now!

863
01:22:30,967 --> 01:22:32,767
Look at me very carefully.

864
01:22:33,023 --> 01:22:36,048
Tell me, can't you see?
I'm a man.

865
01:22:37,276 --> 01:22:38,746
Like the rest of you.

866
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,886
I'm a man like your father.
Like your grandfather.

867
01:22:44,599 --> 01:22:45,956
A man.

868
01:22:46,355 --> 01:22:49,296
Cut it out! Stop… stop…

869
01:24:17,384 --> 01:24:20,020
