1
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:32,726
( gunshots )

2
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:07,781
THIS IS WHERE I TOLD
DEPUTY JACKSON TO MEET US.

3
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,249
HEY, LOOK.

4
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,986
THERE'S A STRAY HORSE OVER THERE
WITH A SADDLE ON.

5
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,622
LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

6
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,372
FUZZY, TAKE A LOOK
DOWN THERE.

7
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:46,920
IS THAT HIM?

8
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,789
IT'S JACKSON, ALL RIGHT.

9
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,291
HE MUST HAVE KNOWN
HE WAS MEETING US

10
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:52,560
WITH THE INFORMATION.

11
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,629
THAT MAKES THE THIRD DEPUTY
IN A MONTH.

12
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:59,500
WELL, WE GOTTA
GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

13
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,543
EVERYTHING
COME OFF
ALL RIGHT, JUDD?

14
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,412
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:46,480
YOU KNOW,
THAT DEPUTY--JACKSON.

16
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,281
YOU'RE NOT HERE
TO ASK QUESTIONS.

17
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:49,583
ALL RIGHT.

18
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,521
HEY, JUDD.

19
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:56,490
GRAYSON'S GOT YOUNG WALTERS
IN A GAME OVER THERE.

20
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:13,006
WELL, THAT WASHES ME UP.

21
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:28,388
WOULD YOU MIND
IF I SIT IN?

22
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,991
PLEASED TO HAVE YOU--
HOW ABOUT YOU, WALTERS?

23
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:32,726
SURE.

24
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:34,061
THANK YOU.

25
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:54,748
HEY, BEN,
DRINKS FOR
THE GENTLEMEN.

26
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:56,550
COMIN' RIGHT UP.

27
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:08,796
SHERIFF, DID YOU SEE
MY BROTHER AL?

28
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,698
I WOULDN'T SWEAR TO IT,
MISS WALTERS,

29
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,100
BUT I THINK HE'S OVER
IN THE SALOON.

30
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,504
I BEGGED HIM NOT TO
GO IN THERE.

31
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,551
I'LL HOLD.

32
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,690
WHAT ABOUT YOU, WALTERS?

33
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,696
FORTY BUCKS.

34
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:47,835
IT'LL COST YOU
TWENTY MORE.

35
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,102
THAT BEATS ME.

36
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,340
I'M RIDIN' RIGHT ALONG
WITH YOU.

37
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,341
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

38
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,476
FULL HOUSE.

39
00:07:56,577 --> 00:07:57,511
JUST A MINUTE.

40
00:07:57,611 --> 00:08:00,514
FOUR DEUCES.

41
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,449
YOU COULDN'T HAVE
FOUR DEUCES.

42
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,483
WHY NOT?

43
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,185
I DISCARDED ONE.

44
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,386
ARE YOU SUGGESTING--

45
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,955
YOU STAY OUT OF THIS!

46
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,758
IT'S CROOKED AND MAYBE
YOU'RE A CROOK, TOO.

47
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,860
KEEP TALKING LIKE THAT
AND YOU'LL BE SORRY.

48
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,262
YOU'RE BOTH CROOKS--
I'M GONNA CALL THE LAW ON YOU.

49
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,830
YOU ASKED FOR THIS.

50
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,933
AL!

51
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,110
HE'S DEAD.

52
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,312
YOU MURDERER.

53
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,047
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE,
ASK ANYBODY.

54
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,182
IT WAS COLD-BLOODED MURDER,

55
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,884
JUST LIKE ALL
THE OTHER KILLINGS
AROUND HERE,

56
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,619
AND I'M GOING TO
DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

57
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,353
JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

58
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,823
I'M GOING TO WRITE A LETTER
TO THE UNITED STATES MARSHAL.

59
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:45,292
I'LL TELL HIM WHAT'S HAPPENING
IN THIS TOWN,
AND I'LL NAME NAMES.

60
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:46,827
I WOULDN'T IF I WERE YOU,

61
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,528
AND I'D GET OUT OF TOWN
WHILE YOU'RE STILL HEALTHY.

62
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:52,199
IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN
YOUR THREATS TO MAKE ME
LEAVE TOWN, BILL JUDD.

63
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,968
YEAH? WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

64
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:00,741
I DON'T MIND
A MAN-AGAINST-MAN FIGHT,

65
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:06,780
BUT A MAN-AGAINST-WOMAN FIGHT
CALLS FOR SOME INTERFERENCE.

66
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:14,087
THIS'LL TEACH YA
TO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS!

67
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,710
NOW REACH!

68
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,282
LET'S KEEP THIS
A CLEAN FIGHT.

69
00:10:27,695 --> 00:10:29,863
NOW, MISS, TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

70
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,132
THAT MAN JUST
KILLED MY BROTHER.

71
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,566
WHAT'S THE TROUBLE HERE?

72
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,068
ARREST THAT MAN, SHERIFF.

73
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:35,769
FOR WHAT?

74
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:38,305
FOR MURDER.
HE KILLED AL.

75
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:40,774
THE MAN WAS GOIN' FOR ME,
I SHOT IN SELF-DEFENSE.

76
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,143
IF IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE,
I'M NOT GONNA ARREST HIM.

77
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,578
A MAN'S GOT A RIGHT
TO DEFEND HIMSELF.

78
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,614
WHAT KIND OF A LAWMAN
ARE YOU?

79
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:49,616
HE SHOULD BE ARRESTED
AND HELD FOR TRIAL.

80
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:51,151
I DON'T MAKE ARRESTS
ON THE SAY-SO

81
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,586
OF ANY STRANGER
THAT RIDES INTO TOWN.

82
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:56,623
THEN WE'LL ROUND UP
SOME WITNESSES.

83
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:59,592
WHICH OF YOU SAW HIM
SHOOT DOWN THAT YOUNG MAN?

84
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:05,065
ALL DEAF, DUMB, BLIND.

85
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:09,202
WELL, THE BOYS
GAVE YOU THEIR ANSWER.

86
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,271
NOW GET.

87
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:14,975
I THINK I'LL STICK AROUND--
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE.

88
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:18,712
COME ON, FUZZY,
LET'S HELP THE LADY
WITH HER BROTHER.

89
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,053
I JUST KILLED AL WALTERS.

90
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,554
GOOD, ANOTHER ONE
OUT OF THE WAY.

91
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,022
BUT THERE'S STILL TROUBLE.

92
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,090
WHAT KIND?

93
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,892
HIS SISTER--SAID SHE WAS
WRITING TO THE MARSHAL.

94
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,727
GET HER OUT OF
THIS TERRITORY.

95
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,662
ALL RIGHT, BOSS.
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

96
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:36,997
WHAT IS IT?

97
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:40,567
A STRANGER IN TOWN,
ASKING A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

98
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,102
WHO IS HE?

99
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,738
NOBODY KNOWS--HE WANTED
THE SHERIFF TO ARREST ME.

100
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,439
GET RID OF HIM, TOO.

101
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,574
BUT HOW?

102
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,076
YOU KNOW HOW.

103
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:52,179
YEAH, I KNOW--
AND HE'S GOT IT
COMING TO HIM.

104
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:27,881
HE WAS A WONDERFUL BROTHER.

105
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,917
A LITTLE WILD,
BUT GOOD.

106
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:31,985
HE NEVER HURT ANYBODY.

107
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:36,023
WHY DID THIS HAVE TO
HAPPEN TO US NOW,

108
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:39,392
JUST WHEN EVERYTHING
WAS BEGINNING TO WORK OUT.

109
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,727
WHY, UNCLE BOB?

110
00:12:40,828 --> 00:12:42,262
I DON'T KNOW, BETTY.

111
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:45,032
WE JUST GOTTA MAKE
THE BEST OF THINGS
WITHOUT HIM.

112
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:47,767
COME ON, MISS BETTY.
OUR JOB IS TO SEE

113
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:51,271
THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN
TO ANY MORE FOLKS AROUND HERE.

114
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,637
THIS IS MIGHTY RICH COUNTRY.

115
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,506
HOW COME THERE
AREN'T MORE SETTLERS AROUND?

116
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,341
THERE WERE, LOTS OF THEM,

117
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,844
TILL BILL JUDD AND HIS GANG
SHOWED UP.

118
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:34,447
THIS GAMBLER, GRAYSON--
HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN IN TOWN?

119
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,616
OH, ABOUT TWO MONTHS.

120
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,618
WHAT NOBODY CAN FIGURE OUT

121
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:42,355
IS WHAT A SLICK GAMBLER WANTS
IN A SMALL PLACE LIKE THIS.

122
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,059
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
NOW THAT YOU'RE ALL ALONE?

123
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,461
SHE WON'T BE ALONE--
I'M STAYIN' ON.

124
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:49,863
THANKS, UNCLE BOB.

125
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:51,865
WITH YOU AROUND,
I CAN STICK IT OUT.

126
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:54,134
I LIKE YOUR SPIRIT,
YOUNG LADY.

127
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:56,036
I'LL GO PUT UP
THE HORSES.

128
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:57,604
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GET SUPPER TOGETHER.

129
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,376
I BET YOUR UNCLE'S
A BIG HELP TO YOU.

130
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:04,912
HE'S NOT REALLY MY UNCLE.

131
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,880
HE'S JUST AN OLD FRIEND
OF THE FAMILY'S.

132
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,382
HE WAS WIPED OUT IN THE DROUGHT
ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO

133
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:10,918
AND CAME TO WORK FOR US.

134
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,220
HE'S A LITTLE TOUCHED
ON SOME SUBJECTS,

135
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,022
BUT HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
VERY LOYAL.

136
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:18,725
YOU'LL BE SHORTHANDED
WITHOUT YOUR BROTHER, WON'T YOU?

137
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,293
YES, I WILL.

138
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,230
WOULD IT HELP ANY
IF WE STAYED ON?

139
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,966
THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL--
WOULD YOU?

140
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:29,336
WOULD YOU LIKE TO STAY PUT
FOR A FEW WEEKS, FUZZY?

141
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:32,339
FINE--WE CAN BOTH
USE A LITTLE REST.

142
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:37,410
YEP, IT WAS ME THAT
SETTLED THIS TERRITORY--

143
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,746
FIRST MAN IN THE VALLEY.

144
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,814
TOO BAD YOU LOST
YOUR HOMESTEAD, UNCLE BOB,

145
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,416
WHY DIDN'T YOU
START UP AGAIN?

146
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,986
A LOT OF RIFF-RAFF MOVED IN,
TOOK UP EVERYTHING.

147
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,922
SURE WAS A FINE MEAL,
MISS BETTY.

148
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:52,459
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I DON'T WANT ANY MORE COFFEE.

149
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,593
COME ON,
HAVE ANOTHER CUP.

150
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,395
IT KEEPS ME AWAKE.

151
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,797
YOU DON'T WANT TO
HURT BETTY'S FEELINGS, DO YOU?

152
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,133
( grumbling: ) 
ALL RIGHT.

153
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,244
SOON AS YOU'RE FINISHED,
I'LL SHOW YOU BOYS
WHERE TO BUNK.

154
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:13,981
IT'LL SURE BE FINE
TO STRETCH OUT

155
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,349
IN A NICE,
COMFORTABLE BUNK AGAIN.

156
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:23,456
AH, IF IT AIN'T ONE THING,
IT'S ANOTHER.

157
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:25,658
I'M GONNA GET ME
A NEW PARTNER, THAT'S ALL.

158
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,227
OKAY, SO LONG.

159
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,929
YOU TRYIN' TO
GET RID OF ME?

160
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,999
WELL, YOU'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT
THE LIFE YOU LEAD.

161
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,367
I DON'T SEE WHY WE
STAY OUT HERE ALL NIGHT

162
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,104
WHEN WE COULD HAVE SLEPT IN
A NICE, COMFORTABLE BUNK.

163
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,472
'CAUSE I GOT A HUNCH
SOMETHING'S GONNA HAPPEN.

164
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,709
YOU MEAN WE'RE GONNA
SIT HERE ALL DAY?

165
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,311
IF IT'S NECESSARY.

166
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:47,347
I CAN'T DO IT,
I'LL FALL ASLEEP.

167
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,849
NOT AFTER ALL THE COFFEE
YOU DRANK LAST NIGHT.

168
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,020
NO, THAT WORE OFF
HOURS AGO.

169
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,146
THERE'S THE RANCH.

170
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:21,381
WE'LL LEAVE OUR HORSES HERE
AND SNEAK UP ON FOOT.

171
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,350
JOE, YOU AND CROWDER
BRING THE STUFF WITH YOU.

172
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,182
WE GOT ENOUGH TO
BRING DOWN TEN RANCHES.

173
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,084
NOW, REMEMBER INSTRUCTIONS.

174
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,918
EACH OF YOU TAKE
ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE.

175
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,453
I'LL COVER THE FRONT DOOR

176
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,755
SO I CAN PLUG THAT STRANGER
WHEN HE RUNS OUT.

177
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,535
WHY, THEM DIRTY RATS.

178
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,271
COME ON, WE'LL GIVE 'EM
A RECEPTION.

179
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,868
YOU READY?

180
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:23,603
LET 'EM COME.

181
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,258
( gunshot )

182
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,169
I WONDER WHAT'S HAPPENED?

183
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:35,842
HELLO, TOUGH GUY.

184
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:37,610
FIND BUNCH OF CUTTHROATS,

185
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,212
TRYING TO BURN DOWN
A GIRL'S RANCH.

186
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:41,648
YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS,
MY MEN WILL--

187
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,783
YOUR MEN ARE ALL ASLEEP,
JUDD, TAKE A LOOK.

188
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:55,322
WE JUST HEARD A SHOT--
WHAT'S THE TROUBLE?

189
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,923
THIS HOMBRE 
AND HIS THREE PALS

190
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:59,091
WERE GOING TO BURN DOWN
YOUR RANCH, MISS BETTY.

191
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,328
NO!

192
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,330
THERE'S THE PROOF--
KEROSENE AND RAGS.

193
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,632
WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
BURNED ALIVE,

194
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:07,500
IF IT HADN'T BEEN
FOR YOUR FORESIGHT.

195
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,436
WE DON'T KNOW
HOW TO THANK YOU, SON.

196
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:10,637
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

197
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:13,072
WHY ARE THEY SO ANXIOUS
TO GET RID OF US?

198
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:14,541
I'LL HAVE THE ANSWER TO THAT

199
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:16,476
WHEN I FIND OUT WHO'S
GIVING THEM THEIR ORDERS.

200
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:18,244
JUDD'S NOT SMART ENOUGH
TO BE THE BIG BOSS.

201
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:20,980
WE'LL HOLD THEM HERE
UNTIL AFTER DARK,

202
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,282
AND THEN WE'LL
TAKE THEM INTO TOWN.

203
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:25,618
THAT WAY, IT WON'T ATTRACT
SO MUCH ATTENTION.

204
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,704
( knocking )

205
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,287
KINDA LATE, SHERIFF,
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'LL MIND.

206
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:03,356
GOT A LITTLE BUSINESS FOR YOU.

207
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,024
WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS?

208
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,760
THESE TWO JUMPED US
AS WE WERE RIDING
PAST THE WALTER'S PLACE.

209
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,630
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE
WITH KEROSENE AND RAGS?

210
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,865
LOCK 'EM UP, SHERIFF,
UNTIL WE CAN ARRANGE A TRIAL.

211
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:15,802
BY WHAT AUTHORITY ARE YOU
TELLING ME WHAT TO DO?

212
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:18,304
THIS GUN--YOU WANT TO
ARGUE WITH ME?

213
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:19,972
WELL, SINCE YOU
PUT IT THAT WAY.

214
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,841
OPEN UP THAT CELL.

215
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:39,125
NOW, I EXPECT THESE MEN
TO BE HERE IN THE MORNING.

216
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:40,527
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

217
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:41,828
JUST WHAT I SAID.

218
00:22:41,928 --> 00:22:44,263
ARE YOU INSINUATING
I MIGHT BETRAY MY OFFICE?

219
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,098
THAT'S WHAT I'M INSINUATING.

220
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,436
YOU KNOW, THAT STAR
YOU WEAR ON YOUR VEST
IS REMOVABLE.

221
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,303
WHO'S GOING TO
REMOVE IT?

222
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,339
MAYBE THE PEOPLE
OF THIS COUNTY

223
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,007
WILL HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY ABOUT THAT.

224
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,443
GOOD NIGHT, SHERIFF.

225
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:57,877
PLEASANT DREAMS.

226
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:05,885
THAT WAS A GOOD NIGHT'S WORK--
NOW WE CAN GET SOME SLEEP.

227
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:07,219
NOT SO FAST, FUZZ.

228
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,488
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

229
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:09,989
WE'VE STILL GOT WORK TO DO.

230
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,223
OH, CHEY, I--

231
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,659
COME ON.

232
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:46,926
WELL, THIS GIVES US
A GOOD VIEW.

233
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,360
GOOD VIEW OF WHAT?

234
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:52,398
THE STREET--
THE JAIL, IN PARTICULAR.

235
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:54,701
WE'LL JUST WAIT HERE
A WHILE.

236
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,636
WHAT FOR?

237
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:58,971
BECAUSE I DON'T TRUST
THAT SHERIFF,

238
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:01,974
AND I WANT TO BE AROUND
IF MY HUNCH IS RIGHT.

239
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,677
IF I'D A KNOWED THIS WAS
GONNA BE AN ALL-NIGHT PICNIC,

240
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,779
I'D A BROUGHT
MY BLANKET ROLL.

241
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:10,116
RELAX. WE MIGHT HAVE
A LONG WAIT.

242
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:12,251
WAIT?

243
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:13,920
NOTHIN' MORE CAN HAPPEN NOW--

244
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,155
AH-CHOO!

245
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,827
NOTHIN' MORE,
EXCEPT ME CATCHIN' A COLD.

246
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:22,995
SORRY, FUZZY,

247
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:25,698
BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS
WE'VE GOT TO DO,

248
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:27,834
AND WATCHING THE JAIL
IS ONE OF THEM.

249
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:49,589
( mumbling )

250
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:53,059
WAKE UP, FUZZY,
IT'S DAYLIGHT.

251
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:01,300
OH--MY ACHING BACK.

252
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,736
ARE YOU SATISFIED?

253
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,272
NO, I'M NOT.
WE'LL WAIT A LITTLE LONGER.

254
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:09,508
DOGGONE IT, CHEY, WE COULDA HAD
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

255
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:12,011
HOLD IT--
TAKE A LOOK.

256
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:25,592
WHY, THAT DIRTY,
DOUBLE-DEALIN' SHERIFF,

257
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,426
LETTIN' THEM CROOKS
GET AWAY!

258
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,161
COME ON, CHEY,
LET'S GET 'EM!

259
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,196
WAIT.

260
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:31,631
THEY'LL GET AWAY!

261
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:33,800
THAT'S WHAT
I WANT 'EM TO DO.

262
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:44,310
COME ON,
WE'LL FOLLOW 'EM.

263
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:31,550
( knocks in code )

264
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,585
Boss:
GET IN HERE--

265
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:35,722
I GOT A FEW THINGS
TO SAY TO YOU FOOLS.

266
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:43,195
THIS IS WHAT
I FIGURED WE'D FIND.

267
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:47,199
LET'S LEAVE THE HORSES HERE
AND GET CLOSER.

268
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,185
BUT HOW WOULD WE KNOW
THEY'D BE LAYIN' FOR US?

269
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:08,454
I PAY YOU TO THINK
AS WELL AS SHOOT.

270
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:10,857
YOU KNEW THAT STRANGER
WAS AROUND,

271
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:12,558
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN
PREPARED FOR HIM.

272
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:15,661
WE GOT EVERYBODY OUT
BUT THE WALTERS GIRL
AND A COUPLE OF OTHERS,

273
00:28:15,762 --> 00:28:19,631
AND I AIN'T GONNA
BE STOPPED NOW.

274
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:21,700
Let's jump 'em before
they can pull their guns.

275
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:24,203
Let's wait and see
if they mention Grayson.

276
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:25,637
WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?

277
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:27,273
GET THAT MAN IN BLACK.

278
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:32,111
WHAT'S THE MATTER? SCARED?

279
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,313
I AIN'T SCARED, BUT HE'S
A SLIPPERY CUSTOMER.

280
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:37,516
NOW, DON'T GET ME WRONG--
I'M NOT BACKING OUT.

281
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:39,986
YOU BETTER NOT BACK OUT.

282
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:41,720
AH-AH--

283
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,422
( muffled sneeze )

284
00:28:45,825 --> 00:28:47,693
You want to have
the whole bunch
out on us?

285
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:50,963
I can't help it--
got cold, stayin' up all night.

286
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,165
MY ORDERS TO YOU ARE TO
GET THE MAN IN BLACK,

287
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:55,034
HIS PARTNER,
AND THE WALTERS GIRL.

288
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:57,603
I WANT IT DONE
IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

289
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:59,371
RIGHT.

290
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:02,809
AH-CHOO!!

291
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,451
I THINK I KNOW
WHO THAT IS.

292
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,186
ALL RIGHT, BOYS.

293
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:38,905
SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND
OVER THERE.

294
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,576
COME ON, BOYS.

295
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:07,499
( gunshot )

296
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,261
LET'S GET TO THE HORSES!

297
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,782
WE'LL HEAD AROUND
SUNSET ROCK.

298
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,719
WELL, LET'S DO SOMETHING-- 
IT'S GETTING WARM AROUND HERE.

299
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:08,554
WHEW! THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.

300
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,723
YEAH, NOW WE CAN GO LOOK
THAT SHACK OVER WITHOUT
BEING DISTURBED.

301
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,925
MAYBE WE CAN
GRAB THE LEADER.

302
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:15,794
NO, HE'S TOO SMART
TO HANG AROUND THERE,

303
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:17,563
BUT I'M HOPING
HE LEFT SOME CLUES.

304
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:20,732
HEY, UH,
THERE'S UNCLE BOB.

305
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,637
SO IT IS.

306
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,509
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU FELLAS.

307
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,044
I JUST BEEN TO TOWN,

308
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:33,779
AND THEY TELL ME
JUDD AND HIS GANG
BROKE OUT OF JAIL.

309
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:36,982
WE KNOW--WE'RE ON OUR WAY
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR HIDEOUT.

310
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:40,086
THE FELLA THAT GIVES 'EM ORDERS
WAS THERE A COUPLE MINUTES AGO.

311
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:41,487
I'M GOIN' WITH YOU.

312
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:44,756
NO, GET BACK TO BETTY--
I DON'T WANT HER TO BE ALONE.

313
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,058
RIGHT.

314
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:20,126
I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANYBODY HOME.

315
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:22,394
I'M NOT TAKING
ANY CHANCES.

316
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:35,274
LOOKS LIKE THE BIRD
FLEW THE COOP.

317
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:38,344
I DON'T THINK WE'LL
FIND ANYTHING HERE.

318
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,789
I'M NOT SO SURE--
DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE?

319
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:55,461
THAT'S NOTHIN' BUT
A BUNCH OF OLD SPUR MARKS.

320
00:34:57,796 --> 00:35:00,199
WHEN WE FIND THE MAN
WHOSE SPURS FIT THESE MARKS,

321
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:03,302
WE'VE GOT
THE LEADER OF THE GANG.

322
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:07,206
MAYBE YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING.

323
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:17,115
FIND ANYTHING
IN THAT SHACK?

324
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:18,584
NOT A THING.

325
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:20,386
THEN WE STILL DON'T KNOW
WHO'S GIVING JUDD HIS ORDERS.

326
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:23,855
I'VE BEEN THINKING,
AND I'VE GOT A SUSPICION.

327
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,557
WHAT IS IT?

328
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:28,093
GRAYSON--WHAT'S
THE ATTRACTION
IN BUFFALO GAP

329
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:30,095
FOR A BIG-TIME GAMBLER
LIKE HIM?

330
00:35:30,196 --> 00:35:31,930
HE'S HERE
FOR SOME REASON.

331
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,732
MAYBE YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING.

332
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:37,203
I HEARD HE GOT TO TOWN
JUST ABOUT THE TIME
THIS DIRTY BUSINESS STARTED.

333
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:38,904
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
UNCLE BOB?

334
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:41,740
WELL, IT COULD BE.

335
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,942
FUZZY, I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

336
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,844
IF IT'S GONNA
GET ME IN TROUBLE,

337
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,112
I DON'T WANT
NOTHIN' TO DO WITH IT.

338
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:49,515
YOU'RE GONNA DO
A LITTLE GAMBLING.

339
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:53,352
NO SIR--NOT ME.

340
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,833
COME ON,
QUIT STALLING.

341
00:36:09,235 --> 00:36:11,803
DON'T RUSH ME--
I GOTTA THINK.

342
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,044
IF YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR YOUR PARTNER,
HE'S NOT COMING.

343
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:20,579
WHY NOT?

344
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,582
HE MET WITH A LITTLE ACCIDENT
JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN.

345
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,883
LET'S PLAY CARDS.

346
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:30,155
I-I GOTTA HAVE
A DRINK FIRST.

347
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:31,757
HEY, BEN.

348
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:36,528
GIVE THIS OLD GEEZER
A DRINK.

349
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:38,997
OLD GEEZER?
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW--

350
00:36:39,097 --> 00:36:40,732
WHAT DO YOU
WANNA DRINK?

351
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,234
GIVE ME A DRINK OF WATER.

352
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:44,503
WATER?! WE AIN'T GOT ANY.

353
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:49,241
IF YOU'RE CALLIN' ME,
PUT IN YOUR CHIPS.

354
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:02,554
LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU GOT.

355
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:05,156
FULL HOUSE.

356
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:07,092
HA! NOW I'M GONNA
LOOK FOR MY PARTNER.

357
00:37:07,192 --> 00:37:08,059
NOT SO FAST.

358
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,562
I'M TOPPING YOU.

359
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:13,565
HEY!

360
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:17,035
THAT'S THE SIXTH TIME
THIS HAS HAPPENED--
YOU'RE CHEATING!

361
00:37:17,135 --> 00:37:18,304
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

362
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:20,272
I SAID, YOU MUST BE CHEATING.

363
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:22,274
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU ACCUSE PEOPLE.

364
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:23,809
WELL, I STILL MEAN IT.

365
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:28,314
PROVE IT OR FACE
THE CONSEQUENCES--
HE'S MY PAL.

366
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:30,382
MAYBE I CAN PROVE THEM, JUDD.

367
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:35,787
HEY, CHEY, YOU ALL RIGHT?

368
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:38,457
YEP. YOUR MEN NEED
SHOOTING LESSONS, CROWDER.

369
00:37:38,557 --> 00:37:42,027
PUT UP YOUR HANDS, EVERYBODY.

370
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:43,795
JUDD, DROP YOUR GUN.

371
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:56,808
FIRST POKER DECK I EVER SAW
WITH ALL TOP CARDS.

372
00:37:56,908 --> 00:38:00,178
YOU'RE PRETTY HANDY'
WITH THOSE CARDS, GRAYSON.

373
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,247
WHAT OF IT?

374
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:04,215
WHAT'S YOUR CUT
ON THIS RACKET?

375
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:07,619
ALL RIGHT,
YOU'LL TALK LATER.

376
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:11,289
I'M ARRESTING YOU
ONCE AGAIN, JUDD,

377
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,360
FOR TRYING TO BURN DOWN
THE WALTERS' RANCH.

378
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,795
YOU TOO, GRAYSON, FOR--

379
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:35,213
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO WITH ME?

380
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,182
YOU'LL FIND OUT--
GET ON YOUR FEET.

381
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:38,750
WHAT HAPPENED TO JUDD?

382
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:41,753
HE GOT OUT THE BACK DOOR--
SHOULD I GO AFTER HIM?

383
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:43,822
NEVER MIND,
WE'LL GET HIM LATER.

384
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:45,090
COME ON, GRAYSON.

385
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:58,169
( gunshot )

386
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,838
TAKE COVER, FUZZY!

387
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:01,607
WHERE'D IT COME FROM?

388
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:04,576
NEVER MIND THAT,
I WANT GRAYSON TO TALK
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

389
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:17,823
GRAYSON--
GET HIM INTO THE HOUSE.

390
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:36,307
I'LL GO FOR A DOCTOR.

391
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:38,744
IT'S TOO LATE--
I'M FINISHED.

392
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:40,011
WHO SHOT YOU?

393
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:41,246
MUST HAVE BEEN JUDD.

394
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,414
WHY?

395
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:45,451
THEY WERE AFRAID
I'D TALK.

396
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:48,119
I GUESS THE BOSS
DIDN'T TRUST ME.

397
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:53,158
I TOLD HIM YESTERDAY
I WAS FED UP WITH
ALL THESE KILLINGS...

398
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:55,561
I DIDN'T MIND THE GAMBLING.

399
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:57,362
WHY DID THEY BRING YOU
TO BUFFALO GAP?

400
00:39:57,463 --> 00:40:00,098
TO HELP CLEAR OUT
THE SETTLERS,

401
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:02,801
PUT 'EM IN DEBT
SO THEY'D LEAVE.

402
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,503
WHAT WAS YOUR CUT?

403
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:06,905
HE PROMISED ME
A SECTION OF LAND,

404
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:11,777
SAID HE WAS GONNA BE KING--
KING OF THE WEST.

405
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:13,111
WHO IS HE?

406
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:14,446
I THINK HE'S CRAZY.

407
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:15,881
WHO IS HE?

408
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:17,616
HIS NAME IS--

409
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:28,193
HE'S FINISHED.

410
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:30,496
CHEY, I'M WORRIED
ABOUT UNCLE BOB.

411
00:40:30,596 --> 00:40:32,498
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

412
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:34,265
YESTERDAY, AFTER YOU LEFT.

413
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,768
SAID HE WAS GOING DOWN
TO THE SOUTH LINE
TO FIX A RAIL,

414
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,670
I HAVEN'T SEEN
OR HEARD FROM HIS SINCE.

415
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,506
HAS JUDD OR HIS MEN
BEEN AROUND?

416
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:42,273
NO, DO YOU EXPECT
THEY WILL BE?

417
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,676
YOU NEVER CAN TELL
WHEN A RATTLESNAKE'S
GONNA STRIKE.

418
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:47,546
I'M AWFULLY WORRIED
ABOUT UNCLE BOB.

419
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:49,948
DON'T WORRY, BETTY,
WE'LL FIND HIM.

420
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:52,984
( horse approaching )

421
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,424
UNCLE BOB,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

422
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:00,959
YES, BUT ONLY
BY GOOD LUCK.

423
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:05,897
THE GANG JUMPED ME
AND TOOK ME TO THE SHACK.

424
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:09,400
THEY WENT LOOKIN' FOR YOU--
THAT'S WHEN I MADE MY GETAWAY.

425
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:11,202
GRAYSON HAS JUST BEEN KILLED
BY THE GANG.

426
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,505
GRAYSON! WHEN?

427
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:15,373
RIGHT HERE,
A FEW MINUTES AGO.

428
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,908
DID YOU GET ANYTHING
OUT OF HIM?

429
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:19,477
NOT MUCH--HE DIED BEFORE
HE COULD NAME THE LEADER.

430
00:41:19,578 --> 00:41:20,979
WHAT ARE WE DOING TO DO?

431
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,782
IF WE HEAD FOR THE SHACK,
I THINK WE CAN TRAP THE BOSS--

432
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:25,450
HE SAID HE WAS COMING BACK.

433
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:26,652
DID YOU SEE HIM?

434
00:41:26,752 --> 00:41:28,486
NO, HE KEPT OUT OF SIGHT.

435
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:30,355
IT'S TIME FOR A SHOWDOWN.

436
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:33,659
WE'VE GOT TO CAPTURE
THIS MADMAN BEFORE HE
DOES ANY MORE DAMAGE.

437
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:36,094
WE'LL TAKE GRAYSON'S BODY
TO TOWN AND HEAD FOR THE SHACK.

438
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:37,529
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

439
00:41:37,629 --> 00:41:39,631
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS, BETTY.

440
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:42,701
THEY KILLED MY BROTHER--
THIS IS MY FIGHT, TOO.

441
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,318
LOOKS LIKE
THE PLACE
IS DESERTED.

442
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:02,020
WE'LL GO IN
AND HAVE
A LOOK AROUND.

443
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,655
I BETTER STAY OUTSIDE
TO KEEP GUARD.

444
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:06,124
FUZZY WILL GUARD OUTSIDE--
YOU COME WITH US.

445
00:42:13,832 --> 00:42:16,568
THE BOSS WAS RIGHT--
HE SAID HE'D GET THEM
TO THE SHACK.

446
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:20,606
NOTHIN' WE CAN DO
TILL THE BOSS SHOWS UP.

447
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:24,776
MAYBE THERE IS--
COME OVER HERE.

448
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:29,280
SEE THOSE?

449
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,349
SPUR MARKS.

450
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:34,485
I NOTICED A VERY FUNNY THING.

451
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:37,789
SPUR MARKS CAN BE
LIKE FINGERPRINTS

452
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,891
WHEN IT COMES TO
TRAPPING A KILLER.

453
00:42:39,991 --> 00:42:45,797
I'M WEARING ONE TYPE OF SPUR,
BETTY'S WEARING ANOTHER,

454
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,866
AND YOU'RE WEARING
STILL ANOTHER.

455
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:50,568
I THINK YOU'RE WEARING THE ONES
THAT FIT THOSE MARKS!

456
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:51,903
CHEYENNE!

457
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:53,672
YOU'RE CRAZY!

458
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:55,573
THERE'S ONE WAY
WE CAN BE SURE.

459
00:42:55,674 --> 00:42:58,143
SUPPOSE YOU SIT DOWN
AND PUT YOUR FEET UP,

460
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:00,078
SO WE CAN COMPARE THE MARKS.

461
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:01,479
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

462
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,081
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

463
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:04,616
AFRAID THEY'LL MATCH?

464
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:08,119
NO...I AIN'T AFRAID.

465
00:43:16,728 --> 00:43:18,630
( hears commotion )

466
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:23,468
YOU'RE A SMART MAN--
IT'S ME.

467
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:26,371
UNCLE BOB,
HOW COULD YOU?

468
00:43:26,471 --> 00:43:28,740
YOU HEAR THAT?

469
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,576
I HAD NOTHIN'--
ME, THE FIRST MAN OUT HERE,

470
00:43:31,677 --> 00:43:33,745
ME, WHO SETTLED THIS TERRITORY.

471
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:37,348
IT BELONGS TO ME,
NOT ALL THE LANDJUMPERS
THAT MOVED IN.

472
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,050
IT'S MY LAND,

473
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:43,254
AND YOU NOR NOBODY ELSE IS GONNA
KEEP ME FROM GETTIN' IT--

474
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:44,723
( gunshot )

475
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:50,729
I KINDA FIGURED IT WAS YOU
ALL THE TIME.

476
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:56,968
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
THE BOSS MUST BE HAVING TROUBLE.

477
00:43:57,068 --> 00:43:59,771
LET'S GO,
WE'LL SURROUND
THE PLACE.

478
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:09,748
I'M SURE GLAD YOU WERE
ON YOUR TOES, FUZZY.

479
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,322
I'M TAKING YOU IN.

480
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,726
WE GOT COMPANY!

481
00:44:20,826 --> 00:44:21,960
COVER THIS MADMAN,
BETTY--

482
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,594
THEY'RE SURROUNDING
THE SHACK.

483
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:25,430
YOU AIN'T
GETTIN' AWAY ALIVE.

484
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,165
NEITHER ARE YOU.

485
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:28,599
FUZZY, TAKE A WINDOW.

486
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,869
KEEP LOW AND DON'T LET HIM
TRY ANY TRICKS.

487
00:45:30,161 --> 00:45:30,962
AH HA!

488
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:33,965
THAT PUTS ONE OF 'EM
OUT OF THE WAY.

489
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:45,343
YOU GOT AN IDEA?

490
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:47,245
YEAH.

491
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:49,948
WE'LL STOP FIRING,
AND THEY'LL GET CURIOUS

492
00:45:50,048 --> 00:45:52,183
AND COME IN TO SEE
WHAT HAPPENED.

493
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:55,453
WE CAN TRY IT.

494
00:46:10,035 --> 00:46:12,403
BETTY, STRETCH OUT
ON THE FLOOR AND DON'T MOVE.

495
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:14,739
FUZZY, GET BEHIND THAT DOOR
AND KEEP YOUR GUN READY.

496
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,641
YOU--GET IN THAT CHAIR
OVER THERE.

497
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:19,110
GO ON, MOVE.

498
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:26,351
NOW REMEMBER, YOU'RE COVERED--
ONE WRONG MOVE AND YOU GET IT.

499
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:30,021
HERE'S THE DEAL--WE PLAY POSSUM
TILL THEY GET INSIDE.

500
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,523
THEN FUZZY, YOU TAKE 'EM
FROM THE BACK.

501
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,658
IT WON'T WORK.

502
00:46:33,758 --> 00:46:36,895
IF IT DON'T, YOU'LL BE
THE FIRST TO GO.

503
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:16,301
THEY'VE BEEN QUITE
FOR NEARLY FIVE MINUTES.

504
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:18,469
THEY'RE EITHER DEAD
OR PLAYIN' TRICKS--

505
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,271
WE'LL FIND OUT WHICH.

506
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,200
IT'S THE WALTERS GIRL,
SHE'S DEAD.

507
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,309
( knocking in code )

508
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,579
HEY, BOSS,
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

509
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:38,049
Say yes, have 'em come in.

510
00:48:40,718 --> 00:48:43,121
ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
COME ON IN.

511
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:49,961
DROP THOSE GUNS AND REACH!

512
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:36,267

I GUESS PETER NEVER THOUGHT
HE'D BE A PRISONER
IN HIS OWN JAIL.

516
00:52:28,279 --> 00:52:29,747
THAT'S JUST WHERE HE BELONGS.

00:52:39,424 --> 00:52:41,659
WE'RE GOIN' UP TO SUNSET ROCK
TO WATCH THE MOON COME UP.

521
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:43,561
BY THE WAY,
HERE'S A PRESENT FOR YOU.

522
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,296
WHAT'S THIS FOR?

523
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:50,368
TO KEEP YOU AWAKE, SO YOU WON'T
GO TO SLEEP ON THE JOB.

524
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:00,545

525
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,420
