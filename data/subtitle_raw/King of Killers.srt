1
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,106
<i>Daddy,</i>
<i>I'm scared. I miss Mommy.</i>

2
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:48,743
<i>Marcus?</i>

3
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:02,824
Uh-huh.

4
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:04,491
Just remember for next time.

5
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,728
I don't like meeting clients
this late at night.

6
00:02:06,761 --> 00:02:09,463
<i>I know. I know. Trust me.</i>

7
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,667
<i>But, look, you know</i>
<i>how the company is.</i>
<i>They need to close.</i>

8
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,168
<i>And you're the best closer</i>
<i>the company has.</i>

9
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,237
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>
<i>Do you want me to beg?</i>

10
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,172
No, you don't have to beg.

11
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:21,042
But dinner...
that'd be nice.

12
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:24,311
<i>You got it. Call me</i>
<i>with some good news</i>
<i>when you're done.</i>

13
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,370
Hey, what can I get you?

14
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,478
How about a Shirley Temple?

15
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:00,247
Are you sure?

16
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,684
I like to live dangerously.

17
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,318
Okay.

18
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:24,005
Back to the other bar.

19
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,885
- Hold on. Get lost.
- Hey.

20
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:46,627
Please. Please.

21
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,296
I can pay--

22
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,607
<i>Yeah?</i>

23
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,010
How'd it go?

24
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:11,546
- <i>Like they all do.</i>
- Good.

25
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,149
<i>'Cause I got another client.</i>
<i>Rush job tomorrow.</i>

26
00:05:15,183 --> 00:05:16,551
Tomorrow?

27
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:19,086
Brother, my anniversary
is tomorrow.

28
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,689
I got
a PTA meeting at 6:00.

29
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:24,559
<i>What? We have</i>
<i>a nine-to-five now?</i>

30
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:27,795
Come on. The world
doesn't stop for us.

31
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,903
All right. What time?

32
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:39,073
I'll call you with the details.
You're an ace, buddy.

33
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,242
<i>Live long and prosper.</i>

34
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:43,878
Yeah, yeah, the force
be with you too.

35
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,698
Let go.

36
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:06,133
- What, what, what? I'm not.
- Stop that. Don't.

37
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,501
Didn't do anything.

38
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:08,603
- Don't.
- What?

39
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:09,804
- You're doing it.
- I'm not.

40
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,138
- You are!
- I'm not doing-- What, what?

41
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:12,372
- You're doing it.
- I'm, I'm-- What?

42
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:22,817
- Aah!
- Whoop.

43
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:33,761
- Mommy?
- Hmm?

44
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,428
Can I have
some more pancakes?

45
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,365
Hmm. Yeah, okay.

46
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,166
But how about just one,
because last time

47
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,501
your eyes were too big
for your tummy

48
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,402
and you got a bellyache.
Do you remember?

49
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,404
Okay, but they're
so delicious.

50
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,407
Well, I thank you for that.
They are pretty good,
aren't they?

51
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,510
Smells so good.

52
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:52,246
- Oh, hey you.
- Mmm. Hey, yourself.

53
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,282
Daddy!

54
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:04,392
Mm-hmm.

55
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:09,530
Aha!

56
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,534
Aha!

57
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,670
- La la la la la!
- La la la la la!

58
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,339
Hey, how was work
last night?

59
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,808
- Eventful.
- Another sale?

60
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:21,876
Come on.

61
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,245
- Who are you talking to?
- Okay.

62
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,478
Well, that's what
I like to hear.

63
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:26,614
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

64
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,115
- Mm-mm-mm.
- So...

65
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:30,450
What are we gonna do tonight?

66
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,219
- Tonight?
- Hmm.

67
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:33,587
What do you
wanna do tonight?

68
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:36,824
- I--
- Well, there's a game on.

69
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:40,493
- You forgot, didn't you?
- Forgot?

70
00:07:42,363 --> 00:07:43,898
- About?
- Ugh.

71
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,934
- You suck!
- Oh. Come on.

72
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:49,704
How could I forget about the day
I married my unicorn?

73
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:51,305
- You better keep it that way.
- Mm-hmm.

74
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:54,108
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm working on it. Mm-hmm.

75
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,811
- Okay. I gotta go. Love you.
- Bye.

76
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:58,179
- Love you.
- I'll see you later.

77
00:07:58,212 --> 00:07:59,547
- Daddy's got to work.
- Bye.

78
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,982
- Bye.
- Well,

79
00:08:01,015 --> 00:08:03,651
- guess it's just you
and me, hey, kiddo.
- Yeah.

80
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:15,863
Yeah?

81
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,531
<i>We're still on</i>
<i>for tonight, right?</i>

82
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:19,333
<i>Eight p.m. at the Coal Train.</i>

83
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:20,968
<i>The rest is</i>
<i>coming over by text.</i>

84
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:23,704
Right, tonight,
8:00 p.m. I got it.

85
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,132
Mm...

86
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:01,368
Marcus?

87
00:10:03,538 --> 00:10:05,339
Oh.
I'm so sorry.

88
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:23,958
What do we have?

89
00:10:24,593 --> 00:10:25,759
This.

90
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:30,164
What the hell does that do?

91
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:33,134
The real question is
what can't it do?

92
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:37,805
This is what they call
a "crystal matrix unit."

93
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:40,074
It will replace hard
drives of any type.

94
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:45,079
Each one of these
can contain data
of a million supercomputers.

95
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:48,115
Marcus?

96
00:10:51,252 --> 00:10:56,724
If anything has a basis
for artificial intelligence,
this is it.

97
00:11:03,565 --> 00:11:05,266
Who are we selling it to?

98
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:13,608
The Chinese,
then Arabs, Nigerians,
and of course, the Russians.

99
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:18,312
Get up.

100
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:23,484
Can I help you?

101
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:24,785
H-hey, brother.

102
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:32,793
Dimaz, what is going on?

103
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:37,599
No, no, no, no, no, no!

104
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:02,056
No, no!

105
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:02,783
Marcus?

106
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,190
Baby!

107
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:12,560
Wait! No, no, no. No!

108
00:13:12,594 --> 00:13:14,629
Wait-- Kar--

109
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:17,965
No!

110
00:13:19,768 --> 00:13:22,570
Baby! Baby,
baby, baby...

111
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,406
Baby...

112
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:39,179
<i>Morning, Marc.</i>
<i>How'd you sleep?</i>

113
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,216
Good, good.

114
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,985
Coffee?

115
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,987
Thanks, but I really
don't have time.

116
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,390
I mean, I'm already
late for work.

117
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,626
Marc, sit down.

118
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,743
Ms. Aitkens, look, um,

119
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:13,914
I am extremely grateful
that you moved in after Karla.

120
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,551
How could I not wanna take care
of my own grandbaby?

121
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,521
Still, I mean--

122
00:15:19,554 --> 00:15:21,155
This isn't about me, Marc.

123
00:15:21,823 --> 00:15:23,457
This is about you.

124
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:27,127
You've got to start
living your life again.

125
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,397
I notice it and Kimberley
notices it too.

126
00:15:30,431 --> 00:15:32,032
You're not happy.

127
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,201
And when you're not happy,
that affects Kimberley,

128
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,203
because she feels helpless.

129
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:40,809
She's already lost her mother.

130
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,678
She doesn't need to lose
her father as well.

131
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:22,684
Don't worry, baby.

132
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:26,721
I'll find out who did this.

133
00:16:58,252 --> 00:17:01,823
<i>Hello, Mr. Garan.</i>
<i>My name is Roman Korza,</i>

134
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:03,858
<i>and you are cordially invited</i>

135
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:06,528
<i>to enter into</i>
<i>an exclusive contract</i>

136
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:09,731
<i>to eliminate the world's</i>
<i>greatest assassin.</i>

137
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:14,067
<i>You will be wired</i>
<i>ten million dollars</i>

138
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:16,136
<i>upon services rendered.</i>

139
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:19,874
<i>RSVP by texting the letter Y</i>

140
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:23,545
<i>to 323-309.</i>

141
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:26,246
<i>Upon receiving confirmation,</i>

142
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,384
<i>you will be wired expenses</i>
<i>to travel to Tokyo.</i>

143
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,152
<i>Arigato.</i>

144
00:17:34,556 --> 00:17:40,160
<i>Happy birthday, dear Kimberley.</i>

145
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:44,699
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

146
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,234
Make a wish.

147
00:17:52,707 --> 00:17:55,710
- Oh!
Good girl!
- There you go.

148
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:57,110
What'd you wish for?

149
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:01,248
I wished for Daddy
to be happy.

150
00:18:03,818 --> 00:18:06,721
Kiddo. Daddy is happy.

151
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:09,657
And as long as
I have you, I'm happy.

152
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:10,725
Come here.

153
00:18:15,797 --> 00:18:17,197
Okay, let's open
some presents.

154
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,132
Okay? Let's do it.

155
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:22,436
<i>Wonder what it is.</i>

156
00:19:03,745 --> 00:19:06,179
Mr. Garan, well, I can
assure you don't need that.

157
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,782
I'm only here to talk.
May I?

158
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:10,350
Thank you.

159
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:14,889
How'd you find me?

160
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:16,691
We have our resources.

161
00:19:19,594 --> 00:19:22,262
I wanna know why you haven't
accepted my invitation.

162
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,499
It's the opportunity
of a lifetime.

163
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:28,803
Thanks, but no thanks.

164
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:32,640
As you can see,
I have more important
things to do.

165
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:36,144
We know who you are, Marcus.

166
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:39,479
A former company man
with all the related benefits.

167
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:42,150
And actually once
top of your game.

168
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:47,387
Of course, within your limited
sphere of influence.

169
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:57,799
We also know a tragic incident
took your wife

170
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:00,768
and shattered your life.

171
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:05,173
And for that, I offer
my deepest condolences.

172
00:20:06,007 --> 00:20:08,776
And now I know you're focused
on tracking her killer.

173
00:20:10,678 --> 00:20:12,714
Word in our community
travels fast.

174
00:20:13,781 --> 00:20:15,883
Now, I've offered you
a chance of a lifetime.

175
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,251
Look after your family.

176
00:20:20,788 --> 00:20:23,256
You heard of Jorg Drakos?

177
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,861
Who hasn't?

178
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,665
Former Greek EYP lifer

179
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,801
said to have killed more people
than the plague.

180
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:37,605
Some say he's a myth.

181
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,744
- What about him?
- The King of Killers,

182
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:46,681
my employer,
he wants him eliminated.

183
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,583
Who's your employer?

184
00:20:48,616 --> 00:20:50,450
Oh, come on,
you know the drill.

185
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:53,020
Need-to-know basis,
but you don't need to know.

186
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:54,789
Is that a fact?

187
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,358
Let's cut the crap out, Marcus.

188
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:00,762
I know you're interested.

189
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,468
I gave up that life
a long time ago.

190
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:11,304
I'm all my daughter's got left.

191
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:13,541
Yes.

192
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,077
But ten million dollars,

193
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:20,014
that's enough to take care
of you and Kimberley
for the rest of your life.

194
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:22,550
I mean, that will give her
the life that she deserves,

195
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,452
a good education, a trust fund.

196
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:31,391
It can't be easy being
a single parent these days.

197
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:36,798
I'll be expecting your call.

198
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,700
Let's talk soon, Mr. Garan.

199
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:42,503
Let's talk soon.

200
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:50,778
Hello?

201
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:09,997
Mr. Garan, Dr. Dean,
head of cardiac pediatrics.

202
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:11,899
Hey, Doc.
Nice to meet you.

203
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,572
What's wrong
with my daughter?

204
00:22:19,574 --> 00:22:21,242
Let's step over here.

205
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:33,120
I'm sorry, but Kimberley's scan
shows an abnormally large heart,

206
00:22:33,154 --> 00:22:36,824
specifically affecting
her lower chambers,
her ventricles.

207
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:41,262
I knew she had
a heart murmur, but--

208
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:43,898
No, this is much more
serious than that.

209
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:47,034
In fact, I daresay
she was misdiagnosed.

210
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:50,538
Her heart is deteriorating.

211
00:22:51,772 --> 00:22:55,643
This will lead
to heart failure.

212
00:22:59,412 --> 00:23:01,282
Daddy?

213
00:23:01,315 --> 00:23:02,650
Hey, kiddo.

214
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:07,387
- I'm right here.
- Daddy's right here.

215
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,190
Am I gonna be okay?

216
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:12,392
Yeah, of course.
You'll be fine.

217
00:23:13,094 --> 00:23:14,061
Hey...

218
00:23:15,296 --> 00:23:18,498
God is gonna look
over you, and so will I.

219
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:25,106
Hey, kiddo, look at me.

220
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,875
It's you and me
forever, right?

221
00:23:27,909 --> 00:23:29,110
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

222
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:10,483
- <i>Mr. Garan.</i>
- I'm in.

223
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:20,895
I knew you weren't finished.

224
00:24:22,763 --> 00:24:25,099
You're the best
the Alphabet Club ever had.

225
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,970
- So, who's the client?
- Jorg Drakos.

226
00:24:29,003 --> 00:24:30,738
What? You're kidding.

227
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,710
I doubt they even know
where he is.
Nobody's ever seen his face.

228
00:24:35,743 --> 00:24:37,144
You sure you want
a piece of that?

229
00:24:37,178 --> 00:24:38,212
No choice.

230
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:40,915
Someone wants him dead.
And I need the money.

231
00:24:40,948 --> 00:24:43,684
You've never been motivated
by money before.

232
00:24:44,285 --> 00:24:45,319
What's changed?

233
00:24:45,353 --> 00:24:46,721
This is different.

234
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:53,127
Are you okay?

235
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,929
'Cause I know you've been
obsessing about Karla's death

236
00:24:54,962 --> 00:24:57,098
and trying to find out
who might have killed her.

237
00:24:58,232 --> 00:24:59,400
Obsessing?

238
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:01,502
I didn't mean it like that
and you know it.

239
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:03,170
I loved her like a sister, man.

240
00:25:04,305 --> 00:25:07,975
It's just-- I think
it was a matter of her
being at the wrong place

241
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:10,144
- at the wrong time.
- It's Kimberley.

242
00:25:11,245 --> 00:25:13,881
- What?
- It's Kimberley.

243
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:16,684
She's sick.

244
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,756
She needs a new heart.

245
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:25,960
And what I have
just won't cover it.

246
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:29,063
I'm sorry.

247
00:25:30,765 --> 00:25:32,533
Look, I got a little
something tucked away.

248
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:35,069
- It's yours if you need it.
- I appreciate that.

249
00:25:35,903 --> 00:25:38,839
I really do.
But you have a family too.

250
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:42,610
I got to do this.

251
00:25:42,643 --> 00:25:45,346
And it's the only way
I know how.

252
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:46,714
I understand.

253
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:49,717
Okay.

254
00:25:51,352 --> 00:25:54,622
I need a complete rundown
on Drakos.

255
00:25:55,256 --> 00:25:56,424
Problem is,

256
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:59,460
I don't have
my security clearance anymore.

257
00:25:59,493 --> 00:26:00,661
Right.

258
00:26:02,463 --> 00:26:03,998
Let me see what I can do.

259
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:08,102
So, where are they sending you?

260
00:26:49,944 --> 00:26:52,046
Mr. Garan.

261
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,951
I am so happy
you decided to come.

262
00:26:57,618 --> 00:27:00,888
Mr. Korza, one last hurrah.

263
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:01,956
Indeed.

264
00:27:02,591 --> 00:27:04,859
You're expected
in the penthouse.

265
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:07,695
My assistant, Mrs. Ueno,

266
00:27:07,728 --> 00:27:09,564
is waiting for us
at the elevator.

267
00:27:09,598 --> 00:27:11,165
Let's get started.

268
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:37,858
What's this?

269
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:39,628
I thought
I was working alone.

270
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:43,330
Don't get your knickers
in a twist, Mr. Garan.
All in good time.

271
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:45,266
All in good time.

272
00:28:02,216 --> 00:28:05,654
Well, I'm glad
you all can make it.

273
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:09,890

you all are to get started.

I was gonna be part of a team.

276

I work alone.

277
00:28:17,231 --> 00:28:19,934
I don't need these lame ducks
getting in my way.

278
00:28:19,967 --> 00:28:21,168
Hmpf.

279
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:23,971
Man, who you calling
a "lame duck"?

280
00:28:24,639 --> 00:28:26,840

- Oh, really now?

00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:50,277
Okay, wait,
you want us to compete

351
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,847
to see which one of us
can get to him first.

352
00:31:52,881 --> 00:31:54,148
Yes.

353
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:59,420
Well, this should be fun.

354
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:01,989
No, no. I'm out.

355
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:04,626
Oh, this game
you'll play, Mr. Hebron.

356
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:08,663
- Oh, yeah? Why is that?
- Mr. Hebron.

357
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,166
See, I think you should
change your mind.

358
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:15,135
It's not really a good idea.

359
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,404
You lied to us
in the beginning.

360
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,542
The way I see it
is I don't know you.

361
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:24,011
I don't know your boss.
And I sure as hell
don't trust you.

362
00:32:24,044 --> 00:32:25,713
Anybody else
care to join?

363
00:32:27,615 --> 00:32:28,650
Killer queen?

364
00:32:29,349 --> 00:32:30,384
Not I.

365
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:31,619
Green Mile?

366
00:32:32,654 --> 00:32:33,621
No?

367
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:37,859
See you, mate.

368
00:32:37,892 --> 00:32:39,159
I'm out.

369
00:32:44,998 --> 00:32:47,367
I told you, mate.

370
00:32:47,735 --> 00:32:49,403
That'll be the day.
I told you that.

371
00:32:57,211 --> 00:32:59,279
<i>Now you know how serious I am.</i>

372
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,382
<i>Nobody leaves</i>
<i>until the game is finished.</i>

373
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:04,318
His bloody head's
off his shoulders.

374
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:07,622
- You deceived us.
- <i>Maybe.</i>

375
00:33:07,655 --> 00:33:08,623
Maybe.

376
00:33:09,691 --> 00:33:12,493
But I expect you all to play
to the best of your abilities.

377
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:14,929
<i>Your lives depend on it.</i>
<i>You understand me?</i>

378
00:33:14,963 --> 00:33:17,464
We don't even know
what Drakos looks like.

379
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,100
Sure you do.

380
00:33:23,036 --> 00:33:26,373
You are Drakos-san.

381
00:33:30,545 --> 00:33:31,579
I am.

382
00:33:35,249 --> 00:33:37,050
Wait, I'm not getting this.

383
00:33:37,084 --> 00:33:39,052
Why hire us to kill you?

384
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:41,255
Why?

385
00:33:41,856 --> 00:33:43,423
I love "why" questions.

386
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:46,661
What does it all mean?

387
00:33:47,494 --> 00:33:49,396
<i>I'm the best.</i>
<i>I've done it all.</i>

388
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,066
<i>I've conquered it all.</i>

389
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:55,503
<i>Except for one thing.</i>

390
00:33:56,838 --> 00:33:59,273
The elimination of my peers.

391
00:33:59,941 --> 00:34:03,143
<i>You, the other assassins,</i>

392
00:34:03,176 --> 00:34:04,812
to see who really is the best.

393
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:10,785
And you expect us
to go along with that?

394
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,353
Is that right?

395
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:17,257
Well, you could ask Mr. Hebron
that question.

396
00:34:19,761 --> 00:34:21,428
I trust you understand.

397
00:34:24,164 --> 00:34:25,567
The job is simple.

398
00:34:26,868 --> 00:34:29,236
To kill me, King of Killers.

399
00:34:29,837 --> 00:34:31,238
How fun does that sound?

400
00:34:36,544 --> 00:34:38,445
<i>But I want you to get</i>
<i>some rest first.</i>

401
00:34:38,478 --> 00:34:40,048
Mr. Korza is gonna
hand you a card,

402
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,749
give you access
to my entire facility.

403
00:34:41,783 --> 00:34:43,283
It's a wonderful place.

404
00:34:43,317 --> 00:34:44,852
You can sleep, you can eat,

405
00:34:44,886 --> 00:34:46,521
you can work out
to your heart's content.

406
00:34:46,554 --> 00:34:47,755
Why, thank you.

407
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:50,658
In 24 hours, you have one job,

408
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:53,327
and that is to kill me,

409
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,665
or I can guarantee
I will kill you.

410
00:34:58,766 --> 00:35:01,636
<i>Now, we have a light</i>
<i>supper and, uh, tea</i>

411
00:35:01,669 --> 00:35:03,170
<i>in the lobby</i>
<i>of the hotel later.</i>

412
00:35:03,203 --> 00:35:04,806
<i>I expect all of you</i>
<i>to be there.</i>

413
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:08,442
See you later.

414
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:17,585
Well, I hope
that was informative.

415
00:35:19,186 --> 00:35:23,057
You have 24 hours to prepare.

416
00:35:23,091 --> 00:35:26,259
Please, use your time wisely,

417
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:30,130
'cause it may be the last time
you have left on this earth.

418
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:36,738
And, uh, if anyone else
should have any ideas

419
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:39,272
to depart this event early,

420
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:41,141
just remember one thing,

421
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:44,746
someone is always watching.

422
00:36:57,118 --> 00:36:59,486
Curiosity killed
the cat, you know.

423
00:37:01,689 --> 00:37:04,959
Lucky for you, Asha.
You always land on your feet.

424
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:07,461
Lucky me.

425
00:37:09,097 --> 00:37:11,165
It's good
to see you, Garan.

426
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,600
Stop lying.

427
00:37:13,768 --> 00:37:16,738
Last time we saw each other,
you tried to take me out.

428
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:18,305
Well, you deserved it.

429
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,274
Playing doubles
with the Alphabet Squad

430
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:25,513
doesn't exactly make
for influencing people
or making new friends.

431
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:28,950
But I forgive you.

432
00:37:28,983 --> 00:37:32,920
So, why are you here?

433
00:37:32,954 --> 00:37:33,988
Listen,

434
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:38,526
I heard about Karla.

435
00:37:40,962 --> 00:37:42,262
Let's not.

436
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:43,798
Okay.

437
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:47,568
Then business it is.

438
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:49,704
What do you know about Drakos?

439
00:37:50,303 --> 00:37:54,075
Other than he's
standing in my way
of ten million dollars. Nothing.

440
00:37:54,108 --> 00:37:55,342
Really?

441
00:37:56,844 --> 00:37:58,045
Now who's lying?

442
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:01,649
Okay.

443
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:06,087
What I know is
he's holding all the cards.

444
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,822
His turf, his rules.

445
00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:12,026
And if I didn't know any better,
I'd say that's not a window.

446
00:38:15,797 --> 00:38:17,297
A monitor.

447
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:19,901
Doesn't matter.

448
00:38:20,568 --> 00:38:22,302
I have nothing to hide.

449
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:24,572
Just everything to lose.

450
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:29,977
- All I know is I need to win.
- To win...

451
00:38:30,778 --> 00:38:32,345
that prize.

452
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:38,653
We'll see.

453
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,323
Death is just a part of life.

454
00:39:13,054 --> 00:39:14,088
What is this?

455
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:18,358
He's our host,
showing us a good time

456
00:39:19,293 --> 00:39:22,864
right before one of us
takes him out.

457
00:39:24,065 --> 00:39:25,199
Sure.

458
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:26,934
I'd love a nice spot of tea

459
00:39:26,968 --> 00:39:28,202
before I carve my name

460
00:39:28,236 --> 00:39:29,604
into his chest.

461
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:36,143
Contestants,

462
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:39,981
it is with great pleasure

463
00:39:40,014 --> 00:39:42,482
that the esteemed Mr. Drakos

464
00:39:42,516 --> 00:39:44,952
welcomes you to Japan.

465
00:39:45,953 --> 00:39:50,691
This is a simple dinner
like a thank you

466
00:39:50,725 --> 00:39:53,393
for being competitors
in our event.

467
00:39:54,362 --> 00:39:57,131
Or perhaps, for some of you,

468
00:39:58,165 --> 00:39:59,634
a last supper.

469
00:40:03,304 --> 00:40:05,606
What? We get a door prize too?

470
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,275
So, where is Drakos?

471
00:40:07,742 --> 00:40:09,710
<i>I am here.</i>

472
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:14,148
<i>Call me superstitious,</i>
<i>but I don't like to see</i>
<i>the participants</i>

473
00:40:14,181 --> 00:40:15,516
<i>before the event.</i>

474
00:40:16,884 --> 00:40:19,320
<i>Kind of like the groom</i>
<i>shouldn't see the bride</i>
<i>before the wedding.</i>

475
00:40:19,353 --> 00:40:21,188
You leave
nothing to chance.

476
00:40:21,222 --> 00:40:22,690
<i>You catch on quick.</i>

477
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:25,492
<i>But never mind</i>
<i>all that for now.</i>

478
00:40:26,093 --> 00:40:30,031
<i>Tonight, I want you to enjoy</i>
<i>a well-deserved respite.</i>
<i>Agreed?</i>

479
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:32,566
<i>A toast.</i>

480
00:40:33,334 --> 00:40:34,835
Gentlemen and lady.

481
00:40:35,703 --> 00:40:37,838
<i>Thank you for accepting</i>
<i>my offer.</i>

482
00:40:39,273 --> 00:40:40,541
<i>Welcome to Japan.</i>

483
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:43,044
May we fight hard

484
00:40:44,378 --> 00:40:45,680
and die with honor.

485
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:51,085
<i>Cheers. Till tomorrow.</i>

486
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:09,971
Enjoy your dinner.

487
00:41:11,072 --> 00:41:12,106
Until later.

488
00:41:23,483 --> 00:41:26,120
You know,
it's really interesting.

489
00:41:26,787 --> 00:41:29,489
Here we are,
the best in the world
at what we do.

490
00:41:29,523 --> 00:41:31,726
And none of us
have ever really met.

491
00:41:32,293 --> 00:41:33,928
Some of us have.

492
00:41:34,628 --> 00:41:35,997
A lifetime ago.

493
00:41:38,899 --> 00:41:39,867
Yeah.

494
00:41:40,835 --> 00:41:44,238
It's a small world we live in,
isn't it, boys?

495
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:46,040
Reputations
are like that.

496
00:41:46,073 --> 00:41:50,544
CIA, FBI, NSA, MI6.

497
00:41:50,578 --> 00:41:52,446
They always make sure
we're informed,

498
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,749
even if you're
on the other side.

499
00:41:54,782 --> 00:41:56,484
Something doesn't sit right.

500
00:41:56,517 --> 00:42:01,789
I'm thinking this contest
has nothing to do
with money, or ego.

501
00:42:02,656 --> 00:42:03,958
She ain't wrong.

502
00:42:04,558 --> 00:42:06,794
What's this old boy up to? Hmm?

503
00:42:06,827 --> 00:42:08,529
Don't look a gift horse
in the mouth,

504
00:42:08,562 --> 00:42:10,998
fool and his money
will soon part,

505
00:42:11,032 --> 00:42:14,402
and this fool
will make sure it does.

506
00:42:14,435 --> 00:42:16,570
We're all, uh, happy
with that, are we?

507
00:42:16,604 --> 00:42:18,873
I think our boy here
is looking for a thrill.

508
00:42:18,906 --> 00:42:21,575
Is he, mate?
Is that what he's after?

509
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:24,145
- Do you know something we don't know?
-  - Please, please,

510
00:42:24,178 --> 00:42:25,579
please, please.

511
00:42:25,613 --> 00:42:27,048
Think about it.

512
00:42:27,081 --> 00:42:29,283
How is this different
than any other contract

513
00:42:29,316 --> 00:42:31,218
we've ever taken, huh?

514
00:42:35,256 --> 00:42:36,624
Have to take this.

515
00:42:38,492 --> 00:42:39,894
Is it that important?

516
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:42,496
So, how's she doing?

517
00:42:42,531 --> 00:42:43,697
<i>Oh, she's fine.</i>

518
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:45,633
<i>She just wanted</i>
<i>to say good night.</i>

519
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:47,868
<i>Good night,</i>
<i>Daddy. I love you.</i>

520
00:42:47,902 --> 00:42:50,638
I love you to the moon
and back and back again.

521
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:52,440
Good night, Peanut.

522
00:42:52,473 --> 00:42:53,874
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

523
00:42:53,908 --> 00:42:57,044
As soon as I can, kiddo.
As soon as I can.

524
00:42:58,212 --> 00:42:59,647
<i>I miss you.</i>

525
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,416
Oh, I miss you so much.

526
00:43:02,983 --> 00:43:06,555
Okay? Sweet dreams.
I'll see you very soon.

527
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:07,888
<i>Bye.</i>

528
00:43:10,324 --> 00:43:11,859
Asha, I know you're there.

529
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:15,696
Now, that was beautiful.

530
00:43:16,565 --> 00:43:17,731
So...

531
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:21,402
how should we play this game?

532
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:23,370
This is the same game
we've always played.

533
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:25,739
Wow.

534
00:43:26,575 --> 00:43:29,578
You really have changed,
haven't you?

535
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:30,845
What are you doing?

536
00:43:30,878 --> 00:43:34,982
I'm just picking up
where we left off.

537
00:43:39,253 --> 00:43:43,057
The less of us there are,
the better the chance
of winning.

538
00:43:54,034 --> 00:43:56,337
You don't have to do this.
It's not about us.

539
00:43:57,572 --> 00:43:59,140
Don't flatter yourself.

540
00:44:24,031 --> 00:44:28,102
So, I guess
you don't always land
on your feet now, do you?

541
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,389
<i>Daddy,</i>
<i>I'm scared. I miss Mommy.</i>

542
00:45:22,423 --> 00:45:23,757
Oh, kiddo.

543
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:29,930
Listen, your Mommy
is an angel now
and she lives in the stars.

544
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:33,400
So anytime you miss Mommy,
all you have to do,

545
00:45:33,434 --> 00:45:37,338
you look up at the stars
and you can talk to her.

546
00:45:38,005 --> 00:45:40,941
And know that she's always
looking over you.

547
00:45:40,975 --> 00:45:42,743
Okay? So, here's
what we're gonna do.

548
00:45:43,444 --> 00:45:44,979
Look at this star.

549
00:45:45,012 --> 00:45:46,981
I'm gonna put some stars
right above your bed.

550
00:45:47,014 --> 00:45:48,949
So anytime
you wanna talk to Mommy,

551
00:45:48,983 --> 00:45:52,119
all you have to do is look up
and talk to her.

552
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:25,152
You don't say much,
do you?

553
00:46:26,387 --> 00:46:30,391
Only when there is something
that needs to be said.

554
00:46:32,393 --> 00:46:33,494
Contestants.

555
00:46:36,163 --> 00:46:40,602
I trust we are all well-rested
and refreshed.

556
00:46:41,101 --> 00:46:42,771
Just eager to get started.

557
00:46:43,237 --> 00:46:46,340
So you should be, Mr. Chord.
So you should be.

558
00:46:47,408 --> 00:46:52,246
Now, we of course know
the exact tool you use
in your line of work,

559
00:46:53,414 --> 00:46:54,549
down to the blade

560
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:57,451
and to your caliber.

561
00:46:59,386 --> 00:47:02,923
Here, you will find
everything you need.

562
00:47:04,091 --> 00:47:08,095
Please come
and feast your eyes.

563
00:47:19,873 --> 00:47:22,042
That's what I'm talking about.

564
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:28,583
Not the sniper rifle
I'm used to. But this will do.

565
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:42,697
Well, I trust they're all
to your satisfaction?

566
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:43,997
Are they ever?

567
00:47:44,031 --> 00:47:46,433
So, how does this work?

568
00:47:46,467 --> 00:47:48,235
- Is it a game of hide
and seek, or what?

569
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:50,505
In a manner of speaking, yes.

570
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,744
<i>You're all gonna draw a coin</i>
<i>from that bag,</i>

571
00:47:55,777 --> 00:47:58,078
<i>determine which order</i>
<i>you'll face me.</i>

572
00:47:58,613 --> 00:47:59,647
<i>Low coin goes first.</i>

573
00:48:00,481 --> 00:48:02,216
High coin goes last.

574
00:48:04,652 --> 00:48:06,453
Please, take one.

575
00:48:12,192 --> 00:48:13,160
Five.

576
00:48:15,496 --> 00:48:16,463
Seven.

577
00:48:18,867 --> 00:48:20,234
Eight.

578
00:48:23,738 --> 00:48:25,072
Two.

579
00:48:28,442 --> 00:48:29,644
Damn, six.

580
00:48:32,547 --> 00:48:33,515
Tsk.

581
00:48:34,481 --> 00:48:35,583
I guess I go first.

582
00:48:35,617 --> 00:48:36,917
No, you're not.

583
00:48:41,054 --> 00:48:43,525
And when I get back...

584
00:48:43,558 --> 00:48:44,992
...dinner's on me.

585
00:48:55,936 --> 00:48:57,404
If he makes it back.

586
00:49:15,422 --> 00:49:16,390
Hey.

587
00:49:17,859 --> 00:49:19,092
Look at this.

588
00:49:27,702 --> 00:49:30,437
<i>Ah, Angus, going first.</i>

589
00:49:30,471 --> 00:49:33,407
<i>Always the good guy.</i>
<i>Always the hero.</i>

590
00:49:35,944 --> 00:49:37,344
<i>Ain't that right?</i>

591
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:40,481
<i>But this time, rushing in</i>
<i>to save the day</i>

592
00:49:40,515 --> 00:49:42,316
<i>might be the very</i>
<i>last thing you do.</i>

593
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:44,652
Drakos won't
make this one easy.

594
00:49:45,587 --> 00:49:47,087
He's not supposed to.

595
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:24,559
What's he doing?

596
00:50:28,228 --> 00:50:29,631
What's going on here?

597
00:50:33,768 --> 00:50:35,102
It's a trap.

598
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:12,472
What's he doing?

599
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:16,076
I mean...

600
00:51:35,063 --> 00:51:36,598
He's lost already.

601
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:37,966
You are right.

602
00:51:55,415 --> 00:51:56,651
He's fast.

603
00:51:59,654 --> 00:52:01,488
You thought this was
gonna be easy, didn't ya?

604
00:52:26,547 --> 00:52:27,582
Where are you?

605
00:52:31,886 --> 00:52:33,021
Where are you?

606
00:52:38,526 --> 00:52:39,727
Where are you?

607
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:20,200
I will kill you.

608
00:53:20,668 --> 00:53:21,869
Yeah.

609
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:47,795
<i>Y'all know you're never</i>
<i>gonna win this.</i>

610
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:49,463
But I love your spirit.

611
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,274
We're going about this
the wrong way.

612
00:54:03,144 --> 00:54:05,445
Look at the terminology he uses,

613
00:54:05,479 --> 00:54:07,915
the layout
of the floors.

614
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:09,249
He set this whole thing up.

615
00:54:09,282 --> 00:54:11,152
It's a chess game.
We know this.

616
00:54:11,185 --> 00:54:14,021
Not a chess game.
A game of chance.

617
00:54:15,123 --> 00:54:17,091
Don't you get it?
He's a gambler,

618
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:19,794
and gamblers
love high stakes.

619
00:54:21,294 --> 00:54:22,764
We can't win...

620
00:54:24,132 --> 00:54:26,701
'cause the house always wins.

621
00:54:26,734 --> 00:54:27,702
Gentlemen.

622
00:54:27,735 --> 00:54:28,903
And lady.

623
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:30,571
Do we have a problem here?

624
00:54:31,471 --> 00:54:33,775
We have to change
the rules on him.

625
00:54:33,808 --> 00:54:34,642
How?

626
00:54:34,675 --> 00:54:37,477
We tell him
we'll only continue

627
00:54:37,512 --> 00:54:39,479
if he takes on
all of us at once.

628
00:54:41,381 --> 00:54:43,117
- What?
- He'll never go for it.

629
00:54:43,151 --> 00:54:47,522
Maybe. But I know
that the only way
we survive this

630
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:50,490
is if we work together.

631
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,727
Then we split the prize.

632
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:58,566
- I concur.
- So do I.

633
00:54:59,233 --> 00:55:00,400
Ren?

634
00:55:05,438 --> 00:55:06,707
I think it's weak.

635
00:55:06,741 --> 00:55:08,441
So you have
a better idea?

636
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:12,280
Yeah. We scrap,
and we find out
who's the best.

637
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:14,081
Perfect. Then you go next.

638
00:55:14,115 --> 00:55:16,117
Whoa, big fella.
It's not my turn.

639
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:21,421
Well, you're the only one
who wants to keep on fighting
in this death trap.

640
00:55:21,454 --> 00:55:23,558
So, you wanna be a fool?

641
00:55:24,324 --> 00:55:26,127
You know what?
Knock yourself out.

642
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,495
- You're a coward.
- <i>Who's next?</i>

643
00:55:28,529 --> 00:55:29,997
You're not even worth it.

644
00:55:30,463 --> 00:55:31,766
<i>I don't have all day.</i>

645
00:55:32,934 --> 00:55:34,502
I don't care who it is.

646
00:55:34,535 --> 00:55:36,938
But someone has got to get
in the elevator.

647
00:55:38,873 --> 00:55:41,075
You led us here
under false pretenses.

648
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:46,280
We were led to believe
we'd be hunting you
under much different conditions.

649
00:55:46,314 --> 00:55:47,982
The game is rigged.

650
00:55:48,448 --> 00:55:51,719
Like the Greeks say,
the rules are the rules.

651
00:55:51,752 --> 00:55:56,090
And I say these rules
are the only way you can win.

652
00:55:56,123 --> 00:55:57,490
But that's okay.

653
00:55:58,593 --> 00:55:59,994
I have a proposition for you.

654
00:56:00,862 --> 00:56:05,700
After all, you are a gentleman
and a gamesman, right?

655
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:09,237
Not exactly. But I'll bite.

656
00:56:09,804 --> 00:56:12,807
All of us versus you
simultaneously.

657
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,743
No deal. That's not
how the game is played.

658
00:56:16,777 --> 00:56:18,312
<i>So, you,</i>

659
00:56:18,346 --> 00:56:21,448
the King of Killers,
is admitting he can't win?

660
00:56:22,116 --> 00:56:24,484
Because if that's the case,
you're not the best.

661
00:56:24,986 --> 00:56:28,222
<i>You had to stack the deck</i>
<i>in order to achieve victory,</i>

662
00:56:28,256 --> 00:56:29,557
which...

663
00:56:30,691 --> 00:56:35,796
really isn't the game of skill
you relish so much now, is it?

664
00:56:38,733 --> 00:56:42,670
Now the other way, my way,
is a true game of skill.

665
00:56:42,703 --> 00:56:45,706
Our numbers versus your traps.

666
00:56:49,442 --> 00:56:52,179
Come on, Drakos,
you're the king.

667
00:56:54,749 --> 00:56:57,417
Does the king care
to make a wager?

668
00:57:00,321 --> 00:57:01,923
Is this psychology?

669
00:57:03,057 --> 00:57:04,191
I think I like it.

670
00:57:07,328 --> 00:57:08,696
You have a deal.

671
00:57:08,729 --> 00:57:11,098
- Let's go.
- Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

672
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:14,068
I do have one wrinkle.

673
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:16,637
Of course, you do.

674
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:18,839
Four.

675
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,142
<i>I'll only take four of you.</i>

676
00:57:21,175 --> 00:57:24,512
So, one of us has to stay here.

677
00:57:24,545 --> 00:57:27,581
Well, I think you know me
a little better than that.

678
00:57:28,816 --> 00:57:30,785
<i>One of you has</i>
<i>to be eliminated.</i>

679
00:57:32,153 --> 00:57:33,821
<i>One of you has to die,</i>

680
00:57:34,322 --> 00:57:36,057
<i>or all of you have to die.</i>

681
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:37,658
Your choice.

682
00:57:51,138 --> 00:57:53,107
Wife killer!

683
00:57:57,144 --> 00:57:58,746
How dare you!

684
00:58:00,348 --> 00:58:02,049
Guys, guys!

685
00:58:05,553 --> 00:58:07,321
I hate to break this up.

686
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:10,124
Chord's gone.

687
00:58:18,532 --> 00:58:21,102
<i>They say that all</i>
<i>those horrible things</i>
<i>you did as an operative</i>

688
00:58:21,135 --> 00:58:22,536
<i>finally got to you.</i>

689
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:25,306
<i>And after so many years</i>
<i>of decorated service,</i>

690
00:58:25,339 --> 00:58:26,640
<i>that's why you quit.</i>

691
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:30,444
<i>But did you, Chord?</i>

692
00:58:30,478 --> 00:58:32,313
<i>Did you really walk away</i>
<i>from the game?</i>

693
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:33,714
<i>I don't think so.</i>

694
00:58:33,748 --> 00:58:36,083
<i>Once a player, always a player.</i>

695
00:58:36,117 --> 00:58:37,618
<i>Just a different team.</i>

696
00:58:37,651 --> 00:58:39,787
<i>So why walk away</i>
<i>from this team too?</i>

697
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:42,490
<i>You looking</i>
<i>for absolution, Chord?</i>

698
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:43,724
<i>Well, come and get it.</i>

699
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:57,605
Where are you hiding this time?

700
00:59:02,977 --> 00:59:04,045
Drakos!

701
00:59:04,945 --> 00:59:06,047
Where are you?

702
00:59:07,281 --> 00:59:08,582
You scared?

703
00:59:17,758 --> 00:59:19,660
It's the calm before the storm.

704
00:59:39,447 --> 00:59:41,082
What's he reacting to?

705
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:43,717
I don't know.

706
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:03,257
Now we begin.

707
01:02:17,071 --> 01:02:19,907
You heard the man. Gear up.

708
01:02:20,508 --> 01:02:22,109
Cellphones on radio mode.

709
01:02:23,777 --> 01:02:25,179
Aye, Cap.

710
01:02:30,017 --> 01:02:32,319
I believe this
is yours, Mr. Garan.

711
01:02:57,945 --> 01:03:01,248
I am not sure we should
completely split up.

712
01:03:02,082 --> 01:03:04,785
Ren's right.
We work as a unit.

713
01:03:04,818 --> 01:03:06,153
Or else he'll pick us off
one by one.

714
01:03:06,186 --> 01:03:08,188
Oh, bugger that.

715
01:03:12,793 --> 01:03:14,161
See ya, kids.

716
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:18,866
Let's go.

717
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,875
Everyone still there?

718
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:04,345
Barely.

719
01:04:12,853 --> 01:04:15,089
Let's... let's try
to find our way

720
01:04:15,122 --> 01:04:17,891
<i>back to each other.</i>

721
01:04:18,459 --> 01:04:19,426
Fuck!

722
01:04:24,898 --> 01:04:26,367
How do we do that?

723
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,503
We don't know where we are.

724
01:04:28,536 --> 01:04:31,773
<i>Clear out each floor.</i>
<i>Head down if you can.</i>

725
01:04:31,806 --> 01:04:34,341
That is a lot of rooms.

726
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:43,083
I wonder how long it took him
to put this rat race together.

727
01:04:43,117 --> 01:04:45,886
<i>I'm sure he took</i>
<i>his sweet-ass time.</i>

728
01:04:46,487 --> 01:04:47,555
And money.

729
01:04:48,523 --> 01:04:49,624
Obviously.

730
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:02,102
He is not going
to let us escape.

731
01:05:02,136 --> 01:05:03,571
<i>That's the point.</i>

732
01:06:35,028 --> 01:06:37,064
Just stay focused.

733
01:06:38,967 --> 01:06:41,001
<i>Let's see</i>
<i>if we can flush him out.</i>

734
01:06:41,034 --> 01:06:43,605
Easier said than done.

735
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:52,514
<i>What happened to you, Asha?</i>

736
01:06:52,547 --> 01:06:54,081
<i>What turned you?</i>

737
01:06:54,114 --> 01:06:55,750
<i>You believed in the cause.</i>

738
01:07:07,294 --> 01:07:10,330
<i>When greed is your God,</i>
<i>you can never be good enough.</i>

739
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:12,466
<i>Not to beat me.</i>

740
01:07:30,752 --> 01:07:31,953
Here we go.

741
01:07:36,524 --> 01:07:39,226
You're a really
good assassin, Asha.

742
01:07:39,259 --> 01:07:42,496
Maybe the best,
just not good enough.

743
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:45,465
We'll see about that.

744
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:21,903
Darkness makes you weak.

745
01:08:46,293 --> 01:08:49,731
Asha, Asha,
what's going on?

746
01:09:36,376 --> 01:09:39,547
Like I said, not good enough.

747
01:09:52,827 --> 01:09:55,697
<i>Garan, Asha.</i>

748
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:56,798
She's gone.

749
01:10:12,312 --> 01:10:13,881
I'll see you again, Asha.

750
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:16,584
Someday.

751
01:10:27,061 --> 01:10:29,429
<i>You went down</i>
<i>the path of revenge</i>

752
01:10:29,463 --> 01:10:31,599
<i>thinking you were righteous.</i>

753
01:10:31,632 --> 01:10:34,434
<i>But you got lost, didn't you?</i>

754
01:10:34,468 --> 01:10:36,170
<i>Too many debts owed</i>
<i>to the wrong people.</i>

755
01:10:36,204 --> 01:10:40,340
<i>You spilled a lot</i>
<i>of innocent blood</i>
<i>looking for me.</i>

756
01:10:41,609 --> 01:10:42,944
Well, here I am,

757
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:46,514
Mr. Ren.

758
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:51,686
Drakos-san.

759
01:10:53,821 --> 01:10:55,022
We meet at last.

760
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:59,994
Your tricks and illusions
will not work on me.

761
01:11:00,695 --> 01:11:03,330
Oh, you have
a very keen mind,

762
01:11:03,363 --> 01:11:06,934
just like your father,
Sugahiro.

763
01:11:08,035 --> 01:11:09,871
Killed by your hand.

764
01:11:14,142 --> 01:11:18,012
I don't think you understand
the true nature
of the <i>tetsu,</i> right?

765
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:20,280
You and I
are very much alike.

766
01:11:20,313 --> 01:11:22,482
We are nothing alike.

767
01:11:23,117 --> 01:11:25,219
You kill for sport.

768
01:11:25,253 --> 01:11:27,221
I work for the end.

769
01:11:27,255 --> 01:11:28,956
And yet, here you are!

770
01:11:30,658 --> 01:11:33,895
Accepting my invitation...

771
01:11:33,928 --> 01:11:35,362
...for sport.

772
01:11:35,395 --> 01:11:40,568
You have dishonored
the <i>tetsu</i> and yourself.

773
01:11:43,704 --> 01:11:47,508
And tell me, how much
did you honor cost?

774
01:11:50,745 --> 01:11:51,712
Ren.

775
01:11:54,949 --> 01:11:55,917
Ren!

776
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:59,386
What's going on, Ren?

777
01:12:10,264 --> 01:12:11,299
Come on!

778
01:13:24,906 --> 01:13:25,873
Wait!

779
01:13:59,472 --> 01:14:01,976
<i>Daddy,</i>
<i>I'm scared. I miss Mommy.</i>

780
01:14:03,476 --> 01:14:04,812
- <i>Marcus?</i>
- Daddy!

781
01:15:15,149 --> 01:15:16,250
<i>Ren.</i>

782
01:15:51,252 --> 01:15:53,587
Now, that was
a hell of a chess game.

783
01:15:56,525 --> 01:15:58,959
This was never
a true chess game.

784
01:16:00,494 --> 01:16:02,129
You always
controlled the board.

785
01:16:02,163 --> 01:16:06,333
That's why you, me,
we're the last ones standing.

786
01:16:10,304 --> 01:16:13,207
You know the origin
of the word "assassin,"
Mr. Garan?

787
01:16:16,844 --> 01:16:19,447
A thousand years ago,
an Arab sultan
employed hundreds of men

788
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,882
to do his clandestine bidding.

789
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:22,750
Dirty work.

790
01:16:23,584 --> 01:16:28,189
To keep 'em loyal
and to trust them,
he fed them cakes of hashish.

791
01:16:30,525 --> 01:16:33,594
He told them the euphoria
that they were feeling,
the high,

792
01:16:34,328 --> 01:16:36,764
was a little slice of heaven
that they would experience

793
01:16:36,797 --> 01:16:38,899
if they died in his service.

794
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:42,203
They were called
the "Hashashins."

795
01:16:43,003 --> 01:16:45,773
Later, that evolved
to "assassin."

796
01:16:46,607 --> 01:16:48,375
Now, isn't that fascinating?

797
01:16:50,344 --> 01:16:52,079
I appreciate the history lesson.

798
01:17:02,857 --> 01:17:04,758
You should enjoy this moment.

799
01:17:06,727 --> 01:17:09,864
This is the last bit of euphoria
you'll ever feel.

800
01:17:14,401 --> 01:17:15,936
I knew it was gonna be you.

801
01:17:16,804 --> 01:17:19,073
I did. I always knew
you were the one

802
01:17:19,106 --> 01:17:21,242
who had the skills
to make it this far.

803
01:17:23,512 --> 01:17:24,678
I have a little confession too.

804
01:17:24,712 --> 01:17:26,213
There were a couple
of times where, uh,

805
01:17:26,247 --> 01:17:29,283
you got the assignments
and the contracts that I wanted.

806
01:17:30,484 --> 01:17:34,355
All this, all of this
'cause I beat you
out of a contract?

807
01:17:34,388 --> 01:17:36,924
No. Of course not.

808
01:17:38,692 --> 01:17:41,028
But I do have an insatiable
desire to be the best.

809
01:17:42,029 --> 01:17:43,063
Number one.

810
01:17:43,731 --> 01:17:45,866
My mother said
I was too competitive.

811
01:17:47,134 --> 01:17:51,105
But you see now, I have
the opportunity to prove
that to myself, don't I?

812
01:17:53,307 --> 01:17:54,808
I never wanted this.

813
01:17:55,709 --> 01:17:58,078
Never wanted to be
the world's best assassin,

814
01:17:58,712 --> 01:18:00,147
the King of Killers.

815
01:18:01,382 --> 01:18:02,883
What does that even mean?

816
01:18:05,452 --> 01:18:08,455
You know, it's like Asha said.

817
01:18:08,489 --> 01:18:11,792
Death is just part of life.

818
01:18:23,572 --> 01:18:24,805
So be it.

819
01:18:50,731 --> 01:18:52,399
Told you I was competitive.

820
01:19:47,855 --> 01:19:50,057
<i>Let's talk about</i>
<i>your wife for a moment.</i>

821
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:51,792
<i>What was she doing</i>
<i>there that night?</i>

822
01:19:51,825 --> 01:19:53,260
<i>How didn't you see her early?</i>

823
01:19:53,294 --> 01:19:56,030
<i>What could you</i>
<i>have done to save her?</i>

824
01:19:56,063 --> 01:19:58,065
<i>If only you hadn't hidden</i>
<i>all this from her.</i>

825
01:19:58,098 --> 01:20:00,901
<i>If you had told her the truth,</i>
<i>she might still be alive.</i>

826
01:20:00,934 --> 01:20:05,239
<i>You carry the guilt</i>
<i>of that night</i>
<i>every second of every day.</i>

827
01:20:05,272 --> 01:20:07,207
<i>I know what it's like</i>
<i>to lose someone close to you,</i>

828
01:20:07,241 --> 01:20:10,512
<i>someone you can never get back,</i>
<i>how it could tear you.</i>

829
01:20:10,545 --> 01:20:12,146
<i>Yet, you still come here.</i>

830
01:20:12,179 --> 01:20:14,516
<i>And you risk leaving</i>
<i>your daughter,</i>
<i>making her an orphan.</i>

831
01:20:14,549 --> 01:20:17,184
<i>Why? To try and save</i>
<i>the one you have left.</i>

832
01:20:17,217 --> 01:20:18,886
<i>But you have to kill me</i>
<i>to do that.</i>

833
01:20:18,919 --> 01:20:21,656
Before I kill you!

834
01:20:58,292 --> 01:20:59,627
The King does bleed.

835
01:22:04,124 --> 01:22:06,493
Die!

836
01:22:14,101 --> 01:22:16,136
Looks like we have a victor.

837
01:22:21,543 --> 01:22:23,511
Congratulations, Mr. Garan.

838
01:22:27,181 --> 01:22:28,449
The King of Killers.

839
01:22:29,851 --> 01:22:32,085
I believe this is yours.

840
01:22:39,293 --> 01:22:40,394
What's this?

841
01:22:42,362 --> 01:22:43,631
It's your prize.

842
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:50,839
That card will give you
access to a bank account
in the Caymans.

843
01:22:50,872 --> 01:22:52,607
There's ten million
dollars in it.

844
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,643
You take care
of your daughter.

845
01:23:03,518 --> 01:23:04,719
I need your help.

846
01:23:09,423 --> 01:23:10,625
You need my help?

847
01:23:11,926 --> 01:23:14,127
There's an international
group of assassins

848
01:23:14,762 --> 01:23:18,131
that's ubiquitous and powerful.

849
01:23:19,968 --> 01:23:21,769
They can destroy the world.

850
01:23:22,704 --> 01:23:24,471
Creation of a new world order.

851
01:23:25,507 --> 01:23:27,542
That's why I killed
all these guys.

852
01:23:31,078 --> 01:23:32,747
And what I want is a partner.

853
01:23:34,014 --> 01:23:35,617
Help me bring 'em down,

854
01:23:37,017 --> 01:23:38,520
someone better than me.

855
01:23:40,522 --> 01:23:41,523
You.

856
01:23:43,156 --> 01:23:46,493
What I want is to be
with my daughter.

857
01:23:54,802 --> 01:23:57,805
There's a helicopter
that will take you
to the airport.

858
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:10,083
I'll be in touch.

859
01:24:37,946 --> 01:24:39,747
Isn't pizza the best?

860
01:24:39,781 --> 01:24:42,349
I know. It's really good.

861
01:24:42,951 --> 01:24:44,484
Can I have another milkshake?

862
01:24:45,853 --> 01:24:47,055
- You know what?
- What?

863
01:24:47,087 --> 01:24:48,188
I have an idea.

864
01:24:48,221 --> 01:24:50,123
- What is it?
- How about we split one?

865
01:24:50,157 --> 01:24:52,961
- That's a great idea.
- Right?

866
01:24:52,994 --> 01:24:54,696
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

867
01:25:25,793 --> 01:25:27,294
Hey, kiddo.

868
01:25:27,327 --> 01:25:28,295
Yeah?

869
01:25:28,328 --> 01:25:30,197
Why don't you go play
your video games?

870
01:25:30,230 --> 01:25:32,967
- Okay.
- Daddy's got to talk
to someone.

871
01:25:33,001 --> 01:25:34,334
Okay, Dad.

872
01:25:43,878 --> 01:25:46,881
- <i>Marcus?</i>
<i>- Eight p.m.</i>
<i>at the Coal Train.</i>

873
01:25:47,749 --> 01:25:49,416
<i>I loved her like a sister.</i>

874
01:26:06,567 --> 01:26:08,435
I told you you'd see me again.

875
01:26:11,204 --> 01:26:13,306
- This can't--
- It is.

876
01:26:14,008 --> 01:26:16,376
Sorry you had to see that.
But it is real.

877
01:26:18,478 --> 01:26:19,647
Your best friend and mentor,

878
01:26:19,681 --> 01:26:21,314
that's how diabolical
these people are.

879
01:26:29,157 --> 01:26:31,526
- Where'd you get this?
- I have my sources.

880
01:26:33,061 --> 01:26:34,662
They cloned your phone.

881
01:26:34,696 --> 01:26:36,263
Sent your wife a text.

882
01:26:37,431 --> 01:26:39,600
That's what made her go
to the club that night.

883
01:26:44,706 --> 01:26:47,608
These people who recruited
your friend,

884
01:26:48,843 --> 01:26:51,278
they're the ones I told you
about six months ago.

885
01:26:52,412 --> 01:26:54,515
They call themselves
"Scimitar."

886
01:27:00,121 --> 01:27:01,388
Are you ready?

887
01:27:06,493 --> 01:27:08,596
I have to make
some arrangements first.

888
01:27:12,265 --> 01:27:13,501
Then we go.

889
01:27:19,207 --> 01:27:21,408
Oh, and one more thing...
