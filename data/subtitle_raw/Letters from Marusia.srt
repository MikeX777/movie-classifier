1
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:21,829
What's wrong, Gregorio?

2
00:00:23,973 --> 00:00:25,804
Who are you, Gregorio?

3
00:00:26,176 --> 00:00:30,510
I don't know. There's a dark hand
pulling me from the chest...

4
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,883
...from the conscience, from
the blood...

5
00:00:33,883 --> 00:00:36,647
...as if they were strings, bonds.

6
00:00:36,986 --> 00:00:40,423
I feel like I have to do
something but I don't know...

7
00:00:40,423 --> 00:00:44,928
...what or how. So, I see my
life like a confused knot...

8
00:00:44,928 --> 00:00:46,953
...and close my eyes...

9
00:00:47,497 --> 00:00:50,955
...to guess which way
I'll follow.

10
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:27,559
The Mister is drunk again.

11
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,172
Is he dead?

12
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,714
Is he dead?

13
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,981
He is dead.

14
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:43,310
He is dead.

15
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,378
He is dead.

16
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:47,513
He is dead.

17
00:01:47,757 --> 00:01:50,089
He is dead.

18
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:40,002
Proceed, corporal.

19
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:48,215
Hey corporal.
- Uhm!

20
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:50,353
The Mister seems
like he was killed.

21
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:54,757
Seems so.
We have to look for footprints.

22
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,961
Don't be stupid, corporal!
Marusia's streets are...

23
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:59,895
...all footprints.

24
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:40,560
Sergeant, all killers
leave footprints.

25
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,738
Yes, but this killer will be named by the
administration.

26
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:45,738
We just execute them.

27
00:04:06,562 --> 00:04:10,862
The engineer was killed by
those who organize the strike.

28
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:14,526
The criminal walks
freely around here.

29
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,431
What are you waiting for?
Go and look for him.

30
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:47,948
I've only seen
the engineer in the land...

31
00:06:48,624 --> 00:06:51,559
...when he hit us
with his whip.

32
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:54,661
I haven't seen the engineer.

33
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:59,860
You hold a grudge against
the engineer, dirty Indian.

34
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:03,403
You hold a grudge because of
what happened the other day.

35
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,339
Everybody down from the cars!

36
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,639
You are the responsible,
fucking cholo!

37
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:13,842
And you!

38
00:07:24,393 --> 00:07:27,191
That time, I could have killed him.

39
00:07:28,331 --> 00:07:30,629
No, no, no, I didn't kill
the engineer.

40
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,735
Here are my hands, clean!

41
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:34,237
Shoot him!

42
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:36,239
Excuse me, I have to
take him to Iquique to...

43
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:37,968
...be judged, it is
established by the Law.

44
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:41,103
This scoundrel is outside
the Law.

45
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:07,723
<i>According to Article 12 of the
code of penal proceedings...</i>

46
00:10:07,723 --> 00:10:10,826
<i>... the Escape Law is applied
to Rufino Gomez Peralta,...</i>

47
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:14,421
<i>... Peruvian citizen.</i>

48
00:10:15,965 --> 00:10:21,270
Chile, fertile province
located in the famous...

49
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,907
...Antarctic region...

50
00:10:24,907 --> 00:10:28,311
...respected by ancient nations...

51
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:31,508
...for its strength, principal and
power.

52
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:37,453
Chile, fertile province
located in the famous...

53
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:41,457
...Antarctic region...

54
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:45,061
...respected by ancient nations...

55
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,553
...for its strength, principal and
power.

56
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,937
Rufino was my friend.

57
00:11:08,384 --> 00:11:10,648
My brother.

58
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:13,715
Damn it!

59
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:19,854
- Good night.
- Good night.

60
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:21,824
It's cold.

61
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:28,728
Give me a glass of wine.

62
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,679
Where are you going, buddy?
Let him be.

63
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,442
This is none of your business.

64
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:08,694
Sebastian.

65
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:13,332
You can't come in.

66
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:19,974
Little brother, they are
going to kill me.

67
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,611
They are going to kill me.

68
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:37,090
I have a lot of things to do.

69
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:40,132
You speak as a
damn traitor!

70
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:48,439
What worng with all of you?
Nobody wants to open the door.

71
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,846
I know.

72
00:13:50,846 --> 00:13:53,110
They'll shoot anyone
they find with you.

73
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:07,525
Hide me.
Just for tomorrow!

74
00:14:08,397 --> 00:14:10,729
Then I'll jump the walls
and I'll go away.

75
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,170
No, I can't.

76
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,901
I'll go down to Iquique.

77
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:22,511
Iquique is two hundred
kilometers away, you can't...

78
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:23,245
...go walking.

79
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:24,906
Fuck! Iquique, little brother.

80
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:27,572
No, you can't walk there.
It isn't true!

81
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:31,420
Well, I'll go somewhere
else, as a doomed.

82
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,489
You will leave your
prints everywhere.

83
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:36,253
All the Pampa is full of
cops looking for you.

84
00:14:36,392 --> 00:14:38,792
I will go up the range,
I'll hide in the villages.

85
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:42,660
Listen, Sebastian.
¡Listen carefully!

86
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:47,269
You'll see your signs on
all the walls. All the Pampa...

87
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:49,134
...is full of cops
closing you in.

88
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:51,697
So, what do I do,
little brother?

89
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:55,044
Take a dynamite charge
and blow up the barracks...

90
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:56,841
...you can help us with that.

91
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,681
Help you with what?

92
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,715
I can't tell you.

93
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:08,822
And now...

94
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:10,926
...please.

95
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:12,052
Get out of my home.

96
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:22,835
Sebastian!

97
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:24,429
Sebastian!

98
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,371
Don't speak when
they are about to shoot you!

99
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:36,247
That way they won't
notice your fear.

100
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:48,962
Like I told you last night,
it could only have been him!

101
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:51,567
Like I told you last night,
it could only have been him!

102
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:52,935
It could only have been him!

103
00:15:52,935 --> 00:15:56,005
Like I told you last night,
it could only have been him!

104
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:59,041
Like I told you last night,
it could only have been him!

105
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,544
It could only have been him!
Like I told you last night!

106
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,172
it could only have been him!
Like I told you last night!

107
00:16:06,248 --> 00:16:08,984
Like I told you last night,
it could only have been him!

108
00:16:08,984 --> 00:16:12,010
It could only have been him!
Like I told you last night!

109
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:21,664
Tell people to
gather dynamite.

110
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:22,756
I came to talk
about Sebastian.

111
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,900
Tell people to gather
dynamite, two cartridges...

112
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,027
...each man and bury it
in the east wall.

113
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:28,194
But they are going
to kill Sebastian.

114
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:30,506
Sebastian made a mistake,
now there will be a massacre...

115
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:31,206
...in the entire north.

116
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:33,003
Tell people to
gather dynamite.

117
00:16:33,308 --> 00:16:36,334
I knew you were crazy,
since I first saw you, I knew it.

118
00:16:53,395 --> 00:16:56,762
Hey, why have you turned
a butcher?

119
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:03,000
You cover my eyes because you
don't want me to look at you.

120
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,306
Don't you see?
Your conscience shivers.

121
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:09,945
You, do it!

122
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,548
I don't know how!
I've never shot anyone before!

123
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:15,176
Doesn't matter,
at one point youll have to!

124
00:17:15,384 --> 00:17:19,912
Sergeant, do me a
favor, tell my woman...

125
00:17:19,988 --> 00:17:22,752
...that she don't cry,
death isn't...

126
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:03,792
<i>Even if we go on strike
or not, in two days...</i>

127
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:05,861
<i>... we will have the
army troops here.</i>

128
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:08,557
<i>A strike won't
stop the army...</i>

129
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,866
<i>... to shoot us.</i>

130
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:14,131
<i>To stop the machine guns
and gun carriages...</i>

131
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:16,433
<i>... we have to blow up the
train when...</i>

132
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:17,904
<i>... it starts its ascent
from Iquique.</i>

133
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,871
<i>We have to tell the
privates to...</i>

134
00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:21,842
<i>... not shoot against us.</i>

135
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:23,571
<i>We have to send messages.</i>

136
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:30,052
A big strike.
A strike that will paralyze...

137
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:32,054
...the entire north.

138
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:33,544
All the Pampa.

139
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:36,916
We have to focus on that.

140
00:19:42,397 --> 00:19:44,456
<i>We have to coordinate us.</i>

141
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:46,933
<i>We have to be a unity.</i>

142
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:50,202
A strike.

143
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:52,062
A big strike.

144
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:54,500
This is the legal weapon of the worker.

145
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,105
<i>A strike will be crushed
in a couple of hours.</i>

146
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:03,943
<i>We have to think in alternatives.</i>

147
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:09,455
This strike is a warning,
little fellows.

148
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:12,657
Nobody must go to work today.

149
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:13,922
Neither tomorrow.

150
00:20:16,331 --> 00:20:18,567
The company has escalated
the repressions to...

151
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:20,762
...stop the uprising.

152
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:25,369
We won't be swept away
by provocations.

153
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,798
You have good intentions
fellow.

154
00:20:30,412 --> 00:20:32,073
Why do you say that?

155
00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:36,977
<i>We know that this not
just about the strike.</i>

156
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,253
<i>The strike is just one
of the steps.</i>

157
00:20:41,456 --> 00:20:44,289
<i>For each strike won, ten are lost.</i>

158
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,221
<i>So think, it is
the time to consider...</i>

159
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:49,526
<i>... more complex
ways of fighting.</i>

160
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:52,457
<i>Although...</i>

161
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:56,337
<i>... Im Gregorio too,
fragmented.</i>

162
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:58,396
<i>Sometimes I seperate myself...</i>

163
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,403
<i>... I loose myself...</i>

164
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:02,067
<i>... and I tell myself...</i>

165
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:04,442
<i>... it will come, Gregorio...</i>

166
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,815
<i>... You look at yourself...</i>

167
00:21:06,815 --> 00:21:08,483
<i>... limb to limb...</i>

168
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:12,886
<i>... and the will emerges,
the decision.</i>

169
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,248
Are they on strike?

170
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:24,917
I think so.

171
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:27,195
Speak with the labour union.

172
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,361
If they insist in paralyzing
the work,...

173
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,560
... telegraph to Iquique.

174
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:39,341
You know, if the strike
breaks out, it will spread...

175
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:42,708
...like an epidemia,
paralyzing the entire north.

176
00:22:48,817 --> 00:22:50,876
Tomorrow the soldiers
will come.

177
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,079
Tomorrow the soldiers
will come.

178
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:55,624
Tomorrow the soldiers
will come.

179
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,159
Tomorrow the soldiers
will come.

180
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:58,960
Tomorrow the soldiers
will come.

181
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,484
Tomorrow the soldiers
will come.

182
00:23:00,562 --> 00:23:02,359
Tomorrow the soldiers
will come.

183
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:05,901
Tomorrow the soldiers
will come.

184
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:08,802
Tomorrow the soldiers
will come.

185
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,302
What do we have to do?

186
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:16,178
What do we have to do?

187
00:23:16,178 --> 00:23:17,543
What do we have to do?

188
00:23:17,612 --> 00:23:18,544
What do we have to do?

189
00:23:18,613 --> 00:23:20,240
What do we have to do?

190
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,714
What do we have to do?

191
00:23:21,783 --> 00:23:23,218
What do we have to do?

192
00:23:23,218 --> 00:23:24,446
What do we have to do?

193
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:26,414
They will kill us
like dogs.

194
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:29,357
They will kill us
like dogs.

195
00:23:29,357 --> 00:23:31,086
They will kill us
like dogs.

196
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:33,829
They will kill us
like dogs.

197
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,194
They will kill us
like dogs.

198
00:23:35,397 --> 00:23:36,523
Again.

199
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:37,392
Again.

200
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:38,658
Again.

201
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:39,859
Again.

202
00:23:40,702 --> 00:23:43,136
Yes, again.

203
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:44,599
What do we have to do?

204
00:23:44,806 --> 00:23:46,137
What do we have to do?

205
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:48,503
What do we have to do?

206
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,439
What do we have to do?

207
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:51,807
What do we have to do?

208
00:23:51,913 --> 00:23:54,082
This night you should come,
one by one to the theatre...

209
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:55,606
...use the back door.

210
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:58,109
Those who can't come...

211
00:23:58,286 --> 00:23:59,617
...must collect water...

212
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:01,350
...collect food...

213
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:03,756
...and matches.

214
00:24:04,993 --> 00:24:06,426
Why matches?

215
00:24:07,729 --> 00:24:09,321
To light the dynamite.

216
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:11,188
To light the dynamite.

217
00:24:11,967 --> 00:24:13,457
To light the dynamite.

218
00:24:13,802 --> 00:24:14,860
To light the dynamite.

219
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:16,402
To light the dynamite.

220
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:18,667
To light the dynamite.

221
00:24:18,807 --> 00:24:20,365
To light the dynamite.

222
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:21,976
To light the dynamite.

223
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:24,773
To light the dynamite.

224
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,781
Well, fellows.

225
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,583
As a result of
the election...

226
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,626
... duties
have been confirmed for...

227
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:22,397
...our fellows...

228
00:26:22,397 --> 00:26:24,266
...Domingo Soto...

229
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:26,496
...Cristo Licantem...

230
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:30,868
...and our fellow Gregorio
have been elected, here present.

231
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:41,811
Fellows, with this
information...

232
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:47,122
...the new board will summon...

233
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:50,785
...to inform what have
been placed...

234
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:54,859
...in the new steps of
our movement.

235
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,578
Please, fellow.

236
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:56,689
No, thanks.

237
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,795
You are so quiet,
little fellow.

238
00:28:04,232 --> 00:28:07,395
More than ten days of travelling,
and not a word from you.

239
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:11,435
You just read and read.

240
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,568
That's good, isn't it?

241
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:20,241
<i>There goes Calles San Diego...</i>

242
00:28:20,315 --> 00:28:23,113
<i>... Calles San Diego there it goes...</i>

243
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,682
<i>... with its little whore.</i>

244
00:28:28,757 --> 00:28:30,592
Do you know what the
first thing is I'm going to do...

245
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,492
...when we arrive at port?

246
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:36,459
First, I'm going to find
me a little woman.

247
00:28:36,598 --> 00:28:41,467
Clean, and love her like
God wants.

248
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,140
And when I have some money,

249
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,442
I'll buy me a good hat.

250
00:28:47,442 --> 00:28:51,378
And a girdle and
pink panties for her.

251
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:57,112
<i>There goes Calles San Diego...</i>

252
00:28:57,218 --> 00:29:00,187
<i>... Calles San Diego there it goes...</i>

253
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:04,054
<i>... with its little girls.</i>

254
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:10,497
My name is Cristulo and
I'm from Mendoza.

255
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:13,629
And I'm your friend,
if you want.

256
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:16,334
My name is Gregorio
and I came from...

257
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:18,732
...from Santiago.

258
00:29:38,726 --> 00:29:40,250
Fellow.

259
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:50,403
Four of our fellows went
to La Coruña, Pontevedra.

260
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,302
Others went to Iquique
and Tocopilla.

261
00:29:56,478 --> 00:29:58,605
News from Soto?

262
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:02,843
Soto disappeared, they
know nothing at his home.

263
00:30:32,814 --> 00:30:34,076
Raise your head!

264
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,209
Back straight!

265
00:30:37,185 --> 00:30:39,119
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

266
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:43,553
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

267
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:46,422
And you, don't you want to learn?

268
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:50,729
Lets go.

269
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:52,797
Don't be shy.

270
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:01,538
No, no, my friend,
that is disastrous.

271
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,806
Attention! Look at me.

272
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:08,915
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

273
00:31:09,017 --> 00:31:10,484
One, two, three.

274
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:12,342
Very good!

275
00:31:13,254 --> 00:31:15,381
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

276
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:16,521
That's right!

277
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:18,053
Raise your head!

278
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,286
Back straight!

279
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,988
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

280
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,223
Very good!
One, two, three.

281
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,258
Fellow...

282
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:30,603
...we have a meeting this
night with Ricabarrio.

283
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:37,173
So, Gregorio,
do we count with you?

284
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:39,113
- Yes, sure.
- We have to go out of here...

285
00:31:39,113 --> 00:31:40,842
...immediately.

286
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:41,845
Immediately?

287
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:44,713
We have at least a
two hour trip.

288
00:31:47,288 --> 00:31:48,755
Well, lets go.

289
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:52,894
Lets go then, fellow,
Abarca is waiting...

290
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:54,418
...for us outside with
the others.

291
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:12,872
Four fellows went
to La Coruña, Pontevedra.

292
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:16,049
Others to Iquique,
Tocopillo.

293
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,178
If they get there, Gregorio,...

294
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:21,356
...they'll warn thousands of workers
and it will be the start...

295
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,756
...of a general insurrection.

296
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:28,086
The socialism is
a defined doctrine...

297
00:32:28,162 --> 00:32:29,959
...of precise structure.

298
00:32:30,064 --> 00:32:31,165
- How are you?
- Good evening.

299
00:32:31,165 --> 00:32:31,399
I'm going to present
you to a fellow.

300
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:32,866
I'm going to present
you to a fellow.

301
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:33,764
Gregorio.

302
00:32:34,902 --> 00:32:36,301
- Good evening.
- Nice to meet you.

303
00:32:36,604 --> 00:32:37,866
Excuse me.

304
00:32:38,006 --> 00:32:39,166
This way.

305
00:32:39,273 --> 00:32:42,572
The essential base of socialism,
consists in the abolition...

306
00:32:42,677 --> 00:32:44,508
I'm going to present
you to a fellow.

307
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:48,115
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

308
00:32:48,516 --> 00:32:51,974
...of what is now called
private property.

309
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,958
Replacing it with...

310
00:32:56,958 --> 00:33:00,086
... the collective or
common property.

311
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,795
Private property
is understood as...

312
00:33:02,864 --> 00:33:05,856
...the possession...

313
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:08,265
...and individual use of
the land and its produce...

314
00:33:09,103 --> 00:33:11,139
...of the tools...

315
00:33:11,139 --> 00:33:14,336
...machines and
production methods.

316
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:18,035
Socialism wants
the freedom of men...

317
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,712
...and the creation
of a workers' society.

318
00:33:23,117 --> 00:33:26,211
I need twenty men
for Pedro de Valdivia!

319
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:29,850
I offer more!

320
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,393
I offer more!

321
00:33:32,393 --> 00:33:35,596
I need fifteen men
for Marusia!

322
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,223
You can go!

323
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,958
You can't!

324
00:33:41,035 --> 00:33:43,833
I need strong men!
You can go!

325
00:33:43,905 --> 00:33:45,640
I'm paying five
gold pesos!

326
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,766
What did you say?

327
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:50,366
- If he doesn't come, I won't either.
- OK, Ill take both of you.

328
00:33:50,712 --> 00:33:54,273
OK, those for Marusia!
This way, this way!

329
00:34:25,947 --> 00:34:28,616
There are times, like this one,
in which...

330
00:34:28,616 --> 00:34:31,881
...order and the discipline
are imposed, not asked for.

331
00:34:32,253 --> 00:34:34,881
To fly the flag for ones country,
means to destroy our enemies.

332
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:39,293
It isnt convenient to
kill them all, after all...

333
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:41,056
...they are the
ones who work.

334
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:44,163
That's why you'll never
become a cardinal.

335
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,835
Quickly, to the administration!
To the administration!

336
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,545
Quickly, everybody out!

337
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:07,207
Everybody out!
Turn left!

338
00:36:08,216 --> 00:36:10,810
Everyone, I said!
Quickly!

339
00:36:11,052 --> 00:36:13,077
Everybody out, damn it!

340
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:16,880
Lets go!
Turn left!

341
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:42,466
How many shoots
did you fire, Lieutenant?

342
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,940
You saw my gun.

343
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:52,684
There were three used cartridges.

344
00:37:53,054 --> 00:37:54,885
Do you know why
I tell you this?

345
00:37:55,723 --> 00:37:57,953
The report accuses
you, Lieutenant.

346
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:01,629
You shot three shots
and private Macias had...

347
00:38:01,629 --> 00:38:03,494
...three bullets in his body.

348
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:07,430
When the shooting started,
everyone ran away...

349
00:38:07,501 --> 00:38:09,696
And as you didn't explain us,...

350
00:38:10,004 --> 00:38:12,734
...our people entered
shooting like crazy.

351
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,102
So...

352
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:18,805
...two mistakes and
six more deaths.

353
00:38:20,915 --> 00:38:23,042
Will I lose my job?

354
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,352
Your job and something else,
I guess.

355
00:38:27,254 --> 00:38:29,552
So, report by report.

356
00:38:31,826 --> 00:38:34,317
I'll write your next
report myself...

357
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:37,932
...so neither of us
will have a problem in...

358
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:39,627
...this damn report.

359
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:42,996
As your order, lieutenant.

360
00:38:57,885 --> 00:39:01,355
The men who try to
abandon the camp...

361
00:39:01,355 --> 00:39:05,883
...will be considered as
deserters and will be...

362
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,758
...executed in on spot!

363
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:14,194
Your women and children
will be severely punished!

364
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:17,794
There won't be work
turns at night!

365
00:39:18,472 --> 00:39:21,409
Everybody must stay in
their homes...

366
00:39:21,409 --> 00:39:25,277
...from 8 oclock
until 6 in the morning!

367
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:29,105
Anyone evading
this disposition...

368
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,683
...will be executed
immediatly!

369
00:39:32,987 --> 00:39:36,724
This situation will be
indefinitely until...

370
00:39:36,724 --> 00:39:40,421
...the responsible of these
criminal acts...

371
00:39:40,594 --> 00:39:44,928
...are put before
a military court!

372
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,169
The command is aware...

373
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:50,501
...that just a small
group of individuals...

374
00:39:50,938 --> 00:39:54,032
...is responsible of
these vile acts.

375
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:56,367
That's why...

376
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:59,447
...we appeal to
the workers of Marusia's...

377
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:01,540
...to reveal...

378
00:40:01,615 --> 00:40:04,049
...the name of the guilty.

379
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,676
Otherwise...

380
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:10,084
...this command will from
this moment...

381
00:40:10,224 --> 00:40:12,556
...call for the severest measures...

382
00:40:12,626 --> 00:40:15,096
...directed to clarify...

383
00:40:15,096 --> 00:40:17,530
...these bloody events!

384
00:40:19,066 --> 00:40:20,533
Take those down!

385
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:22,669
Go!

386
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,332
Go, quickly!

387
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:29,603
Move!

388
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:32,606
Take them down!
Go!

389
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:38,114
Ready!

390
00:40:38,586 --> 00:40:40,417
Aim!

391
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:41,451
Fire!

392
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:58,029
When the priest tolls
the bells...

393
00:41:01,075 --> 00:41:02,975
Quickly!
Down there!

394
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:04,877
There, take them down!

395
00:41:05,846 --> 00:41:07,643
Take down that
son of a bitch!

396
00:42:08,742 --> 00:42:10,107
Attention!

397
00:42:10,477 --> 00:42:11,739
Ready!

398
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,411
Aim!

399
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:20,953
You have one minute to talk!

400
00:42:47,948 --> 00:42:48,676
Fire!

401
00:42:50,618 --> 00:42:52,984
Rest!

402
00:42:53,754 --> 00:42:56,484
They are tough, hard to die.

403
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,757
Shit!

404
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,263
These are the ones who
want to kill you.

405
00:44:20,341 --> 00:44:22,376
No compassion
for them, god damn it!

406
00:44:22,376 --> 00:44:24,310
Us or them!

407
00:44:30,851 --> 00:44:32,478
Speak, you shit, speak!

408
00:44:33,153 --> 00:44:35,747
Speak, you shit, speak!

409
00:44:41,795 --> 00:44:46,323
Speak, if you don't want
me to kill you here.

410
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:52,438
Who are they?

411
00:44:53,307 --> 00:44:54,569
Speak.

412
00:44:55,309 --> 00:44:57,368
Where do they hide?

413
00:44:58,178 --> 00:45:02,444
Speak for your own good,
Domingo Soto, speak.

414
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,486
We know that you
aren't in favour of...

415
00:45:05,486 --> 00:45:07,215
...those methods.

416
00:45:08,088 --> 00:45:10,682
Speak, Domingo Soto.

417
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:17,024
...speak, shit!

418
00:45:18,399 --> 00:45:19,933
<i>Why matches?</i>

419
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:21,491
<i>To light the dynamite.</i>

420
00:45:21,602 --> 00:45:22,899
<i>To light the dynamite.</i>

421
00:45:23,003 --> 00:45:25,062
<i>To light the dynamite.</i>

422
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:04,070
Ready!

423
00:46:14,988 --> 00:46:16,751
Aim!

424
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,567
Fire!

425
00:47:04,271 --> 00:47:07,206
Medio Juan, Medio Juan,
the soldiers are looking for you!

426
00:47:16,617 --> 00:47:20,553
You have to leave
right away with the kids.

427
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:27,661
- Fellow, little fellow.
- Yes, Medio Juan.

428
00:47:27,661 --> 00:47:29,263
You must leave the house
before the soldiers come...

429
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,731
...warn the neighbours.

430
00:47:35,903 --> 00:47:37,063
Hey German.

431
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,907
<i>For you, cholito.</i>

432
00:48:36,697 --> 00:48:38,289
Who is it?

433
00:48:41,802 --> 00:48:43,633
Get out with your hands up!

434
00:48:43,804 --> 00:48:45,362
Come, in.

435
00:48:45,439 --> 00:48:47,873
<i>Don't you see?
I'm drinking my vermouth.</i>

436
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,566
Stand up!

437
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:51,268
What's the matter?

438
00:48:51,545 --> 00:48:54,412
I just returned from the job.
I'm eating.

439
00:48:55,215 --> 00:48:57,080
What the hell is going on?

440
00:49:31,685 --> 00:49:34,347
He killed eight, Gregorio.

441
00:49:35,322 --> 00:49:36,550
He killed eight.

442
00:49:38,525 --> 00:49:40,618
All of this is useless.

443
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,560
We have to find another way.

444
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:12,222
- Come and look for us!
- Come on, you fag soldier!

445
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:13,389
Shoot me!

446
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,758
Come if you dare!

447
00:50:45,092 --> 00:50:47,219
The soldiers refuse to obey!

448
00:50:47,861 --> 00:50:50,659
We have to telegraph urgently to
Iquique, asking for a regiment!

449
00:51:02,709 --> 00:51:05,075
Hey boy, do you like my waist?

450
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,209
Do you want to
dance some waltz?

451
00:51:11,518 --> 00:51:13,543
Come and see if
you want all of this!

452
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,417
Look!

453
00:51:15,922 --> 00:51:17,412
Just be careful...

454
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,254
...a regiment from
Iquique is coming.

455
00:51:26,299 --> 00:51:27,596
We have to stop this
lack of discipline.

456
00:51:28,368 --> 00:51:29,630
We have to start the dialogue.

457
00:51:30,637 --> 00:51:32,662
We have to reach an
agreement with the workers.

458
00:51:32,739 --> 00:51:35,401
That's unacceptable!
Dishonourable!

459
00:51:36,943 --> 00:51:39,173
I prefer being still alive.

460
00:51:42,749 --> 00:51:44,910
Sergeant Peñaloza!

461
00:51:45,118 --> 00:51:47,487
Catch five men at random
and execute them!

462
00:51:47,487 --> 00:51:50,047
- That's not possible, lieutenant!
- Do you want to jump with me?

463
00:51:51,825 --> 00:51:53,554
Coward old man!

464
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,362
Gainza, join the troops
in the barracks!

465
00:52:21,488 --> 00:52:23,922
Cavalry trotting!

466
00:52:24,157 --> 00:52:25,454
Calameño!

467
00:53:46,172 --> 00:53:50,472
Mr. Jones ask for a
meeting in one hour here.

468
00:53:53,346 --> 00:53:56,144
He wants to reach an
agreement with you.

469
00:53:58,251 --> 00:54:02,119
The company wants to reach
an agreement with you.

470
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:08,650
Now, Tinoco.

471
00:54:28,481 --> 00:54:31,143
Ready!

472
00:54:33,586 --> 00:54:36,180
Aim!

473
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:38,687
Fire!

474
00:54:43,129 --> 00:54:46,963
Is anyone else ready
to disobey the orders?

475
00:54:50,103 --> 00:54:51,627
Lieutenant Gainza!

476
00:54:52,305 --> 00:54:53,897
To the square!

477
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,789
It's a wish from the administration to
reach...

478
00:55:09,789 --> 00:55:13,156
...an agreement with the workers.

479
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:19,688
The administration wishes
to reach peace in Marusia.

480
00:55:23,336 --> 00:55:25,505
This reunion is fucking over!

481
00:55:25,505 --> 00:55:28,872
...Two minutes to dissolve.
- Lieutenant, I beg you...

482
00:55:28,942 --> 00:55:31,778
...let me proceed the
dialogue with the workers.

483
00:55:31,778 --> 00:55:34,280
I'm the authority!
Dissolve, god damn it!

484
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,248
Back, you bastards!

485
00:55:36,483 --> 00:55:38,849
Dissolve, shit!

486
00:55:39,152 --> 00:55:43,020
Dissolve you sons
of a bitches! Dissolve!

487
00:55:43,323 --> 00:55:46,019
- Back, you bastards!
- Murderer!

488
00:55:46,126 --> 00:55:49,095
- Dissolve!
- Son of a bitch!

489
00:55:57,303 --> 00:55:58,793
Retreat!

490
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:01,639
Calvary, retreat!

491
00:57:27,127 --> 00:57:28,754
Domingo Soto.

492
00:57:31,397 --> 00:57:33,365
Lets go, little fellow.

493
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,512
Where did you enter?

494
00:58:30,056 --> 00:58:32,547
Where we always do.

495
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,052
Are there soldiers there?

496
00:58:36,496 --> 00:58:39,522
We haven't seen
any soldiers.

497
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:20,572
- Look, compadre, supplies.
- Yes.

498
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:56,035
The soldiers are gone.

499
00:59:57,944 --> 00:59:59,912
You won't do business
with the employees.

500
01:00:01,547 --> 01:00:03,606
And we don't have money.

501
01:00:05,084 --> 01:00:06,346
Hey, Calameño.

502
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:11,119
Lets have a drink and
talk over there.

503
01:00:16,729 --> 01:00:19,129
OK, as you say.

504
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,963
Go, there.

505
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:47,458
The roads to the south are clear.

506
01:00:48,528 --> 01:00:51,827
It hasn't been raining
for a long time.

507
01:00:52,999 --> 01:00:56,602
Its still snowing heavy
in the ranges,

508
01:00:56,602 --> 01:01:02,063
<i>...covering the passes.</i>

509
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:11,409
Its the truth,
we dont have money.

510
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,452
And tomorrow...

511
01:01:15,855 --> 01:01:18,187
...the regiment of
Iquique will arrive.

512
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:26,491
Do you understand?

513
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:31,097
We will have to sell
in another office.

514
01:01:31,637 --> 01:01:35,334
What a shame,
the long trip wasted.

515
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:37,977
If you go back, you will
meet up with the soldiers...

516
01:01:37,977 --> 01:01:39,672
...and they will take
your merchandise.

517
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,446
We have to sell them
in another office.

518
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:46,585
We need that money.

519
01:01:46,819 --> 01:01:49,310
The supplies stay here!

520
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,852
Unload quickly!

521
01:02:00,266 --> 01:02:02,769
It should be stored
in different houses!

522
01:02:02,769 --> 01:02:05,033
Little portions
in different houses!

523
01:02:05,104 --> 01:02:07,436
You must look
after the water!

524
01:02:18,418 --> 01:02:21,354
That morning in La Coruña,
general Shultz said...

525
01:02:21,354 --> 01:02:23,788
..."I don't want any survivors".

526
01:02:49,081 --> 01:02:51,811
First we had fear, but...

527
01:02:52,919 --> 01:02:54,978
...everything happened
like a lighting.

528
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:58,657
Thousands of bastards fell that day.

529
01:02:59,425 --> 01:03:01,552
It was like a pigeons hunt.

530
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:06,488
Then we went over them
with the bayonets.

531
01:03:08,601 --> 01:03:10,303
First...

532
01:03:10,303 --> 01:03:13,033
...you feel like a tickling
in all the body, but...

533
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:17,543
...once you calm down,
the smell of blood...

534
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:20,842
...makes you feel desire to
kill and keep killing.

535
01:03:28,187 --> 01:03:30,655
General Brown...

536
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:33,481
...a brave general.

537
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:36,058
And Major Schiller.

538
01:03:36,496 --> 01:03:39,021
Troncoso, do you remember
Captain Haisen, he chased...

539
01:03:39,098 --> 01:03:41,767
...us on his horse?
As if we were cows.

540
01:03:41,767 --> 01:03:43,826
Fuck.

541
01:03:49,876 --> 01:03:51,711
Have you thought why...

542
01:03:51,711 --> 01:03:54,077
...all our instructors...

543
01:03:54,614 --> 01:03:57,674
...all our bosses have
American names, Troncoso?

544
01:03:58,317 --> 01:04:00,148
It's like an invasion...

545
01:04:00,686 --> 01:04:02,522
...slow and quiet.

546
01:04:02,522 --> 01:04:04,251
Don't say bullshit.

547
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:09,918
You are a good pupil,
Troncoso. The best of all.

548
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:13,424
Why did they send you
to the north, Troncosito?

549
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:15,825
Why?

550
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:44,090
- Who are they?
- The "sulphates".

551
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:47,228
- Sulphates?
- Yes, man.

552
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,961
Workers of the
sulphate mines.

553
01:04:50,169 --> 01:04:52,104
Because of their living
conditions they go mad...

554
01:04:52,104 --> 01:04:54,766
...in two or three years.

555
01:04:55,341 --> 01:04:57,743
They start to drift
around the settlements...

556
01:04:57,743 --> 01:05:00,803
...trying to get inside,...

557
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,438
...they're sent away, naturally.

558
01:05:02,615 --> 01:05:05,550
They are human remains, Troncoso.

559
01:05:13,926 --> 01:05:16,417
Why did they send you
to the north, my captain?

560
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,496
What mistake did
you do, captain?

561
01:05:52,164 --> 01:05:55,031
Fellows, I think we
can sum up.

562
01:05:56,268 --> 01:05:58,236
So, we said...

563
01:05:59,438 --> 01:06:00,871
..the train is going to
arrive at noon.

564
01:06:01,507 --> 01:06:04,410
- There are forty kilometers.
- Forty kilometers.

565
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:05,001
- There are forty kilometers.
- Forty kilometers.

566
01:06:05,244 --> 01:06:07,144
We had already said that...

567
01:06:07,246 --> 01:06:09,015
...to make them jump
we need...

568
01:06:09,015 --> 01:06:11,711
...sixty kilos of dynamite.
- We have enough.

569
01:06:11,784 --> 01:06:13,919
We need twelve man
to carry it.

570
01:06:13,919 --> 01:06:16,155
We have to evade
Gainza's guard.

571
01:06:16,155 --> 01:06:18,089
No, no, no, that will cause
problems. It's not possible...

572
01:06:19,158 --> 01:06:20,420
It's not possible.

573
01:06:20,793 --> 01:06:23,023
I ask for the word,
fellows!

574
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:31,001
Who is there?

575
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:32,903
Is it you, Juan?

576
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,263
What do you want?

577
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:36,238
Don't be scared, kid.

578
01:06:36,709 --> 01:06:38,301
Back, back,
or I'll shoot.

579
01:06:38,511 --> 01:06:40,103
Let us pass, I'm telling you.

580
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,648
I just obey orders, madam.

581
01:06:43,215 --> 01:06:45,084
I have to shoot.

582
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:47,119
Don't you see that we have
to go for water?

583
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:49,053
Don't you see
weve run out of water?

584
01:06:49,155 --> 01:06:51,020
You can't shoot us
soldier...

585
01:06:51,157 --> 01:06:52,958
...don't you see that
we have to go for water?

586
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:53,185
...don't you see that
we have to go for water?

587
01:06:53,259 --> 01:06:56,786
You are also a person
like us, mr. Soldier.

588
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:01,959
Who is there?

589
01:07:03,302 --> 01:07:05,237
Conscripto Rosales,
on guard, sergeant.

590
01:07:05,237 --> 01:07:07,967
- Answer when you're asked!
- Yes, sergeant.

591
01:07:12,311 --> 01:07:14,280
Now you have to point us
to where to follow the...

592
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,373
...train line?
- I won't tell you that.

593
01:07:16,716 --> 01:07:17,483
We have to find the
path before the dawn.

594
01:07:17,483 --> 01:07:18,472
We have to find the
path before the dawn.

595
01:07:19,085 --> 01:07:21,610
Now tell us the way
to evade the patrol.

596
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:27,319
Come this way.
I will direct you.

597
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:32,324
Hurry up, hurry up.

598
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,828
Nicely done.

599
01:08:36,929 --> 01:08:39,932
What the hell is going on?
- Don't you see?

600
01:08:39,932 --> 01:08:41,957
Stand up, immediately!

601
01:08:42,868 --> 01:08:46,395
Stand up, I'm telling
you, fucking Indians!

602
01:08:49,241 --> 01:08:50,868
Oh, really?

603
01:08:51,911 --> 01:08:53,742
Won't you obey?

604
01:08:53,946 --> 01:08:54,580
Very good.
Very good!

605
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,912
Very good.
Very good!

606
01:08:57,416 --> 01:09:00,783
Engine driver, backwards and
right forward, full speed!

607
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:04,788
No, I won't do that,
captain.

608
01:09:05,157 --> 01:09:09,228
What is this?
Insubordination...

609
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:11,389
...Insubordination!

610
01:09:12,498 --> 01:09:14,864
Lieutenant Espinoza, take
the charge. Execute him!

611
01:09:16,702 --> 01:09:18,863
Execute him,
it's an order!

612
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,419
Back to the train.

613
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:34,647
Full speed!

614
01:09:35,788 --> 01:09:38,484
Now you fucked all up,
Troncoso.

615
01:09:38,958 --> 01:09:41,426
We don't have
another engine driver.

616
01:10:05,084 --> 01:10:06,016
Fire!

617
01:10:09,255 --> 01:10:10,449
Fire!

618
01:12:45,177 --> 01:12:46,804
Fellows.

619
01:12:46,912 --> 01:12:48,709
Little fellows.

620
01:12:48,847 --> 01:12:50,712
We all know that we are
passing...

621
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,618
...through a difficult situation.

622
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:56,019
But we have to stay together,
with order and discipline.

623
01:12:57,022 --> 01:12:58,323
All instructions will come
from this leadership.

624
01:12:58,323 --> 01:12:59,153
All instructions will come
from this leadership.

625
01:12:59,258 --> 01:13:01,192
We let the Englishmen and
employees go...

626
01:13:01,593 --> 01:13:03,729
...and we hand over
the dynamite.

627
01:13:03,729 --> 01:13:06,892
Only that way can a dialogue
begin says the captain.

628
01:13:13,172 --> 01:13:14,571
No, I disagree.

629
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,399
What is it you propose?

630
01:13:17,543 --> 01:13:19,101
If we let the workers
and Englishmen go...

631
01:13:19,178 --> 01:13:21,009
...we will be executed
immediately.

632
01:13:21,447 --> 01:13:22,347
If we give them the dynamite...

633
01:13:22,347 --> 01:13:23,746
If we give them the dynamite...

634
01:13:24,149 --> 01:13:26,549
...it won't take so long
before the massacre start.

635
01:13:28,387 --> 01:13:30,184
It has always been like that.

636
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:33,249
And what else we can do?

637
01:13:34,793 --> 01:13:36,192
Organize us...

638
01:13:36,895 --> 01:13:38,522
...prepare a defence plan.

639
01:13:40,732 --> 01:13:42,668
Until now, everything
has happened spontaneously...

640
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:44,533
...without a real control.

641
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:46,872
This is the moment to
establish a well-organized...

642
01:13:46,872 --> 01:13:47,739
This is the moment to
establish a well-organized...

643
01:13:47,739 --> 01:13:49,673
...way of fighting.

644
01:13:54,646 --> 01:13:56,415
We mustn't forget that...

645
01:13:56,415 --> 01:13:58,617
...at this time
two of our fellows...

646
01:13:58,617 --> 01:14:00,551
...have informed
other demarcations.

647
01:14:02,988 --> 01:14:05,320
If we are able to hold out...

648
01:14:06,458 --> 01:14:08,926
...and raise all the north.

649
01:14:09,828 --> 01:14:11,396
The army cannot control
all the Pampa.

650
01:14:11,396 --> 01:14:12,886
The army cannot control
all the Pampa.

651
01:14:14,133 --> 01:14:15,794
And once soldiers realize...

652
01:14:16,401 --> 01:14:18,961
...that we are an
organized force...

653
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:23,166
...they will begin to join us.

654
01:14:25,244 --> 01:14:27,813
From here, from Marusia...

655
01:14:27,813 --> 01:14:30,441
...we can start a new movement
with such a force...

656
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:33,910
...it will revolutionize
all the country.

657
01:14:34,686 --> 01:14:35,420
It will be a workers...

658
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:37,251
It will be a workers...

659
01:14:38,157 --> 01:14:42,457
...soldiers, students and
peasants movement.

660
01:14:49,601 --> 01:14:52,297
No, no, it's not possible...

661
01:14:53,472 --> 01:14:57,135
...to make that, we need a lot of
time and we havent.

662
01:14:57,709 --> 01:14:59,574
We are not prepared.

663
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,607
We have to dialogue, that's
our only way.

664
01:15:07,419 --> 01:15:10,081
That is the shortest way to
death, fellow.

665
01:15:23,001 --> 01:15:24,469
They can't bombard
Marusia...

666
01:15:24,469 --> 01:15:25,561
They can't bombard
Marusia...

667
01:15:26,171 --> 01:15:29,470
...if they destroy the facilities
they will lose everything.

668
01:15:30,008 --> 01:15:33,910
The company, won't allow it.

669
01:15:35,981 --> 01:15:37,471
Tarapaca...

670
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:40,175
...and Antofagasta.

671
01:15:40,586 --> 01:15:42,988
Provinces won by our
country in the war...

672
01:15:42,988 --> 01:15:44,615
...against Peru and Bolivia.

673
01:15:45,557 --> 01:15:48,493
The value of the natural
resources are incalculable.

674
01:15:48,794 --> 01:15:51,388
Its has a concentration
of manpower.

675
01:15:51,597 --> 01:15:54,199
Workers from all
over the world.

676
01:15:54,199 --> 01:15:58,533
Bolivian, Peruvian, Chilean
French and Italian workers.

677
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:01,930
Settlements are scattered
all over the Pampa.

678
01:16:03,742 --> 01:16:07,143
Number of workers: One hundred
thousand, including their families.

679
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,279
Amount of military forces;
ten thousand soldiers.

680
01:16:11,383 --> 01:16:13,018
It other words,
five camps scattered...

681
01:16:13,018 --> 01:16:14,453
It other words,
five camps scattered...

682
01:16:14,453 --> 01:16:16,021
...all over the zone.

683
01:16:16,021 --> 01:16:18,353
Which makes it difficult
to control the area.

684
01:16:18,557 --> 01:16:19,854
It would be enough with...

685
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:22,761
...a strong rebellion breaking out
in a small place like Marusia...

686
01:16:22,761 --> 01:16:25,163
...for it to extend to all
the other settlements and...

687
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:28,690
...it would be
impossible to suppress.

688
01:16:29,368 --> 01:16:30,669
This would mean...

689
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:33,705
...to risk the stability
of the Chilean government...

690
01:16:33,705 --> 01:16:35,741
...because the
separatist ideas...

691
01:16:35,741 --> 01:16:37,542
...are also present in
the south of the country.

692
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:37,837
...are also present in
the south of the country.

693
01:16:37,943 --> 01:16:40,036
So, if that were to happen...

694
01:16:40,112 --> 01:16:42,881
...we would be caught up
in an infernal circle...

695
01:16:42,881 --> 01:16:45,284
...north to south.

696
01:16:45,284 --> 01:16:46,546
So...

697
01:16:46,918 --> 01:16:48,720
...our plan
is to remove...

698
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:51,056
...thoroughly the problem
where it is located...

699
01:16:51,056 --> 01:16:52,853
...and in a definitive manner.

700
01:16:53,725 --> 01:16:57,217
This is a war gentlemen
and we have to act accordingly.

701
01:16:58,297 --> 01:17:00,866
If we need to destroy
Marusia to preserve...

702
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:01,566
...the stability of the country
and the continent...

703
01:17:01,566 --> 01:17:02,301
...the stability of the country
and the continent...

704
01:17:02,301 --> 01:17:04,792
...we will do that
without hesitation.

705
01:17:06,938 --> 01:17:08,963
Tell Mr. O'Brian...

706
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:11,310
...that my government
considers it better...

707
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:14,713
...for the company to loose
one office...

708
01:17:14,713 --> 01:17:17,477
...than to put in
jeopardy the minerals.

709
01:17:38,370 --> 01:17:40,872
Mister O'Brian says that
he has already spoken...

710
01:17:40,872 --> 01:17:42,341
...with the President and he agrees.

711
01:17:42,341 --> 01:17:44,809
The only thing he
recommends is prudence.

712
01:17:45,711 --> 01:17:48,413
Tell, Mr. O'Brian that
he's talking with an officer...

713
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:50,615
...of the Chilean army and
the Chilean army...

714
01:17:50,615 --> 01:17:50,949
...of the Chilean army and
the Chilean army...

715
01:17:50,949 --> 01:17:53,383
...doesn't need recommendations

716
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:07,933
It is necessary to take...

717
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:09,901
...the measures needed.

718
01:18:10,102 --> 01:18:11,903
All the Englishmen
must be evacuated...

719
01:18:11,903 --> 01:18:13,427
...from the settlement.

720
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:51,103
Quickly, quickly!

721
01:18:51,977 --> 01:18:54,207
This way, gentlemen!
Come on, quickly!

722
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:58,275
Hurry up, we don't have
much time, come on, quickly!

723
01:18:58,717 --> 01:18:59,885
Careful, don't push each other!

724
01:18:59,885 --> 01:19:01,318
Come on, in order, quick!

725
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,523
Hurry up, sirs, quick!

726
01:19:10,662 --> 01:19:11,924
Quickly, let's go!

727
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:13,398
Order please, order please!

728
01:19:13,398 --> 01:19:15,525
- Women first, help them!
- Come on!

729
01:20:53,865 --> 01:20:55,355
Good afternoon.

730
01:21:23,094 --> 01:21:26,120
I was in Iquique too,
when the mass killing occurred.

731
01:21:32,704 --> 01:21:35,400
<i>We couldn't believe it.</i>

732
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:38,767
<i>Thousands came to Iquique.</i>

733
01:21:39,244 --> 01:21:41,269
<i>They were waiting for
the quartermaster.</i>

734
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:47,050
<i>When he arrived, he went to
the balcony and promised justice.</i>

735
01:21:47,285 --> 01:21:49,685
We didn't notice
what was happening.

736
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:53,858
Then the soldiers
began to shot.

737
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:57,495
<i>The strike committee,
stood up...</i>

738
01:21:57,495 --> 01:21:59,429
<i>... at the balcony with
the flag.</i>

739
01:21:59,531 --> 01:22:01,624
<i>They were the first to fall.</i>

740
01:22:02,734 --> 01:22:06,170
<i>The men were running the
streets, bleeding.</i>

741
01:22:07,772 --> 01:22:10,764
<i>More than three thousand
workers were killed.</i>

742
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:15,472
We covered our ears...

743
01:22:16,414 --> 01:22:18,177
...we didn't want to listen.

744
01:22:19,317 --> 01:22:21,251
We didn't want to know.

745
01:22:22,887 --> 01:22:25,447
Then they stabbed them
with bayonets.

746
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:29,094
During the next days they
were working,...

747
01:22:29,094 --> 01:22:30,891
...getting out the bodies

748
01:22:51,416 --> 01:22:53,384
First, you put in the gunpowder.

749
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:56,319
Fuse.

750
01:22:57,922 --> 01:23:02,450
Then fill
it with earth, carefully.

751
01:23:04,562 --> 01:23:06,587
The fuse goes out here.

752
01:23:09,668 --> 01:23:11,659
Squeeze it, slowly.

753
01:23:16,007 --> 01:23:17,702
Now, we take the jar...

754
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,901
...and we put it here. Calameño.

755
01:23:23,048 --> 01:23:24,811
Then we light it.

756
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:27,852
Once the fuse is lighted...

757
01:23:27,852 --> 01:23:30,455
...we count until five
and throw.

758
01:23:30,455 --> 01:23:31,456
Excuse me, fellow...

759
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:31,820
Excuse me, fellow...

760
01:23:32,757 --> 01:23:36,784
One... Two... Three...
Four... Five!

761
01:23:37,228 --> 01:23:40,322
- Did you understand?
- We will explain it again.

762
01:23:40,465 --> 01:23:42,558
- Did you see?
- Yes.

763
01:23:43,535 --> 01:23:46,561
We have gunpowder, fuse...

764
01:23:47,205 --> 01:23:48,797
When I was going
to take the train.

765
01:23:48,973 --> 01:23:50,770
<i>Why do you have fear,
Gregorio?</i>

766
01:23:51,676 --> 01:23:54,770
<i>No, it's not the fear,
I told her...</i>

767
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:58,112
<i>... but she was always
repeating it to me.</i>

768
01:23:59,217 --> 01:24:01,947
<i>There's something inside you that I
don't understand, Gregorio...</i>

769
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:04,511
<i>... you are always watching...</i>

770
01:24:04,856 --> 01:24:06,847
<i>... like waiting.</i>

771
01:24:08,093 --> 01:24:09,856
<i>What are you looking for,
Gregorio?</i>

772
01:24:10,995 --> 01:24:13,589
<i>Ever since I can remember
we have been massacred.</i>

773
01:24:14,699 --> 01:24:17,635
<i>We march with the fists
clenched, raising...</i>

774
01:24:17,635 --> 01:24:19,227
<i>... the flags.</i>

775
01:24:19,604 --> 01:24:20,004
<i>They come with their rifles and
their bullets and death...</i>

776
01:24:20,004 --> 01:24:23,475
<i>They come with their rifles and
their bullets and death...</i>

777
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:25,602
<i>... that starts to tear you.</i>

778
01:24:25,877 --> 01:24:29,438
<i>So one thinks it is necessary
to look for other ways.</i>

779
01:24:29,814 --> 01:24:32,612
<i>That is not possible to
let them kill you each time...</i>

780
01:24:33,184 --> 01:24:37,018
<i>... so, one searches,
one waits.</i>

781
01:24:38,056 --> 01:24:39,956
<i>Do you understand
what I mean?</i>

782
01:24:51,202 --> 01:24:54,968
Gregorio, Gregorio!

783
01:25:54,933 --> 01:25:57,101
Artillery to soften,
rifles to finish off.

784
01:25:57,101 --> 01:26:00,070
Artillery to soften,
rifles to finish off.

785
01:26:01,906 --> 01:26:04,670
Cavalry to chase...
- A drink, Troncoso?

786
01:26:27,065 --> 01:26:29,966
Everything ready, Espinoza?
- Everything ready, Troncoso.

787
01:26:39,010 --> 01:26:41,045
Soldiers of the fatherland's!

788
01:26:41,045 --> 01:26:44,139
The enemy is in front of us and
we will exterminate him!

789
01:26:44,282 --> 01:26:45,750
Long live Chile!
Long live!

790
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:46,150
Long live!

791
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:46,411
Long live!

792
01:26:50,655 --> 01:26:52,520
Long live!

793
01:26:54,592 --> 01:26:56,457
Long live!

794
01:27:03,434 --> 01:27:06,961
Three to two, fire!

795
01:27:07,839 --> 01:27:08,897
Fire!

796
01:27:35,033 --> 01:27:36,091
Fire!

797
01:27:44,776 --> 01:27:45,834
Fire!

798
01:28:19,077 --> 01:28:20,544
Fire!

799
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,357
Fire!

800
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:44,724
Fire!

801
01:30:08,853 --> 01:30:11,389
Back, Gregorio!

802
01:30:11,389 --> 01:30:13,584
Arturo, Calameño!

803
01:30:40,251 --> 01:30:41,652
Your turn, Espinoza.

804
01:30:41,652 --> 01:30:44,485
Go ahead, they ran out of bullets.

805
01:30:47,992 --> 01:30:53,862
Company to the right, walk!

806
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:38,174
Let's go to the theatre!

807
01:31:39,810 --> 01:31:41,744
We have the dynamite there!

808
01:31:41,846 --> 01:31:43,575
Its the only way to resist longer!

809
01:31:54,492 --> 01:31:58,292
No.
We must separate.

810
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:01,962
I and Calameño...

811
01:32:02,567 --> 01:32:04,296
...will go to the theatre.

812
01:32:04,669 --> 01:32:06,034
You...

813
01:32:08,139 --> 01:32:09,902
...try to escape.

814
01:32:13,211 --> 01:32:14,371
Soto.

815
01:32:16,247 --> 01:32:17,771
Take this report...

816
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:22,252
...it contains all thats
happened here.

817
01:32:23,154 --> 01:32:25,247
Show it to the fellows.

818
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:33,690
Soto, Soto!

819
01:32:35,433 --> 01:32:37,367
You and I have made mistakes...

820
01:32:38,502 --> 01:32:40,663
...but we have failed
in the name of reason.

821
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:45,673
We have been divided when
we should have been together.

822
01:32:46,077 --> 01:32:49,247
We have blindly fallen
into the game...

823
01:32:49,247 --> 01:32:51,181
...prepared by
the brains of the killer's.

824
01:32:51,515 --> 01:32:56,621
We we we... we haven't...
looked for other alliances.

825
01:32:56,621 --> 01:32:59,890
We acted with hurry.

826
01:32:59,890 --> 01:33:03,121
We haven't organized sufficiently.

827
01:33:04,862 --> 01:33:07,660
We haven't been able to
discuss our problems...

828
01:33:07,732 --> 01:33:09,859
...and look for unity!

829
01:33:14,338 --> 01:33:16,203
Go now, go now!

830
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:19,610
Go now, tell what
has happened here!

831
01:33:19,610 --> 01:33:22,602
Go and work with method,
to organize!

832
01:33:22,847 --> 01:33:25,441
Go now, go to work!

833
01:33:25,783 --> 01:33:27,051
To organize!

834
01:33:27,051 --> 01:33:30,354
So tomorrow, the strength of all
the workers be united...

835
01:33:30,354 --> 01:33:36,259
...with the conscience, Soto,
with the reason.

836
01:34:05,089 --> 01:34:07,580
Calameño, come on.

837
01:34:44,962 --> 01:34:46,554
If they run like that...

838
01:34:47,732 --> 01:34:49,962
...is because are loaded
with dynamite.

839
01:35:30,875 --> 01:35:32,934
Get out of here, get out!

840
01:35:33,878 --> 01:35:39,248
Get out, come on!
Get out, get out of here!

841
01:35:43,654 --> 01:35:46,487
Enclose the theater,
by the four corners.

842
01:35:50,127 --> 01:35:53,893
Lieutenant, take the charge,
a patrol to the school.

843
01:35:53,964 --> 01:35:55,499
I need all the children here.

844
01:35:55,499 --> 01:35:57,160
Yes, captain.

845
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:30,961
They are my pupils.

846
01:36:31,302 --> 01:36:33,634
You shouldn't get
involved, lady.

847
01:36:35,306 --> 01:36:36,637
Come on!

848
01:37:10,441 --> 01:37:12,466
Why do you want the
children, captain?

849
01:37:17,047 --> 01:37:20,380
They have dynamite, if I send
a patrol, they will blow up with it.

850
01:37:20,918 --> 01:37:22,786
Therefore, I prefer that
the children go with...

851
01:37:22,786 --> 01:37:24,276
...the soldiers.

852
01:37:25,789 --> 01:37:27,848
Is this your war, captain?

853
01:37:28,759 --> 01:37:30,249
This is my war.

854
01:37:31,829 --> 01:37:34,389
- Take them to the theater!
- Don't touch the children!

855
01:37:38,802 --> 01:37:41,430
Don't do anything until
I return.

856
01:37:44,608 --> 01:37:46,633
You two, go with her!

857
01:37:52,383 --> 01:37:54,749
You have ten minutes!

858
01:38:57,548 --> 01:39:00,608
I'm Luisa, the schoolteacher.

859
01:39:07,791 --> 01:39:09,656
They have the children.

860
01:39:11,228 --> 01:39:12,820
There's nothing to do.

861
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:14,925
You have to come out.

862
01:39:23,907 --> 01:39:25,841
They took the children.

863
01:41:35,539 --> 01:41:38,208
You won't sleep until you
tell us about...

864
01:41:38,208 --> 01:41:42,941
...your fellows' plans?
What are their names?

865
01:41:44,481 --> 01:41:46,779
Where are they going?

866
01:41:51,321 --> 01:41:54,381
- Look for his family.
- He doesn't have one, captain.

867
01:42:52,015 --> 01:42:54,142
No, no, no.

868
01:43:02,659 --> 01:43:05,059
Don't eat like that.

869
01:43:05,796 --> 01:43:08,287
Didn't you learn to eat?

870
01:43:10,334 --> 01:43:12,859
Didn't you learn how to
eat when you were a child?

871
01:43:15,806 --> 01:43:16,966
Come.

872
01:43:18,175 --> 01:43:19,642
Come, come.

873
01:43:21,612 --> 01:43:24,137
Come, come.

874
01:43:32,923 --> 01:43:34,754
Look...

875
01:43:41,231 --> 01:43:44,223
...this is the blood of the
children of Marusia.

876
01:43:47,170 --> 01:43:49,764
This is the blood of your
fellows.

877
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:52,431
This is the blood of
your mother.

878
01:44:18,936 --> 01:44:21,336
Gregorio!

879
01:45:17,961 --> 01:45:21,158
You are not a man,
you are a beast!

880
01:45:21,465 --> 01:45:23,626
Shit in your trousers!

881
01:45:47,858 --> 01:45:50,418
All has been useless.

882
01:45:52,829 --> 01:45:54,456
Why do you shut up?

883
01:45:54,998 --> 01:45:56,727
Let's talk.

884
01:45:57,701 --> 01:46:01,660
I haven't hit you,
other people did that.

885
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:12,605
You have a scratch on
your cheek.

886
01:46:14,284 --> 01:46:16,912
When you came back home
theyll have to cure you.

887
01:46:21,091 --> 01:46:22,926
Do you want me to tell you
something I've been thinking...

888
01:46:22,926 --> 01:46:25,019
...all these days?

889
01:46:27,864 --> 01:46:30,059
Suddenly, I started doubting.

890
01:46:31,968 --> 01:46:33,333
What?

891
01:46:34,871 --> 01:46:35,929
Well...

892
01:46:37,507 --> 01:46:39,532
...about the final result.

893
01:46:44,181 --> 01:46:45,614
I should go.

894
01:46:46,950 --> 01:46:49,219
Some of your fellows
escaped to...

895
01:46:49,219 --> 01:46:50,846
...Ponteverde and La Coruña.

896
01:46:51,755 --> 01:46:55,088
And by now they will
be trying to raise other places.

897
01:46:57,194 --> 01:47:00,425
The more people we kill,
the more appear.

898
01:47:02,199 --> 01:47:04,895
Don't you notice
that you are weaker?

899
01:47:05,502 --> 01:47:07,197
Even though you are many more!

900
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:29,621
Squad one, fire!

901
01:47:29,759 --> 01:47:32,353
Squad two, fire!

902
01:47:35,665 --> 01:47:39,032
Squad three, fire!

903
01:47:40,237 --> 01:47:43,764
Fire!

904
01:48:04,861 --> 01:48:06,328
Lieutenant!

905
01:48:07,197 --> 01:48:09,165
Lieutenant!

906
01:48:27,884 --> 01:48:31,513
<i>On the August 17th, 1907...</i>

907
01:48:32,222 --> 01:48:35,089
<i>... I begin to write these
minutes from Marusia...</i>

908
01:48:35,425 --> 01:48:37,794
<i>... with the aim of leaving
a testimony that helps...</i>

909
01:48:37,794 --> 01:48:40,388
<i>... in our class struggle.</i>

910
01:48:41,364 --> 01:48:44,765
<i>Today is Monday and like
all the days...</i>

911
01:48:45,068 --> 01:48:48,271
<i>... Go and work with a method,
to organize!</i>

912
01:48:48,271 --> 01:48:50,501
<i>To work, to organize!</i>

913
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:54,077
<i>So that tomorrow the strength
of all the workers will be united...</i>

914
01:48:54,077 --> 01:48:59,515
<i>... with the conscience, Soto
with the reason!</i>
