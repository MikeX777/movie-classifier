1
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,455
Stop, thief! Stop, thief!

2
00:02:58,627 --> 00:02:59,616
Thirsty, eh?

3
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:06,206
Oh, you and the girls! Hurry... let's go!

4
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:07,303
I'll come back.

5
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:18,980
Back there! Make room!

6
00:03:25,635 --> 00:03:26,624
Monkeys!

7
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:31,970
- Am I late?
- A little.

8
00:03:31,971 --> 00:03:32,960
Well, here I am.

9
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:43,445
Please, Madame.

10
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:50,211
Away, away from there...

11
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:06,006
He wanted to help me.

12
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,359
That swine?

13
00:04:09,154 --> 00:04:10,416
Make him bow.

14
00:04:13,602 --> 00:04:14,626
Lower!

15
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:27,980
- One day I'll...
- Look... It's hers.

16
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:30,689
- Bravo!
- Who is she?

17
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:33,312
Madame de Ferrussac,
the wife of the head of Police.

18
00:04:33,313 --> 00:04:34,405
They're starting.

19
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:36,444
Not without him.

20
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:46,791
Here comes the culprit.

21
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,515
He looks so young.

22
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:24,083
I'll never get used to it.

23
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,823
You'd be the only one.

24
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,509
What has he done?

25
00:05:40,993 --> 00:05:42,824
He stole two apples.

26
00:06:03,872 --> 00:06:06,306
Spare him nothing.

27
00:06:22,368 --> 00:06:24,996
Take a good look.
Our turn tomorrow!

28
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:26,972
Tomorrow?

29
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:28,380
Don't worry.

30
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:53,787
Let's go.

31
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:01,524
All for Malichot?

32
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,964
His share...
and watch out if you don't...

33
00:07:09,822 --> 00:07:11,722
You're not scared of Malichot?

34
00:07:12,254 --> 00:07:14,154
He's our leader... and don't forget it.

35
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:15,462
You're hurting me.

36
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,024
Good evening, Dominique.
Good evening, Louison.

37
00:07:31,678 --> 00:07:33,373
Good evening, sparrow brain.

38
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:41,019
Malichot in?

39
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:42,987
He's coming down now.

40
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,619
Clumsy!

41
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:01,268
Get a sniff of the perfume!

42
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:02,505
Smells like a pig sty...

43
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:03,958
And this is a good day!

44
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,622
Had a good day, eh?

45
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:06,857
Yes, handsome.

46
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:08,821
Some get all the luck, eh!

47
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,004
Trust Dominique to get his way.

48
00:08:11,005 --> 00:08:11,994
Thanks, sweetie.

49
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:14,074
How about Malichot?

50
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:15,041
Here I am!

51
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:25,146
So am I.

52
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:32,720
Feeling proud?

53
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:35,461
I've got every reason to be.

54
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:41,556
That's all?

55
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:44,057
I forgot.

56
00:08:46,204 --> 00:08:47,193
Amusing...

57
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,898
For you.

58
00:08:57,116 --> 00:08:58,105
That's all?

59
00:08:58,588 --> 00:08:59,316
Excuse me.

60
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:14,023
Next.

61
00:09:24,027 --> 00:09:25,187
Crafty.

62
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:26,570
Look me in the face.

63
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:29,433
Search him.

64
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:36,884
Not sharing any more?

65
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,193
All right!

66
00:09:45,723 --> 00:09:46,849
He's new.

67
00:09:48,475 --> 00:09:52,122
That'll teach the young
and remind the old...

68
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:53,021
What?

69
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,088
Don't be a fool, Dominique.

70
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:58,160
You're not straight.

71
00:09:58,555 --> 00:10:00,079
Maybe you want to teach me...

72
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:04,180
...who spent ten years in the galleys...

73
00:10:04,859 --> 00:10:06,451
...how to treat dogs!

74
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,349
You accept that?

75
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,469
No one makes a move?

76
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:15,280
Not a word?
So you're dogs? Just dogs?

77
00:10:15,418 --> 00:10:16,476
See?

78
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:20,489
Don't upset yourself.
I'm about to give you a lesson.

79
00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:26,130
Missed.

80
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:28,099
There's one too many around here.

81
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,290
Who?

82
00:10:30,362 --> 00:10:31,590
Better be careful.

83
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:34,995
They obey me from one end
of Paris to the other.

84
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,044
You'd be met by men on every street.

85
00:10:38,778 --> 00:10:40,336
If I got rid of you...

86
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:44,206
You... you wouldn't...

87
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:47,696
Forget it, Dominique.

88
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,695
Don't be a fool, we work together.

89
00:10:51,546 --> 00:10:53,207
You're not going to...

90
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:55,431
What? Stomp on you?

91
00:10:55,673 --> 00:10:57,698
I might slip, like on dirt.

92
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:02,957
Get him!

93
00:11:16,473 --> 00:11:20,888
Get him... alive if possible!

94
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:21,981
He won't go far.

95
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:38,155
You beat Malichot.

96
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:39,157
We must vanish.

97
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:56,496
On your left!

98
00:11:56,824 --> 00:11:58,815
On your right! There you are!

99
00:12:14,008 --> 00:12:15,999
- It's bad...
- What happened?

100
00:12:16,184 --> 00:12:17,082
Malichot...

101
00:12:19,832 --> 00:12:24,201
We collected all the girls
and all the food...

102
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:25,428
Come with me.

103
00:12:25,976 --> 00:12:28,342
Lie low till he forgets you.

104
00:12:29,047 --> 00:12:32,438
No time to be bored.

105
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:33,633
Customer for you.

106
00:12:34,103 --> 00:12:35,570
Welcome! It's my round.

107
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:37,734
So they feed you in the army?

108
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:39,512
That's what I said.

109
00:12:39,544 --> 00:12:43,510
Food, money and girls, war and glory.

110
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:47,862
Don't forget the best part...
eight pounds when you sign on.

111
00:12:47,863 --> 00:12:50,195
I don't mind being cut up if I'm fed.

112
00:12:50,423 --> 00:12:53,256
When I'm fed, I can throw an ox.

113
00:12:57,687 --> 00:13:00,121
- Done. How much?
- The start of fortune!

114
00:13:02,327 --> 00:13:04,090
- Sign where?
- Name?

115
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:06,420
Cartouche.

116
00:13:07,191 --> 00:13:09,386
You have chosen glory!

117
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:12,499
And you?

118
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,275
- Mole.
- What's that?

119
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:17,295
- Mole.
- Sign.

120
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:19,964
My name's Gentle, but I can't write.

121
00:13:20,343 --> 00:13:23,176
Never mind. Make a cross.

122
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:05,052
Retreat!

123
00:14:14,582 --> 00:14:16,174
Food for thought.

124
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:17,180
Indeed.

125
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,066
You were saying?

126
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:39,914
She was Italian...

127
00:14:40,085 --> 00:14:43,714
...with freckles on the tip of her nose.

128
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:45,296
- What for?
- Look out!

129
00:14:53,205 --> 00:14:54,194
Whose is it?

130
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,236
One of ours.

131
00:14:57,557 --> 00:14:59,616
No, it's not ours.

132
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:01,594
Better return it.

133
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:09,120
This one's ours.

134
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:11,632
I tell you, this is food for thought.

135
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,671
Bloody sharks!

136
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:27,185
That's that.

137
00:15:34,996 --> 00:15:35,985
All in order, Sir.

138
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,969
At last...

139
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:45,836
Well fought...

140
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:48,377
We're winning!

141
00:15:48,852 --> 00:15:49,841
Any left?

142
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:51,429
Trust me, Adelaide.

143
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:52,796
Over already?

144
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,649
Everything comes to an end.

145
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,561
They are heroes!

146
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:10,217
I knew it. I always do.

147
00:16:10,355 --> 00:16:11,754
I chose well.

148
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,170
Men, I'm proud of you.

149
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:22,251
The Marshal's coming!

150
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:31,400
My men, Sir.

151
00:16:31,443 --> 00:16:34,378
I want the Marshal
to express his appreciation.

152
00:16:34,386 --> 00:16:36,616
This is a great day, my friends.

153
00:16:36,626 --> 00:16:37,615
Follow me.

154
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:40,217
Sergeant, I congratulate you.

155
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:42,426
A matter of judgment, Sir.

156
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:49,504
Ladies, wait up there.

157
00:16:49,746 --> 00:16:52,544
Gentlemen, we must celebrate this.

158
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:55,769
Heroes are modest.

159
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:00,242
Well... I'm glad...

160
00:17:01,298 --> 00:17:05,489
Very glad to be... very glad...

161
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,718
...to be here.

162
00:17:06,898 --> 00:17:08,490
A victory, Sir.

163
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,555
Always in my way!

164
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,636
A victory!

165
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,393
I didn't hear what you said.

166
00:17:13,426 --> 00:17:15,053
You must be starving.

167
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,684
Dying from hunger,
or anything else...

168
00:17:19,858 --> 00:17:22,258
Death doesn't frighten a soldier.

169
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,228
Long live the Marshal!

170
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:33,776
They are delightful, delightful!

171
00:17:33,777 --> 00:17:35,608
We have matters to discuss.

172
00:17:35,857 --> 00:17:38,655
Yes... in private.

173
00:17:38,802 --> 00:17:41,777
We must conclude.

174
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:44,679
I lost 100 men today.
I hope to do better tomorrow.

175
00:17:44,721 --> 00:17:45,483
Excellent.

176
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:57,373
What is the question, exactly?

177
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:06,745
The King demands a Victory...

178
00:18:07,312 --> 00:18:09,075
...a great Victory.

179
00:18:09,393 --> 00:18:11,156
This is where it shall be.

180
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:14,512
No, excuse me, here.

181
00:18:16,273 --> 00:18:19,106
No, no. Better here.

182
00:18:19,696 --> 00:18:21,357
The Royal Languedocs here.

183
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:23,293
Here, the Royal Aquitaines...

184
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:28,179
...and I see you, personally, here.

185
00:18:28,752 --> 00:18:29,650
But it's a massacre!

186
00:18:29,712 --> 00:18:34,115
I see you understand.
I intend on being lavish.

187
00:18:38,672 --> 00:18:39,969
Well, what do you say?

188
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:44,714
You may be dead tomorrow.
Courage!

189
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,446
How about the pay, Sir?

190
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:54,200
The pay?
I've got it in my coach.

191
00:18:54,256 --> 00:18:56,588
Hand it out after the battle.

192
00:18:56,656 --> 00:18:58,988
Makes things easier...

193
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:01,026
...and more economical!

194
00:19:02,447 --> 00:19:03,436
I'm used to it.

195
00:19:07,535 --> 00:19:08,968
What? Gunshot?

196
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:11,441
Nothing, Sir... some deserter.

197
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:15,503
Get them to unload the safe.
I'm leaving.

198
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:18,510
Don't you intend
to celebrate your victory?

199
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:19,500
Alas!

200
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:20,845
Ear trouble?

201
00:19:21,007 --> 00:19:22,668
Gunshot makes them ache.

202
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:24,067
Refreshment!

203
00:19:25,135 --> 00:19:27,950
The three heroes of the day, Sir.

204
00:19:27,951 --> 00:19:31,278
Their gallant conduct carried the day!

205
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,179
Put them on the front line tomorrow.

206
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:38,094
The pay chest
from the Marshal's coach!

207
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:39,790
I'll send my men.
On the double!

208
00:19:40,335 --> 00:19:42,997
Do you always serve
such excellent champagne?

209
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,434
You never get tired!

210
00:19:45,838 --> 00:19:46,827
My dear child!

211
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,725
My dear children!

212
00:19:51,438 --> 00:19:52,427
You understood?

213
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,287
We shall be dead tomorrow.

214
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,548
I've got a better idea.

215
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:58,992
- Do we quit?
- Not empty-handed.

216
00:19:59,022 --> 00:20:01,047
That pay... but how?

217
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:03,798
The way it came here.
Watch the Sergeant.

218
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:06,315
Marshal's orders. Dismissed.

219
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:07,980
You, come here.

220
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:10,935
You go on watch.

221
00:20:11,214 --> 00:20:12,545
I'll take the watch.

222
00:20:19,182 --> 00:20:20,171
Keep a look-out.

223
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:40,087
What a pretty little face.

224
00:20:43,662 --> 00:20:45,061
You!!!

225
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,074
Bravo, Sir.

226
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:52,266
Fill the chest up with stones.

227
00:20:58,221 --> 00:20:59,552
- Okay?
- And you?

228
00:20:59,597 --> 00:21:00,461
Okay.

229
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:20,864
You bad girls!

230
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:23,139
Long live the Marshal!

231
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,742
I must leave now...

232
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:29,927
Call the Marshal's coach.

233
00:21:31,661 --> 00:21:32,958
Hurry up, hurry up!

234
00:21:33,612 --> 00:21:36,274
Pull the wheel! Pull!

235
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,456
Put it back!!

236
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,756
Push. It's got to hold for a league.

237
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,778
Pushing makes you laugh?

238
00:21:59,372 --> 00:22:00,896
I'd like to say...

239
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:02,698
They'll be the death of you.

240
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:04,894
A soldier's life has its perils.

241
00:22:07,852 --> 00:22:09,843
God speed, Marshal.

242
00:22:19,052 --> 00:22:20,542
Bring the chest to my room.

243
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:36,067
Let's go...

244
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:37,698
I shall miss being here.

245
00:22:37,739 --> 00:22:38,728
Hurry up.

246
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,599
Not long now.

247
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:33,865
I'm very glad, very glad indeed...
to be here.

248
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:36,596
But you're not, Sir.
The wheel came off.

249
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:44,044
The darling... It's just as well.
I'll take advantage of that.

250
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:45,571
Gather up the horses!

251
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,250
Five men here.

252
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,602
Heave ho!

253
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:54,662
Now!

254
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:08,523
Anything wrong?

255
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:10,214
Do you need help?

256
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:11,748
I can't understand what happened.

257
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:12,775
Let's help.

258
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:19,321
I see what it is.
Leave it to me.

259
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:32,616
Over there, all of you do-nothings!

260
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:36,997
Get hold of this. Watch out!

261
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:40,198
You too.

262
00:24:45,448 --> 00:24:46,437
Higher...

263
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:51,055
A bit lower... Look out... Lower.

264
00:24:51,912 --> 00:24:54,210
A little higher. Excuse me, lower...

265
00:24:55,849 --> 00:24:57,680
Excuse me. A bit higher.

266
00:24:58,568 --> 00:24:59,557
Just a bit higher. There.

267
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,198
That's it.

268
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:09,388
Thanks.

269
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:10,597
Ready to mount.

270
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:15,129
Waiting for orders, Sir.

271
00:25:21,384 --> 00:25:22,851
The evening air's quite chilly.

272
00:25:23,943 --> 00:25:25,570
What a gallant lot...

273
00:25:28,488 --> 00:25:29,477
Off we go!

274
00:25:29,767 --> 00:25:30,756
At my command...

275
00:25:31,368 --> 00:25:32,357
Ready to mount...

276
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:36,799
On your saddles!

277
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,137
It's an ambush! Help!

278
00:26:06,215 --> 00:26:08,342
Here we are, Marshal!

279
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:14,278
Here's your cushion, Sir.

280
00:26:15,303 --> 00:26:16,292
What happened?

281
00:26:41,126 --> 00:26:42,787
This way, come here.

282
00:26:46,886 --> 00:26:49,116
Everyone strip!
Hand over your clothes.

283
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:50,118
We'll pay.

284
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,894
Go on, hurry up!

285
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:05,586
Three cheers for the army!

286
00:27:11,206 --> 00:27:13,140
I've always been a nature lover.

287
00:27:14,245 --> 00:27:15,576
Sunshine!

288
00:27:18,565 --> 00:27:20,897
The pay-chest... my coach...

289
00:27:21,254 --> 00:27:23,779
The enemy... where am I?

290
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:28,401
I am here, Sir. Fear nothing.

291
00:27:32,165 --> 00:27:33,154
Stones...!

292
00:27:34,949 --> 00:27:36,075
A coach gone!

293
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:39,396
The laughing stock of the court!
I demand an explanation!

294
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:40,364
I think...

295
00:27:40,421 --> 00:27:42,852
Silence. Where's the gold?

296
00:27:42,853 --> 00:27:43,842
It was there.

297
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:47,428
Silence.
Where's the recruiting sergeant?

298
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:50,023
We found him. Here he is.

299
00:27:50,245 --> 00:27:54,306
Who were they?
What were their names?

300
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:58,068
I congratulate you on your recruits!

301
00:27:58,308 --> 00:28:02,039
You've got two days
to find the gold. Take three men.

302
00:28:02,277 --> 00:28:05,735
It's as good as found, Sir.
I swear, you can rely on me.

303
00:28:07,364 --> 00:28:08,353
Sorry, Sir.

304
00:28:11,685 --> 00:28:12,674
Follow me.

305
00:28:21,796 --> 00:28:22,694
Inn-keeper...

306
00:28:24,164 --> 00:28:25,096
I could eat an ox!

307
00:28:25,124 --> 00:28:27,875
I'll buy the barrels the roast, the lot...

308
00:28:27,876 --> 00:28:29,468
Put it on that table.

309
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:30,839
Show them to the barn.

310
00:28:31,428 --> 00:28:32,417
I said, the barn.

311
00:28:36,772 --> 00:28:39,639
Gentlemen, you shall have game.

312
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,580
I'm paying.

313
00:28:41,892 --> 00:28:43,223
Plenty of garlic!

314
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:47,629
You're sorry now, you little wretch.

315
00:28:47,908 --> 00:28:49,398
It's the onion, you fathead.

316
00:28:49,635 --> 00:28:51,000
Who taught you to talk?

317
00:28:51,044 --> 00:28:53,410
I did. Eat, so I can go on crying.

318
00:28:54,563 --> 00:28:56,690
I can't blow my nose.
You stole my handkerchief.

319
00:28:56,963 --> 00:28:59,779
Stole!
Calling us thieves?

320
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,769
We're family men!

321
00:29:00,835 --> 00:29:02,860
What's a family?

322
00:29:02,883 --> 00:29:05,545
I've got no family.
I did have a silk handkerchief.

323
00:29:05,923 --> 00:29:07,185
You stole it.

324
00:29:08,035 --> 00:29:09,502
It looked better on me.

325
00:29:22,243 --> 00:29:23,733
What do we drink?

326
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:25,453
Chateauneuf...

327
00:29:25,506 --> 00:29:26,495
...du Pape...

328
00:29:26,882 --> 00:29:28,713
They smell bad.

329
00:29:29,891 --> 00:29:30,915
Who smells bad?

330
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:34,385
I said who?

331
00:29:34,466 --> 00:29:35,899
Both fat and ugly.

332
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:36,837
Me?

333
00:29:36,898 --> 00:29:37,796
Who is he?

334
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:39,340
How much for both girls?

335
00:29:39,395 --> 00:29:41,659
These two are beginning to annoy me.

336
00:29:44,962 --> 00:29:45,951
Fetch the other.

337
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:47,178
By all means.

338
00:29:49,282 --> 00:29:50,442
Over there.

339
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,123
Do your duty.

340
00:30:05,442 --> 00:30:06,932
- Lost something?
- Missed the step.

341
00:30:07,202 --> 00:30:08,533
So where were you going?

342
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:11,743
This way then...

343
00:30:20,258 --> 00:30:21,247
What a day!

344
00:30:23,361 --> 00:30:25,795
Drinks for the ladies.

345
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,515
Your story?

346
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:32,666
My name is Venus. I'm nineteen...
No parents, but lots of lovers.

347
00:30:32,802 --> 00:30:34,895
They say I can't talk, but I can dance.

348
00:30:34,945 --> 00:30:37,038
I steal... and I live.

349
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:37,818
And you?

350
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:42,302
Need me?

351
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:44,371
Who needs a monk?

352
00:30:44,513 --> 00:30:45,707
The robe's nothing...

353
00:30:46,081 --> 00:30:48,049
If you don't like it, I can change it.

354
00:30:48,065 --> 00:30:49,930
I like a change.

355
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,070
Jack of all trades...

356
00:30:51,425 --> 00:30:53,586
Poulterer, sailor, violinist...

357
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,592
I've even been a nun once.

358
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:58,817
We don't want your life story.
Eat!

359
00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:02,161
Brother... brother Capucine...

360
00:31:03,232 --> 00:31:05,097
You got caught for a handkerchief?

361
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:06,627
Just a kerchief?

362
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:09,761
It was silk, and so beautiful.

363
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,217
I've got ideas for you.

364
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,959
This time I've caught you!
En grade!

365
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,622
Sergeant, it's us!

366
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,496
That's enough for today.
We'll stop at the next inn.

367
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,287
Can you cook?

368
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,618
Yes. And walk on my hands...

369
00:32:28,703 --> 00:32:30,068
...and dance on a tight-rope...

370
00:32:30,463 --> 00:32:31,487
...play the violin...

371
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:32,988
...train goats...

372
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,177
...and sew hems.

373
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:36,689
Should I keep you?

374
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:48,188
Keep a secret?

375
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:49,627
Of course.

376
00:32:50,527 --> 00:32:51,516
Come with me.

377
00:32:51,774 --> 00:32:53,241
What can you do?

378
00:32:54,686 --> 00:32:55,414
Me?

379
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,793
Venus is sleepy...

380
00:33:03,134 --> 00:33:05,364
Capucine, you keep watch.

381
00:33:07,774 --> 00:33:08,934
My little thief...

382
00:33:20,158 --> 00:33:21,147
What is it?

383
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:23,344
State property.

384
00:33:28,318 --> 00:33:29,478
Promise me...

385
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:31,302
Anything you like.

386
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,153
I want to sleep on straw always.

387
00:33:35,198 --> 00:33:35,926
Promised.

388
00:33:44,957 --> 00:33:45,855
What's wrong?

389
00:33:54,237 --> 00:33:55,135
What is it?

390
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:57,274
Those bags, quick.

391
00:33:57,533 --> 00:33:58,522
The bags!

392
00:33:59,357 --> 00:34:00,949
Put the gold in that coach and go!

393
00:34:00,989 --> 00:34:03,617
- Where?
- La Courtille...

394
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:06,697
Ask for Louison, my brother,
and wait for me.

395
00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:09,013
- And you?
- I'll meet you there. Watch out!

396
00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:24,314
Inn-keeper!

397
00:34:25,084 --> 00:34:26,073
Anybody there?

398
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,089
Nobody about?

399
00:34:28,797 --> 00:34:30,697
Alone, girls?

400
00:34:30,717 --> 00:34:31,706
Yes, sergeant.

401
00:34:33,597 --> 00:34:35,258
What's that noise?

402
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,929
Where's the girl?

403
00:34:40,316 --> 00:34:41,374
The scoundrels!

404
00:34:41,437 --> 00:34:42,426
Who was it?

405
00:34:42,716 --> 00:34:44,149
What happened?

406
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,653
- The thief!
- The slut!

407
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,560
Three peasants. Three rogues...

408
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,410
With gold...

409
00:34:48,476 --> 00:34:49,602
Gold? Where?

410
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,592
On the table.

411
00:34:52,956 --> 00:34:54,981
My goodness! It's them!

412
00:34:55,196 --> 00:34:55,855
My sword.

413
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,194
Sorry, they're mine!

414
00:34:58,236 --> 00:34:59,225
You realize who I am?

415
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:00,919
Quiet... or you're a dead man.

416
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,009
How dare you!

417
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:04,857
Excuse me.

418
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,272
Go ahead, Father.

419
00:35:13,756 --> 00:35:15,246
Sergeant.

420
00:35:15,451 --> 00:35:16,611
Can you see now?

421
00:35:16,667 --> 00:35:18,760
Good of you to come.

422
00:35:19,932 --> 00:35:21,126
Where's the third one?

423
00:35:21,403 --> 00:35:23,428
Hands up, everybody!

424
00:35:23,676 --> 00:35:28,841
Dominique. It's the Sergeant...
Recognize him?

425
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:31,864
Idiots...

426
00:35:33,276 --> 00:35:34,106
The gold?

427
00:35:34,236 --> 00:35:35,726
The gold? In the cart.

428
00:35:36,156 --> 00:35:36,815
What gold?

429
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:39,191
You know it very well...

430
00:35:39,195 --> 00:35:40,184
In the barn.

431
00:35:40,315 --> 00:35:42,613
In the hay.

432
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:45,675
Barn... cart... hay...
I get it. Hold them.

433
00:35:48,955 --> 00:35:51,287
A barn, a cart...

434
00:35:51,418 --> 00:35:52,715
A cart and some hay!

435
00:35:55,803 --> 00:35:59,899
A cart... hay... Scoundrels!

436
00:36:05,403 --> 00:36:06,461
Tell me, Beautiful.

437
00:36:07,194 --> 00:36:08,252
You are beautiful!

438
00:36:11,354 --> 00:36:14,517
Has Beautiful seen anything?

439
00:36:15,194 --> 00:36:18,493
Seen what, Mr. Officer?

440
00:36:18,618 --> 00:36:21,246
Three robbers, three bandits...

441
00:36:21,434 --> 00:36:22,765
Bandits!

442
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:25,210
Fear nothing. I am here.

443
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,708
Are you alone?

444
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:30,627
You should be ashamed...

445
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:32,294
Excuse me, father...

446
00:36:32,474 --> 00:36:34,457
He did nothing...
There are bandits.

447
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,117
Bandits!

448
00:36:35,162 --> 00:36:37,625
- Don't leave me...
- I shan't, child.

449
00:36:37,626 --> 00:36:40,254
Fear nothing... Bandits...

450
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,878
There's no longer
any law and order...

451
00:36:46,266 --> 00:36:49,565
Fear nothing, I've got them!

452
00:36:49,881 --> 00:36:51,348
There, perfect.

453
00:37:16,793 --> 00:37:19,455
Feeling sleepy?
This'll wake you up!

454
00:37:31,353 --> 00:37:34,720
We'll kill you
for such impertinence.

455
00:37:39,993 --> 00:37:41,392
If you insist...

456
00:37:57,912 --> 00:37:59,243
Look out, behind...

457
00:38:00,952 --> 00:38:02,283
I could do with a drink.

458
00:38:14,552 --> 00:38:15,712
This way, please.

459
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:53,962
Like peaches, Fatty.

460
00:38:59,447 --> 00:39:00,505
Better be careful.

461
00:39:01,398 --> 00:39:02,422
Little wretch...

462
00:39:03,031 --> 00:39:06,023
This one has a knot...
I'll get a smaller one.

463
00:39:06,102 --> 00:39:08,093
No... you can't!

464
00:39:08,151 --> 00:39:09,140
You'll see!

465
00:39:29,302 --> 00:39:31,532
I was so worried!

466
00:39:31,574 --> 00:39:33,667
Poor little fellow.

467
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:39,084
Be warned. I'm gentle but efficient.

468
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,821
Shove the lot in the cellar.

469
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,951
Just those three.
The others this way.

470
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,741
I shall complain. This will go far.

471
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:58,740
We are colleagues.

472
00:39:58,806 --> 00:40:00,273
Silence! To bed!

473
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,096
I'm half dead. You keep guard.

474
00:40:03,414 --> 00:40:05,405
One hour in turn, until morning.

475
00:40:06,806 --> 00:40:08,034
Sergeant...

476
00:40:08,149 --> 00:40:09,207
A fine fellow!

477
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:13,537
Pathetic!

478
00:40:14,805 --> 00:40:15,794
Useless!

479
00:41:11,508 --> 00:41:12,839
What a night!

480
00:41:13,588 --> 00:41:16,182
A night like no other.

481
00:41:16,212 --> 00:41:18,237
Slept it off, have you?

482
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:18,951
What?

483
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,027
Let's get out.

484
00:41:20,084 --> 00:41:20,982
Out of where?

485
00:41:21,364 --> 00:41:23,764
Don't you see? Rats in traps.

486
00:41:23,764 --> 00:41:24,662
True.

487
00:41:24,724 --> 00:41:26,316
All because of the girls.

488
00:41:26,548 --> 00:41:28,413
How do we get out?

489
00:41:28,788 --> 00:41:30,779
Through the door. Listen.

490
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:36,726
What is it?

491
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:39,975
We've thought. Call the Sergeant.

492
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:57,738
- They want to talk.
- Who?

493
00:41:57,779 --> 00:41:58,768
The rough necks.

494
00:42:00,148 --> 00:42:01,137
I knew it!

495
00:42:01,267 --> 00:42:03,895
I'll make them talk... and sing!

496
00:43:10,706 --> 00:43:12,867
Dominique is back!

497
00:43:13,906 --> 00:43:16,067
Is that why you bother me?

498
00:43:16,082 --> 00:43:17,413
Lmportant news, eh?

499
00:43:17,746 --> 00:43:20,271
I keep to my word! Stomp on him.

500
00:43:20,657 --> 00:43:21,988
Wipe him out!

501
00:43:36,465 --> 00:43:40,128
So, that's that. I marry you.

502
00:43:40,977 --> 00:43:42,774
- Thought it over?
- Yes.

503
00:43:45,745 --> 00:43:46,734
I've thought!

504
00:43:47,185 --> 00:43:49,016
Such passion...

505
00:43:52,305 --> 00:43:56,469
Wants to leave
her little husband already?

506
00:43:56,593 --> 00:43:58,959
You can kill me.
Dominique gets his gold.

507
00:43:58,961 --> 00:44:02,727
But it's your gold, my beauty.
It's all here, and all yours.

508
00:44:03,025 --> 00:44:04,117
It's Dominique's.

509
00:44:05,008 --> 00:44:06,168
Poor Dominique.

510
00:44:06,961 --> 00:44:08,758
You'll wait a long time.

511
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,093
That's a lie!

512
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:15,617
Before he returns,
you'll have grandchildren.

513
00:44:15,888 --> 00:44:18,288
Maybe even great grandchildren...

514
00:44:18,608 --> 00:44:19,597
You dirty dog...

515
00:44:22,256 --> 00:44:23,382
Swine!

516
00:44:24,784 --> 00:44:26,945
Almost a menagerie!

517
00:44:28,592 --> 00:44:31,618
Go on. You've got five minutes.

518
00:44:32,048 --> 00:44:34,380
Five minutes, or else Louison...

519
00:44:36,879 --> 00:44:37,971
Louison...

520
00:44:46,256 --> 00:44:47,348
Here's Dominique.

521
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,145
I'm Cartouche.

522
00:44:49,648 --> 00:44:51,639
You're mad coming here.

523
00:44:51,664 --> 00:44:53,632
Do you think
Malichot's forgotten you?

524
00:44:53,711 --> 00:44:57,909
Go ahead. Let him know.
I won't stay, so hurry up.

525
00:44:59,504 --> 00:45:00,493
What's new?

526
00:45:00,847 --> 00:45:02,872
Seen Louison?

527
00:45:03,023 --> 00:45:04,183
Not for some time.

528
00:45:04,304 --> 00:45:06,135
Did a girl called Venus ask for me?

529
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:08,775
- Some time ago?
- No. This morning...

530
00:45:09,104 --> 00:45:10,264
I was hoping...

531
00:45:10,351 --> 00:45:11,340
I heard nothing.

532
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:14,319
There you have it.

533
00:45:14,799 --> 00:45:16,027
That's what happens.

534
00:45:17,103 --> 00:45:18,764
Thought she'd wait for you, eh?

535
00:45:18,863 --> 00:45:19,761
Certain.

536
00:45:19,823 --> 00:45:22,621
Your winning ways! Poor man.

537
00:45:23,183 --> 00:45:26,516
A woman... and a thief as well.

538
00:45:26,543 --> 00:45:29,205
Say nothing against the ladies.

539
00:45:37,391 --> 00:45:38,255
Where's Venus?

540
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:39,307
She's charming.

541
00:45:40,398 --> 00:45:41,296
Where is she?

542
00:45:42,222 --> 00:45:43,211
Let him talk.

543
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,396
She came by this morning.

544
00:45:45,423 --> 00:45:47,789
Asked for Louison.
Then they disappeared.

545
00:45:47,822 --> 00:45:49,312
I get it! Follow me!

546
00:45:52,846 --> 00:45:54,245
Keep an eye on them.

547
00:46:00,046 --> 00:46:02,276
Where is she? Where's Louison?

548
00:46:02,382 --> 00:46:04,043
I did nothing.

549
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:05,008
The cart?

550
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:05,968
I did nothing...

551
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:07,874
Found anything in the cart?

552
00:46:08,174 --> 00:46:09,539
Do you hear?

553
00:46:09,966 --> 00:46:13,231
Was there nothing in the cart?

554
00:46:13,582 --> 00:46:14,571
And?

555
00:46:14,862 --> 00:46:16,853
I had to tell someone.

556
00:46:16,878 --> 00:46:17,867
Who to?

557
00:46:18,862 --> 00:46:19,760
Malichot.

558
00:46:19,822 --> 00:46:20,811
Malichot!

559
00:46:21,773 --> 00:46:24,742
Louison, and Venus, and the gold...
All to Malichot!

560
00:46:26,542 --> 00:46:27,702
To Malichot!

561
00:46:30,382 --> 00:46:32,111
All hell is going to break loose.

562
00:46:32,462 --> 00:46:33,360
Pity...

563
00:46:33,805 --> 00:46:35,238
The Mole!

564
00:46:50,062 --> 00:46:51,586
Who is Malichot?

565
00:46:51,661 --> 00:46:52,559
You'll meet him.

566
00:46:54,989 --> 00:46:56,081
I'll never be yours.

567
00:47:04,557 --> 00:47:08,459
You're crying? It's pretty to see.

568
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:09,858
You can tear my eyes out...

569
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:12,802
You'll be mine all the same.

570
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:14,890
No, mine!

571
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,632
Get down and don't move.

572
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,969
Excuse me a minute.

573
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,089
Set Louison free.

574
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:25,739
You, come here.
You thought I was avoiding you.

575
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:29,073
I was doing all I could to see you again.

576
00:47:33,261 --> 00:47:34,250
Old Malichot!

577
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,211
Not as bad as he seemed.

578
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:48,820
Look at him...

579
00:47:51,596 --> 00:47:52,585
Touch him...

580
00:47:53,644 --> 00:47:54,633
Well, go on...

581
00:47:58,475 --> 00:47:59,305
Frightened, are you?

582
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,503
Or frightened of me?

583
00:48:07,627 --> 00:48:08,821
You must choose.

584
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,660
Him or me?

585
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,842
How about the others? No others?

586
00:48:24,107 --> 00:48:26,575
Pity I've got my men.
I admire courage.

587
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:28,667
I say, long live Dominique...

588
00:48:28,715 --> 00:48:32,344
Yesterday the swine,
today Dominique...

589
00:48:32,363 --> 00:48:33,352
Who tomorrow?

590
00:48:33,419 --> 00:48:35,080
Long live Dominique!

591
00:48:41,259 --> 00:48:41,918
Stop!

592
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:47,063
I hate bloodshed.

593
00:48:47,179 --> 00:48:48,669
Wash him. He stinks.

594
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:51,090
Make him stay at home, my home...

595
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:53,388
...until he can stand on his feet.

596
00:49:01,259 --> 00:49:03,887
Now where's my gold?

597
00:49:08,299 --> 00:49:09,288
I love you.

598
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:10,764
Naturally.

599
00:49:22,058 --> 00:49:23,457
To the fairest first!

600
00:49:25,418 --> 00:49:26,510
Now you two.

601
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:32,462
You take the rest.

602
00:49:32,618 --> 00:49:33,949
Long live Dominique!

603
00:49:34,218 --> 00:49:35,549
His name is Cartouche.

604
00:49:35,626 --> 00:49:37,253
Long live Cartouche!

605
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:38,587
Long live Cartouche!

606
00:49:38,634 --> 00:49:40,499
Long live Cartouche!

607
00:49:40,554 --> 00:49:41,543
You lead us.

608
00:49:42,057 --> 00:49:42,989
You want me to?

609
00:49:43,081 --> 00:49:43,843
Yes.

610
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:45,074
You shall have me.

611
00:49:46,282 --> 00:49:47,476
Follow me blindly.

612
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:48,284
Yes.

613
00:49:48,362 --> 00:49:49,829
No need to say yes. I said it.

614
00:49:50,634 --> 00:49:52,932
Let bygones be bygones.
My laws are...

615
00:49:53,418 --> 00:49:55,909
No bloodshed.
Aim at the powerful.

616
00:49:56,585 --> 00:49:59,816
Why should only they
have feathers and laces...

617
00:50:00,073 --> 00:50:03,592
...and go hunting
in coaches and trappings?

618
00:50:03,593 --> 00:50:04,582
What about us?

619
00:50:05,033 --> 00:50:07,160
Let us have feathers and laces...

620
00:50:07,305 --> 00:50:09,500
...hunting, coaches and trappings!

621
00:50:09,545 --> 00:50:12,878
Long live Cartouche!

622
00:50:13,865 --> 00:50:17,062
Keep accounts,
and give everyone a fair deal.

623
00:50:17,129 --> 00:50:22,226
Long live Cartouche!

624
00:50:23,465 --> 00:50:24,124
I have spoken.

625
00:51:32,136 --> 00:51:34,627
"C" and again more "C's"...

626
00:51:34,631 --> 00:51:37,691
I think it must be the same hand.

627
00:51:38,215 --> 00:51:39,204
You think so!

628
00:51:39,911 --> 00:51:42,402
Within a week, 40 horses stolen...

629
00:51:42,407 --> 00:51:44,432
...20 coaches burnt,
2 churches looted...

630
00:51:44,455 --> 00:51:47,814
...the salt barn emptied,
the Langeals home pillaged!

631
00:51:47,815 --> 00:51:48,975
Thefts in many towns...

632
00:51:49,479 --> 00:51:52,414
Everywhere the same signature...
a "C"...

633
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:54,692
...which you say is written
by the same hand!

634
00:51:54,759 --> 00:51:56,351
I am certain of it, sir.

635
00:51:57,255 --> 00:51:58,153
Whose?

636
00:51:58,630 --> 00:51:59,756
I don't know.

637
00:51:59,879 --> 00:52:00,868
We don't know.

638
00:52:01,735 --> 00:52:04,727
The Court is complaining.
He must be arrested.

639
00:52:05,575 --> 00:52:06,803
How, Sir?

640
00:52:06,951 --> 00:52:07,940
Your men...

641
00:52:08,007 --> 00:52:08,996
They are afraid.

642
00:52:09,415 --> 00:52:10,404
At ten to one...

643
00:52:10,631 --> 00:52:11,461
None left.

644
00:52:11,526 --> 00:52:12,254
Pay!

645
00:52:12,518 --> 00:52:14,986
What with? I get nothing.

646
00:52:15,014 --> 00:52:16,003
Be careful.

647
00:52:16,135 --> 00:52:19,571
Those bandits are capable
of robbing the King's own treasury.

648
00:52:54,757 --> 00:52:55,781
Which do you choose?

649
00:52:56,454 --> 00:52:57,284
Left.

650
00:53:08,998 --> 00:53:11,262
That's what I call organization!

651
00:53:33,605 --> 00:53:34,503
Who are you?

652
00:53:35,557 --> 00:53:37,491
Cartouche, with a capital "C"...

653
00:53:40,933 --> 00:53:41,922
That's that.

654
00:53:54,532 --> 00:53:59,364
What does Cartouche look like?

655
00:53:59,365 --> 00:54:00,354
He's ugly.

656
00:54:01,316 --> 00:54:01,975
What else?

657
00:54:02,053 --> 00:54:05,045
He's popular,
the rabble worships him.

658
00:54:05,316 --> 00:54:06,408
The rabble...

659
00:54:06,532 --> 00:54:08,727
The disease is spreading
and he's gaining more sympathizers.

660
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:10,765
He bribes them...

661
00:54:13,508 --> 00:54:15,408
Then, we must bribe to capture him.

662
00:54:15,908 --> 00:54:18,069
Put a price on his head.

663
00:54:41,092 --> 00:54:43,253
Look! These boots fit me.

664
00:54:43,332 --> 00:54:45,664
I should have gotten
the address of that customer.

665
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:48,512
I can even wiggle my toes.

666
00:54:55,812 --> 00:54:58,144
What did we buy today?
I mean, whom?

667
00:54:58,243 --> 00:55:00,905
A magistrate, and two lieutenants.

668
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:02,193
The Arsenal Commissary?

669
00:55:02,275 --> 00:55:04,243
There are some you can't bribe.

670
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:06,816
You're mistaken. Put the price up.

671
00:55:06,947 --> 00:55:09,040
He's young -
he can be of use for a long time.

672
00:55:09,091 --> 00:55:11,423
I've already given Capucine
1,000 pounds.

673
00:55:11,587 --> 00:55:12,576
For the poor.

674
00:55:14,947 --> 00:55:16,175
See how it works?

675
00:55:16,226 --> 00:55:20,706
When your luck's in, it's easy.
Show off, and ask no questions.

676
00:55:20,707 --> 00:55:23,039
Everyone gives you flowers.

677
00:55:23,298 --> 00:55:27,564
Until the day you get hay-fever,
and sneeze.

678
00:55:28,706 --> 00:55:31,585
Your fingers must flutter,
and your wrist keeps supple.

679
00:55:31,586 --> 00:55:33,349
The arms don't move.

680
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:34,719
Listen.

681
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,079
What is it for?

682
00:55:47,042 --> 00:55:48,168
Loving.

683
00:55:48,418 --> 00:55:50,113
He can do anything well.

684
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:51,526
That's true.

685
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:58,489
If my father had been a Cardinal,
I would play the harpsichord, too.

686
00:55:58,626 --> 00:55:59,991
Was your father a Cardinal?

687
00:56:03,682 --> 00:56:04,979
Mole, I envy you.

688
00:56:06,338 --> 00:56:08,033
What for?

689
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:10,785
Well, you talk well...

690
00:56:10,786 --> 00:56:13,186
...play like an Italian...
drink without slobbering...

691
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,528
That's what I call education...

692
00:56:15,874 --> 00:56:19,742
I envy you, Mole face...
Good health!

693
00:56:22,241 --> 00:56:24,004
Come and see how pretty it is.

694
00:56:40,577 --> 00:56:41,703
What else?

695
00:56:43,489 --> 00:56:44,478
Nothing.

696
00:56:44,577 --> 00:56:47,045
I can give you everything.
Anything you wish!

697
00:56:47,361 --> 00:56:48,350
It's true.

698
00:56:49,473 --> 00:56:50,997
It's no longer amusing.

699
00:56:53,696 --> 00:56:56,062
Enjoy life, Dominique...

700
00:56:57,121 --> 00:56:58,383
It wards off death.

701
00:57:03,873 --> 00:57:05,864
A carpet would look well there.

702
00:57:07,136 --> 00:57:08,501
And another chandelier?

703
00:57:10,112 --> 00:57:11,875
Two sconces here?

704
00:57:12,288 --> 00:57:16,122
Indian shawls... a lantern, and...

705
00:57:17,504 --> 00:57:20,598
...a painter, painting my portrait.

706
00:57:22,048 --> 00:57:22,844
A painter!

707
00:57:22,912 --> 00:57:24,573
Sure there is nothing missing?

708
00:57:26,144 --> 00:57:27,736
Yes, there is. You.

709
00:57:27,968 --> 00:57:31,131
You leave at dawn, return at dawn...
I never see you.

710
00:57:36,287 --> 00:57:39,120
I forgot... I'd like a talking bird.

711
00:57:39,648 --> 00:57:40,637
Gentle!

712
00:57:41,248 --> 00:57:42,237
Did you hear?

713
00:57:42,303 --> 00:57:43,292
My ears are large!

714
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:45,486
A real bird... not stuffed.

715
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:46,436
We'll buy it.

716
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,554
Are you mad? In broad daylight?

717
00:57:48,896 --> 00:57:50,591
I wish to show myself.

718
00:57:50,687 --> 00:57:53,178
Venus shall have her bird.

719
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,138
He's lovely.

720
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:03,356
Where's he from?

721
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:05,178
Golconde, Madame.

722
00:58:05,535 --> 00:58:06,297
Where's that?

723
00:58:06,336 --> 00:58:07,325
Away to the South.

724
00:58:08,383 --> 00:58:10,010
That is far too much!

725
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:10,945
Complaining?

726
00:58:11,007 --> 00:58:12,838
Thank you, my lord.

727
00:58:13,727 --> 00:58:15,888
Thank you, my lord.
Thank you, my lord.

728
00:58:17,567 --> 00:58:18,465
Do you hear him?

729
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,996
I paid enough.

730
00:58:21,951 --> 00:58:24,215
Say thank you, Dominique.

731
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:36,003
I'll come one day...

732
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:37,512
You always say that.

733
00:58:38,334 --> 00:58:40,199
Leave it be. See you soon.

734
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:43,345
Who was that?

735
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,838
What else do you want?

736
00:58:47,902 --> 00:58:49,233
To see you more faithful.

737
00:58:49,342 --> 00:58:50,866
It's very difficult, but I do try.

738
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:52,348
I do try...

739
00:59:10,846 --> 00:59:12,177
In the name of the King...

740
00:59:13,886 --> 00:59:15,046
Get them to be silent.

741
00:59:18,206 --> 00:59:19,366
In the King's name...

742
00:59:21,246 --> 00:59:23,900
A reward of 1,000 pounds
is offered...

743
00:59:23,901 --> 00:59:25,732
...for the capture of Cartouche.

744
00:59:28,093 --> 00:59:29,321
Medium height...

745
00:59:31,422 --> 00:59:32,411
...dark hair...

746
00:59:33,629 --> 00:59:34,527
...crooked nose...

747
00:59:35,677 --> 00:59:36,666
Crooked nose?

748
00:59:39,806 --> 00:59:41,637
How much for Cartouche?

749
00:59:42,013 --> 00:59:43,446
A thousand pounds.

750
00:59:53,469 --> 00:59:54,367
Here they are.

751
00:59:56,861 --> 00:59:57,919
You can have him!

752
01:00:06,941 --> 01:00:08,340
Coming to get me?

753
01:00:32,604 --> 01:00:34,765
If you are Cartouche,
let me kiss you.

754
01:00:34,876 --> 01:00:36,537
You avenge us, the poor.

755
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:39,927
Vengeance, that's all they talk about...

756
01:00:39,964 --> 01:00:41,795
...and they wonder
why they remain poor!

757
01:00:53,564 --> 01:00:56,863
Cartouche is right...
Kill the rich!

758
01:00:58,843 --> 01:01:00,834
How about my livelihood?

759
01:01:01,564 --> 01:01:02,553
Leave them alone.

760
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:06,306
Stop.

761
01:01:08,924 --> 01:01:11,188
Excuse them, Madame.
Nobody's fault.

762
01:01:11,195 --> 01:01:12,321
No, no. Don't thank me.

763
01:01:12,379 --> 01:01:13,346
Who is that?

764
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:14,802
I've already had the pleasure, Sir.

765
01:01:14,844 --> 01:01:15,572
Who is he?

766
01:01:15,643 --> 01:01:17,543
Come on, bow!

767
01:01:17,595 --> 01:01:18,584
Another word, and...

768
01:01:18,907 --> 01:01:19,896
What shall we do with him?

769
01:01:19,963 --> 01:01:21,624
Kill him!

770
01:01:21,724 --> 01:01:23,055
Silence!

771
01:01:23,515 --> 01:01:24,413
Silence.

772
01:01:25,243 --> 01:01:26,540
Bow to your Master.

773
01:01:32,315 --> 01:01:33,339
Stop it.

774
01:01:33,403 --> 01:01:34,392
I beg of you...

775
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:35,789
You let her beg for mercy?

776
01:01:35,835 --> 01:01:37,826
- But...
- No "buts." You're free.

777
01:01:39,067 --> 01:01:42,195
He owes you his life -
a woman's finest present.

778
01:01:45,082 --> 01:01:46,515
Give way, there.

779
01:01:46,683 --> 01:01:48,173
That woman is a saint.

780
01:01:48,762 --> 01:01:52,425
I'll sleep with her tonight -
I wish to know all about her.

781
01:02:12,858 --> 01:02:14,223
I am ashamed.

782
01:02:14,682 --> 01:02:15,842
Why did you bow?

783
01:02:16,442 --> 01:02:18,273
Life is worth the drop of a hat.

784
01:02:18,362 --> 01:02:20,193
You either bow, or are bowed to.

785
01:02:20,538 --> 01:02:22,369
Don't be surprised at what happens.

786
01:02:22,809 --> 01:02:24,333
What would you have done?

787
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:27,634
I would not have given in.

788
01:02:43,002 --> 01:02:43,900
To the Chatelet.

789
01:03:11,257 --> 01:03:13,748
Madame, now we'd like a story.

790
01:03:20,568 --> 01:03:21,762
Long live Cartouche.

791
01:03:23,161 --> 01:03:25,152
Let's drink, Dominique.

792
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:42,561
Why do they say
only the honest are happy?

793
01:03:42,744 --> 01:03:43,904
It does happen.

794
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,790
What about us, then?

795
01:03:45,848 --> 01:03:47,110
We must be honest.

796
01:03:51,864 --> 01:03:54,856
Pardon me, Venus,
this is for men only...

797
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,891
- Her name?
- Isabelle...

798
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,732
She runs a school... for girls...

799
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:11,702
Youth, beauty, elegance...

800
01:04:11,703 --> 01:04:12,431
And her?

801
01:04:12,503 --> 01:04:14,835
A stone's throw away...

802
01:04:15,287 --> 01:04:16,185
But Isabelle?

803
01:04:16,247 --> 01:04:20,183
About thirty of them...
Angels... flowers...

804
01:04:20,216 --> 01:04:20,944
I'm going.

805
01:04:21,303 --> 01:04:22,031
Alone?

806
01:04:22,584 --> 01:04:23,710
Fall in!

807
01:04:24,024 --> 01:04:25,355
Take the handsome ones.

808
01:04:25,913 --> 01:04:27,346
You, you, you...

809
01:04:27,386 --> 01:04:28,045
Say "ha"...

810
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:30,108
You smell. Out.

811
01:04:30,235 --> 01:04:31,395
I need you.

812
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:32,281
Where to?

813
01:04:32,348 --> 01:04:33,679
To answer a maiden's prayer.

814
01:04:33,725 --> 01:04:35,090
Gentle, put your fork down.

815
01:04:35,133 --> 01:04:36,361
Louison, you stay here.

816
01:04:52,869 --> 01:04:53,767
Good day, Sister.

817
01:04:53,829 --> 01:04:54,727
Come in, Father.

818
01:05:03,144 --> 01:05:04,736
Not before I signal.

819
01:05:20,048 --> 01:05:21,106
Fear not.

820
01:05:21,905 --> 01:05:22,803
A man!

821
01:05:23,506 --> 01:05:24,666
They've never seen one?

822
01:05:26,387 --> 01:05:27,479
I'm not alone.

823
01:05:35,959 --> 01:05:38,325
Take your choice, ladies.

824
01:05:38,712 --> 01:05:39,701
All handsome!

825
01:05:41,177 --> 01:05:42,166
Which do you want?

826
01:05:42,618 --> 01:05:43,710
Who wants this one?

827
01:05:45,051 --> 01:05:45,949
And this one?

828
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:48,352
You monster!

829
01:05:48,796 --> 01:05:50,127
Go to your rooms.

830
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:51,873
I had the same idea.

831
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:54,650
You there, which will you have?

832
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:57,248
Has Madame scared you?

833
01:05:59,361 --> 01:06:00,760
Take the one who picked you.

834
01:06:01,058 --> 01:06:02,184
He's strong.

835
01:06:02,242 --> 01:06:03,140
That's enough.

836
01:06:03,202 --> 01:06:04,760
Leave them, I choose you.

837
01:06:04,804 --> 01:06:06,203
Please... for their sakes.

838
01:06:06,244 --> 01:06:07,677
It's good for them.

839
01:06:07,717 --> 01:06:08,843
They'll hurt them.

840
01:06:08,902 --> 01:06:10,631
No real harm. Come.

841
01:06:14,248 --> 01:06:15,738
They smell of lemons.

842
01:06:17,257 --> 01:06:17,916
Go.

843
01:06:18,313 --> 01:06:19,439
I'd cut a sorry figure.

844
01:06:19,754 --> 01:06:20,948
I beg of you, go.

845
01:06:21,002 --> 01:06:21,991
In exchange?

846
01:06:23,019 --> 01:06:23,917
A kiss?

847
01:06:25,452 --> 01:06:26,817
Your hand to kiss?

848
01:06:39,858 --> 01:06:40,916
Keep away.

849
01:06:41,587 --> 01:06:42,485
Wait outside.

850
01:06:42,516 --> 01:06:43,505
Leaving?

851
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:44,689
Lmmediately.

852
01:06:45,845 --> 01:06:48,609
The girls will regret it.

853
01:06:50,199 --> 01:06:53,600
Flowers wilt, without air.

854
01:07:14,433 --> 01:07:16,833
I've got to have her.

855
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:17,855
You had her.

856
01:07:17,955 --> 01:07:20,387
She'd have fallen for me...
Her eyes...

857
01:07:20,388 --> 01:07:21,855
Two eyes, like everybody.

858
01:07:22,373 --> 01:07:23,840
- I'm disappointed.
- What happened?

859
01:07:23,846 --> 01:07:24,835
He chose us.

860
01:07:25,254 --> 01:07:26,846
- You first!
- Him first!

861
01:07:26,887 --> 01:07:30,254
For pleasure, danger, or work,
I'm always first.

862
01:07:33,129 --> 01:07:34,892
What's Venus going to say?

863
01:07:35,402 --> 01:07:37,867
A nice crowd!
With only one thing on your mind...

864
01:07:37,868 --> 01:07:38,596
You pigs!

865
01:07:39,148 --> 01:07:40,137
That's what you are!

866
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:43,373
Calm down, Venus,
nothing happened.

867
01:07:43,406 --> 01:07:44,896
Nothing at all.

868
01:07:44,943 --> 01:07:45,739
Nothing.

869
01:07:48,528 --> 01:07:49,859
You reek of women.

870
01:07:49,969 --> 01:07:52,130
Something could've happened,
but he wouldn't.

871
01:07:52,177 --> 01:07:53,701
Can't think why...

872
01:07:54,258 --> 01:07:57,955
Dominique, what's come over you?

873
01:07:58,133 --> 01:08:00,533
This morning, you saved that louse.

874
01:08:00,533 --> 01:08:01,864
With that huge ring!

875
01:08:01,942 --> 01:08:03,466
Now it's his wife...

876
01:08:04,215 --> 01:08:06,376
A "show-off" covered with jewels.

877
01:08:08,056 --> 01:08:09,045
So you like her.

878
01:08:09,593 --> 01:08:10,992
No, Venus, no.

879
01:08:11,033 --> 01:08:13,593
Hands off.
I'm not just for anyone.

880
01:08:13,979 --> 01:08:15,310
Lucky man.

881
01:08:16,637 --> 01:08:17,604
My little Venus.

882
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:20,938
My little jealous one.

883
01:08:22,462 --> 01:08:23,360
More words...

884
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:24,797
Words words...

885
01:08:25,344 --> 01:08:26,834
I wasn't spoken to like that.

886
01:08:27,297 --> 01:08:28,286
You see...

887
01:08:28,866 --> 01:08:30,026
A question of time...

888
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:32,297
That's enough talk...

889
01:08:32,643 --> 01:08:35,203
What do we go for, tonight?

890
01:08:35,685 --> 01:08:38,483
The cattle enclosure,
or the Opera safe?

891
01:08:40,391 --> 01:08:41,380
I don't care.

892
01:08:42,695 --> 01:08:43,855
I want you to care.

893
01:08:46,473 --> 01:08:47,963
This evening's for Venus.

894
01:08:51,116 --> 01:08:52,447
We'll go to the country.

895
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:54,889
Alone?

896
01:08:55,597 --> 01:08:56,586
That's right.

897
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,390
Wonder if he knows his own mind?

898
01:09:10,708 --> 01:09:11,697
What are you up to?

899
01:09:13,205 --> 01:09:14,536
Heads or tails?

900
01:09:14,966 --> 01:09:15,955
The world's fate?

901
01:09:16,374 --> 01:09:19,901
Everything always
depends on money.

902
01:09:20,183 --> 01:09:22,913
Yes or No. Black or white.
Heads or Tails.

903
01:09:27,419 --> 01:09:29,819
Malichot's doing a lot of thinking...

904
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:37,989
To think that Cartouche
attacked my wife!

905
01:09:38,176 --> 01:09:41,509
The wife of a Lieutenant General!

906
01:09:41,537 --> 01:09:42,629
You mean he dared?

907
01:09:42,914 --> 01:09:43,642
My wife...

908
01:09:45,539 --> 01:09:48,303
And none of you knew about it.

909
01:09:49,828 --> 01:09:50,817
Magnificent.

910
01:09:51,749 --> 01:09:55,742
The time has come to stop dreaming
and see reality. Make people talk!

911
01:09:56,039 --> 01:09:57,700
Do you have to be taught?
Excuse me.

912
01:10:00,841 --> 01:10:02,365
Your Excellency...

913
01:10:02,474 --> 01:10:03,202
And this?

914
01:10:04,714 --> 01:10:06,306
I had to get him myself.

915
01:10:06,347 --> 01:10:08,338
I came of my own free will.

916
01:10:08,589 --> 01:10:09,578
It's Malichot...

917
01:10:09,677 --> 01:10:12,669
Yes, it's Malichot.
Cartouche took his place.

918
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:13,740
Why?

919
01:10:14,095 --> 01:10:18,930
I'm very fond of you and my father
was fond of your father, but...

920
01:10:19,474 --> 01:10:21,465
...please tell these gentlemen...

921
01:10:21,586 --> 01:10:24,054
Cartouche has gone
to the country, alone.

922
01:10:24,756 --> 01:10:27,589
More than alone, with a woman.

923
01:10:28,918 --> 01:10:32,081
With fifteen men, I can capture him.

924
01:10:32,439 --> 01:10:34,373
I'm going, I'm gone, I'm there...

925
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,330
And the gang?

926
01:10:36,729 --> 01:10:38,060
The gang's mine.

927
01:10:39,642 --> 01:10:44,306
I am a man of honor.
I shall keep to our pact.

928
01:10:44,444 --> 01:10:45,638
The meeting place?

929
01:10:45,724 --> 01:10:46,713
My place.

930
01:10:46,781 --> 01:10:48,112
I'm not afraid of them.

931
01:10:48,286 --> 01:10:52,780
And Malichot never caused us
any serious trouble.

932
01:10:53,088 --> 01:10:55,454
- I want Cartouche!
- You'll have him!

933
01:11:12,488 --> 01:11:15,286
When you are very rich,
even richer than now...

934
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:16,928
...hay will be the same price.

935
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:19,677
What more do you need
to be happy?

936
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:21,358
Dreaming?

937
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:22,318
Of you.

938
01:11:25,582 --> 01:11:26,514
That woman.

939
01:11:26,862 --> 01:11:28,955
I'm not enough for you?

940
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:30,325
I wonder...

941
01:11:31,985 --> 01:11:33,976
Why do we have to think
about other women...

942
01:11:34,386 --> 01:11:35,876
...to be faithful to one?

943
01:11:35,986 --> 01:11:38,250
If I got hold of that
Ferrusac woman...

944
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:41,138
Same here!

945
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:46,596
I'd caught a fish...

946
01:11:50,457 --> 01:11:53,187
Watch your rod, Venus.
Always kissing.

947
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:55,354
I'm hungry.

948
01:11:56,539 --> 01:11:59,531
How about an omelet,
made the way you like it?

949
01:12:06,015 --> 01:12:07,573
You said we'd do a tour.

950
01:12:07,616 --> 01:12:08,514
Tomorrow.

951
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:12,936
Meanwhile,
we've missed the mail-coach.

952
01:12:13,763 --> 01:12:17,987
A mail-coach full of fat clergymen
covered with rings.

953
01:12:17,988 --> 01:12:20,149
Don't make fun of religion.

954
01:12:20,165 --> 01:12:22,156
She's right -
you must have principles.

955
01:12:22,182 --> 01:12:23,171
I have.

956
01:12:23,687 --> 01:12:24,676
Well, show them.

957
01:12:25,063 --> 01:12:26,052
They're yours.

958
01:12:27,784 --> 01:12:29,183
Live fast and well.

959
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:32,813
I don't want to work all day.

960
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:36,423
What would be the use of living?

961
01:12:36,653 --> 01:12:39,247
No so fast. Maybe they are right.

962
01:12:41,807 --> 01:12:42,796
Listen...

963
01:12:48,818 --> 01:12:50,479
You can do what you like in life...

964
01:12:51,219 --> 01:12:52,880
...except pass judgment.

965
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:54,769
That's a sin.

966
01:12:57,045 --> 01:12:58,034
Listen.

967
01:12:59,446 --> 01:13:00,435
I heard.

968
01:13:00,567 --> 01:13:02,899
It's only the frogs in the bulrushes.

969
01:13:21,952 --> 01:13:23,852
Somebody's there.

970
01:13:27,715 --> 01:13:31,779
I'll take the horses and cross the river.
We meet on the other side.

971
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:33,543
No. I'll go. You two run.

972
01:13:37,734 --> 01:13:38,632
He's all right.

973
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:44,077
- He's up there!
- Go for him!

974
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:21,382
If Louison gets hurt,
I'll roast them alive.

975
01:14:22,778 --> 01:14:25,818
Venus, you shall give me a son.

976
01:14:25,819 --> 01:14:26,979
Not just now.

977
01:14:28,028 --> 01:14:29,154
I'll call him Louison.

978
01:14:38,497 --> 01:14:40,124
Look after Venus.

979
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:56,905
He's making for the hideout.
Never mind. I give it all to you.

980
01:14:56,905 --> 01:14:59,703
The hide-out, the gang...
We must get there before him.

981
01:15:03,436 --> 01:15:04,630
I'm not hungry.

982
01:15:05,036 --> 01:15:06,025
Impossible!

983
01:15:06,125 --> 01:15:10,318
Where's Malichot?
He's up to no good, I can scent it.

984
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:11,217
Scent it?

985
01:15:11,759 --> 01:15:15,160
Seen my nose? I use it!

986
01:15:16,242 --> 01:15:17,800
Something stinks.

987
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:19,757
You're exaggerating.

988
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:22,745
I worry about Dominique, see?

989
01:15:22,804 --> 01:15:23,964
That's friendship.

990
01:15:24,277 --> 01:15:27,678
Same here, but I show it less.

991
01:15:31,192 --> 01:15:32,784
You think he's been pinched?

992
01:15:33,369 --> 01:15:35,735
Not pinched. Tracked.

993
01:15:39,292 --> 01:15:43,626
The sort of night I love, pitch black.

994
01:16:05,702 --> 01:16:07,033
Not a sound...

995
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:09,594
Surround the house.

996
01:16:30,033 --> 01:16:32,126
Each man for himself.
We're surrounded.

997
01:16:32,146 --> 01:16:34,114
Run. Take the tunnel.

998
01:16:34,835 --> 01:16:36,097
Take only the weapons.

999
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,571
Where are the Mole and Gentle?

1000
01:16:46,232 --> 01:16:48,200
The weapons only! Hurry up!

1001
01:16:49,209 --> 01:16:50,403
To the tunnel!

1002
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,556
Close the trap-doors.

1003
01:17:05,408 --> 01:17:06,136
Too late...

1004
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:11,520
The chimney...

1005
01:17:11,587 --> 01:17:12,349
I'll delay them.

1006
01:17:13,059 --> 01:17:14,048
No time to argue.

1007
01:17:26,121 --> 01:17:27,281
I've eaten too much.

1008
01:18:19,488 --> 01:18:20,750
We've got him.

1009
01:18:20,961 --> 01:18:21,950
Cartouche!

1010
01:18:22,402 --> 01:18:23,391
Not yet!

1011
01:18:23,618 --> 01:18:24,516
I'll explain...

1012
01:18:24,579 --> 01:18:26,444
Quiet. In a moment.

1013
01:18:26,467 --> 01:18:27,798
I can't talk...

1014
01:18:34,727 --> 01:18:36,024
Where's Cartouche?

1015
01:18:36,296 --> 01:18:37,786
With your wife.

1016
01:18:38,889 --> 01:18:39,878
Let him have it.

1017
01:18:53,135 --> 01:18:54,124
The others?

1018
01:18:56,176 --> 01:18:58,508
With your wife,
along with Cartouche!

1019
01:18:58,865 --> 01:19:00,560
She's a whore.

1020
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:04,849
Pour...

1021
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:22,152
Dominique Cartouche, get to safety...

1022
01:19:50,696 --> 01:19:51,685
Be clearer...

1023
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:55,432
That's all very well,
but it won't save Gentle.

1024
01:19:55,433 --> 01:19:56,559
Gently does it...

1025
01:19:56,618 --> 01:19:58,176
Come on... talk.

1026
01:19:58,187 --> 01:20:01,122
It's Ferrussac. It's Ferrussac.

1027
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:02,561
You don't say!

1028
01:20:02,989 --> 01:20:04,650
Mole, get pen and paper...

1029
01:20:04,654 --> 01:20:07,054
As you're so friendly, offer him this...

1030
01:20:07,054 --> 01:20:08,715
Take this letter to Ferrussac.

1031
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:10,093
Write this:

1032
01:20:11,248 --> 01:20:13,182
"I am availing myself, Sir..."

1033
01:20:13,489 --> 01:20:14,456
Pour!

1034
01:20:14,738 --> 01:20:16,933
"I am availing myself, Sir..."

1035
01:20:17,459 --> 01:20:21,190
"...of your servant Malichot,
bearer of this message...

1036
01:20:21,204 --> 01:20:24,053
"...to offer you my terms."

1037
01:20:24,054 --> 01:20:25,521
Send that carrion back?!

1038
01:20:25,558 --> 01:20:29,751
"In exchange for the freedom
of my friend, I offer you...

1039
01:20:29,752 --> 01:20:32,601
"...three stewards, of wine,
corn and salt..."

1040
01:20:32,602 --> 01:20:33,569
Not so fast!

1041
01:20:33,626 --> 01:20:36,959
"...4 magistrates, 12 sergeants...
Otherwise..."

1042
01:20:37,116 --> 01:20:37,775
Otherwise?

1043
01:20:41,822 --> 01:20:42,811
Stop!

1044
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:46,399
Nothing.

1045
01:20:48,289 --> 01:20:49,017
What did he say?

1046
01:20:49,217 --> 01:20:50,206
I can't make it out.

1047
01:20:53,187 --> 01:20:55,587
My Lord... My good master...

1048
01:20:55,587 --> 01:20:57,248
Here comes the half-wit...

1049
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:00,601
Do I pay you to crawl?
Look what you got us...

1050
01:21:01,638 --> 01:21:02,935
A brute who won't talk.

1051
01:21:03,271 --> 01:21:05,262
I've got news...

1052
01:21:05,768 --> 01:21:06,666
Is that so?

1053
01:21:08,233 --> 01:21:08,995
Look.

1054
01:21:18,221 --> 01:21:19,449
Give him some more.

1055
01:21:20,558 --> 01:21:22,219
Good news...

1056
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:24,909
Did you read this?

1057
01:21:25,489 --> 01:21:28,014
Cartouche read it aloud.

1058
01:21:29,682 --> 01:21:31,707
And you know the names?

1059
01:21:31,764 --> 01:21:36,212
Some of them... Bamont...

1060
01:21:36,213 --> 01:21:38,965
...Monsieur d'Outreville,
Monsieur de...

1061
01:21:38,966 --> 01:21:39,955
Stop!

1062
01:21:44,089 --> 01:21:45,317
You'll get your reward.

1063
01:21:45,369 --> 01:21:46,097
Thank you.

1064
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:46,898
Stop.

1065
01:21:53,949 --> 01:21:55,541
What's the matter?

1066
01:21:56,414 --> 01:22:01,249
Monsieur de Ferrusac!
Monsieur le Comte, Excellency!

1067
01:22:01,376 --> 01:22:02,274
Help!

1068
01:22:47,316 --> 01:22:50,132
By order of the King,
the High Executioner...

1069
01:22:50,133 --> 01:22:53,660
...will perform his duties
on one Gentle.

1070
01:22:54,262 --> 01:22:55,661
Who's he?

1071
01:23:01,722 --> 01:23:04,282
They say he's a fine looking man.

1072
01:23:04,315 --> 01:23:06,779
If they hanged my man,
I'd burn a candle for St. Anthony.

1073
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:09,840
Cheer up.
They don't hang just anybody.

1074
01:23:11,966 --> 01:23:13,627
Down with Cartouche!

1075
01:23:30,054 --> 01:23:31,043
Well, Isabelle?

1076
01:23:31,174 --> 01:23:34,337
Praying, my dear.
I've married a saint.

1077
01:23:34,728 --> 01:23:35,717
Long live Cartouche!

1078
01:23:44,397 --> 01:23:45,728
He's Cartouche's lieutenant.

1079
01:23:56,305 --> 01:23:58,296
Calm down!

1080
01:24:10,424 --> 01:24:13,359
Won't be long now, my beauties.

1081
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,236
Bravo, little one!

1082
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:58,451
Thank you, all of you...

1083
01:25:06,896 --> 01:25:07,885
What next?

1084
01:25:32,507 --> 01:25:34,668
He's up in the sky now...

1085
01:25:35,805 --> 01:25:37,724
They're in league with the devil...

1086
01:25:37,725 --> 01:25:38,749
No, Pierrette.

1087
01:25:39,838 --> 01:25:43,205
You were the first to call
for their punishment, before...

1088
01:25:44,128 --> 01:25:45,117
Before what?

1089
01:25:45,536 --> 01:25:46,764
I know what I mean...

1090
01:25:47,586 --> 01:25:48,985
Bandits...

1091
01:25:51,235 --> 01:25:53,897
Maybe sent by Heaven
to chastise us.

1092
01:25:54,757 --> 01:25:57,419
If we had to rely on Heaven
to rid us of them...

1093
01:25:57,574 --> 01:25:59,166
Blasphemy!

1094
01:25:59,622 --> 01:26:00,748
Leave me...

1095
01:26:20,688 --> 01:26:21,985
Fear nothing, Madame.

1096
01:26:22,705 --> 01:26:23,933
I've not come to take...

1097
01:26:24,593 --> 01:26:25,491
...but to give.

1098
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:28,601
Don't ring. My men would come.

1099
01:26:29,011 --> 01:26:32,242
Ask for anything you wish for...
I am all yours.

1100
01:26:32,436 --> 01:26:34,768
This town is mine,
you can have it...

1101
01:26:34,934 --> 01:26:38,199
...with its trees,
its churches and avenues.

1102
01:26:38,199 --> 01:26:41,930
Tonight the bell-ringers
await my orders.

1103
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:43,478
Your orders!

1104
01:27:08,869 --> 01:27:11,030
Do you expect me to thank you?

1105
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:13,411
You may. I'd love it.

1106
01:27:13,894 --> 01:27:15,293
It's only the beginning.

1107
01:27:15,432 --> 01:27:17,992
The Grand Turk's Ambassador...

1108
01:27:17,992 --> 01:27:20,968
...bringing diamonds to the king...

1109
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:22,834
They made me dream of you.

1110
01:27:23,467 --> 01:27:25,367
The king will never have them...

1111
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:27,013
...but you will.

1112
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,489
How?

1113
01:27:29,838 --> 01:27:32,136
A crime... you are a criminal!

1114
01:27:33,038 --> 01:27:35,131
To give you
what comes to my hands...

1115
01:27:35,536 --> 01:27:36,935
...everything that's beautiful...

1116
01:27:38,161 --> 01:27:40,152
You haunt me all the time...

1117
01:27:40,946 --> 01:27:42,777
I'm convinced you know it.

1118
01:27:45,204 --> 01:27:47,195
How right I was to come here!

1119
01:27:48,246 --> 01:27:49,770
To think that I hesitated.

1120
01:27:50,486 --> 01:27:51,817
You hesitated?

1121
01:27:53,048 --> 01:27:54,037
Not long.

1122
01:28:05,885 --> 01:28:07,045
All the same, eh?

1123
01:28:07,101 --> 01:28:11,003
Hesitations and vapors,
fear and trembling...

1124
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:15,018
Forgive me...

1125
01:28:15,777 --> 01:28:18,109
But I know what I want...

1126
01:28:18,979 --> 01:28:20,810
...and how to obtain it.

1127
01:28:21,059 --> 01:28:23,220
You are strong... with a pistol!

1128
01:28:23,717 --> 01:28:24,877
It frightens you?

1129
01:28:26,278 --> 01:28:27,267
You can have it.

1130
01:28:28,903 --> 01:28:29,892
I'd like to kill you!

1131
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:30,851
Go ahead.

1132
01:28:33,065 --> 01:28:33,793
Shoot!

1133
01:28:34,825 --> 01:28:35,553
Shoot!

1134
01:28:35,850 --> 01:28:37,317
No. Are you mad?

1135
01:28:37,611 --> 01:28:38,805
Try daring for once.

1136
01:28:41,165 --> 01:28:43,065
She dared! Marvelous!

1137
01:28:44,750 --> 01:28:45,648
What have you done?

1138
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:48,042
How could you think it was loaded?

1139
01:28:48,111 --> 01:28:49,772
I respect life.

1140
01:28:50,032 --> 01:28:52,830
The wretch... Coward, coward...

1141
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:57,354
I never thought
I'd make a criminal of you.

1142
01:28:59,956 --> 01:29:01,355
Now we've got a bond.

1143
01:29:03,158 --> 01:29:07,322
Now rest. The king himself
shall celebrate our engagement.

1144
01:29:08,215 --> 01:29:09,978
I'll give you diamonds...

1145
01:29:49,642 --> 01:29:52,372
The Ambassador
of the Grand Turk!

1146
01:29:59,982 --> 01:30:00,971
Let's welcome him!

1147
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:24,247
May their aging leader
govern his son's youthful years.

1148
01:30:24,248 --> 01:30:26,045
Bringing the people...

1149
01:30:26,106 --> 01:30:30,065
...happiness brought about
by the state harmony.

1150
01:30:31,323 --> 01:30:32,312
Shall I stop?

1151
01:30:34,877 --> 01:30:37,209
You were not listening.

1152
01:30:38,111 --> 01:30:39,339
Of course I was.

1153
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:42,771
Son of Saturn...

1154
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:08,959
You saw?

1155
01:31:11,693 --> 01:31:13,092
Yes, my dear, I did.

1156
01:31:13,133 --> 01:31:14,157
Scandalous.

1157
01:31:14,542 --> 01:31:16,533
The remains of the Grand Turk...
In my courtyard...

1158
01:31:17,423 --> 01:31:18,913
It's a provocation...

1159
01:31:19,537 --> 01:31:21,528
He's stronger than you are.

1160
01:31:21,554 --> 01:31:22,782
It seems to amuse you...

1161
01:31:23,218 --> 01:31:24,480
I think it does.

1162
01:31:24,531 --> 01:31:27,987
Why is he after me?

1163
01:31:27,988 --> 01:31:29,979
I'd say it was me he was after.

1164
01:31:32,502 --> 01:31:33,662
What's this nonsense?

1165
01:31:33,975 --> 01:31:37,536
Nonsense?
He came to my very room.

1166
01:31:38,648 --> 01:31:40,343
Madame is very upset.

1167
01:31:40,377 --> 01:31:41,366
Upset!

1168
01:31:41,434 --> 01:31:42,799
I nearly killed him.

1169
01:31:42,906 --> 01:31:43,565
Killed him?

1170
01:31:44,763 --> 01:31:46,993
Don't be silly, you annoy me.

1171
01:31:47,356 --> 01:31:48,687
And you never said a word?

1172
01:31:50,910 --> 01:31:52,901
What if I said I liked him?

1173
01:31:53,759 --> 01:31:54,691
What?

1174
01:31:55,168 --> 01:31:55,896
Nothing.

1175
01:32:06,116 --> 01:32:07,447
I can understand Madame.

1176
01:32:07,493 --> 01:32:11,224
That man can fascinate women.

1177
01:32:14,376 --> 01:32:16,037
Has he fascinated my wife?

1178
01:32:17,641 --> 01:32:19,131
There may be a chance.

1179
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:47,915
What's come over you?

1180
01:32:47,958 --> 01:32:49,289
The loot's at Ferrussac's.

1181
01:32:49,335 --> 01:32:50,324
Dominique, answer.

1182
01:32:51,064 --> 01:32:53,328
Living with diamonds,
underground...

1183
01:32:53,337 --> 01:32:54,998
The gang's complaining...

1184
01:32:55,258 --> 01:32:57,419
Don't you care
for raiding any more?

1185
01:32:58,075 --> 01:32:59,133
You let us down.

1186
01:33:01,148 --> 01:33:02,740
He's in love.

1187
01:33:03,773 --> 01:33:04,899
Give me the diamonds.

1188
01:33:05,182 --> 01:33:06,672
Anything but those.

1189
01:33:06,814 --> 01:33:07,542
Why?

1190
01:33:07,807 --> 01:33:09,638
You'll understand
when you're a man.

1191
01:33:09,664 --> 01:33:13,120
So it's a woman you're after, now?
Eh, Dominique?

1192
01:33:13,121 --> 01:33:14,110
Answer us.

1193
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:15,359
It's my business.

1194
01:33:21,797 --> 01:33:23,264
You'll end up alone.

1195
01:33:23,462 --> 01:33:24,827
We'll leave you.

1196
01:33:25,414 --> 01:33:28,713
Dust to dust, as the saying goes.

1197
01:33:31,241 --> 01:33:32,230
I have discovered...

1198
01:33:33,322 --> 01:33:34,220
Follow me.

1199
01:34:15,933 --> 01:34:16,922
What do you want?

1200
01:34:17,053 --> 01:34:20,216
You. And your soul. I'm in love.

1201
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:22,967
Oh God...

1202
01:34:23,936 --> 01:34:26,700
And the devil.
It's all the same thing.

1203
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:31,602
I was never taught how to pray...

1204
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:35,613
If I want a thing, I take it.
If I give, I want my gift accepted.

1205
01:34:35,909 --> 01:34:37,433
I don't want those diamonds.

1206
01:34:38,598 --> 01:34:40,725
What do you want? My life?

1207
01:34:41,127 --> 01:34:42,890
If you want my life, take it.

1208
01:34:43,785 --> 01:34:45,275
I can't give more.

1209
01:34:45,801 --> 01:34:46,859
It's no use to me.

1210
01:34:47,754 --> 01:34:52,054
That's a lie.
I have all that you lack.

1211
01:34:53,868 --> 01:34:55,529
And an army to observe us.

1212
01:34:58,607 --> 01:35:02,008
Tonight, I shall be alone
on the road to Monval.

1213
01:35:02,193 --> 01:35:05,026
After the crossroads, near the mill.

1214
01:35:05,298 --> 01:35:06,196
I shall wait...

1215
01:35:09,235 --> 01:35:12,898
You can come there, or betray me.

1216
01:35:13,077 --> 01:35:14,066
You are mad.

1217
01:35:14,518 --> 01:35:15,507
See you later.

1218
01:35:19,256 --> 01:35:20,245
I shall not come.

1219
01:35:33,630 --> 01:35:36,258
You're too ambitious.
That woman's not your sort.

1220
01:35:36,287 --> 01:35:37,879
Not at all...

1221
01:35:37,888 --> 01:35:39,378
He knows what suits him.

1222
01:35:39,905 --> 01:35:42,305
No one does, with women.

1223
01:35:42,850 --> 01:35:44,181
Except with experience.

1224
01:35:44,226 --> 01:35:45,557
You'll find out, son.

1225
01:35:47,139 --> 01:35:49,073
We'll guard...

1226
01:35:49,413 --> 01:35:50,141
...just in case.

1227
01:35:50,277 --> 01:35:51,608
No. I must be alone.

1228
01:35:52,550 --> 01:35:54,017
What do we tell Venus?

1229
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:55,780
I love her.

1230
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:58,432
Then why Isabelle?

1231
01:35:59,113 --> 01:36:01,877
Once you start...
you've got to go on.

1232
01:36:03,595 --> 01:36:04,755
Look after Louison.

1233
01:36:05,964 --> 01:36:08,023
Be tough, lad. I'm backing you.

1234
01:37:16,138 --> 01:37:20,507
Do you think he'd risk going alone?

1235
01:37:21,101 --> 01:37:22,193
Who, Madame?

1236
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:25,347
You know who.
He's waiting for me.

1237
01:37:25,647 --> 01:37:26,636
What do you care?

1238
01:37:27,215 --> 01:37:28,546
Suppose I went...

1239
01:37:30,096 --> 01:37:31,927
Your guests are waiting.

1240
01:37:52,730 --> 01:37:53,719
Gently.

1241
01:38:08,001 --> 01:38:08,990
You idiots!

1242
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:17,638
Let's go!

1243
01:38:51,411 --> 01:38:55,313
Good news, my friends.
Cartouche has been caught.

1244
01:38:57,238 --> 01:38:58,762
He is in prison by now.

1245
01:39:03,801 --> 01:39:05,666
Isabelle... at last.

1246
01:39:06,105 --> 01:39:08,266
Good evening.
Do you know the news?

1247
01:39:08,282 --> 01:39:10,045
Cartouche is caught.
They'll hang him.

1248
01:39:10,075 --> 01:39:11,906
The sooner the better.

1249
01:39:12,605 --> 01:39:13,572
Cartouche arrested?

1250
01:39:13,628 --> 01:39:16,062
Thanks to you. He was alone.

1251
01:39:16,222 --> 01:39:18,850
Who told you?

1252
01:39:18,879 --> 01:39:21,848
Cartouche amused me.

1253
01:39:22,688 --> 01:39:23,950
Dance, my friends.

1254
01:39:30,052 --> 01:39:31,041
Let us dance.

1255
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:33,271
Let me take my leave.

1256
01:39:33,478 --> 01:39:34,467
If you please...

1257
01:39:35,750 --> 01:39:36,808
If you please...

1258
01:39:51,982 --> 01:39:54,212
Dance, Isabelle, dance...

1259
01:39:54,926 --> 01:39:56,450
If it pleases you...

1260
01:40:01,938 --> 01:40:03,371
What's the matter?

1261
01:40:05,811 --> 01:40:08,644
My husband wishes me to dance.

1262
01:40:50,246 --> 01:40:51,144
Too late.

1263
01:40:51,303 --> 01:40:52,292
Why too late?

1264
01:40:52,519 --> 01:40:54,783
There's a whole army.

1265
01:40:54,825 --> 01:40:57,419
- What do we do?
- Die, or go?

1266
01:40:57,450 --> 01:40:58,439
I'm leaving.

1267
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:04,627
We have enough to live on
for centuries.

1268
01:41:05,197 --> 01:41:07,392
Do we lose the lot for a woman?

1269
01:41:07,854 --> 01:41:09,151
Follow me.

1270
01:41:09,231 --> 01:41:11,222
No, I'm leaving. Follow me.

1271
01:41:11,407 --> 01:41:12,305
Gentle!

1272
01:41:12,592 --> 01:41:14,116
I can't stand your fat...

1273
01:41:14,449 --> 01:41:15,347
...your beard...

1274
01:41:15,634 --> 01:41:16,566
...your stink...

1275
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:18,296
...your girlish ways...

1276
01:41:19,443 --> 01:41:21,070
Cartouche is a man.

1277
01:41:21,204 --> 01:41:23,331
That's why he dropped you.

1278
01:41:23,477 --> 01:41:24,466
It was his right.

1279
01:41:24,533 --> 01:41:26,228
He got pinched for a woman.

1280
01:41:26,326 --> 01:41:27,918
You are here to obey.

1281
01:41:27,959 --> 01:41:31,986
The rest concerns me alone.
I'm his wife. You'll see.

1282
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:34,374
Do as I tell you. Ready?

1283
01:41:35,226 --> 01:41:37,126
To obey you? Yes.

1284
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:00,828
Let's go.

1285
01:42:01,381 --> 01:42:02,939
Leave this to me.

1286
01:42:06,344 --> 01:42:07,333
Venus...

1287
01:42:25,167 --> 01:42:26,259
What's that girl up to?

1288
01:42:32,946 --> 01:42:34,277
Who is that poor man?

1289
01:42:34,708 --> 01:42:35,970
May I give him a drink?

1290
01:42:56,701 --> 01:42:57,690
Take this, and aim.

1291
01:43:33,869 --> 01:43:34,893
Run, Venus, run!

1292
01:44:24,035 --> 01:44:27,266
Get her - at all cost.

1293
01:44:33,543 --> 01:44:34,441
Venus...

1294
01:45:23,804 --> 01:45:25,999
Escape, Dominique...

1295
01:47:27,634 --> 01:47:29,625
She will have time enough
to wear them.

1296
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:04,272
The nights are getting chilly.

1297
01:50:06,103 --> 01:50:07,092
What now?

1298
01:50:09,688 --> 01:50:11,952
- I'll make them dance.
- And after?

1299
01:50:13,305 --> 01:50:14,636
The end's clear.
