3
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,682
There are many reasons
to celebrate.

4
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,044
Many occasions.

5
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:31,690
This new year celebration
is like public birthday.

6
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,352
l celebrate every occasion grandly,

7
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:38,326
l used to celebrate
new year very grandly,

8
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,396
because January 1st
is my birthday.

9
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:48,804
But l stopped celebrating
it from last year.

10
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,603
Today evening is Christmas party.

11
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,396
Tomorrow Australia is playing
against New Zealand.

12
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,576
One of the team is bound to win,
so another party to celebrate it.

13
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,672
This is 1 1th party in Melbourne
in 3 days.

14
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,972
This party is Sydney.

15
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,480
This place is good, right?
Can't we stay here for few more days?

16
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,379
ls there a guaranty
it'll stay like this?

17
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,451
lt can get hotter or
may rain anytime.

18
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:19,522
there's no guaranty,
you would still have the same feeling,

19
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,721
if it happens, instead of leaving this
place with bad memories,

20
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,630
it's better to leave when you
still love this place.

21
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,791
These short and
sweet moments are enough.

22
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,298
Okay.

23
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,000
Okay!

Dreams which will not come
real in near future...

28
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:03,926
lt's waste to spend time
thinking useless thoughts...

29
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,296
You've all with you is
the present time...

Travel along with it...

31
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:17,347

33
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,313
Will it ever stop at one place?

Don't imprison your thoughts?

00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:13,760
Dream about future and
making it come true next day...

42
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:20,769
lf hope becomes life,

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,891
This beautiful world is

48
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:24,297
That's why l'm telling you,

See all that is beautiful to eyes...

51
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,176
Tell this if anyone asks you...

52
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,941
Leaving this world with
a smile is heaven...

53
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,830
Go slow, why are you rushing?

54
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,297
l must be in Vizag by 31st.

55
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,563
l must be in Hyderabad
by 31st night.

56
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,406
Your fare.

57
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,345
Madam, please check this scheme.

58
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,682
lf l invest Rs.1000 now,
will it become Rs.5 lakhs in 10 years?

59
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:18,754
Yes madam.

60
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,650
How much would it become
after 40 years?

61
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,624
Scheme is good but 10 years
is very short period.

62
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,425
lf you've any retirement plans
tell me, l'll call you later.

63
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,634
Has flight touched down?
- An hour ago!

64
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,547
l got my luggage too.

65
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,113
Did you come to the airport?

66
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,385
Did l delay wantonly?

67
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,151
l got delayed because of
lousy Hyderabad traffic.

68
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:53,450
Moreover all automen
speak only in Hindi.

69
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:57,254
l said stop in Telugu and
he thought ahead in Hindi.

70
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,158
You say anything, fatso.

71
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,300
Don't call me like that, l hate it.

72
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,128
Come to the entrance.

73
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,413
Why only half of you is here?
Where's the other half?

74
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,077
Have l really grown thin, buddy?

75
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,911
Did l ever say truth?

76
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,410
No, buddy!

77
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,349
l told you not to call me like that.

78
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,251
l'll call you like that only,
you grandma!

79
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,585
l'll kick you, l'm not a grandma.

80
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,392
Who is he?

81
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,258
l don't know,
he sat next to me in the flight,

82
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,797
he looked handsome,
so l talked to me.

83
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,730
Useless man, he's married.

84
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,429
Oh God! You've three children!

85
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,005
That's why l call you as grandma.

86
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,871
Take me to some restaurant, l'm hungry.
- l must invite friends to the party.

87
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,103
We must catch an auto now.
- Are the bookings ready?

88
00:10:58,924 --> 00:10:59,515
Did you invite Geethi?

89
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,353
No need of her, we have split up.

90
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:05,689
She's not talking to me,
you too stop talking with her.

91
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,957
Hey Geet! Have you broken up
with my friend?

92
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,303
What about Ramya?

93
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,266
Kishore and Ramya are divorced?

94
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,739
Has Ramya eloped with Aslam?

95
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,033
How about her sister Pooja?

96
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,104
Has she given birth to a baby girl?

97
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,209
Did she marry?

98
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,574
She did.

99
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:22,907
Anyways, come with Kishore.

100
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,639
Why didn't you like my friend?

101
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,483
What did she say?

102
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,618
Did you try to kiss Geet?

103
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,656
l swear on my mother,
l never tried.

104
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,156
That's why she ditched you.

105
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,729
Relationships must be short and sweet.

106
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,299
l lost train ticket's cost because
of your incompetent lawyer.

107
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,369
Forget about the case,
l'll take care it.

108
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:49,006
What will you take care?
Court is closed tomorrow.

109
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,470
Then, shall we go to the
new year party?

110
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,005
l know...you don't like it but...

111
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:55,805
Then?

112
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,676
l came from Bangalore
for your sake.

113
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,714
Can't you come to the party
for my sake?

114
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:01,515
l want to write.

115
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,187
Face pack or hair oil?

116
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,582
No, diary.

117
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,382
When will you enjoy life then?

118
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,787
Why rush? Life is very long.

119
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,360
Life is very short,
don't miss the party.

120
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:29,941
We must give him
birthday bumps, 22!

121
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,108
l've to go to another party also.

122
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,843
Atleast three, dude!

123
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,054
With all might!

124
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,060
With great strength!

125
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,863
With full power!

126
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,802
Why did you stop it?
- You said only three, right?

127
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,170
Complete it, guys!

SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

129
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:19,824
Stop...stop...

130
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,264
We finished only 7!

131
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,934
l said three only.

132
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,610
Wearing churidar to this place.

133
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,216
She was writing something seriously
like preparing for exam in a party.

134
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,788
May be she's a journalist.

135
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:50,919
By the way, who is more beautiful,
girl or her outfit?

136
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,321
Both complemented
each other very well.

137
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,034
She vanished before l could
catch up with her.

138
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,729
Don't know where is she now.

139
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,201
Oye!

140
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,798
Give me those tissue papers, please.

141
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,654
Buddy!

142
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,918
She doesn't look like a regular.

143
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,737
My name is Uday.

144
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:36,500
Okay...

145
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:37,537
Your name?

146
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:38,974
Why?

147
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,739
My younger sister is marrying,
l want to invite you.

148
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,279
Marriage date?

149
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:48,183
lnauspicious month!
Moreover bad time!

150
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,581
Nobody marries then!

151
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:50,914
You don't have any knowledge.

152
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,420
l don't have a sister at all.

153
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,350
l told a lie to talk to you.

154
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,428
Okay, talk to me.

155
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,124
Party is very good, isn't it rocking?

156
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:02,428
l don't like parties.

157
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,501
What would you do then?

158
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,265
There are gentle showers
in Bhimli at this time,

159
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,568
l love getting wet in that rain
to welcome the new year.

160
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,109
lt's wonderful to think also.

161
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,314
What about this year?

162
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:21,185
What do you exactly want?
- Your name?

163
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,684
Opposite of your name.

164
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,116
My name's opposite?

165
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,725
So, your name is night.

166
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:30,791
Darkness...?

167
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,127
Star!

168
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,164
Moon...
Moonbeam?

169
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,332

Which year you were born?

174
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,718
l was born in that year.

175
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,356
Microsoft launched Windows
in the same year.

176
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,152
ln one year two magnificent
products were released...

177
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,564
You were talking nice to me,
why did you leave suddenly?

178
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,435
Tell me, what's your problem?

179
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,008
We don't match very well.

180
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:20,944
You're seven and l'm five.

181
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,578
According to numerology,
we can't be friends.

182
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:26,646
Even if we do, it will not last long.

183
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,953
Okay, let's be friends
for short time.

184
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,851
Relationships must be long lasting,
l like it that way.

185
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:53,209
250 yards of land on Vizag beach road,
100 sq. yard home,

186
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,539
bought under installment scheme
of a finance company.

187
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,613
Already you've lapsed
8 installments.

188
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:00,546
No sir...
- You keep quiet, grandma.

189
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,650
Who is Sandhya?
- Me!

190
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,688
You should've met me
on getting the letter.

191
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,621
l've been trying for a week.

192
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,719
l never stayed so long
away from home.

193
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,764
lt's not good to keep the
litigated property locked.

194
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:19,495
You go and stay there,
l'll apply for the stay order.

195
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,764
But the company is very tough.

196
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,648
Famous lndustrialist Brahmaji Rao,

197
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,978
expired suddenly in his home at 5 am
after a massive cardiac arrest.

198
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,782
Many VlPs are arriving
to pay their last respects.

199
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,992
Junior hasn't shed a tear.

200
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:48,325
There wasn't any bond
between father and son.

201
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,940
Your father talked about you
last morning also.

202
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,504
About me? My father?

203
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,010
They say a good must happen in
a home where a bad happens.

204
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,176
Do you've any daughter?

205
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:09,849
Why?

206
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,485
l had a doubt you're trying to get
your daughter married to me.

207
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:16,791
Think about it.

208
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,076
l want the address of the girl
l met in new year bash.

209
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,146
Why?

210
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,855
Stop buddy, this is her home.

211
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,728
Let's inquire about the girl
with neighbours.

212
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,232
Details will be useful.

213
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,067
What are you selling?
l see your hands are empty.

214
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,009
No..no...plot no:1 76...
- Name?

215
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,847
Oh God! For that flower plants girl?

216
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,311
Had any fight with her?

217
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:14,150
No, friend...

218
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,018
She never celebrates any
function or festival.

219
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,314
Even if we celebrate,
she'll notjoin us.

220
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,220
Last time when she came for
a function in my home,

221
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,361
she commented to reduce the
volume of loud speaker,

222
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:29,465
if not the function would be like
happening in her home.

223
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,829
She hates rich people like us.

224
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,665
Never had seen a girl like her.

225
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,670
She blindly follows superstitions
and astrology.

226
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:37,705
Numerology too.

227
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,605
Such perfect girls must only be
in novels and stories.

228
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:41,710
Not in colonies.

229
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:42,709
Come on boys.

230
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:44,477
Come!

231
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,387
My foot!

232
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,059
1 76 buddy!

233
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:02,493
Bloody lovers day!

234
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:08,234
February 14, people remember only you.

235
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,064
Getting numerous calls since morning.

236
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,742
Be careful!

237
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:14,002
People may pluck you in my absence.

238
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,237
Got it?

239
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:17,578
Oh my God!

240
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:19,711
Who is it?

241
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,649
lsn't he the man l met
in Hyderabad party...

242
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,484
You...? What are you doing here?

243
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,751
That's my question,
what are you doing here?

244
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,518
Will you enter without permission?

245
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,385
l entered to seek your permission.

246
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,022
Watch out plants!

247
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:38,527
l'll pay for it.

248
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,102
Can you bring back life
if it's dead?

249
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,272
Bloody money!

250
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,440
Tell me, what brings you here?

251
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:46,099
That is...plants...
l got a job in Vizag.

252
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,108
How does it concern me
if you get a job here?

253
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,711
That is...actually vastu is not
good in my horoscope.

254
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:56,210
l showed my palm to priest,
he says it's all dead.

255
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:00,687
To keep my job safe, it seems
l must plant a special...

256
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,060
What was that plant?

257
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:03,861
Mimosa?

258
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:06,690
Yes...Mimosa...Mimosa.

259
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:10,867
Technically l may be wrong but...
- l don't have it now.

260
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,502
Leave your phone number.

261
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,239
Don't mistake l'm rich seeing
my fancy number.

262
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:22,137
l'm very poor by birth.

263
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,316
After many struggles we have
reached middle class status.

264
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,378
ldea company belongs to him,
he got me that number.

265
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:34,053
l'll call you after l find Mimosa plant,
but your rich friend is barred to enter.

266
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,453
Close the gate while leaving.
- Okay.

267
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,196
Mimosa plant is enough to
get closer to Sandhya.

268
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,236
Buddy, that girl is in the bus.

269
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,999
What's this?
Don't you know this is ladies only bus?

270
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,766
l know, l'll get down after
talking to that girl.

271
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,808
Are you making fun of me?
Get down!

272
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:55,505
Wait, it's very urgent.

273
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,308
You won't listen to words.
Girls! Attack!

274
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:00,850
Push him down!

275
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:01,849
Sandhya!

276
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,079
Got Mimosa plant?

277
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,483
lt's life and death problem.

278
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:26,468
Home, college, bus are restricted
places to talk to you.

279
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,445
Look at my wounds.

280
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:30,374
l got hurt when l fell from
the compound wall.

281
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,645
The other day,
a girl bit me in the bus.

282
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:36,213
Do you know l had to take
4 injections on my abdomen.

283
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:38,981
Look, l don't like talking
to strangers.

284
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,718
lt's better you stop following me.
- No Sandhya. Saturn is tormenting me.

285
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,395
You are tormenting me like Saturn.

286
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,063
You're asking me wherever you like.

287
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,896
Sandhya please...

288
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:52,730
l'm not going to get you Mimosa plant.

289
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,735
Will you leave now or
shall l call the police?

290
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,565
Actually...

291
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,742
This is the last time l'm warning you.
Leave this place.

292
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,088
What are you doing here
without vacating the place?

293
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,089
Who are you?
Mind your words.

294
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:17,420
How dare you go to the court?

295
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:18,926
Won't you understand
if tell you politely?

296
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:22,157
What all this? Murthy...

297
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,767
Call him. Let me see who
dares to help you.

298
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,104
The case is in the court.

299
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:27,601
You will be on the streets
in few minutes.

300
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:28,932
You better get out.

301
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,041
That's what l am telling you too.
Understood?

302
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,174
Stop staring at me.

303
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,269
We are polite because
you are a girl.

304
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,609
What are you thinking about?

305
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:42,783
What's happening, boss?
- Loan recovery.

306
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,285
This is not the way to recover loans.

307
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,616
Who are you to say that?

308
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:51,123
What bothers you?
Go to court if it's a loan problem.

309
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:55,823
Call the police. Behaving like
goons with a girl is not good.

310
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,970
Yes. We are goons.
What will you do?

311
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,472
Seeking her permission to hit us?

312
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,577
Sandhya, make tea for us.

313
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:18,654
Do you mean to say that you'll
thrash us before she get tea?- Go.

314
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:30,725
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

315
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,435
You must be having 6 packs, right?

316
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,009
She has prepared tea. Drink & go.
- We will drink outside.

317
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,682
What are you saying, boss?
- Bye madam.

318
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,189
l spoke to them.
They will never disturb you.

319
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,189
Call me if you have any problem.
You have my number, don't you?

320
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,366
Oye, thanks.

321
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:13,342
Oh my God! Just miss.

322
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,604
l was saved because those goons
were sent by our company.

323
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:18,009
lf not, they would've thrashed me.
- What are you saying?

324
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:22,116
Sandhya took home loan from our company.
There is a case pending.

325
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,288
Really? What's the problem?

326
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,684
lf she knows this,
she will be after you.

327
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,087
ldiot. She doesn't like rich people.

328
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,960
Sandhya shouldn't know about
my background at any cost.

329
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,522
What shall we do now?

330
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,359
Find out where our office
is in Vizag.

331
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:44,467
Whom do you want to meet?

332
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:47,973
Who is the boss here?
- GM.

333
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:49,209
l want to meet the GM.

334
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,886
Without appointment,
anyone has to wait.

335
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:00,985
Security, how many times to tell you
not to allow everyone inside?

336
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:01,715
What's happening?

337
00:26:11,436 --> 00:26:12,562
Where is the home loan section?

338
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,241
Settle this case immediately.

339
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:22,413
What?

340
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:25,981
Our Hyderabad head office has started
legal proceedings on this property.

341
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,421
To stop that, MD has to sign.
- Then call the MD.

342
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,251
After your father's death,
MD post is vacant.

343
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:41,489
Get the papers ready for me
to take the post of MD.

344
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:44,695
Get me my suit from home.

345
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:55,670
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

346
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,714
Do you know what happened now?

347
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:07,950
The goons, officers, senior officers
came to my house & offered apologies.

348
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:08,625
Really?

349
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,796
l can pay the installments
anytime l want.

350
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:13,965
Okay. Do you have money
or shall l send some?

351
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:14,790
No.

352
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,467
Hope you're not using the money
saved for your marriage.- No.

353
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,297
l've a plan.

354
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:28,076
Sandhya...

355
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:31,810
Here's your Mimosa plant.

356
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:36,310
When l was looking for a place to
plant Mimosa, l saw this poster.

357
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,818
lt is also been mentioned
that it is only for girls.

358
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,084
Didn't you read that?
- l did.

359
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:47,157
lf you rent it for girls, you will have to
go police stations & TV channels.

360
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,424
Vizag girls are very decent.

361
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,898
They are not only decent
but they are angels.

362
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,434
But why would Vizag girls
live in rented house in Vizag?

363
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,671
Girls who come here are
from the other states.

364
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:01,004
Bombay girls are a blast.
l mean to say they like to party.

365
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,344
Hyderabad girls will fall
in love very easily.

366
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:05,516
After that, you'll find boys
near your house.

367
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:09,175
Missed calls, local calls,
trunk calls & even alcohol.

368
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:13,012
To be more precise,
meeting, chatting, dating & irritating.

369
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,685
But if you rent it to
a good bachelor like me...

370
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:20,856
l'll pay the rent you expect. Rs.5000.
Plus l'll pay 10 months advance.

371
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,026
l'll leave in the morning
and be back in the evening.

372
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,199
And more over, l don't need
girl friend when l have you around.

373
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:30,932
No one will come looking for me.
Please Sandhya, give me this room.

374
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:35,306
lt suits my budget & is near
to my office.- Okay.

375
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:38,209
l don't have any luggage.
l will come right away.- Not that.

376
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,213
You must be here
by 9 am sharp...

377
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:45,387
with a passport size photo,
lD proof, appointment letter,

378
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:50,049
and a local person to give surety.

379
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:53,230
lf everything is okay,
you both can stay here.

380
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,566
Both?
- You & your mimosa plant.

381
00:28:57,435 --> 00:28:58,299
Okay.

382
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,906
lt's a mere surety.
We'll arrange someone.

383
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,635
l've my uncle.
Why need someone else?

384
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,079
Dr. Harish Chandra Prasad...

385
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:17,580
Mother...

386
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,593
Good. You still remember me.

387
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:30,095
Hi uncle. How are you?
- l am fine.

388
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,926
l heard that you've taken
charge as MD.

389
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,105
lt was for name sake.

390
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:42,106
You are one of the top doctors in Asia.
Leaving that luxurious life style,

391
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,277
why do you live with herbs, trees, cows?
Why this sudden change?

392
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,618
ln my experience,

393
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:54,690
l felt that naturopathy is best to treatment
for patients without any side effects.

394
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:58,218
l've been running this clinic
successfully for 10 years.

395
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:05,125
lnstead of medicines, any disease can be
cured with personal attention & human touch.

396
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:09,372
Even with your mother's illness too,
l acted like a doctor & made a mistake.

397
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:12,634
lt would've been different
if l acted like a human being.

398
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,910
So, what made you come
to your uncle?

399
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,242
l'm going to stay as a
paying guest at a place.

400
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,474
You have to give surety for me.

401
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,652
When you have such a big bungalow,
why stay as a paying guest?

402
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,483
Ask him, uncle.
He is doing it for a girl.

403
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,327
Are you in love?

404
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:38,325
But l had a strange feeling
when l first saw her.

405
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,502
What so special about her?
- l don't know.

406
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:49,003
But whenever she calls me ''Oy'',
l hear a tune played on guitar.

407
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,008
Very precious.

408
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:56,453
Forget about surety.
l'll be there tomorrow morning.

409
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:13,060
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

410
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:34,624
An angel of love lives at door No:176,
beach house...

411
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:41,855
l first saw her in a
yellow churidhar & white chunni...

412
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:46,796
She casually called me ''Oye...Oye''...

413
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:53,376
Our eyes met for about 20 times...
and my empty heart is filled with her...

414
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,713
l fell in love at first sight...
love at first sight united me with her...

415
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,482
love at first sight l got her...

416
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:10,149
love at first sight, it bit me...

417
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:30,137
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

418
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:51,599
Her looks are beautiful, her acts are dutiful
and words are fundamental...

419
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,928
She is capable of everything...
She is very careful...

420
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,540
And she is very sentimental
and no love...

421
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:06,941
What you see in cinema...
you don't get that in city...

422
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:13,784
True that l found one...
in Vizag sea shore...

423
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,789
Love at first sight...

424
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:26,802
l felt the chill. My love for her grew bigger
and l flew higher & higher...

425
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:04,872
Money is allergy... Devotion
gives energy...believes Numerology...

426
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:08,875
Nursery infront of her house...
Never accepts naughtiness...

427
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,845
And never likes humour...

428
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:16,444
Expecting perfection in everything...

429
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:23,186
She must be in army...
- There is something special about her...

430
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:32,201
which dragged me to her in a flash...
lt is celebrations time...

431
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:35,431
Love at first sight...
lt is my boon...

432
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:38,836
Love at first sight...
Every second is an eon...

433
00:34:57,328 --> 00:35:07,294
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

434
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,303
He must have told her
about my background.

435
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,869
This is not an simple matter.
lt's a very big matter.

436
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:50,107
What? Haven't you told her
the actual matter?

437
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:52,706
About what, uncle?

438
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:56,876
That you've to seek permission in
your office & will be late.- Yes, right.

439
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,218
lt's my new job. Take this.

440
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:01,054
l had to struggle hard
to get permission.

441
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,784
Have you joined this company?
- Yes.

442
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,394
My MD is very strict.
He's a tiger.

443
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:09,896
Tell him my name. He will mew like a cat.
- Really?

444
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,904
He tried to take away this house from me.
l filed a case in the court.

445
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,573
Then he came down for a settlement.
He is proud of his wealth.

446
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,132
Why talk about all that now?

447
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:23,803
lf l get him or his relatives, l will...
- l'll take leave.

448
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:26,806
Please do come when you find time.

449
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:31,653
Since you're this company's staff,
those goons left.

450
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,416
l thought something great
about you.

451
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,352
Take care of my house.

452
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:51,171
Guruji...

453
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:54,176
Why isn't he opening the door?
ls he sleeping?

454
00:36:54,445 --> 00:37:02,409
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

455
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:04,583
Abhishek...

456
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:05,949
l will shake you up.

457
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:07,488
When there is a calling bell,
why did you call?

458
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:08,659
l felt the heat.

459
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:11,350
l can't sell insurance policies, boss.

460
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:13,520
lf l thought l can't do it,

461
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,461
l wouldn't have come up in life.

462
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:18,101
When l ask people to take insurance policies,
they are abusing me.

463
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:24,233
Selling insurance is
giving bad news coolly.

464
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:27,477
Tell the bad news like
a birthday greeting.

465
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:28,804
lt's an art.

466
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:31,878
Look, they all are my customers.

467
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,317
The red one is Mohan.

468
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:37,578
The yellow one is Appa Rao.
The blue one is Babji.

469
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,585
They were all my customers once.

470
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:43,017
Now they are leading a peaceful life.
- Yes.

471
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:44,421
They are very happy.

472
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:47,462
They asked me whether they can
reach me in times of trouble?

473
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,256
l promised them that l will.

474
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,901
That's why l rented this room here
though there is no bathroom.

475
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,674
You need some preparation, my boy.
Even you will settle in life.

476
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,069
What do you mean by preparation?

477
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,175
l will tell you.

478
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,741
Before going to the
field every morning,

479
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,508
lnvite trouble from these
women waiting for water,

480
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,110
Listen to their abusive words.

481
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,279
Later on abusive words used by your
customers will be like munching chocolates.

482
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,356
Why would anyone abuse me
for nothing?

483
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:18,086
Ask them what you shouldn't ask?

484
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,195
They will abuse you continuously.

485
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:21,695
Ask what?

486
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,492
Abhishek...

487
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,199
l will shake them up.
- l don't know.

488
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,298
Come here.

489
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,971
Apart from ugly faces like you,
aren't there any beauties here?

490
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:35,202
Hey you...

491
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:36,471
How dare you say that, you blacky!

492
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,114
You seem to haunt us
in our dreams.

493
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,180
Don't you have any shame?

494
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:40,816
Do you want beautiful women?

495
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:42,383
Am l your dream boy?

496
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:44,816
Dream boy?
You look like a room boy.

497
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:45,784
How is he then?

498
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,082
Like a lifebouy soap.

499
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,384
You dirty scoundrels!

500
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:50,389
How do they know that?

501
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:51,492
Enjoy man.

502
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:52,890
What enjoy?

503
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,462
You rotten beggars!

504
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,998
You go on a donkey ride!
You scums!

505
00:38:58,202 --> 00:38:59,601
lf l am donkey, what is he then?

506
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,829
He's a useless fellow.

507
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:02,971
My shit!

508
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:09,813
Look, water is coming. Go.

509
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,244
Stop talking with such scumbags.
Let's go.

510
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:14,782
How do you feel now?

511
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:16,543
l feel a new courage.

512
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,254
For you to get a new
courage everyday,

513
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,185
l have recorded all their
abuses in this tape.

514
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,655
Go & enjoy.
Sell the policies.

515
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,894
Sir, take an insurance policy.
- Wait.

516
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,529
How many times to tell you?

517
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:27,425
Just a policy.

518
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,258
Can't you see me talking on phone?
Are you blind?

519
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,297
You stupid.

520
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:31,932
You tell me.

521
00:39:34,605 --> 00:39:44,571
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

522
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,283
l called you so many times,
but you never picked my call.

523
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,478
Though the place is new to me,
l had a good night sleep.

524
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:52,917
lt is very nice, fatso.

525
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,088
This house, myself & Sandhya.

526
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,692
l will love her and
settle happily in life.

527
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,294
l don't need anything more.

528
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:01,591
No one will come in our path.

529
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:03,230
Oh God!

530
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:04,298
What happened?

531
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,562
Three girls in the hall.
ln 3 sizes, small, medium & large.

532
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,332
She rented me the house but
is still conducting the interview.

533
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,565
l will call you later.

534
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,202
Who are you girls?

535
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,541
Did you come here seeing the poster?

536
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,974
She has rented me this house.
You can leave.

537
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:18,273
Please go.

538
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,144
They are my children.

539
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:22,309
Who are you?

540
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,144
She is my best friend.

541
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:25,219
Really?

542
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,051
Are they your children?

543
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,487
Okay. l am getting late to
catch my train, bye.

544
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:31,626
Shall l drop you at the station?

545
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,721
lf you don't mind, Sandhya...

546
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:35,322
Take care of the bike.

547
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,433
You don't have say that.
Your bike is my bike.

548
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:38,829
Come...

549
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,103
Come...

550
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,234
Where would Sandhya park her bike?

551
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:51,110
This one...?

552
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,685
Don't you ever suspect your friend?

553
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:56,682
For what?

554
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:02,221
A boy you don't know is staying
in her home as a paying guest.

555
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:05,324
And you left without asking
her any question.

556
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:06,359
Cool man.

557
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,623
l like her character and
individuality very much.

558
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:14,293
That's why l leave my children
with her every vacation.

559
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:17,565
Because l want my children to be
like Sandhya & not like me.

560
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:23,178
Sandhya has a list of specifications
for an ideal husband.

561
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:26,675
She has a list of qualities
required for her future husband.

562
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,545
You have none of those qualities.

563
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,014
So, cool man.

564
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:31,479
One more thing.

565
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,554
l've already found a boy
with those qualities.

566
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:36,225
l will introduce him to her
next month when l come here.

567
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,636
She must have kept the
list in this room.

568
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,744
But l'm barred to enter.

569
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,811
Who would help me now?

570
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,593
Three angels!

571
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,428
Quiet. You are still a kid.

572
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:18,829
l am not a kid.

573
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,436
Look, we don't talk to strangers.

574
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:22,503
Really?

575
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,931
Then, my name is Uday.
What's your name?

576
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,705
You're not a kid to get scared of me.

577
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,374
Ain't l?

578
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:36,951
My name is Sreelakshmi.

579
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,714
Sree Vijayalakshmi alias Viji.

580
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:40,447
Bhagyalakshmi alias...

581
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:41,454
Bajji.

582
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,019
l don't have any nick names.

583
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:46,793
She's very much like Sandhya.
- lsn't she?

584
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,563
You hit her weakest point.

585
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,637
She thinks she's like Sandhya.

586
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:57,966
You gave me a very good point.
Now watch.

587
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,500
Sandhya...l forgot to tell you...

588
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:01,643
Oh my God!

589
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:04,605
l thought you were Sandhya...

590
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:06,942
You are trying to...

591
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,142
Wow!

592
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:11,981
The way you respect and
your manners are very similar.

593
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:13,679
ls it true?
- True.

594
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:15,358
A copy of Sandhya.

595
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:16,685
Just one thing missing.

596
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:17,724
What is it?

597
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:21,996
You won't be having Sandhya's
ideal husband list of qualities.

598
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:24,463
Why won't l?
My list is also the same.

599
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:26,465
The boy must be minimum 6 feet tall.

600
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,730
He should not lie.
He should be God fearing.

601
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,465
No smoking or drinking.

602
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:34,507
Should know about household work.

603
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,044
Shouldn't be born rich.

604
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:40,216
Should have a big family.
Must be a post graduate.

605
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:43,113
Must have a good sense of humour,
and above all,

606
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,347
he should be strong enough to pull
the anchor & put it infront of the house.

607
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,897
l always felt wrong about this girl.

608
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,466
She is superb.

609
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,328
That's why she has such a superb list.

610
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:06,165
l'll prove her that l've all
those qualities in me.

611
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,743
l can easily lift this.

612
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:22,748
lt's enough. Get up.

613
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:27,430
Get up.
- Please...let me sleep for a while.

614
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,859
Please sister.

615
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,830
Oye...Oye...

616
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:36,968
Were you sleeping?

617
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,163
No. l'm offering prayers to God.

618
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:39,239
lt's almost over.

619
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:40,603
Then come down. Let's do yoga.

620
00:44:40,811 --> 00:44:42,506
That's not in the list.
- What?

621
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:43,702
l'm coming.

622
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:45,643
You start. l will join you.

623
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,409
Do you know yoga?

624
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,280
Know?

625
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:54,451
l used to teach yoga.

626
00:44:55,059 --> 00:45:00,622
When l was doing my post graduate,
people called me Bharat Thakur.

627
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,399
Since l have no bad habits,

628
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:08,533
l'm strong from then to till now.

629
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:13,203
Just order me, l will put that
anchor infront of your gate.

630
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:16,270
Forget about anchor.

631
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,607
First teach them yoga.

632
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:26,021
lf you do the lambasana.
which l am going to show you,

633
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,248
you will grow an inch
taller everyday.

634
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,428
By doing this lambasana,
l am going to 6 feet soon.

635
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,517
This is the highlight of
this lambasana.

636
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,301
ls this screaming part
of this lambasana?

637
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:14,699
My body got locked.
Can you please help me?

638
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,174
Make fun of anything
but not yoga.

639
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:30,178
l feel very hungry.

640
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:36,716
Are you not eating?

641
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,896
She is fasting today for Lord Ragavendra.
Tomorrow she'll fast for Sai Baba.

642
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:40,791
Day after tomorrow...?

643
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,661
Sister Sandhya, rasam is superb.

644
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,962
Why don't you try brother Uday?

645
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:52,471
Don't call me brother.
lt's enough if you call me Uday.

646
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:56,106
One girl called me brother.

647
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,908
She failed 10th class exams twice.
Do you know that?

648
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,509
l've more such sentiments, Sandhya.

649
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:06,181
Once my grandfather...
l mean my grandfather's brother...

650
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,688
When he was going to my
3rd brother's 4th daughter's house,

651
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:09,722
l sneezed.

652
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:13,886
l advised him not to go but he went.
He didn't come back.

653
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:15,029
What happened to him?

654
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:17,097
He went to the railway station.

655
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:18,928
He got in to the train and
went to his native place.

656
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,738
l cracked a small joke.

657
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:27,874
My 4th aunt was flattered by my jokes
and presented me with this T-shirt.

658
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:30,546
Armani is a costly brand, right?

659
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:33,415
These are duplicates.

660
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:36,677
We get all duplicates
in Trimalgiri in Hyderabad.

661
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:38,377
That phone must be China made.

662
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:40,056
You are right.

663
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:44,157
Rasam is superb.

664
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,192
Won't you add curd?
- No.

665
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:48,387
lt will be nice.
Do you guarantee that?

666
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,931
There is no guarantee that l would get
the same feeling eating curd.

667
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:57,134
lt might taste tangy
or tasteless.

668
00:47:57,407 --> 00:48:00,968
lnstead of spoiling the taste,
it is better to stop with rasam.

669
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:04,242
Short & sweet moments
are enough for me.

670
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:14,417
How can l sleep early and
get up early everyday?

671
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:17,653
l am not used to sleeping on time.

672
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,658
Mine is night life.

673
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:22,994
Please tell your madam.

674
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,861
Sandhya...

675
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,832
What do you want?
- Mimosa plant...

676
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:30,366
Mimosa plant?
You rascal...

677
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:32,905
Who is that?

678
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:40,245
Oye...

679
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:44,346
lt's 10:30 am.
Aren't you going to office today?

680
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,816
l am going.

681
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:48,685
Did you take bath?
- Long back.

682
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,253
Today is Tuesday.
You must take head bath.

683
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:53,096
l did.

684
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,795
lt's very nice here, father.

685
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:05,370
How are uncle & aunt?

686
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:08,706
Leave?
No way.

687
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,337
l too want to see you.

688
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:13,045
l will try.

689
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,284
They don't understand.

690
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:17,817
l joined the company very recently.

691
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,352
They want me to take
leave & come there.

692
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:23,318
Tell them to come here.
- Notjust 1 or 2.

693
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,051
You might have heard
aboutjoint family.

694
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:28,231
Mine is a giant family.
- Really?

695
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,332
l like such big families.

696
00:49:32,169 --> 00:49:34,831
l'm free this Sunday.
lnvite them for lunch.

697
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:35,970
No.

698
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:38,971
Wishes of those who love you
shouldn't go in vain.- What?

699
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:42,839
Your family members who love you
want to meet you.

700
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:44,911
Ask them to come here.
That's all.

701
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,248
Okay.

702
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:52,580
Where are you now?

703
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:55,485
ln your house, in your bath tub
taking a good bath.

704
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,250
l want you to set up
a duplicate family for me.

705
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,292
They must be very good looking.
- l will arrange it.

706
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,361
l'll bring them there.
- l will kill you.

707
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:03,260
First l must like them.

708
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:04,161
Okay.

709
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,302
l got myself committed
to a job unnecessarily.

710
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:09,995
Had l told college, l could sit at home
saying it's summer holidays.

711
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:12,038
l could've avoided this
office headache.

712
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:23,212
Have you taken leave today?
- They gave me leave.

713
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:26,680
Reason?
- Gruesome.

714
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:30,753
My office receptionist Nancy.

715
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:36,424
She came out to go
to office like always.

716
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:38,726
She was about to cross the
road to catch an auto,

717
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:43,537
a bus ran over Nancy.
- God!

718
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:46,140
That was her last word.

719
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:54,749
First take bath.

720
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:56,248
Do you think l didn't take bath?

721
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,546
lt is because you have
come after her cremation.

722
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,452
Finally, l have a chance to
spend time with Sandhya.

723
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:12,959
Slowly Viji.

724
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:15,400
Why are you in a hurry?
Where are you going?

725
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:17,502
Shouldn't ask such questions
while someone is going out.

726
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,669
l've finished taking bath.
l will dress up in 2 minutes.

727
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:25,637
Then Nancy...?

728
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,750
l never thought your death
will go waste.

729
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:39,224
Why is Sandhya wearing
specs all the time?

730
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:41,563
Poor sight?
- For safety.

731
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,131
To stop dust falling into her eyes.

732
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:48,065
l always felt something is
wrong about her.

733
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:51,838
Sandhya has good qualities.

734
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,243
Devotion to God.

735
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,370
Fasting for Sai Baba.

736
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:01,942
A day for every God.

737
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:05,653
You also ring the bell as
if you are a big devotee.

738
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,918
l must do that for love.
l must do anything for love.

739
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,254
Your love will be a success.

740
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:16,996
One more for my favourite Sree.

741
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:21,332
This is nothing.
l can lift it very easily.

742
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:30,337
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

743
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:35,378
l wish to see Sandhya with lose hair
and without specs.

744
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:38,683
Sandhya...

745
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,752
Where is Sandhya?
- Do you want Mimosa plant?

746
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,723
l got married long back.

747
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:48,060
Good, my shit!
Are you a hen?

748
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:49,062
Say it in Telugu.

749
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:53,933
Or l will cut your damn
English speaking tongue.

750
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:55,126
Why would l need a sari?

751
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:57,435
Teasing me with
double meaning words?

752
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,040
l'll use my word power.

753
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:00,971
You lousy betrayer!

754
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,636
Master, his Telugu knowledge is zero.

755
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,005
So, that's it.

756
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:08,576
Why have you come here?

757
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:10,719
Next week is Telugu language week.

758
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:12,912
Fragrance of Telugu must spread
along with greenery.

759
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:13,782
l got it.

760
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:15,480
You want it to be decorated
with flower plants.

761
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,125
At least 1000 plants.

762
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,352
l will give you Rs.10000
and travelling expenses.

763
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:20,655
Rs.10000?

764
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:22,228
Rs.5000 as advance.

765
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,329
l will take the pots
day after tomorrow.

766
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:25,692
Master...
- Yes.

767
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:29,338
lf you find time, teach our children
Telugu an hour every day.

768
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,471
Sure.

769
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:32,733
Bye idiot.

770
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:33,842
ldiot!

771
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,841
lt's a commonly used word.

772
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,344
Why is your Telugu language so different?

773
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,684
Then talk in Telugu for 1 minute.
Only in Telugu.

774
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:50,385
Hey...
- Tell me.

775
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:52,789
Get me a good Telugu dialogue
oriented movie DVD.

776
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,524
You keep watching.

777
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,336
Very soon Sandhya will faint
listening to my pure Telugu.

778
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,838
What did you say?

779
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:10,702
What? Did you say a low caste
man is not qualified?

780
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,382
What an arrogance!

781
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,852
This is a talent competition
not a royal competition.

782
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:18,543
lt must never be one.

783
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:22,218
Yes.

784
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:25,417
l asked you to send a DVD to learn Telugu.
Why did send me a foreign language DVD?

785
00:54:25,629 --> 00:54:26,960
There are no subtitles too.

786
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:30,097
lt's Telugu spoken by NTR.
Learn that.

787
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,101
Why are you looking so dull?

788
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:38,240
She agreed to deliver the
plants to Master.

789
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:40,534
But now she is down with fever.

790
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,146
Why are you saying this is
good news with a long face?

791
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,148
Leader, don't mind.
l have a small job.

792
00:54:49,352 --> 00:54:52,412
l will record you in this.

793
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,920
This is a talent competition
not a royal competition.

794
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,998
lt must never be one.

795
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,834
You were born in a mud pot, right?

796
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:15,739
No. l was born in JJ hospital.

797
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:18,773
Think about how your father
Bharadwaj was born?

798
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:22,384
My father's name is Prasad.
- That's very nasty...

799
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:26,945
What an arrogance!

800
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,631
Your parents. Are they fine?

801
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:40,794
No. My watchman & his wife.

802
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:45,807
Bring someone educated and
should match my skin tone.

803
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,138
Who is he?

804
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:54,110
Uncle...Emperor of Gandhara!

805
00:55:58,054 --> 00:55:59,487
Forgive me, Master.

806
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,383
l couldn't finish your work.
- Getting smart with me.

807
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,050
Sandhya knows to crack jokes too.

808
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:07,493
Take your balance money.

809
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:11,156
The plants are loaded in the van.
l am leaving.

810
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,727
Uday got everything ready.

811
00:56:14,938 --> 00:56:16,235
We helped him too.

812
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:19,465
We slept, but he worked all night.

813
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:26,509
Where is Uday?

814
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:28,113
Go away!

815
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:31,014
You told me to bring a family
which suits your skin tone.

816
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,518
How could you bring these people?

817
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:41,191
He has changed his mind.
Let's go.

818
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,160
You shit!

819
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:54,877
lt's not possible.

820
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,773
Rules don't permit to pay
the money now.

821
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,675
Call me when you are dead.
We will pay you then.

822
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:00,347
l can't.

823
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,541
l can't sell insurance policies.

824
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:04,709
lf l thought l can't do it,

825
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:06,546
l wouldn't have come up in life.

826
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,690
l told you to prepare well.
- What preparation?

827
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:09,824
You told me to smile when they
abuse me, l smiled.

828
00:57:10,026 --> 00:57:10,788
What's their problem then?

829
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:12,586
When l smile, they beat me to pulp.

830
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,825
Are they taking that route?

831
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:18,557
Getting beaten up is an art.

832
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,395
Try to enjoy it.

833
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,399
Come, l will show you how.

834
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,662
Will you get me beaten up?

835
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:24,061
Abhishek.

836
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:26,298
l will shake you up.
Come.

837
00:57:35,652 --> 00:57:37,210
What you are doing is wrestling, right?

838
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,182
What else is this?

839
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:40,083
Didn't l tell you, this is wrestling?

840
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,589
Are these real muscles or graphics?

841
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:44,985
Trying to tease me?

842
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:47,487
Listen.
To hell with your stupid doubts.

843
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,630
Hope this is not acting.

844
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,590
You & your stupid doubts.

845
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:56,966
These doubts are his & not mine.
Go & clarify your doubts.

846
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:58,401
Come l will show you.
Go.

847
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:00,041
Go. He will show you.

848
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:01,107
Go.

849
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,413
No. l know nothing.

850
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:07,879
Now l understood.
His doubts were genuine.

851
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:09,381
You only scare him.
But you don't beat him.

852
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:12,180
You are acting & your muscles
are graphics.

853
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:15,957
Beat him.

854
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:18,587
Good.

855
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:26,464
Are you doubts cleared?
Come boys.

856
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:29,362
He is now fixed in the sand.

857
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:33,432
No one can beat you
this hard anymore.

858
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,702
Go & sell the policies.

859
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:37,173
Got knocked out, idiot!

860
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:57,723
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

861
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:19,414
Go.
Go l say.

862
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,551
Learning new habits.

863
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:26,885
l told you. She will not change.
Let's go.

864
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:31,162
Go inside.
- Sandhya...

865
00:59:31,801 --> 00:59:34,065
What?
- To tell you the truth...

866
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,294
What will you say now?

867
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:38,739
That it was your fault
and not theirs.

868
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:41,374
You know what's in my mind.

869
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,012
Now you know what's in my mind.

870
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:59,118
Hey Sandhya...come out.

871
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:03,060
Sandhya, come out.

872
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,498
Sandhya, come out.

873
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:09,601
Where is your sister?
Tell her to come out.

874
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:13,765
She went out looking for you.
- Really?

875
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,342
All my acting has gone in vain.

876
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,774
Since she has such big eyes,
she stares at me.

877
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:26,750
She closed the doors on my face.
- lt's alright. Come inside.

878
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:31,453
She must apologize
infront of everyone.

879
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:33,557
l won't come in unless
she apologists.

880
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,937
Don't you have any sense.
Where did you go?

881
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:44,568
Switched off your phone.
Playing games with me.

882
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:47,070
l went looking for you
like a mad girl.

883
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,171
Can't l shout at you?

884
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:52,870
l was wrong in slapping her.

885
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:54,413
But how could you
leave the house?

886
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:57,174
Get inside.

887
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,628
You said she must apologise.
- l did.

888
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:11,433
Uday, you are wasting time.
- ls it? Okay, let's go.

889
01:01:12,535 --> 01:01:13,160
Not here.

890
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:14,734
l mean you're wasting time
in her matter.

891
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,641
What's there about her?
- Stop over acting.

892
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:19,899
l'm telling you this
out of my experience.

893
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:23,806
Girls like her want to
be proposed directly.

894
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:33,219
Sandhya...
- l remember. Today is Sunday.

895
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:35,084
Your family members are coming.

896
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:36,815
That's why l am cooking
these special dishes.

897
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:43,826
l'm preparing it little spicy.

898
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,524
Will it be fine with them?
- lt's okay.

899
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:52,606
Phone switched off...!

900
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:04,219
Come. Get down.
- Make it fast.

901
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,854
Fasto saved my ass.

902
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:08,352
Thank God you have come.

903
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,287
Who is the daddy here?
You?

904
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:11,517
Tuck in your shirt.

905
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:14,252
ls she my grand mother?
Her make up is good.

906
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:15,158
Who is my mother?

907
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:19,860
What is your character?
Okay come.

908
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:20,592
Sandhya...my giant family
has arrived.

909
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:22,794
Kiran, find out what he is talking?

910
01:02:23,005 --> 01:02:25,371
Who are you?
- Are you my brother?

911
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,066
You look like a basket ball player.
Go back.

912
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:29,938
Look, no over acting.

913
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:34,173
Make it subtle like in English films.
- What?

914
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:35,884
Why are you here?

915
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,284
Didn't l tell you that l will
bring that boy for Sandhya?

916
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,615
He and his family.
Come in.

917
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,296
Sandhya...
Please come in. Sit.

918
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:56,337
Didn't l tell you?
Kiran & his parents.

919
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:00,666
l told you about Sandhya, didn't l?
She is Sandhya.

920
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:03,937
That boy has all the
qualities of an ideal husband.

921
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,604
My parents.

922
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:12,719
lt seems he never lies.
He is very frank.

923
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:14,755
Your tea is not that good.

924
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:16,692
My mom makes tea much better.

925
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:18,918
Quiet. She is still young.

926
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,254
A very big family.

927
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:24,365
lf she gets settled in Bangalore,
we have nothing to do here.- Yes.

928
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:26,799
This house will sell
for a good price.

929
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:30,101
His sense of humour is also good.

930
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:31,830
Do you know which
leaves take divorce?

931
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:35,404
Mango leaves.

932
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,346
Uncle, did you hear this joke?
- What?

933
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:44,384
Children, come down.
lt's time to leave.

934
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:47,283
Look, don't bother about
what they said. Cool.

935
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,048
He will go to US in 2 months.

936
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:51,419
He wants to get married before that.

937
01:03:53,729 --> 01:03:55,390
l thought she would
throw you out in 2 days.

938
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,467
You must be really great
to have stayed here so long.

939
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,764
They are grown up now.

940
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,460
Next time, you don't have
to bring them here.

941
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,037
They can come here by themselves.

942
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,313
Your family members are
supposed to come today.

943
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:16,416
Why didn't they come?

944
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:19,814
l don't have a family.

945
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:25,217
l lied fearing that you might
ask me to vacate the house.

946
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:30,122
lt's better you don't have one.

947
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,473
Greetings, l am Uday's own father.

948
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:41,000
You shut up.

949
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,404
Always shuts me off.

950
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:47,481
Entire family is here.
Unlike him we all are little fat.

951
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:48,911
lf everyone comes at the same time,
you will get scared.

952
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:52,246
So, we will come one by one.
Next, l will send his mother.

953
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,952
Shut up.
Always shuts me off.

954
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:00,927
Are you Sandhya?

955
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:02,024
My husband told me.

956
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,027
Hasn't anyone come with you?

957
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:04,859
Didn't he tell you that
we will come one by one?

958
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,591
Next will be his grand mother.

959
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:13,234
Grandson, Sandhya is very beautiful.

960
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:14,909
You seem to have lost weight.

961
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:17,705
Our family members are very fat.
But you are so thin.

962
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:20,576
Eat well & make our family proud.

963
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:22,710
Next will be his uncle.

964
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:27,686
Oh God!

965
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:33,354
l told her that l don't have a family.

966
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:39,257
Why did you come to temple, Guruji?
- Don't be surprised.

967
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:43,165
People who come to temple
come with devotion or fear.

968
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:46,466
The second category people
come with the fear of death.

969
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:48,234
We must cash their fear
on the spot.

970
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,469
How will we know
who comes with what?

971
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:53,572
Experience, my boy.

972
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:56,917
Look at that girl.

973
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,746
She must have come with fear.

974
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,321
l can easily pin her down.
Come.

975
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:03,518
Greetings madam.
- Greetings.

976
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:05,591
Do you come to this ant hill everyday?

977
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:06,819
What bothers you?

978
01:06:08,364 --> 01:06:10,093
You know that snakes live in this.

979
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:11,789
Snake bites are dangerous.

980
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:13,696
So, we must make our life secured.

981
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:14,995
You must have understood
what l am trying to say.

982
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:17,502
Yes, l do.
You are a snake charmer.

983
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,474
Do you have a policy?
- Yes, l do.

984
01:06:25,681 --> 01:06:27,273
Really? What policy?

985
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:31,580
l don't talk to strangers.
That's my policy.- Stop her.

986
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:33,950
What do you mean by insurance?

987
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,316
lt's an income your family
gets after your death.

988
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:36,786
Anything that comes after
our death is useless.

989
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:37,789
We will give that money
to your nominee.

990
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,963
You take my money,
do business,

991
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,393
and return back my money
with some interest. Right?

992
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,191
She is right, isn't she?
Yes.

993
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:47,369
Actually...
- Do you have an insurance policy?

994
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:48,468
No, he doesn't.

995
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,565
Will you live forever?
- No one has that option.

996
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:53,272
First, you take a policy.

997
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:55,333
And for him?
- Give him that policy.

998
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:57,535
And for you?
- l've no nominees.

999
01:06:57,747 --> 01:06:58,577
l don't want it.

1000
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:00,913
You could've told this before.

1001
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:02,311
l don't tell anything
without asking me.

1002
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:03,985
That's my main policy.

1003
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,785
Four letters.

1004
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:09,180
Starts with L and ends with E.

1005
01:07:13,629 --> 01:07:15,654
lt's already late.

1006
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:19,899
lf you quit the game in the middle,
it means you lost.

1007
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,198
Okay. l lost.
And l am tired too.

1008
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:36,841
There is no water.
The overhead tank is empty.

1009
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:38,042
Switch on the motor.

1010
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:41,115
Why don't l get such ideas?

1011
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:48,894
Sandhya, it is very urgent.

1012
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:51,622
Won't you let me sleep?

1013
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:54,325
The tank is full.
- Switch off the motor.

1014
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:57,436
And then, you jump into the tank.

1015
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:06,908
What's your problem?

1016
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,740
What for are these balloons
and colourful papers?

1017
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:24,960
l don't know whether you
celebrate your birthday or not.

1018
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,464
Since you are celebrating your
birthday with me this time,

1019
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:30,605
l will give you a gift for every month
till your next birthday.

1020
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,971
l brought 12 gifts.

1021
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,353
For you to be cool & happy.
Greetings in ice.

1022
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:58,323
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

1023
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:08,168
ln western countries, this is gifted
as a symbol of friendship.

1024
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:09,708
This is to mark our friendship...

1025
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,452
Beauty guarded by thorns.

1026
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:26,458
To get happiness & to admire beauty,
we first have to cross the thorns.

1027
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:36,298
Happiness is not for yourself

1028
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:39,201
but it is something to be shared
with others, a heavenly medicine.

1029
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:42,510
Wherever you go,
this fragrance follows you.

1030
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:51,917
l've loaded all my favourite songs.
Music relaxes your mind.

1031
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:54,646
lt's the best way for a peace of mind.
Just for you.

1032
01:09:57,426 --> 01:09:59,223
You love offering prayers
to God, don't you?

1033
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:03,163
These incense sticks will take
your wishes directly to God.

1034
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:12,263
A tea set represents a family.

1035
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:14,040
This jug is the husband.

1036
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:16,470
The cups are the children.
And wife?

1037
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:22,918
The hot tea inside the jug
represents wife.

1038
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:33,455
Though it melts, it gives light to others
till the very last breath.

1039
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:36,898
A perfect example for
sacrifice are these candles.

1040
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:45,102
To gift happiness in a small pack
chocolates are the best.

1041
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:48,475
Anyone who tastes it
will be delighted.

1042
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:49,666
You too.

1043
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:56,116
Laughing Buddha.
China's Vinayaka.

1044
01:10:56,318 --> 01:11:00,584
When you are in sorrows, see this
Buddha for 20 seconds & you'll smile.

1045
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:04,555
lf you keep this near the main door,
even bad news will make you laugh loud.

1046
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:14,797
There will be 100 colourful
sparks when you light them.

1047
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:17,439
Life span of these
crackers are too short.

1048
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,370
But as long as they live,
they live bright.

1049
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:26,041
l don't know whether you
like these 1 1 gifts or not.

1050
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:29,074
Because l bought them
according to my taste.

1051
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:34,014
But l believe that you
will love the 12th gift.

1052
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:38,058
Because it is in tune with
your taste & a long lasting gift.

1053
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:43,226
lt's me.

1054
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:50,535
l will be with you all your life.

1055
01:11:52,241 --> 01:11:54,766
According to Numerology,
l want our names to match.

1056
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:57,041
So, l have added a letter
in my name.

1057
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:00,314
lf you are ready to
accept me as a gift,

1058
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,181
l am all yours.

1059
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:11,351
So, think.

1060
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:13,927
Tell me your decision by sunset.

1061
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:17,698
l'll be waiting for you in the beach.

1062
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:40,545
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

1063
01:12:53,435 --> 01:13:01,001
l thought you would come
to me with a smile...

1064
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:09,043
and would spark my desire
with your love...

1065
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:17,257
l looked for you in the
breeze which caresses me...

1066
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:25,230
l stood on the shores
waiting for you...

1067
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:43,376
l love to spend my life with you
in every following birth...

1068
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:55,620
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

1069
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:21,384
We come together in love...

1070
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:29,392
Will the love betray us?

1071
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:37,070
Would flowers turn into thorns?

1072
01:14:37,739 --> 01:14:43,803
Would water turn into fire to burn me?

1073
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:51,714
Shall l bar fate and win over you?

1074
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:57,652
l am eagerly waiting for you...

1075
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:26,711
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

1076
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:30,475
Do you live in this house?
- l used to.

1077
01:16:30,919 --> 01:16:32,409
But l am vacating the house now.

1078
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:33,918
Then, you must be Uday.

1079
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:36,553
l am Abhishek, lnsurance agent.

1080
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:38,419
Earlier, Sandhya told me
that she had no nominee.

1081
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:40,185
But yesterday,
she called me to take a policy.

1082
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:41,828
She wrote Uday as the nominee.

1083
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:43,622
l thought she meant the Sun.

1084
01:16:43,832 --> 01:16:45,663
Now l understood that
you are Uday.

1085
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:48,232
Yes.

1086
01:16:48,503 --> 01:16:52,439
lf she had mentioned your name,
you must be very special.

1087
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:54,273
Will you give her these papers?

1088
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:07,748
What?

1089
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:10,922
What happened?

1090
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:17,427
None should've witnessed
such a party in Vizag.

1091
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:18,600
Arrange for a floating platform.

1092
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,358
Pour flowers from the helicopter.

1093
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:27,603
l will call you later.
l'm getting another call.

1094
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:40,953
Are you Sandhya's nominee?

1095
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:44,282
She has taken an insurance policy.
lt got rejected.

1096
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:46,290
Because in her master
health checkup,

1097
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,554
l found that she has Lobular casrimo.

1098
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:51,598
Pay Rs. 5 lakhs immediately
and get her admitted.

1099
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,028
She must get operated.

1100
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:57,666
l don't understand.
lt's not serious, is it?

1101
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:01,899
Take a decision soon.

1102
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:22,895
Better get a second opinion
from some other doctor.

1103
01:18:25,934 --> 01:18:35,900
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

1104
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:52,591
Uncle...
- What happened sir?

1105
01:18:52,828 --> 01:18:54,193
Where is my uncle?
- Please sit.

1106
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,455
Where is my uncle?
- He is giving treatment.

1107
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:57,188
He will be here in 10 minutes.

1108
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:00,368
Go call him.
- Please sit.

1109
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:27,322
Uday, this is cancer.

1110
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,223
But you don't need to worry.

1111
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:35,232
This cancer is very common
among women.

1112
01:19:35,637 --> 01:19:38,299
lt's because of their
stress level & pressures.

1113
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:40,906
Leave the reports here.

1114
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:42,838
l will study the reports in detail.

1115
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:46,942
You don't worry.
l will take care.

1116
01:19:47,749 --> 01:19:49,512
Yes, it is true that
l started to come to beach.

1117
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:51,345
But l got late on the way.

1118
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:54,147
lt's not about that.
lt is something else.

1119
01:19:56,925 --> 01:20:00,224
l've been saying sorry since yesterday.

1120
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:01,793
Getting so angry is not fair.

1121
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:12,997
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

1122
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:24,644
l've been whistling but
you never looked at me.

1123
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:28,482
l'm not young.
- So, you understood it that way.

1124
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:30,851
Who is at home?
- No one.

1125
01:20:31,059 --> 01:20:33,823
Where did they go?
- Uday went to office.

1126
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:37,260
Sandhya went to his office
to meet him.

1127
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:42,035
lf she sees Uday as the MD
of the company, he's finished.

1128
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:47,141
Pick up the phone.

1129
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:51,643
Pick up the phone.

1130
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,179
MD would kill me if he finds
dust on his photo.

1131
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:56,341
What?

1132
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:01,745
What are you doing here?
- l want to talk to you.

1133
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:03,015
Can we go to the restaurant?

1134
01:21:04,092 --> 01:21:04,956
Restaurant?

1135
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:06,651
Let's go.

1136
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:08,022
Won't you take permission?

1137
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:15,464
To take leave from office the other day,
you killed her, right?

1138
01:21:18,106 --> 01:21:21,439
Lunch?
Restaurant?

1139
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,367
Just because l'm staying in
your house as a paying guest,

1140
01:21:23,578 --> 01:21:25,478
doesn't mean l will come
wherever you call me.

1141
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:28,047
l thought you would say this.

1142
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,775
But you agreed the moment
l asked you to come.

1143
01:21:31,219 --> 01:21:34,450
Hyderabad boys are...
- Will you be quiet?

1144
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:37,684
Okay. l will be quiet.
Can you be quiet?

1145
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:42,358
The one who talks first is the loser.

1146
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:04,475
l won.

1147
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:17,018
You lost.

1148
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:38,676
No matter how much it may cost.

1149
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:40,305
Let's take her abroad.

1150
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:44,679
Just do something uncle.

1151
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:50,954
Uday, she fasts almost every day.

1152
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:53,660
She fainted now because of that.

1153
01:23:55,897 --> 01:23:57,159
Just relax.

1154
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:01,634
Why should she get this disease?

1155
01:24:04,606 --> 01:24:06,198
Do you know how disciplined she is?

1156
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:08,174
She doesn't eatjunk food.

1157
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:09,977
She is very careful.

1158
01:24:11,179 --> 01:24:13,306
She offered prayers to God,
she fasts...but why her?

1159
01:24:14,349 --> 01:24:17,546
l am not disciplined.
l eat all junk food.

1160
01:24:17,752 --> 01:24:18,912
God should've given me the disease.

1161
01:24:20,922 --> 01:24:23,755
Apart from house & college,
she knows nothing.

1162
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:26,689
She is saving every penny
for her future.

1163
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:29,896
She hasn't seen anything in life.

1164
01:24:30,765 --> 01:24:32,062
Then, you show her.

1165
01:24:32,534 --> 01:24:33,558
Take her with you.

1166
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:36,236
Show her everything
she wants to see.

1167
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:37,969
Fulfill all her wishes.

1168
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:41,131
lntroduce her to happiness & joy.

1169
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:45,371
Uday, happiness is the
best medication.

1170
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:52,342
She fainted the moment
she saw blood in her hand.

1171
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:54,952
lf she knows this...
- Don't tell her.

1172
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:58,123
Give her this medicine regularly.
Tell her this is for strength.

1173
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:02,090
What did the doctor say?

1174
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:12,834
He said that you will die in a week.

1175
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:15,840
Me too.

1176
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:19,310
Tell me what you
want to do this week.

1177
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:20,378
Let's do it.

1178
01:25:27,422 --> 01:25:28,184
Tell me.

1179
01:25:29,991 --> 01:25:30,821
l want to smoke cigarette.

1180
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:34,290
To watch Pavan Kalyan movie,
first day first show.

1181
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:37,056
To enjoy the thrill of stealing.

1182
01:25:38,833 --> 01:25:39,959
A small one.

1183
01:25:43,204 --> 01:25:44,466
l want to board an helicopter.

1184
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:47,798
You must carry me from
the gate to the house.

1185
01:25:49,911 --> 01:25:50,707
What?

1186
01:25:51,779 --> 01:25:53,838
Nothing.
These are very little ones.

1187
01:25:55,383 --> 01:25:56,680
Don't you want to go somewhere?

1188
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:02,253
l want to be in 2 places
at the same time.

1189
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:05,119
Can you make it possible?
- Just one place.

1190
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:06,654
Nothing like that.

1191
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:10,797
l want to go to Kasi.

1192
01:26:12,133 --> 01:26:15,967
l wish to immerse my parents
ashes in river Ganges.

1193
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:20,864
But not now.
l will go there when l am 60.

1194
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,170
No. We will go now.
l will take you there.

1195
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:26,711
Actually, l am saving money for that.

1196
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:27,973
l have to go there with that money.

1197
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:30,151
Without any planning.

1198
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:32,451
l will take you there as you wish.

1199
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:34,246
l will take you there with
that money. Let's go.

1200
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:35,615
That's not enough.

1201
01:26:35,823 --> 01:26:38,018
l will take you.
Trust me & come with me.

1202
01:26:38,893 --> 01:26:40,155
Get ready. Let's go.

1203
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:45,695
Shall we go?

1204
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:50,667
My Grandma says only luck
will take you to Kasi.

1205
01:26:51,272 --> 01:26:53,832
Kasi & my family don't go too well.

1206
01:26:56,177 --> 01:27:00,807
After my grandfather's death, my parents
went to Kasi to immerse his ashes.

1207
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:03,384
But they both died in
an accident.

1208
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:10,187
My grandmother booked train
ticket to immerse ashes of all three.

1209
01:27:11,259 --> 01:27:14,751
Her health deteriorated
a day before herjourney.

1210
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:16,795
And she could not go there.

1211
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:19,330
Now the responsibility is on me.

1212
01:27:20,435 --> 01:27:23,802
But l wonder what would happen
to me before reaching Kasi.

1213
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:33,775
Are we going in a ship?

1214
01:27:34,482 --> 01:27:36,916
This is the cheapest & best way
to travel to Calcutta.

1215
01:27:37,385 --> 01:27:38,579
But it would take 3 days
to reach there.

1216
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:41,584
From there, we can go
to Kasi by train in 12 hours.

1217
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:44,622
This is for food.
This is for travel. Take it.

1218
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:46,487
You can't even buy peanuts
with that money.

1219
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:48,992
l am telling you once more.

1220
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:51,529
Use only this money for travelling.
lt's a vow.

1221
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:52,722
l will take care.

1222
01:27:54,135 --> 01:27:56,228
Why did you bring me here?
- Hold this.

1223
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:58,462
People who travel by ship
are of two types.

1224
01:27:58,673 --> 01:28:00,868
Those who enjoy theirjourney
are one type.

1225
01:28:01,075 --> 01:28:03,873
Those who fear what would happen
to the ship are the second type.

1226
01:28:04,078 --> 01:28:06,603
People of the second type
always have the fear of death.

1227
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:08,372
We must cash in their fear.

1228
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:09,942
Now look at that girl.

1229
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:11,550
For sure she is scared.

1230
01:28:11,753 --> 01:28:14,051
She is Sandhya.
Poor girl. Her policy got rejected.

1231
01:28:14,255 --> 01:28:15,483
l don't know whether
she knows the reason or not.

1232
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:16,782
l will go & tell her.

1233
01:28:23,965 --> 01:28:25,193
What is he doing here?

1234
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:48,313
Why are you tensed?

1235
01:28:49,223 --> 01:28:51,020
Looks like there will be a cyclone.
Let's board the ship fast.

1236
01:28:51,225 --> 01:28:52,021
Oh my God!

1237
01:28:54,562 --> 01:29:04,528
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

1238
01:29:17,752 --> 01:29:19,583
Seat numbers with 2 or 3 is better.

1239
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:22,412
Please stop it, Sandhya.

1240
01:29:25,393 --> 01:29:27,418
What do you want?
- This seat...

1241
01:29:27,995 --> 01:29:28,791
Belongs to the ship owner.

1242
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:31,260
For the time being,
this belongs to Layout Lingaraju.

1243
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:35,202
l'm capable of selling one plot
to 50 people.

1244
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:37,264
Mine is 39.

1245
01:29:37,638 --> 01:29:40,471
You look very young.
Old age at young!

1246
01:29:41,109 --> 01:29:42,736
lt's my seat number not my age.

1247
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:46,408
Will you give me No: 2
and switch over to 39.

1248
01:29:46,614 --> 01:29:49,310
We believe in numerology.
- Vastu is my life.

1249
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:50,848
This is north east corner bed.

1250
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:53,816
l won't give you this seat even
if you give me 50% commission.

1251
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:58,492
Earlier, l switched my seats
without caring about Vastu.

1252
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,853
My life changed.
- How?

1253
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:03,658
When l & my wife were
travelling in an auto,

1254
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:08,429
Auto driver was ogling at my wife
in the rear view mirror.

1255
01:30:08,636 --> 01:30:11,332
ln your presence?
- That's why l got furious.

1256
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:12,631
Did you beat him?

1257
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:14,503
l beat him with brain.
- How?

1258
01:30:14,709 --> 01:30:16,904
l ensured he didn't ogle her
in the mirror.- How?

1259
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:19,944
l gave my seat to him and
shifted myself to his seat.

1260
01:30:21,482 --> 01:30:26,749
A seat change changed my fate.
- No sir, please...

1261
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:30,949
Never play with vastu,
you'll get busted.

1262
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:35,719
Okay, let's go and try there.

1263
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:41,394
Heart attack? Where?
To heart!

1264
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:43,297
Okay, call me after
he's dead, cut it now.

1265
01:30:43,838 --> 01:30:44,702
What happened?

1266
01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:48,706
l want seat number 3.

1267
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:54,146
lnfact l got 30 marks in numerology.

1268
01:30:54,348 --> 01:30:55,645
Numerology in 10th class?

1269
01:30:55,850 --> 01:30:58,944
l mean dealing with flowers
and plants.- That's biology.

1270
01:30:59,153 --> 01:31:00,711
How about maps and locations?

1271
01:31:02,356 --> 01:31:07,555
Oh no! Without knowing all this l've
become a big broker in real estate.

1272
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:08,956
Are you doing real estate?

1273
01:31:19,273 --> 01:31:21,036
Die your death yourself.

1274
01:31:27,782 --> 01:31:28,908
l think it's not possible.

1275
01:31:38,793 --> 01:31:42,752
l think that superstition man and
this broker boy have a connection.

1276
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:44,756
l can get the seats using it.

1277
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:46,661
Let's get fresh and go on deck.

1278
01:31:50,905 --> 01:31:52,839
Look at the girl,
she's perfect match to you.

1279
01:31:54,809 --> 01:31:55,776
She's already married.

1280
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:59,868
l've been watching her for long,
l couldn't observe it,

1281
01:32:00,448 --> 01:32:02,439
how could you tell
by just a glance?

1282
01:32:04,118 --> 01:32:06,552
ln that short time,
you could've seen her face only...

1283
01:32:06,754 --> 01:32:08,688
She's not sporting dot
on forehead also...

1284
01:32:08,923 --> 01:32:09,947
Sacred thread! You...

1285
01:32:10,157 --> 01:32:12,455
Oh no! l saw her legs.
l saw her wearing toe rings.

1286
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:17,226
Can't tell on seeing if a man
is married or not, right?

1287
01:32:19,166 --> 01:32:20,793
Like a collar to the domestic dog.

1288
01:32:21,002 --> 01:32:23,971
Women have to wear scared thread,
dot and toe rings.

1289
01:32:26,741 --> 01:32:28,800
Toe rings were once worn by men only!
- ls it?

1290
01:32:29,744 --> 01:32:35,307
Women used to bow head on facing men,
they can legs of men, right?

1291
01:32:35,516 --> 01:32:36,813
lf he's wearing toe rings,
it means he's married,

1292
01:32:37,018 --> 01:32:38,042
so she can drop out.

1293
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:41,480
Scared thread is fixed in the place
where generally men see.

1294
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:44,651
Later on tradition changed and
women started wearing toe rings.

1295
01:32:45,626 --> 01:32:48,151
Where do men generally see?
- They see here...

1296
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:53,427
They see there, right?

1297
01:32:54,468 --> 01:32:56,993
lt means you too watched the
same place on her, right?

1298
01:32:58,773 --> 01:33:01,333
l said about men in general.
l saw her legs only.

1299
01:33:18,459 --> 01:33:21,189
Do you've x-ray vision?
How could you see her toe rings?

1300
01:33:22,496 --> 01:33:23,758
When l saw her,
she didn't have legs...

1301
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,094
She had legs, was wearing shoes...

1302
01:33:28,836 --> 01:33:38,802
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

1303
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:44,516
What are those papers, Uday?

1304
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:50,746
l've an acre lying waste
in the ship end. l want to sell it.

1305
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:53,086
Selling plot on ship?

1306
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:56,653
Don't they sell water as different ports?

1307
01:33:57,965 --> 01:33:59,592
Do you know they're putting
layouts on moon also?

1308
01:34:00,568 --> 01:34:02,593
To sell commercial space
on ship...

1309
01:34:04,405 --> 01:34:06,032
But the owner must agree, right?

1310
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:09,007
That's his idea only,
look, he gave me papers also.

1311
01:34:09,710 --> 01:34:15,671
l don't know how to proceed...
l feel l'm missing a big opportunity.

1312
01:34:21,789 --> 01:34:23,120
Boy, one bill!

1313
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:26,789
Boy, two bills!

1314
01:34:27,061 --> 01:34:29,029
Give it to him.
- Bloody!

1315
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:35,230
Poor man! He's struggling to free out
something stuck in thread.

1316
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:47,306
Why come suddenly to me?

1317
01:34:47,515 --> 01:34:51,918
l heard you talking about
land and documents.

1318
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:55,486
lf you give me the documents,
l'll sell it for you.

1319
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:56,987
l'm a poor boy!

1320
01:34:57,525 --> 01:34:59,220
l think he has fallen into the trap.
Take the papers.

1321
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:03,159
Ship is mine.

1322
01:35:05,866 --> 01:35:08,494
Paid the bill or washed plates there?
- You tortoise!

1323
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:10,500
Hey! Mind your tongue!

1324
01:35:10,871 --> 01:35:14,170
lf you call me names,
l'll drown you in the sea.

1325
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:21,345
l'm original and you're pirated CD.
Because l've the original documents.

1326
01:35:24,618 --> 01:35:27,849
Don't fly in dreams,
you'll float in the sea.

1327
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:30,523
Don'tjump like fish,
you'll get trapped in net.

1328
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:34,686
Don't boast,
let's see who sells it first.

1329
01:35:35,062 --> 01:35:38,190
First seller is great,
l'll prove l'm great.

1330
01:35:41,802 --> 01:35:44,202
Sambar is great!
- l'm great.

1331
01:35:46,841 --> 01:35:52,211
lf we leave something we love in river
Ganges, and make a wish, it will happen.

1332
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:53,714
What will you wish for?

1333
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:56,379
lf wishes have to come true,
you shouldn't reveal it.

1334
01:35:58,085 --> 01:36:01,714
Then, there's a trick for it.
For example, l love this watch.

1335
01:36:02,089 --> 01:36:03,647
And if l wish it rains now,

1336
01:36:04,024 --> 01:36:07,118
if l take out this watch,
and throw it in river Ganges,

1337
01:36:08,028 --> 01:36:11,156
and reverse my wish
like it shouldn't rain.

1338
01:36:11,365 --> 01:36:14,562
Now l'll tell you my wish,
so my wish will get fulfilled,

1339
01:36:14,835 --> 01:36:17,065
but it will rain as per
my real wish.

1340
01:36:19,607 --> 01:36:22,906
lt will be 100% successful.
l know you love your spectacles.

1341
01:36:23,177 --> 01:36:25,737
Throw it and do as l tell you.

1342
01:36:32,186 --> 01:36:34,746
Neither this is river Ganges
and nor this place is Kasi.

1343
01:36:34,955 --> 01:36:36,923
Why should l throw and
make a wish?

1344
01:36:40,294 --> 01:36:43,263
Don't you feel only we both
are in this world?

1345
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:54,607
l'm not selling this place.
- Did l ask you?

1346
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,936
Whether you ask or not,
l'm not selling it. Go!

1347
01:37:01,982 --> 01:37:04,450
Real estate has reached
waters from land.

1348
01:37:06,754 --> 01:37:07,778
How would you build on it?

1349
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:21,131
Come on...come on...Square feetjust
Rs.500 only, only few plots remain.

1350
01:37:23,237 --> 01:37:26,798
Airport on this side and railway station
on that side, ring road on the back side.

1351
01:37:30,177 --> 01:37:33,408
How?
- lt'll be circular!

1352
01:37:33,614 --> 01:37:34,740
Underground in water?!

1353
01:37:35,182 --> 01:37:40,085
Buy one plot! Whether Telengana state
comes or not rates will remain same.

1354
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:46,159
Buy one plot, 10 cars free.
Come!

1355
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:49,329
l didn't eat anything since morning,
l'm a poor little boy.

1356
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:50,326
Bloody!

1357
01:37:54,602 --> 01:37:56,763
Tomorrow is Lord Ganesh Chathurthi.
- ls it?

1358
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:03,508
Not wishes, l want an idol.
To offer prayers.

1359
01:38:05,212 --> 01:38:07,339
Maruthi will be perfect as Ganesh.

1360
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:10,847
lf l cut you into pieces
and throw into the sea,

1361
01:38:11,051 --> 01:38:12,177
fishes can feast for a month.

1362
01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:16,186
lf l crush you, you'll be enough
for my breakfast only.

1363
01:38:17,157 --> 01:38:18,784
They are fighting because of us.

1364
01:38:19,493 --> 01:38:21,859
Not because of us,
theirs is real estate problem.

1365
01:38:22,062 --> 01:38:23,791
But it got bigger because of us only.

1366
01:38:26,567 --> 01:38:30,867
Okay, let's celebrate it grandly
tomorrow and unite them.

1367
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:43,383
That's it!

1368
01:38:56,864 --> 01:38:58,297
Vegetable Ganesh!

1369
01:38:58,866 --> 01:39:00,959
Bless all of us here!

1370
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:14,137
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

1371
01:39:27,594 --> 01:39:35,899
Never expected this world will
turn beautiful for me...

1372
01:39:36,270 --> 01:39:44,473
l'm seeing many alluring colours
in this celebration...

1373
01:39:45,112 --> 01:39:49,173
May l think this reality
as dream...

1374
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:53,352
l can't believe if anyone
says it's true...

1375
01:39:53,554 --> 01:40:02,360
l was lifeless statue among people...
l've become a wave in the mid sea...

1376
01:40:17,244 --> 01:40:27,210
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

1377
01:40:54,681 --> 01:41:02,986
Won't the mischievous rainbow on sky
take colours from my smiles?

1378
01:41:03,357 --> 01:41:11,992
Won't the jumping fishes in sea
make a wish for my speed?

1379
01:41:12,433 --> 01:41:16,529
Let my surging thoughts
go on high seas...

1380
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:21,106
Won't it beat the speeding
ships hands down?

1381
01:41:21,241 --> 01:41:29,649
Clouds got scared of me and
falling down as rain drops...

1382
01:41:30,350 --> 01:41:38,587

This journey is going on smoothly...
Will it show me wonders at every turn?

1386
01:42:39,853 --> 01:42:48,090
Has that friendship become
a support of my life now?

1387
01:42:48,562 --> 01:42:57,266
Has this relationship taught
my mute heart to sing songs?

1388
01:42:57,804 --> 01:43:02,104
Let the wish get fulfilled...
Let me reach the shore...

1389
01:43:02,309 --> 01:43:05,938

Once dropped, the game is over.

She respects you a lot.

Respect? No, fear.
She shivers on seeing me.

1454
01:49:57,724 --> 01:50:00,022
Put my slippers correctly.

1455
01:50:01,328 --> 01:50:02,852
Didn't l tell you to remind me

Hey girl! Did you ask her my name?

My name is Sandhya, he's Uday.

1464
01:50:29,189 --> 01:50:31,214
Why are you calling your
future husband by his name?

He took me on ship, chariot, now train.

01:50:44,004 --> 01:50:48,907
Before l reach Kasi, l told him to take me

1470
01:50:49,442 --> 01:50:51,410
That's all, right?

He touched me.

1517

l beat him black and blue
for daring to touch me.

1518
01:53:22,762 --> 01:53:26,892
That Koti ruined my life,
otherwise l would be very happy.

1519
01:53:27,100 --> 01:53:27,896
Who is he?

1520
01:53:29,002 --> 01:53:30,401
You can see him loitering
in this train.

1521
01:53:30,603 --> 01:53:31,399
Come, l'll show him to you.

1522

My blood raced...
l pounced on them like a lion.

1528
01:53:50,890 --> 01:53:54,257

Stop with your doubts, what's this?

1532
01:54:10,977 --> 01:54:13,946
How dare you slap me

Don't l follow rules then?

1541
01:54:31,598 --> 01:54:32,792

01:54:46,746 --> 01:54:47,474
What's all this?

1547
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,977
This is marijuana's effect.
- ls it?

1548
01:54:49,182 --> 01:54:50,809
She'll be like that till
the effect cools off.

1549
01:54:59,225 --> 01:55:03,719
What is my name?

1550
01:55:03,863 --> 01:55:07,492
Your name...l can't utter it.

1551
01:55:08,534 --> 01:55:12,493
Thank God! She's normal!
Come, let's play cards.

1552
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:15,837
Don't you remember
what you did just now, grandma?

1553
01:55:16,042 --> 01:55:17,009
l remember everything clearly.

1554
01:55:17,210 --> 01:55:19,678
l covered up lest it may
hurt Koti's ego.

1555
01:55:20,046 --> 01:55:22,014
You climbed the train top,
didn't you get scared?

1556
01:55:22,215 --> 01:55:24,683
l spent all these years
in fear within home.

1557
01:55:24,884 --> 01:55:27,682
After seeing you, l realised
what l had lost in my life.

1558
01:55:28,221 --> 01:55:29,347
Now l'm peaceful.

1559
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:32,687
l asked him all that
l couldn't ask in 70 years.

1560
01:55:32,892 --> 01:55:34,689
l did all the mischief
l never did earlier.

1561
01:55:34,894 --> 01:55:39,194
You're very lucky, got yourself a man
who does whatever you ask.

1562
01:55:39,465 --> 01:55:41,865
l brought it to this stage
by postponing things.

1563
01:55:43,236 --> 01:55:44,703
May you be blessed
with all happiness.

1564
01:55:47,907 --> 01:55:49,704
My place has come,
pull the chain.

1565
01:55:51,411 --> 01:55:52,207
Get down quickly.

1566
01:55:56,916 --> 01:56:00,215
lt happens only in Bihar,
they get down by pulling the chain.

1567
01:56:00,486 --> 01:56:03,387
l want to board train.
- We already have.

1568
01:56:03,589 --> 01:56:04,715
l mean train top.

1569
01:56:05,425 --> 01:56:06,551
Are you mad?

1570
01:56:06,826 --> 01:56:08,054
Grandma too climbed the roof.

1571
01:56:08,594 --> 01:56:09,561
That's quite different.

1572
01:56:09,762 --> 01:56:10,888
Will you take me or not?

1573
01:56:18,604 --> 01:56:20,572
Why do you always call me as Oye?

1574
01:56:21,107 --> 01:56:22,734
l don't know, don't you like it?

1575
01:56:25,945 --> 01:56:28,243
My mother used to call
my dad like that only. - ls it?

1576
01:56:29,615 --> 01:56:32,413
Hey who is up there? Get down.

1577
01:56:35,054 --> 01:56:36,248
What were you doing up there?

1578
01:56:36,522 --> 01:56:39,252
Up there...this girl...
- No need to explain, come to station.

1579
01:56:39,525 --> 01:56:40,583
Police station?
- Yes.

1580
01:56:41,627 --> 01:56:44,255
Arjun, Karthik, come down,
police are here.

1581
01:56:44,530 --> 01:56:46,430
Who else is up there?
- Who are they?

1582
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:50,268
ls it your train? Get down!

1583
01:56:50,636 --> 01:56:54,094
Difficult...very difficult to reach Kasi.

1584
01:56:54,974 --> 01:56:59,104
We'll definitely reach Kasi.
lt may be just 300 kms away from here.

1585
01:56:59,312 --> 01:57:01,109
We can travel easily by road. Come.

1586
01:57:08,988 --> 01:57:11,115
Sir...where is the nearest bus stop?

1587
01:57:11,324 --> 01:57:12,951
Thank you...thank you very much...

1588
01:57:16,329 --> 01:57:20,288
Bodh Gaya is nearby, it's the place
where Buddha attained salvation.

1589
01:57:20,700 --> 01:57:22,964
Let's go pray to over come
this difficulty.

1590
01:57:23,169 --> 01:57:26,468
Going to that place is difficulty,
can't reach Kasi if we go there. No.

1591
01:57:27,907 --> 01:57:29,636
You're not fulfilling any of my wishes.

1592
01:57:42,355 --> 01:57:43,151
For me?

1593
01:57:44,023 --> 01:57:44,990
Give me a match stick.

1594
01:57:47,527 --> 01:57:49,495
lt seems.

1595
01:57:51,597 --> 01:57:53,497
We don't need cigarettes.

1596
01:57:58,704 --> 01:58:00,501
ls the temple this side?
- Yes.

1597
01:58:10,716 --> 01:58:15,346
Coming here with questions...

1598
01:58:15,621 --> 01:58:20,183
Heart gives the answers...

1599
01:58:20,726 --> 01:58:25,356
l offer prayers to you...

1600
01:58:25,631 --> 01:58:30,534
Bless our lives with your grace...

1601
01:58:30,736 --> 01:58:35,196
l've come seeking to your place...

1602
01:58:35,741 --> 01:58:40,371
Take my boat to the other side...

1603
01:58:40,646 --> 01:58:45,549
O most merciful lord...

1604
01:58:50,723 --> 01:59:00,189
First time my heart is seeking
your divine blessings...

1605
01:59:00,766 --> 01:59:05,396
Let wishes sprout...

1606
01:59:05,671 --> 01:59:10,734
Take me with you to your path...

1607
01:59:10,943 --> 01:59:15,903
Keep my love afloat...

1608
01:59:23,956 --> 01:59:26,254
Now l feel only we both are in
this world as you said once.

1609
01:59:26,792 --> 01:59:27,759
ls it?

1610
01:59:28,961 --> 01:59:31,088
God! Please don't do it.

1611
01:59:31,297 --> 01:59:34,425
See that there's atleast
one man to give us lift.

1612
01:59:34,700 --> 01:59:38,101
Please God!
Just one man is enough.

1613
01:59:38,371 --> 01:59:39,099
Please God!

1614
01:59:52,652 --> 01:59:55,621
Ras Bihari! Lion of Bihar.

1615
01:59:55,821 --> 01:59:59,120
Please don't stare at me sir...
flat tyre wasn't because of me sir.

1616
01:59:59,325 --> 02:00:01,452
Want to change the tyre,
can you help me?

1617
02:00:01,827 --> 02:00:03,454
Certainly, do you know to
speak in Telugu?

1618
02:00:08,334 --> 02:00:10,461
Where are you going?
- To Kasi.

1619
02:00:11,938 --> 02:00:14,133
lf it's fine, you can come with me.

1620
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:15,136
lt's okay to us.

1621
02:00:25,751 --> 02:00:28,311
Push the jeep to start.

1622
02:00:30,356 --> 02:00:31,152
Push.

1623
02:00:32,692 --> 02:00:35,820
Will it start?
- Push further and it'll start.

1624
02:00:36,028 --> 02:00:37,325
lt has started.

1625
02:00:38,698 --> 02:00:41,997
l've seen you somewhere.
Where...?

1626
02:00:42,201 --> 02:00:43,828
l used to live in Vizag.

1627
02:00:44,704 --> 02:00:45,500
Now l remember.

1628
02:00:45,871 --> 02:00:48,669
You ran away after beaten up
by Chatrapathy, right?

1629
02:00:49,041 --> 02:00:52,169
Don't utter his name.
lt makes me angry.- That's it!

1630
02:00:52,378 --> 02:00:54,505
Once up on a time
l was big goon in Vizag.

1631
02:00:54,780 --> 02:00:58,682
lf Chatrapathy hadn't come there.
l would be Vizag's King.

1632
02:01:00,720 --> 02:01:02,187
Something is moving in the bag.

1633
02:01:08,894 --> 02:01:11,522
Wild boar, l must deliver it in Sasaram.
- Boar?

1634
02:01:11,797 --> 02:01:13,355
Can you give a little push?
- Again?

1635
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:23,697
You watch the road,
we'll take care of the boar.

1636
02:01:25,578 --> 02:01:28,706
Will you shut up or not, you wild boar?

1637
02:01:29,081 --> 02:01:30,548
Why boar?

1638
02:01:31,083 --> 02:01:33,551
What would you call a boar
if not a boar?

1639
02:01:36,822 --> 02:01:39,552
l think it's very stubborn,
you too give it a thrashing.

1640
02:01:42,161 --> 02:01:44,391
Not like that, give it to me,
l'll thrash it.

1641
02:01:45,598 --> 02:01:46,724
Thrash like this!

1642
02:01:57,610 --> 02:01:59,407
Stay here, l'll deliver it and come.

1643
02:02:08,287 --> 02:02:09,754
lt's really great this jeep
came up to here.

1644
02:02:15,127 --> 02:02:16,094
What happened?

1645
02:02:19,065 --> 02:02:20,760
l'm ruined!

1646
02:02:20,966 --> 02:02:23,264
Why? Did they refuse the boar?

1647
02:02:23,469 --> 02:02:25,437
lt's not a boar but a man.

1648
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:28,436
l had him kidnapped from Vizag.

1649
02:02:29,809 --> 02:02:35,111
l did one last crime to make money
and start a new leaf.

1650
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:39,277
l spent the money l had
for this kidnap.

1651
02:02:40,019 --> 02:02:42,783
But my people picked up
the wrong person.

1652
02:02:43,989 --> 02:02:48,289
Ruined...l'm totally ruined...

1653
02:02:51,163 --> 02:02:53,791
Please don't cry boss.
You'll get something.

1654
02:02:54,033 --> 02:02:54,795
No way.

1655
02:02:55,334 --> 02:03:00,294
lf you take a holy dip in river Ganges,
you'll get back all your lost money.

1656
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:02,468
ls it? Will l get it back really?

1657
02:03:03,342 --> 02:03:03,967
Come with us.

1658
02:03:10,249 --> 02:03:11,477
l'll also go to loo.

1659
02:03:19,125 --> 02:03:21,821
Bag is moving, what should l do now?

1660
02:03:22,027 --> 02:03:24,154
Don't you think it's better to let off
the wrongly held boar?

1661
02:03:25,531 --> 02:03:26,156
Okay.

1662
02:03:26,866 --> 02:03:27,833
Open the bag.

1663
02:03:33,873 --> 02:03:35,670
Abhishek? What are you doing here?

1664
02:03:38,711 --> 02:03:41,839
l didn't get any call from you,
what happened to my policy?

1665
02:03:44,150 --> 02:03:45,845
Tell me, what happened to my policy?

1666
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:58,690
Anjali...Anjali...
glowing beautiful moon...

1667
02:04:04,570 --> 02:04:05,537
Who are you?

1668
02:04:06,238 --> 02:04:11,369
l think you hit him seriously to
make him forget the past.

1669
02:04:11,577 --> 02:04:12,373
What should we do now?

1670
02:04:12,578 --> 02:04:14,045
Let's take him with us. Come.

1671
02:04:14,580 --> 02:04:16,207
Come dear, let's push the vehicle.

1672
02:04:16,415 --> 02:04:17,382
Okay uncle.

1673
02:04:17,750 --> 02:04:20,719
No headlights, let's spend night in
roadside eatery and leave by morning.

1674
02:04:20,986 --> 02:04:22,385
What about my school?
- l'll send a leave letter.

1675
02:04:22,588 --> 02:04:23,384
Do you to know to write?

1676
02:04:33,432 --> 02:04:34,228
Wake up!

1677
02:04:35,768 --> 02:04:39,067
l want that!
- Shut up!

1678
02:04:39,605 --> 02:04:41,732
l want that thing!

1679
02:04:42,775 --> 02:04:45,744
Sleeveless uncle, l want that thing.

1680
02:04:46,011 --> 02:04:46,739
Take it.

1681
02:04:48,714 --> 02:04:58,680
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

1682
02:05:11,303 --> 02:05:14,272
Why is radio so small, uncle?

1683
02:05:33,659 --> 02:05:36,628
Abhishek! l'll shake you up!

1684
02:05:37,663 --> 02:05:39,290
Are you trying to steal my phone?

1685
02:05:40,332 --> 02:05:42,630
Somebody kidnapped me,
they tied me in a sack,

1686
02:05:42,835 --> 02:05:44,632
l was shaking for long time,

1687
02:05:44,837 --> 02:05:46,304
two people punched me
from two sides,

1688
02:05:46,505 --> 02:05:47,301
they put a heavy thing on my head,

1689
02:05:48,073 --> 02:05:49,802
they carried and dumped me
in another place,

1690
02:05:50,175 --> 02:05:50,800
then they threw me away.

1691
02:05:52,678 --> 02:05:54,475
stones hurt my back.

1692
02:05:54,680 --> 02:05:56,307
The problems started from shipyard.

1693
02:05:56,515 --> 02:05:58,483
lt started when l searched
for someone.

1694
02:05:58,684 --> 02:06:03,144
Who was l searching?

1695
02:06:05,190 --> 02:06:06,657
Lassi is very good, try it.

1696
02:06:07,860 --> 02:06:08,656
For her only!

1697
02:06:08,861 --> 02:06:10,328
l must tell her the
real matter immediately.

1698
02:06:12,698 --> 02:06:13,164
Madam...

1699
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:17,669
l came to harbour that day
to tell you something.

1700
02:06:17,870 --> 02:06:19,838
What actually had happened was...
your policy...

1701
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:21,836
Tell me!

1702
02:06:22,875 --> 02:06:24,001
What happened to my policy?

1703
02:06:31,450 --> 02:06:33,850
Poor man got thrashed seriously.

1704
02:06:34,119 --> 02:06:34,847
Mind is blocked.

1705
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:36,178
Go and sleep dear.

1706
02:06:38,724 --> 02:06:39,520
You come.

1707
02:06:43,562 --> 02:06:45,359
Hey please get me that rabbit.

1708
02:06:45,598 --> 02:06:47,031
What will you do with it?
- l'll play with it.

1709
02:06:48,233 --> 02:06:50,861
lf l catch it,
Blue Cross will play with us.

1710
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:55,869
Lord Rama went for the golden deer without
any questions when Sita asked for it.

1711
02:06:56,141 --> 02:06:57,540
That's real love.

1712
02:06:58,744 --> 02:07:00,871
But demon Ravana appeared after that.

1713
02:07:01,146 --> 02:07:02,704
He kidnapped Sita.

1714
02:07:02,915 --> 02:07:03,882
A severe war was waged.

1715
02:07:04,283 --> 02:07:06,046
lt's always a war with you.

1716
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:08,219
You play with words very well.

1717
02:07:10,923 --> 02:07:12,390
Come...come...

1718
02:07:13,092 --> 02:07:13,888
Come l say!

1719
02:07:17,596 --> 02:07:18,893
What happened to you suddenly?

1720
02:07:38,951 --> 02:07:41,579
You wanted to be in two places
at the same time.

1721
02:07:41,987 --> 02:07:45,081
You're now in UP and Bihar.
Two states.

1722
02:07:58,537 --> 02:08:03,167
Can you bring the moon to me?

1723
02:08:03,375 --> 02:08:07,835
Can you make multicoloured
parrot to say l love you?

1724
02:08:08,113 --> 02:08:12,846
Can you carry clouds
piggy back and run?

1725
02:08:13,118 --> 02:08:17,350
Can you stand upstraight
in 100 feet water?

1726
02:08:17,556 --> 02:08:26,692
When many wishes like this start
in my heart and reach you...

1727
02:08:26,899 --> 02:08:36,365
lf l make a wish,
without any delay you'll fulfill it...

1728
02:08:36,742 --> 02:08:41,372
l made you my love...

1729
02:08:41,747 --> 02:08:45,706
Can't l fulfill your wishes?

1730
02:08:46,418 --> 02:08:50,878
l'm turning into your love...

1731
02:08:51,423 --> 02:08:55,382
Can't l touch the zenith of happiness?

1732
02:08:57,863 --> 02:09:07,829
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

1733
02:09:24,790 --> 02:09:29,591
Weave a sari with tender leaves...

1734
02:09:29,795 --> 02:09:34,198
Present it to me...

1735
02:09:34,399 --> 02:09:43,933
Shall l design the border with my eyes
and present it to you?

1736
02:09:44,143 --> 02:09:53,609
Whatever you may ask, love is that
which gives more than what you ask...

1737
02:09:53,819 --> 02:10:00,782
Will you colour my dreams?

1738
02:10:27,953 --> 02:10:37,919
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

1739
02:11:40,859 --> 02:11:41,325
Come...

1740
02:11:42,861 --> 02:11:44,158
Come quickly...

1741
02:11:46,198 --> 02:11:46,823
Come...come...

1742
02:11:51,203 --> 02:11:53,831
Tell me why are you laughing?

1743
02:11:54,039 --> 02:11:57,998
We don't have money to pay the eatery,
that's why we are escaping.

1744
02:11:58,210 --> 02:11:59,677
l'll also jump.

1745
02:11:59,878 --> 02:12:01,345
Eatery owner is no ordinary man.

1746
02:12:01,613 --> 02:12:02,841
He'll gun down us.

1747
02:12:03,215 --> 02:12:06,013
Krishna, they are running away
without paying me.

1748
02:12:06,218 --> 02:12:07,344
Catch them!
- Escape!

1749
02:12:11,890 --> 02:12:12,515
Go fast.

1750
02:12:19,064 --> 02:12:20,531
Stop...you thief!

1751
02:12:21,066 --> 02:12:23,193
Go fast...
- They are catching up.

1752
02:12:23,402 --> 02:12:24,198
Faster...

1753
02:12:26,638 --> 02:12:27,696
Fast!

1754
02:12:31,243 --> 02:12:31,868
Faster!

1755
02:12:38,250 --> 02:12:39,046
Come...come...

1756
02:12:43,188 --> 02:12:53,154
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

1757
02:12:58,770 --> 02:12:59,395
Watch out!

1758
02:13:19,291 --> 02:13:20,918
Come inside!

1759
02:13:53,992 --> 02:13:55,118
When did this uncle got in?

1760
02:13:56,995 --> 02:13:57,962
l'll check.

1761
02:14:02,167 --> 02:14:02,963
Scarecrow!

1762
02:14:03,668 --> 02:14:04,464
Scarecrow?

1763
02:14:09,341 --> 02:14:11,309
l'll play with uncle.
- Go and sit inside.

1764
02:14:11,743 --> 02:14:12,801
l really got scared.

1765
02:14:13,745 --> 02:14:16,976
l thought it'll be thrilling to steal.

1766
02:14:17,182 --> 02:14:20,481
For a moment l thought we got
involved in a murder case.

1767
02:14:22,354 --> 02:14:23,480
lt all happened because of him.

1768
02:14:28,226 --> 02:14:30,387
Hey money! Look here!

1769
02:14:30,529 --> 02:14:31,325
Money?

1770
02:14:33,365 --> 02:14:34,332
There's lot of money!

1771
02:14:37,869 --> 02:14:40,667
Somebody would've stashed
his black money here.

1772
02:14:41,206 --> 02:14:42,173
Luckily we got it.

1773
02:14:42,374 --> 02:14:44,842
We are going to Kasi, right?
That's why we got lucky.

1774
02:14:45,043 --> 02:14:45,668
Did you see?

1775
02:14:45,877 --> 02:14:47,344
Hail Lord Kasi Vishwanath!

1776
02:14:47,546 --> 02:14:48,513
What shall we do now?

1777
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:50,008
Let's share it equally.

1778
02:14:50,215 --> 02:14:52,012
This is yours, this is for you.

1779
02:14:52,217 --> 02:14:53,343
This is for you.

1780
02:14:53,552 --> 02:14:54,519
Rest is mine.

1781
02:14:54,786 --> 02:14:58,187
l'll start a business with it
and live honestly.

1782
02:14:58,390 --> 02:15:00,517
l'll buy chocolates and
ice creams with it.

1783
02:15:00,792 --> 02:15:01,690
You buy a shirt with this.

1784
02:15:01,893 --> 02:15:02,689
Buy shirt with sleeves, okay?

1785
02:15:04,229 --> 02:15:08,188
You'll waste it.
Let it be with me.

1786
02:15:10,569 --> 02:15:12,867
l can settle loan at one go.

1787
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:25,383
Why am l here?

1788
02:15:59,117 --> 02:16:01,585
l thought it was impossible
to come here in my life.

1789
02:16:01,853 --> 02:16:03,582
My responsibility is over.

1790
02:16:04,623 --> 02:16:06,090
Peace in heart.

1791
02:16:06,458 --> 02:16:07,925
You made it possible.

1792
02:16:09,461 --> 02:16:10,928
Thank you very much.

1793
02:16:12,297 --> 02:16:16,256
This is nothing, once you reach home,
it's happiness all the way.

1794
02:16:17,469 --> 02:16:21,098
But l don't travel back to
home in the same route.

1795
02:16:24,509 --> 02:16:27,307
How nice it would be
had we been birds!

1796
02:16:30,182 --> 02:16:32,150
Hail Lord Shiva!

1797
02:16:40,358 --> 02:16:42,986
You...?
- l got back my memory.

1798
02:16:44,029 --> 02:16:45,326
Don't worry.

1799
02:16:45,530 --> 02:16:47,157
l'll not tell her anything.

1800
02:16:47,866 --> 02:16:49,663
She's very happy because of you.

1801
02:16:51,036 --> 02:16:53,504
Your love is great!

1802
02:17:03,782 --> 02:17:05,010
Come, let's go.

1803
02:17:09,554 --> 02:17:10,680
Come, vehicle is here.

1804
02:17:18,230 --> 02:17:19,026
Where's the vehicle?

1805
02:17:25,237 --> 02:17:26,363
Helicopter?

1806
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:28,365
How did you arrange it?

1807
02:17:29,241 --> 02:17:30,538
Don't ask anything, come.

1808
02:17:31,076 --> 02:17:31,701
But...?

1809
02:17:33,245 --> 02:17:33,711
Get in.

1810
02:17:44,089 --> 02:17:45,056
What are you doing?

1811
02:17:45,590 --> 02:17:46,887
Not ours, right?

1812
02:17:48,260 --> 02:17:49,386
What about home loan?

1813
02:17:49,761 --> 02:17:52,059
Why to rush? Life is very long.

1814
02:18:02,507 --> 02:18:12,473
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

1815
02:18:20,292 --> 02:18:21,759
How did you do...

1816
02:18:39,311 --> 02:18:42,109
This time mom didn't come,
l brought them.

1817
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:45,779
Did you express your love
to sister or not, Uday?

1818
02:18:50,488 --> 02:18:54,288
Everybody knows here except me.

1819
02:18:56,161 --> 02:18:59,130
l expressed it to you on birthday,
they knew a day before.

1820
02:18:59,331 --> 02:19:01,458
Tell me the truth...
- l swear it's true.

1821
02:19:10,508 --> 02:19:11,304
ls your father at home?

1822
02:19:12,911 --> 02:19:14,310
l'm not here to fight.

1823
02:19:14,512 --> 02:19:14,978
Who is it?

1824
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:17,148
lt's me Sandhya, uncle.

1825
02:19:17,515 --> 02:19:21,144
We are grandly celebrating Christmas
tomorrow, all of you must come.

1826
02:19:21,686 --> 02:19:23,984
What? Party?
Are you throwing a party?

1827
02:19:25,924 --> 02:19:27,824
Yes, do come without fail.

1828
02:19:28,026 --> 02:19:30,995
l didn't attend function in your home,
for that you please don't avoid my party.

1829
02:19:31,196 --> 02:19:32,993
l'm arranging loud speakers,
you must make it.

1830
02:19:33,198 --> 02:19:33,823
We'll definitely make it.

1831
02:19:36,701 --> 02:19:38,498
How can Christmas be
celebrated without Santa?

1832
02:19:41,706 --> 02:19:42,331
How did you come Santa?

1833
02:19:42,540 --> 02:19:44,167
Buddy, it's me!

1834
02:19:49,547 --> 02:19:51,174
So...it was you...?

1835
02:19:56,221 --> 02:19:59,520
l'm very happy that
all of you made it.

1836
02:19:59,724 --> 02:20:03,524
Now l've understood what l missed
all these days.

1837
02:20:04,562 --> 02:20:07,190
l've understood the
value of celebrations.

1838
02:20:08,099 --> 02:20:09,691
Because of a good friend.

1839
02:20:13,238 --> 02:20:17,538
Please forgive me for the inconvenience
l had created for all of you.

1840
02:20:18,076 --> 02:20:22,376
Hereafter l'll celebrate
all the festivals with you.

1841
02:20:28,253 --> 02:20:29,345
Please come in.

1842
02:20:30,255 --> 02:20:32,883
lt's me, uncle.
- ls it you?

1843
02:20:38,663 --> 02:20:41,063
No problem, l'll come later.

1844
02:20:50,442 --> 02:20:52,910
What are you doing?
- Special item is getting ready.

1845
02:20:53,278 --> 02:20:54,404
l'm hungry.

1846
02:20:56,448 --> 02:20:57,574
l'm coming there.

1847
02:20:58,450 --> 02:20:59,246
Wait there only!

1848
02:21:17,469 --> 02:21:18,595
How is she?

1849
02:21:19,637 --> 02:21:22,265
Why...why uncle?

1850
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:26,599
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
- l couldn't. Just couldn't tell you.

1851
02:21:26,811 --> 02:21:29,609
What couldn't? Had you told me earlier,
l would've done something.

1852
02:21:29,981 --> 02:21:31,949
Trusting you...damn it!

1853
02:21:38,656 --> 02:21:42,956
No sunny...when the disease was
diagnosed it was advanced stage.

1854
02:21:43,161 --> 02:21:45,629
Already it had spread to chest cavity.

1855
02:21:46,498 --> 02:21:50,298
lt was stage that didn't respond to
chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

1856
02:21:50,502 --> 02:21:56,805
Even if was done, she would've lost hair,
weight and experienced physical torture,

1857
02:21:57,075 --> 02:21:57,632
but never get cured.

1858
02:21:57,842 --> 02:22:02,643
Why these hospitals and doctors
like you if you can't cure it?

1859
02:22:03,515 --> 02:22:06,575
Yes, indeed useless.

1860
02:22:08,186 --> 02:22:12,145
When your mother had
just 4 months of life,

1861
02:22:12,357 --> 02:22:16,487
l tried all my best to save her,

1862
02:22:16,861 --> 02:22:22,493
with different treatments we forced her to
spend those few days also in hospital.

1863
02:22:23,535 --> 02:22:29,496
lt would've been better if we had asked
what she'd like to do in those 4 months.

1864
02:22:30,542 --> 02:22:34,672
l didn't want to make the same
mistake with Sandhya.

1865
02:23:11,249 --> 02:23:12,716
What happened to sister, Uday?

1866
02:23:15,420 --> 02:23:16,546
Nothing.

1867
02:23:17,155 --> 02:23:20,556
We had travelled a lot in 10 days,
so she's down with a viral fever.

1868
02:23:20,758 --> 02:23:22,385
Doctor has advised rest.

1869
02:23:22,927 --> 02:23:25,725
Uncle is in that room, wait there.

1870
02:23:37,108 --> 02:23:42,910
ls shadow leaving me?

1871
02:23:43,948 --> 02:23:50,581
ls vision leaving my eye?

1872
02:23:50,788 --> 02:23:56,920
Night is falling at dawn...

1873
02:23:57,795 --> 02:24:03,597
Dawn is enveloped in darkness...

1874
02:24:03,968 --> 02:24:10,430
l'm bringing my heart as
a sweet memory to you...

1875
02:24:10,642 --> 02:24:17,605
The time l spent with you,
is it going to become past?

1876
02:24:17,982 --> 02:24:24,114
lf you're there, l'm there,
O my love...

1877
02:24:24,656 --> 02:24:31,118
Don't go away, my love...

1878
02:24:32,897 --> 02:24:42,863
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

1879
02:24:51,849 --> 02:24:58,482
All these days my legs
followed you...

1880
02:24:58,856 --> 02:25:05,159
lt's asking me now,
where are the footprints that l followed?

1881
02:25:05,463 --> 02:25:18,501
You were in my eyes, today it is asking
why is it empty without you?

1882
02:25:19,377 --> 02:25:26,010
The life l longed was about
to be mine...

1883
02:25:26,384 --> 02:25:33,347
But merciless fate cursed my life...

1884
02:25:33,725 --> 02:25:40,358
lf there's another life,
all l ask is one thing only...

1885
02:25:40,565 --> 02:25:47,528
A place where love never
leaves me...

1886
02:26:18,269 --> 02:26:20,066
Have you explained all
your staff, doctor?

1887
02:26:20,338 --> 02:26:22,397
Sandhya mustn't know anything.

1888
02:26:23,107 --> 02:26:26,907
l'm dealing the case, so no other doctor
would discuss it with Sandhya.

1890
02:27:01,813 --> 02:27:03,781
Did you safely got the
children into the train?

1891
02:27:07,318 --> 02:27:07,943
l did.

1892
02:27:09,320 --> 02:27:12,448
Sree was crying, they'll be here
for summer vacation.

1893
02:27:14,826 --> 02:27:16,953
But, would l live till then?

1894
02:27:21,666 --> 02:27:23,293
Doctor told me everything, Uday.

1895
02:27:25,336 --> 02:27:28,635
He said l wouldn't survive even
if treatment had started earlier.

1896
02:27:46,224 --> 02:27:47,213
Don't cry, Uday.

1897
02:27:48,860 --> 02:27:52,887
You showed me in 7 days a life
l wouldn't have seen in 70 years.

1898
02:27:53,264 --> 02:27:54,993
l'm very happy.

1899
02:27:58,369 --> 02:27:59,563
Please don't cry.

1900
02:28:21,959 --> 02:28:24,189
My father never took care
of my mother.

1901
02:28:26,864 --> 02:28:32,200
Even during her last days in hospital,
he was busy in making money.

1902
02:28:36,607 --> 02:28:38,871
l didn't shed a tear on my dad's death.

1903
02:28:44,248 --> 02:28:47,513
But l wanted to take good
care of you, Sandhya.

1904
02:28:50,254 --> 02:28:55,191
l thought we'll spend all our lives
together happily.

1905
02:28:59,964 --> 02:29:02,125
ls there any guaranty we'll be
like that always?

1906
02:29:06,504 --> 02:29:09,735
A few years later, you may change,
l may change,

1907
02:29:10,508 --> 02:29:12,476
differences may crop up between us,

1908
02:29:13,210 --> 02:29:14,507
anything can happen,

1909
02:29:15,980 --> 02:29:18,380
there's no guaranty that
we'll still be in love.

1910
02:29:19,550 --> 02:29:22,576
lnstead of going away
when you start hating me,

1911
02:29:23,220 --> 02:29:27,054
memories would be sweet if l go away
when you still love me.

1912
02:29:30,528 --> 02:29:32,689
Aren't these short and
sweet moments enough?

1913
02:29:42,473 --> 02:29:45,442
l don't want to be here.
Please take me away.

1914
02:29:49,013 --> 02:29:52,039
lf you cry like this, l'll go away.

1915
02:29:56,921 --> 02:29:58,946
Come and sleep.
Come.

1916
02:30:00,224 --> 02:30:10,190
SOY Group Pvt.Ltd.

1917
02:30:23,080 --> 02:30:24,012
lt's 12!

1918
02:30:28,786 --> 02:30:30,947
First time you're celebrating
your birthday with me.

1919
02:30:31,589 --> 02:30:33,216
May be this is the last time.

1920
02:30:34,558 --> 02:30:38,927
That's why l brought 12 gifts
for each month.

1921
02:30:46,237 --> 02:30:51,869
Without melting away like ice,
it'll stay with all life and wish you.

1922
02:30:52,143 --> 02:30:53,110
On my behalf.

1923
02:31:01,152 --> 02:31:04,485
Sadness of withering flower will
ease on seeing the plant.

1924
02:31:04,789 --> 02:31:06,882
lt'll give you hope that
another flower will bloom.

1925
02:31:14,732 --> 02:31:15,790
Holy beed!

1926
02:31:16,100 --> 02:31:17,431
l mean eye of Lord Shiva.

1927
02:31:17,635 --> 02:31:18,624
Show me your hand.

1928
02:31:20,604 --> 02:31:22,469
Nobody must cast an evil eye on you.

1929
02:31:23,240 --> 02:31:24,969
All evils must be warded off.

1930
02:31:28,579 --> 02:31:29,637
Technology may change.

1931
02:31:29,847 --> 02:31:32,714
Once it was walkman, CD, lpod,
something else in future,

1932
02:31:32,917 --> 02:31:34,111
but this conch is permanent,

1933
02:31:34,318 --> 02:31:36,752
you can hear music always
when placed near ear.

1934
02:31:36,954 --> 02:31:37,545
Hear it.

1935
02:31:40,624 --> 02:31:43,957
You must get natural peace
instead of artificial.

1936
02:31:53,637 --> 02:31:55,468
lf you leave shirt sleeves open,
you're lazy,

1937
02:31:55,840 --> 02:31:57,205
if you fold it, you're rough,

1938
02:31:57,541 --> 02:32:00,203
if you use cuff,
you're in control of yourself.

1939
02:32:01,178 --> 02:32:03,339
Use these cuff links on white shirt.

1940
02:32:03,881 --> 02:32:07,942
Look at yourself in mirror,
you'll be confused, who is this gentleman?

1941
02:32:15,493 --> 02:32:18,485
Notjust the words you say,
what you write must also be golden.

1942
02:32:22,366 --> 02:32:24,664
As you said Chinese Ganesh.

1943
02:32:24,969 --> 02:32:29,804
Look at it for 2 minutes,
no, 2 hours till you get smile.

1944
02:32:30,975 --> 02:32:33,773
Your smile is the most
attractive feature in you.

1945
02:32:34,812 --> 02:32:38,213
You gave it to me and
masked it with my sad face.

1946
02:32:56,567 --> 02:32:58,831
This is unbreakable tea cup set.

1947
02:33:00,437 --> 02:33:03,429
Husband...children...

1948
02:33:06,477 --> 02:33:11,710
l'm little sad because l won't be there
with you as your tea.

1949
02:33:29,166 --> 02:33:32,693
lt will work till sun is there,
whether we are here or not.

1950
02:33:33,504 --> 02:33:36,940
You're very weak in your maths,
you made all wrong calculations.

1951
02:33:37,441 --> 02:33:40,604
Divide instead of multiplication,
addition instead of subtraction.

1952
02:33:41,445 --> 02:33:43,640
l'm the answer.
Zero!

1953
02:33:51,922 --> 02:33:53,890
These are my diaries,

1954
02:33:55,893 --> 02:34:00,159
before you entered my life,
all the days were same to me,

1955
02:34:00,998 --> 02:34:04,434
after you came,
every day was a wonder,

1956
02:34:05,269 --> 02:34:07,134
every day left with new and
fresh memories,

1957
02:34:09,206 --> 02:34:12,733
few things l wrote with anger
and some happily,

1958
02:34:13,844 --> 02:34:15,903
but every word is about you only,

1959
02:34:16,547 --> 02:34:23,976
because you're my last thought of the day
and first of the next morning.

1960
02:34:25,623 --> 02:34:27,215
Read it in my absence.

1961
02:34:36,333 --> 02:34:38,528
This home was my world.

1962
02:34:39,637 --> 02:34:42,470
Talking to plants was my best time.

1963
02:34:43,507 --> 02:34:47,375
But after you came l had no time for it.

1964
02:34:49,446 --> 02:34:51,778
l love this home.

1965
02:34:53,017 --> 02:34:55,212
Look after it carefully.

1966
02:34:57,388 --> 02:34:58,412
Plants too!

1967
02:35:01,992 --> 02:35:08,921
Like these 1 1 gifts, l want the 12th gift
too remains with you forever.

1968
02:35:14,171 --> 02:35:19,734
Because l don't want to die now.

1969
02:35:53,944 --> 02:35:56,242
You changed name according
to numerology.

1970
02:35:56,914 --> 02:35:59,883
But my number is 5,
it means loner.

1971
02:36:01,885 --> 02:36:03,546
lt'll not match with any number.

1972
02:36:07,257 --> 02:36:12,217
12th gift is to your taste,
short and sweet.

1973
02:36:14,765 --> 02:36:17,393
l'll be happy with you till l breath last.

1974
02:36:26,877 --> 02:36:30,369
You've your birthday party
in pub always, come, let's go.

1975
02:36:31,949 --> 02:36:32,847
Come.

1976
02:36:36,754 --> 02:36:40,417
Stop...stop...

1977
02:36:41,792 --> 02:36:44,260
Why did you bring me here
instead of a pub?

1978
02:36:44,461 --> 02:36:47,430
You like spending new year here, right?
Come.

1979
02:36:48,265 --> 02:36:48,924
Sit here.

1980
02:36:51,502 --> 02:36:53,561
lt'll rain now, watch out.

1981
02:37:08,919 --> 02:37:11,251
l never waited for anything in my life.

1982
02:37:12,322 --> 02:37:15,382
But l'll wait every year for this rain.
