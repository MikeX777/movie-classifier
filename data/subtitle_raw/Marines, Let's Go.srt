1
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:22,656
* Hup, hup

2
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,024
* Hup, two, three

3
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:25,859
* Hear him call, "Let's go"

4
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:27,928
* Come on, Marines, let's go

5
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,897
* Hit the deck, leatherneck

6
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,899
* Fall in line, double time

7
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,867
* Hear him call, "Let's go"

8
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:36,003
* Come on, Marines, let's go

9
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:40,174
* We're going to make some
history along the battle line *

10
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,276
* Hup, two, three, four

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,178
* Hup, two, three, go!

12
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:48,282
* From sunny California
to the beach at Anzio *

13
00:00:48,316 --> 00:00:52,019
* From beautiful Manila
to the gates of Tokyo *

14
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:56,290
* He fought in every battle
from the start to the end *

15
00:00:56,324 --> 00:01:00,128
* And he was always out
in front, calling to his men *

16
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:02,029
* Hear him call, "Let's go"

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,132
* Come on, Marines, let's go

18
00:01:04,165 --> 00:01:06,134
* Hit the deck, leatherneck

19
00:01:06,134 --> 00:01:08,136
* Fall in line, double time

20
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:10,138
* Hear him call, "Let's go"

21
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:12,206
* Come on, Marines, let's go

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,210
* We're going to make some
history along the battle line *

23
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:18,212
* Hear him call, "Let's go"

24
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:20,281
* Come on, Marines, let's go

25
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,216
* Hit the deck, leatherneck

26
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,252
* Fall in line, double time

27
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:26,154
* Hear him call, "Let's go"

28
00:01:26,154 --> 00:01:28,556
* Come on, Marines, let's go

29
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:32,593
* We're going to make some
history along the battle line *

30
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,795
* We're going to make
some history *

31
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,597
* Along the battle line

32
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,601
* We're going to make some
history along the battle line *

33
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,836
* We're going to make
some history *

34
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,172
* Along the battle line.

35
00:01:49,477 --> 00:01:52,480
HANK: Here is Korea, 
 where the 1st Marine Division

36
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:54,748
is holding the line 
 against the North Koreans

37
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,917
and the Chinese hordes.

38
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,819
My name is Hank Dyer.

39
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,654
And like most 
 war correspondents,

40
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:03,591
I'm writing a book 
 between dispatches,

41
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,494
not on the grand scale 
 of Caesar's Commentaries,

42
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:10,864
nor about master strategies in 
 the triumph of giant machines,

43
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:15,503
but about the smallest 
 commodity of modern war: men.

44
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,671
Particularly about the men

45
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:20,641
of Gunnery Sergeant Hawkins' 
 platoon.

46
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:23,944
Gunny's got both fools 
 and wise men here,

47
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,815
but none who lacks 
 guts and strength.

48
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,951
Pete Kono, 
 the veteran campaigner;

49
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,020
Russ Waller, the quiet one;

50
00:02:33,053 --> 00:02:37,358
Newt Levells, the naive, 
 likeable galoot from Texas.

51
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:51,472
Quite a contrast to Skip Roth, 
 with his glossy shrewdness,

52
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,342
known to his confidents as 
 The Brain.

53
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:58,546
Or David Chatfield, 
 the Back Bay aristocrat.

54
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,582
It took some doing to trim him 
 to the Marine pattern,

55
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,351
and there's still some doubt

56
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,719
that the operation 
 was a success.

57
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:10,658
And then there's that born 
 leader, Let's Go McCaffrey,

58
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,993
busted from 
 sergeant to private,

59
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,363
but don't let that fool you.

60
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:18,666
It happened on furlough, 
 not out here.

61
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,668
The fields of war 
 are the only circuit

62
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,003
that can take 
 that big fuse-blower.

63
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:29,277
And for better or for worse, 
 he's the guy these men follow.

64
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,905
(jet engines roaring)

65
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:30,971
(jet engines roaring)

66
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,966
Let's go!

67
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,639
We'll hole up here. Dig in.

68
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:07,274
-McCaffrey.
-Yo.

69
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,977
Work your fire team down
to that bunker; check it out.

70
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,979
Hey, let's go!

71
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:35,403
Let's go!

72
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,724
You guys cover me and Skip.

73
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,892
We'll get them out of there.

74
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,291
Don't knock them off.

75
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,960
We'll bring them in.

76
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,534
Hey, Sarge, you want to take
these guys along with yours?

77
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:41,735
Sure, Mac.

78
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:42,536
Gunny.

79
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,137
Yeah? Who is he?

80
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,106
Harper.

81
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,556
-How many didn't make it,
Hawkins? -Six missing.

82
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,158
-Charley Harper?
-Harper will be back.

83
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:06,560
I hear Harper got it.

84
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,395
-Tough break, Mac.
-How would you know?

85
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:10,964
He wasn't a buddy of yours;
he was a buddy of mine.

86
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,634
Why don't you speak plain,
McCaffrey?

87
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,737
Spare me that customary delicacy
of yours for a change.

88
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,239
Don't give me that college
crapola, you pedigree pup!

89
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,108
Come on, Dave,
don't think anything of it.

90
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:22,109
It's that kind of a day.

91
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,511
No, it's routine.

92
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:24,812
I get born in a bed
with silk sheets,

93
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,413
and he's dedicated
to the principle

94
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:27,581
of never letting me forget it!

95
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,182
I don't care how you was born,

96
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:31,619
just get that snoot of yours
down out of the air, Chatfield!

97
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,621
"Were born," Mac,
not "was born."

98
00:07:33,654 --> 00:07:35,422
-Who you talking to?
-"Whom," not "who,"

99
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:37,758
and a verb after it would
further improve the syntax.

100
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,092
Don't bug me, Skip.

101
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:40,528
I don't feel like
slugging you today.

102
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:41,962
Come on.

103
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,273
McCaffrey, such an act
of physical violence

104
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,976
-will soon be
beneath your dignity. -What?

105
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,779
I hear you're gonna be promoted
for meritorious service,

106
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,681
skipping the rank of corporal
right up to sergeant.

107
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,616
-Huh?
-Oh, no.

108
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,118
What, you're not happy about it?

109
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,387
Promotions can lose a guy
a lot of old buddies.

110
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,822
Now, don't you worry, McCaffrey,

111
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:11,224
you'll get busted again,
just as you always do.

112
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:12,960
(laughter)

113
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,196
Yeah, it's kind of confusing
to remember what my rank is.

114
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,798
Well, anyhow,
here's the rest of the news.

115
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,133
This outfit's going
into regimental reserve.

116
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,803
Should mean a leave for
the Let's Go McCaffrey Club.

117
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,237
And that'll mean Japan!

118
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,205
Yahoo!

119
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,051
I'll bet you'll be glad
to get the furlough.

120
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,020
My wife's coming down
to Yokosuka from Tokyo.

121
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,188
She works there in

122
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:43,256
the Department
of Army Civilian Employees.

123
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,658
And you know something?

124
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,827
This will be our first chance
for a honeymoon.

125
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,161
We were called back into action

126
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,830
five minutes after
I said, "I do."

127
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,399
Sounds like quite a change
from this out here.

128
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,667
Yeah, but there's a catch to it.

129
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,268
Some of the men
are going to Yokosuka

130
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,837
for rest and rehabilitation.

131
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,839
Lieutenant asked me unofficially
to keep an eye on them.

132
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,174
-McCaffrey? -McCaffrey and
some of the other guys.

133
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,242
He's up for decoration.

134
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,712
We want him in top shape
for the big brass.

135
00:09:04,745 --> 00:09:06,614
That's a large order
for McCaffrey.

136
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,081
Right.

137
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:11,251
A headache to the enemy,
but a real migraine to the MPs.

138
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,288
(people speaking Japanese)

139
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,790
Hi.

140
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,711
(sighs)

141
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,479
My prayers are answered.

142
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,649
My brave one comes back.

143
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,550
Not so brave, Song Do.

144
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:46,553
McCaffrey's been having
severe doubts about me lately.

145
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:49,489
-The one you call
Let's Hurry Up Go? -Uh-huh.

146
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:53,093
Maybe it's his way to hide
that he's not brave himself.

147
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,262
Oh, no, you can't
take that away from him.

148
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:58,966
He's a wild bull, and that
also goes for his mentality.

149
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:07,741
For three days and three nights,
I listen to the guns.

150
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:10,978
I watch the sky red with fire.

151
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,980
I felt the ground tremble,

152
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:16,784
and I trembled too with terror
for your safety.

153
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,687
And when sleep tried
to close my eyes,

154
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,422
your face was always before me.

155
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,793
And I would awake my grandfather
with cries in the night.

156
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,594
Is your grandfather well?

157
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,931
Yes, but so old.

158
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,033
This war has grieved him.

159
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:35,502
He will not wake up someday.

160
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,838
And then you'd be alone.

161
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,440
You won't be alone, Song Do.

162
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,943
I'll pull through alive.

163
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,178
And no matter
where else they send me,

164
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:47,314
I'll get back to you somehow.

165
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:53,120
(laughs)

166
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:54,988
Lee-san.

167
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:58,291
Sit down, my good friend.

168
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:03,997
And, uh, don't think you must
bear gifts each time we see you.

169
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:08,301
It is you yourself whom we love.

170
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,504
I heard a rumor that I might
get a leave before long.

171
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,742
And I thought you might need
a few things while I'm away--

172
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:18,045
some canned fruit, chocolate,
rice and tea.

173
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,381
You will not pass this way again
before you go?

174
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,650
No, I'm afraid not.

175
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:27,654
Then my letter will find you,
care of postmaster.

176
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:33,393
Your family would never
accept Song Do.

177
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,763
No, but I accept her.

178
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,399
I love her, and that's that.

179
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:44,204
I've broken with the past.

180
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:47,174
It all happened
when I wanted to be a Marine

181
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:50,543
with my father holding out for
desk commission in Washington.

182
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,179
I wanted to be a Marine.

183
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:58,018
Why do you not go to McCaffrey
and tell him these things?

184
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,788
Try and talk to McCaffrey?

185
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:01,922
Never.

186
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:05,125
And yet, a little while ago,

187
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:10,063
you talked of him
as though you admired him.

188
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:16,403
You know, it's strange, Lee-san,
but I do admire him.

189
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,308
I think it would be one of
the happiest days of my life

190
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:27,047
if he ever walked up to me,
shook my hand and said,

191
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,217
"Chatfield,
you'll be all right."

192
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,152
(playing melody)

193
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,184
*

194
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:26,306
* Hup, hup, hup, two, three

195
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,141
* Hear him call, "Let's go"

196
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,210
* Come on, Marines, let's go

197
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,879
* Hit the deck, leatherneck

198
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:34,181
* Fall in line, double time

199
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,149
* Hear him call, "Let's go"

200
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:38,451
* Come on, Marines, let's go

201
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:42,422
* We're going to make some
history along the battle line. *

202
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,995
So every officer and man
in our services

203
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,730
should appoint himself
an ambassador of good will.

204
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:55,402
Both in manners and speech,
he should impress our allies

205
00:13:55,435 --> 00:14:00,040
and even our enemies with
our sincerity and cordiality.

206
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,308
Man, this whole thing's

207
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,642
beginning to undermine
your character.

208
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,012
You just worry about
your own character.

209
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,914
I don't want my buddies
horsing around on leave

210
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,715
like a bunch of Navajo Indians.

211
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:11,584
And you talk about Chatfield.

212
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,486
Look at him moping.

213
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,056
Probably over some
flat-chested society dame

214
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,657
who's cheating on him.

215
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,561
I can read the mind of that punk
like a skull with window glass.

216
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,696
I can hear you.

217
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,398
Yeah, you're brilliant, you are.

218
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,400
Well, maybe you can tell me
what we're gonna do for money.

219
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:31,404
I um, guess you guys heard that
I ran into a little bad luck

220
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:33,673
against a pair of loaded dice
down at the airstrip,

221
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,010
and we are, as they say,
flat on our honkers.

222
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:39,112
But I'm thinking all the time.
(chuckles)

223
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:41,114
Yeah, that's it--
when old Skip starts thinking,

224
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:42,849
we got nothing to worry about.

225
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,185
So let's get down
to the real tactical stuff.

226
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,956
Levells, as usual,
you'll do scout patrol.

227
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:51,191
Only you got a tougher problem
this time:

228
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,460
finding a couple
of kimono cuties

229
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:55,963
who likes a guy for himself
and not his dough.

230
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:57,397
Deal me out.

231
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,532
I got a gal, and she lives
right there in Yokosuka

232
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,600
where we're going.

233
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,535
Your duty to your buddies
comes first.

234
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,704
Nah, come on, Newt,
you can't let us down.

235
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,974
Why, you got a knack for
meeting more girls accidentally

236
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,208
than most guys do on purpose.

237
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,377
Maybe so,
but them days are over.

238
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,711
That's what you think.

239
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,780
I'm not asking you;
I'm telling you.

240
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:16,716
Well, listen, you don't
have to find a broad for me.

241
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,385
I got my own.

242
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,820
Well, I'll be happy to act
as an interpreter for you guys.

243
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,556
The language of love
is universal,

244
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,659
especially when the cherry
blossoms are in bloom.

245
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,228
And according to my calendar,

246
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,231
the, uh, cherries should be ripe
while we're in Japan.

247
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,001
I cut this out of
the, uh, Yokosuka American.

248
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,403
Says, "Hotel Okamoto,

249
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,238
"catering to the best,
family trade,

250
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:42,109
"has own bathhouse on premises,
refined scrub girls,

251
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:45,912
expert manipulators
and certified masseuses."

252
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,081
(laughs) I'd buy that!

253
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,249
What with?

254
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,019
You just keep thinking.

255
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:55,455
You'll figure an angle, Skip.

256
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:57,290
See that cigar?

257
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:59,592
That's the same kind
that Winston smokes.

258
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,129
I remember I was coming back
in a convoy with him,

259
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:05,265
and I said, uh, "Winnie,
how'd you like the trip?"

260
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,767
And he said... (clears throat)

261
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,939
"Well, jolly good, jolly good,
except for one thing.

262
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,146
(clears throat) "There were
11 of your American Marines

263
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:23,050
"chasing three
of our British nurses

264
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,286
"up and down the deck
of the ship.

265
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:32,059
"And never (coughs)
have so many chased so few,

266
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:35,462
so far, and received so little."

267
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,397
(laughter)

268
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,183
Glad to see you chose
a fine, respectable place.

269
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,085
Are you sure
your finances can handle it?

270
00:16:58,085 --> 00:16:59,686
Thrift will be necessary.

271
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,888
Take it easy; tomorrow's
a big day for Mac's decoration.

272
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:04,091
Yeah, thanks for helping us
with the transportation, Gunny.

273
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:07,294
That's all right. I'll be using
your driver once in a while.

274
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,332
This looks like
a pretty classy joint.

275
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,666
What are we gonna use for money?

276
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,834
Relax, Mac.

277
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,403
I got a little gadget in here

278
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,671
that'll take care of
the room rent in nothing flat.

279
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,173
What is it, a bomb?

280
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:23,176
Nope. It's a much more modern
work of science.

281
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,579
Pete, you stay here
and do like I told you.

282
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,548
Ten-hut!

283
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,854
(speaks Japanese)

284
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,424
Greetings and salutations
from my distinguished commander.

285
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,392
He will require
a private room and bath,

286
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,128
plus two others for his staff.

287
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:42,129
Who is he?

288
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:44,030
(shushes)

289
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:45,398
Military secret.

290
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:47,534
His code name is Red Fox.

291
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:53,806
Family hotel, catering only to
respectable, married families.

292
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,744
My good man, we are here on
a mission of the utmost delicacy

293
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,147
which can only be accomplished
in a hotel

294
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:01,981
of the most peerless
respectability,

295
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,151
and yet you refuse to aid us.

296
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:06,052
Very sorry, very sorry.

297
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:08,588
"Very sorry, very sorry."

298
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:12,159
Well, Captain Sampson
and the chief of staff

299
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,162
will be keenly disappointed
to hear this.

300
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:16,929
Red Fox calling Blue Boy.

301
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,265
Blue Boy. Blue Boy.

302
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:20,733
Red Fox calling Blue Boy.

303
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,236
Blue Boy, Blue Boy.
Come in, Red Fox. Over.

304
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,473
Red Fox, sir, there are
no accommodations available

305
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:29,976
in the hotel that
General McArthur selected. Over.

306
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,644
Who say so, the manager?

307
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,481
Put him on.

308
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,916
If the honorable
Japanese manager won't cooperate

309
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,751
with the honorable
American intelligence units

310
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,321
on a secret mission,
then he's put his country

311
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,089
in a very dishonorable mess.
Over.

312
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,591
No, no, no, no.

313
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:49,296
Japanese people always cooperate
with great hospitality.

314
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:52,031
Japan very much love
occupying American.

315
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,766
-How nice.
-Yes, yes.

316
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,602
Commander?

317
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:56,869
(clears throat)

318
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,775
Red Fox. No more?

319
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,712
(shushes)

320
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,046
Ah.

321
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,216
(bell dings)

322
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,287
-Where are the phones?
-You got phones?

323
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,489
-There, sir.
-Crazy.

324
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,795
(over radio):
Red Fox, Red Fox,

325
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,997
don't forget a double bed
for Blue Boy.

326
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:26,366
Oh, Blue Boy's quite a joker.

327
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:29,669
You'd be crazy about him.
(chuckles)

328
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:33,640
-(typing)
-"Don't forget a double bed

329
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,743
for Blue Boy"?

330
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,151
Well, what is it? What is it?

331
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:47,820
Captain Sampson, sir, I just
picked this out of the air,

332
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,890
and I'm a little confused
by the code names.

333
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:55,728
"Honorable hotel, Red Fox,
Blue Boy, General MacArthur."

334
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,664
I swear, Captain,
I took it down verbatim.

335
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:01,601
"Intelligence unit
on secret mission,

336
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,203
a double bed for Blue Boy."

337
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:07,173
Intelligence's coding system
must be all fouled up.

338
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,076
Tell them to run this down and
call it Operation Gainesboro.

339
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,578
Aye-aye, sir.

340
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,020
We have very finest bath
in Japan on roof.

341
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,891
Very strong and pretty girls
for scrubbing, you know.

342
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:37,404
Big room with fine exposure.

343
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:41,207
Great American-family-sized beds
for supreme comfort.

344
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,709
Get very happy sleep.

345
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,877
Well, boys, I can be
chummy up to a point,

346
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,212
but this is ridiculous.

347
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,549
But for Mr. Red Fox,
a private room,

348
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:53,219
fitting for commander
of expedition.

349
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,421
Nice joint you got here,
Yoshida.

350
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:55,722
When I get back to Washington,

351
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,824
I'll tell the president
all about it.

352
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:59,559
No, no, no, no, please.

353
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,662
This room is booked for
soon coming honeymoon couple.

354
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,397
Yes, I see
by the vase of flowers.

355
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,065
Cherry blossoms, aren't they?

356
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,000
Artificial, but nice sentiment.

357
00:21:08,034 --> 00:21:09,436
Yes, it is.

358
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:13,906
Uh, Hotel Okamoto
wishes your mission success.

359
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,410
If you need help with secret
spy work, call on Yoshida.

360
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,779
Just consider yourself
one of us, Yoshida-san.

361
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,180
Bountiful thanks.

362
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,649
And you will not be
disappointed.

363
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:25,918
I was once house detective.

364
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,621
(speaks Japanese)

365
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:32,091
Grab a mattress and sleep
on the floor, Chatfield.

366
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,259
You won't catch cold.

367
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,461
How could I?

368
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:37,364
I brought my silk sheets
with me.

369
00:21:38,365 --> 00:21:40,400
(whistling tune)

370
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,175
Well, I got a phone call through
and struck gold.

371
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,010
You did? Where?

372
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,945
No place you could cut it.

373
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,147
This is a hideout deal.

374
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,783
And you leave big footprints.

375
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,618
You know, there's something
crummy about you, Waller.

376
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,152
Look who's talking.

377
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:01,954
You ain't no angel, McCaffrey.

378
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,657
No, I'm not,
but I don't hide nothing.

379
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:07,460
My hands are always on the table
in plain sight.

380
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:08,895
But not yours.

381
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:10,863
I get the feeling
they're kind of dirty.

382
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:14,534
You know, if you wasn't apt to
be my sergeant, I'd flatten you.

383
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:15,902
Well, come on, chicken,
I'm still a private.

384
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:19,906
Now, come on, fellas,
cut it out!

385
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,409
The matter with you?

386
00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:24,877
We're gonna have some fun, huh?
What's the matter?

387
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:27,647
Thanks, Skip. I-I got to be
careful and get that promotion.

388
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,148
Yeah, that promotion.

389
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,050
But you're not very happy
about it, are you?

390
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,153
(chuckles) No, it just won't be
the same old happy life.

391
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,655
Well, I wish I could help you,

392
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:38,425
but who am I
to challenge destiny?

393
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:40,427
Hey, Newt, what's the score
with you? When's the wedding?

394
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:43,563
I gave the clerk her address and
we looked up the phone number,

395
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:44,564
but she's moved.

396
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:45,932
My nerves are jumpy, Skip.

397
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,900
I think I'll get me
one of them baths,

398
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:50,603
let one of them cuties
give me a massage.

399
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,240
Why don't you fellas go up,
keep an eye on him.

400
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:56,843
He's liable to start
massaging those cuties himself.

401
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,978
I think you got
something there, Skip.

402
00:23:02,949 --> 00:23:05,452
Well, this mattress is no good
without a pillow.

403
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:07,186
Poor old McCaffrey.

404
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,688
What do you mean?

405
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,590
Uh, I should've let him
put Waller in the hospital

406
00:23:10,623 --> 00:23:11,891
and lose his promotion.

407
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,693
He'd be happier,
I'd be happier.

408
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:14,961
We'd all be happier.

409
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:16,529
Maybe he'd even
take it easier on you.

410
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:18,197
Yeah, I know what you mean.

411
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,733
I guess the man wasn't born for
responsibilities and restraints.

412
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,301
Only when the guns are firing.

413
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:26,205
When McCaffrey's on furlough,
he just doesn't fit in.

414
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,875
You know, I'd almost be willing
to see him wreck this joint

415
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,611
just to save him the misery
of that promotion.

416
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:33,613
Well, I'll see you
at the baths, huh?

417
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:34,881
Yeah, I'll be right up.

418
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,716
I, uh, just want to catch up

419
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,851
on my correspondence
with Mother.

420
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:44,290
Private McCaffrey,
Hotel Okamoto.

421
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:46,626
-(child giggles)
-Hello there.

422
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:51,297
Hey, what am I offered here?!

423
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,400
(speaking Japanese)

424
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:56,335
Yeah, I'll take
anything you got.

425
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,505
(laughs)

426
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:04,911
Letter for Private McCaffrey,
requesting quick delivery.

427
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,614
Red Fox McCaffrey, that's me.

428
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:08,981
Who'd know I'm here, Skip?

429
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:10,583
Well, we had to leave
a temporary address

430
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:12,084
at the air station.

431
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,353
Yeah, maybe it's something
about my promotion.

432
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,755
Uh, my hands are wet, honey.

433
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:19,158
Read it to me,
if you savvy the lingo.

434
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,693
Um, "Dear Desmond."

435
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:23,930
-Desmond!
-(excited chatter, laughter)

436
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,265
Well, I think that'll sound
rather dashing,

437
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,267
Sergeant Desmond McCaffrey.

438
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,603
-(laughter)
-Nobody ever calls me that name.

439
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:32,304
Somebody must have been
looking in the files.

440
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:34,106
Desmond! (whooping)

441
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,944
"Dear Desmond, for a long time,
I have wished to express

442
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,146
"my secret admiration for you.

443
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:42,114
"I withheld the impulse,

444
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:45,451
"fearing that the deep emotion
you inspire in me might be

445
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:48,788
"misunderstood by a person
less sensitive than you and I.

446
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,557
-(men whooping, laughing)
-"At last, however,

447
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:52,124
"when I saw you here,

448
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:55,728
revealed in all your masculine
Greek god magnificence..."

449
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:56,829
(laughter, whistling)

450
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:58,030
Where'd that letter come from?

451
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:00,032
I found it
on the reception desk.

452
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:02,201
Perhaps a lady in the women's
bath took an admiring peek.

453
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,137
No, some crumb-bum in here
wrote it.

454
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,839
I got a notion
to wreck this joint!

455
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,307
You got the right idea, Mac.

456
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,810
I'd make a United Nations case
out of this.

457
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,745
Wait, read some more, honey.

458
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:14,681
I'll get a clue
to who I'm gonna murder.

459
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:18,184
"I fled to the retiring room
and penned this missive,

460
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,086
"which I hope you will
never discuss

461
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,988
with your coarse
and vulgar associates."

462
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:24,490
-Whoops. -All right, Skip,
who's been out of here?

463
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:26,759
Who's been out of here
long enough to write that junk?

464
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:28,260
Gee, I don't know, Desmond.

465
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:29,862
I guess I was too relaxed.

466
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:32,699
You keep reading, honey;
we'll look for a clue.

467
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:35,835
"But for the present,
I must remain anonymous,

468
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,070
"dreading that
you may think ill of me,

469
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:41,173
"languishing for some
future moment when I can look

470
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:44,611
"into your great, blue eyes and
know the true poetic tenderness

471
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:47,413
that you conceal beneath your
gruff exterior." -(laughter)

472
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,181
Poetic, huh?

473
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,183
Tender, huh?

474
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,351
How's it signed?

475
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,419
"Lonesome."

476
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:54,954
(laughter, whooping, whistling)

477
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:56,856
All right, I'll find that joker!

478
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,858
-I'll knock that lollypop
off his stick! -Attaboy.

479
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,627
What kind of a joint
are you running here?

480
00:26:00,627 --> 00:26:02,361
I'll rip this place wide open.

481
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,764
It'll take all the plumbers in
Japan to put it together again!

482
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:08,234
Now you're talking, buddy!

483
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,171
(laughs)

484
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:14,974
Wait a minute.

485
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:16,643
Why didn't I
think of this before?

486
00:26:16,643 --> 00:26:18,377
Think of what before?

487
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,813
I got it now.

488
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:23,382
It was one of these cuties
in here wrote it.

489
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,784
Did you girlies go to school

490
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:27,319
and learn your English
real good, huh?

491
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:29,455
Or maybe you were right, honey.

492
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,123
Maybe some dame
did take a peek in here

493
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:33,325
and remembers me
from my last trip to this burg.

494
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:35,494
(laughs)

495
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:39,131
Sure, I'm always blowing my
stack without analyzing things.

496
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:40,332
(chuckles)

497
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:42,001
Hey, honey, you've been
scrubbing me real nice.

498
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,335
-Let me scrub you.
-(woman shrieks)

499
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:45,304
(laughter)

500
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:50,777
(playful shouting)

501
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:55,481
Uh, miss, bring me
a bottle of cognac.

502
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:56,916
I'm expecting a lady friend.

503
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,084
-Cognac. Cognac.
-Fine. Cognac.

504
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,185
Okay? Yeah.

505
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:01,353
-Thank you very much.
-That's all.

506
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,963
Hi, lover boy.

507
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:13,365
Hi-ya, kid. You've been
on my mind ever since Honolulu.

508
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,167
(chuckles)
Oh.

509
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:16,836
Mm.

510
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,938
I managed to get away
for a little while,

511
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,439
but I got to be back
pretty soon.

512
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,842
What is this, always having
to get back to somebody?

513
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,977
The same way in Honolulu.

514
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:26,713
I've been wondering about you.

515
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:28,314
You just keep on wondering,
big boy.

516
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:29,782
Maybe that'll
keep you interested.

517
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,383
Stop bugging me.

518
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,185
What's with you, anyhow?

519
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:35,021
Why don't you have me
up to your place?

520
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:38,124
My place is
anywhere we get together.

521
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,727
You know what I mean--
your home.

522
00:27:40,727 --> 00:27:42,795
(laughs)

523
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,463
Social climber, huh?

524
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,132
Mm-hmm.

525
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,235
Okay, you got an invitation
for tonight.

526
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:52,404
I'll leave
the back door unlocked.

527
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,810
You big ape.

528
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:00,312
Why do I take
these chances for you?

529
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:03,182
You know why.

530
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:05,417
Yep, I guess I do.

531
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:06,819
Oh, uh, no, miss.

532
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:09,021
(speaking Japanese)

533
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:13,826
(speaking Japanese)

534
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,227
Come on, baby.

535
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:17,163
Uh-huh.

536
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,131
Let's go.

537
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,310
*

538
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,082
What is the soldier's pleasure?

539
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:37,784
Well, I ain't feeling
much pleasure, miss,

540
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:40,686
but I'd be obliged to learn
where Grace Blake has moved to.

541
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:42,521
I used to write her
at this number.

542
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,690
Grace, did you say?

543
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:46,793
Are you by any chance
her brother?

544
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:48,861
Uh, no, ma'am, I'm her feller.

545
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:50,396
We're gonna get married.

546
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,799
I believe Grace did
mention something,

547
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,600
that she had some sort
of a misalliance

548
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,102
with an American Marine.

549
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:58,304
Well, no, ma'am,
we didn't mess around none.

550
00:28:58,337 --> 00:29:00,406
Oh, she was one girl
I sure respected.

551
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:01,874
Come into the parlor.

552
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:03,810
I'll see what information
I have about her.

553
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:12,318
Here we are.

554
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:13,552
Blake, Grace.

555
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,721
Brunette, age 28.

556
00:29:15,822 --> 00:29:17,256
Height: five-foot-six.

557
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:19,959
Excellent figure,
lady-like manners.

558
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,393
Yeah, and to think
a lady like Grace

559
00:29:21,427 --> 00:29:23,062
had to live in
a Japanese prison camp.

560
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,730
We won't discuss that.

561
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:26,933
I'm sorry, she didn't leave
a forwarding address.

562
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:31,303
Well, this is
a terrible disappointment to me.

563
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:33,739
See, ever since I left Texas,
I've been dreaming about

564
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,174
somehow getting to Japan,

565
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:37,977
and-and instead I landed
straight into Busan, Korea.

566
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,347
Well, I have a wide social
acquaintance in this city.

567
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,015
There are any number
of nice girls

568
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:44,450
to whom I could introduce you.

569
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:45,451
Sit down, won't you?

570
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,086
No, ma'am.

571
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,089
Thanking you all the same,
but I ain't feeling so hot.

572
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:53,459
Ah, youth-- its broken hearts
can be quickly mended.

573
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:57,496
Sit down and tell me about
your exciting young life.

574
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,031
You're a Marine I see.

575
00:29:59,065 --> 00:30:02,101
Your pay amounts to a great deal
in Japanese yen.

576
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,270
You are a lucky boy, really.

577
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,038
Money is only
a little material thing,

578
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:08,107
and yet it compensates
for many sorrows.

579
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,477
I spent my last pay
two months before I got it.

580
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,945
How naughty of you.

581
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,280
You are a prodigal,

582
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:17,449
perhaps because your pay
is only a trifle to you.

583
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:20,152
I believe you mentioned
being from Texas,

584
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:23,722
that great, rich American state
of oil, cattle and millionaires.

585
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:27,226
Yes'm, but my folks are only
poor cotton sharecroppers.

586
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,194
Really?

587
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:29,695
That is most unfortunate.

588
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:32,198
Well, I hope I haven't
detained you too long.

589
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,366
And life ticks away so fast,
doesn't it?

590
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,568
Not a precious moment
should be wasted.

591
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:38,537
-(phone ringing)
-Good-bye.

592
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,841
Yes?

593
00:30:46,112 --> 00:30:48,380
Oh, doggone,
my bad luck's got me so loco,

594
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:50,016
I don't even know
where I'm going.

595
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:53,886
Maybe your luck change now,
solider boy.

596
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,322
Me, Su Me Sagita.

597
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,524
Me, Sio Sagita.

598
00:30:58,557 --> 00:30:59,725
Me, Toyo Sagita.

599
00:30:59,758 --> 00:31:01,593
We all three sisters.

600
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:02,995
He pretty nice.

601
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:04,430
Nice for Marine.

602
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:06,365
Big dreamy-eyed boy.

603
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:09,201
Sagita sisters share everything
with each other.

604
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:10,402
Yeah, where we going?

605
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:11,603
To Yokosuka Gaiety Club.

606
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:13,272
No, no, I wouldn't do you
no good there.

607
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:15,174
-I got bad troubles.
-Aw.

608
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,343
But there's some buddies of mine
who are raring to go.

609
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,178
They've been counting on me
for something like this.

610
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,947
If you're all gonna be
at the Gaiety tonight,

611
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,081
I'll bring them on over.

612
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:23,115
-Happy times!
-(giggling)

613
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:25,084
We keep honorable get-together.

614
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:26,518
-Sayonara.
-Sayonara.

615
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,120
Sayonara.

616
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:34,593
(chuckles)

617
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,528
That dumb little cookie
that wrote this, Gus--

618
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,630
why didn't she tell me to
my face she's nuts about me?

619
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:40,066
I ain't hard to talk to.

620
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:42,034
Yeah, I wonder
if she's got a girlfriend.

621
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:43,469
What if she has? What do we do?

622
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,537
Invite them up here
for a dinner of sea rations?

623
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,373
Wouldn't that make
a swell impression.

624
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:51,243
More dames out there in the
Ginza than snowballs in Alaska,

625
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:53,579
all just itching
to make my acquaintance,

626
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,647
if I had a little scratch
in my pocket.

627
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:59,485
And with all due respect to that
Greek god physique of yours,

628
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,988
let's not underestimate
the power of a little money.

629
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:05,391
Ah, why'd I bother
to take a bath anyway?

630
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,559
From the look on your kisser,

631
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:09,728
I guess you didn't catch up
with that broad of yours.

632
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,398
She's a lady, and don't you be
calling her a broad.

633
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,267
You never seen a lady till
you've seen that broad of mine.

634
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:17,569
I've seen the place
where she used to live.

635
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:20,572
It's a real nice boarding house
run by a real lady.

636
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:23,909
The last thing I'm looking for
is room and board.

637
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,511
What else you got to report?

638
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:29,681
Su Me, Toyo, Sio.

639
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:31,617
Cut the Japanese lingo.

640
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,120
Don't try to cover up
you blew your mission, Levells.

641
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:35,821
But I didn't;
that's their names.

642
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:38,424
Three of the cutest
little bunnies you ever seen.

643
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,358
Yeah?

644
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:40,859
Family type, not gold diggers?

645
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:44,096
Well, I'm afraid
this ain't exactly Lin Leese.

646
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,764
They seem to know
their way around.

647
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,933
They said to meet them
at the Gaiety Club tonight.

648
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:50,102
The Gaiety Club?

649
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:51,803
Why, coffee's a buck
a cup there,

650
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:54,873
and we're so broke,
we're eating kettle rations.

651
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,509
And now, gentlemen,
I am going down to the lobby,

652
00:32:57,543 --> 00:33:01,847
and I'm gonna hit old "Ahso" for
about 200 bucks worth of yen.

653
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,450
Oh, come on, you'll have this
whole hotel down on our heads.

654
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,951
That's what they said to the guy

655
00:33:06,052 --> 00:33:07,553
who built
the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

656
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:08,787
Just take it easy, Skip.

657
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,855
We got to remember tomorrow.

658
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,323
Mac, will you relax?

659
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:14,126
I have just gotten a scheme
that is so brilliant

660
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,662
that it took me five minutes
to think of it.

661
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,068
Look...

662
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:24,170
Boy, that Marine is a genius.

663
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:26,138
You give him
a Rock Island timetable

664
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:27,639
and an Ingersoll watch,
and I bet

665
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,841
he'd be president of the road
in 20 minutes.

666
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,078
(speaking Japanese)

667
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,769
That is honeymoon couple
I mentioned.

668
00:33:57,803 --> 00:33:59,205
Ah, so.

669
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:01,207
-Fine, young people.
-Oh, yes, sirree.

670
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,276
But cannot rent a room
in respectable hotel

671
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,877
to show marriage certificate.

672
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,346
Well, naturally.

673
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,515
It certainly is a comfort,
Yoshida-san, to know

674
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,584
that we're in such
incorruptible surroundings.

675
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:15,221
It, uh, sort of lightens
my other cares.

676
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:16,788
What's the matter?

677
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:19,358
Is Red Fox operation
not proceeding as planned?

678
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,959
No, no, not quite.

679
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:22,394
Has headquarters phoned us?

680
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:25,764
-No call from Blue Boy.
-No call from Blue Boy?

681
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,533
Well, there's just
too much red tape.

682
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,867
They're all tangled up in it.

683
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,602
When I get back to my desk
in Washington,

684
00:34:30,636 --> 00:34:33,239
there'll be some fur flying,
I can tell you.

685
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:35,207
Blue Boy, Blue Boy, Blue Boy.

686
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:37,443
Red Fox calling Blue Boy.
Come in.

687
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,811
This is Blue Boy.
Come in, Red Fox. Over.

688
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:42,914
Uh, Captain Sampson said,
uh-uh-uh, Blue Boy, sir,

689
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:46,051
uh, we left you in such a hurry
that, uh, we forgot to pick up

690
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:47,719
our expense money. Over.

691
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,821
A very understandable oversight,
Red Fox,

692
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:52,891
but we have no messenger
available at the moment.

693
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,793
Tell you what you do.

694
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,262
Have the management of the hotel

695
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:58,230
advance you the equivalent
of $200 in yen.

696
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:01,767
$200-- that is very much yen!

697
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,968
I heard that.

698
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:04,770
Who was it, the manager?
Put him on.

699
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:08,474
Uh, since you're one of us,
Yoshida-san,

700
00:35:08,507 --> 00:35:12,077
I feel free to divulge that,
uh, Blue Boy is none other than

701
00:35:12,178 --> 00:35:14,646
Chester Sampson,
the captain in charge

702
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,015
of our military police
here in Yokosuka.

703
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:20,252
And I can assure you that,
uh, Chet will reimburse you

704
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:24,923
for any money advance,
no matter the amount.

705
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:27,193
(speaking Japanese) Over.

706
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:29,295
(speaking Japanese over radio)

707
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:32,764
Uh, don't be alarmed.

708
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:35,201
That's merely
the, uh, staff interpreter.

709
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:37,369
(speaking Japanese)

710
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:41,773
Very well, very well.

711
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:43,475
Extremely proud to help.

712
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:46,011
Oh.

713
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:48,214
Everything all over.

714
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,988
(laughs)

715
00:35:57,022 --> 00:35:59,225
Oh, thank you, Yoshida-san.

716
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:01,827
(speaking Japanese)

717
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,631
Uh, just for, uh,
incidental expenses, huh?

718
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,065
Say, by the way, what was it

719
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,368
the, uh, captain's interpreter
said to you?

720
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:12,971
He say,
"Cooperate or Uncle Sammy will

721
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,540
cut off reconstruction funds."

722
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:18,043
My hotel would lose
thousands of dollars.

723
00:36:18,076 --> 00:36:20,712
(over radio): Now, don't you
worry Yoshida-san.

724
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:23,415
Captain Sampson's heart
is as big as Mount Fujiyama.

725
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:25,684
He'll back you win or lose.

726
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,858
Perkins!

727
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:34,059
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

728
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:35,494
Now, that's better.

729
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,929
I'm heartened by your response.

730
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:39,731
You do know your name.

731
00:36:39,765 --> 00:36:41,500
I was about convinced
that everybody around here

732
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,001
belonged in a psycho ward.

733
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,704
Yes, sir,
I'm-I'm afraid you're right.

734
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:48,073
Here's the latest
I picked up on Red Fox.

735
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:49,708
And Blue Boy?

736
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:50,776
Yes, sir.

737
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:53,679
Blue Boy is supposed to be
a captain.

738
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,514
They're still chattering
all over the place,

739
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,049
and now a couple of Japanese
are getting into the act.

740
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:01,587
Blue Boy says to Red Fox,
"Have your hotel manager

741
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,556
loan you $200,
and he'll guarantee payment."

742
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,692
Very generous fellow
this Blue Boy.

743
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:07,593
Oh, very, sir.

744
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:09,127
The 200 was only a starter.

745
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,562
Pretty soon,
it got up to thousands.

746
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:13,299
Did you gather who this
philanthropist might be?

747
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:14,566
Speak plainly, Perkins.

748
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,368
Who is Blue Boy supposed to be?

749
00:37:16,402 --> 00:37:19,505
You, sir.

750
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:24,876
Get me Intelligence.

751
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,446
The place we planned
to spend our honeymoon

752
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:29,147
when you were called away.

753
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,384
It's just as lovely
as I imagined it would be.

754
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:34,386
Not a care in the world
this time, darling.

755
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,623
Just you and me
and the little cooing doves.

756
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:38,824
Welcome.

757
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,392
Wait a minute.

758
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:42,961
This looks like
a old Army game again.

759
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,963
Don't tell me
we're not going to get in.

760
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,466
Well, young woman can get in
and you can get in,

761
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:48,734
but not together.

762
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,801
Now, see here,

763
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:52,070
we're a perfectly decent
married couple.

764
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,339
Well, wedding ring is

765
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:55,407
very applicable
for present situation,

766
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:57,609
but a marriage certificate
is more convincing.

767
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:59,578
Now, look here, Charlie,
we been married two years.

768
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:00,946
I don't carry
a marriage certificate around

769
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:01,980
in my duffle bag.

770
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,615
Well, here, this is who I am--

771
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:05,484
Marine Gunnery Sergeant
Howard Hawkins.

772
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,686
What else do you want to see,
my good behavior medal?

773
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,688
I tell you, I'm his wife.

774
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:10,922
His wife.

775
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,524
(horn honks)

776
00:38:12,558 --> 00:38:14,693
(speaking Japanese excitedly)

777
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:20,399
(speaking Japanese excitedly)

778
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,438
Honey, you understand Japanese.

779
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:27,706
What is he saying?

780
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,140
Your men have acquired
a lot of money

781
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:31,109
and are going on a bender
at the Gaiety Club.

782
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,779
What I'd like to know is:
what's that got to do with us?

783
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,046
It's just one of
those things, honey,

784
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,382
I've got to straighten out.

785
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:38,450
Two years a bride,
but never a wife.

786
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:41,587
Ah, so, now truth come out
in the wash.

787
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:45,123
Baby, I just got to
look after them.

788
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,393
Talk to the man in Japanese
and get us a nice room,

789
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:48,560
and I'll be right back.

790
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,835
*

791
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,927
*

792
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:32,704
Two bottles bourbon,
two bottles gin,

793
00:39:32,738 --> 00:39:36,107
one bottle of rum
and a case of beer for chasers.

794
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:37,342
And some scotch.

795
00:39:37,443 --> 00:39:39,044
And some scotch for my buddy.

796
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,743
They all look good to me.

797
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:21,553
They all look alike to me.

798
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:23,722
Which three
did you pick out, Newt?

799
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:27,025
I don't know. I can't spot them.

800
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,569
(applause)

801
00:40:37,603 --> 00:40:39,971
There they are; that's them.

802
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:41,940
*

803
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:58,423
Good scouting, buddy boy.

804
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:02,127
You could get rich
running a lonesome heart's club.

805
00:41:24,883 --> 00:41:26,818
*

806
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:34,626
(applause)

807
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,562
(whistling)

808
00:41:39,565 --> 00:41:41,667
*

809
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:12,030
*

810
00:42:30,315 --> 00:42:34,052
(whooping, cheering)

811
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:36,121
(music ends)

812
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:37,756
Levells, get backstage
on the double

813
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:39,625
and get them
out here for a drink,

814
00:42:39,658 --> 00:42:41,259
along with any other
little knick-knacks

815
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:42,527
you might run into.

816
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:44,429
Skip, order us some champagne.

817
00:42:44,462 --> 00:42:47,899
Champagne? You never used to
go for that fancy stuff.

818
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:50,068
Yes, I did,
every time I got promoted.

819
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:51,903
Well, you're not promoted yet
this time,

820
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:53,538
and I've been hoping
it won't happen.

821
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:55,941
Boy, you're getting
a hopelessly split personality.

822
00:42:55,974 --> 00:42:57,643
That's jealousy talking, buddy.

823
00:42:57,643 --> 00:42:59,244
No, it isn't jealously.

824
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:01,780
Just wouldn't appreciate
my type of genius.

825
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:03,414
That's why I've been
avoiding promotion.

826
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:07,886
Believe me, you'd be a lot
happier if you avoided it, too.

827
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,555
(speaking Japanese)

828
00:43:10,656 --> 00:43:13,491
Uh, me friend of, uh,
three sisters.

829
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,160
Uh, sisters.

830
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:17,128
(speaking Japanese)

831
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:34,846
Grace?

832
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:44,122
(speaking Japanese)

833
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:48,827
Grace? Grace?

834
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:57,703
(car drives off)

835
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,819
What's the matter, jughead?!

836
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:15,353
Haven't you got any manners?!

837
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,388
Oh, begging your pardon,
but you don't look like

838
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:19,991
any etiquette expert to me.

839
00:44:20,025 --> 00:44:22,327
Looks like we'll have to run
a red Chinese through this dump

840
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,795
to fumigate it
after this sea crab

841
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:25,496
gets through smelling it up.

842
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:27,165
Well, I guess that's gonna
call for a little lashing.

843
00:44:27,198 --> 00:44:28,366
-Who's first?
-Go get him.

844
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,735
Take your best shot, Marine.

845
00:44:29,735 --> 00:44:32,637
Come on, what are you gonna do?

846
00:44:32,738 --> 00:44:33,839
We got to be careful, Skip.

847
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:35,540
I got to remember tomorrow.

848
00:44:35,573 --> 00:44:37,008
On your way, sailor,
on your way.

849
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:39,745
Our dear Desmond
abhors violence.

850
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,249
Navy's landing, boys.

851
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:47,753
Situation well in hand.

852
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:49,320
How do you like that?

853
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:50,756
They're even
stealing our slogan.

854
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:52,423
Yeah, but we got to be careful.

855
00:44:52,457 --> 00:44:53,992
We got to remember tomorrow.

856
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,227
But, Skip, I know it was
a tough pill to swallow,

857
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:58,496
-but I can't go...
-But, but, but, but what?

858
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,165
Boy, you've hit a new low.

859
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,233
I'm telling you, you keep
this up, you can go to Demark

860
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:04,002
and get one of those
operations they do,

861
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,371
and when you come back,
we'll call you Peaches.

862
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:10,942
Pardon me while I wash my hands
of you, cutie.

863
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:20,118
Well, boys, have fun.

864
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:23,288
I got a man's job to do tonight.

865
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:28,927
Never trust a guy that keeps
his lip buttoned like that one.

866
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,029
Yeah, he's an oddball,
all right.

867
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:33,631
Give him a couple of whiffs
of cheap perfume

868
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:37,402
on some chesty broad, and
he'll go right over the hill.

869
00:45:38,804 --> 00:45:41,239
Hey, baby, wait a minute.
(whistles)

870
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,844
That gentleman there...

871
00:45:47,813 --> 00:45:50,215
...with the bottle...
(chugging)

872
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:52,717
you take.

873
00:45:52,818 --> 00:45:54,853
I go. You come, right?

874
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:02,961
Wonder what happened to Levells
with those, uh, three chicks?

875
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:04,095
Ah, who cares?

876
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:05,496
I'm too ashamed
to even face it.

877
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,832
They might have went back there

878
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:08,466
and got the birdie
from that sailor.

879
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:10,168
Just consider the source.

880
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:12,337
"Just consider
the source."

881
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:17,575
What's that?

882
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,477
How should I know?

883
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:25,316
(laughs)

884
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,085
-Hmm?
-It's another load of mush

885
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,087
from that Miss Peekaboo
at the bathhouse.

886
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,255
Listen.

887
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:33,524
"My Desmond, I have counted
the lonely hours

888
00:46:33,558 --> 00:46:35,760
"since my last missive to you.

889
00:46:35,861 --> 00:46:37,328
(laughs)

890
00:46:37,362 --> 00:46:42,868
"Your gorgeous image continues
to float before my eyes,

891
00:46:42,868 --> 00:46:45,436
"that tawny ripple of muscles

892
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:49,440
"like the waves which
softly kiss the golden sands.

893
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:51,776
-(laughs) -Got a real
seafaring flavor to it.

894
00:46:51,877 --> 00:46:53,144
Yeah, she's pretty salty, huh?

895
00:46:53,178 --> 00:46:56,781
"A short while ago,
I passed close by you

896
00:46:56,882 --> 00:46:59,050
and was tempted to touch you."

897
00:46:59,084 --> 00:47:01,286
She's here somewhere!

898
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:05,490
Hey. I got a hunch that note's a
rib from that sailor over there.

899
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:13,064
Hey, bellhops, have fun.

900
00:47:16,902 --> 00:47:19,537
Nah, only a broad
could get this poetical.

901
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:20,638
Listen.

902
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,573
"So perhaps the time draws near

903
00:47:22,607 --> 00:47:25,043
"when we shall meet
in breathless rendezvous,

904
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:28,546
"alone in some exotic bower
beside the sea.

905
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:29,580
(laughs)

906
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,986
Yours forever to be."

907
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,587
How's it signed this time?

908
00:47:36,621 --> 00:47:38,156
"S-Sea Nymph."

909
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,325
(laughs)

910
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,760
Sea Nymph,
all that nautical talk.

911
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,930
Let me see that thing.

912
00:47:49,267 --> 00:47:51,602
This is undeniably
a man's handwriting.

913
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:54,839
Look at it.

914
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:58,709
Yeah, well, it does look like
maybe some guy wrote it.

915
00:47:58,743 --> 00:48:00,946
Yeah, yeah, now I get the
picture.

916
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:02,247
The locker room, the baths--

917
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,749
I saw that same sailor
in the locker room.

918
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:06,952
-That guy?
-Yeah.

919
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:08,019
Why, that crumb.

920
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:09,587
Yeah, crumb.

921
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,090
Well, wait a minute, how did
he know my name was Desmond

922
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:13,959
until you just mentioned it
a couple of minutes ago?

923
00:48:13,959 --> 00:48:15,226
Well, he-he could've been

924
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,527
on some transport
with you somewhere.

925
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,363
-Go get him.
-Yeah, he remembers me.

926
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:20,031
He's trying to get even, huh?

927
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:22,367
Well, sure. Are you gonna let
him get away with this thing?

928
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,470
Go get him! Break up the joint!

929
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:26,637
Ah, wait a minute.

930
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:28,373
I can get him anytime.

931
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,541
I want to have
some fun tonight, Skip.

932
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:32,410
What happened to Levells
with those three chicks?

933
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:34,545
-(applause, fanfare plays)
-Nothing ever gets done

934
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:36,881
around here
unless I do it myself.

935
00:48:36,982 --> 00:48:39,017
(upbeat jazz music playing)

936
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,135
I give up. I give up!

937
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:59,237
Ought to retire
and become a scoutmaster.

938
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,007
Listen, Skip,
I hope he becomes a general.

939
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,110
The further it takes him away
from me, the better I like it.

940
00:49:29,034 --> 00:49:30,435
(speaking Japanese)

941
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:33,104
...uh, three little pussycats.

942
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:35,040
Ah? Pussycats, three.

943
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,542
(speaking Japanese)

944
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:40,645
(women giggling)

945
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,619
On your feet, Sea Nymph.

946
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:50,821
I've got a love letter here
for you.

947
00:49:50,855 --> 00:49:52,890
Get lost, Desmond.

948
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,325
You don't want to make me mad.

949
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:56,061
Oh, you're a tough guy, huh?

950
00:49:56,061 --> 00:49:57,362
Yeah.

951
00:49:57,395 --> 00:49:59,364
Well, you don't fool me, buddy,

952
00:49:59,397 --> 00:50:01,499
using these three girlies
to cover up.

953
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:03,301
Buster, what have you
been smoking?

954
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:04,535
I don't read you.

955
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:06,537
-Oh, you don't, huh?
-No.

956
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:09,174
Well, don't you like
my gorgeous image?

957
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:12,310
Are you still counting
the lonely hours,

958
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:16,681
or are your waves too busy
kissing the golden sands?

959
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:18,483
(grunts)

960
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,751
I don't take that kind of talk
from nobody.

961
00:50:20,785 --> 00:50:23,020
Oh, come on, sailor boy.

962
00:50:23,054 --> 00:50:25,156
Don't play foxy with me.

963
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,492
We read each other now,
don't we, huh?

964
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:30,395
You tipped yourself off when
you waved nighty-night at me

965
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:32,763
with your limp wrist, daffodil!

966
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:36,401
-Daffodil?
-Daffodil!

967
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:39,370
-Limp wrist?!
-Limp wrist!

968
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,543
I've killed guys
for less than that.

969
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:47,545
(women gasping)

970
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,518
Come on, cowpoke,
get up and fight.

971
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:54,785
Yeah, put it right here,
right here.

972
00:50:54,819 --> 00:50:55,853
See what you can do, come on.

973
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,322
Right there, come on. Right...

974
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,132
Come on, get up, will you?

975
00:51:07,165 --> 00:51:08,533
Come on. Come on.

976
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,601
Come on.

977
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:12,870
(women shrieking)

978
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,739
MAN:
Go on, baby, hit him!

979
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:18,143
(cheering)

980
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:21,779
(clamoring)

981
00:51:27,685 --> 00:51:29,620
(women shrieking)

982
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:37,528
-We send you in there!
-Oh!

983
00:51:39,264 --> 00:51:42,066
Look, you hide me, and if I get
out of this, I'll marry you.

984
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:44,068
-(women giggle)
-Get under the table!

985
00:51:44,169 --> 00:51:45,936
(women clamoring)

986
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,172
Hide him!

987
00:52:09,227 --> 00:52:12,797
Looks like he gave us the slip.

988
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:29,447
(chuckles)

989
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,117
All right, McCaffrey, let's go.

990
00:52:33,218 --> 00:52:34,619
(groans)

991
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:38,122
Well, I guess it's just as well
you found me here.

992
00:52:38,223 --> 00:52:39,790
I can show you more hospitality

993
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:42,727
than I could've
in our old hometown.

994
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,531
So many of these little luxuries
were frowned on there.

995
00:52:46,564 --> 00:52:47,798
What's yours, Newt?

996
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:49,234
Bourbon?

997
00:52:49,234 --> 00:52:51,569
Or I have some sake if you want
to go the Oriental route.

998
00:52:51,602 --> 00:52:53,338
I don't want anything.

999
00:52:54,705 --> 00:52:57,908
Well, here's to
the age of innocence, Newt.

1000
00:52:57,942 --> 00:53:00,511
The old days back home.

1001
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:06,517
That-that man I seen you with
tonight-- who was he?

1002
00:53:06,551 --> 00:53:08,986
Who knows? Who cares?

1003
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,257
Yeah, but what about
all the letters you wrote me?

1004
00:53:12,257 --> 00:53:13,991
They sounded just like
you used to be.

1005
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:18,896
I was preserving you, Newt,
as a hope of last resort.

1006
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:22,567
A dream of a day
when I might kick this all off

1007
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:25,570
and come home to the poor
but pious respectability

1008
00:53:25,603 --> 00:53:28,473
-of being Mrs. Newton Level.
-(phone ringing)

1009
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,177
But you had to find me
like this, didn't you?

1010
00:53:33,278 --> 00:53:35,780
That was a pretty shoddy
trick of fate.

1011
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:37,081
But what does it matter?

1012
00:53:37,114 --> 00:53:40,184
I probably never would have
gone home anyway.

1013
00:53:40,285 --> 00:53:42,287
Yes?

1014
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:44,054
Yes, I remember.

1015
00:53:44,088 --> 00:53:46,591
Where are you?

1016
00:53:46,624 --> 00:53:47,525
All right.

1017
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,427
It'll take me about 15 minutes.

1018
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:53,030
I have to change.

1019
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,599
Bye.

1020
00:53:54,632 --> 00:53:56,567
See you.

1021
00:53:58,303 --> 00:54:01,772
Newt, you better
pour yourself a drink.

1022
00:54:01,806 --> 00:54:04,375
I'm going to tell you
a few facts about life

1023
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:06,944
in a Japanese prison camp.

1024
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:11,081
It was nothing at all
like I wrote you.

1025
00:54:11,115 --> 00:54:15,085
A bit rough at first,
especially when mother died.

1026
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,923
But after that, the commanding
officer took a fancy to me

1027
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:20,625
and moved me to better quarters.

1028
00:54:20,658 --> 00:54:26,130
And then... there were
other officers, of course.

1029
00:54:26,163 --> 00:54:30,000
And finally, that quaint
little country girl named Grace

1030
00:54:30,034 --> 00:54:32,403
was only a far-gone memory.

1031
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:35,239
Oh, yes, it seems
that nature so favored me,

1032
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:38,909
there wasn't even
any more prison camp for me.

1033
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:42,413
I was moved to a higher echelon
of comforts in Tokyo.

1034
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:45,516
And then, when our
American conquerors arrived,

1035
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:48,486
I suffered no obvious hardships.

1036
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:51,489
That, of course,
is why I moved to Yokosuka,

1037
00:54:51,522 --> 00:54:55,025
to be near the larger base
of operations.

1038
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:56,694
For as you know, their...

1039
00:54:56,727 --> 00:55:00,765
generosity and their affection
is legendary.

1040
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:04,101
And you know
something else, Newt?

1041
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,636
I'm with it.

1042
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:11,809
You'll get a good, long stretch
in the brig, McCaffrey.

1043
00:55:11,842 --> 00:55:15,780
I'm preparing my report
to your commanding officer.

1044
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:18,282
Gunnery Sergeant Hawkins will be
the chief witness against you.

1045
00:55:18,383 --> 00:55:19,950
Right, sir.

1046
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:22,152
He was up for promotion, but of
course that's a dead issue now.

1047
00:55:22,186 --> 00:55:26,123
I've been watching you
ever since Guadalcanal,

1048
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:30,127
through Iwo Jima and Okinawa
to the landings of Inchon.

1049
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,397
And I've never seen
a better fighting man

1050
00:55:32,397 --> 00:55:34,532
or a more troublesome citizen.

1051
00:55:34,565 --> 00:55:36,801
I'm sorry, sir,
but like I always say,

1052
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:38,636
furloughs is my worst enemy.

1053
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,405
There's such a thing
as battle fatigue.

1054
00:55:40,405 --> 00:55:41,406
Doesn't that bother you?

1055
00:55:41,439 --> 00:55:43,841
No, sir, just furlough fatigue.

1056
00:55:47,512 --> 00:55:49,213
For a long time,
I've shared the delusion

1057
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:50,981
with Gunny Hawkins and others
that there might be

1058
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:53,418
noncommissioned officer material
in you.

1059
00:55:53,418 --> 00:55:57,588
Although, you never were quite
my idea of the all-American boy.

1060
00:55:57,622 --> 00:55:59,023
In the well-rounded Marine,

1061
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:01,892
the guts to storm
an enemy position is essential,

1062
00:56:01,926 --> 00:56:03,994
but that isn't
the only requirement.

1063
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:05,696
He must reflect credit
on the service

1064
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,432
in the public walks of life.

1065
00:56:07,432 --> 00:56:08,899
I realize that, sir.

1066
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:10,735
However, you won't be deprived
of your medal.

1067
00:56:10,768 --> 00:56:13,170
You won that
before your trip to Japan.

1068
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,506
I understand your commanding
officer has requested

1069
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,207
these decorations
be presented here.

1070
00:56:17,241 --> 00:56:18,543
Yes, sir, Captain.

1071
00:56:18,576 --> 00:56:19,944
And it will soon be time
for the formation.

1072
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:22,179
Well, then you'd better be
on your way.

1073
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,849
And get that hangdog look
off your face, McCaffrey.

1074
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:27,518
At least you've earned
this chance to be proud.

1075
00:56:27,552 --> 00:56:29,720
March out, McCaffrey!

1076
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:35,059
*

1077
00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:51,942
Thank you, sir.

1078
00:56:53,277 --> 00:56:54,912
Gunny, you don't figure
they'll carry this

1079
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:56,581
-as far as a court-martial?
-How should I know?

1080
00:56:56,614 --> 00:56:58,215
You've been in trouble before;

1081
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,050
you ought to be an expert
on these things by this time.

1082
00:57:00,084 --> 00:57:01,652
Yeah, well, my intentions
are always good.

1083
00:57:01,686 --> 00:57:03,320
There's an old saw that says
the road to hell

1084
00:57:03,488 --> 00:57:04,722
is paved with good intentions.

1085
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,223
Meanwhile, the provost marshal
is allowing you

1086
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,291
to remain on technical liberty.

1087
00:57:07,324 --> 00:57:08,626
So be careful, Let's Go,

1088
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:11,228
and don't dig yourself
in any deeper.

1089
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,897
Or let me put it this way.

1090
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,900
I've never had a real honeymoon,
so do me the personal favor

1091
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,769
of allowing me to spend
a few hours with my wife.

1092
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:22,740
Hey, come on, buddy,
let's shove off.

1093
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:24,341
Time's a-wasting.

1094
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:27,177
Well, that's all over, Ellen.

1095
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:30,548
Let's shove out of here
and have a real honeymoon.

1096
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:34,752
Our marriage certificate.
Why'd you dig that up?

1097
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,287
Just to jam it down the throat
of that stuffy proprietor

1098
00:57:37,321 --> 00:57:38,923
at the White Dove.

1099
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:41,526
I'm going to make him let us in,
even without our suitcase.

1100
00:57:41,526 --> 00:57:43,761
Attagirl, Ellen,
you tell him off.

1101
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,696
All right, where's the driver
for this heap?

1102
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:46,697
-Let's go!
-(horn blaring)

1103
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:47,865
Sorry to hear it, Mac.

1104
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:49,600
Looks like
you lost your promotion.

1105
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:52,002
Yeah, it's a load off my mind
even if does mean the brig.

1106
00:57:52,036 --> 00:57:53,704
Well, it's made him
a real buddy again.

1107
00:57:53,738 --> 00:57:55,272
Frankly, I haven't been
so delighted

1108
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,307
since that widow in Manila
named the twins McCaffrey.

1109
00:57:57,341 --> 00:57:59,644
Well, that's the motto of
the McCaffrey club, isn't it?

1110
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:00,978
All for one and one for all?

1111
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:02,547
Don't be a wise guy, Chatfield.

1112
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,214
All right, you guys,
come on now, ante up.

1113
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:07,017
We got to pay that hotel bill
while we still got some dough.

1114
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:10,555
Speaking of dough, where
I'm going, I don't need it.

1115
00:58:10,588 --> 00:58:12,823
-So long, boys.
-Okay, yeah.

1116
00:58:12,857 --> 00:58:14,559
Boy, he's still talking
like a gyrene

1117
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:15,960
that's about
to go over the hill.

1118
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:17,461
Pete, you better bird-dog him.

1119
00:58:17,562 --> 00:58:19,463
-Okay.
-Yeah, Pete.

1120
00:58:19,564 --> 00:58:21,231
I promised Gunny
no more foul-ups.

1121
00:58:21,265 --> 00:58:23,167
Now we're gonna leave this truck
at the hotel.

1122
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,035
I'd appreciate it if you'd do
a little cruising tonight

1123
00:58:25,069 --> 00:58:27,004
-and keep an eye on the guys.
-I'll have a guy

1124
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:29,306
on the Red Fox shortwave
in case you need us.

1125
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,141
Right-o.

1126
00:58:31,175 --> 00:58:33,210
Where you going,
you Plymouth Rock capon?

1127
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,813
Why, just so I shan't disappoint
you, McCaffrey, I thought I'd go

1128
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,015
to the blood bank
to see if mine's still blue.

1129
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:40,017
Very funny.

1130
00:58:41,752 --> 00:58:43,253
Snap out of it, Levells.

1131
00:58:43,287 --> 00:58:47,191
Keep looking for that broad;
you'll find her yet.

1132
00:58:47,224 --> 00:58:49,226
I found her.

1133
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,764
What a bunch I got here--

1134
00:58:53,798 --> 00:58:57,735
busted Romeos, free lovers,
financials wizards,

1135
00:58:57,768 --> 00:59:00,004
and that cutie Chatfield
who come over on the Mayflower.

1136
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,006
To say nothing
of the big balloon brain

1137
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:04,174
who keeps us all in a jam.
Come on, give me some dough.

1138
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,076
Yeah, well, no more.
I've had it, boy.

1139
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:08,378
-No more pub-crawling
for your uncle Mac. -Oh?

1140
00:59:08,412 --> 00:59:11,882
Just a nice quiet evening
at home with a nice family.

1141
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:14,351
You mean those,
uh, Sagita sisters

1142
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,686
from the, uh, Gaiety Club?

1143
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,187
(laughs) You guess good.

1144
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:18,723
Oh, I can see it all now.

1145
00:59:18,756 --> 00:59:20,725
Just them and you and me

1146
00:59:20,758 --> 00:59:23,360
sitting around with
our shoes off, drinking tea.

1147
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:26,196
Not you, buster.

1148
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,965
Go shoot your own quail.

1149
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:30,635
You'll miss me;
I'm the life of every party.

1150
00:59:30,668 --> 00:59:32,536
Like you were in Honolulu?

1151
00:59:32,637 --> 00:59:36,106
Telling every ugly broad on
Waikiki Beach that you were me?

1152
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:36,907
(laughs)

1153
00:59:36,941 --> 00:59:38,308
My phone never stopped ringing.

1154
00:59:38,342 --> 00:59:39,744
Oh.

1155
00:59:39,777 --> 00:59:42,913
But seeing what a fall guy
you made out of me,

1156
00:59:42,947 --> 00:59:44,982
-I'll let you get yourself
on the hook. -Hmm?

1157
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:46,383
-I'll give you a buildup.
-Hmm?

1158
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,652
They want to get married.

1159
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:49,720
Oh, no, thanks.
I'll do my own selling.

1160
00:59:49,754 --> 00:59:51,555
Okay, write them a note,
and I'll deliver it

1161
00:59:51,656 --> 00:59:53,290
and tell them how great you are.

1162
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:54,659
And if they want you aboard,

1163
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:56,293
I'll give you a buzz
at the hotel.

1164
00:59:56,326 --> 01:00:00,164
But right now, buddy, I'm gonna
make a date for yours truly.

1165
01:00:00,197 --> 01:00:02,900
Ahso. Ha, ha.

1166
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:05,569
Hey, Boy-san, psst, come here.

1167
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,238
You got the writer paper?
Write-oh?

1168
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:10,207
(speaks Japanese)

1169
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:19,049
(speaking Japanese)

1170
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,595
Hello.

1171
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,164
Uh, which one is this?

1172
01:00:34,198 --> 01:00:35,666
Oh, Su Me.

1173
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:39,003
Hello, baby. This is big,
handsome Marine boy, remember?

1174
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:42,707
Oh, big, handsome
under table boy?

1175
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:46,610
No show tonight.

1176
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,179
You come here, our house.

1177
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:52,116
Okay, baby, will do.

1178
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:54,118
Start cooking up the tea
and the sake,

1179
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:57,321
and I'll be right over as soon
as I can change my socks.

1180
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:59,323
Sayonara, baby. (kisses)

1181
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:06,997
(whistling tune)

1182
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:10,735
Give this
to those three dollies.

1183
01:01:10,735 --> 01:01:13,738
That note will
get me in anywhere.

1184
01:01:13,738 --> 01:01:15,305
-(laughs)
-(engine starts)

1185
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:17,007
Go.

1186
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:25,315
SONG DO: "My dear one, I'm happy 
 that you are away from danger,

1187
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:28,485
"though my heart 
 cries out for you.

1188
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:32,489
"Each day, I stand 
 looking across the torn land

1189
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,992
"where I first saw you,

1190
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:38,763
"and I try to dream 
 that you are there.

1191
01:01:38,763 --> 01:01:41,365
"But it is strangely empty now,

1192
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:45,035
"and there is a great 
 and frightening stillness,

1193
01:01:45,069 --> 01:01:47,905
"as though the world 
 were catching its breath

1194
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:50,507
"to make again 
 the fire and thunder

1195
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,778
"more terrible than before.

1196
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:56,613
"And so I fall 
 at the Lotus throne

1197
01:01:56,646 --> 01:02:00,217
"and pray that my visions 
 of terror are false,

1198
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:03,287
"that there will be 
 life and peace

1199
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:06,456
"and the nirvana 
 of our love forever.

1200
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:08,125
(playing melody)

1201
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:10,694
"Then suddenly again, 
 I'm filled with the faith

1202
01:02:10,795 --> 01:02:15,399
that sings in my heart to the 
 happy music of the komungo."

1203
01:02:18,903 --> 01:02:21,005
(melody continues)

1204
01:02:33,818 --> 01:02:35,920
*

1205
01:03:00,845 --> 01:03:02,980
(speaking Japanese)

1206
01:03:14,892 --> 01:03:16,293
(laughter)

1207
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:19,296
Marine boy very good
with Japanese custom.

1208
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:21,498
(laughs)
You can say that again, baby.

1209
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:24,334
We're gonna have quite a night
tonight, huh? (laughs)

1210
01:03:24,368 --> 01:03:25,903
(speaking Japanese)

1211
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,610
(laughs)

1212
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:36,480
(speaking Japanese)

1213
01:03:46,090 --> 01:03:48,192
Our bother, Fuji.

1214
01:03:48,225 --> 01:03:49,894
-Brother?
-Yes.

1215
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:51,962
We're proud of him.

1216
01:03:51,996 --> 01:03:55,665
He's a wrestler,
champion of all Japan.

1217
01:03:55,699 --> 01:03:57,902
(speaking Japanese)

1218
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,216
(conversation continues
in Japanese)

1219
01:04:14,919 --> 01:04:17,054
Did I? Yeah, that's...

1220
01:04:17,087 --> 01:04:19,056
Oh, yeah, I did. (chuckles)

1221
01:04:19,089 --> 01:04:21,825
Uh, uh, Su Me, Su Me! Yeah.

1222
01:04:21,926 --> 01:04:23,827
(speaking Japanese)

1223
01:04:23,928 --> 01:04:25,495
Sake? Yeah, I could use one.

1224
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:28,832
You got one?

1225
01:04:28,933 --> 01:04:30,400
(women giggling)

1226
01:04:39,243 --> 01:04:42,179
Trophies of brother Fuji,

1227
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:45,582
all for victory
in many festivals.

1228
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:48,352
Gold samurai sword

1229
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:51,521
presented by the government

1230
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:56,860
for breaking neck
of Chinese champion.

1231
01:04:56,961 --> 01:04:59,063
(both laugh)

1232
01:05:00,965 --> 01:05:03,200
(speaking Japanese)

1233
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,335
(women speaking Japanese)

1234
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:15,045
(women giggling)

1235
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:17,781
Have a nice, big home
in America?

1236
01:05:17,814 --> 01:05:19,649
Yeah, yeah, Camp Pendleton.

1237
01:05:19,683 --> 01:05:22,052
(women giggling)

1238
01:05:22,086 --> 01:05:26,390
Well, this is quite a setup
you got here, Fuji.

1239
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:29,559
Uh, wrestling racket
must be pretty good here.

1240
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:32,997
(laughter)

1241
01:05:34,831 --> 01:05:37,734
Here, have a cigar, Fuji.

1242
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,737
Old man Churchill sends me
a box of those every Christmas.

1243
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,007
We're buddies. (laughs)

1244
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,778
(sighs)

1245
01:05:48,812 --> 01:05:50,480
Fuji, how would you like to have

1246
01:05:50,514 --> 01:05:52,582
another American
for a brother-in-law?

1247
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:56,086
He's not as good-looking as I
am, but he's got a lot of money.

1248
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,255
He's got a big estate
called Fort Knox.

1249
01:05:58,288 --> 01:05:59,356
(speaking Japanese)

1250
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:03,093
But, you see, he's a little shy.

1251
01:06:03,127 --> 01:06:05,462
He likes to send in
his references first, see,

1252
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:08,765
so he don't get his feelings
hurt if he ain't welcome.

1253
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,834
Uh, dig this.

1254
01:06:10,867 --> 01:06:14,938
"Most lovely and illustrious
flowers of Nippon,

1255
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:21,111
you are the blinding beauty in
the secret garden of my heart."

1256
01:06:21,145 --> 01:06:23,113
(speaking Japanese)

1257
01:06:23,147 --> 01:06:25,515
Yeah, he really hates himself,
doesn't he?

1258
01:06:25,549 --> 01:06:26,816
Uh, dig this.

1259
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:28,352
"I pine to make
your acquaintance

1260
01:06:28,385 --> 01:06:30,187
"and hope the following
qualifications

1261
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,722
"may strike a note
of-of response in you.

1262
01:06:32,756 --> 01:06:36,426
I have often been referred to
as the Greek god type."

1263
01:06:39,196 --> 01:06:41,131
"Greek god type."

1264
01:06:41,165 --> 01:06:43,300
I've heard that one before.

1265
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:45,735
He make nice word music.

1266
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:49,073
Yeah, honey, but I got a hunch
this guy's only got one tune.

1267
01:06:49,073 --> 01:06:52,476
"However, if it is the higher
ideal of manhood which you seek,

1268
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:55,145
"gentile of manners,
profound of mind,

1269
01:06:55,179 --> 01:06:56,580
"and with the rippling muscles

1270
01:06:56,613 --> 01:07:01,151
like the waves which kiss
the golden sands..."

1271
01:07:01,185 --> 01:07:04,088
"Rippling muscles."

1272
01:07:04,088 --> 01:07:06,423
"Golden sands."

1273
01:07:06,456 --> 01:07:08,825
"...then I shall feed
your heart's desire

1274
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,095
"in some breathless rendezvous

1275
01:07:11,128 --> 01:07:14,431
with only the pale moon
to spy upon us."

1276
01:07:17,101 --> 01:07:18,602
Rippling muscles, huh?

1277
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:20,537
Golden sands.

1278
01:07:22,606 --> 01:07:23,940
That's it.

1279
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:26,009
He's the Sea Nymph.

1280
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:27,177
Where's the telephone?

1281
01:07:27,211 --> 01:07:29,279
In trophy room.

1282
01:07:29,313 --> 01:07:32,749
When I go to America,
I bring whole family.

1283
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,792
Hotel Okamoto.

1284
01:07:47,131 --> 01:07:49,233
R-Red Fox headquarters.

1285
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:54,538
Skip, this you?

1286
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:57,207
Hey, listen, buddy, I don't know
what you wrote in that letter,

1287
01:07:57,241 --> 01:07:59,143
but you sure hit the jackpot.

1288
01:07:59,143 --> 01:08:00,544
Get over here on the double.

1289
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:03,147
It's 318, just around the corner
from the hotel.

1290
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:04,748
And, listen, the door's open.

1291
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:06,983
Walk right in. Okay?

1292
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:08,485
See you, buddy.

1293
01:08:11,155 --> 01:08:13,257
(whistling quietly)

1294
01:08:22,866 --> 01:08:24,334
Yeah.

1295
01:08:27,704 --> 01:08:30,474
Well, folks,
I got bad news for you.

1296
01:08:30,507 --> 01:08:32,642
-The wedding's all off.
-(speaking Japanese)

1297
01:08:32,676 --> 01:08:34,578
My buddy just tipped me off
on the phone

1298
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:37,281
that the provost marshal's on
his way over here to arrest me.

1299
01:08:37,314 --> 01:08:38,748
For fighting in club last night?

1300
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:40,016
Yeah, that's right.

1301
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:42,519
Just when I thought I had it
all squared away, too.

1302
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:44,921
And then this copper,
he frames me just because

1303
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,090
we had an argument
about the wrestling racket.

1304
01:08:47,191 --> 01:08:49,092
(speaking Japanese)

1305
01:08:49,193 --> 01:08:50,927
That's what I told him, Fuji.

1306
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,696
Naturally, your name came up,

1307
01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:55,799
and that's when I chewed him out
for calling you a big phony.

1308
01:08:55,832 --> 01:08:57,701
(speaking Japanese)

1309
01:08:57,734 --> 01:08:59,703
(grunts)

1310
01:08:59,736 --> 01:09:01,838
(speaking Japanese)

1311
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:04,208
That's right, Fuji.
Give him the full treatment!

1312
01:09:04,241 --> 01:09:06,042
Rip, bam, wham!

1313
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:08,212
(speaking Japanese)

1314
01:09:10,214 --> 01:09:12,249
SKIP:
Hey, McCaffrey!

1315
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:25,795
(grunts)

1316
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,331
What's he doing?

1317
01:09:27,364 --> 01:09:30,767
Getting ready
to break neck of your enemy.

1318
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:42,145
Hey, McCaffrey!

1319
01:09:42,246 --> 01:09:43,380
Hey, Mac!

1320
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,855
Ahso.

1321
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:56,025
Uh, hi there.

1322
01:09:56,059 --> 01:09:57,661
(laughs)

1323
01:09:57,694 --> 01:09:59,996
Uh, uh...

1324
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,665
Roth! Uh, Roth, my name.

1325
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:03,733
Uh, U.S. Marine Corps.
Glad to meet you.

1326
01:10:03,767 --> 01:10:05,602
I seemed to have,
uh, stumbled into

1327
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:07,170
the little old
wrong doorway here.

1328
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:08,605
I guess I'll be going now.

1329
01:10:08,638 --> 01:10:10,274
Uh, uh...

1330
01:10:10,307 --> 01:10:11,275
Good night.

1331
01:10:11,308 --> 01:10:14,511
Um, so sorry.

1332
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:15,779
(yells)

1333
01:10:18,582 --> 01:10:21,851
-Hey, now, look, you got
the wrong idea, buddy! -(grunts)

1334
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:23,420
Hey, now,
let's talk this over, bud.

1335
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:24,888
Let's get to know each other.
I mean...

1336
01:10:24,921 --> 01:10:26,055
-(grunts)
-(screams)

1337
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:28,024
Now, wait a minute, buster!

1338
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,459
I don't want to lose my temper.

1339
01:10:29,493 --> 01:10:31,528
-I don't want to have to
hurt you. -(yells)

1340
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:34,531
Hey, McCaffrey,
this guy is gonna kill me!

1341
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:37,667
(laughter, shouting)

1342
01:10:43,307 --> 01:10:45,275
Get him, Fuji!

1343
01:10:45,309 --> 01:10:47,444
(laughter, shouting continue)

1344
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:56,052
Don't forget your shoes, Roth!

1345
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,288
(laughter)

1346
01:10:58,322 --> 01:11:01,425
No more trouble.
We have wedding soon.

1347
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:02,892
Yeah, yeah, uh... (chuckles)

1348
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:04,994
I think I'll go get
the license, honey.

1349
01:11:05,028 --> 01:11:06,930
(laughter)

1350
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,682
(laughs)

1351
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:27,651
*

1352
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,461
Frisk him.

1353
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,364
Come on, honey, let's dance.

1354
01:11:40,397 --> 01:11:41,865
I don't want to dance.

1355
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:43,533
Come on.

1356
01:12:05,422 --> 01:12:07,056
(laughing)

1357
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:09,025
Poor Skip.

1358
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:13,062
Give me the pass key.
I lost mine.

1359
01:12:13,096 --> 01:12:14,998
-Yes, sir.
-(laughing)

1360
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:18,301
Ah, Mr. Red Fox employee
create system.

1361
01:12:18,402 --> 01:12:19,703
Very good.

1362
01:12:19,736 --> 01:12:22,305
Yeah, I'm using
my old noodle tonight, Yoshida.

1363
01:12:22,406 --> 01:12:25,241
(laughs)

1364
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:27,644
Mr. Red Fox very clever.

1365
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:31,548
Smart as famous
Japanese detective, Mr. Moto.

1366
01:12:31,581 --> 01:12:34,951
Have nose like
bloodhound dog, huh?

1367
01:12:57,441 --> 01:12:58,875
(burps)

1368
01:13:06,983 --> 01:13:08,918
(shouts in Japanese)

1369
01:13:12,589 --> 01:13:15,058
(shrieking)

1370
01:13:17,661 --> 01:13:19,796
(shouting in Japanese)

1371
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,711
You demented baboon!

1372
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,613
What are you, nuts,
trying to get me killed?!

1373
01:13:36,646 --> 01:13:39,783
Oh, that'd be a big loss
to the art world,

1374
01:13:39,816 --> 01:13:42,218
wouldn't it, you privy poet?

1375
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,887
What are you talking about?

1376
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,789
"Greek god."

1377
01:13:45,822 --> 01:13:46,790
(laughs)

1378
01:13:46,823 --> 01:13:48,224
"Kissing the golden sands."

1379
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:49,493
(laughs)

1380
01:13:49,493 --> 01:13:51,761
"With only the pale moon
to spy on you."

1381
01:13:51,795 --> 01:13:53,630
-(laughs)
-You dirty,

1382
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:55,799
double-dealing, Sea Nymph!

1383
01:13:55,832 --> 01:13:56,600
(laughs)

1384
01:13:56,633 --> 01:13:57,834
Okay, okay.

1385
01:13:57,867 --> 01:13:59,603
You can't even take a joke.

1386
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:01,938
You had to set a hired
bone-crusher on me, huh?

1387
01:14:01,971 --> 01:14:04,574
Well, let me tell you this,
buster, I finally caught up with

1388
01:14:04,608 --> 01:14:07,010
that Oriental tub of lard,
and I laid him out flat.

1389
01:14:07,043 --> 01:14:07,811
Ha!

1390
01:14:07,844 --> 01:14:09,312
Tell me another fairy tale.

1391
01:14:09,345 --> 01:14:11,515
Okay, come on, that does it!

1392
01:14:11,548 --> 01:14:13,850
Hey, McCaffrey,
Blue Boy's calling Red Fox,

1393
01:14:13,883 --> 01:14:17,420
and it sounds like an S.O.S.

1394
01:14:17,521 --> 01:14:20,590
Hello, Blue Boy.
This is Red Fox. Over.

1395
01:14:20,624 --> 01:14:22,526
(over radio):
I hear you, Red Fox. Listen.

1396
01:14:22,526 --> 01:14:24,794
Newt's been nicked and
they're all at the All Nations.

1397
01:14:24,828 --> 01:14:26,596
We've been trying
to get his money back,

1398
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:29,265
but we met heavy
enemy resistance. Over.

1399
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,600
The All Nations, you say?

1400
01:14:30,634 --> 01:14:31,935
Griff Plummer's joint?

1401
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:34,538
Yes. We need reinforcements
on the double.

1402
01:14:34,538 --> 01:14:36,372
Reinforcements on the way. Out.

1403
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:39,208
-All right, get your gear.
Let's go. -Right.

1404
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,680
So the keeper of the White Dove

1405
01:14:43,713 --> 01:14:45,782
wouldn't go for
our wedding certificate.

1406
01:14:45,815 --> 01:14:47,851
Well, this is my idea
of a honeymoon heaven.

1407
01:14:47,884 --> 01:14:49,619
The chief didn't even
ask us to register.

1408
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:53,189
Well, you talk like you've had
experience in such matters.

1409
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:55,158
Always glad to have
Marine boy back again.

1410
01:14:55,191 --> 01:14:56,860
He don't know
what he's talking about.

1411
01:14:56,893 --> 01:14:58,695
I've never been here before.

1412
01:14:58,728 --> 01:15:00,564
So sorry, so sorry.

1413
01:15:00,564 --> 01:15:03,299
Much apology. Have room key.

1414
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:04,901
Boy, these guys, I don't know.

1415
01:15:04,934 --> 01:15:07,637
They see one guy in uniform,
and then every guy they see

1416
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:09,138
is the same guy.

1417
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:11,240
On my word of honor,
I've never been here before.

1418
01:15:11,274 --> 01:15:13,209
(speaking Japanese)

1419
01:15:15,579 --> 01:15:17,346
What's he saying?

1420
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,848
They're in trouble again.

1421
01:15:18,882 --> 01:15:21,317
They've left the hotel
with a walkie-talkie.

1422
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:22,819
Where are they?

1423
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,989
(speaking Japanese)

1424
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,992
Right off Takari Street
on the Ginza.

1425
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:31,928
Tell him to go find them and
then call me at headquarters.

1426
01:15:31,961 --> 01:15:35,231
I'm sorry, Ellen,
I'll be right back.

1427
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:37,200
(speaking Japanese)

1428
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:43,506
(sighs)

1429
01:15:43,607 --> 01:15:45,642
*

1430
01:15:49,045 --> 01:15:50,346
Hold it.

1431
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:53,349
This place is out of bounds
for you fellas. Beat it.

1432
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,752
How do you like that, Pete?

1433
01:15:55,785 --> 01:15:57,921
(women shrieking)

1434
01:15:59,789 --> 01:16:01,625
Go to sleep, you bum.

1435
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,226
Hey, McCaffrey!

1436
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:04,360
Take it easy, Mac.

1437
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,929
Long time, no see, Plummer.

1438
01:16:05,962 --> 01:16:08,431
Not since New Zealand
when I knocked your brains out.

1439
01:16:08,464 --> 01:16:09,866
Oh, you got lucky.

1440
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:11,901
Get out of here
before I call the MPs.

1441
01:16:11,935 --> 01:16:13,637
You'll call the MPs?

1442
01:16:13,637 --> 01:16:16,205
Why, you big, cheap,
jugheaded louse.

1443
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:18,908
Headquarters, headquarters,
Blue Boy, Blue Boy.

1444
01:16:18,942 --> 01:16:20,910
Red Fox calling Blue Boy.

1445
01:16:20,944 --> 01:16:22,746
(over radio): This is
Blue Boy at headquarters.

1446
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:24,213
Proceed, Red Fox.

1447
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:26,916
Say, Captain, we're in
a clip joint down here.

1448
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:30,086
The place looks like
a nest of red female spies.

1449
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:32,221
They knocked down one of our men
with cheap liquor

1450
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:33,723
and rolled him. Over.

1451
01:16:33,757 --> 01:16:36,893
Select some good samples, and
I'll run them through the lab.

1452
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,427
And pick up the suspects.

1453
01:16:38,461 --> 01:16:40,129
Bring them in, and I'll
interrogate them personally.

1454
01:16:40,163 --> 01:16:40,930
Over.

1455
01:16:40,964 --> 01:16:43,399
Will do, Captain. Out.

1456
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:46,135
L-Look, you guys,
I-I got real 90-proof here.

1457
01:16:46,169 --> 01:16:48,071
-Yeah. -Leave me alone,
I'll give you some.

1458
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:49,973
Okay, we'll take
a couple of cases of scotch,

1459
01:16:50,006 --> 01:16:51,941
a couple of cases of bourbon
and some gin.

1460
01:16:51,975 --> 01:16:53,242
And if it checks up all right,

1461
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:54,744
we won't put you off-limits,
Plummer!

1462
01:16:54,778 --> 01:16:56,345
Pete, go with him!

1463
01:16:56,379 --> 01:16:58,748
All right, you in the gold
dress, and you, and you, Red!

1464
01:16:58,782 --> 01:17:00,349
Come on, all of you!
You're all under arrest.

1465
01:17:00,383 --> 01:17:01,951
That's good intelligence,
McCaffrey; they all look guilty.

1466
01:17:01,985 --> 01:17:03,687
And we'll take
that jukebox, too.

1467
01:17:03,687 --> 01:17:05,955
That looks like it might have
a few hidden documents in it.

1468
01:17:05,989 --> 01:17:07,090
-Come on, out!
-All right, ladies.

1469
01:17:07,123 --> 01:17:08,524
Come on. Let's move along now.

1470
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:09,693
-Out, out, out!
-Come on, here we go.

1471
01:17:14,397 --> 01:17:15,765
Captain, sir.

1472
01:17:15,799 --> 01:17:17,366
Red Fox again?

1473
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,869
Yes, sir, Blue Boy, sir--
I mean, Captain Sampson, sir.

1474
01:17:19,903 --> 01:17:22,338
Self-control, Perkins,
self-control.

1475
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:23,439
Don't break down.

1476
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:24,708
Look at me. I'm doing fine!

1477
01:17:24,708 --> 01:17:25,842
Yes, sir.

1478
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:27,944
But wait till you hear
the latest.

1479
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:29,713
They've just raided
a nest of spies.

1480
01:17:29,746 --> 01:17:31,014
What's that?

1481
01:17:31,047 --> 01:17:32,782
Someone going over my head?

1482
01:17:32,816 --> 01:17:34,718
Oh, no, sir.

1483
01:17:34,718 --> 01:17:36,786
They say you're gonna
test the liquor

1484
01:17:36,820 --> 01:17:38,354
and personally inspect
some females.

1485
01:17:38,387 --> 01:17:40,456
You don't believe that,
do you, Perkins?

1486
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,792
Oh, no, sir.

1487
01:17:42,826 --> 01:17:44,360
Oh, yes, you do.

1488
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:47,797
How long has it been
since you've had a good rest?

1489
01:17:47,831 --> 01:17:52,535
Captain, my last leave was over
a year ago, but I'm all right.

1490
01:17:52,568 --> 01:17:54,637
I-I'm all right.

1491
01:17:54,738 --> 01:17:56,472
That is, I think I'm all right.

1492
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:57,640
Captain Sampson, sir.

1493
01:17:57,741 --> 01:17:59,408
I just received
a telephone call,

1494
01:17:59,442 --> 01:18:02,245
and I believe it's the answer
to the problem he's discussing.

1495
01:18:02,278 --> 01:18:04,213
(men murmuring)

1496
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:07,984
-You okay?
-* Oh, when the saints

1497
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:09,652
* Go marching in

1498
01:18:09,753 --> 01:18:11,154
-No, no, no.
-* Oh, when the...

1499
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:14,023
Extreme purities,
motto of Hotel Okamoto.

1500
01:18:14,057 --> 01:18:17,026
Woman characters very
shady-looking. Cannot permit.

1501
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,561
Oh, now don't blow your cork,
Yoshida,

1502
01:18:18,594 --> 01:18:20,263
till you hear the good news.

1503
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:22,165
Tonight's a night that'll
go down in the history of Japan.

1504
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:23,767
We wrapped up the spy ring.

1505
01:18:23,767 --> 01:18:25,334
-Spies, woman species?
-(speaks Japanese)

1506
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:27,570
Yeah, they're the most
dangerous kind.

1507
01:18:27,603 --> 01:18:28,905
All right, Skip,
take them upstairs

1508
01:18:28,938 --> 01:18:31,240
and interrogate them
and search them.

1509
01:18:31,274 --> 01:18:32,508
Come on.

1510
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:35,444
Go.

1511
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:36,780
Congratulations!

1512
01:18:36,813 --> 01:18:39,015
Congratulation to me?

1513
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:41,951
You're an honorary member
of our successful mission.

1514
01:18:41,985 --> 01:18:43,887
Ah, delightful honor
to be member

1515
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,621
of intelligence secret service.

1516
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:50,193
Yeah, and it's an all-American
custom to throw a victory ball.

1517
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:52,528
Now, bring all
your friends, okay?

1518
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,798
Our party is your party, okay?

1519
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:55,932
-Yes.
-Okay?

1520
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:57,433
-Okay.
-Okay.

1521
01:18:57,466 --> 01:18:59,402
(bottles clinking)

1522
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:02,806
(siren wailing)

1523
01:19:10,947 --> 01:19:12,916
(laughter, excited chatter)

1524
01:19:12,949 --> 01:19:14,918
Hey, hold it, hey!

1525
01:19:14,951 --> 01:19:16,719
Pipe down! Quiet it down!

1526
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:18,221
Hey, hey, everybody!

1527
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:19,155
Hey, hold it!

1528
01:19:19,188 --> 01:19:20,489
-Pipe down, Skip.
-What?

1529
01:19:20,523 --> 01:19:21,557
-(chatter quiets)
-Hmm.

1530
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:24,060
I want to give a toast.

1531
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:27,396
Here's to the wonderful...

1532
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:29,232
wonderful, uh...

1533
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:31,835
Wonderful friendship
between America and Japan.

1534
01:19:31,835 --> 01:19:33,569
Yeah, yeah, that's it, yeah.

1535
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:37,073
And also to Yoshida,

1536
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:40,409
who made our wonderful stay
so wonderful

1537
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:42,245
in his family hotel.

1538
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:45,481
-Yoshida.
-(cheering)

1539
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:47,016
That boy, Yoshida...

1540
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:49,953
Hey, al-also, also,

1541
01:19:49,986 --> 01:19:53,156
to this wonderful
honeymoon couple,

1542
01:19:53,189 --> 01:19:56,525
who-who I'm sorry hadn't
much chance to get acquainted!

1543
01:19:56,559 --> 01:19:59,028
(laughter)

1544
01:19:59,062 --> 01:20:02,198
Mac, that was wonderful.

1545
01:20:02,231 --> 01:20:04,267
-(laughs): Yeah.
-Now, can all this noise

1546
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,202
and let's get down
to some serious drinking here.

1547
01:20:06,235 --> 01:20:07,971
Yeah, drink up! Drink up!

1548
01:20:08,004 --> 01:20:09,172
(laughter, excited chatter)

1549
01:20:09,205 --> 01:20:12,275
(whooping)

1550
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:15,778
I tear up remainder
of hotel bill,

1551
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:19,615
in name of
international goodwill.

1552
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:20,950
(cheering)

1553
01:20:20,984 --> 01:20:22,818
Yoshida! Mr. Moto!

1554
01:20:22,852 --> 01:20:24,620
-Wonderful!
-A very gentlemanly thing to do!

1555
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:26,322
-Hey! -I want you to know
that we appreciate it.

1556
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:28,324
Let's have some music.
Let's have some music.

1557
01:20:28,357 --> 01:20:30,726
-Yeah, play... -Pete, put
some more yen in the jukebox.

1558
01:20:30,759 --> 01:20:32,695
Play "My Melancholy Geisha."

1559
01:20:32,728 --> 01:20:34,663
(laughter)

1560
01:20:34,697 --> 01:20:37,033
-(upbeat music playing)
-(excited chatter continues)

1561
01:20:41,905 --> 01:20:44,040
-Here we go, here we go!
-(rhythmic clapping)

1562
01:20:47,276 --> 01:20:48,577
Do-si-do!

1563
01:20:48,611 --> 01:20:50,413
Hey! Come on.

1564
01:20:50,446 --> 01:20:52,148
Yee-haw!

1565
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:53,582
Come on!

1566
01:20:53,616 --> 01:20:55,551
(whooping, laughter)

1567
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:01,925
(music continues inside)

1568
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:09,933
(excited chatter continues)

1569
01:21:21,978 --> 01:21:24,113
Swing it, baby! Yeah!

1570
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:33,056
Come on, McCaffrey.

1571
01:21:56,812 --> 01:21:59,215
-(music stops)
-(shrieks)

1572
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:02,051
So it's Red Fox McCaffrey
and Blue Boy Roth.

1573
01:22:02,085 --> 01:22:04,387
I should have known.

1574
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:06,122
(laughs)

1575
01:22:08,024 --> 01:22:11,060
Look, Captain,
I'm sure I can explain...

1576
01:22:11,094 --> 01:22:12,996
You can do your explaining
at a court-martial.

1577
01:22:12,996 --> 01:22:14,297
Well, in a very few words...

1578
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:16,632
Shut up, you barracks Confucius.

1579
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:18,467
-Uh...
-And you needn't even bother

1580
01:22:18,501 --> 01:22:20,269
to bring your gear along,
McCaffrey.

1581
01:22:20,303 --> 01:22:22,138
By the time you get
out of the brig,

1582
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:25,308
your uniform will be
out of style.

1583
01:22:25,341 --> 01:22:28,077
You make serious mistake.

1584
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:32,581
Mr. Red Fox capture
these Mata Hari spy girls.

1585
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:34,183
Mata Hari hookers.

1586
01:22:34,217 --> 01:22:36,752
Lock these men up,
and let's get some sleep.

1587
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:38,187
Report to headquarters.

1588
01:22:38,221 --> 01:22:40,189
Tell them to secure
the rest of the patrols

1589
01:22:40,223 --> 01:22:41,657
that are out on this operation.

1590
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:43,359
Yes, sir.

1591
01:22:43,392 --> 01:22:46,495
Diamond, Diamond,
this is Diamond Six. Over.

1592
01:22:46,529 --> 01:22:48,097
(over radio):
Get off the air.

1593
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:50,199
This is a priority message.

1594
01:22:50,233 --> 01:22:53,602
All leaves of the U.S.
Armed Services are canceled.

1595
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:57,373
All officers and men report
immediately to your base.

1596
01:22:57,406 --> 01:23:00,609
This is an alert
from the supreme command.

1597
01:23:00,643 --> 01:23:02,611
It looks as though these men
may be shipped out,

1598
01:23:02,645 --> 01:23:04,880
and that's a break for
the peace and quiet of Yokosuka.

1599
01:23:05,048 --> 01:23:07,616
Take your men with you, Gunny.
My report will follow them

1600
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:09,152
-back to the division.
-Aye-aye, sir.

1601
01:23:09,185 --> 01:23:10,719
-Okay, let's go!
-(clamoring)

1602
01:23:10,753 --> 01:23:12,221
Let's go!

1603
01:23:17,893 --> 01:23:21,064
(speaking Japanese)

1604
01:23:31,174 --> 01:23:32,808
All right, come on,
you guys, move!

1605
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,877
Let's go, on the double!
Let's go, come on!

1606
01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:36,245
Where's Waller?

1607
01:23:36,279 --> 01:23:37,880
I got him spotted
and he's close by.

1608
01:23:37,913 --> 01:23:41,084
Okay, let's go get him.

1609
01:23:41,084 --> 01:23:43,186
All very confusing!

1610
01:23:43,219 --> 01:23:45,688
Please come back again,
solider boy!

1611
01:23:58,901 --> 01:24:01,570
-Going over the hill, Waller?
-Don't let them stop us, Russ.

1612
01:24:01,604 --> 01:24:03,706
What do you mean, don't let him?
He's got the gang with him,

1613
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:05,574
-and there's only one of me.
-That would save you

1614
01:24:05,608 --> 01:24:07,176
from making your own decision,
wouldn't it?

1615
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:08,711
But you're gonna have to
make it by yourself.

1616
01:24:08,744 --> 01:24:11,180
I'm not a cop;
neither is any of those men.

1617
01:24:11,214 --> 01:24:13,015
The provost will
put out a tracer on you,

1618
01:24:13,116 --> 01:24:14,183
but still you might get away.

1619
01:24:14,217 --> 01:24:15,918
Come on, Russ, let's go.

1620
01:24:15,951 --> 01:24:17,953
Sure, who else but you would
want a bilge rat?

1621
01:24:17,986 --> 01:24:19,122
Take his decorations
in the morning,

1622
01:24:19,122 --> 01:24:20,756
then go over the side at night.

1623
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:22,391
Well, not me, not my platoon.

1624
01:24:22,425 --> 01:24:24,893
You've got him,
and he's right for you.

1625
01:24:24,927 --> 01:24:26,795
Well, that's all
I stopped by for, Waller,

1626
01:24:26,829 --> 01:24:29,732
just to give you a load
on how I feel about you.

1627
01:24:31,834 --> 01:24:34,537
Wait a minute, Sarge.

1628
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:35,871
Don't be an imbecile, Russ.

1629
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,706
Can't you see
what he's trying to do?

1630
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:40,143
He's trying to get you to
swallow the bait, hook and all.

1631
01:24:40,143 --> 01:24:41,144
You keep out of this.

1632
01:24:41,144 --> 01:24:43,146
Well, so long, Waller.

1633
01:24:43,179 --> 01:24:45,814
Remember what I told you,
and live with it.

1634
01:24:51,154 --> 01:24:54,157
-Hold it, Gunny!
-Russ!

1635
01:24:54,157 --> 01:24:56,159
Sayonara, tramp!

1636
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:58,261
*

1637
01:25:28,557 --> 01:25:30,493
*

1638
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:06,429
*

1639
01:26:36,959 --> 01:26:38,527
Okay, McCaffrey,
you and your men

1640
01:26:38,561 --> 01:26:40,696
make that patrol to the right
front like I briefed you.

1641
01:26:40,729 --> 01:26:42,398
Let's go!

1642
01:26:48,804 --> 01:26:52,575
If you guys can find
a better hole, get to it.

1643
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,415
Missed us again, Navy!

1644
01:27:02,651 --> 01:27:04,287
That's better, sailor boy!

1645
01:27:04,287 --> 01:27:06,389
Keep trying, you'll hit us yet,
you dummy!

1646
01:27:06,422 --> 01:27:08,391
Who you calling dummy?

1647
01:27:08,424 --> 01:27:10,058
Who was it that kept hollering,
"Let's go,"

1648
01:27:10,092 --> 01:27:12,561
when we got lost from Gunny
and the rest of the squad, huh?

1649
01:27:12,595 --> 01:27:15,798
What do you expect
on recon patrol, tourist maps?

1650
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:18,100
That joker on the guns
thinks he's ranging in

1651
01:27:18,133 --> 01:27:20,035
on a nest of red goons.

1652
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:22,571
Well, we're about a mile
inside the Chinese lines.

1653
01:27:22,605 --> 01:27:24,740
I suppose that's a big laugh,
huh, genius?

1654
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,314
Well, that's real tough.

1655
01:27:31,347 --> 01:27:33,782
Looks like we're still gonna
have to go before the mass

1656
01:27:33,816 --> 01:27:34,983
to face the C.O.

1657
01:27:35,017 --> 01:27:36,885
That's means five years
in the brig for me.

1658
01:27:36,919 --> 01:27:38,754
That's what a furlough
does to a man.

1659
01:27:38,787 --> 01:27:40,356
(laughs)

1660
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,067
Those guys will burn them out!

1661
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,002
Come on, let's go!

1662
01:28:13,188 --> 01:28:14,690
-Skip?
-Huh?

1663
01:28:14,723 --> 01:28:16,859
-See that hill?
-Yeah.

1664
01:28:19,495 --> 01:28:22,531
Take your men and circle around.

1665
01:28:22,565 --> 01:28:24,633
Pete and me
will go straight ahead.

1666
01:28:24,667 --> 01:28:27,169
We'll take Chatfield with us
so he won't get lost.

1667
01:28:27,202 --> 01:28:28,837
Right.

1668
01:28:52,194 --> 01:28:54,397
*

1669
01:29:12,415 --> 01:29:15,884
That'll drive the red buzzards
back into the hills.

1670
01:29:19,522 --> 01:29:22,591
Chatfield, stay undercover
of those woods.

1671
01:29:22,625 --> 01:29:24,493
Work your way down
to that valley of Koynam

1672
01:29:24,527 --> 01:29:25,861
or whatever they call it.

1673
01:29:25,894 --> 01:29:28,096
You spot any red goons,
get back here on the double.

1674
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:29,565
I've been wanting to look at it.

1675
01:29:29,598 --> 01:29:32,735
Be careful;
don't get your pants blown off.

1676
01:29:38,807 --> 01:29:40,208
Pete, cover him.

1677
01:29:40,242 --> 01:29:42,277
He'd walk right in
to a Chinese patrol

1678
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:43,912
and ask for a bowl of chop suey.

1679
01:29:43,946 --> 01:29:46,949
Don't forget this position.
We'll meet back here.

1680
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:15,811
*

1681
01:30:34,997 --> 01:30:37,132
(explosions continue
in distance)

1682
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:10,733
(man groaning)

1683
01:31:23,045 --> 01:31:24,346
Anything I can do?

1684
01:31:24,379 --> 01:31:25,548
(weakly):
No.

1685
01:31:25,581 --> 01:31:27,449
No, I've had it.

1686
01:31:27,550 --> 01:31:29,284
Where are the people
who lived here?

1687
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:32,621
Most got away, in the wood.

1688
01:31:32,655 --> 01:31:34,990
Are there many Chinese patrols?

1689
01:31:35,023 --> 01:31:37,225
Yes.

1690
01:31:37,259 --> 01:31:39,728
Yes. Watch out, Yank.

1691
01:31:48,436 --> 01:31:50,238
McCaffrey sent me to cover you.

1692
01:31:50,272 --> 01:31:52,240
He wouldn't trust me
with anything, would he?

1693
01:31:52,274 --> 01:31:54,209
Well, I got information for him.

1694
01:31:57,179 --> 01:31:59,582
(explosions continue
in distance)

1695
01:32:29,044 --> 01:32:30,946
*

1696
01:32:52,434 --> 01:32:53,902
(groans)

1697
01:32:55,738 --> 01:32:57,906
(gunfire continues)

1698
01:33:11,486 --> 01:33:14,923
(quietly): Pete, there must be
more of them around.

1699
01:33:14,957 --> 01:33:17,760
Our best chance of getting back
is to separate.

1700
01:33:17,793 --> 01:33:19,895
-Yeah, but how's your shoulder?
-It's okay.

1701
01:33:19,928 --> 01:33:22,898
Now, look, you go that way,

1702
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:26,268
and I'll go through the woods
this side.

1703
01:33:26,301 --> 01:33:28,336
Now get back to McCaffrey.

1704
01:33:28,370 --> 01:33:29,705
Okay.

1705
01:33:52,695 --> 01:33:54,797
(explosions continue
in distance)

1706
01:34:09,344 --> 01:34:11,947
My dear one? My dear one?

1707
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:13,248
Song Do.

1708
01:34:24,026 --> 01:34:25,393
Lee-san.

1709
01:34:25,427 --> 01:34:27,229
My friend.

1710
01:34:36,404 --> 01:34:37,973
Just as I thought.

1711
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:40,809
What'd softy boy do,
stop somewhere for tea?

1712
01:34:40,843 --> 01:34:42,377
No, you had him all wrong.

1713
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:44,747
This guy is tougher
than a 50-cent steak.

1714
01:34:44,747 --> 01:34:46,381
We were dropped by a red patrol.

1715
01:34:46,414 --> 01:34:48,751
When they busted his shoulder,
he still blazed away at them.

1716
01:34:48,784 --> 01:34:50,018
Yeah? Where's he at?

1717
01:34:50,052 --> 01:34:51,486
He made it into the woods.

1718
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:52,988
Well, he's on his own.

1719
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:55,423
I ain't gonna risk a detail
to save his hide.

1720
01:35:01,363 --> 01:35:06,668
Just to find you alive,
it's better than any medicine.

1721
01:35:06,769 --> 01:35:08,904
I've got to get back
to my squad now.

1722
01:35:08,937 --> 01:35:10,438
You stay hidden here.

1723
01:35:10,472 --> 01:35:13,341
Our forces are moving up;
you'll be safe then.

1724
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:14,777
You stay here, too.

1725
01:35:14,777 --> 01:35:17,045
The wound is bad. You must rest.

1726
01:35:17,079 --> 01:35:20,582
No, there's no time for that.

1727
01:35:20,615 --> 01:35:22,017
(sighs)

1728
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:24,386
(woman shouting in Japanese)

1729
01:35:27,055 --> 01:35:28,356
The Chinese soldiers come.

1730
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:30,258
All right,
get your people out of here.

1731
01:35:30,292 --> 01:35:32,260
Come on, get them out of here.
You'll all be shot for this.

1732
01:35:32,294 --> 01:35:33,896
-And what happens to you?
-I'll just give them

1733
01:35:33,929 --> 01:35:36,064
the McCaffrey treatment.

1734
01:35:40,668 --> 01:35:42,637
Song Do, go!

1735
01:35:42,670 --> 01:35:44,006
Go, Song Do!

1736
01:35:46,909 --> 01:35:49,111
My love, remember,

1737
01:35:49,144 --> 01:35:51,880
our lives will be
joined together

1738
01:35:51,914 --> 01:35:54,416
by what these fools call death.

1739
01:35:57,252 --> 01:35:59,187
(gunfire)

1740
01:36:05,527 --> 01:36:08,196
McCaffrey!

1741
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:15,670
So you found yourself a chick
out here and got yourself

1742
01:36:15,703 --> 01:36:19,007
all shot up so you can go back
and set up light housekeeping.

1743
01:36:19,041 --> 01:36:20,642
I'm not going back anywhere.

1744
01:36:20,675 --> 01:36:21,844
Shut up, punk!

1745
01:36:21,877 --> 01:36:23,311
When our guys come through here,

1746
01:36:23,345 --> 01:36:24,947
you get yourself back
to an aide station

1747
01:36:24,980 --> 01:36:26,949
and take all these people
out with you!

1748
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:31,353
All right, Pete,
knock that red gook off.

1749
01:36:31,386 --> 01:36:33,321
Go ahead!

1750
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:37,692
Hold it!

1751
01:36:37,725 --> 01:36:39,294
We'll take him back with us.

1752
01:36:39,327 --> 01:36:42,130
Maybe he'll do some talking.

1753
01:36:42,164 --> 01:36:43,866
All right, all you people, out!

1754
01:36:43,899 --> 01:36:46,034
Come on, out!

1755
01:37:20,368 --> 01:37:22,504
(explosions continue
in distance)

1756
01:37:39,087 --> 01:37:41,156
What the hell
are you doing here?

1757
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:43,825
Don't hand me any more orders,
you broken-down private.

1758
01:37:43,926 --> 01:37:46,428
The only one I'll take
from you is, "Let's go."

1759
01:37:58,941 --> 01:38:01,043
*

1760
01:38:20,295 --> 01:38:22,397
(quietly):
Psst, hey, Mac.

1761
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,302
Look what I found.

1762
01:38:28,971 --> 01:38:32,707
All right, Pete, ask him again
where the lookout post is,

1763
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:35,110
how many men they got,
and where the charges are.

1764
01:38:35,143 --> 01:38:37,279
(speaking Chinese)

1765
01:38:40,848 --> 01:38:42,417
(speaking Chinese)

1766
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:51,994
He says the whole valley over
there's loaded with explosives.

1767
01:38:51,994 --> 01:38:54,229
The control men are
in a bunker up there

1768
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:56,398
on the other side that hill.

1769
01:38:56,431 --> 01:39:00,368
And our guys
are walking right into it.

1770
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:07,742
Where you going, Chatfield?!

1771
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:09,744
They can't walk into it.

1772
01:39:09,777 --> 01:39:11,479
You stay here. This is my job.

1773
01:39:11,513 --> 01:39:13,681
All right, Pete,
get him out of here.

1774
01:39:13,715 --> 01:39:16,218
Cover him, you guys!

1775
01:39:41,043 --> 01:39:44,046
*

1776
01:40:12,907 --> 01:40:15,043
(speaking Chinese)

1777
01:40:40,968 --> 01:40:43,105
*

1778
01:40:54,982 --> 01:40:56,784
(groans)

1779
01:41:08,396 --> 01:41:10,332
Mac?

1780
01:41:16,671 --> 01:41:18,206
Chatfield?

1781
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:20,208
Yeah, Mac?

1782
01:41:20,242 --> 01:41:23,245
You're okay.

1783
01:41:26,148 --> 01:41:27,749
Skip.

1784
01:41:27,782 --> 01:41:30,818
Yeah, old buddy?

1785
01:41:30,852 --> 01:41:32,220
I...

1786
01:41:32,254 --> 01:41:34,256
(exhales)

1787
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:57,279
(sniffles)

1788
01:41:59,181 --> 01:42:01,816
Well, come on, can't you hear
what he's saying?

1789
01:42:03,718 --> 01:42:06,421
He ain't saying nothing;
he's dead.

1790
01:42:06,454 --> 01:42:08,089
Not to me he isn't.

1791
01:42:08,190 --> 01:42:11,459
I'll always hear him yelling,
"Marines, let's go."

1792
01:42:19,567 --> 01:42:21,503
*

1793
01:42:47,895 --> 01:42:49,831
*

1794
01:43:16,258 --> 01:43:17,525
* Hup, two, three

1795
01:43:17,559 --> 01:43:19,361
* Hear him call, "Let's go"

1796
01:43:19,394 --> 01:43:21,429
* Come on, Marines, let's go

1797
01:43:21,463 --> 01:43:23,398
* Hit the deck, leatherneck

1798
01:43:23,431 --> 01:43:25,400
* Fall in line, double time

1799
01:43:25,433 --> 01:43:27,335
* Hear him call, "Let's go"

1800
01:43:27,369 --> 01:43:29,671
* Come on, Marines, let's go

1801
01:43:29,704 --> 01:43:33,875
* We're going to make some
history along the battle line *

1802
01:43:33,908 --> 01:43:35,943
* Hup, two, three, four

1803
01:43:35,977 --> 01:43:37,679
* Hup, two, three, go!

1804
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:41,683
* We're going to make some
history along the battle line *

1805
01:43:41,716 --> 01:43:43,851
* We're going to make
some history *

1806
01:43:43,885 --> 01:43:45,687
* Along the battle line

1807
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:48,756
* We're going to make some
history along the battle line. *
