Thank you for attending the
Great Imperial Theater today.

Thank you so
much for your patronage!

Great work, everyone!

You, too!

Thanks for making the announcement.

23

Sure.

24

Wasn't that an amazing
round of applause, Leni?

00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:27,430
I thought I was going to pass out!

26
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,599
Yes, the crowd was
especially enthusiastic today.

27
00:05:29,808 --> 00:05:31,726
We must thank our audience.

28
00:05:31,935 --> 00:05:33,854
I reckon we should, Miss Maria!

29

the audience were one!

00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:38,692

you all did rather well.

Is something the matter?

33
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:47,367
It's so rare for you to
compliment others, Miss Sumire.

34
00:05:47,576 --> 00:05:49,327
You got that right!

35
00:05:49,536 --> 00:05:52,747
Honestly, though,
this is a good kind of tired!

36
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:55,709
Orihime, you worked hard all this year.

37
00:05:55,917 --> 00:06:00,088
That's right, but you
worked hardest of all, Miss Karma.

38
00:06:00,297 --> 00:06:03,216
Oh, but I don't recall
Miss Karma working all that hard...

one around here who hasn't--

The manager?

106
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:40,994
I see. So, the Elders
Institute has finally decided...

107
00:10:41,202 --> 00:10:44,247
...to set up a Fighting
Troupe even in America.

108
00:10:44,455 --> 00:10:46,749
Yes, Sir. Following in the
footsteps of Tokyo and Paris,

109
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,295
the third City Defense Plan will
be the New York Fighting Troupe.

110
00:10:50,503 --> 00:10:54,340
So, why did you come
all the way out to Tokyo?

111
00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:57,886
The Imperial Capital has successfully
fought off two great demon invasions,

112
00:10:58,094 --> 00:11:00,263
and Paris has recently repelled the Parishii.

113
00:11:00,471 --> 00:11:03,683
I concluded that to learn from these
successes, it would be more efficient...

114
00:11:03,892 --> 00:11:06,561
...to work in the field with them
rather than study them from afar.

115
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,855
Efficient, eh?

116
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:13,276
As of today, I've been assigned to the
Imperial Fighting Troupe, Flower Division.

117
00:11:13,484 --> 00:11:17,864
Lachette Altair, reporting for duty.
I look forward to serving under you.

118
00:11:18,865 --> 00:11:24,245
So, I'm guessing you already got the
Elders lnstitute's permission for this, eh?

119
00:11:24,454 --> 00:11:29,918
Knowing you, you probably brought
your own Eisenkleid to Japan, didn't you?

120
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:32,921
Where is it? We'll have to send
someone to go pick it up right away.

121
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:37,008
There's no worry there, Sir.
I already brought it with me on the truck.

122
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:43,014
As always, it seems you've
already got this all worked out.

123
00:11:43,223 --> 00:11:46,684
I simply chose the most
efficient course of action.

124
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:57,862
Well, well. What to do, what to do...?

125
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:02,033
She was against the breakup
of Star Division to the very end.

126
00:12:02,242 --> 00:12:04,535
More than anyone else,
she took pride in her role...

127
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:07,622
...as a guardian of the
people against the darkness.

128
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:10,708
But no matter how exceptional
their skill and abilities were,

129
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:14,379
as a group, they were just too fragile.

130
00:12:14,587 --> 00:12:16,839
We'll have to see if Lachette
has come to realize the real reason...

131
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:19,801
...why Star Division was disbanded.

132
00:12:20,802 --> 00:12:23,888
Our imperial capital of Tokyo is
enjoying great prosperity at the moment.

133
00:12:24,097 --> 00:12:26,015
What are you worried about?

134
00:12:26,224 --> 00:12:30,728
Have we not neglected our defenses
in the rush to improve our infrastructure?

135
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:33,147
You're jumping at shadows.

136
00:12:33,356 --> 00:12:36,818
What do you think we've
come here to address, then?

137
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:41,364
The capital is open in all directions,
linked to the country via her waterways.

138
00:12:41,572 --> 00:12:45,493
This geographic advantage has brought
about the prosperity we enjoy today.

139
00:12:45,702 --> 00:12:48,371
But could we also be taking in
diseased elements in the process?

140
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:49,998
Are you talking about America?

141
00:12:50,206 --> 00:12:51,874
Even if that were the case,

142
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:56,170
the capital can rely on the
Imperial Fighting Troupe for her defense.

143
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:59,215
Is it wise to be completely
dependent on those young girls?

144
00:12:59,424 --> 00:13:03,803
There are, no doubt, issues we
must address, but they are trivial.

145
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:06,514
We need look no further
than our own capital and Paris...

146
00:13:06,723 --> 00:13:09,142
...to see that the Fighting Troupe
program is a success.

147
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,561
Our nation needs a capital city,

148
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:15,940
and to be prosperous, a city needs to
be open to the free movement of people.

149
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:20,987
It is unavoidable for the bright lights
of prosperity to give rise to dark shadows.

150
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:25,074
In a sense, we must accept
this and learn to live with it.

151
00:13:25,283 --> 00:13:27,744
I trust you all understand this.

152
00:13:27,952 --> 00:13:32,123
What is the government's
position on this issue, Mr. Tanuma?

153
00:13:32,332 --> 00:13:37,587
Well, for the city to further
develop as a powerful occult center,

154
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:41,257
our existing spiritual quarantine measures
will likely offer inadequate protection.

155
00:13:41,466 --> 00:13:48,681
At this time, then, nothing can replace
the Fighting Troupe's Flower Division.

156
00:13:49,349 --> 00:13:52,393
However, in the spirit of being
constantly mindful of our surroundings,

157
00:13:52,602 --> 00:13:55,563
I believe we should not shy
away from introducing new blood...

158
00:13:55,772 --> 00:13:59,192
...to meet new challenges as the need arises.

159
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,070
I venture to say that the darkness
will come upon us yet again.

160
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:05,490
But if this capital should
succumb to the darkness,

161
00:14:05,698 --> 00:14:08,076
it would mean that
the entire nation would fall.

162
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:10,370
That must never happen!

163
00:14:11,412 --> 00:14:14,457
So, a cutie from America, huh?

164
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,376
There you are, Miss Sakura.

165
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:18,044
Thank you.

166
00:14:18,252 --> 00:14:23,007
So tell us, Miss Sakura,
was this person really that beautiful?

167
00:14:23,216 --> 00:14:25,843
She's talking to Mr. Yoneda right now,

168
00:14:26,052 --> 00:14:27,887
but she'll probably
pass through here afterwards.

169
00:14:28,096 --> 00:14:31,808
True, but we need to
hear your first impression of her.

170
00:14:32,016 --> 00:14:33,518
Why's that?

171
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:38,439
One set of eyes usually ain't enough
to get a true understanding of something.

172
00:14:38,648 --> 00:14:40,233
Now, I don't know
how good looking she is,

173
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:44,070
but we all gotta get a look at
her to get to the heart of the matter.

174
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:45,780
Is that so?

175
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:50,827
Here comes the heart of the matter now!

176
00:14:51,494 --> 00:14:54,914
Talk about awkward!
I bet she heard every word we said!

177
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:57,875
Like they say,
"curiosity killed the cat."

178
00:14:58,084 --> 00:14:58,626
What's that?

179
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:00,795
A Western saying.

180
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:03,381
Already trying to act like
an American, Miss Sakura?

181
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:04,715
Of course not!

182
00:15:04,924 --> 00:15:06,426
Miss Sakura!

183
00:15:20,857 --> 00:15:23,401
Wow, she's a real beauty, all right!

184
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:24,944
See?

185
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:12,241
This country is not very attractive.

186
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,161
I know what you mean, Sir.

187
00:16:17,497 --> 00:16:20,458
This country is in need of a true king.

188
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:25,046
What's rational is that the
world be under a single entity.

189
00:16:25,254 --> 00:16:27,465
That, we have to teach them.

190
00:16:27,673 --> 00:16:31,135
I knew you were going to say that, Sir.

191
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:40,102
Beautiful.

192
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:29,110
Kouma, fallen demons,
have appeared in Zaimoku-Cho.

193
00:17:29,318 --> 00:17:31,737
We have confirmation of thirteen so far.

194
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:36,075
A fire has broken out, but Moon
Division is at work putting it out.

195
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:37,868
Fires can spread quickly this time of year,

196
00:17:38,077 --> 00:17:40,913
so be mindful of the surrounding
houses during combat.

197
00:17:41,122 --> 00:17:41,872
Yes, Sir!

198
00:17:42,081 --> 00:17:45,334
Right! Imperial Fighting Troupe,
Flower Division, dispatch at once!

199
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:46,877
--Yes, Sir!
--Yes, Sir!

200
00:17:50,673 --> 00:17:53,801
Deputy Commander, we've completed
calculating the path to the scene.

201
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,595
Put it up on the screen.

202
00:17:56,262 --> 00:17:57,555
The Gourai-Go's preparations?

203
00:17:57,763 --> 00:17:59,390
Ready in sixty seconds.

204
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,227
Flower Division members have
begun boarding their Koubu-Kai's.

205
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:11,652
--Ignition complete.
--Maria Tachibana, ready for dispatch.

206
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:12,778
Kohran here, I'm A-OK.

207
00:18:12,987 --> 00:18:15,489
Karma Kirishima, ready to go!

208
00:18:22,538 --> 00:18:24,248
Sakura, ignition complete!

209
00:18:24,457 --> 00:18:25,916
Koubu-Kai units,
ignition complete!

210
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,877
All right, begin loading!

211
00:18:49,106 --> 00:18:50,608
Now loading.

212
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:30,981
Moving engine into position.

213
00:19:38,322 --> 00:19:39,824
Rotation complete!

214
00:20:38,257 --> 00:20:39,759
Descent complete.

215
00:21:05,826 --> 00:21:08,621
Moving Gourai-Go
into launch position.

216
00:21:52,373 --> 00:21:53,582
"Emergency Vehicle"

217
00:21:59,672 --> 00:22:01,340
Asakusa Station cleared!

218
00:23:02,151 --> 00:23:03,235
Stay sharp!

219
00:23:03,444 --> 00:23:04,778
-Yes' Ma.

220
00:23:47,404 --> 00:23:48,739
Leni!

221
00:24:10,511 --> 00:24:11,929
Lachette!

222
00:24:24,984 --> 00:24:29,947
Stop fighting on your own!
We fight as a team!

223
00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:53,053
What was that?

224
00:24:53,262 --> 00:24:55,222
--What was that just now?
--Was it one of ours?

225
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:58,475
--What the hell's going on?
--That's some impressive hardware!

226
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:23,959
Who in the world could that have been?

227
00:25:24,168 --> 00:25:27,421
How the hell are
we supposed to find out?

228
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:33,052
We were all quite startled.

229
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,846
A humanoid steamer
of unknown origin, you say?

230
00:25:36,055 --> 00:25:37,389
Yes, Sir.

231
00:25:38,098 --> 00:25:40,517
Well, it looks like it's started.

232
00:25:40,726 --> 00:25:42,436
How do you mean, Sir?

233
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:47,900
You know, in a capitalist nation,
"freedom" means the freedom to compete.

234
00:25:48,108 --> 00:25:49,276
Sir?

235
00:25:49,485 --> 00:25:51,862
I just hope this won't get complicated.

236
00:25:52,071 --> 00:25:56,075
Also, Sir, about the
new member of the division...

237
00:25:56,283 --> 00:25:59,119
What about Lachette?

238
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:07,503
Sounds like it's
gonna get complicated.

239
00:26:12,257 --> 00:26:14,176
Who the hell is this?

240
00:26:14,384 --> 00:26:18,388
Lachette Altair, our old captain
from back when we were in Star Division.

241
00:26:18,597 --> 00:26:20,766
What, you know this person?

242
00:26:20,974 --> 00:26:22,768
But what's she doing here?

243
00:26:22,976 --> 00:26:24,645
I have no idea.

244
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:28,315
Lachette!

245
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:31,902
Hi, Orihime. It's been a while.

246
00:26:32,111 --> 00:26:32,861
Geez!

247
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,738
Have you met?

248
00:26:37,282 --> 00:26:39,284
Lachette, it's been so long!

249
00:26:39,493 --> 00:26:42,663
It sure has, Orihime.
You're looking well.

250
00:26:42,871 --> 00:26:46,083
And... you, too, Leni.

251
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,210
Why are you here?

252
00:26:48,877 --> 00:26:50,212
Leni!

253
00:27:02,224 --> 00:27:04,309
Leni, wait for me!

254
00:27:06,937 --> 00:27:10,399
It looks like Leni is
still uncomfortable around you.

255
00:27:10,607 --> 00:27:13,694
This will be a problem since we're all
Flower Division members now.

256
00:27:13,902 --> 00:27:15,779
Is that so?

257
00:27:16,446 --> 00:27:20,951
I'm Lachette Altair.
I hope we'll work well together.

258
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,375
And so, it has been decided that
this unit will be leased to the Army...

259
00:27:28,584 --> 00:27:32,129
...along with technical
advisors from Douglas-Stewart.

260
00:27:32,796 --> 00:27:35,132
It may be that we
are still in the trial stages,

261
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,427
but I'm certain they will be officially
adopted into service within a year.

262
00:27:38,635 --> 00:27:43,015
Once that happens, there will
be no need for Flower Division,

263
00:27:43,223 --> 00:27:47,227
and we'll no longer have to expose
young girls to unnecessary dangers.

264
00:27:47,436 --> 00:27:48,645
Will we, Count Hanakouji?

265
00:27:48,854 --> 00:27:54,109
Mr. Tanuma, if you have something
to say, stop beating around the bush.

266
00:27:54,318 --> 00:27:56,111
M)' apologies.

267
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,658
I merely wished to point out the
winds of change to my esteemed elder.

268
00:28:01,867 --> 00:28:05,746
What is new will
eventually become obsolete.

269
00:28:05,954 --> 00:28:09,249
While this demonstration was
typically American in its recklessness,

270
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,418
I believe you now know just how capable...

271
00:28:11,627 --> 00:28:15,589
...the unmanned, low-cost
humanoid steamer "Japhkiel" is.

272
00:28:15,797 --> 00:28:19,801
Such utter grandstanding... You knew
of this beforehand, didn't you?

273
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,386
But of course.

274
00:28:21,595 --> 00:28:25,307
Only a fool would play poker while
showing his hand for all to see.

275
00:28:25,515 --> 00:28:28,560
You're saying that you see governance
and gambling as the same thing?

276
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:33,565
My dear Count, it is often
said that life is one big gamble.

277
00:28:33,774 --> 00:28:39,655
For a government, are not
deeds more important than words?

278
00:29:11,436 --> 00:29:14,731
Leni certainly has changed...

279
00:29:50,183 --> 00:29:52,769
W-What in the world?

280
00:30:57,292 --> 00:30:59,169
A defective product.

281
00:30:59,378 --> 00:31:00,837
W-Wait a moment!

282
00:31:01,046 --> 00:31:05,050
This won't do!
If anyone found out what's in--

283
00:31:06,843 --> 00:31:09,221
Refrain from making
such careless statements.

284
00:31:09,429 --> 00:31:14,226
Or else our amicable relationship
will have to be terminated right here.

285
00:31:14,434 --> 00:31:16,520
Is that your wish?

286
00:31:18,522 --> 00:31:20,982
We aren't equals.

287
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:25,404
You'd do well to remember that.

288
00:31:31,993 --> 00:31:35,622
"January 1, Taisho 16 (1926 A.D.)"

289
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:46,925
"Happy New Year From
Namamise Shopping Arcade!"

290
00:31:52,472 --> 00:31:55,267
"Kaminarimon"

291
00:31:59,271 --> 00:32:01,898
Go faster, Miss Karma!
Go faster, faster!

292
00:32:02,107 --> 00:32:04,734
Leave it to me! Here we go!

293
00:32:04,818 --> 00:32:06,445
" Ningyo-yaki"

294
00:32:06,653 --> 00:32:08,280
"Kaminari-okoshi"

295
00:32:08,488 --> 00:32:10,365
"Senbei"

296
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,458
C'mon, Big Sister Kasumi,
let's look around in the stores here.

297
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:23,086
Not yet, Iris. We'll go
after we pray at the shrine.

298
00:32:23,295 --> 00:32:25,380
But that's boring!

299
00:32:31,386 --> 00:32:34,806
The texture is reminiscent of
the Italian dish, gnocchi.

300
00:32:35,015 --> 00:32:37,893
Gnocchi? What a strange name.

301
00:32:38,101 --> 00:32:42,606
What do you mean? It's Japanese
food names that are strange.

302
00:32:42,814 --> 00:32:49,779
<i>Yuba, ganmodoki, tokoroten,
kiritanpo, kinchaku...</i>

303
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:55,285
And these are miso-tarashi rice balls,
but where's the miso sauce?

304
00:32:55,494 --> 00:32:58,163
It's mi-tarashi, Miss
Orihime, not miso-tarashi.

305
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:04,044
And how in the world are
you supposed to eat the last one?

306
00:33:11,468 --> 00:33:15,138
Okay! And now we'll add another two!

307
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:18,183
Here's one! And here's the other!

308
00:33:25,106 --> 00:33:26,900
"Fortunes"

309
00:33:27,108 --> 00:33:28,902
"#100: Colossal Misfortune"

310
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,863
"Your wishes will not be granted.
Your health may suffer."

311
00:33:32,072 --> 00:33:34,991
"Lost items will not return.
Romances and relationships will sour."

312
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,743
What's this supposed to mean?!

313
00:33:36,952 --> 00:33:39,746
What did I do to deserve
this kind of abuse?!

314
00:33:39,955 --> 00:33:41,748
Don't let it bother you, Kohran.

315
00:33:41,957 --> 00:33:45,502
If it's that bad, it just
means it can't get any worse.

316
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,421
What about you?

317
00:33:48,797 --> 00:33:51,800
The prediction for your luck is only so-so.
There's nothing special here...

318
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:55,303
You sure seem awfully happy, though...

319
00:33:55,512 --> 00:33:57,222
Ah-ha! This must be it!

320
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,558
"The one you await will soon return."

321
00:33:59,766 --> 00:34:02,561
"The one you await," huh?
I wonder who that could be?

322
00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:04,271
I have no idea!

323
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:08,066
Oh, really? I was thinking
it might just be Mr. 00--

324
00:34:08,275 --> 00:34:12,571
Come on, now! We should be
concentrating on our new play.

325
00:34:12,779 --> 00:34:15,740
I suppose so, but I'm stuck
with a bit part in this new one.

326
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,450
You are?

327
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:22,247
Yeah. It's too bad, 'cause I've
always liked Izumi Kyouka's works.

328
00:34:22,455 --> 00:34:25,417
Is it true that Miss Lachette nabbed
the lead role her first time out?

329
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:28,086
Yes, won't this be exciting to see?

330
00:34:28,295 --> 00:34:31,548
Okay, everyone!
Let's do the next scene now!

331
00:34:31,756 --> 00:34:34,217
Now remember, this is
the Dragon King's Palace.

332
00:34:34,426 --> 00:34:37,262
The prince has bought the girl he
loves with a gift of treasure to her father,

333
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:41,016
and with the exchange agreed to,
he's waiting for the girl to arrive.

334
00:34:41,224 --> 00:34:42,309
Souzu.

335
00:34:42,517 --> 00:34:44,978
Yes, what is it, Young Master?

336
00:34:45,186 --> 00:34:50,734
I wonder if they are satisfied with the
treasure I sent in exchange for their daughter.

337
00:34:50,942 --> 00:34:51,943
Yes, Master.

338
00:34:52,152 --> 00:34:53,987
They would not have
sent out their daughter...

339
00:34:54,195 --> 00:34:57,574
...had they not been
happy with the gift you offered.

340
00:34:57,782 --> 00:35:00,410
Truly, avarice runs deep in all humans.

341
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:05,915
But the maiden that won the heart of
our young master will enjoy happiness!

342
00:35:06,124 --> 00:35:09,794
If only she would arrive soon!

343
00:35:10,795 --> 00:35:13,673
There! That bright
beacon of light is she!

344
00:35:13,882 --> 00:35:15,925
It would appear that she has arrived.

345
00:35:17,093 --> 00:35:18,011
Are you all right, Lachette?!

346
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:19,721
Not a problem!

347
00:35:22,182 --> 00:35:24,517
--What do you think you're doing?
--What's the big idea?!

348
00:35:24,726 --> 00:35:26,019
--C'mon, fix me up!
--Same here!

349
00:35:26,227 --> 00:35:28,396
--Just a little more!
--Miss Sakura, don't leave my flank!

350
00:35:28,605 --> 00:35:28,855
Right!

351
00:35:29,064 --> 00:35:32,025
--Do we leave this to the Japhkiels?
--Oh, no! They're focusing on Miss Leni!

352
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:33,568
--Leni! --I'll go help!
--They're certainly agile!

353
00:35:33,777 --> 00:35:35,111
Too late!

354
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,571
Leni!

355
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,782
To hell with this!

356
00:35:39,908 --> 00:35:41,409
--Orihime!
--Orihime!

357
00:35:42,952 --> 00:35:46,790
Two Flower Division Koubu-Kai's suffered
major damage in the last engagement.

358
00:35:46,998 --> 00:35:50,001
One division member was injured.

359
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,544
The damaged Koubu-Kai units...

360
00:35:51,753 --> 00:35:55,131
...have been transported to the Kanzaki
Heavy Industries factory for repairs.

361
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,092
For the duration of the repairs,
we plan to make do...

362
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,096
...with two Eisenkleids which
had previously been mothballed.

363
00:36:03,765 --> 00:36:08,687
Next, regarding the status of the Imperial
Army 13th Special Mechanized Squad.

364
00:36:08,895 --> 00:36:11,564
Five Japhkiels were
dispatched and suffered no damage.

365
00:36:11,773 --> 00:36:16,236
Their Kouma kill score appears to be
rather larger than that of Flower Division.

366
00:36:16,444 --> 00:36:18,905
It would seem that
the times have changed.

367
00:36:19,114 --> 00:36:22,951
If I may, I would like
to make a request now.

368
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:26,413
It's a simple matter, really.

369
00:36:26,621 --> 00:36:28,790
Command of a Japhkiel squad?!

370
00:36:28,998 --> 00:36:31,876
Why should we have
to do something like that?!

371
00:36:32,085 --> 00:36:36,673
In the military, you gotta faithfully
follow any order coming from above.

372
00:36:36,881 --> 00:36:40,802
There is far too much about this Japhkiel
deployment that is suspicious.

373
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:45,265
I'm told that their deployment
is classified top secret.

374
00:36:45,473 --> 00:36:47,392
Are we to be window dressing?

375
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,853
Military officers will be
doing the actual commanding!

376
00:36:50,061 --> 00:36:51,730
That ain't window dressing!

377
00:36:51,938 --> 00:36:55,900
But this is like a de facto
breakup of Flower Division!

378
00:36:56,109 --> 00:36:58,695
Just because we've been relieved
of our Kouma intercept duties...

379
00:36:58,903 --> 00:37:01,865
...doesn't mean Flower Division
is being disbanded.

380
00:37:02,866 --> 00:37:04,993
I'll go to the Army.

381
00:37:05,201 --> 00:37:07,787
Who do you think you are?!

382
00:37:07,996 --> 00:37:10,039
Listening to Lt. General Yoneda
discuss the matter,

383
00:37:10,248 --> 00:37:13,710
it seemed to me that I would
be the most appropriate candidate.

384
00:37:14,669 --> 00:37:17,172
Well, I suppose Lachette would--

385
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,256
I'm going to go!

386
00:37:18,465 --> 00:37:19,424
I'm going to go!

387
00:37:19,632 --> 00:37:20,967
I'm going to go!

388
00:37:21,176 --> 00:37:22,719
All right, all right!

389
00:37:22,927 --> 00:37:27,056
If you want to go so badly,
you can go to the Army.

390
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:35,774
Oh, brother... How are we going to be able
to put together a production in this state?

391
00:37:51,122 --> 00:37:52,499
What the--

392
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:56,127
Commander Yoneda's gone missing?!

393
00:37:56,336 --> 00:37:58,087
Commander Yoneda's gone missing?!

394
00:37:58,296 --> 00:38:00,757
Commander Yoneda's gone missing?!

395
00:38:00,965 --> 00:38:05,053
Moon Division and Dream Division
are currently doing all they can to find him.

396
00:38:05,261 --> 00:38:08,556
Actually, Lt. General Yoneda isn't
the only one who has disappeared.

397
00:38:08,765 --> 00:38:10,600
Count Hanakouji is missing, as well.

398
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:14,312
I have one other piece of bad news.

399
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:19,275
The operation of the Imperial Operetta
Troupe has been indefinitely suspended.

400
00:38:20,235 --> 00:38:22,821
As of today, we are all to relocate
to the Flower Mansion Branch.

401
00:38:23,029 --> 00:38:25,615
The Imperial Theater complex is
to be placed under Army jurisdiction.

402
00:38:25,824 --> 00:38:26,616
No!

403
00:38:26,825 --> 00:38:28,493
I don't believe it...!

404
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:31,162
Kouma reported at Fukagawa!

405
00:38:31,371 --> 00:38:34,958
Japhkiel squad has requested
dispatch of their commanding officer.

406
00:38:36,292 --> 00:38:38,253
I'll go now.

407
00:38:38,461 --> 00:38:39,879
Orihime...

408
00:38:40,088 --> 00:38:44,968
Make me proud as a former
member of Star Division, Orihime.

409
00:38:45,176 --> 00:38:47,053
This has nothing to do with Star Division.

410
00:38:47,262 --> 00:38:50,431
I am a member of Flower Division now.

411
00:38:55,478 --> 00:38:57,939
Pack your belongings, everyone.

412
00:38:58,147 --> 00:39:00,859
We leave for the
Flower Mansion in one hour.

413
00:39:02,819 --> 00:39:04,487
Miss Orihime...

414
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,241
Miss Orihime, disembark
from the Gourai-Go at Nihonbashi,

415
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:11,536
and head to Fukagawa
from there over land.

416
00:39:11,744 --> 00:39:13,037
<i>Roger.</i>

417
00:39:13,246 --> 00:39:14,789
Orihime...

418
00:39:14,998 --> 00:39:19,043
I'm proud to be a
member of Flower Division.

419
00:39:19,252 --> 00:39:24,674
That's why I don't want to let
Lachette outdo me as she is now.

420
00:39:45,361 --> 00:39:49,782
It's amazing how these
things move on their own.

421
00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:01,961
Where are the Kouma?

422
00:40:30,698 --> 00:40:32,200
There!

423
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,663
There!

424
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:39,374
There!

425
00:40:49,926 --> 00:40:51,260
There!

426
00:40:53,096 --> 00:40:56,432
I wonder if things are
working out for Miss Orihime...

427
00:40:56,641 --> 00:41:02,063
I'm sorry, but all of my
information sources have dried up.

428
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:04,649
I see.

429
00:41:04,857 --> 00:41:08,695
I wonder if we'll
never pilot our Koubu's again...

430
00:41:08,903 --> 00:41:13,783
If it means that peace in Tokyo is secure,
it's a small enough price to pay.

431
00:41:14,826 --> 00:41:19,288
But if... If Flower Division
were to be disbanded...

432
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:44,105
All the Japhkiels on this
production line are empty shells...

433
00:41:44,313 --> 00:41:46,274
Where are their interiors?

434
00:42:06,961 --> 00:42:11,340
This... What's inside the Japhkiels is...

435
00:42:12,008 --> 00:42:16,387
Kouma... What have they done?!

436
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,314
It's a pleasure to meet you, Maria.

437
00:42:26,522 --> 00:42:29,442
How flattering. Are you one of my fans?

438
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,361
My name is Patrick.

439
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:38,159
As you are about to die, I felt I should
reveal my real name to you.

440
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:40,620
<i>You've learned too much'.!</i>

441
00:42:45,958 --> 00:42:50,630
I hate to disappoint you,
but bullets have no effect on me.

442
00:43:06,521 --> 00:43:08,314
Miss Maria did what?!

443
00:43:08,523 --> 00:43:12,068
I hear she left a note saying she was
going to dig around inside Douglas-Stewart.

444
00:43:12,276 --> 00:43:14,278
They say no one's heard from her since.

445
00:43:14,487 --> 00:43:15,446
Let's go look for her!

446
00:43:15,655 --> 00:43:18,157
We mustn't act recklessly.

447
00:43:18,366 --> 00:43:20,618
But we've gotta--

448
00:43:20,827 --> 00:43:25,373
Don't worry about Miss Maria.
She's our captain, after all.

449
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:30,294
Then I should just
sit here and do nothing?!

450
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,422
I never got a
chance to give this to her.

451
00:43:33,631 --> 00:43:37,093
I made this bullet
filled with spirit power.

452
00:43:38,052 --> 00:43:40,847
I only managed to get
one round to Mr. Kayama.

453
00:43:41,055 --> 00:43:45,852
If you don't do what you can while
you can, you'll only regret it later.

454
00:43:48,312 --> 00:43:50,565
What can we do, I ask you?!

455
00:43:50,773 --> 00:43:52,775
The Shogei-Maru has
been sealed, and Wind Division...

456
00:43:52,984 --> 00:43:56,654
...and the Deputy Commander
are under house arrest at the theater!

457
00:43:56,863 --> 00:43:59,866
What can we possibly do?!

458
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:06,706
Why not?

459
00:44:07,373 --> 00:44:09,876
Let's do what we can.

460
00:44:10,543 --> 00:44:13,462
I don't want to live with regrets.

461
00:44:14,088 --> 00:44:15,882
Why don't we all do this together?

462
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:17,091
Yes!

463
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:17,884
Let's do it!

464
00:44:18,092 --> 00:44:18,885
Let's go for it!

465
00:44:19,093 --> 00:44:19,719
You're on!

466
00:44:19,927 --> 00:44:21,179
I suppose we must.

467
00:44:21,387 --> 00:44:22,930
Yes, let's!

468
00:44:23,139 --> 00:44:24,599
Mr. Yokihiko from Rose Division!

469
00:44:24,807 --> 00:44:27,268
This entire affair seems to have
to do with a branch of the Army...

470
00:44:27,476 --> 00:44:31,355
...that's been goaded into action
by a politician named Tanuma.

471
00:44:31,564 --> 00:44:35,568
Which means Douglas-Stewart and
this Tanuma fellow must be in cahoots.

472
00:44:35,776 --> 00:44:39,864
Moon Division is searching for
Commander Yoneda and Count Hanakouji.

473
00:44:40,072 --> 00:44:43,576
Let us away to the
Great Imperial Theater!

474
00:44:43,784 --> 00:44:47,413
We'll use the underground waterways
to go from Hibiya to the HQ hangars...

475
00:44:47,622 --> 00:44:49,832
...and grab your Koubu-Kai's there.

476
00:44:50,041 --> 00:44:52,376
We have underground waterways?

477
00:44:52,585 --> 00:44:55,796
We had them made when we
were building the subway system.

478
00:44:56,005 --> 00:44:59,467
But how are we gonna get around in 'em?

479
00:45:01,344 --> 00:45:02,803
Not to worry.

480
00:45:03,012 --> 00:45:06,098
I designed something
for just such an occasion!

481
00:45:06,307 --> 00:45:08,851
We'll use my Katsuryu-Maru!

482
00:45:13,606 --> 00:45:16,984
Um, Kohran, what's all this
machinery you have on board?

483
00:45:17,193 --> 00:45:21,739
They're upgrade parts I designed
for Koubu-Kai's and Eisenkleids!

484
00:45:21,948 --> 00:45:23,824
Just you wait!

485
00:45:31,249 --> 00:45:35,795
This is quite the picturesque
dusk cityscape, is it not?

486
00:45:38,798 --> 00:45:43,511
It doesn't hold a candle to
New York, of course.

487
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:47,098
What is it that you want us to see?

488
00:46:07,201 --> 00:46:10,121
You persist in marketing
your toys to us even now?

489
00:46:35,813 --> 00:46:37,898
What have you done?

490
00:46:39,692 --> 00:46:42,403
An impressive sight, is it not, Count?

491
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,459
Wow, so this is where it leads...

492
00:46:56,667 --> 00:46:59,086
Moving in a single pack
will bog us down. Better split up.

493
00:46:59,295 --> 00:47:00,629
You're right.

494
00:47:02,214 --> 00:47:03,549
All clear!

495
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:08,763
Hey, halt!

496
00:47:10,014 --> 00:47:11,349
Sakura!

497
00:47:15,895 --> 00:47:17,229
Shit!

498
00:47:25,488 --> 00:47:26,822
No!

499
00:47:27,323 --> 00:47:28,657
No!

500
00:47:31,369 --> 00:47:34,121
You're going too far, Miss Lachette.

501
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,749
Really? Didn't I make myself clear?

502
00:47:36,957 --> 00:47:40,086
I prefer to go with the
most efficient option, that's all.

503
00:47:40,294 --> 00:47:44,090
In any case, let's hurry to
where they're keeping our Koubu's.

504
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:46,967
Who are you?!

505
00:47:47,176 --> 00:47:51,263
Flower Division.
We're here to take back our theater.

506
00:47:51,472 --> 00:47:52,807
Karma!

507
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,229
Stand down! Your orders are to wait
on standby at the Flower Mansion!

508
00:47:58,437 --> 00:48:02,733
If I stayed there any longer,
Sumire's hysterics would drive me nuts.

509
00:48:02,942 --> 00:48:03,984
M-Miss Karma!

510
00:48:04,193 --> 00:48:06,695
Enough of this nonsense!
Have you no respect for orders?!

511
00:48:06,904 --> 00:48:10,574
We'll follow any order if
it helps safeguard our Tokyo.

512
00:48:10,783 --> 00:48:17,248
But you tell me, how is cozying up
to Douglas-Stewart good for this city?!

513
00:48:20,251 --> 00:48:21,752
Deputy Commander...

514
00:48:22,586 --> 00:48:28,342
With Commander Yoneda gone, I guess
I lost my nerve without realizing it.

515
00:48:28,551 --> 00:48:32,721
Shame on me. At times like this,
I should be the one standing firm.

516
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:35,641
You've all taught me
a valuable lesson today.

517
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:37,726
Let's do it, Deputy Commander!

518
00:48:37,935 --> 00:48:40,271
I'm gonna start upgrading the Koubu-Kai's!

519
00:48:40,479 --> 00:48:45,025
There's a lot of work that needs to
be done here, so help me out, guys!

520
00:48:45,234 --> 00:48:48,863
Imperial Fighting Troupe,
Flower Division! Prepare for dispatch!

521
00:48:52,741 --> 00:48:54,201
What do you hope to accomplish?

522
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:56,829
It would seem that the fair
maidens of Flower Division...

523
00:48:57,037 --> 00:48:59,582
...intend to defy us to the bitter end.

524
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:03,502
Some discipline would
seem to be called for.

525
00:49:04,503 --> 00:49:06,172
One would think so, anyway.

526
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:13,137
However, what if I were to suggest that we
be entrusted with the defense of Tokyo?

527
00:49:13,345 --> 00:49:15,890
Would you be amenable to this?

528
00:49:16,098 --> 00:49:18,058
I have no intention to ask for your help.

529
00:49:18,267 --> 00:49:21,479
We will guard our
imperial capital ourselves!

530
00:49:23,272 --> 00:49:28,152
What do you think those girls fight for?

531
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,323
Do you know what goes through their
minds as they fight? What they wish for?

532
00:49:32,531 --> 00:49:35,284
Do you have the slightest idea?

533
00:49:37,286 --> 00:49:38,787
Those girls are tough.

534
00:49:38,996 --> 00:49:42,917
They've done a fine job guarding this
city so far. And they'll continue to do so.

535
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:45,085
I believe in them.

536
00:49:47,463 --> 00:49:50,758
Kouma reported in the skies
over Ginza! Huge numbers, Ma'am.

537
00:50:28,587 --> 00:50:31,048
Listen, everyone! With the backpacks
that I invented attached to you,

538
00:50:31,257 --> 00:50:33,926
our maneuverability is increased by 120%!

539
00:50:34,134 --> 00:50:36,011
Okay, let's get cracking!

540
00:50:47,815 --> 00:50:52,236
Behold the Imperial Fighting Troupe!

541
00:50:53,696 --> 00:50:56,365
We will protect this city!

542
00:51:43,954 --> 00:51:46,582
Miss Kaede! Looks like
we're ready to rumble!

543
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:49,627
Our spirit power's looking good out here!

544
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:53,172
Understood!
Get into formation and stand by!

545
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,841
Dream Division ready, Ma'am.

546
00:52:12,107 --> 00:52:13,150
Spirit power sufficient!

547
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:15,235
Critical reached!

548
00:52:15,444 --> 00:52:17,946
Right! Imperial Capital
Spiritual Barricade Formation!

549
00:52:27,498 --> 00:52:29,458
Here we go!

550
00:52:41,261 --> 00:52:43,097
Hey, look!

551
00:52:43,764 --> 00:52:45,265
A Japhkiel!

552
00:52:47,101 --> 00:52:49,103
What's the big idea?!

553
00:52:58,237 --> 00:52:59,571
Leni?

554
00:53:02,491 --> 00:53:03,826
Leni!

555
00:53:25,556 --> 00:53:26,890
That's--

556
00:53:31,854 --> 00:53:33,355
Miss Orihime...

557
00:53:43,824 --> 00:53:44,491
Orihime!

558
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,201
Miss Orihime!

559
00:54:09,975 --> 00:54:11,560
Miss Orihime!

560
00:54:21,445 --> 00:54:22,780
Look out!

561
00:54:25,073 --> 00:54:26,408
Orihime!

562
00:54:36,627 --> 00:54:39,797
Orihime! Snap out of it!

563
00:54:40,756 --> 00:54:41,924
I'm sorry, Orihime.

564
00:54:42,132 --> 00:54:44,802
Let's stop wasting each other's time.

565
00:54:47,596 --> 00:54:51,225
Miss Lachette, wait!
There must be another way!

566
00:54:53,435 --> 00:54:55,562
Get out of my way!

567
00:54:55,771 --> 00:54:57,105
But“!

568
00:55:11,161 --> 00:55:12,496
No!

569
00:55:40,315 --> 00:55:41,650
Leni!

570
00:55:53,287 --> 00:55:55,831
Leni! Hold on!

571
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,918
Thanks...

572
00:56:00,127 --> 00:56:02,462
Leni! Are you okay?

573
00:56:02,671 --> 00:56:04,756
I'm okay, Iris.

574
00:56:04,965 --> 00:56:07,050
Thank goodness...

575
00:56:32,951 --> 00:56:34,453
Orihime!

576
00:56:36,914 --> 00:56:38,415
Miss Orihime!

577
00:56:48,133 --> 00:56:50,802
Orihime! Orihime!

578
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:06,109
I'm sorry... I guess I blew it.

579
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:30,801
Kayama?

580
00:57:31,009 --> 00:57:34,137
My apologies for the delay,
Count, General.

581
00:57:34,346 --> 00:57:38,225
You can relax.
We've secured the building.

582
00:57:38,433 --> 00:57:42,145
We're going to deal with that
Kouma incubation facility of yours.

583
00:57:48,443 --> 00:57:50,737
Fireworks galore!

584
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:55,450
C'mon, let's pound 'em into the dirt! Fire!

585
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:12,175
You used the Navy, didn't you?

586
00:58:12,384 --> 00:58:14,386
If there'd been even
one of those Japhkiels around,

587
00:58:14,594 --> 00:58:16,888
it wouldn't have gone this smoothly.

588
00:58:17,097 --> 00:58:20,726
Looks like your fixation on the
Imperial Theater got the better of you.

589
00:58:21,727 --> 00:58:25,105
I could easily sink your entire
Imperial Navy with my Japhkiels.

590
00:58:25,313 --> 00:58:29,109
I see you used those girls
as decoys, but it won't help you.

591
00:58:29,317 --> 00:58:31,778
Decoys? What do you take us for?

592
00:58:31,987 --> 00:58:34,156
Anyway, you've already lost.

593
00:58:34,364 --> 00:58:36,575
Are you so sure?

594
00:58:45,459 --> 00:58:46,793
Brent!

595
00:59:00,432 --> 00:59:02,851
Behave yourselves
and watch from there!

596
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:06,938
Watch your Imperial Fighting Troupe's
Flower Division wither and fall!

597
00:59:13,278 --> 00:59:14,613
Damn it!

598
00:59:44,476 --> 00:59:45,560
The Japhkiels!

599
00:59:45,769 --> 00:59:47,771
What in the world?

600
00:59:53,985 --> 00:59:56,780
Ladies of the Imperial Fighting Troupe.

601
00:59:56,988 --> 01:00:00,242
Perhaps I should introduce myself.

602
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:02,744
lam Brent Furlong.

603
01:00:02,953 --> 01:00:05,914
So you're the big cheese
of Douglas-Stewart, huh?!

604
01:00:06,123 --> 01:00:10,794
You have fought well.
Most praiseworthy, indeed.

605
01:00:11,002 --> 01:00:15,048
But I see that your
heads have grown a little swollen.

606
01:00:15,674 --> 01:00:19,177
Both you and your friends...

607
01:00:19,386 --> 01:00:22,305
This behavior simply cannot be tolerated.

608
01:00:22,514 --> 01:00:29,604
So I shall take it upon myself
to teach you your proper place!

609
01:01:00,802 --> 01:01:01,678
That's--

610
01:01:01,887 --> 01:01:04,014
Hey, look!

611
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:08,935
Captain, incoming message!

612
01:01:09,144 --> 01:01:12,397
Hi, Kayama, honey!
It's me, Kotone!

613
01:01:12,606 --> 01:01:16,568
So sorry to keep you waiting.
We just got in.

614
01:01:16,776 --> 01:01:19,404
Is that you, Seiryuin?
Then he's--

615
01:01:19,613 --> 01:01:23,658
Well, he rushed out before we
even reached our berth.

616
01:01:23,867 --> 01:01:26,453
Honestly, that boy can be so impatient.

617
01:01:26,661 --> 01:01:27,579
I see.

618
01:01:27,787 --> 01:01:29,831
Okay, it's all yours now!

619
01:01:30,832 --> 01:01:31,750
General.

620
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:33,293
Right.

621
01:01:33,752 --> 01:01:35,420
Deputy Commander!

622
01:01:42,344 --> 01:01:43,386
Sakura!

623
01:01:43,595 --> 01:01:46,640
Just look at the size of it!

624
01:02:13,708 --> 01:02:15,460
Please!

625
01:02:15,669 --> 01:02:17,003
Move!

626
01:02:24,844 --> 01:02:27,097
My Eisenkleid...

627
01:02:29,975 --> 01:02:31,893
Bastard!

628
01:02:43,113 --> 01:02:44,739
Karma, are you okay?!

629
01:02:44,948 --> 01:02:46,491
Yeah, I guess.

630
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,410
Miss Sakura, are you all right?

631
01:02:48,618 --> 01:02:50,245
Y-Yes! I can still fight.

632
01:02:50,453 --> 01:02:53,123
Miss Lachette! What's
the matter, Miss Lachette?!

633
01:02:53,331 --> 01:02:57,669
It's no use... It won't budge.

634
01:02:57,877 --> 01:03:00,588
My Eisenkleid...

635
01:03:01,589 --> 01:03:03,258
Miss Lachette...

636
01:03:11,057 --> 01:03:15,562
This is bad! Everybody's spirit
power is falling off.

637
01:03:16,896 --> 01:03:19,441
What are we supposed to do?

638
01:03:23,945 --> 01:03:26,906
This glorious Imperial Capital
of yours comes to an end today.

639
01:03:27,115 --> 01:03:29,409
I'll crush it beneath my feet.

640
01:03:29,617 --> 01:03:33,413
You may call it an Imperial Capital,
but in the end, it's nothing!

641
01:03:33,621 --> 01:03:37,792
It's utterly insignificant
in the face of my Japhkiel!

642
01:03:38,793 --> 01:03:40,462
You.“
wrong.

643
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:48,261
It may seem like a small town to you,
but countless lives are lived here.

644
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:51,056
Each and every person spends his days...

645
01:03:51,264 --> 01:03:55,268
...accompanied by sorrow,
joy, anger, suffering, or sadness.

646
01:03:55,477 --> 01:03:59,105
They all live their lives
as best as they can.

647
01:03:59,314 --> 01:04:03,777
How dare you... How dare you
dismiss all that as insignificant?!

648
01:04:03,985 --> 01:04:07,405
As long as smiles remain on the
faces of those we love in this city,

649
01:04:07,614 --> 01:04:09,616
we won't be defeated!

650
01:04:14,662 --> 01:04:16,331
Miss Sakura!

651
01:04:29,135 --> 01:04:30,887
The Japhkiel is taking cannon fire!

652
01:04:31,096 --> 01:04:34,682
Flying object inbound at high speed!
Its speed is incredible!

653
01:04:55,453 --> 01:04:57,789
Are you all right, Sakura?

654
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:00,917
Yes, Sir!

655
01:05:04,421 --> 01:05:05,797
Sorry I took so long.

656
01:05:06,005 --> 01:05:06,673
Lieutenant!

657
01:05:06,881 --> 01:05:07,507
Big brother!

658
01:05:07,715 --> 01:05:08,508
Captain!

659
01:05:08,716 --> 01:05:10,135
Mr. Oogami!

660
01:05:10,343 --> 01:05:11,845
Hello, everyone.

661
01:05:17,183 --> 01:05:20,061
Damn you...!

662
01:05:35,827 --> 01:05:37,704
Hey, that's it! That sound!

663
01:05:37,912 --> 01:05:40,081
Mr. Oogami! Everybody! I figured it out!

664
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:41,124
You serious?

665
01:05:41,332 --> 01:05:42,959
What are you going on about?

666
01:05:43,168 --> 01:05:43,835
Sound!

667
01:05:44,043 --> 01:05:48,756
All those Japhkiels are being controlled
by a special sound unique to each one!

668
01:05:48,965 --> 01:05:52,385
Does that mean some
fixed frequency is being used?

669
01:05:52,594 --> 01:05:53,761
Exactly!

670
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:55,096
Sharp as always, Mr. Oogami!

671
01:05:55,305 --> 01:05:58,475
Just you watch! I'm gonna
make that thing go to pieces!

672
01:05:58,683 --> 01:06:02,687
Those big ol' arms of his
are kinda in the way, though.

673
01:06:06,483 --> 01:06:08,485
In that case...

674
01:06:10,361 --> 01:06:13,865
...we'll just have to
do something about 'em!

675
01:06:21,289 --> 01:06:24,000
I knew I could count on you two!

676
01:06:53,613 --> 01:06:54,948
Mr. Oogami!

677
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,450
Iris, I need a lift!

678
01:06:58,034 --> 01:06:59,536
Um, sure!

679
01:07:53,798 --> 01:07:54,924
Sakura.

680
01:07:55,133 --> 01:07:56,467
Sir?

681
01:07:57,927 --> 01:08:02,473
You did a great job.
I can't thank you enough.

682
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,143
No, Sir.

683
01:08:05,351 --> 01:08:11,107
Flower Division was able to carry
on this far thanks to you, Mr. Oogami.

684
01:08:12,108 --> 01:08:17,488
More than anything else, it was
because you were here that we won.

685
01:08:21,701 --> 01:08:25,038
What a grand victory for the Imperial
Fighting Troupe's Flower Division!

686
01:08:25,246 --> 01:08:28,750
Oh, right! There's
one little thing I forgot to do!

687
01:08:29,417 --> 01:08:31,294
Hey, you!

688
01:08:33,755 --> 01:08:38,801
You're Japanese, ain't ya?
Show a little pride in your country!

689
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:43,306
That's what makes those girls so strong.

690
01:08:53,316 --> 01:08:55,943
It's been a long time, Patrick.

691
01:08:56,152 --> 01:08:57,737
You're still alive?

692
01:08:57,945 --> 01:08:59,739
Here I am, no thanks to you.

693
01:08:59,947 --> 01:09:03,284
This time, I'll make sure you're dead!

694
01:09:04,118 --> 01:09:08,289
You really shouldn't
make threats like that lightly.

695
01:09:16,589 --> 01:09:22,011
You're out of ammunition.
Not that bullets work on me, anyway.

696
01:09:32,522 --> 01:09:34,065
Why?

697
01:09:34,273 --> 01:09:39,487
I forgot to mention it, but that round
was charged up with spirit power.

698
01:09:41,197 --> 01:09:44,117
Sweet dreams, Patrick.

699
01:09:48,287 --> 01:09:52,208
"The Great Imperial Opera
House Presents Kaijin Bessou"

700
01:09:52,458 --> 01:09:55,670
When Maria showed up all battered
and bruised, we were shocked.

701
01:09:55,878 --> 01:09:58,297
We couldn't get back to the Imperial
Theater with the Army guarding it,

702
01:09:58,506 --> 01:10:00,216
so we were at a
loss as to what to do.

703
01:10:00,425 --> 01:10:04,053
Thanks for looking after her.
I appreciate it. Thank you.

704
01:10:04,262 --> 01:10:06,848
We thought about telling the team,

705
01:10:07,056 --> 01:10:09,559
but like they say, "To deceive your
enemies, first deceive your friends."

706
01:10:09,767 --> 01:10:11,894
Everyone was pretty mad.

707
01:10:12,103 --> 01:10:14,939
I can live with that. I'm just one of
Flower Division's unseen stage crew.

708
01:10:15,148 --> 01:10:18,735
It's different from what you do,
but I try to help them in my own--

709
01:10:19,736 --> 01:10:23,281
The intermission is about to end.

710
01:10:23,489 --> 01:10:24,449
Let's watch it with the audience.

711
01:10:24,657 --> 01:10:25,825
Sure.

712
01:10:26,033 --> 01:10:27,702
It pleases me to see you, my Princess.

713
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:29,912
What troubles you?

714
01:10:30,955 --> 01:10:33,291
I am gripped with fear.

715
01:10:33,499 --> 01:10:36,085
Young Master, please remove your armor.

716
01:10:36,294 --> 01:10:40,047
Dressed so, it is only
natural that she fears you.

717
01:10:40,256 --> 01:10:42,467
You must not fear this!

718
01:10:42,675 --> 01:10:45,303
It is because of
this that I am strong!

719
01:10:45,511 --> 01:10:49,265
This was what allowed me to save
the Lady in Waiting from the sharks.

720
01:10:50,433 --> 01:10:53,811
Alas, I have come
to a land filled with terror...

721
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:56,397
ls there such a thing
as a nation without enemies?

722
01:10:56,606 --> 01:11:00,526
Foes abound in every quarter.
I need only defeat them!

723
01:11:22,131 --> 01:11:25,968
I will be victorious!
Clad in this armor, I will protect you...

724
01:11:26,177 --> 01:11:28,012
...from my enemies and the world!

...that I must slay you.

750
01:14:20,518 --> 01:14:22,103
Why must you?

751
01:14:22,311 --> 01:14:26,565
Need I a reason?
You are mine to do with as I please.

752
01:14:26,774 --> 01:14:30,111
As king, should I not do as I please?

753
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:32,113
That's not her line!

754
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:35,783
Could she be under someone's control?

755
01:14:40,329 --> 01:14:41,956
You are powerless before me.

756
01:14:42,164 --> 01:14:45,251
I hold your life in my hands.

757
01:14:45,459 --> 01:14:49,338
Such pleasure... Such pleasure
I take in knowing this.

758
01:14:49,547 --> 01:14:53,926
To think I would be treated
so by one who claims to love me...

759
01:14:54,135 --> 01:14:56,762
Could it be that you are under the spell...

760
01:14:56,971 --> 01:15:00,808
...of the Demon King
who dwells above on land?

761
01:15:08,607 --> 01:15:10,276
This is bad! This is really bad!

762
01:15:10,484 --> 01:15:12,570
Get that lift down here!

763
01:15:15,072 --> 01:15:18,826
Know this. My heart
is dominated by no one.

764
01:15:19,035 --> 01:15:23,205
Know this. What rules my heart...

765
01:15:23,414 --> 01:15:26,542
...is deep, deep...

766
01:15:27,543 --> 01:15:29,587
...hatred.

767
01:15:29,795 --> 01:15:31,672
A heart of hate?

768
01:15:31,881 --> 01:15:34,633
How can this be?
You, who possess all?

769
01:15:34,842 --> 01:15:36,927
I held power over all things.

770
01:15:37,136 --> 01:15:41,390
Alas, people knew not what my
heart held, and so they abandoned me.

771
01:15:41,599 --> 01:15:43,893
As will you, you who blossoms so!

772
01:15:44,101 --> 01:15:49,523
But l... I was born a king!

773
01:15:49,732 --> 01:15:52,401
Because I had everything...

774
01:15:53,402 --> 01:15:58,282
...no one could understand my
torment at having lost everything!

775
01:15:59,283 --> 01:16:04,246
I tried to be nobler than all others.
More powerful than all others.

776
01:16:04,455 --> 01:16:09,085
Even after selling my soul to the demons of
the land, I attempted to protect my dignity.

777
01:16:09,293 --> 01:16:11,837
--Is Lachette...?
--No, not one so noble as you!

778
01:16:12,046 --> 01:16:16,592
lam now mired in mud, warped
hideously down to my very heart!

779
01:16:16,801 --> 01:16:19,428
--And so my heart is now filled with spite!
--Believe in them.

780
01:16:19,637 --> 01:16:20,930
Wait, I beg you!

781
01:16:21,138 --> 01:16:25,893
If only for a brief moment,
we shared a common dream!

782
01:16:26,102 --> 01:16:27,436
What of it?

783
01:16:27,645 --> 01:16:30,856
Shared dreams join
together and become the future!

784
01:16:31,065 --> 01:16:33,400
I say again, what of it?

785
01:16:33,609 --> 01:16:37,988
We laughed together,
fought together, and dreamed together.

786
01:16:38,197 --> 01:16:41,408
We have shared
this place with one another.

787
01:16:41,617 --> 01:16:44,245
<i>'An. 'an.</i>

788
01:16:44,453 --> 01:16:47,123
I love you dearly!

789
01:16:58,884 --> 01:17:04,557
My Prince, will slaying your defenseless
wife lift the burden from your heart?

790
01:17:04,765 --> 01:17:07,476
Let me bear the brunt of your rage.

791
01:17:07,685 --> 01:17:10,229
Companions, companions, companions...

792
01:17:10,437 --> 01:17:13,649
Ah, I feel my
heart turning cold as ice!

793
01:17:13,858 --> 01:17:16,569
This world is rife with enemies!

794
01:17:16,777 --> 01:17:21,740
You have already shared your heart
among us, for you are with us here.

795
01:17:21,949 --> 01:17:28,289
If you say you desire my life,
I will gladly give it.

796
01:17:28,497 --> 01:17:33,335
I commend your resolve.
Die, then, at my hand.

797
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:39,008
To demonstrate my power, I conspired
with the Demon King of the lands above...

798
01:17:39,216 --> 01:17:41,719
...and attempted to
bring chaos to the world!

799
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,430
I have no place to call home.

800
01:17:44,638 --> 01:17:49,143
Let us go to our deaths.
First you, and then I will follow!

801
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:53,397
Cast your hatred upon me, Princess!

802
01:17:55,149 --> 01:17:57,568
I bear you no hatred.

803
01:17:57,776 --> 01:18:01,822
Hatred gives rise to further hatred.

804
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:06,535
I forgive all you have done.

805
01:18:15,753 --> 01:18:17,087
I forgive you.

806
01:18:17,463 --> 01:18:18,797
I forgive you.

807
01:18:19,173 --> 01:18:20,507
I forgive you.

808
01:18:20,883 --> 01:18:22,218
I forgive you.

809
01:18:22,801 --> 01:18:24,094
I forgive you.

810
01:18:24,303 --> 01:18:25,638
I forgive you.

811
01:18:26,138 --> 01:18:27,473
I forgive you.

812
01:18:29,266 --> 01:18:32,269
I will not be deceived!
This is nothing but a story!

813
01:18:32,478 --> 01:18:35,856
I shall bring down the curtain!
I shall bring all stories to an end!

814
01:18:36,065 --> 01:18:38,275
Will it be so?

815
01:18:38,484 --> 01:18:42,529
Will lowering the curtain on this
story bring all stories to an end?

816
01:18:42,738 --> 01:18:45,950
As long as people live...

817
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:49,495
...the stories will never end.

818
01:18:53,249 --> 01:18:54,959
Enough of this!

819
01:18:55,167 --> 01:18:58,462
I shall slay this story
by my own hand!

<i>'An. 'an.</i>

821
01:19:32,663 --> 01:19:39,586
I cannot bring myself to kill my love,
my dreams, or my friends.

822
01:19:39,795 --> 01:19:42,548
This blood I shed is yours.

823
01:19:42,756 --> 01:19:48,262
The blood of hatred has flowed to
the sea, and now a new story is born.

824
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:51,640
Let this moment continue a while longer.

825
01:19:51,849 --> 01:19:54,601
In being able to wish so,
I have found happiness.

826
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:59,398
There are as many tales bursting forth
in this realm as there are people in it.

827
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:02,651
Flowers appear before us.

828
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:07,656
In this time and in this place,
countless flowers of dreams blossom!

829
01:20:07,865 --> 01:20:10,534
They bloom with all their might!
