1
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:03,137
It doesn't matter when you fought,

2
00:02:03,138 --> 00:02:05,241
what weapons you used...

3
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,779
who you call your enemy.

4
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,313
One day,

5
00:02:12,314 --> 00:02:14,450
one way or the other,

6
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:16,554
you go home.

7
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:23,592
Be calm.

8
00:02:23,593 --> 00:02:25,994
- Where's the medic?
- I'm not gonna make it.

9
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:27,596
Medic!

10
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:30,068
Damn it, where's the medic?!

11
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:33,804
Chill! Fuck. Stay still, damn it!

12
00:02:35,404 --> 00:02:36,673
Medic!

13
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:40,276
Damn it, where's the medic?

14
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:46,081
Ladies and gentlemen,

15
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,450
we are pleased to welcome
you to Los Angeles.

16
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:51,385
The local time is 12:10 p.m.

17
00:02:51,386 --> 00:02:54,355
and it's a clear 72°.

18
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:57,863
If Los Angeles happens to be
your final destination...

19
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:55,620
...that.

20
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,745
The shrinks call it
post-traumatic stress disorder.

21
00:04:56,746 --> 00:04:58,714
I call it hell.

22
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,550
The demons are waiting
in each corner,

23
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,752
ready to drag me back
to the battlefield.

24
00:05:03,753 --> 00:05:05,454
I'm not gonna make it!

25
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:07,892
Stay still, stay still, damn it.

26
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:19,601
I still couldn't talk to my family.

27
00:05:19,602 --> 00:05:22,170
My old man worked his ass ragged

28
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:24,041
so I could go to college.

29
00:05:24,974 --> 00:05:26,944
But I enlisted instead.

30
00:05:52,635 --> 00:05:54,237
You guys need help?

31
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:57,609
Graveyard shift, 11:00 to 7:00.

32
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,242
$3.49.

33
00:06:00,243 --> 00:06:02,480
You guys have an application?

34
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,619
- Who do I bring back to?
- Just bring it back and drop it off.

35
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,690
It's not that hard.

36
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,857
Thanks.

37
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:19,230
And learn these words:
"Thank you, come again."

38
00:06:34,443 --> 00:06:36,545
I guess I was doing
a pretty lousy job

39
00:06:36,546 --> 00:06:39,447
of adjusting to civilian life.

40
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:42,320
But I was about to get
pulled into a whole new war.

41
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:50,726
Smile for the camera.

42
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:53,362
Vin, a handyman turned businessman,

43
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:56,331
was trying to get into business
with a smuggler named Bennet

44
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,700
on behalf of his boss Hollis...

45
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:01,536
a pimp and gangster on his way up.

46
00:07:01,537 --> 00:07:04,206
This would trigger a series
of unfortunate events

47
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,845
with some of L.A's lowest lowlives.

48
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:19,454
Things went from bad to worse
when two cops got involved...

49
00:07:19,455 --> 00:07:22,090
Mitchell a detective
with an' attitude...

50
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:25,193
- Fuck you!
- ...and his partner Farragut...

51
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,197
all over a girl.

52
00:07:29,265 --> 00:07:31,402
One of Hollis's girls.

53
00:07:57,427 --> 00:07:58,827
What the hell do you want?

54
00:07:58,828 --> 00:08:00,196
Is Bennet aquí?

55
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:02,964
Gordon?

56
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:05,367
Your <i>puta</i> racist <i>maricón</i>
friend is here.

57
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:08,407
I'm watching the telly.
Send him in.

58
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:30,493
All right, Pop.

59
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,700
- Hey, mate, how you doin'?
- All right.

60
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,469
Don't worry about her. That's
just Sondra being Sondra.

61
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,907
Oh aye, the red carpet and all.

62
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:45,373
You see, Vin,

63
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:47,042
this is what I'm up against now.

64
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:49,711
I'm sitting here watching
the beautiful game

65
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:51,582
in fucking Mexican.

66
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:56,087
Yeah, I love you too, love.

67
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,123
Fuck sports.

68
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,059
You get all the games
from back home, eh?

69
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,632
You come here to talk sports, Vin?

70
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:11,867
Hollis. He's got the money,

71
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:13,268
you've got the connections.

72
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:15,303
I'll sort out the distribution.

73
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,072
We all make a few bucks.

74
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:19,307
You don't even have
to talk to Hollis.

75
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,743
Well, that's a relief, isn't it?

76
00:09:21,744 --> 00:09:23,645
You only have to talk to me.

77
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,847
That's a deal. Take it.

78
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:27,618
Take it, Bennet. Come on.

79
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,453
You cram fucker.

80
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:32,787
You're becoming a good
fucking salesman,

81
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,190
I'll give you that, Vin.

82
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:37,726
Ah, fuck it. A deal's a deal.

83
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:39,630
Back to square one...

84
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,697
my crappy motel

85
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:44,735
where I was trying to
make sense of life.

86
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:49,704
Little did I know

87
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:52,276
life made no sense whatsoever.

88
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,451
And I was about to
learn it the hard way.

89
00:10:15,965 --> 00:10:18,703
Get your hands off of me. Stop it!

90
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:21,872
Stop it, don't touch me!

91
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:29,981
Don't touch my shit!

92
00:10:35,586 --> 00:10:37,018
Check her fucking purse.

93
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,321
- Don't fucking touch my shit.
- Bitch, shut the fuck up.

94
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:41,656
- Fuck you!
- Shut your fucking mouth.

95
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:43,992
Shut your goddamn mouth now.

96
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:46,695
You fucking bitch, what
the fuck did I tell you?

97
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:49,565
Heep your fucking mouth shut, don't
touch me or I'm gonna give you

98
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,066
- to the fucking niggers.
- All right.

99
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,602
They'll have your ass for free.

100
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:55,203
How much fucking money is in there?

101
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:58,778
I take what I get from
you guys. Fuck you!

102
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,344
You fucking nasty-ass bitch
touch me one more time

103
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:04,079
and I'm gonna break
your fucking neck.

104
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,448
Get your nasty ass back out there

105
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:07,916
and make some fucking money.

106
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,218
Hey, leave her alone.

107
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:11,387
It's a private party, man.

108
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:19,328
Dude, get that Chink out of here!

109
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:27,671
- Hyah!
- Tony!

110
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,009
Chinese motherf... ugh!

111
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,452
Fuck.

112
00:12:32,469 --> 00:12:33,536
Oh shit.

113
00:12:39,775 --> 00:12:41,342
Oh shit!

114
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,745
- You okay?
- Oh my God, no.

115
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:46,181
Oh my God. Do you know
who these guys are?

116
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,383
- Why, should I?
- Yeah, 'cause you should know

117
00:12:48,384 --> 00:12:50,318
who you're fucking with if
you're gonna fuck with them!

118
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:52,122
That's why.

119
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,224
Want some of this?

120
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:57,792
Yeah, I do.

121
00:12:57,793 --> 00:13:00,030
I got a fucking long way to go now.

122
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:03,832
You just fucking killed me.

123
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,501
How the fuck am I supposed to know?

124
00:13:05,502 --> 00:13:06,835
They were hurting you.

125
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:09,106
They hurt me every fucking week.

126
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,680
God damn it, what the
fuck am I gonna do now?

127
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:19,548
You got somewhere else
to go, you should just go.

128
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,050
Or you can wait for
the cops to show up

129
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,653
and tell them that you
just jacked these fools

130
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:26,691
for a ho that ain't
even here no more.

131
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,833
I know that you think
that you're helping me...

132
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:40,337
it really ain't worth it, okay?

133
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:43,406
Thank you.

134
00:14:10,801 --> 00:14:13,168
Fuck!

135
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:15,504
Fuck fuck fuck!

136
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:17,976
Fuck! Fuck!

137
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,722
Oh, shit, Si.

138
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:08,726
You look like you got hit by a bus.

139
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:13,863
Who did this thing?

140
00:15:13,864 --> 00:15:16,101
S... some guy.

141
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:18,500
One guy?

142
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,669
Mm-hmm.

143
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,971
Carsen and Mikey were roughing up

144
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:25,206
that little whore you
keep up in room #9.

145
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:26,843
Tanya. Hmm.

146
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:30,713
This dude, he just
lives there. He...

147
00:15:30,714 --> 00:15:33,716
he come around and
he fucked up Tony.

148
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:35,851
And me.

149
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,086
After that, I don't know.

150
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:40,391
I just woke up here.

151
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:49,465
Well, he killed Carsen...

152
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:51,836
shoved Mikey's knife up his throat.

153
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:55,439
Mikey's dead too... asphyxiated.

154
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,577
Crushed windpipe.

155
00:16:00,276 --> 00:16:01,844
What about Tony?

156
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:03,311
He'll make it.

157
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:05,547
One of his testicles got
crushed and infected,

158
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,683
so they'll have to cut them off.

159
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:10,455
Probably won't be
able to talk so good.

160
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,365
You gotta cut off his balls, too.

161
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:24,833
I may do just that.

162
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:27,201
You know his name?

163
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:29,203
Just some quiet guy.

164
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:31,205
He's a Chink or something.

165
00:16:31,206 --> 00:16:34,111
Well, it's them quiet ones
you gotta look out for.

166
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:37,011
Hey.

167
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:38,747
Don't say nothing to the cops.

168
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,248
We'll do this our way.

169
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,219
Right on.

170
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,588
Right on.

171
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,535
Hey, you've reached my voicemail.

172
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:01,436
Please leave me a message.

173
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,438
It's Hollis.

174
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,774
There's been a problem.
You ain't in none yet,

175
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,578
but you best call me real quick.

176
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,970
- Hey.
- Hey.

177
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,171
- Vegas?
- $40.

178
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:38,741
$40? Well...

179
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:39,977
just keep this.

180
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:44,881
There you go.

181
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:48,286
Just...

182
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,065
Tanya honey, where are you?

183
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:06,036
I'm scared, Hollis.

184
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:09,571
Oh, sweetheart, you have
nothing to worry about.

185
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:11,474
I know it wasn't your fault.

186
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:15,443
- You at the bus station?
- Yeah.

187
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:17,649
I'm coming to pick you up.

188
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:36,833
Fuck.

189
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,353
That... that jerk Carsen...

190
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:01,155
he got rough with me

191
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:02,925
and this guy came out of nowhere.

192
00:19:02,926 --> 00:19:05,928
Yeah, he lived two doors down
from where I had you staying.

193
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:08,196
It's not like I said stuff
to him or nothing.

194
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:10,364
- But he didn't come from nowhere.
- Okay,

195
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:12,701
so I screamed a little when
Carsen pulled my hair.

196
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:15,169
This soldier boy and you
got something going?

197
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,673
- No.
- Tanya, don't fuck with me.

198
00:19:17,674 --> 00:19:20,341
Okay, you know what?
I did not ask for any of this shit.

199
00:19:20,342 --> 00:19:23,512
I... Carsen... he got
too rough with me.

200
00:19:23,513 --> 00:19:25,446
He got mean. He said
these two tweakers,

201
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:28,216
that they could tag-team me
and share me or some shit

202
00:19:28,217 --> 00:19:31,056
- and teach me a lesson.
- All right, quiet down.

203
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,059
I just...

204
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,528
wanna go back to, like, the
way it used to be, you know?

205
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:42,064
Like, you used to...
used to take me places,

206
00:19:42,065 --> 00:19:44,970
really nice... really nice places.

207
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:49,374
We used to... we used to
sleep in your bed together.

208
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:54,378
You know? Remember?

209
00:19:56,813 --> 00:19:58,983
I don't like it like this.

210
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,684
Of course you don't.

211
00:20:02,685 --> 00:20:05,624
Huh. Wanna come home with me?

212
00:20:08,158 --> 00:20:10,328
Yeah, I do.

213
00:20:39,556 --> 00:20:41,623
I waited all night for you.

214
00:20:41,624 --> 00:20:43,426
Who is she?

215
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,229
Just a loose end.

216
00:20:47,197 --> 00:20:49,031
Clean this shit up.
Get the twats sold.

217
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:50,398
We got work to do.

218
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:52,433
Can we let this little
bitch come first?

219
00:20:52,434 --> 00:20:54,670
What'd you say?

220
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,738
Can we let this little
bitch come first?

221
00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:59,176
Carsen and Mikey got
killed last night.

222
00:21:01,544 --> 00:21:04,813
- You fuckin' heard him. Get out!
- Get the fuck out of here.

223
00:21:04,814 --> 00:21:07,082
- Let's go, move it.
- Get up. Get out.

224
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,886
Get this bitch out.

225
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:16,692
I was going to need help.

226
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,963
J.P. was the one guy I could trust.

227
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,642
We gotta go to the cops.

228
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:07,709
It was self-defense.
You'll get off.

229
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,611
Not what I did.

230
00:22:09,612 --> 00:22:12,648
John, I'm telling
you as your friend,

231
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:14,348
go to the police.

232
00:22:14,349 --> 00:22:17,052
You're a vet, man.
Who they gonna believe?

233
00:22:17,053 --> 00:22:18,887
Some cranked-up assholes or you?

234
00:22:18,888 --> 00:22:21,256
- You're a fucking war hero.
- War hero?

235
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,258
No one gives a shit about us.

236
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,027
Don't be stupid, John.

237
00:22:25,028 --> 00:22:26,898
Just go to the cops.

238
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:41,277
Make sure we have all that tip-top.

239
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:52,489
Hey, let him go.

240
00:22:53,723 --> 00:22:55,358
He's okay.

241
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,778
Oh, what the fuck else? Damn.

242
00:23:13,776 --> 00:23:15,177
Whoa.

243
00:23:15,178 --> 00:23:17,179
- Morning, Carl.
- Hey, Hollis.

244
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,448
What you doin' here?

245
00:23:19,381 --> 00:23:21,149
Been something of a ruckus,

246
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,087
some people I know got hurt, Carl.

247
00:23:24,454 --> 00:23:26,755
- You think I would ignore that?
- No.

248
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:28,458
Come... come on in.

249
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:34,830
Oh, excuse... sorry.

250
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,099
Jesus H. Christ, Carl.

251
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,634
Even crackheads live
better than you.

252
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:42,971
Well hey, you know what?
I was gonna clean up today, so...

253
00:23:42,972 --> 00:23:45,907
I don't give a shit how
you keep yourself.

254
00:23:45,908 --> 00:23:48,680
Do you want the key to Simon's?

255
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:52,446
The Chink... quiet guy,
what's his name?

256
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:54,752
Um, you mean John?

257
00:23:55,885 --> 00:23:57,786
- Is he the quiet Chink?
- Uh... oh,

258
00:23:57,787 --> 00:23:58,989
I guess so.

259
00:23:59,956 --> 00:24:03,458
Then fucking yes,
I mean fucking John.

260
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:05,293
Okay, uh, what about him?

261
00:24:05,294 --> 00:24:07,863
- Everything.
- All right, listen.

262
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:10,132
Mr. Hollis, I'm confused.

263
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:13,735
No, you're stupid,
so I'll lay it out for you.

264
00:24:13,736 --> 00:24:15,871
I wanna know everything
about him that you do.

265
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,239
- What?
- He's staying here,

266
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,207
so you'll have a copy
of his driver's license.

267
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,309
I'll start with that.
Then I'll have his keys

268
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,146
while you write down a list of
everything you know about him.

269
00:24:24,147 --> 00:24:26,785
- Where he works.
- Costmart.

270
00:24:30,353 --> 00:24:32,521
- Carl?
- What?

271
00:24:32,522 --> 00:24:34,122
Hmm?

272
00:24:34,123 --> 00:24:36,191
I don't like you much.

273
00:24:36,192 --> 00:24:38,260
I just keep you here
'cause you just got

274
00:24:38,261 --> 00:24:40,362
enough instinct towards
self-preservation

275
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:42,798
not to be a liability. But
if you interrupt me again,

276
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,167
I swear to God, that
folder with the photos

277
00:24:45,168 --> 00:24:47,369
will go to the D.A.

278
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,204
I'm sorry, Holl...

279
00:24:49,205 --> 00:24:51,873
I... Mr. Hollis.

280
00:24:51,874 --> 00:24:54,476
So again, before I choke

281
00:24:54,477 --> 00:24:57,412
on the stink of this
shit-pile you call home,

282
00:24:57,413 --> 00:25:00,081
everything you have on
John the quiet Chink...

283
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,284
- Right.
- ...and the keys to his apartment

284
00:25:02,285 --> 00:25:04,786
and a written list of
everything you know about him:

285
00:25:04,787 --> 00:25:07,722
where he works, what he drives,

286
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:11,059
who he knows, who you've
seen come through here.

287
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,994
- Right.
- Every...

288
00:25:12,995 --> 00:25:15,030
fucking thing.

289
00:25:15,031 --> 00:25:17,669
I'm... get... the key.

290
00:25:20,536 --> 00:25:21,904
Um, 205.

291
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:37,288
Fuck you.

292
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:40,757
Copy that.

293
00:26:13,457 --> 00:26:15,257
You gonna crash on the couch?

294
00:26:15,258 --> 00:26:16,894
You still gonna sleep there?

295
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,861
I'll be back later.

296
00:26:19,862 --> 00:26:22,430
If they know it's me,
they'll bust me. If not...

297
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:24,301
If not, you'll tell
them what went down.

298
00:26:25,268 --> 00:26:26,701
Maybe.

299
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:28,538
Cool?

300
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:30,508
Heep a tight ass, brother.

301
00:26:58,067 --> 00:27:00,435
Excuse me. Detective Mitchell.

302
00:27:00,436 --> 00:27:01,803
- Yes sir?
- Got a minute?

303
00:27:01,804 --> 00:27:03,038
Yes, I do.

304
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,940
So are you staying in this place?

305
00:27:04,941 --> 00:27:07,075
Yes sir, in 205.

306
00:27:07,076 --> 00:27:08,677
- John Nguyen.
- John.

307
00:27:08,678 --> 00:27:09,779
Can I inspect some I.D.?

308
00:27:17,153 --> 00:27:18,820
That's a different address.

309
00:27:18,821 --> 00:27:20,355
It's my parents.

310
00:27:20,356 --> 00:27:22,491
I just came back from overseas.

311
00:27:22,492 --> 00:27:24,659
- Military?
- Yes sir. Army.

312
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,329
Hind of figured that.

313
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,431
- Thank you for your service.
- Of course.

314
00:27:29,432 --> 00:27:32,501
I don't mean to pry, but I'm
just trying to figure out

315
00:27:32,502 --> 00:27:34,235
what the hell you're doing here.

316
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,004
It's just temporary.

317
00:27:36,005 --> 00:27:40,809
Well, not for nothing,
but it's kind of a bad place.

318
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,747
The sooner you move on, the better.

319
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:45,381
What happened?

320
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:49,588
Eh, just a couple of scumbags
wasting taxpayers' money.

321
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:51,853
That's too bad.

322
00:27:51,854 --> 00:27:54,590
Here's my card.
Detective Mitchell.

323
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,324
You need something,

324
00:27:56,325 --> 00:27:58,193
you hear something,
you let me know.

325
00:27:58,194 --> 00:28:00,197
- Yes sir. Thank you.
- All right.

326
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:05,400
Hey, kid. What'd you
do in the army?

327
00:28:05,401 --> 00:28:08,106
Mostly whatever I was told.

328
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:10,507
Roger that.

329
00:28:12,808 --> 00:28:14,443
What a fucking dump.

330
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:23,420
Oh, you're still here.

331
00:28:24,387 --> 00:28:25,854
Yep.

332
00:28:25,855 --> 00:28:27,822
Do you work for Hollis?

333
00:28:27,823 --> 00:28:29,558
Um, kind of.

334
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:32,794
- You?
- Nothing like that.

335
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:34,364
Nothing like what?

336
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,332
You see, he's starting this

337
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:40,503
- video production company.
- Let me see if I remember:

338
00:28:40,504 --> 00:28:43,472
he's starting this
production company.

339
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:46,074
Got the name, like,
copyrighted and everything.

340
00:28:46,075 --> 00:28:48,410
Hmm? He's gonna make
you the big star.

341
00:28:48,411 --> 00:28:51,146
You'll make, like, six figures
in the first year easy.

342
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:54,182
Mainly girl-on-girl... none of
that hardcore shit, you know?

343
00:28:54,183 --> 00:28:56,485
Oh, but hey, the investors?

344
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:58,186
Really wealthy guys,

345
00:28:58,187 --> 00:29:00,422
so if you wanna, like, take 'em
out, show 'em a good time,

346
00:29:00,423 --> 00:29:01,823
they tip really really well.

347
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,825
And it'll get the
company up and running.

348
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:06,297
Is that about right?

349
00:29:07,263 --> 00:29:09,297
- I am nothing like you.
- Oooh.

350
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:11,803
What do you like better
on me? Black or pink?

351
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:35,392
You sure look pretty
all cleaned up.

352
00:29:36,926 --> 00:29:38,796
I ain't slept like that in forever.

353
00:29:41,465 --> 00:29:43,164
I shaved for you.

354
00:29:43,165 --> 00:29:44,866
I'm sure the boys
will appreciate that.

355
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,569
What?

356
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:49,605
What was going on in that
little mind of yours?

357
00:29:49,606 --> 00:29:51,709
You think we was going
steady or something?

358
00:29:52,942 --> 00:29:55,511
I mean, how many dicks
have you had up inside you

359
00:29:55,512 --> 00:29:57,011
since we last fucked?

360
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:58,446
500?

361
00:29:58,447 --> 00:29:59,515
1,000 maybe?

362
00:30:01,585 --> 00:30:03,686
You think 'cause you shaved
the hair off your snatch,

363
00:30:03,687 --> 00:30:05,523
I was gonna forget
that little detail?

364
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:08,957
I don't...

365
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:10,925
I don't really know. I thought...

366
00:30:10,926 --> 00:30:13,261
I know you didn't like
Carsen and Mikey,

367
00:30:13,262 --> 00:30:15,099
but they were my brothers.

368
00:30:16,132 --> 00:30:17,932
I didn't have nothing
to do with that.

369
00:30:17,933 --> 00:30:20,470
Yes, you did, Tanya. You did.

370
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,839
I know it ain't fair.

371
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,008
Besides, what about
that bus ticket?

372
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:28,677
How'd you get money for that?

373
00:30:28,678 --> 00:30:30,780
Did you steal it from my guys?

374
00:30:30,781 --> 00:30:33,081
Come on, Tanya. You know better.

375
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,717
You think I'm gonna let you go?

376
00:30:34,718 --> 00:30:37,486
Here's where you belong,
working for me.

377
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:39,456
It's as simple as that.

378
00:30:48,964 --> 00:30:52,267
I don't really like the
color of the walls at all.

379
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:55,003
Yellow or something
like that for you.

380
00:30:55,004 --> 00:30:57,405
Hey, I was in the garage,

381
00:30:57,406 --> 00:30:59,340
and I was putting your shoes

382
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:00,810
in those boxes that you like.

383
00:31:00,811 --> 00:31:03,311
You know, we got
moths, by the way.

384
00:31:03,312 --> 00:31:05,349
Anyways, but this is what I found.

385
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,420
Remember that?

386
00:31:12,021 --> 00:31:14,022
It's the brochure
from that land deal

387
00:31:14,023 --> 00:31:16,728
your sister wanted us
to get into... in Idaho.

388
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,964
Remember that sheriff that
kept trying to hire me?

389
00:31:22,965 --> 00:31:26,234
He thought, uh, that
rusted pickup truck

390
00:31:26,235 --> 00:31:28,238
was a selling point?

391
00:31:39,415 --> 00:31:41,318
Should've taken the job.

392
00:31:44,721 --> 00:31:48,160
I am angry all the time now, Sams.

393
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,832
I just can't let go of
shit anymore, you know?

394
00:31:56,098 --> 00:31:58,302
I just can't breathe.

395
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:18,687
So?

396
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,789
Well, I checked this guy
out on the internet.

397
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,626
Booyah. His parents
have a dry-cleaners,

398
00:32:23,627 --> 00:32:26,896
and he also has a very
pretty little sister.

399
00:32:26,897 --> 00:32:28,697
I think it's time to scale up.

400
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:31,870
We're like rats, living
off scraps for too long.

401
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:35,405
Burn it.

402
00:32:36,773 --> 00:32:38,373
And them.

403
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,344
Whew.

404
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:42,779
That's a lot of heat.

405
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:50,819
Who runs it?

406
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,621
- I don't know nothing.
- Hey, what's up, tweety?

407
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:53,957
Yeah, forget you, slick.

408
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:56,926
- Hey, boss.
- Hey, Gut.

409
00:32:56,927 --> 00:32:58,560
What's all this?

410
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:00,361
You need something in particular?

411
00:33:00,362 --> 00:33:03,000
Hotel manager said he slept
through the whole thing.

412
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:05,199
Yeah.

413
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,005
It looks like the only
loose end we got is, uh...

414
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:10,773
the soldier you interviewed.

415
00:33:10,774 --> 00:33:13,441
John... John Nu...

416
00:33:13,442 --> 00:33:15,911
- Nguyen.
- Nguyen.

417
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:18,316
Checked his alibi. He's solid.

418
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:21,750
Well, it looks like
we're at a dead end.

419
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:24,419
That's why it's called
an investigation.

420
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,421
Treat it like a homicide.
Work the facts.

421
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:28,025
I'll see you later.

422
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:38,366
- Whoo!
- Get your ass out of here.

423
00:33:38,367 --> 00:33:39,570
Go!

424
00:33:52,749 --> 00:33:54,117
Go left!

425
00:33:59,254 --> 00:34:00,422
Shut the fuck up!

426
00:34:08,197 --> 00:34:09,665
Shut up!

427
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:12,003
Shut that little Chink up.
Let's go!

428
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,107
- God damn it!
- Ming, Ming!

429
00:34:19,108 --> 00:34:20,176
Pick her up!

430
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:23,814
Come here, Mama.

431
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,282
Shut her up.

432
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:29,819
Shut up, old man.

433
00:34:31,353 --> 00:34:33,123
Let's go, man, let's go.

434
00:34:35,124 --> 00:34:36,192
Shut up!

435
00:34:39,763 --> 00:34:40,998
Get in there.

436
00:34:45,134 --> 00:34:48,139
- Get in there.
- Get in there, Mama.

437
00:34:50,105 --> 00:34:51,173
Pipe down, all right?

438
00:34:54,544 --> 00:34:56,110
- Shut the fuck...
- Come on, drive!

439
00:34:56,111 --> 00:34:57,513
That's what I'm talkin' about.

440
00:35:00,282 --> 00:35:02,252
Spread that bitch's legs.

441
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:05,587
Hold that little fucker down.

442
00:35:05,588 --> 00:35:07,689
- Fuckin' hold her down.
- God damn it.

443
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,294
Look at me, you little slut.

444
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:13,429
Yeah.

445
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,433
Yeah. Take that shit.

446
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:19,835
Little fuckin' Chink slut.

447
00:35:19,836 --> 00:35:21,371
Come on.

448
00:35:22,304 --> 00:35:23,439
Yeah.

449
00:35:25,174 --> 00:35:26,944
Drown her ass.

450
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:35,153
Boys, run like fuck.

451
00:35:49,032 --> 00:35:50,935
Is it them?

452
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:54,168
Jesus.

453
00:35:54,169 --> 00:35:57,205
All right, we'll call
that a positive ID.

454
00:35:57,206 --> 00:36:00,880
Ho, Ming, and Daniel Nguyen.

455
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:08,249
So, John, what happened

456
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,953
in that motel?

457
00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:12,254
What?

458
00:36:13,222 --> 00:36:15,356
Come on, I'm not stupid.

459
00:36:15,357 --> 00:36:18,192
I don't believe in coincidences.

460
00:36:18,193 --> 00:36:20,062
Who did this?

461
00:36:20,063 --> 00:36:21,897
If I knew,

462
00:36:21,898 --> 00:36:24,633
I wouldn't be standing here.

463
00:36:24,634 --> 00:36:26,434
Yeah.

464
00:36:26,435 --> 00:36:28,537
But you know something.

465
00:36:28,538 --> 00:36:30,539
Like what?

466
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,541
Like what kind of shit
are you mixed up in?

467
00:36:32,542 --> 00:36:34,846
Who'd have a reason to
do something like this?

468
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,447
What makes you think I know?

469
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:42,855
That look on your face,
your reaction.

470
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:46,955
You think this is the first time
I've seen a burned body?

471
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:49,527
No. But this is your family.

472
00:36:54,597 --> 00:36:57,099
Where were you night before last?

473
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,934
At my friend's place.

474
00:36:58,935 --> 00:37:00,469
Had a couple of drinks,

475
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,141
couldn't drive. I told you.

476
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:06,508
Am I a suspect?

477
00:37:06,509 --> 00:37:08,211
No, not yet.

478
00:37:09,512 --> 00:37:12,316
Don't walk away, John.
I'm trying to help you here.

479
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:17,121
Help?

480
00:37:18,087 --> 00:37:19,790
What help can you give me?

481
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,031
Come on, kid. You
gotta talk to me.

482
00:37:27,163 --> 00:37:28,497
Johnny, come on.

483
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:30,233
Hid!

484
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:39,074
I need to use your dad's workbench.

485
00:37:39,075 --> 00:37:40,842
I need his shotgun too.

486
00:37:40,843 --> 00:37:43,748
John, get a grip. This ain't
the time to do dumbass shit.

487
00:37:48,885 --> 00:37:51,790
You need to step off and
think right now, John.

488
00:37:54,524 --> 00:37:58,026
You got cops here. Real cops
that do their shit right.

489
00:37:58,027 --> 00:38:00,162
Let them find these motherfuckers.

490
00:38:00,163 --> 00:38:02,296
We need to go and
tell them the truth.

491
00:38:02,297 --> 00:38:04,267
I need that shotgun.

492
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,708
That ain't gonna bring 'em back.

493
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,476
What do you think I'm gonna do?

494
00:38:14,477 --> 00:38:15,912
File a fucking report?

495
00:38:47,277 --> 00:38:49,247
Oh yeah.

496
00:38:58,688 --> 00:38:59,990
Hey!

497
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:04,295
Ow ow!

498
00:39:06,229 --> 00:39:08,096
That's my dick!

499
00:39:08,097 --> 00:39:09,667
- Shut up.
- Ow!

500
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:12,534
Get up.

501
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:16,575
Let go, please please!

502
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,148
When they came for him...

503
00:39:26,149 --> 00:39:28,854
Hey, sarge. How's your wife?

504
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,754
Good. Uh... so.

505
00:39:32,755 --> 00:39:35,090
Dispatch says we got a kidnapping.

506
00:39:35,091 --> 00:39:38,093
Yeah, Carl Schlinger.
He's the manager here.

507
00:39:38,094 --> 00:39:40,962
- What a shithole.
- Yeah.

508
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:42,464
They'll burn a family alive,

509
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:44,499
but can't drop a match
in this fucking place?

510
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,535
- Yeah.
- No kidding.

511
00:39:46,536 --> 00:39:49,137
Looks like the intruder blasted
his way right in here.

512
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:51,173
Clever son of a bitch
loaded a 12-gauge shell up

513
00:39:51,174 --> 00:39:53,544
with nickels... he hammered
right through the lock.

514
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:57,512
- That's an IED.
- Yeah.

515
00:39:57,513 --> 00:39:59,449
Expensive shot.

516
00:40:02,585 --> 00:40:05,554
Hey! Hey hey hey.

517
00:40:05,555 --> 00:40:08,890
I'll do... I didn't do it.
No, why did you shoot me?

518
00:40:08,891 --> 00:40:10,159
Don't shoot.

519
00:40:11,393 --> 00:40:13,762
I didn't do nothing. I... all right!

520
00:40:13,763 --> 00:40:15,364
I didn't...

521
00:40:15,365 --> 00:40:17,032
anyone there?

522
00:40:17,033 --> 00:40:19,801
Bet you shit when the
gun went off, huh?

523
00:40:19,802 --> 00:40:22,371
Looks like he, uh, caught
up with our man here

524
00:40:22,372 --> 00:40:25,807
while he was watching TV...
homemade kiddie porn.

525
00:40:25,808 --> 00:40:27,376
Little boy, about eight.

526
00:40:27,377 --> 00:40:29,478
That's some fucked-up
shit you watch.

527
00:40:29,479 --> 00:40:31,780
- You in some kind of club?
- No no no, no.

528
00:40:31,781 --> 00:40:33,949
I-I... I got a friend.

529
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,151
He's in Memphis.

530
00:40:36,152 --> 00:40:39,054
And he just sends it to me, man.
I say, I don't pay for this.

531
00:40:39,055 --> 00:40:41,189
I don't. It's just... it's just...

532
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:44,025
- Just like that, he sends it to you?
- Yeah.

533
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:45,861
Or do you fucking order it?

534
00:40:45,862 --> 00:40:48,163
No no no. I know it's wrong.

535
00:40:48,164 --> 00:40:50,132
And I'm sorry. It's just that I...

536
00:40:50,133 --> 00:40:51,733
I got a problem.

537
00:40:51,734 --> 00:40:53,502
I do and I'm sorry. I said that.

538
00:40:53,503 --> 00:40:56,474
I just... I don't understand.
It's just porn.

539
00:40:58,408 --> 00:41:00,542
- What's that? Crystal?
- Salt.

540
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:03,044
- Salt?
- Yeah, best I can figure is

541
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:05,847
the perp busted down the
door with the nickels.

542
00:41:05,848 --> 00:41:08,350
Bang, hit Schlinger
with another shot.

543
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:10,819
This whole thing is
loaded with rock salt.

544
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,321
The shit went right
through the cushions.

545
00:41:13,322 --> 00:41:15,457
All right, so our guy's got a plan.

546
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:18,260
Comes in, specialized
round for the door,

547
00:41:18,261 --> 00:41:20,996
specialized round for the target.

548
00:41:20,997 --> 00:41:24,369
John, what the fuck, man?

549
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:27,903
Are you lost your mind?

550
00:41:27,904 --> 00:41:29,974
I didn't do nothing to you.

551
00:41:30,973 --> 00:41:33,308
What the fuck are you doing, man?

552
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:35,610
I mean, what is this about?
Why you got me tied up?

553
00:41:35,611 --> 00:41:38,079
Why'd you fuckin' shoot me, man?

554
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,948
That shit in the parking lot.

555
00:41:39,949 --> 00:41:41,483
Who came looking for me?

556
00:41:41,484 --> 00:41:42,951
I... I didn't say nothing.

557
00:41:42,952 --> 00:41:45,620
I swear to God. I didn't
say nothing, John.

558
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:47,389
- Fucking more salt?
- No!

559
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,391
- Oh yeah.
- Come on, man. What the fuck is this?

560
00:41:49,392 --> 00:41:51,226
I don't get it.

561
00:41:51,227 --> 00:41:53,228
The old lady across the
street says she sees

562
00:41:53,229 --> 00:41:56,565
one man carry another one out,
dump him in a car, drive off.

563
00:41:56,566 --> 00:41:58,533
- So we got a witness?
- No.

564
00:41:58,534 --> 00:42:00,035
Couldn't see the perp.

565
00:42:00,036 --> 00:42:02,871
His face was concealed
by Schlinger.

566
00:42:02,872 --> 00:42:04,806
Fireman's carry.

567
00:42:04,807 --> 00:42:07,209
- Did she see a car?
- Car?

568
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:10,449
Get this: "something gray."

569
00:42:12,248 --> 00:42:14,950
- Yeah.
- Jesus.

570
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:17,487
- That guy you told about me?
- Uh-huh?

571
00:42:17,488 --> 00:42:19,154
He's a serious guy, huh?

572
00:42:19,155 --> 00:42:21,823
- You wanna know what he did, Carl?
- No.

573
00:42:21,824 --> 00:42:23,794
No, I don't.

574
00:42:27,263 --> 00:42:29,231
He burned my family alive.

575
00:42:29,232 --> 00:42:30,866
Oh, I didn't... I don't know, John.

576
00:42:30,867 --> 00:42:32,667
I swear, I had nothing
to do with it.

577
00:42:32,668 --> 00:42:34,805
Who the fuck is this guy?

578
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,277
I can't!

579
00:42:42,278 --> 00:42:44,613
Shit.

580
00:42:44,614 --> 00:42:47,782
God damn it.

581
00:42:47,783 --> 00:42:50,986
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

582
00:42:50,987 --> 00:42:53,989
You don't know this motherfucker!

583
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,459
He doesn't fucking know me!

584
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,797
And neither do you!

585
00:43:02,198 --> 00:43:03,698
Okay okay.

586
00:43:03,699 --> 00:43:06,170
Okay okay. Listen...

587
00:43:07,471 --> 00:43:10,138
His name's H-H-Hollis.

588
00:43:10,139 --> 00:43:12,207
He's Mr. Hollis.

589
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:13,608
Where do I find him?

590
00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:15,710
I don't know! Okay?

591
00:43:15,711 --> 00:43:17,045
He... he finds you.

592
00:43:17,046 --> 00:43:18,847
That's how this thing works, man.

593
00:43:18,848 --> 00:43:21,750
And I'm gonna tell you something:
this guy is white-hot.

594
00:43:21,751 --> 00:43:22,984
He's fucking wood, man.

595
00:43:22,985 --> 00:43:25,153
He's prison shit, jailhouse shit.

596
00:43:25,154 --> 00:43:28,323
He's hard as a rock, man. This
motherfucker don't fuck around.

597
00:43:28,324 --> 00:43:31,593
You feeling me on this?
Yeah, he don't fuck around.

598
00:43:31,594 --> 00:43:33,795
You think I would take
this shit from this guy

599
00:43:33,796 --> 00:43:36,231
if he fucked around? Huh?

600
00:43:36,232 --> 00:43:38,133
Tell me more.

601
00:43:38,134 --> 00:43:40,168
He's into everything. Whores...

602
00:43:40,169 --> 00:43:42,938
hookers, drugs, guns...

603
00:43:42,939 --> 00:43:44,639
everything.

604
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,274
- That girl.
- What girl?

605
00:43:46,275 --> 00:43:48,009
That I see around a lot.

606
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:49,744
Tanya? That bitch?

607
00:43:49,745 --> 00:43:52,080
- She part of his crew?
- Yeah, goddamn right she's part...

608
00:43:52,081 --> 00:43:53,748
he owns that ho.

609
00:43:53,749 --> 00:43:55,817
Listen, fuck all that.

610
00:43:55,818 --> 00:43:57,852
Listen, John, I swear to God,

611
00:43:57,853 --> 00:43:59,988
I didn't... I didn't know

612
00:43:59,989 --> 00:44:02,090
that they would hurt your family.

613
00:44:02,091 --> 00:44:04,228
Please, man, I didn't know.

614
00:44:08,297 --> 00:44:09,764
You get high?

615
00:44:09,765 --> 00:44:12,535
Sss... yeah, I mean...

616
00:44:12,536 --> 00:44:14,269
- His drugs?
- No!

617
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:16,608
H-his dealer.

618
00:44:18,107 --> 00:44:19,743
Let's get high.

619
00:44:23,713 --> 00:44:25,315
Oh shit.

620
00:44:32,021 --> 00:44:33,691
Shit.

621
00:44:45,535 --> 00:44:47,270
Magic man.

622
00:44:48,938 --> 00:44:50,105
How are you, man?

623
00:44:50,106 --> 00:44:52,273
You snuck up on me, man,
motherfucker.

624
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:53,844
You keeping my seat warm?

625
00:44:54,777 --> 00:44:56,079
Come on in.

626
00:44:58,848 --> 00:45:01,282
So you in business with Hollis now.

627
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:03,453
So are you.

628
00:45:04,488 --> 00:45:06,287
That's a bad habit.

629
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:09,024
And I don't allow
smoking in my car.

630
00:45:09,025 --> 00:45:11,693
Oh, it's your car now.

631
00:45:11,694 --> 00:45:15,363
Well, I just deposited
200 Gs on the backseat

632
00:45:15,364 --> 00:45:17,432
for the drugs in the trunk.

633
00:45:17,433 --> 00:45:19,671
So, yeah, I think
that makes it mine.

634
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:26,012
There are no drugs in
the trunk, Inglaterra.

635
00:45:28,244 --> 00:45:31,416
Did I ever tell you I had
a cat named Magic once?

636
00:45:32,582 --> 00:45:35,153
And it was a pussy
too, just like you.

637
00:45:37,153 --> 00:45:40,121
Maybe you don't
understand American.

638
00:45:40,122 --> 00:45:42,492
I'm the last thing you're
ever going to see.

639
00:45:43,694 --> 00:45:45,429
Well, that's depressing.

640
00:45:47,464 --> 00:45:49,532
I'm going to keep the money.

641
00:45:49,533 --> 00:45:51,467
Yeah.

642
00:45:51,468 --> 00:45:53,304
How you feel me now?

643
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:55,604
About that.

644
00:45:55,605 --> 00:45:57,606
Whoa, easy easy. Cálmate, bro.

645
00:45:57,607 --> 00:46:00,008
Now I'll put that
down to stupidity.

646
00:46:00,009 --> 00:46:02,712
Now, you listen and
you listen good.

647
00:46:02,713 --> 00:46:04,379
You back off.

648
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,549
And you start walking
down that street.

649
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,316
Okay, cálmate, cálmate, brother.

650
00:46:08,317 --> 00:46:11,523
Yo yo, I was just... I was just
playing with you, man. Fuck.

651
00:46:14,624 --> 00:46:16,124
Easy easy, okay?

652
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:18,162
We still friends?

653
00:46:19,261 --> 00:46:20,797
All right.

654
00:46:21,732 --> 00:46:22,764
I'll catch you on the flipside.

655
00:46:22,765 --> 00:46:24,966
Yeah, you will, yeah.

656
00:46:24,967 --> 00:46:26,602
You've just broken a deal.

657
00:46:26,603 --> 00:46:28,537
I'm taking me business elsewhere!

658
00:46:28,538 --> 00:46:29,940
Bang, motherfucker.

659
00:46:57,333 --> 00:46:59,167
Let's go.

660
00:46:59,168 --> 00:47:00,902
- Ow, my... aah! Ow, yo yo.
- Shh.

661
00:47:00,903 --> 00:47:02,706
Close the door. Close the door.

662
00:47:05,509 --> 00:47:07,976
You'll let me go after this, right?
If I do you right?

663
00:47:07,977 --> 00:47:10,780
Maybe your friend might have
some fucking painkillers too.

664
00:47:10,781 --> 00:47:12,548
Oh, this motherfucker
got everything.

665
00:47:12,549 --> 00:47:14,318
Man, that shit hurt, man.

666
00:47:16,051 --> 00:47:18,388
You shot me in my nuts, man.

667
00:47:22,858 --> 00:47:24,795
Motherfuck.

668
00:47:34,471 --> 00:47:36,273
Hey.

669
00:47:51,153 --> 00:47:53,023
- What's up?
- Hey.

670
00:47:54,156 --> 00:47:55,724
You're supposed to, um,

671
00:47:55,725 --> 00:47:57,392
call before you roll up here.

672
00:47:57,393 --> 00:47:59,495
Yeah, don't worry, man.
I forgot, okay?

673
00:47:59,496 --> 00:48:02,096
- I was in the neighborhood.
- What the fuck happened to your...

674
00:48:02,097 --> 00:48:04,432
to your shit? What's there
to dig? What's that?

675
00:48:04,433 --> 00:48:06,901
I got bit, man, by a
motherfucking Rottweiler.

676
00:48:06,902 --> 00:48:08,571
It tore my shit up.

677
00:48:08,572 --> 00:48:09,871
Who the fuck is that guy?

678
00:48:09,872 --> 00:48:11,441
He wanna party.

679
00:48:13,209 --> 00:48:16,679
Oh, well, shit, that's
the fuckin' password.

680
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,346
- Yeah.
- All right.

681
00:48:18,347 --> 00:48:21,282
- How you been, man?
- Good, I've been good.

682
00:48:21,283 --> 00:48:23,786
Don't y'all niggas
get too comfortable.

683
00:48:23,787 --> 00:48:25,857
I wanna make this a drive-thru.

684
00:48:28,725 --> 00:48:31,460
Get the fuck out of here
with that nonsense.

685
00:48:31,461 --> 00:48:33,330
- Get on your knees.
- Eat my ass.

686
00:48:36,633 --> 00:48:37,800
- Get over here.
- I am!

687
00:48:37,801 --> 00:48:39,367
Face the fucking wall.

688
00:48:39,368 --> 00:48:41,102
Put this shit on him now.

689
00:48:41,103 --> 00:48:44,339
- Nice and tight.
- Put your hands behind you.

690
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,941
Come on, man. This
motherfucker's crazy.

691
00:48:46,942 --> 00:48:48,644
Give me your other hand.

692
00:48:48,645 --> 00:48:50,144
Dawg, I didn't do
this shit, all right?

693
00:48:50,145 --> 00:48:51,881
- I didn't do this...
- Fuck off.

694
00:48:51,882 --> 00:48:53,682
- You, get over there.
- What?

695
00:48:53,683 --> 00:48:54,717
- I thought I was done!
- On your knees.

696
00:48:54,718 --> 00:48:56,017
Shut up, get on your knees.

697
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:57,554
This is fucked up.

698
00:48:59,355 --> 00:49:01,258
- I can't deal with...
- Shh.

699
00:49:02,391 --> 00:49:04,460
Please... not cool.

700
00:49:04,461 --> 00:49:06,862
Aw shit.

701
00:49:06,863 --> 00:49:08,464
Anyone else in here?

702
00:49:08,465 --> 00:49:10,198
Nah, your mama just left.

703
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:11,902
Shut the fuck up.

704
00:49:20,009 --> 00:49:21,311
Oh my God...

705
00:49:23,012 --> 00:49:24,949
Motherfucker, what's
wrong with you?

706
00:49:48,337 --> 00:49:50,541
- Fucking quiet out here...
- Hey!

707
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:11,729
Oh shit!

708
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:36,954
Who are you?

709
00:50:42,792 --> 00:50:44,729
Listen, man.

710
00:50:46,496 --> 00:50:49,565
The gear's in the back of the
car, if that's what you're after.

711
00:50:49,566 --> 00:50:51,435
Name?

712
00:50:52,434 --> 00:50:55,106
Oh, do you want my
phone number as well?

713
00:50:56,706 --> 00:51:00,141
A lot of guys think that
the Iraqis are dumb.

714
00:51:00,142 --> 00:51:03,012
I mean, half of them don't
even have fucking toilets.

715
00:51:03,013 --> 00:51:05,952
Wipe their asses with their hands.

716
00:51:07,851 --> 00:51:10,019
You ever heard of
the Ba'ath party?

717
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:13,154
No, but I could do
with one right now.

718
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:15,557
The Ba'ath party uses torture

719
00:51:15,558 --> 00:51:18,162
like some kind of game.

720
00:51:23,198 --> 00:51:24,933
We found this tape

721
00:51:24,934 --> 00:51:27,870
with some of their interrogation.

722
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,974
Shit was fucked up.

723
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,274
What's your problem?

724
00:51:33,275 --> 00:51:34,777
Just tell me.

725
00:51:34,778 --> 00:51:36,512
When I hit you with
this electricity,

726
00:51:36,513 --> 00:51:38,881
all your muscles and ligaments

727
00:51:38,882 --> 00:51:40,816
will pop.

728
00:51:40,817 --> 00:51:43,217
And you're gonna burn
from the inside out.

729
00:51:43,218 --> 00:51:46,323
Almost forgot. Come on.

730
00:51:49,759 --> 00:51:52,664
Don't want you to bite off
your tongue, now, do we?

731
00:52:15,852 --> 00:52:17,251
Who's Hollis?

732
00:52:17,252 --> 00:52:20,022
He's a cunt.

733
00:52:20,023 --> 00:52:21,557
- So you do know him?
- Yes!

734
00:52:21,558 --> 00:52:24,095
I fucking know him!

735
00:52:25,194 --> 00:52:26,662
How do I get to him?

736
00:52:26,663 --> 00:52:29,098
You get in line.

737
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:32,004
Listen, why is this
so fucking personal?

738
00:52:34,671 --> 00:52:37,008
It's as personal as it gets.

739
00:52:43,445 --> 00:52:45,783
Family.

740
00:52:48,718 --> 00:52:50,755
It was your family, wasn't it?

741
00:52:53,456 --> 00:52:55,325
Listen, man.

742
00:52:56,593 --> 00:52:58,627
I had nothing to do with it.

743
00:52:58,628 --> 00:53:00,596
I'm sorry for that shit.

744
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:02,531
Just tell me... what
do I have to do

745
00:53:02,532 --> 00:53:04,133
to walk out of here?

746
00:53:04,134 --> 00:53:06,104
What do you have to sell?

747
00:53:07,436 --> 00:53:11,039
All I know is he's got a big
meth lab on the east side.

748
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,274
He cooks his shit up
there 24 hours a day.

749
00:53:13,275 --> 00:53:16,812
- And?
- And if you wanna hurt him real bad,

750
00:53:16,813 --> 00:53:18,015
you hit his wallet.

751
00:53:19,649 --> 00:53:21,853
That's all I fucking got.

752
00:53:22,785 --> 00:53:26,491
Come on. Come on.

753
00:53:32,194 --> 00:53:33,597
Fuck.

754
00:53:47,544 --> 00:53:49,945
- Hey, Carl.
- What?!

755
00:53:49,946 --> 00:53:51,847
Got some painkillers for you.

756
00:53:51,848 --> 00:53:54,149
Oh shit, thank you. Thank you.

757
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:57,318
- I'm hurting, man. I'm fucking hurting.
- Oxy-codeine or something?

758
00:53:57,319 --> 00:54:00,956
No, that's... oh shit shit,
that's Oxycontin, nigga.

759
00:54:00,957 --> 00:54:02,925
Give me some of that shit.

760
00:54:02,926 --> 00:54:05,994
That shit hurt me. I didn't mean
to put you on Front Street...

761
00:54:05,995 --> 00:54:08,096
Take one for the pain,
man. Here here.

762
00:54:08,097 --> 00:54:10,132
Thank you.

763
00:54:10,133 --> 00:54:11,332
Hey, I...

764
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:13,202
Okay.

765
00:54:13,203 --> 00:54:15,704
- How about one for that shin, huh?
- Yeah.

766
00:54:15,705 --> 00:54:17,338
Yeah yeah,

767
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:19,442
- because...
- Open it up now. There we go.

768
00:54:20,375 --> 00:54:22,044
I can leave? We cool, right?

769
00:54:22,045 --> 00:54:24,378
I-I mean, I didn't do
what these motherfuckers

770
00:54:24,379 --> 00:54:26,782
did to you. I just
talked a little bit.

771
00:54:26,783 --> 00:54:28,884
How about one more? Just
for all the pain and shit?

772
00:54:28,885 --> 00:54:30,185
- That's a little much, man.
- Huh?

773
00:54:30,186 --> 00:54:32,557
- I...
- Come on.

774
00:54:47,036 --> 00:54:49,406
That one's for the
boy in the video.

775
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:07,321
How'd it go last night?

776
00:55:07,322 --> 00:55:10,259
Look, Hollis, I don't know
how to tell you this, but...

777
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,928
I just don't know if I'm
up for this shite anymore.

778
00:55:12,929 --> 00:55:14,563
What do you mean?

779
00:55:14,564 --> 00:55:16,932
You know, the murders, like,

780
00:55:16,933 --> 00:55:18,667
burning people, I just...

781
00:55:18,668 --> 00:55:21,305
I don't know if I've got
it in me still, you know?

782
00:55:35,785 --> 00:55:37,152
Yeah?

783
00:55:37,153 --> 00:55:39,420
- Hollis, listen to this.
- What?

784
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:41,790
You know that pervert
you keep at the hotel?

785
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:45,060
He fucking kidnapped him
or something. I don't know.

786
00:55:45,061 --> 00:55:48,267
- Son of a bitch.
- Who was that?

787
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,566
It's that guy I told you about.

788
00:55:51,567 --> 00:55:52,934
Yeah? And what?

789
00:55:52,935 --> 00:55:55,369
Yeah, the Chink... Nguyen.

790
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:56,639
Oh fuck!

791
00:55:58,574 --> 00:56:00,075
- What's happening?
- He kidnapped the pervert

792
00:56:00,076 --> 00:56:02,311
- I keep at the hotel.
- But why?

793
00:56:02,312 --> 00:56:04,880
I think to find out who
toasted his family.

794
00:56:04,881 --> 00:56:07,649
I don't need you getting
soft on me now.

795
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:09,417
I need you on this,

796
00:56:09,418 --> 00:56:11,556
- 100%.
- All right.

797
00:56:12,555 --> 00:56:14,523
100%.

798
00:56:14,524 --> 00:56:15,926
All right.

799
00:56:38,781 --> 00:56:41,686
- What do you got?
- About 45¢ so far.

800
00:56:43,353 --> 00:56:45,020
Who's the dead guy?

801
00:56:45,021 --> 00:56:46,555
Guys, plural.

802
00:56:46,556 --> 00:56:48,957
Lionel Murray, aka Dent,

803
00:56:48,958 --> 00:56:50,959
and our favorite
missing pederast...

804
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,928
Carl Schlinger.

805
00:56:52,929 --> 00:56:54,364
No shit?

806
00:56:55,298 --> 00:56:56,832
Got a COD?

807
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:59,901
Somebody forced him to swallow
about 20 Oxycontin tabs.

808
00:56:59,902 --> 00:57:01,770
That'll do it.

809
00:57:01,771 --> 00:57:03,805
Murray's got about
half his head left.

810
00:57:03,806 --> 00:57:06,141
And then Schlinger...

811
00:57:06,142 --> 00:57:07,709
zip-tied, trussed up,

812
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:09,443
injuries prior to death.

813
00:57:09,444 --> 00:57:11,213
Yeah?

814
00:57:11,214 --> 00:57:13,515
Salt blasted into his
groin, his penis,

815
00:57:13,516 --> 00:57:16,118
his shit. Oh man.

816
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:17,819
He shot him in the fucking balls?

817
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,690
Fucking poetic.

818
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:23,925
But we still have a murder and
kidnapping suspect out there.

819
00:57:23,926 --> 00:57:26,395
You know, I think it's time we...

820
00:57:26,396 --> 00:57:28,463
make him an official suspect.

821
00:57:28,464 --> 00:57:31,633
Why? Because of a bag of nickels?

822
00:57:31,634 --> 00:57:33,303
Well, you know it's him.

823
00:57:34,704 --> 00:57:36,171
No shit.

824
00:57:36,172 --> 00:57:38,840
- It's a theory.
- Well, so's evolution,

825
00:57:38,841 --> 00:57:41,109
but I don't know a
better one out there.

826
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:43,715
Evidence, Mark, let's
just get some evidence.

827
00:57:54,323 --> 00:57:56,258
Don't be daft, girl.

828
00:57:56,259 --> 00:57:58,764
I'm not here to hurt you.

829
00:58:02,098 --> 00:58:03,598
Let's get you washed up.

830
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:05,700
Come on. Come on.

831
00:58:05,701 --> 00:58:06,869
Come on.

832
00:58:08,037 --> 00:58:09,339
Come on.

833
00:58:13,843 --> 00:58:15,811
Fucking monsters.

834
00:58:15,812 --> 00:58:17,481
It's okay.

835
00:58:28,257 --> 00:58:30,260
It's gonna be okay.

836
00:58:31,194 --> 00:58:33,264
I'm gonna get you out of here.

837
00:59:20,276 --> 00:59:22,012
Hey.

838
00:59:22,945 --> 00:59:24,279
Oh.

839
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,182
I've been on the phone
with DC since 6:00.

840
00:59:27,183 --> 00:59:29,452
- Why DC?
- John Nguyen.

841
00:59:29,453 --> 00:59:31,653
It turns out he was a green beret.

842
00:59:31,654 --> 00:59:34,422
He's got a list of
medals half a page long.

843
00:59:34,423 --> 00:59:37,359
And check this out.

844
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,397
He's famous.

845
00:59:40,997 --> 00:59:43,902
- What am I watching?
- Just wait for it.

846
00:59:50,139 --> 00:59:52,009
Motherfucker.

847
01:00:07,290 --> 01:00:09,391
Pentagon confirms it's him.

848
01:00:09,392 --> 01:00:11,460
Honorable discharge.

849
01:00:11,461 --> 01:00:14,296
Serious medical file.

850
01:00:14,297 --> 01:00:16,566
Apparently being a guest of
the Taliban for a few weeks

851
01:00:16,567 --> 01:00:18,536
seriously messed up this guy.

852
01:00:20,803 --> 01:00:23,605
Show some respect.
He's a decorated veteran.

853
01:00:23,606 --> 01:00:26,441
Hey hey, look, that doesn't
make him innocent.

854
01:00:26,442 --> 01:00:28,176
Okay? We got means,

855
01:00:28,177 --> 01:00:30,679
we got motive and opportunity.

856
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,915
Then why Schlinger? Why Dent?

857
01:00:33,916 --> 01:00:36,017
What's the connection between them

858
01:00:36,018 --> 01:00:37,919
and a couple of Aryan brother types

859
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,721
found dead in the
motel parking lot?

860
01:00:39,722 --> 01:00:42,357
I don't know. Maybe this is the
tip of the shitberg or something.

861
01:00:42,358 --> 01:00:44,228
Maybe he's working his
way up the ladder.

862
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,929
All right, then let's find
out who's on the ladder.

863
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:49,631
Start a board,

864
01:00:49,632 --> 01:00:51,700
connect the dots, start a web.

865
01:00:51,701 --> 01:00:53,536
So we're gonna put out an alert.

866
01:00:53,537 --> 01:00:55,103
Not yet.

867
01:00:55,104 --> 01:00:57,540
He's a suspect in four deaths.

868
01:00:57,541 --> 01:00:59,441
Yeah, and they probably
all earned it.

869
01:00:59,442 --> 01:01:02,043
They're probably the guys
that killed his family.

870
01:01:02,044 --> 01:01:04,846
And that's a fucking case we
haven't done shit on, isn't it?

871
01:01:04,847 --> 01:01:07,450
So we're just gonna let
him do our job for us?

872
01:01:07,451 --> 01:01:09,351
Why not?

873
01:01:09,352 --> 01:01:12,257
- He's more effective than we are.
- All right.

874
01:01:19,128 --> 01:01:22,197
Your president says America
is leaving Afghanistan.

875
01:01:22,198 --> 01:01:24,366
This is good.

876
01:01:24,367 --> 01:01:26,805
Afghanistan is not for you.

877
01:01:29,438 --> 01:01:31,406
Which of the villagers is
working with you, huh?

878
01:01:31,407 --> 01:01:33,942
Is it Abu Gadir? Is it Amir Gutz?

879
01:01:33,943 --> 01:01:35,611
Come on. You tell me.

880
01:01:35,612 --> 01:01:37,647
You will tell me everything.

881
01:01:37,648 --> 01:01:39,785
Tell me what I want to
know and you will go home.

882
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:16,619
- Yeah.
- Bennet, it's Vin.

883
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:19,354
Got some nervous people over here.

884
01:02:19,355 --> 01:02:22,658
Yeah, listen, I've dropped
Hollis's cash off with Goldie.

885
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:24,125
Whoa whoa whoa.

886
01:02:24,126 --> 01:02:25,528
What's going on, Bennet?

887
01:02:25,529 --> 01:02:27,862
Not enough money in the world.

888
01:02:27,863 --> 01:02:29,532
Talk to me, man.

889
01:02:29,533 --> 01:02:32,672
As I said, just take my
advice, make yourself scarce.

890
01:02:34,370 --> 01:02:36,472
I just can't do that.

891
01:02:36,473 --> 01:02:38,840
It's complicated, mate.

892
01:02:38,841 --> 01:02:41,810
Well, then I guess
this is goodbye, mate.

893
01:02:41,811 --> 01:02:43,845
Okay well,

894
01:02:43,846 --> 01:02:45,148
cheers.

895
01:02:46,449 --> 01:02:47,919
See ya soon.

896
01:04:15,572 --> 01:04:17,141
What the...?

897
01:05:54,103 --> 01:05:56,271
What do you want, fuckface? Huh?

898
01:05:56,272 --> 01:05:58,006
You want me to say
I'm fuckin' sorry?

899
01:05:58,007 --> 01:05:59,608
Is that what you want?

900
01:05:59,609 --> 01:06:01,679
Fuck! I'm sorry!

901
01:06:06,315 --> 01:06:08,352
Oh my God.

902
01:06:32,742 --> 01:06:33,810
Oh man.

903
01:06:37,246 --> 01:06:38,346
What the fuck?

904
01:06:38,347 --> 01:06:40,916
What are you doing?
Digging for gold or what?

905
01:06:40,917 --> 01:06:43,388
It'd be a lot easier if
it wasn't so damn small.

906
01:06:44,788 --> 01:06:46,789
That little bitch is dug in there.

907
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:49,090
- You want a swig of this?
- No. Just fuckin' focus.

908
01:06:49,091 --> 01:06:51,295
- Get that shit out of there.
- Give me a second.

909
01:06:54,631 --> 01:06:56,465
All right, try not to move.

910
01:06:56,466 --> 01:06:58,634
- Yeah, you're right.
- Brace yourself.

911
01:06:58,635 --> 01:07:00,672
- This might hurt a little bit.
- Okay.

912
01:07:04,106 --> 01:07:05,709
- Fuck.
- Oh!

913
01:07:07,009 --> 01:07:08,644
Oh, I got... I got that sucker.

914
01:07:08,645 --> 01:07:09,913
- I got it.
- Yeah?

915
01:07:13,583 --> 01:07:15,684
Oh, man, we gotta clean that up.

916
01:07:15,685 --> 01:07:17,553
Yeah, I need those painkillers.

917
01:07:17,554 --> 01:07:18,754
You're gonna need it

918
01:07:18,755 --> 01:07:20,489
- a little bit more after this.
- Oh fuck fuck fuck.

919
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:23,328
- All right, hold your breath.
- Motherfucker.

920
01:08:20,784 --> 01:08:23,288
Leave a message after
the fucking beep.

921
01:08:25,688 --> 01:08:26,789
Hollis.

922
01:08:27,991 --> 01:08:30,996
I think soldier boy's
hit our supply lines.

923
01:08:33,395 --> 01:08:35,232
It's deadly silent here.

924
01:09:35,424 --> 01:09:36,492
So...

925
01:09:38,427 --> 01:09:40,963
- I can't, man.
- Your mom can.

926
01:09:40,964 --> 01:09:42,898
And if she gets fired?

927
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:44,600
How's she gonna get fired?

928
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:47,401
It's the fucking DMV, retard.

929
01:09:47,402 --> 01:09:49,505
Dude, this is mad fucking illegal.

930
01:09:49,506 --> 01:09:50,739
And you're out there
killing motherfuckers.

931
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:52,273
Just get me the address.

932
01:09:52,274 --> 01:09:54,211
Dude, it's her job.

933
01:09:59,916 --> 01:10:01,817
It's my family.

934
01:10:01,818 --> 01:10:03,955
They burned them alive.

935
01:10:09,324 --> 01:10:12,193
It's fucked up, I know,

936
01:10:12,194 --> 01:10:14,997
but we can't keep doing this shit.

937
01:10:14,998 --> 01:10:16,999
You know what's fucked up?

938
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,301
The fact that you're not doing
everything that you could to help me.

939
01:10:20,302 --> 01:10:23,138
John, this is insane. This
is the real fucking world.

940
01:10:23,139 --> 01:10:25,807
- This ain't Afghanistan.
- What happened to you?

941
01:10:25,808 --> 01:10:28,178
You lose your leg and
your nutsack too?

942
01:10:29,145 --> 01:10:31,349
- Fuck you, man!
- Help me.

943
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:35,784
I'll get you your damn address.

944
01:10:35,785 --> 01:10:38,854
Forget the address!
Let's get these guys!

945
01:10:38,855 --> 01:10:42,124
What the fuck is my
handicapped ass gonna do?

946
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:44,459
What are you gonna do? Play games
for the rest of your life?

947
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:46,329
- What do you care?
- I care.

948
01:10:47,997 --> 01:10:49,631
And I only trust you.

949
01:10:49,632 --> 01:10:51,800
I'll get you the address,

950
01:10:51,801 --> 01:10:53,869
but why can't you understand

951
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:56,675
I ain't that fucking guy anymore?

952
01:11:02,277 --> 01:11:04,380
John.

953
01:11:09,886 --> 01:11:12,154
You'd really want me
to roll with you?

954
01:11:12,155 --> 01:11:13,958
Hell yeah.

955
01:11:16,859 --> 01:11:18,359
Give me an hour.

956
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,463
I'll get the address.

957
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,568
Angeles, take a walk around and
see what you can find, okay?

958
01:11:26,569 --> 01:11:28,171
Thanks, man.

959
01:11:31,708 --> 01:11:33,809
Protect and serve, my ass.

960
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:36,578
Just picking up the
pieces here, pal.

961
01:11:36,579 --> 01:11:38,446
This is a big lab.

962
01:11:38,447 --> 01:11:40,649
Somebody's gonna feel this.

963
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:42,851
Any idea who's running it?

964
01:11:42,852 --> 01:11:44,418
None.

965
01:11:44,419 --> 01:11:47,089
Still counting the bodies upstairs.

966
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:48,924
A fuckin' video game in there.

967
01:11:48,925 --> 01:11:51,295
Check this out. The one
outside, he was a lookout.

968
01:11:52,695 --> 01:11:55,497
Right through the back, into the
lungs, across the carotid...

969
01:11:55,498 --> 01:11:58,469
straight out of the Special Forces
hand-to-hand combat manual.

970
01:12:01,638 --> 01:12:03,572
Nguyen.

971
01:12:03,573 --> 01:12:05,643
Yeah, he's out of control.

972
01:12:06,843 --> 01:12:08,210
All right, put it out...

973
01:12:08,211 --> 01:12:09,578
name, description,

974
01:12:09,579 --> 01:12:11,546
last known location.

975
01:12:11,547 --> 01:12:12,682
Shit.

976
01:12:14,383 --> 01:12:17,351
Any luck with the known
associates for the motel guys?

977
01:12:17,352 --> 01:12:19,155
No. Not a thing.

978
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,726
- See you later.
- All right.

979
01:12:24,294 --> 01:12:26,766
Angel, over there. Yeah.

980
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,468
Hey.

981
01:12:33,435 --> 01:12:35,403
Look, I'm holding 'em
off as long as I can.

982
01:12:35,404 --> 01:12:36,938
What do you wanna hear from me?

983
01:12:36,939 --> 01:12:39,141
What do I wanna hear?

984
01:12:39,142 --> 01:12:41,710
I'll tell you what the
fuck I wanna hear.

985
01:12:41,711 --> 01:12:44,179
What I wanna hear is, "Thanks
for all the fucking money

986
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:45,947
you've been sending
my way, Hollis."

987
01:12:45,948 --> 01:12:48,416
That's what I wanna hear.
Don't tell me what you can't do.

988
01:12:48,417 --> 01:12:51,787
Look, who's the cop and
who's the felon here, okay?

989
01:12:51,788 --> 01:12:54,556
What, do you think I'm
gonna drop your money

990
01:12:54,557 --> 01:12:57,459
in my checking account
like some green asshole?

991
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:00,962
I can nail your ass any time
I want, okay? You savvy that?

992
01:13:00,963 --> 01:13:03,665
Okay, tell me what
you have in mind.

993
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:05,867
You want Nguyen.

994
01:13:05,868 --> 01:13:08,070
I need to solve a
triple murder, okay?

995
01:13:08,071 --> 01:13:10,843
I need names, I need
evidence. I need 'em all.

996
01:13:12,275 --> 01:13:13,809
Okay, I'll think about it.

997
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:16,011
This isn't a negotiation.

998
01:13:16,012 --> 01:13:19,382
Hey, Mark, say hi to Carol
and the kids for me.

999
01:14:20,009 --> 01:14:21,910
That's gonna leave a mark.

1000
01:14:21,911 --> 01:14:23,948
Taliban 101.

1001
01:14:30,753 --> 01:14:32,053
Wanna go get that?

1002
01:14:32,054 --> 01:14:34,556
I gotta pour wax over the
edges, seal this up.

1003
01:14:34,557 --> 01:14:36,927
All right, keep it quiet.

1004
01:14:40,096 --> 01:14:41,830
Hi, I'm Detective Mitchell.

1005
01:14:41,831 --> 01:14:44,166
Um, are you McIntyre?

1006
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:45,934
Jean Paul McIntyre?

1007
01:14:45,935 --> 01:14:47,836
Yes sir. Can I help you?

1008
01:14:47,837 --> 01:14:50,906
I got some questions
about John Nguyen.

1009
01:14:50,907 --> 01:14:52,908
He's a friend of yours, right?

1010
01:14:52,909 --> 01:14:55,010
Did you find out who
killed his family?

1011
01:14:55,011 --> 01:14:56,745
We're working on it.

1012
01:14:56,746 --> 01:14:59,581
Look, John has got himself

1013
01:14:59,582 --> 01:15:03,218
mixed up with some very
dangerous individuals.

1014
01:15:03,219 --> 01:15:04,953
Heh.

1015
01:15:04,954 --> 01:15:07,091
That's funny to you?

1016
01:15:08,324 --> 01:15:09,960
You ever been in combat?

1017
01:15:11,494 --> 01:15:13,798
This is what danger looks like.

1018
01:15:19,268 --> 01:15:21,069
Um, thank you for your service.

1019
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:24,306
I'm sorry about the leg, but
what the fuck is your point?

1020
01:15:24,307 --> 01:15:26,779
What would you do
if it was your family?

1021
01:15:29,545 --> 01:15:31,481
What is it with you guys?

1022
01:15:31,482 --> 01:15:34,583
I need information to do my job.

1023
01:15:34,584 --> 01:15:37,285
I can't help if you don't
tell me something.

1024
01:15:37,286 --> 01:15:39,022
Tell you something about what?

1025
01:15:43,326 --> 01:15:44,394
Excuse me.

1026
01:15:45,595 --> 01:15:46,663
Mitchell.

1027
01:15:57,740 --> 01:15:59,542
Yeah, I'll be right there.

1028
01:16:33,943 --> 01:16:35,679
You Mitchell?

1029
01:16:45,621 --> 01:16:48,560
I understand you're
looking for John Nguyen.

1030
01:16:50,693 --> 01:16:52,897
I was his CO.

1031
01:16:54,397 --> 01:16:57,002
So you understand,
I'm not here officially.

1032
01:16:59,635 --> 01:17:01,237
Roger that.

1033
01:17:02,705 --> 01:17:05,674
Army never should have let him out
in the world the way they did.

1034
01:17:05,675 --> 01:17:08,714
They treated him like
surplus equipment,

1035
01:17:09,979 --> 01:17:12,784
like a car more expensive
to repair than replace.

1036
01:17:15,418 --> 01:17:17,319
How you doing, Major?

1037
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:19,555
I ain't broken-down
enough yet, sir,

1038
01:17:19,556 --> 01:17:22,458
- so I'm doing just fine.
- Good.

1039
01:17:22,459 --> 01:17:25,393
Is there a particular reason

1040
01:17:25,394 --> 01:17:28,096
- you're here?
- You're gonna hunt him down.

1041
01:17:28,097 --> 01:17:30,765
That's what you do.
That's your function.

1042
01:17:30,766 --> 01:17:33,168
Before you do,

1043
01:17:33,169 --> 01:17:36,505
I thought you might like to
know in another time and place

1044
01:17:36,506 --> 01:17:38,974
you'd be thanking the Lord
Almighty Jesus Christ

1045
01:17:38,975 --> 01:17:40,578
he was on your side.

1046
01:17:41,744 --> 01:17:44,145
John was a born leader.

1047
01:17:44,146 --> 01:17:47,382
And he's a true killer. Cold
as fuck if you're down range.

1048
01:17:47,383 --> 01:17:49,552
But, man,

1049
01:17:49,553 --> 01:17:51,686
he'd take candy bars,

1050
01:17:51,687 --> 01:17:53,955
hand 'em out to little kids

1051
01:17:53,956 --> 01:17:56,024
just to see the look
on their faces.

1052
01:17:56,025 --> 01:17:58,527
Volunteer for vaccination details.

1053
01:17:58,528 --> 01:18:02,301
You just don't get many men like
that. You know this, Mr. Mitchell.

1054
01:18:03,766 --> 01:18:06,437
I just thought someone
should know who he was.

1055
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:09,106
You understand me?

1056
01:18:10,039 --> 01:18:12,407
I think someone out there

1057
01:18:12,408 --> 01:18:14,646
should know who he is.

1058
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,783
I'm sorry for your loss.

1059
01:18:22,118 --> 01:18:24,121
Hey, Griggs.

1060
01:18:25,489 --> 01:18:27,556
What's your recommendation?

1061
01:18:27,557 --> 01:18:29,891
I'd find the men who
killed his family

1062
01:18:29,892 --> 01:18:31,993
and I'd put 'em away.

1063
01:18:31,994 --> 01:18:35,030
Then I'd wait for John
to turn himself in,

1064
01:18:35,031 --> 01:18:36,666
because that's what he'll do.

1065
01:18:36,667 --> 01:18:38,767
He won't run from what he's done.

1066
01:18:38,768 --> 01:18:40,902
He's just not wired that way.

1067
01:18:40,903 --> 01:18:44,172
He believes in justice.

1068
01:18:44,173 --> 01:18:46,975
And if you can't
deliver it, well then,

1069
01:18:46,976 --> 01:18:49,948
you can be sure as hell John will.

1070
01:18:51,247 --> 01:18:53,652
Good day, Mr. Mitchell.

1071
01:19:09,031 --> 01:19:11,800
What you said really hurt, man,

1072
01:19:11,801 --> 01:19:14,272
but I needed to hear that shit.

1073
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,174
I haven't left this house in weeks.

1074
01:19:19,175 --> 01:19:21,776
Fuckin' weeks.

1075
01:19:21,777 --> 01:19:24,179
Every time I go out, some
motherfucker's gotta remind me

1076
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:26,515
I got my goddamn leg blown off.

1077
01:19:26,516 --> 01:19:28,083
"Oh, we're so proud of you."

1078
01:19:28,084 --> 01:19:30,619
"God bless you, you're so brave."

1079
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:33,556
I see those motherfuckers
eyeballing my prosthetic,

1080
01:19:33,557 --> 01:19:35,660
thinking, "This poor guy."

1081
01:19:37,661 --> 01:19:40,295
I've been home for over a year now,

1082
01:19:40,296 --> 01:19:42,964
just sitting around getting soft,

1083
01:19:42,965 --> 01:19:45,837
letting all that pity
make a bitch out of me.

1084
01:19:46,936 --> 01:19:48,837
But fuck that shit.

1085
01:19:48,838 --> 01:19:50,539
Let's do this.

1086
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:52,610
Let's fuckin' do this.

1087
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,092
- What you got?
- Got another baldy with an AH.

1088
01:20:08,324 --> 01:20:09,858
That makes 12.

1089
01:20:09,859 --> 01:20:11,962
Not including Hollis.

1090
01:20:19,001 --> 01:20:20,503
Get that gate.

1091
01:20:20,504 --> 01:20:22,173
Let's get this motherfucker.

1092
01:20:43,025 --> 01:20:44,795
Alone at last.

1093
01:20:45,796 --> 01:20:47,896
Thought you don't like used goods?

1094
01:20:47,897 --> 01:20:49,498
Well...

1095
01:20:49,499 --> 01:20:51,869
there's still a little juice
left in you, honey.

1096
01:20:54,069 --> 01:20:56,172
You just gotta know
how to squeeze.

1097
01:20:59,241 --> 01:21:00,577
Do whatever the fuck you want.

1098
01:21:03,179 --> 01:21:04,814
That's it, baby. Come on.

1099
01:21:04,815 --> 01:21:06,715
- Fuck fuck!
- That's it, baby.

1100
01:21:06,716 --> 01:21:08,285
- That's it.
- Hollis, stop!

1101
01:21:12,988 --> 01:21:14,456
- Fuck!
- Fight me, fight me.

1102
01:21:14,457 --> 01:21:15,825
Hollis, stop!

1103
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:18,993
Come on. That's it, bitch.

1104
01:21:18,994 --> 01:21:20,129
Fuck off.

1105
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:22,832
That's it, yeah.

1106
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:25,370
That's it. Yeah.

1107
01:21:29,305 --> 01:21:30,473
Hollis!

1108
01:21:32,975 --> 01:21:34,215
I thought I told you to go out.

1109
01:21:37,313 --> 01:21:38,883
Just tell me when.

1110
01:21:41,283 --> 01:21:42,786
You wanna do this?

1111
01:21:44,521 --> 01:21:46,755
Vin, who you kidding?

1112
01:21:46,756 --> 01:21:48,626
Three seconds.

1113
01:21:51,994 --> 01:21:54,097
Two, one.

1114
01:21:55,130 --> 01:21:56,198
Hit it.

1115
01:22:03,205 --> 01:22:04,707
Nice.

1116
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:06,341
Hey, what the fuck was that?

1117
01:22:06,342 --> 01:22:08,811
Don't kill 'em. Just wound 'em.

1118
01:22:08,812 --> 01:22:09,880
Got 'em.

1119
01:22:12,849 --> 01:22:15,316
Got another guy coming in.

1120
01:22:15,317 --> 01:22:16,752
Head shot. Head shot.

1121
01:22:16,753 --> 01:22:18,590
- Are you sure?
- Yup.

1122
01:22:21,357 --> 01:22:23,327
- Go!
- This is not over.

1123
01:22:24,994 --> 01:22:28,033
Bitch. I'm not done with you yet.

1124
01:22:39,942 --> 01:22:41,444
Stay down!

1125
01:22:43,178 --> 01:22:45,213
You two, out the back.

1126
01:22:45,214 --> 01:22:47,852
You two, by the side.

1127
01:22:50,854 --> 01:22:53,124
Put another one in him.

1128
01:22:55,190 --> 01:22:57,526
- I gotta help Marty.
- Forget Marty.

1129
01:22:57,527 --> 01:22:58,928
Hey... what do you mean,
"forget Marty"?

1130
01:22:58,929 --> 01:23:01,133
He's right here. He's
fuckin' dying, man.

1131
01:23:02,164 --> 01:23:03,398
Help!

1132
01:23:03,399 --> 01:23:04,600
- He's dead!
- Fuck it!

1133
01:23:04,601 --> 01:23:06,121
He isn't dead. What
do you mean he's...

1134
01:23:11,006 --> 01:23:13,007
If you wanna help Marty,
you get that prick.

1135
01:23:13,008 --> 01:23:14,175
- Understand?
- Damn it!

1136
01:23:14,176 --> 01:23:15,878
Cover me. I'm moving in.

1137
01:23:15,879 --> 01:23:17,348
Copy that.

1138
01:23:21,116 --> 01:23:22,351
Psst.

1139
01:23:25,689 --> 01:23:27,424
What the fuck was that?

1140
01:23:41,738 --> 01:23:44,238
You don't pay me
enough for this shit.

1141
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:45,575
I'm out of here.

1142
01:23:50,412 --> 01:23:52,315
- Ow!
- You fucking idiot.

1143
01:24:09,398 --> 01:24:11,501
Come out and fight me, you coward.

1144
01:24:18,307 --> 01:24:20,444
You wanna play? Let's play.

1145
01:24:29,218 --> 01:24:31,587
Oh, you bastard.

1146
01:24:31,588 --> 01:24:33,254
You wanna tell me
who's in the house?

1147
01:24:33,255 --> 01:24:35,323
I'll tell you how long
before you bleed out.

1148
01:24:35,324 --> 01:24:37,629
Hollis! And a girl.

1149
01:24:39,596 --> 01:24:41,463
Apply pressure on it.

1150
01:24:41,464 --> 01:24:42,531
Prick.

1151
01:24:46,435 --> 01:24:48,238
Eyes open. I'm going in.

1152
01:25:43,425 --> 01:25:45,461
Untie me.

1153
01:25:45,462 --> 01:25:47,197
Careful.

1154
01:25:49,833 --> 01:25:51,803
I almost thought you
wouldn't be that stupid.

1155
01:25:53,036 --> 01:25:55,336
Stone cold as you are,

1156
01:25:55,337 --> 01:25:57,106
I thought you might
leave the bitch.

1157
01:25:57,107 --> 01:25:59,879
But you're not really
cold, are you?

1158
01:26:01,376 --> 01:26:03,211
Guess not.

1159
01:26:03,212 --> 01:26:05,080
Shit, John, I don't
have many regrets,

1160
01:26:05,081 --> 01:26:07,181
but fuckin' with you
might be one of 'em.

1161
01:26:07,182 --> 01:26:09,620
And then you let me get
the drop on you...

1162
01:26:11,054 --> 01:26:12,724
over a girl.

1163
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:17,759
Guess you got one more regret
now, huh, motherfucker?

1164
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,495
Drop the gun.

1165
01:26:22,331 --> 01:26:23,600
Look at you.

1166
01:26:26,035 --> 01:26:27,636
Well, come on, killer.

1167
01:26:27,637 --> 01:26:30,171
Go to work. What gets
you hard, ain't it?

1168
01:26:30,172 --> 01:26:31,307
Hurting people?

1169
01:26:32,742 --> 01:26:34,676
Okay, come on.
Come on, soldier boy.

1170
01:26:34,677 --> 01:26:36,745
Why don't you get off?

1171
01:26:36,746 --> 01:26:38,348
Huh? Come on. Go to work.

1172
01:26:48,223 --> 01:26:50,193
Come on, John.
Finish the sick fuck.

1173
01:26:58,367 --> 01:27:00,068
Jesus.

1174
01:27:00,069 --> 01:27:02,604
Ugh. Detective Farragut,

1175
01:27:02,605 --> 01:27:04,474
meet John Nguyen.

1176
01:27:08,678 --> 01:27:10,347
Shit. Ugh!

1177
01:27:11,648 --> 01:27:13,582
Johnny, this is Cory.

1178
01:27:13,583 --> 01:27:16,417
He was there that night
your family got barbecued.

1179
01:27:16,418 --> 01:27:19,253
I wasn't there myself, but...

1180
01:27:19,254 --> 01:27:21,023
from what I heard

1181
01:27:21,024 --> 01:27:23,926
old Cory here had a pretty
good time with your sister.

1182
01:27:23,927 --> 01:27:25,827
Hell,

1183
01:27:25,828 --> 01:27:27,996
we all did. I just
got to go first.

1184
01:27:27,997 --> 01:27:30,000
- Fuck you.
- Can we speed this up?

1185
01:27:31,501 --> 01:27:33,301
Put the cuffs on him.

1186
01:27:33,302 --> 01:27:34,638
Ah, Jesus.

1187
01:27:39,642 --> 01:27:42,044
All right. Hill the gimp.

1188
01:27:42,045 --> 01:27:44,012
- No! You let him go!
- Jeez.

1189
01:27:44,013 --> 01:27:46,782
You got me! You got me!

1190
01:27:46,783 --> 01:27:48,217
Let him go!

1191
01:27:48,218 --> 01:27:49,785
Hey, aren't you gonna
say please, John?

1192
01:27:49,786 --> 01:27:52,156
Please! You got me!

1193
01:27:55,658 --> 01:27:57,026
It's cool, bro.

1194
01:27:58,228 --> 01:28:00,532
Look at him.

1195
01:28:06,469 --> 01:28:08,371
No! No!

1196
01:28:09,572 --> 01:28:10,940
No!

1197
01:28:12,742 --> 01:28:13,809
No!

1198
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:15,911
No no!

1199
01:28:15,912 --> 01:28:20,249
- No! Oh fuck!
- Jesus Christ.

1200
01:28:20,250 --> 01:28:23,351
- No.
- Jesus, Hollis.

1201
01:28:23,352 --> 01:28:26,054
Don't worry. You'll get your money.

1202
01:28:26,055 --> 01:28:27,823
- You like money, don't you, Mark, huh?
- Fuck!

1203
01:28:27,824 --> 01:28:30,996
Getting your pretty little
wife all waxed and Botoxed?

1204
01:28:32,294 --> 01:28:34,263
How do you think I get that money?

1205
01:28:34,264 --> 01:28:36,732
What do you think, I was out

1206
01:28:36,733 --> 01:28:39,835
in a red fuckin' Santa suit
ringing a bell? Look at this.

1207
01:28:39,836 --> 01:28:42,373
That's the tit you've
been sucking on.

1208
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:46,509
All right, Cory. You
think you can take him?

1209
01:28:47,677 --> 01:28:50,078
I'm gonna fuck this gook up.

1210
01:28:50,079 --> 01:28:51,815
Take the cuffs off.

1211
01:28:57,386 --> 01:28:59,221
- Sorry.
- You ain't sorry,

1212
01:28:59,222 --> 01:29:01,059
but you will be.

1213
01:29:04,393 --> 01:29:05,794
All right, come on, guys.

1214
01:29:05,795 --> 01:29:07,197
Let's have some fun.

1215
01:29:26,549 --> 01:29:28,583
Don't you wanna know?

1216
01:29:28,584 --> 01:29:29,751
Know what?

1217
01:29:29,752 --> 01:29:31,153
If you still got it.

1218
01:29:31,154 --> 01:29:32,854
Finish it, Hollis.

1219
01:29:32,855 --> 01:29:35,125
You got three guns on me.

1220
01:29:36,759 --> 01:29:38,426
Don't you wanna see if you can?

1221
01:29:38,427 --> 01:29:41,432
Huh? What is it? You don't
wanna get your hands dirty?

1222
01:29:46,736 --> 01:29:49,171
If you want something done...

1223
01:29:49,172 --> 01:29:51,142
think I'm gonna enjoy this.

1224
01:30:26,008 --> 01:30:27,744
That's all you got, soldier boy?

1225
01:30:34,984 --> 01:30:36,352
Hollis!

1226
01:30:40,289 --> 01:30:41,992
I got him. Say the word, Hollis!

1227
01:31:23,599 --> 01:31:25,936
I'm sorry, man.

1228
01:31:27,570 --> 01:31:29,337
We fucked 'em up though.

1229
01:31:29,338 --> 01:31:31,208
We got 'em.

1230
01:31:35,278 --> 01:31:36,814
Fuck 'em.

1231
01:31:48,224 --> 01:31:50,061
You still alive, kid?

1232
01:31:56,165 --> 01:31:58,535
Still wanna know what
happened at the motel?

1233
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,377
I got a pretty good idea
what happened there, kiddo.

1234
01:32:07,743 --> 01:32:10,080
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

1235
01:32:11,447 --> 01:32:13,952
- What about all this?
- What about all this?

1236
01:32:15,418 --> 01:32:19,793
I call this in, you're going
to jail for a very long time.

1237
01:32:21,791 --> 01:32:23,426
I know.

1238
01:32:24,427 --> 01:32:27,429
It's not gonna happen.
Not on my watch.

1239
01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:29,297
But you're a cop.

1240
01:32:29,298 --> 01:32:31,399
Yeah, I am.

1241
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,370
And that's not justice.

1242
01:32:38,674 --> 01:32:42,781
This is a, uh, certain
kind of justice.

1243
01:32:43,813 --> 01:32:46,918
Everybody here got exactly
what they deserved.

1244
01:32:53,055 --> 01:32:54,992
Except for him.

1245
01:32:57,960 --> 01:33:00,297
He's my friend.

1246
01:33:02,932 --> 01:33:05,937
Yeah. He was.

1247
01:33:08,838 --> 01:33:10,975
I got this. Get out of here.

1248
01:34:05,261 --> 01:34:07,799
I know that J.P. died with honor.

1249
01:34:10,866 --> 01:34:13,537
And I know that my family
would be proud of me.

1250
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,980
I won't be ashamed and afraid
to see them again someday.

1251
01:34:25,014 --> 01:34:27,919
They say what doesn't kill
us makes us stronger.

1252
01:34:30,753 --> 01:34:32,988
I don't know if that's true,

1253
01:34:32,989 --> 01:34:35,594
but I know that the
nightmares have subsided.
