1
00:00:17,665 --> 00:00:22,235
THE EVENT

2
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:27,158
based on the story with the same
title by A. P. Chekhov

3
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,881
Calm down, Jaka.

4
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:42,716
There, go there.

5
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:56,779
Leg.

6
00:03:00,143 --> 00:03:01,343
Easy.

7
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:09,695
There, take it.

8
00:04:06,252 --> 00:04:07,452
Marjan.

9
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,764
Marjan, come on.

10
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,109
What time is it?
- Hurry up.

11
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:44,074
Come on, Mira.

12
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,700
Are you ready?
- Yes.

13
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:05,138
Did you hear the wolves?

14
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:12,220
You're wearing that?
- It'll be cold on the road.

15
00:06:14,348 --> 00:06:15,715
Hold the horse.

16
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:28,761
Easy, Mira.

17
00:07:01,684 --> 00:07:05,283
As if they're coming down. - They won't,
there's no ice in the mountains.

18
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:09,180
I'm not afraid of wolves.
- Fools aren't afraid. Prepare the dog.

19
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:13,415
Lets go, Mira.

20
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:08,854
If way over river isn't working
we'll have to come back.

21
00:08:09,977 --> 00:08:11,748
It was working yesterday.

22
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:30,350
I was reading in newspapers that wolves
are intelligent. - You don't have to be

23
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,946
afraid now, they stayed in mountains.

24
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,809
You think it's possible?

25
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,741
It's possible, everything's possible.

26
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:15,565
The Bedekovic forest is near.
- Then the sawmill is close too.

27
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:31,833
Here's the forest.

28
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:04,754
Look.

29
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:10,147
We shouldn't lose our way.

30
00:10:11,913 --> 00:10:14,183
You're right. It's better to wait.

31
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:17,369
Easy, Mira.

32
00:10:32,004 --> 00:10:33,976
We won't long like this, are we?

33
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,033
Is it a wolf?

34
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:44,315
No, a bird...Easy, Mira!

35
00:10:46,043 --> 00:10:47,727
Wolves won't come here.

36
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:05,347
Are you going to the faire?

37
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:07,290
Stand here and don't move.

38
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:17,532
Sawmill is somewhere here.

39
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:24,269
Don't think I feel sorry for Mira.

40
00:11:25,174 --> 00:11:26,052
What?

41
00:11:26,618 --> 00:11:28,638
Don't think I feel sorry for the hourse.

42
00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:31,460
She isn't for work anymore,
we have to sell her.

43
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,111
I'm not sorry for horse,

44
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:36,623
but I thought how father left
and never came back.

45
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:41,832
Now mother left and didn't return.

46
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,579
She sent you a blouse.

47
00:11:46,911 --> 00:11:47,674
Yes.

48
00:11:48,063 --> 00:11:50,323
If you leave I'll be left alone.

49
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:54,504
What did you eat?
Where'd I go?

50
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:58,962
It just came to me.

51
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,562
Why are you laughing?

52
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:16,132
When I was child, there was a fairy
at my grandpa's.

53
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:24,024
She was like a picture. With long hair
and beautiful voice when she sang.

54
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:26,112
But she always hid her legs.

55
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:29,115
Once she slipped

56
00:12:30,037 --> 00:12:32,651
and under the skirt there was a
horse hoof.

57
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,496
My grandpa laughed and said to me

58
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:38,110
'Look at the horse hoof of our Marica'.

59
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,346
She just looked at him,
tapped with legs and...

60
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:43,656
...off to the skies.

61
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:46,869
As a rocket.
- Indeed. No one saw her after.

62
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,604
It's a beautiful story.

63
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:55,048
Perhaps it is a story.

64
00:13:01,117 --> 00:13:02,349
Shall we go?

65
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:20,630
Did you see? - What?
- That dog.

66
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,071
That's a wolf.
- So close?

67
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,846
Keep close to me. He's not alone.

68
00:13:25,966 --> 00:13:27,960
Keep close. Hold the horse. Tight.

69
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,345
Shall we go back? - It's safer to move,
we'll make a torch.

70
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:34,991
Don't be afraid, Marjan.

71
00:13:35,544 --> 00:13:36,857
Don't be afraid.

72
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:49,711
Lets go.

73
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:55,965
Maybe it's a dog, there sawmills here.
- Don't talk, find another branch.

74
00:13:59,957 --> 00:14:01,708
Come on, Mira, come on.

75
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:14,449
Marjan, come to me.

76
00:14:15,391 --> 00:14:16,853
We're ruined, grandpa.

77
00:14:24,674 --> 00:14:26,943
Light over here, give battery here.

78
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:28,958
Here, Matijevic.

79
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,288
Matijevic, do you hear me?

80
00:14:34,263 --> 00:14:35,691
He killed him.

81
00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:42,786
Don't Marjan, don't son.

82
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:45,827
Come on, calm youself,
everything's finished.

83
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:48,632
Where did the wolves come from,
damned beasts.

84
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,103
It's not real?
- Yes, it's real.

85
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:02,937
He killed him near sawmill.

86
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:04,220
He must have rabies.

87
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,403
Why does he carry it around?
- I wouldn't play with it.

88
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:08,142
He'll get reward.

89
00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:09,570
He'll get it alright.

90
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:12,382
That over there is a man
the wolf attacked.

91
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:15,498
A child is with him?

92
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:16,937
That's his grandson.

93
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:18,239
The only one.

94
00:15:20,404 --> 00:15:23,260
What is it godmother, you wouldn't
want a wolf, would you?

95
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:26,818
Did you go crazy maybe?

96
00:15:27,164 --> 00:15:28,938
Don't worry I wouldn't you.

97
00:15:44,205 --> 00:15:45,472
What do you want?

98
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:48,455
Leave me alone.

99
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:52,452
Move people!

100
00:16:02,813 --> 00:16:04,414
What got into you?

101
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:08,108
Come on wolf, bite.

102
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:18,868
Taking it to a sell?

103
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:21,517
If chance appears.

104
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:23,855
I wouldn't give it under 300.

105
00:16:24,823 --> 00:16:26,409
We'll see about that.

106
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:35,023
Matijevic, do you want a drink?

107
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:37,280
Of course he is.

108
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:40,759
Yes, he's floating downstream.

109
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:45,169
He's not floating but he's in your house.

110
00:16:46,022 --> 00:16:47,956
When he dies he doesn't bite.

111
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:52,591
You're selling the horse, Juro?
- Yes, I do.

112
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:55,276
I want to tell you something.
- Say it.

113
00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:57,568
When people get out...

114
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:14,587
I'll be fast, Marjan.

115
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:17,472
On Jesus' day one has to watch out, Juro.
- What's going on?

116
00:17:18,283 --> 00:17:20,287
At the last faire that Moholjic

117
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:22,683
change leader from Luzane was coming
back by himself

118
00:17:22,803 --> 00:17:25,044
he had money for payments...
- And?

119
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:29,963
It happens. One should be careful.

120
00:17:30,205 --> 00:17:31,967
All sorts of things pass by.

121
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:35,618
The one in leather coat over there
came back from prison.

122
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:37,852
I see by the way one holds knife in hand.

123
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:39,844
That Logar is pure bum.

124
00:17:39,964 --> 00:17:43,571
There are all sorts of people.
- There better be none like that.

125
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:47,015
They wait up for a man, traveler,
on deserted place

126
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:48,985
rob him and put knife over his throat.

127
00:17:49,105 --> 00:17:51,576
If you make sound, they will kill you.

128
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:54,020
People keep quiet.

129
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,839
If they're quiet how do you know?

130
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:58,396
Don't joke Jura, something's in the air.

131
00:17:58,752 --> 00:17:59,788
I hear it.

132
00:17:59,908 --> 00:18:01,205
It makes waves.

133
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:02,932
Okay, Blaz.

134
00:18:04,545 --> 00:18:06,644
I'll look around myself better.

135
00:18:07,011 --> 00:18:09,965
Look Juro, look. I can smell blood.

136
00:18:10,955 --> 00:18:13,926
Water flows clear and suddenly it gets red.

137
00:18:21,057 --> 00:18:24,074
Why did you talk for so long?
- Nothing, he just kept me longer.

138
00:18:24,194 --> 00:18:25,986
It must be for something.

139
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,775
He's alone for long time without a faire
and he can't wait to talk to somebody.

140
00:18:29,895 --> 00:18:32,671
He lives on water so his thoughts
flow easily.

141
00:19:03,154 --> 00:19:04,882
<i>All who want to have fun</i>

142
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,268
<i>all who want to spend pleasant evening</i>

143
00:19:09,005 --> 00:19:11,309
<i>tonight at Lipovac</i>

144
00:19:12,242 --> 00:19:13,981
<i>at Stari grad</i>

145
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:16,964
<i>there is a traditional carnival show</i>

146
00:19:17,505 --> 00:19:19,912
<i>that since a couple of years</i>

147
00:19:20,032 --> 00:19:22,471
<i>is organized by touristical society.</i>

148
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,240
<i>Award for the best mask...</i>

149
00:20:01,584 --> 00:20:03,277
Hi, Juro.
- Hi, Miko.

150
00:20:03,397 --> 00:20:04,797
Selling the horse?

151
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:07,067
Yes, I do.
- How much does it cost?

152
00:20:07,187 --> 00:20:08,195
3 thousand.

153
00:20:08,315 --> 00:20:10,948
You'll sell it, Italians are buying.
Good bye.

154
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:19,731
Why don't you take a walk?

155
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:21,620
I want to be at your side.

156
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,750
As you wish. You'll get bored.

157
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:37,125
What is it, boy? You'd like a drink?

158
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,672
How much does it cost?
- Three thousand.

159
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,922
2.500 without bargain.

160
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:03,072
I said 3, I won't give it for less.

161
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,443
You could lower it a bit.

162
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,438
Don't butt in.

163
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:23,989
How come there are no Italians?

164
00:21:37,874 --> 00:21:39,602
Come on boy, take it.

165
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:47,789
I'll go for a bit.

166
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:50,357
You may, just not too long.
- Watch my umbrella.

167
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:53,324
Take it with you.
- No, I don't need it.

168
00:21:53,936 --> 00:21:55,548
Alright, give it to me.

169
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:24,729
You wanted batteries for transistor.
A whole package? - Yes, okay.

170
00:22:29,232 --> 00:22:31,708
Just a moment to take a look at magacine.

171
00:22:50,062 --> 00:22:52,654
What's it with you? What are you babbling?

172
00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:55,349
What is it?

173
00:22:57,629 --> 00:22:59,242
What do you want from me?

174
00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:01,074
You don't speak...?

175
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:03,147
What's that language?

176
00:23:03,267 --> 00:23:06,903
That's my language, I made it up.
You don't know how to make up anything.

177
00:23:07,023 --> 00:23:09,150
You've got a couple of boards in
head missing.

178
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,399
How in head? Boards are in house.

179
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:14,474
I made up 'boards in head'.

180
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:16,199
Here are your batteries.

181
00:24:44,786 --> 00:24:47,264
How long will it be like this for God's sake?

182
00:24:52,136 --> 00:24:53,254
Here it goes.

183
00:24:55,683 --> 00:24:58,044
Watch his fingers, he's a real doctor.

184
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:00,255
Who has no luck shouldn't play.

185
00:25:04,984 --> 00:25:07,483
Hold on you lying son of a bitch.

186
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:10,062
You found me to...

187
00:25:14,755 --> 00:25:15,872
Oh people...

188
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,901
Let police make a record.

189
00:25:19,925 --> 00:25:22,966
I deserved it when I plant pumpkins with
the Devil.

190
00:25:57,413 --> 00:25:58,818
Why do you watch me?

191
00:26:00,961 --> 00:26:02,264
Are you hungry?

192
00:26:05,321 --> 00:26:06,530
Do you want one?

193
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,567
I want.

194
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:09,340
Take from mine.

195
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,583
What did you do?

196
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:19,160
There was hair in it.

197
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:21,819
What hair?
- Hair. I'll get poisoned.

198
00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:25,125
Why do you hang to me?

199
00:27:07,547 --> 00:27:08,376
Done.

200
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:11,151
You sold it good.

201
00:27:11,271 --> 00:27:13,857
Three thousand isn't small money
you should celebrate.

202
00:27:13,977 --> 00:27:16,968
Another... - You did well, old guy.
- Another time...

203
00:27:17,814 --> 00:27:20,509
We should leave by day. Are we going,
Marjan?

204
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:25,105
Last Wendsday my son in law was selling
the same horse and got only 200.

205
00:27:25,225 --> 00:27:27,754
He got his axe in honey, when I tell you.

206
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:30,518
Are we going Marjan? Lets go.

207
00:27:30,837 --> 00:27:33,117
He's a good merchant, he sold it good.

208
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,272
I sold it in the last minute.

209
00:27:38,645 --> 00:27:42,130
You're not okay with it?
- I wasn't hoping to never seeing it again.

210
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,703
Is that Mira over there?

211
00:27:51,993 --> 00:27:54,192
Perhaps it is. They payed me good.

212
00:27:56,276 --> 00:27:58,372
What are they going to do with it?

213
00:27:58,492 --> 00:28:01,746
They sell meat. There are people who
ear horse meat.

214
00:28:02,253 --> 00:28:03,992
And they make sausages.

215
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,781
You mustn't be sorry.

216
00:28:09,218 --> 00:28:10,923
You're not child anymore.

217
00:28:21,796 --> 00:28:23,201
I'm not sorry.

218
00:28:51,275 --> 00:28:53,233
Wind blows from south.
- Yes.

219
00:28:55,111 --> 00:28:57,232
As long as there's no frost after.

220
00:28:57,801 --> 00:28:59,160
It's good now.

221
00:29:00,392 --> 00:29:02,477
You mean because of the wolves?

222
00:29:03,686 --> 00:29:04,423
Yes.

223
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,521
We'll get home during the day.

224
00:29:10,641 --> 00:29:13,331
When we made it this morning
I'm not afraid anymore.

225
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:17,646
I believe that wolf was either old or
sick, it wouldn't wander to sawmill.

226
00:29:17,766 --> 00:29:19,823
It better not to meet it.

227
00:29:20,042 --> 00:29:22,497
I love you like this and not like before.

228
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:24,287
I was thinking about it all.

229
00:29:24,407 --> 00:29:26,429
And what did you come up with?

230
00:29:26,774 --> 00:29:28,640
I remembered a story.

231
00:29:29,527 --> 00:29:30,472
Which one?

232
00:29:30,592 --> 00:29:32,372
It's not a story, it's truth.

233
00:29:32,492 --> 00:29:35,297
In North Pole mothers hunt fish
for young seals

234
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:37,061
and they just eat and grow.

235
00:29:37,181 --> 00:29:40,491
One day when mother leaves he just
stands and waits.

236
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:42,553
Until he spends all reserves.

237
00:29:42,673 --> 00:29:44,810
Then when he sees mother's
not coming back

238
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,904
he jumps alone in the water
and hunts fish by himself.

239
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:49,954
You made it up well.

240
00:29:52,108 --> 00:29:53,052
I know.

241
00:29:57,141 --> 00:29:58,845
The boat is on our side.

242
00:30:21,692 --> 00:30:23,996
You two are returning first from faire.

243
00:30:24,226 --> 00:30:26,276
We have to go home by day, Blaz.

244
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,630
You sold the horse, Jura?

245
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:32,875
As you can see.

246
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,290
Who are those people?

247
00:30:57,876 --> 00:30:59,430
Nothing good, my Jura.

248
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:13,336
Wait, we want too, wait.

249
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,215
Did you see who came?

250
00:31:41,989 --> 00:31:43,555
Don't mention them.

251
00:31:55,855 --> 00:31:57,018
Hey Lugar,

252
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:02,853
did you sell the wolf?

253
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,204
How does it go?

254
00:33:21,492 --> 00:33:22,839
River moves it.

255
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,006
I see but I don't undestand how.

256
00:33:26,709 --> 00:33:28,529
It's connected to the rope

257
00:33:28,794 --> 00:33:31,245
water carries it while rope holds it.

258
00:33:33,016 --> 00:33:34,122
Understand?

259
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:35,676
I don't.

260
00:33:37,035 --> 00:33:38,786
I don't understand either.

261
00:33:46,745 --> 00:33:47,931
Wood squeaks.

262
00:34:00,192 --> 00:34:01,677
Ducks are coming back.

263
00:34:30,145 --> 00:34:31,365
Good bye, Blaz.

264
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:47,134
Do you want to spend the night at
my place?

265
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:48,971
Don't even think about it.

266
00:34:49,091 --> 00:34:51,044
Everyone have their own houses
for sleeping.

267
00:34:51,164 --> 00:34:53,866
I thought you'd stay and catch up.

268
00:34:54,395 --> 00:34:55,512
Another time.

269
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,138
Boatman!

270
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,777
Are you coming this way?

271
00:35:08,229 --> 00:35:09,046
Easy.

272
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:12,100
You'll all get your turn.

273
00:35:15,557 --> 00:35:17,342
We'll go here, it's shorter.

274
00:35:29,005 --> 00:35:31,758
What are you looking at?
- I looked accidentally.

275
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:39,091
Spring could come soon.

276
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,212
There will be more winter.

277
00:35:51,311 --> 00:35:53,292
I forgot it has new batteries.

278
00:35:58,014 --> 00:35:59,787
Play that, it was good.

279
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:02,775
It easier to walk.

280
00:36:44,755 --> 00:36:47,036
Others are returning from faire too.

281
00:36:56,413 --> 00:36:57,829
Don't look back.

282
00:36:58,392 --> 00:36:59,855
Look in front of you.

283
00:37:00,442 --> 00:37:02,803
Aren't those Lugar and the skinny one?

284
00:37:04,738 --> 00:37:06,281
Turn off the music.

285
00:37:44,956 --> 00:37:47,604
Why do we walk so fast?
- We're going home.

286
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,458
Should we go back to the boat?

287
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,254
Give me your hand.

288
00:38:09,093 --> 00:38:11,776
They are after us?
- I don't know, we'll see.

289
00:38:37,502 --> 00:38:38,676
Play the music.

290
00:38:44,817 --> 00:38:46,522
Perhaps we just imagined.

291
00:38:46,642 --> 00:38:48,341
Why would they chase us?

292
00:39:04,253 --> 00:39:05,047
Wait.

293
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,125
Throw the umbrella!
Throw it, don't you hear!

294
00:40:13,951 --> 00:40:15,575
There's sawmill in swamp.

295
00:40:16,182 --> 00:40:17,702
We have to get there.

296
00:40:18,578 --> 00:40:20,225
Hold on to me, grandpa.

297
00:40:22,436 --> 00:40:23,403
Leave it.

298
00:40:42,134 --> 00:40:43,159
Lets go.

299
00:41:47,534 --> 00:41:50,863
Run away with this into the forest.
- I won't! - You have to.

300
00:41:50,983 --> 00:41:53,495
I won't without you.
- They won't hurt me.

301
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,144
I won't, I won't.

302
00:41:56,705 --> 00:41:59,078
You have to Marjan.
- I'm not going without you.

303
00:41:59,198 --> 00:42:01,623
Listen to grandfather.
- I won't leave you.

304
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:05,085
Marjan stop.

305
00:42:05,205 --> 00:42:06,495
You have to run.

306
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,489
Take the money and run.

307
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,114
Run!

308
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:12,968
Run, Marjan!

309
00:42:16,008 --> 00:42:17,116
Run, Marjan!

310
00:42:21,993 --> 00:42:22,718
Run!

311
00:42:24,515 --> 00:42:25,676
Run Marjan!

312
00:42:27,553 --> 00:42:29,269
Stop you son of a bitch.

313
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,987
Throw it to me.

314
00:46:01,352 --> 00:46:03,021
Do you want one, old man?

315
00:46:07,113 --> 00:46:08,426
I've got mine.

316
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,503
Matijevic, do you have something to drink?

317
00:46:59,576 --> 00:47:01,678
Of course he is.

318
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:10,177
Yes, he's floating downstream.

319
00:47:13,886 --> 00:47:16,700
He's not floating but he's in your house.

320
00:47:23,357 --> 00:47:25,441
When he dies he doesn't bite.

321
00:48:12,023 --> 00:48:13,428
Good bye brothers.

322
00:48:14,844 --> 00:48:16,088
You killed me.

323
00:48:42,747 --> 00:48:43,553
What?

324
00:50:30,404 --> 00:50:31,809
Let me in.
- What?

325
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:33,318
Let me in.

326
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:37,201
My grandpa and me were chased.

327
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:50,094
I'll give you something warm.

328
00:50:50,428 --> 00:50:51,903
To catch your breath.

329
00:51:01,366 --> 00:51:02,442
I'm here.

330
00:51:03,081 --> 00:51:04,497
I won't go anywhere.

331
00:51:05,753 --> 00:51:07,066
Don't be afraid.

332
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:09,980
Sit.

333
00:51:13,332 --> 00:51:14,529
I'm afraid.

334
00:51:14,806 --> 00:51:16,337
They want money.

335
00:51:16,683 --> 00:51:18,502
Grandpa told me to run.

336
00:51:18,928 --> 00:51:19,965
Here this.

337
00:51:28,864 --> 00:51:30,684
We'll put it in safe place.

338
00:51:32,849 --> 00:51:34,680
No one will touch you now.

339
00:51:41,879 --> 00:51:43,491
Did you lock the doors?

340
00:51:45,783 --> 00:51:47,729
I locked them, don't worry.

341
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,720
You should go to bed right away.

342
00:52:04,275 --> 00:52:06,417
You'll remember me, you bump.

343
00:52:12,924 --> 00:52:13,915
I'm afraid.

344
00:52:19,116 --> 00:52:20,210
Eat, it's warm.

345
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:23,032
When my husband returns,
he'll go to the sawmill.

346
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,485
It's not far, only a kilometer.

347
00:52:26,488 --> 00:52:28,170
There's a phone in sawmill.

348
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,358
They'll phone the police.

349
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:32,926
What is your name?

350
00:52:33,245 --> 00:52:34,212
Marjan.

351
00:52:34,857 --> 00:52:36,953
You must be hungry and cold.

352
00:52:38,462 --> 00:52:39,959
Eat while it's warm.

353
00:52:41,696 --> 00:52:42,986
I can't eat.

354
00:52:47,929 --> 00:52:48,712
Eat.

355
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:51,844
Eat, it's warm.

356
00:53:04,755 --> 00:53:06,935
When it's warm in the belly

357
00:53:07,614 --> 00:53:09,760
then it goes all around the body.

358
00:53:11,372 --> 00:53:12,685
Fear melts away.

359
00:54:32,212 --> 00:54:33,421
Come on

360
00:54:33,974 --> 00:54:34,745
cry.

361
00:54:36,266 --> 00:54:37,267
Cry out.

362
00:56:42,612 --> 00:56:43,948
Come on, Marjan.

363
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:45,998
I made the bed.

364
00:56:49,141 --> 00:56:50,166
Wake up.

365
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:51,428
What?

366
00:56:51,547 --> 00:56:53,720
For a moment and you'll sleep again.

367
00:57:21,082 --> 00:57:22,659
You'll be warm here.

368
00:57:23,304 --> 00:57:24,882
There's a chimney near.

369
00:57:27,071 --> 00:57:28,775
You don't have to cover yourself.

370
00:57:28,895 --> 00:57:30,745
Fire burnes the whole night.

371
00:57:36,193 --> 00:57:37,091
Sleep.

372
00:57:38,012 --> 00:57:40,200
Everything will be alright tomorrow.

373
00:57:48,604 --> 00:57:50,412
Call if you need anything.

374
00:59:53,026 --> 00:59:54,281
Are you alone?

375
00:59:58,946 --> 01:00:02,551
Why are you laughing?
- Everything turns out how I want it.

376
01:00:02,671 --> 01:00:04,140
How do you think?
- Everything.

377
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,270
Do you want me to bring sunny beats?

378
01:00:12,641 --> 01:00:14,257
It's sugar beats.

379
01:00:14,534 --> 01:00:15,847
Mine is sunny.

380
01:00:20,444 --> 01:00:21,802
Is it nice now?

381
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,323
We'll stay forever on the wall.

382
01:00:37,273 --> 01:00:39,201
The one downstairs is my mother.

383
01:00:39,321 --> 01:00:40,387
That woman?

384
01:00:40,617 --> 01:00:42,356
Not woman, she's mother.

385
01:00:42,611 --> 01:00:43,336
Okay.

386
01:00:43,456 --> 01:00:45,616
I ran away to the faire

387
01:00:45,736 --> 01:00:48,092
and neighbours returned me
when sausages got spilled.

388
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:49,302
What sausages?

389
01:00:49,422 --> 01:00:51,686
You don't remember sausages spilling?

390
01:00:51,806 --> 01:00:55,153
You mean what happened today?
- It wasn't today but now.

391
01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:58,319
How now?
- Now that I remembered.

392
01:01:00,025 --> 01:01:03,682
When I returned mother beat me and
sent me to bed without dinner.

393
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,744
Why did you run away?

394
01:01:06,308 --> 01:01:08,715
Because I didn't want to eat eggs.

395
01:01:09,223 --> 01:01:11,077
Why didn't you want to eat them?

396
01:01:11,197 --> 01:01:13,703
Because they were from my favorite hen.

397
01:01:14,094 --> 01:01:16,052
Those eggs are her children.

398
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:18,920
Hen lays eggs and chickens come out

399
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,684
and I didn't want to eat her children.

400
01:01:22,307 --> 01:01:24,034
I'm good for nothing.

401
01:01:24,154 --> 01:01:28,532
Why do you say that? - My mother says so,
I'm always weak and ill.

402
01:01:29,995 --> 01:01:34,959
Cause you don't eat eggs. - Lets see what
witch's doing. - What witch? - Downstairs.

403
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:37,274
She's your mother.
- No, she's witch.

404
01:01:37,394 --> 01:01:40,521
She's feeding us and will kill us
and cook us in the pot.

405
01:01:42,504 --> 01:01:44,623
I read that when I was little too.

406
01:01:45,187 --> 01:01:46,051
Quiet.

407
01:01:48,262 --> 01:01:50,047
Isn't she really beautiful?

408
01:01:58,116 --> 01:02:01,249
She'll discover you're not in your room.
- No, she'll wait for her husband.

409
01:02:01,369 --> 01:02:03,149
What husband?
- My father.

410
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:07,964
Then he's father not husband.
- Husband, he beats her.

411
01:02:43,047 --> 01:02:44,499
Lets let her wait.

412
01:02:47,942 --> 01:02:50,026
Just don't beat me please.

413
01:02:50,246 --> 01:02:52,872
You're crazy, why would I?
- Please don't.

414
01:02:52,992 --> 01:02:54,542
I will if you're like that.

415
01:02:55,094 --> 01:02:57,110
See how nicely we play.

416
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:09,290
Do you speak English?
- I don't.

417
01:03:09,613 --> 01:03:11,732
I know.
- Come on, say something.

418
01:03:15,383 --> 01:03:16,362
That's English?

419
01:03:16,482 --> 01:03:18,481
You don't believe it's English?

420
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,256
I believe, everything could happen.

421
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,525
We talked nicely.

422
01:03:23,964 --> 01:03:26,671
Now we have to pack up and go home.

423
01:03:28,444 --> 01:03:30,344
How when our home is far?

424
01:03:30,633 --> 01:03:32,883
There's plenty of snow we'll take sledges.

425
01:03:33,004 --> 01:03:34,198
Come on, help.

426
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:40,648
Prepare the horse.

427
01:03:40,947 --> 01:03:42,341
It's 3, not one.

428
01:03:42,461 --> 01:03:45,911
It's three you don't know.
- Wait to dance the last dance.

429
01:03:52,535 --> 01:03:54,492
Hurry up, wolves will attack us.

430
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:58,646
Cover yourself, there will be wind.

431
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:00,972
Brace yourself not to fall.

432
01:04:01,409 --> 01:04:02,745
Mira's in the middle.

433
01:04:02,865 --> 01:04:04,588
Mira's the fastest horse.

434
01:04:05,244 --> 01:04:06,511
Do you hear wolves?

435
01:04:06,631 --> 01:04:08,585
I hear them.
- They're running after us.

436
01:04:08,705 --> 01:04:10,301
Do you see?
- I see.

437
01:04:11,752 --> 01:04:13,352
Don't let yourself go.

438
01:04:14,689 --> 01:04:16,727
Are they going to catch us?
- No.

439
01:04:19,157 --> 01:04:21,375
They won't, there's our house.

440
01:04:28,575 --> 01:04:31,443
We're going to bed now.
- We won't have dinner?

441
01:04:32,145 --> 01:04:36,498
There's no table in our house as you can
see, that's why we go straight to bed.

442
01:04:36,855 --> 01:04:39,216
Cover me with your cape, it's cold.

443
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,804
What is your name?

444
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:46,960
Marjan.

445
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:48,518
Kiss me, Marjan.

446
01:04:48,638 --> 01:04:50,948
Why?
- Cause we're husband and wife.

447
01:05:01,556 --> 01:05:02,984
You know Marjan

448
01:05:03,974 --> 01:05:05,610
I see all sorts of things.

449
01:05:11,363 --> 01:05:12,962
What are you doing?

450
01:05:17,284 --> 01:05:19,172
I look if you have a hoof.

451
01:05:22,213 --> 01:05:23,515
I see nicely.

452
01:05:23,768 --> 01:05:26,083
Workers got ants on railroad

453
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:29,077
they put railroad on little tables.

454
01:05:32,371 --> 01:05:34,456
Did you go to the forest Fecuan?

455
01:05:35,135 --> 01:05:38,574
Forest Fecuan never existed.

456
01:06:19,376 --> 01:06:22,198
You see grandpa I'm left alone.

457
01:06:54,437 --> 01:06:57,490
Son of a bitch.
- Quiet, you'll awake the child.

458
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:58,745
Leave that.

459
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:01,981
Why are you angry with me?
What did I do to you?

460
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:03,018
Shut up.

461
01:07:03,138 --> 01:07:04,630
I'll brake your head.

462
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:06,532
It's to go crazy.

463
01:07:07,477 --> 01:07:10,736
I was saying it'll bring unfortune
to the house. - Shut it!

464
01:07:10,856 --> 01:07:12,626
I'll pull your tongue out.

465
01:07:14,042 --> 01:07:15,159
Don't cry.

466
01:07:16,317 --> 01:07:17,648
Take off my boots.

467
01:07:23,341 --> 01:07:25,483
You beat me as it's my fault.

468
01:07:25,603 --> 01:07:27,049
Don't talk too much.

469
01:07:29,505 --> 01:07:31,462
What would you do without me?

470
01:07:38,521 --> 01:07:42,208
I didn't move from house but money
came by itself. - Where from?

471
01:07:48,203 --> 01:07:49,919
Did he have a red blouse?

472
01:08:29,028 --> 01:08:30,030
Is it fair?

473
01:08:33,215 --> 01:08:34,816
As brother to brother.

474
01:08:35,564 --> 01:08:37,142
You're fine brothers.

475
01:08:38,524 --> 01:08:39,607
By blood.

476
01:08:47,244 --> 01:08:49,075
Aren't you a witch, woman.

477
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,726
I was sure we killed the man
for nothing.

478
01:08:54,557 --> 01:08:56,417
Marry Matijevic, I tell you

479
01:08:56,536 --> 01:08:57,993
see what's woman like.

480
01:08:58,225 --> 01:09:00,955
Who would want such a bum?
- Don't start!

481
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:04,307
Bring brandy.

482
01:09:18,221 --> 01:09:20,707
O Matijevic, do we want a drink?

483
01:09:27,821 --> 01:09:29,330
Just don't shout.

484
01:09:32,681 --> 01:09:34,282
What did you give us?

485
01:09:36,194 --> 01:09:38,682
Give us proper glasses to drink like
men.

486
01:09:41,193 --> 01:09:43,876
Leave it, you'll destroy everything
of mine.

487
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:48,974
You poisoned my heart...

488
01:09:55,469 --> 01:09:58,775
That's how you sing to those whores
of yours at the faire?

489
01:09:59,928 --> 01:10:02,645
I sing to nobody as I sing to you
my doll.

490
01:10:04,073 --> 01:10:05,098
My people

491
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:09,786
how harder is to bury a man
than to kill him.

492
01:10:13,086 --> 01:10:14,676
Did you hide him well?

493
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:18,868
Don't let something happen.

494
01:10:19,456 --> 01:10:21,793
What'd I do without you?
- Leave me.

495
01:10:23,337 --> 01:10:27,023
You poisoned my heart...

496
01:10:37,138 --> 01:10:38,294
Well, cheers.

497
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:43,995
No.

498
01:10:44,997 --> 01:10:47,507
I scared you?
- You'll wake up children.

499
01:10:48,095 --> 01:10:49,730
Come on, I was joking.

500
01:10:51,055 --> 01:10:51,804
Here,

501
01:10:53,266 --> 01:10:54,072
drink.

502
01:10:54,591 --> 01:10:55,777
We'll together.

503
01:11:08,994 --> 01:11:10,134
You Satan,

504
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:13,036
from whose face did you take that smile?

505
01:11:13,567 --> 01:11:15,283
Don't touch me, woman.

506
01:11:17,414 --> 01:11:18,370
Be calm.

507
01:11:18,854 --> 01:11:20,650
I didn't touch you yet.

508
01:11:21,525 --> 01:11:23,103
Don't challenge him.

509
01:11:47,055 --> 01:11:49,381
Quiet, you'll wake up the little one.

510
01:14:38,700 --> 01:14:40,819
Quiet, your child will wake up.

511
01:15:14,948 --> 01:15:17,586
My mother, why did you give brith to me?

512
01:15:22,342 --> 01:15:23,529
Don't cry...

513
01:15:32,743 --> 01:15:34,309
Why do you cry?

514
01:15:35,988 --> 01:15:37,351
What is it?

515
01:15:41,894 --> 01:15:43,023
It's nothing.

516
01:15:44,992 --> 01:15:46,259
Let me cry.

517
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,161
Don't cry, don't cry,

518
01:15:54,281 --> 01:15:56,418
don't cry, don't cry...

519
01:16:14,473 --> 01:16:15,486
Lets go.

520
01:19:34,147 --> 01:19:34,907
Ivan?

521
01:19:35,633 --> 01:19:37,314
What is it?
- Get up.

522
01:19:41,265 --> 01:19:42,474
Get up fool!

523
01:19:44,997 --> 01:19:46,626
What is it? What do you want?

524
01:19:46,745 --> 01:19:48,320
We have to kill the kid.

525
01:19:49,644 --> 01:19:51,487
It was enough of killing.

526
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:54,424
I don't feel like it.
- We have to, he saw everything.

527
01:19:55,265 --> 01:19:58,052
I told you this one would ruin you.

528
01:19:58,272 --> 01:19:59,907
That's Devil in human form.

529
01:20:00,027 --> 01:20:01,842
Leave my husband alone!

530
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:04,007
Enough.

531
01:20:04,778 --> 01:20:05,619
Enough!

532
01:20:07,450 --> 01:20:08,841
That's our business.

533
01:20:14,168 --> 01:20:16,482
Alright, kill him.
- Oh no, cousin,

534
01:20:17,781 --> 01:20:18,963
you'll kill him.

535
01:20:19,083 --> 01:20:20,591
- Me? How come?

536
01:20:21,397 --> 01:20:22,088
You.

537
01:20:26,426 --> 01:20:28,234
I want you to be my cousin.

538
01:20:28,776 --> 01:20:30,607
Blood ties are the safest.

539
01:20:31,678 --> 01:20:34,903
If something happen, you can't get out
as an accomplice.

540
01:20:47,073 --> 01:20:49,008
Why me? Lets throw a dice.

541
01:20:50,977 --> 01:20:51,852
Alright.

542
01:20:52,324 --> 01:20:55,100
Don't Ivan. He'll trick you,
he cheats.

543
01:20:56,506 --> 01:20:57,484
Shut up.

544
01:21:07,846 --> 01:21:10,253
Do you want first?
- Just pull a card.

545
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:18,476
King.

546
01:21:23,059 --> 01:21:23,739
Ace.

547
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:31,712
All boards in my head thumbled over.

548
01:23:47,874 --> 01:23:49,038
Is it over?

549
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:52,919
Leave me alone.

550
01:23:54,843 --> 01:23:56,587
I've to come to my senses.

551
01:24:08,071 --> 01:24:09,085
What is it?

552
01:24:11,942 --> 01:24:13,301
Leave me alone,

553
01:24:13,646 --> 01:24:15,293
I've to come to my senses.

554
01:24:30,952 --> 01:24:33,544
I want to see her, I want to see  her!

555
01:24:36,055 --> 01:24:38,450
It's your fault, you led him to it!

556
01:24:38,842 --> 01:24:39,660
Satan!

557
01:27:10,636 --> 01:27:11,707
Grandpa!

558
01:27:12,755 --> 01:27:13,883
Grandpa!

559
01:27:14,644 --> 01:27:16,700
My grandpa!

560
01:27:17,146 --> 01:27:19,683
Grandpa!

561
01:27:20,179 --> 01:27:21,941
My grandpa!

562
01:27:22,816 --> 01:27:25,362
Grandpa, where are you?

563
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:28,138
Grandpa!

564
01:27:29,566 --> 01:27:31,443
My grandpa!

565
01:27:32,594 --> 01:27:34,806
Grandpa, where are you?

566
01:27:36,004 --> 01:27:37,329
Grandpa!

567
01:27:37,893 --> 01:27:39,632
My grandpa!
