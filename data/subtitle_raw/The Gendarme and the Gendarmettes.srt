1
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,431
Don't you miss our old place,
Cruchot?

2
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,952
Times change, sergeant,
and we have to change with them.

3
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,673
Come in.

4
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,469
Can I borrow your vacuum cleaner?
- Of course, Germaine.

5
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,234
This place is quite roomy.
Thanks, Josépha.

6
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,630
It looks like a frightening monster,
but it's not.

7
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,272
In no time, this machine has
the answer to everything.

8
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,156
It knows even the most intimate
secrets of our fellow citizens.

9
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,279
Take Cruchot's file,
for instance.

10
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,509
Sergeant, with all due respect,
but I refuse.

11
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,598
It will all not be true.

12
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,076
Cruchot, Ludovic, Maryvonne.

13
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,875
Born on the 31st of July in Courbevoie.

14
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,438
Tendency towards hypocrisy
and schizophrenia.

15
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,269
Used to bite his friends as a child.
- Not at all.

16
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,395
Used to pull fly wings out.
- A dragonfly. Once.

17
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,752
Peed in bed until the age of 14.
Well, well, Cruchot...

18
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,036
Pee never. Only number two.

19
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,229
Not very democratic, is it?
- Clean the sergeant's desk.

20
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,671
We're all in.
Perlin, you stay here.

21
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:40,188
Blonde. 1.70 meters,
at first sight.

22
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,276
Chest size, hip size...
Her address...

23
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:48,837
Her phone number...
My data...

24
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,790
Can't we do things together?

25
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:55,877
Yes, at my parents' in Sweden.

26
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,829
Perlin, don't touch that. Come on.

27
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,512
Attention.

28
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:44,836
At ease. And gentlemen,
do you like the new place?

29
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:47,269
Very good, colonel, very good.

30
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,869
No problems with the computer?

31
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,158
It looks much more
complicated than it is.

32
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,635
I see you already tested it.

33
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:04,790
What's that filth?
- The machine.

34
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,994
Who dared?

35
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,158
I'll start an investigation.
- Never mind.

36
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,430
Anyway, you've already got
used to the machine.

37
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,354
We still have an obsolete model
at headquarters, ourselves.

38
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,158
From now on, only
use it professionally...

39
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,550
...and not for your
personal delusions.

40
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:40,070
Gentlemen, I have a
difficult task for you.

41
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,151
You're capable of treating
women courteously.

42
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,472
Don't disappoint me.

43
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:56,790
Four young, female assistants will
be trained by you.

44
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:02,595
We might be a bit short on space.

45
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,592
So we'll have to sit a bit closer.

46
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:10,435
They're staying with the sisters.
So, that's agreed.

47
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,631
When will they be coming?

48
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,428
With the 03.45 pm train in Hyères.

49
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:21,507
They'll have to work closely together
with you. But be careful.

50
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,829
Avoid any risks.

51
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:29,950
Mind their safety.
That's all, gentlemen.

52
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,314
Attention. Attention.

53
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,672
Don't pretend to be tough.
Remember who and where you are.

54
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:58,592
It's not a mixed school.
Remember that.

55
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,828
You're such a macho, chief.
- Four days on water and bread.

56
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,714
That will make you...

57
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,954
Can I go with you to the station?
- And me too?

58
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,350
Me neither?
- I said No.

59
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:21,356
Silence. Common courtesy says
the superior will go.

60
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,712
So, I'm going.

61
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:30,318
Can I join you, my dear sergeant?
- Brownnoser.

62
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,996
Yes, as driver.
You mind the store.

63
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,110
Gendarmes!

64
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,473
Let's go.

65
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,193
Ladies, welcome. Cruchot, the luggage.

66
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,073
We're staying in the Les Bleuets pension.

67
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,159
We're taking you to the gendarmerie.

68
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,512
And you'll stay with the nuns.

69
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,592
Excuse me, ladies, I'm late.

70
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,716
Goodbye. Goodbye.

71
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,271
Cruchot, we're going back.

72
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,511
They were not our gendarmettes.
- Not at all.

73
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:18,675
You made me come here for nothing.
- You gave the order, sergeant.

74
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,036
What? Me?
- Yes, you.

75
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,598
Wait, no, it was me.
I remember now.

76
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,233
Faster.

77
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,313
Faster.

78
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,993
Give me the wheel.

79
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,836
Cups and saucers.
- Jam.

80
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,513
Sugar and tea.

81
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,032
Lemon.

82
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,675
Teaspoons and serviettes.
- Milk.

83
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,800
Petit fours.
- And the flowers.

84
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,476
Now what?
- They're here, sergeant.

85
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,470
In the waiting room.
- Stay here.

86
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,830
They're ruining it for us.

87
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,791
Sergeant Gerber. Welcome, ladies.
Chief Cruchot.

88
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,872
Kepi.
- Got it.

89
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,633
Take it off.

90
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,152
Christine Rocourt.

91
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,513
Marianne Bonnet.

92
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,433
Isabelle Leroy.

93
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,038
Yo Macumba.

94
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,716
How did you get here?
- We missed the train.

95
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,110
By plane and by cab.

96
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,597
Sit down. I arranged for
some refreshments.

97
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,754
That was all. Now go.

98
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,758
No, I'll do it.

99
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,871
Dear children, first of all I
want to put your minds at rest..

100
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,990
I hope our collaboration will
be productive and candid.

101
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,752
I'm receiving you very clearly, sergeant.

102
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,031
Here you go, sergeant.

103
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,589
Cruchot, hot. Hot, Cruchot.

104
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,075
Sit down. Sit down and make
yourself very small. Very small.

105
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,233
I hope we're not disturbing?

106
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,796
No, not at all.

107
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,319
We were just welcoming
our young interns.

108
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,189
It will be a lovely work experience.

109
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:11,430
Mrs Cruchot.
And my wife, Mrs Gerber.

110
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,353
The girls are staying with the sisters.

111
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,799
Shall we take them there
then, sergeant?

112
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,956
Of course. So you have time
off until tomorrow morning.

113
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,078
Be here at 7.

114
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,318
The keys... The keys of the...

115
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,992
The keys of the Mehari.

116
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,679
Come change your pants.

117
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,831
Rest well. After you, darling.

118
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,237
So, sweetheart... Been shopping?

119
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,231
I've got a sweater for you.
Enough Playboy style, I hope.

120
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:06,912
Try it on.

121
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,076
Can somebody drive us?

122
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,712
The keys.

123
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,070
Here are the keys.

124
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,631
Ready, girls?

125
00:17:37,999 --> 00:17:42,117
Women in the gendarmerie.
And a black woman too.

126
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:47,347
Josépha, our civilisation is
on its last legs.

127
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:52,312
Could be a new start for you.

128
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:57,877
No, darling. They'll never
get to see the man inside me.

129
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,914
For them, I'll only be their chief
Cruchot. Wait and see.

130
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:12,353
Don't exaggerate. Those girls were
forced on us.

131
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,713
That was an order and orders are
executed. End of discussion.

132
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:21,315
It's not an unpleasant
order, is it?

133
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:24,910
We'll wait and see what they're
worth on the job.

134
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:30,112
Look at what I do.

135
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,754
The car registration.
- But I didn't do anything wrong.

136
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:41,035
Open the boot.

137
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:56,154
I could see right away he was ok.
A matter of experience.

138
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:58,992
Can I try?

139
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,670
Hello, sir. A little check.
Can I see your registration?

140
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,752
My pleasure.

141
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,079
Thank you, that's all.
- Not even a tiny fine?

142
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:25,278
Prevention is better than repression.
Goodbye.

143
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,191
Didn't I do it well?
- I've got a little fly in my eye.

144
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:39,314
Show me.
- Maybe I should... Ah, yes.

145
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:44,793
Right. Yes, there it is.
Yes, that's a lot better.

146
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,189
Yes, a lot better.

147
00:19:56,719 --> 00:19:59,756
Everything ok? Get lost, you.

148
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:03,958
There was a fly in my eye.
It's gone already, chief.

149
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:50,996
And?
- Let's go there.

150
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:58,994
Get lost, you.

151
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,677
Are you ill, old man?

152
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:12,873
I'll give you 5 minutes exactly
to get out of town.

153
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:23,837
Get on, we'll get them out of here.
- Damn, my motorbike.

154
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:41,312
Are you ok?

155
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:52,077
Christine...

156
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:06,195
Come, come. Wait.

157
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:13,912
You have beautiful eyes.

158
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:22,195
Need a hand, Perlin?
- We shook of the gang.

159
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:27,551
No, chief, no.
- To the car. To the car.

160
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,391
Come closer, darlings.
Come closer.

161
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:58,074
Spying on half naked creatures.
You disappoint me, Mr Cruchot.

162
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,917
You're mistaken. My men are
out of line with our girls.

163
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:05,474
Aren't you out of line yourself?

164
00:24:06,439 --> 00:24:10,352
You're possessed by the devil.
- I'm surveying.

165
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:13,432
Honestly?

166
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:16,871
Yes, look for yourself.

167
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:21,590
Do you see filthy Beaupied
with the black woman?

168
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,592
She's a real black.

169
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,671
You see them?
- No, nothing.

170
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:34,798
Wait. No, they're not there anymore.
They're gone.

171
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:38,390
Were here.
- You were there.

172
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:41,719
We just arrived, chief.
- Exactly.

173
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,070
It's the sun, chief.

174
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:50,357
Get a hold. And remember: if you
lie to us, you lie to God.

175
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,996
Come on, sister Thérèse.

176
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:59,028
I'll get you.
You took her paddling, didn't you?

177
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:00,798
What are you talking about?
- Yes, paddling.

178
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,916
What's that?
- Sweat, chief. You're terrorising us.

179
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,391
What a terrible head.
We're going back. Follow me.

180
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:24,472
Now you. Authoritative look,
curt manner...

181
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:27,467
...and smooth transitions. Go on.

182
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,351
That's bit stiff. Wait.

183
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,795
Again, from the start.

184
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:43,277
Chief, what's happening?
Did you do all that?

185
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,468
They're looking at me instead
of the signs.

186
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,149
Why would that be, chief?

187
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:55,557
Attention. Get out of here.

188
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:13,679
Well, I'm buggered.

189
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,599
I can't even go dancing anymore.

190
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:20,749
That Cruchot is really trying to kill us.

191
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,948
They need to go from
theory to practice.

192
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:27,349
Tomorrow, we'll let them
go on their own.

193
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,159
Another glass of wine?
- No, thank you.

194
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:33,790
What are they doing now?
- They're off duty now.

195
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,431
I'm going to have a look in town.
- No, leave them alone.

196
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,956
Go to bed now, go.
- Thank you. Goodnight.

197
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:48,514
I'm going to have a look anyway.

198
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,756
Look, Yo, this was in my bag.

199
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:13,747
Wait for me tonight at 11.
Your future may depend on it.

200
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:15,432
A friend.

201
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,635
Strange, no?
- A gendarme?

202
00:29:17,879 --> 00:29:20,712
What did you think?
- Will you leave your light on?

203
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,519
No, I'm going to sleep.
- For sure?

204
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:30,717
That's him. That's him.

205
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,998
You again.
- Not me, it was the other one.

206
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:42,194
Just like on the beach.
You're misbehaving.

207
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:47,195
Get out. Go.
Scramble.

208
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:51,428
I'll get him.
- And you, to bed. Go.

209
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:11,034
So it was you?
- What? I was what?

210
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:16,439
Naughty boy. Don't pretend you
don't know what I'm on about.

211
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:19,877
Ludovic.

212
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,437
Come up.

213
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,989
Attention. Attention.

214
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:35,991
I see you're still suffering
from Saturday night fever.

215
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:41,072
Nightly visits to
the young ladies.

216
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,195
I should have bought a guitar,
instead of a sweater.

217
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,918
Sweetheart, I can explain everything.

218
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,912
Never mind, I just
saw how you operate.

219
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:57,914
And that girl is sick.
She's a drooling loser.

220
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,756
You think I'm crazy?

221
00:32:04,239 --> 00:32:06,275
You think I'm crazy?
- Yes.

222
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:12,913
Don't lie. Sister Marie-Ange
just called me.

223
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:16,193
You don't know a thing.
But I will soon.

224
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:19,432
Wait for me tonight.

225
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:23,397
Your future may depend on it.

226
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:28,794
Doesn't sound familiar?
- It's been typed on the old machine.

227
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,678
Where is it?
- No idea.

228
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:32,955
You never know anything.

229
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,353
I know, chief.
It's in the basement.

230
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,593
To the basement. To the basement.

231
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:22,118
Ok, go.

232
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,233
Come in.

233
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:38,912
What do you want?

234
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,239
I think this is yours, sergeant.

235
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,670
My wife will sew it back on.
- Your wife?

236
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,514
She went to her sister.
- The sister who...

237
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:01,036
Where did you find that button?
- In the basement.

238
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:06,989
In the basement? What were you doing there?

239
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:12,953
This was typed on the old machine,
by the person who lost this.

240
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:15,432
You're accusing me?

241
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,592
My wife thought I was
there last night.

242
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:23,908
But I was only surveying.

243
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,112
You've been bitten
by the spy virus.

244
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,958
I'd go through fire and water for you,
but now my wife suspects me...

245
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:40,909
Turn yourself in, sergeant.
My marital bliss depends on it.

246
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,557
I understand.
I understand, Cruchot.

247
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:52,788
But I have to admit something too.
I was in a crazy mood.

248
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:59,956
It was a moment of insanity.

249
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:04,995
Cruchot, don't mention it
to Germaine.

250
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,435
I don't think little Ludovic
should pay for it.

251
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:16,869
What if the Big Bear swears
eternal gratitude to Ludovic?

252
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,229
Cruchot, ask me anything.

253
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:28,273
Anything?
- Anything.

254
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,075
Attention.

255
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,636
General.
- At your service, general.

256
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:59,471
Every morning you come recite an
ode to my greatness.

257
00:35:59,879 --> 00:36:03,269
In rhyme.
- It will rhyme, general.

258
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,198
I love you, general.
- I love you, marshal.

259
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,959
I love you, marshal.
- I love you, marshal.

260
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,152
That's it.

261
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:18,830
I'm going for a walk.
- Be careful.

262
00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:21,590
Do you want to take my transmitter?

263
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:29,114
Come on, girls, to bed.

264
00:37:16,759 --> 00:37:22,709
Tonight at 10, Plage des Boucaniers.
I have something to tell you.

265
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:25,873
Don't be afraid. It's something professional.

266
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,511
Glory to you, brave soldier,
bold gendarme.

267
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,034
Your heroism
warms our heart.

268
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:21,154
Your strength is immense
and your courage unique.

269
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,717
We embrace your image,
oh Cruchot Ludovic.

270
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,715
Is that good enough, general?

271
00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:39,388
Did you see Isabelle?
- She disappeared.

272
00:38:39,879 --> 00:38:42,996
We told her:
Don't go on your own.

273
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,429
The place is crawling with lady-killers.

274
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,035
Isabelle Leroy has disappeared.

275
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:58,108
The Mehari was found near
the bay of the Boucaniers.

276
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:02,318
Nobody. Just a handbag.
- Of Isabelle Leroy.

277
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:06,108
Are we leaving the car here,
or do we return it?

278
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:10,108
Search the surroundings.
What should we do, sergeant?

279
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:13,715
Solve this case and
take Yo Macumba with you.

280
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,474
Show her how
professionals work.

281
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,797
And?

282
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:44,190
We found nothing.
- She hasn't evaporated into thin air.

283
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:46,874
She's been kidnapped, that much is clear.

284
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,953
Look here.

285
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:57,749
This is were the trail ends.
There was a fight here.

286
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:00,992
A body has been dragged
to the sea here.

287
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:06,518
Nonsense, all these James Bond
theories. Worthless.

288
00:40:06,879 --> 00:40:08,517
And what about this?

289
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,755
We'll let them think they're
dealing with a maniac.

290
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:46,110
We have to distract them.
They can't look our way.

291
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:51,434
We've got the first piece of
the puzzle. Don't rush it.

292
00:40:51,759 --> 00:40:56,116
First we need to have
all the elements.

293
00:40:57,879 --> 00:40:59,392
Do whatever's necessary.

294
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:47,432
Did everything go well?

295
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:51,513
A sailor invited me to his yacht.

296
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,796
The womanisers.
- Let's pick up Marianne.

297
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:08,073
Where did she go?
- Marianne.

298
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,636
Was it here?
- This is were we dropped her off.

299
00:42:35,799 --> 00:42:37,357
Look.

300
00:42:40,799 --> 00:42:46,112
To think they trusted us
with those girls.

301
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:49,989
And two in a row get stolen.

302
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:54,474
They didn't really disappear.

303
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:59,994
They're making fools of us.
- Are you seasick or something?

304
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:04,792
It's in your interest to
find them quickly.

305
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:10,513
If the colonel hears about this, we'll be
transferred to Maubeuge.

306
00:43:10,759 --> 00:43:14,115
Or to the Kerguelen islands.
Do you know them?

307
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:20,198
I assure you that's not something
I look forward to.

308
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:25,358
Come in. Do you know where the
Kerguelen islands are?

309
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,558
What is it?
- This came with the mail, sergeant.

310
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:43,636
They were so cute in their
little uniforms. Don't look for them.

311
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:49,074
Don't say a word to anybody,
or you'll never see them again. The Brain.

312
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:52,508
The Brain. Damn.

313
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:08,392
Sergeant, the colonel's coming.

314
00:44:08,799 --> 00:44:12,394
The colonel.
Not a word from anybody.

315
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:18,389
Get to work. As is nothing
happened. Get to work.

316
00:44:22,879 --> 00:44:24,312
Colonel.

317
00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:27,034
How are the interns doing?

318
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,589
Very well, colonel.
- Good.

319
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:34,356
At the end of the week, the
minister will come to inspect.

320
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:38,915
Prepare to receive him
with all your people.

321
00:44:39,959 --> 00:44:42,189
That's bad timing, colonel.

322
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,032
Why?

323
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,874
August is such a busy month.

324
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:55,549
That's a detail. Now I'd like to
meet the young ladies.

325
00:44:57,279 --> 00:45:00,794
Well, colonel,
this morning one was...

326
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:05,472
Come along, colonel.

327
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,512
Attention.

328
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:13,712
At ease.

329
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:20,231
As you can see, the young ladies
have integrated very well.

330
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:24,637
Gentlemen, to your sector.
Leave us alone.

331
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:37,835
Ladies, happy
with your daily work here?

332
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:40,998
Introduce yourselves
and tell me your impressions.

333
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:46,231
Christine Rocourt. Very happy.

334
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:51,036
Aren't you Yo Macumba?
- Yes, colonel.

335
00:45:51,759 --> 00:45:54,512
You have no complaints,
I hope?

336
00:45:54,759 --> 00:45:57,796
No. We're sharing the risk
with the men.

337
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:06,237
Don't let them take too much risk.
I told you that, didn't I?

338
00:46:06,479 --> 00:46:09,039
Also, don't bury them in paperwork.

339
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:13,870
Let them develop their own
initiative, but cautiously.

340
00:46:14,279 --> 00:46:16,031
Ay you wish, colonel.

341
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:22,552
In spite of all precautions,
accidents are always possible.

342
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,110
No. If that happens, you're out.

343
00:46:26,599 --> 00:46:28,749
Where are the other two?

344
00:46:29,799 --> 00:46:34,429
Weren't there four of them?
- Four, right?

345
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:39,553
One plus one is two.
Plus two is four, indeed.

346
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:41,232
There they are.
- Where?

347
00:46:41,479 --> 00:46:44,596
At the intersection.
They're controlling the traffic.

348
00:46:44,999 --> 00:46:48,036
Between Maubeuge
and the Kerguelen islands.

349
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:54,197
No, at intersection 6, colonel.
A very complicated intersection.

350
00:46:54,439 --> 00:46:56,270
Let's go and look. Is it far?

351
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:01,838
Yes. If you include the detour,
it takes an hour...

352
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:06,950
Two. Two hours, colonel.
Solve this or I explode.

353
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:14,115
Isn't that a bummer, chief?

354
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:17,593
Maubeuge isn't so bad.

355
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:24,679
Sweethearts. Come with me.
Come on, go upstairs. Quick, quick.

356
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:33,956
Undress. That's an order.
Give me your clothes.

357
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:39,356
If it's an order...
- Better do it.

358
00:47:40,879 --> 00:47:45,907
Right. And the rest.
Perfect.

359
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:38,708
You're ignoring stop signs.
- I didn't see that.

360
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:42,470
No, please,
we're on holiday.

361
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:47,517
I'll let you get away with it,
but on one condition. Come along.

362
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,437
Time for the bottle.

363
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:06,313
Put this on. No questions.
Your girlfriend too.

364
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:09,392
That's my husband.
- Yes, my name is Georges.

365
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:15,627
Don't worry. We'll take a shortcut
and we'll get there.

366
00:49:16,279 --> 00:49:21,831
We've taken shortcuts for 45 minutes
and we're not getting anywhere...

367
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:24,797
It takes very long to get there.

368
00:49:25,439 --> 00:49:28,078
Some shortcuts are really long.

369
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:33,278
Gerber, do we have far to go?
- I said two hours, colonel.

370
00:49:37,399 --> 00:49:42,348
I think we're going in circles.
- Everybody can see that, colonel.

371
00:49:49,279 --> 00:49:51,429
You'd better find them.

372
00:49:54,039 --> 00:49:55,950
Hello, Delta 3.

373
00:49:56,999 --> 00:50:01,151
We're coming. They're at the intersection
of the Three Farms.

374
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,430
Why did you move?

375
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:42,830
They're showing initiative,
colonel.

376
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:45,547
Let them talk. Or are they mutes?

377
00:50:46,279 --> 00:50:48,315
Who is Isabelle Leroy?
- She is.

378
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:51,713
I knew a horseman in Saumur.

379
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:57,830
Then that's not a relative of mine.
My father is a butcher, colonel.

380
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:03,433
Marianne Bonnet. Her father was
sub lieutenant with the alpine hunters.

381
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:05,198
She has a vocation.

382
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:09,871
Mama and I love
handsome men in uniform.

383
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:12,474
Men like you, colonel.

384
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:17,952
You have such class.
- It's getting late, colonel.

385
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,917
Gerber, don't interrupt the lady.

386
00:51:41,999 --> 00:51:46,948
What are you doing with that child?
- It was abandoned.

387
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:50,596
Maybe by a woman
with no means.

388
00:51:50,839 --> 00:51:53,876
Give it to me.
You're holding it wrong.

389
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:02,228
Take it from me.
Bring it to a care centre or something.

390
00:52:08,999 --> 00:52:11,467
They get along well.

391
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:15,115
Careful, Gerber.
No ethical problems in the family.

392
00:52:20,999 --> 00:52:25,038
Now call the other two.
- You already saw them.

393
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:26,917
I want to see them again.

394
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:32,115
Cruchot, go get them.
- Get them.

395
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:22,789
They can't be long.

396
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:25,952
Do you never know where they are?

397
00:53:27,759 --> 00:53:29,317
Come here, you.
- Ma'am.

398
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,633
Excuse me, colonel.

399
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:36,112
Hurry. Hurry. Come on.

400
00:53:39,439 --> 00:53:42,158
You need two?
- Two what?

401
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:44,829
Two half naked girls in our room.

402
00:53:45,799 --> 00:53:49,633
I'll get him for that, just wait.

403
00:53:49,879 --> 00:53:52,951
Who are you talking about?
Don't lie or I'll scream.

404
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,594
You're obsessed.
- It's for Sacrament day.

405
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,353
Quick. Quick.

406
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:31,112
That way.

407
00:54:34,799 --> 00:54:38,030
Stay here.
Don't make it any harder.

408
00:54:41,279 --> 00:54:45,033
Did you see my husband?
- He's very busy.

409
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:55,758
Well, I'll be...! I'll kill him.
I'll kill myself.

410
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,119
And I want a divorce.

411
00:55:27,279 --> 00:55:31,158
Excuse me, madam. Have you been back long?

412
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:38,471
Had a good trip?

413
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,476
The arrival wasn't so good.

414
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:47,993
They're at your place.
- My place? Oh no.

415
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:49,672
Oh yes.
- No.

416
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,353
Yes.
- No.

417
00:56:03,399 --> 00:56:05,754
Do we need reinforcements?

418
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:08,599
Honey, I can explain everything.

419
00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:11,478
Who told them to undress?

420
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:13,992
He did.
- He did.

421
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:17,675
I'll get you.
- And you'll do anything for it.

422
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:21,878
The boat's sinking. We're drowning.
Get dressed quickly.

423
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:24,679
You too, sweetheart.
- Shut up or I'll bite.

424
00:56:24,959 --> 00:56:30,591
After his inspection here, the minister
will receive the president of Boungawa.

425
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:33,478
Do you know that president's name?

426
00:56:34,839 --> 00:56:36,272
Leopold Macumba.

427
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:40,468
So our negro... our black...
- His daughter.

428
00:56:41,759 --> 00:56:44,910
She didn't say anything because
she didn't want any favouritism.

429
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:49,598
How admirable of her.
- So we have to keep a close eye on her.

430
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:54,950
There they are.
- Finally.

431
00:56:57,079 --> 00:57:00,435
Ladies, it was a bit early to let
you go out on the streets alone.

432
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:06,353
And I want to talk
to you in private.

433
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:16,318
Arrange everything for the
official visit at the end of the week.

434
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:25,749
So everything turned out alright.
Thanks to whom?

435
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:29,238
Thanks to me, Gerber.
- Attention.

436
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:35,910
Yo Macumba is the daughter
of the president of Boungawa.

437
00:57:36,999 --> 00:57:41,629
Thanks to your little schemes, we
nearly had a catastrophe on our hands.

438
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:44,519
My wife almost killed me.

439
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:49,994
So enough with your attitude.
Understood, Cruchot?

440
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,438
Attention.
- At your service, general.

441
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:57,352
Damn.
- Damn.

442
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:03,317
If you need something,
ask me directly.

443
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:07,199
This is my private number.

444
00:58:08,399 --> 00:58:10,151
How nice, colonel.

445
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:14,510
Only for you and your female
colleagues.

446
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:16,949
For when they need advice.

447
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:32,558
So we're two short.

448
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:36,718
We can't lose the
remaining two.

449
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:42,358
Especially the black one.
I trust you with her.

450
00:58:44,359 --> 00:58:47,351
Each to their own, Cruchot.

451
00:58:47,959 --> 00:58:50,792
Let's not let them
go out of our sight.

452
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,191
As you wish, sergeant.

453
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:58,676
Come in. What do you want?

454
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:03,271
You have been able to
hide the truth from the colonel.

455
00:59:03,919 --> 00:59:06,149
But how are you
going to find them?

456
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:11,433
You have an idea, don't you?
- More than one.

457
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:15,033
I have to go now. See you later.

458
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:19,316
See you later. No, wait,
I'll go with you.

459
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:39,870
Where are you going?
- To the pharmacy.

460
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:53,156
Corypol eye drops... I sell these
very rarely.

461
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:57,235
Shall I order them for you?
- No, never mind.

462
00:59:59,319 --> 01:00:00,957
Twelve francs, sir.

463
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,393
A beer for me.

464
01:00:32,399 --> 01:00:34,230
You have a very nice boat.

465
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:38,357
Why do you moor so
far from the harbour?

466
01:00:39,159 --> 01:00:42,913
Do you want to see it?
- I love boats and sailors.

467
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,237
Some of them, that is.

468
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:50,639
After work... If I had a date
with somebody like you...

469
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:53,590
I'd arrive 5 minutes early.

470
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:57,148
Keep the uniform.
Why not right now?

471
01:00:57,399 --> 01:01:00,038
Ok. I have to make a
phone call first.

472
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:17,552
Yes, of course. I'll put her on.

473
01:01:17,879 --> 01:01:19,312
Miss Macumba...

474
01:01:24,199 --> 01:01:29,432
Hello? Yes. What's happening?
- Remember Isabelle's eye drops?

475
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:33,595
They don't sell them often.

476
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:38,390
I'm here with the man who just
bought them at the pharmacy...

477
01:01:38,839 --> 01:01:41,717
Christine. Hello? She's gone.

478
01:01:42,959 --> 01:01:46,998
Where are you going?
- To Christine, the harbour.

479
01:02:04,999 --> 01:02:09,151
Was there a young police woman here?
- There, near the phone.

480
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:21,188
Her address book.
The number of the gendarmerie.

481
01:02:25,639 --> 01:02:28,312
Miss Rocourt.
Miss Rocourt.

482
01:02:34,999 --> 01:02:38,230
Where is Christine?
- I only found this.

483
01:02:38,479 --> 01:02:40,435
I go this way,
you go that way.

484
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,756
And I go that way.
- Yes. No.

485
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:49,150
Stay with her. If you lose her,
we can commit hara-kiri.

486
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:05,158
Where's the closest beach?
- That way.

487
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:28,195
Miss Macumba.

488
01:03:41,079 --> 01:03:43,718
Miss Macumba.

489
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:54,510
Her purse...

490
01:03:59,759 --> 01:04:02,432
Sergeant...

491
01:04:04,599 --> 01:04:11,152
No, sergeant. Don't lose
courage now. We have to act.

492
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,119
I've had it. I'm calling the colonel.

493
01:04:19,479 --> 01:04:21,834
Hello? Yes, it's me.

494
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:27,634
What? Why?

495
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:30,232
I'm coming.

496
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:41,077
There he comes.

497
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:45,072
Attention.

498
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:49,555
Gerber.

499
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:53,154
You've made a fool out of me.

500
01:04:54,039 --> 01:05:00,228
You get to train four girls and
you let them be kidnapped.

501
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:05,109
Not enough manpower.
- You want to report a missing person?

502
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:09,432
And the worst thing about it is
the black one. A disaster.

503
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,710
If president Macumba
hears about this...

504
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:19,112
Do you know how much
oil he provides?

505
01:05:19,759 --> 01:05:23,308
You're going to find the girls.
And without a car.

506
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,237
Take your bike, like
in the old days.

507
01:05:29,319 --> 01:05:31,435
You'll get an idea what
life is like without oil.

508
01:06:32,999 --> 01:06:37,038
Remember the young police woman
who came to make a phone call?

509
01:06:37,279 --> 01:06:40,112
Did anyone here talk to her?

510
01:06:40,759 --> 01:06:44,229
Yes, a sailor.
- From which yacht?

511
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:49,917
Which yacht? You know,
there are many boats here.

512
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:54,472
We'll search them one
by one if we have to...

513
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:03,628
Olsen speaking. They want to
search all the boats.

514
01:07:03,959 --> 01:07:06,598
There's one thing missing.

515
01:07:07,159 --> 01:07:10,993
We have to find it.
Scare them in the meantime.

516
01:07:11,279 --> 01:07:12,837
But don't go too far.

517
01:07:35,759 --> 01:07:39,718
That knife almost got me.
- And what about the geranium.

518
01:07:39,959 --> 01:07:44,191
We're making progress.
The Brain wants to scare us.

519
01:07:46,439 --> 01:07:49,670
What's that? What's that?

520
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:55,873
Stop searching, or they'll
all die. The Brain.

521
01:07:58,839 --> 01:08:02,673
Germaine. Germaine.
- Josépha. Josépha.

522
01:08:03,399 --> 01:08:05,754
Germaine. Germaine...

523
01:08:08,679 --> 01:08:11,034
What's happening?
- You're still there.

524
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:14,235
Germaine.
- She's not here.

525
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:21,633
Don't go outside, no matter what.

526
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,670
Stay inside, that's an order.

527
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:32,795
Ludovic, what's wrong with you?

528
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:37,427
The wife of the sergeant. Why?

529
01:08:37,999 --> 01:08:40,559
The fourth girl didn't have a bracelet.

530
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,030
The sergeant's wife might have one.

531
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:47,716
But they told us:
only the girls in uniform.

532
01:08:48,119 --> 01:08:53,147
Who's wearing the last bracelet?
Maybe a new gendarmette.

533
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:56,075
We have to find her. Quickly.

534
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,717
And now my wife. This is really too much.

535
01:09:13,159 --> 01:09:15,593
My little Germaine...

536
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:19,716
I'm sure they won't hurt
her, sergeant.

537
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:22,753
My little Germaine...

538
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:28,876
We have to strike, sergeant.
- Set a trap.

539
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:33,911
We have to lure them with
a woman in uniform.

540
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:38,474
There are no more women.
All four of them are gone.

541
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,869
And now poor Mrs Gerber too.

542
01:09:43,159 --> 01:09:46,196
But still. Still.

543
01:09:48,039 --> 01:09:52,874
Think hard.
- I do, but I come up with nothing.

544
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,351
Think harder.

545
01:09:56,479 --> 01:09:58,435
Oh no. Not Josépha.

546
01:09:59,759 --> 01:10:01,192
Not Josépha.

547
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:06,431
Cruchot, now is the moment.

548
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:12,550
Have her put on a uniform.
That's an order.

549
01:10:20,999 --> 01:10:24,958
I have to help arrest the maniac.

550
01:10:25,599 --> 01:10:27,794
It would be criminal to refuse.

551
01:10:28,039 --> 01:10:32,191
Take this bag too. And this.
Details are important.

552
01:10:32,439 --> 01:10:33,872
Ready?
- At your service.

553
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:40,396
If anything happens to her, I'll
eat your liver wrapped in bacon.

554
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:47,398
In five minutes you go out
alone and follow this route.

555
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:50,434
Cruchot. Where is Cruchot?

556
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:53,633
Cruchot, you wait for her here.

557
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:57,555
I hate you.
- We'll keep an eye on you.

558
01:10:57,839 --> 01:11:00,990
I'll put men on all
strategic locations.

559
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:05,230
I forbid you.
- Do you have a better idea?

560
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:06,555
Yes.

561
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:20,708
Fig Tree here.
Take over, Lemon Plant.

562
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:25,438
Lemon Plant here.
I'm not losing sight of her.

563
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:51,352
Lemon Plant and Almond Tree.
She's being followed.

564
01:12:13,639 --> 01:12:15,391
She defends herself well.

565
01:12:15,639 --> 01:12:19,473
Papa Cruchot isn't wearing
the pants at home.

566
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:31,548
A new one, with a bracelet. I
wanted to grab her, but I failed.

567
01:12:32,359 --> 01:12:34,315
It stinks of police here.

568
01:12:42,559 --> 01:12:45,596
Raspberry Bush,
she's coming your way.

569
01:12:47,719 --> 01:12:49,152
Understood.

570
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:09,909
Hello Sugar Cane, Raspberry Bush here.
Your wife is coming by here now.

571
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:22,032
Where did she go?

572
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,157
The bracelet.
The last part of the code.

573
01:13:32,919 --> 01:13:36,275
Not exactly Miss Universe.
Oh no, a transvestite.

574
01:13:36,559 --> 01:13:39,596
A gendarme.
Lock him with the girls.

575
01:13:40,279 --> 01:13:43,669
You let them eat the bait.

576
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:46,429
And where's Cruchot now?

577
01:13:50,119 --> 01:13:51,552
What are you doing here?

578
01:13:53,239 --> 01:13:55,673
What? Is that you?

579
01:13:56,679 --> 01:14:00,433
We followed you all night,
in uniform.

580
01:14:01,759 --> 01:14:04,512
Ludovic went in my place.

581
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:08,436
Where is he?
- So that wasn't you back there?

582
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:12,668
We'll find him.
- Has he been kidnapped too?

583
01:14:13,039 --> 01:14:16,031
That's what happens when
you don't obey orders.

584
01:14:17,159 --> 01:14:19,798
Find him, quickly. This is taking too long.

585
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:23,918
Or I'll activate the contingency plan.

586
01:14:24,679 --> 01:14:27,716
But what do they want?
- Our bracelets.

587
01:14:27,999 --> 01:14:29,557
Not mine.

588
01:14:29,879 --> 01:14:33,428
Who kidnaps five women
for their bracelets?

589
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:38,349
You. Come here. Quick.
- No, leave him here.

590
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:52,877
Hello, Mr Cruchot.

591
01:14:53,399 --> 01:14:56,835
Your computer has some
interesting information.

592
01:14:57,319 --> 01:15:01,073
If you have a code of 16 digits.

593
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:05,676
Four digits engraved in four
bracelets, that's...

594
01:15:07,639 --> 01:15:10,995
Sixteen digits.
Is that why you kidnapped them?

595
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:15,199
All four bracelets have been made
on different locations.

596
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:17,589
The girls didn't know a thing about it.

597
01:15:17,839 --> 01:15:21,673
Well keep the bracelets and
return the women to me.

598
01:15:21,959 --> 01:15:25,315
First, I want to test the code.
Without witnesses.

599
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:27,198
And before the minister arrives.

600
01:15:27,639 --> 01:15:30,278
You want the gendarmerie empty?
- For one hour.

601
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:33,796
And don't warn anybody,
or the ladies...

602
01:15:34,439 --> 01:15:37,476
Will I get them back right away?
- Promise.

603
01:15:54,559 --> 01:15:59,110
My son. You're walking around in
womens' clothes now.

604
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:03,718
Such devilish fantasies.
- The nation is in danger.

605
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:51,710
Finally. We've been looking
for you all night.

606
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,678
Where were you?
What happened to you?

607
01:16:56,079 --> 01:17:00,914
I've forgotten everything.
I woke up under an olive tree.

608
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:04,675
You made our last operation fail.

609
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:08,510
But he did go in my place.

610
01:17:09,319 --> 01:17:11,992
A beautiful gesture, isn't it?

611
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,277
Our women are still missing.

612
01:17:16,119 --> 01:17:19,316
I don't care.
- It will be alright.

613
01:17:20,599 --> 01:17:23,636
Off to mass, you.
- I'm not a catholic.

614
01:17:23,879 --> 01:17:25,915
Go get baptised then.

615
01:17:26,839 --> 01:17:28,272
And the three of you...

616
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:32,877
Go with him and bring two
jerry cans of holy water each.

617
01:17:36,919 --> 01:17:40,070
Will that help find them?
- God promised.

618
01:17:45,839 --> 01:17:48,672
And you, Josépha,
go get some groceries.

619
01:17:48,999 --> 01:17:51,354
Groceries.
- I already did.

620
01:17:51,599 --> 01:17:54,989
Go back.
- What do you need?

621
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,312
Three melons.

622
01:18:03,399 --> 01:18:08,154
What does all of this mean?
Should I get some candy?

623
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:13,712
It's five to. Get me six packs
of tobacco in Cogolin.

624
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:18,317
Why in Cogolin?
- It's better there. The microclimate.

625
01:18:18,559 --> 01:18:21,915
How will the tobacco help?

626
01:18:22,319 --> 01:18:27,871
Don't ask me to explain, trust me,
in the name of France.

627
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,959
And the women?
- Outside, in the car.

628
01:19:22,199 --> 01:19:23,632
After delivery.

629
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:50,469
Send him away.

630
01:19:55,839 --> 01:19:58,069
What's wrong?
- They stole my...

631
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:00,753
They motored my stole bike.

632
01:20:00,999 --> 01:20:04,548
And what can I do about that?
- Arrest the thief.

633
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:09,795
I'm not on duty.
- Then I want to file a complaint.

634
01:20:10,559 --> 01:20:12,789
There's nobody here.
- No.

635
01:20:13,239 --> 01:20:14,672
I see somebody.
- The cat.

636
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:19,511
She's furious. She bit me.
I'm contagious.

637
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:29,592
Done. I've got them.

638
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:32,592
Right, come on.

639
01:20:41,999 --> 01:20:43,557
Here they are.
- Thank you.

640
01:20:45,599 --> 01:20:49,035
My women.
- Get in, Mr Cruchot.

641
01:20:49,639 --> 01:20:51,595
You gave me your word.

642
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:58,309
Mr Cruchot, you're so naive.

643
01:20:58,959 --> 01:21:00,392
What do you mean?

644
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:05,388
We now have the plans for
the XZ missiles...

645
01:21:05,959 --> 01:21:09,190
...that you want to install
on the Lérins Islands.

646
01:21:09,759 --> 01:21:12,432
And some information about Larzac.

647
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:18,588
But you and your gendarmettes
now know way too much.

648
01:21:19,839 --> 01:21:23,912
And we definitely have
to eliminate that risk.

649
01:21:34,479 --> 01:21:38,438
I'd be surprised if they
let us go after all this.

650
01:21:38,679 --> 01:21:41,113
What did they do to Cruchot?

651
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:44,795
The same they'll do to us.

652
01:21:45,239 --> 01:21:49,198
Let's make ourselves look
pretty for the Lord then.

653
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:53,870
That's not my purse,
it's yours, Yo.

654
01:21:58,159 --> 01:22:01,117
Thank God, we still have a chance.

655
01:22:02,519 --> 01:22:05,670
Your famous transmitter.
Is it strong enough?

656
01:22:05,919 --> 01:22:08,956
Enough to reach some radio amateurs.

657
01:22:09,559 --> 01:22:12,995
You can try it,
but it might be too late.

658
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:20,792
Stupid.

659
01:22:21,519 --> 01:22:24,317
Yo Macumba.
Inform the gendarmerie.

660
01:22:24,959 --> 01:22:29,111
We're imprisoned and in
mortal danger on the Albacora.

661
01:22:45,484 --> 01:22:46,950
Fortunately, I know the shortcuts.

662
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:23,912
Darn.

663
01:23:29,519 --> 01:23:32,079
Thank you, Lord. Very nice of you.

664
01:24:21,119 --> 01:24:23,110
Yes, I'm coming.

665
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,156
Careful. Wait. Take it easy.

666
01:24:40,399 --> 01:24:42,788
Free your legs. Like that.

667
01:24:43,999 --> 01:24:47,833
I just heard an SOS from
the gendarmettes.

668
01:24:48,079 --> 01:24:50,229
In mortal danger on the Albacora.

669
01:24:50,879 --> 01:24:53,712
They're asking for help. Quickly.
- Let's go.

670
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:00,632
Don't push me.

671
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:06,309
Why did they kidnap us?

672
01:25:06,559 --> 01:25:11,314
The secret code of the computer
was engraved in your bracelets.

673
01:25:11,559 --> 01:25:16,587
Now we're lost.
- Yo sent an SOS.

674
01:25:21,759 --> 01:25:23,989
I understand their secrecy.

675
01:25:24,959 --> 01:25:30,875
The machine knows more state secrets
than all intelligence services combined.

676
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:35,909
And now we sell
to the highest bidder.

677
01:25:36,359 --> 01:25:39,590
Shall we get rid of
our guests?

678
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:41,832
Why not.

679
01:25:55,839 --> 01:25:59,275
The rope? The knife? The gun?

680
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:03,116
The sea is deep and the fish are hungry.

681
01:26:03,479 --> 01:26:06,869
I want to be killed first.
- Alright.

682
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:14,433
And you can all
make a last wish.

683
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:22,147
I want to spend my final
moments in a man's arms.

684
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:38,634
I want to enjoy one more time...
- That would be my dearest wish too.

685
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:48,389
Don't defile your uniforms.

686
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:50,512
We'll take them off.

687
01:26:52,199 --> 01:26:53,917
I forbid you.

688
01:26:54,439 --> 01:26:58,591
For me it's different.
I'm wearing civilian clothes.

689
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,479
The old woman stays here.
- You're rude.

690
01:27:02,119 --> 01:27:06,271
She's a beautiful, seductive lady.

691
01:27:09,759 --> 01:27:15,948
Now you tell me that, Mr Cruchot,
now that we have so little time left.

692
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:21,072
We're lost.
- Keep it together, dear friend.

693
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:24,470
Who could have imagined?

694
01:27:25,159 --> 01:27:26,592
Certainly not the sergeant.

695
01:27:27,199 --> 01:27:29,429
Why were you always so reserved?

696
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:34,833
Because of Josépha, the sergeant...
Our futures were already planned.

697
01:27:35,519 --> 01:27:37,077
Now they converge.

698
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:42,630
Forever?
Yes. Feel how my heart beats.

699
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:45,717
At least 110.

700
01:27:46,559 --> 01:27:50,188
You're in violation. The limit is 75.

701
01:27:50,839 --> 01:27:52,795
I'm going to fine you.

702
01:27:53,999 --> 01:27:57,628
Come on, Ludovic,
give me a little bit of love.

703
01:27:58,759 --> 01:28:01,592
Allow me to call you Josépha then.

704
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:26,027
How nice of you to show up after all.
- You only have to take this.

705
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:28,151
Where's my wife?
- There.

706
01:29:30,759 --> 01:29:32,909
Will you join us for a drink?

707
01:29:34,039 --> 01:29:35,711
Gentlemen...

708
01:29:45,799 --> 01:29:47,232
Cruchot.

709
01:29:47,479 --> 01:29:48,912
Sergeant.

710
01:29:49,159 --> 01:29:50,638
Germaine.

711
01:29:52,959 --> 01:29:55,519
Alphonse, I knew you'd come.

712
01:29:57,919 --> 01:30:03,198
Apparently, you get along very well.
I demand an explanation.

713
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:08,116
The air-conditioning was broken.
Death was near. Freezing cold.

714
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:13,315
A bit of warmth among friends.
A beautiful, pure friendship.

715
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:18,751
The gendarmerie...
- Enough. I want the truth.

716
01:30:19,559 --> 01:30:25,350
Why did you send me to Cogolin
for six packs of tobacco?

717
01:30:43,799 --> 01:30:48,236
Congratulations, colonel.
The girls were in good hands.

718
01:30:48,519 --> 01:30:52,797
There were risks,
but I could rely on them.

719
01:30:53,519 --> 01:30:56,477
Can I talk to you for a moment, Excellency?

720
01:30:57,359 --> 01:31:00,510
Am I interrupting?
- It's confidential, colonel.

721
01:31:02,039 --> 01:31:07,989
Outrageous. I bet they'll start
a union soon, pompous prigs.

722
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:14,592
Excellency, somebody stole
our computer secrets.

723
01:31:14,879 --> 01:31:18,792
Fortunately, we caught him.

724
01:31:25,639 --> 01:31:27,595
We've known about him for a long time.

725
01:31:27,999 --> 01:31:32,231
We set him up with false
information about the code...

726
01:31:32,599 --> 01:31:34,032
...and he bought it.

727
01:31:34,279 --> 01:31:39,114
But minister, does that mean
it was all rigged?

728
01:31:39,559 --> 01:31:41,789
It was extremely
dangerous, you know.

729
01:31:42,039 --> 01:31:45,395
You did a good job again.

730
01:31:45,719 --> 01:31:48,279
Continue celebrating your victory.

731
01:31:59,839 --> 01:32:03,593
If the girls find out
how we've been had.

732
01:32:04,039 --> 01:32:09,477
But no, sergeant. We're
only cogs in the machine.

733
01:32:49,639 --> 01:32:54,269
The girls should walk ahead.
- We know what we're talking about.

734
01:32:54,519 --> 01:32:57,158
Long live the female gendarmes.

735
01:32:58,520 --> 01:32:59,873
Bullshit.

736
01:33:00,039 --> 01:33:04,669
They're ambitious, Cruchot.
- We'll get them, sergeant.
