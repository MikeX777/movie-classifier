1
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:09,806
THE WAY SOUTH

2
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,291
I leave my home In whatpeople call
a moderate cllmate.

3
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,196
The sulklng wolffrom the North
watches me go.

4
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,969
My sons are growlng up.

5
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,438
I am a man, It seems...

6
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,439
journeylng In my mlnd
when I'm standlng stlll.

7
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,542
Marklng tlme when I'm movlng.

8
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,614
I go from face to face.

9
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,717
In the slush of overproductlon,
dlsdaln...

10
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,754
madness and proflt-maklng.

11
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:01,427
I know
that even those who want to dle...

12
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,829
would rather live.

13
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,097
I belleve...

14
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:08,098
that everybody would Ilke to eat.

15
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:22,512
30 Aprll, Amsterdã.
The squat on Klnker street corner.

16
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:29,052
At flrst we fllmed In black
and whlte, llI at ease, nervous.

17
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,357
Tense about what was golng to happen.

18
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:05,422
No accommodation, no coronation!

19
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:23,206
There are going to be bands soon
and theatre groups.

20
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:28,211
There's going to be beer
and a stage.

21
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,149
Everything. Alcohol and all you need
for a party.

22
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:35,385
You're there, the house is there.

23
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,524
Form a chain.

24
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:02,245
Down with the riot squad!

25
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,347
Dlsperse or else we'll be forced
to use vlolence. Get out ofour way.

26
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,963
Llne up agaln. There's relnforcement
for the slde streets.

27
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,470
There was also a coronatlon that day.

28
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,640
The ellte puts the people's feathers
In thelr caps.

29
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,978
Ifonly that could stop.

30
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:23,586
The squatters still need
all sorts of things.

31
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,857
Mattresses, blankets,
camp beds, furniture...

32
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,928
radios...

33
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,929
toilet paper, cutlery, plates,
mugs...

34
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,433
If you have any of those,
please bring them to us...

35
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,971
so that we can use them.

36
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,972
Thanks a lot.

37
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,684
The city council is going to say
that they're not the owners.

38
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,522
That the squatters must contact
the owner...

39
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,893
and if he isn't planning...

40
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,894
to evict them straight away...

41
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,166
they should try to get him to sell
it to them for a reasonable price.

42
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,474
That's the first thing. Secondly...

43
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:21,778
we must come up with a plan...

44
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:24,914
or at least cooperate
in developing a plan...

45
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,687
for redevelopment.

46
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,688
Then there's the reconstruction itself.

47
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:35,024
I think it's fine to try that...

48
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:38,027
but we should now
be doing our own restructuring.

49
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,399
The architect only calculated
the cost of the materials.

50
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,537
He expected us
to do the work ourselves.

51
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,538
We must get in touch with people
who have done this before.

52
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,576
I helped friends with the conversion
for another group.

53
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,614
We should get them involved
as soon as possible to help.

54
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:02,051
But we must also apply
political pressure...

55
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,625
perhaps through friends
we have in local politics...

56
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,626
to find out
what the owner plans to do.

57
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,197
I'd like to round this point off.
You've all got things to do.

58
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,635
The legal help we get is free.

59
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,738
At number 53
they need metal bedsprings...

60
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,611
to use for barricading.

61
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,612
Bring anything you can find.

62
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,583
Beams of up to two metres long.

63
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,557
What do those metal bars look like?

64
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,559
With a 90-degree angle...

65
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,560
and holes to fasten them
to the walls.

66
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,629
I was wondering how we could get
very thick wire mesh...

67
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,066
like they use on the windows
of the riot squad vans.

68
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,271
We could rip it off and use it
in front of our own windows.

69
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:01,177
Screw it down on the inside.

70
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:04,214
The grid is too fine to put your hand
through and unscrew it on the inside.

71
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:09,052
The barricades must be really strong.
It's so easy to knock in the window.

72
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:13,756
Are there two volunteers
to do it before dinner?

73
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:18,027
I'll do it.

74
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,164
You promised you were going to cook.
- Ah, yes, that's right.

75
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,668
You? Can you two do it together?

76
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,741
Then there's the list
to be on patrol.

77
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,410
Hands up for patrolling tomorrow.

78
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:35,411
One, two... three, four... six.

79
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,584
Seven.
- At the door, from nine onwards.

80
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,088
I'll do tonight.
- Tonight as well for you?

81
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:48,224
All night?
- If there's no other volunteer.

82
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,062
No, no, no.

83
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,231
He's still new to it.

84
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:56,232
Put him on the list for three hours.

85
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,373
Twelve to three?

86
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,109
Have you got a job?
- No.

87
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,110
Ah, you can lie in.

88
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:10,346
In that case you can be on patrol
all night.

89
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,951
How long would you like to do?
- Midnight till six.

90
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,989
Got it.

91
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,602
LONG LIVE 1st MAY

92
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,583
FOR PEACE AND SECURITY

93
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:28,391
Down with the riot squad!

94
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,808
4 May. Remembrance Day
for the World War II dead.

95
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
I joined for very personal reasons.

96
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,856
Not as a result
of a histórical analysis.

97
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,462
It's more because...

98
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,463
your housing situation is terrible
and you see the same all around you.

99
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,004
It's the same for lots of people.

100
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,005
And by talking to people
or by reading about it...

101
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,309
or because you get to know
people in a squat...

102
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,582
you take the step...

103
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:08,424
to be active in a movement
that works for a lot of people.

104
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,895
It's at the same time the solution
of your own housing problem.

105
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,568
If the city policies
are so sluggish...

106
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,569
that we have to wait forever,
we take the initiative ourselves.

107
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,242
But then you've got
your first problem...

108
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,243
with democracy, because you bypass
the system that there is.

109
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:34,016
But the existing system
for the distribution of housing...

110
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:38,289
is inadequate.

111
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,290
You can either wait an eternity,
quietly...

112
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,694
until you can live normally...

113
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,131
or join a group, a large group
of people who are prepared...

114
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,372
to take things
into their own hands.

115
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:57,373
If there was enough housing
there'd be no squatters.

116
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,710
But the authorities aren't
addressing the problem...

117
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,016
so we're forced to.

118
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:08,017
The authorities have lost the power
to do anything about it.

119
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,922
Or that's what they keep saying.

120
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,726
We think that they can do something.
There's so much vacant office space.

121
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,465
These buildings aren't used while
so many people could live there.

122
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,805
Exactly. But the authorities
pretend to be powerless...

123
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,942
while they grant one planning
permit after another for offices.

124
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,215
It's the opposite of powerlessness.

125
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:40,216
It's a choice against people
needing accommodation.

126
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,320
That's the only way to look at it.

127
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,757
They had promised there would be
temporary apartments here.

128
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,398
And in some mysterious way...

129
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,234
a year later
there's an office block.

130
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,235
Where we're sitting now?
- Where we are now.

131
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,705
But you feel you are taking action
on behalf of other people, too?

132
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,243
For ordinary people.
- We are ordinary people.

133
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,646
Well, you could be described
as a group of students.

134
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,584
I think it's ridiculous
that they try to label us.

135
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,521
It's not right. There are all sorts
of people here. All young, though.

136
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,227
But most of them are
working young people, I think.

137
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,932
This is a very mixed bunch.

138
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,969
But I think it will happen, or it
already does, that squats arise...

139
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,843
for people
in a different position...

140
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,778
for whom it's a difficult step.

141
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,779
You see that in the women
who are now in refuge homes.

142
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,185
They don't feel capable
of organising a squat themselves...

143
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,391
so they join an existing group
and squat along.

144
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,362
You see that happening for
families, for foreign immigrants...

145
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,567
and that's a good thing.

146
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,303
You deliberately go for
a commune set-up.

147
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,905
What does that imply?

148
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,906
That you deliberately opt
for living

149
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,177
with a group of other people...

150
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,178
and do lots of things communally.

151
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,850
And why is that?
- Why we choose to live like that?

152
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,822
I think that, so far, we've been very
individualistic in our lives...

153
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:35,064
which was also encouraged
by society: having to have a career.

154
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,636
And then you discover
there are other ways of living...

155
00:15:42,841 --> 00:15:45,841
than in a family home
with a fence and a garden.

156
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:49,645
That it's also possible to live
together with lots of people.

157
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:54,216
Loneliness if often the reason why
people live together or get married.

158
00:15:57,256 --> 00:16:00,256
And then you notice
that when you split up...

159
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,693
you get thrown back on your own
resources...

160
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,064
but it's a big step to take.

161
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,065
One reason why I wanted
to live in a group was...

162
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,371
that I could share my fear
with others...

163
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,372
and wouldn't be emotionally
dependent on one person.

164
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:19,608
And so that one other person
isn't emotionally dependent on me.

165
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:23,446
But I do like having other people
around me to share things with.

166
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:29,218
I'd just like to get back to
the subject of violence.

167
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,489
The squatters' movement has decided
to hit back.

168
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,959
You're not going to be
beaten out of here.

169
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:40,096
It wasn't so much a decision
of the movement as a whole...

170
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,799
as the fact that you don't
just accept a beating.

171
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:48,037
The only way you can...

172
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,775
fulfil your justified wishes...

173
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:56,312
is to make sure
you don't get beaten up.

174
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,482
That's why people now say that
squatters are getting more militant.

175
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:07,423
As if squatters are all armed
with helmets and iron bars, etcetera.

176
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,131
But it's only our reaction
to the threat...

177
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,802
of being attacked by the police
or by a gang of hired thugs...

178
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,509
and thrown out into the street.

179
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,679
That's why we're barricaded.

180
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,680
The only way to feel safe here...

181
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,086
is by turning it
into a kind of fort

182
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,954
for yourself
and the outside world.

183
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,323
I think it's so awful...

184
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,324
when you try to do something
peacefully, you meet with violence.

185
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,431
It's such a disappointment.

186
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:49,432
I now think: We were such idealists
and so stupid.

187
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,539
Are you bitter about it?
- I am, really.

188
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,109
I'm afraid of what's going to happen
in future.

189
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:05,147
If you keep seeing uniforms
everywhere...

190
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,752
you feel you could be arrested
any moment.

191
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,825
We're heading for a police state.

192
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,826
I can imagine that
if there's a threat of war...

193
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:22,031
it must be the same feeling.

194
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,601
The constant threat,
and the continual fear.

195
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,041
You feel threatened?
- Terribly.

196
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:32,076
You, too?

197
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,979
Certainly, yes.
- Yes.

198
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,980
How does that express itself?

199
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,751
It's a permanent feeling. It takes
over your whole day, your whole week.

200
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,791
The constant possibility
of hired thugs arriving.

201
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:54,063
And the interpretation in the press
that we provoked them.

202
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,469
It's a round-the-clock thing.
I even lie worrying at night, too.

203
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,841
Do you sleep well?
- Usually I do. I'm so tired.

204
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,180
Tired enough to sleep well.

205
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,994
5 May.

206
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,995
The celebratlons
ofthe '45 Ilberatlon.

207
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,576
Amsterdã.

208
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:41,445
A street, a square further down...

209
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,748
A hundred Moroccans.

210
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,749
Flrst they were welcomed
as our cleaners, our Illegal workers.

211
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,554
Now they are undeslrables who
have lived In a church for months.

212
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,028
Today they are packlng.

213
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,029
They wlll be spread
across the country.

214
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,732
Some wlll be arrested
and sent back home.

215
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,762
The boss never paid
social contributions for us.

216
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:50,232
We never got officially laid off,
so we get no benefits.

217
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,370
The Dutch government says:

218
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,973
You must have worked here
for two or three years.

219
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,912
I've worked here for three years.

220
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:04,913
There are men who've worked here
for seven years, or eight.

221
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,951
You have to have worked with
the same employer for 22 months.

222
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:13,055
But who stays that long
with one and the same employer?

223
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:17,292
You don't even get to stay that long
with your wife.

224
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,801
You marry and then
you have to go abroad.

225
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,802
And you see your wife
one month a year.

226
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,207
Why stay with one employer
for 22 months?

227
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,343
You were angry
when we wanted to film?

228
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,344
I was. I had slept badly.

229
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:40,282
The bed wasn't made
and I was very tired.

230
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,019
I told myself:
This is no way to live.

231
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:48,123
I was thinking of my children
and of my wasted life.

232
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,863
And right at that moment
a journalist wants to film me!

233
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,169
I won't have it. I didn't want to be
filmed in that state of mind.

234
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,274
I couldn't accept that I was
discovered in the state I was in.

235
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:15,050
That was all.

236
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:10,866
Sprlng has been declared In Parls.

237
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,429
The 'Goutte d'Or', the Golden Drop...

238
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,732
Is one or the oldest
Immlgrant areas In Europe.

239
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:47,002
Four or five generatlons ofAfrlcans
have lived here.

240
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:03,979
Dlctatlon, part 2.

241
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,984
Good day.

242
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:09,985
Do you have In front ofyou:
your exerclse book, yourpen...

243
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,291
and your asslgnment paper?

244
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:17,292
Yes? Then we're golng to do
the second dlctatlon.

245
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:24,232
We shall apply what we have learnt
In the flrst two lessons.

246
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:31,506
Down to work!
Here Is your dlctatlon.

247
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,984
Tltle:
the pollcemen and the bandlts.

248
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,202
The pollcemen...

249
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:01,203
were taklng...

250
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,846
a rest. Full stop.

251
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,917
But suddenly...

252
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:19,054
the telephone...

253
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,560
alerted them.

254
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,565
Colon.

255
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:31,368
People were attacklng...

256
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:34,369
a nelghbourlng agency.

257
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,874
Exclamatlon mark.

258
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,779
It Is Imposslble...

259
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:52,354
to count...

260
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,659
the attacks. Full stop.

261
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,710
I've been doing a dictation.

262
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:19,447
A dictation that I have to send in
for correction...

263
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,987
to the school.

264
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,890
I send it in an envelope.

265
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,891
Then it's corrected and the teacher
sends it back to me.

266
00:30:32,297 --> 00:30:34,832
Why are you doing a course
like this?

267
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,833
Because I want to learn
to type-write.

268
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:42,404
For myself,
or to get a job in a trading company...

269
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,878
or in the civil service.

270
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,814
I do this to learn to type.

271
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,815
Because you want
to make it your career?

272
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,456
It's not just that.

273
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:02,457
I have no qualifications
and I get bored not working.

274
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,533
You don't work?
- I don't.

275
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,534
Why not?
- Because I'm disabled.

276
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,038
How did that happen?

277
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,039
I had an accident.
A motorbike accident.

278
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:22,012
How did that happen?

279
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:25,013
At five in the morning
at my work.

280
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,220
We work in shifts.
There are three eight-hour shifts.

281
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:40,362
As one shift came off,
I drove into the factory...

282
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:44,132
and there was a collision.

283
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,535
I lost consciousness.

284
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,141
What kind of work was it?

285
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:54,142
I worked for Simca-Chrysler
in Poissy.

286
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,180
And since then?
- Since then I worked on and off...

287
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,585
but never for long.
A week or two.

288
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:08,957
I can't manage any longer.

289
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,202
How do your attacks come about?

290
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:22,203
I have this handicap...

291
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,274
and that brings on an attack.

292
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:31,179
Then I am like that for 2 or 3 days.

293
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,153
It's difficult, and dangerous.

294
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:39,154
That's why I take these medicines...

295
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:44,192
to stop the attacks.

296
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:47,696
I always have one of these
in my pocket.

297
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,768
I put it in my pocket, then I go out.

298
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,639
Just drinking a beer...

299
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,143
brings on an attack.

300
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:07,215
Immediately. But when I take this...

301
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:12,387
it stops. That's why... Wait.

302
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,932
I don't have many left.

303
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,338
This is for the cough.

304
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,339
I take tranquillizers.

305
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,363
I have this for the metro...

306
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,366
my green card.

307
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,703
My green card for free travel.

308
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,574
And I have my invalid card,
to show to the police.

309
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,980
When the police stop me,
I show them my invalid card...

310
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:16,117
and they let me through.

311
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:37,806
I have written letters
mostly to the health services...

312
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:41,042
twice to the Ministry of Health.

313
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,180
Your case is being dealt with,
they said.

314
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:50,118
Do you think it's right that
you get less than a Frenchman?

315
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,191
No, it doesn't make sense.

316
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:57,192
If a Frenchman gets
a disability pension...

317
00:34:59,864 --> 00:35:02,864
he also gets money from
the solidarity fund.

318
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
He gets money
from the disability fund...

319
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,872
and he gets
the compensatory benefit.

320
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:15,076
Then he has to go to a school...

321
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:19,914
to learn to type or
play the guitar or whatever...

322
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,220
to have a trade.
And he's well paid.

323
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:02,123
Is that your typewriter?
- No, it belongs to the school.

324
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,333
I have lessons from them.

325
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:18,606
Blind, like this.

326
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,679
I have to type here.

327
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,680
The third, first and second rows.
And the fingers always here.

328
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,852
This is how I recognise it.

329
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,491
Q, S, D, F...

330
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,492
J, K, L, M.

331
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:57,812
That's touch typing, isn't it?

332
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,228
Who is that?
- That's my daughter.

333
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,799
I look at her every morning
and evening...

334
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:23,137
because she is a long way away.

335
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:17,118
Were all your children born here?
- Yes, in this house.

336
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,726
How long have you been in France?
- Here? Forty-five years.

337
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,500
I've been here forty-seven years.

338
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:38,506
And have you worked all that time
in the building industry?

339
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:42,011
Yes.

340
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:45,012
As a labourer.

341
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:49,050
When did you stop working?

342
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:54,589
I haven't worked for
the last three years.

343
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:59,193
Do you get unemployment benefit?
- Unemployed? I am ill.

344
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:07,368
You get 1500 francs a month.
Who from?

345
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:11,305
From the social security.

346
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:17,612
So you have to live economically.
- We live according to our means.

347
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,220
Do I have to earn my living
as a male whore?

348
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:32,627
We live from what God gives us.

349
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:37,198
We put a good face on things.

350
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:43,673
How many children do you have?

351
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:46,674
I have had six children.
Three boys and three girls.

352
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:51,245
I lost two girls and a boy.

353
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:56,517
Did they die here in France?

354
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:01,322
I lost one girl when she was eight.
The boy died here in France.

355
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,360
He died at birth.

356
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,864
My oldest son is 36 and married.

357
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:16,237
And you stay at home?
- Always.

358
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:20,408
Don't you go shopping?
- Yes, I do the shopping.

359
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:25,248
Then I come home.

360
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:28,249
Have you worked in France?

361
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:32,386
I worked for the railways
for three years.

362
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,891
Then I became ill.
My daughter had died.

363
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:41,295
I got heart trouble
and had to stop working.

364
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,666
What did you do for the railways?
- Cleaning.

365
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:50,273
There is something wrong
with your hands.

366
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:53,274
From working.
It cost me my hands.

367
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:57,211
But I didn't report it.
I didn't know how to.

368
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:03,084
Did you only work in building?
- Yes, only in building.

369
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:05,955
Show us your hands.

370
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:08,956
Look. I have had several operations.

371
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:14,662
I spent four months in hospital.

372
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:19,233
The internist wanted me
to get unemployment benefit...

373
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,938
but the insurance doctor
wanted me to have...

374
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,041
another operation.
I didn't know what to do.

375
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:31,646
Now I have lost everything.

376
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:44,928
The early traln.

377
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:47,929
Ali travels to workjust once more.

378
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:09,012
On the footbrldge
to the car factory...

379
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:12,013
we are stopped
by the works pollce.

380
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:15,349
Ali Is afrald.

381
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:51,988
I am a man, It seems...

382
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:54,791
journeylng In my head
when I'm standlng stlll...

383
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:57,792
and marklng tlme when I'm movlng.

384
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:26,656
Thejourney goes on, but flrst...

385
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:29,657
In June, In Amsterdã...

386
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,960
we wltness the vlolent evlctlon
ofsquatters.

387
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,399
The Klnker Street squatters
negotlate wlth the clty councll...

388
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:42,770
In order to turn empty space
Into space for livlng.

389
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:46,841
A new woman hasjolned the group.

390
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:51,612
There was no chance
of a house for me.

391
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:54,982
I thought that in a refuge home
they would help me.

392
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,987
Why a women's refuge home?

393
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:00,988
To have somewhere to stay.
- Why there of all places?

394
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,792
I didn't know anywhere else.

395
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:08,829
But then...
- You couldn't stay at home?

396
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:13,234
No. I couldn't stay
where I was living.

397
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,471
I couldn't go back to my husband.
- Why not?

398
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:23,677
We were always at odds.

399
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:27,748
Too violently at odds.

400
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:37,525
Then one of the people here asked
the others if it was all right...

401
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:42,799
for me to stay here.

402
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,701
What is it like
to live with squatters?

403
00:46:45,702 --> 00:46:48,471
I've learnt more than I can say.

404
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,374
I never knew what was behind it all.

405
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,375
I always only heard
the negative stories...

406
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:57,578
and now I've experienced
lots of positive things.

407
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:01,916
Such as?

408
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:07,087
There's been a housing shortage
since the war.

409
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,926
We've always been brought up
to be well-behaved and polite.

410
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:16,797
We lived with our parents.
Our children did the same.

411
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:20,401
Now they live way out of town
because there's nothing in Amsterdã.

412
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:26,307
But these present-day youngsters...

413
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:29,743
they oppose all that.
They don't just accept it.

414
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,948
And I admire them and I wish
I was a lot younger.

415
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:41,622
In my marriage I was pushed
into a rut in the way we lived.

416
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:48,362
When I left I got into another rut
in the way I had to live.

417
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:54,635
Now I can do as I like
and say what I like.

418
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:59,039
You'd never have believed it just
by looking at it from the outside.

419
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:04,278
But because I live here
I know what it's like.

420
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:10,985
It's quite an experience!

421
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:14,955
DOWN WITH VIOLENCE

422
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:18,759
To prove that the squatters
don't want to use violence...

423
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:23,097
they have removed all throwable
objects from the roof.

424
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:27,935
We cannot leave the premises.

425
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:31,238
If the owner is dispossessed,
eviction is unnecessary.

426
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:35,676
Amsterdã, 19 August, 11. AM.

427
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,846
The evlctlon from the premlses
was not dlscussed by the Mayor.

428
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,984
And the squatters reacted wlth
the gesture ofclearlng the roof.

429
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:50,858
Anythlng that could be used
to throw down was removed.

430
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:57,331
We are expectlng a statement
from the Councll of Churches...

431
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:01,835
What's better
than a calorle-free klss?

432
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:11,178
Thls Is the two o'clock news.

433
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:15,182
Sr. Polak, Mayor ofAmsterdam,
Is not plannlng other evlctlons...

434
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:20,654
than the apartments
on Prlns Hendrlkkade.

435
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:23,657
Sympathlsers have broken up
the pavlng...

436
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:26,395
and made plles of the tlles.

437
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:29,396
Otherwlse the sltuatlon Is qulet.

438
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,462
Jurrlaan, can I have the mlke?

439
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,171
Look, motorcycle police.

440
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:16,777
Look at them.
- This is it. This is really it.

441
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:23,250
We have to say this, guys.
This mustn't happen.

442
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:27,187
Some people have jumped
into the water.

443
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:14,068
Are they commando units?
- Yes, in the van.

444
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:19,773
The man at the top of the crane...

445
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:30,617
Look, commandos with guns.
- Where?

446
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:33,787
Here, in the skip that's going up
right in front of you.

447
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,793
They've got machine guns.

448
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:40,794
They're getting on to the roof
with machine guns.

449
00:51:53,076 --> 00:51:56,076
They're carbines.

450
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:01,982
Still no statement, Moos?
- No.

451
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:05,719
They're going to use tear gas.
They've got masks.

452
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:09,389
Look at that skip.
Ready for action, with guns.

453
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,968
They're going to summon us soon.

454
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,969
When they do, I'll open the window.

455
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,642
Yes, now.

456
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,643
It wlll be answered wlth vlolence...

457
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:38,785
Riot squad, can you hear me?

458
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:43,323
Riot squad, can you hear me?

459
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,560
We reply in the shape
of a statement to the press.

460
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:52,399
A gigantic unit of the riot squad
has congregated...

461
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,770
so large it is incredible to see.

462
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:59,608
We're not going to be provoked...

463
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:02,609
by this display of power.
We have decided...

464
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:06,313
not to seek a confrontation
with the police force.

465
00:53:09,553 --> 00:53:12,087
We will keep the struggle
in our own hands.

466
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:15,088
The squats in luxury apartments
have led to a public discussion...

467
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,660
about these empty apartments that
are built all over the inner city.

468
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:26,333
Again: at least 1100 luxury
apartments are left uninhabited.

469
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:31,407
Now you want to clear them...

470
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:34,408
but the squatters have left
long ago.

471
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:39,112
The squatters have left the premises
a few hours ago.

472
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:46,386
But those who are looking for housing
can forget about this location...

473
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:52,893
for new squatters will arrive.
We will carry on!

474
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:42,542
CARRY ON

475
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:52,621
The road to the south contlnues.

476
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,622
Amsterdã. Parls. Lyons.
And Into the mountalns.

477
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:11,571
The Pollsh strlkers are
In a dlfflcult sltuatlon.

478
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:16,376
The government has accused them
of undermlnlng soclallsm.

479
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,828
What are you doing?
- I am distilling lavender.

480
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:41,401
How is the lavender trade?

481
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:45,272
Not so good.

482
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,343
Why is that?
- Because of the price.

483
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:52,612
It's hard to sell.

484
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:01,521
I heard that production costs
had risen.

485
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:04,526
Yes...

486
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,527
nowadays it costs more.

487
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:11,264
And the retail price?
- The retail price...

488
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:16,737
that can't rise.

489
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,710
Is that true of all crops?

490
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:28,482
Nearly all of them.

491
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:33,787
What are you going to do?

492
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:37,491
We're not young any more, are we?

493
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,765
Will you stay here?

494
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:45,766
Yes, we'll stay here
until we retire. And then...

495
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,239
that's it.

496
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,941
And the rest of the people here?

497
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:55,942
The same applies for just about
everyone here.

498
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,823
I have always lived here.

499
00:57:07,824 --> 00:57:10,592
On this farm?
- Yes.

500
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:13,593
Did you spend your youth here?
- I was born here, yes.

501
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:23,069
What did it use to be like here?

502
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,740
People were used to making do
with less.

503
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,510
They made do with less?

504
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,781
Costs were lower,
so we needed less money.

505
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:39,986
But did people have a good life?

506
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:43,990
You can't compare it.

507
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:47,262
Life was very different.

508
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:50,263
But was life better then
than it is now?

509
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:54,668
Or is life better now?

510
00:57:54,704 --> 00:57:57,704
I suppose it is better now.

511
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,977
Did life use to be too hard?
- Yes, it was indeed.

512
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:09,015
It is better now,
but people have to leave their land.

513
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:13,753
Yes, because...

514
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:17,557
we cannot keep up to date
technically.

515
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:28,268
We don't have any machines
to work on the slopes.

516
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:33,907
Don't they exist?
- Maybe they will one day!

517
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:38,745
But there are tractors which can
work slopes, aren't there?

518
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:43,683
Yes, but they are too expensive
for this sort of small farm.

519
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:02,068
The essence is lighter...

520
00:59:02,272 --> 00:59:05,272
it floats on the surface.

521
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:10,644
Is it a good product?
- Well...

522
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:15,450
it used to be a good product.

523
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:18,451
Is it a question of competition?
- Yes, it must be.

524
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:23,690
The demand may also have dropped.

525
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:29,462
What is it used for?

526
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:33,934
For perfumes.

527
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:38,305
And soap?
- Yes, also for soap and suchlike.

528
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:21,681
How did you meet your husband?

529
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:24,718
I just did by accident.

530
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:27,823
At a party?

531
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,659
No, by accident.

532
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,660
In a lane.

533
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:37,132
And then?
- Well...

534
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:39,701
we got to know each other
and then we got married.

535
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:41,269
And it was successful?

536
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:44,270
Yes, because I have been living here
for 27 years.

537
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:54,547
Are people leaving the area?

538
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:58,220
Yes, many are leaving.

539
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:01,221
And what do you think about that?

540
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:05,625
We take it as it comes.

541
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,996
But it must affect you?

542
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:14,134
Yes, it does a bit.

543
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:22,809
But could you tell me...

544
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:26,246
what the mountains mean to you?

545
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:29,816
What do you think as you climb them?

546
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:34,389
We have always lived here.

547
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,390
We think about the children,
about family and friends...

548
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:41,763
who have left for the city.

549
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:44,764
But we have always lived here.
We don't want to leave yet.

550
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:51,137
We have lived here.
And this is our life.

551
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:56,876
Do you ever think about
how the world changes?

552
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:01,948
Do you have any ideas about it?

553
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:05,652
Yes, we think about it sometimes.

554
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:11,191
What do you think, then?

555
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:14,194
We wonder what it will be like
for those after us.

556
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:20,667
Like unemployment, for instance?

557
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:23,805
Yes, exactly.

558
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:26,806
Because they talk about progress
and its advantages.

559
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:30,510
But there are disadvantages too.

560
01:02:34,817 --> 01:02:37,817
Such as?

561
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:41,521
I wouldn't know.

562
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,360
In the Alps, I thought:

563
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:01,361
'I'd Ilke sometlmes to be able
to look at slmply. '

564
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,386
Rome.

565
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:14,387
The Boca della Verlta.
The Mouth of Truth.

566
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:18,691
Putyour hand In and say: I love you.

567
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:22,795
Ifyou're Iylng, he'll blte It off.

568
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:35,835
I got to know my husband...

569
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:38,206
in...

570
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:40,642
nineteen...

571
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:42,877
twenty-one.

572
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:45,847
I met him...

573
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:48,848
when he was working
in a tuna fish factory.

574
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:53,819
He sealed the cans of tuna.
And cans of...

575
01:09:57,893 --> 01:10:00,028
olive oil.

576
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,397
That was in the fascist era, right?

577
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:05,398
That's when we came back.

578
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:09,802
We couldn't stay in Africa
any longer, because of the Party.

579
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,041
My husband hadn't seen his relatives
in ten years.

580
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:18,978
He wanted to see his village again.

581
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:23,683
So in 1923...

582
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:27,853
we came back to the area
of Reggio Emilia.

583
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,025
And then you became Italian?

584
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:34,026
No, I have always been Italian
since I was born.

585
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,900
I was acknowledged straight away
by my father.

586
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:45,838
It wasn't a fake acknowledgement...

587
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:49,711
for payment.

588
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:52,712
He personally went to register me
as his daughter...

589
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:58,317
with a woman
he wasn't allowed to marry.

590
01:10:59,154 --> 01:11:02,154
They weren't permitted to marry.

591
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:06,759
They just lived together,
my father and my mother.

592
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:10,963
They had five children.

593
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:15,568
Four boys and one girl: me.

594
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:18,638
All with the Italian nationality?
- All of them.

595
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:24,143
The boys all joined the army
to do their military service.

596
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:26,881
In 1923...

597
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:29,882
you couldn't go out
after nine o'clock in Italy.

598
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:33,886
The fascist party had set a curfew.

599
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,160
Voting was compulsory then.

600
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:46,100
Everywhere it said:

601
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:48,269
Vote!

602
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:51,270
People who didn't vote
for the fascists didn't get jobs.

603
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:58,112
I was coloured...

604
01:11:58,113 --> 01:12:01,113
so I always had a crowd
of children following me like flies.

605
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:06,752
They shouted: 'Look, a black woman,
a Negress. Look at that!'

606
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:12,958
What about his relatives?
- His parents were terrible.

607
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:17,563
They didn't want to share a meal
with me...

608
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:21,434
because I was black.

609
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,739
In despair I said to him:

610
01:12:24,740 --> 01:12:27,740
Either you allow me to go back
or I jump in front of a train.

611
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:32,113
The family suggested...

612
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:35,114
I leave one of my daughters
with my husband...

613
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:39,587
and that I take the other one
with me.

614
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:42,588
The older one I'd be allowed to keep.

615
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:46,125
She's not so black.
She's got black hair...

616
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:51,197
and an olive skin.

617
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:55,267
The other one had a white skin
and auburn hair.

618
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:00,539
She was white
and she'd be for her father.

619
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,710
So the whiter one would stay?
- Yes, with her father.

620
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:10,149
And the dark one
would come to Africa.

621
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:21,527
But I left for Africa
with my two girls.

622
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,800
I said: I won't have anything to do
with those people.

623
01:13:29,438 --> 01:13:31,773
Give me my daughters...

624
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:33,274
and I'll be off.

625
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:36,077
And my husband let me go.

626
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:38,079
After four months...

627
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,080
I could buy a ticket
for my husband.

628
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,420
He started work straight away.

629
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:50,823
Who was in power at that time?

630
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:54,660
Always the Italians.

631
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:58,164
It was Italy. And Eritrea was...

632
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:03,269
a dominion, a protectorate.

633
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:08,407
At first it was better.

634
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:13,479
There weren't so many differences.

635
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:17,216
But later on we couldn't sit together
or eat together.

636
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:23,758
We were always separate.

637
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:26,327
Was that segregation by colour?
- Yes, colour.

638
01:14:26,328 --> 01:14:29,328
Apartheid?
- Yes, apartheid.

639
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:47,813
NUCLEAR POWER MEANS
PROFIT FOR BOSSES...

640
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:51,016
AND CANCER
FOR THE PROLETARIAT

641
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:02,461
When the Second World War
had broken out...

642
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,500
we received a convocation
from the fascists...

643
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:10,870
that was addressed to
Comrade Spaggiari.

644
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:15,007
I said: 'My husband has never been
a comrade of yours.'

645
01:15:16,879 --> 01:15:19,879
'We'll see about that after the war',
they replied.

646
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:23,015
'We don't know yet
who's going to win or lose.'

647
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:27,953
God is great.

648
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:33,192
Do you remember
the end of the Italian era?

649
01:15:34,796 --> 01:15:37,796
The end of the Italian period?

650
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:41,901
They picked up all the Italians.

651
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:47,873
They put them all together on lorries
whether they wanted to or not...

652
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:51,746
and they shaved them bald.

653
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:53,915
And they abused them terribly.

654
01:15:53,916 --> 01:15:56,916
Many of them died
and many of them escaped.

655
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:04,590
And many of them got off
and ended up in Kenya.

656
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:12,197
In Nairobi. In concentration camps.

657
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:18,237
Were the English in power there then?

658
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:21,807
Yes, the English.
What did the English do?

659
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:25,377
The first thing they did was
to start plundering for food.

660
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:32,184
And there was prostitution
everywhere.

661
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:35,623
I even shook hands
with Haile Selassie.

662
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:38,624
And then you returned to Italy?

663
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:42,261
We had to leave in 1972.

664
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:46,667
Or we could stay...

665
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:49,668
at our own risk.

666
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:55,174
But we had to leave.

667
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,611
Because the Italians
were no longer in power.

668
01:16:59,581 --> 01:17:02,581
Eritrea had become...

669
01:17:03,018 --> 01:17:05,419
independent.

670
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,555
We had become undesirables.

671
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:10,556
We left everything behind.
Everything.

672
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:14,026
We only brought some spices...

673
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:18,263
because we couldn't live without.

674
01:17:19,768 --> 01:17:22,768
And some pea flour.
That's really good.

675
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:26,073
Only food.

676
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:28,576
And some jewellery. Gold.

677
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:31,577
Every year, my husband gave me
a gold bracelet...

678
01:17:31,947 --> 01:17:34,448
on our wedding anniversary.

679
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:37,449
I had 48 of them.

680
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:43,622
When he fell ill...

681
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:47,593
I had about 36 or 37.

682
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:51,296
They were very heavy.
They called me Lady Pompeii.

683
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:56,502
When you came back
did you have a housing problem?

684
01:17:57,005 --> 01:18:00,005
For the first 45 days
we were put in a boarding house.

685
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:04,076
In Rome?
- Yes, in Pensione Claudia.

686
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:08,047
We had enough to eat and drink.
They treated us well.

687
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:11,752
We had good food.

688
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:14,753
But on the 45th day...

689
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:18,490
they called us all together.

690
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:22,795
They gave us 500,000 lire
which we signed for...

691
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:26,665
and the next day
we were out on the street.

692
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:31,370
WE WON'T LEAVE THIS HOUSE
UNTIL WE'RE DEAD

693
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:59,326
Nonna Rosa from Erltrea...

694
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:00,928
elghtyyears old...

695
01:20:00,929 --> 01:20:03,929
lives wlth her great-nlece Alba,
and Ilttle Tonlno on the thlrd floor.

696
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:09,468
Born from the unlon ofthe colonlser
and the colonlsed...

697
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:14,108
she has never been at home
anywhere.

698
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:17,109
Erltrea, sltuated on the Red Sea...

699
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:20,512
was colonlsed by the Itallans
about a hundred years ago.

700
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:23,984
Every civlllsed country...

701
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:26,985
took Its share
from the Afrlcan cake.

702
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:29,890
Later, Ethlopla was selzed as well.

703
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:32,593
Flrst by the Itallan fasclsts...

704
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:34,862
and then by the Engllsh.

705
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:37,863
Then the colonlal perlod ended
and Emperor Halle Selassle returned.

706
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:44,102
In 1962 he annexed Erltrea
to Ethlopla...

707
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:48,776
to have a Ilnk wlth the sea.

708
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:51,777
Slnce then, Erltrea has been flghtlng
for Its freedom.

709
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:55,514
Ethlopla bombed wlth napalm bombs.

710
01:20:55,917 --> 01:20:58,419
Flrst wlth ald
from capltallst countrles...

711
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:01,420
but slnce Ethlopla has become
soclallst, wlth Russlan asslstance.

712
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:07,326
But for the sufferlng, we wouldn't
have known the name Erltrea.

713
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:49,868
TH E CHURCH BELONGS
TO TH E PEOPLE

714
01:22:23,805 --> 01:22:26,340
Let us pray.

715
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:29,341
O Father, we are here together
this morning...

716
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:35,549
to mourn for the death...

717
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:38,550
of our sister Catarina Callauti...

718
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:43,989
on its first anniversary.

719
01:22:45,727 --> 01:22:48,727
In our lives and in our society...

720
01:22:49,064 --> 01:22:51,732
and in our history...

721
01:22:51,733 --> 01:22:54,733
there are so many things...

722
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:58,603
that speak to us of death.

723
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:02,641
The evil that rules in the world,
oppression...

724
01:23:06,181 --> 01:23:09,181
injustice, illness...

725
01:23:10,385 --> 01:23:12,086
hunger...

726
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:13,921
and misery.

727
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:16,922
Think of our compatriots...

728
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:20,692
who have risked their lives...

729
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:25,297
sailing illegally to America.

730
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:33,340
And why?

731
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:36,341
Thinking about their families,
hunger and misery...

732
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:39,780
and their bosses in Calabria.

733
01:23:39,781 --> 01:23:42,781
Perhaps they had just finished
building a house...

734
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:47,452
when an earthquake destroyed
everything...

735
01:23:49,824 --> 01:23:52,226
and they lost all their capital.

736
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:55,227
According to St Luke
the same happened to the disciples.

737
01:23:57,265 --> 01:24:00,265
They had put all their hopes...

738
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:04,936
and all their trust in Jesus.

739
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:09,641
And it was all gone.
They didn't want to hear of it again.

740
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:15,781
The world was bad, wicked
and nothing could be done about it.

741
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:55,647
Tell me Natale, how did the ideia
for this atelier arise?

742
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:02,020
We wanted to do something
for the people...

743
01:26:04,859 --> 01:26:07,859
for the poor people in Calabria.

744
01:26:08,463 --> 01:26:11,463
We wanted to combat emigration
and unemployment.

745
01:26:14,102 --> 01:26:17,102
So we thought of setting up
a cooperative.

746
01:26:19,707 --> 01:26:22,707
The principle of a cooperative...

747
01:26:22,877 --> 01:26:25,877
is at the same time
a communal cultural evolution.

748
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:32,284
We are all equal and we take
our decisions communally.

749
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:36,288
That means emancipation for
the women. Because for women...

750
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:41,526
it's even more difficult
to find work.

751
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:50,936
Natale, could you throw
a bit more light on this lady?

752
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:58,410
Madam, is it true what he's saying?

753
01:26:59,314 --> 01:27:02,314
Yes, I believe in
what Natale was saying.

754
01:27:03,251 --> 01:27:06,251
Because we in Calabria,
and especially in Gioiosa...

755
01:27:09,057 --> 01:27:12,057
have always waited for jobs.

756
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:15,093
You can work on the land,
but that doesn't pay anything.

757
01:27:16,664 --> 01:27:19,664
I've been looking around for years...

758
01:27:20,768 --> 01:27:22,502
because I did want to work.

759
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:25,503
Then I heard that Natale
had founded this cooperative...

760
01:27:28,176 --> 01:27:31,176
and I put my name down.

761
01:27:31,980 --> 01:27:34,448
And now I work here.

762
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:37,084
I hope all turns out well.

763
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:40,085
Did you want to work
or was it necessary?

764
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:44,591
I had to work...

765
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:47,592
because my husband has had
an operation and he can't work.

766
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:52,099
And I have two daughters.

767
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,100
A family always costs money.

768
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:58,370
Was it easy as far as
family relationships were concerned?

769
01:28:00,675 --> 01:28:02,776
Has it changed a lot?

770
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:05,777
No, it hasn't changed much.

771
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:09,681
I get up, I do the housework,
I come here...

772
01:28:10,618 --> 01:28:13,618
and when I get home
I take care of the family.

773
01:28:14,322 --> 01:28:17,322
Some things get neglected.
I've got two jobs, really.

774
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:34,039
What do you think
of a priest like Natale?

775
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:37,409
I think that whatever he says,
he is always right.

776
01:28:41,282 --> 01:28:44,051
The other priests...

777
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:47,052
don't always say what is right,
I think.

778
01:28:50,525 --> 01:28:53,493
They don't speak the truth?

779
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:56,494
They think of themselves
and how to get rich...

780
01:28:57,498 --> 01:28:59,933
they and their relatives.

781
01:28:59,934 --> 01:29:02,934
But Natale thinks of us.

782
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:06,671
He organised this cooperative.
The others didn't do anything.

783
01:29:09,644 --> 01:29:12,279
Not in other villages either.

784
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:15,280
Natale was really sent by God...

785
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:18,318
that he created all this for us.

786
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:21,319
Who would have cared for us
poor people...

787
01:29:24,325 --> 01:29:27,325
if he hadn't?

788
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:47,479
Glolosa lonlca, a vlllage on the sole
ofthe boot ofltaly.

789
01:29:50,651 --> 01:29:53,651
Halfan hour further down the coast
Is Locrl.

790
01:29:53,855 --> 01:29:56,855
The prlest there Is called Don Stllo.

791
01:29:56,958 --> 01:29:59,958
A powerful man. They say he has a gun
under hls robes.

792
01:30:01,796 --> 01:30:04,796
Natale, you are working
in a structure...

793
01:30:07,635 --> 01:30:10,635
that is corrupt, isn't it?

794
01:30:10,938 --> 01:30:13,938
I have become conscious of it, yes.

795
01:30:18,012 --> 01:30:21,012
Since 1968 I have been working
in Calabria, here in Locri.

796
01:30:28,022 --> 01:30:31,022
First I was a rector in a seminary.

797
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:36,161
Then I started taking an interest...

798
01:30:36,297 --> 01:30:39,297
in a village in the mountains...

799
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:42,700
at about 1000 metres
above sea level.

800
01:30:43,871 --> 01:30:46,871
I became interested
in the people there.

801
01:30:47,308 --> 01:30:50,308
I was struck by the fact
that they saw in me, a priest...

802
01:30:52,213 --> 01:30:55,213
a powerful man
who could do them favours.

803
01:30:56,584 --> 01:30:59,584
For instance, they would ask me
for help in finding work for them.

804
01:31:03,724 --> 01:31:06,724
Right away I refused...

805
01:31:06,894 --> 01:31:09,429
to play that role.

806
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:12,430
I am not a powerful man...

807
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:16,069
and I don't want to be one.

808
01:31:16,070 --> 01:31:19,070
Then somebody asked:
Do you know Don Stilo?

809
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:23,208
He has a lot of influence.

810
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:27,145
They said he was involved in the mafia.

811
01:31:27,915 --> 01:31:30,915
One day, at a meeting of priests
people complained...

812
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:35,920
that young men
didn't want to become priests.

813
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:38,625
So I said:

814
01:31:38,626 --> 01:31:41,626
In our diocese there are priests
who are accused...

815
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:47,966
of being mafia bosses.

816
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:52,570
We do nothing against the situation.

817
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:56,040
How can we hope, with
that corrupt image of the Church...

818
01:31:57,278 --> 01:32:00,278
that young men want
to become priests?

819
01:32:00,381 --> 01:32:03,381
Then Don Stilo came to see me
after the meeting and he said:

820
01:32:06,153 --> 01:32:09,153
You are nothing but an ant.
I could crush you.

821
01:32:11,926 --> 01:32:14,926
And in the end...

822
01:32:15,396 --> 01:32:18,396
an old curate said to me:

823
01:32:19,033 --> 01:32:22,033
We know better than you.

824
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:26,004
You've been here
for too little time...

825
01:32:26,007 --> 01:32:29,007
to know how to conduct yourself.

826
01:32:29,644 --> 01:32:32,644
You'd better keep quiet
if you don't want to be killed.

827
01:32:41,789 --> 01:32:44,789
I think your brother's story
is very revealing.

828
01:32:47,094 --> 01:32:50,094
Could you tell us some more
about your brother?

829
01:32:53,334 --> 01:32:55,702
About what he did for people?

830
01:32:55,703 --> 01:32:58,703
He worked for the common good.

831
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:03,241
He never took anyone's side.

832
01:33:03,711 --> 01:33:06,711
He was good-natured
and helped everybody.

833
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:11,251
Friends and family.

834
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:14,252
Perhaps I should add
that he was a miller.

835
01:33:15,856 --> 01:33:18,856
He took the flour round the villages.

836
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:22,160
He started out single-handedly.

837
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:25,263
Later we had our own mill.

838
01:33:26,133 --> 01:33:28,735
Then the mafia came...

839
01:33:28,736 --> 01:33:31,736
and tried to set fire to it
or they burgled us...

840
01:33:36,477 --> 01:33:39,477
so that we would leave the place.

841
01:33:40,881 --> 01:33:43,881
Then one of the mafia bosses
was killed here in Gioiosa...

842
01:33:47,388 --> 01:33:50,388
and everybody was told
to close down their businesses.

843
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:55,495
But your brother...

844
01:33:55,496 --> 01:33:58,496
remained true to his principles.

845
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:02,300
He felt it was unjust
that such people...

846
01:34:02,603 --> 01:34:05,603
should force other people
to close down shop.

847
01:34:05,906 --> 01:34:08,906
He did not close down the mill...

848
01:34:10,378 --> 01:34:13,378
and he said that mafia people
were doing this...

849
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:19,250
and tyrannising people.

850
01:34:19,453 --> 01:34:22,453
One day he was taking flour
to one of his customers.

851
01:34:26,927 --> 01:34:29,927
They attacked him
from behind a hedge.

852
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Your brother denounced
their evil practices...

853
01:34:38,973 --> 01:34:41,973
and he paid for his courage
with his life.

854
01:35:53,114 --> 01:35:55,949
All these people...

855
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:58,950
were killed
in the last five years...

856
01:36:00,221 --> 01:36:03,221
by the mafia.

857
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:39,159
I go from face to face.

858
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:42,160
In the treadmill of overproduction,
madness and profit for the few.

859
01:36:47,835 --> 01:36:50,835
I don't know. Maybe the dead
would rather have lived.

860
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:31,375
We cross the sea to a country...

861
01:37:31,545 --> 01:37:33,646
whlch can breathe,
eat and drlnk...

862
01:37:33,647 --> 01:37:36,647
thanks to a river: the Nlle.

863
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:39,851
Its banks,
two narrow strlps ofgreen.

864
01:37:40,087 --> 01:37:43,087
Its delta, where It branches off
before flowlng out Into the sea.

865
01:37:44,892 --> 01:37:46,693
The rest Is sand.

866
01:37:46,694 --> 01:37:49,694
The liveable area Is no blgger
than Holland.

867
01:37:50,631 --> 01:37:53,499
Forty mllllon people live on It.

868
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:56,500
Each year, one mllllon are added.

869
01:43:33,941 --> 01:43:36,941
FOREVER... MY LOVE

870
01:46:36,089 --> 01:46:39,089
The day before 'Aid al-Kablr',

871
01:46:39,426 --> 01:46:42,426

872
01:48:33,473 --> 01:48:36,473
Look at him working.

873
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:13,212

874
01:49:13,213 --> 01:49:16,213

In the Musllm fastlng month...

875

Is a civll servant
as well as a taxi drlver.

876
01:49:22,722 --> 01:49:25,722
Slnce the war wlth Israel

877
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:30,062

878
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:33,063
The doors to the West have been
opened and fast money can be made.

879
01:49:34,768 --> 01:49:37,768
The new trades generate a new class.

880
01:49:37,771 --> 01:49:40,771
Importlng and exportlng luxury goods.
Luxury constructlon.

881
01:49:42,576 --> 01:49:45,576
In Ramadan's famlly there wlll be
lots ofmlnced meat tonlght.

882
01:49:46,513 --> 01:49:49,513
They want to show they can afford It.

883
01:49:56,356 --> 01:49:59,356
Tell them to come back tomorrow...

884
01:49:59,993 --> 01:50:02,993
and eat with us.

885
01:50:04,064 --> 01:50:07,064
We should have invited them tonight.

886
01:50:12,472 --> 01:50:15,472
Who's going to kill for us now?

887
01:50:17,077 --> 01:50:20,077
Can't Ibn Gadanfar come?

888
01:50:20,981 --> 01:50:23,981
He's the one
who killed Saadi's sheep.

889
01:50:49,275 --> 01:50:52,275
Let me do it.

890
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:04,655
Poor animal!

891
01:51:19,406 --> 01:51:21,473
The bloody hands on the wall...

892
01:51:21,474 --> 01:51:24,474
guard agalnst the evll eye.

893
01:51:24,778 --> 01:51:27,778
The Ilttle boy Is one step closer
to belng a man.

894
01:51:29,182 --> 01:51:32,182
The flrst mornlng ofthe celebratlons
they stuffthemselves wlth meat.

895
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:36,121
Those who have It.

896
01:51:36,122 --> 01:51:39,024
Mostpeople get less and less.

897
01:51:39,025 --> 01:51:42,025
Less proteln
per head ofthe populatlon.

898
01:51:47,967 --> 01:51:49,835
It's also the day ofthe young.

899
01:51:49,836 --> 01:51:52,836
They swarm out
across the squares, the parks...

900
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:56,840
among the pyramlds.

901
01:52:07,454 --> 01:52:10,454
Early on the second mornlng
people head for the cemeterles...

902
01:52:11,591 --> 01:52:14,591
to spend the day wlth the dead.

903
01:53:40,113 --> 01:53:43,113
Better-offfamllles have Ilttle
houses on or near thelr graves.

904
01:53:45,084 --> 01:53:47,219
Durlng the rest ofthe year

905
01:53:47,220 --> 01:53:50,220
these are Inhablted by the homeless.

906
01:53:51,591 --> 01:53:54,591
'And He it is...'

907
01:53:55,995 --> 01:53:58,995
'...who made the sleep a rest...'

908
01:54:04,938 --> 01:54:07,938
'...and made the night...'

909
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:13,510
'...a covering for you...'

910
01:56:21,541 --> 01:56:24,541
Don't go away.

911
01:56:25,144 --> 01:56:28,144
I've got food for you.

912
01:56:29,949 --> 01:56:32,949
We give alms
for the repose of our deceased.

913
01:56:36,656 --> 01:56:39,656
We come here every year
during the Feast of Sacrifice.

914
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:44,060
On these days
one is meant to go to the graves.

915
01:56:48,668 --> 01:56:51,668
Everyone goes and you meet everybody.

916
01:56:52,005 --> 01:56:55,005
All the family and friends.

917
01:56:55,875 --> 01:56:58,875
We all meet again here.

918
01:57:03,783 --> 01:57:05,984
Ramadan, where are we?

919
01:57:05,985 --> 01:57:08,985
This is our family vault.

920
01:57:10,289 --> 01:57:13,289
We gather here
for religious celebrations.

921
01:57:14,427 --> 01:57:17,427
Our dead are buried here.

922
01:57:18,197 --> 01:57:21,197
My father rests here,
my grandfather...

923
01:57:23,636 --> 01:57:26,636
as well as others.

924
01:57:26,973 --> 01:57:29,973
You give food to the poor people?

925
01:57:30,176 --> 01:57:33,045
We kill animals for the poor...

926
01:57:33,046 --> 01:57:36,046
so they will pray for our dead.

927
01:57:40,019 --> 01:57:43,019
We hire people
to read from the Qur'an.

928
01:57:52,298 --> 01:57:55,233
There are many poor people here?

929
01:57:55,234 --> 01:57:58,234
They're not all poor.

930
01:57:58,938 --> 01:58:01,938
They want alms as souvenirs.

931
01:58:03,810 --> 01:58:06,810
It brings good luck.

932
01:58:11,884 --> 01:58:14,884
It's a gift from God.

933
01:59:15,715 --> 01:59:18,116
Ramadan's brother Gamal...

934
01:59:18,117 --> 01:59:21,086
Is a guard
at the newly bullt Sheraton.

935
01:59:21,087 --> 01:59:24,087
I left the army in 1977.

936
01:59:24,357 --> 01:59:27,357
I was a commando.

937
01:59:29,695 --> 01:59:32,695
They were the best years of my life.

938
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:37,600
It was tough to leave the service.

939
01:59:38,471 --> 01:59:41,471
I missed my comrades.

940
01:59:43,309 --> 01:59:46,309
After I'd left the army...

941
01:59:47,046 --> 01:59:50,046
I became a guard
at the Sheraton Hotel.

942
01:59:55,521 --> 01:59:58,521
I keep out any unwanted visitors...

943
02:00:01,127 --> 02:00:02,894
to stop them...

944
02:00:02,895 --> 02:00:05,895
from committing offences.

945
02:00:08,234 --> 02:00:11,234
I earn 50 dollars a month.

946
02:00:14,073 --> 02:00:17,073
I would need
at least 120 dollars a month...

947
02:00:18,911 --> 02:00:21,911
to be able to marry.

948
02:00:22,448 --> 02:00:25,448
I've got financial worries.

949
02:00:26,519 --> 02:00:29,087
What can you do with 50 dollars?

950
02:00:29,088 --> 02:00:32,088
Cigarettes cost me
18 dollars a month.

951
02:00:37,196 --> 02:00:40,196
Public transport is 10 dollars.

952
02:00:42,902 --> 02:00:45,902
I spend around 20 dollars on food.

953
02:00:49,709 --> 02:00:52,709
It's hard to get out of this life.

954
02:04:23,355 --> 02:04:26,355
He who worshlps any other than God...

955
02:04:26,459 --> 02:04:29,459
wlll go to hell.

956
02:04:30,162 --> 02:04:33,162
Ifman abuses hls free wlll...

957
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:40,905
he ceases to be free.

958
02:04:40,906 --> 02:04:43,906
He does not have the rlght...

959
02:04:44,877 --> 02:04:47,877
to use the freedom
God has given hlm...

960
02:04:48,080 --> 02:04:51,080
to declde
whether he wants to belleve or not.

961
02:04:51,917 --> 02:04:54,917
He must use hls freedom...

962
02:04:55,087 --> 02:04:58,087
to hold hls own In thls world.

963
02:04:58,157 --> 02:05:00,892
He cannot choose.

964
02:05:00,893 --> 02:05:03,893
He lives In thls world
accordlng to God's plan.

965
02:05:05,264 --> 02:05:08,264
He must sow and reap.

966
02:05:09,235 --> 02:05:12,235
In heaven, he won't have to any more.

967
02:05:12,438 --> 02:05:14,906
There, all wlll be In abundance.

968
02:05:14,907 --> 02:05:17,907
He who obeys God voluntarlly...

969
02:05:20,813 --> 02:05:23,813
wlll be rewarded In the heavens.

970
02:05:24,316 --> 02:05:27,316
Ifl renounce certaln deslres...

971
02:05:28,687 --> 02:05:31,687
I wlll forever be happy
In heaven.

972
02:05:35,261 --> 02:05:36,761
Sadat:

973
02:05:36,762 --> 02:05:39,762
Llbya, South Yemen
and the Palestlnlans...

974
02:05:42,201 --> 02:05:45,201
support the Sovlet Unlon
agalnstAfghanlstan.

975
02:05:49,608 --> 02:05:52,608
Thelr crlmes
not only concern the Arabs...

976
02:05:57,249 --> 02:06:00,249
but the entlre Musllm world.

977
02:06:01,487 --> 02:06:04,487
That's why we're calllng
for the creatlon...

978
02:06:07,359 --> 02:06:10,359
of an alllance
ofMusllm natlons...

979
02:06:10,396 --> 02:06:13,396
and Arab natlons.

980
02:06:24,843 --> 02:06:27,843
And let us not forget
the civll war In Lebanon...

981
02:06:29,448 --> 02:06:32,448
whlch has been golng on
for seven years.

982
02:06:32,885 --> 02:06:35,885
Lebanon Is divlded.

983
02:06:38,490 --> 02:06:41,490
The Syrlans are In Lebanon.

984
02:06:41,860 --> 02:06:44,860
SaudiArabla, Kuwalt and others...

985
02:06:45,331 --> 02:06:48,331

986
02:06:48,567 --> 02:06:51,135
of the Syrlan army.

987
02:06:51,136 --> 02:06:54,136
Israel has annexed
a plece ofLebanon...

988
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:57,640
and Is bulldlng roads there.

989
02:07:26,705 --> 02:07:29,073
A doctor frlend...

990
02:07:29,074 --> 02:07:32,074
arranges for us to vlslt Fawzl,
a nlght watchman.

991
02:07:32,678 --> 02:07:35,446
It's hard to get to speak
to a poor man,

992
02:07:35,447 --> 02:07:37,615
though there are mllllons of them.

993

996
02:07:50,696 --> 02:07:52,530
How is your life?

997
02:07:52,531 --> 02:07:54,866
Bad. Really bad.

02:08:02,675 --> 02:08:05,675
Why did you move to Cairo?
- I've been here five months now.

1000
02:08:07,413 --> 02:08:10,413
I was a farmer.

1001
02:08:10,783 --> 02:08:13,783
But that was a very hard life.

1002
02:08:14,286 --> 02:08:17,286
Did you go to school?
- No.

1003
02:08:19,692 --> 02:08:22,692
There was no one who looked after me.

1004
02:08:25,964 --> 02:08:28,964
How old are you?
- I'm 45.

1005
02:08:30,269 --> 02:08:33,269
And your wife?

1006
02:08:33,906 --> 02:08:36,174
She's 18.
- No, 15.

1007
02:08:36,175 --> 02:08:39,175
How much do you earn?
- 25 dollars a month.

1008
02:08:44,450 --> 02:08:47,450
How much do you spend?
How much do you save?

1009
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:51,320
The rent is 12 dollars.
I have to live off the rest.

1010
02:08:52,991 --> 02:08:55,991
How much do you spend on food?

1011
02:08:57,096 --> 02:08:59,864
More than 2 dollars a day.

1012
02:08:59,865 --> 02:09:02,865
I work all night.

1013
02:09:02,868 --> 02:09:05,868
Till 6 in the morning.

1014
02:09:07,639 --> 02:09:10,639
How many hours?

1015
02:09:10,843 --> 02:09:13,444
12 hours.

1016
02:09:13,445 --> 02:09:16,347
From the night to the morning.

1017
02:09:16,348 --> 02:09:19,348
How is life here in this area?

1018
02:09:21,086 --> 02:09:24,086
Bad. It's a bad place to live.

1019
02:09:25,224 --> 02:09:28,224
Tell them it's certo.
- It's certo.

1020
02:09:36,635 --> 02:09:39,635
We mustn't give these people
a bad impression.

1021
02:09:42,574 --> 02:09:45,574
Even if it's hard,
tell them it's certo.

1022
02:09:47,546 --> 02:09:50,081
Let's keep the truth
between ourselves.

1023
02:09:50,082 --> 02:09:53,050
The foreigners don't need to know.

1024
02:09:53,051 --> 02:09:56,051
Say it's certo.

1025
02:10:02,294 --> 02:10:04,762
What do these people want?

1026
02:10:04,763 --> 02:10:07,198
What do they want?

1027
02:10:07,199 --> 02:10:10,199
They're foreigners.

1028
02:10:13,005 --> 02:10:16,005
The doctor sent them here.

1029
02:10:16,809 --> 02:10:19,809
They want to make a film about us.

1030
02:10:20,345 --> 02:10:23,345
Is this doctor a foreigner?
- No.

1031
02:10:23,448 --> 02:10:26,448
But she knows these foreigners.

1032
02:10:32,724 --> 02:10:35,724
There's no danger, don't be scared.
They're just making a film.

1033
02:10:39,698 --> 02:10:41,866
No problems?
