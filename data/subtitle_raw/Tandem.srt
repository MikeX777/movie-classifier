1
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,280
Rivetot,
what in the world are you doing?

2
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,120
- I wasn't going to kill him.
- Kill who? What?

3
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,000
- The dog!
- Which dog?

4
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,840
A red dog.
It's the first one I've ever seen.

5
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,440
He crossed the street
just in front of us.

6
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,720
I almost got him,
did you get hurt?

7
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,120
So where is that dog?
We could adopt him.

8
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,040
No. But..

9
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,880
Hell, I wasn't dreaming!

10
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,120
A huge dog, scarlet red.

11
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,160
He looked as if he was blood-soaked.

12
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,760
- I don't know.
- I'm not crazy.

13
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,200
You must have
fallen asleep for a moment,

14
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,760
or you had a hallucination.

15
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,440
Boy! Right in front of the wheel.
What happened?

16
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,480
A giant dog,
with feverish,

17
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,320
very sparkling eyes.
- You, too?

18
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,320
There, Michel! I wasn't dreaming.

19
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Let's see!
This region is famous for it.

20
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,800
A big red dog keeps crossing
the streets around here,

21
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,600
to test the driver's reactions.

22
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,480
Hey! Look out!

23
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,280
Stop! Stop!

24
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,880
- I'm lost.
- The beast must have left,

25
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,040
or it's scared to get a beating.

26
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,360
- Don't joke about it.
- What do we do?

27
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,320
We wait for nightfall,

28
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,880
to see the dog dancing
the rumba in our headlights?

29
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,880
- Or we can leave right away?
- Hey! Ho!

30
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,160
Wait one minute!

31
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,520
I know you!
You're Michel Mortez.

32
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,760
Unbelievable. Come,
let's take a picture. Madeleine!

33
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,920
Attention.

34
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,800
Sir, don't move,
you'll be out of focus. Good.

35
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,800
Smile.

36
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,360
Thanks.

37
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,480
Rivetot! Light my way, please.
I can't see anything.

38
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,600
Ah! Thanks.

39
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,320
Hello? Hello, love, it's me.
Yes, it's me, darling.

40
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,360
Ah! Yes. Not at all!
Do what you have to.

41
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,320
April, in Rio, certainly.

42
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,520
How great! How lucky!

43
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,920
What?
No, don't change anything for me.

44
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,760
If you have a meeting, I don't
want you to be late because of me.

45
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,360
Please.

46
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,880
Of course!

47
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,960
I, kiss you?

48
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,720
Yes, I kiss you everywhere.

49
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,800
- How are you?
- It isn't easy, you know?

50
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,320
- At least she loves you.
- So she says.

51
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,880
We have a reservation
under Mortez et Rivetot.

52
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,600
Oh! Yes!
You're the gentlemen from the radio.

53
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,680
M. Mortez! Here, there are
two rooms reserved for you.

54
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,760
We expected you earlier.

55
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,800
We were held up by
a red dog with yellow eyes.

56
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,520
Oh, no!
Rabies?

57
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,880
Don't worry, dear lady,
the beast didn't dare.

58
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,600
Don't worry,
I'll live through it.

59
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Really? You scared me.
Strange things happen.

60
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,200
Say, do you have
one room with two beds?

61
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,760
- Yes, why?
- We'll take that one.

62
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,520
- We'd reserved two rooms.
- Yes,

63
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,920
but...

64
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,360
No. We changed our mind.
We'll only take one.

65
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,640
I have the two rooms,
and others, if you want.

66
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,760
It's very quiet.

67
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,400
My chauffeur has type B Diabetes.

68
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,240
He needs constant care.

69
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,200
If I'm not there with him,
he may be dead tomorrow morning.

70
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,240
This would have repercussions
on the reputation of your hotel.

71
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,920
That's why we need
a room with two beds.

72
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,040
I wasn't aware of this.
Forgive me.

73
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,200
- Should I take the bags?
- No, thank you, we'll be ok.

74
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,800
- I look like an idiot.
- At all!

75
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,680
Michel! What's wrong?

76
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,480
Michel! Are you ok?
Can you hear me?

77
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,480
- Michel!
- What's wrong with him?

78
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,240
Nothing, bring the stuff
to our room, Michel, are you ok?

79
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,560
I'm fine.

80
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,200
There, get up, hep!

81
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,520
There we have it.

82
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,200
I'm diabetic
and you faint on us!

83
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,920
Come on, walk straight,
there's the landlady.

84
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,240
You didn't see anything:
nothing happened.

85
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,280
Are you ok? Alright.

86
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,200
- So you like the room, sirs?
- Good, very good.

87
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,240
Very nice.

88
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,240
Please!

89
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,440
- Is there a restaurant?
- Excuse me?

90
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,720
Can we have dinner?

91
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,360
I'm afraid you can't at this hour.

92
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,160
I must insist, madame.

93
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,880
It was a long and hard trip,
now we'd like to eat a bite.

94
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,480
I'll check if my husband can
heat anything up for you.

95
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,720
We'll take a quick shower
and be back down.

96
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,720
Are you finished?
Can I bring the desert?

97
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,760
- Yes, thanks.
- It was delicious.

98
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,440
- There's only one slice of cake.
- Thank you, miss.

99
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,480
Is it home-made?

100
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,360
Yes, not in this home,
but it's very good.

101
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,760
Great, should we share?

102
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,160
- Take the fruit, I love the dough.
- Delphine!

103
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,200
Shit, I don't understand.
5 000 Francs are missing.

104
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,160
- You hear?
- You miscalculated.

105
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,200
It's all my fault.

106
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,160
- It always is.
- Easy, you!

107
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,080
Did you steal it?

108
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,440
- It isn't your money.
- No, it isn't,

109
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,880
but I'm responsible for it.

110
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,080
So, it's you?

111
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,760
Is everything satisfying?
Did you like the meal?

112
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,160
It was perfect.

113
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,160
If I'd asked you for 5 000 F,

114
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,680
- would you have lent them to me?
- Of course, not.

115
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,640
See?

116
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,760
I knew it was you.
I'm disgusted.

117
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,800
I calculated it.
33 000 are missing.

118
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,200
How can we account for that?

119
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,560
- Stop moaning, I'll give it back.
- Really?

120
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,520
When?

121
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,680
Whenever you want, buddy.

122
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,320
Tonight, if you want.
I'll give them to you, this evening.

123
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,320
Say,

124
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,920
is the casino of your borough
open this season?

125
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,040
Hem,..no.

126
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,080
- Closed.
- Shame.

127
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,320
- Good evening, Sirs.
- Goodnight.

128
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,040
5 000 F more or less,
I don't see the problem.

129
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,480
I'm fed up with
bailing you out.

130
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,880
I'm sorry for you, Rivetot.
You can be so petty!

131
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,600
"Petty"?
Look who's talking!

132
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,960
Because of your debts,
we have to stay in dubious hotels,

133
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,040
and share a room,
to save money!

134
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,080
- I've no more privacy!
- As if you needed any!

135
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,480
It may be true, Michel.
Take it easy.

136
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,240
I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

137
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,400
Good night.

138
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,480
It's been twenty years,
aren't' you tired of it?

139
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,040
Since the Cat's Tongue's beginning,

140
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,320
I added it up,
I asked 94 203 questions

141
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,240
and met 18 603 candidates.

142
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,800
I'm not like those
actors in theatres,

143
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,680
always saying the same lines,
on the same cues,

144
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,240
to the same partners
every evening, no.

145
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,040
For me it's different every time.

146
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,800
So, you see,
I'm not tired of it.

147
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,200
Michel! You'll be late for the
selection of the candidates.

148
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,360
- I'm not done with my interview.
- They're waiting.

149
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,760
Go, M. Mortez, don't worry.

150
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,400
- You've only asked two questions.
- That's ok.

151
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,280
When were you here last time?

152
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,800
I don't know.
Two years ago, in march. Why?

153
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,200
I'll look in the archives,
and copy the article.

154
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,040
- Goodbye, Sirs.
- Goodbye.

155
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,120
That little asshole!

156
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,480
Who hits it?

157
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,320
Hold on a minute!
Do you know how much that's worth?

158
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,560
Come closer.
We can't hear you.

159
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,760
Let's repeat the applause.
When I raise my arm, you applaud.

160
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,280
When I lower it,
you're quiet. OK?

161
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,040
Let's try it. Attention!

162
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,840
Well?
Is that what you call an applause?

163
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,960
You ought to be ten times louder.

164
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,480
Go on!

165
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,520
There! Formidable!
You're formidable!

166
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,200
You're on in 1 minute 30 seconds.

167
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,920
- OK. Is it sunny in Paris?
- Not really, and you?

168
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,080
Rather shitty.

169
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,520
You gotta hang in there.

170
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,560
In two months,
you're in the studio.

171
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,760
What?

172
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,040
Haven't you heard?
Mortez'show is off.

173
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,920
You're joking?

174
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,360
- We've known it for a week.
- I don't believe it.

175
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,840
There must be a mistake
Did they just change the slot?

176
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,240
Philippe, listen!
Check if they changed the slot.

177
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,280
And guess what replaced it?
Hello?

178
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,640
Airing in 30 seconds.
Go! On you.

179
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,760
Thank you, Jerome,
for this clubbing hit.

180
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,080
It's time for
our daily hour with Michel Mortez

181
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
who's in Marez

182
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,000
for his game,
the Cat's Tongue.

183
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,680
Maréziens, how are you?

184
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,800
Today we are in

185
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,840
Marez,
in the Friac county,

186
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,440
where we'll be next week, as well.

187
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,280
And?

188
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,040
Marez prises itself
home of a XII century castle,

189
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,800
unfortunately damaged
in the bombings of 1944.

190
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,640
Marez,
city of flowers and smiles,

191
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,640
whose packaging
and household items industry

192
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,840
are famous throughout France.

193
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,880
Don't ever do this again!

194
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,560
M. Vaillant, you're too young
to have seen the 1944 ruins.

195
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,960
Since when do you live in Marez?

196
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,120
I came here six years ago.

197
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,080
You're a science teacher
at the Marez High school?

198
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,320
Indeed.
Physics and Chemistry.

199
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,760
Physics and chemistry
aren't very popular.

200
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,600
I envie the drawing teachers.

201
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,880
"It's an australian state,
a port in Canada,

202
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,560
"a lake in equatorial Africa..."
- It's his voice.

203
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,640
Hello, I'm the repairman...

204
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,800
What timing!

205
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,360
Attention! Only five seconds!

206
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,680
Ah, I... I know it.

207
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
I know it.

208
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,960
The answer?

209
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,040
Are you giving your Cat's Tongue?

210
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,840
Well, yes.

211
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,840
I'm sorry, many listeners
must have known the answer.

212
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,240
It was the Victoria falls.

213
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,160
I knew it.

214
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,480
- I was afraid I'd be wrong.
- Sorry.

215
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,600
This was an easy question.

216
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,040
"Born in 1778,
died in Paris in 1850,

217
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,360
"he worked on gas expansion.

218
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,440
"and announced some basic laws,

219
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,360
"like, for instance,
thermic coefficiency.

220
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,480
"The name of this french physicist
is worth ten points.

221
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,160
"his christian name Louis-Joseph."

222
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,720
Everybody knows
Louis-Joseph Gay-Lussac!

223
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,880
Sir, it wasn't your turn
to answer!

224
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,200
I'm sorry, madame,
but what difference does it make,

225
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,720
you already
were comfortably ahead.

226
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,720
- You're putting it all at stake?
- No, I prefer to stop here.

227
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,080
As you wish,
the jackpot increases of 1 000 F

228
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,840
and tomorrow will be at 27 000 F.

229
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,480
See you tomorrow,
at the Cat's Tongue.

230
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,080
Maréziennes et Maréziens,
be well!

231
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,880
Philippe?
Were you bullshitting me?

232
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,400
Which language should we speak?

233
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,920
The show is cancelled.
Mortez is out.

234
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,720
Why weren't we informed?

235
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,360
We should be, soon.
It went out with today's mail.

236
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,440
Good luck for telling
the old man . See you!

237
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,320
You're horrible.

238
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,800
- Michel, can I speak to you?
- Just one moment.

239
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
It's important.

240
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,960
Michel!

241
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,840
Michel! Get up, Michel!

242
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,040
It's nothing. Michel!

243
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,520
I don't see the point
of exhausting you like this,

244
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,600
if we have to
keep you going like this.

245
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,840
You're giving me lessons?
You want any? You sound like papa.

246
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,640
You know, Michel, maybe you have
to stop before it's too late.

247
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,360
One has to stop
when one's at the peak.

248
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,800
Over my dead body.

249
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,360
With a syringe up my arse
I'd get up on stage.

250
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,520
And that's
where you can put your lessons.

251
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,120
- Can I have an autograph?
- Certainly.

252
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,560
- What's your name?
- Michel, like you.

253
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,800
"For Michel", signed "Michel".

254
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,440
- Thank you, M. Mortez.
- Oh, please.

255
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,240
What did you want to tell me,
earlier?

256
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,240
Huh?
Nothing important.

257
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,480
- Are you leaving today?
- Yes, why?

258
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,440
- Do you have a better idea?
- No, I was just asking.

259
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,960
It's always the same.

260
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,400
A different city every day.
We don't have time to get attached.

261
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,160
- Do you love your job?
- Not bad, we see lots of places.

262
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,560
- We did Switzerland and Belgium.
- Really?

263
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,200
Hotels, restaurants,
the road, all the time,

264
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,320
male friends, tout ça...

265
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,120
I owe the great success
of this show to you,

266
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,840
and the audience, which ...
since 15 years, no, 20, 25 years,

267
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,120
follows, listens and encourages me.

268
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,960
I drink to your fidelity,
ladies and gentlemen. Cheers!

269
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,760
Delicious!

270
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,840
This isn't just a decor,
Let's eat.

271
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,720
- Go. Hello, girls!
- Are you coming back?

272
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,440
Oh, if we ever get back here,

273
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,800
you'll be married with children,
a family and all that,

274
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,440
- You're lucky.
- Do you have children?

275
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,800
No, I'd love to,
but Mortez doesn't want any.

276
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,800
It wouldn't be good for the kid:
a different school every day..

277
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,760
There, little Mareziennes, behave!

278
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,400
And when the direction announced

279
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,720
that they wanted
the show for another 10 years,

280
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,720
I couldn't believe it.
And yet, it was true.

281
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,760
It's marvel...

282
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,720
Oh! There it's for me.
My driver awaits me.

283
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,760
I'm chatting away,
but we have a long road ahead.

284
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,280
Thanks for everything,
thank you all.

285
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,240
Maréziennes, Maréziens,
be well.

286
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,520
Say, M. Mortez,
I'm sorry for earlier.

287
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,200
It's ok.
You'll do better next time.

288
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,640
Especially because I knew
the answer, the Victoria falls.

289
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,480
Everybody knew it.
You had a blank. Goodbye

290
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,120
Yes, speaking of blanks,
we're going to Mézoches-le-Château.

291
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,040
Indeed.

292
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,880
Look.

293
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,240
- That's the fourth one.
- The fourth what?

294
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,760
That man on the bridge.

295
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,960
I wonder what they're doing there.
you've got to be bored to death.

296
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,440
He doesn't bother anyone.

297
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,280
He bothers me. One day,
one of them will go crazy.

298
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,320
he'll throw his bike on a car.

299
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,800
You'll see, Michel.

300
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,600
I'm not a fan of it,
besides it makes you thirsty.

301
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,160
You could have gotten
a thermos with champagne.

302
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,360
Enough,
I'm becoming nauseous.

303
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,480
You, you threw up?

304
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,080
I don't understand!

305
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,480
When you don't digest well,
you shouldn't be eating.

306
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,160
It's a waste.

307
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,000
In my parent's house,
the gas counter was in the garage.

308
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,640
When I was little,
I spent hours in front of the dial,

309
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,520
watching the numbers turn.

310
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,560
The ones on the right turn faster.

311
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,480
At ten,
the two last numbers both change.

312
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,920
To see three change,
you had to wait a lot.

313
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,680
Four numbers, very rare.
It almost never happened.

314
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,320
I came at lunch time,
when the numbers turned quickly.

315
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,040
I said to myself:

316
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,240
"I'll wait for three numbers
to change, and I'll leave."

317
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,400
I spent so much time
in front of that counter!

318
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,800
Now that everything's electric,

319
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,320
your childhood
would have been less tedious.

320
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,720
One can
watch an electric counter, too.

321
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,840
It moves, too.

322
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,080
But it's silent,
it doesn't go clac-clac,

323
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,160
so, it's less interesting.

324
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,560
Yes, you must have done
strange things when you were little.

325
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720
I spent my time at the casino,
watching the roulette turn.

326
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,080
watching the roulette turn.

327
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,920
Yes, it's true.

328
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,400
My parents were diplomats,
but baby-sitters were expensive,

329
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,520
so they brought me to
the casino in the evening.

330
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,720
And as I was
very good with martingale,

331
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,760
I won the bank every night.

332
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,520
So they banned me,
but I didn't care,

333
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,960
because by that time,

334
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,320
I was able to pay for
a babysitter myself.

335
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,480
- You don't believe me.
- Oh, yes, I do.

336
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,000
It's a known fact. In Las Vegas,
there's a casino named after you.

337
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,080
See, you don't believe me.

338
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,280
Did you put it on cotton?

339
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,200
Yes.

340
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,000
- What is it?
- It's for Mr Mortez.

341
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,400
- There was a call from Paris.
- Pst!

342
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,480
- He's sleeping.
- Oh! I'm sorry.

343
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,960
There. Mr Mortez is to call
Mr Gaultier, at the radio.

344
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,400
He said it was urgent.
He'll be there until eight PM.

345
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,200
Very good, we will, thank you.

346
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,760
- Excuse me.
- No worries, he was sleeping...

347
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,120
What was it?

348
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,800
Oh, nothing, somebody
came to the wrong room.

349
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,240
- Pretty?
- No, not really.

350
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,520
Oh, well, what a pity.

351
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,680
Shame, shame. Shit!

352
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,920
- What's on TV tonight?
- We don't have TV.

353
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,600
- Well, congratulations to that!
- I'm going to sleep, I'm beat.

354
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,440
At this time?
Let's go to town?

355
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,440
Vésilly by night...

356
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,200
Mademoiselle,
we'd like to hang out a bit.

357
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,000
What do you suggest?

358
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,200
Well, it's nine PM,
everything is closed.

359
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,840
What's at the movies?

360
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,200
I don't know,
I'll ask Madame.

361
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,320
Madam Tarrère, do you know
what they're showing at the Caméo?

362
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,480
It's... D r Shivago,
b ut the movie has already started.

363
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,760
As I've mentioned,
we're not tired.

364
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,120
How about a game,
like Scrabble, for instance?

365
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,360
- Oh, not a Scrabble!
- A what?

366
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,760
Scrabble is a game
in which you form words out of

367
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,720
the available letters.

368
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,720
I don't understand. Our clientele
consists mainly of agents.

369
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,520
Tell me about it.

370
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,560
If you like, I'll go get
my son's Monopoly.

371
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,000
Oh, yes! That's great!

372
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,280
You'll see,
Monopoly is hilarious.

373
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,000
- Perfect, is the game interesting?
- No.

374
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,080
So, we'll be bored as hell.

375
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,680
There, I'll buy Rue de La Paix,
that'll hurt.

376
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,120
I'm sure the casino is open?
Shall we go?

377
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,440
No, why don't you go, Michel.

378
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,760
If you have seven,
you'll get to me, it'll cost you.

379
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,040
You'll owe me 60 000.

380
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,120
Oh, no! The houses. Ah! I failed.

381
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,560
I almost got you.

382
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,160
- I'm done. You win.
- No!

383
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,520
You can still come back.

384
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,400
You can keep playing alone,
I'm going to sleep.

385
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,040
Yes, playing Monopoly alone,
thanks very much.

386
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
You're not funny.

387
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,520
For once we were having fun.
There! Ha!

388
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,520
We'll play dice to establish

389
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,840
who takes the small
and who takes the big bed.

390
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,880
Take the big one, I don't care.

391
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,280
Who will clean up?
Yours truly.

392
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,880
Who'll put you to bed?

393
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,200
Hep, the dirty laundry.

394
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,520
So, when do
your fucking parents get back?

395
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,840
You don't know?
Nor do I.

396
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,800
You can't stay here,
we're already two in the room.

397
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,280
And the other isn't exactly a doll.

398
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,520
Is someone here?

399
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,840
Give me 500 Francs.

400
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,080
- What time is it?
- Stop your moaning.

401
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,000
Give me 500 Francs.

402
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,880
What?
Another sighting of a red dog.

403
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,840
No. Look.

404
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,000
- What?
- The counter shows

405
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,800
83 138 km.
- So?

406
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,160
83 138, a number you can
read from left to right, and

407
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,000
from right to left.

408
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,960
- Yes, so?
- That's all.

409
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,720
Isn't that great?

410
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,400
I bet 500 Francs that
you don't know the next number

411
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,880
that works in both directions.

412
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,440
- No.
- No?

413
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,240
83 238.

414
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,680
- You owe me 500 Francs.
- No, I didn't bet.

415
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,840
Are you crazy?

416
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,320
I'm sorry, it's because...
I believed a bicycle...

417
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,720
on the bridge.

418
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,240
Of course I believe you, my love.
How would I not believe you?

419
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,480
But...

420
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,600
But ...
Oh, let me speak!

421
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,840
Oh! That you... Yes!

422
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,800
Wed... wednesday.
But you must warn them.

423
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,200
No, don't tell me...

424
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,720
Ah! How I love you!

425
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,120
Of course. Of course, I'll tell him.

426
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,520
I promise, I'll tell him.

427
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,320
If you wish, yes.

428
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,520
The blue one,
you'll wear the blue one, ok?

429
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,960
A letter for Mortez? Michel.
We have a reservation for one room.

430
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,280
- Mr. Mortez. Hold on, I'll check.
- Go, quick!

431
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,840
Nothing on that name, I'm afraid.

432
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,640
- What time does the mail come in?
- 10 o'clock, Sir.

433
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,600
Very well, we'll be gone.

434
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,600
Michel,
all is well, we have a room.

435
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,360
- Michel Mortez...
- Sir.

436
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,640
From the radio.

437
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,440
- There, Sirs. Is that all?
- Yes, thank you.

438
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,000
- What's happening, Michel?
- I'm having a panic attack.

439
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,280
Lay down for five minutes,
it'll be over soon.

440
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,280
Two beds,
the night table in the middle,

441
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,840
with golden ornamentations,
the artwork,

442
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,920
the tiny little bathroom,

443
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,520
the shiny synthetique bedcover,

444
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,960
the smell, the fucking smell!

445
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,680
It's a hotel room.
I don't see the problem.

446
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,960
Rivetot, get me out of here.
I can't breathe, I'll scream.

447
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,800
Michel!

448
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,960
Michel, can I ask you a question?

449
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,440
Yes, go ahead.

450
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,520
Is it true that you were
Martine Carol's lover?

451
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,520
Who told you this?

452
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,760
Friends, at the radio.

453
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,560
They say it,
but nobody knows for sure.

454
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,120
What do you think?

455
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,200
I don't know.

456
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,920
If they say it,
it must be true.

457
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,760
Have you been
intimate with other actresses?

458
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,560
Singers, Dancers?

459
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,120
We weren't bored after the war.

460
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,560
- We weren't bored.
- I mean...

461
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,440
- Those who were famous?
- Also, yes.

462
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,440
But you're too young.

463
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,680
Do you dance?

464
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,240
Huh?

465
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,680
Don't you like dancing?

466
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,000
I do,
but, I mean, please...

467
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,160
- Fine. Should we go?
- Oh, no.

468
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,640
You had too much to drink.

469
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,680
Yes,
but it doesn't mean I can't dance.

470
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,840
You can drive, if you like.

471
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,920
No, thanks. Be kind.
Not tonight, I'm tired.

472
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,280
You're not funny.

473
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,960
We're always together,
yet we hardly know each other.

474
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,720
It's a funny feeling.
A strange sensation.

475
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,840
Yes, it's bizarre.

476
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,120
We don't know each other,
but we do like each other well.

477
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,880
Sure, Michel. Sure.

478
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,160
So, all is well.

479
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,720
Come, on, Michel.
It's three o'clock, I'm dead tired.

480
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,120
Quarter to. Do you think
that I can't read a watch?

481
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,880
Close the door a bit,
It's always open.

482
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,160
If you don't go out,
you'll get back by yourself.

483
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,960
Get out! Get out already!

484
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,440
Mortez isn't
completely knackered yet.

485
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,440
Have you combed through him yet?
Well, no, no.

486
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,120
He's still standing.

487
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,320
You're still here?

488
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,040
You're bonkers.
You've already lost enough tonight.

489
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,160
You don't know what you're doing.

490
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,840
Hep! 50 000 Francs, 50 mil.
Piss off!

491
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,760
You're so dissapointing,
when you're drunk.

492
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,600
You're not throwing away
50 grand, are you?

493
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,840
What does it look like,
you little shit?

494
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,320
I'm a lord.
Lord Mortez.

495
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,040
And Lord Mortez decided
to have fun tonight?

496
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,040
Chips!

497
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,400
Chips, damn it!

498
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,320
Chips!
Give me chips!

499
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,880
Lord Mortez is back.

500
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,680
Change this, young man,
Lord Mortez doesn't wait.

501
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,160
- He's not usually like this.
- "Not usually like this"?

502
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,880
What do you know
about how I am?

503
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,560
I'm a lord, a prince!

504
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,040
And you, Rivetot,
are just a piece of shit.

505
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,720
- Go on.
- Come on, Michel!

506
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,600
Roll it, youth.

507
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,440
Enough!

508
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,040
Come, on, Michel.
We're going back, now.

509
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,040
It's nice here,
don't you think?

510
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,120
Are you just coming through?

511
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,240
I got you a coffee.

512
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,040
Look out, it's hot.

513
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,040
Not too chatty, your friend.

514
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,960
Trust me,
he's better when he's quiet.

515
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,880
I see. Too snobbish to
speak to a pump attendant

516
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,600
- You know who it is, do you?
- No, should I?

517
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,280
- No, who is it?
- Michel Mortez, t h e Cat's Tongue.

518
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,040
What, the dork from the radio?

519
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,040
He's still around?

520
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,040
I didn't imagine him like this.
But on the radio,

521
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,280
you don't see his face.
Isn't he tired of it,

522
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,200
the same old shit
since 20 years?

523
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,680
No, he isn't tired of it.

524
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,880
When you love your job,
you can do it for a long time.

525
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,480
Mortez is a real professional.

526
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,880
That doesn't mean
he can't speak to a pump attendant.

527
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,840
- Should I check the oil?
- No.

528
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,600
You stick your nose
into this motor,

529
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,160
and I'll give you your due.

530
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,440
You'll drown it if you keep going.

531
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,560
I know her, one has to insist.
She does that when she's hot.

532
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,440
There, you see?

533
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,840
- Safe travels.
- Thanks.

534
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,160
Hi.

535
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,040
I don't believe it!

536
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,160
- Huh? What?
- Look at these idiots.

537
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,880
- Where?
- There, stop the car.

538
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,400
I'll tell them they're idiots.
They don't know it yet.

539
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,600
Leave them alone,
they don't bother anyone.

540
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,320
I don't care,
you can't be so stupid!

541
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,600
If they want to eat on the side,
it's their business.

542
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,600
- Not everyone goes to restaurants.
- That's not what I want.

543
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,120
But I'm sure that 20 meters further,

544
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,000
there's a meadow and
all you need for a picnic.

545
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,880
But no, they have to
sit right on the road!

546
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,720
They're idiots, I tell you.

547
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,760
You know, Michel,
it's your audience.

548
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,280
I owe you for the success
of this show,

549
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,760
and my audience,
who for over 20 years...

550
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,000
No, 20 year, 25 years...

551
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,480
follows, listens, encourages me.

552
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,320
I'll drink a toast to your fidelity.

553
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,600
Oh! Please.

554
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,000
Please.

555
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,280
With all those questions,
you must know plenty?

556
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,320
Oh, yes, of course.

557
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,320
If you allow me, I've prepared
some questions myself.

558
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,640
In fact, I thought of
sending them to the show.

559
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,160
I'd like to try them on you.

560
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,320
- You don't mind?
- Not at all.

561
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,560
"Which dancer,
born in St. Petersburg in 1885,

562
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,760
"naturalized british citizen,
star of the russian ballet,

563
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,440
"creator of Fokine's works"

564
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,760
"and great interpreter
of classical works?"

565
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,760
1885, you said?

566
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,600
Attention, Mr Mortez,

567
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,080
you only have 30 seconds.

568
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,000
That's regrettable.

569
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,200
Time's out.
Are you giving your Cat's Tongue?

570
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,320
Well, yes.
Forgive me, I have no idea.

571
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,640
It was Tamara Karsavina.

572
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,080
- You didn't know.
- The name sounds familiar.

573
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,760
I hope you'll be luckier
with the next question,

574
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,240
which will be about egyptology.

575
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,920
"Which name did
pharao Amenophis the fourth pick.."

576
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,440
- What time are you done?
- Nine thirty.

577
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,000
Are you doing anything later?

578
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,720
A letter arrived this morning.
I forgot to give it to you.

579
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,200
It comes from the radio.
It's for your friend.

580
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,440
- I'm sorry
- No worries.

581
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,040
Do you know how much trouble
fits into this small space?

582
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,200
Aren't you afraid of anything?

583
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,960
Do you want to earn 10 Francs?
I'll entrust you with a mission.

584
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,440
Secret.

585
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,480
Here.

586
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,200
Go.

587
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,240
So, have you thought about it?

588
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,800
I can treat you to a drink,
if you want.

589
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,240
So, he's bored,
the man with the stopwatch.

590
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,320
He's lost, all alone in this hole.
He needs a friend.

591
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,760
I love talking, so I figured...

592
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,760
I won't save the world
with my stopwatch.

593
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,480
But with me, you could
try to save it, ehi?

594
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,640
No, I was just saying it.
Not to chat you up.

595
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,520
You're in good shape tonight.

596
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,760
I love talking, too.
I'll meet you outside,

597
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,360
at nine thirty. Is that good?

598
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,760
Yes, yes, that's good.

599
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:12,400
Think about it
before you answer, Mr Mortez.

600
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,360
You can make no more mistakes

601
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,880
you already gave two wrong answers?

602
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,480
Do you think she's his wife?

603
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,520
Well, I'd tend to think she is.

604
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,680
Oh, no! Wrong again!

605
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,640
This charming lady isn't
the wife of our eminent notary.

606
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,960
She's René Manguy's wife,
our pharmacist.

607
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,920
To restore yourself,

608
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,920
tell us, who this charming creature

609
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,640
is married to.

610
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,360
Top.

611
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,200
And go.

612
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,360
Well, I think she is the wife

613
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,960
of this gentleman..
- Mr Mortez, it can't be!

614
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,920
You do it on purpose.

615
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,480
I told you

616
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,200
that our friend is already
married with Madam.

617
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,760
To my knowledge,
he's not a bigamist!

618
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,920
It was a trick.

619
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,080
She isn't married,
in fact, she's divorced.

620
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,120
Excuse me.

621
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:25,080
- I didn't want to hurt you.
- Don't be sorry.

622
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,120
You didn't know that
you're invited to the idiot's club.

623
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,480
Let's get up and
continue our game in the hall.

624
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,080
If you like dancing,
I found this nightclub.

625
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,840
Nice, we can have a drink.
And I'll drive you home afterwards.

626
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,800
Will you buy me a t-shirt
and ask me to try it on?

627
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,640
Sure, or not?

628
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,520
You won't know how to leave,
you'll beat around the bush.

629
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,960
It'll be three in the morning,
I'll be dead-tired.

630
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:06,200
We'll win time.
I'm in perfect shape now.

631
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,920
And given that I live
nearby it'll be quite easy.

632
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,080
What's the stopwatch say about it?

633
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,680
Mr Mortez,
my friends and I were thrilled.

634
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,080
- Call us...
- That's it. Goodbye.

635
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,200
They were happy to have us.

636
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,560
They'll say:
"Mr Mortez stayed here."

637
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,200
"The one from the radio?"
"Yes, he came for dinner."

638
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:29,240
- This is the countryside.
- I know that, I know.

639
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,400
I'll drop you off.

640
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,200
No, I'd like to get some air.

641
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,760
I insist. Did you get off
at William, the conquerer?

642
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,920
William, the conquerer...
Yes, that's it.

643
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,360
It's the only decent hotel.
The others stink.

644
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,760
Really?

645
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:51,560
Here you are.
Good luck with tomorrow's show.

646
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,360
- Thank you, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

647
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,960
Wake up the guardian.
You can't sleep outside.

648
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,520
Go ahead,
there must be a back-entrance.

649
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,800
No, wake him,
that's what he's there for.

650
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Go on.

651
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,680
Good night.

652
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,120
Goodbye.

653
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,360
- You'll laugh.
- I don't think so.

654
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,920
- It's the wrong hotel.
- Huh?

655
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,080
Wouldn't it be easier
with the right address?

656
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,960
Are you upset?

657
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,240
It's ridiculous.
I don't know what to say.

658
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,920
Don't say anything.

659
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,560
I was observing you
during the dinner.

660
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,640
You have something
that intrigues me.

661
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,840
How do you mean, "intrigue"?

662
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:22,080
I have the feeling that
you're very bashful, are you?

663
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,720
No, it's true,
women intimidate me.

664
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,400
I don't believe you.

665
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,520
Yes!
In front of you, for example...

666
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,640
I am shaken.

667
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,720
Me, too!

668
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,520
I like it, and you?

669
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,920
Ah, yes.

670
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,560
Your voice...

671
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,520
I'm very sensitive
to voices, naturally.

672
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,640
And yours is very particular.

673
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,600
I love it.

674
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,160
I was sure you'd be different
than your image.

675
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,440
- That's not very nice.
- No, why?

676
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,960
I read your memoirs,
you know?

677
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:18,400
- Oh! That crap!
- Why do you say that?

678
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:23,520
No, I found it to be
fast, original, rather well-written.

679
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,800
You should write another one,
you have talent.

680
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,800
I'm a radio-man,
you know, not a writer.

681
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,800
I'm sure
you're worth more than that.

682
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,360
You deserve better than
this traveling entertainer's life.

683
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,520
And you know it, don't you?

684
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,840
What do you know of me?
You can't understand.

685
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,600
I created this show.

686
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,320
It was born with me
and it'll die with me.

687
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,320
Do you know how many
listeners I have every day?

688
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,560
More than 3 million.

689
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,240
That astounds you, doesn't it?

690
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:04,400
So, go back to putting notes
into your books,

691
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,880
instead of feeling sorry for me.

692
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,600
Why are you like this?

693
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,840
Because I'm tired, miss.
So tired.

694
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,520
Leave me, then.

695
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,320
- I didn't want to hurt you.
- Too late.

696
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,040
Good night.

697
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,080
Can I have a drink?

698
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,320
With pleasure, Sir...

699
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,480
Mr Mortez.

700
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:24,280
- Forgive me, it's late.
- Well, that's what I'm here for.

701
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,880
- What can I offer you?
- A cognac.

702
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,480
Can I buy you one?

703
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,600
With pleasure.

704
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,480
I imagined this job more fun.

705
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,120
Girls don't fall to our feet
because we do radio.

706
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,880
We change city every day,
there is little opportunity.

707
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,200
Well, I prefer one-night-stands.

708
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,040
That turns me on!

709
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:22,040
- You really speak like a guy.
- Look out.

710
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,320
Maybe you just
slept with a transvestite.

711
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,120
Well, that's not funny. No.

712
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,200
I'm sure you're married, too.

713
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,560
- So little.
- What does that mean?

714
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,400
That means I still am,
but my wife hardly is.

715
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:40,960
So, you jerk off?

716
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,840
- Huh?
- It's funny, these things

717
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,440
you never want to tell.
You're ashamed, ehi?

718
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,600
No, but, well...

719
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,400
You're friend
doesn't fuck either?

720
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,840
I don't know,
I can hardly imagine him fucking.

721
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,440
Because he's your boss?

722
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,320
It's like with parents.

723
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,440
Have you ever imagined your father
having an orgasm? Shocking.

724
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,280
Stop it, you're chilling me.

725
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,520
- Some idea.
- You don't want to talk about it?

726
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,560
Yes, but...

727
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,680
I'll help you clean up?

728
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,240
Don't worry about the mess
worry about me.

729
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,240
You'll clean up later.

730
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:29,080
The Dardanelles aren't for wimps.

731
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,920
When it blows up inside,
you've got to hold tight.

732
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,440
A coward goes mad,

733
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,360
clicking and clacking
and shitting his pants.

734
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:43,040
I am a tough one,
Mr. Mortez, a real stud.

735
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,080
Bayonnet and canon,
one hit in the bum, one in the arse.

736
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,400
So? What do you say to that?

737
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,400
I say that I'm tired.
I'm going to sleep.

738
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,640
How about a little BJ, Michel?

739
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,520
A little... a little...

740
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,200
No, thanks.

741
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,840
You sleep all dressed now?

742
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,560
So I wouldn't disturb you.

743
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,200
- You're not sleeping?
- I am.

744
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,480
- A good night with the prominence?
- Exalting.

745
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,520
Good night, Michel.

746
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,280
Thank you.
We're getting up in 15 minutes.

747
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,120
Looking at this road,

748
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,640
Do you know
what they invented in Sweden?

749
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,440
They managed to
create a kind of white grass,

750
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,000
like chicory.

751
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:09,800
A plant without photosynthesis,
not green, but white.

752
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:14,360
They grew it on the side
and then in the middle of the road.

753
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,880
This way they don't need to
paint white stripes on the street.

754
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,800
Clever, isn't it?

755
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,800
Brilliant.

756
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:26,160
Poor fellow, you'd believe anything.

757
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:34,880
Are you sleeping?

758
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:38,560
What? No.
Just a little slump.

759
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,040
Should I drive?

760
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,520
- Pardon?
- Should I drive?

761
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,200
Oh, yes, please,
I didn't want to bother you...

762
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,920
Do you have a permit?
What if the police catches us...

763
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,720
Oh, no!

764
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,200
I believe you.

765
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,440
I only said that to avoid trouble.

766
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,600
- You look young on that picture.
- Thank you.

767
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:16,680
How old?

768
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:20,080
- 20.
- That explains it.

769
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,480
When you'll be 50
you'll still look the same,

770
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,960
rightfully so,
you look like 50 now.

771
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,800
Shall we continue being mean
or should we stop?

772
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,360
Michel Morteau. Mort...

773
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,360
- Mortez, isn't your real name?
- No,

774
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,200
it's a pseudonyme.

775
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,040
In those days,
South America was fashionable,

776
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,440
so I changed it from
Morteau to Mortez

777
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,520
to sound more exotic.

778
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,880
To sound exotic, you could have
changed your christian name.

779
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,880
Miguel. Miguel Mortez,
sound good.

780
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,600
You'd have been complimented
to speak spanish without an accent.

781
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,360
With that name,
you'd have been an operetta singer.

782
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,560
Like Luis Mariano.

783
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,360
I didn't think of that.
Life is terrible.

784
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,720
I should have met you sooner.

785
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,080
Are..are you in a bad mood?

786
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:21,600
- What? What's happening?
- Nothing. Sleep.

787
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,720
Enough. You've eaten enough!

788
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,440
There's a limit, you know?
Up, up! Pack up.

789
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,960
You're an embarrassment
to our country.

790
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,320
I love winter, just because
you're not out and about.

791
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,160
There should be
a fashion brigade forbidding

792
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,520
tracksuits outside
of soccer stadiums.

793
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,840
- You're hurting yourself, Michel.
- They're multiplying.

794
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,320
They should be deprived
of custody over there children,

795
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,160
no: we'll sterilize them!

796
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:10,400
Yes, come one.
We'll be late for the show.

797
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,040
You think that this
is my audience?

798
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,760
No, there's all those
having lunch at home.

799
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:17,960
Frenchmen!

800
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,920
You're crazy, Michel!

801
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:28,160
- Go on, start the car!
- Bloody car!

802
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,000
So?

803
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,200
She always does that,
when she's hot.

804
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,000
Holy shit!

805
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,880
- We're fucked, she's drowned.
- What do we do now?

806
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,160
What do you want to do?
We've broken down.

807
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,840
We'll hitchhike.
With all the equipment.

808
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,280
The show is in 45 minutes.
We're fucked.

809
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,400
Listen, Rivetot.

810
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,120
In 25 years,
I've never missed one show.

811
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,320
Sick, high fever...
never, have I let down

812
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,920
my audience.

813
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,200
I'm not going to let
a car run my life.

814
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,800
I'm sorry, Michel.

815
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,520
Don't move.

816
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:13,520
I'm sorry about earlier.
I don't know what came over me.

817
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,640
There, I'm Miguel Mort...
Michel Mortez, from the radio.

818
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,280
You know? The Cat's Tongue.

819
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,760
Our show is in 40 minutes.

820
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,520
We've a problem with our car.

821
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,840
So, I wonder

822
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,960
if you could help us out.

823
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,040
It's 12.45,
time for our live show

824
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,040
with Michel Mortez
and the Cat's Tongue.

825
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,560
Today you're in Brécances?

826
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:51,280
We're not in Brecances,
but about 20 km away.

827
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,200
In fact,
we're doing an experiment today

828
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,880
which will
enter into the annals of radio:

829
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:00,720
a completely improvised show,
in presence of

830
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,200
these charming vacationers,

831
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:06,160
who were quietly having lunch
on the side of the street.

832
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,240
Our first question is for Mr Gora,

833
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,240
our first candidate:
"German doctor and microbiologist

834
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,720
"born in Clausthal in 1843,
died in 1910,

835
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,440
"this great scientist
saved millions of human lives,

836
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,360
"discovering, in 1882,

837
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,120
"the bacteria of tuberculosis."

838
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,560
You have 30 seconds to answer.

839
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:31,960
- Top stop!
- Is he very famous?

840
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:36,160
Yes, very well-known.
The bacillus is named after him.

841
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,440
Could you stop eating
during the questions?

842
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,800
I don't know. Einstein?

843
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,080
No, it's not Einstein.
It was..

844
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,080
Robert Koch.

845
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:52,560
You never heard of
the Koch Bacillus?

846
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,560
I don't think so.
No, I haven't, sorry.

847
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,400
That's ok, Mr. Gora.
Here's an easier question.

848
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:04,520
"Which monumental statue
was built by Batholdi?"

849
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,280
Top stop!
I can give you a hint,

850
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,240
the statue stands in
the harbour of New York.

851
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,240
Hm, I don't know. No.

852
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,360
We're getting
to the end of our show.

853
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:16,480
Our candidates
weren't too lucky today,

854
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,920
alas, not answering,
any of our questions.

855
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,680
Here's back to our studios.

856
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,680
back to Paris!

857
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,600
Thank you. Really.
You saved our show.

858
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,080
Welcome.

859
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,760
Wait.
You're not leaving now, are you?

860
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,920
You're having desert with us.

861
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,760
With pleasure.

862
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:44,560
You're show is great.
My wife and I listen to it.

863
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:48,120
Even in sport questions,
I never know the answer.

864
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,640
Sir!
There's a message for Mr. Mortez.

865
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,840
He has to call Mr. Gaultier
before five PM this evening.

866
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,240
- Here's the number.
- Oh, I know his number.

867
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,160
He doesn't seem too jolly.

868
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,520
Yes, Rivetot, here, Mr. Gaultier.

869
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:19,400
He's not here,
but he asked me to call you.

870
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,960
What?

871
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,000
No, but...

872
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:28,160
You can't
cancel the show so abruptly.

873
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,160
You'll kill him.
Leave him a few days, at least.

874
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,680
No, we never received your letters.

875
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,520
No messages, nothing.

876
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:42,440
Why would we have called?
We didn't know.

877
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,040
Well.

878
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,480
I'll speak to him when he returns.
He'll call you.

879
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,280
Alright.

880
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:01,080
Yes, just one thing,
you're a bastard.

881
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:03,720
Goodbye, Mr. Gaultier.

882
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,520
You know, today's show
really cheered me up.

883
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,000
I didn't realize it,

884
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:15,400
but the idea
of improvising is pure genius.

885
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,240
Not like the purr of
a prepared candidate.

886
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,800
- Don't you find? No?
- Yes, sure.

887
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:26,840
- You don't seem enthusiastic.
- Yes, I loved it.

888
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,040
- You don't mind my coat?
- Ah! Sorry.

889
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,440
I'm seeing Gaultier friday.
I have some suggestions.

890
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,520
The best would be
to do this on TV.

891
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,560
Imagine: Surprise candidates,
live, on TV?

892
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,720
It's good that
surprise candidate idea.

893
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,080
I'd call it,..
The Surprise Candidate.

894
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,120
Oh! I know someone who'll
be surprised in Paris on friday.

895
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,240
Me, too.

896
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:40,320
"Mexican politician,
born in 1880,

897
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,920
"He rose up the peones
tr ying to make an agrarian reform,

898
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,920
"but was killed in 1919.

899
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,920
"Marlon Brando incarnated him
in the movie about his life."

900
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,800
- Do you know who it is?
- No, I don't know? Who?

901
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:55,040
You're not even looking.

902
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:59,160
I am, but I don't know.
I'm not going to think for hours.

903
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:01,360
As a hint,
I'll give you his initials:

904
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:05,360
- E, Z.
- "E, Z"? That's not helping!

905
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,520
Etienne Zaza?

906
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,160
Eugène Zanzibar?

907
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:13,480
- She's dead, get rid of it?
- It was about

908
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,080
Emiliano Zapata.
It's really easy.

909
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,080
No, keep that one.
I like it a lot.

910
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:28,280
Go! When I raise my arm,
you cheer as much as you can.

911
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,280
Attention! 1, 2, 3!

912
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,800
That's a bit soft.
Lateron, you're going to...

913
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,360
- Do you think it will be ok?
- I don't know, we'll see.

914
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,160
It's going to have to.

915
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,040
Hello, hello, hello.

916
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:51,120
Attention! 1, 2, 3!

917
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,480
Something's wrong,
there aren't many people,

918
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:01,680
but I believe quality
replaced quantity.

919
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,160
It's because of Bias Bicycle.
There all down there.

920
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,720
No big deal.

921
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:10,440
They seem nice,
I'm happy to be here.

922
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,640
It reminds me of my beginnings.
Hello, my friends.

923
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,440
Happy to be here?

924
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:20,160
On the air in two minutes,
Michel.

925
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:25,640
So, we got out
all our little equipment?

926
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,840
I suppose so.

927
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,880
What's your plan, Rivetot?
What the hell are you doing?

928
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,440
What do you mean?

929
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,120
Why are you doing all this?

930
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,560
To avoid telling me that
the show's been cancelled?

931
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,840
What are you doing tomorrow
and the day after?

932
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,320
Another fake show
with fake candidates,

933
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,840
and a fake pensionary audience

934
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,960
that you picked up
at the local elderly home?

935
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,120
- Let me explain...
- Never mind.

936
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,880
I know everything.

937
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,200
How long have you known?

938
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,880
Shit!

939
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:13,160
Don't worry.
It wasn't in vain.

940
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,680
We'll do your show.

941
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:20,120
Erbussonais,

942
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:23,160
Erbussonaises,
how are you feeling?

943
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,680
Hidden in the folds
of the Perche hills,

944
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,960
Erbusson is a mideval town

945
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:35,200
with a very rich past,

946
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,720
celebrated
for its food specialties...

947
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:59,480
Yes, yes, hello.
Hello, it's me.

948
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:03,240
Oh, my love, I'm so happy
to hear your voice.

949
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,800
A day without you is a lost day.

950
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,720
Well, I'm coming back tonight.

951
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,320
No, no nothing's wrong.
I'll explain later.

952
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,280
So, I'll be there
before you leave for Buenos Aires.

953
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:21,600
No! I'll explain.

954
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,840
I love you, sweetheart.

955
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:30,040
I realize
that I miss you more each day.

956
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:33,440
Oh, no. Shit!

957
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,680
Michel! Hello, madam?

958
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:46,040
- He's ...
- At the fourth top it will be...

959
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:50,320
13.44.

960
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:01,040
13.44 and ten seconds,

961
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:08,760
13 h 44 and twenty seconds,

962
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:10,320
Are you ok?

963
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,160
Sure.

964
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:30,760
So? Did you see Gaultier?

965
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:36,200
Let's have a drink?
It's on me.

966
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,840
The adventurers are back.

967
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:45,560
So, Mr. Mortez,
still at ease?

968
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,360
- What are you having?
- I don't care.

969
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,680
Two small cognacs,
please, Gilles.

970
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:00,440
I wanted to tell you...
I find it revolting!

971
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,920
What's the matter now?

972
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,760
We keep going until christmas,
but only every other day.

973
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,200
Pick me up tomorrow morning,
at six o clock at my house. Bye.

974
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,000
Where are you heading?
Should I drop you?

975
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:20,720
I got the new CX.

976
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,200
You know, the new, the Citroën!

977
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,880
How does this rubbish stop?

978
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,560
Ah, finally.

979
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:53,720
Michel?

980
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:08,360
Are you there?

981
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,720
Michel? It's Rivetot.

982
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,760
- Let's go, Rivetot?
- Michel!

983
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,080
Are you well?

984
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,440
Let's go, Rivetot?

985
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,280
Bus seats, power steering,
hydropneumatic suspensions...

986
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:03,880
With this car, I don't mind

987
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,920
traveling across France.

988
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,040
I love new cars.

989
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,720
It smells new.

990
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,360
See this? Electric windows!

991
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,080
Some fresh air?
Ask me.

992
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:27,520
It's like a new toy for a child.
Great, isn't it?

993
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,160
Well, I'll close it,
or you'll catch cold.

994
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,320
Lower the window,
you trapped my hair.

995
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,960
Sorry.

996
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,480
Attention!

997
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,360
It's quiet, ehi?

998
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,640
No, this is not how you dim it.

999
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,200
I think this new rhythm
is excellent for the show.

1000
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,200
It'll allow me to prepare things.
You understand?

1001
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:09,480
Yes, you had gotten to
a sort of saturation?

1002
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:13,760
The listeners will answer this,
but saturated, no, never.

1003
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,600
- Michel, we have to go.
- I'm coming.

1004
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:20,640
I'll see you later?
Yes, later.

1005
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:24,600
We're well-prepared,
I think it'll be a great show.

1006
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:26,480
After doing this for 26 years,

1007
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,640
it would be a shame to
make a mistake today.

1008
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:33,360
- You're not wearing a tie?
- This is radio, you know.

1009
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:38,520
- I'm saying it because, usually...
- Don't worry, everything's fine.

1010
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,800
- Let me introduce you to the mayor.
- Oh, yes.

1011
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,240
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Mayor.

1012
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,680
In three minutes!

1013
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:52,520
- After the ads, roll the credits.
- OK.

1014
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:33,880
Ready? Two minutes!

1015
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,920
No. Mortez isn't here.

1016
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:40,080
- Where is he?
- I don't know. Haven't seen him.

1017
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,680
He better hurry.
I've started the first reel.

1018
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,640
No, wait, here he...

1019
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,320
No, it isn't him.

1020
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,680
- Where is he?
- I don't know, he took off.

1021
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,680
- Don't you see?
- See what?

1022
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,800
He lost it, dickhead!

1023
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,520
Well, Madam...

1024
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:30,360
for a superbonus of
200 Million cents...

1025
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,400
Stay calm.

1026
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:35,040
I'd like to thank
all TV viewers

1027
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,400
who are watching today.

1028
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,240
I'm keeping you in suspense,
I'm sorry.

1029
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:45,200
So, the question of
200 million cents,

1030
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:49,520
you're going to tell me...

1031
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,080
I don't have my board.

1032
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,680
Where's my board? Rivetot!

1033
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:01,240
Rivetot!
Where is that Rivetot?

1034
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,520
Don't get upset, madam,

1035
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:06,040
we're going to
find the question right away.

1036
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,840
Rivetot, my tiny...

1037
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:12,640
We're on the air,
my board gone, where are you?

1038
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,920
Rivetot! My little Rivetot!

1039
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,520
Yes, it's that camera,
madam, indeed.

1040
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:21,000
The tiredness, the waste!

1041
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,640
Where did he go?

1042
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:26,240
Oh, Rivetot, this is ridiculous!

1043
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,960
Live, on television, by god...

1044
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,960
Top.
Sir, you have thirty seconds.

1045
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:30,560
The gentleman doesn't know.
But madam may.

1046
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,840
Let's see. AOC, yes.

1047
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,120
Congratulations, Miss.
You won.

1048
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,680
AOC,
protected designation of origin.

1049
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,960
Madam, it was the wrong answer.

1050
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:45,400
You had to enounce properly.

1051
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,280
It's only a game.

1052
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,160
Miss, you will receive

1053
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:53,120
a bottle of
the wonderful Château-Malescasse.

1054
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:57,360
Now to a more difficult question.

1055
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:00,240
"What does chaptalisation mean?"

1056
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,520
Chaptalisation, does anyone know?

1057
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:05,240
There? Nobody knows?

1058
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:07,800
- Chaptalisation!
- I know it.

1059
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,400
He knows? Really?

1060
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,960
Well, let's hear...

1061
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:15,400
Ah! Shit, Rivetot!

1062
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:17,840
What are you doing here?

1063
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,960
It's the second time
that I steal something.

1064
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,840
The first time, I was nine.

1065
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,840
All children do it,
but I got caught.

1066
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,400
I'm useless.

1067
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,840
To find myself in this dump...

1068
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:46,600
- You're still at the radio?
- No.

1069
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,360
It's called "Redundancy".

1070
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:53,080
There was a first cleanup,
and I was in it.

1071
01:21:53,720 --> 01:21:55,840
It was revolting!

1072
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:01,400
- What will you do now?
- I don't know.

1073
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,440
I stay here, I wait.

1074
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,000
And you?

1075
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:12,560
Always doing my patrols:
one day here, one day there.

1076
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:17,160
Advertising animation
and store promotions,

1077
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,520
I don't have time to get bored.

1078
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:23,320
There. And now, get lost.
Don't let me catch you here again.

1079
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:26,240
Next time, I'll break your bones!

1080
01:22:26,360 --> 01:22:28,120
Hey, Sir, take it easy!

1081
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,440
M. Rivetot is a friend.
You've no right to speak to him.

1082
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:32,880
Be polite!

1083
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,240
Last week, I was in Nantes
for the trailers.

1084
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,680
I explain
what I do, games, t-shirts,

1085
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:44,440
and whatnot,

1086
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:48,240
he says to me: "Mr. Mortez,
I'm an industrial,

1087
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,680
"not a circus-man."

1088
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:53,240
I answer: "Sir,
I am a circus-man,

1089
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,560
"I'll sell your trailers for you."

1090
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:59,560
The next day,
his book was full of orders,

1091
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:01,680
he couldn't ship them all.

1092
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,560
And your wife?

1093
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,400
I finally accepted the divorce.
I live alone, but I'm ok.

1094
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,400
No! Is that yours?

1095
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:25,840
You don't waste time!

1096
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:29,720
- How long have you had it?
- Six months, it's the third one.

1097
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:35,120
I wanted to contact you,
but you moved.

1098
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:38,600
- Nobody knew where you were.
- I know, I know.

1099
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,560
I preferred
to dissapear for a moment.

1100
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,320
And your health?

1101
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,600
Good. I was just tired.

1102
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:52,240
In the head, too, I think.

1103
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:56,840
Aren't you ever bored,
alone in this big car?

1104
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,560
What?
You mean if I miss you?

1105
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:06,400
Sometimes, yes,
then I pick up a hitch-hiker.

1106
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,120
She's beautiful.

1107
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,840
Wanna try it?

1108
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:29,960
For someone who hates driving,
you were really good.

1109
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:33,040
I'd spend my life
in a car like this.

1110
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,280
You still see red dogs?

1111
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:41,840
Never.

1112
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:47,720
Wanna see one in Bordeaux?
I've got to be there tonight.

1113
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:57,280
You're taking a piss?

1114
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:00,560
"Not taking a piss."

1115
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,600
Oh! Hell!

1116
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,400
I don't believe it!
When are we leaving?

1117
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,560
Now.

1118
01:25:15,040 --> 01:25:16,040
Oh! Hell!

1119
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:22,000
- Say, you were living here?
- I was.

1120
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,840
So,
take a good look at the landscape,

1121
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,640
you won't see it for some time!

1122
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:39,920
