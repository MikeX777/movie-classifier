1
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:29,026
You sure everything's okay?

2
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,066
Of course.

3
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,580
Who's there?

4
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:49,500
Sorry, Pops, it's just me.

5
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,122
Mikey...

6
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,749
what are you doing here?

7
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,001
There was a problem
with the plane

8
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,653
and it was overbooked
and they said that, you know,

9
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,042
to wait around
for a little while,

10
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,031
'cause they're probably
gonna bump some people, but

11
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,217
it's probably
gonna be hours, so...

12
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:07,393
Anyway, I just figured
I'd leave tomorrow instead.

13
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,597
Hey, Flo, look who's here.

14
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,683
Flo.

15
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:18,487
Hey, Ma. Hi.

16
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,984
Hi.

17
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,861
What are you doing?

18
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,114
There were problems
with the plane, and...

19
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,640
they were gonna wait around
for other people

20
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:28,452
to get bumped.

21
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,203
Anyway, just go back to sleep.

22
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,751
- Everything's okay, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:36,422
Okay. I'm glad we're gonna
see you one more day.

24
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,922
You know what?

25
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,091
I'm just gonna put you down
for one second, okay?

26
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,510
I'll be right back,
just gonna grab that.

27
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,305
Stay right there, okay?

28
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,975
Mikey.

29
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,557
Where are you?

30
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,233
Yeah, yeah,
that airline's awful.

31
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,687
When will you be back?

32
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,115
What was that?
I missed the last part.

33
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,283
Oh yeah, hmm, fine.

34
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,952
Can't you hear?
Those are tears of joy.

35
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,707
Okay. Good night, Michael.

36
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,331
See you tomorrow.

37
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,536
Love you too.

38
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,301
Okay, up we go.

39
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,253
That's over.

40
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,770
Ma?

41
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,849
Yeah, I just...

42
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,811
I was on hold with them
for, like, an hour.

43
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,216
I don't know,
they kept transferrin' me

44
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,822
like, ten times, and finally,

45
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,866
they put me on
with their headquarters in

46
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,569
Georgia or India,
I have no idea,

47
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,782
where it's very far away.

48
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,787
Yeah.

49
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,996
Um... no, they said that...

50
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,817
they said that I could
call back tomorrow morning

51
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:13,209
or buy a new ticket.

52
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,044
Yeah, tomorrow morning.

53
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,053
I don't either.

54
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,762
Um...

55
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:36,983
No... yeah, I'm gonna come back
as soon as I can.

56
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,818
Yes.

57
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,287
Yeah.

58
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,834
No, I...

59
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:57,546
Just will you give Ana
a kiss for me, please?

60
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,131
I love you.

61
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,438
Mom, that smells good.

62
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,064
Thank you.

63
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,266
You're welcome.

64
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,195
- Great, thanks.
- You're welcome, Mom.

65
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,122
Okay.

66
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,619
Could you try the dressing?

67
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,825
Yeah.

68
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,918
How is it?

69
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:24,052
Mmm...

70
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,143
Okay, come on.

71
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,766
Oh my God, it's good. +Okay.

72
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,643
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

73
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,520
Okay, would you get the dishes?

74
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,521
Yes.

75
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,944
Okay, and the forks
and the napkins.

76
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,735
And when's your flight?

77
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,070
I don't know, the whole thing
has been so annoying.

78
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,532
I just explained
the whole thing to Laura.

79
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,742
They canceled my flight,
I was on hold forever,

80
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,998
they kept switching me
to all the different places,

81
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,670
and I don't know.

82
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,465
So I'm probably gonna go
tonight or tomorrow, or...

83
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,882
it's gonna be fine.

84
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,249
And I talked to Laura,
it's fine,

85
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,840
and they're both good,

86
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,283
they had a great day
at the park today,

87
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,264
- so it's good.
- Okay.

88
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,059
Yeah. +All right. I hope...

89
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,011
Okay. Yeah.

90
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,027
Did you put vinegar in this?

91
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,482
Yes.

92
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,909
Vinegar is my enemy.

93
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:31,331
Well, he likes it.

94
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,408
And anyway,

95
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,494
don't have it, it's okay.

96
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,626
It's... you don't need the oil.

97
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:56,231
I'm making these things happen
with projected light.

98
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,935
Um... with the same...

99
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,316
You think you're seeing
the same things are happening

100
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,114
in terms of, uh,

101
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,817
making things appear,
not appear,

102
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:11,371
on the picture plane.

103
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,199
Wow.

104
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:19,710
I's... anyway, this is
really, really beautiful.

105
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,791
It's amazing.

106
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:27,254
The space is 50, so good.

107
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,259
This is a painting.

108
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,597
I don't know about a paint...

109
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,554
I wouldn't call this a painting.

110
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:39,607
Why not?

111
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,605
Doesn't use pigment?

112
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,778
No, it isn't that.

113
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,947
Robert.
- What?

114
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,150
Hey, man.

115
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:55,036
Yeah, it's... fuckin' airplane.

116
00:13:55,126 --> 00:14:00,246
Dude, I wanna get back,
it's freezing here.

117
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,775
No, I can... I can
take care of everything

118
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,381
when I get back there,

119
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:05,209
be back on Tuesday,

120
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:06,509
or even if I'm back Wednesday,

121
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,337
I'm sure I won't be, but...

122
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,968
even if I...
Probably be there Tuesday.

123
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:14,393
But, um...

124
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,274
Um...

125
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,523
Do me a favor.

126
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,196
If anyone asks, you just kinda...

127
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,899
Will you cover for me?

128
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,154
Thanks, man.

129
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,362
I appreciate it.

130
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,394
Mad Mike!

131
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,604
Mad Mike.

132
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:15,828
Honey, did you call me? No, Ma.

133
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,933
What?

134
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,669
Brigitte.

135
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,176
"What the fuck is your problem?"

136
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,812
"Fine, so I said
pretty fucked-up things.

137
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:05,959
You know I didn't mean them.

138
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,566
I hear all the shit
you say, like..."

139
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,650
"I didn't do that shit to you.

140
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,198
You want me to hate you?

141
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,525
Well, I do.

142
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,702
I fuckin' hate you 50 much..."

143
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,852
“...right now for what
you're putting me through,

144
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,992
and I'm sure you're just
totally getting off

145
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,873
"on watching me suffer,
aren't you?"

146
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:32,800
I hate you for we've never met.

147
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,717
"Why don't you fucking give up

148
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,966
on trying to make me
so jealous?"

149
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,344
I love you so much.

150
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,050
"You treat me like...

151
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,805
you treat me like shit.""

152
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,480
<i>You just won't get, get over it.</i>

153
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,935
Brigitte.

154
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,770
"You never gave a shit...
No, obviously not."

155
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,025
"The problem is,
I'm getting sick

156
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,657
of trying to figure out
what I did that was so wrong.”

157
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:09,415
'Cause I knew [ loved you.

158
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,246
You stupid whore.

159
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:20,464
You stu... you stupid whore.

160
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,010
Always asking for more

161
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,562
Mikey?
- Sorry, Dad.

162
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,104
Is that the radio?

163
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,977
No, I just found a...

164
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,935
some old songs from high school.

165
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,489
Please play quieter, okay?
- Yeah, okay.

166
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:54,585
Well, at first, it wasn't true.

167
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,258
Fuck, fuck... fuck, fuck you,

168
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,886
I hope you die too.

169
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:10,389
You were my first,
I'll be your last.

170
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:18,193
You'll never forget
our early past.

171
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,158
You'll never forget,

172
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:26,488
never forget
all the lies and deceit.

173
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:32,411
You call me after school,
you say you're not well.

174
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:42,672
When I ask what's wrong,
you say you can't tell, tell.

175
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:50,765
Well, fuck, fuck, fuck you,
I hope you die too.

176
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,401
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck you,

177
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,856
I hope you die too.

178
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:06,449
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck you.

179
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:13,502
Better find someone new

180
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:14,648
Laura, will you stop yelling?

181
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,915
Just stop yelling.

182
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:22,218
No, I don't understand
what you're saying.

183
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:27,174
Yeah, well,

184
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,553

185
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,111
No, I'm just gonna stay
a little bit longer, okay?

00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,940

189
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:51,498
Oh my God.

190
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,644
Laura, do you know
what it's like

191
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,706

192
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:08,056
I'm sor... I'm sorry.

00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,554

Can you hear me?

218
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,151
Hello?

219
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:35,199
Customer, can you hear me?

220
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,016
Okay, we seem to have
trouble with the line,

221
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,579
so, customer,
if you can hear me,

222
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,836
I'm going to have to ask you
to place your call again,

223
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:48,927
I'm sor...

224
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,862
Hey, Ma.

225
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,197
Hi.

226
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,497
You startled me.

227
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,245
What are you doing?

228
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:24,168
Nothin'. Sorry.

229
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,790
Everything's okay?

230
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,872
Yeah, everything's fine now.

231
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,207
I talked to Laura, and actually,

232
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,294
we sorted everything out.

233
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,627
She... she suggested
at the end of the conversation,

234
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,258
she said, "You should just
stay an extra night," so...

235
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:36,555
And I'm gonna do that,

236
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,508
and I can be with you guys
a little bit longer.

237
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,014
So probably leave, like,
Wednesday or something.

238
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:43,267
And things are okay
with your job?

239
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:45,477
It's fine, they emailed me
everything a little bit ago

240
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:46,711
and I've already started on it,

241
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:49,443
so everything's good.

242
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,112
How is it out there?

243
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,563
It's freezing.

244
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,649
I just came back
from the Food Emporium.

245
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,199
I just ran into Maggie.

246
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,618
She said Dante is back,

247
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:03,667
he's got his own job
and he seems to be doing well.

248
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,619
Wow.

249
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,546
Yeah.

250
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,793
I'd love to see...

251
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,361
Maybe I'll do a little bit
more work up here

252
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:12,716
and then go over and see him.

253
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:15,010
- Great. Okay. Good.
- All right.

254
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,634
I'm gonna go start some lunch,

255
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,073
Bye, Ma.

256
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:41,495
Where you going?

257
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,119
I'm going over to Dante's.

258
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,040
Why now?

259
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,312
Because I just finished
some work.

260
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,792
I'm gonna go over and say hi.

261
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,211
You need more clothes,

262
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,067
-you need a hat and scarf.
<I'm fine, it's two blocks away.

263
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,331
Put on something...

264
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:54,167
-it's really, really cold.
+I love you.

265
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,376
Bye, Ma!

266
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,557
It's cold.

267
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:02,758
I'm fine.

268
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:05,094
Come on, I'll give you a scarf!

269
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:07,772
You need gloves!

270
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:16,652
It's not California!

271
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,857
Fuck.

272
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:34,647
Oh, yo! What's up, bro?

273
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,851
Hey.

274
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,496
Okay, dude!

275
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:52,668
What's going on, brother?

276
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,789
I'm good, how are you?

277
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,087
Good, man, how you been?

278
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,289
I'm good, I just...

279
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,527
I'm in town for a business trip

280
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,028
and I was gonna leave
a couple days ago,

281
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,589
but I ended up staying, so
I'm here for a little bit.

282
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,671
Businessman, what's going on?

283
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,597
Come on back, come on.

284
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,345
Hey, Mom, look who's here.

285
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,142
Hi, Nan.

286
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:17,231
I, uh, saw
the Blimpies out there.

287
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,232
I know, man,
that's some kind of fuckin'

288
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:22,987
ritzy-titsy, you know,
coffee shop now.

289
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,942
It's a new New York,
and I just...

290
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,368
I been here the whole time,

291
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:27,786
I can't even get adjusted to it.

292
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,956
You must be, like,
in total shock over this shit.

293
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:35,502
So what was it like in there?

294
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:38,502
Ugh, man, the fuckin' worst.

295
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:40,299
I'm never goin' back.

296
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,671
18 months.

297
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:42,877
But you know what?

298
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,837
I'm not sorry I went.

299
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,798
Yeah, 'cause it built me up.

300
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,508
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it made me see

301
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:50,468
a whole different
aspect of life,

302
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,929
a whole different way
of running my life.

303
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:55,731
At first, I was just
a lethargic, you know,

304
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,399
had no direction.

305
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,648
But I started running
and I started, you know,

306
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,025
thinking there was
a way out of all this mess.

307
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,072
And after the running,
I started lifting weights

308
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,820
and I started...
My mind got right

309
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:10,030
and everything kinda just
fell into place, you know?

310
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,830
Good.

311
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,499
Hi, Mikey. How are you?

312
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,950
I'm good, how are you?

313
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,911
I heard that
you're in California.

314
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,005
Yeah.

315
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,546
How is it there? +It's good.

316
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,123
It's good, it's really good.

317
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,459
- Are you married yet?
- Married... have a kid.

318
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:28,172
Yeah, Mom,
Mikey's not a virgin anymore.

319
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,634
- Well, nice to see you.
- You too.

320
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:34,391
Yo, man, you're not gonna
believe what I found.

321
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,278
Got it.

322
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,952
Close your eyes.

323
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,834
You remember this?

324
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,665
Yes.

325
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,842
Watch... watch, here it comes,
here comes the knockout.

326
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,671
Hearns is smiling
but he's taking shots.

327
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,427
Watch this... pow, bitch!

328
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:14,510
Hearns turns his back,
takes another right.

329
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,766
Watch this, one more time,
you gotta see this.

330
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:25,192
Watch this,
watch the right hand.

331
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,898
Here it comes, here it comes...

332
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,029
Hearns is smiling
but he's taking shots.

333
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:29,779
Bam!

334
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,531
Another right hand!

335
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,238
Hearns turns his back,
takes another right.

336
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,745
Look, he's going down,
he's going down! He's out.

337
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,418
Hearns is down in the third row
and on his back.

338
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,245
And he's not gonna get up.

339
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,001
.I don't believe.

340
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,925
Tommy Hearns tries to get up
and he's...

341
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,925
One more time, come on,
we gotta see this again.

342
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,394

350
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,645
No, I won't be in Paris
for some time.

351
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,228

to clean up here first.

352

00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,674

I'm actually
at my parents' house.

356
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,506
Yeah, listen, I didn't wanna
say anything to you before,

357
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,773
but, um... my mom...
And she's fine,

she's gonna be fine, but, uh...

she's been in the hospital,

360
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,828
and...

361
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,456
Thanks.

362
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:29,789
No, I just... I'd like
to stay until they know every...

363
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:32,466
The results and what's going on.

364
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,932
<i>Yeah... will tell her.</i>

365
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,680
You... you too.

366
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,887
Thanks.

367
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,454
NPR's Jamie Taraday reports.

368
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,085
There's been widespread
sectarian cleansing

369
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,712
by both Sunni
and Shi'ite militias

370
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,510
since civil war erupted...

371
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:18,235
You never make me pay, man,
you know what I mean, bro?

372
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:49,103
Hey, uh... hi, sorry.

373
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,100
I was wondering if maybe...

374
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:53,228
I have some friends over here,

375
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:57,437
I was hoping maybe you could
possibly buy us some beer?

376
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,191
I don't know if that's...

377
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,239
It's these guys over here.

378
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,211
Hey.

379
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,586
- Thank you.
- Sure. I, uh...

380
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,714
I got some paper bags
in there, so...

381
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,590
Okay, cool, dude. Thanks.

382
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,139
Thanks.

383
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,704
All right,

384
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,287
Mikey?

385
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,459
Hey!

386
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:01,253
I tried phoning you before

387
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,080
but your phone wasn't working.

388
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,007
I know, I turned it off
by accident.

389
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,381
We just finished dinner.

390
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:11,054
Would you like some food?
I could bring you in some food.

391
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,178
No, I'm good,
I had some falafel, and...

392
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,636
Are you okay?

393
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,935
Good.

394
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,605
Could you come and sit with us?

395
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,354
I think I'm just...
I should go lie down.

396
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,809
Come.

397
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,440
I've been waiting
to see you all day.

398
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,862
Come and sit down.

399
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:31,863
No, no, no, it's okay,
I'm gonna... my stomach...

400
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:32,953
the falafel...

401
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,159
Please come and sit down.

402
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:38,707
I could make you some tea.

403
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:45,502
Come on, please?

404
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:49,551
I... okay.

405
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,511
Okay. I'll be right back.

406
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:03,102
Mikey.

407
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,307
Dad.

408
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,874
Your tea is ready.

409
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,084
Wow.

410
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:21,393
And just have
a little bit of brownie.

411
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,696
New York, New York.

412
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:25,449
The number for Brigitte Sidell.

413
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,956
S-I-D-E-L-L.

414
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:41,466
Okay, how 'bout a Sidell on...
Jane Street?

415
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,392
I don't know, Mr. and Mrs...

416
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,726
Okay, thanks.

417
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,779
Hello?

418
00:42:56,866 --> 00:43:00,029
Miss... Miss Sidell?

419
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,455
I don't understand
what happened.

420
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,989
-Probably...
-Things were working okay

421
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,541
and then it just stopped.

422
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:19,253
Let's try another Ethernet cord.

423
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:21,338
That's probably the problem.

424
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,971
Good morning, Mikey.

425
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:27,552
Good morning.

426
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,729
Would you like some breakfast?

427
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,557
I can make some hot cereal?

428
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:33,233
No, no, no, I gotta go,

429
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,686
I have a huge conference call
for work,

430
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:40,445
it's this really big,
big, big deal that we've been...

431
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:43,527
I'm gonna close on, so.

432
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,531
I'm gonna...

433
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,738
How about some coffee, some tea?

434
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,621
No, no, no, I'm gonna just...
I gotta do all this work, so,

435
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,997
so much work stuff.

436
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,185
Mikey?

437
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:14,516
Yeah?

438
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,102
- Is everything okay?
- Yes, Ma.

439
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,153
Are you sure? Mm-hm,

440
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,948
Can I get you something?

441
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,365
No.

442
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,069
How 'bout some coffee, some tea,
something?

443
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:29,828
N-no, Ma, I'm just...
I'm in here.

444
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,703
Please. Ma!

445
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,956
- Are you really okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just in...

446
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,037
I'm in here.

447
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,420
You don't sound okay.

448
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:40,625
Ma?

449
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,509
I'm worried about you.

450
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,342
Okay, gimme two minutes, Mom.

451
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:55,561
I have some cold cereal?

452
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:59,440
Raisin bran, granola?

453
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:10,076
Okay.

454
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,374
Mikey?

455
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,044
What time is
your conference call?

456
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,588
It's been canceled.

457
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,573
I'm back!

458
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,382
What's up?

459
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:53,596
What's the matter?

460
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,291
Mikey?

461
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,415
Mikey?
- Yeah?

462
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,416
Could you come down, please?

463
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,293
We wanna talk with you.

464
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:29,173
I'm doing work for my job, Dad.

465
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,424
Please come down.

466
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,551
We really need to talk with you.

467
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,849
All right,
I'll be down in a minute.

468
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,708
Mikey.

469
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,090
Okay. What's up?

470
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,145
Is there anything I can get you?

471
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:25,601
Some coffee, tea?

472
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:29,187
No... what is it, what is this?

473
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,363
Is this an intervention?

474
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,908
No.

475
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,109
Some soup?

476
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,374
We're concerned, Mikey.

477
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,670
We like having you here,

478
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,339
you know we like
having you visit,

479
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:51,714
we enjoy it.

480
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:55,047
So what's the problem?

481
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:58,054
You're supposed to be here for a
few days, and it's much longer.

482
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:00,135
Something's wrong, and, uh,

483
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:02,596
we'd like you to tell us
what it is.

484
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,476
Please, Mikey.

485
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:05,773
Nothing.

486
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:09,902
Nothing.

487
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:11,821
Something's happening.

488
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:27,291
Don't you need to return home
to your family, to your work?

489
00:49:30,301 --> 00:49:32,417
Are you asking me to leave?

490
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:37,597
No, it's okay,
'cause if you are,

491
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:40,141
you just have to ask,
and I'll go.

492
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,470
No, no, sit down, sit down.

493
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,559
We just want you
to speak with us.

494
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,395
Did something happen at home?

495
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,276
With Laura?

496
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,513
Is there somebody else?

497
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,854
I knew it.

498
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:32,318
How could she, with a newborn?

499
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,028
It's not all her fault.

500
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:38,858
There's other factors...
involved.

501
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,910
There always are.

502
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,284
What happened?

503
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:49,497
You don't have to speak,
it's okay.

504
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:52,964
It's all right.

505
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,341
You can stay here
as long as you want.

506
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:14,694
I think I'm gonna go outside,
get some air, "cause I feel..."

507
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,680
Oh, shit.

508
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:47,431
Oh, shit.

509
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,429
Fuck.

510
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:16,456
Listen, whatever you do,
please just don't get involved.

511
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:19,133
I need to handle this my way.

512
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,677
I'm... I'm gonna go out
for a minute.

513
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:23,971
- Do you know where you're going?
- No, I don't.

514
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:27,596
I'm just gonna go take a walk
and probably get a coffee.

515
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,018
- Do you have money?
- I'm fine.

516
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,597
Okay, take some money, please.

517
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,100
All right, I'll see you soon.

518
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,443
Here, okay.

519
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,146
I changed my mind.

520
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,252
Mikey?

521
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,593
Mikey?

522
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:12,802
Mikey.

523
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,343
Mikey.

524
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,355
Mikey.

525
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:35,784
- Hey, Tom.
- Hey, Laura.

526
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,160
What's up?

527
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:39,083
Oh, you know, I just wondered

528
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,332
if Mikey's back
from New York yet?

529
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,459
- Not yet.
- Oh, okay.

530
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:48,669
'Cause I'm dying to play
some backgammon and...

531
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,254
Hey, look, I was just going
to the supermarket.

532
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,838
I was just wondering if, uh,

533
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,389
you need anything,
because I could...

534
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:57,138
Oh, that's so sweet of you, Tom.

535
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:58,229
How nice.

536
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,558
No, we're fine, no.

537
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:01,355
- Thank you.
- Are you sure?

538
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,897
- I'm sure.
- Oh, all right.

539
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,851
What about something
for the baby, you know,

540
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:06,606
some of that mashed stuff,
I don't know,

541
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,938
mashed carrots and bananas

542
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,490
or, I don't know,
broccoli, whatever.

543
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:12,908
Whatever they like.

544
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:15,157
No, we're okay.
Thank you though.

545
00:56:15,247 --> 00:56:17,614
Well, look, if, uh,
if you need anything,

546
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,824
don't be afraid to ask,
you know where I am,

547
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,408
just around the corner.

548
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,835
- Okay, I will.
- Okay, cool.

549
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,504
Um, okay.

550
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:27,173
- All right.
- Bye.

551
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:25,245
By him?

552
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,951
I don't know,
they don't mention...

553
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,206
I have a book here.

554
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:30,663
Conversations with, uh,

555
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:34,045
abstra... abstra...
Abstract expressionis...

556
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,718
Expressionists.

557
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:37,294
But I think it includes him.

558
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:39,471
Yeah, and it also says

559
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:43,552
this is gonna be, like,
the last of the abstract...

560
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,558
You know, they now...
They'll now have

561
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:51,358
the last work of...
Of the abstract expressionists,

562
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:54,938
in terms of what they consider
to be the first...

563
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:56,318
That's bull.

564
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:58,149
<i>There's people,
they-they never got,</i>

565
00:58:58,243 --> 00:58:59,733
like, Max, for instance.

566
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:02,035
No, but they mean
of that generation.

567
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:04,580
That generation is, you know,
there's hidden people

568
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,077
we don't know. «No.

569
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:08,626
And maybe
they don't know either.

570
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:11,921
And there... and now there's
these art conservators.

571
00:59:12,007 --> 00:59:14,499
-Who's building it?
+I don't really know who,

572
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:17,335
but there is gonna be
a museum in Denver.

573
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:21,343
You know, they can show from
the "20s, the '30s, the '40s."

574
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:23,674
- Yeah.
- They can show, you know...

575
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,265
That doesn't bother me.

576
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,891
- Think that's good.
- Yeah.

577
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:32,558
Yeah, yeah,

578
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,188
Well...
- He's been working.

579
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:35,735
I mean, he had been working

580
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,688
and he produced
an enormous amount.

581
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,899
He's not really up hiding it.

582
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,701
The museum will...
This museum will show,

583
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:44,779
but they're not gonna show
thousands of works.

584
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:46,614
No, they say, um...

585
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:49,666
He said we can clear the whole
museum and just do drawings.

586
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:52,336
He said, the challenging
question is whether people

587
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,289
will come for repeat visits
to see stills art.

588
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:01,173
Mikey, we're going to Chinatown.

589
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,216
You wanna join us?

590
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:04,759
Can't.

591
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,509
Shall we bring you back
something?

592
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,638
No, thanks, I'm gonna make
something here.

593
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,310
Okay.

594
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:15,307
We'll see you in a little while.

595
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,809
Bye.

596
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,482
Bye, Mike.

597
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,988
Yeah, I know, it's crazy.

598
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:42,156
I, um...

599
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:45,861
I just came here
for work, and...

600
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,947
I thought it would be
really nice to reconnect.

601
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:52,663
Okay.

602
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,876
S... so, 10 a.m. tomorrow.

603
01:08:58,718 --> 01:08:59,718
All right,

604
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,424
Can you hang on one second?

605
01:09:15,026 --> 01:09:17,393
Uh, Brigitte,
that's actually my other line.

606
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:21,276
Um, so, I'll see you then,

607
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:23,232
Okay, thanks.

608
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:24,326
Bye.

609
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:46,050
Um, it's Laura,

610
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,222
Hi, I was...

611
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:51,142
I was hoping to speak
to you both.

612
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:53,186
I'm not sure
what Mikey's been telling you,

613
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:56,355
but we've expected him home
a while ago now.

614
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:59,309
<i>I don't really understand
where he is or what he's doing.</i>

615
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:00,894
His phone's off,

616
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:03,571
<i>and it seems like
he won't speak to me,</i>

617
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:06,946
and I'm here faking care
of... of Ana and everything.

618
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,323
So please, I would appreciate
if you could, um,

619
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:13,078
give me some insight
to why he's not coming home.

620
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:15,078
So please call me back.

621
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:16,250
Thanks.

622
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:17,452
Bye.

623
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,549
Message deleted.

624
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,294
Looks very good.

625
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:28,671
Okay.

626
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:34,051
I'm just gonna go check
on the pie.

627
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:40,596
What's going on?

628
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,567
Laura started...
Started seeing someone...

629
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:47,815
Stop, stop.

630
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:55,570
Do you recall us
once lying to you?

631
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:19,684
Is everything okay?

632
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:22,558
Everything's very good.

633
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:24,855
Thank you very much,
It's beautiful.

634
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:27,475
Thank you.

635
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:28,981
It's fine.

636
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:21,524
Mikey?

637
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:24,786
Brigitte.

638
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:28,865
- Hi.
- Hi.

639
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:30,791
...“Wow, that's...

640
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:32,921
I can't believe it.

641
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,370
- I know.
- It's crazy.

642
01:16:34,465 --> 01:16:36,081
It's been a long time.

643
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:37,711
Yeah.

644
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:40,376
Hi.

645
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:46,432
Um, sit down, please.

646
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:50,060
I see you brought
your little baby.

647
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:51,854
Julie, that's little Julie.

648
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:53,852
Say hi.

649
01:16:55,569 --> 01:16:58,231
So, how... how long has it been?

650
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:01,523
It's been since...

651
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:07,321
...high school,
our sophomore year...

652
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:09,701
of high school.

653
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:11,703
Can I get you something?

654
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:13,660
Oh, no, no, I'm fine,
I have to...

655
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:15,370
Okay. Yeah.

656
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:19,624
So...

657
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:23,006
- Yeah.
- 80... what's... what's up?

658
01:17:24,932 --> 01:17:27,014
It's very weird.

659
01:17:27,101 --> 01:17:28,557
Um...

660
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:33,888
I found a... just a letter
that you wrote,

661
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:35,644
um, from high school.

662
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:38,476
I found it
in my parents' place, and...

663
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:45,491
I just-just wanted to...

664
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:47,694
say that I was sorry.

665
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:51,789
What?

666
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:53,492
For what?

667
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:00,214
For whatever happened back then,

668
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:04,089
Wow.

669
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:07,843
Well, um...

670
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:11,471
whatever you're sorry for,
apology accepted.

671
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:12,597
It's...

672
01:18:20,154 --> 01:18:21,815
Um...

673
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:24,568
Now that we have that
out of the way...

674
01:18:24,658 --> 01:18:26,865
So, what have...
What have you been up to

675
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:29,944
since you, um, you know,

676
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:33,282
were into fireworks
and skateboards?

677
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,616
- Got one of these?
- Oh, yeah.

678
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:38,373
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

679
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:39,545
And a wife.

680
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:41,543
Oh, really? Let me see.

681
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:50,556
That's Laura.

682
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:52,179
- She's pretty.
- Thanks.

683
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:54,852
- And Ana.
- Oh my God.

684
01:18:54,939 --> 01:18:57,021
Aw, what a darling.

685
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:27,210
Give me your other hand.

686
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:29,170
Okay.

687
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:31,891
All right,

688
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:35,885
I know.

689
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,766
Thank you so much, Tom.

690
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:40,063
It's my pleasure.

691
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:41,436
All right,

692
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:43,109
Hey, Laura, let me, uh,

693
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:45,277
let me... let me take
the baby inside.

694
01:19:45,364 --> 01:19:47,651
Come on...

695
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:51,325
I haven't had a baby in my hands
in a long time.

696
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:54,655
Uh, okay.

697
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:56,910
Just be really careful.

698
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,581
Hey, baby.

699
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:03,208
(

700
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:50,630
Hey.

701
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:53,129
Back here.

702
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:08,777
Hey.

703
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,572
Hey, man, what's up?

704
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:13,114
What's goin' on?

705
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:14,784
I fucked up last night, man.

706
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:18,704
I got a piss test tomorrow too.

707
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:20,532
What happened?

708
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:22,412
Oh, man, I got high last night,

709
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:24,460
but don't worry,
I went to the gym,

710
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:27,254
and I spent two hours
on the elliptical.

711
01:21:27,341 --> 01:21:30,083
I was working out like
a mad man, like a beast.

712
01:21:30,177 --> 01:21:32,544
I'm not goin' back, don't worry.

713
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:44,226
Get fuckin' shit
outta my system.

714
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:51,775
Sweatin' that shit
right outta my system, man.

715
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:11,749
What are you listening to?

716
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:13,130
Indigo Girls, man.

717
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,382
Every time I heard them
when I was locked up,

718
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:17,088
it made me feel like I was free.

719
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:20,971
There's more than one answer
to these questions.

720
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:24,179
Pointing me in a crooked line.

721
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:27,561
And the less I seek my source
for some definitive.

722
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:30,439
- Hey, listen to it, man.
- I don't need to hear it.

723
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:33,191
- Indigo Girls.
- Ah, yeah.

724
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:38,994
Closer I am to fine, yeah

725
01:22:39,079 --> 01:22:43,789
I went to see
the doctor of philosophy.

726
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:48,712
With a poster of Rasputin
and a beard down to his knee.

727
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:53,837
He never did marry
or see a B-grade movie.

728
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:56,089
He graded my performance.

729
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:58,091
He said he could see through me

730
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:01,891
I spent four years prostrate
to the higher mind.

731
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:05,766
Got my paper and I was free

732
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:08,188
<i>I went to the doctor</i>

733
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:10,733
<i>I went to the mountains</i>

734
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:13,106
<i>1 looked to the children</i>

735
01:23:13,197 --> 01:23:15,609
1 drank from the fountains.

736
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:19,442
There's more than one answer
to these questions.

737
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:22,824
Pointing me in a crooked line.

738
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:26,783
And the less I seek my source.

739
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:30,836
Closer ( am to fine.

740
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,630
Closer ( am to fine.

741
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:41,180
Closer I am to fine, yeah.

742
01:24:28,689 --> 01:24:30,350
Mikey.

743
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,851
Hi, Dad.

744
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:35,476
Mikey?

745
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:36,606
Hi, Ma.

746
01:24:36,697 --> 01:24:38,483
Come here, please.

747
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:40,190
Can it wait?

748
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:41,365
No.

749
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:47,614
All right, give me a minute.
I'm just gonna put my coat down.

750
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,231
Come here.

751
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:19,322
What?

752
01:25:19,406 --> 01:25:20,567
Yes.

753
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:23,816
Ma.

754
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:26,531
Ma.

755
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:32,283
Ma, I'm gonna crush you.

756
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:37,087
Ma.

757
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:41,258
Ma.

758
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:52,307
Ma...

759
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:30,855
Sorry, your mailbox is full,

760
01:29:30,949 --> 01:29:32,940
This number cannot fake
new messages

761
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:35,992
until you erase some
of your existing messages.

762
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:37,911
Twenty-two new messages...

763
01:29:39,082 --> 01:29:40,447
First new message.

764
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:42,829
Mikey, uh,
I'm trying to figure out

765
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:45,035
where you are,
I don't really under...

766
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:46,962
Next message.

767
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:48,959
Mike, I'm wondering
if you have gotten

768
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:52,213
any of my messages,
and if you have, why-

769
01:29:52,304 --> 01:29:53,920
Next message.

770
01:29:54,014 --> 01:29:56,130
Mikey, this is your wife,
Laura, remember?

771
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:58,261
Where are you?
Why won't you call me back?

772
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:00,558
And why won't you answer
my calls?

773
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:02,010
Next message.

774
01:30:02,105 --> 01:30:04,392
I'm trying to find you and...

775
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:06,519
figure out what's going on.

776
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:09,361
Call me back.

777
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:32,838
You have one new message.

778
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:36,171
Hey, it's me.

779
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:37,880
Um...

780
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:43,685
I am coming home,

781
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:47,060
and, um, and...

782
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:50,438
<i>know I've said that a lot.</i>

783
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:54,604
And...

784
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:58,237
I, uh...

785
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:04,156
And I'm, uh...

786
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:05,786
And I really do understand

787
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:08,244
if you don't even want
to look at me.

788
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:13,795
I hope that you do,
but if you don't...

789
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:17,719
Okay, well, I'll see you
in a little bit.

790
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:19,513
All right, bye.

791
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:38,542
Got something for you.

792
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:42,300
- Bye, Dad.
- See ya, Mikey.

793
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:50,350
- Remember that?
- Yes.

794
01:32:52,776 --> 01:32:54,266
I have something else.

795
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:55,566
This is for you.

796
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:57,894
She's gonna melt quick
with these.

797
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:03,367
What about that? «It's great.

798
01:33:07,165 --> 01:33:08,655
- Thanks.
- Yes.

799
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:11,242
Carry it carefully
all the way to, uh, Los Angeles.

800
01:33:11,336 --> 01:33:12,497
I will.

801
01:33:13,963 --> 01:33:15,294
All right,

802
01:33:17,675 --> 01:33:19,382
Bye.
- Bye.

803
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:07,983
I hate you for never met.

804
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:14,151
I love you so much.

805
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:21,917
You just won't get, get over it.

806
01:37:26,049 --> 01:37:29,337
Well, you lie first,
and it wasn't true.

807
01:37:33,639 --> 01:37:36,677
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck you

808
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:38,679
I hope you die too.

809
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:45,770
You were my first,
I'll be your last.

810
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:52,652
You'll never forget
our early past.

811
01:37:55,328 --> 01:37:59,367
You'll never forget,
never forget.

812
01:37:59,457 --> 01:38:01,448
All the lies and deceit.

813
01:38:03,878 --> 01:38:08,873
To your... to your grave
it will follow, whoa, whoa.

814
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:12,425
The smiles and shade.

815
01:38:12,512 --> 01:38:16,176
So fuck you, fuck you,
fuck you, fuck you.

816
01:38:16,265 --> 01:38:17,505
Sorry, Dad.

817
01:38:19,018 --> 01:38:20,884
No, I just found, uh...

818
01:38:20,978 --> 01:38:23,185
some old songs from high school.

819
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:26,605
Yeah, okay.
