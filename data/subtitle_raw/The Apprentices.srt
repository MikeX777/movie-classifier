1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,360
Valerie, open up!

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,560
Valerie, open up!

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,360
Have you finished?

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,040
Shut it!

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,240
Miss, you can remove the fuse
for the doorbell.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,800
Try them all, you'll find it.

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,640
Yeah?

8
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,480
I'm a friend of Benoit.
Isn't he in?

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,960
He's catching up on his sleep.

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,760
- Antoine?
- Hi.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,800
I've just got back
from the States.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,640
Look, Valerie's...
Can I crash here for a night or two?

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,600
Take the room at the end.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,680
Valerie, I'm writing to tell you
I've moved into Benoit's place.

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,760
He's never here but I'm sharing
with a certain Frederic,

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,320
who has an amazing capacity
for doing nothing.

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,200
Since you left me...

18
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,440
Since we separated

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,120
I've not written much.
My play is a bit stalled...

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,280
I'm writing lots.

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,040
My play is almost finished.

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,280
I thought we could have dinner...

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,480
TRAINEES

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,040
Valerie,

25
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,680
I'm writing to tell you I've been

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,320
living at Benoit's for 4 months.

27
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,360
He's in America

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,960
and I share with Frederic,

29
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,320
a nice young chap

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,520
who's good at cooking pasta.

31
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,400
I think I left a few floppy disks

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,480
with you.

33
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,160
Could I pop round for them
one evening?

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,360
I was wondering if...

35
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,840
Valerie, You haven't heard
from me for a year now.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,240
I'm at Benoit's place.

37
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,440
He's gone to America

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,680
and become a dickhead.

39
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,160
I'm sharing with Fred, a nice lad.

40
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,720
I'm not sure what it is he does,

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,000
but he's good at cooking pasta

42
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,400
and listening to my play,

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
now finished...

44
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,920
...now almost finished.

45
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,960
I was near your place
the other day

46
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,960
and I thought you'd be happy...

47
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,200
...pleased...

48
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,120
...that it might amuse you...

49
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,240
Valerie...

50
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,760
Valerie,

51
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,360
{\an5}You'll be surprised by this letter
after three years without news.

52
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,520
{\an5}I'm living
at dickhead Benoit's place.

53
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,360
He said he saw you in New York.

54
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,480
I'm glad to know you're travelling.

55
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,640
{\an5}I'm sharing with Fred,
an endearing young man.

56
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,120
{\an5}I started on my play again.
It's finished now.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
It's almost finished.

58
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,400
It's amazing the noise you make!

59
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,200
Can't you piss down the side?

60
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,520
I like pissing in the middle.

61
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,320
It gives me a feeling of power.

62
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,720
Self-affirmation!

63
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,280
Mercier complains about hearing
you affirm yourself in the night.

64
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,440
I can't help it.

65
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,920
If I don't do it in the middle
it's not like having a real piss.

66
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,280
No sense of relief.

67
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,280
Nothing else to eat?

68
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,720
No vegetables?
Stuff that grows in the earth?

69
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,000
Like lettuce or a tomato?

70
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,480
A tomato. Remember what that is?

71
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,400
These aren't bad
with water and sugar.

72
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,120
How long does familiarity last

73
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,080
with someone
you don't see any more?

74
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,080
Why do you ask me that?

75
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,840
I don't know whether to put

76
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,360
"Valerie"
or "My little Valerie".

77
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,800
"My dear Valerie"?

78
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,240
How long's it been?

79
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,400
Four and a half years.

80
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,760
Put "Valerie"...

81
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,760
or "Dear Madam".

82
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,440
- How much is the pencil?
- 17 francs 50.

83
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,200
17 francs 50?
It's not even been sharpened!

84
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,680
- How much is the pencil?
- 17 francs 50.

85
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,240
I'll take it.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,480
Antoine, it's Fred. I'm in FNAC.

87
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,000
I've got a problem.

88
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,520
Could you get down here quick
with the emergency funds.

89
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,120
All of it, because...

90
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,280
Yes, OK...

91
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,400
It's loose change
from buying bread, newspapers,

92
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,440
milk, cigarettes and...

93
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Go on...
Go on, they're really interested!

94
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,840
Hardly any left!
I'm sure they ripped us off.

95
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,400
Shut it!

96
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,280
What? What's wrong?

97
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,840
Stealing photographic paper?

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,040
The photographer whose ads
I stick up buys it off me.

99
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,320
Aren't you sick of this bollocks?

100
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,080
What's got into you?

101
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,960
I was ashamed in that office.
Ashamed!

102
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,760
Are you lecturing me?

103
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,480
No, I'm not lecturing you.

104
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,720
I looked like a twat
with my jars of copper coins.

105
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,120
It's pathetic!

106
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,240
You're not so conscientious
when I nick your Babybel cheese!

107
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,760
Pathetic!

108
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,840
Hey, you've got five of a kind!

109
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,360
Again!

110
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,280
Very good. You now.

111
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,920
I'm not asking you to shout,
but to express...

112
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,960
love!

113
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,560
Love, the need for another.

114
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,520
It's like gulping down

115
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
fresh air...

116
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,120
Vital air!

117
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
Are you sticking them up
for someone

118
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,200
or are you the photographer?

119
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,760
It's me.
I'm the photographer.

120
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,160
I need some photos doing.

121
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,400
That's lucky.

122
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,720
Maybe... I don't know.
I'd have to see your photos.

123
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,200
I've got a portfolio.

124
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,880
I'll give you a ring.

125
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,080
I'll give you my personal number.
That's the studio.

126
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,920
The dance aspect of acting,
you see.

127
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,840
Concentrate on that
in your article.

128
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,200
The director as choreographer.

129
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,560
Choreographer?

130
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,800
If you came to training
you'd understand.

131
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,920
I'm off now.

132
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,200
Yes. Right away, Mrs Kowarsky.

133
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,200
- Here.
- Thank you.

134
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,840
When will you be able to pay me?

135
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,800
As always, in five weeks.

136
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
- 700 francs isn't...
- If you need money,

137
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,160
I know someone who's looking
for a crossword-setter.

138
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,680
Two floors down.

139
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,320
- Just mention my name.
- Thanks.

140
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,120
But I've got some good news.

141
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,920
We've finally got
the paper's new key-rings!

142
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,240
Take your pick.

143
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,680
Could you lend me 1,000 francs?

144
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,360
It's Henri's birthday.

145
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,160
He collects exotic fish.

146
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,960
Sorry.
I'd like to help you out but...

147
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,200
I couldn't afford a goldfish.

148
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,560
It's OK.

149
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,000
Give him some seaweed.

150
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,080
- He collects fish?
- Yes. Does that surprise you?

151
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,160
- On the contrary.
- What do you mean?

152
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,000
A certain family likeness.

153
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,280
You always slag off
the men I'm with.

154
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,760
- He should eat them.
- Stop it!

155
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,640
Fish is brain food.

156
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,720
- You're jealous.
- No, I'm just being stupid.

157
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,120
Those drinks we had...

158
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,560
I never slagged off Valerie.

159
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,960
- Why? Did you want to?
- No. On the contrary.

160
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,920
After all, she took you from me.

161
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,480
If you hadn't met her
we'd still be together.

162
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,280
I'd still be starving, poor,
badly dressed, depressed,

163
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,840
and still wouldn't know
what an orgasm was!

164
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,840
Very funny!

165
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,160
It's weird,
drinking in the afternoon.

166
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,840
Why? It's nice, isn't it?

167
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,640
Like being on holiday.

168
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,040
How many times
have you read that paper?

169
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,240
How can you spend so much time

170
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,680
looking at the photo of an engine?

171
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,280
But look at it!
6 cylinders.

172
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,600
That many?

173
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,880
You wouldn't understand.

174
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,040
No.
Is 6 better than 4, then?

175
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,480
Yeah. More of them!

176
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,800
Such a...
Such a fascinating conversation!

177
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,200
There's a girl over there
at least twice as tall as me.

178
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,760
This is Sandra.

179
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Hello.

180
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,600
We're going out for dinner.

181
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,360
When did you get here?

182
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,960
This afternoon, from the States.
We were having a nap.

183
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,080
- Any messages?
- Just your mail, over there.

184
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,440
It's filthy in here.

185
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
You haven't nicked a white shirt?

186
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,040
We never go in your room.

187
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,280
Are you sure?

188
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,200
With mother-of-pearl buttons.

189
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,920
Stuff your mother-of-pearl buttons!

190
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,600
See you, then.

191
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,640
- What got into you?
- He pissed me off.

192
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,680
"Back from the States, any mail?

193
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,920
"Have you seen my shirt?"
Wanker!

194
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,600
He's always just getting back
from the States.

195
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,240
Has she got a full load, his bird?

196
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,800
Is she French, American?

197
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,960
No idea. She never spoke.

198
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,000
He must have given her instructions.

199
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,040
She wasn't that great.
Wasn't her left eye a bit funny?

200
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,480
Her arse is really flat.

201
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,920
No tits to talk of.

202
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,520
You can tell that
from the shoulders.

203
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,200
Especially with big girls.

204
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,480
Plenty of nasty surprises,
once you got her kit off.

205
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,880
The bastard!

206
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,080
Yeah?

207
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
It's me.
I forgot to tell you.

208
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,360
My gran wants to sell the flat.

209
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,480
You'll have to move out.
We'll talk when I get back.

210
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,000
Benoit Benoit!
Don't arse about!

211
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,280
Look...

212
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,600
It's not that big an emergency.

213
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,440
And we can find another one.

214
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,120
How will we pay for it?

215
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,080
You have to show pay slips.
Have you got any?

216
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,760
Most of the time
I'm paid cash in hand.

217
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,880
No social security, even!

218
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,080
She can't just kick us out.
There are laws against it.

219
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,600
We can go
to the industrial tribunal.

220
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,400
Industrial tribunal!

221
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,280
The industrial tribunal
is for when you've got a job.

222
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,520
Yeah?

223
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,040
It's Nicolas.
I've come for a shower.

224
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,680
I don't know. We could sue her.

225
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,360
We're not even paying rent.

226
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,080
His gran's been lending us the flat
for free for the last five years.

227
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,840
How could we sue her?

228
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,000
How can you be so stupid?

229
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,920
Do you go to evening classes?

230
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,600
I'm trying to find a solution.
I'm thinking.

231
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,760
Just count your cylinders.
You're better at that!

232
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,080
Where are you going?

233
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,480
You're pissing me off!

234
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,880
Sod off, then!

235
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,880
Am I in the way?

236
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,840
Not unless you use
all the hot water.

237
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,200
I brought you
some in-flight meals.

238
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,480
You remind me more and more
of my parents.

239
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,320
You haven't consummated
your relationship, have you?

240
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,040
One, two, three.

241
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,000
Hello, it's Frederic's mum.

242
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,480
Hello.

243
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,720
- Did I wake you up?
- No, I was working.

244
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,880
Fred!

245
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,480
Your mum.

246
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,600
- Yes?
- Are you coming to see us?

247
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,880
I don't feel like it.

248
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,320
I'll make you
a lovely rabbit in mustard.

249
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,400
And I've made you some pickles.

250
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,520
All right!

251
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,560
Come for lunch on Sunday.
We've lots to talk about.

252
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,600
I won't ask you for the money.

253
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
What this about money?

254
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,200
I'm going to bed.

255
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,760
We're supposed to share our money.

256
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,840
I paid the bills
the last three times.

257
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,720
- I supply our food.
- You nick it!

258
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,520
- So?
- So...

259
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,400
We only eat what you can fit
in your pockets.

260
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,680
Cheese, hamburgers,
tins of sardines,

261
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,240
fish fingers...
All stuff in square boxes!

262
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,400
I want to eat real food.
Do you understand?

263
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,120
A lettuce, for example.
Nick a lettuce next time.

264
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,080
Understand?

265
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,800
I'm warning you.
You'd better find some money.

266
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,280
Can I buy you a drink?

267
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,720
Hello.

268
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,040
They're lovely.
How long have you been doing this?

269
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,160
A year and a half.

270
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,800
Shall we do it right now?

271
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,040
Have you got your camera?

272
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,360
Is my make-up all right?
And the light?

273
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,920
Yeah... Well, I don't know...

274
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,560
Shall we?

275
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,840
Right here.

276
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,560
Right... Sit down there.

277
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,360
Look at all these damn buttons!

278
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,520
It went off all by itself!

279
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,320
Sometimes it does that,
it just goes off by itself.

280
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,800
- Is it much further?
- No. Just there, on the right.

281
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,560
What are your shirt buttons made of?

282
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,480
Sorry it's dark.
But the light damages my eyes.

283
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,040
Have a biscuit.

284
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,040
Thank you, madam.

285
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,400
So?

286
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,280
You've come about the flat?

287
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,840
Yes. Benoit must have told you.

288
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,920
- Benoit
- Your grandson, Benoit.

289
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,800
You want to buy the flat?

290
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,440
No, not at all.

291
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,640
You see, we're students...

292
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,640
We'd just like a bit more time,
so we can sort ourselves out...

293
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,760
I say...

294
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,400
Could you try and find my glasses?

295
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,720
They're big, wrap-around ones,

296
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,960
to protect my eyes.

297
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,880
Of course, madam.

298
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,760
Did you hurt yourself?

299
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,800
No, not at all.

300
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,880
So you're students?

301
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Yes.

302
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,160
Yes.

303
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,560
What are you studying?

304
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm a 7th-year medical student

305
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,560
and Fred's doing advanced maths.

306
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,800
Pure, applied...

307
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,160
I'm still hesitating
about which way to go.

308
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,480
Pure, applied...

309
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,200
- I've found your glasses.
- Are you sure?

310
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,560
I think Mrs Picard stole them.

311
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,280
She realised I suspected her

312
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,640
and brought them back
in the night.

313
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,600
She gives me injections
while I'm asleep.

314
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,520
She used to be a nurse.

315
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,800
No, I don't think
there's anything to worry about.

316
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,920
What do you know?
You don't live here!

317
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,920
It's true, you don't.

318
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,040
You're right.
Do you want me to check the lock?

319
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,760
Yes, have a look.

320
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,160
Anyway... about the flat?

321
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
What flat?

322
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,440
The flat.

323
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,720
You'll have to go.

324
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,400
I want to settle my affairs
while I'm still compos mentis.

325
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,240
I bought it
off Mr Roland Hulot of the bar,

326
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,000
in 1937. On 9th May.

327
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,400
Now it's worth a lot more.
Billions!

328
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,680
No, you'll have to go.

329
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,960
I want to sell. I have to sell!

330
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,240
I have to sell... Yes.

331
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,440
If I may...
The market's not good at the moment.

332
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,720
I'd advise you to wait.

333
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,520
It'll go up again.
I'm saying this for your sake.

334
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
It'll go up.

335
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,600
- Are you the one doing medicine?
- No. Antoine.

336
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,200
Me.

337
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,800
I wonder...

338
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,920
Could you look at my tongue?

339
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,200
Fred!

340
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,240
- What is it?
- I'm very worried.

341
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,960
What if we have to leave the flat?

342
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,360
- We'll talk about it tomorrow.
- No, now! If you don't mind.

343
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,480
I've come to a decision.

344
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,520
All this has got to end.
I'm going to get a proper job.

345
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,840
Getting started was OK at first,

346
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,240
but I've been getting started
for ten years.

347
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,160
I want a calm life.

348
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,400
Money. A telly.

349
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,240
Some creature comforts.

350
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,040
We don't have to leave right away.

351
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,600
She has to find a buyer first.

352
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,320
And the price will go up.
We're fine.

353
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,320
We're fine, I tell you.
Don't worry.

354
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,520
I don't know what it is.
I don't usually worry at this hour.

355
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,760
Is that the right time?

356
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,360
Shit, it's back again!

357
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,360
- What?
- My heart thing.

358
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,160
It starts beating weirdly.

359
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,800
Listen.

360
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,000
Do you hear it?

361
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,200
- Two beats instead of one.
- I don't know...

362
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,960
Put your head there.

363
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,640
Well?

364
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,240
It's nothing.
It's just your nerves.

365
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,240
I know it's my nerves.
That doesn't mean it's nothing.

366
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,880
This isn't a healthy life
we lead, Fred.

367
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,480
We eat junk.

368
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,680
We don't live properly.
We drink too much.

369
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,280
We need to get a grip.

370
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,400
Sylvie told me about her sex life,

371
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,240
and I realised that we're sexless.

372
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,760
A sex life is important, isn't it?

373
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,880
Yes.

374
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,440
What did Sylvie tell you?

375
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,520
- Can we talk about something else?
- Why?

376
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,320
It's good to talk about sex.

377
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,360
With sex, half of the pleasure
is doing it,

378
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,720
the other half is talking about it.

379
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,440
Maybe we should get
some of the other half.

380
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,240
Why don't you get back with her?

381
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,600
- She scares me.
- Why?

382
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,320
She's too much of an expert.

383
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,200
Like shagging a winner
of the Nobel Sex Prize!

384
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,200
Don't worry about that.
Just slip her your big schlong!

385
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,640
That'll sort her out.

386
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,480
All I want is to live with Valerie
in a nice, three-room flat,

387
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,600
and get 45,000 francs
in royalties a month.

388
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,440
You're being silly now.

389
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,440
Have I told you
about our first night together?

390
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,320
Have mercy!

391
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,000
And the time we made love
with her 14-year-old cousin?

392
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,280
I've never told you?

393
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,240
No, I'd definitely remember that.

394
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,600
It was during the winter break.

395
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,720
We were at her aunt's.

396
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,720
We were shagging all the time
back then.

397
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,440
The problem was that her cousin,
who was very beautiful,

398
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,000
always wanted to know
what we were up to.

399
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,960
One evening, we left her
watching some crap on telly...

400
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,120
some kids thing...

401
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,320
And she came up to our room.

402
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,600
We were on the bed, naked,
and we heard her coming upstairs.

403
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,640
The exciting thing was,
we knew she'd try to come in.

404
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,720
It made it all...
I don't know how to explain.

405
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,360
- You know...
- Yes, yes. Carry on.

406
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,680
The door opened.

407
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,880
She saw us

408
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,480
and, rather than screaming
or being embarrassed... nothing.

409
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,080
Nothing.

410
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,680
- She started taking her jumper off.
- You're having me on!

411
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,440
Slowly,
as if it was perfectly normal.

412
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,880
Valerie took her hand,
pulled her onto the bed

413
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,760
and started stroking her hair.

414
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,200
I was shaking!
You can imagine.

415
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,600
And then her little cousin
bent over me...

416
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,000
You're having me on?

417
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,320
Yeah.

418
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,440
You bastard!

419
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,560
Piss off, you bastard!

420
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,200
You little pervert.
You were enjoying that, eh?

421
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,600
Did you have a bit of a stiffy?

422
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,880
What do you think?
I'm a man!

423
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,960
Piss off now!
I want to go to sleep.

424
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,720
- Do you want to be alone?
- Sod off!

425
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,960
Well... the former tenants
seem to have left a few things,

426
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,360
but you can still get
a good idea of the layout.

427
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,720
You have a hallway,
with two windows onto the courtyard.

428
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,000
A huge lounge
leading on to one bedroom,

429
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,920
which you can also reach
from the corridor...

430
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,120
Back into the hallway,
and the second bedroom,

431
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,840
which is much bigger
and gets lots of light.

432
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,280
I'm showing people round.
Didn't anyone tell you?

433
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,720
Sorry, I...
I don't usually sleep here.

434
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,880
We had a few too many to drink
last night.

435
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,640
I'll be right with you.

436
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,760
Sorry.

437
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,840
Cockroaches everywhere!

438
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,680
You put me
in an embarrassing situation.

439
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,160
You shouldn't be here.
If you'd cleaned, at least!

440
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,680
How hard is it to use a sponge?

441
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
Like that!

442
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,160
The bottles...
We'll put them over here.

443
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,680
Give the tea-towels
a bit of a shake.

444
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,920
If you wash up regularly
you don't get nasty smells.

445
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,760
And the windows are disgusting.

446
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,000
If you don't have
any cleaning products

447
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,000
use an old newspaper.
It works very well.

448
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,200
There!

449
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,280
It takes no time.

450
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,000
Clean windows
make all the difference.

451
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,600
I have a brother who lives like you,
so I understand.

452
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,480
Your mind's on other things.

453
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,280
People are strange.

454
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,880
If they walk

455
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,360
into a dirty flat,
they think it's always been dirty

456
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,800
and always will be.

457
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
Excuse me.

458
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,280
Thanks.

459
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,640
People are strange like that.

460
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,840
Where do you put
your dirty clothes?

461
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,960
We wear them.

462
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,400
- Have you got a big bed?
- What?

463
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,440
A big bed or a little bed?

464
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,720
A big one.

465
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,880
But what size?
140cm by 190cm or 160cm by 190cm?

466
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,280
I've no idea. Why?

467
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,240
I wondered if you could put me up
for a few days.

468
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,720
Of course.

469
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,520
We're getting kicked out.

470
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,520
Come when you like.

471
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,320
- Have you got a sofa, too?
- Yes.

472
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,840
- When can we come?
- Who's "we"?

473
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,640
Frederic and me.

474
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,640
What's so funny?

475
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,600
You're like hitch-hikers.

476
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,560
The car stops
then all your pals appear.

477
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,280
You know
I don't get on with Frederic.

478
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,320
OK, I'm sorry...
I shouldn't have asked.

479
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,120
Look, she hasn't even seen us.
She's depressed since dad died.

480
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,480
Hello, mum.

481
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,000
Darling! Hello.

482
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,880
- Hello, Antoine.
- Hello.

483
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,560
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

484
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,520
- You don't look well.
- I am. Why do you say that?

485
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,520
Just a hunch.

486
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,080
I see so many depressives
that I know the signs.

487
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,560
Ask for an appointment.

488
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,480
Antoine, it's very nice here.

489
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,760
Antoine!

490
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,880
There.

491
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,120
Perfect. Stop!

492
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,240
Stop! Shit!

493
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,440
Marc, please.
Just a couple of seconds.

494
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,080
Could you explain
about the exposure time again?

495
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,640
You're a pain, Fred.
This is the last time.

496
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,040
You never understand anything.
It's not as if it's complicated!

497
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,480
And my portfolio?

498
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,320
When am I going to get it back?

499
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,440
- No problem.
- And my 500 francs?

500
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,280
They're gloomy.

501
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,600
That's what makes them stylish.

502
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,320
Maybe, but you can hardly see me.

503
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,360
- I look ugly.
- No, you don't.

504
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,640
Employers will be surprised
when they see you,

505
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,680
rather than being disappointed,
which is what usually happens.

506
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,760
That's obviously you.

507
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,360
No, I'm sorry.
I don't want them.

508
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,840
I'm not blowing 500 francs
on photos I can't even use.

509
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,640
Hang on.

510
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,000
- What are you doing?
- A second opinion.

511
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,920
- Excuse me!
- Stop it!

512
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,520
- Please...
- Stop it! Don't!

513
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,920
Don't worry.

514
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,240
Could you give me your opinion
about these photos?

515
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,640
Tell the truth, don't hold back.

516
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,120
You'll see.

517
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,640
They're not bad...

518
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,720
This one lacks contrast.
Some of them are overexposed...

519
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,480
This is too grainy.
They're too direct for portraits,

520
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,320
and with sensitive film
you should have...

521
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,840
- I'll have another coffee.
- Coming right up.

522
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,960
Wanker!

523
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,880
Hang on.

524
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,240
- You can have them.
- Thanks.

525
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,440
They could always come in handy.

526
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,560
Look, couldn't we have another try?

527
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,440
I'll do them the way you want.
I won't be so...

528
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,320
radical!
- OK. I have to go now.

529
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,320
- How about Wednesday?
- Perfect.

530
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,040
OK.

531
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,960
Get a good eyeful, did you?

532
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,960
"The beginning of all our woes",
5 letters... "Birth".

533
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,360
"After a long, hard life",
5 letters.

534
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,040
"Death".

535
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,200
"It keeps you out of heaven,
but releases you from hell",

536
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,320
seven letters.

537
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,480
"Suicide".

538
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,760
And it goes on... "Solitude",
"impossibility", "resignation..."

539
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,480
And there are far worse.

540
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,720
I thought it was quite original.

541
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,920
What can I say?

542
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,640
"Out of the door", 5 letters.

543
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,240
"Fired"?

544
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,840
How often did you do this last year?

545
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,160
Just watch.
I'm going to amaze you!

546
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,720
- Tap them both...
- Go on.

547
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,880
Let me wipe away the snow.

548
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,600
Hey, my ski-pass!

549
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,960
Are you ready?
Shall I give you a push?

550
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,040
No, don't push me!

551
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:14,680
Ready!
Five, four, three, two, one!

552
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,800
Are you all right?

553
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,160
I dug the edges in...

554
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,840
You know what I'd like right now?

555
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,760
To be in a car crash.

556
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,440
Not a big one. Just a broken leg
and a couple of cracked ribs.

557
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,520
Lying in a hospital bed

558
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,080
and waiting for my body to heal,

559
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,200
for my bones to knit back together,

560
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,040
like so many little miracles
happening inside my body.

561
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,680
The bones knit back together!

562
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,920
The ribs move back into position!

563
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,080
My eye goes down.

564
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,840
My lip scars over.

565
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,080
I watch myself heal,
I feel myself getting better.

566
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,880
Then there's physiotherapy.

567
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,800
You know what you're fighting for,
why it's such hard work.

568
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,360
Why?

569
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,920
So you can walk again.
It's simple!

570
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,320
Then, one day, you walk again,
and it's sublime.

571
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,800
You even dance,
and better than before.

572
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
One leg's shorter than the other.

573
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,800
You meet a girl who likes dancing.

574
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,840
You dance with her
and you shag her, for fuck sake!

575
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,520
So easy. Life is easy.
It's marvellous.

576
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,800
- Is it big?
- Fairly.

577
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,840
The rent was fixed in 1948!

578
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,600
- What floor?
- The fifth.

579
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,480
And no lift.

580
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,080
Don't complain.
At 1,800 F a month...

581
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,880
Don't forget to buy fags
on your way home!

582
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,800
- Are they nice?
- They're friends of my sister's.

583
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,120
Hi, Nico. How are you?

584
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,120
Come on in.

585
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,320
Hello.

586
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,600
Come on in.

587
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,200
- So, Claire...
- Sorry about the mess.

588
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,960
Want something to drink?
Beer, wine?

589
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,920
I'll put Jeanne to bed.
Want to see her room?

590
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,080
Yes, I'd like to.

591
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,160
- And the theatre?
- Sold out.

592
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,880
Can't get seats for your parents
for two weeks.

593
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,240
As long as they get
to see your play.

594
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,360
- Do you think they'll like it?
- I'm sure they will.

595
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,200
But it's a bit low-brow.

596
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,840
Write something else.
You're a good writer.

597
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,360
Knowing how to write doesn't mean
you've got anything to say!

598
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,640
If I wrote anything else
I'd be an impostor.

599
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm not an author, I'm a craftsman.

600
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,000
Subject, verb, object, joke!

601
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,960
I made leek and potato soup
for tonight.

602
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,600
I love you.

603
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,960
Well, then...

604
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,960
It's perfect.
The paint is in good condition.

605
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,360
No redecorating to be done.

606
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,360
I think we'll take it.

607
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,000
We'd like the hand-over fee
in cash, if that's possible.

608
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,640
- The what?
- The hand-over fee.

609
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,320
We'd prefer the 25,000 francs
in cash.

610
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,880
I didn't know.

611
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,720
Didn't you tell Nicolas?

612
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,200
I thought you'd told him.

613
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,760
No.

614
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,800
25,000 francs?

615
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,840
We can't do it for less.

616
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,760
I thought it was a flat for paupers.

617
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,360
Paupers who've saved up
a lot of money!

618
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,520
Well...

619
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,200
OK, we'll take it.

620
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,040
On three, OK?

621
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,040
One, two, three!

622
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,960
- What are you doing?
- We need to be sure.

623
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,360
Is it on three, or after three?

624
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,440
Just let me do it.

625
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,160
- Please don't make a noise!
- I'm doing my best!

626
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,160
- But it's bound to make a noise!
- You're right.

627
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,840
Take your time.

628
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,640
It was your idea,

629
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,960
we can't stop now.

630
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,760
Why not?
No one's forcing us.

631
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,120
Come back!

632
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,280
Come back or I'll scream!

633
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,600
- Where's Karate Magazine?
- That way. Watch for an alarm.

634
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,120
- It'd have gone off already.
- A direct line to the cops?

635
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,160
This isn't the Bank of France!
We'll never get there at this rate.

636
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,520
- Warn me when you stop!
- I heard something.

637
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,920
Let's go.
Have you got gloves?

638
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,920
- I brought mittens.
- Mittens?

639
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,760
They're all I could find!

640
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,480
Quietly.

641
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,080
Fuck!
If Agnes could see me now.

642
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,080
It's crazy.
I can't stop thinking about her.

643
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,360
I think I'm in love.

644
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,440
- She's...
- What?

645
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,200
She's so pure.
There's a sort of aura about her.

646
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,200
She's so gentle, so kind...

647
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,760
- Who?
- Agnes! The photo girl.

648
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,360
- Stop it!
- What?

649
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,120
Concentrate on what you're doing!

650
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,000
When she looks at you,
it's so gentle...

651
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,360
You know she could never do
anything nasty or perverse.

652
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,280
Stop it or I'm leaving,
I'm warning you!

653
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,680
I can't help it
if she's on my mind.

654
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,680
I'm besotted.
You should understand that.

655
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,960
You and your one great love
of ten years ago,

656
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,520
your stupid fantasies,
your posh flat,

657
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,000
and your kids
that you take to the square

658
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,080
to play football.
Listen to me for once!

659
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,800
- Not so loud.
- Oh, piss off!

660
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,520
We're committing a burglary
right now.

661
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,560
A burglary!
You have to dress it up!

662
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,560
- Stop arsing about!
- All right.

663
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,960
If we get caught,
I'm the one they'll go hard on.

664
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,200
- Because I'm older.
- Here it is.

665
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,440
Too big. It won't fit.

666
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,000
Let's go, then.

667
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,520
No, hang on.

668
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,880
Quietly!

669
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,800
- Stop moving.
- What?

670
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,160
I said, stop moving!

671
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,560
Give me that.

672
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,440
There, try it.

673
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,800
Go on, get it in.

674
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,320
What's wrong?

675
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,360
It scared me to death.

676
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,720
Do something!

677
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,760
Like what?
Shove a Bic up its arse?

678
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,160
Here, pussy...

679
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,600
What's your name?

680
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,160
- Give me the crowbar.
- No! No violence.

681
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,800
I just want to scare it off.

682
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,560
Leave it to me.

683
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,440
All right?

684
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,760
You did it, Antoine!
You got it open!

685
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,360
Good God, we're in!

686
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,600
Only 50-franc notes.

687
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,040
This isn't Le Figaro, you know.

688
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,960
Great! 500s!

689
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,080
Don't stop now,
you've hit a seam!

690
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,520
Hang on.

691
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,680
Look.

692
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,280
- Antoine, that's enough.
- Hang on.

693
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,400
We've got to go.
It's getting light.

694
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,280
We'll get caught.

695
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,400
I'm going, Antoine.

696
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,880
- Stop!
- Look!

697
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,800
OK...

698
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,360
Stop arsing about now.

699
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:45,120
We'll get caught.
It's getting light.

700
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,880
Come on, let's go.

701
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,120
What's the matter with you?

702
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,080
Come on!

703
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,840
Come on!

704
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,960
I'm warning you!
I'm going now.

705
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,240
What are you doing?

706
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,640
Put these in your bag.

707
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,320
- What are they?
- Stamps.

708
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,800
You twat!

709
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,360
It's little things like that
that get you caught.

710
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,560
Well, you never write, do you?

711
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,680
Fred, wake up.

712
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,080
Let me sleep.

713
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,280
- I feel awful, Fred.
- Take a pill.

714
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:24,040
Let me sleep.
I was just having a nice dream.

715
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,720
You shouldn't go waking people up
like that.

716
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,400
- We did a bad thing.
- Yeah, right. Go to sleep.

717
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,080
We'll give the money back.

718
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,040
I'll take it before
they get to the office.

719
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,280
- Are you sick or what?
- Yes, I've been sick!

720
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,200
I feel disgusted with myself.

721
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,880
You'll get over it.
Go back to sleep.

722
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:53,640
Know how many small businesses
have gone bankrupt this year?

723
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,240
That's one of them.

724
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,600
Shut up.
I don't want to hear it.

725
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,640
They employ seven people.
Seven!

726
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,560
Not to mention the freelancers.
People like me

727
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,600
and Mrs Kowarsky.

728
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,520
Who?

729
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,200
The cleaning lady.
She's got two kids.

730
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,800
She's paid cash in hand.
That's what that money's used for.

731
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,400
Calm down.
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

732
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,280
It'll be Monday then.

733
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,720
It was your idea
to go and burgle the place!

734
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,320
So stop it!

735
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,840
Go to bed.

736
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,040
Go on, off to bed.

737
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,840
Off to bed.

738
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,240
Look straight ahead.
Don't move, Agnes.

739
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,720
Fred... Excuse me.
Can I have a word?

740
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,840
I'll be right back.

741
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,120
- Where did you get that camera?
- I bought it.

742
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,640
We were supposed to wait a while
before spending the money!

743
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,000
It's an investment, nothing at all.
What do you want?

744
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,800
The editor wants me
to go and see him.

745
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,920
I got the feeling
he suspects something.

746
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,120
- I don't want to go.
- Don't be stupid!

747
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,600
Not going
would be like a confession.

748
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,840
Act as if everything's normal.

749
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,640
I told you
we should have taken it back!

750
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,280
Don't start that again.
And stop whispering.

751
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,440
You speak like that
all the time now.

752
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,560
Can you come with me, please?

753
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,920
- I can't.
- Why?

754
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,400
- Because I can't.
- Yes but why?

755
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,880
- I've got something to do.
- What?

756
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:58,160
Agnes... I have to tell her
I love her. Now.

757
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,240
It's now or never, understand?
I've got to go.

758
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,040
Sorry but I've got to go now.

759
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:08,800
Fred, will you be in later?
I can't find my keys.

760
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,080
When will the photos be ready?

761
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,640
I don't know. Monday.

762
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,360
- Agnes?
- Yes. What is it?

763
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,280
I just wanted...

764
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,920
It's not easy to say but...

765
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,360
You move me.

766
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,080
That doesn't sound very nice.
How can I put it?

767
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,800
You get to me.

768
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,120
When I'm with you,

769
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,120
I feel sad and happy
at the same time.

770
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,320
And a bit ashamed, too.

771
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,240
Like I'm not worthy,

772
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,680
and you're someone
beyond my reach.

773
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,720
Even, sometimes,
when I'm next to you, I think...

774
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,040
I think I ought to go
and have a bath.

775
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,480
There.

776
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,160
Oh, yes, also...
As soon as you've gone, I miss you.

777
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,800
Even when you're with me but
looking somewhere else, I miss you.

778
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,080
Don't look at me like that.
It wasn't an insult.

779
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,240
It was a declaration.

780
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,520
I've nothing to be ashamed of.

781
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,840
Yes but I've already got someone.

782
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,400
His name's Patrick.
He's a stage manager.

783
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:56,880
Right...

784
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,680
That's good.
No, I mean...

785
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,680
He must get to see lots of plays.

786
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,680
He doesn't really get time.
Too busy.

787
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,120
Yeah, of course.

788
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,680
It doesn't change
how I feel about you.

789
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,240
And at least I've told you now.

790
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:20,920
I can't cheat on him.

791
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,920
No, I know you're not like that.

792
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,680
Or he could watch.

793
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,160
- Sorry?
- He could watch.

794
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,800
Watch what?

795
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,280
Us. We screw and he watches.
We enjoy that now and then.

796
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,400
What a mess!

797
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,240
I've got to go, I'm late.

798
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,440
Call us if you're into it.
Or call me, rather.

799
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,040
Excuse me.

800
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,240
I called you
because we've got a problem.

801
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,360
We were burgled
and all the cash was taken.

802
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,560
Shit!

803
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,480
We can't pay you

804
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:46,040
this month, and we'll be giving you
less work for a while.

805
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,160
- That's OK.
- Really?

806
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,840
I mean, I could do you
a few articles

807
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,960
for nothing.
All hands to the wheel!

808
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,440
- You can count on me.
- Don't bother.

809
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,240
And your article
about Van Damme...

810
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,160
Pierre would prefer an interview.

811
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,480
So I'm going to ask Caroline
to do it.

812
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,800
Good idea.

813
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,760
- If that's all...
- No problem.

814
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,360
The cleaning lady found them.

815
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,640
Right next to the safe.

816
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,560
It's almost funny.

817
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,120
I don't understand.
We've always been fair with you.

818
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,320
I helped you out.
Why spoil it all?

819
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,920
- I needed money.
- Everyone needs money.

820
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,080
We didn't call the police.
Relieved?

821
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,520
We'll settle this ourselves.

822
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,880
Right...

823
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:57,000
Found your keys, then.

824
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,760
Get the money and the camera.

825
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,600
They don't want it back.

826
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,840
It's OK, I'll manage.

827
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,320
All right?

828
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,440
It's only superficial.

829
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,920
I don't think you've got
any serious injuries.

830
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,920
They're pros.
They know what they're doing.

831
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,960
I've thought of something.

832
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,520
I think it could have been
the perfect job.

833
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:46,200
- Please, be quiet.
- Just let me tell you...

834
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,520
It won't take long.
The thing is...

835
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,640
It was perfect
because it was dirty money.

836
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,920
It didn't even exist, it was used
to pay people cash in hand.

837
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:00,880
What they were doing was illegal,
so they couldn't do anything to us.

838
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,120
Do you understand?

839
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,840
You should have just denied it.

840
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:14,680
84 francs 90, please.

841
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:21,080
We'll just take the cream
for the eyes.

842
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,160
I'll give you some bandages
and disinfectant

843
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,280
that are past their sell-by dates.

844
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,360
We've always got some left over.

845
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,160
Got your keys?
This doesn't work.

846
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,760
What's happened?

847
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,880
We've been kicked out.

848
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,120
The bastards
went to town on you, eh?

849
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,400
Come in.

850
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,160
You should go to the police.
They're not allowed to beat you up.

851
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,600
Go on.

852
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,040
Hello Taxi! Go ahead, please.

853
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,520
Yes, what address?

854
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,880
20B, Hippolyte-Maindron.

855
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,600
Yes, hold the line.
Your code!

856
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,360
Hold the line.

857
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,840
Yes, what address, please?

858
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,120
I'm sticking it out.

859
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:46,560
Two more months, then I'll ask
for management training.

860
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,320
- Do you like it?
- That's beside the point.

861
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,160
- But you liked writing.
- No. I liked waiting

862
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,920
for something to happen.
Writing's morbid.

863
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,960
You watch the time go by,
thick and sluggish...

864
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:08,800
I'm healthier now.
I see people, eat regular meals.

865
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,280
Look.
Nearly all my dandruff has gone!

866
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,760
You look tired.

867
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,520
At least I get you out
from time to time.

868
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,040
You're right.
A bit of greenery does you good.

869
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,920
It was mum who chose
this horrific thing.

870
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,840
I've planted thyme,
rosemary and tarragon.

871
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,400
I've got pay slips now.
I'll be able to get a flat.

872
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,920
But I'm not sleeping well.

873
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:50,320
The flat vibrates.
It's right next to a metro line,

874
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,480
I think.

875
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,680
I've got something here...

876
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:03,240
What's wrong? Stop it!

877
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,000
Stop it. Are you all right?

878
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,880
Come here.

879
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,800
Lots of people work.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

880
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,160
All I said was
I like what you write.

881
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,160
You've never read anything else!
You're ignorant!

882
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:25,080
You're not interested in anything.
What's going on around you?

883
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,400
What's going on in Africa
or the Middle East?

884
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:32,800
Just because he's been reading
Le Monde for the last three days!

885
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,960
What was that?
What did you say?

886
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,720
Nothing.

887
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,760
- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.

888
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,360
Don't lie, I heard you!

889
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,320
What did you say?

890
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,200
Agnes? It's Fred.
I didn't wake you, did I?

891
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:17,360
Anyway... Remember what you said
last time I saw you?

892
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,480
With your boyfriend.

893
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,440
Let's give it a go.

894
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,840
Wednesday's fine.

895
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,720
OK. Goodnight.

896
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:53,280
I recently moved in with a friend,

897
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,480
and that's when
the symptoms started.

898
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,360
He lives next to the metro,

899
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,280
and the vibrations
shake the whole flat.

900
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,440
How can I explain it?

901
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,920
- Can I borrow that pen?
- Be my guest.

902
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,600
Here's my ear.

903
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,920
The little bones of the inner ear
are here... Right?

904
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,000
Exactly.

905
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,120
And these little bones
keep my body upright and balanced?

906
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,240
I think that the vibrations
of the metro,

907
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,720
which I'm very sensitive to,

908
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,880
are disturbing the workings
of my inner ear,

909
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,320
hence the dizziness and nausea.

910
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:29,480
That's it.

911
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,760
Have you ever had
these sorts of symptoms before?

912
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,880
Before living there?

913
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,600
No, never.
Why, is it serious?

914
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,720
No, it's just fatigue.

915
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,240
I'll prescribe something
for the nausea and a tonic.

916
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,520
Apart from that?

917
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,320
- What?
- There's nothing else?

918
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,640
No family or work problems?

919
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,720
No more than anyone else.

920
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:04,640
I'll give you a colleague's name,
in case.

921
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,560
Could you write it there...

922
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,920
Hi.

923
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,960
- I'm Fred.
- Patrick. Come in.

924
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,120
Isn't Agnes here?

925
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,720
No.
She went out to buy some fags.

926
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,480
She won't be long.

927
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,920
So you work in the theatre?

928
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,360
It must be interesting.

929
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,440
I mean, you must get
to see all sorts of stuff.

930
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,600
It depends.

931
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,680
And you're a photographer?

932
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,040
Just getting started.
The thing I like about it

933
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,760
is that it's immediate,
it's there!

934
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,120
- I like it.
- Should have brought your camera.

935
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,280
- I didn't think.
- Stupid.

936
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,360
Sorry.

937
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,000
Look what I found on the stairs.

938
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,200
- All right?
- Fine.

939
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,720
Going to pour me a drink?

940
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,080
Can I roll one for myself?

941
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,760
No, take this one,
I'll roll another.

942
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,440
Thanks.

943
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,840
Agnes, take your top off.

944
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,800
Not yet.

945
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,960
Go on!

946
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,880
I don't bloody want to!

947
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:28,160
Come on.

948
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,840
Don't talk, it's distracting.

949
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:31,640
- Just one word.
- Last time,

950
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,320
it spoiled it for me.
- Always the same!

951
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:39,520
You can talk to me before,
but not during.

952
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,160
You only think about yourself.

953
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,640
And now you're going to sulk.

954
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,000
I'm not sulking.

955
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,240
- You are, you're sulking.
- I'm not.

956
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,480
I'm annoyed, not sulking.

957
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,160
You're sulking.

958
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:56,440
No!

959
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,560
Look at you.

960
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:58,960
Am I sulking?

961
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,280
I'm pissed off!

962
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,600
Can I have a glass of wine?

963
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,560
Come on, it'll be better
in the bedroom.

964
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,360
Where are you going?

965
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,120
In the bedroom.

966
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,080
Forget I'm here.

967
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,600
Sir? If you'll come this way...

968
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,800
He had a nervous breakdown,
that's all.

969
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,960
It's like being tired,
but incredibly tired.

970
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,240
He's depressed. Understand?

971
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,720
Happens to 20% of the French.

972
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,520
Like piles.

973
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,760
He'll need looking after
for a while.

974
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,240
He's in the nut-house.

975
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,640
20% don't end up in the nut-house!

976
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,200
You're a pain.

977
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,760
The nut-house!
I spent a week there.

978
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,400
- Really?
- Yes.

979
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:57,880
Why?

980
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:01,640
Cocaine, poppers, ecstasy...

981
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,200
Not all at the same time, mind.

982
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,200
They kept me in for nine days,
then a week with my parents.

983
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:11,360
- I preferred the hospital.
- Why, what's it like?

984
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,600
Like a hospital.

985
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,360
You walk in the park,
take medicine,

986
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:19,640
people come and see you
and bring chocolates and flowers.

987
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,440
And the shagging that goes on!

988
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:22,640
Really?

989
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:25,480
Yes. I met
this young schizophrenic there.

990
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:27,520
He fucked me so nicely...

991
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:35,400
You have to go and see him,
talk to him...

992
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,960
Be with him.

993
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,480
Even if it scares you.

994
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,680
Is everything all right?

995
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,120
It's not too hard?

996
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,800
The head nurse
said you're a lot better.

997
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:58,360
What day is it?

998
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,680
Tuesday.

999
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:04,160
Tuesday the what?
What's the date?

1000
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,400
I don't know.

1001
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:25,200
Do you want me to bring you
something next time I come?

1002
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,000
Some condoms?

1003
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,320
No.

1004
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,520
- Or...
- Yes?

1005
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:36,600
Shit!

1006
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,000
I can't remember anything any more.

1007
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,600
Shit! I forget everything
at the moment.

1008
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,080
I want you to bring my lamp.

1009
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,880
I went for a piss the other night
and banged my head.

1010
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,880
It's for his own good!

1011
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:07,320
You had a job as a mechanic.

1012
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,440
Why didn't you go back there?

1013
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,920
I'm not interested,
do you understand?

1014
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,720
Is loafing about all day
so much more interesting?

1015
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,760
- I take photos.
- That's a new one!

1016
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:23,040
You'll end up like Antoine:
no job, no money!

1017
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,200
He's doing really well.

1018
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:28,160
The telly bought
the rights to his play.

1019
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,320
We're rolling in money!

1020
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,720
Give me the keys!

1021
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:36,040
As I promised not to mention
your debt, here's a letter.

1022
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:38,680
What's this?

1023
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,240
A list of things
you could do instead.

1024
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,240
I don't believe this!

1025
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:50,000
"Paint the spare room,
wash the car, clean out the shed"?

1026
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,840
I'll tell you something.

1027
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,400
You know what granddad
once said to me?

1028
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:05,400
He said, "It's sad
but your father's an arsehole."

1029
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,720
Frederic!

1030
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,240
Here are the keys.

1031
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,120
Thanks.

1032
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,160
Tell him you're sorry.

1033
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:33,520
Brown it in butter
with a few onions.

1034
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:37,320
Whole onions, mind.
Watch out, a car!

1035
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,760
Warn me earlier.

1036
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,600
What's the point
when it's already there?

1037
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,840
- Keep an eye out.
- I've never done it before.

1038
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,160
All the same...

1039
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,720
Let's go.

1040
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,920
The sauce is very important.

1041
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:04,080
A bottle of good Bordeaux
and a spoonful of white flour.

1042
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:06,120
Hurry up, will you!

1043
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:09,520
- You're so tense!
- Of course I am!

1044
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:13,200
- Fancy a blow job?
- Leave it out!

1045
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,680
All right?

1046
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:27,360
Surprise!

1047
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,120
I've fixed it.

1048
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,040
I had a hard time
getting all the parts.

1049
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,880
Second surprise.

1050
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,760
To my folks' country home!

1051
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:40,160
We can go as often as we like.
Nicolas and me cleaned it up.

1052
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:43,280
It took us four days
but it's spotless now.

1053
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:46,520
You'll be able to rest there.
We can go tonight if you like.

1054
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,960
Great, eh?

1055
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,760
Come on, up you get.

1056
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,640
- What are you doing?
- Taking the bus.

1057
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,360
But I'm taking you.

1058
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:03,360
I'm not going to Nicolas' place,
I'm going to my mum's.

1059
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,400
Hang on.

1060
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,160
Wait, Antoine!

1061
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,600
We can go later on if you like.

1062
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,520
I'll drop you off at your mother's.

1063
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,880
What the hell's wrong with you?

1064
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:35,800
I'm sorry. No, wait...

1065
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,440
I'll drop you at your mother's,
no problem.

1066
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:42,560
I don't want to see you any more.

1067
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,320
It's over between us. Finished.

1068
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,800
Why do you say that?

1069
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:51,920
What did I do?

1070
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:21,320
You bastard!
I cleaned the whole fucking house!

1071
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:24,520
Are you taking the piss or what?

1072
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:30,640
You know what? You can fuck off
and die, you wanker!

1073
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:31,720
Mental case!

1074
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:36,200
Look at me, you bastard!
Look at me, you fucker!

1075
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,040
You fucking wanker!

1076
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:01,640
He's not in.

1077
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:05,760
I know but he's not in.

1078
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,440
Goodbye, Frederic.

1079
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,640
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

1080
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,720
Antoine. When did you get out?

1081
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,920
A month ago.
I'm staying with my mum.

1082
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,600
You said I could come
and stay with you when I got out.

1083
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,680
I'm moving out.

1084
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:57,480
I'm moving in with Henri.
He'll be here in a minute.

1085
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,400
- Never mind, then.
- No, come in.

1086
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:01,800
Come on.

1087
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,120
I can't even make any coffee.

1088
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,160
It makes me hallucinate, anyway.

1089
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,600
We have to talk.
I haven't seen you for weeks.

1090
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:28,040
- Aren't you going to let him in?
- He'll go away again.

1091
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:38,840
Sylvie?

1092
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,520
Are you there?

1093
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:38,400
It's mostly in the morning,
sometimes at night, that it hurts.

1094
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,160
Right here, you see?

1095
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,720
All I can tell you is,
it'll pass.

1096
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,960
All by itself.

1097
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:53,600
You sleep better, you see things,
you breathe...

1098
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:55,960
You're less afraid.

1099
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:59,120
And one day
you realise it's gone.

1100
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:02,360
How long does it take?

1101
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,960
Fifteen years, at least!

1102
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:05,920
Move your elbow.

1103
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:10,800
I've got your toe
on my left testicle.

1104
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,440
You should be so lucky!

1105
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:14,720
I'm getting a hard-on.

1106
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:17,280
We haven't really got room!

1107
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:26,200
It's like a scene
from one of your plays.

1108
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,920
Agnes!

1109
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,240
Do you have a Minitel?

1110
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:47,640
What a pain!
It's in the corridor.

1111
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:54,840
Valerie. My name's Frederic,
I'm a friend of Antoine's.

1112
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,360
He's told me a bit about you.

1113
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,800
In fact, he's done nothing
but talk about you.

1114
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:03,800
He's told me how you met,
about your first nights together,

1115
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,880
about how you broke up,
about your life together,

1116
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:09,560
he's played me
your favourite music.

1117
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:12,160
He often says
you're the "love of his life".

1118
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,840
He loves that expression.

1119
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:15,920
He thinks it's tragic.

1120
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,400
I don't suppose any of this
makes any sense to you.

1121
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,560
I've been telling him that
for years.

1122
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:26,360
But today I'm doing
what he's often dreamt of doing:

1123
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,280
I'm writing to you.

1124
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:31,440
I wouldn't have done this
but for a serious development.

1125
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:33,440
Antoine got ill.

1126
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,760
I don't know how or why.

1127
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:39,760
He spent three weeks
in a psychiatric hospital.

1128
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:41,920
He's not gone mad,

1129
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,920
it was his nerves.

1130
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:45,920
He was depressed.

1131
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,080
Like 20% of the French.

1132
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:51,520
He just needed looking after
for a little while.

1133
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:55,000
He got out two months ago
but he won't see me any more.

1134
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,440
I don't know why.

1135
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:59,920
I wish I could write like him.

1136
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,280
I want to ask an odd favour of you,

1137
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,840
and I hope this letter
convinces you.

1138
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,120
It pains me,
not being able to help him.

1139
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,600
I get the feeling
he thinks it's all my fault.

1140
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:15,160
I don't think that's fair
and I can't get it off my mind.

1141
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,200
I'm asking you to help him
and to help me.

1142
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,480
I need it.

1143
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:23,720
I thought it better to write

1144
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,240
so you wouldn't feel
under pressure.

1145
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,240
I'll wait in the cafe opposite
until five.

1146
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:32,840
I'll be drinking a beer,
or a coffee if there's no draught.

1147
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,520
I'm tall, quite handsome,

1148
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:37,960
and there'll be a blue helmet
opposite me.

1149
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:46,400
You're not that handsome.

1150
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,440
Hi. All right?

1151
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,640
Well, there you go...

1152
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:27,400
I'll leave you.

1153
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,120
Do we know each other?
Who are you?

1154
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,960
"Do we know each other?
Who are you?"

1155
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:40,360
I think I'd better stop
taking the tablets.

1156
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:42,080
I lived with Valerie.

1157
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:44,400
She got married
and left me the flat.

1158
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,160
Your friend slipped this
under my door.

1159
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:49,360
So, anyway...

1160
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,360
With one thing and another...

1161
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,440
She got married?

1162
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:00,880
Who to?

1163
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,640
A big bloke. Nice.

1164
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,720
She used to talk about you
like a sailor lost at sea.

1165
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:10,200
So when your pal showed up
I couldn't resist it.

1166
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:12,520
My name's Lorette.
This is OK, eh?

1167
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:19,680
I'm sorry.

1168
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:22,120
Why?

1169
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,000
I don't know.

1170
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:27,920
It's embarrassing.

1171
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,600
It's full of spelling mistakes.

1172
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:33,440
Don't be shy.
We're almost like old friends.

1173
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,120
I don't know anything about you.

1174
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:44,160
You pal's sitting over there,
looking all tragic.

1175
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,920
- Are you going?
- Yes, to work.

1176
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,880
What do you do?

1177
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,160
Social worker.

1178
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,560
No, I'm joking.
I work in a bank.

1179
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,880
I won't go into details,
you're depressed as it is!

1180
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,160
I was so looking forward
to meeting you I haven't eaten.

1181
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:09,080
We could meet again if you like.

1182
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,520
It's up to you.
Tomorrow?

1183
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:16,280
I'd like that but I'm not
great company at the moment.

1184
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,160
I'm obsessed with death.

1185
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:19,160
Ennui.

1186
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,160
I've no appetite,
can't get a hard-on,

1187
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,120
I live with my mum
and I watch telly.

1188
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,320
I haven't talked for ages.

1189
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,080
I'll need a three-hour nap
to get over this.

1190
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:33,680
- My stomach's rumbling.
- Are you hungry?

1191
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,160
Do you want my sandwich?
Go on, it's no sacrifice.

1192
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:39,920
I usually give it to the pigeons.

1193
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:43,120
There they are, look.
Waiting for it.

1194
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:51,800
Thanks, Antoine. See you tomorrow.
You will be here?

1195
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,920
Yes. Or on the bench opposite.

1196
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:17,320
- All right?
- Yes.

1197
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:20,240
Still staying with Nicolas?

1198
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:24,120
Not for much longer. I'm looking
at a studio flat in Vanves.

1199
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,040
That's good.

1200
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:34,320
Were you pleased to see Valerie?

1201
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,120
Yes, I was pleased.

1202
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:39,640
She's really pretty.

1203
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,600
She's not as small
as you made her out to be.

1204
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,040
Going to see her again?

1205
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,400
I don't know. Maybe.

1206
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:51,280
Well, I'll be off.

1207
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:55,040
Hang on...
Were you really pleased?

1208
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:57,400
Yes.

1209
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:00,160
I didn't know, you see,
I wasn't sure.

1210
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:05,400
I'd better go, I'm tired.
Thanks.

1211
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,320
I'll tell you something.

1212
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,000
I'd always hoped you'd do that.

1213
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,600
Pass it! Behind the tree!

1214
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,360
Go on!

1215
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,240
Hey, sonny!
