1
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,929
It'll be ready in 10 minutes.

2
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,925
Maybe twelve... fourteen minutes.

3
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,841
No! 10 and that's it.

4
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,448
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

5
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,567
Would you care for a drink?

6
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,250
We don't drink,

7
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,442
but we will while we wait.

8
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,921
- Wait for what?
- For our meal.

9
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,203
A good and copious one.

10
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,209
Are you the chef?

11
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,687
No, it's my brother.

12
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,166
I'll let him know.

13
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,848
Cigalon!

14
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,361
Cigalon!

15
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,728
- What?
- They want to eat.

16
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,321
Eat what?

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,126
I don't know. They want to eat.

18
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,606
I thought so.

19
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,484
Yes Sir?

20
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,963
First, an aperitif.

21
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,802
Picon for me
and Quinquina for the others.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,968
Sidonie, get the drinks.

23
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,924
And bones for the dog.

24
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,526
Yesterday's leftovers.

25
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,446
Good. What do you suggest for us?

26
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,927
What will you eat?

27
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,567
If he's a chef, I'm an omnibus.

28
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,484
Is the old bag mad?

29
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,405
Well, she's slightly nuts

30
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,170
but she's harmless.

31
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,970
It's her birthday.

32
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,487
Happy returns.

33
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,763
That's why I promised
the whole family

34
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,725
a feast to be remembered.

35
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,287
- So here we are.
- I see.

36
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,802
- Here you are.
- Here we are,

37
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,361
here we are here.

38
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,886
Tell me, what's on the menu,

39
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,730
I mean, generally?

40
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,644
A local speciality?

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,686
With all the poachers around,
what we eat most

42
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,081
is game.
- Game?

43
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,841
- What sort?
- Well, small birds are my favourite.

44
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,287
White tails, red tails...

45
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,767
How are they cooked?

46
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,169
- How do I cook them?
- Yes, how?

47
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,605
I spit-roast them wrapped in bacon.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,968
I make a vine wood fire,

49
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,248
I set the roasting spit,

50
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,729
the birds melt,
the juice drops on the bread,

51
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,526
nice fat slices of country bread.

52
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,849
When they're done,
I remove the livers,

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,130
I chop them and spread them
on the toast.

54
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,164
I serve with a fresh crunchy lettuce

55
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,290
and the lightest touch of garlic.

56
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,410
It's a pure delight.

57
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,364
It sounds good.

58
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,040
So we'll have small birds.

59
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,044
- Have you got them?
- No!

60
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,482
- Where are they?
- Here!

61
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,366
- I don't have any.
- How come?

62
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,126
I have no thrush, no sparrow,
nothing!

63
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,049
Why mention birds then?

64
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,722
I didn't,
I was just answering questions.

65
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,401
- So what will we eat?
- Yes, what?

66
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,411
- What will you eat?
- You tell us.

67
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,528
I'm not a magician.

68
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,081
You'll eat what you've brought.

69
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,651
We brought nothing.

70
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,325
So you'll eat nothing.

71
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,767
- Not possible!
- I'm afraid it is.

72
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,409
- You're hungry?
- Terribly.

73
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,762
Really hungry, I mean,

74
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,729
you're ravenous?

75
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,042
- I'm about to faint.
- Sorry.

76
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,846
Truly. But I've got nothing

77
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,530
except for the dog.

78
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,046
Eat, good dog.

79
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,408
Isn't this a restaurant?

80
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,683
It's Written: RESTAU RANT.

81
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,564
What do your patrons get?

82
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,687
This! Isn't it wonderful?

83
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,524
Don't say it's not!

84
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,690
Even the old lady wouldn't deny it!

85
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,611
It's wonderful but we're hungry.

86
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,690
You've been here 10 minutes

87
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,049
and all you talk about is eating.

88
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,248
What else in a restaurant?

89
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,204
This not a real restaurant.

90
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,084
It's a view,

91
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,123
people eat with their eyes.

92
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,484
- Can you make an omelette?
- Yes, I can.

93
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,123
But I won't ever serve one.

94
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,768
An omelette! Me, a chef!

95
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,611
You're as mad as the old bag.

96
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,885
A cream pollard, yes.
A crayfish soup, yes.

97
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,844
But an omelette!

98
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,010
I won't bother for an omelette.

99
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,648
You cook roast chickens!

100
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,569
I used to but not anymore.

101
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,525
- Or fish soup.
- Not today.

102
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,041
- What for then?
- For nothing!

103
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,328
I can't be bothered.

104
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,443
Give me the eggs,
I'll cook it myself.

105
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,051
Where?

106
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,005
- In the kitchen.
- Are you joking?

107
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,804
A stranger in my kitchen?

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,480
My pans in unskilled hands?

109
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,002
No, thanks.
I'm too zealous a chef!

110
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,928
I've got it.

111
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,648
You're not a chef.
You've never been one.

112
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:12,163
Sir, I was a chef

113
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,125
at the Noailles Hotel
and at the Splendid.

114
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,688
I found the famous
stuffed pheasant recipe.

115
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,043
It was lost for centuries.
I modernised it

116
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,323
by adding 15 drops of garlic juice.

117
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,007
My name is in the Golden Book
of French cuisine.

118
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,202
Doesn't that make me a chef?

119
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,961
For 30 years, Sir,
the man in front of you

120
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,243
mused over my stove
and melted as I mused

121
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,647
and mused as I melted.

122
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,571
Shrove Tuesday goose,
Christmas turkey,

123
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,684
Spring woodcocks
and Autumn larks

124
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,644
sweating in their lard coats.

125
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,810
I was hotter than they were

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,082
because I was not rotating.

127
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,886
I roasted on my front side only.

128
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,889
Me! Not a chef?

129
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,642
If we were on the beach,
you could see it for yourself.

130
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,411
I'm all creased up, wrinkled.

131
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,285
My navel is as crunchy as a biscuit.

132
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,131
And here you are, telling me

133
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,731
that I'm not a chef!

134
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,085
That's a hard one to hear, Sir.

135
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,805
Real hard.

136
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,286
He may be a chef, who knows?

137
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,370
Maybe, but he can't prove it.

138
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,006
You want me to prove it?

139
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,850
Is this a court?

140
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,725
You want me to prove it? I will.

141
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,046
Come, Sidonie!

142
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,131
That wasn't so hard after all.

143
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,684
Mutton feet and tripe
Ã© la Provengale.

144
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,961
Move closer.

145
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,962
Listen!

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,082
Glug glug glug...

147
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,251
The slight but continuous bubbling

148
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,240
cooks the tripe
and tenderizes the feet.

149
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,884
I cleaned the fresh tripe myself.

150
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,923
I parboiled the feet,

151
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,091
at a special temperature
known only by me.

152
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,728
And now, smell it.

153
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,763
You smell it?

154
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,564
- Perfect.
- Pure art!

155
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,366
Give me some, I want some!

156
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,369
You're too greedy!

157
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,922
- Am I not a chef?
- You definitely are.

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,368
Smell it one more time.

159
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,049
Am I not a great chef?

160
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,765
You are.

161
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,769
A great chef.

162
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,804
Write it down in our Golden Book.

163
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,761
"Cigalon is a great chef."

164
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,927
With pleasure.

165
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,289
I'll add:
"Thank you

166
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,084
"for the marvellous feet and tripe."

167
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,361
Please.

168
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,483
- Let me eat!
- You'll get some.

169
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,286
No, she won't.

170
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,086
It's sacred. It's my dinner.

171
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,921
I gave you proofs.
That's all I can do for you.

172
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,568
Don't you dare snatch it from me.

173
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,126
That's a lesson for you.

174
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,930
I don't have your subtlety.

175
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,684
You'll eat in front of us?

176
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,042
I'll have to if you stay here.

177
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,004
I wouldn't if I were you.

178
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,089
- You're stupid!
- Really!

179
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,886
You made us walk here to watch

180
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,286
a chef eating.

181
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,001
What a criticism!

182
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,044
A chef who eats.
Because for you,

183
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,242
a chef isn't supposed to eat.

184
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,330
For 35 years, I ruined my appetite,

185
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,249
tasting the others' food.

186
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,321
But now, that's finished.
The game is over.

187
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,251
I sit at the best table

188
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,647
and I eat the best dish

189
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,047
cooked especially for me.

190
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,842
This is a disgrace.

191
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,963
I'll write to the Guild

192
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,528
a detailed letter of complaint.

193
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,451
- How subtle of you.
- You jerk!

194
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,689
You're ridiculous!
That's why he mocks you.

195
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,327
Me? Ridiculous?
Yes, I am ridiculous,

196
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,488
because I'm too kind,

197
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,603
because I married

198
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,643
a vicious and obstinate woman.

199
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,808
Don't listen to this brute.

200
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,809
You can go.

201
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,485
You know what it's like to be stuck

202
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,730
with an ill-tempered and mad wife?

203
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,490
You know what it's like

204
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,364
to eat feet and tripe

205
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,962
surrounded by a bunch
of bickering idiots?

206
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,245
Well, it is intolerable
and I won't tolerate it.

207
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,921
Beat it, you and your family!

208
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,929
Go and quarrel
in another restaurant.

209
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,684
Leave me alone!

210
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,282
I've a right to rest in my own house

211
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,086
on a Sunday!
- Come, auntie.

212
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,722
Thanks for your welcome.

213
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,522
And the fine cuisine.

214
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,601
And such a pleasant day.

215
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,280
We'll recommend you
to our friends.

216
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,807
See you soon.

217
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,126
Your tripe is delicious.

218
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,248
Only you can cook it so well.

219
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,721
A secret.

220
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,850
My secret.

221
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,530
It's sad to think
that when I die,

222
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,442
nobody will ever eat it
cooked this way.

223
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,207
I know your recipe is a secret

224
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,121
but you could write it in your will.

225
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,720
My secret

226
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,728
is the boiling temperature.

227
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,927
The exact degree.

228
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,407
I've never told anyone.

229
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,762
Not even you. I won't tell.

230
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,684
The secret will die with me.

231
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,606
You're wrong.

232
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,361
I'm pleased to be wrong for once.

233
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,007
Because since I'm always right,

234
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,010
it'll be my first little flaw.

235
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,527
God will have one thing
to pardon me for.

236
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,250
Fancy, Mrs Toffi!

237
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,204
- Hello.
- Hello.

238
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,370
Hello Mr Cigalon, Mrs Cigalon.

239
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,370
- Miss, if you don't mind.
- Sorry.

240
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,491
You're touring the countryside?

241
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,365
Yes, I've come with my nephew.

242
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,483
He's just finished
his military service.

243
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,921
- Say hello!
- Hello.

244
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,329
- They enrolled him?
- For one year.

245
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,731
It's hard
but you learn a thing or two,

246
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,001
it makes you smarter.

247
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,322
He looks smart.

248
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,568
Take a seat if you like.

249
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,326
How is the laundry business?

250
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,128
Linen will always get dirty

251
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,049
and need to be cleaned.

252
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,449
- But I've stopped working.
- Is that so?

253
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,602
I sold my business.

254
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,406
- I have enough.
- What will you do?

255
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,723
I've come to see you

256
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,922
about a delicate matter.

257
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,211
Sit down.

258
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,206
- You want to borrow money?
- No!

259
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,165
- Just as well. I'm not lending.
- Thanks.

260
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,606
I have money.

261
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,769
I've known you for a while.

262
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,400
That's why I came to tell you

263
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,080
what I'll do before I do it.
- So?

264
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,282
I'm through with laundries

265
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,689
so I thought of opening a restaurant.

266
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,928
A restaurant?

267
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,131
That's a clever woman

268
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,323
who wants to please people

269
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,851
and make money.

270
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,845
She wants to open a restaurant

271
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,522
and whose advice does she want?

272
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,521
Mine! Bravo! Have an orange.

273
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,201
Who else could I talk to?

274
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,767
I'll give you my advice.

275
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,803
And that's precious.

276
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,164
Because I've given the matter
a lot of thought.

277
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,881
As a journalist,

278
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,966
I'd have written many columns.

279
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,123
Let's take some distance.

280
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,050
A luxury place on the main avenue

281
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,642
is good business.
The harbour is different.

282
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,006
Around Endoume,
the atmosphere is particular.

283
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,846
For the Chartreux area, it's simple:

284
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,011
I know everyone's tastes and habits,

285
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,249
the temperature,
the smells and the climate.

286
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,602
- Are you with me?
- Quite.

287
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,484
But first things first:

288
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,602
Where is it?

289
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,165
It's here.

290
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,481
You want to buy the restaurant?

291
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,286
No, I want to open another one.

292
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,165
Here, in the village,
next to my restaurant

293
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,330
specialised
in home made preserves?

294
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,607
Why not?

295
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,525
A restaurant?

296
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,290
Where people can eat?

297
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,166
A place where they can eat well.

298
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,762
I rented Toine's house
and ordered repairs.

299
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,969
They start tomorrow, hence my visit.

300
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,161
I've heard things in my life,

301
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,011
insolent and presumptuous things,

302
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,885
slander, dirty talk and abuse.

303
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,208
But such impudence, never!

304
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,641
Never!

305
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,322
Oh God!

306
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,002
Cigalon! Here, drink!

307
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,330
The feet and tripe got stuck...

308
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,567
Drink!

309
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,680
Jesus!

310
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,211
- Feel better?
- Yes.

311
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,728
- Take the orange back!
- Here.

312
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,400
How dare you do this to us?

313
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,364
Our own laundress!

314
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,682
Don't be upset, calm down.

315
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,410
Let me explain.

316
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,251
Many people visit the area,

317
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,280
especially on Sundays.
And you won't serve them.

318
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,171
Why do you object if I serve them?

319
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,408
You won't lose anything.

320
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,927
I'll tell people my condition:

321
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,367
"I can't serve you

322
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,841
"unless Cigalon turns you down."

323
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,168
They'll come here first.

324
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,044
I'll send them all to you.

325
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,683
Her restaurant will look as a stable!

326
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,531
She's already seeing guests!

327
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,041
She thinks she's a restaurateur!

328
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,571
Look,

329
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,848
this is hilarious.

330
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,644
I'm in stitches.

331
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,284
- It doesn't show.
- It's not a stable.

332
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,131
Don't say it is
because it is not.

333
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,523
I know a stable when I see one.

334
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,201
You can't make the difference:

335
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,483
an ass thinks a stable
is a restaurant.

336
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,445
A 20m long dining-room!

337
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,246
Electrical lighting
and at the back,

338
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,442
a bowered terrace.

339
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,684
- A bowered terrace?
- Yes, for lovers.

340
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,811
A bowered terrace for lovers!

341
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,171
What a disgrace!

342
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,688
A place where people
have to bring their food.

343
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,922
With a lantern at the door!

344
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,323
What a shame!
That's all we needed.

345
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,841
Pots and pans worth 4000 francs!

346
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,287
Who will be cooking

347
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,688
in that so-called restaurant?

348
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,530
- I Will.
- She Will!

349
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,251
I can picture it!
This is insane!

350
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,522
Senile delirium.

351
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,203
Nothing to be mad about.

352
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,090
Good, don't get mad.

353
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,602
Silly woman!
Can you make the difference

354
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,491
between a stew cooked in ironware

355
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,250
and one in crock ware?

356
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,329
- No, I can't.
- She can't!

357
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,205
Can you cook Milanese minestrone?

358
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,007
She can't.
What about Cumberland sauce?

359
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,242
And Oxtail Hotchpot?

360
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,171
- Answer me!
- I don't know!

361
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,800
I admit you can cook everything.

362
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,088
But you never cook!

363
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,721
A good restaurant can make money

364
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,843
so I'm opening one.

365
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,530
Mine is opened!

366
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,489
But you won't serve people.

367
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,962
You won't lose any money
if I feed them.

368
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,608
I don't care about money.
I have money.

369
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,809
It's a question of honour!

370
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,241
I'm a restaurateur.

371
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,171
Whether I serve people or not,

372
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,169
I don't want competition.

373
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,484
If you dare open a hashhouse,

374
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,205
I'll ruin it.

375
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,888
We shall see.
I came to inform you

376
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,441
out of respect for you.
- Respect!

377
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,170
It's an offence!

378
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,891
- An offence?
- You come to our house

379
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,560
while we're having lunch

380
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,603
to declare a war!

381
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,962
That's respect for you!

382
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,282
May I know the day and time

383
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,166
when you turn on
your stable stoves?

384
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,011
I've nothing to hide.
On 10 July.

385
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,209
It gives us 2 months to fight back.

386
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,722
Now leave immediately.

387
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,201
You might steal my cooking secrets.

388
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,409
Cover the tripe
so she can't smell it.

389
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,166
- I've got a cold anyway.
- Go away!

390
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,169
The place is closed.

391
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,765
Don't bother.

392
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,485
I need no advice.

393
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,364
Don't bother closing,

394
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,006
it's never been open.
- Beat it!

395
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,567
I'll reopen it!

396
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,001
We shall see!

397
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,851
Go back to your stables!

398
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,045
Look at your sad face!

399
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,209
This is stupid!

400
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,644
Closing for preparatory works!

401
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,161
Come with me.

402
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,881
- Hello.
- Sir?

403
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,485
A word with you.

404
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,524
I'm listening.

405
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,287
I want to say that I'm ready.

406
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,403
- For what?
- To open tomorrow.

407
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,762
I'm ready too.

408
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,769
To serve sausage, olives?

409
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,167
Anchovies, salads?

410
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,967
And on special occasions,
a fried egg!

411
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,288
While you declaim recipes

412
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,448
without feeding anyone!

413
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,210
I have a proposition

414
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,449
but I'd rather speak inside.

415
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,201
The restaurant is not open yet.

416
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,849
Nobody will see it
before the inauguration.

417
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,802
Very well.

418
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,129
I'll sit here.

419
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,842
Now, listen carefully

420
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,247
and sit down.

421
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,848
You came to my place,
in my village,

422
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,767
near my restaurant
to open your canteen.

423
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,564
- I could have been upset.
- You were!

424
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,445
- You nearly choked.
- I could've choked you.

425
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,044
- I didn't.
- Thanks.

426
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,720
I could have ignored you

427
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,321
and simply laughed it off.
- Simply.

428
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,443
Laugh it off and ignore it.

429
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,728
I didn't.

430
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,005
I took your ridiculous project
seriously.

431
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,646
Selling pork sausage...

432
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,046
Donkey.

433
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,607
- Why?
- Donkey sausage.

434
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,280
It wasn't the idea in itself,

435
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,931
but I was shocked

436
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,168
to see how cheeky,

437
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,567
how shameless you were!

438
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,484
- A canteen...
- It is not a canteen!

439
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,043
Not a canteen, but it's a challenge.

440
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,770
I took it up.

441
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,845
Since, I've been working in the day

442
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,246
and thinking at night.

443
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,683
And this morning, I thought:

444
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,528
Cigalon, you're going
to crush this woman.

445
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,567
- Crush?
- Yes.

446
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,921
- How?
- As a bug.

447
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,731
That's nice. You're very polite.

448
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,882
You're a gentleman.

449
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,366
- Then?
- Then,

450
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,166
I looked at the newly painted walls,

451
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,886
the set tables,
the flowers in vases,

452
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,489
the most sophisticated rotisserie

453
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,160
and the shiny copper pans
on the wall.

454
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,930
Yes indeed!

455
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,929
When I walked in the kitchen,

456
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,647
I caused an eclipse.
Then I looked at the chef,

457
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,764
in his chef's outfit.
A fork in one hand

458
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,930
and a barding needle in the other.
I exclaimed:

459
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,244
"He's got style!"

460
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,603
- You hired a chef?
- No, just me in the mirror.

461
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,450
Then I thought

462
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,050
I'd awakened from a long sleep,

463
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,685
looking 10 years younger.

464
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,201
What do I owe this to?

465
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,687
To my neighbour's challenge.

466
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,723
Am I going to crush her?

467
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,642
No!

468
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,524
- Why not?
- You won't.

469
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,242
Poor child!

470
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,010
I won't crush you.

471
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,407
I'm grateful to you.

472
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,484
Mrs Toffi, thank you.

473
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,728
Yes, thank you.

474
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,400
You're welcome.
You know,

475
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,523
your restaurant may look good.

476
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,722
But you'll see mine tomorrow.

477
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,407
A stable, donkey sausages!

478
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,284
Well, I must thank you.

479
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,608
And I'll say something more.

480
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,849
- What?
- Hold the chair and don't cry.

481
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,407
I'll propose something great,

482
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,171
because I'm a kind man.

483
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,169
Please yourself.

484
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,523
It's to please you, Virginie.

485
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,807
Virginie,

486
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,448
I'm marrying you!

487
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,928
Are you crazy!

488
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,969
I may be.

489
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,046
- Are you serious?
- Serious and reasonable.

490
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,447
Sit down.
Let's see the benefits of my plan.

491
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,530
This place becomes an annex

492
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,008
to sell ham, sausages
and store preserves.

493
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,282
There'll be a few tables

494
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,086
for the chauffeurs, the staff,

495
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,089
umbrellas and birds.

496
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,170
My restaurant will be a success

497
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,206
because we're a perfect
and complementary match.

498
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,806
I'll devise the menu.

499
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,485
I'll peel the potatoes.

500
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,682
- I'll welcome the guests.
- And I'll clean the floor.

501
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,406
- I'll talk to the guests.
- I'll wash up.

502
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,523
A perfect marriage!

503
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,366
My sister is delighted.

504
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,050
Deep inside,

505
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,249
she likes you and so do I, Virginie.

506
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,408
- I do like you.
- That's news.

507
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,284
This is not new.

508
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,563
Remember that young laundress

509
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,606
who used to come to a hotel kitchen

510
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,762
for the cooks' dirty clothes

511
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,447
and return them spotless?
A young cook

512
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,291
invited her for a day out.

513
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,728
She flatly refused.

514
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,446
It's my nicest romantic memory.

515
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,326
Virginie, give me your hand.

516
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,568
No.

517
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,200
" No?
" No!

518
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,846
Why? Won't you marry me?

519
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,042
- Certainly not.
- Wretched woman,

520
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,969
come to my restaurant.
- No.

521
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,083
It's my turn to speak.

522
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,487
You don't take me seriously.

523
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,364
You think I'm joking.

524
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,291
It doesn't matter anyway.

525
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,482
I don't want to marry any man.

526
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,808
I married twice, and a half.

527
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,882
And a half?

528
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,281
Two husbands and a weakness.

529
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,330
The 1st took my money,
the 2nd also.

530
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,090
The 3rd sold my furniture.

531
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,645
Now you understand.

532
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,683
You can't compare me...

533
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,770
Yes I can. You're even worse.

534
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,042
Because you're nuts.

535
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,366
- Nuts?
- Nuts!

536
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,244
- You're mad!
- You are!

537
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,568
You're a self-admirer.

538
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,286
You're always the best.

539
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,050
I couldn't stand it.

540
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,641
I can see through your plan.

541
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,322
- I know where the wind comes from.
- Meaning?

542
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,927
You're scared of me.

543
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,088
Your restaurant can't survive.

544
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,009
The trade is mine.

545
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,124
So, to avoid competition,

546
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,483
you thought of marriage.
It's not on.

547
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,211
No more speeches.

548
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,528
Go back to your eclipse

549
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,529
while I cook omelettes.

550
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,404
Are you perfectly sane?

551
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,570
- Yes.
- And you refuse to marry Cigalon?

552
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,967
Let me tell you...

553
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,447
Who do you think you are?

554
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,926
- Let me...
- A tyrant

555
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,044
using his sister
and too lazy to cook.

556
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,730
A wicked man

557
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,604
intent to ruin a good woman.

558
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,007
I will open my inn

559
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,009
and have more guests than you.

560
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,330
If you make half my profits,
I'll marry you.

561
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,921
Let me tell you...

562
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,246
- What?
- Nothing!

563
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,761
Good bye!

564
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,282
Hear, hear!

565
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,926
Mrs Toffi informs the population

566
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,884
of the village

567
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,922
that she will open her inn
next Sunday

568
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,844
and serve meals.

569
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,164
Homely, shady bowers
and electricity.

570
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,408
Hear, hear!

571
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,208
Madam!

572
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,931
The war is on!

573
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,686
I will crush you!

574
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,722
AT MRS TOFFl'S INN
YOU CAN EAT

575
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,923
CIGALON'S RESTAURANT
SPECIALISED IN EVERYTHING

576
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,247
- Hello Mrs Toffi.
- Hello.

577
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,681
- Is he busy?
- Not one guest.

578
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,850
Only 2 trams will stop here now.

579
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,644
He must be furious.

580
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,167
They're all avoiding him.

581
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,044
What about you, how many?

582
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,641
9 on the terrace and 5 inside.

583
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,249
Maybe more will come.
Those on the terrace are tourists.

584
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,728
They've ordered only filtered water.

585
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,686
Look, the noon tram passengers
coming up.

586
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,322
Probably quite fancy.

587
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,444
The food must be better next door.

588
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,004
It's overpriced!

589
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,802
Go, Gentlemen! Go to the inn,

590
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,646
to eat omelettes cooked in petrol,

591
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,525
battery birds and donkey sausage.

592
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,766
There's no chemist in the village.

593
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,042
To buy paregoric,

594
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,242
you'll have to walk a mile.

595
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,090
Shut up, you clown!

596
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,964
Fancy chef!

597
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,331
No, nothing can replace butter.

598
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,887
To cook you need to be a chef.

599
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,806
You can become a laundress

600
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,684
but being a chef is inborn.

601
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,088
You're right.
A trip will do you good.

602
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,644
I can't, I'm broke.

603
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,048
Then they'll get you.

604
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,240
No. I know where I'd be safe:

605
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,848
In prison.
- Maybe.

606
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,164
Let me tell you.

607
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,608
The guards keep you in

608
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,529
but they keep the others out.

609
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,200
If I come out after 6 months,

610
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,921
the matter will be settled.

611
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,562
You don't decide go to jail
just like that.

612
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,606
Easier than going to Oxford.

613
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,800
Maybe.
But when you are where you said,

614
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,930
you can go out at anytime.
In prison,

615
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,086
6 months can turn into 5 years.

616
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,011
- Depending on the judge.
- And the crime.

617
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,441
There's a maximum sentence.

618
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,768
- I know what to do.
- Pickpocketting?

619
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,525
- No. Chiseling.
- What's that?

620
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,362
You eat in a restaurant
and after brandy, you say:

621
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,721
I've no money.

622
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,765
Then they call the cops.

623
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,531
15 days, suspended.

624
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,529
Not the third time.

625
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,602
Done it before?

626
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,849
I'll do it again today.
Be my guest.

627
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,401
They'll leave you alone.

628
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,411
But before they call the police,

629
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,331
all the waiters will beat us up.

630
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,364
I'd rather not be part of it.

631
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,562
But at 13.40,

632
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,240
I'll think of your backside.

633
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,085
I'll cry for you.

634
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,248
Cry with laughter.

635
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,771
You can laugh.

636
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,446
You've chosen the place?

637
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,168
No but I've chosen the jail.

638
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,768
I like Aix prison. It's cosy.

639
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,770
- Melun is better.
- Not really.

640
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,969
How would you know. Been there?

641
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,767
- No.
- A palace. It beats Fontainebleau.

642
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,564
Maybe, but I can't afford the trip.
I've 50 francs left.

643
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,888
I'll take a cab

644
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,771
and stop at a posh restaurant.

645
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,969
See the sort I mean?

646
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,764
I trust my luck.

647
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,123
- The chef won't be so lucky.
- Too bad.

648
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,407
Taxi!

649
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,365
- Ciao, Vicco.
- Ciao.

650
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,369
In that restaurant,

651
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,081
if the waiters are like this,
don't go in.

652
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,282
Ciao!

653
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,570
- Cigalon?
- What?

654
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,683
There's a blister on the fowl.

655
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,042
Damn it!

656
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,166
The spit's stuck.

657
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,964
A 30-franc guinea-fowl!

658
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,562
So delicious. The one who eats it

659
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,161
is a lucky man.
- The lucky man

660
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,930
has not arrived yet.

661
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,971
He will.
When you cook a fowl

662
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,889
as noble as this,

663
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,487
on such vine wood fire,

664
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,921
mysterious things happen.

665
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,804
This roasting bird

666
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,082
will inform the local gourmets.

667
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,204
Their flaring nostrils
sniff at the wind

668
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,890
and they come here.

669
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,121
It's 12 o'clock and nobody's come.

670
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,607
The next tram is at 1 o'clock.

671
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,485
Who cares about trams?

672
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,764
Would a gourmet catch a tram?

673
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,530
Poor girl.

674
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,247
A gourmet has a delicate bottom

675
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,091
and fears wooden seats.

676
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,126
The man who will eat this
can only come by car.

677
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,687
Cars rarely come to the village.

678
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,683
One will come today.

679
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,487
Listen! An engine!

680
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,490
Really!

681
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,442
Keep the change.

682
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,560
He's a gourmet.

683
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,602
Sir!

684
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,402
Sir!
Count!

685
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,928
- Did you call me "count"?
- Yes.

686
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,531
Don't make a mistake

687
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,246
unworthy of a man like you.

688
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,091
I don't know you
but I understand you.

689
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,123
Aren't you here on your own

690
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,567
to enjoy a good meal?

691
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,888
- Absolutely.
- This way, then.

692
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,844
Follow me.

693
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,842
Thief!
Aren't you ashamed

694
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,804
to tout people like this?

695
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,442
Don't mind her, she's my laundress.
Come.

696
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,763
No he won't!

697
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,042
- Easy!
- Don't you dare

698
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,288
hassle the Count.

699
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,686
And what for?

700
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,047
You intend to cook for him?

701
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,164
- Yes.
- You think boiling dirty linen

702
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,169
can be compared to cooking?

703
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,488
Count, a laundress can just

704
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,491
bleach a sauce and wash ravioli,

705
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,331
grill a steak with an iron!

706
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,043
Better have your linen
cleaned by me

707
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,242
than eat her food.

708
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,442
- Follow me.
- No, he won't.

709
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,405
He won't serve you. He can't cook.

710
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,523
- This is an insult!
- Eclipse!

711
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,485
- Donkey sausage!
- Dressing as a clown

712
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,011
won't impress him.

713
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,407
You'd better come to my inn

714
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,204
before it's booked up.

715
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,324
You shouldn't bring this ladle here.

716
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,081
It stinks of cod liver

717
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,647
and axle grease. Wait...

718
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,923
don't smell it, it'll ruin your palate.

719
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,566
Come with me.
- Virgile!

720
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,641
Look! He's taking away
our best customer.

721
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,247
- He was coming our way.
- True.

722
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,523
And this crook snatched him away.

723
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,643
He won't get away with it.

724
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,286
- There's a witness.
- I saw it too.

725
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,767
This man was about to go in

726
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,247
when the statue rushed to him.

727
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,364
Our witnesses have
their own witnesses.

728
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,489
Sir, tell us the truth.

729
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,485
- You'd chosen our restaurant?
- He had!

730
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,570
But as he was at the door,

731
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,922
he felt sick and turned to me.

732
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,770
Not at all!

733
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,927
He didn't.

734
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,487
Cigalon is a rich man

735
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,445
who wants to deprive a widow.

736
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,086
I need customers. Come with me.

737
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,681
- I'll look after you.
- You're poor?

738
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,486
Not really poor, nor really rich.

739
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,966
I work for a living.

740
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,408
I work for art!

741
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,127
I'll go to his place.

742
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,048
- To the richest!
- He's right.

743
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,125
A rich chef is a good chef.

744
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,569
God will punish you. Be prepared.

745
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,082
I'll take you to court!

746
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,089
Shut up, woman!

747
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,282
Bed sheet cleaner!

748
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,970
Shirt ironer!

749
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,924
Collar starcher!

750
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,010
The Count wisely
made the difference!

751
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,884
- Abusing me publicly!
- Don't cry, auntie.

752
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,844
Don't cry.
I'll eat at your place.

753
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,769
And better than there.

754
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,849
The omelette's burning!

755
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,366
Your hat...

756
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,881
Cloakroom service!

757
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,809
Quick! Quick!

758
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:36,050
Take care of the Count's hat.

759
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,330
- You want to eat good food?
- Good food.

760
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,204
An aperitif?

761
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,721
What? No, no aperitif.

762
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,764
Right. Aperitifs ruin the palate.

763
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,246
Starters?

764
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,211
No starters.
Those appetizers

765
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,050
ruin your appetite.

766
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,603
A gourmet! One at least!

767
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,770
Would you like my advice

768
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,123
or would you like
to choose yourself?

769
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,126
I trust you
to choose the dishes

770
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,483
in season,
suitable for the day

771
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,410
and for me.
- Good.

772
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,001
What about the price?

773
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,084
Never mind.

774
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,282
Really.

775
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,286
Great.
I'm not a greedy man.

776
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,211
But an artist needs freedom

777
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,244
to create a masterpiece

778
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,250
according to his taste,
instinct

779
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,800
and supplies.

780
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,880
You'll be fully satisfied.

781
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,804
Thanks for trusting me.

782
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,081
I'm confident.

783
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,282
It'll be a fair price.

784
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,524
I bet it Will be.

785
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,600
The best guest! In a car!

786
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,770
And so distinguished!

787
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,764
A noble man!

788
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,803
Noblemen are pigs!

789
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,562
No.
Look, he has only one guest.

790
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,161
- We have 15.
- They eat nothing.

791
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,282
They'll survive.

792
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,291
They can die but not here.

793
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,008
A 10-franc bill each!

794
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,126
They ordered sausage, fried eggs,

795
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,085
a lamb chop and cheese.

796
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,726
Nothing. Whereas the other...

797
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,809
Don't cry, auntie.

798
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,525
He must have ordered

799
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,888
two meat dishes for himself.

800
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,525
What can we do?

801
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,002
Come here, lad!

802
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,368
Come here.

803
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,767
Go and see
what the man is eating.

804
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,167
Tell me how many plates.

805
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,005
Hurry up!

806
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,644
Not a good idea.

807
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,645
It'll only hurt your feelings.

808
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,203
Don't think he'll eat
a 1000-franc meal.

809
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,803
He looks smart
but he's no millionaire.

810
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,770
Soup fish Ã© la Provengale.

811
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,042
Made with rock-fish.

812
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,489
One kilo of scorpionfish.

813
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,805
Capelan, angler fish, John Dory

814
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,650
and some seafood.

815
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,605
Still wriggling when I boiled them,

816
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,770
as if they where applauding me.

817
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,611
- You deserve it.
- Thank you.

818
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,565
Who is this?

819
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,081
- A Gypsy?
- He's just curious.

820
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,885
Come in, boy.

821
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,890
Come closer and have a look.

822
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,164
This is a rare thing: a good meal

823
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,807
eaten by a gourmet.
A complete success!

824
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,004
Watch carefully and never forget.

825
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,927
Delicious.

826
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,447
Thanks.
Now, the next dish.

827
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,561
Bouillabaisse.
Virgile!

828
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,721
Virgile!

829
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,880
- He's having bouillabaisse.
- Really?

830
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,084
- So he's from Paris.
- I knew it!

831
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,363
A lot of bouillabaisse?

832
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,881
4 platefuls of spiky fish.

833
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:13,922
Scorpionfish!

834
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,168
Bouillabaisse with scorpionfish.

835
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,601
He'll charge him 40 francs.

836
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,126
For a Parisian,

837
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,322
it's normal.
- Let me add up.

838
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,646
What for?

839
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,049
To see how much he cheated us.

840
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,926
Bouillabaisse: 40 francs.

841
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,202
- Drink?
- White wine.

842
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,048
- A wax-sealed bottle?
- Red wax.

843
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,725
Sealed!

844
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,207
We could have sold the same!

845
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,243
We don't have any.

846
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,010
We have wax.

847
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,926
With wax, you can seal a bottle.

848
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,166
Sealed wine: 12 francs.

849
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:52,609
12 francs.
Listen, go back there.

850
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,245
Stand close to the man,

851
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,680
very close.
And see

852
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,325
if it smells good.

853
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,807
Hurry. I'll give you 20 cents.

854
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,651
Sealed wine: 12 francs.

855
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,241
It's not finished!

856
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,211
Spit-roasted guinea fowl

857
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,922
slightly sprayed with chives elixir.

858
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,970
Toast with foie gras from Toulouse.

859
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,284
Fresh lettuce.

860
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,607
And now, some music.
Go and get it.

861
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,245
Music?

862
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,648
Just be prepared.

863
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,681
- Perfectly cooked.
- Look at it!

864
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,847
The wings

865
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,528
come off easily.

866
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,451
Now the breast.

867
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,328
- The bird must be costly.
- Yes.

868
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,931
If you eat it all,

869
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,925
it'll cost you 60 francs.
- I'll eat it.

870
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,011
<i>"I'll</i> eat it all!"

871
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,562
60 francs.

872
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,169
You're my first guest
who is happy

873
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,600
to hear the price.

874
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,082
Sundays make me happy.

875
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,722
Here's the music.
Wine waiter, come closer.

876
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,681
Burgundy wine, Count.

877
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,361
Not heavy but joyful.

878
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,966
Melodious.

879
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,325
15 years in the cellar.

880
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,044
It's a quiet,

881
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,804
unpretentious wine,

882
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,886
but it has a soul.

883
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,363
This wine sings

884
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,167
and dances to its own song.

885
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,882
It'll dance on your tongue

886
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,647
and leave a kiss on your lips.

887
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,250
A guinea fowl.

888
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,249
At least 50 francs.

889
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,884
We could have served him
guinea fowl.

890
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,641
Be reasonable.
We don't have guinea fowls.

891
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,569
- We could have made one.
- What with?

892
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,162
The parrot.
Once plucked and cooked,

893
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,323
it won't speak.
Who will know?

894
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,560
A guinea fowl: 50 francs.

895
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,161
We've been waiting 15 minutes

896
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,486
on the terrace.

897
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,648
Waiting for what?

898
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,211
For guinea fowls?

899
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,687
Why slave for 10 francs?

900
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,326
I won't get rich selling sausage.

901
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,848
Go and see what they want.

902
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,122
Anchovies and olives I bet.

903
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,011
Even in a big restaurant,

904
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,010
I've never used leftovers
for the ravioli.

905
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,250
And I've never cooked cannelloni.

906
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,566
What's so special in cannelloni?

907
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,770
Cannelloni is
a square piece of pasta.

908
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,281
You roll it like a cigarette

909
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,209
and stuff it with leftovers,

910
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,607
sad spinach and sausage.

911
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,167
Poor choice.
In fact cannelloni

912
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,045
is like a waste bin:

913
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,647
they clear the kitchen leftovers.

914
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,207
No need to throw them away,

915
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,368
give them to the customers.

916
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,927
But not here.
Whereas Mrs Toffi

917
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,803
must serve them often.

918
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,409
Come here, my boy. Listen.

919
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,883
<i>Go to Mrs Tom's.
Count the guests,

920
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,560
see what they eat.
You'll tell me.

921
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,001
I'll give you 20 cents.

922
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,201
Give them now.

923
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,886
You're suspicious, good.
Here.

924
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,890
I've just been there.

925
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,682
The terrace is full of tourists.

926
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,566
She can have tourists

927
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,923
and the quantity.
I have the quality.

928
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,681
What did they order?

929
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,882
- Filtered water.
- Water!

930
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,723
Serves her right.
What about the food?

931
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,366
- They brought their own.
- They did?

932
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,608
Really! Very thoughtful of them.

933
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,246
Mrs Toffi, poor laundress,

934
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,681
you tried to double-cross me,

935
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,008
to humiliate Cigalon.

936
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,884
The Lord punished you.

937
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,484
Here, 20 cents more.

938
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,844
Wait... Here.

939
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,446
You have a serious grudge
against this lady.

940
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,085
Are you bad-tempered?

941
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,802
I'm a faithful friend
and a patient servant.

942
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,684
But it's tit for tat.

943
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,802
- Tat?
- Yes.

944
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,043
What do you mean by "tat"?

945
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:04,250
"Tat" means to defend yourself.

946
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,523
"Tit" is to attack.
You attack, I react.

947
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,600
No forgiveness.

948
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,049
I can't stand vicious people.

949
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,330
This malevolent woman
back-stabbed me.

950
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,364
It's unbearable.
It drives me mad.

951
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,925
That's annoying.

952
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,205
And worrying.

953
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,281
Still, you wouldn't go to extremes?

954
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,244
- Sorry?
- You wouldn't...

955
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,282
kill someone?

956
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,768
I don't know.

957
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,361
Frankly, I don't know.

958
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,322
Maybe.
Let's not waste time.

959
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,251
Cheese, fruit, brandy

960
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,046
and cigar.
- If you insist.

961
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,243
Sir, I swear it.

962
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,249
When the man came here,

963
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,842
it was to have lunch.
I saw it in his eyes.

964
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,326
Didn't you?

965
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,323
He had made up his mind.

966
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,802
He had a customer's look.

967
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,129
He walked as a customer.

968
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,765
He was hungry.

969
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,323
In any case, he didn't come in.

970
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,522
He didn't.

971
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,370
So Cigalon didn't really rob you.

972
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,529
What of this 200-franc bill?

973
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,290
He stole 200 francs.

974
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,610
The terrace people.

975
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,451
The filtered water eaters.

976
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,688
Give them the pond water.

977
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,405
And now, Count,

978
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,728
as it's your first time here,

979
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,968
please do me a great honour.

980
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,567
Come and visit my kitchen.

981
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,481
It's an honour for me.

982
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,406
This way please.

983
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,770
Follow me.

984
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,571
And the brandy?

985
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,921
How much for it?

986
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,884
Brandy? As you like.

987
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,367
Ignore her, Count.

988
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,961
My sister is rambling.

989
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,527
Don't count the brandy.

990
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,684
If you don't mind, it's on the house.

991
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,166
It's logical,
all is on the house.

992
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,841
All?

993
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,731
The whole meal.

994
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,242
Really, I can't.

995
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,204
It makes no difference.

996
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,244
I have no dough.

997
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,489
Poor as a church mouse.

998
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,887
- Sweet lord!
- It's a joke.

999
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,051
I'm not joking.

1000
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,249
First, I'm not a count.

1001
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,680
And I'm skinned.

1002
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,601
All you can do is call the police.

1003
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,645
- It's not true?
- It's true.

1004
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,525
I gave my last note to the driver.

1005
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,405
Sit down.
Give him some water!

1006
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,526
Keep your hair on,

1007
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,763
old miser!

1008
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,203
Listen, I haven't got a cent.

1009
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,209
I'm really broke.

1010
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,402
I came here to eat well

1011
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,762
and be arrested.
It's crucial.

1012
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,804
- Have me arrested!
- Sidonie! Get the police.

1013
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,322
- Virgin Mary!
- Quick!

1014
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,522
Go and get the police!

1015
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,041
I'll hold him at gun point.

1016
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,004
- Hands up!
- Why?

1017
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,087
Hands up, thief!

1018
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,602
Blink and I blow your head off.

1019
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,121
Don't aim at me.

1020
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,368
I won't go. I don't want to.

1021
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,562
I did it to be arrested.

1022
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,570
Shut up and don't move.

1023
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,768
I allow you to say a prayer,

1024
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,770
but keep your hands up.

1025
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,769
It's going off on its own.

1026
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,361
This barrel's empty.

1027
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,289
But the other is loaded.

1028
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,164
Just watch it!

1029
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,921
Gangster, jail bird, ruffian,

1030
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,363
you're a criminal, a bandit!

1031
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,691
I'll shoot you for good.

1032
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:59,846
He's mad. I told him.

1033
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,923
I could see he was no nobleman.

1034
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,849
A 30-franc guinea fowl!

1035
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,930
A chef with a difference!

1036
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,688
- He's visiting the kitchen.
- God!

1037
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,360
That's for the bill.

1038
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,210
Don't worry, auntie.

1039
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,131
- He's just a guest.
- Of course.

1040
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,607
- Others will come.
- Others!

1041
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,724
But not him. The one with a car,

1042
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,924
with gloves,
and who eats a lot,

1043
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,208
who doesn't check the bill,

1044
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,050
an extortionate bill.

1045
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,203
What's that whistle?

1046
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,090
A busy can.

1047
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,365
Strange can.

1048
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,602
A speciality. It's ripening.

1049
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,121
It's done.

1050
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,766
Listen, put it in the sun.

1051
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,524
I'll throw it out.

1052
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,927
Don't move!

1053
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,687
- It's going to explode.
- Not yet.

1054
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,405
How do you know?

1055
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,489
Habit. The 100th explodes.

1056
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:05,761
I had 100.

1057
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,569
- Explosive?
- Every one!

1058
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,206
Change supplier.

1059
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,044
I don't need advice!

1060
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,969
And stop fidgeting!

1061
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,288
You're off the line of fire.

1062
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,687
- Stop moving
- I'm nervous.

1063
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,245
- Listen.
- What?

1064
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,727
Why not aim at me outside?

1065
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,560
You can't choose the place.

1066
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,171
The victim chooses!

1067
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,086
Then, he tasted all the cheeses.

1068
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,567
Then, he ate fruit.

1069
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,922
Then he had coffee.

1070
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,567
Then, 2 glasses of brandy.

1071
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,684
Then he had a cigar long like this.

1072
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,050
Then he showed his empty pockets
and said:

1073
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,609
"I've no dough."
- Chiseling.

1074
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,770
Cigalon's guarding him with his gun.

1075
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,684
He'll get 3 to 6 months.

1076
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,730
Cigalon thought
he was a nobleman!

1077
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,490
He was mistaken.

1078
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,287
He shouldn't have.

1079
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,047
Jesus! It's bubbling!

1080
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,643
It's a sign of relief for the hole.

1081
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,524
It might not explode.

1082
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,001
You're sure?

1083
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,966
- Scared?
- You would be too.

1084
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,685
A self-firing gun

1085
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,484
and an exploding can!

1086
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,047
Eating my fowl didn't scare you.

1087
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,003
A well-cooked fowl is not scary.

1088
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,771
Now, the hole is jammed!

1089
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,406
It's going to explode!

1090
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,728
What are the cops doing!

1091
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,282
Human justice is always slow.

1092
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,524
What makes this can bloat

1093
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,563
is God's justice.

1094
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,240
It's a mighty bloat!

1095
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,244
Wait for the cannonade!

1096
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,243
I must tell Cubisol.

1097
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,801
This isn't a can,

1098
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,651
it's artillery!

1099
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,447
A shower of tomato sauce.

1100
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,930
It will ruin your suit,

1101
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,806
your thief's smart suit.

1102
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,087
Help!

1103
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,846
It's just a flying lobster!

1104
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,769
Let me go out, I'm sick.

1105
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,166
Don't move!

1106
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:42,410
- Diarrhoea!
- Thieves' diarrhoea is God's justice.

1107
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:45,248
In the village,
2 restaurants

1108
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,771
can't make a living.

1109
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,010
If I'd known
that Cigalon was serving food,

1110
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,089
I wouldn't have opened one.

1111
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,044
He takes the best guests.

1112
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,924
- It won't last.
- It will.

1113
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,327
He's cunning.

1114
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,329
Not as mad as he looks.

1115
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,009
The police!

1116
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,882
Virgile!

1117
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,003
The police are at Cigalon's!

1118
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,567
The police? What's happened?

1119
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,327
At ease!

1120
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,290
- Here's our customer.
- A shady one.

1121
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,450
What a battlefield!

1122
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,365
What's this?

1123
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,131
A canned lobster.

1124
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,688
The cannery didn't do a good job.

1125
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:43,405
The lobster is ruined.

1126
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,887
Crabillon.
A new recruit.

1127
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,811
A new word for you:
crustacean.

1128
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,007
Lobsters, snails and turtles
are crustaceans.

1129
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,721
Prepare the table.

1130
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,923
Ink and paper to write my report.

1131
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,610
You're not familiar with chiseling,

1132
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,644
so it's a chance for you to learn.

1133
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,764
Look at what I'm doing,

1134
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,644
listen to my words.

1135
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,766
If you're clever
you could become a sergeant

1136
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,282
and be in the same position as me.

1137
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,888
This is chiseling,

1138
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:29,169
and probably violence.

1139
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,763
This man tried to attack the plaintiff

1140
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,601
with cans and crustaceans.

1141
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,401
- Is that right?
- Not at all.

1142
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,080
Crabillon, it's not that at all.

1143
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,521
- Not at all.
- Let's not rush it.

1144
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,165
Let's hear the story.

1145
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,443
Just one thing though.

1146
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,646
In a case, there's a plaintiff
and a defendant.

1147
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,649
The plaintiff is this man.

1148
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,571
The defendant is this character.

1149
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,881
Stand up.

1150
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,445
Sir, tell your story.

1151
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,007
- He's eaten and he won't pay.
- Not so fast!

1152
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:08,927
This is not a conversation
but an inquiry.

1153
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,651
I want a story with more details.

1154
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,689
- What did he eat?
- Here,

1155
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,211
the bill.
- Good.

1156
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,400
- Are these original characters?
- What?

1157
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,611
He's the character.

1158
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,328
I mean is this bill

1159
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,761
the original, it's not a copy?

1160
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,168
Isn't one enough?

1161
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,327
You want a copy?

1162
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,644
So it's the original.
Crabillon,

1163
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,929
examine this bill.

1164
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:40,283
What question comes to your mind?

1165
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,082
- He ate all this?
- Heartily.

1166
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:46,851
- Blimey!
- Crabillon!

1167
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,929
No swearing on a case.

1168
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:51,686
He ate it all!

1169
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,487
Shit! He has a strong stomach.

1170
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,284
He can't breathe.

1171
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,040
Your gun stopped my digestion.

1172
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,171
The food is sitting on me.

1173
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,448
Why scare me like that?

1174
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,040
I wasn't escaping.

1175
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,720
- Now I'm sick.
- He does look pale.

1176
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,129
I could sue for death threats.

1177
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,641
- Sue!
- I heard him.

1178
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,411
- You're a thief and you want to sue?
- Why not?

1179
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,683
This is too much!

1180
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,202
Crabillon, slap the thief.

1181
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,971
Sit down to receive it.

1182
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,687
- A hard or soft one?
- Ordinary.

1183
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,245
One more! Go on!

1184
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,126
No! One's enough.

1185
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,326
So he ate...

1186
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,768
The man is not stupid.

1187
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,325
He refuses to pay.

1188
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:47,126
And Cigalon dares call the police.

1189
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,005
- It's a shame.
- And bad publicity.

1190
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,891
This man was absolutely right.

1191
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,327
Shut up, scandalmonger!

1192
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,570
Aren't you ashamed, at your age?

1193
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,570
Me, a scandalmonger?

1194
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,411
Did I need to call the police?

1195
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,602
Don't mix things up.

1196
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,804
My guests are satisfied,
yours won't pay.

1197
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,730
The man's right.

1198
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:14,481
His meal isn't worth
more than 50 francs.

1199
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:15,727
No more.

1200
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,605
But you said it was worth 200.

1201
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,922
Before the police came.

1202
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,766
But with the police, it's 50.
He's right.

1203
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:29,091
We declare:
he refused to pay

1204
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,530
because he had no money.

1205
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,651
Consequently,

1206
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,129
Mr Cigalon accused him
of chiseling.

1207
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,803
Accordingly, we,
police officers,

1208
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,765
arrested him immediately.

1209
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:53,728
I feel sick.

1210
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,809
Now he's being rude.

1211
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:59,169
Crabillon, give the thief
another slap.

1212
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,521
- Same type?
- Yes.

1213
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,726
Thanks, I feel better.

1214
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,964
What I need is bicarbonate.

1215
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,847
All we need is him vomiting
on the terrace.

1216
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,248
I'm already ridiculed,

1217
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,363
he'll give me a bad name

1218
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,767
if he's sick in my kitchen.

1219
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,481
What is it, what do you want?

1220
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,648
You, herd of gazing cows!

1221
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,285
You'll break my fence.

1222
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,085
Can't we watch?

1223
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,926
Shut up, cannelloni eater!

1224
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,646
Don't breathe on my shrubs!

1225
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,724
You, school teacher,

1226
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,645
staring like a dummy.

1227
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,440
Here, the cops write the bills!

1228
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,925
You, cuckold, instead of spying me,

1229
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:01,810
watch your wife!

1230
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,287
That's enough! Go away!

1231
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,961
Otherwise I'll sue you

1232
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:08,286
for disturbance at night.

1233
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,411
Or worse:
disturbance at night in the sun.

1234
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,081
Here, drink this.

1235
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,840
Criminal!

1236
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,601
Feeling better?

1237
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,644
- Yes, thanks.
- The taxi's still here

1238
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,729
since the driver's outside.

1239
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,009
Finally, I won't sue you.

1240
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,168
- Come on!
- Look outside.

1241
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:37,045
If they spread the news, I'm ruined.

1242
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,641
They'll make songs about it.

1243
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,810
I'm losing money but not my honour.

1244
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,287
So we came here for nothing?

1245
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,960
This is questionable.

1246
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,969
I'll offer the drinks.

1247
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,530
- We haven't eaten.
- We'll feed you.

1248
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,611
And you, yobbo, silly bastard,

1249
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,009
when you feel better,
get out of here.

1250
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:03,968
No! I don't want to go.

1251
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,446
What do you mean?

1252
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:06,971
They must arrest me.

1253
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,691
Why do you want to be arrested?

1254
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,291
Why?

1255
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,166
Why?

1256
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,327
- Because I'm scared.
- Of what?

1257
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,325
Last week, they arrested FrisÃ©,

1258
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,090
Favouille and Gras-Double,

1259
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,209
the bank cashier's killers.

1260
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,165
They're going to be guillotined.

1261
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,560
Probably.

1262
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,406
They planned the robbery

1263
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,250
in a bar on the port.

1264
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,683
That day, I was in the same bar.

1265
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,322
- You understand?
- No.

1266
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,522
What link with my guinea fowl?

1267
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,925
They were arrested

1268
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:47,009
on someone's denunciation.

1269
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,043
Their friends think it's me

1270
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,730
and they want to kill me.

1271
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,604
I understand.

1272
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,809
The other day, in the street,

1273
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,407
they made holes in my hat.
- What with?

1274
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,090
With two bullets.

1275
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:02,564
Yesterday, when I opened my door,

1276
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,889
the lock exploded,
it was booby-trapped.

1277
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,561
I wasn't seriously injured

1278
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,923
but my navel is bigger now.

1279
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,282
Is it really possible?

1280
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:14,687
I'll show you.

1281
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:15,922
That's enough!

1282
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,607
Respect my sister.
We believe you.

1283
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,808
Ok, I won't insist.

1284
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,971
I was scared, where could I hide?

1285
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,129
They'd find me anyway.

1286
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:30,006
But if I was sent to jail,
I would be safe.

1287
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,526
I must be arrested.

1288
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:33,643
- Arrest me.
- They can't,

1289
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:37,003
I'm not suing.
- If he insists,

1290
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,771
we have motives.
I'll arrest him.

1291
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,685
Just slap the sergeant hard.

1292
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,008
- Sergeant?
- Certainly not!

1293
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,362
If you do, I'll arrest you.

1294
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,403
That's what I want!

1295
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,364
Don't arrest him here.

1296
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,608
He's my customer,

1297
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,484
my uninvited guest.

1298
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,287
Well, if he wants to slap
a police officer,

1299
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:03,041
a serious offence,
he can slap another, elsewhere.

1300
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:06,364
If someone must be slapped,

1301
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:10,167
why not Camoins-les-Bains
Superintendent?

1302
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,526
The four-eyed one.

1303
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,046
Clever idea.

1304
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,447
Yes, he objected to my ads.

1305
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,041
If you slap him, I'll forgive you.

1306
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,448
How long will I get for it?

1307
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:22,280
4 to 6 months.

1308
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,647
4 to 6 months?

1309
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,603
Still, slapping the sergeant now
is tempting.

1310
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,849
You want to harm me again?

1311
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,088
No, it wouldn't be fair.

1312
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,922
Life is a compromise.

1313
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,130
Ok, the Superintendent.

1314
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,169
Excellent.

1315
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,730
Is my taxi here?

1316
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,970
- My hat and gloves.
- Quick, Sidonie.

1317
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,085
- The taxi?
- What?

1318
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,886
- Who will pay him?
- Not the Super.

1319
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:00,447
Not me either.

1320
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,051
Certainly not me!

1321
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,091
So he won't be paid.

1322
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,490
You'll cheat this honest driver

1323
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,284
of 10 or 12 francs?

1324
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:12,291
Sir, I won't have any of this.

1325
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,568
I know what you have:

1326
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,001
free bread and guinea fowl.

1327
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,124
I won't argue anymore.

1328
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:23,806
I give you 3 minutes to pay him,

1329
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,163
otherwise I'll slap the sergeant.

1330
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,364
- What if it was chiseling?
- Chiseling!

1331
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,767
It's guinea fowl,
the boy saw it.

1332
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,288
No. I mean a crook,

1333
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,608
someone with no money

1334
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,211
who eats his meal

1335
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,890
and won't pay for it.

1336
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,366
He could be.

1337
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:49,490
It'd be too good to be true.

1338
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:52,725
I could cry with joy.

1339
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,282
You'll arrest him if he slaps you?

1340
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:02,245
- Henceforth.
- You mean immediately?

1341
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:04,966
Immediately. Henceforth.

1342
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,688
If Mrs Toffi wasn't sneering
on the terrace,

1343
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:20,249
with 30 other fools,
I'd skewer him.

1344
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:23,889
But I have to surrender.

1345
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,164
Here's what we'll do.

1346
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,366
You must accept,
otherwise I'll use my gun!

1347
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,402
Easy!

1348
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:34,644
I'll give you 150 francs.

1349
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,809
Give 100 to the driver

1350
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,004
and 50 to me, publicly.

1351
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,208
With complimentary words,

1352
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,131
you'll congratulate me:

1353
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,402
"You're a wonderful chef.

1354
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,931
<i>"I'll</i> come again."

1355
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,407
Please come and have lunch.

1356
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,204
The chicken is cooked,

1357
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,641
we'll share it.
- With pleasure.

1358
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,046
Let's eat

1359
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,084
before we hear
from the police station.

1360
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,607
Don't go away!

1361
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,451
You must see
Cigalon's punishment.

1362
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,650
Children, come closer!

1363
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:16,049
Look at the gentleman
being arrested

1364
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:18,527
and Cigalon looking furious.

1365
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:19,562
The moral:

1366
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,445
cheat people and you'll be cheated.

1367
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,923
Auntie, here they come!

1368
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,411
The Count's car!

1369
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,923
This meal was excellent
and quite cheap.

1370
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,487
Count, you're too kind.

1371
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,650
- You're an artist.
- I'm honoured.

1372
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,689
You deserve it.

1373
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,649
Keep the change.

1374
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,808
It's too much...

1375
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,849
To Camoins-les-Bains.

1376
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,531
Mrs Toffi,

1377
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,922
don't cry.

1378
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,921
You made a scandal,
you wanted to outdo me,

1379
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,691
and said a foolish thing:

1380
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:21,723
"His customer won't pay."

1381
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:24,128
But he did, look at the tip.

1382
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,004
I'll give it to Virgile.

1383
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,368
Take this note.

1384
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,369
I've made enough profit.

1385
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,651
You're clever.

1386
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,411
More clever than you think.

1387
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,170
Remember your promise.

1388
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,840
- What promise?
- You said:

1389
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,327
"if you earn more than me..."

1390
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:45,361
Don't say it publicly.

1391
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:48,564
Virgile, go and see to the inn.

1392
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:51,411
Your aunt is coming with me
a moment.

1393
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,010
The police and my sister are there.

1394
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,445
She'll be safe.

1395
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,328
But I may not return her.
