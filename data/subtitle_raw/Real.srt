1
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,500
I wonder what's the reason. 

2
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,500
I have a feeling that I've been living with you since the day I was born.

3
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,000
And so it will always be.

4
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,700
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

5
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,300
Of course we will!

6
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,700
No doubt about it.

R E A L
The Day The Plesiosaur Became Real

8
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,900
[ 1 year later ]

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,100
Fujita-san, it's about time.

10
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Okay.

11
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,700
Everyone is nervous at the first time.

12
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,700
Yes.

13
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:33,200
To be true, I also don't know what you feel when you enter the mind of another person.

14
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,600
But until now, everyone who succeeded found the experience fulfilling.

15
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,100
No, Aihara-sensei,

16
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,500
I'm not worried about the procedure.

17
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:46,800
I simply...

18
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:46,810
You're worried about Atsumi-san?
I simply...

19
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,300
You're worried about Atsumi-san?

20
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,100
Yes.

21
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,000
Does she really want to see me again?

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,600
The purpose of this process is exactly to find out what she's thinking now.

23
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,700
As I explained before,

24
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,500
you and Atsumi-san are medically a good match

25
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,500
and you also have a strong spiritual bond.

26
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,900
The only person who's capable to enter her mind is you.

27
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,200
I know.

28
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Of course, it may be hard for you to face the reasons why she committed suicide a year ago.

29
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,100
But, Fujita-san,

30
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,000
in order to wake her up from this deep coma

31
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,100
we need your help.

32
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,100
Alright.

33
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,000
Hello.
I'm Yonemura, the neurosurgeon.

34
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,900
Please lie down there.

35
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,500
Now I'll set up the interface.

36
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,700
Fujita-san, can you see that monitor?

37
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,700
Yes.

38
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,600
This device contains around 300 coils.

39
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,900
They record the electromagnetic activity which is produced by your brain.

40
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,300
By this procedure the electric impulses inside of your brain are transmitted

41
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,900
to the patient's brain.

42
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,000
If two persons are connected by such an interface,

43
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,800
they can communicate like normal in a virtual reality.

44
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
This is, simply put, how this machine works.

45
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,300
Don't worry.

46
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,300
You'll feel as if you were dreaming.

47
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,100
Each session lasts for an appointed time,

48
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,500
but if one of you unconsciously shows a strong negative reaction, I will immediately terminate it.

49
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,400
I understand.

50
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,100
Fujita-san,

51
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,700
it's important not to rush things.

52
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,800
During your first contact be careful and proceed step by step.

53
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,500
Then it will be a success.

54
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,300
Welcome home.
You're late.

55
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,000
I bought two lunchboxes for dinner.

56
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,200
If you're hungry, eat.

57
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,900
Thanks.

58
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,100
How was your day at the sports club?

59
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,500
Well...

60
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,600
[ Roomi ]

61
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,700
Atsumi, say,
are you doing this all the time?

62
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,200
What?

63
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,100
Manga.
From morning till night.

64
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,900
I must observe the deadline.

65
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,800
I see.

66
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,600
I'm sorry, but I have no time for you now.

67
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,200
Koichi.

68
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,000
Do you remember the plesiosaur drawing?

69
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,400
The plesiosaur.

70
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,300
Remember.
I think we were in 4th grade of elementary school

71
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,200
when I showed you the plesiosaur drawing on the island.

72
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,800
Really?

73
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,600
You said you wanted to have it, so I gave it to you.

74
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,000
Was there really such a thing?

75
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,900
What?
You don't remember?

76
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,900
So what's with this drawing?

77
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,400
That plesiosaur drawing was a perfect.

78
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Koichi, do you think we can find that drawing somewhere?

79
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't know.

80
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
Can't you help searching for it?

81
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,000
If I could take a look at that picture again, I might

82
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,400
regain my confidence as a manga creator.

83
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay, I'll try to find it.

84
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,100
Somehow I feel weird.

85
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,300
I'm totally relaxed while I'm drawing manga,

86
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,000
but once my hand stops, I start feeling dizzy.

87
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,100
The weight of this pen,

88
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,400
I don't feel it anymore.

89
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,100
Look!

90
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,600
Atsumi.

91
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,600
I have to tell you something.

92
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,500
What?

93
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,200
Stay calm and listen to me.

94
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,900
This here is not reality.

95
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,500
We are inside of your mind.

96
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,300
One year ago,

97
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,100
you were exhausted from drawing manga and tried to commit suicide.

98
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,300
You jumped into the sea from the quay wall, don't you remember?

99
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,000
Really?

100
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,400
Thank God, your life was saved, 

101
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,100
but since then you're lying in a hospital bed in a coma.

102
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,400
But now, thanks to a special equipment,

103
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,600
I have direct contact to your mind.

104
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,900
Tell me,

105
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,400
why did you do that?

106
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,000
Attempting suicide?

107
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,700
I don't remember.

108
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,100
Was it perhaps my fault?

109
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,800
If it's so, tell me please.
I will accept it.

110
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,800
So please wake up!

111
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,600
We can leave this place

112
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,400
and start over again.

113
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Then help me to find it.
The plesiosaur drawing.

114
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
Okay.

115
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,010
I'm busy with drawing manga now.

116
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,560
Manga, manga...
Stop with this now.

117
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,300
Life isn't only about manga.

118
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,440
My life is!
Manga is my life!

119
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,940
Then, what about me?

120
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,480
Are you saying I must choose between you and manga?

121
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,000
No, I didn't say that.

122
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,100
I only say our life together comes first,

123
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,600
and then we should think about how to deal with your manga.

124
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,800
And how?

125
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,000
I don't know yet,

126
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,400
but our life revolves only around manga.
Isn't that weird?

127
00:12:55,710 --> 00:13:00,630
So I should give up work and take care of you only.

128
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,900
Then you would be satisfied, right?

129
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,800
I didn't say that!

130
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,700
Fujita-san, can you hear me?

131
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,700
You're at the Medical Center.

132
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,500
I know.

133
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,500
This session lasted only one hour.

134
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,400
What did you experience?

135
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:10,580
We were at home.
Atsumi was drawing manga.

136
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,000
I talked a little with her.

137
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,960
It felt completely real.

138
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,380
That's why I spoke with her in my usual way.

139
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,400
In the end, we quarreled...

140
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,800
It was a success!

141
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,930
A great experience, wasn't it?

142
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,810
Fujita-san, congratulations!

143
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,200
Your first contact was a success.

144
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,790
Oh, excuse me.

145
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,000
I needed some physical activity.

146
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,100
Then, continue please.

147
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,300
Atsumi was continuing with the manga series where it was interrupted one year ago.

148
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,000
As if time had stopped.

149
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,800
I see.

150
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,100
She thinks I'm still working at that sports club where I quit 1 year ago.

151
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,500
And, she asked me to look for a drawing of a plesiosaur.

152
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,100
Plesiosaur?

153
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,130
She said she drew it for me when we were in elementary school.

154
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,100
But I don't remember.

155
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Why does she want such a thing?

156
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,680
She said if she saw it again, it might help her out of her slump.

157
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,000
Do you think you can find it?

158
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,520
If I search, I guess I can find it somewhere, probably.

159
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,700
Please try to find it.

160
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Okay.

161
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,200
Did you notice anything else?

162
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,900
I saw one of the characters Atsumi had drawn actually appearing in the room.

163
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,200
Only for a moment, however.

164
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,000
What kind of character?

165
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,500
A corpse.

166
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,880
A corpse?

167
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:39,100
It's unusual for a female cartoonists, but
Atsumi was famous for her realistic and grotesque style.

168
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:44,190
And, her serial manga "Roomi" deals with murders.

169
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:46,000
"Roomi"?

170
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:53,030
It's a sign the murderer always leaves beside his victims.

171
00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:01,540
It was a manga series, so Atsumi was constantly thinking about the character of the next victims.

172
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,400
And such an image appeared in the room, right?

173
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Yes.

174
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:10,460
This could be a kind of side effect.

175
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,000
What do you mean?

176
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:20,350
The contact stress can lead to interferences between your brain and Atsumi's mind.

177
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:25,000
This can be the cause of hallucinations.

178
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:33,000
It's possible that from now on these imagines will appear in your real life too.

179
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,400
If anything happens, inform me please.

180
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,500
Alright.

181
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,800
The drawing of a plesiosaur, right?

182
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,800
Yes.

183
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,600
I wonder if Kazu-sensei has such a thing.

184
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,100
When did she draw it?

185
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,400
I was still living on the island then.
About 15 years ago, I guess.

186
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Then, shouldn't it be in your parents' house?

187
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,900
In my parents' house?

188
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,600
Or in the storage room.

189
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,700
Storage room?

190
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,400
Yes, a lot of her stuff is stored there.

191
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,500
Really?
I didn't know.

192
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,000
What's this?

193
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,500
Could it be an unpublished manga of Kazu-sensei?

194
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,000
Yeah, that's possible.

195
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,500
It's great!
She created something like this.

196
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,300
Perhaps it can be published.

197
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,000
I'll call Sawano-san.

198
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,400
Sawano-san?

199
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,700
Here's Takagi.

200
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,300
I was sorting Sensei's papers when I discovered something amazing.

201
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,500
An unpublished work.

202
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,600
Yes, that's right.

203
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,700
Her fans will be exited, won't they?

204
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,700
Yes.
Yes, understood.

205
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,400
Then, I'll drop it off at the office.

206
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,200
Yes.
Yes, good-bye.

207
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,400
Takagi-kun, listen.

208
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,600
Before you publish it, I would like to ask Atsumi for permisson.

209
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,100
I think I'll soon be able to speak with her about it.

210
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,500
I understand.

211
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,700
You're right.
She might have a reason to hide it.

212
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,800
Okay, I'll take it along and talk with Sawano-san.

213
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,600
Takagi-kun, are you going to the office now?

214
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,500
Yes.

215
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,100
I'll give you a ride.

216
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,500
I also want to take a look at that storage room.

217
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,000
You and Kazu-sensei were childhood friends, right?

218
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,700
Yes, but only during elementary school times.

219
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,700
On Hikone Island?

220
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,700
Yes.

221
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,200
What was she like at that age?

222
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
What was she like?

223
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,000
Well, like an ordinary island girl.

224
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,100
I wasn't born on that island.

225
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,300
Really?

226
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,100
We moved there due to my father's work.

227
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,800
Building a holiday resort.

228
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,800
So I lived on Hikone for three years.

229
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,000
And so you had the fateful encounter with her.

230
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Well, yeah.

231
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,500
But it took some time.

232
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:11,000
At first, the islanders were on bad terms with the families of the developers from Tokyo.

233
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
I see.

234
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,100
Well, I was only an elementary school student.

235
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,000
We returned to Tokyo before I entered middle school,

236
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,600
so I don't know how things turned out.

237
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,800
[Say "No" to the holiday resort that will destroy Hikone Island!]

238
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,100
Then, where did you meet her again?

239
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,500
When I was a university student.

240
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,500
Right after she came to Tokyo I met her by chance.

241
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,000
At that time, Atsumi was still at the begin of her career as manga creator.

242
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,300
She was drawing manga all day long,

243
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,100
but couldn't sell anything of it.

244
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,000
Her enthusiasm was amazing.

245
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,000
I see.

246
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,000
Perhaps this is one of her works from that time.

247
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,300
Thank you.

248
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,300
Bye.

249
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,100
Just a side effect...

250
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,100
Koichi!

251
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,300
What brings you here so suddenly?

252
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,100
I'm looking for something.

253
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,500
Where is my stuff from elementary school times?

254
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,000
I really couldn't say straight away.

255
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,200
Miyauchi-san is not here, right?

256
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,100
Then I come in.
I'll look for it myself.

257
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,600
Hey, Koichi!

258
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,000
It's been a long time.
Shall I cook something for you?

259
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,300
No, it's okay.

260
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,400
I'll only take a quick look.

261
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Here you go.

262
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,200
This brings back memories!

263
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,100
When you used it, your father was still alive, right?

264
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,200
Don't worry.
I will go before Miyauchi-san comes home.

265
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,200
You don't have to leave.

266
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,900
It's not that he doesn't like you.

267
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,800
It's alright, I'll be done soon.

268
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,000
I see.
How's Atsumi-san doing?

269
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,800
- Not bad.
- So?

270
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,600
She might regain consciousness soon.

271
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,100
Ah, that's good news.

272
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:05,000
You see, I haven't told him about the incident with Atsumi yet.

273
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,000
He knows about her hospitalization, but

274
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,200
after all, suicide...
It would cause quite a discussion.

275
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,300
I got it.

276
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:23,800
And these odd mangas she made.
I never understood what it was about.

277
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,000
It's okay, don't worry about it.

278
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,100
Atsumi will soon regain consciousness.
Then you can visit her.

279
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,100
You're right.
I'll do that.

280
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,400
Atsumi...

281
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,700
Atsumi?

282
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,600
Welcome back.

283
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,000
Why are you sitting here?

284
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,000
I couldn't make any progress.

285
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,500
Say, Koichi, do you think I'm already burned-out?

286
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,100
Perhaps I'm finished already.

287
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,300
That's not true!

288
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,100
What about the plesiosaur drawing?

289
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,900
Sorry, I haven't found it yet.

290
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,100
So...

291
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,900
Anyway, let's get out of this room now.

292
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,400
Be careful, here's water everywhere.

293
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Thank you.

294
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,300
Do you want to go outside?

295
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,600
But I'm a little scared.

296
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,200
This is a sign that you're regaining consciousness.

297
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,400
You think so?

298
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,400
How is it?
Shall we try going out?

299
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,700
I'll go and take a look around.

300
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,100
There was nothing to see outside.

301
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,300
Perhaps we should better stay here.

302
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
So?

303
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,000
You're drawing manga again?

304
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,300
Atsumi, say,

305
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,300
shouldn't we have a serious talk about our future?

306
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,500
Koichi, isn't it time for your part-time work?

307
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,600
I've quit that job long ago.

308
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
When?

309
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,200
One year ago.

310
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
After you

311
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,400
had attempted suicide.

312
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
Atsumi,

313
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,300
in reality, you're unconscious since one year.

314
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,100
I know.

315
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,100
When you regain consciousness, there will be rehabilitation

316
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,000
and a lot of other things you'll have to undergo.

317
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:17,200
You should think about manga when you're fully recovered.

318
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,000
That's exactly why I'm continuing with drawing now.

319
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,400
Drawing here, what is it good for?

320
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,200
Why not?
It makes me happy.

321
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,500
Atsumi, you don't look happy at all!

322
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,000
You're constantly worried about the deadline,
isn't this only stressing!

323
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,300
It's because you haven't found my plesiosaur drawing.

324
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,900
What a nonsense is that!

325
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,000
Here we are inside of my mind.

326
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,400
Therefore, everything is possible here.

327
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,000
Fujita-san, are you alright?

328
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Yes.

329
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,800
The second session was a success.

330
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,700
It lasted for about two hours.
Everything went fine.

331
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,000
Did you notice any difference compared to the first contact?

332
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,300
When I left the apartment,

333
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,900
there was a thick fog and I couldn't see anything.

334
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,300
I wonder what's behind it.

335
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,000
I was afraid to go further.

336
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,800
That's probably the boundary of Atsumi-san's conscious mind.

337
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:11,000
She isn't aware of what's beyond that boundary.
I think it's her subconscious mind.

338
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,300
Anything else?

339
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,800
There was a person in the mansion hallway.

340
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,900
Someone you don't know?

341
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,400
A resident, I suppose.

342
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,100
He looked like a normal man, but he was no human being.

343
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,100
A philosophical zombie.

344
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,000
- Philosophical zombie?
- Yes.

345
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,300
Atsumi-san's mind creates them at will.

346
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,600
They have no substance, just an outward appearance.

347
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,000
They're a kind of symbol.
Take no notice of them.

348
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,000
Is this a final decision?

349
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,200
No, it's not like that,

350
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,700
but we can't put the series on hold for all eternity.

351
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,300
I see.

352
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,600
So let's declare "Roomi" finished for now,

353
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,000
and in case Kazu-kun wakes up, we start a new series.

354
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,400
Can't you wait for 3 month?

355
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,300
This may sound harsh,

356
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,800
but the readers also begin to ask questions.

357
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,600
They say perhaps she will never come back.

358
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,500
Excuse me,

359
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:02,000
how about we publish a special issue of "Roomi" out of sequence?

360
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:08,100
With this we could prove that Kazu-sensei is still alive and well.

361
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,200
And who will draw it?

362
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,500
That would be

363
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,500
her assistant, me.

364
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,700
You're a ghostwriter?

365
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,000
Well, it might work.

366
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,600
Alright.

367
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,600
If it helps to continue "Roomi", then I agree.

368
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,600
But please let me ask Atsumi first.

369
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,800
How could you ask her?

370
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,200
It may be possible.
I'll try.

371
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,000
So please wait with your decision for a little while.

372
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,700
Welcome home.

373
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,900
I'm back.

374
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,300
Today, I'm in good form.

375
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,400
I'm making good progress.

376
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,800
I see.

377
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,100
Atsumi, listen for a moment.

378
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,800
What is it?

379
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,400
Takagi-kun is going to draw a special issue of "Roomi".

380
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,900
He said it's in order to show the readers that you're alive and well.

381
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,300
What's that supposed to mean?

382
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,200
Sawano-san said Takagi-kun could do it.

383
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,900
Koichi,

384
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,200
why didn't you refuse?

385
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:05,500
I'm drawing day by day so that the series can be continued

386
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,300
as soon as I wake up from this coma!

387
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,300
I know.

388
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,700
That's why I beg you,

389
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,600
don't take my manga away from me.

390
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,800
I'm sorry.

391
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,500
It was stupid of me.

392
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,900
I'll tell them to forget it.

393
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,700
It's okay.

394
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,000
I knew it would happen some day,

395
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,000
so I'm prepared.

396
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I...

397
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,100
will never

398
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,300
wake up from this state, right?

399
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,500
Don't say such things!

400
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,000
I won't let this happen.

401
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,600
However,

402
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,400
today it went very well.

403
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,200
I properly observed the deadline.

404
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,000
Even Sawano-san and Takagi-kun might be surprised when they see this manuscript.

405
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,800
I guess it will change their view on me a little.

406
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,700
Here they are.

407
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,200
Who?

408
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
Coming!

409
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,200
Please come in.

410
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,000
The manuscript is finished.

411
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,200
It went very well,

412
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,000
especially the middle part.

413
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It's different from my former work, but I guess it's interesting.

414
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,900
Say, Sawano-san,

415
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,300
why do you let Takagi-kun draw a special issue?

416
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,000
And Takagi-kun,

417
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,700
didn't I always tell you not to imitate other's work?

418
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,800
Why did you volunteer to work as my ghostwriter?

419
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,600
You can't answer, can you?

420
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,400
I see.
Well, it doesn't matter.

421
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,800
But I made another sketch today that I want to show you.

422
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,600
You guys will never understand my manga.

423
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,500
This is me.

424
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,300
Don't forget it when you wake up.

425
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,200
Well, well, well, well...

426
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,400
The special issue will become a hit.

427
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,000
Really?

428
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,400
This will be Kazu Atsumi's spectacular resurrection!

429
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,700
Takagi-kun will make a second special too.

430
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:24,100
Well, if it turns out to be sparkling, 
it'll be the begin of a new series, right?

431
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,600
Is that true, Takagi-kun?

432
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,400
Well... yes.

433
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,200
Congratulations.

434
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,500
Thanks.

435
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,700
This character is good.

436
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,400
She could become the heroine of the new series.

437
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,400
How can I get it off?

438
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,000
Is it you, Fujita-san?

439
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,300
I'm Aihara from the Medical Center.

440
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,800
It seems Atsumi-san wants to contact you.

441
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,400
Can you come here immediately?

442
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,200
We've been waiting for you.

443
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:08,300
This is the first time we see a request for contact coming from a patient's brain.

444
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:09,600
What could this mean?

445
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,400
It may be a symptom of some new development.

446
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,800
Is it a sign that Atsumi will regain consciousness?

447
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,300
That could be possible.

448
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,300
Atsumi!

449
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,800
What happened?

450
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,800
Koichi,

451
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,100
I've been waiting for you so long.

452
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,200
Here?

453
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,200
- I want to get out of here!
- Atsumi!

454
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,200
- What should I do?
- Calm down!

455
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,100
This is the world inside of your mind,

456
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:04,500
so if you calm down and resume your everyday life,
this world will turn back to normal too.

457
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,200
No...
I don't want to resume that life!

458
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,500
Do you really think so?

459
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:24,500
I can't remember any time when I wasn't drawing manga.

460
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,200
Even though there must have been a lot of things I enjoyed.

461
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,300
It's as if I had lost myself.

462
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:38,000
Tell me, Koichi, who am I?

463
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,400
I understand.
Then, let's get out of here.

464
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,500
We'll go as far as we can.

465
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,500
What might be beyond this point?

466
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,200
I don't know.

467
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,700
These are philosophical zombies.

468
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,800
Philosophical zombies?

469
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,000
Don't worry, they're harmless.

470
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,400
Beyond this point begins my subconscious mind?

471
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,400
Yeah.
Probably.

472
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,000
Here is the boundary.

473
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,600
I'll try to take a look.

474
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,300
Where are we here?

475
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,200
It's Hikone Island!

476
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,000
Hikone Island?

477
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,900
We're back where we've been 15 years ago!

478
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,100
So this is the island from my elementary school times?

479
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,500
This wakes memories!

480
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,900
Look at that mountain!

481
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,600
We often climbed it with our classmates, didn't we?

482
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,400
There!
Look! My home.

483
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,800
I'm back!

484
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:38,400
[Say "No" to the holiday resort that will destroy Hikone Island!]

485
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,700
Atsumi?

486
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,000
Atsumi?

487
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:22,400
Look, my father, my mother, and my big sister.

488
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,200
Koichi, won't you eat with us?

489
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,500
Atsumi, let's go!

490
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,700
This isn't real!

491
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,000
It's all an illusion.

492
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,700
This place...

493
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,200
What is this here?

494
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I remember this place!

495
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:19,000
That can't be, Atsumi.
This is not real.

496
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,700
This place never existed.

497
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,100
You again!?

498
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:08,600
Atsumi-san got in a state of shock so we terminated the session.

499
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,000
Kazu-san!
Kazu-san, can you hear me?

500
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,100
Kazu-san!

501
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,000
How's Atsumi?

502
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,200
Her brainwaves show wild swings.

503
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,500
That's all we know about her condition at the moment.

504
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,700
- Hiraoka, breathing mask!
- Yes!

505
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:22,200
Can you save her?

506
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,000
Here's the bag!

507
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,800
I don't think her life is in danger.

508
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:30,800
Kazu-san!
Kazu-san, can you hear me?

509
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,700
Atsumi-san's condition is stable now.

510
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,600
Really?
Thank God.

511
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,600
What happened in her subconscious mind?

512
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,500
We left the apartment.

513
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,700
At the end of the road there was a wall of thick fog.

514
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,200
Beyond it we found ourselves on Hikone Island.

515
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:29,400
The place of your childhood?

516
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,000
Then,

517
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,800
we met Atsumi's family in their home.

518
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:43,000
And suddenly we came to another place.

519
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,100
A young boy emerged from the sea.

520
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:50,300
A boy?

521
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,000
I don't know who he is.

522
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:59,200
But he already appeared several times in my hallucinations.

523
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,100
I thought it was a side effect of these sessions.

524
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,300
I see.

525
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,000
What should I do now?

526
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,100
Why do you ask?

527
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,400
Should I go back to the island?

528
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,000
If that's what you want to do.

529
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,100
Excuse me!

530
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:41,500
Uhm...

531
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,200
Well,

532
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,500
who are you?

533
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:50,700
I'm Fujita.

534
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,600
You're Atsumi's father, right?

535
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,700
So it's you.

536
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,700
Long time no see.

537
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:06,600
What do you want?

538
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,700
I only wanted to see the island again after all that time.

539
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:18,800
Atsumi's condition hasn't changed.

540
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,400
I see.

541
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,000
Let me help you.

542
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:54,200
I had never thought this place would become like this.

543
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,600
Then, what did you expect to see?

544
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,700
The desired dream resort?

545
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:03,100
No.

546
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,800
You just didn't want to think about it.

547
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:17,000
Even an elementary student must have known that what your father did was not right.

548
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,000
On top of that,

549
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:23,700
in these 15 years since you left the island you didn't return a single time.

550
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:31,000
You were afraid to see what had become of the island.

551
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,600
Of course, I'm just as guilty.

552
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:54,200
At that time, I silently watched the island becoming like this.

553
01:07:55,800 --> 01:08:00,100
As a punishment, I stayed here these 15 years.

554
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,000
But you run away.

555
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:14,900
And I bet somewhere else you made the same mistake again.

556
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:16,600
That's not true.

557
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:24,900
I'm sure my father also didn't think it would become like this.

558
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,900
Then bring him here to see it.

559
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,800
My father is dead.

560
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:35,300
He died of overwork.

561
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,600
It was an act of divine punishment.

562
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:43,400
My father was also a victim.

563
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:47,500
He only followed the company's orders.

564
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,600
Then, who is to blame?

565
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,600
Who should take the responsibility for this?

566
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,700
Thanks for waiting.

567
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:01,900
Atsumi?

568
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,700
Are you Atsumi?

569
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,200
Atsumi...

570
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,000
Stay away from there!

571
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,700
[ Hikone Police Headquarters ]

572
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,700
A case from 15 years ago?

573
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:06,400
Yes, some sort of case

574
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,200
or an accident.

575
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,400
One moment please.

576
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,900
There was a missing person report.

577
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,100
Who was reported missing?

578
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,100
Please wait a second.

579
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:41,000
Could it be

580
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:44,800
it was a boy?

581
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,200
A boy?

582
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:49,800
No idea.

583
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:36,400
There it is!

584
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,600
How was your trip to the island?

585
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:15,000
I found an old sketchbook.

586
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,700
So you found the plesiosaur drawing.

587
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:20,700
Yes.

588
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:24,600
But it was in a bad condition and hardly to recognize.

589
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:30,400
With this, one of the matters you had on your mind is settled, isn't it?

590
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:31,800
Yes.

591
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:39,100
Hey!

592
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,600
Atsumi, listen carefully.

593
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:48,300
I found the plesiosaur drawing.

594
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,500
The plesiosaur?

595
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,700
I returned to the island and found it at last.

596
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:57,800
But the drawing is in a very bad condition.
I could hardly see what it was.

597
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,100
I see.

598
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,800
And then, I had an idea.

599
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,000
At that place, it might still be like it was 15 years ago.

600
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:16,000
Do you remember our secret place in the forest?

601
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:21,300
You know, the place where we hid our precious items.

602
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,400
A secret place?

603
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,700
Remember!

604
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:27,100
That's just not possible!

605
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,600
I'm sure it was this sketchbook!

606
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,300
You drew the plesiosaur into it!

607
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,300
Koichi!

608
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,800
Forget it.

609
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,400
But...

610
01:16:56,600 --> 01:16:58,600
This dream that I had

611
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,900
is over now.

612
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,500
Then,

613
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,500
are you going to wake up?

614
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,100
It'll become again like it was before, right?

615
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,000
It's not like this?

616
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,300
Atsumi?

617
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:37,200
Atsumi?

618
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:52,100
Don't go away!

619
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,100
Don't tell me you...

620
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,500
Such a thing...

621
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:03,000
That's impossible.
That's completely impossible!

622
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,300
You are Atsumi.

623
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,700
You are the real Atsumi!

624
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,600
That's why I all the time...

625
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:55,700
Atsumi?

626
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,500
Finally we meet, right?

627
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:10,400
The plesiosaur?

628
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:13,800
Yeah.

629
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,600
It's perfect, isn't it?

630
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,600
Koichi,

631
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:23,400
you said you were so stressed and couldn't draw it.

632
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,800
But now you're alright again, aren't you?

633
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,000
I was the manga creator?

634
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:37,000
Of course.
Are you surprised?

635
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:40,000
I thought it was the other way around.

636
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,000
Koichi, you are

637
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
now

638
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,000
lying in a hospital bed.

639
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:54,400
In a coma?

640
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:56,900
Yes.

641
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,700
So actually you are contacting me?

642
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,400
I see.

643
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,600
But why?

644
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,400
Koichi,

645
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:20,100
at that time, you had some trouble with your work.

646
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:25,000
It was one year ago, do you remember?

647
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:27,200
One year ago?

648
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,400
Now I remember.

649
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,700
The series didn't work well at all.

650
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,500
I was very troubled.

651
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,700
I was drunk and walked on the river bank.

652
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:05,400
A long time before, you had made a pendant for me.

653
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,400
I had lost it,

654
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:09,400
and was always upset about that.

655
01:25:10,300 --> 01:25:13,600
Then I saw something that resembled it,

656
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:18,000
but when I streched out my arm to grab it,

657
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,600
I slipped.

658
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:30,600
Stupid, wasn't it?

659
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:36,100
So it wasn't suicide!

660
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,600
I would never do such a thing.

661
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:44,400
I'm glad to hear that.

662
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:48,000
I thought it was you who were in a coma.

663
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,900
And I did what I could

664
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,500
to make you wake up.

665
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:03,400
So it was all an illusion!

666
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,000
But I'm happy

667
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,700
that you are doing well.

668
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:22,000
I've known what you were feeling, Koichi.

669
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:27,200
When I was with you, your feelings always reached me.

670
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,300
It happened spontaneously.

671
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:31,700
That's why I won't give up!

672
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:34,000
I will see you again!

673
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,900
I'm firmly convinced of that.

674
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:40,600
Really?

675
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,500
Then it wasn't in vain.

676
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:15,700
Are you crying?

677
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:22,000
You know, Koichi,

678
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,200
you haven't changed a bit.

679
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,500
Of course not.

680
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,500
I am as I am.

681
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:42,400
I'm so happy to see you again.

682
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,700
Honestly, how is my condition?

683
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,100
Is it serious?

684
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I see.

685
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:16,800
There's not much time left.

686
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,300
You'll recover for sure!

687
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,000
I know it!

688
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:38,900
I still have a lot of manga to draw.

689
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,200
[ Have you forgotten me? ]

690
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:55,300
What happened?

691
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:59,100
I'm terribly scared.
I wonder why?

692
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,300
What are you afraid of?

693
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:03,400
I don't know!

694
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,600
It's alright!
Don't be afraid!

695
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:13,400
I'll always be with you!

696
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:14,900
Atsumi...

697
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,600
I don't want you to leave me.

698
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,500
Kazu-san, can you hear me?

699
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:36,500
You're in the Medical Center.

700
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:39,000
The appointed one hour is over.

701
01:29:44,700 --> 01:29:46,900
Did you meet Fujita-san?

702
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:50,500
Yes.

703
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,200
I met him at home.

704
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:58,700
We could talk about various things.

705
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:01,000
It was a success!

706
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:04,500
Free her.

707
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,600
Aihara-sensei!

708
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:29,600
Kazu-san, you're free to go.

709
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,700
- Yonemura-sensei, his heart rate and blood pressure...
- One moment!

710
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:52,000
Kazu-san, please take a rest.
We'll handle everything else.

711
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:54,100
Excuse me...

712
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:58,800
His mind is still completely clear.

713
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,600
Yes, but

714
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,300
it's his physical condition.

715
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,500
- Get ready!
- Yes.

716
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:11,000
I was together with him until a moment ago.

717
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:16,600
I can still feel holding him in my arms!

718
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:17,800
I understand your feelings, but...

719
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:20,300
Sensei, blood pressure dropped to 40.

720
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:22,500
- Vasopressor, immediately!
- Yes!

721
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,900
Please wait a moment!

722
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:32,500
There are still things I have to talk about with Koichi.

723
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:37,200
His work, our life, and what he's afraid of!

724
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,200
Atsumi-san,

725
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,200
please trust in us.

726
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:45,200
We'll bring him through this crisis for sure.

727
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:57,200
Koichi believed in his mind that I would be in a coma.

728
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
It seems he desperately tried to make me awake.

729
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:03,300
So that's how it was.

730
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:09,900
Why did he swap our positions?

731
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:17,600
In the past year, Fujita-san was many times connected to the interface.

732
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:22,500
Although he's in a coma, he probably understood what was going on.

733
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:28,600
Then he realized that you were always closely surrounded by me and the medical team

734
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:35,000
and came to the conclusion that you were in a coma
and he's the one who was trying to establish contact.

735
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,000
Was this

736
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,800
the last time?

737
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:48,300
No.

738
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:52,700
Finally he had contact to your true self.

739
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:58,500
He must have a strong wish to see you again now.

740
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:04,000
This wish is so strong that he will survive.

741
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,900
I believe you, Sensei.

742
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:54,000
Sawano-san, is it you?
Here's Kazu.

743
01:33:55,500 --> 01:34:00,000
I found yet another unpublished manuscript of Koichi.

744
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:02,600
Yes.

745
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:06,100
No, I'll take it to you.

746
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,200
Yes, no problem.

747
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,200
I see...

748
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,500
This is good.

749
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:31,400
Although it is an early work, it has a resemblance to "Roomi", hasn't it?

750
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:34,700
That's true.
The Morio who appears here

751
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:37,900
is almost like the character who appears in "Roomi", right?

752
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:39,700
And they both have the same name.

753
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:45,400
I guess Fujita-sensei wanted to make this guy the killer in the series.

754
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:46,800
Morio?

755
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,200
That young boy... the one in a swimsuit.

756
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:55,400
Speaking of it,

757
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:59,600
when Fujita-sensei was drawing that character,

758
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:03,600
he seemed somehow changed.

759
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:04,800
What do you mean?

760
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,700
As if he was scared of something.

761
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:12,200
Is that so?

762
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:17,000
No, not to my knowledge.

763
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:19,500
I see.

764
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:21,600
Sorry.

765
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Anyway, with this, Fujita Koichi's unpublished works are complete.

766
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,600
His fans will be happy.

767
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,700
Sawano-san, here's the test print.

768
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,200
From what?

769
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:37,200
The Fujita Koichi feature story.

770
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:39,900
Oi, oi, oi, oi...

771
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:44,400
Don't bring such things here now!

772
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,400
I'm sorry.

773
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:52,500
Well, of course I know that it's too early for this.

774
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:58,300
But it's our job as publisher to be prepared to act quickly when the time comes.

775
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:03,100
Well, no matter how you look at it, it's too early, right?

776
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:08,400
Alright.
Let's cancel this feature story.

777
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:10,400
Please forget it.

778
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,100
In case something happens,

779
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
I will inform you immediately.

780
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:25,900
I'm very sorry,

781
01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:29,600
but please lock this test print away.

782
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:31,200
Okay.

783
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,500
Excuse me now.

784
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:39,300
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

785
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:05,000
- Now I see!
- What do you mean?

786
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:08,800
If you permute the letters of the word "Roomi",

787
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:27,600
it becomes "Morio".
It's an anagram.

788
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,500
So the boy Morio is indeed the killer.

789
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:37,500
Fujita-kun gave a nice little hint.

790
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:04,900
Good evening.

791
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Fujita-san,

792
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:11,900
can you hear me?

793
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,500
It's me, Aihara.

794
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,600
Today, well,

795
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:31,300
let's talk about Atsumi-san.

796
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:38,100
Finally, you met the real Atsumi-san, didn't you?

797
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:42,400
It must have brought back memories.

798
01:38:45,200 --> 01:38:46,800
How was it?

799
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:48,600
Atsumi-san,

800
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:52,900
hasn't she changed in that year?

801
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:03,600
Is there anything you want to say?

802
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,900
Try to say it again.

803
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:20,100
Fu... ne... (ship)

804
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:23,000
Did you say "ship"?

805
01:39:25,900 --> 01:39:28,200
Do you see a ship?

806
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:34,300
What will you do?

807
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:38,200
Do you board this ship?

808
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:47,700
It's alright.
Please get on board.

809
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:54,600
Do you see anyone else on board?

810
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:03,100
Who is it?

811
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:10,900
Who's that other person?

812
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:18,700
No! 
Get off immediately!

813
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:26,000
You mustn't get on that ship yet.

814
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,400
Get off at once.

815
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:31,500
Quickly!

816
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:40,000
Vital parameters?

817
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:42,100
Heart rate 40-50.

818
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:44,200
His heart is coming to it's limits.

819
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:46,000
- I'll fetch another blanket.
- Okay.

820
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:51,800
Excuse me.

821
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:55,400
Can I get connected to him now?

822
01:40:56,700 --> 01:40:59,500
Please let me make contact with him!

823
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:02,200
That's impossible.

824
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:05,000
His EEG is almost flat.

825
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,600
He's as good as braindead.

826
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:09,100
But he's still alive!

827
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:11,700
I wonder about that.

828
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:14,900
Look at this!

829
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:21,800
Is this a sign?

830
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,600
Maybe Koichi wants me to contact him.

831
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:32,700
There must be something he wants to tell me.

832
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:34,600
Please!

833
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:39,800
Sensei,

834
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:42,700
let's give it a try.

835
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:51,100
- Take him to the session room.
- Yes.

836
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:52,900
- Oxygen supply?
- 3 liter.

837
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:54,500
- Then, increase to 4 liter.
- Yes.

838
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:00,700
Ready?
One, two, three...

839
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:22,400
Please remember, 30 minutes is the limit.

840
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:25,400
Understood.

841
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:27,600
It's done.

842
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:33,600
I'm ready.

843
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:49,400
This?

844
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,300
Morio?

845
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:27,000
Morio!
You are Morio, right?

846
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:32,400
It's you, right?
Who's still going around in Koichi's mind.

847
01:44:33,300 --> 01:44:34,400
Atsumi?

848
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,100
Koichi!

849
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:42,800
Look, there's Morio.
We were classmates.

850
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:48,300
Morio?

851
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:55,000
Now I remember!

852
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,100
That guy

853
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:07,000
was always hostile to me because I came from Tokyo.

854
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:11,800
Yes.

855
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:18,000
He probably couldn't forgive that we became friends.

856
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,400
Oi, Morio!

857
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:26,100
Oi!

858
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:35,200
At that time, all the boys on the island

859
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:40,300
competed with each other to reach that red flag.

860
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:50,200
Koichi, watch out!

861
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:52,200
Stop it!

862
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,000
Oi, stop it now!

863
01:45:57,300 --> 01:45:58,300
Stop it!

864
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:01,400
Leave me!

865
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:03,300
Stop it! Both of you!

866
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:04,300
Koichi!

867
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:12,000
Koichi, I'll help you!

868
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:14,800
Stop it!

869
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:17,800
Atsumi!

870
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:20,200
Atsumi!

871
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:36,000
I'm alright, Atsumi.

872
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Koichi!

873
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:58,300
At that time when Morio drowned,

874
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:02,900
there was nothing we could have done.

875
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:08,000
The only thing we did

876
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:12,000
was drawing the picture of a plesiosaur.

877
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:15,500
We put all the blame on this plesiosaur

878
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,500
and locked it up in the safebox.

879
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:35,500
That's right.

880
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:43,500
Look at this.
It's the pendant I gave you.

881
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:48,900
There it is!

882
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:53,000
This is it!

883
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:10,600
Right.

884
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:14,600
If you hold it this way, it looks a little like a plesiosaur.

885
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,200
A perfect resemblance, isn't it?

886
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:22,300
Now everything is alright.

887
01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:26,400
Finally, my heart feels relieved.

888
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:31,000
Atsumi, thank you.

889
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:34,700
It's thanks to you.

890
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:43,700
Koichi?

891
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:49,300
Koichi, where are you?

892
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:52,700
No!
You mustn't go!

893
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:56,300
Don't go away!

894
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:19,500
14:30 - cardiac arrest.

895
01:49:20,100 --> 01:49:22,100
I'll confirm death.

896
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:34,500
Atsumi-san, are you alright?

897
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,800
You've done what you could.

898
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:39,000
- One more time please!
- But...

899
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,600
Once more, right now!

900
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:43,000
I'm sorry, nothing can be done anymore.

901
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,500
I'll bring him back!

902
01:49:44,500 --> 01:49:47,000
There's still time!
Hurry up!

903
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:54,700
We'll do it again.

904
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,800
- Sasaki-san, do the preparation.
- Yes!

905
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:32,800
Koichi!

906
01:51:07,300 --> 01:51:08,400
Atsumi?

907
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:15,600
Morio,

908
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:19,100
I'm sorry, but I have to go back.

909
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:52,700
Koichi...

910
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:54,900
I've come back.

911
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:12,700
That's not true!

912
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Breathing has restarted.

913
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:35,800
He's coming back.

914
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,100
Sanada-kun!

915
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:47,400
- The mask.
- Yes!

916
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,700
Atsumi-san, you've done it!

917
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:10,300
Out of the way, Morio!
Don't molest us!

918
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:14,100
I'm not coming yet.
Go alone!

919
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:21,300
I'm sorry that I forgot what happened to you.

920
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:29,000
You're wrong!
Koichi didn't forget you!

921
01:54:29,700 --> 01:54:32,400
He's always been suffering because of you!

922
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:32,100
Koichi, where are we here?

923
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:51,600
What we did is indeed irreparable.

924
01:55:55,100 --> 01:55:57,600
This is the striking proof.

925
01:55:58,900 --> 01:56:02,300
Forget this here!
This isn't reality!

926
01:56:02,300 --> 01:56:05,500
Don't take it for real, then everything will be again as it was!

927
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:08,900
Yeah, let's go.

928
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:13,300
Let's get away from here and go home.

929
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:46,200
We can't get away,

930
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,200
no matter what we do.

931
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:53,000
Seems our sins really can't be forgiven.

932
01:58:36,700 --> 01:58:37,700
Atsumi!

933
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:50,600
Koichi!

934
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:08,600
Koichi!

935
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:44,200
Morio!

936
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:47,500
This is what you want, right!

937
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:51,500
Okay, I give it to you!

938
01:59:51,700 --> 01:59:53,200
As a present from me!

939
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:56,800
And then you leave us alone, okay!

940
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:05,300
Come on!
Hurry up and take it!

941
02:00:06,600 --> 02:00:07,700
Otherwise...

942
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:45,100
Koichi!
Koichi!

943
02:00:54,200 --> 02:00:55,300
Atsumi...

944
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:02,800
I'm so glad!

945
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:47,500
I wonder what's the reason.

946
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:55,600
Since the day I was born,

947
02:01:58,200 --> 02:02:01,900
I felt your presence in my mind.

948
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:10,900
And so it will always be.
