1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,549
<i>Under Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq,</i>

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,874
<i>every family</i>

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,797
<i>that named its newborn son</i>

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,672
<i>after the ruler,</i>

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,028
<i>was generously rewarded.</i>

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,474
<i>This movie</i>

7
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,477
<i>is based on a true story.</i>

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,079
Is the bread ready?

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,676
Come on, soldier!
Let's load the food.

10
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
So?

11
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,273
Did they knock him down?

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,959
They're doing it right now.

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,959
Bring him down!

14
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,159
Bring him down!

15
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,675
We have to go.

16
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,392
I'm coming.

17
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
That's enough.

18
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,872
Come on... we have to go.

19
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,231
Shouldn't we be happy

20
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,998
that they knocked down Saddam?

21
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,957
<i>Her house is high up...</i>

22
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
<i>Ley... LEW-</i>

23
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,358
Don't you wanna tell me, when

24
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,674
you'll get married?

25
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,715
Not before I find my brother.

26
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,239
He's probably in prison...

27
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,032
As soon as they open the prisons,

28
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,229
they'll release him.

29
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,635
By the grace of God
he shall come back home.

30
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,119
I hope so.

31
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,836
He's 25 years old now.

32
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,071
Seven years younger than me.

33
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,516
He's the meaning of my life...

34
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,076
and my mom won't stop crying.

35
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320
This one.

36
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,996
He's the shadow of my rose.

37
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Thank you, sir.

38
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,789
You're welcome.

39
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,194
Thas's the last time

40
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,833
I'm driving this scrap.

41
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,190
The Americans have already come

42
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,436
and they are bringing us new cars.

43
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,676
God only knows... hopefully.

44
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,836
- Do you have enough fuel?
- Yes, sure.

45
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,189
How much does it cost?

46
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,639
70 dinnars for one gallon.

47
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,830
Isn't it too expensive?
What can we do?

48
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
That's the price!

49
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,399
Well, pour one gallon.

50
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,839
Bring it here, Ahmed.

51
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
Yes, father!

52
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,469
Damn, you scoundrel!

53
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,113
I missed it because of you!

54
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,389
You poured the fuel

55
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,839
on the ground!

56
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,990
Didn't I pay for it?

57
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,633
Grab the fuel, you idiot.

58
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,239
They came...

59
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,948
They came!

60
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
Well done.

61
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,513
Haven't you finished?

62
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,789
It's ready, brother.

63
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,478
Do you see how good my English is?

64
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Like a nightingale!

65
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,870
Yes, yes, it's true my brother.

66
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,274
Life will get better,
now that the Americans are here.

67
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,392
You'll get gasoline and oil
in a tank instead of a gallon.

68
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,715
And at home you can do nothing
but eat and sleep.

69
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,990
Come on...
why are you talking to him like this?

70
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,950
It sounds nice...

71
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,991
I'm not happy yet.
The dictator Saddam

72
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,473
has not been brought down yet.

73
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,794
The arabs will pull off,

74
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,990
but they'll plunder our oil and gasoline.

75
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,314
It's not as you say.

76
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
Come on, come on.

77
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,199
I'm telling you,
it will slip out of our hand

78
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,356
and get lost in front of our door.

79
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,391
Look, can you see that scrap?

80
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,069
They deserved even worse!

81
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Now come,

82
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,511
and look at these cannon wreckages.

83
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,718
See those tanks cannon.

84
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,070
Looks as if it was gonna fire right away.

85
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,838
Why don't you fire now?

86
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,592
Something's still missing,

87
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,318
that I cannot grab with this
or the other hand.

88
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,477
I'm ready to die soon,
if Saddam gets his comeuppance.

89
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,352
Anything he could ever go through

90
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,595
wouldn't be as bad

91
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,438
as what he's done to our village!

92
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,911
Hurry up, go faster!

93
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
It's too late.

94
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,952
I'll fly now.

95
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,671
You should have become a musician,

96
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,109
not a Peshmerga
(iraqi-kurdish activist).

97
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,309
Aren't you happy that

98
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,953
I'm fighting as a Peshmerga

99
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,399
against Saddam?

100
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,956
They were Saddam's troop of murderers!

101
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
That's true!

102
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,953
<i>Safm... Safm... Gareh.</i>

103
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
Yeah, yeah...

104
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
<i>Where are you?</i>

105
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,917
In zone 22, we should be there

106
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,519
in an hour.

107
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,193
<i>Very well, understood.</i>

108
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,195
Fine and over.

109
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,076
According to that sound you can tell

110
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,474
they must be starving.

111
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,997
Be careful... slowly.

112
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,999
Where did he come from?

113
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,673
What are you doing here?

114
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,153
Go home... go home!

115
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,598
Do you see how dark he is?

116
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,869
So dark that you can't

117
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,035
see him at night.

118
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Go home!

119
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,879
Why did you stop the car?

120
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,718
I'm worried about this kid.

121
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,839
This dirty kid?

122
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,359
Come on, let's get moving.

123
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,754
We have to do something

124
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,029
before we go on.

125
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,160
You know, the group

126
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,793
is waiting for us, my brother.

127
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,595
Why are you crying?

128
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,233
Why are you barefooted,

129
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
without any shoes?

130
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,189
Home? Family?

131
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,759
Where is your home?

132
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,792
Come on, I don't speak Arabic...

133
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,478
Please ask him in Arabic.

134
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,158
Come along, it's getting late.

135
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,918
This kid is lost.

136
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,189
Leave this dirty,

137
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,673
filthy creature.

138
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,519
Don't you know
how dangerous this area is?

139
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,359
I'll ask in the houses.

140
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,708
Maybe someone knows him!

141
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,990
Let's go, forget about him.
We have to go!

142
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,039
I'll ask around to find his house.

143
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,268
Come on, my boy.

144
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,873
Which one of these houses

145
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
i5 yours?

146
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,513
Which is your house?

147
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,839
Is this your home?

148
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,394
How are you?

149
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
What do you want?

150
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,275
Is he your kid?

151
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,630
I don't understand what you're saying.

152
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,876
We've found this kid on the street.

153
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,877
Which family does he belong to?

154
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,353
I don't understand.

155
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,198
Kid... Kid... (Arabic)

156
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,754
Father, there's a stranger at the door.

157
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
What do you want?

158
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,838
This kid is lost.

159
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Do you know him?

160
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,073
Do you know this kid?

161
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,272
Why is it no one knows him.
Has he been living under a rock.

162
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,950
Hello, do you know this boy?

163
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,997
Strange, nobody seems to know him.

164
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,712
He certainly doesn't belong here.

165
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,909
Where is your gun?

166
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,799
I left it inside the car.

167
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,717
You're not an elderly person.

168
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,159
Ask him in Arabic

169
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,271
where his home is, and about his name.

170
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
What's your name?

171
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,554
What's your name?

172
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
Saddam!

173
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,518
What did you say your name was?

174
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
Saddam!

175
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,520
Saddam?!

176
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,836
Yay, I arrested Saddam!

177
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,599
You can't be him,

178
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,319
sondern der Schwarze!

179
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,319
What are you laughing at?

180
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,555
Actually, he looks

181
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,680
just like him.

182
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Open the door.

183
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,593
- Why?
- We'll deliver him to the Americans,

184
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,869
and then we'll leave.

185
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,752
Leave this dirty dog here.

186
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,155
I feel so sorry for him. It's a sin.

187
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,429
You feel sorry? A sin?

188
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,993
And what about ourselves?

189
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,675
Have you forgotten the Enfal operation?

190
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,068
Where is your brother?

191
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,188
But he's only a kid.

192
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,356
He knows nothing of these operations.

193
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,072
Open the door to let him in.

194
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
I swear to God, he's

195
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,639
not getting in the car, ok?

196
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,399
He'll only be sitting next to you,
he won't bite!

197
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,633
Drop him on the back seat.

198
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
In the back!

199
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
Come on.

200
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,909
Once Saddam is gone,

201
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,634
you can get yourself a passport
and go abroad.

202
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,194
You can even buy
an artificial leg.

203
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,753
And get an elastic one,

204
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,235
then you can jump as high
as a kangaroo.

205
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,435
I'm hungry... Food... Food.

206
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,040
What is he saying?

207
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,877
Stop somewhere...

208
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,560
He'll break the bowls and make them dirty.

209
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,796
Poor kid, that place is uncomfortable.

210
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,195
Even a dog couldn't sit there.

211
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,957
Come on down. Jump down.

212
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,080
Jump down!

213
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,236
What is he saying?

214
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,873
He's saying that he's hungry.

215
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,672
Let him eat a deadly poison!

216
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,438
I'll give him some rice with sauce.

217
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,835
If you're hungry,
you can have some, too.

218
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,995
You're horrible.

219
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,873
Which one do you want?

220
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,116
This one or that one?

221
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,639
Come on, eat, eat well.

222
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,440
Is that alright?

223
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,520
Come on, Blacky.

224
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,317
Why did you bring him over here?

225
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,589
I feel sorry for the kid...

226
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,472
Do you think he's going to eat you?

227
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,079
He's dirty and he stinks.

228
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,150
Poor kid, what do you want?

229
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,838
Hurry up, let's get away.

230
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,074
Water, water.

231
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,271
Give him some water.

232
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,232
He's choking.

233
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,994
My God, what kind of man are you?

234
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,792
Drink Blacky, drink.

235
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Bastard.

236
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,793
Easy man, what do you want?

237
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,512
The way you slapped this kid

238
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,392
you could even kill me.

239
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,636
Next time I can kill him.

240
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,636
Don't cry, don't cry...

241
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
Look...

242
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,953
Come, play something.

243
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,315
<i>Safm... Safm...</i>

244
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,198
Gareh... Safin... Yes, yes.

245
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,320
<i>Go to five.</i>

246
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Ok.

247
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,480
<i>What's going on?</i>

248
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,516
<i>Why haven't you arrived yet?</i>

249
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,110
We have a small problem, but it's ok.

250
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,913
We'll see you soon.

251
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,119
<i>What problem?</i>

252
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,870
Nothing, we'll tell you later.

253
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,075
<i>0k, 0k. Come soon...</i>

254
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,518
Alright, we'll see you.

255
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
My stomach...

256
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,679
Oh, my stomach.

257
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
Enough!

258
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,398
Stop somewhere. This kid

259
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,158
will make us dirty.

260
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,920
Hurry UP,

261
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,840
go over there.

262
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,712
I told you a hundred times

263
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,273
to take care of the child.

264
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,710
Let's look for him over here.
Maybe we'll find him.

265
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,840
I told you

266
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,955
to look after him.

267
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,229
In the midst of that war,

268
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,032
who was not out of his senses?

269
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,559
Hello sir, have you seen

270
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,432
a small, slender boy?

271
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,073
- No, I haven't.
- Thank you.

272
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,316
I blame you for all of this,
for God's sake.

273
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,276
I'll take him to the Americans.

274
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,753
Go ahead, take him.

275
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,868
Ok, you'll come along.

276
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,150
I don't speak English, you take him.

277
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,280
You'll come too.

278
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,157
I'm not coming.

279
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
Come on, Blacky.

280
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,708
We have a company.

281
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,433
Who the hell are they?

282
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Come here.

283
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,679
They are Peshmerga...

284
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
Hello, how are you?

285
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,390
- I'm a Peshmerga.
- Nice to meet you.

286
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,195
This is a child.

287
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,280
Yes, a little boy.

288
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,197
The boy got lost.

289
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,833
We found him.

290
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,788
Take him with you,

291
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,589
if possible!

292
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,559
I don't understand him.

293
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,797
I think he wants us to take the boy.

294
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,638
Do you want us to take the boy?

295
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,193
Yes, yes, you keep him.

296
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,398
<i>Safm... Safm... Gareh...</i>

297
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yes, Gareh.

298
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,953
<i>Where the heH are you?</i>

299
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,593
We faced a problem.

300
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,470
We found an Arab boy.

301
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,635
<i>What are you doing</i>

302
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,671
<i>with an Arab boy?</i>

303
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,518
Nothing... Nothing, but...

304
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,640
<i>Do hurry UP!</i>

305
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
Alright, alright.

306
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,555
So what happened?

307
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,432
The Americans refused to keep him.

308
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,198
You know, they called again.

309
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,548
They're not happy over there.

310
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,749
Leave him, let's go.

311
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,313
He only makes trouble.

312
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,877
Which way shall we go?

313
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,831
Which way shall we go?

314
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,469
I don't know, we're lost.

315
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,920
Give it to me!

316
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,633
That's not a toy!

317
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,156
Leave him, just tell me which way to go.

318
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,633
I swear to God...

319
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,228
I should kill you with one strike.

320
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,191
We should take this direction.

321
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,192
Excuse me, sir.

322
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,594
Have you seen a small,

323
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
slim boy around?

324
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,234
My son is five, he's called Saddam.

325
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,234
I told you a hundred times
not to mention

326
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,429
his name in public.

327
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,755
You're guilty of
naming my son Saddam.

328
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,279
You just wanted to be rewarded.

329
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,628
The reward was great pain,

330
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,909
torture... and a dead arm.

331
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,473
There are great names such as.

332
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,352
Abdula, Hassan, Hussain, Mohammad.

333
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,198
But no... you chose <<Saddam>>!

334
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,390
A name that nowadays
brings us many troubles...

335
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,556
and that we cannot
pronounce everywhere.

336
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,999
What kind of life do we have?

337
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,031
What a damn homeland to live in.

338
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,439
Why did you stop the car?

339
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,913
I'll take him to the mosque.

340
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,359
Let's go... It's late.

341
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
We'll only have a look.

342
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,068
Just leave him there and then we'll go.

343
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
The door is open...

344
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,395
there must be someone.

345
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,635
No one is in there.

346
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,120
Come on,

347
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,709
It'5 go!

348
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,798
I'm not coming, go by yourself.

349
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,194
I don't speak Arabic.

350
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,594
What should I say?

351
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,551
It's too dangerous for us here.

352
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,716
No, nothing's gonna happen.

353
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,431
There's someone in the Mosque.

354
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,714
Good day in God's name, Master!

355
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,440
Master,

356
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,600
this kid

357
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,591
is lost (Arabic).

358
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,078
Please announce that, so that

359
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,315
his parents can come.

360
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
Master,

361
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,398
announce it through the speakers,

362
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,034
in order to

363
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,957
find his parents (Arabic).

364
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,279
What speakers, and with

365
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,435
what electricity?

366
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,595
Can't you see

367
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,717
that it's dark all around?

368
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,159
There is war everywhere.

369
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,350
Go look somewhere else for his parents.

370
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,710
Allah is big... Allah knows it.

371
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,556
That way you'll find his relatives.

372
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,392
I told you we should leave him

373
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,238
with the master and go.

374
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,356
Didn't you hear what he said?

375
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,194
They're stealing our car! Let's get them!

376
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,235
God, it's true.

377
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,878
You're guilty of all that,

378
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,433
you dirty Saddam.

379
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,595
It's all your fault.

380
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,517
Go away from here, to your home.

381
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,680
Leave him alone,

382
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,113
what do you want from him?

383
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,198
Dirty bastard... jerk.

384
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,433
My dear, how many times

385
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,471
have I told you to leave him here?

386
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,238
Why do you put us in danger?

387
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,678
My heart couldn't bear leaving him

388
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,279
in the middle of the street.

389
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,391
Brother, I told you a hundred times:

390
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,112
Leave him there...

391
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,549
What should we do now?

392
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,352
Do? There's nothing we can do.

393
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,959
God has punished us.

394
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,275
Let's go, we have to

395
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,469
look for our car.

396
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,393
Where should we find the car

397
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,112
in this big town?

398
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,549
If we just sit here nothing will happen.

399
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,035
Maybe we'll find it
if we go into this direction.

400
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,549
You wouldn't find it
even if you were able to walk.

401
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,318
So let's go and have a look.

402
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,797
Did he leave something good behind?

403
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,433
He ran away!

404
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,239
You're not coming!

405
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,631
- Did you bring this car?
- Yes.

406
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Where from?

407
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,472
No time for questions.

408
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,919
Let's carry him.

409
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,994
A small kid is missing.

410
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,559
Have you seen it?

411
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,679
Go away... Go.

412
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Look...

413
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,313
Look, that belongs to us.

414
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,989
Ok, you had enough food.

415
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,278
Bastard!

416
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,918
<i>Safm... Gareh... Safm...</i>

417
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,195
<i>Safm... Safm...</i>

418
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,229
Answer me now!

419
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,078
Why don't you answer?

420
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,951
You answer. I wanna see what you

421
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,479
have to say to them.

422
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,828
Are you still hungry?

423
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,839
Haven't you just had a dish of rice?

424
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,196
Shall I pour some for you too?

425
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,158
You should be ashamed!

426
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,718
Cause I want to eat something?

427
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,432
Why don't you think first

428
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,994
about those people
who are waiting for us?

429
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,678
Aren't they hungry?

430
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,400
I want water.

431
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,598
Do you want some poison?

432
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,760
What is he saying?

433
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,313
He said that he's thirsty.

434
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,635
Well, I'm thirsty too.

435
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Take it, Blacky.

436
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Do you see that?

437
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,874
Yes, I see it.

438
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,319
There's no one inside.

439
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Well...

440
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,348
What should we do now?

441
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,636
What to do? Get in the car.

442
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,789
- Let's go.
- Yeah, we'll go.

443
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,909
The driver was killed inside his car.

444
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,351
We better get away from here.

445
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
Look...

446
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
What's that?

447
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,228
It's food.

448
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,315
Still hot.

449
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
What are you doing?

450
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,911
Eating food, we're hungry...

451
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
Why not?

452
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,033
I'm afraid it's not clean.

453
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,752
You won't find anything better

454
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,472
under these circumstances.

455
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,238
Now sit down and eat!

456
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,199
Get in the car my friends.

457
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
<i>Ym sorry?</i>

458
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,668
Get inside the car.

459
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,597
No, thanks. Go, go.

460
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,640
What is he saying?

461
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,278
He wants to take us in his car.

462
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,879
Today is the Iraqi's day.

463
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,558
The cannibal Saddam has gone.

464
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,795
People are celebrating.

465
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,920
What did he say?

466
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,228
I don't know.

467
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,440
Get in the car.

468
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,351
Come on, let's get in the car.

469
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,277
Come on Blacky, get in.

470
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,712
WhY don't You get in?

471
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,989
We're all Iraqis,

472
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,235
we're brothers.

473
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,272
I know Saddam has destroyed
Kurdistan and also the south.

474
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,719
Do you recognize this kid?

475
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,273
We found him on the street,

476
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,038
take him with you if you can.

477
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,354
No, I don't know him.

478
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,833
I'm going to Naserese

479
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,598
because I'm very happy today.

480
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,800
Stop, stop!

481
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,508
This is our car.

482
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,354
Don't go!

483
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,596
Let's go, hurry up.

484
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,071
Let's just leave him here.

485
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,031
Can I come along as well?

486
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,278
<i>Safm... Gareh... Safm...</i>

487
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,951
<i>Why don't you answer?</i>

488
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,360
<i>Answer me.</i>

489
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,518
Why don't you answer?

490
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,868
What should I say?

491
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,991
That they're not getting any food?

492
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,110
We'll get some food back. Let's go.

493
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,395
Or just the bowls.

494
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,430
Who said they are still over there?

495
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,680
Of course they are.

496
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,518
They remained there, for sure.

497
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,714
Hey Blacky...

498
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,994
Blacky is asleep.

499
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,309
Where are you going?

500
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,714
We're out of town now.

501
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,400
In fact, I don't know
where I'm going myself.

502
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,397
Stop, let's ask these people.

503
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,673
Our car is out of order.

504
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,155
Could we come to the village with you?

505
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,794
They say there is a mass grave.

506
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,071
Our brother has been missed

507
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,316
ever since an anti-Kurd operation.

508
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,949
My sister and I are looking for him.

509
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,319
Where does this road lead to, Mr. Priest?

510
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,590
This road leads to the top of the hill,

511
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,358
where there's a turn in the road

512
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,118
and then it goes back to the city.

513
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,390
Should we take you to the city?

514
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,715
This road leads into the city centre.

515
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,955
It's very close.

516
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,629
It's my pleasure.

517
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,708
Just a second please...

518
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,840
the hood.

519
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,436
Get in the front seat, Mr. Priest.

520
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,357
I can ride in the back.

521
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,471
- Please get in.
- Thank you.

522
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,473
Thank you so much, sir.

523
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,591
You're welcome, Mr. priest.

524
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,235
Let's go.

525
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,558
Just a minute.

526
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,599
Curse you, Saddam,

527
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,756
may God curse you!

528
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,838
Saddam, Saddam.

00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:06,475
<i>Based on our information
you have a target with two people.</i>

560
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,158
<i>Pursuit this target.</i>

561
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,709
Where is your home?

562
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,553
In this your neighbourhood?

563
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,720
Yes.

564
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,514
This alley?

565
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,680
Yes.

566
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Where is it?

567
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,678
Near a shop.

568
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,631
What's the name of the shop?

569
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,159
The name is Sabah.

570
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,349
Do you know the shop?

571
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,516
Yes, I buy toys there.

572
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,714
Wait, he says his home is here.

573
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:35,752
Does he? Isn't your home in this alley?

574
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,880
Yes.

575
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,228
Maybe he's telling lies.

576
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,719
He's not.

577
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,239
He's telling the truth.

578
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,839
Wait, stop the car.

579
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,839
Why are you getting out?

580
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,719
I want to come, too.

581
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,593
No way! Do you want to be stolen again?

582
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,836
I'm taking him, then I'll come back.

583
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,840
Let's go.

584
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,995
Did you take him?

585
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,031
Yes I did. Turn on the car's engine.

586
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,160
That quick?

587
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,271
I just gave him to them,
now let's go.

588
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,628
Who did you give him to?

589
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,034
I'll tell you on the way.

590
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,037
What? Tell me what you did with him!

591
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,434
Oh, let's go. I said

592
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,039
I'd tell you on the way.

593
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,390
Why don't you tell me now?

594
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,873
I took him over there,

595
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,274
and now he'll go home.

596
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,391
He will go home by himself, you say?

597
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,919
Yes, he'll go by himself.

598
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:15,272
Where are you going? Come on.

599
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,435
I'll go after him.

600
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,320
Come back!

601
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,640
Come back.

602
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,276
He said he'd kill me

603
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,799
if I turned around.

604
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:13,672
Why did you bring him back?

605
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,711
We barely got rid of the filthy dog.

606
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,751
Why did you come back,

607
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,593
you Arab jerk?

608
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,991
Leave him. That's enough.

609
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,636
The car will get us stuck on the road.

610
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,079
This is playing time.

611
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,788
Turn it on.

612
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,040
Enough... enough.

613
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,399
Where is your family?

614
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,831
Turn it off, that's enough.

615
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,996
Who is that, over there with Blacky?

616
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,553
What is it, Blacky?

617
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,309
It seems that he knows this boy.

618
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:41,913
Do you know this kid?

619
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,553
Yes, he's our neighbour.

620
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,193
Ahmad... come on, let's go.

621
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,515
Wait, wait...

622
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,715
Wait, wait...

623
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,559
- Who was that?
- Ahmed.

624
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,120
Get in...

625
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,959
God is my witness,

626
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,672
our child is missing.

627
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,520
What did he say?

628
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,958
<<Just like yourself,

629
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,355
we've been brutally

630
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:31,708
tortured by Saddam.

631
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,239
And I lost an arm

632
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,793
due to the torture.».

633
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,354
Tell him we'll find a solution.

634
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,679
Thank you, sir.

635
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,119
I swear to God,

636
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,550
if I find my son Saddam,

637
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:48,795
I'll change his name

638
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,473
to Abdullah.

639
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,673
Do you know

640
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:06,800
which way they went?

641
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,518
No, I don't know.

642
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,635
I think they went this way.

643
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,035
I'll take him to these houses.

644
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,588
Mother, mother.

645
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,640
Thank God,

646
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,591
we finally got rid of him.

647
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,436
Thanks a million, dear God.

648
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,392
<i>Safin... Gareh... Safbn.</i>

649
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,311
<i>Why don't you answer?</i>

650
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,998
<i>What happened to you?</i>

651
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,911
32-32, this is 40 talking to you.

652
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
403-40.

653
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,396
<i>Give me an answer. What happened?</i>

654
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,715
We've been fighting successfully,

655
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,478
we killed two militants.

656
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,113
We've also saved an Arab kid

657
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,834
who was their captive.

658
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,594
<i>Kid? What kid?</i>

659
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,631
<i>Leave him and come back to the base.</i>

660
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,591
Yes sir, understood.

661
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,358
What we can do now?

662
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,198
Leave him?

663
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,311
<i>To the entire force,</i>

664
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,953
<i>everybody back to the base.</i>

665
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,554
Where is the musician?
