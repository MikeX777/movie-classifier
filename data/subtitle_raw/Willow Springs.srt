1
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,189
But we have to get rid of him.

2
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,712
<i>I have never loved anyone</i>

3
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,870
<i>save for the child</i>
<i>that died inside me before it was born.</i>

4
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,036
<i>Since then, I know</i>
<i>that life is like a wave</i>

5
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,274
<i>on which you drift</i>

6
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,075
<i>always being careful not to drown,</i>

7
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,918
<i>only to die in the end after all.</i>

8
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,872
<i>And that my only protection is within me.</i>

9
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,679
<i>Every attempt</i>
<i>to find something on the outside,</i>

10
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,634
<i>or have expectations of someone</i>

11
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,877
<i>has ended in the pain of realization.</i>

12
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,478
<i>With the realization</i>

13
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,471
<i>that people love only their own reflections.</i>

14
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,678
<i>Blood red stains on towels,</i>

15
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,677
<i>oceans of clouds and light bulbs</i>
<i>surround me here.</i>

16
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,877
<i>I prefer to surrender</i>
<i>responsibility for my life</i>

17
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,355
<i>to Magdalena,</i>

18
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,278
<i>because she loves pain.</i>

19
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,993
<i>And the beauty of her face</i>

20
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,589
<i>is the beauty of pain.</i>

21
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,359
<i>For the last five years,</i>
<i>ever since I've been here,</i>

22
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,960
<i>I no longer have any memories.</i>

23
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,590
<i>I no longer have any memories.</i>

24
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,872
<i>My life has only begun again</i>
<i>since I came here.</i>

25
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,157
You stand there and daydream;

26
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,113
you wear your children's clothes
that no longer fit,

27
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,393
and seek comfort
with animals that do not understand you.

28
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,354
Four years ago, when you came to us,
I told you

29
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,553
that you should burn everything
that reminds you of your past.

30
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,637
Take the dress off.

31
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,518
Help Christina wash her hair,
and do your chores like you do every day.

32
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,310
That is the reason you are here.

33
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,875
Ila, come back this instant!

34
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,389
I greet you, North Star.

35
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,197
I greet you, cry of distant jackal.

36
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,270
I greet you, loneliness of ours.

37
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,919
Oh, my companions,
preserve the purity of your hands

38
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,873
that deny lascivious temptation.

39
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,356
You possess the purity of those
who spill the blood of others.

40
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,954
The blood of the people we have killed
is our protection.

41
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,754
You will never be afraid again.

42
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,870
I am the force that led you here.

43
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,678
I am helping you.
I love you more than I love myself.

44
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:07,676
For you, I believe in the power of the police
who do not see what we do.

45
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:14,116
I close your eyes so you do not see
the mountains and ocean that surround you.

46
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,270
I close your ears.
You do not hear the howling of dogs,

47
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,075
or the song of birds.

48
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,277
We live here.

49
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,033
We will always live here.
I take away your fear and your hope.

50
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,473
I do not want you to know
where you are and what you are.

51
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,390
I want you to consider your actions.

52
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:47,073
I am the fulfillment.
I am the force through which we live.

53
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,912
She is the force through which we live.

54
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,388
I love you more than I love myself.

55
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,118
She loves us more than she loves herself.

56
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,588
I am the force through which we breathe.

57
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,068
She is the force through which we breathe.

58
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,118
The water!

59
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:05,156
Ila, could you please bring me my water
so I may wash my face?

60
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,036
I cannot use
the stagnant water from yesterday.

61
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,039
I'm sick of doing
what everyone asks of me!

62
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,156
You stand up there giving me orders,
but you're closer to the well than I am!

63
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,954
In other words,
get your water yourself!

64
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,872
You must fetch the water,
or I can't bear you between us any longer.

65
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,959
You must take care of me,
that is your duty.

66
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,154
You listen to your music all the time.
I have to clean and cook!

67
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,637
Concerns about your beauty
have nothing to do with me.

68
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,516
If I were to go,
you'd have no one to look after you.

69
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,119
Don't you forget that!

70
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,110
You'd be lost with Magdalena,
who you must also obey!

71
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,072
Fetch me the water!

72
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,672
I want my water!

73
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,316
I want the water up here in my room.

74
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,318
I heard you throw the bucket.

75
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,514
Now you must
fetch me the water I need again.

76
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,269
Please. This instant.
- No!

77
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,877
It was only an accident.

78
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,072
I'll be more careful.

79
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,351
I'll fetch water.

80
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,868
I'll go now. Please don't be cross.

81
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,675
What are you mumbling?

82
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,156
You should not speak.

83
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,275
You should fetch me the water that I need.
- Magdalena just arrived.

84
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,670
Christina, go to your room!
You should be ready by now!

85
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,869
Have you forgotten
what you also swore to me?

86
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,231
Go, and do not come down
until you are your usual self.

87
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,436
But I fetched water for the last time today.

88
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,675
Make breakfast right away, Ila.

89
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,675
Yes.

90
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,075
Yes.

91
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,638
Where is my coffee?
I would also like coffee.

92
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,316
Come, Christina.
You can have some of mine.

93
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,150
I am going to tell you things now
that I have never told anyone before.

94
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:19,674
I have never loved anyone save for the child
that died inside me before it was born.

95
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,318
Since then I know
that life is like a wave

96
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,878
on which you drift,
always being careful not to drown,

97
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,995
only to die in the end after all.

98
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,471
I know that
my only protection is within me.

99
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,637
Every attempt
to find something on the outside,

100
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,798
or have expectations of someone,

101
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,673
has ended in the pain of realization.

102
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,435
With the pain of the realization

103
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:02,270
that people love
only their own reflections.

104
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,432
Blood red stains on towels,

105
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,270
oceans of clouds and light bulbs
surround me here.

106
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,518
I prefer to surrender
responsibility for my life

107
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,915
to Magdalena

108
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,113
because she loves pain.

109
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:31,075
And the beauty of her face
is the beauty of pain.

110
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,470
For the last five years,

111
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,311
since my parents died in the fire,

112
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,115
I no longer have any memories.

113
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,109
My life has only begun again
since I came here.

114
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,553
The radio is off.

115
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,916
Wouldn't you like to go to bed?

116
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,237
Ila, make some coffee for this stranger.

117
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,270
What stranger?

118
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,869
Coffee? What stranger?

119
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,276
Don't talk. Do as I say.

120
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,270
The starry heavens above me
and the moral law within me

121
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,357
are enough for me.

122
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,676
Throw the money away.

123
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,873
We live our own autonomous life.
We do not need the money.

124
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,113
Look at me.

125
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:35,359
You must follow me,
not reach out and grasp at nothing.

126
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,552
And when you are dead,
I will be the one to care for you,

127
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,399
to carry your bodies to their graves.

128
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:47,309
And the one who decided
what you do and do not have to fear.

129
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:51,794
Throw everything away
and remain yourselves, what you are.

130
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,636
What do you think
we're here for, anyway?

131
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:26,435
We must get rid of this young man.

132
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,551
He should stay here.

133
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,320
I love him!
I want him to stay here!

134
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,518
He should stay here!

135
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:07,316
I heard something outside.

136
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,320
Shouldn't we go see what it was?

137
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,198
Yes, of course.

138
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:35,788
Ila, come back this instant!

139
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,910
<i>And when you are dead,</i>
<i>I will be the one to care for you,</i>

140
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:27,270
<i>to carry your bodies to their graves.</i>

141
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:31,268
<i>And the one who decided</i>
<i>what you do and do not have to fear.</i>

142
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,479
<i>Throw everything away</i>
<i>and remain yourselves, what you are.</i>

143
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,435
But I just wanted... Forgive me!

144
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,638
But I just wanted to...

145
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,275
But I just wanted...

146
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,272
Magdalena, you're already awake?
