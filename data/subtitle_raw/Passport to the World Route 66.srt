00:00:00,061 --> 00:00:03,228
(upbeat techno music)

2
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:23,981
(pensive music)

3
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,720
- [Narrator] In America, one
road has fascinated travelers

4
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,450
from all over the world
for almost 100 years,

5
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,290
a unique and mythical road
that is part of the folklore

6
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,993
and even the great
American dream, Route 66.

7
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,320
In the land of opportunities, this road,

8
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,950
also known as US Highway
66, Will Rogers Highway,

9
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,980
or the main street of America,

10
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,170
originally stretched
over 3,800 kilometers,

11
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,633
connecting small towns and big cities.

12
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,870
The eight-state snake starts in Chicago

13
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,960
and runs through Illinois,
Missouri, Kansas,

14
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,430
Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona,

15
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,163
before ending at Santa
Monica in California.

16
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:54,150
Since its establishment in 1926,

17
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,910
Route 66 has grown with America,

18
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,260
being a part of many obstacles

19
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,710
the country has gone through.

20
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,690
Poverty-stricken families
escaped their former homes

21
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,370
off to a better future on Route 66

22
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,280
during the Great Depression.

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,830
Later, Route 66 became a
military transport corridor

24
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,630
during the Second World War.

25
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,480
And during post-war years,

26
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,770
Americans prospered, bought more cars,

27
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,553
and went on vacation on Route 66.

28
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,130
But Route 66's fame ultimately
led to its downfall,

29
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,530
when in 1956, U.S.
President Dwight Eisenhower

30
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,170
supported the construction of a new system

31
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,710
of high-speed, limited-access,

32
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,033
four-lane divided highways,
today's interstates.

33
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,370
Route 66 remains an
American historical landmark

34
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,820
where traces of the past
lie all along the route.

35
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,500
The old cars, the diners,
the motels, the neon signs,

36
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,320
and all its memorabilia
of the 50s and 60s,

37
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,660
this highway museum not only
attracts nostalgic Americans,

38
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,583
but people from all over the world.

39
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,340
With most of the original
roads still functional,

40
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,150
let's take a road trip back in time

41
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,680
through America's most iconic highway

42
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,680
with Big Brown, a 1976 AMC
Matador Brougham station wagon.

43
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:25,432
(upbeat music)

44
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,520
The trip down memory lane starts

45
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,950
on the intersection of
South Michigan Avenue

46
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,392
and historic US 66 in downtown Chicago.

47
00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:38,975
(upbeat music)

48
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,920
The first stop is at Lou Mitchells' diner,

49
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,130
a family business that's
been up and running

50
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,280
even before Route 66 was even created.

51
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,280
Since 1923, U.S. presidents,
mayors, governors,

52
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,160
senators, and athletes have been to Lou's

53
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,290
for top-quality food at affordable prices.

54
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,420
Sharon Wasberg, an employee at
Lou Mitchell's for 38 years,

55
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,563
tells us more about the
iconic diner and Mr. Mitchell.

56
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,333
- Mr. Mitchell and his
father built this place.

57
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:23,160
He came to work every morning.

58
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,070
He went in the market before he came here

59
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,883
and picked out the fruits and vegetables.

60
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,840
He used to stay here all day long.

61
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,940
At two o'clock in the afternoon,

62
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,410
he used to have his lunch.

63
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,640
He used to come at five in the morning,

64
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,530
at two in the afternoon, he had his lunch

65
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,720
and then he smoked his cigar.

66
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,530
He had a cigar everyday.

67
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,560
- [Narrator] The restaurant
has been welcoming commuters

68
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,900
from all over the world for a
good old American breakfast.

69
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,040
- Saturday was one of our busiest days,

70
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,040
and now it's still a Saturday
and Sunday, very busy days,

71
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,200
as you see a line out the door.

72
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,150
- [Narrator] Delicious
donut holes are handed out

73
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,400
to customers waiting in line.

74
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,210
- People come and they eat, and the leave,

75
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,670
because they know it's busy.

76
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,537
When Mr. Mitchell was
here, he used to say,

77
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:12,088
"Doesn't anyone ever go back to work?"

78
00:05:12,088 --> 00:05:15,280
(upbeat music)

79
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,113
It's fun to work.

80
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:17,890
It's nice meeting people all the time.

81
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,270
We have lots of people
from different countries.

82
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,920
They come her to do the Route 66.

83
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,970
They used to come here
from different countries,

84
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,023
Germany, whatever, on their
motorcycles, and do the route.

85
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:31,740
There'd be like 25, 30 at the time,

86
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,740
but now they find out
it's stupid to come here,

87
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,673
rent their motorcycles,
and then do the trip.

88
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:42,120
We've had people from every country.

89
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,200
I had three this morning,
three different tables

90
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,033
that were doing it today.

91
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,880
- [Narrator] Little ways down Route 66

92
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,310
to Chicago suburb of Cicero,

93
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,190
Henry's drive-in offers the best

94
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,440
Chicago-style hotdog around,

95
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,123
which are best-known for
being a meal in itself.

96
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,210
This classic hotdog stand was
started in the 50s by Henry,

97
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,430
and has survived through the years,

98
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,223
unlike other hotdog
stands erected later on.

99
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,890
(upbeat strings music)

100
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,140
About 50 kilometers down the highway,

101
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,000
in the city of Joliet, you can get dessert

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,113
at the Rich & Creamy ice cream store.

103
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,200
The monument has been restored
to its original appearance

104
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,143
from the booming days of Route 66.

105
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:38,571
(upbeat strings music)

106
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,000
Jake and Elwood, the Blues Brothers,

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,720
dance on the roof of the store,

108
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
representing a part of history

109
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,203
where Broadway was at its peak popularity.

110
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:58,630
(upbeat music)

111
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,930
Across the street is Dick's Towing,

112
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,160
with the original building still standing,

113
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,690
surrounded by a series of classic cars,

114
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,363
including a tow truck perched on the roof.

115
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,880
Farther down in Wilmington
stands the Gemini Giant statue,

116
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,890
which has been the
Launching Pad restaurant's

117
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,750
main decoration since
1965, and is recognized

118
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,620
as one of Route 66's historical landmarks.

119
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,523
Unfortunately, the restaurant
has been closed since 2010.

120
00:07:32,138 --> 00:07:35,638
(mellow percussion music)

121
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,460
Be mindful of the speed
limits in the area.

122
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,740
You might wind up in jail like Jake.

123
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,610
Nearby in Joliet

124
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,173
is the Will County Adult
Detention Facility.

125
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,380
You probably already
recognized the establishment

126
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,800
that was used to film this
classic film, The Blues Brothers,

127
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,343
where we saw Jake Blues
getting out of jail.

128
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,240
In Odell, Illinois, Standard
Oil gasoline station

129
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,860
has been there since 1932, and has kept

130
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,023
its original look with minor adjustments.

131
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,899
(upbeat percussion music)

132
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:23,090
For car enthusiasts, a
small break-in Pontiac

133
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,060
is a must to visit a recently opened

134
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,473
and entirely dedicated museum,
the Pontiac Oakland brand.

135
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:34,201
(upbeat music)

136
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,290
Strolling through the land of Lincoln,

137
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,300
you will see the tall Paul Bunyan statue,

138
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,830
one of several molded fiberglass
sculptures of its kind.

139
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,540
The first Paul Bunyan
character was holding an ax.

140
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,970
Then, using the same mold,
other characters were created.

141
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,800
At least three of them
are still in Illinois,

142
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,910
along Route 66.

143
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,010
This particular character was originally

144
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,800
at a hotdog restaurant in
Cicero, named Bunyan's.

145
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,570
In 2002, Bunyan's closed and
put the figure up for sale.

146
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,610
The city of Atlanta in Illinois

147
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,980
made a long-term loan
arrangement with the owners

148
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,390
to display the statue on Arch Street

149
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,697
as a symbol of Route 66.

150
00:09:49,697 --> 00:09:53,090
(upbeat music)

151
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,930
Across the street from
the Paul Bunyan statue

152
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,670
is the iconic Palms Cafe.

153
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,710
Once closed down and
reopened 10 years ago,

154
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,690
this Route 66 staple is a must-go

155
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,083
for classic Route 66 fare.

156
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,080
- The Palms Brew Cafe
actually opened its doors

157
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,610
first, in August of 1934,

158
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,480
ran through the late 1960s,

159
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,050
and then it closed down.

160
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,440
This building was completely gutted,

161
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,440
and it essentially
disappeared, until 2008,

162
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,830
and that's when the Atlanta
Public Library decided

163
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,140
it was going to reopen the cafe,

164
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,780
make it operational again, and hopefully,

165
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,530
help use it to attract
visitors and tourists to town,

166
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,250
because they owned the building.

167
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,050
The building happened to be donated.

168
00:10:46,968 --> 00:10:49,340
(upbeat music)

169
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,007
I, at the time, came off
with the idea and said,

170
00:10:52,007 --> 00:10:54,987
"You know, if we really want to use this

171
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,167
"for the benefit of the
town, let's recreate the cafe

172
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:01,360
"and turn it into an operating entity."

173
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,760
So we did, it opened in, I
think it was April of 2009.

174
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,880
So we're almost 10 years in operation now.

175
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,800
And it's been wonderful.

176
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,970
Our goal is to provide
folks with a little taste,

177
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,000
literally, of what it used to be like

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,803
to stop in a small town along Route 66.

179
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,610
We have several really
interesting items on the menu

180
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,700
that they used to serve back in the day,

181
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,960
fried bologna sandwiches,
fried spam sandwiches,

182
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,720
homemade pie, and everything that is done

183
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,090
here at the cafe is homemade.

184
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,558
That's one of the things
that distinguishes it.

185
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:42,400
(upbeat music)

186
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,010
We really didn't know what it looked like

187
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,060
when it first opened in 1936,

188
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,800
until I happened to be out
mowing my yard one day,

189
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,910
it was one of those small
town kind of things.

190
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,020
A woman I didn't know
pulled up in a pickup truck

191
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,150
in front of my yard,
rolled down the window,

192
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:04,780
and she had known that we
were going to reopen the cafe.

193
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,287
She handed me this picture, and she goes,

194
00:12:07,287 --> 00:12:10,521
"Here, I think you're going to want this."

195
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,080
(chuckles) So we had this
guide all of a sudden

196
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,690
as to what it looked like
when it first opened.

197
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,870
The reason she had the photo,

198
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,930
the women standing
behind the cash register

199
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,259
in the photo, is her grandmother.

200
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:25,710
(upbeat piano music)

201
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,210
If you really wanna walk in the door,

202
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:33,210
and all of sudden see, and
smell, and taste, and feel

203
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,840
what it used to be like
back in the 30s and 40s,

204
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,030
this is the place to come.

205
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,613
(upbeat music)

206
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:51,240
- [Narrator] Midway between
Springfield and Saint Louis

207
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,060
is the town of Litchfield,

208
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,120
tucked away in fields of corn,

209
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,287
soybeans, and wheat principal crops.

210
00:12:58,287 --> 00:13:00,870
(upbeat music)

211
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:06,110
The Ariston cafe was founded by Pete Adam,

212
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,073
a Greek immigrant in
Carlinville, Illinois in 1924.

213
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,710
The cafe was originally
located on Route 4,

214
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,960
but the restaurant was
relocated in Litchfield in 1929,

215
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,960
and moved to its original
location in 1935 along Route 66.

216
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,890
- So working here at the Ariston Cafe,

217
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,590
I believe that it's a lot
more than just a restaurant.

218
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,760
It's a business that's been here

219
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,420
even before 66 has even been started,

220
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,160
and it's just been evolved,
just as 66 has evolved

221
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,870
throughout time, so have we.

222
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,270
I feel like when we have
travelers that come in,

223
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,590
it's our job to make sure
they have a great experience

224
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:49,240
as they come from different countries,

225
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,110
coming to America, bringing business,

226
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,053
keeping the small businesses alive.

227
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,190
It's amazing just how
many different places

228
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,820
people are from.

229
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,180
Just last week, I had people from Japan,

230
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,258
a couple from Italy on their honeymoon.

231
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:08,841
(mellow music)

232
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,020
- [Narrator] The town
came close to disappearing

233
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,423
back when the railroads
were under construction.

234
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,420
There was a debate upon which town

235
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,450
the railroad was going to pass through,

236
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,100
coming from Saint Louis,

237
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,500
Litchfield, or the town of Hardinsburg,

238
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,190
two miles southwest.

239
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,000
When it was decided that Litchfield

240
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,290
would have the railroads pass through,

241
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,340
the residents of Hardinsburg
had prepared for the worst,

242
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,870
and had their houses built on skids.

243
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,193
They hooked them up on oxen,
and dragged them to Litchfield.

244
00:14:53,128 --> 00:14:55,711
(upbeat music)

245
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,870
As Big Brown passes through
Litchfield, another restaurant,

246
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,840
the Cozy Dog Drive In,
is a good place to stop

247
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,313
for a delicious hotdog on a
stick, an American classic.

248
00:15:09,524 --> 00:15:12,107
(upbeat music)

249
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,710
In Mount Olive, the
Soulsby's Service Station

250
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,223
still stands since 1926,

251
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,730
with its house and canopy
gas station design,

252
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,753
a popular style in its time.

253
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,090
Unfortunately, it no
longer serves gasoline,

254
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,840
much like the other historic
gas stations along Route 66,

255
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,124
but it is a sight to see.

256
00:15:52,124 --> 00:15:54,707
(upbeat music)

257
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,740
The last stop in the state of Illinois

258
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,240
is Country Classic Cars in Stanton.

259
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,030
What began as a hobby
for a mid-western farmer

260
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:19,920
grew into a collection
of over 630 classic cars.

261
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,730
- As the owners started in

262
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,410
probably around 20 years ago,

263
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:27,440
actually at his farm selling cars,

264
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,210
and he just kept growing,
and then he finally

265
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,600
had to buy some property somewhere else.

266
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,120
It got too big there at the farm,

267
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,870
so he found this property.

268
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,360
And it started with, I
think, 20 cars or so,

269
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,182
something like that, and just kept growing

270
00:16:42,182 --> 00:16:44,150
(laughs) to what it is now today.

271
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,060
- [Narrator] Country
Classic Cars isn't just

272
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,420
a museum for car fanatics to visit.

273
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,970
You can buy them, from road-ready
classics to muscle cars.

274
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,887
You can find it at this
family-owned business.

275
00:16:54,887 --> 00:16:57,140
(upbeat music)

276
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,853
But, the journey has its ups and downs.

277
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,200
- Last August, we had a fire here.

278
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,710
We're not sure what started it,

279
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,270
but we're thinking it was a car,

280
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,770
possibly electrical (mumbles).

281
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:11,980
And it started in the middle
of one of the buildings

282
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,203
and just spread out, you
know, it was in the evening.

283
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,190
We actually had 13 fire departments here

284
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,080
from different areas, to get it out.

285
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,100
I mean, it was a total loss.

286
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,883
We lost 142 cars there.

287
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,360
And of course, the complete building,

288
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,970
so we had to rebuild the building.

289
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,580
And as you can see now,
we've got most of the cars

290
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,870
replaced with different cars.

291
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,250
- [Narrator] The
collection of classic cars

292
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,130
has travelers from all over the world

293
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,080
coming to visit through their
road trip on the Mother Road.

294
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,710
- There's so many people
that drive by here,

295
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,860
turn around and come back and look at it.

296
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,770
And there's people from all
over the world, actually,

297
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,110
the planned trips, you
know, to do Route 66

298
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,223
from Chicago to Los Angeles.

299
00:17:59,917 --> 00:18:02,713
This is usually one of
their stops on their trip.

300
00:18:03,886 --> 00:18:08,090
In the summertime, it's
just people non-stop,

301
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,744
coming in here.

302
00:18:09,744 --> 00:18:12,327
(upbeat music)

303
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,880
- [Narrator] The Mississippi River divides

304
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,230
the state of Illinois and
the state of Missouri.

305
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,840
Crossing the river, you'll take

306
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,533
the new Chain of Rocks Bridge.

307
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,670
This bridge has two versions.

308
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:34,500
The older version was used
for Route 66 prior to 1970,

309
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,310
but now, it serves only for
pedestrians and cyclists,

310
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,240
as a historical landmark.

311
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,730
Once you've crossed the river,

312
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,680
the Gateway Arch welcomes travelers

313
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,400
to the city of Saint Louis.

314
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,820
Standing 630 feet tall,

315
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,080
it's the tallest arch in the world.

316
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,190
The design was thought up

317
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,550
by Finnish-American
architect Eero Saarenen.

318
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,250
The Gateway Arch was envisioned to revive

319
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,693
and stimulate the economy of Saint Louis.

320
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,210
Its construction was finalized in 1965,

321
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,720
and remains the tallest
man-made structure in America.

322
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,270
The memorial monument was
dedicated to the American people,

323
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,030
honoring the development
of the westward expansion

324
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,550
of the United States.

325
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:19,360
It is a must-see for
travelers on Route 66.

326
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,860
After seeing pre-boarding
exhibits featuring

327
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,440
60s-era animation and Gateway Arch trivia,

328
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,810
take a tram ride to the
top for a beautiful view

329
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,652
stretching up to 50 kilometers out.

330
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:33,235
(upbeat music)

331
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,840
In Saint Louis, Ted Drewes Frozen Custard

332
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,300
has become a popular treat amongst locals

333
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,373
and tourists traveling on Highway 66.

334
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,000
The store was built in 1941,

335
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,160
and has kept its original design

336
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,713
down to the serving cups.

337
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,240
Due to the success of the business,

338
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,610
Ted Drewes Jr. decided to expand

339
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,960
the size of the store in 1985,

340
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,410
having 12 serving windows instead of five.

341
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,970
The family business' signature
treat is the concrete,

342
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,263
which was created in 1959.

343
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,740
The concrete is a custard so thick

344
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,503
that it is served upside down.

345
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,620
Only two stands out of four,

346
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,170
and are still up and running,

347
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,369
both on the south of Saint Louis.

348
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:26,786
(mellow saxophone music)

349
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:33,880
Big Brown strays away from U.S. 66,

350
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,650
three miles off the
highway down a winding road

351
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:39,110
in the woods of Stanton, Missouri.

352
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,910
Down a valley lies a hidden treasure

353
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,780
beneath the ground, the Meramec Caverns.

354
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,780
Time has allowed limestone formations

355
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,460
to create some of the most beautiful

356
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,320
underground wonders in the world,

357
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,280
which stretch across 7.4 kilometers.

358
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,150
- Most folks that come to
visit the Meramec Caverns,

359
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,750
a lot of them are left in awe.

360
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,700
The don't quite know what to expect.

361
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,700
When they leave here, they're
basically reminded of how

362
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,690
there's so much beauty beneath the Earth

363
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,557
that they didn't really expect to see.

364
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:13,180
- [Narrator] The
400-million-year old caves

365
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,410
made of limestone have
served multiple purposes

366
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,140
over the years, from
sheltering Native Americans,

367
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,010
to becoming a saltpeter plant

368
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,100
for the manufacturing of gunpowder,

369
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,780
to serving as a ballroom
for square dancing events

370
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,420
in the late 19th century.

371
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,790
The cave system is one of
Route 66's biggest attractions.

372
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,240
- It's quite rich in family history

373
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,230
as well as Missouri history.

374
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,993
The Caverns has been used in
numerous Hollywood movies,

375
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,290
and then dating back
even further than that,

376
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:47,000
our cave was used during the
Civil War in the United States.

377
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,110
And even prior to that, it
was used for exploration

378
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:55,280
and in the hopes of
finding valuables, gold,

379
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,340
but none was ever found in our cave.

380
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,820
- [Narrator] In 1935, Lester B. Dill

381
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,720
opened the caves to tourists.

382
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,830
Dill was the sole creator
of the bumper sticker,

383
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,470
using the stickers as a means

384
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,420
of promoting the caverns,
along with billboards.

385
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,540
- My great grandfather first purchased

386
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,103
this area where the cave is.

387
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,860
What he knew that was going on

388
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,420
was square dancing inside of the cave.

389
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,810
It was a weekend hobby, and he used that

390
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,730
to fund his exploration of the cave.

391
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:26,710
He did weekends (mumbles)
during the week as well.

392
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:30,270
He went on to discover
the entire seven levels

393
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,740
of Meramec Caverns.

394
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,330
We call ourselves the
oldest staff on Route 66

395
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,453
because we've been here for
thousands of years, literally.

396
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,350
- [Narrator] Back on the main street,

397
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,533
Big Brown heads down 23
miles to Cuba, Missouri.

398
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,770
The Wagon Wheel Motel was built

399
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,203
in the chaotic times of 1935,

400
00:22:55,203 --> 00:22:58,170
when the nation was barely
out of the depression,

401
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:01,293
and the Dust Bowl had
destroyed millions of acres.

402
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,123
It included the cabins, a
cafe, and a gas station.

403
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,060
Robert and Margaret Martin
were the first owners

404
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,433
of the Wagon Wheel Cabins,
purchasing the land in 1934.

405
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,813
The Martins hired Leo
Friesenhan to do the building.

406
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,240
Local farmers carried the stone to him

407
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,530
to build the indestructible cabins.

408
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,310
There are 14 cabins at
the Wagon Wheel Motel,

409
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,330
with 12 car shelters
and two locked garages,

410
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:36,150
but due to the increasing
length of automobiles,

411
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,360
tourism trade, and military
traffic, the garages

412
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,940
and the buildings were
converted into units.

413
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,970
After World War II, the cabins, the cafe,

414
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,720
and the gas station were split

415
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,080
and sold to different owners.

416
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,593
It's still there, bearing
its original look.

417
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,073
(upbeat music)

418
00:24:01,364 --> 00:24:03,490
It isn't uncommon on Route 66

419
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,870
to bump into friendly
travelers like Vincent Daino,

420
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,810
who is traveling Route 66

421
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:12,270
entirely on his motorbike from California.

422
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,790
- What I'm learning the
most, I think, on this trip,

423
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:18,850
aside from the noted structures
and the iconic symbols

424
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,987
and visitor points, is the personalities

425
00:24:22,987 --> 00:24:25,280
and the people that I have been meeting,

426
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,980
the people that, for instance, run

427
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,700
this establishment, the Wagon Wheel.

428
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,260
I spent last night at the Munger Moss

429
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,603
and got to know Ramona, she's an angel.

430
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,660
They still have the essence of Americana.

431
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,010
They still have the essence

432
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:44,630
of friendship and neighborly love,

433
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:47,900
and between Santa Monica and here,

434
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,640
I have had issues with my motorcycles

435
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,210
where I've had people on
Route 66 seeing me stop,

436
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,093
and they'll come out and render aid.

437
00:24:55,982 --> 00:24:57,980
It makes you feel you're back in the 50s

438
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,110
where people who lived in the areas

439
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,080
wanted to make sure that their travelers,

440
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,440
if you're a traveler and
you got stuck in their area,

441
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,230
they were your guests.

442
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,510
So I would say pulls of
Route 66 are the people

443
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,770
that live and work in those communities

444
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,100
and treat us like we're family
members, not even knowing us.

445
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,310
State by state, venue by venue,

446
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,430
each one is the course of the meal.

447
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,470
I wouldn't do justice by elevating one

448
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,800
and not comparing it to the other.

449
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,550
There is no comparison.

450
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,400
But if I did that and
wind it down to one thing,

451
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,680
it's the human interaction of the people

452
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,980
who are keeping Route 66 alive,

453
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,970
adding and maintaining the
structures and buildings.

454
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,300
There's an element where I'm on the road

455
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,880
in these open stretches
and you're enjoying

456
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,200
this Route 66 pavement where
you're lost in your thoughts.

457
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,070
But I would have to say the
(mumbles) of my experience

458
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,200
is the personalities, the human contact,

459
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,393
the human element that really bring,

460
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,690
what really bring that,

461
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,480
that movie car and Walt Disney alive

462
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,873
is that personality and humankind.

463
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,840
- [Narrator] Not too far down the road

464
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,920
is the Missouri Hick for a
choice of different meats

465
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,560
that have been smoked
overnight for 12 hours.

466
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,440
It's worth the stop to grab a bite,

467
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,580
to eat at the Missouri Hick.

468
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,530
The two-story barbecue
shack with a hillbilly theme

469
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,890
is the pride of Dennis Meiser,

470
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,010
a master barbecuer and woodworker

471
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,990
whose skills are displayed
all over the place.

472
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,800
From the handmade tables and chairs

473
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,530
to the cedar stairs
leading up to the balcony,

474
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:33,387
there is no mistaking the skill
that went into this place.

475
00:26:33,387 --> 00:26:35,970
(upbeat music)

476
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,550
7.5 kilometers down Will Rogers
Highway in Fanning, Missouri

477
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,300
is where you can see what used to be

478
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,560
the world's largest rocking chair.

479
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,530
(upbeat music)

480
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,710
Built on April Fools Day in 2008,

481
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,580
Dennis' mighty chair is 42 feet,

482
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:00,530
four inches high on rockers
each tree 1.5 feet long.

483
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,900
It lost its title as the
world's biggest rocking chair

484
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,740
in 2015, by a 56.5-foot
tall chair in Illinois,

485
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,053
but is still a part of
Route 66's hall of fame.

486
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,023
(mellow music)

487
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,770
The main street of America went through

488
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,070
various modifications to meet the needs

489
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:26,400
of the U.S. military
routes during World War II,

490
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,970
as well as when the highway
was decommissioned completely.

491
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,650
Hundreds of businesses fought to survive.

492
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,203
This was the case for
the Munger Moss Motel.

493
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,290
It all began at the
Munger Moss Sandwich Shop

494
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,280
in Devil's Elbow, Missouri,

495
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,280
built in 1936 by Nelle Munger
and husband Emmett Moss.

496
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:49,190
Unfortunately, business drastically slowed

497
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,680
due to the relocation of Route 66 in 1942

498
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,220
to accommodate heavy military traffic

499
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,700
going to and from nearby
Fort Leonard Wood.

500
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,860
The business was sold to
Jesse and Pete Hudson in 1945

501
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:06,070
and moved to the town of
Lebanon, 30 minutes away.

502
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,530
They built a sandwich
shop and a gas station,

503
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:11,180
and a year later, built
the motel during the time

504
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,560
when rationing was still enforced.

505
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,500
Some tales say the lumber that was used

506
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,570
to build the motel was
purchased off the black market.

507
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:21,403
It seems as though construction
went on day and night.

508
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,140
The Feds could not stop the construction

509
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,800
if there was no sign of the owner,

510
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,650
so Mr. Hudson stayed hid most of the time.

511
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:34,640
The new four-lane Route
66 was opened in 1957,

512
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,940
and bypassed the booming motel,
threatening its survival.

513
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,080
But that did not stop Mr. Hudson.

514
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,610
He went down to the corner
and placed wood plank

515
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:45,100
across the ditch and
formed a makeshift bridge

516
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,303
to his motel, along
with a big painted sign.

517
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,250
Munger Moss was not going to be bypassed.

518
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,450
And it worked.

519
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,993
The business lives on.

520
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,930
The last stop before heading
off to the state of Kansas

521
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,617
is Gary's Gay Parita.

522
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,210
- This place was founded in 1926

523
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,800
by Fred and Gay Mason.

524
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,960
All the buildings here were put up

525
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,820
between 1926 and finally finished in 1930.

526
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,540
Would have been the
garage, the gas station,

527
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,450
the house on the hill, and
the white building over there

528
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,730
was a grain and feeds store.

529
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,540
In addition to that, they had three cabins

530
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,890
where people could stay
and spend the night.

531
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:37,070
- [Narrator] The owner,
Gary, was always excited

532
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,210
to meet the travelers coming
through and stopping by.

533
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:44,010
- Gary loved to see everyone on the Route.

534
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,760
For him, he wasn't just talking to people,

535
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,660
he was making friends.

536
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,490
And his motto for this
place and ours as well,

537
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,760
friends for life.

538
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,243
Once you come to Parita,
you're friends for life.

539
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,080
- [Narrator] Route 66 only goes on

540
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,740
for approximately 20 kilometers
in the state of Kansas.

541
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,010
If there's something worth stopping for,

542
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:10,010
it's that the cars on the Route
66 that showcases replicas

543
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,663
from the famous cartoon movie, Cars.

544
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,860
By the way, the original
version that was used

545
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,123
by modelers at Pixar created (inaudible)

546
00:30:20,123 --> 00:30:24,005
who stands proudly next to
the version that we all know.

547
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:26,588
(upbeat music)

548
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,900
Now in Oklahoma.

549
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,333
The first stop is at
the Afton Gas station.

550
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,260
This station was neglected

551
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,170
by its previous owner for many years.

552
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,040
It was only in 1998 that David Kane

553
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,340
bought the station and renovated it.

554
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,880
Over the years, the building

555
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,890
has housed multiple enterprises,

556
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,590
including 24-hour gas stations,

557
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,300
a large service garage,

558
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,570
a beauty parlor,

559
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:54,350
a western auto store,

560
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,150
a boat manufacturing plant,

561
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,230
and many other businesses.

562
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,520
The buildings today serve
as a visitors center

563
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,010
and an extensive collection of Route 66

564
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,950
and auto memorabilia,

565
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,630
and houses an eclectic
collection of Packard automobiles

566
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,838
along with other significant classic cars.

567
00:31:11,838 --> 00:31:14,421
(mellow music)

568
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:18,591
(mellow strings music)

569
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,240
30 kilometers down Route 66

570
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,027
is Allen's Conoco Fillin'.

571
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,640
The tiny station was built
out from the exterior wall

572
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,883
of the final building on Main Street.

573
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,503
It now serves as a museum and gift shop.

574
00:31:42,503 --> 00:31:45,086
(mellow music)

575
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:49,527
(upbeat music)

576
00:31:55,745 --> 00:31:58,180
Off the Main Street
road, a lot of travelers

577
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,770
on their roadtrip down Route
66 make a detour to Foyil

578
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,280
to see Ed Galloway's world's largest

579
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,060
concrete totem pole at the Totem Park.

580
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,360
- It started with Mr. Galloway.

581
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,123
He is the totem pole creator.

582
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,510
When he was a young man,

583
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,930
he was always interested in woodworking,

584
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,990
that's why he has fiddles,

585
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,980
the beautiful furniture pieces.

586
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,440
But I think the totem
pole actually started

587
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,980
when he was a very young man.

588
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,070
He was in the Spanish-American War,

589
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,670
and he was in the Philippines.

590
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:33,450
And that was a particularly
hard war that hurt his heart.

591
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,207
- [Narrator] The totem is 60 feet tall

592
00:32:35,207 --> 00:32:37,270
and 30 feet in circumference.

593
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,320
Inside the locked totem is a ladder

594
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,567
that climbs up four stories.

595
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:44,150
(mellow music)

596
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,120
Ed Galloway was born in Missouri,

597
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,300
fought in the Spanish-American War,

598
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,870
and while on his way to
California with his family,

599
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,150
he took a temporary job in Foyil.

600
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,020
- He built it as a way for people

601
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,560
to enjoy each other, to fellowship.

602
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,963
He wanted to build beautiful
work in art and give it to us.

603
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:08,397
Some of his last words were,
"I did the best I knew how,

604
00:33:08,397 --> 00:33:10,247
"built these things by
the side of the road

605
00:33:10,247 --> 00:33:11,630
"to be a friend to you."

606
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,540
And that's what he did,
he shared his artwork

607
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,813
with the world, it's what his goal was.

608
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:19,620
- [Narrator] He then spent
20 years teaching young boys

609
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,270
woodworking in the Children
Home Orphanage in Sand Springs

610
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,553
and retired in Foyil.

611
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,983
(upbeat music)

612
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:32,010
Some might think the large totem he built

613
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,290
was in honor of Native American tribes,

614
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,710
but he said it just gave him

615
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,720
something to do when he retired,

616
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,920
and would probably be a good
attraction for young ones,

617
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,440
boy scouts, in particular, to visit.

618
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,430
It took him 11 years to
complete the large totem,

619
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,010
which was finalized in 1948.

620
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:52,010
Ed built several other
sculptures around his property

621
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,843
but none bigger than the totem.

622
00:33:58,474 --> 00:34:03,474
(waves lapping)
(gentle music)

623
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,350
Some people give flowers to
their wives on anniversaries,

624
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:11,703
but others give 80-feet
long concrete sperm whales.

625
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,040
The Blue Whale, one of Route 66's icons,

626
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,863
is built along the shores of
a pond in Catoosa, Oklahoma.

627
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,840
Hugh Davis unveiled this
mastodon to his wife, Zelta,

628
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,280
on their 34th wedding
anniversary in the 1970s,

629
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,440
which he originally built

630
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,880
for the use of just the Davis kids,

631
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,960
with a diving platform on its tail

632
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,710
and a slide coming out of its head.

633
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,730
On their property, the Davises

634
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,653
were operating an alligator farm.

635
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:51,940
But David eventually closed
the attraction in 1988.

636
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:55,510
For a decade, the whale
fell into disrepair,

637
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:58,823
but it was too visible and
too beloved to be left behind.

638
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:03,730
Now, every few years, whale
boosters converge on Catoosa

639
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:07,143
to patch its concrete and
give it a fresh coat of paint.

640
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,770
Next stop is at Pops, a modern gas station

641
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,370
and restaurant where you can find

642
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:18,170
a signature collection
of 700 kinds of soda,

643
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:21,433
sparkling waters, and other
ice cold refreshments.

644
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,430
It's hard to miss the huge neon sign

645
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,173
in the shape of a soda pop bottle.

646
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:33,163
It stands 66 feet tall,
in honor of Route 66.

647
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,707
- We carry anywhere from 750

648
00:35:37,707 --> 00:35:39,653
to 800 different flavors of soda,

649
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,280
all different brands
from different countries,

650
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,460
different places.

651
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,470
There are some that we do not
get anymore at quick bottling.

652
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,200
A lot of bottles you
see on the shelves here,

653
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,920
they've been up for 11 years.

654
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,643
The only time we really change
is when the color goes out.

655
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,080
Bottles, that's one of our biggest sale

656
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,470
as other people come from all over

657
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,730
just to (mumbles) selection of bottle.

658
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:04,240
So we have all brand which
we have a great plains soda

659
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,820
which is basically great.

660
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,870
Then we have our orange crane (mumbling).

661
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:12,030
Then we have the Round Barn root beer

662
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,520
which is our brand as well,

663
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,797
which we bottle (mumbling).

664
00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:18,867
(upbeat music)

665
00:36:33,468 --> 00:36:36,718
(mellow strings music)

666
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,450
- [Narrator] Many villages
along the route try

667
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:47,450
and take advantage of the
renewed excitement for Route 66.

668
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:51,090
It's the case of Elk City,
who has proposed a museum

669
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,980
that will please and impress the true fans

670
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,323
of this mythical road.

671
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,660
If you do decide to take on

672
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,750
the entirety of Route 66,

673
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,100
stray away from fake attractions,

674
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,174
and take advantage of the real ones.

675
00:37:06,174 --> 00:37:08,757
(upbeat music)

676
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,020
The last stop in the state of Oklahoma

677
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,440
is a shop where nothing is for sale,

678
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,570
and its greatest
curiosities are its owners,

679
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,453
Harley and Annabelle Russel,
the Mediocre Music Makers.

680
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,750
If you're interested in
a personal music concert,

681
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,940
you might get lucky

682
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,780
at the Sandhills Curiosity Shop in Erick.

683
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,460
In the shop, you'll
find old oak furniture,

684
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,300
a variety of artwork, and
vintage music instruments,

685
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,183
along with other curious
and fascinating object.

686
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,120
Entering the land of the cowboys,

687
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,840
in Shamrock lies the U-Drop Inn.

688
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,320
This gas station and
restaurant was built in 1936

689
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,810
for the amount of $23,000.

690
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:14,020
The design for the place
is said to be drawn

691
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,270
by a friend of the owner,
who picked up an old nail

692
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:20,170
and scratched out the plans
for the building in the dirt.

693
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:23,120
The local newspaper said
it was the swankiest

694
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,020
of swank eating places,

695
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,700
and was the most up-to-date
edifice of its kind

696
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:32,360
on U.S. Highway 66, between
Oklahoma City and Amarillo.

697
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,770
It happens regularly today for customers

698
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,470
to stop and say that they ate in the cafe

699
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:41,330
20, 30, 40, even 50 years ago.

700
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:45,330
In 2003 and 2004, the building received

701
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:49,320
a 1.7 million federal
grant in which the city

702
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,050
was able to hire a firm specializing

703
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:54,000
in historical renovation.

704
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,300
The building has since been
restored to its original glory

705
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,220
and adapted into a museum,
visitors center, gift shop,

706
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,734
and the city's Chamber of Commerce.

707
00:39:04,734 --> 00:39:08,240
(upbeat strings music)

708
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,200
In Groom, Texas stands slanted

709
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,530
one of the most iconic
attractions of Route 66,

710
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,943
the Leaning Water Tower.

711
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,210
It is a strange sight to see,

712
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,380
unsettling, yet fascinating.

713
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,090
Unfortunately, this Leaning Water Tower

714
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:26,500
was an ingenious marketing ploy.

715
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,160
Ralph Britten, a man
who wanted to start up

716
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,820
a truck stop and restaurant
off Route 66 in Groom,

717
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,320
bought the water tower
from the town of Lefors

718
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,750
to attract new visitors.

719
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,190
He towed the enormous thing
55 kilometers to Groom,

720
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:44,430
wrote Britten USA on top,
and then, using a bulldozer,

721
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:47,010
elevated two of its legs off the ground,

722
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,640
dangling them in mid-air without support,

723
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,670
so that the water tower
made an 80-degree angle

724
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:53,503
with the ground.

725
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,650
Passersby would think that the tower

726
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,710
was in the process of collapsing.

727
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,580
Worried route takers
often swerved off the road

728
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,607
and into his truck top,
shouting, "Watch out!

729
00:40:04,607 --> 00:40:06,520
"The tower is about to fall."

730
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,590
Britten would say that it
had been like that for years,

731
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:12,130
and invited them to have
some food and drinks.

732
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:14,560
It worked very well to attract customers.

733
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,180
Unfortunately, the truck
stop burnt down and closed,

734
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,253
but the Leaning Tower is still there.

735
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:25,160
There is no way to miss the
Big Texan in Amarillo, Texas

736
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,870
when passing by Route 66.

737
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:30,720
The Big Texan is a restaurant, brewery,

738
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,190
motel, gift shop, and even horse motel.

739
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,010
- It was my father that came down.

740
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,060
He was from Chicago and
he didn't know anything

741
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:42,750
about being a cowboy, what
western was really all about.

742
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,584
And he came down here
and he wanted to open up

743
00:40:44,584 --> 00:40:47,270
a cowboy restaurant, so he did everything

744
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,970
in his power to make it
cowboy, it wasn't working.

745
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:52,650
But the thing that did
make it cowboy was the fact

746
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,180
that the original Big
Texan was right next door

747
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,350
to the stock yards, and there was hundreds

748
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,950
and hundreds of cowboys
that worked there everyday.

749
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:02,700
They would come into his
place everyday after work,

750
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,300
and he would cash or pay checks
and sell them nickel beer.

751
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,740
And they started acting like Texans do,

752
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,880
so he put them at the very
center table of the dining room

753
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,880
and allowed them to do
whatever they wanted to do,

754
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,460
and if you will, paint
the wet canvas at Texas,

755
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,040
so (mumbles) would come in

756
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,440
and see this table for the cowboys,

757
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,340
watching them act like what they expected,

758
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,990
and that's what gave the
Big Texan its personality,

759
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,160
was the people coming here,

760
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,287
not really what he thought
he knew about being cowboy.

761
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:32,704
(chattering)

762
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,320
Well, the 72-ounce steak challenge started

763
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,700
with the same thing with my dad

764
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,550
about these cowboys that
are in his restaurant,

765
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,970
they were acting like cowboys

766
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,317
and they were always
trying to outdo each other.

767
00:41:45,317 --> 00:41:47,157
"My muscle's bigger than yours.

768
00:41:47,157 --> 00:41:48,027
"I'm smarter than you.

769
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:49,420
"I can eat more than you."

770
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,640
And the eat more than you
appealed to my father,

771
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,337
and he was smart enough to say,

772
00:41:53,337 --> 00:41:56,407
"Next Friday, I got 12
seats at this table.

773
00:41:56,407 --> 00:41:58,593
"I'll give everybody one-pound steaks

774
00:41:58,593 --> 00:42:00,697
"for over an hour period of time,

775
00:42:00,697 --> 00:42:03,247
"and whoever eats the
most one-pound steaks,

776
00:42:03,247 --> 00:42:05,330
"I'm gonna give it to you all free."

777
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:08,400
So one cowboy ate four and
a half one-pound steaks.

778
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,220
He was a big show-off, so
he ordered a baked potato,

779
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,160
shrimp cocktail, tossed
salad and bread with it,

780
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,480
and he ate the entire meal.

781
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,537
And my dad said, "From this day forward,

782
00:42:17,537 --> 00:42:20,947
"in 1960, whoever can eat four
and a half pounds of beef,

783
00:42:20,947 --> 00:42:24,137
"a baked potato, a shrimp
cocktail, a raw butter,

784
00:42:24,137 --> 00:42:25,080
"it's for free."

785
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,000
And 58 years ago, it hasn't changed a bit.

786
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,800
It's still the 72-ounce steak challenge.

787
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,810
The quickest was by a lady

788
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,940
who also owns all the record sport.

789
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,840
She weighs 128 pounds, and she ate

790
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,680
three 72-ounce steaks in 20 minutes,

791
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,650
the first one in three and a half minutes.

792
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:46,570
A lady, a 128-pound lady,

793
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,960
three 72-ounce steaks in 20 minutes.

794
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,370
But it's still (mumbles).

795
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:52,000
Everybody else comes in to try it,

796
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,960
and it's still the same percentages.

797
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,910
One out of every six
men will take it down.

798
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:00,600
One out of every two women will eat it.

799
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,110
So the percentage hasn't changed

800
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:04,830
and it's not about the big
(mumbles) that comes in here,

801
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,560
or the little tiny guy.

802
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,860
You never know who's gonna do it.

803
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,500
20 minutes into this contest,
you can usually tell.

804
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,770
Route 66 gave the Big Texan its birth.

805
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,830
It's because of Route 66, it carried all

806
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:21,440
the east-west travelers
through this part of Texas.

807
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,500
And when they come through here,

808
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,900
they wanted to see cowboys,

809
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,040
like if you go to Hawaii,

810
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,400
you expect to see a girl in a grass skirt.

811
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,410
When they come to this part of Texas,

812
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,030
they want to see the cowboy,

813
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,670
they want to see the big steaks,

814
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,300
they wanna see people on horseback.

815
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,510
And that's what my father
was smart enough to realize

816
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,970
and that's what they get to see.

817
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:42,277
And if it wasn't for Route
66, it wouldn't have happened.

818
00:43:42,277 --> 00:43:45,527
(mellow strings music)

819
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,460
- [Narrator] The Cadillac Ranch,

820
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,430
one of Route 66's attractions

821
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,290
west of Amarillo, Texas,

822
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,630
was invented and built by a group

823
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:59,300
of art hippies from San Francisco.

824
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,420
The group called themselves the Ant Farm

825
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,490
and created the piece of work
for their silent partner,

826
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:07,210
Amarillo billionaire Stanley Marsh 3.

827
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,850
He wanted an art piece
that would turn heads.

828
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,410
And the hippies came up with a tribute

829
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:15,210
to the evolution of the Cadillac Tailfin.

830
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:18,300
10 caddies were driven into
one of Stanley's fields,

831
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,120
then buried, nose down, in the dirt,

832
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,940
supposedly at the same angle

833
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,930
as the Great Pyramid of Giza.

834
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,010
They faced west in a line,

835
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:31,750
from the 1949 Club sedan,
to the 1963 Deville.

836
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:34,410
Their tailfins held high for all to see

837
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:36,890
on the empty Texas Panhandle.

838
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:39,020
Since the creation of the art piece,

839
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,490
many who've come to see
it have taken the liberty

840
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,820
of grabbing a piece and
taking it home as a souvenir.

841
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,820
This did not bother its creators,

842
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,440
and they actually encouraged it.

843
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,960
But as everyone took a
little piece with them,

844
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,190
the 10 Cadillacs became
almost unrecognizable.

845
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:59,680
Only their carcasses
remain, stained by graffiti.

846
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,580
In fact, they've been in the ground

847
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,640
longer that they've been on the road.

848
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,170
The art piece is now seen

849
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:08,290
to represent America's hopes and dreams,

850
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:12,510
art and commerce,
materialism and spiritualism,

851
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,115
all the infame.

852
00:45:14,115 --> 00:45:17,365
(upbeat strings music)

853
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,910
The last place in Texas worth seeing

854
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:28,653
is the Midpoint Cafe
in the town of Adrian.

855
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,370
- We're famous for the pies,

856
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:36,000
and I think, very friendly people.

857
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,020
We try to make everybody feel like

858
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,230
they're special when
they come to the door.

859
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:42,340
(laughing) Yeah, and we
have a great gift shop,

860
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,470
and you can get pretty
much find anything you want

861
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:46,610
at Route 66 here in the Midpoint Cafe

862
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,710
or the midpoint period.

863
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:52,770
There's great photo-ops
here, and good food.

864
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:54,870
- Yeah, and great food, yeah (laughs).

865
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:57,197
They bring a lot of fun,
that's what I think (laughs).

866
00:45:58,744 --> 00:46:00,740
We enjoy visiting with them
and having a good time.

867
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,300
And that we do, it's like a great job.

868
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,256
We literally have fun everyday.

869
00:46:05,256 --> 00:46:07,839
(upbeat music)

870
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,480
- [Narrator] The first break
in the state of New Mexico

871
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,690
could easily be at night.

872
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:39,410
The Blue Swallow motel is a must-stop,

873
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:41,420
if it isn't for the kitsch in the outside

874
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,017
that lights up the night.

875
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:50,490
Originally built in 1939,

876
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:54,580
it keeps up with the original
style inside and out.

877
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,176
It feels like a walk back in time.

878
00:46:57,176 --> 00:46:59,759
(upbeat music)

879
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:20,040
Near Grant, we stumble
upon a treasure trove

880
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,823
of classic cars waiting to be refurbished.

881
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:29,710
An incredible selection,
from Chevys to Fords,

882
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:33,083
and a few imports like the
famous Volkswagen Beetle.

883
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:39,010
Any classic car enthusiast would revel

884
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:41,960
in such a sight, with hundreds of vehicles

885
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,209
as far as the eye can see.

886
00:47:44,209 --> 00:47:46,792
(upbeat music)

887
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,590
A quick stop before hitting
the road with Big Brown

888
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:01,240
for a small transmission tune up.

889
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,640
As always, the people along Route 66

890
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,137
are always friendly and helpful.

891
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:09,720
(upbeat music)

892
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:23,616
15 minutes later, we're ready to roll.

893
00:48:23,616 --> 00:48:26,199
(upbeat music)

894
00:48:32,545 --> 00:48:34,970
Making its way towards Arizona,

895
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:36,710
Big Brown makes one last stop

896
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:38,170
in the state of New Mexico,

897
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:40,593
in Gallup, at El Rancho Hotel.

898
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:44,180
El Rancho was built in 1937,

899
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,120
originally as a base camp for movie stars.

900
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,780
Brother of film director
David Wark Griffith

901
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,560
built it to accommodate actors

902
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,442
when they were shooting
films in the wild west.

903
00:48:54,442 --> 00:48:57,025
(mellow music)

904
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:04,350
During the 30s and 40s, 100 western films

905
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:06,140
were filmed around Gallup,

906
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,853
with their stars staying at the El Rancho.

907
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:13,030
Guests included stars
such as Ronald Reagan,

908
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,880
Humphrey Bogart, Katharine Hepburn,

909
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,913
May West, and over 150 others.

910
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,760
The place still looks and feels

911
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,770
as it did back in the day.

912
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:26,353
(mellow music)

913
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:32,140
In Arizona, the state best
known for the Grand Canyon,

914
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,800
hidden gems reside along Route 66.

915
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,450
The Wigwam Motel, a
distinctive historical landmark

916
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:42,850
built along Route 66 in
Holbrook, was built in 1950,

917
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:45,792
one of seven Wigmam Villages.

918
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:48,375
(upbeat music)

919
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,920
The units are teepee-shaped,

920
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,200
but were mistakenly named wigwams.

921
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,340
The Pixar film Car Story is entirely based

922
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:01,060
on the Route 66 experience,
and one of the characters

923
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:04,430
owns a motel called the Cozy Cone Motel,

924
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:07,280
which is clearly inspired
by the Wigwam Village

925
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,268
in Holbrook, Arizona.

926
00:51:09,268 --> 00:51:11,851
(upbeat music)

927
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:17,950
The first Wigwam Village was
built in 1933 by Frank Redford.

928
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:22,380
It was located on the corner of US 31E

929
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:25,750
and Highway 218 in Horse Cave, Kentucky.

930
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,240
Redford created the village

931
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,240
after adding teepee-shaped units

932
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,010
around a museum-cum-shop
he had built to store

933
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:35,060
his collection of Native
American artifacts.

934
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,990
He applied for a patent
on the ornamental design

935
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:42,440
of the teepees, and was
granted design patent in 1936.

936
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,580
The original drawing includes a swastika,

937
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:49,320
at the time, a symbol
associated with Native Americans

938
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,181
or often often worn as a good luck charm.

939
00:51:52,181 --> 00:51:54,764
(upbeat music)

940
00:51:59,398 --> 00:52:04,398
For all the Eagles fans, the
best spot to stop on Highway 66

941
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,803
is on the corner in Winslow, Arizona.

942
00:52:07,649 --> 00:52:10,590
The English setting of
the Take it Easy song

943
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:13,780
of the famous rock band,
Standin' On The Corner Park,

944
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,663
has become a tourist attraction.

945
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:19,970
The town of Winslow used to be

946
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,090
the biggest town in the state of Arizona.

947
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:24,420
That is, up until the late 1970s.

948
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,870
When the town was bypassed

949
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:28,640
by the new transcontinental highway,

950
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,020
tourism-based businesses
downtown closed up shop,

951
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,020
and for the following 20 years,

952
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,240
the town was frozen in time.

953
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,760
All of this changed when in 1994,

954
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,070
La Posada Foundation put efforts

955
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:44,260
into refurbishing the La Posada Hotel,

956
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,580
a hotel built in 1930.

957
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,000
This revived the town.

958
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,670
Seeing the success it
had brought to the town,

959
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:53,460
La Posada Foundation changed its name

960
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,640
to Standin' On The Corner Foundation,

961
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,500
and decided to build a park

962
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,800
dedicated to the Eagles song.

963
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,250
They hired artists to paint a mural

964
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,070
and make a sculpture of a man

965
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:06,563
standing on the corner of the park.

966
00:53:06,563 --> 00:53:09,146
(upbeat music)

967
00:53:36,526 --> 00:53:39,680
About 177 kilometers down Route 66

968
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,220
is another historic
eatery called Delgadillos

969
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,280
Snow Cap drive-in in Seligman, Arizona.

970
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,910
The drive-in was built in 1953

971
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:52,040
by local resident Juan Delgadillo.

972
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:56,100
Delgadillo built the restaurant
mostly from scrap lumber

973
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,500
obtained from the nearby
Santa Fe railroad yard

974
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:03,200
because he was working on
an extremely tight budget.

975
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,540
John Delgadillo, son of Juan Delgadillo,

976
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,640
tells us more about his
family and the drive-in.

977
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,460
- My father built it with his father

978
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,833
and his brothers in 1953.

979
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,093
He opened in June of 53.

980
00:54:20,179 --> 00:54:21,729
And we've been here ever since.

981
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,473
- [Narrator] Juan
Delgadillo's brother owned

982
00:54:24,473 --> 00:54:28,560
a 1936 Chevrolet hard
top and cut the roof off,

983
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,970
adorned the vehicle with paint, horns,

984
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:33,630
and various other items,

985
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:35,980
including an artificial Christmas tree

986
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,430
in the rear of the car.

987
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:39,950
And they would it around
to attract customers

988
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:41,510
to the restaurant.

989
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:44,760
The old Chevy is still
there parked in front.

990
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,220
Today, people come from all over the world

991
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:50,360
and stop at Delgadillo's Snow Cap drive-in

992
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,720
for the 30s and 40s experience.

993
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,410
Part of the service at the
drive-in are the jokes.

994
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,910
There are jokes for everything you order,

995
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:00,750
which extends to the building itself.

996
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,240
The restaurant is filled
with humorous decor

997
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,160
and comical phrases.

998
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,740
In the back of the restaurant,

999
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:09,330
there is a collection of old automobiles,

1000
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:12,010
which has its humorous touch as well.

1001
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:15,333
Nevertheless, running a
drive-in is a lot of work.

1002
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,520
- It's work, a lot of work,

1003
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,850
and talking to people,
having fun with people,

1004
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:24,250
because they come back,
they bring their family,

1005
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:27,500
they bring their friends,
because we have fun with them.

1006
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,070
- [Narrator] At Delgadillo's
Snow Cap drive-in,

1007
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:31,870
it's the perfect place for someone

1008
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,430
with a good sense of humor

1009
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,283
and an appetite for great food.

1010
00:55:35,283 --> 00:55:37,866
(upbeat music)

1011
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,170
The last stop in Arizona

1012
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:09,640
is at the El Trovatore Motel in Kingman.

1013
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:13,430
This historic Route 66
motel started in 1937

1014
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:15,080
as a service station,

1015
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,600
with a tourist court added later in 1939,

1016
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,930
and was first owned by John F. Miller.

1017
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:22,910
You can spend the night

1018
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:25,290
in the motel's Hollywood-themed rooms,

1019
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:29,010
which remain in the original
decor of when it was built.

1020
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:32,020
Mr. Fisher knows exactly
what Route 66 today

1021
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:36,238
is all about and why it
remains an iconic route.

1022
00:56:36,238 --> 00:56:39,830
- People come here for
their bucket list 66.

1023
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:44,020
Let's say, younger people
will come here to do this.

1024
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:46,047
Older people come here and say,

1025
00:56:46,047 --> 00:56:49,357
"We used to drive the station
wagon with my grandfather

1026
00:56:49,357 --> 00:56:51,760
"all the way across Route 66."

1027
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,440
And the original people
that left Oklahoma,

1028
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,840
because they lost their farms,

1029
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,420
because they (mumbles) the field too much,

1030
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,020
and they drove across Route 66

1031
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:05,500
to California for a better life.

1032
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,910
So that's a part of Route 66.

1033
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:09,270
- [Narrator] In the town of Kingman,

1034
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:12,090
classic cars are not uncommon.

1035
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:15,373
- Just in this town alone,
there is over 350 classic cars.

1036
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:21,360
Once a month, they go to
downtown and they drive around

1037
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,650
in procession like this for four hours.

1038
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,910
It's called Chill on Beale.

1039
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:29,380
Once a year, there's a
thousand cars come on Route 66.

1040
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,000
They do a fun run.

1041
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,180
But every few months,
there's another group

1042
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,610
come here from Australia, New Zealand,

1043
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:40,320
either with motorcycles,
and it's fun to be here.

1044
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:41,743
It's fun to meet the people.

1045
00:57:43,610 --> 00:57:45,930
The fun part was not remodeling it,

1046
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:47,030
doing all this work.

1047
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:50,540
The fun part is meeting people

1048
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:55,540
that have in their eyes,
this yearning to see this,

1049
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:57,857
and they come all the way from

1050
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:01,510
the Czech Republic.

1051
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,530
Why would they want to come here?

1052
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:05,452
That's because there is a road like this.

1053
00:58:05,452 --> 00:58:08,702
(mellow strings music)

1054
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:40,190
- [Narrator] Reaching the Black Mountains

1055
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:42,250
of Mohave County, Arizona,

1056
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:44,443
a small town resides called the Oatman.

1057
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:47,780
The town started as a small mining camp

1058
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:49,780
soon after two prospectors tracked

1059
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:51,773
a $10-million gold mine.

1060
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,330
The town was named Oatman
in honor of Olive Oatman,

1061
00:58:57,330 --> 00:59:00,120
a young Illinois girl who
had been taken captive

1062
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,660
by Indians during her pioneer
family's journey westward

1063
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:06,810
in 1851, and forced into slavery.

1064
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:09,400
She was later traded to Mohave Indians

1065
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,260
who adopted her as a daughter

1066
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:14,840
and had her face tattooed
in the custom of the tribe.

1067
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:19,045
She was released in 1856
at Fort Yuma, Arizona.

1068
00:59:19,045 --> 00:59:23,619
(firing)
(clamoring)

1069
00:59:23,619 --> 00:59:26,786
(upbeat guitar music)

1070
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,240
After the district had
produced 40 million,

1071
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,127
or approximately 2.6 billion

1072
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:37,560
in today's market price in gold by 1941,

1073
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,250
all of the gold extracting
operations ceased,

1074
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,360
and the town changed its business

1075
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,347
to cater to travelers on Route 66.

1076
00:59:45,347 --> 00:59:48,514
(upbeat guitar music)

1077
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,710
In 1953, the new highway was built

1078
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:55,250
and bypassed the town,

1079
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:58,000
and Oatman was all but abandoned.

1080
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,420
But as Route 66 gained
recognition worldwide,

1081
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,000
Oatman revived.

1082
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,160
It is well-known for its wild burrows

1083
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,720
wandering the streets,

1084
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,570
the descendants of pack animals

1085
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:12,270
abandoned by early
prospectors in Sitgreaves Pass

1086
01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:15,063
which tops out at 3,550 feet.

1087
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,810
The pass was named after
Captain Lorenzo Sitgreaves,

1088
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:22,700
who traveled through the area in 1851.

1089
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,610
Old Route 66 did not cut through the land.

1090
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:29,023
It moved with the land,
unlike the new interstate.

1091
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:35,480
The last state sliced by the pavement

1092
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,020
of the Mother Road is California,

1093
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:40,110
gifted with spectacular scenery,

1094
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:42,253
diversity, and wonderful weather.

1095
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:46,790
It is best known for its
standing in show business,

1096
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:49,460
its premises filled with movie stars,

1097
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,713
musical artists, and popular culture.

1098
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:56,991
It is a place where dreams
come to life for many.

1099
01:00:56,991 --> 01:01:00,010
(upbeat music)

1100
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:03,000
The first stop in California
is Elmer's Bottle Tree

1101
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,920
in Oro Grande.

1102
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,390
Elmer Long's two plus acres are crowded

1103
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:09,210
with hundreds of metal sculptures

1104
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:11,050
adorned with colored bottles,

1105
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:13,863
and just about anything
else one could imagine.

1106
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:19,823
Elmer was only a boy when he
started collecting bottles.

1107
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:25,170
He found a dump with trash
that went back to the 1800s.

1108
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:26,970
And as far as Elmer could tell,

1109
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:29,910
the stuff he found in them were priceless,

1110
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:31,133
which included bottles.

1111
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:35,310
Elmer has been collecting
bottles for years

1112
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:36,910
and found a way to display them.

1113
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:40,190
It started with one bottle tree.

1114
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:43,321
Now, hundreds are planted on his land.

1115
01:01:43,321 --> 01:01:45,904
(upbeat music)

1116
01:01:56,962 --> 01:02:00,129
(pensive piano music)

1117
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:14,943
At the pier is the Pacific Park.

1118
01:02:16,956 --> 01:02:20,123
(pensive piano music)

1119
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,833
Several restaurants and
loads of smiles and fun.

1120
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:33,390
You've reached the finish line,

1121
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:36,036
but the fun does not have to end there.

1122
01:02:36,036 --> 01:02:41,036
(people squealing)
(pensive piano music)

1123
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:56,530
Driving down Route 66 makes
for a humbling experience.

1124
01:02:56,530 --> 01:02:59,463
It shows you that happiness
is in the little things.

1125
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:03,690
People don't go through
Route 66 to make good time.

1126
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:06,040
They go through it to have a good time.

1127
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:10,065
And once in a while, it's
kind of nice to slow down.

1128
01:03:10,065 --> 01:03:13,648
(lighthearted piano music)
