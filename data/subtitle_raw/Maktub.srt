1
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:47,500
No way...

2
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:51,000
I need your opinion on this, Chuma.

3
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:58,417
It's sweet?

4
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:02,958
Why is the Carpaccio sweet?

5
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,583
Do you serve it for dessert?

6
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,125
No, it's... an appetizer.

7
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,625
You used to serve the Carpaccio
with balsamic vinegar.

8
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,417
- What is this?
- This is...

9
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,250
pomegranate concentrate.

10
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:18,708
Awful.

11
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,458
Pomegranate concentrate
on raw meat?

12
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,667
Is this about food costs?

13
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,333
It doesn't make sense.

14
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:29,833
Concentrate costs more than balsamic.

15
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:32,208
At least seven cents more per 100 ml.

16
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:34,708
Okay, but it's concentrate.

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,917
You use less...

18
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,208
No, it's not about food costs.

19
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:43,042
It's the new chef, my new partner,

20
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:45,708
he makes the rules in the kitchen.

21
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:48,167
It's his culinary concept,

22
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,458
a twist in every dish.

23
00:02:56,167 --> 00:02:57,042
You got it, Steve?

24
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,833
Sure. A twist.

25
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,750
Now I get what happened
to the Caprese salad.

26
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,833
Mozzarella is bland,

27
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,875
at least the buffalo cheese
gave it some presence.

28
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:10,250
It's a shame,

29
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:13,083
you pay us a lot of money
for our advice.

30
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:15,500
This man has the palate
of a master chef.

31
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,792
Please...

32
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,208
I give credit where it's due.

33
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:21,167
I appreciate that.

34
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:25,333
So earn it at least.

35
00:03:25,917 --> 00:03:28,208
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

36
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,333
The new partner, the chef?

37
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,250
He wants to make changes in...

38
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,375
I think...

39
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,000
He said...

40
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,750
you should talk to him.

41
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:42,125
Then get him out here.

42
00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:44,833
We won't take up
too much of his time.

43
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:53,375
Tell Yiftach to come out here.

44
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,542
Yiftach...

45
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,708
Why does that name sound familiar?

46
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:00,458
I'll tell you why.

47
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,333
It's from my Bar Mitzvah portion.

48
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:04,625
Judges 11.

49
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,917
"Yiftach the Gileadite.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,625
was a mighty man of valor,

51
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,792
and he was the son of a harlot."

52
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,333
The son of a harlot?

53
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:21,375
How's it going, Mickey?

54
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:22,625
Are these your friends?

55
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,542
Please, join us,

56
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,208
we just tasted the dessert.

57
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,917
I don't know if Mickey told you,

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,333
but this is my place now.

59
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:32,875
So, thank you
for all your culinary advice,

60
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,292
but our business relationship...

61
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,708
is over.

62
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,208
It pains us to hear that.

63
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,583
This place is so precious to us.

64
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,208
Bring us the pomegranate concentrate.
Quickly.

65
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,875
Now do you get why meat
and pomegranate concentrate

66
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,833
- is a shitty twist?
- Okay, I get it.

67
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,583
- I get it, don't kill him.
- God forbid.

68
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:55,458
Kill him? What are we, animals?

69
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,125
Do you know why Dori
isn't at practice?

70
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,583
Did his mom catch him cheating on a test?

71
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:15,458
No, you idiot, they went to America.

72
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,250
- Where'd they get the money?
- Didn't you hear? They won.

73
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,958
His father won the first prize.
Two million.

74
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:21,917
What?

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,792
- Swear on your mom.
- I swear.

76
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:27,000
I heard Zion say Dori put a note
with a wish in the Western Wall.

77
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,292
- You think that's why he won?
- Of course.

78
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,583
If you're a good person and you
put a wish in the Wall, it comes true.

79
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,500
Everyone gather round.

80
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,208
Sit down.

81
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:52,417
Listen up, our first championship game
is in Kiryat Shmona.

82
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,958
- Yes!
- Yes!

83
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,000
Yes? Yes? Settle down.

84
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,833
First you win,
then you shout "Yes!"

85
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,875
We're taking one bus to the game

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,583
because it's very expensive,

87
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:05,833
so whoever knows his dad will come,

88
00:07:05,917 --> 00:07:06,792
raise your hand.

89
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:10,625
Write the names.
Rani's dad, Shmueli's dad,

90
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,167
Balahsan's dad,
Saado's dad...

91
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:19,167
- Avisar, did you raise your hand?
- Yes.

92
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:24,250
- Who's gonna come, your mom?
- No, my dad.

93
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:28,917
- How is that possible?
- Stop it.

94
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,958
- Yigal, are you writing me name?
- Yes.

95
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:35,250
Stop it, Shmuel,
where's your sensitivity?

96
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:37,167
I wrote it down.

97
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,042
Okay, hands back up.

98
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,375
Dvir David's dad, Orian's dad...

99
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,083
Gazala's dad.

100
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,833
This respect we're getting
is reserved for prime ministers.

101
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,583
And what's wrong with that?

102
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:04,417
- I sense a dissonance.
- Give it to me straight.

103
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,583
Every collection round like this,
we make a few hundred thousand.

104
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:10,833
You'd think our share would be 50%.

105
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:13,917
But it all goes to him.
How can I grow like this?

106
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,667
There's this armored glass ceiling.

107
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,542
What are you going on about?

108
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,667
You want Kadaev to tell Kaslassy?

109
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,333
He won't say a word,
he doesn't know the lingo.

110
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:24,375
He knows the lingo
better than you think.

111
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:33,583
Besides, what do you want?
You got it so bad?

112
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:37,250
You got respect, food, a bed,

113
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,458
a kid...

114
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,208
Shut up.

115
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,500
GOD MAKE MY DAD COME BACK.

116
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,583
Avisar!

117
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:07,000
Come play!

118
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:19,750
Thank you.

119
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,083
Yikes!

120
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,958
Where did that come from?

121
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,333
I bet a crow
stole that fish from Ziko.

122
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,167
Fuck, let's get outta here,

123
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,917
we'll get their money tomorrow.

124
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,875
What's the matter?

125
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,333
A crow dropping a fish
is a bad sign.

126
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:38,833
You starting with that again?

127
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:40,292
I'm telling you, it's a bad sign.

128
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,750
Come on, Chuma, we're already here,
let's get this over with.

129
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,875
Kadaev, the door.

130
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:00,667
The way you abuse your food
is very disappointing.

131
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,083
You're turning it all into one color.

132
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:04,250
You're killing it.

133
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,750
It's not one color,
it's a specific color.

134
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:08,500
I like my food spicy.

135
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,750
Hello. How are you?

136
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,167
Are you enjoying your meal?

137
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,708
Any better than this
and we'd go insane.

138
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:19,750
Would you like a cocktail?

139
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,958
You know what?
I was thinking of a Gewurtz.

140
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:26,125
Listen, there's a problem
with the bread.

141
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,667
What... what's the problem?

142
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,542
We keep running out of it.

143
00:10:52,042 --> 00:10:52,875
What's that?

144
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:54,917
It's a potato.

145
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,542
No, on your shirt.

146
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,333
Fuckin' shit! It's blood!

147
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,458
It's a stain.

148
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:03,417
You hit him too hard,

149
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,250
that fuckin' Yiftach son of a harlot.

150
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,667
It's not blood, it's concentrate.

151
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,958
You poured it on his head...

152
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,292
Fuck, my day is shot.

153
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,833
It's a stain, it's blood!

154
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,167
- No, it's concentrate.
- It's red! Blood!

155
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,875
Concentrate is purplish.

156
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,542
This is a Pierre Cardin shirt!

157
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:26,417
You know what? Let's check it out.
If you're right, I'll buy you a shirt.

158
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,167
If you're wrong,
I want a huge bag of gummy worms.

159
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,667
- Kadaev, what are you doing here?
- Get the hell out!

160
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:35,958
What are you doing here
with that briefcase? Go!

161
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:38,958
Kadaev hungry. Finish round.

162
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,750
Go buy yourself a falafel.

163
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,875
Forget it, he might as well eat here,

164
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,750
We're going to check the stain anyways.

165
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,375
Kadaev, sit,

166
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,833
Eat... fast.

167
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,042
Thank you.

168
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:58,500
You see, it's concentrate.

169
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,667
Maybe soda gets blood out?

170
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,083
You said that blood
never comes out.

171
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,542
Don't "Soda" me.

172
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:08,042
You owe me.

173
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,875
What?

174
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,875
What's this?

175
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,750
Weird...

176
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,083
How lucky are we?

177
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,417
Everyone died.

178
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,875
The restaurant went kaput.

179
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,458
Did you see what was left of Kadaev?
Shoes.

180
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,875
As if the terrorist was hugging him.

181
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,667
We have to give thanks,
but not in synagogue,

182
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,125
at the Wailing Wall.

183
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,417
A dining hall?
But you just ate!

184
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:34,875
How can you even think of food?

185
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,542
We gotta go to the Wailing Wall
to give thanks.

186
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,417
Fine, that's what I said.

187
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:42,750
Come on, let's go.

188
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,125
Let's go then.

189
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,333
Oh my God...

190
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,542
Chuma, your ear is bleeding.

191
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,167
Chuma.

192
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,375
Friend, give me a pen.

193
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,042
Chuma,

194
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,500
your ear is bleeding.

195
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,042
You can't hear.

196
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,208
Because we weren't listening...
it's a sign.

197
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:51,208
We have to leave this business.

198
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,083
There was a terrorist attack
at Zairi's restaurant.

199
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,542
We were there
when we were making collections.

200
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,875
People died in there.

201
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,500
You mean you were there
when the place was blown up?

202
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:14,875
Yes.

203
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,042
Where's my money?

204
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:21,292
I dunno, Kadaev must have it.

205
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,083
Where's Kadaev?

206
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,958
We were doing our thing,
we were inside,

207
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:37,917
he was outside with the...
money.

208
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,625
We never hang on
to the briefcase.

209
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,542
I bet the explosion scared him
and he took off.

210
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,542
I was sure he's here
with the money.

211
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:48,875
And you didn't see him
after the explosion?

212
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:50,958
No.

213
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,750
How did you get out
without a scratch?

214
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,000
Without a scratch, Kaslassy?

215
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:03,583
Did you see Chuma?

216
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:07,375
The man's deaf,
he's totally lost it.

217
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:12,250
I'm telling you, we talked about it,

218
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,958
we can't go on like this...

219
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,875
We want out.

220
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,375
You want out?

221
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:24,208
What is this, summer camp?

222
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:27,500
We've changed.

223
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,458
This kind of thing
gives you perspective,

224
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,875
all I see before my eyes
is blood.

225
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,792
You see blood on a daily basis,

226
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,917
- what are you going on about?
- But this is different, Kaslassy.

227
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,375
There were families, kids...

228
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,917
You know us, we're no softies.

229
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,125
Fine. Enough.

230
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,542
Take an unpaid leave.

231
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,333
You're not leaving,
you're getting some R&R.

232
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,667
We'll talk when you get back.

233
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,083
Thank you, Kaslassy.

234
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
You believe him?

235
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:10,083
You can't make up
something like that.

236
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,375
Yeah, they're not smart enough to lie.

237
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:16,958
How sad. Kids got killed...

238
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,833
That motherfuckin' Kadaev.

239
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:25,875
Three.

240
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:27,667
Tongue.

241
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,167
- Words.
- Words.

242
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:33,667
Kadaev?

243
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:36,667
Ran off?

244
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,250
With the money?

245
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,458
Indeed.
- Is that what you told him?

246
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:44,125
He'll find out
he died in the attack,

247
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,917
- his body was all over the restaurant.
- No he won't.

248
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,625
That Chechen wasn't legal,
no documents, no nothing.

249
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,458
He even looked Muslim,
they'll think he was the terrorist.

250
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:54,000
Don't worry, I thought of everything.

251
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,458
This is bad money! It's bad karma

252
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,917
and you're stealing it? From him?

253
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:01,833
This is not stolen money.

254
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:03,542
It's our retirement fund.

255
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,083
You wanted to retire, fine,
but we need some cash

256
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:09,292
to get on our feet, especially
after what we've been through.

257
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:13,167
So let's take the money
and go to New York, to Zadok.

258
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,833
We'll partner with him
in his food trucks.

259
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:17,458
You know how much he makes
on his hummus shakshuka?

260
00:18:17,542 --> 00:18:19,500
And it's a culinary disaster to boot!

261
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,458
Who mixes shakshuka with hummus?

262
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:23,042
You know what we can do there?

263
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,417
We'll burn America with our food truck.

264
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,583
Picture it, "Fish Kebab."

265
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:31,875
I didn't get it, what?

266
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,042
Let's go to Zadok...

267
00:18:42,542 --> 00:18:46,292
with our "Fish Kebab."

268
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,083
"God...

269
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,250
my wife and I are having a hard time,

270
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,375
I don't meet her expectations.

271
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:22,042
I do what I can, I work 17 hours a day,

272
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,542
I make food for the kids,

273
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,000
I can't do it anymore.

274
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,542
Help me restore the spark
to Varda's eyes?

275
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:34,208
Achikam Shem-Tov,
son of Dvora and Ephraim Shem-Tov."

276
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:36,667
Where'd you find this?

277
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:40,708
In my pocket.

278
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:45,042
- Is this from the Wailing Wall?
- Yeah, I... tried to talk to you,

279
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,583
you couldn't hear me,
I looked for something to write on,

280
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:48,917
so I pulled out that note.

281
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,083
I tried to talk to you! I had to...

282
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,625
Don't get upset.

283
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:02,125
Let's find the guy and help him.

284
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,667
We have the money to help, okay?

285
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,875
Okay.

286
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,542
"Okay?"

287
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:12,042
You mean you heard me?

288
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:18,833
I don't believe it,
my ear's unclogged.

289
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:20,792
For real?

290
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:30,500
Why did my ear come unclogged

291
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:34,458
just when you said we'd help him?

292
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:37,333
I hear you...

293
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:39,083
Think about it.

294
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,375
You were going on
about the fish kebab...

295
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,667
but when you said
let's help him with the money...

296
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:46,917
It came unclogged.

297
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,917
The problem is, how do we restore
the spark to Varda's eyes.

298
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:58,292
- You only read what he wrote.
- So?

299
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,625
You didn't read what wasn't written.

300
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,583
"I make food for the kids."

301
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:04,292
What do you learn from that?

302
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,708
That he can cook.

303
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,083
That he takes part in raising...

304
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:10,375
That's the obvious answer.

305
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,625
What's the hidden meaning?

306
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:13,958
Grilled cheese?

307
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:18,000
Kids, in the plural. Not one kid.

308
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,833
He has to support them,
he has to feed them.

309
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:22,417
Just to prove to you, he also writes

310
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,917
"I work 17 hours a day."
You see, the dude doesn't rest.

311
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,125
And still she's not happy with him.
Why?

312
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,375
Money! He doesn't make enough.

313
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,583
Increase his salary,
reduce his work hours,

314
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:39,500
the spark will come back,

315
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:41,417
so will the respect.

316
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:42,667
The love.

317
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:46,042
Maybe they'll even have
another kid.

318
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,292
It's important for the kids.
They need their parents.

319
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,167
Why did you have to say that?

320
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:18,625
Achikam Shem-Tov?

321
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:19,917
- What?
- Did you write this?

322
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:29,542
I don't know.
What do you want?

323
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:32,958
Don't freak out, we're here to help.
Now answer the question.

324
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:37,333
Don't lie.
Chuma will beat you up.

325
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,542
Yes, I wrote it.
I'm sorry, I...

326
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:44,292
- Take us to the manager.
- We can't just walk in on him.

327
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,667
We shall see about that.

328
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:51,167
Can't you just say,
"We'll see about that?"

329
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,167
It's more memorable.

330
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:01,792
I'll get back to you.

331
00:23:04,167 --> 00:23:05,042
What?

332
00:23:06,792 --> 00:23:08,958
We're good friends
of Achikam Shem-Tov.

333
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:11,542
We want you to give him a raise.

334
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:14,083
A raise for Achikam...

335
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:16,917
Get the hell outta here.

336
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,667
Before I call the cops.

337
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:24,250
Out!

338
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,500
No! No!

339
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:53,583
Let me up!

340
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:57,625
Take her to a nice restaurant.

341
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:00,250
You can order fried risotto balls

342
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:02,458
with cheese for the appetizer.

343
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:04,708
They're crispy and soft.

344
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:07,333
For the first coursethey should
share a fillet of bass,

345
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:10,042
without the bones.

346
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:14,083
And then for dessert,
take her to Cafe Rimon,

347
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,167
Order some Napoleon cake.

348
00:24:17,167 --> 00:24:18,375
Give her back the spark.

349
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,083
I don't know how to thank you.

350
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:32,708
There is a God in heaven.

351
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:36,375
I knew angels existed,
but I didn't imagine them...

352
00:24:39,917 --> 00:24:40,792
you know...

353
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,500
You're welcome.

354
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:47,708
Thank you.

355
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:50,042
Where are you going?

356
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:52,125
Go home!

357
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:07,917
What a great feeling.

358
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,125
Amazing.

359
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:13,292
I'd love to be a fly on the wall
when he shows his wife the raise.

360
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:15,958
You just gave me the chills.

361
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:18,458
Me too.

362
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,333
Two.

363
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,167
Three.

364
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:33,292
Four.

365
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:38,000
Five!

366
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,333
Five white cars in a row.

367
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:43,083
I said if one white car goes by...
then five will go by.

368
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:44,875
Who did you say it to?

369
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:46,542
To myself.

370
00:25:47,833 --> 00:25:48,792
Forget that.

371
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:51,583
Zadok got back to me...

372
00:25:52,458 --> 00:25:54,500
He called from some parking lot
in New Jersey.

373
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:56,333
You say Zadok
and a jackass walks by.

374
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:59,625
Forget that. Listen to me!

375
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,583
He catered this Betty Perry gig,

376
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,667
he sold 1,500 portions
of humshuka in four hours.

377
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,125
You know how much
he sells a portion for?

378
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,625
Eight dollars and fifty cents.

379
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:12,792
And what expenses does he have?

380
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:14,792
Even if you count everything,

381
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:17,917
Maybe 2.3 dollars per portion.

382
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,458
You know how much
that leaves him with?

383
00:26:23,042 --> 00:26:26,708
6.2 dollars per portion.
Multiply that by 1500.

384
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:28,667
- How much does he make?
- 9300.

385
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,583
9300 dollars in four hours.

386
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:37,292
See what I mean?

387
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,875
He says that with our money

388
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,750
we can take on our own food truck.

389
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:45,667
And he'll be our partner, 50%.

390
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:47,958
Steve, what are you doing?

391
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:51,208
I get what you're about,
no more Kaslassy,

392
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:52,542
you want to be your own man.

393
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:53,667
I took care of us.

394
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,292
You took care of yourself.

395
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:56,708
Why are you being like that?

396
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:59,500
Because I don't want to go to Zadok
and sell fish kebab.

397
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:01,208
The food truck is your dream.

398
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:02,708
I got all the answers.

399
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:04,167
You wanna keep playing?

400
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,583
What answers did you get, Chuma?

401
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,708
Who did you get answers from?

402
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:10,708
The five white cars that drove by?

403
00:27:10,792 --> 00:27:12,000
Are you a little kid?

404
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,875
Keep putting me down, why don't you?

405
00:27:13,958 --> 00:27:15,708
I'm not, I really want to know.

406
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:17,750
What do you want to do?

407
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:22,500
I want to read another note.

408
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,333
You opened one!

409
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:29,167
We paid back our debt to society,
we're even.

410
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:30,208
Even?

411
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:32,583
This look like a game to you?
You have to give back all your life.

412
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:35,625
All my life?! Then how will we live?
I don't get you!

413
00:27:35,708 --> 00:27:38,750
We were supposed to be dead
but we're alive.

414
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:41,083
We'll do what we gotta do,
with God's help.

415
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,042
You really do need God's help.

416
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,583
Hey, sit down, we're playing a game.

417
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,042
- Forget about it.
- Chuma!

418
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:52,167
Forget it.

419
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:55,417
Chuma!

420
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,417
Don't follow me.

421
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,375
Go to Jersey, make fish kebab.

422
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:00,333
Are you a pussy?

423
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:01,583
I'm going it on my own.

424
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:02,833
Get back here, Chuma!

425
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,292
Fine, I won't get back to Zadok.

426
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:09,333
Fifty percent is too much anyway.

427
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:10,833
But just think about it, okay?

428
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:15,292
Meanwhile, I'm with you.
Let's get another note.

429
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:16,458
Only one?

430
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:17,875
What do you want?

431
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:19,250
I don't want one more.

432
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:23,667
Come back and have a beer with me.

433
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,792
I'm in a hurry.

434
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:35,375
Play me something tender.

435
00:28:47,417 --> 00:28:50,292
You see, Avisar?
When there's a corner kick,

436
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:54,333
the center back
runs to the closest post.

437
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,708
That's your responsibility.
You get me?

438
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:58,375
Yes.

439
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:02,500
What's that scratch on your head?

440
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:03,625
Did you get hit?

441
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,042
No, I got brains.

442
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,667
This guy cracked my head open,

443
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:11,708
shoved brains inside
and closed me up.

444
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:12,875
Now I'm much smarter.

445
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,125
You're making that up.

446
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:18,125
Close your eyes.

447
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:25,792
This is for you.

448
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:29,625
- You mean it?
- Yes.

449
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,667
- What is it?
- Look.

450
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:34,542
It's a crown.

451
00:29:35,125 --> 00:29:36,125
The crown of a king.

452
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:38,958
You can put it around your neck

453
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:41,083
and everyone will know
that you're a king.

454
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:42,958
Gimme your hand.

455
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:53,083
Only special people have one.

456
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,208
It's not for just anyone.

457
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:57,792
And if you meet someone

458
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:59,208
who has one just like it,

459
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,958
you'll know that person
is special like you.

460
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:07,958
Sweetheart.

461
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:14,083
Your mom's coming.

462
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:15,625
Go to your room, quickly!

463
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,375
How did it go?

464
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,375
Did he wake up?

465
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,583
No, he's sleeping soundly.

466
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:40,875
- How was your evening?
- These blind dates aren't for me.

467
00:30:41,417 --> 00:30:43,125
He sends me a photo of Raj Kapoor

468
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,042
and a loan shark turns up.

469
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:53,208
You're better off
without those goofballs.

470
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,958
Stay. Let's watch a movie.

471
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:59,833
No, I can't,
I have a busy day tomorrow.

472
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,958
Thanks, Chuma.

473
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:08,250
I know you don't have to do this.

474
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,250
Nonsense,
what else am I gonna do?

475
00:31:15,833 --> 00:31:17,458
- Okay then, bye.
- Bye.

476
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:30,583
Is it okay that I'm blond
or do you prefer dark hair?

477
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:36,042
I didn't say, I'm Freddy.

478
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:39,208
Yes, I'm not from here.

479
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,542
Excuse me.

480
00:31:43,542 --> 00:31:45,125
From Netanya?

481
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:47,208
That's a great city.

482
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,875
There's a port, isn't there?

483
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
Take me to the Chechen's room!

484
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,542
I'll call you back.

485
00:32:03,583 --> 00:32:04,958
What's this stench?

486
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:11,625
Seems to be the stench of a corpse.

487
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:16,083
He hasn't been there in a while.

488
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,125
How do you know?

489
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:20,958
The fridge reeked like a carcass.
It wasn't working for three days.

490
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:23,917
There was this huge fish in there,

491
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,750
he wouldn't have let it go bad.

492
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:27,708
I bet he wanted to smoke it.

493
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:30,458
Are you hungry, bro?

494
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:34,667
Motherfucker.

495
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:37,042
The European guy that works there

496
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:38,917
said he hasn't seen him.

497
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:43,958
- You want me to deal with him?
- No.

498
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,292
So what are you saying?

499
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:51,625
My gut tells me
he bailed with the money,

500
00:32:51,833 --> 00:32:54,583
- to Chechnya.
- Your gut won't stop talking.

501
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:55,667
What can I do?

502
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,208
I wanted to eat a pastry,
but the place was closed.

503
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:06,125
How did he take off to Chechnya
if we have his passport?

504
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,875
With the money he had,

505
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:10,083
he could print passports
for the entire family.

506
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:13,167
I bet he's eating a seven course meal

507
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,208
as we speak.

508
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:27,250
Just my luck. I never win anything.

509
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:29,542
Not even free french fries.

510
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,792
You look nice,

511
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:35,958
and the eyeliner came out perfect.

512
00:33:36,042 --> 00:33:38,375
Go to hell.
I don't even get why I'm doing this.

513
00:33:38,458 --> 00:33:39,708
What don't you get?

514
00:33:39,792 --> 00:33:41,708
This way you can see
who put the note in.

515
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:44,083
That I get,
but why am I a woman?

516
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:46,542
Because a man can't enter
the women's section!

517
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,250
You only want to get men's notes?

518
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,333
That's inequality.

519
00:34:06,125 --> 00:34:06,958
There.

520
00:34:07,542 --> 00:34:10,042
Did you see her? Go for it.

521
00:34:10,667 --> 00:34:12,833
You mean the one
with the baskets, right?

522
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:16,792
No! What's wrong with you?

523
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:18,542
I mean the pretty one.

524
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:23,375
Pretty? Did you forget
what we're here for?

525
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:26,292
That old lady needs more help
than the pretty one.

526
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:28,875
What? Look how strong she is!

527
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:32,250
Besides, so what if she's striking,
doesn't she deserve our help?

528
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:34,875
Even the pretty ones
have troubles you know.

529
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:36,792
You can't discriminate like that.

530
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:40,542
I'm going in.

531
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:08,917
Thank you.

532
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:27,875
"Dear God,

533
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:32,125
soon my little Boris
is have a Bar Mitzvah.

534
00:35:32,208 --> 00:35:33,042
Soon?

535
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:37,083
Boris is sensitive and talented boy,

536
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,167
he play the violin very good.

537
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,292
He is genius.

538
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:44,625
Lately children is
beating him up in school

539
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:45,917
and he be sad.

540
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:48,750
I am asks of you

541
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:51,542
that we manage to make him
big Bar Mitzvah celebration

542
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:53,958
so that friends will likes him.

543
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:56,917
I raise him alone, I have no money.

544
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:59,792
Thanks you, Doniasha Baltov."

545
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:01,708
Sad, huh?

546
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:03,708
Fuck this bra!

547
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:05,250
Help me get it off!

548
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:06,458
What's the problem?

549
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:08,875
It's stuck. Why is the clasp in back?

550
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,000
- Give it here, kebab fingers.
- It doesn't make sense.

551
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,333
It's hard.

552
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,333
Relax!

553
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:21,625
Relax! Let me do it.

554
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:30,500
How's it going?

555
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:34,000
Nice day, isn't it?

556
00:36:39,625 --> 00:36:41,417
Why are you in a costume?

557
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:42,500
What do you care?

558
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:43,750
Don't talk back!

559
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,625
What's with the costume?
Are you a prostitute?

560
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:47,958
We've been getting complaints.

561
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:49,583
No, officer, he's not a prostitute.

562
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:50,917
It's his regular outfit.

563
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,042
Yeah, I like dressing like this. So?

564
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:54,667
Yeah, you want to arrest him

565
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,250
because he's a tranny?

566
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:57,542
What?

567
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,708
Yes, I'm a tranny.

568
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:10,000
And this is my boyfriend,
he's in the closet.

569
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:11,542
Shut up! That's disgusting!

570
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:13,125
Stop!

571
00:37:15,125 --> 00:37:17,125
Get the hell outta here
before I take you in.

572
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:33,875
BALTOV

573
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:36,542
Hello.

574
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:40,208
We have to talk.

575
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:47,583
Boris, go play in your room.

576
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:57,333
Are you the repo men?

577
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:59,542
I'm all paid up, I have proof.

578
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,917
No, not at all,
we're here to help.

579
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:07,333
We... organize Bar Mitzvahs

580
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:11,042
and the name of your son, Boris,

581
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:13,208
came up in the raffle.

582
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,542
You won!

583
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:19,833
We'll... organize the event for free.

584
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:23,417
We're only here to... you know...

585
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:26,958
find out how many guests,
what kinds of salad you want...

586
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:30,042
This must be mistake,
I didn't sign up for raffle,

587
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:31,375
we don't have money
for big party.

588
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,250
No, it's free.

589
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:36,375
You were automatically signed up.

590
00:38:36,458 --> 00:38:39,750
City hall holds a raffle
for all the 13 year old residents.

591
00:38:40,667 --> 00:38:43,125
Show her the letter you wrote, Chuma.

592
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:46,708
The letter... you printed...
that they wrote.

593
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:47,875
I printed it out.

594
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:57,542
"Congratulations,

595
00:38:57,917 --> 00:39:02,083
Boris won a free Bar Mitzvah
from the city of Jerusalem."

596
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:09,875
I can't believe it,
I never won a thing.

597
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:31,833
So, you're sneaking around
like a thief?

598
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:34,792
Lizo, how's it going?

599
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:36,750
Is that from Steve?

600
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:39,042
Yes.

601
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:41,542
Come in for coffee.

602
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,000
- Is that fennel?
- You like?

603
00:39:57,917 --> 00:40:00,042
- I don't know.
- Watch it, dude.

604
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:04,500
No, sure, it's delicious. Yum.

605
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:09,708
It's just that,
it has such a dominant flavor,

606
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:11,458
you have to go easy on it.

607
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:14,958
As you please.

608
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:18,583
What?

609
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:28,667
Listen, even if he ever
gets over his stupid issues

610
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,042
and comes to his senses,
I'm not sure Avisar will want to see him.

611
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:35,833
It's hard for him,
you know about his past.

612
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:36,792
Whatever.

613
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,792
One day he'll be here.

614
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:45,000
My grandmother says that emotions
are like udders,

615
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:48,417
the cow provides milk
only when it wants to,

616
00:40:48,917 --> 00:40:49,833
no need to press.

617
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:52,833
That's lovely.

618
00:40:55,042 --> 00:40:57,958
Thank you. From Grandma.

619
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,000
KURCHALOY, CHECHNYA

620
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:09,000
I haven't seen the bastard
in five years.

621
00:41:13,417 --> 00:41:15,708
She says he hasn't been here
in five years.

622
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:16,667
I got it.

623
00:41:22,167 --> 00:41:26,292
The shit asks if he sent something,
maybe money.

624
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,875
Five years I haven't seen

625
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:31,833
a hair from his balls!

626
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:41,750
- Do you believe her?
- She spit, didn't she?

627
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,375
He ripped us off
and bailed to America.

628
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:47,625
I totally get the guy.
Look at this dump.

629
00:41:47,708 --> 00:41:51,417
Is this any place to raise a family?

630
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:55,000
Where's the kindergarten?
Where's the school?

631
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,417
What if you want to make pizza
with the kids after school?

632
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:00,167
Where's the ambulance station?

633
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,292
What if the kid falls
and splits his chin open?

634
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:04,417
The ambulance?
Stop bustin' my chops.

635
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,667
Let's look for the Cyclops.

636
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:09,167
- Fine...
- Don't "fine" me, let's go!

637
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:18,792
- Crispy snacks.
- What's that?

638
00:42:20,292 --> 00:42:22,583
I made us a list to end all lists.

639
00:42:23,542 --> 00:42:25,125
I want to throw that Boris Yeltsin

640
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:27,042
a Bar Mitzvah as if he were my son.

641
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,208
What?

642
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:35,833
Nothing, you hate when I mention it.

643
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,125
Then why do you mention it?

644
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:40,042
Because you have to hear it.

645
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,083
"As if he were my son..."

646
00:42:41,167 --> 00:42:43,167
You have a son that you don't even know!

647
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,583
You starting with me again?

648
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:46,167
Yes. Shame on you.

649
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:49,917
If your late mother knew about this,
she'd die all over again.

650
00:42:50,375 --> 00:42:52,000
- Stop the car.
- No.

651
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,958
- I said, stop the car!
- No.

652
00:42:54,167 --> 00:42:56,250
Stop the car or I'll shove the sandwich

653
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:57,208
up your ass!

654
00:43:12,542 --> 00:43:14,583
The truth hurts, doesn't it?

655
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:16,958
Get the hell outta my face.

656
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:29,875
Okay, get in. I'm sorry.

657
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:42,542
So now you're not talking to me?

658
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:46,458
I'll only talk to you
about professional matters.

659
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:47,875
Okay.

660
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,667
So when you throw a party
for a small Russian family

661
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,583
that I bet doesn't have many guests,

662
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,500
and that Boris plays the violin,
he's European...

663
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:57,458
Of course.

664
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,875
You think I'd let him forget his roots?

665
00:44:23,958 --> 00:44:26,417
What is this?

666
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,667
What can you do? Boris is Israeli.

667
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,958
This is how Israelis celebrate.

668
00:44:31,042 --> 00:44:32,292
He's a genius musician,

669
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:34,375
he mustn't let anyone spoil that.

670
00:44:57,917 --> 00:44:59,333
Mama, did you see the donkey?

671
00:44:59,417 --> 00:45:01,083
I never imagined a Bar Mitzvah like this

672
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:02,167
in my wildest dreams!

673
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,625
Thank you, Mama, I love you.

674
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:06,500
My dear son.

675
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:09,208
Boris, come dance with me.

676
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:26,750
Don't you dance?

677
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:30,125
With you, of course.

678
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:31,833
Yehuda!

679
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,542
Thank you, Steven.

680
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,875
You're our angel.

681
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:06,000
Where's your friend?
I want to thank him too.

682
00:46:06,625 --> 00:46:07,917
No... that's okay,

683
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:12,083
he's very busy. I'll tell him.

684
00:46:12,875 --> 00:46:14,667
I want a take away tray

685
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,167
with everything,

686
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:18,250
three or four of each kind.

687
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:20,542
And if there's Dragee candies,
make sure they're hard

688
00:46:20,667 --> 00:46:23,042
and no sugared peanuts,
Avisar hates when they stick to the teeth.

689
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:24,792
I don't think I can...

690
00:46:29,875 --> 00:46:31,042
Believe in yourself.

691
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:52,958
May I dance with Doniasha?

692
00:46:55,708 --> 00:46:56,542
Go ahead.

693
00:47:04,792 --> 00:47:06,000
Come with me a sec.

694
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:14,458
- Don't think I didn't see.
- What?

695
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,917
We're here to do a good deed

696
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,083
and you're thinking with your dick.

697
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:19,708
Didn't we do a good deed?

698
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:23,583
- What's wrong with you?
- What? I don't get you.

699
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:25,792
- She's not under age.
- She has a kid!

700
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:26,708
So?

701
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:47,333
What's this?

702
00:47:49,042 --> 00:47:51,583
We were at a party at "Star Halls" and...

703
00:47:55,458 --> 00:47:57,500
they serve the best desserts ever.

704
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,708
- So?
- So...

705
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,208
Steve sent these for Avisar.

706
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:04,792
Avisar likes sweets, right?

707
00:48:05,167 --> 00:48:06,417
Come in already.

708
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:35,958
Sweet Boris,

709
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:39,292
he fall asleep with shoes on.

710
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:43,417
Fucking hell...

711
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,292
This is the last of them.

712
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:00,708
I'll be right back.

713
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:12,500
Could you...?

714
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:38,875
Take this before I finish them all.

715
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:42,333
I just love their marzipan.

716
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:44,917
I can always bring more.

717
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:48,292
Why are you doing this?

718
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:52,417
I told you, Steve asked me to.

719
00:49:57,583 --> 00:49:58,542
To your health.

720
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:01,333
Sure.

721
00:50:10,458 --> 00:50:11,708
Here's to you.

722
00:50:13,167 --> 00:50:14,000
Thanks.

723
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,708
Well, I'm off.

724
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,125
You not stay?

725
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:31,125
No. I can't.

726
00:50:32,167 --> 00:50:33,000
Why?

727
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:36,250
I can't be reckless.

728
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:38,792
You know, with Yeltsin here...

729
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:41,667
Boris.

730
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:44,458
You know?

731
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:48,208
Come to the bedroom.

732
00:50:56,792 --> 00:50:57,792
What's wrong?

733
00:50:57,875 --> 00:50:58,708
We shouldn't.

734
00:51:00,208 --> 00:51:01,500
This isn't for real,

735
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:03,958
- it's the alcohol...
- No it's not.

736
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:06,875
I mixed drinks and...

737
00:51:07,458 --> 00:51:08,292
Chuma.

738
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,458
I'll be going now.

739
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,583
Listen, I spoke to Magriso
about Kadaev...

740
00:51:37,667 --> 00:51:38,625
Hold on.

741
00:51:40,083 --> 00:51:42,625
Nineteen thousand. Nice.

742
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:45,250
How did you get him to pay?

743
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:46,958
He didn't want to at first,

744
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:49,750
he said he doesn't have money.
I said, what's this?

745
00:51:49,917 --> 00:51:52,583
He said it's for suppliers,
he owes them,

746
00:51:52,667 --> 00:51:54,500
- he wants to shut the place down.
- And?

747
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:56,542
So I said, 'You don't give, I take."

748
00:51:56,667 --> 00:52:00,417
I opened the cash register,
he went ballistic, I shut him up,

749
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,833
I took the money and came here.

750
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:03,625
- And he won't talk?
- Not anymore.

751
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,167
"Not anymore?"

752
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:08,292
I stabbed him with the ice pick,

753
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:10,417
filled up the bag
and got the hell outta there.

754
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:11,875
Oh yeah?

755
00:52:13,042 --> 00:52:15,208
- So you finished him...
- Yeah.

756
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:28,333
I should shoot you like I shot him.

757
00:52:29,292 --> 00:52:31,667
Where do you get these morons?

758
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:33,583
He killed a man.

759
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,083
He rubs out a source of income

760
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:38,542
and then comes here with the cops
on his tail.

761
00:52:40,917 --> 00:52:42,375
I told you a thousand times,

762
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:44,625
idiots and thieves won't work for me.

763
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:48,458
Okay, scramble him up
and launder the money.

764
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,625
What did Magriso say about Kadaev?

765
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:54,417
If he got a false passport,

766
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,167
someone else must have done it.

767
00:52:58,792 --> 00:53:00,375
Something stinks here.

768
00:53:00,458 --> 00:53:02,708
A man can't just leave without a trace.

769
00:53:03,375 --> 00:53:04,500
Fuck.

770
00:53:04,792 --> 00:53:07,208
Okay, get Steve and Chuma back,

771
00:53:07,292 --> 00:53:08,875
their unpaid leave is over.

772
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:10,583
What's that?

773
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,125
What are you doing?

774
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:48,875
You idiot.

775
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,667
Get up, I'll make coffee.

776
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,417
Get out of here!

777
00:53:55,458 --> 00:53:57,375
Nothing happened last night,
I swear.

778
00:53:57,458 --> 00:53:59,333
You didn't hook up with her?
- No.

779
00:54:01,458 --> 00:54:03,208
Look me in the eye
and say that again.

780
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:07,333
I didn't hook up with her.

781
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,833
And I never will.

782
00:54:11,417 --> 00:54:12,625
I'm just as good a person as you,

783
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,167
it upsets me that you think I'm not.

784
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:19,375
Zadok got back to me.
He took 50/50 off the table.

785
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,625
And the delivery of the trucks is on him.

786
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:24,208
I'll make you some black coffee.

787
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:26,917
You're so annoying.

788
00:54:28,958 --> 00:54:30,833
You're telling me
how good you are

789
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:33,292
and then I gotta hear
about Zadok and the fish kebab?

790
00:54:35,542 --> 00:54:37,042
For fuck's sake...

791
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:39,208
Why are you such a prude?

792
00:54:39,958 --> 00:54:41,250
Someone has to plan for the future.

793
00:54:41,708 --> 00:54:43,750
Why does that make me
a lesser man?

794
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,667
Fine, you're not.

795
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:49,708
Let's go to the Wall
and get another note.

796
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:52,958
Damn it. Well played.

797
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:54,958
My tranny disguise is in the bathroom,

798
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,708
get yourself an outfit together.

799
00:54:58,125 --> 00:54:59,208
It's your turn.

800
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:03,292
Make me a strong coffee.

801
00:55:34,167 --> 00:55:35,042
Your leave is over,

802
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:36,708
Kaslassy wants you guys back.

803
00:55:38,167 --> 00:55:39,708
Where's Steve? He wasn't home.

804
00:55:43,042 --> 00:55:43,917
Can you hear me,

805
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,417
or are you totally deaf?

806
00:55:47,417 --> 00:55:48,250
What?

807
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:49,833
How are you, Zafuf?

808
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:53,167
Damn, I'm talking to myself.

809
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:56,208
The doctor said I need an operation

810
00:55:56,292 --> 00:55:57,667
or I'll lose my hearing for good.

811
00:56:06,042 --> 00:56:07,875
Kaslassy wants you back!

812
00:56:07,958 --> 00:56:09,208
Where's Steve?

813
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,000
Yikes! What's that?

814
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:16,667
Steve...

815
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,875
Kaslassy wants us back.

816
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:23,125
Sure thing.

817
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:25,292
Where do we go?

818
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:27,125
- What "where?"
- Hold on.

819
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:29,875
What's going on with you?

820
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:30,958
With me?

821
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:32,958
What's with the woman's getup?

822
00:56:33,042 --> 00:56:35,208
This is who I am.

823
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:36,833
Are you a tranny?

824
00:56:37,292 --> 00:56:39,250
You say that as if it's a curse.

825
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:40,958
You're not going to collect like that.

826
00:56:41,042 --> 00:56:42,292
Then I'm not collecting.

827
00:56:42,917 --> 00:56:45,167
This is who I am now
and I'm not ashamed of it.

828
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,500
You mean you leave the house like this?

829
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:50,583
When you're close to death,

830
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:54,000
you realize that you were hiding

831
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:54,917
all your life.

832
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:59,708
I'm done being something that I'm not.

833
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,292
Your brain is fried.
Since when is this?

834
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,917
Always.

835
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:06,000
What you see on the outside

836
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:07,750
is not always what happens inside.

837
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:09,833
Whoever loved me

838
00:57:09,917 --> 00:57:10,875
will love me like this.

839
00:57:13,042 --> 00:57:14,000
Like Chuma.

840
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,708
Dude, you've totally lost it.

841
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,500
So what's your name now?

842
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:28,458
Renana.

843
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,542
Dude, you stay here.

844
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,292
Ma'am, you stay here...

845
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,958
Fire and brimstone.

846
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:45,375
Can you go on your own?

847
00:57:47,708 --> 00:57:49,333
Fuck me...

848
00:57:49,542 --> 00:57:50,458
Move!

849
00:58:01,292 --> 00:58:02,750
You think he'll let us off the hook?

850
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:03,750
Hope so.

851
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:06,417
Otherwise we'll have to split to Jersey.

852
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,417
The name Renana suits you...

853
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:23,750
What?

854
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:26,542
You tell me, so you don't say

855
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:28,792
I'm thinking with my dick...

856
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:36,875
That one. She's not your type.

857
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,958
"My name is Bruria, daughter of Leah.

858
00:58:50,042 --> 00:58:52,417
Help me and my husband have a child."

859
00:58:53,958 --> 00:58:55,958
"My name is Bruria, daughter of Leah.

860
00:58:56,458 --> 00:58:58,458
Help me and my husband have a child.

861
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:00,083
I'm 40 years old

862
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:01,500
and I think it may be too late.

863
00:59:02,708 --> 00:59:04,208
We've been trying for a long time,

864
00:59:04,292 --> 00:59:05,708
I'm afraid he'll leave me."

865
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:09,833
I think we're done.

866
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:12,000
What?

867
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:14,083
We can't make her wish come true.

868
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:16,292
Only God can do that.

869
00:59:16,458 --> 00:59:18,083
But we read the note,
we came all the way here...

870
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:19,083
So?

871
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:20,625
It's a medical problem.
How can you help her?

872
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:23,833
You'll knock on the door and say what?

873
00:59:23,917 --> 00:59:25,417
We chose this note.

874
00:59:25,958 --> 00:59:27,583
It's a sign that we can help her.

875
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:31,500
I think it's a different kind of sign.

876
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,417
It's a sign we have to move on.

877
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:42,458
God sees that we're dwelling
on these notes

878
00:59:42,625 --> 00:59:44,833
instead of taking advantage
of our opportunities.

879
00:59:44,917 --> 00:59:47,333
This note is a wakeup call,
we're not God.

880
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:50,500
That doesn't sound right.
It can't end this way.

881
00:59:56,917 --> 00:59:58,750
I'm going to buy us plane tickets.

882
01:00:02,667 --> 01:00:04,167
We deserve a life in America.

883
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:05,833
Don't we?

884
01:00:06,542 --> 01:00:08,458
- You'd leave everything behind?
- Yes.

885
01:00:14,542 --> 01:00:15,375
I don't know.

886
01:00:16,792 --> 01:00:17,750
No pressure.

887
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:22,958
Tomorrow at four
we go to Sharon's travel agency.

888
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:27,458
I'll ask Nissim's sister in law
for seats next to the window, together.

889
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:32,417
We'll fly with Turkish Air,
they serve an awesome Bi-Ajeen.

890
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:34,125
We'll have a good time.

891
01:00:40,667 --> 01:00:42,083
Let's go, Avisar.

892
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:44,458
What did Yigal talk to you about?

893
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:50,083
The game up north.

894
01:00:50,875 --> 01:00:52,000
You didn't tell me about it.

895
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:59,042
Why did you say
your dad would come?

896
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:02,542
Because he will, I believe it
and it will happen.

897
01:01:03,792 --> 01:01:04,667
You're right.

898
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,292
If you believe, it happens.

899
01:01:07,375 --> 01:01:08,250
So you should believe too.

900
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:10,042
I do, Avisar, but...

901
01:01:13,667 --> 01:01:15,083
Don't you want him to come?

902
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:18,875
I do...

903
01:01:26,292 --> 01:01:27,708
I want you to have a dad.

904
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:29,875
You deserve a dad.

905
01:01:29,958 --> 01:01:32,333
- But I have a dad.
- I know, but I want a good man.

906
01:01:32,917 --> 01:01:34,708
Someone we'll both love...

907
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:36,667
Then he won't be my dad.

908
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:38,417
He'll be better than your dad,

909
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,750
because we'll pick him and he'll pick you.

910
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:48,792
Chuma...
What are you doing here?

911
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:52,125
It's Tuesday, soccer practice...

912
01:01:54,667 --> 01:01:55,917
Is everything all right?

913
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:58,042
Yes.

914
01:01:58,542 --> 01:02:00,708
I was at the bakery,

915
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:02,375
I thought you might be hungry.

916
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:06,375
I got you your favorite,
with spinach.

917
01:02:11,917 --> 01:02:13,875
Come, I'll drive you home.
My car's up there.

918
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:37,167
I split it 50/50, after expenses...

919
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,583
You can still change your mind.

920
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:44,458
- When's the flight?
- Thursday.

921
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,625
Good luck, bro.

922
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:50,958
You're making a mistake
by not coming.

923
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:54,750
I can't.

924
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:58,375
I respect that.

925
01:04:07,042 --> 01:04:08,167
Tell me...

926
01:04:09,167 --> 01:04:11,208
let's say you were in my place,

927
01:04:12,292 --> 01:04:13,625
what would you do with...

928
01:04:13,708 --> 01:04:14,833
that Bruria woman?

929
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:17,708
Which Bruria?

930
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:20,458
The woman... from the note...

931
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:22,750
The one who can't get pregnant.

932
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:24,083
You won't let go?

933
01:04:24,167 --> 01:04:26,042
Help me out with this before you go.

934
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:27,167
What would you do?

935
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:28,750
I told you, it's impossible.

936
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:29,833
Don't you get it?

937
01:04:29,958 --> 01:04:31,792
Fine, I got it, I'm not God.

938
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:34,583
I'm just asking you

939
01:04:34,667 --> 01:04:35,875
for your craziest idea.

940
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:41,667
Give me something
from that brain of yours.

941
01:05:10,917 --> 01:05:12,167
Didn't you see me?

942
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,542
I'm sorry, Ma'am, are you all right?

943
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:15,375
What's wrong with you, man?

944
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,042
I didn't see her.

945
01:05:19,208 --> 01:05:20,708
That's how people get killed.

946
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:21,833
Are you all right?

947
01:05:22,417 --> 01:05:24,625
I'm fine. He just dented my car.

948
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:26,500
Take her to the hospital.

949
01:05:26,583 --> 01:05:27,917
What? That's not necessary.

950
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,875
- She's fine.
- Don't you tell me she's fine!

951
01:05:32,083 --> 01:05:33,917
Take her to the hospital
and I'm coming with.

952
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:36,167
"She's fine," he tells me...

953
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:38,208
A hemorrhage can go undetected.

954
01:05:39,542 --> 01:05:42,000
And you can't drive. We'll park your car

955
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:45,083
- and I'll accompany you to the hospital.
- There's no need...

956
01:05:45,167 --> 01:05:48,000
Ma'am, I'm not asking you,

957
01:05:48,417 --> 01:05:50,750
I'm an officer on duty
and I'm instructing you.

958
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:05,083
Don't fall asleep, it's dangerous.

959
01:06:05,542 --> 01:06:06,542
I won't.

960
01:06:08,292 --> 01:06:10,417
Is there anyone who can pick up
the kids from school?

961
01:06:10,667 --> 01:06:12,667
I... don't have kids.

962
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:16,792
Are you single?

963
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,125
Are you coming on to her?

964
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:20,958
Haven't you done enough?

965
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,667
No, I'm married.

966
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:25,750
No kids?

967
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:28,792
That's too bad.

968
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:35,125
People live their lives
chasing after careers,

969
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:39,542
suddenly they're all alone at 50.

970
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:45,417
A person could die in his home,
his head in his vomit,

971
01:06:45,792 --> 01:06:49,583
and there's no kid
to pick his chin up off the table.

972
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:02,208
Are you in pain?

973
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:04,750
From the collision?

974
01:07:07,458 --> 01:07:09,875
Excuse me, officer,

975
01:07:10,667 --> 01:07:12,125
but you have no tact.

976
01:07:13,708 --> 01:07:16,750
Ma'am, forgive me
if I'm invading your private space,

977
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:19,208
but haven't you seen a specialist?

978
01:07:19,292 --> 01:07:20,542
There's no stopping you.

979
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:21,667
Watch your mouth.

980
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:23,375
I can still arrest you for hit and run.

981
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:25,000
But I didn't run, I'm right here!

982
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,000
- Shut up! Don't shout at me!
- No...

983
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:29,667
We haven't.

984
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,333
My husband doesn't believe in...

985
01:07:32,417 --> 01:07:33,500
Doesn't believe?

986
01:07:34,292 --> 01:07:37,375
You don't have that privilege,
you have to see a doctor.

987
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,208
There happens to be a doctor
in this hospital who helped my sister.

988
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:41,833
He's very famous.

989
01:07:41,917 --> 01:07:43,583
Prof. Luria something.

990
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:45,833
Prof. Luria David?

991
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:50,500
Yes. How do you know?

992
01:07:50,583 --> 01:07:51,792
So you did look into doctors.

993
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:55,333
No. This is his office.

994
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:57,417
What a small world.

995
01:07:58,417 --> 01:08:00,875
- Go in.
- "Go in?"

996
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:03,167
He's not a shoemaker, look at this line.

997
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:04,500
So? This is an emergency.

998
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:05,750
And you're with a police officer.

999
01:08:11,458 --> 01:08:12,917
Where's the emergency?

1000
01:08:14,125 --> 01:08:15,167
She isn't bleeding,

1001
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:16,875
it's not a matter of life and death.

1002
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,625
It's a matter of life and life.

1003
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:23,458
You don't get to decide
what's important and what's not.

1004
01:08:23,583 --> 01:08:24,917
First you'll examine her

1005
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,792
and then I'll decide if I should

1006
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:28,792
check up on your shady business here...

1007
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:31,792
Maybe you don't want that.

1008
01:08:41,208 --> 01:08:42,167
Shall we begin?

1009
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:49,833
You see? When you want to...

1010
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,417
What a plan.

1011
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,042
I would have never come up with that.

1012
01:08:58,083 --> 01:08:59,125
Please...

1013
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:00,542
I give credit where credit is due.

1014
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:03,083
I appreciate that.

1015
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:06,417
Listen, Chuma...

1016
01:09:08,542 --> 01:09:12,917
now that we've solved
this thing with the note,

1017
01:09:13,667 --> 01:09:14,625
why not come with me?

1018
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:17,875
Her wish wasn't to see Dr. Luria.

1019
01:09:18,542 --> 01:09:19,875
She wants to get pregnant.

1020
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:21,417
It's not over.

1021
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,750
We have to make the wishes
come true as written.

1022
01:09:27,875 --> 01:09:30,000
But at least now we'll know
what's wrong with her.

1023
01:09:32,958 --> 01:09:33,792
You're a genius!

1024
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:37,208
You're gonna ace it in America.

1025
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:40,458
- You think so?
- Sure.

1026
01:09:51,125 --> 01:09:51,958
Tell me,

1027
01:09:54,417 --> 01:09:56,250
just so I know how you operate,

1028
01:09:57,875 --> 01:10:00,417
if you're in the process
of making a wish come true,

1029
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,667
can you read another note
at the same time?

1030
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:06,167
Why?

1031
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,292
I have a few days before I leave.

1032
01:10:19,792 --> 01:10:22,500
- It's packed today.
- Yes.

1033
01:10:22,958 --> 01:10:25,208
There, those two.

1034
01:10:25,292 --> 01:10:28,000
No, today we go to the men's section.

1035
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:30,083
So, why did I get dressed like this?

1036
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:31,667
I didn't ask you to.

1037
01:10:34,458 --> 01:10:35,500
Isn't that?

1038
01:10:36,875 --> 01:10:38,083
Yes. Avisar.

1039
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:44,542
Zachi, put a note in the Wall
and we're outta here.

1040
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:46,833
Avisar, you know what to do.

1041
01:10:47,833 --> 01:10:49,292
Good, off you go.

1042
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:55,792
Hey, you're not taking his note.

1043
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:58,792
Why, you scared? It's about time.

1044
01:10:59,958 --> 01:11:02,667
I said, not his note. Stop butting in.

1045
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:04,125
Who's asking you?

1046
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:05,042
Chuma!

1047
01:11:06,292 --> 01:11:07,125
Chuma!

1048
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:12,917
Ma'am, you can't come in here.

1049
01:12:05,458 --> 01:12:07,500
You keep bustin' my hump
about that kid,

1050
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:09,708
now you're not telling me
what he wrote?

1051
01:12:12,208 --> 01:12:14,375
You know, what can a kid ask for?

1052
01:12:15,792 --> 01:12:17,250
A bike, chocolate...

1053
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:39,542
Keep your hands to yourself!

1054
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:44,458
I WISH NETANEL WAS MY FATHER.

1055
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:50,833
Netanel?

1056
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:54,708
How does he know your name?

1057
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,583
I look after him.

1058
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:01,542
What?

1059
01:13:03,083 --> 01:13:04,375
For you.

1060
01:13:05,208 --> 01:13:06,375
Who asked you to?

1061
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,958
I thought one day
you'd come to your senses...

1062
01:13:10,083 --> 01:13:11,333
It will never happen!

1063
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:14,000
I'm telling you for the thousandth time,
he's not my kid.

1064
01:13:14,083 --> 01:13:15,042
I don't believe that.

1065
01:13:15,125 --> 01:13:18,083
Up yours!
I can't have kids, don't you get it?

1066
01:13:23,542 --> 01:13:24,750
What?

1067
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:25,833
You heard me.

1068
01:13:32,292 --> 01:13:33,542
Remember once you suggested

1069
01:13:33,625 --> 01:13:35,500
we go to the sperm bank

1070
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:36,833
and make some extra cash

1071
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:37,958
and I said it's a bad idea?

1072
01:13:38,833 --> 01:13:39,750
Yeah.

1073
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,292
You know why I said that?

1074
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:46,792
Because I thought about it before you.

1075
01:13:48,042 --> 01:13:51,792
I was told I can't be a donor,

1076
01:13:52,333 --> 01:13:54,708
my sperm's no good.

1077
01:13:56,042 --> 01:13:57,833
Do you get what I'm saying, Chuma?

1078
01:13:58,792 --> 01:13:59,625
I'm infertile.

1079
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:03,083
Like Sarah our foremother.

1080
01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:06,792
So what are you saying?

1081
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:08,375
That Lizo cheated on you?

1082
01:14:09,667 --> 01:14:10,500
Yes.

1083
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,333
Hello?

1084
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:21,292
Hello, Officer Asaf Hefetz?

1085
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:25,625
Oh... Yes, this is he.

1086
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:28,375
As you requested,

1087
01:14:28,458 --> 01:14:30,542
<i>though I'm bound by confidentiality,</i>

1088
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:31,958
<i>I'm letting you know</i>

1089
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:34,750
that the lady you brought in is fertile,

1090
01:14:35,417 --> 01:14:37,375
it's her husband
who has the problem.

1091
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:41,958
Officer, we're good, right?

1092
01:14:42,917 --> 01:14:45,250
- Yes.
- Am I off the hook?

1093
01:14:45,333 --> 01:14:46,667
Doctor, can I ask you a question?

1094
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,250
<i>- Who is this?</i>
- The other guy, the driver.

1095
01:14:50,458 --> 01:14:51,667
Are you still together?

1096
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:54,917
Her husband, he's infertile, right?

1097
01:14:55,292 --> 01:14:57,375
Is there any chance of a miracle?

1098
01:14:58,125 --> 01:15:00,583
There have been cases where...

1099
01:15:01,167 --> 01:15:02,250
What are you doing?

1100
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:04,375
Why are you butting in?

1101
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,917
You heard what he said,
it's happened before.

1102
01:15:07,292 --> 01:15:10,708
Go to hell.
Stay away from me.

1103
01:15:11,958 --> 01:15:13,333
Thank God I'm leaving.

1104
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:48,375
- Lizo, can I ask you a question?
- Go ahead.

1105
01:15:52,667 --> 01:15:53,708
Who is Avisar's father?

1106
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:57,292
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

1107
01:15:59,250 --> 01:16:02,458
What's wrong with you?
Don't you know who he is?

1108
01:16:02,542 --> 01:16:04,000
He sends you over with the envelopes,
doesn't he?

1109
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:07,458
Could you have been
with another man at the time?

1110
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:13,625
Get the hell out.

1111
01:16:38,792 --> 01:16:39,625
What...

1112
01:16:42,125 --> 01:16:43,333
What are you doing here?

1113
01:16:44,542 --> 01:16:45,583
Should I go?

1114
01:16:46,667 --> 01:16:47,917
No, of course not.

1115
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:49,958
Come inside.

1116
01:16:56,417 --> 01:16:57,417
Is this yours?

1117
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:00,208
No, I'm... house-sitting for some woman.

1118
01:17:01,667 --> 01:17:03,125
I didn't know you have woman.

1119
01:17:04,083 --> 01:17:05,000
My grandmother.

1120
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:10,000
Can I get you something to drink?

1121
01:17:11,417 --> 01:17:12,417
Something light.

1122
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:19,417
There's only Stoli.

1123
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:29,833
Why did you leave?

1124
01:17:35,458 --> 01:17:36,500
Do you want me?

1125
01:17:39,125 --> 01:17:39,958
Of course.

1126
01:17:44,458 --> 01:17:45,333
But we can't.

1127
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:53,208
There's a kid involved.

1128
01:17:55,542 --> 01:17:57,750
Responsibilities.

1129
01:17:58,833 --> 01:17:59,875
We have to think ahead.

1130
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:03,083
That's why I'm not afraid.
You're a good father.

1131
01:18:05,458 --> 01:18:06,708
I don't think so.

1132
01:18:08,958 --> 01:18:10,500
I don't know that it means to be a father.

1133
01:18:11,375 --> 01:18:12,542
Where's your father?

1134
01:18:14,625 --> 01:18:15,792
He's dead.

1135
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,708
Doniasha, this is a bad idea.

1136
01:18:42,167 --> 01:18:43,000
All right.

1137
01:18:44,542 --> 01:18:45,708
I'll go.

1138
01:18:54,708 --> 01:18:55,708
Is he really dead?

1139
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:01,917
Your father isn't dead.

1140
01:19:04,042 --> 01:19:05,167
He abandoned you.

1141
01:19:07,667 --> 01:19:09,667
I know the sad eyes of a kid

1142
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:10,917
whose father left him.

1143
01:19:13,542 --> 01:19:15,417
Don't be afraid you'll be like him.

1144
01:19:44,417 --> 01:19:45,875
Sir, can I have the ball?

1145
01:19:46,917 --> 01:19:47,750
Take it.

1146
01:19:52,625 --> 01:19:53,958
Did you feel that too?

1147
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:57,708
I think it's about to rain.

1148
01:19:58,792 --> 01:20:01,125
Or maybe someone's spitting at us
from an airplane.

1149
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:06,917
Tell me, weren't you told
not to talk to strangers?

1150
01:20:07,708 --> 01:20:10,833
You have a king's necklace.
So do I.

1151
01:20:13,792 --> 01:20:14,625
It's nice.

1152
01:20:19,083 --> 01:20:22,333
- Avisar, bring the ball.
- Avisar!

1153
01:20:26,708 --> 01:20:27,625
I kicked it.

1154
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:33,500
Yes!

1155
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:35,417
- Give it to me.
- It's mine.

1156
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:37,083
Let go!

1157
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:40,875
- Hey, stop that.
- Is this your dad, cry baby?

1158
01:20:41,708 --> 01:20:42,583
No, I'm not his dad.

1159
01:20:42,667 --> 01:20:44,667
Then keep out of this, pumpkin head.

1160
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:47,208
Kid, watch your mouth.
Who do you think you are?

1161
01:20:48,375 --> 01:20:49,458
What happened?

1162
01:20:49,667 --> 01:20:51,708
I won his marble and he's cheating.

1163
01:20:51,917 --> 01:20:53,458
- Why are you cheating?
- I didn't lose.

1164
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:54,792
I'll smack you, kid.

1165
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:56,458
Did he lose?

1166
01:20:56,542 --> 01:20:57,583
- Yes.
- Yes.

1167
01:20:57,833 --> 01:20:59,375
Give him the marble.

1168
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:00,667
Be a man, you're older.

1169
01:21:01,208 --> 01:21:02,208
Set an example.

1170
01:21:02,292 --> 01:21:04,167
You'll be respected
because you're a man,

1171
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:06,042
not because people fear you.

1172
01:21:06,125 --> 01:21:07,583
Go on, give it back.

1173
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:11,625
There you go.

1174
01:21:13,417 --> 01:21:14,625
Wait, what is that?
Give it to me.

1175
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:15,625
No.

1176
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:16,833
I said, give it to me!

1177
01:21:17,625 --> 01:21:19,417
Tell her, Kaslassy said

1178
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:22,333
it's the last time
she goes near Biton's daughter,

1179
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,833
or else... Wait!

1180
01:21:25,917 --> 01:21:27,083
I'll talk to you later.

1181
01:21:27,667 --> 01:21:28,500
What?

1182
01:21:29,542 --> 01:21:31,333
- Who's this?
- What?

1183
01:21:31,667 --> 01:21:32,542
Look into the pupil.

1184
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:33,833
Who is this looking at you?

1185
01:21:33,917 --> 01:21:35,208
What the hell do you want?

1186
01:21:35,542 --> 01:21:36,375
Look at it now.

1187
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,208
- Kadaev.
- Yes.

1188
01:21:39,292 --> 01:21:40,500
You found him?

1189
01:21:40,583 --> 01:21:42,542
No. Just his eye.

1190
01:21:43,458 --> 01:21:46,875
I saw some kids playing with it,
they thought it's a marble.

1191
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,458
Maybe it flew out during the explosion.

1192
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:53,583
But it makes no sense.

1193
01:21:54,792 --> 01:21:56,833
Kadaev always stands outside
with the briefcase.

1194
01:21:57,417 --> 01:21:59,667
Couldn't he have gone in
with the briefcase?

1195
01:22:03,458 --> 01:22:05,167
- David.
- Yeah?

1196
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:08,500
Are these cameras always on?

1197
01:22:08,833 --> 01:22:09,708
Yes, why?

1198
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:11,958
Were they on the day of the explosion?

1199
01:22:12,042 --> 01:22:13,958
Of course, the police have the footage.

1200
01:22:20,208 --> 01:22:21,500
Kaslassy?

1201
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:23,125
Who do we have on the force?

1202
01:22:24,292 --> 01:22:26,583
Fitussi?
What's his last name?

1203
01:23:29,042 --> 01:23:30,875
I'll have green onion and parsley.

1204
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,333
Onion.

1205
01:23:34,875 --> 01:23:36,250
And parsley.

1206
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:43,958
I don't have any change.

1207
01:23:46,083 --> 01:23:48,500
Take this. I sell it for 20.

1208
01:23:48,958 --> 01:23:50,958
- Instead of the I owe you.
- What am I gonna do with that?

1209
01:23:51,042 --> 01:23:53,542
- Is it alcohol?
- This is the creme de la creme.

1210
01:23:53,625 --> 01:23:55,458
Drink this, you'll make twins.

1211
01:23:56,375 --> 01:24:00,208
Drink it at night, your sperm
takes off like a Cessna!

1212
01:24:00,750 --> 01:24:01,625
All right.

1213
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:06,792
- Zecharia, how's it going?
- Good.

1214
01:24:07,125 --> 01:24:09,458
I want a nice bouquet
to appease a woman.

1215
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:11,208
I don't sell flowers, friend.

1216
01:24:11,792 --> 01:24:13,292
These are better than flowers.

1217
01:24:13,375 --> 01:24:14,500
She can eat them too.

1218
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:16,542
And the scent...

1219
01:24:18,667 --> 01:24:19,542
Here you go.

1220
01:24:40,167 --> 01:24:41,458
I'm sorry.

1221
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,125
I don't know
what came over me.

1222
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:51,292
It's... none of my business.

1223
01:24:51,375 --> 01:24:52,833
You're right, you're a moron.

1224
01:25:02,375 --> 01:25:03,958
Seriously?
You really are a moron...

1225
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:22,958
This is for you.

1226
01:25:27,083 --> 01:25:28,000
Thank you.

1227
01:25:31,542 --> 01:25:32,625
He never sent you, did he?

1228
01:25:33,667 --> 01:25:34,500
What?

1229
01:25:35,208 --> 01:25:37,167
The envelopes, the presents...

1230
01:25:39,583 --> 01:25:41,167
Of course he did...

1231
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:42,625
Don't lie to me.

1232
01:25:44,167 --> 01:25:45,000
Look at me.

1233
01:25:46,542 --> 01:25:48,667
Look me in the eye
and tell me the truth.

1234
01:25:53,167 --> 01:25:54,917
It was always you, wasn't it?

1235
01:26:34,292 --> 01:26:37,125
- Is this from Zecharia?
- Yes.

1236
01:26:37,708 --> 01:26:39,083
How do you know Zecharia?

1237
01:26:39,167 --> 01:26:40,917
Steve used to buy from him too.

1238
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,125
He used to bring me mint and say,

1239
01:26:43,208 --> 01:26:44,833
"This is better than flowers.

1240
01:26:44,958 --> 01:26:46,792
You can smell it and eat it too."

1241
01:26:47,917 --> 01:26:48,833
I taught him that.

1242
01:26:49,667 --> 01:26:51,292
I melted when he said that.

1243
01:26:57,583 --> 01:26:58,417
I see...

1244
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:04,458
He went to Zecharia,
came back here,

1245
01:27:05,792 --> 01:27:06,875
you had sex...

1246
01:27:07,833 --> 01:27:08,917
"Cessna..."

1247
01:27:09,917 --> 01:27:10,750
What?

1248
01:27:40,792 --> 01:27:42,000
YECHIEL AND BRURIA BENISTI

1249
01:27:44,417 --> 01:27:45,375
How's it going?

1250
01:27:46,750 --> 01:27:48,167
Fine. What...?

1251
01:27:48,542 --> 01:27:50,083
I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

1252
01:27:50,792 --> 01:27:53,167
I am, thanks.
How did you know where I...?

1253
01:27:53,292 --> 01:27:55,875
Your license plate.
The officer told me.

1254
01:27:57,042 --> 01:27:59,417
Look, you went above and beyond,
I'm fine.

1255
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:02,083
I wanted to take this opportunity
to give you something.

1256
01:28:04,333 --> 01:28:05,167
What's that?

1257
01:28:07,167 --> 01:28:08,250
It's for your husband.

1258
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:09,958
Excuse me?

1259
01:28:11,292 --> 01:28:14,750
A friend recommended it to me
and I thought of you.

1260
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:16,958
What does it do?

1261
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:20,667
It's... a miracle cure.

1262
01:28:21,083 --> 01:28:22,708
It helped a good friend of mine.

1263
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:26,625
All he needs is a quick drink
before bedtime...

1264
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,458
It'll put him to sleep?

1265
01:28:30,292 --> 01:28:31,875
No. I mean, before...

1266
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:34,167
before...

1267
01:28:37,625 --> 01:28:38,625
you know...

1268
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:41,500
before... you get busy.

1269
01:28:48,208 --> 01:28:49,625
Before the consummation?

1270
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:52,333
Yes! Before the consummation.

1271
01:28:54,375 --> 01:28:57,375
And things will take off...
like a Cessna!

1272
01:29:04,167 --> 01:29:05,000
Talk to me.

1273
01:29:08,083 --> 01:29:09,708
I had to call in a favor.

1274
01:29:09,792 --> 01:29:11,792
You better not tell anyone!

1275
01:29:11,917 --> 01:29:13,042
Do you have the result?

1276
01:29:16,208 --> 01:29:17,292
That's right.

1277
01:29:17,417 --> 01:29:19,167
What's wrong with you?

1278
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:20,333
What's wrong with me?

1279
01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:22,083
He's your kid!

1280
01:29:27,458 --> 01:29:29,208
If Mom were alive, she'd die.

1281
01:29:31,708 --> 01:29:33,625
Yona, are you sure?

1282
01:29:33,708 --> 01:29:35,333
One hundred percent.

1283
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:39,667
Where is he?
I want to meet him.

1284
01:29:40,417 --> 01:29:42,375
You have a son
and you didn't tell me.

1285
01:29:42,833 --> 01:29:45,583
How old is he?
Who's his mother?

1286
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:47,917
What did you do?

1287
01:29:49,042 --> 01:29:51,708
Didn't you learn your lesson
after what Dad did to us?

1288
01:29:52,167 --> 01:29:53,583
What's wrong with you?

1289
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:15,667
Look closely.

1290
01:32:17,208 --> 01:32:19,708
There. You see?

1291
01:32:22,458 --> 01:32:24,333
They went out the back door,

1292
01:32:24,417 --> 01:32:25,375
that's why no one saw them.

1293
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:27,625
They stole my $400,000.

1294
01:32:28,333 --> 01:32:29,583
And now they're wearing dresses.

1295
01:32:30,292 --> 01:32:31,792
Motherfuckers.

1296
01:32:37,208 --> 01:32:40,667
BRURIA LIZO STEVE

1297
01:32:56,208 --> 01:32:59,333
CHUMA CALLING

1298
01:33:15,833 --> 01:33:16,667
PASSPORT

1299
01:33:30,958 --> 01:33:33,500
I WISH NETANEL WAS MY FATHER

1300
01:34:29,417 --> 01:34:30,750
Did you find out about Lizo?

1301
01:34:52,625 --> 01:34:55,167
Zafuf, your wife is here.

1302
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:57,583
My wife? What is she doing here?

1303
01:34:57,667 --> 01:34:58,667
Stay outside.

1304
01:35:03,542 --> 01:35:06,958
What can I do? My phone was on silent.
Maybe it's urgent.

1305
01:35:07,292 --> 01:35:08,375
Urgent?

1306
01:35:08,542 --> 01:35:11,917
I told you a thousand times,
get rid of that hag.

1307
01:35:12,083 --> 01:35:16,125
She's nothing but bad luck.
You've gotten to be such a sourpuss.

1308
01:35:16,583 --> 01:35:20,708
Go, get her out of here
so she doesn't see or hear anything.

1309
01:35:22,333 --> 01:35:23,542
Go!

1310
01:35:32,375 --> 01:35:34,208
Where's the money?

1311
01:35:36,417 --> 01:35:38,083
I'll tell you if you let Steve go.

1312
01:35:39,583 --> 01:35:40,625
What are you doing?

1313
01:35:43,708 --> 01:35:47,125
You have to stay.
You have to raise your kid.

1314
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:49,542
He doesn't even know me.

1315
01:35:52,792 --> 01:35:56,875
Chuma, you're the one who said
the wishes need to come true as written.

1316
01:36:01,458 --> 01:36:04,125
There's no better person than you
to raise Avisar.

1317
01:36:08,708 --> 01:36:10,708
I'm deeply moved.

1318
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:16,542
Let Chuma go,
I'll tell you where the money is.

1319
01:36:19,208 --> 01:36:21,208
You know what? I'll decide.

1320
01:37:55,625 --> 01:37:57,500
Avisar, sweetie, we gotta go.

1321
01:37:58,042 --> 01:38:00,042
If we're late,
we'll be disqualified.

1322
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:01,917
Wait.

1323
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,667
No, we can't.

1324
01:38:05,125 --> 01:38:07,917
It's a two and a half hour drive.
Let's go.

1325
01:38:09,125 --> 01:38:10,667
Two more minutes.

1326
01:38:16,917 --> 01:38:18,417
Avisar, he's not coming.

1327
01:38:19,917 --> 01:38:20,958
He'll be here.

1328
01:38:32,583 --> 01:38:34,792
- Is that the bus to the game?
- Yes.

1329
01:38:36,458 --> 01:38:37,458
And you are...?

1330
01:38:39,625 --> 01:38:40,625
I'm Avisar's dad.

1331
01:38:52,292 --> 01:38:53,167
You?

1332
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:03,625
I knew it's you!

1333
01:39:12,625 --> 01:39:13,875
So, can we get a move on?

1334
01:39:25,833 --> 01:39:27,000
Let's go, dude.

1335
01:39:35,333 --> 01:39:38,167
I made you a tuna sandwich, you like?

1336
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:40,375
I can't eat before a game.

1337
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:41,917
I knew that.

1338
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:44,583
Avisar, Is that your dad?

1339
01:39:46,250 --> 01:39:47,625
Sit, sit. sit.

1340
01:39:54,708 --> 01:39:55,750
Chuma!

1341
01:39:56,917 --> 01:39:57,917
Get on!

1342
01:40:00,542 --> 01:40:01,542
We'll make room!
