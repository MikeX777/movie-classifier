1
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,880
My Daddy always says,

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,880
when you feel really weak,

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,880
icebergs break off
the North Pole somewhere,

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,280
to show you
how strong you really are.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,200
And when you're small,
that just means

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,880
you have a lot of outgrowing
yourself left to do.

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,560
And I'm good at that,
he always says.

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,240
He told me

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,480
if a moment comes where
you're really sad,

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,560
you can wish yourself
wherever you want to go.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,760
You just have to wish really hard.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,440
I think this is a moment like that.

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,400
But the place I wish to go

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,040
is different from all other
places that exist.

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,240
There's no wind there,

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,040
because there's no air at all there.

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,680
Not even the teeniest tiniest
breath of air.

18
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,000
And it's icy cold,

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,040
"freezier" than in the fridge.

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,680
It's a strange place.

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,320
There are no sounds at all there.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,360
It's "mouse-whispery" quiet

23
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,840
and also a little bit spooky.

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,680
And one side is "dungeon-dark".

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,240
I mean, really, "pitch-dark".

26
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,480
If you look closely at him,

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,640
you'll see he has dark
and light patches.

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,280
Did you know
that the dark ones are actually

29
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,120
craters deep as canyons?

30
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,840
And the light ones
are mountains like skyscrapers?

31
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,960
Or that he changes his shape?

32
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,880
There's just one thing,

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,080
one snag.

34
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,360
Although he's our neighbour,

35
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,520
it takes
a very long time to reach him.

36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,400
Because there's no road.

37
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,920
You have to cross the blackness
above the clouds.

38
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,920
For three days,

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,160
shut into a little capsule.

40
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,320
That's the only thing
that makes me a little bit afraid.

41
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,000
But it's not a bad thing
to be afraid of something.

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,040
It even happens to adults.

43
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,840
My Daddy was away from home
for a long time.

44
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,320
Mummy always says

45
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,480
it's a miracle
he came back to us.

46
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,560
Since then, he's often told me
bedtime stories.

47
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,760
One is about his fear.

48
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,840
It starts like this:

49
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,640
UNTIL THE EDGE OF THE WORLD

50
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,760
It happens with
incredible force.

51
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,560
Can you hear me?

52
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,200
Can you hear me?

53
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,680
Patient 3 has finished
the course of antibiotics.

54
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,000
Number 4,

55
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,560
we need a new approach.

56
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,240
OK, fine.

57
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,000
Did the medication help?

58
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,320
Yes.

59
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,400
A few hours' sleep.

60
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,680
I couldn't hold her back.
She wanted to be with him at once.

61
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,360
We agreed that you and your daughter
would come to me first.

62
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,960
Before a child of her age
sees a relative,

63
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,760
a preparatory talk is important.

64
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,600
And what would you have said?

65
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,160
I'm not on duty
the next two days.

66
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Dr. Wegener will be there for you.

67
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,240
But you can reach me
at any time.

68
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,520
Okay.

69
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,320
-It's the first thing I feel.
-Flo.

70
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,400
A dull blow under my chest,

71
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,760
pressing through my body
again and again.

72
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,280
I know it's happening inside me,

73
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,320
but it feels
like it's happening miles away.

74
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,800
Hot air is forcing itself
into my lungs,

75
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,240
a shrill whistle pierces my head.

76
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,640
I want to open my eyes,

77
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,520
or maybe they're long since open.

78
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,040
And everywhere these voices

79
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,360
and knowing who they are.

80
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,960
Try to get up,

81
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,040
but not a muscle moves.

82
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,320
In front of me

83
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,920
nothing but grey clouds.

84
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,960
Come here.

85
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,480
Come here to me.

86
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,560
We'll make it nice here.

87
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,520
We'll push the beds together
and get some of your toys.

88
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,160
Then it won't be so empty
and unfriendly here, OK?

89
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,920
Why are we here?

90
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,160
So we can be nice and close
to Daddy.

91
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,520
Not have to travel all the time.
It's better.

92
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,520
Where is he?

93
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,720
Here in the hospital.
You know that.

94
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,000
We were just there.

95
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,800
Is he dead?

96
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,000
Flo...

97
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,440
Flo, no, listen to me.

98
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,400
Listen to me, OK?

99
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,720
Just because Daddy isn't moving
doesn't mean that he's dead. OK?

100
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,520
He's very close to us.

101
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,280
No.

102
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,200
Why not, Flo?

103
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,160
He isn't.

104
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,440
-Flo, listen to me!
-He is not.

105
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,560
Flo.

106
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,080
Flo, look.

107
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,800
Look, we don't know much about
Daddy's condition at the moment.

108
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,200
He might be ...

109
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,040
He's...

110
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,680
He might be

111
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,560
somewhere else,
he might be just far away.

112
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,000
What do you mean, far away?

113
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,080
Far, far...

114
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
What do you mean, far away?

115
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,480
Come on, let's go home.

116
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,880
What do you mean, far away?

117
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,360
Can I give you this?
We've changed our minds.

118
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,360
We'd rather go home.

119
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,760
Flo, are you coming?

120
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Flo?

121
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,120
Flo?

122
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,920
Flo, are you coming?

123
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,520
What do you mean, far away?

124
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,800
Come on, let's go home.

125
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,280
What do you mean, far away?

126
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,280
Why are we here?

127
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,880
So we can be nice and close
to Daddy.

128
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,720
Not have to travel that all the time.
It's better.

129
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,360
Where is he?

130
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,960
Here in the hospital.
You know that.

131
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,800
We were just there.

132
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,160
-Is he dead?
-No.

133
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,320
You're lying the other way round.

134
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,440
Sleep tight.

135
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,680
See you in the morning.

136
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,960
Leave them open!

137
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,520
Can he see us?

138
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,600
You know, it's completely different.

139
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,080
Different how?

140
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,480
It's cold and dark.

141
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,920
Just different.

142
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,360
But up there, you're very light

143
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,120
almost as if
you don't have weight any more.

144
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,240
Yes.

145
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,000
But it's just a visit.

146
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,800
Sleep well.

147
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,320
However far away I am
from everything,

148
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,920
it happens more and more often
and for a moment,

149
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,200
everything is suddenly
so real again.

150
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,720
As if it's happening
right here again,

151
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,280
before my eyes.

152
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,640
How I'd love to allow it, Julie.

153
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,080
Your gazes.

154
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,880
But the longer you look at me,

155
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,560
the less I recognise myself
in your gaze.

156
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,760
And I don't know if it's really me.

157
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,040
It really feels

158
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,640
like my own thoughts
are strangers to me.

159
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,480
And I know,

160
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,240
I know that you feel it ...

161
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,800
and how hard it is for you
to see me like this.

162
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,960
Unable to do anything.

163
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,040
And ...

164
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,360
I do notice Flo
also slowly starting to understand.

165
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,440
As if part of me is not here.

166
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,640
With her.

167
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,240
He isn't there any more.

168
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,680
Flo, invisible to the naked eye.

169
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,120
At night,
the sun lights up the moon.

170
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,160
Making him easily visible to the human
eye against the inkblank sky.

171
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,720
In bright daylight, it's difficult
for us to see him in the sky.

172
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,680
But in fact he never leaves our side,
even during the day.

173
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,280
He is our faithful companion,

174
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,720
and in the evening, when it's dark,
we'll be able to gaze on him again.

175
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,560
INVISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE

176
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,480
What does it say there?

177
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,040
GOING TO THE MOON

178
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,240
Now take your rucksack off.

179
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,520
Do I get a kiss?

180
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,560
Are you coming back later?

181
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,920
Of course I'm coming back.

182
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,360
Can I talk to you for a moment?

183
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,200
Go on, go and play.

184
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Run.

185
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,000
I can imagine how hard it is for you
at the moment,

186
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,240
but don't you think it's also
a bit too soon for Flo?

187
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,280
What do you mean, far away?

188
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,520
Come on, let's go home.

189
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,640
What do you mean, far away?

190
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,480
You see,

191
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,440
there's a place there,
where you can rest,

192
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,280
if you're as exhausted
as Daddy is right now.

193
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,280
What place do you mean?

194
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,880
Hasn't it occurred to you

195
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,720
that there's something up there,
always up there, wherever we are?

196
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,840
Wherever we are?

197
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,880
Yes,

198
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,160
wherever.

199
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,520
Can he see us?

200
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,800
In the past people used to fear

201
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,720
that if they went too far
out to sea,

202
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,040
they'd fall off
the edge of the world.

203
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,080
Like off a plate.

204
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,880
But people in those days
just didn't know

205
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,880
that the Earth is round like a ball,

206
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,440
and you can't fall off it at all.

207
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,320
People in those days
knew very little about the Earth

208
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,600
just like we today know
very little about the universe.

209
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,520
We don't even know
if it has a beginning or an end.

210
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,920
In the vastness of space
the Moon is our neighbour.

211
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,720
But even he
is a long journey away.

212
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,120
You have to fly for three days
in a big rocket

213
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,240
through the darkness of space.

214
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,400
Even for the
cleverest scientists

215
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,560
the universe is a big puzzle.

216
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,320
Imagine a long corridor,
with other corridors going off it

217
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,080
and others going off
from those corridors too.

218
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,120
You can't find your way
there at all.

219
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,440
Some scientists

220
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,480
look up into the sky through
lenses as big as elephants

221
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,360
and they're always discovering
new and unknown things.

222
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,480
Like going through a new door

223
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,800
into another corridor.

224
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,680
And from there through more doors
into new corridors,

225
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,760
with doors into more,
longer corridors.

226
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,120
And so on, farther and farther,
again and again,

227
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,720
deeper and deeper.

228
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,640
And we can't even dare to dream

229
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,960
what's hidden behind
some of these doors.

230
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,520
Oh shit.

231
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,040
Can he see us?

232
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,240
You know, it's completely different.

233
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,000
Different how?

234
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,080
It's cold, and, and dark.

235
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,560
Just different.

236
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,840
Almost as if
you don't have weight any more.

237
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,440
But it's just a visit.

238
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,560
I'd be happy to take Flo home
with us tomorrow after kindergarten.

239
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,400
Mila was asking about it.

240
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,600
She asked me if it's true.

241
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,880
-Why? What, what do you mean?
-Julia,

242
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,920
the whole kindergarten group
knows the story.

243
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,880
Flo talks about nothing else.

244
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,640
If I can help you in any way...

245
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,640
I know how difficult
this all is for you.

246
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,920
-But I don't know if it's right to...
-You know nothing.

247
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,520
You know nothing at all.

248
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,160
Her father is attached to 5 million
tubes in hospital, in his bed.

249
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,680
She tries to lift his fingers,
whispers to him...

250
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,640
She doesn't understand
what's going on.

251
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,200
I have the feeling
that Flo is losing herself in it all.

252
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,720
You're making out that she's sick.

253
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,080
She believes in a story that seems
to make it easier for her, that's it.

254
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,200
Mrs Haferkamp gave these to me.

255
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,320
Flo is refusing to do anything else.

256
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,480
What does it say there?

257
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,120
He isn't there any more.

258
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
One new message.

259
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,960
Today, 20:11.

260
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,880
Hey Julie, I'm sorry.

261
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,160
Call me back, OK?
I'm here for you all...

262
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,800
Play back old messages.

263
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,800
Message 1

264
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,200
12.04., 22:03...

265
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,440
Hi honey, just wanted to say,
I'll be home a bit late.

266
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,320
Long, long ago,

267
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,160
the Moon was part of the Earth.

268
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,440
Until a huge impact
knocked him out.

269
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,520
Ever since, he's been above us,

270
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,880
and wherever you are,

271
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,320
he never disappears from our side.

272
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,440
Look carefully at him.

273
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,840
Did you know that he changes
his shape a little bit every day?

274
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,880
From a crescent,
to the circular full moon.

275
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,040
Tell me,

276
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,040
what does he look like now,
above you?

277
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,200
It had been raining that day.

278
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,200
The road was wet.

279
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,520
Maybe you were lost in thoughts.

280
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,320
Tired, I don't know.

281
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,920
They resuscitated you
at the accident site.

282
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,240
The emergency doctor says

283
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,680
you were probably already
brain-dead then.

284
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,800
I don't know why I insisted

285
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,160
on staying
by the machines for three weeks.

286
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
I thought,

287
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,480
I thought,

288
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,720
maybe you'd change your mind again.

289
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,200
Or someone would.

290
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,440
Why do you always sleep here?

291
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,760
Flo, please go back to bed.

292
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,640
Please.

293
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,120
Flo...

294
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,680
Because I can see him
better from here.

295
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,200
That's why.

296
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,720
Better than from here?

297
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,280
As if everything
was merged into oneself:

298
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,760
thoughts, memories.

299
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,440
And I'd so love to just
scream it all out,

300
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,440
for you to understand
what's happening inside me.

301
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,120
But nothing happens!

302
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,560
Instead, this constant fear
of getting swallowed up again

303
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,000
and the thought:
what if it stays like this

304
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,440
and I ...

305
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,080
I never quite find my way back.

306
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,640
Can you hear me?

307
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:02,040
And I know that no one
can see how it looks from here.

308
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,040
It's as if,

309
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,160
as if I'm looking
at a familiar world,

310
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,880
but no longer from inside.

311
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,320
Where is he? Why are we here?

312
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,960
-Can he see us?
-Flo?

313
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,000
What do you mean, far away?

314
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,400
Wherever we are?
He isn't there any more.

315
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,760
Are you coming back later?
Is he dead? -Flo.

316
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,240
Do you know what I dreamt?

317
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,960
I was a long way away.

318
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:56,080
So far away that everything
around me was black.

319
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,040
And the Earth was blue
like a water droplet.

320
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,560
But it wasn't a nightmare.

321
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,960
I was quite close to him up there,

322
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,040
behind a thick pane of glass.

323
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,000
And can you guess
what it was that woke me?

324
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,640
It was when I got tired in the dream
and fell asleep.

325
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,920
I hope I dream
that dream again tonight.

326
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,000
And if I do,
I won't get tired in it,

327
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,240
I'll stay awake.

328
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,680
For three dream days,

329
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,000
until I reach him.

330
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,200
I already know where I'd land.

331
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,800
What about you, Mummy?
What did you dream?

332
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,880
Go on, tell me!
What did you dream?

333
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,920
You won't believe me,

334
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,920
but my dream was very like yours.

335
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,080
How?

336
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,320
It was like a window,

337
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,240
on the world.

338
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,640
Yes, mine too.

339
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,920
Here you are.

340
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,920
Maybe Daddy
is sending us these pictures,

341
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,800
so he doesn't have to travel alone.

342
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,880
Flo ...

343
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,400
No one can send dreams.

344
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,480
Or thoughts.

345
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,000
-They belong only to you.
-No.

346
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,920
They belong to all of us.

347
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,480
Mrs Weidkamp?

348
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,560
Flo?

349
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,560
Mrs Weidkamp?

350
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,960
Dr. Wegener.
I'm standing in for Dr. Renzig.

351
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,680
-If I can do anything for you.
-Yes, I'll let you know.

352
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:01,480
I know you're all
waiting for me.

353
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,840
I know that.

354
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,920
Good.

355
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,200
Flo?

356
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,560
There are small,

357
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,280
strange things.

358
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,840
The feeling

359
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,040
something's not right.

360
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,080
Unease coming closer and closer.

361
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,040
And from one second to the next,

362
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,040
everything goes dark.

363
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,840
Flo?

364
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,600
I want to open my eyes

365
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:52,520
or maybe they've been open
a long time already.

366
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:55,720
And it takes a while

367
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,280
until all the smoke and dust

368
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,000
resolves into
the first shapes again.

369
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,960
Right in front of me.

370
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,280
And I know

371
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,760
that my body is here,

372
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,760
but my head

373
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,840
just won't come back.

374
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,480
The soles of my feet tickle.

375
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,360
Have to be careful

376
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,920
and forget your weight.

377
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,400
Quietly get up.

378
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,760
Not how I imagined it.

379
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,760
I didn't know

380
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,400
that a place could be so lonely,

381
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,040
so desolate.

382
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,240
And whichever way you look

383
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,200
there are grey hills and mountains.

384
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,680
It's a powerful place.

385
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,840
Because the sky there isn't blue,
like ours.

386
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,480
It's inky black.

387
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,680
There's just one eerie thing.

388
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,280
Every step there is not as light
as a feather.

389
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,920
And there's no one to talk to there.

390
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,160
No one to listen.

391
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,440
You're alone with your thoughts.

392
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,680
Flo?

393
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,640
You're never allowed to frighten me
like that again, understand?

394
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,560
You know all the things
that can happen in the street.

395
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,600
Are you going to tell me
what you wanted out there?

396
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,640
Mila.

397
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,160
What do mean, Mila?

398
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,640
Mila helped me.

399
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,920
That's not what I asked.

400
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,560
Although he's gigantic,

401
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,880
the Moon to us
in the end is only as big as a pea.

402
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,160
Small as a pea.

403
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,040
That's because
of the huge distance him and us.

404
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,960
-What do you think?
-What do you think?

405
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,040
If you looked at the Earth
from the Moon,

406
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,640
how big would she look?

407
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,840
You're too far away.

408
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,440
But I'm always here.

409
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,920
Flo?

410
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,040
I don't know
which is moving away faster.

411
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,120
Flo?

412
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,360
Me from everything

413
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,320
or everything from me.

414
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,280
As if I'm forgetting

415
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,960
how my life feels from nearby.

416
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,000
I just want to feel

417
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,920
that I'm still part of this world.

418
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,720
I know

419
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:55,160
this is all happening inside me.

420
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,320
And not around me.

421
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,760
And I can't do anything about it,

422
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,000
except wait.

423
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,480
For it to pass.

424
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,760
So I open my eyes

425
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,720
and I'm back here.

426
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,280
With you.

427
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,440
Flo?

428
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,080
The Moon so close.

429
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:35,360
As he dances around the Earth,
he always turns the same face to us.

430
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,640
If you look closely,

431
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,400
you can see his dark light patches.

432
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:44,760
But though he appears to us
so powerfully,

433
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,440
he keeps his far side well hidden.

434
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,280
It still holds mysteries,

435
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,720
which will have to be studied in more
detail on future lunar missions.

436
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,960
For us humans, a flight
to the Moon needs good preparation.

437
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,840
Astronauts train for years for it.

438
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,240
The Moon is a place without air.

439
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,560
It isn't easy to talk
to each other there.

440
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,200
Because there's no sound.

441
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,960
Every word we speak

442
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,840
would be silent up there.

443
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:24,040
So astronauts can only speak

444
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,480
via radios.

445
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,200
Renzig residence, hello?

446
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,600
Hello?

447
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,440
Hello?

448
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,360
Weidkamp, I'd like to speak
to Dr. Renzig.

449
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,080
Hello, Mrs. Weidkamp.

450
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,720
-My husband is not on duty today.
-I know, but he did say I could call.

451
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,480
I see.

452
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,960
I...

453
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,680
I'll get him.
Wait a moment, please.

454
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,520
Hello, Mrs Weidkamp.

455
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,760
I'm ready.

456
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,080
OK.

457
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,360
Would you like to make your way
to the hospital?

458
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,280
-Yes.
-OK. I'll be there.

459
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,720
Minus 10.

460
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:07,280
9, 8, 7, 6...

461
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,880
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

462
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,200
Julie.

463
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,920
What is it?

464
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,240
What is it?

465
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,680
What is it?

466
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:17,240
The hospital called,
I have to spend the night there.

467
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,160
-I'll come with you.
-That's...

468
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,840
That's not necessary.

469
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,920
I'm going alone.
Could you maybe

470
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,000
wait at our house?

471
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,960
For three weeks they've been waiting

472
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,680
all of them,
at the hospital, for me.

473
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,400
For me to finally let you.

474
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,840
For me to finally say goodbye.

475
00:57:58,720 --> 00:57:59,800
And now?

476
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,520
Here I am.

477
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,760
And I can't say a word.

478
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,920
Just like you,
the past eighteen months.

479
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,680
Everything

480
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,280
just thoughts.

481
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,280
There's so much
I want to say to you.

482
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,800
But I can't.

483
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,000
Something is holding it inside me.

484
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,200
Holding it tight.

485
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,000
So now
I think I know what you mean.

486
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,200
How hard it is

487
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,640
to turn some thoughts into words.

488
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,440
We need a signature from you.

489
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:21,160
We have a chaplain in the hospital,
if you want.

490
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:30,680
OK, I'll...

491
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,800
I'll come back in a moment.

492
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,760
Could you pass on something
to Dr. Renzig from me?

493
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,960
I'd like to stay here.

494
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:02,920
I mean...

495
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,760
I mean, when it's time.
When...

496
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,240
When the machines
are switched off...

497
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,520
I'd like them to call me.

498
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:19,640
Is that possible?

499
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,080
And if...

500
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,440
If I don't answer, that means

501
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,680
I don't want to be there.

502
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,680
Don't want to be present.

503
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,840
OK.

504
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,440
Should the doctor come
and see you again?

505
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,360
Once the machines are switched off,

506
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,560
it happens quite fast.

507
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,400
From experience,
two or three minutes.

508
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,520
Can you hear me?

509
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,720
I've learnt a lot about the Moon.

510
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,360
How long it takes to get there.

511
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:01,360
That you have to go
through the darkness.

512
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,200
If it's true
that there's no air up there

513
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:10,640
and that it gets
"freezer-cold" there

514
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,760
and there are no sounds.

515
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,680
If it's true

516
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,920
that it's darker than any cellar there.

517
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:26,000
Then we have to start practising
in plenty of time.

518
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:56,240
I've talked to Flo.

519
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,320
She's been in her room for hours.

520
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,120
I'll stay with you for a few days.

521
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,280
I'd like to be alone.

522
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:35,440
Flo?

523
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,080
-Can I come in?
-Not possible!

524
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,960
-Why not, Flo?
-No air must come in.

525
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:57,560
For us humans, a flight
to the Moon needs good preparation.

526
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,440
Astronauts train for years for it.

527
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,760
The Moon is a place without air.

528
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,360
It isn't easy to talk
to each other there.

529
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,640
Because there's no sound.

530
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,960
Every word we speak

531
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,680
would be silent up there.

532
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:23,640
So astronauts can only speak

533
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:26,760
via radios.

534
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,120
My Daddy told me

535
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:42,080
that some of his thoughts
are like craters

536
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,200
he has to go into again and again.

537
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:49,200
There are many different kinds.

538
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,920
Small ones spread over
a large area.

539
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:57,520
And big ones
that are not so easy to avoid.

540
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:02,400
Most of all, though, he was afraid

541
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:06,360
of the deep ones
that come out of nothing.

542
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,160
Some so deep
that they'd swallow you up,

543
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,360
if you got too close.

544
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,000
That's why he was always
away a long time,

545
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:22,080
because he had to go through
these craters, he told me.

546
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,240
Mummy told me

547
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:33,200
that he experienced a lot of things
in another country

548
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,560
that he couldn't talk about.

549
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:38,280
Not even to her.

550
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,120
And where only doctors could help.

551
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,360
563 days I've been back.

552
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,280
Since my return.

553
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,600
And no week passes
without an incident.

554
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,880
It happens with incredible force.

555
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:09,160
And from one second to the next,
everything goes dark.

556
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,280
And you're amidst it all again,

557
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,960
as if it was happening
for the first time.

558
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:20,480
It's the first thing I feel:

559
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:23,120
A dull blow under my chest,

560
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:26,720
pressing through my body
again and again.

561
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,280
I know it's happening inside me,

562
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,880
but it feels

563
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:39,320
like it's happening miles away.

564
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:44,480
Hot air is forcing itself
into my lungs.

565
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,280
A shrill whistle pierces my head.

566
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,480
Try to get up,

567
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,800
but not a muscle moves.

568
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:00,640
I want to open my eyes,

569
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,360
or maybe they're long since open.

570
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,280
And everywhere these voices

571
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:11,040
and knowing who they are.

572
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,040
And in front of me

573
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,160
nothing but grey clouds.

574
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,000
Eternal moments till I understand,

575
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,800
until all the smoke and dust

576
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:26,240
resolves into
the first shapes again.

577
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,240
Right in front of me.

578
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,120
It...

579
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,280
It happens slowly,

580
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,960
like on a Polaroid.

581
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,520
And more come.

582
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,800
It never stops.

583
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:46,800
It...

584
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,120
There are no words

585
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,600
for what I've seen.

586
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,720
It takes me an eternity to tear myself
away from this sight.

587
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,960
To turn on my back.

588
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,280
Blue sky.

589
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:07,640
Clouds.

590
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,960
Birds flying by.

591
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,760
Till suddenly

592
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:17,000
it goes quiet.

593
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,240
I lie like this for days.

594
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,840
But later I learn

595
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,920
that it was only an hour.

596
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,600
A few fractures.

597
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,360
Nothing else gone.

598
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,760
I'm flown out of the country
the same day.

599
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,560
Home.

600
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,640
But it feels

601
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,320
like I never quite came back.

602
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,960
As if

603
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,880
part of me stayed behind there.

604
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:05,840
They say I was the only one
in my unit who survived.

605
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:11,240
And that it's a great miracle.

606
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:14,640
A unique miracle.

607
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,200
Day 576.

608
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,160
I...

609
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,160
I don't believe in miracles.

610
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,400
Can you hear me?

611
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,440
Mila's Mummy told me.

612
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:58,200
That you aren't just visiting
up there.

613
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,200
You're there forever.

614
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:05,800
Do you remember

615
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,880
telling me about the craters?

616
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:14,440
Mummy has read quite a lot to me
about the Moon.

617
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,680
You won't believe me,

618
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,200
but you really have to take care.

619
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:26,160
There are lots of them up there.

620
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:29,680
Deeper than any craters down here.

621
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:33,240
You have to be really careful.

622
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:38,360
Because nobody can help you
up there.

623
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,520
Not even me.

624
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:48,560
When I grow up, I'll visit you.

625
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,840
I'll become an astronaut

626
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:53,240
and fly to the Moon.

627
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:00,520
And we'll see each other again
and fly back.

628
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,720
Whether you believe it or not.

629
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:15,040
I do believe in miracles.

630
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:21,080
Take off minus 10, 9,

631
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:26,440
8, 7, 6, 5,

632
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:32,280
4, 3, 2, 1...

633
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:43,360
