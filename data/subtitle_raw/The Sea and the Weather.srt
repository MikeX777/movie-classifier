What is it, son? What is it?

Listen, mother,

my son is not you

Would you mind not going
to the academy this morning?

This morning? I'm sorry,
but it's impossible for me.

-Yes... Hurry up,
it's getting cold.

what the sultan orders,

but the favorite can order
whatever is put in her mouth.

Thank you.

So early in the morning?
And in the middle of the street?

call me back.

It's just that I'd rather we talk
before the demonstration,

Man, don't overdo it, Basilio,

in this house?

What do you want now, son?
Come in at once.

00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,980
But mother,
why didn't you get dressed up?

142

Don't you remember? Jesus is coming.

143
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,260
You are very small
and do not understand things.

If you had
the experience of the years...

145
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,140
What do I have to understand, mother?
Listen.

146

It's been a long time
since your brother left.

147
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,780
But now he wants to come back.
And they let him.

148
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,160

no one can do anything.

It stretches, it stretches.
It stretches like a rubber band,

152
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,700
but there comes a time,
that from so much stretching and stretching,

153
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,020
it breaks and then
you can no longer walk.

as soon as possible just in case.

No, but dinner at home tonight

00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,780
I suppose that at that hour
you won't be able to come.

162
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,780
Impossible. I have a lunch date
with the Frenchman

who brings the models from Biarritz.
And the Marquise.

164
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,020
And I have no way of notifying them,
because I don't know which hotel they've come to.

to take out of the window

those sell themselves.

00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,740
If it weren't for that,
I would go with you.

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,620
Hello, good morning.
(ALL GREETINGS)

170
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,300
What is happening?
Uncle Jesus is arriving now.

171
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,740
I no fancy dinner, but food.

172
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,300
This is the list of
of what you have to do

173
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,140
and this one,
the one about what I have to do.

174
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,460
Dad's orders.
Good thing I had asked permission

175
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,300
at the hotel not to go this morning.
-And what were you going to tell me?

176
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,340
Yes-what about the demonstration?
At least you're going.

177
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,020
-You're right, it's Monday.
The demonstration against the U.S..

178
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,380
-We do plan to go.
-Yes.

179
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,700
-I don't know now.
If Dicasa entertains me...

180
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,860
Well, what about the other thing?
What you had to tell me?

181
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,620
You see we are all in a hurry.
Can't you tell me anything

182
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,980
at long last?

183
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,100
-Can you play a record, please?
-Are you going to say it in song?

184
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,060
-No, man, it's the custom
that there is always music, isn't it?

185
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,340
(Music)

186
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,860
Well, Chus and I
have loved each other for some time

187
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,180
and it is normal for us to tell you
because among friends

188
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,940
you can't do a piggyback.

189
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,140
-You don't make me a pig,
but you give me a hard time,

190
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,980
because I still love Chus.

191
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,940
I think I've got it right, don't you?

192
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,740
-No one is to blame,
neither Mariano nor I are to blame,

193
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,700
You don't have it either.
-There is no such thing as guilt.

194
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,100
-Everything is the fruit of chance,
of chance and necessity.

195
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,660
-I agree.
-I think my behavior is good,

196
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,460
you can't deny it.
-Great, Anselmo.

197
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,220
-You may say that Anselmo Gato is a bad artist.
is a bad draftsman.

198
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,580
-No, not at all.

199
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,860
-But they will not be able to say
that he does not understand, that he does not assume.

200
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,580
Life is an open door,
many open doors.

201
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,300
Anselmo Gato's life is not a series of closing doors.
a series of doors that close,

202
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,260
is a series of doors
that open, open, open,

203
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,620
even if they open themselves to sorrow,
to failure, to contempt,

204
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,500
but they open, they open, they open.

205
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,580
And through them pass Anselmo Gato
with his drawing folders,

206
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,900
with their pencils, with their agenda
of girls' and editors' telephone numbers.

207
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,220
-But how handsome you are, Anselmo.
And how well made your head is.

208
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,820
-But there's one thing I don't understand.

209
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:27,820
Why did this motherfucker
insist that we get married?

210
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,140
Why?

211
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,180
Why?
-What does it matter now, Anselmo?

212
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,360
It's over.
-Overcome...

213
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,060
Cubism has been surpassed!
But what is going to be surpassed?

214
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,420
I think Chus is right about that.
Me too, of course.

215
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,580
-But do you realize
what I look like now

216
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,940
with my family,
with the neighbors, in the neighborhood?

217
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,380
If we hadn't married,
I'd be a tramp

218
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,260
that I had fucked the daughter of a "maître
of a "maître" and that was that.

219
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,700
But what am I now?

220
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,900
-You are a young man
with an impressive talent.

221
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,140
One of the best cartoonists
in the country.

222
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,700
-Yeah, that's for you, but for
for my parents' neighbors...

223
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,700
-You're getting out of control,
Anselmo, calm down.

224
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,740
That's right, take it easy,
it's no big deal.

225
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,020
If I am calm,
if I have assumed everything.

226
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,580
The only thing I want to know
is why is this motherfucker

227
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,340
was determined that we should get married.

228
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,580
-You are deliberately offending me.
-Well, but it's always the same.

229
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,820
-At meetings, I always see someone who deliberately
someone who deliberately offends.

230
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,820
-You offend me by using words
that we do not use.

231
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,420
As if you wanted to tell me
that I am not who I think I am,

232
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,420
that I'm nothing more than a whore
of the old ones.

233
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,740
-I didn't say that!
-You said it about his mother,

234
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,220
which is meaningless.

235
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,180
-What you have to ask yourself
is not why I insisted on getting married,

236
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,020
but why do I insist
now to leave you.

237
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,540
-But why are you getting so upset?
Everything was fine.

238
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,780
-I think for my part, yes.
-You've fit it.

239
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,620
-Mariano is intelligent,
he has literary culture,

240
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,260
is also a man of action
and on top of that he sings and plays the guitar.

241
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,860
How can I be surprised that a girl
that a girl wants to go with him?

242
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,940
And why shouldn't that girl
won't be mine?

243
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:02,660
But, Chus didn't want to tell me now
why she was going with Mariano,

244
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,980
but why he was leaving me.

245
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,420
-Because you're not funny, Anselmo.

246
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,340
(TITUBEA) -That I don't have...?
-Don't be cruel, Chus.

247
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,660
-Every day...
(IMITATES ARABIC)

248
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,060
With the towel and then,
the dance, Fred and Ginger.

249
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,620
So clumsy... Always the same.

250
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,340
-But in the beginning,
when we first met...

251
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,180
(SINGS IN ENGLISH)
-I didn't expect you to...

252
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,860
-You've gone too far, Chus.
Open doors, Anselmo.

253
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,180
You said it very well,
always open doors.

254
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,100
-Yes, the ones I go through
with my drawing folders,

255
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,540
my pencils...

256
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,500
-Anselmo, what are you saying?
-That's it!

257
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,700
That I will pass through all the doors
with my daughter!

258
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,580
Or do you want me
to give it to Mariano?

259
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,900
I do not believe in the law,
none of us believe in the law,

260
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,220
but now the law suits me
suits me because it supports me.

261
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,340
Or what do you want?
To be left alone altogether?

262
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,460
Without a child, without you, without a home...

263
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,500
Because the house is yours, of course.

264
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,220
-That doesn't matter now,
but yes, it is mine.

265
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,580
-Well, not the girl!

266
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,260
-Anselmo, the children are from the....
-The children are from the bottle!

267
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,700
And cows!
And Dr. Pasteur!

268
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,460
-What are you talking about?
He's gone crazy.

269
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,820
-What do you want?
Do you want me to stay alone forever?

270
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,540
Alone and with nothing?
No home, no memories...

271
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,900
-But this is my desk!
the place where I work!

272
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,620
And these, my drawings, my covers!
Work! These, these are!

273
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,420
-Stay still, Anselmo, please.

274
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,980
- "The Process", "City",
"Counterpoint",

275
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,220
"Heart," "Goodbye, doll."
-Calm down, Anselmo, calm down!

276
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,620
-Chus, you could have been
forever...

277
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,540
-Let me go, Anselmo!
-My wife!

278
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,060
And you won't be anymore! Huh? Not anymore!

279
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,300
-Anselmo!
-What are you doing?

280
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,820
-Watch out!
-He's going to jump!

281
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,580
-Anselmo, don't be crazy!
-No, Anselmo, no!

282
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,940
-Mariano, it helps a little, doesn't it?

283
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,580
It's just that I have to go
to the demonstration, it's time.

284
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,260
(Baby crying)

285
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,740
I want to kill myself!
I want to die! Die...

286
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,700
As I told you in the last letters,
I'm not doing too bad.

287
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,820
And neither did my daughters. The eldest...
Chus?

288
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,980
Yes, she has been made head of
of public relations at the hotel.

289
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
Your marriage is going very well.
It's hard enough.

290
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,620
Well, look at it, a thing like that,
sudden, precipitated,

291
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,900
pregnancy, and now it turns out
that everything is going smoothly.

292
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,660
They get along well, they understand each other,
they have the same ideas...

293
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,260
Plus, there's the little girl,
which has brought them very close together.

294
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,620
This highway was inaugurated in 1954.

295
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,500
I'm sure you didn't remember.
No.

296
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,500
But I do.
29 years in America, without returning.

297
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,140
But this one and this one
have not left Madrid.

298
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,740
Hey, what do you think they think here
of what we do abroad?

299
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,060
What about the work of the exiles?
What work?

300
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,260
The government of the Republic in exile
of the Republic in exile.

301
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,740
Because when Franco dies,
and it looks like he's not far off,

302
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,980
something will have to be done
and there we have a government.

303
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,340
Yes, of course.

304
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,540
And what we are most interested in knowing
is what young people think here.

305
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,740
Please think carefully about your answer.
What do young people think here

306
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,900
of the government
of the Republic in exile?

307
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,460
Young people?
Yes, the young people.

308
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,540
Nothing.

309
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,060
I would have liked so much to bring
my wife and my son...

310
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,300
But the kid, with college....

311
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,340
And well, since I can't
introduce you to my family,

312
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,980
at least I will meet yours.

313
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,060
They will all be at home
to welcome you.

314
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,660
The eldest, her husband,
the granddaughter, the little one,

315
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,420
and, of course, the mother.
She hasn't left the house for years.

316
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,180
Yes, I know.
They will all be there.

317
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,660
All of them. Except Marcela.

318
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,620
Yes, except Marcela.

319
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,020
Ma'am, may I make up your room?
Do what you want, but do something.

320
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,900
Who's there?
It's me, Grandma! It's Mer!

321
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,820
How is the soup coming along?

322
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,260
Well, you think I don't know how to skim a stew?
a stew?

323
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,660
And where is your father?
He had to go to the airport.

324
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,340
Well, the other days he leaves later.
Don't start the fuss now, Grandma.

325
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,700
The other days he has nothing to do until
to do until it's time for work.

326
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,700
Until 12 o'clock.
What do you have to do today?

327
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,620
Receive the guy, but he already knows.
What nonsense!

328
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,420
But your uncle drowned!
He drowned in the sea.

329
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,420
It's been so many years since he left.

330
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,260
Why haven't you put on
a dress?

331
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,420
This is what you look like.
This is a dress.

332
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,660
What's your father wearing?
I didn't notice.

333
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,980
It seems to me the same as always.

334
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,740
My son Jesus always dressed
with pants, jacket and tie.

335
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,860
We were poor.
Much poorer than now.

336
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,620
I've heard you tell it.

337
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,300
But Jesus, in spite of that
and his ideas,

338
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,260
which, it must be said, he always wore a tie,
always wore a tie.

339
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,860
Like his father, may he be glorified.

340
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,660
Now these things
are of no importance.

341
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,380
Everyone goes as he/she pleases.

342
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,740
Hey, we would be
whatever we were,

343
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,260
but we were not espadrille people.

344
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,020
Do you know if your father
wore a bow tie today?

345
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,900
He wears it only to work.
He must be very distinguished

346
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:42,780
with the bow tie, but since
you don't want to take me to see it...

347
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,700
The restaurant where he works is
far away, we have already told you.

348
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,980
Well, he could wear it at home

349
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,180
and serve the table one day
so that I could see him.

350
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,700
And if there were still miracles
and one day my son Jesus would come back...

351
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,940
We should have a dinner party here
in style, don't you think?

352
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,700
And my other son, your father,
would serve her.

353
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:15,060
Grandma, listen.
Uncle Jesus is coming back today.

354
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,540
What bullshit are you talking about?
Please don't start.

355
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,180
But do you think I'm going to believe
your lies?

356
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,900
Go fuck yourself!

357
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,380
Grandma, I have to ask you something.
Let's see.

358
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,860
Dad wants you to come back
to see your son Jesus

359
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,940
after so many years
don't swear at him.

360
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,940
But how can I swear at him
if he's my son?

361
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,980
Who the fuck is going to come now
to give us a hard time?

362
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,300
Hello.
What, has the traveler arrived yet?

363
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,300
No, not yet.
I come not only for a moment

364
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,100
to meet him and give him a hug.

365
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,820
I do not recognize anything.

366
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,580
When we were kids
we used to come to Barajas

367
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,660
to visit Aunt Encarna.

368
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,300
He would give us slices of bread with honey.
Yes.

369
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,580
The old road runs
on the other side, all this is new.

370
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,740
And why did I come back
if everything is different?

371
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,540
To take a few years off
off, don't you think?

372
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,100
You are right.

373
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,300
I've been here less than an hour
and I already feel younger.

374
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,620
Before heading home
we will stop by the boutique

375
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,220
to meet Lupe.
Just passing by.

376
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,740
I think that the color of your eyes
the one that suits you best is this one, green.

377
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,660
Oh, excuse me, Lali, beautiful.
It's just a moment,

378
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,180
but I warn you that it is
the one that will suit you best

379
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,980
and what we have received from Biarritz,
all in shades of green.

380
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,580
Nacha, monkey, stop that,
you'll make out with anything.

381
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,620
Teaches the lady from Callejanos,
who arrived yesterday from London.

382
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,460
-They're downstairs, do you want to come?
-Yes, let's go.

383
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,020
-Joyful surprise.
Very happy and very surprise.

384
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,540
I thought you were coming here,
but in the afternoon.

385
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,660
We've only been here for a moment
because I wanted to introduce you to...

386
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,860
Just arrived from Argentina, right?
Yes, just arrived.

387
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,580
My brother Jesus,
Lupe, my partner.

388
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,900
Hello, Jesus.
Hello.

389
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,700
Keko, this is Eusebio's brother.

390
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,540
After 1000 years
across the sea

391
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,340
has dared to come and see
how his countrymen are now.

392
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,660
Jesús Muñiz, insurance agent,
businessman,

393
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,540
Spanish, resident in Argentina.
Keko, Marquis of Pradobajo,

394
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,700
and first of all, a good friend.
Tomorrow you will come by here, Jesus,

395
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,620
and we'll talk about your wife,
okay?

396
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,500
Did he show you
those who arrived yesterday?

397
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,980
There are some that are a love.

398
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,740
What was your impression?
Very good impression.

399
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,740
You can see her awake, active...

400
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,460
Hey, what about that spot on the guitar?
What is the marquis doing there?

401
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,140
Ah, it's one of Nacha's flirts,
that employee, she sits and plays.

402
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,340
But Lupe is too young for you,
isn't she? There is a big difference.

403
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:43,380
Oh, yeah? I hadn't noticed.
(LAUGHS) You're a pion. Always the same.

404
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:47,620
I put it here
so that you can see it as soon as you enter.

405
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,180
It is what he liked the most,
quince jelly.

406
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:56,940
Do you also think
your mother is an imbecile?

407
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,140
No, she is an ordinary woman.

408
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,020
My Eusebio thinks
that I don't know anything.

409
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:06,140
If you want an aniseed, help yourself.
Well, thank you.

410
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:12,220
Today my son arrives, you know? The eldest.
Now he's just coming to take a look around,

411
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,900
but as soon as he dies
who I know

412
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,660
will return to stay in Spain.

413
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,140
The broth is very good,
but it lacks a little salt, Grandma.

414
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,820
Miracle would be.

415
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,780
Look, this is my Jesus.

416
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,540
Yeah, I've seen it before.

417
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:36,260
Now it will be older, because
the photo is many years old.

418
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,860
He had to flee
because he lost a war.

419
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,220
He went into the sea...
Chus says to put

420
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,180
these two bottles of y
on the sideboard.

421
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,060
Shut the fuck up!

422
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,780
He went into the sea on one side
And wham, it came out the other!

423
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,260
Where he could no longer be caught.

424
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,060
(SIGHS)

425
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,820
I should comb my hair
a little for when he comes,

426
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:05,580
But I don't know what to leave you alone.
It's not polite.

427
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,260
Oh, don't do it for me,
besides, I can go to the kitchen

428
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,940
to help her granddaughters and Trini.

429
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,700
Very nice girl that Trini, isn't she?

430
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,140
But what a belly she has,
Is it your husband's?

431
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,540
Yes, of course.

432
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,660
We are now reaching out
to our neighborhoods.

433
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,140
You recognize them, don't you?
This is the traffic circle.

434
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,700
But they removed the statue.
Yes, a few years ago.

435
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,540
She was taken
to the gardens of the Canal.

436
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,180
Where were we going to play?
There.

437
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,220
Do you remember? He was a man in a frock coat
and if you looked at him from the side,

438
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,860
it looked as if he had his gag out.
Of course I remember.

439
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,780
We kids would come to see it.
It was a finger, but it looked like the ginga.

440
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,220
-Yes, he is much better, calmer.

441
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,260
Yes, in one hour we give
the child to the second bottle.

442
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,900
That if you are going to receive your uncle.
-That man is no longer my uncle!

443
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,580
-I hear you, I hear you.

444
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,820
Sorry, Pepe,
but they have just arrived.

445
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,420
Well, here we have...
Let me.

446
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,220
Please let me.

447
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,420
You are Mer, the youngest.
And you are Chus, the eldest.

448
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,700
No, uh...
But I didn't know you were waiting.

449
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,660
And you didn't tell me anything!
No, listen, Jesus.

450
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,300
And you are Anselmo,
Chus' husband

451
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,860
and the father of the child
and come on, of everything that comes.

452
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,900
Listen, Jesus, you're wrong.

453
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,580
This is not my little daughter.
What is she, the maid? You have a maid?

454
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,900
No, we have an assistant,
but it's not this one.

455
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,300
Why do you insist on guessing?
I don't know, it just came out that way,

456
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,980
but I ask for forgiveness, I remain silent.

457
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,420
Look, this is Chus.

458
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,140
Chus, dear niece, forgive me.
It's just that I'm so excited...

459
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,860
Thanks for confusing me with Chus,
I've been with him for a few years.

460
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,020
And Anselmo?
He couldn't come, I'll explain later.

461
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,340
And Mom? I can't wait to see her.

462
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,820
You must be very careful
at this first meeting,

463
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,220
that it does not affect you too much.

464
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,940
Better make it a short interview
and let's all chat.

465
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,300
Trini is a psychiatrist,
she understands these things.

466
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,100
Not a psychiatrist, a psychoanalyst.

467
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,700
-My name is Mariano Andrade,
and here I am just a friend.

468
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,580
I have come to speak to you
not only for me,

469
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,820
but on behalf of a great many
who think like me.

470
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,420
Although we were born many years after the war
after the war,

471
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,380
we are with all
those who were like you,

472
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,820
we understand them
and thank them for what they did.

473
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,500
Even if it later turned out
what it turned out to be.

474
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,180
Thank you, my boy. Thank you very much.

475
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:36,660
Mother, your son Jesus has arrived.

476
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,300
But you get nervous, huh?

477
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,860
The doctor wants you
you to always be very calm.

478
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,700
Why should I get nervous
if I already knew it was coming today?

479
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:52,060
Mother, your son Jesus. My brother.

480
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,100
Mom...

481
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,420
Good morning, how are you?

482
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,980
Grandma...

483
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,700
Grandma, it's your son Jesus.
The one who left during the war.

484
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,300
Yeah, you already told me that.

485
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,500
And you greet him like this,
as if he were a stranger?

486
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,580
It seems to me that I have received you
with very good manners.

487
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,740
But you don't have to go overboard.

488
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,220
Aren't you going to at least
give him a hug?

489
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,540
Of course, of course, of course.

490
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,940
How many years I've been
I've been wanting to give it to him!

491
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:34,220
My son, my son, my son! My Jesus!

492
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,380
Forgive this poor old woman,
forgive me.

493
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,620
Blame it on the damn years,
I don't know what I do to myself.

494
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:48,140
My head, you know?
It doesn't work well, they must have told you.

495
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,540
That's why I couldn't write to you.
Mom, Mom...

496
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,220
(CRIES) My son, my son of my soul....

497
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,900
Oh, Jesusín!
Sit her down, she'd better sit down.

498
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,380
I couldn't come earlier, Mom.

499
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:22,020
I know, I know that they were after you
as if you were a criminal.

500
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,900
My Jesusín, a criminal...

501
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:29,820
But you lifted the skin of the sea
and covered yourself with it

502
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,780
so that the lights wouldn't hit you
and the dogs wouldn't smell you

503
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,020
with those who pursued you.

504
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,820
(CRIES)

505
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,140

(Clock)

507
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,100
Hey, Eusebio, it's too much for her.
Jesus should go away for a while.

508
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,780
You'll want to get some rest,
open your bags.

509
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,300
Yes, yes, I have brought
some things I want to show you.

510
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,660
Ven.

511
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,620
It's this way, Uncle Jesus,
the first door.

512
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,180
Wait, I'll bring the suitcase.

513
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,660
Here, Grandma, drink some water.
Thank you, Mer, you're in everything.

514
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,980
The decoration will surprise you a little.

515
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,540
It is Mer's room.

516
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,700
He is very cheerful, very friendly.

517
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:28,420
But this man
what the hell is my son going to be?

518
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,660
Mom, what do you say?

519
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,580
Do you want to make me take communion
with a millstone?

520
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,620
But...
I have made the pamema

521
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,460
not to disappoint the poor gentleman.

522
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:44,020
Who is this guy, Eusebio?
Where did you get him from?

523
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,820
He's a comedian,
he sure is a comedian.

524
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,500
How can he be a comedian, mother?

525
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,700
How much did you give him for coming here
to be a jerk?

526
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,900
No, Mother, he's not a comedian. He's a...
You must have met him at the restaurant,

527
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,260
as if he saw it,
and you will have paid him with dinner,

528
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,980
because those bastards
always go to the fourth question.

529
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:09,300
But you haven't even looked
the box of quince jelly.

530
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,540
And where would my Jesusín's gaze have gone
my Jesusín's gaze?

531
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:19,660
To the quince jelly, then.
Come here, Mer. Come here.

532
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,380
That you deceive me less
than the others.

533
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,380
What do you want?

534
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,580
Have you seen that you have brought
a sucker home

535
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,420
to make me believe that my Jesus...
No, Grandma, it's him.

536
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,980
Do you also want to entangle me?

537
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,220
This was your friend Trini's doing,
the doctor of the crazies.

538
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,140
Of course, with this fantasy,

539
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,860
he thinks he's going to cure me
of I don't know what.

540
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,180
No, Mrs. Eusebia, it's not that.
But we already told you that.

541
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,900
Look, be careful,
I've had it up to here!

542
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,140
And I don't say up to my balls
so you don't say I'm foul-mouthed!

543
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,380
It's grandma, you know...
She gives it to her from time to time.

544
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,380
It has been many years
and he has suffered so much...

545
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,820
And that little snitch, who has
a faggot face from here to Lima...

546
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,740
Shut up, mother,
I beg you, please!

547
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,540
You tell him that if he dares
to stick his nose in my face again...

548
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,860
He's right next door, he's going to hear you.
That's what I want, for him to hear me!

549
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,660
Hey, how the old woman screams.
Yes, when she gets hit, she screams a lot.

550
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,900
If he sticks his nose in me again, I'll slap him!
I'll slap him!

551
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,300
Don't be bad, grandma, behave yourself.
Don't take me to see him, eh!

552
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,820
I'm telling you I don't want to see
that dumb ass!

553
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:33,140
That crazy faggot! That clown!
No, I don't want to see him anymore!

554
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:39,100
Lie down, grandma, lie down and rest.
Don't bring him here, don't bring him here!

555
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,700
(Phone)

556
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,860
Basilio has been arrested.
-No!

557
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,220
-Yes, his mother just called me.
-Why was that?

558
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:48,660
-Yesterday, at the demonstration.

559
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,460
We will have to call Anselmo,
to talk to his father.

560
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,140
He can give a touch to his friends,
like the other time.

561
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,460
-I am not going to call him,
for he is often with me.

562
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,940
One of you call him.
-I'll call him.

563
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,620
-Have you been beaten?
-I don't know anything.

564
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,780
And neither does his mother, you understand.

565
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,300
(WHISPERING) -But how can you think of calling this house
to call this house for such a thing?

566
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,020
You know how my father is
and now he won't even talk to me.

567
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,940
Well, the best thing you can do
is to call Eusebio.

568
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:16,940
If you call him as soon as possible,
you might catch him at home.

They are the gardens
of the Canal de Isabel II!

Of course! Of course it's the gardens
Can't you see, man?

587
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,940
I remembered them differently.

588
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,540
How different!

How things change,

Well, the truth is that also
the gardens have changed.

593
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,700
Do you remember, Eusebio?

594
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,780
The rich kids
had a little card

595
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,180
and accompanied by a family member
or by the maid

596
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:44,300
They would come in through the front door.
And us, the street kids,

597
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,620
we would sneak in from behind.
We would jump the fence,

598
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:50,220
we would get into the pipes
and a lame guard insulted us.

threw stones at us!

And we him!
(THEY LAUGH)

602
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,540

sometimes we were accompanied by a girl.

Yes, some.

Yes, Marcela.

605
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,380
I was twelve years old
and was already attracting attention.

606
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,460
Well, and there you have
what you wanted to see.

607
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,220
The statue?
Yes, the statue in the gazebo,

608
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:17,620
that brought her here.

You can't even see his guts.

612
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:39,140
It is necessary to get more here.

613
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,820
But, Eusebio,
you can't see anything from here!

614
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,660
They covered it with the tree.

615
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,380
Yes, it is true.
They must have done it on purpose.

616
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,980
They covered it with the tree.
They change everything!

Mr. Eusebio Muñiz has not yet come
yet, but he should be coming soon.

00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,260
-He hasn't arrived yet.
Well, I can't stand it here anymore

621
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,940
without doing anything, seeing that Basilio
is in the dungeon.

622
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:28,740
Where are you going?
That way, to look for friends.

623
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,740
I'm going to go to the tavern,
see if I can find Lucas.

624
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,780
This was not there, did you see?
Over there the places are gray,

625
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,140
unpalatable, you know what I mean?
Yes, I get the idea.

626
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,380
Then it gets really busy.
The food is not bad

627
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,900
and the prices are affordable
affordable for all budgets.

628
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:59,300
Do you have specialties?
Yes, every day,

hen in pepitoria
and stewed tortilla

630
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,340
and on Thursdays, stew.
Stew!

00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,580
Do you remember, Eusebio,
the old lady's stew?

632
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,940
How can I remember?
We ate it every day.

00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,380
Thank you, Lupe.
Yes, but we

652
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,060
we didn't come to talk to you
about any of that.

653
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:06,700
Is anybody there?
No one.

654
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,300
Basilio was arrested
at yesterday's demonstration.

655
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,660
What sons of bitches.
-Again? Don't tell me...

656
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,700
Yes, I wanted to ask you...
Veronica, call Leticia.

657
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,340
It is a pity that Yolanda
is in Marbella.

658
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,300
But Leticia will find
Vicky or La Negra.

659
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,460
Of course also Yolanda
from Marbella...

660
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,900
Maybe Nicolás is there.
-Leticia on the phone.

661
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,580
-What's up, Leticia? How's it going with you?

662
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,260
He's a pimp, I warned you.

663
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,620
Well, Leticia, cut the crap.

664
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,860
You have to look for
Vicky or La Negra.

665
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,460
No, I don't need coke.

666
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,500
The one you find, you tell her
to call the sheriff as soon as possible.

667
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,940
Yes, that's right. Have them call me.

668
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,100
Warn them that it is
that Alfonso

669
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,700
owes the magistrate a touch.

670
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,900
It's nothing to do with drugs, dammit!

671
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,380
You, Eusebio, to look for Cuqui,
at this hour, at her house,

672
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:58,380
or if not, at the Moroco, rehearsing.
Have him call me as soon as possible.

673
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,540
Well, after walking back and forth
back and forth,

674
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,860
now, sit for a while
and wait for news.

675
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:06,780
For me, these walks
are very good for me.

676
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,780
This is how I get to know
the Madrid of today.

677
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,140
I have little time left, at 8 o'clock I have to be at the restaurant.
I have to be at the restaurant.

678
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,020
I believe that a matter like this
can be resolved in three hours.

679
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:17,500
There, with Onganía...

680
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:21,580
Here with Lupe you never know
what can happen.

681
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,900
A cognac?
Good.

682
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,300
It's a jewel, man.
Who is it?

683
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:35,500
Your mine.
Ah, she's not stupid. And she's related.

684
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,740
I've seen it, I've seen it.
Because of his work, you understand?

685
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:41,780
And I take charge, you meet people,
suppliers, friendships are made.

686
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,700
He also knows many models.

687
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,940
He organizes fashion shows
in Barcelona, in San Sebastian...

688
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,940
Meet the best women
in Spain.

689
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,620
(LAUGHTER) The flag ones,
as we were saying before.

690
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,220
I imagine.
Some are not models,

691
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,100
are girls who want to earn money
any way they can because they need it.

692
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:05,740
And Lupe helps them. She also rubs elbows
with the aristocracy,

693
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,140
with executives,
political leaders of the situation,

694
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,900
businessmen
who do not want to travel alone,

695
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,300
about stress
and relaxation, you know?

696
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,220
Yes, yes, I think I understand
what you are saying.

697
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,460
And it puts them in contact
with each other.

698
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,820
Some with others, I mean.
Right, right.

699
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,500
But then, according to
to what you say,

700
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,860
your friend Lupe...
No, my partner.

701
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:32,100
Sorry, yes,
your partner Lupe, she is a mediator.

702
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,660
How?
It's...

703
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:40,220
She is a procurer.
Ah, yes, yes! That's it.

704
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,540
And you say so?

705
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,940
You will get to know her.

706
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,020
Don't worry about me, Eusebio.
Not if I don't worry.

707
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,140
Neither for my wife nor for my son.

708
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:58,100
I educated them in freedom,
in understanding,

709
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,140
and when they come here,
they are going to treat it.

710
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:03,100
Yes, it can be very useful.

711
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:07,060
I'm not scared of anything.
Man, I guess.

712
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:11,180
After the war and exile
and Franco and Perón and Onganía,

713
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,900
these things...
Yes...

714
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,980
(Radio)

715
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,860
If I were to tell you, Eusebio,
how my early days were

716
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:32,260
in Buenos Aires, when, despite the opposition of the
the opposition of the Argentine government,

717
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:34,580
we arrived a lot of exiles
of exiles all at once...

718
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,180
They are rehearsing.

719
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,020
It was necessary to defend oneself
in any way.

720
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,100
It was necessary to subsist.

721
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,460
I was a cafisio, that's why I tell you
that for me these things...

722
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,460
Let's see, let's see,
I don't know if I understood you correctly.

723
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:51,660
What did you say you were? Cafisio?
Cafisio.

724
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,100
You've never heard that word
in the tangos?

725
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:56,140
It's that I don't like tangos...
Me neither.

726
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:59,100
Always the same nonsense
with the zeros, the tears...

727
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:03,980
But what you did when you arrived
to Buenos Aires, the cafisio thing,

728
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,900
What does that mean?
Pimp.

729
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:11,260
Pimp of whores.
What are you talking about!

730
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,580
That you were a pimp?
But only for a season.

731
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,900
But you were
the shyest guy in the neighborhood.

732
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,740
If women,
especially the pretty ones,

733
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,460
you were more afraid of them
than the fascists.

734
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,420
Yes, life rules, man.

735
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:25,820
Hunger takes away the fear
even the most chicken.

736
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:29,020
And then I didn't have a bad plant,
I walked with the tire on the ground.

737
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:32,540
(LAUGHTER) Jesusín, cafisio
in Buenos Aires.

738
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,540
In La Boca they called me
"el galleguito" (the little Galician).

739
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:38,060
(LAUGHS) Unbelievable!

740
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,060
Even if it had been me...
Oh! You were so much more daring.

741
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:46,300
But there was Marcela.
Yes, it changed me a lot.

742
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:50,300
If it hadn't been for her, maybe
I would have gone into exile like you.

743
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,740
And then, you see.

744
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:56,260
And why did you split up?
If you don't mind talking about it.

745
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:57,740
No, no, I don't care.

746
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,620
Well, because of the usual,
we didn't understand each other.

747
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,140
They always say the same thing,
don't give me that.

748
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,540
There are couples who have spent years
without understanding each other,

749
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:06,980
and they don't even need to.

750
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:11,340
Well, then she
took to drinking.

751
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,780
When she got drunk
anyone could do with it

752
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,140
whatever he wanted.

753
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:19,180
I wasn't a saint either.
Eusebio!

754
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,260
The old woman is calling.
Eusebio!

755
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,500
Eusebio, for fuck's sake! Do you want to come?
Hey, how it gets.

756
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,420
Yes, when it hits her, she gets angry.

757
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,780
What do you want, mother?
Come closer, son, come closer.

758
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:38,100
Who the hell is with you that has been
there for half an hour of chitchat?

759
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,580
Is he the clown?
No, it's one of the waiters.

760
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:45,180
Paco, the eldest.
Do you swear to me?

761
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:47,100
I swear.

762
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,740
One should not swear in vain,
but to say "yes" or "no".

763
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,140
as Christ teaches us.
Mother...

764
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,140
Did I hurt you?
No, you haven't hurt me.

765
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,540
Why don't you fire him?
I'm sure he's a freeloader.

766
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,220
No, he is not a freeloader, nor a clown.

767
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,700
He is my brother,
your son Jesus, Jesusín.

768
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,940
I'll give you another slap.

769
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,620
Well, I'm going with him, Mother.
I don't like to leave him alone.

770
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,140
Go wherever you want.

771
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,180
You men always do
what comes out of your fly.

772
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,660
What did the old lady want?
Nothing, nothing, it's her time.

773
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,460
In the late afternoon
it almost always starts to rave.

774
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:30,660
Poor thing...
Oh, Jesusín...

775
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,620
When you were a pimp
in Buenos Aires,

776
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,780
do you know what I lived on?
No, you didn't tell me.

777
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,500
You wrote to me: "I'm doing well,
I'm not doing badly, I'm defending myself"...

778
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,060
Yes, of course, because of censorship.
They opened the letters.

779
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,500
Well, he lived on the black market.

780
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,300
Were you a smuggler, Eusebio?

781
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,660
With the Barajas family.

782
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:55,620
I did a lot of egg selling,
bread, milk, whatever there was.

783
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:58,340
Then I got in touch with
with more important people

784
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:00,380
and I switched to tobacco smuggling.

785
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,020
That's how I defended myself
for two or three years

786
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:05,460
until I became a waiter.

787
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,340
And then, to take that small
part in the restaurant business,

788
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,740
Do you know who helped me?
No, you didn't write it to me.

789
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,140
Opus Dei.
Opus Dei?

790
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,180
Yes, I've been in the business, little one,

791
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,700
and the head chef,
another, also small,

792
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,460
but we have an equity partner
and that equity partner,

793
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,860
a guy with a lot of money,
he's Opus Dei.

794
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,580
You with Opus Dei?

795
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:34,180
What are you telling me?
I can't believe it!

796
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,540
Hey, Jesusín!
You were a cafisio in La Boca!

797
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:38,420
No shit...
It's not the same thing!

798
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,340
It's not the same, man!
You're not going to compare!

799
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,180
(Doorbell)

800
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,940
This is Lupe, for sure.

801
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,620
Great news.

802
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:55,020
All better than we thought.

803
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,260
Sorry, Jesus,
I've neglected you a little.

804
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,620
Hello.

805
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:02,580
But because of the child in detention,
I haven't taken care of most of yours.

806
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:03,940
Here.

807
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:07,140
This is a list of the premises
that are for sale or for lease.

808
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:09,700
Red stripe, transfers;
blue, sales.

809
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,540
For starters, better transfers.

810
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,860
I hope you...
Oh, yes.

811
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:16,980
This is one of the possible clients
I can introduce to your wife.

812
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,940
Rosa. Here you have
some addresses and telephone numbers.

813
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,460
Paris, Biarritz, Milan, London,
very useful.

814
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,460
Amarilla, here are the procedures
to open the premises.

815
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,420
There has been a lot of luck, Eusebio,

816
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,140
Basilio may already be on the street.

817
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,420
Tell me about it tomorrow,
now I have to prepare

818
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:36,180
Grandma's dinner.
Isn't Mer coming?

819
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:39,420
He called me to decide that I couldn't,
because I was walking from one place to another

820
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:40,740
with Basilio.

821
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:45,300
I am amazed,
what a woman Icasia is, huh?

822
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:46,700
Active.

823
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,460
And why doesn't she live here with you?
Because of the child.

824
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,460
I don't think it's right, do you understand?

825
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,620
We see each other every day,
but in his apartment.

826
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:57,620
Does Lupe have a girl?
No, by Mer.

827
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,980
And also for our mother.
But what are you telling me?

828
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:05,020
Yes, Mer is a very evolved girl
and the old one is always on cloud nine.

829
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,260
Have you taken a look at
at the transfers?

830
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,820
Does any of them suit you?
Very much so.

831
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,220
The only thing I can tell you
is that the prices

832
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:13,860
are higher
than I thought.

833
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:15,940
In addition, how is the weight
with the change.

834
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,580
That's right, 350 with the dollar
and 480 with the peseta.

835
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,140
Take your time.

836
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:22,220
If you need money,
you can ask for a loan.

837
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:25,100
It's just that I could be inconvenienced,
being a newcomer.

838
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,900
Instead of a bank,
you can ask a private individual.

839
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:29,300
And you know?

840
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,820
If you leave me a few days
to do the math,

841
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:34,660
I may be able to lend it to you
lend it to you depending on the amount

842
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,300
and at a lower interest rate
than any loan shark.

843
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,820
As long as you have something under warranty
to respond.

844
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:42,020
Among friends,
clarity comes first.

845
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:47,300
Are you a lender?
He helps people.

846
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:51,020
I knew about the change in the peso.
It is that it plays something in the stock market.

847
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:52,820
(Doorbell)

848
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,780
Leave it, Eusebio, I'll get it.

849
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,300
Here is the outlaw.

850
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,540
-Thank you, Lupe.
I guess it was you.

851
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,620
-It has been friendships
and chance, as always.

852
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,420
First of all, I wanted to come
to thank you.

853
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,340
It doesn't matter,
as long as you can.

854
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:19,820
Come in and sit down.
This is my brother, there is trust.

855
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,700
Hello.
The exile? The anarchist?

856
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:26,220
That was a long time ago.
I was looking forward to meeting him.

857
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:29,780
A cognac?
Thank you, Eusebio, I don't drink alcohol.

858
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,980
Coca Cola, if possible.
-I'll get it for you.

859
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,660
So I take a peek
at the soup.

860
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,180
There, in Argentina, there is also
a great university agitation.

861
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:39,980
And all over the world.
I am not a university student.

862
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,940
It doesn't matter, you are young
and it's the young

863
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,260
those who are making
the great world revolution.

864
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:46,620
No one can stop this.

865
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:50,060
What we couldn't do,
they are doing it now.

866
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,140
You should have gone earlier
to see your parents.

867
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:55,140
I'll be right there, but first
I wanted to thank you.

868
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:58,980
Mer is not here?
No, she is not here.

869
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:02,140
Me too, as soon as
I'm leaving as soon as I give Grandma her dinner.

870
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:03,700
I have to stop by Chicote.

871
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:06,820
Tomorrow comes the party
and they need marijuana.

872
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:12,180
A real marvel, Mabel.

873
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,180
I feel so sorry for you
that you and the boy didn't come.

874
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,460
Of course,
the streets have changed.

875
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,380
The houses in which we
we used to live in,

876
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,220
the one that I told you was
like a huge tenement

877
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,540
and who called them
The houses of Carlos March,

878
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:27,460
because all of us who lived there
in it were socialists

879
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:28,780
or communists or anarchists.

880
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,740
They still exist,
but how businesses have changed,

881
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,060
other.

882
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:35,380
Eusebio's house,
although it is in the same neighborhood,

883
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:36,940
was built in the postwar period.

884
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,780
No, not only the street is changed,
the whole city.

885
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,940
Except for the downtown neighborhoods.

886
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,780
But the people, Mabel,
are still the same.

887
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,700
The best you can meet,
I assure you.

888
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,700
Have you been to the Romesa agency?

889
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,820
Yes, they took care of me
wonderfully well.

890
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,620
That friend of yours is charming.

891
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,740
This location was provided to me by him.

892
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,620
As soon as I showed him your little card,
he went out of his way to serve me.

893
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:01,940
Now, for the good places,
they ask you for a lot of money.

894
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:04,580
In addition, here in Spain
the taste for dressing was lost.

895
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,780
The fashion for women to dress in dirty rags
with dirty rags, with scraps of cloth,

896
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:09,780
with old dresses.
Did you see, hey?

897
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,500
Hi, daddy.
Hello.

898
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,620
And Uncle Jesus?

899
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,860
He is not here, he has gone to see
to Vallecas,

900
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,020
I was very interested.
I slipped away.

901
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:24,460
So, no one is there?
No, of course, just grandma.

902
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,860
Better.

903
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,260
Dad.

904
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,260
I have to ask you a question.
Ah, so ask me.

905
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,860
Do you remember Pita?

906
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,780
Pita? So, for the moment, I don't fall for it.
Who is it?

907
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,780
Well, it's the same.

908
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,860
The fact is that...

909
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:44,620
Pita, a friend of mine,
has a pretty big problem

910
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:47,860
and she needs me to help her.
So help her, if you can,

911
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:49,980
as long as you don't get yourself
in a commitment.

912
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,340
It's not a drug thing?
No, no, no.

913
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,460
I get the impression
that you're beating around the bush.

914
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,260
She needs someone
to accompany her to London,

915
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,340
because he has to go to London,
you know?

916
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:03,940
No, I didn't.
I find you strange.

917
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:06,340
You have always spoken to me
clearly.

918
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:07,980
(Music)

919
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,580
I just don't know how to do this, Dad.
What's that?

920
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:16,060
Lying to you.
I'm not surprised, you're out of practice.

921
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,980
I feel kind of embarrassed.

922
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,500
That's easy to fix,
don't lie to me.

923
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,380
I am pregnant.

924
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,620
From Mariano?
Yes.

925
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,820
Does he know?
Yes.

926
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:31,580
What about your husband?
We haven't told him yet.

927
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,660
What for?
Yes, you're right, what for?

928
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,500
And how did Mariano take it?
Normal.

929
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:39,900
Are you going to get it?

930
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:42,540
Mariano says that whatever I say
will be fine with him.

931
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,220
I thought the best thing to do
is to take it off.

932
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:47,900
For that I need to go to London.

933
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:49,780
Pita will accompany me

934
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,140
and we thought we'd tell you about it,
but the other way around.

935
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:54,140
Maybe you don't need
to go that far,

936
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:56,260
here they do it very well
and you wouldn't be so lonely.

937
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:57,980
You have Mer,
me and Lupe.

938
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,460
But it's dangerous here,
it is forbidden.

939
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:01,820
Prohibited.

940
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:03,620
It is much more expensive.

941
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,300
But is Mariano poor?

942
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,300
Why did you want to deceive me?
Well...

943
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,220
The truth is that only for one thing.

944
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,300
To save you the trouble,
the worry.

945
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:28,300
I know that's what bothers you the most,
but I didn't know how to do it.

946
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:31,300
Thank you for trying.

947
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,460
And for knowing me.

948
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,700
(Music)

949
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:42,340
Where are you going this afternoon?
Out and about, aimlessly.

950
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,740
You agreed that you would come back to see
those from Vallecas.

951
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:47,300
Yes, I told them I would come back,
but I don't feel like it.

952
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:50,180
If you want to know the truth,
I haven't seen them for years.

953
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,260
I found them so old,
so different.

954
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,220
Years of waiting to see them and then
we had nothing to say to each other.

955
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,980
The children, the young people,
just like yesterday, another world.

956
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,180
Today, because of Chus
I can't move from here,

957
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:01,980
I have to keep an eye on the phone.
the phone.

958
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,980
Don't worry about me,
I have a great time

959
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,100
wandering around this Madrid
I don't know.

960
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,060
Want to play some mus?
We are missing the fourth.

961
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:09,580
Do you still play mus?
Sometimes.

962
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,700
Hey, gentleman,
in case you don't know,

963
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:15,060
mus is not a fashion,
it's a man's thing.

964
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:17,900
Did you forget during this time?
You were not bad at it.

965
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,140
Come on, Paco, you accelerate
there are many of them.

966
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:22,900
I finished it off and took out the card.

967
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:25,220
Besides, I taught my wife and the kid how to play.
and the kid.

968
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:29,140
Hala, my brother dares
with us. He is a fool.

969
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,540
I haven't played for years.

970
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:33,060
In addition, the same thing happened to us
the same as you,

971
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:34,780
we were almost always missing the fourth.

972
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,900
The two brothers against us
or would you rather we kick out kings?

973
01:05:39,420 --> 01:05:40,900
This does not run in the family,
to kings.

974
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,580
How are things going
in your country?

975
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,780
Yeah, but he's been there so long,
and then the accent.

976
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,140
Can you tell?

977
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:52,260
It reminds a little bit of Carlos Gardel,
but otherwise nothing.

978
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:54,700
Come on you and me,
let's get off our asses.

979
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:57,820
Things are going wrong everywhere.

980
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:00,140
Today, as soon as I woke up,
I read in the newspaper

981
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:02,460
that because of that nigger
who was killed the other day...

982
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:03,780
Luther King.

983
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:05,940
That the other blacks
have taken to the streets.

984
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:10,140
They kill, they set on fire, the black hurricane
the newspaper calls it.

985
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,660
And in Vietnam they have cracked.

986
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,620
Come on, the Americans have lost the war
have lost the war

987
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:17,020
against a bunch of Chinese.

988
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:18,820
I think they are giving
the gasp.

989
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:21,940
-Is that because things are going badly?
Maybe they're going great.

990
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,460
-You don't need to be right.
Do you know the address?

991
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,660
For 31, it winks,
the average,

992
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,660
the duplexes...

993
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,740
For you the car.
We'll make do with those.

994
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:33,180
But I know them all.

995
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:37,940
Medina showed them to us,
the cleaner of the European Café.

996
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:41,620
You just follow my lead
and at the slightest doubt you will be consulted.

997
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:45,180
We've got it licked.
Sucked.

998
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,700
Did you hear, Eusebio,
what my partner said?

999
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:49,340
We've got it in the bag.

1000
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:51,580
I send, here to the newcomer
I send you.

1001
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,900
-You do nothing, Don Jesús, not a peep.
But I...

1002
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,940
Quiet, quiet is good.

1003
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,760
Envy because it is hand
and is learning

1004
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:04,020
and I'm going to give him a chance to
not to take away the boy's illusion.

1005
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:09,140
You quiet,
up to me, always up to me.

1006
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:13,700
(CRIES)

1007
01:07:44,820 --> 01:07:47,300
My partner throws out without thinking
seven more.

1008
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:49,180
A 12.

1009
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,420
But why do you throw a girl out?
asshole?

1010
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:52,860
Hey, kid, I'm your boss.

1011
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:55,140
This is what the country of asshole bosses is like.
Like this.

1012
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,140
Asshole, he said asshole.

1013
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:00,300
Forgive me, but today
for private matters,

1014
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:01,660
I am distracted.

1015
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,940
You can sometimes be distracted at work, but not
at work, but not at play.

1016
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,300
My daughter, the oldest, is sick,

1017
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,060
just now, it is being
are operating on it.

1018
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,020
But in those circumstances,
you don't sit down to play,

1019
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:14,820
that mus is a game of partners.

1020
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,620
I have sat down to play the game
because it distracts me.

1021
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:20,700
-Let's go fast,
we'll catch them distracted.

1022
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:23,420
-Everything went very well, Eusebio,
without any complications.

1023
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,460
In a little while
we will take her home.

1024
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,980
My daughter is doing well,
no problems have been reported.

1025
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,700
Problem solved, right?
Let's see if you can concentrate now.

1026
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,140
Rabbit.
What?

1027
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,220
Conejil, don Jesús,
rabbit.

1028
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:39,980
That you throw two.
You'll see, I'm going blind.

1029
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,660
Now, if you carry something,
throw in another bunny.

1030
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:45,460
Because I tell you
with my hand on my heart,

1031
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:46,940
those of Uncle Perete.

1032
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,020
Rabbit.
Órdago.

1033
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:56,020
-I can see it.

1034
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:00,940
-But well.
-What's up, dumb ass?

1035
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:05,700
You dumb ass,
he called him a dumb ass.

1036
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,740
The girl.

1037
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:26,700
-You, sit down, Chus.

1038
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:30,900
Bonita.

1039
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,140
There is a paper written.

1040
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,500

I leave you in the jungle.

1041

I'm going to nowhere,
Anselmo Gato".

1042
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,620
What an outrage.
-Has he committed suicide?

1043
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:48,300
-We'll have to call his parents, they may know something.
they may know something.

1044
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:49,980
You are here.

1045
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,740
Anselmo.
Don't move, Chus.

1046
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,300
If you had told him
to give you back the keys.

1047
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:01,660
-Let me go now.

1048
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:04,740
-This time it was serious.

1049
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:07,100
-Bring a glass of milk,
bring a glass of milk.

1050
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:10,580
better to stick your fingers in your mouth
and make him vomit.

1051
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,940
-Bring milk, damn it.
Chus, don't go in there.

1052
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,100
Open his mouth, Mariano,
open his mouth.

1053
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:19,420
-If he is not breathing.

1054
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:23,300
Milk.

1055
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,260
Anselmo, Anselmo.

1056
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,100
It is alive. Chus, he's alive,
it's like the other times.

1057
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,740
What we have to do now

1058
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:40,540
is to get him out of bed
and get you on your feet.

1059
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:41,900
-Come, Anselmo.

1060
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,820
-It's all very well what Trini says,
but it is impossible.

1061
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:46,980
-Maybe it's better right here.
-On the bed?

1062
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:48,700
-Yes, turn him upside down.
-How?

1063
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:50,580
-Tell it, tell it.

1064
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:54,780
-Didn't you hear me?
I want you to leave me the fuck alone.

1065
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,420
Release me or die.

1066
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,340
-Take the knife away from him.
-I can't open his fist.

1067
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,260
-We'll have to call his parents.

1068
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,780
-I don't think so, don't you remember that the other day he tried the same thing at his house?
the other day he tried the same thing at home?

1069
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,420
-Better to leave it alone until you see a doctor,
a doctor, call a doctor,

1070
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,340
No, that can't be him,
he's a snitch.

Yes, yes, I understood,
Eusebio, love,

1072

but don't be nervous.

I know, I know that you have gone
to your daughter's apartment,

1074

but right now
we send a doctor,

you can't call on the phone,

you have to go.

1078

Point the address.

Villamoral 95, 9, 5.

1080
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:51,900
Yes, call me if there are problems.

Well, now you
you must forgive me.

I have to leave.
Is something wrong with your daughter?

1083

No, it is not that.

That you can't follow the game?

because I was having a blast,

Fuck the family, boss.

It's not like you're a member of the
of good manners.

1093
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,780
To have thought about it before
and not married.

1094

The game is the game.
The rest of us are here, damn it.

Look, Antonio, go to hell.

I found everything changed.

seem different.

But, now, hearing
all those bad words together,

how I found all this.

1143
01:15:03,860 --> 01:15:05,780
I talk to the others,
but you don't ask me anything.

1144
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:07,700
How are you doing here,
my son?

1145
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:11,460
How did you find your land,
your neighborhood, your family?

1146
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:13,340
Everything more changed
than I thought.

1147
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:14,900
They look like others.

1148
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:17,620
You, on the other hand, are the same
as the day you left.

1149
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:20,620
Do you think so, Mom?
I'm much older.

1150
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:24,460
There, sitting in that chair,
I'm not saying no,

1151
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,460
but I see you, here, here.

1152
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:31,860
I went to see the people from Vallecas
and I didn't get along with them,

1153
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:33,380
I did not recognize them.

1154
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:34,940
They are bastards.

1155
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:37,500
I want to stay, mom,
to be near you,

1156
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,220
but it is not easy.

1157
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:42,100
We have one million
and here a million is nothing.

1158
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,380
Also,
I don't do food.

1159
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:47,780
The meat here is good,
but they cut it very badly.

1160
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:51,300
You ate very little meat
when you were little.

1161
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,980
Do you think Mabel, my wife,
the same thing will happen with food?

1162
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,500
But I don't know your wife
only from a picture you sent

1163
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,420
who looked like a marquise
or a mannequin in a shop window.

1164
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:08,060
Here, looking at the photo,
we were laughing for hours and hours.

1166
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:12,540
Screw them.
I'm going to see who it is, Mom.

1167
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:18,740
What a bad comedian he is.

1168
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,740
Hello, good morning.
Is Mr. Eusebio Muñiz in?

1169
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:26,220
No, it is not.

1170
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:30,940
If I am not mistaken, you must be Eusebio's brother, right?
Eusebio's brother, right?

1171
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,060
The exile.
That's right.

1172
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:35,580
I was until recently
nephew of yours.

1173
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:39,700
I am Anselmo Gato,
the ex-husband of Chus, your niece.

1174
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:42,500
Pleased to meet you.
Please come in.

1175
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:45,300
This is Libertad Gato,
her great-niece.

1176
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:47,300
Nice to meet you too.

1177
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:49,980
She's very pretty, huh?
Excuse me, I'm going to sit down.

1178
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:52,420
It doesn't look like it, but it's heavy.

1179
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,420
I have come to leave it here.

1180
01:16:57,360 --> 01:16:59,580
Can you give me a chinchón?
Certainly.

1181
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:07,060
I thought I would find Eusebio here.
He left for the restaurant.

1182
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:12,220
I've been delayed,
because of the child, you know?

1183
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:15,380
I have to change him,
warm up his bottle.

1184
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:19,100
My intention was to
to leave the child to Eusebio

1185
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:23,820
for him to give it to Chus.
I don't want to see Chus.

1186
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:28,780
Not out of resentment, but because
I am not very well on my nerves

1187
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:31,900
and I don't like
strong emotions.

1188
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,660
When we split up,
the fiercest fight we had

1189
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:40,180
was because we both
wanted to keep the child.

1190
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,420
(CRIES)

1191
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:45,580
-But I said I cannot.

1192
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,860
I'm a cartoonist, you know?
I know, I know.

1193
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,740
And since I kept the child,
I haven't picked up a pencil again.

1194
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,900
And Anselmo Gato
has to keep drawing,

1195
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:01,220
has to live.

1196
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,180
Precisely,
now I have just been commissioned

1197
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:06,180
the covers
of a collection of classics.

1198
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:11,260
I, for the moment, am going to sleep
in the apartment of some friends,

1199
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:13,260
because my parents
have kicked us out of the house.

1200
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:15,140
Why?

1201
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:21,140
To me because of my ideas and to Libertad
because she is not baptized.

1202
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,980
Baptize her.
No, I don't want to.

1203
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:27,620
And neither does your mother.
But you are not a believer.

1204
01:18:28,140 --> 01:18:29,940
No, I am agnostic.

1205
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:32,620
Well then, what does it matter to her
she cares if she is baptized.

1206
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:35,020
You defend your ideas
in one way,

1207
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:38,180
I defend them from another,
from the one I can.

1208
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:40,820
I understand.

1209
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:46,060
And maybe one of these days
I'll go to Paris,

1210
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:47,740
which is where we have to be now.

1211
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:50,660
What about the covers
you've just been commissioned?

1212
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:52,940
I don't know, I don't know.

1213
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:56,420
If it weren't for the child
and my mother,

1214
01:18:56,940 --> 01:19:00,140
who is very sick at heart,
I would have left by now.

1215
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:04,140
If not, I'm going to do something crazy.

1216
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:10,860
I want to ask you a favor. Do you have
something to do this morning?

1217
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:15,140
She told me to bring her.
My daughter, Libe, my pretty one.

1218
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:18,180
Oh, but how thin she has become.

1219
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:19,980
-Don't say, Chus,
it's the same as before.

1220
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,020
-Well, then
I should have put on weight.

1221
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:23,740
Look at the way she has her clothes on.

1222
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:25,940
If your father has always
has always been a handyman.

1223
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:29,660
Angelito, but she's soaking wet.
Her whole ass is wet.

1224
01:19:30,180 --> 01:19:31,740
Same as the elevator.

1225
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:35,340
Dude, since you're here,
I'll take this opportunity to say goodbye.

1226
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:37,860
Maybe this afternoon
we don't have time to meet,

1227
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:39,660
I leave at five o'clock.
And where are you going?

1228
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:42,540
Look, this is Lucas,
my partner.

1229
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:44,700
Hello, how are you?
Good, and you?

1230
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:47,300
We are leaving this afternoon.
Yes, but where are you going?

1231
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:48,980
To Paris,
with the students.

1232
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,700
I guess you'll like it
that we're going there.

1233
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:53,980
You already did your thing
years ago.

1234
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,740
Now, it's our turn.

1235
01:19:56,260 --> 01:19:57,940
Aren't you too young
to be involved in this?

1236
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,420
Come on, man.
It's dangerous.

1237
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:00,860
Well, we already know,
we already know.

1238
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,180
Do you want me to say something
to your old man, to your dad?

1239
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,300
Because I don't know what he's going to say
when he finds out.

1240
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:07,820
You know, I'm not a girl
who runs away, man.

1241
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,660
He signed the papers
just in case.

1242
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:11,700
I understand.

1243
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:14,780
Anyone would say that the one who doesn't like
this trip is you,

1244
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:17,500
to the unbeliever, to the exile.
Let it go.

1245
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:19,900
I thought I was giving him a treat.

1246
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,660
You wouldn't want to take
the idea out of your head, would you?

1247
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,340
Mer, it's for you, Mer.

1248
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,340
Yes?
Hello, Mer.

1250
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,220
I've been here since early in the morning
here in the cafeteria,

1251
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:35,660
to see you leave.

1252
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,820
I went upstairs and knocked,
but no one opened the door.

1253
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,660
It would just be my grandmother.

1254
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:43,220
I've been all the time looking out
and I haven't seen you.

1255

I have not slept at home, Basilio.

1256
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:48,580
Don't tell me, don't tell me,
in the pub I found out everything.

1257
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:51,380
I know you're dating Lucas
and I have been told that you are leaving.

1258
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,740
Don't talk to me about these things,
Basilio, please.

1259
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:56,940
Tell me it's not true, Mer.
Yes it is true, I'm not going to lie to you.

1260
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:02,380
Does that mean goodbye forever?
Yes, Basilio, it means goodbye.

1261
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:06,380
Goodbye forever?
Yes, forever.

I'm taking a walk.

1304
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,700
This street?
Yes, I like to walk here.

1305
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:16,660
Please leave me alone.

1306
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:20,340
Listen to me, Basilio,
I am much older than you.

1307
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:23,420
You are a man,
but next to me you are a kid.

1308
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:25,820
Leave me alone.
Hear what I say to you.

1309
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:28,500
It is convenient for you to walk
anywhere,

1310
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:31,860
but not on this street.
Leave me alone! Mind your own business!

1311
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:34,060
Listen, Basilio.
I want to be calm.

1312
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:35,380
It's okay.

1313
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,540
It's good to see you.
I'm glad you're leaving me!

1314
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:39,980
(Music)

1315
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,660
Waiter.

1316
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:06,380
Can I have a coffee, please,
and a glass of Founder's? Girl.

1317
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:09,580
-How?
-Half a glass, no more, I mean.

1318
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:11,900
And the bill.
-Very good, sir.

1319
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:16,580
Another gaucho.

1320
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:26,700
Excuse me, Argentinean.
You can tell.

1321
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:29,220
You too.
More or less, Spanish.

1322
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:31,940
But I've lived there for 30 years.
Please sit down.

1323
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:33,540
Thank you.
A drink?

1324
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:34,900
No, no, thank you.

1325
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:37,220
Antonio, bring me the coffee
to this table, will you?

1326
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:41,180
Have you been in Spain for long?
No, just four days.

1327
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,460
I'm passing through, I'm going to Paris.

1328
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:48,980
So what's new over there?
I talk on the phone with my wife.

1329
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,260
What can they tell you?
That they are all fine,

1330
01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:53,260
that the market is getting
more expensive every day.

1331
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,980
Excuse me, but...
You who have been here the longest.

1332
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:57,900
For a tip,
is 20 pesetas okay?

1333
01:25:58,420 --> 01:25:59,900
To spare,
this is a luxury place.

1334
01:26:00,420 --> 01:26:02,660
Excuse me,
what were you telling me over there?

1335
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:04,300
What can I tell you.

1336
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:08,260
Lavalle, corriente, florida,
is in the same place.

1337
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:10,380
Current, flowery.

1338
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,060
Now, if you want to know
something specific,

1339
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:16,700
soccer, you are looking for...
Not soccer.

1340
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:21,260
What happens is that Argentine newspapers
Argentine newspapers are very late.

1341
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:22,980
Last week
I went to the Consulate

1342
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,700
and I spent the whole morning
I read "Clarín", "La Nación".

1343
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:29,660
Don Jesús, Don Jesús.
-They call him.

1344
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,500
And tell me, are you alone here,
in Madrid?

1345
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:34,700
Yes, I travel alone, I am a widower.

1346
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:37,700
Now that the kids
are grown up, I take advantage of it.

1347
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,460
Listen, what do you say
if tomorrow night we get together

1348
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:44,180
and we're going to eat at a place
called Rancho Criollo?

1349
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,180
Here, in Madrid?
Yes, yes, here, in Madrid.

1350
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:49,260
We eat a nice barbecue,
listen to some good tangos.

1351
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:51,500
Don't tell me
you like tangos.

1352
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:56,500
Not so much there,
but here they are heard in a different way.

1353
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:59,260
(Music)

1354
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:22,860
(Braking)

1355
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:34,660
Chocolates, how sweet. Would you like one?
Well, thank you very much.

1356
01:27:35,180 --> 01:27:37,460
And you, Chus?
-No, not me, thanks, mom.

1357
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:38,860
-I am going to try one.

1358
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:43,540
It's been ages since I've seen you
and you haven't brought her to me.

1359
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:45,700
He must be about to get married by now.

1360
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:48,700
And your sister, Mer?
She's dead, isn't she?

1361
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:51,820
-Oh, Mom, you know
that this month she has her exams.

1362
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:55,260
Well, I have to go now.
-Yes, doctor's visit, right?

1363
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:59,340
-Work, mom, see you soon.
-See you when you can, daughter.

1364
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:01,020
See you later.
Bye.

1365
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,420
Have you seen what a pack of lies?
Why do you say that?

1366
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:08,060
You know it like I do.

1367
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:10,940
They won't bring her to me,
because Chus doesn't have her.

1368
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:14,220
His father has it.
No, not anymore.

1369
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,700
It will be a few days ago.
Yes.

1370
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:20,620
And Chus is no longer living with Anselmo,
he is living with someone else.

1371
01:28:21,300 --> 01:28:24,860
The other one, the little one,
is not coming because she has exams.

1372
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:26,660
If they have closed the faculties.

1373
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:32,900
What is happening is that he has gone to Paris
with a friend to make the revolution.

1374
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:34,980
Unfortunate.

1375
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,340
Would you like a drink?
No, thank you very much.

1376
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,340
I am going to have a drink.

1377
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:50,780
Are you a teetotaler?
No, but it's not my time yet.

1378
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:52,940
Already.

1379
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:57,900
You were very controlling,
you were quite cold.

1380
01:28:58,760 --> 01:28:59,980
Do you think so?

1381
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,620
This is how I remember you,
but anyone knows.

1382
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:04,420
Memory is very deceiving.

1383
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:08,060
I remember you always cheerful
and so beautiful.

1384
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:11,660
I remember you playing diabolo,
jumping rope.

1385
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:14,340
But that was kid stuff.

1386
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,620
When you grew up,
you became even prettier.

1387
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:20,620
Memories.

1388
01:29:21,140 --> 01:29:23,100
Do you remember that
you used to sing at the skipping rope

1389
01:29:23,620 --> 01:29:24,820
that was so fashionable?

1390
01:29:25,340 --> 01:29:27,580
It's been on my mind
all these years,

1391
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:30,060
but I could never remember
neither the lyrics nor the melody.

1392
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:32,580
It is called "La canastera".

1393
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:38,100
I am the canastera de capuchinos.

1394
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:41,740
Gladden the songs
my land.

1395
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:45,660
I'm watching you,
I'm watching you jump rope.

1396
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:48,780
And there was another one,
another very sad one, of war.

1397
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,700
I, who was a kid, was shocked that the girl, in order to play
that the girl, in order to play,

1398
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,620
sing such a sad song.

1399
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:57,220
In the mud ravine,

1400
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:01,060
there is a fountain that emanates

1401
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,460
blood of the Spaniards

1402
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:08,900
who died for their country.

1403
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:10,860
That one, that one.

1404
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:15,460
Oh, Jesus, you stayed there.
No, don't believe it.

1405
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:18,780
What happens when I see you again
and finding me here.

1406
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:23,300
This is our dining room, right?
My parents' dining room.

1407
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:25,340
Yes.

1408
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:28,540
When Eusebio and I got married,

1409
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:32,060
we bought the four pieces of junk
he had with the ones I had.

1410
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:37,020
Then, when we parted, he
he was very gentle, very gentlemanly.

1411
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:40,540
He gave me the old furniture
and he bought new ones.

1412
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:43,980
I spent entire afternoons here.

1413
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:48,540
In winter, when I couldn't go out
to play in the street...

1414
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:55,220
In that drawer were kept the checkerboard and
checkerboard and Parcheesi.

1415
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:59,140
Now there are only old rags
and a deck of cards.

1416
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:02,180
Sometimes I make solitaires.

1417
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:11,140
You shouldn't drink so much, Marcela.

1418
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:13,980
Eusebio must have already told you
that I'm a drunk.

1419
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:17,180
We don't talk about it.
Ask him who is to blame.

1420
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:21,340
You loved each other very much.
That was before.

1421
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:26,500
You were crazy about Eusebio,
you only had eyes for him.

1422
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:30,140
I used to look at you less, didn't I?
No, I'm not saying that.

1423
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:35,180
But yes, you're right,
to me and to everyone.

1424
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:37,380
You were our mailman.

1425
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:41,180
You don't look the mailman in the face,
you look at the envelope.

1426
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,420
(TOSE)

1427
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:50,180
You used to bring us cards and bring us letters.

1428
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:53,540
You lied to cover for us
when we came home late.

1429
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:55,260
He asked me to.

1430
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:57,980
I was the older brother,
but he was the leader of the gang.

1431
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,700
(LAUGHTER) The boss.

1432
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:03,860
That was in the good old days,
when Eusebio was another man.

1433
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:06,060
The same as in politics.

1434
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:08,260
We were
against the policy.

1435
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:12,860
Tell it any way you want,
but Eusebio was another man.

1436
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:19,620
He had passion, enthusiasm.
I wanted to do things, to change the world.

1437
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:23,180
He wanted me,

1438
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,620
but after the war

1439
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,580
became
into the wreck that it is now.

1440
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:31,140
I have found him
as intelligent as ever.

1441
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:33,340
Tolerant,
understanding of others.

1442
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:34,820
Tolerant?

1443
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:37,260
(LAUGHTER)

1444
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:46,180
No, Marcela.
Get the fuck off!

1445
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,740
What happens is
that now he doesn't care about anything.

1446
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:00,620
That his mother is backpacking...

1447
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:02,460
He doesn't care.
Don't say that.

1448
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:05,340
It seems to me that...
That a woman crosses his path

1449
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:07,900
that endangers the couple,
he... for her.

1450
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:10,220
That his wife cheats on him?
He doesn't care.

1451
01:33:10,740 --> 01:33:14,060
That his mistress is a procurer,
whore, smuggler, usurer...

1452
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:15,820
He doesn't care.

1453
01:33:16,340 --> 01:33:18,460
(Music)

1454
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,340
(SIGHS)

1455
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:23,700
Look, Jesus...

1456
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:26,740
Look at the difference
there is between these times

1457
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,380
and good times.

1458
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:30,460
When Eusebio,

1459
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,420
my Eusebio was another man.

1460
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:37,020
And then there's crazy Mer,

1461
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:39,940
the little one.

1462
01:33:40,460 --> 01:33:43,020
(CRYING) There, in Paris...

1463
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,860
Have you read the newspapers?

1464
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:48,740
Yes, I read something.

1465
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:52,300
Locked in,
mixed up with each other.

1466
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:54,500
And among them, Mer,

1467
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:56,660
the little one.

1468
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:58,820
My daughter...

1469
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:01,580
Eusebio's daughter.

1470
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:05,660
Fucking down the stairs,
down the hallways...

1471
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:09,420
That is the revolution.

1472
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:11,540
I don't know what to tell you, Marcela.

1473
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:13,900
That is where Eusebio
has sent my daughter.

1474
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:17,340
That's what your father wanted
and you two.

1475
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:19,620
That's what that man would have done
that man would have done,

1476
01:34:20,140 --> 01:34:23,220
the man who was Eusebio
in the good old days.

1477
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:26,660
Is that tolerance?

1478
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:29,860
What about the other?

1479
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,540
What is it?
Don't sneak away, Jesus.

1480
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:35,460
You have said that Eusebio's waste,
Eusebio's dead...,

1481
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:38,380
because he is dead,
was what?

1482
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:41,140
I think I said that I was
sympathetic to everyone.

1483
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:45,020
(LAUGHTER) But with what world?

1484
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:47,380
But he is alone!
He doesn't see anyone!

1485
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:50,020
Nor to those who are close to him,
those who work with him.

1486
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:52,460
Your brother,
the one from now, not the one from before

1487
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:55,020
of how I jumped the skipping rope
and sings the...

1488
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:56,580
The what?

1489
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:58,100
I don't know.

1490
01:34:58,620 --> 01:34:59,940
"La canastera".
That.

1491
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,620
The Eusebio of today sees no one.

1492
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:05,220
He gets up,
shaves in front of the mirror...

1493
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:07,180
You see him.

1494
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:08,980
There, in the mirror.

1495
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:12,700
And it is as if the mirror in front
the mirror in front of it.

1496
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:16,660
Go away, Jesus.

1497
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:18,660
How?

1498
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:20,180
That you leave.

1499
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:22,660
But why?

1500
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:26,460
Because from now on,
you can no longer be with me.

1501
01:35:26,980 --> 01:35:28,180
I can, Marcela.

1502
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:32,340
Only Doña Ambrosia, the neighbor.
But Marcela...

1503
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:34,260
Go away at once!

1504
01:35:34,780 --> 01:35:37,380
(Nostalgic music)

1505
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,580
Good boy.

1506
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:44,420
Obedient, as always.

1507
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:48,580
Give lots of kisses to the girls
and grandma,

1508
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:52,100
that I love her very much.
You tell her.

1509
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:57,140
Here, I give you kisses for everyone,

1510
01:35:57,660 --> 01:36:00,060
the kisses I didn't give you then.

1511
01:36:00,580 --> 01:36:02,740
Marcela!

1512
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:04,740
(SIGHS)

1513
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:13,460
Yes, I came with illusions,
but here the haute couture

1514
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:15,420
is in crisis.
I was well informed.

1515
01:36:15,940 --> 01:36:18,100
As for me,
I wouldn't know what to do.

1516
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:22,260
Investing is a dream.
What we have are caspas,

1517
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:25,500
Ah, are you happy?

1518
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:29,900
(LAUGHS) If you are happy,
I'm happy too.

1519
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:33,740
Why didn't you tell me
that you were afraid to come?

1520
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:37,980
You were also afraid to
to tell me the other thing. That's silly, Mabel.

1521
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:42,060
And I miss, I miss a lot.
I don't like it,

1522
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:44,380
but it's not what I left.

1523
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:47,260
In addition, I felt like working again.
I felt like working again.

1524
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:50,060
Yes, I know it's weird.
You're right, but they came back to me.

1525
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:53,860
I'm not cold here anymore.
Mer! Mer!

1526
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:57,420
Come into my arms, Mer!
What do you say, mother?

1527
01:36:57,940 --> 01:37:00,740
Has Mer arrived?
Where has that tramp been hiding?

1528
01:37:01,260 --> 01:37:04,260
What do you want to play?
You know Mer is not here.

1529
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:06,740
She has gone to Alicante
with some friends.

1530
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:09,780
Yes, to Alicante...
To take sea baths!

1531
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:11,660
Mer, I find you.

1532
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:14,220
I find you
and I give you a spanking.

1533
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:18,340
That I heard your voice from the bed,
that I heard your voice...

1534
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,140
Mer!
No, no, mother, mother...

1535
01:37:22,660 --> 01:37:24,020
Mer has not come.
What has arrived is

1536
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:27,460
a telegram from her.
Then read it to me.

1537
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:31,420
(LEE) "I arrive tomorrow, four late.
Stop. Approximately,

1538
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:36,260
because I travel on the road. Stop.
Hugs to all. Mer".

1539
01:37:36,780 --> 01:37:39,660
I knew it, I knew it.
Why did you know?

1540
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:45,140
Fuck! Because I heard it on the radio.
The day before yesterday they said, finally,

1541
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:49,340
that verbena they had set up in Paris
they had set up in Paris.

1542
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:51,980
We have been on the verge of achieving it.

1543
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,380
But it is more difficult
than I thought it would be.

1544
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:58,140
I don't know, maybe in another century...
Maybe it will be enough for you.

1545
01:37:58,660 --> 01:38:01,620
And the first days
it seemed so fucking easy...

1546
01:38:02,140 --> 01:38:04,420
(SIGHS) The youth
of the whole world was with us

1547
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:06,460
or, at least, we believed it.

1548
01:38:06,980 --> 01:38:08,540
But the smartest students
smartest

1549
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:10,820
thought Marcuse was right.

1550
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:13,220
The workers are no longer
are no longer for the revolution.

1551
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:16,640
It is that they have left in it
too much blood.

1552
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:18,740
They prefer to submit to the bourgeoisie

1553
01:38:19,220 --> 01:38:21,260
as long as they are increased, little by little
little by little,

1554
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,700
The Communist Party,
in the end, took flight.

1555
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:26,540
Russia is not in favor of
for the revolution,

1556
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:28,940
We all knew that.
And of course, it's an empire,

1557
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:32,260
like the other.
More or less rich, but like the other.

1558
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:33,780
That, of course.

1559
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:37,260
But what are we going to fool ourselves for?
The truth is that it's all over

1560
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:40,100
when De Gaulle
returned to Paris and made the speech.

1561
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:42,500
The entire right wing
took to the streets.

1562
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:46,740
It was frightening to see them... approaching
from the windows of the Odeon.

1563
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:50,180
Our ringleaders
started to leave.

1564
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:56,180
Then, the police entered the Odeon,
the Beaux-Arts, the Sorbonne...

1565
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:59,900
They were forcibly evicted....
But they had promised

1566
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:02,500
that those who went out calmly
nothing would happen to them, right?

1567
01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:04,020
Yes, yes, but...

1568
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:06,980
When we came out,
were the police vans, the police vans

1569
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:09,340
and there they were putting
students.

1570
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:12,100
Some escaped,

1571
01:39:12,620 --> 01:39:15,460
I was lucky and I was one of those.

1572
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:19,860
Don Quixote returns home.

1573
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:21,980
(Clock)

1574
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:23,580
And Trini and Pepe?

1575
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:26,060
Trini
is only a few days away.

1576
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:29,780
Please, Mer,
you haven't been gone that long.

1577
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:32,180
He still has two months to go.

1578
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:35,900
And Anselmo? Is he well?

1579
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:39,500
Have you seen him again?
No! We have not seen him again.

1580
01:39:40,020 --> 01:39:41,740
But it's good, very good.
We know.

1581
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:43,940
He was about to leave
to Paris, like you!

1582
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:46,980
But, in the end, he didn't leave;
because, as his mother is ill

1583
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:48,940
of the heart...
And for the covers!

1584
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:51,700
Yes, that's why too!

1585
01:39:52,940 --> 01:39:55,420
And Basilio's heavy?

1586
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,740
Have you heard from him?

1587
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:02,740
Basil...

1588
01:40:03,260 --> 01:40:04,180
(Sad music)

1589
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:07,660
What?
Has something happened to you again?

1590
01:40:08,180 --> 01:40:11,060
Basilio has committed suicide.

1591
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,940
No...

1592
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:25,580
Do you mind if I come in to see you, Mom?
On the contrary, I appreciate it.

1593
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:29,940
Sit down. But first,
please draw the curtain.

1594
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:34,060
The good weather is here
and there is too much light.

1595
01:40:34,580 --> 01:40:37,740
For chatting it is better in the twilight.

1596
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:42,300
Well, you tell me.
I'm leaving very soon.

1597
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:46,140
And I wouldn't want to leave
without talking some more.

1598
01:40:46,660 --> 01:40:49,380
Because if there...
things are still going well for me,

1599
01:40:49,900 --> 01:40:52,620
I may not come back.
And when are you leaving?

1600
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:54,620
Tomorrow.

1601
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:56,660
The plane leaves
at two o'clock in the morning.

1602
01:40:57,180 --> 01:41:01,260
But first we will all meet
here, at home, for dinner.

1603
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,020
My son told me.

1604
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:05,540
I think it's going to be
a dinner in style.

1605
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:09,140
My son does that very well.
It's his trade.

1606
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:12,740
He, the girls and Lupe have spent hours discussing the menu.
hours discussing the menu.

1607
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:17,380
When I saw you the first time,
I thought you looked like an asshole.

1608
01:41:17,940 --> 01:41:20,780
But I have changed my mind.
Have you?

1609
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:24,100
You are very smart.
Do you know why?

1610
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:26,940
That's why he has made
the blanket over his head

1611
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:30,540
and say: "I'm leaving".
Do you think so?

1612
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:32,740
You have
have nothing to do...

1613
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:37,580
Well, what a store of clowns
of clowns and phonies is this one.

1614
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,900
That's not why I'm leaving, Mom.

1615
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:44,860
I am leaving because
this Spain is not the one I knew.

1616
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:47,900
Neither Madrid is Madrid anymore.
Here, of course.

1617
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:50,980
Nor are you you.
What I want to say is that...

1618
01:41:51,500 --> 01:41:54,020
I didn't mean to upset you, did I?
God forbid.

1619
01:41:54,540 --> 01:41:56,860
I know,
because I heard it on the radio,

1620
01:41:57,380 --> 01:42:00,020
that Argentine comedians are very good
are very good.

1621
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:02,900
That has nothing to do with...
Shut up!

1622
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:06,380
Argentinean comedians
will be very good, I don't dispute that;

1623
01:42:06,900 --> 01:42:10,820
but you, to tell you the truth,
as an actor you're pretty weak.

1624
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:13,780
I'm not an actor, Mom.
I was wondering...

1625
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:16,620
But this guy,
who works so badly,

1626
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:19,940
how can you imitate so well
the Argentine accent so well?

1627
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:23,260
But I got him.
You are Argentine!

1628
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:24,620
Isn't it?

1629
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:28,220
Aren't you Argentinean?
Yes, Mom, yes.

1630
01:42:28,740 --> 01:42:31,620
Don't call me mom, milk!
Yes, ma'am.

1631
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:34,180
You see?
You are Argentinean.

1632
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:36,660
From La Pampa...

1633
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:40,900
You are right to go back there,
on the other side of the sea.

1634
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:44,620
Or are you afraid
for political reasons?

1635
01:42:45,140 --> 01:42:47,380
Are you a persecuted person?
No, I am not.

1636
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:51,180
Listen to me, I'm talking to you
as your mother would speak to you.

1637
01:42:51,700 --> 01:42:54,060
To the politicians
to hell with them!

1638
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:58,580
Whatever color they are.
And if you have to change jackets,

1639
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:02,220
Don't they just backflip when it's
when they feel like it?

1640
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:04,860
Well then...

1641
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:08,620
Do not do as my husband did,
my poor Jesus, may he be in glory.

1642
01:43:09,140 --> 01:43:11,420
Who lost half his life
with what if the idea,

1643
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:13,420
with what if the cast...

1644
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:16,780
Or like my Jesusín,
my son, the eldest,

1645
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:20,900
that he had to hide in the sea
and it did him no good.

1646
01:43:21,420 --> 01:43:24,780
(SOBS) He drowned,
drowned forever...

1647
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:28,220
You have to live, my friend.
That's the only important thing.

1648
01:43:28,740 --> 01:43:30,140
Do you agree?

1649
01:43:30,660 --> 01:43:32,900
Yes, yes, ma'am.
Here, in your office,

1650
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:37,780
with that tango accent, he was going to have a hard time
it was going to be hard to find a job.

1651
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:42,940
I would only find scrounging botches,
like this one right now.

1652
01:43:43,460 --> 01:43:48,020
Believe me, an old woman is telling you.
Where the work is,

1653
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:51,380
there is one's land.

1654
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:54,580
Unless you are a millionaire,
of course,

1655
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,580
that is already international.

1656
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:00,620
(LAUGHTER)

1657
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,260
(Door)

1658
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:13,980
No, Florida is a pedestrian street.
Oh, is it?

1659
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:16,580
The movie theaters are in Lavalle, you know?
Lupe much insisting

1660
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:19,100
that we would not be delayed
and it is she who does not arrive.

1661
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:22,580
Ah, there it is.
I thought Florida was like Gran Via.

1662
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:24,420
Sure, that's it, that's it.

1663
01:44:24,940 --> 01:44:27,260
These are the candles.

1664
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:30,980
For you, Jesus,
memories of old Spain.

1665
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:33,460
Thank you, Lupe,
why did you bother?

1666
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,060
No, don't open those.
They are for Mabel and the boy.

1667
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:39,020
They will be happy to open them.
Ah...

1668
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:42,460
Nothing original. Mantilla of lace
and silver Toledo dagger.

1669
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:45,820
This is yours.
Hey! But what's so big?

1670
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:48,980
It looks like a painting, doesn't it?

1671
01:44:57,400 --> 01:45:00,460
How much I appreciate it...

1672
01:45:00,980 --> 01:45:02,020
But what does it say here?

1673
01:45:02,540 --> 01:45:05,820
(LEE) "Antonio Bienvenida,
Curro Romero and Jesús Muñiz,

1674
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:07,940
that will confirm the alternative".

1675
01:45:08,460 --> 01:45:09,740
(LAUGHTER) How much I thank you...

1676
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:13,940
Don't pretend there is trust.
It's clear that you don't appreciate it at all.

1677
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:17,180
I thank you for the detail,
the intention, the memory...

1678
01:45:17,700 --> 01:45:19,260
But, to me,
I never liked bullfighting.

1679
01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:22,300
Neither me nor my brother.
It seemed like a wild party,

1680
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:23,820
backward...
So...

1681
01:45:24,340 --> 01:45:26,460
Are you an Argentinean
who doesn't like tangos

1682
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:28,780
and a Spaniard
who does not like bullfighting?

1683
01:45:29,300 --> 01:45:32,460
Don't worry. Just in case,
I made sure the frame was good.

1684
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:36,660
In Buenos Aires, you show the poster
to the compadritos and the family.

1685
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:39,140
Then, you take it off...
and put a mirror.

1686
01:45:39,660 --> 01:45:42,500
I don't like bullfighting, but I don't like
I don't like to look at myself in the mirror.

1687
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:45,020
Son, how difficult you are...

1688
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:47,420
(LAUGHTER)

1689
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:49,820
Permission.

1690
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:55,740
The candles are up!

1691
01:45:56,260 --> 01:45:58,420
Please,
Who has a lighter?

1692
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:00,860
Thank you very much,
I'll take them both.

1693
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:03,540
Chus, everything is ready!

1694
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:08,060
Lucas, draw the curtains, please.
Mariano, turn off the lights.

1695
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:09,980
You know where they are.

1696
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:12,660
The floor lamp is left alone.

1697
01:46:13,180 --> 01:46:15,180
(Campanadas)

1698
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:31,980
But how beautiful you look, Grandma.

1699
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:36,340
For once I leave the house,
I'm not going to be a wreck.

1700
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:40,180
And these flowers? How beautiful...
This gentleman gave them to me,

1701
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:44,380
who is a foreigner.
This is your place, Mrs. Eusebia.

1702
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:47,300
Jesus, there.
Mer, you there and there.

1703
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:49,620
Yeah, I know.
Chus, that's your place.

1704
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:52,900
And Mariano, here, with me.

1705
01:46:55,600 --> 01:46:58,100
Well, call the maître d'.
Papa!

1706
01:46:58,620 --> 01:47:01,620
No, Chus...
Don't fuck it all up!

1707
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:07,500
Not like this... Clap your hands.
Come on, clap your hands.

1708
01:47:08,020 --> 01:47:09,340
(Clapping)

1709
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:13,260
The menu, please.

1710
01:47:13,780 --> 01:47:15,220
Oh...

1711
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:18,780
But, my son,
this letter like this, in the half light...

1712
01:47:19,300 --> 01:47:22,820
I don't see it.
Do you want to tell me...?

1713
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:25,700
Yes, ma'am.
Today we have Duke of Berry salmon,

1714
01:47:26,220 --> 01:47:29,020
filet mignon a la Curnonsky
and strawberries a la Triple Alliance.

1715
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:32,300
Ah, very good, very good...
Thank you, madam.

1716
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:38,020
Lucas, bring the bread and the bottle closer.
How elegant Eusebio is, isn't he?

1717
01:47:38,540 --> 01:47:42,660
I think that on such an important night
we could tell the "maître d'"

1718
01:47:43,180 --> 01:47:46,540
to stay and eat with us.
Please, Eusebio,

1719
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:49,500
we would like you to sit
sit down to dinner with us.

1720
01:47:50,020 --> 01:47:51,700
Here's a place for you.
Thank you, madam.

1721
01:47:52,220 --> 01:47:54,220
For me, it is an honor.

1722
01:47:55,600 --> 01:48:00,500
What's wrong with you, Mer?
Nothing, nothing.

1723
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:04,180
Tremendous oversight!
Forgetfulness! What a failure!

1724
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:05,900
What's up, Lupe?

1725
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:10,300
The music!
We forgot the music, Mer.

1726
01:48:10,820 --> 01:48:15,980
My beloved Buenos Aires....,

1727
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:21,460
when I see you again,

1728
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:28,780
there will be no more sorrow or oblivion.

1729
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:37,340
The streetlight
of the street where I was born

1730
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:41,260
was sentinel
of my promises of love.

1731
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:45,100
Under its quiet little light,
I saw her...

1732
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:46,580
Pass me the salt shaker, Mer.

1733
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:48,860
...to my luminous beetle
like a sun.

1734
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:50,460
(murmur)

1735
01:48:50,980 --> 01:48:53,220
Today that luck
wants me to see you again,

1736
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:57,580
porteño city of my only desire.

1737
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:00,900
I hear a bandoneon's complaint

1738
01:49:01,420 --> 01:49:05,260
inside my chest
my heart asks for a rein.

1739
01:49:05,780 --> 01:49:09,180
My Buenos Aires,
flowery land,

1740
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:13,300
where my life will end.

1741
01:49:13,820 --> 01:49:17,220
Under your protection,
today there is no disappointment.

1742
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:21,580
The years fly by,
the pain is forgotten...

1743
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:23,300
(Waves)

1744
01:49:23,820 --> 01:49:28,100
(Music credits)
