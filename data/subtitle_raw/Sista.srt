1
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:47,016
How are you?

2
00:00:48,976 --> 00:00:50,376
Are you okay?

3
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:53,736
So I… I took the test.

4
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:10,256
- Good morning.
- Morning!

5
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:11,536
Yes?

6
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,696
- Er, madam is expecting me.
- Really? What is your name?

7
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:16,216
Sista.

8
00:01:16,456 --> 00:01:19,256
- Sista what?
- Just say "Sista," the cleaner.

9
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:20,616
Okay.

10
00:01:24,016 --> 00:01:25,496
- Morning.
- Welcome, ma'am.

11
00:01:25,576 --> 00:01:26,816
My madam is not around.

12
00:01:26,856 --> 00:01:28,616
But she said I should
give you the house key.

13
00:01:29,696 --> 00:01:32,256
- What did she say?
- She said I should give you the key.

14
00:01:33,016 --> 00:01:34,946
So am I supposed to just go in to clean

15
00:01:34,986 --> 00:01:36,586
and nobody will be there to watch me?

16
00:01:36,616 --> 00:01:38,442
She said you should call her
when you get here.

17
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,592
So maybe she will tell you
what to do when you call her.

18
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:43,536
- Really?
- Yes ma'am.

19
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:51,936
Hello, ma.

20
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:54,776
- Ah Sista, you are in my house?
- Yes.

21
00:01:55,096 --> 00:01:56,946
Then uh.. they say you say that

22
00:01:56,976 --> 00:01:59,546
I should just enter
the house like that and start cleaning.

23
00:01:59,616 --> 00:02:02,776
That nobody will watch me.
I say, "Ah, no."

24
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:07,376
Dabike and Mrs. Fisher
spoke glowingly about you

25
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:09,816
so I absolutely trust you.

26
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:12,816
Madam, no.

27
00:02:13,456 --> 00:02:14,856
What of inventorying?

28
00:02:15,216 --> 00:02:17,152
You know I'm not used
to just going to people's houses, clean,

29
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:21,236
then when I leave they tell me,
"Oh, something is now missing."

30
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:22,736
You know I don't do it.

31
00:02:22,816 --> 00:02:25,336
Even at that, I will never accuse you.

32
00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:29,936
Ma, is there camera?

33
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:35,336
- Why? Why do you ask?
- So that something is seeing me.

34
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:40,296
Sista, don't worry. There is nothing
to even steal in the house.

35
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:44,376
Just go in and do what you have to do.

36
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:47,856
Okay, ma. Will you come
back before I will finish?

37
00:02:49,056 --> 00:02:51,946
- Yes. I will. I will be back.
- Good.

38
00:02:52,016 --> 00:02:55,066
Just tell my security to give you
the key, and make sure you eat something.

39
00:02:55,096 --> 00:02:58,016
- There's food in the fridge.
- Okay, ma.

40
00:02:58,496 --> 00:02:59,936
Okay.

41
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:03,616
- She say you should give me the key.
- Okay.

42
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:07,656
So what are you going to do about it?

43
00:03:07,816 --> 00:03:10,456
- Me?
- Yes, you.

44
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:15,176
Your WAEC is in a few weeks
and I'm leaving for school next week.

45
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:21,056
My sister… she knows.

46
00:03:24,256 --> 00:03:27,056
She said she's coming to see
your mum at the shop tomorrow.

47
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:28,376
Ah!

48
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:31,376
I don't know what to do.

49
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,096
- Yeah, who's that?
- Open, open, open!

50
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:44,276
Erm, please tell Nonso
to go to the vulcanizer

51
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:45,792
- at the junction and pick up my car.
- Yes, ma.

52
00:03:45,816 --> 00:03:47,636
- You're still here?
- Yes. Welcome, ma.

53
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,226
- Why? You didn't get my alert?
- I got the alert, ma.

54
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:51,556
I'm inventorying.

55
00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:53,392
Sista, you need to leave all that, please.

56
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:54,536
I'm really pressed.

57
00:03:54,616 --> 00:03:56,082
- I need to use the restroom.
- I will wait, ma.

58
00:03:56,106 --> 00:03:59,346
- You can go.
- I will wait, ma. I will wait.

59
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:01,266
Inventorying, inventorying, inventorying.

60
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:03,256
I will wait. I'll wait.

61
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:12,016
- How was lesson?
- It was fine, ma.

62
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:14,616
Yes. Right.

63
00:04:14,736 --> 00:04:17,176
- Mummy, guess what happened today?
- What happened?

64
00:04:18,136 --> 00:04:21,656
Hmm. Risi's mummy
came to look for her today.

65
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:25,906
Apparently, Risi has been lying to her
mum that she has been coming for lesson.

66
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:28,426
I was just shocked.

67
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:30,656
- Look…
- Anu.

68
00:04:30,736 --> 00:04:32,216
- Ma?
- Anu.

69
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:35,736
- Ma?
- Remember the daughter of whom you are!

70
00:04:37,056 --> 00:04:39,246
Especially now that
you're going to the university.

71
00:04:39,256 --> 00:04:41,916
Don't do these kind
of things. Don't do anything

72
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:43,506
that will make me sorrow over you.

73
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:47,836
Hmm! It is four eyes that born a child.

74
00:04:48,016 --> 00:04:51,536
- But now it is only two eyes that...
- Eyes that is nurturing. Argh!

75
00:04:51,576 --> 00:04:53,856
Be calming down!

76
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:56,376
This is why I don't like to give you gist.

77
00:04:56,536 --> 00:05:00,746
Small gist I gave you,
you've turned it into a lecture.

78
00:05:00,816 --> 00:05:02,796
I wish, above all things,

79
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,946
- that you shall prosper.
- Yes!

80
00:05:04,976 --> 00:05:07,296
Have I given you reason to doubt it?

81
00:05:07,536 --> 00:05:10,346
- Still...
- Oh Mummy, come on!

82
00:05:12,816 --> 00:05:15,096
- Who?
- Your son!

83
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:18,136
Anu, go and open the door for him.

84
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,296
Wow, really?

85
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:29,056
No problem?

86
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:32,756
- We're on strike.
- Again?

87
00:05:32,816 --> 00:05:36,126
I'm tired of that school.
Any small conflict, a strike starts.

88
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:40,026
Anu, go look for something for him to eat.

89
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,176
But you could have waited
till tomorrow morning before coming.

90
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,521
You should have waited till morning.

91
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:46,594
How long is this strike for now?

92
00:05:46,644 --> 00:05:48,816
Hopefully not too long. But…

93
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:50,487
at least we will spend time together.

94
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:52,569
Did you wear a belt?

95
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:57,472
Three days.

96
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:03,037
Anu. Anu said I should tell you
that she has started the small chops.

97
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:06,000
Really?

98
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,122
She said that you should send a sample.

99
00:06:08,963 --> 00:06:10,965
Yes.

100
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:13,287
He even showed up yesterday.

101
00:06:14,288 --> 00:06:18,211
He said that UNILAG
has sent them back due to a strike.

102
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,014
Oh okay, ma.

103
00:06:21,134 --> 00:06:23,496
Okay. See you. Thank you.

104
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:28,461
- Mummy, good morning.
- Good morning.

105
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:30,903
Have you swept?
Have you swept the compound?

106
00:06:30,983 --> 00:06:32,104
Yes, ma.

107
00:06:32,264 --> 00:06:34,146
- You have swept the compound?
- Yes, ma.

108
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:36,869
After taking your bath,

109
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:40,112
go and buy something…
something we can cook for soup.

110
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:42,834
Because this evening,
maybe I won't come back.

111
00:06:43,395 --> 00:06:45,597
That my customer, the one in Ikoyi…

112
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:47,679
The one with the baby, she has come back.

113
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,280
She has brought her baby back.

114
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:53,484
- So I'm going there for three days.
- Mummy, I want to follow you.

115
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:56,287
- Hmm?
- To go and do wetin?

116
00:06:57,488 --> 00:07:01,542
Sista. "What," not "wetin."

117
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,857
Okay. To go and do what?

118
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:10,100
To go and enjoy AC.

119
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,262
To go and enjoy AC.

120
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:16,506
When you have money,
you will buy AC for us.

121
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:18,908
For now, go and be watching television.

122
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:22,511
Alright, alright. Go on with you!

123
00:07:23,112 --> 00:07:25,794
I want to read the book
of Proverbs in the bible.

124
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:32,360
- So…
- Ah, no "so"!

125
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:34,481
- There's nothing like "so."
- What is the decision?

126
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:37,205
Eh she can't stay with me.

127
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,863
She should just follow her husband.

128
00:07:38,887 --> 00:07:40,927
They should start living
as a couple and that's all.

129
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:42,730
- Neither can she stay here.
- Indeed!

130
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,853
Look, it's not possible.
Fola, it cannot work.

131
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:49,456
Since you decided to taste
what married people are eating…

132
00:07:49,777 --> 00:07:52,819
What's left? You should
go and live together as man and wife.

133
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,702
But it cannot happen under my roof.

134
00:07:55,902 --> 00:07:58,144
- No way. No.
- Mummy, please…

135
00:07:58,305 --> 00:08:02,589
Fola, so you knew
that but went ahead and slept with her!

136
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:04,630
Don't provoke me! Eh?

137
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:06,672
You are now saying, "Mummy, please."

138
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,675
- You see? Tell them.
- Right?

139
00:08:09,835 --> 00:08:11,557
- You know how we are.
- Of course.

140
00:08:11,637 --> 00:08:13,879
What I gathered from my meager earnings

141
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:16,241
that I managed and I suffered

142
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,003
to send you to school…

143
00:08:18,053 --> 00:08:20,005
you then went and got someone pregnant?

144
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:22,287
Is this my reward? Eh, Fola?

145
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:25,580
Do I deserve this?

146
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,572
- Mummy, please.
- Shut your mouth!

147
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:29,614
Which Mummy are you asking "Please"? Argh!

148
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,135
Victoria!

149
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:36,340
He did all sort of things
to your body while enjoying himself.

150
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,263
My sister will be rolling in her grave!

151
00:08:40,344 --> 00:08:43,146
- Uncle, please. Please, sir.
- Erm…

152
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:44,748
- Fola?
- Sir.

153
00:08:44,798 --> 00:08:48,151
Victoria… You both have heard your mums.

154
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:51,194
- Please, sir.
- The ball now is in your court.

155
00:08:51,634 --> 00:08:54,037
- Ah, it's not, sir.
- Both of you need to make a decision.

156
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:55,878
- Uncle.
- Hmm?

157
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:57,720
Why are you talking like this?

158
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,082
- They've already made the decision.
- That's right!

159
00:09:00,242 --> 00:09:02,685
They've chosen the right path
that they prefer.

160
00:09:02,965 --> 00:09:05,367
Don't let us waste our time on them.

161
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:08,010
Fola.

162
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,172
Since you believe in yourself

163
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:13,134
that you are man enough
to become a father,

164
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:17,538
I cannot be feeding you,
feeding your wife and this unborn child.

165
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:20,781
- That's not possible.
- Come on! Do you want to kill me?

166
00:09:20,982 --> 00:09:23,104
I have your siblings
that I want to take care of.

167
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:24,345
So let me take care of them.

168
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,026
Don't kill me, okay?

169
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:30,871
- If I stopped school now…
- I'm not asking you to stop school now.

170
00:09:31,031 --> 00:09:33,113
Then what about you?

171
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:38,918
Eh, after this exam we will have a break.

172
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:41,200
I can use that break to look for work.

173
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:45,404
Who would give you work
in your pregnant condition?

174
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:51,730
- Where will you live?
- Can't I live with you?

175
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:53,972
Live with me, how?

176
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:56,094
Didn't you hear what my mother said?

177
00:09:56,254 --> 00:09:59,137
Oh, I'm not staying in your house.

178
00:09:59,217 --> 00:10:02,420
You said you live off campus, right?
I can live with you there.

179
00:10:05,943 --> 00:10:08,506
How will you feed?
I can barely fend for myself.

180
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:13,831
Isn't it at school?
There'll be plenty students in school and

181
00:10:14,151 --> 00:10:19,276
I'm sure there will be different types
of businesses I can do in school.

182
00:10:19,997 --> 00:10:23,640
I'll… work on that.

183
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:42,593
- Wow, Super Noodles Maker!
- Leave me alone.

184
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:47,598
Everyone is talking about your noodles.

185
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,522
Me, I'm just happy.

186
00:11:51,722 --> 00:11:56,206
At least by Saturday
we can get new baby stuff.

187
00:11:56,326 --> 00:11:59,809
- Wow.
- I saved up some money already.

188
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,733
- The baby is due anytime soon.
- Hmm.

189
00:12:04,294 --> 00:12:07,697
- So this one is for the House Seven boys.
- Right.

190
00:12:07,897 --> 00:12:11,540
Quadri and his friends asked me
to make saari food for them.

191
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,903
I'll make it, but you have
to help me deliver by five a.m.

192
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,185
No problem.

193
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:22,150
Erm, let me go with this one then
I'll tell Victor to come and pick me.

194
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:42,289
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

195
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,897
Petrol.

196
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:55,021
Don't turn it on by…
in fact, eight thirty.

197
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:59,345
Don't turn it on before eight thirty p.m.
I know there won't be light,

198
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:02,107
but eight thirty. There it is.

199
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:09,394
Ah-ah.

200
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:15,920
- Leave the way for me please!
- Mummy, you are not going anywhere.

201
00:13:16,281 --> 00:13:18,923
Fola, tell her.

202
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:22,566
Really?

203
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:25,049
If not that I have these

204
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:28,492
many mouths to feed, you think
I will go to work everyday like this?

205
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:35,378
- "Ee rees wharree rees." Alright.
- Sista, you say, "It is what it is."

206
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:43,786
It is… what it is.

207
00:13:44,827 --> 00:13:49,121
- Mummy, "it is what it is."
- Oh, idea is need, you these children.

208
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:52,274
I need to go to work.
Come on, leave the way.

209
00:13:52,474 --> 00:13:55,397
- Let's follow you. Let me follow you.
- To where?

210
00:13:55,717 --> 00:13:57,799
This one is an office.

211
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:02,404
But I want to help.
And Fola can help too. Fola, tell her.

212
00:14:02,564 --> 00:14:06,728
Yes, Mummy. You are tired. And remember we
still had to rub your body the other day.

213
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:09,931
If you don't go for this one,
will the earth stop?

214
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:11,692
Really? Will it stop?

215
00:14:12,013 --> 00:14:15,736
All these payments of this,
payments for that. Won't it stop?

216
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:18,018
Right.

217
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:23,463
I have to go to work. I know
you children are trying to help.

218
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:27,547
But this is new customer is an office, eh?

219
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,470
If anything goes missing there,
how will I buy it?

220
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,392
Stay at home. Let me go and work the work.

221
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:38,717
All this stress I'm going through
is for you children to have a better life.

222
00:14:38,998 --> 00:14:42,361
And to have all
these things that I did not have.

223
00:14:42,561 --> 00:14:46,324
And I am praying for both of you,
that you will succeed.

224
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:49,127
And then, save me out
of this trouble I'm going through. Right?

225
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:53,611
You think I don't want the good life?
Rolling my buttocks on a ship?

226
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:58,095
- Or a motorboat?
- You better not do it in a thong!

227
00:14:59,056 --> 00:15:02,019
- What is thong?
- G-string.

228
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:04,101
Ah! Catapult? No.

229
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:08,585
Lace. You'll buy me lace. Two of you.
I'll be dancing like this.

230
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:13,109
I hope that with these few points of mine,

231
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,513
I have been able to convince
and not confuse you that…

232
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:20,636
I need to go to work
for the betterment of all. Did I get it?

233
00:15:21,277 --> 00:15:24,680
Now, move or I move you.
Oh, these children!

234
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,243
Come on, come on. I have to leave now.

235
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:32,808
- I love you so much, Mummy.
- I love you too, hmm?

236
00:15:32,968 --> 00:15:35,370
I love you.

237
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,613
Argh! Allow me go to work. Don't forget…

238
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:42,677
Don't put it on until eight thirty,
in fact nine thirty.

239
00:15:42,737 --> 00:15:45,379
- Okay, Mummy. Bye.
- Okay, bye-bye.

240
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:48,222
Rolling your buttocks…

241
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:01,795
Wow, Auntie Jay?

242
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:04,717
- I hope there's no problem?
- Erm…

243
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:09,642
- Ah. Hope no problem?
- No problem.

244
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,204
Um, Mrs. Uzo…

245
00:16:12,324 --> 00:16:17,209
Erm, actually, she accused you…

246
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,092
No, she insisted that we

247
00:16:20,172 --> 00:16:21,773
- come here that there's...
- Um, so

248
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:25,377
my set of gold is missing. A whole set.

249
00:16:25,497 --> 00:16:29,541
And seeing that you were the last
person to my home before I traveled,

250
00:16:29,941 --> 00:16:31,823
we need to search your house.

251
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:37,708
Ahn-ahn. Aunty Jay, I don't understand
what she is saying?

252
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:43,714
She insisted that um, we come here

253
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:48,879
- so that she can check…
- Why is she accusing me?

254
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:50,496
No, she's not accusing… ahn-ahn.

255
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,282
No, she's not
accusing you, I swear by Allah.

256
00:16:52,962 --> 00:16:54,724
I've told her that I trust you.

257
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:58,347
I told her that I trust you so we should
come so that she will see for herself...

258
00:16:58,378 --> 00:17:00,369
I don't have all day.

259
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,413
- Guys. Nonso, come check here.
- Wait! Wait.

260
00:17:09,658 --> 00:17:12,861
- My children are inside. Just wait for me.
- I don't understand.

261
00:17:13,101 --> 00:17:14,863
So you will go
and have them hide my stuff?

262
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:16,224
Come on, Mrs. Uzo!

263
00:17:16,344 --> 00:17:18,386
- Oh please.
- Mrs. Uzo, I beg you in God's Name,

264
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:21,109
Stop doing that. Be easy here.

265
00:17:27,795 --> 00:17:30,397
In my 11 years of doing this job,

266
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:32,639
nobody has ever accused me of stealing!

267
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,401
Nobody!

268
00:17:34,481 --> 00:17:36,643
No problem.

269
00:17:36,843 --> 00:17:41,247
Hmm, Anu! Fola! Come outside!

270
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:51,817
- What's happening?
- She said I stole her gold.

271
00:17:52,898 --> 00:17:57,262
- Ma'am, I think...
- Hey Fola! Come. Come here.

272
00:17:58,223 --> 00:18:01,746
This is part of the stigma
experienced in this job. Just come here.

273
00:18:02,627 --> 00:18:04,719
Alright, go in.
You can go search everywhere.

274
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:08,513
- Ifeanyi, quickly.
- Search the house everywhere, no problem.

275
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:11,956
Please search everywhere.
All the nooks and crannies.

276
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:15,639
You, Aunty? In my house?

277
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:21,525
Ah, no problem, Aunty Jay.
There's no problem.

278
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:23,607
Um, come. Ifeanyi.

279
00:18:24,327 --> 00:18:25,649
Nonso!

280
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,692
Let's go Come. Let's leave here.

281
00:18:30,253 --> 00:18:32,415
Go? You are not searching again?

282
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:37,099
Erm, I just found out who took it.

283
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:38,501
Huh?

284
00:18:38,901 --> 00:18:39,982
What did just say?

285
00:18:40,943 --> 00:18:45,066
- Erm, Sista, I am so sorry, I...
- Aunty…

286
00:18:45,267 --> 00:18:48,109
- Please go.
- Oh my God.

287
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,192
- Sista, I will give them money...
- Madam I say, come and go!

288
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:59,520
Aunty Jay…

289
00:19:03,524 --> 00:19:06,527
You are back. How did it go?

290
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,257
I'm pregnant.

291
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,381
Ah-ah?

292
00:19:26,385 --> 00:19:28,227
How, how come?

293
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,150
What do you mean, how come?

294
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,353
I don't mean it that way.

295
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,877
So what do you mean?

296
00:19:39,998 --> 00:19:43,041
I have been pulling out, have I not been?

297
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:51,408
So, who says pulling out
means 100 percent guarantee?

298
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,413
Vicky, I've been pulling out.
This pregnancy cannot be mine.

299
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:58,775
I don't understand.

300
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:03,540
Maybe you should go and help me
to do erm, a newspaper advert or…

301
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,981
yes, a publication.

302
00:20:05,381 --> 00:20:09,145
To know who the real owner is.
Because I don't understand.

303
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:13,749
What do you want me to say? Huh? What?

304
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,232
What do I want you to say?
To say that everything will be okay.

305
00:20:17,673 --> 00:20:21,396
And that everything will be fine.
You don't have to deny the baby.

306
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:25,320
Ah! That's a very
big insult on my character.

307
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,604
That is a very, very big
insult on my character, Fola!

308
00:20:29,884 --> 00:20:31,926
Sorry, okay? Sorry.

309
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,891
- Sorry for yourself.
- But I don't need this now.

310
00:20:37,411 --> 00:20:39,493
We don't need this now.

311
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:41,735
I have a professional
exam I'm preparing for.

312
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:45,419
I go for service in one month. A baby
doesn't fit into this picture at all.

313
00:20:45,699 --> 00:20:47,901
We already have one
that we're struggling to take...

314
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,262
No, no, no. Fola, wait.

315
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:55,028
You mean that I, Fola,
that I am struggling to take care of.

316
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:58,271
Feeding you, the baby and me.

317
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:00,353
- Paying for your school fees.
- Wait, wait!

318
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:01,650
So I've not been doing anything?

319
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:03,772
I've not been doing anything, right?
So I'm useless now?

320
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:05,717
Eh? I don't help you? Don't I help you?

321
00:21:05,758 --> 00:21:08,720
Don't I clean the baby's bum when he poos?

322
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:11,393
Even in the night
when he cannot sleep, I help you!

323
00:21:11,483 --> 00:21:14,295
I do something in this house!
Don't tell me that I don't do anything.

324
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,567
Don't say that!

325
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:19,250
Alright, sorry. I am sorry, eh?

326
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:22,533
Sorry, don't be angry.
See, I don't want us to fight.

327
00:21:22,693 --> 00:21:27,458
Tomorrow, I'll go and see
the doctor and I'll do… maybe an abortion.

328
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,500
And, we will see how it is.

329
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,783
I think I'm 16 weeks pregnant.

330
00:21:33,063 --> 00:21:34,344
I can still…

331
00:21:34,985 --> 00:21:38,228
- I'll have to abort it.
- Sixteen weeks?

332
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:43,593
You've been 16 weeks pregnant
and I didn't know?

333
00:21:44,153 --> 00:21:45,575
Fola, I've not seen
my period since I had Junior.

334
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,916
Where did you keep it?

335
00:21:46,996 --> 00:21:49,318
Oh God!

336
00:21:49,398 --> 00:21:52,041
Vicky, why? Why?

337
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:56,925
Shit, shit, shit!

338
00:21:57,246 --> 00:21:59,368
Which one is all this
"shit, shit" you are saying?

339
00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:01,249
I said tomorrow, I'll go and see Doctor.

340
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:04,372
Sixteen weeks… they should be able
to remove it. What's all the "shit"?

341
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:07,415
I said I do abortion,
you're saying "shit, shit." Ah!

342
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:11,278
Look, that's all I can say.
I will see you later.

343
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:13,781
- I can't do more than this.
- What?

344
00:22:14,101 --> 00:22:20,107
- Am I happy being pregnant?
- At every little touch, you get pregnant.

345
00:22:21,268 --> 00:22:23,790
She doesn't listen.
She just does not listen.

346
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:26,152
How do you live your life
just to please a man?

347
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:28,595
There is more to a woman
than just pleasing a man.

348
00:22:28,675 --> 00:22:30,156
Hmm, true.

349
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:31,598
- Truth, Aunty Jay.
- Mm-hmm.

350
00:22:31,878 --> 00:22:36,762
But this thing… Hmm.
It's not straight like that.

351
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:38,404
Anyway…

352
00:22:40,406 --> 00:22:41,927
You miss him, right?

353
00:22:43,609 --> 00:22:44,770
Who?

354
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:49,174
Ah-ah? You late husband, of course.

355
00:22:50,655 --> 00:22:54,139
How many years has it been now?

356
00:22:56,341 --> 00:23:00,384
I stopped keeping track
when it was ten years.

357
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:06,750
So you mean that none of
your in-laws came to look for you?

358
00:23:10,113 --> 00:23:14,197
It's better this way, Aunty Jay.
It's better this way.

359
00:23:14,758 --> 00:23:16,960
- Hmm, Aunty Jay.
- What is it?

360
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,124
This man. This your lover…
When are you going to…

361
00:23:21,564 --> 00:23:23,486
When are you going to let him marry you?

362
00:23:23,726 --> 00:23:27,570
If you are a bit
submissive, he will put a ring on it.

363
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:31,613
Me I should "put body for ground"?
Or he should put his body on the ground?

364
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:33,965
Or even, he should put
his head on the ground.

365
00:23:34,056 --> 00:23:36,508
Because that is the problem.
The woman is putting her body…

366
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:38,730
All the time. What about the man?

367
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,764
If he put his head on the ground,
me I will put my head on the ground.

368
00:23:42,784 --> 00:23:46,627
- Two of us we will marry. Until then…
- Aunty Jay!

369
00:23:46,747 --> 00:23:49,710
I like your fire!

370
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,355
Aunty Jay, thank you for this food.
So it means today no more cleaning?

371
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:58,799
- Have we not finished talking about that?
- Aunty Jay!

372
00:24:01,161 --> 00:24:05,125
- Let me hurry fast and start going home.
- Um, before you go…

373
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,928
There's something I need to give you.

374
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:10,570
- Again?
- Hmm.

375
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,612
- Ah-ah! Aunty Jay…
- Hmm?

376
00:24:13,893 --> 00:24:17,296
Hope it's not from that erm, Mrs…

377
00:24:17,576 --> 00:24:19,647
- Mrs. Uzo?
- Mrs. Uzo.

378
00:24:19,678 --> 00:24:23,382
- It is not from her.
- Aunty Jay, I don't want problem.

379
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:27,585
Already, I have promised myself
that after what happened yesterday,

380
00:24:27,706 --> 00:24:32,190
there is no business
joining you and her together again.

381
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,432
Did you see what happened yesterday?

382
00:24:34,552 --> 00:24:36,874
What happened yesterday
can never repeat itself.

383
00:24:36,994 --> 00:24:40,317
I did not like it at all.

384
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:43,640
Aunty Jay. And that day

385
00:24:44,001 --> 00:24:49,926
when I was heading there,
I was double-minded about working there.

386
00:24:50,126 --> 00:24:54,851
I even called her, so she can
take an inventory. She said no.

387
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:58,254
Not knowing
she had plans to put me in trouble.

388
00:24:58,534 --> 00:25:03,138
That thing she did in front
of my children, Aunty Jay?

389
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,430
I'm sorry. Please.

390
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:08,664
Just forgive her and let it go.
I beg you in God's name.

391
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,225
I use God to beg you.

392
00:25:10,946 --> 00:25:13,708
But should I tell you who was
the person who took the jewelry?

393
00:25:13,788 --> 00:25:14,829
Who?

394
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,832
Hmm! You will not believe.
It was her husband.

395
00:25:17,912 --> 00:25:18,953
Ah!

396
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:21,035
- Shocking!
- They said he has uh…

397
00:25:21,195 --> 00:25:26,000
a gambling problem. So, he used her
gold, her full set to go and pay for it.

398
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,964
Oh! Now, I'm feeling sorry for her.

399
00:25:31,565 --> 00:25:34,648
Ah, I forgive her. I forgive her.

400
00:25:35,088 --> 00:25:38,612
Anu, so you take all these for school.

401
00:25:39,052 --> 00:25:41,214
Ha! Sista, no.

402
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:44,297
This is you trying to say
you will not take me for shopping.

403
00:25:44,897 --> 00:25:47,940
- Promise is a death.
- "Debt," ma.

404
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,184
"A promise is a debt."
Nobody is dying here, please.

405
00:25:52,304 --> 00:25:54,586
So, it's the person
that will take you for shopping

406
00:25:54,667 --> 00:25:56,027
that you are talking to like that?

407
00:25:56,188 --> 00:25:59,031
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

408
00:26:00,312 --> 00:26:04,516
- Mummy, I want to go back to school.
- Have you resumed?

409
00:26:05,036 --> 00:26:07,318
English, ma.

410
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,842
- Have you resume?
- Has school resumed?

411
00:26:10,962 --> 00:26:13,484
Argh, Fola, just answer.

412
00:26:13,924 --> 00:26:19,009
No. But I got a tutoring offer for some
carryover students. And they're paying.

413
00:26:21,732 --> 00:26:22,813
Fola?

414
00:26:24,254 --> 00:26:27,177
Did you ask me for money and I say no?

415
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,341
No, but it's just that
this cleaning stress is too much.

416
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:33,543
And if I can make
some small money on the side,

417
00:26:33,563 --> 00:26:35,664
maybe you'll stop working
on Sunday, at least.

418
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,313
So Sunday is the problem. I will stop.

419
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:49,037
Mummy, it's not that. It's not that.
I'm already an adult now.

420
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:51,600
And besides, you said you
and daddy had me around this age.

421
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,402
So why can't you allow me to help?

422
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:01,289
Fola, you see that school?

423
00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:05,092
I want you to go there, focused like this.

424
00:27:05,853 --> 00:27:07,855
No distraction.

425
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,417
I want you to focus.

426
00:27:11,738 --> 00:27:17,223
This stress you are complaining about,
in two years' time now, you will forget.

427
00:27:18,024 --> 00:27:22,188
Then you will face me. Me too,
I will now relax and be taken care of.

428
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:25,551
- What's making her laugh?
- Mummy, don't worry.

429
00:27:26,032 --> 00:27:27,313
I promise.

430
00:27:27,393 --> 00:27:30,916
I will work hard, and
I will spoil you with plenty money.

431
00:27:31,837 --> 00:27:34,970
Don't spoil me.
You will repair me with money.

432
00:27:37,803 --> 00:27:40,685
Fola, do we have a deal?

433
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:46,931
- Do we have a deal?
- Yes, Mummy.

434
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,218
Uh, who is that? Come in.

435
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:00,784
- Ta-da!
- Tiwa!

436
00:28:01,344 --> 00:28:04,467
Tiwa!

437
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:10,233
Look at you! I cannot believe this.

438
00:28:10,353 --> 00:28:13,075
Yeah, we came in a couple of weeks ago.

439
00:28:13,796 --> 00:28:18,120
- A what?! A what?!
- Couple of weeks. Relax!

440
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,603
- Come on, Tiwa!
- We were in Abuja. FA had some work to do

441
00:28:21,683 --> 00:28:24,836
So we had to stop by the office.
I couldn't get a phone number

442
00:28:24,886 --> 00:28:26,888
because it's like,
you literally have to draw blood

443
00:28:26,948 --> 00:28:29,661
- to get a phone number in Naija, honestly.
- Hmm.

444
00:28:29,771 --> 00:28:32,453
- Hmm?!
- I'm serious! Come on.

445
00:28:32,654 --> 00:28:36,297
- Nothing beats a good surprise though.
- Nothing beats a good surprise.

446
00:28:36,537 --> 00:28:39,276
You know, I thought it was my client.
I was already working on her designs.

447
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,663
Although I could be your client.

448
00:28:43,143 --> 00:28:45,746
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

449
00:28:45,826 --> 00:28:48,478
- Hmm. This is really good.
- It is, right?

450
00:28:48,669 --> 00:28:51,721
Yeah. So, the kids are now
in boarding school in England.

451
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:54,754
And we're going
to be here for a year and a half.

452
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,317
Yes, to start the company's
Africa-side of things.

453
00:28:57,397 --> 00:28:58,838
That is amazing!

454
00:28:58,918 --> 00:29:02,111
- Um, so have you found anything yet?
- Er, the company got us some space,

455
00:29:02,161 --> 00:29:04,964
but I really need your expertise.
I need you to do it up.

456
00:29:05,124 --> 00:29:07,526
Look, I cannot wait to do it.

457
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:10,929
I hope you know
you are going to pay me in euros.

458
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:14,573
Because there's no way I am going
to collect naira currency from you.

459
00:29:14,693 --> 00:29:17,215
Please don't just charge me
too much, I beg you by God.

460
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:20,338
- What did you say, "Danallah"?
- Oh stop!

461
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:24,201
I am guessing that you haven't had
anyone to speak Hausa with in ages.

462
00:29:24,251 --> 00:29:27,264
- Nobody at all. Nobody.
- Ah, that is why. I can only imagine.

463
00:29:27,545 --> 00:29:31,468
But for the space, we have to set up
an appointment so that I can see it.

464
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:34,912
And then we can know what we
are renovating, how you want it to look.

465
00:29:35,032 --> 00:29:37,674
And then run ideas by you,
whatever it is that you want us to do.

466
00:29:37,794 --> 00:29:41,157
- That's totally fine. Is tomorrow okay?
- Oh, tomorrow is perfect.

467
00:29:41,277 --> 00:29:45,992
Make sure you text me the address and…
Ooh! The food is here!

468
00:29:46,002 --> 00:29:47,603
- It is?
- It is.

469
00:29:48,164 --> 00:29:51,407
- OMG!
- Thank you so much.

470
00:29:51,487 --> 00:29:52,728
I promise you, Tiwa,

471
00:29:52,808 --> 00:29:54,850
- you will love this ofada.
- Thank you.

472
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:58,253
- The sauce is amazing.
- I need to take a picture.

473
00:29:58,333 --> 00:30:01,616
- Take a picture.
- Oh my gosh.

474
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:08,183
Did I offend you?

475
00:30:09,824 --> 00:30:10,985
No.

476
00:30:13,628 --> 00:30:15,269
So why are you not talking to me?

477
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:21,795
You didn't do anything.
I'm… I'm just nervous.

478
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:26,399
Nervous about what?

479
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,561
Is it about me?

480
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:31,805
Or the baby? Or Youth Corper?

481
00:30:32,445 --> 00:30:36,289
Youth Service.
It's Youth Service, not Youth Corper.

482
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,933
Sorry.

483
00:30:41,854 --> 00:30:43,816
So…

484
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:46,098
When are you coming back?

485
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:50,142
- After service.
- That's like one year, right?

486
00:31:14,364 --> 00:31:17,367
At least, before they pay salary,

487
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:22,061
you will have something small to use
to fend for yourself.

488
00:31:26,215 --> 00:31:29,018
No. You need this more than I do.

489
00:31:29,658 --> 00:31:33,222
I'm okay. Me and the baby will be fine.

490
00:31:33,582 --> 00:31:35,464
- I have shop.
- No.

491
00:31:35,824 --> 00:31:38,467
- Ah-ah..
- Please just take it.

492
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:57,164
I'm sorry if I offended you.

493
00:32:00,047 --> 00:32:04,571
Sister erm, my cousin's husband
just uh, he works in Amsterdam.

494
00:32:06,332 --> 00:32:10,016
But they have like
a new branch of the office here.

495
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,177
Really?

496
00:32:11,257 --> 00:32:13,259
- What of her?
- Hmm.

497
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:15,421
She is a full time housewife.

498
00:32:15,541 --> 00:32:17,583
But I'm thinking, now that she said that

499
00:32:17,663 --> 00:32:19,675
the children are in boarding school,

500
00:32:19,745 --> 00:32:23,508
maybe, she might decide to get a job.

501
00:32:23,589 --> 00:32:27,161
Having a job is good.
Look at you now, Aunty Jay.

502
00:32:27,332 --> 00:32:30,435
Hmm, I don't have a husband.

503
00:32:31,035 --> 00:32:33,838
Aunty Jay, have you
chased um, that brother away?

504
00:32:33,878 --> 00:32:36,921
I did not chase him but
he has not asked me to marry him.

505
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:40,564
For a while now,
we've been doing "relationship."

506
00:32:40,965 --> 00:32:45,649
- A good man will ask you.
- Amen. The right man has to come.

507
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:50,133
You hear me, all you right men out there?!

508
00:32:51,414 --> 00:32:53,232
But Sista, there is
something I want to tell you.

509
00:32:53,256 --> 00:32:54,297
Okay.

510
00:32:54,377 --> 00:32:58,431
This house that we are going to,
you will clean it very well.

511
00:32:58,501 --> 00:33:02,184
I know that you clean well
but you know this is a first time client.

512
00:33:02,345 --> 00:33:05,988
So I want them to retain you.
So I want you to clean it very well

513
00:33:05,998 --> 00:33:08,190
so that when they see it,
they will know that, "Ah!

514
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,392
This one, we are keeping her."

515
00:33:10,552 --> 00:33:12,474
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

516
00:33:25,406 --> 00:33:27,088
Hello!

517
00:33:27,328 --> 00:33:29,730
- Sista?
- Ah, Aunty Jay!

518
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,987
- I've finished!
- You have finished?

519
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:33,614
This extra one is just dusting.

520
00:33:33,694 --> 00:33:35,555
Sorry I take long.

521
00:33:35,616 --> 00:33:39,219
- It is okay. This is my cousin, Tiwatope.
- Good afternoon, ma.

522
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:42,342
- Nice to meet you. You did this yourself?
- Ah, yes. Yes.

523
00:33:42,822 --> 00:33:46,616
When I clean people's house and
office, I don't use to take anybody.

524
00:33:46,636 --> 00:33:48,027
I always go alone.

525
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:52,221
So that if something miss
or break, I can only know my own heart.

526
00:33:52,351 --> 00:33:54,233
I can't know for the other person.

527
00:33:54,593 --> 00:33:56,115
That's FA.

528
00:33:56,355 --> 00:33:58,653
- Oh, he's coming?
- Yes, I asked him to come see the house.

529
00:33:58,677 --> 00:34:00,239
- Oh, okay.
- Yes.

530
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:02,911
FA, my guy! Ah-ah, come on.

531
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:07,155
- Hello. It's good to see you again.
- Good to see you. How are you?

532
00:34:07,405 --> 00:34:11,329
- Hello, darling.
- Oppress us.

533
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:15,333
- Erm Sista, this is my husband.
- Good afternoon, sir.

534
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:18,015
- FA, this is the cleaning lady.
- Good to meet you, madam.

535
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:19,577
- Yes, sir.
- Good to meet you.

536
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,557
So are you ready
to see what the house looks like?

537
00:34:21,578 --> 00:34:22,739
Sure.

538
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,063
Alright baby, let's go.
Let's go check it out.

539
00:34:26,223 --> 00:34:28,825
Sista, I hope you are well. Are you okay?

540
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:33,039
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes. Please help me do transfer.

541
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:37,433
Because after I finish
just mopping the step, I will be going.

542
00:34:37,513 --> 00:34:38,995
No, just wait. I will drop you off.

543
00:34:39,075 --> 00:34:41,517
- Let me just enter quickly.
- No, I'm going to market.

544
00:34:41,837 --> 00:34:43,769
Oh okay, no problem.

545
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:46,941
But you know the phones
you said that I should help you get… ah.

546
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:51,186
- They are in the car.
- Am I owing you something?

547
00:34:51,286 --> 00:34:55,210
So if you are owing me,
you think I'll collect the money from you?

548
00:36:25,374 --> 00:36:26,855
Lord, thank you.

549
00:37:06,372 --> 00:37:10,255
Ah! Fola has ruined me. Someone help me!

550
00:37:10,776 --> 00:37:14,419
Fola.

551
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:22,947
I'm dead!

552
00:37:23,428 --> 00:37:29,714
No. No, Fola! No!

553
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:34,678
Ah! Fola!

554
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:38,842
Ah! Yeh!

555
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:53,215
Oh my Defender!

556
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:58,300
Come in.

557
00:38:01,223 --> 00:38:03,945
- Good morning, Mummy.
- Fola.

558
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:08,950
My mother.

559
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:11,072
My rock.

560
00:38:12,633 --> 00:38:14,395
My everything.

561
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:20,521
Thank you for all you do for us.

562
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:27,087
- Mummy, is everything okay?
- It is fine.

563
00:38:27,928 --> 00:38:31,651
Everything is fine, Fola.
Everything is fine.

564
00:38:32,372 --> 00:38:34,334
I'm just thinking.

565
00:38:35,455 --> 00:38:38,377
About what? About us?

566
00:38:39,338 --> 00:38:41,701
You are also part
of what I'm thinking about.

567
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:45,864
Mummy, you know we try not to stress you.

568
00:38:46,945 --> 00:38:51,630
- Are we putting you under any pressure?
- God forbids it.

569
00:38:53,071 --> 00:38:54,713
God forbids it.

570
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:01,719
Sit down.

571
00:39:04,962 --> 00:39:09,006
You are my children. You and Anu.

572
00:39:09,727 --> 00:39:14,051
And it is you, the two of you,
that gives me the strength

573
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:18,535
and the power to smile.

574
00:39:19,616 --> 00:39:22,098
You are not a problem to me.
Have you heard?

575
00:39:22,418 --> 00:39:24,340
- Yes.
- Have you heard?

576
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,701
Yes.

577
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:28,544
But are you sure?

578
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:30,226
You know I'm your stand-in husband.

579
00:39:30,346 --> 00:39:32,228
So you can always tell me
if anything is wrong?

580
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:38,754
Olu… Olufolarin. Olufolarin.

581
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,721
There is no problem.

582
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:50,444
- So you will talk to me?
- I will talk to you.

583
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:59,012
Anu is making custard and akara.
And we are watching Rofia Tailor Loran.

584
00:40:00,013 --> 00:40:03,096
Sista will go now.
Sista will brush her teeth.

585
00:40:03,136 --> 00:40:05,418
I will wash my teeth,
white, white, shining.

586
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:07,701
I will come and drink ogi
with you, and akara.

587
00:40:07,861 --> 00:40:09,262
Have you heard, my dear?

588
00:40:10,463 --> 00:40:13,255
I will come
and join you soon. I'll take the ogi.

589
00:40:13,426 --> 00:40:16,589
Fola, you make me happy.
You and Anu, okay.

590
00:40:16,669 --> 00:40:18,110
- I'm coming.
- Okay, Mum.

591
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,332
Hello, lya lyabo?

592
00:40:41,612 --> 00:40:42,773
What happened?

593
00:40:43,814 --> 00:40:46,897
Town council?

594
00:40:47,377 --> 00:40:49,860
I'm in trouble! Hello?

595
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:57,067
Okay.

596
00:41:02,311 --> 00:41:05,715
Hello, Aunty Jay.

597
00:41:06,355 --> 00:41:08,157
Do you have something good for me?

598
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,000
Really, Sunday?

599
00:41:13,882 --> 00:41:17,005
Oka… ah.

600
00:41:18,046 --> 00:41:21,609
I promised Fola
that I will not work on Sunday again.

601
00:41:24,972 --> 00:41:27,975
Ah, Anu small chop?

602
00:41:29,377 --> 00:41:31,288
Are you sure, Aunty Jay?

603
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:34,902
- She is not much of an expert.
- Aunty, I am a pro. Don't mind Sista.

604
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:40,027
She wants to talk to you.

605
00:41:41,948 --> 00:41:44,190
Hello, Aunty Jay.

606
00:43:53,751 --> 00:43:56,674
Hi. Can I get a drink?

607
00:44:00,277 --> 00:44:05,001
Oiza, this is really amazing, I swear.

608
00:44:05,362 --> 00:44:06,643
Yeah, thank you…

609
00:44:06,723 --> 00:44:09,165
- for the house. It's beautiful.
- It is, right?

610
00:44:09,245 --> 00:44:14,330
I love to do amazing interiors
for houses that I am well paid for.

611
00:44:14,771 --> 00:44:19,535
Judging by the dent in my bank account,
yes, you were well paid.

612
00:44:21,257 --> 00:44:22,578
Thank you.

613
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,263
- Er, the cleaner…
- Hmm.

614
00:44:28,343 --> 00:44:31,826
- How long has she worked with you for?
- Oh, Sista?

615
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:35,270
Hmm. Many years now.

616
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,673
And she's so good at what she does, right?

617
00:44:39,273 --> 00:44:41,155
Why do you ask?

618
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:44,738
Oh, it seems
like she's a very hardworking person.

619
00:44:44,798 --> 00:44:47,241
Oh, she's very hardworking, truly.

620
00:44:47,961 --> 00:44:50,284
I'd like to know
if she can come clean the office.

621
00:44:50,684 --> 00:44:54,927
Sista is a full definition of,
um, booked and busy.

622
00:44:54,968 --> 00:44:58,051
But, I think I can help you talk to her.

623
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:00,309
And see if she can fit you
into her schedule.

624
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:01,614
Cool.

625
00:45:03,216 --> 00:45:06,218
- Have you seen Tiwa around?
- Hmm…

626
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,102
- I think she is in the kitchen.
- Okay.

627
00:45:10,983 --> 00:45:13,705
Angels bow before him

628
00:45:15,027 --> 00:45:21,793
What a mighty God we serve
What a mighty…

629
00:45:23,635 --> 00:45:25,757
Any problem, sir?

630
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:29,961
- I'm looking for the small chops lady.
- Oh, my daughter.

631
00:45:30,201 --> 00:45:33,844
Ah-ah, she's in the parlor.
I left her outside, sir.

632
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:38,118
- Your daughter?
- Yes. Do you need anything, sir?

633
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:40,811
- No, no.
- My son, he will, he can do it.

634
00:45:42,452 --> 00:45:45,445
- That's your son?
- Um, okay.

635
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:47,577
- What do you need, sir?
- It's just, um,

636
00:45:47,617 --> 00:45:49,899
some new guests just arrived and I was…

637
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:51,741
I wanted them to be served so…

638
00:45:51,821 --> 00:45:54,423
Ah, new guests. I'd do it, sir.

639
00:45:54,623 --> 00:45:57,426
- I'll follow you now, sir.
- Okay.

640
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:04,313
So, basically just trying to manage
the whole work-life balance,

641
00:46:04,363 --> 00:46:08,216
family, business and all.
Yeah, it's really important

642
00:46:08,276 --> 00:46:10,318
- Thank you.
- Sir?

643
00:46:11,799 --> 00:46:13,641
Thank you, Vicky.

644
00:46:26,133 --> 00:46:28,255
- Yeah, enjoy.
- And you too.

645
00:46:31,097 --> 00:46:34,140
What year did you say you are in again?

646
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,403
- Two hundred level, sir.
- Two hundred level?

647
00:46:37,864 --> 00:46:40,426
You sound a lot more mature
than a 200-level student.

648
00:46:40,626 --> 00:46:43,619
- I get it from my mom.
- Fola, go on. Go and help your sister.

649
00:46:43,629 --> 00:46:47,753
Okay, Mom. Sorry excuse me, sir.

650
00:46:50,756 --> 00:46:54,920
Totally ridiculous
but it was such a great one, Jems.

651
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,515
Hey, baby.

652
00:47:00,885 --> 00:47:03,808
- FA, my guy.
- Hey.

653
00:47:04,048 --> 00:47:08,652
- That was exactly what happened that day.
- Yeah.

654
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,696
We're just going to
make it work. My schedule…

655
00:47:12,776 --> 00:47:14,057
Hey, um…

656
00:47:14,137 --> 00:47:16,780
You should come visit me
sometime soon, okay? Here's my card.

657
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,519
Oh okay, thank you very much, sir.
I also enjoyed our conversation.

658
00:47:19,543 --> 00:47:22,345
Fola, it is time. Ma'am, we have finished.

659
00:47:22,585 --> 00:47:25,989
Ah. Thank you so much for today.

660
00:47:26,149 --> 00:47:29,111
You have really amazing children.
They're very well behaved.

661
00:47:29,192 --> 00:47:30,593
Thank you very much, ma.

662
00:47:30,713 --> 00:47:32,584
Is Aunty Jay dropping us?

663
00:47:32,995 --> 00:47:36,238
You see, Tiwa hasn't released me yet.

664
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:41,403
- I… I can drop you off.
- Our house is a very far, sir. Thank you.

665
00:47:42,043 --> 00:47:46,287
Look, these two are still gossiping.
You better just let me drop you.

666
00:47:46,728 --> 00:47:51,813
Erm, my daughter
already call taxi. Let's go.

667
00:47:52,773 --> 00:47:54,735
Anu, head that way.

668
00:47:56,297 --> 00:47:58,929
- Thank you, sir.
- Goodnight, sir.

669
00:47:58,979 --> 00:48:00,220
Fola, come on.

670
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:01,998
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight. Thank you so much.

671
00:48:02,022 --> 00:48:04,064
- Aunty Jay, Jay, Jay!
- Goodnight, Sista.

672
00:48:04,144 --> 00:48:08,397
- And the small chops was amazing!
- Goodnight, Aunty Jay.

673
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,282
Is it the office?

674
00:49:07,443 --> 00:49:12,207
You've been pensive all week.
Did something happen at work?

675
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:21,976
- Can you forgive me?
- What for?

676
00:49:23,218 --> 00:49:26,220
What have you done, my darling?

677
00:49:28,062 --> 00:49:29,584
There's something I need to tell you.

678
00:49:32,426 --> 00:49:34,388
Okay.

679
00:49:37,631 --> 00:49:38,872
I made a mistake.

680
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:47,640
Okay.

681
00:50:10,141 --> 00:50:11,983
Who is she and how far gone?

682
00:50:14,706 --> 00:50:17,308
No. No, I'm not cheating.

683
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:23,994
I cheated but not on you.

684
00:50:25,155 --> 00:50:29,289
Someone else. I don't know how to fix it.

685
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,880
Who is it that you cheated on?
What are you talking about?

686
00:50:31,922 --> 00:50:35,045
- What, who with? I don't know.
- Oh my God.

687
00:50:37,327 --> 00:50:39,449
God forgive me.

688
00:50:42,692 --> 00:50:44,253
Tiwa, I…

689
00:50:47,896 --> 00:50:49,378
Tiwatope.

690
00:50:50,739 --> 00:50:52,741
There is no better way to say this.

691
00:50:56,504 --> 00:50:58,106
I umm…

692
00:50:59,107 --> 00:51:02,350
I… I have… I had…

693
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:06,113
a family.

694
00:51:08,396 --> 00:51:12,960
Folarin, I'm so… A family. I don't get it.

695
00:51:15,002 --> 00:51:17,004
I was 19.

696
00:51:17,604 --> 00:51:19,966
She was 17.

697
00:51:20,727 --> 00:51:23,289
We had a baby.

698
00:51:24,651 --> 00:51:27,653
Two and half years later, she had another.

699
00:51:29,015 --> 00:51:31,337
She was pregnant again and…

700
00:51:32,938 --> 00:51:34,940
I was just 21.

701
00:51:35,461 --> 00:51:38,143
Just graduated. I…

702
00:51:38,944 --> 00:51:41,667
It was too much. So…

703
00:51:43,028 --> 00:51:44,950
So I left.

704
00:51:47,072 --> 00:51:50,034
I left her and the kids.

705
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,329
Tiwa, say something.

706
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:15,378
Are you having a laugh?

707
00:52:15,498 --> 00:52:18,741
Folarin. Oh my gosh, you're joking, right?

708
00:52:23,465 --> 00:52:26,068
You're not joking?

709
00:52:32,554 --> 00:52:36,798
- You have a wife and children?
- No. We were never married.

710
00:52:37,438 --> 00:52:42,083
We dated as kids. She got pregnant.
We both got got kicked out of our homes.

711
00:52:42,763 --> 00:52:44,325
So she moved into school with me.

712
00:52:44,725 --> 00:52:48,238
While I was schooling,
she was trading to support us and…

713
00:52:48,289 --> 00:52:51,091
- And…
- And err…

714
00:52:51,492 --> 00:52:54,494
And you what? You abandoned them?

715
00:52:56,456 --> 00:52:57,737
You left!

716
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:03,142
Left the mother
of your children. You left!

717
00:53:04,624 --> 00:53:09,708
- A 19 year old woman.
- Tiwa, I…

718
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:14,793
I what? You what, Folarin?

719
00:53:16,555 --> 00:53:21,359
Oh my God, this is a bit too much.
Wait, hold a second. So…

720
00:53:23,802 --> 00:53:27,405
If you had a child, at 19,

721
00:53:30,168 --> 00:53:35,332
- that child is probably 21 now.
- Almost 21. Just a few months.

722
00:53:35,492 --> 00:53:37,254
Are you bleeping stupid?!

723
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:42,219
Is this supposed to be
some sort of age contest?

724
00:53:45,622 --> 00:53:48,184
Oh. Hold on.

725
00:53:51,067 --> 00:53:56,232
So that means when we met at camp,

726
00:53:57,313 --> 00:54:00,876
you had just walked away from your family.

727
00:54:01,757 --> 00:54:06,722
You had just walked away from
that woman and your children.

728
00:54:06,922 --> 00:54:10,165
Who are you? What sort of man does that?

729
00:54:13,248 --> 00:54:15,610
Tiwa, please.

730
00:54:18,252 --> 00:54:20,454
Folarin!

731
00:54:20,534 --> 00:54:23,377
Folarin no, no. This is a lie.

732
00:54:23,457 --> 00:54:24,818
No.

733
00:54:25,939 --> 00:54:29,463
- My life is a lie. You are a lie.
- No.

734
00:54:29,663 --> 00:54:32,706
Me, you, us, everything is a lie, Folarin!

735
00:54:38,922 --> 00:54:40,193
Tiwa, please...

736
00:54:40,213 --> 00:54:42,195
Don't touch me! Don't touch me.

737
00:54:43,596 --> 00:54:44,757
- I'm sorry.
- Don't touch me.

738
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:50,682
So why are you telling me this now?

739
00:54:50,763 --> 00:54:51,763
Huh?

740
00:54:51,844 --> 00:54:53,485
Why are you telling me this now?

741
00:54:57,329 --> 00:55:00,211
It's the cleaner. Sista.

742
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:03,254
Her real name is Vicky.

743
00:55:04,655 --> 00:55:06,577
Who?

744
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:10,941
- No way!
- Yes way, Jems!

745
00:55:11,502 --> 00:55:13,584
Yes way. Yes, freaking way.

746
00:55:14,425 --> 00:55:16,907
I don't understand.

747
00:55:17,267 --> 00:55:20,030
I know she told me
that her husband is late.

748
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:24,954
- For like ten years plus now.
- What would you have her say?

749
00:55:25,715 --> 00:55:27,717
Better dead than abandoned.

750
00:55:28,518 --> 00:55:33,122
- Ah, Tiwa, I don't understand this.
- Neither do I.

751
00:55:35,484 --> 00:55:37,686
How are you feeling?

752
00:55:38,927 --> 00:55:41,570
I feel like I've been lied to.

753
00:55:43,772 --> 00:55:47,856
Twelve years, and I married a stranger.

754
00:55:49,217 --> 00:55:52,220
He abandoned his kids, Jems.

755
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:56,023
Like, he didn't look back. He didn't say
anything. He didn't talk about them.

756
00:55:56,143 --> 00:55:59,426
He just boom! Like they never existed.

757
00:56:00,868 --> 00:56:04,551
So, what does he want to do about it now?

758
00:56:04,791 --> 00:56:07,514
What does he want to do
or what do I want to do?

759
00:56:08,475 --> 00:56:10,317
What do you want to do?

760
00:56:11,798 --> 00:56:13,696
He is going to have
a conversation with that woman

761
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,382
and he is going to try to make amends.

762
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:19,926
While we lived in the lap of luxury,

763
00:56:20,416 --> 00:56:27,392
that woman was busy washing toilets to
provide a barely good life for her kids.

764
00:56:28,774 --> 00:56:31,897
Actually she lives slightly above average.

765
00:56:32,177 --> 00:56:34,659
Jems, you cant compare it to what we had.

766
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,701
Or what we have.

767
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:41,746
After he got that offer at Finland,
we've been touring Europe.

768
00:56:42,627 --> 00:56:45,910
Our kids have attended
the best private schools.

769
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:52,686
But she was washing toilets.
Washing toilets.

770
00:56:52,716 --> 00:56:57,040
- Actually, she was washing houses.
- Oh stop, Jems. You know what I mean.

771
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,002
Don't piss me off.

772
00:57:00,043 --> 00:57:03,606
- Sorry.
- What if she was my sister.

773
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:08,130
I saw how she worked
tirelessly cleaning our home.

774
00:57:12,014 --> 00:57:13,215
What if she knows?

775
00:57:15,537 --> 00:57:17,739
Look, that is not the kind of conversation

776
00:57:17,819 --> 00:57:20,011
- I want you to have.
- What do you mean?

777
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:23,545
I mean that, this is not the reaction
I am expecting from you.

778
00:57:23,905 --> 00:57:27,228
- You are supposed to be angry.
- I'm angry. I'm livid!

779
00:57:27,268 --> 00:57:28,990
Then why do you want him to…

780
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:32,132
To what? Take amends? To do right by her?

781
00:57:33,394 --> 00:57:37,838
Jems. I am a secure woman.

782
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,383
And another lady, another girl,
another woman taking FA away from me

783
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:45,815
is the least of my worries.

784
00:57:47,167 --> 00:57:51,650
He committed a grave offense
and I feel responsible.

785
00:57:52,251 --> 00:57:57,616
- Responsible for what?
- Come on, Jems, for everything.

786
00:57:58,697 --> 00:57:59,939
It has nothing to do with you.

787
00:58:00,019 --> 00:58:02,941
It has everything
to do with me. I met FA at camp.

788
00:58:02,981 --> 00:58:05,304
I made him accept the offer.

789
00:58:05,584 --> 00:58:08,707
I first made him apply for it, and then

790
00:58:10,068 --> 00:58:12,030
I insisted that he left with me.

791
00:58:13,551 --> 00:58:15,153
But that is not your fault.

792
00:58:15,873 --> 00:58:20,798
It was his decision to accept the offer.
It was his decision to abandon his family.

793
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:25,843
What you should be thinking now is,
what are you going to tell your children?

794
00:58:26,323 --> 00:58:29,166
And what is she going
to tell her children?

795
00:58:29,286 --> 00:58:31,088
Oh my God.

796
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:36,632
Maybe they already know. She saw him.

797
00:58:41,617 --> 00:58:43,539
I don't think she knows.

798
00:58:43,659 --> 00:58:45,941
She knows.

799
00:58:49,465 --> 00:58:50,946
How are you so sure?

800
00:58:53,789 --> 00:58:55,110
I called her by her name.

801
00:58:57,152 --> 00:58:58,233
Vicky.

802
00:59:00,515 --> 00:59:03,478
She looked at me. Deadpan.

803
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,121
And walked away.

804
00:59:10,845 --> 00:59:12,486
So those are your kids?

805
00:59:19,813 --> 00:59:21,214
Will you forgive me?

806
00:59:25,178 --> 00:59:29,102
Forgiving you
is a different kettle of fish.

807
00:59:31,063 --> 00:59:33,766
Will Vicky forgive you?

808
00:59:40,112 --> 00:59:41,473
Please help.

809
00:59:44,556 --> 00:59:48,039
Folarin Anuoluwa Abrahams.

810
00:59:50,922 --> 00:59:56,046
You are a cold, soul-less man.

811
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:17,146
Aunty Jay, my children's father is dead.

812
01:00:17,667 --> 01:00:20,229
- Sista.
- He is dead.

813
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,631
It's better this way.

814
01:00:23,032 --> 01:00:26,635
Sista… I am a woman.

815
01:00:28,317 --> 01:00:32,150
I totally understand
your plight right now.

816
01:00:32,641 --> 01:00:34,322
I know how hurt you are.

817
01:00:40,288 --> 01:00:43,291
Hurt? Hurt.

818
01:00:44,452 --> 01:00:48,976
This man left me.
He left me eight months pregnant!

819
01:00:50,257 --> 01:00:54,821
He didn't even tell me
anything the night before he left.

820
01:00:56,423 --> 01:00:58,585
He wrote me an ordinary letter.

821
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,616
He wrote me an letter.

822
01:01:01,147 --> 01:01:02,789
One letter.

823
01:01:03,189 --> 01:01:06,352
Then he sent me text message.

824
01:01:07,353 --> 01:01:09,435
Me. Me.

825
01:01:09,555 --> 01:01:12,247
I left school
so that he can finish his education.

826
01:01:13,078 --> 01:01:16,281
Yes. I left school so that
he can finish his education

827
01:01:17,162 --> 01:01:19,925
Yes. Ah, Aunty Jay, I suffered!

828
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:22,287
I suffered!

829
01:01:22,527 --> 01:01:23,768
After he left,

830
01:01:24,689 --> 01:01:26,491
I was pregnant with Anu.

831
01:01:26,971 --> 01:01:28,973
Then the State task force came to my shop,

832
01:01:29,213 --> 01:01:33,938
broke everything, scattered everything,
including what I collected on credit.

833
01:01:35,699 --> 01:01:37,902
University was on strike.

834
01:01:39,543 --> 01:01:42,466
So I didn't have a job. No work.

835
01:01:42,826 --> 01:01:45,388
No money, no food, nothing.

836
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:51,154
Then I started selling
sachet water inside a primary school.

837
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:54,197
And my water was always cold.

838
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:59,221
That's where the headmistress saw me
and asked me to come and clean her house.

839
01:01:59,642 --> 01:02:04,956
Then she referred me to a friend that
in turn referred me to another and so on.

840
01:02:05,007 --> 01:02:08,010
I will go and be cleaning
their houses, until I met you, Aunty Jay.

841
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:09,291
Aunty Jay…

842
01:02:09,691 --> 01:02:13,855
since I met you,
my children have never suffered!

843
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:18,019
Aunty Jay, my children
never suffered since I met you.

844
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:21,582
And so I will continue to work hard!

845
01:02:22,103 --> 01:02:26,627
I will work hard, so that my children
will not serve them like I am serving.

846
01:02:27,107 --> 01:02:30,430
So that when my children
see their dead father, yes,

847
01:02:30,631 --> 01:02:32,953
they will not be below their mates.

848
01:02:33,794 --> 01:02:37,256
Oh yes. And if
they see the other children,

849
01:02:37,677 --> 01:02:39,048
they will not be below them.

850
01:02:39,078 --> 01:02:42,561
Aunty, I'm not
saying anything against you.

851
01:02:43,443 --> 01:02:48,166
No. But… their father is dead!

852
01:02:48,447 --> 01:02:51,890
So I cannot go back to them
and tell them that he has resurrected.

853
01:02:52,051 --> 01:02:56,094
No, I cannot do that. He is dead!

854
01:03:04,462 --> 01:03:06,774
And about the rod…

855
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:10,577
the rod doesn't actually mean cane
or you should beat your children.

856
01:03:10,588 --> 01:03:12,750
- Does Mummy beat you?
- Well…

857
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:16,914
- Well, what? She doesn't beat you.
- But she's always saying she wants to.

858
01:03:17,274 --> 01:03:19,606
Oh, good evening, sir.

859
01:03:19,636 --> 01:03:21,238
I didn't think you'd come.

860
01:03:22,038 --> 01:03:24,030
- You invited him.
- Yes, Mummy.

861
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,268
He said he was going to be around
the area and I just thought maybe...

862
01:03:26,292 --> 01:03:28,565
Anu, go and open the gate.

863
01:03:28,645 --> 01:03:30,816
I'm sure you
and your visitor can talk outside.

864
01:03:30,847 --> 01:03:33,049
- Go on.
- Good evening, sir.

865
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:35,701
Vicky, please.

866
01:03:37,253 --> 01:03:40,135
Anu, open that gate.

867
01:03:41,577 --> 01:03:44,019
Do you know each other?

868
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,781
- Yes.
- No

869
01:03:59,424 --> 01:04:02,596
So, you are our dad?

870
01:04:03,277 --> 01:04:04,878
Father.

871
01:04:05,279 --> 01:04:09,763
There is a difference
between the two. I am your dad.

872
01:04:12,405 --> 01:04:14,007
Please.

873
01:04:14,888 --> 01:04:17,690
Vicky. Please.

874
01:04:18,731 --> 01:04:20,133
Please, what?

875
01:04:21,854 --> 01:04:24,497
Folarin, please, what exactly?

876
01:04:26,018 --> 01:04:30,301
You left me with
an eight months old pregnancy.

877
01:04:30,822 --> 01:04:35,026
And a two-year old baby boy,
without looking back.

878
01:04:36,067 --> 01:04:38,960
You are such a wicked man.

879
01:04:40,712 --> 01:04:43,774
Ah! We are not lost.

880
01:04:44,635 --> 01:04:47,327
Except you're the one who is lost.

881
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,482
Vicky,

882
01:04:51,722 --> 01:04:55,085
you have every right to be angry.

883
01:04:56,406 --> 01:04:57,928
So you can say that, Fola?

884
01:04:58,288 --> 01:05:01,891
You, you want to tell me when I should
be angry and when I should not be angry.

885
01:05:03,052 --> 01:05:05,725
Just listen to the rubbish you are saying!

886
01:05:09,819 --> 01:05:11,821
Why did you leave?

887
01:05:12,181 --> 01:05:14,903
- Did she do something wrong?
- No.

888
01:05:15,984 --> 01:05:18,066
Nothing.

889
01:05:18,947 --> 01:05:21,149
I was 21 years old.

890
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:24,032
I felt choked.

891
01:05:25,233 --> 01:05:27,035
I felt like I was sinking.

892
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:36,604
And so I ran… like a coward.

893
01:05:41,768 --> 01:05:45,201
Did you ever think about us?

894
01:05:46,173 --> 01:05:47,894
Every time.

895
01:05:50,195 --> 01:05:51,738
Rubbish.

896
01:05:52,018 --> 01:05:56,932
But you couldn't be bothered
to come search for us? To come see us?

897
01:05:59,705 --> 01:06:02,388
There's nothing I can…

898
01:06:04,229 --> 01:06:05,951
Fola.

899
01:06:07,272 --> 01:06:09,554
I'm here now.

900
01:06:10,435 --> 01:06:12,877
Please let me make this right.

901
01:06:13,638 --> 01:06:16,120
Let me make it up to you.

902
01:06:17,762 --> 01:06:19,283
All of you.

903
01:06:32,976 --> 01:06:34,618
You are not my husband.

904
01:06:35,418 --> 01:06:37,060
I am not your wife.

905
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:43,635
These ones, they are
your children. It is up to them.

906
01:06:44,147 --> 01:06:48,070
Let them decide. Alright.

907
01:10:24,392 --> 01:10:27,595
- Sista!
- Eh?

908
01:10:27,675 --> 01:10:29,757
- Sista!
- Yes?

909
01:10:30,277 --> 01:10:33,200
Mummy, guess what? Guess what?

910
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,463
- Folarin bought you something else.
- No!

911
01:10:36,553 --> 01:10:41,167
Mummy, I just got admission
into SSP Academy.

912
01:10:41,688 --> 01:10:46,612
See, see, see! Mummy, take it.
Open it, Mummy. Oh!

913
01:10:47,253 --> 01:10:52,107
- What happened to your admission now?
- Nothing, nothing.

914
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:54,660
Dad wants us to school in Europe.

915
01:10:55,821 --> 01:11:00,585
So I have to do some exams.
A-levels, and some exams, anyway.

916
01:11:01,146 --> 01:11:04,309
Mummy, he is also transferring Fola
to another private university.

917
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:08,793
Call me, Fola.
Go and call me your brother.

918
01:11:09,233 --> 01:11:12,027
Fola!

919
01:11:13,838 --> 01:11:17,041
- Fola, what happened to your admission?
- Nothing.

920
01:11:17,161 --> 01:11:21,845
Really? Nothing?
So why do you want to change admission?

921
01:11:22,406 --> 01:11:24,608
Mummy, you know that
there are a lot of strikes.

922
01:11:24,808 --> 01:11:26,800
And besides Dad want me
to finish in record time

923
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,343
so that when he's relocating to Europe,
I can follow him back to do my masters.

924
01:11:30,383 --> 01:11:34,306
- Oh.
- Mummy, we are going together.

925
01:11:34,337 --> 01:11:37,380
Good. When are you people going?

926
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:41,864
- Not for another year.
- Another year? That's too long.

927
01:11:44,786 --> 01:11:46,588
You people should go now.

928
01:11:48,029 --> 01:11:51,793
- Sista?
- Hey! You people should go now!

929
01:11:52,233 --> 01:11:54,655
Folarin should come
and get you out of here!

930
01:11:54,716 --> 01:11:57,638
- Folarin should come and just take you!
- Sista!

931
01:11:57,668 --> 01:11:59,800
- If you utter another word!
- Mummy?

932
01:12:01,522 --> 01:12:05,586
Go to your father's house.
Both of you, go to your father's house!

933
01:12:05,646 --> 01:12:07,167
You will hear from me!

934
01:12:07,247 --> 01:12:09,369
Folarin will hear from me!

935
01:12:11,812 --> 01:12:15,304
Folarin, you cannot
take my children away from me.

936
01:12:15,575 --> 01:12:17,297
You cannot!

937
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:19,659
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

938
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:23,062
You cannot come and
bamboozle my children with money!

939
01:12:23,262 --> 01:12:26,885
No! Eh, you can not do that. We are okay.

940
01:12:26,906 --> 01:12:29,868
I accept you only because
my children accept you.

941
01:12:30,109 --> 01:12:34,362
But all these buying
of iPhone, spending lavishly…

942
01:12:34,412 --> 01:12:35,914
It has to stop.

943
01:12:36,234 --> 01:12:39,117
Sista, please calm down. Please.

944
01:12:39,357 --> 01:12:42,259
Aunty ma, help me and beg him.

945
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:47,285
Tell him to stop! Was he there
when Anu took her first step?

946
01:12:47,365 --> 01:12:48,496
It was all me.

947
01:12:48,686 --> 01:12:52,289
Was he there
when Anu almost died of jaundice?

948
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:55,092
Or when Fola fell
from a two-storey building?

949
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:57,934
Was he there? It was all still me.

950
01:12:58,175 --> 01:13:03,780
I even lied to my children that
their father died just to protect them.

951
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:06,703
So that they will not think
that he abandoned them.

952
01:13:07,143 --> 01:13:08,144
Warn him!

953
01:13:08,344 --> 01:13:12,357
Because now, you want to come and
take my children away from me suddenly.

954
01:13:12,368 --> 01:13:14,550
I won't have it. Never!

955
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:17,853
I'm not trying to take the children away.
I'm trying to be their father.

956
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:19,795
Well, then be their dad from here!

957
01:13:20,035 --> 01:13:21,356
It shouldn't go beyond here!

958
01:13:21,637 --> 01:13:23,919
Fola, it shouldn't go beyond here.

959
01:13:24,119 --> 01:13:25,440
Nothing is wrong with them.

960
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:27,822
Don't fix anything
that is not spoilt in my children!

961
01:13:27,842 --> 01:13:30,621
Nothing is wrong with their school!
Nothing is wrong with their clothes!

962
01:13:30,645 --> 01:13:34,048
Nothing wrong with their phone!
I am telling you.

963
01:13:34,168 --> 01:13:36,530
Leave my children alone!

964
01:13:36,931 --> 01:13:38,952
You didn't talk to her about all these?

965
01:13:39,053 --> 01:13:41,415
- Well, she said she didn't want...
- No!

966
01:13:42,056 --> 01:13:47,180
My children, Fola…
I repeat, my children go nowhere!

967
01:13:48,021 --> 01:13:52,225
Ahn-ahn. One letter, is
what you wrote for me.

968
01:13:52,705 --> 01:13:55,228
Fola, you wrote me only a letter.

969
01:13:55,788 --> 01:13:59,432
I thought we don't fit
into your future plan?

970
01:13:59,992 --> 01:14:04,196
So now my children look
like they fit your plan, right?

971
01:14:04,717 --> 01:14:05,948
I won't have it.

972
01:14:06,038 --> 01:14:08,530
What did I say? I won't have it.

973
01:14:10,282 --> 01:14:11,603
- Vicky?
- Hmm?

974
01:14:11,923 --> 01:14:15,327
They are my children too and
you cannot stop me from seeing them.

975
01:14:20,571 --> 01:14:22,149
You want to see madness unleashed, right?

976
01:14:22,173 --> 01:14:23,414
Fola, you will see…

977
01:14:27,017 --> 01:14:29,340
First, I'll take off my wig and curse you.

978
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:32,943
First, I'll take off my wig and curse you.

979
01:14:35,665 --> 01:14:36,867
Be careful.

980
01:14:38,028 --> 01:14:41,511
What did I just say? Be careful.

981
01:14:43,913 --> 01:14:45,114
Try it.

982
01:14:46,756 --> 01:14:50,088
Oh yes. You people should go to him!

983
01:14:50,119 --> 01:14:53,442
Since I don't know
how to do it anymore. Well, so go!

984
01:14:53,842 --> 01:14:54,963
- Mummy…
- Hmm.

985
01:14:55,043 --> 01:14:57,886
That man is just trying
to help. Why are refusing him?

986
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:02,771
I don't need his money.
I don't need his money!

987
01:15:04,092 --> 01:15:07,204
And I'm not cheap like you children. Yes.

988
01:15:07,255 --> 01:15:09,376
Because if you children considered

989
01:15:09,387 --> 01:15:12,300
all the things I went through
to raise you without a father figure…

990
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,508
It's not like he was dead,
he just left you people.

991
01:15:14,532 --> 01:15:16,704
You will not just
accept him, just like that.

992
01:15:17,064 --> 01:15:21,928
- Mummy, but you taught us to forgive.
- Oh sorry, Minister Anu.

993
01:15:21,949 --> 01:15:24,511
And have I said now,
that you should not forgive him?

994
01:15:24,671 --> 01:15:27,233
Have I said that? Hmm?

995
01:15:27,674 --> 01:15:30,557
Mummy, you really need to chill.

996
01:15:31,237 --> 01:15:34,730
Yes, what he did was bad.
But let that man do right by his kids.

997
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,802
That way you don't have to work so much.

998
01:15:37,043 --> 01:15:39,565
You are younger than him,
yet you look much older.

999
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:43,869
Please Mummy,
let this man carry your burden.

1000
01:15:51,696 --> 01:15:55,780
Okay. No problem.

1001
01:16:03,747 --> 01:16:05,990
I have never seen her this angry before.

1002
01:16:12,956 --> 01:16:15,518
She has every right to be.

1003
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,323
Even if she takes it a tad bit too far.

1004
01:16:26,809 --> 01:16:30,612
Look, I don't want
to get between you guys.

1005
01:16:34,016 --> 01:16:36,378
She doesn't speak to us anymore.

1006
01:16:36,618 --> 01:16:40,061
She just goes for
her cleaning job and she comes back late.

1007
01:16:48,469 --> 01:16:50,351
What do you think I should do?

1008
01:17:00,881 --> 01:17:05,484
Her reason is valid. And you need
to see this from her perspective.

1009
01:17:06,806 --> 01:17:09,008
- I am.
- No, you're not.

1010
01:17:09,328 --> 01:17:12,011
You're being selfish.

1011
01:17:12,612 --> 01:17:14,373
How?

1012
01:17:14,533 --> 01:17:16,215
How?

1013
01:17:16,455 --> 01:17:18,897
Really? You're asking how?

1014
01:17:25,263 --> 01:17:26,785
Have you…

1015
01:17:27,786 --> 01:17:30,888
asked me how I feel about all this?

1016
01:17:37,234 --> 01:17:39,697
I… I thought…

1017
01:17:39,797 --> 01:17:43,080
Oh you thought. You thought.

1018
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,462
You thought I was okay with it?

1019
01:17:47,444 --> 01:17:52,809
So it didn't occur to you to discuss me,

1020
01:17:53,249 --> 01:17:54,891
your wife,

1021
01:17:55,251 --> 01:17:59,735
whom out of the blues, you just spring it
up on me that you've got another family.

1022
01:18:03,018 --> 01:18:05,938
Have you thought about how we are
going to break the news to our children?

1023
01:18:08,143 --> 01:18:09,574
How we're going to tell them,

1024
01:18:09,604 --> 01:18:13,869
"Oh lyin, Feranmi, guess what. You've got
a big brother and a big sister!"

1025
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:21,585
Have you thought about
what goes through my mind

1026
01:18:21,756 --> 01:18:28,282
when I think of that moment
when you walked out on your children?

1027
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,768
I swept my feelings

1028
01:18:36,169 --> 01:18:40,323
under the carpet,
just so you can have peace.

1029
01:18:41,254 --> 01:18:45,618
And also because
I felt really sorry for Sista.

1030
01:18:46,259 --> 01:18:51,173
But you, Folarin… you didn't think,

1031
01:18:52,665 --> 01:18:57,519
ask, inquire. Nothing.

1032
01:18:57,589 --> 01:19:01,292
You just didn't care. You just
thought I was okay with it.

1033
01:19:01,353 --> 01:19:03,985
Throwing two children
at me, just like that.

1034
01:19:04,025 --> 01:19:07,639
And boom!
Because she accepts, she's okay with it!

1035
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:13,493
The same way you assume that
that Sista and her children need saving!

1036
01:19:18,369 --> 01:19:21,011
If you want to be a good dad,

1037
01:19:22,813 --> 01:19:26,736
if you want to make up for lost time,

1038
01:19:28,858 --> 01:19:31,530
then get to know your children.

1039
01:19:35,064 --> 01:19:37,306
Folarin…

1040
01:19:39,148 --> 01:19:42,671
I support you because I love you.

1041
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:52,641
But I realize now,
you don't think about anyone else

1042
01:19:53,081 --> 01:19:54,843
but yourself.

1043
01:19:57,285 --> 01:20:01,138
Same way you didn't think
about the implication

1044
01:20:01,729 --> 01:20:04,992
of walking away from your children

1045
01:20:05,773 --> 01:20:09,056
that morning you left for camp.

1046
01:21:02,305 --> 01:21:07,390
That night, I decided
to get away from it all.

1047
01:21:09,832 --> 01:21:12,155
I wrote that letter.

1048
01:21:15,598 --> 01:21:20,091
Then I got to camp and I met you.

1049
01:21:22,804 --> 01:21:29,620
I just felt like I was
given a chance for a do over.

1050
01:21:30,412 --> 01:21:32,253
You became my reality.

1051
01:21:33,494 --> 01:21:37,858
Vicky and the kids were like a dream.

1052
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:41,302
But they are real.

1053
01:21:46,506 --> 01:21:48,199
Tiwa.

1054
01:21:49,469 --> 01:21:53,282
I love you, very much.

1055
01:21:54,434 --> 01:21:57,156
I thank you for being so amazing.

1056
01:21:58,037 --> 01:22:00,920
I am grateful that I've always
been surrounded by strong women.

1057
01:22:02,041 --> 01:22:05,204
You and Vicky.

1058
01:22:06,645 --> 01:22:12,010
Vicky is my past. You are my present.

1059
01:22:13,331 --> 01:22:16,935
Our children, that's our future.

1060
01:22:19,617 --> 01:22:21,539
I need to fix this.

1061
01:22:23,501 --> 01:22:25,182
I need you.

1062
01:22:25,703 --> 01:22:30,016
I need to know
that you're okay with my past.

1063
01:22:31,348 --> 01:22:35,032
With them being in my life, in our lives.

1064
01:22:37,914 --> 01:22:39,876
I can't do this without you.

1065
01:22:45,041 --> 01:22:48,075
I love you, Folarin.

1066
01:23:04,339 --> 01:23:05,980
I love you too.

1067
01:23:14,028 --> 01:23:15,509
Sista.

1068
01:23:16,110 --> 01:23:19,193
You know
that children are easily excitable.

1069
01:23:19,313 --> 01:23:22,556
They get excited
by little, little things, eh?

1070
01:23:23,477 --> 01:23:26,880
But your children, they miss you so much.

1071
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,652
They really, really miss you.

1072
01:23:31,684 --> 01:23:33,926
He left us.

1073
01:23:35,208 --> 01:23:38,251
He erased us from his memory.

1074
01:23:40,953 --> 01:23:42,364
He forgot about me.

1075
01:23:43,575 --> 01:23:45,617
He forgot about his two children.

1076
01:23:49,461 --> 01:23:53,814
If I had not gone to their house to work,
do you think he would have remembered me?

1077
01:23:54,746 --> 01:23:57,629
Or you think
he'd have looked for those children?

1078
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:03,394
You see?

1079
01:24:05,716 --> 01:24:08,599
No, think about it.

1080
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:10,200
Hmm?

1081
01:24:10,721 --> 01:24:11,842
You did not consider that?

1082
01:24:13,243 --> 01:24:16,086
So, if not that…

1083
01:24:17,807 --> 01:24:21,531
So you children
just accept him without thinking.

1084
01:24:22,612 --> 01:24:28,137
If he did not see me, or if not
that he see us in that party,

1085
01:24:28,778 --> 01:24:31,420
will he look for you? Hmm?

1086
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:35,633
- But he said he did.
- Where?

1087
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:37,826
I'm asking you, where?

1088
01:24:39,387 --> 01:24:41,029
Just one letter.

1089
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:44,131
Just one letter!

1090
01:24:44,272 --> 01:24:45,393
That's all he wrote to me.

1091
01:24:46,474 --> 01:24:49,036
I showed you children the letter, right?

1092
01:24:49,237 --> 01:24:51,158
You read it, didn't you?

1093
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:54,171
I'm asking, didn't you read it?

1094
01:24:55,963 --> 01:24:59,376
I still talk with lya Afusat,
our landlord at that time.

1095
01:24:59,967 --> 01:25:02,709
If he wrote me
another letter, I'd have known.

1096
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:06,052
He did not look for me.

1097
01:25:07,293 --> 01:25:08,815
But look at you children.

1098
01:25:10,616 --> 01:25:12,768
After all I suffered because of you.

1099
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:16,822
After all my hustling.

1100
01:25:18,143 --> 01:25:20,495
After all the stress
I went through because of you.

1101
01:25:20,826 --> 01:25:21,987
I won't cry.

1102
01:25:22,588 --> 01:25:23,869
No problem.

1103
01:25:24,309 --> 01:25:28,273
You know nothing of what I've
suffered because of you. You have no idea.

1104
01:25:30,343 --> 01:25:31,616
Why do you…

1105
01:25:31,636 --> 01:25:35,589
Why do you children think
that I told you he was dead? Why?

1106
01:25:38,442 --> 01:25:43,196
I don't want you
to think he's a bad person. But now,

1107
01:25:43,487 --> 01:25:47,651
you children make me look like I am the
bad person. Is that not so?

1108
01:25:49,973 --> 01:25:52,495
Sista.

1109
01:25:53,897 --> 01:25:55,298
Mummy.

1110
01:25:56,419 --> 01:25:59,362
I don't think you are the problem.

1111
01:26:00,423 --> 01:26:04,106
I am sorry if I
ever made you feel like the problem.

1112
01:26:04,827 --> 01:26:06,850
Please forgive me.

1113
01:26:10,512 --> 01:26:14,596
Sista, you know you are my everything.

1114
01:26:15,877 --> 01:26:18,319
I'm sorry I got carried away.

1115
01:26:19,401 --> 01:26:22,994
I just imagined what my dad
would be like had he not died.

1116
01:26:23,644 --> 01:26:27,428
And when I met him,
he was everything I imagined.

1117
01:26:28,898 --> 01:26:31,491
I didn't stop to think about your pain.

1118
01:26:33,674 --> 01:26:37,738
Mummy, please forgive me. I'm sorry.

1119
01:26:39,419 --> 01:26:41,861
Come here.

1120
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:52,591
Are you ready?

1121
01:26:55,274 --> 01:26:56,675
I guess.

1122
01:27:16,974 --> 01:27:19,516
- Good afternoon, sir.
- How are you?

1123
01:27:19,737 --> 01:27:23,820
Fola, who's there? Why are you outside?

1124
01:27:24,461 --> 01:27:26,743
I'd like to have a word with your mother.

1125
01:27:27,184 --> 01:27:30,907
Fola. What are you doing outside?

1126
01:27:39,355 --> 01:27:43,959
To be honest… I don't think I would have.

1127
01:27:46,361 --> 01:27:49,444
I was too big a coward and…

1128
01:27:50,525 --> 01:27:55,090
I couldn't bear
the consequences of my actions.

1129
01:27:59,654 --> 01:28:04,918
I… I used to think to myself,
"What would I say?

1130
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:10,584
How would she react?"

1131
01:28:14,788 --> 01:28:18,071
I couldn't even bear
the thought of looking at you?

1132
01:28:20,353 --> 01:28:24,397
That's the honest truth.
Then fate brought us together.

1133
01:28:25,198 --> 01:28:28,321
And I tried to seize the opportunity.

1134
01:28:33,405 --> 01:28:37,409
You are an amazing woman and mother.

1135
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:43,134
You selflessly
raised these kids, all alone.

1136
01:28:46,457 --> 01:28:48,379
But I'm here now.

1137
01:28:50,821 --> 01:28:55,025
It will be an honor,
if you'll let me help.

1138
01:28:58,268 --> 01:28:59,870
Let me help you

1139
01:29:00,510 --> 01:29:04,394
give them the kind of life
that I'm sure that you want them to have.

1140
01:29:05,555 --> 01:29:07,397
And…

1141
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:13,062
I would love to be a father

1142
01:29:13,603 --> 01:29:19,478
to Folarin and Anuoluwa…
the way that I should.

1143
01:29:22,131 --> 01:29:25,173
I went about it the wrong way.

1144
01:29:25,654 --> 01:29:29,377
I was excited and eager.

1145
01:29:30,739 --> 01:29:35,543
I got caught up in the euphoria,
and I'm sorry that I hurt you.

1146
01:29:40,227 --> 01:29:44,071
And my wife. I'm sorry.

1147
01:29:52,919 --> 01:29:58,124
I'm grateful for everything
you ever did for me.

1148
01:29:59,766 --> 01:30:04,139
So even if it's not for the kids, please

1149
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:09,775
allow me show my appreciation
for putting me through school.

1150
01:30:13,699 --> 01:30:15,100
Yes, kids.

1151
01:30:16,541 --> 01:30:22,387
Your mom here saw me through school
making the "baddest" noodles in Ife.

1152
01:30:34,198 --> 01:30:35,759
My sister…

1153
01:30:40,674 --> 01:30:42,095
Please.

1154
01:30:45,849 --> 01:30:48,211
Please.

1155
01:31:28,889 --> 01:31:30,490
Hello?

1156
01:31:33,052 --> 01:31:34,854
Yes, yes.

1157
01:31:35,295 --> 01:31:39,448
Ah, the car is here.
We are just waiting for Fola now.

1158
01:31:39,538 --> 01:31:42,631
Fola has checked us in, yes.

1159
01:31:43,903 --> 01:31:46,545
Is, erm, only something…

1160
01:31:46,625 --> 01:31:50,308
Something about a baggage dropping.

1161
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:52,911
Baggage drop. It's your daddy.

1162
01:31:54,312 --> 01:31:57,395
Oh yeah, yeah um…

1163
01:31:57,675 --> 01:32:00,918
Yeah, yeah.

1164
01:32:01,639 --> 01:32:05,202
It's your daddy. Yeah, okay.

1165
01:32:07,925 --> 01:32:12,249
He said he will wait for us
in Schipol. Which area is that?

1166
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:15,201
- Sista.
- Hmm?

1167
01:32:15,252 --> 01:32:17,174
That's the airport.

1168
01:32:17,414 --> 01:32:19,095
Lock the door and give me the key.

1169
01:32:20,457 --> 01:32:22,168
Is the key in your bag?

1170
01:32:22,418 --> 01:32:24,020
Alright, alright.

1171
01:32:27,984 --> 01:32:30,776
Hmm! Catch up with us, Fola.

1172
01:32:30,846 --> 01:32:33,829
Hello, Uncle.

1173
01:32:35,751 --> 01:32:38,393
Go and get in through that side!

1174
01:32:38,473 --> 01:32:40,355
Doing this…

1175
01:32:41,076 --> 01:32:43,238
Quickly.

1176
01:32:43,318 --> 01:32:45,320
Fola, did you lock the back door?
