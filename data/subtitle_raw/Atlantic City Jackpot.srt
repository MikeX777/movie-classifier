MAN [ON RADIO]:
Hi, I'm a loafer.

2
00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:07,659
I don't like to work at all.

3
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:09,574
I'd much rather loaf than work.

4
00:00:09,618 --> 00:00:11,620
Wouldn't you?

5
00:00:11,663 --> 00:00:14,405
I like to fool away
the time, goof off, put

6
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,581
my feet up, and take it easy.

7
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,062
It's my time, isn't it?

8
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:21,717
And I waste it if I want.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,068
Now, the reason I lie in bed
till noon is I'm a rich man.

10
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:28,593
You may wonder how a loafer
like me got to be rich.

11
00:00:28,637 --> 00:00:30,595
Well, I didn't inherit money.

12
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:32,249
My father was a
small town preacher.

13
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:35,731
He never made much and
gave away what he did make.

14
00:00:35,774 --> 00:00:37,646
I don't gamble,
and I don't steal,

15
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:39,909
and I didn't marry
any rich girl.

16
00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:42,085
But I found a way to work
just a few hours a day

17
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:43,695
and make a fortune.

18
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,742
You could too, buy
sending me $5.98

19
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:49,658
for my book, "The Poor
Man's Guide to Easy

20
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:52,530
Living and Instant Wealth."

21
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:54,402
By following the
principles of my book,

22
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:56,230
you could be sitting
right now by the pool

23
00:00:56,273 --> 00:00:58,232
of some fancy hotel.

24
00:00:58,275 --> 00:00:59,624
You could put
steak on your table

25
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:01,322
instead of pork and beans.

26
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:04,020
You could have the things you
want, do the things you want

27
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,632
to do, travel, live it up,
drive a Cadillac convertible,

28
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:11,071
or if you're like me, maybe you
just want to sit back, relax,

29
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:13,073
and watch the grass grow.

30
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:14,596
You can do it.

31
00:01:14,639 --> 00:01:18,165
Send me $5.98 today care
of this radio station.

32
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:21,516
It'll be the best investment you
ever make, better than stocks

33
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:23,779
and bonds, better than
watching that old devil

34
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:26,782
inflation eat away at the
money in your project.

35
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:30,220
And if you're not satisfied,
if you don't learn how to live

36
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:33,702
easy and make money fast, I'll
be glad to send you your money

37
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:34,659
back.

38
00:01:34,703 --> 00:01:36,270
But keep the book anyway.

39
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:37,445
I can afford it.

40
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:40,056
It only cost me
$0.20 to print up.

41
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,320
But it's worth thousands,
maybe millions.

42
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:46,062
You and your family
will thank me for it.

43
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:57,465

47
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:04,042
Hi, Elaine, uh,
get me 758-2610.

48
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:05,348
Oh, come on, Elaine.

49
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:07,350
Just-- just get me
the number, will you?

50
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:09,134
That ain't your job
collecting the bills.

51
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:13,487
All right, I got the message.

52
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:23,584
Now can I-- can I
just have 758-2610?

53
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:32,419
Now can I-- can I
just have 758-2610?

54
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:35,160
Hello, how are you?

55
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:38,990
This is 322.

56
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:40,775
What do you need my name for?

57
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:41,602
I just give you my number.

58
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:42,777
They'll call me back.

59
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,170
[radio]

60
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,137
Now, wait a minute.

61
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,574
If your new, then they
should tell you how it works.

62
00:05:57,618 --> 00:05:58,923
I phone in.

63
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:01,361
I give my number, and
they call me back.

64
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:03,275
No, I'm not going to
give you my name, man.

65
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,538
That's not how this
game is played.

66
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:13,938
Yeah, now, wait a minute, man.

67
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:15,418
Now, look.

68
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:16,811
You're, uh-- you're
talking a little too much.

69
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:18,029
You're beginning to make
me nervous, you know?

70
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:24,601
[knocking]

71
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:26,516
Roland?

72
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,301
I'm getting off
this phone right now.

74
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:33,610
Roland, are you there?

75
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:34,481
Wake up.

76
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:39,486
Roland?

77
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:43,620
Hey, nursie, want to
take my temperature?

78
00:06:43,664 --> 00:06:44,795
LUCY: I'm sorry.

79
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,144
I'm trying to wake
up my boyfriend.

80
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:47,668
Roland?

81
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:48,408
MAN: Will you come down here
and take my temperature?

82
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,452
Yes, I'm sure.

83
00:06:49,496 --> 00:06:52,412
Roland, will you open this door?

84
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:55,545
OK, OK, OK, I'm coming.

00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:56,372

86
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,375
I'm coming

87
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,379
Roland, there's a man out here.

88
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,249
Oh, thank goodness.

89
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:05,381
Hey, what's the matter?

90
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,600
That old wino bothering you?

91
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:07,644
Roland.

92
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:08,732
Why didn't you answer the door?

93
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:09,777
I was knocking for hours.

94
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,387
I was asleep.

95
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,170
Come on in.

96
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:13,607
What a creepy guy.

97
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,087
Nah, he's a good guy.

98

100
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:43,158
I got the check, Mr. Banks.

101
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:44,855
I'm sorry I couldn't
do more for you,

102
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:47,162
but it's a difficult time
of year to sell a boat.

103
00:07:47,205 --> 00:07:49,686
I can tell you.

104
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,557
35 grand?

105
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,866
I have almost twice
that in it, Bill.

106
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,955
I know, easy.

107
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,783
I think figured you'd
get at least 42.

108
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:02,569
Yeah.

109
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:07,095
Well, I better get
this to the bank.

110
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:08,836
Send you a commission when I
get back the office, OK, Bill?

111
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,533
No problem.

112
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:12,274
Oh, Mr. Banks?

113
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:18,454
Do you see this little runabout
we got in-- real little beauty.

114
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,979
You trying to talk this
check out of me, Bill?

115
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,680
Thanks.

116
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:29,596
Isn't that the one with the
house up on the heights?

117
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,771
Didn't I pick you up there once?

118
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:31,815
LUCY: Yes.

119
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:33,382
She has this fabulous kitchen.

120
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:34,514
Do you like meatloaf?

121
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:37,473
Uh, yeah, yeah, it's OK.

122
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,562
I make this incredible
meatloaf, Roland.

123
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:40,781
Oh.

124
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:42,260
I do.

Oh, Roland, you're
messing my uniform.

00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:53,707

going to kill me.

MAN [ON RADIO]: You
young people see

131
00:08:57,275 --> 00:09:01,366
the world different from most
of us old timers, don't you?

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,499
You see everyone out
working and struggling,

any meaning in it.

a small town preacher.

And he couldn't understand me.

139
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:17,861
All I wanted to do was sit
back and watch the grass grow.

140

He'd say, Bob,
you can't do that.

141
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:22,300
Well, I did.

142
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:23,954

Yeah, yeah, I'm
going over there now.

155
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:55,725
Should be no problem at all.

You just tell me what to do
once I get in there, huh?

157
00:09:56,857 --> 00:09:58,162
It's so cold in here.

158

I owe you, look,

161
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:11,698
I should be able to clear it
in a couple of weeks, huh?

162
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:13,090
So call off your army, huh, man?

163
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:27,975
OK.

164
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:29,150
That's it.

165
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:30,194
Give them out.

Times are rough.

00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:36,505
See you all later.

171
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:37,419
Wait a minute, Rich.

172
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:38,768
What about the bank?

173
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:39,813
One thing at a time, Phil.

174
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:44,208
God dammit, one thing at a time.

175
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:45,819
All right, you might
as well give those out.

starting to bug me.

182

I guess so.
Look, I'll try.

183
00:11:22,203 --> 00:11:23,030
Don't forget.

You know where it is?
-Yeah, yeah, thanks.

00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:27,643
I picked you up there once.
Remember?

187
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,644
OK, bye.

Hey, I wouldn't let
you down, Freddie.

00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:59,343
Hey, I heard things are
really busy around here.

203
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:00,605
I'm kind of looking
around, you know?

Come here a minute.
-Who's that?

207
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:06,916
Who's Steve?
Do I know him?

208
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,917
No, no, no, he's from Miami.

209
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:12,443
What's up, Freddie?

210
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:14,271
Uh, this is Roland.

211
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:15,098
He's a friend of mine.

212
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:15,882
He's a real operator.

213
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:19,320
But I like him.

214
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:20,625
Roland, this is Steve.

215
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:22,497
Roland.

216
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,891
Uh, how are you doing?

217
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:27,850
Yeah.

218
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:29,809
Uh, Roland, here,
is looking for a job.

219
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,767
He's been around a long time.

220
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,204
Talk to him, Roland.

221
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:37,904
Ah, shit, I ran my
first pool when I was 15.

222
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:38,861
No kidding?

223
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:40,254
That's too bad.

224
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:42,865
See, I don't need
anybody to run this pool.

225
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:45,259
I run the pool.

What about my money?

What about my money?

231
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,966
I had to sell my damned
boat, for Christ's sake.

232

Your boat, your boat--
who cares about your boat?

I've got over a half
million dollars in there,

Hey, take it easy.

I said maybe foreclosed.

237
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,546
The bank's just making noises.

238
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:13,026
I can shut them up.

He said talk to you.

Listen, Ellen,
with, I don't know,

243
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,645
maybe a few hundred thousand
I can stall them off until we

244

start renting.

245
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,866

have that much left.

if you lose that?

247
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:31,305
I don't want to talk about it.

00:14:31,348 --> 00:14:32,349
Hey, listen to me.

249
00:14:32,393 --> 00:14:34,003
We're in trouble here, dammit.

250
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:35,787
You have to talk about it.

251
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:37,789
You want to throw away the money
you put in the building so far?

252
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,574
I don't think so.

253
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:41,532
I don't know how
to be poor, Richard.

254
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:43,491
I haven't had any practice.

255
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:47,408
Ellen, you were born
too rich to ever be poor.

256
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:51,847
All right, I'm not
going to beg you.

00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,936
Shit, I can't find Jeremy.

258
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,156
I can see her, but
I can't see him.

259
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,114
I told you to watch them.

261
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:06,862
Hey, he's OK.

262
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,603
He just got knocked
down by a wave.

263
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:09,604
He's OK.

264
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:10,300
Hey.

265
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:17,568
Jeremy, you're all right.

266
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:19,570
Roland.

267
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:23,487

Yeah.

271
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:30,712
Hey, I'm no porter, man.

272
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:32,105

Well, I mean all I
got to do is walk along

clear a grand a week, easy.

dealing dope here.

Haven't you ever
thought of that?

290
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:07,270
I mean, you could be running
girls in and out of here, man.

291
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:09,490

chance, and you and I

I don't want your dirty money.

296

I don't mean real dope, man.

297
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:21,197
I mean grass and
coke, like that.

298
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:22,198
Come on.

299
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:23,025
Let me throw a few numbers.

00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:24,331

rub some oil on Mrs.

There's going to
be a slight delay.

320
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:46,500
We had a little accident,
and he went to his department

321
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:47,457
to change clothes.

322
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:49,720
But he'll be in soon.

323
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:52,201
Oh, no, no, it's
nothing serious.

324
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:57,119
Um, Marie would you leave a
message for Richard, please?

325
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:58,120
Yeah.

326
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:01,776
Just tell him I'm sorry, but no.

327
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:02,559
That's right.

328
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:06,215
I'm sorry, but no.

329
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,173
Oh, they're fine.

330
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:10,393

Oh, hi, honey.

00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:17,487
Uh, yeah, I have to talk
to Mommy for a few minutes.

333
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:20,534
Sure, I'll talk to you after.

334
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:22,318
Yeah, right now I have
to talk to Mommy, just

335
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:23,145
for a few minutes.

336
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:24,015
Would you get her?

337
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:36,898
Uh, honey, would you
tell her that it's

338
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:39,074
really, really important.

339
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,295
I must talk to her right now.

340
00:18:42,338 --> 00:18:43,339
OK?

341
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:44,079
Go ahead.

342
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:58,485
Honey, tell Mom-- uh,
just tell her to call

343
00:18:58,528 --> 00:19:02,053
me as soon as she can, OK?

344
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:05,622
Sure.

345
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,362
What do you want to talk about?

346
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:11,802
No, I don't think it
was funny when Jeremy

347
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:13,978
got lost in the water, honey.

348
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:17,417
It's never funny when
someone could get hurt.

349
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,289
You know that.

350
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,725
That's right.

351
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:24,467
Let's protect little
children and keep

352
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:27,514
them from getting hurt.

353
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:29,298
I agree.

354
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:31,257
Right.

358
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:00,808
[hanging up phone]

359
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:01,896
Where the hell is Phil?

360
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:03,376
I don't know!

361
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:04,768
I mean, where-- maybe
he's over at the building.

362
00:20:04,812 --> 00:20:06,161
Well, would you give
him a call and tell

363
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,423
him I'll pick him up, huh?

364
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:09,033
And get rid of these
damned magazines.

365
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:12,602
It looks like a goddamned
dentist's office in here.

366
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,573
MAN [ON INTERCOM]:
Ladies and gentlemen,

367
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:39,107
--you will see this [inaudible]
before your eyes very slowly

368
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:43,111
growing to a length of
six to eight inches--

369
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:47,550
the long, straggling
hair of a gorilla or ape.

370
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:50,074
It will continue to
grow down the neck,

371
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:54,557
over her breasts, both breasts,
and down the body itself,

372
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:58,518
changing this beautiful
girl before your eyes

373
00:20:58,561 --> 00:21:03,523
into a horrible,
ugly, male, gorilla.

374
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:06,003
Anything can happen.

375
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:10,486
But you're safe in there,
because Dr. Edison have

376
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,967
her under complete control.

377
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:16,449
But if you've got a weak
heart, then don't go here.

378
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:20,975
Young ladies in the family
way, you're not invited.

379
00:21:21,018 --> 00:21:24,935
This show is not for the timid.

380
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:30,376
I mean, we're going to scare
the hell right out of you.

381
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:33,379
This is the same
[inaudible] Princess

382
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:35,903
Uraina, the gorilla girl.

383
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:38,340
Was Darwin right?

384
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:41,343
Did man come from ape?

385
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:43,867
You're going to see
a beautiful girl

386
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:47,349
locked in a solid steel cage.

387
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:51,353
You're going to see her
change before your eyes.

388
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:56,793
Very slowly she'll change
into an ugly, male gorilla--

389
00:21:56,837 --> 00:22:02,799
a gorilla so strong that
it can bend a steel bar.

390
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:06,281
From the top of her head
to the tips of her toes,

391
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,762
you'll see the hair grow.

392
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:12,287
The ape girl, the
ape girl, the ape

393
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,725
girl-- she's alive,
so much alive

394
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:18,728
that only the brave are invited.

395
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:25,213
Princess Uraina, the gorilla
girl-- anything can happen.

396
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:29,696
But you're safe in there,
because Dr. Edison will have

397
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:31,654
her under complete control.

398
00:22:31,698 --> 00:22:35,658
But if you've got a weak
heart, then don't go here.

399
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:39,619
Young ladies in the family
way, you're not invited.

400
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:43,144
This show is not for the timid.

401
00:22:43,187 --> 00:22:45,146
Was Darwin right?

402
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:47,496
Did man come from ape?

403
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:09,431
OK, where are we off to?

404
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:11,302
Someplace profitable, I assume.

405
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:13,740
We're going to see the friend
of a local businessmen, Phil.

406
00:23:13,783 --> 00:23:17,308
The man who comes through
when all else fails.

407
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:18,266
So they tell me.

408
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:26,796
Afternoon, Lou.

409
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,841
I'm glad I caught you.

410
00:23:30,757 --> 00:23:34,935
I want you to take a
look at these, Lou.

411
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:36,676
These are the projections
on what we're going to make

412
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:37,764
as soon as the building's up.

413
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:43,509
What building?

414
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:47,426
Come on up.

415
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:48,557
Just a quarter to play.

416
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:49,993
Just a quarter.

417
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:53,867
Win yourself a very nice
doll-- very nice doll.

418
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,390
How are you doing?

419
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,392
Uh, do you want to play?

420
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,524
It's just a quarter.

421
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:00,351
You can win yourself
a nice doll.

422
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:01,352
Like the chances.

423
00:24:01,396 --> 00:24:03,833
Love the chances.

424
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:07,794
You can set a quarter
on any name you want.

425
00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:09,317
Yeah, give me some change.

426
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,319
Okey-doo.

427
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:19,283
Here we go-- 2, 3, 4,
5, and that 5 is 10.

428
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:21,677
You get a quarter on
any name you want.

429
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:29,946
Bud, Dan-- that's my name.

430
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:30,730
Yeah?

431
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:31,905
Yeah.

432
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:35,125
Dot, All right,
press the button.

433
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,657
And we have Bud.

434
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,181
[inaudible] You caught a winner.

435
00:24:47,224 --> 00:24:48,225
You get a doll.

436
00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:49,662
What kind of doll do you want?

437
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:51,141
I want to play for
some real money.

438
00:24:51,185 --> 00:24:52,142
That's illegal.

439
00:24:52,186 --> 00:24:53,143
Yeah, I know.

440
00:24:53,187 --> 00:24:55,145
Give me 50 to 1.

441
00:24:55,189 --> 00:25:00,107
OK, you got 10 to 1 on
the inside, dollar minimum.

442
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:03,806
Hey, I bet you get more dollars
now than you get quarters, huh?

443
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:04,590
Huh?

444
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:05,329
Right?

445
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:11,074
Bud?

446
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:12,989
[inaudible] be twice in a row.

447
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:19,518
Loser.

448
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:27,090
Irv!

449
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:28,570
That your name?

450
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:29,745
Uh, yeah.

451
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:31,051
-It is?
-Yeah.

452
00:25:31,094 --> 00:25:31,965
Well, good luck, Irv.

453
00:25:38,014 --> 00:25:40,147
It's off.

454
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:40,887
Sorry.

455
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:10,481
Nope, sorry.

456
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:12,483
Hey!

457
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:14,877
Hey, hey, Irv!

458
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:32,460
Now, you don't
have to say a word.

459
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:40,163
The old bastard won't
give you a dime, right?

460
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:42,078
You know, for a minute
there, I though you had him.

461
00:26:42,122 --> 00:26:43,732
I did.

462
00:26:43,776 --> 00:26:45,255
I did have him.

463
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:46,561
He wants to give us $1 million.

464
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,177
He wants the whole deal
for a fast million.

465
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:56,397
He wants to buy us out?

466
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,267
Believe that?

467
00:26:57,311 --> 00:26:58,573
The nerve of that guy.

468
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:10,716
You know, it might not
be a bad deal, Richard.

469
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:12,239
We might even turn a profit.

470
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:17,374
I say let's take his offer.

471
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:19,463
At the very least,
we'll break even.

472
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:21,422
Come on, Phil.

473
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:26,340
I want a lot more out of this
deal than just breaking even.

474
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:27,863
I can be a very rich
man when this is over.

475
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:29,604
And you're not going to
do so badly out of it

476
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,346
yourself, my friend.

477
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:36,698
You don't expect me to
back out now, do you?

478
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:40,267
Hey, Phil, let's get
out of here before I

479
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:43,487
lose my confidence in you.

480
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:45,925
Hey, come on, Phil.

481
00:27:45,968 --> 00:27:48,101
I'm busting my ass to
make this thing work,

482
00:27:48,144 --> 00:27:49,015
and it's going to work.

483
00:27:55,064 --> 00:27:56,979
Ahoy matey.

484
00:27:57,023 --> 00:27:59,373
[cheering]

485
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:06,772
Come on, [inaudible]

486
00:28:29,142 --> 00:28:32,754
Jesus, I thought that three
was a sure winner, you know?

487
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:34,234
[inaudible]

488
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:36,715
Thatta boy, [inaudible] hey!

489
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:38,717
I'm going to do it, man.

490
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,719
I am.

491
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,851
You're going to
do what, my friend?

492
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:43,591
Nothing.

493
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:53,079
[inaudible]

494
00:28:53,122 --> 00:29:02,697
ANNOUNCER: --at the
break returns $52.20.

495
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,524
[cheering]

496
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:05,178
Fuck you, Sonny!

497
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:05,874
Fuck you!

498
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:17,277
You know how to
work the TV, right?

499
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,060
Oh, sure.

500
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:19,583
And let's see.

501
00:29:19,627 --> 00:29:20,584
I left a number where I'll
be at the tennis club.

502
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:22,630
It's on that pad in the kitchen.

503
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:23,413
Oh, OK, Mrs. Banks.

504
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:24,371
Oh, and the stereo.

505
00:29:24,414 --> 00:29:25,198
You know how to work that?

506
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:25,981
That's that knob.

507
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:27,983
I'm sure he knows.

508
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:28,810
Let's see.

509
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:30,029
What else?

510
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:31,682
LUCY: Oh, we'll be
fine, Mrs. Banks.

511
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:33,336
MRS. BANKS: Oh, you know
where the kids rooms are?

512
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,077
LUCY: Uh-huh.

513
00:29:35,121 --> 00:29:36,252
MRS. BANKS: And if Jeremy wakes
up, give him some orange juice.

514
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:37,688
If she wakes up,
just talk to her.

515
00:29:37,732 --> 00:29:38,602
She loves to talk.

516
00:29:38,646 --> 00:29:39,952
LUCY: I know.

517
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:41,823
Next stop, the kitchen.

518
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:43,564
You know how to work
the oven and everything?

519
00:29:43,607 --> 00:29:45,871
You just switch
this dial, and it'll

520
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:47,350
ring when everything's ready.

521
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:50,832
LUCY: You have a fabulous
kitchen, Mrs. Banks.

522
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:53,574
Well, I guess I'm ready to go.

523
00:29:53,617 --> 00:29:54,749
Think I'll just check the kids.

524
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,794
Oh, let me come with you.

525
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,708
I never get to see the children.

526
00:29:57,752 --> 00:29:59,014
Come on, Roland.

527
00:29:59,058 --> 00:29:59,928
You have to see these
gorgeous children.

528
00:29:59,972 --> 00:30:01,495
ROLAND: Right.
Come on.

529
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:05,194
Be very quiet, OK?

530
00:30:05,238 --> 00:30:06,587
Careful of that wire.

531
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:13,463
[WHISPERING] Isn't he cute?

532
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:29,175
Oh, what a pretty
little-- oh, look, Roland.

533
00:30:29,218 --> 00:30:30,263
[inaudible]

534
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:31,612
ROLAND: Yeah.

Look, I got to talk to
you about something.

539
00:31:14,263 --> 00:31:15,438
Huh?
Oh, later.

540
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:16,352
Come here Roland.

541

Sit down.

Sit.

544
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:35,067
OK, first, you add
the ketchup, see?

545
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:43,336
Hm, and then, um--
oh, wait a minute.

546
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:44,380
Wait a minute.

You see, Roland?

549
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:52,388
Roland, I've already added the
BAKEN-ETS, the green pepper,

my special ingredient,

551

the oatmeal-- to
stretch it, you know?

552
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:00,875

You

553
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:01,920
Careful of your ashes, Roland.

554
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,225
It's not in the recipe.

555

Oh, come on, Roland.

572

The trouble with you is
you're just not romantic.

573

Look, Richard, if you're
going to go for a slam,

do you know how we score that?

614
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:17,311
That means you get 2,500
a piece from each of us

00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,356
if you make it.

616
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:21,271

If it's only money,
I'll double you.

00:43:24,253 --> 00:43:25,428
Hang in there, Dick.

722
00:43:32,697 --> 00:43:34,612
Hey, Richard.

723
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:39,617
Your secretary called, said
your ex-wife called her at home.

724
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,835
It's an emergency.

725
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:42,750
Is she on now?

726
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:44,447
She said for you to
get in touch with her.

727
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:46,188
Didn't say what
it was all about.

728
00:43:46,232 --> 00:43:47,886
Said your ex was
pretty shook up.

729
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:49,278
You better call,

730
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:51,063
Oh Christ.

731
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:53,195
Let's finish Austin's
hand of cards first.

732
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:55,067
Well, aren't you going to call?

733
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:56,459
I'll call Ellen, all right.

734
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:57,678
Probably the washing
machine that broke down.

735
00:43:57,722 --> 00:43:58,592
Let's play.

736
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,376
Come on.

737
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,422
Here's your food.

738
00:44:02,465 --> 00:44:05,033
-I don't like to eat in the car.
-That's for you.

739
00:44:05,077 --> 00:44:06,252
I'll throw up.

740
00:44:06,295 --> 00:44:07,035
That's for you.

741
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:08,080
Can I get out?

742
00:44:08,123 --> 00:44:09,472
There.

743
00:44:09,516 --> 00:44:10,691
There are some fries--
some fries for you.

744
00:44:10,735 --> 00:44:12,475
Hold on to them.

745
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:14,347
There are some fries for you.

746
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,350
OK, put this thing down.

747
00:44:17,393 --> 00:44:20,745
I-- I-- um, um, um, tomato.

748
00:44:20,788 --> 00:44:23,704
Tomato [inaudible]

749
00:44:23,748 --> 00:44:25,053
OK, we got to get going now.

750
00:44:25,097 --> 00:44:26,185
And ketchup.

751
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:27,012
Huh?

752
00:44:27,055 --> 00:44:27,882
And mustard.

753
00:44:32,408 --> 00:44:34,541
Round two.

754
00:44:34,584 --> 00:44:36,804
Changed my goddamned
mind at the last minute.

755
00:44:36,848 --> 00:44:37,762
OK, call Ellen.

756
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:48,642
All right, I'll call Ellen.

757
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,123
You know, she cost me a
hell of a lot of money.

758
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:52,733
I'm thinking about
her, and I'm trying

759
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:53,995
to play cards at the same time.

760
00:44:56,998 --> 00:44:58,870
Hell, I can play the jack.

761
00:44:58,913 --> 00:45:01,220
Who put the Jack there?

762
00:45:01,263 --> 00:45:04,310
I need a drink.

763
00:45:04,353 --> 00:45:06,225
Oh, and get me a beer while
you're up, too, will ya?

764
00:45:06,268 --> 00:45:07,052
And get the cigars.

765
00:45:07,095 --> 00:45:10,011
They're on the bar.

766
00:45:10,055 --> 00:45:10,751
Fries.

767
00:45:16,626 --> 00:45:18,541
Ellen, Ellen, will
you please calm

768
00:45:18,585 --> 00:45:19,760
down, because I
can't understand what

769
00:45:19,804 --> 00:45:20,848
the hell you're saying to me.

770
00:45:22,676 --> 00:45:23,416
Come on.

771
00:45:23,459 --> 00:45:24,373
Come on.

772
00:45:24,417 --> 00:45:26,854
We got to go. [inaudible].

773
00:45:26,898 --> 00:45:28,334
We got to go.

774
00:45:28,377 --> 00:45:30,336
Hold on to your brother.

775
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:32,730
[inaudible]

776
00:45:38,257 --> 00:45:40,694
[crying]

777
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,131
Don't start crying.

778
00:45:43,175 --> 00:45:45,003
You two talked me
into coming here.

779
00:45:45,046 --> 00:45:46,221
I was doing you a favor.

780
00:45:46,265 --> 00:45:47,179
You can't drive.

781
00:45:47,222 --> 00:45:48,571
I'll get sick.

782
00:45:48,615 --> 00:45:49,355
You won't get sick.

783
00:45:49,398 --> 00:45:50,269
Yes, I will.

784
00:45:50,312 --> 00:45:51,052
You will not.

785
00:45:51,096 --> 00:45:53,359
Yes.

786
00:45:53,402 --> 00:45:55,535
Wait a minute.

787
00:45:55,578 --> 00:45:57,189
I think we're even a
few thousand ahead.

788
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:03,586
Anything wrong?

789
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,718
No, I gotta go.

790
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:05,501
I'm sorry.

791
00:46:05,545 --> 00:46:06,589
I'm really sorry.

792
00:46:06,633 --> 00:46:09,418
Hey, wait, anything wrong?

793
00:46:09,462 --> 00:46:11,116
Anything we can do for you?

794
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:12,770
Uh, no, not a thing.

795
00:46:12,813 --> 00:46:14,554
One of my kids is
sick-- my daughter.

796
00:46:14,597 --> 00:46:16,164
She keeps calling for
me, so I better go.

797
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:17,644
Yeah, those kids really
love their old man.

798
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:19,341
Yeah, they do.

799
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:21,430
Uh, figure out what I owe you
and give me a call tomorrow.

800
00:46:21,474 --> 00:46:22,736
Sure, yeah.

801
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,606
I'm really sorry to
break up the game.

802
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:24,477
Hey, it's no problem.

803
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,652
We can play some gin.

804
00:46:25,695 --> 00:46:26,653
Oh, and I'm sorry
about that hand.

805
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:27,785
I should have played that king.

806
00:46:27,828 --> 00:46:28,655
That's OK.

807
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:29,830
It's only money.

808
00:46:29,874 --> 00:46:33,268
You go take care of that kid.

809
00:46:33,312 --> 00:46:33,965
All right.

810
00:46:57,162 --> 00:46:58,293
Roland would never
hurt the children.

811
00:47:02,471 --> 00:47:05,866
He's just a little crazy
sometimes, I guess.

812
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,085
That's enough.

813
00:47:07,128 --> 00:47:08,216
I'm going to call the police.

814
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,262
No, no, no, don't do that.

815
00:47:10,305 --> 00:47:11,872
He'll bring them back.

816
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:12,742
Please wait.

817
00:47:12,786 --> 00:47:13,700
Richard's going to come.

818
00:47:13,743 --> 00:47:15,615
Please wait.

819
00:47:15,658 --> 00:47:17,051
Why should we wait?

820
00:47:17,095 --> 00:47:18,966
For God's sake, this
maniac has your children.

821
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,620
He is not a maniac.

822
00:47:20,663 --> 00:47:21,403
Wait, Howard.

823
00:47:21,447 --> 00:47:22,535
Please just wait.

824
00:47:22,578 --> 00:47:24,537
Richard will know what to do.

825
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,712
He's the children's father too.

826
00:47:28,758 --> 00:47:30,673
Right, Mrs. Banks.

827
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:33,111
Roland knows how to take
care of the children.

828
00:47:33,154 --> 00:47:35,200
He's watched me take
care of children before.

829
00:47:35,243 --> 00:47:36,679
He knows what to do.

830
00:47:36,723 --> 00:47:40,770
What does he want,
Lucy, to ransom them?

831
00:47:40,814 --> 00:47:42,729
I'll give him money.

832
00:47:42,772 --> 00:47:44,513
Oh, I'll-- I'll
give him anything.

833
00:47:44,557 --> 00:47:47,995
Just call him, please, and
tell him I want them back,

834
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:49,170
please, Lucy. [sobbing]

835
00:47:49,214 --> 00:47:51,042
[phone ringing]

836
00:47:51,956 --> 00:47:53,305
You answer.

837
00:47:53,348 --> 00:47:54,306
He knows you.

838
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:02,575
Hello?

839
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:10,975
Um, oh, um, Mrs. Banks
can't come to the phone.

840
00:48:14,065 --> 00:48:16,850
Oh yes, yes.

841
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,678
Yes, Mr. Banks called
a few minutes ago.

842
00:48:21,594 --> 00:48:26,164
No, Mrs. Banks wants me to
thank you for contacting him.

843
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:29,863
Um, um, yes, yes,
it's all right.

844
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:30,820
Nothing's wrong.

845
00:48:30,864 --> 00:48:32,039
It's just a family matter.

846
00:48:35,695 --> 00:48:39,220
Fine, OK, thank you.

847
00:48:39,264 --> 00:48:39,917
Goodbye.

848
00:48:47,446 --> 00:48:50,188
Why are we keeping
this such a big secret?

849
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:53,147
Because Richard said to, and
he knows about these things.

850
00:48:56,194 --> 00:48:58,196
LUCY: My mother always said
that people's own troubles

851
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:00,198
embarrass them most.

852
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:01,808
There's no use letting
everybody know.

853
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:07,857
That's not it, Lucy.

854
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:13,211
Richard probably just
doesn't want to upset Roland.

855
00:49:13,254 --> 00:49:16,083
We don't want that.

856
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:22,176
We don't want Roland to
do something too hastily,

857
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,047
you know?

858
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:27,486
I'm sorry.

859
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:36,408
Richard.

860
00:49:36,451 --> 00:49:39,367
He took the children!

861
00:49:39,411 --> 00:49:40,760
He took the children.

862
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,593
ANNOUNCER [ON TELEVISION]:
Bases loaded, one out.

863
00:49:47,636 --> 00:49:50,074
The Yankees 2 and the Orioles
2 in the top of the seventh.

864
00:49:53,903 --> 00:49:55,514
Outfield deep,
and straight away.

865
00:49:55,557 --> 00:49:58,212
The infield back in
double play depth.

866
00:49:58,256 --> 00:49:58,996
[inaudible]

867
00:50:05,872 --> 00:50:07,700
Why would he kidnap for ransom?

868
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,006
We all know who he is.

869
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:10,050
It doesn't make sense.

870
00:50:10,094 --> 00:50:11,225
So what if we know who he is?

871
00:50:11,269 --> 00:50:12,531
We don't know where
he is, Howard.

872
00:50:12,574 --> 00:50:14,054
What does he care if
we know who he is?

873
00:50:14,098 --> 00:50:15,447
[inaudible]

874
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:16,535
That's fine.

875
00:50:16,578 --> 00:50:17,231
Thank you.

876
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:21,018
Ellen.

877
00:50:28,155 --> 00:50:31,419
Tell me something.

878
00:50:31,463 --> 00:50:36,076
Was your boyfriend interested
in drugs or anything?

879
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,036
We're both followers of
the cosmogenetic faith.

880
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:43,301
We don't believe in polluting
our minds or our bodies.

881
00:50:43,344 --> 00:50:44,476
You're the followers of what?

882
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:47,000
The cosmogenetic faith.

883
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,829
Oh, that's terrific.

884
00:50:49,872 --> 00:50:53,006
OK, Howard.

885
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,182
How long have you
known this guy?

886
00:50:55,226 --> 00:50:57,315
Roland?

887
00:50:57,358 --> 00:50:59,099
Roland.

888
00:50:59,143 --> 00:51:01,362
About six months.

889
00:51:01,406 --> 00:51:04,974
He came to the hospital where
I worked with a lacerated toe.

890
00:51:05,018 --> 00:51:08,413
He cut it on a shell.

891
00:51:08,456 --> 00:51:19,163
I was dressing it, and we got
to talking, and, well, you know.

892
00:51:19,206 --> 00:51:20,816
That's very romantic.

893
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:21,948
Uh, Richard, listen.

894
00:51:21,991 --> 00:51:22,949
I'm a lawyer.

895
00:51:22,992 --> 00:51:24,472
I'm an officer of the court.

896
00:51:24,516 --> 00:51:26,996
I have no right to hold this
from the police anymore.

897
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:27,780
Ellen?

898
00:51:27,823 --> 00:51:28,650
I don't know.

899
00:51:28,694 --> 00:51:29,956
Listen to me, Howard.

900
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:31,262
You make one move
to call the police,

901
00:51:31,305 --> 00:51:32,915
and I'll kick your
goddamn teeth in.

902
00:51:32,959 --> 00:51:34,395
Now, I mean it, Howard.

903
00:51:34,439 --> 00:51:36,658
Who knows what this--
this Roland is going to do

904
00:51:36,702 --> 00:51:37,920
if the cops start chasing him.

905
00:51:37,964 --> 00:51:39,792
And you're so qualified
to deal with it?

906
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:41,663
They are my kids,
Howard, and I'll

907
00:51:41,707 --> 00:51:43,187
decide what to do with them.

908
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:44,623
So you just keep your
goddamned nose out of this.

909
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:46,538
Why don't you get
out of my house?

910
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:48,279
Your house?
Your house?

911
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:49,889
If it was your house, it would
have been lost a long time ago.

912
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:51,151
Please.

913
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:52,587
Get him out of here
before I kill him.

914
00:51:52,631 --> 00:51:53,545
Will you stop it!

915
00:51:53,588 --> 00:51:55,416
[phone ringing]

916
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,374
That's Roland.

917
00:51:56,417 --> 00:51:59,725
I know it is.

918
00:51:59,768 --> 00:52:02,728
Hello, is this Banks?

919
00:52:02,771 --> 00:52:04,773
Hey, hello, Mr. Banks.

920
00:52:04,817 --> 00:52:06,079
How are you doing?

921
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:09,126
This is the guy
who's got your kids.

922
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:10,823
Hey, yeah, yeah, sure
they're all right.

923
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:14,348
They're sitting
here watching TV.

924
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:17,438
But look, what I called about
is if you want your kids back,

925
00:52:17,482 --> 00:52:20,702
it's going to cost you, right?

926
00:52:20,746 --> 00:52:24,576
Uh, 200 grand--
100 grand apiece.

927
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:27,144
How's that?

928
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:28,406
Oh, come on, Mr. Banks.

929
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:29,146
You're loaded.

930
00:52:32,279 --> 00:52:35,021
Yeah, sure, sure.

931
00:52:35,064 --> 00:52:37,415
Hey, you want to
say hello to Daddy?

932
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:38,155
Yes.

933
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:42,550
Hi, Daddy.

934
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:49,644
I'm watching a silly show on TV.

935
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:51,994
We're in Paris.

936
00:52:52,038 --> 00:52:53,692
Are you going to
come and get us?

937
00:52:53,735 --> 00:52:55,259
I want to talk.

938
00:52:55,302 --> 00:52:55,998
[inaudible]

939
00:53:02,701 --> 00:53:04,181
Please give me the phone.

940
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:07,619
Bye, Daddy.

941
00:53:07,662 --> 00:53:08,533
Bye, Daddy.

942
00:53:13,146 --> 00:53:16,236
I was finished talking.

943
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,152
Jesus, why'd she
hang up like that?

944
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,372
Taught her to.

945
00:53:21,415 --> 00:53:25,724
She used to leave phones off
the hook all over the house.

946
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:29,249
What'd she say again, parish?

947
00:53:29,293 --> 00:53:30,642
No.

948
00:53:30,685 --> 00:53:34,515
I think Paris.

949
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,996
Well, where's
your Yellow Pages?

950
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:40,217
Maybe there's a Paris or
a Parish Hotel somewhere.

951
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,479
I mean, it's worth a try.

952
00:53:41,522 --> 00:53:43,263
Shut up, Howard.

953
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:44,569
Just shut up, will you?

954
00:53:44,612 --> 00:53:45,265
He'll call back.

955
00:53:48,747 --> 00:53:53,491
When he calls back,
Richard, just tell him we'll

956
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:54,840
give him whatever he wants.

957
00:53:58,322 --> 00:54:00,585
ROLAND: Yeah, the
shopping mall, man.

958
00:54:00,628 --> 00:54:02,804
[inaudible]

959
00:54:02,848 --> 00:54:05,242
ROLAND: Hey, don't
worry what I look like.

960
00:54:05,285 --> 00:54:07,592
I'll find you.

961
00:54:07,635 --> 00:54:22,084
Here's 11,000,
6,100, 2,600, 17,000.

962
00:54:22,128 --> 00:54:24,304
Here are some bonds.

963
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:34,358
500, 750, 25-- $25-- 750.

964
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:41,190
500, 750, 25-- $25-- 750.

965
00:54:41,234 --> 00:54:42,583
What's this?

966
00:54:42,627 --> 00:54:44,977
Why is my passport here?

967
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:48,241
Here's another bond-- $5,000.

968
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:51,940
My father sent this to the
kids when Jeremy was born.

969
00:54:55,161 --> 00:55:03,169
There's 20,000 in this account,
a bond for 50 from your mother,

970
00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:05,519
bond for 750.

971
00:55:05,563 --> 00:55:09,871
This is written to both
of us-- a wedding present.

972
00:55:09,915 --> 00:55:15,660
500-- that's for something
I don't remember.

973
00:55:15,703 --> 00:55:17,009
I don't care.

974
00:55:17,052 --> 00:55:21,970
25 from your mother--
it's another one.

975
00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:26,366
More bonds-- why do
I have so many bonds?

976
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,716
I I never knew I
had so many bonds.

977
00:55:32,807 --> 00:55:34,635
Here's some contract
or something.

978
00:55:38,073 --> 00:55:39,858
No, it's a will.

979
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,819
It's our wills.

980
00:55:44,863 --> 00:55:45,820
Take this.

981
00:55:45,864 --> 00:55:46,865
Just take everything.

982
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:48,432
Just get the kids back, Richard.

983
00:55:48,475 --> 00:55:49,215
RICHARD: Don't worry.

984
00:55:57,832 --> 00:56:00,444
There's stock
certificates in the vault.

985
00:56:00,487 --> 00:56:01,532
We should get them out.

986
00:56:59,894 --> 00:57:00,765
[inaudible]

987
00:58:05,612 --> 00:58:08,746
Roger, give me the winning
number for yesterday.

988
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:10,399
I may get the right one.

989
00:58:10,443 --> 00:58:16,493
6, 6, [inaudible] I
dreamt of sixes two nights

990
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:19,583
running a week ago,
and I didn't play.

991
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:21,846
MAN [ON INTERCOM]: Come
along, with Captain Skull

992
00:58:21,889 --> 00:58:23,282
and sail the seven seas.

993
00:58:23,325 --> 00:58:23,978
[inaudible]

994
00:58:28,896 --> 00:58:30,376
[laughing]

995
00:58:30,419 --> 00:58:31,508
NEWSCASTER [ON TELEVISION]That
final score again.

996
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,900
[inaudible] 3, Orioles, 2.

997
00:58:32,944 --> 00:58:36,077
Temperatures reached a
high yesterday of 92.

998
00:58:36,121 --> 00:58:38,123
And they're expected to
go back to that today.

999
00:58:38,166 --> 00:58:40,386
The National Weather Service
predicts a possibility

1000
00:58:40,429 --> 00:58:42,997
of the mercury hitting
100 this afternoon,

1001
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:46,392
with clear blue skies
and no chance of rain.

1002
00:58:46,435 --> 00:58:48,307
The ocean temperature is 74.

1003
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:49,526
The air quality is--

1004
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:52,398
[bells chiming]

1005
00:59:16,291 --> 00:59:17,597
WOMAN: Good morning, Mr. Banks.

1006
00:59:21,209 --> 00:59:23,647
Jim.

1007
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:25,300
Richard, how are you?

1008
00:59:25,344 --> 00:59:27,085
Sit down.

1009
00:59:27,128 --> 00:59:28,129
[QUIETLY] Somebody's here.

1010
00:59:28,173 --> 00:59:29,566
Tell him I'll get back to him.

1011
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,879
Well, how'd you make out with
that fellow you told me about?

1012
00:59:38,923 --> 00:59:40,315
Not too well.

1013
00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:42,100
I saw him yesterday, and
he wasn't interested.

1014
00:59:42,143 --> 00:59:43,971
But I did get some money
from another source.

1015
00:59:44,015 --> 00:59:44,929
Good.

1016
00:59:44,972 --> 00:59:45,930
Enough to cover the month?

1017
00:59:45,973 --> 00:59:46,844
Well, just about.

1018
00:59:46,887 --> 00:59:49,107
I have 200,000.

1019
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:52,327
Well, that's
certainly something.

1020
00:59:52,371 --> 00:59:55,069
If we apply the 200,000 to
this note that's due now,

1021
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:56,767
they should cancel
the foreclosure

1022
00:59:56,810 --> 00:59:58,725
and not bother you again until
you've got everything ready.

1023
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:01,641
If you had a check with you, we
could put it through right now.

1024
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:02,903
That will certainly
make them happier

1025
01:00:02,947 --> 01:00:04,252
with you upstairs, Richard.

1026
01:00:04,296 --> 01:00:06,994
Well, I certainly hope so.

1027
01:00:07,038 --> 01:00:08,953
What I have here
are some savings

1028
01:00:08,996 --> 01:00:12,609
accounts and some bonds.

1029
01:00:12,652 --> 01:00:13,827
They're all in my wife's name.

1030
01:00:13,871 --> 01:00:15,524
All the withdrawal
slips are signed

1031
01:00:15,568 --> 01:00:16,961
and the bonds are all endorsed.

1032
01:00:17,004 --> 01:00:18,484
Oh, you got it from your wife?

1033
01:00:18,527 --> 01:00:20,007
Well, she has a big
interest in the project.

1034
01:00:20,051 --> 01:00:22,662
And I sort of convinced her
she ought to protect it.

1035
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:24,316
JIM: Good for you.

1036
01:00:24,359 --> 01:00:27,145
Well, it all looks
all right to me.

1037
01:00:27,188 --> 01:00:32,890
Here, just fill this out
to renew the other notes,

1038
01:00:32,933 --> 01:00:33,804
and you should be fine.

1039
01:00:37,372 --> 01:00:39,810
Could I get about $25,000 of
this in cash, do you think,

1040
01:00:39,853 --> 01:00:41,725
Jim?

1041
01:00:41,768 --> 01:00:46,512
In other words, you only
want to put down 175,000.

1042
01:00:46,555 --> 01:00:47,861
I'd rather have it all, Dick.

1043
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:54,694
Well, I need about 15,000 to
finish things up at the site,

1044
01:00:54,738 --> 01:00:58,263
and I could use the
other 10 personally.

1045
01:00:58,306 --> 01:01:00,700
I could sign another
note for the 25,000.

1046
01:01:00,744 --> 01:01:03,137
JIM: I don't think they'll
take another note, Dick.

1047
01:01:03,181 --> 01:01:04,791
Why don't you try to limp
by on what you've got

1048
01:01:04,835 --> 01:01:08,142
and let me give them
the whole 200,000?

1049
01:01:08,186 --> 01:01:10,492
You're a pretty resourceful
fellow, Richard.

1050
01:01:10,536 --> 01:01:13,191
You can come up with
25,000 somewhere, I'm sure.

1051
01:01:13,234 --> 01:01:14,540
No, I can't.

1052
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:16,411
I'm pretty far out
over the edge as it is.

1053
01:01:16,455 --> 01:01:18,326
I can tell you it was
not an easy matter

1054
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:19,501
coming up with this money.

1055
01:01:19,545 --> 01:01:21,678
It was really just
luck, actually.

1056
01:01:21,721 --> 01:01:23,984
JIM: Can you do with 10,000?

1057
01:01:24,028 --> 01:01:25,812
That way I could
give them 190,000.

1058
01:01:25,856 --> 01:01:27,292
It sounds almost like 200.

1059
01:01:27,335 --> 01:01:29,555
If that's the best
you can do, OK.

1060
01:01:29,598 --> 01:01:33,037
JIM: Here, let's take one
of these books to a teller.

1061
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,693
This one in trust for your
daughter has about 10,000.

1062
01:01:36,736 --> 01:01:37,476
Thanks, Jim.

1063
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:38,825
My pleasure.

1064
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:40,435
I'm glad everything
turned out all right.

1065
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,175
Me too.

1066
01:01:51,446 --> 01:01:52,839
Could you make out
a check for this?

1067
01:01:52,883 --> 01:01:55,276
Make it cash, please--
fifties and twenties.

1068
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:57,888
That's a lot of bills.

1069
01:01:57,931 --> 01:02:01,761
Put it in a bag
for him, will you?

1070
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:03,632
Well, I'll put everything
into work right away.

1071
01:02:03,676 --> 01:02:04,895
I'll call you this
afternoon, just

1072
01:02:04,938 --> 01:02:06,026
to verify that everything's OK.

1073
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:07,027
But don't worry.

1074
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:07,767
There won't be any problem.

1075
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:08,550
I'm sure.

1076
01:02:08,594 --> 01:02:09,377
Thanks a lot, Jim.

1077
01:02:14,992 --> 01:02:16,689
JIM: Hey, how are the kids?

1078
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,169
You have two, don't you?

1079
01:02:18,212 --> 01:02:19,866
That's right--
a boy and a girl.

1080
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:20,693
They're just fine.

1081
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,651
Glad to hear it.

1082
01:02:22,695 --> 01:02:27,134
Well, here's your money.

1083
01:02:27,178 --> 01:02:29,006
Jim, thanks again.

1084
01:02:57,512 --> 01:02:58,470
Whee!

1085
01:02:58,513 --> 01:02:59,688
[laughing]

1086
01:02:59,732 --> 01:03:01,429
Now, look, you
kids just sit still,

1087
01:03:01,473 --> 01:03:04,345
because Daddy is going to be
with you in about five minutes.

1088
01:03:07,131 --> 01:03:07,784
Daddy!

1089
01:03:27,499 --> 01:03:28,717

MAN [ON INTERCOM]:
--a black button.

1091
01:03:30,241 --> 01:03:32,765
And you can save money
if you get one right now.

1092
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:36,203
It's a bargain at our
[inaudible] prices.

1093
01:03:36,247 --> 01:03:40,207
But it's a real steal at our
sale price of just $19.99.

1094
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:41,121
Imagine [inaudible].

1095
01:03:44,211 --> 01:03:46,823
Excuse me, sir. [inaudible]

1096
01:03:52,741 --> 01:03:56,528
Oh, uh, uh, yeah, I've never
been here before [inaudible]

1097
01:03:56,571 --> 01:03:57,834
It's quite all right.

1098
01:03:57,877 --> 01:04:00,532
Just put the dime
right in there, sir.

1099
01:04:00,575 --> 01:04:02,969
MAN [ON INTERCOM]: In honor
of still another member

1100
01:04:03,013 --> 01:04:04,971
of the famous
[inaudible] family,

1101
01:04:05,015 --> 01:04:08,845
Mr. [inaudible] we
present the graffiti mug.

1102
01:04:40,615 --> 01:04:42,791
Wouldn't it be great
to have a miniature oil

1103
01:04:42,835 --> 01:04:44,489
lamp hanging in your room?

1104
01:04:44,532 --> 01:04:47,709
They look absolutely far out,
and they really work too.

1105
01:04:47,753 --> 01:04:48,667
You can fill them--

1106
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:49,668
May I help you, sir?

1107
01:04:49,711 --> 01:04:53,628
I'm passing through.

1108
01:04:53,672 --> 01:04:55,630
MAN [ON INTERCOM]: The

1110
01:04:58,677 --> 01:05:00,548

1111
01:05:16,651 --> 01:05:17,522
See something you like.

1112
01:05:21,134 --> 01:05:22,483

Morning.

1115
01:06:29,115 --> 01:06:31,509
Morning.

1116
01:06:31,552 --> 01:06:34,512
You the maid?

1117
01:06:34,555 --> 01:06:36,993
Yeah, I am.

1118
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:38,646
Who are you?

1119
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:41,084
My name's Lucy.

1120
01:06:41,127 --> 01:06:41,998
I babysit here.

1121
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:49,353
Miss Bank's upstairs asleep.

1122
01:06:49,396 --> 01:06:52,051
Oh.

1123
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:53,444
We were up all night.

1124
01:06:57,535 --> 01:07:00,668
Where are the children?

1125
01:07:00,712 --> 01:07:04,977
Um, Mr. Banks has them.

1126
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:07,849
I mean, uh, he's
picking them up now.

1127
01:07:12,419 --> 01:07:15,596
Why, you want to make
them lunch or something?

1128
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,163
No, was just wondering.

1129
01:07:20,471 --> 01:07:23,735
Oh, Mr. Banks should
be back any minute.

1130
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:28,696
Do you know what time it is?

1131
01:07:32,526 --> 01:07:33,223
11 o'clock.

1132
01:07:36,617 --> 01:07:40,447
Guess I better get to work.

1133
01:07:40,491 --> 01:07:43,102
Where's Mr. Bank
picking up the children,

1134
01:07:43,146 --> 01:07:44,321
their grandmother's house?

1135
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:47,933
I don't know.

1136
01:07:47,976 --> 01:07:48,803
I guess so.

1137
01:07:54,548 --> 01:07:55,549
He should be back any minute.

1138
01:07:58,422 --> 01:08:00,250
I'm going to wake up Mrs. Banks.

1139
01:08:00,293 --> 01:08:02,295
Why?

1140
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:04,689
Why you want to wake her up?

1141
01:08:04,732 --> 01:08:05,690
She has to pay you?

1142
01:08:05,733 --> 01:08:06,691
I'll give you the money.

1143
01:08:06,734 --> 01:08:08,040
She can pay me back.

1144
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:11,348
No need to disturb her.

1145
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:13,872
Well, I think she'll want to be
up when the children are here.

1146
01:08:13,915 --> 01:08:15,178
Why?

1147
01:08:15,221 --> 01:08:17,963
What for?

1148
01:08:18,006 --> 01:08:19,573
Because my boyfriend
kidnapped them.

1149
01:08:19,617 --> 01:08:21,227
That's why.

1150
01:08:21,271 --> 01:08:23,099
He tied me up, and he
took the children away.

1151
01:08:25,797 --> 01:08:26,450
They call the police?

1152
01:08:30,367 --> 01:08:32,151
No, they were afraid
to call the police.

1153
01:08:32,195 --> 01:08:33,935
I mean, they didn't want
to get the police involved.

1154
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:36,982
So Mr. Banks went with the
money early this morning.

1155
01:08:40,072 --> 01:08:41,160
He should be back by now.

1156
01:08:41,204 --> 01:08:42,857
Well,he isn't.

1157
01:08:42,901 --> 01:08:45,338
Now, where did your boyfriend
take these children?

1158
01:08:45,382 --> 01:08:46,905
Come on.

1159
01:08:46,948 --> 01:08:48,776
I don't know.

1160
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:50,038
You don't know?

1161
01:08:50,082 --> 01:08:51,649
He didn't tell you
anything about it?

1162
01:08:51,692 --> 01:08:54,695
Where are the children, girl?

1163
01:08:54,739 --> 01:08:55,479
I don't know.

1164
01:08:55,522 --> 01:08:56,175
He tied me up.

1165
01:09:03,574 --> 01:09:07,230
Where did Mr.
Banks get the money?

1166
01:09:07,273 --> 01:09:08,927
I think Mrs. Banks
gave it to him.

1167
01:09:11,712 --> 01:09:13,932
Look, don't ask me anymore.

1168
01:09:13,975 --> 01:09:14,759
I gotta go to work.

1169
01:09:18,545 --> 01:09:22,549
You won't tell
anybody, will you?

1170
01:09:22,593 --> 01:09:24,725
No, girl.

1171
01:09:24,769 --> 01:09:25,552
Don't forget.

1172
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:30,905
You stay here.

1173
01:09:30,949 --> 01:09:32,516
I'm going to go and
wake up Mrs. Banks.

1174
01:09:56,496 --> 01:09:57,193
ROLAND: Park over there.

1175
01:10:33,011 --> 01:10:34,969
You got to be kidding me, man.

1176
01:10:35,013 --> 01:10:35,883
Take the money, Roland.

1177
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,283
Fuck you.

1178
01:10:48,679 --> 01:10:50,942
Oh, you think you're
a big operator, right?

1179
01:10:50,985 --> 01:10:52,596
Trying to buy me
off with 10 grand?

1180
01:10:58,166 --> 01:11:00,038
Fuck your 10 grand.

1181
01:11:10,527 --> 01:11:15,271
I'll explain it again, Roland.

1182
01:11:15,314 --> 01:11:19,318
You just take this
money, and you disappear.

1183
01:11:19,362 --> 01:11:20,232
Get away from me, buddy.

1184
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,233
I don't want that money.

1185
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:22,408
No one will come after you.

1186
01:11:22,452 --> 01:11:23,670
And that is a promise.

1187
01:11:23,714 --> 01:11:26,194
Yeah, a promise, right.

1188
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:27,587
Look.

1189
01:11:27,631 --> 01:11:30,024
Just tell me where the
children are, Roland,

1190
01:11:30,068 --> 01:11:30,982
and then you can get off.

1191
01:11:31,025 --> 01:11:31,852
You'll be free.

1192
01:11:37,554 --> 01:11:39,207
Look, I'm tired of
telling you, man.

1193
01:11:39,251 --> 01:11:41,297
I want it all.

1194
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,342
Eat something, Mrs. Banks.

1195
01:11:43,386 --> 01:11:47,477
No, no, I will later.

1196
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,827
[dog barking]

1197
01:11:54,222 --> 01:11:56,877
Where are they?

1198
01:11:56,921 --> 01:11:57,574
They'll be here soon.

1199
01:12:12,371 --> 01:12:13,024
Shit.

1200
01:12:20,118 --> 01:12:21,467
Goddamned fucking machine.

1201
01:12:38,049 --> 01:12:40,399
Listen, mister, I
need that 200 grand.

1202
01:12:45,056 --> 01:12:47,667
I had this thing all
figured out, man.

1203
01:12:47,711 --> 01:12:49,887
And I need all of that money.

1204
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:53,412
God damn it, now
I need that money.

1205
01:12:53,456 --> 01:12:55,240
I wouldn't hurt your kids, man.

1206
01:13:02,769 --> 01:13:05,163
I just need the money.

1207
01:13:05,206 --> 01:13:07,774
Why?

1208
01:13:07,818 --> 01:13:11,299
Because I'm tired
of scrounging, man.

1209
01:13:11,343 --> 01:13:15,173
I'm tired of scrounging
my whole life.

1210
01:13:15,216 --> 01:13:16,783
I know what you mean, Roland.

1211
01:13:20,744 --> 01:13:24,617
[LAUGHING] That's
no lie, Roland.

1212
01:13:40,024 --> 01:13:43,462
That damned money.

1213
01:13:43,506 --> 01:13:44,985
When you have it,
somebody's always trying

1214
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:46,465
to take it away from you.

1215
01:13:46,509 --> 01:13:51,252
You know, you have to
keep protecting it.

1216
01:13:51,296 --> 01:13:58,085
Funny thing is, deep
down, you really should

1217
01:13:58,129 --> 01:14:02,220
feel guilty about having it.

1218
01:14:02,263 --> 01:14:08,922
So when someone really wants
your money, he can get it.

1219
01:14:08,966 --> 01:14:15,363
See, you want to give it
away, because deep down you

1220
01:14:15,407 --> 01:14:21,674
feel uncomfortable having it.

1221
01:14:21,718 --> 01:14:25,112
I don't know.

1222
01:14:25,156 --> 01:14:28,464
I guess you want to be
even with everybody else.

1223
01:14:45,437 --> 01:14:47,308
Why don't you take
the Cadillac too?

1224
01:14:53,837 --> 01:14:56,753
Take the money.

1225
01:14:56,796 --> 01:14:58,494
Leave me here.

1226
01:14:58,537 --> 01:15:00,670
By the time I walk back up to
the road, you're long gone.

1227
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,804
Take the money.

1228
01:15:13,944 --> 01:15:15,249
You got to sign over
the registration too.

1229
01:15:40,274 --> 01:15:41,145
Take off your watch.

1230
01:15:41,188 --> 01:15:42,929
What?

1231
01:15:42,973 --> 01:15:43,800
The gold watch.

1232
01:15:43,843 --> 01:15:44,540
I've been noticing it.

1233
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:45,323
I want it.

1234
01:15:45,366 --> 01:15:46,237
My watch.

1235
01:15:55,159 --> 01:15:56,029
What about my kids?

1236
01:15:59,598 --> 01:16:02,035
I told you not to worry, man.

1237
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:03,559
What about my kids, Roland?

1238
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:08,389
I want to get the
car started first.

1239
01:16:08,433 --> 01:16:09,826
I want to make sure there
are no double crosses.

1240
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:20,967
They're at the shopping mall.

1241
01:16:21,011 --> 01:16:23,100
They're in the parking
lot at the shopping mall.

1242
01:16:23,143 --> 01:16:24,841
You rode right past
them, you dumb bastard.

1243
01:16:39,986 --> 01:16:41,205
They're in a blue VW, man.

1244
01:16:41,248 --> 01:16:43,294
They're locked up.

1245
01:16:43,337 --> 01:16:44,948
You got my kids
in a locked car?

1246
01:16:44,991 --> 01:16:46,427
You son of a bitch.

1247
01:16:46,471 --> 01:16:47,603
Hey, hey, hey they're fine.

1248
01:16:47,646 --> 01:16:49,605
They're fine.

1249
01:16:49,648 --> 01:16:51,519
A blue VW-- you

1250
01:17:15,152 --> 01:17:16,022
Is that a car?

1251
01:17:21,114 --> 01:17:22,028
It's OK.

1252
01:17:22,072 --> 01:17:23,551
They're OK.

1253
01:17:23,595 --> 01:17:24,683
Where are the
children, Richard?

1254

Where are the children?

1256

I took them to the hospital.

We'll got to the

I'm going to call the hospital,
and if they're not there,

1270
01:17:53,016 --> 01:17:53,886

We should have
called the police.

1274

This is all your fault.

Where's Roland?

1281

And how should I know?

1282
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:40,019
He didn't hurt the children.

1283
01:18:40,063 --> 01:18:42,718
He left them in a locked
car in this god damn heat!

1284
01:18:54,425 --> 01:18:55,339
He just wanted the money.

1285
01:18:55,382 --> 01:18:56,035
That's all.

1286
01:19:07,003 --> 01:19:07,960
It's all right.

1287
01:19:08,004 --> 01:19:10,484
They're OK.

1288
01:19:10,528 --> 01:19:11,877
Here's the keys to your car.

1289
01:19:11,921 --> 01:19:13,139
Go move it so we can get out.

Oh.

1291
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:15,315
I'm sorry, Mrs. Banks.

1292
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:16,795
I'm sorry for everything.

1293

Well, what about Roland.

1297
01:19:21,147 --> 01:19:22,932
Are you going to
call the police?

1298
01:19:22,975 --> 01:19:24,455
What's the point?

1299
01:19:24,498 --> 01:19:29,373
What about the money?

1300
01:19:29,416 --> 01:19:30,243
I don't care.

Hi, Mommy.

What's that bandage?

1306

Oh, it's nothing serious.

lighter in the car,

1309
01:20:38,877 --> 01:20:40,183
and she's got a little
burn on her lip.

1310
01:20:40,226 --> 01:20:41,967
It's not bad.

1311

Hi, honey, you feel all right?

1313
01:20:46,972 --> 01:20:48,626
We were locked in a car, mom.

1314
01:20:48,669 --> 01:20:50,976
Everything's going
to be all right.

1315
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:52,891

Good.

I'd like a room-- a

All right, just sign.
