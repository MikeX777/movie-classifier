1
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,840
Call me Ishmael.

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,399
Whenever it is a dark,
drizzly November in my soul,

3
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:28,522
and it requires
a strong moral principle

4
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,400
to prevent me from
stepping into the streets

5
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,779
and methodically knocking
people's hats off,

6
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:40,284
I account it high time
to get to sea as soon as I can.

7
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:44,118
Wherefore it is
I should take it into my head

8
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,578
to go on a whaling voyage,

9
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:50,086
doubtless it forms part of
the grand program of Providence

10
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,758
that was drawn up
a long time ago.

11
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:56,884
They came to see me?
I am Ahab!

12
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:05,810
Chief among my motives
is the great whale himself.

13
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,858
Such a portentous
and mysterious monster

14
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:13,689
rouses all my curiosity
and sways me to my wish.

15
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:20,578
I stuffed a shirt or two
into my old carpetbag,

16
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:25,375
tuck it under my arm
and start for Nantucket.

17
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,920
What? Who are you?
No, no, no, stop!

18
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:21,347
Please, please, no, let me...
Who are you?

19
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,850
What is happening?
What's happening? No!

20
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,849
- Please, stop, stop!
- Mother.

21
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,146
- Let me go!
- Mother!

22
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,565
Let me go! Rebecca!

23
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,768
- Rebecca!
- Mother!

24
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,354
Tobias, what is happening?

25
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,064
- Her coat.
- Mother!

26
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,569
- Rebecca!
- Mother.

27
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,777
- Rebecca!
- Rebecca! Rebecca, please!

28
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,327
It's time for bed.

29
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,413
Rebecca!

30
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,536
Wait, what is happening?

31
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,373
What's happening?
Let me go!

32
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,835
Please! Please stop!

33
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,340
I have a daughter!

34
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,296
Stop!

35
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,278
Put it on.

36
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,947
Now!

37
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,538
In the bed.

38
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,624
Come!

39
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,921
It is a dismal night.

40
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,347
Bitingly cold.

41
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:49,519
I know no one in the place.

42
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,768
Not far from the docks,
I come upon an out-hanging light

43
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:55,771
and a sign over a door.

44
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:57,477
Good evening.

45
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,688
Do you perchance have a room
available for the night?

46
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:03,195
Alas, my house is full.
Not a bed unoccupied.

47
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,197
But you ain't got
no objections

48
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,075
to sharing a harpooner's
blanket, have ye?

49
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,282
I suppose
you are going a-whaling,

50
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,368
so you'd better get used
to that sort of thing.

51
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,454
I never like to sleep
two in a bed,

52
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:19,382
but rather than wander about a
strange town on so bitter night,

53
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:22,552
I reckon I'll put up with half
of any decent man's blanket.

54
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,924
Come on, I'll show ya
to your room.

55
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,428
He'll be here afore long.

56
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,635
He's a decent enough chap
and pays regular.

57
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,721
Make yourself comfortable.

58
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,184
Good night to ye.

59
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,909
Good morning,
Mrs. Wallace.

60
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,746
I am Miss Stokes,
the head matron.

61
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:54,166
Please. I have a daughter.

62
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,244
She's 8 years old.

63
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,914
- You are sick.
- No, I'm not sick.

64
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,126
I'm not sick, I'm not sick.
Please let me talk to a doctor.

65
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,758
You need to stop
the dramatics.

66
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,883
This institution respects
obedient women

67
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,935
who participate in treatment.

68
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,808
Those are the women
who have daughters.

69
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,943
You've made a mess
of your breakfast.

70
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,989
You'll have to go hungry.

71
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,697
Cheer up.

72
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,953
This is a place of healing.

73
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,959
Whoa!

74
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,713
Thank you, Clyde.

75
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:52,551
You have a pleasant day
at the madhouse, Doctor.

76
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,306
How many times
must I tell you, Clyde?

77
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,934
We must call it hospital.

78
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,516
Welcome to the snake pit.

79
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,315
I don't belong here.

80
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,984
Neither do I, dearie.

81
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,440
I'm old and an inconvenience,

82
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,115
but I ain't mad.

83
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,362
Yeah, let's do it!

84
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,240
Fuck! Shit!

85
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,696
Shut your filthy mouth!

86
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,826
Fuck!

87
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,838
- The board is waiting.
- Yes.

88
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,511
- How do I look?
- Marvelous.

89
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,304
- Is the chairman there?
- Of course he is.

90
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,598
Do you remember your speech?

91
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,223
Uh, <i>Moby Dick...</i>

92
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:23,024
Melvin's masterwork
of obsession...

93
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:27,023
- Madness.
- And madness upon the sea.

94
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,025
It is this story, gentleman...

95
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,529
that I propose
to bring to life here,

96
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:35,783
with our patients
playing the roles.

97
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,582
A play?

98
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,877
A theatrical production?

99
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:46,582
A technique pioneered by
Dr. Jacoby at Doublehill.

100
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,418
And used with great success.

101
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:01,103
The theater provides
a means of self-explanation

102
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,771
and self-knowledge.

103
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,017
Is that not what we strive
to provide for our patients?

104
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,900
Preposterous.

105
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,354
We are here to treat
these poor souls,

106
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,155
not to set them prancing
about like chimpanzees.

107
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,076
Oars and harpoons
in the hands of lunatics.

108
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,493
Insane.

109
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:20,038
We'll give them prop weapons,
of course.

110
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,414
Dr. Calhoun,
I agreed to employ you here

111
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,586
as a favor to your father,
who assured me

112
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:29,382
that your perverse fascination
with the theater was behind you.

113
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:33,461
Yet you sit here before us
asking to put on a play.

114
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,921
Therapy!

115
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:40,101
I confess my love
for the theater is unabated,

116
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:44,271
but I come to you now
as a man of medicine.

117
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,771
My only concern is
the welfare of my patients.

118
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,070
I realize I am new here.

119
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,820
But I've been around
long enough to recognize

120
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,116
that the old methods...

121
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,786
isolation, ice-therapy,
leeches...

122
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,707
they do not work.

123
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,577
Well...

124
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,708
we could try it
on the female inmates.

125
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,256
They may be more docile.

126
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,924
Women?

127
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:20,342
Gentleman, all of the roles
in <i>Moby Dick</i> are for men.

128
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,643
Who gives a damn?

129
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,352
It's women or nothing.

130
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,689
Benjamin?

131
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,150
Hmm.

132
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:48,245
I think a play is a fine idea.

133
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,625
They mean to discourage you.

134
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,250
They shan't.

135
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,463
Let's begin casting.

136
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:03,767
Ah, Bernadette!

137
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,345
Bernadette, take your time

138
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,307
and then whenever
you're ready, begin.

139
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,754
Call me Ishmael.
Whenever it is a damp, drizzly November...

140
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,269
Wonderful, Bernadette!

141
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,604
Thank you.

142
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,817
Ah, Freda, yes!

143
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,903
Take your time, okay?

144
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,362
Call me...

145
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,540
Ishmael.

146
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,583
I can't read.

147
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,378
Kara!

148
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,084
Kara, Kara.

149
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,462
Wait!

150
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,924
Be gentle with her!
Be gentle!

151
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,555
Easy.

152
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,682
Come here. Let me see it.

153
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,810
I just want to see it.

154
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,404
Maybe we should
take a break.

155
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,160
Perhaps she could be
our Queequeg?

156
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,367
I don't know.
Queequeg is called a savage,

157
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,980
but he's really
one of the more intelligent...

158
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,586
Trust me on this, Matron.

159
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,915
I'm sorry.
I don't think I know you.

160
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,500
Yes, you.

161
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,174
Do you read?

162
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,678
Call me Ishmael.

163
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,264
Whenever it is a damp,
drizzly November in my soul,

164
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,896
and it requires a strong
moral principle

165
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,694
to prevent me from
stepping into the street

166
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,693
and methodically knocking
people's hats off,

167
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:45,619
then I account it high time
to get to sea as soon as I can.

168
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,324
You are new, Miss...

169
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,831
Mrs. Wallace.
Isabel Wallace.

170
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:58,508
She was committed last night
by her husband, a minister.

171
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:02,212
Well, Mrs. Wallace,
I'm Dr. Benjamin Calhoun.

172
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,386
Welcome.

173
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,841
Isn't it exciting?

174
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:10,144
I've always wanted
to be an actress.

175
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,938
Is it always like this?

176
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,892
We get a bit of sugar
on Sundays.

177
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,442
Sometimes.

178
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,481
Not hungry, Mrs. Wallace?

179
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,567
Farm animals eat better.

180
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,574
You should be thankful
you get anything at all.

181
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,577
Thank you, Matron.

182
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,076
Dr. Calhoun wants to see you.

183
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:39,506
So I have some exciting news.

184
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:44,128
I have cast you
in the role of Ishmael.

185
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,350
Uh...

186
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,351
Have you acted before?

187
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,104
I lead the church choir.

188
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,730
Well, splendid!

189
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:03,110
Perhaps your experiences there
will aid us in...

190
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,940
I'm not mad.

191
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,327
Well, let's see.

192
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,407
I have your file right here.

193
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,625
"Isabel Wallace.

194
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,455
committed at the request
of Reverend Tobias Wallace."

195
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,915
No, Mrs. Wall...

196
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,466
Good heavens.

197
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,382
This is the work of my husband.

198
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,965
He's an angry, wrathful man.

199
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,518
Now there must be something
to prove my sanity.

200
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,223
Some kind of test...

201
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,686
You have been found insane,
committed by the authorities.

202
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,237
What if I wrote letters?

203
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,031
I have friends
at the Ladies' Society.

204
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:49,281
- My church, who can intercede...
- Mrs. Wallace, it is very...

205
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,157
I have a daughter.

206
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:55,491
She is eight years old,
and she's alone <i>with him.</i>

207
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,499
Please.

208
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,381
There must be
something you can do.

209
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,684
Yes. I will make inquiries.

210
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,022
Don't think that you can
improve your situation

211
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,651
by batting your eyes
at the doctors, Mrs. Wallace.

212
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,903
You'll soon learn
who's really in charge.

213
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,468
Can I climb in with you?

214
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,771
I'm so cold,
I can't even feel my own body.

215
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,043
Isabel.

216
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:25,123
Come. Lie with me.

217
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,259
I don't feel that well tonight.

218
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,221
You will fulfill
your wifely duty.

219
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,629
Okay, this is the part
where Ishmael meets Queequeg.

220
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:09,880
There is a heavy footfall
in the passage.

221
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,380
Holding a lantern,

222
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,929
a tall dark figure
enters the room.

223
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:17,508
Kara, you are Queequeg.

224
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,140
That is your cue. Enter.

225
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,017
Good. Uh...

226
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:26,225
What a sight.
Such a face.

227
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,311
Dark and tattooed in squares,

228
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,396
his hair tied up
in a scalp-knot.

229
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,947
We'll get your makeup later.

230
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,491
A strange object
dangles from his hand.

231
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,570
Matron, if you can get Kara
a prop please.

232
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,575
Let's do that.

233
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,373
It is a shrunken human head.

234
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,076
Give it.

235
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,880
Queequeg extinguishes the light
and springs into bed.

236
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,753
You spring into bed.

237
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,175
Oh! Ow!

238
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,595
Okay, okay, Kara, Kara,
not so rough.

239
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,422
You want to see who she is.

240
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,884
Very gentle.

241
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,344
Okay, okay, Kara?

242
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,897
I want to show you
what I'm talking about.

243
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,144
Get up.

244
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,356
Thank you. Good, good.

245
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,985
I'm going to grab this from you.
I'll give it back.

246
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,568
All right, so to bed,
and I'm going...

247
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,873
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

248
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,292
I'm fine.

249
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,290
Yes.

250
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,962
Very well.

251
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,791
Well, this is
make-believe, ladies.

252
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,250
Okay, um...

253
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,054
Uh, who the devil are you?

254
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:45,933
Speaketh! Tell me!

255
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,184
Who are you?!

256
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:52,145
Angel, save me! Landlord!

257
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:55,322
You did not tell me
my bedmate was a savage.

258
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,865
Huh!

259
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,694
Queequeg wouldn't harm
a hair of your head.

260
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,824
That's a shrunken head?

261
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,533
He brought a lot of embalmed
heads from the South Seas.

262
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,083
As curios, you know.

263
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,956
- Queequeg!
- Yeah?

264
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,084
This man sleepy.

265
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,291
You, you sabbee?

266
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,674
Me sabbee plenty.

267
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,629
You gettee in.

268
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,091
Thank you, landlord.
You may go.

269
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:33,352
Yes, uh, so at that moment,
uh...

270
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,905
you will get into bed with Kara.

271
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,153
Kara, get in bed.

272
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,109
You will get in bed
next to Ishmael.

273
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,949
Okay.

274
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:51,253
Well, I think we're
making real progress.

275
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,500
Oh, my God.

276
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,630
Dr. Calhoun,
I can rehearse with her.

277
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,337
That would be lovely.
Thank you, Isabel.

278
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,683
They took
her beautiful clothes away

279
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,261
and dressed her
in an old gray smock.

280
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,642
Just look at
the proud princess now!

281
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,645
They laughed as they led her
into the kitchen.

282
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,819
Let's get to bed, okay?

283
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,567
I'll read you some more
tomorrow.

284
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,902
All right, darling, sleep well.

285
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,987
Sweet dreams, okay?

286
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,663
- I love you.
- Love you.

287
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,533
Why is she awake?

288
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:32,461
It's my fault.
I lost track of time.

289
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,037
Let's get to bed.

290
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,125
How are things proceeding
with Kara?

291
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,926
- Quite well.
- Good.

292
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,675
No! Don't do that!

293
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,802
Aagh!
It's a feature of her condition.

294
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,134
She devours all sorts
of awful things.

295
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,788
Kara, look at your mouth.
You're a mess.

296
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,891
Come on, sit, sit.

297
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,644
Come. Come sit.

298
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,351
Why don't we face
each other here?

299
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,773
Are you ready to play the scene
for Dr. Calhoun?

300
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,575
We'll play the scene
where we become friends.

301
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,996
Were you shaving
with the harpoon?

302
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,953
Queequeg is a comely looking
cannibal.

303
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,585
I find myself
mysteriously drawn to him.

304
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:21,510
I see a lofty bearing,
a simple honest heart,

305
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,757
and in his dark eyes,

306
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,682
a spirit that would dare
a thousand devils.

307
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,224
Queequeg, what say you
to a social smoke?

308
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,478
Oh, um, use my pipe.

309
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,518
Here.

310
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,069
We are now bosom friends

311
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,240
and resolve to ship
aboard the same vessel.

312
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,572
Bravo!

313
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,622
Quite good, quite good.

314
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,041
- She's come so far.
- Mm-hmm.

315
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,244
She's a really
sweet girl

316
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:58,330
and eager to please once she
knows what's expected of her.

317
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,041
Yes.

318
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:04,219
Well, Isabel, um...

319
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:10,050
I was giving your situation
a great deal of thought,

320
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:14,309
and if you pen a letter
to the Ladies' Society,

321
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,061
I'll do my best
to see it delivered.

322
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:20,110
Thank you.
Thank you, Dr. Calhoun.

323
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,779
No! No!

324
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:25,448
Kara, don't eat the goldfish!

325
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,623
The anchor is up,
the sail is set,

326
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,797
and the short northern day
merges into night,

327
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:44,297
as we blindly plunge like fate
into the lone Atlantic.

328
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,051
Our captain's name is Ahab.

329
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,974
He's lost his leg to a whale
on his previous voyage.

330
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,847
For several days,

331
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,600
no sign has been seen of him
above hatches.

332
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,681
He stays in his cabin.

333
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,859
Whosoever of ye
raises me a white-headed whale...

334
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:04,109
Mary, louder, please.
I can barely hear you.

335
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,983
A crooked jaw
and three holes!

336
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,659
That's a bit too loud.

337
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,611
Why don't we try
for a happy medium.

338
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,574
Mary, show some respect.

339
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,175
I didn't know she'd do that.

340
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:32,303
It's not your fault, Matron,
but I am beginning to despair.

341
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:35,010
Without an Ahab,
we have no play.

342
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,187
Well, there is
one other possibility.

343
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,534
Why the devil
didn't you tell me?

344
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,616
She's considered dangerous.

345
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:05,499
I thought you said her last
incident was a year ago.

346
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,926
Because she's been
in isolation since.

347
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:10,470
She nearly bit off
a nurse's finger.

348
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,924
Then we'll have to wear gloves.

349
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:23,567
Miss Price, I'm Dr. Calhoun.

350
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:29,030
I'm here to inform you
of a new therapy of my design.

351
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,194
I saw you at Edward Fry's
Opera House.

352
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:37,702
As Lady Macbeth,
you mesmerized me.

353
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,126
We're doing a play.

354
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,794
Melville's <i>Moby Dick.</i>

355
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,841
I want you to be my Ahab.

356
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,965
Goodbye, Miss Price.

357
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:05,146
Beatrice Price.
Have you lost all sense?

358
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:08,273
We have her in isolation
for a reason.

359
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,321
She is violent.

360
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,864
Vicious!

361
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,284
The misdeeds these women
committed in former lives

362
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,407
ought not weigh
against them here.

363
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:21,288
Beatrice Price is a murderess
and a sexual deviant.

364
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,790
Allowing her access
to these women

365
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,964
would be like loosing
a fox in a henhouse.

366
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,962
I'll take full responsibility.

367
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:33,420
I have no doubt
my therapy will aid her.

368
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,767
Wait, wait, wait.

369
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,691
Beatrice Price.

370
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:51,942
On stage, please.

371
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:55,785
Act one, scene five.

372
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:05,081
Miss Price, you are reading
for the role of Captain Ahab.

373
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,832
I'll be holding your script.

374
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,788
I don't need a damn script.

375
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:17,555
On such a day,

376
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,600
one as sweet as this,

377
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,724
I struck my first whale.

378
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:29,981
A boy harpooner of 18,
40 years ago.

379
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:35,486
Forty years of constant whaling.

380
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:40,992
Forty years
of privation, peril.

381
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:44,370
Storm time on the pitiless seas.

382
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,875
For 40 years has Ahab
forsaken peaceful land

383
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:53,208
to make war
on the horrors of the deep.

384
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,427
Then the madness.

385
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:00,340
The frenzy.

386
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:03,973
The boiling blood
and the smoking brow

387
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:07,773
with which,
for a thousand lowerings,

388
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:12,353
has Ahab furiously...

389
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:15,234
and foamingly chased his prey

390
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:18,613
more demon than man.

391
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:24,619
Aye, what a forty years' fool
has old Ahab been.

392
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,711
Brava!

393
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,462
Brava!

394
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,878
Ohh!

395
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:39,008
I hope for your sake,
you can control her.

396
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,842
If there's a slip-up,
I'll have you fired.

397
00:26:55,489 --> 00:27:02,077
At last Ahab stands before us
with a crucifixion in his face.

398
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:07,999
A grand, ungodly God-like man,
he lives in this world

399
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:12,204
as the last grizzly bears
live in settled Missouri.

400
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:16,382
His grim aspect
affects me powerfully,

401
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,712
as does the barbaric white leg
in which he stands.

402
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:29,225
What do ye do
when ye see a whale?

403
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,680
Sing out for him!

404
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,140
And what do ye next?

405
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,476
Lower away and after him!

406
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,404
And what song do ye pull to?

407
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,197
A dead whale
or a stove boat!

408
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:45,370
Do you see this Spanish
ounce of gold, men?

409
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,536
Aye, Captain!

410
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,366
Oh, my, she is quite good.

411
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,121
Yes!

412
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,123
I insisted
she be in the play.

413
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,797
A wrinkled brow,
a crooked jaw,

414
00:27:56,884 --> 00:28:01,094
and three holes
in his starboard fluke.

415
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,641
He... shall have
this gold doubloon.

416
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:10,474
Captain Ahab,
is this white whale

417
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,897
the one they call
Moby Dick?

418
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:17,603
Aye. It was Moby Dick
that dismasted me.

419
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,608
Sliced off my leg

420
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:23,317
like a mower reaps
a blade of grass in the field.

421
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,868
This is what ye ship for, men.

422
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:30,164
To chase Moby Dick
over all sides of the Earth,

423
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,460
until the white whale
spouts black blood.

424
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,755
Ye harpooners,
flank me with your lances.

425
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,925
Cross them here before me.

426
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:46,803
Death to Moby Dick!

427
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:52,513
God hunt us all if we do not
hunt him to his death.

428
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,771
It's such a relief being
out of that straightjacket.

429
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:02,981
Such a bother not being able
to scratch your nose or reach...

430
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,362
the important bits.

431
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,906
Mind if I borrow some thread?

432
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,871
Some thread, I said.

433
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,925
Much obliged.

434
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,055
You're a quiet little mouse.

435
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,508
Married to a minister,
they tell me.

436
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,645
Now how does a minister's wife

437
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:38,850
end up in an ungodly place
like this?

438
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,687
- You'd have to ask my husband.
- Oh?

439
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,739
And what story would he tell,
a cold bed?

440
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,488
Quiet little church mouse
like you,

441
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:51,321
an iceberg has better chance
of pleasing a husband.

442
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:54,249
Is there anything moving
under the sea,

443
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,623
or is it frozen
down there as well?

444
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,884
Every minister I ever met
had a horny pecker.

445
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,509
They just wrap
a white collar around it.

446
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,810
I could teach you...

447
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,604
about passion.

448
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:21,355
Thaw the iceberg, as it were.

449
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,271
Hmm?

450
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,570
Get off of me,
you foul woman!

451
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,821
Is that the best you've got?

452
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:35,531
You're a whaler now.
Curse like one.

453
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,242
Call me a bitch, a whore.

454
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:39,623
Whore! Bitch!

455
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,045
That's the idea!

456
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,088
- Fuck! Cocksucker!
- Fuck! Cocksucker!

457
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:46,009
- Shit!
- That's how sailors talk.

458
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,586
What else do they have to do
on those long voyages,

459
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,592
eh, church mouse?

460
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,218
That's enough out of you two!

461
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,773
The chief mate of the <i>Pequod</i>
is Starbuck,

462
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,725
a native of Nantucket,

463
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:06,358
a staid, steadfast man.

464
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:09,282
Why the long face, Starbuck?

465
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:12,111
I am game for
his crooked jaw, Captain,

466
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:15,493
if it fairly comes in
the way of our business.

467
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,541
But I came to hunt whales,
not my commander's...

468
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:21,461
What's the matter, Starbuck?

469
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,257
You are pathetic.

470
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,381
Okay.

471
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,383
"My commander's vengeance
on a dumb brute

472
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,556
that simply smote thee
from blind instinct."

473
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,385
- Come on, Silla.
- I can't work with this.

474
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,265
Are we to believe
this whelping thing

475
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,312
is first mate of the <i>Pequod?</i>

476
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,892
You will work with whoever
Dr. Calhoun tells you to work.

477
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,022
No, she is right.

478
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:50,107
Ahab needs a Starbuck,
a seadog.

479
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,112
But you see, Miss Price,

480
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,694
I have a very limited
talent pool here.

481
00:31:56,373 --> 00:32:00,993
What about her?
She looks like she has balls.

482
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,213
No, no, Matron Stokes
is not an actress,

483
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,631
and she has a job to do.

484
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,130
Let her finish the scene
with me.

485
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,177
I did some acting in school.

486
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,650
I am game...

487
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:37,870
I am game for his crooked jaw,
Captain,

488
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,370
if it fairly come in the way
of our business.

489
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,952
But I came to hunt whales,
Captain,

490
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,662
not my commander's vengeance
on a dumb brute

491
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,373
that simply smote thee
from blindest instinct.

492
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,505
Dumb brute?

493
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:56,681
He has left innumerable
fatalities in his wake.

494
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:02,433
I see in him not only
outrageous strength,

495
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:07,859
but intelligent,
inscrutable malice.

496
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,687
God keep us all.

497
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,322
Let's keep going,
keep going.

498
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,954
Horrible old man.

499
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:28,084
My soul is overmatched
by a madman.

500
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,916
Starbuck thinks me mad.

501
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,170
But I am demonic.

502
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,346
I am madness maddened.

503
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,516
I plainly see
my miserable office,

504
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:43,561
to obey, rebelling.

505
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:47,231
And I must help him
to his impious end.

506
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:51,027
Ye great gods,
come see if ye can swerve me.

507
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,900
Ye cannot swerve me!

508
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:58,985
My path to my fixed purpose
is laid with iron rails,

509
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:04,325
whereon my soul
is grooved to run.

510
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:08,331
I'd strike the sun
if it insulted me.

511
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,209
Yet there is hope.

512
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,882
Time and the tide flow wide,

513
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:18,589
and the hated whale has the
round, watery globe to swim in.

514
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,099
I like it.

515
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,181
Are you willing, Matron?

516
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:30,517
Anything I can do
to help, Doctor.

517
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,526
Boo!

518
00:34:44,124 --> 00:34:47,492
Prettying yourself up
for your private rehearsal?

519
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,791
You're pretty enough for me,
church mouse.

520
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,668
Let me through.

521
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:57,126
Couldn't hurt
your hopes of a release,

522
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,086
if you open your legs
for him.

523
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,842
He doesn't see me that way.

524
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,673
Oh, my, my, my.

525
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,350
How cloistered you've been.

526
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:07,724
Come, come.

527
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,976
I promise to be good.

528
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:19,236
I've seen the way
he looks at you.

529
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,493
Lick your lips.

530
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,715
Now rub them together.

531
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,099
A bit less ruined,
don't you think?

532
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:49,888
A bit.

533
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:55,021
And Cinderella
shall go to ball.

534
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:00,273
That's my daughter's
favorite story.

535
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,826
Mine too.

536
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:08,156
I guess this makes me
the fairy godmother.

537
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,085
♪ You came from far away ♪

538
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:17,791
♪ My dear, my dear ♪

539
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:21,343
♪ You came from far away ♪

540
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:25,548
♪ My dear, my dear ♪

541
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,430
♪ You... ♪

542
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,682
Isabel.

543
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:31,933
Please sit.

544
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,568
Uh, before we begin,

545
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:44,446
I'd like to tell you

546
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,573
I sent your missive
to Mrs. Van Dyke

547
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,154
of the Ladies' Society

548
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,865
and enclosed your letter
to Rebecca.

549
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:53,201
Thank you, Dr. Calhoun. I...

550
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,536
I had almost given up hope.

551
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,169
Please, when it's just us,
you can call me Benjamin.

552
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:00,795
And it is I who should be
thanking you.

553
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,377
Your work here
has been exemplary.

554
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,880
It's been exhilarating.

555
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:07,556
Oh, it is, isn't it?

556
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:11,056
Blindly plunging like fate
into the lone Atlantic.

557
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,692
My first love
was always the theater.

558
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,020
When I was a boy,
my mother would say,

559
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:25,154
"Benjamin
you're going to be a thespian."

560
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:29,408
She would take me
to the theater every week.

561
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,739
So I dropped out
of medical school,

562
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,120
much to my father's chagrin.

563
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,372
You became a doctor, after all.

564
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:40,168
Yes.

565
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,009
Well...

566
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,679
my mother...

567
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,758
she took her own life.

568
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,056
She was troubled.

569
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:55,604
Suffered from hysteria.

570
00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:00,685
So I was compelled
to take up medical school again

571
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:05,023
with a focus on lunacy.

572
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,358
But I feel trapped.

573
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,738
I do.

574
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,241
Just like you.

575
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,332
It isn't the same.

576
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,875
Oh, no, of course not.

577
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,501
No, it isn't.

578
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,135
I'm sorry.

579
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:29,305
Well, let's get to work.
The whale hunt, I believe.

580
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:41,359
You're a good man, Benjamin.

581
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:45,364
Ah!

582
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,778
Here we are.

583
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,325
From here.

584
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:55,660
The boat tears on.

585
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:00,290
The vast swells
of the omnipotent sea.

586
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,667
The surging, hollow roar
they make.

587
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,758
Without the script.

588
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,053
The brief suspended agony

589
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,927
as the boat tips
on the knife-edge of the waves

590
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,384
that threaten
to cut us in two.

591
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,721
The sudden profound dip.

592
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:25,695
The headlong sled-like slide
down the other side.

593
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:30,525
No raw recruit
marching for the first time

594
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,452
into the fever heat
of his first battle

595
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,780
has felt stronger emotions

596
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,581
than the man who,
for the first time,

597
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,125
finds himself
in the churned circle

598
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,624
- of the hunted sperm whale.
- Sperm whale.

599
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,673
Thar she blows!

600
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,885
There she blows
on the lee-beam!

601
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:00,767
Pull, my fine hearts! Pull!

602
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:03,349
Break your backs!
Sing out!

603
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:06,686
A dead whale
or a stove boat!

604
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:10,068
Snap your oars,
every mother's son of ye!

605
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:14,072
Yes! Feel the surging waves!
I want to see sweat!

606
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,324
Deidre, I want you to...

607
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,532
Bodies in motion.
Bodies in motion.

608
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:22,118
The devil fetch ye,
you dogs.

609
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,827
Pull, will ye?

610
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,709
Long and strong!

611
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,666
Keep rowing! Come on, ladies!
We're on a boat!

612
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,343
- Keep rowing! Keep on going!
- Looky-loo!

613
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,512
There's his hump!

614
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,136
Aim for his eye!
Give it to him!

615
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:39,889
All of a sudden, a gush of
scalding liquid shoots up.

616
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,767
Something rolls
like an earthquake beneath us.

617
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:46,066
We are tossed into the
curdling cream of the squall.

618
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,360
In, in, in, in!

619
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:55,280
You're flailing
in the ocean, ladies!

620
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,202
The waves
are washing over you.

621
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,950
The waves are washing over you!

622
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,030
All right, come on,
everybody up.

623
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:17,094
Ishmael, you've got
a certain little glow.

624
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,220
You've gone and done it,
haven't you?

625
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,721
You naughty little church mouse.

626
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,849
You mustn't say a thing.

627
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,487
We should keep this
between us.

628
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:46,706
Oh, there you are.

629
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:48,207
How are you this morning?

630
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,334
Perfectly well.
And you?

631
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,337
Marvelous.

632
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:57,047
Ahab ferociously studies his
charts and plans his course.

633
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,633
In the east, you will be my
beast.

634
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:04,516
That is where I shall
wreak my revenge.

635
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,016
That's your cue, Starbuck.

636
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,772
The oil in the hold
is leaking, sir.

637
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,649
We must heave to
and repair.

638
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:15,322
And spend a week
tinkering with old gaskets?

639
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:18,242
But we could waste more oil
in one day

640
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,989
than we make good
in a full year.

641
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,696
What does Ahab care?
On deck.

642
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,578
Captain!

643
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,832
Does thou dare contradict me?

644
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,708
Nay, sir.

645
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,915
I do but entreat thee.

646
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:41,094
There is but one God
that lords over the Earth

647
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:43,927
and one captain
that lords over the <i>Pequod.</i>

648
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,229
On deck!
Thou hast outraged me.

649
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:48,806
Thou hast outraged me, sir.

650
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,900
And for that, I ask thee
not to beware of Starbuck.

651
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,817
Thou wouldst but laugh.

652
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:56,488
But let Ahab beware of Ahab.

653
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,657
Beware of thyself, old man.

654
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:05,448
Doctor!

655
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,584
Hold on. It's okay.

656
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,206
Keep going.
Keep the intensity.

657
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,756
There is one God.

658
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,299
Eh, Starbuck?

659
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,718
Eh?!

660
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,842
Yes! All right.

661
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,265
Now let her go.
Beatrice, stop at once!

662
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:24,711
- All right, all right.
- Beatrice!

663
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:32,524
All right.

664
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,854
Well, that certainly
was visceral.

665
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,860
She almost killed me.

666
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:43,194
If I wanted to kill you,
you would be dead.

667
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,404
You said you wanted
to be in the play.

668
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:48,036
Then be in the play!

669
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,083
It seems to me
what you really want

670
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,456
is Calhoun's cock
in your quim.

671
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:55,130
But guess what.
Ishmael beat you to it.

672
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:58,505
That is enough nonsense
out of you, Beatrice!

673
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,310
- Benjamin.
- Huh?

674
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:11,685
What's going on between
you and that Wallace woman?

675
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:14,608
Absolutely nothing.

676
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:16,026
Then what was
Price talking about?

677
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,853
Another attempt to needle you.

678
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:24,242
Come now, Phoebe,
you mustn't let her upset you.

679
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:28,572
You know I would never
consort with a patient.

680
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,243
Phoebe, I need you
on my side.

681
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:37,081
Without you, this entire
enterprise collapses.

682
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,041
Are you with me?

683
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:43,762
- Of course I am.
- Oh, good.

684
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,680
You and me, yes?

685
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,553
Kara?

686
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,430
What the devil
is she doing in here?

687
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,433
I don't know.
Kara, no, no.

688
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,311
I'm not telling you
another thing.

689
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,317
You announced it
in front of everybody.

690
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,820
I let my anger
get the best of me.

691
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:09,492
Kara!

692
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:10,993
Kara.

693
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,075
Kara, spit it out.
That's not food.

694
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,169
Spit it.

695
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,498
Kara, Kara, come here.

696
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:21,504
Look at me.
Give me your hand.

697
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:29,091
Okay, everyone.

698
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:31,142
♪ There's a storm blowing ♪

699
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:33,061
♪ A storm blowing ♪

700
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,263
You lied to me.

701
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:35,814
What's that?

702
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:45,149
- This is not the time.
- I trusted you.

703
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:46,859
Isabel, you have to be calm.

704
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:49,286
You didn't send them,
and you promised to help me.

705
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:51,785
You promised to help me,
and I believed you.

706
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,661
We can discuss this
at another time.

707
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,617
No, I need to see my daughter,

708
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,249
and this was going to get me
to see my daughter.

709
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,331
You will see your daughter,
I promise.

710
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,542
All you care about
is this absurd play!

711
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,548
- Stop now.
- You lied to me.

712
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:06,638
You lied to me!

713
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:07,800
You're delusional.

714
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,927
- I'm not delusional.
- You are.

715
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,134
I'm not mad!
I don't belong here!

716
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:13,514
- Orderlies!
- You know that!

717
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,436
- I don't belong here!
- Restrain her!

718
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:18,106
No! No, please!

719
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:23,233
I'm not mad! I'm not mad!
Please! No!

720
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:27,316
No! Let me go!
I want my daughter! Please!

721
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,527
Quite the little hellcat,
aren't we?

722
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:45,125
Can you guess what I found...

723
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,381
tucked beneath a pillow?

724
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,975
You're reading this
to our daughter?

725
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,677
This Cinderella?

726
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:59,223
Bring me my cane.

727
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:18,246
You bring this blasphemy
into my house?

728
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:19,918
A minister's house?

729
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,916
For a minister's daughter?

730
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:24,168
Your feet, dear wife.

731
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,611
The ship... tears on.

732
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,232
Say it.

733
00:47:58,459 --> 00:47:59,995
The ship tears on,

734
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:03,955
leaving such a furrow in the sea
as when a plowshare...

735
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:11,044
You will say it.

736
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,004
One way or another.

737
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:16,718
I hate that it's come to this.
You've left me no choice.

738
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:20,020
Say the lines.
Rejoin the cast.

739
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,769
If you continue to defy me,

740
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,276
I will be forced to...

741
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,084
Very well.

742
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,187
Say the lines, Isabel.

743
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:05,474
Go to hell.

744
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:23,250
Nurse Helga, put Mrs. Wallace
back in isolation.

745
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:41,055
Heart, soul, body, lungs,
and life is Ahab bound.

746
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,193
Damn me, thou actest right,
Captain.

747
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:51,360
My God.

748
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:53,359
You only have a few lines,

749
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:55,941
and you can't do better
than that?

750
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:02,372
You know, you begged me to be
in this play, remember?

751
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:05,246
I've told you a thousand times,
cue pickup.

752
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,669
Are you still foggy
on what that means?

753
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,121
No, sir.

754
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:12,504
Then why I am left waiting
for your lines to begin?

755
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:16,303
Do you know what happens while
you're gearing up for your cue?

756
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,754
Hmm?

757
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:21,182
The energy is dropping out
of the performance!

758
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,933
- Stupid bitch.
- Shh!

759
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,267
Say your lines.

760
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,899
Live in the game
and die in it.

761
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,905
He would've
shot me once.

762
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:42,912
Aye.

763
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:46,082
Powder in the pan.

764
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:48,660
Strange. These hands have
handled so many deadly lances,

765
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,497
yet now they shake.

766
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:56,460
Shall this crazed old man
be tamely suffered to drag...

767
00:50:56,554 --> 00:51:00,468
to drag a whole ship's company
down to doom with him?

768
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:03,767
There he is sleeping.

769
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:07,141
I but still alive
and soon awake.

770
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,314
- Do you see what she's doing?
- Stay in the moment.

771
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,891
He's supposed to be sleeping.

772
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:14,069
Cunt!
Stupid, stupid bitch!

773
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,362
I cannot withstand thee then,
old man.

774
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:20,067
Not reasoning, not entreaty
will thou harken to.

775
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,946
Fuck you, bitch!

776
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,122
I may yet survive to hug my wife
and child again.

777
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,165
Stupid, stupid bitch!

778
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:31,871
Great God, where art thou?
Shall I?

779
00:51:31,964 --> 00:51:35,503
Oh, Moby Dick!

780
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:39,212
I have you in my clutches
at last.

781
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,631
All right.

782
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,136
That was good, Matron,

783
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:45,933
except when you let her
distract you.

784
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,725
Hypocrite.

785
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,902
You accuse me
of being distracted,

786
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:57,445
and then you work
to distract me!

787
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,647
All right.

788
00:51:58,741 --> 00:51:59,982
Matron.

789
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,077
Beatrice Price.

790
00:52:09,168 --> 00:52:11,751
Benjamin Calhoun.

791
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,045
Was that how you rehearsed
at the Orpheum?

792
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,624
We didn't have matrons
or orderlies at the Orpheum.

793
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:21,428
When there's a crowd,
you know I'll perform.

794
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,757
When there's a crowd?

795
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:28,013
Should I start directing
when there's a crowd?

796
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,969
Oh, no, by all means,

797
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:32,681
start directing
whenever you feel the urge.

798
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:35,893
I direct.

799
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,649
Lest you forget,
we are in a loony bin,

800
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:42,278
and your cast
is comprised of madwomen.

801
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:45,111
You're a joke.
The whole play's a joke.

802
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:53,626
- Benjamin?
- Hmm?

803
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,456
I dared to hope.

804
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:02,260
But I swear, they're threatening
to tear my heart out.

805
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,096
Laudanum?

806
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,220
Just a few drops
to help me relax, Phoebe.

807
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,517
That's all.

808
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,855
Mmm.

809
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,688
They don't appreciate
what you're doing.

810
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:24,900
Your experiment will change
the study of lunacy forever.

811
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,581
What are you doing?

812
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:36,002
I am giving you a foot rub.

813
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,501
When I was a little girl,

814
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,832
and my daddy came home
from the lumberyards,

815
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,339
I would give him
a foot rub every night.

816
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:47,139
So I'm something of an expert.

817
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,716
But I don't need a foot rub.

818
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,723
Oh, my.

819
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,683
Oh, that's nice.

820
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:03,696
What would I do without you?

821
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,274
You're the only one
I can rely on.

822
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,530
You'd make do, I suppose.

823
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:14,829
Well, I try and try,

824
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:18,002
and they subvert me
at every turn.

825
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,672
Do they mean
to humiliate me?

826
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:29,474
Oh, my.

827
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:36,308
You didn't do that
for your father.

828
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,812
I didn't do this either.

829
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,000
Hello, Isabel.

830
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:15,219
I've invited your husband
to see you on opening night.

831
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,019
To see the progress
you have made.

832
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:21,357
He'll never come here.

833
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:25,274
On the contrary.

834
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:28,653
Your situation is
the talk of his congregation.

835
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,450
He knows he cannot ignore it
much longer, no.

836
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:37,290
He's bringing Rebecca.

837
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:44,873
Look. She was traumatized
by your arrest.

838
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:52,840
I told him to see you
on stage happy, healthy

839
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:54,799
will set her mind at ease.

840
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,556
Help her move forward.

841
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:03,396
Will you be my Ishmael again?

842
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,663
All right, Isabel,
whenever you're ready.

843
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:21,208
My pagan companion
and fast bosom-friend, Queequeg,

844
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:24,038
has been seized
with a fever.

845
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:25,497
Poor Queequeg.

846
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:30,131
He quietly lays in his hammock.

847
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,337
The rolling sea
seems to be gently rocking him

848
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:34,514
to his final rest.

849
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,807
- An awe seizes...
- Kara.

850
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:38,510
Stop that.

851
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:41,847
You're supposed to be
half-dead.

852
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,147
Go on.

853
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,020
An awe seizes over me

854
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:49,730
as I sit by this waning savage

855
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,940
to the drawing near Death,

856
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,321
which alike levels all.

857
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:03,626
What is it you think we're doing
here, Deirdre?

858
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:05,999
Playing some sort of game?

859
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,581
Dressing up like sailormen

860
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:12,089
and pretending
to chase a whale?

861
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:14,421
You move like frightened women.

862
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:20,761
Have none of you coiled rope
before?

863
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,937
No?

864
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:24,480
Let me show you.

865
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:29,357
I want manly strength.

866
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,029
You see that?
Manly strength.

867
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:36,735
I want manly strength,
not girlish prancing.

868
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,791
Let me see it again.

869
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:50,415
Are you stupid
as you are crazy?

870
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,877
Orderly, deal with her.

871
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,133
Take her.

872
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:12,647
I was watching male patients
on work detail the other day,

873
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:16,107
hauling casks and crates.

874
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:21,663
They moved
with such easy strength,

875
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:25,082
such innate virility.

876
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:31,881
I see not a whit of that
in our cast.

877
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:39,465
You have been making
a noble effort, Phoebe.

878
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:43,518
Price is good
when she decides to be.

879
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:48,223
But you cannot rid yourselves
of your cursed femininity.

880
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:55,063
Well, we're just women.

881
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:56,648
Yes.

882
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,949
Perhaps that's the problem.

883
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:30,898
They're putting
men's blood in us.

884
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:55,777
She's seizing!
She's seizing!

885
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:56,882
Kara!

886
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,755
Get her feet!

887
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:35,288
I'm an actor.

888
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:37,590
You cast me as a man,
and I'll give you a man.

889
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:41,386
You cast me as a sea captain,
and I'll give you a sea captain.

890
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,885
You cast me as Ahab,

891
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:47,308
and by God,
I will give you Ahab

892
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,602
without the benefit
of his blood.

893
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:52,897
Get off!
Off! Get off!

894
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:59,566
Put her in the chair.

895
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:00,614
Is everything all right?

896
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,447
Everything's fine.

897
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,985
We lost a patient.

898
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,368
No procedure
is without its risks.

899
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:12,450
Matron Stokes, you will
be receiving the blood treatment

900
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:14,080
like the rest of patients.

901
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:19,962
- What?
- If you want to be in my cast,

902
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:22,964
you will behave like a man.

903
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,421
Dr. Calhoun, you overstep.

904
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,427
I am the head matron
at this facility,

905
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:29,053
not one of your patients,

906
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:32,137
and I will not be receiving
any sort of treatment.

907
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,938
I am truly disappointed.

908
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:40,896
I thought you were
committed to this.

909
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:44,903
But now I can see
you're just as weak as them.

910
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,071
No!

911
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:00,633
No!

912
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:29,694
Beatrice!

913
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,072
All right, let's begin with
the Queequeg scene, shall we?

914
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,208
All right, I realize
that we've lost Kara.

915
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:23,961
It's unfortunate.

916
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:27,088
We will have to recast.
All right, Mrs. Wallace,

917
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:30,512
I've changed the dialogue
for Queequeg to narration.

918
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,182
Your treatment killed her.

919
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:34,304
Come now!

920
01:03:34,394 --> 01:03:36,351
There is no connection,
all right?

921
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:38,020
She's prone to seizures.

922
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:40,098
- Where's Beatrice?
- She's not in this scene.

923
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:43,355
Griselda, would you mind
filling in for Kara for today?

924
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:46,279
Let's get you in here.

925
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:47,946
There you go.

926
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,338
Queequeg told me it is the
custom of his race

927
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:06,666
to stretch out
a dead warrior in a canoe

928
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,922
and let him float away.

929
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:12,505
He shudders at the thought
of being buried in his hammock,

930
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,636
as is the custom at sea.

931
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:15,684
Wait, please.

932
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:24,274
I'm not feeling
your sorrow, Isabel.

933
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:26,569
Surely this is
an opportunity for you

934
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:30,398
to channel your feelings
for Kara, you know?

935
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:32,529
You're thinking too much.

936
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:33,700
Don't think.

937
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:36,325
Feel. Feel.

938
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,951
Feel.

939
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:44,370
Carry on.

940
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:47,548
He recalls that he has seen
dead sailors in Nantucket

941
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,591
laid to rest in canoes.

942
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:53,921
He means coffins.
And he desires one for himself.

943
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:57,679
If I may...

944
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:01,183
you're watching your friend
slowly waste away.

945
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:07,644
How does it make you feel?

946
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,445
Fear?

947
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:13,366
Grief?

948
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,864
Anger?

949
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:19,618
There's something
burning inside.

950
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:20,948
Hmm?

951
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:23,034
How much does it hurt?

952
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,293
A lot.

953
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:32,839
Show me a lot.

954
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:46,521
The ship's carpenter took
his measure and went to work.

955
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:50,353
Now the last nail
has been driven.

956
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:54,031
Queequeg entreats to be lifted
into his final bed,

957
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:56,404
along with his harpoon.

958
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:01,531
Are those tears?

959
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,668
Ishmael is a man!

960
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:08,165
You understand?

961
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:11,294
Men do not show their grief
in that manner!

962
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:14,001
Blast it, women! I mean,
do we need another transfusion?

963
01:06:14,095 --> 01:06:15,455
Is that what we want?

964
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,755
Do you want
another transfusion, huh?

965
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,096
Show me some masculinity
like Phoebe!

966
01:06:22,187 --> 01:06:25,100
That's what I need!
Now, now...

967
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,682
some of you sailors
will lift up Queequeg

968
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,983
into his lovely coffin
that I've had made,

969
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:33,107
but for now, Griselda, let's get
you in the coffin, come on.

970
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:35,301
- I'd rather not.
- No, no, no, it's okay.

971
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:37,282
It's nonsense.
This is just make-believe.

972
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:39,530
There it is. Wonderful.

973
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:41,487
Manly strength.
Manly strength. Go.

974
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:43,493
Isabel, come down,
say your lines.

975
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,743
Come down and say your lines!

976
01:06:47,795 --> 01:06:49,752
Queequeg is placed
in the coffin.

977
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,080
He lies without moving,

978
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:52,540
his arms crossed over
his breast...

979
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:54,296
Out here, out here.

980
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:55,945
while the coffin lid
is placed over him,

981
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:59,050
- and the sails...
- Ah!

982
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,928
Our Ahab has returned to us.

983
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:07,642
Are you ready to return
to the fold, Beatrice?

984
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:13,690
One condition.

985
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:21,995
You get Edward Fry...
to attend,

986
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:25,118
and I'll perform.

987
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:28,952
I would love Edward Fry
to come.

988
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,038
But how do you expect me
to do that?

989
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:34,999
Just mention my name.

990
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:53,893
Mr. Fry?

991
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:56,479
Excuse me, sir.
Please stay back.

992
01:07:56,573 --> 01:07:58,109
Can I speak to Mr. Fry?

993
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:01,408
Mr. Fry's a busy man.
Please move along.

994
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:42,320
Yeah! Yeah!

995
01:08:58,426 --> 01:08:59,917
Mr. Fry, good evening, sir.

996
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:01,673
My name is Dr. Benjamin Calhoun.

997
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,657
I'd like to talk to you
about a theatrical endeavor.

998
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:05,343
Excuse me!

999
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:06,952
- Not tonight, all right?
- I would like to have a word.

1000
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:09,889
- Jeremy.
- Yeah?

1001
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,767
- A wager on Lizzy.
- Of course.

1002
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:14,189
To lose.

1003
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,559
Very good, sir.

1004
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:19,611
- If I could have a moment...
- I don't think so.

1005
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:23,281
- It's just a...
- Listen, nothing tonight, okay?

1006
01:09:23,368 --> 01:09:24,984
Of course, yes, yes, yes.

1007
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:28,116
I am mounting a play
at the asylum where I work.

1008
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:29,742
Mr. Fry does not...

1009
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,368
Would you get your hands
off of me?

1010
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:32,540
Ow! Ow!

1011
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,243
I have Beatrice Price!

1012
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,751
You have Beatrice Price?

1013
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,707
Yes.

1014
01:09:40,802 --> 01:09:42,418
On stage?

1015
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:45,929
All right, Isabel,

1016
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,551
please give us the lines

1017
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:50,009
that describe
Queequeg's resurrection.

1018
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:59,477
Queequeg suddenly rallies
and is half-well within a day.

1019
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:03,735
He leaps to his feet,
stretches his arms and legs, yawns

1020
01:10:03,825 --> 01:10:06,067
and finds himself fit for a
fight.

1021
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:09,073
He begins to use his coffin
as a sea chest.

1022
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,206
Here they are.

1023
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:14,783
Dr. Calhoun, everyone.

1024
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:15,877
Yes.

1025
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:18,495
A distinguished guest.

1026
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:22,542
Beatrice

1027
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:25,218
Come here.

1028
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,760
Let me look at you.

1029
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:32,013
You left me here.

1030
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:37,811
Beatrice, I tried,
but you committed murder.

1031
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:41,359
We saved your life
by declaring you insane.

1032
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:43,233
Mr. Fry.

1033
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,484
Good to see you, sir.

1034
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:47,032
Al...

1035
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:49,701
Please don't let me interrupt.
Continue.

1036
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,779
Oh, yes. We were just about
to start rehearsing

1037
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:55,082
the "Captain, my captain" scene.

1038
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:59,162
Uh, Isabel,
whenever you are ready.

1039
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:03,923
The ship tears on,

1040
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,797
leaving such a furrow
in the sea

1041
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:08,470
as when a ploughshare
churns up a field.

1042
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:12,049
Stand close to me,
Starbuck.

1043
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:14,851
Let
me look into a human eye.

1044
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:18,351
It Is better
than to gaze upon God.

1045
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:22,401
I can see my wife and child
in thine eye.

1046
01:11:22,487 --> 01:11:25,446
Captain, my captain,

1047
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:28,194
noble soul,
grand old heart after all.

1048
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:31,948
What cruel,
remorseless emperor commands me

1049
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:35,782
that against
all natural longings,

1050
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:39,459
I so keep pushing recklessly,

1051
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:42,458
making me ready to do

1052
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:47,088
what in my own natural heart
I durst not dare?

1053
01:11:47,178 --> 01:11:52,094
Is Ahab, Ahab?

1054
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:58,851
Is it I, God, or who
that lifts this arm?

1055
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:12,953
Remarkable.

1056
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:18,998
Do you have any comments,
Mr. Fry?

1057
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:22,035
No, not at all,

1058
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:25,748
but I'd appreciate a moment
alone with Miss Price.

1059
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:27,959
Well, however we can
accommodate you.

1060
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:32,638
Would everyone except Beatrice
please clear the room?

1061
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:36,592
I'd like you to meet
Mrs. Isabel Wallace.

1062
01:12:36,686 --> 01:12:40,145
She has all the makings
of a true actress.

1063
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:43,224
Mrs. Wallace, I'm charmed.

1064
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:46,685
Yes, Mrs. Wallace
has been doing remarkable.

1065
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,486
I've really been
working with her.

1066
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:51,657
Call me Isabel.

1067
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:53,984
Would you care to join us?

1068
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:57,533
- Doctor.
- Yes?

1069
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,205
We'll fetch you shortly.

1070
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:02,410
You wish for me to leave
as well?

1071
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:06,042
Come, come, Calhoun.
Let the artists have a moment.

1072
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,212
Yes, of course.

1073
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:25,395
Benjamin.

1074
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,350
Benjamin, please,
get ahold of yourself.

1075
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:31,610
Do you have any idea
what this could mean?

1076
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:35,283
Listen, I admit I was
skeptical at first,

1077
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:37,281
but Edward Fry?

1078
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:42,491
The famous theatrical
impresario in the flesh.

1079
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:46,795
Do you have any idea
how many wealthy patrons?

1080
01:13:46,881 --> 01:13:51,467
New York, Boston,
he has them in his pocket.

1081
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:54,920
With his support,
we could reach new donors,

1082
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:56,596
wealthy sponsors.

1083
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:58,173
Benjamin, please,

1084
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:02,807
it could lead to advanced
equipment, facilities.

1085
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:06,356
You must do everything you can
to keep his interest,

1086
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,274
do you hear me?

1087
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,202
It's been too long.

1088
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:21,496
God knows what they are
getting up to in there.

1089
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:23,494
Benjamin, no!
Benjamin!

1090
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,827
Dr. Calhoun.

1091
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:32,003
The women were just
telling me all about you.

1092
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:34,426
Please have a seat.

1093
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:49,145
What you are doing here...

1094
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:50,976
is bold.

1095
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:54,188
Revolutionary.

1096
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:55,692
By accident, I suspect,

1097
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:59,276
as I doubt alone
you had the vision

1098
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:01,783
to cast all the roles
with women.

1099
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:04,831
However...

1100
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:09,002
this play has the potential
to be sensual,

1101
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:10,374
provocative,

1102
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:11,955
transcendent even.

1103
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:15,338
With two radiant women
at its core,

1104
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:17,135
all good fortune to you.

1105
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:23,971
So I've decided to offer
my patronage.

1106
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:27,179
That means an audience,

1107
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,014
publicity,

1108
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:34,149
and potential funding
for future endeavors.

1109
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:36,104
Furthermore,

1110
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:40,909
I will host the performance
at my own Palace Theater.

1111
01:15:40,995 --> 01:15:44,329
Oh, Mr. Fry, that would be...

1112
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:46,657
Naturally,
there are some conditions.

1113
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:51,416
First, Beatrice will
take over all staging,

1114
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:53,588
blocking
and choreography.

1115
01:15:56,052 --> 01:16:00,797
Oh, uhh, that sounds
like you mean

1116
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,802
for her to direct
the entire play.

1117
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:05,600
Yes, that's right!

1118
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:07,928
But we'll still use your fine
script.

1119
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:12,392
The only reason
Beatrice Price isn't recognized

1120
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:15,649
as one of the great
directors of our time

1121
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:17,070
is that the world of theater

1122
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:22,072
is plagued by envy-ridden
misogynists.

1123
01:16:22,161 --> 01:16:24,528
Now, Mr. Fry, with all due resp...

1124
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:26,579
I'm not finished.

1125
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:33,795
Monomania seized him.

1126
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:38,342
Isn't that what Melville
wrote about Ahab?

1127
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:42,717
You have lost your way,
Dr. Calhoun.

1128
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:47,723
Now the only way to succeed
is to turn over your play

1129
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:50,350
to surer hands.

1130
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,897
Dr. Withers, I trust
there are no objections.

1131
01:16:56,195 --> 01:16:57,902
None whatsoever.

1132
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:01,732
Great.
Jeremy will come every day

1133
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:06,412
to ensure that things proceed
as I've describe.

1134
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:09,490
I'll expect regular reports.

1135
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:13,831
Good day, ladies,
and good luck.

1136
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:24,678
You women!

1137
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:27,633
Where is your loyalty?

1138
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:29,718
Transcendent? Provocative?

1139
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:32,350
I wrote this!

1140
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:36,308
Surely, Mr. Melville
deserves some of the credit.

1141
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:49,825
You're still in, aren't you?

1142
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:54,501
I'm still in.
Of course.

1143
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:58,456
It's my only way
of seeing Rebecca..

1144
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:04,127
But then what?

1145
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:08,135
She sees me on stage
with madwomen, the play ends,

1146
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:12,060
she goes home,
and I'm still trapped here.

1147
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:16,607
This play could be our way out.

1148
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:21,645
We have to leave the grounds
to perform.

1149
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:26,530
I'm orchestrating
all the action.

1150
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:30,954
All eyes will be
turned toward the stage.

1151
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:35,874
We escape?

1152
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,121
Exactly.

1153
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:44,376
Edward will support us,

1154
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:46,427
provide us
with means of departure.

1155
01:18:46,513 --> 01:18:50,553
What about Rebecca?
I can't leave her with him.

1156
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:54,557
We can figure that out too.

1157
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:58,482
I never told anyone
why my husband put me here.

1158
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:03,687
Every year,
Tobias buys a brand-new cane.

1159
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,863
He tests them on me.

1160
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:18,869
Always in places nobody sees.

1161
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:56,493
You wouldn't dare.

1162
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:59,826
Hit me in the face,
you coward.

1163
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,003
Strike me where
everyone can see.

1164
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:09,345
- Stop it!
- No!

1165
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:10,796
- Stop it!
- Do it! Do it!

1166
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:12,881
Hit me in the face!

1167
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:15,550
Do it!

1168
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:26,603
Madwoman.

1169
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,119
You're not mad.

1170
01:20:41,462 --> 01:20:45,502
Your husband is.
Just like mine was.

1171
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:51,920
We did what we had to do.

1172
01:21:01,482 --> 01:21:03,690
Happens all too often.

1173
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:08,817
Artists, visionaries
die unknown.

1174
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:26,416
<i>Benjamin Calhoun.</i>

1175
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:31,168
<i>It's women
or nothing.</i>

1176
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,877
Who's there?

1177
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:36,089
<i>All you care about
is this absurd play.</i>

1178
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:38,641
<i>Benjamin,
we're just women.</i>

1179
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,389
<i>Benjamin.</i>

1180
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:43,768
<i>Whosoever of ye raises me
a white-headed whale...</i>

1181
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:47,316
<i>You're a joke.
The whole play is a joke.</i>

1182
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:50,979
<i>We are in a loony bin</i>

1183
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:54,612
<i>and your cast
is comprised of madwomen.</i>

1184
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:56,943
You're dead, whale.

1185
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:01,789
From hell's heart,
I stab at thee.

1186
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:05,956
<i>Surely,
Mr. Melville deserves</i>

1187
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:07,046
<i>some of the credit too.</i>

1188
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,335
As dawn broke,

1189
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:17,764
Ahab could be seen
staring out at sea.

1190
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:22,515
Oh, what a lovely day.

1191
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:28,100
A fair day could not dawn
upon the world.

1192
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,651
Here's a thought.

1193
01:22:30,737 --> 01:22:34,447
What if Ahab
had time to think?

1194
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:37,571
But Ahab never thinks.

1195
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:39,903
He only feels.

1196
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:42,410
Feels, feels!

1197
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:45,242
To think would be audacity.

1198
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:49,045
God only has that right
and privilege.

1199
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:51,088
Our poor hearts throb

1200
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:54,714
and our poor brains
beat too much for that.

1201
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:57,045
There she blows!

1202
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:01,515
With a hump like a snow hill!

1203
01:23:01,602 --> 01:23:03,889
'Tis Moby Dick!
Did none of you see it first?

1204
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,392
I saw him
the same instant you did!

1205
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:09,225
- Ready the boats!
- There she breaches!

1206
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:17,861
Wondrous phenomenon!

1207
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:21,115
Rising with utmost velocity
from the furthest depths,

1208
01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:26,417
the whale booms his entire bulk
into the pure element of air.

1209
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:29,961
Do you feel brave,
my hearties?

1210
01:23:30,047 --> 01:23:33,256
Aye!
Brave as fearless fire!

1211
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:36,426
Keep pulling!
Lower those boats!

1212
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:39,050
In Jesus' name,
no more of this!

1213
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:41,506
It is worse than
devil's madness!

1214
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,592
Never wilt thou capture
Moby Dick.

1215
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:46,974
Yea, I'll ten times girdle
the unmeasured

1216
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:48,976
globe and dive
straight through it,

1217
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:51,058
but I'll slay him yet.

1218
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:53,894
Shall we keep chasing
this murderous fish

1219
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:56,775
till we be dragged to
the infernal bottom of the sea?

1220
01:23:56,865 --> 01:24:00,825
Some men die at ebb tide,

1221
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:02,777
some at low water,

1222
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:06,160
some at the full of the flood.

1223
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,788
Shake hands with me, man!

1224
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:16,633
O captain, my captain.
noble heart, go not.

1225
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:24,349
One and... Steady.

1226
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:25,970
Great.

1227
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:29,304
Okay, now my rowers,
on my count.

1228
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:36,398
It's to the one and two
and one and right and...

1229
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:39,857
Yes! It's looking good, ladies.

1230
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:41,987
Are you ready, Matron?

1231
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:46,242
The boats dart forward
to attack.

1232
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:49,870
All paddles plying
with rippling swiftness.

1233
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,503
Look out! Keep thou keenest eye
on the boat

1234
01:25:01,597 --> 01:25:02,963
and mark well the whale.

1235
01:25:03,056 --> 01:25:05,719
They are nearing their foe.

1236
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:08,643
The entire dazzling hump
is distinctly visible,

1237
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:13,019
and the glistening shadow
of the broad, milky forehead

1238
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,100
of the unsuspecting prey.

1239
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:26,239
And... nice.

1240
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:29,619
Not perfect,
but maybe we can use that.

1241
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:31,165
I like it.

1242
01:25:31,251 --> 01:25:34,790
And, um, Mr. Starbuck,
if you please.

1243
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,248
Through the serene tranquil,
tropical sea,

1244
01:25:38,342 --> 01:25:39,878
the glorious white moves on...

1245
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,925
Stop.

1246
01:25:42,012 --> 01:25:43,753
What are you doing?

1247
01:25:43,847 --> 01:25:46,931
Those are Ishmael's lines.
Why is Starbuck telling it?

1248
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:50,431
Ishmael is busy
on a whaling boat.

1249
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,388
Mr. Starbuck is standing
on the <i>Pequod,</i> watching.

1250
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:54,848
It makes sense.

1251
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:59,151
Fry suggested
you choreograph the action.

1252
01:25:59,237 --> 01:26:02,571
He didn't say you could
rewrite my script

1253
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:04,115
and massacre Melville.

1254
01:26:04,201 --> 01:26:05,567
The script is set.

1255
01:26:07,537 --> 01:26:08,537
Matron Stokes?

1256
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:13,287
I think it's a huge improvement.

1257
01:26:13,377 --> 01:26:17,291
Please, sir,
why don't you have a seat

1258
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:19,543
and allow the ladies
to work, huh?

1259
01:26:25,097 --> 01:26:29,512
Through the serene tranquilities
of the tropical sea,

1260
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:32,139
the glorified white whale
moves on.

1261
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:34,563
Beautiful.

1262
01:26:34,648 --> 01:26:39,689
Slow, graceful.

1263
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:41,735
Love it. Very feminine.

1264
01:26:41,822 --> 01:26:43,609
This is a travesty.

1265
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:47,318
The whale is male.
The sailors are male.

1266
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:49,573
There is no room in the story
for femininity.

1267
01:26:49,663 --> 01:26:51,074
You're destroying everything!

1268
01:26:51,164 --> 01:26:54,874
Sir, I should hate
to report to Mr. Fry

1269
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,953
that you held up rehearsals.

1270
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:11,892
Thank you.

1271
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:13,718
More lines for me.

1272
01:27:17,107 --> 01:27:20,771
Okay, from the beginning,
everyone.

1273
01:27:20,861 --> 01:27:22,693
I have news from Mr. Fry.

1274
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:26,363
One of his vessels will be
sailing from New Bedford soon.

1275
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:29,989
He has delayed its departure.

1276
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:31,410
Yeah.

1277
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:39,501
Um, okay, everybody ready?

1278
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:43,878
We open in three days.

1279
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:45,833
From the top!

1280
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:54,343
They come expecting
a freak show,

1281
01:27:54,436 --> 01:27:59,477
but we shall show them
a theatrical spectacle.

1282
01:27:59,566 --> 01:28:02,274
A grand adventure!

1283
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,898
We have weathered
many storms together.

1284
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:10,074
Our voyage beset with perils
from within...

1285
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,822
and without.

1286
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:18,954
But we have persevered!

1287
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:21,536
A dead whale or a stove boat.

1288
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:27,926
A dead whale or a stove boat!

1289
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:31,129
Yes, Doctor, we have it.

1290
01:28:31,223 --> 01:28:33,715
We're as ready
as we'll ever be.

1291
01:28:33,809 --> 01:28:35,926
Okay, let's get you all
backstage.

1292
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:43,016
He's the maddest one
out of all of us.

1293
01:28:44,528 --> 01:28:45,528
Oh, Isabel.

1294
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:51,323
If I may, uh...

1295
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:56,371
I know it's been rocky
between us of late.

1296
01:28:58,124 --> 01:29:02,289
But I, I feel
we had something special,

1297
01:29:02,379 --> 01:29:06,965
and I'd like to get back to that
when this is over.

1298
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:11,169
So for my next production,

1299
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:13,721
I want you to be
my Cleopatra.

1300
01:29:15,976 --> 01:29:17,558
Okay!

1301
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:27,651
Welcome. Please, please
take your seats.

1302
01:29:27,737 --> 01:29:30,195
Ha ha!
There you are, Calhoun.

1303
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:33,571
- This is amazing.
- It's great to have you.

1304
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:36,744
Thank you.
Please take your seat. Yes, yes.

1305
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:38,241
It's great to be here.

1306
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:53,344
Beatrice? Beatrice.

1307
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:55,717
I don't think I can do it.

1308
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:58,675
Relax, Everything is arranged.

1309
01:29:58,768 --> 01:30:01,049
I don't want to hear another
word out of that pretty mouth

1310
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:04,814
until I hear you say,
"Call me, Ishmael."

1311
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,061
Yes?

1312
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:08,313
Hello, young lady.

1313
01:30:08,403 --> 01:30:10,315
This your first time
in the theater?

1314
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:11,737
Yes, sir.

1315
01:30:11,823 --> 01:30:14,315
We do not frequent
these types of events.

1316
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:17,698
- We're churchgoing folk.
- Ah.

1317
01:30:17,787 --> 01:30:20,951
Well, the theater is my church.

1318
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:27,537
It's like magic.
You'll see.

1319
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:35,302
Oh, my God.

1320
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:37,880
What is this
that shoots through me?

1321
01:30:37,974 --> 01:30:40,466
All my past
has somehow grown dim.

1322
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,268
Is my journey's end coming?

1323
01:30:43,355 --> 01:30:46,189
The grand god reveals himself!

1324
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:50,735
Aye! Reach your last
to the sun, Moby Dick!

1325
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:55,690
Thy hour and thy harpoon
are at hand!

1326
01:30:55,784 --> 01:31:00,370
For hate's sake,
I spit my last breath at thee!

1327
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:04,369
From hell's heart,
I stab at thee!

1328
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,997
The spear is darted!
Ahab's line runs foul.

1329
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:08,328
It's caught around his neck!

1330
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:13,090
The whale wheels around,

1331
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:15,509
bears down the <i>Pequod's</i>
advancing prow.

1332
01:31:18,223 --> 01:31:21,967
All is set. Mr. Fry's carriage
awaits in the back alley.

1333
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:23,801
I'm going to go check
on Rebecca again.

1334
01:31:23,895 --> 01:31:24,895
Okay.

1335
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,732
Think you can escape now, huh?

1336
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:37,657
Don't you know?
They all think you're mad.

1337
01:31:37,742 --> 01:31:39,984
You'll never leave.
No, no, no.

1338
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:42,570
You're going to stay here
with me until you die.

1339
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:44,121
Let go of her!

1340
01:31:58,304 --> 01:32:01,217
The whale!
My God, stand by me now!

1341
01:32:18,408 --> 01:32:21,071
Water pours from
the breach in our side.

1342
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:23,823
We are doomed.

1343
01:32:40,513 --> 01:32:41,879
I did it.

1344
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,517
I did it.

1345
01:32:50,607 --> 01:32:52,690
You can still go.

1346
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:55,980
Isabel, help me.

1347
01:32:57,864 --> 01:33:00,151
Isabel, grab his leg.

1348
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:01,357
Okay.

1349
01:33:03,995 --> 01:33:06,112
- Arms on three.
- Okay.

1350
01:33:06,206 --> 01:33:08,118
Ready? One, two...

1351
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:22,006
You're supposed to be
on stage. Go.

1352
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:23,097
No.

1353
01:33:23,098 --> 01:33:25,181
Go. Finish the play.

1354
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:28,930
Isabel, if you don't go now,
they'll know something's wrong.

1355
01:33:48,414 --> 01:33:50,371
The drama is done.

1356
01:33:54,212 --> 01:33:56,545
Why then does one step forth?

1357
01:33:58,091 --> 01:34:00,674
Because one did survive
the wreck.

1358
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:04,299
Take the coffin. Steady.
All the crew, were carried out of sight

1359
01:34:04,389 --> 01:34:06,301
Go, go.
to the depths of the ocean.

1360
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:09,805
Floating on the margin
and in sight of the wreck,

1361
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:13,808
I was slowly drawn
towards the vortex.

1362
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:19,150
Queequeg's coffin!

1363
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:21,820
I grasped onto it...

1364
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:26,617
and was buoyed up by that coffin
for one day and one night.

1365
01:34:29,956 --> 01:34:32,073
On the second day,
a sail drew near

1366
01:34:32,167 --> 01:34:34,910
and picked me up at last.

1367
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:39,043
Then the great shroud of the sea
rolled on...

1368
01:34:42,635 --> 01:34:46,470
as it has rolled on
for 5,000 years.

1369
01:35:02,363 --> 01:35:04,480
Enjoy your moment.

1370
01:35:04,574 --> 01:35:06,440
You earned it.

1371
01:36:13,017 --> 01:36:15,100
Mother! Mother!

1372
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:17,303
Rebecca! Come here!
Mother!

1373
01:36:17,397 --> 01:36:18,933
- No!
- Mother! Mother!

1374
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:21,106
Let the girl
be with her mother.

1375
01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:23,604
Rebecca!

1376
01:36:40,503 --> 01:36:43,120
Beatrice! Isabel!

1377
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:48,467
Go.

1378
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:55,720
Hey! Hey, get back here!

1379
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:07,607
I did it! I killed him!

1380
01:37:07,697 --> 01:37:09,984
He deserved to die!

1381
01:37:10,074 --> 01:37:11,440
Hey, hey!

1382
01:37:11,534 --> 01:37:13,321
- To arms, ladies!
- Yes!

1383
01:37:13,411 --> 01:37:15,243
Rebecca! Rebecca!

1384
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:16,446
Where is he?

1385
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:18,121
Rebecca, I said get back...

1386
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:26,330
Hey!

1387
01:37:29,927 --> 01:37:32,010
Cocksucker! Cunt!

1388
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:34,513
Let go!

1389
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:42,722
Beatrice, what have you done?

1390
01:37:46,402 --> 01:37:49,236
To the docks.
Mr. Fry's boat.

1391
01:37:51,366 --> 01:37:52,366
Thank you.

1392
01:37:56,287 --> 01:37:58,620
I got to die on stage.

1393
01:38:00,375 --> 01:38:03,618
Beatrice.
Oh, Beatrice.

1394
01:38:15,181 --> 01:38:18,015
Where are we going, Mother?

1395
01:38:18,101 --> 01:38:22,436
Out to sea,
like the men in the play.

1396
01:38:22,522 --> 01:38:24,935
Will there be a whale?

1397
01:38:27,193 --> 01:38:28,809
I doubt it.

1398
01:38:30,696 --> 01:38:34,189
Everyone says you're mad.

1399
01:38:34,283 --> 01:38:37,276
Are you?

1400
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:38,577
Look at me.

1401
01:38:41,249 --> 01:38:45,960
When everyone says something,
it doesn't always make it true.

1402
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:55,760
I don't think you're mad.
