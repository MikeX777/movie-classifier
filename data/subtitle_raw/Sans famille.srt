1
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,630
London

2
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,960
Be careful!

3
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,670
Is that Lady Milligan's brother?

4
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,390
No, that is her son-in-law, the brother of the deceased.

5
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,640
He can barely stand on his feet.
Is it because of grief?

6
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,360
What do you think?

7
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,030
It's because of the whiskey.
It washes away a joyful event.

8
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,430
Is he an heir?

9
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,720
Eh, no. With him, the inheritance will not last long.

10
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,900
No, the heir is little Robert, the lord's son.

11
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,960
Poor child.

12
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,630
He doesn't want to touch any of these toys.

13
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,290
It's as if understands what's happened.

14
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,270
Well, Robert, let's go eat.

15
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,820
Grandmother!

16
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,740
Robert... Robert, darling!

17
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,510
Robert, my baby!

18
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,180
Mr. James called, madam.

19
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,850
He asks you not to wait for him for dinner, he has an important meeting.

20
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,870
Very well.

21
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,420
Robert...

22
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,740
Nothing stirs up hunger like a funeral!

23
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,220
How many of them have I seen in my life?

24
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,450
One like this? Never!

25
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,800
And the procession?
Did you see how they walked?

26
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,770
That's enough. I need to talk to you.

27
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,610
Really?

28
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,590
I know that remorse doesn’t choke you.

29
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,070
Oh, you say so because one day in the bank,

30
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,180
you caught my hand on your wallet?

31
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,850
But anyone can make a mistake like that!

32
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,660
- I could have put you in jail.
- Yes.

33
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,500
But pretended to be nearsighted instead

34
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,000
to carefully study my criminal record.

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,260
I want to offer you a job.

36
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,420
Work?

37
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,540
And well paid.

38
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,780
You?

39
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,050
Do you know that my brother left a great fortune?

40
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,270
Yes, but not for you. To his son.

41
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,640
Precisely.

42
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,400
The child's room is on the second floor.

43
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,020
I'll arrange it so that the servants are gone.

44
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,570
As you can see, nothing could be easier!

45
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,960
Yes, nothing could be easier...

46
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,960
But if I get caught...

47
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:04,860
- Monsieur, would you like to dance?
- Leave me alone!

48
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,750
Oh, how rude!

49
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,070
Oh, come on, I'm tired of your stories!

50
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,670
It is enough to be cautious.

51
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,330
Cautious?

52
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,770
Yeah, and when they catch me...

53
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,380
Then it won't be enough.

54
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,170
Tell me, patron, have you seen my husband?

55
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:20,750
There.

56
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,670
Oh! Who would doubt it?

57
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,300
Sitting and calming himself with an aperitif.

58
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,300
Give me something.

59
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,300
No, I tell you, I don't like it.

60
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,050
I like working in pockets.

61
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,940
How much do you say?

62
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,870
No, I will not accept it.
It's too dangerous.

63
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,970
I assure you there is no risk!

64
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,160
Who's talking about risk here?
Where is the risk?

65
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,540
- Why?
- There's just not enough here!

66
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,980
No, no, woman, no, no!

67
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,320
This monsieur is telling me about games and about...

68
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,980
about the Grand Prix at the races.

69
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,510
You want to spend all your money on the races?

70
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,910
Like you have enough for that!

71
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,440
You already let everything go!
Now we have nothing!

72
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,920
Listen, go cry in your yard.
Leave me alone.

73
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,480
Cry, cry!
You won't get anything from me!

74
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,240
Yes, Yes! Leave us!

75
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,160
What a character!
Oh, these women!

76
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,160
Yes, well, so there...

77
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,110
Oh no! I will not accept it! I already told you this job is not for me!

78
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,810
Well, now!

79
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,180
Since you're being so sentimental...

80
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,750
Deal?

81
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,650
What a charmer you are!

82
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,410
Robert!

83
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,080
Madame!

84
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,080
Madame! Madame!
The baby is gone!

85
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,140
What did you say?

86
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,110
Are you sure?

87
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,360
It's incomprehensible!
We need to call them immediately!

88
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,030
Yes.

89
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,840
Yes, Mr. James.

90
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,210
Tonight.

91
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,100
Lady Milligan was distraught with grief.

92
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,630
She asked to tell you immediately.

93
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,440
Yes, yes, of course, I'm coming.

94
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,070
What a story!

95
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,550
I hope you informed the police?

96
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,590
Yes, I will leave immediately.

97
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,270
You little brat!

98
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,650
Did your buddies keep you warm?

99
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,840
Poor fellow!
With such an angelic smile!

100
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,130
Don't worry.
You will soon meet the angels.

101
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,710
How cute!

102
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,770
Yes, but still!

103
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,520
And anyway, I'm doing you a favor.

104
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,230
After all, life is essentially a sad thing.

105
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,630
But what will the client say?

106
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,330
And he won't know anything.

107
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,020
But murder goes against my principles!

108
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:00,430
Oh, to hell with morality.
You're too cute.

109
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,290
Maybe someday you will reproach me for this.

110
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,290
You will not end up in the ground.

111
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,910
You will live!

112
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,300
So much the worse for you!

113
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,300
Well, now, now he is whimpering!

114
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,920
And you have no suspicions?

115
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,440
No, no, Mr. Commissioner.

116
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,740
You cannot give us any information,

117
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,990
about anyone who could help us find a motive?

118
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,260
None, Mr. Commissioner.

119
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,400
In any case, we will warn all the London police stations.

120
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,300
There is nothing else we can do.

121
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,680
Ah, doctor!

122
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,680
Well, so far all the searches have yielded no results.

123
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,130
Above all, you mustn't deprive Lady Milligan of her last hope.

124
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,460
In her position, strong emotions can be fatal.

125
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,920
- What?
- Yes.

126
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,920
Lady Milligan is expecting a baby.

127
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,820
Lady Milligan?
Another child?

128
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:07,440
10 Years Later
In Chavanon, a small village in southern France

129
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,680
Rémi! Rémi!

130
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,120
I'm coming!

131
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,440
And I tell you that this brute is completely stunted.

132
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,140
Stunted? My Roussette?
She never got sick at all.

133
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,040
She eats nothing, but is stronger than a horse.

134
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,150
Okay, I know that you are embarrassed.
I will not abuse it.

135
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,610
Oh, Mother Barberin!
Roussette!

136
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,850
Say goodbye to her my little one.

137
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,040
My dear Roussette.
Please don't let her leave!

138
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,220
Come on, Rémi, pull yourself together!

139
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,960
You know very well that we have to sell Roussette.

140
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,120
Since the accident with Father Barberin in Paris,

141
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,490
he doesn't send us a sous anymore.

142
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,180
We can't be without money, can we?

143
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,010
Poor Roussette!

144
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,770
Okay, let's go.

145
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,690
Don't cry!

146
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,690
Come on, blow your nose!

147
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,110
Go see!

148
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,350
Look what's inside!

149
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,440
Oh!

150
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,820
Eggs... Butter!

151
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,600
Let's make pancakes!

152
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,830
Oh, Mother Barberan!

153
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,940
It will be good!

154
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,190
It will be ready soon, little one!

155
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,670
Father Barberin!

156
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,670
How is it you?

157
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,390
We didn't expect to see you!

158
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,710
Yes, it's me. It doesn't seem to please you!

159
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,820
I thought you were still in the hospital in Paris.

160
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,310
What are you cooking here?

161
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,930
- Pancakes.
- Pancakes?

162
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,110
And that's all?!
For a man who walked 50 km?

163
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,160
Make me a good omelette with onions right now.

164
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,410
So you haven't read my letters?

165
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,440
I read them.

166
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,020
But I told you to get rid of the little brat!

167
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,020
Please!

168
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,570
We don't have a penny.

169
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,400
Are we going to keep feeding the bird outside of our nest?

170
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,680
Oh, no tears!
Otherwise I'll kill you.

171
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,020
Don't be angry.
It's because of the onions.

172
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,020
I come back home and you just cry!

173
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,020
Didn't I have enough trouble in Paris?

174
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,710
Didn't you get compensation for your accident?

175
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,980
Compensation!

176
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,950
My employer told the judge

177
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,950
that I fell from the scaffolding

178
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,090
because I had drank too much.

179
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,410
And I was denied the claim,
as they put it.

180
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,920
What? Aren't you eating?

181
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,280
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

182
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,840
Does he always eat so little?

183
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,560
No, he usually has a good appetite.

184
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,810
Of course.

185
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:29,290
I mean, he doesn't eat a lot.
He is very small.

186
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,150
An extra mouth is an extra mouth.

187
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,150
If it weren't for him,
you would have kept our cow.

188
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,580
Go to sleep, my little one.

189
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,880
So what are you going to do with him?

190
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,340
Damn it! I will hand him over to the orphanage.

191
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,850
To the orphanage?
You're not serious, are you?

192
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,850
Of course, I'm serious. And without delay!

193
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,280
Barberin! Hush, please, hush!

194
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,850
There's no use persuading me!

195
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,800
What's decided is decided!

196
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,500
I'm going to have a drink.

197
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,560
My little one!

198
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,840
No need for such sadness!

199
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,250
-  Did you hear everything?
- Yes.

200
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,130
Didn't I caress you and cherish you like a real mother?

201
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,600
- Oh, yes!
- Listen.

202
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,120
I lost a child your age.

203
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,680
And when Father Barberin found you at the door of the Notre Dame Cathedral,

204
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
I thought that you could replace him.

205
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,540
You were so handsome.

206
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,540
You were well dressed.

207
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,020
You know the little clothes

208
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,600
and the locket that you saw at the bottom of the closet?

209
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,220
They're yours.

210
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,220
I don't want to go to the orphanage!

211
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,890
Do not be afraid of anything!
I won't let him!

212
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:19,350
Come on, go to sleep, my little one!

213
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,580
Goodnight, my Rémi!

214
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,080
Your Mother Barberin is going to take care of you.

215
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,900
Mother Barberin!

216
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,240
Well, Rémi?

217
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,270
Relax!
Are you afraid of me?

218
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,340
No.

219
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,380
Have you forgotten that today is Friday?
Mother Barberin's market day?

220
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,470
Oh, no!

221
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,470
Do you want to go find her?

222
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,880
Oh yes!

223
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,650
Let's go together.

224
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,740
A bottle of beer.

225
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,740
We must hurry!

226
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,670
If we are late for the market,
Mother Barberin will already be gone!

227
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,900
Don't worry. We have time.

228
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,630
Well, have you returned to the country?

229
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,330
Yes, yesterday.

230
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,710
Ah, these insurance companies!

231
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,710
Why did they decide not to pay you?

232
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,430
A gang of crooks!
They are all the same!

233
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,430
Such scammers cannot be reasoned with...

234
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,010
We must hurry!

235
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,030
Ha ha!

236
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,190
When I tell you where we are going,
you won't be so pressed to leave!

237
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,190
- Ha ha!
- And your trial?

238
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,160
The trial? It was even worse!

239
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,750
Don't try to run away!
Your ass will be in trouble!

240
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,440
Wait for me there, don't move!

241
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:11,350
Capi!

242
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,230
What's the matter?

243
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,910
-  You are crying?
- No.

244
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,370
I can see that you are very sad.

245
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,370
What happened?

246
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,150
And why are you sitting here?

247
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,380
- Is that your father?
- No.

248
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,480
He doesn't want me to stay with Mother Barberin.

249
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,850
Why?

250
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,470
Well, let's go!

251
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,120
For you.

252
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,600
We need to deliver the package to the shelter.

253
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,730
And that's why he doesn't want me to stay.

254
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,530
Enough though I don't eat a lot.

255
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,400
- Poor little one!
- Well, Rémi, let's go!

256
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,490
Oh, monsieur. Do you really want to take this child to the orphanage?

257
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,600
What I want is for you not to get involved in my business!

258
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,950
Yes, excuse me.

259
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,580
But maybe there is another way.

260
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,410
And it could even earn you money!

261
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,040
Him? Money?

262
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,550
This little guy?

263
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,960
This weakling?
Not standing on its feet?

264
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,610
And besides, he doesn't eat! He's excess.

265
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,230
And I'm actually looking for a little boy to join my troupe.

266
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,230
I'll pay you well.

267
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,200
If you say it like that!

268
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,310
Patron! Two glasses!

269
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,040
So?

270
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,140
One hundred francs per month.
How does that sound?

271
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,180
Not enough.
This guy has never been sick!

272
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,860
He eats nothing, but is as strong as a horse. Come here!

273
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,760
Look at these calves,
at these muscles!

274
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,020
Two months advance payment!

275
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,710
Now, if you need to communicate with me,

276
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,610
write to me in the name of Monsieur Garofoli. 43 Rue Orsin in Paris.

277
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,610
Here are your two hundred francs.

278
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,060
Rémi! Grab him! He's running away!

279
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,850
I beg you!

280
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,270
Don't be so mean to him!

281
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,270
I am his master now.

282
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,240
Take me back to Mother Barberin!

283
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,800
Be brave!

284
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,180
See that barn over there?

285
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,040
We will sleep well there!

286
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,340
Let's go.

287
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,350
Go lie down in the straw.

288
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,350
You will see how great it is to sleep in it.

289
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,830
And how good it smells.

290
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,830
There, settle down.

291
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,830
Take off your shoes.

292
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,860
Oh, you poor fellow!

293
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,390
They're asking you for porridge!

294
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:05,410
Mother Barberin promised
to buy me new ones but...

295
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,740
Are you sleeping?

296
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,060
You will have nice new shoes tomorrow.

297
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,980
We will pass through the city, where there are magnificent shoes.

298
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,100
With nails?
- Yes. With nails.

299
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,910
You will also have a velvet jacket

300
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,390
pants, and a hat, like the Italians.

301
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,900
- Why?
- Because we are artists.

302
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,660
The public always prefers foreigners.

303
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,450
Here in France, I will dress you like an Italian.

304
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,260
In Italy, like a Frenchman.

305
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,700
Do not be afraid.

306
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,000
You won't feel bad with me.

307
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,020
You will see how we will learn,
wandering around the world.

308
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,030
I will teach you everything I know.

309
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,940
A bit of history, geography...

310
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,300
but above all music.

311
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,930
I will teach you to sing!

312
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:40,070
<i>Everywhere I saw the most magnificent beauty</i>

313
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:49,450
<i>But I have never seen in any city</i>

314
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:54,170
<i>Your delightful eyes</i>

315
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:58,340
<i>Your chiseled forehead</i>

316
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,200
<i>Your blooming cheeks</i>

317
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,560
<i>Your lips that promise treasure</i>

318
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,950
<i>Oh my Lola!</i>

319
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:17,970
<i>Your golden hair!</i>

320
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:23,130
<i>Oh my Lola!</i>

321
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:29,740
<i>I loved you madly!</i>

322
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:38,890
<i>I left my heart in Italy!</i>

323
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:43,350
<i>Since then my thoughts</i>

324
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:47,810
<i>Everywhere they follow you!</i>

325
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:52,570
<i>My wretched wounded soul</i>

326
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:57,080
<i>Suffering from melancholy!</i>

327
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:02,980
<i>Day and night</i>

328
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:08,970
<i>I dream of you, my tender lover</i>

329
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:11,890
<i>In your eyes, was a delicate mirror</i>

330
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,240
<i>I think I see it again</i>

331
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:23,410
<i>Italy!</i>

332
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,850
- Very pretty!
- You liked it?

333
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,150
Now let's try to sing it together.

334
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,030
Yes.

335
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,880
<i>Oh my Lola!</i>

336
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:42,090
<i>I loved you madly!</i>

337
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:49,930
<i>I left my heart in Italy!</i>

338
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,840
<i>Since then my thoughts</i>

339
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,900
<i>Everywhere they follow you!</i>

340
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:02,060
<i>My wretched wounded soul</i>

341
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:05,730
<i>Suffering from melancholy!</i>

342
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,320
<i>Day and night</i>

343
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:15,480
<i>I dream of you, my tender lover</i>

344
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,060
<i>In your eyes, was a delicate mirror</i>

345
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,570
<i>I think I see it again</i>

346
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:28,830
<i>Italy!</i>

347
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,960
Bravo, Rémi! What a progress in just a few months!

348
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,490
Now we need to study geography.

349
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,490
Naturally, this is not as much fun.

350
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,490
But in life you have to learn!

351
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,000
So, here's the map.

352
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,570
This is where we left.

353
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,710
Here is Ussel, where I bought your beautiful shoes.

354
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,230
See that big blue line?

355
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,700
This is the Du Midi Canal.

356
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,830
Once upon a time for ships to get from Bordeaux to Marseille,

357
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,060
they were forced to sail all around Spain.

358
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,570
- Are we going there?
- Yes, later!

359
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,660
And this is where we are now.

360
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,190
Here we will give a performance tomorrow.

361
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,220
Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to the famous Zerbino!

362
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,960
He will work in front of you.

363
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,960
Zerbino, hup!

364
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,890
Now it's your turn,
Mademoiselle Dolce!

365
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,520
- Careful, it's hot!
- Thanks, little one!

366
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,100
Come here, come.

367
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,950
Come on, spin!

368
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,720
Spin, spin, spin...

369
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,270
Bravo, Dolce!
Now you, Zerbino!

370
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,520
Get up, Capi, get up!

371
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,570
Get up now.

372
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,580
It's time to collect the fee.
Go quickly!

373
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,530
Sit! Sit.

374
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,530
You were naughty!

375
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,910
And as punishment I will kill you!

376
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,490
Attention!

377
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,790
Puff!

378
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,710
But now I am left
alone, Zerbino!

379
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,020
Come with me!

380
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,740
You don't to?

381
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,470
Then I'll go get the police!

382
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,720
Very funny.

383
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,150
Take the old man to the gendarmerie.

384
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,770
Let him sit there.

385
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,530
Your papers, if you please, monsieur!

386
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,900
Yes, Monsieur.

387
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,890
These are not correct!

388
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,890
There is a lack of permission from the
mayor!

389
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,020
But, monsieur, I have performed all over the country.

390
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,390
Nobody has interfered with me.

391
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,660
Here it is not the same.

392
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,270
- What is this?
- Let him go!

393
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,830
Leave the child alone!
He hasn't done anything to you!

394
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,200
How dare you raise your hand against me!

395
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
Well, that's enough! Follow me!

396
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,580
What have they done?

397
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,040
Do not worry!
I'll be right back.

398
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,320
Wait for me!

399
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,440
Your stomach is empty?
Mine too.

400
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:09,970
Since Master Vitalis is not with us,
we have not earned one sou. There's nothing!

401
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,490
There will be a big performance tonight!

402
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,760
What is it, Arthur?
You must eat your chicken!

403
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,200
These are breasts, they're the best!

404
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,280
I don't want it.

405
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,530
Think about the beggars.
What do they have?

406
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,840
Why are you poking at me with your chicken?

407
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,670
Eat it yourself if you like it so much!

408
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,940
- Mother!
- Oh, my darling!

409
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,110
How are you, my darling
- Madame, he doesn't want to eat anything!

410
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,970
Oh, we'll see!

411
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:44,020
My precious one, you don't want to upset your mother, do you?

412
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,020
- What's his temperature?
- Thirty-seven.

413
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,410
Over there on the road!
Look!

414
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,130
Oh, how funny!

415
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,730
Mother, please,
I want to take a closer look!

416
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,930
Well, of course, my darling, of course!

417
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,420
Stop, please.

418
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,970
Stop! Stop!

419
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,980
Come on, little one! Come on board.

420
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,240
Very well, monsieur.

421
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,780
Come here!
Come here, my little friend!

422
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,120
My son will be very happy to
see your artists up close.

423
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,960
With pleasure, madame!

424
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,990
Let me introduce you to Mr. Joli-Coeur, the general of my troupe.

425
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:36,440
Come on, come on, get off!
Thank you, you can go.

426
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,810
Oh my darling.

427
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,550
Do not over excite yourself,
otherwise you will get tired quickly!

428
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,220
Oh look! Look at them!

429
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,220
Here you go.

430
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,490
What did you just sing,
my little friend?

431
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,490
It's an Italian melody, madame.

432
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,260
Do you want me to sing?

433
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,090
- Oh, yes, mother!
- Yes, please sing!

434
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,200
Good.

435
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,340
Listen, listen, listen...

436
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:10,010
<i>Oh my Lola!
I loved you madly!</i>

437
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:17,020
<i>I left my heart in Italy!</i>

438
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,290
<i>Since then my thoughts</i>

439
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:23,570
<i>Everywhere they follow you</i>

440
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,840
<i>My wretched wounded soul</i>

441
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,880
<i>Suffering from melancholy!</i>

442
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,830
<i>Day and night... Zerbino! No! No!</i>

443
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,410
Shoo! Bad dog!

444
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:38,200
Madame, forgive him!
He usually never steals.

445
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,190
But he was so hungry...
- Didn't you feed him?

446
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,950
I want to... But I have nothing.

447
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:47,070
Poor animal!
Margaret please

448
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,760
go to the kitchen and prepare some food.

449
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,760
Oh, thank you, madame!

450
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,410
And you?
I hope you have dined?

451
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,310
Well, I mean...
I'm still a little hungry.

452
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,450
Sit down.

453
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,450
Here.

454
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,550
This is for you, just a little bit.

455
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,880
Chicken?

456
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,050
Eat! Don't you like it?

457
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,660
Oh, yes, madame!

458
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,170
Water?

459
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,790
No, no, don't be in such a hurry, or you'll choke!

460
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,670
A little water in case
you are a little thirsty.

461
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,270
Thank you, madame!

462
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,110
They are bringing food to your artists.

463
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,050
Eat calmly, I'll leave for now.

464
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,940
You're lucky!

465
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,710
Why?

466
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,940
That you're so hungry.
I never want to eat.

467
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:50,030
This is because you have too much food.

468
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,590
And they always give me only meat.

469
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:00,660
The bones are also a good piece!

470
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,100
This is true! And tastier if you eat it with your hands!

471
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,050
It's true.

472
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,230
Oh, pancakes!

473
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:13,090
Let's see whose is better your mother's or Mother Barberin's!

474
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:17,400
My mom makes pancakes just as good as yours.

475
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,120
By the way, the cook makes them.

476
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,510
But they are still very tasty.

477
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,390
Well, is everything okay, my little one?

478
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:28,580
Yes, mom! We ate with our hands like monkeys!

479
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,080
It made me hungry!

480
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,270
Thank you, madame.
It was very tasty!

481
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,450
Really? Then at 4 o'clock you will have an afternoon snack with Arthur.

482
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,700
You see...

483
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,380
it is time for us to go ashore, madame.

484
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,000
Not yet!

485
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,020
I need to find a place to sleep with my animals.

486
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,580
Mother, I don't want him to leave!

487
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,290
What if his parents are waiting for him?

488
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,430
His parents are far away.
They gave him to the animal trainer.

489
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,360
What?

490
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
- Where is he?
- He's not here.

491
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,360
I will meet with him in two months.

492
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,910
Until then, can he stay with us?

493
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,580
Of course, if he wants to.

494
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,970
Oh, yes, madame! You are so kind!

495
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,970
Oh, like all mothers!

496
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:04,990
Oh yes!

497
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:08,640
And your mother? Was she okay with letting you go?

498
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,540
Oh no, she didn't want to.
But Father Barberin forced her.

499
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,540
- How old are you?
- Twelve years old.

500
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,530
Twelve years old...

501
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,020
Forward!

502
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:03,280
Sit still, Capi! Don't move.

503
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,330
- Finally!
- My little Rémi!

504
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,610
My little Rémi!

505
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,490
Are you unwell?
You look tired.

506
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:24,110
Oh, I'm only a bit tired.

507
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,920
After all, I spent two months in prison!

508
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,520
Two months in a cell, without seeing the sky, without light...

509
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,350
It's hard for an old man like me !

510
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,820
But none of that matters!

511
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,530
Come on, show me yourself!
You just look great!

512
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,440
Let's go.

513
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,900
Come on, Rosie.

514
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,010
You know, I met a kind woman on a boat.

515
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,100
It's also a house.
And there is also a boy who is sick

516
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,070
And he became my friend thanks to Joli-Coeur.

517
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,910
- And also...
- Also, also, also..

518
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,420
You talk so fast that I hardly understand anything.

519
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,880
Yes, they came with me me here.

520
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,970
And they are also waiting for us.
You will see how beautiful their home is!

521
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:03,590
Oh, it's is such a beautiful boat!

522
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,960
Madame, I don't even know how to express my gratitude to you.

523
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,280
- What you did for Remi...
- He's so charming, your little man.

524
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,060
- Rémi!
- By the way, I need to talk to you.

525
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,020
Yes?

526
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,280
Do you know what mother is asking him?

527
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,720
- No.
- I know!

528
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,040
- Would you trust me with Rémi?
- Leave you Rémi?

529
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,040
Yes, he will be fine with us.

530
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,050
This boy deserves an
upbringing that you cannot give him.

531
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,610
Will you not answer?

532
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,610
Sorry, madame.

533
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:46,370
- I heard this melody from Don Juan.
- This is Serenade.

534
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,370
Recorded by Carlo Balzani.

535
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,640
If you only heard him live...

536
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,010
- Do you remember him, madame?
- Yes!

537
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,380
We applauded him so often when he sang at the opera.

538
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,030
Carlo Balzani!
What an incomparable artist!

539
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,440
It's a pity that he suddenly disappeared at the height of his fame.

540
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,300
At the height of fame...

541
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,160
Well, so what did you decide for the child?

542
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,880
You cannot fail to understand.

543
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,310
Instead of a life of vagrancy,
he will live with us as a family.

544
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,820
He will be treated like my son.

545
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:31,790
He will receive the same care,
the same education.

546
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:35,650
The most useful education, madame,
is what life gives us.

547
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:39,040
With me he will learn to live.

548
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,240
- Rémi!!
- Coming!

549
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,160
And you will stay with me!

550
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,740
Think well, my little one.

551
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:57,430
Here you will have everything that I cannot give you.

552
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:00,360
Life with me will not always be easy.

553
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,960
We need to move to Paris.
The season is already in full swing.

554
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,410
You will suffer from cold, from snow, and rain...

555
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,830
And you?

556
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,340
We will stay with you.

557
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,380
It won't be so difficult together.

558
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,100
Well, Mr. Joli-Coeur,
it's time to leave.

559
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,980
Goodbye, Arthur! Goodbye!

560
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,740
Goodbye, Arthur!

561
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,420
Capi, come on, my old friend!
Have courage!

562
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,950
You have four legs, and I only have two, but I'm still going.

563
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,460
Oh, Master Vitalis! Capi is very tired.

564
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,010
I'm afraid that he, too, will die of the cold,

565
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,680
like Dolce and Zerbino!

566
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,520
Come on, let's go faster!

567
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,790
We must reach the next village before nightfall.

568
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:17,190
We can't sleep outdoors in this weather.

569
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:24,180
Come on, Capi! Capi!

570
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,900
"At the Golden Lion"
Accommodation for hikers and horsemen. Food.

571
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,200
You there, what do you want?

572
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,490
I don't want you boring my clients.

573
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,370
We don't need your clients.

574
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,670
We just need a room that's warm.

575
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,370
Well, well, make yourself at home, you dirty dog!

576
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,250
I will pay what you want.

577
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,060
Could you also send for a doctor?

578
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,800
I have a patient with me. It's urgent

579
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,710
Very well.

580
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,630
Suzanne, take them to number five.

581
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,070
Come with me, monsieur.

582
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,070
But why?

583
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,560
Do what I said. Yes, hurry up.

584
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,530
Okay. How good it is to be in a real bed!

585
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,320
Soft mattress, white sheets!

586
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,470
Hey, it's too tight!

587
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,390
If it's not, you won't be warm enough to warm Joli-Coeur.

588
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,390
He is trembling all over!

589
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:46,850
He has a high fever.

590
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:49,760
Come in!

591
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:52,940
Doctor!

592
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,670
Let's see our patient.

593
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,290
Is it congestion?

594
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,410
But I'm not sick!

595
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,050
It's he who is sick!

596
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,210
A monkey?

597
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:14,420
You dragged me out in this bad weather to treat the monkey?

598
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,980
- Doctor!
- No!

599
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,870
- Listen!
- I, a former hospital expert,

600
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,170
certified physician of the Faculty of Castelnaudary!

601
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:23,170
But this is not an ordinary animal!

602
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:25,750
This is a great artist of his kind.

603
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,750
I could, of course, send for the vet.

604
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,930
But I preferred to turn to the luminary of science!

605
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,090
Just look how smart he is.

606
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,970
He extends his hand to you so that you can feel his pulse.

607
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,970
He doesn't want you to leave.

608
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:48,830
He is very ill.

609
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,460
I will bleed him.

610
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,340
You will also need to buy medicines.

611
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:05,830
We need to pay the doctor.

612
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,550
And for the medicines for Joli-Coeur.

613
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:09,130
I have some money saved.

614
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,390
- How much?
- One hundred sous.

615
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,390
That is not enough.

616
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,030
Go prepare the barn.

617
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,560
We will give a performance today.

618
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,560
- How will we do it?
- Hurry.

619
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,560
- Do what I tell you.
- Okay.

620
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,730
Is that all?

621
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,270
You can see that anywhere.

622
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:58,940
This is nothing special.

623
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,400
Ladies and gentlemen!

624
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,210
Please, don't go!

625
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:08,610
The show is not over yet.

626
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,880
Give me a couple more minutes.

627
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,560
<i>A sudden cry in the night: "Wolves!"</i>

628
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,840
<i>A cry full of fear and horror.</i>

629
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,020
<i>And then the camp got up: "Wolves!" </i>

630
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:33,460
<i>They have surrounded the travelers.</i>

631
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,780
<i>They raise their weapons.</i>

632
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,260
<i>The grass becomes covered in blood.</i>

633
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,210
<i>One falls, a new one immediately rises.</i>

634
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:48,180
<i>Howling animals, wheezing.</i>

635
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,390
<i>A great white desert</i>

636
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:54,960
<i>Where the world is ruled by terror...</i>

637
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:58,890
<i>But hear them howl and roar, wolves!</i>

638
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:02,040
<i>And we will unite our efforts!</i>

639
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,360
<i>There are many wolves on earth.</i>

640
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:10,290
<i>Victory will be for a strong man!</i>

641
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:14,600
<i>Sooner or later, evil will be punished!</i>

642
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:19,300
<i>We will defeat all our enemies!</i>

643
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,780
<i>We will go through our difficult path to the end.</i>

644
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:28,240
<i>Our future is in our hands.</i>

645
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,680
<i>The wolves are getting more and more angry.</i>

646
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:37,730
<i>But nobody else complains, nobody is afraid.</i>

647
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:43,380
<i>For there are no more cowards!</i>

648
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:47,720
<i>Sooner or later, evil will be punished!</i>

649
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,620
<i>We will defeat all our enemies!</i>

650
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:57,590
<i>And for this we will</i>

651
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:05,930
<i>Always keep hope!</i>

652
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:28,810
We made so much money!

653
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:31,400
- All thanks to your song!
- We can now cure Joli-Coeur.

654
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,150
You never told me that you sing so well!

655
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,680
This is the end.

656
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,140
With Capi alone, we cannot continue.

657
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,440
We'll have to make our way to Paris.

658
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,140
I'll leave you with Garofoli.

659
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:49,950
A friend, an old friend.

660
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,820
He'll take care of you during the winter.

661
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,500
And I...

662
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,800
I will give music lessons.

663
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,950
I wish I had left you with the Milligans.

664
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:05,950
It would have been better.

665
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:26,590
Mother, come look at what I've made!

666
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:32,000
This is Capi.

667
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,160
This is Dolce. This is Zerbino.

668
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,000
This is Rémi.

669
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,000
This is Joli-Coeur.

670
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,380
He came out slightly larger than Rémi. I made a mistake.

671
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,640
All the same, it's very beautiful!

672
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,020
Mother, do we have to stay in England much longer?

673
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,140
Yes, darling. Why?

674
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:54,340
I would like to see Rémi right now.

675
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,010
Come in.

676
00:48:57,010 --> 00:49:00,030
- I am looking for James Milligan.
- He's probably in the library.

677
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:01,190
Why?

678
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:04,000
- There is someone asking for him.
- Who is this gentleman?

679
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:08,260
He isn't a gentleman, but a scandalous man who won't leave without seeing him.

680
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:22,670
What are you doing here?

681
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:25,510
You never invite me to your place.

682
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,510
I said I didn’t want to see you.

683
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:30,010
- Come on, you can't do without me.
- Beware!

684
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,480
Are we being mean?

685
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,060
Fine, go over there.

686
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:47,220
Oh, what are you doing, my darling?

687
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,170
Uncle James gave you this book only yesterday.

688
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,730
- How unkind you are to him.
- I do not like him!

689
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,330
But he's so kind to you.

690
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,330
Even so, I don't like him.

691
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,650
Why is he living with us now?

692
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:01,550
But he is your father's brother,
my darling. It's natural.

693
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,550
Well, how great it is for you to live here!

694
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,870
It turned out to be an interesting visit.

695
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,010
I will likely ring again!

696
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,240
Do you want money again?

697
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,860
Well, of course.

698
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,720
I'm a victim of a crisis, things are going badly.

699
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,760
- Your business is that of others.
- Naturally, but they are no longer there.

700
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,960
So, it's good to have cash.

701
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,490
But since you are so smart,

702
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,150
can you tell me how to fill one's wallet?

703
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:28,150
- Well, that is not of my knowledge.
- Naturally.

704
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,670
- Seeing as you're so grand!
- Enough! You won't get a sou more!

705
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,160
I don't care.

706
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,780
You will give it to me anyway.

707
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,300
Blackmail?

708
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,760
You have no proof.

709
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:40,850
And for taking the child they will hang you.

710
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:41,980
Oh, really?

711
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:44,490
What if I haven't eliminated him?

712
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:45,560
What?

713
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:48,620
What if I find him and bring him home to his little mother?

714
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,810
And to please his sweet little uncle?

715
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:53,740
Is this a joke?
That'll take some work.

716
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:55,740
What if I have proof?

717
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:58,520
- What proof?
- The kid himself.

718
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,120
Will that suffice?

719
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,140
You're just showing off!
You don't have him.

720
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:06,810
Naturally, a person is appreciated

721
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:08,810
everywhere except in his family.

722
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:13,430
Okay, well, go on.
Speak, I'm listening to you.

723
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:16,770
How are you going to get the kid again?

724
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:18,610
Well, that's none of your business.

725
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,160
Fat pig!

726
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,790
You are embarrassed!

727
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:27,870
Embarrassed! Embarrassed!
Listen here, tart cream!

728
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:31,150
When I left the toddler at the door of a church in Paris,

729
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:34,370
I followed the man who picked him up to the train station.

730
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:37,700
And then I checked when he took his ticket.

731
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:40,550
That's where I'm going to direct my bones.

732
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:43,450
Bones, bones...

733
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:45,620
Your bones are pounding painfully!

734
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:49,840
No one will give the boy to someone like you.

735
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:53,670
Oh, not everyone can be such a luxurious chicken like you, Marquise!

736
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:56,270
In any case, you don't have to worry.

737
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:59,920
I'll figure out how to pretend to be a trustworthy person.

738
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:04,630
Say! What about a little visit from a reverend?

739
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,420
- Mr. Barberin, please.
- That's me.

740
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,530
I am the Reverend Slum from London.

741
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:28,420
Greetings, my brother.

742
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:32,570
I have come to you on a
very important matter.

743
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,330
Wait, I'll call your sister.

744
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:35,800
- My sister?
- My wife.

745
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,150
Ah, yes-yes.

746
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:42,510
He's a reverend, like a priest.
Call him "my father".

747
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:45,410
- Sit down, Father Reverend!
- Thank you, my sister.

748
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:48,870
This is what brought me to your land...

749
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:50,550
Oh!

750
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:51,840
Father Reverend?

751
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,520
Excuse me, but I came for this very child!

752
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,000
What an honor! This is my portrait.
I am three years old here.

753
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,740
Oh, then no.
I was mistaken.

754
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:03,690
Listen, I was sent by
a noble English family

755
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:06,900
looking for the child
you adopted ten years ago.

756
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,480
- Rémi?
- Rémi, that's it!

757
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,240
He had a lace nightgown,

758
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,310
a gold medallion, and an undershirt.

759
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:15,810
Now, imagine that some fool,

760
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,700
shameless and immoral,

761
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,090
stole the kid from his bed!

762
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:24,060
That is, I mean, kidnapped this defenseless body!

763
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:26,940
What scoundrels there are on the earth!

764
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,940
I saved his clothes!

765
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:30,310
Ah, you saved...

766
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:33,040
How did you find the
footprints of the child?

767
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,130
Oh, uh, the footprints?

768
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,590
Oh, that?

769
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,430
This is the whole story!

770
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,260
- Once I went by accident...
- Here are his clothes.

771
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,360
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

772
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,720
Oh, I recognize them!

773
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,820
The medallion!

774
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:51,090
The nightgown... Well, of course, recognize them from their description.

775
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:53,090
But tell me, where is the kid?

776
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:55,290
Mr. Rémi is no longer with us.

777
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:57,030
How inappropriate!

778
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:58,910
This is very outrageous!

779
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:01,220
Well, you know, I gave him a profession!

780
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,630
I made him an artist.

781
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:04,230
Well, where is he, your artist?

782
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:06,700
- I don't know.
- This is just great!

783
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,020
Wait!

784
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,570
Okay, let's see.

785
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:14,150
I probably have an address here.

786
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:15,750
We are not rich!

787
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,610
And yet I made sacrifices for his education!

788
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:20,960
- Here!
- So, let's see.

789
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,770
Garofoli, 43 Orsina Street.

790
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,920
Obviously, well done!

791
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:28,830
My dear Rémi will be so happy to meet his mother!

792
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:30,570
Yes, he will meet her...

793
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:33,170
- Here.
- I told you this not for the money.

794
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:34,280
However, we will gladly accept it.

795
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,400
Yes, that's not a bad thing.

796
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,190
Well, my children, I am leaving you.

797
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:40,620
Goodbye, my sister.
Goodbye, my brother.

798
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:44,760
- And don't forget to pray for us!
- No risk of that!

799
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:46,990
Goodbye, my children!
Goodbye!

800
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,450
But...

801
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:52,400
What if we gave away the clothes and the medallion in vain?

802
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,400
That was the only evidence of Rémi.

803
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,920
If you can't trust a reverend, then this is the end of everything!

804
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:11,210
And done!

805
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,650
Hey, Mattia!

806
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:15,150
- You'll see, it's funny.
- Give us an impression.

807
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,130
The horn.

808
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:19,380
Here.

809
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,440
That's quite the show, eh?

810
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:31,970
You will pay next time?

811
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:33,620
- Well, yes.
- Well, yes.

812
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:39,100
- The sous?
- I don't have any.

813
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,520
Give it to me! I saw them give it to you.

814
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,210
Oh, Vitalis!

815
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:01,480
It cannot be!
How glad I am to see you!

816
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,810
And this is undoubtedly the adorable child that
you wrote about in your letters?

817
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:07,340
Whom you will leave with me?

818
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,340
Whom I will leave with you.

819
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:11,340
He will become a friend to my little Mattia.

820
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,360
My heart breaks when I punish him.

821
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,790
But he breaks everything!

822
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:17,980
But I love him as if he were my own son.

823
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:24,680
Go on put on your jacket.

824
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,270
If you freeze, you'll have to endlessly heal

825
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:28,680
both night and day!

826
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,440
Go on, little one.
Go meet Mattia.

827
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,050
Leave us alone.

828
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,390
How charming he is!
I will teach him the profession.

829
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:41,110
He will be very happy here.

830
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:44,380
And then he will make a living as a waiter in a café.

831
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:53,250
- Does he hit you often?
- Constantly.

832
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,080
I have bruises everywhere.

833
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,660
You can play checkers on my back.

834
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,340
- And you allow it?
- What can I do?

835
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,340
He always beats me.

836
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,090
I was happy only once in my life.

837
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,090
When I was in the hospital.

838
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:10,480
Unfortunately, I have recovered.

839
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:13,170
And since then I have not managed to get sick again!

840
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:15,170
It's no use!
I have reinforced concrete health!

841
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:16,360
Rémi!

842
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,980
Listen. Do you want me to give you an advance?

843
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:26,390
Come on, Rémi. We're leaving.

844
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:27,830
Come on, Capi.

845
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,650
Where are we going?

846
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,650
I do not know yet.

847
00:58:03,970 --> 00:58:05,360
I'm going to rest.

848
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:16,990
This is a very important matter.

849
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,730
- Do you know Mr. Vitalis?
- Yes.

850
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,170
He always travels with a child.

851
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,140
Yes.

852
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,610
Well, this child is a foundling.

853
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,860
His parents are looking for him.
They live in London.

854
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,550
They have been inconsolable since their firstborn was mysteriously stolen from them.

855
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:34,500
Waiter!

856
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,040
And you think that the boy accompanying Vitalis is him?

857
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,780
I am sure of it!
I have all the evidence.

858
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,800
So you need to find your friend Vitalis as soon as possible.

859
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,370
Your findings are good?

860
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:45,930
Do you think it's that easy?

861
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:48,070
Vitalis dropped by just this afternoon.

862
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:49,690
I haven't seen him for eight months.

863
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,090
And who knows when he will come back.

864
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:54,080
Maybe today, maybe tomorrow, or maybe in six months!

865
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,080
How unfortunate!

866
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,720
Besides, I have no time.
Things are calling me to London.

867
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,050
Well, just in case,
I'll leave you my address.

868
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:01,930
Okay?

869
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,220
Here.

870
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:10,830
If you find out anything new,
notify me immediately.

871
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:13,630
You will not regret it.

872
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,470
Yes.

873
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,040
Good evening.

874
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:29,200
No, that will not do.
Have a glass with us?

875
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,200
Yes, with pleasure.
In a second.

876
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:35,600
And where will we go now?

877
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:37,300
I don't know.

878
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,480
My little one, forgive me.

879
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,740
I am at the end of my strength.

880
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:44,270
- Are you sick?
- Yes.

881
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,270
Very sick.

882
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:48,270
I've fought it for too long.

883
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:53,350
I didn’t want to leave you until you were assured of a normal future,

884
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:55,070
at least for the winter.

885
00:59:55,070 --> 01:00:00,570
I have used all my willpower to take you to a friend who will take care of you.

886
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:04,420
But now I can neither leave you with him,

887
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,460
nor take you with me.

888
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:10,230
Why won't you take me?
Why do you want to leave me?

889
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:13,390
I don't want to leave you. But...

890
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,730
I want to be with you.
Don't leave me!

891
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:20,380
- Don't leave me!
- I'm not leaving you.

892
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,380
Let's go, come on!

893
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,920
Wait.

894
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,280
I'll rest a little more.

895
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,510
What's do you have?

896
01:00:57,510 --> 01:00:58,970
Do not know.

897
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,460
My head is spinning.

898
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:11,870
Let's go down slowly.

899
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:20,250
Vitalis! Vitalis!

900
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,620
What can I do for you?

901
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:27,590
Vitalis!

902
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:33,180
The theater is full!

903
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:36,150
Even the gallery!

904
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,360
Success awaits you again!

905
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,050
Vitalis!

906
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:50,760
Vitalis... Vitalis!

907
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,760
Vitalis!

908
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,350
Vitalis...

909
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:01,350
Vitalis...

910
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:05,840
- Mr. Garofoli?
- That's me.

911
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,830
I'm the police commissioner.

912
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:08,830
Today a certain Vitalis was found dead in the street.

913
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:11,320
- What do you know about him?
- Vitalis is dead?

914
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,840
Poor fellow!
I loved him like a brother.

915
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:15,750
- Was he Italian?
- Yes, sir.

916
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:17,240
His real name is Carlo Balzani.

917
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,560
Balzani? Who is that?

918
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,330
A famous outstanding singer from La Scala in Milan.

919
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:23,330
I met him when I was a stage director.

920
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:26,320
- Does the child have a family?
- No, this child is a foundling.

921
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,940
That means we’ll have to take him to an orphanage.

922
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:30,540
Excuse me, gentlemen.

923
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:34,050
Vitalis was just about to give this child to me.

924
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:37,070
I have a letter from him on the subject.

925
01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:39,850
Here.

926
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:52,910
But I can't stay here.
That is impossible!

927
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:55,670
- I'd rather run away somewhere.
- Run to your parents!

928
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:56,930
I have no parents.

929
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:58,930
But you do! Listen, a man came here.

930
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:01,240
Well, come on, leave it to me.

931
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:05,430
Your self-sacrifice in relation to this orphan is sympathetic.

932
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:09,100
We will take this into account, and you will certainly be allowed to raise this child.

933
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:12,350
Oh, Mr. Commissioner, I will take care of him as I do little Mattia.

934
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:15,660
And thus I will fulfill the last will of my friend Balzani.

935
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:18,850
Tell me, why did this man change his name?

936
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:21,030
One evening, not getting the usual success,

937
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:23,030
he chose to suddenly leave the stage at the height of his fame

938
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:25,380
and his greatest fame.

939
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:26,770
Poor friend.

940
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:30,720
He seemed strange, but what a genius!

941
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,950
What is it?

942
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:35,870
I'll explain to you later.
We have to go.

943
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:40,540
Do you have any other information for me?

944
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:42,980
- No, Mr. Commissioner.
- Thank you.

945
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:50,890
Hunker down a bit.
Or you will be too tall!

946
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:01,040
Mattia!

947
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:11,560
I pretended to wipe the tables,

948
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,980
but I heard everything.

949
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:15,820
And then I watched where he hid the address.

950
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,180
Reverend Slum.

951
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:20,790
26 Green Street, London.

952
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:23,150
But if my relatives live in England, then I am English?

953
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,830
Only when you are with your parents.

954
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:27,400
- Then I am going to England immediately.
- So, are we going together?

955
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,790
Are you going to leave your patron?

956
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:31,440
Thanks to you.
There I will be welcome!

957
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,560
After a trip like that, I'll be able to sit for fifteen days!

958
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:37,090
- Poor Mattia!
- Plus, I'll be useful to you!

959
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:39,090
I have savings in my money box.

960
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:41,940
- In your money box?
- Here look.

961
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:43,940
You will see!

962
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:48,030
I have fifty-three sous here.

963
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:49,760
Of course, Rothschild is richer.

964
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,090
But we have enough for bread.

965
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:53,090
How will we get to London?

966
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:54,800
It is further than Versailles.

967
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,180
I was taught that England is an island.

968
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:58,870
All of England?

969
01:04:58,870 --> 01:04:59,920
I think so.

970
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:01,920
So we have to get on a ship.

971
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:05,030
How will we pay for tickets?

972
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,860
Let's wait for the workers to leave

973
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:39,280
and then we will go aboard.

974
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:41,560
You will see!

975
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:44,620
It's great that we don't have to pay for passage.

976
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:47,340
If we can’t go like passengers, we'll go like the animals.

977
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:50,590
- Do you think we can fit in there?
- No, let's make room.

978
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:52,730
We'll pull out the straw so we have more space.

979
01:05:52,730 --> 01:05:54,070
How are we going to breathe?

980
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:56,210
I have a fish knife. I will make holes.

981
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,970
Give me that.

982
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:01,570
Careful! Capi, step back.

983
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:58,940
Well, we've settled in quite well!

984
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,020
Say, it's a really a strange feeling when you are carried through the air like that.

985
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,180
Oh, yes!

986
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:08,830
Oh, carrots!

987
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:09,940
Oh!

988
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:18,250
Something else would be better.
But when you're really hungry...

989
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:20,410
Delicious! So sweet.

990
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:21,860
Do you want some, Capi?

991
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:23,230
No.

992
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:27,940
Hey, we are feasting in the hold!

993
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,970
Are you sure my parents are good people?

994
01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:38,020
Is your father a banker?
Some rich man, huh?

995
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:40,880
And my mother? My mom?

996
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,520
She's probably beautiful and good.

997
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,920
She will hold me in her arms.

998
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:46,140
And do you have any brothers or sisters?

999
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:49,050
Yes! And they will be happy to meet me!

1000
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,190
It's great to have a family.

1001
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:54,300
Yes, great...

1002
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:57,110
- Why do you say that so sadly?
- Because.

1003
01:07:57,110 --> 01:07:59,030
Because you don't have a family?

1004
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:00,470
But you will have mine!

1005
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:02,560
My mother will surely have enough money to feed you.

1006
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,840
And even to hire you a music teacher!

1007
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:07,320
Doesn't what I say comfort you?

1008
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,530
No. Because...

1009
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:12,460
- My heart hurts.
- Do you have seasickness?

1010
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:16,270
Oh, I don’t know. Maybe it's seasickness or the carrots, but something doesn't feel right.

1011
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:30,830
Where is Green Street?

1012
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:34,410
Oh, Green Street? Go straight and turn left.

1013
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:36,170
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

1014
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:41,190
It's here.

1015
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,950
My heart is pounding, you know.

1016
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:47,960
- What do you want?
- Reverend Slum, please.

1017
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,570
Slum? Don't know him.

1018
01:08:49,570 --> 01:08:51,420
This is on behalf of Rémi Barberin.

1019
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:54,520
Haha, that changes everything.
And even with home delivery!

1020
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,020
Let them in.

1021
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,000
Come in, my lambs, come in

1022
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,800
to the house of the gallant Reverend Slum.

1023
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:08,080
Finally, providence has decided to take our side.

1024
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:11,810
We came to see the Reverend Slum.

1025
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:12,860
Yes?

1026
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:15,120
- Which of you is Rémi?
- Me.

1027
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,320
Reverend Slum must take me to my father.

1028
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,110
Come hug your father!

1029
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:20,620
- You?
- Haha!

1030
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:22,340
Does that surprise you?

1031
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:25,360
It's only natural that you don't recognize me.

1032
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,210
When we last saw you, you were eighteen months old.

1033
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,670
I have changed.

1034
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:31,670
For the better.

1035
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:33,300
You too, by the way.

1036
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,430
Come into my arms, my son!

1037
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,500
Ah, the voice of blood!

1038
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,160
There is nothing else.

1039
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:48,370
And now...

1040
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:50,950
Go kiss your mother.

1041
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:02,580
And who is this?

1042
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:04,580
This is Mattia.

1043
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:07,460
We have been traveling together for two months.

1044
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:09,460
He is almost like my brother.

1045
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:12,060
You don't already have enough brothers?

1046
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:15,640
Meet your new brother.

1047
01:10:15,870 --> 01:10:17,420
Rémi Driscoll.

1048
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:19,420
Tom, the most grown.

1049
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:21,740
Alain, who is growing.

1050
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,220
John, the middle boy.

1051
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:26,990
He is one hundred percent Driscoll.
He will go far.

1052
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,410
Mel resembles his father.

1053
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:30,960
Little Lizzie.

1054
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:32,720
Her sister Eva.

1055
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:35,050
Beautiful, well-bred and all that.

1056
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:37,050
Well, and the youngest is Kate.

1057
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,580
Conceived recently from whiskey.

1058
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:43,130
Well...

1059
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,360
You still haven't said hello to your grandfather.

1060
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,100
Shake his hand.

1061
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,640
Not so firmly!
Can't you see he's paralyzed?

1062
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,920
John, go see who it is.

1063
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,240
- Come back later. He is busy.
- Tell me anyways!

1064
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,780
The old man doesn't like when his things are taken from him.

1065
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:14,830
Calm down!

1066
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:17,500
At his age, people become selfish.

1067
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:19,500
Who was it?

1068
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:22,800
Okay, I'm going.

1069
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:25,390
Everyone to their rooms!
I'm expecting guests.

1070
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:29,340
Lizzie! Take both newcomers to the guest room.

1071
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:34,710
Go to bed with Rémi.

1072
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:36,360
- Goodnight, monsieur.
- Goodnight, little one.

1073
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:38,610
- Goodnight, Papa.
- Goodnight.

1074
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,390
- Listen...
- Shh!

1075
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,950
Come!

1076
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:49,940
- Goodnight, Mama.
- Goodnight, Papa.

1077
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:51,940
Goodnight. Goodnight.

1078
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:41,500
Shhh, Capi!

1079
01:13:04,930 --> 01:13:08,060
- Yes, it's not cheap!
- Yes, but we almost got caught.

1080
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:10,730
- Why? Because of the dog?
- No, because of the alarm bell.

1081
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:12,460
Any longer, and I would have ran away.

1082
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:14,460
Oh, you turned red like a tomato!

1083
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,140
What are they doing?

1084
01:13:17,140 --> 01:13:19,140
That's why they sent us to bed.

1085
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,720
We interfered with them.

1086
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:32,490
I tell you, it's worth more!

1087
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:33,710
Oh, don't joke like that!

1088
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:36,960
Listen, you weren't the one who risked getting three years!

1089
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:41,550
Don't take it that way.
What were you saying? Okay, okay...

1090
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:47,080
Here you go. This is for your tea.

1091
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:50,080
And that, you know, is not cheap.
There is a mark on there.

1092
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:51,960
It's genuine.

1093
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:56,350
Are you sleeping?

1094
01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:01,500
Is this why we interrupted our trip around the world?

1095
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,990
A strange family.

1096
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:06,190
- They are my relatives.
- Oh, that can't be!

1097
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:08,750
If only I could find Arthur!

1098
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:12,350
Lady Milligan told me they have a property in London.

1099
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:16,670
But how do we find him in such a big city?

1100
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:21,060
Go on, Mr. Arthur, lie still!

1101
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:22,700
I can't sleep.

1102
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:25,380
If you keep quiet,
you will fall asleep immediately.

1103
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:27,380
No, I have a headache!

1104
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:32,460
- I heard him calling. Is something is wrong?
- He's very agitated today.

1105
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:35,660
He was prescribed drops so that he could sleep!

1106
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:07,480
Here.

1107
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:09,780
Drink, you'll feel better.

1108
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:15,260
What's this?
What are you giving him?

1109
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:17,630
- This is for me to sleep.
- It's his sedative.

1110
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:19,140
No, give it to me, my darling.

1111
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,580
- But, mother...
- Give it to me!

1112
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:28,800
What are you doing, James?
This is madness!

1113
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,300
You know that this sedative is very dangerous.

1114
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:34,880
The doctor only permitted it for exceptional cases if things got worse.

1115
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:42,360
Here, little one, drink.

1116
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:46,630
Now try to sleep.

1117
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,590
- Did I sing well?
- Yes.

1118
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:04,590
Even though I learned it very quickly.

1119
01:16:04,590 --> 01:16:08,110
But the result is deplorable.
What will Father Driscoll think?

1120
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,340
Come on, let's go.

1121
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:14,010
Children! We are not on earth to have fun.

1122
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:19,650
Pancakes with radishes! You will eat your bread from the sweat of your brow.

1123
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:25,070
If I let you, you will all eat from the sweat of my brow!

1124
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:29,740
To succeed in life today

1125
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:31,740
you have to master your profession.

1126
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:32,850
Understand?

1127
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:34,350
- Yes, Papa.
- Good.

1128
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:36,010
Your turn.

1129
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,370
Gently. Gently.

1130
01:16:42,370 --> 01:16:44,040
A little to the left!

1131
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:48,130
I have given you a craft.

1132
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:50,380
You should try to improve your skill

1133
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:53,560
so as not to embarrass the parents who took you in!

1134
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:54,930
Understood?

1135
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:58,810
No, no, not like that, not like that! No, no, no!

1136
01:16:58,810 --> 01:17:02,450
No, no, no! You will never succeed like that! Never!

1137
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:07,660
Leave the door open.

1138
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:09,420
- Why?
- Because.

1139
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:21,900
What is that?
Where did you take it from?

1140
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:28,610
That's good, Capi!
That's good work!

1141
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,280
Good!

1142
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:33,920
That, that's a job!

1143
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:37,080
So that's why you keep Capi with you!
To make him a thief!

1144
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,080
It's a shame, Capi!
Bad dog!

1145
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:40,680
You did a very bad thing!

1146
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,930
Where is Papa?
I'll tell him everything!

1147
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:45,670
Poor fool!

1148
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:50,690
Father, it's a shame!
John trained Capi...

1149
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:53,250
Here, Papa! I got it without cheating.

1150
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:54,690
So this is what you teach them?

1151
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:58,000
Watch what you say, brat!

1152
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:00,840
Your lousy songs bring in six sous a day!

1153
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,600
And you won't let your family work to feed you?

1154
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,600
What kind of work is this?
This is stealing!

1155
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:09,310
You should watch your expressions!

1156
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:12,990
You will honor your father and mother in order to live long.

1157
01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:14,990
If you don't remember this rule,

1158
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:18,020
I'll knock it into you with a good kick in the behind!

1159
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:20,330
- You think he will?
- And shut up there!

1160
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:22,550
I don’t need your jokes!

1161
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:24,230
How much did you bring in?

1162
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:29,570
That's all? Why you...

1163
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:32,890
That's enough! To work, to work!

1164
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,630
Go now!

1165
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:36,630
Go on, Mel with Helen!

1166
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,900
Rémi, take Eva!

1167
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,650
And his friend, Mattia.

1168
01:18:40,650 --> 01:18:42,650
You stay here, Lizzie.

1169
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:44,760
You will go to the church and sell flowers.

1170
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,420
There's a big wedding there.

1171
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:48,680
If you don’t bring in any money, there will be trouble!

1172
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,140
Go on, run.

1173
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,580
What are you doing here?

1174
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:55,460
Go on, join them! Go do something! For God's sake!

1175
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,060
Mr. Driscoll, if you please.

1176
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:06,520
He sent a note from Madame Jeanie.

1177
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:13,940
Oh no! Driscoll!

1178
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,840
Mattia, please find Capi.

1179
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,670
- They will make him steal again.
- Okay.

1180
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:28,440
So...

1181
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:30,880
Again, everything is rummaged through here!

1182
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:34,010
This is all my wife's doing, the cow.

1183
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:36,010
Oh, she told me...

1184
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:40,030
Well, you'll see now!

1185
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:44,990
- Can we speak in front of your...?
- In front of the old man?

1186
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:47,200
Yes, of course.
Go ahead, he is fully paralyzed.

1187
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,990
Including speech.

1188
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:51,610
And sometimes he foams like a laundry soap.

1189
01:19:57,950 --> 01:19:58,910
There you are.

1190
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,950
I hope you recognize these clothes?

1191
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:06,430
Yes, these are them.

1192
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:07,710
Yes.

1193
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:09,030
Well?

1194
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:11,980
Shall we return him to dear mother?

1195
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,350
- You are a bandit!
- And you're innocent?

1196
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:20,130
Look what you're saying!
Don't embarrass me!

1197
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:22,340
Okay, I will fulfill your requirements.

1198
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:27,050
But under no circumstances should Rémi and Lady Milligan be allowed to meet.

1199
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:30,580
- Where is the child?
- In the city, earning a crust of bread.

1200
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:33,420
- I will be back tonight.
- Very well.

1201
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:37,640
However, tell me, after all there is still the second heir.

1202
01:20:38,450 --> 01:20:40,480
I don't think he will last long.

1203
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:43,260
Despite the special care.

1204
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:47,600
Shut up, grandfather, shut up!

1205
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:53,110
Are you kidding me?
What else can I break for you?

1206
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:57,850
Ah, the window.

1207
01:20:57,850 --> 01:20:59,560
Drafts enrage him.

1208
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:03,000
- I am going back home.
- Yes, say hello to Lady Milligan.

1209
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,400
- What time does the child return?
- At seven o'clock.

1210
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:08,270
Just don't forget to do some formalities.

1211
01:21:08,270 --> 01:21:09,710
You will receive the money when the child is with me.

1212
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,500
What trust!

1213
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,360
- Here at seven o'clock.
- Agreed.

1214
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:35,910
Pig!

1215
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:48,630
How nice!

1216
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:53,000
Oh, poor children!
So young and already unhappy.

1217
01:22:17,740 --> 01:22:19,500
- You're not stopping?
- There's no cops.

1218
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,310
Okay, I'm going again.

1219
01:22:21,310 --> 01:22:23,930
- Everything is good?
- Couldn't be better.

1220
01:22:23,930 --> 01:22:27,000
The ranks will close again.
Go on, get out of here.

1221
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:42,330
Lady Milligan is in London!

1222
01:22:42,330 --> 01:22:44,210
She's looking for you because Arthur asked her to.

1223
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:46,580
I followed the guy over there.
I think he's his uncle.

1224
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:49,300
He has a very unpleasant face.
I have the address!

1225
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:50,970
Good! Let's go there right away!

1226
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:03,270
Come on, Rémi! Come on!

1227
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:07,180
- What's the matter?
- You will answer for the others.

1228
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:09,310
But I didn't do anything!

1229
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,490
Vile child!

1230
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:32,050
I will teach you how to protect your family!

1231
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:33,540
What if Rémi talks?

1232
01:23:33,650 --> 01:23:36,480
- We will all be caught!
- And I will cut off his tongue!

1233
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,320
- And yours too!
- Mine?

1234
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:41,110
- You're a fool!
- And you are crazy!

1235
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:45,170
I swear to you, it wasn't me.

1236
01:23:45,170 --> 01:23:47,960
- Tell me everything you know.
- I don’t know anything, monsieur.

1237
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:51,300
Don't be stubborn! We know that you are Driscoll's accomplice.

1238
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:52,710
You don't know that.

1239
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:54,370
We must get him out of the clutches of the police!

1240
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:56,040
I'll tell Lady Milligan everything.

1241
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,800
- Have you earned any sous?
- Yes, look!

1242
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,520
Good! Let's take a taxi! Come on!

1243
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,170
We need to see Lady Milligan.

1244
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:06,630
Lady Milligan does not permit vagrants.

1245
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:08,920
But we have something very important we need to tell her.

1246
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:10,270
Come on, let's go.

1247
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:17,050
How will we get in there?

1248
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:23,070
- You shouldn't be stubborn.
- But I don’t know anything.

1249
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,990
You will not say for whom you steal,
you will end up in a correctional institution.

1250
01:24:26,990 --> 01:24:28,410
I don't know anything.

1251
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:31,100
Take him to the camera.

1252
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:41,110
He's brave, that kid.

1253
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:43,430
He won't give up his parents.

1254
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:47,110
It's just as we thought.

1255
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:49,050
We tracked the children, they returned to Driscoll.

1256
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:50,520
It's always Driscoll!

1257
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,470
We still haven't found any serious evidence against him.

1258
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:56,040
This time, we'll visit him at home.

1259
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:00,850
- Get off quickly! He's coming!
- Stop that, kid!

1260
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,410
Damn it! That guy's always there!

1261
01:25:05,690 --> 01:25:07,170
What are we going to do now?

1262
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:09,440
- Listen, I have an idea.
- What is it?

1263
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:13,700
Please, Mr. Arthur, finish your soup!

1264
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:16,670
- I’m not hungry!
- Well, try a bit.

1265
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:18,010
No!

1266
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:25,330
<i>Oh, my Lola!
I loved you madly!</i>

1267
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:28,090
<i>I left my heart...</i>

1268
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:30,510
Go look! Who is singing?

1269
01:25:32,670 --> 01:25:34,090
Some children.

1270
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:36,090
Send for them immediately!

1271
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:39,340
- I want to see them immediately!
- As soon as you finish your soup.

1272
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:47,040
<i>Day and night, I dream of you, my tender beloved!</i>

1273
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,850
<i>In your eyes, there is a mirror...</i>

1274
01:25:49,850 --> 01:25:51,850
Don't run away! Don't be afraid!

1275
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:53,850
You are invited into the house.

1276
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:55,850
Let's go, quick! Let's go.

1277
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:08,160
I assure you, Mother.
It's definitely Rémi!

1278
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:10,470
It was his song and his voice!

1279
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:12,800
That's impossible, my treasure!

1280
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:15,890
You know that Uncle James did everything to find him.

1281
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:18,460
I'm sure that it was his song!

1282
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,870
Madame Lady Milligan, if you please.

1283
01:26:27,870 --> 01:26:29,630
That's me, my little one. What is it?

1284
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:32,720
Madame Lady! I'm a friend of Rémi Barberin who is not Rémi Barberin,

1285
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,240
since he is the son of Driscoll.

1286
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,900
And although his father couldn't force him to,

1287
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:39,110
he made his sister rummage through the pockets of passers-by!

1288
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:40,390
What is he saying?

1289
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:42,390
Rémi was arrested, but he is innocent!

1290
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:45,100
Rémi was arrested?
How? Is he in London?

1291
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:48,150
- Yes, madame lady!
- Rémi didn't steal! It's not true!

1292
01:26:48,150 --> 01:26:50,540
Rémi is simply incapable of doing bad things.

1293
01:26:50,630 --> 01:26:53,620
Madame, please, help us get him out.

1294
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:55,620
What if he gets sent to prison?

1295
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:58,920
What do you have here?

1296
01:26:59,620 --> 01:27:01,050
Who gave you this medallion?

1297
01:27:01,150 --> 01:27:03,610
- I took it from my papa.
- And where did he get it?

1298
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:06,120
Do not know. I found it in a drawer.

1299
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,390
Take me to your father immediately.

1300
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:09,770
Madame Lady, please, take care of Rémi first!

1301
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:11,340
- Yes, Rémi!
- Children, do not worry.

1302
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:13,340
I'll certainly help Rémi.
What is your father's name?

1303
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:14,900
- Driscoll.
- Where does he live?

1304
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:17,430
- London, Green Street.
- Let's go right away.

1305
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:32,310
What end do you have in mind?

1306
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:36,310
Was it worth being a brave constitutional monarchist all your life?

1307
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,610
Politics has nothing to do with your robberies!

1308
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:40,810
Shut up! You should be ashamed, Mr. Commissioner!

1309
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,980
Is it possible to imprison the gallant father of the family?

1310
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:45,950
Who laid down his life for the good of British soil?

1311
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:47,810
Yes, and who, at the same time, robbed country villas!

1312
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:49,480
That still needs to be proved!

1313
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:52,200
You have already searched my place fifteen times, and found only lice!

1314
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,200
We'll look harder this time.

1315
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:55,890
Yes, please do.

1316
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:09,590
The rest is downstairs. A full truck!

1317
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:12,300
What do you say now?

1318
01:28:12,490 --> 01:28:15,510
Mr. Commissioner!
I am a victim of coincidence!

1319
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:17,510
So you keep playing this game?

1320
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:18,860
It's time for you to sit down at the table.

1321
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:20,860
Oh, no thanks.
You've completely ruined my appetite.

1322
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:22,660
The more detailed your confessions are

1323
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:25,120
the shorter your sentence will be.

1324
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:28,210
Then I confess completely! Let me go!

1325
01:28:28,490 --> 01:28:31,230
Let's have a confrontation with the child. Bring him in!

1326
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:37,810
Oh, I get it. It was that bastard Rémi who betrayed us all.

1327
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:39,810
You are wrong. We didn't get a word out of him.

1328
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:45,240
Father Driscoll!
I swear I didn't say a single word!

1329
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:46,700
- Oh, you...
- It's true!

1330
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,700
This boy insists that he never stole and doesn't know anything.

1331
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:52,640
But this is true. He never suffered from anything.

1332
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:54,640
He never worked.

1333
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:57,340
What can I say? It's not his fault.

1334
01:28:57,340 --> 01:28:59,870
- He's talentless.
- So he's not with you?

1335
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:04,070
He would be! He would be had he not been given to you.

1336
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:06,830
Now I know how play a philanthropist

1337
01:29:07,370 --> 01:29:10,480
and raise little children who don't have a family.

1338
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:12,100
Let the child go.

1339
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:18,100
So he is an adopted child?

1340
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:20,650
- Where is he from?
- How curious you are!

1341
01:29:20,650 --> 01:29:23,490
I'll give you five minutes to think about your answer.

1342
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,710
I found him in a cabbage.

1343
01:29:26,850 --> 01:29:28,890
I recommend that you don't play the fool.

1344
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:30,660
Think about it.

1345
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:02,270
Driscoll!

1346
01:30:03,610 --> 01:30:06,440
Your only chance to escape harsh punishment is

1347
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:07,980
to lay out the whole truth.

1348
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:10,980
Oh, it's silly now to clink glasses to each other's health.

1349
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:14,340
But even if I tell you the name of the culprit, you will think I'm joking.

1350
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:15,430
Tell me anyways.

1351
01:30:15,430 --> 01:30:18,180
Well, the culprit is Mr. James Milligan.

1352
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,380
James Milligan? What are you...?

1353
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:22,590
See? What did I tell you?

1354
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:24,030
Go find Mr. Milligan at his house.

1355
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:26,230
No, no, don't bother. He's not there.

1356
01:30:26,230 --> 01:30:28,040
- How do you know?
- Because he is at my house.

1357
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:29,280
Your house?

1358
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:45,280
This is Papa's house here.

1359
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:48,270
Yes, but we must hurry!

1360
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:54,130
Papa! Papa!

1361
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:57,440
He's not here. Surely he will be back in time for dinner.

1362
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,210
Tell me, my dear, where did you find this locket?

1363
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:01,970
I'll show you where I got it.

1364
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:07,780
It was lying there.

1365
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:09,550
But...

1366
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:12,450
This gown...

1367
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,030
This embroidery...

1368
01:31:15,370 --> 01:31:17,650
I've been looking for them for so many years!

1369
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:20,650
I absolutely need to see your father immediately!

1370
01:31:20,650 --> 01:31:21,970
Only he can tell me...

1371
01:31:21,970 --> 01:31:24,340
- Oh, Lady Milligan!
- Rémi!

1372
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:27,240
How is it you?
Arthur will be delighted!

1373
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:28,420
Me too, madame!

1374
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:30,840
Do you know where Mr. Driscoll is?
I need to see him immediately.

1375
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:31,810
No.

1376
01:31:31,810 --> 01:31:33,950
But... Where did you get that?

1377
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:35,650
Do you know these clothes?

1378
01:31:35,650 --> 01:31:38,600
Of course! Mother Barberin often showed them to me in Chavanon.

1379
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:40,760
Did she tell you who they belonged to?

1380
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:42,080
Well, yes. To me!

1381
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,080
You?

1382
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:45,430
They were on me when Father Barberin found me.

1383
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:46,420
You?

1384
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:49,540
Oh, but... My little one, you know...

1385
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:51,160
I'm your mother!

1386
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:53,810
My mother? My real mother?

1387
01:32:30,500 --> 01:32:32,330
James Milligan?

1388
01:32:32,330 --> 01:32:35,380
You must be mistaken!
What would he be doing here?

1389
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:36,730
Madame...

1390
01:32:36,930 --> 01:32:39,230
So this is your first condemnation?

1391
01:32:39,230 --> 01:32:41,230
How long will they give us?

1392
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:43,230
A year in prison. Maybe two.

1393
01:32:43,620 --> 01:32:46,290
I'm getting a long time because of this idiot!

1394
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:50,190
Tell me, Mr. Commissioner. In prison,

1395
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:53,280
are husband and wife kept in seperate cells?

1396
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:55,860
- Naturally.
- Oh, then I'll tell you what!

1397
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:58,130
Put me down for five years.

1398
01:32:58,930 --> 01:33:00,130
Idiot!

1399
01:33:09,930 --> 01:33:11,400
Do you think it's too early?

1400
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:15,340
No, no, they should have gotten up by now. It'll be fun!

1401
01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:24,430
Attention!

1402
01:33:24,430 --> 01:33:31,600
<i>Oh, my Lola! loved you madly!</i>

1403
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:37,920
<i>I left my heart in Italy!</i>

1404
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:43,750
<i>Since then, my thoughts have followed you everywhere!</i>

1405
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:49,580
<i>My unhappy wounded soul suffers from longing!</i>

1406
01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:55,920
<i>Day and night, I dream of you, my sweet beloved</i>

1407
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:59,820
<i>In your eyes, is a delicate mirror, I think I it see again</i>

1408
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:02,970
<i>Italy!</i>

1409
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:04,670
- Good morning, Mother!
- Good morning, Mother!

1410
01:34:04,670 --> 01:34:08,320
Good morning, Mother Barberin! Come down quickly! There's a surprise for you!

1411
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:21,860
Come quickly, Mother Barberin!
There is a surprise for you!

1412
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:22,710
A surprise?

1413
01:34:22,710 --> 01:34:25,040
This is the gift he wanted to give you for his twelfth birthday!

1414
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,660
With his first savings!

1415
01:34:26,660 --> 01:34:28,130
Did you buy me a car?

1416
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:30,130
No, much better! Look!

1417
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,320
What a beauty!

1418
01:34:35,930 --> 01:34:37,530
My little Rémi!

1419
01:34:37,530 --> 01:34:39,950
Will you call her Roussette, Mother Barberin?

1420
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:42,760
Lucky you! You have two mothers!

1421
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,760
I'll lend you mine.

1422
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:48,260
Well, Rémi, my old friend! Now we can't say that we are without a family.
