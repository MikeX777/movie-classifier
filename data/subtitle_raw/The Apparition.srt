00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,920
THE APPARITION

2
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,720
<i>Memory card (Christophe)</i>

3
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,880
Chapter 1
Rome

4
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,840
"Bring back proof."

5
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,760
Christophe often said,

6
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,800
"I want to bring back proof."

7
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,280
Images.

8
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,480
Images of the injustice,

9
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,440
the violence,
and the madness of men.

10
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,880
Tonight he is no longer here,

11
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,120
yet he's still with us,

12
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,160
for his photos live on.

13
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,320
I think of his friend
and longtime colleague, Jacques.

14
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,120
Together they covered
numerous theatres of operations.

15
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,760
Sudan,

16
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,079
Lebanon, Yugoslavia...

17
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,320
Jacques was only feet away from
Christophe when he heard the explosion.

18
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:12,960
Fifteen years of complicity...

19
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,599
You have friends
waiting for you downstairs.

20
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:24,999
I shouldn't have let him go off alone.

21
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,400
He wasn't alone.

22
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:33,840
It was the first time
we'd ever split up over there.

23
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,480
Have a seat.

24
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,079
Can I go back to work?

25
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,960
Why do you refuse to talk to someone?

26
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,800
It might help.

27
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,320
Can I start working again,
yes or no?

28
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,800
You need rest.

29
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,640
Your wife worries.
You won't leave the house.

30
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,840
Are you still afraid?

31
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,079
<i>Mr. Jacques Mayano?</i>

32
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,680
Speaking.

33
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,079
<i>The reporter for </i>Ouest-France<i>?</i>

34
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:39,200
Yes. Who's calling?

35
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,960
<i>I'm calling on behalf of
Monsignor Vassilis, Bishop of Valence</i>

36
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,400
<i>and member of the Congregation
for the Doctrine of the Faith.</i>

37
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:49,120
What do you want?

38
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,079
<i>Monsignor would like to meet you</i>

39
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:54,880
<i>to discuss a confidential matter.</i>

40
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,520
Meaning?

41
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,440
<i>It's rather delicate.
His Grace prefers to tell you in person.</i>

42
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,120
<i>He invites you to join him in Rome.</i>

43
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,920
<i>Naturally,
your expenses will be covered.</i>

44
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,480
I'm sorry, but why me?

45
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,359
<i>Monsignor is familiar with your work.</i>

46
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,680
<i>He'll explain everything.</i>

47
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,520
Can't you explain now?

48
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,640
<i>Unfortunately, I'm not authorized.</i>

49
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,999
<i>His Grace
would rather tell you himself.</i>

50
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,239
<i>Like I said,
it's a highly confidential matter.</i>

51
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,520
Can I have his name again?

52
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,040
Come in.

53
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Come in!

54
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,160
Thank you
for making the trip, dear sir.

55
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,999
Please, have a seat.

56
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,680
- Were you offered something to drink?
- Yes, thank you.

57
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:55,920
Ever been to the Vatican?

58
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:58,280
No, it's the first time.

59
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,920
All this gold...

60
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,999
It's a far cry from the barefoot man
who preached poverty, isn't it?

61
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,800
Probably, yes.

62
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,680
How is your ear?

63
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,400
Better. Thank you.

64
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:19,400
I heard about your friend

65
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,200
and I'm sorry for your loss.

66
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,800
I knew his work well.

67
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,120
I wrote him a letter

68
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,359
expressing my admiration,

69
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,320
and he kindly sent me
one of his photographs.

70
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,880
It's right over there.

71
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,520
So.

72
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,200
We selected...

73
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,120
a few of your articles.

74
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,680
I'd already read some on the Internet.

75
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,400
You write remarkably well.

76
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,640
Excuse me, but why am I here?

77
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,960
You want me to write something?

78
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,559
Did you have
a religious education, Jacques?

79
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,680
I made my First Communion.

80
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,720
Are you a believer?

81
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:18,599
No.

82
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,400
I mean, maybe there's something...

83
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
but I'm not a practicing Catholic.

84
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,359
Do you know
about canonical investigations?

85
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,840
It's an investigation
to beatify a saint.

86
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:37,280
It's a commission
designated by church authorities

87
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,120
to investigate a particular event.

88
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,079
For example, a miracle healing,

89
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:44,480
an apparition,

90
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,640
or a supernatural event.

91
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,160
What's a "supernatural event"?

92
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:58,120
We've put together several documents.

93
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,480
They might interest you.

94
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
So...

95
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,960
Exactly two years ago,

96
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,880
a 16-year-old girl

97
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,760
claimed to have had an apparition

98
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,640
in the Carbarat region
in southeast France.

99
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:22,559
What's an apparition?

100
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:25,239
An apparition of the Virgin Mary.

101
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,599
Most of the time

102
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:34,239
things calm down on their own,
once the parish priest

103
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,239
or a good psychiatrist intervenes.

104
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,559
But sometimes
the phenomenon intensifies

105
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,120
and pilgrims
flood to the apparition site.

106
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,920
That is,
the alleged apparition site.

107
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:47,720
That's what's happening there.

108
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,840
The police say they're having trouble
maintaining law and order.

109
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,520
The young visionary's name is Anna.

110
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,079
Ever since her "visions,"

111
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,239
she has been overly sheltered
by the parish priest.

112
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,480
A Franciscan who has
cut off communication with us.

113
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,720
Father Borrodine.

114
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,640
He's even refused
to hand over a supposed relic

115
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,760
for us to analyze.

116
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,960
A bloodstained cloth they claim
the Virgin left for the faithful.

117
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,200
They even talk
of building a new church.

118
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:25,359
In short, the situation is worrying.

119
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,120
I'm sorry, but this isn't my world.

120
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,480
I don't see how I can help you.

121
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,120
I'd like you
to conduct a field investigation.

122
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,520
Gather elements

123
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,359
in favor of
or against these apparitions.

124
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,440
You will be paid.

125
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,720
And you will have total freedom.

126
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,120
There you go.

127
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,320
The Holy Office archives were moved
to another building last year.

128
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,800
We'll take the basement route.

129
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,400
May I please ask you
to give me your phone?

130
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,040
It's switched off.

131
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,640
It's the rules.

132
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,480
Right now, we're under
the courtyard where you came in.

133
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,359
As of the late 19th century,
photographs became more common.

134
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:48,160
Sound recordings and films came later.

135
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,559
He found some documents
for you in French.

136
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,760
This is the list
of officially recognized apparitions.

137
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:15,680
For each affair, there is
a file with the original hearings

138
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,280
of the visionaries and witnesses.

139
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:36,079
From 1961 to 1965, four young
Spanish girls claimed to have apparitions

140
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,720
in Garabandal, Spain.

141
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,960
Within months, hundreds
of thousands of pilgrims showed up.

142
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,040
The girls were questioned,
photographed and filmed.

143
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,800
But these events were not recognized.

144
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,999
There were suspicions of a sham.
Opinions are still divided.

145
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,720
After years of investigation,
the Bishop of Santander judged

146
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,599
that the supernatural nature

147
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,079
of the phenomena
in Garabandal could not be proven.

148
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,200
So, it was all a sham?

149
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:49,160
Let's say, the Church did not
officially recognize these events

150
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,960
or the supernatural nature
of the apparitions.

151
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,079
Now, a very rare document.

152
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:02,999
An officially authenticated apparition.

153
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,880
Ask if I can see
a recently authenticated case...

154
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,400
I understood.

155
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,999
L'Île-Bouchard in France.

156
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,640
Jacqueline Aubry, a saintly woman.

157
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:25,280
You'll find interviews with her
on the Internet

158
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,599
where she describes
her apparitions in great detail.

159
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,280
I met her personally in the late 90s.

160
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,920
She passed away in 2016.

161
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:39,280
- Was there an investigation?
- Several.

162
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,680
And in 2001, the Archbishop of Tours
officially authorized

163
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,960
pilgrimages to the site.

164
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:49,520
<i>L'Île-Bouchard Apparitions</i>

165
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,680
So once it's recognized, it's official?

166
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,359
Not really, but it could be a first step
towards authentication.

167
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,680
This is a letter relating the event.

168
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,320
Don't touch.

169
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,999
They're extremely precious.

170
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,280
"I saw the Blessed Virgin

171
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,840
and an angel

172
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,760
and she smiled at Jeanne.

173
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,760
I was with Nicole, Jeanne,
Laura and Sergine,

174
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,880
but Sergine didn't see her."

175
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,840
He can show you documents
on miraculous cures at Lourdes.

176
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,960
Sixty-nine cures
have been officially deemed miraculous.

177
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,320
The most recent dates to 1989.

178
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,480
Danila Castelli.

179
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,760
- Coffee, thank you.
- You too?

180
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,640
The events
the Bishop spoke to me about...

181
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,280
What do you think?

182
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,520
I don't know
what the Bishop spoke to you about.

183
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,840
Do many Christians still believe in

184
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:12,359
supernatural apparitions and miracles?

185
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,040
The Church would rather
bypass a veritable phenomenon

186
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,920
than validate a sham.

187
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,400
Always.

188
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,880
You mean that in these archives,

189
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,840
there may be stories
they've chosen to forget?

190
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,999
Is that possible?

191
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,840
Anything's possible. Anything.

192
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,960
<i>With the compliments of Monsignor</i>

193
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,480
<i>Apparitions at Lourdes</i>

194
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,880
<i>The Virgin Mary at Medjugorje</i>

195
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,840
<i>The Forgers of God</i>

Chapter 2
The Messenger

197
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,599
He's here. I'll call you back.

198
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,280
Hello, I'm Valérie.

199
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,920
Welcome.
Did you have a nice trip?

200
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:28,599
It's this way.

201
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
You have everything?

202
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,280
Town Hall was supposed to open
another parking lot.

203
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,160
It's getting worse by the day.

204
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,200
The others arrived last night.

205
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,800
Where can I rent a car?

206
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,599
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

207
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,480
Hear that bell?
Anna rings it herself every day.

208
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,720
The convent is at the town entrance.

209
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,599
Here we are.

210
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,440
This used to be a truck rental company.

211
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:05,880
When they closed,
the town turned it into warehouses.

212
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:09,239
You were supposed to wait for me!

213
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,160
This is Mr. Mayano.

214
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,359
Welcome, I'm Father Ezeradot.

215
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,800
Dr. De Villeneuve, our psychiatrist.

216
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:18,880
Stéphane Mornay, theologian.

217
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,920
Would you like coffee or tea?

218
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,239
Coffee, please.

219
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,400
And Father Gallois,
who represents the Diocese.

220
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,440
I'm very happy to work with you.

221
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,800
A nun will transcribe the interviews

222
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,040
and Paul-Eric here will film them.

223
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,680
- You're filming?
- If the visionary agrees, yes.

224
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,720
She gets to decide?

225
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,160
We can't send in the police
if she refuses to cooperate.

226
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,480
It's this way.

227
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,079
Are your accommodations comfortable?

228
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,920
Fine, thanks.

229
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,160
We've received some of your reports.

230
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,239
I'd love to discuss them with you.

231
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,680
Sure.

232
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,800
There's a coffee machine here
and a fully-equipped kitchen downstairs.

233
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,760
I'll let you settle in.

234
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:12,359
The apparition allegedly took place
near the so-called "Cabin in the Pines."

235
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,160
It's all indicated
on the map in the appendix.

236
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,239
- Are we free to visit the spot?
- Unfortunately, yes!

237
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,880
The place is crawling with pilgrims.
Like a fairground.

238
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,400
Our dear Stéphane
has a clear-cut opinion on events.

239
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:31,880
Last time I went to Medjugorje,
I was greeted with a shower of pebbles.

240
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,120
I told you about that, Doctor.

241
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,960
I was with that crazy nun.

242
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,079
Sister Bara or Mara.

243
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:42,680
Medjugorje is a small town
in ex-Yugoslavia

244
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,999
where apparitions have supposedly
occurred since the 80s.

245
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,520
We've all worked on the case
at some point.

246
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,720
And now they've built churches,
hotels, freeways...

247
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,359
I read about it.

248
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,280
Even fast-food chains!

249
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,280
Do we know who the exorcist is?

250
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,280
The name is in the folder.

251
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,920
Excuse me, but why an exorcist?

252
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,880
They still exist?

253
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,320
There's one in every diocese, yes.

254
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,040
It's the procedure
for supernatural events.

255
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,680
That is, alleged supernatural events.

256
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:21,520
We must first make sure
it's not the work of Satan.

257
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,880
And that the visionary
is psychologically sound.

258
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,079
Don't worry, Jacques.

259
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:29,440
I'm not.

260
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,960
I added three questions
concerning the alleged message.

261
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,079
In particular, the Virgin's formulation.

262
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,720
So, I ask the questions
and you can intervene freely.

263
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,880
I should hope so!

264
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,400
It's not Joan of Arc's trial.

265
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,079
Before we break up,

266
00:24:57,239 --> 00:25:00,079
Monsignor would like us
to read this document.

267
00:25:00,239 --> 00:25:02,400
The procedural rules

268
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,480
for the judgement
of supposed apparitions.

269
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:09,880
Would you read it to us, Jacques?

270
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,040
"According to the 1978
Norms for Judging Alleged Apparitions

271
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,040
published by the Holy Office,

272
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,440
now the Congregation
of the Doctrine of the Faith,

273
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:27,920
our Canonical Investigation Commission
must ascertain: one,

274
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,280
the personal qualities of the visionary.

275
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Namely, his/her psychological state,

276
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,960
the honesty and uprightness
of his/her moral life,

277
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,359
and his/her sincerity and obedience

278
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,640
to ecclesiastic authorities.

279
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,960
Two, regarding the revelation
of the message,

280
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,239
the theological doctrine must be true

281
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,840
and exempt of errors or inconsistency.

282
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:54,559
Three,
the commission must recognize

283
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,999
the visionary's healthy devotion,

284
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,880
and continual and abundant
spiritual rewards,

285
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,680
such as certified conversions

286
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,880
or expressions of charity."

287
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,520
That's all.

288
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,359
May God's wisdom guide our work.

289
00:26:21,239 --> 00:26:23,559
More people arrived during the night.

290
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,599
- I saw them at the town entrance.
- They're all over!

291
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,999
Look. They can't handle it.

292
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,480
Come on, there's another entrance.

293
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,200
Brothers and sisters, Anna is with us.

294
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,239
Let us pray to the Lord.

295
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,239
Brothers and sisters,

296
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,760
what a joy to see so many people.

297
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,040
Anna is with us.

298
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,960
Let us thank the Blessed Virgin.

299
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,480
You have no business here.

300
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,480
You shut your door to us?

301
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,320
How dare you?

302
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,280
I know who you are!

303
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,960
Leave us in peace.

304
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,680
Christians don't shut their door!

305
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,200
The Blessed Virgin
gave me a message of love,

306
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:59,680
for only love will save us.

307
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,440
Today,
I would like to greet all those

308
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:05,720
who come from afar
and who await so much from us.

309
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,480
Those who come
from countries torn by war and poverty.

310
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:15,640
I also think about
those who didn't make it this far.

311
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
Those who were left on the road.

312
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,599
Those who have died.

313
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,280
They're with us too, forever.

314
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,720
Let us pray for them all.

315
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,040
Hello, could I talk to you?

316
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,960
I know why you're here.

317
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,520
Let's go.

318
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,960
<i>Can you hear... You're cutting out...</i>

319
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,200
<i>It's an English news site.</i>

320
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:41,320
<i>They want to do
a story on wounded war reporters.</i>

321
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,599
Tell them you can't reach me,
that I'm on sick leave.

322
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,760
<i>That's what I tell everyone.</i>

323
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,280
<i>What are your colleagues like?</i>

324
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,520
They talk about exorcism
and apparitions.

325
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,520
It's routine stuff for them.

326
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,760
<i>Is your place comfortable?</i>

327
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,079
Yeah.

328
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,400
<i>Have you blocked out the windows?</i>

329
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,999
No, not yet.

330
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,520
Look, I need to review my questions.

331
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,040
<i>You take care of yourself.</i>

332
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,599
There you go.

333
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,160
Anna, you can still change your mind.

334
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,040
I'm ready.

335
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,599
OK.

336
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:00,440
Let's go.

337
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,359
Don't worry,
they can't do anything to you.

338
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,200
Thank you, Mother.

339
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,880
What do you see?

340
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,520
The hands of pilgrims
trying to touch me.

341
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,160
Under no circumstances
may these recordings be made public.

342
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,480
Don't worry.
This will remain confidential.

343
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,520
We have nothing to hide.

344
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,680
I'll leave you now.

345
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,280
This way.

346
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,999
This is the commission.

347
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,840
Dr. De Villeneuve is a psychiatrist.

348
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,920
Stéphane Mornay, a theologian.

349
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,760
Paul-Eric,
Sister Sophie, our stenotypist.

350
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,400
Father Gallois.

351
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:57,760
And Jacques Mayano, journalist.

352
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,800
Over here.

353
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,520
Please, sit down.

354
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,640
Thank you for accepting our invitation.

355
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,400
Jacques will conduct the interview.

356
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:14,680
We've all discussed
each of the questions.

357
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,640
Please understand
that no-one here wishes you any harm.

358
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,160
Before starting, Anna,

359
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,480
please put your hand on the Bible
and say "I swear."

360
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,640
I'm not sure I'm allowed to.

361
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,120
Don't worry, it's only a custom.

362
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,120
I swear.

363
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,760
First of all,
please state your identity.

364
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,520
My name is Anna Ferron.

365
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,920
I was born anonymously
on January 20, 1999, in Lagnon.

366
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,200
I'm a novice
at the La Providence convent.

367
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,480
Did you receive a religious education?

368
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,920
I went to church with my grandmother
in my first family.

369
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,559
But when she died, I stopped.

370
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,520
Later, I was placed in a Catholic home

371
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,999
because my family couldn't keep me.

372
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:22,520
Was religion present
during your early childhood?

373
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,640
No, we didn't talk about it
in my families.

374
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,040
Did you think about God
or the Virgin Mary?

375
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,640
Did you discuss this with grownups?

376
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,280
Father Borrodine
was the first person I talked to.

377
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,120
When I started feeling things.

378
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,440
Could you describe what you felt?

379
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:45,640
It was like...

380
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,920
Like a calling.

381
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,359
How old were you at the time?

382
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,280
Fifteen.

383
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,720
Had you heard of apparitions?

384
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,320
I knew the story
of Bernadette of Lourdes.

385
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:06,800
Like everybody else.

386
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,999
Had you read any books on the subject?

387
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,280
Or seen images or films?

388
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,120
For example,
about the apparitions at Fátima.

389
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,400
Or Garabandal and Medjugorje?

390
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,720
I heard about them later
from the pilgrims

391
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,720
and on the Internet.

392
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:28,079
Did you ever belong
to a Satanic or occult movement,

393
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:29,680
or anything similar?

394
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,960
No, never.

395
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:37,520
But I believe the Devil exists.

396
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:40,239
I'm sure of it. Evil.

397
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,200
Did Father Borrodine
suggest that you enter the Church?

398
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:50,960
No. That's not how it works.

399
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,359
It has to come from within.

400
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,239
I asked him if I could meet
the sisters, to learn more.

401
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:01,440
And...

402
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,720
that's when I had the first apparition.

403
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,200
The first one was two years ago,
in September.

404
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,800
It had rained all day long.

405
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,520
I went out for a walk, like I often do.

406
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,920
- Were you alone?
- Yes.

407
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,040
It was cold out.

408
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,760
And when I reached the first refuge,

409
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,960
I saw a glow further down.

410
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,320
What do you mean by "a glow"?

411
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,079
Can you describe it for us?

412
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,239
I thought it was the sun
reflecting off the wet rocks.

413
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,200
Like after a storm.

414
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,160
About how far away were you?

415
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,440
Can you show me?

416
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,800
I don't know.

417
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,359
About here.

418
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,960
Were you blinded?

419
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:10,239
Did you have to look away
or close your eyes?

420
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,160
It was a soft light.

421
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,920
Very soft.

422
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,359
Did it have a shape?

423
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,840
As I came closer
I saw a human shape.

424
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,359
Did you think it was someone?
I mean, someone real?

425
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,040
No, I knew it was something else.

426
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,120
What?

427
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,040
A woman.

428
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,840
A very beautiful woman.

429
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,840
She wore a very simple veil and cloak.

430
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,160
What color?

431
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:07,840
The dress was white, or light-colored...

432
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,200
and the cloak was sky blue.

433
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,320
And then?

434
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,520
Then I heard her voice.

435
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,800
A calm voice.

436
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:25,999
Did she speak to you in French?

437
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,440
Yes.

438
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,840
She said to me,

439
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:32,040
"You mustn't be afraid."

440
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,680
And did you reply?

441
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:43,880
No, I couldn't speak.

442
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:49,680
What was her exact message to you?

443
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,920
Her precise words?

444
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,760
She said,

445
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,079
"I hear the cries of the world."

446
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,960
She asked me to teach people around me
to learn to give of themselves,

447
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,200
to help the poor and the suffering.

448
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,599
Then she asked me
to build a house for her son.

449
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,239
A place of welcome and prayer.

450
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,440
Carry on, Anna.

451
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,320
It didn't last long.

452
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,720
The light faded.

453
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,720
And I was alone again.

454
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,640
Everything was silent.

455
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,480
I went home
and locked myself in my room.

456
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,599
I didn't want to talk to anyone.

457
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,400
You couldn't tell your friends?

458
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:57,160
It was impossible.

459
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,079
They'd have thought I was crazy.

460
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,640
Later, I decided
to tell Father Borrodine what happened.

461
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,520
- So you told him?
- Yes.

462
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,760
How long afterwards?

463
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:19,120
A few weeks, maybe a month.

464
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,520
What was his reaction?

465
00:42:24,999 --> 00:42:27,079
He said it was blasphemy.

466
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,960
He said I was proud and self-centered.

467
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,520
How did people around you
find out what happened?

468
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,400
No-one knew.

469
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:39,200
We kept it secret for over a year.

470
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,920
It was only after the second apparition
that people started talking.

471
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:09,840
Sister Elisabeth,
can you please get the car?

472
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:11,359
Go on.

473
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,920
Sister...

474
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:14,920
Goodbye, dear colleague.

475
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,520
I'm not a liar.

476
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,840

Chapter 3
Anna

478
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,280
Hello, this is Jacques Mayano.

479
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,320
I'm part of the Canonical
Investigation Commission in Carbarat.

480
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,440
I saw that you wrote articles
on the events.

481
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:01,120
I'd like to talk to you.

482
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,440
I'll leave you my number.

483
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,680
06-58-68-09-18.

484
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:10,480
Thank you. That's Jacques Mayano.

485
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,280
Hello.

486
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,559
How are you?

487
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,200
- Well, and you?
- Fine.

488
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:37,400
This is a gift for you.

489
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,760
It's from the entire
Philadelphia community.

490
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,280
They'd love to see you for real,
not just on the Internet.

491
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,680
I'd be very happy
to pray with them too.

492
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,239
Did you see the items
we published on your website?

493
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,800
They've been copied everywhere.

494
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,280
Benoît is the sound engineer.

495
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,120
Christophe is the cameraman.

496
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,040
People have a great deal
of love and respect for you

497
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,480
over there.

498
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,320
OK.

499
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,320
I'll ask you questions in French.

500
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,480
And of course, you'll answer in French.

501
00:49:15,999 --> 00:49:18,920
You will be dubbed in several languages.

502
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:21,280
The interview will be on the Internet

503
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,079
in many countries.

504
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:25,559
Do what you like, I trust you.

505
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,720
Rolling.

506
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,559
Hello, Anna.

507
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,640
I'd like to begin
with a simple question...

508
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,920
How are you?

509
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,160
OK.

510
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:50,120
Christians from all over the world
are here today to see you.

511
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,200
What does this mean to you?

512
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,920
I don't believe in this relic.

513
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,359
The fabric, the bloodstain...

514
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,680
I never bought it.

515
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,040
Why not?

516
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:14,359
The Blessed Virgin
has always been an image of love,

517
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,200
kindness and understanding.

518
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:18,680
She can't be associated
with violence.

519
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,680
It's in total contradiction
with the tradition of apparitions.

520
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,999
Precisely,
perhaps it's a new symbol.

521
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,559
It's absolutely impossible.

522
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,320
It's not because it's new
that it's impossible.

523
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,920
Right, Jacques?

524
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:35,520
We need to analyze the fabric.

525
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,880
Who can seize the object?

526
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,480
The chief of police.

527
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,999
If he believes
there's a threat to public order,

528
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,040
he can confiscate the relic

529
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,040
and give it to the Bishop for analysis.

530
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,599
Even in a convent?

531
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,599
Convents belong to the State,
not the Diocese.

532
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,400
The State is free
to seize whatever it wants.

533
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,840
Would the pilgrims allow it?

534
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:08,160
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

535
00:51:10,999 --> 00:51:12,320
Here.

536
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,160
Mother Superior said you should rest.

537
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,440
We could accommodate 800 pilgrims.

538
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,480
Like in Medjugorje.

539
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,800
In the meantime, I'm not even authorized
to say mass in my own parish.

540
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,920
Will the commission question you too?

541
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,840
I've refused.

542
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,440
What's the use?

543
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,040
The Bishop has multiplied
signs of hostility.

544
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,359
Now this commission...

545
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,920
If you need strength, Father,

546
00:51:57,559 --> 00:51:59,160
think of her eyes.

547
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,880
Anna's eyes.

548
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,720
I've never seen a gaze like hers.

549
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,880
She wasn't chosen by chance.

550
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,760
You've shown great support.

551
00:52:16,359 --> 00:52:19,920
We must uphold
the modesty and clarity of her message.

552
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,200
That's the only truth.

553
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,160
I understand, Father.

554
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,040
We must keep our dignity.

555
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,720
Be worthy of the Grace she's received.

556
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:28,440
I'm Jacques Mayano.
We spoke on the phone about Anna.

557
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:30,200
Oh yes, hello.

558
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,760
Her hair was lighter at the time.

559
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,239
- How old was she when she got here?
- Six. She was little.

560
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:45,800
The county commission placed her here.

561
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,280
And before that?

562
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,520
She was in day care and foster care.

563
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,800
Have you taken in many children?

564
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,200
Yes, lots.

565
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,680
They stay a few years and move on.

566
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,880
They go back to their families
or to homes.

567
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,640
I always keep a drawing.

568
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,960
I like to draw too and it's a souvenir.
Have a seat.

569
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:14,079
Pilgrims come all the way here now
to see the house.

570
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:16,599
They want to see where the girl slept.

571
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,440
They touch the stones, the trees...

572
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,440
I dug up everything I had.

573
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,440
Did you keep administrative documents,
like report cards or medical records?

574
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:30,480
When a child leaves,

575
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,120
the paperwork goes with him.

576
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,640
It's important for everyone to cut ties.

577
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,520
They need to move on
when they change families.

578
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,400
Otherwise,
the separations get too painful.

579
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,599
Her report says she had
no particular problems at school.

580
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,720
It didn't interest her much, either.
But she was a good girl.

581
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,200
Never ran away or made trouble.

582
00:54:56,999 --> 00:54:58,160
She was a loner.

583
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,280
Why did she leave?

584
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,520
My husband died and left me
with three foster kids. It was too much.

585
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,680
The older ones were troublemakers.

586
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,320
Anna was 14.

587
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,280
She returned to the State home.

588
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,559
May I take photos
of the documents and photographs?

589
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,559
- Is it legal?
- Yes, don't worry.

590
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,559
This was her room.

591
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,840
Now it's my laundry room.

592
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,960
She slept here for eight years.

593
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,720
We put that there as a mark of respect.

594
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,640
What do you think
about these apparitions?

595
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,960
When I saw her last year,
she swore it was true.

596
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,320
She wouldn't have lied to me.

597
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,040
She's not a liar, you know.

598
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,559
So, you're the one who decides
if it's all true or not?

599
00:56:55,999 --> 00:56:59,720
<i>"Snowdrop" Educational Center</i>

600
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,640
<i>Dear Father,</i>

601
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,800
<i>I've made up my mind to become</i>

602
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,320
<i>a novice at the
La Providence convent.</i>

603
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:23,280
<i>I wish to devote my life to prayer
and help the suffering.</i>

604
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,960
<i>I know now that I'm meant
for a life in the service of God.</i>

605
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:29,640
<i>I want to leave the foster home</i>

606
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,400
<i>and enter the convent
as soon as you think it's possible.</i>

607
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:37,079
<i>I can't live here
with the other girls anymore,</i>

608
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:40,840
<i>for I am now certain
that my real life is elsewhere.</i>

609
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,760
<i>I have a secret to tell you.</i>

610
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,520
<i>Something extraordinary happened to me.</i>

611
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,760
<i>It's a very big secret.</i>

612
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,400
<i>I don't know who I can share it with,
other than you.</i>

613
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,880
<i>I'm afraid of what might happen.</i>

614
00:58:02,359 --> 00:58:05,239
<i>Even if I know,
I need only look at the immense sky</i>

615
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,079
<i>and my fear disappears.</i>

616
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,559
<i>Help me.</i>

617
00:58:08,999 --> 00:58:10,400
<i>Have pity.</i>

618
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,320
<i>Anna.</i>

619
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,680
Which path did you say she took?

620
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,040
You see that bush?

621
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,359
She followed the ridge
and disappeared on the other side.

622
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,079
- Over there?
- Yeah, right behind there.

623
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:27,079
She screamed real loud.

624
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,800
A huge scream.

625
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,840
Like someone who was scared?

626
00:58:34,999 --> 00:58:36,960
Yeah, real scared.

627
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,920
A scream you don't forget.

628
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:42,239
And it was the day of the apparition?

629
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:44,520
Yes. People talked about it later.

630
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,079
And we put two and two together.

631
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:49,280
The next day?

632
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,359
No, long after.
When people started talking.

633
00:58:52,999 --> 00:58:55,359
Did you see how she was dressed?

634
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,880
No, we didn't have time to see.
Besides, she was far.

635
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,320
It happened so fast.

636
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,160
- You didn't see her face?
- No.

637
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,999
Her back was facing us
and then she was gone.

638
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,400
How old was she, 10 or 12?

639
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:10,480
A little more, 14 or 15.

640
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,559
- A young girl?
- Yes, a young girl.

641
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,999
It was a shrill scream, like a child.

642
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:19,680
"A scream you don't forget."

643
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,800
What's this nonsense
about screams, terror and bloodstains?

644
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,999
She's loony, end of story.

645
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,999
Did you read her foster care file?

646
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,359
Yes, I read it.

647
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:41,440
She was only 16,
so they concocted an internship

648
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,239
at the convent factory.

649
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,400
She dropped out,
and when she turned 18...

650
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,760
she entered the Church
and no-one could do anything. That's it.

651
00:59:52,599 --> 00:59:55,120
It was sainthood
or hairdressing school.

652
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:02,320
In any case, she agreed
to take all our medical exams.

653
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,800
And?

654
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:08,640
For the moment, I've detected
no significant psychological disorders.

655
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,999
She spent her life in foster facilities.

656
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,920
That's got to have
an impact of some sort.

657
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,120
We're only at the start.

658
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:22,720
Then what's the deal?

659
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,520
She's just some lost girl
who found a way to draw attention?

660
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:31,480
A poor kid
who can't face school, life...

661
01:00:31,999 --> 01:00:33,640
people... Is that it?

662
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:41,320
What is this world
where we must learn to live?

663
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,680
What is this world?

664
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:52,200
Let us remember the words
of our Holy Father Pope Francis,

665
01:00:52,999 --> 01:00:56,760
"Is anyone today still capable
of taking responsibility

666
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,720
for the suffering of others?"

667
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,359
We look at our brother,
half-dead on the side of the road...

668
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,960
Maybe we think,

669
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,160
"poor man," as we stare
at his picture on the Internet.

670
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,160
Nonetheless, we keep walking

671
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,520
and leave him behind.

672
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:19,079
Our culture of well-being
encourages us to think of ourselves

673
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:20,680
and makes us insensitive

674
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,999
to the distress of others.

675
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,680
We might live in beautiful bubbles,

676
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,999
they are nothing.

677
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,920
They are the illusion

678
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,960
of the futile,

679
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,120
the temporary.

680
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:42,280
An illusion that creates
indifference toward others.

681
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,440
We have fallen

682
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,680
into globalized indifference.

683
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,599
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

684
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,720
we thank you for the message of mercy

685
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,680
you have sent us.

686
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:43,440
Hello, Anna.

687
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:48,120
I saw you on the web.
I didn't realize who you were.

688
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,400
Keep moving, Anna.

689
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,480
Hello, Father.

690
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,440
That was a beautiful speech.

691
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:05,920
Really.

692
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,359
Your commission will only cause harm.

693
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,040
It's a Church investigation.

694
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,480
You're a priest.

695
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,640
I'll pray for you.

696
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,599
Don't worry about me.

697
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:22,880
I have to go.

698
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,880
Let's go, Anna.

699
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,480
You haven't understood, Mr. Mayano.

700
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,960
It's Anna who called you here,

701
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,440
to put us to the test.

702
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:43,160
- You really believe she has that power?
- Yes.

703
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,680
I do.

704
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,520
I truly do.

705
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,520
Where do I pick you up?

706
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:33,599
Same place as last time?

707
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,840
You'll be careful, OK?

708
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:21,999
- Hey, dude.
- Hi.

709
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,599
Thanks.

710
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:18,079
<i>I send you my love, dear Anna.
So does Pavel!</i>

711
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,599
<i>Write soon, Meriem.</i>

712
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:37,239
- Are you happy working here?
- It's shit.

713
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,640
Did you see the boy again?

714
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,239
- Who?
- The boy you hit.

715
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,720
Oh, him.

716
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,880
His family wouldn't let me
see him at the hospital.

717
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,599
You'll try to see him again
to ask forgiveness?

718
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,280
It's important.

719
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:55,960
If you say so.

720
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:13,640
I'm sorry.

721
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,599
<i>Unknown caller</i>

722
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:42,760
<i>I know you went to see my first family.</i>

723
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:44,599
<i>I hope they're well.</i>

724
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,359
Why did you scream?

725
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,760
What frightened you?

726
01:09:01,079 --> 01:09:03,120
<i>You're not like the others.</i>

727
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,960
It's for the program

728
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,280
we'll hand out
on the day of the celebration.

729
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,400
I think we should choose something

730
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,599
that's sincere, simple,

731
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,040
and humble.

732
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,239
What do you think?

733
01:09:58,999 --> 01:10:00,160
This one.

734
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,239
Light shines in you.

735
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:08,640
Or this one. Your gaze...

736
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,599
is very clear. Very pure.

737
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,359
I like this one.

738
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:24,840
Here.

739
01:10:25,239 --> 01:10:27,320
This is Lucie Marisco, a journalist.

740
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:31,960
She investigated
Anna's apparitions for years.

741
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,559
Then last year,
she suddenly quit the newspaper.

742
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,359
- Do you know why?
- Not really.

743
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,239
It seems that her editor
wanted to drop this affair.

744
01:10:42,559 --> 01:10:43,680
Is she Catholic?

745
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,599
No, that's the interesting part.

746
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,480
- Why?
- In her email...

747
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:50,880
she says that no-one really
wanted to know the truth.

748
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,960
The shopkeepers,
the Diocese, the pilgrims, no-one.

749
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,999
She explains
why it's in everyone's interest

750
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,680
to maintain the mystery.

751
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,880
Those who want to believe
and those who don't.

752
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,720
The Bishop wants the truth.

753
01:11:05,999 --> 01:11:08,599
He has no choice anymore.

754
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:11,599
Borrodine is out of control.
They're scared.

755
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,400
The Diocese requested
an analysis of the stained relic.

756
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,280
What more could they do?

757
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,640
Here's everything I found on Borrodine.

758
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,960
A missionary in India, in Asia...

759
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,559
He even started a humanitarian group
in the Philippines.

760
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,120
But I found nothing compromising.

761
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:33,880
On the contrary, people speak
of a sincere, devout servant of God.

762
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,079
Oh, c'mon.

763
01:11:35,239 --> 01:11:38,079
He refuses
to submit to his bishop's authority.

764
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,999
That's enough to discredit him.

765
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:44,920
The prefecture confirms there's no sign
of unlawful conflict of interest.

766
01:11:45,079 --> 01:11:48,400
No hidden funds for him,
the visionary or their entourage.

767
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:49,800
Nothing.

768
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:52,840
What about the man
who's always with him...

769
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,880
Anton Meyer.

770
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,120
He's been there from the start too.

771
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,120
Borrodine is increasingly alone.

772
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:01,480
He needs Meyer's Catholic networks

773
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:04,400
to put pressure on the Bishop.

774
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,480
Do you think Anna is attached to them?

775
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,079
Does she have any choice?

776
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:20,640
Chapter 4
The Icon of Kazan

777
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,520
Hello.

778
01:12:28,599 --> 01:12:29,599
Cécile.

779
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,520
That's her with shorter hair.

780
01:12:37,599 --> 01:12:38,840
That's me.

781
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,720
It's crazy,
she already held her secret.

782
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:47,680
Delphine...

783
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,680
Assata...

784
01:12:49,999 --> 01:12:51,079
Meriem.

785
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,160
Maïa.
She had a serious thyroid problem.

786
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,640
The black guy is Joachim.

787
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,320
He got into trouble and disappeared.

788
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,320
Did Anna have a boyfriend at the time?

789
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,200
No. She never mentioned one.

790
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,440
Not surprising
if she wanted to be a nun.

791
01:13:10,359 --> 01:13:11,880
Look at this list.

792
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:16,440
Are all the girls who were in the home
from 2010 to 2012 on it?

793
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:20,840
Amélie Cassaigne...

794
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:23,120
She went to study in Nancy.

795
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,440
- Glass of water?
- Yes, please.

796
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,920
How do you remember Anna?

797
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,999
We weren't especially friends.

798
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,239
Well, we weren't the same age.

799
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:42,559
And I was a counselor,
so that creates a distance.

800
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,920
But Anna was distant with everyone.

801
01:13:45,079 --> 01:13:47,880
- No-one knew what happened to her?
- Nope.

802
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:52,480
If she'd said she'd seen the Virgin,
we'd have thought she was crazy.

803
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,320
Her life would have been hell.

804
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,559
Those girls are tough with each other.

805
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:00,920
They live in constant fear.

806
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,920
- Who was she closest to?
- Meriem.

807
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,440
Meriem Almedia.

808
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,400
They were roommates towards the end.

809
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,079
They were very close.

810
01:14:13,239 --> 01:14:14,640
Almost inseparable.

811
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,680
Exactly how close?

812
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,160
Not what you think.

813
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:23,359
They were like two sisters
who had lost their parents.

814
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:25,320
You get it?

815
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,760
How can I reach Meriem?

816
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:29,640
No idea.

817
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:32,880
She went to live with a foster family.

818
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,280
Ask the educational worker here.
Maybe he can help you.

819
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:41,200
What did you
think of Father Borrodine?

820
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:43,720
He impressed us with his travel stories.

821
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:47,720
He was super protective of Anna.
Especially when Meriem left.

822
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,400
Why, what happened?

823
01:14:49,559 --> 01:14:52,200
Anna wouldn't leave her room for weeks.

824
01:14:52,359 --> 01:14:54,040
It was really hard on her.

825
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,440
Then one day, she left the home.

826
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:00,999
- To join the convent?
- So they said, but who knows.

827
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:04,400
By becoming a nun,
she escaped administrative checks,

828
01:15:04,559 --> 01:15:06,320
school pressure, and so on.

829
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,239
Do you think there was anything
between Borrodine and Anna?

830
01:15:10,559 --> 01:15:12,320
It always comes down to that?

831
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,720
Sorry, it has to be talked about.

832
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:21,120
Maybe she made it all up for him.
A lovesick kid latching onto someone.

833
01:15:21,599 --> 01:15:25,079
A lovesick kid
doesn't talk about it so easily.

834
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,559
<i>The paper asked
what you were working on.</i>

835
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,520
<i>It's only natural. They're worried.</i>

836
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,120
I don't want to tell them.

837
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,760
Not now, anyway.

838
01:16:05,239 --> 01:16:07,120
They're clueless.

839
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:11,160
<i>How's your ear?</i>

840
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:12,920
Fine.

841
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:14,999
<i>Any more attacks?</i>

842
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,440
Huh?

843
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,999
<i>Do you feel OK?</i>

844
01:16:21,999 --> 01:16:23,599
Yeah. Why?

845
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:27,280
<i>- You just don't want to talk to me?</i>
- Of course I do.

846
01:16:28,559 --> 01:16:30,880
Gabriel has exams, right?

847
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:35,640
<i>I looked up Anna's face on the Internet.</i>

848
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,320
And?

849
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,760
<i>It's scary.</i>

850
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:46,480
<i>What'll her life be like after this?</i>

851
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,559
I don't know.

852
01:16:51,559 --> 01:16:54,520
I'm investigating
the events at Carbarat.

853
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:57,520
You were in the same home
as Anna in 2012-13.

854
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,960
It's a canonical investigation.

855
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:04,359
The Church asked me to investigate

856
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,640
everyone who'd been close to Anna.

857
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,280
I'd like to ask you

858
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,680
a few questions
and hear your memories

859
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:12,120
of Anna.

860
01:17:12,559 --> 01:17:13,760
Ah, moved.

861
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,440
About half an hour from you.

862
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:19,599
Stéphanie Berlamont?

863
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:21,079
OK.

864
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:22,960
Marie-Amélie Jacob?

865
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,880
Delphine Barjoux?

866
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,559
How can I reach her?

867
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:29,280
I was told she'd moved away.

868
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,840
...11-24-52.

869
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,640
Where's La Roche des Arnaux?
I'm a bit lost.

870
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,079
Maïa Lonkeu? You're sure?

871
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:43,760
I can come to your home or workplace.

872
01:17:44,599 --> 01:17:45,599
Paris?

873
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:47,800
No, no.

874
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:50,999
I can be there in half an hour.

875
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:55,120
Don't worry, just a few questions.
It won't take long.

876
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,720
That's Meriem.

877
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,400
And that's her boyfriend.

878
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,480
Who was her boyfriend?

879
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:19,280
A guy she met in an association.

880
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,800
A Russian guy.

881
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:23,320
What kind of association?

882
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,239
They help people.

883
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:29,120
People who are on their own or poor.

884
01:18:29,559 --> 01:18:31,200
Even prisoners.

885
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,720
- Was she a prison visitor?
- Yes.

886
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,680
Did she talk to you about Anna...

887
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,800
and the apparitions?

888
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:43,960
No.

889
01:18:43,999 --> 01:18:45,160
Never.

890
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,280
We heard it all later.

891
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:52,320
So, after the foster home,
they lost contact?

892
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:54,880
Well, I never saw them together.

893
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:56,960
She never came here.

894
01:18:57,280 --> 01:18:58,840
Maybe they met up, though.

895
01:18:58,999 --> 01:19:00,480
What was his name?

896
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,760
Pavel.

897
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:04,880
Know his last name?

898
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:08,599
No. I'm not even sure
Pavel was his real name.

899
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,400
Oh, why do you say that?

900
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,400
Dunno.

901
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,840
What did he do for a living?

902
01:19:14,999 --> 01:19:16,720
He was an ex-soldier.

903
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:18,520
A drifter.

904
01:19:19,239 --> 01:19:21,120
They're in the top drawer.

905
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:32,920
Here's a letter we received
after they left.

906
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,400
A prisoner she visited.

907
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:36,720
Lumio.

908
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,280
He was worried
when he didn't hear from her.

909
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,920
Wanted to know where she'd gone.

910
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,680
Gaspard Lumio.

911
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,239
That's it.

912
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:48,599
What was her relationship
with the prisoner?

913
01:19:49,559 --> 01:19:51,599
She went to talk to him.

914
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,999
About the Gospels and forgiveness...

915
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,680
She always wanted to help everyone.

916
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,239
Did she say
she wanted to become a nun?

917
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:03,359
Meriem? On the contrary!

918
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:06,120
She wanted to travel, see the world.

919
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:08,120
She was always running around.

920
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,280
And she was in love.

921
01:20:13,599 --> 01:20:15,880
- Mind if I take this letter?
- No.

922
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,680
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

923
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,640
You'll give it back, right?

924
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:32,960
What's that?

925
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:36,320
A gift from Pavel.
When they left, he gave it to us.

926
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,680
Did he say where he found it?

927
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,880
When he was a soldier, I guess.

928
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,239
It was broken. He repaired it.

929
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:55,079
- May I take a photo of it?
- OK.

930
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,400
What do you mean "by chance"!

931
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:44,079
<i>A coincidence. It happens.</i>

932
01:21:45,599 --> 01:21:48,200
Coming across this thing, Céline,

933
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:49,960
in a godforsaken place.

934
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:51,480
It's impossible!

935
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:53,960
<i>- You're imagining things!</i>
- No, I'm not!

936
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,280
It's right in front of me!

937
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,040
<i>What are you scared of?</i>

938
01:21:58,999 --> 01:22:00,320
I don't know.

939
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,480
I don't know.

940
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:34,920
Anna, I have to talk to you.
Who's Meriem?

941
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,040
What happened with Meriem?

942
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:39,800
Who's Meriem?

943
01:22:56,359 --> 01:22:59,040
<i>Unknown caller</i>

944
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:16,120
Did he tell you
about his photographer friend?

945
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:19,400
I know the story,
but not from him personally.

946
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:23,599
It's unpleasant,
someone who won't answer you.

947
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,920
What do you think, Father?

948
01:23:27,999 --> 01:23:30,320
Faith often travels incognito.

949
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:38,559
Hello.

950
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,720
I can't be seen here.

951
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:43,440
Come in.

952
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,680
Want a drink?

953
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,920
- Yes, please.
- A glass of water?

954
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:58,160
Hang your jacket up.

955
01:24:14,359 --> 01:24:16,160
- Here.
- Thanks.

956
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,680
Are you free to go out
when you like?

957
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:23,160
Father Borrodine asked me
not to speak to you.

958
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,040
You disobey him?

959
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:31,599
People saw what happened
at the gymnasium.

960
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,520
You seemed angry.

961
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:36,040
Father Borrodine talked to me about it.

962
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:37,920
What did he say?

963
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:41,559
He'd rather pray
than listen to people who attack us.

964
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:44,160
Who's attacking you?

965
01:24:44,599 --> 01:24:46,280
People who are afraid.

966
01:24:49,079 --> 01:24:51,440
- Are you afraid of him?
- No.

967
01:24:51,599 --> 01:24:53,359
He's always protected me.

968
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:58,920
Does all that scare you?

969
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,239
A little, yes.

970
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,760
But I have faith.

971
01:25:08,559 --> 01:25:10,480
I want to help you, Jacques.

972
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,320
Help me?

973
01:25:15,999 --> 01:25:18,480
This investigation
mustn't make you suffer.

974
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:22,680
The message the Virgin gave me
is one of love and peace.

975
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,359
I know you need a friend.

976
01:25:30,559 --> 01:25:32,040
Sit down.

977
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,040
Tell me about Meriem.

978
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,880
She was my friend in the home.

979
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,440
Why did she leave?

980
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,040
Because she wanted to leave.

981
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:02,920
Did you know
about her Russian boyfriend, Pavel?

982
01:26:03,079 --> 01:26:05,040
Her boyfriend? No.

983
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:06,880
How could I have known?

984
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:12,880
You've never had a sweetheart?

985
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:16,680
I know I'll always be a virgin.

986
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:18,960
I've known it for a long time.

987
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:21,559
It's what gives my life meaning.

988
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:22,999
It's God I love.

989
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,480
Doesn't it bother you...

990
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,920
not to know...

991
01:26:29,079 --> 01:26:32,160
what it's like to make love
to a boy, or a girl?

992
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:33,840
Isn't it painful?

993
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:37,440
It's a beautiful pain.

994
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,599
Very beautiful, even.

995
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,120
There's...

996
01:26:48,559 --> 01:26:51,359
a guy who says he heard you scream

997
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,880
on the path,
after the apparitions.

998
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:55,280
Scream?

999
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,880
No, I didn't scream.
Why would I scream?

1000
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:59,999
I don't know.
That's what I heard.

1001
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:02,599
I didn't scream.

1002
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:07,200
So he's lying, too?

1003
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:11,040
People make things up
when it comes to apparitions.

1004
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:12,880
I've heard all sorts.

1005
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:17,559
I just want to understand
why he said that.

1006
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:20,079
Why did Meriem suddenly disappear?

1007
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:25,079
And why do I have the feeling
that all your answers are scripted?

1008
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:31,720
There's too much anger in you
to accept what I saw.

1009
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,599
I came here to ask you something.

1010
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,760
The commission wants to analyze
the bloodstained cloth.

1011
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:46,960
You have no right. It's sacred.

1012
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:50,120
It's not up to me anymore.
I can't help you.

1013
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:52,720
I beg you, don't touch it!

1014
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,320
Stand up, Anna.

1015
01:27:54,559 --> 01:27:56,880
- I want to help you.
- Stop it.

1016
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,120
- Please!
- Stand up, Anna.

1017
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:02,040
- You have no right! Please!
- Don't do this.

1018
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:04,239
Please stand up.

1019
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,239
- Promise me.
- Get up.

1020
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:11,760
It's out of my hands.

1021
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,480
Are you OK?

1022
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:30,880
Sorry, I'll be right out.

1023
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,480
- How will you get home?
- I'll walk.

1024
01:29:03,079 --> 01:29:04,480
It's not far.

1025
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:08,520
Will you come
to the celebration next week?

1026
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:11,280
Do you want me to?

1027
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:14,160
Yes. It's important that you be there.

1028
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,760
Thank you.

1029
01:30:41,559 --> 01:30:44,480
I know
the Mother of God will protect us.

1030
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:01,320
Her name was Safia Ayad.

1031
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:04,400
A-Y-A-D.

1032
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:07,920
It happened in 2005.

1033
01:31:08,559 --> 01:31:11,920
I only have his name,
not the name of the prison.

1034
01:31:12,079 --> 01:31:14,079
Gaspard Lumio.

1035
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:18,920
Gaspard Lumio. L-U-M-I-O.

1036
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:23,559
Do you have a number
where I can reach his lawyer?

1037
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:39,120
You don't look well.

1038
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:41,559
You haven't finished your food.

1039
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:44,440
Do you want to talk?

1040
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,320
We could have a chat.

1041
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:57,239
I'm only asking for a simple blessing.

1042
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:00,320
It won't take long, I promise you.

1043
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:04,999
Look, all our gifts

1044
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,359
for the parishes that support us.

1045
01:32:08,999 --> 01:32:10,760
Just a simple blessing.

1046
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,800
But they need to know

1047
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,599
that you touched the objects.

1048
01:32:43,999 --> 01:32:45,800
Safia was 25 when she died.

1049
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,640
No family came forward.

1050
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,999
I was the one who had her buried.

1051
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:52,079
There's the autopsy report.

1052
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:57,239
She was born in '82 in Djelfa, Algeria.

1053
01:32:57,999 --> 01:32:59,760
- A Muslim, then.
- Yes.

1054
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:03,880
She lived with some lowlife
who abandoned her with a baby.

1055
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:06,440
She gave it to social services.

1056
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:10,599
Then she drifted here and there,
in the region.

1057
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:14,440
So, she had a baby
in around '97 or '98.

1058
01:33:14,599 --> 01:33:16,239
Was it a boy or a girl?

1059
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,520
A girl.

1060
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:21,640
A girl of 17 or 18
regularly visited Lumio in prison.

1061
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,280
I have her photo.

1062
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:27,559
Look.

1063
01:33:28,999 --> 01:33:30,239
Meriem.

1064
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:31,999
Meriem Almedia.

1065
01:33:34,559 --> 01:33:35,800
Is that her real name?

1066
01:33:35,960 --> 01:33:37,920
I think so. I'm not sure.

1067
01:33:38,599 --> 01:33:41,520
- You know nothing else about her?
- No.

1068
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,999
Seems she wanted to disappear.

1069
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:48,280
I have to run. I'm due in court.

1070
01:33:48,559 --> 01:33:51,079
- Good luck. Call me if...
- OK.

1071
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:09,239
Is there a letter for me?

1072
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:31,480
When did you last eat?

1073
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,840
How far will you take this?

1074
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:01,040
<i>I think of you every day.</i>

1075
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:04,720
<i>I'm waiting for you now
and in the next life. Meriem.</i>

1076
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:30,079
I was afraid you'd get lost.

1077
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:34,840
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1078
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:38,760
Do you come here often?

1079
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,680
When I want to be alone.

1080
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,840
Do you often want to be alone?

1081
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:48,559
Sometimes.

1082
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:04,320
Isn't it beautiful, with the mountains?

1083
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:07,120
Can you hear the river?

1084
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:11,200
Have you been home recently?

1085
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,200
Not since I've been here.

1086
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:15,880
Don't you miss your family?

1087
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:20,320
Yes, but... in the meantime
it's better for them I'm far away.

1088
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,160
"In the meantime"?

1089
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,239
Are you asking the questions today?

1090
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:27,239
I don't know.
I'm trying to get to know you.

1091
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,920
We don't have to talk
about your investigation.

1092
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,520
You have your notebook with you?

1093
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:40,640
Ever hear the story
of the antique dealer's son?

1094
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:42,800
When the antique dealer died,

1095
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:45,999
his son inherited
his shop and everything in it.

1096
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:49,559
On the desk, he found an envelope
that said "Do not open."

1097
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:54,720
He thought it was his father's last wish,
so he didn't open it.

1098
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,480
For years, he wondered what was inside.

1099
01:36:57,640 --> 01:36:59,680
When he reached his father's age,

1100
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:02,720
he decided to open
the mysterious envelope.

1101
01:37:02,999 --> 01:37:04,840
You know what he found?

1102
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,440
Dozens of labels that said
"Do not open."

1103
01:37:08,599 --> 01:37:12,680
His father stuck them on the boxes
he sold in his shop.

1104
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:13,999
Not bad.

1105
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:25,400
You never tried to find your parents?

1106
01:37:25,559 --> 01:37:26,680
No.

1107
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:28,520
I found a family.

1108
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:30,280
A family I chose.

1109
01:37:33,559 --> 01:37:34,960
Are you in pain?

1110
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:38,999
Where?

1111
01:37:39,239 --> 01:37:40,440
My ear.

1112
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:50,520
It feels like someone's shoving a...

1113
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:52,120
I thought it was over.

1114
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:56,239
Don't be afraid. It'll pass.

1115
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:27,999
Finally,
I'm filled with love and desire.

1116
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:31,120
I offer You my body and my soul, Lord.

1117
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:34,200
My love has become an inferno.

1118
01:38:34,359 --> 01:38:36,920
Like a flame, it will rise to the Heavens

1119
01:38:37,079 --> 01:38:38,720
when my time comes,

1120
01:38:39,079 --> 01:38:41,040
and I will know love...

1121
01:38:41,359 --> 01:38:42,520
at last.

1122
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:49,880
You have no right!

1123
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:51,520
Don't touch it.

1124
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:55,880
Leave it alone.

1125
01:38:57,359 --> 01:38:59,200
Careful, sir.

1126
01:39:00,999 --> 01:39:02,359
You have no right.

1127
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,559
- You're in the house of God!
- Stop!

1128
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:05,720
Stop!

1129
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:08,920
- Stop!
- Don't touch it, it's sacred!

1130
01:39:09,079 --> 01:39:11,160
Stop! Stop!

1131
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:13,280
Stop it! Don't touch it!

1132
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:18,840
Stop...

1133
01:39:25,559 --> 01:39:27,359
Don't film that.

1134
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,120
She refuses to eat, Father.

1135
01:40:15,559 --> 01:40:19,640
I know you secretly met
with that reporter from the commission.

1136
01:40:22,599 --> 01:40:24,480
What happened between you?

1137
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:31,120
Is there anything I should know about?

1138
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:52,999
Chapter 5
Revelation

1139
01:40:59,999 --> 01:41:03,160
Praise be to God!
All the Internet links are working.

1140
01:41:04,079 --> 01:41:05,359
Hello, Father.

1141
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:12,359
More than 15 prayer groups

1142
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:15,400
will be connected
with us in the United States.

1143
01:41:15,559 --> 01:41:17,559
A dozen in Holland,

1144
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:20,599
in Austria... and in France, obviously.

1145
01:41:21,239 --> 01:41:22,359
Look.

1146
01:41:34,999 --> 01:41:36,640
How is she today?

1147
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:48,920
It's only when the pilgrims
started coming in great numbers,

1148
01:41:49,079 --> 01:41:52,640
that the Church became
interested in Bernadette's apparitions.

1149
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:58,760
The faithful have always been
ahead of the Church.

1150
01:41:59,559 --> 01:42:01,520
And it's the same here.

1151
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:04,120
The faithful are with us.

1152
01:42:04,999 --> 01:42:06,239
I know.

1153
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:13,400
You think she'll be able to come?

1154
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:16,480
I think that commission is poison.

1155
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:19,200
A test for us.

1156
01:42:23,599 --> 01:42:24,800
Evil...

1157
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,400
The spirit of Evil.

1158
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:29,960
It's in each of us.

1159
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,880
I found your letter

1160
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:19,079
at Meriem's foster home.

1161
01:43:21,640 --> 01:43:23,480
I know she came to see you.

1162
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:30,800
Have you heard from her recently?

1163
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:35,880
Do you know where she is?

1164
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:44,280
Is she Safia's daughter?

1165
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:37,720
Can you hear me?

1166
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:54,520
You must eat, Anna.

1167
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:57,880
Do you hear me?

1168
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,800
Your attitude is too proud.

1169
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:22,040
Maybe Meriem knew something,
but she left or was forced to go.

1170
01:45:22,359 --> 01:45:25,079
We were asked
to investigate an apparition,

1171
01:45:25,239 --> 01:45:27,040
not some sordid murder.

1172
01:45:28,079 --> 01:45:29,720
What if they were linked?

1173
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:33,840
We'd be far from the
canonical principles of an apparition.

1174
01:45:33,999 --> 01:45:35,720
Canonical principles?

1175
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:37,999
Meriem's mother was murdered.

1176
01:45:38,359 --> 01:45:41,239
The daughter
visited the murderer in prison.

1177
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:45,320
They became friends.
She wrote him about faith, forgiveness.

1178
01:45:45,999 --> 01:45:47,680
Her mother's murderer!

1179
01:45:48,079 --> 01:45:49,760
Anna's best friend!

1180
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,239
For a Christian, it's only natural.

1181
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:53,400
She disappeared

1182
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:56,320
when the apparitions began.
That's not a sign?

1183
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:58,640
A sign?
You believe in signs now?

1184
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,079
- That's new!
- It's none of our business.

1185
01:46:01,239 --> 01:46:05,680
It's my business, because it's outside
your frame of reference!

1186
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,400
Your "canonical principles"

1187
01:46:07,559 --> 01:46:11,040
are perhaps what's obscuring
the simple reality.

1188
01:46:11,200 --> 01:46:13,999
You don't understand our mission.

1189
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:15,640
Yes, I do!

1190
01:46:18,559 --> 01:46:22,200
If I was asked to investigate,
it was to work differently.

1191
01:46:22,359 --> 01:46:24,559
To get back to something concrete.

1192
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:28,160
Oh yes, you're in the "real world."
Only, it doesn't exist.

1193
01:46:28,559 --> 01:46:31,920
It's an illusion.
The truth is never what you think.

1194
01:46:32,079 --> 01:46:33,640
You don't get it!

1195
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:36,520
I need to know
if I was lied to or not.

1196
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:41,079
If I can believe
what that girl says or not.

1197
01:46:41,239 --> 01:46:43,480
I want facts, proof.

1198
01:46:52,359 --> 01:46:53,559
Sorry.

1199
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,400
<i>Unknown caller</i>

1200
01:47:14,440 --> 01:47:16,200
<i>Will you be there tomorrow?</i>

1201
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:20,760
Yes, I will.

1202
01:47:23,599 --> 01:47:25,239
<i>Will you come see me?</i>

1203
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,079
Yes.

1204
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:31,239
How are you feeling?

1205
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:33,800
Can I do anything?

1206
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:38,040
<i>Martyrdom is a reward, Jacques.</i>

1207
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:40,920
<i>I hope I deserve to suffer this much.</i>

1208
01:47:41,599 --> 01:47:42,599
<i>Thank you.</i>

1209
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:57,640
Get back! Give her some air!

1210
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:58,800
Move back.

1211
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,359
Give her room to breathe.

1212
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:04,960
Let's get her out of here.
Hold her.

1213
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:06,920
Step aside!

1214
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:11,760
Leave us alone.

1215
01:49:12,640 --> 01:49:13,760
Come on!

1216
01:49:15,599 --> 01:49:16,760
Out of the way!

1217
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:21,040
Dear brothers and sisters...

1218
01:49:22,599 --> 01:49:26,400
It's a very heavy burden

1219
01:49:26,999 --> 01:49:30,680
to be chosen by the Mother of God

1220
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:32,160
as her messenger.

1221
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:42,999
Though the soul is strong,
the body is weak.

1222
01:49:43,559 --> 01:49:44,840
Let us pray for her.

1223
01:50:12,359 --> 01:50:13,999
Breathe normally.

1224
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:15,760
Breathe.

1225
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:22,440
When did you last eat?

1226
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:29,880
Thank you, Doctor.

1227
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:44,280
How is she?

1228
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:58,720
I think you're dangerous.

1229
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:04,079
I think you're empty.

1230
01:51:07,480 --> 01:51:09,239
I can see it in your eyes.

1231
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:50,840
The Diocese has authorized me
to share my conclusions,

1232
01:51:50,999 --> 01:51:53,520
but my report must remain confidential.

1233
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:57,840
First, the analysis of the fabric.

1234
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:01,440
Undoubtedly a torn sheet,
judging by the edges.

1235
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:06,440
It's a common mass-produced,
contemporary textile.

1236
01:52:07,079 --> 01:52:08,999
A cotton and linen blend.

1237
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:12,880
An ordinary sheet
you can buy anywhere.

1238
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:17,120
And the blood?

1239
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:19,800
It belongs to a human male,

1240
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:22,280
but we can't date the sample.

1241
01:52:22,440 --> 01:52:23,840
Not with dried blood.

1242
01:52:23,999 --> 01:52:25,960
- Did you get a DNA sample?
- Yes.

1243
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:30,800
According to the DNA,
it's a Caucasian male in his thirties.

1244
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:34,840
No matches in your database
or the police files?

1245
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:37,640
I don't have access to police files.

1246
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:41,320
But what seems interesting
for your investigation,

1247
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:43,800
is that the blood type is AB+.

1248
01:52:44,120 --> 01:52:45,520
AB+?

1249
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:47,559
Why is that interesting?

1250
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:51,200
It's the same blood type
found in several sacred relics.

1251
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:52,999
And?

1252
01:52:53,160 --> 01:52:56,920
The AB+ blood type
has been found on various relics.

1253
01:52:57,400 --> 01:52:58,520
The Turin Shroud,

1254
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:01,760
the Holy Tunic of Argenteuil,

1255
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:04,480
and the Shroud of Oviedo.

1256
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:09,320
And they've been scientifically
authenticated as belonging to Christ?

1257
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:12,720
No. The Church allows
the faithful to venerate them,

1258
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:15,800
but does not guarantee
the factual truth.

1259
01:53:30,599 --> 01:53:33,160
What were you hoping for? Proof?

1260
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:34,880
Proof of what?

1261
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:38,160
If there were proof,
there'd be no choice.

1262
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:40,079
No mystery.

1263
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:43,880
Faith is a free, enlightened choice.

1264
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:48,200
You choose to believe in the mystery.
You don't need proof, relics,

1265
01:53:48,359 --> 01:53:50,320
- blood types...
- There's no mystery.

1266
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:52,480
We've been fed nonsense!

1267
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:56,720
Just a big lie,
with mass-produced fabrics.

1268
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:59,400
And cranks.
Nothing to do with faith!

1269
01:54:00,559 --> 01:54:02,760
You've never believed in her sincerity?

1270
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:03,920
Why should I?

1271
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:06,800
Why should I believe in it? Why?

1272
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:19,559
Dear brothers and sisters...

1273
01:54:20,079 --> 01:54:22,640
The great sin of the modern world

1274
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:24,800
is perhaps...

1275
01:54:25,559 --> 01:54:28,079
its refusal of the invisible.

1276
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:35,040
In its search for banal proof
of the great mystery,

1277
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:38,640
the Canonical Investigation Commission

1278
01:54:39,359 --> 01:54:41,999
has multiplied errors,

1279
01:54:42,599 --> 01:54:43,880
blunders,

1280
01:54:44,559 --> 01:54:46,120
and humiliations.

1281
01:54:47,999 --> 01:54:49,160
But...

1282
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:51,559
the Spirit of might is in Anna.

1283
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:54,400
Today, we know

1284
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:57,359
that a great destiny awaits her.

1285
01:54:58,640 --> 01:54:59,960
For her...

1286
01:55:00,999 --> 01:55:03,040
the truth is obvious.

1287
01:55:05,559 --> 01:55:07,040
Sainthood.

1288
01:55:12,599 --> 01:55:13,840
<i>It's very simple.</i>

1289
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:18,040
<i>These images of Mother Teresa</i>

1290
01:55:18,200 --> 01:55:19,680
<i>moved me,</i>

1291
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:21,120
<i>like many other people.</i>

1292
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:23,559
<i>That was the true reason</i>

1293
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:25,840
<i>I chose to live this life.</i>

1294
01:55:31,559 --> 01:55:34,880
WHO ARE THE FRENCH PRIESTS
IN AFRICA?

1295
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:44,320
<i>In 1981, the final report
of the investigation</i>

1296
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:46,559
<i>into the Turin Shroud provided</i>

1297
01:55:46,720 --> 01:55:48,320
<i>a decisive answer.</i>

1298
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:52,520
<i>What we know is
that the blood type is clearly AB+.</i>

1299
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:56,920
I'M THE SAME BLOOD TYPE AS CHRIST!

1300
01:55:57,359 --> 01:55:59,880
<i>People still have
that blood group today.</i>

1301
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:02,239
<i>I myself am AB+.</i>

1302
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:16,160
What is it, Jacques?

1303
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,640
The shroud was him. Anton.

1304
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:20,880
He invented it.

1305
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:24,239
Where are you?
Do you want me to come?

1306
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:27,920
- For the rest, I don't know.
<i>- You need sleep.</i>

1307
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:31,840
What did she see?
What happened with Meriem?

1308
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:51,800
Why do you think she's gone missing?

1309
01:56:51,999 --> 01:56:54,520
She'd never go off without telling me.

1310
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:58,320
She's never done that.

1311
01:57:00,160 --> 01:57:01,160
Never.

1312
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:13,120
We have no news.

1313
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:16,920
- Have you called the hospital?
- She's not there.

1314
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:19,760
They're trying to silence her.

1315
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:22,880
We must do something. I'll go.

1316
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:24,999
- It doesn't concern us.
- Really?

1317
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:47,239
<i>Unknown caller</i>

1318
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:02,720
Are you Jacques?

1319
01:59:05,999 --> 01:59:06,999
Where is she?

1320
01:59:08,280 --> 01:59:09,760
Do you know?

1321
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:15,320
She told me to give you this.

1322
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:18,760
<i>Do Not Open</i>

1323
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:50,280
Can you hear me?

1324
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:52,200
Say something.

1325
02:01:13,079 --> 02:01:15,280
Miss, keep your eyes open.

1326
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:17,040
Miss!

1327
02:01:17,239 --> 02:01:19,720
- Keep your eyes open!
- Her pulse is weak.

1328
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:24,320
Blood pressure: 70/40.

1329
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:26,120
Heart rate: 130.

1330
02:01:26,559 --> 02:01:29,079
Respiratory distress syndrome.

1331
02:01:47,599 --> 02:01:49,720
- She's desaturating.
- She's cold.

1332
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:51,599
There's still a pulse.

1333
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:54,079
- Pressure drop.
- She's pulling it out!

1334
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:57,160
Bradycardia!

1335
02:01:57,320 --> 02:01:58,359
I've got nothing.

1336
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:00,040
Stay with us.

1337
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:11,520
I'm the one who needed her.

1338
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:21,359
Did he give you the cloth?

1339
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:26,160
It was just a symbol.

1340
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:29,320
Who is he?

1341
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:31,160
A charlatan?

1342
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:35,079
Someone who lost his way.

1343
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:46,239
I lost my way, too.

1344
02:03:57,200 --> 02:03:58,760
So, did she lie?

1345
02:04:01,559 --> 02:04:03,280
That's not for me to say.

1346
02:04:06,359 --> 02:04:07,800
But you know?

1347
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:11,520
Not yet.

1348
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:20,760
Chapter 6
Meriem

1349
02:04:27,079 --> 02:04:28,359
<i>Your Grace,</i>

1350
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:31,599
<i>I am sending you
the elements of the investigation</i>

1351
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:34,079
<i>for which
you requested my assistance.</i>

1352
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:38,239
<i>They include the interviews,
witness statements,</i>

1353
02:04:38,400 --> 02:04:41,359
<i>and reports of the experts
I consulted with</i>

1354
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:43,640
<i>on Anna's alleged apparitions.</i>

1355
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:49,079
<i>You may now draw your own conclusions.</i>

1356
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:53,200
<i>I think of her,</i>

1357
02:04:54,120 --> 02:04:55,920
<i>of those who loved her...</i>

1358
02:04:57,559 --> 02:05:00,079
<i>of those who want
to believe in her miracle.</i>

1359
02:05:04,559 --> 02:05:06,760
<i>I think of what she was for me...</i>

1360
02:05:06,920 --> 02:05:07,920
<i>for us.</i>

1361
02:05:13,160 --> 02:05:15,280
<i>She took her secret with her.</i>

1362
02:05:19,079 --> 02:05:20,880
<i>I'm going back home,</i>

1363
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:24,960
<i>to my family, my life, my work.</i>

1364
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:30,200
<i>Thank you for giving me this mission.</i>

1365
02:05:30,840 --> 02:05:33,120
<i>It raised questions I'd never imagined.</i>

1366
02:05:35,079 --> 02:05:37,160
<i>I don't have the answers.</i>

1367
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:43,160
<i>I think of the improbable story
of an angel</i>

1368
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:47,720
<i>who came to tell a virgin
that she was carrying God's son.</i>

1369
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:52,680
<i>I think of my late friend,</i>

1370
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:56,640
<i>a photographer who spent his life
searching for visible proof,</i>

1371
02:05:57,760 --> 02:05:59,400
<i>images of truth...</i>

1372
02:06:01,999 --> 02:06:03,040
<i>What truth?</i>

1373
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:04,840
<i>What images?</i>

1374
02:06:08,999 --> 02:06:11,760
<i>Perhaps the truth
is never what you think.</i>

1375
02:06:16,480 --> 02:06:19,599
<i>How can we believe
in what eludes our gaze?</i>

1376
02:06:24,680 --> 02:06:27,520
<i>I've seen so many things
around the world,</i>

1377
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:31,040
<i>but with Anna,
I discovered a world I didn't know.</i>

1378
02:06:38,920 --> 02:06:41,559
<i>I know now, souls have their own world.</i>

1379
02:06:43,880 --> 02:06:45,999
<i>I knew nothing of that world.</i>

1380
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:53,320
<i>Please accept, Your Grace,</i>

1381
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:55,840
<i>my very best regards,</i>

1382
02:06:57,559 --> 02:06:59,079
<i>Jacques Mayano.</i>

1383
02:08:19,559 --> 02:08:20,559
Hello.

1384
02:08:21,800 --> 02:08:22,999
Can I help you?

1385
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:28,599
I came to talk about Anna.

1386
02:09:03,120 --> 02:09:04,840
She gave me the letters.

1387
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:09,359
Anna didn't see anything.

1388
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:13,480
It was you.

1389
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:18,640
You're the one who screamed.

1390
02:09:21,599 --> 02:09:23,720
I screamed because I was afraid.

1391
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:28,920
I don't know...

1392
02:09:30,120 --> 02:09:31,760
It was too much for me.

1393
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:34,520
No-one would've believed me.

1394
02:09:36,239 --> 02:09:37,320
I wanted to leave,

1395
02:09:37,880 --> 02:09:39,359
have a baby.

1396
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:44,520
Not be trapped by it all.

1397
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:48,559
So Anna sacrificed herself.

1398
02:09:52,280 --> 02:09:54,040
She did it to save me,

1399
02:09:54,559 --> 02:09:56,160
so I could live.

1400
02:10:00,559 --> 02:10:02,120
She was my friend.

1401
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:09,320
Do you believe me?

1402
02:10:12,920 --> 02:10:14,440
I don't know.

1403
02:10:18,760 --> 02:10:21,320
I was there
when your friend took the photo.

1404
02:10:21,559 --> 02:10:22,920
With the girl.

1405
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:26,400
I remember him.

1406
02:10:27,840 --> 02:10:29,320
We spoke.

1407
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:32,400
He wasn't afraid.

1408
02:10:35,359 --> 02:10:38,520
- You remember where the church was?
- Not a church.

1409
02:10:39,680 --> 02:10:41,280
A monastery.

1410
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:43,800
They destroyed it.

1411
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:51,999
It's faraway.

1412
02:10:56,200 --> 02:10:57,880
The other side of the border.

1413
02:10:58,239 --> 02:10:59,559
It's dangerous.

1414
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:00,880
I'll see.
