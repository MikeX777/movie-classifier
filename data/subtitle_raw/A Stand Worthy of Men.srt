1
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:34,125
Don't move!

2
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,375
This won't do, Mr. Adel.

3
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:38,166
Lower your voice, Sayed.

4
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,392
- We're in intensive care.
- Really?

5
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,250
We're in intensive care?
Nobody told me!

6
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:42,666
If so, why are you here?

7
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,958
Visiting hours
aren't for another 45 minutes.

8
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,875
What difference will 45 minutes make?
Nobody will notice.

9
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:51,041
They will notice, and I will get
into trouble and be punished.

10
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:53,833
Please, go sit in the waiting area
until visiting hours.

11
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay, Sayed. Okay.

12
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,583
That would be great, sir.

13
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,583
Get me
the "x-bex-fistin" injection, quickly!

14
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,833
Why are you staring at me? Hurry!

15
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,458
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.

16
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,375
You look like a complete wreck.

17
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:38,333
Do this so God can bless you,
and you can be healed.

18
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,916
Come on. Slowly, slowly.

19
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,083
Dear God!

20
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,166
Did someone get the number of the car
that hit him?

21
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:45,648
- It was a train accident.
- Did someone get the train number?

22
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:46,875
Open up!

23
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,434
- Go ahead, Doctor.
- Open up quickly!

24
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:49,458
Go ahead.

25
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,166
There is no God but Allah!
There is no God but Allah!

26
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,041
Really, Adel?

27
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,083
What if they caught you?

28
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,166
Why would they catch me?
I'm dressed like a doctor.

29
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,041
What is a doctor
other than a coat, stethoscope and cap?

30
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:07,666
And good looks!

31
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,666
Plus, a one-hour visit
isn't enough, Abeer.

32
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,625
I can't get enough of you.

33
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:17,041
But you know what? You look better today.

34
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,625
You're glowing. Your face is smiling.

35
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:21,833
I'll tell the doctor
to move you to a regular room.

36
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,125
He comes at seven o'clock, right?
What time is it now?

37
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,875
Why are you asking about the time?

38
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,833
Where's your phone?
Did you damage it again?

39
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:32,458
No, I swear I didn't.
I switched it off and left it at home.

40
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:35,250
- Why did you switch it off?
- Who calls me besides you?

41
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,875
You're the only one
who calls me and checks up on me.

42
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,875
The phone is just an annoyance.

43
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:41,958
And, honestly,

44
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:44,875
I only like you annoying me, you beauty.

45
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,250
I really miss home, Adel.

46
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,625
We're so close, Abeer.

47
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:57,625
We're so close.
The doctor reassured me, I swear.

48
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,625
I promise, as soon as you're better,

49
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,083
I'll take you on the back of the Harley.

50
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,125
- Did you really get a motorbike?
- I'm picking it up tomorrow.

51
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,333
- You did what you wanted.
- I'll tell you what, Abeer.

52
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,083
It's been my dream
since I was 20 years old

53
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,208
to ride a Harley with the big handles,

54
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,166
take a pretty girl behind me
and go to Ras El Bar.

55
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:24,291
That was 40 years ago, Abeer.

56
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:27,000
How about we go to El Gouna now?

57
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:31,500
Yesterday,
I found you an amazing pink helmet.

58
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,708
A pink helmet for me?

59
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,958
I want to see your size.

60
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,875
This is too much, Mr. Adel.

61
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,750
What's this? Sorry, I didn't realize.
I will go and come back.

62
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:44,250
No, it's nothing. Come back.

63
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,375
I'm putting eyedrops in for her.

64
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,166
Oh, eyedrops, yeah.

65
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,208
Mr. Adel, don't you think it's a bit much
what you're doing every day to come early?

66
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,791
And, Mr. Adel, excuse me,
but I'm in nursing.

67
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,833
You can hide all you want,
but I'll find you out.

68
00:05:57,916 --> 00:05:59,708
- What do you mean?
- The prescription.

69
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,333
How about you let me in tomorrow
with no issues,

70
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:05,000
and I'll get you a free gym membership?

71
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,166
In that case, we have a deal.
Why didn't you say that earlier?

72
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,625
Okay, but leave now.
You've already had an extra ten minutes.

73
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,958
Please. For my sake.

74
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,708
Give us another five minutes.

75
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:19,125
All right, you've got another 15 minutes.
But no eyedrops!

76
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,958
- Good morning, Grandpa.
- Listen, Metwally... Good morning, Yousef.

77
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,750
I got your sweets. Don't nag.

78
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:37,833
- Did you get a strawberry lollipop?
- It's in the bags.

79
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,166
Listen, sir.

80
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,208
I want you to submit
my service extension request

81
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,541
and have it on the minister's desk
tomorrow morning.

82
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,833
Is that clear, Metwally?
I know how smart you are.

83
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,250
Why are you speechless?

84
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,541
You got it? Yes.

85
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,708
In the drawer on the left,
there's a pack of papers.

86
00:06:55,791 --> 00:07:00,041
Take three, as I know you'll make
a mistake when writing down the request.

87
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,000
Dad, why didn't you get plums?

88
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,458
- Plums?
- Uncle.

89
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:04,666
Not you, Mr. Metwally.

90
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,125
The pears you brought yesterday
aren't Khashabi ones.

91
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,666
I like Khashabi ones. You know that.

92
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,958
Metwally, have you got the paper?
Go inside, like this.

93
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,125
What Khashabi?

94
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,583
Khashabi…

95
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:18,208
Metwally, I don't want you
to just write down the request.

96
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,625
I want you to take
an import and export number

97
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,750
when you're handing it to the officer.

98
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,125
Why, sir?

99
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:27,083
So that, God willing,
listen to me, Metwally…

100
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,503
- What's up?
- …when you hand it in, he won't say

101
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,503
- he didn't submit the request.
- What's up, Dad?

102
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,333
Hi, dear. How are you?

103
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,291
Not you, Metwally, you idiot.

104
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,708
- Take this.
- What's this, Dad?

105
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,250
The phone you said
couldn't be repaired. Turn around!

106
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,958
Turn around!

107
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,142
I don't want to hear the words
"Get me a phone" again!

108
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:46,875
Disgusting. What a disappointment.
It turns out I have sons, Mr. Metwally.

109
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:50,458
It's none of your business.
I can extend my service as I wish!

110
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:55,000
I tell you what, Metwally.
I have put up with you for 40 years.

111
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,125
Put up with me for once, and do as I say!

112
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:00,250
- Hussein!
- Dear God!

113
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,666
You came in with your shoes on?
I just mopped the apartment!

114
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,583
- I didn't realize.
- What do you mean?

115
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,166
What's the use of those glasses?

116
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,666
I clean, and you dirty it up?

117
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,291
God forgive you.
So, mine are glasses and yours are lasers?

118
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,846
You should write on the door,
"Don't enter until I finish cleaning"!

119
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,333
Grandpa!

120
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,583
Take it easy on the boy!

121
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,351
Take this!
He was annoying me on the stairs.

122
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,041
- "Give me the sweets!"
- Come, dear.

123
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,041
- Goodbye, Metwally.
- Have you lost weight?

124
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,041
- Dad, my dear.
- Yes?

125
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,583
I know that sweet look.

126
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:33,208
I want 50 dollars to get V-Bucks.

127
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,541
Is the "Alpha Box"
something they asked for at school?

128
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,500
- No, it's for the PlayStation.
- Seriously?

129
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:41,916
Don't speak that way!
God give me strength!

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,208
Boy, do you know that back in the day,
if I asked my father for 50 dollars,

131
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,791
he would have said I was a spy
and reported me!

132
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,395
- Get away from me!
- Come here, Boudy.

133
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,934
What does your dad have to do with us?

134
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:53,833
Are you just going to keep
harassing the boy?

135
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,875
You know what? Give it to him.
I'll deduct it from his allowance.

136
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,625
Now that's clever thinking!

137
00:08:58,708 --> 00:09:00,625
You son of a…

138
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,000
<i>Al Ahly club! How great they are!</i>

139
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,458
What are you doing?

140
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,875
- I'm watching the match.
- Match?

141
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,541
You left me to go watch the match?

142
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:25,625
We didn't utter a single word
to each other throughout dinner.

143
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:27,125
And at home you run to the TV?

144
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:30,208
My dear. Dinner was wonderful,
and the steak was amazing.

145
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,875
Would you prefer us to talk
and let the steak get cold?

146
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,809
We didn't talk during our last dinner,
the one before that or the previous one!

147
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,583
So it's a dinner problem.

148
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,750
We should sleep on an empty stomach
and not bother with dinner.

149
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,041
I'm not joking.

150
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,083
Why don't you talk to me?

151
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,833
- I have nothing to say, Sherine.
- Every day?

152
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:51,291
You have nothing to say,
Azaizy, every day?

153
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,583
Why didn't you talk?

154
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,500
Whenever I talk to you,
you give such ridiculous responses.

155
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:57,041
"Yeah… of course… mmm."

156
00:09:57,625 --> 00:09:58,791
All right.

157
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:02,625
From now on, I'll add words
so that you don't get bored or fed up.

158
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,458
Like, "No way!", "Really?", "Oops."

159
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,333
Stop being so cold and answer me properly!

160
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,708
Sherine, what do you want?

161
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,208
- I want a divorce.
- A divorce?

162
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,250
Don't, Sherine.

163
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,375
Don't keep bringing up that word.

164
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,166
It could really destroy us both.

165
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't want anything at all! I'm fed up!

166
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,166
What's this? Four girls, Shohdy?

167
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,375
I only went to the bathroom
for five minutes.

168
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,416
You underestimate the five minutes,
Oksana.

169
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,625
A minute away from you is like a year.

170
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,208
- Oh, really?
- Yes!

171
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,750
Come, come, don't be upset.

172
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,250
Come, have a seat.

173
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,875
Are you still upset?

174
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,583
All right, all right.

175
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:58,166
I will get my assistant in Soma Bay
to get the villa ready,

176
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,625
and we can go
and have a super wild weekend, okay?

177
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,333
And we can get married there.

178
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,750
Not that wild.

179
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,458
Oksana, just so you know,

180
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,541
no married people are happy.

181
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,708
Would you like it
if your dear Shohdy wasn't happy?

182
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,041
- No.
- Okay, then.

183
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,708
Marriage is a must.

184
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,125
Okay, we'll have this weekend,
and then marriage.

185
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,041
- Okay?
- No.

186
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:27,250
Because what's <i>halal</i> is nicer, I'll wait.

187
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:32,000
"Because what's <i>halal</i> is nicer,
I'll wait?"

188
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,958
Oksana, haven't I told you a hundred times
not to watch Radwa El Sherbiny?

189
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,625
You're still watching
Radwa El Sherbiny, right?

190
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,333
Here, drink this.

191
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:45,750
Actually, this won't do.
Wait, I'll get you something.

192
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:46,833
Wait.

193
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,708
Gino, give me something
that will stop me from seeing straight.

194
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,083
Both me and her.

195
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,958
"Because what's <i>halal</i> is nicer,
I'll wait."

196
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,750
What a traditional girl she's become.

197
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:02,041
I have a soft spot for black-and-white.

198
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,750
You see?

199
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,291
Gorgeous!

200
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,583
You've got me
going around in circles after you!

201
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,791
How did you find me?

202
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:12,916
Very easily.

203
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I've spent seven hours going around
all the lowlife places you could be at.

204
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,958
I've committed so many sins, Mr. Shohdy.

205
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,458
May God forgive you.

206
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,208
This paper needs to be signed.

207
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,916
Choose your timing, Mostafa. Tomorrow!

208
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,541
Tomorrow won't do.
Take it. Tomorrow won't do...

209
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:28,625
Get out of the way.

210
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,625
- Trust me, Mr. Shohdy.
- Hold this.

211
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,208
Mr. Kumar won't let
the tour group leave India

212
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,392
until we transfer the money.

213
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,041
That won't happen without a signature.

214
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:40,541
Mostafa, are you aware
of what you're talking about and where?

215
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,916
Tomorrow, Mostafa. Don't be a pain!

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,208
- Do you know her, Shohdy?
- "Her"?

217
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,208
She is one of my employees,
but she's completely dense.

218
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,541
Poor thing.

219
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,875
Please, mind your own business,
because this man has worn me out!

220
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,791
Mr. Shohdy,
I am not prepared to lose our staff

221
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,291
because you won't sign!

222
00:12:57,375 --> 00:13:01,000
- Besides, Mr. Kumar...
- Don't be a drag, Mostafa.

223
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,125
Work is for the workplace.

224
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,000
This is a place for dancing.

225
00:13:06,541 --> 00:13:08,125
- You want me to sign?
- Of course.

226
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,000
- Dance, then!
- What do you mean?

227
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,875
I won't sign unless you dance.

228
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,291
These are my work clothes.
My dancing clothes are at home.

229
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,541
Well, I've got it into my head

230
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,000
that I want you to dance
in your work clothes.

231
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,083
- If I dance, will you sign?
- I promise.

232
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,250
- Okay. Can I borrow her from you?
- Yes.

233
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:26,625
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

234
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,125
I will dance with you.

235
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,083
Take it easy. Take it easy.

236
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,541
<i>You are a master</i>

237
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,375
<i>Of style, suaveness and elegance</i>

238
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,208
<i>From an educated family</i>

239
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:47,791
This mango is nice, Uncle.

240
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,000
- But it's not from Ismailia.
- From Ismailia?

241
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,375
- No.
- Just eat it and shut up.

242
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,916
- Fine.
- Hussein?

243
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,833
How is Abeer, Adel's wife, doing now?

244
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
I really don't know.

245
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:02,000
I keep calling Adel. He doesn't pick up.
His phone is switched off.

246
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,541
Let me try him again.

247
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:07,000
Slurp it up.

248
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,291
Just keep it down
so I can call the man on the phone.

249
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:18,000
- Hello?
- Hussein.

250
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,250
Who calls someone at a time like this?

251
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,416
Sorry to bother you so early.

252
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,125
<i>You fool, it's the afternoon!</i>

253
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,291
Oh, really?

254
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,833
I have no idea what time it is,
or what day it is.

255
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,625
I don't even know where I am.

256
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:35,750
Tell me, is there any news on Adel?

257
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,583
Do you know why his phone is off?

258
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:41,083
Oh, really? Is it still switched off?

259
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,833
Wait a minute. Wait, wait.

260
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,416
<i>Azaizy is calling me.
I'll just take this call.</i>

261
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,833
Wait. Be patient. Calm down.

262
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,083
I don't need a headache from Azaizy
right now.

263
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,041
Be patient.

264
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,750
Here, genius, take it.
Make this phone call a…

265
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:58,416
- "Video contrast."
- You mean a "conference call," Dad.

266
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,958
I knew that. No need to show me up
in front of everyone.

267
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,708
Good morning. How are you, you idiot?

268
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:09,166
Hello, hello, hello, Sir Azaizy!

269
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,875
Come and join us for mangoes.

270
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,125
You're only inviting me because you know
I won't come, you imbecile.

271
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:16,125
Why don't you come? What's keeping you?

272
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:20,291
The last time we actually met up
was three months ago.

273
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:24,541
What do you mean, "three months"?
We met last Ramadan, you moron.

274
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,000
Last Ramadan was three months ago.

275
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,750
Now you know
who the moron is, you imbecile.

276
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:33,750
Hussein, why didn't you tell me
Shohdy was on the call so I could hang up?

277
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,166
Calm down, boatman,

278
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,875
or I'll come over and sort you out,
as usual.

279
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:41,250
Come over here, and you'll be leaving
with no pants, as always.

280
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:47,041
You always did like to see me
with no pants, you dirty thing.

281
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,291
You guys are hopeless. Tell me,

282
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:51,041
<i>is there any news on Adel?</i>

283
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:52,684
He hasn't been seen for about ten days.

284
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:56,833
Come on guys, let's show a little respect
and ask after the man's wife.

285
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,041
Come on, Shohdy!

286
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,934
This is the fifth time
I've told you we should marry,

287
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,875
and then I wake up in a hotel with you.

288
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:05,916
That won't do.

289
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,666
Put it on speaker and say
you're talking to your dad. I'll save you.

290
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:15,416
Let me go now, so I can help her forget
what she saw yesterday.

291
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,458
Give her two sleeping pills so she
forgets the fiasco she saw yesterday.

292
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,541
Go, you moron.

293
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,041
You sons of…

294
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:29,916
So you do know how to talk?

295
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,041
And you know how to laugh
with your friends.

296
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,208
I also know how to swim without arm bands.

297
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,916
And when I walk, I don't fall flat
on my face anymore. I've grown up.

298
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,458
And I learned how to talk, okay?

299
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,625
Very funny.

300
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,000
God help me.

301
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,791
- How are you, Abu Sid?
- Hi, Mr. Adel.

302
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,833
- I'm fine.
- Here is your gym membership.

303
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,250
If you let me in,
you'll be a world champion.

304
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,625
If you don't let me in,

305
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:04,500
I'll punch you so hard,
I'll send you flying!

306
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:05,791
Let me in.

307
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:09,916
Mr. Adel, we tried to contact you,
but your phone was switched off.

308
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,541
My condolences.

309
00:17:18,541 --> 00:17:21,041
This is the cycle of life.
We are all going to die.

310
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:39,666
The Lord opens the doors of heaven
before her.

311
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:46,000
So she returns to that land
where there is no death, only eternal joy.

312
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,041
So we may pray…

313
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:49,833
Where is Adel?

314
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,666
I couldn't see him outside.

315
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,500
Check it out, Captain Azouz has arrived.

316
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,583
What, you saw me and
couldn't hold back your laughter?

317
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,708
Let me in on the joke, you imbeciles.

318
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,250
What are you wearing?
Who comes to a funeral in that suit?

319
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:19,541
Get lost.

320
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,416
You are privileged to be able to sit
with Captain Azaizy, you imbecile.

321
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,708
Stop it, stop it.

322
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:26,711
Pull yourselves together.
People are watching us.

323
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,333
Respect yourself.
This is not the time for joking.

324
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:31,833
- Enough.
- This won't do.

325
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:32,916
Enough.

326
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,333
This suit has one of those
long sailor telescopes, right?

327
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,458
Pull it out and find Adel for us.

328
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:40,833
- And you're giving me grief?
- Enough, enough.

329
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,666
What's going on? Have you lost your minds?

330
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,375
The Lord is with you,
go in the safety of Jesus Christ.

331
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,916
Very nice fabric.

332
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,250
Thank you, guys.

333
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,250
May you be well.

334
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:56,333
May God bless her soul.

335
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:59,500
We wanted to be with you and Adel
at the burial.

336
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,583
But we only found out through Facebook.

337
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:02,750
So, where is Adel?

338
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,625
I am very worried about Adel.

339
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,458
He hasn't spoken to anyone
since the burial.

340
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,625
His face is hollow and different.

341
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:12,583
He even switched off his phone
and didn't come to the funeral today.

342
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:17,416
Oh, no. I will send him a message
on Facebook and see if he responds.

343
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,250
- There is no God but Allah.
- Mohammed is the messenger of Allah.

344
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,541
Honestly, I'm afraid
he will go into a depression.

345
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,125
I hope you'll stand by him these days.

346
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,291
May this be the end of the sadness,
God willing.

347
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:29,875
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:31,791
Because...

349
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:35,083
Of course, we have to stand by him.

350
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,750
Once again, I thank you.

351
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:42,583
May you be well.

352
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,875
Go ahead.

353
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:47,500
What are you laughing at
in front of the man?

354
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:50,875
One of his ladies
probably sent him a photo or a joke.

355
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,083
Shame on you.

356
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,041
Show me.

357
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:57,166
Show me with all your cleverness
what you're going to do about Adel.

358
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,791
Nothing.

359
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,041
We'll take him on a nice trip
for a couple of days

360
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:03,458
and entertain him at my villa in Soma Bay.

361
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,875
Who's coming with me?

362
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:06,375
I'll come with you, dude.

363
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,375
I was going for two days
with Sherine anyway.

364
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,208
But you know it will be a drag.

365
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,583
I'll go with you
and use Adel as an excuse.

366
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,458
First, find out how to convince Adel.
You think he'll go with you

367
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,142
when he didn't even attend
his wife's funeral?

368
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:19,333
This matter requires special tactics.

369
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:23,291
Leave this one to me.

370
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,500
Condolences, Adel.

371
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,375
Thank you.

372
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,750
Go ahead.

373
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,250
Be strong, Adel.

374
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,000
Be strong, brother.

375
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,291
May God give you strength.

376
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:51,208
Strength is for God.

377
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,416
What are you doing?

378
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,833
Why are you
all cooped up by yourself in here?

379
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:58,166
It's not good for you.
I know Abeer, may God bless her soul...

380
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,916
That's enough, Shohdy. I don't need this.

381
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,041
All right, look.
I want to ask you something.

382
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:08,125
What is it, Shohdy?

383
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,166
Even though the timing isn't right,

384
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,583
I want to ask you to come with us
for a couple of days.

385
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,708
- We can have a change of scenery...
- You're right. The timing isn't right.

386
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:19,875
Forgive me. I won't be able to come.

387
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:22,750
Adel, I'm not asking you, I'm begging you.

388
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:25,333
I'm begging you
to fulfill the last wish I have

389
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,041
before I die.

390
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,625
- What?
- Yes. You heard me right, Adel.

391
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:37,541
All the doctors have said
that my days are numbered.

392
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,750
And there aren't many left.

393
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,625
There aren't many left.

394
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,791
Yeah.

395
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:48,666
Not many...

396
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,333
Shohdy!

397
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,833
You won't die! You won't die!

398
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:56,541
And the doctors will turn out to be liars.

399
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,416
- Liars!
- That's enough, Hussein.

400
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,541
Don't do this to yourself.

401
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,625
- Tell me what you want to eat or drink.
- I want mango.

402
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,750
Mango?

403
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,875
Calm down. Calm down.

404
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,250
Don't do this to yourself.

405
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,500
- I can't, Shohdy.
- Calm down, Hussein.

406
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,791
Calm down.

407
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,291
- What do you think?
- Disgusting.

408
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:23,166
Disgusting?
The guy was about to give me an Oscar.

409
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,625
- He went to get me a mango for my acting.
- What Oscar? What mango?

410
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:27,833
Who asks for that?

411
00:22:27,916 --> 00:22:31,000
You might as well have asked him
to make fried eggs with pastrami!

412
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,916
Calm down, Hussein. Calm down.

413
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,416
Don't do this to yourself.

414
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:38,083
Thank God. Thank God.

415
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:40,750
I'm afraid
I couldn't find mangoes, Hussein.

416
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:43,125
- Are persimmons fine?
- Yeah, that will do.

417
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,250
Adel, please tell me that you agree
to come with us to Soma Bay?

418
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:54,416
You have to come, Adel.

419
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:01,000
That's enough, Hussein. That's enough.

420
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:03,125
Calm down, Hussein. Have some persimmon.

421
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,558
- Here, my dear.
- Thanks, mother-in-law.

422
00:23:08,625 --> 00:23:10,083
You're welcome.

423
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,500
- Mother-in-law.
- What?

424
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:15,666
I noticed that my father-in-law brought
two plates of prickly pear yesterday.

425
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,791
I would be grateful
if one of those plates came out now.

426
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:21,291
Have something savory first,
then have something sweet.

427
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,291
I can't keep up with your stomach, Son.

428
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,250
Mom, have you seen my swimsuit?

429
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:34,458
You're going to wear a swimsuit?
You'll look very weird.

430
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,333
Weird…

431
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,541
What swimsuit?
Are you going to Crazy Water?

432
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:41,541
Sorry, but...

433
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:44,875
What do you want a swimsuit for?
You always go swimming in your underwear.

434
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:47,166
I'm being serious.

435
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,291
Do you know how to swim, Uncle?
Should we get you Yousef's arm bands?

436
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:52,750
Are you done?

437
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:56,333
Are you done with your funny comedy act?

438
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,208
Or are there still more silly stories?

439
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:03,125
- Where is the swimsuit?
- All right.

440
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,500
Get out, get out, get out.

441
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,666
What's up?

442
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,458
What? What's up with you?

443
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:23,958
The company said you were traveling.
Tell me how!

444
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:25,916
- By car.
- By car?

445
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,916
What about the work that's piled up?

446
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,791
When will you take responsibility?
You have a company.

447
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:32,916
You have a company and staff
who are stressed out.

448
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,375
We're going through tough times,
and you're traveling!

449
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,458
Enough of this!

450
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,416
Why do you talk to me like this?
Are you dumb?

451
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,666
You're right, Mr. Shohdy. I'm sorry.

452
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,875
I'm afraid for the company.

453
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:44,416
If you leave without signing
the contracts, the company...

454
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,601
Give me the contracts.
I'll sign them and be done with it.

455
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:49,041
- All right.
- Give them to me.

456
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:54,250
If I didn't know
that you did all the work in the company,

457
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:56,375
I'd have fired you ages ago
and had some peace.

458
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:58,041
You're nothing without me.

459
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,375
What did you say?

460
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:03,958
- What did you say?
- I said without me, you are...

461
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:05,958
Thank you! Thank you! What is this?

462
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:09,625
This beautiful signature was the issue?
This tiny squiggle was the issue?

463
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:10,916
Thank you. Thank you.

464
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,416
Where's the invite to?

465
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,809
I'm going to show my friend a good time
for a couple of days.

466
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:15,833
Adel. You know him.

467
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:17,791
Yeah. What's wrong with Mr. Adel?

468
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,000
- His wife.
- She is a grumpy old woman.

469
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,958
She's always bringing him down.

470
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,750
- She died.
- So that she could bring him down!

471
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:28,250
See how they think?
They'll do anything to bring us down!

472
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,625
"I'll die, but at least
I'll bring him down!" God help us!

473
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,708
You're dumb, right?
You're dumb, not normal.

474
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:35,166
His wife passed away.
May God bless her soul.

475
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,375
Sorry. May God bless her soul.

476
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:40,666
By the way,
I'm trying to get ahold of Mahi,

477
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,541
who looks after the Soma Bay office.

478
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,101
I want her to prepare the villa for me.

479
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,458
I call her, and her phone's turned off.
How I can get ahold of her?

480
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:49,458
Don't worry. I'll come with you.

481
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:51,341
- Why would you travel with me?
- To find her.

482
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,041
Can't you do that here?

483
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:55,541
I can, but look at this coincidence!
What a coincidence!

484
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,958
- What?
- I was going to the bus station right now

485
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,625
to catch any bus going to Soma Bay.

486
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,250
- Really?
- I swear, God forgive me.

487
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:03,500
- No way.
- I swear!

488
00:26:03,583 --> 00:26:05,666
You want me to come with you?
You want to go with me?

489
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,875
As you wish. You choose.

490
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:09,500
You're being ridiculous.
I've figured you out.

491
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:12,208
You want to come with me for a free trip.
I got you.

492
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:14,833
I do want to come for a free trip.
Forgive me, Mr. Shohdy,

493
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:16,000
I want to see the sea.

494
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:18,791
I haven't taken a day off
since I was promoted a year ago.

495
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:22,208
I need to be close by. If I need advice,
or a signature, I know where to find you.

496
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:26,125
It won't work out.
In order to convince Adel to come with me,

497
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:29,166
I had to tell him I was ill
and in my final days.

498
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:34,041
It won't look good if I'm thinking
about work during my final days.

499
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,833
We can tell him anything.
Just take me with you!

500
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:38,583
Please, take me with you!

501
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:43,750
Are the contents fragile?

502
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:46,267
Do you have any electronics, blenders?
Any china, cashew nuts?

503
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:47,291
Cashew nuts?

504
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:50,958
- Who is this funny comedian, Shohdy?
- Mostafa. He's with me.

505
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:52,625
- Thank you.
- I'm his son, by the way.

506
00:26:52,708 --> 00:26:53,791
Welcome.

507
00:26:56,416 --> 00:26:57,750
My heart is with you, my dear.

508
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:00,041
My dear Azaizy.

509
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:01,958
It's okay. That's how it is.

510
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:05,583
The precious ones leave,
and only the disgusting ones remain.

511
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,750
- May God honor you, Azaizy.
- No, Adool, honestly.

512
00:27:09,625 --> 00:27:10,708
It's all right.

513
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:13,791
The good people leave us very early,
in the morning.

514
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:15,916
When did she die?

515
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:20,125
My dear, take this.

516
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:22,208
- You. Come.
- Me?

517
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:23,500
Yes.

518
00:27:24,041 --> 00:27:26,041
- Yes?
- Put this in the trunk.

519
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:29,000
- Why don't you put it?
- What is this rudeness?

520
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,541
Why don't you choose proper drivers?

521
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:33,000
He looks like a driver,
but he's an employee of mine.

522
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,875
Employee? I'm the office manager,
Mr. Shohdy!

523
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:38,333
An office manager? So what? What did you
manage before that, a chest of drawers?

524
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:43,041
What drawer are you sitting in
at the office, in case we need you?

525
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:46,309
Am I supposed to answer?
What is this silliness, Mr. Shohdy?

526
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,916
Enough, Mostafa.
He's your dad's age.

527
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,541
My father is much cooler than him.

528
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:52,875
- Boy!
- Take the bag and get into the drawer.

529
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:54,833
- What drawer?
- Get into the car.

530
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:56,458
Wait, son.

531
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,741
- Take this.
- Stop! Why are you getting on my case too?

532
00:27:58,791 --> 00:27:59,916
Why don't you give him 20?

533
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,958
- Should I give him another five?
- Come on, guys. Let's get going.

534
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:04,666
Where are you going?

535
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,666
- Give me the keys. I'm going to drive.
- Why?

536
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,750
Because you drive so slowly,
we won't arrive until after tomorrow.

537
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:11,708
Azouz, go sit in the back.

538
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,392
What do you mean
"sit in the back," Shohdy?

539
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:15,142
Me and Adel are in the back.
Sit him beside you.

540
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:18,083
- What about me, sir?
- I'm not sitting in the front or the back.

541
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:20,250
I'm driving,
and you're sitting next to me, Hussein.

542
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:23,291
Where will I sit? I'm not here
to see you off. I'm going with you.

543
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:24,916
Your father...

544
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,809
Don't mention him,
or I'll bring up your mother!

545
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:29,625
- I'm not sitting on his lap.
- I will drive!

546
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,041
We don't want to bother you, Adel.

547
00:28:32,125 --> 00:28:35,208
Shohdy, I will drive.
Let's just stop these childish antics.

548
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:37,333
No, Adel, Shohdy is right.

549
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,583
You might crash the car
while daydreaming about Abeer.

550
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,750
Give me the keys, Shohdy!

551
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:44,416
Come on, come on.

552
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,333
What are you doing?

553
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:49,166
- I'm sitting in the front.
- Why? I'm sitting in the front.

554
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,434
I don't know how to sit in back.
I have to sit in front.

555
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:53,583
Go and sit in the back
like I told you.

556
00:28:53,666 --> 00:28:56,541
- No, I'm sitting in the front.
- Fine, sit in the front.

557
00:28:56,625 --> 00:28:58,416
We're not little kids, Azaizy.

558
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,125
- Azaizy, I want you. Come here.
- What?

559
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:01,708
I want you, but away from Adel.

560
00:29:01,791 --> 00:29:03,791
Away from Adel. Let me tell you something.

561
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:09,625
What a strong move, Shohdy.

562
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:10,916
Get in.

563
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,625
- Petty children.
- They are truly petty.

564
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,625
Because they want to sit
in the front, right?

565
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:18,125
You've left your drawer.
Where are you going?

566
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:22,875
What's going on? Wait, wait...

567
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:25,291
Guys, wait a minute.
Mr. Shohdy, where am I gonna sit?

568
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:28,458
Mr. Shohdy, I'm coming with you!

569
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,375
What is this song you're listening to?

570
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:45,375
This, Mostafa, is our song.
A song from our generation.

571
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:49,291
It was all the rage back then.

572
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:51,083
So, this was a trend back then?

573
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:53,416
"Was a trend"? It is still a trend.

574
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
Still?

575
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:57,750
Mostafa, get me some water
from the icebox.

576
00:29:57,833 --> 00:29:59,250
Sure, Mr. Shohdy.

577
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:03,041
Mostafa, check if there's
a Diet Coke in the icebox.

578
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,291
Who's the Diet Coke for?

579
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:06,875
Who do you think, my mother?
It's for me, of course.

580
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:09,458
How is it for you?
You decided to go on a diet today?

581
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,250
Or did your doctor say, "Eat
whatever you want, but have Diet Coke"?

582
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:14,291
What do you mean,
"Eat whatever you want"? Rude.

583
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:16,166
- Mostafa.
- What, Hajj?

584
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,708
Make me a cup of tea, please.

585
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:20,416
You'll find a packet
with some tea and sugar there.

586
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,059
Cut from the edge, as there's no spoon,
and pour it out like this.

587
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:24,883
Why are you so obsessed with me,
Hajj Hussein?

588
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:26,851
How can I make tea
when I'm squashed up like this?

589
00:30:26,875 --> 00:30:29,666
You have so much space in front of you,
you could have a tea party!

590
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,351
Do you think it's normal
to raise your voice?

591
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:35,291
Quiet down. I'm trying to send a message
to Mahi. Her phone is switched off.

592
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,458
Where's the water, Mostafa?

593
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:40,291
All right, Mr. Shohdy. I'm alone
in the kitchen and no one's helping!

594
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:44,791
Ah, Sabah's mother, every man's dream.

595
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:49,666
Sorry for the question, guys.

596
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,791
Did you make a hole in the wall
to look at the maid?

597
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,000
Yes.

598
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,833
We were children, Mostafa.
Twenty to 21 years old.

599
00:30:57,916 --> 00:31:01,708
- How were you children at the age of 21?
- In our days, a 21-year-old was a child.

600
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:07,250
The most hijinks
came from this man driving the car.

601
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:11,166
He used to get up at the crack of dawn
and go sleep at Mr. Shohdy's house.

602
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,583
He would peep through the window,
and he had...

603
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:17,083
- The binoculars...
- That belonged to your dad!

604
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,250
And he was the smart one!

605
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:23,750
Do you remember, Adel?

606
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,625
I can't take it…

607
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:28,500
Adel?

608
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:31,708
Sorry, guys. I wasn't paying attention.

609
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:38,833
Why don't you put something on,
like the radio? It's a long trip.

610
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:40,083
Sure.

611
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:45,083
<i>What does it mean?</i>

612
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:51,625
<i>It means I won't see you again, that's it</i>

613
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:58,583
<i>I won't touch you, I won't tell you
About anything that's bothering me</i>

614
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:01,750
<i>What does it mean?</i>

615
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:04,833
Leave it. It's nice!

616
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:11,875
<i>He left me and went away</i>

617
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:15,083
<i>All the pain</i>

618
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:19,416
<i>He left me, I got ill
And then I was at peace</i>

619
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,666
<i>At peace</i>

620
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:29,333
<i>Why did you leave me?
Why did you leave me?</i>

621
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:32,125
<i>Why did you leave me?</i>

622
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:34,041
<i>Why did you leave me?</i>

623
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:40,000
It looks like it's going to be
a wonderful trip.

624
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,875
I honestly don't know what to do.

625
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:57,291
Beware of the direction of the wind
so there's no splash back.

626
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:02,916
You've grown up, Shohdy,
and you're urinating like a man now.

627
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm the one who's surprised.
How are you urinating standing up, Hana?

628
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:11,458
Pull yourself together, Shohdy,
before I come over there and slap you.

629
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:13,958
Are you embarrassed by your name?

630
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:16,958
Adel, please stop talking about
this subject.

631
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:18,916
Sorry, guys,
but I've always had the problem

632
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,958
of not understanding
my dad's friends' jokes.

633
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,291
Is your name Azaizy or Hana?

634
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:25,375
His name is Mr. Hana Al Azaizy.

635
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:27,416
And his wife's name is Sherine.

636
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,500
So, it's Hana and Sherine.

637
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:30,875
Shohdy.

638
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:34,583
I swear, if you don't wrap up
this subject, I'll go back.

639
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:37,625
I don't know why you're uptight.
The man is explaining it to him, Hana.

640
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:38,750
I mean, Azaizy.

641
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,125
Even you are mocking me, Adel?

642
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:44,791
You should be depressed right now
given the terminal stage you're in.

643
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,458
- Are you an idiot?
- You're the reason!

644
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:47,583
Enough!

645
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:50,541
Don't be upset.

646
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:52,958
The name Hana
is a very beautiful and popular name.

647
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:54,083
Thank you, sir.

648
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,000
The first girl I dated
was also named Hana.

649
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:57,375
But she was a little shorter.

650
00:33:58,708 --> 00:33:59,875
Do you like that?

651
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:02,041
You let a worthless child mock me?

652
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,750
Why say that, Ms... I mean, Mr. Hana?

653
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,416
That's enough, that's enough.

654
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,000
Mostafa, let's go. Come on.

655
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:14,041
Hussein, come on.
Where are you getting all this water from?

656
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:17,875
Hussein, are you urinating or showering?

657
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,416
I can see lots of shower gel.

658
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,750
- Zizo.
- Get in, get in.

659
00:34:28,708 --> 00:34:30,458
This won't do. Wait.

660
00:34:30,541 --> 00:34:32,041
Son!

661
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:33,666
Son, this won't do!

662
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,375
- How are you, Yasser?
- I'm your valet, Essam.

663
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:11,583
Oh, yeah, Essam.

664
00:35:11,666 --> 00:35:14,291
- Essam, where is Mahi?
- I don't know, sir.

665
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:17,125
Get the bags out
and fill the car up with gas.

666
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:18,916
Me, me, Mr. Shohdy!

667
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,208
And get Mostafa down with the bags, Essam.

668
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,416
Go ahead, go ahead.

669
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,833
Of course, you'll find it's dusty

670
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:30,125
as I haven't been here for ages,
like I told you.

671
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,041
It must be dusty, then.

672
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:37,000
But this won't stop us
from having an awesome weekend!

673
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:39,958
What's this?

674
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,434
Shohdy, didn't you tell me
that your mother died?

675
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:48,098
- Yeah.
- Is that her, God bless her soul?

676
00:35:48,458 --> 00:35:50,166
No, that isn't her, God bless her soul.

677
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:53,291
Are you sure of the address?
This might not be your villa.

678
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:54,791
What do you mean, you imbecile?

679
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:58,166
- I just unlocked the door in front of you.
- Maybe it's not your key.

680
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,083
- Then whose key is it?
- The villa's key.

681
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,458
- Nice one.
- Zizo, don't annoy me! What's going on?

682
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,291
What's this?

683
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,750
Oh, my goodness!

684
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:12,333
- Oh, my goodness! Who are they?
- What's going on, Shohdy?

685
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,666
Did you get a communal villa?

686
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:15,934
What do you mean "communal"?
I don't know what's going on.

687
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:17,750
What are these people doing in the water?

688
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:19,791
- Yasser?
- It's Essam, Mr. Shohdy.

689
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:21,541
Oh, my goodness! What is this?

690
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:25,375
- And why are they sleeping on the floor?
- I don't know.

691
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:27,125
What's going on, guys?

692
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:35,458
Good morning. Welcome to Masoud Center,
"Unlimited Containment."

693
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:37,458
We have fully comprehensive care.

694
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:41,625
We also have elderly care
given by the best doctors

695
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:43,000
for geriatric diseases,

696
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:47,541
such as joint stiffness, Alzheimer's,
Parkinson's, incontinence.

697
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:51,041
- The robes are for the women.
- The robes?

698
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,666
- We also have a massage that ends with…
- Stop. Be quiet.

699
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,208
- Where's Mahi?
- Mahi?

700
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:58,041
You know the owner, Mahi?

701
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,666
She's not here, sir.

702
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,375
Are you Mr. Masoud, her father?

703
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:04,791
No, he's Mr. Shohdy, her aunt.

704
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,458
Zizo, this isn't the time for it.
Where is she?

705
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:09,708
She's at the marina.

706
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,958
Do you know the Shohdy Tourism Office?

707
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:13,916
- I do.
- Well, she closed it

708
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,833
and turned it into the Masoud Yoga Center.

709
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:17,541
She is in so much trouble!

710
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:20,166
- I'm going to destroy her life!
- Then I'm coming with you.

711
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,291
Adel's glass.

712
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:26,333
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

713
00:37:26,416 --> 00:37:27,875
Welcome, sir.

714
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:30,291
You were saying the massage ended with…

715
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,458
Then Shohdy cut you off.
What does it end with?

716
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:36,708
Sauna and jacuzzi.
What did you think it was? I don't get it.

717
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:39,875
I understood jacuzzi and sauna,
the other way around.

718
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:41,642
- Isn't that right, Hussein?
- Of course, Zizo.

719
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:43,500
We are always looking for happy endings.

720
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:45,416
Here, take this drink.

721
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:47,916
Oh, my goodness! What is this?

722
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,250
Wait, Shohdy. You're gonna die too soon.

723
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,125
This is unbelievable! Where is the car?

724
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:54,458
- Yasser.
- His name is Essam.

725
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,750
Essam! Where is the car?

726
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:59,250
- Didn't you tell him to go and fill it up?
- Oh, yeah.

727
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,625
- Hey, you, come here.
- Yes, sir.

728
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:04,125
- Drop us off.
- But this isn't to your standard, sir.

729
00:38:04,208 --> 00:38:06,125
What does that have to do with you?
Drop us off!

730
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:08,250
Shohdy, it would be better
if we wait for the car.

731
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:10,625
I can't, Adel.
Something is gonna happen to me.

732
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:14,041
- That was a really bad move.
- Take it easy, take it easy.

733
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,583
- Why won't you go?
- Go where, sir?

734
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:17,000
- Take us.
- Take you where?

735
00:38:17,083 --> 00:38:18,750
Shohdy Tourism Office, do you know it?

736
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:20,500
You mean the Masoud Yoga Center?

737
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:22,833
- Has it become that popular?
- Very!

738
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:25,500
- She is a despicable woman, Adel.
- It's all right...

739
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:27,375
Something is gonna happen to me.
Let's go!

740
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:29,083
It's better if we wait for the car.

741
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:30,833
What's wrong, sir?

742
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:34,101
- Where are you taking the guys?
- What's wrong with taking my kids out?

743
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,805
Didn't he say
it was none of your business?

744
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:37,166
You're right. Sorry.

745
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:41,208
It's better if we wait for the car,
Shohdy!

746
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:53,458
One more time, we'll take a deep
breath together with our arms raised…

747
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,333
And the other side…

748
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:00,625
Mahi!

749
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:04,958
I need you here.

750
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:08,958
I'm sure...

751
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:11,916
I need you here,
or I'll ridicule you in front of everyone.

752
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:17,875
Okay. Carry on, please.

753
00:39:17,958 --> 00:39:20,750
Do what we just did one more time.

754
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:26,333
Good morning.

755
00:39:26,416 --> 00:39:29,000
- How are you, Mr. Shohdy?
- How am I?

756
00:39:29,083 --> 00:39:31,041
I'll lock you up for what you've done.

757
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,458
Why, Mr. Shohdy?

758
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,791
What did I do? You'll lock me up
because I got your business booming?

759
00:39:35,875 --> 00:39:38,625
My business?
Then what's this "Masoud Yoga"?

760
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:41,250
That's just a slight renovation.

761
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:44,208
Because I felt
that the name was more creative.

762
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:47,416
- And the villa?
- You went to the villa?

763
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,750
You mean the old people's home.

764
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:51,416
No, Mr. Shohdy,
it's not an old people's home.

765
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,875
It's a healing center.

766
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,583
- Oh!
- And, by the way,

767
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:56,708
your office is exactly as you left it.

768
00:39:56,791 --> 00:39:57,791
It hasn't been touched.

769
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:00,833
I just used the rest of the space.

770
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:05,000
Thank you! Thank you very much
for leaving my office closed.

771
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,875
Calm down, calm down, Shohdy.

772
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:09,375
I am trying to help you.

773
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:11,351
I've been trying to calm him down
the whole journey.

774
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,666
And your responses are really infuriating.

775
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:17,250
Look, right now,
get those people out of the villa!

776
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:18,416
Right away. Today!

777
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,083
I can't do that, Mr. Shohdy.

778
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:24,750
They came through a tourism company.
If I kick them out, they'll lock me up.

779
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:27,791
And if you don't get them out,
I will lock you up!

780
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:30,083
Mahi didn't do anything wrong, Mr. Shohdy.

781
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:32,208
I mean that Mahi did what you taught us.

782
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,166
I taught you to scam people?

783
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,750
No. You taught us
to think outside of the box.

784
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,416
You taught us to not stop working.

785
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,166
You taught us that when tourism is slow,
we shouldn't take it easy.

786
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,250
Exactly! Exactly!

787
00:40:42,333 --> 00:40:43,583
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

788
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:46,500
- What else did he teach us? I forgot.
- He taught us... He taught us...

789
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:48,416
He taught us to forgive.

790
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,625
And to forget yesterday.

791
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:52,500
And to think more about the days ahead.

792
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,541
Forgive me, Mr. Shohdy, forgive me.

793
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:56,166
- For my sake.
- Come on, Shohdy.

794
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,601
And, Mr. Shohdy, don't forget
that Mahi was the most beautiful...

795
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:00,208
I mean, smartest one in the company.

796
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,166
I used to tell the staff,
"Mahi is the smartest one of us all."

797
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,208
You sent her here
to get the business going.

798
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:07,091
And there!
She got the business going for you!

799
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:09,583
It's okay, Shohdy. Don't worry yourself.

800
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:12,958
It's only a matter of days,
then you'll be bidding the world farewell.

801
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:16,333
You won't be sad over a villa.

802
00:41:16,416 --> 00:41:19,416
You're completely right, Sheikh.
I forgot about that issue.

803
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:21,791
Look.

804
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:26,208
If I didn't have guests with me,
I would have made a lot of trouble.

805
00:41:26,791 --> 00:41:28,333
Please, finish what you're doing.

806
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:31,500
Then come and see me
so I can tell you off in peace!

807
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,625
Maybe.

808
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:40,208
What were you saying?

809
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Is Shohdy dying?

810
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,375
You know what, Doola?

811
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:47,333
The girl has gotten really pretty.
She wasn't like that at all.

812
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:50,125
I guess being by the sea and doing yoga

813
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:53,083
do very nice things for your figure.

814
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:54,333
That's all you're good at.

815
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:56,000
Let's see what we're going to ride.

816
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,333
Come, son, come.

817
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:01,333
- What's going on? It's you again?
- Your servant, Hudhud, from Asyut.

818
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:04,208
Weren't you on the tricycle a minute ago?

819
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:07,250
When I finish my shift at the supermarket,
I do safari trips.

820
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:08,458
You want to come with me?

821
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:10,041
- Go, go.
- Where?

822
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:11,833
- Take us.
- Where to?

823
00:42:11,916 --> 00:42:13,500
Where we came from!

824
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:15,208
Why didn't you call me?

825
00:42:15,791 --> 00:42:18,151
Give me the chance
to put things in order before he arrived?

826
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,083
- You weren't exactly answering my calls.
- Mostafa, are you still...

827
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:23,166
The past is over!

828
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,958
Not the past, I'm talking about today.
I called many times. Your phone was off.

829
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:31,000
My phone is broken,
and I will pick it up tonight.

830
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,958
Just my luck.

831
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:34,875
What brought you here?

832
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:36,791
What brought me here?

833
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:40,208
Coincidence. I went to get some papers
from him in Cairo, and he said,

834
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:42,351
"Mostafa, you're a good guy.
Come with me to Soma Bay."

835
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:44,726
I told him, "I can't. I have work."
He said, "You have to be with me

836
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,458
by my side for everything that happens."

837
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:48,041
I said, "All right, I'll come, then."

838
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:50,916
Wow, looks like you've really progressed.

839
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,208
You've also really rounded out...

840
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:57,666
I mean, really progressed.
I mean, the yoga and this Masoud Bay.

841
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:02,000
Anyway, I need to get back to my class.

842
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:04,125
So, see you later.

843
00:43:04,208 --> 00:43:06,142
All right, I'll wait for you
in the villa tonight.

844
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:08,916
When you come for Shohdy
to tell you off, like you agreed.

845
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:11,000
Didn't you agree…

846
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:13,458
- Bye, Mostafa.
- Bye.

847
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:22,416
- One second.
- One second, one second.

848
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,666
Is there something wrong?

849
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,416
Of course, I wasn't expecting us
to all be sleeping together in one room.

850
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,916
And especially not in this room.

851
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,666
So, right from the start, let's be nice.
I don't want any teasing.

852
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,392
Teasing?
Rats are nothing to be ashamed of.

853
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:38,750
Exactly. You're a lifelong friend.

854
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:42,625
There's enough space for everyone.
Go in. Don't worry, go in.

855
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:47,125
Shohdy, I don't want you to get worked up.
You're a sick man who's dying.

856
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,583
An office is an office.
Isn't there a sofa?

857
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:52,833
- It's an office. Of course there's a sofa.
- Okay then.

858
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:55,791
- Come on!
- Please, come in.

859
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,541
Come in.

860
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:16,458
What are these disgusting things, Shohdy?

861
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:20,291
- Are you a sadist?
- I knew the teasing would begin.

862
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:24,166
Go ahead.
Did you want to say something too? Say it.

863
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:26,541
No, I promised you I wouldn't tease you.

864
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:28,041
I'll just laugh.

865
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:32,833
- Shohda.
- Yes?

866
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:34,625
Do you enjoy being tied up?

867
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:37,416
It's not me that gets tied up, Hussein.

868
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,875
- Then who?
- Nobody gets tied up, Hussein.

869
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:42,458
It's just decoration,
a vibe, atmosphere, ambience.

870
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:43,916
Ambience!

871
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:48,916
Shohdy, is this also "ambience"?

872
00:44:50,541 --> 00:44:53,291
No, Azaizy, they hold on to that
for the road bumps.

873
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,750
Like on the metro.

874
00:44:56,708 --> 00:44:58,083
Forgive me, brother Adel.

875
00:44:58,666 --> 00:45:00,583
The last time I saw something like this

876
00:45:00,666 --> 00:45:03,791
was in those German films
that guy would translate for us, remember?

877
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:06,375
The "Oh, yeah" ones.

878
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:10,083
That's all you can manage? "Oh, yeah."

879
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,583
German films. Get off that pole!

880
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:14,791
- Fine.
- You know how much that pole costs?

881
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:18,458
That's enough about the poles, Shohdy.
We want to see how we're going to sleep.

882
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:20,916
I'll tell you how.

883
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,125
This chair turns into a sofa.

884
00:45:23,208 --> 00:45:26,291
Very nice! This chair is mine.

885
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:29,833
Sorry, Adel.
I'm not used to sleeping next to anyone.

886
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:34,208
You guys can tumble around on there
and sleep as you please.

887
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:35,916
But this chair is for me.

888
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,125
Oh, yeah, Shohdy.
I had one like this at home.

889
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:42,833
It had a nail so that it wouldn't close.

890
00:45:43,625 --> 00:45:46,625
Yeah, you're right.
It has a nail so it doesn't close.

891
00:45:46,708 --> 00:45:48,375
- Where is it?
- Look for it.

892
00:45:48,458 --> 00:45:50,083
- Where's the nail?
- Look for it.

893
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:52,541
Hello. What's this?

894
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:55,000
God forgive me.

895
00:45:55,083 --> 00:45:58,083
What is this room, Mr. Shohdy?
Is she looking at hell?

896
00:45:58,166 --> 00:45:59,583
Mostafa, I swear to God,

897
00:45:59,666 --> 00:46:03,416
if anybody at work finds out
about this room, especially that pole,

898
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,541
I won't fire you, I will lock you up.

899
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:08,083
- Understood?
- Don't worry, Mr. Shohdy. Don't worry.

900
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:10,927
What exactly do you do in here?
Are you filming "50 Shades of Shohdy"?

901
00:46:14,416 --> 00:46:17,791
Guys, where are we going to sleep?
I'm dozing off.

902
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:21,000
- I'm going to sleep on that sofa.
- That sofa is mine.

903
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:23,392
It's obvious you haven't taken me
into account for the sleeping.

904
00:46:23,416 --> 00:46:26,166
Fine. I'll take this cover
and go find somewhere downstairs.

905
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,458
Boy!

906
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:29,875
- Come here!
- What's wrong?

907
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:31,666
- Come here!
- That's rude.

908
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:35,291
Are you old enough to joke around with me?

909
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I'm sorry.

910
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:38,583
Put the cover back.

911
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:40,833
So rude.

912
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:45,916
If you ask, you can have anything.

913
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,458
- Okay, can I ask if I can take the cover?
- No.

914
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,708
Azaizy.

915
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:10,083
Azaizy.

916
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:13,333
Straighten out your head
so you can sleep properly.

917
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:16,833
The nail, Shohdy.

918
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:19,833
The nail for the bed, Shohdy.

919
00:47:19,916 --> 00:47:21,125
- You want the nail?
- Yeah.

920
00:47:21,958 --> 00:47:23,791
Give me your hand. I'll give you the nail.

921
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:27,791
My back, Adel. My back.

922
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:30,416
Give me your other hand
so I can give you the other nail.

923
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:32,434
- Here's the other nail.
- Thank you.

924
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:35,041
- Put the two nails next to each other.
- Is that the nail?

925
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:36,583
Yes, sleep, my dear.

926
00:47:36,666 --> 00:47:37,916
Thank you, Adel.

927
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:40,416
Nail... Thank you, Adel.

928
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,041
Where should I sleep?

929
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:57,333
What's this?

930
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:00,666
Say a prayer, Hajj!

931
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,750
What are you doing?

932
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:06,041
You! Have I become
an old person's punching bag?

933
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:13,750
Hi. How are you?

934
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:19,541
What is he doing?

935
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:22,416
Thank you.

936
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,708
Goodbye.

937
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:28,750
Mostafa?

938
00:48:29,541 --> 00:48:31,250
- Mostafa.
- Mahi.

939
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:33,416
- Sorry. I didn't see you.
- Hi.

940
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:34,791
- How are you?
- Fine.

941
00:48:34,875 --> 00:48:35,916
Have a seat.

942
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,000
What, has Shohdy gone to sleep?

943
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:42,583
They've all gone to sleep.

944
00:48:43,416 --> 00:48:44,666
Are you still upset?

945
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:47,083
I was upset until I saw you.

946
00:48:47,666 --> 00:48:49,458
What? I'm talking about Shohdy.

947
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:52,371
Yeah, Shohdy's still upset.

948
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:55,166
You've been exposed!

949
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:59,166
Don't worry. Come over in the morning,
tell him a few words. He'll let it go.

950
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:00,875
Yeah, I'll do that.

951
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:05,916
To be honest, I wanted to thank you
for what you said this morning.

952
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:08,958
You're worth it.

953
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:11,458
No, really, you're a great guy.

954
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:13,208
Not that word, please.

955
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:16,666
The last time you used that word,
you later accepted an offer to come here.

956
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,559
You said, "Sorry, Mostafa.
I want to build my future first."

957
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:20,916
And I haven't seen you since.

958
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,750
- You still remember?
- Remember?

959
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,166
I can't really remember.

960
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,791
That was around four years ago?

961
00:49:29,916 --> 00:49:31,875
- No, it was last year.
- What?

962
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:33,833
Oh, yeah. You're right.

963
00:49:33,916 --> 00:49:35,916
I was then promoted
to Shohdy's right-hand man.

964
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It was last year, indeed.

965
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:45,041
You came for Shohdy, right?
Go home and come back tomorrow.

966
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:47,750
What is this apathy, son?

967
00:49:51,666 --> 00:49:52,875
Yeah.

968
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:55,166
Okay.

969
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:02,458
- Can I ask you something before I go?
- Ask.

970
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:07,125
Did you really come here by chance
because you can't leave Shohdy?

971
00:50:07,208 --> 00:50:08,291
Or…

972
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:11,291
What would I leave work and come here for?

973
00:50:16,916 --> 00:50:18,375
Okay, bye.

974
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:19,708
Bye.

975
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:21,750
Because you're an idiot.

976
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:23,541
Idiot, idiot.

977
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:25,583
And what's this?

978
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,958
What? Have you not slept yet?

979
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:38,666
- Who can sleep with these mosquitoes?
- Yeah.

980
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:42,833
You could have gone for a walk with
what's-her-name who was just with you.

981
00:50:42,916 --> 00:50:45,416
What? Could you see me?

982
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:48,958
Yeah. To be honest, I could hear you.

983
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:51,041
Did you hear everything?

984
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,416
- You're rude.
- Very.

985
00:50:55,375 --> 00:50:57,541
You were a complete Goliath.

986
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:58,958
- Mr. Adel.
- I swear.

987
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,833
Didn't you come for her?

988
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:04,101
Why are you pushing her away?

989
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:06,250
Because she's getting on my nerves,
Mr. Adel!

990
00:51:06,333 --> 00:51:08,934
She knows I want her, that I came for her.
She's playing games with me.

991
00:51:08,958 --> 00:51:10,976
You saw and heard everything.
I'm trying to get her.

992
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,750
Get her? You're an idiot!

993
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:14,625
- I'm leaving.
- Sit down, boy!

994
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:18,208
They are all like that, Mostafa.

995
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:21,000
They want someone
who makes them feel loved.

996
00:51:21,875 --> 00:51:23,000
Who can't live without them.

997
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:24,791
Yes.

998
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:27,791
If she agrees to be with me,
I'll make her feel that way all the time.

999
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:29,416
Why aren't you with her?

1000
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,875
Because her hair goes reddish brown
in the sun.

1001
00:51:31,958 --> 00:51:33,625
What's wrong, Mr. Adel? Pay attention!

1002
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:35,548
She's not with me
because I'm not her priority.

1003
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:36,708
She doesn't see me at all.

1004
00:51:36,791 --> 00:51:39,500
She's put me in her Plan B,
after her work and her future.

1005
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:42,083
- I'm C.
- You're actually an F.

1006
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:45,166
- "F"?
- Yes. It's your fault, Mostafa.

1007
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,458
You're the one
who has to show yourself to her.

1008
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:50,916
If she doesn't mind, in principle,

1009
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:54,291
then you keep trying again and again.

1010
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:55,875
You won't lose anything, silly.

1011
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:59,208
You're right. I won't lose anything.

1012
00:51:59,291 --> 00:52:02,500
Right. Go rest inside
because of the mosquitoes.

1013
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:04,250
Tell me everything. I'm by your side.

1014
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,958
- Can I sleep in your spot?
- Upstairs? No, are you crazy?

1015
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:11,708
Upstairs is for adults only.
Find a sofa downstairs to pass out on.

1016
00:52:11,791 --> 00:52:12,875
Sofa?

1017
00:52:13,416 --> 00:52:15,250
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1018
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,583
What's this?

1019
00:52:20,208 --> 00:52:21,375
Have you not jumped yet?

1020
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:24,125
What patience…

1021
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:34,375
You have the right…

1022
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:41,083
Can I know what jerk did this to me?

1023
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:44,291
What kind of prank is that, Shohdy?

1024
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:46,208
Shohdy? It has nothing to do with me.

1025
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:48,750
He probably walks in his sleep
and does strange things.

1026
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:52,833
Stop joking around and uncuff me.
I want to go to the bathroom.

1027
00:52:52,916 --> 00:52:55,625
Why don't you go to the bathroom
like that?

1028
00:52:56,458 --> 00:52:58,750
Shohdy, I swear to God, I'll beat you up.

1029
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:00,500
You're handcuffed, son.

1030
00:53:00,583 --> 00:53:03,125
- Okay, give me a kiss and I'll uncuff you.
- Give him one.

1031
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:04,750
Where do you want me to kiss you?

1032
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:06,625
Let me think about it.
I'll get back to you.

1033
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:08,875
Shohdy, pull yourself together!

1034
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:12,333
Isn't the chair you made me
sleep on enough? My back is destroyed.

1035
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:15,142
Because you're selfish, and you
latched on to it as soon as you walked in.

1036
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:17,333
And it turned out to give the worst sleep!

1037
00:53:17,416 --> 00:53:20,416
Okay. Enough joking around, please.
Where's the nail for the chair?

1038
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,458
I told you I don't know where the nail is!

1039
00:53:22,541 --> 00:53:25,434
And I told you from the minute we arrived
that I haven't been here for ages!

1040
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:28,250
- Good morning, Mr. Shohdy.
- Hi, Mahi.

1041
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:35,208
Is this Mahi who tricked you and
turned your villa and office upside down?

1042
00:53:35,291 --> 00:53:36,541
She's pretty.

1043
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:37,875
You see?

1044
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:42,166
You made some lowly boatman ridicule me!

1045
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:43,583
Do you like that?

1046
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:45,375
Shohdy, don't take it seriously.

1047
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,250
She's a stranger. It's rude.

1048
00:53:48,333 --> 00:53:49,541
Good morning.

1049
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:53,791
I introduce myself to you.
Captain Hana Al Azaizy.

1050
00:53:53,875 --> 00:53:56,041
- Hello.
- Hello.

1051
00:53:56,875 --> 00:53:58,583
- What's going on?
- What?

1052
00:53:58,666 --> 00:53:59,666
You mean this?

1053
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:03,583
No, nothing. My arm was in a cast,
and then I took it off.

1054
00:54:03,666 --> 00:54:05,101
But I found myself feeling very tired.

1055
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:07,642
I went to the doctor, and he prescribed
these for me. They really help.

1056
00:54:07,666 --> 00:54:08,916
Can you uncuff me?

1057
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,666
I came over last night,
but Mostafa told me you had gone to sleep.

1058
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,333
Where is Mostafa, anyway?

1059
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:18,916
Of course, you have to ask about Mostafa
so he can defend you.

1060
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,625
But you made a mistake
and must be punished.

1061
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:25,416
Okay, can I have a word with you
on the side?

1062
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,875
Of course, dear. Go ahead.

1063
00:54:26,958 --> 00:54:28,958
I won't uncuff you, then. Stop it.

1064
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:30,875
Go ahead.

1065
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:37,625
- Mahi, you must know that what you did...
- Please, before you say anything…

1066
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,250
Here you go.

1067
00:54:42,458 --> 00:54:44,916
- What's this?
- $15,467.

1068
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,291
- For what?
- Your percentage from the business.

1069
00:54:48,125 --> 00:54:50,875
I considered you a partner, so that's 50%.

1070
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:53,875
Mahi, do you know how much I pay
to fill up my car?

1071
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:55,500
You probably don't even know yourself.

1072
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:58,833
You go to the gas station
and tell them to fill it up, that's it.

1073
00:54:58,916 --> 00:55:00,333
- Right?
- Right.

1074
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,583
- Right.
- So, do you forgive me?

1075
00:55:04,916 --> 00:55:06,250
Okay.

1076
00:55:06,333 --> 00:55:09,250
But you weren't like this at all.

1077
00:55:10,083 --> 00:55:13,323
If I knew staying here would've made you
like this, I'd have come a long time ago.

1078
00:55:14,083 --> 00:55:15,166
Made me what?

1079
00:55:15,791 --> 00:55:17,000
Smart.

1080
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:18,791
Come on.

1081
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:21,958
Come and have breakfast with us, Mahi.

1082
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:25,583
Thank you, Mr. Shohdy,
but my yoga class starts in an hour.

1083
00:55:25,666 --> 00:55:28,166
- So I better get going.
- All right, then.

1084
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:32,625
Could you please get my boat ready?
I want to take these kids out tomorrow.

1085
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:35,208
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

1086
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,833
Mahi, did you sell the boat?

1087
00:55:39,916 --> 00:55:41,708
Of course not!

1088
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:44,333
No, Mr. Shohdy,
I could never do that to you. It's just…

1089
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:48,875
that the Swedish group
are coming back with the boat on the 20th.

1090
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:50,083
After that, it's yours!

1091
00:55:50,166 --> 00:55:53,166
It is mine!

1092
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,291
- What will I do with you?
- I'm sorry!

1093
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:57,666
What will I do with you, you disaster!

1094
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:58,958
I won't do it again.

1095
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:01,708
Okay, get us a boat ready.

1096
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,875
The best boat for the best, Mr. Shohdy!

1097
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:06,416
Go on, go…

1098
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,208
How sweet.

1099
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:13,541
Wow.

1100
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:16,708
Mahi seems nice and good-natured.

1101
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:20,666
Azaizy, she's your daughter
who is Sarah's age, right?

1102
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,416
No, Sarah is much older.

1103
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,250
- Have you seen, Selim, Sarah's son?
- No.

1104
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:25,333
He's around her age.

1105
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:27,291
Guys, where's Hussein?
We're gonna be late.

1106
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:29,375
What for? Are they taking the sea away?

1107
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:31,250
What's this?

1108
00:56:31,916 --> 00:56:33,708
Hi, guys. Let's go.

1109
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:35,416
I'm going on holiday!

1110
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:41,916
Adel, come.

1111
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,625
No, I don't want to. You go.

1112
00:56:44,791 --> 00:56:46,000
Shohdy!

1113
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:38,750
Mahi.

1114
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:42,250
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1115
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:45,375
What's going on?

1116
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:50,291
Did you come to tell me good morning, or…

1117
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:53,458
And what are you wearing, Mostafa?

1118
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:56,875
Since when do you dress like this?
I'm always used to seeing you in a suit.

1119
00:57:56,958 --> 00:57:59,250
This is Mostafa's cool outfit.

1120
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:04,166
Did you just come to show me your outfit,
or were you going to say something?

1121
00:58:04,875 --> 00:58:06,083
What outfit, Mahi?

1122
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:08,875
First of all, I came to say that I…

1123
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:10,958
lied to you yesterday.

1124
00:58:11,791 --> 00:58:13,500
I didn't come here by chance.

1125
00:58:14,208 --> 00:58:16,416
As soon as I got the opportunity
to see you again,

1126
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,250
I couldn't stop myself.
I left everything and came.

1127
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:21,583
And then, as soon as I saw you,

1128
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:24,583
I forgot all the sadness,
and everything you did to me.

1129
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:27,541
And I told myself,
"God can turn things around."

1130
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:31,458
Why don't we open up
the topic of "us" again and reconsider?

1131
00:58:32,791 --> 00:58:34,666
And, to be honest,
I came to tell you that…

1132
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:38,625
I haven't forgotten, even though I tried.

1133
00:58:39,208 --> 00:58:40,666
I really tried, but…

1134
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:43,083
I couldn't forget you.

1135
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:46,916
And specifically,
when you left the company.

1136
00:58:47,583 --> 00:58:51,708
It would come to me sometimes.
Not always, but sometimes…

1137
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:55,541
"Why don't you go?"
And I would start thinking…

1138
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:58,041
You know, take... I'm going!

1139
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:00,541
No, wait.

1140
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:03,166
Keep going. Finish those two words
you were saying.

1141
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:05,458
Two words?
I wasn't planning on saying all this!

1142
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:08,791
I thought when you saw me in this, you'd
take me in your arms and that'd be it.

1143
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:12,291
How about
we have dinner together, tonight?

1144
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:15,416
I'll calm down, put my thoughts together,
and we can talk in peace.

1145
00:59:16,416 --> 00:59:17,666
I'm afraid I can't.

1146
00:59:18,416 --> 00:59:19,416
I'm leaving.

1147
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,916
- Wait.
- I already prepared myself.

1148
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,208
I'm not shocked or anything.

1149
00:59:22,291 --> 00:59:23,875
- Can you wait?
- You're all the same!

1150
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:25,416
Wait!

1151
00:59:26,833 --> 00:59:28,041
Listen!

1152
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:31,875
Tonight, I'm working. I have work tonight.

1153
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:34,041
So, tomorrow would work?

1154
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:36,250
Yes, tomorrow works.

1155
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:41,125
Okay, great.
But it will be lunch and dinner.

1156
00:59:42,166 --> 00:59:43,625
Lunch is on me, dinner's on you.

1157
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:45,291
No, sorry, that won't do.

1158
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:47,583
Call me old-fashioned, backwards.
I don't care.

1159
00:59:47,666 --> 00:59:49,083
Lunch is on me, dinner's on you.

1160
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:51,750
Dinner! What, am I gonna pay for a yogurt?

1161
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:52,833
Okay, bye.

1162
01:00:01,541 --> 01:00:03,916
- Wow!
- Wow!

1163
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,375
How I long for a date,
but the palm tree is too tall…

1164
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:07,541
Oh, mother.

1165
01:00:07,625 --> 01:00:08,750
Play with me!

1166
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,916
No, I have to be at the meeting.

1167
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:15,541
Don't stare. Otherwise,
that guy she's with will notice.

1168
01:00:15,625 --> 01:00:17,666
Look as though
you're gazing out at the sea,

1169
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,666
and then peek
out of the corner of your eyes.

1170
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:20,791
Good idea.

1171
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:22,083
Like this?

1172
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:26,666
- Is that the corner of your eye?
- I'm not wearing sunglasses like you guys.

1173
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,291
Question.

1174
01:00:30,375 --> 01:00:35,291
Are girls that pretty
because of makeup or because of clothes?

1175
01:00:36,625 --> 01:00:41,416
So, if your wife wore the same clothes
and the same makeup,

1176
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,833
would she look like that?

1177
01:00:42,916 --> 01:00:44,500
She'd get shouted at!

1178
01:00:46,125 --> 01:00:47,375
No, no.

1179
01:00:47,458 --> 01:00:48,666
It's a must.

1180
01:00:49,708 --> 01:00:52,666
What a scumbag. He left the girl.

1181
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:53,791
Heartless guy.

1182
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:55,125
What a failure.

1183
01:00:56,125 --> 01:00:58,250
He left her
to someone who would appreciate her.

1184
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:01,125
Calm down, Wizwiz.

1185
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:08,708
- What's this crazy guy gonna do?
- What do you think? He's gonna get her.

1186
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:12,000
How is he gonna get her
with that double chin of his?

1187
01:01:12,083 --> 01:01:14,250
I'll bet you 800 pounds
that she'll shout at him.

1188
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:15,958
Why not make it 1000?

1189
01:01:16,041 --> 01:01:18,416
That's a lot, Doola. He's not worth it.

1190
01:01:19,291 --> 01:01:21,750
And back to the matches of the past!

1191
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:24,375
The big player who is back from abroad
is approaching!

1192
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:26,498
This is the phase in which
he tries to suss her out.

1193
01:01:26,541 --> 01:01:29,458
Today's match is amazing.
The rocket is in front of him.

1194
01:01:29,541 --> 01:01:32,416
He has the ball. He passed the test!

1195
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,791
The rocket took the ball from him
and smiled!

1196
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:38,583
He is getting closer!

1197
01:01:38,666 --> 01:01:42,291
She is getting closer!

1198
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:49,500
Where are those 1000 pounds?

1199
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:51,333
First of all, it was 800.

1200
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:54,541
- Second, I'm requesting VAR.
- You have the right to.

1201
01:01:57,125 --> 01:02:00,625
How is it going, you cosmopolitan?
Can I play the next game?

1202
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:01,750
No way!

1203
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:03,958
By the way, I'm Shohdy's friend.

1204
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:06,851
- We're one and the same.
- What are you doing?

1205
01:02:06,875 --> 01:02:09,458
- I'm playing.
- With who? Do you know them?

1206
01:02:09,541 --> 01:02:11,166
- What are you looking at?
- The match.

1207
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,833
- Because it's really hot.
- It's on fire.

1208
01:02:13,916 --> 01:02:16,041
What's hot and on fire?
Are you messing around?

1209
01:02:16,125 --> 01:02:17,750
Wait a minute. You should watch

1210
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:19,753
how you're speaking
and who you're speaking with.

1211
01:02:19,833 --> 01:02:21,913
Who are you? You look like
you couldn't take a fight.

1212
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:24,750
Fight with who? Are you out of your mind?

1213
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:27,083
Or are you looking to show off
your muscles?

1214
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:31,500
You better wake up and get it together,
or you won't like what's coming.

1215
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:33,666
Take your hands off me
so I don't push you.

1216
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,333
Don't take your t-shirt off, Adel,
I beg you.

1217
01:02:36,416 --> 01:02:37,416
What's going on?

1218
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,083
Where is the manager of this place?
He took her and left.

1219
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:43,000
What do you need the manager for?
I'll be his sponsor.

1220
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:44,517
Calm down. What are you going to do?

1221
01:02:44,541 --> 01:02:46,875
He's trying to scare us
with his muscles, Hussein!

1222
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:49,375
I've been training in boxing
since before you were born!

1223
01:02:49,458 --> 01:02:52,000
Don't overdo it, Adel.
Your words don't match your body.

1224
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:54,601
- It's not about the body, Shohdy.
- Then what is it about, Doola?

1225
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:56,708
- Come on, Azaizy.
- Check it out.

1226
01:02:56,791 --> 01:02:59,708
That guy is bringing some heavyweights
and coming towards us.

1227
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:01,416
It's gonna be trouble.

1228
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:04,291
What do you say, Doodoo?
Shall we carry on?

1229
01:03:04,375 --> 01:03:06,267
No, I'll leave him to learn his lesson
another way.

1230
01:03:06,291 --> 01:03:07,958
- Shall we go?
- Let's go…

1231
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,708
Come here, Grandpa!

1232
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:21,500
Where is the nail for this sofa, Shohdy?
My neck is going to break!

1233
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:25,333
Hold tight, I've sent for some painkillers
from the pharmacy.

1234
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:29,500
That's enough with all these noises.
Azouz, you've given us a headache.

1235
01:03:29,583 --> 01:03:31,458
What's the problem, Shohdy?
The man is in pain.

1236
01:03:33,333 --> 01:03:35,767
Why can't you just pull yourself together?
This is unbelievable!

1237
01:03:35,791 --> 01:03:37,851
And, you, hurry the pharmacy up.
Let's get this over with!

1238
01:03:37,875 --> 01:03:42,958
Wait. I'm getting the number of a dealer
who apparently has some really good stuff.

1239
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:45,083
What are you? Satan?

1240
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:47,375
Alcohol by day and weed by night!

1241
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:49,291
And then there's the girls!

1242
01:03:49,375 --> 01:03:51,458
I hope you feel better, Zizo.

1243
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,791
The medicine is here! Nobody move.

1244
01:03:53,875 --> 01:03:55,750
I'll do everything from here on out.

1245
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:57,708
I will sweep, mop and cook.

1246
01:03:57,791 --> 01:04:00,541
But you stay resting because of your neck.

1247
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:03,750
You didn't tell me,
did you want a boy or a girl?

1248
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:04,875
Do you think I'm pregnant?

1249
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,208
Go, go!

1250
01:04:07,291 --> 01:04:10,375
- It's over between us now!
- Go.

1251
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:15,375
I hope he feels better, sir.

1252
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:16,791
Hudhud?

1253
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:19,833
Are you a driver or working in a pharmacy?
What's your deal?

1254
01:04:19,916 --> 01:04:21,875
I'm full of skills but out of luck.

1255
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:23,559
What matters
is that you earn your living with honor.

1256
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:25,250
Wow, Hudhud. An example for the youth.

1257
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:27,041
Mostafa, bring the painkiller!

1258
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:29,059
Coming! I'll give him the painkiller,
then pay you.

1259
01:04:29,083 --> 01:04:31,403
- Do you know the guy who sells sweets?
- He is my darling!

1260
01:04:31,791 --> 01:04:33,000
Hurry up.

1261
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:36,166
Good news, I hope.

1262
01:04:36,875 --> 01:04:38,208
Hello, who is this?

1263
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:42,500
Selim Al Nohly gave me your number
and said that you have good stuff.

1264
01:04:42,583 --> 01:04:44,291
Yes, sir. Where should I come to you?

1265
01:04:44,375 --> 01:04:47,583
- Do you know Masoud House?
- Of course I do, I'm in it!

1266
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:50,000
- What do you mean "in it"?
- I'm here now.

1267
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:51,833
Sir Shohdy!

1268
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:57,083
You're a dealer too, Hudhud?
And in my house? I'll lock you up!

1269
01:04:57,166 --> 01:04:58,517
Why, Sir Shohdy? I'm your darling.

1270
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:00,583
- Show me what you've got.
- Of course.

1271
01:05:01,458 --> 01:05:04,333
No, Adel, the cream you put on stings.

1272
01:05:04,416 --> 01:05:06,166
And the painkiller isn't doing anything.

1273
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:10,500
- Take it off, Adel. I can't handle it.
- Azaizy, you only took the painkiller.

1274
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:12,333
So it hasn't had the chance to work yet.

1275
01:05:12,416 --> 01:05:14,791
And this cream is magical…

1276
01:05:17,083 --> 01:05:18,291
I'm sorry, Azaizy.

1277
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:20,583
- What's up, Adel?
- I messed up.

1278
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:23,750
I bought a cream for hernias,
not for sprains.

1279
01:05:24,666 --> 01:05:26,083
They're both the same color.

1280
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:29,375
You've given me a hernia after the sprain!

1281
01:05:38,666 --> 01:05:41,625
You guys stay.
I'm tired. I'm gonna go back.

1282
01:05:41,708 --> 01:05:43,833
- Why are you tired, Azaizy? What's up?
- I can't.

1283
01:05:43,916 --> 01:05:48,250
I brought you here
so I could give you a fun excursion.

1284
01:05:48,333 --> 01:05:50,708
- And here we are.
- No, I don't want to.

1285
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:52,625
Fine, that's up to you.

1286
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:56,333
Hi, Shohdy!

1287
01:05:56,416 --> 01:05:57,416
Oh, dear.

1288
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,375
Go on, Azaizy. Leave.

1289
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:05,416
What do you mean "leave"?

1290
01:06:05,916 --> 01:06:08,500
There's no going back. No surrender.
Take this.

1291
01:06:09,708 --> 01:06:11,958
- Come.
- Oh, dear.

1292
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:14,416
Come on, you boatman. You scumbag.

1293
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,125
- Come on. Don't be scared.
- I'm not scared of the yacht.

1294
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:20,833
Welcome to Mermaid Yacht!

1295
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:22,875
What are you doing here, Hudhud?

1296
01:06:22,958 --> 01:06:25,083
I'm the captain of the yacht.

1297
01:06:25,666 --> 01:06:27,458
Are you the only driver in this place?

1298
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:29,142
Whoever has God on his side
can do anything!

1299
01:06:29,166 --> 01:06:32,291
- Come on, Adel.
- No, I'm not coming with you.

1300
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:36,416
Don't give me a hard time. I'm not coming.
I'm going to stay in the villa.

1301
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,791
- Fine, I'll stay with you.
- You guys go and have fun with...

1302
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:42,250
- You have fun.
- Adel, enough of this mother's talk.

1303
01:06:42,333 --> 01:06:45,291
"You guys go and have fun and play
while I prepare your lunch."

1304
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,791
Let's go.

1305
01:06:47,458 --> 01:06:50,166
Fine, I'm staying with you, I'm not going.

1306
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:54,500
Bye, Shohdy!

1307
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:02,041
Oh, boy… did you see that, Adel?

1308
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,125
Why don't you loosen up, Adel?

1309
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:08,875
- I'm loose.
- No, you're not loose, Adel.

1310
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:10,583
This isn't the Adel we know.

1311
01:07:10,666 --> 01:07:15,541
The Adel we know would have had us
getting into hijinks on a trip like this

1312
01:07:15,625 --> 01:07:17,041
and made us stay up all night.

1313
01:07:17,125 --> 01:07:19,750
Adel, may God bless Abeer's soul.

1314
01:07:19,833 --> 01:07:21,916
She was sick, and now she is at peace.

1315
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,125
And you should thank God
that it came on gradually

1316
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,375
and wasn't a surprise.

1317
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:28,625
Thank God. May God bless her soul.

1318
01:07:28,708 --> 01:07:32,000
God bless. May God bless her
and have mercy on her.

1319
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:35,208
But you, how long will you stay
like this, my friend?

1320
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:37,500
- Until I go up to her.
- Dear God!

1321
01:07:37,583 --> 01:07:41,041
What's up, Adel? What have I been saying
since this morning?

1322
01:07:41,125 --> 01:07:44,791
Adel, do you remember when my father died,
and I shut myself away?

1323
01:07:44,875 --> 01:07:47,416
And I left work
and everything went downhill for me?

1324
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,833
You're the one who came and told me,

1325
01:07:49,916 --> 01:07:54,208
"Shohdy, you can't do this.
There are so many things to live for."

1326
01:07:54,291 --> 01:07:59,416
Everything I'm telling you now
is exactly what you told me. Remember?

1327
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:02,083
This isn't you, Adool.
We can't take more misery.

1328
01:08:04,958 --> 01:08:06,208
I tell you what, Adel.

1329
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,291
Don't be upset with me for asking.

1330
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,625
Would you think about marrying again?

1331
01:08:10,708 --> 01:08:13,000
No, that won't work anymore.

1332
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:15,458
- You can't get married anymore?
- No, no.

1333
01:08:16,083 --> 01:08:17,750
No, it's not what you think.

1334
01:08:17,833 --> 01:08:20,541
- You mean you can't get married at all?
- Well, not "at all."

1335
01:08:21,625 --> 01:08:24,500
Then I'll tell you "Rest in peace."
Get up.

1336
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:27,017
Come on. Let's find something to eat.
I don't know what to feed you.

1337
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:29,916
- Feed me some trotters and I'll show you.
- No, the mood is ruined now.

1338
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,625
- It's ruined? Completely ruined?
- Completely!

1339
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:36,875
I also want to develop the safari tours.

1340
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:40,666
So it's not just barbecues
and beach buggies

1341
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,375
and people sitting around a fire.

1342
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:44,583
I feel there are better ideas.

1343
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,416
- There should be more revamping.
- Yeah.

1344
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:47,916
Enough about work, Mahi.

1345
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,083
Why have you become
so enthusiastic all of a sudden?

1346
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:52,291
Will you spend the rest of your life here?

1347
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:55,250
Maybe. I haven't really thought about it.

1348
01:08:55,333 --> 01:08:57,708
I guess it didn't get through to you.
I'll explain.

1349
01:08:57,791 --> 01:08:59,833
Do you think you might find a decent man

1350
01:08:59,916 --> 01:09:02,666
that would relieve you
from all this work and let you stay home?

1351
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:05,333
We'll see
when that decent man comes along!

1352
01:09:05,416 --> 01:09:07,476
He's come all this way,
and you're giving him a tough time!

1353
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:08,791
All right, all right.

1354
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:10,392
Where have you been, Mostafa?

1355
01:09:10,416 --> 01:09:12,458
I've been looking for you
since this morning.

1356
01:09:12,541 --> 01:09:14,416
- I'm here, Mr. Shohdy.
- What do you mean?

1357
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,833
Are you here on holiday?

1358
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
- What's happened, Mr. Shohdy?
- Never mind "what happened" and "Mr.".

1359
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:21,083
This won't do.

1360
01:09:21,166 --> 01:09:25,750
You kept insisting on coming with me,
so we said two days would be fine.

1361
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:28,375
But we can't both stay away
from the company.

1362
01:09:28,458 --> 01:09:30,166
Who is gonna get the work done?

1363
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:32,166
Go ahead, now,

1364
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:35,958
and sort out the price list
for our trips to Luxor and Aswan.

1365
01:09:36,041 --> 01:09:37,541
Send them to Rana, the secretary.

1366
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:39,625
- Okay?
- Yes.

1367
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,916
Okay. I'll call you tonight.

1368
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:47,166
Mr. Shohdy, we were actually talking

1369
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:50,333
- about the development of the company.
- I'm not worried about anything

1370
01:09:50,416 --> 01:09:52,583
or the development of the company.

1371
01:09:52,666 --> 01:09:54,500
I feel very reassured.

1372
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:17,500
By the way, this yacht is very small.

1373
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:20,750
I'm not used to being the captain
of such a small yacht.

1374
01:10:21,333 --> 01:10:23,125
I captain large boats.

1375
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:25,291
And I've been all around Europe.

1376
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:28,250
I've been to Malta, Greece, Cyprus.

1377
01:10:28,333 --> 01:10:33,083
I've been to every street, alley and path
in Europe.

1378
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:34,375
By boat!

1379
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:38,166
Good. That's an advantage.

1380
01:10:38,916 --> 01:10:41,083
But you're gorgeous, gorgeous!

1381
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:45,625
Go easy.
Girls aren't good for your blood sugar.

1382
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:48,833
What do you want? Let me have some fun.

1383
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:50,625
Don't ruin the day, son.

1384
01:10:50,708 --> 01:10:52,916
The day will be wonderful.

1385
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:56,541
What's this? I haven't had the chance to…

1386
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,666
What's this?

1387
01:10:59,416 --> 01:11:00,916
What happened, Captain?

1388
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,125
The boat stopped.

1389
01:11:03,208 --> 01:11:05,666
I think it's out of gas.

1390
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:07,875
Didn't you fill it up before we left?

1391
01:11:07,958 --> 01:11:11,291
Of course! I filled it up
according to the itinerary of the trip.

1392
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:14,583
And you've been going
round in circles for six hours!

1393
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:17,958
You didn't give the boat a rest
or park it anywhere.

1394
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:21,416
Why didn't you say
we needed to rest it for a bit?

1395
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:24,458
Because some things are felt, not spoken.

1396
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:26,875
And every time I came to speak to you,
you ignored me.

1397
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:28,750
What does this mean?

1398
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:31,291
It means
you are dinner for the fishes tonight.

1399
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:33,250
You're going to die here tonight!

1400
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:35,291
Wait!

1401
01:11:38,625 --> 01:11:41,625
Dear God!

1402
01:11:41,708 --> 01:11:43,791
I'm having a panic attack.

1403
01:11:43,875 --> 01:11:45,625
Help me!

1404
01:11:45,708 --> 01:11:47,708
If I get an attack and start dying,

1405
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:50,958
then give me CPR!

1406
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:55,541
Don't worry.
I'll call somebody to rescue us.

1407
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:59,000
- My phone has no network.
- There's no signal out at sea.

1408
01:11:59,083 --> 01:12:02,708
I have a signal.
Just to let you know I'm special.

1409
01:12:03,416 --> 01:12:05,291
Hussein, I'll call Adel. Don't worry.

1410
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,875
Adel's phone is switched off.

1411
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:08,583
Call Shohdy.

1412
01:12:08,666 --> 01:12:11,875
No! I'd rather die than call that jerk!

1413
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,500
- Hi, Shohdy!
- Shohdy!

1414
01:12:30,625 --> 01:12:35,125
You should have let Hudhud be the captain.
You're a disgrace to boatmen!

1415
01:12:35,208 --> 01:12:38,625
I could have come back swimming.

1416
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:42,000
I just didn't want to leave
Hussein and these poor girls.

1417
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:44,000
You're being arrogant, too?

1418
01:12:44,083 --> 01:12:45,625
You know what?

1419
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:48,500
I won't give you the tank of gas
until you apologize.

1420
01:12:48,583 --> 01:12:51,208
I swear to God, I'll make this boat
run on sugarcane juice

1421
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:53,000
before I apologize to a jerk like you!

1422
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:55,833
Guys, stop these childish antics!

1423
01:12:55,916 --> 01:12:58,083
- This is unbelievable.
- You can see, Adel.

1424
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:00,625
Azaizy, tell him "I'm sorry"!
Let's get this over with!

1425
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:03,291
Okay.

1426
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:05,875
I know how to make him come.

1427
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,833
Say something to him, girls.

1428
01:13:08,916 --> 01:13:11,375
- Please, Shohdy!
- Please!

1429
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:16,750
Ouch, he's hitting me
right where it hurts.

1430
01:13:21,625 --> 01:13:23,125
He says he captains boats.

1431
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:26,916
He can barely cross
the canal in Mariouteya.

1432
01:13:29,416 --> 01:13:31,083
Stop. I don't like the coals too hot.

1433
01:13:32,958 --> 01:13:36,083
Mariouteya and the canal.
That's enough, you joker.

1434
01:13:36,791 --> 01:13:41,458
Guys, it's really hot up here.

1435
01:13:42,166 --> 01:13:44,458
Hussein, stop being so stupid, please.

1436
01:13:45,333 --> 01:13:49,291
Haven't you heard people say,
"What is this heat? Are we in a sauna?"

1437
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:52,333
- This is the sauna, Hussein.
- Really?

1438
01:13:53,083 --> 01:13:55,750
I thought a sauna was a hot country,
like Aswan.

1439
01:13:56,416 --> 01:14:00,833
There is actually a country called sauna.
Sauna Land. But this isn't it.

1440
01:14:02,333 --> 01:14:05,291
I made this sauna in the house,

1441
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:10,208
specifically so we can smoke
this fake cigarette

1442
01:14:10,291 --> 01:14:14,083
in this stuffy room and get really high.

1443
01:14:14,708 --> 01:14:17,291
- Zizo, light it up.
- Zizo?

1444
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:19,958
I'm not into these games.
I'm better than that.

1445
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:22,166
- Here, take it.
- You tough guy!

1446
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,541
Take it, Hussein.

1447
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:27,708
If he takes a puff,
he'll be completely knocked out.

1448
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:31,934
Shohdy, if you want to smoke that,
smoke it yourself. We're not into that.

1449
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:33,791
Speak for yourself!

1450
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:37,583
You know what? You guys are no fun at all.
I won't have any either then.

1451
01:14:37,666 --> 01:14:39,791
Here it goes.

1452
01:14:46,458 --> 01:14:47,666
Guys?

1453
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:52,583
I have a big problem.

1454
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:57,500
I can't breathe or move my arm.

1455
01:14:58,458 --> 01:15:00,583
That's the benefit of the sauna, Hussein.

1456
01:15:01,916 --> 01:15:07,333
It opens up the pores
and completely loosens you up.

1457
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:09,375
See how loose I am?

1458
01:15:09,458 --> 01:15:10,708
Loose…

1459
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:20,958
Zizo, are you going cross-eyed?

1460
01:15:22,458 --> 01:15:24,125
Oh, God…

1461
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:30,625
It's an app I found on my phone
that I make videos on.

1462
01:15:30,708 --> 01:15:33,375
It drives me nuts. It drives me nuts.

1463
01:15:33,875 --> 01:15:35,375
Why don't you show us, Azaizy?

1464
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:37,291
- No, no, no.
- Please, show us.

1465
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:38,916
For my sake.

1466
01:15:40,291 --> 01:15:41,875
Show me!

1467
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:44,000
I'm the one who discovered it.

1468
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:47,000
Don't say that you already know about it.

1469
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:50,916
What's this?

1470
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:58,416
Mostafa, when was the last time
you danced?

1471
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:01,020
I dance all the time!
I was dancing two days ago for Mr. Shohdy.

1472
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:05,083
- You were dancing for Mr. Shohdy?
- Yeah, so he could sign papers for me.

1473
01:18:05,166 --> 01:18:08,458
He made you dance for him
to sign something?

1474
01:18:09,041 --> 01:18:10,921
You've never danced
so he'd sign papers for you?

1475
01:18:10,958 --> 01:18:13,708
- Of course not!
- He told me the whole company does that.

1476
01:18:14,916 --> 01:18:17,000
He's a sick man!

1477
01:18:17,916 --> 01:18:19,041
Okay, okay.

1478
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:23,208
Let me show you some new dance moves.
So next time, you can dazzle him!

1479
01:18:23,291 --> 01:18:24,500
Come on!

1480
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:28,458
Mahi, why don't you think about
coming back to Cairo with me?

1481
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:33,333
I don't like to think when I'm dancing.
You don't want me to quit dancing, right?

1482
01:18:33,416 --> 01:18:35,458
Did I ask you to quit medicine?
I'm being serious.

1483
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,375
I want a serious answer from you now.

1484
01:18:38,458 --> 01:18:40,541
I don't want to feel
suspended in the air, Mahi.

1485
01:18:40,625 --> 01:18:43,101
Don't be mad, but I feel like
you're not thinking about the subject.

1486
01:18:43,125 --> 01:18:45,875
- Who said I'm not thinking about it?
- Are you being serious?

1487
01:18:45,958 --> 01:18:48,833
- What have you decided?
- I haven't made a decision. I'm thinking.

1488
01:18:50,666 --> 01:18:51,666
And I told you before,

1489
01:18:52,583 --> 01:18:54,416
this decision isn't easy for me.

1490
01:18:55,583 --> 01:18:56,750
I have to consider things.

1491
01:18:56,833 --> 01:18:59,416
Mahi, you don't have to sit down
and calculate everything.

1492
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,458
There are some things that you just feel.

1493
01:19:01,541 --> 01:19:03,125
Who told you I don't feel anything?

1494
01:19:03,208 --> 01:19:05,791
Really? How do you feel?
Tell me what you're feeling.

1495
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:08,375
- I feel, I feel...
- Just tell me.

1496
01:19:10,708 --> 01:19:13,000
I feel that I'm happy.

1497
01:19:14,125 --> 01:19:16,875
- You swear that you're happy?
- Yes, I feel happy.

1498
01:19:16,958 --> 01:19:20,875
Okay, hang on. This could go somewhere
really nice that I hadn't planned for.

1499
01:19:21,375 --> 01:19:24,500
Do you feel happy in general,
or when you think about this topic?

1500
01:19:24,583 --> 01:19:27,208
When I think about
this topic specifically, I feel happy.

1501
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:28,666
- Really?
- Yes!

1502
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:30,041
Why didn't you tell me?

1503
01:19:30,125 --> 01:19:32,083
Come on. Let's celebrate happiness!

1504
01:19:32,166 --> 01:19:33,166
Come on, then.

1505
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:37,500
Mostafa! Mostafa!

1506
01:19:39,083 --> 01:19:40,875
Nice one, Azouz!

1507
01:19:40,958 --> 01:19:42,208
May all be well.

1508
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:45,916
- Sorry, Sahsah.
- I'm gonna have a cigarette.

1509
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,375
Since when?

1510
01:19:47,458 --> 01:19:49,750
One while I'm on holiday.

1511
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:53,291
Guys, I feel like we're too old
for all this silliness.

1512
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:57,083
What do you mean, "too old"?
You know what?

1513
01:19:57,166 --> 01:20:00,916
This trip has proven to me
that we are still little kids.

1514
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,208
Yeah.

1515
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:06,041
- I want to get your opinion on something.
- Talk.

1516
01:20:07,166 --> 01:20:08,583
I'm thinking of getting engaged.

1517
01:20:10,708 --> 01:20:13,125
- Stop being silly.
- Is marriage silly?

1518
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:15,875
Why are you looking to get married
when you're about to die?

1519
01:20:16,916 --> 01:20:19,000
A couple of days of pleasure.

1520
01:20:19,791 --> 01:20:23,333
Besides, you guys lived your lives
and got married and had fun.

1521
01:20:23,416 --> 01:20:26,916
You yourself used to always tell me,
"Think about marriage, Shohdy."

1522
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,083
Remember?

1523
01:20:28,166 --> 01:20:30,375
And maybe when I get married,
I'll have fun?

1524
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:35,375
Being happy is not guaranteed.

1525
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:38,625
Why are you saying that?

1526
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:40,958
What happened with Sherine, Hana?

1527
01:20:42,166 --> 01:20:44,208
The strange thing is
nothing is happening.

1528
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,333
It's silence, Adel.

1529
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:49,583
It's like there's no dialogue left.

1530
01:20:50,416 --> 01:20:52,250
We have nothing to talk about.

1531
01:20:52,833 --> 01:20:55,583
What silence? You don't stop talking here.

1532
01:20:55,666 --> 01:20:56,875
You're right.

1533
01:20:57,666 --> 01:21:00,500
That's what's driving me crazy.
I can't seem to solve it.

1534
01:21:01,541 --> 01:21:03,083
I never meant to do that to her.

1535
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:06,791
Maybe,

1536
01:21:07,583 --> 01:21:09,416
there's just nothing left to talk about.

1537
01:21:10,416 --> 01:21:11,625
Maybe I got bored of her,

1538
01:21:11,708 --> 01:21:14,208
especially after the kids
grew up and left home.

1539
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:16,708
I don't know.

1540
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:20,416
It requires effort, Azaizy.

1541
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:25,291
You have to think the way she thinks.

1542
01:21:26,166 --> 01:21:27,916
Look at things from her point of view.

1543
01:21:29,708 --> 01:21:33,333
What questions does she ask you
that upset you?

1544
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:35,625
The same questions.

1545
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,583
"Where are you taking me out to tonight?"

1546
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,833
"What would you like to eat tonight?"

1547
01:21:41,916 --> 01:21:43,833
Let's just go wherever!

1548
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:46,416
Let's eat whatever!

1549
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:50,041
It's been the same questions for 30 years!

1550
01:21:50,125 --> 01:21:51,541
You're a fool.

1551
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:55,416
When she asks you
where you should go out tonight,

1552
01:21:55,958 --> 01:21:58,458
she wants to take you
somewhere you'll enjoy.

1553
01:21:58,541 --> 01:22:00,291
But when you tell her "anywhere,"

1554
01:22:01,708 --> 01:22:03,916
you make her feel like
going out is pointless.

1555
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:05,916
Like she's not important to you.

1556
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:08,541
Take care of her, Azaizy.

1557
01:22:09,041 --> 01:22:10,291
Answer her questions.

1558
01:22:11,083 --> 01:22:12,416
Let her feel her worth.

1559
01:22:13,125 --> 01:22:15,875
By the way,
she doesn't care about your response.

1560
01:22:16,625 --> 01:22:18,083
She cares about your interest.

1561
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:21,458
It really makes a difference to them.

1562
01:22:24,541 --> 01:22:26,250
God bless you, Adel.

1563
01:22:27,583 --> 01:22:32,333
My problem isn't with silence.

1564
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:38,791
What bothers me is the noise.

1565
01:22:41,250 --> 01:22:44,125
"Dad, the fridge is empty."
"Dad, the plumber."

1566
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:45,750
"Dad, pass by the dry cleaners."

1567
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:48,958
"Dad, won't you get me some Eid clothes?"
"Dad, Eid money. Dad!"

1568
01:22:52,791 --> 01:22:55,666
The kids treat me like…

1569
01:22:57,916 --> 01:22:59,333
I'm a Visa card.

1570
01:23:00,708 --> 01:23:01,916
An ATM…

1571
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:10,041
Something that buys things for them.

1572
01:23:11,125 --> 01:23:12,333
That's it.

1573
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:15,541
You know…

1574
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:19,333
today,

1575
01:23:20,458 --> 01:23:21,958
today is my birthday.

1576
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:24,958
It's fine.

1577
01:23:29,333 --> 01:23:33,916
Nobody called me
to wish me a happy birthday.

1578
01:23:35,125 --> 01:23:37,041
They do that to me every time.

1579
01:23:38,958 --> 01:23:40,166
I swear!

1580
01:23:42,833 --> 01:23:44,500
Even when they remember me…

1581
01:23:47,416 --> 01:23:52,208
they'll bring me a white cake
because they're the ones who like it.

1582
01:23:54,291 --> 01:23:56,916
I like chocolate cake.

1583
01:23:59,958 --> 01:24:01,333
Happy birthday, you jerk!

1584
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:06,500
How old are you, Sahsah?

1585
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:09,833
Sixty.

1586
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:13,750
You're really old.
I'll have to call you Uncle.

1587
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:15,916
Sixty years old?

1588
01:24:16,833 --> 01:24:18,875
You're about 30 years older than us.

1589
01:24:21,083 --> 01:24:23,375
- How did we become his friend?
- I don't get it.

1590
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:24,833
Hussein,

1591
01:24:25,375 --> 01:24:26,791
I am going to make you

1592
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:31,250
the biggest birthday party
you have ever seen.

1593
01:24:37,166 --> 01:24:38,416
Happy birthday, my dear!

1594
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:40,791
Thank you. Thank you all!

1595
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:43,666
I don't know what to say to you
or how to thank you.

1596
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,458
- Just say thank you, no big deal.
- Thank you, no big deal.

1597
01:24:46,541 --> 01:24:48,375
Okay, hero, make a wish.

1598
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:50,958
There's no better wish
than to live with my wife and kids.

1599
01:24:51,041 --> 01:24:52,833
May God give them strength and health

1600
01:24:52,916 --> 01:24:55,875
and a hard time like they give me!

1601
01:24:55,958 --> 01:24:57,583
You are annoying!

1602
01:24:57,666 --> 01:25:00,083
- You ruined my surprise!
- What surprise?

1603
01:25:02,291 --> 01:25:03,875
We miss you, Hussein!

1604
01:25:03,958 --> 01:25:07,041
The house is awful without you.
It has no feeling or taste.

1605
01:25:07,125 --> 01:25:10,333
I went to renew my passport.
Send someone to bring me over to you!

1606
01:25:11,541 --> 01:25:12,625
We really miss you, Dad.

1607
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:15,250
We wish you were here
so we could celebrate like every year.

1608
01:25:15,333 --> 01:25:17,916
But we're happy that you're happy
and having a change of scenery.

1609
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,200
Happy Birthday, father-in-law.

1610
01:25:20,666 --> 01:25:23,833
Happy birthday, Mr. Hussein. Beware,
you'll have another one when you're back!

1611
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:33,625
What's wrong? It was made by the person
who put your birthday together.

1612
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:35,458
What person?

1613
01:25:35,541 --> 01:25:37,875
When we talk to you,
do you just blabber nonsense?

1614
01:25:39,208 --> 01:25:42,375
Hussein, did you understand
what Boudy said to you?

1615
01:25:43,583 --> 01:25:45,250
Since when have I ever understood him?

1616
01:25:45,833 --> 01:25:48,114
He said "Don't forget to bring me a bike
on the way back."

1617
01:25:48,166 --> 01:25:49,750
The bike, of course.

1618
01:25:49,833 --> 01:25:53,041
Wait a minute, the phone's ringing.
What bike? Don't annoy me!

1619
01:25:53,125 --> 01:25:56,833
Boudy, tell me your mother
about your answer machine telescope…

1620
01:25:57,666 --> 01:25:59,625
Mahi, I need you for something.

1621
01:26:00,208 --> 01:26:01,500
Come over here.

1622
01:26:02,666 --> 01:26:04,875
How are you doing?
How is it going with her?

1623
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:06,458
She's still giving me a hard time.

1624
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,291
But the latest is that she said
she's happy and is still thinking.

1625
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:14,791
Very good! If she said she's happy
and is still thinking, then we're close!

1626
01:26:14,875 --> 01:26:16,392
Yeah, we are. But he should stay away.

1627
01:26:16,416 --> 01:26:18,875
What does he have to do with you?

1628
01:26:18,958 --> 01:26:23,000
He's all talk. I'll deal with him.
Don't you worry.

1629
01:26:41,375 --> 01:26:43,000
<i>Hi, Sherine. How are you?</i>

1630
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:46,333
<i>I found this funny,
so I thought I'd send it to you.</i>

1631
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:49,166
<i>I miss you.</i>

1632
01:26:50,083 --> 01:26:52,000
<i>I want to tell you something else.</i>

1633
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:53,833
<i>Don't ever be upset with me.</i>

1634
01:26:53,916 --> 01:26:55,416
<i>I love you.</i>

1635
01:26:55,500 --> 01:27:00,708
<i>I love you, I love you, I love you!</i>

1636
01:27:01,791 --> 01:27:04,500
<i>I love you!</i>

1637
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:08,916
You know what, Mahi?

1638
01:27:09,541 --> 01:27:12,583
I'm very happy
that you managed to settle here

1639
01:27:12,666 --> 01:27:14,541
and adapt to this place.

1640
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:17,583
I have decided to live here.

1641
01:27:20,708 --> 01:27:22,791
Live here how, Mr. Shohdy?

1642
01:27:22,875 --> 01:27:24,625
Move here.

1643
01:27:24,708 --> 01:27:28,208
I'll live at Masoud Center.

1644
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:31,458
"Unlimited Containment."

1645
01:27:33,458 --> 01:27:35,625
But after you tidy it up, of course.

1646
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:37,333
Mahi.

1647
01:27:41,166 --> 01:27:43,166
I want you to tidy up the villa for me.

1648
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:48,000
Furnish it, arrange it all to your taste.

1649
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,416
And we'll be next to each other!

1650
01:27:51,916 --> 01:27:53,291
What do you think?

1651
01:27:55,291 --> 01:27:57,541
I think this is a great idea, of course.

1652
01:27:58,083 --> 01:28:01,583
You being here
will help us develop the business.

1653
01:28:01,666 --> 01:28:02,875
Mahi!

1654
01:28:05,208 --> 01:28:09,458
The thing I noticed most about you
is that you're smart.

1655
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:14,958
Given that you're smart,
then you understand and I understand.

1656
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:19,250
And I understand
that you're not one for messing around.

1657
01:28:20,166 --> 01:28:22,166
That's why I'm talking seriously.

1658
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,166
Let's get close.

1659
01:28:27,291 --> 01:28:28,625
Let's stay together.

1660
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:31,833
And don't worry about the business at all.

1661
01:28:32,666 --> 01:28:35,208
Wherever I am living,

1662
01:28:35,291 --> 01:28:39,125
my business will be there by my side.

1663
01:28:39,708 --> 01:28:42,625
What do you think?
That's if you agree, of course.

1664
01:28:45,166 --> 01:28:49,083
- It's very hard...
- No, don't answer now.

1665
01:28:50,333 --> 01:28:51,541
Take your time.

1666
01:28:52,125 --> 01:28:55,708
I'll go to the toilet and come back,
and you'll have thought about it.

1667
01:28:56,375 --> 01:29:00,500
I think that's plenty of time
to be able to make a decision, right?

1668
01:29:11,375 --> 01:29:12,583
Have you thought?

1669
01:29:13,583 --> 01:29:15,250
Thought? About what?

1670
01:29:16,333 --> 01:29:17,333
Our topic?

1671
01:29:19,291 --> 01:29:21,708
What? I beg you, Mostafa,
this is not a good time.

1672
01:29:23,583 --> 01:29:26,458
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

1673
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:28,458
Not tomorrow. Not the day after. Now.

1674
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:31,250
Now, Mahi, please.

1675
01:29:31,958 --> 01:29:33,833
If you want an answer,
I honestly don't know!

1676
01:29:39,666 --> 01:29:40,875
Mostafa, can you leave?

1677
01:29:41,666 --> 01:29:43,375
Leave me some time to think.

1678
01:29:44,833 --> 01:29:48,000
Fine, Mahi. Don't stress yourself out.
I also don't want to stress myself out.

1679
01:29:48,541 --> 01:29:50,000
I get it.

1680
01:29:50,083 --> 01:29:52,208
You told me
you wanted to pursue your career first

1681
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:53,791
and then see about marriage.

1682
01:29:53,875 --> 01:29:55,708
It's clear
that you saw both things as one.

1683
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:59,208
I don't mean anything bad.

1684
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:01,208
That's smart of you. Well done.

1685
01:30:01,791 --> 01:30:04,291
I used to always say,
"Mahi is the smartest one of us all."

1686
01:30:05,708 --> 01:30:08,500
Mostafa, why aren't you dancing?

1687
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,708
- I have a headache.
- Headache?

1688
01:30:11,791 --> 01:30:15,583
Go to my villa, go into my bedroom.

1689
01:30:16,541 --> 01:30:19,916
You'll find a great pill for headaches
in the drawer of the bedside table.

1690
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,291
Take one.
It'll will make you feel much better.

1691
01:30:23,041 --> 01:30:24,291
I'll do that.

1692
01:30:24,791 --> 01:30:26,375
Either way, the party is dull.

1693
01:30:26,458 --> 01:30:27,750
I hope you feel better.

1694
01:30:33,041 --> 01:30:34,291
Mostafa, where are you going?

1695
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:37,500
- I'm going back to Cairo.
- Why?

1696
01:30:38,333 --> 01:30:39,875
Did Shohdy throw more work at you?

1697
01:30:40,583 --> 01:30:43,666
I've quit working for Shohdy.
I can't look him in the face again.

1698
01:30:45,208 --> 01:30:47,541
Sorry, Mr. Adel.
But your friend is a selfish man.

1699
01:30:50,916 --> 01:30:53,041
What would you like to drink?

1700
01:30:53,125 --> 01:30:55,875
Excuse me, Mahi.
I'd like to have a few words with Shohdy.

1701
01:31:10,541 --> 01:31:12,166
You're happy like this, right?

1702
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:14,833
Yeah, I'm very happy.

1703
01:31:14,916 --> 01:31:17,208
Aren't you happy, Adel?

1704
01:31:19,333 --> 01:31:21,000
What you're doing isn't right, Shohdy.

1705
01:31:22,333 --> 01:31:25,666
I don't know why you insist on taking
something that doesn't belong to you.

1706
01:31:26,208 --> 01:31:28,791
What is it that's not mine?

1707
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:32,333
- Mahi.
- Yeah, yeah.

1708
01:31:32,958 --> 01:31:36,625
We'll talk tomorrow then.
Leave me tonight.

1709
01:31:37,375 --> 01:31:38,833
No, I won't leave you, Shohdy.

1710
01:31:39,958 --> 01:31:41,916
Because you seem completely wasted!

1711
01:31:43,125 --> 01:31:44,208
What?

1712
01:31:44,291 --> 01:31:46,625
Do you think
she's one of those ladies that you know?

1713
01:31:46,708 --> 01:31:48,541
You date her for two months,
then dump her?

1714
01:31:49,125 --> 01:31:51,333
No, Shohdy. This girl is different.

1715
01:31:51,416 --> 01:31:52,666
Bravo!

1716
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:56,875
It's because this girl is different,
that's why I want to marry her.

1717
01:31:56,958 --> 01:31:58,958
Don't I have the right to get married?

1718
01:31:59,833 --> 01:32:01,500
Of course you do.

1719
01:32:02,208 --> 01:32:05,541
But you know,
you're aware that Mostafa loves her.

1720
01:32:05,625 --> 01:32:09,958
What does that have to do with me?
If he likes her or not, he can get lost!

1721
01:32:10,041 --> 01:32:11,625
Did I force her?

1722
01:32:11,708 --> 01:32:13,833
- Yes, Shohdy, you forced her.
- No!

1723
01:32:13,916 --> 01:32:17,708
You want to mislead her,
dazzle her with your money and position.

1724
01:32:18,333 --> 01:32:21,625
And you know exactly how ambitious
this girl is and what she wants!

1725
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:25,750
But what I don't understand is,
what are you trying to prove?

1726
01:32:25,833 --> 01:32:27,958
Are you trying to prove
that you're such a devil

1727
01:32:28,041 --> 01:32:30,166
you can get a girl your children's age?

1728
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:32,458
What do you want out of life, anyway?

1729
01:32:49,791 --> 01:32:51,750
I don't want to die alone, Adel.

1730
01:32:56,375 --> 01:32:58,416
I want to have a home, Adel.

1731
01:33:00,375 --> 01:33:02,000
I want to have a bed.

1732
01:33:03,625 --> 01:33:06,375
So that when I'm away from it
for two days, I miss it.

1733
01:33:07,708 --> 01:33:11,958
Adel, do you think that when I…

1734
01:33:13,041 --> 01:33:15,958
get to know a different girl every day
that it makes me happy?

1735
01:33:17,250 --> 01:33:18,458
No.

1736
01:33:19,916 --> 01:33:21,916
I get to know a different girl every day

1737
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:24,958
for companionship.

1738
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:30,500
I'm scared of dying alone, Adel.

1739
01:33:32,083 --> 01:33:33,666
I'm scared that I'll die,

1740
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:38,333
and you won't know about it
until my body starts smelling.

1741
01:33:45,166 --> 01:33:46,916
I think I have the right

1742
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,041
to have people that take care of me

1743
01:33:51,833 --> 01:33:55,875
and will keep remembering me
like you remember Abeer.

1744
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,666
Don't you think
that would be better, Adel?

1745
01:34:01,291 --> 01:34:05,666
Rather than having them go to
Hamdiyah Shazliya to have a cup of coffee,

1746
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:08,083
lick their lips,

1747
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:09,458
and say God bless his soul.

1748
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,875
Have you understood what I want, Adel?

1749
01:34:16,458 --> 01:34:17,500
You're right, Shohdy.

1750
01:34:18,958 --> 01:34:20,375
You're right.

1751
01:34:21,541 --> 01:34:23,750
I was the first one
to tell you to get married.

1752
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:28,000
But not this one, Shohdy.
She's not the one for you, my friend.

1753
01:34:28,083 --> 01:34:31,916
What do you mean, "not this one"?
Are we in the supermarket?

1754
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,875
Where we can walk and choose as we please?

1755
01:34:33,958 --> 01:34:36,083
Shohdy, the world won't stand still
over one person.

1756
01:34:38,541 --> 01:34:40,791
Well, what is this?

1757
01:34:41,666 --> 01:34:45,791
Are you the one saying that the world
won't stand still over one person?

1758
01:34:46,541 --> 01:34:50,458
When all that's happening here is for you!

1759
01:34:50,958 --> 01:34:56,625
To bring you back to life
after what happened to you with Abeer.

1760
01:34:58,083 --> 01:34:59,291
Please, Shohdy.

1761
01:34:59,833 --> 01:35:02,083
Don't talk about Abeer when you're drunk!

1762
01:35:02,166 --> 01:35:05,291
Because I don't like what you're saying.
I don't want to lose you as a friend.

1763
01:35:05,375 --> 01:35:07,791
- We'll talk later!
- No, Adel!

1764
01:35:08,291 --> 01:35:09,541
I don't want to talk at all!

1765
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:12,142
And whoever doesn't like it
can bang their head against the wall!

1766
01:35:12,166 --> 01:35:14,708
- Don't talk like that, Shohdy.
- Have some respect, Adel.

1767
01:35:14,791 --> 01:35:16,250
Adel, what's wrong?

1768
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:19,000
Take note of what you're saying.

1769
01:35:19,083 --> 01:35:21,041
- Come with me.
- Stop it, Azaizy.

1770
01:35:21,125 --> 01:35:23,291
He's talking badly to me.

1771
01:35:23,375 --> 01:35:24,416
Are you drunk?

1772
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:28,500
Is everyone gonna keep asking me
if I'm drunk? I'm not drunk!

1773
01:35:30,416 --> 01:35:33,166
- You'll get everyone on our case now!
- That's enough, Azaizy!

1774
01:35:33,250 --> 01:35:35,666
What's wrong?

1775
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:37,000
Ouch…

1776
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,583
What is this foolishness, you moron?

1777
01:35:39,666 --> 01:35:42,333
- We're sorry. It wasn't his fault.
- Wait. It's you again?

1778
01:35:42,916 --> 01:35:45,208
If you guys can't handle your alcohol,
why get drunk?

1779
01:35:45,291 --> 01:35:47,434
Come on. The man's not feeling well.
It wasn't his fault!

1780
01:35:47,458 --> 01:35:49,666
- If you can't handle it, don't get drunk!
- Dude!

1781
01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:51,416
Move!

1782
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:52,958
Dude!

1783
01:35:53,041 --> 01:35:55,666
- Shohdy!
- Here you go!

1784
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:57,375
- Come here!
- Shohdy!

1785
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:00,625
Adel! Ambulance!

1786
01:36:00,708 --> 01:36:03,041
Adel, Shohdy isn't well! Shohdy!

1787
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:05,291
Ambulance!

1788
01:36:13,500 --> 01:36:15,916
Your phone, Hussein.
We want to check up on Shohdy.

1789
01:36:18,541 --> 01:36:22,000
Hussein, your phone!
We want to check up on Shohdy.

1790
01:36:22,958 --> 01:36:26,375
I must have dropped it during the fight…

1791
01:36:47,208 --> 01:36:48,541
<i>How are you, Adel?</i>

1792
01:36:49,625 --> 01:36:51,541
<i>I know that your phone is switched off.</i>

1793
01:36:52,083 --> 01:36:54,166
<i>Which is why I sent you this message.</i>

1794
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:57,125
<i>So you can listen to it whenever you want.</i>

1795
01:36:57,916 --> 01:36:59,708
<i>I just wish you picked up.</i>

1796
01:37:00,875 --> 01:37:03,541
<i>So I could tell you how happy I am.</i>

1797
01:37:03,625 --> 01:37:07,041
<i>And that I was happy with you
my whole life.</i>

1798
01:37:07,625 --> 01:37:09,541
<i>What did you do today?</i>

1799
01:37:10,416 --> 01:37:12,500
<i>Even though
I know what you're going to say.</i>

1800
01:37:12,583 --> 01:37:16,208
<i>You'll tell me, "What is there
to do in life without you here?"</i>

1801
01:37:16,750 --> 01:37:18,875
<i>There are many things in life, Adel.</i>

1802
01:37:19,958 --> 01:37:23,166
<i>There are friends and relatives.</i>

1803
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,708
<i>And all the people around you
who love you.</i>

1804
01:37:27,416 --> 01:37:29,458
<i>Who always want to see you happy.</i>

1805
01:37:31,541 --> 01:37:33,208
<i>There are the happy moments,</i>

1806
01:37:33,875 --> 01:37:35,083
<i>and the wild ones</i>

1807
01:37:35,958 --> 01:37:37,500
<i>that are priceless.</i>

1808
01:37:39,083 --> 01:37:40,833
<i>All these things,</i>

1809
01:37:41,416 --> 01:37:43,125
<i>I want you to live them.</i>

1810
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:49,000
<i>So when you come to me in heaven,
and I ask you what you did,</i>

1811
01:37:49,083 --> 01:37:51,250
<i>you won't tell me, "I didn't do anything."</i>

1812
01:37:51,833 --> 01:37:56,375
<i>Oh, yes. Adel,
don't ride the Harley without a helmet.</i>

1813
01:37:56,916 --> 01:37:59,666
<i>But not my pink helmet.</i>

1814
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:02,625
<i>Take care of yourself, my love.</i>

1815
01:38:04,833 --> 01:38:06,375
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1816
01:38:09,083 --> 01:38:10,708
<i>Goodbye, my love.</i>

1817
01:38:38,791 --> 01:38:40,000
Azaizy.

1818
01:38:43,708 --> 01:38:44,916
Azaizy.

1819
01:38:46,625 --> 01:38:47,750
Shohdy!

1820
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:50,583
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, thank God.

1821
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:53,416
Go to hell!

1822
01:38:57,541 --> 01:38:59,875
What's going on, Azaizy? Are you crying?

1823
01:39:03,833 --> 01:39:05,458
Call me Hana, since I'm crying.

1824
01:39:07,625 --> 01:39:09,041
Take care of yourself, Shohdy.

1825
01:39:09,875 --> 01:39:11,000
We're not young anymore.

1826
01:39:11,666 --> 01:39:13,750
It's all up to God, Azaizy.

1827
01:39:13,833 --> 01:39:15,041
God bless.

1828
01:39:16,333 --> 01:39:18,125
- Azaizy.
- Yes, my dear.

1829
01:39:19,541 --> 01:39:21,208
I want to confess something to you.

1830
01:39:21,958 --> 01:39:25,208
But I don't want it
to affect our relationship.

1831
01:39:27,458 --> 01:39:28,666
Take this, Azaizy.

1832
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,166
Keep this with you and take care of it.

1833
01:39:36,333 --> 01:39:37,666
This is the nail for the sofa.

1834
01:39:39,125 --> 01:39:40,333
You had it all along?

1835
01:39:41,583 --> 01:39:44,000
You let me sleep on the sofa
and break my back and neck?

1836
01:39:49,958 --> 01:39:51,541
Hold it. Don't be embarrassed.

1837
01:40:07,541 --> 01:40:09,125
What should I write in the report?

1838
01:40:09,958 --> 01:40:11,833
Should I write that two 60-year-olds

1839
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:15,708
beat up five burly men?

1840
01:40:15,791 --> 01:40:18,791
- It's not about age, sir.
- Or body.

1841
01:40:18,875 --> 01:40:22,291
It's obvious
that it's not about age or body, father.

1842
01:40:23,583 --> 01:40:27,166
Sir, there was a slight misunderstanding
that will hopefully be resolved.

1843
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:30,791
But one of our friends is in the hospital.
And we want to go check up on him.

1844
01:40:30,875 --> 01:40:33,333
What's he doing in the hospital?
It must be the fight.

1845
01:40:33,416 --> 01:40:35,750
No, sir. A heart attack.

1846
01:40:35,833 --> 01:40:38,833
There you go. These are the illnesses
that suit your age.

1847
01:40:39,916 --> 01:40:43,291
Okay. I suggest that you do
a reconciliation report.

1848
01:40:43,375 --> 01:40:45,875
No, sir! We want them
to spend the night in jail.

1849
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,708
You see, sir! He's starts it each time!

1850
01:40:48,791 --> 01:40:50,601
- I'm itchy, son. What's wrong?
- Leave him be.

1851
01:40:50,625 --> 01:40:53,500
As you like.
But that's not to your benefit.

1852
01:40:53,583 --> 01:40:55,208
You see what this guy looks like?

1853
01:40:55,291 --> 01:40:57,875
What are they gonna say?
That two old people... Pardon me...

1854
01:40:58,708 --> 01:41:00,541
Beat you up and wiped the floor with you?

1855
01:41:00,625 --> 01:41:02,208
How will you walk around the place?

1856
01:41:02,708 --> 01:41:05,833
How will you take pictures in the gym?
It's ruined.

1857
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:09,208
- Right?
- Yes.

1858
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:16,750
Shohdy, my dear. You missed it!

1859
01:41:16,833 --> 01:41:20,125
You missed your brother Hussein
beating all those kids up!

1860
01:41:20,208 --> 01:41:24,416
How about Adel?
He gave those kids a proper thrashing!

1861
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:25,833
A real boxer!

1862
01:41:25,916 --> 01:41:29,375
Not to that extent, Hussein.
We don't want to exaggerate.

1863
01:41:30,666 --> 01:41:33,500
Such confidence! Oh, Adoola.

1864
01:41:33,583 --> 01:41:35,750
How are you doing, Mr. Shohdy?
Feeling better?

1865
01:41:35,833 --> 01:41:37,250
Much better, Mahi.

1866
01:41:37,333 --> 01:41:39,291
He's a monkey, as you can see.

1867
01:41:39,375 --> 01:41:42,458
- What could possibly happen to him?
- Have some respect.

1868
01:41:42,541 --> 01:41:45,791
He was just crying his eyes out
in front of me. Should I tell them?

1869
01:41:45,875 --> 01:41:48,208
He was crying, saying,
"I'm nothing without you, Shohdy."

1870
01:41:48,291 --> 01:41:49,791
"Call me Hana."

1871
01:41:51,416 --> 01:41:53,125
The nurse is called Hana.

1872
01:41:54,125 --> 01:41:55,583
I don't know why he's crying.

1873
01:41:55,666 --> 01:41:58,375
It's only a matter of time
before he'll have to say goodbye anyway.

1874
01:41:59,375 --> 01:42:00,875
No, Adel, we…

1875
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,125
played a prank on you.

1876
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,916
I'm not going to die.
I mean, I'm not dying.

1877
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,333
Who are you playing a prank on, you fools?

1878
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:12,458
I figured you out
the minute you came to see me.

1879
01:42:12,541 --> 01:42:14,333
But I thought I would come with you.

1880
01:42:14,875 --> 01:42:16,750
Or hide, and use you to keep me warm.

1881
01:42:17,291 --> 01:42:18,958
Who am I gonna find besides you guys

1882
01:42:19,833 --> 01:42:22,041
that'll put up with my sadness
and take my worries away?

1883
01:42:22,541 --> 01:42:25,458
Who asks for mangoes
when their friend is dying?

1884
01:42:25,541 --> 01:42:27,083
What?

1885
01:42:27,166 --> 01:42:28,500
I was furious, guys.

1886
01:42:29,458 --> 01:42:31,208
- Hello.
- Hi.

1887
01:42:31,875 --> 01:42:35,416
I'm sorry you're not well, Mr. Shohdy.
I ran over when I heard what happened.

1888
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:37,291
You're a good guy, Mostafa.

1889
01:42:37,958 --> 01:42:41,083
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, Mostafa. Much better.

1890
01:42:41,958 --> 01:42:44,476
Now that you've checked on him,
why don't you let him rest for a bit?

1891
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:47,041
Yeah, get going. Let me rest.

1892
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:48,500
Mahi, I need you. Don't go.

1893
01:42:48,583 --> 01:42:50,208
I hope you feel better, Shohdy.

1894
01:42:50,291 --> 01:42:52,416
- I hope you get better, Shohdy.
- Thanks, Hussein.

1895
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:54,750
If you need anything, we're by your side.

1896
01:42:54,833 --> 01:42:56,000
Go ahead.

1897
01:42:59,125 --> 01:43:00,333
Mahi,

1898
01:43:01,833 --> 01:43:03,625
in the pocket of this jacket is a box.

1899
01:43:04,416 --> 01:43:05,916
Get it for me, please.

1900
01:43:13,541 --> 01:43:14,583
Open it.

1901
01:43:41,166 --> 01:43:42,375
Hussein.

1902
01:43:43,666 --> 01:43:45,166
Does Shohdy have hemorrhoids?

1903
01:43:45,250 --> 01:43:47,625
From a long time ago.

1904
01:43:48,333 --> 01:43:51,416
That's a shame.
I really wanted to do something for him.

1905
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,416
We all wanted to do something for him.

1906
01:44:01,791 --> 01:44:03,541
Congratulations, Mostafa.

1907
01:44:03,625 --> 01:44:05,250
Thank you, Mr. Shohdy.

1908
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:07,166
Thank you very much, Mr. Shohdy.

1909
01:44:07,666 --> 01:44:10,166
Thank you for this huge gift.

1910
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:13,000
It's true. There was no need for it.
It's too much!

1911
01:44:13,083 --> 01:44:14,916
What are you thanking me for?
It's nothing.

1912
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,833
It will be deducted from your salary.

1913
01:44:17,333 --> 01:44:20,142
What do you mean? I won't pay this off
even if I worked for my entire life.

1914
01:44:20,166 --> 01:44:22,750
- It's fine, Mostafa.
- Take it off. We don't accept gifts.

1915
01:44:22,833 --> 01:44:25,750
Deduct it from my salary, Mr. Shohdy.
It's no problem.

1916
01:44:25,833 --> 01:44:27,125
That's fine, then.

1917
01:44:27,208 --> 01:44:30,168
Why are you looking at me like that?
She's going to wear it. Why my salary?

1918
01:44:30,250 --> 01:44:33,125
You're a very sweet couple.
What a disgrace!

1919
01:44:33,791 --> 01:44:38,291
Before I let you go,
I have a quick question.

1920
01:44:38,375 --> 01:44:42,041
Does that silver thing over there
belong to the bride or the groom?

1921
01:44:42,958 --> 01:44:44,458
She's my uncle's wife.

1922
01:44:44,541 --> 01:44:46,017
- Your uncle's wife…
- May God bless his soul.

1923
01:44:46,041 --> 01:44:49,583
May God bless his soul?
You should have said!

1924
01:44:49,666 --> 01:44:52,083
- This is very delightful!
- Mr. Shohdy!

1925
01:44:52,166 --> 01:44:55,125
- Mr. Shohdy!
- Just leave him. He won't come back.

1926
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:19,875
The last hotel I stayed at served pasta
for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

1927
01:45:19,958 --> 01:45:22,916
- Even Saleh, my assistant...
- You told me this story before.

1928
01:45:24,083 --> 01:45:26,750
You don't like it when I'm quiet
or when I talk?

1929
01:45:26,833 --> 01:45:30,000
No. I like you when you're talking
and when you're quiet.

1930
01:45:30,083 --> 01:45:32,166
But you can only talk
when I tell you to talk.

1931
01:45:32,750 --> 01:45:33,750
Can I talk now?

1932
01:45:35,458 --> 01:45:36,541
No.

1933
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,333
They're lovely!

1934
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:46,250
- Hussein.
- Yes?

1935
01:45:46,333 --> 01:45:48,083
Why don't we get up and dance like them?

1936
01:45:48,166 --> 01:45:50,708
Have some respect! Don't say that.

1937
01:45:50,791 --> 01:45:52,291
Why? Am I not desirable?

1938
01:45:54,416 --> 01:45:56,333
Just clap. Desirable?

1939
01:45:56,416 --> 01:45:58,000
Of course you're desirable, my love.

1940
01:45:58,083 --> 01:46:01,958
I meant, dancing here is by appointment.
We'd have to have come two days earlier

1941
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:04,833
and dance to the right
and left of the bride.

1942
01:46:04,916 --> 01:46:06,875
And then choose the position we like.

1943
01:46:07,458 --> 01:46:09,958
Did you know
Hussein wanted to bring his cousins too?

1944
01:46:10,041 --> 01:46:11,250
What's up? What did I miss?

1945
01:46:11,333 --> 01:46:13,791
- Where have you been?
- I was getting the surprise ready.

1946
01:46:13,875 --> 01:46:15,750
- Have you done it?
- Of course.

1947
01:46:15,833 --> 01:46:19,166
I'm going to make this wedding light up!
You'll see! Look!

1948
01:52:37,916 --> 01:52:39,916
