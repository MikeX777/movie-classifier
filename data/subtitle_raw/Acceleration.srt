1
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,859
Let's do this.

2
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,414
Let's see what we got here.

3
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,006
The fuck is this?

4
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:43,703
In this business, there
is no room for mistakes.

5
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,539
Any wrong turn,

6
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,626
and innocent people
can pay the price.

7
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:53,337
These streets and five tasks

8
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,206
stand between me
and seeing my son again.

9
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:59,678
Get the money and find
the guns, or I'm a dead man.

10
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,966
We're on it, Jimmie.

11
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,966
Hey, you! Stop!

12
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,712
David?

13
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,797
We still good to meet?

14
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,666
I can't talk right now.

15
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,134
I'm, um...

16
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,799
I'm busy.

17
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,593
I'll meet you at our spot.

18
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,043
Rhona.

19
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,551
Can I get you anything?

20
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,975
Water, coffee, and privacy.

21
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,142
Sure thing.

22
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,777
She's, uh...
she's not eating?

23
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,614
No, she's just
taking up a table.

24
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,246
Anything else?

25
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,245
Privacy.

26
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,666
That'll be 3.50.

27
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,254
I was never here.

28
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,097
Refills on me.

29
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,566
Enjoying your coffee?

30
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,536
I wanna speak to my son.

31
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,875
Not the agreement.

32
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,961
We made an agreement?

33
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,795
Complete all your assignments,
you not only

34
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,791
get to speak to him, you'll have
the pleasure of holding him.

35
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,167
How do I know...

36
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,680
How do I know you
haven't already killed him?

37
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,720
You don't.

38
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:00,766
Fuck.
This place is dangerous.

39
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,014
Buck up.

40
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,810
Where the hell is Richie?

41
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,438
Well, Richie is...

42
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,862
Richie's late,
but he'll be here.

43
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:18,659
If you two fuck this up,
this won't end well.

44
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,078
Understood?

45
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,792
Yeah.
Yeah, I understand.

46
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,334
Good.

47
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,844
I need this money
to get Mika out of here.

48
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,963
You must love your son.

49
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,967
Yeah, I do.
Imagine that.

50
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,844
There's Richie right there.

51
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,938
Told you.

52
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,145
Stay in the fucking car.

53
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,320
I'm serious, not a sound.

54
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,864
Richie, you're late.

55
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,039
Let's do this.

56
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,687
He wants to see the money.

57
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,931
Let's see the product first.

58
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,696
What's wrong with you?
Are you high?

59
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,288
No!

60
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,702
Let's do this.

61
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,329
Just show it to him, okay?

62
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,715
Look, just... just get the bag
and show him the money.

63
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,087
Richie!

64
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,133
Tell him to get on the ground!

65
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,509
What the hell is happening?

66
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,886
Wait, what the hell
are you doing?

67
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:05,813
Get on the ground!

68
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:06,814
No, what are you...

69
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,110
I know you said
you weren't here,

70
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,609
but, uh, the coffee cup is.

71
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:24,614
I'll probably regret asking
this, but are you all right?

72
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,583
Allergies.

73
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:31,579
I don't know their names,
but they're not worth it.

74
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,082
You'd best go it alone, they
give you any difficulty at all.

75
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,803
They won't see
the next sunrise.

76
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,306
Evening, Betty.

77
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,975
Well, it's a quiet one
at that, isn't it?

78
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,725
Your powers of observation
are astounding.

79
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,317
How's the yellow-white
pie tonight, it's good?

80
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,107
Yeah, the lemon
meringue's fresh.

81
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,982
Good. Gimme a slice?

82
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,030
Actually, Betty,
make it two, will ya?

83
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,951
Kane.

84
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,753
That's your car out front.
Am I right?

85
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,625
It is tonight.

86
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,218
Here you go.

87
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:23,510
Oh, Betty, you're a queen.

88
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,803
Beautiful, thank you, sweetie.
- Thank you.

89
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,767
You're gonna love this.

90
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,979
This... this is another level.

91
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,646
That's beautiful.

92
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,986
You know, it always tastes
exactly the same, too.

93
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,944
They call that "integrity."

94
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,661
It's like the recipe never
wavers, not once, you know?

95
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,325
It's always the same.

96
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:50,200
It's the culinary equivalent
of loyalty, I guess.

97
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,169
It's like all
the ingredients

98
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,130
show up every single time
they're called,

99
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,374
in exactly the right amounts.

100
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:03,755
That's what makes it
so pure and perfect.

101
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,222
You know what I mean?

102
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,466
It's beautiful, right?

103
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,554
What's the matter, Rhona,
you don't... you don't eat pie?

104
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:15,023
You know, if you don't take it,
somebody will.

105
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,438
Mm.

106
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,903
Not even a taste, huh?

107
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,488
Tiny little taste,
tip of your tongue?

108
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,284
Later.

109
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,700
Well, then, you won't mind
if I take it, will ya?

110
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:32,825
Betty, can we get this,
uh, to go, sweetie?

111
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,451
- Okay.
- Thank you, darlin'.

112
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,548
You know what I could do
for you... and I'd be willing...

113
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,758
I can swing by your place
and deliver that pie to you,

114
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,847
any way you want it.

115
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,431
Mm.

116
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,426
Wherever
you want it delivered,

117
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,180
however many times
you want it delivered.

118
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,645
That's all right, thank you.

119
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,188
You wouldn't wanna
wreck that beautiful chassis

120
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,278
of yours, would you?

121
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,943
I don't imagine
that delicious ass

122
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,613
got that way by eating pie,
am I right?

123
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,111
You know what I like best
about you, Rhona?

124
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,865
You never once
asked me to cuddle.

125
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,993
It was just straight to business
with you, all business, all day.

126
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,792
And I fucking respect that.

127
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,881
I don't like to cuddle.

128
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,374
- Of course not.
- Here you go.

129
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,594
Thank you, Betty.
You're a queen, darlin'.

130
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:29,306
Listen to me, I want you to be
careful out there, all right?

131
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,175
There's a lot of machine
under your right foot.

132
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,928
Don't get too heavy on it.
- Mm.

133
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,226
You don't want the back end
stepping out, opposite lock.

134
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,397
That's where
the danger happens, right?

135
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:41,814
Thank you.

136
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,108
Mm. You be good, huh?

137
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,271
Either one of you boys
seen this guy?

138
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,684
I'm fine, how are you?

139
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,894
I don't care much how you are.

140
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,987
Have you seen him or not?

141
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,655
It's polite to say,
"Excuse me, can you help me?"

142
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,454
He's putting his phone away.

143
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,119
What are you gonna do,
try something?

144
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:41,003
Get outta here, man.
There's nothing here for you.

145
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,346
Who you looking for?

146
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,556
This guy.
You know him?

147
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,390
Oh, Richie.
I know that guy.

148
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,056
He hangs out with
this other guy named Dominic.

149
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,679
Usually they're at the diner
this time of night.

150
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,396
Thank you very much.

151
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,187
Oh... sorry about the mess.

152
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,107
Oh, shit!

153
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,485
Hey!

154
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,782
Hey... hey, hey,
hey, hey, lady, lady.

155
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:18,123
I'm just looking
for a few extra bucks.

156
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,242
You got something?

157
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,484
What?

158
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,986
Do you think you can
alter the rules?

159
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,828
Is that what I think?

160
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,790
Don't at any time believe
you have control

161
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,830
of the situation, ever.

162
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,079
I just stopped
for a cup of coffee.

163
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,518
You have four
more envelopes,

164
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:05,811
five hours, 21 minutes,
and nine seconds to work with.

165
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,204
Dominic, Dominic, Dominic.

166
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,496
How you doing, buddy?

167
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,369
Pretty good?
- Yeah.

168
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,748
- Look at that.
- Yeah, how you been?

169
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,750
I been good. You?

170
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,173
- Yeah, okay.
- Have a seat.

171
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,763
Hey, I'm all right.

172
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,766
Yeah?

173
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:45,058
Just talk to me.
What have you been up to?

174
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,396
I ain't been doing nothing.

175
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,605
Do not lie, Dominic.

176
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,568
You know, it's only
gonna be worse for you.

177
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,655
Dominic, Dominic.

178
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,569
This must be some
mistaken situation,

179
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:57,987
because I ain't
been doing nothing.

180
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,735
I swear, Kane, nothing.

181
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:04,365
So you, uh... you... you're
saying I make mistakes?

182
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,411
That what you're saying?

183
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,250
I ain't saying that, I...

184
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,415
You just fucking said it.
You said I make mistakes.

185
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,913
That's what you said.

186
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,414
Well, I didn't
mean to say that.

187
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,757
No disrespect, Kane. I'm just...

188
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,252
Where can I find
Richie, Dominic?

189
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,755
- Richie?
- Richie, your boy.

190
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,757
Oh, you hang out
with Richie, swap needles.

191
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,349
I don't know, maybe you touch
fucking dongs, I don't know.

192
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,934
Where the fuck
can I find Richie?

193
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,020
Where can I find him?
- Oh, Richie.

194
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,559
- Oh, oh, oh...
- Richie.

195
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,647
- Richie.
- Oh, yeah, Richie, oh...

196
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,357
Yeah, fucking Richie, eh?

197
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,443
Richie, I... I mean, I haven't
seen Richie in a while.

198
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:36,905
What's "a while?"
What exactly is a while?

199
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,024
Is that, like... is that
like a week, a...

200
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,617
a month, a fucking millennia?

201
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,656
What's a... what... what...
what's... what's a while?

202
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,369
I don't know, Kane.

203
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:47,833
I don't know,
maybe four days?

204
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,371
Four days!

205
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,119
We're gonna go with
four days for a while.

206
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,371
I like that. I'm gonna go with
four days for a while.

207
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,168
Okay. -
So four days ago,

208
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:58,010
where'd you see Rchie, exactly?

209
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:01,176
Maybe the... the track, or...

210
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:03,549
or the laundromat, the diner.

211
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,551
You know, around, around,
like you do, yeah.

212
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,722
Around.
Around, yeah, yeah.

213
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,688
I'm gonna need a drink...
a round.

214
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,402
You know what we're gonna do?

215
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,861
We're gonna play a game.

216
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,480
You think we should
do the cigar box?

217
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,234
Yeah, grab me the cigar box.
You like games?

218
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,825
Yeah.

219
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,320
You're gonna love this.
Look at this.

220
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,822
So you and I...

221
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,370
We're gonna do a little
bang-bang, okay?

222
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:32,666
You go three clicks,
and I go three clicks.

223
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,958
You do three clicks,

224
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,546
you fucking walk
outta here, right?

225
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:39,338
I mean, unless
I fucking blow my brains out.

226
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,928
Sound good to you, Dominic?

227
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,594
Look, Kane...

228
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,513
I swear to you
I ain't seen Richie, okay?

229
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,140
Now, I ain't been doing nothing,
and I don't wanna do this.

230
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,562
You know what, you know what,
Dominic, okay,

231
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,400
I'm gonna give you
a choice here.

232
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,191
You can play the game with me,

233
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,814
or you could tell me where
the fuck I can find Richie.

234
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,282
I don't know where Richie is.

235
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,946
Or you can do a dance
with my boy here.

236
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,570
But unfortunately, he's probably
not gonna let you leave,

237
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,822
and he loves
to fucking grab ass.

238
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,793
Kane, don't make me
do this, man.

239
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,412
You gotta believe me,
I'm telling you.

240
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,130
What's it gonna be, Dom?

241
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,669
I don't know where Richie is.

242
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,763
Don't make me do this.
Don't make me do this.

243
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,757
Oh, Dom, I swear to god
I thought...

244
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,929
Fuck you, Kane! Fuck you!

245
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,472
I fucking believe you.
I still believe you.

246
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,563
Dom, I believe you.
Dom, I believe you.

247
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,773
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

248
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:38,143
Hey, hey... I believe you, buddy.

249
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,612
I believe you, buddy.

250
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,230
I believe you're gonna do it.

251
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,824
You did, you pulled
that trigger, didn't you?

252
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,318
Fucking Dominic
pulled that trigger.

253
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,115
Have a seat.

254
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,035
Have a seat.
Sit down.

255
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,704
Look at me.
Look at me, look at me.

256
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,668
You think I'm fucking stupid?
- Oh!

257
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,583
Pick your fucking head up
and look at me.

258
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,755
Pick your fucking head up!
Dom, look at me!

259
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,219
This is when the game
starts... right now.

260
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,928
But here's the good news.

261
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,388
That's one.

262
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,599
Now it's my turn. Okay?

263
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,094
It's my turn.
You ready for this?

264
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,017
It's my turn.
Are you ready?

265
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,311
Look at me.
Open your eyes, Dom!

266
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,560
Don't you fucking
take your eyes off of me.

267
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,108
Look at me! Dom!
Goddamn it...

268
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,821
No, I can't.
...you fucking open your eyes.

269
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,190
- No! No!
- Look! Look!

270
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,318
You wanna see this,
motherfucker.

271
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,569
- No!
- You wanna see it? Ah!

272
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,657
You're up.

273
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,783
Two more clicks, and you walk.

274
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,501
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

275
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:37,995
- I can't!
- Look at me, Dom.

276
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,712
You know what I'm gonna do?
- I can't do it.

277
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,707
Would you help him?
Give him air, help him out.

278
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,299
My girl is gonna
help you out, Dom.

279
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,214
- I can't.
- It's okay, it's okay.

280
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,632
I can't.

281
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,966
It's gonna be all right.

282
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,554
Atta boy.

283
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,226
I don't want to.

284
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,690
Maybe nobody believed
in you when you were a kid.

285
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,150
I fucking believe in you, Dom.

286
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,941
You can do this.
I believe in you, buddy.

287
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,235
You're not a fucking... are
you a fucking pussy?

288
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,029
Not the Dom I know!

289
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,200
I believe in you, buddy.
Dom, pull it.

290
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,289
Pull it, motherfucker.

291
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,248
Do it. Do it.

292
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,414
Fucking do it, Dom.
Pull it!

293
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,663
Oh, fucking shit!

294
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,417
Is that blood on my pool table?

295
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,669
Wipe that shit off, would you?
I don't give a fuck.

296
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,842
I don't want fucking
loser DNA in my house.

297
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,402
Are you going
to let me go now?

298
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:49,900
Soon.

299
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,527
Why are you doing this?

300
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,949
I have no choice.

301
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:56,699
My mother says
we always have a choice.

302
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:01,370
Did she also tell you you have
to live with the consequences?

303
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,996
Yeah.

304
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,043
A couple of years,
this will be a story

305
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,711
you'll tell your friends.

306
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,005
Eat your sandwich.
You'll see your mom soon.

307
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,699
Bullshit.

308
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,248
No, I'm not... I'm not doing this.

309
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,417
Fuck you.

310
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,837
Did you hear me?
Fuck you.

311
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,649
Fucking asshole!

312
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,885
The kid's not here, Rhona.

313
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,472
You know I still have to look.

314
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,645
And you know
I can't just let you do that.

315
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:51,237
That would be a real shame.

316
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,276
Tell you what.

317
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,866
I'm gonna go take a smoke break.

318
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,532
I'm gonna be back

319
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:02,158
in 10 minutes exactly.

320
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,658
Cigarettes are bad for you.

321
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,628
Yeah. So is life.

322
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,210
Hey.

323
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,799
I hope you find him.

324
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,518
Hey.

325
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,682
Your kid ain't here.

326
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,975
Then where?

327
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,769
Even if I knew,
I couldn't say.

328
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,482
Look, you're going
about this all wrong.

329
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,650
I am not your enemy.

330
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,194
Everyone is the enemy tonight.

331
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,942
I understand that,
but nothing positive

332
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,784
will come from you aiming
your weapon at me.

333
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:24,407
- I'm willing to find out.
- Well, I'd prefer we didn't.

334
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,703
So if you will...

335
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,332
Very kind of you.

336
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:36,552
Hey, despite what you may
believe, we have a code.

337
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:40,422
Family is strictly off-limits.

338
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,266
Vladik crossed that line,
and he will be dealt with.

339
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,634
Doubtful.

340
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:47,012
I assure you, he will be.

341
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,605
I know you have mutual
business with Vladik.

342
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,851
Hey, hey, that ain't
none of your business.

343
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,397
You lie.

344
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,772
We've known one another
for a very long time.

345
00:26:57,783 --> 00:26:59,615
Don't play me.

346
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,450
I would never do such a thing.

347
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,945
Do you know
where my son is or not?

348
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,322
I truly don't.

349
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,702
And if you knew...

350
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,003
would you tell me?

351
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,793
That would be a question.

352
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,712
That is the question.

353
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,926
Like I said.

354
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:22,593
If anything happens
to Mika, if he dies...

355
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,309
I know, I know:
you'll come for me.

356
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,472
Go in peace.

357
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:28,973
What is it?

358
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,059
You won't find answers
in our safehouses.

359
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,098
I suggest you use
your time wisely.

360
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,142
Well, I want proof of life.

361
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,391
Do the job and
you get your son back.

362
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,184
Au revoir.

363
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,615
Yeah, okay,
I'll take care of it.

364
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,459
Yes, I got her.

365
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,181
Let me speak to my son.

366
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,850
Must we have this conversation
every time we speak?

367
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,348
What, am I being annoying, hm?

368
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:50,193
Because I want
to talk to my son?

369
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,312
Perhaps after your next
assignment,

370
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:55,531
as a sign of good faith I'll
give you a moment with Mika.

371
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:59,027
This is all just
a game to you, isn't it?

372
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,370
3:31 a.m.

373
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:04,832
Look...

374
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,596
You got enough to eat?

375
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,182
Why are you worried
about my diet?

376
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,596
I'm not worried.

377
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,969
I just wanna make
sure you get fed.

378
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,189
Does he talk?

379
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,399
- Ask him.
- Do you talk?

380
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,027
I guess not.

381
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,396
He's a thinker.

382
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,739
Where's my mom?

383
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,903
She's running
an errand for me.

384
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,742
What kind of errand?

385
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,078
Nothing for you
to be concerned about.

386
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,539
Why? Because it's illegal?

387
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,158
What makes
you think it's illegal?

388
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:51,333
I'm pretty sure you guys
don't have normal jobs.

389
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,830
We work all the same.

390
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:55,584
It's just our hours
are a little different.

391
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,551
Then why does he have a gun?

392
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,633
It's for your safety.

393
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,303
That's something
a cop would say.

394
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,097
You got a problem with cops?

395
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,935
I guess they're okay.

396
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,352
My mom says to never
trust a cop or a lawyer.

397
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,942
Says they're always looking
for ways to take you down.

398
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,608
Well, you can add
priests to that list, too.

399
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,607
And car salesmen.

400
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,700
Just... just
get some rest, okay?

401
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,614
You really don't talk?

402
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,963
Jimmie.

403
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,336
We were wondering
when you'd surface.

404
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,713
Where are the guns?

405
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:44,807
I, uh... I didn't know
what to do, man.

406
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,142
You were supposed
to hijack Vladik's shipment,

407
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,853
and yet, no guns.

408
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,769
Listen, I gotta
speak with Kane.

409
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,940
I know he's back there,
so sh-sh-sh-shush.

410
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,652
Outta my way,
I'm not afraid of you.

411
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,272
Jimmie, why would
you say that?

412
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,194
That's a good question,
and I'm glad you asked.

413
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:05,411
Because you don't control me
when I'm holding a gun.

414
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,949
What are you gonna
do with it, Jimmie?

415
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:10,825
Whatever I want, man.
Whatever I need to do.

416
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,451
Whoa, hey!

417
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:14,749
Okay, well, let's
put our guns down, Jimmie,

418
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,463
and we can talk about it.

419
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,842
Yeah, let's talk about this.

420
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:24,338
You hang out while I'm boots
on the ground slaving,

421
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,217
earning, so that Kane

422
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,514
can have all this...

423
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,683
this fancy shit.

424
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:35,775
This, right here.
This fancy... huh?

425
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,268
You shouldn't do that, Jimmie.

426
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,941
Why don't you back up?

427
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,314
Okay, Jimmie.

428
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,565
Why you keep
saying my name, man?

429
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,237
Stop saying my fucking name.

430
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,610
Why, Jimmie?

431
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,282
You don't like
your name, Jimmie?

432
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:51,123
It's messing with my head.
I don't like that.

433
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,708
I understand.

434
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,873
Oh, you understand, Hannibal?

435
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,793
You're one of those
understanding...

436
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:04,545
Hah!

437
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,718
The Russian, he was fucking...
he was stalling, man.

438
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:10,139
And the whole deal,
it went sideways.

439
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,102
I didn't know it
would go down like this.

440
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,721
I mean, I like you,
and I don't wanna have

441
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,270
to shoot you in your
fucking pretty face.

442
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:18,438
I need to speak with Kane,

443
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:21,279
because I just...
I just need him to know.

444
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,647
I just...

445
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,947
Shit.

446
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:21,380
Hey, Rhona.

447
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,339
Tony. How's it going?

448
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:24,675
Good.

449
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,385
This a social visit?

450
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,970
Up to her.

451
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,716
All right.
I'll follow you.

452
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:48,070
I see you, a gun,

453
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,864
a late-night visit,

454
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,159
and I assume,
with you, problems.

455
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,781
Too many to count.

456
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,000
Why are you here?

457
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,710
The cash.

458
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,672
I made a cash deal
to keep the peace,

459
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:07,965
and now he sends you
to what, take it back?

460
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,764
I'm asking, please.

461
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,807
Then why the gun?

462
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,807
Doesn't seem to me like asking.

463
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,017
Insurance.

464
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,860
Well, insurance has a price.

465
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,150
I keep the cash.

466
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,495
Now, off you go.

467
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:47,166
She'll be back.

468
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,730
Take care.

469
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:31,256
- Yeah?
- It's me.

470
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,674
What's up?

471
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,801
We found Richie.

472
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,929
He's pushing snow
to Santos' men tonight.

473
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,273
Grab Hannibal and the boys,
and go fetch him, huh?

474
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,437
Alive.

475
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,401
That'd be up to him

476
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,646
A-live.

477
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,952
He said he wants
to see us at 4:00 p.m.

478
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,663
Is that good?
- Let's do 5:00. It's too early.

479
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,907
No, I don't wanna do 5:00,
so we'll do 7:00 p.m.

480
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:02,408
7:00 p.m.'s fine.

481
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,250
Do you wanna just go
right now instead?

482
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,960
No, I don't wanna do
right now. We'll do 9:00 p.m.

483
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,796
9:00 p.m. it is, works for me.
I'll do 9:00 p.m.

484
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,586
Richie? Richie?

485
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:11,635
Richie.
- What?

486
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,093
Company.

487
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,760
Oh, hey, fellas.

488
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,057
What a surprise.

489
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,181
For you, or for us, Richie?

490
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:29,026
I was, uh, coincidentally,
uh, just...

491
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,815
just thinking about you guys.

492
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,064
Sure you were.

493
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,656
It's time to take a ride.

494
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,400
Oh, you know, I appreciate it,

495
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,198
but, uh, look, I got
a lotta work to do here.

496
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,787
So I'm... I'll catch up
with you guys later, hm?

497
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,497
It's not an invitation.

498
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,662
Wait, no, hold on.

499
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,080
Guys, guys.

500
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,981
We've got company,
Santos' men.

501
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:16,323
No, no!
Let me go!

502
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,157
My son.

503
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:09,080
We've been through this,
you know the rules.

504
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:12,251
Take out each target associated
with the numbered envelope.

505
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,122
Acquire my items,
put the items in the bag.

506
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,967
Then, and only then,
will you see your son.

507
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,460
I mean, what part
of this doesn't register

508
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:19,928
in your grey matter?

509
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:22,765
I want to speak
with my child, now.

510
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:24,554
You wanna speak to your child?

511
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,677
Yes.

512
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:29,145
Start by giving me fire.

513
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:32,858
I want to speak
with Mika, that's all.

514
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,021
You heard me.

515
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:37,938
Fuck.

516
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,251
This is Ling's.

517
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:54,964
- Order for delivery.
- Go ahead.

518
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:59,256
Number 11, with two fortune
cookies.

519
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:00,969
And a hot tea.

520
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:03,305
Any pie to go with that?

521
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,094
No.

522
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,763
We'll be there soon.

523
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,478
What is it?

524
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,481
Use your time wisely.
You've barely begun.

525
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,325
It's getting late.
Tick-tock.

526
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,018
Hello, Santos.

527
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:06,952
And to what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

528
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,911
I want you
to give me the drive.

529
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:11,453
Hah.

530
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:14,452
This should get interesting.
And why would I do that?

531
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:17,375
Because it's
in everyone's best interest.

532
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,497
Everyone's?

533
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:21,879
Yours.

534
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,717
Not my best angle.

535
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,844
And not my choice.

536
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,397
Whose, then?

537
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,061
You know.

538
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,184
Yes, I do.

539
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,896
The easy way would be best.

540
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,023
For you.

541
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:45,524
For everyone.

542
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,785
Yeah, perhaps, perhaps not.

543
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,409
You and I go back a long way.

544
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,910
Yeah, we do.

545
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:59,379
- Eighteen years.
- Sixteen.

546
00:46:00,675 --> 00:46:02,632
Are you correcting me?

547
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:04,592
Reminding you.

548
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,757
Hm.

549
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,257
Word has it you're on a quest.

550
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:11,975
I'd rather not be.

551
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:15,392
You know,
quests can be life-changing.

552
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:18,061
This could be life-ending.

553
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,434
We don't want that,
now, do we?

554
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,527
No, we don't.

555
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,898
And, uh, you think
I can help you?

556
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,865
I could just take it.

557
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:33,447
Honest... that's what
I've always liked about you.

558
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,746
I don't have time to play.

559
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:39,039
Flaco.

560
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:48,295
You and I have
never had a problem.

561
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,298
Not yet, we haven't.

562
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:54,643
You always kept things
on a professional level,

563
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,137
never personal.

564
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,231
When I could.

565
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,021
You did it right.

566
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:05,442
That's what people remember:
that you can be relied on.

567
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:18,163
I'm not here for you.

568
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,580
That's good to hear.

569
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:20,587
You know...

570
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,414
I made copies.

571
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:25,961
I know.

572
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,005
You know, you could
have just taken me out.

573
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:30,345
Sixteen years.

574
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,723
I can just finish her off.

575
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,143
Nah.

576
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:42,357
Sixteen years.

577
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,476
Hm.

578
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,747
Rain. Chiko.

579
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:09,001
How was the pie with Kane?

580
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:12,004
I try to avoid sugar.

581
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:15,178
Number 11,
just as you requested.

582
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,223
Happy?
- Always.

583
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,768
All right, let's do this.

584
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,265
All right.

585
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,400
So, how's it fit?

586
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:35,243
Like a prom dress.

587
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:42,038
You got the guns.
Take this as a receipt.

588
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,205
Good luck, Rhona.

589
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:03,680
Ah!

590
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,286
Well done.

591
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,105
Where's Mika?

592
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,100
Oh, how should I know?

593
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:55,394
Last chance.

594
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,752
Oh...

595
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,928
Oh.

596
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,148
You took a round.

597
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,983
More than you can say.

598
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,194
You should never take a round.

599
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:39,779
I trained you better than that.

600
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,774
It's getting late.

601
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:28,449
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bacey.

602
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:36,836
Where are my guns, Richie?
Where they at?

603
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,580
Hey, buddy.

604
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,350
You don't think
I'd forget about you, do you?

605
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,840
Richie, stay with us.

606
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,512
Now, see, I know you
had a meeting

607
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:52,386
with Jack the Flower, right?

608
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:53,728
What'd you talk to Jack about?

609
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,347
What are you talking about?

610
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,144
I don't... I never met with Jack,
not even one time.

611
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:58,437
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

612
00:53:58,444 --> 00:53:59,525
- Not one?
- I'm telling the truth.

613
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:01,235
I wouldn't lie to you, man.

614
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,945
Yeah, you wouldn't...
you wouldn't fucking lie to me.

615
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,189
I'm telling the truth.
I would't lie to you, man.

616
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,690
Yeah.

617
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:07,283
I might be crazy,
but I'm not stupid.

618
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:08,202
Not at all?
Not even a little fucking lie?

619
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:09,410
No! No.

620
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,700
All right.
Show him, huh?

621
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,917
Now see, Richie,
do you really think

622
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,455
you could do something like
that and get away with it?

623
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:19,329
I don't know when that...

624
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,171
You really think you could
pull off something like that,

625
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,586
and me not find out about it?

626
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,425
I don't know...
I don't know when that...

627
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:26,841
I don't know when that was.
I... I don't know when that...

628
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:27,928
You don't know what
I'm talking about?

629
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,172
- No.
- Not at all?

630
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:30,183
No.

631
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,808
Give him one.

632
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,939
Oh, shit!

633
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,854
Richie, Richie!

634
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:42,602
You know now, buddy?
- Yeah, I do.

635
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:44,070
- You know now?
- I do, I do, yes.

636
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,404
Huh? You know what
I'm talking about?

637
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,364
Yes, yes.
I ran into him at a bar.

638
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,733
I just ran into him at a bar.

639
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,155
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

640
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:51,619
So you don't
know nothing, huh?

641
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:52,863
I don't know anything.

642
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,205
If I don't know anything,

643
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,824
how could I tell
him anything, right?

644
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:58,952
I gotcha. So, ignorance,
that's your defense?

645
00:54:58,962 --> 00:54:59,962
Yeah.

646
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:03,923
It really was just
happenstance, wasn't it?

647
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:05,417
Yeah, yeah.

648
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,214
It was just...
it was just dumb luck.

649
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:10,635
Fucking dumb luck, which
is really fucking dumb luck.

650
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,758
- Really...
- Like, so fucking dumb.

651
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:14,976
Oh, fuck.
- Really bad.

652
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,766
Richie, I got... here's
the only question I have.

653
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:19,685
What the... what the fuck
do I do with you?

654
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:20,727
I'll do anything
for you, Kane.

655
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,270
Anything you need.

656
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,314
Because I'm feeling
fucking magnanimous.

657
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,812
Magnanimous.

658
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:28,156
Generous, Richie.
Fuck, keep up.

659
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,649
- Oh... okay.
- Really generous, like...

660
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:32,323
You'll let me go, then?

661
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,570
Yeah.

662
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:37,456
Yeah, Richie.

663
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:39,834
I can do that, buddy.

664
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:44,835
I guess I just need you
to do me one favor.

665
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,209
Anything. Anything, Kane.

666
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:50,007
- Yeah?
- Anything.

667
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,754
Don't beg.

668
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,007
- What?
- That shit fucking disgusts me.

669
00:55:56,687 --> 00:55:59,179
Where you going?
Where you going?

670
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,430
Where you going?

671
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:36,637
- Why are you here?
- Please, can you help us?

672
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,555
- Shh!
- Can you help us?

673
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:41,270
Shit! Shit, shit, shit.

674
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:43,890
Here... have you seen this boy?
Look.

675
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,517
- Yes, yes.
- What?

676
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,610
- Yes, I have.
- When? Where?

677
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:51,232
Yesterday, in the office.

678
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,073
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

679
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,192
Shh.

680
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,784
Hold on.

681
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:59,531
This will do. Okay.

682
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:04,543
Be quiet.

683
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:13,549
Go, go, go, go!

684
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,171
Wait, wait, wait.

685
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,673
Here, take this.

686
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,764
- No, no, no.
- Yes!

687
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,225
Split it up and get outta here.

688
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,593
There's a door right there,
you... you...

689
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:21,845
Get outside, and you run.

690
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,596
- Thank you.
- Go! Go!

691
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,972
Oh!

692
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,393
Apologies for the tardiness,
but, uh, I did bring pie.

693
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,947
So tell me, how's
that reimbursement program

694
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,994
coming along, good?

695
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,913
I'm working on it.

696
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,253
You're working on it, huh?

697
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:56,465
Like, uh, in the practical,
or more like the abstract?

698
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:59,927
- Reality.
- Reality.

699
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,421
Yeah, because, see,
my reality is I don't get

700
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,172
my money by 7:00 a.m.,

701
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:04,845
I'm planning
a poor man's funeral.

702
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:09,102
You know what
a poor man's funeral is?

703
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:11,143
Yeah, I got my suspicions.

704
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,516
It's your funeral.

705
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,393
I mean, don't get me wrong.

706
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,190
I mean, still gonna have some
bells and whistles for you.

707
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:18,779
You know, crying hookers,
shit like that.

708
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:20,899
But it's yours.

709
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:25,578
So, you know,
word on the street

710
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,742
is you got Rhona making
laundry runs for you.

711
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:29,240
That right?

712
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:32,119
Couple items needed
cleaning up, yeah.

713
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:33,165
Oh.

714
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:40,127
So be honest with me.

715
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:42,049
That why you took the kid?

716
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,388
Some people need more
motivating than others.

717
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:45,391
Right.

718
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:48,301
I don't imagine
she's gonna be doing

719
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:51,224
any laundry stops at my place.
Am I right?

720
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:53,689
Not unless you
spill your milk.

721
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:55,149
See, now you got me curious.

722
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,812
Because I usually
never spill milk.

723
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,280
I'm sure.

724
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:06,528
Well, I guess
it's that time, right?

725
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:09,246
Bring him out.
- Ricky.

726
01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:19,416
Hey, take it easy on him.

727
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,133
What, are you
going soft on me?

728
01:01:21,136 --> 01:01:23,173
Come on, it's like you
said on the phone,

729
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,718
this is just an insurance
policy, nothing more.

730
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:27,886
Just a kid.

731
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:30,761
He's gonna be safe
like he's in his mama's arms,

732
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:34,184
sucking on that
nice, perky tit.

733
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,272
Isn't that right?

734
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:41,358
Well, I appreciate
the hospitality.

735
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:42,855
Any time.

736
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:45,233
Any time?

737
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,030
Any time?

738
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,279
I come here any time
I want, right?

739
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:51,076
Holy shit.

740
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:54,120
Don't forget,
I paid for this shit.

741
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,432
Look at that.
Nothing.

742
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:14,849
Just like I thought.

743
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:18,015
7:00 a.m.

744
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:33,326
Hello, Rhona.

745
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:37,369
This look actually suits you.

746
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:45,172
You interfere in my business.

747
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:48,012
You free my product.

748
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:49,471
You affect my income.

749
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,931
I take exception on this.

750
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:05,522
It was you that hijacked
Vladik's deal, wasn't it?

751
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:08,858
The gun deal, am I right?

752
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,031
Well, it had to be.

753
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,825
It couldn't be
that imbecile, Richie.

754
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:16,449
He can't even find his shoes
when they're on his feet.

755
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,291
That was you.

756
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:22,084
Just give me the ledger,
and we'll all go home tonight.

757
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,626
Just give you the ledger.

758
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,499
Sure, I'll just,
I'll just give you my ledger.

759
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,503
Andre, this, this woman
is very funny, isn't she?

760
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:29,879
Mm.

761
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:32,848
Yeah, I'll just give
you the ledger.

762
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:34,433
You free my product,

763
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:37,304
and you have the balls
to make demands on me?

764
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,271
You, you are something.

765
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:42,976
I know exactly why you're here.

766
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:46,275
I know who sent you.

767
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:50,491
And you, you little Judas,

768
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,655
you took that money, didn't you?

769
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,326
Oh!

770
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:07,170
I find that to be
very audacious.

771
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:09,214
You own a toothbrush?

772
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,096
Games.

773
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:23,599
Games, Andre, they always
have to play games, right?

774
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:27,274
You're risking your life,

775
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,317
and you don't even understand
the big picture.

776
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:34,276
Here.

777
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:38,372
Here's the ledger.
It's all here.

778
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,992
Oh, oh, let's... let's
not tempt fate.

779
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:48,254
Every deal I ever made
is right in this ledger.

780
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:52,754
What can I say?
Call me old-school.

781
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:56,804
And what really fascinates me
is that he sent you

782
01:04:56,810 --> 01:05:00,679
to get this ledger, and you
agreed without hesitation.

783
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:03,814
And kill you.

784
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:06,230
Oh, to kill me.

785
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,570
Wow.

786
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:21,206
So, here's what I'm gonna do.

787
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:26,830
You cost me a lot of money
when you freed my product.

788
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,583
And, uh, you still look like

789
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:32,335
you have a few good
rides in you, right?

790
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:36,464
So I'm gonna ply
my boys up with Sildenafil,

791
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:39,308
and I'm gonna give you to them,
so they could have their way

792
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:43,520
with you for
as long as they want.

793
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:48,860
And when they bore of you,
in about a year,

794
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:53,152
I'm gonna sell you at
a very deep discount

795
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:56,868
to the Eastern
European mongrels,

796
01:05:56,870 --> 01:06:00,454
and maybe I'll get a
little bit back of what I lost.

797
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:03,621
Or, we make a deal,

798
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:07,620
and you avoid
a slow, painful death.

799
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:12,463
You got nothing
I want or need.

800
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:15,962
He'll send someone else.

801
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:20,763
Or better yet, come himself.

802
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:23,260
Oh, Vladik.

803
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:29,642
Vladik and I, suffice it to say,

804
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:33,487
we've been doing this dance
a long, long time, you know?

805
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,447
He's my personal Sisyphus.

806
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:38,409
You know who Sisyphus is?
Do you?

807
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:42,451
Good. You know, up and down,
up and down.

808
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:46,667
And of course, he absolutely
despises my skin trade business.

809
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:49,958
But the Rhodes Scholar Richie
explained to me

810
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:53,753
the only reason Vladik
really wants to eliminate me

811
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,175
and Kane is so he could
expand his own empire.

812
01:06:58,181 --> 01:07:00,844
There's nothing new here.

813
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,308
It's really cliché.

814
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:08,352
You know, long live
the king, that B.S.

815
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:09,974
So, my love...

816
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,438
You get some rest.

817
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:18,407
You're gonna be wishing
for it when my...

818
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,526
when my boys get a hold of you.

819
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,244
Mm.

820
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:24,284
Andre.

821
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:10,409
Oh, that's nice, that's nice.

822
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,752
Turn around.

823
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:14,417
Uh-huh.
Now bend over, bend over.

824
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:17,633
Put... put your butt more to me.

825
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:20,423
Now look this way.
Oh, that's great.

826
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:25,425
Okay, arch your back, now.
Arch your back.

827
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:28,428
Come on, show me your tits,
put them over here.

828
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:31,306
Come on, stick your...
Stick your boobs out.

829
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:32,602
Take your arms
and put them together.

830
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:34,601
Make them look bigger.

831
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:35,852
Yeah, arch your back,
look right here...

832
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:37,319
Oh, that's nice.

833
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:39,279
Oh, they're gonna
love you in Serbia.

834
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:40,944
- Mm.
- Yeah, smile.

835
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,738
Come on, look like
you're having a great time.

836
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:44,952
That's nice.

837
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:48,243
Yeah.

838
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:49,615
Excellent.

839
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:51,208
Okay, now look at me,
look at me.

840
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,293
Arch your...
keep arching your back.

841
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:54,628
Oh, that's good.

842
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:09,221
Bitch!

843
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:42,463
What is it?

844
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:43,927
Open the glove box.

845
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:48,841
Had I wanted to kill you, you
would have been dead already.

846
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:52,094
If you seek answers,
open the glove box.

847
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:53,937
Fine!

848
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:57,979
More games?

849
01:09:57,985 --> 01:09:59,601
Now the envelope.

850
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,113
Mika's at your place?

851
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,907
Bring me my bag.

852
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:41,352
Where is Mika?

853
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,603
Gimme the case.

854
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:44,229
Mika first.

855
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,276
He's not here.

856
01:10:45,283 --> 01:10:46,569
You said he was here.

857
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,317
No, I said bring me my things.

858
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,740
- You lied?
- And you stole.

859
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:53,034
Where's my son?
Where's Mika?

860
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,156
He's with Kane.

861
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:56,079
What? Why?

862
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,997
Because I owe Kane
a lot of money.

863
01:10:58,004 --> 01:11:01,088
More than you stole.
He forced my hand.

864
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,673
I had no choice
but to manipulate you.

865
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:05,542
So you let him take our son?

866
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,129
A son I've never known.

867
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:13,475
Because I didn't want him
to be anywhere near this life.

868
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:16,596
Because he is innocent.
He's pure.

869
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:18,814
He's the exact
opposite of what we are,

870
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,432
don't you understand that?

871
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:23,939
He's the one thing
that you gave me

872
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,778
that I'm actually grateful for.

873
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:30,117
So yes, I saw the opportunity,

874
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,953
and I took the money
and your guns,

875
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:36,995
because I wanted him to be as
far away from this place and...

876
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,617
And me?

877
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,870
Yes, and you.

878
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,623
What we had was about us.

879
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:49,211
Now it's about Mika.
- I know.

880
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:51,179
And that's the only thing
that matters.

881
01:11:51,182 --> 01:11:55,347
If I don't get that money to
Kane by 7:00, our son is dead.

882
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:57,766
Then help me get our son back.

883
01:12:14,664 --> 01:12:17,077
Vladik, for old times.

884
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,332
Thank you.

885
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,455
Let's do this.

886
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:41,013
Oh, shit!

887
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:42,764
Look at that.

888
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,562
If it ain't the fucking
king and queen of the prom,

889
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:45,889
back together again,
look at that.

890
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:50,030
Well, I guess I know what side
you've chosen, then, right?

891
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:53,150
- Where's my son?
- Where's my fucking bag?

892
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,526
The kid first.

893
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:56,529
Get the kid.

894
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:02,493
You son of a bitch,
get him out of the cage, now.

895
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:05,079
Let him out.

896
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:15,802
I gotta thank you, Rhona, for
taking care of my dirty laundry.

897
01:13:15,808 --> 01:13:18,050
I appreciate it.
Couldn't have done it myself.

898
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:22,893
And you, you got
something for me?

899
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:23,980
Yeah.

900
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:25,975
This is how it's gonna play out.

901
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:28,898
She'll go get the bag.
You give us the kid.

902
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:31,613
Oh, that's how it's
gonna play out.

903
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:33,903
You fucking hear him, Rhona?

904
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,526
Move!

905
01:13:35,536 --> 01:13:37,198
Go get the bag.

906
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:42,412
You know, I gotta...
I gotta be honest with you.

907
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:45,957
Initially, I didn't
see the resemblance at all.

908
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:49,206
Now, I mean, it's there,
clean as day, right?

909
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:51,674
You squirted that outta
your dick, didn't ya?

910
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:54,841
I had no fucking idea.

911
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:57,260
Hell of a mom, though, Jesus.

912
01:13:57,266 --> 01:14:00,384
Whew, good score on that.

913
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:02,807
Lucky sperm club, that kid, huh?

914
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,774
Is it gonna
hurt your feelings

915
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:17,572
if I tell you that
I'd threw a leg over that?

916
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:20,116
Would it?
Yeah, buddy.

917
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:24,287
Just know, I planted my flag
on the fucking moon,

918
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,080
and you're a cosmonaut.

919
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:27,498
That feel good?

920
01:14:27,505 --> 01:14:29,087
So how was the pie?

921
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:32,549
Oh, the pie, the pie
was fucking Entenmann:

922
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:34,463
creamy, delicious.

923
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:35,881
Fucking Entenmann.

924
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:40,762
Okay. Let's go.

925
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:47,598
That's far enough.
Right there on the table.

926
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:49,224
Ricky.

927
01:14:54,782 --> 01:14:56,819
How we doing, Ricky?

928
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,658
We're good.

929
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,152
Right here.

930
01:15:03,708 --> 01:15:05,620
Let the kid go.

931
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:10,958
Let's see what we got here.

932
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:16,877
What the fuck is this?

933
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,298
Shit!

934
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:25,889
Get the kid!

935
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:22,950
Oh!

936
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:31,428
Ugh!

937
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,061
Dad!

938
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:40,437
Ah!

939
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,278
Hey, kid...

940
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:48,282
Why don't you
go see your mom, huh?

941
01:17:52,626 --> 01:17:54,162
Atta boy.

942
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:57,038
Baby, are you okay?
Are you okay?

943
01:17:58,174 --> 01:17:59,710
Good.

944
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:01,517
It's only ever been
about you and me, right?

945
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:06,130
Go, get outta here.

946
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,052
Get outta here,
take care of him.

947
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:12,473
Go!

948
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:20,773
So tell me, buddy, how you
see this playing out, huh?

949
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:23,396
I don't know.
What do you think?

950
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:26,534
I don't know.

951
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:29,285
Maybe it's time
for some of those

952
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:31,450
crying hookers, though, eh?

953
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:33,699
Maybe it's just
a poor man's funeral.

954
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:42,457
Come on.

955
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:17,830
Your money's been deposited,
Banco de Mexico,

956
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:20,419
Calle Monte de Herales 602,

957
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:25,963
Lomas de Chapultepec,
Box 020232060832.

958
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,552
Send me a postcard.

959
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:31,932
David? Thank you.

960
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:33,425
Be safe.

961
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:54,704
Like I said, in this business,
there is no room for mistakes.

962
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:59,372
Aside from a few bumps in the
road, my plan worked perfectly.

963
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:02,041
I kept the money, sold the guns,

964
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,460
and I got my son back.

965
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:08,961

gas and start a new life.
