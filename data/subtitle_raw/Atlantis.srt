1
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,880
ATLANTIS

2
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,200
2025, Eastern Ukraine.
One year after the war.

3
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,800
Are you ready ?

4
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,400
- Yeah, let's shoot.
- Let's.

5
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,240
Three, eleven.

6
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,600
- Ready ?
- Ready !

7
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,520
- Time ?
- Three, fifty-nine.

8
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,200
Okay, let's do it separately.

9
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,240
- Ready ?
- Yes !

10
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,560
Four, eighteen.

11
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,320
- Ready ?
- Yes !

12
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,440
- Time ?
- Three, twenty.

13
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,000
- Awesome !
- Good job, Ivan.

14
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,200
- So ? Let's make it harder.
- Yes ! Let's go.

15
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,560
From the center to the right,
from the center to the left. Ready ?

16
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,920
- Ready ?
- Yes !

17
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,320
Hit it, you bitch, fucking hit it !

18
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,640
- Ready ?
- Ready !

19
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,560
Task! First, third, seventh, fifth.

20
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,080
Go random. Go, you motherfucker !

21
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,040
Shit !

22
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,880
No worries.

23
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,120
Task.

24
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,000
From the right to the center,
from the left to the center.

25
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,880
You start from the right.
Are you fucking ready ?

26
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,800
- Yes.
- Damn it, are you ready ?

27
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,680
Ready ? Go fucking hard,
come on, you piece of shit.

28
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,120
Holy fuck. Fuck !

29
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,720
Second, sixth, eighth target.

30
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,200
- Random order. Got it ?
- Got it.

31
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,920
Go.

32
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,640
- Fuck
- Come on ! Shoot !

33
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,840
Piss off ! Are you fucking nuts ?

34
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,440
- Are you ?
- What ?

35
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,720
- You can shoot me in my vest as well.
- Easy-peasy.

36
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,000
Cunt. Shell-shocked !

37
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,480
Fuck ! Damn it !

38
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,320
Fuck.

39
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,360
Sit down, chill.

40
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,600
Does it hurt ?

41
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,280
It fucking does.

42
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,280
Will you even go to work tomorrow ?

43
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,520
I'm fed up with fucking
work and the workers.

44
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,280
They just walk around looking at me
as if I was some kind of monster.

45
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,360
Talk behind my back.

46
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,160
I went to war and
thought something might change.

47
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,200
No fucking way.

48
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,520
They are still die-hard Soviets.

49
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,680
They want a tsar to come
and solve all their problems.

50
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,440
At first, I wanted to shoot them all,

51
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,680
but then I realized
I'd better disappear myself.

52
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,720
Are you losing it again ?

53
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,640
I'm so messed up, I don't remember
when was the last time I slept.

54
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,680
Pass me the jar.

55
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,480
Shitty bullets again.

56
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,040
They're regular bullets.

57
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,160
- Hey man.
- Hi there.

58
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,120
I messed up last night. I'm sorry.

59
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,640
Never mind. It's my fault.

60
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,520
- How are you ?
- Crappy, haven't slept again.

61
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,000
Can't get myself together,

62
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,640
I need to quit the factory,
I'm going crazy.

63
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,440
And go where ?

64
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,080
Maybe go somewhere as contractors ?

65
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,680
To shoot again, at least there's
some point in it, unlike here.

66
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,520
Aren't you shell-shocked enough ?
More blood ? More death ?

67
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,520
Fine, let's get back to work.

68
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,640
What kind of work is that ?
A lick and a promise ?

69
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,480
I've worked here for forty years,
haven't seen anything like that before.

70
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,760
Good for nothing.
Who welds like that ?

71
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,600
You used to weld like a man !

72
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,320
Do it over again !

73
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,120
And don't spare the electrodes,
the seam should be thick.

74
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,880
I'll come back to check on you.

75
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,720
You, your fathers and your grandfathers
worked long and hard

76
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,200
to produce this living
for your families.

77
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,600
You produced quality steel,
that was sold across the world.

78
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:08,280
You delivered the old Ukraine.

79
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,240
But the times are changing.

80
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,640
Everything has a beginning
and an end.

81
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,960
Today, is my sad task to tell you

82
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,040
that this great works are gonna
be closed for reconstruction.

83
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,560
Yes, I understand your concern.
But there's no choice.

84
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,680
New times are upon us.

85
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,640
New technologies make
the old way redundant.

86
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,600
These new technologies
provide new opportunities.

87
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:00,560
And together, we propose to work
for a new future.

88
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,920
A competitive Ukraine,
a bright Ukraine.

89
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,200
So let's just not glorify the past

90
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,560
Yes, there was the heroic spirit
of the past.

91
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,640
Let's harness the new technologies.

92
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,520
Let's celebrate
the new future together.

93
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,720
So, thank you. Let's drink !

94
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,120
Reconstruction ?
What new technologies ?

95
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,040
They'll just shut it down !

96
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,440
They will...

97
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,600
- You're right.
- No one will invest into this.

98
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,360
In the US, they don't close
their plants, you know.

99
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,560
They are just eliminating the
competition, whatever they say,

100
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,360
it could still be profitable. You see ?

101
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,320
It could be.
We just have to stop stealing.

102
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,600
Metal is exported, and brings
foreign currency to the budget.

103
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,720
And we have to pay off the debts
which are higher than GDP.

104
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,880
Can you imagine
what this could lead to ?

105
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,600
Our grandchildren won't be able
to pay off these debts.

106
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,560
In two years it will be a desert here.

107
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,440
Did they pump out
the water from the mines ?

108
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,920
No, they didn't !

109
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,280
The water in the river is already salty.

110
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,200
You can't drink it anymore.

111
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,040
I suggest we go to Crimea.
I'll go there myself,

112
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,640
the bridge there has collapsed,
they've got a lot of work to do.

113
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,960
And what ? You'll take it
apart and sell the metal ?

114
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,600
Nineteen kilometers of bridge !

115
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,720
It's all because of your friend,
shell-shock.

116
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,760
Are you happy they're shutting down the
plant ? Is this what you fought for ?

117
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,920
Is that the reason you killed people ?

118
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,640
How many lives have you got
on your conscience ?

119
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,360
He was fighting to protect you !

120
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,640
Me ? Did I ask you to protect me ?

121
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,200
Was my life bad ? I had a job.

122
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,800
Now I don't. Fucking bastards !

123
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,440
You work alternate weeks,

124
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,760
here is your itinerary list and a pass
should the patrol stop you.

125
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,920
They put checks here
and here on the border.

126
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,840
Sign here. Safety training passed.

127
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,480
And here to state your liability
for the vehicle.

128
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,720
You'd better get back by daylight,

129
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,000
as there are almost
no civilians in the zone,

130
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,280
if the car breaks down,
it will take a long time to get help.

131
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,320
You'd better fix everything yourself,
you have a tool box,

132
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,280
and pour the remaining
water into bottles.

133
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,600
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

134
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,440
Good afternoon, have you got a pen ?

135
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,360
Here you go.

136
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,920
What we gonna do ?

137
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,320
- Take care.
- Thanks.

138
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,440
Good afternoon !

139
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,120
You can't go any further,
de-miners are working there now.

140
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,200
You've got water ? Come again ?

141
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,480
- There will be an explosion.
- Roger.

142
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,400
Let's step aside.

143
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,840
So ? Have you found any ?

144
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,960
We've covered about a hundred
meters today,

145
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,760
found about four AT mines, seems
like the whole field used to be AT.

146
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,360
I see, the Russians probably thought
we'd be attacking them with tanks.

147
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,080
Come on, pull over here.
I'll take the can.

148
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,320
- How does it work ?
- I'll turn it on. Some mud.

149
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,360
So, have you found only ATs
or something better ?

150
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,440
No, lots of ATs here, as you say,
and we've found also POMZes,

151
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,680
PMNs, fifties, nineties,

152
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,320
and we try to destroy everything
we can, here or elsewhere.

153
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,480
It'll take 15-20 years, at least.

154
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,560
I see. Did they leave
a lot of PFMs here ?

155
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:20,400
They did, the boys found
about fifty in the woods

156
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,000
and went on to destroy them.

157
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,000
Can I go round somehow ?

158
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,280
Yes, there's a road
to the left, go there,

159
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,400
we cleared it, make sure
to go down it, don't digress,

160
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,480
then you'll get to the highway
and see for yourself where to go.

161
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,000
- It's full.
- Yep.

162
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,080
- Okay, buddy, see you.
- Take care.

163
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,800
Good evening.
I'm sorry to stop you,

164
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,280
we're stuck, and have been here
for three hours, we can't get out.

165
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,240
- Hi, what's wrong ?
- The engine is dead.

166
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,160
- Where do you need to go ?
- To the town.

167
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,240
So, I'd have to pull you all the way ?

168
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,600
- Do you have a rope ?
- I do.

169
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:41,760
Let me see, your vehicle is heavy,
I hope it doesn't break.

170
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:52,160
Great, hook it up to me,
loop it over you, I'll pull, okay ?

171
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,880
Let me get in the car with you,
I'll show you the way.

172
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,360
Okay.

173
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,920
Call our guys,
tell them we've set out.

174
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,160
Okay.

175
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,520
It's nice that you are warm in here

176
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,520
because we've been standing
like that for over three hours.

177
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,840
No cars, we got awfully cold,

178
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,360
and the vehicle has just been repaired,
but it broke down again.

179
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,240
In less than a week.

180
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,320
No wonder, with the roads like this.

181
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,760
Something's dripping over here.

182
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,000
It's rattling so much.

183
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,440
It's an old horse,
but still going strong.

184
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,560
Put it over here.

185
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,560
- Hi.
- Good evening.

186
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,120
- We got tired of waiting for you.
- We thought we'd never make it.

187
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,280
This is for you, this is for us,
your signature.

188
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,400
Nina, Vitaliy, come here,
we need to work.

189
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,480
Hi.

190
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,720
Hi.

191
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,800
Help me. Grab his shoulder.

192
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,000
Let's work.

193
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,960
A body is delivered.
The body's dressed in a green jacket,

194
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,600
with a plastic zipper

195
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,800
and plastic buttons,

196
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,000
also green.

197
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,280
The cloth is wet,

198
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:07,440
the whole area is covered
with grayish soil,

199
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,960
there are numerous tears in the cloth
of different shapes and sizes,

200
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,960
black fleece sweater,
with a zipper,

201
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,320
two pockets,
the pockets are empty,

202
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,640
sweater material is wet,

203
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,000
also covered with a layer
of grayish soil.

204
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,000
A T-shirt, wet,

205
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,440
color is hard to detect,

206
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,400
the front and the sides

207
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,720
are severely damaged,

208
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,080
the cloth of the T-shirt disintegrates
during the examination,

209
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,400
military type pants,

210
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,760
dark and light green,

211
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,480
a label on the left leg,

212
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,880
MA-034.

213
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:14,760
Snizhne 16.03 11:45.

214
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,760
The cloth is wet, covered with dirt.

215
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,360
Patch pockets on the sides button up

216
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,680
with green buttons.

217
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,080
The pockets are empty.

218
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:38,440
Black underpants,
wet material, dirty,

219
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,720
not damaged,

220
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:48,960
black boots, black laces,

221
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:53,160
black soles, size 43.

222
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,400
How long will it take ?
I'm running late for the base.

223
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,880
Just two more minutes.

224
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,480
Just a little more.

225
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:10,360
Socks in the boots, synthetic black,
foot bones inside.

226
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,400
After taking off the clothes,
the corpse is of proper stature,

227
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,800
male,

228
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,520
in a state of advanced
mortem changes

229
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,880
in partial skeletonization
and mummification.

230
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,760
Oval head,

231
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:37,000
skull is deformed on the left
half of the brain,

232
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:42,560
dark hair in the right
frontal-lobe section.

233
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,160
How long was he there
in that state ?

234
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,240
A year, maybe a year and a half.
Depending on the conditions.

235
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,880
A layer of soil on the front
surface of the neck.

236
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,920
The mouth is open,

237
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,880
soil and...

238
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:14,080
And six bullets,
caliber seven sixty two,

239
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:19,040
in his oral cavity,
they are covered with soil, wet, dull.

240
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,080
- He is a captive sniper.
- Why do you think so ?

241
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,640
The bullets, caliber fifty four,
light with a steel plug,

242
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,080
when the sniper was held captive,
after intense interrogation,

243
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,080
they would put bullets in his mouth
one after another,

244
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,320
make him swallow,

245
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,320
and when he had a mouthful,

246
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,760
they'd just finish him with a club
and then bury him.

247
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,280
Perhaps that's what happened.

248
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,680
No injuries in the neck area.

249
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,840
- Right hand is missing.
- Anything else to photograph ?

250
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,440
- No, that will do.
- We'll be heading home then.

251
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,280
- Fine, good bye.
- Good bye.

252
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,720
Right hand is missing,

253
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,600
left arm and hand are missing.

254
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,840
Joint surfaces are wet,

255
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,800
the cartilaginous part
is preserved, dense.

256
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,240
Lift him up.

257
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:36,680
Skin is missing at the back.

258
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:41,200
Soft tissue is missing all the way

259
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,560
from shoulder blades to pelvis,

260
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:51,360
the bones are wet, dull,
covered with mucus and mold.

261
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,080
A skull fragment
of rectangular shape

262
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,240
came with the body,

263
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,520
12 by 9 cm,

264
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,600
fine-tongued edges,

265
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,120
dark brown on the inside surface,

266
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,520
light yellow on the outside one.

267
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,320
The external examination is over.

268
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,360
We are moving on to the internal one
and the injuries. Get ready, Vitalik.

269
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,920
What a job you have,
only dead bodies every day.

270
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,840
Actually, not every day,

271
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,920
sometimes it takes a month
or more to find one.

272
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,600
Aren't you tired of it ?
What did you do before the war ?

273
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,440
You won't believe it,
I was doing a degree in archaeology,

274
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:07,280
so I can say I'm following
my profession.

275
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,360
It's just that the events
took place during our lifetime,

276
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,480
and not thousands of years ago,

277
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,360
it's like you are digging up
your own history.

278
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,040
And what brought you here,
to the war ?

279
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,160
I joined as a paramedic.

280
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,000
It was almost the end of the war.

281
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,760
We had a lot of injured,

282
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,040
we took out only the ones
who could make it,

283
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,480
and now we have to go back

284
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,000
for the ones we left behind.

285
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:16,520
It must be hard.
How do you get through it ?

286
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,960
It's hard, but I'm trying
to look at it another way.

287
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,760
We let the dead
say good bye to their relatives,

288
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,760
finish their life story and their war.

289
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,400
It's important.

290
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,560
Are you at least
getting paid for this ?

291
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,440
Getting paid ?
This is our own volunteer project,

292
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,720
we are looking for funding.

293
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,280
Basically, I work alternate weeks,

294
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:12,360
you can count on me,
if you need help.

295
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,040
That would be great. Thank you.

296
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,720
Found a body
of an unidentified person,

297
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,720

Soft tissue on the right and
left facial bones is missing.

309
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,840
Pack it up.

310
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,960
Mummified body
of an unknown person,

311
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:28,200

the bones are bare.

324

Let's pack him into the bag.

325
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,280
Put it over here.

326
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,560
The bones

327
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,360

337
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,920
- How are you feeling ?
- Fine, I'll be fine.

338
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,320
Here, rub this under your nose.

339
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:50,160
We've all been through it.

340
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:57,320
Good afternoon.

341
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,480
Here are the documents.

342
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,160
Boys, come on.

343
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,320
There is the registration number.

344
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:14,000
- I see.
- Signature here.

345
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:19,120
This is the statement
from the morgue.

346
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,280
Signature here.

Here.

348
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,440
And here.

349
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:46,240
- Is that it ?
- Yes, the rest is for us.

350
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:48,920
When's the next one ?

351
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:53,240
We are waiting for the results,
but no sooner than in a week.

352
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:58,600
Let me tell you,

353
01:20:58,680 --> 01:21:00,920
forty seven

354
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,520
sixty nine

355
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,720
dash three hundred forty nine

356
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:10,600
dash thirty one.

357
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:15,320
- Okay. Later.
- Good bye.

358
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:19,200
Let's go, Sergiy.

359
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,720
Good bye.

360
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:14,080
Here is your itinerary list,
it goes through the check point.

361
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,920
They've filled up the vehicle
with water, it will be here soon.

362
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,560
- Good.
- Take care.

363
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,440
- Hello.
- Hi. Do you remember me ?

364
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,800
Yes, of course.
How are you feeling ?

365
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,400
- Better, thanks.
- Good to hear.

366
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:57,680
- Let's talk in the car.
- Sure.

367
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:13,480
Thank you for rescuing me that time.

368
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:16,480
If it weren't for you,

369
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:20,040
everything could have turned out
really badly for me.

370
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:21,920
Be more careful next time.

371
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:24,920
There are a lot of mines
still scattered around here.

372
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:27,000
Not only mines.

373
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:31,920
My organization deals
with ecological monitoring

374
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,840
in such dangerous zones.

375
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:37,520
And I want to say
that due to the war

376
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:41,240
this territory became completely
unsuitable for living.

377
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:47,520
Everything will change, with time.

378
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:51,440
Hundreds of flooded mines,
destroyed factories ?

379
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,200
They've polluted all the water.

380
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:57,480
The changes are irreversible.

381
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:03,680
Water can be delivered, distilled.

382
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:07,760
Yes, it can, but it's not profitable.

383
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:14,280
I think the only way out now
is to leave this place.

384
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,880
So many years of war,
just to leave ?

385
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:31,600
It took you ten years
to clean this territory

386
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:35,760
of the poison of Soviet
propaganda and myths.

387
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:42,120
But now you have to clean
the water and soil.

388
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,880
That will take decades,

389
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,680
even hundreds of years.

390
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:57,080
My stay here will end soon,

391
01:25:57,200 --> 01:26:01,560
but my organization operates
in many countries.

392
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,360
We always have vacancies.

393
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:11,080
It's an opportunity
for you to go abroad

394
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,920
for a while,

395
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:16,680
or start a new life in Europe.

396
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,040
I can't answer right now.

397
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,080
I understand that.

398
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:31,840
These are my contacts.

399
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,320
You have time to make a decision.

400
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,160
Call me, when you do.

401
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:40,600
I am very grateful.

402
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:43,920
Okay. Thank you.

403
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,160
What is it ? Something serious ?

404
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:58,640
- Yes.
- Can we make it on our own ?

405
01:28:58,760 --> 01:29:01,400
- Nope.
- I see.

406
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:16,360
Hello.

407
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:20,280
Our engine is jammed.
We need a tow car.

408
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:26,320
Not far from the farm.
About two kilometers from the bridge.

409
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,840
Okay, we're waiting.

410
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,200
Have you been living here
for a long time ?

411
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,200
Yeah, for a while,

412
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:14,800
I like it here. It's quiet,

413
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:20,800
no one bothers you.

414
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,560
But that's not how it used to be ?

415
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,160
No.

416
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:53,280
I used to live like
all ordinary people,

417
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:55,960
and then everything
suddenly ended.

418
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:04,520
That's why you went to war ?

419
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,400
Perhaps.

420
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:14,720
At first I just wanted to die,

421
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:19,600
then I witnessed one death,
two, three,

422
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,880
I nearly died myself.

423
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:32,120
Then everything changed.

424
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:38,440
I realized that I had to keep living.

425
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:30,480
Why don't you leave here ?

426
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:34,160
What's the point ?

427
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:41,520
It will be harder to live
among ordinary people.

428
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:48,240
You can't trick yourself.

429
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:53,640
You either take yourself as you are

430
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:56,560
or you just disappear.

431
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:08,200
I am fine with it.

432
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,120
In fact,

433
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:19,400
this is a real reservation
for people like us.

434
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:23,000
You might be right.
