1
00:00:57,904 --> 00:01:03,904
Christ has risen from the dead

2
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:10,082
Trampling down death by death

3
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:15,989
And upon those in the tombs

4
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,899
Bestowing life

5
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,900
Christ has risen from the dead

6
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:31,901
Trampling down death by death

7
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,497
And upon those in the tombs

8
00:01:36,498 --> 00:01:42,124
Bestowing life

9
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:46,041
May God arise and His enemies scatter

10
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:49,329
May His foes flee before Him

11
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:54,457
Christ has risen from the dead

12
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:58,457
Trampling down death by death

13
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:02,157
And upon those in the tombs

14
00:02:02,158 --> 00:02:08,158
Bestowing life

15
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,693
This is the day
that the Lord has made

16
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,341
Let us rejoice and be glad in it

17
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:18,242
Christ has risen from the dead

18
00:02:18,243 --> 00:02:21,725
Trampling down death by death

19
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:25,650
And upon those in the tombs

20
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:31,651
Bestowing life

21
00:02:36,578 --> 00:02:39,415
Lift up your heads, O ye gates

22
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,390
And be ye lift up,
ye everlasting doors

23
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:45,153
And the King of glory shall come in

24
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:51,436
Lift up your heads, O ye gates

25
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,775
And be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors

26
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:57,652
And the King of glory shall come in

27
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,666
Open the door.

28
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,250
Father, even if God comes down,
we won't open.

29
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,666
I said, open the door.

30
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:34,250
We won't open,

31
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,416
even if the sky falls.

32
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:48,106
Open the door before I grab you
and finish you off.

33
00:03:48,107 --> 00:03:49,407
I will smash your bottle
over both your heads.

34
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:51,150
Open the door!

35
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:53,483
His Holiness doesn't get it.

36
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:54,975
Father, you have your head
in the clouds.

37
00:03:54,976 --> 00:03:57,750
I'll tell you what, Father,

38
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,666
how about you take off
and come back later?

39
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,958
We might open then.

40
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,000
Forgive me Lord.

41
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:49,999
Have mercy, Father!

42
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,832
Christ has risen from the dead

43
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:59,500
Trampling down death by death

44
00:05:02,263 --> 00:05:08,055
And upon those in the tombs

45
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,874
Neighbor, don't think I'm stealing.

46
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,832
I usually knock on the door
for permission.

47
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,625
I did knock, but no one was there.

48
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,083
Our sister says the food is sour.

49
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,000
Sour?

50
00:09:58,416 --> 00:09:59,833
What do you mean by sour?

51
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,791
I'm not sure, but it tastes acidic.

52
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:08,332
I'm sorry you don't like it.

53
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:11,750
But that acidity comes
from the wine sauce.

54
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,666
It's how it should taste.

55
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,500
What did you say?
Did you say wine?

56
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:21,875
Yes, wine.

57
00:10:30,075 --> 00:10:31,375
White.

58
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:36,208
So you are telling us
our sister was drinking alcohol

59
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,333
without us knowing?

60
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:41,832
It wasn't exactly your sister

61
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,500
but the chicken
who drank the alcohol.

62
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,041
That's how it is then!

63
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,750
You're going to pay for this.
Are you aware of that?

64
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,666
I'm to blame, I'm very sorry.

65
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,583
I should have warned you.

66
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,999
These two glasses
are on the house.

67
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,666
And we'll top them up.

68
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:42,916
Neighbor,

69
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,916
it's time this lemon tree got pruned.

70
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:49,583
You'll see, after I do it,
the lemons will be this big.

71
00:13:30,283 --> 00:13:31,583
Neighbor!

72
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:36,625
Neighbor!

73
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,416
Neighbor

74
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:50,708
Neighbor...

75
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:54,458
The other day,
I had an urge to go hunting.

76
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,782
As I was lurking for boars,

77
00:13:56,783 --> 00:13:58,083
I look up

78
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:02,832
and see a large eagle,
its wings spread, each 2 meters long

79
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,875
whirling around,
as if looking for something.

80
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:10,041
I look closer
And what do I see?

81
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,833
A giant snake coiled up.

82
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,375
Suddenly,
the eagle brings its wings in

83
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:22,708
and swoops down on it,
like a rocket.

84
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,250
Before it grabs the snake,
I put a bullet in it,

85
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,624
it drops dead next to it.

86
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,041
The snake lifts its head,

87
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,500
stares at me, then at the eagle,

88
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,375
then back at me,

89
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,291
lifts its head up,
does like this to me

90
00:14:40,616 --> 00:14:41,916
and slides away.

91
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,708
A few days later,
I was sitting home bored.

92
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,125
I told my wife I was going out.

93
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:52,500
I took my rifle and went hunting.

94
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,874
The sun set,
it started to get chilly.

95
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:59,958
I had a dozen partridges
hanging from my waist.

96
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,875
I said to myself: Let's go home.

97
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,630
I get to my Jeep
and find it slanted like that.

98
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,583
The rear tire completely flat.

99
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,666
Then, I hear a noise
in the bushes.

100
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:15,666
I point my rifle,

101
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,707
thinking it's a hyena
coming out to eat me.

102
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,165
Let's get it before it gets me.

103
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,875
I had only one bullet left.

104
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:27,083
I point my rifle
and right before pulling the trigger,

105
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,875
and who do I see?
The snake.

106
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:31,833
That same snake.

107
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:36,415
It comes towards me,
my gun still pointed at it,

108
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:41,666
passes by me,
and goes straight for the flat tire.

109
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,499
It opens its mouth
and puts it around the valve.

110
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,291
It breathes in and out into the tire.

111
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,415
Inhale and exhale.

112
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,208
It blew into it
until it became hard as a rock.

113
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,250
Then, it looked at me,
lifted its neck,

114
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,208
did like this to me

115
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:02,208
and slid away.

116
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:06,125
Neighbor,

117
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,625
now I'll go home, make a barbecue,

118
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,166
with a few glasses of Arak.

119
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:16,166
Come join me, neighbor,
you're most welcome.

120
00:17:25,616 --> 00:17:26,916
You, come over!

121
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,750
Piss off.

122
00:19:17,325 --> 00:19:18,625
Neighbor...

123
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,750
I've never pissed this much
in my life.

124
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,333
I cannot stop.

125
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,666
- Thief.
- Trained by you.

126
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,457
- Piece of shit.
- Your shit.

127
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:41,875
- Filthy.
- Your filth.

128
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:50,041
- Drunkard.
- Just like you.

129
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,875
- Thug.
- Your upbringing.

130
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,541
- Rotten.
- Your stink.

131
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,625
- Scumbag.
- Your scum.

132
00:33:43,541 --> 00:33:45,333
Welcome.

133
00:33:45,334 --> 00:33:46,916
Welcome to Paris.

134
00:33:47,541 --> 00:33:49,125
- Welcome.
- Thank you

135
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,957
- Welcome to Paris.
- Goodbye

136
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:53,416
Welcome

137
00:33:57,991 --> 00:33:59,291
Thank you

138
00:40:22,958 --> 00:40:24,916
Hello, sir. How are you?

139
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,583
- Are you unwell?
- No.

140
00:40:26,584 --> 00:40:29,790
Any headache? Heart, stomach?
Numbness in the legs?

141
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:32,125
Are you taking any medications?

142
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:34,250
- You're thirsty maybe?
- Yes.

143
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,499
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

144
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,707
- Chicken or beef?
- Chicken.

145
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:41,782
- Pasta, Tabbouleh, both?
- Both.

146
00:40:41,783 --> 00:40:43,083
Some dessert with that?

147
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:45,281
Panna cotta, tiramisu, chocolate?

148
00:40:45,282 --> 00:40:46,582
Chocolate.

149
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:48,666
- Coffee or tea?
- Coffee.

150
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,583
- Do you have any allergies?
- No.

151
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,540
Central for number 7.

152
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:02,235
We are at the corner
of Vaucanson and Vertbois.

153
00:41:02,236 --> 00:41:04,811
We have someone who's a bit tired.
He was reported to us.

154
00:41:04,812 --> 00:41:07,840
He's alone now, but he's okay.

155
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:10,625
We gave him water and food.
We're off.

156
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:12,000
Over.

157
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:18,375
There you go.

158
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,425
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

159
00:41:20,426 --> 00:41:21,776
Is that all for you?

160
00:41:21,777 --> 00:41:24,000
Great.
We'll pass by later in any case.

161
00:41:24,001 --> 00:41:26,000
Ok, see you later, sir.
Enjoy your meal.

162
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:11,625
Are you Bridget?

163
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:16,333
Are you Bridget?

164
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:29,166
We are looking for Bridget

165
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:34,849
Mr. Suleiman, thank you

166
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:37,708
Thank you
for sharing this project with us.

167
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,832
As you know, this is the type
of project that interests us.

168
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:44,833
This is a film
about the Palestinian conflict.

169
00:54:44,834 --> 00:54:47,875
You know we have a certain sympathy
for the Palestinian cause.

170
00:54:48,291 --> 00:54:54,124
It's not that you've made a film
that's too didactic

171
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:57,249
or exotic about Palestine.

172
00:54:57,250 --> 00:55:03,250
But we could almost say
your film is not Palestinian enough.

173
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:07,207
It's not for commercial reasons,
because this kind of film

174
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:10,666
...doesn't make money.
That's not why we make them.

175
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:13,434
We make them only
because we're trying to be useful.

176
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,567
However, this project
doesn't correspond

177
00:55:15,568 --> 00:55:18,083
...with our editorial policy.

178
00:55:18,084 --> 00:55:21,791
We were under the impression
that it would take place in Palestine,

179
00:55:21,792 --> 00:55:24,541
...but it might as well be anywhere.

180
00:55:24,916 --> 00:55:26,791
It could even take place here.

181
00:55:27,708 --> 00:55:30,125
Therefore, I don't think
we'll be moving forward.

182
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:32,541
Of course, we would have loved to.

183
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:35,540
Despite our initial excitement,

184
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:38,916
I'm afraid it will be a no
from us on this project.

185
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:48,750
Did you understand what I said?
Do you get it?

186
01:01:44,241 --> 01:01:45,541
2 meters 60.

187
01:01:56,908 --> 01:01:58,208
90.

188
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:03,583
90.

189
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:11,833
3 meters 90.

190
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:25,579
- Hello ma'am.
- Good Morning

191
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,375
We came to check your terrace.

192
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,375
Everything looks good.

193
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:33,790
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

194
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:36,625
Have a good day.
It's in compliance. Let's go.

195
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:36,250
Please guys, please

196
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:49,875
Our beloved homeland, Palestine.

197
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:52,041
Guys!

198
01:20:54,791 --> 01:20:59,957
Please listen to me.

199
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:02,166
Please listen to me, guys,
please listen

200
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:15,541
But if we go on clapping this way,

201
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,958
time will be up
before anyone gets to speak.

202
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:22,208
So please,
a little calm.

203
01:21:23,208 --> 01:21:25,733
One clap will do
That should be enough, trust me.

204
01:21:25,734 --> 01:21:27,034
This much.

205
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:29,000
Agreed?

206
01:22:55,950 --> 01:22:57,250
Hey,

207
01:22:57,825 --> 01:22:59,125
what's up?

208
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:01,958
No, I'm here.

209
01:23:02,375 --> 01:23:05,457
Waiting for a meeting
with an American producer.

210
01:23:05,458 --> 01:23:08,290
Well, she's not American,
I don't know where she's from.

211
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:11,915
It's for a project
on the conquest of Mexico.

212
01:23:11,916 --> 01:23:14,041
For the 500th anniversary
of the conquest.

213
01:23:14,541 --> 01:23:17,666
About Cortes, Moctezuma
and all that stuff.

214
01:23:18,083 --> 01:23:19,957
But they want to do it in English.

215
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:21,790
In English, can you imagine?

216
01:23:21,791 --> 01:23:24,625
They want the Spanish
to speak English.

217
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:29,707
And the indigenous to speak
in Nahuatl or any other language.

218
01:23:29,708 --> 01:23:31,124
They don't care.

219
01:23:31,125 --> 01:23:33,290
So they'd sound like:

220
01:23:33,291 --> 01:23:36,458
"Hello, my name is Hernando Cortes
and I want to conquer you."

221
01:23:36,459 --> 01:23:38,999
It's going to be terrible, really.

222
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,833
But I won't do it. I'll tell her no.

223
01:23:42,416 --> 01:23:45,000
I'm here with my friend Elia,
Elia Suleiman.

224
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:47,582
He's a Palestinian from...

225
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:52,749
No, he's not a Palestinian from Israel.
He's a Palestinian from Palestine.

226
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:54,250
Yes a Palestinian from Palestine.

227
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:56,582
Yes, Palestine.

228
01:23:56,583 --> 01:23:58,165
Listen, we'll talk later, ok?

229
01:23:58,166 --> 01:24:00,500
Sorry, I'll call you later, bye.

230
01:24:02,083 --> 01:24:03,915
Hey Gael.

231
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:05,824
- How are you?
- Good, and you?

232
01:24:05,825 --> 01:24:07,332
- Good.
- Good.

233
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,166
Listen, excuse me,

234
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:44,833
but I want to tell you something.

235
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:50,208
You Palestinians are a weird bunch.

236
01:27:53,166 --> 01:27:55,208
The whole world drinks...

237
01:27:56,291 --> 01:27:58,000
in order to forget.

238
01:28:01,375 --> 01:28:03,916
You're the only people

239
01:28:04,833 --> 01:28:06,250
who drinks...

240
01:28:06,625 --> 01:28:08,000
in order to remember.

241
01:28:10,825 --> 01:28:12,125
Cheers.
