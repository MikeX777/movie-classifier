00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:20,643
REQUIEM FOR A VIRGIN KING

2
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,328
PART l
THE CURSE

3
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:51,611
<i>l am posh Lola
the favourite of the season</i>

4
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:55,118
<i>I have a pianola
at home in my salon</i>

5
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:11,336
I proclaim the curse of Lola Montez,

6
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:16,498
the cast-off mistress of Ludwig l,
the grandfather.

7
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,836
Cursing all that follows.

8
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,743
The incest of the parents,

9
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,352
Max of Bavaria
and Maria of Hohenzollern.

10
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,147
The birth of the second Ludwig,

11
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:34,716
the last king of Bavaria.

12
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:38,126
in the grip of royal madness,

13
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:41,267
furor paranoicus bavariae.

14
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,096
The House of Prussia will come

15
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,467
and annex Bavaria.
Found a German empire.

16
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,073
Curse!

17
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,240
A new era will come.

18
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:58,175
And with it
the proletarian breed.

19
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,013
l hear the proletarian masses.

20
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:13,296
l see
the fall of the Wittelsbachs.

21
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,304
King Ludwig

22
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,330
has no chance.

23
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:41,256
l proclaim his eternal life
in the memory of the people.

24
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:08,818
l see his torment!

25
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,422
l see his bliss in another way.

26
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:16,085
He will return in our dreams!

27
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:19,629
The finish: Environmental pollution!
- Pressure to produce!

28
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,858
Crimes against nature!

29
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:27,704
Over the span of years

30
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:32,108
the sore ate away the forest.

31
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:35,213
The leaves yellowed

32
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,177
and the tree withered away,

33
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:44,479
sadly the spring dried up.

34
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:51,526
Cursed be his descendants too.

35
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,212
IN THE LATTER YEARS OF HIS LIFE

36
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:39,644
IN THE LATTER YEARS OF HIS LIFE

37
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:44,272
LUDWIG II HAD HIMSELF WASHED AND
DRESSED WHEN HE ROSE IN THE EVENING.

38
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,951
HE LIVED AT NIGHT.

39
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,184
ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS HE SAW HIS LIFE
AS THE LIFE OF ONE NIGHT

40
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:57,259
HOW BARON HIRSCHBERG
FALLS INTO DISFAVOUR

41
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:27,150
De Varicourt,
a lovely name.

42
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,421
Cabinet Secretary Eisenhart
requests an audience.

43
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,055
Leave me be.

44
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:38,297
l can't stand
the sight of his stupid face any more.

45
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,719
Whoever looks with love upon
the night of death,

46
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:03,353
whoever is
entrusted with her darkest secrets,

47
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,298
the lies of daytime,
honour and glory,

48
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:13,198
power and riches,
no matter how dazzling,

49
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,903
are all blown away

50
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,240
like the vain dust of suns!

51
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,976
in the glare of the treacherous day

52
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,915
he has but one desire.

53
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:36,119
That slut Bulyowski can go to hell.

54
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,701
Hirschberg,

55
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,366
I'll make you cabinet secretary.

56
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:59,213
No, you are too pretty
to be cabinet secretary.

57
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:03,082
Then I'd have to annoy you.

58
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,687
Shall l make you a count?

59
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,427
How about a villa
like Wagner or Hornig?

60
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,663
A saddle-horse would be enough.

61
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,502
And a transfer
to the Foreign Office.

62
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:32,542
l have no possessions.

63
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,052
What belongs to me
belongs to everyone.

64
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,349
You belong to me.

65
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:43,718
l am the King;
whatever l like is right and proper.

66
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:49,664
Every subject must submit
to his Sovereign's will.

67
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,167
You must be mine.

68
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,745
Let them stay.

69
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,124
l never wish to see him again.

70
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,434
NEWS FROM THE COURT HAIRDRESSER,
HOPPE

71
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,335
NEWS FROM THE COURT HAIRDRESSER,
HOPPE

72
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:33,007
Without your work,
l cannot enjoy my breakfast.

73
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,674
What's new, Hoppe?

74
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:42,420
People say
that Madame Bulyowski

75
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:48,493
did not reciprocate your affection
when you laid

76
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:57,129
your head on her shoulder and
asked her to stroke your hair.

77
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,930
Apparently

78
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,906
at night

79
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:05,305
you sobbed the name

80
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:09,005
of Madame Bulyowski.

81
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:14,478
What do they say about my fiancée,
Duchess Sophie and me?

82
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,046
A handsome couple.

83
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:20,459
A handsome couple

84
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:26,254
and that Wagner received her.

85
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:29,167
He is clever,

86
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,563
only he doesn't know

87
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,470
that l won't marry her.

88
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,139
Go on.

89
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:53,387
Go on.
- Malvine Schnorr von Carolsfeld insulted

90
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:59,293
Corsima von Bülow because of her
liaison with Richard Wagner.

91
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:04,001
The ''Rhine Maidens''
were referred to

92
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:08,665
as aquarium whores
in the paper.

93
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,036
There'll be a libel suit.

94
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:16,473
Count Dürckheim
has been posted to the provinces;

95
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,675
a duel with His Highness

96
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,051
Prince Arnulf

97
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,913
over some woman.

98
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:30,157
Tell Prince Ludwig

99
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:34,231
not to keep pushing himself forward.

100
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:40,968
And Prince Luitpold shouldn't address me
without being spoken to first.

101
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,743
l am the King.

102
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,581
l still am.

103
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:56,752
I’ll dismiss
all my father's old servants.

104
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:01,482
l want to see only young faces.

105
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,097
THE KING LOVES DE VARICOURT
AND IS DISAPPOINTED IN HIM

106
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:10,433
THE KING LOVES DE VARICOURT
AND IS DISAPPOINTED IN HIM

107
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,466
Majesty,
the people's 12 oldest men are ready.

108
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,974
The ritual of feet washing
can now begin.

109
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:27,281
lf the King can ride
for 8 to 10 hours

110
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,751
without damaging his health,

111
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:35,357
he can also
spend a few days with his army.

112
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:42,525
The princes should
lower their heads more.

113
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:57,577
The Prussian State rewards Bismarck

114
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,811
with a million marks
for every war he wins.

115
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:16,228
The loveliest death would be

116
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,563
to die for you.

117
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,401
lf only this could soon come to pass.

118
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:29,938
A death more desirable than anything
this world can offer.

119
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,918
Varicourt,

120
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,493
you sleep
while your King is talking to you?

121
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,432
Take care of him.

122
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:53,061
l have acted my role as King badly.

123
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,274
LET'S GO ON AND PLAY GAMES
WITH THURN AND TAXIS

124
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:06,267
LET'S GO ON AND PLAY GAMES
WITH THURN AND TAXIS

125
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,911
A sofa for the decrepit Hartschier.

126
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:16,578
The poor man can't stand for very long.
Yes, a sofa.

127
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,933
Bismarck is delighted
with his war with Austria;

128
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:36,131
he can at last
kick her out of Germany.

129
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,879
I'm going to the Rose Island.

130
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,550
There is no telephone there.

131
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,290
To play games
with Thurn and Taxis.

132
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,262
We've been successful.

133
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,960
Our troops are in Thuringia,

134
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:08,266
and have already consumed
1,500 Prussian beers.

135
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:18,242
l can't stand the sight of these
cropped heads any more.

136
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,901
Let's go.

137
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:42,664
Let us listen
to their kingly babble.

138
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,870
Remove the sofa.

139
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:51,884
AUDIENCE

140
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,011
AUDIENCE

141
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,907
What are Gudden,
Holnstein and Lutz doing?

142
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,474
Gudden,

143
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,987
a German intellectual.

144
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,720
Power is nothing,

145
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,886
but the power of seduction is, eh?

146
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:41,294
Quite correct, Majesty.

147
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,435
All l will say

148
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,633
is that Wagner's time is coming.

149
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,645
Lutz,

150
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:02,517
l hear that your intrigues
have kept Wagner out,

151
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,156
with the help of the press.

152
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:10,821
But Munich's still become
the leading musical centre today,

153
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,362
with the help of the press.

154
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,059
Let's make him a minister,

155
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:21,036
otherwise he won't be afraid of me
and won't be able to depose me.

156
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,642
Holnstein,

157
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,781
we know each other well.

158
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,046
Allow me to introduce

159
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,550
my head stableman.

160
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:45,394
The master of my 200 horses.

161
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,698
My bosom friend

162
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,859
and betrayer.

163
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:57,006
He'll be my guardian.

164
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,807
The son of a bitch,

165
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:06,440
a faux pas
of my great-grandfather Wittelsbach.

166
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,243
It stays in the family.

167
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,320
My successors won't have to
worry about such things.

168
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,658
l shan't leave any children,

169
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,065
apart from my castles, of course.

170
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,129
So, what are we going to do today?

171
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,767
Bismarck said
that after a successful war

172
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:01,565
there's only
power and self-interest for him.

173
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:07,038
King Ludwig is a dreamer,
who does he have? What does he want?

174
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,407
according to Bismarck from Prussia.

175
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:13,384
Don't come so close,

176
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:15,577
l have bad teeth.

177
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,095
Bismarck asks

178
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:26,958
how much is required?

179
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,461
He refers to the distribution
of the Guelph treasure

180
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:37,337
if the Bavarian King offers
the King of Prussia the imperial crown.

181
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,614
Stay there

182
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:47,479
and look into the water
till it hurts your eyes.

183
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,247
They'll say l am mad

184
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,481
because of this as well.

185
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,786
It's an exercise,

186
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,725
looking into the water facing the sun.

187
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,493
l want to torment you.

188
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,135
Gentlemen,

189
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,747
who's going to
break into Rothschild's

190
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,613
in Paris, Frankfurt or Stuttgart?

191
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,652
Nobody?

192
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,221
All right,

193
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,924
but we do need money.

194
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,672
My teeth are bad.

195
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:54,242
l know you can't understand me
because I’m mumbling,

196
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,819
and because you are too far away.

197
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,850
Let the Prussian heir
to the throne be punished.

198
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:08,032
He could be captured
after his vacation in Montone.

199
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:13,595
He could be blinded and tortured.

200
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,435
But take care
that he doesn't die too quickly.

201
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,238
But nobody will do it.

202
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:37,058
l, the mock King,
want it that way.

203
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,198
Count Dürckheim,

204
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,775
you have

205
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:55,038
a duel of honour with Prince Arnulf.

206
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,683
You will be promoted

207
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,342
and from today
be my adjutant.

208
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:05,183
Until the end,
do you understand?

209
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,657
Majesty,
l beg of you,

210
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,423
you must be careful of Holnstein.

211
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,589
He is very controversial.

212
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,395
Bismarck drinks nothing
but his wines,

213
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,700
and his trusty Great Dane, Sulte,
is a gift from Holnstein.

214
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:33,207
Let him be.

215
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:37,520
Every court needs its intrigues.

216
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,714
It’s always been so.

217
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:42,819
Lutz,

218
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,635
how much beer do you drink?

219
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:55,600
Two half-litres a day.

220
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,001
Disgusting.

221
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,476
l hate Munich.

222
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,985
l hate this city!

223
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:17,928
I’m a very conservative person.

224
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:21,293
You take it into account
with every sex offender,

225
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,435
predisposition and childhood, l mean.

226
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:29,036
l love the mountains,

227
00:23:29,975 --> 00:23:32,603
the forest air, horses,

228
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,678
Richard Wagner,

229
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,648
Edgar Allan Poe.

230
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,778
l love the night,

231
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,524
the mystic and inexplicable

232
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:52,457
and believe in the immortality of the soul.

233
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:59,629
I’m against the pollution
of the countryside by English industry,

234
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:04,633
against so-called progress,

235
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,005
against the Prussian Empire,

236
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,938
against nationalism,

237
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,517
against socialism

238
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:18,155
and against mass meetings of people.

239
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,729
We'll now go out riding.

240
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:38,205
Tell the princes
to stop shooting in my forests.

241
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:42,643
l want some peace.

242
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:10,273
His eyes are incredibly beautiful.

243
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:13,206
His madness to come
shines out of them.

244
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:13,945
THE BASTARD COUNT HOLNSTEIN
SINGS THE SONG OF BETRAYAL

245
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:17,847
THE BASTARD COUNT HOLNSTEIN
SINGS THE SONG OF BETRAYAL

246
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:22,980
<i>l loved kissing women</i>

247
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:26,885
<i>l didn’t ask permission</i>

248
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:31,461
<i>''Take them,''
l thought to myself</i>

249
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:36,365
l am one of the King's cast-off lovers.

250
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,129
And that's why
he needs me as a guardian.

251
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:42,603
l will be his guardian.
That's how I’ll get my revenge.

252
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:49,004
You must tempt him to build castles,
to run into debt.

253
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,642
Every king falls for that.

254
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:56,378
He believes in
his acquired privileges.

255
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,550
And then the democratic,

256
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,191
legal

257
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:04,227
trap will spring.

258
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,024
And he eats out of your hands,

259
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:09,166
whatever you want.

260
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,502
LEGENDS

261
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:11,867
LEGENDS

262
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:16,640
<i>in the mountains freedom dwells,</i>

263
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:20,801
<i>in the mountains there is beauty,</i>

264
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:25,211
<i>Where King Ludwig’s</i>

265
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:29,479
<i>castles tower</i>

266
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:34,148
<i>Much too soon he had to quit</i>

267
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:38,524
<i>The dearest place of all,</i>

268
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:43,999
<i>Neuschwanstein,
proud fortress,</i>

269
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:47,730
<i>you were the King’s most precious jewel</i>

270
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:04,921
Greetings, friends.

271
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,990
The King!

272
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,626
Still at work so late?

273
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,060
300 florins

274
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:16,291
for my peasants

275
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,669
and a golden watch to boot.

276
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,866
We'll never forget this!

277
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:27,068
We will be
loyal to you forever.

278
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,213
Till death.

279
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,177
They are my subjects.

280
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,651
They are loyal to me.

281
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:41,349
And the American widows,
thanks to Mark Twain.

282
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,129
He spoke of me favourably.

283
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,225
Farewell, friends.

284
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:58,568
<i>With bandages and chloroform</i>

285
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:03,271
<i>They came in person</i>

286
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:09,252
<i>And you had to leave your castle,</i>

287
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:14,019
<i>Which you will never climb again</i>

288
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:29,641
MORBID FEARS:
THE TALE OF ANNA VOGEL, THE PEASANT

289
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:32,804
MORBID FEARS:
THE TALE OF ANNA VOGEL, THE PEASANT

290
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,419
The first time l saw him
was in the dead of night.

291
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:49,283
l can't have been more than eight.

292
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:53,591
l was dragged out of my bed

293
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:58,998
without being told
why l had been wakened.

294
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:05,399
It must have been
something very special.

295
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:12,179
There was tremendous excitement
throughout the whole house.

296
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,555
As nobody bothered about me,

297
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:22,453
l sat by the window

298
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:26,091
and watched the torchlight

299
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:31,702
flickering among the fir trees

300
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,101
and lighting up my room

301
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,265
and casting huge shadows

302
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,776
on the walls.

303
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,712
Suddenly my mother came in

304
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:48,910
and said:

305
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:53,683
''Be a good girl,
the King is driving past.''

306
00:29:56,728 --> 00:30:01,461
It was really him
in his gilded sledge

307
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:06,229
drawn by six horses.

308
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:12,732
A moment later
the procession halted.

309
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:19,278
His arrival cast

310
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,748
such a glow

311
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,914
that our home was illuminated

312
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,582
like the altar of the Blessed Virgin.

313
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:33,697
Our dogs howled and barked.

314
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:40,165
An outrider
banged on our door and shouted:

315
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:43,300
''A glass of water for His Majesty!''

316
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:49,577
My mother looked for a glass

317
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:53,376
but couldn't find one

318
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,418
suitable for the King.

319
00:30:57,288 --> 00:31:03,090
So she took a coffee cup
with a rose pattern

320
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:09,199
which seemed close
to being worthy of His Majesty.

321
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:13,030
She ran to the well,
filled a carafe

322
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:17,163
and carried everything
to the sledge.

323
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:21,768
l was alone in the room,

324
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:24,813
enchanted by the

325
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,645
fantastic sight.

326
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:33,850
The King used to travel in a sledge

327
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:37,153
from the era of Louis XIV.

328
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:41,059
Suddenly l made a decision

329
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:46,101
and walked down the stairs
in my nightgown,

330
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:49,172
with bare feet on the cold floor;

331
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,003
it had been snowing
both day and night.

332
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:57,273
l was entranced
as l stood in front of him.

333
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,882
For me he was an archangel.

334
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:06,022
l only heard the stamping of the steeds,

335
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:09,057
the tinkling of their silver harnesses.

336
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:15,097
The bells on the horses' harnesses
sounded like church bells.

337
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:20,267
The foam-covered beasts
shook their manes.

338
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,635
Atop their heads
plumes of white feathers danced.

339
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:28,643
l was intoxicated
by that magnificent sight.

340
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:34,013
Suddenly l felt dizzy

341
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:36,983
and when l came to myself again,

342
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:41,421
l found myself

343
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,617
next to the King,

344
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:48,255
who looked at me with his big blue eyes,
like in a fairy-tale.

345
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,466
He was still holding the funny cup.

346
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:57,005
He made me drink some water

347
00:32:57,175 --> 00:33:00,110
and kissed me with no more ado.

348
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:05,446
Then he got out
and asked to see the house.

349
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:11,411
<i>Why is It that a woman</i>

350
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,683
<i>should have no love affairs?</i>

351
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,851
<i>No love affairs</i>

352
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:21,055
<i>no love affairs</i>

353
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:24,224
<i>lf she's pretty they will say</i>

354
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:27,371
<i>she's bound to have one anyway,</i>

355
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,234
<i>she's bound to have one anyway</i>

356
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:33,275
<i>lf not it'd be a shame</i>

357
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:41,146
Let the human race fear the gods!

358
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,089
Their eternal hands
hold firm the power,

359
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:52,258
which they can
draw on as they like.

360
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:58,595
Let him whom they raise up
be doubly afraid!

361
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:01,227
On

362
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,068
rocks and clouds

363
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:08,008
seats are prepared around

364
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:13,038
tables of gold.

365
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,392
Battistella.

366
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,322
Battistella.

367
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:55,488
Battistella?

368
00:34:56,194 --> 00:35:00,392
A robber and murderer.
His appeal lies before the King.

369
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,898
A dangerous type,
definitely should be executed.

370
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:09,199
My dear Lutz,
if l know Ludwig

371
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,433
he will not sign.

372
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,670
He is against
any form of bloodshed.

373
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:22,986
l can't...

374
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:27,115
l can't...

375
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,258
l can't stand it any longer,

376
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:36,927
being stared at
by thousands of people.

377
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:41,432
Asking people questions

378
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,907
that don't interest me,

379
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,536
and hearing answers

380
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,577
that have nothing to do with me.

381
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,284
No, no,

382
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:05,054
l can no longer leave my solitude.

383
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,731
Sometimes

384
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,565
when I've read until l am tired

385
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:51,366
and all is quiet

386
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:55,410
l need to hear a human voice.

387
00:36:57,915 --> 00:37:01,851
Then l send
for a lackey or a stable boy

388
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:06,188
to talk to me

389
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:09,190
about his family and his home.

390
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:14,656
Otherwise I’d lose
the habit of speech.

391
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:22,795
l often send them home

392
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,704
so that they can tell me afterwards

393
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:30,069
what the other life outside is like.

394
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:39,316
Descend upon us / O night of love
Give forgetfulness / That I might live.

395
00:37:44,006 --> 00:37:51,569
O sink down

396
00:37:52,109 --> 00:38:00,875
Night of love

397
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:09,430
Give forgetfulness

398
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:17,611
That I might live.

399
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:22,811
Take me up

400
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:30,291
Into your bosom,

401
00:38:35,217 --> 00:38:42,888
Release me from the world!

402
00:38:50,047 --> 00:39:01,500
Extinguished now the last glimmers

403
00:39:02,058 --> 00:39:07,587
What we thought

404
00:39:08,606 --> 00:39:14,843
What we imagined

405
00:39:14,851 --> 00:39:20,864
All thought

406
00:39:21,673 --> 00:39:26,599
All remembering

407
00:39:26,624 --> 00:39:32,792
The glorious presentiment

408
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:39,740
of sacred twilight

409
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:55,073
extinguishes imagined errors...

410
00:39:55,108 --> 00:40:08,520
world-redeeming.

411
00:40:10,668 --> 00:40:14,376
In our bosom...

412
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,604
The young King
is splendid company.

413
00:40:18,783 --> 00:40:22,116
l have never experienced
such an urge to learn

414
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:27,189
and such eagerness to live.

415
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:32,591
At last a love affair
that will not entail torments.

416
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:36,392
Could l give up women completely?

417
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:39,365
A glance at his portrait helps me too.

418
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:42,301
What a delightful boy.

419
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:46,773
Now he is everything to me;
woman, child, the world.

420
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:58,852
TO RICHARD WAGNER:

421
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:01,617
l SHALL RAISE YOU
ABOVE WORLDLY TOIL, MY BELOVED,

422
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:04,317
l SHALL NEVER LEAVE YOU TILL MY DEATH.
LUDWIG

423
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:10,293
This ''Tristan'' will be dreadful.

424
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,129
They'll ban the opera

425
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,101
unless a bad performance
makes a parody of it all.

426
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:19,265
... unless a bad performance
makes a parody of it all.

427
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:23,038
Only a mediocre performance can save me.

428
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,274
Good performances drive people crazy.

429
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,112
It’s the only way.

430
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:32,778
To think that this is what I’ve come to.

431
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:35,187
They say that after the performance...

432
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,159
They say that
after the performance of ''Tristan''

433
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:45,132
he stopped the night train,

434
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,566
got out
and walked through the woods

435
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:51,572
and continued the journey
in the locomotive

436
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:55,143
sitting with the stoker
in front of the open firebox.

437
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:59,608
Where else
could l find such a royal audience?

438
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:04,652
He ordered Cabinet Secretary Pfistermeister
to find me and bring me to him.

439
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:08,223
As the first official act of his government,

440
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:14,297
he ordered Cabinet Secretary Pfistermeister
to find me and bring me to him.

441
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:18,595
Even though
l was an unsuccessful composer

442
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:21,329
and a revolutionary
wanted by the police.

443
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,571
He was 18 at the time.

444
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:28,508
A king
with royal presents for an artist

445
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:33,548
who from now on
was to place his work at the King's service.

446
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,621
Unique,

447
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:20,530
saintly being,

448
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:23,757
what delight,
what perfection!

449
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:28,832
So overcome by rapture!

450
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:35,700
To drown,
to sink,

451
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:37,847
unconscious,

452
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:40,541
ineffable delight.

453
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:47,557
Divine work.

454
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:21,652
ELISABETH, THE EMPRESS OF AUSTRIA,
PRAYS FOR LUDWIG:

455
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:24,450
ELISABETH, THE EMPRESS OF AUSTRIA,
PRAYS FOR LUDWIG:

456
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:28,022
BEWARE, BEWARE,
SOON THE NIGHT WILL FLEE

457
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:33,586
The horizon grows ever darker,
the glaring light of day

458
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:35,664
agonizes unspeakably.

459
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:39,564
Joyfully l give up crown and glory.

460
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:44,501
Often l am shaken

461
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:47,109
with feverish anger

462
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:50,644
and turn away
from an outside world full of wrath.

463
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:53,078
Isn't that understandable?

464
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:58,454
Perhaps I’ll
make my peace with the world

465
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:02,319
when all of my ideals,

466
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:07,396
when their sacred fire
which l carefully feed, has perished.

467
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,657
May that never be.

468
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:17,369
l wish to remain a perpetual mystery
to myself and others.

469
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:22,769
We two,

470
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,907
we can do what we like.

471
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,744
Poor King Ludwig.

472
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:37,785
Perhaps l ought to marry?

473
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,829
Or go to war
under Otto von Bismarck?

474
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,560
A vassal for the cousins of Prussia?

475
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:50,202
Or should l become a democrat,

476
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:52,399
l, the King?

477
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:57,946
Sometimes l think
of Sitting Bull

478
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:02,108
and General Custer
at Little Big Horn.

479
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:03,947
Sitting Bull

480
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:08,023
had no chance either against
the progress of the Christian religion,

481
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:11,457
as his people were massacred.

482
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:16,395
But he had
the sympathy due to a hero

483
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:21,327
in his defeat by railway,
telephone and alcohol.

484
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:25,967
l now take photographs.

485
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:31,210
Also l want
to build a flying machine

486
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:33,906
that can fly me over the Alps.

487
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:38,380
That will also
get me certified as insane later.

488
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:42,558
A flying peacock throne...

489
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:48,692
l have given Wilhelm Bauer,
the inventor of the submarine,

490
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,334
a commission.

491
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,663
He is underestimated.

492
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:59,802
With boats like that
we can defy the Prussian fleet;

493
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,171
we can prevent the world war

494
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:09,047
that will greatly be due to
the German fleet's arrogance.

495
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,816
Shakespeare's fools, too,
were the only sensible people.

496
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,256
Tonight,

497
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:22,398
l dragged my father from his tomb.

498
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:27,667
Tonight, l slapped my father.

499
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:35,137
Tonight,
l threw him down the stairs.

500
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,311
Tonight,

501
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,976
l broke a carafe
over my mother's head!

502
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:46,746
Tonight,

503
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,949
l kicked my mother.

504
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,122
l kicked her in the breasts!

505
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:11,307
On a night like this,

506
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:14,473
l kicked my mother in the breasts.

507
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:18,553
On a night like this,

508
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:26,093
my mother spoiled

509
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:29,824
a performance of ''Lohengrin''
with her chatter.

510
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,036
Now my brother Otto is of age,

511
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:40,074
l can retire to Switzerland,
to Wagner.

512
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:46,038
They can tell the public
I’ve gone out of my mind.

513
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:09,940
MINISTER VON DER PFORTEN TO LUDWIG l

514
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,307
MINISTER VON DER PFORTEN TO LUDWIG l

515
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:17,276
Richard Wagner
received 4,000 florins,

516
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:20,516
and then 8,000.

517
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:26,616
Also, to settle his debts;
another 16,000

518
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,917
and then another 40,000.

519
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,491
Also a villa.

520
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:37,126
70,000 florins as costs for ''Tristan,''

521
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:42,297
29,000 florins
for ''Tannhäuser'' and ''Lohengrin,''

522
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:45,600
''Mastersingers'' 45,800 florins,

523
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:46,936
''Valkyries''

524
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:49,169
41,500 florins.

525
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,509
It’s for art.

526
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:53,979
No, for operas

527
00:50:55,452 --> 00:51:00,082
nobody wants to see.

528
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:03,323
It is not good music.

529
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:05,961
The people don't like this music.

530
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:08,154
They want to see the King.

531
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:10,632
And what does the King do?

532
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,530
He takes trips to the mountains,

533
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:17,036
organizes separate theatre performances

534
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:21,234
just for him.

535
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,211
And he's not even musical.

536
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:34,419
It is incestuous music,

537
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:37,126
Wagner music.

538
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:39,928
Scandalous

539
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,088
and amoral.

540
00:51:47,304 --> 00:51:51,468
My grandson pays it
out of his private purse.

541
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:56,746
The salary of a high court judge

542
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:59,473
is 2,800 florins.

543
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:05,482
That of a teacher,
2,200 florins.

544
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:10,354
That of an assistant secretary,
3,900 florins a year.

545
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:15,625
Take into account
the recent rise in the price of beer

546
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:19,360
and the financial debacle
after the Spitzeder scandal.

547
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,035
But it's for art.

548
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:29,176
Art is the serenest form of existence.

549
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,740
As Brecht says,
or was it Goethe?

550
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:36,086
THE SUN KING OF BAVARIA:
THE VIRGIN KING

551
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,554
THE SUN KING OF BAVARIA:
THE VIRGIN KING

552
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:22,995
l, King

553
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:26,027
by the grace of God.

554
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:14,175
The impossibility of actually falling
is hereby ruled out.

555
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,121
lf there are more kings like this,

556
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,520
soon there won't be any at all.

557
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:33,169
Am l right?

558
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:37,602
Of all the lovely women here
my mother is the loveliest.

559
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:45,246
She receives
what l have yet to give her:

560
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:47,383
love.

561
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:53,013
But she doesn't treat me like a king.

562
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:55,548
l don't like it!

563
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:01,290
l don't like it.

564
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:12,606
Hornig got married.

565
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:16,678
Majesty?

566
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:28,414
Losing him

567
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:33,124
is worse than
the whole Franco-Prussian War.

568
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:35,765
DINER A QUATRE
OR PLEASURE IS A PLEASURE

569
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:39,326
DINER A QUATRE
OR PLEASURE IS A PLEASURE

570
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:04,348
Do you know

571
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:06,716
the valleys of the Hindu Kush?

572
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:08,380
Afghanistan?

573
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:14,285
Wagner should write
his most magnificent opera

574
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:18,192
on an oriental subject.

575
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,107
India and Buddhism

576
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:31,839
have for me something indescribably attractive

577
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:36,146
which evokes pleasure and longing.

578
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:39,412
Intoxication would be complete.

579
00:57:56,105 --> 00:57:58,039
Pleasure

580
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,142
comes from pleasure

581
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,209
and pleasure's

582
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,004
a pleasure.

583
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:10,920
WAXWORKS

584
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,889
WAXWORKS

585
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:17,655
Richard Wagner'll have to go.

586
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:21,589
He disturbs our peace.

587
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:28,326
lf that's the future of art,
we can do without it.

588
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:32,839
l have acquired
some property on Lake Starnberg,

589
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,000
with his help,

590
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:41,175
and I’m interested in
building roads along the lake.

591
00:58:41,985 --> 00:58:45,182
Impossible as long as he's king.

592
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:49,655
The industrialization of Bavaria
is on its way.

593
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:54,160
l need a branch in Berlin
and some Prussian shareholders

594
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,764
under cheap domestic conditions.

595
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,962
The forest will have to go.

596
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:04,231
We need a modern Bavaria.

597
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:07,069
Trees mean too many dead leaves.

598
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:12,442
Besides, the King has the habit of greeting

599
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:16,073
trees and stone columns like people.

600
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:20,120
He chats with invisible people,

601
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:25,728
calling them
Marie Antoinette and Cousin Louis.

602
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:35,863
An art exhibition for Munich
and he refuses

603
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:38,837
because he wants
his peace and quiet.

604
00:59:39,008 --> 00:59:41,533
Exhibitions attract
international royalty

605
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:45,807
and he has to retreat to the mountains
to avoid receiving them. Crazy.

606
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:51,445
Rabbit and dog exhibitions, yes,
but not art like Kaulbach and Piloty.

607
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:55,284
I’m a good monarchist
but l love art, too.

608
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:00,058
He has no manners.

609
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,925
We need progress,

610
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:10,869
our Bavaria,
for roads, for automobiles,

611
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,203
international art,
connection with the Empire,

612
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:15,844
investments.

613
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:19,180
l am a man of the people.

614
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:24,578
lf you do that, gentlemen,

615
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:29,519
do you even know
what this will mean for Bavaria?

616
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:31,683
This death,

617
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:37,093
it must look like a struggle

618
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:41,634
with Prof. Gudden

619
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:46,130
who had tried to hold him back.

620
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:52,979
Get hold of a boat

621
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,447
and four sticks.

622
01:00:55,618 --> 01:01:00,646
Attach the two men's shoes
to the ends

623
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,516
so that you can,

624
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:10,294
from inside the boat
so as not to leave your own imprints,

625
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:14,527
leave imprints
of a struggle in the sand.

626
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:19,198
They will lead to
the spot in the lake

627
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:22,344
that you choose to be

628
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:26,278
the place where His Majesty
breathed his last.

629
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:31,944
His Majesty's damaged clothing

630
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:34,316
must be recovered.

631
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:40,761
The body must be
dressed in undamaged clothes.

632
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:47,828
There must be no witnesses.

633
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:52,366
l hope l have made myself clear.

634
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:59,407
Police records
must be confiscated.

635
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:03,946
We will seize

636
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:07,020
His Majesty's personal archives.

637
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:13,792
Do not forget that no records,

638
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:15,863
no advice,

639
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:19,426
nothing from his architects,

640
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:23,496
no records at all
that could possibly suggest

641
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:28,076
any serious work of Ludwig's
must be made known to the public.

642
01:02:28,644 --> 01:02:31,272
This would destroy his image

643
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:34,541
as a king of kitsch.

644
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:38,213
Ludwig can only remain harmless

645
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:41,083
as a kitsch king.

646
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:44,186
And most important of all,

647
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,625
don't make a martyr of him.

648
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,756
Incidentally,

649
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:54,027
l won't appear at all.

650
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:58,640
l have not said anything.
l have not heard anything.

651
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:04,236
As Prince Regent
in charge of succession,

652
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:09,674
l could easily be suspect.

653
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:25,491
l will withdraw

654
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:30,868
from this twilight of hell

655
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:34,271
and be happy
in the twilight of the gods

656
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:38,577
in the solitude of the mountains.

657
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:42,574
Far from the day,
the hated enemy.

658
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:47,182
Far from the daylight's torrid shine.

659
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:50,917
Far from the profane world of every day,

660
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:53,527
from the hopeless politics

661
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:57,359
which smothers me

662
01:03:57,533 --> 01:04:03,938
and suffocates all poetry.

663
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:21,290
LUDWIG IN THE STUDIO
OF THE SCULPTRESS ELISABETH NEY

664
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:24,817
LUDWIG IN THE STUDIO
OF THE SCULPTRESS ELISABETH NEY

665
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:30,791
Don't make
the horns of the sledge too high

666
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:33,026
or branches will catch on them.

667
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:36,399
Carve cherubs on these horns

668
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:41,600
that can hold the crown, sceptre,
and the other royal regalia,

669
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:44,974
and if at all possible,
the King's robes.

670
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:49,215
The nymphs drawn on the front
shouldn't be holding the lamps,

671
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:52,354
or be the colours of flowers.

672
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:55,820
l want elegant herding scenes
on the sides of the sledge.

673
01:04:55,992 --> 01:05:00,895
Mr. Hofrat should bring
all the copper engravings

674
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:04,396
in the style of Boucher,
Baudoin and...

675
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:09,295
Fragonard with him
to the next meeting.

676
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:15,035
The drapes hanging from the sledge
shouldn't be so pointed.

677
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:18,146
They should be more like scarves

678
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:21,408
and be attached like those
at the Residence Theatre.

679
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:26,283
The triton at the end of the sledge
is too far away from the body.

680
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:30,357
The sledge must
be kept as short as possible.

681
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:36,089
The seat held up by the triton is too high.
It'll detract from the rest.

682
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:39,632
It is not necessary
for the coachman to have a seat.

683
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:42,862
A board to stand on would be sufficient.

684
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,839
Send 42,000 florins

685
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:49,842
to Johann Jakob Mayr.

686
01:05:57,353 --> 01:06:00,584
Words cannot describe my pain.

687
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,694
The old song resounds in my ears.

688
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:18,565
l forgot it
and forgot it without regret,

689
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:21,437
the song
which the Fates sang with horror

690
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:26,172
when Tantalus fell
from his golden throne:

691
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,118
They suffered
with their noble friend;

692
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,884
grim were their hearts
and wild their song.

693
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:40,454
in our youth the nurse sang it to me
and my brothers and sisters.

694
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,027
''Let the human race fear the gods.

695
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:51,605
Their eternal hands
hold firm the power,

696
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:56,141
which they can
draw on as they like.

697
01:06:57,279 --> 01:07:01,579
Let him whom they raise up
be doubly afraid!

698
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:06,109
On rocks and clouds
seats are prepared

699
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:08,952
around tables of gold.''

700
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:16,463
Lola Montez cursed me.

701
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:20,325
She hated the face of my father.

702
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:23,336
l will leave no progeny.

703
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:29,539
She is now
being exhibited in a circus

704
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:33,739
as the King of Bavaria's mistress.

705
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:38,915
''When discord arises,

706
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:45,152
the guests, shamed and insulted,
plunge into depths of darkness

707
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:48,888
and fettered in gloom
await in vain

708
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,397
their just judgement.

709
01:07:52,701 --> 01:07:55,864
But the others remain

710
01:07:56,605 --> 01:08:00,701
at their eternal feasts
at tables of gold.

711
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:05,540
They stride from peak to peak:

712
01:08:05,714 --> 01:08:11,880
From yawning chasms they breathe
the sulphurous breath of the Titans,

713
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:15,081
rising in light clouds

714
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:19,323
like sacrificial smoke.

715
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:25,800
The rulers
turn their indulgent gaze

716
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:28,937
away from whole families

717
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:32,435
to avoid seeing in their descendants

718
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:38,376
the once mutely loved traits

719
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:41,709
of their forbears.''

720
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,849
Do you know what rape is?

721
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,614
Or a bastard son?

722
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:54,556
Women are angels with wings,
aren't they?

723
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:57,164
But you can dream of them as such.

724
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,767
Recite Iphigenia.

725
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,706
''When the heavenly powers

726
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:09,607
assign to a mortal
a life full of changes

727
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:13,479
and prepare for him

728
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,946
changes from joy to sorrow

729
01:09:18,053 --> 01:09:22,319
and sorrow to joy,
a deeply shattering experience:

730
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:26,220
Then they find for him

731
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:31,933
near the town
or on a distant shore

732
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:36,831
to help him
in moments of distress

733
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:39,833
a calm and faithful friend.''

BROTHER OTTO
AND PROF. GUDDEN'S MEDICAL NURSES

735

BROTHER OTTO
AND PROF. GUDDEN'S MEDICAL NURSES

736
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:09,568
I’m Albert,
the court photographer.

737
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:12,764
l have a studio
and over 200 employees.

738
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:18,141
l am going to photograph the King
from his childhood to his deathbed.

739
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:23,146
Attention!

740
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:29,982
Thanks.

741
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:56,774
Otto,

742
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:01,819
what's left
of your cheap pleasures:

743
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:05,994
The ballet, hunting, the army?

744
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:09,062
Only evil memories torture you.

745
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:23,536
They will declare me insane

746
01:11:23,712 --> 01:11:27,409
and make you king
in your lunatic asylum

747
01:11:29,718 --> 01:11:32,881
so that Uncle Luitpold can reign,

748
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:36,589
just as the law dictates,

749
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:41,087
and call it logic

750
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:45,260
since you have already absconded.

751
01:11:51,373 --> 01:11:54,001
Alas,
Shakespeare is no more.

752
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:58,571
l live in vain.

753
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,144
l live in vain.

754
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:27,136
