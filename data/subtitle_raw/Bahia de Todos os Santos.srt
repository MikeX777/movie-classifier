1
00:04:41,103 --> 00:04:43,772
Brazil, a few years ago...

2
00:06:33,938 --> 00:06:36,065
What did you bring?

3
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:38,373
Is it something good?

4
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:40,124
It's a pocket watch.

5
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,868
Made of pure gold.

6
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:45,129
Who did it belong to?

7
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,873
What difference does it make?

8
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,342
It was no use leaving home.

9
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:00,595
It's the same everywhere.

10
00:07:00,928 --> 00:07:03,347
We work hard and achieve nothing.

11
00:07:03,472 --> 00:07:06,851
So? there's always prison
from time to time.

12
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,145
Matias knows this very well!

13
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:13,566
He's stupid enough to
compete at the port.

14
00:07:14,794 --> 00:07:16,444
I'm tired!

15
00:07:17,695 --> 00:07:21,157
If I don't find work soon,
I'll leave this hole!

16
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:24,035
I'll go away and
leave it for you guys.

17
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:29,081
Some people will mock me
for leaving.

18
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,958
Where do you want to go?

19
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,569
At least here
we manage to get by.

20
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:36,964
We? If not for Matias...

21
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:40,184
This is nothing!

22
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,022
Matias is a failure.

23
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:45,056
If we go to the port,
we won't do it like him.

24
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,975
Who would we
steal from, anyway?

25
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:50,019
Everyone here is poor.

26
00:07:50,227 --> 00:07:52,855
There is no work
and everyone knows it.

27
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:57,234
All we can do is
go on living like this.

28
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,362
It's no use going away.

29
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:02,473
Everyone who goes down South
comes back soon.

30
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:04,125
Many people come back every day.

31
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,495
To move to another city
you need a protector.

32
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:09,426
Do you have one?

33
00:08:09,526 --> 00:08:10,548
Do I have what?

34
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:11,999
A colonel?

35
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,303
It wouldn't do me good.

36
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:17,233
Not a colonel, boy.

37
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,715
It could be any big shot from Rio.

38
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,977
The gringo is here!
Don't tell him anything.

39
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:34,981
He doesn't work for us anymore.

40
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,642
I know it's not much, but next time
we'll have silk and cigarettes.

41
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,520
It's guaranteed.

42
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,733
It's getting worse.

43
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,694
I don't know why we're still together.

44
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,989
It would work better if we split up.

45
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:27,867
Each one living as he pleases.

46
00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:51,932
Tonight, all the buyers
will be at the coffee bar.

47
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:53,767
They must come.

48
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:55,277
Did you hear that?

49
00:09:55,352 --> 00:09:57,480
Everyone at
the coffee bar tonight!

50
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,773
You're all going South,
but not now.

51
00:11:43,048 --> 00:11:44,320
Mother Sabina?

52
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,512
That's me. Why?

53
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:46,972
Where are your documents?

54
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:48,182
I don't have any.

55
00:11:48,257 --> 00:11:52,030
You don't need to know how to read
to be aware of the president's decrees.

56
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,555
Even illiterates
know them by heart.

57
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:57,599
African matrix rituals are forbidden!

58
00:11:57,766 --> 00:12:01,061
If you don't obey for your own sake,
you will obey by force!

59
00:13:01,663 --> 00:13:04,907
You should be ashamed of yourselves!

60
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:10,047
Place the dolls
on the sheet. Now lift it.

61
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,759
Now, off to the well!

62
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:27,499
What happened, grandma?

63
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:31,086
They think we should live as they want.

64
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:32,721
They want to end it all.

65
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:34,781
But they can't reach
in here, deep inside.

66
00:14:34,881 --> 00:14:36,842
Is my mother inside?

67
00:14:37,634 --> 00:14:40,304
Don't mind us.

68
00:15:06,997 --> 00:15:08,465
Did they hurt you?

69
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,958
No.

70
00:15:11,835 --> 00:15:14,588
Don't mind us.

71
00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:16,590
Go away.

72
00:15:23,346 --> 00:15:25,807
Your father didn't
belong here either.

73
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,081
The situation there was very bad.

74
00:15:41,156 --> 00:15:43,125
The captain almost
arrested the old woman.

75
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,076
Everyone is afraid of her.

76
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:49,080
If Tonio still lived there he would
have been caught.

77
00:15:50,624 --> 00:15:53,051
It's bad to be registered
by the police.

78
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:55,762
Let's not talk about it
anymore. It's over.

79
00:15:55,837 --> 00:15:58,048
The old woman's
patron saint is strong.

80
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,541
The boy is drunk.

81
00:16:16,024 --> 00:16:17,901
Pour me a cachaça.

82
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:20,746
Have the men arrived yet?

83
00:16:20,821 --> 00:16:23,031
It's about time.

84
00:16:24,449 --> 00:16:26,460
They'd better not
see you like that.

85
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:28,245
Go dance with her.

86
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:30,789
Today of all days...

87
00:16:44,854 --> 00:16:48,038
Enough, Tonio.
Please, stop.

88
00:16:48,288 --> 00:16:50,734
That's why they
don't take us seriously.

89
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,819
To hell, all of them!

90
00:16:52,894 --> 00:16:55,730
They're just customers,
everyone is!

91
00:16:55,855 --> 00:16:56,856
Everyone!

92
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:00,118
My mother.

93
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:01,152
My father.

94
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,408
Who knows where
that bastard is.

95
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:09,703
One day I'll take revenge on him.

96
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:14,374
On second thought,
it's not worth it.

97
00:17:16,227 --> 00:17:18,670
Do you want to
get us in trouble?

98
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,972
You are Sabina's grandson. If someone
hears you, you'll be in trouble.

99
00:17:22,072 --> 00:17:23,425
Whose grandson?

100
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:27,187
Everyone is afraid of her.

101
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:29,231
My mother too, but I'm not!

102
00:17:29,306 --> 00:17:31,766
I've got nothing to do with them.

103
00:17:32,126 --> 00:17:34,728
Sometimes I go
there because of...

104
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,566
I don't even know
why I go there.

105
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,240
Really, why?

106
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,617
Stop it, Tonio.

107
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:53,538
Calm down, I don't exceed my limits.

108
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,216
But mark my words.
One day I will take revenge.

109
00:17:56,291 --> 00:17:58,051
I will start with my father.

110
00:17:58,126 --> 00:17:59,127
Father?

111
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:02,681
Yes, I do have a father!

112
00:18:02,756 --> 00:18:05,383
He does exist and he is white.

113
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:10,096
Look who's back.

114
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,220
Came from São Paulo
for a change of scenery.

115
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,430
Whoever goes South gets rich.

116
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:20,517
He set up a gambling
and prostitution racket.

117
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:24,437
He's got prostitutes
living like princesses.

118
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,649
Treated well and always full of money.

119
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,277
Very different from us here.

120
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,074
The gold pocket watch belonged to him.

121
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,036
They're here!

122
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,248
We are going to dance.

123
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:48,002
Let them take care of business.

124
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,090
What I had to do
today I already did.

125
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,719
Hey! Forget about the business.

126
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,105
We need to get Tonio out of here!

127
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,655
Come with us.
I'll explain everything.

128
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,617
The cops are here!

129
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,655
Let me go!

130
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:47,956
Leave me!

131
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,169
Let me go!

132
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:55,805
Let's go now!

133
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,026
Let me go.
I want to talk to the police!

134
00:21:06,422 --> 00:21:09,122
Don't forget tomorrow morning
we'll deliver some merchandise!

135
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:12,251
Everyone needs to go there to help.

136
00:21:12,351 --> 00:21:14,157
Leave me alone!

137
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,330
I'll take you down South.

138
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,875
Trying to live there
will be the same as here.

139
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,651
Neco doesn't like work...

140
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:37,423
You don't understand.

141
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,849
Let's go somewhere that has work for us,

142
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,968
so you can leave that life.

143
00:21:43,123 --> 00:21:45,395
Do you have the competence for that?

144
00:21:47,478 --> 00:21:48,850
Documents.

145
00:21:57,538 --> 00:21:58,924
I'm a fisherman.

146
00:21:59,572 --> 00:22:01,638
I'm also a fisherman, I work with him.

147
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,242
What about yours?

148
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:00,350
You've been drinking again.

149
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,728
Do you know how long you haven't been here?

150
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:02,816
Good morning, mother.

151
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,702
How are things at the port?

152
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:15,365
Tomorrow there will be
a general workers' strike.

153
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,208
We expect everyone to go,
but you know how people are.

154
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,591
Otherwise there will be no salary increase.

155
00:24:28,472 --> 00:24:29,939
We can't go on like this.

156
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,480
Just look at Luis.

157
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:34,473
All of his children are ill

158
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,892
and the money he has
is not enough to buy food.

159
00:24:37,546 --> 00:24:39,437
We made a list to help them.

160
00:24:39,897 --> 00:24:42,023
At his house everyone is seriously ill.

161
00:24:42,692 --> 00:24:44,734
But will this strike be successful?

162
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:47,409
There's a freighter yet to arrive.

163
00:24:48,075 --> 00:24:50,552
If we don't work,
all the fruits will spoil.

164
00:24:51,285 --> 00:24:53,288
They won't like that.

165
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:01,042
Why hasn't Tonio come over yet?

166
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:03,544
He must be hung over.

167
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,175
Why didn't you take care of him?

168
00:25:09,795 --> 00:25:11,690
There was no way, mother.

169
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,711
Drinking helps sometimes.

170
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:17,349
Just look at the Candomblé house.
The police took everyone out of there.

171
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,944
Tonio doesn't live there with them,

172
00:25:20,207 --> 00:25:22,146
but I think it hurt the same.

173
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,399
It doesn't matter.

174
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,527
Any time soon we'll be leaving here.

175
00:25:35,904 --> 00:25:38,454
This freighter must be bringing
good smuggled products.

176
00:25:39,356 --> 00:25:41,216
It's coming from America.

177
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:42,967
It would be a good deal for them

178
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,502
If it weren't for the strike.

179
00:25:45,061 --> 00:25:46,878
When are we going to the Union?

180
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:48,547
Tomorrow afternoon.

181
00:25:49,058 --> 00:25:52,076
But there is no Union yet.
We're struggling to make one.

182
00:25:52,514 --> 00:25:55,188
You introduce me to the staff
when the ship docks.

183
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,565
As soon as the meeting is over,
we meet at the cafe.

184
00:25:57,906 --> 00:26:00,251
The men that will be there
are the same from last year.

185
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,667
If we're lucky,
it'll be a piece of cake.

186
00:26:02,963 --> 00:26:05,196
But even with the meeting,
will you able to handle it?

187
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:07,524
Yes, but I can't be seen with you.

188
00:26:07,755 --> 00:26:09,985
I'm the one who
puts food on the table.

189
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,822
Do you think Tonio
will get into that?

190
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:15,824
Tonio is not from the party.

191
00:26:16,094 --> 00:26:19,119
Mother, what are you talking about?
Who's in the party?

192
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:23,541
Here we only speak of food.

193
00:26:24,356 --> 00:26:27,169
I'm going to Alice, she has a friend
who is offering me a job.

194
00:26:27,602 --> 00:26:29,864
Did they order another naked woman?

195
00:26:30,311 --> 00:26:32,558
No, this time it's a poster contest.

196
00:26:32,998 --> 00:26:34,662
It's soap advertising.

197
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:37,263
Tell Neco to come up here!

198
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:41,850
He and Alice are always in bed.

199
00:26:50,556 --> 00:26:52,380
Good morning, children.

200
00:26:52,568 --> 00:26:54,455
Neco come up,
they want to talk to you.

201
00:26:54,651 --> 00:26:56,563
There will be a
general strike tomorrow.

202
00:26:56,663 --> 00:26:59,006
There's something to be
solved on an American ship.

203
00:27:03,982 --> 00:27:06,151
It's only going to stir trouble.

204
00:27:10,155 --> 00:27:12,282
You're beautiful, you know?

205
00:27:13,001 --> 00:27:14,159
I manage.

206
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:16,453
When can I see the model?

207
00:27:17,954 --> 00:27:19,748
From that friend of yours.

208
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,676
It's because I'll participate
in a poster contest.

209
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:24,586
But I will only be able to pay you later.

210
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,672
As soon as I win the prize.

211
00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:30,550
How do you know that
you're going to win the prize?

212
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:33,178
Can you see the future?

213
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:05,385
Don't you think this
strike will end badly?

214
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,512
And who told you to
get involved with them?

215
00:28:07,587 --> 00:28:10,257
Just mind your own
business and that's it.

216
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:12,008
And what about you?

217
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,803
Don't fool my friend
with that payment story.

218
00:28:16,096 --> 00:28:17,889
How much is the prize worth?

219
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:19,066
Two bucks.

220
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:21,268
But it is not money that matters.

221
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,603
Come Neco!

222
00:28:25,939 --> 00:28:27,274
I'm coming!

223
00:29:25,624 --> 00:29:28,043
With the ship there,
we can't do anything.

224
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:07,410
Come with me!

225
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:10,997
Pedro!

226
00:32:28,157 --> 00:32:29,891
Go to the beach, hurry!

227
00:35:35,695 --> 00:35:37,870
Let's drink something.

228
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:40,373
I think I need it.

229
00:35:42,416 --> 00:35:44,293
Come, just a drink.

230
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:46,435
We can talk in the meantime.

231
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:06,732
Two beers!

232
00:36:14,686 --> 00:36:16,867
How's your poster going?

233
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:20,162
Alice's model saved me.

234
00:36:29,922 --> 00:36:33,426
Don't you think it would be better
for you to work as an illustrator?

235
00:36:34,081 --> 00:36:36,178
I heard that the salary is good.

236
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:39,515
And if it were in Rio it would be
better than the contest.

237
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,518
They offered me a
place in Rio to study,

238
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:46,105
but I don't want to leave yet.

239
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:49,442
Maybe sometime soon.

240
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:51,986
If I was lucky enough
to get out of here...

241
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:56,282
Who arranged that for you?

242
00:36:56,503 --> 00:36:58,617
It's not a matter of luck.

243
00:36:59,035 --> 00:37:01,287
It was a friend of mine
who works in politics.

244
00:37:02,373 --> 00:37:03,748
But don't tell anyone.

245
00:37:12,513 --> 00:37:14,842
I don't know how to do anything,

246
00:37:17,968 --> 00:37:19,930
not even draw.

247
00:37:21,071 --> 00:37:23,017
The English woman wouldn't say that.

248
00:37:23,968 --> 00:37:25,936
I'm sick of this.

249
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:28,063
So why don't you go to Rio?

250
00:37:28,355 --> 00:37:30,649
There you can get a good job.

251
00:37:31,224 --> 00:37:34,185
If you went there,
you would soon get a job.

252
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,479
With me it would be different.

253
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:40,441
They say that everything is easy,
that everything will work out.

254
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:43,110
But that's not true.

255
00:37:44,007 --> 00:37:45,768
We know how it really is...

256
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,202
Nobody wants anything to be
associated with the strike.

257
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,746
Neither Pedro nor Pitanga.

258
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:56,609
Tomorrow I'll go to Alice's house.

259
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:58,401
To work on the poster.

260
00:38:01,421 --> 00:38:04,131
You will end up
ruining that woman's life.

261
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:07,343
Neco is enough trouble already.

262
00:38:08,076 --> 00:38:10,044
He got her in all sorts of trouble.

263
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:13,766
He's in love, don't you know?

264
00:38:15,288 --> 00:38:16,889
Let's go home.

265
00:38:17,434 --> 00:38:18,821
Wait just a little longer,

266
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,048
After here I'm going to
the English woman's house.

267
00:38:21,357 --> 00:38:23,192
What do you see in her, Tonio?

268
00:38:23,747 --> 00:38:26,488
She has no money, she has nothing.

269
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,179
People think she is wealthy.

270
00:38:32,738 --> 00:38:34,782
She helps me from time to time.

271
00:38:34,907 --> 00:38:36,450
But I'm getting sick of her.

272
00:38:38,035 --> 00:38:40,704
She likes my color.

273
00:38:41,372 --> 00:38:45,543
They despise and loathe us,
but in bed, we're good enough.

274
00:38:45,811 --> 00:38:48,879
Every white woman says
it's to help us, to save us.

275
00:38:51,266 --> 00:38:53,759
The English woman always says that.

276
00:38:56,416 --> 00:39:00,349
You wouldn't understand, you're white.

277
00:39:00,986 --> 00:39:03,110
With me it's the opposite.

278
00:39:03,185 --> 00:39:05,688
They want me because I'm white.

279
00:39:06,146 --> 00:39:07,772
It's always like that.

280
00:39:07,872 --> 00:39:10,978
Wasn't it the same thing between
your father and your mother?

281
00:39:11,078 --> 00:39:13,348
This talk of color is nonsense.

282
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:54,659
This place would be better
if everyone collaborated.

283
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:57,516
They no longer respect anything.

284
00:40:57,591 --> 00:41:00,427
These scumbags have even
forgotten about Christ.

285
00:41:00,878 --> 00:41:03,897
And the children will be even
worse than the parents.

286
00:41:03,972 --> 00:41:05,390
Parasite scum!

287
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:10,178
They want to be the boss
without working. Poor country.

288
00:41:12,773 --> 00:41:15,743
I'm talking to you! Listen up!

289
00:41:15,818 --> 00:41:17,494
You will stay here for a month.

290
00:41:17,569 --> 00:41:21,198
If you make a fuss I'll hand you over
to the federal authorities!

291
00:41:21,365 --> 00:41:24,535
If you have common sense and speak up,
we'll fix you up!

292
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:27,037
This country will be straightened out!

293
00:41:27,496 --> 00:41:29,832
Five dockworkers are hidden!

294
00:41:29,915 --> 00:41:32,501
They're agitators on the run!

295
00:41:32,835 --> 00:41:37,422
I want to see their names tonight and
we'll see which one of you has brains!

296
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,556
Another strike...

297
00:41:47,307 --> 00:41:48,942
Just what we needed.

298
00:41:49,017 --> 00:41:51,645
And now even dead bodies.

299
00:41:52,104 --> 00:41:53,689
You're looking sad.

300
00:41:55,941 --> 00:41:57,910
A letter arrived from London.

301
00:41:57,985 --> 00:42:00,028
I'm so fond of Jennifer.

302
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,957
We got married almost at the same time.

303
00:42:04,032 --> 00:42:05,576
Her husband was a fire chief.

304
00:42:09,496 --> 00:42:11,498
Funny, isn't it?

305
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:15,335
Poor thing, he died so tragically.

306
00:42:16,253 --> 00:42:19,881
She was so shaken that Peter and I
invited her to stay with us.

307
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:24,261
That way she would be distracted, you know.

308
00:42:25,721 --> 00:42:28,307
I was still living with Peter at the time.

309
00:42:28,785 --> 00:42:31,405
We helped her because she
was in a financial crisis.

310
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:36,444
In those days,Peter would agree with
everything I suggested.

311
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:41,947
Poor little thing, she was so shaken
by her husband's death.

312
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,739
She's your type.

313
00:42:45,657 --> 00:42:47,876
But she quickly forgot
about her poor husband.

314
00:42:47,951 --> 00:42:49,745
You should have seen that.

315
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,012
You know how those women are...

316
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:54,416
It's hard to find one that is sincere.

317
00:42:55,751 --> 00:42:57,928
Jennifer continued to live with us.

318
00:42:58,003 --> 00:43:00,213
And one night
while we were sleeping...

319
00:43:08,483 --> 00:43:10,790
Peter didn't hear a thing,
he slept very deeply.

320
00:43:11,475 --> 00:43:14,509
She brought all kinds of people over.
Even sailors.

321
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:18,398
Naturally, I never told Peter anything.

322
00:43:19,316 --> 00:43:20,901
If he even suspected...

323
00:43:21,735 --> 00:43:24,529
Sometimes, from my bed,
I'd hear footsteps. And voices.

324
00:43:26,281 --> 00:43:28,742
Tonio, are you distracted?

325
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:29,777
Yes!

326
00:43:30,412 --> 00:43:32,645
Listen, there was money in my pocket
and now it's missing.

327
00:43:32,745 --> 00:43:34,653
I'll go to the police
and you will be a witness.

328
00:43:35,258 --> 00:43:37,420
Don't be an idiot,
I took the money!

329
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,915
I needed the money.

330
00:43:39,015 --> 00:43:40,629
Five bucks?

331
00:43:51,723 --> 00:43:55,227
If you sleep here on Saturday,
we could go on a trip in the morning.

332
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:05,112
It's no use pouting!

333
00:44:05,612 --> 00:44:07,489
No one's to blame!

334
00:44:07,614 --> 00:44:09,958
Didn't we have to steal to eat?

335
00:44:10,033 --> 00:44:11,576
Am I telling any lies?

336
00:44:16,596 --> 00:44:18,667
What will become of us without Pedro?

337
00:44:21,211 --> 00:44:23,853
I will not be able
to provide for our home.

338
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:28,351
Talk and talk, but when it comes
to leaving this place

339
00:44:28,426 --> 00:44:29,853
nobody has the courage!

340
00:44:29,928 --> 00:44:31,429
Where's the courage now?

341
00:44:32,389 --> 00:44:34,683
Is there anything holding us here?

342
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:46,306
The dockers are hidden
in the Candomblé house.

343
00:44:46,406 --> 00:44:49,614
They'll go into the woods,
to catch the midnight freight train.

344
00:44:49,698 --> 00:44:52,117
The train will stop
near the slaughterhouse.

345
00:45:01,784 --> 00:45:03,712
You're going with them.

346
00:45:08,491 --> 00:45:10,594
Mother, this is my salvation!

347
00:45:12,112 --> 00:45:13,847
Who arranged this?

348
00:45:14,055 --> 00:45:15,948
Don't you worry.

349
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:18,518
Go away and leave the rest
for us to take care of.

350
00:45:19,102 --> 00:45:20,604
Go away!

351
00:45:20,996 --> 00:45:24,107
Here you won't ever achieve anything!

352
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:28,653
You're useless, even with our help.

353
00:45:30,071 --> 00:45:31,740
Aren't you so smart?

354
00:45:32,401 --> 00:45:35,835
You better go, that way you'll solve
your problems and that's it.

355
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:37,495
No one here is smart!

356
00:45:37,579 --> 00:45:39,014
I just need to get out of here!

357
00:45:39,114 --> 00:45:40,720
Why don't you go as well?
Who's holding you back?

358
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,775
Nobody!

359
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:42,884
So shut your mouth!

360
00:45:42,959 --> 00:45:44,553
No need to shout.

361
00:45:45,045 --> 00:45:46,888
Shouting will do no good.

362
00:45:46,963 --> 00:45:50,175
You know I could have
left if I wanted to.

363
00:45:51,979 --> 00:45:55,347
I didn't leave because I didn't
want to leave everything.

364
00:45:57,711 --> 00:46:00,235
But I will learn to live by myself.

365
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:01,861
Get out of here!

366
00:46:01,936 --> 00:46:03,104
Scoundrel!

367
00:47:52,338 --> 00:47:54,390
The train will stop
at five in the morning.

368
00:47:54,465 --> 00:47:57,143
You'll have to climb on it quickly,
in the last train car.

369
00:47:57,218 --> 00:47:59,585
Ten minutes before passing in Monte Azul,

370
00:47:59,685 --> 00:48:02,557
The train will slow down
and you'll have to jump.

371
00:48:05,351 --> 00:48:06,936
May God be with you.

372
00:51:30,806 --> 00:51:32,464
Two cups of coffee.

373
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,988
What a beautiful day.

374
00:52:32,576 --> 00:52:34,453
At least close the door!

375
00:52:34,704 --> 00:52:37,081
Leave it open, Tonio is coming up.

376
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:50,083
Can I sleep here?

377
00:52:52,601 --> 00:52:53,799
Of course.

378
00:54:26,915 --> 00:54:28,692
Did you read the newspapers?

379
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:31,612
These people...

380
00:54:32,821 --> 00:54:35,199
They will all be caught, you'll see.

381
00:54:37,034 --> 00:54:38,160
Murderers...

382
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:43,540
Instead of laying low,
they prefer to fool around.

383
00:54:49,224 --> 00:54:51,246
Thankfully the train
driver told on them.

384
00:54:51,346 --> 00:54:54,176
Imagine if they got away...

385
00:54:56,567 --> 00:54:58,389
At least the driver is honest.

386
00:54:58,472 --> 00:55:00,432
Which reminds me of Europe.

387
00:55:01,308 --> 00:55:02,309
Enough!

388
00:55:03,074 --> 00:55:05,004
And they haven't found
everything out yet.

389
00:55:05,104 --> 00:55:08,115
They are looking for
whoever helped them escape.

390
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:10,067
If only I wasn't a foreigner...

391
00:55:32,048 --> 00:55:34,341
Do you want to go to the
same hotel as last time?

392
00:55:35,446 --> 00:55:36,952
What are you thinking about?

393
00:55:37,052 --> 00:55:38,303
Nothing!

394
00:55:38,762 --> 00:55:40,397
I don't feel like talking.

395
00:55:40,706 --> 00:55:42,110
Are you crazy?

396
00:56:20,596 --> 00:56:23,190
You've arrived, miss.
Is it too hot in Bahia?

397
00:56:23,265 --> 00:56:24,725
Very!

398
00:56:28,169 --> 00:56:29,376
Room eleven.

399
00:56:46,163 --> 00:56:47,939
How long are we staying here?

400
00:56:47,965 --> 00:56:49,633
We're going to stay here for a week.

401
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:51,775
But if you want to,
we can go back sooner.

402
00:57:11,685 --> 00:57:13,991
Nice way to show your gratitude!

403
00:57:14,066 --> 00:57:15,776
I took you off the streets.

404
00:57:17,497 --> 00:57:19,071
And that's what I get.

405
00:57:24,201 --> 00:57:25,460
Where are you going?

406
00:57:25,535 --> 00:57:26,870
I'm going to take a walk.

407
00:58:10,883 --> 00:58:13,244
When I think of my homeland,
I miss it so much.

408
00:58:15,252 --> 00:58:17,546
Tonio, we could get along better.

409
00:58:17,921 --> 00:58:19,840
We could have fun.

410
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:22,092
What's missing for you?

411
00:58:23,301 --> 00:58:25,053
I already did everything I could.

412
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:30,517
Do you think a person
can live like this?

413
00:58:32,793 --> 00:58:34,646
You hate me, don't you?

414
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,960
You have no heart.

415
00:58:39,285 --> 00:58:43,071
When I first met you I immediately
opened up my house to you.

416
00:58:43,362 --> 00:58:45,605
It has nothing to do with love.

417
00:58:45,705 --> 00:58:48,066
I thought we could understand
each other better.

418
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:50,704
I thought you didn't
have anyone else either.

419
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,415
What's going on in your head?

420
00:58:56,710 --> 00:58:59,379
What you really like
is life on the streets.

421
00:59:00,088 --> 00:59:02,966
Tonio, you're an unhappy
person and you know it.

422
00:59:04,608 --> 00:59:06,602
if I could live alone...

423
00:59:07,872 --> 00:59:11,558
If you were another person,
things could be better.

424
00:59:12,726 --> 00:59:15,353
It was foolish of me
to get you out of the mud.

425
00:59:32,871 --> 00:59:34,423
Finish that beer right away.

426
00:59:34,498 --> 00:59:36,754
Can't you see that people are staring?

427
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:42,459
Have you paid for it?

428
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:48,804
These Negroes...

429
01:00:32,514 --> 01:00:34,766
Are you sleepy?

430
01:00:36,309 --> 01:00:38,069
I've already told you, I'm tired!

431
01:00:38,144 --> 01:00:40,030
Tired of the trip?

432
01:00:40,105 --> 01:00:42,148
One can't always stay in Bahia.

433
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:46,215
Even if you could be with me every night,
I couldn't stand being there all year.

434
01:00:56,579 --> 01:00:58,164
I think I'm going away.

435
01:00:59,279 --> 01:01:00,690
What will you do?

436
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,587
I'm going to São Paulo.

437
01:01:03,545 --> 01:01:05,453
Everyone wants to get out of here.

438
01:01:07,215 --> 01:01:08,767
When are you going?

439
01:01:08,842 --> 01:01:09,801
Soon.

440
01:01:10,468 --> 01:01:12,877
I won't see those people
you don't like anymore.

441
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:17,609
You know I can't go to
São Paulo right now.

442
01:01:17,684 --> 01:01:19,728
And how would you go without me?

443
01:01:21,513 --> 01:01:23,104
I don't need you!

444
01:01:24,383 --> 01:01:26,276
You don't need me?

445
01:01:26,526 --> 01:01:27,986
Easier said than done.

446
01:01:28,069 --> 01:01:30,651
What about the money you
took out of my pocket?

447
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:32,730
I can see how you don't need me.

448
01:01:33,486 --> 01:01:35,577
That money wasn't for me!

449
01:01:36,745 --> 01:01:38,255
So who was it for?

450
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:39,998
It's no use in talking about it.

451
01:01:40,098 --> 01:01:42,333
You wouldn't be able to understand.

452
01:01:42,915 --> 01:01:45,195
You think I don't
know what it was for.

453
01:01:45,633 --> 01:01:47,630
If you're curious,
I'll tell you now.

454
01:01:50,508 --> 01:01:54,137
Sleep peacefully,
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

455
01:01:56,181 --> 01:01:58,183
If they arrested you,
what would become of me?

456
01:02:00,226 --> 01:02:03,196
But I should turn you in.
You deserve it.

457
01:02:03,271 --> 01:02:05,982
Acknowledge that it was foolish to
try and help those people.

458
01:02:14,908 --> 01:02:17,285
You're just inconsequential.

459
01:02:22,707 --> 01:02:25,877
You are not a communist,
so why did you join them?

460
01:02:27,712 --> 01:02:29,990
You know as well as I do
that they are against the law.

461
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:31,628
Which law?

462
01:02:33,009 --> 01:02:35,595
Look, even if you don't
want it to, the law exists.

463
01:02:38,621 --> 01:02:41,351
Come here, give me
a kiss before bed.

464
01:02:41,601 --> 01:02:43,436
Leave me alone!

465
01:02:44,687 --> 01:02:46,689
I want you, come here!

466
01:02:50,693 --> 01:02:53,905
You're nothing but
a nasty black.

467
01:02:53,988 --> 01:02:55,065
You!

468
01:03:10,463 --> 01:03:12,382
Don't let him out!

469
01:05:54,669 --> 01:05:56,921
Hey! Put that shirt on!

470
01:06:50,433 --> 01:06:52,435
Where have you been?

471
01:06:52,643 --> 01:06:55,688
I already made up my mind,
I'm going to São Paulo.

472
01:06:56,147 --> 01:06:57,865
I could help you.

473
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,931
I don't want to
talk about it anymore.

474
01:07:28,735 --> 01:07:30,139
Hey!

475
01:07:30,931 --> 01:07:34,310
The water is great, come on in!

476
01:07:49,784 --> 01:07:51,544
Where have you been?

477
01:07:51,619 --> 01:07:52,801
Traveling.

478
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:55,539
I broke up with the
English woman and came back.

479
01:07:58,042 --> 01:08:00,044
I decided that I'm going to São Paulo.

480
01:08:01,921 --> 01:08:06,008
This is so good, especially
after that hellish trip.

481
01:08:10,429 --> 01:08:14,442
Tonight we're going
to the gafieira dance.

482
01:08:14,517 --> 01:08:16,068
Everyone will be there.

483
01:08:16,143 --> 01:08:17,611
You're coming too!

484
01:08:17,686 --> 01:08:22,775
Tonight I'm paying for everything!
I'm rich!

485
01:08:22,983 --> 01:08:24,360
How come?

486
01:08:32,701 --> 01:08:34,286
Who is the girl you're taking?

487
01:08:34,412 --> 01:08:36,622
She's sixteen. She works
as a maid in Canela.

488
01:08:36,705 --> 01:08:38,299
Is she still a damsel?

489
01:08:38,374 --> 01:08:40,918
I don't know.

490
01:08:44,047 --> 01:08:45,756
Hey, Matias!

491
01:08:47,981 --> 01:08:49,927
Tonio left the English woman.

492
01:08:57,393 --> 01:09:00,279
So many people are looking
for a woman like that,

493
01:09:00,354 --> 01:09:03,365
And you just let her go.

494
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,199
Tonight we won't talk about business.

495
01:09:05,299 --> 01:09:06,652
He is rich.

496
01:09:06,752 --> 01:09:08,853
Let's all go to the dance,
I'm paying.

497
01:09:08,953 --> 01:09:10,698
The girl is coming too.

498
01:10:17,389 --> 01:10:18,390
Tonio!

499
01:10:19,016 --> 01:10:21,101
Don't come after me, please.

500
01:10:21,226 --> 01:10:23,187
You will regret it.

501
01:11:06,939 --> 01:11:08,949
Tonio, it's the girl.

502
01:11:09,024 --> 01:11:10,943
Hey, Manuel!

503
01:11:11,995 --> 01:11:13,737
Why hasn't she come in yet?

504
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:17,078
Get in there,
I'll be going in a minute.

505
01:11:52,958 --> 01:11:55,529
I'm sorry Manuel,
I couldn't come up.

506
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:56,655
Why?

507
01:11:57,057 --> 01:12:00,909
I'm not feeling very well.

508
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:03,962
Come, I want to
introduce you to my friends.

509
01:12:04,037 --> 01:12:05,873
You're going to like them.

510
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:08,069
No. I'm tired, Manuel.

511
01:12:08,169 --> 01:12:09,793
Please, come with me.

512
01:12:10,836 --> 01:12:12,629
I already told you,
I'm not coming.

513
01:12:24,433 --> 01:12:27,821
Look, I'm not feeling very well
because I'm pregnant.

514
01:12:33,741 --> 01:12:35,452
Don't be so sad.

515
01:12:35,527 --> 01:12:37,446
You have no obligation.

516
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:40,407
We are not engaged or anything.

517
01:12:43,327 --> 01:12:46,538
I've been like this for three
months, before I met you.

518
01:13:07,809 --> 01:13:09,987
Tonight, I'm paying!
Is Manuel out there?

519
01:13:10,062 --> 01:13:11,313
We didn't see him.

520
01:13:11,833 --> 01:13:14,241
I think his girl didn't
want to come out.

521
01:13:14,316 --> 01:13:15,589
How are you?

522
01:13:15,786 --> 01:13:18,233
Long time no see.
What have you been up to?

523
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:19,947
Just traveling a bit.

524
01:13:20,322 --> 01:13:21,792
Right...

525
01:13:45,514 --> 01:13:47,099
Night shift.

526
01:13:49,184 --> 01:13:50,310
Wait a second.

527
01:13:51,478 --> 01:13:52,896
It's a foreigner.

528
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:56,544
I think she has some information
about the workers strike.

529
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:18,547
Pay attention to Neco.

530
01:14:18,672 --> 01:14:20,382
Be careful, he might find out.

531
01:14:20,465 --> 01:14:21,967
I'll take care of it.

532
01:14:22,551 --> 01:14:24,386
Neco is the one I like.

533
01:14:24,469 --> 01:14:27,180
I only go with Matias
to pass the time.

534
01:14:32,352 --> 01:14:35,522
Now and then we need an older man.

535
01:14:45,574 --> 01:14:48,335
We are angels compared
to these people.

536
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:49,995
Look at that girl over there.

537
01:14:50,287 --> 01:14:52,247
I bet you she wants to go down South.

538
01:14:52,497 --> 01:14:54,841
They say that women are victims.

539
01:14:54,916 --> 01:14:58,494
You just have to offer something and
they'll do whatever we want.

540
01:15:02,848 --> 01:15:06,344
Do you think I'll be tied to someone?

541
01:15:06,666 --> 01:15:09,723
I just want to have fun.

542
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:12,726
I'm not a child.

543
01:15:13,301 --> 01:15:16,813
I know these men very well.

544
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,395
What is it?

545
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,991
Go home. I need to tell Sabina
about what happened.

546
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:10,852
Let me go, you know
Tonio is underage.

547
01:17:10,927 --> 01:17:12,846
I'm glad that's none of our business.

548
01:17:14,931 --> 01:17:16,307
It can get worse.

549
01:17:18,725 --> 01:17:21,312
Don't worry, I'll take you home.

550
01:18:07,239 --> 01:18:10,662
It's not the first time your
family has given us trouble,

551
01:18:10,737 --> 01:18:12,780
but this was the worst of all.

552
01:18:14,697 --> 01:18:19,412
I know you don't care about the
laws that we respect

553
01:18:19,687 --> 01:18:22,490
and use to maintain social order.

554
01:18:23,443 --> 01:18:25,260
I want to warn you.

555
01:18:25,969 --> 01:18:30,381
Your grandson is involved with the strike.
A serious offense, according to our laws.

556
01:18:30,922 --> 01:18:32,634
Do you understand that?

557
01:18:33,726 --> 01:18:36,387
He ran away when he was little.

558
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:40,892
I have nothing to do
with him and his life.

559
01:18:42,225 --> 01:18:45,238
Instead of doing rituals,

560
01:18:45,313 --> 01:18:48,525
You should take better
care of your family.

561
01:18:49,602 --> 01:18:53,696
At your age you should
have some common sense.

562
01:18:54,113 --> 01:18:57,367
It was my daughter who
gave birth to him, not me.

563
01:18:57,708 --> 01:19:00,378
Since the child was born,
I never saw her again.

564
01:19:00,453 --> 01:19:02,664
She's been ill for many years.

565
01:19:03,422 --> 01:19:05,884
So you are the only one responsible

566
01:19:05,959 --> 01:19:08,461
And you know this as well as I do.

567
01:19:09,189 --> 01:19:11,681
His father disappeared many years ago, right?

568
01:19:11,756 --> 01:19:13,091
Yes, sir.

569
01:19:14,717 --> 01:19:17,011
Have you heard from him since?

570
01:19:21,601 --> 01:19:24,310
What does your grandson do for a living?

571
01:19:24,394 --> 01:19:27,063
I hope you know that at least!

572
01:19:27,163 --> 01:19:29,760
I think he works. How would I know?

573
01:19:29,939 --> 01:19:31,784
He never came home.

574
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:33,403
Listen, lady.

575
01:19:34,445 --> 01:19:37,164
This country already
gives us many problems.

576
01:19:37,264 --> 01:19:41,286
Few people are concerned with the
progress of this land.

577
01:19:41,671 --> 01:19:45,569
You look like victims,
but you are parasites.

578
01:19:49,419 --> 01:19:50,620
In any case,

579
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:54,549
he will remain
here for a few days.

580
01:19:54,649 --> 01:20:00,013
I just want to know the whereabouts
of the agitators he helped get away.

581
01:20:00,502 --> 01:20:05,193
If he cooperates, we'll
leave him to your care.

582
01:20:05,268 --> 01:20:07,353
Since your daughter is incapable.

583
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:13,735
In which case you are officially
responsible for him!

584
01:20:23,953 --> 01:20:25,371
Get up!

585
01:20:32,628 --> 01:20:34,005
Follow me!

586
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:11,918
Listen boy, there's no time!

587
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:15,004
You're a minor.

588
01:21:15,466 --> 01:21:18,716
Otherwise, you'd already be in jail.

589
01:21:19,217 --> 01:21:20,935
Your grandmother was here

590
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:25,473
and said she doesn't know
anything about your life.

591
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:30,987
You will be delivered to her
within a month.

592
01:21:31,062 --> 01:21:33,377
But only if you talk.

593
01:21:33,477 --> 01:21:37,647
If you don't talk you'll stay here
until we find those scumbags.

594
01:21:38,630 --> 01:21:41,584
In that case, you'll
go to a reformatory.

595
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:43,366
Let's go!

596
01:21:43,466 --> 01:21:45,418
Spill the beans!

597
01:21:45,493 --> 01:21:47,044
How did that escape happen?

598
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:48,870
Speak at once!

599
01:21:48,871 --> 01:21:50,248
What can I say?

600
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,750
I don't know anything!

601
01:21:53,709 --> 01:21:55,453
Why did you arrest me?

602
01:21:55,553 --> 01:21:57,747
Don't play a fool.

603
01:21:58,297 --> 01:22:00,383
I'll refresh your memory.

604
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:04,971
First, you stole five bucks.

605
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:09,225
Want me to remind you from whom?

606
01:22:11,410 --> 01:22:16,610
It was used to help in the escape
of the murderers of a poor soldier!

607
01:22:17,817 --> 01:22:20,691
You have plenty of imagination.

608
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:26,242
You forgot that by helping them,
you endanger the lives of innocents.

609
01:22:27,326 --> 01:22:29,741
People who don't care
about strikes.

610
01:22:29,841 --> 01:22:32,423
People who don't
need strikes!

611
01:22:32,498 --> 01:22:34,500
I don't know anything!

612
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:38,045
Speak now, or
regret it later!

613
01:22:41,249 --> 01:22:43,884
I will not tell on anyone!

614
01:22:44,010 --> 01:22:46,554
This one wants to be a martyr...

615
01:22:54,895 --> 01:22:56,647
This will be bad for everyone.

616
01:22:57,189 --> 01:22:58,190
No doubt.

617
01:23:00,151 --> 01:23:03,436
When the cops went in the club,
everyone knew it was about the strike.

618
01:23:03,996 --> 01:23:06,491
This is no laughing matter.

619
01:23:07,408 --> 01:23:08,784
That boy...

620
01:23:08,993 --> 01:23:10,503
Have some manners, woman!

621
01:23:10,578 --> 01:23:12,046
What can we do?

622
01:23:12,121 --> 01:23:14,131
Wait for him to be released.

623
01:23:14,206 --> 01:23:16,167
Do you want more trouble?

624
01:23:16,625 --> 01:23:18,219
I hope it doesn't escalate.

625
01:23:18,294 --> 01:23:20,137
I spoke to Sabina yesterday.

626
01:23:20,212 --> 01:23:22,515
She said she doesn't
know anything about it.

627
01:23:22,765 --> 01:23:25,510
Tonio is a minor,
but he's never lived at home.

628
01:23:26,135 --> 01:23:27,970
We have to do something.

629
01:23:29,305 --> 01:23:30,690
Wait...

630
01:23:30,765 --> 01:23:32,767
What about Crispim's friend?
The politician.

631
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:34,604
What?

632
01:23:34,704 --> 01:23:38,397
You think an influential
person will get involved in this?

633
01:23:38,606 --> 01:23:40,689
Involved with communists, no less!?

634
01:23:40,789 --> 01:23:41,850
You're insane.

635
01:23:42,263 --> 01:23:44,038
Tonio is not a communist!

636
01:23:44,138 --> 01:23:46,322
I know you, Manuel.

637
01:23:46,667 --> 01:23:49,000
You're not going to get us into this.

638
01:23:49,075 --> 01:23:51,368
This is Tonio's business.
Let him handle it.

639
01:23:51,577 --> 01:23:54,605
You know very well that we
are all compromised here.

640
01:23:54,705 --> 01:23:56,999
Your good will might
get us in trouble.

641
01:24:11,834 --> 01:24:15,178
What a surprise! Come in.

642
01:24:22,689 --> 01:24:23,901
Take a seat.

643
01:24:31,450 --> 01:24:33,244
I'm going to Rio.

644
01:24:33,744 --> 01:24:35,329
I'm going to study there.

645
01:24:37,623 --> 01:24:39,834
In the meantime
I have to finish this poster.

646
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,629
It's not for the prize,
but for satisfaction.

647
01:24:44,088 --> 01:24:46,715
It must be difficult
to enter the Academy.

648
01:24:47,258 --> 01:24:50,094
But with a big shot
it should be easier, right?

649
01:24:53,141 --> 01:24:54,956
It cost me a little, but I did it.

650
01:25:05,999 --> 01:25:09,071
Did you know Tonio was arrested
because of the dockers' escape?

651
01:25:11,323 --> 01:25:13,367
It was bound to happen.

652
01:25:13,659 --> 01:25:15,619
But Tonio of all people...

653
01:25:16,483 --> 01:25:18,831
You liked him the most, right?

654
01:25:19,790 --> 01:25:21,208
Yes.

655
01:25:23,836 --> 01:25:26,005
If only we could lend him a hand...

656
01:25:26,255 --> 01:25:29,049
He might end up in a reformatory.

657
01:25:30,384 --> 01:25:32,886
If you came to ask for favors,
I'm sorry.

658
01:25:34,179 --> 01:25:36,974
I would like to help, but
I can't get mixed in that.

659
01:25:37,558 --> 01:25:39,360
Especially with politics involved.

660
01:25:39,435 --> 01:25:40,978
Politics?

661
01:25:41,228 --> 01:25:43,314
Don't play stupid.

662
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:47,526
Why would I take that risk for
someone who never helped me?

663
01:25:47,878 --> 01:25:51,363
Nobody helped me when Pitanga
expelled me from the group.

664
01:25:52,251 --> 01:25:53,771
Remember?

665
01:25:55,264 --> 01:25:57,244
And that would be
easy to solve.

666
01:26:00,272 --> 01:26:03,849
Now, with police trouble,
word gets around fast.

667
01:26:05,597 --> 01:26:10,257
Everyone should
lay low for now.

668
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:14,932
Don't forget I am a minor.

669
01:26:15,987 --> 01:26:17,973
And I don't live with my family.

670
01:26:21,616 --> 01:26:23,395
When are you going to Rio?

671
01:26:23,979 --> 01:26:24,980
Soon.

672
01:26:26,899 --> 01:26:28,984
But I'll keep this house intact.

673
01:26:30,986 --> 01:26:33,197
I can't bring myself to do it.
It's so beautiful.

674
01:26:36,732 --> 01:26:39,616
Why don't you stay for coffee?

675
01:28:08,051 --> 01:28:10,085
Can we live here?

676
01:28:11,127 --> 01:28:14,131
What would that be like?

677
01:28:46,413 --> 01:28:49,541
I can stay at my employers' house
until the child is born.

678
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:53,211
After that, I already
told them I'm leaving.

679
01:28:53,972 --> 01:28:56,214
And I can work.

680
01:28:56,340 --> 01:28:59,885
Me too. But I want to live here.

681
01:29:24,284 --> 01:29:25,961
Wait Neco, wait!
Don't do this!

682
01:29:26,036 --> 01:29:27,454
Go back inside, woman!

683
01:29:28,354 --> 01:29:29,790
My goodness!

684
01:29:31,153 --> 01:29:32,718
Neco! Neco!

685
01:29:32,793 --> 01:29:35,595
Now you'll learn not to mess with
other people's wives! Scumbag!

686
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:37,798
Get out, before I thrash you!

687
01:29:40,622 --> 01:29:42,344
What's happened, Matias?

688
01:29:48,442 --> 01:29:51,445
I'm done!
I'm going away. By myself!

689
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,655
What's the use of
having a woman?

690
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:55,816
There's nothing else
to keep me here.

691
01:29:56,525 --> 01:29:59,244
I stayed because of her,
because I liked her!

692
01:29:59,319 --> 01:30:02,748
Whenever I wanted to leave,
she'd beg, "No! No..."

693
01:30:02,823 --> 01:30:05,250
Now I know why she
wanted to stay.

694
01:30:05,325 --> 01:30:06,952
I found them both in that bed!

695
01:30:07,911 --> 01:30:10,497
It was not because of him.

696
01:30:10,997 --> 01:30:13,041
I don't care about Matias.

697
01:30:14,251 --> 01:30:17,087
I like him. Don't you see?

698
01:30:22,828 --> 01:30:25,220
Love is nonsense!

699
01:30:29,808 --> 01:30:31,601
What am I going to do now?

700
01:30:40,112 --> 01:30:41,319
Telegram.

701
01:30:56,708 --> 01:30:58,649
What shall we answer?

702
01:31:00,255 --> 01:31:03,341
Send everyone to the inquiry
five days from now.

703
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:15,214
They have arrested
the agitators at the border.

704
01:31:15,314 --> 01:31:18,907
The country may be large,
but it doesn't hide bandits.

705
01:33:25,108 --> 01:33:27,527
Hello, how are you?

706
01:33:28,653 --> 01:33:30,205
Everything in order.

707
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:31,772
They've just arrived.

708
01:33:31,906 --> 01:33:35,034
I think there can be
no serious consequences.

709
01:33:35,577 --> 01:33:38,621
For better or for worse,
the boy has a family.

710
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:44,669
The interest of the case is relative.

711
01:33:44,769 --> 01:33:47,672
It's no longer
relevant, politically.

712
01:33:47,772 --> 01:33:49,290
What about the union?

713
01:33:50,049 --> 01:33:52,385
There is no union.

714
01:33:54,679 --> 01:33:58,308
Besides, I have too many children
to take care of.

715
01:33:58,779 --> 01:34:01,561
Have you made any statements
about the boy?

716
01:34:02,353 --> 01:34:03,696
It's for the best.

717
01:34:03,771 --> 01:34:06,024
Call the grandmother
and give the boy to her.

718
01:34:06,482 --> 01:34:08,735
The real issue
is the excess of children...

719
01:35:24,769 --> 01:35:26,007
You darned boy!

720
01:35:26,187 --> 01:35:27,939
You got me in trouble.

721
01:35:28,305 --> 01:35:31,275
My own troubles are enough!
Let's go home.

722
01:35:32,235 --> 01:35:34,862
I don't live there and I don't
want to hear from you!

723
01:35:35,482 --> 01:35:36,781
Look.

724
01:35:37,073 --> 01:35:39,667
They made me sign the paper.

725
01:35:39,742 --> 01:35:42,370
You have to come home for a few days.

726
01:35:42,662 --> 01:35:44,956
Until they forget about you.

727
01:35:45,403 --> 01:35:47,717
You better go see your mother.

728
01:35:47,792 --> 01:35:51,379
She got worse in the last
few days because of you.

729
01:36:48,461 --> 01:36:49,516
Mother.

730
01:38:27,662 --> 01:38:29,795
Hey. You are Tonio, aren't you?

731
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:31,998
I'm Manuel's fiancee.

732
01:38:36,742 --> 01:38:38,579
Manuel told me
you're headed down South.

733
01:38:38,838 --> 01:38:41,424
Now that you're free,
you're going. Right?

734
01:38:49,849 --> 01:38:52,101
No, I'm not going anymore.

735
01:38:52,268 --> 01:38:53,945
Where is Manuel?

736
01:38:54,020 --> 01:38:56,063
Looking for work.

737
01:38:56,522 --> 01:38:58,807
I'll meet him at the port shortly.

738
01:38:59,650 --> 01:39:02,319
We'll live together
when the child is born.

739
01:39:06,648 --> 01:39:08,774
I'll see you later.

740
01:39:08,874 --> 01:39:11,020
I come here quite often.

741
01:40:14,433 --> 01:40:16,393
Manuel, don't!

742
01:40:20,356 --> 01:40:22,533
Stop stealing, Manuel!

743
01:40:22,608 --> 01:40:23,367
Why?

744
01:40:23,442 --> 01:40:25,528
Stop stealing!

745
01:40:25,986 --> 01:40:28,251
You shouldn't steal anymore!
