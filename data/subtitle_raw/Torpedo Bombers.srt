The baby's awake.

18
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,920
Go to sleep!

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,920
- We could cover his eyes.
- No.

20
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,240
- Today is your birthday.
- My birthday, not yours.

21
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,840
- Shura...
- So we'll do as I say.

22
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,080
Right, baby?
You agree, don't you?

23
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
The Plotnikovs are already up.

24
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,240
Good morning. What's up?

25
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,240
The day I get shot down,
it'll be too late.

26
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,920
You're a big idiot.

27
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,520
Your foot.

28
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,240
Good morning from the officers'
club broadcasting room!

29
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,920
And now, for our first program...

30
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,520
An early bird.

31
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,760
- Good morning, sister!
- Good morning, Colonel.

32
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,440
- I'm only a first lieutenant.
- And we're nurses.

33
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,160
You may be a nurse,
but she's my kid sister.

34
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,520
One, two, three...

35
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,400
- You've only gotten up to three?
- Thirty-three!

36
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,520
Hold it, Diehard.

37
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,680
- Morning.
- Morning.

38
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,520
Shall we have a smoke, Sergei?

39
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,080
May I, Commander?

40
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,680
One, two, push!

41
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,920
You think you're strong enough
for that?

42
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,840
Cherepets, come here a second,
please.

43
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,920
Why are you picking on them?

44
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,520
They had the nerve to question
my honesty.

45
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,840
I went to the theatre last night
and they were in my seats.

46
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,680
So they said
I had the phony tickets.

47
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,840
They said to my girl:

48
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,000
"Your sergeant here has got
a phony pair of tickets..."

49
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,920
Are you positive the tickets were
authentic?

50
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,680
Major, sir,
you know me.

51
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,080
How can you even think
that I would fake tickets?

52
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,320
What's new in the naval air force?

53
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,320
Cherepets is up to his neck in
a big ticket fraud scandal.

54
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,840
It's not true! Yesterday, I was
given two theatre tickets.

55
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,920
I went there, and they were
sitting in my seats.

56
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,920
And they said,
"Your tickets are false".

57
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,760
Look at their smug mugs, but all
they know is "check your torpedo"...

58
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,520
- What's all this about?
- Cherepets forged the tickets.

59
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,320
- That's not true!
- Dismissed!

60
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,080
I can't give you an answer
until after the flight.

61
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
Yes, on orders.

62
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,080
Well, we'll discuss that
when I get back.

63
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,760
Dmitrienko, you just might
lose your teeth.

64
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,920
I can do it for four minutes now,
Colonel.

65
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,320
As soon as I add another minute,
I'm going to put on a show for you.

66
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,920
Forget it. Stop making
a circus out of my regiment.

67
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,080
You would hang there while
the music played, that's your show?

68
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,240
No, I won't allow such disgrace.

69
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,520
- What kind of jam is it?
- Apricot.

70
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Fall in, men!

71
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,520
Right dress!

72
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,920
Attention!

73
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,520
General, the special torpedo
and mine regiment is in formation.

74
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,840
How are you today?
Let's hear you.

75
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,680
Fine, thank you,
Commander!

76
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,080
Our scouts report the existence
of a fascist convoy in the area.

77
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,760
That means work for everybody.
We'll cover you up.

78
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,160
- Any changes in contact?
- Radio contact is the same.

79
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,920
Weather forecast?

80
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,400
Cloud density from six to eight.
Visibility ten meters maximum.

81
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,920
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.

82
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,320
To furnish us with technical

83
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,520
and tactical data on possible
torpedo launching, will go...

84
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,080
- Lieutenant Kurochkin.
- Here!

85
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,040
- And Captain Gavrilov.
- Yes, sir!

86
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,520
The choice of crew is yours.

87
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,080
- Permission to fall in?
- You're more than a minute late.

88
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,080
- By my watch...
- You might as well get rid of it.

89
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,760
- May I fall in now?
- You may.

90
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,600
Regiment, dismissed!

91
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,840
Major Plotnikov!

92
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,520
You'll take the lieutenant.

93
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,160
I'll take Gavrilov.

94
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,080
- You want to fly with me?
- All right.

95
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,320
The plane's ready for takeoff,
Commander.

96
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,520
Right.

97
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,080
Shall I get the second plane ready?

98
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,160
Alignment is okay.

99
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,560
Remove the right clamp.

100
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,160
My son's teacher
wrote me

101
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,960
that Igor almost drowned
himself in a barrel.

102
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,520
He'll make a good marine.

103
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,520
Navigator, we'll be the first
to take off.

104
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,320
It was a great gag, Lieutenant!

105
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,320
The way he threw his watch
away.

106
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,520
You two would make a good act.
Anyone else in this circus troupe?

107
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,920
You must admit I've got
the most original act.

108
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,520
Remind me to tell you which part
of your body you should hang from.

109
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,920
Stop pulling my leg!

110
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,920
Now, that's something!..

111
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,920
That's too much! Atta-boy!

112
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,760
Gavrilov, you're with Dmitrienko.

113
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,520
- Dmitrienko, hold it!
- Holding.

114
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,760
Gavrilov's going with you.

115
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,240
- Dmitrienko, I'm flying with you.
- Well, so be it.

116
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,320
Let's go, Diehard!
You, too, Gavrilov.

117
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,920
Ready for takeoff, Commander.

118
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,160
Good. Look after the lieutenant
colonel for us.

119
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,320
Follow me, Lieutenant Colonel.

120
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,760
We'll fix you up with a parachute.

121
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,520
You have to pull up,
Lieutenant Colonel.

122
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,520
- Have you removed the clamps?
- Yes.

123
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,000
Ready to saddle up, Yuri?

124
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,520
It's Shoura's birthday today.

125
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,760
We thought maybe you
and your spouse, Nastya,

126
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,560
would like to come
to our little party.

127
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,680
Your invitation is accepted.

128
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,920
- Need some help?
- Yeah.

129
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,320
- Everything alright in there?
- Fine.

130
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
Not too tough
for the lieutenant colonel?

131
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,000
Everything's just fine, Major.

132
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,320
In that case, let's take off.

133
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,160
Pull here only in an emergency.

134
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,520
Now, this "mama" gets
hooked up to this "papa".

135
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,320
Now I'm switching you on.

136
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,840
You'll be able to hear
and to speak.

137
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,920
- It's not bad in here...
- We've got a great view.

138
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,520
And if all goes as scheduled,

139
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,320
you'll see how the boat explodes.
It's even a better view from there.

140
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,760
Anything to report, navigator?

141
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,680
- Any problems, navigator?
- Nothing to report.

142
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,920
I want the weather and the time.

143
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,920
Bespashko might've been right.
My watch is on the blink.

144
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,520
This is Poppy-6.
Requesting permission to take off.

145
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,680
Permission granted.

146
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,320
Flowerbed, this is Poppy-6.
Requesting permission to take off.

147
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,640
Poppy-6, this is Flowerbed.
Permission granted.

148
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,920
Roger.

149
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,920
Shoura, come in the house.
They'll do without our boys today.

150
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,520
They didn't!

151
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:34,320
- What did you say?
- I say they didn't do without them.

152
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,880
- Which plane is theirs?
- How do I know?

153
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,080
I don't know anything...

154
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,080
You got scared, didn't you,
esteemed doggy?

155
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,520
Are you begging for mercy?

156
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,160
- You promise not to bite?
- Yes.

157
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,840
Out you go!

158
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,520
Take that!
How could you be late today?

159
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,240
- You know what day it is?
- November 17.

160
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,920
- Yes, well?
- We met a year ago today.

161
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,320
Watch out! Gases!

162
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,160
Thanks. See you!

163
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,920
All clear!

164
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,840
- Why, it's Sasha Belobrov!
- Hi, Kilia!

165
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,320
Shoura, Belobrov is here!

166
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,160
Well, how are you doing here?

167
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,320
All right.
Drop by our barber's shop sometime.

168
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,400
Shoura, look who's here!

169
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,240
Can I warm up?
- Sasha!

170
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,080
- Why do you feel so hot?
- That's a hot-water bottle.

171
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,920
- Is everybody all right?
- Yes. We speak about you often.

172
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,520
- And now I'm here.
- I don't believe it.

173
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,920
- How is Nastya?
- That's where you've been wounded?

174
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,520
He's got his arms and legs,
that's what counts.

175
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,680
Nastya's gotten married.

176
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,520
- Kilia, go get some firewood!
- It's already done.

177
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,160
- Get some water, then!
- That's done, too.

178
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,320
I believe in telling the truth.

179
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,840
Yes, Sasha, she is right.

180
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,720
What happened to your face?

181
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,080
The doctors say it will heal.

182
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,520
Plotnikov, right?

183
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,920
- Of course...
- Sasha, wait!

184
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,520
She was going to write to you.
I was the one who told her not to.

185
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,520
I thought it would be better
this way.

186
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,520
Today is my birthday.
Come back tonight.

187
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,240
Everyone will be happy to see
you. Please, say you'll come.

188
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,080
After all, it's my birthday!

189
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,160
Kilia, how could you do
such a thing?

190
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,080
General, I've intercepted
a message.

191
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,840
The Germans have issued
a warning along the entire coast.

192
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,000
Flowerbed, this is Clover.
Mission completed.

193
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,520
Clover, this is Flowerbed.
Message received.

194
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,840
Flowerbed, this is Marigold.
The Poppies are coming closer.

195
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,520
Roger. Thanks.

196
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,920
Good work, Fomenko, right
on time.

197
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,760
- Flowerbed, this is Poppy-1 .
- Poppy-1 , this is Flowerbed.

198
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,360
This is Poppy-1 . The orchestra
is playing as scheduled.

199
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,520
We'll do our work now.
Do you read me? Over.

200
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,640
Poppy-1 , this is Flowerbed.
You may proceed.

201
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,840
Let's go!

202
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,840
Poppies, this is Poppy-1 .
It's dispersal time.

203
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,760
Navigator, the second boat
on the right is our target.

204
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,160
I got it.

205
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,400
A little more to the right, Sergei.
That's fine.

206
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,840
- Fire!
- Yes, fire!

207
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,520
Commander, our left fuel tank
has been hit!

208
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,920
Commander, we're losing fuel!

209
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,080
- The engine's on fire!
- I said, fire!

210
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:29,880
- The left tank is hit!
- Shut up!

211
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,400
I said, attack!

212
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,320
Commander, the torpedo's hit
water.

213
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,920
The torpedo has been launched!
Report it!

214
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,160
The torpedo has been launched!

215
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,680
- The torpedo...
- Shut up!

216
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,400
Flowerbed, this is Poppy-6.

217
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,080
Come on, calm down.
Everything will be all right...

218
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,840
Flowerbed, this is Poppy-6!
This is Poppy-6...

219
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,160
More to the right.

220
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,240
Go ahead, Commander.
A little bit more...

221
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,320
Even more. Right, Commander.

222
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,680
Good... A little more to the right.

223
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,520
To the right.

224
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,520
We're on fire, navigator.

225
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,160
Forget about the torpedoes now!

226
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,000
Forget about the torpedoes...

227
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,760
I'm sorry, buddy! I'm sorry...

228
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:01,400
Sasha, you are back!
Did you hear? It's so awful!

229
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,840
Listen to a young girl
from Moscow, Olga Ivanchenko.

230
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,240
You wrote
that you were wounded in combat...

231
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,160
Excuse me, Lieutenant, but I'm
afraid you're at the wrong table.

232
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,320
No, guys,
he's at the right table.

233
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,080
- When did you get back?
- This morning.

234
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,160
- Then you've heard?
- Yes...

235
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,320
- Sasha Belobrov, welcome back!
- Oh, Belobrov, long time no see!

236
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,160
We were told you've been
transferred to another regiment.

237
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,320
No, I was on leave.

238
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,840
- Sasha!
- Diehard!

239
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,520
How are you? You, old son of
a gun...

240
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,680
- You saw how it was with Fomenko?
- Yes.

241
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,400
- And Plotnikov?
- I saw it, Sasha.

242
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,320
I have a terrible headache...

243
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,760
I'm like a broken-down engine,
a broken-down engine.

244
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:02,520
- Have you brought cigarettes?
- No... sorry.

245
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,400
It stinks.

246
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,160
I'm a broken-down engine,
with no cigarettes, imagine!

247
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,520
That's versification.

248
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,760
- You need a rest.
- Will you two be flying together?

249
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,760
Just before takeoff, Fomenko
sent Gavrilov with Dmitrienko.

250
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,920
Maroussia, Cherepets is sending
his love.

251
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,680
Thanks.

252
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,320
Life is strange, isn't it?

253
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,320
What d'you mean?

254
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,520
Women never listen.

255
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,160
I have been telling Nastya,
warning her:

256
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,160
"Don't drop Belobrov. He'll be
back."

257
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,760
Now, look what happened.
Plotnikov is dead.

258
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,000
- You've got the green light.
- I don't get it.

259
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,520
Of course, you do.
Every cloud has a silver lining.

260
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,520
Now I've got it.

261
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,920
Sasha? Belobrov!

262
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,000
Sasha! Belobrov!

263
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,520
Sasha, wait!

264
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,520
- I didn't recognize you.
- It's so good to see you!

265
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,640
- When did you get back?
- This morning.

266
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,320
I guess you know what's happened.

267
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,680
After so many years of soldiering,
each time it's a shock.

268
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,680
- Are you going to the garrison?
- Yes, sir.

269
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,320
- Get in.
- Thank you.

270
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,920
Would you believe it? They
found my Igor in an orphanage.

271
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,520
- Have you heard from Lyalya?
- Nothing from Lyalya yet.

272
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,000
At flight school,
Fomenko was the best.

273
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,000
- Moukhine, step on it!
- Our brakes are not very good...

274
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,400
How are you feeling, are you
ready to go back to work?

275
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,920
I'm ready and can work very well,
General.

276
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,160
- Did you know Plotnikov?
- He was a friend.

277
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,240
Yeah, these things happen...
Someone should go see the families.

278
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,000
It's funny. Take this place.

279
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,400
We've got everything we need:
a barber's shop, even a theatre...

280
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,520
Life could be so simple, so
pleasant. War is an ugly thing.

281
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,920
Shoura, we'd better get
two chairs from Nastya.

282
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,160
Sasha, I'll have a smoke here.

283
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,080
It's open!

284
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,520
I'm so happy you've come,
Sasha. Take your coat off.

285
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,600
Nastya! Mother!

286
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,240
You don't forget your friends,
do you?

287
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,520
- Belobrovik is here!
- How are you?

288
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,320
It's been three months, Sasha.
Were you wounded?

289
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,520
Wounded and contused.
I was telling you about it, mom.

290
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,520
Nastya, we've got company.

291
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,080
Take off your jacket. Nastya'll
be right here. Why the sour face?

292
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,920
- Did they feed you well there?
- Mother, is that really important?

293
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,920
I survived...

294
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,240
Sasha, look at me.

295
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,720
Sasha, look at me!

296
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,680
- They...
- They... never returned?

297
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,520
They are being late.

298
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,760
- Shoura...
- Never returned...

299
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,320
What is it? What's wrong?
What happened, I don't understand?

300
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,920
What never returned?
Was it their plane?

301
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,840
Yes, Maria...

302
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,080
Sasha, what a nice surprise!

303
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,160
- But they are alive.
- They never returned...

304
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:32,080
- Their plane didn't return.
- They never returned?

305
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,520
The plane didn't return.

306
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,760
Say something!

307
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:47,520
Shoura, calm down...
Wait, Shoura.

308
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,520
This is Lieutenant Belobrov.

309
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,560
I said this is
Lieutenant Belobrov speaking.

310
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,680
They are not coming back, mommy!

311
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,400
Oh, mommy!..

312
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,240
- Nastya.
- They didn't return.

313
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,600
You already told them, didn't you?

314
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,320
Dear Mother,

315
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,000
I want to inform you that your son,
Fyodor Cherepets, have got a medal.

316
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,160
Now, I've got even more
important news.

317
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,080
Her name is Maroussia,
she works in the canteen.

318
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,080
We've decided we'd like
to have three children.

319
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,400
- I burned the meat at lunch.
- Yes, it's such a beautiful day!

320
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,000
Let's go for a walk. Who knows
it may be freezing tomorrow.

321
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,240
My girl can reach her ear
with her feet.

322
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,520
I'd be surprised if your Maroussia
could use her body like that.

323
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,680
All right, let's go
grub some fish.

324
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,080
Fyodor, women like men
who are rough and aggressive.

325
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,520
And you, like Diehard,
only run after them and sniff.

326
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,240
- Come on, stop it.
- Fyodor!

327
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,000
Come on, sailors, move it!
It's almost low tide.

328
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,120
We're coming!

329
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:23,240
It's absolutely clear that
Maroussia's unloading the margarine.

330
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,600
I'll go help her.

331
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,560
Maroussia!

332
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,160
- Hey, watch where you're going!
- Stop screaming!

333
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,680
We've got equipment to unload
stuff. What's the winch for?

334
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:57,240
What winch? This is sabotage!
What's your name?

335
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:03,320
I'll buy her a warm coat,
with a fur collar.

336
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,320
What's happened here?

337
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:10,760
What is it you're mumbling?
May I ask what is so funny?

338
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,760
What's your name, Sergeant?

339
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,160
Please, Lieutenant,
he didn't do it on purpose.

340
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,000
Igor is coming very soon.
What a life, huh?

341
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,400
Just a second. Are you flying
because of my report?

342
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,600
- Yes. You're Semetchkin?
- Semouzhkin.

343
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,760
I fired at that Messerschmitt
from as close as thirty meters.

344
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,840
I've never seen anything like it,
the shells just came off.

345
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,160
- You expect us to believe that?
- I swear!

346
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,840
I used the hyperbola.
I gave it to him from 30 meters.

347
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,920
- And you couldn't bring him down?
- I couldn't. He was untouchable.

348
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:58,520
You're not just a poor shot.
You're a poor shot with imagination.

349
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,080
I'm glad there aren't many
like you.

350
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,520
What d'you know, he used
the hyperbola.

351
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,520
And now the respected people
have to investigate on his report.

352
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,520
- To fly they don't know where.
- To look they don't know for.

353
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,080
- We know what for.
- To report on what never happened.

354
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,920
Don't worry, Semouzhkin,
we'll keep your secret.

355
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,960
The plane is ready for takeoff,
Lieutenant.

356
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,320
- Well, flying together again?
- Sure thing.

357
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,840
Wait, little sister!

358
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,240
- How are you, sister?
- I'm fine, Colonel.

359
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,520
- I'm a lieutenant, not a colonel.
- And I'm a nurse, not a sister.

360
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,880
Look, it's the political officer.

361
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,000
- Ready for takeoff?
- Yes, we are.

362
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:05,320
If you find that plane,
try to land.

363
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,840
Semouzhkin claims
he could not have missed it.

364
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,320
He talked our ears off about it.

365
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,920
The Germans are experimenting with
new night sights on these planes.

366
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,160
- That's why we're going.
- All right.

367
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,080
I read your report, Belobrov.

368
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,920
It's a pretty nasty story.
An ugly story.

369
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,080
What would you have done,
if you had been in my place?

370
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,240
I understand you as a man,
but I can't approve.

371
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,560
- May I leave now?
Good luck!

372
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,080
It's departure time.

373
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,520
It's bad luck to whistle
in an airplane.

374
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,520
- How about singing?
- If it's a love song, it's okay.

375
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:16,160
I heard they found a huge whale
on the shore in Guildin.

376
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,320
How come they jump up
on the shore?

377
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,600
It had too much margarine to eat,
and it felt real awful.

378
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,520
So awful that the whale made up
his mind to end it all.

379
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,320
And as soon as he washed up
onto the shore, he was all in tears.

380
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,920
All he wanted was to see some
Maroussia once more.

381
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,080
Come on, Lieutenant,
is this your idea offun?

382
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,240
No, it's not... but imagine
the poor whale.

383
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,520
Look, the Messerschmitt is
down there.

384
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,320
Yes, that's him, Commander!

385
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:07,840
I'm going to make a circle
and try landing.

386
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,600
This is the one
from Semouzhkin's report.

387
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,600
You can see the bullet holes:
they're all over.

388
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,760
I wonder how it was able
to stay in the air.

389
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,840
Just as we were told,
the night sight is here.

390
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,000
- Does this ace bother you?
- No, let him sit.

391
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,240
Catch!

392
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,400
- How old do you think he is?
- Our age, I guess.

393
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,080
Take cover! The fascists!

394
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,520
Run, Sasha!

395
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,840
- Did you do it?
- I pulled it off!

396
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,920
I shouted to you: "Fascists!"
And you ran like rabbits!

397
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,160
Everything's all right now.

398
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,320
Commander, why are you
flying that way?

399
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,920
I'm flying the right way.

400
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,520
- Are you looking for Plotnikov?
- Right.

401
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,520
Look where the part of the fuselage
was thrown off, and the wing, too.

402
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,320
It must have been quite an impact.

403
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,160
I wish we could land.

404
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,680
Well, heading home?

405
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:51,840
In the sky the sun is bright,
River ducks are quacking.

406
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:58,520
My sweetheart holds me tight,
All he knows is necking.

407
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,760
- Artyukhov!
- Artyukhov's listening.

408
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,920
Where can I get a fly now?

409
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,840
Seek and ye shall find.
Spring's almost here.

410
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,080
And what shall I do then?

411
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:19,000
You dry up a green fly, make it
into powder and put it in her food.

412
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,920
- Whose food?
- Your love interest's

413
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,760
- Why?
- It excites them.

414
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,920
- Who?
- Who do you think, huh?

415
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,840
- Then what do I do?
- Then comes the best part.

416
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,320
I put on some soft music and leave.

417
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,520
Like I have to go to the post office.
And you two are left alone.

418
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:54,160
No, she wouldn't do it.
She is not like that.

419
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
You must work on it.

420
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,520
Once you've gotten the first
kiss, you're in.

421
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,320
Then the chemistry gets working.

422
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:10,160
You should kiss her for as long
as you can hold your breath.

423
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,080
No, she is not like that.

424
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:54,240
If you look at air force statistics,
you'll see that there are those

425
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:59,520
who fly and those who just
hang around the airfields.

426
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,240
Still we're all called pilots.
That's what kills me.

427
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,080
You look like a watermelon
with this haircut of yours.

428
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,680
Our guys talked to people

429
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,760
from the British Royal Air Force.
You know how they handle it?

430
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:37,920
With them, if you're a master
sergeant flying as a gunner,

431
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,720
and the other one is a major
who never flies,

432
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,520
then you can have a bathtub,
and he, the major...

433
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,920
The English don't have master
sergeants, only regular sergeants.

434
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:54,320
And they're all redheads.
Like they all had the same father.

435
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,160
A very apt observation.

436
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,520
And they're liars like all pilots.

437
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,080
To hear them, they're all heroes,
but actually they're ordinary guys.

438
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,400
Well, if you want it straight,

439
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:10,240
you've got enough suckers
in your kitchen, too.

440
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,320
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing...

441
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,160
- What is he doing?
- His evening workout.

442
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,000
- What is that there?
- Where?

443
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,240
Just a joke.

444
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:47,080
I have to go.
Shall we say goodbye?

445
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,320
I guess you must report back, too.

446
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,920
Well, good night.

447
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,400
Maroussia, let's stop pretending.

448
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,680
What do we need that for?

449
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:12,920
Stop it!
What's wrong with you, lousy hero?

450
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,840
I've had enough of it.

451
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,520
You all behave like animals.

452
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,320
You're on your leave,
but what do I have to do with it?

453
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:29,840
- As if that's all that counts...
- Maroussia, I'm sorry.

454
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,000
Look who's here!
Small world!

455
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,520
Nice to see you,
Lieutenant.

456
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,320
- You can't smoke here.
- Sorry.

457
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,320
I was supposed to fly
with Fomenko on that day.

458
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,520
- Good evening.
- How are you doing?

459
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,080
Yes, I know.

460
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,320
He changed everything around
at the very last minute.

461
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,520
I'm going home. You coming?

462
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,320
Lieutenant, Captain,
I'm Semouzhkin, remember?

463
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,760
- How is the ace tonight?
- Come to our table, will you?

464
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,920
We've got to get up early tomorrow.
We're picking up his son.

465
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,760
Who knows when we'll see each
other again, and it's a special day.

466
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,920
- I'm Olga.
- Captain Gavrilov.

467
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,520
I'm inviting you, too.
Come on in.

468
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,680
We'll be waiting for you.

469
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,840
- Well, Belobrov?
- Come on, guys...

470
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:56,520
They're heroes.
They've saved my pilot's honor.

471
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,240
You needn't mix it.

472
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:06,920
As long as there are men like them
in our Air Force, we needn't worry.

473
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,760
To heroism!

474
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,160
Guys, I swear you're singing it
all wrong. Start again.

475
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:46,160
Captain,
Sergeant Cherepets has a problem.

476
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,600
- What problem?
- You'd better come.

477
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,320
Where's Belobrov?

478
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,160
I haven't been able to locate
Lieutenant Belobrov.

479
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,920
- Cherepets, who did this to you?
- The same father...

480
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,400
- Who hit him?
- Let me tell you.

481
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:19,840
I noticed that he and Artyukhov have
been hoarding the flight rations.

482
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,840
Don't give me that crap.
I want to know who hit him?

483
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:27,600
When you try the margarine,
you'll know who's giving you crap.

484
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,520
They all have the same dad
and a bathtub...

485
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:35,680
The English are all
red-headed bobbies...

486
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:46,920
They attacked Pearl Harbor...
Pearl Harbor is here!

487
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,160
A sailor never surrenders!

488
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:58,080
Battle stations! Battle stations!
On the double!

489
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,920
Give the enemy all you've got!

490
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,360
Get them...

491
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:11,920
Your garage there is a dragnet,
It attracts me like a magnet.

492
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:17,760
All the fences I trespass
Just to see my blue-eyed lass.

493
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,520
I'm crazy about my fox,
Here's a gift to her of a box.

494
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:29,400
There's a fur coat in this trough,
And the poems by Lermontov.

495
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,840
Wait a second! You forgot
something!

496
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,920
This is for you,
and this is for your son.

497
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:47,320
Doctor, how do you expect us to
feed it? Diehard will gobble it.

498
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,320
I'll take the rabbit. Diehard,
he'll be your little brother.

499
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:56,080
Vitamin C.
Open your mouths!

500
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:58,520
You smell like medicine,
go away!

501
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:03,160
- Can you hang long by your teeth?
- Three minutes, but I'll make it 5.

502
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,240
I guess your brain
might be affected.

503
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,520
Vitamin C,
not a wrinkle on your face to see.

504
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,520
Obviously a pilot's dog,
not a sailor's.

505
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:25,080
It's dogged that does it.

506
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,160
Take care, kid.

507
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:44,520
A spoonful for those leaving,
a spoonful for those staying.

508
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,920
Can I get you anything
from town?

509
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,520
Look, he's gone! You can't
bring him back.

510
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,000
We can't wait to meet your kid!

511
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:15,320
Gavrilov, make sure the rabbit
doesn't catch cold!

512
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,760
- Well, we're off!
- Yeah.

513
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,000
If I hadn't been leaving,
I wouldn't be telling you that.

514
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,520
You know how Belobrov
feels about you.

515
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,240
Yes, he is my friend.

516
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,080
He is MY friend, and with you,
he is in love.

517
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,680
What do you want from me?

518
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,760
Mother, come here.

519
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,680
- Your heard our conversation?
- Yes, I did.

520
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,920
Don't you think I'm right? What
would you do in Nastya's place?

521
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:27,320
I'd do what my heart said.

522
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,240
Forget that I even asked you!

523
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:36,160
Sasha, why don't you carry
a rabbit a while?

524
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,320
I don't want to break up
a friendship that's just started.

525
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:42,920
Besides, you look adorable
with the rabbit and the dog.

526
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,160
You can hold them both
in the same hand.

527
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,080
Sasha, hold the rabbit,
you scoundrel.

528
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,240
- Come on, give it here.
- No, I want him to do it.

529
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,040
We'll have to check the rabbit in.

530
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,160
Please, take the rabbit. I feel hot.

531
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,320
You feel hot with the rabbit,
without him you'll feel cold.

532
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,840
- How much?
- Five hundred.

533
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,840
- Is it worth it?
- Natural polecat.

534
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:16,320
- You don't need a suit, do you?
- No, of course not.

535
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:22,000
- Here you are.
- Thanks. You've already paid.

536
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:27,080
- Excuse me.
- Thanks very much.

537
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,840
This potato's frozen solid.

538
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,160
Are you crazy?
Is your rabbit for sale?

539
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,160
- I'm selling him cheap, too.
- It might cost you dear.

540
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,760
- What d'you mean? Take it!
- I wouldn't.

541
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,160
The train's already here!

542
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,240
Hurry up!

543
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:02,920
- Have you seen a little boy?
- The boy is right here!

544
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,080
Are you Igor Gavrilov?

545
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,920
Yes, I'm Igor Gavrilov.
Which one's my dad?

546
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:19,320
- Which one of you is his father?
- He is his father!

547
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,840
I'm your dad, Igor...

548
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:30,520
- Come, Igor.
- I want to have a pee.

549
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,640
Alert! Combat positions!

550
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:03,400
Hello! Shoura, it's me.

551
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,160
Kilia, the shaving bowl.

552
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,760
- Have you packed?
- My mother's doing it.

553
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:17,680
I brought you some potatoes.

554
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:25,400
They're not frozen. You can cook
them and eat during the journey.

555
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,760
- Do you want a haircut?
- That's a good idea.

556
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,520
Take off your coat.

557
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,920
I didn't see you. How are you?

558
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,520
That might be the last time
that I give you a haircut.

559
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,920
No, never mind then.
I don't want it.

560
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:47,520
I'm fed up with it. He dropped it,
bastard!

561
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:55,240
- Do Fascists see us from up there?
- They sure do.

562
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:02,160
- Can they hit us?
- No, they can't.

563
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,320
- Why not?
- No one can hit us.

564
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,320
Igor, don't you remember
Lyalya at all?

565
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,840
Try to remember, boy.
Do you remember Zhenya?

566
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:27,520
- No.
- A girl named Zhenya?

567
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:34,920
Do you remember riding
a bicycle with your mother?

568
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:41,680
We used to ride together.
You don't remember...

569
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,520
Alright now, up you go!

570
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,000
Do you think a porcupine
will win over a rabbit?

571
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,240
- What?
- Who is stronger of them two?

572
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,760
I don't know.

573
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,760
- Can I have more meat?
- You've already eaten.

574
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,840
- I really love it.
- You've eaten too much.

575
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:24,320
Now you're going to lie down,
and put your head on your pillow.

576
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,000
- Where are you going, daddy?
- I'll be right back.

577
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,160
This boy is not mine.

578
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:46,520
He doesn't remember a thing:
neither Lyalya, nor Zhenya.

579
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:55,960
He's a big boy, 5 years old,
he should remember.

580
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:02,400
And he doesn't look like me
or like Lyalya.

581
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,520
He steals food.

582
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:15,520
If you're so sure, then...

583
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,680
Then what?

584
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,320
If this isn't him, then where is
my son?

585
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,520
And what do you expect me to say?
"Sorry, I'm not your father"?

586
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:44,920
You know, I like the boy.

587
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,680
He told me today:
"I had a porcupine with big ears."

588
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,920
I mean they are so...

589
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:03,920
We've got to do something
about Cherepets.

590
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:09,320
His Maroussia's leaving.
She's got TB.

591
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:15,240
The doctor told me. They're
sending her off tomorrow.

592
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:19,920
And Cherepets still has three
days of punishment left.

593
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:24,320
Sasha, you've got a good eye.
Look at me from this angle.

594
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,320
Don't you think that when Igor
smiles his upper lip looks like mine?

595
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,080
Idiot! Grab the washbowl!
Don't you see he's throwing up?

596
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,720
Easy, easy now. That damn meat.

597
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,520
Upper lip...
You're incredible.

598
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:52,400
- Shall I call the doctor?
- No, the doctor scares me.

599
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:01,520
I don't know why I agreed.
I must be losing my mind.

600
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:06,920
Don't worry, Moukhine.
It'll just take a couple of minutes.

601
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:11,000
Here, how about some chocolate?

602
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:17,320
Look, I'll take one more from you.
The lieutenant loves medals.

603
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,320
Let me have your scarf.
Yours looks fresher.

604
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,080
Leave me something to wear.

605
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:30,520
Moukhine, there'd be no Air Force
without you.

606
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:35,520
Go easy on the chocolate,
it's a stimulant.

607
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,520
My tunic has holes all over,
but at least I look good.

608
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,920
Just don't overact.

609
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:50,080
Are you going to give us
a picture of yourself, Moukhine?

610
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:54,680
- Moukhine, answer me!
- Let's leave poor Moukhine alone.

611
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,240
Let's get serious now.

612
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:02,160
Shall I stop here?

613
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,320
Go all the way to the entrance
and honk your horn.

614
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,760
No horn.

615
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,160
- All right, I'll go now.
- Hold it.

616
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,320
- Go on, honk, Moukhine.
- Come on, Moukhine, honk.

617
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:23,160
All right, go ahead now.

618
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:27,600
- Don't screw it up, medal holder.
- Shut up, Belobrov.

619
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,600
- Hello. Are you in charge here?
- Yes, sir.

620
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:39,520
Follow me!

621
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:46,920
- I'd better leave.
- Turn the engine off.

622
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:59,160
Maroussia, TB... There's nothing
wrong with her. She's strong.

623
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,680
It doesn't mean anything.
You're strong too and still...

624
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,520
- Nothing wrong with me!
- Except your nerves.

625
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,240
I'm going to have problems
because of this Cherepets thing.

626
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,520
Wait in the car.

627
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,760
Now, he'll make up a wild story.

628
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,400
Look at you! Get that jacket
buttoned!

629
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,920
If he goes like that,
he'll never make it to the harbor.

630
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,520
Step lively, lover boy!

631
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,920
Step on it, Moukhine!
How was my act?

632
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,080
Shoura, the papers are all inside.

633
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,000
Be careful, the dishes are in there.

634
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:21,520
- Mother, please, just go.
- Alright.

635
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,080
Here, take this.

636
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:32,840
Mother, for the last time,
just go over there.

637
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:36,080
- Shoura, calm down.
- Leave me alone.

638
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,600
Mother, there's no reason
to open that now.

639
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:45,600
It's not raining.
Please, get on the boat.

640
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,920
- Where's Maroussia?
- She's already aboard.

641
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,520
She didn't take the fabric.

642
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:07,920
- Don't let her see your eye.
- Yeah, sure...

643
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:15,320
Don't get upset about Shoura.
She's just very nervous.

644
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,840
Have a good trip.

645
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:27,680
Why are you so mad at me,
Maroussia?

646
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,840
I thought you were mad.

647
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:47,320
Loading is almost completed!

648
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:56,160
All right, I'll take it if you want.

649
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,520
There's enough for a long coat.

650
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:02,840
Don't make anything stylish,
you need something warm.

651
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,760
Thank you.

652
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:20,920
- I'm late. Let me help you.
- No one can help me now.

653
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,760
- Shoura, cut it out!
- Let go, do you hear?

654
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,520
- Shoura, please...
- Mother, get on the boat!

655
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,320
Stop being hysterical, Shoura.

656
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:40,000
- Sasha, stay alive!
- Goodbye, Maria!

657
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:46,240
Mommy, I beg you,
get on the boat.

658
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:53,320
It's all over, Sasha.

659
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,520
- Shoura, please...
- As if it were a dream...

660
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:04,760
We'll beat them. They'll pay
for what they've done.

661
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:08,760
I swear to you.

662
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,920
Shoura, write to me when you
get there.

663
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,400
I will.
Don't be fools, guys!

664
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:40,320
Here we are!
What a beautiful weather!

665
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,520
Shall we jump down?

666
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:51,920
Give me a hand!

667
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,680
Ladies and gentlemen,
thanks very much for your show.

668
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:10,760
Sorry, but you're not allowed
to take pictures.

669
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,680
You'll always be welcome here.
Come again after our victory.

670
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,320
Thank you. Goodbye.

671
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,920
Be careful on the ladder.
Have a good trip!

672
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,080
Officer on duty, report to
the commander!

673
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:43,320
When the coat is made,
will you take a photo of it

674
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,160
and send me the picture?

675
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,920
You ought not to kiss me.

676
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:07,920
But the doctor said I should
recover and be able to have kids.

677
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:15,760
I'm a strong girl. I'm going
to be just fine.

678
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:25,320
It's beautiful here in the North,
but it's not bad in the South either.

679
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,320
So you've made it.

680
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,520
Aren't you cold?
Get in the car.

681
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,520
For once, you could have
been on time.

682
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:08,320
I bought a fur collar for Maroussia,
and I forgot it.

683
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,520
From a real polecat.

684
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,840
It used to be Diehard's
mother-in-law.

685
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:50,160
Nastya, Sasha, take care!

686
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,920
- What's your name?
- Igor Gavrilov.

687
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:01,080
- Igor Gavrilov.
- I'm Major Kislov.

688
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:03,520
- I'm Major Ivanov.
- Igor Gavrilov.

689
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,760
- What do you say?
- Thanks very much.

690
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,920
- Is he your son?
- Yes.

691
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:12,160
- What's your name?
- Igor Gavrilov.

692
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:17,520
- Major Boiko.
- Lieutenant Motyl.

693
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:39,320
You? Is anything wrong?

694
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,240
Say something...

695
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,160
This second?

696
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,600
This second.

697
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,320
- What shall I tell you?
- Whatever you want.

698
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,080
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

699
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,440
Forgive me.

700
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,760
Our intelligence service

701
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,920
has discovered an enemy
submarine in Zone Five.

702
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,320
It appears to have had engine
trouble,

703
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,760
and is being towed away
by combat vessels.

704
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:47,080
Belobrov and his men

705
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:50,160
will conduct a reconnaissance
mission and report back to us.

706
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:57,680
The rest are to maintain
combat readiness.

707
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,400
- That's all I have to say.
- One moment.

708
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:03,080
- Captain Bespashko!
- Yes, sir.

709
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,920
- Front and center.
- Yes, sir.

710
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,920
You were right the other day.
Your watch was correct.

711
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:18,320
- Take it. Back in formation.
- Yes, sir.

712
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:23,680
Next, throw away your insignia
and you'll become a general!

713
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,520
Diehard, my boy...

714
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,000
You miss your brother rabbit?

715
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:50,000
- Rev her up!
- Right away!

716
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:17,680
Thanks, Seraphima.

717
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,520
- We're all set!
- Let's go.

718
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,520
- Ready to go, navigator?
- Ready.

719
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,680
- How is the gunner?
- Ready.

720
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:46,680
Then it's departure time.
Last call.

721
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,080
Flowerbed, this is Poppy-4.

722
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:59,160
Request permission to begin
reconnaissance. May we take off?

723
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,160
Permission granted.

724
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:56,680
Big gray stone, big gray stone
of some thirty pound...

725
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:02,520
How d'you think a fly lands on a
ceiling, from a loop or from a spin?

726
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:13,080
Big gray stone's not as heavy
As the pain of the love-bound.

727
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,840
We used to have flowers outside
our window.

728
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:25,080
You look out and you see
flowers everywhere, everywhere...

729
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:41,760
Aren't those drifting mines down
there? Look down, navigator.

730
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:59,320
They're not mines, Skipper!
They're barrels!

731
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,160
Barrels from our transport ship!

732
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:46,080
Gunner... Cherepets!

733
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:52,320
Maroussia...

734
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:15,520
Don't you dare to switch off
like that again, you hear?

735
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:30,240
Poppy-5, Poppy-9, have you
seen it?

736
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:41,000
- Flowerbed, this is Poppy-4.
- Poppy-4, this is Flowerbed.

737
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:44,400
Flowerbed, this is Poppy-4.
They're all in place.

738
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:49,080
- Ready to begin operation.
- Roger. Proceed at once.

739
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:54,080
Poppies, this is Poppy-4.
Dispersal now.

740
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:15,600
They will pay for that, bastards!
We'll send them all to the bottom!

741
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,080
Attack! Attack! Attack!!!

742
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:02,920
Nine hundred, eight hundred,
six hundred...

743
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,400
Pay for it! Pay for it!

744
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:34,240
Over to your left, Sasha.
Just a little more.

745
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:39,080
Do exactly as I tell you,
I'll guide you.

746
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:44,000
Everything's all right, Sasha.
Left foot forward.

747
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:47,840
We're going home, Sasha.

748
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:55,520
Skipper! Skipper!

749
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:00,320
Zvyaguintsev!

750
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,000
Sasha! Sasha!

751
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:59,680
The film group thanks
the pilots and the sailors

752
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:05,400
of the Red Banner Northern Fleet
for participating in the shooting.

753
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:21,240
The End
