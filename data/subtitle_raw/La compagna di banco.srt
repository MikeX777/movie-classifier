1
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,166
- It's seven, you must go to school.
- Did the alarm go off?

2
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,583
Mr. Mario.

3
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:06,166
- Mario, it's late.
- What?

4
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,666
It's late.

5
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,375
- What is this?
- Coffee.

6
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,958
It's 7:30, you need to go to school.

7
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:11,208
- Hi, Dad.
- What about Sunday?

8
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:15,791
- I may go to the stadium.
- I mean Sunday, our waitress!

9
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,833
She is acting stupid, your mother
is a lawyer, you are being a jerk.

10
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:23,125
- I don't like it!
- It's late, I am going to school.

11
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,791
Go, it's better. I will break your knee.

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,875
- Can I have a quarter of a liter?
- What a luxury! Want a sandwich too?

13
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,000
Good morning, guys.

14
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:15,416
Everybody go in. Don't make a mess.

15
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,250
- What are you doing? It's starting!
- Yes!

16
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,333
- Hi, Salvatore.
- Hi.

17
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:27,291
- You are always fat, huh?
- And you are always a piece of shit.

18
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,041
- Are you in 3rd B?
- Yes, hi. Your name?

19
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:47,375
It's Ripandelli? She is prettier!

20
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,166
No. This must be a new one.

21
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,375
It's better, I like to change.

22
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:55,208
- Get in the classroom!
- Shut up!

23
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,416
We will show you around Trani.

24
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,750
Is this a dream?

25
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:04,500
Get a sandwich!

26
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,250
Here. Nightshades are a type of plant.

27
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,916
Let's see if you studied.

28
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,375
Can someone tell me
what are the dicotyledons?

29
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,000
- They have a pair of cotyledon.
- What did you say?

30
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,833
- They have a pair of cotyledon.
- No, my dear.

31
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:27,083
If you say it like that,
it sounds like a bad word.

32
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,291
They are a type of angiosperms

33
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,583
that have two cotyledon,

34
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:36,291
with a taproot and veiny leaves.

35
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,583
You must say it like that,
it has to be clear.

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,375
Silence! Come on!

37
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:48,458
- What are you doing there?
- There is a new classmate.

38
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,041
We were introducing each other.

39
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,583
Do you want
to tell her all about you in one hour?

40
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:57,583
Go to the last desk
so you can focus better.

41
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,083
Let her go.

42
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,625
The professor threw her at him.

43
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,791
Let's hope that he doesn't like her,
so we can try to date her.

44
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,666
Silence!

45
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,791
Since modern school
is all about practical work,

46
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,291
each one of you will have
to bring a nightshade

47
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,458
so we can see the differences.

48
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:25,250
Which are the nightshades?

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,250
Are there mosquitoes here?

50
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:31,166
Pay attention,
this is a difficult subject.

51
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:36,000
Nightshades are: peppers, eggplants,
zucchini, and tomatoes.

52
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,458
And nothing else.

53
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,958
- Who is there?
- Guess.

54
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,833
- Who is there?
- Prof. Malimonti.

55
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:48,583
Did you tell her that I was here?

56
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:50,833
- Prof. Cacioppo!
- Oh, my God!

57
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:55,166
- Prof. Cacioppo! Where is he?
- He was just here.

58
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,458
- Prof. Cacioppo?
- Professor?

59
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,625
What the... Good morning, Professor.

60
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,583
I thought you saw me
in the staff room.

61
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:07,250
But then you ran away.

62
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,750
Those demons can't be left alone.

63
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:16,791
To wish you a happy school year,

64
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,833
I brought you these flowers
that I got in my garden.

65
00:06:22,166 --> 00:06:25,625
- Do you recognize them?
- Yes, they are myosotis.

66
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,250
Also known as forget-me-nots.

67
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,083
- No, I will write it down.
- Professor!

68
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:36,083
You are always so cheerful,
this is why I like you.

69
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,958
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

70
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,166
See you soon.

71
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,500
You can stay seated!

72
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:51,125
- Salvatore, the chalk.
- Yes, Professor. Here.

73
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:53,833
My hand is broken again.

74
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,416
Hello, is this the principal
of Mamiani High School?

75
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,333
This is the police.

76
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:08,083
Our informants told us

77
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,791
that there are drugs in your school.

78
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,958
Drugs? In my school?

79
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:17,333
Impossible! It must be a mistake.

80
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:21,166
It's not a mistake,
we know what we are doing.

81
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,208
And we also know
there is a professor who sells it.

82
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:28,958
<i>- Prof. Cacioppo.</i>
- He is one of our best teachers.

83
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:31,875
I have known him for years.

84
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:35,041
He is the most simple
and honest person there is.

85
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:39,458
He is smart.
You don't know people like that.

86
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:43,208
They hide it
in the most unthinkable places.

87
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,583
<i>- Even in their buttocks.</i>
- In the bottom of what?

88
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,291
No, behind. Do you understand me?

89
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:54,208
Don't let him leave, we will arrest him.

90
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,791
- Yes, I will take care of that.
<i>- We are on our way.</i>

91
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,000
Here he comes.

92
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,166
Let me through! Let me through!

93
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,583
- Hurry! The principal!
- What happened?

94
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,583
Come in!

95
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:33,333
It is really unbelievable.

96
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:37,791
And so you do trips
and make people take trips.

97
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:41,416
- I haven't left in two years.
- Don't try to be smart.

98
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,750
You know what I am talking about.

99
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,666
Do you understand
the gravity of the situation?

100
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,166
I am doing this for you
and also for the school.

101
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,250
Thank you.

102
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,666
- Is this clear?
- I didn't understand the last word.

103
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,083
Let it out of the bag!

104
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:06,333
- Just tell me where it is...
- Stop being silly!

105
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,958
Tell the truth, spit it out.

106
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:12,208
- Spit it out.
- Why are you making me do this?

107
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:15,000
- Spit it out.
- As you want.

108
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,000
What are you doing?

109
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:26,083
I am helping you. Don't you see
that you are in great danger?

110
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:30,708
- Where are you keeping it?
- Where do I have it?

111
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:36,125
If the police find out first,
we will all pay for this.

112
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,291
What do the police care about
where I keep it?

113
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:43,541
I will show you where you keep it.
Come on, down with your pants!

114
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,708
Unbutton them! Salvatore!

115
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,000
Yes, Mr. Principal.

116
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:59,375
- But...
- It is an order! Do it!

117
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:22,125
Hello? Am I talking to the principal?
It's the police again.

118
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:28,291
I want to rectify.
Mr. Principal, about the drugs,

119
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,875
we got the wrong school,
professor and hideout.

120
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,583
Compose yourself.

121
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,666
You can dress yourself.

122
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,250
I am glad to see

123
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,333
that this is a safe place

124
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:53,166
and that you, Cacioppo,
are a clean person.

125
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,000
- Congratulations.
- Tha...

126
00:10:56,166 --> 00:11:01,000
Go. Go back to your kids, please.

127
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,958
Should I?

128
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:16,666
- Mr. Principal...
- 491, 492,

129
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,041
493, 494,

130
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,875
- 495...
- And you are even a sporty person!

131
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,500
Since you are new in this metropolis,

132
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,500
do you want me to take you
on a night tour of Trani?

133
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:35,833
We could go to Folies Bergère,
Moulin Rouge, have dinner at Chez Maxim's

134
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:40,208
or do you prefer a tête-à-tête
on the Hilton terrace?

135
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,166
- Is there a Hilton in Trani?
- No, but I will build one for you.

136
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,416
Tonight I have an invitation
at the British court.

137
00:11:56,666 --> 00:11:59,333
Here he goes, Casanova in action.

138
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,833
- What does she have more than us?
- Everything.

139
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,583
The small, big jerk talked.

140
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:09,333
Since Mario is busy,
would you like to come to my place?

141
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:11,666
Really! Both of us together?

142
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,583
- Are you horny?
- Silly. I am giving a party.

143
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:21,250
That's too bad, we have a date with Mario
to study all together.

144
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,708
- I am sorry.
- Another time.

145
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:28,791
First quality stuff.
Coming from Paris and Canosa.

146
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:33,250
Look how much it suits you,
this is a perfect dress for you.

147
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,500
You have a fit body,

148
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:39,250
I will put two stitches here
and it will be perfect.

149
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,583
This is horrible on you.

150
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:45,583
Mind your own business,
someone else has to wear it.

151
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:50,583
Miss Rosa, if you put on a strapless bra

152
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,833
the girls will stay up on their own.

153
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:56,750
Let's go to the fitting room
to try them both out.

154
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:00,833
- These boobs are something else...
- I will take care of her.

155
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,916
This damn wretched soul.

156
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,166
How did my wife choose her?
She is coming from the Gestapo.

157
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,833
Every time that I get red,
because I am about to...

158
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,458
She comes and then I am done.

159
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,375
Miss Rosa.

160
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,666
Here.
Careful.

161
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,333
Look what a bosom!

162
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,666
- I am getting thirsty!
- Drink then.

163
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,250
Give me a drink.

164
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,958
Mario! Do you know her?
She is a knockout!

165
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:38,583
I know her, nothing special.
I have seen better.

166
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,166
Let me look as well.

167
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,583
She is such a knockout! Come see!

168
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:52,833
- Yes!
- Come!

169
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,583
My goodness!

170
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,458
She is coming to the shop.

171
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:06,666
- Who is she, Miss Goodness?
- Yes! To the hole!

172
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,208
- To the hole!
- Come on!

173
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,708
Who are you? The blue balls fairy?

174
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:26,083
Good morning, Miss. It's an honor.

175
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,458
I'm Teo D'Olivo Magliulo.

176
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:30,583
What a...

177
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:35,083
We have clothes for men, women.
All good, round stuff.

178
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:39,000
Since I am sure
that you will be coming a lot,

179
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:42,541
why don't you give me your name
so I can write it down?

180
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:46,250
- My name is Elena Mancuso.
- Mancuso.

181
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,583
A good northern name!

182
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:51,583
Elena, miss...

183
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:54,541
How can someone not think
about Helen of Troy?

184
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:58,125
Right. How not to?

185
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,083
How not to? I don't know.

186
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:09,083
Mr. Teo, what do you think
about this dress?

187
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:12,833
Does it make me look fat
because it is white?

188
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:17,750
No... What are you talking about?
It's the end of the world!

189
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:22,375
There is a pocket in front
and a pocket behind.

190
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:26,333
I would make you a dress
that goes under here.

191
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,916
Under your bosom.
My goodness, what boobs!

192
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,166
I would make you...

193
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:37,125
- Hey, you. Listen.
- What do you want? Who are you?

194
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,458
- Her husband.
- Hers?

195
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,666
- Mancuso?
- Sicilian.

196
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,375
I was taking her measurements
but I prefer men.

197
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:54,416
You have such a body...

198
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,666
- Start from where you were.
- I was under her...

199
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,666
Mr. Teo,
did the new swimming suits arrive?

200
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,416
Miss Piuma. Pardon.

201
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,916
How are you? Is your husband doing fine?

202
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,625
Come, I will show you a dress
just arrived from New York.

203
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
Look, it is the end of the world.

204
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:18,208
Brown is really good on you.

205
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,833
- She is a customer, Piuma.
- He is queer.

206
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:23,125
That's even better.

207
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:26,541
This old one never stops talking?

208
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:30,416
- When is she leaving?
- Hurry, we want the hottie!

209
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,750
- I will go check it out.
- Don't close the hole.

210
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:40,250
- Finally, she is leaving!
- We can see better from here.

211
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,500
Here she comes!

212
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,625
Jee, she got fat!

213
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:48,583
We can shorten it up to the knee.

214
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,166
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, dear.

215
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,291
Or we can take this one...

216
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,958
It is a little too daring.

217
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:00,000
Because your wife
is always fully covered, right?

218
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:05,375
Are you jealous?
Your wife should be jealous of you

219
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:10,166
because you are so fascinating,
you look like Omar Sharif.

220
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:16,541
When you get something more appropriate
for my wife we will come back.

221
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,416
Yes, come back.

222
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,416
Elena, let's go!

223
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,291
- Bye.
- Bye!

224
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:30,291
- What were you saying?
- Dad, are you feeling well?

225
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:36,208
I have to pretend to be a faggot
with these few customers

226
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:41,416
that I would actually like to kill!

227
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,583
Why do you work? Mom is a lawyer
and makes money for all three of us.

228
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:51,416
And I am from Scandinavia!
Your mother works and I am her pimp.

229
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,166
Your mother is a feminist
and I am a "malist".

230
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,166
- Thank God, I was scared.
- I will slap you.

231
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,666
Go, Simona!

232
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,291
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

233
00:18:28,666 --> 00:18:30,166
Good job, Simona!

234
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:47,333
- Got you! Give me a kiss!
- Let go of me, silly!

235
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:54,250
Give me that ball!
Let's be calm, this isn't a war.

236
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:56,500
This is a basketball game.

237
00:18:56,583 --> 00:19:00,500
Let's try to be fair
without killing anyone.

238
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,375
- Excuse me.
- Don't worry.

239
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:16,708
Put me down!

240
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,791
Go, Simona!

241
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,291
- Foul!
- I saw it, it's a foul!

242
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,708
- Shut up, he said it already!
- Let's do it again, I liked it!

243
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:36,625
- Do it to your sister, jerk!
- I will expel you!

244
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:41,000
- What happened?
- He called the referee a jerk.

245
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,708
- Me?
- No, me.

246
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,041
So? The ball!

247
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,875
Ready? Go!

248
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:50,375
Get the basketball. Turn it.

249
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,083
Salvatore!

250
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,916
- Let go of it!
- They put glue on it.

251
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,166
Glue?

252
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,166
- Is there another ball?
- No!

253
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,041
The game is over, then.

254
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:14,708
Careful with Mario.
He was nice with us as well.

255
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:19,125
He told me that I was his first love.

256
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,458
- If I were you, I wouldn't date him.
- Sure.

257
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,041
He likes you because you are new.

258
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,791
Once he gets what he wants,
he will dump you.

259
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:32,041
Mario is really dangerous then.

260
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:36,250
- Aren't you a little jealous?
- Yes.

261
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:44,416
Before you fall for him as well,
let's trick him

262
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,458
and make him look ridiculous
in front of the whole school.

263
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,583
- Are you in?
- Of course,

264
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:53,000
If it's for the sake of us women.
What joke are you thinking about?

265
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:57,083
Pretend that you live
in a house that I will give you.

266
00:20:57,166 --> 00:21:02,750
Make up a sad story, make him fall in love
and then make him go to the gym.

267
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,708
- We will take care of the rest.
- All right.

268
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:08,791
Very nice. This is a classic eggplant.

269
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:12,875
Delicate to cook, but easy because
you can also avoid putting salt in it.

270
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:15,208
Good. Go to your place. Put it away.

271
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,166
Girardi... Girardi brought a potato.

272
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:25,416
A Dutch one. Long and white. Good job!

273
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,875
It's scientific name is tuber,
don't forget it, it's important.

274
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,166
- Good job, Simona. Put it in.
- Put it in.

275
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,750
- You?
- I brought this.

276
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,250
Good job, Martocchia,
you're always joking.

277
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:42,958
You brought a cabbage.

278
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,333
This isn't a nightshade
so I will give you an F.

279
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,458
Go sit down.
So you'll learn not to be silly.

280
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,750
Guys, the lesson is over.

281
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:58,791
Did you all give me the vegetables?
Good job, goodbye.

282
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:03,083
- Why didn't the bell ring?
- One thing at a time.

283
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:07,208
The bell must ring on time.
She got in and surprised me.

284
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:11,708
The bell is needed so one professor
gets in and another one leaves.

285
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:16,666
This time it is not Salvatore's fault,
I came in too early.

286
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,375
Go, Salvatore.

287
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:25,000
- The bell.
- Why are you in a rush?

288
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:29,083
- I'm sorry!
- Don't worry. I get some fresh air.

289
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,375
They make bad fabrics nowadays.

290
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:35,375
You're getting always more reserved,
I don't ever see you.

291
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:40,083
I just got this jacket,
what will I do now?

292
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:43,500
Come to my place tonight, I can sew it up.

293
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:46,958
No, thank you.

294
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:51,750
- Now I have a summer jacket.
- Then we can play pool.

295
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:55,833
I must mark the assignments.

296
00:22:55,916 --> 00:23:00,750
We could have been a good couple at pool.

297
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:04,666
I shoot and you come closer...

298
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:11,333
Don't miss the movie in TV,
<i>Somebody Up There Likes Me.</i>

299
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:14,291
You'd need a climber.

300
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:17,458
- Goodbye, Professor.
- Goodb... No, thank you.

301
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,833
He's shy!

302
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:28,666
Sit down.

303
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:34,541
No, guys. This isn't working.

304
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,375
You wanted a composition of your choice,

305
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,833
but other than Santarelli,
who wrote about Giolitti,

306
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:43,416
all of you chose absurd subjects.

307
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:48,958
But the most provocative one
is Martocchia's.

308
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:51,166
- Present.
- Yes, yours.

309
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:56,041
You wrote about the importance of thighs
in modern society!

310
00:23:57,291 --> 00:24:02,625
Silence! Now after having picked
the subject you can choose the grade.

311
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:06,791
- Do you want F or F-?
- Why can't I get a better grade?

312
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:10,708
- Make a better composition then.
- How funny!

313
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:14,958
Guys, you have to understand
that you are in high school.

314
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:18,708
I will let you hear
what your classmate wrote.

315
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:26,083
I appreciate absoluteness,
even absolute stupidity.

316
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:30,375
If you confess it was you,
I won't even punish you.

317
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:34,791
There's a mouse around here. Here it is!

318
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:40,208
- Don't worry, it's fake.
- I thought so.

319
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:50,416
I don't have a scooter.
Can you take me home?

320
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,333
I prefer not to.
They like to gossip around here.

321
00:24:54,416 --> 00:24:58,333
But I can come see you.
Give me your address.

322
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:00,833
- Is 5:00 all right?
- Okay.

323
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,625
Salvatore!

324
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,791
Salvatore! Salvatore!

325
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,916
Here he is!

326
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,750
Salvatore! Come, there is a mouse!

327
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,000
- A mouse!
- Where is it?

328
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:18,791
Here it is, do you see it?

329
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:24,375
- What? Are you shaking?
- Of course, it's cold in here!

330
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
- Bye.
- See you later.

331
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:32,416
- They aren't talking to you.
- They don't care about us.

332
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,916
- Isn't he coming with you?
- No, but it's a good sign.

333
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,416
He's always bragging,
but this time he's being reserved.

334
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:44,083
But if he won't come,
you don't need that house.

335
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:47,333
He's coming to my place at 5:00.

336
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:49,583
- Good job!
- Lucky you.

337
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:53,791
Don't say stupid things!
We have more time to get ready.

338
00:25:53,875 --> 00:25:57,333
Each one of us
must do their part without mercy.

339
00:25:57,416 --> 00:26:01,625
This also includes you.
Don't you try to betray us.

340
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:04,625
- Do we agree?
- Okay.

341
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:06,458
- Bye.
- Bye.

342
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:11,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

343
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,000
- I'm Federico.
- And I'm Simona.

344
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:18,708
- What do you do, Simona?
- I study, and you?

345
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:21,500
I drive. Come, I'll give you a ride.

346
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,500
- Where are we going?
- To the old pine woods. Thank you.

347
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:33,666
Okay.

348
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:40,416
- It must be a bad life.
- Mine? And why?

349
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,583
Not yours. The taxi driver's life.

350
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:45,250
Maybe they want to go
to the new pine woods

351
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,041
but they have to go to the new.

352
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:51,750
- They are always around.
- Yes, but it's their job.

353
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:55,750
One should pick their job,
do only what they want to do.

354
00:26:56,583 --> 00:27:00,000
You said a big truth, you're clever.

355
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:01,500
I'm a genius, actually.

356
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:08,333
Here it is.

357
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:13,166
- Thank you.
- Do you want me to wait for you?

358
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,500
- No, it will take me four or five hours.
- All right, maybe I'll see you again.

359
00:27:16,583 --> 00:27:18,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

360
00:27:32,916 --> 00:27:36,166
<i>Vidal shower gel, an extract of pine tree</i>

361
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,583
<i>which creates a rich and active lather.</i>

362
00:27:38,666 --> 00:27:41,041
<i>Vidal charges you with vitality...</i>

363
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:44,500
- Salvatore, is this you?
- No, it's Santa.

364
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,000
Did you see?

365
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,416
You're late. Did you stop to chat?

366
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,750
No, I'm tired
of taking this stuff all the time.

367
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:57,500
- It's your idea.
- I'm the head and you're the arm.

368
00:27:57,583 --> 00:28:01,750
Do you want
a professor with a 15-year career

369
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,958
to take vegetables from school
to his house?

370
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:08,083
Do you remember
what your father said before leaving town?

371
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:11,375
Check on Salvatore, make him work.

372
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:14,666
- Yes, but this is too much.
- I'm hungry, hand me the tomatoes.

373
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,333
Hand me the tomatoes!

374
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,833
Here, the tomatoes.

375
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:23,750
Do you know what happened in 3rd B?

376
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:25,750
- What?
- There was a mouse!

377
00:28:25,833 --> 00:28:30,666
All girls were screaming
and pulling their skirts up.

378
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,833
The mouse wouldn't leave
and all skirts were still up.

379
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:39,333
Salvatore, clean the tomatoes
and hand me the carrots.

380
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:48,583
And there is something more...

381
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:50,916
- What?
- Nothing, good job.

382
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,166
When I see women with their skirts up...

383
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:57,833
I can't do it anymore,
my strength goes down.

384
00:28:57,916 --> 00:29:01,541
All girls standing on their desks

385
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:05,041
and with their skirts up,
I went there on purpose.

386
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:07,583
In my hometown I didn't see that.

387
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:11,500
That mouse was such fun for me.

388
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:16,541
You always think about women?
In every woman there is a scam.

389
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:20,291
- That's what I like.
- You'll get scammed again.

390
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:25,000
- Give me a celery, get the carrots.
- Give celery, clean carrots.

391
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:33,416
Are you a telegraphist?
Forget about veggies.

392
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,583
Let's make an omelet.

393
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:38,625
- Do we have eggs?
- Yes.

394
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,916
Here they are.

395
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,916
An omelet...
Mom is right, eggs are heavy.

396
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,958
We can't take stuff from school anymore.

397
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:54,000
These kids have no respect for anyone.

398
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:57,583
Did you set the alarm?

399
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:08,958
- Oh, my God!
- See you up there.

400
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:18,416
Careful.

401
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:28,916
It looks good.

402
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,458
You know what? I am not hungry anymore.

403
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,083
- Yes?
- <i>It's me.</i>

404
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,333
- Hi.
- How quick! Did you run?

405
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:33,333
It's good for a stroke.

406
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,083
This place is nice.
Do you live here alone?

407
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,666
No, with my mother.

408
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,833
But she is never home, she's a nanny.

409
00:31:45,708 --> 00:31:49,541
We moved here to follow her employers.

410
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:52,833
Does your mom come home late at night?

411
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,375
It depends.

412
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:58,000
Tonight she will not come home at all.

413
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:01,125
Her employers went to the theater, so...

414
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:05,875
- Aren't you afraid of being alone?
- Yes, a little bit.

415
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:15,333
It is not right that a pretty girl
like you lives like that.

416
00:32:15,416 --> 00:32:19,166
It is pretty here,
but you deserve much more.

417
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,666
- Do you really like me, Mario?
- So much.

418
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,916
But you are used to many pretty girls.

419
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,333
No, they don't matter.

420
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:31,833
I love you.

421
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:36,500
Please, if it is a lie,
don't say it to me.

422
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,083
It would hurt me.

423
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:42,125
I swear it's true, believe me.

424
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:54,166
- Mario, what are you doing?
- Simona, what do you want me to do?

425
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:58,291
No, no...

426
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:01,916
- Mario, no.
- I love you.

427
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:16,333
- Who is there?
- It's us.

428
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:19,208
- Oh, my God, Vera.
- I am coming.

429
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:29,500
Hi, Simona, how are you?
We didn't know you had company.

430
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:35,250
- I am here by accident.
- He brought back a literature book.

431
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:40,416
- Yes.
- Good, tomorrow we have Latin literature.

432
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:46,833
- I brought you that light to study.
- Thank you. How nice!

433
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:52,000
If you don't get offended,
I brought you butter and milk...

434
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:55,750
some orange juice...

435
00:33:56,541 --> 00:34:00,583
and a roasted chicken.
We knew that you don't have much.

436
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:04,333
- And your mother doesn't have time.
- Thank you, how nice!

437
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,625
I am leaving.

438
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:08,833
- As you prefer.
- Yes, we are here.

439
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:11,208
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

440
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:14,833
- Mario, what do you have behind you?
- I don't know.

441
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:23,333
- See? We arrived in time.
- Yes, just barely.

442
00:34:23,416 --> 00:34:26,000
We won the first round.

443
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:30,000
My father will not rent this place,
I told him that we come here to study.

444
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:33,916
Yes, study how to trick Mario.

445
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:50,000
Hi.

446
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:01,833
- Hi.
- We meet again.

447
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:03,750
We meet often.

448
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:07,500
If we were in New York,
it would be more difficult, but here...

449
00:35:08,041 --> 00:35:12,000
- Where should I take you?
- Let's go this way, thank you.

450
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,291
- Can you wait?
- Hurry, my butt hurts.

451
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:32,375
I will fly.

452
00:35:50,416 --> 00:35:52,666
- Good evening.
- Hi, are they at the table?

453
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,250
- Yes.
- Thank you.

454
00:35:57,583 --> 00:35:59,666
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, dear.

455
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:03,416
- Hi, Mom.
- We are going to the theater.

456
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,583
- What do you have on your head?
- It's a new hairdo.

457
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,000
I am not dressed yet, so I can save it.

458
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:14,416
- With this foulard I can save it.
- It's some kind of a monument

459
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,250
that is yet to be displayed
and still covered with a curtain.

460
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:21,833
Shut up, butcher!
You know nothing about fashion.

461
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,916
Here talked milady.

462
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,416
Give me my Fernet-Branca.

463
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,500
- You don't want to eat?
- No, I will get ready and leave.

464
00:36:30,583 --> 00:36:32,416
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

465
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,416
Bye, honey. Who are you going out with?

466
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,458
- A friend of mine.
- Don't be late.

467
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:41,166
We will wait up for you.

468
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:44,625
You fall asleep
ten minutes before going to bed!

469
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:53,041
I have an idea for the movie.

470
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:55,166
- Tell me more.
- It's a backwards story.

471
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:58,583
A mother brainwashed by her rich boss

472
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:02,666
is saved by her daughter
who seduces the boss.

473
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,666
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

474
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:08,833
As soon as I find the money,
I will make it.

475
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:12,250
Enough of these commercial movies

476
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:15,958
that make only the producers get rich.

477
00:37:16,041 --> 00:37:18,208
An artistic movie would be better.

478
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:22,916
Not just that,
we need a movie to set a new pace.

479
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,291
I always say that to those rich men
without even an idea.

480
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:32,041
- Get me some wine. Hi, Federico.
- Hi.

481
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:35,083
That is Minghetti, a sculptor.

482
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:40,416
He is a jerk. He still makes
natural statues with tits and asses.

483
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,125
Do you know Bernini,
Michelangelo and Brunelleschi?

484
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:48,958
- And he does all that?
- No, he makes even uglier stuff.

485
00:37:49,041 --> 00:37:53,875
- Do you want to eat something else?
- No. It was a lot of pizza.

486
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:59,125
I don't like their pizza
but I come here to have fun.

487
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:11,250
- Be patient, we are about to close.
- Add it to my tab, then.

488
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:14,375
- No, you don't have a tab anymore.
- Just remember then.

489
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,541
- It doesn't matter, I will pay.
- Good job, yes.

490
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,583
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing, I don't speak well.

491
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:30,833
You have one minute!

492
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:41,333
- It's the blonde one from the shop.
- My heart is going faster.

493
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:48,000
- She gets more beautiful every day.
- Did you see what a stunner?

494
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:54,125
No...

495
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:11,000
- Guys, look Salvatore.
- I would rather look at her.

496
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,416
He is eating her with his eyes.

497
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,666
- Her husband would kill him.
- Is he jealous?

498
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:25,250
He chases her with his bodyguards.

499
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:29,291
We have to give him a lesson.

500
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:32,833
- A good one.
- Why? I would be jealous too.

501
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:37,166
- I'm talking about Salvatore.
- Come on! Yes!

502
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,416
Let's hide...

503
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:47,458
- Salvatore! The bell.
- What are you... The bell!

504
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:52,666
- A girl came, she was naked.
- My goodness.

505
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:57,541
Then a second one arrived
and she was naked, and a third one too.

506
00:39:57,625 --> 00:40:01,083
They were all naked? What did you do?

507
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:04,666
- Who's there?
- It's busy.

508
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:09,541
Do it all, huh?

509
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:29,166
- Is she really easy?
- Yes, I have already slept with her.

510
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:33,208
- Who is she?
- That beautiful lady

511
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:37,416
that every morning comes
to the building near here.

512
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,458
- She goes to Rocco Mancuso.
- Are you talking about that stunner?

513
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,833
- I will try to sleep with her too.
- Yes, you need a good plan.

514
00:40:45,916 --> 00:40:49,333
If you talk to her in the street,
she will not reply.

515
00:40:49,416 --> 00:40:54,583
You follow her to her house
and you go in the elevator behind her.

516
00:40:54,666 --> 00:40:55,875
She is a nymphomaniac.

517
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:59,208
As soon as you are alone,
she will make love to you.

518
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,000
- In the elevator?
- Yes!

519
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:04,083
She will stop it in between floors
and jump on you.

520
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:15,583
Good morning, I was waiting for you.

521
00:41:15,666 --> 00:41:18,625
- Did something happen?
- Not yet.

522
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:20,500
This is embarrassing, right?

523
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:26,000
But it is also exciting,
being together alone in this room.

524
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:31,333
I must confess
that I feel a shiver down my spine.

525
00:41:31,416 --> 00:41:35,666
- You must have a fever.
- How funny!

526
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,500
- Don't be shy.
- No.

527
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:44,375
I know you, I see how you look at me.

528
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:47,833
Let yourself go, Professor.

529
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:50,833
Without any hesitation.

530
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:54,791
Don't you run away from me.

531
00:41:55,666 --> 00:42:00,833
You're such an introvert,
let go of your inhibitions.

532
00:42:00,916 --> 00:42:03,500
Come on, jump on me!

533
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:08,250
If you want to kiss me, do it.

534
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:11,791
What are you waiting for? Do it!

535
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:18,583
Finally you have given up,
now you are mine!

536
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:25,500
- What are you doing here?
- It is Prof. Cacioppo.

537
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:30,000
He fainted and I was trying to help him.

538
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:34,916
- Come on, it's nothing!
- Are you also going to beat me up?

539
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,458
- No, wait. I will drive it.
- All right.

540
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:53,750
- Isn't Mario coming?
- You can't count on him.

541
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:56,791
- He was talking to Simona.
- He is in love then.

542
00:43:32,291 --> 00:43:38,500
The joke scared Prof. Cacioppo.
Yesterday we did another one.

543
00:43:38,583 --> 00:43:40,833
- Which one?
- The one with the pinwheel.

544
00:43:41,916 --> 00:43:45,208
- She got him good.
- I hope that he doesn't get her.

545
00:43:49,083 --> 00:43:50,875
That would be vile.

546
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:55,583
I see, but having seen
how delicate this is

547
00:43:55,666 --> 00:44:01,375
it would be fair that our meeting
may be held by the superintendent.

548
00:44:01,458 --> 00:44:04,083
I will tell him.

549
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:06,833
- Does anyone object?
- It's fine for me.

550
00:44:06,916 --> 00:44:10,458
As long as it won't rain
or we will be screwed up.

551
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:14,000
There is a woman here, come on.

552
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:17,375
Sorry, I meant that with a shitty weather
we would get ruined.

553
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:22,250
All right. Santarelli,
read the verbal of the meeting.

554
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:26,250
- What?
- Read it.

555
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:29,916
"Today, etcetera etcetera,
the faculty council, etcetera,

556
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,083
for the 15th anniversary
of Prof. Ilario Cacioppo, proposes:

557
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:39,916
starter, fettuccine, roast with potatoes,
cheese, fruit and sweets.

558
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,833
Ten thousand lira a person,
restaurant to be decided."

559
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:47,666
- Any objections?
- Perfect.

560
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:50,833
Mr. Principal, I have another idea.

561
00:44:50,916 --> 00:44:55,541
- Tell me.
- Why the usual lunch?

562
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:57,916
We could celebrate the professor

563
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,208
with something more modern,
dynamic and cheerful.

564
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:05,500
A little bit of music,
we dance a little bit.

565
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:07,291
Trust me.

566
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:11,666
As long as we don't get wet.
Pour it in the glass.

567
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,291
- You are jinxing me.
- Me?

568
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:18,166
Why did I have to end up
with Popeye's daughter?

569
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:21,500
You can't say no to her,
if she touches you, you are dead.

570
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:29,708
Salvatore!

571
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:36,541
This is a procession.

572
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:47,583
Good morning, Madam.

573
00:45:47,666 --> 00:45:49,750
- Where are you going?
- I am with her.

574
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,291
- Go on.
- Thank you.

575
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,166
- Pardon. Should I do it or you?
- I am going to the penthouse.

576
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:01,416
I know.

577
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:06,083
This is a dream, I will never forget it.

578
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:09,375
I believe you! Me too.

579
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:20,000
- Here I come.
- How can I help you?

580
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,809
- I think I went to the wrong floor.
- I think that everything is wrong.

581
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:27,250
- I think so too.
- Get in.

582
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,666
- Do you think they killed him?
- No, it would be a problem.

583
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,916
They don't want us to talk...

584
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,875
We'd better disappear.
It doesn't work without Mario.

585
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,666
What doesn't work?

586
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:44,500
- Good morning, Professor.
- Good morning.

587
00:47:44,583 --> 00:47:50,208
- What are you doing here?
- We are getting some fresh air.

588
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:54,125
I didn't think about it.
I can't believe it.

589
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:58,000
Next Sunday I will come for a stroll here.

590
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:00,958
You are here, where Salvatore got in.

591
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:06,416
- We were wondering where he went.
- What do you care?

592
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,583
- We are just curious.
- Yes?

593
00:48:09,666 --> 00:48:13,541
If you tricked him, I will kick your ass.

594
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:16,666
- No, no tricks.
- We never do such things.

595
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:21,083
- Goodbye, Professor.
- See you soon.

596
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,916
Where did he go?

597
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:40,166
- Get me.
- Salvatore. What did you do?

598
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,250
- Wake up.
- Nothing, am I dead?

599
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:45,333
- No, you are just a jerk.
- That's better.

600
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:06,333
- I am warm, what about you?
- Not really.

601
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:10,583
- You are hot as well.
- What? Are you undressing me?

602
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:15,916
- Yes, I can't take it anymore.
- No, wait.

603
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:19,916
I don't want to feel forced.

604
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,916
Look, there is a hare!

605
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:38,791
- Armando! Look.
- What the...

606
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:44,583
- Did you see that chick?
- What do I care? I don't shoot chickens!

607
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:57,708
These are formulas, numbers,
very small doses...

608
00:49:57,791 --> 00:50:01,875
Sometimes experiments succeed
and other times they don't.

609
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:06,041
- He wants to drink everything.
- My goodness...

610
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:12,791
I contacted the Animal Protection
so that they would give you a medal.

611
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:16,000
You saved the hare.
The hunters were looking at you.

612
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:20,166
But the hare saved me.

613
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,750
Guys...

614
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:27,541
Don't forget to study
the chemical formulas I explained to you.

615
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:33,416
Next time I will ask you about them.
Don't forget about it. Bye.

616
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:36,083
Stay seated.

617
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,958
- Prof. Cacioppo.
- Prof. Malimonti.

618
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:40,583
Did you notice

619
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:43,791
that whenever we see each other,
the bells are ringing?

620
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,750
As if it is Easter!

621
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:51,625
- He is distracted.
- Do you still have that powder?

622
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:53,416
- Of course.
- Let's go.

623
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:58,166
- How is it going with Mario?
- Very well, he is in love.

624
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,500
He will take me for a ride today.

625
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:02,333
- Good job!
- It's working!

626
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,833
Wait, I ran to get here in time

627
00:51:11,916 --> 00:51:15,291
because I wanted your opinion.

628
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:18,250
- Do you like this new dress of mine?
- It is beautiful.

629
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:22,666
- I wore it just for you.
- Otherwise you'd go around naked?

630
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:26,708
You always like to joke around.

631
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:30,333
I'm trying to be elegant for you.

632
00:51:31,916 --> 00:51:34,708
Do you know where I got it?

633
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:40,041
In the boutique of our student, D'Olivo.

634
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:42,083
Do you know it?

635
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:44,250
They have
beautiful clothes for men as well.

636
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:49,041
Why don't you try to go there?

637
00:51:49,125 --> 00:51:52,083
- Go there.
- Yes, I will go there right away.

638
00:51:52,166 --> 00:51:54,500
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

639
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,500
This car is so beautiful.

640
00:52:26,583 --> 00:52:29,916
- It belongs to my mother.
- Does she let you drive it?

641
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,375
She went to Milan by train
so that I could have it.

642
00:52:36,416 --> 00:52:37,833
Mothers...

643
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:48,500
I like you because you are a good girl.

644
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:51,250
You are a good guy as well.

645
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:09,833
But if you do this...

646
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:14,916
You think about nothing but this.
You worry me.

647
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,750
You should be worried if I didn't.
Did you look at yourself?

648
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:23,791
- You are exaggerating.
- You are a knockout.

649
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:30,583
- Come on, be good.
- What do you mean?

650
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:41,833
I have to plant my seeds here.
Can you do it somewhere else?

651
00:53:41,916 --> 00:53:47,125
- See? How embarrassing. Sorry.
- I am going.

652
00:53:48,666 --> 00:53:52,750
Sooner or later
they'll come to screw in my house!

653
00:53:57,833 --> 00:53:59,833
- Bye.
- Bye.

654
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:03,833
Sorry, I forgot. See if you like it.

655
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:09,291
- It is beautiful.
- Why don't you wear it?

656
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:13,583
Here, in the middle of the street?
What should I tell my mother?

657
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:17,541
That a friend gave it to you
and you'll wear it at Cacioppo's party.

658
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:21,250
- When will I meet your mother?
- Soon.

659
00:54:21,333 --> 00:54:24,666
Not tonight.
Her employers are having a party.

660
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:29,333
- You will be alone then.
- Please, don't start again.

661
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,583
Just a kiss to thank you and good night.

662
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:35,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

663
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:08,208
Simona! What are you looking at?

664
00:55:08,291 --> 00:55:12,666
- Hi, Federico!
- Hi. I haven't seen you in a while.

665
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,750
A friend of mine arrived
and I have been busy.

666
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:20,833
- Male or female friend?
- No, I am working so much.

667
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:23,166
Let me show you my office.

668
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:27,583
I can't tonight.
I asked my father to come pick me up.

669
00:55:27,666 --> 00:55:32,041
- Here he comes. Wait, Dad.
- Hurry up, it's late.

670
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:34,583
I will give you the address.

671
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:38,916
If you want to come see me,
I will show you my house.

672
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:41,666
- Here.
- It is an idea.

673
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:44,833
Simona!
If you find me, it means I'm there!

674
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:47,583
- Bye, you crazy person!
- Bye!

675
00:55:47,666 --> 00:55:49,416
Let's go!

676
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:56,666
What a car! Maybe I have found the money!

677
00:55:56,750 --> 00:56:01,333
Mario, you have been so kind.
But she dodged you again.

678
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,250
Aren't you a little too kind?

679
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:08,291
No, because now I will turn around.

680
00:56:13,166 --> 00:56:15,500
- Where are you going?
- To meet your sister!

681
00:56:30,583 --> 00:56:34,083
Look what you did
to look at that whore with that old man.

682
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:37,750
Look! Get down, jerk!

683
00:56:38,583 --> 00:56:40,583
He is right, I am a jerk.

684
00:56:40,666 --> 00:56:44,000
Let's go, hurry up!

685
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:46,625
Every morning it's like this.

686
00:56:46,708 --> 00:56:48,583
Hurry up!

687
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:54,208
Hurry, you are late!

688
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:59,333
- We are coming.
- Salvatore!

689
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:04,666
You are full of Band-Aids.
She didn't want to sleep with you, huh?

690
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:09,333
Yes, only your sister is always willing
to sleep with me.

691
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:12,250
Come on, it's late!

692
00:57:14,791 --> 00:57:19,333
Poor Salvatore!
He still carries the signs of the stunner!

693
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:23,458
Who? The Sicilian one?
Yesterday she came to the shop

694
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:27,708
and maybe she will come today too
because the new models are arriving.

695
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:30,416
- We will come to you then.
- Do what you want.

696
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,083
We are going there today,

697
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:34,750
but don't act too horny or
I will not take you.

698
00:57:35,666 --> 00:57:39,250
- Come in.
- Can I?

699
00:57:39,333 --> 00:57:41,833
- Come.
- What?

700
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:44,416
- They want you on the phone.
- Who is it?

701
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,041
Sorry, I didn't ask.

702
00:57:48,291 --> 00:57:49,791
Let's look each other in the eyes.

703
00:57:51,416 --> 00:57:56,916
Don't have people call you here,
this is an office phone.

704
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,500
- All right. Hello?
<i>- Salvatore, is this you?</i>

705
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:05,416
- Yes.
<i>- I am Elena Mancuso. Remember me?</i>

706
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:08,708
<i>- The elevator.</i>
- Yes, I remember.

707
00:58:08,791 --> 00:58:13,583
Dear little Salvatore, I am mortified.

708
00:58:13,666 --> 00:58:16,041
If you knew
what I had to do to find you...

709
00:58:16,666 --> 00:58:20,000
<i>I want to apologize for
what happened to you because of me.</i>

710
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:23,250
<i>Just to think about it, I freeze.</i>

711
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:28,125
<i>If you only knew
what my husband makes me go through.</i>

712
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:31,916
He is too jealous.

713
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,333
I want to see you to apologize.

714
00:58:36,416 --> 00:58:38,958
Salvatore. We must see each other.

715
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:41,500
Yes, it's a good idea. When? Where?

716
00:58:41,583 --> 00:58:48,291
Today at four I will go to see
some clothes at Mr. D'Olivo's shop.

717
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:53,750
<i>It sounds like a good chance.
But be cautious.</i>

718
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:57,833
<i>Wear a disguise
so no one will recognize you.</i>

719
00:58:57,916 --> 00:59:03,416
You don't need help,
you are the man around town.

720
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,750
- Will you be there?
- I will!

721
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,125
Thank you!

722
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:18,458
This is crazy.
Something serious must've happened.

723
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:21,750
Baroque was a great artistic movement

724
00:59:21,833 --> 00:59:24,833
which started
during the Counter-Reformation

725
00:59:24,916 --> 00:59:27,333
after the Renaissance.

726
00:59:27,416 --> 00:59:31,041
It had its biggest center in Rome.
Do you remember from whom?

727
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:34,500
- Two aces.
- Two aces? Who said that?

728
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:37,583
- I did.
- Wonderful, good definition.

729
00:59:37,666 --> 00:59:40,750
There were two aces:
Bernini and Borromini.

730
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:45,000
And now I'll show you
the architectonic style of the Baroque.

731
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:49,958
Looking at it,
that Paolina wasn't that good.

732
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:53,416
At least she is young,
not like your friend.

733
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,750
- What friend?
- I saw him yesterday.

734
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:58,916
He has a car and a lot of money,
but he will always be a mummy.

735
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,958
And would you tell him face to face?

736
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:05,083
- Me? I would smack him.
- Okay.

737
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:10,333
It would have happened someday.
Today I'll introduce him to you.

738
01:00:35,416 --> 01:00:36,583
Where is everyone?

739
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:41,000
- The Commander is by the pool.
- Thank you. Let's go.

740
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:43,000
She goes with a commander!

741
01:00:43,916 --> 01:00:45,250
Come, Mario.

742
01:00:50,416 --> 01:00:53,750
- Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad!
- Hi, honey!

743
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:00,666
Meet Mario, a friend of mine.

744
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:04,333
Good, dear. Come. This is your boyfriend?

745
01:01:04,416 --> 01:01:06,875
No, he sits next to me in class.

746
01:01:06,958 --> 01:01:10,291
- Why is he like this? He can't talk?
- So?

747
01:01:11,583 --> 01:01:16,291
- Are you sad that he's my father?
- No, Simona, I'm sad that you...

748
01:01:18,416 --> 01:01:21,750
How's work, Ma'am?
Did they give you a raise?

749
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:25,541
- Where's the pig that left her?
- Are you crazy?

750
01:01:25,625 --> 01:01:27,583
What is he saying?

751
01:01:29,416 --> 01:01:33,750
This house, this pool, this maid...
It's all a brothel!

752
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:38,791
Also you. And put on your britches,
you're horrible!

753
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:47,291
- What is this? Is he a communist?
- I don't know.

754
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:50,916
But he's the best boy in the world.

755
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,750
And if he was the worst in the world,
what would have happened here?

756
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:59,583
- Do you like this striped shirt?
- Yes, I like it.

757
01:01:59,666 --> 01:02:04,583
I like all of these shirts,
and I would like one for a party.

758
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:06,458
- White, then.
- Yes.

759
01:02:10,583 --> 01:02:14,500
Giuditta! The truck has arrived.

760
01:02:15,125 --> 01:02:18,750
- Sorry, I'll be back soon.
- Go, don't worry.

761
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:22,000
- One moment.
- Yes, I'm not in a hurry anyways.

762
01:02:22,083 --> 01:02:25,500
- Let me check.
- There's everything.

763
01:02:54,416 --> 01:02:58,833
- Salvato! Why did you dress like this?
- Shut up, it doesn't concern you.

764
01:02:58,916 --> 01:03:01,916
No! It concerns everyone!

765
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,083
- What an ugly dummy.
- Yeah, what about you?

766
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:13,000
- What do you say, Professor?
- It's pretty blue.

767
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:15,500
- What's blue?
- Everything.

768
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:19,958
- This is all oat color.
- Really? I see it blue.

769
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:28,791
Salvato!

770
01:03:29,541 --> 01:03:32,625
Damn it! Let's go, don't be a kid.

771
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:37,666
There's also Prof. Cacioppo.
Two birds with one stone!

772
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:41,250
- I don't care.
- You're missing something good.

773
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:42,541
Leave me alone!

774
01:03:42,625 --> 01:03:46,333
- You can't stay here.
- But I have an appointment.

775
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:58,583
- Remember, be vigilant.
- Yeah, don't worry.

776
01:03:58,666 --> 01:04:01,625
- You stay here, I'll go in the back.
- Okay.

777
01:04:01,708 --> 01:04:06,041
- I would break your...
- So, did that dress arrive?

778
01:04:06,125 --> 01:04:09,458
Mr. Mancuso, I gave you my word.
Here it is.

779
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:12,958
Damn, now also faggots have
a word of honor?

780
01:04:13,041 --> 01:04:18,500
Is he implying that I'm gay?
Let me tell you this story.

781
01:04:18,583 --> 01:04:20,333
I was in Florence, at a fashion show.

782
01:04:20,416 --> 01:04:25,000
At the station they called me
a vegetable name that I don't remember.

783
01:04:25,083 --> 01:04:27,833
- Was it celery? Carrot?
- Fennel.

784
01:04:27,916 --> 01:04:31,958
- You were in Florence before me?
- Can I try it on?

785
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:34,750
- Can she try it on?
- Go with her.

786
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:37,041
- I have to go with you?
- No, I'll do it myself.

787
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:41,250
- Now what do we do?
- You do the dummy.

788
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:44,875
Be like this.
Your arm needs to be still. A sign...

789
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:01,916
We must hurry, honey.

790
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,541
My goodness, what a twist!

791
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:24,625
Fantastic! Mario, come look.
This time it will end with gun shots.

792
01:05:24,708 --> 01:05:26,291
It'd better.

793
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:54,083
- Come on!
- I should have a fake fly.

794
01:05:55,916 --> 01:05:58,166
- Hurry!
- Calm down.

795
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:00,500
Down! Hurry!

796
01:06:00,583 --> 01:06:02,083
Come on!

797
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:17,333
Go on, Cacioppo.

798
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,583
What?

799
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,500
Did I hurt you?

800
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:48,875
- Elena! Why did you scream?
- I poked myself with a needle!

801
01:06:50,125 --> 01:06:51,750
- Close.
- Open!

802
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:54,708
- One moment!
- Open, God damn it!

803
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:56,750
Open!

804
01:06:58,625 --> 01:07:01,416
- Now!
- Good evening.

805
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:06,208
Open!

806
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:12,333
Saint Rosalia! She's dead!

807
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:16,375
She's dead, but she's always hot.

808
01:07:16,458 --> 01:07:19,000
- Mario is in love.
- And you?

809
01:07:20,041 --> 01:07:22,583
If you fall for him, it's a betrayal.

810
01:07:23,416 --> 01:07:25,583
No, don't worry.

811
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:30,250
Actually,
at this point this prank is perfect.

812
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:35,166
- Should we do it tonight?
- Yes, it's the perfect night.

813
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:40,125
Mirella, spread the word,
we'll al be there at 9 p.m.

814
01:07:41,416 --> 01:07:42,916
- Okay.
- Bye.

815
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,583
- Bye.
- Bye.

816
01:07:46,166 --> 01:07:51,333
Mario is diabolical.
He was the one that pranked you at school.

817
01:07:51,416 --> 01:07:55,000
Really?
Before I suspected him, now I'm sure.

818
01:07:55,083 --> 01:07:59,583
- We must teach him a lesson.
- You're right.

819
01:07:59,666 --> 01:08:03,708
- Tomorrow I'll kill him.
- You'll get in trouble.

820
01:08:03,791 --> 01:08:07,791
Instead we thought about pranking him.

821
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:12,875
But we need you.
- I'm here. What do I have to do?

822
01:08:12,958 --> 01:08:16,541
With a wig that we will give you,
wait at the gym, in the dark.

823
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:19,000
He'll think that it's Simona.

824
01:08:19,083 --> 01:08:20,958
You'll throw your arms around his neck

825
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:24,500
and you'll hide your face,
so nobody will know it's you.

826
01:08:24,583 --> 01:08:29,291
Then we'll take some photos
and we'll send it to everyone at school.

827
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:30,625
So everyone will see

828
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:33,458
that the famous ladies' man likes
transvestites.

829
01:08:34,583 --> 01:08:37,666
- What do you say?
- I can't wait. When will we do it?

830
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:41,750
- Cry, cry.
- This wretched faggot!

831
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:46,875
You don't need to cry,
I don't have that expensive dress anymore.

832
01:08:46,958 --> 01:08:50,083
- Who got it?
- Who got it?

833
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:54,208
- It's not here.
- After all these years of service!

834
01:08:54,291 --> 01:08:59,083
- I didn't touch it!
- You stole the model.

835
01:08:59,166 --> 01:09:03,833
Me? Don't insult me, I'll tell the lady.

836
01:09:03,916 --> 01:09:08,000
I don't give a shit!
Tell everyone, I'm the owner!

837
01:09:08,083 --> 01:09:12,166
You know what? You're fired!

838
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:15,000
- Try to say it one more time.
- I fire you!

839
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:23,416
What should a weak lady do?

840
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,333
First you smack me then you cry?

841
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:33,583
- Eat something, it's good for you.
- I'm not hungry, leave me alone.

842
01:09:33,666 --> 01:09:36,083
You're not feeling well?

843
01:09:36,166 --> 01:09:41,833
Simona, now that we prepared everything,
you're backing out?

844
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:44,166
I don't feel like it today.

845
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:49,416
- You only have to make a phone call.
- I'll dial the number.

846
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:53,916
Are you aware you're not looking at me
for a while now?

847
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:57,000
I'll look at you only if you go away.

848
01:10:06,541 --> 01:10:10,083
- Hello?
<i>- Why didn't you go to school?</i>

849
01:10:10,166 --> 01:10:12,375
<i>- How are you?</i>
- I'm not good, I hope I die.

850
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:16,291
Mario, I need to talk to you.
Can I see you tonight?

851
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:21,500
I don't have anything to say.
Stupid, false, jerk and also a whore!

852
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:22,916
- Did you call me?
- No.

853
01:10:23,666 --> 01:10:25,416
Tell him about tonight.

854
01:10:27,333 --> 01:10:31,666
Okay. Since you are presumptuous
and you don't understand,

855
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:36,416
I'll wait for you at the gym
so we can solve everything.

856
01:10:37,208 --> 01:10:39,791
Good, tonight we'll clear everything.

857
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:44,958
- I have never done this.
- Who will recognize you?

858
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:47,416
When you'll hug Mario,
you have to do like this.

859
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,666
- I'm not Mario!
- And I'm not gay. I won't do it.

860
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:54,083
- Come on, Salvatore.
- Okay, let's go.

861
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:56,166
Damn it!

862
01:10:59,166 --> 01:11:03,250
So, what do you say about these kids,
Cacioppo?

863
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:05,583
They're good.

864
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:08,916
- Good. Do they keep up with science?
- Yes.

865
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,416
- Good.
- Good evening.

866
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,583
- That Ridolini kid, how's it going?
- He's quick.

867
01:11:14,666 --> 01:11:17,500
- We have to inform the parents.
- Yes.

868
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:21,833
- I'll hop to the gym for a bit.
- Hop? At this hour?

869
01:11:21,916 --> 01:11:24,000
I forgot the tracksuit.

870
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:27,500
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

871
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:29,666
The tracksuit? At this hour?

872
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:34,458
Who is it?

873
01:11:39,083 --> 01:11:43,458
What a show! And in front of the kids!

874
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:51,291
- When will you become a man?
- Don't leave me. Don't leave me.

875
01:11:51,375 --> 01:11:53,291
It's Sodom and Gomorrah?

876
01:11:56,250 --> 01:12:00,416
Mrs. Ileana, if you only knew
what your husband has done to me!

877
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,000
- What?
- You can't imagine!

878
01:12:03,083 --> 01:12:07,333
In half an hour I must be at the office.
We'll talk about it later.

879
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:10,750
- Don't worry.
- He's a delinquent!

880
01:12:10,833 --> 01:12:14,916
But he'll pay dear for it
because he can't do this.

881
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,083
Not to me, madam!

882
01:12:26,916 --> 01:12:29,083
- What are you doing?
- This was stolen.

883
01:12:29,166 --> 01:12:32,375
- You're crazy!
- It's an exclusive Cardin model.

884
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:35,250
- Don't talk bullshit.
- Where did you buy it?

885
01:12:35,333 --> 01:12:37,166
- They gave it to me as a gift.
- Who?

886
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:40,416
- It's my business!
- No, it's my business. Come with me.

887
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:43,375
- Leave me alone.
- Come with me.

888
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:47,500
They want you on the phone.

889
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:50,500
- Who is bothering me?
- Miss Simona.

890
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:52,750
What does she want?

891
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:55,666
Hello? What?

892
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:58,041
At the police station?

893
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,416
What's this story about a stolen dress?

894
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:06,333
- They stole her dress?
- Are they crazy?

895
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:11,583
Did you tell that imbecile
that I could buy you a shopping mall?

896
01:13:11,666 --> 01:13:13,750
Wait, I'm coming right over.

897
01:13:13,833 --> 01:13:17,166
They're accusing her of stealing a dress.

898
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:19,500
- Take out the car.
- I'm coming with you.

899
01:13:19,583 --> 01:13:23,916
- It's better if you get dressed.
- Of course.

900
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,916
Call the lawyer and tell him
to meet me at the police station.

901
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,166
It's absurd that they're blaming our girl.

902
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:36,708
With all that's been happening in Italy,
they lost their minds.

903
01:13:38,333 --> 01:13:43,833
Sir, we can't do it anymore.
Robberies, kidnappings, car thefts...

904
01:13:43,916 --> 01:13:47,666
You can't imagine
how much work we have to do.

905
01:13:48,916 --> 01:13:52,041
At least try to collaborate.

906
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:54,916
The charge is precise.

907
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,333
If you refuse to talk,
you just confirm the accusation.

908
01:13:58,416 --> 01:14:03,875
Tell me who gave you the dress
and you'll be free.

909
01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:05,916
Tell him.

910
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,791
No, I'll talk only when my lawyer is here.

911
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:14,791
- You see how irritating she is?
- I blame the movies.

912
01:14:15,833 --> 01:14:17,583
- Can I enter?
- You're already in.

913
01:14:19,666 --> 01:14:23,958
Are you fasting? Me and you have to talk.

914
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:27,583
I'm a good person, but you know
what happens when I get upset.

915
01:14:27,666 --> 01:14:29,333
You have to eat.

916
01:14:29,416 --> 01:14:34,000
I found out
that you and our maid Domenica fuck.

917
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:39,791
I was 20 too
and I understand these things.

918
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:43,958
But you need your vitamins
exactly for this reason.

919
01:14:44,041 --> 01:14:49,666
Don't eat some salad and pasta,
but a sandwich with some meat inside.

920
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:52,791
Do I have to do the plane,
like when you were little?

921
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:54,916
It's good for you, look here.

922
01:14:56,083 --> 01:14:57,416
It's also good.

923
01:14:59,666 --> 01:15:01,791
Perfect, look.

924
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:04,833
- Who is it?
- Hello?

925
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,041
- Yes. Dad, it's the police.
- The police?

926
01:15:15,083 --> 01:15:16,708
Hello?

927
01:15:16,791 --> 01:15:20,833
Hello? Yes, it's me, D'Olivo.

928
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:22,958
Yes, officer. Tell me.

929
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:25,666
Did they find the thief?

930
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:28,916
Okay, right away.

931
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,750
Sorry, I'm constipated
with a sandwich and a cold.

932
01:15:32,833 --> 01:15:34,500
See you later.

933
01:15:34,583 --> 01:15:36,958
- They found the dress.
- Yes?

934
01:15:37,041 --> 01:15:40,416
A girl had it.
Now I have to go to the police station.

935
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:43,833
If someone calls me...
Never mind. Domenica!

936
01:15:43,916 --> 01:15:48,750
If someone phones me,
tell them to call me back on Monday.

937
01:15:48,833 --> 01:15:53,916
- What a week!
- Did you see how lucky!

938
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
What are you doing?
Bring me a shirt, I'm in a hurry.

939
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:06,416
Things from another world!
Tell me, Mr. Officer,

940
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:14,208
A man of my economic and industrial power,

941
01:16:14,291 --> 01:16:17,583
a man that came from the North
to build an industry here...

942
01:16:18,833 --> 01:16:21,000
that feeds 200 families...

943
01:16:21,916 --> 01:16:25,750
- I make eight million...
- Of bayonets?

944
01:16:25,833 --> 01:16:27,958
Of sausages a year.

945
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:32,916
I wouldn't buy a dress for my baby girl?

946
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,500
I'd get her a golden dress!

947
01:16:35,583 --> 01:16:40,041
- Yes but let's sit, I have an headache.
- You're right.

948
01:16:40,125 --> 01:16:42,583
But you still didn't answer.

949
01:16:42,666 --> 01:16:46,250
Madam, we can't discuss this.

950
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:50,208
Your girl told me
that the dress was a present.

951
01:16:50,291 --> 01:16:54,000
- I would like to know from who.
- I would like to know it too.

952
01:16:54,083 --> 01:16:57,416
- What is it?
- Mr. D'Olivo is here.

953
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:02,125
- Let him in.
- Only I can say it. Let him in!

954
01:17:02,916 --> 01:17:06,333
- Good morning.
- He said that I stole the dress.

955
01:17:06,416 --> 01:17:11,416
Don't you dare blame
a poor, weak and defenseless woman!

956
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:15,625
- Sit down!
- I'm gonna lose my mind.

957
01:17:15,708 --> 01:17:19,375
Officer, I want to know
who stole the dress.

958
01:17:19,458 --> 01:17:25,000
I'm good and all, but if I get upset,
I can break their bones!

959
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:26,750
- You are Mr. D'Olivo?
- Yes.

960
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:28,916
- Officer Athorse.
- At horse?

961
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,500
- What's so funny?
- Officers go on horses.

962
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:33,083
You go on horses?

963
01:17:33,166 --> 01:17:36,833
- My father is Athorse and I'm Athorse too.
- Your mom goes by foot?

964
01:17:36,916 --> 01:17:40,541
- Let's not talk about horses.
- These hillbillies...

965
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:43,500
- You don't like it? It's good.
- Let's talk about this dress.

966
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:48,041
I could buy thousands
and thousands of these rags!

967
01:17:48,125 --> 01:17:51,750
- Who is that man?
- He's the father of the girl.

968
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:54,833
- And who's the girl?
- She's the daughter of sausage man.

969
01:17:54,916 --> 01:17:57,166
- Of course.
- Come in.

970
01:17:57,250 --> 01:18:00,833
- Come in.
- There's the defendant's lawyer.

971
01:18:00,916 --> 01:18:03,666
- What defendant?
- Silence. Let him pass.

972
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:06,166
- Come in.
- Good morning.

973
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:09,375
- You took too much time to come!
- Teo!

974
01:18:11,083 --> 01:18:14,833
- What are you doing here?
- And what are you doing here?

975
01:18:14,916 --> 01:18:18,375
- You know each other?
- That man is my husband.

976
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:23,125
- So she's my wife.
- You are here for the accusation.

977
01:18:23,208 --> 01:18:26,333
I work for the defendant.

978
01:18:26,416 --> 01:18:29,916
Of course she defends someone
who comes against me!

979
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,166
- She's going against her husband!
- I don't understand anything.

980
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:37,083
- Sorry.
- Please, tell me what you want.

981
01:18:37,166 --> 01:18:38,250
Come in.

982
01:18:39,583 --> 01:18:44,000
- There's a kid, it's urgent.
- Don't you see that I'm busy?

983
01:18:44,083 --> 01:18:46,875
- It's about the case.
- Let him in.

984
01:18:46,958 --> 01:18:48,666
Come in.

985
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:53,791
Sorry, Dad.

986
01:18:55,041 --> 01:18:57,083
Sorry, Mom. Sorry, Simona.

987
01:18:57,166 --> 01:19:00,041
Look, the communist!

988
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:04,333
Officer, I'm the thief.

989
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:10,375
Colleagues, dear boys and girls,

990
01:19:10,458 --> 01:19:15,250
it's with immense pleasure
that today we're celebrating

991
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:20,500
the 15th year
that Prof. Cacioppo teaches here.

992
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:23,958
- Hurray!
- Congratulations!

993
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:28,916
A good man, a perfect teacher,

994
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,541
an example for everyone,

995
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:38,333
despite some episodes
of youthful exuberance, am I right?

996
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:43,208
A man that with his honesty,
his intelligence, and his seriousness,

997
01:19:43,291 --> 01:19:46,750
and I'm sure
that I'm not saying something wrong,

998
01:19:46,833 --> 01:19:51,250
would bring joy to every woman.

999
01:19:51,333 --> 01:19:53,333
Did you hear what he said, Professor?

1000
01:19:57,041 --> 01:20:00,250
This man is always first to arrive...

1001
01:20:00,333 --> 01:20:04,750
I was supposed to be there instead of him?
You wanted to prank me.

1002
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:07,000
Instead you pranked me.

1003
01:20:07,083 --> 01:20:11,000
- What prank?
- You made me fall in love.

1004
01:20:22,416 --> 01:20:25,625
And I hope

1005
01:20:25,708 --> 01:20:29,166
that he will not only teach
for another 15 years

1006
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:32,250
but for another 150 years!

1007
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:36,416
I wish everyone happiness. I'm done!

1008
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:39,958
- Good job!
- Should we make a toast?

1009
01:20:40,041 --> 01:20:41,708
Of course.

1010
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:55,125
Cheers!

1011
01:20:56,708 --> 01:21:00,958
It doesn't matter, it's good luck!
Let's dance!

1012
01:21:01,041 --> 01:21:04,916
You'll be mine all night long,
don't run away!

1013
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
No.

1014
01:21:26,666 --> 01:21:29,916
- It's good, right?
- You go dance with her.

1015
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,125
- I can't do it anymore.
- Let's do the tango.

1016
01:21:33,208 --> 01:21:34,375
Have fun!

1017
01:21:50,416 --> 01:21:55,416
We're lucky to have nice weather.

1018
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:58,000
It was always sunny.

1019
01:21:58,083 --> 01:22:01,750
- But it could rain...
- I don't understand.

1020
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:06,125
- You checked the weather report?
- No, I feel it my bones.

1021
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:11,958
- They have nothing to do with it.
- But sometimes...

1022
01:22:12,041 --> 01:22:16,291
No, I can assure you
that here it won't rain.

1023
01:22:16,375 --> 01:22:18,666
Let's hope so.

1024
01:22:20,583 --> 01:22:22,833
Damn it!

1025
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:26,333
The cake!

1026
01:22:28,666 --> 01:22:32,375
Speech! Speech!

1027
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:35,833
Speech! Speech! Speech!

1028
01:22:35,916 --> 01:22:39,000
- Speech! Speech!
- Okay, it's a pleasure.

1029
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:44,083
Thanks to everyone and let's have a toast!

1030
01:22:44,166 --> 01:22:45,916
Cheers!

1031
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,291
It doesn't matter, it's good luck! Cheers!

1032
01:22:50,375 --> 01:22:53,666
Cheers! We can never drink here!

1033
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:58,583
<i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

1034
01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:04,125
Mom!
