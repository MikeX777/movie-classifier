1
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,687
C'mon, c'mon, fast.

2
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,365
Let me see your stuff.

3
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,270
Here's the money.
Zolo will be pleased.

4
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:26,995
I'm sure he will.

5
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,436
Stop!

6
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,702
Halt!

7
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,739
Hold it!

8
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:59,195
Get back!

9
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,572
He got shot.

10
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:30,226
I'm so sorry, Inspector Kumar.
So sorry.

11
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,025
See this gets locked
in Drugs and Narcotics

12
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,461
- Good afternoon, Sylvia.
- Hello.

13
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:14,934
Now, where did I...?

14
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,310
- The plane tickets? Sam!
- Of course.

15
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:23,107
And the agency
recommended a nanny...

16
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,547
Yes, her name's Amba and she'll
be waiting for you at the hotel.

17
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:30,052
And there'll be a car at the airport
just near the baggage claim...

18
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,816
you know, with one of them signs,
"Dr. Richard Avery."

19
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:37,086
- Come on, Sammy, your snack's ready.
- Amba's a nice name.

20
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,494
- Hey, Dad!
- Hey, buddy. How was school?

21
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,928
- Good.
- Really good?

22
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,296
- Really good.
- Come on.

23
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:48,565
Eat all this supper and I don't
want any milk left, all right?

24
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:52,142
So, Sam, are you excited
about Christmas in India?

25
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,675
I've got Sam's bags all packed, so
you won't have to worry about that.

26
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:01,786
I guess that's everything, isn't it?
What would I do without you, Sylvia?

27
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:06,049
I really don't know. But I am glad
you've decided to take him with you.

28
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,819
He needs some time with you.

29
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,587
I'm glad, too.

30
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,195
Mommy?

31
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,241
Sam?

32
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,712
- Sam, wake up.
- Mommy?

33
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,475
You just had a nightmare.

34
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,277
You okay?

35
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,819
You sure?

36
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:50,560
- Are you looking for anything?
- A grizzler.

37
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,637
Is that like a bear?

38
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,867
You're not gonna find any up here.
Bears hate to walk upstairs.

39
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:02,173
- Are you sure?
- Trust me, I know my grizzlers.

40
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,942
Let's get you back to sleep.
We've got a long flight tomorrow.

41
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:11,185
Here, put Charlie in charge. You
won't have more nightmares tonight.

42
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,823
Good night.

43
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,758
- You ready?
- Not all the way, please.

44
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,140
How's that?

45
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,370
Well.

46
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,474
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night.

47
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:49,887
<i>Thank you for choosing Flight 114</i>
<i>to Bangkok</i>, <i>and on to New Delhi</i>.

48
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,628
Dad?

49
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,400
What happens if the plane
can't get off the ground?

50
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:59,404
Then we get our money back.

51
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,906
Here we go.

52
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,465
Dad?

53
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,971
Is that what it looks
like when you die?

54
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,205
Like you said, with Mom.

55
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:46,312
No, Sam.
No, it's much different.

56
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,129
That way.

57
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,002
- Doctor?
- No, I'm not Dr. Yevchenko.

58
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,640
- You go to the medical conference?
- Your bags...

59
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,707
I'm not the doctor on your sign.

60
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,810
I'm looking for my driver.
I'm Dr. Richard Avery.

61
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:50,176
- I'm driver.
- No, I understand that, but...

62
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:54,080
- Do you speak English?
- Yes, I speak.

63
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,682
All right, terrific.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

64
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,595
- Everything looks so old.
- It is old.

65
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,494
Some of these buildings
are as old as me.

66
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,190
No way!

67
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,444
Good morning, sir.

68
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:35,447
- Cool.
- Come on, let's see what's inside.

69
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,392
- Nice!
- Yeah, very nice.

70
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,826
- How may I help you, sir?
- I'm Dr. Richard Avery...

71
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:49,125
...I believe I have a reservation.
- We've been expecting you, sir.

72
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:50,859
- Great.
- Did you have a pleasant journey?

73
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,330
Yes, pleasant but, uh, long.

74
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,538
Yes, sir, it's quite a distance.
I hope now that you're here...

75
00:12:56,742 --> 00:13:00,109
you'll be able to relax and enjoy
a very pleasant stay with us.

76
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,611
I don't suppose a woman by the name
of Amba has been looking for me?

77
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:07,912
- She's a nanny from the agency.
- I'm sorry, sir, not that I know of.

78
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,552
May I see your passport
and a credit card, please?

79
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,659
Yes, I understand that but...

80
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,763
I don't feel comfortable leaving Sam
with someone I've never met...

81
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:26,096
or seen references for.
All right.

82
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,430
8 a.m. in the lobby,
with references.

83
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,800
- Okay, thanks.
- Sylvia didn't forget.

84
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,405
Sylvia never forgets.

85
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,677
Dad, we don't need a nanny.

86
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:43,054
We can talk about later.
Come on, let's get you to bed.

87
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:46,448
- But I'm not tired.
- But we got a big day tomorrow...

88
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:51,961
and we gotta get an early start.
Besides, it's 8 a.m. back home.

89
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,530
Dad, I'm always awake
at 8 in the morning.

90
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,360
A funny guy, huh?

91
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,635
- Know what happens to funny guys?
- Thank you, you can go now.

92
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,400
You better watch it!

93
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,976
I got you!

94
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,960
Will you excuse me
just for a moment?

95
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,792
Thank you.

96
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:37,802
- Is she all right for you, sir?
- Dunno. There's something about her.

97
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,675
It's just... I don't really feel
good leaving Sam with her.

98
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,943
I understand perfectly, sir.
I send her on her way.

99
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:49,052
Would you like me to try
to find somebody else for you?

100
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,854
I don't know, I don't know.

101
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,929
Ma'am, I think you have to go.
Sorry.

102
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,832
So... can I go with you?

103
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,100
I don't know, Sam.
It's just for adults.

104
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:15,042
- Real boring.
- You're gonna leave me again?

105
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,647
Mommy wouldn't leave me.

106
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,455
I don't get this.

107
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,238
You promise to be good?
Do everything I say?

108
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,570
Put your hands on top of your head.
Cross your heart.

109
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,044
All right.

110
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,949
But you gotta change that shirt.

111
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,492
Pretty amazing, huh?

112
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:32,249
You gotta sit tight and no wandering
around when the lights go down.

113
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,756
It's like a movie.

114
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:38,492
I'm gonna be right up there.
I'm the first speaker.

115
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:42,497
- What are you gonna say?
- Some really big words.

116
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:48,232
- Young man, what did I say?
- I'm not bored, I'm not bored.

117
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,834
You sit tight.
I'll be back real soon.

118
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,060
How do you do, sir?

119
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:17,662
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed
colleagues, fellow doctors...

120
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,662
I'd like to welcome you to the
International Health Organization's...

121
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,332
Third Annual Biomedical Seminar.

122
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,638
And now it's my great
privilege and pleasure...

123
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,475
to introduce Dr. Richard Avery...

124
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:36,882
who has come here all the way from
Hollings Institute in San Diego, US.

125
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,581
Welcome, Dr. Richard Avery.

126
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,698
Thank you.

127
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,062
I am honored to have been asked
to give my opinion here today...

128
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:54,330
even if the topic is inherently
terminal to your livelihoods.

129
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,009
As the 21 st century begins...

130
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:07,450
the medical community find itself on
the verge of a scientific revolution.

131
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,916
While the last century
belonged to pharmaceuticals...

132
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,681
and to the technological gold rush...

133
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,592
the new millennium will be the era
of genetics and bioengineering.

134
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:26,994
Now it's easy to become caught up in
the excitement of this new frontier.

135
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,869
When Celera broke
the human genome code...

136
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:36,445
it was widely accepted that...

137
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:39,811
a wellspring of
medical knowledge...

138
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:45,487
medical knowledge,
understanding...

139
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:49,252
and cures would spring forth.

140
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,026
There is however... a parad...

141
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,063
Excuse me.

142
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,471
I'm sorry. Just a moment, please.

143
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,219
Excuse me, there was
a small boy sitting here...

144
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,557
Sam?

145
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,266
Excuse me.

146
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,630
- Did you see a small boy here...?
- Sorry, sir.

147
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,636
Thank you.

148
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,053
Excuse me, you were sitting close
to my son. Did you see him leave?

149
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,243
Your son?

150
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:53,791
Are these stairs to the bathroom?
Did a small boy go to the bathroom?

151
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,357
You're sure?
Nobody came by here?

152
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,054
- Sam?
- Dr. Avery?

153
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,891
My son has disappeared. He was
sitting here, now I can't find him.

154
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,000
- I'll call security.
- Will you, please? Thank you.

155
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,501
Sam?

156
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,200
Dr. Avery? Perhaps he's just
outside, he couldn't be too far.

157
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,036
Thank you.

158
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,154
- Sir.
- You on security, Steadman?

159
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,258
Excuse me, Dr. Avery.
This is Senior Inspector Kumar.

160
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,261
How do you do, Doctor?

161
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,999
- I'm Julia Hyde.
- You're American.

162
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,658
Yes, I am. I've been assigned here
as part of an anti-terrorist unit.

163
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,399
You think Sam was kidnapped
by terrorists?

164
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,304
Well, we cannot rule that out
at this moment...

165
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,977
but kidnapping for money
is very common in India.

166
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,146
Inspector Kumar works
in the Narcotics Division...

167
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,839
but we've both had previous
experience with situations like this.

168
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,177
So I've asked for his help.

169
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,581
- Where's the kidnapper's note?
- Have you called your wife?

170
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,982
No, I'm a widower.

171
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,116
I'm sorry to hear that.

172
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,953
"I have your child.

173
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,153
Answer your hotel phone tonight
for instructions.

174
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,793
Call the authorities and he dies."

175
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,358
Bullshit.

176
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,594
If they find out you're here,
they'll kill my son.

177
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,241
As a general rule they all say that.
It doesn't mean anything.

178
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,374
I don't care about general rules.

179
00:21:56,948 --> 00:22:00,349
- Listen...
- You found the note under the seat?

180
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:02,242
Security did, yes.

181
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,149
Did anyone sitting here
see who left this?

182
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:09,225
It was dark.
Guess they were all looking at me.

183
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,525
Did you and your son
meet anyone last night...

184
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,632
or was he talking to anybody
that you can recall?

185
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,462
No one who would do
something like this.

186
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,331
You cannot be sure about that,
Doctor.

187
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:27,205
We'll be at your hotel tonight when
he calls, see if we can get a trace.

188
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,741
I can't risk that.

189
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,849
You're letting your emotions get
the better of your judgment, Doctor.

190
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,754
It's your decision,
but you should hear the facts.

191
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,079
Which are?

192
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:44,695
When the police are not involved,
most victims are not returned alive.

193
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:50,233
And if I do decide to go it alone?

194
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,995
It's police policy to respect
the wishes of the parent.

195
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,197
If we were to intervene and something
should happen to your son...

196
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:59,837
well, that's something nobody wants.

197
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,181
You're not making this easy on me.

198
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,250
Unfortunately,
there's nothing easy about this.

199
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,781
Doctor...

200
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:14,422
if I gave you medical advice,
you would say...

201
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:16,821
"leave it to the experts."

202
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,762
I think you should do the same.

203
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,600
It' s your decision.

204
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,362
Wait.

205
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:10,041
One...

206
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,272
two...

207
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,749
<i>You let me down</i>, <i>Doctor</i>.

208
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,793
- What do you mean?
<i>- You have already disobeyed me</i>.

209
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,964
<i>Do not insult my intelligence again</i>.

210
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,300
- That's not my intention.
<i>- You play games</i>, <i>Doctor</i>.

211
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:36,132
- Games?
<i>- This one is called "Guess."</i>

212
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:39,310
<i>Your room is full of wires</i>
<i>running across the floor</i>...

213
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,604
<i>and a police man is listening</i>
<i>to our conversation</i>...

214
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,247
<i>smoking a cigarette</i>.
<i>Am I correct?</i>

215
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:47,317
<i>Keep in mind if you lie to me</i>,
<i>I will kill your son</i>.

216
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,782
<i>So tell me</i>, <i>Doctor</i>, <i>am I correct?</i>

217
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:07,066
- Yes, you're correct.
<i>- Very good</i>.

218
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:13,037
I made a mistake.
Just tell me what you want.

219
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:17,045
<i>No more police. I'll call again</i>
<i>later when we are alone</i>.

220
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:21,345
<i>If I even think you are talking</i>
<i>to the police</i>, <i>it's over</i>.

221
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,980
When? When will you call?

222
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:28,057
<i>That's my decision</i>.
<i>You just need to be ready</i>.

223
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,026
- I don't want to wait.
<i>- You've been given a second chance</i>.

224
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,323
<i>There will not be a third</i>.

225
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,901
- I understand.
<i>- One more thing:</i>

226
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:40,731
<i>The policeman just stamped out</i>
<i>his cigarette</i>.

227
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,304
He wasn't bluffing.

228
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:55,280
- Did you get a trace?
- Not enough time.

229
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,118
What do you mean, not enough time?
All this time!

230
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:01,482
And did anyone check to see
that no one saw us come in?

231
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:04,929
Okay, let's just settle down.

232
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:09,096
- Next time I want you to work from...
- No. You had your shot.

233
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,292
- I just need to keep...
- Forget it, okay?

234
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,801
This is my son's life.
I'm not gonna risk it.

235
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,530
Big mistake. Trust me.

236
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:22,643
I did trust you. You can leave.

237
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,338
Listen, Doctor, this...

238
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,584
Come on, let's pack our things
and leave. Come on.

239
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,427
Here's my card if you need us.

240
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,070
Come on, come on.

241
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,619
Sleeping well?

242
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:14,361
Where's my son?

243
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:20,268
He's asleep now.
He asked me to tell you hi.

244
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,571
How do I know he's all right?

245
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:33,676
<i>- Can you read this?</i>
<i>- Read what?</i>

246
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,352
<i>This. Can you read it?</i>

247
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,578
<i>"An e</i>...<i>"</i>

248
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,450
<i>"An eye</i>...<i>"</i>

249
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,956
<i>"For an e</i>...<i>"</i>

250
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,149
<i>"An eye</i>...<i>"</i>

251
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,454
<i>"In the battle a</i>...

252
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,929
<i>against the terror."</i>

253
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,568
<i>Very good</i>.

254
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,274
He's a smart boy.

255
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,271
What do you want?
I have money. I can do...

256
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:07,576
No. We will discuss that later.

257
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:12,718
- What is this?
- A beeper.

258
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,149
That is your son's lifeline.

259
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,556
Do what it says and
he will come to no harm.

260
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,197
I am good with the blade.

261
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,996
I have no interest
in killing a small boy...

262
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,500
but I will do what is necessary.

263
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,506
If you harm my son in any way,
I swear to God...

264
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,910
You will what?
Hunt me down and kill me?

265
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:43,480
You will not. You don't know
who I am and you never will.

266
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:47,716
You think you can keep searching,
but this is India, Doctor.

267
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:51,089
One child's life, more or less,
is nothing.

268
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:54,190
You will grieve and that is all.

269
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:01,133
Tomorrow, I will send instructions.
Follow them.

270
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,941
I will. I promise.

271
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:16,916
I hope you do for the sake
of your son.

272
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,318
This is the place, sir.

273
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:28,959
Wait here.

274
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:44,294
English?

275
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,299
English?

276
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,232
Good book.

277
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,806
This, good book.

278
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,050
Good book.

279
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:17,399
Here. No, thank you. Thank you.

280
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,975
- Sir?
- Rings?

281
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,713
Yes, this?

282
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,058
Sorry, sorry.

283
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,066
I gotta get that...

284
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,110
I'm a doctor.

285
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,441
I'll pay for it.

286
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:08,947
Take it all. I gotta go.

287
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,962
You want the jacket?

288
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:20,864
- I'm a doctor. It's an emergency!
- Money!

289
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:23,099
Don't hang up!

290
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:27,635
<i>This was a test. Next time you will</i>
<i>be instructed to bring the money</i>.

291
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,364
<i>Pity about your jacket</i>.
<i>It suited you</i>.

292
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:34,238
<i>- No use looking for me now</i>.
- Where's my son?

293
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:38,108
<i>- He's not with me</i>, <i>but he is fine</i>.
- What have you done? Where is he?

294
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,806
<i>I'll call you tomorrow</i>.

295
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,452
No, not tomorrow.
Let's do this now.

296
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:46,054
<i>Tomorrow night</i>.
<i>You will be contacted at midnight</i>.

297
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:49,693
<i>Do as you did today and you will</i>
<i>have your son by midnight</i>.

298
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:51,862
No, no...

299
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,465
The beeper.

300
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,303
My God!

301
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,522
Excuse me.

302
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,357
That's mine.

303
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,425
Please.

304
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:06,501
I have nothing. I have...
I'm sorry.

305
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,433
Money? No?

306
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,073
Money?

307
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,809
Please. I've lost...
I've lost my son.

308
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,939
Please.

309
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,783
I've lost my son.

310
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,551
Please.

311
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:31,389
Please.

312
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:19,409
<i>The train station is about</i>
<i>45 minutes from here by taxi</i>.

313
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:24,214
These other numbers...
I really don't know, sir.

314
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:30,584
- I wish I could be of more help.
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.

315
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,862
There's the taxi. Right on time.

316
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:53,803
What the hell's the doctor
doing here?

317
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,911
I thought Kumar said
Johnny's going to pick up the bag.

318
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,946
Quick, inform
the station of the trade.

319
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,903
45...

320
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,678
45...

321
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,127
Is this for me?

322
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,602
Money.

323
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:41,904
No one told me to bring any money.

324
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,649
I never got a message
about any money.

325
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,818
Zolo.

326
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,684
Yes, Zolo. Right.

327
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,624
Is this for me?

328
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,688
He's got the bag with the goods.

329
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:32,373
And guess who comes out of the taxi?
This American doctor.

330
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:34,483
The one whose son was kidnapped.

331
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:37,279
And five minutes,
he comes out with the bag...

332
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:40,218
- Full of opium.
- You've got that, man.

333
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:42,558
Good morning, ma'am.

334
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,923
Kumar?

335
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:52,432
- What do you want?
- You ordered surveillance of Avery?

336
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:55,696
- That's none of your business.
- It is, and I want an answer.

337
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,373
Hyde, just leave it alone.

338
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,703
Do you realize you're putting
that child's life in danger?

339
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,401
I've been on this force
for 18 years...

340
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:05,946
- Then you should know better!
- You wanna tell me how to work?

341
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,311
No, you're up to something
and I'm going to figure it out!

342
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,419
Don't fuck with me!

343
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:14,679
Kumar, Miss Hyde,
I want to see you both in my office.

344
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,164
- What's the problem?
- This city woman...

345
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,166
- Excuse me?
- Kumar!

346
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:31,808
This Hyde woman is not only
interfering in my case...

347
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:34,944
she's also coming and
questioning me about my work?

348
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:38,546
He's tailing the American doctor,
which happens to be my case.

349
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:40,774
The doctor asked us not to interfere.

350
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:43,146
Yes, he did.
And if the kidnapper sees us now...

351
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:45,879
We have evidence that
he may be dealing in drugs.

352
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,352
What evidence?

353
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:49,685
He was seen picking up
3 kilograms of opium.

354
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,428
- Whose opium?
- It was a bait.

355
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:56,294
Sir, it was a bait for Zolo
and the American doctor took it.

356
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,402
- Okay, assuming it's true...
- It is! We have photos to prove it.

357
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:04,062
There must be some explanation.
Maybe the kidnapper's using him.

358
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:08,301
- Avery is no trafficker.
- Whatever! I can't take that chance.

359
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:09,636
Why is that?

360
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,907
Sir, Zolo and the doctor
are both Americans.

361
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:17,616
We all know it. Many parents stage
kidnappings for their personal gains.

362
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,847
This is Avery's first time in India.
He's a respected doctor...

363
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:24,152
he has no prior record,
it just doesn't make sense.

364
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:27,696
I've been working on Zolo's case
for a very long time...

365
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:29,525
I cannot let this go now.

366
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:33,362
I request you, sir,
we must continue the surveillance.

367
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:39,506
I'm sorry, Miss Hyde.

368
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,508
Kumar, you may carry on.
But be careful.

369
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:45,779
I don't want the kidnapper
and the doctor to know.

370
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:47,109
Thank you, sir.

371
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:48,812
All right.

372
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:55,722
- It must be her time of the month.
- Kumar!

373
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:58,458
Sorry, sir.

374
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:17,975
Can I come in?

375
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:20,380
I asked you not to come here.

376
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,519
No, you asked me
to stay off the case.

377
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:30,549
- Why are you here?
- Because it's still my case...

378
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:34,356
and because I don't want to see
anything bad happen to you or Sam.

379
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,833
And if you try and do this alone,
chances are something will.

380
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:41,597
I'm sorry, Julia,
I've made my decision.

381
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:48,174
Look, the police do things differently
here, and it's not always...

382
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:52,009
I understand.
Does that include Inspector Kumar?

383
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:57,511
I'll respect your decision.
But you'll at least need someone...

384
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:01,817
to talk to, someone who has more
experience in things like this.

385
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,234
It's my personal number.

386
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:19,133
You can call me anytime.

387
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:26,606
Is Sam your only child?

388
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:28,881
You have kids?

389
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:36,250
- They really do change your life.
- Yeah, that's what I hear.

390
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:41,593
Maybe I just haven't met
the right guy.

391
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:47,133
Well, that's what my mom says
anyway. I work a lot.

392
00:46:47,337 --> 00:46:51,899
I understand.
When we had Sam, I said...

393
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,771
well, maybe this will make me
a better person.

394
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,502
Has it?

395
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,545
No. Not really.

396
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:06,046
But I was hoping this trip
would make me a better father.

397
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,619
Well, maybe it has.

398
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:16,497
I'm gonna get Sam back.

399
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,531
You need to get that.

400
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:29,644
It's probably someone from the
conference to check on things.

401
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,443
I'm sorry.

402
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,249
Be careful.

403
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:40,650
I will.

404
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,792
Julia, thanks.

405
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:58,499
There's a club called Y.I.A.
It belongs to a man called Zolo.

406
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,441
- What kind of club?
- I believe it's a disco, sir.

407
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:06,548
The true name is
Youth In Asia - Y.I.A.

408
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,480
- How do I get there?
- I'll get you a taxi, sir.

409
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:17,817
But be careful. Some of the crowd
out there is not the most desirable.

410
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,522
All right.

411
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,646
- What can I do for you?
- Gin and tonic.

412
00:48:51,228 --> 00:48:53,492
Buy you guys a drink?

413
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:57,732
I'll take that as a no.

414
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:04,640
Maybe you can help me out?
I'm looking for someone.

415
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:08,042
And what makes you think
that we can help you?

416
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,876
- I got something he wants.
- Who? Who do you mean, man?

417
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,078
- Zolo.
- Zolo?

418
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:19,383
- Who is he?
- Who's Zolo?

419
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:25,057
Zolo who, man?
Who's Zolo?

420
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:26,854
He's gonna be really mad
if you guys don't help me out.

421
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:30,500
- Now you are making me mad.
- Don't make us mad, all right?

422
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:32,635
- Now you are making me crazy.
- I've got his beeper.

423
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:39,808
- Where'd you get this?
- You Zolo?

424
00:49:40,544 --> 00:49:44,241
- How did you get that?
- I'm only talking to Zolo.

425
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:46,609
Are you stupid?

426
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:50,683
I got something he wants and I think
you know what I'm talking about.

427
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:53,253
No. Why don't you tell me?

428
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:58,120
I got his goddamn opium,
for Christ sakes. He paged me.

429
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,287
Come with me. Come.

430
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,756
- You have something for me.
- Yes. Let me explain.

431
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:29,721
- Bring it to me.
- I will. My son...

432
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:33,692
- Bring it to me. Now.
- Can I explain the circumstances?

433
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,627
This is very simple.

434
00:50:37,834 --> 00:50:42,066
Do you have my merchandise?

435
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:47,572
- Then bring it to me. That's it.
- That's not it.

436
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,115
You want to barter... with me?

437
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:59,649
- No, I just want my beeper back.
- Your what?

438
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:05,419
My beeper. Whoever you
were paging has my beeper.

439
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:09,061
I need it back. It's important.

440
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,162
It must be.

441
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:14,697
It must be very important.

442
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:18,497
And you're right.

443
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:22,405
You have no choice.
I'm not negotiating over a beeper.

444
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:24,974
Get another one.

445
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:30,510
If I don't get it back,
I might as well be dead.

446
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:05,851
All right. What's so important?

447
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:19,595
You had no business
seeing that doctor today.

448
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:23,204
- I don't work for you.
- You work for the department.

449
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:26,702
Don't worry, I didn't tell him
you were following him.

450
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:31,103
So you stopped by for some chai?
Or something else?

451
00:52:32,015 --> 00:52:36,281
- The man's son is missing.
- My drugs are missing! He has them.

452
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,985
And you know that very well.
Maybe too damn well.

453
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:45,155
If you have something to say, say
it. Otherwise, I have work to do.

454
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:50,356
Yes, I have something to say.
Next time you want to play doctor...

455
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,959
just call me.

456
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:20,160
Now that's some story.

457
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:24,328
I just have to get that beeper
back by midnight...

458
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,796
which gives me less than 5 hours.

459
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:31,702
- We're talking about half a million.
- We're talking about my son.

460
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:37,608
- I can't afford to care.
- You better care about my son.

461
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:53,594
Look, let's get one thing straight:

462
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,765
Blackmailing me isn't the
smartest move you can make.

463
00:53:57,334 --> 00:54:01,202
- I don't have many moves left.
- All right.

464
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:04,905
Tell you what, bring me the bag
and I'll see what I can do...

465
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,140
I can't do that.

466
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:11,678
I don't see that you have
many options left.

467
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,319
Half a million ought to buy me
at least a couple of options.

468
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:33,200
What do you suggest?

469
00:54:36,006 --> 00:54:38,907
You and I go get the beeper
from that guy...

470
00:54:40,076 --> 00:54:42,101
then we get the bag.

471
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,812
Sound fair?

472
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:56,153
You have balls, Doc. That's
the only reason you're still alive.

473
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,521
Okay, let's go.

474
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:48,175
No one knows where Johnny is?

475
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,513
I know you wouldn't hold out
on me, right?

476
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:07,355
One more stop.

477
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:17,937
- Hello, Miss Hyde. You still here?
- Yes, I am. What's your excuse?

478
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:21,633
- I have to finish up this paperwork.
- You guys are big on it.

479
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:26,407
Amazes me so many forms and
signatures. Are those the Zolo files?

480
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:29,813
- Yes, they are a mess.
- I can see that.

481
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,186
And with the opium it's even worse.
10 pieces of paper and 6 signatures.

482
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,484
And if you miss anything,
you've had it.

483
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:41,289
- Is there paperwork missing or drugs?
- Well, it's a mess, a big mess.

484
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,531
I'm sure if anyone can sort it out,
it's you, Ganesh. Goodnight.

485
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:48,033
Thank you, ma'am. Goodnight.

486
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:06,015
- Sir.
- What did Miss Hyde want?

487
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:07,746
Nothing, sir.

488
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:10,883
Nothing?

489
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,826
- What was she looking at?
- Zolo case files, sir.

490
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:40,319
- What's this place?
- A place you'd never come.

491
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:51,723
Wait here.
Unless you see something you like.

492
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,960
Very funny.

493
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:11,446
- I'm here with Zolo.
- I'm here, too. Wanna play with me?

494
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:16,324
- No, thank you very much.
- Are you from America?

495
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:20,223
- She coming with you?
- What's your...?

496
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:30,704
- What was that all about?
- Now I'm angry.

497
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:35,570
Something's not right. Johnny has
just disappeared. No one's seen him.

498
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:40,146
- This whole thing has a bad taste.
- Maybe it's your opium backing up.

499
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:44,882
You joking?

500
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:49,214
I don't do opium. It's addictive.
You're a doctor, you should know that.

501
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:54,223
I can't believe I'll give it to you.
Not after seeing who you sell it to.

502
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:57,456
Save the morality lesson.
I get enough from my mother.

503
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:02,271
- That girl was just a teenager.
- Not anymore.

504
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:08,671
You think you're better than me?

505
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:14,282
We all deal something doctor,
some lie or injustice, some vice...

506
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:16,714
to get what we want.

507
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,821
Trying to save your son
with a bag of opium.

508
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:23,959
We all got our reasons.

509
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:16,273
So where is he?

510
01:00:16,479 --> 01:00:18,106
I don't know.

511
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:21,612
- What time is it?
- Almost nine.

512
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:27,616
Look, Doc, I've done all I can.

513
01:00:28,591 --> 01:00:31,719
So, let's get my stuff
and say goodbye.

514
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,930
That is not our agreement.

515
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:40,161
The only agreement we have is
I'll kill you right here, right now...

516
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:42,338
if we don't get my shit this minute.

517
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:46,599
I don't care about the money.
I will not be made a fool of.

518
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:49,208
We still have a couple of hours.

519
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:52,209
Wrong answer.

520
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:55,077
- My son is just...
- Fuck you.

521
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:04,252
Johnny's at home.

522
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,689
It's your night, Doc.

523
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:09,662
You're a lucky man. Get in.

524
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:14,458
Sorry, Miss. Sorry, Madam.

525
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,730
Sorry. Sorry, Madam.
Sorry, Miss.

526
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:40,651
- Johnny's got some place, huh?
- Why didn't we come here before?

527
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:45,189
Because he's never here.
Wiseass.

528
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:48,621
You want a drink?

529
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:52,559
No. Thank you.

530
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:55,433
I do.

531
01:02:57,306 --> 01:03:02,505
Here. We celebrate.
Here's to you still being alive.

532
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,010
Here's to your son.

533
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:11,887
Thanks.

534
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:15,485
You know, seeing you makes me
maybe want to have a son.

535
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:21,453
I think you might be
in the wrong business.

536
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:24,090
You don't think I know that?

537
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,996
You think I do what I do
out of choice?

538
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:29,564
Well, we all make tough choices.

539
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:32,798
If I stopped tomorrow,
I'd be dead by sunset.

540
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:35,907
And I don't want to die,
you understand?

541
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:40,646
Yeah, but living isn't
just about surviving.

542
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:52,021
- Now it's your turn to survive.
- Come here. Hand it over.

543
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:57,763
When you give me my opium.
You'll hear it if it goes off.

544
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:11,704
Good evening, sir.

545
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,793
Jesus.

546
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:35,566
- This is your work, isn't it?
- I do what I gotta do.

547
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:38,262
So, where is it?

548
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:42,744
Son of a bitch.

549
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:45,277
Don't take it personally.

550
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:48,177
Call housekeeping.
They'll clean it up for you.

551
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:54,512
Oh, man. This is beautiful.

552
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,693
Police! Police!

553
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:08,460
Make one move, Mr. Zolo,
and I will be eternally grateful.

554
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:10,662
Bad move.

555
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:15,734
Kumar, what the hell?

556
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:19,039
This guy here invited me up
for a drink.

557
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,682
Salim.

558
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:33,358
Show me. What is inside that wall?

559
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:41,234
You know my son is in trouble.

560
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:43,433
Just bring the drugs out.

561
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:47,237
- Drugs? I had no idea...
- Shut up!

562
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:50,879
Let's go. Show me the drugs.

563
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:56,613
- I want to speak to Julia Hyde.
- Fuck Julia! I'm in charge here!

564
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,080
What the hell is going on here?

565
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:36,349
No booze?

566
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,753
Where's the opium?

567
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,433
Where is the drugs?

568
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,965
- Arrest these men!
- On what charge?

569
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:56,235
- You live in a sheltered world, Doc.
- Move!

570
01:07:04,387 --> 01:07:09,586
We agree you picked up the drugs
from the train station.

571
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,619
And then?

572
01:07:13,095 --> 01:07:18,590
I've told you ten times.
I went to the hotel.

573
01:07:18,834 --> 01:07:25,330
Look, my son will be dead if
I don't get out of here right now!

574
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:29,807
You tell me the truth and
we can both help each other out.

575
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:34,811
I've told you the truth.
You don't want it.

576
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:39,283
Look, let me talk to my consulate
or something.

577
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:45,692
I've got to get out of here!
Dammit!

578
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:49,828
- Where is the opium?
- I don't know!

579
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:52,330
My son's life is at risk,
you bastard!

580
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:55,971
A thousand children's lives are at
risk because of Zolo and his drugs...

581
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:58,970
...and you work for him!
- No, I don't!

582
01:07:59,175 --> 01:08:00,472
- You work for him!
- I don't!

583
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:04,635
- You work for him!
- No, I don't! No, I don't!

584
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:06,838
Kumar!

585
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:11,045
Outside.

586
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:51,888
You can go for now.
And join your other friends.

587
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:25,850
Let's go backwards,
each one of us...

588
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,930
I didn't set you up.

589
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,266
- I didn't set you up.
- No shit. You had me cold.

590
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:38,471
So who saved my ass?

591
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,934
I don't know.

592
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:44,009
Then I don't owe you.

593
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,344
Everybody out.

594
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:52,883
All right, let him go.

595
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:05,258
- I want my beeper.
- I want my goods.

596
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:08,092
It's 11 o'clock for chrissake.

597
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:10,499
Tension's high, isn't it?

598
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:16,571
What the fuck?

599
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:23,282
I'm not fucking around this time.

600
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:34,662
- You even know how to use it?
- I think so.

601
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:37,395
Now empty your pockets.

602
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:42,329
You've been watching
too many movies, Doc.

603
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:50,837
Here. Now get the fuck outta here.

604
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:56,107
It's not the right one.

605
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:59,078
- It's the only one I got.
- I want the one Johnny had!

606
01:10:59,288 --> 01:11:01,688
Johnny's dead!

607
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:05,760
They found him a couple of hours ago
with a bullet in his head.

608
01:11:06,996 --> 01:11:09,157
That's the one Tiger
got from his house.

609
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:11,799
If that's not the one, then
I don't know where the fuck it is!

610
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,200
Why don't you put that gun down?

611
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:29,748
I'm doing what I could for you.
One of my own's dead.

612
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,579
Yours may still have a chance.

613
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:38,025
You fuck, who you think you are?

614
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:43,497
Jerking me all over town
for that shitty little beeper.

615
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,533
That's not Johnny.

616
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:48,927
What?

617
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:51,963
That's Johnny.

618
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:58,102
- The man we've been looking for.
- Not the guy I met in the market.

619
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:08,222
- Then how'd you get his beeper?
- I don't know.

620
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:16,126
I think we're both being
jerked around here.

621
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:19,327
We better do something about it.

622
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,446
Sleeping on the job, are you?

623
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:43,855
- I lost the beeper.
- You're not a responsible parent.

624
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,760
- Figured you'd come for the ransom.
- At least you're a clever man.

625
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:52,694
- Or are you?
- I think so.

626
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:56,299
You have the opium, don't you?

627
01:12:57,506 --> 01:13:01,203
What? No witty comeback?

628
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:06,175
Come on, you've been watching me.

629
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:10,014
You're the only one
who could've seen me hide it.

630
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:13,120
So tell me...

631
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:16,658
...am I correct?
- Sit down.

632
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:19,087
I don't think so.

633
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:21,319
Drop the gun.

634
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:25,197
Drop the gun. Now!

635
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,068
- Now where's my son?
- He will be dead...

636
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:37,274
...if I don't get back in time.
- Who the fuck are you?

637
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,749
Watch the window.

638
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:29,351
Get out of the car.

639
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:16,268
Here. Take it!

640
01:16:16,471 --> 01:16:18,496
Go for the tires.

641
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:29,413
Forget the tires.

642
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:32,917
- Shoot the guy!
- I don't want to kill him.

643
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,528
Get my ass on this guy,
I'm gonna...

644
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:25,592
Let me guess.

645
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:28,421
That's the guy from the market.

646
01:19:38,406 --> 01:19:40,237
Sorry.

647
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,201
Car's gonna blow up.
That's gonna blow. Come on!

648
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:35,353
Thanks for coming.

649
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:38,588
- I need your help.
- Sure. What's going on?

650
01:21:38,793 --> 01:21:41,284
- I think I know who kidnapped Sam.
- What?

651
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:45,193
It's all with the police and
I'm pretty sure Kumar's involved.

652
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,095
Okay, but how?

653
01:21:47,302 --> 01:21:50,794
It's all about the opium.
I think Kumar kidnapped my son...

654
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:53,907
got me to steal the opium,
stole it from me...

655
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:56,543
and now's trying
to collect the ransom.

656
01:21:57,979 --> 01:22:00,243
Do you have any proof?

657
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:05,447
It's the only way
all the pieces fit.

658
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:10,991
- Look, go back to the hotel.
- Julia!

659
01:22:11,192 --> 01:22:14,992
Richard, please.
Let me help you with this.

660
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:19,131
There's some things about Kumar
that haven't set right.

661
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:21,966
I can get Sam back.

662
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:29,742
- All right.
- Go back to the hotel...

663
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:32,436
I will call you
in an hour. I promise.

664
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:42,946
Julia?

665
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:48,055
Thanks.

666
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:07,245
- So?
- So she thinks it's Kumar, too.

667
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:10,111
She wants us to go wait for her
at the hotel.

668
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:18,825
Give me your phone.

669
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:26,091
<i>Sanjay?</i>

670
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:28,792
<i>Sanjay</i>, <i>is that you?</i>

671
01:23:34,576 --> 01:23:36,771
It's Julia.

672
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:41,142
The lady cop? You're shittin' me.

673
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:51,682
He just pulled off, Inspector.
Quite fast. We are in pursuit.

674
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:53,793
- Let's go?
- Let's go.

675
01:24:03,872 --> 01:24:06,136
There she is. Right there.

676
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:45,645
Dad? Where's my dad?

677
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:48,179
- Where's my dad?
- Sam!

678
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:51,375
- I need you to go and sit down.
- But where is he?

679
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:54,612
Sit down. Sit back down.

680
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:10,437
Stay there.

681
01:25:21,983 --> 01:25:27,011
Sam, I need you to be very quiet.
Can you do that?

682
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:41,528
- Dad!
- Drop it!

683
01:25:41,736 --> 01:25:43,397
- Don't!
- Please!

684
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:46,733
- I'm not fucking around!
- Drop it!

685
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:51,469
Don't be an asshole, Zolo!
Drop it! Drop the gun!

686
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,612
- Drop it!
- Please.

687
01:26:00,088 --> 01:26:02,522
Now your car keys.

688
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:10,297
Now I want both of you
to move over there.

689
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:12,193
Move it!

690
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,334
- Richard, move it!
- Just leave Sam.

691
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:17,403
- I'm sorry. I can't do that.
- Julia, please.

692
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:21,468
Do as I say and I'll call you
at the hotel let you know...

693
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:23,541
where you can find me.

694
01:26:24,045 --> 01:26:26,036
Julia, why?

695
01:26:27,282 --> 01:26:31,116
- Is it all about the money?
- Isn't it always?

696
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:38,187
Police! Stop!

697
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:40,361
It's Agent Hyde.
I just rescued the boy from Zolo.

698
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:41,961
Stop her!

699
01:26:43,064 --> 01:26:46,556
- She's got the drugs in the bag!
- Arrest them. We'll sort it out.

700
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:48,668
- Don't move!
- She kidnapped Sam.

701
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,701
- He's right. She is lying.
- Shut up.

702
01:26:50,905 --> 01:26:52,497
- Come on.
- No, I'm not going!

703
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:57,406
That's far enough, Miss Hyde.
Your game's over.

704
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:04,351
Hand me over the child.

705
01:27:04,919 --> 01:27:08,047
Vasu, arrest her.

706
01:27:08,623 --> 01:27:12,150
- Get the gun from her.
- Give me the gun! The gun!

707
01:27:13,027 --> 01:27:14,858
Salim, get the child.

708
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:33,241
- Stop or I'll drop him! I swear!
- Dad, help!

709
01:27:33,448 --> 01:27:35,382
I said stop!

710
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:38,342
I swear to God, take one more step
and he's dead.

711
01:27:38,553 --> 01:27:40,453
Dad, help!

712
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:44,852
Give me back my son.

713
01:27:47,862 --> 01:27:51,798
I want everyone to get in their cars
and drive away.

714
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,195
I want safe passage out of here.

715
01:27:55,236 --> 01:27:59,536
- Agreed. Give me the boy.
- Don't fuck with me, Kumar.

716
01:27:59,741 --> 01:28:04,178
- I'm not leaving without the boy.
- Dad! Help!

717
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:08,879
- Stop it!
- Dad, help!

718
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:17,047
Julia, I know you.
I know you wouldn't hurt Sam.

719
01:28:17,325 --> 01:28:20,123
- You trust me?
- Help!

720
01:28:23,831 --> 01:28:27,062
Julia, enough.

721
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:28,994
It's over.

722
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:32,098
There's no way out of this
and you know that.

723
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:36,867
Please. Let Sam go.

724
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:42,281
I'm gonna count to three.

725
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:45,077
Either you do what I say or he dies.

726
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:46,909
- One.
- Dad!

727
01:28:47,255 --> 01:28:49,746
- Two.
- Okay.

728
01:28:49,957 --> 01:28:55,691
Okay. You will get what you ask for.
We are leaving now.

729
01:28:57,765 --> 01:29:00,393
Everybody out now. Doctor, leave.

730
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:08,099
Salim, get a car ready for her.

731
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:41,342
Is the boy okay?

732
01:29:42,076 --> 01:29:43,941
I think so.

733
01:29:44,145 --> 01:29:46,079
It's okay, buddy. It's all over.

734
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,976
I knew you'd come.
I knew you would.

735
01:29:58,326 --> 01:30:01,295
You're getting soft
in your middle age.

736
01:30:03,564 --> 01:30:07,625
You're just getting soft...
in the middle.

737
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:11,604
Come on, boys.

738
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:17,142
Nice looking boy.

739
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:26,314
Your daddy loves you.
You be a good boy.

740
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:42,828
Look for the bags.

741
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:49,171
- Can we go home now?
- Yes, Sam. That's a great idea.
