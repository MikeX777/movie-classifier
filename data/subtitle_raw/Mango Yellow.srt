1
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:08,867
There are times when I just wonder
about the way things happen.

2
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:18,744
First, comes the day. Then, everything
happens on that day.

3
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:24,786
Then comes the night-the best part!

4
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:30,151
But then right after that,
comes the day again!

5
00:03:30,393 --> 00:03:35,626
And on and on and on...
never-ending!

6
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:40,261
The only thing that hasn't changed
lately is that Santa Cruz...

7
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,200
hasn't won a single game...
not even a title of honour!

8
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:51,441
And I... haven't found anyone
that deserves me...

9
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,516
Love always goes wrong...

10
00:04:00,056 --> 00:04:04,186
I just wish the whole world
would go and fuck itself!

11
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:15,532
Good morning Nita, up there
on Paradise Hill.

12
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:17,672
Good morning Argemiro
and Inácia.

13
00:04:17,874 --> 00:04:19,637
Good morning to all the crowd
up there on the Hill.

14
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,902
And Cannibal, how're doing?
Ronrona, Peste, Marcelo,

15
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:26,411
Celo Brown, Dito de Oxossi, how's
everything going overthere, brother?

16
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:28,982
Good morning too, to everywhere
on Shooter's Hill.

17
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:34,350
A very good morning, and here's
hoping that this 16th July

18
00:04:34,557 --> 00:04:39,358
is filled with happiness.
'Stay full of cheer...

19
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:42,429
'cos tonight there'll be cheap beer.'

20
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:51,601
And now, let's turn
to the morning news.

21
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:57,675
A very respectable housewife
found her husband with his lover.

22
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,907
Things turned rough. She, an
evangelical, pounced on...

23
00:05:02,118 --> 00:05:05,315
Miss So-and-so, and all
hell broke loose.

24
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:09,685
Result: The loverended up
in hospital and no one's...

25
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:13,658
seen hair nor hide
of the betrayed wife.

26
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,661
Well, that's it,
the main news.

27
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:26,240
More news in a few minutes.
This is yourCity Soup,

28
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:30,469
always keeping you informed,
because after all,

29
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,308
life is not that hard in Recife.

30
00:05:33,516 --> 00:05:37,646
To catch a minibus,
forexample, is easy...

31
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:41,950
and for a minibus to
catch you-is even easier.

32
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:47,892
'Stay full of cheer 'cos tonight
there'll be cheap beer.'

33
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,122
That 's the way it goes.
This is City Soup.

34
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:53,791
Always here with the latest news.

35
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:02,776
Now, let's go overto the day's
news. More police news.

36
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:05,675
Another police case. Well,
it would be if the police...

37
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:07,713
themselves weren't the
main suspects of killing two

38
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:12,217
boys that were found in the bathroom
of the Jean Paul Sartre School.

39
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:16,518
They were both 14 and were said
to have been killed by...

40
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:20,355
2 policemen on routine patrol.

41
00:06:20,563 --> 00:06:24,329
The motive: Cannabis!

42
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:28,334
The thing is that the witnesses
don't want to talk, and those

43
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:32,269
who do talk only know from
hearsay. That's the way it goes.

44
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:36,502
This is City Soup-the truth
every day on your radio.

45
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,916
- Hallelujah, brothers!
- Hallelujah!

46
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:45,019
We must fear the Devil
and glorify the Lord!

47
00:06:45,455 --> 00:06:46,547
Glory!

48
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:50,157
We must never leave a space
open in our minds for Satan...

49
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:52,827
to invade our hearts, amen?!

50
00:06:53,596 --> 00:06:57,794
...to make it his home! Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

51
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,802
The weapon against suffering is the
belief in Our Lord Jesus Christ! Amen!

52
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:07,702
- Praise be to God!!!
- Praise the Lord!!!

53
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:24,824
If I am capable of killing a man?

54
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:29,453
Of all the species that walk
this earth, man is the...

55
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:31,565
one creature that deserves to die.

56
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:33,428
In fact, I killed a man once.

57
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:38,300
That 's why they call me Cannibal...
Wellington Cannibal!

58
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:45,245
Look, the only thing I could
never do is kill Kika!

59
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:48,713
She's not most beautiful woman
in the world, no, but she's the best

60
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:55,585
'cos she's evangelical! Yea...
May God keep her that way...

61
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:57,759
And by God, I'll tell you
something, pal,

62
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:01,392
I trust Kika more than myself...

63
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:07,161
she says the most beautiful things...

64
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:31,858
You took the piss, you're yellow,
this will not go amiss...

65
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:36,327
You took the piss, you're yellow,
this will not go amiss...

66
00:08:36,532 --> 00:08:40,093
inside this box is an indigent body
a body without voice,

67
00:08:40,303 --> 00:08:41,964
a body without feelings...

68
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:46,335
inside this box is an indigent body,
a body without voice...

69
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:48,100
Excuse me Aurora...

70
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:49,676
a body without feelings...

71
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:54,907
You took the piss, you're yellow,
this will not go amiss,

72
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:58,244
and inside this box...

73
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:01,582
Bianor, Bianor!!
What are you looking for?

74
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,418
The store key, Dunga...

75
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,958
Isn't it on the third hook?

76
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:09,092
Well, I'll be... there it is...
I've been looking all over

77
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,925
for this darned key...

78
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,364
Mr. Bianor, Mr. Bianor! I'd say
you're going half blind?

79
00:09:14,604 --> 00:09:17,903
The key is in the same place as
always and the man can't even find it.

80
00:09:21,877 --> 00:09:27,543
Texas Hotel, at your service...
hmhmm... I don't know... I'll see...

81
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,183
Dunga, is Isaac up yet?

82
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:33,487
That? Up before ten?

83
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:38,285
So go and call him. Tell him it 's
urgent. It 's some... Rabecão.

84
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:41,727
All right, but you
know how he gets.

85
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:45,264
Looks like a wild beast with those
squashed up piggy eyes.

86
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:42,057
Mr. Isaac...

87
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,350
what the fuck d'you want?

88
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,222
- Mr. Isaac...
- What the fuck is it?

89
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,091
There's a phone
call for your excellency.

90
00:10:49,298 --> 00:10:51,266
Rabecão would like to speak
to his highness.

91
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:55,164
Get fucked! Is he still on the line?

92
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:59,306
Answer you miserable poofter...
is he still on the line?!

93
00:10:59,508 --> 00:11:01,840
Fuck... shit.

94
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,746
Bollocks!

95
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,661
Yes? Of course it 's
me, Rabecão... yeah!

96
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,858
The voice of someone who
just got up, you bastard!

97
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:34,503
What is it? No... no...

98
00:11:37,146 --> 00:11:41,810
And I'm gonna get upset
because of that?

99
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:45,851
Hang on...
Fuck! Hey! Bianor.

100
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:49,752
Put the fucking extension
back on the hook!

101
00:11:50,226 --> 00:11:54,890
Look, I'll meet you at the usual
place in 4O minutes!

102
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,562
Of course I'll take the stash,
for fuck's sake.

103
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,135
No, it 's all planned,
arranged and decided...

104
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:07,170
I'm telling you... I've hit it
right on the head, OK!

105
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:12,677
Wow, Rabecão: Great!

106
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:16,545
Fucking hell,
fucking hell, fucking hell!

107
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,244
- 'Morning, Bianor!
- Morning!

108
00:12:49,452 --> 00:12:51,443
Hey, Dunga was
getting worked up.

109
00:12:51,654 --> 00:12:53,849
Go straight through
to the kitchen, Wellington.

110
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:55,956
He's expecting you.

111
00:12:56,592 --> 00:13:00,187
God save Wellington... What?

112
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,129
What are you looking at
me like that for?

113
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:05,323
Hang the meat on that hook. Go on...

114
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:08,463
Put your meat really near me, go on.

115
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,755
What?

116
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:32,860
I know... You've started?

117
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:37,795
You're getting your fangs
ready to pounce, eh?

118
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,302
Yes... but don't get scared.
Don't knock it 'til you've tried it.

119
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:47,169
Clean all that skin off and leave
it really smooth and clean.

120
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,754
For fuck's sake Dunga!

121
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,758
Why don't you go and throw this
Shit over the bitch that...

122
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:08,827
the bad luck of having you, eh?!

123
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:11,499
Fuck and bollocks!

124
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,602
Every day this fucking queer throws
this fucking stuff over me!

125
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:22,039
You're a fucking pain Dunga.
I'll fuck you good and proper.

126
00:14:22,478 --> 00:14:24,571
Mmm... sure...

127
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:29,844
You're a fucking pain.
A fucking pain.

128
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,214
And... Kika? How's she?

129
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:40,327
Thank God, she's on the right
track. An evangelical.

130
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,925
One of these days I'll be going
down the same road.

131
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,261
I should give up smoking.

132
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,233
She's a lucky woman... she likes
her meat then, does she?

133
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:56,639
No... she's not that good in bed...
but she's a good woman.

134
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:59,177
A believer...

135
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:42,650
Modesty is the most intelligent
form of perversion.

136
00:15:58,307 --> 00:15:59,365
Which one, Lígia?

137
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:02,567
Hang on! I'm thinking.

138
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,038
Last night I dreamt
about today.

139
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:12,087
You know something?
I've seen all this before.

140
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:17,385
It 's all already happened.

141
00:16:18,994 --> 00:16:20,586
Isn't today
the 16th of June?

142
00:16:20,796 --> 00:16:23,458
Sure... today I'm another year older.

143
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:26,457
Ha! You're getting old?

144
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:29,331
Not old! Experienced...

145
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:35,009
All right then... I'll play today's
date in the first to the fifth

146
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,647
in both games. And do another too,
with the numbers reversed.

147
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:43,375
6, 16... a good game, huh?

148
00:16:43,986 --> 00:16:46,454
- What was yesterday's result?
- The dog.

149
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:49,988
Fuck! And I put my
money on the cow.

150
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:54,185
Let 's make amends
for our guilt here...

151
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:57,660
I'm not a rich man, but
I still feel guilty.

152
00:16:57,866 --> 00:17:00,926
To have any sense at all in
Brazil is motive enough to feel guilt!

153
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:06,802
Oh no! The show's about to start...
I saw this in my dream too.

154
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:10,612
God! What a miserable life...

155
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:15,648
Hey, beautiful! Aren't you going
to bring us our breakfast?

156
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:19,746
- See you, Lígia.
- Bring us a beer!

157
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,660
See you around, Mr. Bianor.

158
00:17:35,938 --> 00:17:40,773
Today is confused,
but happiness reigns.

159
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,308
Long live Denmark!

160
00:17:44,246 --> 00:17:46,874
Heh! Isaac!

161
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:53,047
What else can
we expect of life?

162
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,321
Fucking hell!

163
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:04,462
Dunga! Dunga! Little Dunga!

164
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:08,095
Oh! For God's sake! What?
Where's the fire?

165
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:12,066
The priest is going to eat
with us today, you hear?

166
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:16,568
What 's the matter?
Are you crying?

167
00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:21,873
Of course I'm not, it 's
the fucking onions!

168
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:26,314
Onions... there's always something.

169
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,184
It 's all I need.

170
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:37,727
May the light of God
shine upon us.

171
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,435
Illuminating our souls...

172
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,164
with love...

173
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,469
Nobody is innocent.

174
00:18:49,678 --> 00:18:53,637
Man's hope lost
a long time ago.

175
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:58,445
Pain appears and screams
from every corner.

176
00:18:58,654 --> 00:19:02,590
The humanists pity themselves
from the rail of the pulpit!

177
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:07,853
But, may they pity themselves of their
own souls, because it is exactly

178
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:12,864
the pride of goodness that
resides in almost every sin.

179
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:19,735
Man dies, the world burns out
and the flames are consumed...

180
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:23,841
but excess accompanies the vacuum.

181
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:32,779
Kika Cannibal!

182
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,860
Kika Cannibal!

183
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:06,204
Lígia, my little mango,
give me my medicine...

184
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,899
and some
gizzards to pick at.

185
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:13,047
There's no gizzards... but there's
a little liver, will that do?

186
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,115
And why not, flower of my life?

187
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:20,311
Well, I'm gonna grab that pretty arse!

188
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:27,719
Another beer! And so I heard this
story about the Argentinians.

189
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:34,426
Load of wankers! One of them said,
'first we stop being Argentinians

190
00:22:34,636 --> 00:22:37,298
and become Spanish! '

191
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:47,611
Show me, show me a Brazilian who
can tell someone who's Spanish

192
00:22:47,816 --> 00:22:50,080
from someone who's not?

193
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,948
Well, after a load of bollocks, they
spoke the hallowed phrase,

194
00:22:54,156 --> 00:22:57,319
the real treasure of Brazilian thought!

195
00:22:57,526 --> 00:23:00,825
The phrase that humiliates
anthropologists.

196
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:07,329
'Let 's buy a car. In Brazil a car is
worth more than character! '

197
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:12,166
I hate the Argentinians, but I have
to give credit to his phrases...

198
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:14,436
And the conclusion was brilliant!

199
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:18,511
'Brazilians foster...

200
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:22,706
a certain admiration
for wheedling.

201
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:29,685
The average Brazilian
loves being cheated. '

202
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,623
Go and slap your mother's
arse, you fucking prat!

203
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:33,817
What the fuck?

204
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:39,831
Go shove it up your arse! You reckon
my arse is your mother's cunt?

205
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:42,435
Fuck off, you hear, go fuck yourself!

206
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:44,662
And you get your
fucking hands off me!

207
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:48,536
Fuck off to work
you load of bastards!

208
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,590
Dunga my boy, bring
me a glass of water.

209
00:24:04,793 --> 00:24:06,693
And the vegetable list.
I'm off to the market.

210
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:12,891
Right away. Ah, Bianor,
bring me a box of bobbins.

211
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:23,497
Where the fuck have you been!

212
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:26,367
Calm down, calm down.

213
00:25:26,908 --> 00:25:30,435
- So? Where is it?
- Inside.

214
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,040
What state is it in?
Is it very damaged?

215
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:37,741
Well, the body is a little
perforated, but it 'll do fine.

216
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:44,452
- Is it cold?
- Cold? Like an iced lolly.

217
00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:46,991
Fucking hell!

218
00:25:49,531 --> 00:25:53,991
Take good care of that. It
doesn't have an owner, but...

219
00:25:54,202 --> 00:25:58,332
...as I said... I'm just warning you.
- Fine. Now, get going.

220
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:04,639
And, Isaac, don't forget. I'm waiting
for you at the Avenida Bar.

221
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:00,999
Daisy!

222
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:09,804
Hang on, Wellington,
you fucking stink!

223
00:27:10,011 --> 00:27:13,208
Look here Well, I'm up
to here with all this!

224
00:27:13,415 --> 00:27:14,439
What 's this, my love?

225
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:19,211
Huh! What 's this? You're
going to have to choose.

226
00:27:19,421 --> 00:27:21,889
I won't go on being known
as the slag around here.

227
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,457
That I'm no good, I'm bad, a tart...

228
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,993
Yesterday, dad, who can't even
walk straight, looked at me

229
00:27:29,197 --> 00:27:31,995
and in one mouthful just
called me 'a slut '!

230
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,100
- Kika, Kika...
- Fuck Kika!

231
00:27:34,302 --> 00:27:38,363
- Daisy my love... listen...
- Stuff your 'my love'!

232
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,562
You're fucking difficult?

233
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:43,801
What the fuck are you on
about now, Wellington?

234
00:27:44,012 --> 00:27:48,608
Wellington, my father called me a slut.
And do you know why?

235
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:51,479
You bloody don't, do you?
Because of you!

236
00:27:51,686 --> 00:27:55,053
- You went and told him.
- Of course I told him, you soft idiot!

237
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:58,692
But he's beginning to work out
that I am with a married man.

238
00:27:58,893 --> 00:28:02,124
A "ghost-boyfriend" is always married.
I just hope to God he never

239
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,265
realises it 's you... especially with
the way he feels about Kika.

240
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:06,491
That soft bitch.

241
00:28:06,701 --> 00:28:08,828
Not a soft bitch! Kika is an
evangelical! She's the type that...

242
00:28:09,037 --> 00:28:10,766
Christians are the biggest
sluts of all.

243
00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:13,941
Say that again! Say
it again if you dare!

244
00:28:14,142 --> 00:28:16,804
Christians are the
biggest sluts of all!

245
00:28:18,213 --> 00:28:20,545
Go on, hit me Wellington!
Hit me!

246
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:22,080
Fuck...

247
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:26,481
you're man enough, aren't you?
So go on -hit me, Cannibal!

248
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:30,580
Look here Daisy, don't tempt me.
Otherwise you'll regret it.

249
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,454
You'll come out the worse! If your
father, who knows you well,

250
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:36,459
calls you a slut, then it 's because
you deserve it! Get it?

251
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:39,963
And don't think I'm going to beat
your face to shit, because I'm not!

252
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:42,068
But you fucking deserve it!
I'm just warning you that

253
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,259
it 's the one thing
I'd really enjoy doing.

254
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,599
Now look here, never open your
mouth about Kika again, never!

255
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,800
Show some respect for her!
If not I'll do you up!

256
00:28:50,011 --> 00:28:54,505
D'you get it? Never speak like that
about Kika again, do you hear!

257
00:28:54,716 --> 00:28:56,809
I'm off.

258
00:29:15,737 --> 00:29:18,797
Today I'm going over to the
Santería House... oh yes!

259
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,499
You'll see what I can do.
I'll get you all right Cannibal.

260
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:25,243
I've already started a spell and it 'll
only be over when I've got you

261
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:30,510
in the palm of my hand, here!
Right here!

262
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:35,922
Go to your precious little Kika.
That slimy Daisy! Go!

263
00:29:36,124 --> 00:29:40,083
This is for you!
Rice! Rice!

264
00:29:43,131 --> 00:29:49,798
I'll finish with the two of them!
Fucking women!

265
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:54,540
Huh! Nothing matches
the fury of a determined queen, dear!

266
00:29:54,742 --> 00:30:00,544
I'll only rest when I'm 6 feet under!

267
00:30:01,115 --> 00:30:05,108
I may not be a woman - but I'll
get what I want. I will!

268
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,986
God forgive me, but I'll do anything,
I'm not playing around here!

269
00:30:12,827 --> 00:30:19,130
And as for that one - 'Jesus is love',
'salvation' -for fuck's sake!!

270
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:24,701
Daisy... Daisy is just
a shit-bag, a slag.

271
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,239
Addicted to married men!

272
00:30:30,645 --> 00:30:32,636
God forgive me, but they say
she's even had dykes...

273
00:30:32,847 --> 00:30:36,578
licking those tits, dear!
Slag! Slag!

274
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:41,084
And being the slag
she is, it must be true.

275
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:43,621
Now Daisy...

276
00:30:44,492 --> 00:30:50,829
I would never swap a man like
Wellington for some old dyke, dear!

277
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:57,094
Lesbian... I'll get it all sorted out all
right! When she goes to the Santero...

278
00:30:57,305 --> 00:31:01,639
I'll get her sorted. Plant today
and harvest tomorrow.

279
00:31:03,077 --> 00:31:07,673
Be fucked if I'm playing
around! I'll do it!

280
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:12,845
Dunga my boy, is there ever going
to be any lunch today?

281
00:31:13,054 --> 00:31:14,715
It 's coming, it 's coming Aurora.

282
00:31:14,923 --> 00:31:17,892
Stay talking to Bianor and when it 's
ready I'll give you a call. Right?

283
00:31:18,092 --> 00:31:20,720
You look as if you're up to
no good, Little Dunga.

284
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:22,692
I've seen this face before...

285
00:31:22,897 --> 00:31:25,991
oh god! Aurora, I'm not in the mood
for jokes today. Stay with Bianor.

286
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:30,796
If not the food'll never
be ready today. Go on!

287
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:06,903
You liked the material then?
As yellow as a mango!

288
00:32:07,141 --> 00:32:12,511
Fuck me, but that 's one hell
of a woman! Who's she?

289
00:32:12,714 --> 00:32:17,879
The she-wolf of the Avenida Bar.
She's a crazy bitch.

290
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:20,611
Looks like a whore but nobody
here has ever had her.

291
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,421
You're joking?

292
00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:26,958
I don't joke, Isaac? And the 'ham'?
Was it too far gone?

293
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:31,598
What ham? Ah... it 's there.
I don't think it 's any worse

294
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:34,734
...than it was before.

295
00:32:34,936 --> 00:32:38,201
- And the weed?
- In the car, 5OO grams.

296
00:32:38,406 --> 00:32:40,704
So let 's get going. I'm all out.

297
00:32:40,908 --> 00:32:42,500
Just a minute Rabecão.
I'll tell you what.

298
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,238
You get the weed out of the car,
from under the passenger seat.

299
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:51,278
I'll stay around here
for a while. All right?

300
00:32:53,521 --> 00:32:58,220
I get you. You want to have
it with blondie there.

301
00:33:00,528 --> 00:33:04,191
Well, if you manage
to bang that one...

302
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,993
I'll give you back the dosh...

303
00:33:07,201 --> 00:33:10,193
and you can even
fuck me up the arse.

304
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,999
Fucking poofter...
keep your arse to yourself.

305
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:17,166
But, I'll take you up on the dosh.

306
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:23,308
No deal. You'll have to take
my arse! No arse, no deal.

307
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,178
Get out of here, you fucking poof!

308
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:31,415
And Rabecão, if another jewel
like that one turns up...

309
00:33:31,893 --> 00:33:34,225
Get the bill, ok?

310
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:43,129
Heh, young lady! I need one here.

311
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,242
Kika Cannibal!

312
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:56,280
For God's sake, Wellington,
what 's this all about?

313
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,754
I do everything I can
to stay out of trouble.

314
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:04,083
I do no harm to any one,
I give no trouble to anyone.

315
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:08,626
And what do I get in return?
Kika Cannibal...

316
00:34:09,764 --> 00:34:13,097
oh Kika, it 's all just kid's talk.

317
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:18,102
You know how they love getting
decent people all wound up?

318
00:34:18,906 --> 00:34:21,568
Look at what happened to Suian.

319
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,703
- The manicurist?
- That 's the one.

320
00:34:24,912 --> 00:34:27,039
The kids went and told
the whole villa not to get...

321
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:30,183
their nails done with her
because she's got AIDS?

322
00:34:31,252 --> 00:34:35,245
Kid's pranks, Kika... little bastards.

323
00:34:35,523 --> 00:34:40,256
Wellington! I've asked you once,
twice, a million times!

324
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:45,728
If you want to swear, do it with your
friends in the bar. But not here.

325
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,134
Under this roof, I demand respect.
In the name of Jesus.

326
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,806
Sorry Kika, sorry.

327
00:34:55,877 --> 00:34:59,540
She deserved it though,
she betrayed him...

328
00:35:01,582 --> 00:35:02,981
What was that?

329
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:07,484
Suian! She had what
was coming to her.

330
00:35:08,156 --> 00:35:13,890
She betrayed her husband. Everyone
knew. It was too little for her.

331
00:35:16,964 --> 00:35:19,432
One thing, Wellington...

332
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:23,934
one thing I really cannot
forgive... betrayal.

333
00:35:24,138 --> 00:35:26,470
I really can't.

334
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:30,937
Murder, violence, robbing,
all this I can tolerate...

335
00:35:31,145 --> 00:35:33,477
but not betrayal.

336
00:35:39,353 --> 00:35:42,049
I find adultery repugnant!

337
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:47,287
The adulterer too.

338
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:59,032
Whoever strikes the first blow,
always gets the blow returned.

339
00:36:02,376 --> 00:36:05,106
I can't even think about it.

340
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,609
- And the capital of Korea?
- Seoul.

341
00:36:46,254 --> 00:36:49,587
- And the capital of Chile?
- Santiago.

342
00:36:51,092 --> 00:36:54,425
- And the capital of Afghanistan?
- Kabul.

343
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:01,191
- And the capital of Venezuela?
- Caracas.

344
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:05,361
- And Egypt?
- Egypt is Cairo.

345
00:37:05,673 --> 00:37:09,666
- And... of... of Peru?
- Lima.

346
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:13,771
Bless you, Aurora.

347
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:18,975
Bless you? You only say bless you
when people sneeze, she's coughing?

348
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:26,859
Oh my God, lift your arms, Aurora.
Lift your arms!

349
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:32,124
Water, water, drink some water.
Here, here, swallow it.

350
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,995
Drink. Drink, drink, drink, drink,
drink, drink. Drink,

351
00:37:35,202 --> 00:37:40,367
dri-dri-dri-drink. Swallow it,
swallow. That 's it.

352
00:37:40,574 --> 00:37:46,240
Breathe slowly. That 's it,
breathe. There you are.

353
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:52,882
My God, every day... how I choke.

354
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:55,487
Must be for the sins of another time.

355
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,854
What probation, my God.
It 's always the same.

356
00:38:00,227 --> 00:38:02,525
Seems as though there's
something else!

357
00:38:02,763 --> 00:38:04,526
Leave out the drama, Aurora!

358
00:38:04,732 --> 00:38:08,828
You're putting up the circus tent!
It 's all passed, dear. Go on!

359
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,504
Swallow the chicken slowly,
take water with it.

360
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:15,767
- It 's the rice.
- What? The rice? Why the rice?

361
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:18,241
Bianor thinks that the rice has
got to be like porridge so that

362
00:38:18,446 --> 00:38:22,109
she doesn't choke. I don't know
how to make rice like porridge.

363
00:38:23,985 --> 00:38:26,453
My breathing isn't very
good at the best of times...

364
00:38:26,654 --> 00:38:28,246
and then choking like this...

365
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:31,717
Aurora, you always say that you
are paying for something.

366
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:35,692
That it 's this, or it 's that. But, just
think for a moment with me.

367
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:39,332
Forgiveness. Forgiveness is granted
because of what we are,

368
00:38:39,533 --> 00:38:42,934
and punishment is never the
equivalent of what we have done.

369
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:48,167
And one more thing to think
about-choking. Isn't that an excellent

370
00:38:48,376 --> 00:38:53,279
form of punishment. Think about
your past. Look at your present.

371
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:56,450
Take the true measure of what
you consider to be punishment.

372
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:59,619
- And the capital of Syria?
- Damascus.

373
00:39:10,131 --> 00:39:12,827
My little mango. Another one.

374
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:16,697
And another one over here!

375
00:39:28,049 --> 00:39:29,846
Is all your hair this colour...

376
00:39:30,051 --> 00:39:33,714
or can you only afford to dye
the hair on your head?

377
00:40:03,284 --> 00:40:07,948
Hi, Mr. Sá. Do me a favour, will you?
Keep an eye on the stall

378
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,350
...while I make
a quick call over there?

379
00:40:10,558 --> 00:40:13,721
All right, but be quick, I can't
stay looking after it very long?

380
00:40:13,928 --> 00:40:15,623
You're just great, aren't you, Mr. Sá?

381
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,560
You're the expert in asking for
things, but to help out others.

382
00:40:18,766 --> 00:40:21,963
What a useless tyke you are.
I'm only popping over there to the...

383
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:25,627
video shop.
I'll be back quickly.

384
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:37,401
Hello? Just a minute.
Cannibal back from lunch yet?

385
00:41:38,012 --> 00:41:40,344
Cannibal, the phone!

386
00:41:41,382 --> 00:41:43,816
For me? I'm on my way...

387
00:41:58,465 --> 00:42:05,132
Daisy, Uh? Look Daisy, you're
out of order? It 's not right!

388
00:42:05,906 --> 00:42:11,776
You're a fucking cow! Fuck
off Daisy... no, no, no, no!

389
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:18,646
And don't talk to me like that!
Look! No... no.

390
00:42:19,186 --> 00:42:21,814
You wouldn't dare...
I'll beat the shit out of you!

391
00:42:22,022 --> 00:42:24,616
I'll beat the shit out of you,
do you hear Daisy!

392
00:42:24,825 --> 00:42:27,487
Calm down, calm down!

393
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,462
Today! It 's got to be today?

394
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:37,197
I don't believe this... you never
give up do you, Daisy? Eh? Eh?

395
00:42:37,404 --> 00:42:39,429
Ah, you're in a hurry?

396
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:44,805
Today, in Campinho. In Campinho
I just want to tell you one thing, Daisy.

397
00:42:45,112 --> 00:42:48,172
Don't set me up, ok, because... Hello?

398
00:42:48,382 --> 00:42:52,819
Hello? Hello! Fucking bitch!

399
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,956
Hey! You row with your tarts and then
take it out on my fucking phone!

400
00:42:57,157 --> 00:43:00,888
Sorry... This woman drives me mad!

401
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:07,832
I am not entirely unhappy with
the situation at my church.

402
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:12,070
One thing I can't complain
about is my flock.

403
00:43:12,273 --> 00:43:16,141
In fact, they don't
bother me at all.

404
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:17,742
The church is closed.

405
00:43:17,945 --> 00:43:24,009
There are no images any more.
They were stolen. No masses. And so?

406
00:43:24,218 --> 00:43:29,155
It makes no difference to me.
The most important thing is God!

407
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:32,689
The rest is the rest.
Don't you think I'm right?

408
00:43:32,893 --> 00:43:37,523
Hmm. Who am I to contradict
you? You must be right.

409
00:43:37,731 --> 00:43:41,258
Bianor, these people have plenty of
places to practice their beliefs!

410
00:43:41,468 --> 00:43:45,666
The protestant temples,
the Santería Temples!

411
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,137
The psychiatric clinics!

412
00:43:48,342 --> 00:43:50,936
Why don't they leave
my church in peace?

413
00:43:51,145 --> 00:43:54,512
I can't help thinking that
if things go on this way.

414
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,275
One day it 'll just
come to an end by itself.

415
00:43:57,484 --> 00:44:02,353
You're right!
People like ostentation!

416
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,889
If there's no ostentation
then there's no church.

417
00:44:06,126 --> 00:44:08,424
I am relaxed about it.

418
00:44:08,629 --> 00:44:11,359
I'll tell Dunga to prepare
the soup for dinner.

419
00:44:15,769 --> 00:44:19,432
Texas Hotel at your service.

420
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,736
Just a moment.

421
00:44:24,778 --> 00:44:29,442
Dunga! Dunga my boy! Telephone.

422
00:44:33,354 --> 00:44:36,983
- Dunga?
- Daisy?

423
00:44:37,191 --> 00:44:39,853
What a surprise. Your ears
must have been burning.

424
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,827
Iwanted to ask you a favour. I'll be
quick, because I can't talk long.

425
00:44:45,032 --> 00:44:47,762
I can't go to the Santería Temple
today. Tell Father Adão that...

426
00:44:47,968 --> 00:44:50,061
I have to go somewhere else today.

427
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,295
The queen will be
stamping her foot, dear.

428
00:44:52,506 --> 00:44:54,235
Tell him it's urgent.

429
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:57,340
Wellington.

430
00:44:57,544 --> 00:44:59,705
Going down on rough trade, dear?

431
00:45:00,514 --> 00:45:03,915
That 's low Dunga.
It 's nothing like that.

432
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:07,519
I'm finishing everything tonight.
I can't go on. I'm tired of it.

433
00:45:07,721 --> 00:45:09,586
This married man
business is a fucking pain.

434
00:45:10,657 --> 00:45:13,353
And where is the capoeira
session going to be?

435
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,585
Should be a hot fight,
shouldn't it?

436
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,787
Over in Campinho de Euclides.

437
00:45:18,065 --> 00:45:19,464
- Now?
- No, no, no.

438
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:24,626
Early evening. I'm going to tell
him a few home truths tonight!

439
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:26,772
I'm going to tell him everything.
I'm finishing because...

440
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:31,308
I'm fed up with it. I
can't take any more!

441
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:33,207
You've decided then?

442
00:45:33,414 --> 00:45:38,147
Sure. So you'll do this favour
for me? Talk to Father Adão?

443
00:45:38,552 --> 00:45:41,885
Girl, you're a real friend... thanks!
May the gods send you...

444
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:44,353
a real hunk of a man!

445
00:45:44,558 --> 00:45:46,492
I just hope they're listening!

446
00:45:46,693 --> 00:45:48,820
- See you!
- See you.

447
00:45:51,098 --> 00:45:55,558
Dunga my boy, make use of the
leftover beans for tonight 's soup.

448
00:45:55,769 --> 00:45:57,896
There's no good delivering the goods
after I've got the whole thing ready!

449
00:45:58,105 --> 00:45:59,936
The soup is nearly ready...

450
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:04,577
Bianor... I've got
to pop out later...

451
00:46:04,778 --> 00:46:07,770
but I'll be quick, all right?

452
00:46:10,984 --> 00:46:15,648
I'm pulling out of this bar.
I can't stand any more of this shit.

453
00:46:18,058 --> 00:46:21,459
Nor any of these shitty little
customers. Look at that one.

454
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,724
The things we have to put up with...

455
00:46:23,931 --> 00:46:29,267
It 's incredible. Its like we
have to pay to watch this.

456
00:46:30,938 --> 00:46:33,600
Júlia pour me a fire-water.

457
00:46:45,986 --> 00:46:49,319
Your hair brings ideas!
Millions of ideas!

458
00:46:51,124 --> 00:46:55,254
Shut your mouth! Who do you think
I am? Fucking queer! Fuck off!

459
00:46:55,462 --> 00:46:58,488
Ideas! Trinkets! Millions of ideas!

460
00:46:58,699 --> 00:47:01,031
Turn him out.

461
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,226
Ideas! Trinkets! Millions of ideas!

462
00:47:03,437 --> 00:47:07,066
Throw him into the street. Into the
street! Get out of here! Get out!

463
00:47:08,375 --> 00:47:12,334
You're going to have
pay for what you had!

464
00:47:12,546 --> 00:47:16,312
Get it! For fuck's sake!

465
00:47:16,517 --> 00:47:22,478
I can't take this shit any longer!
I can't take any more of this shit!

466
00:47:47,648 --> 00:47:51,311
The human being is
just stomach and sex.

467
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,955
And inside there is condemnation...

468
00:47:56,523 --> 00:48:00,118
to be obligatorily free.

469
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:05,354
But he kills and he kills
himself from the fearof living.

470
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,468
And so because of this,
my eyes are blinded...

471
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:16,366
so that I cannot see even
the spit of these sinners.

472
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:20,170
My ears hear a voice that is saying:

473
00:48:20,514 --> 00:48:22,141
'Father.

474
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:27,752
There is no pain in dying.
Father, dying doesn't hurt.'

475
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,586
And we are all condemned.

476
00:48:31,792 --> 00:48:36,456
Eternally condemned.
Condemned to be free.

477
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,067
We're going to have
lunch now, all right?

478
00:48:42,269 --> 00:48:44,703
We're going to have lunch, all right.

479
00:48:44,905 --> 00:48:47,032
Because you're
the only faithful ones...

480
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,834
you are faithful, you...

481
00:48:50,043 --> 00:48:53,809
Branquinha, come here,
let 's have lunch.

482
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,983
Look, look here, take it...

483
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:01,143
Pitomba, Faisquinha...

484
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:05,348
You are the only faithful
ones, only you are faith.

485
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:07,891
Come here, here...

486
00:52:40,106 --> 00:52:42,768
Look-the German is drunk!

487
00:52:43,677 --> 00:52:47,340
Get fucked!

488
00:53:58,952 --> 00:54:01,648
- Well, did you deliver it?
- Yes!

489
00:54:01,855 --> 00:54:04,380
- What 's the number of the house?
- 13, Rua da Bola.

490
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:06,923
Fucking hell!
Well done boy!

491
00:54:07,127 --> 00:54:10,187
Look, have this. Later I'll
give you something else.

492
00:54:10,397 --> 00:54:11,921
You're almost at the right
age to get your cheese.

493
00:54:12,132 --> 00:54:14,225
Fuck off, you stupid queer!

494
00:54:17,871 --> 00:54:22,899
My dear friend, I don't desire to
cause any trouble for any body.

495
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:27,375
But when a man is unfaithful,
he needs to be unmasked.

496
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:30,378
Tonight no...

497
00:54:30,583 --> 00:54:35,282
early evening...
early...

498
00:54:35,488 --> 00:54:39,447
early tonight go to
Campo do Euclides.

499
00:54:39,659 --> 00:54:42,685
That's all lwant to say.
Open youreyes.

500
00:54:42,896 --> 00:54:46,354
An unfaithful husband
has to be unmasked.

501
00:54:46,566 --> 00:54:51,435
Early tonight. That's all.
An acquaintance.

502
00:54:51,771 --> 00:54:55,764
No, a friend...

503
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,538
A friend.

504
00:55:04,484 --> 00:55:09,148
I'm at the door and I nock, and if
someone listens to my voice...

505
00:55:09,356 --> 00:55:11,586
and opens the
door of his heart...

506
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:16,490
I will enter his house, and I will
leave with him and he with me.

507
00:55:16,696 --> 00:55:19,688
And this afternoon, Jesus Christ
wants to change your life!

508
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,391
Mr. Bianor, Mr. Bianor...

509
00:55:28,274 --> 00:55:33,075
Mr. Bianor... Mr. Bianor...

510
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:53,729
Bianor! Bianor! Mr. Bianor!

511
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:05,006
Someone! Someone!
Someone!

512
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:09,942
Mr. Bianor is dead!
Someone answer me!

513
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:26,463
Someone help! Help!

514
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:40,977
- Help!
- Hail Mary, what 's that noise?

515
01:01:51,891 --> 01:01:54,985
My God! My God! What now?!

516
01:01:56,729 --> 01:02:00,062
Calm down Dunga...
drink this sugar water.

517
01:02:02,535 --> 01:02:08,201
I never know what to do at times
like these, I never know...

518
01:02:09,609 --> 01:02:13,045
Mr. Bianor, what a
time to go and die...

519
01:02:13,246 --> 01:02:16,511
Dunga, this is a complicated situation.

520
01:02:16,716 --> 01:02:18,445
There's got to be
a death certificate...

521
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:23,520
a doctor, a coffin, and then
after... the cemetery.

522
01:02:23,723 --> 01:02:28,524
Don't get me more upset
than I already am!

523
01:02:29,562 --> 01:02:30,961
Oh God! Bianor!

524
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:34,395
Even when you die
you give me work.

525
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:48,871
Out... Aurora, you don't know
what happened...

526
01:02:49,081 --> 01:02:51,606
Speak Dunga! What is it?

527
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:56,845
Mr. Bianor... is dead...

528
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:59,256
Eh? But he was
alive a while ago?

529
01:02:59,459 --> 01:03:03,122
Of course he was! But he wasn't dead.
The dead don't die do they?

530
01:03:03,329 --> 01:03:09,097
Well, that 's all we needed.
Poor old Bianor...

531
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:14,005
But I cant ' help in
anything my flower...

532
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:17,199
And the funeral?
Everything is so confused.

533
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:20,538
I just don't know what to do.

534
01:03:20,746 --> 01:03:23,715
My head... Please,
give me some light.

535
01:03:23,916 --> 01:03:25,747
The priest, have you told
the priest, Dunga?

536
01:03:25,952 --> 01:03:28,750
And what good can he do?
The man is crazy.

537
01:03:28,955 --> 01:03:32,220
He doesn't even know how to
pray! Oh my God! Oh my God!

538
01:03:32,425 --> 01:03:34,416
I'm no good with dead bodies!

539
01:03:34,627 --> 01:03:37,095
The coffin. Before anything else,
the body needs a coffin.

540
01:03:37,296 --> 01:03:41,255
And with what money am I going
to buy a coffin? Huh? Huh?

541
01:03:41,467 --> 01:03:45,597
Bianor had some money, but God only
knows where he keep it hidden.

542
01:03:45,805 --> 01:03:48,706
Dunga, Little Dunga, you'd better talk
to one of the other guests.

543
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:52,469
I don't know what to do...
Once a cousin of mine died.

544
01:03:52,678 --> 01:03:55,272
I had to sort out a million things.

545
01:03:55,481 --> 01:03:59,212
I had to get the death certificate.
And the woman who was typing...

546
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:02,546
it kept saying all the time... I'm
scared to death of making a mistake...

547
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:05,121
I'm scared to death
of making a mistake.

548
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:07,792
I'm scared to death, Dunga...

549
01:04:16,135 --> 01:04:19,764
Mr. Isaac! Mr. Isaac!

550
01:04:47,233 --> 01:04:49,258
Please!

551
01:04:50,903 --> 01:04:54,361
What the fuck is it, Dunga?

552
01:04:54,907 --> 01:04:59,810
- It 's Mr. Bianor... he's dead.
- What 's that got to do with me?

553
01:05:00,012 --> 01:05:02,276
We don't know what to
do about the coffin.

554
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:04,972
Mr. Bianor had some money but
no one knows where he put it.

555
01:05:05,184 --> 01:05:08,517
- I don't know what to do.
- How am I supposed to know?

556
01:05:09,922 --> 01:05:13,255
See if the old man didn't
wrap it round his dick.

557
01:05:13,593 --> 01:05:17,927
Take advantage and wrap your hand
round the old boy's cock and...

558
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,792
see if you can't get some
rabbits out of the woods.

559
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,696
Or find a local councilor.

560
01:05:23,903 --> 01:05:26,098
Isn't there one that gives
coffins out to the poor?

561
01:05:26,305 --> 01:05:30,969
You're a real fucking pain in the arse.
Not even the dead do you help!

562
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:34,836
Fucking bastard!

563
01:05:35,982 --> 01:05:38,314
Ouch!

564
01:05:42,254 --> 01:05:47,920
My wallet... fucking hell!

565
01:05:48,761 --> 01:05:51,093
But I'll go there...

566
01:05:51,497 --> 01:05:54,057
I want my I.D. Card...

567
01:05:55,668 --> 01:05:58,193
I want that woman...

568
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:04,032
that fucking fag Dunga
ruined my dream...

569
01:06:04,644 --> 01:06:07,169
fuck...

570
01:06:13,319 --> 01:06:18,382
This is what it's like to
live sorting rubbish...

571
01:06:18,591 --> 01:06:23,255
when there's no education, brother.

572
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:27,429
What about creating some shame.

573
01:06:27,633 --> 01:06:34,300
Whoever heard of being a
transporterof diseases?

574
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:39,768
This is what it's like to
live sorting rubbish...

575
01:06:39,979 --> 01:06:45,178
when there's no education,
brother, brother...

576
01:06:45,384 --> 01:06:48,581
what about creating some shame...

577
01:06:48,788 --> 01:06:53,885
whoever heard of being a
transporterof diseases?

578
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:59,429
Transporterof diseases!

579
01:07:01,834 --> 01:07:08,501
That 's it, really great! Great,
it was really great!

580
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:10,903
Well, I've got to catch that train.

581
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:13,374
It 's all OK for Monday?
All right! Hey!

582
01:07:13,579 --> 01:07:17,310
Guys, only good
kids here! Get out of here!

583
01:09:29,014 --> 01:09:30,879
Who's there?

584
01:09:33,485 --> 01:09:35,953
There's no comfort here.

585
01:09:36,155 --> 01:09:39,147
These people should look for
comfort where there is comfort.

586
01:09:39,625 --> 01:09:42,116
Who's there? What do you want?

587
01:09:42,328 --> 01:09:47,322
I know that life is hard, but we
cannot bow our heads before evil...

588
01:09:47,733 --> 01:09:51,669
my guardian, I have only come
to tell you that death

589
01:09:51,871 --> 01:09:57,104
has taken Bianor, and that even
there they need your favours.

590
01:09:59,144 --> 01:10:05,572
Tell me where and I'll go. Bianor...
alive just a short time ago...

591
01:10:09,555 --> 01:10:12,888
I go cold when I think about death.

592
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:35,610
Play this card, you idiot!
Now you've fucked yourself!

593
01:11:05,711 --> 01:11:07,702
What a mess all this is.

594
01:11:07,913 --> 01:11:12,782
For fuck's sake! You always turn up
at the wrong time! And...

595
01:11:12,985 --> 01:11:15,783
- What?
- Sort out the problem?

596
01:11:15,988 --> 01:11:22,621
I found the money. It was round
the old man's balls... dirty devil.

597
01:11:23,595 --> 01:11:27,964
Didn't I tell you... it never fails.
When it 's no good for anything else

598
01:11:28,167 --> 01:11:30,135
it turns into a safe.

599
01:11:30,336 --> 01:11:33,669
Oh! Everybody, it 's all sorted out.
The coffin is arriving soon, all right?

600
01:11:45,284 --> 01:11:47,752
Daisy? Feeling calmer now?

601
01:11:47,953 --> 01:11:50,251
It 's not a question of feeling
calmer. Get it Wellington?

602
01:11:50,456 --> 01:11:51,855
I can see you're still out of control.

603
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:53,547
- Out of control?
- It looks that way.

604
01:11:53,759 --> 01:11:57,217
Me? Ha! Not at all my dear.
Just think about a controlled woman.

605
01:11:57,429 --> 01:12:02,662
Thought about one? Well, it 's me.
Wellington, I want a future.

606
01:12:02,868 --> 01:12:04,165
It 's finished, all right?

607
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:06,270
You're telling me it 's over between us?

608
01:12:06,472 --> 01:12:07,370
- Over, Wellington.
- Everything?

609
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:10,406
Everything, Wellington. It can't go
on. I can't take any more.

610
01:12:10,609 --> 01:12:12,941
I can't go on with being
'the other woman'.

611
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:17,849
It 's a pity, because...
you're one fucking hell of a man...

612
01:12:18,484 --> 01:12:20,611
- Please Wellington!
- Don't say that...

613
01:12:20,819 --> 01:12:23,310
Wait, take your hands off me?
Take them off...

614
01:12:23,522 --> 01:12:26,150
This is not the end.
It 's not the last time.

615
01:12:26,358 --> 01:12:29,657
- Just look out, Wellington.
- Go on, let 's have one for the road.

616
01:12:35,067 --> 01:12:40,232
- Traitor, traitor, traitor!
- My love... What the fuck is this?

617
01:13:00,559 --> 01:13:03,858
Cheap imitation - you bitch!

618
01:13:16,108 --> 01:13:18,702
This time it was old Bianor...

619
01:13:19,011 --> 01:13:23,345
sometimes it seems like
everyone is dying except me...

620
01:13:24,683 --> 01:13:28,585
Don't they say that it 's always
the rotten that go last?

621
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:53,170
But I am so afraid of being alone.

622
01:13:56,915 --> 01:13:58,348
Imagine.

623
01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:03,180
My house always used
to be a party. So many people.

624
01:14:06,492 --> 01:14:09,484
Now it 's only this lack
of air that 's left.

625
01:14:11,163 --> 01:14:15,691
And there's no way I am going
down there. No way!

626
01:14:19,738 --> 01:14:23,003
Not even the ghosts are left any more.

627
01:14:37,523 --> 01:14:39,491
This is good...

628
01:14:39,691 --> 01:14:42,319
it dilates the thoughts...

629
01:14:45,264 --> 01:14:51,931
Yellow is the colourof the tables,
the benches, the stools,

630
01:14:52,137 --> 01:14:58,167
the fish knife handles,
the hoe and the sickle

631
01:14:58,377 --> 01:15:04,646
the bull cart, of the yokes,
of the old hats.

632
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:06,841
Of the dried meat!

633
01:15:07,052 --> 01:15:12,354
Yellow of the diseases,
of the children's runny eyes,

634
01:15:13,258 --> 01:15:17,888
the purulent wounds, of spit,

635
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:22,362
of the worms, of hepatitis,

636
01:15:22,568 --> 01:15:28,063
of diarrhoea of the rotten teeth...

637
01:15:28,507 --> 01:15:32,170
Interior time yellow.

638
01:15:32,377 --> 01:15:37,713
Old, washed out, sick.

639
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:42,109
And that is Renato Carneiro
Campos, my boy.

640
01:15:42,921 --> 01:15:46,015
And so Isaac? You liked the home?

641
01:15:46,225 --> 01:15:50,821
- What 's up, Rabecão?
- Look, who's turned up again?

642
01:15:51,063 --> 01:15:53,554
Now you're going to see
the man who fell in love.

643
01:15:53,765 --> 01:15:56,529
There are many facets to the
human creature...

644
01:15:56,735 --> 01:16:01,604
beating, loving, beating, loving.

645
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,502
I want my I. D...

646
01:16:03,709 --> 01:16:08,305
This is all I needed. Nobody's
got your I.D., all right?

647
01:16:08,513 --> 01:16:10,777
Now just get going, I'm fed up
with bloody wankers like you.

648
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:13,474
Hang on! My friend
here is not a wanker.

649
01:16:13,685 --> 01:16:15,812
Oh! He's your friend is he?
The body snatcher.

650
01:16:16,021 --> 01:16:19,422
Well, this son of a bitch turned up
here provoking me.

651
01:16:19,625 --> 01:16:21,593
And he got the worst of it,
'cos I'm a woman!

652
01:16:21,793 --> 01:16:23,886
But even big butch buggers
like him are afraid of me.

653
01:16:24,096 --> 01:16:29,124
Well, I want my identity
and you. All of you.

654
01:16:30,602 --> 01:16:32,365
And all your ideas.

655
01:16:32,571 --> 01:16:35,404
Look here, wanker! You've caused
enough trouble here today!

656
01:16:35,607 --> 01:16:39,099
You want more? You want some more
shit beaten out of you, is that it?

657
01:16:39,311 --> 01:16:41,871
I want my fucking I.D.! And now!

658
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,980
Because my patience is all
fucked out. So, let 's get going.

659
01:16:46,518 --> 01:16:50,784
My friend, let 's solve this problem,
with a little intelligence, all right?

660
01:16:51,223 --> 01:16:54,659
Intelligence, huh? When a man
has run out of words,

661
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,851
he always turns to diplomacy.

662
01:17:03,735 --> 01:17:06,795
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti, amen.

663
01:17:07,472 --> 01:17:10,635
Ave Maria, gratia plena,
Dominus tecum:

664
01:17:10,842 --> 01:17:14,175
Benedicta tu in mulieribus et

665
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:17,871
benedictus fructus ventris tui Jesu.

666
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:20,051
Amen.

667
01:17:20,652 --> 01:17:27,319
May the light of God shine upon us,

668
01:17:34,633 --> 01:17:41,129
illuminating our souls

669
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:48,007
with love, the love of Jesus.

670
01:17:48,613 --> 01:17:54,313
The love, the love of Jesus.

671
01:17:55,987 --> 01:18:01,482
We will be your grateful servants.

672
01:18:02,227 --> 01:18:08,894
The supreme peace of the redeemer,

673
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:15,896
fill the non-believers,

674
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:22,775
that go against the Lord with faith.

675
01:18:23,348 --> 01:18:29,719
Our faith is in thee, O Virgin,

676
01:18:29,921 --> 01:18:34,984
and we will be blessed.

677
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:42,461
We ask forGod, our King.

678
01:18:43,502 --> 01:18:50,169
We ask forGod, our Father.

679
01:18:51,076 --> 01:18:57,743
We ask forGod, our King.

680
01:18:59,017 --> 01:19:05,684
We ask forGod, our Father.

681
01:19:23,675 --> 01:19:24,539
Amen.

682
01:19:25,577 --> 01:19:28,671
Well, Bianor is gone. Poor thing.

683
01:19:29,314 --> 01:19:31,680
What a good thing he didn't suffer.

684
01:19:33,251 --> 01:19:37,620
Mr. Bianor died as he was born.

685
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:40,317
Totally anonymous.

686
01:19:41,293 --> 01:19:43,193
Yes. I just think about
one thing, Father.

687
01:19:43,395 --> 01:19:45,420
What on earth
is going to happen to this dump?

688
01:19:45,664 --> 01:19:49,293
Who's going to look after it?
You? Where are you going to eat?

689
01:19:49,501 --> 01:19:51,366
And me? Where am I going to work?

690
01:19:51,570 --> 01:19:54,471
That is not a problem, my son,
because everything in life...

691
01:19:54,673 --> 01:19:59,337
has it 's own time. Look, God made
life with all its mysteries

692
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:01,944
for us to decipher.

693
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:07,547
If you look carefully,
Bianor's death is a sign.

694
01:20:08,153 --> 01:20:11,350
A sign of the changes
that we all need.

695
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:17,287
If not, it means nothing at all,
which is more probable.

696
01:20:17,496 --> 01:20:19,396
Oh for God's sake!
You're going mad.

697
01:20:19,598 --> 01:20:21,828
I don't understand a word
you're talking about.

698
01:20:22,033 --> 01:20:26,367
Dunga, where does your family live?

699
01:20:26,938 --> 01:20:29,372
Why are you so curious?

700
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:33,971
No, it 's just that the family is
the greatest mystery my son.

701
01:20:34,179 --> 01:20:36,147
And yours? Where is yours?

702
01:20:36,348 --> 01:20:38,976
I lost all contact with them.
I became a priest, didn't I?

703
01:20:39,184 --> 01:20:41,414
- I took the vows...
- Don't come on with this 'mass'.

704
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:43,850
I know very well the church
where you pray!

705
01:20:44,055 --> 01:20:45,613
I'm fed up with all these crazy
people. It seems like I'm

706
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:50,693
...the only sane one around here!
- And you are! Yes, you are!

707
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:58,362
Father, do you think we're capable
of doing everything for love?

708
01:20:58,570 --> 01:21:05,203
Yes. Nothing can go wrong when
we love. Love is above everything.

709
01:21:05,844 --> 01:21:08,142
Even killing?

710
01:21:08,346 --> 01:21:13,113
I avoid thinking about killing...
but, it 's not all together a bad idea.

711
01:21:13,552 --> 01:21:16,578
You just don't exist, father.

712
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:19,780
My goodness,
what a comic priest you are!

713
01:21:53,959 --> 01:21:55,824
What is it?

714
01:21:56,027 --> 01:21:58,359
Get in...

715
01:22:11,109 --> 01:22:14,704
this stain on your clothes?
Is it blood?

716
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:19,543
I ripped off the ear of my
husband's lover.

717
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:36,899
I was a dead woman inside.

718
01:22:49,547 --> 01:22:53,210
I'm sorry Bianor, but I just
can't go downstairs.

719
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:57,950
There are times when I think that
I'm the only one in the world,

720
01:22:58,189 --> 01:23:00,521
and that I shall never die.

721
01:23:05,630 --> 01:23:08,656
But I'm not going to sit looking
at a dead body.

722
01:23:10,435 --> 01:23:13,336
Even if it 's Bianor.

723
01:23:19,044 --> 01:23:22,775
But Bianor was good, and I'm not.

724
01:23:24,115 --> 01:23:26,606
These days I'm a little better.

725
01:23:26,951 --> 01:23:29,249
But I used to be bad.

726
01:23:30,155 --> 01:23:34,319
But, I'm not that good...

727
01:23:37,796 --> 01:23:40,458
I'm not.

728
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:54,242
Sometimes I think...

729
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:58,041
that this world is full
of living ghosts.

730
01:27:01,065 --> 01:27:05,092
I'm coming. I'm coming.

731
01:27:12,777 --> 01:27:18,215
Wellington? My God!
What the fuck has happened to you?

732
01:27:18,416 --> 01:27:22,409
It 's Kika, Dunga...
Kika caught me with Daisy.

733
01:27:22,887 --> 01:27:24,980
She made a right scene, Dunga.

734
01:27:25,757 --> 01:27:28,453
Come in, come here.
Sit down, sit down here.

735
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:33,422
Come on, tell me about it.

736
01:27:33,631 --> 01:27:36,225
Kika ate Daisy's ear, Dunga.

737
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:42,303
She used me to get me
away from her.

738
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:48,403
And... and it was Daisy's ear.
Where is Daisy?

739
01:27:48,613 --> 01:27:52,777
I left her at the hospital.
Fucking cow!

740
01:27:53,584 --> 01:27:58,214
Kika, Dunga... Kika disappeared.

741
01:28:00,491 --> 01:28:02,152
I'm fucked off with Daisy.

742
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:06,319
Really fucked off, Dunga.
She made me leave the little thing.

743
01:28:10,735 --> 01:28:15,263
And Kika, she's not home.

744
01:28:25,450 --> 01:28:30,114
Oh... oh... no, no, no,

745
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:36,223
I want Kika.

746
01:28:36,427 --> 01:28:39,954
No, don't cry.

747
01:28:44,102 --> 01:28:46,366
Don't cry.

748
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:48,664
Come on, come to my room, come.

749
01:28:48,873 --> 01:28:52,775
I'll get you some sugared water,
to relax. Come on.

750
01:28:52,977 --> 01:28:56,504
Wellington, come on!

751
01:28:57,782 --> 01:28:59,750
Oh no! My God...

752
01:29:00,885 --> 01:29:03,877
no, look. It 's there.

753
01:29:05,556 --> 01:29:06,454
What 's this Dunga?

754
01:29:06,657 --> 01:29:09,990
Bianor. He went and died on us.
But don't worry about that.

755
01:29:10,194 --> 01:29:12,685
Come on, the bedroom is over here.

756
01:29:12,897 --> 01:29:16,128
Get fucked! I am not sleeping
with a fucking dead body!

757
01:29:16,334 --> 01:29:19,531
The dead don't bite or kill!
Come on, man!

758
01:29:19,737 --> 01:29:22,228
- For fuck's sake, Dunga!
- Come with me!

759
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:25,204
Just be fucking careful, all right?

760
01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:32,274
For fuck's sake! Don't be so
fucking soft? You silly shit!

761
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:42,726
You see, Bianor? You see?

762
01:29:42,927 --> 01:29:47,296
What a day to go and die on?
Shit!

763
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:50,239
Inside, I used to be a dead woman...

764
01:33:47,772 --> 01:33:52,334
There are times when lwonder
about the way things happen.

765
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,174
First, comes the day.

766
01:33:58,382 --> 01:34:02,250
Then, everything happens on that day.

767
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:07,889
Then comes the night-the best part!

768
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:13,356
But then right after that,
comes the day again!

769
01:34:13,564 --> 01:34:18,501
And on and on and on...
never-ending!

770
01:36:21,358 --> 01:36:23,121
Hello, love. What 're we going
to do with your hair?

771
01:36:23,327 --> 01:36:25,522
Cut it and then dye it.

772
01:36:25,729 --> 01:36:30,166
- Like this, just taking off the tips...
- No! Pull it all out and dye it.

773
01:36:30,701 --> 01:36:33,033
And what colour are
we going to dye it?

774
01:36:33,237 --> 01:36:36,229
Something yellowish.

775
01:36:36,674 --> 01:36:42,044
- Something rusty, like clay. Is that it?
- No! No! Something like mango.

776
01:36:43,047 --> 01:36:45,413
A mango yellow.

777
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:53,000
