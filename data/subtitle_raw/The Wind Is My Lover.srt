3
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:53,398
A long time ago,almost in the time 
of the fairy tales,there was a castle

4
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:56,116
which had for centuries 
belonged to the family Månesköld

5
00:01:57,317 --> 00:02:00,000
It was said there was 
a curse over the castle

6
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,291
Reverend Father, I have to speak with you.

7
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:52,661
Yes,I understand

8
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:54,651
The evil has returned and 
possessed Sir Erland.

9
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:57,105
-Yes
-I already knew that

10
00:05:57,917 --> 00:05:59,315
It was written in the stars

11
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,821
But when will this curse cease?

12
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:06,790
It's not a curse, but all
according to the planets

13
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,336
- Saturn...
- Saturn?

14
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,798
Exactly, Saturn.
-But Reverend Father

15
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,210
It can't depend on Saturn?

16
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,451
All in the family of Månesköld is under 
this curse and must die young.

17
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,407
It is the punishment for the first member 
of the family of the Månesköld

18
00:06:24,407 --> 00:06:26,136
for all the crimes of Sir Knuth

19
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,492
Pure superstition, Erasmus.

20
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:31,376
Instead everything is settled 
by the Stellar Constellation

21
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,633
You see, Sir Erland's fate was to be 
born under the sign of Scorpio

22
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,654
With the Saturn in the 8th
house, the house of death

23
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,937
We are meeting again, Sir Erland

24
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,004
Poor creature! You were probably 
born under the sign of Cancer

25
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,910
Yes, yes, stay here and
I'll try to chase him to you

26
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,820
Käck! Grip!(dog names) Come on!

27
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,145
Käck! Grip!

28
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,724
I am not scared of you!

29
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,878
You are beautiful.

30
00:09:03,707 --> 00:09:05,103
What's your name?

31
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,857
You're not from the neighbourhood

32
00:09:09,857 --> 00:09:11,347
How clever you are.

33
00:09:11,857 --> 00:09:13,388
Where are you from?

34
00:09:14,244 --> 00:09:15,303
From nowhere.

35
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,883
And from everywhere,
if you need to know

36
00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:19,483
Don't you know whom you are addressing?

37
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,991
I'm Sir Erland. And this whole
area belongs to me.

38
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,114
That's not much.I would choke in your place

39
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,649
The whole world is owned by me.

40
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:48,718
Do you like the colour?

41
00:09:49,785 --> 00:09:51,559
It's the colour of the blood.

42
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:54,933
My name is Singoalla

43
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,641
No

44
00:10:37,174 --> 00:10:39,830
We were just discussing 
your son, your Grace.

45
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,512
The stars say that Sir Erland can
be free from the curse of the moon

46
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:48,600
only through a Blessed marriage

47
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:55,160
Seven generations have already served
God with humility and piousness

48
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,000
If Sir Erland will join them

49
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,397
there might be no further
Divine Judgement

50
00:11:02,091 --> 00:11:05,292
It is not just the question of the evil
possessing Sir Erland, Revered Father

51
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:07,413
It is also about the name of the Månesköld

52
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:11,316
Remember, Bengt, my husband,
died at the age of 25

53
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,984
Hugo, Erland's grandfather, 
at the age of 23.

54
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,655
And Sigurd, Erland's great
grandfather, was 26 years old.

55
00:11:21,226 --> 00:11:25,914
If Erland would now pass away,
the Månesköld family would be extinguished

56
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,195
Therefore, I have decided to marry him
with Sir Gudmund Ulvsax's daughter

57
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,317
The sad thing is that just the word
marriage makes Erland ready for.....

58
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,742
How strange

59
00:11:43,255 --> 00:11:46,142
Usually Erland gets so depressed
 when the darkness falls

60
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,592
-What do you think of?
- Me? Nothing,My Lord

61
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,698
Well... yes, keep on.

62
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,439
What a lovely evening!

63
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,634
One such a night, the stars can only 
bring luck,I suppose, Reverend Father

64
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:08,682
No, Mr. Erland, tonight the stars
have told us something extraordinary

65
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,784
They bode a great event. 
A blissful happiness

66
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,657
- Really?
-A meeting

67
00:12:16,923 --> 00:12:18,184
A meeting?

68
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,553
With a young girl.

69
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:25,031
That's unbelievable!

70
00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:26,056
Why?

71
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:30,102
Unbelievable!

72
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,027
And this young girl...

73
00:12:34,644 --> 00:12:35,885
Will she love me?

74
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,687
Passionately.

75
00:12:38,502 --> 00:12:41,550
I know that the idea of marriage 
doesn't appeal to you very much, your..

76
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,759
- Who put those thoughts in your mind?
- I got that impression.

77
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,215
Everything has changed, Reverend Father

78
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,751
Singoalla!

79
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,464
Singoalla!

80
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,377
Singoalla!

81
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:47,186
Yes!

82
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:51,184
Sir Erland

83
00:15:53,112 --> 00:15:54,552
Maybe I'm just an old fool.

84
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,239
But when you were a child

85
00:15:57,126 --> 00:16:01,039
I was the one who taught you to trace
wild boar, elk and wolf

86
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,421
And to mimic the sounds of the birds

87
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,517
It was me, who made your first
bow and your first arrow.

88
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,130
Yes, I almost lost my eye because of that

89
00:16:13,618 --> 00:16:16,580
So, perhaps, you may forgive me if I ..

90
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,580
Let me be!

91
00:16:27,573 --> 00:16:29,209
She will never return.

92
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:32,190
It's just as you met
her in your dreams

93
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,636
As if she had never existed

94
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:36,409
I know she will come back.

95
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,589
She is beautiful,
Maiden Helena Ulvsax

96
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,396
Yes, yes, I would love to
marry her in your place.

97
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,848
And do you a favour

98
00:16:50,868 --> 00:16:52,782
Yes, naturally,in case she wants me

99
00:16:54,535 --> 00:16:56,060
But she probably doesn't want to

100
00:16:56,688 --> 00:16:57,762
Fool

101
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,116
Erland, why are you not coming down
and welcome your chosen one?

102
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,125
It's a good match

103
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:07,645
She is very beautiful. And
of course, very virtuous

104
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,472
And chaste. Even in
her dreams, isn't she?

105
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,730
And her father is a rich and powerful Earl

106
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,584
What else could be missing for to be happy?

107
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,084
Nothing! Except the true happiness.

108
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:22,216
I'm not in love with Helena.

109
00:17:22,216 --> 00:17:24,419
So, you're asking for love too?

110
00:17:24,649 --> 00:17:26,687
Remember that you belong 
to the family Månesköld.

111
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:28,058
And that you are not Master 
of your Own Destiny

112
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:30,395
The only thing that matters is 
the future of our family

113
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:31,977
Come on, let us go

114
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:34,621
Listen to me, my son

115
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,749
When your dad got married,
he did not love me.

116
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:39,888
We had to learn to be happy

117
00:17:40,718 --> 00:17:42,265
Without happiness.

118
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:43,934
Is that possible?

119
00:17:45,785 --> 00:17:46,922
I don't know.

120
00:17:48,242 --> 00:17:49,465
It was for such a short time.

121
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:34,902
Our children seem to be a great
match, Sir Gudmund

122
00:18:35,846 --> 00:18:38,237
Our possessions would expand

123
00:18:38,238 --> 00:18:40,931
Ulvsax and Månesköld coming together
that'll be stupendous

124
00:18:43,316 --> 00:18:45,467
You know of the plan's of our parents?

125
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:49,124
They would like us to be engaged

126
00:18:54,215 --> 00:18:57,274
Your future spouse must be the
 most happy man in the world

127
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:00,708
You are very beautiful.

128
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:04,454
Your eyes are tender, like an angel

129
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,101
But the black colour,isn't that 
too grim for your age?

130
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:11,058
The black colour?

131
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:13,017
Yes, the widow's veil

132
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:15,950
Look at them, all three of them

133
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:24,441
Has no one told you about the curse of the 
of the Månesköld family?

134
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:27,332
You become widow quite soon here

135
00:19:28,325 --> 00:19:31,066
But you would become an charming widow

136
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,534
Erland

137
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,200
Why are you always having 
such cruel thoughts?

138
00:19:37,782 --> 00:19:39,572
The horror, Helena.

139
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,300
The horror possess this castle.

140
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,154
Can't I help you?I am not afraid.

141
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,239
The making of the cross of a young 
girl would deter the Devil

142
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,876
Would not the curse,then be vanished by

143
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,442
The love

144
00:21:10,129 --> 00:21:15,560
Your Highness., we are some poor 
travellers who appeal to your mercy

145
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:23,167
Behold, in these hands you can 
see the chalice of bitter suffering

146
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,490
Your faces and your manners don't 
appeal to me.What do you want?

147
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,749
We ask if you could allow us

148
00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:31,899
poor travellers, to rise our tents  
for a few days in your forests

149
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,389
-We have heard a lot of your kindness
- Really?

150
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,893
And I've heard a lot 
about you and your pack

151
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:39,952
nothing but liars,thieves and sorcerers.

152
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,250
-Get out of here 
- Mother!

153
00:21:42,287 --> 00:21:43,293
What!

154
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:45,460
You allow wild boars to roam 
around your forests

155
00:21:45,736 --> 00:21:47,716
But you refuse old women 
and children to camp there

156
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,208
Yes, the wild boar would be
salted and smoked by someone

157
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,751
but these beasts are unfit 
for human consumption

158
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:54,727
They are like wolves!

159
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:56,145
I understand your anger, Your Highness

160
00:21:56,877 --> 00:21:59,890
But be careful, you must yield
 to Erland's whims

161
00:22:00,981 --> 00:22:03,994
And the Heaven will let 
your wishes be fulfilled

162
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,368
Let it be. Allow the strangers to stay

163
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,361
God Bless you for this great kindness

164
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,884
We'll never forget it

165
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,107
Look here, which month were you born?

166
00:22:27,602 --> 00:22:29,862
Yes, that's long time ago,
I can't remember ..

167
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,608
I think February 23rd

168
00:22:32,608 --> 00:22:36,528
23rd of February ? Pisces?
Mercury in the second quarter.

169
00:22:37,358 --> 00:22:40,709
Mercury. That's the patron of the thieves

170
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,867
Thieves?

171
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:46,821
Can't be possible! I must have 
mistaken the date,Your Reverend

172
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:55,500
Look at her! She is the most beautiful

173
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,320
-Beautiful in the moon light, huh?
-Yes

174
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,720
And are you looking at them?

175
00:24:10,422 --> 00:24:12,807
You wanted to kill me the 
first time you saw me

176
00:24:27,103 --> 00:24:30,286
Yes... it's just me.

177
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,797
I noticed you didn't want to be aware of me

178
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,771
Last spring we said we
were to marry this winter

179
00:24:37,135 --> 00:24:39,956
And when the winter came, 
you said this spring

180
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:42,613
And now?

181
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,919
Singoalla!

182
00:24:45,754 --> 00:24:47,449
There is no one else you love?

183
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,796
If you do that..

184
00:26:02,106 --> 00:26:04,035
You have just arrived

185
00:26:05,157 --> 00:26:07,710
I always knew you
were coming to me.

186
00:26:09,813 --> 00:26:11,892
I saw you constantly before me

187
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:14,541
wandering on the roads

188
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:18,019
I really wondered what it could be

189
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,658
Lived in a sort

190
00:26:21,237 --> 00:26:24,907
a nightmare, as in a shadow world.

191
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,718
Even the sun became a shadow
and there was no day anymore.

192
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,165
There has been no day for me too

193
00:26:34,305 --> 00:26:37,269
but a dim joyless light

194
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,171
-Damned ugly 
-That never ended

195
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:47,072
When I saw the snow falling, I
thought you might freeze

196
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,396
And when the cold wind touched my lips

197
00:26:51,173 --> 00:26:53,660
I imagined your mouth had gone cold

198
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:57,642
When the pale winter light swept your hands

199
00:26:58,831 --> 00:27:00,297
I wanted to cry.

200
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,132
When the ice started melting on the lake

201
00:27:05,714 --> 00:27:08,061
I knew you were not far away

202
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,000
The first flowers told me
you were on your way

203
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:17,254
and the birds song that you were coming,
God bless the spring!

204
00:27:25,509 --> 00:27:28,429
It's getting dark, my love

205
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,468
Soon I will not have you anymore.

206
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,348
Why?

207
00:27:35,895 --> 00:27:37,716
I'm just a traveller.

208
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,555
And you...

209
00:27:40,503 --> 00:27:42,255
You are powerful and rich.

210
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,192
You own all this land

211
00:27:46,162 --> 00:27:48,038
And you love me.

212
00:27:49,554 --> 00:27:50,766
If this is a dream

213
00:27:51,811 --> 00:27:54,515
never let me wake up

214
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,282
Do you remember

215
00:27:56,282 --> 00:27:59,282
when you told me you
owned the whole world?

216
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:04,276
Now, now I own immensely more

217
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,314
We must be born under
the same star.

218
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,383
Don't talk about the stars.

219
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,247
Why not?

220
00:28:17,014 --> 00:28:20,678
Because Saturn doesn't like me

221
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,669
Do not do that. It's witchcraft

222
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:25,847
Are you superstitious?

223
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,605
Don't laugh, don't
trifle with witchcraft

224
00:28:30,847 --> 00:28:34,238
See, that sign means sadness.

225
00:28:35,335 --> 00:28:38,245
And this means joy.

226
00:28:43,476 --> 00:28:45,410
Last night, you danced with a young girl

227
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,786
She was very beautiful

228
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:51,138
Are you jealous?

229
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:53,068
My jealousy is boundless

230
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:57,465
My mother wants me
to marry that girl.

231
00:28:58,065 --> 00:28:59,328
But I don't want to

232
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,813
My father also wants to marry me

233
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,954
Do you want that?

234
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,103
Do you hear the song?

235
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:13,014
I have to go now

236
00:29:23,224 --> 00:29:25,153
Singoalla is not here. Have you seen her?

237
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,637
- What, what is it?
-It's dark.

238
00:29:36,658 --> 00:29:37,735
What can I do about that?

239
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,446
Your daughter has been away from 
the camp since late this morning

240
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:41,852
and she has not yet come back

241
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,115
-Isn't that strange?
-Don't bother about it

242
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:50,037
Bother?So I should not ,although
my own son is to marry her

243
00:29:55,682 --> 00:29:57,244
You old owl

244
00:29:58,051 --> 00:29:59,902
Singoalla hasn't come back yet

245
00:30:04,086 --> 00:30:05,824
She left the camp early this morning

246
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,754
and have not come back yet,
strange isn't it? Huh?

247
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,421
By all means, if that's 
how you feel about it.

248
00:30:12,421 --> 00:30:14,136
It's not me who is going to marry her

249
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,219
I trust her. And I can't stand you and
the others going around gossiping.

250
00:30:17,978 --> 00:30:19,090
Have you understood?

251
00:30:19,253 --> 00:30:20,316
Aha, yes

252
00:30:20,643 --> 00:30:22,888
And you didn't notice anything
yesterday at the castle ?

253
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:29,841
She and the young knight,their eyes were 
captivating each other,you fool

254
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,232
Assim

255
00:30:38,518 --> 00:30:39,930
Come on!

256
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:44,125
Listen!

257
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:48,579
There is gold and silver and other precious
 things in the chapel at the castle.

258
00:30:49,162 --> 00:30:52,633
We should make a small farewell 
visit before we move on

259
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:55,423
-Yes 
-And then?

260
00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:57,329
We disappear

261
00:31:10,093 --> 00:31:11,984
You will be my wife

262
00:31:14,764 --> 00:31:16,717
Your wife.

263
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:24,639
Assim!

264
00:32:23,281 --> 00:32:25,577
No, Erland! Save him!

265
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,804
And you, you

266
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:59,905
are you sure you can leave all this?

267
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:01,503
Are you not going to long back?

268
00:33:03,012 --> 00:33:04,954
To my wonderful castle?

269
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:10,474
It's the castle of sorrows,
owls and the black veils

270
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,559
where the wind is shrieking and crying

271
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,186
Oh, and to leave all this to
live with you travelling around

272
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,922
Where the wind just sings!

273
00:33:20,104 --> 00:33:21,823
You are the one who will deliver me

274
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,966
Oh my love...

275
00:33:24,281 --> 00:33:27,881
You will only exist in my 
heart until the face of death

276
00:33:36,498 --> 00:33:40,474
I swear to love Erland until my
death and to be faithful to him

277
00:33:41,363 --> 00:33:43,330
If I betray him, he is entitled to kill me

278
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,605
And the great God shall shut the gates
of paradise for my lost soul.

279
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:56,406
Now it's your turn to swear above
Aloko's stone, the God of our tribe

280
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:03,440
I swear to love Singoalla until my
death and to be faithful to her

281
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,957
If I betray her, she
is entitled to kill me

282
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:12,678
And the great God shall shut the gates
of paradise for my lost soul.

283
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:45,835
Now you are my Lord

284
00:34:46,968 --> 00:34:48,502
and I'm your slave

285
00:34:50,077 --> 00:34:51,340
No...

286
00:35:01,121 --> 00:35:03,253
My Ruler

287
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:40,914
Sir Erland, that's not possible

288
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,393
-There's no Sir Erland anymore 
-But that's madness

289
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,519
-Yes, I'm insane. Insane by happiness, 
-If I only dare to..

290
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,077
You had already done what
you could to convince me

291
00:35:51,078 --> 00:35:54,001
Before I disappear forever, I just want
to say farewell to you, old friend

292
00:35:54,561 --> 00:35:55,930
Keep the secret to yourself

293
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:58,210
But wait at least until tomorrow

294
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,038
You know that this night is holy.

295
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:07,330
The whole castle, the chapel even
my workshop, everything is in mourning.

296
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,260
And as always, the monks are in
 deep prayer until dawn

297
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,684
for God to have mercy of the 
soul of Knuth,your sinful ancestor.

298
00:36:16,393 --> 00:36:17,800
-Good Bye, Erasmus.
-You can't..

299
00:36:18,244 --> 00:36:19,777
You can't leave us

300
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,932
But you!

301
00:36:26,077 --> 00:36:27,636
Can't you do anything!

302
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:33,115
Prevent him! Perform a miracle!

303
00:36:35,142 --> 00:36:36,862
Can't be that difficult for you!

304
00:36:37,634 --> 00:36:40,479
You are so powerful! And so plentiful !!

305
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,588
Let him understand that
he can not leave us.

306
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:44,976
Put that thing down.

307
00:37:45,954 --> 00:37:48,997
And you stay here by the wagon
but keep your eyes open!

308
00:37:55,297 --> 00:37:57,431
She is waiting for Erland to come.

309
00:37:57,857 --> 00:38:01,193
What an honour for the leader
and have a knight as a son-in- law

310
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:03,374
I should think so.

311
00:38:03,437 --> 00:38:05,981
You do not mean we should wait for him?

312
00:38:05,997 --> 00:38:07,651
Well, if he's so keen to be my son-in-law

313
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:10,313
he may come running after us
Don't worry old witch

314
00:38:11,987 --> 00:38:14,563
Come along!

315
00:38:24,452 --> 00:38:27,270
Father! Erland hasn't come yet.

316
00:38:27,874 --> 00:38:28,949
Start moving!

317
00:38:29,798 --> 00:38:34,733
But why are you driving so fast. 
We have to wait for Erland.

318
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,907
We would have to wait ages for him. 
Your knight has made fun of you.

319
00:38:38,907 --> 00:38:40,255
Start!

320
00:38:46,948 --> 00:38:49,564
Wait!
You have to wait!

321
00:38:51,951 --> 00:38:53,012
You have to wait!

322
00:39:00,018 --> 00:39:01,315
Erland!

323
00:40:16,921 --> 00:40:20,586
Get up in the cart for a
while, you are exhausted.

324
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,263
Now be wise and obey me

325
00:40:25,036 --> 00:40:26,176
Obey?

326
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:29,766
You are speaking as we've been
married for a hundred years.

327
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,219
With you I could go to
the end of the world

328
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,098
It's not the men's fault, but
the horses can't take it anymore

329
00:40:45,173 --> 00:40:46,364
Should not we stop for a while?

330
00:40:47,191 --> 00:40:50,244
- There is no danger anymore.
-We must go on, continue

331
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,596
We are far from Månesköld's grounds

332
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,811
And the drink is ready.

333
00:40:59,172 --> 00:41:00,631
Now we are far from your castle.

334
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,467
My castle? You mean my prison.

335
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,843
Well, .. do you enjoy our new life?

336
00:41:07,994 --> 00:41:09,346
Share it with your husband

337
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:13,341
You are a bad coach. Keep the rains

338
00:41:15,919 --> 00:41:17,351
The chap will get his drink

339
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,661
- Drink.
-No, you must drink first

340
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,215
I never drink wine.

341
00:42:29,436 --> 00:42:30,619
Erland are you sick?

342
00:42:31,585 --> 00:42:32,636
I do not know.

343
00:42:33,261 --> 00:42:34,464
There is something with the eyes.
.

344
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,188
It's like I saw through a veil

345
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,557
You're really hot

346
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:41,159
It's nothing dangerous, 
I'll be fine soon enough

347
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,711
It burns here. My head...

348
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,211
My God, my God

349
00:43:02,773 --> 00:43:04,711
Riders, there are riders who pursue us

350
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:12,154
Quick, take wagon up the hill!
 Hurry! Hurry!

351
00:43:23,723 --> 00:43:25,027
You gave me a drink!

352
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,545
Erland!

353
00:44:30,482 --> 00:44:32,514
No, let me go!

354
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,002
Take the coffin in the wagon
 and hide the treasure. Fast!

355
00:46:02,624 --> 00:46:06,327
- We're losing!
-No, idiot! We have hostage.

356
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,911
Stop!

357
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,534
- Erland!
-It's your son's life against our lives

358
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,758
Villain

359
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,517
Swear that you give us 
free passage, otherwise...

360
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,317
You have stolen the treasure
 of the Månesköld

361
00:46:34,317 --> 00:46:35,317
It's here now

362
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,638
- Never!
- No!

363
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:42,296
-Your Highness..
-Watch it! Who advised me?

364
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:45,469
Do you dare to appreciate some gold
things more than my son's life?

365
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:47,423
It'll be the way you want.

366
00:46:49,392 --> 00:46:51,444
We have just given him a sleeping drink

367
00:47:08,081 --> 00:47:10,859
They will receive a nice gift, 
he will die soon

368
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,843
The treasure? Where is it?

369
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,121
Where is it? Where has it gone?

370
00:47:40,787 --> 00:47:41,914
It's gone

371
00:47:43,759 --> 00:47:44,957
They have deceived us.

372
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,136
They have run away with the treasure.

373
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,147
Harlot!

374
00:48:07,782 --> 00:48:11,821
You've dishonoured me!
You have dishonoured our whole tribe.

375
00:48:14,419 --> 00:48:20,333
You have dishonoured, Alako, our God!
Your place is no longer among us!

376
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:23,855
I prefer to live among wolves
and snakes rather than with you

377
00:48:25,438 --> 00:48:29,505
I loved him.I loved him so much

378
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:34,936
And you have killed him. Cursed be you all!

379
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,677
- Your bitch! Get out!
- No!

380
00:48:38,717 --> 00:48:42,866
She's staying. And if you chase 
her away,I'll be leaving too

381
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,065
Cursed you all!

382
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:10,913
The poison

383
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:22,349
It was she who gave it to me

384
00:49:24,887 --> 00:49:30,327
Ten years later.A terrible plague,which 
have been carried by itinerant gypsies

385
00:49:30,327 --> 00:49:33,127
from the Far East to Europe is approaching

386
00:49:34,136 --> 00:49:38,372
A dark skinned boy is supposed to 
herald the arrival of the plague

387
00:49:51,507 --> 00:49:53,022
The plague is coming.

388
00:49:53,022 --> 00:49:57,222
Nothing can stop it. The sky
is deaf to our prayers.

389
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:02,575
Cover your faces, abandon your villages!
Escape to north!

390
00:50:36,852 --> 00:50:38,430
The plague!

391
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,397
The plague!

392
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:39,303
Sorgbarn (eq.child of sorrow), my dear,
 come and rest for a while.

393
00:51:39,747 --> 00:51:41,389
I'm not tired, mother.

394
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:45,792
That's true, a man is never tired.
Here.

395
00:51:46,631 --> 00:51:48,106
Oh, look mother!

396
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,450
An arrow and a branch. 
Are we going to the left?

397
00:51:53,045 --> 00:51:54,129
No, to the right.

398
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,083
But is that not a halting place?

399
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:59,179
 Yes, just that. Look, they 
are stopping here.

400
00:52:11,549 --> 00:52:13,686
Make way for the knight!

401
00:52:14,528 --> 00:52:16,067
Mr. Knight

402
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,547
You are cowards! Cowards!

403
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:44,421
Don't cry, they are not worth it.

404
00:52:44,421 --> 00:52:47,313
They are mean and envious because
you are of blue blood.

405
00:52:48,257 --> 00:52:49,988
If you knew how beautiful your father was

406
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:54,250
There has never been a more 
beautiful man than him

407
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:58,465
-And he had a wonderful castle, mother.
-The most wonderful of all castles.

408
00:53:06,655 --> 00:53:11,614
And never have a man loved
a woman the way he loved me.

409
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,899
Our tribe hates his kin.

410
00:53:16,627 --> 00:53:18,905
Therefore, they tear me away from
your father and killed him

411
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:22,798
And he was even stronger and 
braver than they were?

412
00:53:22,798 --> 00:53:25,106
They killed him cowardly with poison

413
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:31,358
When I grow up, I'll be strong like father.
I'll defend you.

414
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,841
Tell me about the treasure, mother, about
everything they stole from him.

415
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,418
God punished them,they lost it.

416
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,147
And nobody knows where it is?

417
00:53:44,837 --> 00:53:46,167
No...

418
00:53:50,423 --> 00:53:51,982
You're sleepy, my dear

419
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:56,659
I often dream that I
find the treasure.

420
00:53:58,405 --> 00:54:03,137
It shines. There is a big find of gold

421
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:05,291
With rubies around the wrist.

422
00:54:06,486 --> 00:54:10,111
Yes, and a crown, also of gold

423
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,484
With emeralds and diamonds.

424
00:54:13,495 --> 00:54:16,786
Like small pieces of the sun

425
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,308
You sleep my dear

426
00:54:20,836 --> 00:54:25,266
You'll see, I'll probably find the treasure

427
00:54:26,479 --> 00:54:28,710
And I'll help you

428
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:55,366
You,now again

429
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,088
Can you imagine if they had seen you go in?

430
00:55:03,877 --> 00:55:05,890
Imagine if they saw you 
sitting and talking to me

431
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,080
You would be despised too

432
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,546
Your own mother would deny you

433
00:55:14,765 --> 00:55:15,941
Why are you coming here?

434
00:55:17,257 --> 00:55:19,236
Why can't you leave me alone?

435
00:55:24,402 --> 00:55:26,026
Poor Assim.

436
00:55:27,976 --> 00:55:30,187
Sometimes I almost feel sorry for you

437
00:55:30,777 --> 00:55:34,958
I just wanted to ask if you needed 
something.You or the boy.

438
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,431
What would I need?

439
00:55:38,732 --> 00:55:41,346
Poison maybe? Or abuse

440
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,511
Or a whiplash in the face.

441
00:55:44,446 --> 00:55:46,603
That's all I've got from Alako's people.

442
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,673
-How you hate us.
-And for everyday I hate you more

443
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:55,053
The moment will come when the 
punishment will strike your heads

444
00:55:56,045 --> 00:55:59,522
And I pray to heaven that 
I will see that day

445
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:05,511
I will follow you like the revenge 
goddess on invisible wings.

446
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:10,966
And they want to drag me down
with you, your own curse

447
00:56:57,016 --> 00:56:58,416
The plague

448
00:56:58,897 --> 00:56:59,951
The plague

449
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,235
It's the vengeance over us

450
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,355
Mother?

451
00:58:43,334 --> 00:58:47,240
-What does this mean?
-It means castle

452
00:59:02,517 --> 00:59:04,619
I like you so much,mother.

453
01:00:24,402 --> 01:00:25,692
Look!

454
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,040
Gracious God, it must
be the plague boy!

455
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,650
The plague is coming,wherever 
he shows his face

456
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:51,192
We are lost.

457
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,510
The plague boy!

458
01:01:53,893 --> 01:01:55,253
Father! Father!

459
01:02:13,215 --> 01:02:15,668
- The plague boy.
- Erasmus!

460
01:02:16,928 --> 01:02:19,337
It's just a poor child.

461
01:02:19,415 --> 01:02:20,724
But he spreads death himself

462
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,254
Come here, dear friend. Come here and
tell Sir Erland and us all who you are.

463
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,450
Sir Erland?

464
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,937
Why are you staring at me like that?

465
01:02:44,864 --> 01:02:46,855
It's strange. I don't know this boy.

466
01:02:48,233 --> 01:02:51,969
And yet it's as if he
reminds me of someone.

467
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,710
-I'm Sorgbarn and my mother. -What
something -You are hurting me!

468
01:02:55,740 --> 01:03:01,972
You're a gypsy... Gypsy...
And you dare...

469
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:05,055
Get out of here. Ge out of here!

470
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,453
Erland, how can you?

471
01:03:11,576 --> 01:03:12,913
And you're asking that

472
01:03:17,412 --> 01:03:20,252
Should I forget the poison that
brought me near to death?

473
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,575
And buried my mother,as if 
she had been drinking it too?

474
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,673
Should I forget the endless
hours you spent at my bed?

475
01:03:30,999 --> 01:03:33,057
Your anxiety?Your despair?

476
01:03:33,937 --> 01:03:37,382
Which made me insane when
I was lying there paralysed

477
01:03:39,364 --> 01:03:43,126
Should I forget those dirty hands of the 
thieves who groped over my treasure?

478
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,736
And got away with it

479
01:03:46,567 --> 01:03:52,182
She... she the most mean of all

480
01:03:53,779 --> 01:03:55,922
... who first bewitched me

481
01:03:57,686 --> 01:03:59,445
and then poisoned me!

482
01:04:00,137 --> 01:04:02,432
If you've forgotten all
this, I haven't!

483
01:04:02,775 --> 01:04:05,978
Erland, I wish I could forget it

484
01:04:06,916 --> 01:04:09,327
but this boy is innocent!

485
01:04:10,535 --> 01:04:14,543
Innocent? Look, look at his eyes!

486
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:17,351
And then talk about innocence!

487
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:20,767
It's the fire of the hell
 that burns in them

488
01:04:29,803 --> 01:04:31,262
Now, you shouldn't cry anymore.

489
01:04:31,605 --> 01:04:32,815
Don't cry

490
01:04:34,695 --> 01:04:38,615
Come with me, tell me, are you Christian?

491
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:42,464
- I don't know, I..
-Can you make the sign of the cross?

492
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:47,647
-Yes, yes, is it not like this?
-That's fine, that's fine

493
01:04:48,047 --> 01:04:50,446
Also, tell me, who are your parents?

494
01:04:51,169 --> 01:04:52,523
I never knew my father.

495
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:54,999
And my mother is very unhappy

496
01:04:54,999 --> 01:04:56,030
Where are you from?

497
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:02,051
I do not know. I left my tribe and I've
been going along nights and days

498
01:05:02,916 --> 01:05:04,282
But why did you leave ?

499
01:05:04,282 --> 01:05:07,167
To look for the treasure
and the beautiful castle

500
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:11,095
-What treasure?
-Yes, and it's wonderful

501
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:15,597
There is a hand of gold with rubies.
And a gold crown with emeralds.

502
01:05:16,577 --> 01:05:19,629
-How can you know ?
-Yes, I've seen them

503
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:22,626
-Have you seen them?
- Yes, in the dream.

504
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:23,835
Was it in a dream?

505
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,912
Yes, there was a voice that called me.

506
01:05:29,206 --> 01:05:31,035
It can't be a pure coincidence.

507
01:05:31,035 --> 01:05:32,732
What do you mean, Reverend father?

508
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:36,791
I don't know, I can't say it yet

509
01:05:39,166 --> 01:05:41,931
But Sir Erland has to keep this boy here

510
01:05:43,525 --> 01:05:46,820
I see it... in his eyes.

511
01:05:59,484 --> 01:06:01,432
Is he away again
that lazy dog?

512
01:06:01,532 --> 01:06:02,943
He is just a child.

513
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,262
He has to learn to obey!

514
01:07:23,417 --> 01:07:24,656
Stop it!

515
01:07:26,156 --> 01:07:27,394
Stop it!

516
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:29,501
What are you looking at?

517
01:07:29,981 --> 01:07:31,986
I'm getting crazy with that cacophony!

518
01:07:33,864 --> 01:07:36,296
He sits staring at me
like a faithful dog.

519
01:07:40,251 --> 01:07:41,599
I can not stand it anymore!

520
01:07:45,954 --> 01:07:52,053
I don't want to see you anymore, you'll
be leaving already tomorrow morning

521
01:08:28,398 --> 01:08:30,102
Maybe I was hard against you, Sorgbarn

522
01:08:30,337 --> 01:08:31,782
But don't worry about it anymore

523
01:08:34,308 --> 01:08:38,110
I said I would chase you away
but you may stay

524
01:08:41,299 --> 01:08:46,356
Now, now, sleep my boy

525
01:08:47,945 --> 01:08:50,791
Now, sleep now

526
01:10:47,195 --> 01:10:49,996
-He's alive!
- My dear!

527
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,629
You can't run away from me like that.

528
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:55,111
I've been so worried

529
01:10:56,292 --> 01:10:58,940
Come on, we can't stay here.

530
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,531
In this country we are all hated.

531
01:11:02,531 --> 01:11:05,584
Don't you understand? I'm saying
 that father is alive

532
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,874
I know.

533
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,210
I also know that he has
married and he has a child

534
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:13,043
You have not talked to 
your father about us?

535
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:17,275
I felt that I wouldn't do that

536
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,651
He hates me, doesn't he?

537
01:11:21,531 --> 01:11:23,899
He thinks it was I who
wanted to kill him that time

538
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:27,483
-How can he believe such a thing like that?
-Don't be sorry, mother

539
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,520
I will bring him to you

540
01:11:30,562 --> 01:11:33,844
and you will tell how it really was

541
01:11:53,692 --> 01:11:56,095
Nobody's coming here, go away

542
01:11:56,449 --> 01:11:57,487
Go away

543
01:11:58,521 --> 01:12:02,520
No one can touch me,
everything is futile

544
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:05,972
I feel that I'll leave you soon.

545
01:12:06,766 --> 01:12:09,817
And this voyage I have to do alone

546
01:12:11,321 --> 01:12:12,383
Assim

547
01:12:12,383 --> 01:12:14,228
You will be my successor.

548
01:12:15,579 --> 01:12:18,365
That is my last command

549
01:12:19,243 --> 01:12:26,625
Everything remains the same,
you will still go on living

550
01:12:27,641 --> 01:12:31,622
With the sky as a tent, 
my wishes to Singoalla

551
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:37,565
and say that she was known 
for the wrong reasons

552
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:41,169
and her father's heart

553
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:50,400
If you were here, I would say

554
01:12:51,762 --> 01:12:53,570
Excuse...

555
01:12:58,686 --> 01:13:00,464
The chief is dead.

556
01:13:05,859 --> 01:13:11,014
Excuse Singoalla? Maybe we should
ask her for forgiveness instead

557
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,921
- Mother!
-Do you know where Singoalla is?

558
01:13:14,444 --> 01:13:15,455
Do you know where she is?

559
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:19,983
She has abandoned her tribe and
gone back to Sir Erland

560
01:13:20,073 --> 01:13:25,290
- Erland?
- Yes. He's alive. Do you hear? He's alive!

561
01:13:26,416 --> 01:13:30,476
And now? What does the new
leader commands us to do?

562
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:35,994
I guess continue our journey. But our 
tribe's honour, what are you doing with it?

563
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,539
And the law of our people, which
punishes betrayal with death

564
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:42,937
When Singoalla betrayed Assim, 
she betrayed us all!

565
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:47,298
Yes, you're a cowardly wretches,
all of you,cowards

566
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:52,171
Mangy dogs! Fie! What are
 you afraid of? To die?

567
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:55,881
What does it help now that 
the plague has caught us?

568
01:13:56,687 --> 01:14:03,314
You there! Look at his cheek, there it
begins. And I, I also have a plague.

569
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,893
And Singoalla

570
01:14:05,893 --> 01:14:11,165
She continues to live happily with
her knight at the beautiful castle

571
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:12,591
Turn around!

572
01:16:32,115 --> 01:16:36,310
My beloved...
It is you!

573
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:39,353
It is you!

574
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:42,837
Let me have a look at you.

575
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:47,929
Singoalla. Where have you been so long?

576
01:16:49,075 --> 01:16:53,514
I have suffered boundlessly
as if you were dead, my love

577
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:57,316
I also wanted to die, to be with you

578
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:07,153
When I saw the snow falling, I
thought you might freeze

579
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:12,719
And when the cold
wind touched my lips

580
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:17,303
I thought maybe your
mouth had become cold.

581
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:23,099
When the ice started melting on the
lake, I knew you were not far away

582
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,335
You can't see me, my love

583
01:17:28,335 --> 01:17:30,135
When the first flowers appeared,

584
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:33,642
it reminded me that you 
were on your way here

585
01:17:35,935 --> 01:17:38,863
and the birds' song that you had come

586
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,894
God bless the spring.

587
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:49,151
You can't see me.
You can't hear me.

588
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:09,071
- But why are you crying?
-I want to die.

589
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,292
If only I could die!

590
01:18:13,244 --> 01:18:14,608
He does not love me anymore.

591
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:17,665
He saw me and he did not look at me.

592
01:18:18,809 --> 01:18:21,048
It was my shadow he spoke to.

593
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:25,816
-That's more grim than death itself 
- Don't cry, mother.

594
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,990
This morning how did he behave?

595
01:18:29,381 --> 01:18:32,089
This morning? As usual.

596
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:38,638
Don't tell fibs.Tell me the truth.

597
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,243
He was dark and gloomy.

598
01:18:41,243 --> 01:18:45,180
And he said he had an evil dream.

599
01:18:51,721 --> 01:18:56,807
That's what I've become for him,
an evil dream

600
01:18:58,091 --> 01:19:01,756
If he would meet me during the
day he would kill me.

601
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:06,507
He's sick, mother.We'll make him healthy.

602
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:11,877
If he just can see the treasure,
then he would understand.

603
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,387
-You are sweet, my dear 
- I think I know where it is

604
01:19:17,992 --> 01:19:20,022
Perhaps in the big cliff?

605
01:19:21,301 --> 01:19:22,395
Yes

606
01:19:22,420 --> 01:19:25,691
Or in the hollow tree,
don't you think so?

607
01:19:26,112 --> 01:19:31,550
Yes, it must be there!

608
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:48,859
- Look, mother!
- Yes my dear.

609
01:21:02,626 --> 01:21:03,937
Night

610
01:21:04,922 --> 01:21:06,032
Night!

611
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,270
Always this black night!

612
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:14,713
- No no!
-What is it, my friend?

613
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:19,153
This dreadful dream.

614
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,480
I don't want to.

615
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:26,955
She mustn't come back.

616
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:32,230
I dreamed that I was at the spring.

617
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:36,877
There she sat waiting for me.

618
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,879
Light! Torches!

619
01:21:46,152 --> 01:21:49,410
I can't stand this eternal night.

620
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,752
Calm down, Erland.
Calm down.

621
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,918
Let me be! Go away!

622
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:15,920
Forgive me, Helena.
Sometimes I'm not myself.

623
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,519
You know that.

624
01:22:19,801 --> 01:22:20,948
I'm another person

625
01:22:22,450 --> 01:22:24,022
Someone I don't know

626
01:22:26,456 --> 01:22:27,473
Here's all I got

627
01:22:28,627 --> 01:22:30,762
It appears that all animals
are afraid of the plague.

628
01:22:30,783 --> 01:22:31,808
They also

629
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,788
Yes, one of your gloves.
I found it at the spring.

630
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,011
So it wasn't a bad dream...

631
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,071
Then it was real!

632
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,437
Why do you stop?

633
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,260
Where is she? Tell me where she is!

634
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:03,993
Take me to her right away!

635
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:14,637
Son of a snake! You're gonna die!
Both of you have to die!

636
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:51,736
- What's the matter?
-I can't really understand it

637
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:54,054
I think Sir Erland is raving mad

638
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:02,742
So, Erasmus, drink!
Come here!

639
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:08,235
Why don't you drink?
Drink! Drink!

640
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:14,456
You! All you, why are you not drinking?
Pour into your glasses!

641
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,520
One should drink before the hunt

642
01:26:25,142 --> 01:26:28,069
We're going out witch hunting!

643
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:35,000
She hides somewhere in the woods.

644
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:39,273
But the dogs will get her scent

645
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:52,762
I will nail her alive at 
the port of the castle

646
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,397
And then...

647
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:07,959
Then,finally I'll be calm during night

648
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:04,473
Father...

649
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:08,833
I wanted to find the treasure...

650
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:15,119
... before...

651
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:23,314
My own boy...

652
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:28,435
Mother has never hurt you

653
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:30,631
My boy

654
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:38,193
You must like her very very much

655
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:42,501
But child... What's the matter with you?

656
01:28:43,385 --> 01:28:49,707
Yes, it's fine. I'm so happy with you.

657
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:11,434
Sorgbarn!

658
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:17,750
My son...

659
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:24,831
I've killed my son!

660
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:55,035
Sorgbarn!Sorgbarn my dear!

661
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:59,039
My dear!

662
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:07,118
Erland... what have you done?

663
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:15,830
Singoalla, my love.

664
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:20,632
Look how beautiful he is.

665
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:05,959
Here it is!
As fast as possible!

666
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:19,360
Come, my love

667
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:28,437
Let me support you.

668
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:01,298
Here you have your castle.

669
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:26,429
-You are tired.
-My road was endlessly long

670
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:30,242
... before I found you.

671
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,934
Do you hear?

672
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:31,310
The song...
The bells ..

673
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:38,595
It's for us. It's for our wedding.

674
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:41,474
Yes, my love.

675
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:44,276
Your hand...

676
01:36:45,752 --> 01:36:47,865
Do you notice the smell of roses,Singoalla?

677
01:36:52,255 --> 01:36:54,870
The whole room is filled with roses.

678
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:59,757
You

679
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:09,643
There is only you in the whole world

680
01:37:10,640 --> 01:37:16,021
There has never been
a love like ours.

681
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:22,447
But I think I have to sleep now

682
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:26,597
But I'm with you,
even when I sleep.

683
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:36,559
Give me something to drink. I'm thirsty.

684
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:42,392
Now you're my prisoner.
I'll never let you go anymore

685
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:47,236
My Singoalla...

686
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:27,709
Your Singoalla...

687
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:47,669
Is it you, Sorgbarn?

688
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:53,870
Is that you,my boy?

689
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:59,749
You are playing

690
01:39:02,666 --> 01:39:04,712
You mustn't be noisy

691
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:09,222
Your mother is just going to sleep

692
