1
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,800
Avalanche!

2
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,000
Cool!

3
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,200
Great!

4
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,520
Awesome!

5
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,600
Horrifying!

6
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,200
Don't help them.

7
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,080
Stand up!

8
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Morons! You're useless!

9
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,840
That's all for today.

10
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,000
Dismiss!

11
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,720
Yes!

12
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,960
Awesome!

13
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,280
That move just now...

14
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,240
Go away!

15
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,920
How many times have I told you,
no bubble gum in class.

16
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,760
You're really awesome!

17
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,160
-Really?
-Yes, especially your ultimate move,

18
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,000
the Avalanche.

19
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,640
The masculinity...

20
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,680
and how your hair swayed back and forth,

21
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,520
how impressive!

22
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,080
Are you free tonight?

23
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,960
Come watch TV at my place.

24
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,440
My bed's big and comfy.

25
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,760
You're crazy.

26
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,360
Grizzly tried to pick you up.
Why didn't you say yes?

27
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,560
Grizzly? Come watch TV at my place.
My bed's big and comfy.

28
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,560
That's exactly like him!

29
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
That's true...

30
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,680
Tell us, what are you looking
for in a man?

31
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,680
Yes!

32
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,640
He must be kind, gentle and brave.
A real hero.

33
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,600
DATE WANTED

34
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,640
I don't know about heroes,

35
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,560
but you can definitely find
good-looking people here.

36
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,320
Look. Gorgeous and smart,

37
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
I'm 36, 24, 36 and lonely.

38
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,840
Let me be a part of your life.

39
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,920
Call 4567. That's my number.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But remember, never call 116.

41
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,560
He's known for hit-and-runs.

42
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,760
But the last time we met,

43
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,160
he left as soon as he saw me.

44
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,360
He didn't even touch me.

45
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,520
What's wrong with that?

46
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,200
At least you didn't catch anything.

47
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
-Go change.
-OK.

48
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,320
I think you're going crazy!

49
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,200
Li, I'm telling you.

50
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,760
There are no more heroes
in this day and age.

51
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,240
Did you call the police?

52
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,440
Yes, officer.

53
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,680
Have you been robbed?

54
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,600
Yes, cleaned me out.

55
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,720
What's your name?

56
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,600
He Jin Yin.

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,160
Show me your ID card.

58
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,040
Look at me, officer.

59
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,720
Where can I possibly hide it?

60
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,320
Doesn't take a genius to rob you.

61
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
What?

62
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,200
Did you recognize the robber?

63
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,320
-What did he look like?
-Let me try.

64
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,680
Do you remember
what the guy looked like?

65
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,400
So what if I do? He had my consent.

66
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,000
What do you mean, man?

67
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,120
This is what happened.

68
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,160
I was walking by.

69
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,760
A man in rags came towards me.

70
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,880
He asked me for $20 to buy food.

71
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
I felt sorry for him and gave him $20.

72
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,320
Then he told me
that his wife and son have not eaten

73
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,680
and have no clothes.

74
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,200
He took off my clothes,

75
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,200
snatched my wallet, and asked if I minded.
I told him I do mind,

76
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,880
but I'd let it slide
since he needed help.

77
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,560
I offered to take off my underwear,

78
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,480
because I should help him all the way.

79
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,120
I was worried I'd get arrested
for indecent exposure.

80
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,920
So, I called the police
to put it on the record.

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,240
That's all.

82
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,520
I see.

83
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,480
PC26324, we have a nudist on our hands,

84
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,080
suspected of mental disability
and obstructing police work.

85
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,760
-Please send backup.
-Did you hear me wrongly?

86
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,160
Let me repeat the story.

87
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,680
-Take him away!
-Let's go, retarded nudist.

88
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,920
-Officer, I'm really...
-Cut the crap.

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,920
I pitied the guy, why would I lie?

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,360
People like you
make the world more pitiful.

91
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,640
Get up and eat!

92
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,800
Try the clothes on later. See if they fit.

93
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,000
Can't believe there's such a nice person
in this world.

94
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,080
He's a kindhearted man.

95
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,920
I'm back!

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,560
So what?

97
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,080
You must be thirsty. Have some water.

98
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,360
Thanks.

99
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,320
It's spicy!

100
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,360
Not spicy enough? I'll add more.

101
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,160
Boss, next time you have an order
for North Point...

102
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,480
send someone else.

103
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,800
I had to climb up the hill.
I almost didn't make it.

104
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,600
It's for your own good.
It gives you proper training.

105
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,000
Take this to Wan Hua.

106
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,680
What did you say?
I can't take this anymore, Boss.

107
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,360
You're really the boss' pet.
I'm so jealous.

108
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,560
Stop teasing me.

109
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,160
-You could tell?
-Boss.

110
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,520
There's a fly in my soup.

111
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,000
Let me see.

112
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,920
-Johnny...
-Don't give me that!

113
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,560
I had some of it,

114
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,160
and the fly is still swimming around
like it's showing off

115
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,960
and mocking me.

116
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,080
Say no more!

117
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,960
We're fastidious about hygiene.

118
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,560
It's not just you.

119
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,360
We hate flies too. Kill it.

120
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,040
-Hurry! We must kill it.
-What are you doing?

121
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,520
-Crush it...
-Why did you fly into the soup?

122
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,840
Hygiene is our top priority.
I'll kill it for you.

123
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,720
Hey, I just want another bowl of soup.

124
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,920
Why all the fuss?

125
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,120
Just give me another bowl.

126
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,560
Oh, that's all?

127
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,920
Stop, everyone!

128
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,280
The fly is here...

129
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,640
Help!

130
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,920
Forget it!

131
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,440
-It's over! Get back to your tables.
-It's all right...

132
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,360
All right. Come here!

133
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,880
If we didn't make a scene,

134
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,360
we wouldn't get paid
and save a bowl of soup.

135
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,440
We must do our best, right?

136
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,320
-Yes...
-Good job!

137
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,560
Isn't it too much?

138
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,960
You don't have to break
a bottle to kill a fly.

139
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,200
I was just trying to help.

140
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,280
That bottle costs 50 cents, you moron!

141
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,640
Where's the beer bottle?

142
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,880
Behind you.

143
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,800
Chief, what do you think?

144
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,480
Excellent! You're the only woman
who can throw me over.

145
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,880
It's my birthday today.
Come join my party.

146
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,840
We're in class. They're all staring at us.
Don't talk about this.

147
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,800
I won't let go unless you say yes.

148
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,400
Let go of me, you maniac!

149
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,680
Let go!

150
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,720
-Thanks.
-Don't mention it.

151
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,520
Bye!

152
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,720
It's OK if you're busy tonight.

153
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,040
What about tomorrow?

154
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,080
I have two tickets
to Jacky Cheung's concert.

155
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,040
Let's go together.

156
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,960
Having my period tomorrow. I can't go out.

157
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,360
What a coincidence!
So am I!

158
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,960
What a coincidence!

159
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,080
Delivery?

160
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,400
Morning...

161
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,280
Hey, give me a sandwich.

162
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,520
Only if you pay.

163
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,160
You're catching on!

164
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,160
You don't have a girlfriend, take her!

165
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,640
Stop it!

166
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,880
He's not so bad.

167
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,360
If you're not coming to the party,

168
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,960
at least give me a birthday kiss.

169
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,360
Li, I'm so nice to you.

170
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,600
You know how many girls
want my attention,

171
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,720
but they don't get any.

172
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,520
Why don't you grab your chance?

173
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,440
I don't know either.

174
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,800
I'll kiss anyone but you.

175
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,960
What? Kiss anyone?

176
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,160
Don't talk nonsense.

177
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,400
Don't lie to yourself, Li.
I know you love me.

178
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,320
I'm telling you, you can't kiss anyone.

179
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,720
-Sorry, I'm a little late.
-Anyone but me!

180
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Don't give me this bullshit.
Get over here now!

181
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,840
Don't do that.
What if I fall for you?

182
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,040
Do you want to go
for Jacky Cheung's concert?

183
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,160
Let's go together.

184
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,360
I'm busy.

185
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,680
Busy my foot! Let's go.

186
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,360
-Stop right there! You hear me?
-Calm down.

187
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,680
Let go of me! Come back!

188
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,240
The manager is looking for you.

189
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,920
I like Jacky Cheung too.

190
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,240
If you really want to go,

191
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,960
I'll be happy to go with you,
but preferably on Wednesday.

192
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,840
That's the only day I'm off
in the whole month.

193
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,120
What's the kid doing with Li?

194
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,000
If you must go today,
do you mind if I wear a hat?

195
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,920
Or give me some time
to fix my hair.

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,520
My hairstyle doesn't really match
with your personality. May I?

197
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,880
Sorry.

198
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,040
I kissed you without asking.

199
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,760
-I was only kidding.
-Kidding?

200
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,920
Yes!

201
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,160
I'm so relieved!

202
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,520
It's all right. Don't be silly.

203
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,920
It happens to me all the time.

204
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,160
Good!

205
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,920
Run along!

206
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,960
I'll leave when my legs quit trembling
and my heart slows down.

207
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,920
I'm sorry.

208
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,760
Is there anything I can help you with?

209
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,120
No... I'm fine.

210
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,000
I'll sit down for a while.

211
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,520
What's your name?

212
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,880
He Jin Yin. I'm a delivery boy.

213
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,360
Forgot my name card today.

214
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,600
Mr. He, my name is Li.

215
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,440
Nice to meet you, Li.

216
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,200
I have to go! Bye.

217
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,240
Li!

218
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,040
About Jacky Cheung's concert,
is that a joke too?

219
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,360
I want to go,
but the tickets are hard to get.

220
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,440
Not really, if you try hard enough.

221
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,280
Where there's a will, there's a way.

222
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,960
Bye!

223
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Bye!

224
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,040
TICKET OFFICE OPENS AT 9:00 A.M.

225
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,360
-Get in line...
-Jacky Cheung... we love you.

226
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,960
-Get in line...
-Jacky Cheung... we love you.

227
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,600
-Queue up!
-Jacky Cheung... we love you.

228
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,120
Jacky Cheung... we love you.

229
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,480
I love Leon Lai...

230
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,160
Fix him... we love Jacky Cheung!

231
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,600
You old prick!

232
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,120
Mister.

233
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
Can I take your place for $1,000?

234
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,960
Sorry, this is important to me.

235
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,760
I promised my girlfriend
I'll get concert tickets.

236
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,320
How about $2,000?

237
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,040
It's not about the money.
It's the effort that counts.

238
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,160
I sacrificed my only day off in a month
and camped out here overnight.

239
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,680
Why are you doing this?

240
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,840
If your girlfriend finds out
your dirty tricks...

241
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,560
-she'll never forgive you.
-What a fool.

242
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,080
Hey!

243
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,800
I promised my boyfriend
I'll get tickets.

244
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
-Can I have your place?
-Sorry, but you can't.

245
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,120
I'll buy you dinner.

246
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
-Just one dinner?
-How many do you want?

247
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,960
-At least three or four.
-No way!

248
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,040
If I were you,
even if it took 30 dinners,

249
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
I'd do it for my partner,
without a doubt.

250
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,600
How can you do that? You're crazy!

251
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,280
If you won't sacrifice for love,
you'll never get the concert tickets.

252
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,040
Mister, my grandson
wants me to get tickets,

253
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,200
but there's such a long queue.
Can you give me your spot?

254
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,800
I really love my grandson.

255
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,280
Even if you don't pay me,
or take me to dinner,

256
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,560
for the fact that you love your grandson,
you can take my spot.

257
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,360
How kind of you!
You'll be rewarded.

258
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,440
-Hurry.
-Get in line...

259
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,440
Two tickets please.

260
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,800
Sorry. That old lady bought
all the tickets.

261
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,320
No! I only need two tickets.

262
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,080
There were only 20. We're sold out now.

263
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,520
-No more! Go away, all of you!
-You're kidding.

264
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,440
-Granny!
-Go! Leave!

265
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,360
Granny! Granny!

266
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,760
Granny!

267
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,360
-What?
-Do me a favor.

268
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,520
-I just want two tickets.
-I gave them all to my grandson.

269
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,960
-Where is he?
-Outside... holding all the tickets.

270
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,800
Tickets for Jacky Cheung concert,

271
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,040
$500 each! Front seats $1,500.

272
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,920
Hurry before it's gone.

273
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,600
Hey kid, don't jump queue!

274
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,360
-Two tickets please.
-No problem.

275
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,680
-Young man.
-Officer.

276
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,840
You're arrested for scalping.

277
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,600
-Give me a chance, officer.
-Come with me.

278
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,880
Sorry, guys.

279
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,360
What are you still doing here?

280
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,240
I was just trying to get two tickets.

281
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,880
It's so unfair.

282
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,720
Of course you couldn't get them.

283
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,840
They're all here.

284
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,040
-Jacky?
-Here!

285
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,640
I love you, Jacky!

286
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,160
No thanks. I have a girlfriend.

287
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,960
Li, Jacky Cheung
made me believe in miracles.

288
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,760
Now I have the guts to ask you out.

289
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,840
Enclosed please find two concert tickets.

290
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,400
I hope we can go together.
Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.,

291
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,240
I'll wait at the bus stop outside.
Sincerely, Yin.

292
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,160
-Here's the delivery boy.
-Li.

293
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,560
Mr. He. Hello!

294
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,360
-What a coincidence!
-Yes!

295
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,760
I brought you an egg sandwich.

296
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,200
Sorry, I don't eat eggs.

297
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,440
-Let's go! Hurry...
-Bye!

298
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,560
Li, give it to your mother
if you don't want it.

299
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,760
Let me eat it!

300
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,760
We're late, let's go.

301
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,480
-Talk to you again.
-Let's go.

302
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,880
Help!

303
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,119
That bitch ate my sandwich!

304
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,280
-What's wrong?
-Are you all right?

305
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,640
-My throat...
-Is it serious?

306
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,319
-I feel like throwing up.
-I'll pat you on the back.

307
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,079
What is this?

308
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,119
Hey, your concert tickets
almost got me killed yesterday.

309
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,359
Li is waiting for you by the bus stop.

310
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,599
Really?

311
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,480
Trust me! You owe me dinner!

312
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,120
Anything you say!

313
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,840
No one can compare to you

314
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,320
I'll never forget your smile

315
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,640
You're the one I love

316
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,520
Kiss me with those tender lips

317
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,640
I can't help myself

318
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,400
I'm losing control

319
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,760
Are you all right?

320
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,320
I'm fine. No problem at all.

321
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,640
-How are you, Mr. He?
-Hi...

322
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,840
This is for you.

323
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,080
Thanks.

324
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,880
You're welcome.

325
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,480
-Let's shake hands.
-Sure!

326
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,880
You're strange!
I've never met anyone like you.

327
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,760
Thanks...

328
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,880
Anyway, thanks for the tickets.

329
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,280
My pleasure.

330
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,920
Come on, don't be shy!

331
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,160
No, don't...

332
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,160
How's it going?

333
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,960
Hey, thanks so much.

334
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,720
-Thanks for what?
-Whatever.

335
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,200
What's going on?
You look scared as shit.

336
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,240
Bingo!

337
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,360
You kissed her yesterday.

338
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,920
Are you getting into the sack
with her today?

339
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,520
What are you talking about?
He's my friend.

340
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,760
Mind your manners.

341
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,320
Am I provoking you?
I dare you to hit me.

342
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,080
Hit me... come on.

343
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,280
Hit me hard! Come on...

344
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,560
You don't need more hitting.
You've been punished enough.

345
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,680
What's this?

346
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,320
I guess it's shit.
But I don't know whose!

347
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,120
Bastard! How dare you play with shit?

348
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,160
You bastard! How could you dodge?

349
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,480
How could you do that?
What kind of a man are you? Coward!

350
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,160
Li, come watch TV.

351
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,680
No.

352
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,040
Madonna is singing.
Come quickly!

353
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,800
I don't want to.

354
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,960
Are you all right?

355
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,840
I'm fine.

356
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,280
Here comes Madonna. Come quickly!

357
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,120
I said I don't want to watch it!

358
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,880
She's wearing a tuxedo!

359
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,400
Don't be a nag, Mother!

360
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,720
Li.

361
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,720
What is it?
What are you doing here?

362
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,640
I came to apologize.

363
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,880
Don't be silly.
There's no need to apologize.

364
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,120
It's not your fault.

365
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,360
-How is your nose?
-Fine.

366
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,880
Really?

367
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,160
Really!

368
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,480
You're lying.

369
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,440
I hit myself on the nose casually,
and it hurt so bad I was in tears.

370
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,800
Sorry, I'm really fine.
Please don't worry.

371
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,080
Don't lie to me.

372
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,000
I insist that you go to the hospital
for a check-up.

373
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,720
It can be severe.

374
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,760
You may have internal bleeding
or nasosinusitis,

375
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,120
or even cancer if you're out of luck.

376
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,360
You may be dying and don't know it.

377
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,840
Are you finished?

378
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,320
It's late, I want to go to bed.
You better leave.

379
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,680
Here, take this back.

380
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,800
Please don't do this to me, Li.
Please give me another chance.

381
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,160
I treasure what we have.
It's important to me.

382
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,000
This is a misunderstanding, Mr. He.

383
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,320
I don't like cowards.

384
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,280
I didn't even touch him.

385
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,960
He's already on his knees begging
and howling like a dog.

386
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,360
-Do you know who I hit?
-Who?

387
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,560
Li.

388
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,480
She flew nine feet high
and spun two full circles.

389
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,160
Isn't that wonderful?

390
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,080
You're bragging about injuring someone.
How can you do that?

391
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,960
What about the shit you had
all over your face?

392
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,440
-Why don't you mention that?
-Shit all over your face?

393
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,240
What did you say?

394
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,520
I'm saying...
that you better apologize to Li.

395
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,720
There you go. That's how the coward
ducked yesterday.

396
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,360
Coward!

397
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,560
Are you all right, Li?

398
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,240
Don't move!

399
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,840
I tried calling you last night.
Did you know?

400
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,360
You didn't pick up, I was so worried.

401
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,640
I couldn't sleep at all.

402
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,680
Stop, Grizzly!
Don't do that to him!

403
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,600
I didn't do anything.

404
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,120
Go deliver your order.

405
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,520
Did you hear me?

406
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,240
Asshole.

407
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,760
Are you hurt, moron?

408
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,640
Coward, you deserve to be hit.

409
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,160
I don't like cowards.

410
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,640
Useless fool!

411
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,120
Stupid.

412
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,240
-What is he doing?
-He's an idiot.

413
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,840
Forget it, let's practice!

414
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,760
We don't open until 9:00.

415
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,840
It's 8:45, fifteen more minutes to go.

416
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,680
What do you want?

417
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,760
I'm a coward.

418
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,600
It's obvious. You should've come
last night, idiot.

419
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,560
Twenty dollars.

420
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,120
-Twenty dollars?
-Yes.

421
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
Apply a thin layer 30 minutes beforehand.

422
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,920
INDIAN MAGIC OIL

423
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,160
Don't be too greedy. There was a kid
who once used the whole bottle and...

424
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,600
No, I don't need this.

425
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,200
I want my money back.

426
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,120
Your fingerprints are all over it.
I can't return your money.

427
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,640
Then give me two beers instead.

428
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,920
All right!

429
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,000
Give me $8 more.

430
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,880
I'll keep the change.
Here's a pack of peanuts.

431
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,800
Don't stare, or it'll cost you more.
Go away!

432
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
Look at you.

433
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,760
One word is tattooed on your face.
Heartbroken.

434
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,960
Here.

435
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,680
You really are?

436
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,720
So what? Everyone goes through that.

437
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,000
The first time?

438
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,880
That should be the hardest.

439
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,160
You don't need a beer now.

440
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,360
I think...

441
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,880
you should change into
something more cheerful.

442
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,440
Listen to a good song
and eat a big breakfast.

443
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,760
You'll feel much better.

444
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,440
Let me help you.

445
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,120
Trust me.

446
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,040
Come on!

447
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,800
This is the best deal for you.

448
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,480
Nice clothes, a song and a big breakfast.

449
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,720
I'm only charging you
60 cents per second.

450
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,760
What do you think?

451
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,680
I think I've been had.

452
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,080
Really?

453
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,520
Does that take your mind off
the fact that you've been dumped?

454
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,600
-Maybe.
-Get more into it!

455
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,280
Be brave and sing along.

456
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,280
I guarantee you'll feel better. Sing!

457
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,000
Use the microphone.

458
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,200
Don't look at me, look over there.

459
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,440
Please pass the ball back.

460
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,760
It's raining... Hurry...

461
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,640
Are you all right, old man?

462
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,040
Don't be silly. I know kung fu.

463
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,000
Kung fu?

464
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,240
Yes, that's right.

465
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,960
I can teach you. 20% off.

466
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,840
CHINESE ANCIENT BOXING

467
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,080
At this sports center,

468
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,640
the Chinese Ancient Boxing school
has a long history.

469
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,520
I'm the current Chief.

470
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,880
What should I call you, old man?

471
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,080
You can call me the Devilish Muscle Man.

472
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,160
Anything but old man, OK?

473
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,200
Sure!

474
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,760
So, Devilish Muscle Man,
why is the boxing gym

475
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,280
behind your grocery store?

476
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,920
The grocery store is a side business.

477
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,720
I'm a boxing coach by profession.

478
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,240
Fame is not my game.

479
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,560
I hate people who court publicity.

480
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,160
Bruce Lee was my classmate,
but do I brag about it?

481
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,640
Jackie Chan likes to have tea with me,

482
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,040
but I don't have time for him.

483
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,560
That's him, see that?

484
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,840
Do I tell you about him?

485
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,280
What's the big deal?

486
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,840
So, what do you want to learn?

487
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,840
What can you teach me?

488
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,800
Iron Sand Palm.

489
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,400
Originating from Si Shui,
it is a powerful skill...

490
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,120
capable of shattering
anyone's internal organs,

491
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,120
causing death even before
arrival at the hospital.

492
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,680
Shit.

493
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,800
This takes three days to learn
and costs $600.

494
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,240
The Armor Skill.

495
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
It's from Southern Shaolin,
70 km north of Fujian

496
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,720
and 30 knots south of Shan Mei.

497
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,480
It'll render you impenetrable
to all weapons,

498
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,720
including fire and water.

499
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,280
This takes five days and $800.

500
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
Flying Guillotine.

501
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,800
From the late Ming and early Qing dynasty,

502
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,760
it's the official weapon
of imperial assassins,

503
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,120
capable of decapitating
anyone from miles away.

504
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,400
Because it is lethal,
I'm using this yo-yo instead.

505
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,080
This takes seven days and $1,000.

506
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,720
Poison Dragon Drill.

507
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,640
It originated from a comic
and started out as a fantasy.

508
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,280
But I have modified it
and turned it into powerful footwork.

509
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,720
It'll cost $1,500.

510
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,880
Lightning Death Ray.

511
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,840
It has killed numerous monsters

512
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,840
and ferocious dinosaurs.

513
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,600
Took young people by storm
in the seventies.

514
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,920
But I can tell you it's fake.

515
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,080
There is no such thing.

516
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,800
It only exists in the movies,
I must tell you.

517
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,520
You don't have to worry.

518
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,480
Honesty and practicality are my motto.

519
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,840
-I...
-I have to make it clear...

520
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,880
I choose my students
based on their potential.

521
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,760
I don't teach just anyone
who wants to learn.

522
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,360
-I better go.
-Don't!

523
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,400
We're getting along just fine.
You don't have to worry.

524
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,920
-I think it's too expensive.
-Prices are negotiable.

525
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,600
I'm not making much out of this.

526
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,080
I might teach you for free
if you have potential.

527
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,760
-Really?
-Really!

528
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,520
That's not a good idea.

529
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,800
Your leg...

530
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,120
I don't want you to overexert yourself.

531
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,400
Sorry for the intrusion.

532
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,680
Iron Sand Palm emphasizes inner strength.

533
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,640
It can kill without being noticed.

534
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,040
It's amazing!

535
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,240
Fame is not my game.

536
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,040
Please don't tell anyone
I'm a kung fu expert.

537
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,240
-I'm just an ordinary cripple.
-Yes!

538
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,680
Can you beat judo?

539
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,880
Judo?

540
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,760
You're kidding.
Of course I can beat judo!

541
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,240
Chinese kung fu has a history
of thousands of years.

542
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,680
As they say,
there are no cowards with kung fu.

543
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,560
Can you teach me?

544
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,040
I told you, I make no promises.

545
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,720
Tell me what you want to learn.

546
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,720
Everything.

547
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,880
Huh? That would cost you a bomb.

548
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,240
And it's exhausting!

549
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,240
I don't mind.
I want to be strong.

550
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,000
Very good!

551
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,000
From the fire in your eyes,
I know you have great potential.

552
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,640
Cut the bullshit and pay up.

553
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,800
Fine.

554
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,520
Your fees, Master.
Wait!

555
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,200
-What?
-This is my hard earned money, so...

556
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,720
Don't worry. I understand.

557
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,480
I'll train you up in no time.

558
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,960
-Wait!
-What now?

559
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,560
You said you'll teach me for free
if I have potential.

560
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,040
Good question! Hang on!

561
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,440
The money is not for me.

562
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,440
It'll be donated to fellow Chinese...

563
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,320
KUNG FU FOR ALL

564
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,840
...so that they can all receive
not only education,

565
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,920
but also kung fu training.

566
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,040
How meaningful.

567
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,560
Yes, put it in!

568
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,400
Done.

569
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,320
You're now a student
of Ancient Chinese Boxing.

570
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,280
Congratulations!

571
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,040
ANCIENT CHINESE BOXING

572
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,960
-Let's go.
-Yes.

573
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,320
-Li.
-Hi.

574
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,000
-Going to class?
-Yes.

575
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,720
Let me tell you something.
I'm secretly practicing kung fu.

576
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,200
Really?

577
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,680
Yes. I can also tell you,
I'm getting really good at it.

578
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,880
Anytime you run into any trouble,
just let me know.

579
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,560
It doesn't matter what time.
I stay up late.

580
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,120
Really? Let's try it out!

581
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,440
Thanks.

582
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,600
There he goes again.

583
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,760
Bastard!

584
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
What are you doing?

585
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,200
You're supposed to wash the rice,
not jab it.

586
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,600
You've been at it for half an hour!

587
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,840
What has the rice done to you?

588
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,040
Did it kill your father?

589
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,120
You can kill it with a knife.

590
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,560
Stop jabbing!

591
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,200
I'm practicing, Boss.

592
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,920
-Practicing?
-Yes.

593
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,760
Why don't you practice on me?
Jab me, come on!

594
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,480
Are you all right, Boss?

595
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,200
Asshole!

596
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,840
Noodles.

597
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,800
What's this?

598
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,480
Curry beef with braised noodles.

599
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,200
I wanted fried noodles.

600
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,280
-I'll get you another one.
-Let me handle this.

601
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,240
Bloody hell.

602
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,520
-Sorry! I'll do it.
-Using his hands!

603
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,960
Sorry. Please calm down.

604
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,680
The kitchen is swamped.

605
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,200
-He made a mistake.
-Here it is, sir!

606
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,680
How could he use his hands?

607
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,680
Enjoy your meal.

608
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,200
Did you do it on purpose?

609
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,000
Doing that in front of the customer,
you want me to close down this shop?

610
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,000
Where is your conscience?

611
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,520
Next time, do it in the kitchen,
not in front of the customer!

612
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,760
I've been practicing kung fu
so much lately that it became a habit.

613
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,800
What's wrong with you?

614
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,480
You're dreaming. What teacher?
What kung fu?

615
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,640
You're an idiot, who would teach you?

616
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,760
He's taking advantage of you.

617
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,560
If you don't take advantage of me,
I'd be eternally grateful.

618
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,240
What? I took advantage of you?

619
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,320
You were an orphan.

620
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,240
-You were all alone.
-All right, Boss...

621
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,160
-I took sympathy on you and took you in.
-Calm down.

622
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,280
I fed you and put a roof over your head.

623
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,640
How could you say that?

624
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,600
Stop it!

625
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,800
-If you're not happy here...
-Stop the yelling.

626
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,720
You're welcome to leave. Go!

627
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,080
No one is asking you to stay.

628
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,880
Yin, we were just joking
when we teased you. Don't go!

629
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,000
What are you doing?

630
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,000
Where are you going?

631
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,280
Don't mind him! Get back to work!

632
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,600
All right... it's over.

633
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,560
Have a seat. Enjoy your meal.

634
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,240
ANCIENT CHINESE BOXING

635
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,160
Yin.

636
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,000
Everyone needs an
identity and self respect.

637
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,719
As a student of Ancient Chinese Boxing,

638
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,040
you should have a uniform.

639
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,239
Here you go!

640
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:21,400
You're my life saver, Master!

641
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,719
You deserve it.

642
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,679
Wear it.

643
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,440
People will show you due respect.

644
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,000
Also...

645
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,400
this is our treasured Jiu Yin manual.

646
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,280
Keep it.

647
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,000
Jiu Yin manual?

648
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,520
So, this kung fu requires a mask?

649
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,560
Really? Oh, you can fight better
with a mask on.

650
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,800
Get up. Take a seat.

651
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,679
You're too nice to me.

652
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,639
Don't say that.

653
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,440
I've given you two treasures.

654
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,840
You should help our suffering countrymen.

655
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,920
After all, blood is thicker than water.

656
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
Just twenty dollars?

657
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,840
You donated $500 for the last stance!

658
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,760
This is all I have left!

659
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,480
Now, get this straight. It's not for me.

660
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,480
It's up to you how much you're giving.

661
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,160
I'm just as happy
even if you donate nothing.

662
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,280
But if you have any jewelry at home

663
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,160
or shares...

664
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,480
Master, for my fellow countrymen

665
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,400
I've done all I could.

666
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,640
I'm broke now.

667
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,280
What about your salary?

668
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,520
I have a job, but I hate it.

669
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,760
I'm thinking of quitting.

670
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,520
I have nothing.

671
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,360
But since you're so nice to me,

672
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,280
I'll stay with you from now on,

673
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,960
practicing and looking after you.

674
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,320
Master, what's wrong?
You're shuddering!

675
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,800
Nothing.

676
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,320
In that case, you leave me no choice.

677
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,360
Come with me.

678
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,840
Now I'll teach you
the most formidable movement.

679
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,800
But Master...

680
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,240
It's not in this manual,
it's in another one.

681
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,640
Now, it will depend on you.

682
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,760
Trust me, I can do it.

683
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,200
Roll down from here.

684
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,240
What? Are you kidding me? All those steps?
What kind of kung fu is this?

685
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,960
Are you serious?

686
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,640
This is called the Invincible Fireball.

687
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,920
You kill your enemy
by rolling down with him.

688
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,120
Then I'll be dead too.

689
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,640
No! How can you be so stupid?

690
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,840
Hold him tight.

691
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,440
Protect yourself with his body.

692
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,880
Make use of gravity
and universal gravitation.

693
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,200
Apply turbo speed,
using your body weight.

694
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,080
If you can't get rid of your opponent
this way, come and see me.

695
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,160
I still don't understand.

696
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,320
This movement is difficult
and highly dangerous.

697
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,680
I understand if you don't want to learn.

698
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,360
That'll prove that you don't have
what it takes,

699
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,120
so don't come to me again.

700
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
Please don't say that!
I'll do my best.

701
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,720
If you succeed,

702
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,960
it means you're invincible

703
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,360
and you don't need me anymore.
That's all.

704
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,360
Go...

705
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,960
-Master.
-What is it now?

706
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,040
-Are you dumping me right now?
-Whatever you want to call it.

707
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,760
-Master!
-What do you want?

708
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,480
I want to give you this Swatch.

709
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,160
-I always carry it with me.
-How much is it worth?

710
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,880
It's not worth much,
but it was a birthday present

711
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,320
-I bought for myself last year.
-OK, thanks...

712
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,040
Don't mention it.
It has sentimental value.

713
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,760
-I won't let you down.
-Don't be such a nag! Idiot.

714
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,880
He couldn't have!
How stupid can you get!

715
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,040
It hurts!

716
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,840
-I saw everything, Master.
-What?

717
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,760
How to practice the Invincible Fireball.

718
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,200
You did it to show me, right?

719
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,760
Without a second thought,
you tumbled down! That's cool!

720
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,520
I stood up there for the longest time
and didn't dare.

721
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,000
-You saw everything?
-Yes! It was awesome!

722
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,800
This is tough.
I better learn something else, Master.

723
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,840
Something less demanding.

724
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,080
No matter what, I've done a demonstration
and I should get paid.

725
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,280
Sure. No problem.

726
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,160
Then hurry up.
I'm bleeding already.

727
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,000
-OK, come with me!
-No, just give it to me!

728
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,080
Asshole!

729
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,680
Hurry up!

730
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,120
-Morning.
-Morning.

731
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,280
This is for you.

732
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,360
I was rude, I'm sorry.

733
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,760
Forget it.

734
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,360
Why don't you come to my place?
I want to talk to you.

735
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,600
My house is spacious,
my bed's big and comfy.

736
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,480
You're nuts! Don't touch me!

737
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,040
-Please give me a chance.
-Stop.

738
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,680
Chief, your glasses are broken!

739
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,400
What? My Armani is broken!

740
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,240
You broke my Armani!

741
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,360
My Armani...

742
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,120
Don't yell.

743
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,320
She's gone.

744
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,720
-Grab her!
-Yes!

745
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,760
Come back!

746
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,960
-Got her!
-What do you want?

747
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,720
-Let go of me!
-Do you know how long it took me

748
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,760
to save enough for this?

749
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,440
I need this to woo girls.
You must pay for it.

750
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,760
I'll count to three, let go!

751
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,200
One.

752
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,720
I've been after you for so long
and you played hard-to-get.

753
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,520
Now you leave me no choice!

754
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,040
Stop!

755
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,240
Let her go!

756
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,720
-Who is he?
-Garfield. He's my favorite!

757
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,480
Grab her!

758
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,760
Who are you?

759
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,880
Let her go!

760
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,200
Quit the act, asshole!

761
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,560
Take off the mask!

762
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,280
I said let her go!

763
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,960
You're dead meat, talking to me like that!

764
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,840
Don't even think about it. She's mine!

765
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,360
Yeah! He's ready to strike.

766
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,560
-Must be a good show.
-Give me some.

767
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,240
-Crush him!
-I can settle you with one punch.

768
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,520
-Yeah! Strike!
-Yes!

769
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,560
Pathetic! Cut open his mask!

770
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,000
Yeah...

771
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,920
See? Death to those who challenge me.

772
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,920
Li, who's Grizzly fighting?

773
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,320
A masked man challenged Grizzly.

774
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,680
-Huh?
-He's so brave.

775
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,520
I'm invincible!

776
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,440
I told you...

777
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,880
no one can beat me.

778
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:28,280
-Come on!
-Fight him!

779
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,320
Avalanche!

780
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,320
Invincible Fireball.

781
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,080
Incredible!

782
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,440
Hurry, over here.
Hey, over here.

783
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,240
Grab your weapons and beat him!

784
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,320
-He's fallen down there.
-Go have a look.

785
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,680
Chief! Are you all right, Chief?

786
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,320
Find that bastard!

787
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,640
Are you all right, Chief?

788
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,440
Found him?

789
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,960
There's nothing to see here, go away.

790
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,080
Master was right.

791
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,520
I'm really better under the mask.

792
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,720
I finally won.

793
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,320
I won!

794
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,240
Come to the police station.
You're charged with disorderly conduct.

795
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,800
You're suspected of being a triad member.
We need to take that mask as evidence.

796
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,440
Breaking news!
A man with a Garfield mask rescued Li.

797
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,360
Breaking news!
A man with a Garfield mask rescued Li.

798
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,400
Breaking news!
The best combat fighter Grizzly

799
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,200
was beaten for the first time
in three years.

800
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:45,720
Garfield masked man defeated
Grizzly with Invincible Fireball.

801
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,120
Place your bets!
Who is the Garfield masked man, Li?

802
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,440
I told you I don't know who he is. OK?

803
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,600
That's not possible, Li.

804
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,560
If you don't know him,
why would he come to your rescue?

805
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,840
-That's right...
-Don't lie to us.

806
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,520
-Tell us.
-Come on.

807
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,200
I don't know what to say.

808
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,200
All my life,

809
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,280
no one has ever
stood up for me like that.

810
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,880
I wonder who he is.

811
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,200
I know he saved me
without asking for anything in return.

812
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,280
He bounces back every time he's down.

813
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,760
He's truly courageous.

814
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,280
All I want is to meet him

815
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,680
and personally thank him.

816
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,520
You really don't know him?

817
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,920
Then we can't place our bets!

818
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,160
ONE FOR 100,000
JUSTICE BAO - MUTANT - JESUS

819
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,760
I finally see you again.
I've been waiting for you.

820
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,280
Wait! Let me guess.

821
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,400
You must have thick brows,

822
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,800
penetrating eyes,
and masculine features.

823
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,760
I'm so nervous.

824
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,160
You're absolutely right. Kiss me.

825
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,480
Stop!

826
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,560
Actually I saved you.

827
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,120
How will you repay me?

828
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,840
It was me!
Take this hotel room key. I'll wait there.

829
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,240
Take it...

830
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,040
I'm an honest man. I have no fancy words.

831
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,520
Let me hug you.

832
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,040
Li!

833
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,280
No way.

834
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,200
Don't run.

835
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,760
Damn it.

836
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,440
Don't worry. I'm here to save you.

837
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,680
You're despicable!

838
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,680
What are you doing here?

839
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,240
Don't jump queue!

840
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,680
-No...
-Don't you know the rules?

841
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,200
-Get in line.
-Go...

842
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,120
I'm the real guy!

843
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,600
Get in line!

844
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,960
Taxi!

845
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,560
Don't go. Here we come.

846
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,440
I can't breathe back here.

847
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,720
You're here too, Master?

848
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,560
The more the merrier.

849
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,840
I can't believe you're like them.

850
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,640
We're all the same.

851
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,320
Not me. I really saved the girl!

852
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,840
So what?
You couldn't have done it without me.

853
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,400
Without you?
I used the Invincible Fireball.

854
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,880
Cut the bullshit!

855
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,120
You were lucky.

856
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,600
But you won't be so lucky next time.
Try it again and you'll kill yourself.

857
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,160
-What?
-I lied.

858
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,080
Do you want to know
tomorrow's headline?

859
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,240
-What?
-Car crash in the mountains.

860
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,120
Why did you lie to me?

861
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,680
Please. You believed
in the Kung Fu For All campaign.

862
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,360
Who else would fall for it?
Tell me.

863
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,520
Why are you telling me now?

864
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,160
Because you're asking me now.
That's why I'm telling you now.

865
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,120
You didn't ask me before,

866
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,760
I can't possibly tell you,
I'm lying to you.

867
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,000
Don't trust me.

868
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,400
This may not be something to brag about,
but it wasn't my fault.

869
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,720
You were stupid.

870
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,480
Money. I want my money back!

871
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,320
I'd be as stupid as you
if I returned the money.

872
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,040
Damn cripple! You'll have no son.

873
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,720
Hey, don't get personal!

874
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,040
Why not?

875
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,000
Cripple! Swindler! Sex maniac!

876
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,520
Wimp! Sissy! Coward!

877
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,200
I beat Grizzly, I'm not a coward.

878
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,880
You wouldn't beat him without me.

879
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,760
You lied to me. I did it myself.

880
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:45,840
I gave you confidence,

881
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,080
or else you wouldn't dare to challenge him
or go after Li.

882
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,080
-Leave her out of this.
-Why?

883
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,440
What's the big deal?

884
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,000
I dare you to take off
that stupid mask in front of her,

885
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,000
and let her see
your pathetic cowardly face.

886
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,920
Did it yourself? Go to hell!

887
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,320
You'll be a cripple in your next life!

888
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:01,360
Moron.

889
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,080
-Cripple!
-Idiot!

890
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,480
Cripple!
Look at this cripple, everyone...

891
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,960
How pathetic...

892
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,200
Look at this idiot, everyone...

893
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,640
-I dare you to say that again!
-I'll say that again.

894
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,680
-Quit pointing fingers.
-You old cripple.

895
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,120
Get lost, asshole!

896
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,160
I dare you to come and fight me.

897
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,560
Go to hell!

898
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,240
Li.

899
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,280
Li, I must tell you,

900
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,880
the guy with the Garfield mask was me.

901
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,520
You?

902
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,880
Do you have proof?

903
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,040
I can't believe it.

904
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,880
Even you want a piece of me!
What do you want? Come get it.

905
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,120
Are you serious?

906
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,080
I hate scums like you.

907
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,480
Li, listen.

908
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,920
I'm not who you think I am.
Please let me explain.

909
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,440
Stop!

910
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,280
Li, Stop...

911
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,160
Yin.

912
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,720
Hey, Yin...

913
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,680
What's wrong with you?
I have something to ask you.

914
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,920
It has nothing to do with me.

915
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,800
What are you talking about?
Why are you running from me?

916
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,640
I'm busy.

917
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,840
Do you know who the guy
in the Garfield mask is?

918
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,000
No.

919
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Really?

920
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,320
Why are you asking?

921
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,320
I should have guessed.

922
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,320
He must be someone I know.

923
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,440
Good guess.

924
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,080
Do you know why he wears the mask?

925
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,120
Why?

926
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,280
Because he wants to remain anonymous.

927
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,760
He doesn't want people to repay him.

928
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,040
Exactly.

929
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:02,320
He is generous and doesn't ask
for anything in return.

930
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,720
His greatness is comparable
to that of Jesus Christ.

931
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,880
Tell me, how can I repay him?

932
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,160
Simple! Kiss him.

933
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,960
Kiss him?

934
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,640
Don't be shy.

935
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,720
We're in the 20th century.

936
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,560
Put aside the moral issues.

937
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,240
Trust me, you have no choice.

938
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,480
Kissing him is the only way.

939
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,120
Don't miss the chance.

940
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:30,080
You must repay him for saving your life.

941
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,600
Yin, let me introduce to you

942
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,640
the Chief of the Karate Club
at Elite Center.

943
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,640
He came all the way from Japan.

944
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,320
He's an old schoolmate.
I'm so happy to see him.

945
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,920
It was him who rescued me!

946
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,760
Don't bring that up.
Your friend is waiting.

947
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,000
Really? I'll take a look.

948
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,600
Are you from Elite Center?

949
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,560
No.

950
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,280
I don't want Li to hang around
useless garbage.

951
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,520
Stay away from her.

952
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,040
You're calling me garbage?

953
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,200
Yes.

954
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,360
Are you done?

955
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,120
Vivian is waiting for us.

956
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,640
See you later!

957
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,160
Li, you're wrong about...

958
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,560
Thanks for your advice.

959
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,520
GARBAGE COLLECTION POINT

960
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,240
This can't be happening.

961
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,840
I told her to kiss me.
But she kissed him instead.

962
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,560
I sent her straight to the arms
of that bespectacled asshole.

963
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,240
This is too much to handle.

964
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,560
But with my unwavering willpower,
I can take this.

965
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,440
Am I in your way, buddy?

966
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,640
No, it's always been a place for garbage.
Sit here as long as you want.

967
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,240
Nothing you say can harm me now
because I've already gone mad.

968
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,960
One, two, buckle my shoe.

969
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,080
Again...

970
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,760
Buckle my shoe...

971
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,800
Stop!

972
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,400
Come back!

973
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,160
What do you want, man?

974
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,880
Forget the money, I don't even have a job.

975
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,800
Take my life if you want.

976
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,880
Shut up! I need to talk to you.

977
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,240
You know I'm the Garfield
masked hero, right?

978
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,320
-Yes.
-I saved Li.

979
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,360
But she got it wrong.

980
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,920
She thought it was
some karate asshole.

981
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,280
Can you please explain it to her?

982
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,960
I'm afraid she's been lied to.

983
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:37,440
Sure, I'll tell her
the next time I see her.

984
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,760
Thanks, but no!

985
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,480
Not when you see her.
You need to go find her.

986
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,760
I'll go tell her later.

987
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:47,160
-I'll go with you now.
-Wait.

988
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:51,360
Given your current status,

989
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,040
if you tell her you're
the Garfield masked hero, isn't it a pity?

990
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,960
Why don't you tell her
you're the U.S. President?

991
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,520
President? Maybe later.

992
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,880
But now, I want to clarify this.
Let's go...

993
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,200
Get a grip!

994
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,280
Look at you.
Who would believe you? Go away!

995
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,880
I have nothing to live for.

996
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,600
Then you should die.

997
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,920
Yes! But before that

998
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,840
I need to teach that asshole a lesson
because he called me garbage.

999
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,400
But you are garbage. Look...

1000
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,360
Come... look at you.

1001
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,760
You blend in so well with garbage.

1002
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,120
Don't deny it.

1003
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,320
To prove that I'm not, I'll beat him up.

1004
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,360
Sure, go ahead!
Do that for me too.

1005
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,520
Then teach me kung fu again.

1006
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,680
I told you I lied to you.

1007
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,880
Why are you so persistent?
Are you an idiot?

1008
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,040
I won because you lied to me.
Might as well lie to me again.

1009
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,840
I told you it was pure luck.

1010
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,080
Believe it or not.

1011
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,680
Don't come to me again! Now get lost!

1012
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,880
-Will you lie to me?
-No!

1013
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,400
-I'll slash your face!
-I dare you!

1014
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,360
Let me tell you, bastard.
I'm a cultured person,

1015
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,480
I won't swindle anyone again. You hear me?

1016
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,320
Now get lost...

1017
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,760
LETTER OF CHALLENGE

1018
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:14,480
BORN TO KILL
NO APOLOGIES

1019
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:17,520
Karate chief. Is the Karate chief in?
Fetch him for me.

1020
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,280
Delivery boy! You haven't
made a delivery for a long time.

1021
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,880
Yes, I've been unwell.
I needed to rest.

1022
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,320
Storekeeper, I thought you quit already.

1023
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,760
Why are you here?

1024
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,200
I miss you, Mary.

1025
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,360
Really?

1026
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:31,040
-Would you like to go out?
-Take me to a movie.

1027
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:33,320
How about Loving Mary?

1028
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:36,440
-You can take my mother.
-Sure! Does your father mind?

1029
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,760
You're obscene.

1030
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,040
What do you mean obscene? I'm romantic.

1031
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,480
We're not here to get a date.

1032
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,680
I walked in like a murderer.

1033
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,680
Now you're embarrassing me.

1034
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,280
Where is the Karate chief?

1035
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,000
In a meeting with Mr. Chen.

1036
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,480
Pass this letter to him. Let's go.

1037
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,440
Come here.

1038
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,800
-Oh, so…
-Hey.

1039
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,400
ELITE CENTER PERSONAL COMBAT DEPARTMENT

1040
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,360
JUDO DIVISION

1041
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,360
In terms of personal combat,

1042
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:16,400
Elite Center is second to
none in southeast Asia.

1043
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,320
Our impeccable reputation
is attributed to our department chiefs.

1044
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,200
Chief of Tae Kwon Do.

1045
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,040
His feet are as agile as his hands,

1046
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,680
attacking the opponent
from unthinkable angles.

1047
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,040
Chief of Kendo.

1048
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,240
He's fast as lightning,
powerful enough to split a rock.

1049
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,920
Our boxing chief.

1050
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,840
The impact of his right hook is 878 lbs.

1051
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,400
Our Judo chief.

1052
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,240
Best fighter for three years in a row.

1053
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,520
You're the one beaten by the masked man.

1054
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,520
Nice to meet you.

1055
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,640
The purpose of my trip from Japan

1056
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,880
is to restructure Elite Center.

1057
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,040
I think karate is the top martial art
in the world.

1058
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,280
That's why I think only karate

1059
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,040
should remain at Elite Center.
The others should be abolished.

1060
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:01,960
KARATE DIVISION

1061
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,360
-What do you mean by that?
-What about us?

1062
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,040
Good question! If you're interested,

1063
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,800
you're welcome to join
the karate division.

1064
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,520
I'll do the screening,

1065
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,160
because I only train the best,

1066
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,320
and not garbage.

1067
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,320
Why are you looking at me?
You think I'm garbage?

1068
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,400
Don't get me wrong!

1069
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,720
I'm saying you're all garbage.

1070
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,520
Son of a bitch!

1071
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,200
What a mess!

1072
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,160
What are you thinking?

1073
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,320
Let's burn the letter.

1074
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,080
I told you.

1075
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,800
They're all garbage.

1076
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,560
They should have been driven out!

1077
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:43,240
Where's the letter?
Good! It's still here, burn it!

1078
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,760
You cripple!
I have driven you out.

1079
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,840
How dare you show your face?

1080
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,840
I see.
You want money?

1081
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,240
I'll give you money and get lost.

1082
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,600
I'm telling you,
please don't treat me like a beggar.

1083
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,320
I'm no longer with the Center.

1084
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,800
I don't have to put up with you.

1085
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,480
I'm here today as Chief of the
Ancient Chinese Boxing school

1086
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,200
to challenge this karate chief to a duel.

1087
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:06,280
Are you out of your mind?

1088
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,760
1974, first time at the Southeast Asian
Kickboxing Championship

1089
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:11,280
and won first place.

1090
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,280
1980, defeated Japanese heavy champ,
Lei Long.

1091
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,000
For the next consecutive three years,

1092
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,040
defeated all Japanese Karate masters

1093
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,440
became Kickboxing Champion in Japan.

1094
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,720
Ancient Chinese Boxing,
hailed as the jinx of karate.

1095
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,280
He's nicknamed Devilish Muscle Man.

1096
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,200
What are you doing?

1097
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,640
That's right.

1098
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,440
This was the image of Devilish Muscle Man
back then.

1099
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,680
But too bad.
In the Sino-Japanese Championship in 1988,

1100
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,200
you disappeared after my
master broke your leg.

1101
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,480
Abandoned all hopes

1102
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:49,320
and resorted to swindling.

1103
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,560
You're now an aging cripple.

1104
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,480
How can you challenge anyone?

1105
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,040
Challenge?

1106
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,520
The challenger is not me, but him!

1107
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,880
The second-generation student
of Ancient Chinese Boxing,

1108
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,400
He Jin Yin.

1109
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,080
This piece of shit?

1110
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,520
Yes! Give me a month.

1111
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,160
I'll train him to be invincible!

1112
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,400
Only karate is invincible.

1113
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,000
As long as I'm alive,

1114
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,000
karate is always second to me.
Up for the challenge?

1115
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:17,480
Crazy.

1116
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,960
I accept your challenge, on one condition.

1117
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,400
If I win the challenge,

1118
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:23,640
Ancient Chinese Boxing
shall totally vanish from earth.

1119
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,880
All right! But if you lose,
I want Ancient Chinese Boxing

1120
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,840
to take over Elite Center.

1121
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,320
-You have a deal.
-One more thing.

1122
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,280
Mr. Manager, you took two bottles
of Indian Magic Oil the other day.

1123
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,440
Pay me back!

1124
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,680
Master, I didn't know you were for real.

1125
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,200
I told you fame is not my game.

1126
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,800
You shouldn't make
challenges on my behalf.

1127
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:40,960
You're killing me!

1128
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,320
I should thank you.

1129
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,760
If you didn't put a knife to my neck,

1130
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:46,720
I would never have realized
this is the best thing I've done.

1131
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,400
If we win,
I can re-establish Ancient Chinese Boxing.

1132
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:50,680
Even if you get killed,

1133
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,160
I'll take out an insurance policy
and be the beneficiary.

1134
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,680
Good for you, but what about me?

1135
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,120
You can prove you're not garbage.

1136
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,920
That's what I am, I won't deny it.

1137
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,920
-I have a plan.
-What plan?

1138
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,640
I haven't devised it yet.

1139
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,040
I better go.

1140
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,560
We'll work together some other time.

1141
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,680
Very well!

1142
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,840
What about the girl?

1143
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,800
Fine... I'll do it!

1144
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,640
That's the spirit!

1145
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,080
Look.

1146
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,000
The ratings for "Happy Tonight"
have reached record low.

1147
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,320
Do something! Say something!

1148
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,760
How about this?

1149
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,200
I read a story today
from the Elite Center magazine.

1150
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,720
-A suicide challenge.
-Are you serious?

1151
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,840
ANCIENT CHINESE BOXING VS. KARATE

1152
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,160
DELIVERY BOY'S SUICIDAL CHALLENGE
AGAINST KARATE CHIEF

1153
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,800
Happy Tonight is proud to present
the Happy Boxing Championship.

1154
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,000
The contestants include, on my right,

1155
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:39,240
student of the Ancient
Chinese Boxing school, the Delivery Boy.

1156
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,840
My name is He Jin Yin.

1157
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,480
I see, Delivery Boy has a nickname, Yin.

1158
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,880
On my left

1159
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,840
is karate champion
for three consecutive years,

1160
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,400
Chief Duan Shui Liu.

1161
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,520
They have signed a no-fault agreement.

1162
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,920
What brought about this duel?

1163
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,200
I don't know.

1164
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,080
Let's ask them.

1165
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,240
Mr. Delivery Boy,

1166
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,480
everyone says
it's suicidal for you.

1167
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,080
Can you tell us the reason

1168
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,680
behind this tragic decision?

1169
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,080
-Director, please look here.
-Look here, please.

1170
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,080
It is...

1171
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,040
Actually, I just wanted...

1172
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,320
It's unplugged, silly.

1173
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,000
Chief. Is this your first TV appearance?

1174
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,280
Yes.

1175
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,960
I'm allowing the live broadcast

1176
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:29,640
because I want to promote karate.

1177
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,640
Any event that promotes martial arts

1178
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,680
I will give my full support.

1179
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,560
Rumor has it
that you wore a Garfield mask

1180
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,280
and saved a girl.
Is that true?

1181
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,680
I showed up in disguise

1182
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,160
because I don't want people to know.

1183
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,600
Since everyone is interested,

1184
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,160
I can tell you.

1185
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,360
I grew up in Japan.

1186
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,120
Kamen Rider was my idol.

1187
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,720
From then on,

1188
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,760
I have used different masks

1189
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,720
to help the underdogs

1190
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,400
and punish the evil doers.

1191
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,920
It never dawned upon me

1192
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,360
that the person I saved that day

1193
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,480
would be the love of my life.

1194
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,080
He's talking about you.

1195
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,200
Li, I'm glad to see you again.

1196
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,920
I didn't expect my hero

1197
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,680
to show up at the right time and save me.

1198
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,440
It was so dangerous.

1199
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:26,920
If you didn't show up,

1200
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,640
I don't know what would have happened.

1201
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:29,960
I know it's been a while,

1202
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,920
but I still remember red
is your favorite color.

1203
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,440
You like black.

1204
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,480
You like red bean pudding.

1205
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:43,160
You like wasabi.

1206
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,560
How romantic!

1207
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:57,600
Flowers in bloom

1208
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:01,040
We pledge our love

1209
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:05,880
Nightingales sing

1210
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,280
Singing about our love

1211
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:16,800
Love is in the air

1212
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:23,160
We'll be together, never be apart

1213
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,560
Our love will never die

1214
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,160
I'm so happy today.

1215
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:32,440
Me too.

1216
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,760
Li, I'd like to take this opportunity
to propose.

1217
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,560
Please say yes.

1218
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,200
You're crying.

1219
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,520
There goes your girl!

1220
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,520
Let her go!

1221
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,640
What's wrong with you? Epilepsy?

1222
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,560
You're lying! You're a liar!

1223
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,440
You're a hypocrite!

1224
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,760
Don't believe him, Li.

1225
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,520
I saved you the other day.

1226
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,680
Step aside, Li.

1227
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,080
-What?
-You garbage!

1228
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,640
I'm giving you a chance to fight me,

1229
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,280
yet you repay me with slander.

1230
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,400
I'll show you no mercy in the ring.

1231
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:19,880
Me neither.

1232
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,360
I'll break your nose.

1233
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,200
I'll kill you.

1234
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:25,520
Excellent! Well said!

1235
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,800
This will be our headline tomorrow.

1236
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,840
Say that again.

1237
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,240
-I'll kill you.
-Excellent!

1238
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,320
SUICIDAL

1239
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:45,080
Bullshit. Delivery Boy isn't suicidal.

1240
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,200
And I'll measure up to my reputation.

1241
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:52,920
I'll show you in a month
what Ancient Chinese Boxing can do.

1242
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,480
A grueling training will start tomorrow.

1243
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,040
Let's go.

1244
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,920
Don't stand behind me,
this is not Brokeback Mountain.

1245
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,080
You said let's go.

1246
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,360
This way, asshole. No pictures.

1247
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,800
Sorry, excuse us.

1248
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:11,760
If you don't die after three rounds,
consider it a loss for me.

1249
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,040
I promise that after the competition,

1250
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,520
I'll still be standing.

1251
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,000
Wait! Let's take a few more.

1252
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,920
-Don't go just yet!
-Li, don't mind that lunatic!

1253
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,960
He's full of shit. Put on the ring.

1254
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,760
I think I can't...

1255
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,920
Why? You don't trust me?

1256
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I do, but...

1257
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,160
Whatever happens,

1258
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:35,080
let's go to my place tonight.
We need to talk, all right?

1259
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,320
Give me some time.

1260
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,640
-Vivian.
-Yes?

1261
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,960
-Let's go.
-Sure.

1262
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,440
Let's go.

1263
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,920
Can you really kill him?
Don't overpromise.

1264
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,160
Shut up!

1265
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,360
Ladies and gentlemen, we have news.

1266
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,880
The Devilish Muscle Man
has begun the grueling drill as we speak.

1267
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,160
We waste no time
in bringing you a live update.

1268
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,640
It's spooky and ghastly.

1269
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,400
Let's have a look around.

1270
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,720
-The fish balls are great!
-Really?

1271
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,920
Try it!

1272
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
-Well?
-Very bouncy.

1273
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,840
What about your grueling training?

1274
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,040
It is ongoing!

1275
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:46,480
-Have you eaten?
-No.

1276
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,600
-Take a seat.
-Come on, sit down!

1277
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,240
-More goose intestines?
-Do you like it?

1278
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:50,680
-Yes!
-Two more goose intestines, please!

1279
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,640
Are you filming us? We should get paid!

1280
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:56,440
-Where's my pork liver?
-At the bottom, I guess.

1281
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,120
No! I just put it in.

1282
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,480
-Did you eat it?
-No!

1283
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,240
-I swear.
-Don't give me that.

1284
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,080
-What's this?
-Why is the liver in my pocket?

1285
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,600
There's a limit to my patience.

1286
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,080
I see it...

1287
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,360
How's the drill?

1288
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,640
They're having hotpot.

1289
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Hotpot?

1290
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,080
Yes, they ordered goose intestines,

1291
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,320
a lot of fish balls
and hard boiled eggs.

1292
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,440
Allegedly it can reduce the loss of fluid.

1293
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,920
Let's have hotpot tonight
and try the eggs...

1294
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,120
Shut up!

1295
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,040
What are they up to?

1296
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,440
We have two more weeks to go.

1297
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,840
How is He Jin Yin
getting on with his training?

1298
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,000
Let's take a look.

1299
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,680
Don't run...

1300
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,600
They're really just fooling around!

1301
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:57,920
Either they have gone mad,

1302
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,480
or this is a conspiracy.

1303
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,360
I don't care what they're doing.

1304
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,640
I'll beat him.

1305
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:06,040
True love is hard to find

1306
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:09,360
My heart is fragile

1307
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:13,760
Looking for love...

1308
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:51,359
We'll just sit and observe.

1309
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:52,439
You don't really need me tonight, right?

1310
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,279
Says who?
I heard someone will be killed tonight.

1311
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:55,439
You better be prepared.

1312
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,359
-No way!
-Why not?

1313
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:01,279
When He Jin Yin goes down
and we rush him to the hospital,

1314
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,800
make sure you get close-ups of him.

1315
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,880
I want to see blood gushing out.

1316
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,000
What if he's dead?

1317
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,080
You'll get a raise, I'll get a promotion.

1318
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,479
We'll celebrate with a champagne. Yeah!

1319
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:14,920
In this match between David and Goliath,
will there be mercy?

1320
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:16,960
We'll do our best in the ring.

1321
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,920
The opponent's performance doesn't matter.

1322
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,760
Will you kill him by accident?

1323
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,800
No comment.

1324
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,680
Rumor has it you're pushing for death
to boost TV ratings, is that true?

1325
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,279
That's a lie, it's impossible.

1326
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:29,359
Your opponent seems ill prepared,
is this a ploy?

1327
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:31,200
Has he completed his training?

1328
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,720
What happens if you lose?

1329
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,120
With a body like yours,

1330
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:37,479
will you consider making a porn film?

1331
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,760
I will never do that!

1332
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,479
I'll only make martial arts films.

1333
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:46,000
Take it easy...

1334
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,800
Wait!

1335
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:49,840
Sorry...

1336
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,479
The world is full of morons.

1337
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,200
Those were stupid questions.

1338
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:55,560
How can we lose?

1339
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:57,200
It is obvious who will win...

1340
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:05,000
What is He Jin Yin up to?

1341
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,440
Are you all right?

1342
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,960
Where's Li? Is she here?

1343
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:13,320
Don't tell me you're scared... Not now.

1344
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,280
I put all my money on you.

1345
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,920
No, I better withdraw a few thousand...

1346
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:18,360
Who's afraid?

1347
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,520
Get ready, you're up in two minutes.

1348
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,600
Even though all of us

1349
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,480
bet on Duan Shui Liu to win,

1350
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,160
we're actually rooting for you.

1351
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,800
We made you a robe.
It took us all night.

1352
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,880
Thanks. Before I get in the ring,

1353
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,960
I'd like to see Li.

1354
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:45,000
I've already checked, she isn't here yet.

1355
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,400
Are you ready?

1356
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,160
Round one begins!

1357
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,160
I'm scared, Vivian.

1358
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,200
Don't be, there's still one more minute.

1359
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,240
-Perfect timing.
-I don't want them to fight.

1360
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,600
Aren't you rooting for Duan Shui Liu?

1361
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,000
No, I must tell Yin to forfeit.

1362
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,880
-What?
-What's going on?

1363
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,040
This can't be happening!

1364
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,360
-Are you serious? Not now!
-Don't do that.

1365
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:29,640
Anyone out there! Help!

1366
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:30,720
-Open up!
-Li!

1367
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,280
HAPPY BOXING CHAMPIONSHIP

1368
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,960
ANCIENT CHINESE BOXING

1369
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:52,720
The Happy Boxing Championship
now begins!

1370
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,080
First one out
is Japanese Karate expert, Duan Shui Liu,

1371
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,400
nicknamed The Killing Machine.

1372
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:01,760
Karate is about destruction,
and karate experts train

1373
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,480
every part of their bodies
to be destructive,

1374
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,480
with moves such as breaking ice,

1375
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,360
chopping wood,

1376
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:09,960
splitting tiles,

1377
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:10,920
and breaking bottles.

1378
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,520
Duan Shui Liu is particularly outstanding.

1379
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:14,680
His punch has enough power

1380
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,000
to smash a watermelon.

1381
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,520
That's right! Talk is cheap.

1382
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:22,120
Get your cameras ready
and see for yourself.

1383
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,760
Next up from
the Ancient Chinese Boxing school,

1384
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:28,240
Delivery Boy.
His master Devilish Muscle Man

1385
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,640
is the arch enemy of karate.

1386
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,400
According to our sources,
other than making a mean cup of tea,

1387
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,160
Delivery Boy hasn't learnt much kung fu.

1388
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,680
That's why this duel
was considered a suicidal attempt.

1389
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,120
What prompted him to do this
is still a mystery.

1390
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,120
MUST KILL

1391
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:44,360
From the ferocious look on his face,
he seems to have something up his sleeve.

1392
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,640
Now, it's an even greater mystery.

1393
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,600
-You're amazing. I'm backing you!
-Thank you, Auntie.

1394
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:51,200
Watch it! I bet all my money on you
that you'll go down in Round one.

1395
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,520
Please step down...

1396
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:53,920
Remember to go down in Round one.

1397
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,160
I'll do my best.

1398
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,520
Let's welcome our two contestants.

1399
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,760
They will carry on for three rounds.

1400
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,080
In case we can't take any pictures later,

1401
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:07,560
let's take a good one now
while they're both alive.

1402
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:08,880
Pose and say cheese!

1403
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,640
Good...

1404
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,560
This way.

1405
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:36,800
Votes from the press
are here in my hand.

1406
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,000
Delivery Boy wins the Best Costume Award.

1407
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,240
Now...

1408
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:47,000
Chief Duan Shui Liu will
give out the award.

1409
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,040
-Chief, smile for the camera.
-Congratulations.

1410
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,520
Smile! That's right.

1411
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,760
Thanks!

1412
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,280
The match will be gruesome.

1413
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,600
Mr. He deserves the award.
Let's take a picture.

1414
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,360
Looks like they are ready to go.

1415
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:21,080
Slaughter seems inevitable.

1416
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:26,840
The match has begun.

1417
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:29,000
Duan Shui Liu is like a tiger
out of a cage.

1418
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,640
They're fighting ferociously.
A punch after another...

1419
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:32,560
Hey...

1420
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:39,160
Why did he turn his back?

1421
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:49,640
Must be some trick.

1422
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:54,800
In terms of skill,
you're no match for him.

1423
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,360
What I'm teaching you

1424
01:14:56,440 --> 01:14:58,200
is the highest realm of
Ancient Chinese Boxing.

1425
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:01,160
Psychological warfare.
We'll wine and dine for a month.

1426
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:04,120
The merrier our parties,
the more he'll be suspicious.

1427
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,680
If you turn your back on him,

1428
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,840
I guarantee that for Round one,
he won't come near you.

1429
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:10,680
He's luring me over.

1430
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,360
But I shouldn't be afraid of him.

1431
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:13,600
I'll tough it out.

1432
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,640
Damn! Did he see through the trick?

1433
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,200
What are they doing?

1434
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,560
Say something, commentator!

1435
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:26,960
I can't comment if they don't move!

1436
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:29,760
Camera, focus on the commentator.
Make up something.

1437
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,600
If you get me fired, I'll kill you.

1438
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,960
-What can I say?
-Use this!

1439
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,120
The Dragon Saber?

1440
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:37,800
What's wrong with you? Keep talking!

1441
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,280
Come on! Hurry!

1442
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,480
-I can't believe this!
-Come on!

1443
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,880
The Lion King, no...

1444
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,720
Duan Shui Liu strikes
with Qi Shang Fist

1445
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,440
which is deadly.

1446
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,880
This is outrageous!

1447
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:52,640
I don't know what I'm saying!

1448
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,320
Just keep up the bullshit!

1449
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,560
Zhang Wu Ji... I mean Delivery Boy

1450
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:02,520
fights back with the Magic Move

1451
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:03,520
and dissipated the Qi Shang Fist.

1452
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,440
What? Magic Move?

1453
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:09,560
Delivery Boy bellowed
and begins to strike.

1454
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:11,400
Look how swiftly he's moving in the ring,

1455
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:15,240
Duan Shui Liu can't even tell
which one is the real Delivery Boy.

1456
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,160
He frowned and made up his mind.

1457
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,560
He took a step forward
with his left foot,

1458
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:22,680
and yelled out to his Master,

1459
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,640
summoning the dead to his assistance.

1460
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,000
Don't worry! I have another one.

1461
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,480
Duan Shui Liu fell
into Delivery Boy's arms.

1462
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,400
He closed his eyes.

1463
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,200
His tender lips slightly opened,

1464
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,000
breathing out... Jin Ping Mei?

1465
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,000
Don't worry... keep reading.

1466
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:48,280
-What is he talking about?
-He has fallen for him.

1467
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:53,520
Delivery Boy holds him at the waist,
and with his other hand,

1468
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:57,680
he feels the supple skin
around his tender chest.

1469
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,080
Duan Shui Liu can't take it anymore.

1470
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,600
-He feels that...
-Shut up!

1471
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,640
What the hell are you saying?

1472
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:07,080
I'm talking to you!

1473
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,200
You left me no choice.

1474
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:10,360
You weren't moving.

1475
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,000
How can we carry on the broadcast?

1476
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,600
Some reporter you are!
How the fuck do you run a show?

1477
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,040
How we run a show
is none of your business.

1478
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:16,600
-Idiot.
-Stop it.

1479
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:18,440
-Do me a favor, stop the yelling.
-Did you hear him? The fucking bastard...

1480
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,920
What the hell? I'm just doing my job.
How can you blame me?

1481
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,840
Forget it, stop arguing.

1482
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:24,400
Whose side are you on now?

1483
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:25,720
Time's up!

1484
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:27,440
End of Round one.

1485
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,160
Yeah...

1486
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:32,800
Are you all right?

1487
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,680
I'm scared! So scared.

1488
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,560
Don't worry!

1489
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,520
Chief.

1490
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,640
I know.

1491
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,000
He was tricking me by turning his back.

1492
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,840
I'll hit him from behind later.

1493
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:43,840
JUDGES

1494
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,320
This Delivery Boy is courageous.

1495
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,320
What are you up to now?

1496
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:16,640
Hey, isn't this a foul?

1497
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:19,160
He's tossing a hammer.
And a knife!

1498
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,760
So what? He's out of the ring.

1499
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,280
He might stab me.

1500
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:23,880
We'll deal with it when he does.

1501
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,760
The law will punish him.

1502
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,600
Just get on with the fight.

1503
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,080
It's so boring.

1504
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:35,840
If you get through Round one,
he'll get restless.

1505
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,720
In Round two, we'll go one step further.
Intimidate him.

1506
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,400
What's this? I'll kill you.

1507
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,720
See that! Duan Shui Liu is hit!

1508
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,680
It can't be true.
Referee, did you see that?

1509
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,560
Stay out of trouble, cripple!
Or I'll come down and get you.

1510
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,560
Don't blame me then!

1511
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,240
Duan Shui Liu is hit again!

1512
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:30,320
-Why doesn't he fight back?
-He's been kicked.

1513
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:36,760
Anything else? Give it!

1514
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,880
Can we cease now?

1515
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,480
Master! It seems I'm wounded.

1516
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,600
Don't worry, the durian is not poisonous.

1517
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:47,800
Damn!

1518
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,560
Commercial break! Clear the stage.

1519
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:01,720
Yang Yin Pill, warm like the sun

1520
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,840
Why is there no sound?

1521
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:06,120
Perhaps no battery.

1522
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,400
-Can't be!
-Are you trapped inside?

1523
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:11,120
Yes! What's wrong with you?
We've been in here for half an hour!

1524
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,000
Fine! We'll let you wait
another half an hour.

1525
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,920
No! Please let us out!

1526
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:20,920
-The sun is out...
-The sun is out...

1527
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,720
This is the last round.

1528
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,600
Kill him quickly.

1529
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,720
That'll only take a second.

1530
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,840
Look at that garbage!

1531
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,360
He's nothing! Everything is just an act!

1532
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:37,800
Don't say that!

1533
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,160
Every morning,

1534
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,200
I see him on a high speed truck

1535
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:43,320
swinging around like a lunatic.

1536
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,720
Could that be some special skill?

1537
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,480
Skill my ass! Get lost!

1538
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:49,960
He doesn't scare me!

1539
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:09,720
Is this a foul?

1540
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,320
Of course.

1541
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:14,320
This pose is obscene.
There are kids watching this show.

1542
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:18,920
Delivery Boy is clamped down by the chief.

1543
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,160
-You're mistaken.
-Delivery Boy is in control.

1544
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,040
Yin!

1545
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,680
Since your skills can't match his,

1546
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:32,280
the only way is to prevent him
from attacking you.

1547
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:37,080
I'll teach you the perfect defensive move
in Chinese boxing, the Clamp.

1548
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:39,360
We must practice with a truck.

1549
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:42,280
The key of this move can
be summarized with one word, lock!

1550
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:50,280
Lock him in position...

1551
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:10,880
Let go of me, garbage!

1552
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,240
I'm not garbage!

1553
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,720
Asshole!

1554
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:55,080
Let go!

1555
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:57,240
I can't take it anymore.

1556
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,800
I can't take it anymore.

1557
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,480
Don't run!

1558
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:05,360
Not again!

1559
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,240
You're the garbage!

1560
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:16,680
Yeah! Good work!

1561
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:18,080
Yeah...

1562
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,680
Be careful!

1563
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:27,880
Asshole!

1564
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,280
I'll get rid of you!

1565
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,160
Let go!

1566
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:38,040
Let go!

1567
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:39,600
Hold on, Delivery Boy!

1568
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:40,960
Don't let go!

1569
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,560
-Don't let go!
-Don't let go!

1570
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:51,720
Please let me go...

1571
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,080
Please look at the camera, Chief.

1572
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:57,520
Shut the hell up.

1573
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,040
I know how you feel.

1574
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,040
But I can't let go.

1575
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,880
Help!

1576
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,760
I can't do it anymore.

1577
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:33,160
Full power lethal kick.

1578
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,160
Round three is over!

1579
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,160
I'm alive!

1580
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,960
After three rounds, he's still standing.
It's a miracle!

1581
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,520
He's like Rocky!

1582
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,360
You did well, Chief!

1583
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,280
I'm so happy!

1584
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:56,440
What are you?

1585
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:59,160
After three rounds,
the judges have come to a consensus.

1586
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:01,480
Duan Shui Liu is the winner!

1587
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:08,200
I bet with all my money that he'd die,
but you didn't kill him. What the hell!

1588
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,440
Hooray…

1589
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,880
I thought you'd really kill him.

1590
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,160
You're not that good after all.

1591
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:27,800
I must sing a song
to thank everyone for their support.

1592
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,840
A real hero...

1593
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:33,400
Hurry! It's him over there!

1594
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:35,800
Yin!

1595
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,840
Please sing with me!

1596
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,840
Li!

1597
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:41,840
Yin!

1598
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,360
Li!

1599
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,560
This time I must kiss you.

1600
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,680
-I'm wounded.
-My teeth have been knocked out.

1601
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:49,240
Give me a kiss too.

1602
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,360
Li, I'm alive.

1603
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,160
I'm so relieved!

1604
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:55,560
Actually...

1605
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,160
-What?
-You garbage!

1606
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:02,720
Bluffing me with tricks.

1607
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,320
Of all the fights I've done,
none of my opponents can stand up.

1608
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,640
You're no exception.

1609
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,840
I must kill you tonight!

1610
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,240
Where are you going?

1611
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:11,600
Why don't you congratulate me?

1612
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:13,400
I told you to stay away
from that garbage.

1613
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,240
What? You hit me?

1614
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,240
Stop!

1615
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:18,960
You already won, leave him alone!

1616
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,200
How dare you
have no respect for me?

1617
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:31,800
Come back, He Jin Yin!

1618
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:35,240
Don't get carried away.
There's always someone stronger.

1619
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,200
He Jin Yin has a good strategy.

1620
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,800
You should admit defeat.

1621
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:44,000
You've won and yet you want
to destroy him.

1622
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:46,280
That's too much!

1623
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:48,120
Whoever disapproves me,
I dare you to fight me.

1624
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,120
Members of Eagle Claw, get up!

1625
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:53,400
EAGLE CLAW SECT

1626
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,480
BA GUA SECT
WHITE CRANE AND BA GUA

1627
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:00,280
Fine! I'll take you on!

1628
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:02,640
I'll show you what
the Killing Machine looks like.

1629
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,000
Charge...

1630
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:10,160
-This is ridiculous!
-What's ridiculous?

1631
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:11,640
Quickly get a taxi and go home.

1632
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,400
-We won't fit.
-Five of us will fit just right.

1633
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,200
-Yes...
-Are you all right, Yin?

1634
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,240
I'm fine.

1635
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:18,000
Now there are six.
Boss, you're on your own!

1636
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,080
Hey...

1637
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,520
Director, are you all right?

1638
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,560
Kid.

1639
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,600
-Be forgiving...
-Shut up.

1640
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:36,920
Do we stop filming?

1641
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:40,720
Are you crazy? I've been waiting all night
for action like this.

1642
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,520
Go according to plan.

1643
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,720
Get ready for lucky draw.

1644
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:47,880
Don't be silly.

1645
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:49,240
You're no match for him.

1646
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,360
There's one last thing...
Get me a ladder.

1647
01:27:58,280 --> 01:27:59,800
How many times have I told you?

1648
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,040
There's no such
thing as Invincible Fireball.

1649
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,080
I know I'm right.

1650
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:04,480
Even if you are,
where can you find the ladder?

1651
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,040
-I found it.
-Where?

1652
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:07,200
Here.

1653
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:10,480
Is it too long?

1654
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,520
Ladies and gentlemen...

1655
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,720
Last but not least...

1656
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,440
Lucky Wheel lucky draw.

1657
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:26,200
Lucky draw?

1658
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,800
I wish I'll win.

1659
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:29,960
Yes...

1660
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,920
Lucky draw?
Let's play with the lucky wheel.

1661
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:34,240
Yin!

1662
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,080
Let go!

1663
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:46,760
Come out, He Jin Yin!

1664
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,440
Here I am! Come here.

1665
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,360
Let's see who's garbage now!

1666
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,280
Come on, garbage!
I dare you to fight me.

1667
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:00,280
Invincible Fireball.

1668
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,000
-Yin...
-Don't...

1669
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,240
-Yin...
-Run!

1670
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:00,320
Are you OK?

1671
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:14,240
You can't beat me so easily.
Karate is invincible.

1672
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,600
You'll always be garbage.

1673
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:18,280
You're garbage! Garbage!

1674
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:20,920
Save your breath. Quit the act.

1675
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,040
You saw through me. I admit it...

1676
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:31,200
You won!

1677
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:34,600
Incredible!

1678
01:30:34,680 --> 01:30:36,800
But you broke the Lucky Wheel.
You must pay for it!

1679
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,200
Incredible!

1680
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:41,080
-Where did you learn that?
-From my master.

1681
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:43,040
No! He invented it!

1682
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:46,440
You're a true warrior.

1683
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,960
I was right about you. I'm so proud!

1684
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:51,840
Thanks to you, Master.

1685
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,200
Don't say that!

1686
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:56,680
I seek no publicity.
I'm the Devilish Muscle Man.

1687
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,400
When Yin first came to me,

1688
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,640
he was a fool.

1689
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,440
If I hadn't...

1690
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,120
-Move...
-Hey!

1691
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:04,720
Mr. Delivery Boy.

1692
01:31:04,840 --> 01:31:06,760
You did a great thing for the people.

1693
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:09,080
It's my duty as a citizen.

1694
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,840
Doing charity work is my interest.

1695
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:12,360
I help old ladies cross the street.

1696
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:13,680
-Really?
-I do that once a week.

1697
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:14,880
On public holidays,

1698
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,240
I even do it two or three times.

1699
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:19,840
Listen, it's because
he ate the pineapple rice at Wing Kee.

1700
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:21,600
There are real pineapples in it.

1701
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:23,320
Our meat ball soup is the real shit.

1702
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:24,480
I bet you don't believe me.

1703
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:26,600
Niu, show us some shit.

1704
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,720
-Stop messing around here!
-What are you doing?

1705
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:34,240
-Tell us, what are your plans?
-Me?

1706
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,480
What I want the most
is for Li to accompany me to see

1707
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,320
Leon Lai's concert tomorrow night.

1708
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,560
I went through great trouble
to get the tickets.

1709
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,400
Li? Where are you?

1710
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,120
Li...

1711
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:48,840
Li.

1712
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,280
-Take a picture.
-Hurry...

1713
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,800
Li, I want to...

1714
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:00,000
Shut up and kiss me!
