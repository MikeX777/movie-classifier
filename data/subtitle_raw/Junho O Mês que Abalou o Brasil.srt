00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:18,011
This film was produced
without public resources.

2
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:21,135
[The month of June begins with]
[a lot of humidity]

3
00:00:21,367 --> 00:00:23,200
[in most parts of the country.]

4
00:00:27,005 --> 00:00:34,014
[I declare officially open the FIFA]
[Confederations Cup 2013.]

5
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:40,472
[As from tomorrow, bus and subway]
[tickets will become more expensive.]

6
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:44,469
[In São Paulo, the bus,]
[subway and train tickets...]

7
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:48,333
[...will go from R$ 3,00]
[to R$ 3,20, as from today.]

8
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:49,376
[Goal! Brazil!]

9
00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:51,012
[The protesters]
[are walking around...]

10
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:55,067
[If the fares don’t go down...]
[Ole, ole, ola...]

11
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:06,370
[This coverage was the winner]
[of the Esso Award 2013]

12
00:01:13,867 --> 00:01:14,870
[It’s just wonderful.]

13
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:17,667
[It makes you want to kill yourself,]
[commit suicide...]

14
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:20,274
[Just jump on the rails,]
[it’s easier.]

15
00:01:24,005 --> 00:01:30,007
[The buses take long time to arrive,]
[the amount of people inside...]

16
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:32,740
[I can never get a seat, I never travel]
[seated when I take the bus.]

17
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:35,471
[Depending on the bus,]
[I think it’s really shitty.]

18
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,018
[Excuse the word...]
[But it’s the chaos.]

19
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:45,300
[Regarding the urban trains,]
[we do suffer.]

20
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,567
[Considering it’s the year]
[of the World Cup in Brazil,]

21
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,573
[we’d think there would be]
[some investments,]

22
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:51,239
[but it’s not the case.]

23
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:54,733
[None of the politicians are brave]
[enough to leave their cars]

24
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:56,833
[and take the public transportation,]

25
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,333
[and be there with the people,]
[in the heat, sweating.]

26
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:02,370
[I believe the fare,]
[either R$3,20 or R$3,00,]

27
00:02:02,007 --> 00:02:04,340
[is too expensive]
[for what is offered.]

28
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:06,571
[It’s out of the question.]

29
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:11,069
[I hope this will change some day.]

30
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:13,200
[I’ll die dreaming,]

31
00:02:13,003 --> 00:02:17,336
[I don’t know if my generation will be]
[here to see this change.]

32
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:31,670
[Haddad, you asshole,]
[bring the bus fare down!]

33
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:33,007
[It’s too expensive!]

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,733
[It’s R$ 0,20...]

35
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:43,100
[...making the businessmen]
[richer and richer.]

36
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:47,800
Watch out, because
the Crazy-men Party will emerge!

37
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:12,833
JUNE

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,833
[Come out to the streets!]
[Come against the raise!]

39
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:21,000
[The MPL, Free Pass Movement,]
[is a social movement, horizontal,]

40
00:04:21,033 --> 00:04:22,036
[autonomous, disconnected]
[to political parties,]

41
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:24,833
[that fights for a truly public]
[transportation model.]

42
00:04:24,867 --> 00:04:27,633
[The movement started]
[with the popular uprisings]

43
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,833
that happened especially
in Salvador and Florianópolis,

44
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:33,133
against the raise of bus fares.

45
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:37,233
[The rebellions in Florianópolis,]
[which were known as “Fare Wars”,]

46
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:39,433
[achieved victory]
[for 2 years in a roll.]

47
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:42,133
[The people on the streets]
[revoked the fare from rising.]

48
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,600
[And in 2005,]
[at the World Social Forum,]

49
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:48,700
[several cities that were impelling]
[fights for public transportation]

50
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:51,100
[got together and created]
[a social movement]

51
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:54,600
that could represent
all these fights.

52
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:55,637
It was the Free Pass Movement.

53
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:59,074
The organizations such as
the Free Pass Movement

54
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:03,741
aren’t primarily directed
towards the State.

55
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:07,933
[They talk about the society,]
[to the society itself.]

56
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,533
That’s groundbreaking.

57
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:14,573
The MPL declares itself
to be anti-capitalism.

58
00:05:15,002 --> 00:05:19,569
The movement is not really interested
in the topic of urban mobility.

59
00:05:20,002 --> 00:05:24,769
For them, urban mobility is an excuse
to build a revolution, that’s curious...

60
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,133
I know them because many
are students at our university.

61
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:34,167
[It seems to me they act]
[very intelligently.]

62
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:40,539
Instead of presenting general agendas
in their political discussions,

63
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:44,000
[like the end of capitalism]
[or topics of this nature,]

64
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:47,037
[they aim towards a specific symptom,]

65
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:50,967
a symptom that shows
the system’s irrationality.

66
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,067
[This...]

67
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:55,433
[...is the third great act...]

68
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:57,233
TUESDAY, JUNE 11TH

69
00:05:57,267 --> 00:05:59,272
[that will stop the city.]

70
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:03,333
[It’s not only São Paulo]

71
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:05,770
[that is fighting]

72
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,235
[against the fare increase.]

73
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:12,975
[I started covering]
[the protests on Tuesday,]

74
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:15,833
[the first day]
[of protests this week.]

75
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:20,833
And I saw very different
groups of people.

76
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:23,400
There were some people connected
to political parties

77
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:26,267
and others who were there protesting
because they identified with the cause.

78
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:27,636
[Why are you here protesting?]

79
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:30,833
I can’t find a reason
not to be here, actually.

80
00:06:30,867 --> 00:06:34,876
It’s amazing that everyone
is finally coming to the streets

81
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:38,300
[and is protesting for their rights,]

82
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:42,467
[which will only come when]
[there is pressure from the people.]

83
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:44,838
This is the State’s responsibility,
it is written on the bus itself.

84
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:49,200
There are ways to achieve, at least,
the free tickets for the students,

85
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:51,236
and then, afterwards,
the total gratuity in transportation.

86
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:57,800
I’m surprised society thinks a protest
in favor of a public cause is strange.

87
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,300
Everyone is paying for this increase,
including the police.

88
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:03,600
I have a car and I’m here.

89
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:05,167
I think everybody should be here.

90
00:07:05,002 --> 00:07:08,008
Because cars generate
a lot of traffic,

91
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,667
and car owners wouldn’t use their cars
if public transportation were good.

92
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:14,574
The first arrest done
at the demonstration on Tuesday

93
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:16,736
[happened right next to me.]

94
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:20,009
[He was a cyclist, who crossed a lane]
[the police was trying to clear]

95
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:21,937
[for vehicles use exclusively.]

96
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:26,372
[He was thrown on the grass]
[by six officers.]

97
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:30,033
Oh, my God!

98
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:33,700
Oh, my God!

99
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:41,600
[Many protesters didn’t want violence]
[and never attacked the police.]

100
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:45,500
But a few people at the front

101
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:48,542
[led an attack against the officers.]

102
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:52,500
[The police struck back]
[and they engaged in conflict,]

103
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:56,239
especially when the protesters arrived
at the Terminal Parque Dom Pedro.

104
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:02,834
It’s interesting to analyze
the police repression on Tuesday.

105
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:07,300
[Because the act was very peaceful until]
[we got to Terminal Parque Dom Pedro.]

106
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,867
[And we have entered]
[the Terminal Parque Dom Pedro]

107
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,376
[in other occasions]
[over the past years.]

108
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:23,773
We agreed on a specific route
with the movement’s leadership.

109
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,471
[But they didn’t]
[follow the agreement,]

110
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:28,017
because there isn’t really
a leadership unity,

111
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:32,010
there are many people presenting
themselves as leaders of the movement.

112
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:35,200
The shock troops surrounded
the Terminal Parque Dom Pedro

113
00:08:35,233 --> 00:08:36,236
and didn’t let us inside.

114
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:40,333
[A very strong repression started]
[and the people got very motivated]

115
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:43,733
[by the fight and didn’t want]
[to simply go back home.]

116
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:47,333
They talked about anarchic-punks,
but those who were there

117
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:49,374
knew it was actually
the Black Block.

118
00:08:53,006 --> 00:09:00,839
I frankly don’t know how associated
they were with the MPL.

119
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:03,033
But they were there.

120
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:08,175
The Black Block is a tactic;
it’s not a political group.

121
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,033
[This new tactic puts a question:]
[What is more legitimate,]

122
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:17,500
the violence against people,
committed by the police,

123
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:20,276
[or the destruction of public]
[and private properties?]

124
00:09:21,006 --> 00:09:28,439
On that day, some had masks
on and wore black,

125
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:33,000
[and they knew about]
[the history in Seattle, Genova.]

126
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:37,041
[They knew the anarchic-punk strategy,]
[especially the anarchist one,]

127
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:40,872
[which was applied that day.]

128
00:09:42,002 --> 00:09:43,369
Our tactic force had to act,
precisely,

129
00:09:43,006 --> 00:09:46,739
because they were attacking police
officers at the Parque Dom Pedro.

130
00:09:57,002 --> 00:09:59,008
We negotiated with the police
when we were at Paulista avenue,

131
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:04,467
trying to hold back the repressions
like the ones that had already happened;

132
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:05,011
a lot of people were hurt.

133
00:10:06,003 --> 00:10:07,236
[Everything was going well.]

134
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:10,568
[We got to Paulista avenue without]
[any sort of complications]

135
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:11,575
[among the protesters.]

136
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:15,871
[But the police clearly set an ambush]
[waiting for us at the MASP.]

137
00:10:16,003 --> 00:10:17,836
[We were supposed to close]
[the act at MASP,]

138
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:20,176
[but they started to shoot and throw]
[bombs before we could get to MASP.]

139
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:23,234
And then it happened,
what everybody already saw.

140
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:26,400
[You'll have to throw bombs]
[all night long!]

141
00:10:43,233 --> 00:10:48,767
I believe what is happening
is a historically know phenomenon,

142
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:50,016
but which has huge singularities.

143
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:53,200
There is a mismatch
between the citizens

144
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:55,367
and the institutions
that represent them.

145
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:58,270
Everyone has the right to reunite
in a public place

146
00:10:58,006 --> 00:10:59,015
without needing
someone’s authorization.

147
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:01,942
Isn’t it your job to see
that the law is followed?

148
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:03,900
Yes.

149
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:05,500
Is the law being followed now?

150
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:07,535
You are keeping the citizens
from coming and going;

151
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:11,733
you are throwing
tear gas bombs on people.

152
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:12,900
Is this justice?

153
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:16,275
What if it was your
son marching here?

154
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:20,467
-Would you throw a bomb on him?
-I don’t know.

155
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:25,367
All that I know is that you people
have set buses on fire,

156
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:28,840
broken vehicles, hurt officers,
written on buses...

157
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:31,933
-Did I set fire on buses?
-I don’t know. I don’t know.

158
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,900
Must I pay for somebody
else’s crimes?

159
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:38,467
But that’s what you’re telling me.
You are justifying your actions.

160
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:41,567
Should I pay for
the crime of someone else?

161
00:11:41,006 --> 00:11:44,273
I was hit with a bomb
in the face, you coward!

162
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,342
There was a sort of guide
on the Internet,

163
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:54,934
explaining how to cope with
the tear gas, something like that.

164
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:58,967
And it became viral on the Internet

165
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,233
that the best way to deal with
tear gas was to use vinegar.

166
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:06,800
[Vinegar.]

167
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,933
[Vinegar is the new Anthrax]

168
00:12:11,006 --> 00:12:12,973
[Vinegar]

169
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,976
[Vinegar is the new Anthrax]

170
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:20,576
He was holding a substance
that he claims to be vinegar.

171
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:23,010
It will pass by the police
inspection for confirmation.

172
00:12:24,033 --> 00:12:27,033
[The vinegar became a joke.]

173
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:30,068
Being arrested before even
getting to the protests,

174
00:12:30,002 --> 00:12:33,003
because you are holding vinegar,
doesn’t seem to make sense.

175
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:34,933
Vinegar.

176
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:36,967
You can stand right there
with your hands back!

177
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,633
[What?]
[Am I being arrested?]

178
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:40,671
Stand right there
with your hands back!

179
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:44,002
[Vinegar is the new Anthrax]

180
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:49,169
It’s easier to make people cry
a little with some tear gas

181
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:52,013
then to be in a situation like that,
which everybody saw, including Folha.

182
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,900
A police officer in the position
of maybe killing someone,

183
00:12:55,933 --> 00:12:56,934
[because he was attacked]
[by a bunch of people]

184
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,333
[and he was carrying]
[a 40 caliber pistol,]

185
00:12:58,367 --> 00:12:59,600
[which is not the proper weapon.]

186
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:00,642
[He shouldn’t even have]
[been alone at that place.]

187
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:06,933
[Stop! Stop!]

188
00:13:10,004 --> 00:13:13,437
Go on ahead!
Lead the march ahead!

189
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:18,000
Brazil only had two big movements,
at the most,

190
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:21,036
which were the “Diretas Já”,
Direct Elections Now,

191
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,200
[and the impeachment of president Collor,]
[both were big public manifestations.]

192
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:27,238
But the country doesn’t have a tradition
of public manifestations.

193
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:31,774
If you take France, for example,
there is a tradition that lasts.

194
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:35,234
If the French destroy
subway stations in France

195
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:36,369
they’re doing it for the cause.

196
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:39,007
If people break subway stations
at Paulista avenue,

197
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,500
they are seen as lazybones, who don’t
want anything to do with work...

198
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:45,367
Maybe if we were French, we would be
fancier and be called activists.

199
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:46,471
This is interesting.

200
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:52,014
Let’s look at the guidelines
of protests around the world.

201
00:13:53,433 --> 00:13:57,867
[Chile: 400 thousand people]
[on the streets asking for free,]

202
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:59,016
[quality public education.]

203
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:05,100
[Israel, Tel-Aviv: they asked]
[the State to regulate]

204
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,900
[the costs on habitation.]

205
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:10,739
[Spain, the Indignants:]
[true democracy]

206
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:16,375
[and the chance to oppose]
[the economic system]

207
00:14:17,002 --> 00:14:18,011
[that was destroying the country.]

208
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:26,500
[Tunisia and Egypt: besides the ideas]
[of democracy and dignity,]

209
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:30,541
[it was also about a well-fare State]
[that doesn’t exist in those countries.]

210
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:34,633
[All of these movements asked for]
[something very clearly:]

211
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,233
more democracy.

212
00:14:36,004 --> 00:14:39,271
THURSDAY, JUNE 13TH

213
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:42,872
[Come out to the streets!]
[Come against the raise!]

214
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:56,374
[Hands over your head!]
[R$ 3,20 is a robbery!]

215
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:00,133
[On Thursday it was]
[a completely different scenario.]

216
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:01,475
When we left
to do this coverage,

217
00:15:02,003 --> 00:15:04,970
we had already read some
statements by the police,

218
00:15:05,003 --> 00:15:10,036
saying the demonstrators
wouldn’t be left so comfortable

219
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,367
to protest like they wanted to.

220
00:15:28,004 --> 00:15:31,006
Many people were arrested.
Look over there.

221
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:35,016
-They got Luisa!
-Where?

222
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:37,667
Over there.

223
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:39,073
Let me go!

224
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:45,236
Go back! Go back!

225
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:50,800
My friend is there!
My work colleague is there.

226
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:53,200
All we are looking for
is our rights!

227
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,933
And these shitheads wearing
uniforms keep hitting us!

228
00:15:56,967 --> 00:15:59,500
They aimed the fucking
pepper spray in my eye!

229
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:07,067
[They walked from the Municipal]
[Theater to Consolação street,]

230
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,833
where the conflict began.

231
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,007
Actually, it wasn’t a conflict;

232
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:13,600
it was more like a massacre
coming from the police.

233
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:28,500
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

234
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:29,767
What happened to you, Ma’am?

235
00:16:29,008 --> 00:16:30,941
-How old are you?
-67.

236
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,867
-What’s your name?
-Maria Bernadete.

237
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:39,174
-Tell me, Dona Maria, what happened?
-I was shot with a rubber bullet.

238
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:42,014
They are going to shoot
in this direction.

239
00:16:43,433 --> 00:16:47,300
I will file a police report.

240
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:55,500
The movement said they
would stop at Roosevelt square,

241
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:57,267
but that’s not what happened.

242
00:16:57,967 --> 00:17:00,500
Thursday was pure brutality.

243
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,667
Cowards!

244
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:09,014
Murderers!

245
00:17:10,433 --> 00:17:12,467
Cowards!

246
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:13,633
Stay here,
because here is safe.

247
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:15,800
Safe?

248
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:17,641
It’s safe.
São Paulo is a safe city.

249
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:30,800
During the entire time, on Thursday,
I saw the police hitting people,

250
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,867
shooting, throwing bombs towards
people who were shouting:

251
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:34,076
“No violence!”

252
00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:41,900
I was surrendered,
you son of a bitch!

253
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,333
I was surrendered!
I was surrendered!

254
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:50,600
I was surrendered,
you piece of shit!

255
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:02,633
Giu, was shot
in the eye, man!

256
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,500
-Who?
-Giu.

257
00:18:09,008 --> 00:18:12,075
We were walking up Augusta street
when we ran into the shock troops.

258
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I just stood there,

259
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:16,041
I was wearing my identification
from Folha around my neck,

260
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:19,300
I didn’t have my cell phone
because it ran out of battery,

261
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,240
and I didn’t say
a word to any of them.

262
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:27,633
[Then a shock officer stepped]
[ahead of the others,]

263
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:30,670
who were holding shields,
and pointed his gun at me.

264
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,933
[That had happened]
[several times that day,]

265
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:34,800
[so I didn’t really think]
[he’d shoot me.]

266
00:18:35,008 --> 00:18:36,041
But he shot.

267
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,467
[Did you see]
[him aiming at you?]

268
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:42,672
I saw it.
I saw him aiming at me,

269
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:44,010
but I never thought
he would shoot.

270
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:48,367
Because they had aimed
at me before that evening,

271
00:18:48,005 --> 00:18:49,007
but no one had shot.

272
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:53,767
I was there doing my job.
And I am a woman...

273
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,375
I could never have imagined
that a uniformed policeman

274
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:57,006
would shoot me in the face.

275
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:11,773
Our police force is well-built.

276
00:19:12,004 --> 00:19:16,571
The police force was destabilized
by the lack of communication

277
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,133
[with this group.]

278
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:19,172
We were surrounded.

279
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:22,874
At a certain moment,
when we got to Consolação street,

280
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:27,935
I remember looking to one side
and there was the shock troop,

281
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,174
at the other side
there was the cavalry troop,

282
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:32,276
looking ahead
there were bombs coming.

283
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:37,009
The order was disrupted, therefore
the series of police interventions.

284
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:40,442
Fucking rich kid.

285
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:44,300
Shut up! Shut up!

286
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:47,633
[From day one,]
[we had many protesters arrested.]

287
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:49,674
[Many protesters who were]
[simply walking in the streets]

288
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:51,867
were taken to the police station

289
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:53,342
and charged with crimes
they hadn’t committed.

290
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:57,300
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-What did he do?

291
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,333
He assaulted the troops.
Excuse me.

292
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:13,600
In Brazil, the public system
is totally under-prepared.

293
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:18,267
Schools, hospitals...
The police couldn’t be different.

294
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:20,013
Stop right there!
Stop!

295
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,335
Get back!

296
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:25,133
Get back and wait!

297
00:20:26,006 --> 00:20:32,139
[You can see by their reaction]
[they didn’t receive proper training.]

298
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:35,775
Their nervous reaction
doesn’t make sense.

299
00:20:37,006 --> 00:20:38,012
You can see they’re under prepared.

300
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:47,015
[Maybe they’re “well-prepared”]
[when no one is watching,]

301
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:52,536
when they are in the suburbs
and you can’t see what they’re doing.

302
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:56,900
What you saw here is the same thing
that happens every day

303
00:20:57,008 --> 00:20:58,541
[with groups]
[that aren’t middle class.]

304
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:02,742
It’s the same thing, but this time
the middle class was filming.

305
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:06,233
These fuckers are filming us.

306
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:12,334
[If you have records]
[of this kind of behavior,]

307
00:21:12,008 --> 00:21:19,675
it surely doesn’t reflect the attitude
of most officers

308
00:21:20,005 --> 00:21:24,572
who were at the marches
of the Free Pass Movement.

309
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:30,800
[The State Government,]
[the shock troop,]

310
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:34,400
the police, they all clearly
attempted to checkmate the movement

311
00:21:34,433 --> 00:21:37,867
and tried to stop people from going
to the streets at any cost.

312
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,340
This movement
is organized by whom?

313
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:48,033
By a tiny little group of vandals,
whose actions are clearly criminal.

314
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:49,072
Are they linked
to a political party?

315
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:53,439
We must investigate
to verify what’s the origin.

316
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:01,639
Tomorrow there will be more!

317
00:22:02,007 --> 00:22:03,740
Tomorrow there will be
a lot more!

318
00:22:05,133 --> 00:22:06,138
Tomorrow there will be more!

319
00:22:07,767 --> 00:22:10,900
Tomorrow there will be
a lot more!

320
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:15,006
On that week,
the media played a role

321
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:20,900
as important as the violence
from the police,

322
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,006
in terms of creating outrage.

323
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:29,767
The press reflected the huge indignation
the public opinion

324
00:22:29,008 --> 00:22:30,441
developed towards
minority movements.

325
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,133
We’ve gotten used to minority movements
in the last ten years.

326
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:37,172
Any 50 people can stop Paulista avenue
if they are labeled as “social movement”.

327
00:22:37,007 --> 00:22:42,340
That’s a way of making the city
hostage of organized groups.

328
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:45,600
I think the editorials
of Folha and Estado de São Paulo,

329
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:48,500
on the next day,
will become historical,

330
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:53,900
considering the repercussions
they caused.

331
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:59,500
They were demanding more repression,
saying the State was being weak,

332
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:01,840
affirming Paulista avenue
should be taken back.

333
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:06,233
Well, the press demanded things
to be done the right way,

334
00:23:06,267 --> 00:23:08,500
and the police translated it
on their own terms.

335
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:11,800
The translation was
“Now, it is our time to play”.

336
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:15,142
Then, when the police started to play,
the public opinion became revolted,

337
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:19,073
and this was also
reflected by journalism.

338
00:23:19,007 --> 00:23:22,040
I think journalism and the public
opinion have walked side by side.

339
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:25,200
The media accepted the situation;

340
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:26,239
because there was no way
it could go on denying

341
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:30,433
that the movement
was taking huge proportions.

342
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,010
The media could
no longer be against it.

343
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:39,500
But they supported the movement in a
way that wouldn’t hurt their interests.

344
00:23:39,967 --> 00:23:42,333
That’s exactly
what Arnaldo Jabor did.

345
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:46,367
One day he said it was vandalism,
it was abominable...

346
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:51,772
They are the violent imitation,
of a 50’s socialism imitation,

347
00:23:52,003 --> 00:23:54,636
that the ancient
left still stands for.

348
00:23:54,967 --> 00:24:00,333
This middle class insurgents
aren’t even worth R$ 0,20.

349
00:24:00,007 --> 00:24:01,012
And the other day he says

350
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:04,767
“It’s great that
they’re out on the streets”.

351
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:08,441
At first sight, this movement
seemed like a pointless provocation,

352
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:12,533
that many were mistaken
to criticize, including me.

353
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:17,733
I don’t think the press was mistaken
in neither of the two opinions

354
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:19,233
that were adopted.

355
00:24:19,005 --> 00:24:20,038
At the first moment,

356
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:24,033
the press wasn’t asking for violence
towards peaceful protesters.

357
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:25,070
And at the second moment,

358
00:24:25,004 --> 00:24:34,006
the media was right to denounce
the absurd violence of the police.

359
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:38,167
Are you going
to put Datena on the film?

360
00:24:38,002 --> 00:24:40,135
Wasn’t our question clear?

361
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:42,373
“Are you in favor
of protests with riots?”.

362
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:45,400
That would be a better way
to put the question.

363
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:49,440
2.839 people said they are
in favor of this kind of protesting.

364
00:24:50,933 --> 00:24:51,967
It’s very interesting,

365
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,003
because these anchormen are normally
addicted to public opinion.

366
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,342
The viewer that calls us is seeing
everything calm in the image;

367
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:07,233
he may misinterpret the question.
Ask the question like a suggested.

368
00:25:07,433 --> 00:25:08,438
They don’t go against
the public opinion.

369
00:25:08,967 --> 00:25:10,833
If the audience wants to know
about the police,

370
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:12,333
they’ll talk about the police.

371
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:15,700
When Datena started seeing there was
another side to the history,

372
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:17,736
he was smart enough to...

373
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:22,700
I can tell the people are so angry
about the ticket fare increase;

374
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:26,735
it doesn’t matter if it’s the bus,
the subway, the train.

375
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:30,733
People are so angry they will
support any kind of protest.

376
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:34,775
If the media hadn’t changed sides
after June 13th

377
00:25:35,006 --> 00:25:36,639
and hadn’t convoked the entire
country to participate,

378
00:25:37,267 --> 00:25:40,300
MPL wouldn’t
have achieved victory.

379
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:44,467
I noticed it by the people
in my everyday life,

380
00:25:44,006 --> 00:25:47,039
colleagues from work,
who up to that moment

381
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:49,672
only talked
about the vandalism.

382
00:25:50,002 --> 00:25:52,869
I couldn’t tell them
I was participating in the marches.

383
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:56,174
I always managed a way to go,
but I couldn’t tell them.

384
00:25:57,007 --> 00:26:04,010
After June 13th, I mentioned I had gone
to a march and it was suddenly cool.

385
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:13,567
[What you see there is the vehicle]
[of Record network on fire.]

386
00:26:13,667 --> 00:26:19,600
[You’d tell me is the destruction]
[of the network’s assets.]

387
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:25,173
[But I see it differently;]
[I think it’s a great sign.]

388
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:30,472
[Come out to the streets!]
[Come against the raise!]

389
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,667
[No violence!]
[No violence!]

390
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:48,433
[There is something very new,]
[which already became very common.]

391
00:26:48,007 --> 00:26:52,240
It’s the power new medias
have on convoking people.

392
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:55,333
[That’s very new]

393
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:57,533
[and it’s extremely important.]

394
00:27:05,267 --> 00:27:06,270
[In São Paulo, the turning point]
[was in a moment]

395
00:27:06,006 --> 00:27:10,013
[when there was criminalization]
[against the movement.]

396
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,334
The movement peacefully
took the streets,

397
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:17,467
the journalists and protesters
were severely hit by the police.

398
00:27:17,005 --> 00:27:20,005
[And the society got to see that,]
[it ran the social networks.]

399
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:24,867
[It was the citizens who changed]
[the way the history was being told.]

400
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:29,009
[With their phones, their cameras,]
[they documented independently]

401
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:33,767
[and spread pieces]
[that had quality and importance.]

402
00:27:33,008 --> 00:27:36,010
[The material they had shot]
[was largely broadcasted.]

403
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:40,072
At that moment everything
was empowered in the country,

404
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:43,012
including the importance
of citizen journalism.

405
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:46,700
[The Media Ninja]
[is not a secret organization;]

406
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,667
[it’s a proposition]
[for a network of collaborative]

407
00:27:48,007 --> 00:27:50,008
[and independent journalism.]

408
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:53,567
An event was created on Facebook...

409
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,011
The entire country...

410
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,167
It’s happening in Rio,
in São Paulo...

411
00:27:57,002 --> 00:27:59,010
The TV and the media
are distorting everything.

412
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,008
[The social networks]
[became crucial.]

413
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:09,100
[More important]
[than sharing your opinion,]

414
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:12,138
is becoming the channel through
which opinions are spread.

415
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:19,300
It has always existed, what differs
are the ways to do it.

416
00:28:19,006 --> 00:28:22,539
At the Bastille,
how did the people reunite?

417
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:27,900
Here in Rio, in less than 15 hours
a huge march was organized

418
00:28:28,003 --> 00:28:32,012
for the funeral of Edson Luís,
a student murdered by the police.

419
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:37,967
The huge march was done
without the Internet,

420
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,001
but there was the radio,
the telephone...

421
00:28:40,005 --> 00:28:42,572
mouth to mouth
and things like that.

422
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:49,004
At the end, those
differences correspond

423
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:50,976
to the means available
at each time,

424
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:54,142
but all these means
have always worked

425
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:58,167
and new means
will go on working, I hope.

426
00:29:01,067 --> 00:29:12,800
MONDAY, JUNE 17TH

427
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,367
[Some say the protest on Monday]
[had 100 thousand people,]

428
00:29:25,004 --> 00:29:28,737
but we heard the police talking about
over 1 million people on the streets,

429
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,600
in the entire city of São Paulo.

430
00:29:38,867 --> 00:29:41,700
Oh, fuck, the people are out!

431
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:12,639
[We made it very clear]
[the manifestation really was]

432
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:16,800
about the R$ 0,20.
It was about the fare increase.

433
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:21,367
It makes a huge difference
in the budget of my outskirts!

434
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:23,367
I’m here for him.

435
00:30:23,004 --> 00:30:26,671
So that he can have quality
transportation in his future.

436
00:30:27,001 --> 00:30:29,668
What a coincidence,

437
00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:31,870
there is no violence
when the police isn’t here.

438
00:30:33,003 --> 00:30:34,536
People are right.

439
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:38,835
They are acting like a family,

440
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:41,776
fighting for rights
that belong to them.

441
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,374
I agree with them.

442
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,015
Especially when
there is no violence.

443
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,733
We got a call that the National
Congress was being invaded.

444
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:52,774
I thought “Oh, fuck“.

445
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:59,567
I felt so much adrenaline that day,
as if it was the Bastille.

446
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,076
That’s why I went
to Palácio dos Bandeirantes.

447
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,567
If they were going to force
governor Alckmin out,

448
00:31:06,006 --> 00:31:09,639
I wanted to be there to see it.

449
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:24,667
São Paulo represents
the main economy in the country,

450
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,011
that’s why it drives
a lot more attention.

451
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:32,138
MPL always knew that if one day
we organized an uprising in São Paulo,

452
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:36,673
like it was done in other cities,
it would spread around the country.

453
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,800
[We are part...]

454
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,067
[...of a national fight,]

455
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:45,774
[...of a world fight.]

456
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,567
[We can’t stop now.]

457
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:52,137
[We will only stop]

458
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:55,633
[when we get]

459
00:31:56,009 --> 00:31:57,009
[1 million]

460
00:31:58,467 --> 00:31:59,700
[2 million]

461
00:32:00,004 --> 00:32:01,337
[3 million]

462
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:03,568
[20 million]

463
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:05,136
[people here]

464
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:07,007
[to tell the politicians]

465
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:09,670
[that it isn’t right]

466
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:12,400
[what they do]

467
00:32:13,004 --> 00:32:14,637
[with our money,]

468
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:17,267
[with our health,]

469
00:32:18,006 --> 00:32:19,439
[with our education.]

470
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:22,000
[Tomorrow it will be bigger!]

471
00:32:22,033 --> 00:32:25,367
[Tomorrow it will be bigger!]

472
00:32:36,001 --> 00:32:40,068
They just invaded
the National Congress!

473
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:46,968
Aha-Uhu, the Congress is ours!

474
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,133
Monday I got very sad.

475
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:54,500
I was surprised with the amount
of people on the streets.

476
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:58,900
At start, I thought
it was very positive,

477
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:02,500
but I was worried when I left.

478
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:07,300
At that day I saw lots people
carrying the national flag,

479
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:12,233
organized groups
giving away national flags,

480
00:33:12,967 --> 00:33:20,133
anarchists, the Black Block,
some political parties...

481
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:23,867
There were a lot of groups
that hated each other that day,

482
00:33:23,009 --> 00:33:24,676
and they were all there together.

483
00:33:25,006 --> 00:33:30,010
I saw a total scattering
of the main agenda.

484
00:33:31,033 --> 00:33:36,036
I could barely hear people
shouting about the transportation.

485
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:39,100
While I was at the manifestation,
I thought it was beautiful.

486
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:43,138
But when I got home I saw many
people posting worried comments on-line

487
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:49,000
about the political right
trying to co-opt members,

488
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:51,033
saying they didn’t like
what they’d seen,

489
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:52,700
that the movement had lost focus.

490
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:55,739
But I got home
with my soul cleansed.

491
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,133
[The police declared]
[it was a preventive measure.]

492
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:02,176
TUESDAY, JUNE 18TH

493
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:07,634
[The police intelligence identified]
[a new attempt to invade the building,]

494
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:12,033
[after the acts that happened today]
[in other Brazilian cities.]

495
00:34:13,004 --> 00:34:15,537
[Thank you, Brasília.]
[It is now 6:12PM.]

496
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:16,972
Now..

497
00:34:17,006 --> 00:34:18,007
we will

498
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:21,600
meet

499
00:34:21,633 --> 00:34:23,636
with the other fellows.

500
00:34:24,033 --> 00:34:25,039
For that,

501
00:34:25,667 --> 00:34:27,500
we will

502
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:28,539
turn

503
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:32,300
the next left.

504
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:34,539
Everybody together

505
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:37,170
and organized.

506
00:34:37,005 --> 00:34:40,738
Today the city will stop.

507
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:54,700
Tuesday was a true popular
uprising in the city.

508
00:35:07,002 --> 00:35:09,435
[The movement couldn’t...]

509
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:14,300
[ensure a route]
[for the march.]

510
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:15,340
We didn’t mean to go
to the City Hall.

511
00:35:49,933 --> 00:35:51,167
When it's over...

512
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:57,070
Don’t go outside!
Tell everyone not to go outside!

513
00:35:57,004 --> 00:36:01,011
You must gather everyone
in the great hall.

514
00:36:03,008 --> 00:36:04,012
They are going
to turn over the car.

515
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:06,700
Pay attention!

516
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:14,900
We resisted as much as we could
from calling the shock troop.

517
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:17,575
But the situation
in the building is unsafe now.

518
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:22,841
So, unfortunately, the shock
troop is getting in position...

519
00:36:25,009 --> 00:36:26,176
Excuse me.

520
00:36:35,233 --> 00:36:38,400
[I was in the building]
[when City Hall was attacked.]

521
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:43,570
I could clearly see
the police had stepped back.

522
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:47,975
At a certain moment,
only the municipal guard was there.

523
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:54,068
The government really meant
to hold back the protesters

524
00:36:54,002 --> 00:36:56,669
who were trying to invade the building
using only the municipal guard.

525
00:36:56,009 --> 00:37:00,010
But then the situation in that area
got out of control.

526
00:37:01,033 --> 00:37:03,367
City Hall warned the police.

527
00:37:03,004 --> 00:37:04,737
I too got a text message
from a Secretary warning me

528
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:06,169
the shock troop was coming.

529
00:37:06,004 --> 00:37:08,537
The protesters were heading
to the Municipal Theater to invade it,

530
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:12,033
and the shock troop
took 2 hours to get there.

531
00:37:24,002 --> 00:37:26,005
-Have you ever done this before?
-Never. It’s the first time.

532
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:31,600
-What does it feel like?
-This is our money, from our taxes.

533
00:37:31,633 --> 00:37:34,767
-What are you doing? Stealing?
-No, I’m just breaking stuff.

534
00:37:34,008 --> 00:37:37,275
I don’t take anything.
I have an old TV at home.

535
00:37:38,001 --> 00:37:42,007
-And who deserves what you’re doing?
-The governments deserve it.

536
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:47,167
[There’s this ideologically]
[violent group.]

537
00:37:47,002 --> 00:37:49,035
[They think]
[that’s what must be done;]

538
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,767
they must strike

539
00:37:54,067 --> 00:37:58,067
[institutions]
[that represent capitalism.]

540
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:02,833
[This group got mixed]
[with people on the streets,]

541
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:06,000
[people who live on the streets,]

542
00:38:06,006 --> 00:38:10,939
[delinquents around the city.]

543
00:38:12,033 --> 00:38:19,038
They took advantage
of this situation.

544
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:23,333
The police was totally absent.

545
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:28,600
If people thought
the police was violent,

546
00:38:29,003 --> 00:38:31,370
[they saw what it was like]
[without the police.]

547
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:56,738
WEDNESDAY, JUNE 19TH

548
00:38:58,567 --> 00:39:03,533
We’ve been talking with Mayor
Fernando Haddad during these last days.

549
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:11,100
[We will go back to the R$ 3,00 fare,]
[so that the city can move on.]

550
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:14,771
I got the City Counsel
together this week.

551
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:19,735
We must reopen the discussion
about the consequences

552
00:39:20,002 --> 00:39:23,003
implied in the decision taken,
for today and for the future.

553
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:38,336
6 years ago everybody
thought it was crazy,

554
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,933
and now people are discussing
it on the streets, at the bars.

555
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:42,972
If I were a transport businessman,

556
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,538
I’d frankly think twice before
crushing the people to get more profit,

557
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:49,300
because the people
are very aware of things now.

558
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:52,700
We’ll have to cut back
some investments,

559
00:39:53,008 --> 00:39:57,875
because the companies
can’t afford the fare reduction.

560
00:39:58,007 --> 00:40:03,674
The State will bear these costs
by adjusting the investments,

561
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:05,741
holding back in some other areas.

562
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:10,573
We’ll drink beer to celebrate...

563
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:18,140
THURSDAY, JUNE 20TH

564
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:39,000
People go out to the streets
for very different reasons.

565
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:42,467
This scattering allows
certain movements,

566
00:40:42,005 --> 00:40:44,972
which are a bit more organized,

567
00:40:45,005 --> 00:40:47,838
to take on the streets
with different convictions

568
00:40:48,367 --> 00:40:50,371
and clash against one another.

569
00:40:50,008 --> 00:40:52,015
No fascism!

570
00:40:53,533 --> 00:40:55,100
No fascism!

571
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:57,142
No political parties!
No political parties!

572
00:40:58,067 --> 00:41:04,333
In June 2013, nobody on the streets
put their differences aside,

573
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:06,139
for the benefit of common purpose.

574
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:10,100
On the contrary, people got out
on the streets

575
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:12,100
bringing all their differences.

576
00:41:12,133 --> 00:41:14,142
Talk to yourselves,
you bunch of losers!

577
00:41:15,067 --> 00:41:20,067
If the people on the streets
are side by side,

578
00:41:20,001 --> 00:41:22,268
but they have
different political opinions,

579
00:41:22,004 --> 00:41:27,009
which sometimes are incompatible,
surely the differences will appear,

580
00:41:27,933 --> 00:41:30,567
and there will be violent episodes.

581
00:41:30,006 --> 00:41:32,007
You’re a bunch of bourgeois!

582
00:41:32,733 --> 00:41:33,737
You don’t make any sense!

583
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,333
-I don’t represent a political party!
-So what?

584
00:41:36,367 --> 00:41:37,833
No violence!

585
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,237
Hey, let the girl talk!

586
00:41:47,003 --> 00:41:49,470
Thief! Thief!

587
00:41:49,008 --> 00:41:52,475
Fascists! Fascists!
You won’t go through!

588
00:41:53,003 --> 00:41:55,008
Morons! Morons!

589
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:57,835
Opportunists!

590
00:42:02,002 --> 00:42:05,135
A political party
won’t solve this problem.

591
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:08,533
Don’t oppress!
You’re being oppressive.

592
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,571
There was no oppression
to freedom of speech.

593
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,033
There wasn’t?

594
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,100
How can you oppress someone
because they held up a flag?

595
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:22,400
The movement has no owners,
my friend.

596
00:42:22,433 --> 00:42:26,800
By your speech, you want
the military dictatorship back!

597
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:29,600
What about this riot?
People are almost killing themselves.

598
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:31,800
They don’t seem
to understand one another.

599
00:42:34,533 --> 00:42:39,600
Each day there are
more isolated groups.

600
00:42:39,633 --> 00:42:42,700
Before it was everybody together.

601
00:42:43,233 --> 00:42:45,700
We didn’t agree with many
of the causes that started to appear.

602
00:42:45,733 --> 00:42:48,734
Many conservative ideas
started taking over the marches.

603
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:52,268
But we always understood the protests
should be centered

604
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:54,237
on the decrease of the fares.

605
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:57,100
It’s only natural that
a huge popular mobilization,

606
00:42:57,133 --> 00:42:59,139
especially one that turned out
to be victorious

607
00:42:59,767 --> 00:43:00,772
and revoked the fare increase,

608
00:43:01,003 --> 00:43:02,936
will motivate
other manifestations to flourish,

609
00:43:03,267 --> 00:43:05,700
and many other topics
will be taken to the streets.

610
00:43:06,467 --> 00:43:09,100
Groups of kids
who are not usually political

611
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:11,838
[participated on the demonstrations.]

612
00:43:12,367 --> 00:43:14,333
Then they became orphans,
in a certain way,

613
00:43:14,367 --> 00:43:16,833
but they kept on going.

614
00:43:16,867 --> 00:43:20,933
But there were also groups
with very bad intentions.

615
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:24,300
This Thursday at the Paulista avenue
there were skinheads,

616
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:28,900
“the white supremacy”, neo-Nazis,
people from the extreme right

617
00:43:28,933 --> 00:43:31,936
who were trying
to co-opt these young kids.

618
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:46,500
When it became evident that there was
a huge level of discontentment,

619
00:43:46,533 --> 00:43:49,600
and you had the right
to show your discontent,

620
00:43:49,633 --> 00:43:51,600
people stopped repressing
their opinions.

621
00:43:52,008 --> 00:43:54,841
All the demands appeared
on the streets,

622
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:59,275
in a spectrum going from the extreme
political left to the extreme right.

623
00:44:00,533 --> 00:44:03,167
I’d say that’s very natural,

624
00:44:03,867 --> 00:44:07,933
it means that politics
has regained the streets.

625
00:44:07,967 --> 00:44:08,971
Let me ask you:

626
00:44:09,004 --> 00:44:12,006
who is here in the protest
because of the bus fare?

627
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:13,633
Raise your hands.

628
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:16,167
Who is here for the rest?

629
00:44:16,002 --> 00:44:20,269
Renan, Sarney,
get out of this country!

630
00:44:22,667 --> 00:44:24,533
Feliciano,
my asshole has no religion.

631
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:29,568
It’s missing focus.
They all want different things.

632
00:44:29,007 --> 00:44:31,240
It’s education for one,
corruption to another...

633
00:44:31,967 --> 00:44:33,967
Another one is about the PEC 37.

634
00:44:34,967 --> 00:44:38,233
It doesn’t work out if everybody
wants to approach all topics

635
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:40,167
at the same time.
I think this is going nowhere.

636
00:44:40,267 --> 00:44:41,273
Flags! Flags!

637
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,367
How much is it?

638
00:44:44,004 --> 00:44:45,371
-R$ 20
-R$ 20?!

639
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:47,367
What are you protesting for?

640
00:44:47,004 --> 00:44:52,004
I’m against this law...

641
00:44:52,533 --> 00:44:54,536
this constitutional amendment
they are planning to do.

642
00:44:54,867 --> 00:44:57,868
-Which one?
-PC... PC 37

643
00:44:58,004 --> 00:45:00,011
What is the PEC 37?

644
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:03,067
-PC 37!
-What is it?

645
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:06,009
PEC 37 is a project
for a constitutional amendment

646
00:45:07,003 --> 00:45:10,270
that limits
the investigation activities

647
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:13,668
to the members of the civil
and federal police,

648
00:45:14,167 --> 00:45:16,033
no longer allowing the Public
Prosecutor’s Department to proceed

649
00:45:16,067 --> 00:45:18,000
with police investigations not only

650
00:45:18,033 --> 00:45:20,500
as the one entitled
for the criminal prosecution,

651
00:45:20,533 --> 00:45:23,800
but also as the one which holds
the right for the investigations.

652
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:25,333
PEC 37 is...

653
00:45:25,008 --> 00:45:26,075
Oh, my gosh...

654
00:45:26,009 --> 00:45:28,015
It’s a...
How can I say?

655
00:45:30,005 --> 00:45:31,038
Then what happens?

656
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:33,500
They go out
to the streets to protest.

657
00:45:33,533 --> 00:45:35,534
And these protests
seem a little shallow.

658
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:38,500
They protest for education,
health, against corruption.

659
00:45:38,533 --> 00:45:42,067
These are protests of people
with no political instruction.

660
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:45,001
PEC 37 wants to blind us
for these robberies,

661
00:45:45,133 --> 00:45:48,800
these crimes that the government makes,
well, not the government,

662
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:53,367
the people
at the House of Representatives...

663
00:45:53,004 --> 00:45:55,008
They want to blind us
for all of that.

664
00:45:55,009 --> 00:45:59,276
But that’s the short version.
It’s very complex.

665
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:03,542
And I’m also here
for the health system.

666
00:46:04,533 --> 00:46:06,540
I’m doing this
because I’m Brazilian,

667
00:46:07,267 --> 00:46:09,272
even though I’m going
to London in September.

668
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,700
I’m a Brazilian citizen

669
00:46:11,733 --> 00:46:14,900
and I’m outraged
with the fucking corruption!

670
00:46:14,933 --> 00:46:16,167
Fascist!

671
00:46:16,002 --> 00:46:18,004
Then respect
your country’s constitution!

672
00:46:18,433 --> 00:46:21,267
No political parties!

673
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:23,673
We’re going down
a dangerous path, guys.

674
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:25,374
-No, we aren’t.
-It’s a dangerous path.

675
00:46:26,001 --> 00:46:29,001
The dangerous path
is to be manipulated.

676
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:32,167
We no political parties
we’ll go back to dictatorship.

677
00:46:33,005 --> 00:46:36,014
That’s what
we’re fighting for!

678
00:46:37,633 --> 00:46:40,167
They may not like the politicians,
I don’t like them either.

679
00:46:40,002 --> 00:46:43,007
They may not like president Dilma,
governor Alckmin, mayor Haddad,

680
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:45,441
but there hasn’t been invented

681
00:46:46,267 --> 00:46:49,400
another way to mediate
the State and the society,

682
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:51,767
if not by politics
and political parties.

683
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:55,012
Attention: the national broadcast
of radio and television is now open

684
00:46:56,233 --> 00:46:59,467
for the declaration
of president Dilma Rousseff.

685
00:47:00,007 --> 00:47:01,540
WEDNESDAY, JUNE 26TH

686
00:47:02,267 --> 00:47:04,133
Come rain! We’ll get wet!

687
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:06,900
And wet we will fight!

688
00:47:06,933 --> 00:47:08,600
My friends,

689
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:14,600
All we Brazilians
are following closely

690
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:17,833
the manifestations
occurring in the country.

691
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:21,972
It isn’t lack of resources;
it’s not lack of money.

692
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,638
There is lots of money.

693
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:28,170
The World Cup is producing
millions and millions.

694
00:47:28,005 --> 00:47:30,172
And the worker
is the one who suffers.

695
00:47:31,003 --> 00:47:34,470
We want these criminals
in the police in jail!

696
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:40,542
I trust this moment we’re living.

697
00:47:43,009 --> 00:47:48,776
It’s a slap in our face,
as strong as we deserve it.

698
00:47:52,767 --> 00:47:58,000
For those who can’t stand
the traffic in São Paulo anymore,

699
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,342
join our fight!

700
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:03,335
In reality, everybody
has causes for dissatisfaction.

701
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:07,133
But those who really feel it
in their skins

702
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:13,170
the matters related
to transportation, safety,

703
00:48:13,005 --> 00:48:15,472
are the lower classes
living in the outskirts.

704
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,467
I like it when the people
from the outskirts say,

705
00:48:21,005 --> 00:48:22,013
“the outskirts
were never sleeping”.

706
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:28,800
Because the idea that says “Brazil
was sleeping and now it’s awake”

707
00:48:28,833 --> 00:48:35,840
makes you think everyone was well,
laying in their golden beds...

708
00:48:36,567 --> 00:48:39,567
The outskirts were never
sleeping in golden beds.

709
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:42,004
Of course I didn’t like this
talk of “Brazil has awoken”,

710
00:48:42,433 --> 00:48:44,500
because I’m part of a Brazil
that was never sleeping.

711
00:48:44,533 --> 00:48:45,567
And there is something else,

712
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:46,573
the bullets are not rubber
bullets in the outskirts.

713
00:48:47,002 --> 00:48:48,004
I think many mothers,

714
00:48:48,433 --> 00:48:49,441
when they heard about
rubber bullets in protests downtown,

715
00:48:50,267 --> 00:48:51,633
must have thought, “we’d rather have
rubber bullets here too,

716
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:53,700
my son would still be alive”.

717
00:48:55,267 --> 00:48:56,933
The people from the outskirts
always go to the streets.

718
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:57,969
Even before the protests,

719
00:48:58,007 --> 00:49:01,174
they did monthly manifestations
on behalf of the transportation,

720
00:49:02,733 --> 00:49:03,767
habitation.

721
00:49:03,867 --> 00:49:08,868
The truth is they don’t stand out
as much as a protest in Paulista avenue.

722
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:11,833
If the outskirts manifestations
were at Paulista avenue,

723
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:13,833
I’m sure the bullets
wouldn’t be made of rubber.

724
00:49:14,267 --> 00:49:15,272
It’s complicated
at the outskirts.

725
00:49:15,008 --> 00:49:18,775
You can go to hospital’s doors
and see what it’s like...

726
00:49:19,006 --> 00:49:22,339
[A 11th grade kid]
[can’t write or read.]

727
00:49:23,006 --> 00:49:24,973
Some may say I exaggerate...

728
00:49:25,006 --> 00:49:27,012
We are a country that lost
55.000 people murdered last year.

729
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,267
It’s a lot of people,
over 50.000 people murdered.

730
00:49:33,009 --> 00:49:37,009
[The placid shores of Ipiranga heard]

731
00:49:38,002 --> 00:49:41,035
[The blaring shout of a heroic folk]

732
00:49:43,006 --> 00:49:45,007
Fight! Fight!
People have the power!

733
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:48,934
Fight! Fight!
People have the power!

734
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:54,576
Our political system has shut out
the society and is closed around itself,

735
00:49:55,005 --> 00:49:57,007
there is no longer
a polarization of positions,

736
00:49:57,733 --> 00:50:01,300
when you can tell clearly the ideology
in the power from the opposition.

737
00:50:01,009 --> 00:50:04,376
So, what we have is a mismatch
between a political system

738
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:08,570
that works based
is this governability agreement,

739
00:50:09,008 --> 00:50:12,016
and the people on the streets with
a huge variety of political opinions,

740
00:50:13,633 --> 00:50:15,635
that are not reflected
in the political system.

741
00:50:16,233 --> 00:50:18,238
We are living a very
strong political emptiness.

742
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:21,171
For the first time,
after the dictatorship ended,

743
00:50:21,006 --> 00:50:23,008
we have the depletion
of a political cycle,

744
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:26,833
without forming
another alternative cycle.

745
00:50:27,133 --> 00:50:35,140
It was very clear to the authorities
that none of them could represent

746
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:38,300
what was happening
on the streets.

747
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:50,167
Nor PT or PSDB could present
themselves as representatives

748
00:50:50,002 --> 00:50:51,006
for the protesters.

749
00:50:55,002 --> 00:50:56,069
[We’re in an island.]

750
00:50:56,733 --> 00:50:58,738
[It’s a blue island,]
[an illuminated island,]

751
00:50:59,006 --> 00:51:00,010
a fantasy island.

752
00:51:01,033 --> 00:51:03,267
It’s like there is nothing
happening outside.

753
00:51:05,004 --> 00:51:07,006
WEDNESDAY, JUNE 26TH

754
00:51:08,004 --> 00:51:10,237
These kids got ahead of us.

755
00:51:11,002 --> 00:51:12,435
[The kids are out on the streets]

756
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:14,669
to show how fragile
are the institutions.

757
00:51:14,009 --> 00:51:17,010
[They are the true democrats]
[and they are worried about]

758
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:21,041
[the fragility of the official]
[institutions caused by our mistakes,]

759
00:51:21,867 --> 00:51:22,871
[the mistakes]
[of the Federal Supreme Court,]

760
00:51:23,003 --> 00:51:24,936
[mistakes of the executive branch.]

761
00:51:25,433 --> 00:51:28,967
[Because we are unable]
[to deal together with rules]

762
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,867
that show the independence
of each branch of power.

763
00:51:32,009 --> 00:51:33,742
We are under a threat.

764
00:51:34,667 --> 00:51:39,333
[The prove is that people,]
[tired of waiting for our actions,]

765
00:51:39,367 --> 00:51:40,533
[took the streets.]

766
00:51:50,867 --> 00:51:53,874
I don’t recall any episode
in Brazilian history

767
00:51:54,967 --> 00:51:58,533
[in which you had]
[a huge mass of people]

768
00:51:58,567 --> 00:52:02,700
[marching towards the national]
[congress to break it.]

769
00:52:03,033 --> 00:52:04,867
[And the police couldn’t do]
[anything to prevent it,]

770
00:52:04,009 --> 00:52:06,442
[only deviate the protesters]
[to another side]

771
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:09,200
[so they would set something]
[else on fire.]

772
00:52:09,233 --> 00:52:10,967
[So they set]
[the Itamaraty building on fire.]

773
00:52:11,367 --> 00:52:14,100
[Now we can see fire.]

774
00:52:20,867 --> 00:52:23,533
What we are living
today is a reaction.

775
00:52:23,567 --> 00:52:24,568
All actions have a reaction.

776
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:26,015
They had it coming,
people are reacting.

777
00:52:27,533 --> 00:52:30,538
The politicians
are generally like that,

778
00:52:31,008 --> 00:52:32,741
they can smell the demands
on the streets

779
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,576
and they follow it to try
and understand

780
00:52:35,005 --> 00:52:37,008
what the people are asking for,

781
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:39,800
even if they don’t agree
with any of that.

782
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:42,840
The people answered they
were happy about the country.

783
00:52:43,567 --> 00:52:52,200
Why, then, all this
dissatisfaction exploding now?

784
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:54,573
[Another day of efficiency]
[in the congress,]

785
00:52:55,002 --> 00:52:56,569
[like we had never seen before.]

786
00:52:56,008 --> 00:52:59,014
[The protesters who fought for]
[the rejection of PEC 37]

787
00:53:00,433 --> 00:53:02,867
[are now singing]
[the national anthem.]

788
00:53:02,009 --> 00:53:03,014
[The senators approved the project]

789
00:53:04,433 --> 00:53:06,440
[that makes the crime]
[of corruption hideous.]

790
00:53:07,005 --> 00:53:08,005
[I have a question.]

791
00:53:08,533 --> 00:53:13,533
[The protests will start in 30,]
[40 minutes, out there.]

792
00:53:13,567 --> 00:53:17,574
[Are we going]
[to close this session?]

793
00:53:18,003 --> 00:53:20,336
[As the House president,]
[I can answer you]

794
00:53:21,033 --> 00:53:24,767
[that we’ll be here]
[all night if needed,]

795
00:53:24,008 --> 00:53:25,675
[as long as the manifestation]
[is out there.]

796
00:53:26,567 --> 00:53:28,570
[Step carefully.]
[Step carefully.]

797
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:31,142
[If you can’t deal with the ants,]
[don’t poke the anthill.]

798
00:53:32,067 --> 00:53:35,833
[My government has been fighting,]
[alongside the national congress,]

799
00:53:36,133 --> 00:53:41,567
[for the oil royalties]
[to be used 100% in education.]

800
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:44,900
She says the royalties
will go to education.

801
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:45,937
Who will control this?

802
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,367
Who guarantees
it will go to education?

803
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:51,900
The protesters react like that

804
00:53:51,933 --> 00:53:55,600
because they think the people
in the power are cynical,

805
00:53:55,633 --> 00:53:58,200
because the movement
was actually against them.

806
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:06,567
The congress recognizes
the legitimacy

807
00:54:06,006 --> 00:54:11,639
of democratic manifestations,
like the ones that happened today.

808
00:54:12,267 --> 00:54:15,633
I personally gave orders
to the legislative police

809
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,367
not to repress
the popular manifestation.

810
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,767
The police are protecting
me while I’m here.

811
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:29,341
That’s very embarrassing.

812
00:54:30,004 --> 00:54:34,008
Even in the worst moments
of revolutions around the world,

813
00:54:35,233 --> 00:54:38,267
people protested against
the executive branch,

814
00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:41,400
never against the legislative
or judiciary.

815
00:54:42,267 --> 00:54:43,700
Where did we go wrong?

816
00:54:45,009 --> 00:54:47,742
Hey, police!
Go fuck yourself!

817
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,867
Hey, police!
Go fuck yourself!

818
00:54:56,533 --> 00:54:58,400
If they don’t understand
that what is at stake here

819
00:54:58,433 --> 00:55:01,436
is politics as a profession,
as a business,

820
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:04,700
then there is a real risk.

821
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:09,738
We will live in bitterness
not only because of our impotence,

822
00:55:10,267 --> 00:55:13,500
celebrating with our vote
and mockery our distance

823
00:55:13,533 --> 00:55:15,867
from the political system.

824
00:55:15,009 --> 00:55:19,010
We will begin living a series of
tensions that won’t have an outlet,

825
00:55:20,033 --> 00:55:21,100
a channel out.

826
00:55:21,133 --> 00:55:22,167
That’s very bad,

827
00:55:22,002 --> 00:55:25,435
it could produce destructive
results to everyone.

828
00:55:38,003 --> 00:55:41,003
THURSDAY, JUNE 27TH

829
00:55:52,533 --> 00:55:54,267
Guys, the idea is this:

830
00:55:54,006 --> 00:55:58,073
we go together,
and come back together,

831
00:55:58,007 --> 00:56:01,840
peacefully, from the Mineirão
soccer stadium, ok?

832
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:06,500
All those in favor
of going to Mineirão,

833
00:56:06,867 --> 00:56:08,933
raise one of your hands.

834
00:56:47,967 --> 00:56:51,968
Is this a joke or what?

835
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:56,533
They can afford the World Cup,
but not education.

836
00:57:07,067 --> 00:57:12,233
In what measure the Confederations
Cup motivated the manifestations?

837
00:57:12,333 --> 00:57:15,867
It was an influence not only
because the world press was here

838
00:57:15,009 --> 00:57:19,242
and it was a good chance
to show the movement to the world,

839
00:57:20,006 --> 00:57:26,006
but also because the sumptuousness
of the new stadiums

840
00:57:27,033 --> 00:57:28,039
horrified the Brazilian people.

841
00:57:28,009 --> 00:57:30,476
How can they build a stadium
in the FIFA standards,

842
00:57:31,633 --> 00:57:33,267
as is the Brasilia stadium?

843
00:57:33,005 --> 00:57:34,572
It is absurd.

844
00:57:35,633 --> 00:57:39,800
Like you said, it’s like
Taj Mahal in Brasilia,

845
00:57:40,267 --> 00:57:42,700
a city that doesn’t even
have soccer.

846
00:57:43,867 --> 00:57:46,633
And they can’t build a hospital
in these same standards?

847
00:57:46,667 --> 00:57:48,675
People have to accept that the best
hospital in Brasilia is the airport...

848
00:58:29,633 --> 00:58:34,500
We must stop with this nonsense
of thinking soccer

849
00:58:34,533 --> 00:58:36,067
and politics don’t mix.

850
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:40,473
That’s the most reactionary speech
you could possibly make.

851
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:43,600
That’s the speech João Havelange
made all his life,

852
00:58:43,633 --> 00:58:44,641
the one he used
to support dictators.

853
00:58:45,467 --> 00:58:48,472
Could be either Videla
or Médici, or Geisel.

854
00:58:50,133 --> 00:58:51,900
“I don’t mix soccer with politics”.

855
00:58:53,002 --> 00:58:55,010
Does your lack of political
consciousness allow you

856
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,567
to act like a barbarian then?

857
00:58:57,009 --> 00:58:59,009
No. Things always get mixed.

858
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,004
You eat your
breakfast politically;

859
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,008
so you can only imagine
a soccer team,

860
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:08,700
which is capable
of mobilizing the country.

861
00:59:09,001 --> 00:59:11,934
[Regarding the World Cup,]
[I want to make clear]

862
00:59:12,067 --> 00:59:17,933
[that the money spent on]
[the arenas came from financings,]

863
00:59:17,967 --> 00:59:21,971
[which will be properly paid]
[by the companies and governments]

864
00:59:22,004 --> 00:59:24,010
[who are profiting]
[with these stadiums.]

865
00:59:25,267 --> 00:59:27,800
The name of the true president
of Brazil, today, is FIFA.

866
00:59:28,167 --> 00:59:32,633
FIFA got to our country and set
a State inside our State.

867
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:33,700
And that’s it.

868
00:59:40,004 --> 00:59:41,437
It’s not possible!

869
00:59:42,002 --> 00:59:44,003
Is it right to make
fools out of the people?

870
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:48,700
In 2014, we’ll all be out there
saying “vote for me!

871
00:59:48,733 --> 00:59:51,867
I’ll be your representative
at the House of Representatives”.

872
00:59:51,009 --> 00:59:52,576
[How are we representatives?]

873
00:59:55,009 --> 00:59:58,018
What does hideous means?
Hideous means disgusting,

874
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:02,900
[something that makes you]
[want to throw up.]

875
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:06,500
Corruption kills people
at the doorsteps of hospitals.

876
01:00:06,933 --> 01:00:08,940
Corruption kills people
in the highways.

877
01:00:09,667 --> 01:00:13,673
Corruption steals the future
of an entire generation of Brazilians.

878
01:00:14,003 --> 01:00:16,005
The politicians have never
denied they are criminals;

879
01:00:16,008 --> 01:00:18,375
we are the ones
who are cowards.

880
01:00:19,467 --> 01:00:23,433
We should be whipped by
them every day at 6:00 PM.

881
01:00:24,133 --> 01:00:25,136
All of us, all the workers,

882
01:00:25,467 --> 01:00:27,033
all the honest people
in this country,

883
01:00:27,067 --> 01:00:29,067
should bend over before
them and get hit.

884
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:30,768
Because of all
we let them do...

885
01:00:30,009 --> 01:00:34,010
Somehow I consented these
men to remain in power,

886
01:00:35,033 --> 01:00:37,500
to leave the people
in misery.

887
01:00:37,006 --> 01:00:40,006
I consented through my silence,
for being coward.

888
01:00:42,433 --> 01:00:44,439
I think these men are right,
they ought to rob us,

889
01:00:45,067 --> 01:00:49,072
because we are too coward.
We’re a very hypocrite society.

890
01:00:49,867 --> 01:00:51,533
We give R$ 1,00 to a bum

891
01:00:51,567 --> 01:00:53,433
but we don’t want to know
who turned that guy into a bum.

892
01:00:55,008 --> 01:00:56,015
It’s the fucking revolution!

893
01:01:05,467 --> 01:01:06,472
Revolution!

894
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,033
I see in this moment one of
the most important moments

895
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:11,300
in our history.

896
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:14,336
Today, thousands of people
occupy the streets.

897
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,433
There’s a clear
lack of leadership.

898
01:01:17,467 --> 01:01:21,133
It’s a sign of renouncement to
the old way of making politics.

899
01:01:30,003 --> 01:01:32,070
[Soccer, as sport in general,]

900
01:01:32,004 --> 01:01:36,771
[is a symbol of peace among]
[the different cultures.]

901
01:01:37,633 --> 01:01:41,635
[Brazil deserves to make]
[a great World Cup, and it will.]

902
01:01:41,933 --> 01:01:45,900
When the supporters continued singing
a cappella the national anthem,

903
01:01:46,633 --> 01:01:50,767
and the players singed together
while standing in the field,

904
01:01:50,008 --> 01:01:53,241
something special happened.

905
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:58,533
I even wrote a column about it,
titled “The anthem’s fuel”.

906
01:02:07,067 --> 01:02:08,100
SUNDAY, JUNE 30TH

907
01:02:08,133 --> 01:02:11,167
[The placid shores of Ipiranga heard]

908
01:02:11,002 --> 01:02:14,435
[The blaring shout of a heroic folk]

909
01:02:14,667 --> 01:02:18,500
[The sun of Liberty in shining rays]

910
01:02:18,533 --> 01:02:21,900
[Shone in homeland's sky at this instant]

911
01:02:21,933 --> 01:02:25,800
[If the pledge of this equality]

912
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:29,567
[We could conquer with strong arm]

913
01:02:29,006 --> 01:02:32,873
[In thy bosom,]
[O freedom]

914
01:02:33,005 --> 01:02:36,372
[Our chest defy death itself!]

915
01:02:36,009 --> 01:02:37,942
[O beloved,]
[Idolized homeland]

916
01:02:38,867 --> 01:02:41,233
[Hail, hail]

917
01:02:41,267 --> 01:02:43,275
[Brazil, an intense dream, a vivid ray]

918
01:02:44,001 --> 01:02:47,534
[Of love and hope descends to earth]

919
01:02:47,667 --> 01:02:51,333
[If in thy comely,]
[Smiling and limpid sky]

920
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:54,933
[The image of the Southern Cross blazes]

921
01:02:54,967 --> 01:02:59,033
[Giant by thine own nature]

922
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:02,074
[Thou art beautiful, thou art strong,]
[An impavid colossus]

923
01:03:02,008 --> 01:03:05,375
[And thy future mirrors thy greatness]

924
01:03:06,002 --> 01:03:07,835
[Adored Land]

925
01:03:08,067 --> 01:03:09,800
[Amongst a thousand others]
[Art thou, Brazil]

926
01:03:09,833 --> 01:03:11,700
[O beloved homeland]

927
01:03:11,733 --> 01:03:12,900
[Of the sons of this ground]

928
01:03:12,933 --> 01:03:15,867
[Thou art kind mother,]
[Beloved homeland]

929
01:03:15,009 --> 01:03:16,376
[Brazil!]

930
01:03:28,007 --> 01:03:29,940
[In the democratic game,]

931
01:03:31,833 --> 01:03:34,835
[the winner could become the loser]
[in the next 5 minutes,]

932
01:03:35,067 --> 01:03:37,068
[or maybe nobody wins anything.]

933
01:03:37,733 --> 01:03:39,739
Because the conflicts
are bigger than the solutions.

934
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:45,735
But I believe that,
in a very peculiar way,

935
01:03:46,633 --> 01:03:53,200
[it could be a good change if we started]
[complaining about what’s wrong.]

936
01:04:04,033 --> 01:04:06,100
Fuck the World Cup!

937
01:04:17,004 --> 01:04:19,871
[40 million people.]

938
01:04:20,003 --> 01:04:23,636
[We made a lot of progress]
[in the last 20 years,]

939
01:04:23,967 --> 01:04:26,533
[thanks to the past governments,]
[the Brazilian society,]

940
01:04:26,567 --> 01:04:27,575
[the democratic constitution.]

941
01:04:28,004 --> 01:04:30,008
[This didn’t just magically happen.]

942
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:33,967
[We’ve been taking]
[more and more Brazilians]

943
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:37,400
[from extreme poverty conditions.]

944
01:04:37,433 --> 01:04:39,700
[Now, this people want more.]

945
01:04:44,633 --> 01:04:48,636
[There is the dream of a society]
[that goes beyond the consumer market.]

946
01:04:49,033 --> 01:04:52,037
[Today, we can say we have]
[less social disparities,]

947
01:04:53,002 --> 01:04:55,769
[and that reflects]
[on people´s right to consume.]

948
01:04:56,567 --> 01:05:00,933
However, the public schools
still reproduce social disparities.

949
01:05:01,933 --> 01:05:03,936
[The health system still]
[reproduces social disparities…]

950
01:05:09,009 --> 01:05:11,342
Get out of there!
Get the fuck out of there!

951
01:05:36,667 --> 01:05:39,333
[We will resist!]
[We will resist!]

952
01:06:16,367 --> 01:06:18,372
You're discrediting
the popular wisdom

953
01:06:18,009 --> 01:06:25,376
if you think the people mix victory
in sports with political needs.

954
01:06:26,667 --> 01:06:29,600
Even in the specific moment of victory,
they don't mix the two things together.

955
01:06:29,633 --> 01:06:30,642
It doesn’t mean the governments

956
01:06:31,567 --> 01:06:34,400
don’t try to take advantage
of the situation, though.

957
01:07:10,367 --> 01:07:17,367
Whether you're a conservative,
ultra-liberal, extreme-left,

958
01:07:17,004 --> 01:07:23,071
anarchist, environmentalist,
ruralist… Nobody is satisfied.

959
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:27,838
Everyone feels the structure in power
needs to go through profound changes.

960
01:07:28,367 --> 01:07:30,700
There were almost 1 million
people in Rio de Janeiro...

961
01:07:30,733 --> 01:07:32,900
I don’t know how many thousand
in São Paulo, in Brasilia...

962
01:07:33,033 --> 01:07:34,667
[We got so close!]

963
01:07:35,006 --> 01:07:36,015
I think Brazil suffers
from premature ejaculation.

964
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:41,100
We were there, had some fun,
and thought,

965
01:07:41,133 --> 01:07:42,567
“Is this what
revolution is like?

966
01:07:42,006 --> 01:07:43,009
I’ve had enough,
I’m leaving.”

967
01:07:45,467 --> 01:07:47,475
[The referee has whistled!]

968
01:07:48,003 --> 01:07:54,006
[We’re the champions]
[of the Confederations Cup!]

969
01:07:54,633 --> 01:08:00,067
[The month of June]
[brought out the need]

970
01:08:00,005 --> 01:08:02,072
[for everyone to stop]
[and rethink themselves.]

971
01:08:02,007 --> 01:08:06,540
[The political parties, the unions,]
[the mainstream media, the police,]

972
01:08:07,267 --> 01:08:08,300
the political system...

973
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:09,700
everyone must stop
and balance things.

974
01:08:09,008 --> 01:08:14,275
[To believe!]
[It’s time to unite and believe!]

975
01:08:22,133 --> 01:08:25,300
[Tomorrow it will be greater!]
[Tomorrow it will be greater!]
