[laughter in distance]

186
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,943
[laughing] Right!

187
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,311
Hey, watch out, here he comes.

188
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,413
The Omega marking gun.

189
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,851
It shoots a ten millimeter paint pellet.

190
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,221
Accurately up to about, oh...

191
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,958
-One hundred fifty yards. -[firing]

192
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,161
Gotcha! [laughing]

193
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,865
Yeah, it's used extensively in your country for marking animals.

194
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,601
[laughs]

195
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,971
And, uh... Also, it's used for tactical war games.

196
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,341
Yeah, I brought a few of these along,

197
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,543
I thought we might have some fun with them, you know.

198
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,845
Oh!

199
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,147
You didn't find my little joke too disturbing?

200
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,850
No, no problem.

201
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,119
Ah.

202
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,588
Just remind me not to turn my back on you.

203
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,392
[chuckles nervously]

204
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,995
Hey, Eric, why don't you wake Yvonne up, eh?

205
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,630
We'll have some breakfast.

206
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:52,631
I'll get it.

207
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,068
Yeah, you, uh...

208
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,536
[paint gun cocking]

209
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:58,871
You must be hungry, Mr. Rush.

210
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,072
[firing]

211
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,043
Yeah, I'm starving.

212
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,590
Thanks, Yvonne, that was great.

213
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,159
Glad you liked it. We live well in the wild.

214
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,061
Yvonne, can we have some more coffee, please?

215
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,231
[Simon] Come on, I'll give you a hand.

216
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,066
Mr. Rush and I have some business to discuss.

217
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,168
-We do? -Oh, yeah.

218
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:04,903
Well...

219
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,105
Coffee!

220
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,344
Now, uh, Mr. Rush...

221
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,546
Look, if this is about the money

222
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,048
I told you my paper will cover all my expenses, all right?

223
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,549
Everything's about money.

224
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,386
But you're welcome to stay here as a guest.

225
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,590
As I understand it, you, uh... You got no money,

226
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:28,127
you... got no passport, no visa.

227
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,430
And no way of contacting your office, am I right?

228
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,367
Yeah, you're right.

229
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,636
Now, as I said, you're welcome to stay here as a guest

230
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,139
and I'll try... and pull some strings

231
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,108
for you to fly out with us when we leave, is that acceptable?

232
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,678
Oh, yeah, that's perfect, thank you.

233
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,280
No, it's our pleasure.

234
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,484
We've got a proposition we'd like to make you.

235
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,787
You know, we got a... [chuckles]

236
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,323
An idea for a little entertainment, and we'd like your help.

237
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,825
Yeah!

238
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,126
Might even be a story in it.

239
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,597
To make up for your untimely departure from the war zone.

240
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,666
[Jason] Simon...

241
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,968
Look, we're all pretty pissed off with this hunting shit.

242
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,737
Kind of soft targets, you know.

243
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:14,440
Kinda like Eric.

244
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,044
Hey, only kidding. Joke!

245
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:22,748
Yeah, right, after a while, dumb animals are no fun.

246
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,318
Like playing Pac-Man after flying an F-16 simulator.

247
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:30,322
What we're saying is that hunting is no longer a challenge for us.

248
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,024
We're looking for something

249
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,792
with a little bit more... subtlety.

250
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,929
Well I, uh...

251
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:39,064
I don't understand what that has to do with me.

252
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,234
We want to hunt you.

253
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,303
[chuckles] What?

254
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,474
With these.

255
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,214
Ouch!

256
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,416
Fuck, give me a break, man. I'm trying to take a shit here, man.

257
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,651
-[laughing] Gotcha, you asshole. -Asshole?

258
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,587
Man, I'll give you another asshole between your eyes.

259
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:02,788
Hi Yvonne!

260
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:07,059
Hey, Jay, kiss my microchip.

261
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:10,829
Shit.

262
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,701
[squawking]

263
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:21,440
We'll give you food and water and an ample supply of pellets.

264
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,842
And a 15 minute start.

265
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:27,012
Now, the idea here is to get a clean body shot for a kill.

266
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,415
So, we hunt you, and you hunt us.

267
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,550
It's the ultimate, man on man.

268
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,886
Of course you don't have to play.

269
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,155
As Bob pointed out, you may find good material for a story.

270
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,323
And even if you don't, well,

271
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,826
I think, you must admit that being hunted has a certain appeal.

272
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,494
A real challenge, eh?

273
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,962
Yeah, four against one.

274
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,531
A real challenge.

275
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:46,865
So, are we going to play or what?

276
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,867
[paint gun fires]

277
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,436
You try, Mr. Rush. There you go.

278
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,539
How accurate are these things?

279
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,374
Well, fucking awful, aren't they?

280
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,575
[both chuckles]

281
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,693
No.

282
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,195
[laughing]

283
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,533
[clears throat]

284
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:30,509
[gasps]

285
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,377
[laughing]

286
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,379
Fucking hell.

287
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,615
Looks like you got yourself a target, boys.

288
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,450
All right, then. We start tomorrow morning at eight o'clock.

289
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,285
Fires a little high and to the right.

290
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,354
Coffee?

291
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,490
Tea, I think.

292
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,237
I promised you a new asshole, and I always deliver.

293
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,740
You're such a geek you'd probably miss and shoot yourself.

294
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,342
[laughing]

295
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,311
You know, Alex, you're so cool, man.

296
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,280
If I stay here, I'll freeze up.

297
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:09,948
Fuck you, Jason.

298
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:12,718
Not me, man.

299
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,520
Her.

300
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,226
What are you hot for?

301
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,128
Little Miss Iceberg?

302
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,796
What, are you kidding? I'd love a piece of that ass.

303
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:30,369
You'd need to take Tom Cruise along just to get close to her.

304
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,138
Screw you, man. A lot of women find me attractive.

305
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,506
They like me for my mind.

306
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,643
Yeah, right.

307
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,445
Like the time back in college when you took Lisa Pinelli

308
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,348
back to your room to show her your RAM pack?

309
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,217
You had a black eye for a week.

310
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,253
Mr. Sex Appeal, right.

311
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,454
Fuck you!

312
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,358
You'd have more chance with me than with her.

313
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:54,927
Oh, yeah?

314
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,429
Don't be so sure.

315
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,764
Oh, I'm sure.

316
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:11,276
[Eric chuckles] So, the Swedish shopkeeper says to the man,

317
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,312
"Ball or aerosol?"

318
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,916
And the man says, "No, I want it for under my arms."

319
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,523
Well, um, I think I've said enough.

320
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,361
I think after that last joke, you've said too much.

321
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,630
[chuckles]

322
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,099
Well, we've got a long day tomorrow.

323
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,468
So, I'll wish you both a pleasant good evening.

324
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,669
Good night.

325
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,273
He's a good man.

326
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,841
He is.

327
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,043
I love him dearly.

328
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,646
[sighing]

329
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,415
How long have, uh, Bob and Eric known each other?

330
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,751
They were in the army together.

331
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:54,686
With my father.

332
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,089
Your father?

333
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,523
He died in '62.

334
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,660
I'm sorry.

335
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:07,432
I never knew him. I was born three months after he died.

336
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,570
And Bob and Eric?

337
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,842
They've always been Uncle Bob and Uncle Eric.

338
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,812
They were soldiers together with my father in the army.

339
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,849
They were there when he died.

340
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,853
And so they've always looked after Mum and me.

341
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,424
So, when Mum died, naturally I went to work for Bob.

342
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,796
-I, uh... -Oh, it's okay.

343
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,798
They're happy, they're together again.

344
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:41,700
Life goes on.

345
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,937
And you?

346
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,473
Me?

347
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,776
With Bob.

348
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:59,117
Bob's a good man. Really, he is.

349
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,356
He's... He's just been under a little pressure lately.

350
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,126
I know he can be pushy and temperamental and...

351
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,565
But he's a good man. Really.

352
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,500
He is. He's...

353
00:22:17,803 --> 00:22:20,505
[sighing] He's Uncle Bob.

354
00:22:28,814 --> 00:22:32,451
Well... [clears throat] it's getting late.

355
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,922
-I think we should turn in. -Yes.

356
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:38,990
All right.

357
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:47,532
Good night, Simon.

358
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:49,768
Good night.

359
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,413
-[footsteps] -[wolf howling]

360
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,448
Hello, Jason.

361
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,952
What?

362
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,787
I was kind of hoping we might...

363
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,160
toast some marshmallows?

364
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,428
[Yvonne chuckles]

365
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,929
I don't think so.

366
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,132
It's been a long day.

367
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:26,037
[mimicking violin] I noticed.

368
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:30,442
Good night, Jason.

369
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,529
We begin in one hour.

370
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,004
Have fun.

371
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:00,672
I will.

372
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:01,907
It's only a game.

373
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,777
It's gonna be fun.

374
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,480
Besides, these guys have bitten off more than they can chew.

375
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,985
Just be careful.

376
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,922
You got it.

377
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,971
Hey, Rush, you'll need these.

378
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,576
Food and water in the bag.

379
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,978
Put the camo on, and we start soon.

380
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,948
-Thanks, Alex. -No problem. I'll see you.

381
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,953
Not if I see you first, pilgrim.

382
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:52,190
Bang bang, you're dead.

383
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,528
[paint gun firing]

384
00:24:58,296 --> 00:24:59,931
[Jason] That's bloody marvelous.

385
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,566
I think I'm gonna join Mr. Rush.

386
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:08,607
Gentlemen.

387
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,009
Hello, Mr. Rush.

388
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,878
Come here, I've got something for you.

389
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,312
-[Simon] Really? -[Bob] Yeah.

390
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,184
Here, take these. They might be good for your nerves.

391
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,589
Why thank you... Mr. Jenkins.

392
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,559
Are we all ready then?

393
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:30,962
Right.

394
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:35,967
Okay, Mr. Rush. You have 15 minutes.

395
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,136
Off you go.

396
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:40,572
Good luck.

397
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,220
[paint gun firing]

398
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:00,191
Oh, bloody good shot, Eric. Bloody good, yeah.

399
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,028
[Simon grunts]

400
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,861
Right.

401
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:42,867
Gentlemen.

402
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:44,669
Shall we?

403
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,710
I'll take point. Let's go.

404
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,113
[indistinct conversations]

405
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,834
Jenkins.

406
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,492
There's no way he'd come up here.

407
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,595
Why don't you give your mouth a chance, pinhead?

408
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,297
Hey, Bob!

409
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,466
What do you think he's going to do now?

410
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,736
I think you guys should shut up and keep your eyes open.

411
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:28,740
No need to get so tense, Bob. It's only a game.

412
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:32,043
It was never a fucking game!

413
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,557
Keep an eye open on the trees.

414
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:29,400
Now... let's see who hunts who.

415
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,416
[laughter]

416
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,352
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

417
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,488
Too bad, Eric. We'll see you back at the camp, hey?

418
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,924
Okay, lads, good hunting.

419
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,161
Get ready to move out.

420
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,196
Go!

421
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,522
Do either of you see the bastard?

422
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,959
I can't see shit to spit at, man.

423
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,228
Same here.

424
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:31,829
[Bob] All right. Alex, go right.

425
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,598
Jason, cut left.

426
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,301
Head out about 100 yards and then over the hill.

427
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,769
I'm going to lay down covering fire

428
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:39,137
and I'm gonna follow you.

429
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,039
Well, move it, come on!

430
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:13,771
[chuckling] Nice try, buddy boy!

431
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,106
I'll see you around!

432
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,511
[inaudible]

433
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:58,816
Shit!

434
00:31:58,883 --> 00:32:00,485
Smart son of a bitch, huh?

435
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,420
All right, don't write a book about it!

436
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,722
He's gone over the ridge. Come on, after him!

437
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,272
-[paint gun firing] -Shit!

438
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:26,544
-[Simon] I thought you'd wanna get your money's worth, pal! -Shit!

439
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,147
All right. You two go around the ridge. You go down there.

440
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,316
I'm gonna go over the top. I'm gonna try and flush him out.

441
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,685
We'll meet at the plane crash.

442
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,987
If you hear shooting, you make for the sound. Now move out!

443
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,657
Sounds good to me.

444
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,493
If Bob said, "Napalm the guy," you'd think it was okay.

445
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:44,362
Fuck, yeah.

446
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:34,379
Keep your eyes open. The next time, it'll be Rush painting your ass blue.

447
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,118
I wonder what Bruce would advise.

448
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,588
That computer of yours would tell us to nuke the fucker.

449
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:46,958
[chuckling] Agent Orange, huh?

450
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,259
The great American way!

451
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,096
Hey, what do you say we like, uh, you know, just...

452
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,065
Hey, Jay.

453
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,033
Don't try to walk, talk, and think all at the same time.

454
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,802
Your brain can't handle that kind of input.

455
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,404
Erase yourself, dip shit.

456
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,441
Yeah, I reckon we pick up the pace a little,

457
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,910
try and beat the man back to the wreck.

458
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:09,213
Yeah, just don't forget that Rush is still out there.

459
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,749
Oh, he got lucky with Eric.

460
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,951
But we'll nail him and be home before dark.

461
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,219
[Jason] Fuckin' A, bro.

462
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:39,277
[footsteps]

463
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,128
[Bob] So, nothing?

464
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,630
[Alex] Not a sign.

465
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:02,333
My guess, he's high-tailing into the bush.

466
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,534
Don't be so sure.

467
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:05,570
Shit.

468
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,248
He's been making fools out of us the whole fucking day.

469
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:20,918
I mean, I don't know who's hunting who anymore.

470
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,321
[heavy thud]

471
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,859
Ha-ha, buddy boy!

472
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,361
I could have shot any one of you!

473
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:33,231
I thought I'd give you your money's worth, pal!

474
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:37,602
-[paint gun firing] -Oh!

475
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,041
Shit!

476
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:45,810
Ha-ha, Bobby!

477
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:48,579
I'll let you boys off this time.

478
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,648
I'll catch you later, guys.

479
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,288
Shit!

480
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,193
I've had it with this clown. Here.

481
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,953
[clicking]

482
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,755
You can't be serious, man. We can't go after this guy for real.

483
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:31,822
It's murder!

484
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,126
I don't see any problem.

485
00:36:35,192 --> 00:36:37,562
You came out here to hunt, I'm saying let's hunt.

486
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,363
Yeah, but, Bob, we're talking about a fucking human being here,

487
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,565
not an animal.

488
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:45,169
What he is, is a sly bastard

489
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,906
whose been making fools out of us for the entire fucking day!

490
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,708
Yeah, but that's no reason to kill a guy.

491
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,377
Why not?

492
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,279
-I mean, who'd know? -We'd know!

493
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,014
So?

494
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,784
-What about the authorities? -What about them?

495
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,186
Rush crossed the border illegally.

496
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,522
I'm saying let's hunt him, not fuck around with these pop guns!

497
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:05,823
It's not right!

498
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,526
Right? Out here?

499
00:37:08,593 --> 00:37:10,861
We decide what's right.

500
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:13,264
Yeah, but what are we gonna tell Yvonne and Eric?

501
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:14,966
Well...

502
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,402
We'll say he shot at us.

503
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,706
We had to shoot back.

504
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,040
You know, I'll say one of my guns is missing.

505
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,412
So what'll it be, lads?

506
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:37,588
All right.

507
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:58,542
[sighing]

508
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:32,443
All right.

509
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,478
Follow the river.

510
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:20,591
[gunshot]

511
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,697
It's not like you to miss.

512
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:28,466
Let him run a little.

513
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:30,768
See if he likes it.

514
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:37,641
Shit.

515
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,023
[Bob chuckling]

516
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,793
He's headed for higher ground.

517
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,695
Trying to stay out of our way.

518
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,196
What if he decides to cut out?

519
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,066
Where to?

520
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,168
The Leopard Lounge is 40 miles from here.

521
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,604
The nearest town is twice as much. No, no.

522
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,439
No, no. He's going nowhere.

523
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,777
Look. You and Jay go back to the camp. Follow the river.

524
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,045
I'll try and flush him out.

525
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,883
You tell Yvonne and Eric what I told you.

526
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,451
And then keep quiet.

527
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,853
I'll deal with them later.

528
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,058
All right, lads, off you go.

529
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:58,088
All right, Mr. Rush.

530
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,260
It's you and me now.

531
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,709
We're in deep shit, Alex. Bob's lost it.

532
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:19,910
Tell me about it.

533
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,079
Look, I'm going to tell Eric.

534
00:41:22,947 --> 00:41:24,782
You fucking crazy?

535
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,750
How the hell else are we going to stop this?

536
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,352
You cross him, he'll kill you. You saw his eyes.

537
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,753
Yeah, but he's gonna do Rush.

538
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,288
Rather him than us.

539
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:36,293
Without Bob, the Pentagon deal is right down the toilet.

540
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,463
I don't give a fuck about the deal, man. This is first-degree murder.

541
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,131
Look. Just play along.

542
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,734
When he calms down...

543
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,069
we'll get him to call off this shit.

544
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,204
Then...

545
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:50,274
All right. I'll play along, okay?

546
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,076
But I'm not gonna shoot to kill for nobody.

547
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,245
Agreed.

548
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:06,657
We'll get into camp.

549
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:07,892
Just play it cool.

550
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,529
Yeah.

551
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,064
Just like the man told us, huh?

552
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,242
[gunshot]

553
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,978
[grunts, panting]

554
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,726
Why the hell did I get into this shit?

555
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,230
Should have stayed in the fucking war zone.

556
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:28,198
[Bob] Are you having fun, Mr. Rush?

557
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:30,267
What the hell are you doing, Jenkins?

558
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:32,503
[chuckles]

559
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,638
Well, I'm playing the game, eh, as agreed.

560
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:37,074
[Simon] You crazy son of a bitch, this is no game.

561
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,109
That depends on how you look at it, eh?

562
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,278
Yeah, real funny, you bastard.

563
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:45,315
-Why, huh? -Why not?

564
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:48,352
I'll come looking for you in the morning.

565
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:51,121
[in American accent] I'll come a-looking for you, you hear?

566
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,790
[laughs]

567
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,726
Hey, Jenkins!

568
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:59,763
-Jenkins! -[Jenkins laughing]

569
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,301
A game.

570
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,905
That piece of shit.

571
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:19,116
[Yvonne] I still say this is absurd.

572
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:20,684
Simon's no killer.

573
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,186
[Eric] Yvonne's right,

574
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:24,421
and, besides, he had no gun.

575
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,990
I must say, I don't understand this.

576
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,126
I told you...

577
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,161
Bob thinks Rush might have stolen one of his guns.

578
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,896
He said nothing to me.

579
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,836
I don't know.

580
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,938
I... guess he doesn't want you to worry.

581
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,108
This is all crazy.

582
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,079
-That's exactly what it is. -Bob, you scared me.

583
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:51,815
You all right, old son?

584
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:54,118
[scoffs] Yeah, I'm fine.

585
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:57,955
No thanks to our friend out there.

586
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,225
Well, you've, uh...

587
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,559
heard about the turn of events, have you?

588
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,562
Yes, I must say it baffles me.

589
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,665
Yeah.

590
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,868
He fired at me when I was up at the ridge.

591
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:12,836
I fired back...

592
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,839
I think I, uh, scared him off...

593
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,475
into the bush.

594
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:21,445
Yeah.

595
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:26,416
Crazy bastard, isn't he?

596
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:30,487
Is that whiskey?

597
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:35,425
-Yeah. -Yeah, cheers.

598
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:42,432
Mmm.

599
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,571
Yeah, well, I...

600
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:50,874
I think I'll go wash up.

601
00:46:57,781 --> 00:46:58,982
[dogs barking in distance]

602
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,956
[Alex] I'm taking my pump action when we go out tomorrow.

603
00:47:06,023 --> 00:47:07,758
No sense in screwing around.

604
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,326
[Eric] Well, I think we should head for the bar

605
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,128
and contact the authorities.

606
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,997
[Alex] No need for that, we can handle it.

607
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:18,001
[Eric] But somebody may get hurt.

608
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:19,203
[Alex] No problem.

609
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,578
[Alex] I know who's going to get hurt.

610
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:29,646
Not one of us.

611
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:32,816
[Jason] Alex, will you pass me that whiskey, please?

612
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:35,485
[Yvonne] Yeah, Eric's right, we should go to the authorities.

613
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,228
No police.

614
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:47,931
Bob... please.

615
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:53,570
[groans]

616
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:03,480
I suggest we all turn in.

617
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:06,383
We have a busy day tomorrow.

618
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:10,687
Alex, you take the first watch.

619
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:14,124
I'll do the last one.

620
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,061
Then you two can split the rest.

621
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:23,700
Good night.

622
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,984
[Alex] What the fuck's the matter with you?

623
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:42,719
You lost your tongue?

624
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:44,187
You really would shoot him, wouldn't you?

625
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,123
Don't be an idiot, Jason,

626
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,158
I'm doing it to get Jenkins off our backs.

627
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:51,028
Now, go get some sleep.

628
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,063
Everything is gonna be all right.

629
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,748
[sighs] Well...

630
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:14,551
I suppose I should get this shit over with.

631
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:21,158
[blowing]

632
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,633
[Eric] Bob... do you mind?

633
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,601
[Bob] No, come in.

634
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,138
-Sit down. -[Eric] Yeah.

635
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:46,683
-You want a drink? -Yes. Thanks, old son.

636
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,922
-Here, cheers. -Cheers.

637
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:53,123
Hmm.

638
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:02,332
Tents, campfire...

639
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:04,768
it's like old times.

640
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,306
[Bob] Hmm.

641
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,776
Khaki gods, eh?

642
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:15,612
-We were the best. -[gun cocks]

643
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,482
Ah, that's a long time ago.

644
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:21,184
A lot of water's flown under the bridge since then.

645
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,157
We've come a long way, though.

646
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:29,760
This deal will make us.

647
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,094
Oh, we've come far.

648
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,197
Too far to destroy it all.

649
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,168
Bob... we should go for help.

650
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:41,638
Bob, this Rush business is turning...

651
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,706
Eric.

652
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:44,541
He's mine.

653
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,977
Mine!

654
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,645
Don't get in my way!

655
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:50,273
[Simon] Eric. Give me the gun.

656
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:52,642
Give me the gun.

657
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:54,578
Slowly.

658
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,187
-What the hell do you think-- -Shut up.

659
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:06,690
Shut up and let me think.

660
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:08,492
Don't you think you should have done that

661
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,026
before you started shooting today?

662
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:11,728
Before I started shooting?

663
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,663
Eric, I just held you up with this splat gun.

664
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,265
Do you really think I started this thing?

665
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,236
Well, I'd like to believe you, but...

666
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,438
[both grunt]

667
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:22,639
-[thuds] -[Eric grunts]

668
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:25,942
That was stupid, man.

669
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:27,944
That was fucking stupid.

670
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:04,981
Hey, Yvonne?

671
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:06,616
Why, Simon? Why?

672
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,752
Listen to me. I didn't do anything.

673
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,720
One minute I'm in the bush, playing this game,

674
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:11,955
and the next, bullets are whizzing past me.

675
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,590
But why?

676
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,425
Why should they start shooting for real?

677
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:17,394
I don't know, I can't figure it out.

678
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,429
All I know is that I've got to get the hell out of here.

679
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:21,331
I'm gonna take the Land Rover.

680
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:22,799
You can't.

681
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,601
Bob removed the rotor arm.

682
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:27,337
Oh, shit.

683
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:28,772
All right.

684
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,676
Then I'm just gonna hide out until you guys leave.

685
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:35,011
I don't want to fight, not like this.

686
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:39,015
I want to come with you.

687
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,119
-No, no way. -Please, Simon.

688
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:45,589
-Uh-uh. -Bob's been drinking heavily, and...

689
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,428
He hit me tonight.

690
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:01,938
All right.

691
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,041
Take this bag...

692
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:07,410
and keep your gun.

693
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:10,780
-Let's go. -What about the guard? He's--

694
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,983
No, I took care of him on the way in.

695
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:14,718
I wanted to leave Bob a little message,

696
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:16,853
so that he'd know I was here.

697
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,055
Let's get out of this place.

698
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,161
[Simon] I found this place just before sundown.

699
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,297
-Whoa! -[crashing]

700
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,066
Whoa, be careful.

701
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,838
Other than loose rocks, I think it's pretty safe.

702
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,344
There's an overhang down here

703
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:44,147
that should conceal the light and the smoke from the fire.

704
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,650
So we'll just hole up here until they move out.

705
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,422
I hope we don't sleep walk.

706
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,759
[chuckles] So do I.

707
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:14,444
And when we got divorced...

708
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:17,814
she won custody of the kid.

709
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:24,487
[grunts] There wasn't much left for me in New York, so, uh...

710
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:29,726
I took the overseas assignment and I've war hopped ever since.

711
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:36,499
I send my ex-wife money for our daughter, but, uh, well...

712
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:39,969
She seems to like it that way.

713
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,005
And you?

714
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:52,482
When there's a war going on...

715
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,053
and you're face down in the dirt...

716
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,522
trying to keep your head on its shoulders...

717
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:04,627
you tend not to think of your wife's lover...

718
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,764
driving your little girl to school.

719
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:15,505
I'm glad I came with you.

720
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:20,744
Bob really scares me.

721
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,081
And I don't?

722
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:29,786
No.

723
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,742
Good morning.

724
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:58,982
-It's beautiful country. -Hmm.

725
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:01,918
It certainly is.

726
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,588
[Alex] Take a look at this.

727
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:08,525
[Jason] I think I'm gonna be sick.

728
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,894
[Bob] Bastard.

729
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:13,163
Bastard!

730
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:29,112
[Simon clears throat]

731
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,584
What are you looking at, Mr. Rush?

732
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:39,155
This really is beautiful country.

733
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,260
[men grunting]

734
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,167
Put him on his bed, we'll bury him tonight.

735
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:02,612
Hey, where's Yvonne?

736
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:04,781
Well, she's not in her tent, so she's with Rush, right?

737
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,382
Why'd she go with Rush? He killed Eric, man.

738
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:08,051
They were getting pretty cute.

739
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:09,652
What are we gonna do, Bob? Eric's dead!

740
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:11,221
Don't be a dick all your life.

741
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:12,822
Get your stuff together, we move now!

742
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:17,961
[Simon] Hopefully, they'll take the hint

743
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:19,696
and get the hell out of here.

744
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:29,372
The way I ran rings around those guys yesterday,

745
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:33,042
it shouldn't be too difficult to persuade them to give it up.

746
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:36,646
And then you and I...

747
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:40,016
will live happily ever after.

748
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:44,654
I hope to God you're right.

749
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,125
Bob can be stubborn when he wants to.

750
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,426
Hey...

751
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:52,095
I'm sure it'll be okay.

752
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,500
Look, I'm gonna head out to camp

753
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:58,701
and see what they're doing.

754
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:02,071
I'll be back in a minute.

755
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:09,946
Mmm. Good stuff.

756
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:12,048
I'll improve, I promise.

757
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:13,783
Bye.

758
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,591
Hey.

759
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,793
Be careful.

760
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,695
And ruin a great track record?

761
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:27,664
I'll see you soon.

762
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:32,735
[chuckles]

763
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:56,893
What's that?

764
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,595
What do you think it is?

765
00:59:59,662 --> 01:00:01,197
No fucking around with you, right?

766
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,099
Oh, no.

767
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,101
I thought I'd give Mr. Rush some special treatment.

768
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:08,604
You're right, let's get him.

769
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:10,773
All right, we'll split up.

770
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,009
I'm gonna go down to the river near where we saw him yesterday.

771
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:14,911
I want you to go south, below the ridge,

772
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:16,713
and you to go north, above it.

773
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:17,914
Right!

774
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:23,252
Oh, and, lads...

775
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:25,722
no more games.

776
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:28,424
You shoot to kill.

777
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:54,744
[birds cawing in distance]

778
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:25,808
[screaming]

779
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:17,994
I've got you, you mother...

780
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,128
Hey, you don't have to do this, man.

781
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:20,596
Shut your mouth!

782
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,064
I wouldn't let you go,

783
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,100
not after what you did to Eric.

784
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,501
-What? What are you talking about? -Shut up!

785
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:27,570
[grunting]

786
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:33,843
[both grunting]

787
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,414
[groans] My back!

788
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:00,570
[grunts]

789
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:24,327
[grunts]

790
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:32,395
[Alex] Jason.

791
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,268
Jason. [panting]

792
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:41,103
-It's Rush! -[gunshot]

793
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,605
Alex! Jesus!

794
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:50,579
[screams] Ah! Oh, God. Alex!

795
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:52,648
Don't die, man! Just fight it, man!

796
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:54,617
-[Alex groans] -Let me get help.

797
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:56,052
Don't talk. Don't talk. Just fight it, man!

798
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,486
Stay alive, Alex.

799
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:59,121
Just stay alive, I need you, man.

800
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:01,590
Bob? Bob!

801
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:04,360
What happened? I heard shots.

802
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:06,962
Rush shot him in the back, man.

803
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:08,297
Oh, my God, he's dead!

804
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,735
[crying]

805
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:37,860
My God, what happened?

806
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:40,329
[groans] I tripped on the way down here.

807
01:06:41,297 --> 01:06:42,865
What happened?

808
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:44,767
Alex and I had a little disagreement.

809
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:47,870
Disagreement? Where are they?

810
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,405
[sighs] Come on, Vonnie,

811
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,140
I just want to get this cleaned up.

812
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:53,843
[sighs]

813
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:55,578
Okay, let's get you down to the river.

814
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:56,779
All right.

815
01:06:58,214 --> 01:07:00,216
[inaudible]

816
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:21,170
[sobbing]

817
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:43,859
[Bob] We commit their bodies to the ground.

818
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:47,863
Ashes to ashes...

819
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:50,132
dust to dust.

820
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:57,706
[clears throat]

821
01:07:59,508 --> 01:08:01,110
Come on, son.

822
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:33,409
[Bob] Getting late.

823
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:38,247
Wait.

824
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:40,549
Look.

825
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:43,118
Let's get that motherfucker.

826
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:44,320
Now, wait, wait, wait.

827
01:08:45,588 --> 01:08:47,256
We'll take him in the morning.

828
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:50,059
-Let him feel safe. -No, Bob. Come on!

829
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:51,260
[grunts]

830
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:53,829
Take it easy.

831
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:04,206
Okay.

832
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:06,475
[sighs]

833
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:07,943
In the morning, Rush.

834
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:20,956
[Jason] Hey, buddy.

835
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:26,729
[crying] Oh, man.

836
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,732
What can I say?

837
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:38,374
How am I gonna make it without you, Alex?

838
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:50,953
I'm going to get him, Alex.

839
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:54,089
Rush is gonna pay!

840
01:09:54,156 --> 01:09:56,992
I promise you that if it's the last thing I do.

841
01:09:59,662 --> 01:10:00,996
I promise you, man.

842
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,233
I promise!

843
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:07,636
[Bob] Here.

844
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,371
You're too drunk to stand guard.

845
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:11,907
-Go to bed. -Bob, I...

846
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:14,910
Go to bed!

847
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:40,936
Well, Mr. Rush, here's to you.

848
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:48,344
-[gun cocks] -Rush?

849
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:50,613
It's me, Bob.

850
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:54,683
Vonnie...

851
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:57,853
where have you been?

852
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,722
I've been worried about you.

853
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:01,423
That would be a first in a long time.

854
01:11:04,259 --> 01:11:05,394
Yeah, that's not fair.

855
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:09,665
-What happened to us? -You happened!

856
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:12,368
You don't care about anyone anymore, Bob.

857
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:14,403
You just walk over everyone.

858
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:15,971
-Look-- -That's far enough!

859
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:17,773
Yvonne...

860
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,443
Call off this crazy game, Bob.

861
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:24,713
I don't know why you're doing it.

862
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,682
Call it off before somebody gets hurt.

863
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:28,851
It's too late for that.

864
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,153
Alex and Eric are dead.

865
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,588
Your friend killed them.

866
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:36,959
Uncle Eric?

867
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:38,927
He's dead, Yvonne.

868
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,930
Dead!

869
01:11:41,997 --> 01:11:44,667
Now... I don't know why Rush started this...

870
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:46,835
but I intend to finish it.

871
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:49,805
-Oh, Yvonne-- -Stay where you are!

872
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:51,874
I've got to... I've got to think.

873
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:54,977
I can't believe you!

874
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:56,779
Vonnie!

875
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,748
I buried them today!

876
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,583
I'll show you their bloody graves!

877
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,118
Look...

878
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:05,587
Rush is a sick man!

879
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,526
We can take him alive if you help us.

880
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:11,794
We can...

881
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:15,130
We can get him to medical care.

882
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:17,566
But I can't do it without you.

883
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:20,469
What can I do?

884
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:22,838
That's my girl.

885
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:25,007
Empty his gun.

886
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:27,643
We'll come for you in the morning.

887
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:28,877
We know where you are.

888
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,480
You do?

889
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:33,148
Yes.

890
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:37,386
You won't hurt him, Bob?

891
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:38,587
No.

892
01:12:39,621 --> 01:12:40,756
Please.

893
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:43,892
I've got to think.

894
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,062
I'll talk to Simon.

895
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:49,164
No, don't do that, he's a nutter!

896
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:51,400
He'll hurt you.

897
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:57,706
I'll, uh, see you in the morning, then.

898
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,052
They're on the other side of those rocks.

899
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:47,456
Now, go around that way and be quiet.

900
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:50,492
Now, wait for me to fire.

901
01:13:51,226 --> 01:13:52,461
At Yvonne?

902
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:54,997
I don't know.

903
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:57,065
What do you think?

904
01:13:57,766 --> 01:13:58,901
[chuckles]

905
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:36,104
[sighs]

906
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:50,786
[groans]

907
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:53,155
-Simon-- -Shh!

908
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:57,292
-Is it Bob? -It's not the Easter bunny, honey.

Stay here, I'll be back in a minute.

No, wait! We should talk to him, try and reason with him.

911
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:05,334
Yvonne, the man has a machine gun with my name on it.

912
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,703
I'm not about to ask the son of a bitch to dance.

we meet again.

923

I see Yvonne did her job well.

She and I, uh...

926
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:51,740
She and I came to a little agreement last night.

927
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:56,578
-Yvonne? -Yeah.

928
01:16:56,645 --> 01:17:01,249
I imagined to persuade her that you are a violent man in need of help.

929

Listen, I don't understand. I, uh...

[chuckles] Hello, Vonnie.

935
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:17,733
Here, put the gun down before someone gets hurt.

936
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:20,435

Why am I doing this?

942
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:37,352
You killed my partners!

943
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,822
-What? -I didn't kill anybody!

944
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:44,326
Relax, Mr. Rush.

945
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:45,761
I know you didn't.

946
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:48,830

[stutters] Wait a minute, who's dead?

951

Eric and Alex are dead, Simon.

952
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:01,977
You killed Alex?

953
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:03,979
And Uncle Eric?

954
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,148
Why?

955
01:18:07,682 --> 01:18:09,251
Well, I had to.

956
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:11,053
It's all a question of mathematics.

957
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:13,755
It's the defense contract.

958
01:18:14,823 --> 01:18:17,025
Oh, very good, Mr. Rush.

959
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,928
You see, with those guys dead,

960
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:21,897

961
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:23,398
[Yvonne] You killed them!

962
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:26,868
You killed Uncle Eric for money?

963
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:29,504
It's not just money, Yvonne.

964
01:18:29,571 --> 01:18:32,040
It's like he says, it's a bloody fortune.

970
01:18:43,518 --> 01:18:46,188

971
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:49,191

972
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:53,261
