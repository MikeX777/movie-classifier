1
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,560
So my first kiss was with a girl.

2
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,150
Her name was Yuri.

3
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,560
It sounds like a joke, but it's not.

She was on the softball team.

9
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,620
Popular with the older students.

10
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,250
She got lots of chocolates on Valentine's Day.

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,990
Hoshino
Etsumi

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,090
And now she's getting married.

20
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,400
Coming.

21
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,040
Hoshino residence.

22
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,930
Ecchan?

23
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,530
So loud!

24
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,420
It's me, Takeda! Takeda Yuri!

25
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,490
Oh, hey.

26
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,860
Has the postcard arrived?

27
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,340
I already responded.

28
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:46,920
Huh?

29
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,160
So, are you coming, or...

30
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,170
I sure am.

31
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,020
Thank goodness.

32
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm so glad!

33
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,140
Congratulations.

34
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:09,890
And then, on the day of the wedding...

35
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,820
Damn it. I can't believe I cried.

36
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,920
I wonder if she heard me.

37
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,730
She's following me!

38
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,160
Oh, th-thanks.

39
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,290
You're welcome.

40
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,090
How dramatic!

41
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,230
Oh, she's actually kinda pretty.

42
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,130
You're in love with Yuri, aren't you?

43
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:23,740
Huh?

44
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,820
I'm in the same boat.

45
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,220
Can you believe she asked me to make a speech?

46
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,980
Wanna grab some drinks?

47
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,890
S-Sure.

48
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,700
She definitely heard me.

49
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,290
Come over to my house.

50
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,950
Um...

51
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,630
I won't try anything weird.

52
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,530
My place is just around the corner.

53
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,940
Come on.

54
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,340
But...

55
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,540
I won't do anything!

56
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:06,380
Ahem

57
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:06,420
Ahem

58
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:06,460

00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:06,630
Ahem

00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:06,670
Ahem

Ahem

66
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:06,790
Ahem

67
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,840
Ahem

68
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:06,880
Ahem

69
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:06,920
Ahem

70
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:06,960
Ahem

71
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,000
Ahem

72
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,040
Ahem

73
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,090
Ahem

74
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:07,130

Ahem

77
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:07,250
Ahem

78
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,800
Liar.

79
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:07,290
Ahem

80
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:07,340
Ahem

81
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,380
Ahem

82
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:07,420
Ahem

83
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:07,460
Ahem

84
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:07,500
Ahem

85
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:07,550
Ahem

86
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:07,590
Ahem

87
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:07,630
Ahem

88
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:07,670
Ahem

89
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,710
Ahem

90
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:07,750
Ahem

91
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:07,800
Ahem

92
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:07,840
Ahem

93
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:07,880
Ahem

94
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:07,920
Ahem

95
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:07,960
Ahem

96
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,000
Ahem

97
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,050
Ahem

98
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:08,090
Ahem

99
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:08,130
Ahem

100
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:08,170
Ahem

101
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:08,210
Ahem

102
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:08,250
Ahem

103
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:08,300
Ahem

104
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:08,340
Ahem

105
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:08,380
Ahem

106
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:08,420
Ahem

107
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:08,460
Ahem

108
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:08,500
Ahem

109
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:08,550
Ahem

110
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:08,590
Ahem

111
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:08,630
Ahem

112
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:08,670
Ahem

113
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:08,710
Ahem

114
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,750
Ahem

115
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,270
This way!

116
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,470
Hell yeah!

117
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,090
Here we are. Apartment 502.

118
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,530
Oh crap.

119
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,420
It's a complete mess.

120
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:39,770
Sorry, but I'm starting to feel sick.

121
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,400
Like you're gonna puke?

122
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,830
I'm not sure.

123
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,810
But I want to lie down.

124
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,030
Are you okay?

125
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,960
Lying down really helped.

126
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,550
I touched your boobs.

127
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,830
See? You lied.

128
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,540
Off it goes!

129
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,520
S-Stop...

130
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,780
It's too late for that.

131
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,240
But...

132
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,380
What was Yuri like in high school?

133
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,520
She was really popular.

134
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,000
Was she in junior college too?

135
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,090
Nah, not really.

136
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,240
Everyone was boy crazy.

137
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,390
She talked about you a lot.

138
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,620
How you were her girlfriend in high school.

139
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,360
In high school...

140
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,660
Sorry. Don't cry.

141
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,180
I mean, I'm also her ex from college, so...

142
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,120
Honestly, she was infuriating.

143
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,420
You can say that again.

144
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,020
Though it'd be our mistake to ever think she was sensitive.

145
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,540
I know what you mean.

146
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:05,880
Two adult tickets.

147
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,240
Huh? It's fine. I can pay for myself.

148
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,150
Nah, it's on me.

149
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,840
I'm getting lunch, then.

150
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,100
Sure thing.

151
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,280
I-It's freezing!

152
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,040
Wanna go somewhere?

153
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,500
Wanna come over to my place?

154
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,650
Sure.

155
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,560
I guess we're not finished ranting about Yuri yet.

156
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,400
Right?

157
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,150
Hoshino

158
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,650
Thanks for having me.

159
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,360
It's not as spacious as your place.

160
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,070
It's really cute. I love it.

161
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,900
Do you have any yearbooks?

162
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,290
Wanna see Yuri, huh?

163
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,010
Takeda Yuri

164
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:57,010
Wow, her hair's so short!

165
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,250
Like a boy.

166
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:03,920
She started growing out her hair toward the end of high school.

167
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,650
She asked me out around the time that photo was taken.

168
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,540
Oh yeah?

169
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,600
She kissed me out of the blue.

170
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,360
And then just ran off.

171
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,030
She always was impulsive.

172
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,030
Where are you?

173
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,260
Never mind me.

174
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,220
Why not?

175
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,290
Hoshino
Etsumi

176
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,290
There you are.

177
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,940
So cute!

178
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,880
Jeez! Drink your tea already!

179
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,160
I see.

180
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,180
By this time, you two were already...

181
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,610
I see.

182
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,100
Must've been nice.

183
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,410
Ecchan...

184
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,240
Your boobs...

185
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,400
Oh, is my hair in the way?

186
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,840
Yeah, a little.

187
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,520
I like you better with your hair down.

188
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,100
You do?

189
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,710
I'll keep it down since you like it, then.

190
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,170
What was Yuri to us, anyway?

191
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,660
A mirage?

192
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,910
A total slut.

193
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,280
But she led me to you.

194
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,840
I'm blushing.

195
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,160
It's so anticlimactic.

196
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,570
Wednesday,\h\h
March 15th

197
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,570
Day duty:
\hMiyagi

198
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,540
I'll hand out your diplomas in alphabetical order,
so come up when I call your name.

199
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,440
First: Adachi Takahiro.

200
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,160
Yes, sir.

201
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,210
How lame.

202
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,320
Graduation should be held in a gym.

203
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,250
And be sentimental.

204
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,780
Second: Aramoto Masaki.

205
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,220
Yes, sir.

206
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,040
Also, with a female teacher...

207
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,350
See ya!

208
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,820
Bye!

209
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,860
Wanna go to Shimokita? Or Kichijouji?

210
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,230
Sounds good.

211
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,620
No emotion whatsoever.

212
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,960
A love letter would've been nice.

213
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,290
Though this is an all-boys school.

214
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,390
Mr. Sawa.

215
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,290
Yes?

216
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,840
He says he's from your class.

217
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,450
He was nervously waiting outside.

218
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,790
I'm not nervous, though.

219
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,360
You came all the way here to tell me that?

220
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,570
No.

221
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,830
Do you have a girlfriend?

222
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,740
Have any spare lead?

223
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,620
Nope, no girlfriend.

224
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,570
Is that what you came to ask?

225
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,300
No, not really. Well, actually, yeah.

226
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,420
Though I've been told I should "settle down already."

227
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,540
Oh, get married, you mean.

228
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:06,100
Marriage. Right.

229
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,350
Let's stop talking about my non-existent wife.

230
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,460
I mean, yeah, I guess.

231
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,090
You have a beautiful neck.

232
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,090
I'm in love with you.

233
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,670
What's up, Yagasaki?

234
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,940
Oh, I just forgot something.

235
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,150
But I found it.

236
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,570
If you'll excuse me.

237
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:53,610
Sure.

238
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,040
It's an exercise in futility.

239
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,850
My students just aren't motivated at all.

240
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,000
It's not a matter of seriousness.

241
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,070
More like they just don't care what happens in the world.

242
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,210
I totally get that.

243
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,680
Have a nice night!

244
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,260
Bye!

245
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,520
Shall we go?

246
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,670
Yeah, I've definitely had too much to drink.

247
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,480
The year just flew by.

248
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,020
Hey...

249
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,900
Yes?

250
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,170
Never mind.

251
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,550
Aw, what is it?

252
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,830
Now I'm curious!

253
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,260
Yagasaki Shinya

254
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,220
I'm in love with you.

255
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,190
Oh man.

256
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,940
I could die right now.

257
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:24,830
I'm like a blushing young schoolgirl dreaming of a rosy future.

258
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,910
A shiny, bright dream.

259
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,420
But that was a year ago.

260
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,900
Nothing ever came of it.

261
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,060
We will now commence our graduation ceremony.

262
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:53,380
All graduates should return to their classrooms.

263
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,190
At least, I think it was nothing.

264
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,340
Congratulations.

265
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,990
I'll be handing out your diplomas,

266
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,070
so please come up in alphabetical order.

267
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,650
Too obsessed with Yagasaki. Too much fantasizing.

268
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,540
A sweet, sweet fantasy.

269
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,870
Hey, that song's a classic.

270
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,460
I'm touched! Just kidding.

271
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,170
If he fell for another guy, so be it.

272
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:23,010
Acorn Bar

273
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,350
This is the place. It's on the fifth floor.

274
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,720
Welcome!

275
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,230
Table for two.

276
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,690
Certainly.

277
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,040
There's one over there.

278
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,640
Really? That's your sister?

279
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,440
Seriously?

280
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,900
Oh my.

281
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,570
Maybe I'll buy her a beer.

282
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,790
I was shocked to see you.

283
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,940
Me too.

284
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,000
Right?

285
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,470
Tanabe

286
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,470
Tanabe?

287
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,490
We're living together.

288
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,900
Or rather, he's letting me stay.

289
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,070
This used to be an old-timey love hotel.

290
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,410
Oh yeah?

291
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,490
I'm home!

292
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,330
Hey.

293
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,010
Five of us together at once!

294
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,270
Insane, right?

295
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,490
Wow!

296
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,340
Is my neck beautiful?

297
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,030
Huh?

298
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,040
Dunno.

299
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,350
Looks normal to me.

300
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,780
What's that about?

301
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,500
A non-flush toilet!

302
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,830
Sir, I just can't stop pissing.

303
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,340
How lame.

304
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,100
Hurry up in there!

305
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,610
Yoriko.

306
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,980
I love high school kids.

307
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,650
Huh?

308
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:05,740
But they toy with me, the punks.

309
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,740
Yeah, sure. Just go to sleep.

310
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,070
Spittin' image.

311
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,760
Huh?

312
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,450
Of who?

313
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,830
No idea.

314
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,170
How long has it been?

315
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,170
Three years?

316
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,090
Looks like he's been through a lot.

317
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,390
No kidding.

318
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,310
My sister's dancing 'round and 'round.

319
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:33,250
Even though she keeps saying to stop because it's embarrassing.

320
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,330
On second thought,

321
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,830
you look nothing like him.

322
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,470
At all.

323
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,710
Morning.

324
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,280
Morning. Breakfast is almost ready.

325
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,500
Well, I'll see you later.

326
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,300
Bye.

327
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,460
Um...

328
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,060
Please take care of my sister.

329
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,370
There was dancing yesterday.

330
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,650
Who was?

331
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,060
You and your boyfriend.

332
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,560
Oh, stop.

333
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,200
I want to be a part-timer too.

334
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,350
I thought you loved high school kids.

335
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,480
I want to be part of the circle.

336
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,550
Dancing 'round and 'round.

337
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:56,330
Another year flew by.

338
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,680
Our graduation is so lame.

339
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,860
At least it's simple.

340
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:40,140
Tuesday,
March 12th

341
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:40,140
Day duty:
\hSugita

342
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,710
Hey, how about we do a thank-you party for me?

343
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,920
Not ready to say goodbye?

344
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:38,320
I'd really appreciate it if you'd throw a party for me.

345
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,440
What the hell?

346
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,240
Fine.

347
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,480
This one's for you, Mr. Sawa.

348
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,620
You're paying for it, though.

349
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,640
The sky was so beautiful.

350
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:06,200
Maybe that's what made me say it.

351
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,470
Let's go to your place next, Mr. Sawa!

352
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,110
Yeah!

353
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,020
No way. It'd be too cramped.

354
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,690
It'll be fine!

355
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:26,150
We can all squeeze in together!

356
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,590
I guess that's okay.

357
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,280
More than okay...

358
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,070
There's a big, old house I know about.

359
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,080
We can go there.

360
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,870
Yeah!

361
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,690
When I told them it was an old love hotel,

362
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,900
they freaked out.

363
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,570
Which problem are you on?

364
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,820
Number three.

365
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,120
You working hard?

366
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,440
Why don't you take a break
and have some watermelon?

367
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,020
Thank you.

368
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,830
It's so cool in here.

369
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,040
See you tomorrow.

370
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,900
Yeah.

371
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,370
Call Sayo. Dinner will be ready soon.

372
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,100
Okay.

373
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,930
Get out here, Sayoko.

374
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:24,180
It's like a sauna in there!

375
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,190
Of course it is.

376
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,150
But you guys didn't do it!

377
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,360
Of course not!

378
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,010
It's dinnertime.

379
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,840
You're in sixth grade already.

380
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,160
Fifth.

381
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,970
Okay, sit down you two.

382
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,580
Why doesn't she go home?

383
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,700
Sayo was kicked out.

384
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,200
Serves her right.

385
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,060
Let me see the video later.

386
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,880
Sure.

387
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,410
Honey!

388
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,760
You should watch it too, Shin.

389
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,600
You're the devil.

390
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,880
Sleep over tonight.

391
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,380
I'll talk to your dad tomorrow.

392
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,180
You're the best.

393
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,970
Thank you for the food.

394
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,270
Let's eat.

395
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,700
Hey, studying hard?

396
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:25,970
I'm doing way better than when you tutored me.

397
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,910
I gave you a good foundation.

398
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,900
Don't smoke in here!

399
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,350
This is my room, you know!

400
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:39,050
Jeez! You'd better put that stuff back when you're done!

401
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,960
"Talk about your first period or ejaculation with your friends."

402
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,030
Hey, got any hair on your balls yet?

403
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,270
No!

404
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,900
Lemme see while it's still silky smooth!

405
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,560
Get off of me, you pervert!

406
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,230
Mom! She's sexually harassing me!

407
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,630
So smooth!

408
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,100
This is the video?

409
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,930
Yeah.

410
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,200
She graduated from college and then shot that.

411
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,270
What an idiot.

412
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,240
Did you watch it?

413
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,620
No way!

414
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,460
Let's watch it.

415
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,710
What?!

416
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:18,300
Stop it, Mika! We'll get in trouble!

417
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,000
I'll mute it, then.

418
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,010
That's not the point!

419
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,350
Mika, you should have some cold noodles too!

420
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,600
I told you we shouldn't.

421
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,170
There you are.

422
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:07,060
Did you get into a fight?

423
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,680
It's not funny!

424
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,420
Just do it with her already.

425
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,270
I can't do anything like that!

426
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,160
You say that, but I'm sure you're curious.

427
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
Crap! Titties!

428
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,200
What about 'em?

429
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,210
They're huge.

430
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,000
Lemme see your dick!

431
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,220
What's going on up there?

432
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,950
So? Did you see her dad?

433
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,800
I did, but...

434
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,720
"I didn't let her move out on her own to make some awful video."

435
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,550
He wouldn't say a word after that.

436
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,080
Can't say I blame him.

437
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,350
You'd better not have watched that video.

438
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,460
I haven't. I swear.

439
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,260
Mika, you idiot!

440
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,250
Am I in the closet again?

441
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:22,700
I'll sleep in the closet today.

442
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,910
You know, we can both sleep out here.

443
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,360
It's fine. Night.

444
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,330
It's hot...

445
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,120
You'll be steamed alive in there.

446
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,970
Night.

447
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,490
Hello.

448
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,170
Hi, Mika.

449
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,130
I brought cherries.

450
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,960
Oh, thanks.

451
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,220
Shin's washing his underwear right now.

452
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,260
You didn't have to tell her that!

453
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,960
Did you wet your bed?

454
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,970
No.

455
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,400
I didn't!

456
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,380
So don't go spreading rumors!

457
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,870
I won't.

458
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,180
How far did we get yesterday?

459
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,700
Um...

460
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,310
To here.

461
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,690
Are we going to get married?

462
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,830
What the heck?

463
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,470
Have some cherries.

464
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:50,020
I tried one. They're really sweet.

465
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,180
Good.

466
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,200
You too, Sayo.

467
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,590
It's so hot in there!

468
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:03,130
Hey, I'm the lady from the video.

469
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,100
Nice to meet you, Mika.

470
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,150
Sayo.

471
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,880
Coming.

472
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,200
She's my cousin.

473
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,070
Wow, it's really her!

474
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,790
Don't tell anyone in class!

475
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,540
You should come to my place tomorrow.

476
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,810
Okay.

477
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,980
She's got the hots for you.

478
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,900
No, she doesn't.

479
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,570
Jeez, who do you grade schoolers think you are?

480
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:00,200
That's enough! Put your clothes back on!

481
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,410
We're way too young for this!

482
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:07,290
Tateishi in the sixth grade already did it with an eighth grader.

483
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:08,880
Seriously?

484
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:17,430
Are you in love with Sayoko?

485
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,320
How did it come to this?

486
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,470
I'm home.

487
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,540
Welcome back.

488
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,290
You're still here?

489
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,780
I'm leaving tomorrow.

490
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,080
You are?

491
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,270
I know you'll miss me.

492
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,120
Did your dad forgive you?

493
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,170
No way.

494
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:53,760
Did you do it with Mika?

495
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,800
Nope.

496
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,270
Goodnight.

497
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:12,290
But it's still light out.

498
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:13,980
And you should change.

499
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,830
Yeah.

500
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,620
If you're lonely, you should just say so.

501
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,920
I got used to you being around, that's all.

502
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,290
Wanna suck on my titties?

503
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,300
You're the devil.

504
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,980
Sayoko went home?

505
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:23,460
Hey, Sasaki and the others are at the pool.

506
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,900
They'll probably tease us.

507
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,440
I'm home.

508
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,030
They're stubborn, but they wanted to thank us.

509
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,720
Shin.

510
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,570
Washing your underwear again?

511
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,720
Sasaki wrote me a love letter.

512
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,910
Told me to break up with you.

513
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,630
"Promise me you won't show this letter to Shinichi.

514
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,910
If you do, I'll have to challenge him to a duel."

515
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,410
A duel?!

516
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,270
No!

517
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,880
Shin! You start school today.

518
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,590
I don't wanna go!

519
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,880
I'll protect you if it comes down to it.

520
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,780
I haven't done anything wrong.

521
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,950
I will not have anyone fighting in my class!

522
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,640
I'm saved.

523
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,090
I'm home.

524
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,700
Hello.

525
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,150
Do you have more homework?

526
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:22,990
Yes.

527
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,090
Study hard.

528
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,300
We will.

529
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:59,450
I can tell you now that I was lonely.

530
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,250
What are you talking about?

531
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:10,140
When Sayoko was around

532
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:30,870
Shin made me promise not to say anything,

533
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,080
so I wasn't planning on telling anyone.

534
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,730
Hey.

535
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:45,940
Is it true your cousin did porn?

536
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:46,940
So what if she did?

537
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,880
So it's true? Wow!

538
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,410
It was a long time ago.

539
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,720
Have you seen it?

540
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:58,020
Let's go home.

541
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,190
I wish I could see it.

542
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,680
Did you know his cousin was in a porno?

543
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,740
Die.

544
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,770
Yikes.

545
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,820
Are they doing it?

546
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,410
That was ages ago.

547
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,370
Rumors never die.

548
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:24,670
I told Emi not to tell anyone.

549
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:28,110
And I told you not to tell anyone.

550
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,340
But...

551
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,540
Bye.

552
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,430
I'm home.

553
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,290
Hi.

554
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,480
Curry?

555
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,980
Your brother's coming home, so I made it kind of spicy.

556
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:04,890
I hope that's okay.

557
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,430
I'm kind of excited.

558
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,900
Shin's class is doing a haunted house.

559
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,720
Mika's going to sing a solo in her choir.

560
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,380
Really? That's awesome.

561
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,320
We're all going.

562
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,640
Can you make it too?

563
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,700
What time is it?

564
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,380
It starts at one o'clock.

565
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:46,710
37th Annual

566
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:46,710
North Junior High School Festival

567
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,970
It could use some more flowers.

568
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,710
Shall we add a few more?

569
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,900
Still have the video?

570
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,330
Nope.

571
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:29,700
Shin's watching!

572
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,840
I wanted to die.

573
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,180
You're still blushing.

574
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,380
My voice cracked.

575
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,290
I'm so embarrassed.

576
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:46,780
Bye.

577
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:47,610
Yeah.

578
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:14,570
I'm tired of watching this.

579
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:34,890
I still don't know how to make myself cum.

580
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,020
Pretend this is Shin's hand.

581
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,950
I really hate the rain.

582
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,920
I love the rain.

583
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:58,850
If it starts raining when I'm watching TV,
I mute it and listen to the rain.

584
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:00,220
It calms me.

585
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,990
Maybe you're just really tired.

586
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,890
Or you're oddly obsessed with imagining yourself listening to the rain.

587
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:09,100
How rude!

588
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,020
You've changed.

589
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:15,820
Huh?

590
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,130
I liked you better when you were a boy.

591
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:21,690
What's that supposed to mean?

592
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,460
But I still love you.

593
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,020
You and Yabe are pretty close.

594
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:35,810
Right?

595
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:38,100
I voted for you two for best couple.

596
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,110
Me too.

597
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:42,840
Look. They're taking down the sign.

598
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,200
There go the flowers.

599
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,210
Taking all the blackout curtains?

600
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:00,540
Just three of them.

601
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:13,520
I've seen people doing it here.

602
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,650
Emi and I watched in secret.

603
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:22,450
Lots of people do it here.

604
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:24,480
There can't be that many.

605
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,230
I'd do it with you.

606
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:42,580
No way!

607
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,790
Where are the blackout curtains?

608
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,310
Shinichi's getting them.

609
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:47,320
By himself?

610
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:51,720
Actually, he went with, uh... Tokunaga from Class 6.

611
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,170
The two of them...

612
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,640
In here!

613
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,450
Did you do it?

614
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:04,600
Do what?

615
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:14,660
I bet you they did it.

616
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,870
Right?

617
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:28,870
Blackout curtains

618
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,680
I always prefer the day before than the day of.

619
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,370
Huh?

620
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:30,830
The school festival.

621
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:34,270
Oh, yeah... Me too.

622
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:37,920
Don't watch when my class is singing.

623
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:48,510
You just squeezed them.

624
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,640
You never know about these things. Oh, they're back.

625
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,230
I'm home.

626
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:59,310
Sayo's getting married next year!

627
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,070
Isn't that great?

628
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:02,730
Yeah.

629
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:04,300
Where's the wedding?

630
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:05,280
Come in.

631
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:17,300
Are you still mad about before?

632
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:21,290
You said I could.

633
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,760
You said you loved Sayoko.

634
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,290
I never said that!

635
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,600
But I could tell.

636
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,810
It's annoying how you're popular and don't even realize it!

637
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:50,070
I feel better now.

638
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,890
I'm going to start a diary today.

639
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:59,360
My first entry will obviously be "That idiot Sayoko."

640
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,560
Choir recital for each class begins at one o'clock.

641
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:29,480
I guess we got nominated for best couple in eighth grade.

642
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:31,050
Yeah.

643
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:43,080
The prize was a condom. The note attached to it said, "Don't let the teachers find out."

644
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:48,900
We blew it up like a balloon.

645
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,880
Or maybe we didn't.

646
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,490
Happy-Go-Lucky Days

647
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:20,510
I cheekily sat some shampoo bubbles on top of your head

648
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:26,920
I playfully glanced your way and teased you saying you forgot to wash it out

649
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:34,720
After you washed it out., the shampoo ran down your body., but it still smelled the same

650
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:40,980
As fun as it was., it meant we found that our soap supply never lasted long

651
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:49,000
The roads we took were always one and the same

652
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,970
The sky we gazed at was always one and the same

653
00:50:56,050 --> 00:51:03,110
Even the key chain we kept our keys on was the same

654
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:09,880
Each and every thing we did was exactly the same

655
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,950
The happiness we shared returning to the same home

656
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:17,580
The happiness we shared laughing at the same TV shows

657
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:21,180
This impression isn't even close

658
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:24,650
You made fun of me for how bad it was

659
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:30,930
It was nowhere close., but I wondered if maybe there was the smallest chance it could be

660
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:39,310
Even though you were crying., I was just laughing., blissfully unaware

661
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:53,210
It was nowhere close., and no matter how much you cry now., it's still an awful impression

662
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:07,190
It really wasn't even remotely close., and no matter how much you cry now., it's still an awful impression

663
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:38,640
The unhapiness we shared getting mad when our opinions differed

664
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,390
The happiness we shared accepting our feelings were different

665
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:45,910
You weren't even looking at me for who I was at all

666
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:49,430
You were being torn apart and things weren't all right

667
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:55,820
But if I pretended not to see., I wondered if maybe there was the smallest chance they could be

668
00:52:55,820 --> 00:53:03,470
But you laughed., and so I just laughed., blissfully unaware

669
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:06,870
The fond memories of those days we spent

670
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:10,590
That happiness we found in every day

671
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:15,980
I have a feeling that somewhere it all exists even now., I'm sure of it

672
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,500
You've gotta find it

673
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:32,180
It was nowhere close., and no matter how much you cry now., it's still an awful impression

674
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:46,020
It really wasn't even remotely close., and no matter how much you cry now., it's still an awful impression
