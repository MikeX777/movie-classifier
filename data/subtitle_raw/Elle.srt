1
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,425
And some hamachi. Two pieces.

2
00:03:34,216 --> 00:03:36,133
What is a "holiday roll"?

3
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:39,758
Okay.

4
00:03:40,508 --> 00:03:41,591
Thank you.

5
00:03:45,716 --> 00:03:47,633
I'm late, I know. Sorry.

6
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:50,661
They kept me at work an extra hour.

7
00:03:50,758 --> 00:03:51,758
Are you okay?

8
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:52,925
Okay.

9
00:03:53,258 --> 00:03:54,300
What's that?

10
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:55,841
I fell off my bike.

11
00:03:56,425 --> 00:03:57,841
- That thing?
- Yeah.

12
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:00,401
Looks like you never rode it.

13
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:01,425
And you see why?

14
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:06,842
You've carefully avoided
saying what this job is.

15
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,883
I told you, it's entry level.

16
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,008
But there's a fast track to promotion.

17
00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:14,175
Kind of manager.

18
00:04:14,342 --> 00:04:15,800
Kind of McDonald's?

19
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:17,466
Yeah.

20
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:20,925
I brought you a present.

21
00:04:22,216 --> 00:04:23,550
It's from Josie, really.

22
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:25,675
It was her idea.

23
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:28,550
You look very handsome.

24
00:04:30,632 --> 00:04:33,591
We'll go back and take another
photo after the birth.

25
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:35,341
Like a before and after.

26
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,966
Josie's full of ideas for decorating.

27
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,257
She never had her own place till now.

28
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:44,216
How much do you need for the apartment?

29
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:47,632
I didn't ask for money.

30
00:04:47,716 --> 00:04:49,716
No, it was me, hearing voices.

31
00:04:50,175 --> 00:04:53,382
I planned to ask you to provide
collateral, not money.

32
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,216
And Josie's boyfriends?

33
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,050
Any of them moving in, too?

34
00:05:00,132 --> 00:05:01,675
No, why...

35
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:04,466
Shit! It was just cleaned.

36
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:12,411
That girl is clearly dysfunctional.

37
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:14,007
You know nothing about her.

38
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:18,425
Except she was raised in a
commune by unwashed idiots.

39
00:05:18,507 --> 00:05:19,800
An arts collective.

40
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:22,382
Why you? What's she after?

41
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:25,007
What could she be after? I have no money.

42
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,007
I have.

43
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:28,675
What's with you today?

44
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:39,925
I'll give you 3 months' rent.
But I look at the place first.

45
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:41,925
I didn't want to pressure you.

46
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:44,257
You won. Quit while you're ahead.

47
00:05:54,716 --> 00:05:56,341
- Bye.
- Bye.

48
00:06:58,882 --> 00:07:01,591
Change all the locks, upstairs and down.

49
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,300
Okay.

50
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,925
I left the key in the mailbox.

51
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:07,675
Thanks a lot.

52
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:09,841
You've seen Vincent's apartment?

53
00:07:09,925 --> 00:07:12,733
6 months ago, he was dealing
weed and getting into fights.

54
00:07:12,757 --> 00:07:14,313
You see him as a family man?

55
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:16,966
That bitch Josie is a real menace.

56
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:19,800
He just doesn't see it.

57
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:53,050
Kwan, we agreed

58
00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:55,757
the orgasmic convulsions are way too timid.

59
00:07:55,925 --> 00:07:57,632
As if they're scared of sex.

60
00:07:57,716 --> 00:07:59,300
I upped it 5 times.

61
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:00,966
You can't tell. Push it.

62
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,841
Can we discuss the real issues?

63
00:08:04,257 --> 00:08:06,757
We get one shot at Activision,

64
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:08,882
but our controller is so crappy

65
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:11,841
the demo is almost unplayable.

66
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,091
What's the point coming up with hyper
realistic environments for Stix

67
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:20,026
if the player throws the
controller through the screen!

68
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,425
Kurt, you're off track,
focusing on known glitches.

69
00:08:23,507 --> 00:08:24,507
No.

70
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:27,035
The real problem is right there.

71
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:32,758
The real problem is, your background
in publishing and literature

72
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:36,966
is completely inappropriate
for evaluating playability.

73
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:46,341
Okay, maybe Anna and I should've
founded a different sort of company.

74
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,133
Maybe Kronos was only a hit

75
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:51,258
thanks to your genius ideas.

76
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:55,216
Maybe we're just two bitches who got lucky.

77
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:56,383
But the fact is,

78
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:59,008
the boss here is me.

79
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:01,633
And we're 6 months behind.

80
00:09:07,383 --> 00:09:09,633
Our goal is simple, as you all know.

81
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,299
When the player guts an orc,

82
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:13,883
he needs to feel the blood on his hands.

83
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:15,674
Thick, warm blood.

84
00:09:15,883 --> 00:09:17,174
If at all possible.

85
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:18,466
Let's go.

86
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:20,758
I love you.

87
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:28,841
Does Kurt hate me or is it just me?

88
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:30,924
No, he hates you.

89
00:09:31,383 --> 00:09:33,341
They all hate you, except Kevin.

90
00:09:33,424 --> 00:09:36,424
He really loves you. even if
he tries to laugh it off.

91
00:09:38,674 --> 00:09:40,466
And you knew it, right?

92
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:51,216
Press here.

93
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,383
She knows I want a full STD panel?

94
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:54,633
Yes, of course.

95
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:57,966
If you're worried about a recent exposure,

96
00:09:58,049 --> 00:09:59,674
I can prescribe a PEP.

97
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:03,008
No, I looked online. Too many side effects.

98
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,674
I can't miss any work.

99
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:08,466
I guess we roll the dice.

100
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:32,174
Hello?

101
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,383
My evening just cleared up.

102
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:37,591
- I can't.
- Make an effort.

103
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:40,049
I can't. I have...

104
00:10:41,258 --> 00:10:43,883
I have my period. I'm not well.

105
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:46,174
I'll wear a condom.

106
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:49,109
I appreciate your sense of sacrifice.

107
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:51,341
A little blood doesn't turn me off.

108
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:52,633
No, I can't.

109
00:10:52,924 --> 00:10:53,924
See you.

110
00:11:01,258 --> 00:11:04,341
Scum!

111
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:40,008
You and your father.

112
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:41,939
I love everything you do to me.

113
00:11:42,174 --> 00:11:45,133
Let's do it again.

114
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:50,758
Next time, ring the bell.

115
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:54,549
If you want to avoid being
treated to upsetting sights,

116
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:57,841
Then you won't be treated
to gruesome sights.

117
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:00,049
I'd better put some pants on.

118
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:03,924
How much do you pay them?

119
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:06,424
- It's pitiful!
- Save your pity.

120
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:07,924
I'm not ashamed.

121
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:10,049
It's my life. My sex life.

122
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,734
You're a little bitch, Michèle.

123
00:12:11,758 --> 00:12:14,466
I'm just saying, with your finances.
Be careful.

124
00:12:14,591 --> 00:12:16,258
Did you eat? I made spaghetti.

125
00:12:16,341 --> 00:12:17,716
I'll take a coffee.

126
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,911
- Not taking your coat off?
- I'm cold.

127
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:24,966
You had more work done?

128
00:12:25,174 --> 00:12:27,063
Will you stop going on about that?

129
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:29,591
I'm sorry.

130
00:12:29,674 --> 00:12:31,758
Just a little Botox.

131
00:12:32,008 --> 00:12:33,383
It's your business.

132
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:37,591
Very good.

133
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,966
You seem surprised.

134
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,466
Better like this?

135
00:12:41,258 --> 00:12:43,799
Michèle, some other time,
I have to take off.

136
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:45,383
No. not yet.

137
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:53,299
My mother told you she's HIV-positive?

138
00:12:53,466 --> 00:12:55,883
I warned Ralf you'd try that one.

139
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:57,674
Nice meeting you.

140
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:05,133
One question. Think before you answer.

141
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:07,591
What would you say if I remarried?

142
00:13:07,674 --> 00:13:09,299
It's simple, I'd kill you.

143
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:10,841
No need to think.

144
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:14,174
You always wanted a
sanitized version of life.

145
00:13:14,258 --> 00:13:15,841
You asked, I answered.

146
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:17,216
I'd kill you.

147
00:13:17,633 --> 00:13:20,258
You're so selfish, it's frightening.

148
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,758
I know.

149
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:26,549
By the way, here's your check.

150
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,133
You never give anything truly of yourself.

151
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:35,299
- Your father, it's such an ordeal?
- Don't.

152
00:13:35,383 --> 00:13:37,424
- He's old.
- Still breathing.

153
00:13:37,508 --> 00:13:39,008
Some bonds never break.

154
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:41,317
I walk in and it's one
horror after another.

155
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:42,966
He has a parole hearing.

156
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:45,299
That's enough. Okay?

157
00:13:49,424 --> 00:13:51,716
Your stud forgot his hernia belt.

158
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:01,091
- You need a hand?
- No, I've got it.

159
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:04,883
Is it big enough?

160
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:08,091
Any taller and the star
will scrape the ceiling.

161
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:12,216
Michèle!

162
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:13,591
Evening.

163
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:16,216
I'm so glad I caught you. Here...

164
00:14:16,591 --> 00:14:18,091
I'm handing these out.

165
00:14:18,216 --> 00:14:21,091
It's about the Board's
trash separation policy.

166
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:22,008
Thank you.

167
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:25,049
The fines for non-compliance
are exorbitant.

168
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:27,341
We're meeting Wednesday to oppose it.

169
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:29,508
You're on the Board, aren't you?

170
00:14:29,591 --> 00:14:31,799
- Yes.
- I've tried to point out

171
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:33,966
that minor conflict of interest.

172
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:36,299
It's an interesting position.

173
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:38,258
Yes, that's right. Exactly.

174
00:14:38,924 --> 00:14:40,549
I hope you can make it.

175
00:14:40,674 --> 00:14:41,758
Perhaps.

176
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,258
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

177
00:14:45,049 --> 00:14:46,883
I'll just deliver these.

178
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,133
Be right back!

179
00:15:04,466 --> 00:15:06,067
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

180
00:15:06,091 --> 00:15:09,424
Last one. Your new keys are on the table.

181
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:10,674
Thank you.

182
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:14,591
Did you notice the back door jams?

183
00:15:15,674 --> 00:15:18,133
I only do locks.

184
00:15:19,008 --> 00:15:21,133
How come?

185
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:22,216
Okay.

186
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:52,049
How'd you get out there?

187
00:15:54,758 --> 00:15:55,883
Come on in.

188
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:55,619
You didn't have to claw his eyes
out but scratch him at least.

189
00:16:55,758 --> 00:16:57,508
I'm just saying.

190
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,292
I found you very narrow,
for a woman of your age.

191
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,750
That one's 25.

192
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,916
That's the Safety Angel.

193
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,083
- The most powerful?
- Serious stuff.

194
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:36,750
0.2 oz of pepper spray at 110 mph.

195
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,708
Gives you quite an advantage.

196
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,333
I'll take it.

197
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:51,916
And this.

198
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:32,750
Hey, you!

199
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,226
You told Vincent you'd pay his rent?

200
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,500
No, I said I'd help out for a while.

201
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:40,708
Mr. Casamayou, your table's ready.

202
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,666
Don't expect me to pitch in.
I'm stone broke.

203
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,584
I'm the one who made the promise.

204
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,125
Why?

205
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,666
Struggling to get by builds character.

206
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,351
Trouble is, he's dating a psycho.

207
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,791
Thank you very much.

208
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:57,125
The wacko won't tolerate struggling.

209
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:58,583
Psycho's the word.

210
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:01,333
Often though, that kind
of girl's good in bed.

211
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,000
What does that even mean, " good in bed"?

212
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,083
- I never knew. -You read my proposal?

213
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,375
Richard, would you say I'm
tight for a woman my age?

214
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:16,916
Hi there!

215
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,125
- Hi.
- Thanks.

216
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,708
What's up, loser?

217
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,958
How are you, pumpkin?

218
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:27,041
Just in time to hear Michèle avoid
giving her thoughts on my game idea.

219
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,601
No! It was very interesting.

220
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,125
You bet it's interesting.

221
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:32,041
Tell all.

222
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,976
- Bubbly, 4 glasses.
- No. a bottle!

223
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,666
It's set in a time when dogs
have been wiped out by a virus.

224
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,625
So people have robotic canines as pets.

225
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,569
The player's the Spartacus
of the robot-dog world.

226
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,541
Original.

227
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,541
Interesting.

228
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,042
I have something to tell you all.

229
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:01,833
I was looking for a way
of simply and naturally

230
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,416
tossing this out. but I can't find one.

231
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,916
So...

232
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,791
Here goes. I was assaulted

233
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,333
at home.

234
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,041
I guess I was raped.

235
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,375
Raped?

236
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,458
- Oh my god.
- For real?

237
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
When?

238
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,125
Thursday, at 3pm.

239
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:27,666
And you never said?

240
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,250
I don't know what to say. What can I say?

241
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,083
Oh my god!

242
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,708
- I feel stupid for bringing it up.
- Are you insane?

243
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,500
A Piper-Heidsieck.

244
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,041
Very good.

245
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,625
Wait a few minutes before popping it.

246
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,500
Are you alright?

247
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,430
You have to see a doctor.

248
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,791
Done that.

249
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,666
What did the cops say?

250
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,208
You didn't report it?

251
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:01,541
Michèle, you have to report it immediately.

252
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,625
What for?

253
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:04,083
What for!

254
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,014
It's over. It doesn't need
talking about anymore.

255
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:08,958
It's not worth a debate.

256
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,208
How about we order?

257
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,434
You avoid the police because...

258
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,750
Of course I avoid the police "because!"

259
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:24,416
I won't deal with the police ever again.

260
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,750
- See you!
- See you!

261
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:30,250
- I'll get you a gun. -A gun!
You're out of your mind.

262
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,184
Richard. I should tell you...

263
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,333
Your proposal, our investors
aren't interested.

264
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,139
I don't want to discuss it now.

265
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:39,333
But I'd like your opinion on it.

266
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,375
It's got nothing to do with
the quality of your work.

267
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:46,750
It's a business that's tied
into a particular demographic.

268
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:49,125
A demographic oblivious to quality?

269
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,500
Exactly.

270
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,208
Come on, I can take it!

271
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,291
Be honest. What did you think of it?

272
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:57,625
Richard, go back to your novel.
You're a writer.

273
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,458
Sure. A penniless writer.

274
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,500
Somebody trashed your fender.

275
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:06,708
Somebody?

276
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,416
See you.

277
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,375
Shit!

278
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,625
Here you go.

279
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,500
I'll be right there, I...

280
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,750
I'll just grab my jacket.

281
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:43,541
You got my sundae?

282
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,583
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

283
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,000
Here, for you.

284
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,083
- For me?
- Yes, made it myself.

285
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:03,916
That's so sweet.

286
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:14,958
- Delicious.
- Not bad, right?

287
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:20,000
Mrs. Leblanc? Hello.

288
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:20,541
Hello

289
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:22,791
I'm Philippe, from the agency.

290
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,166
Vincent, good timing, I need you here.

291
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,583
Hey, Michèle.

292
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:28,903
- What can I do? -Stand against the wall.

293
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:30,500
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

294
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:32,375
With your arms...

295
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:36,625
The bookcase is 5 feet wide.
I want to visualize it.

296
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,166
Like this, okay?

297
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,250
Vincent...

298
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:42,750
Don't act the bookcase. Be the bookcase.

299
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,208
Okay, hold this.

300
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,708
Vincent is quite the actor.

301
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,666
Are you hurt?

302
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,166
- No.
- No, it's fine.

303
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,666
Age 12, he was young Achilles in Kronos.

304
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,541
A video game I produced.

305
00:23:58,625 --> 00:23:59,916
Yeah?

306
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,684
I bet you were the cutest knight in armor.

307
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:04,250
Not too shabby.

308
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:15,291
Nice, huh?

309
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,750
A little too nice, don't you think?

310
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,791
There's room for a 50-inch here.

311
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,208
Did you ask her?

312
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,666
You mentioned a microwave,

313
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:29,750
but we thought a TV makes a
better housewarming present.

314
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:32,666
Don't you need an oven more than a TV?

315
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,708
We don't need one. The kitchen
comes fully equipped.

316
00:24:36,583 --> 00:24:38,767
Is this the apartment you told me about?

317
00:24:38,791 --> 00:24:41,458
No, it's a 2-bedroom here.

318
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,833
$250 a month more.

319
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:47,375
The other one was a dump.
Nowhere to put a crib.

320
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:48,750
Totally insane.

321
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:51,416
Dump, I don't think so.

322
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,458
Basic, maybe.

323
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,167
Dump, definitely not.

324
00:24:58,166 --> 00:24:59,750
Basic, sure.

325
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:05,625
You realize having a child
is all about suffering?

326
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:08,250
Vincent's birth was sheer hell.

327
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,666
Torture.

328
00:25:10,083 --> 00:25:11,250
Three hours of agony.

329
00:25:11,291 --> 00:25:13,291
If you don't want to help us, don't.

330
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:14,750
Nobody's forcing you.

331
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:16,916
How'll you get by if I don't?

332
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:19,750
That's our problem.

333
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,750
You can't talk to me like
that and take my money.

334
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:25,041
I don't give a shit about your money.

335
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,625
I never asked for it.

336
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:31,458
You just stand there,
saying nothing, as usual!

337
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:35,541
It's bullshit! When are you
going to get off your ass?

338
00:25:40,166 --> 00:25:41,541
Butt out, you!

339
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,958
You realize that this is impossible?

340
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:45,458
- What?
- She's a lunatic.

341
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:47,750
She's not. she's my girlfriend.

342
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:50,250
You refuse to see I've changed.

343
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:54,250
What do you feel now?

344
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,000
Fear or anger?

345
00:25:56,083 --> 00:25:57,500
Anger.

346
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:01,042
You've missed your wife.
Anna's in Angoulême today.

347
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,083
And you knew it.

348
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:21,541
You know I went through
a traumatic experience

349
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:23,041
recently.

350
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,750
You gave the impression of
soldiering on like nothing happened.

351
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:31,500
If I seem insensitive, I'm sorry.

352
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,166
That's just me, right?

353
00:26:34,416 --> 00:26:36,305
I see you're staying in character.

354
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:40,041
A big part of my character

355
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:54,666
is being unpredictable.

356
00:26:58,416 --> 00:26:59,458
Hold on.

357
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,458
Say, have you experienced
any incidents recently?

358
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:58,291
Incidents?

359
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:00,000
You know what I mean.

360
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:03,458
A man threw pizza at me from his car.
He missed.

361
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:06,750
People were staring at me at the market.

362
00:29:06,958 --> 00:29:08,500
But I always feel that.

363
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:11,291
I wonder if it isn't starting again.

364
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,208
A new cycle.

365
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,750
You don't know?

366
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:18,958
The Accused Will Rise about your
father aired again last Saturday.

367
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:21,750
- Refreshes people's memories.
- I'd no idea.

368
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:23,291
And you?

369
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,625
Anything happened?

370
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:27,208
No, nothing special.

371
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:31,111
It's because of his parole hearing.

372
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,750
A media feeding frenzy.

373
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,945
He's up before the judge next week.

374
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:36,639
You don't miss a beat.

375
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:38,625
Two coffees, please.

376
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,208
Come with me.

377
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:43,250
They'll never let him out. Thank god!

378
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:45,958
The parole hearing is a charade.

379
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:47,708
Like you telling me to come,

380
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:50,180
when you know I'd rather gouge my eyes out.

381
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,017
How long will you hang on to hatred?

382
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:55,375
I'll never see him again,
in this world or any other.

383
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:57,267
- Anyway, there is no other.
- Your coffee.

384
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:59,267
- There isn't much time left.
- Thanks.

385
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:00,416
He's ill.

386
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:02,833
Look...

387
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,666
Look, just for one moment.

388
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,736
You're afraid to look at your own father?

389
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:19,375
Put it away now.

390
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:22,375
You're not like the mob.

391
00:30:22,708 --> 00:30:24,791
People who only know the monster.

392
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,750
You know the man. He's just a man.

393
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:29,750
Who happens to be a monster.

394
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,791
You see a contradiction there?

395
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,583
Drink up. I'm done here.

396
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:38,083
Be careful, won't you?

397
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:41,083
Some people won't just toss crap

398
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:42,583
from their cars.

399
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,375
Marty!

400
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,041
Give me that bird.

401
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,083
Marty!

402
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,958
We don't treat wild birds. It's a sparrow?

403
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,500
Yes.

404
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:06,291
I wouldn't even know how
to intubate your sparrow.

405
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:07,958
If it is a sparrow.

406
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,791
Thanks very much.

407
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:12,916
Goodbye.

408
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,458
You're welcome. Goodbye.

409
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,833
...victims of all ages.

410
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:37,375
Seen today, this quiet street
in the suburbs of Nantes

411
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:41,083
bears no trace of the
atrocities that took place here

412
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:42,583
39 years ago.

413
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,166
Few of today's inhabitants

414
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,973
know the name, Georges Leblanc.

415
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,833
Or if they do,

416
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:52,208
it's a name associated with a horror story

417
00:32:52,291 --> 00:32:54,041
that they can hardly remember.

418
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,208
An urban folktale from another time.

419
00:32:57,583 --> 00:32:59,916
And yet, in 1976,

420
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,125
the eyes of France were
trained on this street.

421
00:33:03,791 --> 00:33:05,583
A nation held its breath.

422
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:07,208
In shock.

423
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:09,236
Time has dulled the terror

424
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:11,375
of that distant day in May.

425
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:14,750
But for some the horror
will never fade away.

426
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:17,416
Nor will the unanswered questions.

427
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:20,500
What drove Georges Leblanc,

428
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:22,083
a practising Catholic,

429
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,916
loving husband and father,

430
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,083
to commit such monstrous
and senseless acts?

431
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:32,250
And what role exactly was played
by his daughter, Michèle?

432
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:35,083
A ten-year-old child at the time.

433
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:41,559
After years of trials and
psychiatric evaluations,

434
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:44,625
over 30 years after Georges
Leblanc's incarceration,

435
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:46,583
sentenced to life,

436
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,625
the questions remain,

437
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,542
as banal yet chilling as ever.

438
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:53,083
First and foremost...

439
00:33:53,333 --> 00:33:54,375
Why?

440
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:55,958
Murderer!

441
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:13,750
I hope that's recyclable.

442
00:34:14,458 --> 00:34:15,916
It's a dead bird.

443
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:48,208
Richard!

444
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:54,500
What were you thinking?

445
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:56,416
I was worried about you.

446
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,625
Jesus!

447
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:59,625
Don't rub your eyes.

448
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:05,559
You say you were raped
and didn't report it,

449
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:06,972
obviously I'm going to...

450
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:10,208
Holy shit, you really did a number on me!

451
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:11,875
I'm sorry.

452
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:14,833
That helps? You know what you're doing?

453
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:17,041
It's on the pepper spray label.

454
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,542
Could be, I'll go blind.

455
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:20,375
Of course, you won't go blind!

456
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:22,541
There we go.

457
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,875
- Glass of wine?
- Yes. please.

458
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,791
I didn't recognize the car. Whose is it?

459
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:32,250
A friend's.

460
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:33,791
A girl friend's?

461
00:36:34,916 --> 00:36:37,041
- Her name's Hélène.
- Hélène.

462
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:41,791
I borrowed hers. Mine's in the shop.

463
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:43,708
Somebody smashed the bumper.

464
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:46,375
It was barely visible.

465
00:36:51,291 --> 00:36:52,916
She's a friend, Michèle.

466
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,708
Why am I even justifying this?

467
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:56,416
You have nothing to justify.

468
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:00,291
- She's a student?
- Grad student.

469
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:02,250
Surprise me.

470
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:05,916
She's not my student. She
organizes a De Beauvoir seminar.

471
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,458
She invited me to speak.

472
00:37:07,666 --> 00:37:08,934
And she's read your book.

473
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:10,041
She's read it.

474
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:12,500
And told me how deeply it touched her,

475
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,458
I melted inside.

476
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:17,041
That's all. You can imagine the rest.

477
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:19,250
I can imagine just fine, actually.

478
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:21,666
Your jealousy is insane.

479
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,708
No, I'm just concerned.

480
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:28,791
I'm concerned because
this is what I feared.

481
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,059
The bimbos with big tits never worried me,

482
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,791
but a woman who's read The
Second Sex will chew you up

483
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:37,666
and spit you out.

484
00:37:37,833 --> 00:37:40,125
The real danger, Michèle, is you.

485
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:46,166
Did you know about her?

486
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,875
Yeah, I met her once.

487
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:49,458
When was that?

488
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:52,958
Last week. We all had dinner at Dad's.

489
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:55,153
Why didn't you mention it?

490
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:56,500
I dunno...

491
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:58,226
Josie, put that down. I'll do it.

492
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,625
When?

493
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,125
Can I have some focus here, please?

494
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:03,291
What?

495
00:38:03,625 --> 00:38:04,916
What's Hélène like?

496
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:08,666
She's cool. A yoga teacher.
Bikram yoga, I think.

497
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,166
Move your feet, will you?

498
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:11,416
Where?

499
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,125
- Why? -I told Eric he could have it.

500
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,833
Eric? Who's this Eric?

501
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:17,166
Marais Yoga Center.

502
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,916
- Can't it wait?
- Move your feet!

503
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
How about you help me unpack?

504
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:25,458
I'll be right there.

505
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:27,583
The fight'll be over in 10 minutes.

506
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:29,500
And soccer next up.

507
00:38:35,574 --> 00:38:37,532
Josie! Where are you going?

508
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:40,617
Vincent, I'll call you back.

509
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:42,032
Yeah. bye.

510
00:38:51,574 --> 00:38:52,699
Seen it?

511
00:38:53,117 --> 00:38:54,992
It was sent to the whole office?

512
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:56,157
Take a look.

513
00:39:10,282 --> 00:39:12,505
This isn't the first thing he's sent me.

514
00:39:12,992 --> 00:39:14,657
First thing who's sent you?

515
00:39:16,907 --> 00:39:18,449
The guy who attacked you?

516
00:39:18,532 --> 00:39:19,907
Of course.

517
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:22,782
You think that's possible? Your attacker?

518
00:39:23,157 --> 00:39:26,199
I mean, the email seems to come from here.

519
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:27,532
Looks like it.

520
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,324
Call the police now.

521
00:39:29,407 --> 00:39:32,117
The police, never again. It's pointless.

522
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:34,407
This is different. You're the victim.

523
00:39:34,492 --> 00:39:36,367
I was the victim then!

524
00:39:37,324 --> 00:39:38,407
Sorry, I...

525
00:39:38,449 --> 00:39:40,258
I don't want the police involved.

526
00:39:40,282 --> 00:39:42,838
I won't let this cretin
stir up all that shit.

527
00:39:42,992 --> 00:39:46,867
I fought too hard to rebuild my
life, so police, journalists...

528
00:39:47,492 --> 00:39:48,782
No way.

529
00:39:49,282 --> 00:39:50,282
God help us.

530
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:51,867
There's a nutjob out there.

531
00:39:51,907 --> 00:39:54,492
Nutjobs, I can handle. My specialty.

532
00:39:55,617 --> 00:39:57,562
When our server was hacked in June,

533
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:05,074
somebody ripped the Cthulhu
template off our mainframe.

534
00:40:05,532 --> 00:40:08,255
Images like these have
floated around since then.

535
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,449
My secret admirer

536
00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:12,532
must be highly tech savvy.

537
00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:16,657
- A former employee maybe?
- Yeah.

538
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:23,782
Last question. You think she's pretty?

539
00:40:26,242 --> 00:40:28,218
Bend forward, from low in your back.

540
00:40:28,242 --> 00:40:31,157
Stretch your spine all
the way to the floor.

541
00:40:31,824 --> 00:40:32,949
Deep breath.

542
00:40:33,032 --> 00:40:36,657
Push the floor with your left
hand until seated again.

543
00:40:36,742 --> 00:40:38,199
Thank you all very much.

544
00:40:38,282 --> 00:40:40,949
Have a good day. Excellent work.

545
00:40:42,867 --> 00:40:43,867
Namaste.

546
00:40:45,367 --> 00:40:46,367
Hélène?

547
00:40:47,157 --> 00:40:50,574
I'm Michèle. Richard's ex.

548
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:54,407
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

549
00:40:54,492 --> 00:40:56,949
Hope you don't mind me barging in.

550
00:40:57,032 --> 00:41:00,032
I wanted to apologize face to face.

551
00:41:00,282 --> 00:41:01,199
For what?

552
00:41:01,282 --> 00:41:03,492
Your car window. I'm sorry.

553
00:41:03,617 --> 00:41:08,032
Please. it's nothing. Anyway,
Richard explained it all.

554
00:41:08,782 --> 00:41:11,032
Really? What was his explanation?

555
00:41:11,117 --> 00:41:13,242
It was an accident.

556
00:41:14,324 --> 00:41:16,992
Yes, that's right. An accident.

557
00:41:17,782 --> 00:41:19,949
And a good chance to meet you.

558
00:41:20,032 --> 00:41:21,199
Yes, great!

559
00:41:21,242 --> 00:41:23,657
It's wonderful finally meeting you.

560
00:41:23,824 --> 00:41:26,936
- I was thinking... -Richard
won't have to introduce us.

561
00:41:26,992 --> 00:41:29,074
We've dodged an awkward situation.

562
00:41:29,867 --> 00:41:32,117
Why would it be awkward?

563
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,407
Well...

564
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,449
Of course, you're right, it's...

565
00:41:36,782 --> 00:41:38,699
I guess we could have...

566
00:41:38,782 --> 00:41:41,574
- I mean... -But it's behind us now.

567
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:42,699
Exactly!

568
00:41:45,407 --> 00:41:48,532
We should get together
some time, all of us.

569
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:51,088
Yes. I'm having a Christmas party.

570
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:53,407
You really must come.

571
00:41:53,742 --> 00:41:55,117
Come along.

572
00:41:55,657 --> 00:41:56,824
If I must.

573
00:41:56,992 --> 00:42:00,242
I'll give Richard the details.
I should get going.

574
00:42:00,867 --> 00:42:02,199
Lovely to meet you.

575
00:42:02,282 --> 00:42:04,324
Yes, lovely to have met you.

576
00:42:04,407 --> 00:42:05,782
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

577
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:18,867
Hello?

578
00:42:22,742 --> 00:42:24,367
Port Royal, right now?

579
00:42:26,117 --> 00:42:27,242
Really?

580
00:42:30,782 --> 00:42:33,175
She was losing blood.
They did an ultrasound.

581
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:35,657
- She has a... -A placental abruption.

582
00:42:35,742 --> 00:42:38,218
They say it's okay but
they're inducing labor.

583
00:42:38,242 --> 00:42:39,992
- Oh -Omar, a buddy of mine.

584
00:42:40,074 --> 00:42:41,282
- Hello.
- Dad!

585
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:44,032
- What's the news?
- Nothing yet.

586
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:47,449
- Hi.
- Hi.

587
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:48,867
I'm right here.

588
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:51,867
- I'm scared. -It's gonna be okay.

589
00:42:53,367 --> 00:42:55,074
It hurts!

590
00:42:55,992 --> 00:42:57,657
I'll go get a coffee.

591
00:42:57,699 --> 00:42:59,157
Deep breaths.

592
00:42:59,242 --> 00:43:01,617
Fuck, it hurts!

593
00:43:02,242 --> 00:43:04,867
So suddenly you're throwing
a Christmas party?

594
00:43:05,117 --> 00:43:08,699
I thought it'd be good to get
to know each other better.

595
00:43:08,782 --> 00:43:10,171
She's lovely, by the way.

596
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:11,422
Another of your traps?

597
00:43:11,492 --> 00:43:15,657
I have better things to do than
plot diabolical Christmas dinners.

598
00:43:16,782 --> 00:43:19,383
Is there anything she won't eat?
Any allergies?

599
00:43:19,407 --> 00:43:21,782
The cat's shedding like crazy.

600
00:43:23,492 --> 00:43:25,425
I made no fuss about your violinist.

601
00:43:25,449 --> 00:43:26,782
That was different!

602
00:43:26,867 --> 00:43:30,117
He was married with 3 kids.
He checked every box.

603
00:43:30,532 --> 00:43:33,175
She's a young, single woman
of child-bearing age.

604
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:34,468
You've broken all the rules.

605
00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:37,782
First I heard we had an agreement.
It's not my fault if...

606
00:43:38,867 --> 00:43:42,032
It is your fault. We
should still be together.

607
00:43:42,907 --> 00:43:45,117
- It's your fault.
- You left me.

608
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:46,532
You hit me.

609
00:43:49,282 --> 00:43:52,449
If there's one thing in my
life I regret, it's that.

610
00:43:54,032 --> 00:43:55,032
All done!

611
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:56,824
- All done?
- Yes.

612
00:44:14,782 --> 00:44:17,449
We're going to need a DNA test.

613
00:44:28,782 --> 00:44:31,407
- Are they bringing him in?
- Right now.

614
00:44:31,867 --> 00:44:33,657
I'll be a good mother to him.

615
00:44:33,907 --> 00:44:35,699
Silly! You'll be awesome!

616
00:44:53,867 --> 00:44:55,032
Should we go?

617
00:44:56,532 --> 00:44:57,617
No.

618
00:44:57,782 --> 00:44:59,157
It's fine.

619
00:44:59,532 --> 00:45:01,032
Lots of people here.

620
00:45:10,242 --> 00:45:11,742
Hey, everybody!

621
00:45:16,157 --> 00:45:17,949
Who's a proud Daddy!

622
00:45:23,324 --> 00:45:26,407
A little marvel! Isn't he handsome!

623
00:45:26,492 --> 00:45:28,449
Look at that!

624
00:45:31,449 --> 00:45:33,449
This is where I had my son.

625
00:45:34,074 --> 00:45:35,492
In this maternity unit.

626
00:45:35,657 --> 00:45:36,907
That's funny.

627
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,218
Not really. The amazing thing is,

628
00:45:39,242 --> 00:45:40,282
my friend Anna...

629
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:43,367
- You saw her up there, you met her.
- Yes.

630
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,657
She gave birth here that same night.

631
00:45:48,032 --> 00:45:50,032
This is where we met.

632
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:53,838
Her child was still born. She
asked to breastfeed mine.

633
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:55,449
Oh my!

634
00:45:56,407 --> 00:45:58,699
I said to her, fine.

635
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:01,824
Since then, I've often wondered.

636
00:46:02,742 --> 00:46:04,657
They've always been very close.

637
00:46:05,282 --> 00:46:06,742
Anna and my son.

638
00:46:07,657 --> 00:46:10,242
I wonder if there wasn't some kind of

639
00:46:11,492 --> 00:46:13,867
imprinting, like with ducks.

640
00:46:16,492 --> 00:46:18,367
With me. on the other hand...

641
00:46:18,657 --> 00:46:20,992
- You know... -Sorry, they're paging me.

642
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:24,282
Sometimes I look at Vincent,

643
00:46:24,742 --> 00:46:28,074
the big lout with nothing special about him

644
00:46:28,574 --> 00:46:30,199
that came out of my belly,

645
00:46:31,282 --> 00:46:33,338
and I have to admit I don't know him.

646
00:46:53,157 --> 00:46:55,175
- Evening, Michèle.
- Evening, Rebecca.

647
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:57,867
Patrick will walk you inside.
There's a prowler.

648
00:46:57,949 --> 00:47:00,699
- There is? -Patrick fought with him.

649
00:47:00,782 --> 00:47:02,574
- A prowler?
- Yes.

650
00:47:02,617 --> 00:47:05,324
They're sending 3 cars after the creep.

651
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:07,242
You fought with him?

652
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,008
I caught him crouched in the bushes,

653
00:47:09,032 --> 00:47:10,782
watching your house.

654
00:47:10,867 --> 00:47:12,824
When I approached, he took off.

655
00:47:13,867 --> 00:47:15,282
You saw his face?

656
00:47:15,449 --> 00:47:18,242
No, he was wearing a mask, like a ski mask.

657
00:47:18,324 --> 00:47:20,324
Like a stalker on a TV show.

658
00:47:20,824 --> 00:47:21,824
He got away.

659
00:47:21,907 --> 00:47:23,907
Pat, go in with her.

660
00:47:23,992 --> 00:47:25,699
No, don't bother.

661
00:47:28,699 --> 00:47:31,367
- Do it anyway.
- Okay, be right back.

662
00:47:37,492 --> 00:47:39,617
It's really not necessary, honestly.

663
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:42,282
I have pepper spray in the house.

664
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:43,742
Good to know.

665
00:48:01,782 --> 00:48:04,117
Light switch on your left there.

666
00:48:15,907 --> 00:48:17,463
Everything seems to be okay.

667
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:20,367
Thanks, anyway. I appreciate it.

668
00:48:20,574 --> 00:48:22,367
No problem, I didn't do much.

669
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:24,425
I nearly caught him,

670
00:48:24,449 --> 00:48:26,032
but he took off so fast.

671
00:48:27,742 --> 00:48:30,492
In high school, I ran the
1,000 meters in 2'42".

672
00:48:33,074 --> 00:48:35,992
Perhaps his speed shows
how scared he was of you.

673
00:48:38,117 --> 00:48:40,574
Thank you for salvaging my pride.

674
00:48:40,907 --> 00:48:42,074
You're welcome.

675
00:48:49,324 --> 00:48:50,407
Well...

676
00:48:59,532 --> 00:49:01,758
See anything or hear anything, just shout.

677
00:49:01,782 --> 00:49:02,867
Okay.

678
00:49:06,532 --> 00:49:08,032
I'm a grandmother.

679
00:49:09,782 --> 00:49:11,907
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

680
00:49:23,449 --> 00:49:25,407
God knows why I said that.

681
00:49:51,992 --> 00:49:53,324
Morning, Michèle.

682
00:49:56,117 --> 00:49:57,617
I like your sweater.

683
00:49:58,949 --> 00:49:59,949
Do you ski?

684
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:02,699
Sure.

685
00:50:03,617 --> 00:50:04,840
I'll take you anytime.

686
00:50:28,282 --> 00:50:29,367
Kevin?

687
00:50:30,117 --> 00:50:31,867
You shoot, right?

688
00:50:32,782 --> 00:50:34,742
I mean. real shooting.

689
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:36,492
That's right, I do.

690
00:50:37,324 --> 00:50:38,992
You own guns?

691
00:50:40,074 --> 00:50:41,492
A couple.

692
00:50:44,782 --> 00:50:46,324
Could you teach me?

693
00:50:46,992 --> 00:50:48,324
I could show you, sure.

694
00:50:54,617 --> 00:50:56,449
In real life, that'd do the job.

695
00:50:56,782 --> 00:50:59,199
In real life, he'd run faster.

696
00:50:59,699 --> 00:51:00,742
True.

697
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:02,949
Try the .44 now.

698
00:51:10,699 --> 00:51:12,824
Kevin, I also wanted to talk to you

699
00:51:12,907 --> 00:51:16,032
because I've got an unofficial
assignment for you.

700
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:17,949
A black op?

701
00:51:19,282 --> 00:51:22,532
I want to know who created that animation.

702
00:51:23,992 --> 00:51:25,326
You know the one I mean?

703
00:51:27,157 --> 00:51:30,699
Hack into the home computers
of the whole office.

704
00:51:31,324 --> 00:51:33,199
All the guys, at least.

705
00:51:34,617 --> 00:51:38,367
I want to help, but
that's a major violation.

706
00:51:38,449 --> 00:51:41,242
I'm offering $10,000 cash in hand.

707
00:51:42,492 --> 00:51:44,992
Between you and me. Our secret.

708
00:51:47,907 --> 00:51:51,532
When you snoop on people, you
turn up some weird shit.

709
00:51:51,617 --> 00:51:54,324
I know. I won't judge.

710
00:51:56,782 --> 00:51:58,157
Where does this one go?

711
00:51:58,492 --> 00:52:00,117
Put it right there.

712
00:53:57,782 --> 00:53:59,657
I untangled that one. Try it.

713
00:53:59,867 --> 00:54:02,907
- This one? -On the right.
I'll do the other next.

714
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,407
- Hi, Rebecca!
- Hi. Michèle.

715
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,532
Beautiful!

716
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:09,617
- Evening.
- Evening.

717
00:54:10,324 --> 00:54:13,824
The Nativity gets me every time.
Where it all began.

718
00:54:14,782 --> 00:54:17,074
Very true.

719
00:54:19,074 --> 00:54:22,157
I know it's rude to invite you last minute,

720
00:54:22,242 --> 00:54:25,449
but I'm having a Christmas
get-together tomorrow.

721
00:54:25,699 --> 00:54:27,282
Patrick, did you hear that?

722
00:54:27,367 --> 00:54:28,367
Yeah.

723
00:54:30,074 --> 00:54:31,199
With pleasure.

724
00:54:31,282 --> 00:54:32,633
Yes, with pleasure, absolutely.

725
00:54:32,657 --> 00:54:35,657
Well then...

726
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:37,242
See you tomorrow.

727
00:54:37,324 --> 00:54:38,675
- See you then.
- See you then.

728
00:54:38,699 --> 00:54:39,699
Thank you.

729
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,937
In theory, we could put a toothpick

730
00:54:48,992 --> 00:54:50,881
inside one for Richard's ladylove.

731
00:54:51,617 --> 00:54:53,324
Or just poison her.

732
00:54:53,407 --> 00:54:55,968
She has me pegged as a
Medea, She'd see it coming.

733
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:57,367
Consumed by jealousy.

734
00:54:57,782 --> 00:54:59,657
She was a classics major, too?

735
00:55:04,449 --> 00:55:06,617
- Josie.
- Robert.

736
00:55:07,074 --> 00:55:07,992
Merry Christmas!

737
00:55:08,074 --> 00:55:09,407
- Okay, Dad?
- Great.

738
00:55:09,492 --> 00:55:10,532
Hi, kiddo.

739
00:55:10,617 --> 00:55:13,032
Jeez, he stinks. Here!

740
00:55:14,657 --> 00:55:15,992
How you doing?

741
00:55:17,074 --> 00:55:20,449
You trying to deafen us all
with your shit? Careful.

742
00:55:20,532 --> 00:55:21,867
Hello, all!

743
00:55:22,574 --> 00:55:24,407
Merry Christmas!

744
00:55:28,782 --> 00:55:31,824
If I ever show up like that, kill me.

745
00:55:31,949 --> 00:55:33,282
Evening!

746
00:55:35,657 --> 00:55:36,992
- Evening!
- Evening!

747
00:55:37,157 --> 00:55:39,713
Sorry we're late. I was
digging out a great...

748
00:55:39,742 --> 00:55:40,742
Excuse me.

749
00:55:41,282 --> 00:55:42,407
Cabernet.

750
00:55:44,742 --> 00:55:46,492
- Evening!
- Evening!

751
00:55:46,742 --> 00:55:48,199
Scrabble party!

752
00:55:50,032 --> 00:55:51,367
Thank you.

753
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:52,550
- Evening!
- Evening!

754
00:55:52,574 --> 00:55:53,949
Any more alerts?

755
00:55:54,032 --> 00:55:56,199
No, the bogeyman's deserted us.

756
00:55:56,282 --> 00:55:59,242
Anyway, we're safe tonight.

757
00:55:59,324 --> 00:56:01,907
I got my red belt in March.

758
00:56:02,617 --> 00:56:06,157
I did Taekwondo for years
before switching to Shotokan.

759
00:56:06,242 --> 00:56:07,742
I've never done karate.

760
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:09,699
She was making fun of me.

761
00:56:10,449 --> 00:56:11,449
Ok.

762
00:56:15,657 --> 00:56:17,824
You can't avoid me all night.

763
00:56:17,949 --> 00:56:18,949
Want a bet?

764
00:56:26,574 --> 00:56:27,782
I'm glad you made it.

765
00:56:27,867 --> 00:56:29,574
We don't get out much.

766
00:56:29,657 --> 00:56:32,699
Unfortunately for Rebecca,
who's a very social person.

767
00:56:33,407 --> 00:56:34,742
Unlike me.

768
00:56:35,324 --> 00:56:37,949
I'm glad she dragged you over here tonight.

769
00:56:39,949 --> 00:56:41,574
It was no hardship.

770
00:56:42,907 --> 00:56:44,074
Good evening!

771
00:56:44,617 --> 00:56:46,367
So sorry I'm late.

772
00:56:46,449 --> 00:56:48,157
I couldn't get off work.

773
00:56:48,242 --> 00:56:50,407
We just sat down. Hi, Hélène.

774
00:56:50,492 --> 00:56:51,699
- Evening!
- Evening!

775
00:56:51,782 --> 00:56:53,367
Evening, everybody.

776
00:56:53,449 --> 00:56:54,672
Irène, this is Hélène.

777
00:56:54,742 --> 00:56:56,157
- Evening!
- Evening!

778
00:56:56,242 --> 00:56:58,074
- Evening. I'm Ralf.
- Evening.

779
00:56:59,657 --> 00:57:01,407
Well, enjoy your meal!

780
00:57:01,657 --> 00:57:02,657
Thanks.

781
00:57:03,449 --> 00:57:04,907
I'm sorry...

782
00:57:05,117 --> 00:57:08,492
I'd like to say grace, if nobody objects.

783
00:57:10,324 --> 00:57:11,949
Of course not. Please do.

784
00:57:12,074 --> 00:57:13,492
Thank you.

785
00:57:16,407 --> 00:57:19,032
Bless us, Lord, and bless this meal.

786
00:57:19,617 --> 00:57:21,340
And provide bread to the needy.

787
00:57:22,074 --> 00:57:23,074
Amen.

788
00:57:23,157 --> 00:57:25,117
- Amen.
- Amen.

789
00:57:25,407 --> 00:57:26,574
Wine, Michèle?

790
00:57:26,657 --> 00:57:28,117
With pleasure.

791
00:57:28,657 --> 00:57:30,282
So, Patrick, what do you do?

792
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:31,782
I work in banking.

793
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:35,492
I'm a broker. And I plead guilty.

794
00:57:35,992 --> 00:57:37,032
How come?

795
00:57:37,532 --> 00:57:41,492
Just joking. It's not a
popular profession right now.

796
00:57:41,657 --> 00:57:43,032
It never was.

797
00:57:44,367 --> 00:57:46,199
- I guess not.
- Well.

798
00:57:46,699 --> 00:57:47,867
To Christmas!

799
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:49,242
And to us!

800
00:57:49,324 --> 00:57:53,574
Especially the newcomers to our table...

801
00:57:53,782 --> 00:57:54,907
lrène,

802
00:57:55,992 --> 00:57:57,157
Patrick,

803
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:58,742
Rebecca.

804
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:03,449
Ralf.

805
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:05,199
Ralf.

806
00:58:05,657 --> 00:58:06,699
Merry Christmas!

807
00:58:07,032 --> 00:58:08,782
Merry Christmas!

808
00:58:10,699 --> 00:58:13,699
Michèle's worked like a trooper.

809
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:14,782
Absolutely.

810
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:16,907
I love cooking.

811
00:58:17,367 --> 00:58:18,383
When are you going?

812
00:58:18,407 --> 00:58:21,574
I'll try to book the...

813
00:58:23,367 --> 00:58:26,157
But the period we want books up fast.

814
00:58:26,699 --> 00:58:29,867
People don't realize the
art muscle needs training.

815
00:58:29,949 --> 00:58:32,617
Or else culture collapses, goes flabby.

816
00:58:32,699 --> 00:58:35,492
That's what we've got now. Flabby culture.

817
00:58:35,742 --> 00:58:37,324
Is that aimed at me?

818
00:58:37,407 --> 00:58:38,949
Originality or singularity

819
00:58:39,032 --> 00:58:42,157
used to be valued and sought after.

820
00:58:42,367 --> 00:58:45,492
Or even an end in itself.
Now it's a liability.

821
00:58:45,574 --> 00:58:47,157
Richard's a theorist.

822
00:58:47,282 --> 00:58:49,407
I'm not talking about novelty.

823
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:51,867
Coming out of our ass, novelty!

824
00:58:51,949 --> 00:58:53,657
Delightful image at dinner.

825
00:58:53,742 --> 00:58:56,742
Anyway, what's inspiration? 80% hard work.

826
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:59,699
Some people know nothing of hard work.

827
00:58:59,782 --> 00:59:00,968
It's not in their culture.

828
00:59:00,992 --> 00:59:03,074
We know who you mean.

829
00:59:03,992 --> 00:59:05,449
I didn't say a word.

830
00:59:05,574 --> 00:59:07,867
Everybody's different. I love everyone.

831
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:13,407
We're all children of God!

832
00:59:13,492 --> 00:59:17,157
Yeah, Africans eat goat's innards.
They're different.

833
00:59:17,242 --> 00:59:18,157
Exactly.

834
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:20,574
I went on safari in Kenya. It was great.

835
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:22,157
Right, there you go.

836
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:23,742
I think now is a good time.

837
00:59:25,032 --> 00:59:26,755
I have an announcement to make.

838
00:59:28,867 --> 00:59:32,032
Ralf and I are engaged to be married.

839
00:59:42,617 --> 00:59:43,617
Sorry.

840
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,657
How do you manage to be so grotesque?

841
00:59:50,282 --> 00:59:51,617
Don't you realize?

842
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:55,907
I hope everyone likes blueberries.

843
00:59:57,367 --> 01:00:00,242
Josie added a ton to the official recipe.

844
01:00:00,324 --> 01:00:04,449
I was feeling creative,
so I added blueberries.

845
01:00:07,117 --> 01:00:08,574
Looks good to me.

846
01:00:12,574 --> 01:00:15,907
It's almost midnight. Do you
mind if I put on the Mass?

847
01:00:15,992 --> 01:00:17,242
On the contrary.

848
01:00:23,824 --> 01:00:24,949
You're leaving?

849
01:00:25,949 --> 01:00:27,492
It was wonderful. Really.

850
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:30,050
Next time, our turn. You'll come to us.

851
01:00:30,074 --> 01:00:31,949
Let's not rush things.

852
01:00:32,032 --> 01:00:33,032
Leave it to us.

853
01:00:33,074 --> 01:00:36,992
We'll have lunch first, Michèle and I.

854
01:00:37,242 --> 01:00:38,298
Just the two of us.

855
01:00:38,657 --> 01:00:40,492
One step at a time.

856
01:00:40,617 --> 01:00:42,282
I agree, excellent idea.

857
01:00:42,617 --> 01:00:43,407
Goodnight.

858
01:00:43,492 --> 01:00:44,492
Great.

859
01:00:45,242 --> 01:00:46,574
- See you!
- See you!

860
01:00:48,782 --> 01:00:50,282
See you, 'night!

861
01:00:53,117 --> 01:00:55,574
Flirting with the banker, was that a test?

862
01:00:55,699 --> 01:00:59,074
You're making a scene in my home?
It's come to that?

863
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,949
- We'll talk later.
- Make yourself useful.

864
01:01:17,117 --> 01:01:18,199
Disaster!

865
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:20,782
- That's two double words.
- One double word.

866
01:01:20,867 --> 01:01:22,449
I can top that.

867
01:01:22,532 --> 01:01:24,074
Journey!

868
01:01:24,574 --> 01:01:26,449
- 64.
- Hold on, I've got it.

869
01:01:26,532 --> 01:01:27,699
No, that's 70.

870
01:01:27,742 --> 01:01:29,407
70, you see.

871
01:01:29,492 --> 01:01:30,699
My bad.

872
01:01:30,949 --> 01:01:32,699
- Ladies...
- No, thanks.

873
01:01:32,742 --> 01:01:34,407
- Sure?
- Really.

874
01:01:39,324 --> 01:01:41,407
Curse him! Damn him!

875
01:01:41,492 --> 01:01:44,949
Close the book, ring the
bell, blow out the candle.

876
01:01:46,117 --> 01:01:47,157
What's that?

877
01:01:47,824 --> 01:01:48,968
Call yourself a Catholic?

878
01:01:48,992 --> 01:01:51,242
You don't know the excommunication rite?

879
01:01:52,282 --> 01:01:53,282
And you do?

880
01:01:54,782 --> 01:01:56,492
I've heard about it.

881
01:01:57,699 --> 01:02:00,088
My father made the sign of the cross on me,

882
01:02:00,449 --> 01:02:01,838
before I left for school.

883
01:02:01,867 --> 01:02:03,907
He did it to all the local kids

884
01:02:04,367 --> 01:02:06,742
until some parents asked him to stop.

885
01:02:06,824 --> 01:02:08,157
Sounds reasonable.

886
01:02:08,867 --> 01:02:11,242
Apparently, my father was offended.

887
01:02:11,949 --> 01:02:13,672
That night. he made the rounds.

888
01:02:14,867 --> 01:02:16,492
Knocked on every door,

889
01:02:16,907 --> 01:02:19,032
went into every house on the street

890
01:02:19,242 --> 01:02:20,758
with a shotgun, a butcher's mallet

891
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:22,657
and a pair of kitchen knives.

892
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:25,617
Yes, I heard about that.

893
01:02:25,907 --> 01:02:30,824
You heard about the 27 human
victims, not about the animals.

894
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:32,992
They never get a mention.

895
01:02:33,742 --> 01:02:34,782
6 dogs,

896
01:02:35,824 --> 01:02:37,407
a couple of cats, too.

897
01:02:38,492 --> 01:02:40,949
For whatever reason, he spared a hamster.

898
01:02:41,617 --> 01:02:43,117
You couldn't make it up.

899
01:02:48,992 --> 01:02:52,032
I was doing my homework
when he arrived home

900
01:02:52,199 --> 01:02:53,742
with blood all over him.

901
01:02:54,657 --> 01:02:56,199
My mother was at work.

902
01:02:56,324 --> 01:02:58,574
She was a nurse back then.

903
01:02:58,867 --> 01:03:01,907
Can you imagine my mother. a nurse?

904
01:03:02,242 --> 01:03:03,782
Funny, isn't it?

905
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:05,574
We don't have to go over it.

906
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:08,867
I don't mind. It does me good to talk.

907
01:03:10,742 --> 01:03:13,131
He decided to burn everything in the house.

908
01:03:14,074 --> 01:03:15,492
I helped feed the fire.

909
01:03:15,574 --> 01:03:18,199
We gutted the place. Curtains, carpets...

910
01:03:18,282 --> 01:03:19,657
Tables, chairs...

911
01:03:19,949 --> 01:03:20,992
All in the fire.

912
01:03:21,617 --> 01:03:24,824
It was exciting. You get caught up in it.

913
01:03:26,782 --> 01:03:30,005
We were about to burn our clothes
when the police arrived.

914
01:03:30,199 --> 01:03:31,657
Someone snapped a photo.

915
01:03:33,367 --> 01:03:36,617
Bizarrely, it's that photo
that stuck in people's minds.

916
01:03:37,324 --> 01:03:39,992
Me, half-naked, smeared with ash.

917
01:03:41,492 --> 01:03:43,770
The photo of a little girl as psychopath,

918
01:03:44,032 --> 01:03:45,407
next to her father,

919
01:03:45,907 --> 01:03:47,032
the psychopath.

920
01:03:50,742 --> 01:03:53,199
My empty stare in the photo is terrifying.

921
01:04:00,367 --> 01:04:01,824
Not bad, huh?

922
01:04:03,574 --> 01:04:04,574
Cognac?

923
01:04:04,657 --> 01:04:07,117
- Love one.
- Same glass okay?

924
01:04:09,742 --> 01:04:10,824
Cognac anyone?

925
01:04:10,907 --> 01:04:12,532
- Me, please.
- Whiskey.

926
01:04:12,617 --> 01:04:14,449
- Champagne, please.
- I'm out.

927
01:04:14,532 --> 01:04:16,992
So, one whiskey and one cognac.

928
01:04:17,492 --> 01:04:18,532
Are you aware

929
01:04:18,949 --> 01:04:21,199
how mean you were to me at dinner?

930
01:04:21,282 --> 01:04:22,492
Yes, I am.

931
01:04:22,574 --> 01:04:23,742
You're cruel

932
01:04:23,907 --> 01:04:26,407
when you find anything
or anyone unpleasant.

933
01:04:26,824 --> 01:04:28,380
I'm on the list, apparently.

934
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:31,532
Neither of us is drunk enough
for this conversation.

935
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:32,867
Okay?

936
01:04:44,824 --> 01:04:46,282
- Irène!
- Lrène!

937
01:04:46,367 --> 01:04:47,492
What's happened?

938
01:04:47,574 --> 01:04:48,907
Can you hear me?

939
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:50,657
I don't believe it!

940
01:04:51,032 --> 01:04:52,367
You better believe it!

941
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:12,782
What?

942
01:05:14,949 --> 01:05:16,199
Go see...

943
01:05:16,824 --> 01:05:18,074
your father.

944
01:05:26,824 --> 01:05:28,449
She's had a major stroke.

945
01:05:29,074 --> 01:05:33,407
We alleviated the pressure on her
brain but she remains unresponsive.

946
01:05:34,492 --> 01:05:36,242
Unresponsive. meaning?

947
01:05:37,117 --> 01:05:38,532
She is comatose.

948
01:05:39,742 --> 01:05:40,867
How long for?

949
01:05:41,782 --> 01:05:44,117
Sorry, there's no telling.

950
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:46,867
- I mean, she's stable...
- This is real?

951
01:05:48,117 --> 01:05:49,117
Excuse me?

952
01:05:49,282 --> 01:05:50,532
No. I mean...

953
01:05:51,532 --> 01:05:55,699
There's no way she's faking
it or playing it up?

954
01:05:56,282 --> 01:05:59,074
You're medically certain this is for real?

955
01:06:01,907 --> 01:06:04,742
I'm sorry, but yes it's for real.

956
01:06:04,824 --> 01:06:09,617
In fact, there's a strong probability
your mother will not wake up.

957
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:13,949
But as I say, she's stable right now.

958
01:06:14,699 --> 01:06:16,907
I suggest you get some rest.

959
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:19,532
There's nothing you can do here now.

960
01:06:20,367 --> 01:06:23,117
We'll call you if there's any news.

961
01:06:29,407 --> 01:06:31,074
Goodbye and thank you.

962
01:06:31,157 --> 01:06:32,532
Be strong.

963
01:06:44,657 --> 01:06:45,742
Well?

964
01:06:46,824 --> 01:06:47,949
It's not good.

965
01:06:48,367 --> 01:06:50,534
Do you mind sleeping in the guest room?

966
01:06:51,282 --> 01:06:52,282
No.

967
01:06:52,532 --> 01:06:53,992
You're sleeping with me.

968
01:07:00,574 --> 01:07:02,532
Did you see Richard with Hélène?

969
01:07:02,824 --> 01:07:03,824
I did.

970
01:07:03,949 --> 01:07:06,407
Telling the same old stories.

971
01:07:06,492 --> 01:07:08,532
And she seemed amused by them all.

972
01:07:08,867 --> 01:07:11,032
You'll wind up being good friends.

973
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:13,117
No doubt.

974
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:16,032
I'll go over for dinner,
just the three of us.

975
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:19,175
I picture myself at their
door with a box of macaroons.

976
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:21,199
It makes me want to puke!

977
01:07:47,492 --> 01:07:49,282
You remember in Cassis?

978
01:07:50,242 --> 01:07:51,867
We tried.

979
01:07:56,574 --> 01:07:58,963
It was hopeless. we couldn't stop laughing.

980
01:08:25,074 --> 01:08:26,742
What are you doing?

981
01:08:26,824 --> 01:08:29,843
Anna's gone to the office. I
was trying to cheer you up.

982
01:08:29,867 --> 01:08:32,658
Oddly, your stupidity was
what first attracted me.

983
01:08:33,992 --> 01:08:35,658
Sorry if I misjudged.

984
01:08:35,742 --> 01:08:38,020
I can't do this anymore. We have to stop.

985
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:40,533
You were great and everything.

986
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:42,006
We'll stay friends but...

987
01:08:43,033 --> 01:08:44,199
Are you kidding?

988
01:08:44,533 --> 01:08:47,867
This whole ridiculous situation
is unbearable, right?

989
01:08:48,742 --> 01:08:49,742
Don't you think?

990
01:08:49,949 --> 01:08:50,949
No.

991
01:08:58,242 --> 01:08:59,658
Your breasts are bigger.

992
01:08:59,949 --> 01:09:01,324
Not that I'm aware of.

993
01:09:01,408 --> 01:09:02,699
I'm telling you.

994
01:09:06,992 --> 01:09:09,658
Say you don't want me
anymore and we're done.

995
01:09:10,283 --> 01:09:11,658
It's not that simple.

996
01:09:12,992 --> 01:09:14,283
But if you like...

997
01:09:14,908 --> 01:09:17,992
I don't want this anymore,
this situation, the lies.

998
01:09:19,158 --> 01:09:20,908
You dodged my question.

999
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:23,742
Sorry.

1000
01:09:23,867 --> 01:09:25,701
I don't want to fuck you anymore.

1001
01:09:25,824 --> 01:09:27,367
Was that the question?

1002
01:09:33,699 --> 01:09:34,992
I won't see him.

1003
01:09:35,283 --> 01:09:36,783
I'm not superstitious.

1004
01:09:36,867 --> 01:09:39,574
I couldn't care less about
death-bed requests.

1005
01:09:39,949 --> 01:09:43,949
If you hope to keep manipulating
me with this abject stunt...

1006
01:09:45,242 --> 01:09:48,158
Ever since you gave up on basic morality,

1007
01:09:48,242 --> 01:09:51,117
acting out like a spoiled teenager,

1008
01:09:51,242 --> 01:09:53,408
you never gave a shit what I thought.

1009
01:09:53,699 --> 01:09:55,158
How much it hurt me.

1010
01:09:57,449 --> 01:09:59,617
This aneurysm thing is just treachery.

1011
01:10:00,449 --> 01:10:01,699
Disgusting.

1012
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:06,949
Like this salad, with its shitty olives.

1013
01:10:11,324 --> 01:10:14,117
You can't stay mad at me till the end.

1014
01:10:28,742 --> 01:10:31,492
Sure, the news channel works fine.

1015
01:10:31,617 --> 01:10:33,324
She's in v-tach.

1016
01:10:33,408 --> 01:10:34,908
What's going on?

1017
01:10:37,158 --> 01:10:38,992
What's that beep?

1018
01:10:39,074 --> 01:10:39,742
Ma'am. please.

1019
01:10:39,824 --> 01:10:41,283
Cardiac arrest!

1020
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:47,117
20 mg of GTN.

1021
01:10:47,283 --> 01:10:49,242
No change. Up it to 40!

1022
01:10:50,324 --> 01:10:51,783
Still no change.

1023
01:10:52,492 --> 01:10:53,699
We're losing her.

1024
01:11:44,824 --> 01:11:46,199
What are you doing?

1025
01:13:00,074 --> 01:13:02,783
I'm looking for a spot
with some significance.

1026
01:13:04,367 --> 01:13:06,783
It's not like there'll be a sign that says,

1027
01:13:07,033 --> 01:13:08,699
"Dispose of mother here."

1028
01:13:08,783 --> 01:13:09,574
His pacifier.

1029
01:13:09,658 --> 01:13:13,117
We had a picnic there
once, that hollow there.

1030
01:13:14,449 --> 01:13:16,408
I remember only too well.

1031
01:13:17,742 --> 01:13:20,283
Her chicken salad gave me horrific gas.

1032
01:13:20,367 --> 01:13:21,492
You forgot it?

1033
01:13:23,242 --> 01:13:25,742
How can you be such an idiot?

1034
01:13:26,199 --> 01:13:28,033
Three times I reminded you.

1035
01:13:28,242 --> 01:13:30,992
At home and in the car. You enjoy this?

1036
01:13:31,242 --> 01:13:32,949
See how she talks to him?

1037
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:35,449
Give up the Xbox, moron!

1038
01:13:35,492 --> 01:13:36,408
Stop it.

1039
01:13:36,492 --> 01:13:38,908
Stop it? Stop what?

1040
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:40,783
I'm embarrassing you?

1041
01:13:41,574 --> 01:13:43,367
All you deserve, asshole!

1042
01:13:49,408 --> 01:13:50,617
Baby blues.

1043
01:13:52,033 --> 01:13:55,158
I hope my boy doesn't
inherit her temperament.

1044
01:13:55,617 --> 01:13:56,617
Vincent,

1045
01:13:56,699 --> 01:14:00,199
he's cute but he's not your son.
You know that, right?

1046
01:14:00,658 --> 01:14:01,658
Found it.

1047
01:14:02,783 --> 01:14:03,908
Josie!

1048
01:14:04,408 --> 01:14:05,699
Are you listening?

1049
01:14:05,949 --> 01:14:06,824
What's up?

1050
01:14:06,908 --> 01:14:08,199
He's not your son.

1051
01:14:09,283 --> 01:14:10,949
Look at his skin.

1052
01:14:11,783 --> 01:14:14,283
It's two tones darker
than yours or Josie's.

1053
01:14:15,158 --> 01:14:16,824
Don't you see?

1054
01:14:17,324 --> 01:14:20,449
- Whose is he, if he's not mine?
- He's his father's!

1055
01:14:20,949 --> 01:14:22,324
His father's not you.

1056
01:14:22,492 --> 01:14:24,659
Sorry, but you're being made a fool of.

1057
01:14:26,742 --> 01:14:28,742
Don't lay a finger on me.

1058
01:14:31,117 --> 01:14:32,117
Cunt!

1059
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:33,492
What? Say that again.

1060
01:14:33,867 --> 01:14:34,283
Cunt!

1061
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:36,199
- What?
- Cunt!

1062
01:14:37,658 --> 01:14:38,824
Vincent.

1063
01:14:42,492 --> 01:14:43,533
Stop!

1064
01:14:43,617 --> 01:14:45,367
I know why you're angry.

1065
01:14:45,574 --> 01:14:47,033
Leave me alone.

1066
01:14:48,992 --> 01:14:50,449
So what now?

1067
01:14:54,908 --> 01:14:56,949
Okay, this'll have to do.

1068
01:14:59,242 --> 01:15:01,158
The wind's picking up.

1069
01:15:26,367 --> 01:15:28,384
Sorry to bother you. I
saw your shutters open.

1070
01:15:28,408 --> 01:15:29,867
Come in.

1071
01:15:30,949 --> 01:15:33,242
Sorry if I'm disturbing you...

1072
01:15:33,324 --> 01:15:34,533
You're not.

1073
01:15:34,617 --> 01:15:37,158
With your shutters open
and a storm brewing,

1074
01:15:37,242 --> 01:15:39,117
your windows'll shatter.

1075
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:40,617
That would be bad timing.

1076
01:15:40,699 --> 01:15:42,699
The wind can do serious damage.

1077
01:15:42,783 --> 01:15:43,783
I know.

1078
01:15:43,867 --> 01:15:46,423
You weren't here in '99.
The end of the world.

1079
01:15:46,449 --> 01:15:49,074
I believe it. You need a hand?

1080
01:15:49,699 --> 01:15:51,283
Perhaps, yes. Thanks.

1081
01:15:51,908 --> 01:15:54,158
I never counted. but there must be

1082
01:15:54,242 --> 01:15:56,617
something like 20 windows in this house.

1083
01:15:56,699 --> 01:15:59,033
It's a westerly, so let's start there.

1084
01:15:59,117 --> 01:16:00,367
In the kitchen.

1085
01:16:29,658 --> 01:16:30,742
You're cold?

1086
01:16:31,283 --> 01:16:32,449
A little.

1087
01:16:36,408 --> 01:16:37,949
Next window perhaps?

1088
01:16:40,908 --> 01:16:41,992
Okay.

1089
01:16:47,408 --> 01:16:48,949
I wasn't expecting anyone.

1090
01:16:56,867 --> 01:16:58,574
Looks like a Grumman Wildcat.

1091
01:16:59,283 --> 01:17:00,324
I don't know.

1092
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,992
I'd love to restore one.

1093
01:17:04,324 --> 01:17:05,949
And fly it to New York.

1094
01:17:07,158 --> 01:17:08,324
You're a pilot?

1095
01:17:09,367 --> 01:17:10,367
No.

1096
01:17:10,992 --> 01:17:12,492
You've got to have a dream.

1097
01:17:19,658 --> 01:17:21,158
Let's start with that one.

1098
01:18:03,533 --> 01:18:04,533
Sorry.

1099
01:18:25,617 --> 01:18:28,074
The Summoning scene needs to come later.

1100
01:18:28,158 --> 01:18:30,992
- No. this is... -Kurt,
we have no time to argue.

1101
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:32,992
The player encounters Kira

1102
01:18:33,074 --> 01:18:34,800
in her sweet, schoolteacher persona

1103
01:18:34,824 --> 01:18:36,824
before her Dark Rebirth.

1104
01:18:36,908 --> 01:18:38,964
- Or there's no boner moment!
- Right.

1105
01:18:42,117 --> 01:18:43,199
- Michèle.
- Yes?

1106
01:18:43,283 --> 01:18:44,492
Got a minute?

1107
01:18:45,574 --> 01:18:46,617
Yeah.

1108
01:18:48,783 --> 01:18:51,242
I found something on Kurt's private server.

1109
01:18:51,992 --> 01:18:54,492
It looks like he's into crushing.

1110
01:18:56,492 --> 01:18:57,783
What's "crushing"?

1111
01:18:57,949 --> 01:19:00,242
What it sounds like. Crush-sh.

1112
01:19:00,742 --> 01:19:02,117
Enjoy.

1113
01:19:08,449 --> 01:19:10,908
Twisted, but hardly a smoking gun.

1114
01:19:11,449 --> 01:19:12,867
I guess not.

1115
01:19:21,242 --> 01:19:22,908
Good work. Keep on it.

1116
01:20:01,117 --> 01:20:02,158
Ash girl.

1117
01:20:22,699 --> 01:20:24,492
Deliciously nasty.

1118
01:20:25,449 --> 01:20:26,992
Deliciously nasty.

1119
01:20:37,408 --> 01:20:38,449
You're here?

1120
01:20:44,283 --> 01:20:45,199
You're mad?

1121
01:20:45,283 --> 01:20:46,824
I'm mostly curious.

1122
01:20:48,449 --> 01:20:49,838
I guess I should explain.

1123
01:20:54,574 --> 01:20:56,741
I was never going to show it to anyone.

1124
01:20:57,617 --> 01:20:59,468
Philippe Kwan ripped it off my computer

1125
01:20:59,492 --> 01:21:01,074
and sent it out.

1126
01:21:01,158 --> 01:21:02,658
But you created it?

1127
01:21:04,949 --> 01:21:05,699
Yes.

1128
01:21:05,783 --> 01:21:06,783
Why?

1129
01:21:07,908 --> 01:21:10,449
At first, as a game idea

1130
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:12,033
based on true crime photos.

1131
01:21:12,492 --> 01:21:13,783
Then it got weird.

1132
01:21:14,949 --> 01:21:16,367
Nobody would've seen it

1133
01:21:16,449 --> 01:21:18,116
if that asshole Kwan hadn't...

1134
01:21:18,574 --> 01:21:20,408
If I'm fired, he deserves it too.

1135
01:21:23,324 --> 01:21:24,492
Take out your dick.

1136
01:21:27,908 --> 01:21:28,908
Pardon me?

1137
01:21:29,074 --> 01:21:31,463
Show me your dick and I might not fire you.

1138
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
It's pretty.

1139
01:21:51,175 --> 01:21:53,175
Manon.

1140
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:56,175
You look circumcised.

1141
01:21:59,699 --> 01:22:01,158
I still get the 10 grand?

1142
01:22:02,783 --> 01:22:03,783
That's a no.

1143
01:22:04,449 --> 01:22:06,367
And delete all that.

1144
01:22:29,658 --> 01:22:31,283
Fantastic!

1145
01:24:03,324 --> 01:24:05,658
Get out!

1146
01:24:06,324 --> 01:24:07,742
Get out!

1147
01:24:07,867 --> 01:24:09,283
Get out of here!

1148
01:24:11,449 --> 01:24:12,949
Get out!

1149
01:25:19,574 --> 01:25:21,658
A wave of enthusiasm in Spain.

1150
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:25,742
Pope Francis will join crowds
of pilgrims walking barefoot

1151
01:25:25,824 --> 01:25:28,992
on the road to Santiago de Compostela.

1152
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:30,199
In France,

1153
01:25:30,283 --> 01:25:33,117
Georges Leblanc stays in
prison, unsurprisingly.

1154
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:35,283
The serial killer failed

1155
01:25:35,367 --> 01:25:38,617
in his latest application for parole.

1156
01:25:38,783 --> 01:25:41,949
Georges Leblanc is 76 years old.

1157
01:25:42,033 --> 01:25:45,283
He must wait ten years to apply again.

1158
01:25:45,449 --> 01:25:47,324
His lawyers announced he...

1159
01:25:54,199 --> 01:25:56,408
Fuck you, fuck you!

1160
01:26:34,033 --> 01:26:37,783
I'm Michèle Leblanc. I called yesterday.

1161
01:26:38,742 --> 01:26:39,742
Right.

1162
01:26:40,158 --> 01:26:42,325
Wait there for someone to come get you.

1163
01:26:42,492 --> 01:26:43,492
Thank you.

1164
01:26:55,533 --> 01:26:56,533
Ms. Leblanc?

1165
01:26:58,283 --> 01:27:00,242
- I'm the Assistant Warden.
- Hi.

1166
01:27:00,449 --> 01:27:03,033
- A coffee or something?
- No, thanks.

1167
01:27:03,117 --> 01:27:06,824
Can we talk in my office if
you don't mind? This way...

1168
01:27:07,158 --> 01:27:09,617
I'm here to spit in my father's face.

1169
01:27:09,699 --> 01:27:11,588
I can't guarantee it's a metaphor.

1170
01:27:11,658 --> 01:27:13,492
People have all kinds of reasons.

1171
01:27:15,742 --> 01:27:19,117
I came because I gave the
bastard too much power over me.

1172
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:22,408
My whole life fleeing him, fearing him.

1173
01:27:23,992 --> 01:27:25,283
What a waste!

1174
01:27:25,617 --> 01:27:26,783
Ms. Leblanc...

1175
01:27:27,367 --> 01:27:28,908
Your father is dead.

1176
01:27:31,867 --> 01:27:33,242
Shortly before 8 am,

1177
01:27:33,324 --> 01:27:35,824
we found him deceased in his cell.

1178
01:27:36,867 --> 01:27:37,908
How?

1179
01:27:38,867 --> 01:27:40,259
There'll be an investigation,

1180
01:27:40,283 --> 01:27:43,783
but he appears to have
hanged himself with a sheet.

1181
01:27:54,324 --> 01:27:56,033
When did this happen?

1182
01:27:57,408 --> 01:28:01,449
We only know it must have
been between 7pm and 7am.

1183
01:28:09,033 --> 01:28:12,574
At what time was my father
notified that I was coming today?

1184
01:28:16,408 --> 01:28:18,367
Shortly before 7pm.

1185
01:28:21,074 --> 01:28:22,843
Your mother requested cremation,

1186
01:28:22,867 --> 01:28:25,408
with a vault for his ashes next to hers.

1187
01:28:25,492 --> 01:28:29,033
She won't be there, even if
her plaque's next to his.

1188
01:28:45,283 --> 01:28:47,783
I had a list of things to say to him.

1189
01:28:47,867 --> 01:28:49,533
Nine bullet points.

1190
01:28:55,074 --> 01:28:57,074
I killed you by coming here.

1191
01:29:20,867 --> 01:29:21,574
Hello?

1192
01:29:21,658 --> 01:29:23,800
Emilie Fontaine, reporter at Le Parisien.

1193
01:29:23,824 --> 01:29:28,283
I was wondering if you'd like to
comment on your father's passing.

1194
01:29:28,367 --> 01:29:30,199
How did you get this number?

1195
01:29:30,783 --> 01:29:32,574
I realize it's an awkward time.

1196
01:29:32,658 --> 01:29:34,658
It's an opportunity for you...

1197
01:29:43,074 --> 01:29:44,074
Hello?

1198
01:29:44,574 --> 01:29:45,699
Ms. Leblanc?

1199
01:29:46,867 --> 01:29:47,908
Ms. Leblanc?

1200
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:50,074
Are you feeling anger?

1201
01:29:50,824 --> 01:29:52,074
Grief?

1202
01:29:52,367 --> 01:29:54,242
Relief perhaps?

1203
01:30:08,949 --> 01:30:11,699
Anna's voice-mail. I can't take your...

1204
01:30:15,617 --> 01:30:17,824
This is Richard. Leave me a message.

1205
01:30:56,283 --> 01:30:57,574
How are you feeling?

1206
01:30:59,158 --> 01:31:00,449
How am I feeling?

1207
01:31:00,783 --> 01:31:03,033
Are you dizzy? Head spinning?

1208
01:31:03,117 --> 01:31:05,449
- No. I'm fine, I think.
- Ok.

1209
01:31:05,699 --> 01:31:07,033
Except my leg.

1210
01:31:09,574 --> 01:31:11,867
Don't bother. It's jammed.

1211
01:31:12,199 --> 01:31:14,367
Unbuckle and I'll help you out.

1212
01:31:40,533 --> 01:31:42,145
You should let me look at it.

1213
01:31:42,533 --> 01:31:43,992
I played soccer.

1214
01:31:45,408 --> 01:31:46,824
Great, so what?

1215
01:31:47,367 --> 01:31:50,367
I mean, I know a bit about leg injuries.

1216
01:31:50,908 --> 01:31:53,824
As a teen, I tore my
anterior cruciate ligament.

1217
01:31:54,158 --> 01:31:55,158
Okay?

1218
01:31:56,199 --> 01:31:57,908
One year of rehab.

1219
01:32:00,033 --> 01:32:03,992
Alright, I'd better disinfect it now.

1220
01:32:08,699 --> 01:32:09,992
A nasty sprain.

1221
01:32:10,074 --> 01:32:11,492
It needs treatment.

1222
01:32:25,492 --> 01:32:26,949
So, how was it?

1223
01:32:42,242 --> 01:32:44,158
Was it good? How was it?

1224
01:32:54,408 --> 01:32:56,367
Answer me. Did you enjoy it?

1225
01:33:08,074 --> 01:33:09,908
Why did you do it?

1226
01:33:15,867 --> 01:33:17,367
It was necessary.

1227
01:33:38,408 --> 01:33:41,033
- Have a good day, ma'am.
- Thanks. goodbye.

1228
01:33:58,824 --> 01:34:01,033
Stop it, Michèle. You can't do this.

1229
01:34:01,699 --> 01:34:02,824
What can't I do?

1230
01:34:03,074 --> 01:34:05,242
Walking in without ringing the bell.

1231
01:34:05,449 --> 01:34:08,033
I have a key, Ralf. Why ring the bell?

1232
01:34:08,408 --> 01:34:10,199
Ignore me, I won't be long.

1233
01:34:10,283 --> 01:34:12,074
It's not about how long.

1234
01:34:12,158 --> 01:34:14,634
- Don't be unpleasant. -You
have to go immediately.

1235
01:34:14,658 --> 01:34:16,617
I own this apartment!

1236
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:18,817
Yes, well I will be going...

1237
01:34:19,841 --> 01:34:21,841
This is not the time.

1238
01:34:22,841 --> 01:34:25,175
Anyway I put on sale, that's why I'm here.

1239
01:34:28,867 --> 01:34:30,699
I saw your father passed away.

1240
01:34:31,783 --> 01:34:33,699
One less bastard in the world.

1241
01:34:36,492 --> 01:34:38,783
You should start packing your bags.

1242
01:34:40,742 --> 01:34:43,533
I saw all the shows on TV
about you and your dad.

1243
01:34:43,824 --> 01:34:45,769
When you murdered all those people.

1244
01:34:52,242 --> 01:34:54,742
I saw all the corpses,
all the dead children.

1245
01:35:00,074 --> 01:35:03,408
The bastard's dead now, and
at least I fucked his wife.

1246
01:35:13,658 --> 01:35:14,408
Hello?

1247
01:35:14,492 --> 01:35:15,283
It's Robert.

1248
01:35:15,367 --> 01:35:18,423
Anna's gone to her London meeting.
My afternoon's free.

1249
01:35:18,617 --> 01:35:19,617
Robert.

1250
01:35:20,033 --> 01:35:20,908
I was going to call.

1251
01:35:20,992 --> 01:35:23,574
I sprained my knee. It's in a brace.

1252
01:35:23,949 --> 01:35:25,367
I can hardly walk.

1253
01:35:25,742 --> 01:35:28,199
So? We're not going skiing.

1254
01:35:51,867 --> 01:35:52,992
You were fabulous.

1255
01:35:53,074 --> 01:35:55,352
Where'd you get the idea of playing dead?

1256
01:35:56,117 --> 01:35:57,895
Anyway. you got what you wanted.

1257
01:35:58,824 --> 01:36:00,408
See, I'm as good as my word.

1258
01:36:00,574 --> 01:36:01,867
Now that...

1259
01:36:02,367 --> 01:36:05,117
It was a very peculiar sensation.

1260
01:36:06,949 --> 01:36:08,533
So we can still be friends.

1261
01:36:11,324 --> 01:36:13,213
You know what I mean by "friends"?

1262
01:36:14,199 --> 01:36:15,324
No more fucking.

1263
01:36:23,783 --> 01:36:24,824
Vincent.

1264
01:36:30,199 --> 01:36:31,533
What are you doing here?

1265
01:36:34,533 --> 01:36:36,199
Josie kicked me out.

1266
01:36:36,949 --> 01:36:38,199
What happened?

1267
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:40,408
I don't know.

1268
01:36:41,658 --> 01:36:43,117
So think about it.

1269
01:36:43,699 --> 01:36:45,925
There must be a reason, however demented.

1270
01:36:45,949 --> 01:36:47,283
There's a reason.

1271
01:36:47,867 --> 01:36:49,158
I lost my job.

1272
01:36:49,783 --> 01:36:50,783
Lost?

1273
01:36:51,242 --> 01:36:52,492
I resigned.

1274
01:36:52,533 --> 01:36:54,574
- You resigned?
- I had to.

1275
01:36:54,742 --> 01:36:56,158
My car broke down.

1276
01:36:57,074 --> 01:36:59,574
You resigned because your car broke down?

1277
01:36:59,658 --> 01:37:02,783
It's one hour there, one
hour back, from the house.

1278
01:37:02,867 --> 01:37:04,242
That's unhealthy.

1279
01:37:05,408 --> 01:37:08,699
I saw a thing on TV about
air quality in the subway.

1280
01:37:12,033 --> 01:37:13,574
You brought him here?

1281
01:37:16,699 --> 01:37:19,117
- I had no choice.
- No choice?

1282
01:37:20,992 --> 01:37:23,324
Josie threatened to go to America.

1283
01:37:24,074 --> 01:37:25,297
And take Lucien along.

1284
01:37:25,324 --> 01:37:28,617
I can't believe I'm defending her

1285
01:37:28,699 --> 01:37:30,908
but she has a right to be mad at you.

1286
01:37:31,324 --> 01:37:34,949
You have responsibilities, an
apartment, and you quit your job?

1287
01:37:35,033 --> 01:37:37,158
You say it exactly like her.

1288
01:37:37,242 --> 01:37:39,824
My car broke down. That's not my fault!

1289
01:37:39,908 --> 01:37:42,324
You have to give that baby back right now.

1290
01:37:42,408 --> 01:37:45,175
You're not married. It could
be seen as kidnapping.

1291
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:46,658
Kidnapping? He's my son!

1292
01:37:48,533 --> 01:37:49,242
My son!

1293
01:37:49,324 --> 01:37:50,658
Alright, he's your son.

1294
01:37:50,742 --> 01:37:51,949
No, not alright.

1295
01:37:55,158 --> 01:37:56,617
Who could that be?

1296
01:38:02,867 --> 01:38:03,742
Where is he?

1297
01:38:03,824 --> 01:38:05,283
- Who?
- My baby!

1298
01:38:06,324 --> 01:38:08,449
- Where is he?
- Upstairs.

1299
01:38:09,742 --> 01:38:12,074
My baby! What did you do to him?

1300
01:38:12,449 --> 01:38:13,367
What did I do to him?

1301
01:38:13,449 --> 01:38:15,783
I wouldn't trust you with a hamster!

1302
01:38:16,199 --> 01:38:18,283
Let go! Let go of me!

1303
01:38:18,367 --> 01:38:19,658
Let go of her.

1304
01:38:19,742 --> 01:38:21,449
Let go of me, dammit!

1305
01:38:21,533 --> 01:38:23,242
Let go of her!

1306
01:38:23,324 --> 01:38:24,658
Let go of me!

1307
01:38:27,533 --> 01:38:28,574
Vincent!

1308
01:38:28,867 --> 01:38:29,992
What?

1309
01:38:33,492 --> 01:38:35,242
He's my baby, get it?

1310
01:38:37,158 --> 01:38:38,617
My child!

1311
01:38:50,949 --> 01:38:53,533
It was always about the baby for you.

1312
01:38:54,783 --> 01:38:56,699
You were in it for his sake.

1313
01:38:58,908 --> 01:39:00,617
I could be a good father.

1314
01:39:01,658 --> 01:39:02,824
I know it.

1315
01:39:09,658 --> 01:39:10,658
These?

1316
01:39:12,658 --> 01:39:14,324
Sure, but unsalted ones.

1317
01:39:17,117 --> 01:39:18,574
Hi, Vincent.

1318
01:39:19,283 --> 01:39:20,574
- Okay?
- And you?

1319
01:39:20,617 --> 01:39:23,449
Buy Bonne Vie. They're made in Florange.

1320
01:39:29,658 --> 01:39:30,908
Evening, Michèle.

1321
01:39:32,408 --> 01:39:33,699
How's your knee?

1322
01:39:34,367 --> 01:39:35,423
And you? Your hand?

1323
01:39:37,033 --> 01:39:38,134
Patrick said Bonne Vie unsalted chips

1324
01:39:38,158 --> 01:39:40,617
are made in Florange.

1325
01:39:42,617 --> 01:39:45,324
Rebecca's on a trip and
left tons of lasagna.

1326
01:39:45,617 --> 01:39:47,617
I'll never be able to finish it.

1327
01:39:48,699 --> 01:39:50,617
I got this to go with it.

1328
01:39:52,117 --> 01:39:53,449
Sounds good to me.

1329
01:39:57,992 --> 01:39:59,617
Yes. sure.

1330
01:40:01,199 --> 01:40:02,533
No, thanks.

1331
01:40:05,283 --> 01:40:07,339
Where did Rebecca and her parents go?

1332
01:40:07,742 --> 01:40:10,283
To see the Pope in Santiago de Compostela.

1333
01:40:11,324 --> 01:40:13,199
Driving and on foot at the end.

1334
01:40:13,283 --> 01:40:15,949
I saw he'll be saying
mass in the cathedral.

1335
01:40:17,074 --> 01:40:18,074
The Pope.

1336
01:40:18,367 --> 01:40:21,908
I have a hard time imagining
the guy barefoot.

1337
01:40:22,283 --> 01:40:25,949
It's so weird to think he's a
real person, like with feet.

1338
01:40:30,324 --> 01:40:32,158
Go easy, sweetheart.

1339
01:40:45,117 --> 01:40:46,158
He's out.

1340
01:40:47,074 --> 01:40:48,949
Eyes bigger than his belly.

1341
01:40:50,324 --> 01:40:51,574
Thank you.

1342
01:41:23,824 --> 01:41:25,492
The floor's warm.

1343
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:30,699
It's a wood boiler. I installed it myself.

1344
01:41:32,533 --> 01:41:33,908
Sounds like a job.

1345
01:41:34,742 --> 01:41:36,158
Yes.

1346
01:41:37,117 --> 01:41:39,199
Works by inverted flame combustion.

1347
01:41:41,117 --> 01:41:43,199
Inverted flame combustion?

1348
01:41:43,908 --> 01:41:46,824
- Sounds like you just made it up.
- No.

1349
01:41:47,324 --> 01:41:48,824
I'm not making anything up.

1350
01:41:58,199 --> 01:41:59,449
It's in the basement.

1351
01:42:05,408 --> 01:42:06,824
I can imagine.

1352
01:42:10,783 --> 01:42:12,199
You want to see it?

1353
01:42:21,574 --> 01:42:22,574
Ok.

1354
01:43:01,449 --> 01:43:02,574
There we are.

1355
01:43:04,992 --> 01:43:07,367
All noise is muffled by the door.

1356
01:43:19,324 --> 01:43:21,213
- Vincent's upstairs.
- Yes, he is.

1357
01:43:34,449 --> 01:43:35,449
Do it.

1358
01:43:41,574 --> 01:43:43,617
It doesn't work like that.

1359
01:43:44,367 --> 01:43:45,492
Not for me.

1360
01:43:46,699 --> 01:43:48,117
It has to be like before.

1361
01:44:55,408 --> 01:44:56,658
Let's go.

1362
01:45:10,908 --> 01:45:12,367
Thank you for dinner.

1363
01:45:12,449 --> 01:45:13,449
Anytime.

1364
01:45:45,658 --> 01:45:46,658
Kurt.

1365
01:45:48,033 --> 01:45:49,199
Bravo.

1366
01:45:53,367 --> 01:45:55,867
Anna, I have an idea.

1367
01:45:56,199 --> 01:45:57,866
The party for the game launch.

1368
01:45:57,908 --> 01:45:59,908
We could ask Vincent to organize it.

1369
01:46:00,117 --> 01:46:01,199
Good idea.

1370
01:46:01,367 --> 01:46:05,324
I know I was always against
throwing work Vincent's way but...

1371
01:46:08,117 --> 01:46:09,283
What's wrong?

1372
01:46:13,408 --> 01:46:15,033
Robert's fucking someone.

1373
01:46:19,408 --> 01:46:20,658
Are you sure?

1374
01:46:24,367 --> 01:46:26,199
I recognized the scent

1375
01:46:26,408 --> 01:46:29,408
of that stupid body wash they use in hotels

1376
01:46:29,492 --> 01:46:31,242
trying to be classy.

1377
01:46:31,617 --> 01:46:33,367
We don't have that at home.

1378
01:46:36,574 --> 01:46:38,242
That's your only evidence?

1379
01:46:42,033 --> 01:46:43,992
I smelled his underwear.

1380
01:46:48,074 --> 01:46:51,574
I waited all day for him
to take off his shorts.

1381
01:46:52,033 --> 01:46:56,033
When he did at last, I pounced on them.
And sniffed.

1382
01:46:57,992 --> 01:46:59,617
I felt ashamed beyond words.

1383
01:47:00,908 --> 01:47:05,033
Shame isn't a strong enough emotion
to stop us doing anything at all.

1384
01:47:06,617 --> 01:47:07,783
Believe me.

1385
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:29,617
You're becoming a regular.

1386
01:47:29,699 --> 01:47:31,158
Looks like it.

1387
01:47:31,242 --> 01:47:33,533
- Your wife?
- Couldn't make it.

1388
01:47:35,408 --> 01:47:36,686
What do you mean, "Ah"?

1389
01:47:36,783 --> 01:47:39,449
We should've come together.
Carpooling is hip.

1390
01:47:40,199 --> 01:47:42,158
How are you?

1391
01:47:42,533 --> 01:47:46,158
Fauchon made this up for us.
Taste that. it's awesome.

1392
01:47:46,617 --> 01:47:48,492
- Hi.
- Hi.

1393
01:47:48,574 --> 01:47:49,574
Right this way.

1394
01:47:50,158 --> 01:47:51,425
You're maitre d' tonight?

1395
01:47:51,449 --> 01:47:54,908
Mom put me in charge of the party.

1396
01:47:55,242 --> 01:47:56,367
Evening.

1397
01:47:57,408 --> 01:47:59,033
- How are you?
- Fine.

1398
01:47:59,949 --> 01:48:01,384
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1399
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:03,199
- How are you?
- Good.

1400
01:48:04,242 --> 01:48:06,574
Sorry, lipstick on your cheek.

1401
01:48:07,492 --> 01:48:09,199
Welcome to my home.

1402
01:48:10,074 --> 01:48:11,324
Want to give it a try?

1403
01:48:11,742 --> 01:48:13,367
No, thanks, I'm no gamer.

1404
01:48:13,408 --> 01:48:14,033
Really?

1405
01:48:14,117 --> 01:48:16,574
- I'd love a go. Show me?
- Ok.

1406
01:48:19,742 --> 01:48:21,409
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1407
01:48:21,574 --> 01:48:22,797
Can I get you a drink?

1408
01:48:22,867 --> 01:48:24,742
- Champagne?
- Red wine, please.

1409
01:48:24,824 --> 01:48:26,324
I'll switch to red, too.

1410
01:48:26,408 --> 01:48:28,992
- Champagne for you?
- No, I'm good.

1411
01:48:30,574 --> 01:48:31,949
Bottle of red, please.

1412
01:48:32,158 --> 01:48:34,242
I was told to pour glasses.

1413
01:48:34,783 --> 01:48:35,867
I'm in charge here.

1414
01:48:35,949 --> 01:48:37,838
I was given specific instructions.

1415
01:48:37,992 --> 01:48:39,658
Whiskey here, please.

1416
01:48:47,492 --> 01:48:49,117
Faster, much faster!

1417
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:50,992
You can press the circle.

1418
01:48:51,283 --> 01:48:52,783
Get him moving now.

1419
01:48:52,867 --> 01:48:54,158
Press there to jump.

1420
01:48:57,074 --> 01:48:59,033
You didn't bring Hélène?

1421
01:48:59,617 --> 01:49:01,074
We've met now.

1422
01:49:02,158 --> 01:49:04,783
I won't lie to you. It's over.

1423
01:49:05,199 --> 01:49:06,783
What happened?

1424
01:49:08,408 --> 01:49:12,199
Laying in bed, I asked her which
of my books was her favorite.

1425
01:49:12,658 --> 01:49:14,992
Why'd you do that?

1426
01:49:15,074 --> 01:49:16,742
She said Scent of Poplar.

1427
01:49:17,158 --> 01:49:18,617
Scent of Poplar

1428
01:49:19,074 --> 01:49:21,533
is a novel by one Pierre Casamayou.

1429
01:49:32,533 --> 01:49:34,783
I'd no idea there were two Casamayous.

1430
01:49:34,867 --> 01:49:36,658
Apparently, he's talented.

1431
01:49:38,699 --> 01:49:39,908
Poor Richard.

1432
01:49:40,158 --> 01:49:42,492
Yes, poor Richard.

1433
01:49:56,117 --> 01:49:57,617
So...

1434
01:49:58,074 --> 01:50:01,992
it looks like somehow,
despite our best efforts,

1435
01:50:02,324 --> 01:50:04,742
we have a success on our hands.

1436
01:50:05,742 --> 01:50:08,074
All I can say is thank you.

1437
01:50:08,158 --> 01:50:11,699
To your good health and hip hip hooray!

1438
01:50:16,283 --> 01:50:23,867
Michèle! Michèle! Michèle!

1439
01:50:23,949 --> 01:50:25,574
Michèle! Michèle!

1440
01:50:29,158 --> 01:50:31,324
Well...

1441
01:50:31,533 --> 01:50:34,242
I couldn't put it any better.

1442
01:50:36,408 --> 01:50:38,117
Have a great evening!

1443
01:50:42,492 --> 01:50:43,824
Have you met Richard?

1444
01:50:43,949 --> 01:50:47,658
Some time ago, Richard pitched
a very interesting idea.

1445
01:50:47,742 --> 01:50:51,574
You two working together could
make something fabulous of it.

1446
01:50:51,783 --> 01:50:53,033
I think, at least.

1447
01:50:53,742 --> 01:50:56,033
Talk it over.

1448
01:50:57,199 --> 01:50:59,199
This isn't charity?

1449
01:50:59,283 --> 01:51:03,367
You should know me better than that.

1450
01:51:03,449 --> 01:51:05,699
Go on, tell him your idea.

1451
01:51:07,492 --> 01:51:09,324
So, it's set in a...

1452
01:51:09,449 --> 01:51:11,283
Let me get you a drink.

1453
01:51:16,117 --> 01:51:18,533
We can go whenever you want, darling.

1454
01:51:18,699 --> 01:51:21,324
We'll have more fun in bed than here.

1455
01:51:46,574 --> 01:51:48,574
How about a whiskey, guys?

1456
01:51:50,658 --> 01:51:52,468
Give me a minute, then we can go.

1457
01:51:52,492 --> 01:51:54,117
Whatever you say.

1458
01:51:58,199 --> 01:52:00,574
Two whiskeys and an OJ, please.

1459
01:52:03,033 --> 01:52:04,199
It's going great!

1460
01:52:06,908 --> 01:52:08,117
It's me.

1461
01:52:09,074 --> 01:52:10,158
What's you?

1462
01:52:12,658 --> 01:52:14,658
It's me, sleeping with Robert.

1463
01:52:18,658 --> 01:52:20,908
It's over now, but it was me.

1464
01:52:32,117 --> 01:52:33,199
How long?

1465
01:52:33,742 --> 01:52:34,908
6-8 months.

1466
01:52:42,324 --> 01:52:43,867
I didn't have a clue.

1467
01:52:44,617 --> 01:52:45,992
I know.

1468
01:53:00,158 --> 01:53:01,617
What did you do?

1469
01:53:02,574 --> 01:53:04,242
I stopped lying.

1470
01:53:17,949 --> 01:53:19,283
- See you.
- See you.

1471
01:53:21,449 --> 01:53:23,672
Take my keys. Patrick's driving me home.

1472
01:53:23,699 --> 01:53:26,367
- You're leaving already?
- You did wonderfully.

1473
01:53:26,449 --> 01:53:27,492
Relax.

1474
01:53:27,867 --> 01:53:28,867
See you.

1475
01:53:45,283 --> 01:53:46,699
It's twisted.

1476
01:53:49,324 --> 01:53:50,324
- Sorry?
- Twisted.

1477
01:53:50,408 --> 01:53:53,199
Between us, it's sick. Diseased.

1478
01:53:57,824 --> 01:54:01,324
I was in some kind of weird
denial but I see clearly now.

1479
01:54:04,783 --> 01:54:06,283
What do you see?

1480
01:54:08,283 --> 01:54:11,228
You don't expect to get away
with what you did to me?

1481
01:54:15,617 --> 01:54:17,992
I'll do what I should've done at once.

1482
01:54:19,117 --> 01:54:20,367
What do you mean?

1483
01:54:20,699 --> 01:54:23,658
It's not just about me.
There's your wife, too.

1484
01:54:25,492 --> 01:54:27,283
And others, perhaps.

1485
01:54:28,324 --> 01:54:29,408
Who knows.

1486
01:54:31,283 --> 01:54:32,367
What do you mean?

1487
01:54:32,449 --> 01:54:36,158
How many others? That you've
done the same thing to?

1488
01:54:40,742 --> 01:54:44,199
I'll go to the police.
I'll tell them everything.

1489
01:58:14,492 --> 01:58:16,367
Why?

1490
01:58:37,617 --> 01:58:39,949
It's over.

1491
01:58:49,533 --> 01:58:51,199
It's over.

1492
01:58:54,033 --> 01:58:55,242
It's over.

1493
01:59:05,492 --> 01:59:06,699
Ms. Leblanc?

1494
01:59:16,908 --> 01:59:18,158
- Hello.
- Hello.

1495
01:59:27,492 --> 01:59:30,658
What was your relationship
with the deceased?

1496
01:59:34,117 --> 01:59:35,699
He was my neighbor.

1497
01:59:36,324 --> 01:59:39,658
Like have-a-cup-of-coffee neighbor?

1498
01:59:40,242 --> 01:59:42,283
Borrow-the-lawnmower neighbor?

1499
01:59:42,992 --> 01:59:46,117
No, I never borrowed his lawnmower.

1500
01:59:46,199 --> 01:59:47,908
But it was...

1501
01:59:48,742 --> 01:59:51,117
Yes, that kind of neighbor.

1502
01:59:51,199 --> 01:59:52,867
Until maybe...

1503
01:59:54,867 --> 01:59:55,867
recently.

1504
01:59:56,199 --> 01:59:58,449
When he attended this party with you?

1505
01:59:59,742 --> 02:00:00,742
Yes.

1506
02:00:01,033 --> 02:00:03,783
That's when your relationship became

1507
02:00:04,492 --> 02:00:06,367
more personal?

1508
02:00:10,242 --> 02:00:11,949
Yes. I mean...

1509
02:00:13,699 --> 02:00:15,658
It was heading in that direction.

1510
02:00:17,908 --> 02:00:20,699
When this man appeared
in your house, masked,

1511
02:00:21,492 --> 02:00:26,117
you never suspected for a moment
it might be your neighbor?

1512
02:00:29,908 --> 02:00:32,283
Who could imagine such a thing?

1513
02:00:50,699 --> 02:00:52,755
- The color okay for you?
- Just fine.

1514
02:00:52,908 --> 02:00:54,033
It's perfect.

1515
02:01:07,242 --> 02:01:09,449
Careful, the statues are fragile.

1516
02:01:09,492 --> 02:01:10,617
Rebecca!

1517
02:01:13,492 --> 02:01:14,699
Hi.

1518
02:01:16,117 --> 02:01:17,699
You found a buyer?

1519
02:01:17,908 --> 02:01:20,075
I took a bit of a hit, but not too bad.

1520
02:01:20,117 --> 02:01:22,117
The realtor did a great job.

1521
02:01:22,449 --> 02:01:24,675
I'll give you his details. If ever you...

1522
02:01:24,699 --> 02:01:26,742
I'm not going anywhere.

1523
02:01:31,324 --> 02:01:32,908
Stuff piles up.

1524
02:01:34,283 --> 02:01:35,992
I wanted you to know...

1525
02:01:36,992 --> 02:01:38,367
I'm...

1526
02:01:39,742 --> 02:01:42,449
I'm very sorry for all you've been through.

1527
02:01:44,574 --> 02:01:46,367
Fortunately, I have faith.

1528
02:01:47,117 --> 02:01:49,784
What's it for if not to
get through tough times?

1529
02:01:50,742 --> 02:01:54,783
Patrick was a good man but
he had a tortured soul.

1530
02:02:01,742 --> 02:02:03,658
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1531
02:02:06,492 --> 02:02:07,492
Michèle!

1532
02:02:09,158 --> 02:02:12,283
I'm sincerely glad you could
give him what he needed.

1533
02:02:12,367 --> 02:02:13,783
For a time, at least.

1534
02:02:32,283 --> 02:02:33,492
Hey there!

1535
02:02:34,242 --> 02:02:35,699
Wow, beautiful!

1536
02:02:35,783 --> 02:02:36,783
Check it out.

1537
02:02:36,949 --> 02:02:38,449
Josie let me choose.

1538
02:02:40,117 --> 02:02:41,242
A convertible.

1539
02:02:41,324 --> 02:02:42,617
He's earned it.

1540
02:02:42,699 --> 02:02:43,867
Hello.

1541
02:02:47,617 --> 02:02:48,949
Let's go.

1542
02:02:51,324 --> 02:02:52,617
Baby!

1543
02:02:58,199 --> 02:02:59,199
Happy?

1544
02:03:00,492 --> 02:03:01,699
Crazy!

1545
02:03:29,117 --> 02:03:30,574
I heard you were here.

1546
02:03:35,533 --> 02:03:36,992
Physically, anyway.

1547
02:03:48,783 --> 02:03:51,050
We're going ahead with Richard's project?

1548
02:03:51,074 --> 02:03:53,324
Let him fool around for a while.

1549
02:03:55,699 --> 02:03:57,283
How's Robert?

1550
02:03:59,908 --> 02:04:02,283
- I kicked him out.
- No.

1551
02:04:02,824 --> 02:04:04,992
Ever since, he's hit the bottle.

1552
02:04:05,992 --> 02:04:07,658
What did you see in him?

1553
02:04:08,283 --> 02:04:10,074
It was just one of those things.

1554
02:04:10,533 --> 02:04:11,699
An opportunity.

1555
02:04:12,783 --> 02:04:14,117
I wanted to get laid.

1556
02:04:17,074 --> 02:04:20,199
That's no excuse. It was shabby.

1557
02:04:21,699 --> 02:04:23,283
Worse than that even.

1558
02:04:33,949 --> 02:04:35,658
Vincent's grown up now.

1559
02:04:36,742 --> 02:04:38,158
It's just the two of us.

1560
02:04:39,658 --> 02:04:41,908
And I'm all alone in that huge house.

1561
02:04:42,992 --> 02:04:44,283
I'm going to sell it.

1562
02:04:45,617 --> 02:04:49,617
I was thinking I could move
in with you for a while.
