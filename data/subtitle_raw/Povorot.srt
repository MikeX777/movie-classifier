00:00:04,673 --> 00:00:08,187
Mosfilm

00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:25,433
Third Creative
Association

3
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:38,457
Irina Kupchenko

4
00:00:38,577 --> 00:00:40,108
Irina Kupchenko
Oleg Yankovsky

5
00:00:49,148 --> 00:00:50,336
in

6
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:52,626
THE TURNING POINT

7
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:14,059
- Mmm... Quite an edible shish kebab.
- Yes.

8
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,260
This, however, cannot
be said of the perch.

9
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:17,338
Yeah?

10
00:02:18,553 --> 00:02:22,637
I've noticed you order the perch
every single time.

11
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:24,548
How do you explain that?

12
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:29,790
- Well, we're on the high seas.
- You’re right.

13
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:32,079
This is the second time
we've been at this table,

14
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,056
and we haven't gotten
to know each other yet.

15
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:36,704
Viktor... Vedeneev.

16
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:39,414
Nikitin. At your service!

17
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,835
- Albina.
- Nice to meet you.

18
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:46,279
Well! Now introduce
your lover.

19
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:48,899
What makes you think
I'm his lover?

20
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,105
Well, you can see it
with the naked eye.

21
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:53,141
Indeed?

22
00:02:53,192 --> 00:02:55,999
- You're observant.
- I'm sorry, what's your name?

23
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:57,352
Natasha.

24
00:02:57,585 --> 00:03:00,283
So, to the question
of observation, Natasha.

25
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:03,210
Your engagement ring,

26
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:06,956
it's shiny.
It’s new.

27
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:11,151
It hasn't had time to fade yet
from the laundry and the dishes.

28
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:13,454
Bravo!

29
00:03:13,574 --> 00:03:15,685
You are newlyweds and I propose a toast:

30
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:16,807
"To newlyweds!"

31
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:20,359
- To Sherlock Holmes
- Well, here we are. Hooray!

32
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,189
- Muscovites.
- Muscovites!

33
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,169
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

34
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,647
- Thank you.
- Are you going to Moscow?

35
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:34,229
You got it again!

36
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:35,934
Thank you.

37
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:37,996
And we are also
going to visit the Crimea!

38
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:41,443
- Going to work on Monday?!
- Yes.

39
00:03:41,563 --> 00:03:43,524
Going to work on Monday.

40
00:03:45,563 --> 00:03:49,852
Do you actually work as...
Sherlock Holmes?

41
00:03:51,955 --> 00:03:55,662
In a way. A lawyer, generally speaking.

42
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:59,123
But that's not the point, if you want,
I can give you

43
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:00,681
some lessons in deduction and you

44
00:04:00,771 --> 00:04:03,945
too will impress some
neighbors at the table.

45
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:05,804
It's not hard at all.

46
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:07,703
- One last dance.
- Yes!

47
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:10,092
- That’s right, let's go dance.
- Let's go.

48
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,027
Natasha!

49
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,130
Hello!

50
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:14,367
Ouch! Listen, let's get out of here.

51
00:05:14,661 --> 00:05:16,587
- This is awkward.
- It's okay.

52
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,770
You take the stern; I'll take the bar.
Let's go!

53
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:55,750
Look, they won't leave us alone.

54
00:06:57,348 --> 00:07:00,361
They like us,
what's the problem?

55
00:07:01,024 --> 00:07:02,866
They want to be friends.

56
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:06,028
And you, selfish girl!

57
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:07,386
- Me?
- Yes.

58
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,398
- Is it bad?
- So...

59
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:13,208
- I don't need anyone but you.
- Don’t you?

60
00:07:13,946 --> 00:07:16,460
Let’s just tell them... to get lost.

61
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:18,439
Great idea!

62
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:31,907
I think they're gone.

63
00:07:42,614 --> 00:07:46,881
Listen! It's not gonna work.
They're in love with us.

64
00:07:49,915 --> 00:07:51,141
More than enough!

65
00:07:53,351 --> 00:07:55,561
We certainly overestimated
their feelings.

66
00:08:00,895 --> 00:08:03,148
To Moscow! To Moscow!

67
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:20,766
Natasha!

68
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:23,261
- Natasha!
- Mmm...

69
00:09:23,381 --> 00:09:25,027
That's it, we're here!

70
00:09:25,762 --> 00:09:27,474
Vacation's over.

71
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,387
Natasha!

72
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,861
How? Really?

73
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:35,485
No, no.

74
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:50,872
Natashka, don't sleep!

75
00:09:51,412 --> 00:09:53,965
We'll be home in a minute,
you can sleep like a human being.

76
00:09:54,382 --> 00:09:56,143
All right, all right.

77
00:10:24,815 --> 00:10:28,251
- What happened?
- I don't know.

78
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:34,081
Okay, what's up?

79
00:10:34,684 --> 00:10:36,531
Have you had enough?

80
00:10:36,868 --> 00:10:39,030
I've had enough, I'm telling you.

81
00:10:39,983 --> 00:10:42,123
I see, you're a racer!

82
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,718
So, you got it?

83
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,869
Got it?

84
00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:52,354
You come over here, they're
going to give you a prize. Go on!

85
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,167
We should call an ambulance.

86
00:10:55,218 --> 00:10:56,595
- So?
- Yes, they've been called.

87
00:10:56,646 --> 00:10:58,487
- Get that dog out of here.
- Rex!

88
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:03,275
- She’s got a pulse. That's right.
- It's not the pulse, it's a finish!

89
00:11:03,326 --> 00:11:04,560
- Don't you know?
- What?

90
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,401
She came out of the bushes
out of nowhere...

91
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:07,602
At least pretend in public.

92
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:09,347
- What do you mean?
- "What do you mean?"

93
00:11:09,398 --> 00:11:11,344
- If you close your eyes – hold on!
- I do!

94
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:13,399
- I see how you do it.
- What's the matter?

95
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,308
He's not sober. His
legs aren't holding him up.

96
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:16,623
He's walking, wobbly.

97
00:11:16,674 --> 00:11:18,282
- Who's wobbling?
- Can't you see who?

98
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:20,137
That’s silly!
Keep your nonsense to yourself.

99
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:22,852
- Wobbly.
- Can't you see I'm okay?

100
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,042
- What's wrong with you? You're wobbly.
- Really?

101
00:11:27,736 --> 00:11:30,532
- You guys come over here.
- Yeah, okay. Well, what do you want?

102
00:11:30,652 --> 00:11:32,289
- Come over here!
- Yeah, okay.

103
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:34,327
Well, what?
What are you doing? Let me go!

104
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:35,547
Let me go! That's enough!

105
00:11:35,713 --> 00:11:37,596
Yes. In the tube,
breathe into the tube.

106
00:11:37,716 --> 00:11:40,145
I'll bring you a tube.
and then you can breathe.

107
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,101
- Let me go!
- You talk too much!

108
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:45,575
Yeah, get him out of here!
Get him out of here!

109
00:11:47,696 --> 00:11:49,856
Get it off! Let me go!

110
00:11:50,935 --> 00:11:53,488
Now you'll get a Section 206, too.

111
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:56,636
- Leave him alone.
- Don't hurt his hands!

112
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,097
Relax your arm.

113
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:13,874
Relax your arm.

114
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:17,357
Please.

115
00:12:17,848 --> 00:12:19,399
You didn't seem to relax it.

116
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:23,163
And now?

117
00:12:24,726 --> 00:12:27,129
Yeah, yeah. Got it.

118
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,373
Okay.

119
00:12:31,732 --> 00:12:33,373
Okay.

120
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:38,404
- All right!
- Well, Vitya...

121
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,236
It's sad enough,
but it's not that bad.

122
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:44,223
- Mild concussion, two fractures.
- Yeah?

123
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:47,644
Here, Comrade Captain,
did me a favor and called me.

124
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:51,365
You can go now.
Did you take a blood test?

125
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,338
- Yes, I did.
- Go home, take it easy.

126
00:12:53,389 --> 00:12:54,254
You'll be called.

127
00:12:54,304 --> 00:12:56,095
The main thing is
that it's not a big deal.

128
00:12:56,146 --> 00:12:58,314
That's the main thing,
isn't it, Comrade Captain?

129
00:12:58,365 --> 00:12:59,447
Pray to God.

130
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:36,504
Symposium. See?

131
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:41,242
Estonians invited us for four days.

132
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:49,756
Well, what are you up to
at night, Natasha?

133
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:51,122
Now.

134
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,810
That's the way it's been since March.

135
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,185
I’ve already asked you,
can't you do it in the morning?

136
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:15,211
Let's have a decent dinner.

137
00:14:19,095 --> 00:14:22,504
Natasha! Natasha!

138
00:14:30,193 --> 00:14:34,336
Really? Well, well, well!
What happened?

139
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:39,753
So, what to do? Natasha.
Stop it!

140
00:14:39,873 --> 00:14:43,640
Don’t do it. What are you doing?

141
00:14:44,253 --> 00:14:48,242
Stop... That's enough! Come on!

142
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,395
That's all right.

143
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:56,927
It could have been worse.

144
00:14:57,614 --> 00:15:01,541
Come on, stop it! Come on, stop it!
Natasha!

145
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,892
That's it! Stop it! That's it!

146
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:10,708
- That's it?
- That's it!

147
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,481
So!

148
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,533
[Victor laughed]

149
00:15:59,946 --> 00:16:01,389
Hello, young lady!

150
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,556
Please take this.
Anna Egorovna Koroleva.

151
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:08,932
- May I come in?
- Sure.

152
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,703
Hello.

153
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,337
I don't feel comfortable
bothering you over nothing.

154
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:19,002
What do you mean?
Have a seat.

155
00:16:19,122 --> 00:16:22,626
- Thank you, I won't be long.
- Okay, sit down.

156
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:33,984
The thing is...

157
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:38,342
It's hard for me to
tell you this, but...

158
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,953
Your care package is no longer needed.

159
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,175
Not needed?

160
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:46,798
How should that be understood?

161
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,163
You care package is not needed.

162
00:16:55,811 --> 00:16:57,008
So.

163
00:16:57,774 --> 00:16:59,109
Are you the son?

164
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:03,696
We've done everything we can.
Even more.

165
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:07,215
I see.

166
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:10,209
It's because of age.
The injury had nothing to do with it,

167
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:11,468
although it did play a part.

168
00:17:15,062 --> 00:17:16,787
Age...

169
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:22,369
Everybody loses their
parents at some point.

170
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:23,626
Yes.

171
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:29,226
I need you to go to the head doctor's
office and review the report.

172
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:33,691
Now.

173
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:36,128
- You don't feel good?
- It's okay, I'll be fine.

174
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:37,561
Zina!

175
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,999
It's ammonia, it's okay.

176
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:59,022
- I think you'd better lie down.
- That's all right, thank you.

177
00:17:59,142 --> 00:18:02,572
No, let's lie down.
Let's go.

178
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:32,398
- Okay.
- Victor Andreyevich!

179
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:35,240
I wanted to remind you
about the publication.

180
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,253
You promised to check it
before the vacation.

181
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,048
- Did you read it?
- Yes, I did.

182
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:45,288
Well, what do you want me to write?
Give me a hint.

183
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,166
Well... any of your thoughts
or...

184
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:52,602
What thoughts? Give me a hint.

185
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:58,472
- How old are you?
- Thirty.

186
00:18:58,592 --> 00:18:59,901
Thirty...

187
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:03,419
Look, it's very simple.
If you decide to cheat,

188
00:19:03,762 --> 00:19:05,935
to collect publications,

189
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,308
If you're 30 years old
and you decide to give up

190
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:09,738
on yourself, that's up to you.

191
00:19:12,006 --> 00:19:15,185
Why should I deal with it? Why should
I have think of it?

192
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:17,523
You shouldn’t, and I
do.

193
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:21,914
- Viktor Andreyevich, you’re called!
- Now.

194
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:31,039
Listen, go and see Sementsev,
he'll write it down. Okay?

195
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,694
- Viktor Andreyevich!
- Yes.

196
00:19:34,822 --> 00:19:37,224
- Is that the 17th??
- 17th.

197
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,891
I'll be right there.

198
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,567
Hello!

199
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:46,964
Hi.

200
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,822
Everything's fine.

201
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:55,709
I didn't.

202
00:19:57,134 --> 00:19:58,706
I did.

203
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:02,884
What can I say? Nothing.

204
00:20:04,122 --> 00:20:06,441
All right, neighbors, are you ready?

205
00:20:08,212 --> 00:20:10,174
Okay, eight o'clock.

206
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,625
Oh, look who's here!
Why didn't the neighbors tell?

207
00:20:12,686 --> 00:20:15,974
It's not good, it's not good to hide
your superiors.

208
00:20:17,107 --> 00:20:19,185
- Come here, come here. Hi!
- Hey!

209
00:20:19,236 --> 00:20:20,964
- So, how did you get your vacation?
- It was okay.

210
00:20:21,014 --> 00:20:22,767
- Natasha, how is she doing?
- She's fine.

211
00:20:22,818 --> 00:20:24,716
- Victor Andreyevich, hello.
- Hello, Anechka.

212
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:25,824
- Got a tan!
- Thanks.

213
00:20:25,944 --> 00:20:27,903
Showing up among the workers...
like that...

214
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:29,517
- So, Misha, are you still writing?
- I am.

215
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,618
- Victor Andreyevich, welcome!
- Hello, Slavochka.

216
00:20:31,866 --> 00:20:34,839
- Your bosses were interested in you.
- Yes?

217
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,587
- When's the defense?
- I don’t know.

218
00:20:37,707 --> 00:20:41,131
- Got any cigarettes?
- Look in your briefcase.

219
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:46,643
- Here, take a look. Tanya, show me.
- Slava!

220
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,755
- What's the occasion?
- I think it's about the business trip.

221
00:20:50,004 --> 00:20:51,238
Uh...

222
00:20:52,382 --> 00:20:53,716
What's up, guys?

223
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,347
I don't understand about the 28th.

224
00:20:55,397 --> 00:20:56,914
Ooh! We got gifts from the south!

225
00:20:57,355 --> 00:21:00,438
- Good for you. He doesn’t forget us.
- Thank you, I don't want.

226
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:02,853
- Here you go!
- My pleasure.

227
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,205
Well, neighbours,
it's not working again, is it?

228
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:06,957
Here,
take a look around the perimeter.

229
00:21:08,623 --> 00:21:09,867
Thank you.

230
00:22:39,016 --> 00:22:40,499
Vitya!

231
00:22:42,172 --> 00:22:44,120
It's you, right?

232
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:49,319
Ah... Hi.

233
00:22:50,144 --> 00:22:52,474
It’s been a while.

234
00:22:53,911 --> 00:22:56,326
- Hi, Svetka.
- Hello!

235
00:22:58,191 --> 00:23:01,465
- What are you doing here?
- What about you?

236
00:23:02,568 --> 00:23:03,903
I'm, uh...

237
00:23:05,002 --> 00:23:07,908
going to a funeral.
- Was this person close to you?

238
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:11,062
Yes. Someone I know.

239
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,346
My mom's buried here.
I'm talking about the monument.

240
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:18,103
Troubles.

241
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:22,848
Have you seen the one in the cap
and a turtleneck?

242
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,183
Cap?

243
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:25,518
No.

244
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:28,800
How have you been?

245
00:23:29,132 --> 00:23:31,072
You're a talented scientist, aren't you?

246
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,338
Yeah, kind of.

247
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:37,062
Where's your moustache?

248
00:23:40,238 --> 00:23:42,972
Did you get married,
or did you get a promotion?

249
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:46,538
Both.

250
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:50,031
Look...
And who is your wife?

251
00:23:52,206 --> 00:23:55,249
- Her name is Natasha.
- Do I know her?

252
00:23:55,911 --> 00:23:57,384
I don't think so.

253
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:01,679
Why so serious?

254
00:24:03,825 --> 00:24:05,612
I'm at a funeral.

255
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:13,308
- Do you see any of ours?
- No.

256
00:24:17,564 --> 00:24:19,213
Did you hear about Volodya?

257
00:24:19,637 --> 00:24:22,684
Volodya? Yes, I heard something.

258
00:24:26,426 --> 00:24:28,091
You have new friends.

259
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:33,657
- Why do you think so?
- Well, it's inevitable.

260
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,219
You, as a biologist should know.

261
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:40,393
Cells are renewed, so are
people.

262
00:24:42,578 --> 00:24:45,287
Too bad! Yes?

263
00:24:49,677 --> 00:24:52,112
There he is! I'm sorry,
for God's sake! I'm sorry.

264
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:54,252
Bye.

265
00:24:56,117 --> 00:24:58,934
Listen up! Wait, please.

266
00:24:59,363 --> 00:25:00,792
Wait!

267
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:02,488
Comrade!

268
00:25:03,148 --> 00:25:04,436
Comrade!

269
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,355
Let's have a drink!

270
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,674
What should we drink to?

271
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:13,513
To the rest of her soul.

272
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:16,986
- Whose?
- Hers!

273
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:22,047
Anna Egorovna Koroleva,
whom I sent to the afterlife.

274
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:32,239
- When did this happen? Why?
- That night.

275
00:26:33,688 --> 00:26:38,750
She didn't even get a chance to... read
our note and taste the apples.

276
00:26:40,551 --> 00:26:42,564
I... don't understand.

277
00:26:43,618 --> 00:26:45,902
- Did you know that?
- Yeah.

278
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:47,723
Why didn't you say anything?

279
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:54,101
- Well, what's gonna happen now?
- I don't know.

280
00:26:54,343 --> 00:26:55,600
A trial?

281
00:26:56,442 --> 00:26:57,724
Well, yes a trial.

282
00:26:57,844 --> 00:26:59,740
You're out of your mind. Stop eating!

283
00:27:01,717 --> 00:27:03,310
Do you realize what could be happening?

284
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:05,650
I mean, that changes everything.
From this very minute.

285
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:06,886
What minute?

286
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:12,061
Well, I don't know...
Should we do something? Any steps...

287
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,169
Prison! Do you understand?

288
00:27:16,405 --> 00:27:19,754
- Coffee for you?
- Yes. Coffee.

289
00:27:22,586 --> 00:27:25,806
- But what to do?
- I don't know.

290
00:27:26,017 --> 00:27:27,623
Did you talk at the institute?

291
00:27:28,942 --> 00:27:30,568
No. Why?

292
00:27:31,636 --> 00:27:34,825
But it's all going to hell.
Do you realize that?

293
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:38,813
Let's get a drink.

294
00:27:42,164 --> 00:27:45,159
He's out of his mind.
You're crazy!

295
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:51,753
It's not me. It's you.

296
00:27:55,061 --> 00:27:56,556
Cheers!

297
00:28:10,537 --> 00:28:12,261
Give me a kiss.

298
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:19,500
- Now?
- Yes! Now.

299
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:23,273
- And this is Sukhumi.
- Mm-hmm.

300
00:28:26,058 --> 00:28:29,028
Yes! We had a good time after all,
not bad.

301
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:31,618
Well, at least the weather.
is good.

302
00:28:31,695 --> 00:28:32,980
What's true is true.

303
00:28:33,177 --> 00:28:35,155
Well, you guys did
a great job calling.

304
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:36,392
Of course you did!

305
00:28:36,443 --> 00:28:38,381
Listen, Victor,
as long as the weather is good,

306
00:28:38,432 --> 00:28:41,448
let's get the motor running somewhere
in the woods or in the country.

307
00:28:41,501 --> 00:28:43,495
Do you have a country cottage?

308
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,308
- No way.
- Okay, you're still young.

309
00:28:47,507 --> 00:28:50,017
What do you do for a living?

310
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,195
- Biology.
- It’s interesting!

311
00:28:52,246 --> 00:28:54,018
I used to dream about it
when I was a kid.

312
00:28:54,068 --> 00:28:55,070
Didn't you?

313
00:28:55,475 --> 00:28:59,050
- Genetic engineering.
- That's totally cool! So, how was it?

314
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:03,742
Any luck constructing anything?
Some kind of artificial genius?

315
00:29:03,862 --> 00:29:05,946
It's just that
young people are getting into

316
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:07,839
and the whole thing's getting younger.

317
00:29:08,348 --> 00:29:10,192
Even old age is getting younger!

318
00:29:10,312 --> 00:29:11,782
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

319
00:29:15,513 --> 00:29:17,517
How long have you been in law?

320
00:29:17,568 --> 00:29:20,097
- I've been practicing law all my life.
- And who are you?

321
00:29:20,148 --> 00:29:21,278
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

322
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:23,413
Lawyer, investigator, how you...

323
00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:25,684
correctly noted - Sherlock
Holmes.

324
00:29:26,538 --> 00:29:28,369
And now I'm a prosecutor.

325
00:29:28,489 --> 00:29:30,814
- Who? You?
- What, don't I look like one?

326
00:29:31,215 --> 00:29:33,680
I've just never seen
a prosecutor.

327
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,916
Well, come on in. Admission's free.

328
00:29:38,036 --> 00:29:40,840
- Have you ever been to court?
- No, God forbid.

329
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,872
- Never?
- No.

330
00:29:42,992 --> 00:29:45,118
Well, aren't you scared
when you...

331
00:29:45,238 --> 00:29:47,299
I don't know, what are you guys
doing?

332
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:49,532
I second the accusation.

333
00:29:50,023 --> 00:29:51,791
No, that's okay.

334
00:29:52,382 --> 00:29:54,721
I understand you,
Natasha, but you know...

335
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:58,555
criminals are mostly bad
people. Honestly!

336
00:29:58,748 --> 00:30:02,259
And those who suffer from them
are mostly good people. There!

337
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,210
You and I suffer.

338
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:09,922
Hm... Now, if...

339
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:13,068
Well... how do you say?

340
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:16,463
You want to talk about my
profession?

341
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,554
No, not necessarily.

342
00:30:20,525 --> 00:30:22,521
Well, with my buddy.

343
00:30:23,091 --> 00:30:24,532
Well, I told you.

344
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:27,129
He was just driving along
and he was right under the wheels...

345
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,519
Oh, come on,
let's talk about something else.

346
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,499
Just curious.

347
00:30:32,943 --> 00:30:34,643
Here's a case like this.
The man...

348
00:30:35,362 --> 00:30:36,851
just went under the wheels himself.

349
00:30:37,771 --> 00:30:39,983
The driver was absolutely not at fault,

350
00:30:40,033 --> 00:30:42,409
He didn't do anything wrong.
Who suffers?

351
00:30:42,586 --> 00:30:45,517
Oh, honey! You can't solve these things
so easily.

352
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:49,344
He did, he didn't,
there's all sorts of reasons.

353
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:52,166
Details of the investigation.

354
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:56,618
The serviceability of the car.
Yeah, a thousand things.

355
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:58,734
And... what do you care so much about?

356
00:30:58,934 --> 00:31:00,837
You should advise your buddy
to get a lawyer.

357
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,359
No, of course not.

358
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:07,228
Excuse me if I'm being intrusive,

359
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:09,690
but is this like an accident?

360
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,813
The driver is completely sober.

361
00:31:12,933 --> 00:31:14,544
Wasn't speeding.

362
00:31:16,487 --> 00:31:18,470
What about the victim?

363
00:31:19,743 --> 00:31:22,518
- Dead.
- Right here?

364
00:31:22,915 --> 00:31:24,286
No, not there.

365
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:30,144
Yeah...

366
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,147
Again...

367
00:31:33,056 --> 00:31:35,581
A lot of tough questions.
Everything matters here.

368
00:31:35,632 --> 00:31:37,501
And the victim's vision?

369
00:31:38,136 --> 00:31:39,914
- The victim.
- The victim.

370
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:44,758
Yes, of course.
If, as you say, the old lady.

371
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:46,755
- Walked without looking.
- Without looking!

372
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:49,495
From behind the bushes. It was like..,
she was blind.

373
00:31:49,615 --> 00:31:51,599
Well, there's data on that
in the polyclinic.

374
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:53,076
But these are important points.

375
00:31:53,944 --> 00:31:56,164
Yes, of course.

376
00:31:56,825 --> 00:32:01,318
Well, I don't... I don't envy
of your buddy.

377
00:32:05,183 --> 00:32:07,221
- The tea is cold. Can I warm it up?
- Thank you.

378
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,615
No! Well,
why isn't anybody eating the cake?

379
00:32:09,665 --> 00:32:10,769
Well, you're welcome.

380
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,595
- Oh, no.
- Thank you.

381
00:32:14,163 --> 00:32:15,234
Yes...

382
00:32:15,354 --> 00:32:17,533
Really, let's talk
about something more interesting.

383
00:32:17,653 --> 00:32:19,859
It's a pity to waste time on this.
Cheers.

384
00:32:20,058 --> 00:32:21,409
Thank you.

385
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,202
And Igor can't help you.

386
00:32:34,777 --> 00:32:36,668
He's in a position
where he can't interfere

387
00:32:36,718 --> 00:32:38,704
in matters where he knows someone.

388
00:32:40,757 --> 00:32:43,822
That's you, isn't it?
Did it happen to you?

389
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:47,996
Well, there you go.
That's what I thought.

390
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,813
You know what?

391
00:32:50,077 --> 00:32:53,183
I'm gonna give you the number
of a very good lawyer.

392
00:32:53,303 --> 00:32:56,190
The best thing is to call him.

393
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,966
But Igor won't be able to.

394
00:32:59,835 --> 00:33:02,444
We didn't count on it.
We just came for no particular reason.

395
00:33:02,495 --> 00:33:04,721
- To reminisce about our good days.
- Well, that's fine.

396
00:33:04,772 --> 00:33:07,062
Let's have some tea.
Cakes, please.

397
00:33:07,182 --> 00:33:10,456
- Thank you. Ow!
- You're welcome.

398
00:33:10,918 --> 00:33:12,081
Thank you.

399
00:33:14,563 --> 00:33:16,136
Have you been called yet?

400
00:33:19,228 --> 00:33:20,603
No.

401
00:33:21,378 --> 00:33:24,296
Uh... what? Should they call?

402
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:28,406
Yeah, they should. They have to!

403
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:33,548
They can... imprison?

404
00:33:34,831 --> 00:33:36,144
I don't know.

405
00:33:38,002 --> 00:33:41,781
Albina!
Put on some music or something.

406
00:33:43,471 --> 00:33:46,561
Before she stepped off the curb,
did she look in my direction?

407
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:50,683
She turned her head, she looked,
and walked away.

408
00:33:50,803 --> 00:33:54,090
Looked and went.
It's all on the record.

409
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:57,418
I want to bring this to your attention.
I think it's a too important point.

410
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,221
Certainly important.

411
00:33:59,341 --> 00:34:01,475
I was looking, I could have seen it.
but I didn't.

412
00:34:01,595 --> 00:34:05,283
Oh, well... Looked and didn't see.
It's quite possible.

413
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,241
Do you agree?

414
00:34:08,361 --> 00:34:10,315
And I think you're excluding
that possibility.

415
00:34:10,435 --> 00:34:11,850
Or you just underestimate it.

416
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,903
Look, don't you think
that we're having a little bit of a...

417
00:34:15,101 --> 00:34:16,215
one-sided conversation.

418
00:34:16,265 --> 00:34:18,035
Who's interrogating who, you or me?

419
00:34:20,106 --> 00:34:21,741
You're right. I'm sorry.

420
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:23,922
And you don't have to worry so much.

421
00:34:24,674 --> 00:34:28,309
I'll try, but my position...
makes it natural.

422
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:31,906
Well, I guess so. All right!
And so we'll go on.

423
00:34:32,026 --> 00:34:34,545
- How fast were you going anyway?
- Average speed.

424
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:36,583
Answer, please, in detail.

425
00:34:36,703 --> 00:34:39,287
- What do you mean by average? Up to 60?
- Yes.

426
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,629
Are you stating that categorically?

427
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,711
Categorically.

428
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:48,317
Okay.

429
00:34:49,229 --> 00:34:51,291
Read it and sign it.

430
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:59,253
- So, that's it for today?
- Almost done.

431
00:35:00,194 --> 00:35:03,070
Now as for the victim.
Whether she saw it or not.

432
00:35:03,366 --> 00:35:05,417
- Let me have a smoke.
- Please.

433
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:08,646
It's quite possible that she
...didn't see your car.

434
00:35:08,766 --> 00:35:12,477
Because of low vision, lost
even maybe to a considerable degree.

435
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,837
But it's not confirmed yet.

436
00:35:16,175 --> 00:35:19,949
We've made inquiries to the clinic,
and there's no record.

437
00:35:20,491 --> 00:35:22,380
- There's nothing?
- No.

438
00:35:22,944 --> 00:35:25,422
But no one's going to
stop that.

439
00:35:26,016 --> 00:35:30,223
We call as witnesses relatives,
loved ones, those who lived nearby.

440
00:35:32,743 --> 00:35:35,799
Okay, I see, I see. Thank you

441
00:35:41,655 --> 00:35:45,604
But you do realize that it's like a bolt
from the blue.

442
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:48,888
I'm in misery.
In misfortune.

443
00:35:49,008 --> 00:35:51,134
But why me? I mean,
it could have happened to anybody.

444
00:35:51,184 --> 00:35:52,230
You know what I mean?

445
00:35:52,281 --> 00:35:54,068
Sidorov, Petrov, Ivanov.

446
00:35:54,188 --> 00:35:55,868
- Your husband after all.
- My husband?

447
00:35:55,947 --> 00:35:58,235
- But nobody's safe.
- Oh, no!

448
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,050
God forbid!

449
00:36:00,578 --> 00:36:04,186
He's a motorist, too.
We drive, too.

450
00:36:05,316 --> 00:36:07,076
You say you've been on the "Azerbaijan"?

451
00:36:07,196 --> 00:36:08,310
No, on the "Russia".

452
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,616
We were sailing on the "Abkhaz"
two years ago.

453
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:12,843
- But... Really...
- There, you see!

454
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:15,750
Swimmed, sunbathed,
and rode in a carriage in Batumi.

455
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:17,843
We were making plans,
and then all of a sudden.

456
00:36:17,894 --> 00:36:21,685
it's all gone, it's all gone to hell!
But in human terms, why?

457
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,593
Well, wait a minute.

458
00:36:24,132 --> 00:36:25,826
Everything is not lost.

459
00:36:26,104 --> 00:36:29,857
- Am I? You're reassuring me.
- Well, I don't know.

460
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,621
But at least it feels good,
that the sword is in your hands.

461
00:36:34,918 --> 00:36:36,273
What sword?

462
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,973
The one hanging over my head.
Damocles.

463
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:44,787
- Can I go now?
- Just a minute.

464
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:47,485
Kobozev, come in!

465
00:36:52,808 --> 00:36:54,051
Sit down.

466
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:58,916
- Hi.
- How do you do?

467
00:37:05,652 --> 00:37:07,792
All right! Witness Kobozev.

468
00:37:07,912 --> 00:37:12,666
As you have already shown, on April 26,
at approximately 7:10 p.m,

469
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:16,305
...you were traveling on the highway...
...in a Volga automobile.

470
00:37:16,356 --> 00:37:17,944
As you passed the intersection.

471
00:37:17,994 --> 00:37:20,207
Close to the lawn,
you bumped into a car...

472
00:37:20,258 --> 00:37:21,638
Well, how'd it go?

473
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:25,889
I thought we were...
we got an early start.

474
00:37:25,939 --> 00:37:27,989
Well, kind of a... competition.

475
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:31,402
First I got him, then he got me.

476
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:36,450
I have to say I got around him.
Caught him at the light.

477
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:39,183
All right! And what can you tell me
about the speed,

478
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:41,436
of the car in front of you -
"Zhiguli"?

479
00:37:43,442 --> 00:37:45,091
What can I say?

480
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:50,045
- The speed… was quite low.
- Yeah.

481
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:55,181
Well, it was... it was
about 70, at the most.

482
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,344
Mm-hmm.

483
00:37:56,499 --> 00:37:59,641
So it's about 70.
Approximately or exactly?

484
00:37:59,691 --> 00:38:00,721
Exactly.

485
00:38:01,494 --> 00:38:04,921
I followed him... ...in the lane,
I thought I'd go around.

486
00:38:05,681 --> 00:38:11,414
I'm looking at
the speedometer -- 65... 70.

487
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:15,345
Yes... 65-70. Exactly!

488
00:38:16,433 --> 00:38:17,636
Well, got carried away...

489
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:19,970
Look, I don't know
and I don't want to know

490
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:22,314
how they got carried away
and how they beat me.

491
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:23,901
That's right! And I forgot you.

492
00:38:24,021 --> 00:38:26,853
And please speak
in your own name - "got carried away."

493
00:38:26,973 --> 00:38:29,551
You, Vedeneevs sit down and
don't interrupt.

494
00:38:29,887 --> 00:38:31,672
And stop smoking!

495
00:38:31,885 --> 00:38:33,559
This is a confrontation,
not a youth cafe.

496
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,888
Sorry.

497
00:38:35,164 --> 00:38:37,937
Was it 65-70 at the
time of the accident, too?

498
00:38:37,988 --> 00:38:39,052
Of course.

499
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:41,464
Also...

500
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:45,503
I was like a shadow behind him.

501
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:48,841
And when he slowed down,
I almost ran into him.

502
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:50,079
I barely made it.

503
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,953
Okay. Do you have
any questions for the witness?

504
00:38:54,658 --> 00:38:57,994
No questions. I think we need to check
if the Volga's speedometer is correct.

505
00:38:58,045 --> 00:38:59,107
You check yours!

506
00:38:59,158 --> 00:39:01,406
- Yeah, okay.
- It's already been checked.

507
00:39:01,526 --> 00:39:03,994
The Volga's speedometer
and yours.

508
00:39:04,078 --> 00:39:05,512
- Yes?
- Yes.

509
00:39:05,632 --> 00:39:08,850
You are dismissed, Kobozev.
Read and sign.

510
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,956
You too, Vedenev.

511
00:39:16,012 --> 00:39:18,860
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

512
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,591
- Am I free?
- Just a minute.

513
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:26,916
Sign right here.

514
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,896
- I signed.
- No, not on the record.

515
00:39:30,357 --> 00:39:33,195
Please read this.
This is a no-exit pledge.

516
00:39:54,903 --> 00:39:56,368
- What?
- Here.

517
00:39:56,488 --> 00:39:58,549
- Well, all right. Go ahead.
- Signed.

518
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:00,483
Go.

519
00:40:11,982 --> 00:40:13,790
I'll give you a ride.

520
00:40:35,924 --> 00:40:39,417
Are you listening? Call me in about
ten minutes. Can I take a message?

521
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,913
Please.

522
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,473
Valera!

523
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,082
- Do you need a review?
- I do.

524
00:40:45,345 --> 00:40:47,082
Well, come on in, I wrote it.

525
00:40:54,111 --> 00:40:57,059
- Okay. Look at me.
- What?

526
00:40:58,041 --> 00:40:59,682
Nothing, let's go.

527
00:41:10,973 --> 00:41:12,289
- Hello.
- Hi.

528
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,319
Hello.

529
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:16,451
Could you please tell me if this is the
apartment of Anna Egorovna Koroleva?

530
00:41:16,502 --> 00:41:18,025
- Yes.
- May I come in?

531
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:19,412
Sure.

532
00:41:26,872 --> 00:41:28,418
Hang it right there.

533
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:34,100
Guests are here!

534
00:41:36,157 --> 00:41:39,037
Come on in, come on in.
Don't just stand there.

535
00:41:42,558 --> 00:41:44,876
- Hi, there.
- How do you do?

536
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:50,700
- There! Mother’s friends.
- Good evening.

537
00:41:51,701 --> 00:41:53,968
You're welcome. Have a seat.

538
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:55,881
Be seated.

539
00:41:56,401 --> 00:41:57,568
Thank you.

540
00:42:03,169 --> 00:42:04,600
Please be seated.

541
00:42:11,668 --> 00:42:13,174
Thank you, no.

542
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,513
The thing is...

543
00:42:18,841 --> 00:42:21,728
we're not acquaintances
of Anna Yegorovna.

544
00:42:23,186 --> 00:42:25,152
I thought you were acquaintances.

545
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:30,456
So... who are you, then?

546
00:42:31,439 --> 00:42:32,700
We are...

547
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:35,927
how can I tell you...

548
00:42:36,782 --> 00:42:38,621
This is my wife Natasha.

549
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,580
Well, I'm basically...

550
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:44,650
Well, the one...

551
00:42:46,136 --> 00:42:48,236
Well, the driver of the Zhiguli.

552
00:42:48,356 --> 00:42:50,099
The driver of the Zhiguli?

553
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:53,338
Well, yeah. The one who hit her.

554
00:43:07,227 --> 00:43:09,743
We're here to tell you...

555
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,607
to express our feelings.

556
00:43:13,986 --> 00:43:17,593
It wasn't easy for us to cross
the threshold of your house, but...

557
00:43:18,367 --> 00:43:21,860
- We felt it necessary...
- Hello.

558
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,350
Hello.

559
00:43:34,735 --> 00:43:39,709
We were wondering...
whether or not to go.

560
00:43:40,002 --> 00:43:43,870
We know the wound is still fresh and...

561
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:46,608
any other person...
in our place...

562
00:43:46,945 --> 00:43:49,045
Well, you know what I mean?

563
00:43:49,234 --> 00:43:52,502
We understand...
we understand that...

564
00:43:52,622 --> 00:43:55,831
you can't have
any good feelings for us,

565
00:43:57,164 --> 00:44:01,856
Still, it seemed to us that...
better if we....

566
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:07,701
together with you... try to resolve...
this situation.

567
00:44:08,692 --> 00:44:12,457
- Situation?
- Yes. The situation.

568
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,313
But I don't see any situation.

569
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:19,425
There was a woman and she's gone.
That's the situation.

570
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,305
But it's not that simple.

571
00:44:23,448 --> 00:44:25,444
You may be aware that there's an
investigation.

572
00:44:25,564 --> 00:44:27,636
And not all the matters are clear yet.

573
00:44:27,756 --> 00:44:29,461
Not all matters?

574
00:44:31,123 --> 00:44:34,689
- Yeah, not all of them.
- Which ones aren't clear, for example?

575
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,892
Well, it has to do with
Anna Yegorovna.

576
00:44:38,204 --> 00:44:39,425
I see.

577
00:44:40,693 --> 00:44:42,031
Interesting!

578
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:43,942
You know, it's very difficult
to talk...

579
00:44:44,594 --> 00:44:45,887
you could’ve understood us.

580
00:44:46,953 --> 00:44:48,858
But... this is primarily about...

581
00:44:48,908 --> 00:44:50,625
about establishing the truth.

582
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,941
And... you have to
understand us.

583
00:44:55,584 --> 00:44:58,496
There are questions that no one
can answer except...

584
00:44:58,616 --> 00:45:00,635
you, who knew her.

585
00:45:00,755 --> 00:45:02,328
Well, well, well.

586
00:45:05,033 --> 00:45:08,381
- How was her vision?
- Uh...

587
00:45:08,897 --> 00:45:10,204
Got it.

588
00:45:10,573 --> 00:45:15,012
You're interested in vision.
I mean, wasn't she blind?

589
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:16,443
No, she wasn't.

590
00:45:16,493 --> 00:45:19,634
But nobody's
talking about total blindness.

591
00:45:20,615 --> 00:45:24,318
I wonder where they're going with this,
these guests of ours?

592
00:45:24,438 --> 00:45:25,923
Oh, well, there you go.

593
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,838
She wasn't blind.
Is that okay with you?

594
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:32,706
Well, of course it isn't!
They want a blind one. Don't you get it?

595
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:37,900
I'm sorry, we didn't come here
to argue.

596
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,919
or to listen to your accusations.

597
00:45:40,162 --> 00:45:42,414
Although, I'm willing
to listen to anything,

598
00:45:42,717 --> 00:45:44,970
that I deserve from your side,

599
00:45:45,866 --> 00:45:47,439
please, if you must.

600
00:45:47,804 --> 00:45:51,596
Well, brothers,
you have nerves of steel.

601
00:45:51,978 --> 00:45:53,928
What makes you think that?

602
00:45:54,387 --> 00:45:57,209
Well, of course! A woman was murdered,

603
00:45:57,434 --> 00:46:00,533
and you go to find out
what kind of vision she had.

604
00:46:01,032 --> 00:46:04,642
And maybe you're also hoping to somehow
get out of it with our help.

605
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,215
Is that it?

606
00:46:07,019 --> 00:46:08,972
I didn’t murder.

607
00:46:10,799 --> 00:46:12,764
I'm not going to get out of it.

608
00:46:14,523 --> 00:46:19,080
Why are you here?
What exactly is your purpose?

609
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:22,682
Don’t do it!

610
00:46:38,322 --> 00:46:40,427
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

611
00:46:43,495 --> 00:46:44,788
Go that way.

612
00:46:47,529 --> 00:46:49,811
What's there to say, anyway?

613
00:46:50,414 --> 00:46:52,744
Her eyesight was bad.

614
00:46:57,415 --> 00:46:59,682
She didn't like to
go outside.

615
00:47:01,909 --> 00:47:05,159
- Just like that she felt.
- Ha-ha... felt!

616
00:47:05,674 --> 00:47:09,221
That he's sitting in his Zhiguli,
is this gorgeous young man right here,

617
00:47:10,275 --> 00:47:11,874
who one day,
you see,

618
00:47:11,924 --> 00:47:14,078
will fail to slow down in time.

619
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:16,569
You don't see a lot of old ladies
roaming the streets,

620
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:18,142
much less those with bad eyesight.

621
00:47:18,209 --> 00:47:20,873
They're just walking right up to him.
in front of his wheels.

622
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,157
- Do you have a car?
- We do! We have a car.

623
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:26,682
It's a good one! It's big!

624
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,840
It's called the Black Crow.
You've never ridden one?

625
00:47:30,929 --> 00:47:33,053
- You're very aggressive.
- Yes?

626
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:35,133
Maybe...

627
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:38,427
I'm gonna put your husband away!
You can count on it.

628
00:47:39,417 --> 00:47:40,863
What was that for?

629
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,706
That's for this!

630
00:47:44,505 --> 00:47:45,981
That you're getting too far apart.

631
00:47:46,101 --> 00:47:49,433
- Now, walk off with your feet.
- You shouldn't do that, Victor.

632
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:53,193
See, the man's worried.

633
00:47:54,474 --> 00:47:56,343
Why are you doing to him so much?

634
00:47:59,057 --> 00:48:01,477
Because I have a Zhiguli.

635
00:48:03,693 --> 00:48:05,155
No, that's not it.

636
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,917
It's because you don't know how
to drive a car,

637
00:48:08,131 --> 00:48:10,454
for the fact that you took
a woman's life,

638
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:13,388
and now here you are,
trying you're making it up to me.

639
00:48:13,966 --> 00:48:16,618
He'll get out of it.

640
00:48:16,914 --> 00:48:19,468
You'll get out of it, don't worry.

641
00:48:19,786 --> 00:48:23,855
Just don't come here again,
You won't get anything here.

642
00:48:24,807 --> 00:48:27,835
You're gonna get yourself in trouble
for trying to apply pressure.

643
00:48:28,668 --> 00:48:31,328
See how many witnesses
are here.

644
00:48:31,622 --> 00:48:32,669
I see.

645
00:48:33,184 --> 00:48:35,247
Well, if you do,
get the hell out of here.

646
00:48:36,086 --> 00:48:37,762
Roll away, roll away!

647
00:48:44,003 --> 00:48:45,342
Goodbye.

648
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,622
Goodbye.

649
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:08,590
- Well?
- Let's get out of here.

650
00:49:09,222 --> 00:49:10,432
You're right.

651
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:14,876
But I'm listening to
you. What's the news?

652
00:49:14,927 --> 00:49:16,063
No news.

653
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:18,764
Well, that's news.

654
00:49:19,043 --> 00:49:22,026
Apparently they weren't
very hospitable.

655
00:49:22,275 --> 00:49:24,577
It's only natural,
I warned you.

656
00:49:24,697 --> 00:49:26,298
Well, what's the point?

657
00:49:29,543 --> 00:49:32,798
As a lawyer, I need to know
if she was wearing glasses.

658
00:49:32,918 --> 00:49:36,602
I need her glasses right now,
during the indictment phase.

659
00:49:36,722 --> 00:49:38,287
No glasses.

660
00:49:39,218 --> 00:49:40,664
No way.

661
00:49:40,896 --> 00:49:44,021
Reading glasses, outdoor glasses.
Well, at least some glass.

662
00:49:45,158 --> 00:49:47,504
- This is your only chance.
- I understand.

663
00:49:47,913 --> 00:49:50,734
- What did they say?
- They didn't say anything.

664
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:52,152
Where should I drop you off?

665
00:49:52,272 --> 00:49:55,088
- No, we'll be fine. Thank you.
- Call.

666
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:57,523
- Aren't we going home?
- No.

667
00:49:57,843 --> 00:49:59,247
Have a good time!

668
00:50:09,521 --> 00:50:11,241
What's up? Where are we going?

669
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,072
Home.

670
00:50:30,116 --> 00:50:31,622
Are you smoking?

671
00:50:51,113 --> 00:50:52,623
Well, okay.

672
00:50:53,939 --> 00:50:55,990
What do you intend to do next?

673
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:12,073
I'm scared, Vitya.

674
00:51:13,063 --> 00:51:14,719
Really?

675
00:51:16,452 --> 00:51:19,474
- Yes?
- I'm suddenly scared now.

676
00:51:20,787 --> 00:51:22,612
We're lying here - you're with me.

677
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,233
And you're not with me anymore!

678
00:51:24,284 --> 00:51:26,558
- You left me and you're running away.
- What kind of nonsense is that?

679
00:51:26,608 --> 00:51:28,440
Alone, without me.
That's running away!

680
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:29,522
Yes, what nonsense.

681
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:33,160
- It's silly, isn't it?
- Of course it is.

682
00:51:34,353 --> 00:51:35,621
Go to sleep!

683
00:51:38,527 --> 00:51:39,828
Okay.

684
00:51:40,328 --> 00:51:42,547
Close your eyes and go to sleep.

685
00:51:47,757 --> 00:51:49,500
- You sleep, too.
- Uh-huh.

686
00:51:54,048 --> 00:51:58,388
<i>"I'll be late tonight.
Don't worry. Kisses, V."</i>

687
00:52:35,516 --> 00:52:37,753
Hold on. Hold on.

688
00:52:41,561 --> 00:52:44,684
Marusya! It's me, sorry.

689
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,637
There's a fellow here asking for you.

690
00:52:49,924 --> 00:52:53,222
- He says it's an urgent matter.
- Vitya!

691
00:52:59,653 --> 00:53:00,951
Vitya!

692
00:53:01,325 --> 00:53:03,519
- Hello, Vitya.
- Hello.

693
00:53:07,381 --> 00:53:09,279
Well, show yourself.

694
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:11,184
- How was your rest?
- I didn't get much rest.

695
00:53:11,234 --> 00:53:13,031
- Paul, did you feed him?
- I'm not hungry.

696
00:53:13,096 --> 00:53:14,414
I offered.

697
00:53:17,106 --> 00:53:19,401
- So, mom?
- Well, how did you two meet?

698
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,157
And I called
Pavel Dmitrievich at work.

699
00:53:21,207 --> 00:53:22,413
I wasn't expecting you at all.

700
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:23,680
Yes?

701
00:53:29,312 --> 00:53:31,553
Where? Where do you want to go?

702
00:53:33,196 --> 00:53:36,287
Mom, I'm going for a long trip.

703
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:41,285
Well, anyway...
Think of it as going abroad.

704
00:53:42,341 --> 00:53:45,551
I don't even know how often
I can write to you.

705
00:53:46,789 --> 00:53:50,451
Well, uh... anyway, I want you
to be ready.

706
00:53:52,575 --> 00:53:54,525
I understand.

707
00:53:57,366 --> 00:54:00,586
You're a family man.
I can tell it to you.

708
00:54:02,783 --> 00:54:05,705
Only when there was Anya,

709
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,430
maybe she wasn't so good,

710
00:54:09,569 --> 00:54:12,368
but you weren't eager to make money.

711
00:54:14,405 --> 00:54:16,213
It's not about the money, Mom.

712
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:20,424
How can I tell you?
It's a different kind of trip.

713
00:54:23,082 --> 00:54:25,114
You can't make much money there.

714
00:54:26,213 --> 00:54:29,241
Well, anyway... you'll eventually...
you'll figure it out.

715
00:54:33,783 --> 00:54:36,185
I don't want to get into your business,

716
00:54:36,903 --> 00:54:38,637
but you've changed, Vitya.

717
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:45,956
You don't come here that often.
and Pavel Dmitrievich and I can see that

718
00:54:48,751 --> 00:54:52,002
You must have grown up early,
that's what I think.

719
00:54:55,528 --> 00:54:58,167
Maybe it would have been better if

720
00:54:58,287 --> 00:55:02,168
your successes came to you later.
- Fifty years from now.

721
00:55:02,827 --> 00:55:05,184
It's okay, Mom.
It's all right.

722
00:55:05,859 --> 00:55:07,352
And Natasha...

723
00:55:09,216 --> 00:55:10,674
You don't know her very well,

724
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,833
but she's not
the kind of wife who rushes.

725
00:55:17,087 --> 00:55:19,589
Yeah, I don't know you much either.

726
00:56:37,715 --> 00:56:39,347
- Hello.
- Hello.

727
00:57:05,426 --> 00:57:07,804
You don't ask where I've been?

728
00:57:09,136 --> 00:57:11,545
I never ask,
if you can tell.

729
00:57:12,005 --> 00:57:13,351
Yep.

730
00:57:14,315 --> 00:57:16,719
- I went to see my mother.
- That's what I thought.

731
00:57:22,622 --> 00:57:24,018
Listen,

732
00:57:25,148 --> 00:57:27,189
I'll probably postpone the defense.

733
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,923
Is that her advice, your mother’s?

734
00:57:32,884 --> 00:57:34,311
What’s she got to do with it?

735
00:57:35,246 --> 00:57:36,720
These are my thoughts.

736
00:57:38,682 --> 00:57:41,053
I can see you're just so attracted
to prison bars.

737
00:57:43,082 --> 00:57:44,642
Well, what do you think?

738
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,138
I've got to payback.

739
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:51,990
Or shouldn't I?

740
00:57:52,487 --> 00:57:53,776
Pay up?

741
00:57:54,691 --> 00:57:55,846
For what?

742
00:57:57,781 --> 00:57:59,932
For the death of a woman.

743
00:58:00,378 --> 00:58:02,597
Um...

744
00:58:03,561 --> 00:58:05,849
That's where you're going.

745
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:18,145
Well, really, what she was like -
lame or blind,

746
00:58:20,049 --> 00:58:23,157
she still lived.
Right?

747
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,534
That's right!

748
00:58:26,417 --> 00:58:29,604
And now you want to sacrifice
your life and my life too.

749
00:58:30,777 --> 00:58:32,403
Why yours?

750
00:58:34,394 --> 00:58:37,644
That's right!
You're not counting me.

751
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:40,002
Natasha, really?

752
00:58:40,525 --> 00:58:43,885
All right, let's drink tea.
It's probably all boiled out by now.

753
00:59:30,224 --> 00:59:31,512
Vitya!

754
00:59:32,205 --> 00:59:34,509
There's one piece of news that
that changes everything.

755
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,506
One more?

756
00:59:38,521 --> 00:59:40,287
We're going to have a baby.

757
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:50,337
- Repeat.
- We're going to have a baby.

758
00:59:53,134 --> 00:59:54,576
When?

759
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,366
I don't know, you can count.

760
01:00:10,259 --> 01:00:11,823
Natasha!

761
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:38,057
Natasha, why are we walking?
Let me get the elevator.

762
01:00:38,177 --> 01:00:41,519
- Come on, silly, we're here.
- Oh, yeah.

763
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:50,296
- Hello there.
- How do you do?

764
01:00:50,416 --> 01:00:52,385
- Hello.
- That's us.

765
01:00:52,436 --> 01:00:53,806
There's no one in the apartment,

766
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,505
I'm waiting for the housing authority.

767
01:00:56,449 --> 01:00:58,957
- Come on in.
- Come on in.

768
01:01:04,515 --> 01:01:07,604
No, you did the right thing,
for coming in.

769
01:01:07,724 --> 01:01:10,181
Especially now in this
position.

770
01:01:10,301 --> 01:01:13,183
- Yes.
- All roads lead to you.

771
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:14,670
Yes, of course.

772
01:01:14,951 --> 01:01:18,882
Then it's a little awkward for us,
but you can understand us, too.

773
01:01:20,037 --> 01:01:24,151
And that's her, our
Anna Yegorovna.

774
01:01:29,667 --> 01:01:31,583
What a nice face. Isn't it?

775
01:01:32,971 --> 01:01:34,543
Is that...

776
01:01:34,837 --> 01:01:37,242
I'm going to show you
some other pictures.

777
01:01:38,048 --> 01:01:41,312
You see, that's her and her father.

778
01:01:42,314 --> 01:01:45,779
And this... That's the nurse of mercy.

779
01:01:45,899 --> 01:01:49,286
- Is that her?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. In the middle there.

780
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,681
And that's her and her friend.

781
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:57,258
- Is that before the war?
- Yes, yes, with a friend.

782
01:03:02,302 --> 01:03:04,650
- Give it to him.
- What?

783
01:03:05,653 --> 01:03:08,581
- A lighter? What does he need it for?
- Give it to him, give it to him.

784
01:03:10,802 --> 01:03:12,305
- You think?
- Yes.

785
01:03:12,425 --> 01:03:14,504
- It's a Ronson!
- That's okay, you'll get over it.

786
01:03:28,207 --> 01:03:29,380
Zina.

787
01:03:30,977 --> 01:03:32,490
You know what we mean.

788
01:03:35,692 --> 01:03:38,853
Do you understand why we have to
to come to you?

789
01:03:39,558 --> 01:03:41,379
To visit Anna Egorovna's relatives...?

790
01:03:42,874 --> 01:03:46,824
But here you have confirmed that she
couldn't see well. She wore glasses.

791
01:03:47,767 --> 01:03:50,296
- Is that right? Confirmed?
- Yes, yes.

792
01:03:50,962 --> 01:03:55,885
Here, but unfortunately in the clinic
that's not registered in any way.

793
01:03:56,811 --> 01:03:58,858
And here, if they could
help the investigation.

794
01:03:58,909 --> 01:04:01,029
The whole thing would have been
repeated at the trial.

795
01:04:03,729 --> 01:04:06,278
- In court...
- Yes, in court.

796
01:04:12,732 --> 01:04:14,119
Zinochka,

797
01:04:15,022 --> 01:04:18,281
understand me,
woman to woman.

798
01:04:20,088 --> 01:04:23,767
Oh... I understand, of course,
what you're thinking.

799
01:04:25,961 --> 01:04:29,375
I mean, that's not good at all,
but it has nothing to do with the baby.

800
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:33,636
Oh, if you'd just come right out

801
01:04:33,686 --> 01:04:35,790
just admit that you were pregnant.

802
01:04:38,423 --> 01:04:40,715
Oh, I don't know how to help you.

803
01:04:43,217 --> 01:04:44,291
Uh...

804
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:48,421
Why don't you talk to Kostik?
I have his address.

805
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:50,548
Kostik?

806
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:54,605
Do you think it makes sense?

807
01:04:54,725 --> 01:04:56,724
Well, he was the closest to her somehow.

808
01:04:56,774 --> 01:04:59,181
Anything happens,
she immediately calls Kostik.

809
01:04:59,789 --> 01:05:02,308
So I'll go get the address now, shall I?

810
01:05:03,846 --> 01:05:05,763
- Thank you, Zinochka.
- Uh-huh.

811
01:05:05,883 --> 01:05:07,214
You are very kind.

812
01:05:07,667 --> 01:05:10,747
And... we won't forget you, no.
And... I hope that you

813
01:05:10,867 --> 01:05:13,297
come and see us with your boy.
- Yes.

814
01:05:26,415 --> 01:05:28,450
- Good evening.
- Hello.

815
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:30,892
- Are you Kostantin Mikhalych Korolev?
- Yes, I am.

816
01:05:31,012 --> 01:05:32,830
My last name is Vedeneev.

817
01:05:33,411 --> 01:05:35,541
We're here to talk to you
about something...

818
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:43,301
Don't I get it?

819
01:05:46,912 --> 01:05:49,841
Her right eye was dead.

820
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:52,492
She kept turning sideways,

821
01:05:52,667 --> 01:05:53,919
like a chicken.

822
01:05:54,966 --> 01:05:57,676
She's got a left eye,
and she barely even looks at it.

823
01:05:58,947 --> 01:06:00,955
You should put her glasses on...

824
01:06:01,777 --> 01:06:03,532
Scary stuff!

825
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:07,761
I tried it once
and almost went blind myself.

826
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:14,178
- Cheers.
- Cheers. Cheers!

827
01:06:14,229 --> 01:06:16,289
Uh... Vitya!
That's not the way to do it.

828
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:17,009
What?

829
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:19,787
- You leave something in the shot glass.
- Vitya!

830
01:06:19,907 --> 01:06:21,306
That's it!

831
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:27,899
Cheers!

832
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:40,416
Why aren't we dancing, huh?

833
01:06:41,484 --> 01:06:45,824
Vitya! May I invite your
spouse? Do I have the right?

834
01:06:45,944 --> 01:06:48,911
- Sure, what are we talking about.
- Well, absolutely... later.

835
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:53,055
Have something to eat now.
Here, let me get you a salad.

836
01:06:53,268 --> 01:06:56,825
- Have some fish then.
- Go ahead.

837
01:06:56,945 --> 01:06:58,696
Konstantin Mikhalych,
you don't eat.

838
01:06:58,816 --> 01:06:59,835
Me?

839
01:07:00,348 --> 01:07:01,908
I'm eating.

840
01:07:02,503 --> 01:07:06,343
- You're the one who's watching.
- Well, of course.

841
01:07:06,614 --> 01:07:07,994
We eat.

842
01:07:21,793 --> 01:07:23,617
Would you be so kind
as to have one more?

843
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:27,053
I'm the one who's going to burst.

844
01:07:27,801 --> 01:07:30,470
I'm gonna eat it all up and burst!

845
01:07:32,638 --> 01:07:34,898
Konstantin... Mikhalych...

846
01:07:39,629 --> 01:07:41,695
Feed, feed...

847
01:07:44,689 --> 01:07:48,519
I'll do it the other way around... huh?

848
01:07:50,841 --> 01:07:52,043
What do you mean?

849
01:07:52,163 --> 01:07:54,823
But that doesn't sound like you,
Konstantin Mikhalych.

850
01:07:54,996 --> 01:07:56,515
You know...

851
01:07:57,494 --> 01:07:59,677
Looks like it, doesn't look like it...

852
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:06,237
No glasses there.

853
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:11,321
Vision is bad.
So?

854
01:08:14,008 --> 01:08:17,527
And you're gonna have to, Vitya,
gnaw into the permafrost.

855
01:08:18,173 --> 01:08:20,784
It’s impossible, can't stop you.

856
01:08:20,904 --> 01:08:23,704
Steam is blowing,
salty icicles are hanging.

857
01:08:24,824 --> 01:08:26,808
It's beautiful!

858
01:08:31,642 --> 01:08:34,613
It’s a joke! Joke!

859
01:08:38,294 --> 01:08:40,231
What are you afraid of?

860
01:08:43,485 --> 01:08:45,684
Look at his face,
it's all stretched out.

861
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:52,665
Yeah, don't be afraid, Vitya.
Don't be afraid!

862
01:08:53,343 --> 01:08:56,170
Let's do it! What are you talking about!

863
01:09:10,776 --> 01:09:11,908
Uh...

864
01:09:13,845 --> 01:09:17,808
If only... my lover...
was here

865
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:19,697
- Do you mind?
- Do you mind? Of course!

866
01:09:19,748 --> 01:09:21,458
Well, of course,
what are you talking about.

867
01:09:21,508 --> 01:09:23,224
Or you'll come home:

868
01:09:23,344 --> 01:09:26,171
"Who have you been with?
Where have you been?"

869
01:09:26,673 --> 01:09:29,809
This seems like a good time.

870
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:33,114
We'll call you in a minute.

871
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:36,699
Just like that, you in your voice.

872
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:38,867
Well, it's more civilized that way!

873
01:09:38,918 --> 01:09:40,711
- You're on your own!
- Oh, for God's sake.

874
01:09:40,923 --> 01:09:43,044
- Two pennies...
- Here! Go ahead.

875
01:09:49,009 --> 01:09:50,345
Vitya!

876
01:09:50,826 --> 01:09:53,511
- Where are you going?
- That way.

877
01:09:54,196 --> 01:09:56,163
And the phone?

878
01:10:02,045 --> 01:10:06,350
261-35-34

879
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:10,480
261-35-34 now.

880
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:32,934
So...white dance?

881
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:04,717
- Well, you're good!
- What's wrong with you?

882
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:07,592
You made that up really well.

883
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:10,498
What are you laughing about?

884
01:13:11,129 --> 01:13:13,376
Isn't it bad for you to dance?

885
01:13:13,496 --> 01:13:16,388
Yeah, don't be jealous! Because I...

886
01:13:17,747 --> 01:13:19,663
Don't be jealous!

887
01:13:20,902 --> 01:13:24,600
No, I said, isn't it bad for you?

888
01:13:25,492 --> 01:13:26,681
What?

889
01:13:28,465 --> 01:13:30,051
Well, to jump?

890
01:13:30,785 --> 01:13:33,635
Isn't it bad in your state?

891
01:13:34,826 --> 01:13:36,461
Not really.

892
01:13:43,193 --> 01:13:45,419
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Come on, Kostik!

893
01:13:45,539 --> 01:13:47,050
Come on!

894
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,946
Vitek...

895
01:14:02,676 --> 01:14:04,121
That's sad.

896
01:14:08,666 --> 01:14:11,288
Ride! Everything! Chief, that's it!

897
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:03,952
Did you go to bed yet?

898
01:15:19,697 --> 01:15:21,955
This is a nightmare.

899
01:15:26,924 --> 01:15:28,570
I think...

900
01:15:29,939 --> 01:15:32,753
I'm sorry, but it's better if you

901
01:15:33,656 --> 01:15:34,972
were put in jail.

902
01:15:37,786 --> 01:15:40,935
That would have been better
for both of us.

903
01:15:42,745 --> 01:15:45,017
That's right.

904
01:15:53,618 --> 01:15:58,623
Ouch... You need to see a doctor.

905
01:15:58,937 --> 01:16:02,592
Or else you'll have a baby
with a handicap.

906
01:16:02,936 --> 01:16:05,186
Some kind of a flawed child.

907
01:16:06,694 --> 01:16:08,098
What?

908
01:16:10,142 --> 01:16:11,794
Nothing.

909
01:16:15,194 --> 01:16:17,016
Go to sleep.

910
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:20,778
Turn off the light.

911
01:17:14,739 --> 01:17:17,813
Well, all right! You have a reason
to hate me, let's say.

912
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:21,547
Well, you tell me. Well, how could I
make you feel better

913
01:17:21,858 --> 01:17:24,250
I lied about a baby.
It's embarrassing, I know.

914
01:17:24,370 --> 01:17:27,052
Well, there's got to be a way
to get out of this dead state.

915
01:17:27,379 --> 01:17:29,490
Well, what'd you do? You're going to
jail? Yes.

916
01:17:29,816 --> 01:17:31,921
Well, say something!
Come on, don't be silent!

917
01:17:32,041 --> 01:17:33,341
All right!

918
01:17:33,937 --> 01:17:35,300
What's good?

919
01:17:37,224 --> 01:17:39,034
I love you so much.

920
01:17:40,323 --> 01:17:42,266
I love you so much, silly.

921
01:17:42,966 --> 01:17:44,962
This is all because of you!

922
01:17:47,354 --> 01:17:49,594
Don't just lie there like a stone.
Give me a hug.

923
01:17:52,837 --> 01:17:54,026
No.

924
01:17:55,265 --> 01:17:56,868
Sleep, sleep.

925
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:41,680
- Well, I'm asking you.
- No promises, I'm a superstitious man.

926
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,034
- Well, I'll be counting.
- We'll count together.

927
01:18:44,154 --> 01:18:45,765
- Still waiting?
- It's okay.

928
01:18:45,885 --> 01:18:48,416
You promised at 4:00,
but... I came earlier.

929
01:18:48,467 --> 01:18:50,261
I promised at 4:00,
I'll meet you at 4:00.

930
01:18:50,312 --> 01:18:52,882
I have some serious news
for you. Do you know?

931
01:18:55,151 --> 01:18:57,031
- You're not listening to me.
- Yes, I am.

932
01:18:57,151 --> 01:18:59,233
I'm listening, it's just that
every day is news.

933
01:18:59,353 --> 01:19:01,539
The victim's glasses
are being disclosed.

934
01:19:01,659 --> 01:19:04,750
- What?
- I said, the victim's glasses.

935
01:19:05,033 --> 01:19:07,885
that's exactly what it says
about her eyesight. Let's go.

936
01:19:15,753 --> 01:19:17,704
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

937
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,058
Please be seated.

938
01:19:25,554 --> 01:19:29,374
- I don't see a reaction on your face.
- Yes, there is a reaction.

939
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,031
Where can I take you?

940
01:19:32,349 --> 01:19:35,776
Straight ahead, please.
To the Kievsky railway station.

941
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:58,270
My father was a chauffeur.

942
01:19:58,826 --> 01:20:02,213
Died in the fiftieth.
He was badly wounded.

943
01:20:02,507 --> 01:20:04,509
Well, what about your grandfather?

944
01:20:04,559 --> 01:20:07,293
Well, grandfather.
A Kuban Cossack, an Ataman.

945
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:10,287
A nasty piece of work.
Scar across his face.

946
01:20:10,337 --> 01:20:12,331
Yes, interesting, interesting.

947
01:20:13,184 --> 01:20:17,351
Well, well, Victor, I'm glad you've
come to see me.

948
01:20:18,826 --> 01:20:20,819
Congratulations again!

949
01:20:20,939 --> 01:20:24,845
- Your thesis is wonderful.
- Thank you, Andrey Vasilich.

950
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:30,955
We’ll move it, print it and so on.

951
01:20:31,075 --> 01:20:32,292
Thank you.

952
01:20:32,772 --> 01:20:34,956
You've got there,
honestly, some stupid expressions

953
01:20:35,076 --> 01:20:38,377
I underlined it. Check and correct.
- OK.

954
01:20:38,497 --> 01:20:43,357
By the way, there are much
fewer smart people than we imagine.

955
01:20:44,084 --> 01:20:46,925
And even more independent and brave.

956
01:20:47,206 --> 01:20:48,953
Well, now that's it!

957
01:20:50,043 --> 01:20:53,637
Now my granddaughter Katya
will give you tea.

958
01:20:53,757 --> 01:20:55,464
Godspeed, and let me rest.

959
01:20:56,076 --> 01:20:58,226
- Katya!
- Andrey Vasilich!

960
01:20:58,459 --> 01:21:01,978
I would like to ask you to
postpone my legal defense.

961
01:21:02,206 --> 01:21:04,951
Postpone it? Why?

962
01:21:05,492 --> 01:21:07,910
- Has something happened?
- Yes.

963
01:21:09,754 --> 01:21:11,860
I'm going to jail.

964
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:16,269
- What's this nonsense?
- Truly nonsense.

965
01:21:17,241 --> 01:21:21,156
I hit a woman. The woman died.

966
01:21:21,568 --> 01:21:25,878
Old woman died, I exceeded
speed, I will be trialed...

967
01:21:27,467 --> 01:21:29,131
Well, in general...

968
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:32,730
So...

969
01:21:33,354 --> 01:21:35,700
Well, we must do something, right?

970
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:37,995
After all, something is done
in such cases?

971
01:21:38,785 --> 01:21:40,509
We did everything that is...

972
01:21:40,976 --> 01:21:43,015
is usually done in such cases.

973
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,554
And... What?

974
01:21:50,011 --> 01:21:52,297
Of course, I understand
this is a serious matter,

975
01:21:52,347 --> 01:21:54,301
but don't go to jail now
because of this.

976
01:21:54,468 --> 01:21:57,392
- It's funny and sad.
- Funny and sad.

977
01:21:58,013 --> 01:21:59,725
But that's how it turned out.

978
01:22:01,427 --> 01:22:03,000
Turned out...

979
01:22:03,545 --> 01:22:05,092
And it seems to me,

980
01:22:05,701 --> 01:22:07,616
that there is no need
to run away from this.

981
01:22:08,557 --> 01:22:10,241
It is better to not try to escape.

982
01:22:12,004 --> 01:22:13,367
What's this nonsense?

983
01:22:14,251 --> 01:22:16,798
Are you tired, Victor?
What's wrong with you?

984
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:22,480
I’m tired.

985
01:22:26,851 --> 01:22:28,309
And are you...

986
01:22:28,702 --> 01:22:30,670
really going to prison?

987
01:22:42,677 --> 01:22:45,841
Well, maybe I could do
something for you? Tell me.

988
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,055
No! No, no, no.

989
01:22:48,831 --> 01:22:50,084
No.

990
01:22:52,907 --> 01:22:55,342
Look how desperate he is.

991
01:22:55,731 --> 01:22:58,471
Your Cossack Ataman
has spoken within you.

992
01:23:01,704 --> 01:23:03,511
Yes, except that...

993
01:23:08,173 --> 01:23:10,009
And how long are you going to leave?

994
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:13,942
I don't know, I think... no...

995
01:23:14,902 --> 01:23:16,249
Not really.

996
01:23:23,706 --> 01:23:26,222
I have nothing to tell you, Victor.

997
01:23:27,372 --> 01:23:30,899
- And yet, I wish you...
- Thank you.

998
01:23:32,246 --> 01:23:34,228
And who plays this, you?

999
01:23:35,737 --> 01:23:36,956
My granddaughter Katya.

1000
01:23:37,006 --> 01:23:39,591
Can we invite her here,
your granddaughter Katya?

1001
01:23:39,761 --> 01:23:40,934
For what?

1002
01:23:41,054 --> 01:23:42,171
Do you want to play?

1003
01:23:42,221 --> 01:23:44,448
Well, if you don't mind,
instead of tea.

1004
01:23:44,865 --> 01:23:47,623
Please come here. Katya!

1005
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:09,295
Natasha, we don't need so many things.

1006
01:25:34,248 --> 01:25:36,384
Oh. OK!

1007
01:25:44,699 --> 01:25:46,571
A lot, Natashka.

1008
01:25:46,691 --> 01:25:50,141
They're handkerchiefs, or do
you think you don't need them there?

1009
01:25:50,727 --> 01:25:52,313
OK, well.

1010
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:54,585
I'll put the old ones in.

1011
01:25:55,071 --> 01:25:56,607
Well.

1012
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:09,754
And why did you take this? Calzones!
Where did you find it?

1013
01:26:11,229 --> 01:26:14,941
- But these are yours.
- I've never worn them in my life.

1014
01:26:27,858 --> 01:26:29,570
Well, that won't do.

1015
01:26:30,376 --> 01:26:31,894
Shirt?

1016
01:26:33,691 --> 01:26:35,303
Too colourful!

1017
01:26:37,733 --> 01:26:39,499
I wore it on vacation.

1018
01:26:48,746 --> 01:26:50,754
Vitya, but they are all colourful.

1019
01:26:52,142 --> 01:26:54,125
Natasha, maybe a sweater?

1020
01:26:55,389 --> 01:26:57,893
Which one is this?
The old one with the deers on it?

1021
01:26:58,814 --> 01:27:00,782
Well, with deers,
probably not necessary?

1022
01:27:01,492 --> 01:27:04,568
But however, maybe
a sweater with deers will just fit.

1023
01:27:07,815 --> 01:27:09,374
Are you having fun?

1024
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:12,727
Is it really
«weight off your mind» for you?

1025
01:28:45,390 --> 01:28:48,183
As established by the court, the
citizen Koroleva...

1026
01:28:48,303 --> 01:28:52,799
violated articles 16, 18 and 20
of the traffic laws,

1027
01:28:52,919 --> 01:28:56,821
in result he caused an
emergency situation.

1028
01:28:57,121 --> 01:28:58,583
The defendant Vedeneev,

1029
01:28:58,703 --> 01:29:01,738
was driving at a speed of 65 kilometers
per hour, that is,

1030
01:29:01,858 --> 01:29:07,259
he exceeded the established article 74
speed rules of the road.

1031
01:29:07,516 --> 01:29:10,108
However, at the hearing,
the expert came to the conclusion that

1032
01:29:10,166 --> 01:29:12,506
if Vedeneev was driving
at a speed of even less

1033
01:29:12,626 --> 01:29:14,890
than 60 kilometers per hour

1034
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:18,364
he still would not have had
the technical ability to prevent

1035
01:29:18,484 --> 01:29:20,324
a collision with the citizen Koroleva.

1036
01:29:20,444 --> 01:29:23,355
In this connection,
the court does not find

1037
01:29:23,475 --> 01:29:25,782
a causal connection between
his actions

1038
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:28,368
and the severe
