1
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,240
The Last Bath

2
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,400
Oh girl Rita? What are you
doing up here? Go downstairs!

3
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,479
Sorry, sister.

4
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,800
Glad I see you! I already left you
the flowers there. Everything is there.

5
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,479
- Is everything on the altar?
- Yes yes, I left it as you asked.

6
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,960
So girls... Go! To have lunch.

7
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,280
The van is not supposed to be
waiting for you, like yesterday.

8
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,639
Andor!

9
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,840
Girl, you've been here for half an hour.

10
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,400
Come on. Hurry up.

11
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,159
Wherever I do it.

12
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,639
go down there

13
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,199
and in front of the altar you already
have everything to make the arrangement.

14
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:58,639
And it is: one, three, five. And those
little leaves all around the vase.

15
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,159
- One, three, five...
- One, three, five...

16
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,719
And make it quick so we
can go to lunch, It's okay?

17
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,560
It's okay.

18
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,280
Sister Josephine, you have a call.

19
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,280
It must be Lourdes. Tell
him I'll call him back, okay?

20
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,400
It's not Lourdes, it's from outside.

21
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,879
- It's okay.
- See you then.

22
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,120
See you soon.

23
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,280
Look, unfortunately I
don't bring you good news.

24
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,439
Yea?

25
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,120
Your dad was sick for some time, and...

26
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,800
Look, Josefina,

27
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,560
your daddy passed away today.

28
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,360
- It was his nephew,
Alexandre, who found him in bed.

29
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,599
Father Manuel has already
taken care of everything.

30
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,039
The funeral will be tomorrow.

31
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,159
Yes.

32
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,039
Alexandre is here with me.

33
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,879
He can't be alone in that house, can he?

34
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Poor little thing...

35
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,560
He turned fifteen last week...

36
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,840
He's still very cute.

37
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,399
It is my sister?

38
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,240
Angela? No one has yet talk to her.

39
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,399
friends and companions
flee from my disgrace.

40
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,600
My relatives are far away.

41
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,839
Those who seek to take
my life they set up traps.

42
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,759
My God, acknowledge my guilt.

43
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,560
Do not abandon me, Lord my salvation.

44
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,879
God our Father,

45
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,800
you rightly condemned sinful
man and you promised her life

46
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,639
by penance and the final resurrection;

47
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,720
we humbly beg you to
deign to bless this grave

48
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,160
while your servant's body
descends to the earth,

49
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,519
receive his soul in
Heaven, by Christ our Lord.

50
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,800
Amen.

51
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,279
Almighty God wanted to
call our brother to himself

52
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,600
whose body we delivered to the earth

53
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:10,201
to return to the place from
which it was taken...

54
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,360
Receive your soul and take it
to the presence of the Lord.

55
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,480
Oh son then?

56
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,480
So go.

57
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,040
Don't look like that, boy.

58
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,960
Go...

59
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,320
You will see that
everything will be fine.

60
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,120
Look that still tonight you'll sleep
in your bed, in your little room.

61
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,519
And look what your aunt will
take very good account of you.

62
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,600
My mother hasn't arrived yet...

63
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,879
Have you been able
to talk to Angela yet?

64
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,220
Do not.

65
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:14,960
He's got that idea she comes from.

66
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,919
The last time she came here,

67
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,559
look, it was at the festivities
of Our Lady of the Agony,

68
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,000
four years ago.

69
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,679
She appeared there with a man,

70
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,120
it's not even known if he was a
boyfriend, if he was a husband.

71
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,919
But since she fell out with her father,

72
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:36,320
she never set foot here again.

73
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,919
Can I?

74
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,279
Do you have a little bit of chamomile tea
there with some cookies to eat something.

75
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,000
You've been rolling
up all dinner. Come on.

76
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,600
You have to eat.

77
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,679
You have to help the aunt. Come on.

78
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,799
Adelaide spoke to your teacher and you
don't have to go to school tomorrow.

79
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,600
Eat a little more, Alexandre.

80
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,919
Alexandre, eat a little more...

81
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,399
I am not hungry.

82
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,720
You shouldn't walk around barefoot.

83
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,679
The slippers broke when I fell.

84
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,399
Excuse.

85
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Turn, turn, turn, turn.

86
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,399
Get up here.

87
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,159
- Do you want the blanket?
- No.

88
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,080
It's here folded at the bottom of the
bed, in case you get cold at night.

89
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,840
See you tomorrow.

90
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:50,799
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

91
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,519
I'm from social security, and
I come to talk about Alexandre.

92
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:57,039
Allow me to offer you my condolences.

93
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,999
I have some documents here, Dona Josefina,

94
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,600
and I would like you to read
them very carefully.

95
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:13,240
Our great concern, Dona Josefina,

96
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:16,559
it really is Alexandre's well-being.

97
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,759
If he doesn't have anyone
to take care of him,

98
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,160
he will have to go
to a reception center.

99
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,599
But I would like you to
reconsider this possibility.

100
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,519
I can't imagine myself
to come back here.

101
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,279
But it doesn't have to be here.

102
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,880
- It might be...
- Yes Yes. I understand, but...

103
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,839
I don't know if Father
Manuel explained it to you,

104
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,720
Yes.

105
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,960
Okay, I have the congregation...

106
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:01,599
- Yeah, he told me.
- and it would be very complicated,

107
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,119
because I'm a few months away
from taking perpetual vows

108
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,200
and suddenly this is a...

109
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:12,319
- I understand.
- it's a twist a little too big.

110
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,559
But of course I understand
that he doesn't...

111
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,759
- It's just that Alexandre can't stay alone.
- He can't stay.

112
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,279
He can not.

113
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,079
Unfortunately

114
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,200
or luckily it's my daily
life in the congregation.

115
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:32,519
Because we also have an institution
of girls who come by court order.

116
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:37,519
And so I know these processes.

117
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,720
But right now...

118
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,440
I think I need to fit.

119
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,519
Because Dona Josefina
would assume parental power.

120
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,160
- Perental.
- Exactly.

121
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,960
I thought you were in your room.

122
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,240
Sometimes it's important
to let off steam.

123
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:24,920
If you want to talk...

124
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:30,400
Today when I came home,

125
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,000
I... I passed Alice.

126
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,599
She was here, wasn't she?

127
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,039
She was.

128
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,240
Alice was here because she
she's worried about you.

129
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,559
I'm going to the orphanage, right?

130
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:56,480
We'll talk about it later. Now,

131
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,440
when you get home in this state the first
thing all you have to do is go to the bath.

132
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:02,799
Come on.

133
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,519
Go there.

134
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,240
how long have you don't
you shower, Alexandre?

135
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,039
I do not know.

136
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:19,119
- huh?
- I do not know.

137
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,000
Don't you know?

138
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,640
So why don't you shower?

139
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,440
- Because of the hand.
- Because of the hand?

140
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,599
And you are going to walk pig
while you have your hand like that.

141
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:30,440
It doesn't matter.

142
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,160
Yes, ma'am. Then?

143
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,359
Put a plastic bag in your
hand, that's no problem.

144
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,119
Oh! Get out there!

145
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,119
But aunt, I'm cold.

146
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,119
You're cold, nothing. You have
to stay a little longer like this.

147
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:58,559
Which is to make sure it all dies.

148
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:08,200
She lifts her head up, because it
still gets in your eyes, come on.

149
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,440
Ready. let yourself be
like this a little more.

150
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:16,119
It doesn't hurt anyone.

151
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,599
You're going out on this one.

152
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,039
Treat Adelaide well that she
has been a great friend of yours.

153
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,119
I come tonight.

154
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,960
See you later.

155
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,920
We don't live alone in the world.

156
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,680
sometimes before we think in our person

157
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:39,559
we have to think about others.

158
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,799
It cost you something to go to
Adelaide's house, have warned her?

159
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,119
Do not.

160
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,160
No?

161
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:55,160
Do you have something to tell me?

162
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,400
Sorry, aunt.

163
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,960
Let's go to sleep?

164
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:13,519
See you tomorrow.

165
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,759
Alexander.

166
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,000
Then?

167
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,920
What's up?

168
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,759
I can't sleep, auntie.

169
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,640
What time is it?

170
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,480
It's half past three.

171
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,680
Go to your bed, go.

172
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:08,160
It's just that I had a
nightmare about the grandfather.

173
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,319
Go have a glass of water.

174
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,240
And then you go back to bed.

175
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,960
But...

176
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,559
I wet the bed, auntie.

177
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,319
So go...

178
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,400
Let's go to sleep.

179
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,839
See you tomorrow.

180
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:38,920
Aunt.

181
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,599
When are we going to Porto?

182
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:44,599
When you behave yourself.

183
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,359
I really wanted to go back there.

184
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:52,519
I only went there once with the
grandfather. We went to see the dragon game.

185
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:56,720
The mother was with us too
only she didn't get to enter.

186
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,720
Did she do like her aunt?
She went to live in Porto...

187
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,920
You are boring today.

188
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:20,640
But I'm sure she
doesn't like me anymore.

189
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,000
Of course she likes it.

190
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,839
And will the aunt abandon me too?
Will she also return to Porto?

191
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,279
But who was here to take care
of everything? Was it you?

192
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,359
Yes. I can take care of the house, then!

193
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,680
It would also be cool to live alone.

194
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,960
Is there? Don't you need me?

195
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,599
Do not.

196
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
No?

197
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,279
So you want to come here
and wash your clothes?

198
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,119
Oh aunt...

199
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,759
does the aunt know my father?

200
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:12,640
Do not.

201
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,279
Grandfather and mother
never said anything to you?

202
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:21,240
I was never told anything either.

203
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,160
Was he from here?

204
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,680
If I told you I don't know who it is,

205
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:31,319
how do you want me to know
whether he was from here or not?

206
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,960
Where are you looking at?

207
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:14,519
- Shut up!
- You're looking at Sandra's tits.

208
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:17,079
I'll soon show you
some scenes on the net.

209
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,240
Look, do you want to go to my
house and play console soon?

210
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:21,799
Ya, it could be...

211
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,200
But then lend me your cell
phone for me to talk to my aunt?

212
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,039
Bruno, Alexandre!

213
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,640
Shall we stop whispering?

214
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,359
My God, why are you so good?

215
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,839
If you trusted me with my nephew...

216
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:10,000
if this is what you want from me...

217
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:12,200
give me a signal.

218
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,720
Help me know what to do.

219
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,319
Didn't you wash your hair?

220
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,720
No, I'll have to wash it
with that crap in eight days.

221
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,680
It's okay. But in the meantime
you can wash with normal shampoo.

222
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,000
Look there, is that a bath?

223
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,559
What is this here?

224
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
- I don't know, it shouldn't have left.
- Everything dirty.

225
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,240
Bath!

226
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,599
There...

227
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,720
What is it?

228
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,839
Nothing.

229
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:22,559
There.

230
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,480
Sorry, you're gonna have
to tell me what that is.

231
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,400
It hurts me here.

232
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,039
It's a little red and it hurts.

233
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,039
Show there.

234
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,680
Come on.

235
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,319
No, let it be.

236
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,039
What you have everyone
has. It's all in this world.

237
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:47,960
You got it all on fire.

238
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:51,759
try washing there and pull it back.

239
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,519
I am unable.

240
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:04,240
- Can not do it?
- No... It hurts me.

241
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,840
So we have to go to the doctor
to see what you have there.

242
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,239
You may need a circumcision
or that it's just inflamed.

243
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,639
I do not know. Turn around there.

244
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,760
Ready.

245
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:24,840
Now...

246
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:27,159
Be careful it will come out hot.

247
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,039
Give here.

248
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,199
Comes here.

249
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,480
Ready. I'll enjoy it and make dinner.

250
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:45,280
And hurry up, okay?

251
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,880
I thank you Lord.

252
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:16,000
because being angry with me

253
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:20,719
Your anger was appeased
and you consoled me.

254
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:26,599
God is my savior. I have
confidence and I fear nothing.

255
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,320
The Lord is my strength and my praise.

256
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:50,960
You can come now.

257
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,880
Good Morning.

258
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,320
Beware that I'm going
to open the window.

259
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,519
Then?

260
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,360
Did you get to sleep?

261
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,400
Didn't you have pain?

262
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,079
No. It doesn't hurt anymore.

263
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:58,280
Orange juice...

264
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,119
The aunt has to go to Porto
tomorrow. If you want to come with me?

265
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,599
- I can go?
- You can.

266
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,079
So I do.

267
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,119
Aunt, can we go to Dragon Stadium?

268
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:15,199
That's the hardest thing.

269
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,079
I do not know.

270
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,360
I don't know if we have time.

271
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,519
Give here.

272
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:31,599
I know you were very brave.

273
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:44,159
When I opened my lip it was
ten. Ten people grabbed me.

274
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,719
Show. Well, I noticed
that you have a scar here.

275
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,280
This time it was only three.

276
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,320
When you were born you had
the infirmary all around you.

277
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,559
Because?

278
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,039
Because a child hasn't been born for a
long time and you were like a kind of...

279
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,519
Ah, yes it was. The grandfather
even told me this story.

280
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,880
Look, this is the Church
of Santo Ildefonso.

281
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,000
It's on the Battlefield.

282
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,760
And this is the street I told you about.

283
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,559
Look at the tram.

284
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:52,320
Let's walk?

285
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,880
- No, we don't have time.
- Oh, okay.

286
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:01,079
The city of Porto was not
like that for some time.

287
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:03,480
- Yeah, I guess.
- With so many people.

288
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,960
Aunt, aunt, aunt! Buy me these sneakers?

289
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:11,840
- Come on. Go...
- Aunt! Please!

290
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,039
We've already taken such a long tour.

291
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:15,679
- O aunt, look here!
- I have to go now. Come on.

292
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,320
40% off, aunt!

293
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,760
You don't need sneakers. You've
stopped in stores three times.

294
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,320
Yes, I need to go there! Please aunt.

295
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,880
God bless you. See you soon.

296
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,079
I miss you so much, sister.
I need your help so much.

297
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,360
I know.

298
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,920
the death of your father it
must have shaken you a lot.

299
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,159
And now there is this child.

300
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:50,519
But be strong and pray a lot so
that God illuminates your life.

301
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:55,360
I would be unable to leave my nephew.

302
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,199
There are many ways to love God.

303
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,079
Devotion to others, charity

304
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:05,639
are other ways of us relate to God.

305
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,719
You are my family.

306
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,400
Josefina, we love you a lot.

307
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,239
But you have to go on with your
life spiritual wherever you are.

308
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,239
You can always count on us.

309
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,760
Thanks sister.

310
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:22,559
Four.

311
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,199
Five.

312
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,920
See you tomorrow.

313
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,360
Aunt.

314
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,239
can you pet me just until I fall asleep?

315
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:58,519
Give it a way, go.

316
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,480
You only put it on
again tomorrow morning.

317
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:24,440
Then there are no more drops.

318
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:27,599
You don't feel those little
bites anymore, may I help?

319
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:29,679
No, aunt. But now don't talk...

320
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,480
You're so spoiled.

321
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:24,679
Oh aunt, don't dry my hair
too much. To be sexier.

322
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:26,400
- To stay longer what?
- Sexy.

323
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,159
That's what Claudia said.

324
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,199
Who is Claudia?

325
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:32,840
A friend of mine.

326
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,079
Sit there and I'll cut you
a little bit of that hair.

327
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,199
She puts her head back.

328
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,280
Look at me.

329
00:46:09,639 --> 00:46:12,719
- Do you want me to cut your bangs?
- No. Let it be.

330
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,239
- My name is Nuno Mota. I am the
notary of Vila de S. Sebastião.

331
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,079
Yesterday your sister was here.

332
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,400
Yes.

333
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:35,280
She is the head of the couple and
that's why we can proceed

334
00:46:35,281 --> 00:46:39,281
with the distribution of his
deceased father's assets.

335
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,960
I'm so sorry... Has Angela been
to the village of S. Sebastiao?

336
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,519
Angela Antunes, right?

337
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,599
Angela Antunes, yes.

338
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,599
- I wanted to know what day Ms.
Josefina could come to my office.

339
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:58,119
Just a question. Don't you
have her contact information?

340
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:00,719
- I can't make it easy
for you, Ms. Josefina.

341
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,039
- But we set a date and you
clarifies everything with your sister.

342
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:12,559
A hypothesis: if the mother
comes back, what happens?

343
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,760
Well...

344
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:21,039
- If the mother comes back, it's obvious
that the mother always has priority.

345
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:23,760
But if...

346
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,480
how am I supposed to
explain this? And so...

347
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:34,679
having a history of a mother who has
already dropped out different times,

348
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,880
how does this work?

349
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,960
Only if something very serious happened

350
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,480
- is that it could be prevented the
union between a mother and a child.

351
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:51,400
Is everything all right, Dona Josefina?

352
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,039
Oh aunt.

353
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:10,119
Aunt!

354
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:12,440
Aunt, can you buy me this sweater?

355
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:14,800
- So ugly.
- Is nothing.

356
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,039
Do you like it?

357
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,000
I like.

358
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,400
Come on, come here.

359
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:22,960
What size is it.

360
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,800
Yes, it's just one.

361
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:28,320
It's an M.

362
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:29,880
Can you try it?

363
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,899
Yes.

364
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,599
- How much is it?
- Ten.

365
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:33,840
- How much?
- Ten.

366
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,559
- Three?
- Ten. Ten euros.

367
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:36,519
- Ten?!
- Yeah.

368
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:43,000
- Do you like that?
- I like!

369
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:45,960
It's okay.

370
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:48,679
So Josephine?

371
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,599
Angela.

372
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,920
Do you want to come in?

373
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:14,840
I go first.

374
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,039
How is Alexandre?

375
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,880
It's okay.

376
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,599
where is he?

377
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,840
he walks with football games
there at the championship and...

378
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,440
today comes a little later.

379
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,199
Are there oranges?

380
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,679
No. This year I haven't
picked oranges yet.

381
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,079
I miss the oranges in our backyard.

382
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,639
Everything is so neat.

383
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,119
I'm sorry he's not here.

384
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:21,239
I went through moments very complicated.

385
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:29,199
I was hospitalized and...

386
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:32,039
meanwhile i got married

387
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,360
with a wonderful man
which has helped me a lot.

388
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,559
And I think I'm ready to restart

389
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:47,079
and I would love to
have my son by my side.

390
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,199
I will leave my card here.

391
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,880
Tell Alexandre to call me.

392
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,920
Why didn't you wake me up, aunt?

393
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,840
Good Morning.

394
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:41,360
Sorry, I fell asleep.

395
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,000
So what about Professor
Filipe didn't call?

396
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:46,239
He called, but I don't know why the
phone was silent and did not hear.

397
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:49,639
Aunt, we have a day full of
important games. I really have to go.

398
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,320
No, it's not important. you never stay here
having lunch with me so you'll stay today.

399
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,760
Auntie, but I really have to go.

400
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,880
How are you going? Say it...

401
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,079
- I'll go by taxi.
- Are you taking a taxi? With which money?

402
00:58:58,239 --> 00:58:59,920
With mine from my savings.

403
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,559
alexander i don't want
you to walk by taxi alone.

404
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,280
Aunt, I'm not a baby anymore.

405
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:09,079
And if you're that worried,
buy me a cell phone.

406
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,199
Play, play!

407
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,199
Look here, look here!

408
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,339
Look here.

409
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,119
Go!

410
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:19,440
Come on, Alexandre. Let's go!

411
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:22,699
Shoot!

412
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,199
You're going to fail, big guy!

413
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:26,639
- Good!
- You're a sham.

414
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:29,920
Alexander.

415
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,039
Come on, Frederick! Good feint.

416
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:32,039
Go Go!

417
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:32,900
Cut!

418
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,760
Come on Alexander is yours. Kick!

419
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:37,000
Goal!

420
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:40,199
Well played!

421
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:42,000
Congratulations. Congratulations.

422
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:49,239
look... you're going to high school
in S. Joao in September, or not?

423
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,760
Yes I will. You're
going too, aren't you?

424
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,559
- Go, go.
- It's gonna be really cool.

425
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:53,599
- Hi.
- Hi.

426
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:55,039
Has the mother arrived yet?

427
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,400
No Fred, I think it's
Rafa who come pick us up.

428
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,239
Okay I'll see.

429
01:00:00,519 --> 01:00:02,199
- Then fine?
- Hi.

430
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:07,320
- You know yesterday was really cool
after the game. - It was, wasn't it?

431
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,760
- Did you get home all right?
- I arrived, you too?

432
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,880
- You played really well.
- Thanks.

433
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,960
My brother is not so much anymore.

434
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,159
Oh, don't say that.

435
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,119
Claudia!

436
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:18,679
He is my brother.

437
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:19,639
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

438
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:23,719
What are you doing here?

439
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,320
I came to see you play.

440
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,280
But weren't we supposed to meet at home?

441
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,360
So we came back together.

442
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:33,480
Are you hungry?

443
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:34,800
I'm hungry.

444
01:00:48,599 --> 01:00:50,320
Wasn't this grandfather's cell phone?

445
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:53,280
It was. And now it's yours.

446
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,599
There you have my number.

447
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,280
And I put money on your cell phone
in case you need to talk to me.

448
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,280
Thank you aunt.

449
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,280
Aunt,

450
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,920
there will be several parties
now farewell to the second cycle.

451
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:19,280
But I just wanted to
go to one. I can go?

452
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,280
And you only want to go to one, why?

453
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,239
For the aunt to let me go.

454
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,239
And this is when?

455
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,679
For the week.

456
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:42,519
If you're good, it can be.

457
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:46,599
If you don't behave, you won't.

458
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,000
And you Gabriel, what are you drawing?

459
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:53,800
It's a duck and a rabbit.

460
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,239
Philip!

461
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,760
Hey there!

462
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,360
Oh, Bruno!

463
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,480
Can I talk to Alexandre?

464
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:15,840
Alexander can you get
up please and come here?

465
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:22,440
Son...

466
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,079
Excuse.

467
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:23,079
This is Edgar, my husband.

468
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,880
Alexander, my son.

469
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:25,800
Hi.

470
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,079
I went to the house there.

471
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,840
You weren't. I left my number,

472
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,519
I was waiting for you to call me.

473
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:57,679
Did you go?

474
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,360
Did not know...

475
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:04,320
The aunt didn't tell me anything.

476
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:30,639
Do you want more
bread? That I won't eat.

477
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:33,320
It's okay.

478
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:35,639
Is very.

479
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:37,199
Enough, enough.

480
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,039
My son is fantastic, isn't he?

481
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,280
He is.

482
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:24,960
What do you think of the three
of us going to live together?

483
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,000
Me, you and Edgar.

484
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:32,679
So what about Aunt Josefina?

485
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,440
- My dear...
- She's been taking care of me.

486
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,280
The aunt came to help
you and I appreciate it.

487
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,360
But that's life.

488
01:05:44,519 --> 01:05:46,119
What do you say?

489
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,479
Alexandre, don't be late!

490
01:08:41,479 --> 01:08:42,520
You are listening?

491
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:51,239
Your mother also takes pictures
of you to body parts or hair?

492
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:53,600
Like this?

493
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,079
What does she have my hair?

494
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:34,880
I am, good night.

495
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:36,560
Josefina?

496
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:40,359
Hello Angela.

497
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:42,840
Pass me to Alexandre, please.

498
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:48,239
Alexandre went to a party the
end of the course and it is not.

499
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:50,439
Come on. Go call him.

500
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:53,239
Angela I'm telling you
that Alexandre is not here.

501
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:54,760
He never is?

502
01:10:55,159 --> 01:10:58,279
- You're gonna make me go
there to talk to Alexandre?

503
01:10:58,319 --> 01:10:59,720
Come on. Go call him.

504
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,319
Do what you want.

505
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,960
I don't know what else to tell you.

506
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:06,760
I'm sick of calling and he
doesn't answer his cell phone.

507
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:08,399
Are you the one with it?

508
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:11,479
Do not.

509
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:13,000
It's okay.

510
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:14,960
So, good bye.

511
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:16,279
Goodnight.

512
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,000
- Come on.
- Help here.

513
01:12:51,399 --> 01:12:52,600
The state of this guy...

514
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,119
Rafael, look at his coat.

515
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,520
Screw this!

516
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,720
Calm.

517
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:07,680
The key?

518
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:13,760
Calm.

519
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:18,159
Open the door there.

520
01:13:19,159 --> 01:13:20,640
Are you okay or not?
Are you okay to enter?

521
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:21,520
I am.

522
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:23,520
Calm.

523
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,000
You are fine?

524
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,560
Come here.

525
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:45,920
Can you support yourself there?

526
01:13:46,199 --> 01:13:48,119
Help me take your pants off... Go.

527
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,159
Look, just to let you know I'm leaving.

528
01:14:17,479 --> 01:14:19,039
Alexander then?

529
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:22,239
- Are you leaving like this?
- Yea.

530
01:14:22,359 --> 01:14:23,159
Because?

531
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:24,800
Since you lied to me
and cheated. It is not?

532
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:26,119
- I lied? On what?
- Yea!

533
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:28,279
That my mother was here at home
and she didn't tell me anything.

534
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:30,319
she left you her number and
she hid it from me, didn't she.

535
01:14:30,359 --> 01:14:31,960
- We can talk?
- I don't want conversations with you.

536
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,239
Wait, wait, wait. We can talk?

537
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,119
Sometimes, since you lie to me so much, he
could have lied to me about my father too.

538
01:14:37,159 --> 01:14:38,760
- I did not lie. I didn't lie to you!
- Let go of me. Drop me!

539
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,119
- I didn't lie to you, Alexandre.
- Let go of me, let go of me!

540
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:42,640
- Let go of me, let go of me!
- I didn't lie to you, I didn't lie to you.

541
01:15:53,359 --> 01:15:55,199
Mom, are we going to have dinner?

542
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:01,960
Baby, do you bring
the suitcase over here?

543
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:10,399
Let's have dinner?

544
01:16:11,239 --> 01:16:13,039
Love, give money to Alexandre

545
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:16,079
for him to go eat something.

546
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:23,039
He arrives?

547
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:27,079
But weren't we all going together?

548
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:31,159
go to the restaurant
down here and eat anything

549
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:32,880
that we are already jaded.

550
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:34,880
Come here, Alexandre, come.

551
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,439
Listen...

552
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:39,439
your mother has been with
migraine in the last few days.

553
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,079
That's why we'd better stay, is it?

554
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,359
Okay. But do you want something?

555
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:45,680
No, nothing is needed.

556
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,439
But go is fast, before it closes.

557
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:52,960
Oh, and if there's no money, say down
there that we go there tomorrow and pay.

558
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,600
What are you talking about?

559
01:19:51,479 --> 01:19:53,439
I want to leave please.

560
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:54,920
I can no longer...

561
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:55,720
What?

562
01:19:56,279 --> 01:19:57,439
I can no longer do it.

563
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,960
Can't what?

564
01:20:01,319 --> 01:20:03,720
Angela, talk to me.

565
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,119
Can't what?

566
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:07,439
Let's go.

567
01:20:09,159 --> 01:20:10,680
Let's go where?

568
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:14,720
Please let's go.

569
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:16,800
Where are we going, Angela?

570
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:20,000
I don't want to go back to that house.

571
01:20:20,119 --> 01:20:22,600
- I don't want to, please.
- Calm down, Angela.

572
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:27,640
Angela, Angela.

573
01:20:30,199 --> 01:20:32,680
Calm down, will you?
Calm down, calm down.

574
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,079
- Good night.
- Good night.

575
01:21:37,159 --> 01:21:39,199
I want a strong drink.

576
01:22:03,199 --> 01:22:04,239
Please.

577
01:23:32,279 --> 01:23:33,399
What is your name?

578
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:36,840
Josephine.

579
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:38,600
Josefina...

580
01:23:41,479 --> 01:23:44,159
It's a good name, Josefina.

581
01:23:45,439 --> 01:23:47,520
My mother chose it.

582
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,920
And where are you from?

583
01:24:01,399 --> 01:24:02,880
I'm from here.

584
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,359
Of Untim.

585
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:07,720
From the Douro.

586
01:24:08,199 --> 01:24:10,279
Untim from the Douro.

587
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:37,640
Well,

588
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:41,739
finish it there and I'll take you home.

589
01:24:41,774 --> 01:24:44,239
Not because my nephew is picking me up.

590
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,600
No...

591
01:28:49,119 --> 01:28:51,199
Aunt, no. Aunt, come here I'll help.

592
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:54,039
Aunt, come here. Aunt, come here.

593
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,760
Come here. Pass the arm.

594
01:28:58,795 --> 01:28:59,800
Come here.

595
01:29:04,399 --> 01:29:05,680
Can you climb?

596
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,279
Lean there...

597
01:29:27,319 --> 01:29:29,159
Aunt, do you want me
to go get you something?

598
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:30,760
Do not stay here.

599
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:32,800
Stay here.

600
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:35,359
Sit here next to me.

601
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:45,199
There is so much that I I
would like to explain to you.

602
01:29:45,239 --> 01:29:47,960
- Aunt, don't talk now. Let it be.
- I do not know how...

603
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,439
Aunt...
