1
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,360
Chief... My Chief, the
worst has passed, huh?

2
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:20,351
What are you doing here, hick!

3
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
I'd be damned if I didn't
greet my Chief out of jail!

4
00:01:24,035 --> 00:01:25,805
See that?

5
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,965
Chief Çetin, how was the prison?

6
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,956
Anywhere with Chief Muro
is a swell place, Yýldýrým.

7
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,605
Stop sucking up!

8
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,108
Let me have it...
Chief, your bag.

9
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,117
Yýldýrým, the door won't close.

10
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,395
Damn, a revolutionist should be
an expert of all technical gizmo.

11
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,871
Pull the door in...
Idiot...Prick...

12
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,512
At your command, Chief. Tell me
the place and I'll take you there.

13
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,513
Take us to the terminal, Yýldýrým.

14
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,515
Terminal? Why Chief, the house is
available, my boss left for vacation.

15
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,314
They're gone for full three months.

16
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,115
You can rest, and we
can stay together, huh?

17
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,495
Chief, we can always go to the
village; it's been staying in...

18
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,671
... its place for five thousand
years on all its feudal roots.

19
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,797
Let's lay back a while, live
Istanbul, shake off our stress...

20
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,395
- ... then we can leave.
- What do you say, Chief?

21
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,005
So Chief, are we really
going get married?

22
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,838
Yes Çetin, I've told you a hundred
times, we'll go get married.

23
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,960
Gee Chief, how do we make
a revolution by marrying?

24
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:32,685
Can two broads achieve
what we couldn't?

25
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,917
Çetin, there isn't enough
windows in the bus...

26
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,672
... to blow your
stinking ignorance.

27
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,440
- Who can we call a revolutionist?
- Pardon me brother, but who?

28
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:44,238
Your mother, you douche...
Give me my water...

29
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,992
Thanks...

30
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,238
A revolutionist is the ideal man,
a knowing person.

31
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,956
We are to go get married.
Start the revolution from the bed...

32
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,396
... then extend to the house by means
of the kids, then to the village...

33
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,279
... to the city, and then
to the whole country.

34
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,713
Wait till the cows come home
and eat the clovers...

35
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,396
Stop being a cow, I'll find you
the clovers, you douche.

36
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,314
- Bro, this is one good cake, can
I have another one? - Okay.

37
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,356
Here Çetin, stuff yourself with this!

38
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,710
I don't get it bro, what are
you so edgy about?

39
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,045
What's that to you man?
Mind your own business.

40
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,150
I've only meant to hand you
a bag, if you are car sick!

41
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,158
Why, are you a bagger?
l'm no carsick, you made me sick!

42
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,512
Alright, alright...
Push the button if you need me.

43
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,845
Which one? This?

44
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,320
Leave the buttons now.
We are having a word.

45
00:04:34,355 --> 00:04:36,038
Chief, no need to be tense, relax.

46
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,440
We'll see if we can find a nice
broad who suits us in the village...

47
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:40,829
... or else take the bus
and return to lstanbul!

48
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,160
Just as no one believed that the great
Lenin was to make the revolution...

49
00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:01,436
... on his return from Germany exile;
today as my comrade Çetin...

50
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,240
... sawing logs beside me and l,
are beating our brains out on...

51
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:08,880
... poky bus seats over the tactics
and strategy of revolution...

52
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:11,474
... of course no one
shall believe in me.

53
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,235
But even if the whole
capitalist world opposes me...

54
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,274
... the bourgeois class says no, no
feudal man gives away his daughter...

55
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,805
... I swear on cosmos
that I'd still get married...

56
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,753
... set an example with my humble
family life and make the revolution.

57
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,398
Çetin, I greet you with all
my revolutionist emotions.

58
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,553
Yes?

59
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,756
Bro, do you have nescafe?

60
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,911
Yes. Here.

61
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,320
Çetin, I keep telling you to stay
away from imperialist products...

62
00:06:00,355 --> 00:06:02,231
... while you insist on
shoving them to my face!

63
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,160
Chief, a man needs to know his
enemy; if we have waged a war...

64
00:06:05,195 --> 00:06:07,320
... against imperialists, we
should get to know them.

65
00:06:07,355 --> 00:06:09,550
I didn't buy it, Çetin.
I didn't.

66
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,111
- l'm burning! l'm burning!
- Take it out...

67
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,034
Take your pants off, or else
you'll get burned all over...

68
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,245
Leave my long john alone...

69
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,432
Friends, comrades, stop the bus,
my revolutionist balls are on fire!

70
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,069
l'm burning, Çetin, l'm burning!

71
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,276
Hand it to me, Chief.

72
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,312
- Chief, which grounds did
we lose? - Shut up Çetin!

73
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,278
Bro, you have found water
and started bathing in it!

74
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,125
Come on now,
passengers are waiting.

75
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,578
- Don't get me started!
- Chief, what are you up to?

76
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:48,996
There are ladies in the bus,
you must wear it first!

77
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,598
Çetin, l won't wear it!

78
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,713
Damn it! Damn it!

79
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,637
Chief, have a sip. Coffee is
said to take off the edge.

80
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,360
lt took the most off me,
Çetin! lt's still burning.

81
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,990
At last Çetin, we are on the
earth where history of revolution.

82
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,509
- Uff!
- Don't say uff!

83
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,909
Howdy Emin Gakko,
l've come to rescue you all.

84
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,355
What rescuing are
you talking about?

85
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,712
Bro, what happened to your voice?

86
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,235
Look Çetin, when a man gets old,
his voice may change like this.

87
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,040
Mukhtar, good for you,
you have opened the store in...

88
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:32,360
... the crack of dawn so that
no one lays his hands on it.

89
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:33,885
- Where'd you come from?
- My answer is...

90
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,469
Mukhtar, why don't you say your
blessings, let me kiss your hand.

91
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,916
Have a seat and l'll
prepare the tea.

92
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,148
Çetin, when will you give up
these feudal habits of yours?

93
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,278
- Are you hungry? Will you eat?
- Nope.

94
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,873
We are a little hungry, Uncle.

95
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,594
Why Çetin, haven't you stuffed
yourself with cakes on the bus?

96
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,320
They said you would not be
able to come out of prison...

97
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:57,685
... before thirty years.

98
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,760
We apologize for coming
out so early; if we'd known...

99
00:08:59,795 --> 00:09:01,157
... we'd have stayed for a while!

100
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:02,519
So, what are you
going to do now?

101
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,239
What will we do? We have
come to settle in the village.

102
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,548
What?

103
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,034
Folks move from the village to city,
you will move to village, right?

104
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,236
- See that Chief?
- Right?

105
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,073
When we marry two nice
ladies and come to power...

106
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,236
... in the village, you won't be
able to hold the villagers back in...

107
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,710
... ten years, l swear this will
be a global revolution village.

108
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,711
What marriage?

109
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,594
Uncle, you've just said no one
was left in the village...

110
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:30,388
... l hope there are one or two
decent single girls left.

111
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,759
One, at least?

112
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,350
- You can't get married.
- Why, aren't we men?

113
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,558
You are already married!

114
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,313
Look Çetin, we are facing
another typical feudal joke.

115
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,751
Mukhtar, haven't you
recognized us?

116
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,592
We are the red singles
Muro and Çeto.

117
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,830
- Muro, l've married you off...
- With whom?

118
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,638
- Two Russian girls.
- What?

119
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,525
Where?
Are they living in village?

120
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,039
Mukhtar, you are worth your salt.
They are beautiful, aren't they?

121
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,485
Damn Çetin, zip your mouth.

122
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,520
Chief, they are Russians,
they must be revolutionists.

123
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,397
Revolutionists my ass,
they are prostitutes.

124
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,078
Mukhtar, do you hear
what you are saying?

125
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,645
Why have you married
us off to whores?

126
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,717
Remember l've sent you five
hundred dollars each in prison?

127
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,911
What, what dollars?

128
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,116
Remember we were
a little short in cash?

129
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,278
You've sold your Chief, yourself and
the revolution for five hundred dollars,

130
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,480
... haven't you, you crook?

131
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,565
What would l know, Chief?

132
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,591
Mukhtar sold us and
send us the money.

133
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,440
Damn you Çetin, if we
pull ourselves from this shit...

134
00:10:21,475 --> 00:10:22,998
... l swear l will put a
bullet to your head.

135
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,200
Mukhtar, tell me you're joking; l
swear l'll laugh at this cruel joke...

136
00:10:26,235 --> 00:10:28,400
... of yours for four days
without stopping for breath.

137
00:10:28,435 --> 00:10:29,958
l don'tjoke with marriage!

138
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,360
Girls needed certain methods
in order to stay in Turkey.

139
00:10:33,395 --> 00:10:34,325
So?

140
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,669
My Son Muzo said, ''Muro
is my childhood friend.''

141
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,716
- So l've married you off.
- ls that so?

142
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,031
Write it down Çetin,
one lousy cell phone...

143
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,513
... one Hadji Muro and one
ball-saving baggy trouser are...

144
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,592
... confiscated on
behalf of revolution.

145
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,350
Come on Çetin.

146
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,039
Damn Muro, you were always a bandit
and you will always be a bandit!

147
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,309
Put those back in the glove
box Çetin, don't piss me off.

148
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,878
The number you have called
is temporarily unavailable...

149
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,400
How long is temporary, man?
Give me some information.

150
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:49,391
l need to find this Muzo prick.

151
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,756
Chief, l suggest we take a
medical opinion in lstanbul.

152
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,436
Thank you Çetin for caring for
every single part of your Chief.

153
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,556
- Chief, here we are.
- Don't shout in my ear.

154
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Welcome in lstanbul? l swear l'm
willing to sacrifice half of my life...

155
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:25,678
... to live in lstanbul. There
is no other city like it!

156
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,239
Pass it, pass it.

157
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,400
l swear Sultan Mehmet
wasn't as rejoiced as you...

158
00:12:29,435 --> 00:12:31,332
... when he conquered lstanbul.

159
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:33,229
Chief, metropolises are our home.

160
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,151
lf we were to drown, we
should be drowned in a big city.

161
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,352
l'll see you when we find the girls
and have them sign divorce papers.

162
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,916
At most, you'll be drowning in the
shitty stream of the village. Pull off.

163
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,245
Why Chief?

164
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,033
l'll drive because l'm a
cunning metropolis chap.

165
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,477
l resent it, Chief. l know lstanbul
like the back of my hand.

166
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,790
l'll take you there
with my eyes closed.

167
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,273
Where do you head off to?
We forgot the photos.

168
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,405
Chief, shall we ask these girls?

169
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,908
Damn your love for
women, douchebag!

170
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,353
- Welcome gentlemen, welcome.
- Hi.

171
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,919
- Welcome, welcome.
- Hello brother. - Hello.

172
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,520
Bro, there's a man called Muzaffer
Gündüz. Dark, crispy guy.

173
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,320
He has an office around
here, do you know him?

174
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:51,765
- l swear l don't know bro.
- Okay then.

175
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,031
- What's the deal? - Well, actually,
we are looking for two women.

176
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,270
We have women inside.
Come on in bro, come on.

177
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,749
Thanks.

178
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,480
Damn Çetin, why are you
jumping inside without...

179
00:15:01,515 --> 00:15:02,840
... asking the women
we are looking for?

180
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,876
We'll see when we get in.

181
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,356
- Welcome misters.
- Thanks.

182
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,999
What would you like?

183
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,485
What would you like to have?

184
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,829
Bro, we're looking for Muzaffer
Gündüz. We'll take him and leave.

185
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,040
- Who? - Muzaffer Gündüz.
Muzo, Muzo.

186
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:50,792
A sucker with a crispy dark face.

187
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,996
Muzaffer...
He hasn't showed up today.

188
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,116
- Do you know him bro?
- l know him.

189
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,918
He had an office,
do you know where?

190
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,032
Two streets from here,
Zafer Travel Agency.

191
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,485
Come on Çetin, we are off.

192
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,960
He should be in his office
in the morning, Chief.

193
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,075
Maybe he is in the
office right now?

194
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,833
We are hungry, let us have
a few bite, drink a few cup.

195
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,965
Damn you Çetin, l'll feed
you outside, beat it!

196
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,072
Chief, maybe we'll find the girls
here, so we won't need Muzo.

197
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,640
We will be saving tonight, you
know, save our girls from others.

198
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:15,805
OK Çetin, zip it!

199
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,274
Guys, fully set the table with food.

200
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,875
No need for that, bro!
We are only looking. Hey!

201
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,789
- Chief?
- Huh?

202
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,070
Are all these women
married to guys like us?

203
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,525
What do you mean by
''like us'', Çetin?

204
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,233
- l mean, ambushed...
- How the heck l know?

205
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,958
We've lived for so long in
lstanbul; not once...

206
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,365
... you've taken me
to a place like this.

207
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,470
What business would a
revolutionist have here?

208
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,154
l wonder why capitalists
have all the places where...

209
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,430
... beautiful gals flock,
and revolutionists don't!

210
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,637
Because Çetin, only a man of
small bourgeoisie weak spots...

211
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,031
... lacking a revolutionary moral,
will come here. lmagine us here!

212
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,396
What the hell is that? Bro, these
are too much, take them away.

213
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,796
Perhaps you'll have company.

214
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,428
What company?
We don't know anyone.

215
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,313
Want me to call
two to your table?

216
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,750
You prick, do you hear
what you are saying?

217
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,713
God knows to whom these
women are married... Come on.

218
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,791
- Chief, this one looks single.
- Which one? - The purple one.

219
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,879
How do you know Çetin?

220
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,595
No married woman
shakes it like that, Chief.

221
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,110
Behave yourself Çetin and
act like a revolutionist!

222
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,396
lt hurts Çetin, it really does.

223
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,879
Where does it hurt, Chief?

224
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,725
Nowhere dick,
it hurts in the inside.

225
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,672
l'm trying to get over and you
keep reminding me of my balls!

226
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,680
No way, am l the one to remind
you of your thing, out of these broads?

227
00:18:25,715 --> 00:18:27,272
Get lost!

228
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,913
- Hi.
- Hi! Here, here.

229
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,038
- Olga.
- Çetin.

230
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,709
Damn you Çetin, why are
you letting the girl sit down?

231
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,719
Chief, the gal liked me, so what
do l do, chase here away?

232
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,876
- What? - Break her heart?
She has a heart, too.

233
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,755
Let me introduce you;
Olga, this is my Chief Muro.

234
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,070
- Nice to meet you.
- The same here.

235
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,511
- What shall l bring you?
- Champagne.

236
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,879
Damn Çetin, if your sweetheart
leaves the bill on us...

237
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,473
... l swear l'll get
even with you.

238
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,314
Chill out for God's sake,
let us get a kick out of it.

239
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,591
- Where are you from?
- Ukraine.

240
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,751
- Where in Ukraine?
- Kiev.

241
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,956
- You?
- Ýstanbul.

242
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,912
Bullshitter.

243
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,312
- Your friend, alone?
- Do you have a friend?

244
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,393
- Your friend likes my friend?
- Then go get her.

245
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,231
You hick, the girl is leaving,
chase her away.

246
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,232
lt's okay Chief,
she's coming back.

247
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,796
Her friend liked you.
So l've told her to go get her.

248
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,916
Friend?

249
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,515
Possibly, they might
know our girls, right?

250
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,108
Possibly...
Needs questioning.

251
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,510
- Hi, Anna... - Muro.
- Anna. - Çetin.

252
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,235
- What shall l bring?
- Bro, why are you cutting in?

253
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,515
We've just met; give us some
space, stop interrupting!

254
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,915
- What shall he bring?
- Champaign mojna?

255
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,468
- You won't go lower than that
of course. - You be rude.

256
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,596
What did you see in me to
jump into that conclusion?

257
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,076
You see a lady, you don't
stand up? Are you a caveman?

258
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
Yes, l'm a caveman,
do you mind?

259
00:20:14,235 --> 00:20:15,445
Thank you.

260
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,631
l'm the one who pays for it and
you thank him? Thank me!

261
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,200
Çetin, what's she gibbering about?

262
00:20:20,235 --> 00:20:21,565
You are very rude.
l don't want you.

263
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,431
l don't want someone
who doesn't want me.

264
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,117
Please, please. Sit down.
Chief, show a little courtesy.

265
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,829
l've talked to them; they
said they knew our girls.

266
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,518
- Really Çetin?
- l swear.

267
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:39,914
Pardon me, we're tired of the road.
That's why we're a bit tense.

268
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,908
Anna...

269
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,958
- 300 dollar for two hours.
- Okay.

270
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,837
- What are they saying, Çetin?
- Chief l swear l didn't get a thing.

271
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,276
Miss Anna, l have
questions for you.

272
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,869
l talk in the room,
l take cash money.

273
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,873
- What room, what money?
- Okay l've given Olga the money.

274
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,476
- lt's okay, l've got the money.
- Good.

275
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,925
What money Çetin?

276
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,996
Chief, we can't keep the
girls around anymore.

277
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,714
- That's why we have to take
them to the rooms. - So, Çetin?

278
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,234
We need to give some
money in the rooms...

279
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,325
... after all they belong
to the working class.

280
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,794
Why should they have to
give up their hard-earned wages?

281
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,913
l didn't buy it, Çetin. l didn't! Don't
involve revolution in your dirty works.

282
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,960
What the heck?
Pay the bill Çetin.

283
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,554
- Brother?
- What?

284
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,993
Bro, don't forget to see me, okay?

285
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,520
How can l forget you bro,
you're standing right here!

286
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:37,317
You are a strong man,
why beg?

287
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,918
Çetin, where are the girls?

288
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,389
They're gone to bring
something to wear, Chief.

289
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,674
- So, Çetin? - So, Chief, l
believe we can get them to talk.

290
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,355
You're right. They won't be
resisting our questioning methods.

291
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,118
How can they, Chief?

292
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,914
There's no women to resist
our questioning methods.

293
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,790
Not only women, Çetin.
Men, women, no difference.

294
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,151
- lt's our taxi. - No, thanks. We
have our own car, we can take it!

295
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,115
Chief, girls got in. lt'll
be a shame if we don't.

296
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,238
- Okay then l'll take the front
seat. - You know better.

297
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,595
Thank you bro, don't
bother yourself.

298
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,313
- Brother, don't forget us, huh?
- Cosmos won't forget you bro.

299
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,953
Come on!

300
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,792
Don't forget us,
don't forget us!

301
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,352
- ldentities please.
- Çetin, take out your lD.

302
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,030
- Both of you.
- What? - Both of you.

303
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,834
Çetin! We're in the records now.

304
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,953
Nesim, take care of friends.

305
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,476
This way.

306
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,872
Here, that way.

307
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,032
Thanks, bro.

308
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,272
Let me show you the
place of TV, fridge, A/C.

309
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,517
No need bro, are we cavemen?
We can recognize TV, and fridge.

310
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,680
- Don't forget to see me.
- Why the hell would l see you?

311
00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:34,318
My eyes popped out for
seeing you all day.

312
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,750
Let Çetin see you now.
Çetin, see how cute he is.

313
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,359
Come on...

314
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,476
Sir, your room is that way.

315
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,158
- Honey, champagne mojna?
- Go inside honey.

316
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,558
- No Champagne left?
- We have!

317
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,751
l said what l've said,
come on dear.

318
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,350
What do you get from
these bourgeois channels?

319
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,829
- Likes music...
- Who likes music?

320
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,685
l don't like talking,
l like music.

321
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,837
Why? Are we here to listen
to the music?

322
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,917
What's that?

323
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,085
- You very rude.
- You'd be rude too...

324
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,395
... if you'd been crashed by the
weight of revolution like me.

325
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,795
- Honey, do you shower?
- What showering?

326
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,800
- Wait, l'll first ask you a question
or two. - Showering first!

327
00:24:22,835 --> 00:24:24,358
You're obsessed
with showering!

328
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,909
Tell me, do you know the Russians
who are working here?

329
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,005
l know no one.

330
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,085
So, how'd you pick up
Turkish language?

331
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,908
Honey, l had a boy friend
in Kiev, a total dick.

332
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,805
l learn Turkish from him.

333
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,832
Stop talking about a dick.
Let's not mention a man by-gone.

334
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,634
You called me rude, but you
are the one who is rude.

335
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,593
Listen, my reason
for calling you here is...

336
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,473
Honey you shower first,
then do the reasoning.

337
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,438
Holy Mother, nothing is stinking.
Shower, shower, shower!

338
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,273
Rude! You curse your mother?
Shame on you!

339
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,280
- No! That's a phrase.
- l love mother very much. You don't?

340
00:24:58,315 --> 00:25:00,589
l love my mother too.
What's it with the mothers?

341
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,910
What is the poor woman
doing in this room?

342
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,873
- Olga, you are so pretty.
- You liar.

343
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,270
- What do you find pretty about me?
- What do you find ugly about you?

344
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,711
l no like my lips!

345
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,110
Cupcake, how can you
not like these lips?

346
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,519
Let me have a kiss.

347
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:25,076
- Olga, these are full of honey.
- Çeto, you funny.

348
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,309
Of course you
can call me Çeto.

349
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,285
Honey, l want champagne.

350
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,959
Look they're calling.
Apparently there is none, gosh!

351
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,349
Hello? This is Russian?

352
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:48,671
Hello. Hi. We're sitting, where
is yours? ln the shower?

353
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,952
Çeto, your friend is in the
shower. You shower, too.

354
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,958
What shower?
Business first, shower second.

355
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,038
l talk to friend Anna now.
You shower?

356
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,353
Chief, is this the
time for showering?

357
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,511
Damn this faucet!

358
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,159
Olga, here l am!

359
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,918
Yeah, you know what? He's
very handsome, classy man.

360
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,234
- Come on now, hang up.
- No, of course not.

361
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,719
Yeah, l like it very much.

362
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,829
- Why don't you hang up?
- Just a second, honey.

363
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,913
- Goodness Gracious Me!
- Yeah, of course.

364
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,912
Wait a sec, someone's at the door.

365
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,595
- Chief is in the shower?
- Yeah, come in.

366
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,519
What is it?

367
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,399
Chief, you are in the shower for an
hour, the hotel has run out of water.

368
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,232
What's it to you?
l've paid for it, haven't l?

369
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,277
l can either shower, or
leave the water running.

370
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,480
No Chief, my girl doesn't stop
talking on the phone while...

371
00:27:26,515 --> 00:27:28,440
... you stay in the shower,
they are chatting non-stop.

372
00:27:28,475 --> 00:27:29,953
Damn you Çetin.

373
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,594
A man can't even be left alone in
the bathroom, alright l'm coming.

374
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,875
Are you questioning
with this attitude Çetin?

375
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,485
l have to, Chief.

376
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,476
l am following what ever
she says to get her to talk.

377
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,630
l may even sacrifice
myself in this cause.

378
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,274
No kidding; live bomb Çetin, huh?

379
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,600
Come on Chief, the clock
is ticking, please hurry.

380
00:27:55,635 --> 00:27:56,953
Don't rush me.

381
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,845
l'm working on a new
questioning method.

382
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,553
l'm mentally wearing her down
by taking a long shower.

383
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,760
Chief, your loss is great,
don't tire yourself out.

384
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:05,432
l'll get mine to crack anyway!

385
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,636
Am l such a naive that l'll
leave revolution on your hands?

386
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,557
- Beat it now!
- Enjoy it, Chief.

387
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,392
Get out of here.

388
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,558
l had my shower.

389
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,509
- Now l take shower.
- Yes.

390
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,109
You've talked my head off.

391
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,605
What do you look at, Muro?

392
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,551
Don't you see the girl has been
raised with revolutionist moral?

393
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,437
She does everything
but she never talks.

394
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,556
Why, you haven't dried yourself.
You'll get cold.

395
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:32,632
Honey, you're a great massager.
l'll answer all of your questions now.

396
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,636
Are you sure you're not hurt?
My hands are a little hard.

397
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,118
No honey, l like hard.

398
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,357
What do you mean by hard?

399
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,512
ls it okay?

400
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:53,674
- Honey, it's okay, go a little lower.
- How low?

401
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,885
Come on, hurry up, walk!

402
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,150
- Let go of my arm, it hurts!
- Let me go!

403
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,239
- Now, what were you asking?
- Do you know a Maria Rudenko?

404
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,155
- l don't.
- What?

405
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,158
- Çetin told me you knew her?
- l don't know her.

406
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,077
Damn Çetin, l'll crack you now!

407
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,955
What? Easy man, you're breaking it.
What the heck?

408
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,285
Vice Squad, prostitution.

409
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,440
What prostitution bro, do we
look like we are prostituting?

410
00:30:23,475 --> 00:30:24,793
Get dressed, we're off.

411
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,111
No! Please don't, please

412
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840
- Chief, have you cracked the girl?
- Damn you Çetin!

413
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,137
Let's pull ourselves
from this situation...

414
00:30:35,172 --> 00:30:37,026
... and you'll see how l'm
going to crack you!

415
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:38,845
Damn! l couldn't crack
either, l'm a mess!

416
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,553
- Okay okay don't push,
we're moving. - Come on!

417
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,676
Look bro, there must
be a misunderstanding.

418
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,318
We were in a
questioning session.

419
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,672
Nothing else but questioning.
Damn you Çetin!

420
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,605
Shame on you! You Muro,
the great chief of metropolis...

421
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:21,272
... and you Çeto, his assistant,
you are held for prostitution.

422
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:26,833
Yes, we're really ashamed.
We had never been in...

423
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,480
... such an unjust position
against sovereign powers.

424
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,478
But our intention was
solely to question.

425
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,995
ln a hotel room, while
you're stripped naked?

426
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,680
Why not? lt's okay when the folks
run naked around holiday villages...

427
00:31:38,715 --> 00:31:42,753
... but it's a crime when we tie
a tower around our waists?

428
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,713
Does it befit you to tie a towel,
instead of a rifle?

429
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,555
We know the place to tie a towel
and the place to tie the rifle!

430
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,718
You are talking about working
class, oppressed people.

431
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,799
But when it comes to you; you
are oppressing the poor girls?

432
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,236
Don't spark polemics; don't
engage me into demagogy.

433
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,550
l haven't brought these girls to the
country, nor have l made them...

434
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,679
... shake in clubs and discos, have
them lie on their backs in hotels!

435
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,838
And l have not closed my eyes
to them, using them three-star spies!

436
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,080
Now what are you holding
me accountable for?

437
00:32:12,115 --> 00:32:13,685
Shut the hell up!

438
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,280
Go tell your stories to other
losers you've been deceiving!

439
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,597
l am ready for struggle,
now come on, are you in?

440
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,478
l can put an end to
prostitution in two days!

441
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,855
These women will be grannies and
have granddaughters working as...

442
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:26,150
... hookers until you receive your
approval from your heads in Ankara!

443
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,669
- Take'em to their cells!
- Take us to our cells!

444
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,717
Do you think Muro will
stop talking in the cells?

445
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,553
l'm calling to the blind generation
of a revolutionist nation.

446
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,518
The imperialist system of
exploitation will turn you into...

447
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,405
... hookers and us into marketers.

448
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,113
Let's stand arm in arm
and call it a stop.

449
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,680
What did you do, putting
the cops into our arms?

450
00:32:43,715 --> 00:32:44,908
No room left for broads!

451
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,151
l'm on fire Çetin.
Hold on the shoulders.

452
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:57,758
Çetin! Çetin...

453
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,871
Hey Çeto...

454
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:11,471
- Wasn't l right in what l said?
- You were not, Chief.

455
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,280
Explain to me then, in
which part was l not right?

456
00:33:13,315 --> 00:33:14,965
All parts from start to finish.

457
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,072
Çetin, l think you are criticizing
your Chief with prejudice!

458
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,077
Well, we were already
caught in a weak spot.

459
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,725
lnspector had all the right
to say what he wanted.

460
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,280
lf you'd exercised your right to
silence, we would have been...

461
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:25,017
... cracking others
outside this cell.

462
00:33:25,052 --> 00:33:26,720
But you saw how that
spy provoked me!

463
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,245
He openly provoked me!

464
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,365
What are you doing
here, youngsters?

465
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,860
l didn't catch anything from
what you were telling!

466
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:36,320
Look, if l were to tell you
about unarmed propaganda...

467
00:33:36,355 --> 00:33:38,965
... you'd answer me
with ''six-pack or two-four?''

468
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,600
So close your eyes and sleep!
Çetin, get up and cooperate.

469
00:33:42,635 --> 00:33:45,512
Get us out of here,
l don't want to deal with drunks!

470
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,600
Chief, you are the one
cursing their mothers...

471
00:33:47,635 --> 00:33:49,280
... how am l to convince
their fathers?

472
00:33:49,315 --> 00:33:50,685
What did you say?

473
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,110
Officer, officer!
lnspector!

474
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,071
Thank you, Chief Çetin.

475
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,477
Çetin, my sugar dropped
down in the jail.

476
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,125
How about eating desserts?

477
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,116
l've eaten in jail until full, Chief,
enjoy your meal.

478
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,800
You are being hurtful, Çetin.
Bro, will you get me one?

479
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:16,473
Of course bro, here.

480
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,955
Çetin, it is crispy crunch.
Sorbet has perfect consistency.

481
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,151
- Won't you eat?
- Nope.

482
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,353
- Mate, how much is this?
- Where are you from brother?

483
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,553
What's it to you? Will you give a
discount from one lira to fifty kurush?

484
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,485
Be L'lnternationale!

485
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,273
Çetin, pay for the dessert,
l don't want to deal with him.

486
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,000
- Why is he so tense?
- Don't you see, his sugar dropped.

487
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:42,672
Here.

488
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,717
- Hi.
- Hi.

489
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,445
- ls Muzo here?
- Who are you?

490
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,960
Tell him that two duffers are here
who want to marry Russian girls.

491
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,916
ls he paying us 500$ each?

492
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,405
Mr. Muzaffer isn't here now.

493
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,760
l'll note down your numbers so he
can call you when he comes back.

494
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:30,560
- When will he come back?
- l don't know.

495
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,085
Then we'll wait inside.

496
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,395
You can't wait, you don't
have an appointment.

497
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,440
- You hick, stop it. Çetin, take
this bastard away. - Come here.

498
00:35:37,475 --> 00:35:39,445
Make us an appointment
for a minute past now!

499
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,677
- Sir, do you understand Turkish?
- Pardon me, l learned Turkish...

500
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,220
... at the age of ten and l'm
doing well for twenty years.

501
00:35:45,255 --> 00:35:47,680
- lt's your turn now! - You, crazy!
l don't understand you?

502
00:35:47,715 --> 00:35:49,989
Chief, you really like
to argue with women.

503
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,514
We should go inside and wait for
him, whether he comes or not.

504
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,875
Don't you see the damned
thing sparks a polemic!

505
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,839
- Muro?
- Muzo?

506
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,150
- Bro, when did you come out?
- lt's been thirty five years.

507
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:25,040
When did you come out, bastard?
Who are you to marry us off?

508
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,356
My father called. He said
you were in short of money.

509
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,553
Çetin, there are bunch of
other men in the village.

510
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,838
l'm doing you a favor in your hard times;
and you have come here to insult me.

511
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,798
Can't you give the money
without marrying us?

512
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,565
They were deceived.

513
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,360
The girls were led to believe
that here they'll be working...

514
00:36:46,395 --> 00:36:48,590
... in a textile workshop.
l felt pity for them.

515
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,877
l've married them to you so that the
poor things could feed themselves.

516
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,594
Thank God, Chief they were
not whores but the working class.

517
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,313
They are working in
a workshop, right?

518
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,713
Damn Çetin, stop talking nonsense
and getting on my nerves.

519
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,675
Muzo, call these women, get
them here and divorce us.

520
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,720
And from now on, stop making
favors and decently work...

521
00:37:07,755 --> 00:37:09,445
... in your own workshop.

522
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,630
That's piece of cake.
We'll handle it later.

523
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,877
Now let's go to my place. l'll have
my wife Fidan cook for you.

524
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,885
Don't move an arm;
l'm fed up with your lies.

525
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,275
We are not going anywhere.
You will take care of it today.

526
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,789
Then l'll take you to
dinner anywhere you like.

527
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,713
You are the one who demands divorce;
and still want the women coming to you.

528
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,990
No way, you have to go to them!

529
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,525
Damn Çetin, do you hear him?

530
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,471
He's talking like l've
begged him to marry me!

531
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,875
Muzo, are you sure
the women are here?

532
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,550
Muzo, are they here or not?

533
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,605
Surprise!

534
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,474
Sweetheart, l've made up
a dozen lies to get them here.

535
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,989
These villagers have
not missed you at all.

536
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:30,913
- Welcome, Mr. Murat. - lt's nice
to be here by force, Mrs. Fidan.

537
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,429
Come on in.

538
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,150
This husband of yours has
turned into a total bourgeois.

539
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,953
Sister Fidan, l've heard a lot
about you from my Chief.

540
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,719
This was the day to meet.
Nice to meet you.

541
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,799
Mr. Murat always has
something to say.

542
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,838
Thank you for the
trouble Mrs. Fidan.

543
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,871
What trouble Mr. Murat? Cold
yoghurt soup quenches thirst.

544
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,753
Chief and l were dying of thirst.
Thank you sister.

545
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,474
So, are you staying in
lstanbul for long?

546
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,710
No, Muzo and l have a short business
to take care of; then we'll leave.

547
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,313
What business?

548
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,518
l swear l'm very glad that you
gave up the organization.

549
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,830
We didn't give up the organization,
organization gave us up.

550
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,513
Thank God!

551
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,631
What are you talking about,
what quitting?

552
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,349
Muzo, stop dancing
around and call the girls.

553
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,516
You just have to name it, Chief.

554
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,713
What kind of a girl you desire?
Blond, brunette, Chinese?

555
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,789
What?

556
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,236
l'm such an idiot! Of course
you have just gotten out ofjail.

557
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,312
- Muzaffer, can you find
Olga and Anna? - Çetin!

558
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,480
Why not? Maybe they haven't left yet,
we should have our money's worth!

559
00:40:10,515 --> 00:40:12,596
- What money?
- What money, what women?

560
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,520
Just call the girls and
learn their whereabouts.

561
00:40:14,555 --> 00:40:15,873
Why are you so impatient?

562
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,845
What'll happen if you stay
married for one more day?

563
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,280
- Damn it, he's sparking a polemic.
- Don't be engaged in it.

564
00:40:20,315 --> 00:40:22,440
How can l resist?
Look, stop getting on my nerves.

565
00:40:22,475 --> 00:40:24,351
Call the women,
let's go to their place!

566
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,437
Okay, okay l am calling.

567
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,365
Hello, listen, reserve me two...

568
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,789
... most expensive luxury
rooms in the hotel, okay?

569
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,236
- What hotel, what room?
- Listen, l have VlP guests, okay?

570
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,675
Don't get me started with
the VlP or with guests!

571
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,230
Don't be silly, don't mention
the hotel. This is your home.

572
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,074
Thanks, but we should go.

573
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,880
Okay, l'm waiting to hear
from you. Don't let me down.

574
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,919
What are you going
to do in the village?

575
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,715
Stay here, let's do
business, trading.

576
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,917
- Trading?
- Another polemic has started.

577
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,072
Shuttle trade.
lt's still a cash cow.

578
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,674
l have partners in Russia, to
whom l send jeans, t-shirts, shirts.

579
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,950
They sell like hot cakes.

580
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,789
You wouldn't know how
obsessed they are with brands.

581
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,797
Do you hear what you say?

582
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,997
Muro, Muro the revolutionist, will
exploit the red Russian nation...

583
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,232
... by selling capitalist
bourgeois brands? ls that so?

584
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,635
Not the originals,
these are fake!

585
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,790
What? Denim-selling Muro,
market-seller Muro!

586
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,031
Faker-Muro, is that
how you imagine?

587
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,750
- Mr.Murat, care for some
stuffed eggplant? - No, l don't.

588
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,150
- l'll have some.
- Why don't you eat all of it Çetin?

589
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,720
Of course he won't eat.
This can't be eaten alone.

590
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:46,119
- Let's drink.
- l don't drink

591
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,555
- Come on, for me?
- Don't get me started with you!

592
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,792
- Chief, get out of the polemic.
- Okay, l will. l won't hit you.

593
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,953
Come on Muzo,
let's head up to the hotel.

594
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,076
The hotel you've just called!

595
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,839
No, wait a moment. We are
waiting to hear from the hotel.

596
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,079
Fidan, have a word with this villager.
He won't eat or drink anything.

597
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,870
He never listens to me.

598
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,430
Husband and wife have
cooperated to stuff me.

599
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,074
What am l, an eggplant?
Get up Muzo!

600
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,555
We should at least finish
up our drinks.

601
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,508
What are you up to?

602
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,309
Muro, are you slow in the head?

603
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,478
l couldn't have said that l'm calling
the women with Fidan around.

604
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,995
l've called the broads,
pretending to call the hotel.

605
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,636
Çetin, watch for Fidan.
Then why are you stalling me?

606
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,645
lt's closed. The phone is closed.

607
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,200
You don't know where
the workshop is?

608
00:42:41,235 --> 00:42:43,316
lt rings.

609
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:54,791
Honey, what's up? Good.

610
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,437
Darling, l'm going to call you.
Bye.

611
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,439
Sweetheart we need to get going.
Come on, come on get up.

612
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,389
What the heck?
What's happening to me?

613
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,720
A double would
not usually affect me.

614
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,233
Come, come, come...

615
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,598
- Çetin.
- Chief.

616
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,597
l need to throw up.

617
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,956
Bro what are you doing? There's
a human, not a cat lying in it.

618
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,072
- Chief? - Couldn't you find
another place to lie down?

619
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,925
No. We couldn't.

620
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,952
This is our hobby, lying down
the garbage bin in our free times.

621
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,515
Put this thing down, will you?

622
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,956
Damn you Muzo,
damn you Muzo!

623
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,036
No one can save
you from me now!

624
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,113
Çetin, call Yýldýrým and
tell him to pick us up.

625
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,517
Chief, we don't have a phone.
We're left in this deserted place.

626
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,033
What kind of words are these?
Damn it, damn it!

627
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:45,435
Friends, comrades, members
of the proletariat, wait for us.

628
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:54,789
You don't know but we are
facing a great conspiracy...

629
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,760
... could you take us to
somewhere appropriate?

630
00:44:56,795 --> 00:44:59,149
- Alright.
- Thank you very much.

631
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,839
So, what about your salaries?

632
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,554
Do you get overtime pay?
Are you in a union?

633
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,079
Don't get me started
with the Union!

634
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,869
We are driving this crap, while
they are driving a Mercedes..

635
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,590
- Damn it man, damn it!
- Chief, what do we do now?

636
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,478
We'll take the car and leave
Çetin. What else can we do?

637
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,245
We don't have the car keys.

638
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,872
Then convince it to
open the doors, Çetin.

639
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,718
- Pardon me?
- What a prick!

640
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,030
- Çetin convince the car by
hot-wiring... - l'll give it a try, Chief.

641
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,160
God damn you Muzo,
damn you!

642
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,077
You've left me in such a shit!
What are you looking at!

643
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,552
Damn!

644
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,157
Why would you lock the car Çetin,
who would want to steal it?

645
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,593
- Do you want to have fun?
- What do you mean by fun?

646
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,552
l've got very hot girls.

647
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,228
Where are the photos gone?

648
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:06,911
Look, we need two blondes with
blue eyes, Marsha and Daria, huh?

649
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,525
Do you know them?

650
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,836
l've got prettier, better girls!

651
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,440
Bro, you call yourself a pimp,
then act as a pimp as well.

652
00:46:14,475 --> 00:46:16,317
l want those ones,
can you get them for me?

653
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,034
But you're being too much, brother.
l wanted to make you a favor.

654
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,835
- Would a Chief like me, ask for
the favor of a pimp? - Chief!

655
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,434
Alright Çetin, l'm not attacking in
a polemic, l'm attacking the guy.

656
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,956
- Chief, not that, look ahead!
- What's happening there?

657
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,998
- We don't want, we are models, not
whores! - What models? You'll do...

658
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,111
- exactly as l tell you! Get in. - You
have a sister. Go get her to do it!

659
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,912
Stop talking and get in.
Take her in, will you?

660
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,245
- Hey, asshole!
- What the hell?

661
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,555
- Leave the girls alone.
- l'll kick your ass too!

662
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,631
- Shut up, dumbass!
- Oh God!

663
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,079
- Come here sweetie.
- What an asshole!

664
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,997
Honey, this man is bad.
He took our passports away.

665
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,125
Come sweetie.

666
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,594
Stop hugging the girl and take
the passports. Stop crying.

667
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,473
Çetin hurry up man, we should
leave before they come to themselves.

668
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,605
Okay.
Go, go, run!

669
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,110
- Come on girls, move it.
- Run sweetie, run!

670
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,550
This is the car, red one.

671
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,596
- lt smells awful!
- Çeto, what is this smell?

672
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,320
Don't ask, it's a long story.

673
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,550
Çetin, don't ever start
a polemic, be quiet.

674
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,116
Why are we here, if the
house is dangerous?

675
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,590
Honey, we have clothes at home.
Do you want us naked?

676
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,911
Honey, what is a piece of
cloth? We'll buy from a store.

677
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,040
What? Sorry Mr. Çetin,
l forgot, who were you again?

678
00:47:39,075 --> 00:47:41,349
Cotton trader? How are
you going to pay?

679
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,899
There's now a fake of everything.
We'll ask Muzo.

680
00:47:43,934 --> 00:47:46,238
Okay Çetin, stop chatting.
Come on you two, hurry up.

681
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,080
Thank you, you go.
You in danger.

682
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,748
Get in fast, get out fast.
We're waiting you here!

683
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,116
We're afraid of no one.

684
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,589
Chief, l'll help the girls.
ln case anything happens.

685
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,475
You're scared that the girls
will run away, aren't you?

686
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,717
Don't move for a minute, we
need to conduct an analysis!

687
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,280
Why don't we go up too?
We'll wash our hands, take a shower.

688
00:48:24,315 --> 00:48:26,430
Shower huh? Poser!

689
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,676
Chief, l swear l'm only
caring for your own good.

690
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,308
For your revolutionist balls.
What if they get an infection?

691
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,073
Speak of the good, Çetin!

692
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,005
Çetin, what do we do now?

693
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,634
How would l know? They are
stuck to us because of you!

694
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:49,795
l should've left the man to kill the
girls! Damn my love for humans!

695
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,597
Chief, when you say humans,
do you discriminate between genders?

696
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,678
Çetin, don't get on my
nerves speaking non-sense.

697
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,112
Call Yýldýrým, tell him to provide
us with logistic support.

698
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,670
- OK, l'll get Olga's phone.
- You'll get it when she comes back.

699
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,760
Dicks, they are coming here.
They called our friend.

700
00:49:08,795 --> 00:49:10,085
Çeto, let's go quick.

701
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,872
Honey, will you hand over
the phone for a minute?

702
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,831
But we are in no
position to run away!

703
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,285
You'll be running very
hard with this Lada!

704
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:20,518
What? Lada is your father! Do you
always have to go wrong with me?

705
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,551
Don't you see,
this is the Hadji Muro.

706
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,553
- Hello. Yýldýrým!
- Get in the car!

707
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:33,115
Where are you? We
need logistic support, urgently.

708
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,480
Çetin, are you sure
this is the right way?

709
00:49:39,515 --> 00:49:41,160
Chief, Yýldýrým told us to turn left.

710
00:49:41,195 --> 00:49:42,673
So we have.

711
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,674
Chief...

712
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:50,119
- We found Yýldýrým.
- Come on Chief.

713
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:59,471
Drive straight.
Closer, closer.

714
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,918
Welcome Chief.

715
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,549
We're welcome Yýldýrým,
we're welcome.

716
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,636
Chief, did you pick up these
sisters from the village?

717
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,916
Yes, Yýldýrým they are from
the village. Liked them?

718
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:23,159
Stop talking silly and jarring on
my nerves! Prepare the tea for us!

719
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,271
On your order, Chief.

720
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,352
Çetin, get your things,
we are leaving.

721
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,952
Çeto, pool!
l like swimming very much.

722
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,472
Anna this is a great pool.
We'll swim and sunbathe.

723
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,434
- Do you think they own the house?
- l don't know, maybe. Who cares?

724
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,953
Chief, where do we head to?

725
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,837
l don't know Çetin,
we'll figure out some place.

726
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,199
Chief, let's stay tonight.
We'll find Muzo in the morning...

727
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:09,479
... get it in the open and then
we'll go where ever you show.

728
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,605
Damn you Çetin, l just
couldn't tame your capitalist soul.

729
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,675
You made a favor, so you want
to get your share at night, right?

730
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:18,711
That's not the issue, Chief.
l believe Anna has feelings for you.

731
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:21,519
And you should clean up or
else it will get an infection!

732
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,075
Thank you for your orders
Doctor Çetin!

733
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,714
- Yýldýrým! - Yes Chief?
- Show me the bathroom.

734
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,395
Follow me Chief. This way.

735
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,713
- What?
- Chief...

736
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,998
- What is it Yýldýrým?
- Chief, l think these will suit you.

737
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,469
- Yýldýrým, what's that?
- Jeans.

738
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,631
Have you ever seen
me wearing jeans?

739
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,872
Chief, you are not on the mountain;
you'll not be working on the ground.

740
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,038
l thought you'd be
comfortable in them?

741
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,919
Yýldýrým, l won't wear it.

742
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:13,752
- Chief. - What?
- l brought your tea.

743
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,514
- Where is Çetin?
- He's showing Olga the room.

744
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,678
What a dog!

745
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,479
Yýldýrým, keep Çetin close that he
won't step on a mine or something.

746
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,152
Yes Chief.

747
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,068
What is this?

748
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,459
l need to apply ice.

749
00:52:39,494 --> 00:52:41,758
No, no; it's okay.

750
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,350
What are you looking at?

751
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,912
Honey, you look a lot
like Antonio Banderas!

752
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,593
Who is he? A red?

753
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,555
No, an actor, l like him very much.
He's you with long hair, without beard.

754
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,711
You are like twins.

755
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,031
A revolutionist can not compare
or be compared with another man.

756
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,511
Compare me to Marx, to Lenin;
but not to Hollywood yuppies.

757
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,836
Yýldýrým made me wear these.

758
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:16,554
- Honey, you're so tense?
- lt must be of the wind of the pool.

759
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,833
- Come Honey. - To where?
- Come.

760
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,354
You must be tired
and sleepy, right?

761
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,910
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

762
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,911
l am expressing my gratitude.

763
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,639
No, no!
Don't express me your gratitude.

764
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,870
l'm not waiting for a return.

765
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:57,039
- l want you.
- Thank you, may cosmos bless you.

766
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:01,831
l want you too, let's accept it.
But if l go for it...

767
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,276
... l'll be betraying myself,
and betraying revolution.

768
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,720
- Why? - Because a revolutionist
would never expect...

769
00:54:09,755 --> 00:54:12,917
... a favor in return of a
favor he has done.

770
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:20,674
That son of a widow,
is still an intern revolutionist!

771
00:54:20,709 --> 00:54:24,308
Not a full revolutionist!
l'll go and have a look.

772
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,355
Çeto don't!
You've broken the bed.

773
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,233
lt's better than my pride being broken.
Do you want me to be Chief's joke?

774
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,314
You are crazy!
lt's normal due to over excitement.

775
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,960
You say it's normal but
how'll l explain to my Chief...

776
00:54:43,995 --> 00:54:46,838
... that a revolutionist
became excited?

777
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,953
That's enough. Honey, l'm going
downstairs, do you need anything?

778
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,838
l'm good, honey.

779
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,476
Look, don't think of
sleeping until l get back.

780
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,751
Alright, honey.

781
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,360
Chief Çetin, l was thinking that
maybe l need a girlfriend too.

782
00:55:26,395 --> 00:55:27,759
lt's early for you.

783
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,478
No Muro?

784
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,755
- Chief is gone but he's
coming back. - To where?

785
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,876
- To Muzo. - Why are
you telling me this now?

786
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,445
But you haven't asked,
Chief Çetin.

787
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,040
How would l know? l thought
he was sleeping with sister Anna!

788
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,965
Muro didn't stay in my room.

789
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,595
This time Chief's so stressed
that he'll definitely kill Muzo.

790
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,285
- ls Muzo inside?
- He waits for you.

791
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:58,108
For who? Where do you find the
chutzpah to talk to me like that?

792
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,236
You are a secretary,
so act like one.

793
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,919
Muro, what was that scene you
made last night? Does it befit you?

794
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,605
What are you talking about?

795
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,029
You've soiled my
reputation in lstanbul.

796
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,952
What was that number
you pulled in the hotel?

797
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,833
Which hotel, which scene?

798
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,513
Harassing women,
cursing, goosing...

799
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,245
What the heck?

800
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,714
l've put you in your rooms
with my own hands.

801
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,518
Why did you leave your
rooms and yell...

802
00:56:28,553 --> 00:56:30,117
... ''we want women,
we want women!''?

803
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,396
What did you pour
into our drinks?

804
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,632
Muro, you can't drink
decently and you foul my name.

805
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:39,037
By the way, the women said
that they'd never get near you...

806
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,997
... leave alone divorcing.

807
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,118
Call the women and we'll ask them
whether or not l'd done such things?

808
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,236
l don't have the face
to call anyone!

809
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,079
l'll take your face and...
And...

810
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,680
Do you want me to kill you!
You conspirator, comprador, spy!

811
00:56:52,715 --> 00:56:54,159
Help, help, police, police!

812
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,590
So, were you demanding tribute payment
within the knowledge of organization?

813
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,917
What the heck? Are we
speaking the same language?

814
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,805
Why can't l make my point?

815
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,480
No, no you do make your point.
You just get out ofjail.

816
00:57:07,515 --> 00:57:10,392
Come to Aksaray...
Hot chicks...

817
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,439
Once you taste, you want the rest
but you don't have the money, right?

818
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,029
So you go and bully others.

819
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,634
- Bravo inspector.
- Bravo inspector, l congratulate you.

820
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,669
Your analysis gets as good as it
gets. Let me make an analysis.

821
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,594
Let's call Muzo's wife Fidan; if
she confirms her husband's story...

822
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,512
... then l'm willing to be hung!

823
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,605
What does my wife
have to do with it?

824
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,920
You take me to your home by force, you
fed me by force, you had me drinking.

825
00:57:36,955 --> 00:57:38,605
Fidan is my only witness.

826
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:42,520
Would you take me to your home,
if l was the one threatening you?

827
00:57:42,555 --> 00:57:45,080
Muro is resorting to demagogy,
to cover up his crime.

828
00:57:45,115 --> 00:57:46,560
l'm not asking something
difficult to achieve...

829
00:57:46,595 --> 00:57:48,437
... call her so that she can testify.

830
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,359
- Call her.
- Bravo inspector.

831
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:55,917
Bravo, inspector.
You take a bandit's word...

832
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:59,868
... for the word of a
reputable tax payer like me!

833
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:04,437
A state which relies on
the words of a bandit, then...

834
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,160
... l'm withdrawing my complaint.

835
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,685
Who's withdrawing what?

836
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,438
l have a complaint
against this tax-payer...

837
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,476
... who became the slave
of vulgar capitalism!

838
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,240
Alright, alright, stop
shouting slogans.

839
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,433
lf l see you in Aksaray again,
l'll commit you in prison.

840
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,245
This is my last warning!

841
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,590
ls he -the capitalist conspirator-
going to get away with this?

842
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,360
But, these insults are unnecessary.

843
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,280
- You counterfeit!
- God!

844
00:58:30,315 --> 00:58:32,005
Take Muro in!

845
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,508
Of course,
everybody strikes Muro!

846
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,113
Call a cab, Çetin, right away.

847
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:48,874
- Are we going home, Chief?
- Not home, we're going to kill Muzo!

848
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,793
Chief, the inspector said he
didn't want to see you in Aksaray.

849
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,605
Do you have to kill Muzo
right at this minute?

850
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,560
l don't have to Çetin,
it's the order of the cosmos.

851
00:58:55,595 --> 00:58:58,279
Taxi! Hey mate,
what are you doing?

852
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,245
What is it Yýldýrým?
Where are you?

853
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,874
- Who are you talking to?
- Yýldýrým is calling. - Alright.

854
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,956
Damn it, l'm sure
she's hiding in the house.

855
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:15,725
Chief, why would sister
Fidan be hiding?

856
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,320
Çetin, damn well you wouldn't show
your face with a husband like that.

857
00:59:18,355 --> 00:59:19,799
Get out of the way!

858
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,874
Damn Muzo, damn you.

859
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,878
The cops will bust us,
and we'll get arrested.

860
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,237
- l don't care if the president
comes! Muzo! - Chief, don't!

861
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,165
Chief, don't you see he's gone?

862
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,236
We'll be in prison for another 30
years in the cause of your obsession.

863
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,356
l won't be sure without
checking all rooms!

864
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,912
Damn you Muzo, damn you!
Where the heck is this guy?

865
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,157
- l don't know Chief.
- The cops! Move!

866
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,919
Where do you think?

867
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,037
We're heading home to make
tactical and strategic analysis.

868
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,594
- What about Taksim?
- Çetin, what about Taksim?

869
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:34,874
We should analyze
among common people.

870
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,313
What will we do in Taksim?

871
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,834
Chief, the girls are bored at home,
Yýldýrým didn't show them around.

872
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,833
l'm talking about tactics, strategies
and you're talking about broads!

873
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,309
Chief, sister Anna wanted to
get you a gift of gratitude.

874
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:47,029
- Which gratitude? - You saved
her life, Chief. Don't underestimate.

875
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,952
We shouldn't overestimate
these issues, Çetin.

876
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,879
You know we walk side by side
our oppressed people all the time.

877
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,597
- Where were they? - Yýldýrým said,
take a turn from the doner shops.

878
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:23,120
ls there another place to turn?
You've jumbled me with the crowd.

879
01:01:23,155 --> 01:01:24,235
Why, Chief?

880
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,000
l wanted the people of our
noble nation to see their leaders.

881
01:01:27,035 --> 01:01:28,479
- That's what l've reckoned.
- Don't reckon that.

882
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,480
Do you think our people see
anything but bourgeois...

883
01:01:30,515 --> 01:01:32,869
... imperialist, capitalist signs?
What leader?

884
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,792
Çetin, why don't
you call Yýldýrým?

885
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,640
l believe we're almost there
Chief, no need to call.

886
01:01:40,675 --> 01:01:43,029
Almost where?
Where are we going?

887
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:48,115
Chief, are you hungry?
l swear l'm starving like a dog.

888
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,153
Çetin, at which of these capitalist
shops do you want to eat?

889
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:56,388
Why would a human being
want to eat in here?

890
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,591
Çetin!

891
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:00,989
Çetin!

892
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,036
Why are you grinning, Çetin?

893
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,397
Honey, welcome!

894
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:19,478
Honey, the bikini is
very nice, thank you!

895
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,869
What the heck?
Where is the other half of it?

896
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,953
Couldn't you find another place
to eat in the whole lstanbul?

897
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,518
l like potatoes here, Chief.

898
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,949
Really? l'm fond of
the potatoes of Niðde.

899
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,445
But l don't go all the
way to Niðde, do l?

900
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,632
- Honey, for me?
- For you? For you, l'd do any...

901
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,799
What are you looking at? l've
got a headache, hand me a pill.

902
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,912
- Olga, you got painkillers?
- Yes honey.

903
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,314
l'm only having fries to avoid
pill's perforating my stomach.

904
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:51,072
Chief, do you mind trying
the fries with mustard?

905
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,599
How do you know
about mustard, Çetin?

906
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:55,670
You're hurting my feelings.

907
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,638
You think poised hammer
is dropping only rifles.

908
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:01,638
Why, they drop mustards,
mayonnaise, ketchup.

909
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:02,830
Çetuþka...

910
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,485
Do you wonder
about poised hammer?

911
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,318
Let my Chief explain it to you.
Please go on, my fair Chief.

912
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,796
Poised hammer is the hammer
that gives with a spoon...

913
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,360
... but takes away
with a bucket.

914
01:03:11,395 --> 01:03:13,271
Such as lMF!
Such as NATO!

915
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,920
Çetuþka, what have you done,
giving the wrong pill to Chief?

916
01:03:16,955 --> 01:03:17,989
He'll be fine.

917
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:21,271
He will be fine? Honey,
Chief popped the X!

918
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,351
He needs disco, needs to
get it out of his system!

919
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,238
Why didn't you tell it before?

920
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,917
- l'm familiar with...
- Brother, how much?

921
01:03:27,952 --> 01:03:30,234
Can't you read, bro?
Prices are written here.

922
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,278
Not those, the broads?

923
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,677
- Come again? - How much
do you want for these broads?

924
01:03:35,712 --> 01:03:38,995
l'll take you down! Yýldýrým,
bite his ear, Yýldýrým.

925
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,952
l'm going to kill you!

926
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:48,040
Damn Çetin, if capitalism makes
a man a pimp in the first...

927
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:50,759
... and only try think
about the second.

928
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,716
Çetin, what's happening to me?

929
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,595
Damn Çetin, my body is on fire,
is it the fries of that damned place?

930
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,268
Chief, perhaps negative energy
has accumulated within our bodies.

931
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,313
We should discharge it. Perhaps
we should go some place?

932
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,231
You're right,
let's go and waste Muzo.

933
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,675
Where can that capitalist,
bourgeois, comprador be?

934
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,589
- How about the disco Chief?
- What do you mean by disco?

935
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:19,112
Reina, Sortie and a variety of
other discos by the Bosphorus.

936
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:24,673
Çetuþka, we go to Reina, l want
to see it very badly. Thank you.

937
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:28,116
My honeybunny, don't thank
me sweetie, thank the Chief.

938
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,477
- Chief, thank you, Reina.
- Çetin, what's she saying?

939
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:35,468
Your analysis was a success, Chief.
Muzo must certainly be in Reina.

940
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:41,152
- Honey, did you like my gift?
- Chief, a classical ltalian cut.

941
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,839
Yýldýrým, your father was an ltalian
but l couldn't remember your mother!

942
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,230
We're not going to any discos.
No one is leaving anywhere.

943
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,605
Don't move.
Don't drink.

944
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,677
- You are a bad man!
- Don't push me, l'm stressed.

945
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,950
Damn Çetin, what's
wrong with me?

946
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:56,071
Chief, l think we
need to jump around.

947
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,595
Çetin, it is as if l have
another Muro inside me...

948
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,405
... who wants to run
through the hills.

949
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,431
- l feel like l want to kiss
you all. - Disco?

950
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,760
Damn Çetin, people will reckon
you were born in a disco, you hick.

951
01:05:05,795 --> 01:05:07,400
Has your father ever
seen a disco in his life?

952
01:05:07,435 --> 01:05:08,605
You're hurting my feelings, Chief.

953
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:11,438
My dad went to ''tanz-dancing'' during
his days as a worker in Germany.

954
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:14,438
He also had first place in
twisting and a medal for it.

955
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,631
Why don't you carry the medal
around your neck then?

956
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,070
l won't step a foot in a
disco unless l'm dead.

957
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:49,578
lsn't this nice? We're introducing
the girls with our own culture.

958
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:52,637
Haven't we started halay too fast?
What if we run out of breath?

959
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:57,111
Don't cop out, Çetin. Keep halay going
and revolution running. Come on!

960
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:37,120
Come on Çetin, keep going.

961
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:53,000
Mates, l beg you,
play another song!

962
01:06:53,035 --> 01:06:54,228
We are exhausted, bro!

963
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:57,432
l'm usually nothing like this,
but today l have an extra to me.

964
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,431
Çetin, Yýldýrým, come here.

965
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,799
l'm the Chief, l'm calling
you here. Girls, you too?

966
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,913
You're playing?

967
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,594
l swear l love you so much
that l'll kiss you one by one.

968
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,794
Come on Yýldýrým, come on!

969
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,838
- Chief?
- What?

970
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,429
The dawn is breaking,
shouldn't we head home?

971
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,557
You'd be jumping till the morning
if we were in Layla, Reina, right?

972
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,359
lf l don't discharge my
energy when we get home...

973
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:43,680
... if my head keeps turning; then
l will have you dancing the halay...

974
01:07:43,715 --> 01:07:45,432
... inside the pool until morning!

975
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:58,436
Come on Çetin, come on!
Keep the pace!

976
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,352
Chief, l swear, l'm finished.

977
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,556
You're still talking Çetin,
so you can't be finished.

978
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:08,589
- Çetin, damn you, get up!
- Chief, l swear l'm worn out.

979
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,245
Yýldýrým, take him away.

980
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:12,032
l don't need an offbeat
comrade dancing with me!

981
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,272
- Good night Chief...
- Good night Olga!

982
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,878
Anna, come here l'll show
you our folk dance.

983
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,589
- l sleep, Muro. - Why do you
sleep now? Come next to me.

984
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,079
l am too tired.

985
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,276
Give me a kiss.
Come on.

986
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,874
Honey...
See, it's very simple.

987
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,076
You take two steps to the
right and one to the left.

988
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,599
Got it? Come on.

989
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:39,275
One two three...
One two three...

990
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:42,513
Good for you! l'm showing
you the spine of halay, now.

991
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:44,517
You hit, then you jump.

992
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,280
Muro, l'm tired, l'm not coming.

993
01:08:56,315 --> 01:08:57,998
Swimming in the morning.

994
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,593
Muro...

995
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,560
Honey, l sweated like a pig.
l don't want to smell next to you.

996
01:09:57,595 --> 01:09:59,335
Should l get a shower?

997
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:01,076
No, honey l like sweat.

998
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,236
You used to nag at
my head for showering.

999
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,356
No, honey, l like your smell.

1000
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,351
Of course you do, once you've
smelled a revolutionist...

1001
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:10,159
- ... you'll never forget.
- You are bad.

1002
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,595
Okay girl. l like the way
you smell, too.

1003
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:15,240
Armani, l like very much.

1004
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,994
Why are you putting a third
man in a double bed?

1005
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,645
- Anna?
- Honey?

1006
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:28,433
- Are you asleep?
- No.

1007
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,158
So, why are you quiet?

1008
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,925
What do you want?
You want me to talk?

1009
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:35,400
- Talk and l'll listen. - What do
you want me to talk about?

1010
01:10:35,435 --> 01:10:39,234
Tell me about the revolution,
the great leader Lenin.

1011
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,033
- Lenin?
- Yes Lenin, Vlademir llyich Lenin.

1012
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,951
Lenin is a total dick!

1013
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,554
Watch your language, woman!
Am l cursing at your father?

1014
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,720
- Lenin, your father?
- Lenin is my father.

1015
01:10:48,755 --> 01:10:50,870
Lenin is the father of all reds.

1016
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:54,874
- Lenin is not my father.
- Who's your father? Bush?

1017
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,669
- Good night Chief.
- Good night Çetin.

1018
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:27,434
- Cal-vin, Calvin Klein!
- Chief?

1019
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,956
Keep imperialism away from the
cleavage, Çetin. Leave it alone!

1020
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,398
Okay.

1021
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:43,955
- No! We're busted!
- Yýldýrým!

1022
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:56,074
- Chief! We are busted!
- Yýldýrým, why panic?

1023
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,040
The worse that can happen
will be to get arrested!

1024
01:11:58,075 --> 01:11:59,473
Chief, the landlord is here!

1025
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:03,673
What? But you said they were
gone for three months! Çetin!

1026
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,391
Çetin!

1027
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:23,873
Anna! Anna!
Anna wake up!

1028
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,914
We'll do it in the morning Muro,
l'm very tired.

1029
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,992
Do what? Get up, dress up.
We're leaving. We are busted.

1030
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,870
Who are you? Who is there?

1031
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,845
Where are you Yýldýrým?

1032
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:40,245
Sir, what are you doing here?

1033
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:42,714
Stop talking, now.
Open the door.

1034
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:46,469
Sir, when you were gone, l've
sprayed insecticide the whole house.

1035
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,710
You'll get poisoned.

1036
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,592
Open the door.

1037
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,557
Where have you been?

1038
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,309
Come in Sir.
Welcome Madam.

1039
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,599
At least go and get
our luggage from the car.

1040
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,233
Okay sir.

1041
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,633
Who are you?
This is rudeness!

1042
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,278
Collaborative comprador friend
is asking you a question, Çetin.

1043
01:13:21,313 --> 01:13:23,756
Hillbillies! You didn't set a
scarecrow, you've set a watch...

1044
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,476
... you should've given
the guy a heads up...

1045
01:13:26,511 --> 01:13:29,113
... so that we can take
our position accordingly.

1046
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,472
lf we were to make the revolution,
then this is the time!

1047
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:54,319
l swear l've had it with this
miserable proletariat life.

1048
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,950
Çetuþka, who were
those people?

1049
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,840
Sweetie, they are my cousins.

1050
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:03,565
We were at odds with them.

1051
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,431
The house belongs to us,
but those squatters occupied it.

1052
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,918
We didn't make a scene
because of you.

1053
01:14:07,953 --> 01:14:10,237
Otherwise, l'd choked
them to death.

1054
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,836
Çetin, do you have other
bourgeois cousins in lstanbul?

1055
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,600
Why don't you call them
and inform that we're coming.

1056
01:14:15,635 --> 01:14:17,318
Lying poser!

1057
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:21,476
Yýldýrým, you've tarnished
my revolutionist charisma.

1058
01:14:21,511 --> 01:14:24,592
Chief, why are you hitting me?
l've already lost my job.

1059
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,390
- Where are we going?
- Where do you want to go?

1060
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,795
l don't know.

1061
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,080
l've got friends alright;
but it'd be rude to knock...

1062
01:14:35,115 --> 01:14:36,638
... at their doors at this hour.

1063
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,035
l'd suggest going
to a hotel, but...

1064
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:44,751
We have a friend, Natalie, she
is a great girl, let's go to her place.

1065
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:48,515
What will we do in a stranger's
house at this hour?

1066
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:58,070
- Sister, is Natalie single?
- Single.

1067
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:10,998
- Hi.
- Hi.

1068
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:20,988
- Hi. - Hi.
- Hi.

1069
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:25,790
Good night, girl.
l'm Yýldýrým.

1070
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,953
Chief!

1071
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:33,153
- Yýldýrým!
- Coming, Chief.

1072
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,908
Get inside, we're coming.

1073
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:44,550
Where were you?
l was worried sick.

1074
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:47,115
- We've been through so much.
- Who are they?

1075
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,675
We'll tell you,
it's a long story.

1076
01:15:56,160 --> 01:16:01,792
She's old but in good shape.
Chief, who is this Natalie?

1077
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,150
My second cousin.
How would l know Yýldýrým?

1078
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,396
My eyes are picking
her up from before.

1079
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,672
Your eyes are hungry dogs,
picking up everything on the way.

1080
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:16,156
Miss Natali, forgive us
for coming at this hour.

1081
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,311
But we'll leave
early in the morning.

1082
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,273
No problem, honey.
l'm familiar with having guests.

1083
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:27,109
- How familiar? - Yýldýrým,
don't make me tie you here.

1084
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:32,790
Çeto, let's go to bed,
l'm exhausted.

1085
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,975
Chief, we're really exhausted,
let's go to bed...

1086
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:36,991
... and we'll make a sound
analysis in the morning.

1087
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:40,880
Good night to you all! Miss
Natali, care to show our room?

1088
01:16:40,915 --> 01:16:43,269
Of course.

1089
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,474
Goodnight Chief.

1090
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:16,030
There is Muzo.

1091
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,916
Hello, Chief?

1092
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,832
Hi father.

1093
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,276
What have l told you?
You'll peak Turkish, speak Turkish.

1094
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:31,678
- Eat my wiener.
- What? - Eat my wiener.

1095
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,269
Get over there, go!

1096
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,998
Bro, come in.

1097
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,834
- Yýldýrým, what's that?
- Chief.

1098
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,316
- Are you sure he was him?
- Yes, Chief, it was Muzo.

1099
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:53,080
Yýldýrým, then head for the
home and wait with the girls.

1100
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,709
lt can take long. l don't
know when we'll be back.

1101
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,233
Yes Chief.

1102
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:00,016
This kid is weird in someway,
but l couldn't figure out how.

1103
01:18:00,051 --> 01:18:02,632
Chief, l want to tell you something.
Olga proposed to me.

1104
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:06,719
- What? Do women propose
nowadays? - l've said yes.

1105
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,837
What? Çetin, what are
you saying? Çetin?

1106
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,837
- Hello, the beautiful person
of the cold country. - Hello.

1107
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,595
- ls Mr. Muzaffer here?
- Yes he is, come in. - Thank you.

1108
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,885
Does this psycho have
a problem with me?

1109
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:25,593
- Well, Chief, the women love me.
- We will have our talk later, Çetin.

1110
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:31,438
- Brother Muzaffer, how are you?
- Where have you been?

1111
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,598
Kid! Put the gun down,
cosmos will load it!

1112
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,800
Çetin, take the
bastard to his mother.

1113
01:18:36,835 --> 01:18:38,677
Come, dear.

1114
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,633
You've fallen into
my hands, Muzo.

1115
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:48,392
Okay Muro, l spoke with the
girls, they agreed to divorce you.

1116
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,835
They'll come through
this door in a moment.

1117
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:56,319
Alright then. l'll close my
eyes and count to three.

1118
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:00,951
When l open them, l want to
see two women ready to divorce.

1119
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,759
Otherwise you are a dead man.

1120
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,111
- One...
- Chief!

1121
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:15,159
Çetin, we'll talk about that
issue later. Two...

1122
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:19,956
- Chief! - Çetin, it is not the
time to argue. Two and a half...

1123
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:23,377
- But Chief! - Çetin, forget
about the marriage. Three!

1124
01:19:23,412 --> 01:19:26,594
- Chief, for God's sake, open
your eyes! - What the heck?

1125
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,279
- l'll shoot you!
- Shoot!

1126
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,113
- l swear l'll shoot you.
- You should!

1127
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:02,005
Muro...

1128
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:05,635
What? Muro Muro Muro.
l've had it with you for 35 years!

1129
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:09,273
Brother Muzaffer, why don't
you tell where the women are?

1130
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:14,269
Muro, you'll look after
my family from now on.

1131
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:18,680
You bastard, if you die,
l swear l'll take care of...

1132
01:20:18,715 --> 01:20:22,275
... all generations of
your family. Come on.

1133
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,430
Chief, how do we
get to divorce now?

1134
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,877
Damn you Çetin, don't
mess with my head...

1135
01:20:36,912 --> 01:20:39,154
... or the next bullet
is coming to you.

1136
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:44,390
- Brother Muzaffer, are you dead?
- Çetin!

1137
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:52,677
Çetin, get a cab to home.
l have some business.

1138
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,109
- Where are you going, Chief?
- l said l have business.

1139
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,794
Cross your heart Natalie,
you have a fortune!

1140
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,110
Fortune?
Love, money, which one?

1141
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:05,274
Not only love but also blind love.
His name starts with a ''Y''.

1142
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:08,756
- Yaþar?
- What Yaþar? Who is Yaþar?

1143
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:12,310
- Yaþar the waiter.
- Never mind Yaþar the waiter.

1144
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,755
- Yaþar does not have an ''l''.
- This one's got an ''l'' in it. - l...

1145
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:18,157
And one other thing.
l see a wedding.

1146
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,118
Yýldýrým, you compadan,
how did you know?

1147
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,158
- Really?
- Çeto and l are getting married!

1148
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,754
Getting married, how?

1149
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,445
Honey, Cetuska got down
on his knees and said...

1150
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:33,235
... ''Honey, l love you so much.
l don't want to live without you.

1151
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,870
... Will you marry me?''
Look, here's the ring.

1152
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,551
Why aren't you happy Yýldýrým?

1153
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:46,958
But sister, Chief Çeto and
Chief Muro are already married.

1154
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:00,311
- You liar! Sneaky!
- Wait. What happened?

1155
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:04,645
You are a big liar, shame on you.
Take your ring.

1156
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:08,309
- Give it to your wife. - l swear
it's not true. l'm not married.

1157
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:11,557
- ls Yýldýrým lying?
- Damn Yýldýrým, l'll kill you.

1158
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:14,760
Has Yýldýrým also told you that
this was a fake marriage?

1159
01:22:14,795 --> 01:22:17,400
l've never even seen those
women once in my life.

1160
01:22:17,435 --> 01:22:20,417
You are lying.
You don't love me.

1161
01:22:20,452 --> 01:22:23,365
Sweetie, l'm not lying to you.

1162
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,834
l may have forgotten to tell
you some parts of my life.

1163
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,316
- Go! - l won't go!
Kill me if you want.

1164
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:33,359
l can't be without you.
Come on, stop being stubborn.

1165
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,511
Give me a hug.
Come here.

1166
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:43,438
Are you mad at me!
Give me a kiss, let's make it up.

1167
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,639
Mr. Murat, what
brings you here?

1168
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:17,830
Fidan, l shot Muzo.

1169
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,509
Why didn't you shoot
him 20 years before?

1170
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:24,518
What's the point? Why do
you bring back old issues?

1171
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:27,280
Did you shoot him to marry me?

1172
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:31,234
Fidan, don't talk nonsense. Why
did you marry Muzo if you loved me?

1173
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,510
l wouldn't have married
him if you were into me.

1174
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,995
You were so into the revolutionary
path, you didn't realize me.

1175
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:38,754
l'm still following that path.

1176
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,396
l'm going to the mountains.

1177
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,594
Will you leave me in the lurch?

1178
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,873
Fidan...

1179
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:53,674
l won't let people say l
shot Muzo to get his wife.

1180
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,475
l'm sorry.

1181
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:21,557
- Priviyet.
- Priviyet yourself!

1182
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:38,598
Chief, Natali and l were
looking through the album.

1183
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:44,278
Drop the album. Tell Çetin
to get ready, we're leaving.

1184
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:13,991
Have you been crying?

1185
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:16,873
Why didn't you tell me
you were married?

1186
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:21,631
- Why would l?
- l wish you did.

1187
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,549
Never mind. lt doesn't
mean anything now.

1188
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:30,959
- Why?
- l'm going back.

1189
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:33,509
- Where?
- Mountains.

1190
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:39,111
- ls it because Muzo died?
- Did Çetin tell you that?

1191
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:47,473
Muro, let's go to Kiev.
No one will find you there.

1192
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:52,276
- What will l do in Kiev?
- Come with me Muro.

1193
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:59,031
lt all ends here.

1194
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,233
- Are you ready Çetin?
- No Chief.

1195
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,550
l've told you to pack.

1196
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:03,789
Didn't you hear Çetin,
we are leaving!

1197
01:27:03,880 --> 01:27:06,030
Chief, forgive me.
l can't come.

1198
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:10,239
What? What will you do
if you are not coming?

1199
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,590
l'm going to stay here, Chief.

1200
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,951
Who will keep you alive,
state or the organization?

1201
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:18,276
Like we have the chance of
surviving in the mountains.

1202
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:20,590
Çetin, don't spark a polemic.

1203
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:26,350
Say your goodbyes, let's go
out of here as soon as possible.

1204
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,709
Chief, l can't live without Olga.

1205
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,725
Who will keep you
alive here with Olga?

1206
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,955
lt doesn't matter.
l'll live even for a day.

1207
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:38,432
Çetin, what about our ideals,
our people, revolution?

1208
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:42,679
Chief, l don't care about the
revolution or the ideals without you.

1209
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,030
l believed in them
because of you.

1210
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,960
And you are abandoning your
Chief, who made you believe?

1211
01:27:47,995 --> 01:27:50,765
Don't get me wrong Chief
but mountains are not the...

1212
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,597
- ... place for solution.
- You're living in a dream, Çetin.

1213
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,360
When you wake up, Yýldýrým
won't be there, l won't be there.

1214
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:57,232
Olga will be gone for long.

1215
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:01,229
l don't want to wake up
from the dream, Chief.

1216
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,796
Çetin!

1217
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:10,913
Chief, stop.

1218
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,431
- Chief!
- Chief!

1219
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:29,635
- Yýldýrým! - Chief!
- Çetin! - Chief!

1220
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:34,829
Damn it, l had taken
the bastard's gun.

1221
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:52,835
- Çeto, weren't you convincing
the Chief? - l did, Olga.

1222
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,792
Convince who?

1223
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,276
Çeto said, ''Olga wait,
l'll talk to the Chief and...

1224
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,396
- ... convince him not to leave.''
- When?

1225
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:03,034
Chief, were you really
going to leave me?

1226
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,405
Yýldýrým already stirred
up trouble today.

1227
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,273
Chief Çetin, look at what
you did in my happiest day?

1228
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:09,998
Why are you happy?

1229
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:13,510
Chief, Natalie said...

1230
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,148
... she was going to fix
me up with one of them.

1231
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,200
You hick, l swear, poor woman
will bring the whole Russian...

1232
01:29:19,235 --> 01:29:20,765
... nation to get rid off you.

1233
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,360
Chief, if you give your
blessings, than it is on.

1234
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,232
- Natalie, are these your friends?
- Yes.

1235
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:34,273
- Are they living in lstanbul?
- Yes.

1236
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:37,352
- Which one of them is
for Yýldýrým? - Neither one.

1237
01:29:37,520 --> 01:29:39,245
Why Chief?

1238
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:42,113
Because one of them is my and
the other one is Çetin's wife.

1239
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,635
Come on, let's get going.

1240
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,360
Chief, l'm afraid these women will
get scared and not divorce us.

1241
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:03,113
Either they divorce us willingly,
or we become widowers.

1242
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:04,725
Chief, violence is not the solution.

1243
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:06,955
l'm telling you l'm not
setting foot in the prison again.

1244
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:08,245
Let's solve our
problems by talking.

1245
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:10,635
- Okay Çetin, you are in command.
- Thank you Chief.

1246
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,392
You're welcome Çetin.

1247
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,229
- Eat my wiener!
- What?

1248
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,750
- Çetin?
- Chief?

1249
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:25,593
Damn Muzo!

1250
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:31,956
Yýldýrým, get me the rifle!
Damn you Muzo!

1251
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:37,272
Yýldýrým, take the door.

1252
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:47,314
Çetin, hold this.

1253
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:53,157
- Muzo? - Muro?
Where have you been?

1254
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:56,630
Come in, l've found your women.
l was waiting for you, come in.

1255
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,405
You counterfeit!

1256
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:00,556
You've found them five years
ago, the bastard shows his age.

1257
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:02,398
- Are you still denying?
- God!

1258
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,949
Take this Çetin.
Muzo!

1259
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,229
Which one of you is my wife?

1260
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:13,076
Aren't you ashamed of
marrying a strange man, traitors?

1261
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,876
Muzo!
You are dead.

1262
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,156
Çetin, give me the piece.

1263
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,119
Get out of the way.

1264
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,595
Chief, if l'm in command,
we are not killing anyone.

1265
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:36,478
Shut it about commanding!

1266
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:38,319
Girls, don't panic.

1267
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:41,876
Chief has always assigned me on
door duty in these types of operations.

1268
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:47,392
Damn you Muzo, damn you!

1269
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:50,518
The guy has married us to his
mistresses, he is still playing with us.

1270
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:51,829
Open it!

1271
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:55,748
Don't call them mistresses,
they are your sisters-in-law.

1272
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:59,833
My sister is actually my wife,
so she is your sister-in-law!

1273
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:03,596
Who else could I rely on but you?

1274
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:05,640
A man can't find a man
of honor in these days!

1275
01:32:05,675 --> 01:32:08,598
Shut up! Go get the
crowbar from the car!

1276
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:10,238
I won't leave, you'll kill the man.

1277
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,548
Of course I will.
What else would I do?

1278
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:15,030
If you don't have mercy on me,
mercy on my two babies!

1279
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:16,952
Open the damn thing.

1280
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:19,711
I've had enough of you.

1281
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,959
Muro, that's entirely your fault!

1282
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:27,635
If you'd married Fidan
I would be better than this!

1283
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,645
Shut up!

1284
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:32,752
Chief, brother Muzaffer is right,
sister Çýnar could not bear children.

1285
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:35,673
Çetin, stop chattering,
don't make me smash you too!

1286
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,273
God!

1287
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:43,840
Should I kill you now?

1288
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:47,669
You are a lowlife,
shameless disgrace!

1289
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:51,430
- Stop, leave the man!
- Leave the man. - Not you again!

1290
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,150
For God's sake,
you are just on time.

1291
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:58,478
Otherwise Chief would kill Muzaffer,
you have saved our lives.

1292
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,480
Why are you arresting us?
Arrest the collaborator!

1293
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,360
Didn't I tell you to
never cross me again?

1294
01:33:08,395 --> 01:33:09,998
Inspector, there's
been a mistake.

1295
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:11,765
- Muro...
- Çeto...

1296
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:13,000
Sweetie, there has been
a misunderstanding.

1297
01:33:13,035 --> 01:33:14,085
We'll fix it quickly.

1298
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,348
Once again, the collaborators..

1299
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,591
... the capitalists win!
Damn this world!

1300
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:29,154
Muro, don't you worry!

1301
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:31,550
I'll take care of the girls
while you're gone.

1302
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:51,319
Damn my love for humans...
