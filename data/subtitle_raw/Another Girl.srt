00:02:24,494 --> 00:02:25,395
What the fuck?

3
00:02:26,928 --> 00:02:27,829
Hello?

4
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:28,997
Hi, Patrick.

5
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:32,502
Come on, it's not that late.

6
00:02:32,635 --> 00:02:33,770
It is when
your kids are gonna

7
00:02:33,902 --> 00:02:35,505
be waking you up in a few hours.

8
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:38,574
Just do what Mom did,
tell 'em to get their asses

9
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,543
back in bed or else Santa
will give their presents

10
00:02:40,677 --> 00:02:42,445
to poor black kids.

11
00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:45,682
God,
she was a bitch.

12
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:47,015
Was?

13
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:49,786
Oh, right, now she's a cunt.

14
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:56,858
Um, hey, remember at
lunch the other day

15
00:02:56,992 --> 00:02:59,061
that book I was reading,
"Undiscovered Girl"?

16
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:01,164
The one about the
teenage blogger?

17
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:03,266
Are you smoking?

18
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:03,965
What?

19
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,867
No, I quit.

20
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:07,270
Stop.

21
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:09,272
Look, anyway, I just
finished reading the book

22
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:13,242
and at the end Katie,
that's the blogger's name,

23
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:17,280
Katie Kampenfelt,
she goes missing.

24
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:19,981
What, you mean...

25
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:22,185
She narrates the whole
book and then at the end

26
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:25,987
her mom takes over
and says that a ton

27
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:28,725
of what Katie told
us about herself,

28
00:03:28,857 --> 00:03:32,428
even her name, it isn't true.

29
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:39,569
And then after her last blog
entry she got into her car

30
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,205
and she was never seen again.

31
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:46,743
She's never used any
of her credit cards

32
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,178
and never used a cell phone.

33
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:52,482
The mom wants us to
try to help find her.

34
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:54,717
So, what are you...

35
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:58,254
I just, I need to know what
happened to her, you know?

36
00:03:58,388 --> 00:03:59,222
Like...

37
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:02,958
Was she kidnapped?

38
00:04:03,091 --> 00:04:04,527
Did she run away?

39
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,094
They discovered a dead
body at the end of the book

40
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:08,765
but we don't know if
it's Katie or not.

41
00:04:08,897 --> 00:04:11,467
You're talking
about her like she's real.

42
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:12,568
She could be.

43
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,873
Maybe it could be
based on a true story.

44
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:18,474
It's possible, right?

45
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:20,343
Where'd
you buy the book?

46
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:21,878
Amazon.

47
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,613
Fiction
or nonfiction?

48
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:27,250
Wait, didn't you
say a guy wrote it?

49
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,188
I'm sorry, I'm-

50
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:34,791
- Lonely, I know.

51
00:04:34,923 --> 00:04:36,091
Get some sleep.

52
00:04:37,092 --> 00:04:37,993
Come over whenever
you want tomorrow.

53
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:39,829
The earlier the better.

54
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:41,096
Oh, hey, tell Mom
to pick up a gallon

55
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,498
of apple cider on the way.

56
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:43,533
Okay.

57
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:45,802
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

58
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:54,804
Dear Katie,
I just finished your book

59
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,372
and now I can't sleep.

60
00:05:57,707 --> 00:06:01,344
I keep imagining your body
lying in the woods somewhere.

61
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:07,683
Empty eyes, wet, filthy hair.

62
00:06:09,652 --> 00:06:13,021
Bugs crawling inside
your nose and ears.

63
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:18,361
It's been awhile since
my mind turned this dark.

64
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:21,096
What can I say?

65
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm by myself too much.

66
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:28,404
I overthink everything.

67
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:33,376
Anyway, I'm not an idiot.

68
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,379
I know you're not really Katie.

69
00:06:38,748 --> 00:06:40,383
You're just an author.

70
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:44,720
Some dude trying to sell books.

71
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:53,696
But if you really were
Katie, we'd be best friends.

72
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:57,400
I know it.

73
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,432
Do you think he's
gonna write back?

74
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:30,433
Who?

75
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,401
The writer.

76
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:34,670
Oh.

77
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:37,640
He's probably too busy
jerking off in the mirror.

78
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:39,308
What do you mean?

79
00:07:39,442 --> 00:07:41,677
Well, yeah, he
wants to sell books,

80
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,346
but he also wants
fangirls to write him

81
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,715
and tell him what
a genius he is.

82
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:47,148
It's pathetic.

83
00:07:47,283 --> 00:07:48,451
Let it go.

84
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:50,786
Yeah.

85
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,657
Dear
Katie, I loved your book.

86
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,327
I'm 16 and I live
in a wheelchair.

87
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,595
What happened to you?

88
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,630
Are you dead?

89
00:08:00,763 --> 00:08:02,865
I won't tell anyone, I promise.

90
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:08,204
Dear
Katie, my father was a lawyer

91
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:10,339
and a drug addict
who beat the shit out

92
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:12,274
of me and my two brothers.

93
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:16,479
When I was in the third
grade he overdosed and died.

94
00:08:18,114 --> 00:08:21,384
It left a hole in my heart
so huge nothing can fill it.

95
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,720
If you were real, I
know you'd understand.

96
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:32,962
Dear Katie, one night
last summer my boyfriend

97
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,498
and I made love for
three hours straight.

98
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:39,568
Tonight memories of
him tear me apart.

99
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:43,773
If you're really
flesh and blood,

100
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:47,343
thank you so much
for listening to me.

101
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:26,282
Is this some sort of joke?

102
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:33,222
Your mom said that
you disappeared.

103
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:14,263
My mom
didn't write that, I did,

104
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:15,965
and I never disappeared.

105
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,537
I just wanted to
end my blog forever,

106
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,741
cancel my reality show, so
I pretended to be my mom.

107
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:29,212
But
if you're a real person

108
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:31,680
why is your book
sold as fiction?

109
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:34,116
And why is there a
man's name on the cover?

110
00:10:35,152 --> 00:10:36,585
Same reason I made up

111
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,888
the name Katie Kampenfelt;
to be anonymous.

112
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:42,124
I think private lives
should stay private.

113
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:43,793
I'm a big fan of boundaries.

114
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:46,428
Do you
write back to every reader

115
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,596
who contacts you?

116
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:50,399
Actually, you're the first.

117
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:55,004
It's obvious you're smart,
cool, and need a friend.

118
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:56,705
So do I.

119
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:00,009
And according to your Facebook
we live only 87 miles apart,

120
00:11:00,142 --> 00:11:01,010
which is wonderful.

121
00:11:02,978 --> 00:11:04,380
But
if you never write back

122
00:11:04,513 --> 00:11:06,315
why even bother having
a contact button?

123
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:11,987
Because I love being loved.

124
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:13,889
What's better than fan mail?

125
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:16,659
You wouldn't believe
how much I get.

126
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:38,848
Elle, my publisher
forwarded me your letter.

127
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:40,482
I'm sorry to have
to tell you this,

128
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,686
but I have nothing to do
with KatieKampenfelt.com.

129
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,589
I have no idea who
created this site

130
00:11:46,722 --> 00:11:48,624
or who's emailing you,
but it's not Katie,

131
00:11:48,757 --> 00:11:50,459
because she doesn't exist.

132
00:11:50,593 --> 00:11:52,461
She's just a
character I invented.

133
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:55,232
She is not and never was real.

134
00:11:55,364 --> 00:11:56,131
Be well.

135
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,435
So, what should I
do about fake Katie?

136
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:01,070
Nothing.

137
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:02,004
I'll do it.

138
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,242
Hey, creep.

139
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:08,245
The author says you're a liar.

140
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:10,746
Katie's make believe.

141
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,717
Write to me again, I'm
calling my uncle at the FBI.

142
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:18,787
You're welcome.

143
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:24,927
Okay,
butt head, here's the story.

144
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,163
I met the author
at a book signing,

145
00:12:27,297 --> 00:12:28,764
he clearly wanted to bone me,

146
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:31,901
so I sent him the link
to my blog archive.

147
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:34,304
He loved it, he thought
the way I ended it

148
00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:38,507
using my mom's voice to say
I disappeared was genius.

149
00:12:38,641 --> 00:12:40,509
He offered to help me
re-write it and get

150
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:42,245
it published as a novel.

151
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,513
I told him no way, but
if he wanted to do it

152
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:46,349
we could split the money.

153
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:49,518
Only he'd have to promise never
to tell anyone I was real.

154
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:51,787
And that's why he lied to you.

155
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:52,755
You see?

156
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:32,295
What?

157
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:33,696
You actually don't believe me?

158
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:35,664
You really think
I made it all up?

159
00:13:35,798 --> 00:13:37,833
Dude, why would I even do that?

160
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,471
Men do all kinds of
sick shit for no reason.

161
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:49,111
Either you're a
Christian or you're not.

162
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,281
Clearly she's not,
otherwise she wouldn't

163
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,614
have married a Jew.

164
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:55,617
At least not that one.

165
00:13:56,453 --> 00:13:58,487
Do you know he didn't
even give little Olivia

166
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,955
a choice about the bar mitzvah?

167
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,123
Can you imagine?

168
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,059
Bat, not bar.

169
00:14:04,194 --> 00:14:05,761
I don't care
if he did adopt her,

170
00:14:05,894 --> 00:14:07,730
it doesn't give him the
right to impose his faith

171
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:09,598
on a defenseless child.

172
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:10,766
It's...

173
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,702
Where do you think you're going?

174
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,573
Plate, sink.

175
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:19,269
My
best friend Natasha thinks

176
00:15:19,402 --> 00:15:21,770
you're dangerous,
but I'm not sure what

177
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:23,572
I'm supposed to be afraid of.

178
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:25,275
You can't get any
money out of me,

179
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:26,875
because I don't have any.

180
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:30,145
You can't hurt me worse
than I hurt myself.

181
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:41,957
The first time you wrote you
said that you were listening.

182
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:45,894
It's what I need more
than anything right now.

183
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:48,797
Can I tell you my story?

184
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:49,765
Please.

185
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:50,933
Are you judgmental?

186
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,269
Yeah, right.

187
00:15:53,403 --> 00:15:57,507
My story is about the
infinite stupidity of love.

188
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,941
You can relate, of course.

189
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:01,777
You swear you won't tell anyone?

190
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,979
On my vaginal health.

191
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,950
I'll write it
out in big chunks.

192
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:11,887
Where do I begin?

193
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:16,058
My mom made me audition
for the cheerleading squad

194
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:17,926
even though cheering
represents pretty much

195
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,995
everything I hate about America.

196
00:16:21,964 --> 00:16:24,700
L-E-T-S-G-O,
let's go, let's go.

197
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,836
L-E-T-S-G-O, let's go, let's go.

198
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,106
L-E-T-S-G-O, let's go, let's go.

199
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:32,074
Go, Bulls!

200
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,977
Thank you for your time.

201
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:44,187
Dude, I would cum
on her face with the force

202
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,289
of a thousand suns.

203
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,426
That little brown one
was pretty hot, too.

204
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,727
Yeah.

205
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:54,730
But what if you knocked her up?

206
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:57,666
Consider the genetic
consequences.

207
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:00,903
Ooh, you make an
excellent point, sir.

208
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,840
Wait, who was the one
from the Special Olympics?

209
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:10,446
- Elle something.
- Right.

210
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:15,884
Cute face, but, curses
on them tiny titties.

211
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,223
I
knew they were idiots.

212
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:20,956
Didn't matter.

213
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:48,451
Did you swallow these?

214
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:02,665
Thank God it's coming up.

215
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:05,702
You have been given
every advantage.

216
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,935
Why should I pay for college?

217
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:09,572
What you need is
missionary work.

218
00:18:09,706 --> 00:18:13,809
A few weeks at our camp in Ghana
would wake you up pretty fast.

219
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:15,978
They live on a dollar a day!

220
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:18,880
Come on.

221
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,384
Mommy.

222
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,219
That's enough for today.

223
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,122
Sweet
dreams, beautiful girl.

224
00:18:30,826 --> 00:18:32,495
Don't call me that.

225
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:33,895
Why not?

226
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,299
You seriously think I'm a dude?

227
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,434
Fap, fap, fap, fap.

228
00:18:38,568 --> 00:18:39,801
I'm sorry.

229
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:42,705
Don't be mad, it's
just so ridiculous.

230
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:44,139
Want me to send you a pic?

231
00:18:56,619 --> 00:18:58,920
You look just like
I thought you would.

232
00:19:01,424 --> 00:19:03,426
Dear
Katie, as soon as I started

233
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,195
to love you toward the end
I knew you'd be destroyed.

234
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:09,131
Pretty much everyone I've
ever loved has died on me.

235
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:11,567
Why is God so cruel?

236
00:19:14,036 --> 00:19:15,937
I hated college.

237
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,373
After freshman year
I begged my mom

238
00:19:17,507 --> 00:19:20,008
to let me transfer
to art school.

239
00:19:20,142 --> 00:19:21,678
Instead, she pulled
strings to get me into

240
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:26,148
a Christian sorority, also
known as hell on earth.

241
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:51,607
Excuse me.

242
00:19:51,741 --> 00:19:54,109
I seem to have lost my
virginity, can I have yours?

243
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:56,212
Offensive lineman?

244
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,980
Why do you say that?

245
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,185
Because that was
an offense line, man.

246
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,321
- Yo, my name's-
- Hold on, hold on,

247
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:06,289
let me guess.

248
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,293
Kyle.

249
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:12,961
Not even close.

250
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:14,764
Biff?

251
00:20:14,896 --> 00:20:15,864
Nope, it's-

252
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:17,032
- Okay, hold on.

253
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:19,134
Chip.

254
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:20,936
Chad.

255
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:24,640
Oh, I'm getting warmer.

256
00:20:24,774 --> 00:20:29,010
Um, oh, I know.

257
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,215
You're a Tad.

258
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:34,916
How did you do that?

259
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:38,421
It's magic and
you're a tad annoying.

260
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:40,390
- Not so fast.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

261
00:20:40,523 --> 00:20:42,057
Hey, too rough.

262
00:20:42,191 --> 00:20:43,459
They
say you know everything

263
00:20:43,593 --> 00:20:45,261
about a person the
minute you meet them.

264
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:47,397
I sure did.

265
00:20:49,232 --> 00:20:53,536
Look, you don't
know how to kiss.

266
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:03,111
There is one right way
and a million wrong ways.

267
00:21:04,247 --> 00:21:07,250
But don't worry,
'cause I can teach you.

268
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:11,287
And for years bitches
be like damn, boy,

269
00:21:11,421 --> 00:21:13,322
where you learn
to kiss like that?

270
00:21:14,657 --> 00:21:16,259
I have a better idea.

271
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:20,863
Shut the fuck up.

272
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:23,599
It
went on for months.

273
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:26,134
I saw the way
you looked at him.

274
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:30,273
He
always cried afterwards.

275
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:35,378
Apologized, said it
would never happen again.

276
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:50,560
Pretty nasty.

277
00:21:50,693 --> 00:21:51,727
Yeah, he is.

278
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:57,266
Your boyfriend did this?

279
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,302
Indirectly.

280
00:22:00,203 --> 00:22:01,304
And this?

281
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:03,306
This?

282
00:22:07,008 --> 00:22:08,043
Directly.

283
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:13,316
Isn't it time to move on?

284
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:17,653
I guess
it just depends.

285
00:22:19,988 --> 00:22:21,390
On what?

286
00:22:21,524 --> 00:22:23,559
On whether or not
I deserve better.

287
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:28,731
What will it
take to convince you?

288
00:22:31,968 --> 00:22:34,670
Um, I don't know, maybe death?

289
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:40,343
I'm sorry.

290
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:44,347
I'm sorry.

291
00:22:48,985 --> 00:22:50,219
Will he let you go?

292
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:55,525
Not without a fight.

293
00:22:56,926 --> 00:22:58,361
Let's avoid that, okay?

294
00:23:01,864 --> 00:23:02,698
How?

295
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:05,568
We live together.

296
00:23:06,769 --> 00:23:08,738
Do you have someone
who can help you move out?

297
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:11,440
Maybe someone from
your sorority.

298
00:23:11,574 --> 00:23:12,408
No.

299
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:19,181
Parent?

300
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,422
Mom, I...

301
00:23:28,224 --> 00:23:29,825
Yeah.

302
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,126
Look, see I...

303
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,398
I'm thinking about
hurting myself again.

304
00:23:37,934 --> 00:23:38,768
I dream...

305
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,408
Can I please just come home?

306
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:48,377
Um, Patrick?

307
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:52,248
If I did quit school, could I...

308
00:23:53,416 --> 00:23:55,418
Could I maybe stay
with you and Marcy?

309
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:58,354
You know, just like until
I get like an apartment

310
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:00,756
or, you know, like a job.

311
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:03,492
I mean, I could babysit for you.

312
00:24:08,564 --> 00:24:12,468
I was thinking that maybe
I could move out there

313
00:24:12,602 --> 00:24:15,136
and like stay with
you for a bit.

314
00:24:16,104 --> 00:24:18,441
I won't be in your
way at all, I...

315
00:24:19,442 --> 00:24:21,577
And once I get a job I can...

316
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:24,373
I hardly
knew my oldest brother Connor.

317
00:25:24,507 --> 00:25:27,043
He left for college right
after my father died.

318
00:25:27,176 --> 00:25:30,713
Then he went to law school and
only came home for Christmas.

319
00:25:30,846 --> 00:25:34,517
By the time I was in high school
he never came home at all.

320
00:25:35,418 --> 00:25:36,585
I never knew why.

321
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:43,192
Oh, Ellie belly.

322
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:45,194
You need so much love.

323
00:25:45,995 --> 00:25:46,829
I do.

324
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,705
Hey, meet the
in-house expert, huh?

325
00:25:59,075 --> 00:26:01,977
This is my fiance, Joseph.

326
00:26:03,746 --> 00:26:04,547
Delighted.

327
00:26:11,587 --> 00:26:13,556
You really had no clue?

328
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,561
Hello?

329
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:23,699
Are you there?

330
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,402
Paging Elle Overton.

331
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,578
Please don't disappear again.

332
00:26:36,946 --> 00:26:37,780
I'm begging you.

333
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:52,361
♪ Struggling to feel something ♪

334
00:26:52,495 --> 00:26:57,600
♪ Other than this pain ♪

335
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,371

336
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:04,306
Sweetheart,
you're roasting.

337
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,608
You want a hat?

338
00:27:07,276 --> 00:27:08,310
You need a hat.

339
00:27:15,017 --> 00:27:16,552
Multiple choice:

340
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:18,487
you're ghosting me because, A,

341
00:27:18,621 --> 00:27:20,990
telling your life
story is painful.

342
00:27:21,123 --> 00:27:25,195
B, Natasha found out we're
pen pals and kicked your ass.

343
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:28,265
Or C, you killed yourself.

344
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,698
C is closest.

345
00:27:31,834 --> 00:27:32,868
Writing to me doesn't

346
00:27:33,002 --> 00:27:34,303
make you feel better?

347
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:35,971
Does a little.

348
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,140
Temporarily.

349
00:27:50,986 --> 00:27:51,954
Here's the next chapter.

350
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:52,922
Enjoy!

351
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:54,690
Come, come on!

352
00:27:58,661 --> 00:27:59,762
When
my mom found out Connor

353
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:01,630
took me in, she
called him Judas.

354
00:28:02,865 --> 00:28:06,468
If she'd known he was gay,
she would've hired a hitman.

355
00:28:07,336 --> 00:28:08,604
I don't get Joan Crawford.

356
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:11,507
Her shoulder pads were
like condor wings.

357
00:28:40,903 --> 00:28:42,137
Hi.

358
00:28:42,272 --> 00:28:44,540
Molly Andrews, such a
pleasure to meet you, Elle.

359
00:28:44,673 --> 00:28:45,941
Thank you, same here.

360
00:28:46,075 --> 00:28:47,910
Did Sage offer you
something to drink?

361
00:28:48,043 --> 00:28:51,146
Diet soda, coffee,
coconut water?

362
00:28:51,281 --> 00:28:53,183
I'm fine, thanks.

363
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:54,149
Come in.

364
00:29:00,556 --> 00:29:02,725
Welcome to En Garde Creative.

365
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,661
Thanks, I'm so
grateful to be here.

366
00:29:05,794 --> 00:29:06,896
- Even just-
- Your brother thinks

367
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:08,831
the world of you
and my boss thinks

368
00:29:08,964 --> 00:29:10,233
the world of your brother, so-

369
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:12,568
- Here we are.
- Yeah.

370
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:14,403
How much do you know about us?

371
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:18,540
Well, just what's
on the website,

372
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:20,876
but I wanna know everything.

373
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:24,480
Well, we're
small, but growing.

374
00:29:24,613 --> 00:29:26,015
Our work is exclusively digital,

375
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:27,883
marketing directly
via email, text,

376
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:30,519
social media, and
search engines.

377
00:29:30,653 --> 00:29:33,356
Right now all of our
clients are domestic,

378
00:29:33,489 --> 00:29:34,857
located west of the Mississippi,

379
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,892
but we are starting to
attract some interest

380
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:40,163
in the Pacific rim as
well, so who knows.

381
00:29:41,497 --> 00:29:43,832
Wow, really exciting.

382
00:29:43,966 --> 00:29:44,800
It is.

383
00:29:45,668 --> 00:29:46,769
Now tell me about you.

384
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:51,941
Well, um, I was blown
away when Connor told

385
00:29:52,074 --> 00:29:55,345
me about the job because
in college I majored

386
00:29:55,477 --> 00:29:59,182
in marketing with a special
focus on interactive media.

387
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:03,153
I actually left because
I just felt like...

388
00:30:03,286 --> 00:30:06,455
I felt trapped in the
classroom setting, you know,

389
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:08,457
it just felt theoretical.

390
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,660
Like it was sort of just
like I really wanted

391
00:30:11,794 --> 00:30:13,996
some real world experien...

392
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,204
Oh, I got bit by a dog.

393
00:30:21,338 --> 00:30:22,172
What kind?

394
00:30:23,706 --> 00:30:24,807
A beagle.

395
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,510
I had one as a kid.

396
00:30:28,644 --> 00:30:30,112
It got run over
right in front of me,

397
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:32,014
I still haven't recovered.

398
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,116
Oh.

399
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,050
Dave Hastings.

400
00:30:37,786 --> 00:30:39,688
Welcome aboard, Connor's sister.

401
00:30:39,822 --> 00:30:42,425
Wait, you mean, I-

402
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:43,559
- That's right.

403
00:30:48,664 --> 00:30:50,132
We're over here.

404
00:30:50,699 --> 00:30:51,734
Go ahead, hop on.

405
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:55,571
Okay.

406
00:30:56,705 --> 00:30:58,107
You might want to check
underneath first, though.

407
00:30:58,241 --> 00:31:00,509
Your predecessor stuck
her chewed gum down there.

408
00:31:00,642 --> 00:31:02,077
That's why I fired her.

409
00:31:02,212 --> 00:31:03,679
Wait, really?

410
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:05,514
No, I dreamed her paltry.

411
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:07,649
Oh.

412
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,219
So, let's talk business.

413
00:31:10,853 --> 00:31:12,255
What did Connor say about me?

414
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:15,824
That you are charismatic,
brilliant and funny.

415
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,726
He didn't mention humble?

416
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,162
- No.
- That's weird.

417
00:31:24,267 --> 00:31:27,102
So, tell me more
about the gum chewer.

418
00:31:27,237 --> 00:31:29,805
Because you don't wanna
make the same mistakes?

419
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:31,940
Yeah, I wanna make new ones.

420
00:31:32,074 --> 00:31:33,742
She was just too passive.

421
00:31:33,876 --> 00:31:36,312
If there's a way for the
office to run more efficiently,

422
00:31:36,446 --> 00:31:37,579
I wanna know about it.

423
00:31:37,713 --> 00:31:38,881
If there's something
in my blind spot

424
00:31:39,014 --> 00:31:40,316
I need you to
scream, "Watch out".

425
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,651
Maybe you have a concept
for one of our campaigns,

426
00:31:42,785 --> 00:31:44,653
it doesn't matter if it's
above your pay grade,

427
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:45,788
I wanna hear it.

428
00:32:43,846 --> 00:32:44,980
It'll be so much
fun finding them.

429
00:32:46,682 --> 00:32:47,950
Hey, look who's here.

430
00:32:50,986 --> 00:32:51,820
My new assistant, Elle Overton.

431
00:32:51,954 --> 00:32:53,223
My wife Carmen.

432
00:32:53,356 --> 00:32:55,624
Hi, I've
heard so much about you.

433
00:32:55,757 --> 00:32:56,992
Same here.

434
00:32:57,126 --> 00:32:57,960
So, Elle just had
a great idea about

435
00:32:58,093 --> 00:32:59,094
the Eye Candy account.

436
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:00,929
You know those eye test charts?

437
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:02,599
She thought it would be fun
to post a chart each week,

438
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,168
but hidden inside the jumble
of letters is a promo code.

439
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:06,635
Baby, will you
tell me in the car?

440
00:33:06,768 --> 00:33:08,304
We're gonna be late.

441
00:33:08,438 --> 00:33:09,972
Shit, I lost track.

442
00:33:11,508 --> 00:33:12,509
Can you close up?

443
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:13,675
Yeah.

444
00:33:14,477 --> 00:33:15,311
Oh.

445
00:33:17,514 --> 00:33:19,715
Hey, you wanna make extra money?

446
00:33:19,848 --> 00:33:20,816
Uh, who doesn't?

447
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:22,684
We need a babysitter.

448
00:33:22,818 --> 00:33:23,852
Oh.

449
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:26,322
You have kids, wow.

450
00:33:26,456 --> 00:33:27,756
Yeah, I would love to.

451
00:33:29,225 --> 00:33:31,594
I have a lot of experience.

452
00:33:31,727 --> 00:33:32,761
Perfect.

453
00:33:41,571 --> 00:33:43,138
I know
what you're thinking,

454
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:45,974
it was just like when you
were hired to be a nanny.

455
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:48,010
But there was a huge difference.

456
00:33:48,844 --> 00:33:51,214
You were way hotter
than the mom.

457
00:33:52,981 --> 00:33:54,950
I was a boy compared to Carmen.

458
00:34:02,592 --> 00:34:03,859
Perfect timing.

459
00:34:03,992 --> 00:34:05,994
Three minutes after
brewing the antioxidants

460
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,664
start to evaporate.

461
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:10,500
Is that Facebook
or actual science?

462
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:12,268
It's actual Twitter.

463
00:34:16,506 --> 00:34:17,674
Rough night?

464
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:18,740
Yeah, the roughest.

465
00:34:18,874 --> 00:34:20,042
What happened?

466
00:34:21,678 --> 00:34:24,681
Went to a cocktail party
sponsored by a tequila company.

467
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,483
I behaved, Carmen didn't.

468
00:34:27,617 --> 00:34:28,817
She, uh...

469
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:30,653
Oh, she'd kill me.

470
00:34:30,786 --> 00:34:32,589
Well, I won't tell anyone.

471
00:34:32,721 --> 00:34:33,755
I promise.

472
00:34:39,094 --> 00:34:40,996
When I met Carmen she
was just a few years

473
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:44,733
out of college, I mean, still
pretty much a party girl.

474
00:34:44,866 --> 00:34:46,402
She said she was sick of it,

475
00:34:46,536 --> 00:34:50,373
she wanted a husband, four kids,
and start her own business.

476
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:52,375
I mean, that
sounded great to me.

477
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:55,010
So we got married,
Esme was born,

478
00:34:55,978 --> 00:34:57,879
and out of nowhere she announces

479
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,915
she doesn't want anymore kids.

480
00:35:00,749 --> 00:35:02,084
Well, that was a surprise.

481
00:35:04,621 --> 00:35:08,157
When I started En Garde I
assumed she'd get involved,

482
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:13,496
help us out, but she
doesn't give a shit.

483
00:35:14,464 --> 00:35:15,864
I mean, she wants it
to succeed, of course,

484
00:35:15,998 --> 00:35:17,166
for financial reasons,
but that's it.

485
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,900
So if she doesn't
want anymore kids

486
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:20,503
and she doesn't care
about the business,

487
00:35:20,637 --> 00:35:22,472
then what makes her happy?

488
00:35:22,605 --> 00:35:23,439
Shopping.

489
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,907
Oh.

490
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,243
A few nights a week she
still goes out partying

491
00:35:27,377 --> 00:35:28,844
with her old college friends.

492
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:30,879
So she's not over it.

493
00:35:31,013 --> 00:35:32,080
Looks that way.

494
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:34,916
Anyway, last night she, uh...

495
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,420
Man, this
is so inappropriate.

496
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:38,454
Oh, my favorite.

497
00:35:40,623 --> 00:35:41,923
She puked up on me.

498
00:35:43,025 --> 00:35:44,126
Wait, literally?

499
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,462
No, trust me, it
was no metaphor.

500
00:35:46,596 --> 00:35:47,829
How does that even happen?

501
00:35:47,963 --> 00:35:49,632
I don't know, I
was fast asleep.

502
00:35:49,766 --> 00:35:52,868
I assumed she'd just staggered
in from the loo and blah.

503
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:53,969
Oh, my God.

504
00:35:54,102 --> 00:35:55,538
I woke up drenched in puke,

505
00:35:55,672 --> 00:35:56,938
she was passed out on the floor.

506
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,775
I had to take her to
the guest bedroom.

507
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,042
By the time I
finished cleaning up

508
00:36:00,176 --> 00:36:02,811
Esme was awake demanding
breakfast, so...

509
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:05,648
Yeah.

510
00:36:05,782 --> 00:36:07,883
Oh, you poor thing.

511
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:15,525
You know, it's nice
to have someone pity me.

512
00:36:18,328 --> 00:36:20,563
Other than myself, of course.

513
00:36:27,503 --> 00:36:29,272
Your emails
are like my favorite novel.

514
00:36:34,177 --> 00:36:36,479
Oh no, you're depressed again.

515
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:45,887
Are you bleeding, too?

516
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:47,190
I am.

517
00:36:48,491 --> 00:36:50,025
I wonder if our
cycles are in sync.

518
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:52,495
You know, like roomies.

519
00:36:54,263 --> 00:36:55,665
I
loved your book until

520
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:58,368
I found out it was written
by a middle-aged man.

521
00:36:58,501 --> 00:37:00,670
For to your appropriate
the heart, soul,

522
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:04,607
and body of a young girl
is absolutely disgusting.

523
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:11,214
What do
you eat when you're bleeding?

524
00:37:12,448 --> 00:37:15,218
I just ate an entire
bag of kettle corn.

525
00:37:21,557 --> 00:37:23,959
Telling your story
will save your life.

526
00:37:24,092 --> 00:37:25,161
I promise.

527
00:37:25,294 --> 00:37:27,230
It definitely saved mine.

528
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:31,734
I know how to wake you up.

529
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:35,036
I'll tell you something
about myself you don't know.

530
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:36,205
Let me see.

531
00:37:39,074 --> 00:37:41,544
Okay, how's this?

532
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:42,612
I'm married.

533
00:37:48,116 --> 00:37:49,151
Seriously?

534
00:37:50,453 --> 00:37:52,255
We have a baby.

535
00:38:00,229 --> 00:38:01,898
I thought you got an abortion.

536
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:05,601
I did, my
daughter was conceived later.

537
00:38:07,102 --> 00:38:08,136
The right way.

538
00:38:09,104 --> 00:38:11,207
With someone who loves
me unconditionally.

539
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,282
I want that so badly.

540
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:22,752
You'll have it,

541
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:25,588
and you'll love your baby
as much as I love Sarah.

542
00:38:29,692 --> 00:38:30,526
Sarah.

543
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:34,129
That's my middle name.

544
00:38:36,299 --> 00:38:37,400
Cool.

545
00:38:39,268 --> 00:38:41,304
Now, please get
back to your story.

546
00:38:44,373 --> 00:38:46,141
Why do you even care?

547
00:38:47,276 --> 00:38:49,278
We're friends.

548
00:38:51,647 --> 00:38:52,582
Strangers.

549
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,318
We're both.

550
00:38:58,821 --> 00:39:00,389
It shouldn't even be possible.

551
00:39:04,059 --> 00:39:05,761
Good job.

552
00:39:08,464 --> 00:39:10,333
This one or this one?

553
00:39:12,033 --> 00:39:15,771
Um, it's so hard to choose.

554
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,041
Which one goes better
with vampire red?

555
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:24,580
The black one.

556
00:39:24,714 --> 00:39:25,815
You're right.

557
00:39:28,149 --> 00:39:30,051
Miss Elle, you
have pretty lips.

558
00:39:30,186 --> 00:39:31,454
Thank you.

559
00:39:31,587 --> 00:39:32,421
You, too.

560
00:39:35,191 --> 00:39:37,827
So Dave says you wanna
start your own business.

561
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,362
Definitely.

562
00:39:39,495 --> 00:39:42,198
Well we could use some
help over at the office.

563
00:39:43,165 --> 00:39:45,167
How come you don't
drop by more often?

564
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:46,869
You'll understand
when you have kids.

565
00:39:47,003 --> 00:39:49,438
This little bug kicks my butt
all day, don't you, bonita?

566
00:39:49,572 --> 00:39:51,207
Except when I'm at Rainbow.

567
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,107
What's that?

568
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:53,676
Her preschool.

569
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:56,879
After Rainbow Rosalinda
comes over, she's my nanny.

570
00:39:57,013 --> 00:40:00,516
But there are some things
only a mommy can do, right baby?

571
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,084
Rosalinda plays hide
and seek and monsters

572
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:04,720
and we build pillow forts.

573
00:40:04,854 --> 00:40:07,356
Mommy takes you to movies
and yummy restaurants

574
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,425
and buys you pretty dresses.

575
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:12,093
Mommy, can Miss Elle
take a bath with me?

576
00:40:15,431 --> 00:40:17,266
No, I know.

577
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,702
I'm not sure, as quick
as I can darling, okay?

578
00:40:21,136 --> 00:40:22,070
Bye.

579
00:40:26,242 --> 00:40:27,910
This is my favorite.

580
00:40:30,379 --> 00:40:31,914
What do you think of him?

581
00:40:32,048 --> 00:40:33,616
Brilliant.

582
00:40:35,551 --> 00:40:37,920
If you're ever looking
for a present for Carmen.

583
00:40:38,054 --> 00:40:39,120
The bikini or the girl?

584
00:40:39,255 --> 00:40:40,957
The bikini.

585
00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:42,325
It's right up her alley.

586
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:44,125
It is exactly
why'd she wear it.

587
00:40:45,227 --> 00:40:46,796
I would too if I had her body.

588
00:40:52,301 --> 00:40:57,073
Her closet is like
backstage at Fashion Week,

589
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:58,441
I mean, it's insane.

590
00:40:59,308 --> 00:41:00,476
How do you afford it?

591
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,911
I don't.

592
00:41:02,044 --> 00:41:03,346
I can't.

593
00:41:03,479 --> 00:41:05,715
She blows through my
trust like play money.

594
00:41:05,848 --> 00:41:08,517
Each month we barely make
it to the finish line.

595
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:18,527
I am gonna email
the photographer

596
00:41:18,661 --> 00:41:21,998
and see if he is available.

597
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:33,643
Can I ask you a
personal question?

598
00:41:35,311 --> 00:41:36,479
Why'd I marry her?

599
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:44,553
Honestly, we had fun at first.

600
00:41:45,888 --> 00:41:48,290
Went to the gym
together, we went hiking.

601
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:51,627
We traveled loads.

602
00:41:51,761 --> 00:41:54,830
Nonstop shagging, our
chemistry was incredible.

603
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,535
Once Esme was born
all the fun stopped.

604
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:04,907
No more sex?

605
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:07,810
On the once-a-month plan now.

606
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:11,814
Such a cliche.

607
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:14,383
Even a blind man
could've seen it coming.

608
00:42:16,686 --> 00:42:20,423
Marry for conversation, it's
the only thing that lasts.

609
00:42:30,366 --> 00:42:31,600
So, Mom called.

610
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,538
Welcome back.

611
00:42:37,506 --> 00:42:38,808
What'd she say?

612
00:42:38,941 --> 00:42:43,979
I'm still disowned,
still Judas, but not you.

613
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:46,916
She said that even
though she'd preferred

614
00:42:47,049 --> 00:42:48,918
if you went back and
finished at State,

615
00:42:49,051 --> 00:42:52,922
she is fine with you going
to any school you want.

616
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,390
Even art school.

617
00:42:54,523 --> 00:42:56,726
She'll pay for it, too,
no questions asked.

618
00:42:57,393 --> 00:42:58,861
Wait, really?

619
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,197
Yeah, yeah.

620
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:01,864
I'm pretty sure
it's the first time

621
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:03,532
she's surrendered to
anyone since she spread

622
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:05,568
her legs for our
lord and savior.

623
00:43:08,304 --> 00:43:09,271
What's the matter? You won.

624
00:43:09,405 --> 00:43:10,706
You're supposed to be happier.

625
00:43:14,343 --> 00:43:15,945
Oh, shit, you don't wanna leave.

626
00:43:18,781 --> 00:43:19,615
What's his name?

627
00:43:23,486 --> 00:43:24,754
You don't know him.

628
00:43:25,921 --> 00:43:28,591
Besides, it doesn't matter,
he's got a girlfriend.

629
00:43:31,627 --> 00:43:32,595
Is he into you?

630
00:43:35,331 --> 00:43:36,365
No.

631
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:40,569
I don't know, maybe.

632
00:43:40,703 --> 00:43:41,604
Maybe.

633
00:43:47,476 --> 00:43:51,013
Listen,
any guy that you like

634
00:43:51,147 --> 00:43:54,283
who's unavailable, isn't a guy.

635
00:43:55,252 --> 00:43:56,085
He's a drug.

636
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:59,189
And not like a
drug, an actual one.

637
00:44:00,422 --> 00:44:02,758
And way back in the 80s, what
did the scary skeletor lady

638
00:44:02,892 --> 00:44:05,728
in the White House tell us to
do when we get offered drugs?

639
00:44:06,495 --> 00:44:08,364
I don't know.

640
00:44:08,497 --> 00:44:09,832
Just say no.

641
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,601
Did anyone listen to her?

642
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,239
Of course not.

643
00:44:18,007 --> 00:44:19,341
I should've
phoned home the next day.

644
00:44:19,475 --> 00:44:21,544
It was the perfect
time to leave.

645
00:44:24,613 --> 00:44:25,681
But you thought Dave

646
00:44:25,815 --> 00:44:29,351
was your destiny, didn't you?

647
00:44:40,896 --> 00:44:43,432
Molly.

648
00:44:43,566 --> 00:44:44,800
Hey, you made it back.

649
00:44:45,534 --> 00:44:47,002
I wouldn't miss this.

650
00:44:47,136 --> 00:44:48,271
Happy birthday.

651
00:44:48,404 --> 00:44:49,605
Thank you.

652
00:44:51,941 --> 00:44:52,775
Hey.

653
00:44:54,543 --> 00:44:55,678
Where's Carmen?

654
00:44:55,811 --> 00:44:57,046
Already passed out.

655
00:44:58,248 --> 00:44:59,448
You slip her a roofie?

656
00:44:59,582 --> 00:45:01,218
Yeah, but I didn't
take advantage.

657
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:03,452
I heard there was cake.

658
00:45:03,586 --> 00:45:05,487
Yeah, she saved you some.

659
00:45:05,621 --> 00:45:06,789
Yeah? Where?

660
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:09,058
In the kitchen.

661
00:45:12,195 --> 00:45:13,529
What?

662
00:45:13,662 --> 00:45:15,165
I'm just happy
to see you, is all.

663
00:45:15,298 --> 00:45:16,799
You drunk?

664
00:45:16,932 --> 00:45:18,067
Yeah.

665
00:45:18,201 --> 00:45:19,001
Are you?

666
00:45:20,836 --> 00:45:21,670
Stoned?

667
00:45:33,183 --> 00:45:34,016
Come on.

668
00:46:36,979 --> 00:46:40,783
Dave and I continued on
like everything was normal.

669
00:46:42,352 --> 00:46:44,954
But then a week later we
were at the office late

670
00:46:47,556 --> 00:46:48,924
and he kissed me again.

671
00:46:51,794 --> 00:46:57,633
This time he was sober
and I didn't run away.

672
00:47:00,203 --> 00:47:01,737
If I had been a cartoon,

673
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:04,039
my tongue would've
popped out of his ear.

674
00:47:08,744 --> 00:47:12,748
Then, finally, he
pushed me away.

675
00:47:15,285 --> 00:47:19,621
He said, "I'm so sorry,
but I can't do this."

676
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:22,624
He was a married man.

677
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,627
I laughed.

678
00:47:26,162 --> 00:47:28,564
Like, what, like I
didn't know that?

679
00:47:28,697 --> 00:47:30,499
But I thought he was joking.

680
00:47:31,834 --> 00:47:36,705
And he said it like I was
the one who kissed him.

681
00:47:38,341 --> 00:47:39,275
It was nuts.

682
00:47:41,844 --> 00:47:43,112
But I didn't freak out.

683
00:47:44,314 --> 00:47:49,185
Just shrugged it off and said,
"You're right, whatever".

684
00:47:52,721 --> 00:47:55,024
Well, I must've been
a pretty good actress

685
00:47:56,226 --> 00:47:59,962
because he actually looked
hurt that I wasn't that upset.

686
00:48:03,632 --> 00:48:05,667
But then he started
kissing me again,

687
00:48:06,735 --> 00:48:08,871
but this time it
was more intense.

688
00:48:11,174 --> 00:48:15,677
He started grabbing my ass,
my boobs outside of my shirt.

689
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:23,085
And then he got on his
knees, lifted my skirt up,

690
00:48:24,086 --> 00:48:28,291
pulled my underwear down
and started licking me.

691
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,095
It was so fucking dirty.

692
00:48:35,597 --> 00:48:38,634
It's the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me.

693
00:48:42,439 --> 00:48:44,340
My eyes were open the whole time

694
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:49,279
and I just kept imagining
somebody walking in on us.

695
00:48:52,182 --> 00:48:53,715
I came so hard.

696
00:48:57,886 --> 00:49:00,622
Then about 10 seconds
later he said,

697
00:49:05,761 --> 00:49:09,898
"Shit, I'm late to meet Carmen".

698
00:49:11,468 --> 00:49:14,937
He got up, door slammed,

699
00:49:17,806 --> 00:49:18,941
and he's gone.

700
00:49:22,479 --> 00:49:23,313
And I...

701
00:49:31,887 --> 00:49:34,123
What
he did to you was rape.

702
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:37,659
Not literally, because
you enjoyed it,

703
00:49:38,827 --> 00:49:41,197
but emotional and
psychological violence.

704
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,902
How did
you get to be so strong?

705
00:49:47,903 --> 00:49:49,805
I'm
not a teenager anymore.

706
00:49:49,938 --> 00:49:52,342
I understand the
evil of human beings,

707
00:49:52,475 --> 00:49:54,977
especially those
cursed with nut sacks.

708
00:49:56,179 --> 00:49:58,181
On
Sunday nights, if I watch

709
00:49:58,314 --> 00:50:00,749
a corny Christian
movie with my mom

710
00:50:00,883 --> 00:50:02,185
she lets me borrow her car.

711
00:50:11,827 --> 00:50:13,729
My
husband's name is Kevin.

712
00:50:13,862 --> 00:50:15,998
He's tall, dark and handsome.

713
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:20,802
He used to be a Marine, now
he sells medical equipment.

714
00:50:23,206 --> 00:50:25,807
I stay home all day
with Sarah, she's three,

715
00:50:25,941 --> 00:50:29,011
beyond precious, the
best thing I ever did.

716
00:50:31,046 --> 00:50:32,515
How come you say
you wanna meet me

717
00:50:32,649 --> 00:50:35,351
but you never suggest that
we like talk on the phone?

718
00:50:35,485 --> 00:50:37,920
You never even ask
if we can text.

719
00:50:40,689 --> 00:50:42,325
That's just weird.

720
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:45,027
Kevin's a jealous freak.

721
00:50:45,161 --> 00:50:46,529
If we called or
texted each other,

722
00:50:46,663 --> 00:50:49,465
sooner or later he'd snoop
in my phone and bust me.

723
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:51,568
That's why I only get
fan mail on my laptop

724
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,870
and I delete everything
the second after I read it.

725
00:50:55,003 --> 00:50:57,105
Bust you for what?

726
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,274
Having a friend?

727
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:00,976
Is that an actual crime?

728
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:02,811
No, but we have a deal.

729
00:51:02,945 --> 00:51:04,480
No secrets.

730
00:51:04,614 --> 00:51:07,584
If I told him about you I'd
have to tell him how we met.

731
00:51:08,784 --> 00:51:13,323
He knows nothing about my blog,
my book, what a slut I was.

732
00:51:15,057 --> 00:51:16,959
If he knew he would go insane.

733
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:21,598
Fine, I get it.

734
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,131
We'll keep things
the way they are.

735
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,201
Where was I?

736
00:51:25,968 --> 00:51:28,904
Right, you won't believe this.

737
00:51:29,037 --> 00:51:31,873
But after he went down on
me, he put me right back

738
00:51:32,007 --> 00:51:34,477
in the friend zone
like it never happened.

739
00:51:35,678 --> 00:51:39,449
Being insane, I decided it
was because it grossed him out.

740
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:43,319
Like there was
something wrong with me.

741
00:51:46,155 --> 00:51:49,057
Katie,
I just finished reading.

742
00:51:49,192 --> 00:51:52,928
You've probably been chopped
into itty bitty pieces by now,

743
00:51:53,061 --> 00:51:55,565
but it's just as possible
a miracle occurred.

744
00:51:55,698 --> 00:51:59,669
I'm an aquarius, we're
all about miracles.

745
00:51:59,801 --> 00:52:01,837
So I choose to believe
you're out there

746
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:03,905
having an awesome life.

747
00:52:12,515 --> 00:52:13,316
Hello?

748
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:19,322
It's just me.

749
00:52:19,455 --> 00:52:21,123
I thought you weren't
gonna be back until tomorrow.

750
00:52:22,057 --> 00:52:23,859
I managed to escape early.

751
00:52:23,992 --> 00:52:24,960
What are you still doing here?

752
00:52:25,093 --> 00:52:26,162
Don't you have your own desk?

753
00:52:27,397 --> 00:52:30,700
I'm just seeing beyond
my job description.

754
00:52:30,832 --> 00:52:32,502
Working on some ideas.

755
00:52:32,635 --> 00:52:33,569
You have pluck.

756
00:52:34,537 --> 00:52:36,272
Well, you noticed.

757
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:43,780
What a waste of
time, the whole trip.

758
00:52:43,912 --> 00:52:45,947
Who ever the
Japanese were polite?

759
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:48,551
Someone who's never
heard of Pearl Harbor.

760
00:52:48,685 --> 00:52:50,152
Well, at least that
was over pretty quick.

761
00:52:50,286 --> 00:52:52,020
This was more like
the Bataan Death March

762
00:52:52,155 --> 00:52:54,524
with an order of cold uni.

763
00:52:56,793 --> 00:52:57,593
You want a drink?

764
00:52:58,894 --> 00:53:01,197
If it'll wash the taste
of uni out of my mind, yeah.

765
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:05,268
Fun fact, uni isn't
the actual urchin.

766
00:53:06,235 --> 00:53:08,438
It's the urchin's gonads.

767
00:53:08,571 --> 00:53:09,838
Make that a double.

768
00:53:19,114 --> 00:53:20,148
Thank you.

769
00:53:27,457 --> 00:53:29,192
So, how've you been?

770
00:53:32,662 --> 00:53:33,496
Honestly?

771
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:42,904
Come here.

772
00:53:56,952 --> 00:53:58,221
Tell me everything.

773
00:54:09,232 --> 00:54:11,133
What did you...

774
00:54:11,267 --> 00:54:13,569
It's manicure scissors.

775
00:54:17,306 --> 00:54:18,207
Is that my fault?

776
00:54:18,341 --> 00:54:19,074
No.

777
00:54:19,208 --> 00:54:19,876
No, no, no, no, no.

778
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:21,042
I um...

779
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:24,946
Been doing it for
years on and off.

780
00:54:26,616 --> 00:54:30,118
It's just whenever I get
overwhelmed by a situation

781
00:54:31,854 --> 00:54:35,191
or I feel like-

782
00:54:35,324 --> 00:54:38,026
- You wouldn't feel
overwhelmed if I had

783
00:54:38,161 --> 00:54:40,329
the courage to admit that
I was in love with you.

784
00:55:58,274 --> 00:56:00,209
Okay,
three crucial questions

785
00:56:00,343 --> 00:56:02,178
after a night of boneage.

786
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,147
How big was his dick?

787
00:56:06,282 --> 00:56:07,750
Did you go down on him?

788
00:56:08,618 --> 00:56:09,485
Did you cum?

789
00:56:14,022 --> 00:56:16,359
Waiting for my answers.

790
00:56:18,227 --> 00:56:20,363
I'm watching "True Crime" on TV.

791
00:56:20,496 --> 00:56:22,164
Did you know the leading
cause of homicide

792
00:56:22,298 --> 00:56:25,268
in women is having a smile
that lights up the room?

793
00:56:25,401 --> 00:56:28,103
In men it's giving friends
the shirt off your back.

794
00:56:29,772 --> 00:56:30,706
It's true!

795
00:56:31,874 --> 00:56:34,677
Last week a girl disappeared
a few miles from here.

796
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:37,914
Stella something-Polish.

797
00:56:38,046 --> 00:56:39,448
Did you read about it?

798
00:56:39,582 --> 00:56:43,586
They found her body this
morning floating in a reservoir.

799
00:56:45,053 --> 00:56:46,087
Yuck.

800
00:56:47,055 --> 00:56:48,089
Hello?

801
00:56:48,758 --> 00:56:49,692
Where are you?

802
00:56:50,826 --> 00:56:51,661
Are you dead?

803
00:56:58,467 --> 00:57:01,404
Sorry about last night,
I had a sugar crash.

804
00:57:02,638 --> 00:57:04,440
How do you stay up
so late and raise

805
00:57:04,574 --> 00:57:06,141
a kid at the same time?

806
00:57:06,275 --> 00:57:07,877
I have a
nanny five mornings a week.

807
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:10,046
I'm as lazy as Carmen.

808
00:57:10,179 --> 00:57:11,847
Hey, maybe I am Carmen.

809
00:57:12,715 --> 00:57:14,183
Ew, creepy.

810
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:16,185
Not funny if true.

811
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:18,254
Dude, it was a joke.

812
00:57:18,387 --> 00:57:21,424
I have real boobs
and hate spicy food.

813
00:57:22,358 --> 00:57:24,360
Now stop being such
a paranoid loser

814
00:57:24,493 --> 00:57:26,195
and tell me what happened.

815
00:57:29,398 --> 00:57:30,433
You smell so good.

816
00:57:32,268 --> 00:57:33,469
You feel so good.

817
00:57:35,705 --> 00:57:36,872
Taste so good.

818
00:57:39,508 --> 00:57:41,444
You're perfect, you know that?

819
00:57:46,349 --> 00:57:49,218
I wanna crawl inside
you and never come out.

820
00:57:52,989 --> 00:57:53,823
Okay.

821
00:58:02,164 --> 00:58:03,633
Here's something I don't get.

822
00:58:03,766 --> 00:58:05,234
If you and Carmen
fight all the time

823
00:58:05,368 --> 00:58:07,503
then how does you staying
married help Esme?

824
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:14,477
Wouldn't it be better
to get divorced now

825
00:58:15,277 --> 00:58:16,879
before you mess her up for life?

826
00:58:18,146 --> 00:58:19,147
It's an excellent question.

827
00:58:19,281 --> 00:58:21,149
Yes, I'm aware of that.

828
00:58:24,787 --> 00:58:26,656
I wish I had an
excellent answer.

829
00:58:33,929 --> 00:58:37,867
You know, I'm not asking
for myself, I promise.

830
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,604
I just want you to be
happy, and Esme, too.

831
00:58:42,471 --> 00:58:43,706
What about Carmen?

832
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,042
She can suffer.

833
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:55,584
Okay.

834
00:58:55,718 --> 00:59:00,356
The real reason I don't divorce
her is quite humiliating.

835
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:02,525
For who?

836
00:59:02,658 --> 00:59:03,659
Whom?

837
00:59:03,793 --> 00:59:04,627
For me.

838
00:59:09,532 --> 00:59:12,268
If we get divorced she'll
take half of everything,

839
00:59:12,401 --> 00:59:14,470
which means En Garde goes under.

840
00:59:18,607 --> 00:59:20,476
So you care more
about your business

841
00:59:20,609 --> 00:59:22,311
than your own happiness?

842
00:59:23,379 --> 00:59:24,380
Honestly?

843
00:59:25,047 --> 00:59:25,881
I...

844
00:59:27,683 --> 00:59:29,385
I doubt I'll ever be happy.

845
00:59:30,152 --> 00:59:31,587
Not in this lifetime, anyway.

846
00:59:32,788 --> 00:59:36,559
I want to be secure, own
a business I'm proud of.

847
00:59:54,477 --> 00:59:57,580
The
letter U instead Y-O-U.

848
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:00,249
No question mark.

849
01:00:00,382 --> 01:00:01,684
But the weirdest
thing was that Dave

850
01:00:01,817 --> 01:00:05,588
would never say fucking,
always making love.

851
01:00:10,993 --> 01:00:13,863
Oh no,
the bitch stole his phone.

852
01:00:16,265 --> 01:00:18,334
100%, I knew it.

853
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:23,439
It was a trap.

854
01:00:23,572 --> 01:00:24,874
Definitely.

855
01:00:27,576 --> 01:00:29,545
But maybe also a gift.

856
01:00:33,183 --> 01:00:35,084
An opportunity.

857
01:00:35,218 --> 01:00:37,353
An open door in my jail cell.

858
01:00:38,454 --> 01:00:40,456
I might never get a
chance like this again

859
01:00:40,589 --> 01:00:42,892
and no one could
blame me for escaping.

860
01:00:44,227 --> 01:00:46,629
How was I supposed to know
the text wasn't from him?

861
01:00:49,131 --> 01:00:53,803
I'm only happy when
you're inside me.

862
01:00:55,504 --> 01:00:58,374
God, how I love you, David.

863
01:00:59,108 --> 01:01:03,946
Come over again tonight.

864
01:01:04,613 --> 01:01:06,715
Oh, shit.

865
01:01:07,683 --> 01:01:09,018
You're my hero.

866
01:01:18,727 --> 01:01:19,528
Hello?

867
01:01:19,662 --> 01:01:21,397
Did you just text me?

868
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:23,866
Well, I mean, I
responded back to you.

869
01:01:23,999 --> 01:01:26,535
Shit, what
did my text say?

870
01:01:26,669 --> 01:01:27,937
You don't remember?

871
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:29,405
Quick, tell me.

872
01:01:29,538 --> 01:01:31,807
You said that you loved
fucking me last night

873
01:01:31,941 --> 01:01:33,909
and that you wanted
to do it again.

874
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:35,611
I said tonight.

875
01:01:35,744 --> 01:01:37,346
No, no,
Carmen wrote it.

876
01:01:37,479 --> 01:01:39,048
She stole my phone.

877
01:01:39,182 --> 01:01:41,318
I'm trying to talk my way out
of it, I'll call you later.

878
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:43,352
Don't, Dave.

879
01:01:43,485 --> 01:01:44,753
What?

880
01:01:44,887 --> 01:01:47,224
Listen to me, take
care of your family.

881
01:01:47,356 --> 01:01:48,958
Forget about me, I mean it.

882
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:51,427
I quit.

883
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,494
What? No.

884
01:01:52,628 --> 01:01:53,662
Listen, you're not gonna...

885
01:02:10,579 --> 01:02:12,448
I was
so excited to move on

886
01:02:12,581 --> 01:02:13,682
that it never occurred

887
01:02:13,816 --> 01:02:15,985
to me that Connor
would find out.

888
01:02:18,355 --> 01:02:19,989
I'm sorry that I let you down.

889
01:02:24,126 --> 01:02:27,596
I kinda assumed that you'd
be a bit more pissed off.

890
01:02:29,598 --> 01:02:30,733
Listen.

891
01:02:31,967 --> 01:02:33,736
Dave gets most of the blame.

892
01:02:36,339 --> 01:02:38,807
He's older, he's married.

893
01:02:39,808 --> 01:02:41,543
He was your employer.

894
01:02:42,945 --> 01:02:46,415
You know, if you wanna
sue him my friend

895
01:02:46,548 --> 01:02:47,750
would be happy to take the case.

896
01:02:47,883 --> 01:02:48,717
No, no.

897
01:02:50,519 --> 01:02:51,921
He's a good guy.

898
01:02:53,489 --> 01:02:55,958
He's just really unhappy.

899
01:02:57,394 --> 01:02:58,194
And...

900
01:03:00,263 --> 01:03:01,630
It's on both of us.

901
01:03:01,764 --> 01:03:04,133
I could've prevented it.

902
01:03:08,405 --> 01:03:12,309
Anyway, um, I know
somebody who will hire you.

903
01:03:13,209 --> 01:03:15,178
The pay is really
shitty, but the uniform

904
01:03:15,312 --> 01:03:17,780
is really unflattering so
nobody will hit on you.

905
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:23,052
Thank you.

906
01:03:25,554 --> 01:03:26,922
Oh, Katie.

907
01:03:27,056 --> 01:03:30,926
So much pain seeing
myself in your words.

908
01:03:32,127 --> 01:03:34,463
What I wouldn't give
to reclaim just one

909
01:03:34,596 --> 01:03:36,465
tick tock of my youth.

910
01:03:39,101 --> 01:03:40,403
It's
the first time you didn't

911
01:03:40,536 --> 01:03:41,804
write back after
one of my emails.

912
01:03:43,173 --> 01:03:44,240
Did something happen?

913
01:03:45,841 --> 01:03:47,543
Finally had enough of me?

914
01:03:51,448 --> 01:03:53,015
Ready for a little uplift?

915
01:04:00,789 --> 01:04:02,758
And as views
of his miraculous power

916
01:04:02,891 --> 01:04:06,762
spread across the land
the people delivered

917
01:04:06,895 --> 01:04:10,933
unto our lord the
cripple, the blind,

918
01:04:12,134 --> 01:04:16,839
those wracked by pain,
tormented by seizures,

919
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:20,009
even those possessed by demons.

920
01:04:25,215 --> 01:04:27,716
Sorry I disappeared.

921
01:04:27,850 --> 01:04:30,453
Kevin walked up behind me
while I was on my computer,

922
01:04:30,586 --> 01:04:34,190
he asked who I was writing
to and I had no choice.

923
01:04:34,324 --> 01:04:35,557
I told him the truth.

924
01:04:36,259 --> 01:04:38,495
About you, about my book.

925
01:04:38,627 --> 01:04:39,862
He freaked out.

926
01:04:40,896 --> 01:04:42,232
He thinks the fact that
you won't meet me in person

927
01:04:42,365 --> 01:04:44,800
means you're a dude
who wants to rape me.

928
01:04:45,934 --> 01:04:48,204
But even if he's wrong
he said he still hates

929
01:04:48,338 --> 01:04:50,639
your guts because I
kept you a secret.

930
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:58,113
Anyway, he made me promise
never to write you again.

931
01:04:58,248 --> 01:04:59,748
I lied and said okay.

932
01:05:00,849 --> 01:05:03,886
Like I'd ever let a man
control my existence.

933
01:05:04,753 --> 01:05:05,888
He should know better.

934
01:05:07,623 --> 01:05:08,757
Go on with your story.

935
01:05:08,891 --> 01:05:10,592
Please tell me Dave was history.

936
01:05:10,726 --> 01:05:12,661
The chosen
will banish the demons,

937
01:05:12,795 --> 01:05:16,031
speak in new tongues,
bring the word of God

938
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:18,301
to every corner of the earth.

939
01:05:21,637 --> 01:05:22,805
I hoped so.

940
01:05:22,938 --> 01:05:25,308
I went to work every
day and every day

941
01:05:25,442 --> 01:05:27,910
I missed him less and less.

942
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,249
Elle!

943
01:05:38,821 --> 01:05:40,923
We should talk, right?

944
01:05:42,825 --> 01:05:45,528
Actually, we were all
pretty jazzed Carmen

945
01:05:45,661 --> 01:05:46,762
finally busted him.

946
01:05:46,895 --> 01:05:49,098
I thought that
you all love Dave.

947
01:05:49,232 --> 01:05:53,735
We do, we just hate that he
sleeps with his assistants.

948
01:05:53,869 --> 01:05:55,704
Hopefully that's over now.

949
01:05:55,838 --> 01:05:57,940
We can all finally
look Carmen in the eye.

950
01:06:01,677 --> 01:06:02,711
Oh.

951
01:06:04,113 --> 01:06:07,183
You thought you were
like the first one?

952
01:06:11,086 --> 01:06:11,920
No.

953
01:06:14,022 --> 01:06:14,957
How...

954
01:06:15,858 --> 01:06:17,293
How many others?

955
01:06:19,695 --> 01:06:21,197
All of them, really.

956
01:06:22,165 --> 01:06:24,167
Except for the one
that was born male.

957
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,702
Dave didn't know that
when he hired her.

958
01:06:27,537 --> 01:06:28,538
What about the last one?

959
01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:30,173
The gum chewer?

960
01:06:30,306 --> 01:06:30,973
Yeah.

961
01:06:31,106 --> 01:06:32,841
She got super attached.

962
01:06:32,975 --> 01:06:35,278
She went psycho and
moved back to Florida.

963
01:06:37,347 --> 01:06:38,515
Hey, hey.

964
01:06:38,647 --> 01:06:39,748
Don't freak out.

965
01:06:40,816 --> 01:06:41,984
You won.

966
01:06:42,985 --> 01:06:45,787
You are young and
gorgeous and you have

967
01:06:45,921 --> 01:06:47,656
your whole life ahead of you.

968
01:06:49,958 --> 01:06:52,328
He has to go straight home
to Carmen every night.

969
01:06:52,462 --> 01:06:54,763
He's not allowed to
travel without her,

970
01:06:54,897 --> 01:06:57,099
she even picked out
his new assistant.

971
01:06:57,233 --> 01:06:59,169
Why doesn't she
just divorce him?

972
01:07:00,135 --> 01:07:00,969
Well, she probably
would if she knew

973
01:07:01,103 --> 01:07:02,305
the truth about you guys.

974
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:06,074
But he told Carmen you guys
only slept together once.

975
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:10,012
He said he did it because
he felt sorry for you.

976
01:07:18,053 --> 01:07:19,922
How do you know so much?

977
01:07:21,424 --> 01:07:25,395
I'm smarter than Dave, so
he isn't attracted to me.

978
01:07:27,163 --> 01:07:29,798
But that also means he
tells me everything.

979
01:07:35,137 --> 01:07:37,473
I'm sorry.

980
01:07:38,374 --> 01:07:40,008
Are you? Really?

981
01:07:42,978 --> 01:07:45,147
Why doesn't he just divorce her?

982
01:07:45,281 --> 01:07:46,649
I mean, is he really
so scared about losing

983
01:07:46,782 --> 01:07:47,883
half of his money?

984
01:07:48,917 --> 01:07:50,587
What do you mean?

985
01:07:50,719 --> 01:07:52,020
He loses all of it.

986
01:07:53,755 --> 01:07:55,090
He signed a prenup.

987
01:07:55,225 --> 01:07:57,460
If they get a divorce
he doesn't get a cent.

988
01:07:57,594 --> 01:07:59,395
No, what about his trust?

989
01:08:01,129 --> 01:08:02,665
Is that what he told you?

990
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:07,237
No, she comes from one of the
richest families in El Paso.

991
01:08:08,971 --> 01:08:10,939
Her dad bankrolls the company.

992
01:08:11,073 --> 01:08:12,941
He even helped him
get his green card.

993
01:08:13,075 --> 01:08:16,812
When she met him he was
literally selling used cars.

994
01:08:23,453 --> 01:08:24,287
Hey.

995
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:28,857
What did Molly tell you?

996
01:08:28,991 --> 01:08:30,792
Are you stalking me now?

997
01:08:33,028 --> 01:08:35,964
You know, I should be
angry at you for hiring me

998
01:08:36,098 --> 01:08:37,799
just so you could fuck me,

999
01:08:39,502 --> 01:08:42,238
but I'm so insane I'm
weirdly flattered.

1000
01:08:42,372 --> 01:08:46,476
But what I can't forgive
is what a liar you are.

1001
01:08:47,644 --> 01:08:50,879
Carmen isn't a gold
digging whore, you are.

1002
01:08:52,047 --> 01:08:53,449
You make me sick.

1003
01:08:55,017 --> 01:08:56,818
Stop, wait, please.

1004
01:08:56,952 --> 01:08:58,254
Just let me say something.

1005
01:08:59,188 --> 01:09:00,956
Look, no matter what
happened before,

1006
01:09:01,089 --> 01:09:02,458
it was different with us.

1007
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,094
We had something special, Elle.

1008
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:07,330
I go to sleep and I miss you,

1009
01:09:07,463 --> 01:09:09,465
I wake up and my
life, it's empty.

1010
01:09:10,932 --> 01:09:12,568
I need you, Elle.

1011
01:09:14,903 --> 01:09:15,937
I love you.

1012
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:20,343
Carmen's with her parents
on Saturday night.

1013
01:09:21,244 --> 01:09:24,247
Have dinner with me, please.

1014
01:09:28,751 --> 01:09:29,585
I can't.

1015
01:09:33,121 --> 01:09:34,490
I have a hot date.

1016
01:09:37,193 --> 01:09:38,860
I
had no idea that cruelty

1017
01:09:38,994 --> 01:09:41,063
could feel so good.

1018
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,203
Do you have any tall,
gorgeous male friends?

1019
01:09:47,337 --> 01:09:48,171
Sure.

1020
01:09:49,405 --> 01:09:50,906
Black?

1021
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:52,308
Yeah, of course.

1022
01:09:52,442 --> 01:09:53,609
Straight?

1023
01:09:53,743 --> 01:09:55,545
Ah, can't help you there.

1024
01:09:55,678 --> 01:09:56,845
No.

1025
01:09:56,978 --> 01:09:58,181
So you're not
racist, you're just-

1026
01:09:58,314 --> 01:09:59,682
- Heterophobic, yeah.

1027
01:09:59,816 --> 01:10:00,882
Yeah, breeders?

1028
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:07,923
What about a tall
gorgeous black male friend

1029
01:10:08,056 --> 01:10:10,859
that can pass as straight?

1030
01:10:10,992 --> 01:10:13,296
Oh, my God.

1031
01:10:13,429 --> 01:10:14,330
I love it.

1032
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:18,501
Why is
it no matter how liberal

1033
01:10:18,634 --> 01:10:21,002
a white guy is, when
it comes to a black guy

1034
01:10:21,136 --> 01:10:23,673
boning his girl he
goes full Albright?

1035
01:10:24,707 --> 01:10:25,842
I
think it's 'cause of

1036
01:10:25,974 --> 01:10:27,377
the true myth about black dicks.

1037
01:10:28,711 --> 01:10:31,146
Maybe deep
down they wanna suck one.

1038
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,048
Don't we all.

1039
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:36,619
Oh, hey, gorgeous.

1040
01:10:38,221 --> 01:10:39,422
Back at ya, blue eyes.

1041
01:10:41,424 --> 01:10:43,058
It's just on the hill,
do you mind if we walk?

1042
01:10:43,192 --> 01:10:44,227
I prefer it.

1043
01:10:46,396 --> 01:10:48,164
Don't look
now, but he's across

1044
01:10:48,297 --> 01:10:49,931
the street stalking us.

1045
01:10:50,065 --> 01:10:51,634
Don't worry, he's not dangerous.

1046
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:55,036
I'm not worried about a thing.

1047
01:10:55,171 --> 01:10:57,072
You're smooth.

1048
01:10:57,206 --> 01:11:00,075
I minored in theater at
Arizona State University.

1049
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:02,578
Is he live tweeting this?

1050
01:11:02,712 --> 01:11:04,547
No, he's texting me.

1051
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,215
It's working.

1052
01:11:06,349 --> 01:11:07,183
Mute!

1053
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:10,686
By the way, adore
the Miu Miu Slingbacks.

1054
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:12,889
Well, thank you,
Connor picked them out.

1055
01:11:13,021 --> 01:11:14,390
Figured.

1056
01:11:14,524 --> 01:11:15,991
Why, because the rest
of my outfit is shit?

1057
01:11:16,124 --> 01:11:17,660
Oh, great.

1058
01:11:21,129 --> 01:11:22,931
Did locusts attack these?

1059
01:11:24,167 --> 01:11:25,435
This is unacceptable.

1060
01:11:26,402 --> 01:11:28,671
It's time for you to
woman the hell up.

1061
01:11:28,805 --> 01:11:30,306
You're not a teenager anymore.

1062
01:11:31,407 --> 01:11:32,941
What do you suggest?

1063
01:11:34,109 --> 01:11:36,179
"La French" as
the French call it,

1064
01:11:36,312 --> 01:11:38,046
even though we invented it.

1065
01:11:38,881 --> 01:11:41,284
Pale pink base, white tip.

1066
01:11:41,417 --> 01:11:45,421
Womanly, sophisticated,
timeless.

1067
01:11:46,155 --> 01:11:47,290
Well, that's me.

1068
01:11:48,391 --> 01:11:49,892
And leave these
poor cuticles alone.

1069
01:11:50,025 --> 01:11:52,628
If you're angry, chew
out other people.

1070
01:11:55,531 --> 01:11:56,833
Wow.

1071
01:11:56,965 --> 01:11:58,634
You should be a life coach.

1072
01:11:58,768 --> 01:12:00,169
Connor didn't tell you?

1073
01:12:00,837 --> 01:12:02,070
It's what I am.

1074
01:12:10,179 --> 01:12:12,147
You know, if you
were into vagina

1075
01:12:12,281 --> 01:12:14,584
this night would
definitely not be over.

1076
01:12:14,717 --> 01:12:16,017
At least, I'd hope not.

1077
01:12:16,151 --> 01:12:18,387
Oh, we'd just be
getting started.

1078
01:12:26,061 --> 01:12:27,263
Thank you.

1079
01:12:32,535 --> 01:12:34,337
- Goodnight.
- Yeah.

1080
01:13:34,664 --> 01:13:36,499
While
he was sending them

1081
01:13:36,632 --> 01:13:38,634
Carmen was probably
on her way home

1082
01:13:38,768 --> 01:13:40,636
ready to crawl
into bed with him.

1083
01:13:42,137 --> 01:13:43,439
Carmen, who believed he had sex

1084
01:13:43,573 --> 01:13:45,841
with me only once out of pity.

1085
01:13:48,811 --> 01:13:50,846
I didn't forward her
the dirtiest ones,

1086
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:54,417
just the ones where it was
really obvious we were in love.

1087
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:58,421
Did you write anything?

1088
01:13:59,488 --> 01:14:01,089
I kept it simple.

1089
01:14:01,223 --> 01:14:04,627
Dave just sent me
these, I'm moving on.

1090
01:14:05,394 --> 01:14:06,495
Why can't he?

1091
01:14:27,316 --> 01:14:28,718
Come in.

1092
01:14:34,256 --> 01:14:35,291
Stay.

1093
01:14:36,292 --> 01:14:37,460
What's wrong?

1094
01:14:40,997 --> 01:14:42,465
I just spoke to Dave.

1095
01:14:44,266 --> 01:14:45,301
He's in jail.

1096
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:48,571
What? What happened?

1097
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:54,343
When you sent the photos
to Carmen she kicked him out.

1098
01:14:56,012 --> 01:14:57,780
Told him that he'd
hear from her lawyer.

1099
01:14:57,913 --> 01:15:00,483
And then she threatened
to move away with Esme.

1100
01:15:02,685 --> 01:15:04,086
He can't explained
what happened next.

1101
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:07,590
"Something snapped", he said.

1102
01:15:09,992 --> 01:15:13,529
What did he do?

1103
01:15:13,663 --> 01:15:15,464
He beat the shit out of her.

1104
01:15:16,565 --> 01:15:18,801
She's in intensive
care at St. Luke's.

1105
01:15:19,535 --> 01:15:21,203
Fractured skull, broken jaw,

1106
01:15:21,337 --> 01:15:22,772
one of her implants
has ruptured.

1107
01:15:22,905 --> 01:15:24,907
Esme saw the whole
thing from the landing.

1108
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:25,875
Oh, my God.

1109
01:15:26,776 --> 01:15:29,278
Lucky for you,
he's pleading guilty.

1110
01:15:29,412 --> 01:15:31,180
He won't contest the divorce,

1111
01:15:31,313 --> 01:15:33,282
he won't contest
the sole custody.

1112
01:15:35,418 --> 01:15:36,519
That means no trial.

1113
01:15:38,688 --> 01:15:40,256
You won't get dragged into it.

1114
01:15:40,389 --> 01:15:41,524
Thank god.

1115
01:15:42,992 --> 01:15:44,527
But I'm finished with you.

1116
01:15:45,995 --> 01:15:46,829
No.

1117
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:48,964
No, please.

1118
01:15:49,098 --> 01:15:50,399
Please, I'm sorry.

1119
01:15:50,533 --> 01:15:52,635
You had every right
to lash out on him.

1120
01:15:55,337 --> 01:15:56,539
But not to his family.

1121
01:15:58,407 --> 01:16:01,243
Carmen did nothing
to you, nothing.

1122
01:16:01,377 --> 01:16:02,545
Esme did nothing to you.

1123
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:08,918
You're dangerous, Elle.

1124
01:16:11,587 --> 01:16:14,690
You're ruled by your obsessions,
you have no self control.

1125
01:16:19,562 --> 01:16:22,631
Go home, get help,

1126
01:16:25,101 --> 01:16:26,368
figure your shit out.

1127
01:16:40,549 --> 01:16:43,853
I had no idea that Dave
was capable of violence.

1128
01:16:46,789 --> 01:16:47,857
Like my dad.

1129
01:16:50,092 --> 01:16:52,128
Like my mom's godson
Leon after he pinned

1130
01:16:52,261 --> 01:16:53,696
me down when I was seven.

1131
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:57,167
Like Dad who couldn't
go more than a few weeks

1132
01:16:57,299 --> 01:16:58,634
without hitting me.

1133
01:16:59,802 --> 01:17:01,904
You're breaking my heart.

1134
01:17:05,274 --> 01:17:06,308
I'm sorry.

1135
01:17:08,043 --> 01:17:09,512
Kevin's taking Sarah

1136
01:17:09,645 --> 01:17:11,447
to his parent's in
Michigan this weekend.

1137
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:14,016
Let's meet up finally.

1138
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:15,284
Please.

1139
01:17:16,118 --> 01:17:17,620
It's time to trust again.

1140
01:17:18,587 --> 01:17:19,955
Let me take care of you.

1141
01:17:22,391 --> 01:17:23,592
Why are you always
looking backwards?

1142
01:17:23,726 --> 01:17:25,995
You need to dwell on the future.

1143
01:17:26,128 --> 01:17:27,463
Pick a dream, make it come true.

1144
01:17:27,596 --> 01:17:29,932
I don't know, it just
feels like sometimes

1145
01:17:30,065 --> 01:17:32,235
like no mater what
I do I always end up

1146
01:17:32,368 --> 01:17:34,303
with a guy who hates women.

1147
01:17:34,436 --> 01:17:38,507
Like I can't help it, like
it's my destiny or something.

1148
01:17:38,641 --> 01:17:40,177
You know that's bullshit.

1149
01:17:40,309 --> 01:17:41,710
There's good men everywhere.

1150
01:17:42,511 --> 01:17:44,547
Well, okay, not everywhere.

1151
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:48,484
But they're around and
you just don't see them.

1152
01:17:48,617 --> 01:17:50,820
And you won't until you
get your mind right.

1153
01:17:53,256 --> 01:17:55,057
What, like medication?

1154
01:17:55,192 --> 01:17:59,395
Or yoga or therapy or church.

1155
01:17:59,528 --> 01:18:01,363
Or maybe you hug
kids with cancer.

1156
01:18:03,132 --> 01:18:05,935
You just need to stop
expecting a man to save you.

1157
01:18:07,069 --> 01:18:08,737
It's just you, Elle.

1158
01:18:08,871 --> 01:18:09,905
Nobody else.

1159
01:18:10,739 --> 01:18:13,676
Hard work, the journey inward.

1160
01:18:19,949 --> 01:18:23,686
You know, I'm gonna
miss our run on Saturday.

1161
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:25,754
I'm going out Friday
night and I'm expecting

1162
01:18:25,888 --> 01:18:27,690
to have a massive hangover.

1163
01:18:28,657 --> 01:18:29,825
Is it a date?

1164
01:18:32,162 --> 01:18:33,362
Yeah.

1165
01:18:46,408 --> 01:18:47,277
I'm on my way.

1166
01:18:47,409 --> 01:18:48,844
I didn't tell anyone.

1167
01:18:48,978 --> 01:18:49,812
What about you?

1168
01:18:54,950 --> 01:18:56,886
Remember, exit 26B,

1169
01:18:57,019 --> 01:18:59,421
on the left as soon
as you get off.

1170
01:18:59,555 --> 01:19:01,523
It's a bar that
used to be a diner.

1171
01:19:01,657 --> 01:19:03,525
Amazing martinis.

1172
01:19:03,659 --> 01:19:04,994
You can't miss the neon.

1173
01:19:24,381 --> 01:19:26,882
Oh, I booked us rooms
at the motel next door

1174
01:19:27,016 --> 01:19:28,851
in case we get too
drunk to drive.

1175
01:19:28,984 --> 01:19:31,754
I know, how responsible
and mature of me.

1176
01:21:08,385 --> 01:21:09,219
Katie?

1177
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:11,421
Um, I'm sorry.

1178
01:21:26,769 --> 01:21:28,171
In back.

1179
01:21:43,453 --> 01:21:44,720
What can I get you?

1180
01:21:44,853 --> 01:21:46,722
One of your world
famous martinis, please.

1181
01:21:47,756 --> 01:21:48,857
How old are you?

1182
01:21:48,991 --> 01:21:49,792
21.

1183
01:21:52,094 --> 01:21:53,695
I believe you.

1184
01:22:01,404 --> 01:22:02,938
The
place is almost empty

1185
01:22:03,072 --> 01:22:06,276
except for a bored
couple, fat bartender,

1186
01:22:06,409 --> 01:22:09,878
a tired waitress and a
creepy dude who keeps on

1187
01:22:10,012 --> 01:22:12,215
trying to get the
courage to talk to me.

1188
01:22:12,948 --> 01:22:14,917
Hurry up before he succeeds.

1189
01:22:21,857 --> 01:22:23,992
- Where are you, dude?
- Thank you.

1190
01:22:26,229 --> 01:22:27,297
Thanks.

1191
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:28,431
I'm starting to worry

1192
01:22:28,565 --> 01:22:29,064
that you punked out.

1193
01:22:30,366 --> 01:22:32,701
Or maybe before Kevin
left he handcuffed

1194
01:22:32,835 --> 01:22:33,936
you to the stove.

1195
01:22:46,483 --> 01:22:47,317
Shit.

1196
01:22:59,795 --> 01:23:01,663
Raining, fuck.

1197
01:23:03,098 --> 01:23:03,966
Get here.

1198
01:23:08,204 --> 01:23:11,073
I'm way
too drunk to drive.

1199
01:23:11,207 --> 01:23:13,075
Why don't I have
your phone number?

1200
01:23:13,209 --> 01:23:16,645
Right, it's your stupid
jealous husband's fault.

1201
01:23:17,646 --> 01:23:19,715
You know, if they really
think that we're such whores

1202
01:23:19,848 --> 01:23:21,417
then why are they even with us?

1203
01:23:23,353 --> 01:23:26,389
It makes me sick that Kevin
made you keep me a secret.

1204
01:23:26,523 --> 01:23:27,624
He's a jerk.

1205
01:23:27,756 --> 01:23:29,725
Yeah, I know, I'm a bitch.

1206
01:23:30,859 --> 01:23:32,495
What the hell happened to you?

1207
01:23:32,629 --> 01:23:34,230
Did you get into a car accident?

1208
01:24:10,567 --> 01:24:12,734
Can I help you?

1209
01:24:12,868 --> 01:24:14,170
Yes.

1210
01:24:14,304 --> 01:24:17,039
Do you have a reservation
for an Elle Overton?

1211
01:24:19,275 --> 01:24:21,043
Um, nope.

1212
01:24:23,646 --> 01:24:24,480
Really? Okay.

1213
01:24:25,315 --> 01:24:27,617
- Wow.
- Oh, oh, wait, wait.

1214
01:24:27,749 --> 01:24:28,750
Yeah, sorry.

1215
01:24:28,884 --> 01:24:30,587
E. Overton, yep.

1216
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:31,753
Paid in full.

1217
01:24:33,956 --> 01:24:37,627
And is it just for myself?

1218
01:24:37,759 --> 01:24:40,963
Um, single, smoking.

1219
01:24:41,930 --> 01:24:43,233
I'd have to see some ID.

1220
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:45,235
Right.

1221
01:24:46,603 --> 01:24:47,736
Oh, sorry.

1222
01:24:47,869 --> 01:24:49,071
There you go.

1223
01:24:53,742 --> 01:24:55,211
Here we go.

1224
01:24:55,345 --> 01:24:58,814
Checkout's at 11, room is
right down there on the left.

1225
01:25:01,251 --> 01:25:03,319
And did she get
a room for herself?

1226
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:06,222
Right next door.

1227
01:25:07,990 --> 01:25:09,758
Is there a door between them?

1228
01:25:10,493 --> 01:25:11,327
Nope.

1229
01:25:14,997 --> 01:25:17,065
Is she in there right now?

1230
01:25:17,933 --> 01:25:19,101
Nope.

1231
01:25:23,005 --> 01:25:24,574
Thank you, thanks.

1232
01:25:24,707 --> 01:25:26,008
Enjoy.

1233
01:26:52,261 --> 01:26:53,995
I'm in the room.

1234
01:26:54,129 --> 01:26:55,365
It's not bad.

1235
01:26:55,498 --> 01:26:57,300
I can't let you
pay for it, though,

1236
01:26:57,433 --> 01:27:00,536
especially since I'm leaving
as soon as I'm okay to drive.

1237
01:28:19,147 --> 01:28:21,684
I'm here, bitch.

1238
01:28:24,152 --> 01:28:25,388
Okay.

1239
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:13,101
Dear Katie,
I've only left New Mexico

1240
01:29:13,236 --> 01:29:15,471
one time and it was
for boarding school.

1241
01:29:15,605 --> 01:29:18,039
I've never even see the ocean.

1242
01:29:18,174 --> 01:29:20,676
I want an exciting
life like yours.

1243
01:29:22,378 --> 01:29:23,212
Hi, Katie.

1244
01:29:23,346 --> 01:29:25,281
My name is Annie Dormer.

1245
01:29:25,414 --> 01:29:27,917
I feel faintly idiotic
even typing your name

1246
01:29:28,049 --> 01:29:29,418
because you're a
fictional character,

1247
01:29:29,552 --> 01:29:33,356
but I just wanted to say
I wish you were real.

1248
01:29:36,993 --> 01:29:39,060
Katie,
is this really the best

1249
01:29:39,195 --> 01:29:40,396
our society can do?

1250
01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:42,198
To treat females this way?

1251
01:29:42,331 --> 01:29:45,635
We're the world's mothers,
sisters and daughters.

1252
01:29:47,303 --> 01:29:49,070
Annie
Dormer again, I just had

1253
01:29:49,205 --> 01:29:51,139
the weirdest dream about you.

1254
01:29:51,274 --> 01:29:52,742
We were at a party, you
said that you were gonna

1255
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:54,844
have sex with this
hot guy you just met

1256
01:29:54,977 --> 01:29:56,379
and did I wanna watch?

1257
01:29:57,346 --> 01:30:02,318
I got scared because
for some reason I did.

1258
01:30:03,853 --> 01:30:06,121
Katie,
my dad died at work.

1259
01:30:06,255 --> 01:30:08,558
He was basically cut in two.

1260
01:30:08,691 --> 01:30:10,293
I don't think I even loved him,

1261
01:30:10,426 --> 01:30:14,730
but just like you, his
death scarred me for life.

1262
01:30:16,232 --> 01:30:18,801
The whole world
is drowning in lies.

1263
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:21,804
Our hearts are in constant pain

1264
01:30:22,838 --> 01:30:26,208
of a sort we can neither
identify nor feel.

1265
01:30:26,342 --> 01:30:30,479
We're not human,
just virtually human.

1266
01:30:31,581 --> 01:30:34,884
Your honest, brave,
lively spirit is just

1267
01:30:35,017 --> 01:30:36,552
what the world needs right now.

1268
01:30:37,253 --> 01:30:38,421
What I need.

1269
01:31:12,158 --> 01:31:17,158
