1
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:37,432
Where?

2
00:01:38,434 --> 00:01:40,351
I want a haircut.

3
00:01:41,103 --> 00:01:43,104
The president's in town.

4
00:01:43,314 --> 00:01:44,522
We don't care.

5
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,692
We need a haircut.
We need to go across town.

6
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:52,030
We'll hit traffic that
speaks in quarter inches.

7
00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:55,200
Just so I know...

8
00:01:55,284 --> 00:01:57,452
...which president
are we talking about?

9
00:01:57,453 --> 00:01:59,704
United States.

10
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,581
Barriers will be setup.

11
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:04,626
Entire streets deleted
from the map.

12
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:08,379
Show me my car.

13
00:02:14,303 --> 00:02:15,470
What have we learned then?

14
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:18,139
Our system is secure.
We're impenetrable.

15
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:19,933
There's no rogue program.

16
00:02:20,226 --> 00:02:21,768
It would seem, however...

17
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:24,312
- Eric!
- No, we ran every test.

18
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:28,399
No one's overloading the
system or manipulating our sites.

19
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,692
When do we do all this?

20
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:30,485
Yesterday.

21
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:32,820
At the complex, our rapid response team.

22
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:35,490
There is no vulnerable point of entry.

23
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:37,909
Our insurer did a threat analysis.

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,577
We are buffered from attack.

25
00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:40,286
Everywhere.

26
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:41,120
Yes.

27
00:02:41,413 --> 00:02:42,705
Including the car?

28
00:02:43,374 --> 00:02:45,083
Including, absolutely, yes.

29
00:02:45,084 --> 00:02:46,292
My car, this car...

30
00:02:46,293 --> 00:02:48,378
Eric, yes! Please...

31
00:02:50,798 --> 00:02:55,009
We've been together, you and I,
since the little-bitty startup.

32
00:02:55,177 --> 00:02:59,013
I want you to tell me that
you still have the stamina to do this job.

33
00:02:59,431 --> 00:03:00,390
Single mindedness.

34
00:03:00,391 --> 00:03:02,475
This car, your car...

35
00:03:02,476 --> 00:03:04,561
The relentless will.

36
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:07,438
'cause I keep hearing
about our legend

37
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,775
that we were young,
smart and raised by wolves

38
00:03:10,776 --> 00:03:12,861
that the phenomena of reputation

39
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:16,239
is a delicate thing.
Person rises on a word

40
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,867
and falls on a syllable.

41
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:21,995
I know I'm asking the wrong man.

42
00:03:21,996 --> 00:03:23,079
Oh, what?

43
00:03:23,706 --> 00:03:26,541
Where's the car last night
after we ran our tests?

44
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,459
I...

45
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:31,629
I don't know.

46
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:37,468
Where do all these limos go at night?

47
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:39,971
I know I'm changing the subject.

48
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:41,472
Haven't been sleeping much.

49
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:43,558
I look at books and drink brandy.

50
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:48,479
What happens to all these stretched
limousines that prowl the throbbing city all day long?

51
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,231
Where do they spend the night?

52
00:03:57,698 --> 00:04:02,076
Do you ever get the feeling, sometimes,
that you don't know what's going on?

53
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,915
Do I wanna ask you what you mean by that?

54
00:04:06,916 --> 00:04:09,501
All this optimism

55
00:04:09,585 --> 00:04:11,669
All this booming and soaring.

56
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,716
Things happen like...
bang! This! And that! Simultaneous.

57
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:19,844
I put out my hand
and what do I feel?

58
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,058
I know there are a thousand things
that you analyze every 10 minutes

59
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:30,438
patterns, ratio, indexes,
whole maps of information.

60
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:33,358
I love information.

61
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:36,903
Eric, this is our
sweetness and light.

62
00:04:36,904 --> 00:04:39,364
It is a fuckall wonder

63
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:41,866
and we have meaning
in this world

64
00:04:42,743 --> 00:04:47,831
people eat and sleep in
the shadow of what we do.

65
00:04:49,124 --> 00:04:50,959
But at the same time

66
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,044
What?

67
00:04:57,424 --> 00:05:01,553
Any special reason we're in
the car instead of the office?

68
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:03,638
What makes you think we're
in the car instead of the office?

69
00:05:03,806 --> 00:05:05,515
If I answer that question...

70
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:06,641
Based on what premise?

71
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:11,521
I know I'll say something
that's half-way clever, but... also shallow

72
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:14,357
and probably inaccurate on some level

73
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:17,902
and then you will pity me
for having been born.

74
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:19,988
We're in the car 'cause
I need a haircut.

75
00:05:19,989 --> 00:05:22,490
Get the barber come to the
office, get a haircut there

76
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:25,243
or have the barber come
to your car, just...

77
00:05:25,244 --> 00:05:27,829
get your haircut and
go to the office.

78
00:05:27,997 --> 00:05:31,666
A haircut has what?
Associations

79
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:34,210
Calendar on the wall,
mirrors everywhere.

80
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:38,214
There's no barber chair here.
Nothing swivels but chair your in, Shiner.

81
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,445
Where's your car?

82
00:06:02,072 --> 00:06:05,408
We can't seem to find it.

83
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:07,160
I'd offer you a ride.

84
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:10,246
I couldn't. Absolutely.

85
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:12,332
I know you work enroute.

86
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,751
and I like taxis.

87
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:20,089
I was never good at geography and I
learned things by asking the drivers where they come from.

88
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,759
They come from horror and despair.

89
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:25,261
Yes, exactly.

90
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:30,767
One learns about the country where
unrest is occurring by riding the taxis here.

91
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:34,729
I haven't seen you in a while.

92
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:40,818
I looked for you this morning.

93
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:44,280
Your eyes are blue.

94
00:06:45,324 --> 00:06:47,158
Have you eat breakfast yet?

95
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,244
No.

96
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,249
Good. I'm hungry for
something thick and chewy.

97
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:58,002
You never told me you were blue eyed.

98
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:01,130
When are we going to talk about?

99
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:04,634
I want a heliboard on the roof.

100
00:07:05,177 --> 00:07:08,388
I've acquired the air rights,
but we still need the zoning variants.

101
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:09,806
Don't you wanna eat?

102
00:07:10,474 --> 00:07:13,017
There's a shooting range
next to the elevator bank.

103
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,354
Let's talk about us.

104
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:18,022
You and I?

105
00:07:18,274 --> 00:07:20,441
We're here so we might as well.

106
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,027
When are we going
to have sex again?

107
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:27,156
We will, I promise.

108
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:30,368
We haven't in a while now.

109
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:33,788
When I work, you see...

110
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:36,207
the energy is precious.

111
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,293
When you write?

112
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:40,378
Yes.

113
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:43,256
Where do you do this?

114
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:45,341
I look for you, Elise.

115
00:07:45,968 --> 00:07:47,886
I curl up somewhere.

116
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,513
I've always done this.

117
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,141
My mother used to send
people to find me

118
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:57,061
maids and gardeners,
combing the house and rounds

119
00:07:57,563 --> 00:08:00,273
She thought I was
dissolvable in water.

120
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:03,276
I like your mother.

121
00:08:03,986 --> 00:08:05,987
You have your mother's breasts.

122
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:08,072
Breasts?

123
00:08:10,326 --> 00:08:12,660
Great stand-up tits.

124
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,624
Tell me this: where will you go now?

125
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:21,044
To a meeting somewhere
to your office?

126
00:08:21,045 --> 00:08:22,837
Where is your office?

127
00:08:22,838 --> 00:08:24,923
What do you do, exactly?

128
00:08:25,841 --> 00:08:28,343
You know things,
I think this is what you do.

129
00:08:29,053 --> 00:08:31,346
I think you're dedicated to knowing.

130
00:08:31,597 --> 00:08:37,268
I think you acquire information and turn it
into something stupendous and awful.

131
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,439
You're a dangerous person.
Do you agree?

132
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:44,359
A visionary.

133
00:08:55,663 --> 00:08:57,956
A report from the Complex.

134
00:08:57,957 --> 00:09:00,041
It's a credible threat,
not to be dismissed.

135
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:03,002
Which means riding cross town is...

136
00:09:03,003 --> 00:09:05,880
Had numerous threats, all credible.

137
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:07,465
I'm still standing here.

138
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:10,635
Not a threat to your safety, to his.

139
00:09:11,303 --> 00:09:13,054
Who the fuck is "his"?

140
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:16,683
The president's.
This means a ride cross town...

141
00:09:16,684 --> 00:09:20,353
does not happen unless we make
a day of it, with cookies and milk.

142
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,942
Do people still shoot at presidents?
I thought there were more stimulating targets.

143
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:32,198
In the next block, there are two
haircutting saloons, there's one and two.

144
00:09:32,783 --> 00:09:35,034
No need to go cross town

145
00:09:35,661 --> 00:09:38,079
Situation is unstable.

146
00:09:39,206 --> 00:09:40,915
Here.

147
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,296
I know that smile, Michael.

148
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:51,676
I think the yuan... I mean there's
reason to believe we may be leveraging too rashly.

149
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:53,178
It's gonna turn our way.

150
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:56,014
Yes, I know, it always has.

151
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:59,434
The rashness you think you see.

152
00:09:59,435 --> 00:10:02,103
What is happening doesn't chart.

153
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:05,064
It charts.

154
00:10:05,065 --> 00:10:11,529
You just have to search a little harder.
Don't trust standard models, think outside the limits.

155
00:10:11,947 --> 00:10:13,615
The yuan is making a statement.

156
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:15,408
Read it and leap.

157
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:18,745
We are betting big time here.

158
00:10:18,913 --> 00:10:23,750
I know that smile and I wanna respect it,
but the yuan can't go any higher.

159
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:25,210
I wanna trust it.

160
00:10:25,336 --> 00:10:27,837
We're borrowing enormous enormous sums.

161
00:10:27,838 --> 00:10:30,757
Any assault on the borders of
perception is gonna seem rash at first...

162
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:33,927
Yeah, come on, we're speculating into the void!

163
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,263
Your mother blamed the
smile on your father

164
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:39,349
he blamed her

165
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,643
there's something deadly about it

166
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:44,229
she thought she had to enroll
you in special counseling.

167
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,564
I think we ought to adjust.

168
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:51,277
Where's Shiner?

169
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:53,363
On his way to the airport.

170
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:57,283
Why are they called airports?

171
00:10:57,576 --> 00:11:01,663
I know I can't answer these questions
without losing your respect.

172
00:11:01,914 --> 00:11:04,207
Shiner told me our network is secure.

173
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,500
Then it is.

174
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:09,796
Safe from penetrations.

175
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:16,344
Why am I seeing things that
haven't happened yet?

176
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:24,686
How old are you?

177
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:30,859
What? 22!

178
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,944
You look younger.

179
00:11:33,946 --> 00:11:37,824
I was always younger than anyone
around me. One day I began to change.

180
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:40,952
I don't feel younger.

181
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:43,955
I feel located totally nowhere.

182
00:11:45,082 --> 00:11:48,501
Think I'm ready to quit,
basically the business.

183
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:52,463
Put a stick of gum in your
mouth and try not to chew it.

184
00:11:56,051 --> 00:12:01,139
For someone your age and your gifts, there's only one
thing in the world worth pursuing both professionally and intellectually.

185
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,224
What is it, Michael?

186
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:07,228
The interaction between
technology and capital

187
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:09,314
the inseparability.

188
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:12,358
Highschool was the last true challenge.

189
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:18,323
There's a poem I read in which
a rat becomes the unit of currency.

190
00:12:18,824 --> 00:12:21,618
Yes, that would be interesting.

191
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:23,453
Yeah, that would
impact the world economy.

192
00:12:23,454 --> 00:12:26,372
The name alone,
better than the dong or the kwacha.

193
00:12:26,373 --> 00:12:27,582
The name says everything.

194
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,374
Yes.

195
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,334
The rat.

196
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:32,128
Yes, the rat close lower
today against the euro.

197
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:36,007
Yes, there's going concern that
the Russian rat will be devalued.

198
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:37,759
White rats, think about that.

199
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,052
Yes, pregnant rats.

200
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:41,846
Major sell-offs of
Russian pregnant rats.

201
00:12:41,847 --> 00:12:43,598
Britain converts the rat.

202
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:45,433
Joins trend to universal currency.

203
00:12:45,434 --> 00:12:47,227
Yes, US is establishing
the rat standard.

204
00:12:47,228 --> 00:12:50,188
Is every US dollar
redeemable for rat?

205
00:12:51,273 --> 00:12:53,149
Dead rats!

206
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:56,027
Yes, stockpiling of dead rats called

207
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,530
global health menace.

208
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:04,869
How old are you, now that
you're not younger than everyone else?

209
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:44,868
Was I expecting you?

210
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:47,328
Just passing by.

211
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:51,833
Thought you'd drop in, did you?
That's nice. I'm glad.

212
00:13:52,334 --> 00:13:54,502
Been a while.

213
00:13:58,465 --> 00:13:59,966
I read about it.

214
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:03,845
Of course. Or did I see it on TV?

215
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:05,930
What?

216
00:14:05,931 --> 00:14:09,058
What? The wedding!

217
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:11,352
Strange you didn't tell me.

218
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:13,563
It's not so strange.

219
00:14:13,564 --> 00:14:15,607
Not so strange?

220
00:14:15,608 --> 00:14:18,526
Two great fortunes!

221
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:24,616
Like one of those great arranged
marriages of old empire Europe.

222
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:28,578
Except I'm a world citizen with
a New York pair of balls.

223
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:33,333
So how many billions together
do you two represent?

224
00:14:34,043 --> 00:14:35,752
She's a poet.

225
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:40,715
Is that what she is?

226
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,219
I thought she was a Shifrin.

227
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,553
Little of both.

228
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,647
So rich and crisp.

229
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,817
Does she let you touch
her personal parts?

230
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,322
You look gorgeous today.

231
00:15:04,323 --> 00:15:10,578
For someone who's 41 and
finally understands what her problem is.

232
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:12,038
What's that?

233
00:15:12,665 --> 00:15:14,999
Life is...

234
00:15:16,126 --> 00:15:18,503
too contemporary.

235
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:22,549
So how old is your consort?

236
00:15:26,262 --> 00:15:28,429
Nevermind, I don't wanna know.

237
00:15:30,391 --> 00:15:32,267
You'd tell me to shut up.

238
00:15:32,268 --> 00:15:34,352
Oh, one more question.

239
00:15:34,854 --> 00:15:36,771
Is she good in bed?

240
00:15:39,066 --> 00:15:41,609
Is she good in the limo?

241
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,152
I don't know yet.

242
00:15:43,153 --> 00:15:46,948
Aww, that's the trouble
will old money.

243
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:49,826
Now tell me to shut up.

244
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:54,539
I know something you wanna know.

245
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:57,083
What's that?

246
00:15:57,084 --> 00:16:01,629
There's a Rothko in private
hands that I have the privileged knowledge of.

247
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,715
It's about to become available.

248
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:05,800
You've seen it?

249
00:16:07,261 --> 00:16:10,138
Three, four years ago, yes.

250
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,223
It is...

251
00:16:13,726 --> 00:16:16,311
luminous.

252
00:16:16,312 --> 00:16:18,188
What about the chapel?

253
00:16:18,397 --> 00:16:19,898
What about it?

254
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:21,733
I've been thinking about the chapel.

255
00:16:21,734 --> 00:16:23,568
You can't buy the god-damn chapel.

256
00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:24,611
How do you know?

257
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:26,487
Contact the principals.

258
00:16:26,488 --> 00:16:29,991
I thought you'd be thrilled
about the painting. One painting.

259
00:16:29,992 --> 00:16:34,913
You don't have a important Rothko
and you've always want one, we've talked about this!

260
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:36,998
How many paintings in this chapel?

261
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:40,919
I don't know.

262
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:43,004
14? 15?

263
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:46,799
If they're selling the chapel,
I'll keep it intact.

264
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Tell them!

265
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:51,596
Keep it intact? Where?

266
00:16:51,597 --> 00:16:53,681
Tell them!

267
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:59,354
In my apartment there's
sufficient space.

268
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,065
I can make more space.

269
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:03,691
The people need to see it.

270
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:05,068
Let them buy it.

271
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:07,153
Let them outbid me.

272
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:13,701
Forgive the pissed way to say this,
but the? chapel belongs to the world.

273
00:17:13,702 --> 00:17:15,787
It's mine if I buy it.

274
00:17:17,373 --> 00:17:18,706
How much do they want for it?

275
00:17:18,707 --> 00:17:22,168
They don't wanna sell the chapel

276
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:30,802
and I don't wanna give you lessons in self-denial and social
responsibility because I don't believe for a second you're as cruel as you sound.

277
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:33,555
How much?

278
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:42,814
What does it mean to spend money?

279
00:17:43,732 --> 00:17:44,899
A dollar?

280
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,985
A million?

281
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:48,194
For a painting?

282
00:17:48,195 --> 00:17:50,280
For anything.

283
00:17:52,241 --> 00:17:54,784
I have two private
elevators now.

284
00:17:55,327 --> 00:17:58,496
One is programmed to play
Satie piano pieces.

285
00:17:58,497 --> 00:18:00,582
And move at one-quarter the normal speed.

286
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:05,170
This is right the Satie and this is the
elevator I take when I'm in a certain...

287
00:18:05,671 --> 00:18:07,005
let's say...

288
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:09,132
unsettled mood.

289
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:11,509
It calms me, makes me whole.

290
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:13,803
Who's the other elevator?

291
00:18:13,804 --> 00:18:15,013
Brother Fez.

292
00:18:15,014 --> 00:18:16,014
Who's that?

293
00:18:16,015 --> 00:18:18,099
The Sufi rap star.
You don't know this?

294
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,185
I miss things.

295
00:18:20,686 --> 00:18:22,812
I don't know what
money is anymore.

296
00:18:23,898 --> 00:18:25,607
I'm losing money
by the ton today.

297
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:27,442
Many millions.

298
00:18:27,443 --> 00:18:29,110
Betting against the yuan.

299
00:18:29,111 --> 00:18:30,528
Isn't the yuan asleep?

300
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:32,614
Currency markets never close.

301
00:18:32,615 --> 00:18:37,243
Shanghai runs day and night,
all the major exchanges, seven days a week.

302
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,703
I miss that.

303
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:43,416
I?

304
00:18:48,714 --> 00:18:50,548
How many millions?

305
00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:53,676
Hundreds of millions.

306
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:56,638
How old are you?

307
00:18:58,224 --> 00:18:59,265
28?

308
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:01,351
28.

309
00:19:02,978 --> 00:19:05,396
I want you to go to the chapel
and make them an offer.

310
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:07,899
Whatever it takes.

311
00:19:08,651 --> 00:19:10,193
I want everything that's there.

312
00:19:10,194 --> 00:19:12,278
Walls and all.

313
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:16,908
I remember what you told me once.

314
00:19:17,284 --> 00:19:18,076
What's that?

315
00:19:19,745 --> 00:19:21,830
Talent is more
erotic when it's wasted.

316
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:24,457
What did I mean?

317
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:31,130
A word?

318
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:32,382
Yeah.

319
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:35,260
Complex recommends extra security.

320
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:37,404
- You're not happy about this.
- No.

321
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:38,596
First, a threat
at the president.

322
00:19:38,597 --> 00:19:40,682
You're confident you can
handle whatever it comes up?

323
00:19:40,683 --> 00:19:43,935
Now an attack on the managing
director of the International Monetary Fund.

324
00:19:45,062 --> 00:19:45,895
Arthur Rapp?

325
00:19:45,896 --> 00:19:47,939
Arthur Rapp, yes.

326
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,582
Where?

327
00:19:48,732 --> 00:19:51,693
Nike, North Korea, while being
interviewed on television.

328
00:19:52,486 --> 00:19:54,195
It's on all the channels.

329
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:58,032
Director Rapp, will this
change your policy on the yuan?

330
00:19:58,284 --> 00:20:02,162
The yuan is uncharacteristically
inflated, which makes it unstable

331
00:20:02,163 --> 00:20:05,123
and eventually it will drop,
and when it...

332
00:20:16,218 --> 00:20:17,302
The Complex...

333
00:20:20,097 --> 00:20:22,182
accept their recommendation.

334
00:20:22,183 --> 00:20:24,267
Good.

335
00:20:46,373 --> 00:20:50,793
All these limos, my God,
that you can't tell one from another.

336
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,004
We could be kids on prom night.

337
00:20:53,506 --> 00:20:55,840
Or some dumb wedding wherever.

338
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,551
What's the charm of identical?

339
00:20:58,636 --> 00:21:03,681
That I'm a powerful person that
chooses not to demarcate his territory with

340
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:06,142
singular driblets of piss, is what?

341
00:21:06,143 --> 00:21:08,228
Something I need to apologize for?

342
00:21:08,229 --> 00:21:10,980
I want to go home and
tongue-kiss my Maxima.

343
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:13,358
You now what today is?

344
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,484
Incidentally...

345
00:21:14,485 --> 00:21:16,861
- I know.
- It's my day off, dammit!

346
00:21:16,862 --> 00:21:17,654
I know this.

347
00:21:17,655 --> 00:21:19,697
I need this extra day, desperately.

348
00:21:19,698 --> 00:21:20,406
I know this.

349
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:21,616
But you don't know this.

350
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:25,870
You can't know what it's like,
I am a single struggling mother.

351
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:27,872
We have a situation here.

352
00:21:27,873 --> 00:21:33,044
I am a mother running in the
park when my phone explodes in my navel

353
00:21:33,045 --> 00:21:37,590
I think it's the kid's nanny who
never calls unless the kid's fever reaches 105.

354
00:21:37,591 --> 00:21:39,676
But it's the situation, it...

355
00:21:39,677 --> 00:21:44,472
we have a situation alright,
we have a yuan carry that can crush us in hours.

356
00:21:44,974 --> 00:21:47,475
Take some water.
Sit on the banquette.

357
00:21:48,352 --> 00:21:50,186
I like face to face.

358
00:21:50,813 --> 00:21:53,815
And I don't need to look at all
those screens, I know what's happening.

359
00:21:53,816 --> 00:21:55,316
The yuan will fall.

360
00:21:55,317 --> 00:21:56,734
That's right.

361
00:21:56,735 --> 00:21:58,570
Consumer's spending down.

362
00:21:58,571 --> 00:21:59,904
That's right.

363
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:03,491
Besides, the Bank of China
left the interest rates unchanged.

364
00:22:04,493 --> 00:22:05,910
This happened today?

365
00:22:06,036 --> 00:22:10,039
This happened tonight in Shanghai,
I called the source at Shenzhen.

366
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,874
While running?

367
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:14,794
While flinging my body down
Maddison Avenue, to get here on time.

368
00:22:15,671 --> 00:22:17,547
The yuan can't go any higher.

369
00:22:17,548 --> 00:22:21,009
That's true, that's right.
Except it just did.

370
00:22:24,597 --> 00:22:26,139
Hadn't sleep last night.

371
00:22:45,242 --> 00:22:46,201
There's a time limit.

372
00:22:47,244 --> 00:22:47,952
Doctor Ingram?

373
00:22:47,953 --> 00:22:48,912
Who the fuck are you?

374
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:50,997
Doctor Ingram.

375
00:22:50,998 --> 00:22:52,415
Where's Doctor Nevius?

376
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,501
Called away suddenly.
A personal matter.

377
00:22:54,502 --> 00:22:57,045
Speak slowly and clearly.

378
00:22:57,713 --> 00:23:01,508
Called away suddenly,
I don' know, a family crisis...

379
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:04,552
I'm the associate, I... I...

380
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:07,138
flushed out your ear holes once.

381
00:23:11,101 --> 00:23:12,685
You do this why?

382
00:23:12,686 --> 00:23:14,145
What?

383
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,231
Everyday.

384
00:23:16,232 --> 00:23:18,066
No matter...?

385
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:20,151
Wherever I am, that's right.

386
00:23:20,528 --> 00:23:21,402
No matter.

387
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:38,169
So you do what?
Same routine every day?

388
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,504
Varies.

389
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:40,922
Depending.

390
00:23:40,923 --> 00:23:43,007
So he comes to your house

391
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:45,093
Nice!

392
00:23:45,094 --> 00:23:46,094
On weekends.

393
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:49,764
We die, Jane, on weekends. People.

394
00:23:49,765 --> 00:23:51,057
It happens.

395
00:23:51,684 --> 00:23:52,809
You're right.

396
00:23:53,435 --> 00:23:55,186
I didn't think of that.

397
00:23:55,187 --> 00:23:57,272
We die because it's the weekend.

398
00:23:58,399 --> 00:24:02,151
I thought we were moving,
but we're not anymore.

399
00:24:02,695 --> 00:24:04,362
The president's in town.

400
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:05,446
You're right.

401
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:08,158
I forgot. I though I've
seen him when I ran out of the park.

402
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:12,370
There's an entourage of limousines
going down 5th with a motorcycle escort.

403
00:24:12,371 --> 00:24:17,375
I thought all these limos are for the president,
I can understand, but it was for somebody famous's funeral.

404
00:24:19,128 --> 00:24:20,628
We die everyday.

405
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:32,307
What do we do about this?

406
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,603
Let it express itself.

407
00:24:36,604 --> 00:24:38,688
What? Do nothing?

408
00:24:38,689 --> 00:24:40,773
Let it express itself.

409
00:24:42,818 --> 00:24:44,444
You can stand up now.

410
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:50,575
So, look, we have two rumors
working on our favor.

411
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:53,369
First, there's the bankruptcies
for six straight months.

412
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,455
More each month, more on the way.

413
00:24:55,456 --> 00:24:57,540
Large Chinese corporations.

414
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:58,416
This is good.

415
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:00,084
The yuan will drop.

416
00:25:00,085 --> 00:25:02,795
This is loss of faith.
It will force the yuan to drop.

417
00:25:02,796 --> 00:25:04,255
Dollar will settle up.

418
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,883
The yuan will drop. Where's Chin?

419
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:09,135
Working on visual patterns.

420
00:25:09,386 --> 00:25:11,221
This thing doesn't chart.

421
00:25:11,222 --> 00:25:12,096
It charts.

422
00:25:12,097 --> 00:25:14,933
It doesn't chart the way
you chart technology stocks

423
00:25:14,934 --> 00:25:20,313
you can find real patterns there,
locate predicting components, this is different.

424
00:25:21,315 --> 00:25:23,650
We're teaching him to see.

425
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,737
You should do the seeing,
you're the seer.

426
00:25:28,447 --> 00:25:32,534
What is he? He's a kid.
He's got a streak in his hair, he's got the earing...

427
00:25:32,535 --> 00:25:34,202
He doesn't have the earing.

428
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,413
If he was any dreamy,
we'd have to put him on life support.

429
00:25:38,415 --> 00:25:39,874
What's the second rumor?

430
00:25:40,501 --> 00:25:43,878
There's a rumor, it seems,
involving the Finance minister

431
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:47,048
some kind of scandal
about a misconstrued comment

432
00:25:47,132 --> 00:25:51,302
He made a comment about the economy
that may have been misconstrued.

433
00:25:51,554 --> 00:25:56,266
The whole country is now analyzing
the grammar and syntax of this comment.

434
00:25:57,142 --> 00:26:00,186
Or it wasn't even what he said,
it was when he paused.

435
00:26:00,688 --> 00:26:03,356
They're trying to construe
the meaning of the pause.

436
00:26:04,984 --> 00:26:08,152
It may be deeper
even than grammar.

437
00:26:08,821 --> 00:26:10,405
He may be breathing.

438
00:26:11,282 --> 00:26:15,118
So the whole economy convulses
because the man took a breath.

439
00:26:19,206 --> 00:26:21,124
You gripped the water bottle.

440
00:26:22,793 --> 00:26:25,003
Yes, it's that soft type plastic.

441
00:26:25,004 --> 00:26:26,504
You grip it.

442
00:26:27,047 --> 00:26:28,590
You choke it.

443
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,676
It's a matter of fact thing.

444
00:26:32,344 --> 00:26:33,845
It's sexual tension.

445
00:26:33,846 --> 00:26:35,597
It's every day
nervousness in a life.

446
00:26:35,598 --> 00:26:37,682
It's sexual tension.

447
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:40,268
Days like these...

448
00:26:46,066 --> 00:26:47,108
What?

449
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:53,531
That whole sad business of
Judeo-Christian jogging. You were not born to run.

450
00:26:53,532 --> 00:26:55,283
I look at you. I know what you are.

451
00:26:55,284 --> 00:26:57,744
Your sloppy body, smelly and wet

452
00:26:57,745 --> 00:27:03,124
a woman who was born to stay strapped in a
chair, while a man tells her how much she excites him.

453
00:27:04,126 --> 00:27:07,045
How come we've never
spend this kind of time together?

454
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,389
Your prostate is asymmetrical.

455
00:27:57,096 --> 00:27:59,681
Those two, they're ours?

456
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:03,142
I felt the need

457
00:28:04,436 --> 00:28:06,312
imperative, that we reroute.

458
00:28:06,522 --> 00:28:08,022
The situation is what?

459
00:28:08,023 --> 00:28:08,982
This.

460
00:28:08,983 --> 00:28:13,903
Water main break, we have flood
conditions ahead. State of chaos.

461
00:28:14,154 --> 00:28:18,992
This. The question of the president
and his whereabouts. He is fluid. He is moving.

462
00:28:18,993 --> 00:28:24,122
Wherever he goes, our satellite receiver reports
a ripple effect in the traffic that causes mass paralysis.

463
00:28:24,123 --> 00:28:25,415
This also.

464
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:29,961
There's a funeral proceeding slowly
downtown and now deflecting westward.

465
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:33,673
Many vehicles, numerous mourners on foot.
And finally this.

466
00:28:33,924 --> 00:28:36,634
We have a report of imminent
activity in the area.

467
00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:38,636
Activity?

468
00:28:38,637 --> 00:28:39,679
Imminent.

469
00:28:40,222 --> 00:28:42,515
Nature is yet unknown.

470
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,643
Complex says "use caution".

471
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:32,273
Recite to me.

472
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,028
Where's your necktie?

473
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:39,113
I had my checkout.

474
00:29:39,114 --> 00:29:41,199
Saw my heart on the screen.

475
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,329
I don't like saying this.

476
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,414
But?

477
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:50,959
You smell of sex.

478
00:29:51,293 --> 00:29:53,378
That's my doctor's
appointment you smell.

479
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:55,463
I smell sex all over you.

480
00:29:55,714 --> 00:29:57,549
It's what?

481
00:29:59,552 --> 00:30:01,177
It's hungry you smell.

482
00:30:02,012 --> 00:30:03,888
I wanna eat lunch.

483
00:30:04,306 --> 00:30:06,182
You wanna eat lunch.

484
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:08,726
We're people in the world.

485
00:30:09,562 --> 00:30:11,396
We need to eat and talk.

486
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,236
I'm not sure how hungry I am.

487
00:30:18,237 --> 00:30:20,321
Eat. You'll find out.

488
00:30:21,365 --> 00:30:23,116
Speaking of sex.

489
00:30:23,117 --> 00:30:27,245
We've been married only weeks.
Barely weeks.

490
00:30:27,246 --> 00:30:30,957
Everything is barely weeks.
We have minutes to live.

491
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:36,754
We don't want to start counting the times, do we?
And having solemn discussions on the subject.

492
00:30:36,755 --> 00:30:38,423
No, we wanna do it.

493
00:30:38,424 --> 00:30:42,260
And we will.
We shall.

494
00:30:42,761 --> 00:30:44,345
We wanna have it.

495
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,098
Sex.

496
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:49,184
Yes.

497
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:52,061
Because there isn'time
not to have it.

498
00:30:52,062 --> 00:30:57,275
Time is a thing that grows scarcer every day.
What, you don't know this?

499
00:30:57,276 --> 00:31:00,778
I like that bookshop.
Do you know why?

500
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:03,948
Because it's semi-underground.

501
00:31:03,991 --> 00:31:07,535
You feel hidden.
You like to hide.

502
00:31:07,828 --> 00:31:09,621
From what?

503
00:31:09,622 --> 00:31:11,706
Sometimes only noise.

504
00:31:12,917 --> 00:31:18,213
You're one of those silent
wistful children, glued to the shadows.

505
00:31:18,464 --> 00:31:19,964
And you?

506
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:22,050
I don't know.
I don't think about it.

507
00:31:22,635 --> 00:31:25,595
Think about one thing
and tell me what it was.

508
00:31:26,138 --> 00:31:28,306
Alright, one thing.

509
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:33,853
When I was four, I figured out how
much I weight on each of the planets in the Solar System.

510
00:31:34,063 --> 00:31:38,608
That's nice.
I like that.

511
00:31:39,235 --> 00:31:42,946
Such science and ego combined.

512
00:31:44,323 --> 00:31:46,366
When are we going to the lake?

513
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:47,909
Fuck the lake.

514
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:52,580
I thought we like it there after
all the planning, the construction.

515
00:31:52,623 --> 00:31:56,417
To get away, to be alone together.
It's quiet at the lake.

516
00:31:56,418 --> 00:31:58,086
It's quiet in town.

517
00:31:59,213 --> 00:32:05,176
The way we live, yes, I suppose.
High enough, far enough.

518
00:32:05,886 --> 00:32:07,637
What about your car?

519
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:09,722
Not so quiet, surely.

520
00:32:09,932 --> 00:32:12,016
You spend a lot of time there.

521
00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:14,102
I had the car prousted.

522
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,771
Yes?

523
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,567
The way they build a stretch is this:

524
00:32:20,568 --> 00:32:25,530
Take a vehicle base unit cut in half
with a huge throbbing saw device.

525
00:32:25,739 --> 00:32:30,285
And they add a segment to lengthen
the chassis by ten, elven, twelve feet.

526
00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:33,872
Whatever desired dimension.
Twenty-two feet, if you like.

527
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:38,042
While they did this to my car,
I sent the word that they had to proust is.

528
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:40,753
Cork-line it against street noise.

529
00:32:41,213 --> 00:32:43,965
It's lovely, actually.
I love that.

530
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:49,596
The vehicles are armored, of course.
This complicated the cork-lining.

531
00:32:49,805 --> 00:32:52,140
But they managed in the end.

532
00:32:53,475 --> 00:32:57,270
It's a gesture.
A thing a man does.

533
00:32:57,313 --> 00:32:58,646
Did it work?

534
00:32:58,647 --> 00:33:00,440
How could it work, no!

535
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:04,819
This city eats and sleeps noise.
Makes noise out of every century.

536
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:09,908
Makes the same noises that were made in the seventeen century,
along with other noises that where developed since then.

537
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:11,075
No.

538
00:33:11,494 --> 00:33:15,955
But I don't mind the noise.
The noise energizes me.

539
00:33:16,707 --> 00:33:19,334
Important thing is that it's there.

540
00:33:19,335 --> 00:33:20,960
Cork?

541
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:23,046
That's right. The cork.

542
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:27,258
This is what finally matters.

543
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,100
Is this what I wanted?

544
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,603
Tell me what you wanted.

545
00:33:38,604 --> 00:33:41,564
Duck consommé
with an herb twist.

546
00:33:43,484 --> 00:33:48,154
It's true, you know.
You do actually reek of sexual discharge.

547
00:33:50,783 --> 00:33:56,246
It's not the sex you think I've had.
It's the sex I want, that's what you smell on me.

548
00:33:56,539 --> 00:33:59,457
'Cause the more I look at you,
the more I know about us both.

549
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:01,543
Tell me what that means.

550
00:34:01,877 --> 00:34:04,462
Or don't.
No, don't.

551
00:34:04,505 --> 00:34:06,548
And the more I wanna
have sex with you.

552
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:09,884
Because that's a certain kind of sex
that has an element of cleansing.

553
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:14,097
It's the antidote to disillusion.
The counter-poison.

554
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:21,145
You need to be inflamed, don't you?
This is your element.

555
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:24,983
Where are you going after the bookstore?
Because there's a hotel.

556
00:34:24,984 --> 00:34:27,068
I was going to the bookstore. Period.

557
00:34:27,361 --> 00:34:30,738
I was in the bookstore,
I was happy there.

558
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,616
Where were you going?

559
00:34:33,617 --> 00:34:35,702
To get a haircut.

560
00:34:37,246 --> 00:34:38,663
Do you need a haircut?

561
00:34:38,664 --> 00:34:40,748
I need anything you can give me.

562
00:34:40,749 --> 00:34:42,584
Be nice.

563
00:34:43,794 --> 00:34:46,921
I need all the meanings
of the inflamed.

564
00:34:47,256 --> 00:34:50,592
There's a hotel just across the avenue.
We can start over.

565
00:34:50,593 --> 00:34:53,386
Or finish with intense feeling,
that's one of the meanings.

566
00:34:53,387 --> 00:34:57,515
To arouse a passionate feeling.
We can finish what we barely started.

567
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:00,476
Two hotels, in fact.
We have a choice.

568
00:35:01,145 --> 00:35:03,188
I don't think I want to pursue this.

569
00:35:03,981 --> 00:35:06,024
No, you don't.
You wouldn't.

570
00:35:08,277 --> 00:35:10,111
Be nice to me.

571
00:35:18,954 --> 00:35:21,664
A specter is haunting the world!
A specter is haunting the world!

572
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:26,878
A specter is haunting the world!

573
00:35:39,475 --> 00:35:44,687
We want to think about the art of money-making.
The greeks have a word for it.

574
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:49,734
Chrimatistikos.
But we have to give the word a little leeway.

575
00:35:49,735 --> 00:35:54,656
Adapt it to the current situation.
Because money has taken a turn.

576
00:35:55,074 --> 00:36:00,578
All wealth has become wealth for its own sake.
There's no other kind of enormous wealth.

577
00:36:00,871 --> 00:36:05,834
Money has lost its narrative quality,
the way painting did once upon a time.

578
00:36:05,835 --> 00:36:08,586
Money is talking to itself.

579
00:36:09,171 --> 00:36:13,967
I want this car, which I love.
The glow of the screens.

580
00:36:14,009 --> 00:36:15,718
I love the screens.

581
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:19,597
The glow of cyber-capital.
So radiant and seductive.

582
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:21,933
I understand none of this.

583
00:36:22,226 --> 00:36:26,229
Does it ever stop? Does it slow down?

584
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,814
Of course not.

585
00:36:28,065 --> 00:36:31,109
Why should it?
It's fantastic.

586
00:36:31,735 --> 00:36:36,447
But you know how shameless I am in
the presence of anything that calls itself an idea.

587
00:36:36,615 --> 00:36:41,119
The idea is time.
Living in the future.

588
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:45,665
Look at those numbers running.
Money makes time.

589
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:50,628
It used to be the other way around.
Clock time accelerated the rise of the capitalism.

590
00:36:50,629 --> 00:36:54,716
People stopped thinking about eternity
and began to concentrate on hours.

591
00:36:54,717 --> 00:36:59,137
Measurable hours, man hours,
using labor more efficiently.

592
00:36:59,138 --> 00:37:01,222
It's cyber-capital
that created the future.

593
00:37:02,224 --> 00:37:05,143
What is the measurement
called a nanosecond?

594
00:37:05,394 --> 00:37:07,145
Ten to the minus nine power.

595
00:37:07,146 --> 00:37:09,689
- What?
- One billionth of a second.

596
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:11,232
I understand none of it.

597
00:37:11,233 --> 00:37:16,196
But it tells me how rigorous we need to be in order
to take adequate measure of the world around us.

598
00:37:16,197 --> 00:37:17,822
There are zeptoseconds.

599
00:37:17,823 --> 00:37:19,491
Good, I'm glad.

600
00:37:19,492 --> 00:37:22,785
Yoctoseconds.
One septilionth of a second.

601
00:37:23,162 --> 00:37:28,875
Because time is a corporate asset now.
It belongs to the free market system.

602
00:37:28,876 --> 00:37:30,960
The present is harder to find.

603
00:37:30,961 --> 00:37:36,925
It is being sucked out of the world to make way
for the future of uncontrolled markets and huge investment potentials.

604
00:37:37,676 --> 00:37:40,136
The future becomes insistent.

605
00:37:41,347 --> 00:37:45,099
This is why something will happen soon.
Maybe today.

606
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:50,355
To correct the acceleration of time
and bring nature back to normal, more or less.

607
00:38:30,145 --> 00:38:32,564
You have to understand.

608
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:36,943
The more visionary the idea,
the more people it leaves behind.

609
00:38:36,944 --> 00:38:39,612
This is what the protest is all about.

610
00:38:39,613 --> 00:38:46,911
Visions of technology and wealth, the force of the cyber-capital
that will send people to the gutter to retch and die.

611
00:38:46,912 --> 00:38:49,455
What is the flaw of
human rationality?

612
00:38:50,499 --> 00:38:51,541
What?

613
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:55,962
It pretends not to see the horror and death
at the end of the scheme it builds.

614
00:38:55,963 --> 00:38:58,423
This is a protest against the future.

615
00:38:58,424 --> 00:39:03,511
They want to hold off the future. They want
to normalize it, keep it from overwhelming the present.

616
00:39:03,512 --> 00:39:08,349
The future is always a wholeness,
a sameness, we're all tall and happy there.

617
00:39:08,392 --> 00:39:14,022
This is why the future fails.
It can never be the cruel happy place we want to make it.

618
00:39:14,023 --> 00:39:18,026
What would happen if they'd knew
the head of Packer Capital was in the car?

619
00:39:18,027 --> 00:39:20,820
We know what the anarchist have always said.

620
00:39:20,821 --> 00:39:21,946
Yes.

621
00:39:21,947 --> 00:39:23,072
Tell me.

622
00:39:23,073 --> 00:39:26,659
The urge to destroy
is a creative thing.

623
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:31,873
This is also a hallmark of capitalist thought.
Enforced destruction.

624
00:39:31,874 --> 00:39:37,629
Old industries have to be harshly eliminated.
New markets have to be forcibly claimed

625
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,924
and old markets have to be re-exploited.

626
00:39:40,925 --> 00:39:44,928
Destroy the past. Make the future.

627
00:39:53,145 --> 00:39:58,608
This is the thing about genius.
Genius alters the terms of its habitat.

628
00:39:58,609 --> 00:40:03,863
Technology is crucial the civilization, why?
Because it helps us to make our fate.

629
00:40:03,864 --> 00:40:07,992
We don't need God, or miracles
or flight of the bumblebee

630
00:40:07,993 --> 00:40:12,914
but it is also crouched and undecidable
It can go either way.

631
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:18,920
You've been talking about the
future being impatient, pressing upon us.

632
00:40:18,921 --> 00:40:24,425
That was theory. I am your
chief of theory, I deal in theory.

633
00:40:52,538 --> 00:40:54,622
It's not original.

634
00:40:57,126 --> 00:40:58,918
What's original?

635
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,004
He did it, didn't he?

636
00:41:01,005 --> 00:41:03,089
It's an inappropriation.

637
00:41:04,717 --> 00:41:07,635
He poured the gasoline
and lit the match.

638
00:41:08,095 --> 00:41:14,642
All those Vietnamese monks
one after another in all their lotus positions.

639
00:41:16,437 --> 00:41:18,396
Imagine the pain.

640
00:41:19,064 --> 00:41:20,815
Sit there, feel it.

641
00:41:20,816 --> 00:41:23,860
Immolating themselves endlessly.

642
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,946
To say something.

643
00:41:28,407 --> 00:41:30,867
To make people think.

644
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:33,411
It's not original.

645
00:41:42,379 --> 00:41:43,338
Just now.

646
00:41:43,339 --> 00:41:44,172
What?

647
00:41:44,465 --> 00:41:47,300
A report from the Complex,
concerns of your safety.

648
00:41:48,093 --> 00:41:49,302
A little late, aren't they?

649
00:41:49,303 --> 00:41:51,638
This is specific and catergorical.

650
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:52,680
There's been a threat, then.

651
00:41:52,681 --> 00:41:56,476
Assessment, credible red.
Highest order of urgency.

652
00:41:56,644 --> 00:41:59,354
An incursion is
already in progress.

653
00:41:59,355 --> 00:42:00,855
Now we know.

654
00:42:00,856 --> 00:42:02,941
Now we have to act
now on what we know.

655
00:42:03,818 --> 00:42:06,194
But we still want
what we want.

656
00:42:07,196 --> 00:42:08,530
We want a haircut.

657
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:15,620
It's interesting,
isn't it?

658
00:42:17,164 --> 00:42:19,457
About men and immortality.

659
00:42:20,626 --> 00:42:25,755
You live in a tower that soars to heaven
and goes unpunished by God.

660
00:42:26,298 --> 00:42:28,341
And you bought an airplane.

661
00:42:29,343 --> 00:42:31,135
I've nearly forgotten this.

662
00:42:31,637 --> 00:42:33,972
Soviet or ex-soviet.

663
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:39,185
A strategic bomber, capable
of knocking out a small city.

664
00:42:39,603 --> 00:42:41,104
Is this right?

665
00:42:41,689 --> 00:42:46,568
It's an old Tu-160.
NATO calls it Blackjack A.

666
00:42:46,819 --> 00:42:52,031
It was deployed around 1988,
carries nuclear bombs and cruise missiles.

667
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:54,117
This were not included in the deal.

668
00:42:55,703 --> 00:42:58,997
And they wouldn't let you fly it.
Could you fly it?

669
00:42:59,665 --> 00:43:01,332
Could and did.

670
00:43:02,251 --> 00:43:04,294
They wouldn't let me fly it armed.

671
00:43:04,295 --> 00:43:05,587
Who didn't?

672
00:43:05,588 --> 00:43:07,422
State Department.

673
00:43:08,007 --> 00:43:12,427
The Pentagon, The Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.

674
00:43:12,428 --> 00:43:13,970
The Russians?

675
00:43:13,971 --> 00:43:19,934
What Russians? I've bought it black market and dirt cheap
from a Belgian arms dealer in Kazakhstan.

676
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:24,147
That's where I took the controls,
for half hour, over the desert.

677
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:26,232
US Dollars, 31 million.

678
00:43:27,026 --> 00:43:28,610
Where is it now?

679
00:43:28,611 --> 00:43:34,616
Parked in a storage facility in Arizona,
waiting for replacement parts that nobody can find.

680
00:43:35,201 --> 00:43:36,701
Sitting in the wind.

681
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:40,205
I go out there now and then.

682
00:43:40,206 --> 00:43:42,290
To do what?

683
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:44,542
To look at it.

684
00:43:45,377 --> 00:43:46,961
It's mine.

685
00:43:51,175 --> 00:43:53,301
People will not die.

686
00:43:53,844 --> 00:43:56,846
Isn't this the creed
of a new culture?

687
00:43:58,224 --> 00:44:02,268
People will be absorbed
in streams of information.

688
00:44:02,686 --> 00:44:04,354
I know nothing
about that.

689
00:44:05,648 --> 00:44:07,774
Computers will die.

690
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:11,402
They're dying in
their present form.

691
00:44:12,071 --> 00:44:14,989
They're just about dead
as distinct units.

692
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:20,829
A box, a screen,
a keyboard...

693
00:44:21,497 --> 00:44:24,666
they're melting into
texture of every day life.

694
00:44:25,584 --> 00:44:27,252
Is this true or not?

695
00:44:27,253 --> 00:44:29,170
Even the word "computer".

696
00:44:29,171 --> 00:44:32,715
Even the word "computer"
sounds backward and dumb.

697
00:44:55,239 --> 00:44:57,115
You work out?

698
00:44:57,283 --> 00:44:58,825
Six percent body fat.

699
00:44:58,826 --> 00:45:01,578
Used to be my number.
Then I got lazy.

700
00:45:04,874 --> 00:45:06,708
What are you gonna do about it?

701
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:11,671
Hit the machines in the morning and
run in the park at night.

702
00:45:14,967 --> 00:45:16,801
Where is he now?

703
00:45:17,261 --> 00:45:18,469
Who?

704
00:45:20,472 --> 00:45:23,600
You know.

705
00:45:23,601 --> 00:45:26,269
He's in the lobby. Torval.

706
00:45:26,896 --> 00:45:29,397
He's watching them
come and go.

707
00:45:30,024 --> 00:45:34,027
Danko's in the
hall outside.

708
00:45:34,028 --> 00:45:36,112
Who's that?

709
00:45:36,113 --> 00:45:38,198
Danko, my partner.

710
00:45:41,744 --> 00:45:43,661
He's new.

711
00:45:43,662 --> 00:45:47,999
I'm new. He's been watching
your back for sometime now.

712
00:45:48,792 --> 00:45:52,170
? after these wars in the Balkans.
He's a veteran.

713
00:45:55,925 --> 00:45:58,551
What's he gonna
say to you about this?

714
00:46:00,095 --> 00:46:03,765
Torval.
That's who you're talking about?

715
00:46:05,017 --> 00:46:06,768
Say his name.

716
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:08,853
What's he gonna say to you?

717
00:46:09,188 --> 00:46:13,775
Just so you're safe.
That's the job.

718
00:46:16,862 --> 00:46:20,657
Men get possessive.
What, you don't know this?

719
00:46:20,658 --> 00:46:22,742
I heard the rumor.

720
00:46:23,118 --> 00:46:27,163
Fact is, I technically speaking
went off-duty an hour ago, so...

721
00:46:28,123 --> 00:46:31,668
Basically, my time
we're dealing with here.

722
00:46:54,733 --> 00:46:56,734
Do you find this interesting?

723
00:46:56,735 --> 00:46:58,069
What?

724
00:46:59,155 --> 00:47:01,739
Protecting someone in danger.

725
00:47:02,783 --> 00:47:06,244
What makes you willing to do this?
Take this risk.

726
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,037
Maybe you're worth it.

727
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:14,836
Maybe it's just the pay.
It's pretty good.

728
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:19,174
The risk?

729
00:47:20,176 --> 00:47:21,926
I don't think about the risk.

730
00:47:22,344 --> 00:47:26,306
You're the man in the crosshairs,
I figure the risk is yours.

731
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,601
But is it interesting?

732
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:33,855
It's interesting to be near
men somebody wants to kill.

733
00:47:38,068 --> 00:47:40,778
You know what they say,
don't you?

734
00:47:43,282 --> 00:47:46,910
The logical extension
of business is murder.

735
00:47:48,496 --> 00:47:50,413
Move little left.

736
00:47:50,789 --> 00:47:53,124
Move little left.

737
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:00,882
Nice.
Perfect.

738
00:48:02,843 --> 00:48:05,094
What kind of weapon
did he give you?

739
00:48:06,555 --> 00:48:07,889
Tazer.

740
00:48:20,736 --> 00:48:23,530
He doesn't trust me
yet with deadly force.

741
00:48:28,911 --> 00:48:30,954
How many volts at your disposal?

742
00:48:31,539 --> 00:48:33,039
Hundred thousand.

743
00:48:33,582 --> 00:48:35,542
Jams your nervous system.

744
00:48:36,585 --> 00:48:40,338
Drop you to your knees.
Like this.

745
00:48:47,012 --> 00:48:48,096
Stun me.

746
00:48:49,598 --> 00:48:54,853
I mean it. I want you to do it,
Kendra, show how it feels like.

747
00:48:55,563 --> 00:48:57,564
I'm looking for more.

748
00:48:58,607 --> 00:49:00,692
Show me something
I don't know.

749
00:49:01,443 --> 00:49:05,780
Stun me to my DNA. Come on, do it!
Click the switch!

750
00:49:05,781 --> 00:49:09,409
Aim and fire.
I want all the voltage the weapon holds.

751
00:49:09,785 --> 00:49:12,954
Do it!
Shoot it!

752
00:49:14,456 --> 00:49:15,832
Now.

753
00:49:46,238 --> 00:49:48,198
I need to know
where you're going.

754
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:50,283
Wait and learn.

755
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:59,584
You smoke since when?

756
00:50:01,295 --> 00:50:03,838
I took it up when
I was fifteen.

757
00:50:04,924 --> 00:50:11,804
It's one of those things a girl takes up.
It tells her she's more than a skinny body nobody looks at.

758
00:50:12,181 --> 00:50:14,891
There's a certain
drama in her life.

759
00:50:15,768 --> 00:50:20,271
She notices herself.
Then other people notice her.

760
00:50:20,898 --> 00:50:24,692
Then she marries one of them.
Then, they go to dinner.

761
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:31,032
You're wearing a cocktail dress.

762
00:50:32,284 --> 00:50:33,451
Yes?

763
00:50:34,495 --> 00:50:36,412
It's navy blue.

764
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:38,122
Yes.

765
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:43,461
And that's your...
silver jewelery.

766
00:50:45,256 --> 00:50:46,840
Yes, it is.

767
00:50:47,508 --> 00:50:48,925
I'm noticing.

768
00:50:49,802 --> 00:50:51,010
How was the play?

769
00:50:52,388 --> 00:50:54,806
I left at intermission,
didn't I?

770
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:57,851
What was it about
and who was in it?

771
00:50:57,852 --> 00:50:59,936
I'm making conversation.

772
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:04,149
I went on impulse.

773
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:06,568
The audience was sparse.

774
00:51:06,569 --> 00:51:10,488
Five minutes after the
curtains went up, I understood why.

775
00:51:11,157 --> 00:51:13,158
Where is your jacket?

776
00:51:16,036 --> 00:51:17,745
Where's my jacket?

777
00:51:17,746 --> 00:51:19,831
You were wearing a suit jacket earlier.

778
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:23,084
Where is your jacket?

779
00:51:25,129 --> 00:51:28,756
Lost in the scuffle, I guess.
You saw the car.

780
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:30,842
We were under attack by anarchists.

781
00:51:30,843 --> 00:51:35,013
Just two hours ago, there were major
global protests. Now, what, forgotten.

782
00:51:36,432 --> 00:51:38,766
Something else I wish I could forget.

783
00:51:38,767 --> 00:51:40,852
That's my peanuts you smell.

784
00:51:42,563 --> 00:51:47,692
Didn't I see you come out the hotel up the
street while I was standing outside the theater?

785
00:51:48,777 --> 00:51:51,529
Is that the hotel
you wanted to take me to?

786
00:51:52,406 --> 00:51:53,948
We don't need a hotel.

787
00:51:54,241 --> 00:51:55,658
We'll do it in the ladies room.

788
00:51:55,826 --> 00:51:58,828
We'll go to the alley out back,
rattle a garbage can. Look...

789
00:51:58,829 --> 00:52:02,373
I'm trying to make contact
in the most ordinary ways.

790
00:52:02,374 --> 00:52:05,710
To see and hear.
To notice your mood.

791
00:52:05,711 --> 00:52:07,212
Your clothes.

792
00:52:07,213 --> 00:52:08,379
This is important.

793
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,466
Are your stocking on straight?
I understand this at some level.

794
00:52:11,467 --> 00:52:13,551
How people look...

795
00:52:13,552 --> 00:52:14,802
what people wear.

796
00:52:14,803 --> 00:52:16,888
How they smell.

797
00:52:16,889 --> 00:52:18,973
Do you mind my saying that?

798
00:52:19,975 --> 00:52:22,227
Am I being too wifely?

799
00:52:23,395 --> 00:52:25,563
I'll tell you
what the problem is.

800
00:52:26,398 --> 00:52:28,274
I don't know how
to be indifferent.

801
00:52:29,068 --> 00:52:31,194
I can't master this.

802
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:34,155
And it makes me
usceptible to pain.

803
00:52:35,783 --> 00:52:38,034
In other words, it hurts.

804
00:52:40,746 --> 00:52:42,247
This is good.

805
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:44,791
We like people talking.

806
00:52:44,792 --> 00:52:46,417
Isn't this how they talk?

807
00:52:46,418 --> 00:52:48,503
How would I know?

808
00:52:49,255 --> 00:52:51,464
My prostate is asymmetrical.

809
00:52:51,465 --> 00:52:53,550
What does that mean?

810
00:52:53,801 --> 00:52:56,010
I don't know.

811
00:52:56,929 --> 00:52:58,388
You have to see a doctor.

812
00:52:58,389 --> 00:53:00,765
I just saw a doctor.
I see a doctor every day.

813
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:02,851
You just saw a doctor.

814
00:53:03,602 --> 00:53:04,936
That's how I know.

815
00:53:10,442 --> 00:53:16,698
Packer Capital portfolio is being reduced to
near nothingness in the course of a day.

816
00:53:17,867 --> 00:53:22,996
My personal fortune in the tens of billions
is in ruinous convergence with this fact.

817
00:53:23,497 --> 00:53:26,082
And there's been a
credible threat at my life.

818
00:53:27,251 --> 00:53:28,585
It's OK.

819
00:53:28,878 --> 00:53:30,628
It's fine.

820
00:53:31,046 --> 00:53:33,798
Makes me feel free in
a way I've never known.

821
00:53:33,799 --> 00:53:37,969
That's so awful.
Don't say things like that.

822
00:53:38,762 --> 00:53:42,891
Free to do what?
Go broke and die?

823
00:53:45,728 --> 00:53:51,149
Listen to me, I'll help you financially.
I'll truly do what I can to help.

824
00:53:51,942 --> 00:53:56,321
You can reestablish yourself.
At your pace, in your way.

825
00:53:57,239 --> 00:53:59,699
Tell me what you need
and I promise I'll help.

826
00:54:00,951 --> 00:54:06,706
But as a couple, as a marriage,
I think we're done, aren't we?

827
00:54:08,292 --> 00:54:13,046
You speak of being free.
This is your lucky day.

828
00:54:31,106 --> 00:54:35,652
This is very crazy.
Take over whole theater.

829
00:54:35,861 --> 00:54:38,738
What do you think?

830
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,616
I don't know

831
00:54:41,617 --> 00:54:45,829
I don't know either.
But I think it is crazy.

832
00:54:46,622 --> 00:54:49,874
Looks like drug scene.
What do you think?

833
00:54:50,209 --> 00:54:51,960
Yes.

834
00:54:52,503 --> 00:54:58,091
I think it is latest drug.
Called novo.

835
00:54:58,092 --> 00:55:00,802
Makes pain go away.

836
00:55:01,971 --> 00:55:04,597
Look how good they feel.

837
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:08,810
Kids.

838
00:55:09,395 --> 00:55:12,438
They are kids, exactly.

839
00:55:13,816 --> 00:55:19,779
What pain do they feel that they
need to take pill? Music?

840
00:55:21,407 --> 00:55:24,784
Too loud. So what?

841
00:55:26,078 --> 00:55:28,830
It is beautiful how they dance.

842
00:55:31,292 --> 00:55:35,503
What pain do they feel
too young to buy beer?

843
00:55:36,755 --> 00:55:39,883
There's pain enough
for everybody now.

844
00:55:39,884 --> 00:55:42,886
I don't believe I'm here.

845
00:55:43,846 --> 00:55:47,557
You tell me when we leave.
I'll take you out.

846
00:55:48,517 --> 00:55:50,685
Where is he?

847
00:55:51,103 --> 00:55:56,608
At the entrance.
Torval?

848
00:55:56,609 --> 00:55:59,360
He watches the entrance.

849
00:56:02,573 --> 00:56:05,366
Do you kill people?

850
00:56:05,367 --> 00:56:08,077
What do you think?

851
00:56:11,373 --> 00:56:13,084
Like lunch.

852
00:56:17,546 --> 00:56:18,713
What do we know?

853
00:56:18,714 --> 00:56:20,798
We know it's not a coup.

854
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:25,345
It's not an organized terror cell or
international kidnappers with ransom demands.

855
00:56:25,346 --> 00:56:27,430
It's an individual.

856
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,307
Do we care?

857
00:56:29,308 --> 00:56:32,852
We don't have a name.
But we have a phone call.

858
00:56:32,937 --> 00:56:35,063
The Complex is analyzing
the voice data.

859
00:56:35,064 --> 00:56:39,567
It made certain assessments. They're projecting
a course of action on the part of the individual.

860
00:56:39,985 --> 00:56:42,487
Why can't I work up any
curiosity on the subject?

861
00:56:43,572 --> 00:56:45,573
Because it
doesn't matter.

862
00:56:45,866 --> 00:56:50,119
Whoever it is.
That's who it is.

863
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,667
Eric.

864
00:57:05,094 --> 00:57:06,469
Why we're here?

865
00:57:06,846 --> 00:57:08,555
You ain't heard?

866
00:57:08,806 --> 00:57:09,681
What?

867
00:57:09,682 --> 00:57:11,766
Brother Fez.

868
00:57:13,185 --> 00:57:14,227
What?

869
00:57:15,855 --> 00:57:17,313
Dead.

870
00:57:18,524 --> 00:57:20,984
No!
What? Can't be!

871
00:57:20,985 --> 00:57:23,945
Dead. Died. Earlier today.

872
00:57:25,447 --> 00:57:26,906
I don't know this.

873
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,535
Funeral has been
in progress all day...

874
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:34,080
The family wanted the city
to have a chance to pay respect.

875
00:57:35,124 --> 00:57:39,127
Record label wanted an
exploitation event. Big and loud.

876
00:57:39,253 --> 00:57:42,297
Street to street.
Right through the night.

877
00:57:44,216 --> 00:57:45,800
I don't know this.

878
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:50,889
How can this be? I love his music.
I have his music in my elevator.

879
00:57:52,016 --> 00:57:54,350
I know the man.
What, they've shot him?

880
00:57:54,351 --> 00:57:58,021
Fez've been having cardiac
problems for years. Since highschool.

881
00:57:58,731 --> 00:58:01,399
Been seeing specialists,
been seeing faith healers.

882
00:58:02,276 --> 00:58:04,194
The heart just wore out.

883
00:58:04,653 --> 00:58:06,696
This ain't a thug down some alley.

884
00:58:06,697 --> 00:58:10,742
The man never been breathalyzed,
barely, since he was seventeen.

885
00:58:12,286 --> 00:58:14,287
Hope you're not disappointed.

886
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:15,914
Disappointed?

887
00:58:15,915 --> 00:58:18,291
That our man here wasn't shot!

888
00:58:18,501 --> 00:58:20,376
Hope he didn't let you down.

889
00:58:20,544 --> 00:58:23,671
Natural causes,
now that's a let-down.

890
00:58:29,595 --> 00:58:31,429
What happened to your stretch?

891
00:58:31,972 --> 00:58:34,682
Let a fine machine degrade in public.

892
00:58:35,726 --> 00:58:37,435
That's scandal, man.

893
00:58:38,437 --> 00:58:40,355
Everything's a scandal.

894
00:58:40,898 --> 00:58:43,525
Dying's a scandal,
but we all do it.

895
00:58:44,026 --> 00:58:46,236
I think I'm hearing
voices in the night.

896
00:58:46,237 --> 00:58:49,572
Because I can't
believe you're saying this.

897
00:59:11,387 --> 00:59:13,555
Ask me: do I love this shit?

898
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:19,102
Me being big as I am and a retro-nigger.
I have to love what I'm seeing.

899
00:59:19,103 --> 00:59:23,231
Because this is something I can never dream
of doing in my thinnest day on Earth.

900
00:59:23,607 --> 00:59:26,234
He liked having the clergy nearby.

901
00:59:26,485 --> 00:59:31,406
He showed up in my office once with an imam
and two white boys from Utah in suits.

902
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,078
He was always excusing
himself so he could pray.

903
00:59:38,247 --> 00:59:41,457
He lived in a minaret,
for a while, in Los Angeles.

904
00:59:42,334 --> 00:59:44,335
Yeah, I heard that.

905
00:59:46,547 --> 00:59:49,257
I went to visit him once.

906
00:59:50,509 --> 00:59:52,677
He built it next
to his house.

907
00:59:53,512 --> 00:59:56,514
He moved out of his house
and into the minaret.

908
01:01:31,902 --> 01:01:34,445
I'm after you long time.

909
01:01:34,947 --> 01:01:38,533
Son of a bitch.
I glop you good.

910
01:01:40,536 --> 01:01:47,125
Today you are cremed by the master
Andre Petrescu. The pastry assassin.

911
01:01:47,543 --> 01:01:51,713
This is my mission worldwide to sabotage
power and wealth.

912
01:01:53,674 --> 01:01:58,803
For years, I'm waiting for this.
Freshly baked only, you know.

913
01:02:00,264 --> 01:02:05,018
I passed up the president of the United
States to make the strike.

914
01:02:07,563 --> 01:02:15,069
I can creme him anytime,
but you are major statement.

915
01:02:15,488 --> 01:02:17,864
Very hard to zero in.

916
01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:39,427
You lack of humor, Mr. Packer.

917
01:02:39,428 --> 01:02:46,267
You live up your reputation, okay, but I've been kicked and
beaten by the security so many times I'm walking dead.

918
01:02:46,268 --> 01:02:50,522
You know they put me a radio collar
when I was in England, to save the Queen.

919
01:02:50,523 --> 01:02:52,607
They tracked me like a rare crane.

920
01:02:53,859 --> 01:02:56,027
But please, believe one thing.

921
01:02:56,028 --> 01:03:01,533
I cremed Fidel three times
when he was in Bucharest years ago.

922
01:03:01,534 --> 01:03:05,912
I am an action painter of cremed pies.

923
01:03:05,913 --> 01:03:07,664
I...

924
01:03:07,665 --> 01:03:13,002
Dropped from a tree on Michael Jordan one time.
This was the famous Flying Pie.

925
01:03:13,045 --> 01:03:17,006
Museum quality.
Video for the ages.

926
01:03:17,007 --> 01:03:22,971
I quiched the fucking
sultan of Brunei in his bath.

927
01:03:22,972 --> 01:03:28,393
They put me in black hole until
I was screaming for my eyes.

928
01:03:31,647 --> 01:03:34,274
Okay, let's go.

929
01:04:01,051 --> 01:04:02,594
Do you play?

930
01:04:04,889 --> 01:04:07,348
Not really my game.

931
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:11,936
Rugby...
Now that was my game.

932
01:04:13,105 --> 01:04:14,898
You play?

933
01:04:16,066 --> 01:04:17,942
Some.

934
01:04:19,904 --> 01:04:22,489
I like the action and the pain.

935
01:04:23,866 --> 01:04:25,575
Pump iron now.

936
01:04:27,244 --> 01:04:31,331
Of course you understand.
There's still someone tracking you.

937
01:04:32,416 --> 01:04:34,459
Still someone out there.

938
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:38,004
This was a petty incursion.

939
01:04:38,297 --> 01:04:42,967
The whipped cream.
Technically irrelevant.

940
01:04:43,886 --> 01:04:45,595
I understand.

941
01:04:45,596 --> 01:04:48,723
Next time, no pies and cake.

942
01:04:49,308 --> 01:04:51,684
Dessert... is over.

943
01:04:52,478 --> 01:04:58,107
Yeah, he's out there.
And he's armed.

944
01:05:01,779 --> 01:05:04,030
He's armed and you're armed.

945
01:05:04,532 --> 01:05:06,407
This is true.

946
01:05:07,535 --> 01:05:09,619
You'll have to draw your weapon.

947
01:05:10,871 --> 01:05:12,497
This is true.

948
01:05:16,001 --> 01:05:18,336
Let me see the thing.

949
01:05:18,671 --> 01:05:21,297
Let you see the thing?

950
01:05:23,926 --> 01:05:25,343
Okay.

951
01:05:25,344 --> 01:05:29,889
Why not, you paid for it, right?

952
01:05:31,475 --> 01:05:34,352
Manufactured in Austria.

953
01:05:35,396 --> 01:05:37,188
Nice.

954
01:05:37,857 --> 01:05:40,859
Smart tool.
Scary smart.

955
01:05:42,486 --> 01:05:44,362
Voice recognition.

956
01:05:44,363 --> 01:05:46,447
That's right.

957
01:05:47,783 --> 01:05:50,493
You, what, you speak and
it knows your voice?

958
01:05:50,494 --> 01:05:52,078
That's right.

959
01:05:52,454 --> 01:05:57,667
The mechanism doesn't activate unless
the voice print matches the stored data.

960
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:00,670
Only my voice matches.

961
01:06:03,632 --> 01:06:06,176
You have to speak German
before it fires?

962
01:06:06,927 --> 01:06:10,513
No, but the voice is
only half the operation.

963
01:06:12,766 --> 01:06:14,642
You're saying there's a code as well.

964
01:06:14,643 --> 01:06:17,645
Preprogrammed spoken code.

965
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:20,899
What is it?

966
01:06:26,322 --> 01:06:29,574
Nancy Babich.

967
01:07:09,073 --> 01:07:10,782
We are here.

968
01:07:51,198 --> 01:07:54,909
But how come you're such
a stranger lately?

969
01:07:55,286 --> 01:07:56,995
Hello, Anthony.

970
01:07:59,582 --> 01:08:01,583
Long time.

971
01:08:02,251 --> 01:08:03,668
Long time.

972
01:08:03,878 --> 01:08:05,753
I need a haircut.

973
01:08:05,754 --> 01:08:07,839
You look like what?

974
01:08:08,757 --> 01:08:10,466
Get in here
so I can look at you

975
01:08:18,726 --> 01:08:22,395
Never seen such ratty hair on a human.

976
01:08:24,315 --> 01:08:26,858
I woke up this morning
and knew it was time.

977
01:08:26,859 --> 01:08:28,943
You knew where to come.

978
01:08:30,279 --> 01:08:34,699
Said to myself:
"I want a haircut".

979
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,368
Maybe you wanna eat something first.

980
01:08:38,954 --> 01:08:40,663
I could eat something.

981
01:08:40,873 --> 01:08:46,294
I have takeout in the fridge that
I nibble at it when I get the urge.

982
01:08:59,975 --> 01:09:03,478
So, you married that woman?

983
01:09:04,313 --> 01:09:05,355
That's right.

984
01:09:05,481 --> 01:09:10,485
That her family has got like money
unbeknownst.

985
01:09:11,362 --> 01:09:15,949
Never thought you'd get married so young, but...
what do I know?

986
01:09:17,243 --> 01:09:23,832
I have chickpeas all mashed up and
eggplants with rice and nuts.

987
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:26,751
- Give me the eggplants.
- Yeah. Good.

988
01:09:28,379 --> 01:09:32,006
You father did not tell
your mother until he had to.

989
01:09:32,591 --> 01:09:37,554
He went fast once they found it.
He was diagnosed and then he went.

990
01:09:37,847 --> 01:09:40,723
You were four years old.

991
01:09:41,267 --> 01:09:42,183
Five.

992
01:09:42,184 --> 01:09:43,893
Exactly.

993
01:09:43,894 --> 01:09:45,311
And you?

994
01:09:45,938 --> 01:09:47,480
You're keeping well?

995
01:09:47,481 --> 01:09:51,943
You know me kid.
I could tell you I can't complain.

996
01:09:51,944 --> 01:09:57,949
But I could definitely complain.
The thing is, I don't want to.

997
01:09:58,450 --> 01:10:01,578
Let me thing what I have
that we could drink.

998
01:10:01,912 --> 01:10:09,961
Water from the tap, I drink water now.
I have a bottle of liqueur that's been there don't ask how long.

999
01:10:10,671 --> 01:10:12,297
I could drink some of that.

1000
01:10:12,298 --> 01:10:18,136
Because if your father himself walked in here
and I offered him tap water

1001
01:10:18,137 --> 01:10:24,225
oh God forbid, he would rip out my last hair.

1002
01:10:24,518 --> 01:10:27,562
Maybe we could ask my driver to come in
my driver is outside in the car.

1003
01:10:27,563 --> 01:10:31,816
Oh, we could give him the other eggplants.

1004
01:10:36,947 --> 01:10:41,784
I drove a checkered
cab. Big. Bouncy.

1005
01:10:42,119 --> 01:10:47,665
I drove nights. I was young.
What could they do to me?

1006
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:50,084
Night is not so good if you have
a wife and child.

1007
01:10:50,085 --> 01:10:54,464
Besides, I can tell you, it was crazy enough
in the daytime.

1008
01:10:54,465 --> 01:10:56,549
I loved my cab.

1009
01:10:57,384 --> 01:11:04,182
I drove twelve hours non-stop.
I stopped only to pee.

1010
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:09,854
A man is hit one day by another taxi.
Comes flying into my taxi.

1011
01:11:09,855 --> 01:11:13,274
I mean, he was flying in the air,
crashed against the windscreen.

1012
01:11:13,275 --> 01:11:17,278
Right there in my face.
Blood is everywhere.

1013
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:21,866
I never left my garage without my Windex.

1014
01:11:22,409 --> 01:11:25,703
I am Acting Secretary of
External Affairs in a previous life.

1015
01:11:25,704 --> 01:11:31,417
I said to him. Get off from there.
I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.

1016
01:11:31,418 --> 01:11:37,173
I ate at the wheel.
I kept my sandwiches in tinfoil.

1017
01:11:37,466 --> 01:11:41,719
I ate at the wheel also.
I could not afford to stop driving.

1018
01:11:44,348 --> 01:11:49,435
Where did you pee, Ibrahim?
I peed under the Manhattan Bridge.

1019
01:11:49,645 --> 01:11:51,563
This is where I peed exactly.

1020
01:11:51,564 --> 01:11:56,985
I peed in parks and alleys.
I peed in the pet cemetery once.

1021
01:11:57,903 --> 01:12:02,282
Night is better in some ways,
I am certain of it.

1022
01:12:05,661 --> 01:12:11,207
I was here, what?
Probably four hours a day.

1023
01:12:11,208 --> 01:12:16,629
Helping my father cut hair. Nights,
I drove my cab. I loved my cab.

1024
01:12:18,174 --> 01:12:24,387
I had a little fan that worked on battery,
because air conditioning

1025
01:12:24,388 --> 01:12:28,349
forget about it in that day and age.
And then, I had a drinking cup

1026
01:12:28,559 --> 01:12:32,228
with a magnet that I stuck on the dashboard.

1027
01:12:32,771 --> 01:12:39,694
I had my steering wheel upholstered, very nice, in zebra.
And my daughter, with her photograph on the visor.

1028
01:12:40,112 --> 01:12:43,156
I give this guy his first haircut.

1029
01:12:44,074 --> 01:12:47,327
He didn't want to sit in the car seat.

1030
01:12:47,495 --> 01:12:54,125
His father tried to jam him in there.
He was going "no, no, no, no!"

1031
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:59,756
So I put him right where you're sitting now.
His father pinned him down.

1032
01:12:59,757 --> 01:13:05,887
I cut his father hair when he was a kid.
Yeah, I cut his hair.

1033
01:13:07,973 --> 01:13:14,479
Where is the chief of security in this situation?
I realized he's not with us.

1034
01:13:14,688 --> 01:13:16,564
We are alone.

1035
01:13:18,067 --> 01:13:20,735
I gave him the rest of the night off.

1036
01:13:21,821 --> 01:13:25,490
You have protection, right, in the car?

1037
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:27,283
Protection?

1038
01:13:27,284 --> 01:13:30,620
Protection.
You know what that means?

1039
01:13:31,121 --> 01:13:32,622
I had a gun, but
I threw it away.

1040
01:13:32,623 --> 01:13:34,332
But why?

1041
01:13:37,294 --> 01:13:40,880
I didn't want to make plans.
I wasn't thinking ahead.

1042
01:13:40,881 --> 01:13:42,966
Didn't want to take precautions.

1043
01:13:43,008 --> 01:13:45,510
You know how that sounds?
How does it sound?

1044
01:13:45,594 --> 01:13:48,346
I thought you were some kind of big shot

1045
01:13:48,347 --> 01:13:54,310
that destroyed people in a blink of an eye.
But you sound pretty iffy to me.

1046
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:59,524
This is Mike Packer's kid that had
a gun and threw it away?

1047
01:13:59,859 --> 01:14:01,192
What is that?

1048
01:14:01,193 --> 01:14:02,777
Yes, what is that?

1049
01:14:02,778 --> 01:14:06,114
Yeah. In this part of town
and you had a gun

1050
01:14:06,615 --> 01:14:09,117
There are steps you must
to take to save-guard yourself.

1051
01:14:09,118 --> 01:14:11,202
In this part of town

1052
01:14:11,203 --> 01:14:16,040
you cannot walk five meters after dark,
you'd be careless. They'd kill you straight away.

1053
01:14:16,041 --> 01:14:21,129
You'd be reasonable with them?
They'll take a little longer, tear out your entrails first.

1054
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:29,429
What happened to your eye that got all twisted that way?

1055
01:14:31,182 --> 01:14:37,395
I can see. I can drive.
I passed their tests.

1056
01:14:40,024 --> 01:14:42,400
You were beaten and tortured.

1057
01:14:42,735 --> 01:14:44,486
An army coup.

1058
01:14:44,987 --> 01:14:46,571
By the secret police.

1059
01:14:47,239 --> 01:14:52,076
Or they thought they executed you.
Fired a shot to your face.

1060
01:14:52,077 --> 01:14:54,162
Left you for dead.

1061
01:14:56,540 --> 01:15:01,920
I loved my cab.
I gulped my food.

1062
01:15:02,505 --> 01:15:09,511
I drove twelve hours straight night after night.
Vacations? Forget about.

1063
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:13,139
But what did I do for protection?

1064
01:15:40,459 --> 01:15:42,377
I need to leave.

1065
01:15:42,419 --> 01:15:43,711
How come?

1066
01:15:46,549 --> 01:15:48,675
I don't know how come.

1067
01:15:48,884 --> 01:15:50,301
That's how come.

1068
01:15:50,302 --> 01:15:53,805
But let me do the left side, at least.
So both sides are equal.

1069
01:15:53,848 --> 01:15:56,766
I'll come back.
Take my work for it.

1070
01:15:56,767 --> 01:16:00,436
I'll sit and you'll finish.

1071
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:16,911
Ibrahim.
Tell me this.

1072
01:16:16,912 --> 01:16:18,204
Yes.

1073
01:16:21,083 --> 01:16:26,671
These stretched limousines that fill the streets.
I've been wondering.

1074
01:16:26,881 --> 01:16:28,756
Yes?

1075
01:16:32,887 --> 01:16:35,221
Where are they parked at night?

1076
01:16:36,348 --> 01:16:43,688
They need large tracts of space.
Out near the airports or somewhere in the Meadowlands.

1077
01:16:44,106 --> 01:16:48,568
Long Island.
New Jersey.

1078
01:16:48,777 --> 01:16:53,114
I will go to New Jersey.
The limo stays here.

1079
01:16:57,286 --> 01:17:01,414
Next block there would be an
underground garage. Limos only.

1080
01:17:01,499 --> 01:17:07,712
I would drop off your car, pick up my car
then drive home, through the stinking tunnel.

1081
01:17:43,749 --> 01:17:48,461
Early in the morning, you could see, right here
teams of men in white coveralls

1082
01:17:48,462 --> 01:17:54,592
they are washing limousines.
A marketplace of limos, rags flying.

1083
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:47,645
Eric Michael Packer!

1084
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,198
Nancy Babich.

1085
01:21:25,054 --> 01:21:26,304
What are you doing here?

1086
01:21:26,305 --> 01:21:28,223
That's not the question.

1087
01:21:28,766 --> 01:21:31,976
The question is yours to answer.
Why do you wanna kill me?

1088
01:21:32,978 --> 01:21:36,898
Now, that's not the question.
That's too easy to be the question.

1089
01:21:39,068 --> 01:21:43,321
I want to kill you because I want
to count for something in my whole life.

1090
01:21:45,491 --> 01:21:46,991
See how easy?

1091
01:21:49,787 --> 01:21:54,040
You're not a reflective man.
I live consciously in my head.

1092
01:21:55,668 --> 01:21:57,252
Give me a cigarette.

1093
01:21:57,253 --> 01:21:59,337
Give me a drink.

1094
01:22:00,506 --> 01:22:02,090
Do you recognize me?

1095
01:22:02,091 --> 01:22:04,175
I can't see you clearly.

1096
01:22:05,594 --> 01:22:08,805
Sit.
We'll talk.

1097
01:22:09,932 --> 01:22:10,890
Yes.

1098
01:22:12,059 --> 01:22:13,518
I'd like that.

1099
01:22:19,525 --> 01:22:24,863
Sit and talk.
I've had a long day.

1100
01:22:25,656 --> 01:22:27,782
Things.
People.

1101
01:22:29,118 --> 01:22:33,371
Time for a philosophical pause.
Some reflection.

1102
01:22:33,914 --> 01:22:35,707
Yes.

1103
01:22:42,756 --> 01:22:46,593
You're not familiar with that weapon.
I fired that weapon.

1104
01:22:46,594 --> 01:22:50,597
That's a serious weapon.
Whereas this...

1105
01:22:52,808 --> 01:22:56,478
I'm thinking of installing a shooting range
in my apartment.

1106
01:22:57,146 --> 01:23:01,649
Why not your office?
Line them up and shoot them.

1107
01:23:02,568 --> 01:23:06,738
You know the office, is that right?
You've been in the office.

1108
01:23:06,906 --> 01:23:09,073
Tell me who you think I am.

1109
01:23:09,366 --> 01:23:11,409
I don't know who are you.

1110
01:23:25,716 --> 01:23:28,009
Maybe if you'd tell me your name.

1111
01:23:28,010 --> 01:23:30,094
You wouldn't know my name.

1112
01:23:30,304 --> 01:23:34,224
I know names more than faces.
Tell me.

1113
01:23:34,225 --> 01:23:36,309
Benno Levin.

1114
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:39,979
That's a phony name.
It's phony. It's fake.

1115
01:23:40,189 --> 01:23:42,023
It's fake, it isn't real.

1116
01:23:42,191 --> 01:23:46,236
But I think I recognize you now, you were
at the cash machine out side the bank

1117
01:23:46,237 --> 01:23:48,321
some time around noon.

1118
01:23:50,366 --> 01:23:51,449
You saw me.

1119
01:23:51,700 --> 01:23:55,870
You looked familiar.
I didn't know why.

1120
01:23:56,372 --> 01:23:58,623
Maybe you used to work for me.

1121
01:23:58,958 --> 01:24:01,793
Hate me, wanna to kill me. Fine.

1122
01:24:02,586 --> 01:24:06,548
Everything in our lives...
yours and mine

1123
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,468
has brought us to this moment.

1124
01:24:12,096 --> 01:24:13,388
Fine.

1125
01:24:16,809 --> 01:24:21,354
I could use a tall beer
about now.

1126
01:24:23,566 --> 01:24:25,984
How old are you?
I'm interested.

1127
01:24:25,985 --> 01:24:28,319
Do you think people
like me can't happen?

1128
01:24:28,487 --> 01:24:30,864
- How old?
- We happen.

1129
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:32,115
Forty-one.

1130
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,242
Prime number.

1131
01:24:34,243 --> 01:24:37,036
But... not an interesting one.

1132
01:24:39,456 --> 01:24:44,377
Or did I turn forty-two. It's possible, because
I don't keep track. Because why should I?

1133
01:24:50,342 --> 01:24:53,344
I've become an enigma to myself.

1134
01:24:54,805 --> 01:24:57,515
So said St. Augustine.

1135
01:24:59,018 --> 01:25:01,519
And herein lies my sickness.

1136
01:25:01,645 --> 01:25:06,399
Well, that's a start. It's a crucial self-realization.
I'm not talking about myself.

1137
01:25:07,276 --> 01:25:11,112
I'm talking about you.
Your whole waking life

1138
01:25:11,113 --> 01:25:15,700
is a self-contradiction. That's why you're
engineering your own downfall.

1139
01:25:18,287 --> 01:25:20,705
Why are you here?

1140
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:24,792
That's the first thing I said to you
when I came out of the toilet.

1141
01:25:25,044 --> 01:25:26,878
I noticed the toilet.

1142
01:25:28,839 --> 01:25:31,382
It's the first thing
I've noticed when I walked in the room.

1143
01:25:38,098 --> 01:25:40,141
What happens to your waste?

1144
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:49,150
There's a... There's a whole below the fixture.
I knocked a hole in the floor

1145
01:25:50,152 --> 01:25:54,197
then I positioned the toilet so that
one hole fits over the other.

1146
01:25:54,698 --> 01:25:58,243
Holes are interesting.
There're books about holes.

1147
01:25:58,244 --> 01:26:02,080
There're books about...
shit.

1148
01:26:03,249 --> 01:26:06,209
But we wanna know why you would willingly

1149
01:26:06,210 --> 01:26:10,463
enter a house where there's someone
inside that's prepared to kill you.

1150
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:14,008
Alright, tell me.
Why am I here?

1151
01:26:14,927 --> 01:26:17,887
You have to tell me.

1152
01:26:21,183 --> 01:26:23,852
Some kind of unexpected failure.

1153
01:26:25,271 --> 01:26:27,897
Shocked your self-esteem.

1154
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:35,655
The yuan.

1155
01:26:36,907 --> 01:26:38,950
I couldn't figure out the yuan.

1156
01:26:44,123 --> 01:26:46,499
The yuan?

1157
01:26:48,878 --> 01:26:51,379
I couldn't chart the yuan.

1158
01:26:54,216 --> 01:26:55,842
The yuan eluded me.

1159
01:26:55,843 --> 01:26:59,095
And so you brought everything down.

1160
01:27:01,557 --> 01:27:04,225
This had never happened.

1161
01:27:05,978 --> 01:27:07,562
I've become half-hearted.

1162
01:27:07,563 --> 01:27:10,273
This is because you only have half heart.

1163
01:27:11,317 --> 01:27:13,401
Give me a cigarette.

1164
01:27:14,987 --> 01:27:16,988
I don't smoke cigarettes.

1165
01:27:24,538 --> 01:27:27,207
Huge ambition and contempt...

1166
01:27:27,666 --> 01:27:29,876
I can...

1167
01:27:30,085 --> 01:27:34,589
list the things, name the appetites,
people.

1168
01:27:35,841 --> 01:27:40,261
Mistreat some, ignore some.
Persecute others.

1169
01:27:41,263 --> 01:27:43,598
The self-totality.

1170
01:27:44,391 --> 01:27:46,851
The lack of remorse.

1171
01:27:48,187 --> 01:27:49,854
These are your gifts.

1172
01:27:49,855 --> 01:27:51,940
What else?

1173
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:59,906
Intuition of early death.

1174
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:01,366
What else?

1175
01:28:01,742 --> 01:28:03,451
What else...

1176
01:28:06,872 --> 01:28:08,665
Secret doubts.

1177
01:28:10,459 --> 01:28:13,127
Doubts that you
could never acknowledge.

1178
01:28:13,337 --> 01:28:15,213
You know some things.

1179
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:20,135
I know you smoke cigars.

1180
01:28:24,265 --> 01:28:28,351
I know everything that's ever
said or written about you.

1181
01:28:30,396 --> 01:28:32,897
I know what I see in your face

1182
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,734
after years of study.

1183
01:28:37,611 --> 01:28:40,280
You worked for me, doing what?

1184
01:28:45,327 --> 01:28:49,247
Currency analysis.
I worked on the baht.

1185
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:52,333
The baht is interesting.
I loved the baht!

1186
01:28:52,793 --> 01:28:59,841
But your system is so micro-timed that I couldn't
keep up with it. I couldn't find it. It is so infinitesimal!

1187
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:04,637
Then I began to hate
my work and you

1188
01:29:04,638 --> 01:29:08,475
and all the numbers on my screen
and every minute of my life.

1189
01:29:08,851 --> 01:29:11,352
One hundred satang to the baht.

1190
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:17,192
What's your real name?

1191
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:19,944
You wouldn't know it.

1192
01:29:20,154 --> 01:29:22,030
Tell me your name.

1193
01:29:25,159 --> 01:29:27,702
Sheets.
Richard Sheets.

1194
01:29:30,039 --> 01:29:31,706
Means nothing to me.

1195
01:29:34,084 --> 01:29:39,464
Tell me: do you imagine that I stole
ideas from you?

1196
01:29:40,049 --> 01:29:42,884
Intellectual property.
What does anyone imagine?

1197
01:29:43,302 --> 01:29:46,179
A hundreds things a minute.

1198
01:29:48,682 --> 01:29:54,062
Whether I imagine a thing or not,
it's real to me.

1199
01:29:54,063 --> 01:29:57,398
I have syndromes. Where they real?

1200
01:29:59,985 --> 01:30:02,487
From Malaysia, for example.

1201
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:08,576
The things that I believe become facts.
They have the time and space of facts.

1202
01:30:08,577 --> 01:30:11,579
You're forcing me to be reasonable.
I don't like that.

1203
01:30:12,915 --> 01:30:17,210
I have severe anxieties that my sex
organ is receding into my body.

1204
01:30:17,211 --> 01:30:18,211
But it's not.

1205
01:30:18,212 --> 01:30:20,296
Shrinking into my abdomen.

1206
01:30:20,297 --> 01:30:21,089
But it's not.

1207
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:24,259
Either it is or not, I know it.

1208
01:30:26,428 --> 01:30:28,138
Show me.

1209
01:30:31,142 --> 01:30:35,478
I don't have to look.
There are folk beliefs.

1210
01:30:35,646 --> 01:30:41,484
There are epidemics that happen,
men in the thousands in real fear and pain.

1211
01:30:41,485 --> 01:30:44,988
Alright.
Alright.

1212
01:30:46,949 --> 01:30:50,743
People like you can't happen.
I understand this.

1213
01:30:50,953 --> 01:30:55,915
I believe it, but not the violence. No the gun.
The gun is all wrong.

1214
01:30:56,250 --> 01:30:58,459
You're not a violent man.

1215
01:30:59,962 --> 01:31:04,507
Violence is meant to be real
based on real motives,

1216
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:10,263
on forces in the world that, what, make us want
to defend ourselves or take aggressive actions.

1217
01:31:10,806 --> 01:31:14,976
The crime you want to commit
is cheap imitation.

1218
01:31:14,977 --> 01:31:20,440
It's a stale fantasy.
People do it because other people do it.

1219
01:31:25,154 --> 01:31:30,158
It's just another syndrome,
it's a thing you caught from others.

1220
01:31:31,702 --> 01:31:36,164
It has no history.
It's all history, the whole thing is history.

1221
01:31:36,624 --> 01:31:41,252
You are foully and berserkly rich.

1222
01:31:41,921 --> 01:31:44,798
Don't tell me about
your charities.

1223
01:31:44,799 --> 01:31:47,425
I have no charities.

1224
01:31:49,637 --> 01:31:52,680
You don't resent the rich,
that's not your sensibility.

1225
01:31:52,681 --> 01:31:54,766
What's my sensibility?

1226
01:31:54,767 --> 01:31:59,270
Confusion! This is why
you're unemployable. Why?

1227
01:31:59,271 --> 01:32:02,690
Because you wanna kill people.
That's not why I'm unemployable.

1228
01:32:02,691 --> 01:32:06,110
Then why?
Because I stink.

1229
01:32:07,196 --> 01:32:10,782
Smell me!

1230
01:32:10,783 --> 01:32:17,789
Even when you self-destruct, you have to fail
more, lose more, die more, stink more than others.

1231
01:32:20,668 --> 01:32:28,299
In... in the old tribes, the chief that destroyed more
property than the other chiefs, was the most powerful.

1232
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:30,385
What else?

1233
01:32:30,386 --> 01:32:34,222
You have everything to live for,
I have nothing and neither.

1234
01:32:34,223 --> 01:32:36,724
That's another
reason to kill you.

1235
01:32:36,725 --> 01:32:37,517
Richard!

1236
01:32:37,518 --> 01:32:40,228
I want to be known as Benno!

1237
01:32:42,106 --> 01:32:45,733
You're unsettled 'cause you
feel you have no role.

1238
01:32:46,152 --> 01:32:48,111
You have no place.

1239
01:32:50,447 --> 01:32:53,408
But you have to ask yourself
whose fault you that is?

1240
01:32:54,326 --> 01:32:59,497
'Cause, in fact, there's very little in the society
that you have to hate. Think!

1241
01:33:00,666 --> 01:33:02,292
Think.

1242
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:10,258
Violence...
needs a cause.

1243
01:33:11,260 --> 01:33:12,635
A truth.

1244
01:33:15,222 --> 01:33:19,601
There's nothing in
the world but other people.

1245
01:33:22,813 --> 01:33:27,942
I had this thought one day.
It was the thought of my life.

1246
01:33:28,777 --> 01:33:31,070
I'm surrounded by
other people.

1247
01:33:33,532 --> 01:33:39,120
It's "buy and sell". It's "let's have lunch".
I thought "look at them and look at me".

1248
01:33:41,582 --> 01:33:49,964
Light shines through me on the street.
I'm, what's the word, pervious to visible light.

1249
01:33:51,967 --> 01:33:54,886
I thought, "all these other people",
I thought...

1250
01:33:55,805 --> 01:33:58,473
How do they get to be
who they are?

1251
01:34:00,184 --> 01:34:01,059
It's...

1252
01:34:01,894 --> 01:34:08,900
...banks and car parks. It's airline tickets and their
computers. It's... restaurants filled with people

1253
01:34:08,901 --> 01:34:12,946
talking. It's people signing
the merchant copy.

1254
01:34:12,988 --> 01:34:16,533
It's people taking the merchant
copy out of the leather folder

1255
01:34:16,534 --> 01:34:19,327
and then signing it and
separating merchant copy

1256
01:34:19,328 --> 01:34:25,625
If I'm the customer copy and putting the credit
card back in their pocket, this alone could do it.

1257
01:34:27,086 --> 01:34:32,966
It's people who have doctors that order
tests for them. This alone...

1258
01:34:36,595 --> 01:34:41,349
I'm helpless in their system that makes no sense to me.

1259
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:46,229
You want me to be a helpless robot soldier

1260
01:34:47,106 --> 01:34:50,525
and all I could be was helpless.
o.

1261
01:34:50,526 --> 01:34:55,989
It's women shoes.
It's all the names they have for shoes.

1262
01:34:57,783 --> 01:35:01,536
It's all those people in the park, behind the library.

1263
01:35:04,331 --> 01:35:06,499
Talking in the sun.

1264
01:35:10,838 --> 01:35:13,423
Your crime has no conscience.

1265
01:35:14,175 --> 01:35:19,345
You haven't been driven to it by some
oppressive social force.

1266
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:21,431
I hate to be reasonable.

1267
01:35:24,143 --> 01:35:27,687
You're not against the rich.
Nobody is against the rich.

1268
01:35:28,147 --> 01:35:31,357
Everybody is ten seconds away from being
rich, or so that everybody thought.

1269
01:35:32,151 --> 01:35:33,443
No.

1270
01:35:36,322 --> 01:35:38,656
Your crime is in your head.

1271
01:35:39,658 --> 01:35:47,290
Another fool shooting up a diner because
Bullets flying through the walls. So useless and stupid.

1272
01:35:49,585 --> 01:35:53,505
Even your weapon is a fantasy.
What is it called?

1273
01:35:55,341 --> 01:35:58,551
What are the attachments mounted on the barrel?
What are they called, what do they do?

1274
01:35:58,552 --> 01:36:00,220
Alright.

1275
01:36:01,347 --> 01:36:07,644
I don't have the manhood to know these names. Men
know these names. You have the experience of manhood.

1276
01:36:08,187 --> 01:36:11,981
I can't think that far ahead.

1277
01:36:13,025 --> 01:36:15,985
It's all I can do to be a person.

1278
01:36:20,199 --> 01:36:24,327
Violence needs a burden.

1279
01:36:25,538 --> 01:36:28,081
It needs a purpose.

1280
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,877
What are you doing?

1281
01:36:35,089 --> 01:36:37,090
I don't know.

1282
01:36:38,551 --> 01:36:40,301
Maybe nothing.

1283
01:37:13,002 --> 01:37:15,378
My prostate is asymmetrical.

1284
01:37:17,798 --> 01:37:19,841
So is mine.

1285
01:37:24,555 --> 01:37:26,681
What does it mean?

1286
01:37:36,358 --> 01:37:41,946
Nothing, it means nothing.
It's harmless. A harmless variation.

1287
01:37:42,031 --> 01:37:46,868
Nothing to worry about.
At your age, why worry?

1288
01:37:49,079 --> 01:37:51,498
You should have listened to your prostate.

1289
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:56,669
You tried to predict movements on the yuan
by drawing on patterns from nature.

1290
01:37:56,670 --> 01:38:00,715
Yes, of course, the mathematical
properties of tree rings.

1291
01:38:01,383 --> 01:38:07,388
Sunflower seeds. The limbs of galactic spirals.
I've learned this with the baht.

1292
01:38:07,389 --> 01:38:12,393
I loved the cross-harmonies between nature
and data. You've taught me this.

1293
01:38:12,394 --> 01:38:17,148
You've made this form of analysis horribly
and sadistically precise.

1294
01:38:17,358 --> 01:38:19,776
But you forgot something along the way?

1295
01:38:19,902 --> 01:38:21,152
What?

1296
01:38:21,278 --> 01:38:26,866
The importance of the lopsided.
The thing that's skewed a little.

1297
01:38:28,327 --> 01:38:30,787
You were looking for balance.

1298
01:38:30,788 --> 01:38:35,083
Beautiful balance, equal parts,
equal sides, I know this.

1299
01:38:35,876 --> 01:38:37,669
I know you.

1300
01:38:39,588 --> 01:38:43,967
But you should have been tracking
the yuan in its ticks and quirks.

1301
01:38:44,844 --> 01:38:48,096
A little quirk.
A misshape.

1302
01:38:49,598 --> 01:38:50,598
The misweave.

1303
01:38:50,599 --> 01:38:55,270
That's where the answer was.
In your body, in your prostate.

1304
01:39:04,530 --> 01:39:06,614
But I still have to shoot you.

1305
01:39:12,621 --> 01:39:15,915
Don't you ever walked through the park behind the library

1306
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:21,129
and see all those people setting in their little chairs
and drinking at those tables

1307
01:39:21,714 --> 01:39:25,967
on the terrace, after work, and hear
their voices mingling in the air

1308
01:39:25,968 --> 01:39:28,636
and want to kill them?

1309
01:39:29,722 --> 01:39:31,055
No.

1310
01:39:33,225 --> 01:39:37,103
I'm having my Korean
panic attack.

1311
01:39:39,982 --> 01:39:45,153
That's from holding
in my anger all those years.

1312
01:39:47,865 --> 01:39:50,033
But not anymore.

1313
01:39:50,409 --> 01:39:53,870
You have to die, no matter what.

1314
01:39:55,372 --> 01:39:59,209
I can tell you my situation
has changed in the course of a day.

1315
01:40:01,545 --> 01:40:09,677
I have my syndromes, you have your complex.
Icarus falling. You did it to yourself!

1316
01:40:11,263 --> 01:40:14,265
Meltdown in the sun.

1317
01:40:14,266 --> 01:40:19,979
You will plunge three and half feet to your death.
It's not very heroic. Is it?

1318
01:40:31,033 --> 01:40:36,287
Even if there's a fungus
between my toes that speaks to me.

1319
01:40:38,332 --> 01:40:43,795
Even if the fungus told me to kill you. Even then, your death
is justified because of where you stand on Earth.

1320
01:40:44,171 --> 01:40:47,590
For your apartment and what you paid for it.

1321
01:40:48,175 --> 01:40:52,512
For you daily medical checkups.
This alone...

1322
01:40:54,098 --> 01:40:58,601
Medical checkups,
every day.

1323
01:41:00,187 --> 01:41:05,650
For the limousine that displaces the air
that people need to breath in Bangladesh.

1324
01:41:05,693 --> 01:41:07,610
This alone.

1325
01:41:08,904 --> 01:41:10,822
Don't make me laugh.

1326
01:41:12,658 --> 01:41:14,784
Don't make you laugh?

1327
01:41:17,538 --> 01:41:21,666
You just made that up. You've never spend
a minute of your life worrying about other people.

1328
01:41:25,129 --> 01:41:26,546
Alright.

1329
01:41:29,258 --> 01:41:34,304
But the air you breath,
this alone, the thought you have...

1330
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:41,853
Is there a fungus that
speaks to you? I'm serious.

1331
01:41:42,229 --> 01:41:46,107
People hear things. They hear God.

1332
01:41:55,951 --> 01:42:02,373
Anyway, you're already dead. You look like someone
already dead. Someone dead a hundred years.

1333
01:42:03,834 --> 01:42:06,961
Many centuries dead.
Kings dead.

1334
01:42:08,297 --> 01:42:12,258
Royals in their pajamas
eating mutton.

1335
01:42:15,596 --> 01:42:19,641
Have I ever used the word "mutton" in my life?
Came in my head, out of nowhere.

1336
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,726
Mutton.

1337
01:42:33,531 --> 01:42:38,743
I wanted you to heal me.
Save me.

1338
01:42:41,539 --> 01:42:44,666
I wanted you to save me.
