00:00:19,124 --> 00:00:22,332
(Man, speaker) Attention,
we apologize to all the passengers.

2
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,999
For the delay incurred
Because of the labor union protest,

3
00:00:25,082 --> 00:00:29,999
Eurostar train 9406 Rome-Milan,
Will depart from platform number 10.

4
00:00:31,207 --> 00:00:34,332
(EXCERPT: "FORBIDDEN ENCOUNTERS"
BY P. PIGEONS)

5
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:20,041
- Hello? It's Andreoli, who is it?
- I'm Iris, the secretary.

6
00:01:20,124 --> 00:01:21,249
Tell me, miss.

7
00:01:21,332 --> 00:01:22,791
The tender is here this morning,

8
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:25,374
his answer came
On the committee table.

9
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:27,332
But is the minister aware of it ?

10
00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:30,332
Yes, the minister said.
To visit him in his office.

11
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:34,207
No, no, no ! I don't do antichambers
In the corridors of ministries !

12
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:37,041
If the minister wants me,
he knows my address.

13
00:01:37,124 --> 00:01:39,999
- Do you understand ?
- Damn, what a character !

14
00:01:40,082 --> 00:01:43,749
- Do you always wake up in a bad mood ?
- Yes, yes, I have a bad temper.

15
00:01:43,832 --> 00:01:45,707
Miss, let me go, the train is leaving.

16
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,166
- Goodbye, see you tomorrow.
- Goodbye.

17
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:52,749
But how,
After 30 years you still don't know me ?

18
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,791
Yes, it is as I said.

19
00:01:56,624 --> 00:02:00,457
Papa ?

20
00:02:01,082 --> 00:02:01,916
Papa ?

21
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,624
- Papa, Papa !
- Are you talking to me?

22
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:08,374
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

23
00:02:10,624 --> 00:02:12,874
Do you think so? "Papa" ?

24
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,666
Miss, now that you understand
That I am not papà,

25
00:02:18,749 --> 00:02:19,999
why are you coming after me?

26
00:02:20,082 --> 00:02:23,707
Me? I'm just looking for my carriage to Bologna, 
number 8.

27
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,374
Number 8 is mine,
I'm going to Bologna, too.

28
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:29,916
Good, so we make the journey together
and keep each other company.

29
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,957
Run, the train is leaving,
walk faster.

30
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,082
Miss, my carriage is this one.

31
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:39,099
Miss, this is my pace, the briefcase is heavy 
and the umbrella bothers me.

32
00:02:39,582 --> 00:02:41,582
- You run, go, go !
- You could have told me.

33
00:02:41,666 --> 00:02:45,999
- Don't be polite, just give me the briefcase.
- What! I don't give the briefcase to anyone.

34
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,124
- Excuse me, don't you trust anyone?
- No, I don't trust anyone.

35
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:51,666
- Why ?
- Because I don't trust anyone.

36
00:02:51,749 --> 00:02:53,457
I trust no one.

37
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,624
- Help me ?
- I just wanted to help you.

38
00:02:56,707 --> 00:03:00,166
I do not need help,
Get your hands off me.

39
00:03:00,249 --> 00:03:02,624
- Oh.
- For God's sake, who touches it!

40
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,957
Where did this come from ?

41
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:09,374
- But who is she ?
- (Controller) People, into the carriage !

42
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,082
Slowly, wait, wait.

43
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,749
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

44
00:03:12,832 --> 00:03:14,749
 - Here I am.
- Here we are .

45
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:17,166
- Come, I'll give you a hand.
- No, I do my own thing.

46
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:20,041
- "Aridaje" with this bag.
- Then give me the umbrella.

47
00:03:20,124 --> 00:03:21,749
- It makes me slip.
- Yes hold on to me.

48
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:24,082
- Gosh, the knee !
- I'm sorry, is he hurt ?

49
00:03:24,166 --> 00:03:26,291
Yes, miss, I hurt myself.

50
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:27,916
- Very bad.
- Sorry.

51
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,624
- It's not my fault.
- For goodness sake, what's you got to do with it? God!

52
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:34,457
It is mine, I alone am to blame.

53
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,666
Why are you shouting? If I knew,
I would not help you.

54
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:40,207
Miss, you would have done your duty.

55
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:43,041
 - Too bad you realized it to late.
- Come, I will help you.

56
00:03:43,124 --> 00:03:45,249
- Come.
- (Armando) Did you see what she did to me?

57
00:03:45,332 --> 00:03:48,457
- (Armando) I banged my knee.
- Are you hurt ?

58
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,874
- (Armando) A tremendous evil.
- Do you know her ?

59
00:03:50,957 --> 00:03:53,166
- No, I don't knows her !
- What did she want from you ?

60
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:54,666
- Briefcase.
- The briefcase ?

61
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:55,957
Yes, the briefcase.

62
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:59,582
Under the guise of helping me,
"Give me the briefcase," she said.

63
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:03,207
- You think she wanted to...
- I think nothing and know nothing.

64
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,124
She asked me three times for the briefcase, though.

65
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:08,457
kind sir, today on the trains  
are travelling professionals.

66
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,874
Beautiful, attractive, they chat
And you don't know how it turns out.

67
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:13,624
Nothing gets to me.

68
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:16,207
Even if they are attractive, I don't trust them.

69
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,499
- is this my suite.
- Here it is, yes.

70
00:04:18,582 --> 00:04:20,666
- It is suite number 2, in the centre of the train.
- Good.

71
00:04:20,749 --> 00:04:23,249
No one will bother you today,
the train is half vacant.

72
00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:24,124
Why is it vacant ?

73
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:26,041
With these annoying strikes

74
00:04:26,124 --> 00:04:28,582
people are afraid
of being left halfway.

75
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,041
Well, and aren't you right ?

76
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,749
Let's hope well.

77
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:33,541
Oh.

78
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:37,291
Travel.

79
00:04:37,374 --> 00:04:41,624
I'm telling you, people who travel
Is an impossible thing.

80
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:43,166
Ah.

81
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,166
(Male, speaker) We inform you.
That the crew

82
00:04:46,249 --> 00:04:48,707
is at your disposal and wish you a safe journey.

83
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,791
oh, thank you,
that's what I need.

84
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:57,374
No one's disturbing me, I'll can do my notes.

85
00:04:57,457 --> 00:05:01,207
Ah, that's good.

86
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,582
Notepads.

87
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,291
And the speech.

88
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:07,416
Here it is.

89
00:05:08,874 --> 00:05:09,707
So.

90
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:13,082
Intervention first.

91
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,416
Dearly beloved.

92
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,124
...Defendants,.

93
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:26,166
Here we go, into the tunnel
and they even turn off the light.

94
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:27,749
But I say to you !

95
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:34,416
(Armando) Well, what's going on?

96
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:38,582
(Armando) Who came in?

97
00:05:41,832 --> 00:05:45,707
(Armando) Oh there, sorry, but who are you?
- It's me..

98
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:48,749
Here she is again, and what are you doing here ?

99
00:05:49,374 --> 00:05:51,207
If you don't mind, I'll settle in here.

100
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:55,041
What, "If you don't mind ?"
This is a private suite.

101
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:56,874
- Is it a private  suite ? I didn't know.
- Yes.

102
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,207
 Ah, you didn't know ?

103
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,166
Be patient, you don't have a ticket
with a reserved seat?

104
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:03,457
Yes, but there are some guys,

105
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,332
who are basketball players
they were bothering me.

106
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:09,291
Really, do you think so ?
Young people are a nuisance.

107
00:06:09,374 --> 00:06:10,582
Well, what does that mean ?

108
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:15,624
I mean it's more fun for you to
take a trip with young people

109
00:06:15,707 --> 00:06:18,541
than come and be bored
with an old man like me.

110
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:20,874
Old ?
Who said you are old ?

111
00:06:20,957 --> 00:06:22,457
All right, never mind.

112
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,832
Spare yourself the compliments, please.

113
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,999
- No compliments.
- Eh, no.

114
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:30,374
I'm just saying that some young people
sometimes they are so boring !

115
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:34,749
It is a matter of opinion.
Is yours this ? Well, let's respect it.

116
00:06:38,124 --> 00:06:41,707
- Can I smoke ?
- "Can I smoke ?" your is already smoking.

117
00:06:42,624 --> 00:06:45,499
Smoke away, I smoke cigars.

118
00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:46,457
- Ah.
- Yes.

119
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:49,999
"Italian Locomotives in the World."

120
00:06:50,082 --> 00:06:51,749
If you don't mind, Can I a take a look.

121
00:06:52,582 --> 00:06:54,124
What is it ? Ah.

122
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:56,749
- Don't miss the mark.
- No.

123
00:06:56,832 --> 00:06:57,666
There is a sign.

124
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:36,624
Ah.

125
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:40,957
Ah.

126
00:07:45,707 --> 00:07:47,082
(Federica) Ah.

127
00:08:31,957 --> 00:08:34,957
Don't tell me you're interested
in steam locomotives ?

128
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,832
Oh, when I was young.

129
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,999
Everything is now electrified.

130
00:08:41,082 --> 00:08:44,749
They are old steamers,
But they give a feeling of great power.

131
00:08:44,832 --> 00:08:45,624
Yes.

132
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:48,582
It must have been very romantic
riding on those trains.

133
00:08:55,041 --> 00:08:56,749
"Locomotive Dakota"

134
00:08:56,832 --> 00:09:00,166
"A project
of Engineer Armando Andreoli."

135
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,291
"for the Brazilian Railways."

136
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:08,166
Don't tell me
That you are the engineer Armando Andreoli ?

137
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:09,499
Yes, miss.

138
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:13,207
If you don't mind,
I designed that locomotive.

139
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:16,541
It is fantastic !
So you have also been to Brazil ?

140
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:19,624
Brazil, Costa Rica, Nicaragua.

141
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,332
You can be say that I worked for the railways
since I was born.

142
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,916
- How wonderful !
- Yes.

143
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:30,749
I am very happy to make this trip
with such an important person.

144
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:33,082
My name is Federica,
can we call each other ?

145
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:33,957
No.

146
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,541
- Why not ?
- Because I don't see any reason, sorry.

147
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:40,374
What is this trend?

148
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:44,374
We barely know each other,
in Bologna we say goodbye,

149
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:47,291
I don't see the reason
For which we must call each other by name.

150
00:09:47,374 --> 00:09:48,416
Excuse me.

151
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:52,749
- Will you stay long in Bologna ?
- Ah, I don't know.

152
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:57,582
- I have a conference, depending on how it goes.
- Ah.

153
00:09:58,499 --> 00:09:59,749
Are you married ?

154
00:10:00,582 --> 00:10:01,416
Yes.

155
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:05,082
- Isn't your wife coming with you ?
- No.

156
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,416
- Why ?
- I am a widower.

157
00:10:08,499 --> 00:10:09,707
Ah.

158
00:10:13,124 --> 00:10:14,749
Where are you staying here in Bologna ?

159
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,082
 How, where do I stay ?

160
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,999
As in,
Which hotel are you sleeping in tonight ?

161
00:10:21,082 --> 00:10:22,832
If you permit, I will not tell you.

162
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:23,749
Why ?

163
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:28,249
Because I have a bad temper
And I am also wary.

164
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:30,166
Ah, excuse me.

165
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,124
Wary of me ?

166
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:37,374
Not just you, I distrust all people
I don't know,

167
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:39,124
And because I don't know you,

168
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:41,666
I don't see the reason
For which I must tell you.

169
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:43,416
Where I am sleeping tonight in Bologna.

170
00:10:43,957 --> 00:10:45,041
But what is the harm ?

171
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:47,249
What's wrong with that ?

172
00:10:47,332 --> 00:10:51,749
It's that I don't know if I'm sleeping in Bologna,
Because if there is no strike,

173
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:53,916
I leave on the first train to Rome.

174
00:10:55,249 --> 00:10:56,374
What if there is a strike ?

175
00:10:56,874 --> 00:10:57,999
If there is a strike ?

176
00:10:58,082 --> 00:11:01,041
No more questions,
I have to absent myself for a little while.

177
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:01,916
Where are you going?

178
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:04,541
I am going to the toilet.

179
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,166
- Do you go to the toilet with your briefcase ?
- Yes, with the briefcase.

180
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:11,374
- Why?
- Just like that.

181
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:14,332
- May I?
- Please do.

182
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,749
Here you go, thanks.

183
00:11:16,457 --> 00:11:19,749
(Armando) Oh,
this one still thinks about the briefcase !

184
00:11:25,374 --> 00:11:26,916
Excuse me, do you know what time it is ?

185
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:30,791
- Are you a basketball player ?
- Yes.

186
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:33,457
It's time for you to wake up, young man.

187
00:11:37,707 --> 00:11:38,749
But who are you ?

188
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:49,666
Couldn't always be predicted
what was happening, you know ?

189
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:55,957
Do you think that when we were laying out the tracks.
40 degrees in the shade,

190
00:11:56,707 --> 00:12:02,249
the monkeys, mischievous,
From above the tree branches,

191
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:05,499
They would throw coconuts on our heads.

192
00:12:07,582 --> 00:12:10,999
There was a lot of tension
In the camp at night,

193
00:12:11,082 --> 00:12:14,707
Because we were surrounded by Indians.

194
00:12:15,957 --> 00:12:18,791
We were afraid to do things

195
00:12:18,874 --> 00:12:23,124
That were not part of their culture
and their way of life.

196
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:25,041
Fear.

197
00:12:26,332 --> 00:12:30,957
Did you know that when we built
the bridge over Rio Negro,

198
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,666
we were infested with piranhas.

199
00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:35,791
We caught an anaconda.

200
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:40,749
We opened his belly
And inside was a live monkey.

201
00:12:40,832 --> 00:12:43,207
What an extraordinary life !

202
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:47,041
I wish this journey would never end
to always listen to your stories.

203
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:51,666
Unfortunately, our journey is over,
dear young lady.

204
00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:54,791
We arrived in Bologna
and we have to prepare ourselves.

205
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:55,832
"Come on, boom."

206
00:12:56,957 --> 00:12:59,249
Eh, I have told you the whole story.

207
00:12:59,332 --> 00:13:04,249
Unfortunately, I don't know
whether I have made all the necessary notes

208
00:13:04,332 --> 00:13:05,999
to make my presentation tonight.

209
00:13:06,707 --> 00:13:07,749
Let's hope for the best.

210
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:20,249
Engineer, engineer !

211
00:13:21,082 --> 00:13:23,624
- Engineer, your umbrella, engineer !
- Who is ?

212
00:13:23,707 --> 00:13:26,541
- You forgot your umbrella.
- Oh, thank you very much.

213
00:13:26,624 --> 00:13:28,832
Where are you going ?
Are you going straight to the congress ? Where is it ?

214
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,499
It is in the Main Square,
the City Hall.

215
00:13:31,582 --> 00:13:33,874
Ah, it's near my little hotel,
The Clock.

216
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:36,124
There are no more cabs,
can I come with you ?

217
00:13:36,207 --> 00:13:38,249
Can you come ? I am already late.

218
00:13:38,332 --> 00:13:40,124
Is the Clock near the municipality ?

219
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,082
- All right, come.
- Thank you.

220
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,124
Let's go quickly, though, it's late.

221
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,124
Excuse me, Miss, if this is unlawful.

222
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:55,832
What are you doing alone in that little hotel?

223
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,582
I'll meet my fiancé
who lives in Trent.

224
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:01,916
Ah, I get it,
You meet each other halfway.

225
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:05,332
Yes, we have to decide
the date of our wedding.

226
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:08,666
If you have nothing to do,
come and have dinner with us.

227
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:11,916
Having dinner with you, are you kidding ?

228
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:14,666
Boyfriends want to be alone, don't they ?

229
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:19,916
Yes, we have been engaged for five years,
But when we are alone we get so bored.

230
00:14:20,832 --> 00:14:26,582
Hmm, but if you are so bored,
why did you decide to get married ?

231
00:14:27,832 --> 00:14:32,291
Sometimes it comes down to marriage
Just when one should break up.

232
00:14:32,374 --> 00:14:34,124
Ah, you got it !

233
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:37,957
It happens.

234
00:14:47,582 --> 00:14:48,874
We are here.

235
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:54,124
Here we are, then goodbye, young lady.

236
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,666
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

237
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:58,249
It was a very interesting trip with you.

238
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:01,207
- I we hope to meet again in Rome.
- Rome is big, miss.

239
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,624
- I don't think so.
- Never say never.

240
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:05,207
Never say never, eh.

241
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,249
However,
It was a pleasure for me as well.

242
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:09,707
I wish you all the best
for your marriage.

243
00:15:09,791 --> 00:15:11,916
Here,
Escort the young lady to the hotel.

244
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:20,624
Please be quiet.

245
00:15:21,124 --> 00:15:21,957
Thank you.

246
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:28,166
The commencement of work on the highway
is again under discussion.

247
00:15:29,374 --> 00:15:33,082
Due to the massive intervention of supporters

248
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:37,207
of the doubling of the railway line,

249
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:41,916
of which we have here in the hall
a notable representative.

250
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:45,207
Engineer Armando Andreoli.

251
00:15:47,624 --> 00:15:49,541
Silence, silence !

252
00:15:53,332 --> 00:15:56,999
(Together) Get out, go outside.

253
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:58,957
Silence !

254
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,166
(Man) And always him.

255
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:06,832
Silence, silence !

256
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:08,041
Silence !

257
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:32,332
Engineer ?

258
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,499
But...Miss, what are you doing here?

259
00:16:36,582 --> 00:16:39,499
My fiancé phoned me,
arrives tomorrow afternoon.

260
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:41,666
- I had nothing to do...
- Sit here.

261
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:44,207
- Thank you.
- Can't you see that everyone is looking at you ?

262
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:45,832
- They stopped.
- I thought.

263
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,832
they froze as soon as you entered.

264
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:50,416
I thought I would visit you
here at your convention.

265
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:53,832
Yes, you thought wrongly,
because I don't own the congress.

266
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:56,916
Everyone here is agitated, everyone is in turmoil.

267
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:59,332
Yes and no that they make me have the response.

268
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,791
(Speaker) A moment of attention,
Engineer Armando Andreoli,

269
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:05,416
author of the project
which is now in the hands of the Minister,

270
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:06,666
Will make his speech.

271
00:17:06,749 --> 00:17:07,916
Now he's calling me.

272
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:09,624
Come, engineer, come.

273
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:13,874
Go away, go away !

274
00:17:13,957 --> 00:17:15,332
What am I coming? "Come."

275
00:17:15,416 --> 00:17:16,499
Can't you hear them ?

276
00:17:16,582 --> 00:17:18,582
Please have a seat, don't worry.

277
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,416
- Engineer, go, don't be afraid.
- What did you say? Afraid?

278
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,082
I am afraid of no one.

279
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,624
Of course I'm going.

280
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,707
- Here I am, here I am ready.
- Go!

281
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,332
I obey, I obey.

282
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:36,249
- Go home.
- Enough !

283
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:40,207
- (Man) Go away, shame !
- (Man 2) Go away, shame on you!

284
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,791
(Man 3) Go back to Rome !

285
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:45,582
Go steal somewhere else !

286
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,916
When in the postwar period,

287
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:52,666
Europe found itself at a dramatic crossroads.

288
00:17:52,749 --> 00:17:55,166
of making the huge choices,

289
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:59,874
including transport on tyres
and rail transport...

290
00:18:05,957 --> 00:18:09,999
of this historic... of this historic...

291
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:15,291
of this historic concern,

292
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:20,124
I say that I have never had
neither doubts nor uncertainties.

293
00:18:20,207 --> 00:18:23,666
The are many interveners, and I see them here,

294
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:29,291
they have come here affected by bad ideas
to contest my truths.

295
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,749
Here is the evidence !

296
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:32,624
The evidence ?

297
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:36,541
The evidence is here in my speech.

298
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:39,332
Everything is here, everything is written.

299
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:45,041
My proposals
are of national interest.

300
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,624
Not of private interest !

301
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:50,957
Not of interest to your constituents

302
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:54,832
Paid to support to the last extreme
your business interests

303
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:59,582
without showing any respect
for those who disagree with you.

304
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:05,082
(Man) Enough with the lies, stop it.

305
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:12,374
(Man) Get the fuck out of here!

306
00:19:12,457 --> 00:19:15,082
- Do not respond.
- Of course I won't be responding.

307
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,666
- Because I'm leaving.
- No.

308
00:19:16,749 --> 00:19:18,957
- Yes, yes, I'm leaving.
- Please.

309
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,666
I don't want to stay
not a minute longer here.

310
00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:24,499
- Finish your presentation.
- Come on, let me through.

311
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:27,541
Don't you understand that these animals
are shouting and screaming

312
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,791
to be filmed on television?

313
00:19:29,874 --> 00:19:32,041
(Armando) I am ashamed to have come.

314
00:19:32,124 --> 00:19:34,207
For heaven's sake, 
I'm leaving, goodbye.

315
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,541
Engineer, don't give up.

316
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:39,082
- Why do you want to give them satisfaction?
- What are you saying? What do you want, too ?

317
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,707
- Let me go.
- Why do they do this ?

318
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,999
When that bastard was still in diapers,

319
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:48,082
I went to work overseas
not to bow my head to them.

320
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,457
(Armando) I am not like him, rascals!

321
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,874
(Armando) They took the bribes.
To challenge me !

322
00:19:54,957 --> 00:19:57,124
You old fart,
I would have smashed your face in.

323
00:19:57,207 --> 00:19:59,957
- What do you want to do ?
- I'll break your face.

324
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:03,832
Let's fistfight, 
I'll show you who the wrecker is.

325
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:07,041
Go back to Rome !
Go back to Rome !, go !

326
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:10,374
Do as your bosses tell you !

327
00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:13,249
Your bosses, fill the streets with cars,

328
00:20:13,332 --> 00:20:16,291
infest the air
Until we all die from poisoning.

329
00:20:16,374 --> 00:20:18,666
- He brought his geisha.
- What?

330
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:21,999
Who's geisha?
Geisha will be you, you fool.

331
00:20:22,082 --> 00:20:23,999
I work,
I'm not taking bribes like you.

332
00:20:24,082 --> 00:20:26,041
(Federica) Engineer.

333
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,499
(Man) We scared the shit out of him,
we scared him.

334
00:20:30,374 --> 00:20:34,666
The usual illiterates, scoundrels, thieves !

335
00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:38,916
Curse to me and when I joined
to this convention.

336
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:40,166
I didn't have to...

337
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,582
The briefcase, the briefcase !

338
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,082
Here it is, engineer.

339
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:48,499
Do you know that you are unpredictable ?

340
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:49,999
Thank you, miss.

341
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,582
You were very helpful to me.

342
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:56,499
I must thank you very much, Miss,
for your assistance

343
00:20:56,582 --> 00:20:59,457
this evening it was
so uncivilized and degrading.

344
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,207
you were better off with your boyfriend.

345
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,999
- No, I feel sorry for you.
- Here.

346
00:21:03,082 --> 00:21:05,999
How could anybody face
such people who were so rude?

347
00:21:06,082 --> 00:21:08,166
- Hmm.
- Are all congresses like this ?

348
00:21:08,249 --> 00:21:12,249
But no, miss, I came here
to present my project.

349
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:16,457
I knew straight away when I came,
that no one would listen to me.

350
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,624
Because they had it all planned.

351
00:21:18,707 --> 00:21:21,957
They had prepared everything
against me.

352
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,249
Do you know that you are right ?

353
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:25,999
- They didn't want to let you give your speech.
- No.

354
00:21:26,082 --> 00:21:30,707
Perhaps they were worried that you would make
a too convincing proposals.

355
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:32,999
- Rascals, delinquents.
- Where are you going?

356
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:34,166
- Uncivilized !
- Come here.

357
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:36,666
Did you see that guy?
He wanted to punch me in the face.

358
00:21:36,749 --> 00:21:39,332
- It is better to leave those people behind.
- Yes.

359
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,957
Of course,
let this evening serve as a lesson to me.

360
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:45,707
- I will never set foot here again.
You are right.

361
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,332
The most important thing now
is to go home without delay.

362
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,457
You know what I'll do, miss?

363
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:55,416
I call a cab, go to the station
and I take the first train to Rome.

364
00:21:55,499 --> 00:21:56,707
- At the station ?
- Yes.

365
00:21:56,791 --> 00:22:00,499
- Do you want to leave like this at night?
- In a way you're right.

366
00:22:00,582 --> 00:22:04,749
You know it's not acceptable here ?
I did not make reservations at any hotels.

367
00:22:04,832 --> 00:22:07,791
There is not a room
even for the price of gold.

368
00:22:07,874 --> 00:22:10,332
I have an idea, there is a small hotel nearby.

369
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,416
It is a little hotel,
surely they will find you accommodation.

370
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,624
- Really ?
- Yes.

371
00:22:14,707 --> 00:22:17,541
Are you sure that here
they won't refuse us accommodation?

372
00:22:17,624 --> 00:22:20,166
- Then you don't trust what I say.
- May I?

373
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,207
- Let me do the talking.
- YES.

374
00:22:26,207 --> 00:22:28,166
- Good evening.
- Good evening, miss.

375
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:29,832
How can I serve you in ? Good evening.

376
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,416
The gentleman cannot depart
because of the strike.

377
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:34,999
We stayed in three hotels,
But it is sold out.

378
00:22:35,082 --> 00:22:37,332
- Do you happen to have a single ?
- Look at this.

379
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,541
I don't know, there's the trade-show,
the dental conference.

380
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:42,874
Unfortunately, all the rooms are occupied.

381
00:22:42,957 --> 00:22:44,582
You don't even have a single ?

382
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:47,166
Nothing, miss,
this is a small hotel.

383
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:49,457
The rooms we have
are all booked.

384
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,541
- So.
- Wait a minute.

385
00:22:51,624 --> 00:22:54,332
this evening a french couple should arrive

386
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,624
- "Yes ?"
- "Let's try this.

387
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:59,291
If by 10 p.m. they don't show up,
the room is yours.

388
00:22:59,374 --> 00:23:01,832
- Thank you.
- Then we just have to wait.

389
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:03,999
- You can have dinner in our restaurant.
- Good.

390
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:08,332
I am sure it will be a wonderful experience
and enjoy our culinary specialities.

391
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:09,832
(Armando) That's a good idea.

392
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:13,416
(Hotelier) Forgive me, every time
there's a thunderstorm the lights goes out.

393
00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:16,707
(Hotelier) Luigi,
Escorts the guests to the restaurant.

394
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:19,249
- (Armando) Yes, let's go.
- (Federica) Let's go.

395
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:26,957
- Ah-ah, nice !
- Hmm.

396
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:28,416
Thank you.

397
00:23:30,332 --> 00:23:31,499
Leave it, I'll do it.

398
00:23:33,332 --> 00:23:35,249
- Do you ?
- Yes, I like to do that.

399
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,582
Ah, I like pork sausage.

400
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:39,957
- Do you still want one ?
- Yes.

401
00:23:40,707 --> 00:23:41,541
Thank you.

402
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,541
- Some puree.
- Yes.

403
00:23:47,332 --> 00:23:49,416
Do you like Bolognese specialities ?

404
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:50,499
I don't eat them,

405
00:23:50,582 --> 00:23:53,207
only once a year
you can even taste it.

406
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:56,166
- It's delicious, it's tasty.
- Go easy on the meat.

407
00:23:56,249 --> 00:23:58,457
It is not good for
those with  high nitrogenemia.

408
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:00,499
What do you know about high nitrogenemia ?

409
00:24:00,582 --> 00:24:02,916
I'm a nurse,
work at Holy Spirit.

410
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:04,707
Yes, I know she is a nurse,

411
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:08,374
but the fact that I have high nitrogenemia
what do you know about that?

412
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:12,374
Why did you lie to me?

413
00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:16,957
Did I lie to you? When?

414
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:18,624
On the way,

415
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,916
when you left
from the train suite,

416
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:23,832
your mobile phone rang
and I answered it.

417
00:24:23,916 --> 00:24:27,707
- And who was it ?
- It was a voice from beyond.

418
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,374
It was your wife.

419
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:34,332
My wife? What about my wife ?

420
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:36,291
Why did you say you were a widower?

421
00:24:38,582 --> 00:24:41,249
This is why?

422
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:45,499
You see, Miss, during that trip,

423
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:49,499
I was making the notes
To make the speech in Bologna.

424
00:24:49,582 --> 00:24:54,541
She would interrupt me and ask,
he would ask me, he would ask me again.

425
00:24:54,624 --> 00:24:58,124
To cut a long story short
I said I was a widower, did I do wrong ?

426
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:01,166
No, but do you always do this
with all the women you meet on the train?

427
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,124
No, don't say that.

428
00:25:03,207 --> 00:25:05,749
This is the first time
such an encounter has happened to me.

429
00:25:06,499 --> 00:25:09,416
It must be something
that was deduced by your subconscious.

430
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:11,582
What does the subconscious have to do with it?, sorry ?

431
00:25:11,666 --> 00:25:16,124
I don't know, perhaps unknowingly
you want to get rid of your wife.

432
00:25:16,207 --> 00:25:17,957
No, no.

433
00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:22,624
Ours is a marriage
that has lasted for 40 years.

434
00:25:22,707 --> 00:25:24,791
We love each other like the first day.

435
00:25:24,874 --> 00:25:27,041
Why you do not believe me?

436
00:25:27,874 --> 00:25:29,499
- If you say so, I believe you.
- I do.

437
00:25:29,582 --> 00:25:31,207
That's it.

438
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:33,916
Here it is.

439
00:25:34,832 --> 00:25:35,874
It's here.

440
00:25:35,957 --> 00:25:38,499
Gentlemen, I'm sorry,
right now...

441
00:25:38,582 --> 00:25:41,124
- I heard, the French have arrived.
- Correct.

442
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,541
- So ?
- The room is no longer available.

443
00:25:43,624 --> 00:25:45,666
Don't you have something to accommodate me ?

444
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:48,624
- An armchair, a chair?
- I am terribly sorry, sir.

445
00:25:48,707 --> 00:25:51,541
- I can only offer you a couch.
- Very good.

446
00:25:51,624 --> 00:25:54,624
- Perfect.
- What a couch! He'll sleep in the room with me.

447
00:25:54,707 --> 00:25:56,582
No, no, let it be.

448
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:58,207
If the young lady agrees.

449
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:01,707
No bother, I have a big bed,
We will not bother each other.

450
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:03,999
No, no, no,
The couch is fine with me.

451
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:06,499
No, no way,
he sleeps in the room with me.

452
00:26:06,582 --> 00:26:07,374
(Armando) Ah.

453
00:26:07,457 --> 00:26:09,791
If the young lady agrees,
I would take advantage of it.

454
00:26:09,874 --> 00:26:11,332
- Well.
- Do you have any identification?

455
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:13,374
- Yes.
- Thank you.

456
00:26:13,457 --> 00:26:14,832
- I have my passport.
- Thank you.

457
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:16,332
- Good night.
- Good night.

458
00:26:16,416 --> 00:26:17,207
Good night.

459
00:26:19,374 --> 00:26:24,666
Excuse me, do you realise
what you say and what you do?

460
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:28,499
- I always know what I am doing.
- Yes ?

461
00:26:28,582 --> 00:26:32,082
Yes, what? No, I'm fine now.

462
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:35,791
(Armando) I have a warm bed,
a warm quilt, I'm really comfortable.

463
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:37,874
Are you going to Africa with the Red Cross?

464
00:26:37,957 --> 00:26:39,749
No, no, give up, look.

465
00:26:40,707 --> 00:26:44,166
No, it's fine, we'll talk about it,
I'll be home for breakfast tomorrow anyway.

466
00:26:44,707 --> 00:26:47,541
Is that alright?
Bye, Alessandra, good night.

467
00:26:47,624 --> 00:26:48,791
Good night, dear.

468
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,666
- Thank you, Federica.
- You're welcome.

469
00:26:54,582 --> 00:26:56,374
Why is your wife going to Africa?

470
00:26:56,457 --> 00:27:01,999
Ah, she has been
involved in aid to the Third World,

471
00:27:02,082 --> 00:27:03,249
for the Red Cross.

472
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:06,166
How come you didn't tell her
that you were in the room with me?

473
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:11,249
Well, these things you 
don't say over the phone,

474
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:12,957
because it can be misunderstood.

475
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:13,957
you're is right.

476
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:17,207
- Are you comfortable in the bed?
- Ah.

477
00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:22,124
- How grateful I am to you!
- Are you sure you're alright?

478
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,499
I heard you say
that your head was cold.

479
00:27:24,582 --> 00:27:27,582
Well, because there was
so much rain today!

480
00:27:28,707 --> 00:27:30,291
My head is freezing.

481
00:27:30,374 --> 00:27:31,957
Look under the pillow.

482
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:34,874
- Under the pillow ?
- Yes.

483
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:36,749
What ?

484
00:27:38,082 --> 00:27:39,166
Oh there.

485
00:27:40,082 --> 00:27:42,082
- What a beautiful nightcap !
- Do you like it ?

486
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,999
Beautiful, is it yours ?

487
00:27:44,082 --> 00:27:45,999
No, it was a surprise for my fiancé.

488
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:47,582
- Ah-
- But you can wear it now.

489
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,749
Eh, no, that's not proper.

490
00:27:49,832 --> 00:27:52,874
What do you care?
Put it on, he didn't come anyway.

491
00:27:52,957 --> 00:27:54,332
- Really?
- Yes.

492
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:55,291
Well, you know what ?

493
00:27:55,374 --> 00:27:58,291
I feel sorry for your fiancé,
I'm really going to wear it.

494
00:27:58,374 --> 00:28:00,416
- Ahh  !
- It looks great on you.

495
00:28:00,499 --> 00:28:02,082
- Do I look good?
- Yes.

496
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,124
- It looks really good on you.
- Nice, warm.

497
00:28:04,207 --> 00:28:07,749
Well, it suits you just fine,
but you're fine with everything.

498
00:28:08,707 --> 00:28:11,082
You'll wear it with a lot of distinction.

499
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:12,999
- Really ?
- Yes.

500
00:28:14,541 --> 00:28:16,707
You have beautiful blue eyes.

501
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:18,166
I hadn't noticed.

502
00:28:19,082 --> 00:28:21,291
Actually, I hadn't noticed it either.

503
00:28:25,207 --> 00:28:28,374
Oh, God, it's already 11 p.m.
and the lights still haven't come back on.

504
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,374
Yeah, and we can't watch
the television either.

505
00:28:31,457 --> 00:28:33,457
That's better, so we can talk a little.

506
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:38,082
Yes, it's better, but I was saying that
because TV helps me sleep.

507
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,624
Every time I see television
I fall asleep.

508
00:28:40,707 --> 00:28:41,916
Can't sleep ?

509
00:28:43,499 --> 00:28:45,957
Yes, yes, I sleep well, all right.

510
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:49,124
Would you like me to read you a good poem?

511
00:28:49,207 --> 00:28:51,457
- Ah, poetry ?
- YES.

512
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:56,457
- I like poems so much, I love them.
- I always read them in the hospital to patients.

513
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:58,332
They are as happy as children.

514
00:28:58,416 --> 00:29:00,207
- Yes, really ?
- Yes, they like it.

515
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:03,124
- Ah, read it to me, what is it ?
- Do you like Prévert ?

516
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:07,749
Prévert is my favourite author,
his love poems are exquisite.

517
00:29:07,832 --> 00:29:10,916
(Armando) A beautiful poem,
what a beautiful idea!

518
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,124
- "When."
- "When."

519
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:18,791
"When the little lion has breakfast,
the lioness becomes young again."

520
00:29:20,374 --> 00:29:24,582
"When fire claims its share,
the earth blazes."

521
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:30,124
"When death speaks to her of love,
life quivers."

522
00:29:31,124 --> 00:29:35,957
"When life speaks to it of death,
love has a smile."

523
00:29:38,832 --> 00:29:40,332
What is he doing, sleeping ?

524
00:31:12,457 --> 00:31:15,207
- Need anything else?
- No, thank you very much.

525
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:18,291
Federica, breakfast has arrived.

526
00:31:18,374 --> 00:31:21,832
- Finished showering?
- (Federica) I'll be right there.

527
00:31:22,666 --> 00:31:24,457
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you.

528
00:31:25,124 --> 00:31:27,166
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, you're welcome.

529
00:31:27,249 --> 00:31:29,874
- Did you make a mistake?
- Did I make a mistake?

530
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:32,166
You made a mistake, this is my room.

531
00:31:32,249 --> 00:31:34,291
Isn't this room 223 ?

532
00:31:34,374 --> 00:31:36,582
Yes, it's 223.

533
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:40,082
- This is not the one you were looking for.
- How is it not mine?

534
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:42,916
I booked this room
in my fiancée's name,

535
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:44,749
Ms. Federica Pescatore.

536
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:48,624
Do you know you are right ?

537
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:51,749
This is the room
Of Ms. Federica Pescatore.

538
00:31:51,832 --> 00:31:53,166
So what are you doing here?

539
00:31:53,249 --> 00:31:54,166
What am I doing here?

540
00:31:54,249 --> 00:31:55,207
Yes, what are you doing here?

541
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:56,874
No, I am not doing anything here.

542
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:58,916
It is as if I were not here.

543
00:31:59,457 --> 00:32:01,249
It's a pure coincidence, that I am here.

544
00:32:01,332 --> 00:32:05,541
- (Federica) Engineer, who are you talking to?
- To your fiancé.

545
00:32:07,582 --> 00:32:08,416
Ah.

546
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:09,291
Um.

547
00:32:10,207 --> 00:32:12,499
Hi, weren't you supposed to arrive in the afternoon ?

548
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:14,499
Never mind when I was supposed to arrive.

549
00:32:14,582 --> 00:32:17,874
Rather you, explain to me what you are doing
in bed with this gentleman.

550
00:32:17,957 --> 00:32:20,624
I mean, you arrive so suddenly
and you raise your voice?

551
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:22,374
Do you want to make out that it's my fault too now ?

552
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:25,457
(Armando) Listen, sir,
don't get any wrong ideas,

553
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:28,457
because I could also sleep
In an armchair.

554
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:32,249
It was the generosity of the young lady
who told me:

555
00:32:32,332 --> 00:32:35,832
"No, you sleep in my bed",
but that was because it was me.

556
00:32:35,916 --> 00:32:39,249
Excuse me, take a good look at my face.

557
00:32:40,624 --> 00:32:42,832
I am closer to 80 than 70.

558
00:32:42,916 --> 00:32:45,541
What does it matter, what are you saying ?
What does age matter?

559
00:32:45,624 --> 00:32:47,749
Look, Miss Federica,

560
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:51,749
perhaps you can better explain to the gentleman
how things went.

561
00:32:51,832 --> 00:32:55,457
That's it, anyway,
now I'll get dressed right away.

562
00:32:55,541 --> 00:32:58,374
Don't worry,
and then I'll also leave in a flash

563
00:32:58,457 --> 00:33:00,624
Here, I'll get my briefcase.

564
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:02,499
Pardon.

565
00:33:03,332 --> 00:33:06,291
You must tell me who it is! But who is this?

566
00:33:10,124 --> 00:33:12,541
Meanwhile, this is a gentleman.

567
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:14,124
In fact, he is a great gentleman.

568
00:33:15,082 --> 00:33:17,707
If you really want to know,
Is a famous engineer.

569
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:20,291
He is a designer of steam locomotives.

570
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,374
Here I am.

571
00:33:23,041 --> 00:33:24,624
I was very fast.

572
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:28,207
I want to take my troubles from you.

573
00:33:28,291 --> 00:33:32,457
To you, young lady, I want to express
all my gratitude

574
00:33:32,541 --> 00:33:34,166
for your generous hospitality.

575
00:33:35,874 --> 00:33:37,082
Sorry to have disturbed you.

576
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:40,249
What disturbance, engineer ?
It was a great pleasure.

577
00:33:41,082 --> 00:33:44,082
- (Federica) Aren't you going to answer?
- (Giorgio) Do I have to answer as well?

578
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:47,791
(Giorgio) Federica, I am used
to the fact that you are unpredictable.

579
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:50,207
(Federica) This is the way I am,
take it or leave it.

580
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:52,124
(Federica) Leave me !

581
00:34:09,957 --> 00:34:12,874
La 231, accompany the gentlemen to the room.

582
00:34:12,957 --> 00:34:13,749
This is perfectly fine.

583
00:34:13,832 --> 00:34:15,957
- Oh, good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

584
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:16,999
Did you sleep well?

585
00:34:17,082 --> 00:34:20,666
Well, never mind,
let's say I slept.

586
00:34:20,749 --> 00:34:23,249
Rather, how much do I owe you for the room ?

587
00:34:23,332 --> 00:34:25,791
Nothing, sir,
you are a guest of the young lady.

588
00:34:25,874 --> 00:34:27,707
- Yes?
- It's all on the boyfriend's account.

589
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:28,957
- Really ?
- Eh-

590
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:29,957
Ah, well.

591
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,332
- So.
- here is your passport.

592
00:34:32,416 --> 00:34:34,457
Thank you, this is for you.

593
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:36,957
- Thank you, sir, have a good trip.
- Thank you.

594
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,999
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, sir.

595
00:34:40,499 --> 00:34:41,457
Let's all hope for the best.

596
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:43,624
Hopefully.

597
00:34:51,457 --> 00:34:55,166
- (Hotelier) Hotel Orologio.
- Listen, porter.

598
00:34:55,249 --> 00:34:58,207
I am that gentleman
who stayed overnight in your hotel

599
00:34:58,291 --> 00:35:01,291
in the room
of Miss Federica Pescatore.

600
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:04,082
Yes, sir, did you forget something ?

601
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:07,624
No, I wanted information.

602
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:11,082
After my departure what happened ?

603
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:13,499
All quiet,
sir, don't worry.

604
00:35:13,582 --> 00:35:14,374
Ah.

605
00:35:15,124 --> 00:35:18,499
Do you already know Miss Pescatore?

606
00:35:18,582 --> 00:35:19,832
Is she a client of yours ?

607
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:22,124
No, it was the first time
she was sleeping over.

608
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:22,999
Ah.

609
00:35:23,874 --> 00:35:28,332
Um, tell me, concierge, in confidence,

610
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:32,582
her behaviour
don't you find it a bit equivocal?

611
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:34,832
You should know better, sir.

612
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:38,291
No, because my suspicions are...

613
00:35:38,374 --> 00:35:43,416
This sudden arrival of the boyfriend,
you know, I wouldn't want them to disagree.

614
00:35:43,499 --> 00:35:45,416
Did they try to extort you?

615
00:35:45,499 --> 00:35:46,624
No, no.

616
00:35:48,374 --> 00:35:49,624
Not exactly extortion,

617
00:35:49,707 --> 00:35:53,666
but if the young lady
asks her for my address,

618
00:35:54,374 --> 00:35:56,874
you say
that you are not authorised to give it to her.

619
00:35:56,957 --> 00:35:59,082
- All right, sir.
- All right.

620
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:01,291
 I thank you
for your generous tip.

621
00:36:01,374 --> 00:36:03,791
- Have a good trip.
- Not at all, thank you.

622
00:36:03,874 --> 00:36:05,124
Take care, eh.

623
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,416
Heh, oh.

624
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:12,541
That...

625
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:18,291
Some intention was there.

626
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:27,791
- Thank you.
- Welcome back, engineer.

627
00:36:27,874 --> 00:36:28,749
(Armando) Here.

628
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,791
- Here.
- Thank you.

629
00:36:35,874 --> 00:36:39,124
- Yesterday we waited for you all evening.
- I know, I had to stay.

630
00:36:39,207 --> 00:36:41,707
- My wife?
- And upstairs, she's working with the Countess.

631
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:44,791
Erm, the little crusaders
and the black gentleman, as usual.

632
00:36:53,082 --> 00:36:56,707
- (Luisita) Good morning, engineer.
- Hello, Luisita, everything OK here?

633
00:36:56,791 --> 00:36:59,832
Here is the Italian Red Cross in action.

634
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:02,166
- How are you doing ?
- Good, thank you.

635
00:37:02,249 --> 00:37:04,457
- Oh, John.
- Good morning, engineer.

636
00:37:04,541 --> 00:37:06,916
Sorry we invaded your house today.

637
00:37:06,999 --> 00:37:09,624
- We had an expedition.
- For goodness sake, it is your job.

638
00:37:09,707 --> 00:37:11,582
Do your work, where is my wife ?

639
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:13,666
- She's over there with the Countess.
- Good.

640
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:23,582
Hey there, guess what ?
It's me, here I am !

641
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:27,082
- No one can understand...
- Alessandra, I'm back.

642
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:30,332
An incredible journey,
an adventure I must tell you about.

643
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:31,457
- AFTER-
- After ?

644
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:34,749
- I finish the call and I'm all yours.
- After that, do whatever you want.

645
00:37:34,832 --> 00:37:37,416
- Hello? Hello?
- Go, dear.

646
00:37:37,499 --> 00:37:38,957
(Alessandra) Consul ?

647
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:41,207
(Armando) Here we go.

648
00:37:41,291 --> 00:37:43,082
- Everything done ?
- Excuse us, engineer.

649
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:46,041
Make yourselves at home,
for goodness sake.

650
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:51,291
- (Armando) By now.
- Engineer, lunch is ready.

651
00:37:51,374 --> 00:37:54,832
I'm really hungry,
but the lady hasn't finished yet.

652
00:37:54,916 --> 00:37:56,041
Now, in a little while...

653
00:38:00,082 --> 00:38:03,082
I was expecting it yesterday
And instead it only arrived this morning.

654
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:06,291
He says he has so much to tell me,
Who knows what it will be ?

655
00:38:06,374 --> 00:38:08,582
- (Contessa) Everything is ready here.
- Goodbye.

656
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:09,582
- Hello.
- Hello.

657
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,416
Luisita ?

658
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,666
- (John) Ma'am.
- Yes ?

659
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:17,249
I'll pick you up tomorrow
with the Consulate's car.

660
00:38:17,332 --> 00:38:18,291
(Alessandra) Perfect.

661
00:38:18,374 --> 00:38:21,166
- The engineer is waiting for you.
- Luisita, accompany the gentlemen.

662
00:38:22,499 --> 00:38:23,332
Armando ?

663
00:38:24,332 --> 00:38:26,416
(Armando) I couldn't wait.
to return home

664
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:30,332
to tell you about this adventure,
it's an incredible thing!

665
00:38:31,374 --> 00:38:33,499
At the station she calls me: " Papa."

666
00:38:34,832 --> 00:38:38,041
Inside the train
she enters my private suite,

667
00:38:38,124 --> 00:38:42,124
giving up the company
of basketball players, oh!

668
00:38:42,207 --> 00:38:45,791
She says: "But they are boring,
I prefer to be with you."

669
00:38:45,874 --> 00:38:47,916
Tell me, but what is she like? What is she like?

670
00:38:47,999 --> 00:38:49,874
Ah, she's beautiful.

671
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,749
She is very beautiful.

672
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:55,749
She works as a nurse
at the Hospital of the Holy Spirit.

673
00:38:56,916 --> 00:38:58,957
She says she is enrolled at the university,

674
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:02,791
but I think this girl
to supplement her salary...

675
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:05,624
Ah, but then this is a long story.

676
00:39:05,707 --> 00:39:07,916
- Very long.
- It feels like an adventure novel.

677
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:09,874
Let's go over there and have a drink, come on.

678
00:39:09,957 --> 00:39:13,499
While you finish telling me,
I'm waiting for the phone call.

679
00:39:13,582 --> 00:39:16,416
I couldn't wait to come back
to tell you about it.

680
00:39:16,499 --> 00:39:19,291
More than just long! Just listen.

681
00:39:19,374 --> 00:39:22,124
During the whole journey back,
I said:

682
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:25,124
" Now that I'm going to tell Alessandra..."

683
00:39:25,207 --> 00:39:28,166
- "Love, can I have my usual drink?
- Yes.

684
00:39:29,374 --> 00:39:31,707
This happened because I was forced

685
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:32,916
to stay in Bologna.

686
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:36,124
- Yeah.
- There was the storm, there was the strike.

687
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,457
I looked for a room.

688
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:41,124
All the hotels were full,
there was not a single vacant room.

689
00:39:41,207 --> 00:39:44,249
I found one from a French dentist.

690
00:39:44,332 --> 00:39:46,707
If they didn't come, they'd give it to me.

691
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:50,874
Instead, at that moment at the most beautiful
the French dentist arrived.

692
00:39:50,957 --> 00:39:54,707
The director came to me and said:
"Look, the room is occupied."

693
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:56,249
"I can give you a couch."

694
00:39:56,332 --> 00:39:59,707
"A couch ?" she said,
"Are you crazy ?"

695
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:01,457
"He's sleeping with me."

696
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:04,457
Well, she was very nice this girl.

697
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:07,207
Yes, yes, she was very nice.

698
00:40:08,207 --> 00:40:10,624
But did you understand
what I told you ?

699
00:40:10,707 --> 00:40:11,999
Of course I understood.

700
00:40:12,082 --> 00:40:16,207
Well, I slept with her,
I slept the whole night with her.

701
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,499
Armando, I understand.

702
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,582
- I got it !
- As long as you understand.

703
00:40:21,666 --> 00:40:24,457
Eh, I didn't even want to tell you.

704
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:27,749
I said: "Alessandra is going to get jealous."

705
00:40:27,832 --> 00:40:29,374
- My love...
- No, eh ?

706
00:40:29,457 --> 00:40:30,666
- Jealousy ?
- No.

707
00:40:30,749 --> 00:40:33,916
After so many years I know you too well.

708
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:36,832
So, listen,
right now I really have

709
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:39,916
some very big worries
to think about.

710
00:40:39,999 --> 00:40:41,832
So excuse me.

711
00:40:41,916 --> 00:40:45,082
- Look, I put on my pyjamas....
- Shh.

712
00:40:45,166 --> 00:40:47,291
(Armando) Ah...

713
00:40:47,957 --> 00:40:48,791
Hello ?

714
00:40:49,374 --> 00:40:51,291
Oh, it's you at last.

715
00:40:51,374 --> 00:40:53,499
I've been waiting for hours for you.

716
00:40:53,582 --> 00:40:55,166
Yes.

717
00:40:55,249 --> 00:40:59,249
I wanted to tell you that I checked
the whole list of antibiotics.

718
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,166
They're all expired.

719
00:41:01,249 --> 00:41:05,666
A disgrace, believe me,
a great shame!

720
00:41:05,749 --> 00:41:07,832
- (Armando) Alessandra, Alessandra ?
- No, no.

721
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:12,082
(Alessandra) For the rest
we are quite covered,

722
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:14,207
I mean, the other medicines are there.

723
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:16,124
It is late, I almost.

724
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,416
- (Alessandra) Hmm.
- Huh ?

725
00:41:17,499 --> 00:41:19,166
- Yes.
- Yes.

726
00:41:19,249 --> 00:41:21,874
- Yes.
- Yes, No, for the medicines...

727
00:41:21,957 --> 00:41:24,832
If not let's make it daytime,
I know these phone calls.

728
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:28,582
I received a fax from Milan
which I will now read it to you.

729
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:31,832
You guarantee us
the sending of the following vaccines.

730
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:33,166
- Just a moment.
- YES.

731
00:41:33,249 --> 00:41:34,041
So.

732
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:39,082
I'm going to the bedroom,
it's not over yet, you'll see.

733
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:42,041
"Cholera, malaria, typhoid..."

734
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:54,791
(Armando) No, on that side there
no temptation.

735
00:41:54,874 --> 00:41:56,332
(Priest) Not even with the thought?

736
00:41:57,041 --> 00:41:59,832
Eh, with the thought, you know.

737
00:42:00,707 --> 00:42:03,999
Because it's so sudden,

738
00:42:04,082 --> 00:42:08,749
perhaps driven
more by curiosity than anything else, that is.

739
00:42:09,957 --> 00:42:14,499
After all, it's been so long
that I no longer have any stimuli, I have no reactions.

740
00:42:15,124 --> 00:42:16,374
Not even with my wife.

741
00:42:16,457 --> 00:42:18,749
So much so
That we sleep in separate rooms.

742
00:42:18,832 --> 00:42:22,041
- Meanwhile, this is not your wife.
- Eh-

743
00:42:22,124 --> 00:42:23,957
Did you ever meet that girl again?

744
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,916
No, no.

745
00:42:26,707 --> 00:42:31,957
You see, it doesn't seem to me that your adventure
contains anything shameful.

746
00:42:32,624 --> 00:42:36,916
I am rather concerned
that you still think about it, huh?

747
00:42:37,499 --> 00:42:38,874
You may go.

748
00:42:39,582 --> 00:42:42,874
(Priest) Should you find yourself again
in similar situations again,

749
00:42:42,957 --> 00:42:45,332
always think of your wife.

750
00:42:45,416 --> 00:42:49,166
- Do not doubt, Father.
- Praised be Jesus Christ.

751
00:42:49,249 --> 00:42:50,499
Behold, praise be to jesus.

752
00:42:51,166 --> 00:42:53,541
All right, Velardi, now I'll tell you everything.

753
00:42:53,624 --> 00:42:56,666
- In the meantime, have a drink.
- No, I'll help myself.

754
00:42:56,749 --> 00:42:58,499
I want plenty of vodka.

755
00:42:59,541 --> 00:43:00,499
Do you think so ?

756
00:43:00,582 --> 00:43:02,874
Have you heard from our doctor ?

757
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:04,291
He serves himself.

758
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:08,999
We forbid everything; he eats instead,
He drinks and smokes like a Turk.

759
00:43:09,082 --> 00:43:11,249
I am a doctor, not a sick person.

760
00:43:11,332 --> 00:43:13,582
- Am I right, Mary?
- How clever.

761
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:17,707
- Is there a tournament ?
- Eh, yes.

762
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:22,832
- Hello? Yes, he's here.
- He has not told you.

763
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:26,832
I'll put him on right away. Engineer, it's for you.

764
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:29,124
- Who is ?
- Ms. Federica.

765
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:31,124
Another one like that, though...

766
00:43:31,207 --> 00:43:32,916
- It's Federica, what shall I tell her?
- Well?

767
00:43:32,999 --> 00:43:35,957
- Tell her I'm not here.
- I said you're here.

768
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:37,832
- What are you afraid of?
- Eh!

769
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:39,624
- Answer.
- Come on.

770
00:43:43,416 --> 00:43:45,332
- Hello ?
- It's Federica.

771
00:43:45,416 --> 00:43:46,999
Ah, Miss Federica.

772
00:43:47,749 --> 00:43:51,374
I thought you wouldn't be in touch any more,
it's been a while.

773
00:43:51,457 --> 00:43:53,041
How come? You found me, huh?

774
00:43:53,124 --> 00:43:54,916
- I found you.
- Yes.

775
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:58,207
- What are you doing, engineer?
- What am I doing?

776
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:01,082
Well, I'm at home with friends.

777
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:05,041
- You?
- What floor do you live on?

778
00:44:06,249 --> 00:44:09,957
I live on the first floor, why?

779
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:12,457
Ah, yes, I can see the lights in the windows.

780
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:13,999
- Yes ?
- Yes,.

781
00:44:14,082 --> 00:44:17,124
What, you see the windows?
Why, where are you calling from?

782
00:44:17,207 --> 00:44:19,416
I'm down here, in front of your house.

783
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:23,707
- Alessandra, she's down below.
- then have her come up.

784
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:26,707
- What, have her come up here?
- Eh.

785
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:27,582
But no!

786
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,999
(Armando) Excuse me, Miss,
why are you calling me from down there?

787
00:44:32,082 --> 00:44:33,291
I'm just passing by.

788
00:44:33,374 --> 00:44:35,582
I'm on my way to the hospital
for the night shift.

789
00:44:35,666 --> 00:44:39,791
Ah, well, then good work
and thanks for the call.

790
00:44:39,874 --> 00:44:41,166
Goodbye, Miss.

791
00:44:41,249 --> 00:44:42,332
No, wait a minute.

792
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:44,624
I am free tomorrow,
we could meet up.

793
00:44:44,707 --> 00:44:47,291
Tomorrow?
Look, Miss, I have a lot to do.

794
00:44:47,374 --> 00:44:48,707
Why do I have to see you?

795
00:44:48,791 --> 00:44:52,457
- I have something very important to tell you.
- I cannot come.

796
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:55,124
- Armando, Armando.
- What is it?

797
00:44:55,207 --> 00:44:58,124
Don't make it so long,
give her an appointment, no?

798
00:44:58,207 --> 00:44:58,999
Hmm.

799
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:05,707
Miss,
if this is very important,

800
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:07,374
OK, let's meet.

801
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:09,374
Where can we meet ?

802
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,374
Come tomorrow to my house at three o'clock.

803
00:45:11,457 --> 00:45:14,374
Ring the intercom, Via degli Ausoni, 7.

804
00:45:14,457 --> 00:45:16,624
But is it your name on the intercom?

805
00:45:16,707 --> 00:45:19,082
No, it says: "Tango School."

806
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:21,791
- School of...?
- Tango.

807
00:45:21,874 --> 00:45:23,124
- Tango ?
- Yes.

808
00:45:23,207 --> 00:45:24,666
(Armando) What is it?

809
00:45:24,749 --> 00:45:27,624
Don't ask too many questions,
I will explain tomorrow.

810
00:45:27,707 --> 00:45:30,832
All right, Miss,
at 3 o'clock I'll be at your house.

811
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:31,999
Goodbye.

812
00:45:32,082 --> 00:45:32,916
Goodbye.

813
00:45:34,749 --> 00:45:36,707
"Tango school," she says.

814
00:45:37,499 --> 00:45:38,791
Crazy things.

815
00:45:38,874 --> 00:45:42,666
Does it seem to you that a man of my age
goes to tango school?

816
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:49,999
Here.

817
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,207
(Armando) "Tango School."

818
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:09,999
She said, "You ring the intercom,
but no one answering.

819
00:46:10,082 --> 00:46:11,749
What is this, a freight elevator?

820
00:46:17,291 --> 00:46:18,749
(Armando) Oh, here we go.

821
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:31,749
- Hello.
- Good morning.

822
00:46:31,832 --> 00:46:32,707
Good morning.

823
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:34,624
Does Miss Federica live here?

824
00:46:34,707 --> 00:46:36,541
Yes, are you Federica's papà ?

825
00:46:36,624 --> 00:46:38,332
No, I am not her papà.

826
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:41,082
- I am Engineer Andreoli.
- The engineer.

827
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:43,374
- Come in.
- Oh, thank you.

828
00:46:43,916 --> 00:46:45,957
- What a pleasure.
- (Armando) Yes.

829
00:46:46,749 --> 00:46:51,416
- (Armando) Federica is always talking about you.
- Really? Where is Federica ?

830
00:46:51,499 --> 00:46:55,999
She just woke up because she did
night shift at the hospital.

831
00:46:56,082 --> 00:46:58,374
- Ah.
- Vega, come in, give me your coat.

832
00:46:58,457 --> 00:47:00,207
No, no, I'd rather keep it.

833
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:02,832
"One, two, three"

834
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:07,499
Excuse me, does Federica sleep here
in the tango school?

835
00:47:07,582 --> 00:47:09,457
Yes, we sleep upstairs.

836
00:47:10,457 --> 00:47:14,374
We share the flat with three girls
to save on rent.

837
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:18,416
This is Mercedes, she's from Argentina,
she gives tango lessons here.

838
00:47:18,499 --> 00:47:22,457
Bend your knee,
you have to feel my body, that's good.

839
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:25,249
Mercedes, the engineer has arrived.

840
00:47:25,332 --> 00:47:27,707
Oh, engineer, finally.

841
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:29,374
Good morning, engineer.

842
00:47:29,457 --> 00:47:31,749
- Pleased to meet you.
- Please, have a seat.

843
00:47:31,832 --> 00:47:34,416
- Thank you.
- (Mercedes) Here, pay no attention to it.

844
00:47:34,499 --> 00:47:36,624
(Armando) No, I'm waiting for Federica.

845
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:39,499
No, it is broken.

846
00:47:39,582 --> 00:47:42,124
- No, it's fine.
- Gloria, take that chair away.

847
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:43,791
- I'm so sorry.
- She told me that later.

848
00:47:43,874 --> 00:47:46,166
- You're right.
- Sit here, so sorry.

849
00:47:46,249 --> 00:47:48,791
It is nothing, nothing at all.

850
00:47:48,874 --> 00:47:50,041
Like this.

851
00:47:51,624 --> 00:47:54,666
- (Mercedes) Do you like tango ?
- (Armando) Do I like it ?

852
00:47:54,749 --> 00:48:00,499
I'll tell you, back in the day,
in all modesty I was a great dancer.

853
00:48:00,582 --> 00:48:03,374
Today, you know, they don't do such dances any more.

854
00:48:03,457 --> 00:48:05,374
Today they are dancing to rock.

855
00:48:05,457 --> 00:48:09,041
- Yes, it's true, young people are dancing to rock.
- "What the hell!"

856
00:48:09,832 --> 00:48:11,541
Not doing exercise anymore,

857
00:48:11,624 --> 00:48:15,374
venting their emotions by jumping around,
moving to the rhythm of rock.

858
00:48:15,457 --> 00:48:17,832
- Unfortunately.
- But nothing to do with tango.

859
00:48:17,916 --> 00:48:20,999
- Rock is puritanical.
- Puritanical, why?

860
00:48:21,082 --> 00:48:23,541
Because the man and the woman
they dance separately.

861
00:48:23,624 --> 00:48:26,041
- Oh, yeah.
- Tango is much more sensual.

862
00:48:26,832 --> 00:48:27,666
Yep.

863
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:32,082
I don't quite grasp the concept,
what do you mean?

864
00:48:32,166 --> 00:48:34,457
I mean that in the tango
there is physical contact,

865
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:37,207
the man and the woman
always remain close.

866
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:40,874
(Mercedes) He feels her body,
she feels his body.

867
00:48:40,957 --> 00:48:42,916
(Mercedes) It is a carnal relationship.

868
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:45,874
She teaches him
that sensual love and death

869
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:47,832
always go together.

870
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:48,707
Ah.

871
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:52,916
Sorry, but I had never made
any of those thoughts.

872
00:48:53,582 --> 00:48:55,707
I'm saying this against my own interests, though.

873
00:48:55,791 --> 00:48:57,666
Sensuality cannot be learned in school.

874
00:48:57,749 --> 00:49:00,166
- One has to be born with this gift.
- Not that one.

875
00:49:00,249 --> 00:49:03,416
- Like Federica, for example.
- Why does Federica also...?

876
00:49:03,499 --> 00:49:06,749
Yes, she helps me when she can,
she pairs up with my students.

877
00:49:06,832 --> 00:49:08,874
- You should see her.
- I can imagine.

878
00:49:08,957 --> 00:49:11,457
- No, you can't imagine it.
- Of course not!

879
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:12,374
There she is.

880
00:49:15,874 --> 00:49:17,374
- There he is.
- Oh there.

881
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:19,082
Federica, look who's here ?

882
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:21,207
Sorry to keep you waiting.

883
00:49:24,999 --> 00:49:27,999
Federica, I'll give you back your engineer,
he is very nice.

884
00:49:28,082 --> 00:49:30,749
- I know. Good morning, engineer.
- Good morning, Federica.

885
00:49:30,832 --> 00:49:33,374
- Show him how you dance the tango.
- No, another day.

886
00:49:33,457 --> 00:49:35,124
- We don't have time today, do we?
- No ?

887
00:49:35,207 --> 00:49:36,749
- "Adios."
- "Adios, Senorita ."

888
00:49:36,832 --> 00:49:37,624
Where are we going ?

889
00:49:37,707 --> 00:49:39,791
We can stay here,
so we can dance the tango.

890
00:49:39,874 --> 00:49:41,874
- No, let's go somewhere quieter.
- Yes?

891
00:49:41,957 --> 00:49:45,582
We must be alone,
I have something very important to tell you.

892
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:48,624
He told me: "If you have been
all night in bed together"

893
00:49:48,707 --> 00:49:51,916
"and he didn't try,
then your engineer is an asshole."

894
00:49:51,999 --> 00:49:54,791
No, "asshole" ? Now let's take it easy.

895
00:49:55,874 --> 00:49:58,041
Let's just say I'm a decent person.

896
00:49:58,124 --> 00:50:00,666
You can see that for him
makes no difference.

897
00:50:00,749 --> 00:50:01,874
Of course, he is young.

898
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,999
Some young people talk like that,

899
00:50:04,082 --> 00:50:07,166
but when they have reached my age
then they will understand.

900
00:50:07,249 --> 00:50:08,166
But no!

901
00:50:08,249 --> 00:50:11,791
He says in these cases
age has nothing to do with it.

902
00:50:11,874 --> 00:50:13,457
I agree with him.

903
00:50:14,416 --> 00:50:16,332
Excuse me?

904
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:17,874
And you agree with him?

905
00:50:17,957 --> 00:50:21,999
Yes, if you let me talk,
I want to explain to you that age

906
00:50:22,082 --> 00:50:25,041
is an irrelevant factor
in romantic relationships.

907
00:50:25,124 --> 00:50:27,707
But how is it irrelevant? Come on, now!

908
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:31,166
You're telling me ?
To a man of my experience ?

909
00:50:31,249 --> 00:50:32,916
But if you always interrupt me !

910
00:50:32,999 --> 00:50:35,957
Am I interrupting you?
You're interrupting me, sorry.

911
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:38,957
Instead you have to listen to me
because you don't understand.

912
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:41,166
- I don't know what?
- you don't know.

913
00:50:41,249 --> 00:50:44,499
 He doesn't know that if a man my age,

914
00:50:44,582 --> 00:50:48,457
suppose he is in bed with a woman,

915
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:52,374
also the most beautiful in the world,
the most attractive, the most exciting,

916
00:50:53,082 --> 00:50:56,457
he lets her go
because he is afraid to attempt the encounter,

917
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:58,874
because he understands that she has her own troubles.

918
00:50:58,957 --> 00:51:02,291
Did you or did you not understand
what I mean?

919
00:51:02,374 --> 00:51:03,707
- I understand, I understand.
- Oh!

920
00:51:03,791 --> 00:51:05,082
I'm not dumb !

921
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:09,082
- Then why do you say it's not true?
- Well, my fiancé didn't believe it.

922
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,957
He made a scene
And screwed up the wedding.

923
00:51:12,041 --> 00:51:14,291
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.

924
00:51:14,916 --> 00:51:17,082
Do you understand why
I wanted to see you urgently ?

925
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:19,999
Yes, I understand, it's serious.

926
00:51:20,707 --> 00:51:21,541
But.

927
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:23,666
Excuse me, Miss,

928
00:51:23,749 --> 00:51:26,207
why did you have to say it so urgently
me?

929
00:51:26,874 --> 00:51:28,166
Who was I supposed to tell ?

930
00:51:28,249 --> 00:51:30,874
Who was there that morning
in bed with me?

931
00:51:33,999 --> 00:51:38,832
Miss, you wouldn't happen to be
you and your fiancé

932
00:51:38,916 --> 00:51:40,582
did you and your boyfriend agree that

933
00:51:40,666 --> 00:51:43,749
maybe by imagining
that I took advantage of you?

934
00:51:44,499 --> 00:51:49,457
Or by accusing me of being
responsible for this drama ?

935
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:53,207
My fiancé and I agree?
But for what reason ?

936
00:51:54,374 --> 00:51:55,999
Well, don't tell me.

937
00:51:56,082 --> 00:51:57,791
The reasons could be many.

938
00:51:57,874 --> 00:52:00,166
The need for money, for example.

939
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:02,041
What would I know?

940
00:52:02,124 --> 00:52:06,416
You could ask me for a loan
or even damages.

941
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:09,666
It is you and your fiancé
who have to tell me what you want from me.

942
00:52:09,749 --> 00:52:10,582
What do you want ?

943
00:52:10,666 --> 00:52:14,416
You may have great experience,
but you haven't understood a thing.

944
00:52:14,499 --> 00:52:18,082
Oh, no? Then you explain to me
what I didn't understand, please

945
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:20,374
- There is little to explain.
- Yes?

946
00:52:20,457 --> 00:52:23,916
I was tired of my boyfriend and I'm happy
that it all went wrong.

947
00:52:23,999 --> 00:52:27,291
Well, but then at this point
I breathe a sigh of relief.

948
00:52:28,082 --> 00:52:30,207
Oh there, look at that pizzone!

949
00:52:30,957 --> 00:52:31,791
Thank you.

950
00:52:32,541 --> 00:52:35,999
And what do you plan to do now ?

951
00:52:36,082 --> 00:52:37,999
- Now I am finally free.
- Well ?

952
00:52:38,707 --> 00:52:42,457
- We could be together every day.
- What's the point?

953
00:52:44,249 --> 00:52:47,541
Listen, engineer,
but when I speak you don't understand

954
00:52:47,624 --> 00:52:49,582
or do you pretend not to understand?

955
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:53,957
I still don't understand for what reason
you and I have to see each other.

956
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:55,374
(Federica) No reason,

957
00:52:55,457 --> 00:52:57,624
if there is harmony between us
and a relationship is born...

958
00:52:57,707 --> 00:53:00,749
(Armando) What harmony, what relationship?
Will you explain it to me?

959
00:53:00,832 --> 00:53:04,249
(Federica) There's nothing to explain,
if two people want to see each other, they see each other.

960
00:53:04,332 --> 00:53:06,207
(Armando) How, do they see each other? Excuse me.

961
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:09,082
Why do you want to see me?
Who am I to you?

962
00:53:09,166 --> 00:53:11,499
- (Alessandra) Armando !
- Alessandra.

963
00:53:11,582 --> 00:53:13,374
Who are you quarrelling with?

964
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:16,499
No, Miss Federica
accompanied me in the car.

965
00:53:16,582 --> 00:53:19,457
Don't just stand there on the street, bring it up.

966
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:20,332
But.

967
00:53:20,416 --> 00:53:22,749
yes, only a couple of minutes
because I have the night shift.

968
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,499
- What are you doing?
- Yes, let's go, come on.

969
00:53:25,249 --> 00:53:27,666
- Let's go.
- Eh, slowly.

970
00:53:37,707 --> 00:53:40,124
Good evening, Federica.

971
00:53:40,207 --> 00:53:41,582
Good evening, madam.

972
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:43,332
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

973
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:45,374
We've already met over the phone.

974
00:53:45,457 --> 00:53:48,832
Yes, I know, dear,
but it's good to see you

975
00:53:48,916 --> 00:53:53,249
and to finally meet you in person,
then I didn't know you were so beautiful.

976
00:53:53,332 --> 00:53:54,291
Thank you.

977
00:53:54,916 --> 00:53:58,082
What a beautiful house, beautiful !

978
00:54:01,499 --> 00:54:04,707
- Who knows how much you pay in rent.
- No, no rent.

979
00:54:04,791 --> 00:54:06,457
The house is my wife's.

980
00:54:06,541 --> 00:54:10,082
You see, my papà gave it to us
when we got married.

981
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:11,291
- Yes.
- Come, come.

982
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:12,707
- Sit there.
- Thank you.

983
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,541
- Have a drink.
- Thank you. She has to go to the hospital.

984
00:54:15,624 --> 00:54:17,999
- She's on the night shift.
- That's right, I'm already late.

985
00:54:18,082 --> 00:54:18,874
- Eh.
- But why ?

986
00:54:18,957 --> 00:54:21,041
- She's just arrived and you take her away from me ?
- I know.

987
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:22,624
- Duty calls me.
- Listen.

988
00:54:22,707 --> 00:54:26,041
But you have to promise me
to come back really soon.

989
00:54:26,124 --> 00:54:27,291
Certainly, madam.

990
00:54:27,374 --> 00:54:31,124
I hope you don't mind
if I steal your husband from you sometime.

991
00:54:31,207 --> 00:54:32,707
- Here he is.
- You're welcome.

992
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:35,874
In fact, I have so little time to devote to him, 
poor love.

993
00:54:35,957 --> 00:54:39,124
I'm always caught up
by all these duties of mine.

994
00:54:39,207 --> 00:54:42,916
I know, it is very noble what you do
for Third World hunger.

995
00:54:42,999 --> 00:54:46,041
Please, there is nothing noble
in what I do.

996
00:54:46,124 --> 00:54:49,332
You see, Federica,
I've had the good luck, or the bad luck,

997
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:51,541
to be born into a very rich family.

998
00:54:51,624 --> 00:54:54,749
Then I look for everything
To make it up to me.

999
00:54:55,499 --> 00:54:56,957
That's it, kiss.

1000
00:54:58,541 --> 00:54:59,999
- Bye.
- Bye, thank you.

1001
00:55:00,082 --> 00:55:00,874
Bye.

1002
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:03,207
- Good luck.
- Bye, Armando.

1003
00:55:03,582 --> 00:55:04,416
See you.

1004
00:55:05,624 --> 00:55:07,291
- (Federica) Goodbye.
- Bye.

1005
00:55:08,916 --> 00:55:11,124
Did you hear that?
"Bye, Armando, see you."

1006
00:55:11,207 --> 00:55:14,707
Well, what are you looking for?
Women today are like that, aren't they ?

1007
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:20,541
- Well, but I am surprised.
- But don't be so jurassic !

1008
00:55:20,624 --> 00:55:23,707
Instead, listen,
late as it is, where have you been?

1009
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:24,957
Give me your hand.

1010
00:55:25,041 --> 00:55:26,832
- Hand in hand.
- But why?

1011
00:55:26,916 --> 00:55:29,957
- Like children, in the park chatting.
- Oh, too cute.

1012
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:32,707
Then she offered me a pizza
which stuck in my stomach.

1013
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:35,457
Pizza? Poor love!
Come, I'll make you some chamomile tea.

1014
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:38,082
The staff are finished,
but I'll gladly make it for you.

1015
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:38,999
(Armando) Thank you.

1016
00:55:39,082 --> 00:55:42,957
Now that you have met her,
you have seen her properly,

1017
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:46,707
what do you think, Alessandra, of her?

1018
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:50,124
- What impression did she make on you?
- What impression did she make on me?

1019
00:55:50,207 --> 00:55:52,457
She is really beautiful.

1020
00:55:52,541 --> 00:55:55,916
Perhaps, you know,
she's a little bit strange for my taste,

1021
00:55:55,999 --> 00:55:58,457
but with that body...

1022
00:55:58,541 --> 00:56:02,124
She is also honest in appearance.

1023
00:56:02,207 --> 00:56:04,332
On the other hand, she is a nurse,

1024
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:07,916
and works all night
to earn a living.

1025
00:56:07,999 --> 00:56:11,374
She says she's a nurse,
but what do we know about who she really is?

1026
00:56:11,457 --> 00:56:15,666
Oh, look, Armando,
you have such suspicions,

1027
00:56:15,749 --> 00:56:19,416
you are adult enough
to know what to do, aren't you?

1028
00:56:20,166 --> 00:56:22,791
- You ask for information.
- Yeah.

1029
00:56:31,124 --> 00:56:33,249
Look, wait for me, huh.

1030
00:56:40,082 --> 00:56:43,207
- Good morning, are you a relative of the injured person?
- No, I don't know him.

1031
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:46,624
- I was asking about a nurse.
- Ask Sister Costanza.

1032
00:56:46,707 --> 00:56:48,957
- Bottom right.
- Bottom right ?

1033
00:56:56,791 --> 00:56:58,666
- (Armando) Sister Costanza?
- Yes.

1034
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:03,999
- Excuse me, Sister.
- Are you visiting someone?

1035
00:57:04,082 --> 00:57:06,249
No, no,
I came here to do some research,

1036
00:57:06,332 --> 00:57:09,499
but as I am here in the hospital,
I wanted to ask about a nurse.

1037
00:57:09,582 --> 00:57:13,291
- Which nurse ?
- Her name is Federica Pescatore.

1038
00:57:13,374 --> 00:57:15,999
I'm not sure,
but they told me she works here.

1039
00:57:16,082 --> 00:57:18,791
Yes, Federica Pescatore works here,
she works the night shift.

1040
00:57:18,874 --> 00:57:21,666
- This morning she left at 8 o'clock.
- Then it's true that she works here.

1041
00:57:21,749 --> 00:57:22,999
- Of course.
- Ah, good.

1042
00:57:23,082 --> 00:57:26,457
- Excuse me, who are you?
- Um, I'm a relative.

1043
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:28,832
I have known Federica since birth.

1044
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:31,249
Do you know that everyone in the town talks about her?

1045
00:57:31,332 --> 00:57:34,082
She has a great passion
for medicine.

1046
00:57:34,832 --> 00:57:40,082
Yes, and now, being here in the hospital,
how does the young lady conduct herself?

1047
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,082
- She is the pillar of this ward.
- Ah.

1048
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:44,041
She works at night to earn more money,

1049
00:57:44,124 --> 00:57:46,749
but the truth is that she's in love
with these old gentlemen.

1050
00:57:46,832 --> 00:57:47,999
- You know what I mean.
- Yes.

1051
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:51,832
- They want my blood, Sister Costanza.
- Do you hear? Do you hear?

1052
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:54,999
They want to take away my blood,
But I am afraid.

1053
00:57:55,082 --> 00:57:58,249
- If Federica doesn't come, I won't do it.
- Do you hear that?

1054
00:57:58,332 --> 00:58:01,041
- All right, she's coming tonight and I'll take it from you.
- Thank you.

1055
00:58:01,124 --> 00:58:03,124
Here, everyone is so fond of her.

1056
00:58:03,207 --> 00:58:05,457
After all, she does some really...

1057
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:08,291
She washes them, she shaves them,
she takes them to the bathroom.

1058
00:58:08,374 --> 00:58:10,707
- I don't tell her !
- And nice what I hear.

1059
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:11,582
Yes.

1060
00:58:11,666 --> 00:58:14,624
- It's rare for a young person as beautiful as her.
- Yes.

1061
00:58:14,707 --> 00:58:18,291
Well, actually, it is a bit strange,
because she's so beautiful and young!

1062
00:58:18,374 --> 00:58:21,124
I ask her: "How do you spend your nights
with these old gentlemen"

1063
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:22,791
"instead of going out and having fun ?"

1064
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,541
Yes, that's what I thought too,

1065
00:58:24,624 --> 00:58:28,957
but for such a young lady,
beautiful and stunning,

1066
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:31,499
isn't that very strange behaviour ?

1067
00:58:31,582 --> 00:58:35,457
Yes, indeed it is a bit strange,
but which one of us doesn't have oddities?

1068
00:58:36,207 --> 00:58:38,124
- Don't we?
- Allow me, sister.

1069
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:40,874
- For the little chapel, some flowers.
- Thank you.

1070
00:58:40,957 --> 00:58:41,999
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1071
00:58:42,082 --> 00:58:44,624
- Thank you, that was very kind.
- Thank you, thank you.

1072
00:58:50,082 --> 00:58:52,332
- (Armando) Duke ?
- (Duke) Yes, engineer.

1073
00:58:52,416 --> 00:58:57,124
Juraschi, take into account
Of the axial stress,

1074
00:58:57,207 --> 00:58:58,541
Between the rim and the rail.

1075
00:58:58,624 --> 00:59:00,666
He will see what he combines next.

1076
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:03,166
- Yes.
- Hello, Research.

1077
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:06,082
(Luciani) Yes, he is here, good.

1078
00:59:06,166 --> 00:59:07,749
- Ah, Luciani ?
- (Lucians) Yes ?

1079
00:59:07,832 --> 00:59:09,791
Call a taxi, I'm going home.

1080
00:59:09,874 --> 00:59:12,832
Miss Federica is downstairs,
she came to pick you up.

1081
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:14,624
- (Armando) Really?
- (Lucians) Yes.

1082
00:59:14,707 --> 00:59:15,666
(Armando) Federica ?

1083
00:59:22,624 --> 00:59:24,749
"Who is she?

1084
00:59:28,916 --> 00:59:31,707
She is a niece of mine, on my wife's side.

1085
00:59:32,374 --> 00:59:33,957
"Who is that?"

1086
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:36,666
- Congratulations, engineer.
- " Why do you care?

1087
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:51,207
Federica.

1088
00:59:52,332 --> 00:59:53,166
Armando.

1089
00:59:57,499 --> 00:59:59,082
Why the surprise ?

1090
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:00,957
Today is a special day.

1091
01:00:01,041 --> 01:00:03,666
I have a little present for you,
for your birthday.

1092
01:00:04,457 --> 01:00:07,332
No, no, Federica,
you don't have to do these things.

1093
01:00:07,416 --> 01:00:08,874
Come on, don't do these things.

1094
01:00:10,082 --> 01:00:13,249
For Saint Armando
you got me a beautiful pen.

1095
01:00:13,332 --> 01:00:15,291
What should I do in return?

1096
01:00:15,374 --> 01:00:16,749
Come have lunch with me.

1097
01:00:17,374 --> 01:00:20,666
It is I who should be delighted
to invite you to lunch,

1098
01:00:20,749 --> 01:00:22,749
but sadly, you know, my wife.

1099
01:00:22,832 --> 01:00:25,249
Not at all, today is a special day.

1100
01:00:25,332 --> 01:00:28,082
She cooked a turkey,
and a cake with candles...

1101
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,832
- Invite her as well.
- Champagne...

1102
01:00:29,916 --> 01:00:31,499
Oh right, we'll ask her.

1103
01:00:33,166 --> 01:00:37,166
- (Luisita) Hello, Andreoli residence.
- Yes, it's me, is my wife in?

1104
01:00:37,249 --> 01:00:40,124
No, she's having lunch at the Embassy,
she told me not to wait for her.

1105
01:00:40,207 --> 01:00:43,374
Then don't set the table
because I'm dining out too.

1106
01:00:43,457 --> 01:00:44,707
- YES.
- Let's have lunch together.

1107
01:00:44,791 --> 01:00:45,832
Then come with me.

1108
01:00:45,916 --> 01:00:47,582
- Let's have lunch together.
- Yes, I'll go with you.

1109
01:00:47,666 --> 01:00:50,499
- (Federica) Run.
- Don't run, don't run.

1110
01:00:51,249 --> 01:00:52,791
But blessed child.

1111
01:01:00,874 --> 01:01:03,666
I am so happy
to be with you all day!

1112
01:01:03,749 --> 01:01:07,041
Me too, but I don't know what happened.

1113
01:01:07,124 --> 01:01:12,832
You see, my wife, because of her job,
she has to make sacrifices, some renunciations.

1114
01:01:13,582 --> 01:01:17,707
She has great obligations,
but all for human welfare.

1115
01:01:17,791 --> 01:01:19,749
That's very impressive.

1116
01:01:20,499 --> 01:01:23,707
- When does she leave for Africa?
- I don't know, she needs to know today.

1117
01:01:24,707 --> 01:01:26,416
Do you mind if she leaves ?

1118
01:01:26,499 --> 01:01:27,874
Do I mind ?

1119
01:01:27,957 --> 01:01:31,332
I'm alone,
so what am I doing in the house alone ?

1120
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:33,999
You're there.

1121
01:01:35,707 --> 01:01:39,707
Yes, dear, I am there,
but that is something else.

1122
01:01:39,791 --> 01:01:42,499
Forty years of marriage,
that's no joke.

1123
01:01:44,249 --> 01:01:46,957
Why, sorry,
is our relationship a joke?

1124
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:50,666
No, now all jokes aside,
where are we going to eat ?

1125
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:52,207
Here we are.

1126
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:55,499
(Armando) Ah, Santa Maria in Trastevere.
Did you choose the 'restaurant'?

1127
01:01:55,582 --> 01:01:56,374
(Federica) Yes.

1128
01:02:03,957 --> 01:02:06,041
I know this restaurant.

1129
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:10,624
- How come you chose this one?
- And a surprise, come on, Armando.

1130
01:02:13,207 --> 01:02:16,499
- If you please, you are our guest.
- Guest of whom?

1131
01:02:17,874 --> 01:02:21,041
- Who are they?
- They are my parents, Papa and Mama.

1132
01:02:21,124 --> 01:02:22,291
Papa and Mama ?

1133
01:02:23,124 --> 01:02:23,957
Where ?

1134
01:02:26,207 --> 01:02:27,957
Federica, Federica ?

1135
01:02:28,791 --> 01:02:30,124
(Federica) Mamma, papà.

1136
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:32,749
" Papa-
- Hi.

1137
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:35,499
- " Mama, papà, look who's here.
- Good morning.

1138
01:02:35,582 --> 01:02:37,791
How do you do, my pleasure.

1139
01:02:37,874 --> 01:02:40,457
- Delighted.
- I am engineer Armando Andreoli.

1140
01:02:40,541 --> 01:02:41,707
- Sit down, Armando.
- Yes.

1141
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:43,041
We know who you are.

1142
01:02:43,124 --> 01:02:46,791
Every time she phones home,
Federica tells me a lot about you.

1143
01:02:46,874 --> 01:02:49,249
Oh really? I didn't know.

1144
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:52,249
With Federica
there are always surprises.

1145
01:02:53,124 --> 01:02:58,124
You see, I wasn't supposed to be here today,
but at my home.

1146
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:01,541
Today is his birthday,
but he has made himself available and spending time with us.

1147
01:03:01,624 --> 01:03:05,041
Well, then you stay for lunch with us
and all the best!

1148
01:03:05,124 --> 01:03:08,666
I'm turning 55 on Monday.

1149
01:03:08,749 --> 01:03:13,124
Well, time passes for everyone, madam,
but you look so young.

1150
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:16,291
Well, she looks very good, too, however.

1151
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:19,582
Are you passing through Rome?

1152
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:22,457
Yes, we came to buy
a second-hand car.

1153
01:03:22,541 --> 01:03:25,666
In fact, we just took a little trip
just to try it out.

1154
01:03:25,749 --> 01:03:30,624
But let's be honest,
we also came to meet you, you know.

1155
01:03:30,707 --> 01:03:32,332
Our curiosity was overwhelming.

1156
01:03:32,416 --> 01:03:33,874
Mamma

1157
01:03:33,957 --> 01:03:38,249
Well, after what happened
in that little hotel in Bologna...

1158
01:03:38,332 --> 01:03:40,499
- Mamma, don't insist.
- No, she must insist.

1159
01:03:40,582 --> 01:03:41,499
Go ahead, ma'am.

1160
01:03:41,582 --> 01:03:44,249
See, this is another little surprise.

1161
01:03:44,832 --> 01:03:49,416
- What did you tell mamma?
- (Federica) I didn't tell her anything.

1162
01:03:49,499 --> 01:03:52,457
I confided
with an aunt of mine and she talked.

1163
01:03:52,541 --> 01:03:54,874
That was wrong, you did wrong.

1164
01:03:55,416 --> 01:03:57,666
What are you on about, excuse me?

1165
01:03:57,749 --> 01:03:59,582
About our chance encounter ?

1166
01:04:00,791 --> 01:04:04,666
We met by chance,
a coincidence,

1167
01:04:04,749 --> 01:04:07,749
a matter of no importance.

1168
01:04:07,832 --> 01:04:08,666
What are you talking about?

1169
01:04:08,749 --> 01:04:11,457
(Father) The engineer is right,
she's a chatterbox!

1170
01:04:11,541 --> 01:04:12,332
That's it.

1171
01:04:12,416 --> 01:04:16,749
She went to talk to relatives,
friends and the whole town heard about it.

1172
01:04:16,832 --> 01:04:17,624
That's it.

1173
01:04:18,291 --> 01:04:20,416
What has the town come to hear?

1174
01:04:20,499 --> 01:04:24,916
Eh, that the fiancé has left her,
that the marriage is no longer taking place,

1175
01:04:24,999 --> 01:04:27,624
now Federica is dating someone else,

1176
01:04:27,707 --> 01:04:31,374
and she has this new relationship
 with an engineer.

1177
01:04:32,082 --> 01:04:33,707
Is the engineer me?

1178
01:04:34,332 --> 01:04:36,249
- (Armando) Ah, that's it.
- (Federica) Yes.

1179
01:04:37,124 --> 01:04:40,999
Look, the report that Federica says
is nonsense.

1180
01:04:41,082 --> 01:04:43,499
- Thank you.
- And it's all made up, it's incredible.

1181
01:04:43,582 --> 01:04:48,207
Engineer, I am a modest clerk,
but I'm very open-minded.

1182
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:52,374
In my daughter's personal affairs
I don't want to get involved in them.

1183
01:04:52,457 --> 01:04:55,666
She is a daughter who has always given us
so many concerns.

1184
01:04:55,749 --> 01:04:59,916
- What concerns, mama?
- So much, ever since she was a child.

1185
01:04:59,999 --> 01:05:03,082
She had typhus,
didn't want to take Communion,

1186
01:05:03,832 --> 01:05:06,082
a very different girl from all the rest.

1187
01:05:07,207 --> 01:05:11,416
She doesn't listen to anyone
and we now dare not oppose her.

1188
01:05:13,374 --> 01:05:14,957
She always does everything on her own.

1189
01:05:15,499 --> 01:05:20,166
Also this relationship with her,
we have to know more about you.

1190
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:27,582
 I don't know, if it's serious,
if you're thinking about an engagement.

1191
01:05:27,666 --> 01:05:28,874
 I don't know.

1192
01:05:31,374 --> 01:05:34,041
Federica, did you hear what your papà said?

1193
01:05:34,124 --> 01:05:38,166
yes, no, papà, for the time being
the engineer and I will see each other.

1194
01:05:38,249 --> 01:05:41,791
(Federica) We have a beautiful relationship,
and we're going out together.

1195
01:05:41,874 --> 01:05:43,957
In the future, maybe, who knows?

1196
01:05:46,749 --> 01:05:47,791
In the future, maybe, who knows?

1197
01:05:47,874 --> 01:05:50,999
That's right, precisely what ?
What is certain?

1198
01:05:51,082 --> 01:05:53,041
Papa, nothing is certain.

1199
01:05:53,624 --> 01:05:54,457
Eh.

1200
01:05:54,541 --> 01:05:57,082
(Federica) For the moment
we see each other for now.

1201
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:59,374
In the future, maybe we will get engaged.

1202
01:06:00,374 --> 01:06:01,874
Oh, my goodness!

1203
01:06:11,707 --> 01:06:14,291
Engineer, are you not feeling well ?

1204
01:06:14,916 --> 01:06:17,249
- (Father) How are you, engineer?
- Huh?

1205
01:06:17,332 --> 01:06:19,541
- (Father) How are you?
- I am perfectly fine.

1206
01:06:19,624 --> 01:06:23,832
Only I was thinking
that I have to leave.

1207
01:06:23,916 --> 01:06:24,916
No.

1208
01:06:24,999 --> 01:06:27,332
- (Armando) Yes, I have to go.
- But Armando?

1209
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,249
Eh, yes, I have to go.

1210
01:06:29,332 --> 01:06:31,207
I can't stay, I told you.

1211
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:33,249
- I shouldn't be here.
- Armando?

1212
01:06:33,332 --> 01:06:36,999
No, no, you sit here
and stay with papà and mamma.

1213
01:06:37,082 --> 01:06:39,749
We said what we had to say to each other,
We have said it.

1214
01:06:39,832 --> 01:06:44,374
I thank you for your invitation,
you have been very kind.

1215
01:06:44,457 --> 01:06:47,416
Excuse me, but I really
really have to go.

1216
01:06:47,499 --> 01:06:50,999
- Armando ?
- (Armando) I have to go, I'm leaving.

1217
01:06:53,082 --> 01:06:54,791
Papa, mamma, eat.

1218
01:06:54,874 --> 01:06:56,916
Nothing happened; that's just the way he is.

1219
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:01,957
Sorry.

1220
01:07:03,457 --> 01:07:07,374
I have never been so ashamed,
not even when I was in school.

1221
01:07:07,457 --> 01:07:09,041
Armando, stop.

1222
01:07:09,832 --> 01:07:12,499
- Armando, please stop.
- Yes, yes, yes, I will stop.

1223
01:07:12,582 --> 01:07:14,624
I really want to hear what you want,
so what do you want?

1224
01:07:14,707 --> 01:07:16,957
I know, I was wrong, but let me explain.

1225
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:18,416
But what do you want to explain ?

1226
01:07:18,499 --> 01:07:20,749
There is nothing to explain,
it's all clear.

1227
01:07:20,832 --> 01:07:22,624
You hooked me on the train,

1228
01:07:22,707 --> 01:07:26,374
then you had me found
by your boyfriend in bed with you.

1229
01:07:26,457 --> 01:07:30,416
Today at the restaurant with Papa and Mama,
can you believe it?

1230
01:07:30,499 --> 01:07:33,166
- What are these plots, these deceptions?
- No plot.

1231
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:35,666
I did it to make
peace with my parents.

1232
01:07:35,749 --> 01:07:39,041
Ah, so you make them feel at ease ?
By saying I'm the boyfriend ?

1233
01:07:39,124 --> 01:07:40,082
Me, at my age ?

1234
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:42,374
They live in a small village,
they are simple people.

1235
01:07:42,457 --> 01:07:44,666
You cannot understand
what kind of relationship there is between us.

1236
01:07:44,749 --> 01:07:47,624
But enough ! What relationship?
There is no relationship.

1237
01:07:47,707 --> 01:07:49,666
You must leave, you must disappear.

1238
01:07:49,749 --> 01:07:52,124
- Do you understand?
- Is this the love you want for me?

1239
01:07:52,207 --> 01:07:53,916
Who told you that I love you ?

1240
01:07:53,999 --> 01:07:56,499
These are all things you put in your mind.

1241
01:07:56,582 --> 01:07:58,791
You made them up out of your own imagination.

1242
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:02,124
All right, if you deny it, then explain to me
why when we are together

1243
01:08:02,207 --> 01:08:03,291
we love each other so much.

1244
01:08:04,416 --> 01:08:08,124
Do we love each other when we're together?
But if we always quarrel!

1245
01:08:08,207 --> 01:08:09,874
No, no, no !

1246
01:08:09,957 --> 01:08:11,791
Enough, enough!"

1247
01:08:11,874 --> 01:08:14,582
- What, enough ?
- Yes, enough, enough.

1248
01:08:14,666 --> 01:08:18,166
I am not an asshole
as your fiancé says,

1249
01:08:18,249 --> 01:08:21,332
I say, " Leave
and don't let me see you again."

1250
01:08:21,416 --> 01:08:26,457
Oh, if you come after me again
or call me, I'll call the police.

1251
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:27,749
- Understand ?
- Armando.

1252
01:08:27,832 --> 01:08:30,166
- Armando, come here.
- Taxi, taxi.

1253
01:08:32,082 --> 01:08:32,916
(Armando) Come on.

1254
01:08:32,999 --> 01:08:34,707
- (Federica) Armando.
- Go away !

1255
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:38,082
Armando !

1256
01:08:38,874 --> 01:08:39,957
Armando !

1257
01:08:41,041 --> 01:08:42,249
Coward !

1258
01:08:42,332 --> 01:08:43,457
Scoundrel !

1259
01:08:44,582 --> 01:08:46,582
May lightning strike you down !

1260
01:08:53,541 --> 01:08:55,916
Luisita, put things down here and here.

1261
01:08:55,999 --> 01:08:57,416
- Yes, ma'am.
- Alessandra.

1262
01:08:57,499 --> 01:08:59,082
Hey, Armando.

1263
01:08:59,166 --> 01:09:00,582
- "Hey, Armando."
- Hello.

1264
01:09:00,666 --> 01:09:01,457
So ?

1265
01:09:01,957 --> 01:09:03,582
- Have you decided ?
- Yes, I decided.

1266
01:09:03,666 --> 01:09:06,082
- I leave tomorrow morning at 11 a.m.
- Why ?

1267
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:10,749
Well, you know, there's the hospital to reorganise,
I just couldn't get out of it.

1268
01:09:11,499 --> 01:09:13,374
What about me? Are you leaving me alone ?

1269
01:09:13,457 --> 01:09:18,166
But darling, with all the love I have for you,
however, I too am entitled to my space.

1270
01:09:18,249 --> 01:09:19,207
- Yes.
- Do you think so ?

1271
01:09:19,874 --> 01:09:22,166
- Besides, you have yours too.
- Hmm.

1272
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:26,624
- (Alessandra) Luisita, then?
- spaces.

1273
01:09:26,707 --> 01:09:29,207
- (Alessandra) Did you put the lingerie away?
- Yes, madam.

1274
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:31,582
Take care,
don't make me worry.

1275
01:09:31,666 --> 01:09:33,624
- You already know, don't worry.
- Cholera and malaria.

1276
01:09:33,707 --> 01:09:34,999
Cell phone.

1277
01:09:35,082 --> 01:09:35,874
- Is it mine ?
- Yes.

1278
01:09:36,916 --> 01:09:38,874
- Yes, Engineer Andreoli, who is it?
- I'm leaving.

1279
01:09:38,957 --> 01:09:40,666
- The plane is leaving.
- Federica?

1280
01:09:40,749 --> 01:09:42,832
- You make the call, OK?
- Tell you what.

1281
01:09:42,916 --> 01:09:45,207
- I'm coming.
- I'm glad you phoned me.

1282
01:09:45,291 --> 01:09:49,332
We broke up arguing
and I take this opportunity to tell you that I'm sorry.

1283
01:09:49,416 --> 01:09:50,291
(Countess) Look.

1284
01:09:50,374 --> 01:09:53,416
(Armando) I want to be at peace with you,
even if we won't see each other again.

1285
01:09:53,499 --> 01:09:57,416
(Federica) I called you about this, that's why,
give me one more chance.

1286
01:09:57,499 --> 01:09:59,707
- I would like to invite you tonight to a party.
- Why?

1287
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:02,332
So I tell you that we won't see each other again
and you invite me to a party ?

1288
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:05,624
Don't get angry now,
do you remember my friend Mercedes?

1289
01:10:05,707 --> 01:10:06,957
What kind of party is this?

1290
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:10,332
It's for charity,
for Mercedes and her family.

1291
01:10:10,416 --> 01:10:12,291
If you come to the party, Armando,

1292
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:15,082
you will get a free membership
to the tango school.

1293
01:10:15,166 --> 01:10:17,624
(Armando) I don't want
any membership !

1294
01:10:17,707 --> 01:10:19,374
I'm not coming to the party.

1295
01:10:19,457 --> 01:10:21,541
- Will you listen to me ?
- No!

1296
01:10:21,624 --> 01:10:24,291
I no longer want to be involved
in your affairs.

1297
01:10:24,374 --> 01:10:27,291
- Who wants to involve you?
- Don't raise your voice to me, you know !

1298
01:10:27,374 --> 01:10:30,374
Come on, Armando,
don't start fighting right now.

1299
01:10:30,457 --> 01:10:32,374
- I'm about to take off.
- Go, darling.

1300
01:10:33,707 --> 01:10:35,499
Bye, darling, don't be mad, eh.

1301
01:10:35,582 --> 01:10:36,999
- Yes, love.
- Bye-bye.

1302
01:10:37,082 --> 01:10:38,707
- (Alessandra) Bye.
- Bye, love.

1303
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:41,832
- (Federica) To whom did you say: "Love?"
- Hi. Ah !

1304
01:10:41,916 --> 01:10:43,457
Why do you care ?

1305
01:10:43,541 --> 01:10:45,957
I told my wife
she's leaving for Africa.

1306
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,541
So I'll see you tonight

1307
01:10:47,624 --> 01:10:50,416
and we will dance together
a tango you'll never forget.

1308
01:10:50,499 --> 01:10:53,666
No, I don't tango with anyone.

1309
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:55,499
Goodbye forever.

1310
01:10:56,207 --> 01:10:58,207
Bon voyage, love.

1311
01:10:58,291 --> 01:10:59,499
Bye, Armando.

1312
01:11:01,791 --> 01:11:03,791
Come back soon.

1313
01:11:33,332 --> 01:11:34,624
Oh, ouch.

1314
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:35,957
What a kick !

1315
01:11:50,082 --> 01:11:51,791
Ah, another one ?

1316
01:11:54,082 --> 01:11:56,291
- Are you kicking me ?
- Yes.

1317
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:14,291
beautiful, isn't it ?

1318
01:12:28,582 --> 01:12:30,207
That's it, eh.

1319
01:12:38,707 --> 01:12:39,999
(Armando) Oh there, there.

1320
01:12:42,082 --> 01:12:44,249
(Armando) I love it, I love you.

1321
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:39,874


1322
01:13:44,457 --> 01:13:45,332
beautiful

1323
01:13:45,957 --> 01:13:47,416
Completely black.

1324
01:13:55,582 --> 01:13:56,874
So beautiful!

1325
01:14:03,874 --> 01:14:07,457
Federica, he called on the intercom,
your fiancé is on his way up.

1326
01:14:09,582 --> 01:14:10,416
Who ?

1327
01:14:10,499 --> 01:14:14,166
- Your fiancé?
- I don't know anything about it.

1328
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:15,666
- I swear.
- But how?

1329
01:14:15,749 --> 01:14:17,916
- You called him.
- (Federica) No, I swear.

1330
01:14:17,999 --> 01:14:20,416
- You made an arrangement.
- (Federica) That's not true.

1331
01:14:20,499 --> 01:14:22,957
Armando, come here, I didn't know.

1332
01:14:25,457 --> 01:14:26,707
Where did this happen to you ?

1333
01:14:27,624 --> 01:14:31,041
Eh, from Federica, at the tango school.

1334
01:14:34,749 --> 01:14:36,791
It was a sudden thing.

1335
01:14:37,999 --> 01:14:41,416
It's as if the blood
boiling in your head.

1336
01:14:42,207 --> 01:14:44,957
It's terrible, I didn't sleep all night.

1337
01:14:45,041 --> 01:14:48,457
I had palpitations, I couldn't breathe.

1338
01:14:49,374 --> 01:14:52,332
Of course, you've got yourself
in a state of excitement, friend.

1339
01:14:52,416 --> 01:14:54,999
I had strong feelings

1340
01:14:55,874 --> 01:14:59,207
which were a long time ago 
so many years since I had felt them.

1341
01:15:00,207 --> 01:15:01,041
Hmm.

1342
01:15:01,124 --> 01:15:04,291
- Why didn't you take advantage of it right away?
- The fiancé had arrived.

1343
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:08,874
Fuck, what's the fiance got to do with it?
Exactly, that's where you had to end it.

1344
01:15:08,957 --> 01:15:10,124
I don't know why.

1345
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:14,291
- Actually...
- (Velardi) What are you doing, crying?

1346
01:15:15,249 --> 01:15:16,332
Yes, I'm sick.

1347
01:15:18,957 --> 01:15:21,416
Oh, you haven't fallen in love, have you ?

1348
01:15:21,499 --> 01:15:23,207
oh.

1349
01:15:23,874 --> 01:15:24,707
Who is speaking ?

1350
01:15:26,207 --> 01:15:29,791
Tell the Minister
that the engineer is very sorry,

1351
01:15:30,666 --> 01:15:33,124
and he is in bed with a fever,
he cannot come.

1352
01:15:33,207 --> 01:15:33,999
No.

1353
01:15:34,582 --> 01:15:35,416
Oh.

1354
01:15:37,249 --> 01:15:41,791
Sorry, engineer, you haven't eaten since yesterday,
at least have some tea with biscuits.

1355
01:15:41,874 --> 01:15:44,791
Luisita I,
I'm breathing heavily and drinking tea ?

1356
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,874
I don't want anything, go away.

1357
01:15:46,957 --> 01:15:48,832
Leave me alone.

1358
01:15:48,916 --> 01:15:49,707
Since.

1359
01:15:49,791 --> 01:15:52,707
Hello ? Ah, Miss Federica.

1360
01:15:52,791 --> 01:15:54,457
No, the engineer is not here.

1361
01:15:54,541 --> 01:15:55,957
No ? And who am I ?

1362
01:15:56,041 --> 01:15:57,124
Give me the phone.

1363
01:15:57,666 --> 01:15:58,707
"She's not here."

1364
01:15:58,791 --> 01:16:00,207
Hello, Federica ?

1365
01:16:00,291 --> 01:16:02,749
That asshole left again,
when shall we meet?

1366
01:16:02,832 --> 01:16:04,291
Has the asshole left ?

1367
01:16:04,374 --> 01:16:06,707
I'm coming tonight, let's dance the tango.

1368
01:16:06,791 --> 01:16:09,082
No, tonight there are too many people.

1369
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:11,499
Let's meet at breakfast time
and we'll be alone.

1370
01:16:11,582 --> 01:16:12,832
- Alone ?
- YES.

1371
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:14,957
- My friends are not here
until this evening.

1372
01:16:15,041 --> 01:16:17,957
Let's eat something here,
I want to be alone with you for a while.

1373
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:20,374
I too need so much
to be alone with you.

1374
01:16:20,457 --> 01:16:22,082
Come soon, I'll be waiting for you.

1375
01:16:22,166 --> 01:16:23,916
- Come.
- Of course, I'm coming, yes.

1376
01:16:23,999 --> 01:16:26,957
Luisita, draw me a hot bath.

1377
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:29,999
Lily foam, scent of Arpège.

1378
01:16:30,082 --> 01:16:33,582
- Throw in a couple of rose petals.
- Whatever you want, engineer.

1379
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:35,166
- Yes.
- Have some tea.

1380
01:16:35,249 --> 01:16:37,249
Tea? The tango!

1381
01:16:37,332 --> 01:16:38,582
I am so happy !

1382
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:39,999
Go and prepare my bath.

1383
01:16:43,916 --> 01:16:45,457
Oh there, hooray!

1384
01:16:56,374 --> 01:16:58,582
Oh, my, my!

1385
01:16:58,666 --> 01:17:00,457
- What, are you impressed ?
- Yes.

1386
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:06,957
Tango !

1387
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:11,124
Armando mio, hold me tight.

1388
01:17:11,207 --> 01:17:12,332
Yes, my love.

1389
01:17:13,124 --> 01:17:17,416
Yes, I'll hold you, my beloved,
I've come just to hold you.

1390
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:18,832
Papa, Papa!

1391
01:17:18,916 --> 01:17:20,457
(Armando) (Just call me papà.)

1392
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:23,207
(Federica) My daddy isn't here anymore,
my papà has died!

1393
01:17:23,291 --> 01:17:25,707
- What, papà died?
- (Federica) Yes.

1394
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:26,624
When ?

1395
01:17:26,707 --> 01:17:29,207
He died yesterday,
they phoned me half an hour ago.

1396
01:17:29,291 --> 01:17:32,207
I have to go,
they're taking him away, I have to go!

1397
01:17:35,374 --> 01:17:39,374
Now that he is dead,
you have become my papà.

1398
01:17:40,374 --> 01:17:41,541
Yes.

1399
01:18:43,332 --> 01:18:46,166
(Armando) Uh, another flight of stairs.

1400
01:18:46,249 --> 01:18:48,541
- (Priest) Excuse me.
- Who is it? Ah, please.

1401
01:18:49,457 --> 01:18:50,291
You are welcome.

1402
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:56,332
What a disgrace.

1403
01:18:58,541 --> 01:18:59,957
Are they taking him away soon ?

1404
01:19:00,041 --> 01:19:01,916
Yes, engineer, they are taking him away.

1405
01:19:01,999 --> 01:19:04,707
- (Woman) Yes, yes, they'll take him away.
- (Woman 2) Yes, engineer.

1406
01:19:06,499 --> 01:19:08,791
Armando, Armando.

1407
01:19:08,874 --> 01:19:11,374
- (together) Engineer, they're calling you.
- What?

1408
01:19:11,457 --> 01:19:13,957
- (Woman) They are calling you.
- Armando, what are you doing there? Come up.

1409
01:19:14,041 --> 01:19:15,332
Shall I come up?

1410
01:19:17,249 --> 01:19:18,374
Coming up.

1411
01:19:28,207 --> 01:19:29,249
Here comes Papa.

1412
01:19:30,457 --> 01:19:31,291
Papa.

1413
01:19:37,582 --> 01:19:38,874
Papa, look who's here.

1414
01:19:41,041 --> 01:19:42,749
Armando, aren't you going to say hello to my papà?

1415
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:49,082
- (Mother) Engineer?
- Who is she?

1416
01:19:49,166 --> 01:19:50,582
Ah, madam.

1417
01:19:51,957 --> 01:19:54,082
- Did you see that misfortune?
- How did it happen?

1418
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:57,749
How should I know?
We were over there, he was fine.

1419
01:19:57,832 --> 01:20:00,582
- He was fine and suddenly...
- I feel awful!

1420
01:20:00,666 --> 01:20:03,207
- I feel awful!
- What is it?

1421
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:05,749
Come on, Armando, they're taking Papa away.

1422
01:20:05,832 --> 01:20:06,916
Let's go now.

1423
01:20:08,124 --> 01:20:09,082
Let's go, let's go.

1424
01:20:11,166 --> 01:20:13,582
My daughter is left alone, engineer.

1425
01:20:13,666 --> 01:20:16,999
Take care,
love her very, very much.

1426
01:20:17,082 --> 01:20:19,582
Now that papà is gone,
when are you planning to get married?

1427
01:20:19,666 --> 01:20:22,291
- Well...
- We'll get married as soon as the mourning is over.

1428
01:20:22,374 --> 01:20:25,832
- What mourning, what mourning ? Get married right away.
- It's not up to me.

1429
01:20:25,916 --> 01:20:29,082
- With whomever? Aren't you the man?
- Yes, madam.

1430
01:20:29,166 --> 01:20:31,082
Ma'am?
Call me aunt and give me a kiss.

1431
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:34,749
- Don't you ?
- We're going now, aunt.

1432
01:20:34,832 --> 01:20:35,707
- That's it, yes.
- Bye.

1433
01:20:35,791 --> 01:20:37,957
- We have to go.
- Bye, love.

1434
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:39,249
- Bye.
- Bye.

1435
01:20:39,332 --> 01:20:41,416
- Take care.
- Take it easy.

1436
01:20:41,499 --> 01:20:42,666
(Mother) Bye.

1437
01:20:42,749 --> 01:20:46,124
(Woman) Listen, but your daughter
where did she find this engineer?

1438
01:20:46,207 --> 01:20:50,291
(Woman 2) But he seems like a good Christian,
your daughter has settled down,

1439
01:20:50,374 --> 01:20:51,541
what more do you want ?

1440
01:20:55,374 --> 01:20:57,582
Goodbye, Armando, goodbye.

1441
01:21:02,666 --> 01:21:05,166
What do we do now? Don't we eat today?

1442
01:21:08,582 --> 01:21:10,291
Thank you, Armando.

1443
01:21:11,374 --> 01:21:15,166
- And what?
- Of everything, I feel happy next to you.

1444
01:21:20,207 --> 01:21:21,291
Listen, Federica.

1445
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:26,999
Now that you have calmed down
from this great pain of yours,

1446
01:21:27,082 --> 01:21:32,791
and we are about to consummate
this wonderful night of love,

1447
01:21:33,957 --> 01:21:37,207
please for the future,

1448
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:40,582
do not spoil
this imminent pleasure of being together

1449
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:42,999
By saying meaningless things

1450
01:21:43,541 --> 01:21:47,041
- Why, what did I say?
- You mentioned marriage.

1451
01:21:47,999 --> 01:21:49,999
I understand, Federica,

1452
01:21:50,082 --> 01:21:53,291
That you said that
To reassure your mother and relatives,

1453
01:21:53,374 --> 01:21:55,666
but you shouldn't say these things.

1454
01:21:55,749 --> 01:21:58,541
You shouldn't say
even in jest

1455
01:21:58,624 --> 01:22:02,666
But I wasn't joking,
I really want to marry you.

1456
01:22:02,749 --> 01:22:04,624
There, do you see !

1457
01:22:04,707 --> 01:22:06,916
Do you see that you are talking without thinking ?

1458
01:22:07,416 --> 01:22:10,249
I have been married for more than 40 years,
I'm getting married ?

1459
01:22:11,041 --> 01:22:11,874
I know.

1460
01:22:13,249 --> 01:22:17,541
you desire me now
and tonight you want to be with me.

1461
01:22:19,457 --> 01:22:20,499
Yes, beloved.

1462
01:22:21,207 --> 01:22:22,499
I yearn for you.

1463
01:22:23,166 --> 01:22:26,874
I look forward to this night
to be with you,

1464
01:22:26,957 --> 01:22:28,582
But I am still married.

1465
01:22:28,666 --> 01:22:30,249
Who cares? We'll run away.

1466
01:22:30,332 --> 01:22:32,832
We'll run away? Where do do we run to?

1467
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:37,541
There, you see that ?
Do you see the nonsense you talk ?

1468
01:22:37,624 --> 01:22:39,957
What nonsense ? You can everything.

1469
01:22:40,457 --> 01:22:42,457
Go to the bank,
take all the money you have,

1470
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:46,624
then sell your property
and move far away from here,

1471
01:22:46,707 --> 01:22:48,457
On a desert island in the Caribbean.

1472
01:22:48,541 --> 01:22:50,541
That's it, yeah.

1473
01:22:50,624 --> 01:22:53,582
I take all the money in the bank,
I sell my properties

1474
01:22:53,666 --> 01:22:55,707
And we are going to live in the Caribbean.

1475
01:22:55,791 --> 01:22:56,666
- Yes.
- Olé.

1476
01:22:56,749 --> 01:22:58,624
Eh, good, good.

1477
01:22:58,707 --> 01:22:59,874
And then ?

1478
01:22:59,957 --> 01:23:02,791
Then you file for divorce and we get married.

1479
01:23:02,874 --> 01:23:08,666
So you put poison in my coffee
And you become the owner of everything.

1480
01:23:08,749 --> 01:23:12,499
Did you plan this
you and your fiancé ?

1481
01:23:15,124 --> 01:23:16,916
Ah, is that what you think of me ?

1482
01:23:16,999 --> 01:23:19,457
That I want to put
poison in your coffee?

1483
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:22,041
Listen, dear.

1484
01:23:23,041 --> 01:23:27,916
I have tried with all my might
to banish this ghost,

1485
01:23:27,999 --> 01:23:29,166
but I was unable to do so.

1486
01:23:29,249 --> 01:23:32,791
I have been wary
from the very first moment.

1487
01:23:33,707 --> 01:23:34,957
You said it today.

1488
01:23:35,832 --> 01:23:37,999
It is my heritage that you are interested in.

1489
01:23:38,082 --> 01:23:40,624
You never cared about me at all !

1490
01:23:41,916 --> 01:23:43,957
- Ah, that's right.
- YES.

1491
01:23:44,874 --> 01:23:46,041
Where are you going ?

1492
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:48,541
Listen, you old hypocrite.

1493
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:51,082
Because you are stubborn

1494
01:23:51,166 --> 01:23:53,832
And I can't make you understand
That I am sincere,

1495
01:23:53,916 --> 01:23:55,207
I'll tell you just one thing.

1496
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:57,499
- Take it or leave it.
- Leave.

1497
01:23:57,582 --> 01:23:58,374
What?

1498
01:23:59,041 --> 01:24:00,457
Leave !

1499
01:24:01,791 --> 01:24:03,832
Then go away, go away !

1500
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:07,832
Leave, leave,
I never want to see you again !

1501
01:24:07,916 --> 01:24:10,957
Get out ! Leave, leave, go away !

1502
01:24:11,041 --> 01:24:13,457
- Oh, Oh !
- Go away !

1503
01:24:13,541 --> 01:24:16,124
Damned be the day
on which I met you !

1504
01:24:33,166 --> 01:24:34,499
- Oh!
- Oh.

1505
01:24:34,582 --> 01:24:36,499
- Is this going to Rome ?
- Yes.

1506
01:24:36,582 --> 01:24:37,374
Please open.

1507
01:24:48,707 --> 01:24:49,999
- Excuse me, commander.
- Yes.

1508
01:24:50,082 --> 01:24:52,124
Has the private plane from Mozambique arrived?

1509
01:24:52,207 --> 01:24:54,832
- That's us, we've just arrived.
- Armando, Armando.

1510
01:24:54,916 --> 01:24:57,207
- Alessandra.
- Love.

1511
01:24:59,916 --> 01:25:01,082
I'm back.

1512
01:25:24,082 --> 01:25:26,624
So are all the problems solved there?

1513
01:25:26,707 --> 01:25:27,874
All resolved.

1514
01:25:27,957 --> 01:25:30,124
Any help is a drop in the ocean.

1515
01:25:30,207 --> 01:25:33,374
If you only knew what pain, what immense pain,

1516
01:25:33,457 --> 01:25:36,791
with all these human skeletons
asking for help.

1517
01:25:36,874 --> 01:25:41,249
Look, a real shame
for the so-called civilised world.

1518
01:25:41,957 --> 01:25:44,124
Then, my love, I want to tell you something.

1519
01:25:44,207 --> 01:25:45,707
Listen, I want to confess this to you.

1520
01:25:45,791 --> 01:25:51,374
I didn't tell you from afar
because I didn't want you to worry.

1521
01:25:51,457 --> 01:25:55,707
You see, when I saw
the fever continuing to rise,

1522
01:25:55,791 --> 01:25:59,707
and I found myself
in the presence of death,

1523
01:25:59,791 --> 01:26:05,249
in a solitude
very extreme, very painful loneliness,

1524
01:26:05,332 --> 01:26:08,832
then, I understood then, Armando,

1525
01:26:08,916 --> 01:26:12,624
That the only thing in the world,

1526
01:26:12,707 --> 01:26:16,499
that is really important to me, is you.

1527
01:26:19,582 --> 01:26:20,416
Love.

1528
01:26:21,707 --> 01:26:22,541
Love.

1529
01:26:23,666 --> 01:26:24,582
No.

1530
01:26:25,249 --> 01:26:26,082
No.

1531
01:26:27,374 --> 01:26:28,207
No.

1532
01:26:30,041 --> 01:26:30,874
No.

1533
01:26:31,666 --> 01:26:33,249
It's not my fault.

1534
01:26:34,541 --> 01:26:35,374
No.

1535
01:26:36,624 --> 01:26:37,457
No.

1536
01:26:38,499 --> 01:26:40,499
It is not my fault.

1537
01:26:41,582 --> 01:26:44,332
Then you have fallen in love with her.

1538
01:27:00,499 --> 01:27:01,874
God, God

1539
01:27:22,041 --> 01:27:23,999
(Mercedes) (Do you like tango ?)

1540
01:27:24,082 --> 01:27:27,041
(Because the man and the woman
dance separately).

1541
01:27:27,124 --> 01:27:29,541
(The tango is much more sensual,
I mean...)

1542
01:27:29,624 --> 01:27:32,832
- (Federica) Where do we go now ?
- (George) In the hotel, at Dad's.

1543
01:27:32,916 --> 01:27:36,207
He has just arrived from Argentina,
he is so anxious to meet you.

1544
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:39,124
- Will you accompany me?
- You couldn't have a better partner.

1545
01:27:39,207 --> 01:27:40,916
- Now.
- papà is a great dancer.

1546
01:27:40,999 --> 01:27:42,791
- Will you accompany me ?
- You will arrive together.

1547
01:27:42,874 --> 01:27:45,374
I will be in the church waiting for you,
don't do as you normally do.

1548
01:27:45,457 --> 01:27:47,791
- Yes, but let's leave right away.
- Have you decided where to go?

1549
01:27:47,874 --> 01:27:52,791
Far away, as far away as possible,
where I've always dreamed of going.

1550
01:27:52,874 --> 01:27:56,666
(Federica) On a desert island
in the Caribbean Sea.

1551
01:28:50,874 --> 01:28:51,707
Hold.

1552
01:28:59,332 --> 01:29:02,832
- A small coffee, please serve it to me outside.
- (Waiter) All right.

1553
01:29:23,999 --> 01:29:24,957
A ristretto coffee.

1554
01:29:26,666 --> 01:29:27,499
Thank you.

1555
01:29:56,416 --> 01:29:57,541
(Woman) She's coming.

1556
01:31:37,916 --> 01:31:38,957
Alessandra ?

1557
01:31:41,916 --> 01:31:42,916
Alessandra ?

1558
01:31:45,124 --> 01:31:46,249
Where are you ?

1559
01:31:46,332 --> 01:31:47,374
Luisita ?

1560
01:31:48,416 --> 01:31:50,499
Luisita, but is there no one there ?

1561
01:31:51,457 --> 01:31:52,291
Where are you ?

1562
01:31:53,416 --> 01:31:54,624
Luisita ?

1563
01:31:58,082 --> 01:32:00,666
Why did you prepare only one place setting?

1564
01:32:00,749 --> 01:32:02,416
- Yes, engineer.
- What about my wife ?

1565
01:32:02,499 --> 01:32:03,457
She has left.

1566
01:32:03,541 --> 01:32:05,207
- Did she leave?
- Yes.

1567
01:32:05,291 --> 01:32:07,207
She went to Piedmont to her sister.

1568
01:32:07,874 --> 01:32:09,582
She left you a letter.

1569
01:32:25,541 --> 01:32:29,582
(Alessandra) (Dear Armando,
I left for Turin this morning).

1570
01:32:30,166 --> 01:32:34,041
(I'm going to my sister's and I'll stay with her
I don't know for how long).

1571
01:32:34,124 --> 01:32:36,957
(In fact, you see,
I can't accept the idea)

1572
01:32:37,041 --> 01:32:39,791
(that you have fallen in love
with your young friend,)

1573
01:32:39,874 --> 01:32:41,207
(I just can't do it).

1574
01:32:41,291 --> 01:32:46,374
(I need to think
and I think you need to as well).

1575
01:32:46,457 --> 01:32:48,582
(Maybe we'll talk again.)

1576
01:32:48,666 --> 01:32:50,624
(Sorry. Alessandra.)

1577
01:32:52,291 --> 01:32:55,374
Engineer, rigatoni all'amatriciana.

1578
01:33:01,124 --> 01:33:02,041
Amatriciana ?

1579
01:33:05,707 --> 01:33:06,541
Eh, put.

1580
01:33:24,874 --> 01:33:26,291
I'm not hungry anyway.

1581
01:33:47,666 --> 01:33:49,624
But how can I do without her ?

1582
01:34:49,041 --> 01:34:52,166
(Alessandra) ( That's when,
I understood it then, Armando,)

1583
01:34:52,249 --> 01:34:56,249
(that the only thing in the world,)

1584
01:34:56,332 --> 01:35:00,166
(which is really important to me, is you).

1585
01:35:01,291 --> 01:35:02,457
Alessandra.

1586
01:35:12,749 --> 01:35:14,707
Yes, Andreoli, who is it?

1587
01:35:15,416 --> 01:35:17,541
(Alessandra) Armando, it's me.

1588
01:35:17,624 --> 01:35:19,207
Alessandra.

1589
01:35:20,124 --> 01:35:21,499
Finally.

1590
01:35:22,416 --> 01:35:24,499
So I'll see you tomorrow morning?

1591
01:35:25,041 --> 01:35:27,624
Yes, I have already left.

1592
01:35:27,707 --> 01:35:30,332
I arrive precisely in Turin,
and see you at the station.

1593
01:35:30,916 --> 01:35:34,749
Platform number 7,
the Saint Moritz carriage, number 9.

1594
01:35:34,832 --> 01:35:39,791
Armando, after so long
I'm very excited, so you know?

1595
01:35:39,874 --> 01:35:41,249
And I'm really excited, Alessandra ?

1596
01:35:42,832 --> 01:35:45,041
Listen, are you still thinking about her?

1597
01:35:45,832 --> 01:35:47,999
- Who her?
- Come on, don't pretend!

1598
01:35:48,082 --> 01:35:52,082
- You know who I'm talking about.
- Alessandra, it's been a long time.

1599
01:35:52,166 --> 01:35:56,249
The story with that woman
ended before your departure.

1600
01:35:56,332 --> 01:35:59,082
I haven't heard from her
since that time.

1601
01:35:59,166 --> 01:36:00,457
I want to believe you.

1602
01:36:00,541 --> 01:36:02,916
I love you, Alessandra, I love you.

1603
01:36:02,999 --> 01:36:04,957
I love you so much too.

1604
01:36:05,624 --> 01:36:06,791
Goodnight.

1605
01:36:07,582 --> 01:36:08,832
Good night, dear.

1606
01:36:08,916 --> 01:36:11,666
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night, see you tomorrow.

1607
01:36:14,124 --> 01:36:15,166
But that was crazy business.

1608
01:36:15,916 --> 01:36:17,332
"Still thinking about that one ?"

1609
01:36:53,791 --> 01:36:55,416
Excuse me, thank you.

1610
01:36:59,291 --> 01:37:01,041
- (Child) Mother.
- Engineer.

1611
01:37:01,124 --> 01:37:03,416
- Who is ?
- Giorgio.

1612
01:37:03,499 --> 01:37:06,916
- The fiancé, remember Federica?
- Eh, gosh !

1613
01:37:06,999 --> 01:37:10,999
Federica's infamous fiancé,
yeah, right.

1614
01:37:11,082 --> 01:37:13,916
- Where are you going?
- To Turin to meet relatives.

1615
01:37:13,999 --> 01:37:17,582
- Ah, is that your son?
- Yes, he's my son.

1616
01:37:17,666 --> 01:37:19,666
- Eh!
- Is Federica in the cabin ?

1617
01:37:19,749 --> 01:37:21,124
- Federica ?
- Eh.

1618
01:37:21,207 --> 01:37:23,582
That's my wife, she's German.

1619
01:37:24,374 --> 01:37:26,749
What are you talking about?

1620
01:37:26,832 --> 01:37:28,624
I was there that morning.

1621
01:37:28,707 --> 01:37:31,874
She was at the door,
Federica arrived in a Rolls-Royce.

1622
01:37:31,957 --> 01:37:33,666
You entered the church, what happened?

1623
01:37:33,749 --> 01:37:37,332
True, then once in front of the altar
she changed her mind and left.

1624
01:37:37,416 --> 01:37:39,416
- (Giorgio) She ran away.
- She ran away?

1625
01:37:39,499 --> 01:37:42,207
Yes, she ran away
with my papà to South America.

1626
01:37:42,291 --> 01:37:43,749
With your papà?

1627
01:37:43,832 --> 01:37:46,832
Look, with Federica
it's no wonder.

1628
01:37:46,916 --> 01:37:48,874
The man didn't matter to her.

1629
01:37:49,624 --> 01:37:52,541
In fact, she preferred
your papà's money.

1630
01:37:53,124 --> 01:37:55,082
Your papà is very rich, isn't he?

1631
01:37:55,166 --> 01:37:56,457
My papà rich?

1632
01:37:56,541 --> 01:37:58,207
He never had a lira.

1633
01:37:58,291 --> 01:38:00,207
He has done a thousand jobs in life.

1634
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,582
He has always made do.

1635
01:38:01,666 --> 01:38:05,749
Do you think he is now an entertainer
on a cruise ship in the Caribbean.

1636
01:38:05,832 --> 01:38:06,874
But what about ?

1637
01:38:07,457 --> 01:38:08,624
In the Caribbean ?

1638
01:38:08,707 --> 01:38:10,249
She did it, eh.

1639
01:38:12,499 --> 01:38:13,957
- Did you see them again?
- No.

1640
01:38:14,041 --> 01:38:17,332
Every now and then they send some postcards,
in fact, I should have one here.

1641
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:19,832
- It arrived today, here it is.
- Oh there.

1642
01:38:19,916 --> 01:38:21,832
(Armando) Are they on this ship?

1643
01:38:21,916 --> 01:38:22,957
They dance in pairs.

1644
01:38:23,999 --> 01:38:24,832
Tango.

1645
01:38:27,707 --> 01:38:29,166
Goodbye, engineer.

1646
01:38:29,249 --> 01:38:31,499
- Best wishes.
- To you.

1647
01:38:31,582 --> 01:38:33,457
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1648
01:38:41,957 --> 01:38:43,416
(Armando) (Ah, Federica.)

1649
01:38:44,124 --> 01:38:45,624
(What have you done?)

1650
01:40:34,624 --> 01:40:36,707
