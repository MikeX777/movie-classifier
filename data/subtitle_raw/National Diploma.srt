1
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,198
Every year in the Democratic
Republic of Congo,

2
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,351
almost 500000 young people sit the
equivalent of the baccalaureate.

3
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,477
The stakes are very high for them,
their future depends on it.

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,039
Athénée Royal - Kisangani
Democratic Republic of Congo

5
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,674
Royal High School?

6
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,430
Royal Junk Yard, more like!

7
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,510
To think we still have another
7,000 francs to pay...

8
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,469
No, 21,000.

9
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,230
NATIONAL DIPLOMA

10
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,518
Since my parents passed away,

11
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,633
it's hard for me to
pay for my studies.

12
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,193
Especially now, at
the end of the year,

13
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,797
when we're thrown out
because of teachers' fees.

14
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,269
I live at my aunt's.

15
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,950
She helps me to get by.

16
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,555
But I have to find a way
to pay the teachers' fees.

17
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,590
I'm at the market
morning and evening.

18
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,032
I have to unpack and pack goods,

19
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,433
then take them to the warehouse.

20
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,519
At this rate, I'm worried I
won't get my National Diploma

21
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,158
and remain a market
porter all my life.

22
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,431
That's why I'm here to see you.

23
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,918
I want you to help
me to succeed.

24
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,796
Help me get my National Diploma

25
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,869
so my life won't be wasted.

26
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,314
I really need your help.

27
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,433
Don't worry, we're
going to help you.

28
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,199
Get the plants that
fight bad luck.

29
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,712
Crush them and mix
them with water.

30
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,318
Come back regularly until
the day before the exam.

31
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,315
I have other plants for
you to put on your face.

32
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,480
Today is just a beginning.

33
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,312
Fetch that chair.

34
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,318
He has to climb onto this chair

35
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,751
and purify his body
with this water.

36
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,549
And, while he purifies himself,

37
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,760
he must talk to the ancestors
about his problem.

38
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,556
Give him the chair and
follow him to the shower.

39
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,278
You don't have to undress
during the ceremony.

40
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,799
All my projects...

41
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,680
must succeed.

42
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,473
The National Diploma...

43
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,429
I mustn't fail...

44
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,109
Say it all one more time.

45
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,830
All my projects...

46
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,270
must meet with success, with
success, with success...

47
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,038
Insist on the Diploma.

48
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,278
I want to get my
National Diploma.

49
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,675
"People of Congo... Reject
Evil, think of Good,

50
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,793
work hard and all will go well."

51
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,720
"The leader is a
superior among equals.

52
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,600
A democratic leader
makes work easier."

53
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,071
- Are you on time?
- No, I...

54
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,795
If you say no, you
think you aren't late!

55
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,036
I apologize.

56
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,875
- Has this one been done?
- Yes.

57
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,715
- This one too?
- Yes, we started here.

58
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,194
Excuse us...

59
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,958
Take that vest off.

60
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,549
Thank you. Sit down.

61
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,636
Yesterday, we said we'd exclude
those who haven't paid the fee.

62
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,550
Here we are?

63
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,797
The bursar is here.

64
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,871
He has to throw out
those who haven't paid.

65
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,709
We've waited a long time

66
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,589
but there's no money.

67
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,635
We have to pay the teachers.
They're hungry.

68
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,037
They have to live too.

69
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,793
- Yes, OK...
- All right, thank you.

70
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,150
Come up when I call your names.

71
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,549
Alice, come up here.

72
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,799
Djafari, come up here.

73
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,519
Lohoka, come up here.

74
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,879
Gandi, come up here.

75
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,876
Gently! No need to jostle me.

76
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,714
Explain to him we're
in the final year.

77
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,150
- The principal said he'd accept us.
- Not to me, he didn't.

78
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,794
- At the assembly...
- He has to talk to the teachers first.

79
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,431
At the assembly, he
told us to wait.

80
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,916
He told us we could
study until Saturday.

81
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,674
Go downstairs!

82
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,115
If you don't leave, the
teachers won't come in.

83
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,439
Then what do we do?

84
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,551
He told us that himself!

85
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,076
Let's see the principal.
It'll be a lot simpler.

86
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,034
Let's see him.

87
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,952
Sir, we're in the final year.
The principal...

88
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,552
You talk too much. You're
winding everyone up.

89
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,432
We want democracy!

90
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,956
Democracy isn't disorder.

91
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,389
The principal told us we could
study until Saturday...

92
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,520
- He said so at the assembly...
- Go downstairs!

93
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,839
What's your problem?

94
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,676
We haven't studied for weeks now

95
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,516
because of the
teachers' strikes.

96
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,599
The teachers have just
started work again.

97
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,755
Let us stay one more week...

98
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,153
When was the third
instalment due to be paid?

99
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,110
After the Easter holiday.

100
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,231
True or false?

101
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,200
Did you respect that?

102
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,069
If you'd paid at least 15,000
francs, we'd let you stay

103
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,432
I told you clearly: pay on time!

104
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,398
We'll pay, Papa, we'll pay.

105
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,030
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

106
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,677
The teacher threw you out.
Go home now

107
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,350
and come back tomorrow

108
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,876
But if you can't pay by
Saturday, don't come back.

109
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,950
For now, just go home.

110
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,709
- Yes, my girl.
- Mum...

111
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,959
- She gave you the money?
- Yes.

112
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,197
How much?

113
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,437
- 20,000 francs.
- No.

114
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,078
I'm not taking it.

115
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,879
Listen...

116
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,800
We're the leaders of our class.

117
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,079
We have to launch our
"maquis" plan fast.

118
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,790
That said,

119
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,919
we quickly need to
find a house to rent.

120
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,677
We need to react fast

121
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,235
to be ready for the
National Exam.

122
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,158
We'd already spotted a
few unfinished houses

123
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,072
that we could use as a "maquis".

124
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,950
But since we had
no money for rent,

125
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,793
we had to forget it.

126
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,356
We have to hurry...

127
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,235
We're running out of time!

128
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,799
Can we find one in the
musicians' district?

129
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,078
There are a lot there.

130
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,593
A lot, yes, but we have to pay.

131
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,309
Here's what I think:

132
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,078
as leaders, it's up to us

133
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:24,197
to find a way of paying at
least part of the rent.

134
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,994
We mustn't wait for the
whole class to chip in

135
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,591
if we want to move fast.

136
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,109
Let's say each student
has to pay $25.

137
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,234
Before the 15th of next month.

138
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,836
I know students who
are ready to pay...

139
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,558
Let me finish, please!

140
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,073
As I was saying,
$25 to take part

141
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,990
and we begin on June 15th.

142
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,679
We also accept small
down payments

143
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,670
as long as the sum is
reached by the 15th.

144
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,234
That's what we'll tell everyone.

145
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,194
Move it, pal.

146
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,878
Gangway!

147
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,633
Watch out.

148
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,716
We're here in this room for
the mock National Exam.

149
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,758
No excuses today.

150
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,553
It was clearly stated that only
students who have paid in full

151
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,709
will be allowed
to sit this exam.

152
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,074
When we throw you out, we'll
take the papers. Too bad.

153
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,829
If you haven't paid, you're
disqualified from the exam.

154
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,233
Let's start checking.

155
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,435
If you haven't paid,
give us your paper.

156
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,596
Or if you have the
money, come and pay.

157
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,831
Let's start here.

158
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,591
Fandama.

159
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,992
You haven't paid!

160
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,074
Take her exam paper.

161
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,919
Calm down, OK.

162
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,829
You got thrown out too?

163
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,795
What do you think?

164
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,717
Let's see the principal.

165
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,793
Forget it.

166
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,315
Let's see him. He might
listen this time.

167
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,395
Forget it, I said.

168
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,759
You know what he's going to say.

169
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,319
Let's see him.

170
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,791
You're looking for
trouble for no reason...

171
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,557
This time, all you'll
get is a slap.

172
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,473
He won't slap anyone if
there's a lot of us.

173
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,990
Go without us!

174
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,113
If it works, too bad for you.

175
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,078
Guys, let's see the principal.

176
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,636
Come on, we'll apologize to him.

177
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,757
Let's wait. He's busy.

178
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,993
You haven't paid either?

179
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,349
Would I be here if I had?

180
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,833
It's like we've played hooky all
year without meaning to, huh?

181
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,394
I don't tell my parents about
these exclusions anymore.

182
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,635
I already know what they'll say.

183
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,354
I've stopped telling mine too.

184
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,278
I swear it's no use!

185
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,470
They know we have to
pay to attend school

186
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,194
but always act as if they don't.

187
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,398
I asked them for the fees
three times this week.

188
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,840
But they don't react.

189
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,431
Mr. Chairman, take the floor.

190
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,239
We've all gathered here

191
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,311
because we only have two
months left to get ready.

192
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,398
You know what's
happening at school.

193
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,194
We haven't studied properly all
year because of absent teachers.

194
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,474
The lessons have resumed now

195
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,434
but we're excluded
because of the fees.

196
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,957
Whatever happens,
exclusion or not,

197
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,230
we'll never be able to
finish the year's programme.

198
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,999
There's no sense in complaining.

199
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,315
We have to find
our own solution.

200
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,559
Because if we manage
to get our diplomas,

201
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,516
they won't be diplomas for
the principal or head.

202
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,031
They'll be our diplomas.

203
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,870
Let's pool our energy

204
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,591
to attain our goal.

205
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,992
“Misfortune leads to good
fortune, ° they say.

206
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:39,075
And so we've decided that we
need to quickly find a house

207
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,438
where we can prepare for the
National Exam in peace.

208
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,911
Here's how you can join...

209
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,438
The full cost

210
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,114
is $25 each.

211
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,319
Of the $25,

212
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,076
each person has to
pay $10 in advance.

213
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,870
It's the deposit on the house.

214
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,556
It's too much!

215
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,033
You're exaggerating!

216
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,400
One person at a time.

217
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,997
Our families don't
have a lot of money...

218
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,833
Don't forget that!

219
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,200
I'm funding myself.

220
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,351
I can't afford $25.

221
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,354
Make it a bit less, please.

222
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,590
Let's make a list of the
people who want to come

223
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,996
and we'll know how
many are interested.

224
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:52,391
Then we can set a reasonable
amount for each one to pay.

225
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,077
A list won't be any use.

226
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,476
People make promises but
then they don't pay.

227
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,032
We may as well carry on
debating this issue.

228
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,635
No.

229
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,675
We can't keep talking
indefinitely.

230
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,911
We need a final decision here.

231
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,960
It's an individual choice.

232
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,070
Those who don't agree
can stay at home.

233
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,036
Those who want to
follow us have to pay.

234
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,157
I have a big pirogue
for you two.

235
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,430
Only 3,500 francs.

236
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,359
We'll take the public
pirogue for 200.

237
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,957
I can take you for 2,000.

238
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,750
- We'll take the public one.
- With a camera?

239
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,234
We have no money.

240
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,157
I'll take you across for 2,000.

241
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,709
No, I'll take the
public pirogue.

242
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,917
- With that crowd?
- Yes, for 200.

243
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,197
My friends and I have decided

244
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,352
to find a house where we
can prepare for the Exam.

245
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,955
There'll be a lot of us there.

246
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,837
Not so many at first but
a lot more at the end.

247
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,759
There might be problems.

248
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,479
When you live with
strangers for two months,

249
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,194
a lot of things can happen.

250
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,709
That's why

251
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,717
I want to be under your protection
so nothing happens to me.

252
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,231
Give him the money.

253
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,713
You know how much it is?
It hasn't changed.

254
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,319
Put it on the ground.

255
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,758
Follow me.

256
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,990
Got a hammer?

257
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,279
He's a burglar!

258
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,116
Don't try this at home.

259
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,753
Mind the electric wiring.

260
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,793
This can be a bedroom.

261
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,114
That's up to you. But
mind the wiring.

262
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,477
We just need a place to
spread out our mattresses.

263
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,912
We won't touch the wiring.

264
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:16,914
We just want to sleep at
night and study all day.

265
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,637
This is for the shower.

266
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,953
Question: calculate
the inverse function.

267
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,433
Here we have the equation.

268
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,638
We need to find the inverse.

269
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,234
For the inverse of any equation,

270
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,677
we just need to change
these two values.

271
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,956
Because they are two
different values.

272
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,719
We do what we call
a permutation.

273
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,240
That gives us:

274
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,914
X minus one

275
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,315
equals Y minus one.

276
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,354
Congratulations.

277
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,115
I'd like a kiss.

278
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,152
You'll get one tomorrow

279
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,275
We're going to pray now.

280
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,914
Girls, put your headscarves on.

281
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,909
Dearly beloved!

282
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,152
We're here to study but
we're nothing without God.

283
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,552
The devil won't let
us succeed easily.

284
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,950
That's why we'll fight him

285
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,392
and neutralize him
with our prayers.

286
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:20,030
In the name of Jesus
Christ, let us pray!

287
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,075
Jesus, do something.

288
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,558
Do something...

289
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,073
Lord, you give us
intelligence...

290
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,113
Give me a diploma...

291
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,355
Help me to succeed...

292
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,079
Can we come in?

293
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,398
Here's our papa!

294
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,869
This papa isn't mean.

295
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,354
The skilled director!

296
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,399
Papa is good!

297
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,755
A kind papa!

298
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,474
No male-female equality?

299
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,556
- There isn't a mum...
- They're inside.

300
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,237
- They're cooking?
- Yes.

301
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,309
They're here. They'll
join us soon.

302
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,116
Have a seat!

303
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,679
So, tell us what
you're doing here.

304
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,590
First off,

305
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,639
we've come here...

306
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,195
to study.

307
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,240
Our lesson plan is up there.

308
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,755
The timetable is there too.

309
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,430
Above it, the house rules.

310
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,590
- Where's the timetable?
- On that piece of card.

311
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,436
- With the rules above?
- Yes.

312
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,711
On listening to you, the first
point is what struck us.

313
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,593
You're here to study.

314
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,392
That's a good answer.

315
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,991
Carry on like that. Stick
to your timetable...

316
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,439
And get ready.

317
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,794
Every day,

318
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,438
the National Exam
gets a little closer.

319
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,837
I nearly forgot...

320
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,154
Some students haven't
finished paying the fees yet.

321
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,518
Why do you put spokes in
our wheels like that?

322
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,791
You've crippled us.

323
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,398
Your teachers do a bad
job because of that.

324
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,838
We have lists for each class...

325
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,111
Some students haven't
paid anything at all.

326
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:58,152
Omeleke, for instance, Osisemo...
To name just two.

327
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,518
It means you've
studied for free!

328
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,995
- Can I say something?
- Yes.

329
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,754
We want to give our opinion.

330
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,999
Let's take a subject
like Philosophy.

331
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,517
This year, we only studied
three philosophers.

332
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,031
Three philosophers.

333
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,196
All the others, the second
part of the course...

334
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,560
we never studied them.
How can we revise?

335
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,236
If the exam': on
them, what do we do?

336
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,910
Pedagogy. same thing.
The optional classes...

337
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,080
- Biology too - Don't
mention Biology.

338
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,239
History, English, French...

339
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,274
We've had it in all
those subjects.

340
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:52,233
In the whole year, only one
teacher finished his course,

341
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,233
the Didactics teacher.

342
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,309
All the others... a disaster!

343
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:03,273
We're trying to get the
textbooks from friends.

344
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,510
Honestly,

345
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,077
we don't know how to
explain to each other

346
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,999
things that we don't understand!

347
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,475
To address that key question,

348
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:23,718
I think that each time I
came to your classes,

349
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,955
I kept telling you:
when there's a problem,

350
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,994
come to the office.

351
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,071
The way I run things,

352
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:40,594
I've always asked teachers
to complete the programme.

353
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,671
After all, the programme
is the basis for the exam.

354
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,192
But there are mercenaries.

355
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,475
They're teachers of course
but mercenaries too.

356
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,910
A mercenary is someone
with a personal goal.

357
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,239
He doesn't see the
interest of what you do.

358
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,679
- He sees his own interest.
- His personal interest.

359
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:09,999
Calm down!

360
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,996
The desire to succeed is yours.

361
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,599
70% of the effort needed
to succeed comes from you.

362
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:24,151
And it's a good thing to have left
your homes to come and live here.

363
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,117
Thank you.

364
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,877
I'd like to tell you, as
the school authorities...

365
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:39,239
Really... We've been
sacrificed this year.

366
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,158
But do something for
future classes.

367
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,792
Help them, please!

368
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:01,193
We're going to have a
reading from Proverbs 8,

369
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,678
verse 14.

370
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,036
"Success belongs to me...
Intelligence is mine...

371
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:13,913
Strength is mine." Amen.

372
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:23,992
That's why I take an interest in
youngsters sitting the National Exam.

373
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,439
When I read that verse
for the first time,

374
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,231
I told myself,

375
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,354
"Yes, young people must
understand that verse

376
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,274
if they want to succeed."

377
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,998
Many who haven't
understood that verse

378
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:50,230
waste their time looking here
and there for intelligence.

379
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,312
Some spend their
nights in cemeteries,

380
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:03,439
other consult marabouts...

381
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:10,155
And others still, with their
parents, follow all kinds of paths

382
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,755
to find success!

383
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,670
Yet the only place to
go in order to succeed

384
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,359
is the church!

385
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,598
I'm going to ask you
to bring me your pens.

386
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,354
I'll pray for that.

387
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,751
You know, a pen

388
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:40,633
is what allows you to put in uniting
what you have in your mind.

389
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,951
God can give you intelligence

390
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:50,076
but if you can't put it down
on paper, you won't succeed.

391
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:54,198
That's why we want to
work on these pens

392
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,959
with powerful prayers

393
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,471
before returning them to you.

394
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,873
When you go to sit the
Exam with these pens,

395
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,234
you'll be able to
reproduce exactly

396
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,750
what God will put in your minds.

397
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,229
Write your name on a piece of
paper and slip it inside the pen.

398
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,390
That will avoid any confusion.

399
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,910
Those who are ready
may come forward now.

400
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,560
Thank you for welcoming us here.

401
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:31,432
We tried to come sooner
but we couldn't.

402
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,834
There's too much to do these
days at the university.

403
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,278
As a former student,

404
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,550
I can tell you

405
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,869
no one can pass the National
Exam without cheating.

406
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,598
My friend and I were
top of our class

407
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:59,194
throughout high school.

408
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:04,271
I regularly had the top place.

409
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,840
But on the 1st day of the
exam, out of 20 questions,

410
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,319
I only had one correct answer.

411
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,559
I couldn't believe it!

412
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,151
Just think! The best
student in the class...

413
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,194
Only one correct answer...

414
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,918
If I didn't cheat what
would become of me?

415
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:32,439
Even so, I'd been top of the
class since primary school.

416
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:38,791
That's just to show you how
complicated this exam is.

417
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,599
The people who set it know that.

418
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,913
So they allow the
answers to leak out.

419
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,077
That's how my friend got 70 %.

420
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,279
I got 63 %. Others,
more than 70 %...

421
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:58,717
if you haven't found anyone
to help you on that level,

422
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,034
we're ready to do it.

423
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,312
It's like a legacy.

424
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,749
This year, we're
going to help you.

425
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,789
Next year, it'll be your
turn to help your brothers.

426
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:20,196
It was the same in our day... Our
elders helped us to succeed.

427
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:26,551
Yesterday it was us, today it's you,
tomorrow, it will be your brothers...

428
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,395
And so on.

429
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,358
If you agree, we're
ready to help you.

430
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,034
Hi, is Modé here?

431
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,429
No, he's gone out.

432
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,549
I'm selling this phone.

433
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,557
How much do you want?

434
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,076
How much are you offering?

435
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,275
- You're the seller...
- Give me $8.

436
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,198
That's a lot.

437
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:38,635
- Phone for sale, boss.
- Not interested.

438
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,234
- How much is it?
- $10.

439
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,710
That's a lot.

440
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,111
Hello, Auntie.

441
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,873
I've made 5,000 francs.
I've sold my phone.

442
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,399
I need another 6,000 francs
to pay the exam fees.

443
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,511
I haven't sold anything yet.

444
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:48,432
You haven't sold anything?
How will I pay my fees?

445
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,749
Look at all this... There
aren't many customers today.

446
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,153
"The righteous will
live by faith."

447
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,874
Living God,

448
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,877
I entrust these young
people to Your hands.

449
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,918
They're not here for me.

450
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,433
They have come to You who
hands out diplomas...

451
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,276
My God!

452
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,440
Lord! I've done my share...

453
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,316
It's Your turn to act now...

454
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,749
I'm talking to the demon that
has taken over this brain.

455
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,550
Out with you!

456
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,239
Out!

457
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,079
Hold her!

458
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,151
Receive the fire!

459
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,677
Leave her mind!

460
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:52,637
Out!

461
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,311
Who are you?

462
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,637
Who is inside this body?

463
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,200
Many of us!

464
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,557
- Who are you?
- Men.

465
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,197
What are you doing in this body?

466
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:13,038
We don't want her
to get her diploma.

467
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,756
Where are you from?

468
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,794
From her family...

469
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,873
Listen!

470
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,870
She has found refuge with the
One who created intelligence.

471
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:32,040
You can no longer influence her.

472
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:36,230
I render void and ineffective
all the decisions

473
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,791
that you have made
about her life.

474
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,552
I destroy all your plans...

475
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,440
All your schemes...

476
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,714
All your schemes...

477
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,159
That's it.

478
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,958
Everyone is ready.
They're waiting for you.

479
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,679
Quiet, please!

480
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,760
Everyone has a piece of paper?

481
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,833
Get out your pens.

482
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,793
I'm about to do
something very risky.

483
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:55,436
I'm doing it for the
good of everyone here.

484
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,837
So be quiet or I'll stop.

485
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,399
No! We'll be quiet... Go on!

486
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,153
Series number 1...

487
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,076
Question 2...

488
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:18,434
First president.

489
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,036
Series 1, question 2.
Reference: first president.

490
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,795
Four... One... Two...

491
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,759
Series 2...

492
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,438
Reference: second president.

493
01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:00,159
Six... Five...

494
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:12,997
To know the number
of your series,

495
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,472
the first thing to do on
getting the questionnaire,

496
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,115
is to find these clues...

497
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:22,876
If you find "1st president",
you have series 1.

498
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:26,311
"2nd president" is series 2.

499
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,958
"3rd president"... And so on.

500
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,838
My brothers, we're
here for a reason.

501
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:41,555
You want to succeed, he wants
to, him over there too...

502
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:47,712
Everyone here wants to make
it to help his or her family.

503
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:55,760
So, please! Let's not look
for problems among us!

504
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:01,236
Don't be in a hurry to
use these bits of paper.

505
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:05,235
You have to be very
careful in the exam room.

506
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,230
If a supervisor catches you
with your piece of paper,

507
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:16,151
all you can do is swallow it.

508
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:26,551
No one will open up your stomach
to go looking for it inside.

509
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,792
If he won't back down, get
angry, threaten him...

510
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:40,550
Do all you can to scare him...

511
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:46,471
But if you get caught
with the evidence...

512
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:51,952
that will be your problem.
I'll deny everything.

513
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,909
So be careful.

514
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,880
Let's not put our
lives in danger.

515
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:24,190
Lycée Mapendano National
Diploma Exam Centre 1

516
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,160
The number of exam
exercise books is limited.

517
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,479
We have 351 candidates

518
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,831
and exactly 351 exam books.

519
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,510
If you damage yours,
that's your problem.

520
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,157
You've all learned how to
fill out the electronic grid.

521
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,918
If you damage your book,
that's your problem.

522
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,751
Today's exam only
lasts two hours.

523
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,429
You've seen that on the schedule

524
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,711
that I put up yesterday.

525
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,795
Therefore, no toilet
breaks today.

526
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,916
Relieve yourselves
before going in.

527
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,673
Once you're in, you stay!

528
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,353
Inside, do not speak
to the supervisor!

529
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:31,238
Inside, give the supervisor
eight sheets of paper.

530
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:40,436
We weren't told about that!

531
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:51,549
National Diploma Exam Centre 2

532
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,516
My respects, Excellency!

533
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:30,272
- How are you?
- Hello, Excellency.

534
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:35,034
Hello.

535
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,194
How are you?

536
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,755
Very nice strongboxes. Are
they like this every year?

537
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,274
We've improved them...

538
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:43,954
to improve exam security.

539
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,153
- Enter the code now.
- You have it?

540
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,797
Good security!

541
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,798
This is...

542
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,118
That's the exam for
the short cycle.

543
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:35,071
So this is what I give
to Madam Minister.

544
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,115
Thank you.

545
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:47,078
His Excellency the Provincial
Governor authorizes

546
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:50,518
the head of this centre
to lead the students

547
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:55,239
to their exam rooms.

548
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:54,232
The exam went badly for me...

549
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,037
They'll refund my money.

550
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,591
Don't say that... It's
all your fault...

551
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,350
You took our phones
and forced us

552
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,598
to work with no one but
your crook of a friend.

553
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,552
You killed us!

554
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:14,236
You're going to give
us our money back!

555
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,554
Our telephones too...

556
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:39,874
I was so confident this morning.

557
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:46,355
Luckily for me, I had a
back-up plan, otherwise...

558
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:52,069
I had wagered everything on
their shitty bit of paper...

559
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,751
They'll refund my money.

560
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:00,431
That gang of crooks is
going to hear from us!

561
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:10,791
- It's getting off to a bad start!
- I swear...

562
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:15,632
Take your pieces of paper...
And give us back our money.

563
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:21,237
Here's the real leak.
Unfortunately, I got it too late...

564
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,990
You were already in the exam.

565
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:26,914
We want to hear your
crooked friend, not you.

566
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,151
I'll call him...

567
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,352
He won't have all the money.

568
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,953
- Shako, did we give him his money?
- No.

569
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:45,230
You're playing with
people's lives.

570
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,800
The whole city had the
real leak, except us.

571
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:55,434
- We've been swindled!
- Let me explain...

572
01:12:56,120 --> 01:13:00,398
They stepped up the
security measures...

573
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,674
Each code series was inverted.

574
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:09,035
Everything was messed
up because of that.

575
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:12,552
We didn't realize until
it was too late.

576
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:18,553
I tried to get a message to
you but it was impossible.

577
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:24,239
But you told us your source
was the most reliable one.

578
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,951
So what happened?

579
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,636
We want our money,
not explanations.

580
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:34,791
Give us back our money!

581
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:36,959
This is theft!

582
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,551
My brothers...

583
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,916
Listen to me, please.

584
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,597
We all know...

585
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:55,518
that today's exam...

586
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:00,913
didn't go well.

587
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,555
You've done a lot
of talking today.

588
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,391
It was unbearable!

589
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,111
Yes, it happened. But
it wasn't my fault.

590
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,592
It didn't just happen to us.
Everywhere...

591
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,158
You didn't try asking
other students.

592
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,994
You preferred to yell at me.

593
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:25,477
If you had, you'd have
understood what happened.

594
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,439
Anyone who wants...

595
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,432
to get their $5 back

596
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:42,358
can come to see me after
the exam tomorrow

597
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,437
No, now.

598
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:50,153
- I said tomorrow after the exam.
- No, today.

599
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:54,952
The most important thing now,

600
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,318
is...

601
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:04,636
is...

602
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,994
the next exam.

603
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:11,031
It's an optional course
with 30 questions.

604
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,830
We need to find 30
correct answers

605
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:20,600
to make up for today's disaster.

606
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:25,720
Tonight, there have been
many leaks like yesterday.

607
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:30,473
But, yesterday, our haste
caused us to make mistakes.

608
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:33,479
This time, trust me.

609
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,595
There won't be any problem.

610
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:47,637
Let's start with the leaks
that are doing the rounds

611
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:50,993
before I give you mine.

612
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:56,154
We've already copied
all the other leaks.

613
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,637
- You have them?
- Yes.

614
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,350
Give us your version now.

615
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:03,557
It's already late.

616
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,835
S3...

617
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:10,753
Q2...

618
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:16,550
Touch...

619
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,030
Like on the board.

620
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:20,870
Series 3, question 2...

621
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,470
Touch...

622
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:24,352
Five...

623
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:26,318
Five...

624
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,358
Two...

625
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:30,631
Four...

626
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:32,352
Three...

627
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:34,518
Two...

628
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,437
It worked!

629
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:25,193
We have to celebrate!

630
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,400
You're a real leader!

631
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,150
You did a great job, Chairman!

632
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,433
You're the best.

633
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,389
Two months later

634
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:48,913
I Passed!

635
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:53,310
I'm happy! I have my diploma!
God helped me...

636
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:57,238
It's over... I got 80%!

637
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,796
- Well, Joel?
- I haven't had my results yet.

638
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,956
- I'm confident...
- Keep me posted.

639
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,870
Check your phone. The
results have been released.

640
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:25,513
Here we go...

641
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,469
I've sent a text message.

642
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,797
The answer...

643
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:43,473
What percentage did he get?

644
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:47,796
57... 57... 57 %!

645
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:35,393
What percentage?

646
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,757
What did I get?

647
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,036
59 “A.

648
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:50,631
Help me to check mine.

649
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,359
You've got it!

650
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,994
Give me the last
figure of your code.

651
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,118
I've sent a text message.

652
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,351
Nothing.

653
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,111
Chin up... There's no news yet.

654
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:32,120
Chin up, Joël...
Honoré, your turn.

655
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,039
The answer...

656
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:43,513
All the people working here have
had to give up their studies.

657
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:47,271
But you keep going.

658
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:51,840
This failure isn't the
end of your life.

659
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:56,315
You're young, you
have to resist...

660
01:28:57,080 --> 01:29:00,596
If you give up, you'll
be stuck here forever.

661
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:04,756
Pull yourself together...

662
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:09,519
Next year, you'll
sit the exam again.

663
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:14,716
Take heart, my friend...
That's life.

664
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,639
Take up your studies again.

665
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:08,920
To my parents

666
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:13,192
