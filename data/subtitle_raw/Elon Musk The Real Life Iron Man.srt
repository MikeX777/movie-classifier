1
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,015
This is a difficult
thing that we're doing.

2
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,684
It's a hard thing,
it's a new thing,

3
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:54,888
and you know, I'd hope
that you would cheer us on.

4
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:28,989
Three,
two, one, and lift off!

5
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,261
I think this is
a really good milestone

6
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:34,728
for the future of space flight.

7
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:37,431
You know, I think it's another
step towards the stars.

8
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:42,136
Elon Musk is not
your average tech billionaire.

9
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,438
He's one of the most
intriguing entrepreneurs

10
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:46,240
in business today.

11
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:49,410
The man behind PayPal
is taking on the giants

12
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,912
of the aerospace and
motor industries,

13
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,847
along with the oil corporations,

14
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:56,617
the energy utility
companies, and winning.

15
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,687
Elon Musk
is a visionary,

16
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,490
someone who comes along
perhaps once a century,

17
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:05,959
who is actually changing
the way we function

18
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,661
and the way we
look at the world.

19
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,797
Back then,

20
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,465
people were still afraid
to buy books online,

21
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:13,967
so putting together a
financial services suite

22
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:17,037
on the internet was a
rather revolutionary idea,

23
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,173
and that company turned
out to be PayPal,

24
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:20,808
the online payment service.

25
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,643
It's one thing to run a company

26
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,545
that's worth a billion dollars.

27
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,880
Elon Musk has four.

28
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:29,550
My personal ideology is
kind of split right now

29
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:32,486
between trying to be helpful
on Earth related stuff,

30
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,887
which is sustainable energy,

31
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:36,357
and then trying to
advance space technology,

32
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,926
so we can establish a
self-sustaining city on Mars.

33
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:43,964
From AI, to disrupting
the car industry,

34
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,299
to SolarCity.

35
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,468
I mean how many
other people can say,

36
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,002
I have my own rocket company?

37
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:49,837
Not many.

38
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:53,341
- In terms of space,
Elon has completely changed

39
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:54,808
how we think about everything.

40
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,810
When you look at
what SpaceX has done

41
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,412
with their reusable rockets,

42
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:02,416
we are seeing science fiction
of the 1950s coming to life.

43
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,519
Rockets land as they
always were meant to do.

44
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,655
It's really trying to land
on a postage stamp there.

45
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,390
Astonishingly difficult.

46
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,359
So, Mars does beckon.

47
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:13,594
I am very convinced

48
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,696
that this is gonna
happen in my lifetime.

49
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,198
- If you look
at Tesla alone,

50
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:20,000
has changed the way
that automobiles

51
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,769
will be forever in the future.

52
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,372
He has truly broken
down the wall

53
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:26,173
that was impossible to break,

54
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,075
and now we're in
a situation where

55
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:29,710
all of the big car companies

56
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:32,346
are switching massively
to electric cars,

57
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:37,050
and that is a revolution
done by one man.

58
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,553
He's almost like
a real life Iron Man

59
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:40,788
in what he's doing.

60
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,690
There's a lot more
that will happen

61
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,191
before his story is over.

62
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,195
So, I think we just get
to watch, and be excited,

63
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,663
and see what comes next.

64
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:55,603
A lot of people think that
successful entrepreneurs

65
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,738
are just happened to be in the
right place at the right time

66
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,707
with the right product
or right service.

67
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,474
That's untrue.

68
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,777
Why are they not
content with $25 million

69
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:05,313
when they sell
their first company,

70
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:08,416
then go on to a second company
for another $50 million,

71
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:11,585
or a third company when they
fail and go into another one.

72
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:14,922
Serial entrepreneurs are driven.

73
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:17,891
They're psychologically driven,

74
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,761
and it's usually to do with
something in their childhood.

75
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:31,739
Elon Reeve Musk
was born in Pretoria in 1971,

76
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,975
the son of a Canadian mother
and South African father.

77
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,813
Elon grew up in South Africa,

78
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:43,951
and he had a very
unfettered upbringing.

79
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,787
He has said that he was
raised basically by books

80
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,357
and occasionally nannies.

81
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,259
His mother and father
have two other kids.

82
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,595
They're, he has a younger
brother and sister,

83
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,931
Kimball and Tuska, but it
seemed like Elon didn't have

84
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,433
a lot of adult supervision.

85
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:03,671
He said that he was basically
out there building explosives,

86
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:07,975
and learning about conduction
with very little supervision.

87
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,711
He had a passion
for engineering,

88
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:13,146
and obviously physics
and the sciences as well.

89
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:19,353
Musk attended
Waterkloof Primary School,

90
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:21,455
and after his parents divorced,

91
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:24,358
nine year old Elon went
to live with his father.

92
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,363
Elon at one stage
in his childhood,

93
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:31,198
after his parents divorced,

94
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:33,801
says that he felt sorry for
his dad living by himself,

95
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:36,136
so he opted to go and
live with his dad.

96
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,139
That, he later called
a huge mistake.

97
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,508
He's been on record saying,

98
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,309
he didn't have a great
relationship with his father.

99
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,744
He's notably said some really,

100
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,979
really hard things
about his dad.

101
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,650
It sounds like it was a
really awful situation.

102
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,251
His father was an engineer,

103
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,822
and Elon says that a lot
of his engineering nous

104
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,524
came from his father,

105
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,993
and his father had some
issues according to Elon,

106
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,096
but what he did have
was a very incisive

107
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,532
engineering background.

108
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,900
As disturbing as
Elon's relationship

109
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:09,503
with his dad seemed to be,

110
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:12,673
Elon's relationship with his
mother appears to be very good

111
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,508
and went from
strength to strength.

112
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:17,277
I think his mother is probably
the ultimate optimist.

113
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,846
She's lovely.

114
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,048
She's really something.

115
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,118
Open the New York Times,
there's Maye, it's great.

116
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,854
I've been modeling
for 50 years, ha!

117
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:31,391
So, you just have to just
keep on going, and be nice,

118
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,761
and available, and be surprised

119
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:36,029
when you suddenly become
mother of the bride,

120
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,798
and then grandmother.

121
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,733
Elon's Mom has been
very supportive of him

122
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:40,934
over the years.

123
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,269
She's constantly
outspoken on Twitter

124
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,771
telling us the wonders of Elon,

125
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,973
and she's clearly
very proud of him.

126
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,141
Maye Musk is an
incredible woman.

127
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,943
At something like 69,

128
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:52,546
she's called an "It
Girl" by Vanity Fair.

129
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,216
She's an in-demand model
who's doing campaigns

130
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,986
for big major brands
all over the world.

131
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,589
She's one of the most
glamorous older women

132
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:02,923
you will ever see.

133
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:08,596
Despite the fact that Elon
says he tried repeatedly,

134
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,997
again and again and again

135
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,567
to try and repair his
relationship with his father,

136
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,435
at this stage he's
just given up,

137
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:18,739
because he doesn't believe
his dad is capable of change.

138
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,408
He's talked openly
about how as a child

139
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,076
he spent a lot of time alone.

140
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,345
He says he can still remember

141
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,648
the sound of an empty house,

142
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,449
footsteps far off
in the distance,

143
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:31,619
and he never ever
wanted that again.

144
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:42,329
My own view is the really
stellar entrepreneurs,

145
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,765
their life experiences
particularly in childhood

146
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,501
are the determinant of
their success later on.

147
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:49,670
If you look at their early
childhood experiences,

148
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:53,206
you will find a number
of adverse events.

149
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,610
Substantial adverse events
like school bullying,

150
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,345
or being rejected.

151
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:01,481
These events drive you, you
now need to prove something.

152
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,617
You wanna gain control
of a world again,

153
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:06,319
you didn't have control
of when you were younger,

154
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:09,222
and moving toward a top job,

155
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:12,826
being an entrepreneur,
being a CEO, gives you power,

156
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,829
gives you strength,
gives you control,

157
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,531
the thing they never had
when they were younger,

158
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:21,902
so I think that's a driving
force in many entrepreneurs.

159
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,640
Elon Musk attended

160
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:28,876
Bryanston High
School in Pretoria,

161
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:30,878
where he thrived academically.

162
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,583
He had quite a tough upbringing.

163
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:38,151
There are some reports
of bullying as well.

164
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:42,489
You know, any child that
shows that sort of intellect,

165
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,594
and interest might come under
the glare of the bullies.

166
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:49,362
He was even hospitalized
after one particular fight.

167
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,732
He was a nerd.

168
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,266
He was bullied at school.

169
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,836
There was one point he was
even knocked unconscious.

170
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,171
You know, it wasn't obvious

171
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,407
that he was a marketing
genius at that point.

172
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,614
Elon took on wrestling classes,

173
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,116
and a bit of judo in an
attempt to compensate

174
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,451
with a bit of added physicality,

175
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,886
and then he grew
up a little bit,

176
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,554
got a growth spurt,
got a bit taller,

177
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:17,858
and really took the
bullies head on.

178
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,130
After spending
three years at Bryanston High,

179
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:26,233
Elon attended Pretoria
High School for boys.

180
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,905
Elon attended Boys High
from 1986 until 1988,

181
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:34,541
which is the year
he matriculated.

182
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,143
He excelled in science,

183
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:39,312
and he also excelled
in computer studies.

184
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:42,449
He, in fact, got a
distinction for both science

185
00:09:42,482 --> 00:09:44,752
and computer studies in 1988.

186
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,120
As I do recall his grades,

187
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,989
'cause I have them
in my mark book,

188
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:52,626
and he was definitely
top of the science class.

189
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,895
I've taught many
boys over the years,

190
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,397
and Elon did stick in my mind.

191
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,566
You know, I can't tell
you where every boy sat,

192
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,234
but I can remember Elon

193
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,836
sitting at the back
of the classroom

194
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,404
getting on with his work.

195
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,639
He wasn't one of the boys

196
00:10:05,673 --> 00:10:08,075
that wanted attention
all the time.

197
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,443
We always take a lot of
pride in all of the boys,

198
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:11,979
but from a personal
point of view

199
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,281
having taught Elon science,

200
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,084
I'd like to think that
I made a small input

201
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,752
in his formative years.

202
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:21,154
I've read would
like to go to Mars.

203
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,691
I'm hoping he'll do
that a lot sooner,

204
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:26,694
but Star Trek style so
he can invite me there.

205
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,265
Elon Musk
was always different.

206
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,002
His entrepreneurial
ventures started early.

207
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:41,041
In 1984, a science fiction
inspired tech success

208
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,976
gave a hint of his future

209
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,412
when he sold his first
commercial software.

210
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,549
He started working on
computers at the age of 10,

211
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,952
working very hard,
and being very clever

212
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,987
in developing programs.

213
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,456
He develops a video
game called Blastar.

214
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,327
He famously sold this to
a PC magazine for $500.

215
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,395
Elon was asked about

216
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:04,464
what sets him apart
from other people,

217
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,966
and he himself said,

218
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:10,170
there were things that were
very obvious to him growing up

219
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,072
that other people
didn't understand,

220
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,473
how conduction works,

221
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:17,077
how light and wires make
a light switch go on,

222
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,480
things that to him were
immediately clear and obvious,

223
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,682
whereas other people
didn't automatically,

224
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,484
especially when they're like 14,

225
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,253
understand what was going on.

226
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:27,755
He played a lot of chess,

227
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:30,090
and as a result of that was
always sort of thinking ahead.

228
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,392
In chess you play to
think moves ahead.

229
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,261
So, even when he was younger,

230
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,696
he was looking at ideas for

231
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,166
what might make a good
business in the short term,

232
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,369
and then what could be part
of a grand plan further on.

233
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,010
After graduating
from high school,

234
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,546
Musk briefly attended the
University of Pretoria

235
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,950
before deciding to
leave South Africa.

236
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:59,552
The story of Elon Musk's
wealth and his rise

237
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:02,455
is tied up in part with
the American dream.

238
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,891
It was always ingrained to him

239
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:06,026
that South Africa wasn't
where he was going to achieve

240
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:06,927
the ambitions he had.

241
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,461
He wanted to be in America.

242
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:10,430
He wanted to be a
part of that scene.

243
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,365
Initially he couldn't
go directly to America.

244
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,301
He actually had to
go through Canada.

245
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,307
Elon spent
two years studying

246
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,810
at Queen's University
in Ontario.

247
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:26,746
He funded his own degrees
in Canada and the US

248
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,549
by getting scholarships
and working part time,

249
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,552
so he didn't have a huge
amount of money behind him.

250
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,422
He has a famous university
paper where he talks about

251
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,557
wanting to conquer different
areas of the world,

252
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,759
and those included the
internet, space exploration,

253
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:41,829
solar energy,
artificial intelligence,

254
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,763
and brain learning
interfaces as well.

255
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:52,005
Elon Musk married his
childhood sweetheart.

256
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,606
They met at university.

257
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,443
Her name was Justine and she
was absolutely beautiful,

258
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,744
and on their first date

259
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,312
they were supposed to
go out for ice cream.

260
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:02,816
She actually said yes, and
then basically ditched him,

261
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,452
and went off to do
some studying instead.

262
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,988
He didn't take no for an answer.

263
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:08,956
He pursued her.

264
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:10,824
He continued to pursue her,

265
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:12,659
and even after Elon left

266
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:15,095
the university he
attended with Justine

267
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,529
and moved to Horton
Business School,

268
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:19,666
he still sent her
roses regularly.

269
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,169
When Elon Musk is
interested in you,

270
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,337
I think he comes on
like a steam train

271
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:27,107
or an electric
steam train perhaps,

272
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,109
but Elon Musk is unstoppable.

273
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,710
He sees what he wants,

274
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:34,114
and he does everything
he needs to do to get it.

275
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,650
He's like that in business
and he's like that in love.

276
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,292
Having
completed degrees

277
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,060
in business and physics,

278
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:51,631
in 1995 Musk abandoned
the PhD at Stanford

279
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,666
and headed for Silicon Valley.

280
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,305
He famously dropped
out of his third degree

281
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,974
at Stanford University in
California after just two days.

282
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:02,175
And, he had launched a company

283
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:04,577
with his brother
Kimball called Zip2,

284
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:07,580
and it was effectively a
form of online Yellow Pages

285
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,516
that he sold to
newspapers at the time.

286
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,485
And, he struck lucky when
the company was bought.

287
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,088
They actually ended up
selling it to Compaq,

288
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:17,824
for about $307 million,

289
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,659
when he was only 27 years old.

290
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,695
He made about $22
million back then,

291
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,331
which is wonderful,
an awful lot of money,

292
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,832
but in typical Elon style,

293
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:30,337
he recycled half of that
into his next venture,

294
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,773
and which eventually
ended up becoming PayPal.

295
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,843
Having disrupted

296
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,447
the traditional paper
advertising industry with Zip2,

297
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,218
Musk's next venture took on
the global financial market.

298
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:46,786
So, he worked to setup a company

299
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:48,055
called X.com,

300
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,723
which is the precursor
to what is now PayPal.

301
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,125
X.com was supposed to be

302
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,562
a full services financial
services business.

303
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,198
So, it sounds sort
of archaic now,

304
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,799
but back at the time
putting together

305
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,602
a financial services
suite on the internet

306
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,105
was a rather revolutionary idea.

307
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,707
He had one internet
win under his belt.

308
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,410
So, it was not
especially challenging

309
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:14,081
to bring on new engineers,
or new business people

310
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:15,315
who wanted to work on something

311
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:16,749
that seemed very exciting

312
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:19,486
with someone who had
already won already once.

313
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,289
So, that was a big
feather in his cap.

314
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,124
It was, I think,
more challenging

315
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:29,162
to persuade outside investors
that it was a good idea,

316
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,764
'cause they were not
swayed by one win.

317
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,901
It was not enough to buy public
opinion in Silicon Valley.

318
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,436
The jury was still sort of out

319
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:40,107
on whether he was genius
or crazy or just a big ego,

320
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,908
or how it was all
gonna play out,

321
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,411
but he invested
$10 or $12 million

322
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,146
of his own money into X.com,

323
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,748
so we didn't need a whole lot
of money right off the bat.

324
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,550
He sort of took
care of all of that.

325
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,753
Musk
was revolutionary

326
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,023
in his strategy at X.com,

327
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:58,791
gifting new customers
cash rewards,

328
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,828
and creating peer-to-peer
payment systems.

329
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:04,431
My initial impressions
were just that he was

330
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,666
very focused and very passionate

331
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:09,436
on what he was about to do.

332
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,638
It seemed very clear early on

333
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:15,142
that Elon was not playing by
the standard book of life,

334
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,277
or business, or anything else.

335
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,214
So, I was just gonna
be along for the ride.

336
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:25,152
At the beginning Elon
wasn't easy to read at all,

337
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,387
mostly because you
just had no idea

338
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,389
how he was going to
react to anything.

339
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,291
I had no experience with someone

340
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,126
who thought the way that he did,

341
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,627
or talked the way that he did,

342
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,963
or had as much confidence
about what he was doing,

343
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,498
and in himself as he did.

344
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:43,470
It was so foreign to me as
someone who grew up in Iowa,

345
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,205
or maybe it's
foreign to everyone.

346
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:46,839
I don't know.

347
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,478
PayPal was voted

348
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:55,815
one of the 10 worst
business ideas in 1999.

349
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,917
Elon Musk was instrumental

350
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,154
in the company's focus on
a global payment system,

351
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:04,324
which would change the
course of the internet.

352
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,025
People probably know
him mostly from PayPal.

353
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,162
That's when he really first
came to public consciousness.

354
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:12,165
PayPal was how are we
going to turn finances

355
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,701
into an online transaction?

356
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:15,702
How are we gonna make it easy?

357
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:16,936
How are we gonna make
it more efficient?

358
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,405
It sounds sort of obvious now,

359
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:21,508
but back then people were still
afraid to buy books online,

360
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:25,044
so asking them to put all their
financial data in one place

361
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,347
was not a solid proposition.

362
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,682
The goal of the company
that we were building

363
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,951
was always trying
to do something

364
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,786
very positive for humanity,

365
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,056
and he was thinking about
space, and solar panels,

366
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,558
and all of that way back then.

367
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:42,028
So, we knew that this was
sort of a stepping-stone

368
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,896
on the way to grander dreams.

369
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:47,033
PayPal soon became

370
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,769
the online payment
system of choice,

371
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,571
from a few thousand users,

372
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:55,007
multiplying to more than
a million within months.

373
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,877
The person to person
payment side of things

374
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,581
took off so quickly, we were
gaining traction like crazy,

375
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:04,384
and then the online auction
market took hold of it,

376
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,986
and it blew up into
this huge thing.

377
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,721
We were adding tens of thousands

378
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,056
of new accounts every day,

379
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,925
which at the time was
fairly unprecedented.

380
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:17,264
Elon was very hands-on in
all aspects of the company.

381
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:20,267
It was his money after all
that we were all playing with.

382
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,736
So, I think when it's your
money on the table, you have,

383
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,071
it's in your best interests

384
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,674
to be very involved
in all the details.

385
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,645
Everyday was a new
sort of fire, right?

386
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,747
Everyday something
was burning down

387
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,316
that needed to be addressed.

388
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,585
We had a customer
service nightmare

389
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,287
where soon after
launching the service,

390
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,955
we had thousands and thousands
of emails in the queue,

391
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:45,758
because people
didn't understand,

392
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,327
again, the early
days of the internet,

393
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,163
they didn't understand how
to get their money out.

394
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:52,799
And so, they would
freak out, and call in,

395
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:54,634
or email like 12
different times.

396
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,836
So, we have two million
emails in the cue

397
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,105
and we only had 10
customer service people

398
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,940
dedicated to dealing with that.

399
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,343
And so, we really had no idea
what we were going to do.

400
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:06,879
Customer service was enormously
expensive in California.

401
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:09,382
And so, I said you know
this is gonna sound crazy,

402
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,285
but I have a huge extended
family in the Midwest.

403
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,622
I could train them all to
do customer service at home.

404
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,291
Elon laughed at first, and
then a couple of hours later

405
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,793
came back and said all
right, get on a plane.

406
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,530
So, I went out and taught
10 of my family members

407
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,131
how to do customer
service from home,

408
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,400
and then my sister
ended up hiring

409
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:30,970
12 stay at home parents in
a small town in Nebraska

410
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,539
who started all
working from home.

411
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,541
And they were so good
that we ended up building

412
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,009
a customer service center
in Omaha, Nebraska,

413
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,812
which now employs 1800 people,

414
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,414
and that turned out fantastic.

415
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:44,150
We went from zero to a
hundred people in six weeks

416
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,652
out in Omaha,

417
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:49,055
and that was probably the
most challenging thing,

418
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,991
but we were a little
short of options, so.

419
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:58,197
Led by his
passion for perfectionism,

420
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:01,901
determination, and
a heroic work ethic,

421
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,003
Musk has succeeded in markets

422
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,206
that were previously considered
impossible to conquer.

423
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:13,246
He's always had higher
expectations for himself

424
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,547
than he did for other people,

425
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:18,685
so he pushed himself
very, very hard.

426
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,052
There's a lot of pressure on him

427
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,854
because he has a
lot of expectations,

428
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,556
a lot of responsibility

429
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,427
to his shareholders, to the
capital that has sourced,

430
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,762
to his staff, his colleagues,

431
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,364
so there's a lot of demands.

432
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,700
So, you can't just
say you know what?

433
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:34,934
This is all good and great.

434
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,869
I'm just gonna take
six months off.

435
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,272
Why, because I've got 20
billion, so it's okay.

436
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,608
No, it doesn't work like that.

437
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,311
As the stakes get higher,

438
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:45,945
and the more people
that get involved

439
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,914
there's more pressure
on that front,

440
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:52,452
but I think he looks
at it, and turns away.

441
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,457
What drives Elon, what
pushes him, I don't get it,

442
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,992
but he's making
changes in the world,

443
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:02,595
because he doesn't
ever stop and rest.

444
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:05,231
He just keeps going.

445
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,235
Elon Musk is famous for his
work ethic, which is nonstop.

446
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,739
I think he has two modes,
and there's stop and go.

447
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,341
He works around the clock

448
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,142
and he expects everyone
else to do the same.

449
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:19,412
Elon was up all hours
of the night working.

450
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:22,582
He would send emails at
midnight or 1:00 or 2:00 a.m.

451
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,651
and just be very
focused on some problem

452
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:26,152
that we were trying to solve.

453
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:28,287
If you hear stories from
SpaceX in the early days,

454
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,523
people were really struggling
to keep pace with him,

455
00:21:30,557 --> 00:21:31,991
but that's how he works,

456
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,126
and if you can't keep
pace, you're out the door.

457
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:37,163
I thought he was a good boss.

458
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:38,831
It's sort of infamous now

459
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:41,501
that he runs through
PR people very quickly,

460
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:44,771
but at that time, I thought
I was just gonna be like,

461
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,272
a normal PR person.

462
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:50,109
And so, Elon wasn't really
gonna have any of that.

463
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,144
He expected a lot of his people,

464
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:54,313
but we all expected
a lot of each other,

465
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:55,982
and that's how you get it done.

466
00:21:56,983 --> 00:22:00,787
In the culture of startups
the expectation is

467
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,789
that everybody is
working all the time.

468
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,791
You get there at 9:00
or 10:00 in the morning

469
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,793
and not leave
until 9:00 or 10:00

470
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,495
or maybe after that at night.

471
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:11,864
And Elon was definitely working
until midnight every night.

472
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:15,034
That was just what we
did, and it was exciting.

473
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,637
Rarely did anyone complain
about that kind of thing,

474
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,640
'cause you really felt like
you were changing the world.

475
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:26,212
By the year 2000,

476
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:29,081
Musk had married Justine Wilson.

477
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:31,651
He was always
pining for Justine,

478
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,753
and he was still in
Canada at that point.

479
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:36,155
And so, it was lovely
when she came down.

480
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,492
The couple did suffer a
tragedy very early on.

481
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:42,662
Their baby boy was
10 weeks old, Nevada,

482
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,164
when he died suddenly of SIDS.

483
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,501
It was beyond difficult for
both of them to cope with.

484
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,671
Justine immediately sought
IVF, and fertility help,

485
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:55,207
and went on to have five boys,

486
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:58,778
one set of triplets and
one set of twin boys.

487
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:01,280
So, very quickly they went from

488
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,249
having no children
to having five.

489
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:05,418
Justine has written
extensively about

490
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,754
how it caused a strain
in the marriage,

491
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:09,422
as it might do, as it would do,

492
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:13,860
but this tragic event of
losing their infant son

493
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,696
unfortunately didn't
draw the couple closer,

494
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,531
but rather was the
beginning, perhaps,

495
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,900
of what ultimately
would pull them apart.

496
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,037
As PayPal flourished,

497
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:27,106
boardroom troubles dogged Musk.

498
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:30,409
An internal disagreement
with the Board

499
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:34,614
resulted in Elon being
ousted from his own company.

500
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:35,982
There was a time
when Peter Theil

501
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:39,151
and Elon were co-CEOs at PayPal,

502
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:41,721
but there were certain
differences in opinion

503
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:44,323
about the technology and
the branding of the company

504
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:48,227
that led to the vote of no
confidence to oust Elon.

505
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,899
And Elon unfortunately,
was in South Africa.

506
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:55,568
I had just spoken with
him on the phone that day,

507
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:56,903
and he's like how bad is it?

508
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,538
I'm like oh, it's not that bad.

509
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:02,174
And then that night I went
home, and I was laying in bed,

510
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,176
and I started realizing and
started putting together

511
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,413
all the pieces of who I
had seen in the office,

512
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,915
and what was happening,

513
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,751
and at about 10:30 at night
I sat straight up in bed,

514
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,821
and I'm sure I said some
swear word at the ceiling.

515
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:16,523
I got up, and I went
back in the office,

516
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:18,525
and sure enough
everybody was there,

517
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:20,627
and that was when
they were doing it.

518
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,529
They were talking to
the Board on the phone,

519
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:24,797
and ousting him, and I
tried to call to Elon,

520
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:26,966
and he was on a plane,
and I couldn't get him.

521
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:28,835
I couldn't get him
until the morning,

522
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:31,303
and by then it was too
late, it was already done.

523
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:36,008
I'm sure there was quite a
bit of unhappiness early on,

524
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,477
but he really handled
it marvelously.

525
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,355
Musk left PayPal,

526
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:51,290
but as the largest shareholder,

527
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,160
remained in an advisory role.

528
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:57,396
His next windfall
arrived next 2002,

529
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,799
when eBay bought PayPal,

530
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,602
leaving him wealthy
beyond belief.

531
00:25:03,603 --> 00:25:05,504
That was where Elon

532
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,907
started to make
some serious money.

533
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,844
He cashed in about
$165 million wonderful.

534
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:13,245
What was amazing is he
plowed almost all of it

535
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,648
into these new
business ventures.

536
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:17,149
He didn't put any
aside for himself,

537
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:20,219
didn't think of sort
of personal gain,

538
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,821
in short term at least.

539
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,590
A lot of us would've
just retired.

540
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:26,392
He made the money in PayPal,
he could've just stopped,

541
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:28,695
and you know, bought a place
in the south of France,

542
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:31,764
and said I'm retiring,
I'm 28, and be done,

543
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:32,999
but he ended up starting

544
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,902
three other billion
dollar companies.

545
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,341
- He took $100 million
and put it into SpaceX,

546
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,543
$70 million ended
up going to Tesla,

547
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:47,046
and about $10 million
going to SolarCity.

548
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:49,081
Most people would
say $165 million,

549
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:50,349
I'm set for life.

550
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,884
That's it, where's the beach?

551
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:53,219
Let's go.

552
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:55,722
Not Elon, and I have a
lot of respect for that.

553
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,224
Ladies and gentleman,

554
00:25:58,257 --> 00:25:59,892
please welcome Elon Musk.

555
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:01,393
In 2001,

556
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,963
Elon established
the Musk Foundation,

557
00:26:03,996 --> 00:26:06,966
delivering solar energy
systems to areas of the world

558
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:09,602
struck by natural disasters.

559
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:11,237
He also pledged to give away

560
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:14,807
at least half of his
wealth to philanthropy.

561
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:16,542
A lot of people think

562
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,811
that entrepreneurs
are driven by money,

563
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:20,613
and that's why they're
serial entrepreneurs.

564
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:22,314
They wanna make more and more.

565
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:24,150
Really after you
make $50 million,

566
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:25,551
you need to make more money?

567
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,220
Not really, that's
not a good driver.

568
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,422
They are not driven
by money at all.

569
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,125
He's aware of it no doubt.

570
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,994
If you've got $20
billion floating around,

571
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:36,328
I'm sure you would've noticed,

572
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:38,564
but I don't think that's
the main driver for him.

573
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:39,598
I really don't.

574
00:26:39,632 --> 00:26:41,400
I think he's got
a bigger vision,

575
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,570
beyond this little
thing called money,

576
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,140
but money helps him
execute the dream,

577
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:50,276
so it is a necessary thing.

578
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:54,413
It's certainly not the pursuit
of money at this point.

579
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,415
I think he realized we're here,

580
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,484
and it's more
interesting to spend time

581
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:02,121
doing something that you find
meaningful in your heart,

582
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:03,489
and that's what he's doing.

583
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:04,991
It's almost like a drug.

584
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:06,659
When you've done one
successful thing,

585
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:08,160
you wanna the other one,

586
00:27:08,194 --> 00:27:10,096
you wanna come up with a new
vision and keep learning.

587
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,198
It's just a way of being.

588
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:13,800
He would be bored on the beach.

589
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:18,104
It has to be a very
big world changing goal

590
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,371
for him to get up
in the morning.

591
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:21,373
That's just the way he's wired.

592
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,943
So, I don't expect that to stop.

593
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,344
I think it actually
is gonna make

594
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:26,612
a difference to the world

595
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,681
if we transition to
sustainable transport

596
00:27:28,715 --> 00:27:29,982
sooner rather than later.

597
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,220
We're not doing this because
we thought it was like

598
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:36,488
a way to get rich or anything.

599
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:37,957
Like I said, I thought maybe

600
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,659
a 10 percent chance of
success at the beginning.

601
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:43,529
I thought I would just lose
all my money, and I almost did.

602
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:44,831
So, it's not like it was,

603
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,967
I came very close to
losing everything.

604
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:53,472
Falcon 9
has cleared the tower.

605
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,641
Having
conquered cyber space,

606
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:59,979
Musk's next mission would
focus on outer space.

607
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:03,716
In 2002, he launched one
of the most revolutionary

608
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,317
businesses of our time,

609
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:08,254
focused on shaking up
the space industry.

610
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:13,192
The pivotal breakthrough
that's necessary

611
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,994
to make life multi-planetary is

612
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:18,330
a fully and rapidly
reusable orbit-class rocket.

613
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:19,999
This is a very
difficult thing to do,

614
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,367
because we live in a planet,

615
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,403
where that is just
barely possible.

616
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,838
In the last 12 months or so,

617
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:28,674
I've come to the conclusion
that it can be solved,

618
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:32,211
and I think SpaceX is
going to try to do it.

619
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:33,445
We could fail.

620
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:36,115
I'm not saying we are
certain of success here,

621
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,850
but we are going
to try to do it.

622
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:39,852
He had already been
talking about energy

623
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:41,854
and transportation and space.

624
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:43,422
I was like why space?

625
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,291
He's like space is cool.

626
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,126
Alright.

627
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,028
No one thought he
could do what he's done

628
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,963
when he first set out
to achieve his goals.

629
00:28:50,997 --> 00:28:53,565
I mean this random South African

630
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:54,801
coming along in the 2000s

631
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,068
and saying he wants
to build a rocket

632
00:28:56,102 --> 00:28:58,637
that can land itself
back on the ground,

633
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,139
can take things to orbit

634
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:02,241
for 10 times cheaper
than anyone else.

635
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,210
He was laughed out the
room in most places.

636
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,711
They kind of
ignored him at first

637
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,413
and then he kind
of put his money

638
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,215
where his mouth was literally.

639
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,883
He famously went to Russia once

640
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:12,618
to try and buy some
rocket engines off them,

641
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:14,887
and he got laughed out
of the country basically

642
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:16,388
by their engineers,

643
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:19,391
so he came back to the US
and he built his own rocket.

644
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:22,929
We were still used to
NASA, space equals NASA,

645
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:25,597
but when Elon Musk
started to experiment

646
00:29:25,631 --> 00:29:26,899
with these new rockets,

647
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,835
we realized that
Elon Musk and SpaceX

648
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:31,938
is a serious space player.

649
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:33,339
Everything
looking good

650
00:29:33,372 --> 00:29:36,542
for the beginning of
today's space walking tasks.

651
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:41,147
The first three
SpaceX launches failed,

652
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,917
which sparked skepticism
in many investors.

653
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:47,153
The
vehicle on course on track.

654
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,197
And, we appear to have had
a launch vehicle failure.

655
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,101
Space flight is a
tricky business.

656
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,503
I mean, it is
definitely difficult,

657
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:06,772
and I think we forget
that sometimes.

658
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,442
We see launches and
landings as routine.

659
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:15,147
It's a huge amount of energy
and dangerous substances,

660
00:30:15,181 --> 00:30:17,283
and that work is very hard.

661
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,218
Look where we are today.

662
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:21,320
The critics have been silenced.

663
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:28,627
Just one year
after founding SpaceX,

664
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,330
Musk invested in Tesla Motors,

665
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:33,299
an electric car manufacturer

666
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:37,336
aiming to produce a
power-packed zero polluting car.

667
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:40,639
Over the next several years,

668
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,842
Tesla would take the
lead in a niche market.

669
00:30:44,944 --> 00:30:47,046
Our goal was to really
to try to create

670
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:50,149
the best car in the world
in order to show that

671
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,784
an electric car can be
the best car in the world.

672
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:55,321
Because a lot of people

673
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,690
have this perception that
electric cars are compromised,

674
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,492
that there are issues
with electric cars,

675
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:01,994
and then if you buy electric,

676
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,829
it's because you have some
sort of electric fetish.

677
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,231
What I think is
incredibly important

678
00:31:05,264 --> 00:31:07,366
is to break that perception
and show that indeed

679
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:11,837
the electric car can be
better than any gasoline car.

680
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,439
Cars were always a big deal.

681
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:16,175
He had the F1 McLaren show up

682
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,078
very early on in the X.com days,

683
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:21,613
and there was a Jaguar
very soon after that,

684
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:23,349
and he liked them all very much,

685
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,717
anything that was rare,
expensive, and cool.

686
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,224
If you look at the revolution

687
00:31:32,258 --> 00:31:34,860
that's almost upon
us in electric cars,

688
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,728
Tesla was there first.

689
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:40,432
- There's been
various attempts

690
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:43,102
to bring in electric
cars, which have failed,

691
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:47,406
because big car giants
didn't want them to succeed.

692
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,542
Elon knew nothing
about electric cars

693
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,044
when he started out,

694
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:53,245
but recognized that
there was a problem there

695
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,546
that needed to be solved,

696
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,615
and he just bulldozed
his way through it.

697
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,752
I'm really excited by
the fact that we've got

698
00:32:00,786 --> 00:32:04,323
a zero emission sports car
that can go head-to-head

699
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:06,192
with a Ferrari and
a Porsche and win.

700
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:09,728
This is what's truly disruptive,

701
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,431
a tech guy coming
into the car space.

702
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:14,633
Elon doesn't look
at it as a car.

703
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:15,901
It's a piece of software

704
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,070
with a little bit of
hardware attached to it.

705
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:20,139
The driving
experience in a Tesla,

706
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:22,408
everybody is raving about it.

707
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,510
It was awesome,
it was unbelievable,

708
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:26,345
the acceleration was
out of this world.

709
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:28,247
It was like a roller coaster.

710
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,782
I felt like I was
gonna fly or something.

711
00:32:30,816 --> 00:32:32,951
It's quick, it's silent,

712
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:35,087
but also with Teslas
it's the technology,

713
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:36,855
the fact that they
update themselves.

714
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:39,525
I had a Tesla for a while and
I'll come out in the morning.

715
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:41,360
Software update
as your phone does

716
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:42,961
and you get stuff on your car

717
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:45,097
that you didn't have
the previous night.

718
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:49,335
You can actually move your
Tesla out of a parking spot

719
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:50,936
with your smartphone.

720
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,438
So, it's just incredible.

721
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,174
For somebody who's a
car fan and a tech fan,

722
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:57,309
then Tesla do really
tick a lot of boxes.

723
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,647
The future is electric.

724
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,949
In the future we won't
be filling up for petrol.

725
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,985
Elon has understood
that for a decade.

726
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:08,687
Already you're seeing
countries across Europe,

727
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,856
France, the UK,

728
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,724
who are saying they're gonna
ban the sale of petrol cars

729
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,326
in the next 10, 20 years,

730
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,328
and that's pretty
much thanks to Tesla.

731
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:19,531
In the face of massively
declining oil prices

732
00:33:19,565 --> 00:33:20,999
I think it actually
becomes more urgent

733
00:33:21,033 --> 00:33:23,902
that the auto manufactures
transition to electric

734
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,137
and put a huge amount of effort

735
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:27,306
behind their electric
vehicle programs.

736
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,142
What's amazing is how the
rest of the auto industry

737
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:31,877
is sort of following.

738
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,012
They had this lithium-ion
cell technology

739
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:36,415
that other companies
really couldn't match.

740
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:38,250
- There isn't a car
company in the world

741
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:39,985
who isn't looking at
an electric vehicle.

742
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,653
There's probably not a
car company in the world

743
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:43,355
who hasn't taken a Tesla apart

744
00:33:43,389 --> 00:33:45,657
to see what's going
on underneath.

745
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,593
At Tesla we've open
sourced our patents,

746
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:49,328
so we're trying to be
as helpful as possible

747
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,063
for the advent of
electric vehicles

748
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:53,699
and we've also said that
our super charge network,

749
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:57,236
we're happy to have other
car makers use that network.

750
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,238
We're really doing
doing everything we can

751
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:03,075
to accelerate the advent
of sustainable cars.

752
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,613
I mean, now we know that
GM and Land Rover have said

753
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,715
they're gonna start
doing electric cars

754
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:12,184
in the near future,
just electric cars.

755
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:15,554
There's so many things
that Tesla has done first,

756
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,956
which has got every other
car maker around the planet

757
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,691
looking, thinking yeah,

758
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,627
we've got to do like
that haven't we?

759
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,763
The fundamental problem
is the rules today

760
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,233
incent people to create carbon,

761
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:30,736
and this is madness, and
whatever you incent will happen.

762
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:34,573
We need to send a clear message
to the negotiating teams

763
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:37,143
and to the politicians
that this time

764
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:39,010
there needs to be
significant change.

765
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,480
An essential part

766
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:43,949
of Elon Musk's tale of triumph

767
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:47,719
is how close he came
to complete disaster.

768
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:52,758
By his own admission, 2008 was
the worst year of his life.

769
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,562
His companies were battered
by the economic meltdown.

770
00:34:56,595 --> 00:35:00,566
Three failed launches left
SpaceX hanging in the balance,

771
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,302
and Tesla was on the
verge of bankruptcy.

772
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:07,139
Elon was widely
assumed to be finished.

773
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:11,443
He certainly has
his ups and downs,

774
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:15,647
and believe me it has been
lots and lots of ups and downs.

775
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:18,083
He seems to have the
media on his back

776
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,285
almost permanently,

777
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:21,520
but that seems to be the
price of his success.

778
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:24,089
In the early years, it really
came down to a knife edge,

779
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,092
as to whether or not
SpaceX was going to make it

780
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,028
whether or not it was
going to go bankrupt.

781
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:32,431
He was having to allocate
resources and money

782
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:35,934
between Tesla and SpaceX in
order to keep them going,

783
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,036
and it came down to
having to borrow money

784
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,305
from friends and family,

785
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:41,006
and bear in mind this is
a man who made millions

786
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:43,442
off a software sale earlier.

787
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,477
Elon Musk he has had
plenty of failures,

788
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:47,179
failed rocket launches,

789
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:49,781
and you have to go through
this learning curve.

790
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,383
With the early
rockets and all of that

791
00:35:51,417 --> 00:35:52,718
he didn't seem to
understand that

792
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:54,786
the chances were they
were going to blow up,

793
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,955
but sometimes through
your greatest failure,

794
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,824
you make your greatest
steps forward.

795
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,892
He just keeps going,

796
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:02,628
he keeps pushing the boat out.

797
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,163
It is just an
insatiable appetite

798
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:07,065
to just keep going
whatever happens.

799
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,834
Yes is yes,

800
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:11,169
maybe is yes,

801
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:13,905
and a no is just a delayed yes.

802
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,674
There were a million
places along the way

803
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,709
where he could have
stopped or been derailed

804
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:20,246
or decided to go buy that
island and just sit on it,

805
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:21,213
but he didn't.

806
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:24,816
They're risk takers,
they love it.

807
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,985
They live to be
on the knife edge.

808
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,154
Failure is expected.

809
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,390
Entrepreneurs don't
expect necessarily

810
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:32,891
to succeed all the time,

811
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,594
which is a characteristic
that makes them successful,

812
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:37,229
because when they do fail,

813
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:41,032
and all entrepreneurs do
because they take risks,

814
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:42,501
they just brush it off.

815
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:45,837
They have this phenomenal
bounce back factor.

816
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:50,175
Unlike other people who get
absorbed by the failure,

817
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,577
and get stymied,

818
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,012
and they can't do
anything else for a while,

819
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,047
he can cope with failure.

820
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:58,016
And to be able to bounce back,

821
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,353
and then go into another
venture without blinking an eye

822
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:03,188
is what it's all about.

823
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,227
With his companies
on the brink of collapse,

824
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:12,398
doom was averted
at the last minute.

825
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:15,401
Tesla was saved by investors

826
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:20,439
and SpaceX was awarded a
$1.6 billion NASA contract.

827
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,944
The SpaceX team is incredible.

828
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:27,779
They are really
pushing the boundaries

829
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:31,383
in terms of where we're going
forward with exploration.

830
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:35,153
I think humans are
naturally driven to do this,

831
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:38,156
and this is really
the beginning I think

832
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,225
of human beings leaving
low Earth orbit.

833
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,794
I certainly plan on
being around to see that.

834
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:46,565
In 2010, Elon launched
his Dragon spacecraft

835
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,266
to the International
Space Station.

836
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,735
SpaceX became the first company

837
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,237
to dock a private
spacecraft with the ISS,

838
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,306
which was at the time amazing.

839
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:57,909
This is Mission
Control, Houston,

840
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,445
official hatch opening time

841
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:01,747
for the SpaceX
Dragon Spacecraft.

842
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,484
Every bit of adrenaline in my
body released at that point.

843
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:07,319
It's such an extremely
intense moment.

844
00:38:07,353 --> 00:38:08,587
Anything could have gone wrong,

845
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,922
and everything went
right fortunately,

846
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:14,760
so I felt, I feel very lucky.

847
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,795
Don Pettit giving
the thumbs up there,

848
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,964
as well as the rest of the crew.

849
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:21,333
Elon Musk is developing
a track record

850
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:25,671
of delivering on
what he says he will.

851
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:29,140
So, he already has
developed reusable rockets.

852
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:31,309
He is supplying
the space station.

853
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:33,879
The next stage will
be to have versions

854
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:36,715
of his Dragon Spacecraft
that are human rated.

855
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,150
So, he's actually
delivering on his promise.

856
00:38:45,591 --> 00:38:47,626
After his
marriage to Justine

857
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,828
had unraveled into divorce,

858
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:52,998
Musk began dating British
actress Talulah Riley.

859
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,037
According to Justine,
her divorce was finalized

860
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,373
and six weeks
later she found out

861
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:03,375
Elon was married
to someone else.

862
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:05,677
It was an extremely
quick courting.

863
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:09,047
He met her, courted her,
and then asked her to marry.

864
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,517
They went on to have
a very wonderful,

865
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,985
but also very
tempestuous relationship.

866
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:17,322
They married, they
divorced, they remarried,

867
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,658
they announced a divorce and
they called off their divorce,

868
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,192
and then put the
divorce back on.

869
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:23,328
It's very difficult
to keep track

870
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,665
of Elon and Talulah's
ups and downs.

871
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:29,167
They ended in a very
amicable fashion

872
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,538
and even now Talulah says
never, never say never.

873
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:34,773
They could still end
up back together again.

874
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,915
Over the
next several years,

875
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:47,919
Tesla would take the lead
in the electric car market.

876
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:51,389
Under Elon's leadership,
the company is heralded

877
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:53,792
as the great American
auto industry

878
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:56,327
success story of the century.

879
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,131
This is kind of crazy
but I just learned,

880
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:02,200
I was just told that,

881
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,036
the total number of
orders for the Model 3

882
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,540
in the past 24 hours
has now passed 150,000.

883
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:12,711
His concerns about climate
change and sustainability

884
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:16,381
is what's behind all of this
push towards an electric car,

885
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,283
not just a fancy Tesla,

886
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:22,320
but also a mid-range car
that for $35,000 or less

887
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,089
that everybody can drive.

888
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:26,057
When the Model 3 was launched,

889
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,292
there were something like

890
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:29,294
400,000 people who
put money down.

891
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:31,096
That's unheard of
in the car industry.

892
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,598
You might have
some waiting list,

893
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:36,768
but to wait that long for
a relatively affordable car

894
00:40:36,802 --> 00:40:38,169
is something we
haven't seen before.

895
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:40,005
You can see the line
has been building up

896
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:41,473
ever since we got here,

897
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:44,242
so, it's like a never ending
line and some tourists

898
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,978
actually came up to me
and asked what this was.

899
00:40:47,012 --> 00:40:49,615
And then I said it was Tesla
and they knew about it.

900
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,318
Tesla famously
doesn't advertise.

901
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:54,586
I don't think it needs to.

902
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,522
There's such a buzz
about the brand.

903
00:40:57,823 --> 00:40:59,625
Things were on
track to be able to

904
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,928
meet the Model 3
production timing

905
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,763
in the middle of next year,

906
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:08,466
and really excited
about what's happening.

907
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:12,103
Tesla's value is something

908
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:14,606
that has a lot of people
scratching their heads,

909
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,608
the fact that it's a company
that's not making money,

910
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:19,177
but yet it has a, a huge value.

911
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:23,782
If you look at the
revenues to market cap

912
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:27,953
of the car maker Honda and
the value to revenue on Tesla,

913
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,556
Honda would be trading
at about 0.5 times.

914
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:33,959
Tesla would be trading
about 7.4 times today.

915
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,995
So, Tesla is obviously
valued a lot more

916
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:40,666
given the little revenue
that it produces.

917
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:41,900
Why?

918
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:44,235
Because there's a lot of
goodwill in the stock,

919
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:46,371
and that's because
Elon has a fan club

920
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:48,239
in the investment community.

921
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:51,042
And that access to
capital, that good will,

922
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:54,312
that brand if you like
is wonderful for Elon,

923
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,482
because that does allow him
to get on with other things,

924
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,552
such as The Boring Company
or his AI ambitions

925
00:42:00,586 --> 00:42:04,590
or whatever else crazy
frontier driven ideas

926
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:06,592
he comes up with next.

927
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:09,995
The reputation Tesla has as
much to do with the product

928
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,830
as the guy that's
running the company.

929
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,331
Frankly, if the cars
weren't any good

930
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,600
people wouldn't buy them,

931
00:42:14,633 --> 00:42:17,268
but they are good, they
are technology leaders,

932
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:19,070
and that's what really
gets the following.

933
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:20,572
The fact that there's
a guy like Elon

934
00:42:20,606 --> 00:42:23,842
running the company as well
is the icing on the cake.

935
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,376
The general public
really appreciate

936
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,945
that sort of candid approach

937
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:28,880
to how he's running
his companies.

938
00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:31,049
What keeps me
intrigued about Musk

939
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:32,784
is that if you look closely,

940
00:42:32,818 --> 00:42:36,221
you can see his signature in
the products that he makes.

941
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:39,891
So, for example, the Tesla
sound system goes up to 11.

942
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:41,492
It's a reference to Spinal Tap.

943
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:43,895
The Ludicrous Mode,

944
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:45,897
the warp speed that
you get on the screen

945
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:48,366
when you unlock an Easter
egg for extra performance.

946
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,701
It's those little details

947
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:52,537
that car companies
don't normally do

948
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,906
but Tesla just has a
bit of fun with them.

949
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,207
It's not yet like Knight Rider,

950
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,710
because the car doesn't
talk back at you.

951
00:42:58,744 --> 00:43:00,712
You can't have a
conversation with it,

952
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:02,748
but when it comes to
autonomous technology,

953
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:05,917
Tesla is certainly one
of the leaders out there.

954
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:08,620
If people want
electric cars, fine,

955
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:12,824
but you see through
electric cars comes what?

956
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:15,460
Driverless cars.

957
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:17,595
Now, when you see
some of the things

958
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:19,097
that have happened
with driverless cars

959
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,067
and you see how computers
can go wrong, well you know,

960
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,136
I'm not sure I would want
to be in driverless car.

961
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,471
People are quite keyed off

962
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:28,640
over the whole
autonomous vehicle thing.

963
00:43:28,674 --> 00:43:30,742
I think maybe people have
this like image of like,

964
00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:32,310
robot cars run amok.

965
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:35,146
It's really not
anything like that.

966
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,915
All of that would apply to,

967
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,950
the software goes through
extreme levels of validation

968
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:40,418
before a customer ever sees it.

969
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,653
So, there's all
sorts of nonsense

970
00:43:41,687 --> 00:43:42,921
about people being used
as human guinea pigs.

971
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,522
You know, it's basically

972
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:46,992
advanced driver's
assistance at this point,

973
00:43:47,025 --> 00:43:49,494
and in fact we use
the name Autopilot,

974
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:52,130
because that's what that's
what's used in an aircraft,

975
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:55,466
but the presumption in aircraft
is that the pilot must,

976
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,935
you know, pay
attention and be alert

977
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:58,804
and be ready to take
over at any time,

978
00:43:58,837 --> 00:44:01,272
not that the pilot can
then go, go to sleep,

979
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:04,275
or you know walk away
from the cockpit.

980
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,318
Musk is confronting

981
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:16,521
some of the world's
biggest challenges head on.

982
00:44:16,554 --> 00:44:20,826
Through Tesla, he intends to
reduce our use of fossil fuels,

983
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:23,862
while simultaneously
attempting to revolutionize

984
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:24,896
the energy industry.

985
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:27,833
A key part of his aim

986
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:30,736
is to change not just
energy consumption,

987
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:32,370
but energy production.

988
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,807
Elon is the Chairman
of SolarCity,

989
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:38,810
one of the largest producers
of solar power systems

990
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:40,278
in the United States.

991
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,414
People in a remote village
or an island somewhere

992
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:47,085
can take solar panels, combine
it with the Tesla Powerwall

993
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:50,355
and never have to worry about
having electricity lines.

994
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:51,556
Electricity lines are not

995
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:52,824
the most pretty
thing in the world.

996
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:54,359
So, being able to
have this solution

997
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:56,327
just works wherever you are.

998
00:44:56,361 --> 00:44:59,397
The fact that it's
wall mounted is vital,

999
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:02,067
because it means you don't
need to have a battery room.

1000
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,670
It means that a normal
household can mount this

1001
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:09,340
on their garage or on the
outside wall of their house

1002
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:11,342
and it doesn't take up any room.

1003
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:14,112
You could actually go if you
want completely off grid.

1004
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:17,282
You can take your solar panels,
charge the battery packs,

1005
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:21,753
and that's all you use and
the cost of this is $3500.

1006
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,892
Oh wow, the grid,
it's actually zero.

1007
00:45:28,493 --> 00:45:31,396
This entire night has
been powered by batteries.

1008
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,536
With The SolarCity Company
as now part of Tesla.

1009
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,038
Elon is trying to
make solar panels

1010
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,040
more attractive to
the mass market.

1011
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:44,042
They launched their new
solar roof technology,

1012
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,710
whereas in the old days
solar panels would be

1013
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,713
big, black, bulky squares

1014
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,581
that you'd put out on
your roof or your garden.

1015
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:52,250
Now people going to
have solar panels

1016
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:53,584
embedded into their roof.

1017
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,255
Tesla's
lithium-ion battery

1018
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:59,224
installed in South Australia,

1019
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:01,726
led to a massive
drop in the cost

1020
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:04,896
of backing up the
region's power supply.

1021
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,132
The system powered
by wind turbines

1022
00:46:07,165 --> 00:46:11,136
reduced the price of power
outages by 90 percent.

1023
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:13,771
They are taking the
surplus electricity

1024
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:15,406
that's being produced
in Australia,

1025
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,108
and storing it and putting
it back to the grid.

1026
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:18,509
I think their latest
estimate suggests

1027
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:20,111
they're making up to a
million dollars a day

1028
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:21,412
in the electricity
they're storing,

1029
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:22,914
which is pretty impressive.

1030
00:46:22,948 --> 00:46:25,917
That came from a bet that
he made over Twitter.

1031
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:28,586
So, it was an
Australian businessman,

1032
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,521
and they were discussing
about the feasibility

1033
00:46:30,555 --> 00:46:32,590
of making a city
run on solar power.

1034
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,160
And a bet was
issued to Musk about

1035
00:46:35,193 --> 00:46:36,928
can you do that
in this much time,

1036
00:46:36,962 --> 00:46:38,563
and he went, I'll take that bet.

1037
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:42,968
He put the batteries in place,

1038
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:44,635
had it up and running
within the time scale,

1039
00:46:44,669 --> 00:46:47,572
all for a billionaire's bet
and that's what came of it.

1040
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:51,376
We have reached an agreement

1041
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,544
with Tesla Motor Company

1042
00:46:53,578 --> 00:46:57,849
subject to legislative
review and approval,

1043
00:46:57,883 --> 00:47:02,620
that will enable Tesla to
build the world's largest

1044
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,023
and most advanced
battery factory,

1045
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:07,692
right here in the Silver State.

1046
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,362
Why do we even call
it the Gigafactory?

1047
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:13,664
It's because, it's
actually gonna be,

1048
00:47:13,698 --> 00:47:15,133
it's not just gonna be

1049
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,002
the biggest lithium-ion
battery factory in the world,

1050
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:18,669
but it will actually
be bigger than the sum

1051
00:47:18,703 --> 00:47:21,406
of all lithium-ion
factories in the world.

1052
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:23,574
So, it's difficult to
quite describe in words,

1053
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:25,476
but it's a heck
of a big factory.

1054
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,386
Since
the Dragon launch,

1055
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:39,657
Elon Musk has continued to
make history with SpaceX.

1056
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,526
When the Falcon Heavy rocket

1057
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,828
launched in February 2018,

1058
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,998
it heralded the start
of a new space race.

1059
00:47:48,733 --> 00:47:50,201
This is a big deal.

1060
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:52,870
This is kind of the Super
Bowl of rocket launches.

1061
00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:56,607
Elon Musk and his
team just proved

1062
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:58,043
that the Falcon Heavy works,

1063
00:47:58,076 --> 00:48:00,845
which puts us now in a
completely different realm,

1064
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,413
what we can put into deep space,

1065
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:03,748
what we can send to Mars.

1066
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:06,884
Lifting off
from the same launch pad

1067
00:48:06,918 --> 00:48:10,121
that sent the crew of
Apollo 11 to the moon,

1068
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:12,523
the mission
represented a new era

1069
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:15,193
in the progress of space flight.

1070
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:23,068
The launch of the
SpaceX Falcon Heavy,

1071
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:26,404
it was significant for so
many reasons scientifically.

1072
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:28,706
I mean it's the most powerful
rocket we've seen launched

1073
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,242
since the Saturn V, which
took humans to the moon.

1074
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:36,047
It's one
small step for man,

1075
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:40,251
one giant leap for mankind.

1076
00:48:40,285 --> 00:48:44,422
We are entering a new
era of space exploration,

1077
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,124
which is extremely exciting.

1078
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:48,526
Sort of the continuance
of the dream of Apollo.

1079
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,729
I was on the Space
Coast for the launch.

1080
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,898
I haven't seen it that
busy there since 2011

1081
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,066
when the space shuttle launched

1082
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,235
and landed for the final time.

1083
00:48:57,268 --> 00:49:00,105
It really has started to
capture people's imaginations

1084
00:49:00,138 --> 00:49:02,407
about space exploration.

1085
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,810
It was a great achievement
by a private company

1086
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:08,779
to create and
successfully launch

1087
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:13,818
one of the biggest lifting
rockets ever in history.

1088
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:16,921
It's the third largest
rocket ever to be launched.

1089
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,257
We had the Apollo Saturn V,

1090
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,758
and of course we
had the shuttle.

1091
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,928
The Falcon Heavy is
that order of magnitude.

1092
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:27,532
It is a seriously big rocket.

1093
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:30,435
The Falcon Heavy
can carry 64 tons.

1094
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:32,937
That's a lot, I
mean it's a truck.

1095
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,641
It's the equivalent
of a 737 jetliner,

1096
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:38,009
filled with passengers,

1097
00:49:38,043 --> 00:49:39,777
filled with baggage,
filled with fuel,

1098
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,113
lifting that up and
sending it into space,

1099
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:43,714
and not just sending
it into space,

1100
00:49:43,748 --> 00:49:45,383
sending it beyond
low Earth orbit,

1101
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:48,219
sending it beyond the moon,
sending it beyond Mars.

1102
00:49:48,253 --> 00:49:51,989
This launch will also have
political implications

1103
00:49:52,023 --> 00:49:53,191
in my view,

1104
00:49:53,224 --> 00:49:56,627
because the American
government is preparing

1105
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:58,796
and budgeting for
NASA's rockets,

1106
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:02,300
but the fact that Elon
and SpaceX have now proven

1107
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,470
they can successfully
launch the Falcon Heavy,

1108
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:08,673
which will probably have a
cost at about a $100 million,

1109
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:11,576
that's about 10 % of
the NASA rockets,

1110
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:14,412
so they are budgeting about
a billion dollars per launch.

1111
00:50:14,445 --> 00:50:16,314
That's a significant
cost saving,

1112
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,983
and that is what a
private enterprise can do

1113
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,186
when you put the right
person at the helm

1114
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:23,854
and you give him a chance
to execute his vision.

1115
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:26,624
In order for us to

1116
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,328
really open up access to space

1117
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:34,499
we've got to achieve full
and rapid reusability,

1118
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:37,668
and being able to do that for
the primary rocket booster

1119
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:40,838
is gonna be a huge
impact on the cost.

1120
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,908
Now this will still take us a
few years to make that smooth,

1121
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:46,611
and make it efficient,

1122
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:50,014
but it's, I think it's
proven that it can work.

1123
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,922
Of all
Musk's innovations

1124
00:50:57,955 --> 00:51:01,926
developing reusable rockets
could be the most radical.

1125
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:04,762
We thought it was
more likely than not

1126
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,431
that this mission would work,

1127
00:51:06,464 --> 00:51:10,268
but still probably, you know
one third chance of failure.

1128
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:11,736
The Holy Grail for space

1129
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:15,206
is to have a totally
reusable launch system.

1130
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:18,609
So, to actually see the
SpaceX Falcon rockets

1131
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:20,545
launching its
spacecraft into orbit

1132
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:22,213
and then coming back down

1133
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:25,250
and performing a
pinpoint accurate landing

1134
00:51:25,283 --> 00:51:29,554
on a floating platform at sea,
that is pretty astonishing.

1135
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,055
It's quite a tiny target.

1136
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,158
It's really trying to land
on a postage stamp there.

1137
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:34,792
Just to put it this way,

1138
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:37,395
you get on an airplane
and you fly somewhere,

1139
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,730
you wouldn't dream of
throwing that airplane away,

1140
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:42,167
so why do we do the
same with space rockets?

1141
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,303
That's what SpaceX is trying
to do and they're succeeding.

1142
00:51:45,336 --> 00:51:47,272
They're leading the
way at the moment.

1143
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:48,739
Elon is getting
people to question

1144
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:50,908
why NASA is still building
any rockets at all.

1145
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,110
They think if SpaceX can do it,

1146
00:51:53,144 --> 00:51:55,246
why do we need to buy
a comparable rocket?

1147
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,947
We can just buy
that one off them.

1148
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,418
Inside the Falcon Heavy
rocket was a plaque

1149
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:03,454
with 6,000 names of all
the SpaceX employees

1150
00:52:03,488 --> 00:52:05,290
that worked on the project,

1151
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:08,859
and that just shows
that he's willing to

1152
00:52:08,893 --> 00:52:11,462
really value the people
that work for him.

1153
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,633
Elon Musk's aspiration
is to eventually

1154
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:17,134
put all of his efforts

1155
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:20,338
into developing
far larger rockets,

1156
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:23,441
which can still launch
payloads into Earth orbit,

1157
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:27,312
but also be capable of
taking human rated spacecraft

1158
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:29,980
into deep space, i.e. Mars.

1159
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:38,055
You have like a 10 to
20 year horizon here

1160
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:39,490
when you want to go to Mars.

1161
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,193
- I wanna enable--
- SpaceX.

1162
00:52:42,227 --> 00:52:44,529
I wanna enable large
numbers of people

1163
00:52:44,562 --> 00:52:46,731
and cargo to go to Mars.

1164
00:52:46,764 --> 00:52:48,633
So, it's not sort of
about me personally

1165
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,301
want to make a
journey back to Mars,

1166
00:52:50,335 --> 00:52:51,802
I mean that would be
nice on a personal level,

1167
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:54,004
but I do think it is important

1168
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:58,643
that we as a species
of this civilization

1169
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:02,780
are on a path to become a
true space ranked civilization

1170
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,182
and a multi planet species.

1171
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:09,487
Musk aims to launch

1172
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,523
a mission to Mars by 2022.

1173
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:16,327
Elon Musk's ultimate
goal is to have humans

1174
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:18,596
permanently living
and working on Mars,

1175
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:21,566
a Martian colony you could say.

1176
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,834
Mars is very special.

1177
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:27,672
It has a sky and
it has landscape

1178
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:32,710
and large amounts of frozen
water and it has seasons,

1179
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:36,046
so there are a lot of
similarities to Earth.

1180
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:38,683
The atmosphere is much thinner

1181
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,184
than the Earth's atmosphere,

1182
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,254
but you've got carbon and
then you've got oxygen,

1183
00:53:43,288 --> 00:53:44,455
so you could potentially use

1184
00:53:44,489 --> 00:53:47,858
what's on Mars's
atmosphere as resources.

1185
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:50,561
It's a very terrestrial
environment.

1186
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:53,230
It appears to be a home
from home but is it?

1187
00:53:56,601 --> 00:53:58,369
It is possible in our lifetime

1188
00:53:58,403 --> 00:54:01,539
to send a rocket
to Mars, manned,

1189
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,240
I do think that's possible.

1190
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:05,810
Do we wanna do it?

1191
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:07,111
Do we wanna pay for it?

1192
00:54:07,144 --> 00:54:08,613
That's a different question.

1193
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:10,781
There's a lot of questions,
there's a lot of hurdles,

1194
00:54:10,815 --> 00:54:12,817
but as long as
Elon doesn't break

1195
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:15,152
the fundamental laws of
physics we can do it.

1196
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:20,725
Mars is reachable and I'm
sure we will devise the means

1197
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:22,727
by which we can live there,

1198
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,830
but there are many
questions and challenges

1199
00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:27,498
before that can be achieved.

1200
00:54:27,532 --> 00:54:30,067
So, let Musk say
he's gonna do it,

1201
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,936
because he probably will.

1202
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:36,907
If he maintains this
momentum, I see no reason

1203
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:40,478
why he shouldn't be landing
spacecrafts on Mars.

1204
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,285
Elon Musk's
evolvement with design,

1205
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,489
engineering and critical
technical decisions

1206
00:54:51,522 --> 00:54:53,891
is unique amongst his peers.

1207
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,862
Believe me, Elon is just
as smart on engineering

1208
00:54:57,895 --> 00:54:59,797
as he is on the money side.

1209
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:02,867
Even in the earlier
days of Tesla and SpaceX

1210
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,769
he could easily have said,

1211
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,937
let me put in some
of my cash in there,

1212
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:09,106
and we'll put some
clever technical people,

1213
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,376
and I'll just run it,
I'll be the manager,

1214
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,844
I'll be the CEO or
whatever, uhn-uhn.

1215
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:15,480
To actually be able
to get so involved

1216
00:55:15,513 --> 00:55:17,815
in the engineering
side, that's amazing,

1217
00:55:17,848 --> 00:55:19,116
but that's what he did,

1218
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,552
because deep down
he is an engineer.

1219
00:55:21,586 --> 00:55:24,722
I would say he approaches
engineering and business

1220
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:28,793
in much the same fashion,
it's a puzzle to be dissected,

1221
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:32,296
and then the pieces put
back together in some way.

1222
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,732
At his heart, the
man is an engineer.

1223
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:37,167
I think that's where
his first love is.

1224
00:55:37,201 --> 00:55:38,135
He'll be walking around SpaceX,

1225
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,337
and will talk to the employees,

1226
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:43,374
and then will quiz them on
things like thrust vectors

1227
00:55:43,408 --> 00:55:45,643
or aero dynamical design,

1228
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:48,813
not typical of CEO behavior.

1229
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:51,015
I think the engineering
came more naturally

1230
00:55:51,048 --> 00:55:52,483
because the engineering part

1231
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:54,685
is a more rational approach.

1232
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:58,589
He sort of struggled early on

1233
00:55:58,623 --> 00:56:02,226
in the CEO role of his
two early companies,

1234
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:05,095
but certainly we've seen
that he just learned

1235
00:56:05,129 --> 00:56:08,533
and grew from that, and
so I think you know,

1236
00:56:08,566 --> 00:56:12,002
he's sort of the whole
package at this point.

1237
00:56:12,036 --> 00:56:14,605
I don't think too many
people would argue with that.

1238
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:19,744
Some entrepreneurs are more
socially skilled than others,

1239
00:56:19,777 --> 00:56:22,179
but they're not necessarily
socially skilled,

1240
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,514
because they're too focused.

1241
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:26,417
You see, if you're a
socially skilled human being,

1242
00:56:26,451 --> 00:56:28,853
then you're sensitive
to everybody around you,

1243
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:30,955
but that may prevent you
from actually getting on

1244
00:56:30,988 --> 00:56:33,424
to achieve your objective,

1245
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:35,359
and they have
objectives in mind,

1246
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,462
and they are
ruthless in the sense

1247
00:56:37,495 --> 00:56:39,964
of trying to achieve
that objective.

1248
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:43,468
Not ruthless in the way they
treat other people necessarily,

1249
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:47,204
just in making sure that
they're on their own timeline

1250
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,306
to achieve that objective.

1251
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:57,448
I had made an
enormous PR mistake,

1252
00:56:57,482 --> 00:57:00,417
and it had landed on the front
page of the New York post,

1253
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:04,489
and it was bad, like it
was mortifyingly bad,

1254
00:57:04,522 --> 00:57:06,390
and when I went into
tell Elon about it,

1255
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:08,593
you know, he was very,
very angry with me,

1256
00:57:08,626 --> 00:57:09,960
and the things that he said,

1257
00:57:09,994 --> 00:57:12,497
the thing that he said
that stuck with me was,

1258
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:15,265
Julie, perception
becomes reality.

1259
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:17,301
It was the only time
that he was really,

1260
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:19,236
really angry with me
that I can remember.

1261
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,238
And the fact that
he didn't fire me,

1262
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,774
I think just points to
him being a nice guy.

1263
00:57:26,611 --> 00:57:29,279
One of the things I find
so fascinating about Elon

1264
00:57:29,313 --> 00:57:33,784
is that in the midst of all
his acumen and business sense

1265
00:57:33,818 --> 00:57:37,588
he does interviews where
he tears up and even cries

1266
00:57:37,622 --> 00:57:41,191
talking about how he
wants to find the one.

1267
00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:43,694
It's not easy being Elon.

1268
00:57:43,728 --> 00:57:45,830
It sounds amazing,
it sounds glamorous,

1269
00:57:45,863 --> 00:57:48,766
and it no doubt is
also a lot of fun.

1270
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,202
He's having a ball executing
his engineering dreams.

1271
00:57:52,236 --> 00:57:54,705
The flip side of that comes
with the personal side,

1272
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:55,906
it ain't easy.

1273
00:57:57,842 --> 00:57:59,309
Elon started dating

1274
00:57:59,343 --> 00:58:02,613
a very famous celebrity
actress who was at the time

1275
00:58:02,647 --> 00:58:05,683
at war with her
ex-husband Johnny Depp.

1276
00:58:05,716 --> 00:58:07,785
Like, I don't know
what it is about Amber,

1277
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:10,621
but men who fall
in love with Amber,

1278
00:58:10,655 --> 00:58:13,290
they fall hard for Amber.

1279
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,126
So, everyone was very
curious, in the showbiz world,

1280
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,163
to see who Amber would
end up with next,

1281
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:21,398
and when we saw she
was with a billionaire,

1282
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:23,801
who had this kind of baby face,

1283
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:26,737
there was a lot of interest
in finding out more.

1284
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,140
The breakup between
Elon and Amber

1285
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:31,842
was very painful for Elon,

1286
00:58:31,876 --> 00:58:34,144
and he very
characteristically I suppose

1287
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,413
is very open with
people and journalists

1288
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:37,915
about how much he was hurting.

1289
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:40,751
At one stage, in a very
high profile interview

1290
00:58:40,785 --> 00:58:42,152
he did with Rolling Stone,

1291
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:45,690
he actually asked the journalist
who was doing the story,

1292
00:58:45,723 --> 00:58:47,925
do you know anybody you
could set me up with?

1293
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:50,227
Is there anybody you
know I should date?

1294
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,197
For a billionaire guy, who
is like, let's be honest,

1295
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:57,668
decently good looking,
to be out there talking

1296
00:58:57,702 --> 00:59:00,504
about how he wants to
find a nice girlfriend,

1297
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,774
it's just something you don't
see come along very often.

1298
00:59:03,808 --> 00:59:05,676
He's fairly an open book.

1299
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:08,012
So, if they had been
spending some time together

1300
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:11,849
and the journalist had earned
his trust in some capacity,

1301
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:13,283
it wouldn't surprise me at all.

1302
00:59:13,317 --> 00:59:16,020
I mean, he definitely wears
his heart on his sleeve.

1303
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:18,589
I would say he's a
big softie underneath.

1304
00:59:19,724 --> 00:59:22,026
I mean Elon is so
honest and vulnerable,

1305
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,594
and I think that's
why people find him

1306
00:59:23,628 --> 00:59:25,529
so incredibly endearing.

1307
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,866
There are a lot of
technological dreams

1308
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:31,068
that Elon Musk would
have for himself

1309
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:32,637
over the next two decades,

1310
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:34,805
but I think as much as
he wants all of that,

1311
00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:38,709
I think Elon Musk would
like to be happily in love.

1312
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:47,251
Musk continues
to invest in the future.

1313
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:52,422
In 2013, he outlined a
potential world changing plan

1314
00:59:52,456 --> 00:59:54,224
for a transportation system

1315
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:57,327
that could reshape the
way humanity travels.

1316
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,098
Elon Musk came up with an idea.

1317
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:04,001
He published a white paper
on this vacuum transport,

1318
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:05,169
but let it go.

1319
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:06,671
He said I'm not
gonna do this myself.

1320
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:09,239
What I'm gonna do is open
up to third party companies

1321
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:11,608
that want to develop
it themselves.

1322
01:00:11,642 --> 01:00:14,178
The Hyperloop project
is of huge interest

1323
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:16,013
in terms of the world
of transportation,

1324
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:19,650
the idea of going from San
Francisco to Los Angeles

1325
01:00:19,684 --> 01:00:22,286
in the time it
would take to drive

1326
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,855
from San Francisco to
the edge of San Francisco

1327
01:00:24,889 --> 01:00:26,123
is fantastic.

1328
01:00:26,156 --> 01:00:27,925
It's a vacuum tube,
where all the air

1329
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,794
is sucked out of the
tube, and you send a pod

1330
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:31,696
containing passengers
through the tube.

1331
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:33,597
There's no friction,
there's no air resistance,

1332
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,766
because the pods are
levitating on magnets.

1333
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,301
- The technology is sound.

1334
01:00:37,334 --> 01:00:39,870
We can travel faster in a
vacuum, there's no friction.

1335
01:00:39,904 --> 01:00:40,938
They want to get up to speeds

1336
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:43,607
about 500 to 700 miles an hour.

1337
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,210
Elon's idea is that tubes
could connect major cities,

1338
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:48,145
and you could travel in
one of these passenger pods

1339
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:50,447
and travel from, say,
L.A. to New York

1340
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,116
in a matter of half an hour.

1341
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:53,483
When he was talking
about it the first time,

1342
01:00:53,517 --> 01:00:56,053
we all thought oh well
this time he might have,

1343
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:57,788
he might have lost
it a little bit,

1344
01:00:57,822 --> 01:01:01,391
or it's a little bit too
ambitious or too crazy,

1345
01:01:01,425 --> 01:01:05,295
but, as with many other of
Elon's ideas, watch that space,

1346
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:06,797
because before you know it,

1347
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:08,632
and actually ahead of schedule,

1348
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,901
this thing is actually
becoming reality.

1349
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:17,507
The speed we can put these
tunnels out is dramatic,

1350
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:19,143
how fast it can all happen.

1351
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:22,079
So, I think a lot of the
world will be connected.

1352
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:26,483
We'll be moving cargo in 2019.

1353
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,318
We think we can have passengers

1354
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:32,289
safely being transported
in Hyperloop by 2021.

1355
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,494
Elon Musk
is a leading voice

1356
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:40,697
on the potential of
an AI apocalypse.

1357
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:43,934
He has declared that
digital super intelligence

1358
01:01:43,968 --> 01:01:45,702
is the most serious threat

1359
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:47,972
to the survival
of the human race.

1360
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,943
To offset this, he
launched Neuralink,

1361
01:01:52,977 --> 01:01:54,344
aimed to developing safe

1362
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:57,047
and beneficial
artificial intelligence.

1363
01:01:58,883 --> 01:02:01,051
The dangers of AI,

1364
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:04,454
are the end of the human
mind as we know it.

1365
01:02:04,488 --> 01:02:05,923
You're dealing with something

1366
01:02:05,956 --> 01:02:07,691
that is fundamentally going
to be smarter than you.

1367
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,059
It's gonna learn on its own,

1368
01:02:09,093 --> 01:02:10,895
so how do you stay ahead of it?

1369
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:13,463
That's something that Musk
is paying close attention to.

1370
01:02:13,497 --> 01:02:14,698
His main concern is that,

1371
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,967
if AI becomes too smart
and too important,

1372
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:18,803
then why do you need humans?

1373
01:02:18,836 --> 01:02:20,237
We kind of become obsolete.

1374
01:02:21,505 --> 01:02:24,074
The very worst nightmare

1375
01:02:24,108 --> 01:02:27,277
that a Hollywood horror
movie could come up with

1376
01:02:27,311 --> 01:02:30,647
is as nothing compared
to where we're heading

1377
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,449
and heading so fast.

1378
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,657
When AI has the
ability to think,

1379
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:45,295
to come to conclusions, and
to make judgments, et cetera,

1380
01:02:45,329 --> 01:02:47,297
just like the human mind,

1381
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:51,435
does anyone think they might
just be the slightest chance

1382
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:55,772
that through that alone, AI
could take the planet over?

1383
01:02:58,809 --> 01:03:00,845
If they do become self-aware,

1384
01:03:00,878 --> 01:03:02,079
how are we gonna control them?

1385
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,081
Who's gonna control
the controllers?

1386
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:05,449
It's a scary prospect.

1387
01:03:06,851 --> 01:03:10,487
What is its potential
to take over everything?

1388
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,489
You know what its potential
to take over everything is?

1389
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:16,693
100 percent, it's
the end of humanity.

1390
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:19,763
When software rises up
and becomes all powerful,

1391
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:20,998
where are we gonna look to?

1392
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:22,699
We're gonna look to
the titans of industry

1393
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:24,268
to provide a counterweight.

1394
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:28,038
Elon is ideally placed to
be the sort of counterpoint

1395
01:03:28,072 --> 01:03:30,274
to this software early vision.

1396
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:31,441
I mean it's interesting

1397
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:33,844
that he's also looking
into AI himself

1398
01:03:33,878 --> 01:03:35,812
with open AI and Neuralink.

1399
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:41,118
When I hear Elon Musk
talking about the fact

1400
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:45,956
that AI revolution is
humanity summoning the demon,

1401
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:48,292
absolutely it is,

1402
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:51,996
but then founding and opening
company called Neuralink

1403
01:03:52,029 --> 01:03:55,199
to connect AI to
the human brain.

1404
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:58,635
I mean that contradiction
is so extraordinary,

1405
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,837
I don't know the
thought processes

1406
01:04:00,871 --> 01:04:02,272
that must be going on there.

1407
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:05,542
Neuralink is a direct response

1408
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:08,145
of Elon's concerns to
AI in the first place.

1409
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:10,414
The fact that he thinks
AI might surpass humans

1410
01:04:10,447 --> 01:04:12,649
in terms of its
mental capabilities,

1411
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,185
it makes sense that he would
try and develop technology

1412
01:04:15,219 --> 01:04:17,554
using computers in
tandem with our biology.

1413
01:04:18,923 --> 01:04:22,026
I think that Elon
Musk wants to use AI

1414
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:26,730
as a tool for
augmenting our self,

1415
01:04:26,763 --> 01:04:29,699
and not a tool for
replacing our self.

1416
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:32,336
I think he's saying if
you can't beat them,

1417
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:35,705
become superhuman
and then beat them.

1418
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:38,708
Brain computer interfaces
could help people

1419
01:04:38,742 --> 01:04:39,910
in two different ways.

1420
01:04:39,944 --> 01:04:43,213
So, one way would be
to restore capabilities

1421
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:45,349
for people with disabilities,

1422
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,417
and another application would

1423
01:04:47,451 --> 01:04:50,054
be to go beyond our limitation.

1424
01:04:50,087 --> 01:04:52,422
And so, for example
we could think

1425
01:04:52,456 --> 01:04:56,593
about controlling a computer
just with our thoughts

1426
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:58,595
without moving any muscle,

1427
01:04:58,628 --> 01:05:01,531
and that's the core
function of a BCI,

1428
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:03,600
a brain-computer interface.

1429
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:05,469
There are a lot of
different scenarios

1430
01:05:05,502 --> 01:05:07,371
in which you could
apply this technology.

1431
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:09,306
We are talking about critical

1432
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:11,976
decision making in the military,

1433
01:05:12,009 --> 01:05:15,912
in a warfare scenario,
or in the health sector.

1434
01:05:15,946 --> 01:05:19,383
So, whenever we talk
about hybrid humans,

1435
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:22,552
or human and
machine, or cyborgs,

1436
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:25,622
we are all talking about
the same thing I think,

1437
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:30,460
which is using technology
to augment our capabilities

1438
01:05:31,428 --> 01:05:32,262
and that's it.

1439
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:36,233
Musk's skepticism

1440
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:39,269
about the potential
risks of AI technology

1441
01:05:39,303 --> 01:05:42,272
has led to a public clash
with Mark Zuckerberg.

1442
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:46,576
I am optimistic about
the future of AI.

1443
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:49,746
I think that AI
is going to unlock

1444
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,682
a huge amount of
positive things,

1445
01:05:52,716 --> 01:05:56,286
whether that's helping to
identify and cure diseases,

1446
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:59,089
to help cars drive more safely,

1447
01:05:59,123 --> 01:06:01,091
to help keep our
communities safe,

1448
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,127
are there going to be
issues along the way?

1449
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,361
Of course there are.

1450
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:06,663
No technology comes
out fully formed,

1451
01:06:06,696 --> 01:06:09,466
and we need the pioneers to
be able to go work on this

1452
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:11,801
and get to the
state that we want.

1453
01:06:15,139 --> 01:06:16,640
I do think it's very healthy

1454
01:06:16,673 --> 01:06:20,344
that we have such
technology giants

1455
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:22,179
fighting it out publicly,

1456
01:06:22,212 --> 01:06:24,348
so that we can all form
an opinion about it.

1457
01:06:24,381 --> 01:06:27,284
It's a spectator sport
now for the rest of us.

1458
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:29,353
Mark Zuckerberg sees
Elon as a naysayer

1459
01:06:29,386 --> 01:06:32,856
and someone who's trying to
stop the development of AI.

1460
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:34,958
I can see both sides
of the argument.

1461
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,527
I'd probably slide slightly
with Mark Zuckerberg

1462
01:06:37,561 --> 01:06:39,829
in the sense that I think we
will be able to control AI

1463
01:06:39,863 --> 01:06:42,399
enough to keep humanity safe.

1464
01:06:42,432 --> 01:06:44,401
I wouldn't bet against Elon.

1465
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:47,003
You know if Elon thinks
that AI is gonna take over

1466
01:06:47,037 --> 01:06:48,172
and eventually decide

1467
01:06:48,205 --> 01:06:51,075
that us irrational
humans are unnecessary,

1468
01:06:51,108 --> 01:06:52,309
I would trust him.

1469
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,511
You know, he hasn't
been wrong about a lot.

1470
01:06:54,544 --> 01:06:57,481
The debate is either it's a
good thing, we must do it.

1471
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:01,385
It's a bad thing, but we still
must do it in another way.

1472
01:07:01,418 --> 01:07:04,188
We should stop
doing it immediately

1473
01:07:04,221 --> 01:07:07,991
before the line is crossed
where humanity is no more.

1474
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,025
We need policies.

1475
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:10,760
We need to start thinking,

1476
01:07:10,794 --> 01:07:14,631
what is a good application
of BCI and what is not.

1477
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:18,335
We need to be the
one with the control,

1478
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:19,903
being able to push a button,

1479
01:07:19,936 --> 01:07:21,905
and disable the
AI at any moment.

1480
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,509
Artificial intelligence
can generate

1481
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,511
quite successful content,

1482
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:30,180
however, rather than
replacing humans,

1483
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:32,549
I'd prefer to see
us working together.

1484
01:07:32,582 --> 01:07:36,220
We both bring unique skills
and talents to the table.

1485
01:07:36,253 --> 01:07:37,521
There's gonna be a difference

1486
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:39,289
between what's doable
and what's acceptable,

1487
01:07:39,323 --> 01:07:42,526
and this is something that
Elon is not gonna decide,

1488
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,027
this is not something
that Mark Zuckerberg

1489
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,862
is not gonna decide.

1490
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,265
This is you and I
and everybody else,

1491
01:07:48,298 --> 01:07:50,134
and hopefully that
will be translated

1492
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:52,169
eventually into a legislation.

1493
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,475
Elon Musk's assertion

1494
01:07:58,508 --> 01:08:02,112
that we're likely to be
living in a simulated reality

1495
01:08:02,146 --> 01:08:05,582
has popularized a theory
debated by philosophers,

1496
01:08:05,615 --> 01:08:08,885
and now gaining supporters
in Silicon Valley.

1497
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,387
Elon Musk has said

1498
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:13,957
that we're living in some kind
of computer, 3D simulation.

1499
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:15,992
I don't know if that
means we're in The Matrix,

1500
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:17,927
or some kind of a matrix.

1501
01:08:17,961 --> 01:08:22,232
And you know, as as bizarre
and crazy as that sounds.

1502
01:08:22,266 --> 01:08:24,234
Elon has been saying
bizarre and crazy things

1503
01:08:24,268 --> 01:08:27,237
that turned out to be
true for a long time now,

1504
01:08:27,271 --> 01:08:30,807
so, I would say um, maybe.

1505
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,809
Well, you never know do you?

1506
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:35,979
Well, disprove it,
we can't disprove it.

1507
01:08:36,012 --> 01:08:38,081
We could be of a
lower intelligence,

1508
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,649
and there could
be another species

1509
01:08:39,683 --> 01:08:42,852
far, far, far more
intelligent than us

1510
01:08:42,886 --> 01:08:45,422
and they're almost
playing God with us.

1511
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,257
It sounds ridiculous to
say something like that,

1512
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:49,259
but we don't know much.

1513
01:08:49,293 --> 01:08:51,761
We've barely left
our own planet.

1514
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:53,463
I felt like what
he was saying was,

1515
01:08:53,497 --> 01:08:56,099
that this is not base reality.

1516
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,835
And so, I would agree
with him on that front.

1517
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:01,004
You get labeled crazy
because you're pushing

1518
01:09:01,037 --> 01:09:04,107
the boundaries of
what people expect.

1519
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,544
He's coming at it from a
scientific perspective,

1520
01:09:07,577 --> 01:09:10,847
but that idea, that there's
only one true reality,

1521
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,817
and this isn't it, is
actually the underpinnings

1522
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:16,953
of all the ancient
religions of the world.

1523
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:18,722
All of those point to exactly

1524
01:09:18,755 --> 01:09:20,324
the same thing that he's saying,

1525
01:09:20,357 --> 01:09:22,359
so I'm with him.

1526
01:09:22,926 --> 01:09:25,128
I've been saying in my books,

1527
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,897
for a lot longer than Elon Musk,

1528
01:09:27,931 --> 01:09:33,403
that we live in the equivalent
of a massively advanced

1529
01:09:33,437 --> 01:09:36,673
virtual reality computer
game, in the end.

1530
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:44,581
And when you look at the
evidence, it is overwhelming,

1531
01:09:44,614 --> 01:09:47,351
certainly immensely compelling,

1532
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:49,686
and this is why
not just Elon Musk,

1533
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:51,755
many scientists now are
coming out and saying,

1534
01:09:51,788 --> 01:09:53,823
actually it does look like that.

1535
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:55,091
Ultimately for me it seems

1536
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:56,826
to be a bit of an
in-proveable theory.

1537
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,329
I mean how are we going to prove

1538
01:09:59,363 --> 01:10:01,998
that we're living in a
simulation, I don't know.

1539
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,167
Don't discount his wacko ideas,

1540
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:09,105
because suddenly they do pop
up in one shape or another,

1541
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:11,675
but I'm not sure
about that one, heh.

1542
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:14,611
I think we need to see more
meat on the bone on that one.

1543
01:10:14,644 --> 01:10:16,946
I think it's interesting that

1544
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:19,416
Musk is able to put
something like that out there

1545
01:10:19,449 --> 01:10:22,051
and show that what
others might consider

1546
01:10:22,085 --> 01:10:23,520
a bit of a ridiculous thought,

1547
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:25,922
or might be worried about
being ridiculed for,

1548
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:28,392
he's actually giving
serious thought to,

1549
01:10:28,425 --> 01:10:30,694
and I think what Musk
is always looking to do

1550
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:33,062
is to foster a discussion.

1551
01:10:36,566 --> 01:10:38,134
Inspired
by frustrations

1552
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:40,103
of sitting in a traffic jam,

1553
01:10:40,136 --> 01:10:43,407
Musk's solution was
The Boring Company.

1554
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:47,477
In 2018, the company was
selected to build a high speed

1555
01:10:47,511 --> 01:10:51,114
underground transportation
system in Chicago.

1556
01:10:51,147 --> 01:10:54,050
I would like to thank the
Mayor and the Mayor's Office,

1557
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,085
and the city of Chicago
for having the faith

1558
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:58,622
to bet on The Boring Company.

1559
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:03,293
We think we're gonna really
be very good at boring.

1560
01:11:04,861 --> 01:11:06,663
You could almost say that
Elon has the Midas touch,

1561
01:11:06,696 --> 01:11:09,065
because when he started
The Boring Company,

1562
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,601
which is really about
boring under the Earth

1563
01:11:11,635 --> 01:11:13,136
as opposed to being dull,

1564
01:11:13,169 --> 01:11:16,072
he actually started selling
baseball caps online

1565
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:17,341
before he did anything else,

1566
01:11:17,374 --> 01:11:19,108
and literally made
a million dollars.

1567
01:11:19,142 --> 01:11:21,411
You know, this is a guy
who everything he touches

1568
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:22,579
turns to gold.

1569
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:24,080
He's kept us all interested

1570
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:26,683
because he's
started tweeting out

1571
01:11:26,716 --> 01:11:29,118
offers of hats
and flamethrowers.

1572
01:11:29,152 --> 01:11:30,086
We were all interested to see

1573
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,688
what was gonna happen with it.

1574
01:11:31,721 --> 01:11:33,757
This is a difficult
thing that we're doing.

1575
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,091
It's a hard thing.

1576
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,125
It's a new thing.

1577
01:11:37,694 --> 01:11:42,699
And you, know I'd hope that
you'd cheer us on for this,

1578
01:11:43,567 --> 01:11:45,268
you know, because if we succeed,

1579
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,303
it's gonna be a great
thing for the city,

1580
01:11:47,337 --> 01:11:49,673
and if we if we fail, well,

1581
01:11:49,706 --> 01:11:53,510
I guess me and others will
lose a bunch of money.

1582
01:11:55,412 --> 01:11:56,446
Elon Musk is one of the great

1583
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,048
engineering minds of our time.

1584
01:11:59,082 --> 01:12:00,450
He is one of the
greatest business leaders

1585
01:12:00,484 --> 01:12:02,452
and entrepreneurs of our time,

1586
01:12:02,486 --> 01:12:05,221
and he is one of the great
visionaries of our time.

1587
01:12:07,924 --> 01:12:09,659
Elon will be remembered
as one of the guys

1588
01:12:09,693 --> 01:12:13,963
who was unafraid
to say, what else?

1589
01:12:13,997 --> 01:12:17,033
I think his greatest achievement
is inspiring humanity

1590
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:19,736
to think bigger,
to dream bigger.

1591
01:12:19,769 --> 01:12:22,205
In a world where there's
so many problems,

1592
01:12:22,238 --> 01:12:25,141
isn't it nice to have a
positive story occasionally?

1593
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:27,411
We're all sort of just
sitting back and watching

1594
01:12:27,444 --> 01:12:28,778
what's gonna come out next.
