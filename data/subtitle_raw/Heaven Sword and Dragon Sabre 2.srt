1
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:41,804
Love is like a net,
capturing heroes' hearts

2
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:49,872
Like a sword, vengeance cutting through
love and hate

3
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:57,515
Even heroes have to succumb

4
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:04,052
...to love and hate

5
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:11,998
Not even the Heaven Sword and Dragon Sabre

6
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:15,836
can disentangle love and hate

7
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:21,039
Hatred in the sea of love

8
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,945
Regrets in this life

9
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,953
filled with resentment and love

10
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:36,393
Who can answer what is love and hate

11
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,964
Heaven Sword and Dragon Sabre

12
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,002
are legendary weapons in the

13
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,571
martial arts world

14
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,936
They were created by

15
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,202
Guo Jing and Wang Yung

16
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,608
The legend says that at the end of
the Sung dynasty

17
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:56,341
Guo Jing and Wang Yung guarded
the Xian Yang

18
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,781
which fell to the enemy's hands

19
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,217
Knowing there was

20
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,084
no further hope

21
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,453
before their anticipated deaths

22
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,423
They secretly sought a famous sword smith

23
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,893
using the hardest quartz available
on earth

24
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:12,897
to amalgamate with hero Guo's heavy sabre

25
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:17,299
to create the Heaven Sword
and Dragon Sabre

26
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,895
As a result, for hundreds of years
martial artists

27
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,407
wanted to find out the secret and

28
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,172
possess these weapons,
to be the best of all

29
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,778
The Heaven Sword had been hidden with the

30
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,078
Er Mei School by heroine Guo

31
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,985
while the Dragon Sabre drifted from
one place to other

32
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,954
Our story follows the route to

33
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,582
finding the Dragon Sabre

34
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,603
After a hundred years, the sabre

35
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,171
came into the hands of Ming Cult

36
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,207
Lion King Tse Shun

37
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,173
who because of having stirred up hatred

38
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,245
hid in the Ice Fire Island

39
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,642
There was only one person who knew

40
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,374
of his whereabouts

41
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,313
And that was Chang Wu Ji

42
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,749
son of Wu Dong's fifth master
Chang Tsui San &

43
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,947
Yan So So, Yan Tin Jing of
the Eagle Clan's daughter

44
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,286
After Chang Wu Ji grew up

45
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:14,587
he met a few ladies

46
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,890
The pitiful Siu Chiu

47
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,559
His cousin Yan Li

48
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,796
Yang Bu Heui, left guardian of
the Ming Cult's daughter

49
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,032
Heroine Chou Chi Yeuk of Er Mei

50
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,368
who was infatuated by him

51
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:33,240
By chance he

52
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,405
accomplished the Jiu Yang kung fu

53
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:40,443
Unintentionally he fought many at
Summit Guang Ming

54
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,578
and thereby saved the Ming Cult

55
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,681
By which he became their leader

56
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,617
After that he re-built the cult

57
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:52,129
and escorted a team of heroes

58
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,565
to welcome back his godfather,
the Lion King

59
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:56,965
However on the way

60
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,334
he met a mysterious lady Chiu Ming

61
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:05,972
who poisoned the Ming Cult's heroes

62
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,809
and went to Wu Dong disguised as
Ming Cult's leader

63
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,281
and injured Chang San Fang

64
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,915
To save Chang San Fang

65
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,646
Wu Ji sought Chiu Ming

66
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,483
to get the antidote

67
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,292
What antidote? What do you mean?

68
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,360
What's wrong with you,
we haven't finished our talk

69
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,523
why have you attacked already?

70
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,302
I really don't understand

71
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,963
why you have repeatedly challenged
Ming Cult

72
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:33,970
Who on earth are you?

73
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,574
I don't understand it either

74
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,610
Have you come for the antidote

75
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,202
or to find out about me?

76
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,009
To get the antidote, naturally

77
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,981
Then you don't have to care who I am

78
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,143
In any event you'll know one day

79
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,750
Alright, if you want the antidote

80
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:50,982
you have to accede to three requests

81
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:51,613
Three requests?

82
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:52,281
Hmm!

83
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,518
What are they?

84
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,790
I don't have anything concrete now

85
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,386
When I do, I'll tell you

86
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,692
Alright, I promise you...

87
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,130
as long as they are not immoral

88
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,098
Give me the antidote

89
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,901
I have sent it to Mt. Wu Dong

90
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,828
Has the antidote arrived?

91
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:06,870
Not yet

92
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,406
Your grace...

93
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,602
You're here, what should we do?

94
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,680
Chiu Ming said the antidote
has been delivered

95
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,614
Oh, Mister, when we were at the gate

96
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,185
Someone gave me a letter to pass on to you

97
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,053
This is not the antidote

98
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,994
The antidote is in the golden box
compartment

99
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,656
And the prescription within
the pearl flower's hollow

100
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:33,629
Mister

101
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,327
The antidote is really here

102
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,496
May I bother you to get...

103
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:42,130
the prescription ready for use to
the Grand Teacher

104
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,572
Yes

105
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,410
Right, have you found out

106
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,342
what I have asked you to investigate?

107
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:48,937
Yes

108
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,414
The 6 clans which came down from
Summit Guang Ming

109
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,212
have all fallen into the trap

110
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,684
of the Yuan generals

111
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,722
They are now locked in the Man Fat Temple

112
00:05:58,324 --> 00:05:59,416
Man Fat Temple

113
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,653
That temple is the residence of
the western evil monk

114
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,560
and accommodates highly skilled
Yuan fighters

115
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,390
Let's take a look

116
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,262
Alright

117
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,152
Sir, please

118
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,193
What is it?

119
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:39,321
The prince is here & invites you all
to the main hall

120
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,194
Alright

121
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,532
Let's go

122
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,651
You wait for them at the tavern

123
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,879
I'll take charge here

124
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,478
Hero Ho, how come you're here?

125
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,848
We got ambushed

126
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,378
There are others up there

127
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:40,987
Seniors

128
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,755
Uncles

129
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:44,693
How come you are here too?

130
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,527
After leaving Summit Guang Ming

131
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,000
...we were poisoned at the tavern

132
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,936
We feel so very weak now

133
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,703
All of Er Mei's men are up there

134
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,007
Abbess Mie Jiue, how come you are here
as well?

135
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,675
Where's Chi Yeuk?

136
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,419
There's an intruder!

137
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:17,627
I'll get some men

138
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:29,936
Don't move

139
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,766
There are good fighters here,
come with me quickly

140
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,876
Thank you for saving me. What's your name?

141
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,254
You'll know in a while

142
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,982
Go to the Green Willow Mansion quickly

143
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,648
and free Chou Chi Yeuk

144
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,794
Miss Chou,

145
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,196
I hear you are the best pupil of Mie Jiue

146
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,961
So you must know about the secret

147
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,535
of Er Mei's Heaven Sword

148
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,236
I don't

149
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,239
How could the real sword be with her?

150
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,671
If you don't tell me honestly

151
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,007
about the secret of the Heaven Sword

152
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,913
I'll cut your face three times with
this sword

153
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,816
Are you going to tell me?

154
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,216
I don't know

155
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,184
Alright

156
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:26,028
Chang Wu Ji

157
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,280
Tell Chang to leave if you're smart

158
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:48,444
He can't take you with him now

159
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:52,554
Stop

160
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:01,463
Master Chang, I appreciate your
good intention

161
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:02,727
However I'd rather you went to
the Man Fat Temple

162
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,804
and save the six clans

163
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:10,907
Right, do you remember

164
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,739
you promised me right here

165
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,142
to do 3 things for me?

166
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,811
Now I have the Heaven Sword

167
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,009
The first thing I want you to do is

168
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,109
get the Dragon Sabre

169
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,118
Not now

170
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,381
Why?

171
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,513
That's because...

172
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,359
Because you've to go to
Man Fat Temple to save lives

173
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,324
Right?

174
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,689
That's none of your business

175
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,160
After 3 days

176
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,924
If Miss Chou is here

177
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,659
and safe, I promise you

178
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,200
I'll take you to the Dragon Sabre

179
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:39,304
Come, men

180
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,394
Yes

181
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,764
Take her back to Man Fat Temple

182
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:43,705
Yes

183
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,205
Frankly, I hope you'll die here

184
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,279
Chi Yeuk, come here

185
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,078
Teacher

186
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:54,510
What's your wish?

187
00:10:56,555 --> 00:11:00,491
Being captured by the Yuan's monk
this time has

188
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:03,790
caused me my good reputation

189
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,864
I don't want to leave this tower

190
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:12,368
But Er Mei cannot be without a leader

191
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,929
I want to make you Er Mei's
fourth generation head

192
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:18,510
No, Teacher, I'm still young

193
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,543
Shut up

194
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,277
When have you become so indecisive?

195
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,043
I have my reasons for doing this

196
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,543
Chou Chi Yeuk, pay attention

197
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:28,847
Yes

198
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:38,491
Er Mei's third generation leader Mie Jiue

199
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,622
has passed on the leadership to

200
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,793
the fourth pupil Chou Chi Yeuk

201
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,735
Come forward and listen

202
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:01,942
You again

203
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:04,984
That's right

204
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,253
Who are you anyway?

205
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,890
The Monk Fu under Chiu Ming

206
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:14,829
He is Fan Yiu, the Right Guardian
of the Ming Cult

207
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,129
who has disappeared for 10 years

208
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,803
Then who is Miss Chiu?

209
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,429
She is the daughter of the Prince
of Yue Yang

210
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,871
What's she doing here?

211
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,444
The Prince decided to exterminate
various clans

212
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:29,343
and take control, so she sent
Chiu Ming down south

213
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,143
to grab the treasured weapons

214
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,478
Heaven Sword and Dragon Sabre

215
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,519
Then he sent his son Fufu Temuyi

216
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,986
to gather all the Yuan's monks
at Man Fat Temple

217
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,751
and poison the six clans on their way back

218
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,623
from fighting at Summit Guang Ming

219
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,458
and trapping them at Man Fat Temple

220
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,090
Then is there any way to save them?

221
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,428
First we need the antidote

222
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,229
Where is it?

223
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,997
It's always been with Yuan & Ming

224
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:52,661
You can steal it

225
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,670
No

226
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,132
But I did

227
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:11,748
Monk Fu, what's your business here
at this late hour?

228
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:12,986
Nothing

229
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,605
Pack up the body

230
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,470
Let's go up and save them

231
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:31,167
Okay

232
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:42,982
You help them, I'll go up

233
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:43,554
Alright

234
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,419
Bring some water, I have the antidote here

235
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:45,990
Antidote

236
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,115
How did you get it?

237
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,194
Don't ask, give it to them

238
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:49,693
After you've taken it

239
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:51,820
you need an hour to recover, quick

240
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:56,228
Abbess

241
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,198
The antidote is here

242
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,597
Chi Yeuk, help me

243
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,134
Sister, please bring a bowl of
antidote here

244
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,673
I have never taken a favour from
an evil cult

245
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:06,437
I won't drink

246
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,648
You're dying

247
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:11,408
and yet you're so stubborn

248
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,348
Can't you even rescind for the sake
of Er Mei?

249
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,654
I am not stopping them, but I won't drink

250
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,985
Intruder!

251
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,087
Damn, they need an hour

252
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,526
to recover their kung fu

253
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,097
The Yuan master fighters are here,
what's to be done?

254
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,960
Round them up

255
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:34,067
I don't think they could recover so soon

256
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,940
Archers ready, shoot on sight

257
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:37,838
Yes

258
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,509
Hey

259
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,611
The intruder in there,
come out and face your death

260
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,775
Chief, what should we do?

261
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,285
Let me stall them

262
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,615
In the meantime you try to open up
your meridian

263
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,882
Men from the Ming Cult are coming

264
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,048
Hey

265
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,886
Listen, if you still don't come out

266
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:56,757
I'll burn down the tower

267
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,090
Guardian Fan, please take control here

268
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:00,893
Okay

269
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:09,606
Who are you?

270
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,271
Chang Wu Ji, leader of the Ming Cult

271
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,171
Oh, you're the leader

272
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,608
That's why you are so powerful

273
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:33,727
Drink up

274
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,460
Miss Chou, please drink it

275
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:40,698
No

276
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,360
The Western Eighteen Dragon Formation

277
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,188
Your Highness

278
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,092
I just got news that

279
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,188
the people inside the tower
have got the antidote

280
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,392
and that Chang Wu Ji is the leader
of the Ming Cult

281
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,299
The Ming Cult will be here soon

282
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:20,497
I think it's best to get rid of them first

283
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,363
Right

284
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,442
Get ready to burn down the tower

285
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,305
Yes

286
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,381
Disaster...

287
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,747
They are getting ready to burn us down

288
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,343
They are pouring the oil inside

289
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,855
Wait, our powers have not yet returned

290
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,619
We'll die for sure if we jump down
the tower

291
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,786
Let's tear our clothes

292
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,694
and tie them together as a rope
to let us down

293
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,061
Good

294
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,413
Oh no...

295
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,151
The fire is eating its way up

296
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,920
Follow me

297
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,590
Quickly...

298
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,202
Look

299
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,038
Shoot

300
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:42,451
Uncle Yan

301
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:45,987
Uncle Yan

302
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:48,219
Bu Heui, what are you doing up here?

303
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,859
Bu Heui

304
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,795
Miss Yang

305
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:53,830
Bu Huei

306
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:54,728
How are you?

307
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,024
Miss Yang

308
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,466
At last she apologised to you on
her mother's behalf

309
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,268
Apologised? She hasn't done anything wrong

310
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,741
Bu Huei...

311
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,210
You're here

312
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:20,520
Who are they?

313
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,594
They are members of Ming Cult,
real good fighters

314
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,898
Your Highness, I think you'd better
leave first

315
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,169
What about the six clans?

316
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,301
We'll take care of them another time

317
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,908
The Ming Cult really lives up
to its reputation

318
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,210
The Yuan regime will not have peace
from now on, go

319
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,319
The Yuan's monks are all dead, come down

320
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,456
No, the ladder's on fire,
the ropes are burnt through

321
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,059
Make another rope

322
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:04,466
Quick...

323
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,764
There's not enough time

324
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:07,731
Then jump

325
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:08,771
Jump...

326
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,808
They haven't recovered their powers yet

327
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,399
They can'tjump

328
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,774
Chief, have eight of them jump each time

329
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,108
We'll catch them from below

330
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,549
Uncle Yan, jump eight by eight

331
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,879
We'll catch you

332
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,853
How can we jump?

333
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,185
They might not catch us

334
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:28,225
Hero Ho, one must have trust

335
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,191
There's only one option now

336
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,761
We must trust them

337
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,159
Master...

338
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:39,730
Are you alright?

339
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:40,896
Master

340
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,538
He is alright. Justjump

341
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,469
Jump

342
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,946
Jump

343
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,882
It's burning, jump

344
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,359
Jump quickly

345
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,987
Abbess, Miss Chou

346
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,396
the fire has made its way up

347
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,870
I have said good and evil don't mix

348
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,202
I'd never take a favour from an evil cult

349
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,242
Since we have not recovered our powers

350
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:21,005
we're as good as dead if we jump

351
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,341
Hero Yan, go quickly

352
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,643
There's no time, quick

353
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,719
Uncle Yan, Ching Shu, jump now

354
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,582
Ask Chi Yeuk to jump now

355
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,622
The fire will consume everything

356
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:34,817
Come down quickly

357
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,660
Jump quickly, hero Yan, jump

358
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:40,528
Quick

359
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:44,227
Miss Chou

360
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,598
If you don't move it you'll not make it

361
00:21:45,704 --> 00:21:46,568
Go even if the Abbess doesn't

362
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:47,468
No... I won't go

363
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,563
If teacher is not going,
I'm not going even if I die

364
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,303
Abbess, are you going to let her die
with you?

365
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,350
No

366
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:01,976
You can't die

367
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,521
Er Mei's future is in your hands

368
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:05,248
Go

369
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:08,587
Jump

370
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,711
Teacher...

371
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,548
Why does she prefer death to my help?

372
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,678
Why does she hate us so much?

373
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:47,364
Teacher...

374
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:53,760
Miss Chou, you can't help her; she's dead!

375
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,306
You have to accept the situation

376
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,237
Chi Yeuk, get up

377
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,240
Don't cry any more

378
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:10,152
Listen... the six clans

379
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,223
have been fighting against the Ming Cult

380
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:15,225
Hero Chang has graciously

381
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:18,455
...saved our lives

382
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,758
While everyone is here I want to

383
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,232
recommend Chief Chang as leader
of all clans

384
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,360
to drive out the northern barbarians

385
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,700
What do you think?

386
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:29,899
Good...

387
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:30,804
I object

388
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,373
The Ming Cult is nevertheless an evil cult

389
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,209
How can they lead us?

390
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,304
Ching Shu, don't be reckless
with your words

391
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,647
Father, we should be

392
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,741
the leader of all clans

393
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:44,583
Why of all people choose a bastard son?

394
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:45,383
Nonsense

395
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,355
If you speak rubbish again I'll kill you

396
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,097
I don't believe it

397
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,497
I can't believe only Chang Wu Ji
can take the post

398
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,862
Sung Ching Shu...

399
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,404
Wu Ji, don't mind him

400
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,474
Listen to Monk Kung Man and

401
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,339
lead our fighters to drive out
the northern barbarians

402
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,573
I am too young for such an
important mission

403
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,012
Besides, I have to find someone

404
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,845
as I have promised to do something for her

405
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,816
Leader, didn't you say that you want

406
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,512
the Lion King back at the
Summit Guang Ming?

407
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:20,352
Yes, but now I've decided to go alone

408
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,256
You return to the Guang Ming Summit
& wait for my news

409
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,157
I have to go with leader since

410
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,355
when Miss was alive she instructed me

411
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,864
...to take care of you

412
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,696
Okay, await me at the east coast's
Golden Sand beach

413
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:31,029
Yes

414
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,785
Chief Chang, you're a man of your word

415
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:59,561
Since you're here, Miss Chou must be
all right

416
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,498
Miss Chiu, the princess of Yuan,
you're odd

417
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,035
On one hand you orchestrated
a comprehensive ambush

418
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,728
to exterminate the six clans

419
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,137
On the other, you're playing music
under the moon light

420
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:14,074
To destroy the six schools is
my dad's business

421
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,841
while playing the instrument is my concern

422
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,382
Then you know what happened at
Man Fat Temple?

423
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:22,942
Of course, you saved all the people

424
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,181
and killed many Yuan fighters

425
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,558
Then why don't you

426
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,286
avenge those men I have killed?

427
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,354
Since they are not your match

428
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,660
Why should I bother with them?

429
00:25:57,422 --> 00:26:00,448
Right, now that you have released
all of them

430
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,322
You can take me to the Dragon Sword

431
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,597
Who could it be at this late hour?

432
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,134
There, that's the one

433
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,265
Leader Chou

434
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,238
It's you

435
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,904
Yes, It's me Sung Ching Shu

436
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,445
What do you want with me

437
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,378
at this late hour?

438
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,450
Something confidential which I want to
talk about

439
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,344
Leave us

440
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:29,181
Yes

441
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:40,188
How can you do this?

442
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:45,159
It's not a matter of whether we can

443
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,101
It's something we must do
for the sake of martial world

444
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:53,542
Are you willing to accept domination
by an evil cult?

445
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,209
Besides, as per my investigation,
Chang Wu Ji...

446
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:02,047
has agreed to lead Chiu Ming to
the Dragon Sword

447
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:07,186
It is obvious that the Ming Cult

448
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,886
is consorting with the Yuan Regime

449
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:10,825
How would you know?

450
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,624
Never mind

451
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,529
The two of them are

452
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,932
off to Ice Fire Island

453
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,494
Let's do it this way

454
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:23,506
If you need my assistance

455
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:26,042
Look for me at the Beggar Clan

456
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,074
Chang Wu Ji; Could he really...

457
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,076
Iove Chiu Ming & have conspired
with Yuan regime?

458
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,079
If you don't believe me

459
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,985
Take a look at Ice Fire Island

460
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:02,272
There is noise of fighting over there

461
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,222
The one coming for the Dragon Sabre

462
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:49,782
I've seen your kung fu style somewhere

463
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,260
Nonsense, we haven't met before

464
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:53,990
Hand over the Dragon Sabre

465
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:09,202
Wait

466
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,544
If I remember correctly

467
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,346
One of you here to grab the Dragon Sword

468
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:18,251
is the one of the four guardians
of Ming Cult

469
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,221
The Purple Gown Sea King Daisy

470
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:21,622
Daisy

471
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:22,891
How do you know?

472
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,985
You don't have to lie to me

473
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,361
To find out if you're from the
Ming Cult I deliberately

474
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:32,732
...showed a loophole to lure you
to kill me

475
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,737
But you couldn't bear to do it

476
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:36,773
It's because apart from those
from the Ming Cult

477
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:40,743
everyone in the martial arts world
wants to kill me

478
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:42,608
And in the Ming Cult

479
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,478
the only woman whose kung fu

480
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,347
is comparable to mine is you

481
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,921
I little realised that while I have fooled

482
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,149
so many others

483
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:56,159
I have failed to fool you
despite being blind

484
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,888
I really don't understand

485
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:01,056
why you want the Dragon Sabre?

486
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:05,130
For the same reason I came from
Persia to China

487
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:07,204
I have to urgently find the

488
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,797
Chian Kuen shifting Technique
of the former leader

489
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,434
I suspect he hid it in the Dragon Sabre

490
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:16,947
15 years ago at Summit Guang Ming

491
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,606
You have left the Cult

492
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:19,410
Now what do you want

493
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:22,179
with the leader's holy manual?

494
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:26,189
Tse, you don't know the story behind this

495
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:30,856
I was a holy maid of the Ming Cult

496
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,691
and was sent forth to the central region

497
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:36,198
to retrieve the manual for
guarding the cult

498
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,765
Who would have thought that

499
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:44,035
in saving Master Yang 20 years ago

500
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:48,442
a doomed affair started

501
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:50,070
I know about this

502
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,479
You left the Ming cult because

503
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,609
of your marriage with Mr. Ngan Yip

504
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:58,116
Because of this I broke the commandment

505
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,885
of the Persian cult

506
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,918
Because as a holy maid of the cult

507
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,622
I wasn't supposed to marry

508
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:12,759
For 15 years I drifted in
the central region

509
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:17,274
in search of the Chian Kuen
shifting Technique

510
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,842
to atone for my transgression

511
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:22,879
What? You've travelled across
central region

512
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:26,246
Haven't you heard of any
Chang Wu Ji's news?

513
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,648
Grand Teacher

514
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,447
Chang Wu Ji was Ah Niu

515
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,112
who bit my hand when I was mad

516
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,156
Oh, it's him

517
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:35,582
Hey, come out

518
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,523
What are you looking at?
Come out, all of you

519
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:48,237
Strange, why are there only
three sets of footsteps?

520
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,465
Where's the other one?

521
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,809
There're only three of us

522
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,846
No, I distinctly heard breathing
of four people

523
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:56,845
Right

524
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:58,876
There's me as well

525
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:01,917
Chi Yeuk

526
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,050
How did you come here?

527
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,121
I got news that

528
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:05,450
you brought Chiu Ming here

529
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:06,784
For the sake of the martial arts world

530
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,688
I have to come and see

531
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,959
No matter what happens

532
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,088
you two have re-united

533
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:30,372
Daisy, you needn't go

534
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,766
Your kung fu is excellent,
how should I address you?

535
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,563
I am messenger of Cloud of
the Persian Ming Cult

536
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:57,971
The other two are messengers of
Wind & Moon

537
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,738
We're here to bring back Daisy

538
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:03,040
because she's lost her virginity
and transgressed

539
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,173
Besides we want her to hand over
the manual

540
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:07,114
Wait

541
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,746
She doesn't have it

542
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,116
It's with Chang Wu Ji

543
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,700
Chian Kuen shifting Technique

544
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,972
From where did you acquire
our leader's kung fu?

545
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,635
I am Chang Wu Ji and I discovered
by accident

546
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:35,872
the manual written on sheep's skin

547
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,379
in the secret chamber of the Ming Cult

548
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:38,471
I am now temporarily taking over

549
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:40,141
as the leader of the Ming Cult

550
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,785
Siu Chiu, how are you related to her?

551
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,288
I am her daughter

552
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:51,257
I've been disguising as a maid
at the Summit Guang Ming

553
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,729
to find the sheep's skin to save my mother

554
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,926
When I found the manual

555
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,004
My cover was to serve you

556
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:03,301
in order that I could use you

557
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,103
to help me protect the manual

558
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,604
So this explains why in the secret chamber

559
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,645
you knew how to paint blood
on the sheep's skin

560
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:12,238
Mr. Chang, forgive me. In my place...

561
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,284
you would have done the same thing

562
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,654
That's good. Since you're the leader
of the Ming Cult

563
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:21,020
then please execute Daisy

564
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,592
in accordance to the rule of the Ming Cult

565
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:44,607
Stop

566
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,385
Cloud, you are so merciless!

567
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,579
I think you're here for two purposes

568
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:53,122
The sheep's skin manual which I can
hand over to you

569
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:54,418
But as for the holy maid

570
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:55,651
you'd better find someone else
to replace her

571
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,422
Chief Chang, there's something
you didn't know

572
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,657
Our holy maid pledged allegiance
with her blood

573
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,996
Unless Daisy spills all her blood

574
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,037
to another girl

575
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:10,665
We can never regard her as the holy maid

576
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:15,444
What if a girl has the same blood

577
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,138
...as Daisy?

578
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,647
Of course that will do

579
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,322
Siu Chiu

580
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,803
Holy maid, please go on board

581
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,113
Mother, I am going

582
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,312
Alright

583
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:03,220
Come back

584
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,921
if you feel Ionely and alone

585
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:08,464
Mother will always be at your side

586
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:16,536
Mother, I'll never come back

587
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,837
Go and say goodbye to her

588
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,081
Siu Chiu

589
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,384
Mr. Chang

590
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,055
The sun is going down, please go on board

591
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,430
Siu Chiu

592
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,762
I'll never forget you

593
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:53,600
No need, it's too far away

594
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,054
What are you talking about?

595
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:14,359
The Yuan princess wanted to borrow
my Dragon Sabre

596
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,399
Yes, I promised her

597
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:17,893
The purpose of my coming here
is to bring you

598
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,527
back to take over the leadership
of the Ming Cult

599
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,731
Secondly, I would like to borrow
your Dragon Sabre

600
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,171
so the princess could look at it
for an hour

601
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:26,266
Are you saying that the Heaven Sword

602
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,208
is now in the hands of Chiu?

603
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,677
Yes

604
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:33,313
If she finds out the embedded secret...

605
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,408
in the Heaven Sword
& the Dragon Sabre, then the...

606
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,545
Yuan regime will be able to
conquer the martial world

607
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,716
By that time, you will be blamed
by everyone

608
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:55,768
It's lucky that the Dragon Sabre
is still here

609
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,400
I'll think about it tonight

610
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,307
and let you know of my decision tomorrow

611
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:13,988
How come I awoke so late?

612
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:14,989
It's almost noon

613
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,758
Why am I so weak?

614
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,196
What's going on? Damn

615
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,228
Godfather, wake up

616
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,565
What happened to you?

617
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:34,374
I am weak. It looks like I've been drugged

618
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:39,483
Chi Yeuk

619
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,782
What happened to you?

620
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,084
Who beat you like this?

621
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:45,121
I don't know, when I woke up I saw blood

622
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,882
Two other persons are missing

623
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,152
Who?

624
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,752
Yesterday there were 5 of us here

625
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:56,094
Now I can only hear the breathing
of 3 people

626
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:05,500
Cousin...

627
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,736
What? Yan Li is dead

628
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:08,675
Where's Chiu?

629
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:09,803
Dragon Sabre

630
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:10,778
Dragon Sabre?

631
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:19,585
It's gone

632
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:20,985
Dragon Sabre is gone

633
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,423
Chiu Ming took it

634
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,254
What?

635
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,261
What a ruthless woman

636
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,001
When I first met her

637
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:45,048
she told me she liked to die in the sea

638
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:50,484
Wu Ji, you are too careless

639
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:54,615
Think about it, Chiu Ming
is the princess of Yuan

640
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,716
She used poison

641
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,692
in the Man Fat Temple before

642
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:01,390
But I still don't understand

643
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,262
why she did this?

644
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:04,398
Why?

645
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,436
She wants to have the Heaven Sword
& the Dragon Sabre

646
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,164
Then why didn't she kill us all?

647
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,866
Wu Ji, listen

648
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:13,910
I am your godfather, I want you to go back

649
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,501
and look for Chiu Ming

650
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:16,944
Yes, godfather

651
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,373
Why didn't you use the Jiu Yang kung fu

652
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:21,542
to help us counteract the poison?

653
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,449
Godfather, the poison

654
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,818
gathers in the diaphragm

655
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,448
To counteract the poison,
you've to start from there

656
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,652
Godfather, you're a man, of course
it won't bother you

657
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,752
But Sister Chi Yeuk is a lady

658
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,490
I can't ask her to take off the clothes

659
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,690
...in order that I can exercise my power

660
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:40,036
Wu Ji, Miss Chou has got to be saved

661
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,105
Hence let me make the decision

662
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:45,698
...that you two will get married

663
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,505
What do you say, Miss Chou?

664
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,280
I'm but a mere orphan

665
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:55,045
How can I decide for myself?

666
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,024
Good, if you can't decide

667
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,524
then I'll decide for you

668
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,958
This marriage is confirmed

669
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,128
Wu Ji, I'll go back with you immediately

670
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,290
to look for Chiu Ming

671
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:41,961
You are back

672
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:42,657
Where's Godfather?

673
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:43,926
He's in the room and hasn't come out yet

674
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:48,567
Godfather

675
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,936
Have you found the antidote yet?

676
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:54,840
There's no news about the Prince
of Yue Yang's men

677
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:57,675
but I've seen many men from
the Beggar Clan

678
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:03,012
I wonder what's up with the Beggar Clan?

679
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,024
Someone's outside

680
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:28,545
Who are you?

681
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,245
What? It's you

682
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,677
You should be ashamed of yourself

683
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:40,518
I don't blame you for stealing
Heaven Sword & Dragon Sabre,

684
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,184
neither for dumping us
at the Ice Fire Island

685
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,785
But Cousin Yan Li

686
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,227
doesn't deserve to be treated like this

687
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,798
Did Chou Chi Yeuk wrong you...

688
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:49,627
such that she deserved to be
killed by you?

689
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,798
Chang Wu Ji, I lured you here to...

690
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,739
let you know that I was not
responsible for

691
00:42:59,843 --> 00:43:00,832
what happened over at the Ice Fire Island

692
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,435
There were only 5 people there

693
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:05,310
Apart from the one who died
& one who was injured

694
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,383
...there were just you, me and
my godfather

695
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:07,882
If it's not you, who else could it be?

696
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,317
I know that you won't believe what I say

697
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,718
Alright, you go back immediately

698
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,084
and find your godfather

699
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,385
Then you will know the whole truth

700
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,050
Alright, wait for me here

701
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:28,961
What? You again

702
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,384
Godfather

703
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:46,381
Godfather

704
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:52,360
Chi Yeuk...

705
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,129
Beggar Clan

706
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:04,233
Drink it...

707
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,079
That way...

708
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:23,015
Deputy head of the Beggar Clan Si Foh Lung

709
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:25,994
toasts to Hero Sung

710
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:30,328
and the leader of Er Mei Heroine Chou

711
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:31,964
Please

712
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,031
Head of the Bowl

713
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:36,970
Head of the Stick

714
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:37,563
Yes

715
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,607
- Follow me
- Yes

716
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:45,005
Brothers, quiet please...

717
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:47,709
Please come forward...

718
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:52,052
The reason for having this meeting

719
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:53,316
of the Beggar Clan from the
9 provinces is that

720
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,756
the retired old leader

721
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,488
has got a sealed letter to
Hero Sung of Wu Dong

722
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:03,362
asking us to join force with Wu Dong
and Er Mei

723
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:06,630
And if necessary to acquire help
from the Yuan regime

724
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:08,534
in order to destroy the Ming Cult

725
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:10,564
Why didn't you bring along...

726
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:13,336
the Jade Dog Stick, the leader's token?

727
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:16,845
Yes...

728
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,018
Quiet, listen to me

729
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:26,521
The old leader was supposed to...

730
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:28,784
let me bring the Stick here

731
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,383
But the Stick

732
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,190
would never be given to outsiders

733
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:35,765
Secondly, it might get lost on the way

734
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,424
that's why it wasn't brought here

735
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:45,237
How come...

736
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:46,707
I am Chang Wu Ji from the Ming Cult

737
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:48,141
Has Tse Shun the Lion King and

738
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,735
Miss Chou of Er Mei been here?

739
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,403
Chang Wu Ji...

740
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:57,086
Chang Wu Ji,

741
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:58,848
you are looking for death

742
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,617
Set up the Dog Killing Formation

743
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:09,026
Attack

744
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:14,424
Wait

745
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:17,091
Chang Wu Ji, you'd better surrender

746
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:19,101
or Miss Chou will be killed

747
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:23,537
Grab him

748
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,644
What's happening...

749
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:41,021
Who are you?

750
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:47,122
The Stick?

751
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,967
It's the leader's Jade Dog Stick

752
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:56,301
True, it's like the imperial seal
of the Beggar Clan

753
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:58,499
Followers of the Beggar Clan
kneel to receive orders

754
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,074
The deputy head of the Beggar Clan
Si Foh Lung

755
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,842
conspired with Sung Ching Shu,
Yuan regime's spy

756
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,850
to forge a letter from the old leader
hoping that our

757
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:12,217
Clan will surrender to Yuan
& go against the Ming Cult

758
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:15,655
I have been sent to clarify the matter

759
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,351
and bring Si Foh Lung to justice

760
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,401
Si Foh Lung, whose idea is it...

761
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,841
to betray the Beggar Clan?

762
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:39,509
It's... it's Sung Ching Shu

763
00:48:39,616 --> 00:48:41,777
He gave me a million taels of gold

764
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:44,012
to buy off the Beggar Clan

765
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:47,386
He's the mastermind

766
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:48,458
I have nothing to do with it

767
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,020
Where's Sung?

768
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:54,359
Brothers... Iook around

769
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:56,261
and bring Sung back

770
00:48:56,366 --> 00:48:57,230
Go...

771
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:58,460
Luckily you've come in time

772
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:00,433
otherwise the Beggar Clan will bear
the shame forever

773
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:03,802
Who are you? We hope to repay you
some other time

774
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:06,899
No need, your welfare is my concern

775
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,274
You'll know who I am in time

776
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:10,607
Arrest the traitor first

777
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:11,544
Yes...

778
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:12,745
Take him away

779
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,146
Go...

780
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:20,248
Chief Chang, please forgive

781
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:21,756
our misbehaviour

782
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:23,519
You have saved my life

783
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,424
I should thank you for this

784
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:26,018
You are...

785
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,096
No need to ask

786
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:30,064
We may meet again if there's a chance

787
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,794
If not, why bother to remember

788
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:33,369
one more girl's name?

789
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,737
Could it be her?

790
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,498
But it can't be

791
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,003
Chief Chang, you'd better

792
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,307
release Miss Chou's vital points

793
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:54,487
What is it?

794
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,090
That's strange, there's a blast of
mysterious energy

795
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:00,095
coming from your body that resists
my Jiu Yang kung fu

796
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:01,892
You've have been hit by the freezing palm?

797
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:02,727
Me?

798
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,789
No

799
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:07,397
How come you and my godfather

800
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,131
landed into their hands?

801
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,800
I don't know

802
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:14,570
I only remember when I was sleeping
at the inn

803
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,373
...someone slipped in

804
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,038
and paralyzed me

805
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:19,206
When I woke up

806
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:20,783
I was at the Beggar Clan

807
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:22,044
Where's my godfather now?

808
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:25,954
You are always thinking about
your godfather

809
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:29,217
I don't mean that

810
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:31,055
But on the day when you disappeared

811
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:32,219
Chiu Ming came to me

812
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:34,092
and told me something strange

813
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,186
What did she say?

814
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:37,858
Said she didn't do what happened
at Ice Fire island

815
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:39,458
If not her, who else could it be?

816
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:41,935
Chi Yeuk, let me tell you

817
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,167
my godfather has a disorder

818
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:47,800
When he has an attack he can do anything

819
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:50,141
...without realising it himself

820
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:53,216
I am afraid that...

821
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:56,881
I understand. After listening to Chiu Ming

822
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:59,547
...you wanted to clear her name

823
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:00,816
Think about it

824
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:02,084
If your godfather was the murderer

825
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:04,183
who poisoned him?

826
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:06,025
That's true

827
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:09,158
Chi Yeuk, I feel that things
in the martial arts world

828
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:10,699
are getting more and more complicated

829
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,559
I hope that after I have saved
my godfather

830
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:13,897
You and I can retire to the mountain...

831
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:15,869
& not be bothered by matters
in the martial arts world

832
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:17,837
But, will you still...

833
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:19,909
Iove me then?

834
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,637
Why not?

835
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,440
Right, after coming back from
Man Fat Temple

836
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,014
I've promised followers of
the Ming Cult to return

837
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,106
immediately after I've gone
to the Ice Fire Island

838
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:29,685
When I return to the Summit Guang Ming

839
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:30,844
...we will get married immediately

840
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,761
Bow to the heaven

841
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:49,633
Wait

842
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:55,812
Chiu Ming

843
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,551
Ms Chiu, today is the big day
for our leader

844
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:03,983
and the head of Er Mei

845
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:05,418
Ms Chiu, have a seat please

846
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:08,389
I'll raise you a toast later

847
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:11,089
I need to have a few words
with Chief Chang

848
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:13,424
Speak your mind then leave

849
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:16,756
Ms Chiu, we can wait

850
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,334
until after the wedding

851
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:19,732
It'll be too late

852
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,065
Princess, there're ups and downs in life

853
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:28,303
You have to face the reality

854
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:29,810
Why do you think I am here?

855
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:35,582
Chang Wu Ji, do you mean what you said?

856
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:36,344
Of course

857
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,250
That day when I gave you the antidote

858
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,152
You promised to do 3 things for me

859
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:42,782
Firstly, I want to borrow the Dragon Sabre

860
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,155
I've brought you to the Ice Fire Island

861
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:45,489
Where's the Dragon Sabre?

862
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:47,790
You'll find out

863
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,763
Now I want you to do the second thing
for me

864
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:50,798
What is it?

865
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:53,734
You cannot marry Chi Yeuk today

866
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:56,936
What?

867
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,439
I can't

868
00:52:58,542 --> 00:52:59,406
It was agreed that...

869
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,874
I won't do anything dishonourable

870
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:03,969
If you marry her, you'll be unfilial
and dishonourable

871
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,514
Miss Chiu, I respect you

872
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:07,674
as my guest today

873
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:09,809
I won't tolerate anymore
if you keep talking rubbish

874
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,218
Then you refuse...

875
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:13,983
to do the second thing for me

876
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,148
Sorry

877
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,426
Look what I've got on my hands

878
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:20,255
What?

879
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:23,662
If you want to get it

880
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:24,631
...follow me now

881
00:53:25,735 --> 00:53:26,531
Please stay

882
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:30,165
Ms Chiu

883
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,798
Either you go with me
or you go get married

884
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:39,138
Alright, I'll go with you

885
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,883
Don't do that...

886
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:50,089
Chi Yeuk, you...

887
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:06,636
Don't do that

888
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,233
Stop fighting

889
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,807
Hey, how come your kung fu became
so good?

890
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:14,645
None of your business

891
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,616
Chang Wu Ji, don't come back to me...

892
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,846
if you leave today

893
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,858
Chi Yeuk, this has something to do
with my godfather

894
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:28,328
My godfather has done a great favor to me

895
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,864
Please forgive me

896
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:30,660
Go

897
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:32,797
Chang Wu Ji

898
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:36,937
Chang Wu Ji...

899
00:54:41,745 --> 00:54:44,908
Everybody, you all witness

900
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:48,473
that he is ungrateful to me

901
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:51,713
From this day onwards, I will have...

902
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,049
nothing to do with him

903
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:57,291
Don't run

904
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:01,222
Tell me

905
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:02,525
Where did you get that thing?

906
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:05,263
You can tell...

907
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:07,666
this is the hair of your godfather
Lion King

908
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:08,965
Of course I can see that

909
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:10,198
In the martial arts world
he's the only one with...

910
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,707
blonde hair while practising
the Lion Roaring kung fu

911
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:14,301
Do you know where he is?

912
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:15,400
Of course I do

913
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:17,343
If not, how could I get his hair?

914
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:18,974
Where is he?

915
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:20,106
In Shaolin temple

916
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,978
We have nothing here

917
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,249
We can only offer you some plain rice

918
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:28,415
Thank you

919
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:30,186
The night is cold

920
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,625
You should cover yourself well

921
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:34,424
Thank you, we'll just stay here
for one night

922
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:35,361
We'll leave tomorrow

923
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:36,864
Don't take too much trouble

924
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:38,160
Oh, no trouble at all

925
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:39,929
Alright, get some rest

926
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:41,401
You look tired

927
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,493
Sleep early

928
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:43,435
Alright...

929
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:45,902
Goodbye

930
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,101
Alright... get some rest

931
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:51,873
Does it hurt?

932
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:52,675
Yes

933
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,212
Since it's not too far away from Shaolin

934
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:57,251
...you take some rest

935
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,288
Let me go there to investigate by myself

936
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,220
"Temple Grand Hall"

937
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,227
You are here

938
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:08,728
Follow me

939
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:14,634
Shing Kwun

940
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,755
Greetings to Grand teachers

941
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:11,216
You are back

942
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:12,055
Yes

943
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,458
Yuen Chun

944
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,656
Yes

945
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:22,869
You brought the Lion King Tse Shun
back to Shaolin

946
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:27,375
& invited all martial heroes for
the Tuen Ng Festival

947
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:32,608
to fight against the Dragon Sabre
and Tse Shun

948
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:39,120
We'd like to listen to your reasons
for doing this

949
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:39,984
Yes

950
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:44,156
Yuen Chun, the 3 of us have retired
for many years

951
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,194
and haven't been bothered by
secular matters

952
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,457
If Tse Shun deserves death...

953
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:52,729
why don't you just kill him?

954
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:55,066
Why bother to put him under
the rock of Amitabha

955
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:57,537
and let us guard him for you?

956
00:57:57,941 --> 00:57:59,932
For the battle at the Man Fat Temple

957
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:04,571
Shaolin owes the Ming Cult leader a favour

958
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:08,378
What are we going to do
if the leader comes?

959
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,248
That's why all martial artists

960
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:13,447
are invited to this assembly, where...

961
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:17,959
Tse Shun's fate will judged by
central region's schools

962
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:21,588
Even if Chang Wu Ji comes for him

963
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:24,064
We are not responsible for it

964
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:27,232
At the Summit Guang Ming

965
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,328
Chang Wu Ji once said that

966
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:32,931
you have something to do with

967
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:34,976
Tse Shun becoming enemies
with the six clans

968
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:36,010
In fact,

969
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:39,741
we can ask Tse Shun about this

970
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,510
But he has refused to talk

971
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:43,779
since he arrived

972
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:46,788
Therefore only you can explain the case

973
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,487
He's been talking nonsense

974
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:52,117
Don't bother, Chang Wu Ji
will definitely be here

975
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:55,129
for the Assembly

976
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:57,791
We can talk this over then

977
00:58:57,901 --> 00:58:59,198
It's late now

978
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:01,497
You should go back

979
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:03,333
- Yes, Uncle
- Grand Teachers

980
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:27,187
Who is it? Please show up
& have a seat here

981
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:34,360
I am Chang Wu Ji, the leader
of the Ming Cult

982
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,028
Greetings to you

983
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:38,369
Chief Chang, are you here

984
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,669
for the Lion King?

985
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:44,608
The Lion King is my godfather,
I am here for him

986
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:29,714
It has been said that the Ming Cult leader

987
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:32,351
is powerful in his kung fu,
now I know it's true

988
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:36,193
I was Dao Ngai the former Abbot of Shaolin

989
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,561
He is Dao Jit

990
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:38,793
He is Dao Nan

991
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:40,999
I apologize for having offended you

992
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:43,335
We three brothers

993
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:45,703
have sworn before the Buddha to guard

994
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:49,505
Tse Shun until the Assembly

995
01:00:49,612 --> 01:00:52,342
This is for the honour of Shaolin

996
01:00:52,448 --> 01:00:55,349
Please forgive us

997
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:56,383
Wu Ji

998
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:00,383
Wu Ji, come over

999
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,481
I need to talk to you

1000
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:06,256
Please

1001
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,889
Godfather...

1002
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:13,435
I've been staying under the rock
in the past few months

1003
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:16,596
listening to the prayers of these 3 monks

1004
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:20,301
Looking back, I feel that
I have deeply sinned

1005
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:23,311
and deserve all this!

1006
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:24,641
There is one thing

1007
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:27,181
which I still don't understand

1008
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:29,183
Even if you are coming to save me today

1009
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:30,912
I won't go with you

1010
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,716
You'd better leave

1011
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:38,522
Chief Chang, it seems you'll
have to wait till...

1012
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:40,493
the Tuen Ng Festival if you want to
save the Lion King

1013
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:48,164
Chiu Ming

1014
01:01:54,177 --> 01:01:55,906
Chiu Ming...

1015
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:58,405
How come it's you?

1016
01:01:58,514 --> 01:01:59,242
Shhh!

1017
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:01,313
How come you are there alone?

1018
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:03,112
After you left, I saw

1019
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,618
someone jump down

1020
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,053
That's why I hid myself outside

1021
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:08,214
and waited till you came back

1022
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:09,154
Did you know that the 2 elderly couple

1023
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:10,156
were already dead?

1024
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:10,850
What?

1025
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:33,745
Who are you?

1026
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:36,444
We have been instructed to kill
Chang Wu Ji

1027
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:38,411
Who instructed you? Speak

1028
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:43,253
It's him

1029
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:03,245
Are you alright?

1030
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:05,075
That's strange, this person is good
in kung fu

1031
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:06,705
and has practised the Jiu Yin kung fu

1032
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:08,010
The power of my Jiu Yang kung fu

1033
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,106
was absorbed to it

1034
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,510
I've seen this person before

1035
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,884
The day I found you at the inn

1036
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,354
He struck me down the cliff

1037
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,947
Luckily I fell on a tree

1038
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:17,548
or else I would have died

1039
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,094
Who was he?

1040
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:22,157
He must be the murderer
at the Ice Fire Island

1041
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:23,857
To silence me off he is after my back

1042
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,298
That's right, what's the situation
at Shaolin?

1043
01:03:26,402 --> 01:03:28,393
My godfather is in Shaolin

1044
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,171
That's strange,
how do you know he's there?

1045
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:33,333
After leaving Man Fat Temple,
Ching Shu betrayed...

1046
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:35,501
Wu Dong and swore allegiance
to the Yuan regime

1047
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:37,909
Therefore I know what he's done

1048
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,173
The day when you saved Miss Chou
from the Beggar Clan

1049
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:44,447
...he took the Lion King away
from the back door

1050
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:45,680
and gave him up to Shing Kwun

1051
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,248
Shing Kwun brought your godfather back

1052
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:49,984
...to Shaolin to claim credit

1053
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:52,219
That was why I took you away from
your wedding

1054
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,955
In order to save my godfather

1055
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:55,189
I'll take you home to dress your wounds

1056
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:56,629
and then rush back to the Assembly

1057
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:59,200
"Lion Killing Assembly"

1058
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:05,101
Everyone in Shaolin is honoured

1059
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:08,837
to have you all present here

1060
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:11,209
No need to stand on ceremony...

1061
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:15,544
Tse Shun has done great harm
to the martial arts world

1062
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:17,346
and is laden with sin

1063
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:22,447
We've caught him but do not wish
to claim credit alone

1064
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:25,686
That's why we have invited all heroes
to come

1065
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:27,285
...to settle this

1066
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:29,460
Er Mei school is here

1067
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,567
Sung Ching Shu

1068
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:36,662
I heard that since the
Summit Guang Ming incident...

1069
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:38,603
she and Sung Ching Shu were engaged

1070
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:41,034
Ching Shu...

1071
01:04:41,944 --> 01:04:44,469
Master Kung Man,

1072
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,707
please excuse my being late

1073
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:50,410
No problem at all, please sit

1074
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:04,894
Please...

1075
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:08,769
Alright

1076
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:10,896
Apart from the Beggar Clan

1077
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:16,172
which is now electing a leader
and is unable to come

1078
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:19,942
All clans from the central region are here

1079
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:23,883
To be fair, each clan will send

1080
01:05:23,986 --> 01:05:26,921
a representative to

1081
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:31,221
fight in the competition

1082
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:34,524
Whoever wins in the final round

1083
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,825
will posses Tse Shun and his Dragon Sabre

1084
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,491
He can then go to the 3 Pine Peak

1085
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:42,799
to get Tse Shun,

1086
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,567
whose life and death will be from
then onwards

1087
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:48,371
of no concern to any other clans

1088
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:50,942
First Combat, Ming Cult against Kung Tung

1089
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:00,122
Ming Cult is the winner

1090
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:01,951
Second Combat, Kwun Lun against Wu Dong

1091
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:12,598
Wu Dong is the winner

1092
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:14,636
Third Combat, Shaolin against Hai Sha

1093
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,334
Shaolin is the winner

1094
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:24,174
Fourth Combat, Er Mei against Hua Shan

1095
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:30,512
Er Mei is the winner

1096
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:35,190
The results of the first round are

1097
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:37,418
Wu Dong, Ming Cult

1098
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:40,256
Shaolin, Er Mei are the winners,
lots are drawn

1099
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:42,923
First. Ming Cult against Shaolin

1100
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:47,826
Yuan Ip

1101
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,268
Teacher...

1102
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:53,472
This concerns Shaolin's reputation;
I'll fight myself

1103
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:56,039
Chief, let me...

1104
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:57,043
No need

1105
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:59,137
Master Kung Man is the Abbot of Shaolin

1106
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,182
Out of courtesy I should fight

1107
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:05,751
Master Kung Man, please

1108
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,379
I should be the one to ask you...

1109
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:09,390
to be merciful

1110
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:11,251
Please

1111
01:07:23,005 --> 01:07:25,872
Chief Chang, I believe that

1112
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:29,706
that is Shaolin's Dragon Fist

1113
01:07:29,812 --> 01:07:33,043
That's correct, my godfather taught me

1114
01:07:33,149 --> 01:07:34,207
If I win by chance, Shaolin Kung fu...

1115
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:36,409
won't be said to have lost to other school

1116
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:37,349
If I lose...

1117
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:39,387
I can only blame myself for not
learning well

1118
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:43,184
No matter what the outcome is

1119
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:47,023
I must thank you for your favours
to Shaolin

1120
01:07:48,330 --> 01:07:50,355
Abbot, no need for formalities, please

1121
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:51,296
Be careful of my attack

1122
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:15,946
Chief Chang, what a young hero!

1123
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:18,686
Please forgive me, I'm too eager to
save my godfather

1124
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:23,321
Next is Er Mei against Wu Dong

1125
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:28,098
Leader Chou, please

1126
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:29,734
Ching Shu

1127
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:30,635
Yes

1128
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:33,070
Ching Shu

1129
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:35,268
Please

1130
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:36,769
Ching Shu

1131
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:40,013
You're Wu Dong's student,
why are you helping Er Mei?

1132
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:43,845
Yan Lei Hang

1133
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,818
You must be mistaken

1134
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:46,979
I'm the future husband

1135
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:49,819
of the head of Er Mei

1136
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:52,485
I'm no longer the same old Sung Ching Shu

1137
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:54,028
Huh...

1138
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,655
No wonder your father fell sick

1139
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:57,663
when he heard you are engaged

1140
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:02,131
Ching Shu, although you are a new star...

1141
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:04,103
you shouldn't be using the kung fu
of Wu Dong

1142
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:05,400
to fight against Wu Dong

1143
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,139
What's so special about the kung fu
of Wu Dong?

1144
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:14,708
Everybody, listen

1145
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,785
Today I won't be using the kung fu

1146
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:19,411
of Wu Dong in the fight

1147
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:24,183
Alright, let's see...

1148
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:25,419
what kind of kung fu you are using?

1149
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:50,043
Yan Lei Hang, Wu Dong kung fu is outdated

1150
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:51,050
Don't boast!

1151
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,557
Ching Shu, your kung fu may not be able

1152
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:07,636
...to beat Wu Dong

1153
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:09,199
Get up

1154
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:16,442
Wait

1155
01:10:19,582 --> 01:10:21,413
The remaining parties

1156
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:24,509
should be the Ming Cult and Er Mei

1157
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,111
All other schools please step down

1158
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,713
But this bastard

1159
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:30,883
has wounded our Sixth Brother
from the back

1160
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:35,987
Ah? No body said that...

1161
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:38,828
there cannot be attack from the back

1162
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:40,565
Did anyone say that?

1163
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:41,658
Did anyone?

1164
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:45,336
Well...

1165
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:50,604
Chief Chang, it seems you put...

1166
01:10:50,713 --> 01:10:54,171
all your grudge to that attack

1167
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:55,875
But don't forget that

1168
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:58,920
you are the one who is ungrateful to me

1169
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,389
Chi Yeuk, what happened at
Summit Guang Ming

1170
01:11:01,490 --> 01:11:02,787
was all my fault

1171
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:04,586
I hope that you can give me a chance

1172
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:06,058
to go and save my godfather

1173
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:09,324
I have sworn in front of

1174
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:10,989
all heroes at the Summit Guang Ming

1175
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:14,160
that I no longer have anything
to do with you

1176
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:28,408
Chi Yeuk, your kung fu is so powerful

1177
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:29,245
where did you learn it from?

1178
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:30,818
You absorb my Jiu Yang kung fu

1179
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:32,416
None of your business

1180
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:34,620
I now remember...

1181
01:11:34,723 --> 01:11:36,213
you were the one in black

1182
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:37,121
in the wood house

1183
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:38,250
Why did you want to kill me and Miss Chiu?

1184
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:44,492
Are you responsible for
the Ice Fire Island incident?

1185
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,328
Shut up

1186
01:11:48,203 --> 01:11:49,067
Speak, was it you?

1187
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:49,933
No

1188
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:54,470
If it wasn't you, who could it be?

1189
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:01,809
Freeze

1190
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:09,190
Chief Chang, don't let your mind
wander again

1191
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:11,350
in any combat

1192
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,266
Who is it?

1193
01:12:27,276 --> 01:12:29,904
Chang Wu Ji... here to visit
Er Mei Clan's head

1194
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:30,774
Please wait

1195
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,246
Chief Chang, please come in

1196
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:44,957
Leader Chou

1197
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:49,019
Chief Chang, what's the matter?

1198
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:51,497
How is Hero Sung's injury?

1199
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,161
It can't be minor,
considering he lost to you

1200
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:57,101
I've brought the medicine

1201
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:59,140
which can cure his injury

1202
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:02,608
Really?

1203
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:07,741
Maybe you will feel better
if you can cure him

1204
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,750
and be a husband of Yuan princess
without any guilt

1205
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:12,582
No, that's not it

1206
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:16,686
In fact, I saved Hero Sung's life

1207
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:18,555
in exchange for

1208
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:21,857
my godfather's

1209
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:24,356
And it's not easy...

1210
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:25,763
to save godfather tomorrow

1211
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:27,893
Over at 3 Pine Peak,

1212
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:29,163
my godfather was guarded by

1213
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:30,966
the 3 Shaolin monks of high renown

1214
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,165
You and I mustjoin hands

1215
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:33,468
to fight and beat them

1216
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:35,702
Otherwise my godfather cannot be saved

1217
01:13:37,846 --> 01:13:40,041
Why do you have to save him?

1218
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:44,778
Firstly, godfather has been good to me

1219
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:46,081
Secondly, I want to find out

1220
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:48,782
what really happened
at the Ice Fire Island

1221
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:56,095
I've come here to plead with you

1222
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:03,996
Wu Ji, the night of the wedding
at Guang Ming Summit

1223
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:05,573
I spoke in front of all the people

1224
01:14:05,674 --> 01:14:08,074
that you and I have nothing to do
with each other

1225
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:10,702
Therefore I don't understand

1226
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:12,804
what you are saying now at all

1227
01:14:12,915 --> 01:14:13,847
Come, send him off

1228
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:15,945
Chi Yeuk

1229
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:17,211
Chief Chang, please

1230
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:22,955
Wait

1231
01:14:25,093 --> 01:14:27,152
I've almost forgot to tell you

1232
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:29,287
If you help me tomorrow...

1233
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:30,990
you will regret for your life

1234
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:58,782
At the last combat at 3 Pine Peak,
Er Mei has won

1235
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:00,691
According to the rules

1236
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:04,596
Leader Chou can have Tse Shun

1237
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:10,070
However to maintain peace,
a special rule applies

1238
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:14,074
As long as the challenger can
lure the monks

1239
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:18,010
...out of the tree hole
and gets to sit inside;

1240
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:20,479
He wins

1241
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:25,281
In case he can't accomplish that
before sunset

1242
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:29,118
...Tse Shun will still be Shaolin's

1243
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:30,782
Leader Chou, please

1244
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:36,521
Chi Yeuk, these monks are kung fu expert

1245
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:37,963
You'd better be careful

1246
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:38,794
None of your business

1247
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:42,060
Sirs, excuse me

1248
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:45,862
I am about to launch the attack

1249
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,794
Although Leader Chou won all
other martial artists

1250
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:10,592
three against one is disrespectful
to Shaolin

1251
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:12,894
That's why I would like to join in

1252
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:14,764
That seems to be fairer

1253
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,895
What do you think?

1254
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:20,532
Only winning counts,
not the number of people

1255
01:16:20,642 --> 01:16:23,042
Chang Wu Ji, I've told you

1256
01:16:23,145 --> 01:16:25,443
if you help me, you'll regret for
the rest of your life

1257
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:59,013
Shaolin monk is really good

1258
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:06,076
You again

1259
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:09,214
Yes, it doesn't seem fair for
3 to fight against 2

1260
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:11,815
3 against 3 seems fairer

1261
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:14,487
And then each tree hole
has someone sitting in it

1262
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,440
Dragon 18 Fist, the Beggar Clan's
ultimate kung fu

1263
01:18:27,869 --> 01:18:30,030
Amitabha...

1264
01:18:37,612 --> 01:18:38,203
How come you are here too?

1265
01:18:38,313 --> 01:18:41,339
I've brought the Heaven Sword
and the Dragon Sabre

1266
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:43,577
The Heaven Sword and the Dragon Sabre

1267
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:48,247
It's said that together
they are invincible

1268
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:49,618
I must try

1269
01:18:59,034 --> 01:19:00,865
Sister Chou, don't be hasty

1270
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:03,267
Let's talk about our matters later

1271
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:25,613
Bravo...

1272
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,017
Good...

1273
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:29,716
They really are the most powerful
weapons in the world

1274
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,349
I'm convinced

1275
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:40,395
Who is it?

1276
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:45,001
Amitabha

1277
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:50,174
Godfather... I've finally saved you

1278
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:51,540
I've saved you at last

1279
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:56,311
The past months I've listened to
prayers under the rock

1280
01:20:56,418 --> 01:20:59,751
Thank you to the 3 monks
in showing me the right way

1281
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:02,415
I feel that I have sinned greatly

1282
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:06,517
I intend not to be involved in
secular matters again

1283
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:09,756
However in order to clear all grudge

1284
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:14,029
and put an end to
what a sinful affair started

1285
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:16,603
I've decided to show up again

1286
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:20,569
Masters, can I use this holy place

1287
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:22,199
to settle some secular business?

1288
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:25,238
Well, since it's that as you say

1289
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:29,511
...why bother to ask us?

1290
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:30,607
Thank you, Master

1291
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:41,586
Monk Yuen Chun, you are my teacher
Shing Kwun

1292
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:42,594
Please come out

1293
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:47,725
What?

1294
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:52,899
Shing Kwun, we are responsible for

1295
01:21:53,008 --> 01:21:55,238
all the grudges in the martial arts world

1296
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:57,641
You raped and killed my wife to avenge...

1297
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,646
for the Ming Cult leader who took
your loved one

1298
01:21:59,748 --> 01:22:02,740
You tried to urge all schools
in the central region

1299
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:04,284
...to destroy the Ming Cult, am I right?

1300
01:22:04,386 --> 01:22:06,320
Yes

1301
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:11,282
Last time you caught me

1302
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:13,418
and put me in 3 Pine Peak

1303
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:16,463
Now I understand

1304
01:22:16,564 --> 01:22:18,361
At the Summit Guang Ming

1305
01:22:18,466 --> 01:22:21,458
the 6 clans were unable to destroy
the Ming Cult

1306
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:23,662
That was why you wanted to
make use of the 3 monks

1307
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:25,603
...to kill Wu Ji first

1308
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:28,073
By that time all men from
the Ming Cult will fight

1309
01:22:28,176 --> 01:22:30,701
and you can kill with other people's hands

1310
01:22:30,812 --> 01:22:31,574
Is that correct?

1311
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:36,114
It seems that you've figured out

1312
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:38,742
what I want to do

1313
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:41,250
That's right

1314
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:43,085
I've had only one wish my entire life

1315
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:45,557
And that is to destroy the Ming Cult

1316
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:47,928
Destroy the Ming Cult...

1317
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:50,122
Good, now the grudge between the Ming cult

1318
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:52,426
and other schools is resolved

1319
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:55,469
and everyone is clear about this

1320
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:56,867
What's left behind...

1321
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,702
is the grudge between me and Shing Kwun

1322
01:23:39,714 --> 01:23:43,548
Uncle...

1323
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:46,882
Shing Kwun, you killed my whole family

1324
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:48,455
I should kill you

1325
01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:50,581
But by the mercy of Buddha

1326
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:52,319
I'll just take out your eyes

1327
01:23:52,427 --> 01:23:55,590
and we have no more grudge against
each other

1328
01:23:55,697 --> 01:23:57,665
You can never see me

1329
01:23:57,766 --> 01:23:59,927
I won't see you either

1330
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:03,332
Amitabha, take him down

1331
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,612
Shing Kwun owes me but,

1332
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:16,081
I owe hundreds & thousands
in the martial arts world

1333
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:20,382
I'm willing to be maimed
and slaughtered in any way

1334
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:23,924
by those whose families have been
killed by me

1335
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:26,653
Godfather...

1336
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:30,527
Wu Ji, if someone wants to kill me

1337
01:24:30,632 --> 01:24:34,500
don't stop them, I deserve it

1338
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:38,402
I deserve death, go away

1339
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:47,211
Good...

1340
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:52,611
My father was killed by Tse Shun

1341
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:56,656
I was supposed to kill him,
but I'm impressed by

1342
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:58,555
his honour and gallantry

1343
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:00,855
Besides, when Tse Shun
started killing, he was...

1344
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:04,796
driven mad by Shing Kwun
who raped and killed his wife

1345
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:06,696
Let's forgive him

1346
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:17,605
Thank you, heroes

1347
01:25:19,347 --> 01:25:24,250
All is emptiness

1348
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:28,982
why bother with tears?

1349
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:44,765
I'm deeply in sin, please let me stay

1350
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:46,431
...to become a monk

1351
01:25:46,541 --> 01:25:50,409
Amitabha, the doors of Buddha are
always open to you

1352
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:53,845
Come in if you are called for, let's go

1353
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:01,983
Godfather...

1354
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:05,988
Sir, you've got the wrong person

1355
01:26:06,094 --> 01:26:08,153
Tse Shun is dead

1356
01:26:08,263 --> 01:26:10,891
I'm the monk who has just been converted

1357
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:12,296
Amitabha

1358
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:17,395
Old grudge has now been resolved

1359
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:19,996
All is emptiness

1360
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:21,338
Don't go, godfather

1361
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:22,204
What are you doing?

1362
01:26:22,644 --> 01:26:24,669
I want to ask him about
the Ice Fire Island incident

1363
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:27,504
Why do you have to ask him and not me?

1364
01:26:27,615 --> 01:26:29,173
You?

1365
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:30,644
Who are you?

1366
01:26:33,454 --> 01:26:34,478
Cousin Yan Li

1367
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:39,390
Chou Chi Yeuk, now it's the time
for you to talk

1368
01:26:39,494 --> 01:26:40,518
Let me relieve your pressure points

1369
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:46,993
Don't

1370
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:48,834
Don't

1371
01:26:49,938 --> 01:26:52,133
Chi Yeuk, why do you have to kill her?

1372
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:54,208
Of course she wants to kill me because...

1373
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:56,334
I know she stole the Heaven Sword
and the Dragon Sabre

1374
01:26:56,444 --> 01:26:58,275
Bullshit. These two weapons are...

1375
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,108
brought here by Chiu Ming

1376
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:01,705
Why are you accusing me of their theft?

1377
01:27:01,816 --> 01:27:02,908
That's right

1378
01:27:03,017 --> 01:27:06,248
I took the Heaven Sword
and the Dragon Sabre

1379
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:08,549
but the hilts of the Heaven Sword

1380
01:27:08,656 --> 01:27:10,317
and the Dragon Sabre

1381
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:12,586
have been cut open

1382
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:22,670
I think you must be curious as to where...

1383
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:24,362
I got this Sword and the Sabre from!

1384
01:27:25,473 --> 01:27:26,440
Come

1385
01:27:28,209 --> 01:27:31,110
Sung Ching Shu...

1386
01:27:31,212 --> 01:27:32,372
Ching Shu, I'll kill you

1387
01:27:34,616 --> 01:27:35,583
I've got the Sword and the Sabre

1388
01:27:35,683 --> 01:27:38,174
...from your fiance

1389
01:27:38,286 --> 01:27:40,379
But you've already taken the manual
stored within them

1390
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:45,087
Chi Yeuk

1391
01:27:48,062 --> 01:27:48,892
Don't fight

1392
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:51,692
Chiu Ming, don't fight

1393
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:54,259
Chiu Ming, what's going on?

1394
01:27:54,369 --> 01:27:55,700
Let's start from the night
at the Ice Fire Island

1395
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:57,361
...when Siu Chiu went away

1396
01:27:58,339 --> 01:27:59,931
Chou Chi Yeuk put poison

1397
01:28:00,041 --> 01:28:02,271
in the water when we were all unaware

1398
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:05,312
And we all passed out that night

1399
01:28:05,413 --> 01:28:08,849
Then she put me on the boat and
pushed it out to sea

1400
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:11,680
After that she wounded herself
and killed Yan Li

1401
01:28:12,654 --> 01:28:13,416
Nonsense

1402
01:28:13,521 --> 01:28:14,579
No, she's right

1403
01:28:15,323 --> 01:28:17,450
That day you must be too nervous

1404
01:28:17,558 --> 01:28:19,651
You didn't kill me

1405
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:22,229
And my cousin put me on the boat

1406
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:24,298
...and that saved my life

1407
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:26,390
On the island on the other side
of the sea,

1408
01:28:26,501 --> 01:28:28,992
I met the Beggar Clan's
recluse old leader. He not only

1409
01:28:29,103 --> 01:28:32,595
saved me but also taught me the
Dragon 18 fist kung fu

1410
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:36,040
I am now the new leader of the Beggar Clan

1411
01:28:48,289 --> 01:28:51,122
Chi Yeuk, is she telling the truth?

1412
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:54,850
Yes

1413
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:59,157
I don't want to lie to you anymore

1414
01:28:59,267 --> 01:29:00,962
I can't fool you anymore

1415
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:03,803
That day at Man Fat Temple

1416
01:29:03,905 --> 01:29:05,668
Teacher told me that

1417
01:29:05,773 --> 01:29:08,765
the secret of the Heaven Sword
and the Dragon Sabre

1418
01:29:08,876 --> 01:29:11,538
is the Jiu Yin and the
Dragon 18 fist kung fu

1419
01:29:11,646 --> 01:29:14,706
which are both hidden in their
respective hilts

1420
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:17,483
You can easily get the...

1421
01:29:17,585 --> 01:29:20,076
Dragon Sabre from Wu Ji

1422
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:23,248
That's why I made you my successor

1423
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:27,658
But you have to promise me that...

1424
01:29:27,762 --> 01:29:29,525
you have to make Er Mei

1425
01:29:29,630 --> 01:29:33,031
conquer the whole central region
by whatever means

1426
01:29:33,801 --> 01:29:35,996
I have to follow the instructions
of my late teacher

1427
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:38,402
Hence, come what may I have to...

1428
01:29:38,506 --> 01:29:41,475
get hold of the Heaven Sword
and the Dragon Sabre

1429
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:45,244
In the hilts of Heaven Sword
& Dragon Sabre

1430
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:48,008
is really hidden half book
of Jiu Yin kung fu

1431
01:29:48,116 --> 01:29:50,016
and Dragon 18 fist kung fu

1432
01:29:50,351 --> 01:29:53,115
Is it why your kung fu
has progressed so fast lately?

1433
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:55,451
Did you betray Tse Shun?

1434
01:29:55,723 --> 01:29:59,716
Yes, I was afraid Tse Shun
would let out the secret

1435
01:29:59,827 --> 01:30:01,294
Therefore I went to Sung Ching Shu...

1436
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,864
and made use of Yuan to kidnap Tse Shun

1437
01:30:03,965 --> 01:30:06,627
I was hoping to use Shing Kwun
to kill Tse Shun

1438
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:10,465
Unexpectedly, Shing Kwun intended...

1439
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:14,803
to use Tse Shun to destroy the Ming Cult

1440
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:18,242
and I had been victimized until this day

1441
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:19,278
Don't move

1442
01:30:21,582 --> 01:30:24,142
Chou Chi Yeuk, what do you want?

1443
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:27,346
I want Chang Wu Ji to do one thing for me

1444
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:28,285
What is it?

1445
01:30:28,389 --> 01:30:32,348
I repent for all my wrongdoings

1446
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:36,760
I want to shave my head and be a nun

1447
01:30:36,864 --> 01:30:41,597
But I hope that you will be the one

1448
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:43,067
...to shave my head

1449
01:31:37,225 --> 01:31:40,888
Glory to Amitabha

1450
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:47,692
Glory to Amitabha

1451
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:52,464
Because ofjealousy towards Chiu Ming...

1452
01:31:52,573 --> 01:31:56,009
Chou Chi Yeuk had made a grave mistake

1453
01:31:56,110 --> 01:32:00,240
Since then, the leader of a clan
becomes a Buddhist nun

1454
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:04,648
...for the rest of her life

1455
01:32:04,752 --> 01:32:06,652
The story of the Heaven Sword
and the Dragon Sabre

1456
01:32:06,754 --> 01:32:09,279
...is now coming to an end

1457
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:11,119
What now remains is...

1458
01:32:11,225 --> 01:32:14,126
a short episode of Chiu Ming
and Chang Wu Ji

1459
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:16,788
Wu Ji has promised

1460
01:32:16,898 --> 01:32:19,264
Chiu Ming to do 3 things for her

1461
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:21,767
And the last thing Chiu Ming requested

1462
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:24,360
...was to have Wu Ji go with her

1463
01:32:48,829 --> 01:32:51,764
What is this place?

1464
01:32:51,866 --> 01:32:54,767
It's a place for bidding farewell

1465
01:32:54,869 --> 01:32:56,097
What?

1466
01:32:57,538 --> 01:33:01,474
The Willow's Shore isn't necessarily
a place for adieu

1467
01:33:01,576 --> 01:33:03,737
...neither is it the Pavilion;

1468
01:33:04,612 --> 01:33:08,070
It's the time where bidding farewell
is most proper

1469
01:33:08,449 --> 01:33:10,178
Didn't you say that your third request

1470
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:11,717
...is for me to go with you?

1471
01:33:11,819 --> 01:33:12,649
That's correct

1472
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:16,484
This is IT then

1473
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:22,092
The ultimate aim of you people
from the Central Region

1474
01:33:22,196 --> 01:33:23,993
...is to fight against us,
the Yuan regime

1475
01:33:24,532 --> 01:33:27,797
And I am the princess of Yuan;

1476
01:33:27,902 --> 01:33:30,632
How long can we stay together?

1477
01:33:37,144 --> 01:33:39,112
Everyone's destiny

1478
01:33:39,213 --> 01:33:42,614
has been arranged at birth

1479
01:33:44,685 --> 01:33:47,848
And this is called fate

1480
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:55,390
We are on 2 separate roads

1481
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:15,843
Fortunately, I've never said I love you

1482
01:34:16,917 --> 01:34:18,885
...neither have you

1483
01:34:34,635 --> 01:34:41,973
Love is like a net,
capturing heroes' hearts

1484
01:34:42,076 --> 01:34:49,983
Like a sword, vengeance cutting
through love and hate

1485
01:34:50,084 --> 01:34:57,616
Even heroes have to succumb

1486
01:34:57,725 --> 01:35:04,324
...to love and hate

1487
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:12,132
Not even the Heaven Sword
and Dragon Sabre

1488
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:16,005
can disentangle love and hate

1489
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:21,548
Hatred in the sea of love

1490
01:35:21,649 --> 01:35:24,083
Regrets in this life

1491
01:35:24,185 --> 01:35:29,054
filled with resentment and love

1492
01:35:29,156 --> 01:35:35,356
Who can answer what is love and hate!
