00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,570
White Fang (1991)

3
00:03:57,547 --> 00:04:00,584
Give it some slack.

4
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:06,701
Careful, boy.
You could be his breakfast.

5
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:13,424
- Hey, don't do that.
- Why not? He's mine.

6
00:04:16,147 --> 00:04:18,342
Shipped him all the way
from San Francisco.

7
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:21,021
He was a family dog.
I'm gonna teach him to fight.

8
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:25,305
Good fightin' dog
can make a lot of money up here.
Hey, you up here for the gold?

9
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:28,584
- You got that right.
- Well, it's out there just waiting
for somebody to pick it up.

10
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,465
These are friends of mine.
This here's Luke, Tinker.

11
00:04:31,547 --> 00:04:33,617
Didn't get your name.

12
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:36,016
- Jack.
- Jack.

13
00:04:37,307 --> 00:04:40,583
What's your hurry?

14
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:42,942
You guys ever heard of a man
named Alex Larson?

15
00:04:43,027 --> 00:04:46,986
- Alex Larson? Why, he's my old pal!
- Practically brothers.

16
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:50,298
- Why, Beauty here's saved Alex's life
more than once. Ain't you, Beauty?
- He'd do the same for me.

17
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:53,902
Back off, man.

18
00:04:53,987 --> 00:04:57,582
- You fellas don't really know
Alex Larson, do ya?
- What did I tell ya?

19
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:02,024
You can't fool these city boys. Nah, we
don't know him, but we could find him.

20
00:05:02,107 --> 00:05:04,780
If he's a gold man...
and who ain't up here...

21
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:07,745
he'd be on his way
up the golden staircase.

22
00:05:07,827 --> 00:05:11,103
- Golden staircase?
- Yeah.
- Chilkoot Pass.

23
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:13,576
About two or three miles
outside of town.

24
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:16,101
- You'll need some help
hauling your gear to the top, though.
- Hey, I said back off.

25
00:05:16,187 --> 00:05:20,100
Hey, easy. Sorry.
We don't mean to crowd you, boy.

26
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:24,779
- Good luck to you, Jack.
- See you later.

27
00:05:29,387 --> 00:05:33,699
Hyah! Hyah! Get along now! Hyah!

28
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:36,096
Hey! Hey!

29
00:05:41,627 --> 00:05:43,857
Hey!

30
00:05:45,147 --> 00:05:48,184
- I've been robbed.
- Welcome to the Yukon.

31
00:05:51,147 --> 00:05:54,105
- How high is that golden staircase?
- About a mile.

32
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,657
- But it'll seem like more.
- Yeah, well, I can make it up that far.

33
00:06:16,147 --> 00:06:20,026
Hey, I'll sell you a map of a place
where there's plenty of gold.

34
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,656
Keep moving, you men!

35
00:06:29,107 --> 00:06:31,177
That's it. Keep goin'.

36
00:06:57,227 --> 00:06:59,582
Go on! Keep going!

37
00:07:01,347 --> 00:07:03,656
Kid, move it!

38
00:07:56,867 --> 00:08:00,746
Hey, do you know
where I can find Alex Larson?

39
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:04,024
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Over there.

40
00:08:12,707 --> 00:08:15,380
- Are you Alex Larson?
- Depends who's asking.

41
00:08:16,627 --> 00:08:19,346
I sent you a letter.

42
00:08:20,707 --> 00:08:24,541
Anybody who knows me knows I can't read,
so they don't write.

43
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:28,859
Anybody who writes me,
I figure I don't know him.

44
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:32,144
Well, I'm Jack,
Scott Conroy's son.

45
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:38,179
I'm looking for somebody
who can take me to my father's claim.

46
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:42,901
- Who's in there?
- Name's Dutch.

47
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:49,584
My father sent me his maps
before he died.

48
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,976
And he sent something else.

49
00:08:53,347 --> 00:08:56,737
He sent me gold.
There was gold dust in the envelope.

50
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,739
If you take me out to his claim,
I'll cut you in.

51
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:04,019
- What's so funny?
- Everybody finds a little gold dust.

52
00:09:04,107 --> 00:09:06,621
That's what keeps you digging.

53
00:09:06,707 --> 00:09:09,016
But you have to strike it.

54
00:09:10,307 --> 00:09:12,263
And your father didn't.

55
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,899
Go home and find a regular job.

56
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:20,263
You wouldn't last a day out here.

57
00:09:20,347 --> 00:09:23,464
I'm a good worker,
and I just want what's mine.
I'm asking you to give me a chance.

58
00:09:23,547 --> 00:09:25,742
- Skunker.
- Damn! What is it?

59
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,743
Alex, I was dreaming you, me and Dutch
was living it up in Frisco.

60
00:09:32,827 --> 00:09:35,022
Get the dogs ready.

61
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,302
I hope Dutch appreciates this ride.

62
00:09:37,387 --> 00:09:41,699
'Cause you should've died at your digs
and saved us a trip back.

63
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:44,745
- Are you going near my father's claim?
- Scott Conroy's boy.

64
00:09:44,827 --> 00:09:47,102
What?

65
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:50,224
Let me see that face, kid.
Come here.

66
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:55,779
My God, Alex, he's the spittin' image
of his old man. And I knew your pa well.

67
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:57,778
- Clarence Thurston.
- Jack Conroy.

68
00:09:57,867 --> 00:09:59,744
- You throwin' in with us?
- Yeah, I'd like to.

69
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:03,263
- No.
- No?
- No?

70
00:10:03,347 --> 00:10:06,544
What, you're taking him with you
and you're not gonna take me?
He looks half dead already.

71
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:09,824
- Hey!
- I'm s... No offence.

72
00:10:09,907 --> 00:10:13,263
Give me a stick of that gum
and I'll forgive you.

73
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:16,657
It's hard to get it up here,
and it makes my breath smell real fresh.

74
00:10:16,747 --> 00:10:19,056
- Yeah.
- Hey, don't worry about him.

75
00:10:19,147 --> 00:10:20,944
- He's just tired, that's all.
- Yeah?

76
00:10:21,027 --> 00:10:23,587
Yeah, or he knows there's gold there
and he wants it for himself.

77
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:26,818
Whoa, boy. You got the harness
on the wrong dog.

78
00:10:26,907 --> 00:10:29,979
Listen, if you don't want to take me,
then I'll go by myself.

79
00:10:30,067 --> 00:10:32,262
I'll get rich by myself too.

80
00:10:32,347 --> 00:10:34,417
I think he's crazy enough
to do it, Alex.

81
00:10:34,507 --> 00:10:37,704
And you know he doesn't stand a chance.

82
00:10:37,787 --> 00:10:41,666
Come on, Alex, he's Scott's boy.
Look at him, huh?

83
00:10:41,747 --> 00:10:44,056
How much trouble could he be?

84
00:10:45,827 --> 00:10:49,502
All right.
I'll take you as far as Klondike.

85
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:52,659
Fall behind,
and I'll leave you where you drop.

86
00:10:52,747 --> 00:10:54,817
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

87
00:10:54,907 --> 00:10:57,944
- I'm going to regret this.
- Nah, Alex.

88
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:36,536
Pull, Digger! Come on, boy!
Attaboy, Digger! Pull!

89
00:11:40,627 --> 00:11:43,221
Mush! Mush! Come on, boys!

90
00:11:43,307 --> 00:11:45,775
Come on, boys! Pull, boys!

91
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:14,576
Whoa! Alex.

92
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:18,502
I got a loose harness on Blue.

93
00:12:26,947 --> 00:12:30,383
Okay, mush! Come on, Fritz!

94
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:33,140
Attaboy! Mush!

95
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:21,981
Pull, Digger! Come on, boy!

96
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,376
Attaboy, Digger! Pull!

97
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:28,137
Mush! Mush! Come on, boys!

98
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:39,021
Whoa!

99
00:13:39,107 --> 00:13:42,258
- Are you all right, kid?
- I saw something.

100
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:45,464
In the woods.

101
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:48,186
Wolves. They've been trailing us
for a couple of hours now.

102
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:51,339
Game's scarce.
They must be starving.

103
00:13:51,427 --> 00:13:54,146
- Think they're after us?
- The dogs.

104
00:13:54,227 --> 00:13:58,539
Wolves won't jump a man,
unless hunger's got them totally crazed.

105
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:06,742
- Let's get going.
- Wolves be the devil on earth.

106
00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:11,105
Kid, give me a piece of that gum again,
will ya? It calms me.

107
00:14:11,187 --> 00:14:13,417
I'll carry it for ya, okay?

108
00:14:14,707 --> 00:14:17,301
- Come on!
- Mush, Digger!

109
00:14:17,387 --> 00:14:20,265
Mush! Come on, boys! Pull!

110
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:22,383
Mush! Let's go!

111
00:14:24,627 --> 00:14:29,178
All right. Mush. Come on, pull, Fatty.
Quit playin' around.

112
00:14:36,027 --> 00:14:38,666
Got that tarp a little close
to the fire, don't you?

113
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:41,056
Well, I don't want to freeze to death.

114
00:14:46,227 --> 00:14:49,139
- What's he doing?
- Cleaning his teeth.

115
00:14:50,547 --> 00:14:52,856
How'd they get dirty?

116
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:59,786
Oh, Jeez!

117
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:06,065
Watch it!

118
00:15:07,147 --> 00:15:10,423
Whoops.

119
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:14,898
Yeah, I know it's a little fishy, but
you can put your head at the other end.

120
00:15:14,987 --> 00:15:17,182
Told you.
Too close to the fire.

121
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:31,776
Nice weather.

122
00:15:43,587 --> 00:15:47,546
- What are you doing?
- The only things my dogs drag
are things we need.

123
00:15:49,587 --> 00:15:51,418
That's my property.

124
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:53,384
You want 'em?

125
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:56,901
- You carry 'em.
- Hold it, hold it, hold it.

126
00:15:56,987 --> 00:16:01,538
I'm gonna feed the dogs, fellas.
You're not gonna kill each other
while I'm gone, are ya?

127
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:05,142
We'll wait till you come back.

128
00:16:05,227 --> 00:16:09,300
Oh, boy. Here comes the fishies.
They smell good too.

129
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:13,175
You guys know who loves you, don't you?
Here you go. Here's one for you.

130
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:17,306
And here's some fish for you, Fatty.
Oh! Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

131
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:25,184
Seven pieces of fish for seven dogs,
and you didn't get any.

132
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:28,703
- What are you mumbling about?
- Seven fish for seven dogs.

133
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:32,223
And Digger didn't get fed. I swear
there was a wolf in with the dogs.

134
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:35,663
- And I fed the damn thing.
- Well, how would a wolf
get in with the dogs?

135
00:16:35,747 --> 00:16:38,580
He's dreaming again.

136
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:09,298
Relax.

137
00:17:09,387 --> 00:17:13,266
The fire's going.
They will keep their distance.

138
00:17:15,627 --> 00:17:19,939
Alex, I ever tell you my uncle
was a wolfer down in Montana?

139
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:24,942
When I was little, he used to
lower me in the hole and have me
shoot the cub puppies for the bounty.

140
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:27,825
I hated doing that.

141
00:17:27,907 --> 00:17:30,216
Get some sleep, Skunker.

142
00:17:48,227 --> 00:17:50,661
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

143
00:17:50,747 --> 00:17:53,500
- We gonna go around?
- Yeah, the dogs can handle that.

144
00:17:53,587 --> 00:17:56,897
Just go slowly and stay to the left.

145
00:17:56,987 --> 00:17:59,785
Help me balance this.
Come on.

146
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:02,256
Let's keep it nice and slow.

147
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,578
Oh. Oh! Easy! Oh!

148
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,385
Oh!

149
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:12,261
- My-My books!
- Damn it, kid, forget the books!

150
00:18:12,347 --> 00:18:15,419
Look out!

151
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:21,057
Hang on, kid. I got ya!
Hold on there. Now stand up.

152
00:18:21,147 --> 00:18:24,856
Dig your feet in. Just stand up.
Get your feet up. Come on.

153
00:18:26,787 --> 00:18:29,699
I gotta get the rope untangled.

154
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:37,778
- Stay!
- All right, come on, Jack. You can
do it, kid. Come on, reach up there.

155
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:44,339
Get clear!
Get clear of the sled, Jack!

156
00:19:27,347 --> 00:19:30,942
Jack, stay right there!
Don't move on that ice!

157
00:19:31,027 --> 00:19:34,383
Don't move! Jack!

158
00:19:37,907 --> 00:19:40,216
I'll get the ammo.

159
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,941
Jack! Come back!

160
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:58,025
Jack! Don't move!

161
00:20:17,787 --> 00:20:20,347
Hurry up! Help me!

162
00:20:21,867 --> 00:20:24,665
I told you not to move!

163
00:20:25,947 --> 00:20:27,983
Help!

164
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:33,580
- Hold on! Hold on!
- Help me!

165
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:36,227
- All right.
- Take this rope!
- Come on, kid.

166
00:20:36,307 --> 00:20:39,777
Attaboy.

167
00:20:52,787 --> 00:20:57,099
Jack, get these clothes off!
That's it! Keep moving!

168
00:20:57,187 --> 00:20:59,303
Take it easy.

169
00:21:00,787 --> 00:21:04,496
Attaboy. You get this off, and I'll
get the blanket. He's turning blue.

170
00:21:08,147 --> 00:21:10,217
Take it easy.

171
00:21:10,307 --> 00:21:12,946
We'll get you warm soon enough.

172
00:21:13,027 --> 00:21:17,976
Get a fire going
before he freezes to death. Hurry up!

173
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:20,581
Come on, take your shirt off.
Help me!

174
00:21:25,907 --> 00:21:31,379
- It's gonna be too wet.
- Come on. Keep moving. That's it.

175
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:34,379
Books. There we go.

176
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:40,426
Keep moving!
That's it. That's it. Come on.

177
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:45,576
- Now we're cookin'. That's it.
- Come here!
- Come on, get him over here, Alex!

178
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:48,818
Here. Sit down there, boy.

179
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:51,626
- Put your hands under your arms.
- Keep your fingers moving.

180
00:21:51,707 --> 00:21:55,256
Now, let's get the rest
of these wet clothes off.

181
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,656
That's startin' to feel good, huh?

182
00:22:00,107 --> 00:22:05,579
- I'm sorry, Alex. L... I was trying
to get the ammo, and l... I thought...
- Stop talking and drink this.

183
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:10,616
Drink it. It's pine-needle tea.
It tastes like hell,
but, uh, it keeps the heart pumping.

184
00:22:16,427 --> 00:22:19,066
I'll get Dutch.

185
00:22:32,947 --> 00:22:36,064
- What's left?
- Three cartridges.

186
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:39,457
Damn. It's like
being naked out here.

187
00:22:41,547 --> 00:22:45,222
"He's Scott's boy.
How much trouble could he be?"

188
00:22:54,387 --> 00:22:55,900
We've got company.

189
00:22:58,027 --> 00:23:01,019
Shield the firelight from your eye.
Look hard.

190
00:23:03,027 --> 00:23:07,100
Let's get the dogs safe.
George. Digger.

191
00:23:07,187 --> 00:23:10,304
- Got Fritz and Fatty. Move it.
- Settle down. Settle down.

192
00:23:10,387 --> 00:23:14,062
Get down in there.
Get down in there.

193
00:23:14,147 --> 00:23:17,901
Look.

194
00:23:17,987 --> 00:23:21,946
It's a female, Alex.
That bitch is part dog.

195
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:25,258
- That's why she's afraid of the fire.
- She's a decoy.

196
00:23:25,347 --> 00:23:28,225
She draws the dogs out
so the pack can eat them.

197
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:31,219
Digger, come back here! Digger!

198
00:23:31,307 --> 00:23:35,459
- Digger! Damn! Come back!
- Damn you, Digger, come back
or I'm gon' whup you!

199
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:39,426
Digger, come back here!
Digger!

200
00:23:39,507 --> 00:23:41,782
Digger, come here!

201
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:44,142
Damn you, don't be fooled!
Get over here!

202
00:23:46,227 --> 00:23:49,139
- Digger, come back!
- Digger! Digger!

203
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,422
- I know where one
of these bullets is going.
- Hey!
- Are you crazy?

204
00:23:51,507 --> 00:23:55,216
- He's my best dog!
- Skunker! Skunker, come back!

205
00:23:55,307 --> 00:23:58,299
- Digger, get out of the way!
- Don't waste the bullet!

206
00:24:06,707 --> 00:24:08,857
My God. Digger!

207
00:24:13,427 --> 00:24:16,100
- Digger, come back!
- Skunker!
- Stay put! Skunker!

208
00:24:16,187 --> 00:24:19,179
- Digger!
- They're right behind you!

209
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:21,986
- Come back here!
- Skunker!

210
00:24:42,267 --> 00:24:45,225
He's gone.
There's nothing we can do.

211
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:05,825
Sorry, Skunker.

212
00:25:05,907 --> 00:25:08,819
I didn't have a chance
to say goodbye.

213
00:25:14,107 --> 00:25:16,416
Go to sleep.

214
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,577
Help me. Come on.

215
00:26:31,747 --> 00:26:34,056
Let's pack up.

216
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:20,538
- Hey! You all right?
- Yes!

217
00:27:20,627 --> 00:27:24,302
- But how did you find us?
- Saw the smoke from your fire.

218
00:27:24,387 --> 00:27:27,902
Thank God.
You saved our lives.

219
00:33:11,547 --> 00:33:14,584
What chance would a wolf cub have
of surviving on his own out here?

220
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,862
None without the pack.

221
00:35:46,747 --> 00:35:49,056
Come on. Come on.

222
00:35:57,267 --> 00:35:59,622
Whoa.

223
00:36:01,747 --> 00:36:05,660
Is there any good reason
why we can't just bury him here?

224
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:09,057
L... I don't think
he'll know the difference.

225
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:11,456
I gave him my word.

226
00:36:13,267 --> 00:36:15,576
Okay! Okay!

227
00:37:10,707 --> 00:37:12,937
Look. The white fang.

228
00:37:13,027 --> 00:37:15,336
This wolf is part dog.

229
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:03,296
You know, I'm glad Dutch is dead
'cause I'm ready to kill him.

230
00:38:03,387 --> 00:38:05,059
Whoa! Whoa!

231
00:38:15,507 --> 00:38:18,544
Look, you old weasel!

232
00:38:18,627 --> 00:38:23,940
Look at that! You're home!
You're home now! Home!

233
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:28,416
Okay, okay! Come on!

234
00:38:36,867 --> 00:38:39,017
Let's move out.

235
00:38:39,107 --> 00:38:41,337
Klondike is still
a good two days away.

236
00:38:45,947 --> 00:38:48,256
You gonna say anything?

237
00:38:54,787 --> 00:38:57,460
- You know what?
- What?

238
00:38:59,427 --> 00:39:01,543
I never really liked the bastard.

239
00:39:10,827 --> 00:39:14,581
Come, come. Come here.
Over here. Good. Good.

240
00:39:14,667 --> 00:39:16,862
Bring it. Over here.

241
00:39:25,227 --> 00:39:27,980
Looks like he's gonna be
a good working dog.

242
00:39:33,267 --> 00:39:36,464
- Hey, Ned!
- Over here! Come on!

243
00:39:43,227 --> 00:39:45,866
- Come on.
- Okay, Harry.

244
00:39:45,947 --> 00:39:47,505
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi, Alex.

245
00:39:47,587 --> 00:39:50,499
- Take good care of them. Okay?
- Sure will.

246
00:39:53,707 --> 00:39:56,096
What are you going to do
for money?

247
00:39:56,187 --> 00:39:58,906
Well, l...
I got 50 bucks in my boot.

248
00:40:00,787 --> 00:40:05,656
You'll be all right. You can get a dry
bed at Bradford's at the edge of town.

249
00:40:05,747 --> 00:40:09,057
Tell Dave I sent you.
He'll give you a good rate.

250
00:40:09,147 --> 00:40:13,220
Okay. Uh, where, uh,
where are you going?

251
00:40:13,307 --> 00:40:15,775
- To see a friend.
- Okay.

252
00:40:15,867 --> 00:40:20,258
- Listen, get yourself a partner.
- Yeah, sure.

253
00:40:20,347 --> 00:40:23,942
- Don't go off on your own.
- Hey, don't worry about me.

254
00:40:27,227 --> 00:40:30,139
- Good luck.
- Yeah. Thanks.

255
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:50,502
- Is this okay?
- It's fine.
- Do I look all right?

256
00:40:52,107 --> 00:40:54,780
Hyah! Go on, mule!

257
00:41:00,347 --> 00:41:03,498
Heather, sit on my lap here
and give me a kiss.

258
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:06,021
- Shut up, Clyde. I'm workin'.
- In pants.

259
00:41:06,107 --> 00:41:08,780
Why don't you put on
a pretty dress for us?

260
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:11,222
- 'Cause I couldn't do this.
- Whoa!

261
00:41:13,067 --> 00:41:15,740
Don't you love me any more, Heather?

262
00:41:18,747 --> 00:41:22,501
It's a miracle
how beautiful you really are.

263
00:41:22,587 --> 00:41:25,147
Oh.

264
00:41:25,227 --> 00:41:27,900
- Who's that?
- He's Scott Conroy's son.

265
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:31,775
- I brought him up here.
- How remarkable.

266
00:41:31,867 --> 00:41:34,859
- He even looks like Scott.
- Mm-hmm.

267
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:41,617
- Belinda Casey.
- Jack Conroy. How are you?

268
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,983
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

269
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:47,422
- Uh, do you work here?
- I own the place.

270
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:50,465
- Oh. Great.
- Would you like a drink?

271
00:41:50,547 --> 00:41:54,256
- Yeah, I'd love one.
- Shouldn't you be at Bradford's? Hmm?

272
00:41:55,707 --> 00:41:57,425
Yeah, uh...

273
00:41:58,867 --> 00:42:02,303
Uh, a pleasure meeting you.
Uh, bye, Alex.

274
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:03,706
Bye.

275
00:42:04,987 --> 00:42:09,902
- Right. There you go.
- Three more.

276
00:42:09,987 --> 00:42:12,865
- See you at the bar.
- Sun never shines.

277
00:42:15,307 --> 00:42:18,822
- He wants you back tomorrow.
- Hey, pass me down the counter.

278
00:42:18,907 --> 00:42:21,216
Comin' through.

279
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:24,976
Joshua!

280
00:42:30,387 --> 00:42:33,060
- Miss Casey.
- Oh, Jack!

281
00:42:33,147 --> 00:42:34,660
- Hi.
- Hi!
- How are you?

282
00:42:34,747 --> 00:42:37,102
- I'm well, thank you.
- Can I get that for you?
- Yes, you certainly can. Got it?

283
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,985
- Yeah. Yeah.
- So, how'd you make out?
Did you find someplace to stay?

284
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:41,944
- Yeah, I did.
- Uh-huh.

285
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:45,542
- Do you know anybody else here?
- Uh, just you and Alex.

286
00:42:45,627 --> 00:42:47,902
Uh-huh. Well, would you like
to join us for dinner?

287
00:42:47,987 --> 00:42:50,296
- Yeah, I'd love to.
- Good.

288
00:42:50,387 --> 00:42:53,140
- Come by in an hour.
- Okay.

289
00:42:53,227 --> 00:42:55,616
You heard they made Alcatraz
into a prison, didn't you?

290
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:58,858
- No!
- Yeah.
- When I lived there it was
used for immigration, I think.

291
00:42:58,947 --> 00:43:03,179
Uh, not any more.
Now they've got federal prisoners
there, uh, you know, uh...

292
00:43:03,267 --> 00:43:06,657
soldiers that deserted during the war
and some of the Indians from Arizona.

293
00:43:06,747 --> 00:43:10,501
Indians? Oh, that's horrible.

294
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:13,499
- I'll get some dessert.
Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.

295
00:43:16,147 --> 00:43:18,820
Get out of here. Now.

296
00:43:18,907 --> 00:43:22,263
- Take me where I want to go.
- No.

297
00:43:22,347 --> 00:43:25,020
Then I'm stayin'.

298
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:31,461
I'll think about it,
if you get out of here in two seconds.

299
00:43:33,787 --> 00:43:36,255
- You're not leaving.
- Uh, yes, ma'am. Thank you for dinner.

300
00:43:36,347 --> 00:43:38,144
It was delicious, uh...

301
00:43:40,107 --> 00:43:43,338
Can I borrow that book?
I promise I'll return it.

302
00:43:43,427 --> 00:43:47,215
- Good night, Alex.
- Good night.

303
00:43:47,307 --> 00:43:50,219
You know, I think
he really likes you.

304
00:43:54,107 --> 00:43:57,304
And how about you, my dear Belinda?

305
00:44:05,387 --> 00:44:09,016
Then he said, "If I could walk that way,
I wouldn't need the talcum powder."

306
00:44:09,107 --> 00:44:11,860
- That'll cover me.
- Get out.

307
00:44:11,947 --> 00:44:15,826
Hyah, mule! Come on, mule!
Giddap! Giddap!

308
00:44:39,547 --> 00:44:42,903
The lines are wrong.

309
00:44:42,987 --> 00:44:46,502
- What makes you the expert?
- Experience.

310
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,536
It'll be hard for us to control.

311
00:44:52,547 --> 00:44:57,223
- Does that mean we're partners?
- It means that I'll take you
to your father's mine.

312
00:44:57,307 --> 00:44:59,537
That's all it means.

313
00:45:59,187 --> 00:46:01,303
I'll miss you.

314
00:46:01,387 --> 00:46:05,426
I'll miss you too. Next year
we'll have that hotel in San Francisco.

315
00:46:05,507 --> 00:46:08,783
Come on, Alex, kiss her.
I won't look.

316
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:11,779
This time. You'll see.

317
00:46:22,467 --> 00:46:24,901
- See ya!
- Bye!
- Belinda!

318
00:46:26,307 --> 00:46:28,696
Feed the dogs.

319
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:31,096
Boy, you are a romantic, aren't ya?

320
00:47:23,547 --> 00:47:26,505
- Who are they, Alex?
- They are Han Indians.

321
00:47:26,587 --> 00:47:29,579
I know the chief of this tribe.
We'll stop here for the night.

322
00:47:41,787 --> 00:47:44,824
We've come to see Grey Beaver.

323
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,777
- Good to see you, my friend.
- And you.

324
00:48:02,867 --> 00:48:05,506
It's been a long time.

325
00:48:05,587 --> 00:48:08,499
Jack, this is Grey Beaver.

326
00:48:13,947 --> 00:48:17,576
The boat is taking water.
We have to re-tar it.

327
00:48:17,667 --> 00:48:20,386
Fine.

328
00:48:29,227 --> 00:48:31,661
- What's his name?
- Mia Tuk.

329
00:48:31,747 --> 00:48:35,183
- What does that mean?
- White Fang.

330
00:48:41,227 --> 00:48:43,536
Hi, Mia Tuk.

331
00:48:46,867 --> 00:48:48,858
Can I pet you?

332
00:48:55,587 --> 00:48:58,306
- No.
- I just wanted to pet him.

333
00:48:58,387 --> 00:49:04,826
- Dogs are for work.
- Well, maybe they'd work a little harder
if you were a little more friendly.

334
00:49:04,907 --> 00:49:07,819
We make fire.
Kill with sticks.

335
00:49:09,907 --> 00:49:12,057
Cause stones to fly.

336
00:49:13,347 --> 00:49:17,977
We are their gods.
That is why they obey.

337
00:49:18,067 --> 00:49:20,342
Not because we're friends.

338
00:49:22,947 --> 00:49:24,938
Mia Tuk.

339
00:49:41,867 --> 00:49:44,506
You boys want a stick of gum?

340
00:49:44,587 --> 00:49:46,737
Well, here you go.

341
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:51,337
Thank you very much for dinner.
It was very good.

342
00:50:06,067 --> 00:50:10,663
- I can't sleep when it doesn't get dark.
- You'll get used to it.

343
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,490
They never let you forget.

344
00:50:53,861 --> 00:50:57,410
Now listen, it's not food. You're
supposed to chew it, not swallow it.

345
00:50:57,501 --> 00:50:59,219
All right?

346
00:55:08,901 --> 00:55:10,971
I won't forget you.

347
00:55:31,941 --> 00:55:33,852
Thank you so much.

348
00:56:46,981 --> 00:56:48,892
You're here.

349
00:56:52,381 --> 00:56:55,020
Your father wanted to be buried
on the claim.

350
00:58:15,421 --> 00:58:18,413
When I was younger,
I used to think he was a hero.

351
00:58:18,501 --> 00:58:20,492
My mother would tell me
all these stories about where he was...

352
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:22,492
and what he was doing.

353
00:58:23,661 --> 00:58:25,572
I never knew what was true.

354
00:58:28,381 --> 00:58:31,100
He said he wanted
to give us a better life.

355
00:58:33,941 --> 00:58:36,774
All we wanted was for him to stay.

356
00:58:36,861 --> 00:58:40,137
What took you so long getting up here?
It's been a year.

357
00:58:44,341 --> 00:58:46,252
My mother got sick.

358
00:58:46,341 --> 00:58:48,855
She pull through?

359
00:58:48,941 --> 00:58:51,136
Nah.

360
00:58:51,221 --> 00:58:53,451
Sorry.

361
00:58:58,461 --> 00:59:01,180
I know you want to keep moving, but...

362
00:59:01,261 --> 00:59:03,491
but I've gotta try it here,
settle in here.

363
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:07,736
The gold is further north.

364
00:59:09,861 --> 00:59:12,739
Why don't you try it here, Alex?

365
00:59:12,821 --> 00:59:15,255
There must be gold here, and I know...
I know we can find it.

366
00:59:15,341 --> 00:59:17,650
It's not a bad spot.

367
00:59:21,101 --> 00:59:22,773
I'll get you started.

368
01:00:16,061 --> 01:00:18,939
Holy biscuits!
Look at that dog.

369
01:00:19,021 --> 01:00:21,171
That ain't no dog, you idiot.
That's a wolf.

370
01:00:23,501 --> 01:00:25,776
Come on.
Let's go!

371
01:00:34,061 --> 01:00:36,734
Take him down there.
Let's see what happens.

372
01:00:36,821 --> 01:00:39,381
All right, come on.

373
01:00:43,661 --> 01:00:45,970
Go get him! Go on!

374
01:01:03,781 --> 01:01:06,818
Damn! I want that animal.

375
01:01:06,901 --> 01:01:09,699
- Get Buck out of there.
- Buck!

376
01:01:09,781 --> 01:01:12,090
- Buck, easy, boy.
- Get back.
- Easy, Buck.

377
01:01:12,181 --> 01:01:14,900
- Get back.
- Easy.

378
01:01:14,981 --> 01:01:17,495
Sorry. I'm overstocked as it is.

379
01:01:17,581 --> 01:01:19,697
Down, boy. Sit.

380
01:01:19,781 --> 01:01:21,658
Sit! Easy.

381
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:24,096
Mia Tuk, no!

382
01:01:29,461 --> 01:01:32,180
Is he yours?

383
01:01:32,261 --> 01:01:34,377
Well, look what your wolf
done to my dog here.

384
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:36,975
Who's gonna pay for the damages?

385
01:01:39,941 --> 01:01:42,978
You know it's illegal to bring
wolves into town, don't you?

386
01:01:43,061 --> 01:01:46,417
Luke, go find us a Mountie.

387
01:01:46,501 --> 01:01:48,412
He'll straighten this out.

388
01:01:49,661 --> 01:01:51,572
Wait.

389
01:01:53,141 --> 01:01:55,052
Here.

390
01:01:59,141 --> 01:02:01,530
Not interested in furs, Chief.

391
01:02:01,621 --> 01:02:05,375
But I'll take that wolf
off your hands.

392
01:02:05,461 --> 01:02:08,692
- No, it's not for sale.
- Well, that's too damn bad.

393
01:02:08,781 --> 01:02:11,614
'Cause now you're gonna spend
some time in jail.

394
01:02:11,701 --> 01:02:14,261
Go find him, Luke.

395
01:02:14,341 --> 01:02:16,457
No!

396
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:20,811
How much?

397
01:02:22,541 --> 01:02:26,454
You know something, Chief?
You're shrewd.

398
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:28,452
Come on!

399
01:02:29,941 --> 01:02:33,013
This wolf's gonna make us
a lot of money.

400
01:02:33,101 --> 01:02:35,012
Get in there!

401
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:41,974
Looks like he's takin' to the place.

402
01:02:42,061 --> 01:02:44,097
Come on.
I'll buy you a drink.

403
01:02:50,101 --> 01:02:52,217
I don't believe it!

404
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:55,020
Hey, wolf.

405
01:02:55,101 --> 01:02:58,252
Hey, wolf.
Show those teeth!

406
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:00,252
Go!

407
01:03:23,021 --> 01:03:27,094
My hands hurt,
my head hurts, my feet hurt.

408
01:03:27,181 --> 01:03:30,617
Let's-Let's get some dynamite
and blow the whole damn mountain up.

409
01:03:30,701 --> 01:03:32,771
Huh? What do you say?

410
01:03:32,861 --> 01:03:35,819
That would be too easy.

411
01:03:46,821 --> 01:03:50,860
- What's the story in that one?
- Well, it's about this man who...

412
01:03:50,941 --> 01:03:53,501
He builds a machine
that takes him into the future.

413
01:03:56,901 --> 01:04:00,257
I can teach you to read.

414
01:04:00,341 --> 01:04:03,060
You teach me to read...

415
01:04:03,141 --> 01:04:04,176
I'll make you a miner.

416
01:04:04,261 --> 01:04:05,853
Deal.

417
01:04:11,221 --> 01:04:14,213
All right, wolf.
Let's see what you got.

418
01:04:14,301 --> 01:04:16,974
Come on, wolf!
Come on! Yeah! Yeah!

419
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:19,416
Come on! That's it!
Look, wolf! Yeah.

420
01:04:19,501 --> 01:04:22,379
Come on, wolf!
Hold him!

421
01:04:22,461 --> 01:04:24,736
Come on, wolf! Come on.
Come on, come on.

422
01:04:24,821 --> 01:04:27,176
Come on! Let's see what you got.
Come on!

423
01:04:29,301 --> 01:04:31,735
Come on!
Come on, wolf! Come on!

424
01:04:33,821 --> 01:04:36,574
Come on, wolf.
There you go.

425
01:04:36,661 --> 01:04:39,221
That's it. That's it.
Come on!

426
01:04:40,861 --> 01:04:43,773
Yeah! Yeah!
Ow! Oh.

427
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:48,331
I think he's ready.

428
01:04:54,941 --> 01:04:57,057
Wolf, don't you let me down.

429
01:04:57,141 --> 01:05:00,338
Get mad! Come on, get mad!
Get in there and kill him.

430
01:05:00,421 --> 01:05:02,457
You understand?
Come on!

431
01:05:09,861 --> 01:05:12,500
Come on.

432
01:05:12,581 --> 01:05:16,256
Come on. Let's go.

433
01:05:16,341 --> 01:05:19,731
Come on, get mean.

434
01:05:19,821 --> 01:05:22,415
Let's get mad.

435
01:05:22,501 --> 01:05:24,492
Come on!

436
01:05:24,581 --> 01:05:27,539
Let's get him!
Come on!

437
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:34,492
Come on!

438
01:05:40,901 --> 01:05:44,018
Gentlemen, on three.

439
01:05:44,101 --> 01:05:47,855
One, two, three!

440
01:05:55,261 --> 01:05:59,049
Kill him! Tear him up, wolf!
Tear him up!

441
01:05:59,141 --> 01:06:00,938
- Kill him, wolf!
- Tear him up!

442
01:06:01,021 --> 01:06:03,410
Get in there!
Get in there, wolf!

443
01:06:06,381 --> 01:06:10,659
- Yeah!
- Yes! Yes!

444
01:06:10,741 --> 01:06:13,050
Yes!

445
01:06:18,861 --> 01:06:22,410
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on, wolf. You did good.

446
01:06:22,501 --> 01:06:24,537
It's a pleasure
taking your money, Sykes.

447
01:06:24,621 --> 01:06:28,819
- I'll be back, Smith.
- Next time, bring a live dog.

448
01:06:32,061 --> 01:06:33,972
Okay, wolf, come on.
I want you to get mad.

449
01:06:34,061 --> 01:06:37,292
Now, I want you to get in there and win,
you understand me? Understand?

450
01:06:37,381 --> 01:06:42,375
All right, on three.
One, two, three!

451
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:44,691
Come on, quick!
Quick! Yeah!

452
01:06:46,741 --> 01:06:48,652
Yes.

453
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:54,536
One, two, three!

454
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:59,135
- Come on! Come on!
- Go get him!

455
01:07:19,741 --> 01:07:21,891
Easy, boy.

456
01:07:21,981 --> 01:07:23,892
You done good tonight.

457
01:07:25,421 --> 01:07:27,139
I brought you something extra.

458
01:07:31,661 --> 01:07:33,856
Take it easy.
Here you go.

459
01:07:44,981 --> 01:07:47,495
You just keep on hatin' me, wolf.

460
01:08:06,781 --> 01:08:10,296
"It took days
for the boys to reach...

461
01:08:10,381 --> 01:08:14,932
the secluded...

462
01:08:15,021 --> 01:08:16,932
hideaway.

463
01:08:17,021 --> 01:08:21,060
No one had set foot
into the 'housie'...

464
01:08:21,141 --> 01:08:22,494
- House.
- For years...
- House.

465
01:08:22,581 --> 01:08:24,936
- Into the..."
- Not "housie." House.

466
01:08:25,021 --> 01:08:27,615
- House.
- House.
- House.

467
01:08:27,701 --> 01:08:31,580
"For years.
When the door was finally...

468
01:08:31,661 --> 01:08:33,970
opened and, uh...

469
01:08:36,181 --> 01:08:38,490
the fou... fou-fou..."

470
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:41,653
The fowl?
Like the birds?

471
01:08:41,741 --> 01:08:44,209
No, no.
Fowl like the birds is F-O-W-L.

472
01:08:44,301 --> 01:08:46,610
This is F-O-U-L.
Foul.

473
01:08:46,701 --> 01:08:49,169
Like-Like a bad smell.
Like rotten.

474
01:08:49,261 --> 01:08:51,172
Like your socks smell foul.

475
01:08:53,701 --> 01:08:56,898
- I wash them.
- Yeah, well, use some soap, would you?

476
01:08:56,981 --> 01:08:59,449
If you'd spend as much time digging
as you do washing, then of course...

477
01:08:59,541 --> 01:09:01,736
l-I do more than my share around here.

478
01:09:01,821 --> 01:09:04,938
That's a laugh.
Who do you think does all the cooking?

479
01:09:05,021 --> 01:09:08,809
You do. You definitely do.
And with the way you cook,
I'm lucky to still be alive.

480
01:09:08,901 --> 01:09:12,337
Then do your own damn cooking!
I'm not your wife!

481
01:09:12,421 --> 01:09:15,254
Yeah. Yeah, that's for sure.
You're too damn ugly.

482
01:09:15,341 --> 01:09:17,696
That's U-G-L-Y.

483
01:09:33,261 --> 01:09:36,412
Maybe we ought to
head into town tomorrow.

484
01:09:36,501 --> 01:09:38,617
We need supplies anyway.

485
01:09:38,701 --> 01:09:40,612
Good idea.

486
01:09:42,301 --> 01:09:44,212
I tell you,
that wolf's unbeatable.

487
01:09:44,301 --> 01:09:47,259
Unbeatable!

488
01:09:47,341 --> 01:09:49,491
Get away from that cage!
Get him away there, Tinker.

489
01:09:49,581 --> 01:09:52,141
- Get back!
- You wanna lose a hand, buddy?

490
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:54,610
Mr Sykes.

491
01:09:54,701 --> 01:09:57,135
Step aside, gentlemen.

492
01:09:58,501 --> 01:10:00,412
What have you brought for us today?

493
01:10:05,101 --> 01:10:07,296
- Where's the rest of him?
- That's a bulldog.

494
01:10:07,381 --> 01:10:09,815
- He's pretty.
- They're killers, you moron.

495
01:10:09,901 --> 01:10:13,371
- Look at them jaws!
- Shut up!
- It's Cherokee. I've seen him fight.

496
01:10:13,461 --> 01:10:15,292
Your dog's unbeatable, right?

497
01:10:15,381 --> 01:10:19,454
I've got 5,000 that says
he won't be after today.

498
01:10:19,541 --> 01:10:22,294
What's the matter, Smith?
Too rich for your blood?

499
01:10:24,981 --> 01:10:26,892
Let's do it.

500
01:10:36,061 --> 01:10:41,135
Gentlemen, on three.
One, two, three!

501
01:10:41,221 --> 01:10:43,337
Get him!

502
01:10:48,061 --> 01:10:49,619
Come on, wolf!

503
01:11:14,581 --> 01:11:16,970
Cherokee!

504
01:11:17,061 --> 01:11:19,416
- Cherokee!
- Wolf!

505
01:11:19,501 --> 01:11:22,732
- Wolf!
- Cherokee!

506
01:11:22,821 --> 01:11:24,937
Cherokee!

507
01:11:25,021 --> 01:11:27,854
- Come on!
- Come on!

508
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:47,412
Aw! Damn!

509
01:12:09,421 --> 01:12:12,015
- Flip him over!
- Come on, wolf, get up! Get up, wolf!

510
01:12:12,101 --> 01:12:14,535
- Come on! Come on!
- Get up!

511
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:17,260
- Hey, that's White Fang.
- Get up, wolf!
- Stay out of this.

512
01:12:17,341 --> 01:12:21,539
- It's over!
- Not yet it ain't.

513
01:12:21,621 --> 01:12:23,691
Come on, wolf!
Get up and fight!

514
01:12:27,781 --> 01:12:29,612
Will somebody give me a hand here?

515
01:12:29,701 --> 01:12:32,738
- Get this dog off of him.
- I'll help you, son. I got him.

516
01:12:32,821 --> 01:12:35,972
- Let go, there.
- Hey, don't break those teeth!

517
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:38,336
Let go, dog.

518
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:42,573
- Mounties! Mounties!
- Hey, kid! Hey!

519
01:12:42,661 --> 01:12:45,095
- Kid, that's my wolf!
- Yeah, he was.

520
01:12:45,181 --> 01:12:47,411
I paid for him when you robbed me
in Skagway. Remember me?

521
01:12:47,501 --> 01:12:49,253
- Oh, yeah?
- Easy.

522
01:12:50,541 --> 01:12:52,452
You stay.

523
01:12:56,341 --> 01:13:00,016
Hey, you two, keep an eye out for me.
This ain't finished yet!

524
01:13:08,421 --> 01:13:11,538
He's lost a lot of blood.

525
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:18,658
At least he won't have
to fight any more.

526
01:13:20,461 --> 01:13:22,497
Good night, Jack.

527
01:14:00,661 --> 01:14:04,574
I remember the good old days
when dogs used to pull men.

528
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:08,619
He needs to be in the cabin
so I can take care of him.

529
01:14:08,701 --> 01:14:11,579
I'm not sleeping
in the same room with a wolf.

530
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:24,134
- You're wasting your time.
- He was tame once.

531
01:14:24,221 --> 01:14:26,132
- You saw him.
- He was.

532
01:14:29,501 --> 01:14:32,299
He's not any more.

533
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:41,293
Don't give up on me, you hear?

534
01:14:58,141 --> 01:15:02,100
Congratulations. You've got
a healthy wolf on your hands.

535
01:15:02,181 --> 01:15:05,014
Now get him outside.

536
01:15:05,101 --> 01:15:07,092
I can't do that by myself.

537
01:15:10,301 --> 01:15:12,212
Hold out a piece of meat.

538
01:15:13,381 --> 01:15:16,100
I'll unhook him.

539
01:15:26,341 --> 01:15:29,731
Look at him watching my hand.
They beat him bad.

540
01:15:29,821 --> 01:15:32,289
There is no taming him now.

541
01:15:32,381 --> 01:15:37,296
He was taught to hate. All he needs
is a little bit of kindness.

542
01:15:43,061 --> 01:15:46,610
- Try it without the wood.
- You try it without the wood.

543
01:15:47,541 --> 01:15:50,101
Easy. Easy.

544
01:15:59,981 --> 01:16:02,893
Okay. Okay.

545
01:16:11,701 --> 01:16:13,771
Okay.

546
01:16:23,941 --> 01:16:26,375
- Are you crazy?
- No.

547
01:16:26,461 --> 01:16:29,658
I know what I'm doing.
I hope.

548
01:16:32,701 --> 01:16:37,013
Just gonna untangle this.
Here we go.

549
01:16:42,661 --> 01:16:45,050
Turn him loose.

550
01:16:45,141 --> 01:16:47,052
He belongs in the woods.

551
01:16:55,301 --> 01:16:57,212
I know you don't want to hurt me.

552
01:16:58,941 --> 01:17:01,774
But you're right.
I shouldn't have done that.

553
01:17:01,861 --> 01:17:04,421
I shouldn't have tried to force you.

554
01:17:04,501 --> 01:17:07,971
I don't know what they did to you,
but everybody's not like that.

555
01:17:08,061 --> 01:17:09,972
I promise.

556
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:13,892
It's gonna be all right.

557
01:17:13,981 --> 01:17:15,892
So you come on out
when you're ready.

558
01:17:32,061 --> 01:17:35,770
- You forgot something.
- Just wait.

559
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:01,652
Now what?

560
01:18:19,021 --> 01:18:21,330
You hungry, boy?

561
01:18:21,421 --> 01:18:24,094
Yeah, of course you're hungry.
You're always hungry.

562
01:18:26,861 --> 01:18:28,817
Where you going?

563
01:18:30,701 --> 01:18:33,499
Looks pretty good, huh?

564
01:18:33,581 --> 01:18:35,492
Hey, White Fang. Hey.

565
01:18:37,621 --> 01:18:40,010
See? That was pretty good, huh?

566
01:18:40,101 --> 01:18:42,012
Hey. Hey.

567
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:51,452
It's not so bad, huh?

568
01:18:53,221 --> 01:18:55,132
Want a little more, maybe?

569
01:18:57,461 --> 01:19:00,897
Hey, hey!
Come on, boy.

570
01:19:00,981 --> 01:19:03,370
It's okay.

571
01:19:03,461 --> 01:19:06,259
It's not so bad.

572
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:08,252
I'm a pretty nice guy.

573
01:19:10,461 --> 01:19:12,611
Maybe a little more?

574
01:19:12,701 --> 01:19:14,612
Hey.

575
01:19:18,821 --> 01:19:21,130
Come on. Hey!

576
01:19:21,221 --> 01:19:23,257
White Fang, hey, look at this.

577
01:19:30,421 --> 01:19:32,332
Want a little more, maybe?

578
01:19:34,501 --> 01:19:37,971
Hey, hey!
Come on, boy.

579
01:19:38,061 --> 01:19:40,052
It's okay.

580
01:19:40,141 --> 01:19:42,814
Yeah, not so bad.
Not so bad.

581
01:19:44,621 --> 01:19:46,851
Don't tell me you're not hungry.

582
01:19:46,941 --> 01:19:49,455
Here you go. Here you go.
Here you go.

583
01:19:49,541 --> 01:19:51,691
Moving slow.

584
01:20:03,781 --> 01:20:05,931
Come here.

585
01:20:07,301 --> 01:20:10,452
Huh? Huh? Huh?
I'm sorry.

586
01:20:18,381 --> 01:20:21,339
Huh? A little more?

587
01:20:21,421 --> 01:20:23,332
Here you go.

588
01:20:26,141 --> 01:20:27,972
I ain't gonna hurt you.

589
01:20:28,061 --> 01:20:30,370
Not so bad.

590
01:20:33,661 --> 01:20:37,176
Good? It's all right.

591
01:20:37,261 --> 01:20:39,172
It's all right.

592
01:20:51,821 --> 01:20:53,732
We're gonna be okay.

593
01:20:56,061 --> 01:20:57,972
Hey, hey, hey!

594
01:21:06,581 --> 01:21:10,051
That fool.

595
01:21:10,141 --> 01:21:11,893
Watch out!

596
01:21:13,941 --> 01:21:16,057
Put the rifle down!
Put it down!

597
01:21:22,981 --> 01:21:24,892
He won't hurt me.

598
01:21:28,581 --> 01:21:30,492
See?

599
01:21:35,141 --> 01:21:38,053
You scared the hell out of me.

600
01:21:38,141 --> 01:21:40,939
I told you he was intelligent.

601
01:21:44,701 --> 01:21:46,612
All right, come on.
Come on!

602
01:22:04,261 --> 01:22:07,651
Up. Come on.
Come on, get it.

603
01:22:07,741 --> 01:22:10,255
All right, come on.

604
01:22:10,341 --> 01:22:12,138
Hey.

605
01:22:18,061 --> 01:22:21,610
Oh! Oh! Hey, hey!
Hey, whoa. Whoa. Get back here.

606
01:22:28,581 --> 01:22:30,617
I'm gonna go back in
and get one more load.

607
01:22:30,701 --> 01:22:33,613
- Don't. It's late.
- Come on, boy.

608
01:22:45,781 --> 01:22:48,500
Jack! Jack!

609
01:22:57,301 --> 01:22:59,417
- Alex!
- Jack?

610
01:22:59,501 --> 01:23:01,378
Alex, help!

611
01:23:04,901 --> 01:23:08,177
- Jack?
- Help! Alex!

612
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:15,452
Hey, buddy.

613
01:23:23,621 --> 01:23:25,851
- Are you all right?
- Oh!

614
01:23:25,941 --> 01:23:27,852
The sky never looked so blue.

615
01:23:32,581 --> 01:23:35,891
- No, it can't be.
- What?

616
01:23:59,461 --> 01:24:03,579
Holy mackerel!
We're-We're rich. Aren't we?

617
01:24:03,661 --> 01:24:06,733
- It's just like we dreamed of.
- It's gold, all right.

618
01:24:08,541 --> 01:24:11,135
If the quality is bad,
it won't be worth much.

619
01:24:11,221 --> 01:24:15,658
No sense getting crazy just yet.

620
01:24:16,661 --> 01:24:18,572
Good boy.

621
01:24:21,101 --> 01:24:24,013
You're sure you don't want
to take him with you?

622
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:26,171
No. There'll be too many people.

623
01:24:28,861 --> 01:24:30,772
Okay. Bye-bye.

624
01:24:32,261 --> 01:24:36,300
Listen, don't get caught up
in anything there.

625
01:24:36,381 --> 01:24:39,418
Just get in, get it tested...

626
01:24:39,501 --> 01:24:41,776
and get back here.

627
01:24:41,861 --> 01:24:43,772
As soon as I can.

628
01:24:45,701 --> 01:24:47,851
What are you gonna do without me?

629
01:24:47,941 --> 01:24:50,057
I'll yell at the wolf.

630
01:25:01,381 --> 01:25:03,531
I guess he's coming with me.

631
01:25:05,581 --> 01:25:07,970
I'll pick up a new window.

632
01:25:17,341 --> 01:25:21,778
How you doing?
I'd like to have this tested.

633
01:25:21,861 --> 01:25:23,852
I'm on claim number seven...

634
01:25:23,941 --> 01:25:26,580
right below Discovery on Blue Creek.

635
01:25:26,661 --> 01:25:29,778
I assume you want
to deposit this with our bank.

636
01:25:29,861 --> 01:25:31,931
Yes. Yes, you assume correct.

637
01:25:32,021 --> 01:25:35,058
I don't know...

638
01:25:35,141 --> 01:25:37,894
What is it, huh?

639
01:25:37,981 --> 01:25:40,654
I hope he's been fed.

640
01:25:48,541 --> 01:25:51,135
Here it is.
Fee and deposit paid for...

641
01:25:51,221 --> 01:25:54,258
by Scott Conroy
in his name and his son's.

642
01:25:54,341 --> 01:25:57,253
- You Jack Conroy?
- Yeah, yeah, that's me.

643
01:25:57,341 --> 01:26:01,254
I'd also like you to add Alex, uh...
Alexander Larson's name to that.

644
01:26:01,341 --> 01:26:03,297
It's your gold.

645
01:26:41,141 --> 01:26:43,609
Oh. He's completely recovered.

646
01:26:43,701 --> 01:26:46,135
- All right. We gotta get going.
- How you doing, fella?

647
01:26:46,221 --> 01:26:50,294
- But you just got here, Jack.
- Well, we've got some, uh, things to do.

648
01:26:50,381 --> 01:26:53,293
- All right.
Don't forget what you came for.
- Oh, right.

649
01:26:53,381 --> 01:26:55,576
- Come on, White Fang.
- Take care, Jack, and be careful.

650
01:26:55,661 --> 01:26:57,777
- I will. Bye-bye.
- Come on.

651
01:27:07,021 --> 01:27:09,057
- What did they say?
- Who?

652
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:12,372
The assayer, who else?
What's wrong with you?

653
01:27:12,461 --> 01:27:15,180
Well, read for yourself.

654
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:21,612
"The...

655
01:27:23,821 --> 01:27:26,381
quality...

656
01:27:26,461 --> 01:27:28,929
of gold found at the claim...

657
01:27:29,021 --> 01:27:33,572
of Jack Conroy and Alexander..."

658
01:27:33,661 --> 01:27:36,221
"Larson, tested and weighed by
the assayer at Klondike City...

659
01:27:36,301 --> 01:27:38,496
on the 11th day of August, 1898...

660
01:27:38,581 --> 01:27:40,697
is found to be 98% pure."

661
01:27:40,781 --> 01:27:42,692
We're rich.

662
01:27:44,821 --> 01:27:47,574
We are rich!

663
01:27:47,661 --> 01:27:50,494
Very rich. That's what the guy says.
The guy says very rich.

664
01:27:50,581 --> 01:27:52,731
He says we are filthy,
stinkin' rich!

665
01:28:10,181 --> 01:28:13,093
While you were gone...

666
01:28:13,181 --> 01:28:16,730
I did some thinking.

667
01:28:16,821 --> 01:28:19,255
I'd like you to come back with us
to San Francisco...

668
01:28:21,741 --> 01:28:24,209
to be part owner of our hotel.

669
01:28:28,901 --> 01:28:31,051
So, what do you think?

670
01:28:32,901 --> 01:28:35,893
Well, l-I think
it sounds like a good idea.

671
01:28:35,981 --> 01:28:39,815
I'll name it after your father...
The Royal Scott Hotel.

672
01:28:42,101 --> 01:28:45,093
To your father.

673
01:28:45,181 --> 01:28:47,297
Good friend.

674
01:28:49,581 --> 01:28:51,492
Dream on, boys.

675
01:29:06,461 --> 01:29:08,417
There's something on the roof.

676
01:29:24,061 --> 01:29:26,052
You must have been followed.

677
01:29:28,621 --> 01:29:30,691
I was careful, Alex.
I did what you...

678
01:29:32,941 --> 01:29:35,216
White Fang, get under here.
Come on.

679
01:29:39,261 --> 01:29:41,650
They stuffed the pipe!

680
01:29:50,741 --> 01:29:52,413
Stay down!

681
01:29:57,461 --> 01:29:59,691
Put this over your head.

682
01:29:59,781 --> 01:30:02,090
It will help you breathe.

683
01:30:04,581 --> 01:30:07,493
They can't stay in there much longer.
Hold your fire till they come out.

684
01:30:07,581 --> 01:30:10,937
Maybe they're dead.

685
01:30:15,141 --> 01:30:18,053
That's "Coming 'Round The Mountain,"
ain't it?

686
01:30:19,301 --> 01:30:21,451
I hate that song.

687
01:30:27,821 --> 01:30:29,698
That'll keep them guessing.

688
01:30:39,261 --> 01:30:41,536
They ain't takin' the hint.

689
01:31:14,741 --> 01:31:16,652
Let's move in.

690
01:31:20,101 --> 01:31:22,934
Get in there, Tinker.
Well, earn your keep!

691
01:32:02,781 --> 01:32:07,297
Hey, get him off of me!
Get him off of me!

692
01:32:10,901 --> 01:32:13,051
Hey!

693
01:32:13,141 --> 01:32:15,291
Easy, easy, easy.

694
01:32:15,381 --> 01:32:19,738
Come on. Easy. Easy.

695
01:32:19,981 --> 01:32:23,132
Hey, look at this, now.
Look at it. Look at it.

696
01:32:23,221 --> 01:32:25,815
Well, will you look at this now.

697
01:32:28,621 --> 01:32:32,330
- You had it comin' boys!
- Yeah, you sure did!

698
01:32:32,421 --> 01:32:35,538
- Hey, go get us the Mounties, would ya?
- Yes, sir!
- Hey, wait up!

699
01:32:35,621 --> 01:32:38,215
- Come on, everybody. Free drinks.
- Hey, let me in there.

700
01:32:38,301 --> 01:32:41,020
- Come on in.
- Free drinks?

701
01:32:41,101 --> 01:32:43,331
- I'm right behind ya!
- Free drinks on Alex Larson.

702
01:32:43,421 --> 01:32:45,696
- Set 'em up, will ya?
- Don't ask me twice.

703
01:32:58,421 --> 01:33:00,616
Bring another keg of beer.

704
01:33:09,941 --> 01:33:12,580
If we are going to catch
that boat in Skagway...

705
01:33:12,661 --> 01:33:16,131
we've got to leave soon.

706
01:33:16,221 --> 01:33:18,576
You know you can't take him with you.

707
01:33:18,661 --> 01:33:20,572
He'd be miserable in the city.

708
01:33:23,821 --> 01:33:27,655
He has to run free.
That's his magic.

709
01:33:30,901 --> 01:33:32,732
He thinks you are a wolf.

710
01:34:42,661 --> 01:34:45,494
Come here.
All right.

711
01:34:45,581 --> 01:34:47,492
You take care of yourself, all right?

712
01:34:55,261 --> 01:34:58,298
All right, go on.
You're free. Go on.

713
01:35:02,701 --> 01:35:04,612
Go on!
Get outta here!

714
01:35:06,981 --> 01:35:09,495
Listen to me!
Go, go! Go!

715
01:35:11,901 --> 01:35:13,812
Go!

716
01:35:16,421 --> 01:35:19,299
Go on! Go!

717
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:22,339
Listen to me! Go!

718
01:35:22,421 --> 01:35:24,935
Get outta here! Go!

719
01:35:25,021 --> 01:35:26,693
Go on!

720
01:35:30,501 --> 01:35:32,776
Just get outta here!

721
01:35:41,061 --> 01:35:42,733
Go on!

722
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:39,214
Oh, here he is, Alex.

723
01:36:44,181 --> 01:36:46,217
Where's the wolf?

724
01:36:46,301 --> 01:36:48,735
I let him go.

725
01:37:00,141 --> 01:37:02,780
Bye, Heather.
Don't let them get away with anything.

726
01:37:02,861 --> 01:37:04,613
I won't.

727
01:37:27,661 --> 01:37:29,856
I can't believe
this is actually happening.

728
01:37:35,501 --> 01:37:39,779
Alex, I gotta tell you something.
I'm not... I can't leave.

729
01:37:45,301 --> 01:37:47,337
Not yet.

730
01:37:47,421 --> 01:37:49,457
I'm gonna go back to the claim.

731
01:37:53,421 --> 01:37:55,855
Miss Casey.

732
01:37:56,941 --> 01:37:58,852
So long.

733
01:38:12,181 --> 01:38:14,854
Your father would be proud of you.

734
01:38:19,181 --> 01:38:22,457
- I'll keep an eye on your gold for you.
- You better.

735
01:38:22,541 --> 01:38:25,533
- And leave a room open for me.
- I have to.

736
01:38:25,621 --> 01:38:27,213
You're part owner.

737
01:40:09,421 --> 01:40:11,298
White Fang!
