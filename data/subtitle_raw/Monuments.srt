2
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:42,062
Join us, Ted.

3
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:43,833
<i>It's what Laura
would have wanted.</i>

4
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:54,745
The Great Pyramid of Giza,

5
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,682
also known as
the Great Pyramid of Khufu,

6
00:02:57,717 --> 00:03:01,213
or if we're going
with the Greek, anyone?

7
00:03:02,117 --> 00:03:03,149
Cheops.

8
00:03:03,723 --> 00:03:05,085
Cheops.

9
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,692
But we don't like the name
that the Greek invaders gave it.

10
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:10,453
So we stick with the Egyptian
there, right?

11
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:11,696
Now, construction of the tomb

12
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:13,390
began the day that
they became pharaoh.

13
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:14,424
What can we learn from that?

14
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,272
Burton.

15
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,471
Uh, that they were kings

16
00:03:28,506 --> 00:03:30,583
and that they wanted to be
comfortable in the afterlife.

17
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:31,617
Correct.

18
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:32,750
As usual, Burton.

19
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:34,587
Now, remember,

20
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:35,885
death is not the end

21
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,821
but a brief pause
on our journey.

22
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,219
And don't forget,
your papers are due next week.

23
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:42,925
Hey, Mr. Daniels.

24
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,630
Um, I had a question
about the assignment.

25
00:03:44,665 --> 00:03:45,829
- Of course, you do.
- Yeah.

26
00:03:45,864 --> 00:03:47,930
Well, I'm really excited
about the first paper.

27
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:49,393
Uh, but I'm having a tough time

28
00:03:49,428 --> 00:03:52,000
deciding between the judgment
of the dead by Anubis

29
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:53,705
or if I should use
my page account

30
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,234
on a deep dive
into mummification.

31
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,005
Definitely the first one.
100%.

32
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:01,108
I agree.

33
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:03,110
Uh, thanks, Mr. Daniels.

34
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:31,171
Did you just say,
"Olive tuse?"

35
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,579
I did.

36
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:35,472
So drink still?

37
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:36,440
Mm-hm.

38
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:39,916
Are you pretending to be madder
than you actually are

39
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:41,412
because you're trying
to prove a point?

40
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,512
No, I'm not mad.

41
00:04:42,547 --> 00:04:44,591
I'm just being principled,
I'm standing my ground.

42
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:45,856
We have things to talk about.

43
00:04:45,891 --> 00:04:47,286
That's great.

44
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,156
I'm just excited to have a state
of the union with you again.

45
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:51,290
I missed you.

46
00:04:52,227 --> 00:04:53,160
Good.

47
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,834
Oh, so are you mad?

48
00:04:56,869 --> 00:04:58,198
Are you not mad?

49
00:05:00,037 --> 00:05:02,037
Furious.

50
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:13,180
We separated because I didn't
feel like you cared about us.

51
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,050
You say that you care,

52
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:17,085
but you don't take
the serious things seriously.

53
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
Where's the fun in that?

54
00:05:19,155 --> 00:05:20,517
You need to show me
something different.

55
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:21,628
I'm leaving for good.

56
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:23,421
And you could stay in this
dump town for all I care.

57
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,259
Come on. Two people
with this much chemistry.

58
00:05:26,294 --> 00:05:28,525
Don't just give up because
they had a rough patch.

59
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,394
I am not giving up,

60
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,737
but I need to know
that you value us.

61
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:33,563
No half in and half out.

62
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:34,707
You know, I read somewhere

63
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:36,269
that the most important things
were said three times.

64
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:39,239
So, I promise. I promise.
I promise...

65
00:05:39,274 --> 00:05:41,945
that we'll fight for us
this time.

66
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,881
Your mother always told me
you're trouble.

67
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,245
See, we're made for each other.

68
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
I get us into trouble,
you get us out.

69
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:52,890
So we're just done talking?

70
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:54,991
No, I was just
ordering us drinks

71
00:05:55,026 --> 00:05:56,894
while we continue to talk.

72
00:05:56,929 --> 00:05:59,358
Okay then,
I'll have something pineappley.

73
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:01,195
Okay.

74
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:06,739
Hello. Can I get a Mai Tai
and a something pineappley?

75
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:30,862
Howl called me and he said
that you dumped him for him.

76
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:32,127
Why are you two together?

77
00:06:32,162 --> 00:06:34,063
Crystal, Ted is my husband.

78
00:06:34,098 --> 00:06:35,295
We're going to work it out.

79
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,264
- Cheers, I'm no longer being estranged.
- Mm. Oh!

80
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:38,595
Yeah, now it's just strange.

81
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,772
Crystal.

82
00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:42,071
- That's a good one.
- Shut up!

83
00:06:42,106 --> 00:06:43,600
Does Momma know about this?

84
00:06:43,635 --> 00:06:45,569
Well, we never got divorced
so what is there to know?

85
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:48,176
He was, is and will always be
my husband.

86
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:49,474
God damn it, Howl!

87
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,179
How many times do I have
to ban you from my tiki bar?

88
00:06:51,214 --> 00:06:52,818
It's not my fault
people pick fights with me.

89
00:06:52,853 --> 00:06:55,480
- Will you just get the hell out?
- You get the hell out.

90
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:56,679
It's my bar.

91
00:06:56,714 --> 00:06:59,891
- Oh, great, everyone. Howl's here too.
- Move over.

92
00:06:59,926 --> 00:07:00,793
- Move.
- I'm not...

93
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:05,061
- Oh, you shouldn't have.
- It's for Laura.

94
00:07:05,096 --> 00:07:06,557
Really though
you should not have.

95
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,262
And I got something
to say to you too.

96
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:09,703
Oh, God!

97
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:14,532
Laura, your family loves me,
and I love them.

98
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,106
Howl, we went on one date
because mother made me.

99
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:18,470
I count three dates.
Three.

100
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:19,944
Running into me
at the grocery store

101
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,440
does not count as a date.

102
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,673
Neither does auditing
my photography class.

103
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:24,542
Why are you doing this?

104
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,215
Because I'm married
and uninterested.

105
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,987
- Why can't you two process this?
- Because Ted's a loser.

106
00:07:30,022 --> 00:07:32,187
Crystal, what have I
ever done to you?

107
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:33,826
You're a loser.

108
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:36,686
Laura, I'm not gonna beg.
I'm giving you a chance here.

109
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:39,557
When your mama told me
that you and Ted...

110
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,394
Ted, that will be a great time
to fight for us.

111
00:07:41,429 --> 00:07:44,562
That was my chance
to prove my quality.

112
00:07:44,938 --> 00:07:46,366
And I did.

113
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:51,503
Uh, him? Fight like, fight him?
Uh, physical with our fists?

114
00:07:55,113 --> 00:07:57,476
Okay, finish your drink.

115
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:05,385
- Let's do this, Tracy.
- Don't call me that.

116
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,222
I'm gonna fight you, Trace.

117
00:08:07,257 --> 00:08:09,994
I feel like
my face is falling off.

118
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:12,326
Don't get into a fight
you can't win.

119
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:14,460
That's what I've been
trying to say this whole time.

120
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,726
Come on, sis.
Get your husband home.

121
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:19,333
Can't believe
I'm related to you yahoos.

122
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:20,840
Oh!

123
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:26,439
So how'd I do
for my first fight?

124
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:28,177
Well...

125
00:08:28,212 --> 00:08:30,641
It's the thought
that counts, right?

126
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:36,482
Okay, okay, okay.

127
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,585
Yes! Yes!

128
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:58,938
Hey, uh, is there
a gas station in town?

129
00:09:59,534 --> 00:10:00,434
Yep.

130
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:05,978
Okay, thanks.

131
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:17,385
Thanks.

132
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:21,928
Ah, right.

133
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:27,758
- Keep the change.
- Yep.

134
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:16,147
<i>Ow. Ow!</i>

135
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:18,017
What is happening?

136
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,382
You mind try...

137
00:11:20,648 --> 00:11:22,153
<i>Oh!</i>

138
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:24,749
Must have sexted right off.

139
00:11:32,363 --> 00:11:35,562
I feel like we could
go anywhere...

140
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:37,828
do anything.

141
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:40,600
<i>We're just sort of here.</i>

142
00:11:43,506 --> 00:11:45,407
We never should have
left Chicago.

143
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:47,376
You said you needed your family.

144
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:49,477
No, we did that for you.

145
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,546
You needed a change.

146
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:55,351
I thought that being near
my family would be good for us.

147
00:11:57,355 --> 00:11:59,619
They're just weirder
than I remember.

148
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:03,524
Oh, they're just as weird
as I remember.

149
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:07,198
We can go back, we'll just
find a bag full of cash

150
00:12:07,233 --> 00:12:09,563
and voila,
we're Chicagoians again.

151
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:17,109
You're stagnating again.

152
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,080
Well, leaving is not
gonna fix anything.

153
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,510
We just got back together.

154
00:12:22,545 --> 00:12:25,876
Maybe. Maybe not.
I just...

155
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,482
At least, we're trying.

156
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,617
You're gonna get your way
either way, aren't you?

157
00:12:30,652 --> 00:12:32,586
- I'll give you a chance.
- Okay.

158
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:35,325
Let's take us
out of the equation.

159
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,327
Let the Gods decide.

160
00:12:37,362 --> 00:12:39,197
Heads, we leave.
Tails, we stay.

161
00:12:39,232 --> 00:12:41,826
Uh, I thought I was the one
that got us into trouble.

162
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:42,893
Not anymore.

163
00:12:44,303 --> 00:12:45,665
I have a vision
for who we can be.

164
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,205
I need you to trust me.

165
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,075
And not be half in and half out.

166
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:52,210
Either you're in,

167
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:53,640
or you're out.

168
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:55,840
Flip the coin.

169
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:02,385
Best two out of three.

170
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,189
You're such a cheater.

171
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:07,555
Okay, did I say
best two out of three?

172
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,018
- You did.
- It all rides down...

173
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:10,921
- This is the whole enchilada.
- Okay. This is so much cheating.

174
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,296
You realize that right?

175
00:13:12,331 --> 00:13:14,199
- And the champion of the world is...
- So much... World champion.

176
00:13:14,234 --> 00:13:15,266
Okay.

177
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:16,630
What?

178
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:18,500
What'd you get? What'd you get?
What'd you get? Show me!

179
00:13:18,535 --> 00:13:20,535
I win, I win...

180
00:13:30,217 --> 00:13:31,315
You wanna ride?

181
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,186
Uh, no, I don't take rides
from cheaters.

182
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:37,123
I'm kidding.
I some papers to grade.

183
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:38,355
- But lunch?
- Oh, yeah.

184
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,049
- Okay.
- You're buying.

185
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,053
- Bye.
- Bye.

186
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:53,139
So after Anubis, this guy,
the jackal,

187
00:13:53,174 --> 00:13:55,339
weighs your heart against
the feather of truth. He...

188
00:15:05,378 --> 00:15:07,807
He's been doing
the exact same thing for weeks,

189
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:11,041
Carrying her ashes everywhere
with him like a frickin weirdo.

190
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,813
Something's got to be said.

191
00:15:13,848 --> 00:15:16,222
I'll go settle
this right now.

192
00:15:16,257 --> 00:15:18,114
Get us all banned.

193
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,083
I'll do it.

194
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,725
We have a tradition
in this family.

195
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,563
You're dead daddy's Side
has been here since

196
00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:28,993
before it was a state.

197
00:15:29,765 --> 00:15:31,897
Everyone is at the farm

198
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,603
and that's where Laura
will rest too.

199
00:15:35,837 --> 00:15:39,168
And Ted stole it from us

200
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:40,312
He's a thief.

201
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,942
I don't think you need
to do with Mama wants.

202
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:47,253
But I think you need to
take this seriously.

203
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:48,716
I am taking it seriously.

204
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:49,750
No, you're not.

205
00:15:49,785 --> 00:15:51,422
How can you say that?

206
00:15:51,457 --> 00:15:55,052
You're stuck somewhere between
dealing with it and not.

207
00:15:58,497 --> 00:16:00,057
Half in, half out, right?

208
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,764
Hey, Ted.

209
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,274
I'm worried about what's
happening to you.

210
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,243
I don't need your worry.

211
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,311
I need Laura.

212
00:16:15,745 --> 00:16:17,107
She's gone, man.

213
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:38,964
What do you want, huh?

214
00:16:39,637 --> 00:16:40,735
What should I do now?

215
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:42,473
Okay, you're dead,

216
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:43,837
and I know that.

217
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:46,037
I know that it's on, uh

218
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:49,843
talking to myself.

219
00:16:54,685 --> 00:16:56,146
No, I'm talking to you.

220
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,114
No.

221
00:17:07,698 --> 00:17:10,732
God Grant was right, I'm...

222
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,439
I'm losing it.

223
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,048
What?

224
00:18:04,854 --> 00:18:06,348
Crystal, I got 'em.

225
00:18:07,318 --> 00:18:08,460
You tell your mama.

226
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:10,319
- Meet you at the well.
- <i>Okay.</i>

227
00:18:10,354 --> 00:18:11,320
<i>Hurry up.</i>

228
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,534
<i>What do you mean
someone stole your sister?</i>

229
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:17,568
<i>I thought she was dead?</i>

230
00:18:17,603 --> 00:18:19,262
I mean, her ashes.

231
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:20,164
<i>That makes more sense.</i>

232
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,407
Just let me know if
you hear anything.

233
00:18:21,442 --> 00:18:23,266
- Okay Beth?
- <i>Of course, we'll let you know</i>

234
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:26,170
Look, I know that what
I've been doing

235
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,547
and how I've been behaving
is been not normal.

236
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,045
But, I need some
help here, man.

237
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,851
Where is she?

238
00:18:38,415 --> 00:18:39,524
I think I know.

239
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,119
Come on.

240
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:46,355
Hey, Grant, uh, I've
been seeing her,

241
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:52,130
Laura, and I talk to her.

242
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:56,167
That's not the way
the world works.

243
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,443
Yeah.

244
00:18:57,478 --> 00:19:00,578
Yeah, but it feels real.

245
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:08,245
You're just sad right now and
under a lot of stress.

246
00:19:10,623 --> 00:19:12,183

more sense.

That's Laura's

264
00:20:31,462 --> 00:20:33,462
What else do you plan on
stealing from me today?

265
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:35,838
Stop, both of you.

266
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:37,202
She's gone.

267
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:40,843
We've got to do what we need
to do to put her to rest

268
00:20:40,878 --> 00:20:42,240
and move on.

269
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,553
Join us, Ted.

270
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,380
It's what Laura would
have wanted.

271
00:20:52,725 --> 00:20:56,925
I use this to hold letters Laura
sent me when you were in Chicago.

272
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,239
You got me and your daddy.

273
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,583
God rest his soul's
worst traits

274
00:21:18,949 --> 00:21:21,147
Stubbornness and smarts.

275
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,019
But we loved you.

276
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:30,629
Amen.

277
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,527
I'm not good at this
sort of thing

278
00:21:40,806 --> 00:21:41,739
No.

279
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,170
Amen.

280
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:52,981
We fought last time
we saw each other

281
00:21:55,656 --> 00:21:58,547
I was always hoping
for that moment where

282
00:22:00,089 --> 00:22:02,254
we'd get each other

283
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:05,422
And we'd be friends again.

284
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:07,358
Like, when we were kids

285
00:22:11,804 --> 00:22:13,166
- Amen.
- Amen.

286
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:16,037
I'm just glad that

287
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,041
we can all be here
together for this

288
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:26,047
Lord, our savior and protector

289
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:31,217
has you back
in his loving bosom.

290
00:22:31,956 --> 00:22:33,516
If we're lucky enough

291
00:22:34,926 --> 00:22:38,026
we will be with you soon.

292
00:22:42,593 --> 00:22:43,669
Amen.

293
00:22:45,871 --> 00:22:47,464
Thank you, Percy.

294
00:22:52,174 --> 00:22:53,811
I don't think I'm ready
to say goodbye.

295
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:02,578
I don't know, how
to handle you...

296
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:06,351
you actually being gone.

297
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,420
Just doesn't feel right.

298
00:23:11,897 --> 00:23:14,095
I can make it
right this time.

299
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:17,428
I can get us out of
trouble, I swear.

300
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:21,564
Amen.

301
00:23:39,991 --> 00:23:40,990
I have to set her free.

302
00:23:41,025 --> 00:23:43,256
She told me Chicago
is the answer.

303
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,994
- Bullshit
- she did.

304
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:46,259
- When?
- That's it, just now

305
00:23:46,294 --> 00:23:47,865
I saw her, it's
like a vision.

306
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,526
What, like as a ghost?

307
00:23:51,002 --> 00:23:52,903
I mean, you so completely...

308
00:23:52,938 --> 00:23:53,838
Give it to me!

309
00:23:54,335 --> 00:23:56,236
Hey, It's his wife.

310
00:23:56,271 --> 00:23:57,633
Just let him go.

311
00:24:01,144 --> 00:24:02,275
What!

312
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,130
I don't accept
your apology.

313
00:24:55,165 --> 00:24:56,758
You want to know why Because
you're the one that brought him

314
00:24:56,793 --> 00:24:58,232
over here and this
would have happened

315
00:24:58,267 --> 00:24:59,365
if you didn't do that, Grant.

316
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,839
And why are you walking
away from me?

317
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,203
I'm speaking to you.

318
00:25:02,238 --> 00:25:03,336
Listen, calm down.

319
00:25:03,371 --> 00:25:05,041
That is literally
the worst thing

320
00:25:05,076 --> 00:25:06,405
that he could have
ever said to me.

321
00:25:07,342 --> 00:25:08,880
What are you doing here?

322
00:25:13,953 --> 00:25:14,985
I can't swim.

323
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,019
Unbelievable.

324
00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:17,218
Wow.

325
00:25:18,188 --> 00:25:20,287
What now? Huh?

326
00:25:20,322 --> 00:25:21,750
Just let it go, Okay?

327
00:25:21,785 --> 00:25:23,796
The cars. The cars!

328
00:26:11,274 --> 00:26:12,702
I want to report
a stolen car.

329
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:14,671
You know who stole it?

330
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:15,540
Radio it in.

331
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,641
He just told you where
he was going.

332
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,351
Don't look at me.

333
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:31,061
Theft.

334
00:26:31,096 --> 00:26:33,129
Get a stolen Dodge RAM truck.

335
00:26:33,164 --> 00:26:34,559
Color red.

336
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:35,934
Good amount of rust on it.

337
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,727
Tag number.

338
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,401
How am I supposed to know
the goddamn license plate

339
00:26:41,436 --> 00:26:43,304
to my own truck off
the top of my head?

340
00:26:46,276 --> 00:26:47,913
It's Howl's truck.

341
00:26:47,948 --> 00:26:49,244
Ted stole it.

342
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,114
<i>You still looking
for ashes in?</i>

343
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:52,082
No.

344
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:56,317
Well, yes.

345
00:26:58,222 --> 00:26:59,584
We've got to get her back.

346
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:04,688
Not you.

347
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:07,999
Yes, Momma.

348
00:27:40,231 --> 00:27:42,132
You got a quarter?

349
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:43,496
Lighten this place
up a bit, huh?

350
00:27:47,337 --> 00:27:48,468
Yeah.

351
00:27:51,737 --> 00:27:52,868

You're on.

363
00:28:59,442 --> 00:29:00,837
Ro Sham Bo

364
00:29:02,313 --> 00:29:04,313
Scissors two times in a row.

365
00:29:04,348 --> 00:29:06,909
And it's all tied up.

366
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:11,584
Headed into the Universal
World championship of

367
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:16,028
Who will fill out

368
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:20,560
Ro, sham, bo.

369
00:29:20,595 --> 00:29:22,694
Oh, and he's done it

370
00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:25,631
The incredibly risky strikes

371
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:29,305
Scissor strategy has won it

372
00:29:32,277 --> 00:29:34,574
He takes home the cup.

373
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:37,038
Yeah, a cup of piss.

374
00:29:37,073 --> 00:29:38,116
My piss.

375
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,184
This isn't fair.

376
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,850
And he forgot his
ticket book.

377
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:52,097
Forgot my ticket book.

378
00:29:57,731 --> 00:30:00,270

Any idea who owns
the pickup truck out front?

399
00:32:27,617 --> 00:32:28,748
Yep.

400
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,623
Well, hello again.

401
00:32:35,658 --> 00:32:37,295
It's your first time
running from the cops?

402
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,462
I'm not a 100% sure
they're chasing me.

403
00:32:42,665 --> 00:32:44,962
- Sir?
- Oh, they're chasing you.

404
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:48,097
Question is, why?

405
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,342
My wife, she died.

406
00:32:51,377 --> 00:32:53,476
And I have to scatter her ashes.

407
00:32:53,511 --> 00:32:55,005
Sir?

408
00:32:56,206 --> 00:32:59,317
- What's the hurry?
- Her family has other plans.

409
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,253
Sir? Ma'am?

410
00:33:02,212 --> 00:33:03,486
- Get in.
- Yeah.

411
00:33:06,326 --> 00:33:08,249
- I'm Amber.
- Sir?

412
00:33:08,284 --> 00:33:09,294
It goes there.

413
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,431
Jesus Christ, why is it
full of acorns?

414
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:51,468
That's Sam.

415
00:33:53,604 --> 00:33:54,900
He's gone, too.

416
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,136
You know, I saw you at the bar,
I knew we were connected.

417
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,446
Fellow travelers

418
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:08,881
I'm supposed be on my way.

419
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:12,181
Oh, sure. I mean,
you could totally do that.

420
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:15,789
Totally could.
But, here's what I'm thinking.

421
00:34:15,824 --> 00:34:21,498
I'll make us some dinner. Okay. A couple of
these and then first thing tomorrow, Heathrow.

422
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:28,769
Yeah, that's really nice,
but I'm going to Chicago.

423
00:34:28,804 --> 00:34:31,904
Okay. Well then,
how about Des Moines?

424
00:34:32,709 --> 00:34:34,346
That's still a long way.

425
00:34:35,811 --> 00:34:38,911
What? No one knows you're here.

426
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:41,485
You could take one night to rest.
It'll be fun.

427
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,883
- Uh.
- Come on.

428
00:34:45,887 --> 00:34:47,216
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

429
00:34:48,626 --> 00:34:49,493
Okay.

430
00:35:01,441 --> 00:35:05,102
I mean, it don't...
don't hurt now, I guess.

431
00:35:45,441 --> 00:35:48,046
It is believed that a portion
of the dead pharaoh's spirit

432
00:35:48,081 --> 00:35:50,488
was left behind after death.

433
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:54,723
That portion is called the Ka,
which is ridiculous,

434
00:35:54,758 --> 00:35:57,660
because when you're dead,
you're gone.

435
00:35:57,695 --> 00:36:02,423
It's also believed, wrongly that
that spirit needed proper care.

436
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:05,030
So that the dead Pharaoh
could continue his rule

437
00:36:05,065 --> 00:36:07,362
over the dead in the afterlife.

438
00:36:09,465 --> 00:36:10,640
Afterlife...

439
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,481
All this.

440
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:22,883
When really, the only
afterlife is,

441
00:36:22,918 --> 00:36:24,687
is those of us
who are left behind.

442
00:36:26,955 --> 00:36:29,494
When really, the only

443
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:32,354
afterlife is,

444
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:43,200
Good job today. You can go now
and finals are next week.

445
00:37:00,516 --> 00:37:02,384
I love you.

446
00:37:03,926 --> 00:37:05,497
I love you too, man,

447
00:37:07,831 --> 00:37:09,457
I said I love juice.

448
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:12,702
Yeah, me too, man.

449
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,814
Well, the keys are missing.

450
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:31,589
So, I walk into the bar and there's
this guy dancing like a weirdo.

451
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:36,990
And then he looks at me directly into
my eyes and he runs out of the place.

452
00:37:37,025 --> 00:37:38,486
I mean, that's weird, right?

453
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:41,027
- Even for this town,
- Sounds like Ted.

454
00:37:41,062 --> 00:37:42,567
You hear what I said?
The keys are missing.

455
00:37:42,602 --> 00:37:45,636
Dingus here forgets the plates
to the getaway car.

456
00:37:45,671 --> 00:37:47,704
- I'm really sorry about that.
- Hey, the forms.

457
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:51,906
- Best two or three.
- Winner takes all, one go.

458
00:37:51,941 --> 00:37:53,369
- Go, game, four.
- Yes.

459
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:54,337
Damn it.

460
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,240
I got some forms for you guys
to fill out.

461
00:37:56,275 --> 00:37:58,110
The keys are missing.

462
00:37:58,145 --> 00:37:59,716
Fill em out your own damn self.

463
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:09,561
So, why all the way to Chicago?

464
00:38:11,554 --> 00:38:17,602
Well, when I was a grad student, I studied
anthropology, and we loved going to the field museum.

465
00:38:19,595 --> 00:38:23,333
Our favorite thing to do was to go
to this exhibit on ancient Egypt.

466
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:26,204
- We'd go all the time.
- We never made it there.

467
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:29,174
Oh, you should...
It's beautiful.

468
00:38:30,111 --> 00:38:34,476
Yeah, they have
these machines there.

469
00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:37,919
I don't know if they have them
anymore, but they did.

470
00:38:37,954 --> 00:38:40,086
The Mold-o-Rama.

471
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:43,452
It's this plastic injection
molded figurine

472
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:47,456
for dinosaurs,
and we just loved them.

473
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:53,066
So, yeah, I'm going there
to scatter her.

474
00:38:55,774 --> 00:38:58,203
- Her ashes at the museum?
- Mhm.

475
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,603
They probably don't let you
scatter ashes at the museum.

476
00:39:02,638 --> 00:39:08,312
- I mean, probably not.
- Yeah, I know, probably not.

477
00:39:10,052 --> 00:39:12,349
I guess I'm not really sure
what I'm doing.

478
00:39:13,891 --> 00:39:18,256
Yeah, I bet. What with you being
new to crime and all that.

479
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,326
- I normally don't do this.
- Do what?

480
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:29,399
This, or anything, I guess.

481
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:26,555
We used to build statues,
to heroism and victory and death.

482
00:40:27,965 --> 00:40:30,702
It's so romantic,
don't you think?

483
00:40:33,872 --> 00:40:35,707
Yes, beautiful.

484
00:40:36,842 --> 00:40:38,600
And everlasting.

485
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,714
Death used to be so audacious.

486
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:48,214
Nothing says, "I was here,"
like a monument.

487
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:49,578
Yeah, but where would you
put it?

488
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:54,220
Just the idea of it, you know.

489
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:56,728
If you can't make a statement
with your death, then

490
00:40:57,995 --> 00:40:59,324
what did your life mean?

491
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:01,832
Wait, are you asking me?

492
00:41:03,726 --> 00:41:06,529
No, I'm asking this guy.

493
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:11,402
I'm not sure we can wait
for a response.

494
00:41:12,977 --> 00:41:15,373
Museum is closing.
Let's go home.

495
00:41:15,914 --> 00:41:18,013
Home is nice.

496
00:41:18,048 --> 00:41:21,247
Home is nice.
But, this is nicer.

497
00:41:46,241 --> 00:41:47,504
Amber?

498
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:40,425
What is this?
What are you doing?

499
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,263
- Hey, stop.
- I'm doing this for you, Ted.

500
00:42:43,298 --> 00:42:46,695
You said so yourself.
You need to get over her.

501
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,664
I'm not ready. This isn't right.

502
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:52,668
Nothing needs to change.
And we could all be so happy here.

503
00:42:52,703 --> 00:42:54,109
That's not what she wanted.

504
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:02,986
You have no idea what she wanted

505
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,957
You weren't even with her
when she died.

506
00:43:08,257 --> 00:43:11,126
I held Sam's hand as he left me.

507
00:43:12,998 --> 00:43:16,967
You're feeling guilty 'cause
you weren't there for her.

508
00:43:23,272 --> 00:43:26,075
You could stay here with me.

509
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:35,447
Maybe, she's right.

510
00:43:37,253 --> 00:43:39,715
No, it can't be here.

511
00:43:41,521 --> 00:43:44,489
This is not right.

512
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:48,900
I have to keep going.

513
00:44:42,912 --> 00:44:46,551
Hot. Diggity. Dog.

514
00:44:50,326 --> 00:44:51,622
Oh shit.

515
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,329
Need a ride?

516
00:44:55,364 --> 00:44:57,595
No, thanks. I'm just gonna...

517
00:45:38,033 --> 00:45:40,407
Laura told me all about you,
Teddy boy.

518
00:45:40,442 --> 00:45:43,278
- Oh, yeah, Tracy?
- Don't call me that.

519
00:45:49,517 --> 00:45:53,156
Why don't you get together with Crystal?
You two are perfectly made for each other.

520
00:45:53,191 --> 00:45:57,127
- Don't change the subject.
- I'm not. It's perfectly on topic.

521
00:45:57,162 --> 00:46:00,955
- I'm not going to let you trick me.
- I'm not trying to trick you.

522
00:46:02,057 --> 00:46:03,595
I want you to be happy.

523
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:06,928
How dumb do you think I am?

524
00:46:06,963 --> 00:46:09,766
I'm assuming that's
a rhetorical question.

525
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:25,045
If Laura talked about us so much
you'd know how important Chicago is.

526
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,488
She talked about how you
couldn't handle getting fired...

527
00:46:28,523 --> 00:46:33,559
from your cush teaching gig,
melted down, moved to Colorado.

528
00:46:34,562 --> 00:46:37,761
Her family loves me, not you.

529
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:41,105
Because all you do is
screw things up.

530
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:44,768
You know what? I don't even
care about her ashes anymore.

531
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:49,036
I'm just here to beat you
because Laura deserved better.

532
00:46:49,071 --> 00:46:50,741
God damn it, Tracy,

533
00:46:51,447 --> 00:46:53,007
Oh, shit.

534
00:48:24,243 --> 00:48:28,245
Hi. I think I got lost.

535
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:35,945
Uh... is that the highway?

536
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:40,851
Highway was moved... years ago.

537
00:48:40,886 --> 00:48:44,019
It's 15 minutes' walk now
or 4 if you drive.

538
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:47,297
- That way?
- That way.

539
00:48:47,332 --> 00:48:49,695
No, no, it's that way.

540
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:54,029
- Wasn't that where Fox's is?
- No, that's that way.

541
00:48:54,471 --> 00:48:56,867
Oh. Uh, yeah.

542
00:48:58,002 --> 00:48:59,837
Wh... Where's Des Moines?

543
00:48:59,872 --> 00:49:01,069
- That way.
- This way.

544
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:06,976
- So east is...
- That's west.

545
00:49:09,244 --> 00:49:10,650
So, I need to go...

546
00:49:10,685 --> 00:49:12,256
Has it always
been that way?

547
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:14,357
That's why they put
the highway over there.

548
00:49:14,392 --> 00:49:15,853
Huh.

549
00:49:15,888 --> 00:49:19,824
This area is a puzzle.

550
00:49:40,616 --> 00:49:42,913
- Is it you?
- It is.

551
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,718
You're not... You're not dead?

552
00:49:45,753 --> 00:49:49,755
Uh, no, Ted,
but you got beat up again.

553
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:51,218
Am I dreaming?

554
00:49:51,253 --> 00:49:53,858
You're not dreaming.
Me, yes, dead.

555
00:49:55,191 --> 00:49:57,895
What are you? Are you...
Are you like a ghost or something?

556
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:00,766
Wow. That's like asking a fish,
"How's the water?"

557
00:50:00,801 --> 00:50:02,163
Huh?

558
00:50:02,198 --> 00:50:05,232
- Well, fish doesn't see water.
- Do we know that?

559
00:50:05,267 --> 00:50:08,378
I don't know the rules, Ted.
I... I don't know how.

560
00:50:08,413 --> 00:50:09,874
How... How doesn't matter?

561
00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:13,482
- Why? Why matters.
- Why are you here? Why are you back?

562
00:50:14,617 --> 00:50:18,817
- I'm not sure. Where am I?
- Nebraska.

563
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:21,325
No, we're, uh, in Iowa.

564
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,053
You know what,
I'm not 100% on that either.

565
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:27,221
But where am I? Like, me.

566
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:30,125
Lost.

567
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,898
Well, partner, I guess I'm here
to help you get me back.

568
00:50:36,606 --> 00:50:38,265
You need to hail this car.

569
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,674
Hey, this car, right now.
Stick your hand up.

570
00:50:40,709 --> 00:50:44,579
- Come on. They can't see me.
- Oh, I missed you so much.

571
00:50:44,614 --> 00:50:47,648
- They can't see me.
- Oh.

572
00:50:47,683 --> 00:50:49,144
That was our ride.

573
00:50:52,787 --> 00:50:53,951
Come on.

574
00:50:56,857 --> 00:50:58,956
Hello. Thank you for stopping.

575
00:50:58,991 --> 00:51:00,397
- Where you headed?
- Uh...

576
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,191
Whoa, man.
What happened to your face?

577
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,325
- Cool.
- You should see the other guy?

578
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,537
- Hey, shut up!
- They can't see me.

579
00:51:10,266 --> 00:51:13,806
- I see that.
- So, you headed west?

580
00:51:13,841 --> 00:51:15,742
- Where are we headed?
- West.

581
00:51:15,777 --> 00:51:17,238
And remember,
no one else can see me.

582
00:51:17,273 --> 00:51:18,976
But, wait, don't we...
We don't want to go east?

583
00:51:19,011 --> 00:51:21,143
I do not think
Howl would go east.

584
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:22,815
Plus, we need to be sensitive
to the fact that

585
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:24,421
- no one else can see me.
- No one else can see you.

586
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:29,459
- Right. Um... West is best.
- Great.

587
00:51:29,494 --> 00:51:30,955
Huh.

588
00:51:33,894 --> 00:51:35,322
So, what happened?

589
00:51:35,357 --> 00:51:38,567
Uh... I got into a fight

You lost our special quarter.

631
00:53:34,916 --> 00:53:38,478
This crazy lady stole it from me
and made me do this crazy dance.

632
00:53:38,513 --> 00:53:41,448
Oh. I don't know
what to think about that.

633
00:53:41,483 --> 00:53:44,693
Things have just been really
weird since I've seen you last.

634
00:53:47,192 --> 00:53:49,423
- That's stealing.
- Is it?

635
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:54,901
Hey, I've been
so lost without you.

636
00:53:54,936 --> 00:53:58,399
You were pretty lost with me.

637
00:53:58,434 --> 00:54:01,501
What are we...
What are we even doing here?

638
00:54:01,536 --> 00:54:02,744
Shopping.

639
00:54:02,779 --> 00:54:05,978
Okay. Can we just slow down?
Can we just stop for a second.

640
00:54:06,013 --> 00:54:07,914
I... I never thought that
I would see you again,

641
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:09,619
and now, I see you again.

642
00:54:09,654 --> 00:54:13,953
And... I just want to tell you
that I'm sorry.

643
00:54:13,988 --> 00:54:16,725
I appreciate the need
to unburden your soul,

644
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,563
but it feels like, again,
that's become my problem.

645
00:54:19,598 --> 00:54:21,488
And now I'm stuck
in this weird limbo,

646
00:54:21,523 --> 00:54:24,095
and I'm only here because you couldn't
figure out what to do with my ashes.

647
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:26,669
And... And now I'm lost.
Or my ashes are anyway.

648
00:54:26,704 --> 00:54:28,495
And my whole family
wants you arrested.

649
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:31,267
Oh, um, I'm sorry
about that, too, right now.

650
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:34,270
I can't do anything
with sorry. Action, Ted!

651
00:54:35,845 --> 00:54:37,141
Okay.

652
00:54:38,683 --> 00:54:41,046
Uh... action.

653
00:54:41,081 --> 00:54:43,048
Uh, so, what?
What do you want me to do?

654
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:45,116
- Pick one of these.
- I pick that one.

655
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:50,286
What's going on
with this ensemble?

656
00:54:50,321 --> 00:54:51,661
Oh, yeah, the crazy lady.

657
00:54:51,696 --> 00:54:54,224
This is her... This is her
dead husband's clothes.

658
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:59,163
I told you,
things have been really weird.

659
00:54:59,198 --> 00:55:03,134
Are you sure you're not a figment of my
imagination or a projection of something?

660
00:55:03,169 --> 00:55:05,741
I don't feel like
a figment of your imagination?

661
00:55:05,776 --> 00:55:07,039
I feel real.

662
00:55:07,074 --> 00:55:08,909
I mean, as real
as a ghost can be.

663
00:55:08,944 --> 00:55:11,373
A ghost that
only you can see. No.

664
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:14,541
- How do you know?
- Do you know where my ashes are?

665
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:17,654
Howl has 'em.
It's the best I got.

666
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,447
So that proves it.

667
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,152
Because there are things I know,
like what we have to do

668
00:55:21,187 --> 00:55:24,320
to get my ashes back, so I can't
be a figment of your imagination,

669
00:55:24,355 --> 00:55:27,158
because that would be
impossible. That's nice.

670
00:55:27,193 --> 00:55:28,357
But...
Yeah, that would be

671
00:55:28,392 --> 00:55:30,667
the most impossiblest part
of this situation.

672
00:55:32,297 --> 00:55:35,166
Also buy the lighter.
It's the last thing, I promise.

673
00:55:35,806 --> 00:55:37,300
Fine.

674
00:55:37,335 --> 00:55:41,139
And also,
buying this bouncy ball.

675
00:55:41,174 --> 00:55:43,680
- Why?
- Out of spite.

676
00:55:46,245 --> 00:55:47,882
He does that all the time.

677
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:50,720
There's an abandoned drive-in movie
theater three miles down the road.

678
00:55:50,755 --> 00:55:52,579
You need to get them
to stop there for the night.

679
00:55:52,614 --> 00:55:56,220
- Uh, please fill me in here.
- You said you would trust me.

680
00:55:56,255 --> 00:55:58,585
There's an abandoned movie
theater about three miles up the road.

681
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,125
I think we should
stop there for the night.

682
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,292
Oh, my God.
Are you going to kill us?

683
00:56:02,327 --> 00:56:05,064
- Am I supposed to murder them?
- Unfortunately, no.

684
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:07,363
Classic. Murdered by
a hitchhiker.

685
00:56:07,398 --> 00:56:09,629
- Cool.
- No, no murdering.

686
00:56:09,664 --> 00:56:11,939

734
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,536
So, what do we do now?

735
01:00:40,473 --> 01:00:42,946
Now you make
a decoy of the ashes.

736
01:00:44,576 --> 01:00:46,378
That's why you had me
buy that stuff.

737
01:00:46,413 --> 01:00:49,117
- Yes.
- Why didn't you just tell me that?

738
01:00:49,152 --> 01:00:50,151
I don't know.

739
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:59,424
Our last morning together,
you said you wanted the gods to intervene.

740
01:00:59,459 --> 01:01:01,789
Perhaps I shouldn't have
tempted fate.

741
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,824
Do you think that
we would have figured it out?

742
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,497
If we had tried, maybe.

743
01:01:06,532 --> 01:01:08,499
- Were you gonna to try?
- Yes.

744
01:01:08,534 --> 01:01:12,668
I just... I some...
I let dumb shit get in the way sometimes.

745
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:15,803
Would you have ever scattered me
if Howl hadn't stolen them?

746
01:01:16,608 --> 01:01:18,938
Yeah, wh... When you died,

747
01:01:18,973 --> 01:01:21,248
I just wanted everything
to stay the same.

748
01:01:21,283 --> 01:01:22,645
I wanted to have
the same breakfast,

749
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,911
the same lunch, the same dinner,

750
01:01:24,946 --> 01:01:27,518
and there's a part of me
that still does.

751
01:01:28,521 --> 01:01:30,994
I'm worried that
if I say good bye to you,

752
01:01:31,029 --> 01:01:34,129
and if I actually
let you go, then...

753
01:01:34,164 --> 01:01:36,560
there's not going to be
anything left of me either.

754
01:01:38,201 --> 01:01:40,795
I'm so alone and I'm miserable.

755
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:41,862
Oh, good.

756
01:01:42,634 --> 01:01:45,140
- What?
- He's going to breakfast

757
01:01:53,645 --> 01:01:57,119
- Oh... good.
- Come on.

758
01:01:57,154 --> 01:01:58,120
Oh...

759
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,486
Hey, did you
know that all along?

760
01:02:18,032 --> 01:02:18,998
Crap!

761
01:02:19,033 --> 01:02:20,439
How do we get in?

762
01:02:20,474 --> 01:02:21,671
Just try the handle.

763
01:02:22,542 --> 01:02:23,937
Do you have magic?

764
01:02:23,972 --> 01:02:25,213
What are you
talking about?

765
01:02:25,248 --> 01:02:26,280
What are you
talking about?

766
01:02:26,315 --> 01:02:27,611
This is basic
motel security.

767
01:02:27,646 --> 01:02:30,548
The doors lock
on their own. See!

768
01:02:32,783 --> 01:02:34,684
Howl has a weird
relationship with locks.

769
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:46,987
<i>We got to go.</i>

770
01:03:48,529 --> 01:03:50,463
Ted, Howl's parking.

771
01:03:50,498 --> 01:03:51,431
Wait. Wait.

772
01:03:52,533 --> 01:03:54,830
So... this is it?

773
01:03:58,506 --> 01:03:59,901
I love you.

774
01:04:03,313 --> 01:04:04,873
Go out the window.

775
01:04:06,646 --> 01:04:07,777
Okay.

776
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,113
- Yeah?
<i>- You ready to go?</i>

777
01:04:47,148 --> 01:04:48,389
I'll leave in like,
ten minutes.

778
01:04:49,084 --> 01:04:50,490
<i>Did you already get breakfast?</i>

779
01:04:50,525 --> 01:04:51,557
Yeah.

780
01:04:51,592 --> 01:04:53,757
<i>Wow.
Thanks for the invite.</i>

781
01:04:53,792 --> 01:04:55,990
- Okay. Bye.
- <i>You know, I'm hungry...</i>

782
01:05:21,754 --> 01:05:23,919
Uh, it's incredibly lucky.

783
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:39,506
Look!

784
01:06:16,776 --> 01:06:19,007
I'm gonna wait you out,
teddy boy.

785
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:21,174
Yeah, well, I have
all the time in the world

786
01:06:22,782 --> 01:06:25,717
You got ten minutes
before you run out of gas.

787
01:06:36,862 --> 01:06:39,093
You win, Howl.

788
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:41,403
Can we just
end this. Please?

789
01:06:41,438 --> 01:06:42,602
Right here.

790
01:06:42,637 --> 01:06:43,669
Right now.

791
01:06:43,704 --> 01:06:45,341
Teddy, Come on.

792
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:51,039
I am faster, stronger,
better than you.

793
01:07:14,768 --> 01:07:15,899
What?

794
01:07:16,572 --> 01:07:17,538
I need a ride.

795
01:07:18,475 --> 01:07:19,408
Is there a problem?

796
01:07:19,443 --> 01:07:20,673
Says, he needs a ride.

797
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:21,872
- Where?
- How?

798
01:07:21,907 --> 01:07:23,236
We got what we came for.

799
01:07:23,271 --> 01:07:24,941
Did Ted steal
your truck again?

800
01:07:24,976 --> 01:07:26,041
You're such a
pain in the ass.

801
01:07:26,076 --> 01:07:27,207
Will you just
give me the ride?

802
01:07:27,242 --> 01:07:28,846
Did he steal
the ashes too?

803
01:07:28,881 --> 01:07:29,913
No, I have them
right here.

804
01:07:29,948 --> 01:07:31,079
Ok, I don't understand.

805
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:32,784
So, he took your truck,
but not the ashes?

806
01:07:32,819 --> 01:07:33,917
Yeah, that's
right, Crystal.

807
01:07:33,952 --> 01:07:35,116
Yeah, That doesn't
make any sense.

808
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:36,788
Well, maybe he gave up.

809
01:07:36,823 --> 01:07:38,625
Crystal will drive you.

810
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:41,463
Momma! I am... No...

811
01:07:44,501 --> 01:07:47,964
When you get to the
border... Illinois,

812
01:07:47,999 --> 01:07:52,507
you have to choose
between I88 and 80.

813
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:54,740
Take 80.

814
01:07:54,775 --> 01:07:56,236
You'll be thanking me later.

815
01:07:56,271 --> 01:07:57,138
Yes, sir.

816
01:07:57,173 --> 01:08:00,746
You are the
most loyal, true,

817
01:08:00,781 --> 01:08:03,716
faithful, committed
guy I've known.

818
01:08:03,751 --> 01:08:05,014
Thank you, Momma.

819
01:08:05,049 --> 01:08:06,521
All right.
Can we go now?

820
01:08:12,991 --> 01:08:15,321
Can I tell you
something?

821
01:08:15,356 --> 01:08:17,532
The ashes you gave
to Momma were a decoy.

822
01:08:19,833 --> 01:08:21,096
It's obvious.

823
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:22,636
It wasn't to your Momma.

824
01:08:23,672 --> 01:08:24,935
She can't find out.

825
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:26,475
Tell me why and
I won't say anything.

826
01:08:30,877 --> 01:08:33,680
Look, it's more
of a ritual...

827
01:08:33,715 --> 01:08:35,715
...to them than
anything else.

828
01:08:37,521 --> 01:08:40,049
And what they don't know
can't hurt them.

829
01:08:41,888 --> 01:08:43,525
So...

830
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,153
I can't lose to him.

831
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:47,155
Ted?

832
01:08:48,389 --> 01:08:49,289
You kidding me?

833
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:51,896
No.

834
01:08:51,931 --> 01:08:52,996
So what's your plan
when you get there?

835
01:08:53,031 --> 01:08:54,096
Catch him.

836
01:08:54,703 --> 01:08:55,801
You know.

837
01:08:55,836 --> 01:08:57,231
Beat him up, get my
car back, go home.

838
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:58,870
Has beating him up
worked for you so far?

839
01:08:58,905 --> 01:09:01,169
- Yes.
- He's outsmarted you every time.

840
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:04,579
You gotta have
fox to fox.

841
01:09:06,077 --> 01:09:09,276
You have to beat him
at his own game, Howl.

842
01:09:17,693 --> 01:09:19,627
So we're about two hours.

843
01:09:19,662 --> 01:09:21,288
Plus traffic.

844
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:23,191
Plus Chicago traffic,
four hours.

845
01:09:24,161 --> 01:09:25,226
But we're close.

846
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:27,470
We're really close.

847
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:32,475
Jesus Christ!

848
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:34,576
You scared the
shit out of me.

849
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:37,238
What?

850
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:39,207
What are you doing back?

851
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,283
Ted.

852
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:52,088
Did you lose
my ashes again?

853
01:09:52,123 --> 01:09:55,190
No, no, look,
you're right here.

854
01:09:55,225 --> 01:09:57,291
I did everything that
you told me to do.

855
01:09:58,129 --> 01:09:59,326
Where are we?

856
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:02,164
We're in Illinois.
Right here.

857
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:05,871
Which is like two, well,
four hours to Chicago.

858
01:10:05,906 --> 01:10:07,136
Field Museum.

859
01:10:07,171 --> 01:10:08,643
Right.

860
01:10:08,678 --> 01:10:11,646
I'm gonna... I'm gonna scatter
you where we were the happiest.

861
01:10:15,146 --> 01:10:16,409
Why am I back?

862
01:10:17,852 --> 01:10:18,851
I don't know.

863
01:10:23,924 --> 01:10:25,352
I can't do this anymore.

864
01:10:27,488 --> 01:10:29,158
What... Then...

865
01:10:29,765 --> 01:10:30,698
Let's get going.

866
01:10:31,833 --> 01:10:32,700
Great.

867
01:10:34,066 --> 01:10:35,131
Okay.

868
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:16,546
Do you know what
sacred means?

869
01:11:17,208 --> 01:11:18,647
<i>Special?</i>

870
01:11:18,682 --> 01:11:20,374
Special?

871
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:26,688
Sacrosanct, to be venerated,
inviolable, untouchable.

872
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:31,792
What prompted you to disturb
that which is more special?

873
01:11:33,961 --> 01:11:36,632
It was an accident.

874
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:37,600
Give it.

875
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:44,640
You are banned from
the field museum for life.

876
01:11:53,277 --> 01:11:54,617
You believe this crap.

877
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:31,247
This is it.

878
01:12:32,954 --> 01:12:34,316
Ted.

879
01:12:35,792 --> 01:12:36,923
Mr. Daniels.

880
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:38,419
Huh?

881
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:40,828
I am Steven Lesca.
The head of security here.

882
01:12:40,863 --> 01:12:42,192
I just met your friend Howl.

883
01:12:42,227 --> 01:12:43,699
What? No!

884
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:45,932
- It's not even his real name.
- That's not even his real name.

885
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:47,164
Sorry.

886
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:48,869
Howl. It's a
stupid nickname.

887
01:12:48,904 --> 01:12:49,870
His real name's Tracy.

888
01:12:50,873 --> 01:12:52,334
Always better, I suppose.

889
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:54,039
Yeah, and he's
not my friend.

890
01:12:54,074 --> 01:12:55,304
I'm sorry about that.

891
01:12:56,373 --> 01:12:57,911
What brings you
to the Field today?

892
01:12:59,145 --> 01:13:00,045
The art.

893
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,046
The... The art.

894
01:13:01,081 --> 01:13:02,575
- The art?
- The art.

895
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:03,312
The art.

896
01:13:03,347 --> 01:13:05,050
- Art.
- Really? Art?

897
01:13:05,085 --> 01:13:08,020
I'm here to admire
and observe the art.

898
01:13:08,055 --> 01:13:09,791
That's not what
Howl told us.

899
01:13:09,826 --> 01:13:14,422
Yeah, well, his
name's a verb, so...

900
01:13:20,738 --> 01:13:24,168
Nothing happens in this
museum that I cannot see.

901
01:13:24,203 --> 01:13:26,632
And I'm looking at
your face right now.

902
01:13:26,667 --> 01:13:28,711
Am I doing something
weird with my face?

903
01:13:28,746 --> 01:13:29,943
- Yeah.
- Yes.

904
01:13:29,978 --> 01:13:32,044
Look, it's a touching story

905
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:33,474
and I know you've
come a long way.

906
01:13:34,378 --> 01:13:35,509
Don't do it

907
01:13:38,283 --> 01:13:40,921
All right. It's all set.

908
01:13:42,188 --> 01:13:44,617
Thanks for the ride.
And you know the advice.

909
01:13:46,192 --> 01:13:48,126
Sure you don't need
me to stick around?

910
01:13:48,161 --> 01:13:50,832
Nah, all I need
are my keys back.

911
01:13:50,867 --> 01:13:54,033
You know, beat him up.
Should be a cinch.

912
01:14:12,317 --> 01:14:13,448
What happened?

913
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:16,451
Can you see anything?

914
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:17,760
Ted.

915
01:14:18,389 --> 01:14:20,862
I'm not magical.

916
01:14:22,393 --> 01:14:23,898
Howl is here.

917
01:14:23,933 --> 01:14:25,097
Oh, you're not magical, huh?

918
01:14:26,001 --> 01:14:26,967
Then how can you tell if...

919
01:14:27,002 --> 01:14:27,968
Hey, Loser.

920
01:14:28,872 --> 01:14:30,267
Where's my truck?

921
01:14:30,302 --> 01:14:31,565
Hey, what's your deal, man?

922
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,468
I just wanted to see
the look on your face

923
01:14:33,503 --> 01:14:36,339
when you realised
I beat you.

924
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:42,081
Worth it. Totally worth it.

925
01:14:43,282 --> 01:14:44,787
I out foxed the fox.

926
01:14:44,822 --> 01:14:45,612
You are the fox.

927
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:47,416
Yeah. And what
does that make you?

928
01:14:47,451 --> 01:14:49,121
A better fox.

929
01:14:49,156 --> 01:14:51,651
Give me my truck
back and we're even.

930
01:14:51,686 --> 01:14:54,489
You have an unbelievably
screwed up concept of even.

931
01:14:54,524 --> 01:14:57,690
Your monument was a joke.

932
01:14:57,725 --> 01:15:00,429
Didn't she say you couldn't
stand for what you believe in?

933
01:15:00,464 --> 01:15:02,629
Came all the way to
Chicago for what?

934
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:03,597
Nothing.

935
01:15:15,578 --> 01:15:20,020
Wow, no one crosses
Ted Daniels, I guess.

936
01:15:20,055 --> 01:15:22,121
Hey, don't make fun.

937
01:15:22,156 --> 01:15:23,419
I feel bad enough as it is.

938
01:15:23,454 --> 01:15:26,389
Oh, well, if it makes
you feel any better,

939
01:15:26,424 --> 01:15:28,996
I think that the bouncy
ball did most of the work.

940
01:15:42,011 --> 01:15:43,571
The path is clear now.

941
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,706
We just have to...

942
01:15:46,741 --> 01:15:50,413
...outsmart the impenetrable
security at the Field Museum.

943
01:15:51,152 --> 01:15:53,053
No one crosses
Ted Daniels.

944
01:15:55,189 --> 01:15:58,157
We know their security
cameras everywhere, right?

945
01:15:59,556 --> 01:16:01,160
Maybe it's not meant to be.

946
01:16:02,394 --> 01:16:04,427
No, no, it has to be.

947
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:06,198
We've come this far.

948
01:16:10,303 --> 01:16:13,568
No one crosses Ned Taniels.

949
01:16:14,978 --> 01:16:16,670
Who is that?

950
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:19,013
Guy I made up... right now.

951
01:16:20,313 --> 01:16:23,578
Well, whatever you're gonna do,
we should do it fast.

952
01:16:23,613 --> 01:16:25,613
I'm fading pretty quick here.

953
01:17:49,204 --> 01:17:50,665
We could do it here.

954
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:53,206
Yeah.

955
01:17:57,179 --> 01:17:58,211
BUt, we're not going to.

956
01:18:00,578 --> 01:18:02,985
You always knew
where we were happiest.

957
01:18:04,186 --> 01:18:07,319
It was never about tombs,
or gods, or monuments.

958
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:11,092
Happiness for us
was uncomplicated.

959
01:18:12,425 --> 01:18:13,358
Let's go home.

960
01:18:18,497 --> 01:18:19,628
This guy?

961
01:18:20,532 --> 01:18:21,432
I have to go.

962
01:18:21,467 --> 01:18:22,433
No, you need to leave.

963
01:18:22,468 --> 01:18:24,204
Yeah. Look, I'm trying to.

964
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:26,272
Look, you were right.
I was going to scatter her...

965
01:18:26,307 --> 01:18:27,009
Yeah, I knew that.

966
01:18:27,044 --> 01:18:28,241
Yeah, but I'm not going to now.

967
01:18:28,276 --> 01:18:29,176
I know that too.

968
01:18:29,211 --> 01:18:30,870
Because I decided not to.

969
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:32,377
Wait a minute.

970
01:18:33,545 --> 01:18:35,149
So you're leaving?

971
01:18:35,184 --> 01:18:37,085
Yes, if you let me.

972
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:39,054
Thank you.

973
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:40,781
Fine. Wonderful.

974
01:18:40,816 --> 01:18:43,388
Actually, uh, I'm sorry.

975
01:18:44,325 --> 01:18:46,061
Can we do one thing first?

976
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:27,993
Oh!

977
01:19:38,676 --> 01:19:39,807
Now, I'll leave.

978
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,014
Oh, you're awake?

979
01:19:53,427 --> 01:19:54,921
They discharging you soon?

980
01:20:01,061 --> 01:20:01,994
Huh.

981
01:20:02,502 --> 01:20:03,402
You feeling better?

982
01:20:09,344 --> 01:20:11,311
Mmm. Can I get you anything?

983
01:20:11,742 --> 01:20:12,873
You hungry or?

984
01:20:15,548 --> 01:20:17,713
There's a
vending machine right...

985
01:20:18,078 --> 01:20:18,978
Oh, here.

986
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,830
You know, I kind of like
you not being able to talk.

987
01:20:36,767 --> 01:20:38,305
You know, you've been
a real asshole

988
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,834
for a really long time.

989
01:20:39,869 --> 01:20:42,738
I think you do it because you're trying
to protect yourself or something.

990
01:20:42,773 --> 01:20:44,102
And that's okay.

991
01:20:44,137 --> 01:20:49,250
I think somewhere in there
you're a good person.

992
01:20:49,285 --> 01:20:52,121
Just don't be
a prick all the time

993
01:20:57,755 --> 01:21:00,525
I came to let you know I'm
spreading Laura's ashes in Colorado.

994
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,811
Yep.

995
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:34,922
In Egyptian mythology,

996
01:21:35,694 --> 01:21:37,529
when you die,

997
01:21:37,564 --> 01:21:41,368
Anubis weighs your heart
against this feather of truth.

998
01:21:42,668 --> 01:21:44,833
Ideally, you know your heart,

999
01:21:44,868 --> 01:21:46,472
you kind of want, even.

1000
01:21:46,507 --> 01:21:48,606
Because if it's too heavy,
if it's too light,

1001
01:21:48,641 --> 01:21:52,742
then this terrible monster named Ammit
comes and then he just like, argh...

1002
01:21:52,777 --> 01:21:54,975
He just, like, swallows
your heart and,

1003
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:57,076
pretty much doomed to oblivion.

1004
01:21:58,112 --> 01:22:02,554
The idea is, in the end,
you want to be even.

1005
01:22:03,887 --> 01:22:06,822
And evenness allows you
to pass to the underworld.

1006
01:22:15,602 --> 01:22:19,197
Well, because
if we die tomorrow,

1007
01:22:19,232 --> 01:22:22,310
I wouldn't want to know
that we weren't even.

1008
01:22:24,446 --> 01:22:25,478
Why are we doing this?

1009
01:22:25,513 --> 01:22:26,611
I just want to be even.

1010
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:43,298
No, it's not a trick.

1011
01:22:44,631 --> 01:22:48,633
But, I do want to steal that
truck of yours one more time.

1012
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:14,141
<i>This is where
we were happiest.</i>

1013
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:18,486
<i>When we were doing
absolutely nothing.</i>

1014
01:25:20,853 --> 01:25:24,426
I'm sorry that I had to drive
cross country to realize that.

1015
01:25:25,891 --> 01:25:27,561
You just like
to get into trouble.

1016
01:25:27,596 --> 01:25:29,387
Yeah.

1017
01:25:29,422 --> 01:25:31,499
Because I know that
you won't give me out.

1018
01:25:33,327 --> 01:25:34,260
Yeah.

1019
01:25:40,037 --> 01:25:41,542
What am I going to do
without you?

1020
01:25:42,677 --> 01:25:43,610
You're going to be all right.

1021
01:25:50,619 --> 01:25:51,981
Yeah.

1022
01:25:52,016 --> 01:25:53,653
Yeah, yeah, I will.

1023
01:25:57,692 --> 01:25:59,527
I loved every moment with you.

1024
01:26:01,421 --> 01:26:04,829
I loved being able to be
your partner.

1025
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:08,470
I love that you
let me be your partner.

1026
01:26:12,674 --> 01:26:14,300
I love you, so much.

1027
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:16,808
I love you, too.

1028
01:26:23,586 --> 01:26:24,486
Goodbye, Laura.
