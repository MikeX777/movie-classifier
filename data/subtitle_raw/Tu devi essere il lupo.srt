1
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,752
Why did you call us, Owl?

2
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,678
Bear has gone missing.

3
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,877
That wolf again! Darn him!

4
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,514
Who else could it be?

5
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,349
How can you be so sure?

6
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,714
Whoever enters the woods is lost.
It's all the wolf is waiting for.

7
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,199
Bear talked about that
too much lately.

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,233
But are you sure he met the wolf?

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,672
Stop this! You know
you must never go into the woods.

10
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,395
The path is obstructed
and it leads nowhere.

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,229
That's what Bear said too.

12
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,715
Nothing grows
at the foot of a volcano

13
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,629
and one day we'll end up
covered in lava.

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,875
We've lived here for centuries

15
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,117
and nothing bad
has ever happened to us.

16
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,991
YOU MUST BE THE WOLF

17
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,635
Valentina?

18
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,035
Valentina?

19
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,639
<Valentina is speaking,>
<I'm not home, leave a message. >

20
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,832
<Hello, Valentina,>
<where have you got to?>

21
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,678
I'm waiting for you at our flat.

22
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,517
You forgot.

23
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,958
You left your bag
and cell phone here.

24
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,278
Listen.

25
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,835
<I brought you something. >

26
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,672
<Now it looks like a home>
<where human beings live. >

27
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,992
All right, I'll pass by your place.

28
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,715
The fish are beautiful!

29
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,711
Outline number three.

30
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,469
The poet Thomas Elliot
wrote these verses:

31
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,319
"Time present and time past

32
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,353
are maybe both present
in time future

33
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,075
and time future is contained
in time past. "

34
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,078
I would like you to reflect
on this theme: time and us.

35
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,354
Tell me about your childhood,
your relationship with your parents

36
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,835
and with your brothers and sisters
if you have any.

37
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,395
I'd like to know what you remember

38
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,559
and what you don't remember
but have imagined.

39
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,070
You have three hours
to hand in your essays.

40
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,315
Good luck.

41
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,150
<All children go to sleep,>

42
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,071
<but Vale does not. >

43
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,229
I don't know what's wrong,
it cut out and won't start again.

44
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,510
Easy. You're lucky I'm here.

45
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,588
- You're not from around here?
- No.

46
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,511
I've just moved here.

47
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,154
- Moved here?
- Yes, I lived in Milan.

48
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,270
You mean you'll be a taxi driver for
life in the land of the living dead?

49
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,951
How long did it take
to think up that brilliant move?

50
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,959
- I was left a house.
- Lucky you!

51
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,310
How did your wife take it?

52
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,554
- Where to?
- Via Maffei, 13.

53
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,196
"Listen to me!" said the Tiger.

54
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,675
"Yes, boss!" replied the young man.

55
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,879
Then they walked up the hills
and came to the woods.

56
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,719
"Be careful!" said Kammamuri
to the Portuguese man.

57
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,118
"I saw many snakes this morning
and I saw tiger prints too. "

58
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,073
"It must be tonight",
Sandokan had said.

59
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,838
Seal!

60
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,234
- Look!
- Get it in focus.

61
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,473
What about that lady there?

62
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,269
- Will she do for me?
- No.

63
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,953
Move over there!

64
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,039
You rascal!

65
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,476
Where are you?

66
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,870
Soldier, take off the blindfold!
Open your eyes.

67
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,073
Valentina Arvigo:
tonsils and adenoids.

68
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,839
- Are you the father?
- Yes.

69
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,076
- Arvigo...?
- Oarlo.

70
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,996
Sign here for me please.

71
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,550
Look, Dad,
Lulu's fur is shabby.

72
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,632
She's grown old by now.

73
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,951
How old is she?

74
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,630
She's six years old.

75
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,272
Just like you.

76
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,073
I'm old too then.

77
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,639
Six years for a bear
are like sixty for a little girl.

78
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,472
Daddy,

79
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,793
do you think Mom can see us now?

80
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,393
I don't know.

81
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,350
Do you miss her?

82
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,799
A little.

83
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,188
Vale!

84
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,712
Are you coming tonight?

85
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,593
The guys from
the 4th year have a car.

86
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,634
- Where are you going?
- To the "Jolly Frog", so is Mirko.

87
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,671
Shit. Tonight of all nights?

88
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,475
I've already told him
to save you a place in the car.

89
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,517
But I can't tonight,
I'm watching a film with Oarlo.

90
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,836
What are you watching this time?

91
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,873
I don't know, he gets to choose.

92
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,269
Tough for you, I feel
I'll start dating Mirko tonight.

93
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,511
And you're abandoning me right now?

94
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,948
Well?

95
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,995
I'm sorry, but Oarlo and I
need some time on our own.

96
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,236
Don't worry, I'm not going to watch
a 1930s Bulgarian film.

97
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,670
Just stop it, you two!

98
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,194
Wake up!

99
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,074
It's time.

100
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,793
Liar!

101
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,150
It's the middle of the night.

102
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,311
10:28 a. m.

103
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,558
Yeah, all right.

104
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,359
Oome on, I don't
want Vale to find you here.

105
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,633
Two more minutes
of cuddling, please.

106
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,273
Thank you.

107
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,630
How is your one and only love?

108
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,674
She wants to go to England
for a month this summer.

109
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,473
On her own.

110
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,357
You won't hold out for a month,
you'd both die of a broken heart.

111
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,469
I want to do something tonight.
Are you with me?

112
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,559
- I can't tonight.
- What a pity!

113
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,599
Are you sure?

114
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,076
- I told you, didn't I?
- Yes. Never mind.

115
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,755
- I've already promised...
- I know, your girlfriend.

116
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,994
When you decide to ditch me,
will you give me some notice?

117
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,430
Yes. Eight days from today.

118
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,354
I want 12 years and 2 months.

119
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,233
I didn't know the taxi driver
union was so powerful!

120
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,354
What will it say
to prevent the trip to England?

121
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,269
The trade union's tough
with girlfriends, not with daughters.

122
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,233
With bedmates, not girlfriends.

123
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,477
I'll leave this then we'll go.

124
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,550
<Valentina. It's me, Marcia. >

125
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,150
<They came to pick up>
<the kaleidoscope today,>

126
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,636
<but I told them to come back>
<tomorrow. Have you finished?>

127
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,992
<Give me a call,>
<I feel like having a chat. >

128
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,516
Hello, Adar!

129
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,672
Suzana...

130
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,714
Sorry, Amandio, I didn't know you
were here, or I'd have knocked.

131
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,148
How are you?

132
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,597
What brings you here?

133
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,712
I came to feed Adar.

134
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,751
Why, where's Valentina?

135
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,669
She's left. Didn't you know?

136
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,718
Left? Where to?

137
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:50,153
I don't know, she left her keys with
the concierge. I thought you knew.

138
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,756
Is anything wrong?

139
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,471
Why that face?

140
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,712
I knew it was coming.

141
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,791
How come no school today?

142
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,514
What?

143
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,596
- What's your name?
- Morelli, what's yours?

144
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,354
Oarlo.

145
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,157
It's tough, eh?

146
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,160
- What is?
- Starting work so early.

147
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,158
It is for you too, I see.

148
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,750
- The Italian game?
- American.

149
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,349
You state your number and hole,
leaving 8 for last.

150
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,758
What if they catch you?

151
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,951
- Who?
- Your parents.

152
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,512
They've enough problems
between themselves...

153
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,314
If they catch me,
I'll say I'm traumatized.

154
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,078
Traumatized?

155
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,431
They're breaking up.

156
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,995
- And you don't mind?
- Yes, I do mind.

157
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,838
It was about time.

158
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,836
Good morning.
Via Tonale, the top of the street.

159
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,599
Oalm down, Pito!

160
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,149
Oalm down!

161
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,075
You're becoming a rascal!

162
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,428
The plane, train, now a taxi...
What next?

163
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,589
If I use the image,
can I link it directly?

164
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:50,790
The difference of two powers
of equal positive exponent...

165
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,999
is divisible...

166
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,439
- .. by the sum of the powers.
- No!

167
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,158
- The bases, only...
- If the exponent is equal.

168
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,879
You see. You don't simplify.

169
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,912
How do you simplify 157 by 16?

170
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,589
There must be a calculation error,
that's the procedure.

171
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,756
We've gone wrong somewhere.

172
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,673
Oome on, try again!

173
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,236
I can't stand Battista any more!

174
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,716
He's had his father's garage a year,
but it feels like 30!

175
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,799
You said the same of his old man.
You're never satisfied.

176
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,560
He was an asshole
but he respected our work.

177
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,320
And he also taught me
everything I know.

178
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,671
Whereas thatjerk
just wants us to be fast.

179
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,355
He wastes our time on bullshit.

180
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,835
We have to paint his car
every two weeks.

181
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,268
Refuse to!

182
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,598
That idiot thinks if you work
in the office, you belong to him.

183
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,713
Now he wants us to campaign
for him in the elections!

184
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,038
Guess what he did. You know Mario,
who's worked there for years?

185
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,671
- Sheila's dad?
- He's moved him into the office.

186
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,397
To answer the phone

187
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,353
and write out invoices.

188
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,989
Wasn't he a whiz with lorries?

189
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,272
Battista!

190
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,993
He wants him to retire early.

191
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,829
Have you any credit on your card?
I have to get a film for Vale.

192
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,114
- What will you punish her with now?
- "Sky Over Berlin".

193
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,395
How much do
colour prints cost?

194
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,955
It depends. Prints of what?

195
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,113
Wait, I'll go and get the film.

196
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,399
- Just a sec.
- Oan't you do it tomorrow?

197
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,511
There's only one photo
on focus in it.

198
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,951
I need 1,000 copies of it,
fast and cheap.

199
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,593
- A thousand?
- Yes.

200
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,754
- What do you want 1,000 for?
- Print them, then you'll find out.

201
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,632
You're asking a lot!

202
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,434
Blame it on me if Vale complains.

203
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,438
It is your fault.

204
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,632
What a surprise!

205
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,469
<- Sorry for the irruption. >
- I'm pleased you came.

206
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,831
Is anything wrong?

207
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,593
<No, nothing. >

208
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,197
<If the door were to open,>
<I guess I'd come up. >

209
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,673
Hello.

210
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,429
Oome in.

211
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,473
Sorry I didn't know
there was a party.

212
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,955
Party? Just a few friends, come in!

213
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,874
Oome on!

214
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,119
Wait.

215
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,834
- How are you?
- Fine, but...

216
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,191
Is there some problem with Vale?

217
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,233
- Leaving your guests on their own?
- Let's go.

218
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,874
- What?
<- I think I'm drunk!>

219
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,310
I can't work out what you're saying.

220
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,112
<There's a mess, Mirko's not here. >

221
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,356
- He didn't turn up?
<- He's vanished. >

222
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,313
- What?
<- We need you here!>

223
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,757
Yeah, next time.

224
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,237
<With ice, please. >

225
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,237
Sorry, Gi-o, I have to go now.

226
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,512
<- A Bulgarian film?>
- Yes, Oarlo's waiting for me to go on.

227
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,434
<- Don't have too much fun!>
- Okay.

228
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,710
<- Kiss you. >
- Me too.

229
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,150
<- See you tomorrow. >
- Bye.

230
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,875
Suite 207, the imperial suite.

231
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,589
I saw lightning before.

232
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,397
It's going to rain tomorrow.

233
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,199
I like it.

234
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,837
I like you.

235
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,358
I've had a nice meal prepared
for us in the suite tonight.

236
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,039
Is that so?

237
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,476
What have you ordered?

238
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,713
Lobster, caviar and champagne.

239
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,116
I like you better.

240
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,077
Thank goodness!

241
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,351
<.. and all the relationships... >

242
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,597
<Big question! We'll be back soon... >

243
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,396
<.. these too accompanied>
<by heavy lava flows. >

244
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,435
<These phenomena have never>
<threatened the lives>

245
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,234
<of those living on Etna's slopes. >

246
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,274
<Even if it's occurred>
<with unusual intensity>

247
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,948
<in the volcano's recent history. >

248
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,639
<Vale and Oarlo speaking, we're>
<not home. Leave a message and... >

249
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,114
<Hello?>

250
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,839
Hello?

251
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,878
When spring arrives,
it's hard to resist.

252
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,277
Only the hare
and the mouse don't tire.

253
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,590
They pretend and they terrify us.

254
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,236
But the wolf already ate many.

255
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,194
Have you smelt the scent
when the wind blows from the south?

256
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,075
You know you can never come back,
it's all the wolf's waiting for.

257
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,118
You're all scared of the wolf

258
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,476
but is there anything more terrible
than remaining here?

259
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,073
I'd never seen Valentina
so happy.

260
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,559
A year ago I'd have bet
she'd never live with anyone.

261
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,753
Imagine my reaction when
she told me about your flat!

262
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,557
It's when she seems happy
that all hell can break loose!

263
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,593
That's the way she is.

264
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,591
When something nice could begin,
she runs away.

265
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,518
Is there something I don't know?

266
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,359
I wanted to surprise her

267
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,439
and I put a child's lamp
in the far room.

268
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,278
I wanted her to feel
everything was easy and nice.

269
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:01,310
I thought she was finally ready
to have a baby with me.

270
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,360
She didn't tell me anything.

271
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,314
She's not coming back.

272
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,556
I know her.

273
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:33,196
<The direct train>
<from Milan Oentral station... >

274
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,469
<is now arriving at platform one. >

275
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,878
If there's one thing I hate,
it's when people are false.

276
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,516
You're not angry at me, are you?

277
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,358
I'm angry at Oarlo.

278
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,471
What's he done to you this time?

279
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,672
I'm sure that girl
goes in my bedroom.

280
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,514
I've found things out of place.

281
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,156
At least you talk to each other.

282
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,471
My father comes home from work,

283
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,468
if I'm lucky he talks about work,
if I'm not, he pisses me off.

284
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,872
Then he lies down on the sofa
and falls asleep.

285
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,280
Your problem is that you're jealous.

286
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,436
No way, don't be silly!

287
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,272
I wanted to come
to the club the other night.

288
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,317
Then I thought Oarlo needed
to spend some time with me,

289
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,078
so I didn't come.

290
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,032
What was the film like?

291
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,029
We didn't watch any film.

292
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,830
He didn't come till late at night.

293
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,149
It's probably a phase.

294
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,113
I sometimes think
it's better if I leave.

295
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,038
Where to?

296
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,873
London.

297
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,159
But we're going this summer, right?

298
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,271
My parents have almost given in.

299
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,357
Have you spoken to Oarlo about it?

300
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,270
I don't want to go for holiday.

301
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,113
- I want to go there to stay.
- Oool!

302
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,233
With everyone going crazy
looking for us!

303
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,911
It's Monica. If you want,
I'll tell her I'm not going.

304
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,838
Do as you like.

305
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,878
Oome on, Vale, you come too.

306
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,076
- I don't like to leave you this way.
- Gio', leave me alone.

307
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,993
Gio'...

308
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,434
I've made you a copy
of Exhausted's OD.

309
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,508
You're strange, but I love you.

310
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,794
The other day
I took a photo of Vale.

311
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,399
What about it?

312
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,674
She looks so much like her mother.

313
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,314
Thank God she doesn't look like you!

314
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,635
Were you with her when she died?

315
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,592
Valentina had just been born.

316
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,473
Had you been together long?

317
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,997
- We'd just split up.
- Split up?

318
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,875
We'd known each other since
we were kids, it's hard to explain.

319
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,434
More than lovers we were siblings.

320
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,869
- Which of you broke it off?
- She did.

321
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,398
At least five times.

322
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,520
And every time I stopped her.

323
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,308
I couldn't even bear the idea.

324
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,273
It was hard for her too.

325
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,469
We weren't able
to fall in love with anyone else,

326
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,830
nor could we stay together.

327
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,836
So she'd give in, but every time
we got back together it was worse.

328
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,195
Then one day she just upped it
and went to London to a friend's.

329
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,555
I knew nothing about her for a year.

330
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,512
And how was Vale born?

331
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,755
Then she called me one day
and asked me to go and see her.

332
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,035
Athos, do you think Vale
is unhappy with me?

333
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,874
No, why?

334
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,479
No reason.

335
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,879
Vale?

336
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,909
I waited for you outside school.

337
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,792
How did you get home?

338
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,791
Fancy something to eat?

339
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,077
If the sun comes out,
I'm going for a walk at the Oanonica.

340
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,157
Want to come?

341
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,432
If that bitch gives me another D
the day after tomorrow, it's the end.

342
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,313
- Why should she?
- Because she hates me.

343
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,596
And maths stinks,
like your risotto.

344
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,791
You'd better study today instead.

345
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,797
We'll postpone the walk.

346
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,389
Too late now, you said we would go.

347
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,555
Did we forget the teachers just said
your work is erratic?

348
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,478
What a pain!

349
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,270
They always say that.

350
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,599
Your work is erratic,
could do better...

351
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,995
They didn't say that about Marta.

352
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,236
Marta's a nerd!

353
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,399
You don't want a daughter like her!

354
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,469
The "Giro d'Italia" begins
and he's already in the lead.

355
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,511
It isn't a race!

356
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,832
She's right behind him!

357
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,030
- And he wins!
- What the hell are you saying?

358
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,629
The champion of Mortirolo!

359
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,709
- A champ, ladies and gentlemen.
- It's not fair!

360
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,676
The rivals are complaining,
but history has been made.

361
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,999
Athos says he wants to go away,

362
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,714
he can't take any more, he's stifled.

363
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,992
He says that every time
he's without a girlfriend.

364
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,236
I'll tell him that later.

365
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,072
Gio' and Monica...

366
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,716
want us to sign up
for salsa and merengue lessons.

367
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,388
Why don't you and Athos come too?

368
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,354
I already dance very well.
There's no need.

369
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,879
You do?

370
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,958
- No?
- No.

371
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,909
Daddy...

372
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,913
Have you ever thought
about going away?

373
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,079
- Where to?
- Just to get up and go some place.

374
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,914
Without me.

375
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,671
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

376
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,959
You look tired, you know?

377
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,719
Oarlo?

378
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,758
Who's Elena?

379
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,833
A friend.

380
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,593
Oome on!

381
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,675
- Are you leaving?
- Pardon?

382
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,314
I mean station...
I thought you were leaving.

383
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,431
Yes. Station... I am leaving.

384
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,034
- So you're not from Sondrio?
- No.

385
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,074
Pity!

386
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,429
- Have you someone waiting?
- You're very reserved, aren't you?

387
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,078
I do this job to know people also.

388
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,918
In five minutes?

389
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,149
If you want, I'll take you to Sweden.

390
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,590
No, the station will do.

391
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,474
What mark?

392
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,194
Oonsidering the effort...

393
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,789
- D minus!
- D minus?

394
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,518
- 1,000 of them?
- Yes.

395
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,551
How are you, little witch?

396
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,076
Hadn't you buried
your paraglider?

397
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,594
Hurry up! Gi-o's waiting for me.

398
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,268
I asked how you were,
not to stress me out.

399
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,789
You're right,
but I'm on afternoon shift.

400
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,231
- How about you, monster?
- I feel like a god today!

401
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,715
- How did it turn out?
- How did you manage to take it?

402
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,354
- You know that...
- Really?

403
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,314
- What are you talking about?
- What are your plans?

404
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,795
- Where are they?
- There's one here.

405
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,076
The others are in the back.

406
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,552
I don't want Vale to see that stuff.

407
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,399
What? Let me see. What is it?

408
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:00,075
My boss's electoral campaign.

409
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,555
Oool!
You work for a guy like this?

410
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,072
What crime am I about
to become an accomplice to?

411
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,999
Oatechism, exposure, you decide.

412
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,476
Will you let me in on this?

413
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,599
Tonight.

414
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,838
All right.

415
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,071
- Bye.
- Bye, Vale.

416
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,434
Bye.

417
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,710
And now straight to the summit!

418
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,038
You are about to immortalize
the hero killing the dictator!

419
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,757
South-west wind, off we go!
Are you shooting?

420
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,598
You're going out live.

421
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,116
Has the accused anything to add?

422
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,799
I'm guilty!

423
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,797
You can fire me if you want.

424
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,277
It's raining.

425
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,830
- You've been asleep for an hour.
- What?

426
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,431
You were making groaning noises.

427
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,078
I had a strange dream.

428
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,397
I could hear your voice.

429
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,678
You were calling me.

430
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,189
I thought I was getting closer,

431
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,118
but your voice sounded
further away...

432
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,996
until I heard it no more.

433
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,160
I'm starved.

434
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,951
- Do you fancy a pizza?
- Yeah.

435
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,469
Have a shower and we'll go.

436
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,509
Hello?

437
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,473
<Oarlo?>

438
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,438
Who's that?

439
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,159
Valentina.

440
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,593
<Valentina?>

441
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,757
<Don't ever do this again!>

442
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,272
<- I heard her voice. >
- Don't call me again! Got it?

443
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,039
What do you want?

444
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,274
<- What do you want?>
- I don't know.

445
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,555
<- Where are you?>
- Not in Sondrio, don't worry.

446
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,313
Write down my cell phone number.

447
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,955
338...

448
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,879
338?

449
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,516
<1680041.>

450
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,233
- Have you seen my cell phone?
- No.

451
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,988
Hello?

452
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,278
Sorry, who's that?

453
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,959
Just a second.

454
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,037
- Who is it?
- Elena.

455
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,194
I told you not to call me at home.

456
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,080
<When may I cease being clandestine?>

457
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:10,831
- I'm not in the mood forjoking.
- Oarlo, your mobile was dead!

458
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,510
- Shall we do something tonight?
<- I can't talk right now. >

459
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,235
- I'll call you later.
<- I'm going out, I won't be here. >

460
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,519
Hi.

461
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,516
Your face looks weary.

462
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,589
Yes.

463
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,837
I'm sorry about yesterday.

464
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,393
We went to
Vinicio Oapossela's concert.

465
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,473
I'd got a ticket for you too.

466
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,511
I'm the one who's sorry.

467
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,075
- Did you enjoy yourself?
- Very much.

468
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,838
He played South American covers,
you'd have liked it.

469
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,677
Athos told me
you were really down yesterday.

470
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,033
How are things with Vale?

471
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,073
Normal.

472
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,515
Your face doesn't look normal.

473
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,038
What does it look like?

474
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:53,198
Fine, when you decide I'm part of
your life, call me.

475
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,639
Elena!

476
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,269
Wait!

477
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,755
Elena, please...

478
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:20,077
You know, Dad, the class
is terrified of tomorrow's test.

479
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,192
Why aren't you eating?

480
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,318
I'm not hungry.

481
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,838
Did you ever panic, feeling
you've got mice in your guts?

482
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,558
Is it that bad?

483
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,832
That maths Nazi
doesn't know how to teach.

484
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,838
Then she expects us
to understand her!

485
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,269
It's facing people
like her that you grow up.

486
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,270
What do you do when you panic?

487
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,790
I discuss it with someone.

488
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,588
You never talk
about your problems to me.

489
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,829
Unfortunately I don't get on
very well with maths,

490
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,078
but if I work hard,
I swear no equation...

491
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,793
.. can escape from me.

492
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,079
Hello?

493
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,433
Tell your Elena that I live here too

494
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,029
and I sometimes answer the phone!

495
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,195
Bye.

496
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,032
What do you mean bye?

497
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,879
We have to rack our brains.

498
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,876
This evening, I swear.

499
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:15,918
Okay, keep your mobile on.
If I start to panic, I'll call you.

500
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,714
I promise.

501
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,271
Where to?

502
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,039
Hello.

503
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,396
And she comes with you in the taxi?

504
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,038
Sometimes.

505
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,992
And what do you talk about?

506
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,268
School, people.

507
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,633
Sometimes she chooses my girlfriends.

508
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,474
Are you... happy?

509
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:44,949
Since I went to Lisbon
you haven't written.

510
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,870
It's what you wanted, Valentina.

511
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,153
When?

512
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,788
I was hoping you'd disobey me.

513
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,116
What have you come here for?

514
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,916
Why have you come?

515
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:55,557
How many days have gone by,
do you think?

516
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,511
Tell me what you want.

517
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,149
About 5,400 days.

518
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,709
Each one was worth double to me...

519
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,233
Triple.

520
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:20,278
So 16,000 days have gone by.

521
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,517
Does she look like me?

522
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:46,195
I want to know if you've come
to ruin everything.

523
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,637
She's very beautiful.

524
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,317
She's the same age
you were when I met you.

525
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,317
Does she ask you about me?
Sometimes?

526
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,993
Oarlo's not here.

527
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,159
<- Know what?>
- Let's hear.

528
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,830
<The garage is closed>
<until further notice. >

529
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,759
<- Do you know what that means?>
- What?

530
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:57,838
<I succeeded, the bastard>
<gave himself away!>

531
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:01,350
- If it makes you happy.
<- You don't appreciate art. >

532
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,438
<Tell your father to call me>
<when you hear from him. >

533
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:19,388
<The number you have dialled>
<is unavailable, try again later. >

534
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,990
I never breastfed her.

535
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,759
I couldn't even touch her.

536
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,479
She would cry.

537
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,072
She could sense it.

538
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,795
No one understood.

539
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:04,511
When you suggested
you take care of her,

540
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,314
did you imagine this would happen?

541
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,794
I didn't care about her.

542
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:19,154
All that mattered was
that she could bring you back.

543
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,152
And when I realised
you wouldn't come back,

544
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,591
she had become my daughter

545
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,350
and she was all that mattered to me.

546
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,560
You're not good, you're cruel.

547
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,873
The weather's changing
and it's getting dark.

548
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,953
Stand up.

549
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,596
<Vale and Oarlo speaking,>
<we're not home. >

550
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,270
<Leave a message and we'll call back. >
<Maybe. >

551
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,600
<- Hello, who's that?>
- Me.

552
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:09,392
<- Where are you, in the jungle?>
- I've made up my mind.

553
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,877
<What a voice!>
<Has your cat been run over?>

554
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,158
- I've decided it's tomorrow.
<- What is?>

555
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,639
Some days I can feel her.

556
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:12,755
I touch my chest and know
she is doing the same.

557
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:18,433
Think you can just turn up and say:
"Hello, I'm your mother"?

558
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,589
I think I should see her.

559
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:26,239
She might think about you,
but she doesn't miss you.

560
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,349
She doesn't want you any more.

561
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:37,789
Oarlo...

562
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,353
Oarlo...

563
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:57,236
What would you do?

564
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,190
She doesn't need you.

565
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,439
Go away.

566
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,390
I don't want to hurt you.

567
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,238
No, it won't hurt her.

568
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:15,150
Go tell her you've always been there
that her real father

569
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:19,114
is an idiot going by who
doesn't even know she exists.

570
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,235
She'll be happy to know that.

571
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,754
And tell her you forgot to abort her!
She'll be even happier!

572
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:03,032
I've never cared for anyone
the way I cared for you.

573
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:08,275
But yesterday when you called,
I just wished you were dead.

574
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,993
I am dead.

575
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,440
Excuse me, can you take our photo?

576
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:22,798
- Of course.
- With the elephant behind us.

577
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,558
- Ready?
- Yes.

578
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:12,108
Vale?

579
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:12,792
Good luck with your test.

580
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,708
- What school are you at?
- Sciences.

581
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,794
- How old are you?
- 14.

582
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,754
How long do you want to be away?

583
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,792
At least a week.

584
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,878
Oity?

585
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,719
Genoa.

586
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:25,874
- Money?
- This.

587
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:32,351
How long did you say
you want to stay? A week?

588
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:37,872
Sondrio-Milan train, 7 euros.
Milan-Genoa, 14 euros.

589
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,879
Pretend these don't exist.
Return ticket.

590
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,798
Is there someone you can stay with?

591
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,829
One day in a cheap B&B.

592
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,593
Breakfast, lunch, dinner.

593
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:53,072
Do you follow me?

594
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:01,158
Listen.

595
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:06,915
I can lend you something, but you'll
have to tell me how many days.

596
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,154
- A week.
- A week?

597
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:14,434
- Do you know what that entails?
- 700 euros?

598
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:18,389
Apart from the money,
you'll be reported to the police.

599
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,795
I've met your folk, you know?

600
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,436
- He's not such a huge jerk.
- Yes, he's only a jerk.

601
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,715
I shouldn't have taken her to you.

602
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,797
You're putting doubts in her head.

603
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,429
Have you got a cigarette?

604
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,399
Thanks.

605
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:49,237
Please would you go
get three coffees? We all need some.

606
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,317
Put it on my bill.

607
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,880
- Normal or spiked?
- Normal.

608
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:07,428
Money's not a problem, I know
who can lodge you for free

609
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:11,553
but I want you to think it over,
I don't want you to panic, okay?

610
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,831
Good morning.

611
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,952
The cheapest fare for Genoa, please.

612
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:40,153
- He likes you, I can tell.
- Stop it!

613
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,552
13.22.

614
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,829
Shit! The first to Milan
leaves in 90 minutes.

615
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,871
Please, tell me you don't like him.

616
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,753
- Out it out!
- Tell me!

617
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,872
What difference does it make?

618
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,198
- Tell me!
- No, not for now.

619
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:02,396
Thank you. Goodbye.

620
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:09,715
So, you call Oarlo,
you tell him I called,

621
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,391
that I was already in Florence,

622
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,999
pissed, and that I was going
even further, maybe to Rome.

623
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:23,271
Okay, your best friend doesn't
run away from home every day.

624
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,994
You are my best friend.
You do know that?

625
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,556
Gio'... Thanks.

626
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,840
For skipping the math test
for a good cause?

627
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,679
It's Mirko!

628
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,108
Hello?

629
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,634
Hi.

630
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:38,909
Yes.

631
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,391
No, not tomorrow too.

632
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,239
Vale?

633
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:45,872
She's leaving.

634
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,158
Okay, I'll put her on.

635
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,153
Hello?

636
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,149
Hi.

637
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,792
Yes, I've made up my mind.

638
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:44,191
We did it!

639
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,759
Look at the water, soldier!

640
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,913
Everyone soaking wet, soldier.

641
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:53,588
Look, soldier! Smile!

642
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:02,310
No one's been held back a year, now
will you buy me the green aquarium?

643
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:03,635
The aquarium!

644
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,592
Let's bet...

645
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,279
an ice-cream.

646
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:10,358
- Shall we go to the submarine?
- Yes.

647
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,437
Let's go, soldier!

648
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:18,873
I'll get you!

649
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,149
Tremendous revenge!

650
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,313
Oome on!

651
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,119
I'll catch you!

652
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,033
Got you!

653
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,078
Where are you?

654
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:43,429
What's that woman's name?

655
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:49,114
- What woman?
- I saw you arguing at the station.

656
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,038
Are you spying on me?

657
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:56,876
She looks like a strong woman.

658
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,470
It's clear she cares for you.

659
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,030
I don't want to talk about it.

660
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:11,035
Sooner or later she'll want
to have a baby with you.

661
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,880
In fact,
she probably asked you already.

662
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,797
I don't want to talk.

663
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:21,079
So Valentina
will have a baby brother.

664
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,153
No matter what her name is,
she'll end up calling her Mom.

665
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,713
Pull over.

666
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,031
Pull over, please.

667
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:02,191
Will you hug me?

668
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,474
If you can, forgive me.

669
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,951
I'll accompany you.

670
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,709
Don't look at me, please.

671
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,989
Is there a reason
why you stopped talking to me?

672
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,076
What have I done to you?

673
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:00,551
You're late.

674
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:14,558
All right. Then bye.

675
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:18,918
- Is this seat free?
- Yes.

676
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:22,278
Monica, there are two over here.

677
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:32,156
<The direct train to Milan Oentral>
<is leaving from platform two. >

678
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:09,679
Squirrel!

679
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,956
Squirrel, where are you?

680
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:17,197
Butterfly, I see you're lost

681
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:20,551
and you can't find your way home.

682
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:24,833
My God, you must be the wolf!

683
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:28,999
How come you know me?
We've never met before.

684
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:30,792
Everybody told me about you.

685
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,673
They told me to run away
if ever I met you.

686
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:36,440
Woods animals are like that.

687
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:39,996
They accuse others
of their own fears.

688
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:49,152
But you're not like them
and if you have ventured this far

689
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:51,999
it's because you want me to lead you
to the other side of the woods.

690
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,589
Right?

691
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:57,394
Run away! Run away!

692
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,318
If I follow you, you'll cheat me

693
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:03,115
and I'll never return
to my village again.

694
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:08,394
Maybe, but in the village you can't
see the other side of the night,

695
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,672
where pain and beauty
are the same colour.

696
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,632
And everything is quiet,

697
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:17,549
oblivion
and endless flowering cherry trees.

698
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:18,831
YOU MUST BE THE WOLF
