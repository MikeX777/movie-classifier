1
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,833
Drive!

2
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,156
Fuck!

3
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,636
Where's Kenny?

4
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,315
Dave, where's your brother?

5
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,077
Dave!

6
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,600
There was nothing I could do.

7
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,353
Mr. De Swaef,
not only have you

8
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,477
refused to cooperate
with the investigation,

9
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,200
you have also consistently
hindered it.

10
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,872
Despite previous convictions
and the chance to get professional help

11
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,278
with your persistent drug problem,
you continue to relapse.

12
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,679
I take note
of your difficult childhood

13
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,037
but that cannot excuse
the excessive violence

14
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,915
and brutality
of the acts committed.

15
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,910
We therefore condemn you
to the maximum sentence of seven years.

16
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,034
It'll be alright.

17
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,715
Stef.

18
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,909
Best of luck.

19
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,034
You sleep on top.

20
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,590
The Ardennes

21
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,956
They paid for part of it,
so in exchange,

22
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,917
I had to trim the hedge.

23
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,317
It's bamboo,

24
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,157
so you have
to do it with a machine.

25
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,432
I'd never used one before.

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,550
I'd promised Dad,
so I did it.

27
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,038
I just can't say no.

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,389
Something else to work on,
learning to say no.

29
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,149
While I was trimming,

30
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,516
a splinter flew into my ear.

31
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,951
It pierced my eardrum.

32
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,316
I can't swim for a month.

33
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,755
So...

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,798
Diving in Bali...

35
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,549
My whole trip is ruined.

36
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,797
I'll just have to live with it...

37
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,797
Thanks for listening,
thanks for the meeting.

38
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,872
Thank you, Cindy.

39
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,039
That's the end
of the meeting, but...

40
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,919
I think we have
something to celebrate today.

41
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,870
Sylvie, don't hide.

42
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,072
You have something to say.

43
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,196
- I'm Sylvie, I'm an addict.
- Hello, Sylvie.

44
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,075
I've been clean
two years today.

45
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,635
I hope it stays that way.
I've fought hard for this.

46
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,753
Each and every day,
even now.

47
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,553
You know, my mom...

48
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,670
she always said
that in life

49
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,633
you can be whatever you want
if you want it hard enough.

50
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,879
What bullshit.

51
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,153
It's bullshit
and she knows it.

52
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,350
She's always sat behind the till
at the supermarket...

53
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,798
well, stood.

54
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,749
I always wanted to be Madonna.

55
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,149
Still do.

56
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,276
You don't always get to choose.

57
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,829
What weather it will be,
what men you fall for...

58
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,234
getting hit by a car
and ending up in a wheelchair.

59
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,111
You don't choose those things.

60
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,191
You can lie in bed all day,
crying.

61
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,395
Or you try to make a go of it,
one day at a time.

62
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,031
That's what I did,
'cos that's a choice I do have.

63
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,272
You all do.

64
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,956
I don't need to use anymore.

65
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,034
I couldn't have made it
without you.

66
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,636
I want to thank you for that.

67
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,796
There...

68
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,235
I wish you all
a good 24 hours.

69
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,434
- Thank you, Sylvie.
- Thank you.

70
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,394
Call for you.

71
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,954
It's your mother.

72
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,517
Your mother, on the phone.

73
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,478
Mom, I'm working.

74
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,398
Get out of the way.

75
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,518
When?

76
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,469
OK.

77
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,632
I'll call you later,
don't worry.

78
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,116
Yeah, OK.

79
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,229
Bye.

80
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,078
Can I see it?
Nice.

81
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,953
- Great, huh?
- How are you, honey?

82
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,312
- You?
- Fine.

83
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,559
Hi, Daisy.

84
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,520
- Turn the heat on.
- Just a second...

85
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,631
Have you been good?

86
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,639
Too good...

87
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,915
- How's that?
- It's just...

88
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,556
I look ridiculous
with a dog like that.

89
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,037
You're more of a pit bull, eh?

90
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,914
- Not a chihuahua, for sure.
- Hear that?

91
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,069
Dave's saying mean things...

92
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,520
What's wrong?

93
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,754
It's been approved.

94
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,120
Really?

95
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,959
That's good news...

96
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,519
When?

97
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,030
He gets out Saturday,
9 a.m.

98
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,233
It'll be OK.

99
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,478
De Swaef, get a move on.

100
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,074
A couple of minutes
won't make any difference.

101
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,799
You OK?

102
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,076
- OK?
- Yeah.

103
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,755
Coming!

104
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,475
Here she is,
the flower of the hood.

105
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,353
What's all this?

106
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,311
- Not like that.
- Hi, Mom.

107
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,553
- I already have a tree, Kenny.
- A plastic one.

108
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,680
- Did Patrick come about the boiler?
- This morning.

109
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,036
- Push, Dave.
- Shoes off!

110
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,392
The plastic tree's good enough.
Dave, off with your shoes!

111
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,513
A plastic tree
is a plastic Christmas, Mom.

112
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,437
And who's going to clean up the needles?

113
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,394
Not me.

114
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,157
- I'll do it.
- Mom, do you still have Cha-Chas?

115
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,071
Bounty bars, in the kitchen.

116
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,200
There you go, Mom.

117
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,758
- Do you even know what a broom looks like?
- Imagine it covered with baubles.

118
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,075
Mom...

119
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,271
Doesn't Kenny get a kiss?

120
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,398
Son...

121
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,999
Come here.

122
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,271
He's jealous.

123
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,557
- The three of us together again.
- OK, OK.

124
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,150
Coffee?

125
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,793
Don't you wish
you were a kid again?

126
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,759
Playing football on the square,

127
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,679
then back home

128
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,031
with dirty shoes
to eat cookies.

129
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,232
No worries.

130
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,515
And those weekends in the Ardennes,
good times!

131
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,591
The Ardennes were nice.

132
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,073
The three of us should
go back there sometime.

133
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,950
You were so good there.

134
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,192
Was it the mountains,
the good air?

135
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,477
Fresh air's good for you...

136
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,914
The air's bad here.
I've always said so.

137
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,160
Hills...

138
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,710
There are hills in the Ardennes,
not mountains.

139
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,953
- How old were you then?
- Twelve.

140
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,711
Here, take one.

141
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,069
- Where are all the photos of me?
- What?

142
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,191
How come there are so few
photos of me?

143
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,479
Maybe you're not photogenic?

144
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,959
Come on, let's go.

145
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,391
I'll just put my stuff upstairs.

146
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,390
Wait, sit down.

147
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,599
- I don't want to go through this again.
- It'll be OK, Mom.

148
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,196
I can't take any more.

149
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,831
I tried everything,

150
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,475
but somehow,
things went wrong with you two.

151
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,632
That's just the way it is.

152
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,159
It's up to you now.

153
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,958
Don't worry,
I'll take care of Kenny.

154
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,519
Promise?

155
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,070
Promise?

156
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,834
I promise.

157
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,516
Goddam bunch of losers!

158
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,956
Unbelievable.
Still 0-0.

159
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,191
They're paid a fortune.

160
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,839
How much do you stand to win?

161
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,399
- How much do you stand to win?
- 600, if they score a goal.

162
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,440
- Is he a friend?
- My brother.

163
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,038
Keep him away from the TV.
He's bad luck, I can feel it.

164
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,071
And he stinks of sweat,
I can smell him from here.

165
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,913
Does he ever wash?

166
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,154
This is a carwash.

167
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,475
We need to radiate cleanliness.

168
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,669
Mind your passes, dammit!

169
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,069
I'd like to help you,
but times are hard right now.

170
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,631
- In 3 months, I'll fire those foreigners...
- 3 months!

171
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,394
This isn't Social Services.

172
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,878
Nico, I'd like to help,
but like I said, times are hard.

173
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,874
Come on, let's go.

174
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,679
Penalty!

175
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,592
It's a sure thing,
it's gonna be OK.

176
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,309
Don't mess up!

177
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,075
Robert, if he scores,
I'll double up your 600.

178
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,429
- I'll go to the bank right now.
- Kid, it's not worth it.

179
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,519
And if he doesn't?

180
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,078
You hire Kenny.

181
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,278
OK, deal.

182
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,718
1200, huh?

183
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,030
- Who's taking it?
- Simons.

184
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,789
Come on, Simons, focus.

185
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,679
Not in the middle.
Choose a corner.

186
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,952
Goddammit!
Simons, fucking loser!

187
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,589
What was he thinking?
I said, not in the middle!

188
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,673
Pathetic kick!

189
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,799
How did you know?
He's not missed once this season.

190
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,389
Not when it counts.
Under pressure, he misses every time.

191
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,678
- How do you know?
- I played against him as a kid.

192
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,632
- Where?
- Club Antwerp.

193
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,110
From now on,
you fill in my betting slip.

194
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,714
Monday?

195
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,149
Whatever.

196
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,630
Thank your brother, Nico.
You can send Simons a card too.

197
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,798
- Kenny.
- What?

198
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,913
The name's Kenny.

199
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,431
No crap from you, OK?

200
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,837
Fancy going out tonight?

201
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,391
Or don't you party anymore?

202
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,392
I've got something on.

203
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,391
- What?
- Just something.

204
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,233
A chick?

205
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,559
Lady killer.
Bring her with you.

206
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,513
She's not into that.

207
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,552
- What's her name?
- Julie.

208
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,916
- Julie what? Do I know her?
- No.

209
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,152
- What does she do?
- She works at H&M.

210
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,113
H&M?

211
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,750
- Which one?
- On Meir Street.

212
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,349
- Got a photo?
- Not on me.

213
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,713
I'm just curious to know
who has the honour

214
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,520
of playing with your joystick.

215
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,518
Kiddo...

216
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,671
Look at your face!

217
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,432
You're disgusting.

218
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,920
I'm happy for you. Everyone thought
my brother was queer.

219
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,194
Idiot.

220
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,515
Have you heard from Sylvie?

221
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,197
- Have you seen Sylvie?
- No.

222
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,718
You know...

223
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,190
I was hoping
she'd be here today.

224
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,438
But she isn't.

225
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,229
It's those fucking meetings,
making me out to be the bad guy.

226
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,874
Hey, kiddo...

227
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,077
Thanks for coming every Thursday.

228
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,916
I haven't forgotten that.

229
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,469
See you later.

230
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,317
Crap fucking game!

231
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,829
Jacky...

232
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,714
Mom, I'm going out.

233
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,556
- Where are you going?
- Out.

234
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,634
- Tomorrow's your first day, isn't it?
- Yes.

235
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,919
What're you going to do?

236
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,714
Rob a bank.

237
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,634
Jeez!
I'll be back in an hour.

238
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,715
Yes?

239
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,196
I think I know where.

240
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,391
Don't worry.

241
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,594
No, no.

242
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,349
I still fight my demons
every day.

243
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,877
But I got good news today.

244
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,358
I get to see my kid
once a fortnight.

245
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,758
That's better than nothing.

246
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,114
I wanted to say
that I'm grateful for this life.

247
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,071
I wish you all
a good 24 hours.

248
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,198
Thank you, Chris.

249
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,230
Does anybody else
want to share?

250
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,753
I have something to say.

251
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,878
We have a newcomer.
Introduce yourself.

252
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,234
- I'm Kenny.
- Hello, Kenny.

253
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,800
- I heard... what's your name?
- Chris.

254
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,989
I heard Chris use the word grateful.

255
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,151
I've something to say about that.

256
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,229
Grateful for what?
Not living in the bush

257
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,679
where you have to walk
40km for a glass of dirty water?

258
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,400
I don't get what
you have to be grateful for.

259
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,752
Your whole life
in that fucking wheelchair.

260
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,557
Know what I'd do, Chris?

261
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,513
Buy some speed and heroin
and finish yourself off.

262
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,990
- That's the best you can hope for now.
- Kenny...

263
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,470
- I'm talking!
- Kenny, please...

264
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,079
No Sylvie, no...

265
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,672
I kept my mouth shut.

266
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,758
Because I love you.

267
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,993
Four years
that I'll never get back.

268
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,472
Four years...

269
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,240
with Moroccans bossing me around.

270
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,789
Not being able to sleep
'cos the junkie

271
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,837
is always beating off.

272
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,635
All I could think about was you.

273
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,354
And what did you do?

274
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,952
You let me down.

275
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,074
No news from you for two years.

276
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,713
Why?

277
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,479
What would you know,
about gratitude, Sylvie?

278
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,790
Sylvie...

279
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,556
Sylvie, wait!

280
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,674
Did you come
to make me look ridiculous?

281
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,272
Was there someone else?

282
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,475
No.

283
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,949
- I'd just had enough.
- Enough?

284
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,471
Don't you think I'd had enough
of that fucking cell?

285
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,679
Sylvie, it's over.
I accept that.

286
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,714
I'm not proud
of who I used to be.

287
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,838
Can't we just...

288
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,633
forget what happened
and start over?

289
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,956
Wait!

290
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,994
As friends, just friends.

291
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,515
I know I've made mistakes.

292
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,391
But in four years,
a man has time to think.

293
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,518
I want to make a fresh start.

294
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,353
- Sylvie!
- Stay back, pal!

295
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,994
Is everything OK?

296
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,796
- Everything's fine.
- I'm OK.

297
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,719
- You can't expect...
- I expect nothing from you.

298
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,476
Just to see you
from time to time, that's all.

299
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,831
Who else can I talk to?

300
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,639
The kid?

301
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,432
Don't you get it?

302
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,155
What are you doing
for Christmas?

303
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,313
Mom's cooking a stew,

304
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,631
she'd love it if you came.

305
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,438
You'd get a chance to see her again.
And the kid.

306
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,118
Just the four of us,
like it used to be.

307
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,713
As friends.

308
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,879
I can't, I have to work.

309
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,634
In the Mercury?
That's not until 10, is it?

310
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,073
We'll eat at half seven
and you go after. Perfect!

311
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,873
Come on, Sylvie.

312
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,637
- You know me, don't you?
- Yeah, I do.

313
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,677
You know what I mean.

314
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,792
I'll think about it.

315
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,879
- That was an accident.
- Come off it, Kenny.

316
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,073
I'll see you Saturday.

317
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,433
- I'll give you a push.
- No!

318
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,670
It's expensive for such a small flat.

319
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,599
It's got something.

320
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,558
We've been looking for a year,
nothing's ever good enough.

321
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,277
It's not exactly luxurious,

322
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,432
- but we can afford it, can't we?
- Not now, Mom.

323
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,038
What are we going to do?

324
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,234
We'll wait a while,
but this is a possibility.

325
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,198
About Saturday.

326
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,360
He'll find it strange
if you don't come.

327
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,909
Maybe we should tell him now
after all.

328
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,271
I know we agreed
to give it more time.

329
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,518
Give him some time,
he's just got out.

330
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,912
D'you want him
to be born with lung cancer?

331
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,914
So after 10 minutes I thought,
I'll quit,

332
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,594
but the problem was...
Hey, buddy!

333
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,190
I'm talking.

334
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,997
Tough little beggar, huh?
Here, have a crisp.

335
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,229
Fussy too...

336
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,798
- He smells scum.
- It's because she doesn't know him.

337
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,515
Right, Daisy?

338
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,710
She'll get to know me better.

339
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,359
The problem was
that it got stuck between my feet.

340
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,871
I tried to free it
and suddenly, bam!

341
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,071
A piece of my tooth.
See?

342
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,314
And she started crying
'cos my mouth was bleeding.

343
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,949
- True, Mom?
- Yes, it's true.

344
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,437
What?

345
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,630
- I've heard that tale lots of times.
- It's still a good one.

346
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,518
At last.

347
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,356
There you are!
What's up, dude?

348
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,791
Did you bring the mayonnaise?

349
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,354
I invited a homeless man,
'cos I'm so big-hearted.

350
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,831
- You wear this.
- I don't wear bonnets.

351
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,838
- Hello, son.
- Smells good.

352
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,875
Remember Sylvie?

353
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,878
- Hi.
- Hi.

354
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,670
Hey there.

355
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,952
- When are you going to tell him?
- Soon.

356
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,352
That's the problem
with all these big companies.

357
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,071
You have to differentiate
within your own market.

358
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,156
Simple economics.

359
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,313
Ladies first, bro'.

360
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,750
I haven't been idle
these past four years.

361
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,233
She's starting to get to know me.
She's not barking anymore.

362
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,239
- Pass your glass, Mom.
- Thanks, son.

363
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,880
Thanks.

364
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,791
- No thanks.
- Dave's quit drinking. Didn't you know?

365
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,751
What's all this?

366
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,320
You neither?

367
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,872
- Congratulations.
- It's been three years, eh Dave?

368
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,679
You could make an effort for me.
It's Christmas.

369
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,349
In prison
they only celebrate Eid al-Fitr.

370
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,915
No, thanks.

371
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,074
Boys.

372
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,430
Chill out, kiddo.

373
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,155
I am cool.

374
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,675
How about going out tonight?

375
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,109
Sure.

376
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,559
- To a bar?
- We could start there.

377
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,791
But I thought
we'd keep Sylvie company.

378
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,313
- I have to work...
- We won't bother you.

379
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,998
Not too much anyway.

380
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,238
Dave, call your girlfriend.

381
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,835
Julie. Ask if she wants to tag along.

382
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,509
- Julie?
- Works at H&M.

383
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,353
- You have a sweetheart, Dave?
- No, it's nothing.

384
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,112
Just a quick fuck
from time to time?

385
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,034
That's no way to talk.

386
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,240
Dave, now you've got one,
you should marry her right away.

387
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,596
Make it official, before she runs away.

388
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,389
Right, Mom?

389
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,079
Right.

390
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,239
Sylvie, do you still like
working in that club?

391
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,600
I'm doing
a massage course now too.

392
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,471
- Really?
- So if all goes well...

393
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,479
- Is Rudy still running the place?
- Khalid's taken it over.

394
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,513
- Two years ago.
- Khalid?

395
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,113
- Really?
- Yes.

396
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,430
- Wasn't he in Amsterdam?
- He's got two clubs now.

397
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,473
Fuck me. He's doing well.

398
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,511
Does he pay enough
for a princess like you?

399
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,520
Yeah, he takes good care of me.

400
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,634
What do you mean by that?

401
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,314
Just that...

402
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,751
Always pays me on time.

403
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,199
If I need a day off, it's OK.

404
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,512
- So, Khalid looks after you?
- I think Sylvie means...

405
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,671
I heard what she said!

406
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,035
Boys!

407
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,719
Sorry.
I didn't mean anything.

408
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,598
Thank you all for being here.
You're family...

409
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,913
and that's fucking important.

410
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,790
Merckx!

411
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,349
Merckx is gay.

412
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,998
Who then?

413
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,394
Who?

414
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,194
Jean-Claude Van Damme!

415
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,950
- Van Damme, he's a faggot.
- What?

416
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:36,318
The way he kicks and boxes,
with top acting work.

417
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,797
You think, kiddo?
Van Damme is the best.

418
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,712
- Merckx is the best!
- Get outta here.

419
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,713
- Pure strength of character.
- It's all doping.

420
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,113
Van Damme has mental problems.

421
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,709
Merckx won so many classics.

422
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,793
- Classics?
- Yes, classics!

423
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,794
- Paris-Roubaix, the Tour of Flanders!
- Bloodsport, Kickboxer!

424
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,310
- Lombardy, The Walloon Arrow!
- Timecop, Maximum Risk!

425
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,314
- Those are classics!
- I'd like to see Van Damme race a Tour!

426
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,154
I'd like to see Merckx
kick a cigarette out of someone's mouth.

427
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,755
Then we'll see!

428
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,394
Put your glass down.
Stand here.

429
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,718
Don't move!

430
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,434
Fuck, man...

431
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,596
You OK, Danny?

432
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,075
Kenny...

433
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,676
Things have changed
since you went inside.

434
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,960
I'm not sure
how to tell you this...

435
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,271
A lot can happen in four years...

436
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,674
You don't...

437
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,034
always control things, see?

438
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,594
- Sometimes, things happen...
- Come on.

439
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,999
Hey, how's it going?

440
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,555
- You OK, pal?
- Long time no see.

441
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,037
- Did you fall out with your hairdresser?
- Fuck you, man.

442
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,111
Fucking idiot.

443
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,435
- How are you doing?
- What?

444
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,277
- I'm fine.
- You are?

445
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,436
- Got a job?
- Carwash, with my brother.

446
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,553
Washing cars?

447
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,953
- Look, if you like...
- No, Khalid, I'm done with that.

448
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,789
You need money, don't you?
Look at yourself!

449
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,839
You can say whatever you like,

450
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,310
making out you're
the Tony Montana of the city.

451
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,796
But to me,
you're still that 12-year old

452
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,839
who ran home crying
'cos he'd pissed his pants.

453
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,591
Maybe you should go home, Kenny.

454
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,749
Still can't clean up
your own shit?

455
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,957
Times have changed, Kenny.

456
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,078
Call your little friend over,
I've got nothing to lose.

457
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,475
- No?
- No.

458
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,835
34 years old...

459
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,318
Does Sylvie have to serve drinks
the rest of her life?

460
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,033
Or should I take care of her?

461
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,520
- What?
- Should I take care...

462
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,758
- Come on, we're leaving.
- Why?

463
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,718
I shouldn't have come here.

464
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,710
- Come on, we're leaving.
- Kenny, take it easy.

465
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,510
Sylvie...
I'm sorry for everything.

466
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,110
- Fuck you!
- Kenny...

467
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,554
Keep out of this!

468
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,078
Is this what I come back to?

469
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,111
You, butt naked turning on
that Moroccan scum?

470
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,078
D'you know why
I stopped coming to visit, Kenny?

471
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,997
'Cos every time
I saw your face

472
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,875
I thought about all the bad decisions
I'd ever made in my life.

473
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,079
And that's why I'm
standing here butt naked.

474
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,917
Somebody had to say something.

475
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,392
You're late.

476
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,838
It's not my fault
those fucking buses are so slow.

477
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,554
- What?
- Nothing.

478
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,436
I'm doing my best, aren't I?

479
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,313
Kenny...

480
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,394
- Can we talk later?
- I can do better, I know.

481
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,951
No, about something else.

482
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,154
Out with it.

483
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,272
Later.

484
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,231
Kenny!

485
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,757
Stop, you idiot!

486
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,593
Fuck you, asshole!

487
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,400
- What the fuck was that?
- He attacked me!

488
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,798
What's going on here?

489
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,998
Are you crazy?

490
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,717
You call this normal, Nico?

491
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,956
I said don't bring your crap in here!

492
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,310
- They started it.
- They did, did they?

493
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,354
Get your stuff.
I've had it with your bullshit.

494
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,439
- Robert, they attacked him.
- I don't give a damn!

495
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,230
Robert, you can't do this.
I'm 10 minutes early every day.

496
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,511
I've never had a day off sick.

497
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,875
I need this job.

498
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,880
Poor Dave, what a pretty tale,

499
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,440
very moving.

500
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,719
I don't give a fuck!

501
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,071
I said no crap!

502
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,236
Hand your badges in
at the office.

503
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,714
- Goddammit!
- Robert!

504
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,913
You're going to work
in a state like that?

505
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,910
Someone has to work, Dave.

506
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,036
Do you know how much kids cost?

507
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,356
Kenny can fix something up.

508
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,150
Yeah, right, Kenny's gonna fix it.

509
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:46,037
- You're such a wimp.
- A wimp?

510
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,639
Do I have to tell him?
He doesn't scare me.

511
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,111
That's not it,
I'm waiting for the right moment.

512
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,113
He's my brother.

513
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,278
Am I a pain in the butt?

514
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,798
- You can tell me if I am.
- No.

515
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,315
Sometimes.

516
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,479
Sometimes...

517
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,390
I don't want to nag.

518
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,398
Will you get me some water?

519
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,395
What?

520
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,112
- The doctor said I should.
- Does he know you're pregnant?

521
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,239
- Don't panic, sweetie.
- Cold hands!

522
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,669
I just thought
things would be different.

523
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,314
And I didn't?

524
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,199
Do you think I like
going from one crap job to another?

525
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,313
I'm trying.
Tell me what you want.

526
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,911
You know what I want.

527
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,230
I just want to be dull.

528
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,636
Come home at 5 p.m.,

529
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,953
put the potatoes on,
watch TV.

530
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,632
Ask my man
about his day at work.

531
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,515
Go swimming with my kid
once a week.

532
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:30,152
A dull fucking life.

533
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,795
If not with you,
I'll find someone else.

534
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,633
I want to be dull too.

535
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,077
Well, not dull, but...

536
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,870
Really? Getting into a fight
and losing your job

537
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,873
isn't what I'd call dull,
it's stupid.

538
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,632
I couldn't help it.

539
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,189
- Sorry.
- Stop saying sorry all the time.

540
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,951
I have to go, sorry.

541
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,515
OK.

542
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,760
- Tomorrow at 11.
- Where?

543
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,833
That flat.

544
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,478
Bye, Daisy.
Be good.

545
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,870
- Love you.
- I know.

546
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,960
- How are you, Louise?
- Not getting any younger, Dave.

547
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,189
- Give me that.
- That's sweet of you.

548
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,600
Where have you been?

549
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,279
- You OK?
- I need your car a while longer.

550
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,470
What for?

551
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,314
What's this?

552
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,071
- It was an accident.
- An accident?

553
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,880
He fell down...

554
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,592
I just wanted to slap him
and he fell.

555
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,400
Who?

556
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,319
That fucking Khalid.

557
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,393
He had his hands
all over Sylvie.

558
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,759
No one can touch Sylvie.

559
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,999
Kenny...

560
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,514
- Is he dead?
- Stef will help us.

561
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,712
- Us?
- You have to help me, bro'.

562
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,791
- Are you serious?
- It's not my fault he fell.

563
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,238
- Throw him in the river.
- No.

564
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,358
We're going to the Ardennes.

565
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,277
Stef will make him disappear.

566
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,630
You've gotta be kidding, Kenny.

567
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,911
You can't expect me
to do this.

568
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,876
I won't go back inside.

569
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,637
I'll get life for this.

570
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,873
What do you want me to do?
Hand myself in?

571
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,030
Is that what you want?
OK, I'll hand myself in.

572
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,879
I'll tell them what went down
four years ago.

573
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,238
We can share a cell.

574
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,994
- What are you gonna do?
- Get my coat.

575
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,037
Stef?
We're leaving now.

576
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,194
Hello.

577
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,910
- What will you have?
- Nothing.

578
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:01,517
Beer.

579
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,834
Flemish?

580
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,112
- Where are you off to?
- Toilet.

581
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,070
Don't be cross, sweetie,
I won't be able to make it at 11.

582
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,671
You'll have to go alone.

583
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,839
I have to sort something out.

584
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,877
I'll see you tomorrow.

585
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,797
I'll call again later.

586
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,078
Love you.

587
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,713
I'm in my lesson.
What's up?

588
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,556
- Is that Stef?
- No.

589
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,914
Who is he then?

590
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,274
I dunno.

591
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,079
Kenny...

592
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,991
Drink up and we'll go.

593
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,554
Where's Stef?

594
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,954
Let's go.

595
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,639
A fucking drag queen...

596
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,311
He's going to help us?

597
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,754
They're here.

598
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,119
Come here.

599
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,793
Kenny.

600
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:05,996
It'll be OK.

601
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,519
Who's this cutie?

602
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,759
My brother.

603
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,316
So this is Dave?

604
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,755
I've heard a lot about you.

605
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,076
What else can you do in the slammer?
Talk, talk, talk.

606
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,909
Stef.

607
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,399
Delighted to meet you.

608
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,838
This is Joyce,
Don't be afraid, she doesn't bite.

609
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,710
Unless you ask for it,
Kenny.

610
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,438
This must be our friend.

611
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,319
We'll deal with him later.

612
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,713
Who fancies...

613
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,152
a pancake?

614
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,519
Understand?
If you see anything, don't play hero.

615
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,670
Call me, OK?

616
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:12,795
- Another beer?
- No, I must get on.

617
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,751
I have to drop in
on the two weirdos.

618
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:20,439
Call me, OK? See you.

619
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,112
I don't go near women anymore.

620
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,910
It's not that I can't pull them.

621
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,630
Into my nest, one by one,
if need be.

622
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,673
I think twice
before I stick it in something.

623
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,633
Better than that Moroccan dope,
huh, Kenny?

624
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,717
Can we get on with it?

625
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,236
And you, Dave,
got a ball and chain yet?

626
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,279
Is there a Miss Dave?

627
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,109
Or Mr. Dave?
It's allowed, you know.

628
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,030
You have to watch out for them, Dave.

629
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,517
I mean it.

630
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,835
First, they do anything
to trap you.

631
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,199
And once they've got you,
they break you.

632
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,791
Then they run off
with some Moroccan guy.

633
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,272
Then you hear those echoes...

634
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,315
You're my true love,

635
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,756
I can't live without you.

636
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,993
You're the only one for me.

637
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:50,311
Kenny...

638
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:55,873
I once saw an amazing documentary
about cranes.

639
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,799
Do you know those birds?

640
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,951
No?
Let me tell you about them.

641
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:06,078
D'you know what the male does
when the female dies?

642
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,270
No?

643
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,955
He flies as high as he can,

644
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,869
and at the highest point,
he lets himself fall.

645
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,874
Down to the ground.

646
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,430
Know what the female does

647
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,597
when the male dies, Dave?

648
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,790
No?

649
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:31,349
I'll give you three guesses, Dave.

650
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,354
Within five minutes,
she's fucking another.

651
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,673
They're all whores.

652
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,359
We've got a visitor.

653
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:47,751
Who's that?

654
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,679
- Stay calm.
- Stef, who is that?

655
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,957
Just stay calm.

656
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,074
- Hi Stef, how are you?
- Fine. You?

657
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,476
- What's new?
- Not a lot.

658
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,037
- I've got friends round.
- Visitors?

659
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,196
This is Gerard, the gamekeeper.

660
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,919
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

661
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,953
Know what I fancy, Stef?

662
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,999
- A nice cold beer.
- Sure.

663
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:34,397
That's enough, Ricardo!

664
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,435
Fucking winter.

665
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,235
Thanks.

666
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,396
Good health.
No, thank you.

667
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,397
They don't speak much French.

668
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,829
Flemish?

669
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,109
Brothers.

670
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,957
You can see the resemblance.

671
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,513
Shut up, Ricardo!

672
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,400
I don't know
what's gotten into him today.

673
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,271
What brings you here, Gerard?

674
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,874
- I've come to warn you...
- Ah?

675
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:11,676
Sixteen...

676
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,198
Those idiots
left the door open

677
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:17,398
and sixteen got out.
What a shambles!

678
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,400
People don't realise
how aggressive they are.

679
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,673
Have you ever been face to face
with an ostrich?

680
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,236
When they attack,
you don't stand a chance.

681
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,758
If you guys see one,
don't play the hero.

682
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,355
Get Stef to call me.

683
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,273
Enough, Ricardo!

684
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,473
What's wrong, boy?

685
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,834
Got a scent of something?

686
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:39,477
What's wrong?

687
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,475
Who's car is this?

688
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,110
Mine.

689
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,593
Got something in the trunk?

690
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,239
Nothing special.

691
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,280
It must be meat.
Ricardo's never wrong.

692
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,113
If there's meat around,
he'll find it.

693
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,275
Sausages.

694
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:01,154
We're having a barbecue.

695
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,789
A barbecue?

696
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,831
It keeps you warm, Gerard!

697
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:18,589
Right, I have to warn
the rest of the neighbourhood.

698
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,038
Come, Ricardo.

699
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,959
- Bye, Stefan.
- See you, Gerard.

700
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,154
If we see one of your ostriches,
we'll cook that too.

701
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,033
Good idea.

702
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,635
Kenny!

703
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,435
Kenny, no!

704
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,390
He was on to something,
I swear.

705
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,953
On to what?

706
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:15,832
That there was something
in the trunk.

707
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,075
Yeah, sausages.

708
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:30,474
You can chop him up, Kenny.

709
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,114
Stef!

710
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,155
Dave?

711
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,190
Dave!

712
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:14,475
Fill out this form and I'll...

713
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,994
No need to get upset, sir.

714
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,080
What are you going to say?

715
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,999
The truth.

716
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,989
What do you know
about truth?

717
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,949
Enough.

718
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,991
You really think
you're better than me, brother?

719
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:23,593
All I know, is that I am

720
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:26,435
not like you.

721
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,474
Why didn't you tell me, Dave?

722
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,510
Why didn't you tell me?

723
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,952
That Moroccan wouldn't be dead.

724
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:55,990
What?

725
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:01,756
Did you really think
you could hide something like that?

726
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,354
You have to tell your brother
a thing like that.

727
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,356
It's not possible
to talk to you.

728
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,353
I've been trying

729
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,196
my whole life.

730
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:27,080
Did you listen, even once?

731
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,678
Do you know how it feels,

732
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,353
to be humiliated
by a woman?

733
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,229
No...

734
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:49,919
you don't.

735
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:52,239
She had to do it.

736
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,314
Don't you get that?

737
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,598
There's just no other way

738
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,319
with you.

739
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,159
Because you're crazy.

740
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,149
What?

741
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,193
Are you going to beat me up
in a police station?

742
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,516
Sir, you can
go to the counter now.

743
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,114
You know, Dave...

744
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:31,034
Do what you think you must.

745
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,958
Give us up,
if that's what you want.

746
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,915
Or we sort this out together.

747
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:47,678
As brothers.

748
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,275
And then you're rid of me.

749
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,151
I'll leave you...

750
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,511
and Sylvie in peace.

751
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,072
What's keeping you?

752
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,070
I'm going with Stef to the lab,
to get things ready.

753
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,912
- Lab?
- Those containers.

754
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:23,315
Go get the other guy
with Joyce.

755
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,715
Kenny...

756
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,078
I'll see you later.

757
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,717
It's probably nothing, but...

758
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,238
Go on, he's in there.

759
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:54,709
Sit down.

760
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:26,760
You called me, Kenny.
Don't forget that.

761
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,516
We'll get through this together, pal.

762
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,279
We're brothers.

763
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:43,954
Will he suffer?

764
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,195
Do you like music?

765
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,594
Do you like this?

766
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,751
Let's dance.

767
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:04,276
I like Adamo.
Know his stuff?

768
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,640
Sorry about the mess.

769
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,432
I clean up.

770
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:14,551
Every week.
It's not easy with Stef.

771
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,391
A real pig.
Look where I have to live.

772
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,797
I'm a beautiful woman.
But you're handsome too.

773
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:25,039
Pity...

774
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,190
A real pity.

775
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:39,075
I just wanted
to be a welder.

776
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:45,240
But every time I asked a question,
they sent me into the corridor.

777
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,749
Just because I was having
a bit of trouble

778
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,877
with my ADHD.

779
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:02,951
What they didn't know,
is how intelligent I am.

780
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:09,111
When you're too intelligent,
they think you're dangerous.

781
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,875
Then they're surprised
that you make your own drugs.

782
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,395
Does it surprise you?
Not me.

783
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,559
Joyce is here.

784
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,878
Where's Joyce?

785
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,791
I can explain everything...

786
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:11,909
Kenny, ask your brother
where Joyce is.

787
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:17,875
It was Stef's idea.

788
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,151
I didn't want this, brother.

789
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,752
I didn't want this.

790
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:29,713
Come on, put down that gun.

791
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,118
Did you call the cops?

792
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,439
What the fuck?

793
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,711
- Around 4 p.m.?
- Yes.

794
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,992
Did he say
where he was headed?

795
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,316
To see those men.

796
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:32,550
OK, stay inside.

797
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,678
Sorry, bro'...

798
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,556
What have you done?

799
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,713
She was pregnant!

800
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,517
Police!
Drop your weapon!

801
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:06,640
Drop your weapon!

802
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:10,594
Drop your weapon.
