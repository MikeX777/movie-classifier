1
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:31,554
THE PANDERERS

2
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,480
Yes, a simple dress.

3
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:16,117
Around 8:30.
What is your phone number again?

4
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:20,293
38-18-60

5
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:23,821
Good. Do we agree, then?

6
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:27,605
And remember: be very cheerful.

7
00:01:28,242 --> 00:01:29,628
Bye, dear.

8
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:33,617
She's so sweet...

9
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,781
She has a beautiful voice.

10
00:01:36,605 --> 00:01:39,139
We had so many expenses this week!

11
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,949
Two bands for three evenings...

12
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,015
plus overtime until dawn.

13
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:47,370
12 boxes of champagne,
2 of vodka, a box of caviar...

14
00:01:48,154 --> 00:01:49,748
Everything becomes more and more 
expensive, these days.

15
00:01:49,991 --> 00:01:51,956
Do you want the headlines, Ma'am?

16
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:54,877
No, I've had enough for today.

17
00:01:55,832 --> 00:01:57,934
I wonder where this is going to end...

18
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:01,013
I'll go and check
if everything's in order.

19
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:06,709
This is the first cigarette 
of the day for me.

20
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:12,326
I swear that I won't
have another until midday.

21
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,841
Credito fondiario, 9800...

22
00:02:57,523 --> 00:02:59,932
Mediobanca, 61200...

23
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:03,977
Credito Italiano, 1849.
- What's that?

24
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,352
Credito Italiano, 1849.
- Buy it.

25
00:03:07,574 --> 00:03:09,983
Bank of Rome,
40520.

26
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:12,959
Interbanca, 13900.

27
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:16,334
Italgas, 546.
- Buy it.

28
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,755
Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

29
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,937
Please give me another
two minutes. - There's no hurry.

30
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,834
Assicurazione Italiana,
269000.

31
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:28,425
Assicurazioni Generali,
43200.

32
00:03:28,588 --> 00:03:30,641
What is your weight today, darling?

33
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:33,300
82 kilos and 200 grams, Gilda.

34
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,583
My weight rises, and my shares
fall down in the stock market.

35
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,012
How much was your weight yesterday?

36
00:03:40,112 --> 00:03:43,725
Well, yesterday evening...-
Buy that, too!

37
00:03:43,845 --> 00:03:47,077
I think 80 kilos and almost 700 grams.

38
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:49,845
I've gained more than 1 kilo and 500 grams.

39
00:03:50,174 --> 00:03:53,465
Ah, so you've lost more than
1,5 kilo! - No, I gained them!

40
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:55,983
It's quite a problem, isn't it?
- Not at all...

41
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:58,138
… with the diet
I planned for you,

42
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,087
you'll be back in shape
within a week!

43
00:04:00,187 --> 00:04:01,555
It'll be a little frustrating.

44
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:05,152
Boiled chicken and vegetables,
no bread, neither wine nor alcohol.

45
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:08,358
...and 28 700
- Please repeat, I was distracted.

46
00:04:08,521 --> 00:04:11,653
28 730 at Milan. Yes, Milan.

47
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:16,917
Alright, alright, buy it.
- Buy 144, Finsid 172.

48
00:04:18,246 --> 00:04:20,690
Gym, 2150.

49
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:23,993
Ifi private, 2370.

50
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:26,849
Investimenti, 2290.

51
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:29,690
The Centre, 8704.

52
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:33,967
Pirelli, 1369,
Sici 400.

53
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:37,744
Alright, that will do. Thank you.
- Can I start?

54
00:04:41,717 --> 00:04:44,770
My husband is in your hands.
Please, treat him well!

55
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,082
You are marvellous, darling.

56
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:56,956
Stronger.

57
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:59,209
I'm not made of glass.

58
00:04:59,309 --> 00:05:02,968
Relax. Don't stay so tense,
or the massage won't help.

59
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,772
Going to the end of the world, Miss?

60
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,046
It's number 25. That's there.

61
00:06:04,682 --> 00:06:07,043
How much is it?
- 2000.

62
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:22,682
Who is it?

63
00:06:22,802 --> 00:06:25,196
What's that, "Who is it"?
I'm Odile! Today is friday, right?

64
00:06:25,296 --> 00:06:26,355
Who is Odile?

65
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:28,931
"Who is Odile"?!
I've got an appointment!

66
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:32,770
Listen, send away
the dogs, they frighten me.

67
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:56,046
A strong flavour...
I like it.

68
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,128
How are you going
to call it?

69
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:02,912
Well, me and my wife
have decided

70
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:05,208
not to use
exotic names anymore.

71
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:09,270
We'll baptise my cocktails
with the names of our friends,

72
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,171
of those who frequent our house.

73
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,250
this one here, mon cher,

74
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:16,272
is my latest creation.

75
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:18,496
one of those that
turned out best.

76
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:21,611
I couldn't help giving it your name.

77
00:07:21,953 --> 00:07:24,197
"Cocktail Aldo Brando"

78
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,821
I always break the glass
when I drink.

79
00:07:31,078 --> 00:07:33,610
I'd do it in war, too.
It always amused me.

80
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,792
In war, I've always been
with people who smashed glasses.

81
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,212
Davide, have you got some interesting news?

82
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:44,125
We've always been here,
even during our holidays

83
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:48,103
Naturally, we see many people
and time passes by.

84
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:52,203
I want to show you
my latest acquisitions...

85
00:07:52,303 --> 00:07:54,322
for my personal museum.

86
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:56,260
It's very interesting.

87
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:05,907
I always thought that
women were totems...

88
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:07,425
cruel,

89
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:09,564
menacing, dark..

90
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:12,383
a totem that must...

91
00:08:12,503 --> 00:08:14,870
be destroyed.

92
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,596
Yes.
Women are there to be punished.

93
00:08:18,724 --> 00:08:20,737
A woman has to be punished

94
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:22,803
because she's the
intermediary between us

95
00:08:23,553 --> 00:08:26,058
and the diabolical forces
of the universe.

96
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:29,350
The body of a woman
is a form which gives us life,

97
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,610
something enigmatic...

98
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,430
which, at times,
seems about to reveal...

99
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,226
a distant and unknown land.

100
00:08:37,326 --> 00:08:41,464
I've always wondered what
the nude body of a woman means.

101
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:44,073
I believe it forms
part of a true language.

102
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:46,248
It's not actually a language.

103
00:08:46,348 --> 00:08:50,814
Rather, it's silence, nothingness.
- It's silence for those who are deaf.

104
00:08:51,076 --> 00:08:55,114
For those who are born dead...

105
00:08:55,348 --> 00:08:57,871
for all those who don't
have space in the universe.

106
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,730
Why do I have to
dress myself up this time?

107
00:09:27,287 --> 00:09:32,128
Well, contrary to you, I think that it's
important to know the universe well.

108
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,466
The landscapes speak,

109
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,595
have a soul.

110
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:40,965
I've traveled a lot,
especially in the Far East.

111
00:09:41,174 --> 00:09:42,730
Is the girl here

112
00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:45,063
Yes, she's ready for you.

113
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:48,162
Does she meet the
requirements we'd agreed on?

114
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:50,276
Yes, all of them,
don't worry, Aldo Brando.

115
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:54,395
We chose her carefully.

116
00:09:55,901 --> 00:09:57,935
Go and embark
on this new journey!

117
00:09:58,174 --> 00:10:00,210
Odile is expecting you.

118
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:09,283
But how did women
dress in 1954?

119
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:48,046
But what're you doing?
Look, I can walk myself!

120
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,524
Come on, leave me be!
Put me down! I say, put me down!

121
00:10:51,644 --> 00:10:53,246
Phew!

122
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:55,764
I want to carry you.

123
00:11:01,789 --> 00:11:03,719
The other one too, Odile.

124
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:12,051
Watch it...

125
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:16,595
Perfect!

126
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,989
Why did you bring me here?

127
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:25,972
What's all this supposed to mean?

128
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,961
Look, they might
see us up here, you know?

129
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,870
It's my little theatre.
Don't ask questions.

130
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,259
You just have to obey,
and that's it.

131
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:42,750
Yeah yeah, I'll obey.
But we have to make it quick.

132
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:45,528
So, what do I have to do?

133
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,744
I'll tell you now.

134
00:11:51,914 --> 00:11:54,383
You're very nice, you know?

135
00:11:54,937 --> 00:11:56,545
Don't talk nonsense.

136
00:11:56,937 --> 00:11:58,761
What do you know about me?

137
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:02,657
I'm not of the nice kind...
but neither depraved.

138
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:05,431
For me it's all or nothing.

139
00:12:06,732 --> 00:12:08,414
I'm just...

140
00:12:08,857 --> 00:12:10,664
a torturer.

141
00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:12,520
Nothing more.

142
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:15,369
Look, if you threaten me,
I'll get out of here.

143
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:19,268
You can do everything to me,
everything you want...

144
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:21,520
but you mustn't hurt me,
is that clear?

145
00:12:22,766 --> 00:12:26,422
For me, my next one is
nothing but an object of torture.

146
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:28,615
You think I'm sick, eh?

147
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,716
Go on, say it!

148
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,121
Nobody knows that I'm like that.

149
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:39,824
They never found out because
in all these years of occasional love,

150
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,350
I managed to
camouflage myself.

151
00:12:44,553 --> 00:12:48,095
I tried to be
like the others, too.

152
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,134
I didn't manage to.

153
00:12:58,053 --> 00:12:59,844
Maybe, this time....

154
00:13:00,245 --> 00:13:02,432
is my last occasion.

155
00:13:04,098 --> 00:13:05,710
Look here, it's loaded.

156
00:13:05,926 --> 00:13:09,308
It's enought to pull here...
and <i>Bang!</i>  it fires...

157
00:13:09,972 --> 00:13:12,008
Do you want to know
how many wars I've been in?

158
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:13,328
Algeria,

159
00:13:13,574 --> 00:13:15,353
foreign legion.

160
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:17,869
Madagascar...

161
00:13:19,369 --> 00:13:20,767
Indonesia...

162
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:27,450
I was a mercenary and dealer of arms.

163
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,664
The risk excites me,
I can't help it.

164
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:33,304
Now I'm rich
and respectable.

165
00:13:33,495 --> 00:13:34,907
You're afraid of me?

166
00:13:35,007 --> 00:13:36,778
Don't be.
It's pointless.

167
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:40,386
Of course,
my criminal record is clean.

168
00:13:40,604 --> 00:13:45,243
Because in this filthy world,
a clean criminal record has to be paid.

169
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,217
Where are you going,
stupid chicken?

170
00:13:47,317 --> 00:13:49,942
Watch out, don't crush
my soldiers. Look at them...

171
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,709
look at them well...

172
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,777
because they represent
my lost dreams.

173
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,975
You see, I would've liked
to be commander...

174
00:13:58,075 --> 00:14:00,145
in an official army.

175
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:02,961
A real commander!
Yes, it's like that...

176
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,893
However,

177
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:07,973
all the official armies
considered me...

178
00:14:08,245 --> 00:14:09,877
nothing but a deserter.

179
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:11,692
But you won't!

180
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:13,839
You have to respect me,
you know?

181
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:16,950
I'm at your disposal.
That's what I'm paid for.

182
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,450
But you mustn't hurt me!

183
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:20,507
So?

184
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,405
Do you still think I'm nice?

185
00:14:22,632 --> 00:14:24,109
Where are you going?
Stay here!

186
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:26,666
With each slap I'm giving you
I'm getting more excited.

187
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:29,845
But don't call me
by my surname, you hear me?

188
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,689
Call me "professor"!

189
00:14:31,886 --> 00:14:33,935
Or rather, "commander"!

190
00:14:34,984 --> 00:14:38,003
In that case <i>you</i> have to
adress me as "Miss"...

191
00:14:38,234 --> 00:14:40,498
actually, as "Miss Odile"...

192
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,791
and besides...
I hate soldiers!

193
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:46,251
Even tin ones!

194
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,291
I know your story.

195
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:51,234
North africa, 1954.

196
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,052
Messer-Kabir.

197
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,098
They wanted your mother
to reveal the names of her comrades.

198
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:58,241
How do you know that?

199
00:14:59,006 --> 00:15:01,400
Back then,
you hadn't been born yet.

200
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:06,610
You were born later...

201
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:12,579
when your mother was reduced
to a mere shadow of herself...

202
00:15:12,837 --> 00:15:16,490
because of the tortures
they inflicted on her.

203
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,893
Nobody must talk to me
about this anymore.

204
00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:22,888
Besides, how do you know?
Who told you?

205
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,398
Our host.

206
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:31,362
You've been chosen
very carefully, Odile.

207
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,120
Most of all...

208
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:37,575
because there was
that story behind you,

209
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:42,221
I needed you...

210
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:45,069
to be born from torture.

211
00:15:45,313 --> 00:15:48,058
because I enjoy myself
this way...

212
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:53,415
I like girls who had an unhappy childhood,

213
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:56,131
disgraced girls.

214
00:15:57,145 --> 00:15:58,784
I enjoy thinking about...

215
00:15:58,884 --> 00:16:01,498
the tortures your poor mom...

216
00:16:01,804 --> 00:16:03,793
had to endure.

217
00:16:06,157 --> 00:16:07,862
It was part of the deal.

218
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:11,089
Let's make love at once.

219
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,608
Hold on to me tight.

220
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:23,938
That way, you can't fall.

221
00:16:24,207 --> 00:16:27,389
But if you let go of me,
you'll get smashed.

222
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,558
I was born later.
I don't know what they did to her.

223
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:38,838
We'll catch up
on that subject soon.

224
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:41,258
But don't worry now.

225
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,426
Let's play!

226
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:47,460
Let's play again, Odile.

227
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,650
I'm dying to play with you.

228
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,378
You know, those who say
"Make love, not war" make me laugh.

229
00:16:54,498 --> 00:16:56,362
I don't see the difference.

230
00:16:56,787 --> 00:16:58,639
Conquer the hill!

231
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:02,525
The third division conquers the back...

232
00:17:03,754 --> 00:17:06,209
Marching on is becoming
more and more difficult.

233
00:17:06,457 --> 00:17:09,076
The objective is finally conquered.

234
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,528
Now...

235
00:17:11,628 --> 00:17:14,435
I'm the one giving the orders!

236
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,975
You crushed all my soldiers
once again!

237
00:17:17,673 --> 00:17:20,404
I'll punish you...
now.

238
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:27,247
I had almost forgotten her.

239
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,975
Well, not exactly.
Not forgotten.

240
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:33,592
You don't forget certain things.

241
00:17:34,824 --> 00:17:37,821
and then, I thought that...

242
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,455
Anyway, it's useless thinking about it,
when you can't do anything about it.

243
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,665
And then... you show up...

244
00:17:45,785 --> 00:17:49,446
asking me all these questions
to which I never knew the answers.

245
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:53,960
What they've done to her...
and why...

246
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:59,292
I... I...
I don't know much...

247
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,306
I just know that...

248
00:18:01,692 --> 00:18:04,490
that she had six broken ribs...

249
00:18:05,398 --> 00:18:08,396
and then... they burned her all over.

250
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:11,169
They pulled out her teeth.

251
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:13,165
The names.

252
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:16,585
They wanted to know the names.
- The names?

253
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:19,984
What names? I don't know them,
I don't know anybody!

254
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:23,746
You've responded like her.
- And you? How do you know?

255
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:25,865
I was told the whole story.

256
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,785
Wait a second...

257
00:18:35,676 --> 00:18:37,444
I'll show you...

258
00:18:38,345 --> 00:18:41,342
They used electricity on her body...

259
00:18:41,626 --> 00:18:44,202
they made her feel it here...

260
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:47,764
and here, all the way
to the navel, like this!

261
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:57,770
But... who told you all this?

262
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,110
You didn't do anything
to prevent it, to defend her.

263
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:03,759
Your mother was beautiful...

264
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:06,089
Maybe she resembled you.

265
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:10,201
Her torturer wanted to know
the names, always the names.

266
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:12,852
But your mother was too beautiful...

267
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:18,334
even if she had talked,
he would've raped her anyway.

268
00:19:18,586 --> 00:19:21,337
But who was that man?
You met him...

269
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:24,256
I want to know who he was.
I want to know.

270
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:27,229
They made her sit
in an armchair...

271
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:31,930
a special armchair
with two clamps at the arms.

272
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,976
Then they asked for the names,
always the names...

273
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:38,295
Then that man switched
on an extremely strong light.

274
00:19:38,857 --> 00:19:40,478
Blinding,

275
00:19:40,578 --> 00:19:43,403
directly in the eyes!
- Who was it?

276
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:45,103
Tell me who it was.

277
00:19:45,223 --> 00:19:48,135
I want to know who it was.
- I won't tell you who he was...

278
00:19:49,277 --> 00:19:50,892
but what he did.

279
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:52,766
No...

280
00:19:53,213 --> 00:19:56,047
what I'm thinking
can't be true...

281
00:19:56,682 --> 00:19:59,878
Why do you, of all people,
know that story?

282
00:20:00,703 --> 00:20:02,670
Why you?

283
00:20:04,722 --> 00:20:08,246
I always felt strangely attracted
to these things: torture,

284
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:10,016
documents,

285
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:11,772
memoirs...

286
00:20:12,574 --> 00:20:14,705
That's where I find pleasure.

287
00:20:14,939 --> 00:20:17,246
Who tortured my mother?

288
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:19,368
Was it you?

289
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:22,719
No.
It wasn't me.

290
00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:26,796
I even couldn't say
who told me this story.

291
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,092
If that really is the truth...

292
00:20:30,212 --> 00:20:34,002
why did you ask to meet me?
Why did you want to see me?

293
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:35,670
Take it!

294
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,515
It was meant for you
from the beginning.

295
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,657
You'll say
that I killed myself.

296
00:20:57,315 --> 00:20:59,673
Don't be afraid!
I wrote it down.

297
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:04,751
There's a letter
in the pocket of my jacket.

298
00:21:04,851 --> 00:21:07,589
Little blood and little noise.

299
00:21:08,755 --> 00:21:10,488
It's simple, isn't it?

300
00:21:21,144 --> 00:21:25,011
But one day or another,
I'll get myself killed for real,

301
00:21:25,111 --> 00:21:27,180
once I find the courage.

302
00:21:39,743 --> 00:21:41,390
Excuse me, my dear,

303
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:45,255
but we have many guests tonight,
many nice people.

304
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:54,771
And besides, by now I can't really
rely on servants anymore.

305
00:21:54,871 --> 00:21:58,953
You're right, Gilda. These days,
you can't really trust anyone.

306
00:22:03,786 --> 00:22:05,075
There you are, ma'am.

307
00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:09,884
I have to think
about everything.

308
00:22:10,707 --> 00:22:13,811
Our rooms mustn't look
like ordinary rooms anymore...

309
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:17,520
they should look like theatres, 
like paintings of illusion.

310
00:22:18,223 --> 00:22:21,061
Can a secretary
or a room maid achieve this?

311
00:22:21,161 --> 00:22:23,413
No, certainly not, Gilda.

312
00:22:23,806 --> 00:22:26,831
Every little detail
has to be taken care of.

313
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,999
And that's your task.

314
00:22:29,937 --> 00:22:33,310
Who are we celebrating tonight?
- Well, there's Marcantonio...

315
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:35,721
and there's Giampiero.
Marcantonio is a little sad.

316
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,066
He's worried about
the oil company, isn't he?

317
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:41,850
You know, he believed Ennio
was here too, but it's too risky.

318
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,971
So I told him that there were
problems with the airplane.

319
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:49,439
And the judge has come?

320
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:51,721
Yes, but he's unbearable this time

321
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:54,811
He wants to be punished,
wants to suffer.

322
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,657
We'll never have a whip
heavy enough for him.

323
00:22:57,757 --> 00:23:00,133
Yes, his crying and whimpering is unbearable...

324
00:23:00,341 --> 00:23:03,500
Ah, they are just crocodile tears.

325
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:07,507
I feel more sorry for him than for the
innocents he keeps sentencing to prison.

326
00:23:07,607 --> 00:23:09,657
But a lawman might
come in handy.

327
00:23:11,175 --> 00:23:13,880
There's a call from Paris
for you, Count.

328
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:16,834
Yes?

329
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,392
Yes. I already told you
this morning

330
00:23:22,492 --> 00:23:25,374
that I neither want
nor can do anything for you.

331
00:23:25,985 --> 00:23:27,836
I already said no.

332
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:34,548
Who was it?
- Oh...

333
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:43,208
Tomorrow, I absolutely
have to find a tall girl,

334
00:23:43,477 --> 00:23:46,536
with olive-coloured skin,

335
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:48,508
and slender like a sail.

336
00:23:48,723 --> 00:23:50,706
Ginevra asked for it,
you know.

337
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:53,104
She called me
this morning from Milan.

338
00:23:53,204 --> 00:23:56,104
She was quite upset,
she begged me!

339
00:23:56,753 --> 00:23:58,826
Ginevra?
- Yes!

340
00:23:59,964 --> 00:24:03,619
It was her who bought
all shares of Finter.

341
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:05,269
Very well.

342
00:24:05,852 --> 00:24:08,524
It's a precious relation, dear.

343
00:24:09,288 --> 00:24:11,160
Don't neglect it, it's important.

344
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,900
You must try
to keep her satisfied.

345
00:24:15,095 --> 00:24:18,499
Yes, I might have
two or three suitable girls...

346
00:24:21,658 --> 00:24:23,874
but it will be very difficult, darling.

347
00:24:32,008 --> 00:24:35,112
Polish this vase well,
the humidity has ruined it.

348
00:24:35,295 --> 00:24:38,843
"You don't have eyes to see"
as the Gospel says.

349
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:41,765
Oh Davide, don't be stupid...

350
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:44,216
It's you!
I can't believe it!

351
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,644
I think you'd do better
not believing it...

352
00:24:47,504 --> 00:24:49,575
my beautiful panderess.

353
00:24:49,675 --> 00:24:52,308
My lurid, splendid panderess.

354
00:24:52,966 --> 00:24:56,467
Why at this hour? - If not in the
morning, when do you want me to come?

355
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,667
The rehearsals
at the theatre will start at 2 PM.

356
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:01,524
I don't want the actresses
in my bed, you know?

357
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:03,244
Forbidden flesh.

358
00:25:03,344 --> 00:25:06,258
Meat for the audience.
Good for the public...

359
00:25:06,358 --> 00:25:11,441
for the critics, for the projectors...
and for the “protectors” [pimps], of course.

360
00:25:12,492 --> 00:25:15,821
Did you put on the coloured garters
like I told you to?

361
00:25:27,265 --> 00:25:30,222
Alright like this, master?
- Alright.

362
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,393
Crab red, as you wished.

363
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:36,791
Is something wrong?
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

364
00:25:37,004 --> 00:25:40,175
They're also wearing
bone corsets.

365
00:25:40,275 --> 00:25:44,034
Yeah, it's so Berlinian whorehouse,
late 19th century, Brecht.

366
00:25:44,134 --> 00:25:46,892
Or the drawings by Grosz.
- "Panderess"...

367
00:25:46,992 --> 00:25:49,130
I thought you talked
more elegantly.

368
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,882
Panderess is an elegant word - it means
supplying love by making strangers meet.

369
00:25:52,982 --> 00:25:55,884
In the theatre I'm elegant but with you,
I'm calling things by their name.

370
00:25:55,984 --> 00:25:58,840
Finally a bit of freedom! Come come,
show me my mammella!

371
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,899
My tit, the right one,
come on, go ahead!

372
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:04,971
Madame...
- Giorgio!

373
00:26:10,993 --> 00:26:13,649
Show me all the photographs, quick!

374
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:16,682
I have no time to waste.
- Right away, master!

375
00:26:17,102 --> 00:26:18,643
You two, push!

376
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,346
You see, Giorgio...

377
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:24,366
there are no new recruits
to show you on photographs.

378
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,105
You already know all of my girls.

379
00:26:26,205 --> 00:26:28,995
But in one and a half months,
I think I'll have some new ones,

380
00:26:29,095 --> 00:26:31,065
from Tunisia or Baltimore.

381
00:26:31,165 --> 00:26:32,941
Well, let's go.

382
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:34,846
Let's make it quick.

383
00:26:44,593 --> 00:26:46,887
See that one?
She's an introvert, shy girl

384
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:50,103
She plays hard to get. First,
she flees from you, but then...

385
00:26:50,203 --> 00:26:53,391
she always returns on her hands
and knees. Sweet, isn't she?

386
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:56,071
Who's that smart one here?
I don't think I've ever seen her.

387
00:26:56,267 --> 00:26:59,502
This blonde paints herself badly.
Why does she have to put on make up?

388
00:26:59,602 --> 00:27:02,807
How old is she, 15, 16 years?
- No, 32 for you, Giorgio.

389
00:27:02,907 --> 00:27:05,080
I always want to
tell you the truth.

390
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,264
But the others
are the age they look.

391
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:08,978
Company secretary.

392
00:27:09,152 --> 00:27:11,193
Horrendous.
And this one?

393
00:27:11,293 --> 00:27:14,101
This one's alright.
I'd even say she's splendid.

394
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:17,825
Slender neck... employee?
Or maybe clerk?

395
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:19,872
Duchess. Do you want her?

396
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:23,592
She's very expensive though.
500 000 for one weekend.

397
00:27:24,496 --> 00:27:28,999
See? This girl is a student.

398
00:27:30,095 --> 00:27:33,669
She lives in the country
but attends university in Rome.

399
00:27:34,338 --> 00:27:37,081
She doesn't like young ones,
she finds them insignificant.

400
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,942
She rather loves men
the age of her father.

401
00:27:41,134 --> 00:27:42,523
Old gentlemen.

402
00:27:42,623 --> 00:27:44,089
Babysitter...

403
00:27:44,436 --> 00:27:47,394
This one works as a clerk,
secretary...

404
00:27:47,494 --> 00:27:51,378
She has a degree in chemistry.
- Professor of natural sciences.

405
00:27:54,815 --> 00:27:58,270
Daddy's daughter,
mummy's daughter, stewardess...

406
00:27:58,516 --> 00:28:01,662
Ah, this one here is
absolutely irresistible, fabulous!

407
00:28:01,762 --> 00:28:04,215
She likes a lot to hang out
with young ones who have little...

408
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,872
well, who aren't anybody,

409
00:28:07,196 --> 00:28:09,685
who pay for love
with daddy's money.

410
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:13,393
Her! There she is,
that's the one I want.

411
00:28:14,376 --> 00:28:16,841
Yes, no problem.
You can have her.

412
00:28:17,032 --> 00:28:21,054
It's just that I'd need some time
to inform her, you see?

413
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:23,881
Alright.
But I want her!

414
00:28:24,076 --> 00:28:27,858
Yes, but when?
- Sunday, at 7.

415
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:30,500
In the evening?
- No, at dawn.

416
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,758
A Malaysian dawn.

417
00:28:32,858 --> 00:28:35,665
Conrad, Rimbaud, as well as Salgari.

418
00:28:35,765 --> 00:28:39,430
She's the daughter of the chief
of a tribe of headhunters...

419
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,626
that way we're
closer to Melville.

420
00:28:41,726 --> 00:28:45,923
and I'm Al Mayer,
the outcast of the islands.

421
00:28:48,472 --> 00:28:52,158
Now it's up to you. You have to do
all you can to give him the tropics.

422
00:28:52,258 --> 00:28:56,369
Our circle is getting used up. Odile,
the stewardess, the usual 2 or 3 wives

423
00:28:56,469 --> 00:29:00,466
who want to buy themselves
a fur coat or a colour TV set,

424
00:29:00,566 --> 00:29:02,760
as well as some failed actresses.

425
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,745
What do you think?

426
00:29:06,067 --> 00:29:07,770
What do I think?

427
00:29:08,843 --> 00:29:11,238
I believe in your
fervent imagination.

428
00:29:11,453 --> 00:29:16,136
I'd like to have a group
of faithful girls here.

429
00:29:17,023 --> 00:29:20,082
They should be very compliant,
absolutely innocuous.

430
00:29:20,317 --> 00:29:21,912
Like these ducks.

431
00:29:22,446 --> 00:29:26,365
I'd like to be able to
fondle them, to caress them.

432
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,012
warm them up.

433
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,304
I desire a young one,

434
00:29:32,765 --> 00:29:34,379
healthy and new

435
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:36,690
tender like a roasted chestnut.

436
00:29:36,964 --> 00:29:38,272
But...

437
00:29:39,684 --> 00:29:41,971
you don't have one
like that, do you?

438
00:29:42,296 --> 00:29:43,921
I thought of it.

439
00:29:44,212 --> 00:29:47,839
Giusy and her collaborators
will take care of it.

440
00:30:00,403 --> 00:30:01,815
Water!

441
00:30:03,148 --> 00:30:04,677
Dry...

442
00:30:12,347 --> 00:30:14,241
Go away! Away!

443
00:30:15,137 --> 00:30:17,277
Go away, beasts!

444
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,612
Water!

445
00:30:28,158 --> 00:30:30,298
Water! Water! Yes!

446
00:30:52,407 --> 00:30:54,995
Who are you,
Stranger?

447
00:30:55,543 --> 00:30:57,202
Co... the commander of...

448
00:31:02,185 --> 00:31:03,956
Tell me!
Tell me who you are.

449
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:07,530
I'm...
I'm Commander Al Mayer.

450
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,846
I was in command
of the "Narcissus".

451
00:31:09,946 --> 00:31:11,700
An armed battleship of 600 tons.

452
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,117
We were heading for Aden, loaded...

453
00:31:14,217 --> 00:31:16,650
with guano and a thousand
muslim pilgrims on their way to Mecca.

454
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:21,364
One night a terrible typhoon, 
characteristic of those areas after all,

455
00:31:21,661 --> 00:31:24,031
dismasted the ship,
we lowered the boats,

456
00:31:24,131 --> 00:31:26,277
and I was the first one
to leave the ship,

457
00:31:26,377 --> 00:31:28,512
me, the commander,
you understand?

458
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:31,829
A hundread days at sea!
We had to fight with the sharks

459
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:33,280
over human flesh.

460
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,305
I myself devoured three pilgrims
and half of the boatswain.

461
00:31:36,405 --> 00:31:38,636
I left the other half
to the second commander.

462
00:31:39,078 --> 00:31:42,395
So you... you understand
my language, my child!

463
00:31:42,495 --> 00:31:45,957
No.
We've never seen a white man.

464
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:48,821
A white man...
I'm not anymore.

465
00:31:48,921 --> 00:31:51,952
I used to be but I'm not anymore.
Take me to your village.

466
00:31:52,052 --> 00:31:55,504
But we are headhunters!
- Very well, so I'll lose my head, too.

467
00:31:55,604 --> 00:31:58,669
I already lost everything:
my ship, my honour...

468
00:31:58,769 --> 00:32:00,428
But we eat nothing but berries.

469
00:32:00,528 --> 00:32:04,470
Very well... oh, excellent.
Do you also have bread trees? - Sure.

470
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,392
Fantastic!
- We have apple trees, too.

471
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:10,829
And cocoa plants.
- Enough, otherwise I'll gain weight!

472
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,765
But what's that medallion doing
on the Molucca islands? - It's St. Anthony...

473
00:32:15,865 --> 00:32:21,230
That won't do, you're too sophisticated.
You're not natural, it won't do.

474
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,267
Ah, there it is, the village.

475
00:32:28,253 --> 00:32:30,236
Cereus Candelabrus. Very good.

476
00:32:30,336 --> 00:32:32,791
We live here.
It's very small.

477
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:38,070
But as it suits us, you can enter.
My two husbands are out hunting.

478
00:32:39,002 --> 00:32:40,414
We're alone.

479
00:32:40,514 --> 00:32:43,081
My other three husbands
are in war...

480
00:32:45,195 --> 00:32:48,019
and my parents have gone head-cutting.
- And what's that?

481
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,806
Seanut.

482
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:53,475
The symbol of fertility.

483
00:32:53,705 --> 00:32:57,259
But you'll be hungry and thirsty!
- I'll eat some head later.

484
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:59,399
For now, give me
something to drink.

485
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:01,432
I'll give you milk.

486
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,926
And that? What's that?
Champagne?

487
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:08,595
Is this a joke? Champagne
at the Moluccas? Put it away!

488
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,968
Come on, drink.

489
00:33:11,828 --> 00:33:14,887
There, have some as well.
Come on! Like that...

490
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:17,214
No, wait...
from your hands.

491
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:19,430
There...

492
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,895
and now lick it,
like a goat...

493
00:33:21,995 --> 00:33:23,707
Like that.
Very good.

494
00:33:23,807 --> 00:33:25,634
Like a goat.

495
00:33:28,597 --> 00:33:30,177
Yes, like this.
Very good.

496
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:32,575
And now, a moment of rhythm.

497
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:34,533
Yes...

498
00:33:56,575 --> 00:34:00,516
You're like a papaya plant,
like a piston of corn,

499
00:34:00,616 --> 00:34:04,356
or buckwheat.
you're wild, you're primitive,

500
00:34:04,754 --> 00:34:08,003
You are primordial!
Something that transcends me!

501
00:34:08,303 --> 00:34:09,704
You are...

502
00:34:09,984 --> 00:34:11,642
you are obsessive!

503
00:34:11,742 --> 00:34:14,676
You are the tropic,
you are...

504
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,899
you are like the earth,
that's what you are!

505
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:31,710
I want to be your earth,
your god, your river!

506
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,637
Your sacred area.

507
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:38,749
Your feet stepping on me
will evoke the great ghosts! Yes...

508
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:40,836
come, dance on me!

509
00:34:40,936 --> 00:34:45,878
Together, we'll pass
the great river Nagaroa.

510
00:34:45,978 --> 00:34:47,558
Yes, like that.

511
00:34:47,658 --> 00:34:50,791
What are you doing?
Do you think you're in a night club?

512
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:53,637
You have to be
more archaic, more African.

513
00:34:53,737 --> 00:34:55,513
more primitive.

514
00:34:56,284 --> 00:34:58,726
Alright, I'll be more African.

515
00:35:09,634 --> 00:35:12,940
Excuse me, dear, but your singing
has a hypnotic effect on me.

516
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,824
But it's the Song of the River!
- Yes, but why exactly now?

517
00:35:17,234 --> 00:35:20,192
When our people fall in love
with someone, they do this:

518
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:21,858
Go ahead, act, Silvia!

519
00:35:21,958 --> 00:35:23,629
What splendour,

520
00:35:23,729 --> 00:35:28,584
that is still in your garments,
it is the bosom that brings relief.

521
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:32,015
What sweetness...
- "While"...

522
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:34,519
"While?"
- "While you undress..."

523
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:37,323
There, go ahead
and read if you forgot.

524
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:41,307
"While she undresses,
my teeth will bite her."

525
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:44,676
Yes... but it doesn't go well
recited like that, Silvia.

526
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,687
You need to interpret
and mimick more.

527
00:35:46,787 --> 00:35:49,679
I have to mimick?
- Exactly. Poetry lives from animation.

528
00:35:49,779 --> 00:35:51,528
What sweetness...

529
00:35:51,982 --> 00:35:56,878
while she undresses,
my teeth bite her.

530
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,862
What are you doing?

531
00:35:59,142 --> 00:36:02,725
Her saliva is like melt honey -

532
00:36:02,825 --> 00:36:05,938
blessed is he
who may sack on her.

533
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:08,269
"Suck on her", ignorant!

534
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:15,515
Her breasts resemble
the eggs of the cutrix.

535
00:36:15,615 --> 00:36:18,339
A bird characteristic for the Savannah.

536
00:36:18,907 --> 00:36:22,336
They,
lovers who warm themselves up.

537
00:36:22,823 --> 00:36:26,722
While you have
let loose your hair...

538
00:36:30,145 --> 00:36:32,330
Ah, yes, finally I'm tied up!

539
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:35,386
Deep down, I've always hated freedom.
I won't be a director anymore,

540
00:36:35,486 --> 00:36:39,339
never again will these
marvellous hands magically move

541
00:36:39,439 --> 00:36:44,454
and guide the actors. Yes, torture me,
degrade me, tell me I'm pathetic!

542
00:36:44,554 --> 00:36:46,510
You're worse than De Lullo.

543
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:49,030
Yes, punish me,
punish me!

544
00:36:49,229 --> 00:36:53,515
You're nothing compared to Enriquez!
- My god, how cruel you are!

545
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:56,367
Even Albertazzi is much better
than you at directing!

546
00:36:56,467 --> 00:37:00,781
No, not Albertazzi!
You're tremendous!

547
00:37:01,395 --> 00:37:03,333
If Vito Molinari did Brecht,

548
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:06,767
he'd do it much better than you!
- No, don't say that. Not Molinari!

549
00:37:06,867 --> 00:37:10,761
You mustn't mention that name!
You're too cruel a woman!

550
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,924
And now, I need
to give you some news.

551
00:37:13,024 --> 00:37:14,871
Oh god, please don't!
I'm afraid of news!

552
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:18,815
Don't tell me. I don't want to know
the news. - I'll tell you all the same!

553
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:22,305
You were hoping to direct
“Galileus” at San Mignato... - Yes.

554
00:37:22,571 --> 00:37:25,070
You won't.

555
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,909
Tell me!
- Sandro Bolchi will do it.

556
00:37:34,403 --> 00:37:38,083
I could never make love
with a mediocre director like you.

557
00:37:38,705 --> 00:37:40,481
You are a zero.

558
00:37:40,697 --> 00:37:44,025
I love successful men.
- Tremendous!

559
00:37:44,251 --> 00:37:47,355
A director who doesn't know how to
direct, does not know how to make love.

560
00:37:47,455 --> 00:37:49,798
Hmm, very refined,
very cruel!

561
00:37:50,257 --> 00:37:52,338
“Sorrisi e Canzoni”...
[popular Italian magazine]

562
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:56,765
never even published a picture of you.
- But how... where did you get all this?

563
00:37:56,865 --> 00:37:58,997
I'll never be yours.

564
00:37:59,608 --> 00:38:02,224
I'll only be
Sandro Bolchi's lover.

565
00:38:04,714 --> 00:38:07,154
It's deep in the night.
It's cold.

566
00:38:07,254 --> 00:38:08,958
It's very humid.

567
00:38:09,459 --> 00:38:11,160
The beasts howl and I...

568
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,199
I'm afraid.

569
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:15,507
Yes. I'm afraid, too.
Yes, come...

570
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:19,235
Come, it's cold...
let's protect ourselves...

571
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:21,608
together...

572
00:38:23,473 --> 00:38:26,129
You're my mum.
Be my mum...

573
00:38:26,955 --> 00:38:29,067
my African mommy.

574
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:32,538
What's that scream? Perhaps
the buffalos that come to drink?

575
00:38:32,638 --> 00:38:34,975
No, they're my husbands,
returning from the hunt.

576
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:37,224
Let's make love quickly then!

577
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,821
Maybe, they are giraffes,
chased by a ferocious lion!

578
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:48,003
No. It's my parents,  they are
returning from the forest with heads.

579
00:38:48,103 --> 00:38:50,087
Let's make love quickly then!

580
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:55,995
No, it's an antelope,
chased by an onza...

581
00:38:56,095 --> 00:38:59,188
a wild cat typical for South America!
- No, it's my tribe.

582
00:38:59,288 --> 00:39:01,691
It's my tribe making war.

583
00:39:02,429 --> 00:39:05,532
Yes... yes, come on,
come on...

584
00:39:05,632 --> 00:39:08,597
Nonsense! It's not a tribe,
it's an ambulance!

585
00:39:11,812 --> 00:39:14,309
So, did I perform well?
Are you pleased?

586
00:39:14,409 --> 00:39:17,826
Can I have a role in your “Galileus”?
- "Galileus"? Let's not exaggerate.

587
00:39:17,926 --> 00:39:21,440
You're gracious and pretty
but too primitive, understand?

588
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:25,280
Too crude, too archaic.
You lack culture...

589
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,098
and class as well.

590
00:39:28,198 --> 00:39:31,303
Anyway, come to my dressing room
after the play.

591
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:34,700
Let's see if we can combine
something, a little tryout,

592
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,457
a test, something.
Okay?

593
00:39:37,557 --> 00:39:40,168
Bye, honey, bye.

594
00:39:57,824 --> 00:40:00,759
Hi Gilda!
- Hi! I see you're well.

595
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,922
What a wonderful dog!

596
00:40:05,244 --> 00:40:08,325
Liv, how was the weather in Singapore?
- Oh, don't talk about it!

597
00:40:08,425 --> 00:40:11,258
43 grades in the shade.
It was hell.

598
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:13,642
But with the air conditoning
in the hotels,

599
00:40:13,742 --> 00:40:16,062
I felt in Paradise.

600
00:40:16,955 --> 00:40:19,056
I brought you a little gift.

601
00:40:19,303 --> 00:40:22,149
I don't know if you'll like it,
it's not easy picking a gift for you...

602
00:40:22,249 --> 00:40:25,319
you already have it all.
It's one of the rarest herbs.

603
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:28,539
Perfect, of first-rate quality!

604
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:31,396
How much do I owe you, Liv?
- You didn't understand, it's a gift!

605
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:34,903
In Singapore they sell it in public,
even in front of the cathedral.

606
00:40:35,003 --> 00:40:38,763
I remembered your name-day is in
a couple of days. The 22nd, isn't it?

607
00:40:38,863 --> 00:40:40,452
Unfortunately it's my birthday.

608
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:43,216
You're as crazy as usual,
but that's why I like you so much.

609
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:47,396
Listen, I've had your usual room
prepared, Liv. Did you know that José...

610
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:57,102
These cocktails prepone my death.

611
00:40:57,202 --> 00:40:58,881
But the story...

612
00:40:58,981 --> 00:41:01,883
I'm writing about them
secures me immortality.

613
00:41:01,983 --> 00:41:05,006
What about the book
you've been writing all these years?

614
00:41:05,106 --> 00:41:08,846
It's almost done. In a couple
of years, my work will be finished.

615
00:41:08,946 --> 00:41:12,233
I just have to study in depth
some Chinese and Japanese herbs.

616
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:14,692
As long as I haven't finished
my research,

617
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:17,258
I won't send even
the first chapter to my editor.

618
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:18,905
I'll certainly travel to Asia,

619
00:41:19,005 --> 00:41:21,479
to find certain rare,
aphrodisiac roots

620
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,515
and others that maintain youth.

621
00:41:24,095 --> 00:41:26,381
You keep on underlining
the fact that you're old...

622
00:41:26,481 --> 00:41:30,084
but you know you'll be
eternally young among famous men

623
00:41:30,566 --> 00:41:34,387
My name will be remembered
for this formidable encyclopedia

624
00:41:34,487 --> 00:41:36,672
of odours and tastes.

625
00:41:37,432 --> 00:41:39,573
They are my latest creations.

626
00:41:39,673 --> 00:41:42,395
King Lear, Hamlet,

627
00:41:42,664 --> 00:41:45,914
Macbeth,
Romeo and Juliet,

628
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:49,373
The Taming of the Shrew,
The 12th night...

629
00:41:49,605 --> 00:41:53,585
The Merchant of Venice,
A Midsummer Night's Dream,

630
00:41:54,289 --> 00:41:56,720
Othello.
My cocktails are life,

631
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,269
love and music.

632
00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:01,577
Music to drink!
- Yes...

633
00:42:01,677 --> 00:42:03,367
a music to drink!

634
00:42:03,577 --> 00:42:09,243
"O, that this too too solid flesh
would melt..."

635
00:42:09,767 --> 00:42:12,942
"Thaw and resolve itself
into a dew!"

636
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:14,694
My dear ambassador!

637
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:18,050
Countess...
- You really neglected us lately.

638
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:20,706
We missed you.
- I missed you, too, Countess!

639
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:23,764
I couldn't wait
to see you again.

640
00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:27,028
Am I mistaken or have you
put on a bit of weight?

641
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,786
Unfortunately you're right.
It's the stress...

642
00:42:30,061 --> 00:42:31,571
dirty politics...

643
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:35,951
But it's your job after all.
You shouldn't despise it.

644
00:42:36,165 --> 00:42:38,081
I despise it precisely
for that: it's my job,

645
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,084
my everyday burden.

646
00:42:42,283 --> 00:42:45,790
Speaking of politics... Have you
talked to Minister Navarro, Josè?

647
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:48,280
We want our ambassador
to be put in charge.

648
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:51,588
It didn't slip my mind.
Your request has been accepted.

649
00:42:51,688 --> 00:42:55,901
Poor Navarro... he'd certainly
need too distract himself a little.

650
00:42:56,212 --> 00:42:59,203
He spends his days
welcoming people at a castle...

651
00:42:59,303 --> 00:43:03,915
full of silver chandeliers
and with wall carpets of black damast.

652
00:43:05,231 --> 00:43:10,027
I'd be so happy if he came to see us.
Who knows, If he made a day trip to Rome

653
00:43:10,685 --> 00:43:13,330
he might spend some
pleasant hours...

654
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,357
distracting himself,
escaping a little...

655
00:43:16,103 --> 00:43:17,682
Yes, I should...

656
00:43:17,873 --> 00:43:20,731
I should tell him about this place.
- Alright then.

657
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:23,540
To the politics
that can change the world...

658
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,342
And to the politics that <i>can be changed
by</i> the world, my dear Davide...

659
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:32,780
Excuse me for a moment.

660
00:43:34,256 --> 00:43:37,528
Countess...
has my sweet Liv arrived?

661
00:43:37,628 --> 00:43:39,934
I hope she hasn't missed her plane?

662
00:43:40,558 --> 00:43:44,301
Don't worry, Josè.
Stewardesses never miss their plane.

663
00:43:44,401 --> 00:43:46,180
To your health.
- To yours.

664
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,517
Josè....
I'm tired.

665
00:44:23,617 --> 00:44:27,340
Why do you always make me do
the same merry-go-round? Come here.

666
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,629
Why do you talk?
Shut up. You mustn't talk.

667
00:44:31,729 --> 00:44:35,169
You must be nothing but...
but a shadow.

668
00:44:38,379 --> 00:44:41,528
Wait! Why do you
start right away?

669
00:44:41,628 --> 00:44:44,151
We've time on our hands.
What's the hurry?

670
00:44:49,382 --> 00:44:51,354
Promise me not to suffer, Josè.

671
00:44:51,454 --> 00:44:53,841
not to suffer like
you always did,

672
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,189
but just a little.
Angela isn't far...

673
00:44:57,289 --> 00:45:00,505
She's here, with you.
I am her.

674
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,282
Not, it isn't true.
You're not like her.

675
00:45:06,382 --> 00:45:08,332
Turn around.
Look at her.

676
00:45:10,551 --> 00:45:12,299
You look at her, too!

677
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:26,962
Don't be afraid.
Look at her.

678
00:45:27,618 --> 00:45:29,736
Now, everything's different.

679
00:45:29,971 --> 00:45:33,016
No, it's not true.
Nothing's different, it's always her.

680
00:45:33,237 --> 00:45:36,027
You see,
it never ends. It'll never end.

681
00:45:39,105 --> 00:45:42,153
I'm here.
Don't you feel me, Josè?

682
00:45:44,164 --> 00:45:46,114
Josè...

683
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,313
Come...

684
00:46:18,236 --> 00:46:21,407
<i>What a strange idea,
recording my voice...</i>

685
00:46:21,651 --> 00:46:25,244
<i>As if for a museum...
it gives me the creeps</i>

686
00:46:25,735 --> 00:46:28,681
<i>What do you want to do?
Convey it for posterity?</i>

687
00:46:29,149 --> 00:46:31,365
<i>Or don't you trust
our oath of love?</i>

688
00:46:31,465 --> 00:46:33,516
<i>Everlasting love...</i>

689
00:46:35,127 --> 00:46:37,905
<i>Or do you have
the intention of leaving me...</i>

690
00:46:38,889 --> 00:46:41,712
<i>and are thus creating
one of the usual relics?</i>

691
00:46:44,617 --> 00:46:48,664
<i>And what a sad idea to accompany
my voice with this music...</i>

692
00:46:48,969 --> 00:46:52,414
<i>I don't know why but it's like
a kind of funeral march.</i>

693
00:46:52,698 --> 00:46:56,056
<i>Josè! You make me laugh.</i>
- Hear? What a voice...

694
00:46:56,504 --> 00:46:58,532
The most beautiful
voice in the world.

695
00:47:00,222 --> 00:47:03,524
I'll never forget it.
Never.

696
00:47:03,846 --> 00:47:06,042
That's not true, Josè.
It's a voice like mine,

697
00:47:06,142 --> 00:47:09,684
like everyone else's voice.
<i>- Don't you recall what Don Quijote says?</i>

698
00:47:09,784 --> 00:47:11,626
Why did she leave me?

699
00:47:13,025 --> 00:47:15,804
Because she loved someone else.
It happens to many.

700
00:47:15,904 --> 00:47:17,709
What's wrong with that?

701
00:47:18,054 --> 00:47:20,933
<i>Love is never wasted, Josè.</i>

702
00:47:22,848 --> 00:47:25,044
<i>What do you want me
to say now?</i>

703
00:47:25,144 --> 00:47:27,376
<i>That our love will be eternal?</i>

704
00:47:27,699 --> 00:47:29,189
<i>Alright, I'll say it:</i>

705
00:47:29,423 --> 00:47:31,609
<i>Our love will be eternal.</i>

706
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:34,225
<i>That we'll never leave
each other?</i>

707
00:47:34,483 --> 00:47:38,382
<i>Alright, I'll say it:
We'll never leave each other.</i>

708
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,913
Don't think,
don't think!

709
00:47:46,115 --> 00:47:49,507
I'm much better than her.
Look at me.

710
00:47:51,334 --> 00:47:52,801
It's not true!

711
00:47:54,255 --> 00:47:57,359
<i>Yes, sure, I'll say
everything you want me to!</i>

712
00:47:57,647 --> 00:48:01,376
<i>After all they're just words,
it doesn't cost me a thing saying them.</i>

713
00:48:01,476 --> 00:48:05,223
I was hoping that in all these months,
you would've forgotten her, Josè.

714
00:48:05,323 --> 00:48:08,086
Forget her?
But didn't I already tell you?

715
00:48:09,444 --> 00:48:12,254
I'll never forget her.
Never.

716
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:15,413
But why?
I'm here...

717
00:48:15,802 --> 00:48:17,943
Give me the flowers,
I beg you!

718
00:48:18,433 --> 00:48:21,952
<i>I am the kind of woman
who loves only once, Josè.</i>

719
00:48:24,657 --> 00:48:26,830
<i>Love is like poetry.</i>

720
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:29,920
<i>You know that.
Even the most banal lovers...</i>

721
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,581
<i>believe that they always
play new love games...</i>

722
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:35,793
<i>and that love lasts forever.</i>

723
00:48:43,766 --> 00:48:45,324
Angela...

724
00:48:45,705 --> 00:48:47,329
Angela!

725
00:48:51,951 --> 00:48:54,584
My love!
my love...

726
00:48:57,825 --> 00:48:59,685
<i>Josè, for me you are...</i>

727
00:48:59,987 --> 00:49:02,576
<i>for me, you are
the one unforgettable man...</i>

728
00:49:02,676 --> 00:49:05,340
But what are you doing?
Stop it!

729
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,870
<i>...like Romeo for Juliet, 
like Caesar for Cleopatra.</i>

730
00:49:08,038 --> 00:49:11,435
Don't you see that I'm lonely?
- <i>I'm the woman and you're the man.</i>

731
00:49:11,643 --> 00:49:14,228
<i>I'm the island and you're
the sea that's surrounding me...</i>

732
00:49:14,328 --> 00:49:16,514
Come here!

733
00:49:31,836 --> 00:49:34,570
You're kissing poorly today.
What's happening to you?

734
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,421
Today... yesterday...

735
00:49:38,139 --> 00:49:40,399
What do you know
of the days?

736
00:49:41,172 --> 00:49:42,952
You know nothing.

737
00:49:43,052 --> 00:49:44,598
Why?

738
00:49:45,245 --> 00:49:47,755
<i>What else could I say to you
on this tape?</i>

739
00:49:47,855 --> 00:49:52,063
<i>That you're the most extraordinary
and marvellous man to ever love a woman?</i>

740
00:49:52,163 --> 00:49:54,787
<i>It's like that.
It's true, Josè.</i>

741
00:49:55,847 --> 00:49:59,621
<i>I have only you.
I live just for you.</i>

742
00:50:00,144 --> 00:50:03,031
<i>I'm the kind of woman
who loves only once.</i>

743
00:50:04,545 --> 00:50:06,416
It's time. Put on her dress.

744
00:50:06,516 --> 00:50:08,625
<i>What else shall I tell you?</i>

745
00:50:08,999 --> 00:50:12,106
<i>I couldn't desire anyone else
now that I have you.</i>

746
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:16,761
<i>You know, when I'm
in the street or driving in my car,</i>

747
00:50:17,004 --> 00:50:19,626
<i>I don't see the other men,
they don't exist.</i>

748
00:50:20,158 --> 00:50:23,105
<i>since I have you.
You're the only man.</i>

749
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:25,693
<i>No one exists but you.</i>

750
00:50:25,934 --> 00:50:28,624
<i>You're unsurpassable,
overwhelming, unforgettable...</i>

751
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:31,990
Now call me by the names
that she would call me.

752
00:50:32,607 --> 00:50:35,699
Slughi, Chiquito,
Mon cheríe...

753
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:37,696
mein Schatz,

754
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,422
[pet names in various languages]

755
00:50:40,522 --> 00:50:42,951
<i>Listen to the song that...</i>
- Mo grá,

756
00:50:43,051 --> 00:50:46,220
<i>our song of love...</i>
- Now...

757
00:50:46,602 --> 00:50:49,334
the morning's greeting.
- <i>Ours like you are mine...</i>

758
00:50:49,434 --> 00:50:51,385
<i>and I am yours.</i>

759
00:50:51,995 --> 00:50:54,091
Now the afternoon one.

760
00:50:57,629 --> 00:50:59,611
The good night.

761
00:51:06,242 --> 00:51:08,545
And now the photograph.

762
00:51:15,671 --> 00:51:18,404
Here it is, Josè. But I swear
to you, I don't like him.

763
00:51:18,504 --> 00:51:22,603
I don't know how Angela did it,
you're much better.

764
00:51:22,925 --> 00:51:24,550
You are my man.

765
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:27,974
For me,
you're the one unforgettable man.

766
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,952
But you've met him, didn't you?
What did he say...

767
00:51:32,194 --> 00:51:35,519
when you saw him?
- He implored me.

768
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:38,129
A hundred times,
he told me that he loved me.

769
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:40,115
He even cried, you know?

770
00:51:40,215 --> 00:51:43,219
He also called me from New York.
- And what did you tell him?

771
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:45,182
I told him no.

772
00:51:45,401 --> 00:51:48,387
No, I swear to you.
No.

773
00:52:41,655 --> 00:52:43,823
Yes, Josè...
free yourself!

774
00:52:43,923 --> 00:52:45,766
Angela doesn't exist...

775
00:52:45,866 --> 00:52:49,114
Angela has disappeared
into the void...

776
00:52:49,461 --> 00:52:51,668
You're unsurpassable...

777
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:54,803
overwhelming...

778
00:52:56,156 --> 00:52:58,621
unforgettable...

779
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:03,892
Now, you are free.

780
00:53:03,992 --> 00:53:07,811
You are free and you know it.
Angela doesn't exist anymore.

781
00:53:07,911 --> 00:53:11,472
She's a shadow.
You're invincible...

782
00:53:11,572 --> 00:53:14,413
She's not up to you,
she's far away...

783
00:53:14,513 --> 00:53:17,111
she's finished,
you succeeded!

784
00:53:19,805 --> 00:53:22,158
You'll never see her again.

785
00:53:22,862 --> 00:53:25,046
Josè...

786
00:53:32,004 --> 00:53:35,153
You don't see her anymore,
she has disappeared.

787
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:38,996
Now, I'll make you
one of my cocktails.

788
00:53:39,251 --> 00:53:41,985
Alright?
- No, Davide...

789
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,539
No no.

790
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:46,789
Today I want none of your complicated
concoctions but just some wine.

791
00:53:46,889 --> 00:53:49,696
Red wine,
from the cellar.

792
00:53:51,475 --> 00:53:55,083
Afterwards we'll make love
as God commands us.

793
00:53:57,341 --> 00:54:01,192
Yes, but try not to forget
about that girl, Gilda.

794
00:54:22,428 --> 00:54:23,896
What about her?

795
00:54:23,996 --> 00:54:26,641
That one? Yes, she's not bad
but her hips are too narrow.

796
00:54:26,741 --> 00:54:29,218
Yes, you're right.
- Besides, she's too dark.

797
00:54:29,318 --> 00:54:33,326
Like beduine. We need to
find something very different.

798
00:54:34,837 --> 00:54:37,277
Why not that one?
- No, not her. She's blonde.

799
00:54:37,377 --> 00:54:39,451
Mrs. Gilda said:
"Enough with the blondes!"

800
00:54:39,551 --> 00:54:43,468
We have to find a brunette of 18 years,
a girl from the countryside.

801
00:54:43,568 --> 00:54:47,455
Hi! - How are you? - Fine.
- How was the trip? - Just fine!

802
00:54:47,555 --> 00:54:50,322
What a shame.
She seemed the right type.

803
00:54:50,524 --> 00:54:53,269
And how about this one?
- Yes, she might do.

804
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:55,062
Surely from Calabria.

805
00:54:55,162 --> 00:54:57,785
Look what she's reading.
She seems like the right type.

806
00:54:57,885 --> 00:55:00,602
Go, get her!
No, wait!

807
00:55:00,702 --> 00:55:04,143
Hi mum! [Sicilian dialect]
- See how the little one has grown?

808
00:55:05,944 --> 00:55:09,451
Calm down. Many more trains
will arrive before tonight.

809
00:55:09,551 --> 00:55:13,908
Sure. A dark one might arrive
anytime before tomorrow morning.

810
00:55:16,955 --> 00:55:18,478
Come on,
let's go to the buses.

811
00:55:18,578 --> 00:55:20,719
There are girls
coming straight from the south.

812
00:55:24,706 --> 00:55:26,409
Look how many peasants...

813
00:55:26,509 --> 00:55:30,496
they smell like a cowshed.
- They all look like pigs to me.

814
00:55:30,596 --> 00:55:32,922
piled one on top of the other...

815
00:55:33,022 --> 00:55:35,880
Here, we'll find much easier
what we're looking for.

816
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:38,859
One moment...

817
00:56:18,695 --> 00:56:20,667
Did you hurt yourself?

818
00:56:21,235 --> 00:56:24,328
What is it?
- Look at that!

819
00:56:25,706 --> 00:56:28,081
What did they do to you?
What happened?

820
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,557
They robbed me...
What? My money, of course!

821
00:56:31,657 --> 00:56:35,961
Sickening, you can't live here anymore!
- Let's wait for the police.

822
00:56:36,061 --> 00:56:38,112
Come on, don't cry!
- Chicken thieves!

823
00:56:38,212 --> 00:56:41,619
Don't worry, Miss,
I'll call the police immediately!

824
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:43,221
Where did he hurt you?

825
00:56:43,321 --> 00:56:45,404
It's nothing serious.

826
00:56:46,254 --> 00:56:48,635
I've seen everything,
he ran in that direction!

827
00:56:48,735 --> 00:56:50,909
You saw the thief?
Come with me then.

828
00:56:51,727 --> 00:56:54,999
Who knows
where he'll be by now?

829
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:06,032
Cheer up,
don't let yourself go.

830
00:57:12,409 --> 00:57:14,269
Come on!

831
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,926
Take a seat
- Give that to me, I'll handle it.

832
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,744
Three cognacs!
- No, I'll take a coffee.

833
00:57:29,844 --> 00:57:32,246
No! I said three cognacs.
- Right away.

834
00:57:33,511 --> 00:57:35,940
What did you come
to Rome for?

835
00:57:37,374 --> 00:57:39,613
Don't you know
that Rome is a jungle?

836
00:57:39,836 --> 00:57:41,752
In my village they said
that if you're determined,

837
00:57:41,852 --> 00:57:44,755
you can make a living in the city!

838
00:57:44,855 --> 00:57:47,934
Yes, indeed.
- That's why I came.

839
00:57:48,034 --> 00:57:49,543
I'm going to be somebody.

840
00:57:49,643 --> 00:57:52,468
There is such a lot of delinquency
everywhere nowadays...

841
00:57:52,734 --> 00:57:55,918
that living in the city
is something to fear by now.

842
00:57:56,018 --> 00:57:58,662
And now, where do I go?
What do I do?

843
00:57:58,762 --> 00:58:01,943
Without any money,
nor friends nor relatives here?

844
00:58:02,043 --> 00:58:05,191
I don't have anyone!
- Don't worry, everything will be fine.

845
00:58:05,437 --> 00:58:08,060
I have a friend who can host you
for a couple of days, you'll see.

846
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,737
A place to stay for the night?
- Yes, at a Countess's house.

847
00:58:10,837 --> 00:58:12,630
One lives really well
at her place.

848
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,049
There's nothing lacking,
you'll like it!

849
00:58:15,149 --> 00:58:16,921
She's a real lady.

850
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:19,811
Go ahead and pay.

851
00:58:38,513 --> 00:58:41,428
Am I disturbing you?
- Come closer!

852
00:58:42,468 --> 00:58:44,688
Giusi told me about
your mishap.

853
00:58:45,885 --> 00:58:47,880
'Tis a city of criminals!

854
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:51,028
But I'm happy to accomodate you!
- Just for one night, you know?

855
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:52,830
I don't have any relatives here.

856
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:56,799
I could make a call home, if I may,
so they can send me some money.

857
00:58:56,899 --> 00:58:59,039
Not for going back,
you know...

858
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:02,007
I won't go back...
I won't go back.

859
00:59:02,231 --> 00:59:04,247
I have my pride.

860
00:59:05,511 --> 00:59:07,618
You're doing
the right thing, dear.

861
00:59:09,228 --> 00:59:10,585
But you needn't worry,

862
00:59:10,685 --> 00:59:15,095
as you can see, my house is large
enough and besides, I really like you!

863
00:59:15,477 --> 00:59:17,867
Calm down, dear.
Make yourself at home.

864
00:59:17,967 --> 00:59:21,644
I assure you that it's no problem,
you can stay as long as you like!

865
00:59:23,187 --> 00:59:25,321
Go ahead, put down your luggage.

866
00:59:25,421 --> 00:59:27,797
I'll have it taken upstairs
to your room.

867
00:59:28,343 --> 00:59:30,663
Kifayesu!
- Yes, Countess?

868
00:59:31,579 --> 00:59:33,977
Take her to the room
on the third floor.

869
00:59:34,077 --> 00:59:35,845
Take care of her.

870
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,940
Thank you. I won't even unpack
my bag. I'll stay just for one night.

871
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:46,189
Don't worry about it,
stop thinking and unpack!

872
00:59:47,091 --> 00:59:48,873
Unpack...

873
01:00:04,825 --> 01:00:06,752
Nice...

874
01:00:09,082 --> 01:00:11,559
Take this one off.
- No!

875
01:00:11,828 --> 01:00:15,648
It's St. Anthony's scapular.
I'd rather die than taking it off.

876
01:00:36,683 --> 01:00:39,922
Countess, why did you bother?
You shouldn't have!

877
01:00:40,022 --> 01:00:42,910
It's no bother.
You must be hungry.

878
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:45,955
You're young.
- I feel as if I'm dreaming.

879
01:00:46,055 --> 01:00:49,213
But what dream?
I like you, Linda!

880
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:51,050
That's all.

881
01:00:53,485 --> 01:00:56,521
Moreover, I'd like to say -
one can see you have it in you...

882
01:00:56,621 --> 01:00:58,605
you'll get ahead in life!
- You really think so?

883
01:00:58,705 --> 01:01:02,232
You have personality,
a good sense of humor...

884
01:01:02,894 --> 01:01:04,849
Really?
- Yes!

885
01:01:05,364 --> 01:01:07,692
But now,
you have to do me a favour.

886
01:01:08,042 --> 01:01:10,692
Excuse me,
but... I don't understand!

887
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:13,224
Me, a favour?
Of what kind?

888
01:01:13,324 --> 01:01:16,025
Impossible!
How could I do you a favour?

889
01:01:16,266 --> 01:01:18,350
I say that on your behalf.

890
01:01:18,498 --> 01:01:21,543
My husband has decided
to help you. Talk to him.

891
01:01:21,643 --> 01:01:25,263
Don't forget to tell him about
everything that you'd like to do!

892
01:01:25,462 --> 01:01:29,126
He'll get you acquainted with
someone who might be useful.

893
01:01:30,636 --> 01:01:32,047
Talk to him.

894
01:01:32,283 --> 01:01:33,997
Davide?

895
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:42,426
You called me, darling?
- Yes, Davide.

896
01:01:42,905 --> 01:01:45,714
Our new friend here wants to
confess all of her dreams to you,

897
01:01:45,814 --> 01:01:49,913
all her hopes. I'd like to ask you
not to disappoint her.

898
01:01:50,013 --> 01:01:53,787
Go on, tell me, dear.
What skills do you have?

899
01:01:54,835 --> 01:01:59,587
Tell me, don't be ashamed. Do you know
how to dance, how to sing...? - Yes!

900
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,720
Not bad, you're quite in tune!

901
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:09,434
I'll call the general manager of TV.
I have his personal number.

902
01:02:09,534 --> 01:02:12,569
He's a close friend of mine.
If he can do me a favour...

903
01:02:12,669 --> 01:02:14,328
Usually, he never declines.

904
01:02:14,428 --> 01:02:17,641
Is it the general manager?
Yes, it's me.

905
01:02:18,409 --> 01:02:21,546
I have an exceptional girl here.
She wants to sing on television.

906
01:02:21,646 --> 01:02:23,896
I wish you could hear her singing,

907
01:02:23,996 --> 01:02:26,204
it's worth it. It's a try
you shouldn't miss.

908
01:02:26,304 --> 01:02:29,263
Alright.
I'll come tomorrow morning.

909
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:36,815
He'll come tomorrow.
He's a very important man.

910
01:02:37,297 --> 01:02:39,146
Very busy, too.

911
01:02:40,106 --> 01:02:42,672
At this hour, he can't
leave his office.

912
01:02:42,772 --> 01:02:44,527
Tomorrow he will be all yours!

913
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:47,762
Be very, very nice to him,
don't forget that!

914
01:02:47,862 --> 01:02:51,032
Do everything he says.
Sing, dance...

915
01:02:51,132 --> 01:02:53,014
And if he wants
to drink with you, drink!

916
01:02:53,114 --> 01:02:56,067
Drink to your future,
to your success, to glory!

917
01:02:56,167 --> 01:02:59,977
What time tomorrow?
- In the morning, it's a promise.

918
01:03:05,363 --> 01:03:09,262
See? You are very lucky
to stay in this house, Linda.

919
01:03:09,362 --> 01:03:11,041
Don't you think so?

920
01:03:37,841 --> 01:03:39,510
But why that?

921
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:42,166
What question!
It's simple, Linda:

922
01:03:42,266 --> 01:03:46,577
The papers will publish your photo
because you're so beautiful and likeable!

923
01:03:49,303 --> 01:03:52,250
Take your hands off!
- But he's a friend!

924
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:53,874
A good friend...

925
01:03:53,974 --> 01:03:56,269
Don't be afraid,
you have nothing to hold back,

926
01:03:56,369 --> 01:03:59,216
he's from "the other side" [he's gay].
- Now look at me, sweetie.

927
01:04:06,224 --> 01:04:08,297
Stay like that!
There!

928
01:04:08,397 --> 01:04:10,762
You have a magnificent
sense of posture!

929
01:04:10,862 --> 01:04:13,619
One more minute,
and we'll be finished.

930
01:04:14,498 --> 01:04:17,849
Come on, get moving!
You've fallen asleep!

931
01:04:23,657 --> 01:04:25,584
That will be enough for now.

932
01:04:26,794 --> 01:04:29,013
You've been great, my dear.

933
01:04:31,165 --> 01:04:34,291
You'll be very successful,
I'm sure of it.

934
01:04:47,722 --> 01:04:49,560
Aren't I beautiful?

935
01:04:56,022 --> 01:04:58,666
Thank you,
blessed St. Anthony!

936
01:05:16,406 --> 01:05:19,464
You have to make it strong,
very strong, Davide.

937
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:21,677
I'm not sure if
that will be enough.

938
01:05:21,777 --> 01:05:24,355
Maybe, we're in need of
something stronger...

939
01:05:36,529 --> 01:05:39,935
It's better to keep this stuff
in sight, that way it's less suspicious.

940
01:05:40,518 --> 01:05:43,610
It's a present from Liv,
she brought it from Singapore.

941
01:05:45,139 --> 01:05:46,764
Mix it in her drink.

942
01:05:47,179 --> 01:05:49,700
She'll need a lot of it.

943
01:05:52,175 --> 01:05:56,774
Let's toast to your luck,
to your certain success!

944
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:05,264
I've never had champagne.

945
01:06:05,364 --> 01:06:08,096
I don't like it.
- They told me good things about you.

946
01:06:08,196 --> 01:06:11,143
You'll become famous, Linda!
- Thank you.

947
01:06:24,426 --> 01:06:27,863
Pardon me...
I'm getting sleepy.

948
01:06:27,963 --> 01:06:30,059
I'm unable to
say anything anymore.

949
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:31,953
What do you want to say?

950
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:37,561
Pardon, Sir...
- Come on, lie down, rest a little.

951
01:06:39,236 --> 01:06:43,503
No, don't bother, leave it!
- No no, rest, Linda.

952
01:08:59,329 --> 01:09:01,951
What're you doing?
Have you gone mad?

953
01:09:03,648 --> 01:09:05,003
You...

954
01:09:05,103 --> 01:09:08,589
The tiles are smooth.
You could slip.

955
01:09:10,612 --> 01:09:12,494
Look.

956
01:09:12,853 --> 01:09:14,914
Do you know
what a polaroid is?

957
01:09:17,091 --> 01:09:20,661
Nice, aren't they?
Did you see those colors?

958
01:09:21,371 --> 01:09:24,239
Your father and mother
would like them as well.

959
01:09:26,986 --> 01:09:28,823
If you say one word to anybody

960
01:09:28,923 --> 01:09:32,039
about what happened,
I'll send these to your parents.

961
01:09:32,139 --> 01:09:34,243
I swear that I'll send them.

962
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:21,867
What are you doing here?

963
01:10:22,649 --> 01:10:25,652
You want to hurt yourself...
- It's you I want to hurt, dirty pimp,

964
01:10:25,752 --> 01:10:27,304
I'll kill you!

965
01:10:30,652 --> 01:10:33,016
I told you
that you'd hurt yourself.

966
01:10:33,116 --> 01:10:35,781
I'll leave, you bastards,
I'll tell everyone!

967
01:10:35,881 --> 01:10:37,383
I'll shout what you are,

968
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,904
and the disgusting things
you did to me!

969
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:45,913
You're all against me,
but I'll send all of you to prison!

970
01:10:46,156 --> 01:10:49,820
You, and everyone
who's in this house!

971
01:10:50,635 --> 01:10:53,467
But Linda,
what words!

972
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:56,459
Why do you say
that we're against you?

973
01:10:57,218 --> 01:10:59,750
You seem a little
upset to me, my dear.

974
01:11:03,263 --> 01:11:07,139
What are you going to tell?
That we are fine gentlemen?

975
01:11:07,652 --> 01:11:09,859
Maybe that we are chivalrous men?

976
01:11:09,959 --> 01:11:12,783
Do you realise
that you're talking against us,

977
01:11:12,883 --> 01:11:16,007
we who treated you
like a queen in this house?

978
01:11:16,107 --> 01:11:18,851
What do you want to do?
Why do you want to leave?

979
01:11:18,951 --> 01:11:22,424
Go on then! 

980
01:11:27,688 --> 01:11:29,413
I'LL TELL EVERYTHING!

981
01:11:46,169 --> 01:11:48,481
You've been too brutal
with her.

982
01:11:51,889 --> 01:11:54,992
Poor girl, she's just
a little, inexperienced fawn.

983
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:59,293
A little fawn
that wanted to flee.

984
01:12:08,738 --> 01:12:11,415
Go on, take care of her.
Treat her well.

985
01:12:11,515 --> 01:12:13,889
I don't want anything bad
happening to her.

986
01:12:13,989 --> 01:12:16,407
You have too heavy a hand, dear.

987
01:12:16,763 --> 01:12:19,261
Go on, revive her!

988
01:12:19,361 --> 01:12:22,463
Give her something to drink.
Lie her down on the couch.

989
01:12:24,228 --> 01:12:25,931
What did you beat her for?

990
01:12:26,031 --> 01:12:28,889
Didn't you see she had enough?
- She didn't!

991
01:12:28,989 --> 01:12:30,861
She brought it upon herself!

992
01:12:39,799 --> 01:12:43,172
Her blood
has been shed twice today.

993
01:12:44,152 --> 01:12:46,034
It's disgusting.

994
01:12:48,261 --> 01:12:50,323
Daisy? Daisy!

995
01:12:54,194 --> 01:12:56,659
Yes, Ma'am?
- Clean up.

996
01:13:13,211 --> 01:13:15,138
What did you do to me?

997
01:13:15,384 --> 01:13:17,491
Nothing, dear, nothing.

998
01:13:17,591 --> 01:13:20,640
You just worked yourself up
a little too much, that's all.

999
01:13:22,323 --> 01:13:24,945
If you still want to leave,
you can go now.

1000
01:13:27,718 --> 01:13:30,239
But no gossip.
It won't do any good.

1001
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:33,040
Girls too chatty
always end up badly...

1002
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:35,543
and you've only just seen
part of it.

1003
01:13:43,503 --> 01:13:45,498
My... my luggage!

1004
01:13:45,598 --> 01:13:48,903
Go upstairs and pack!
We are not your maids.

1005
01:13:49,159 --> 01:13:51,613
But what's there to pack?
You'll come back soon, anyway!

1006
01:13:51,834 --> 01:13:54,187
Is that your gratitude?

1007
01:13:54,287 --> 01:13:55,742
You're leaving like this,

1008
01:13:55,842 --> 01:13:59,400
without even taking the 100.000
lira we put aside for you?

1009
01:14:01,234 --> 01:14:04,876
You'd better watch out!
If you spill one word outside,

1010
01:14:04,976 --> 01:14:07,106
we'll find you
wherever you'll be...

1011
01:14:07,206 --> 01:14:08,896
and fix you a nice funeral.

1012
01:14:08,996 --> 01:14:11,215
A first-class funeral.

1013
01:14:13,088 --> 01:14:14,522
Come on,
stay here!

1014
01:14:14,622 --> 01:14:17,110
Don't you want to live in such a nice house?

1015
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:20,390
Do you know what we'll have
for lunch today? Truffled pheasant!

1016
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:23,785
Eat it and choke on it!
I won't stay here.

1017
01:14:23,885 --> 01:14:25,872
And if you try
to look for me...

1018
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:28,701
It'll be I who'll send you
to the cemetery!

1019
01:14:31,948 --> 01:14:33,662
What nonsense
that girl's saying!

1020
01:14:33,762 --> 01:14:37,259
We'll see if she won't return.
She'll be back this evening.

1021
01:14:37,505 --> 01:14:40,295
She walks towards the gate.
She doesn't even turn around.

1022
01:14:40,395 --> 01:14:43,105
But it doesn't seem
as if she's in a great hurry.

1023
01:14:44,514 --> 01:14:46,710
It's inevitable, with all that
confusion in her head.

1024
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:50,292
You've beaten her up too much.
She's all dazed.

1025
01:14:55,192 --> 01:14:57,141
Enough of that, let's go!

1026
01:14:57,573 --> 01:14:59,141
What is it?

1027
01:14:59,713 --> 01:15:01,909
Why that face, my love?

1028
01:15:02,657 --> 01:15:04,461
What troubles you?

1029
01:15:05,477 --> 01:15:07,427
This disgusting life...

1030
01:15:08,242 --> 01:15:10,528
That hell just before
and then...

1031
01:15:10,628 --> 01:15:12,117
Oh Davide...

1032
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:15,375
But what are you saying, Gilda!
You're exaggerating.

1033
01:15:15,968 --> 01:15:18,524
Our bills were hell.

1034
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:22,263
The life we lead before
was hell.

1035
01:15:23,156 --> 01:15:26,205
When you and I
had nothing.

1036
01:15:26,593 --> 01:15:30,333
When we lived like trees
and were nobodies.

1037
01:15:32,352 --> 01:15:34,980
Life isn't disgusting at all...

1038
01:15:35,321 --> 01:15:37,708
Life is incredibly beautiful...

1039
01:15:39,598 --> 01:15:41,436
stupendous,

1040
01:15:41,937 --> 01:15:44,772
always new,
incredible.

1041
01:15:45,957 --> 01:15:47,862
It's a paradise.

1042
01:15:48,097 --> 01:15:49,957
A paradise.

1043
01:15:54,557 --> 01:15:57,179
I'm afraid the minister won't come tonight. 
It's already too late.

1044
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:00,585
The evening has just begun.
-  If he doesn't come, for me our evening might as well end.

1045
01:16:00,685 --> 01:16:03,361
You never have confidence.
- It's not a question of confidence.

1046
01:16:03,461 --> 01:16:05,857
Thank God.
There he is!

1047
01:16:05,957 --> 01:16:08,633
What did I tell you?
- My compliments, countess.

1048
01:16:08,733 --> 01:16:11,499
Good evening, your excellency.
I'm very happy that you left

1049
01:16:11,599 --> 01:16:14,501
your major obligations
to visit us tonight.

1050
01:16:14,601 --> 01:16:17,983
In particular since we know
that you never have a second to lose.

1051
01:16:18,083 --> 01:16:21,630
I've wanted to congratulate you
in person, Countess.

1052
01:16:21,730 --> 01:16:23,521
Isn't it your name-day today?

1053
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:28,398
No, unfortunately it's my birthday,
your excellency. Don't remind me!

1054
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:49,101
May I introduce to you
the Duchess of Barkis?

1055
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:50,882
Duchess.

1056
01:16:52,885 --> 01:16:55,339
Next week,
as soon as I arrive in Madrid...

1057
01:16:55,439 --> 01:17:00,501
I'll send you Morena and Luisela.
They are so beautiful, so sweet...

1058
01:17:00,601 --> 01:17:04,112
Can you help these girls?
They deserve it...

1059
01:17:04,212 --> 01:17:07,350
You see,
Madrid is too small for them.

1060
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:10,171
Sure, my dear.
Send them whenever you want.

1061
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:15,020
We'll organise a fashion parade
in Ischia in a month and a half.

1062
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:17,605
Your two beauties will have
a fantastic takeoff there.

1063
01:17:17,705 --> 01:17:20,762
I'm so grateful for your help...

1064
01:17:20,862 --> 01:17:23,627
you know that your protegées
Cleo and Ambra...

1065
01:17:23,727 --> 01:17:25,966
they made their luck in Madrid.

1066
01:17:26,066 --> 01:17:29,090
I know, I know. It's been
all your doing, Consuelo.

1067
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:32,795
Do you know that they wrote
they loved you like a mum?

1068
01:17:54,424 --> 01:17:58,379
Ladies and gentlemen,
since it's Gilda's birthday,

1069
01:17:58,614 --> 01:18:03,496
we'll all dance a waltz,
like in the beautiful olden days.

1070
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:53,314
Wednesday at 5.

1071
01:18:53,907 --> 01:18:58,061
For the entire evening, Jane.
- Alright.

1072
01:19:02,056 --> 01:19:04,286
Sunday at 4.

1073
01:19:29,925 --> 01:19:32,144
The villa of surprises...

1074
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:57,515
Our most expected guest – without
offending anyone – has arrived.

1075
01:19:58,263 --> 01:20:01,871
Youth itself.
The motive for all our anxieties.

1076
01:20:01,971 --> 01:20:05,263
the object of all our regrets.

1077
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:11,399
What we never were
and never will be.

1078
01:20:11,731 --> 01:20:13,389
Beauty,

1079
01:20:13,489 --> 01:20:17,358
total and natural happiness,

1080
01:20:17,765 --> 01:20:19,406
the most intense,
most rare.

1081
01:20:19,506 --> 01:20:23,182
Hi Davide! I already told you
not to tie down the dogs!

1082
01:20:23,282 --> 01:20:25,106
They suffer too much
and get aggressive.

1083
01:20:25,206 --> 01:20:29,286
Why don't you let them into the house?
They'd enjoy themselves a lot with us!

1084
01:20:32,585 --> 01:20:35,476
Hey, what happened to you
tonight? You're making such faces!

1085
01:20:35,576 --> 01:20:38,443
Don't tell me that you expected
to enjoy yourselves with <i>me</i> tonight?

1086
01:20:38,543 --> 01:20:41,261
But why, yes.
It been you we were expecting.

1087
01:20:41,361 --> 01:20:45,916
Everyone of us is sure that you can
give us something more, you know, Jules?

1088
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:48,594
Okay. I'm ready to give you that.

1089
01:20:48,694 --> 01:20:53,063
Ask whatever you want.
Ask and you shall receive. Everything.

1090
01:20:55,051 --> 01:20:58,659
Jules, my winged genius...
I missed you a lot.

1091
01:21:01,698 --> 01:21:03,855
Without you,
vice seems like a virtue

1092
01:21:03,955 --> 01:21:07,308
and pleasure more boring
than an old book on heraldry.

1093
01:21:07,818 --> 01:21:11,538
Only if you suffer without me,
you can be happy with me.

1094
01:21:15,678 --> 01:21:17,829
None of you will
ever get tired of Jules!

1095
01:21:17,929 --> 01:21:21,779
You won't have time. I always manage
to beat it at the right moment.

1096
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:28,628
Davide, tell your friends
how old I am.

1097
01:21:28,807 --> 01:21:31,441
Tell them. It's the first thing
they need to now.

1098
01:21:31,541 --> 01:21:35,875
Eighteen.
My little Jules is 18 years old.

1099
01:21:39,739 --> 01:21:43,111
I'm very old.
Death comes closer every minute.

1100
01:21:43,211 --> 01:21:46,436
seconds might count like years,
you don't hear the walking death.

1101
01:21:46,536 --> 01:21:49,268
Watch out.
it comes on tip-toes.

1102
01:21:49,601 --> 01:21:51,685
But it doesn't matter to us
if death walks.

1103
01:21:51,785 --> 01:21:55,338
Let's have all of my kisses.
Only mine are kisses.

1104
01:22:05,349 --> 01:22:07,366
But Ma'am...

1105
01:22:07,624 --> 01:22:09,865
your breasts are marvellous.

1106
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:12,892
Why keep them hidden in dark?
That's not right!

1107
01:22:13,145 --> 01:22:15,025
They need light.

1108
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:19,249
You are a magnificent tree
who just has to offer its fruits.

1109
01:22:22,055 --> 01:22:25,170
Who are you?
What do you want?

1110
01:22:25,428 --> 01:22:27,845
My name?
What's a name?

1111
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,053
Names are useless.

1112
01:22:31,414 --> 01:22:34,305
How pale you are, Gilda.
Come on, let your hair loose.

1113
01:22:34,405 --> 01:22:36,097
Smile.

1114
01:22:36,408 --> 01:22:38,358
Do you want my 18 years?

1115
01:22:39,114 --> 01:22:41,233
I'll open my veins
and offer you my blood.

1116
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:43,751
It should be enough
to make you happy.

1117
01:22:43,851 --> 01:22:46,585
Just that would be enough,
the rest is already there.

1118
01:22:49,044 --> 01:22:53,067
I want you to kiss.
- Why us? We should be the last.

1119
01:22:53,714 --> 01:22:55,652
If you don't, I'll leave.

1120
01:23:11,513 --> 01:23:13,518
That's just the beginning.

1121
01:23:13,618 --> 01:23:17,888
A taste of the harmony that will
reign in this house thanks to me.

1122
01:23:20,467 --> 01:23:24,398
What a strong smell of incense here,
like in a mortuary chapel!

1123
01:23:24,498 --> 01:23:28,252
No Jules, you're mistaken.
this intoxicating smell of incense...

1124
01:23:28,352 --> 01:23:30,258
It's not just for the dead: it's for the living too,...

1125
01:23:30,358 --> 01:23:33,045
which might be sadder.
It's your decision.

1126
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:38,736
For me, incense is incense.

1127
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:44,015
But my perfume is stronger: 18 years
of age. They don't sell it in shops.

1128
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:49,193
Come on, help me. Be my friend.

1129
01:23:49,293 --> 01:23:52,207
I promise to you that I'll be
all yours, with body and mind.

1130
01:23:52,307 --> 01:23:53,974
Undress me.

1131
01:23:54,468 --> 01:23:56,014
Wash me.

1132
01:23:56,114 --> 01:24:00,616
I'll be your food. Eating of me
will bring you some of my youth.

1133
01:24:02,627 --> 01:24:05,249
Everything of me
you'll discover will be yours!

1134
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:12,647
Depilate me all over!
Cut my nails!

1135
01:24:15,185 --> 01:24:17,224
What sad faces you pull!

1136
01:24:17,324 --> 01:24:20,266
Are you sure that you're alive
or are you dead?

1137
01:24:20,683 --> 01:24:23,148
I want to drink, I'm thirsty.
- Right away.

1138
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,507
Thank you.

1139
01:24:34,050 --> 01:24:35,641
Have some, too.

1140
01:24:38,022 --> 01:24:41,171
You're thirsty too, Davide.
And you! And you!

1141
01:24:41,613 --> 01:24:44,213
Now that you have
fresh and clean faces - Kiss me!

1142
01:24:46,025 --> 01:24:49,050
Slowly, slowly.
Do it slowly!

1143
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:52,644
But don't you drink here,
don't you play music?

1144
01:24:52,744 --> 01:24:55,745
At Louis XIV's court,
they never ate without music.

1145
01:24:59,078 --> 01:25:02,328
You first, Davide -
drink to youth!

1146
01:25:02,549 --> 01:25:04,207
Drink slowly.

1147
01:25:05,885 --> 01:25:09,584
I reserved the best part of me
for you: the dessert!

1148
01:25:11,601 --> 01:25:14,362
Put on some suitable music
and turn down the light!

1149
01:25:25,864 --> 01:25:28,170
Now, do everything you want.

1150
01:25:29,097 --> 01:25:32,702
Absolutely everything. Eat me,
drink me, kill me if you want.

1151
01:25:32,802 --> 01:25:35,924
But do it quickly because
in half an hour, I'll hit the road!

1152
01:26:03,058 --> 01:26:06,968
She's gone.
The swallow has flown away.

1153
01:26:14,298 --> 01:26:16,371
Smell of blood...

1154
01:26:17,377 --> 01:26:20,705
"Here’s the smell of the blood still."

1155
01:26:23,957 --> 01:26:27,217
The little hand of Lady Macbeth.

1156
01:26:27,674 --> 01:26:31,582
"All the perfumes of Arabia
will not sweeten..."

1157
01:26:31,682 --> 01:26:34,036
"this little hand!"

1158
01:26:44,387 --> 01:26:46,869
What are you doing?
Are you praying?

1159
01:26:47,423 --> 01:26:50,080
No no, I'm reciting Shakespeare.

1160
01:26:50,604 --> 01:26:55,200
The little hand
of Lady Macbeth...

1161
01:26:55,456 --> 01:26:59,144
It helps me when
I'm in need of a bit of peace.

1162
01:26:59,937 --> 01:27:02,841
You were afraid, too,
weren't you, Davide?

1163
01:27:04,262 --> 01:27:07,859
All things considered,
it wasn't an unpleasant excitement.

1164
01:27:08,069 --> 01:27:10,714
But were you aware of
what could've happened?

1165
01:27:10,814 --> 01:27:12,876
We completely lost control
of ourselves.

1166
01:27:13,086 --> 01:27:15,338
We've never sunken so low.

1167
01:27:15,438 --> 01:27:17,630
We behaved like beasts.

1168
01:27:18,773 --> 01:27:21,148
But if nothing's happened...

1169
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:27,148
Jules is intelligent enough to know
when to arrive and when to beat it.

1170
01:27:37,512 --> 01:27:38,962
Davide!

1171
01:27:45,952 --> 01:27:48,033
Davide! There are...

1172
01:27:48,259 --> 01:27:51,237
moments in which
I wished you died!

1173
01:27:52,165 --> 01:27:55,851
You know I've been living
for so long in symbiosis with death.

1174
01:28:02,125 --> 01:28:04,075
Those pigs are still here!

1175
01:28:04,175 --> 01:28:06,439
Why don't you send them away?

1176
01:28:07,789 --> 01:28:09,481
Why should I?

1177
01:28:09,581 --> 01:28:12,459
They do less damage here
than elsewhere.

01:28:12,559 --> 01:28:14,285
They are sleeping.

1179
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:19,176
This time, I'm leaving.
I mean it.

1180
01:28:20,173 --> 01:28:22,705
I can't stand it any longer.

1181
01:28:24,347 --> 01:28:27,047
Why do you want to leave?
The night is over.

1182
01:28:27,147 --> 01:28:29,344
Aren't you sleepy, dear?

1183
01:28:30,459 --> 01:28:35,352
We'll see the guests off soon.
See? They're all leaving.

1184
01:28:45,658 --> 01:28:47,652
Linda! Why did you come back?

1185
01:28:48,033 --> 01:28:50,778
Go away!
Get out of here!

1186
01:28:57,456 --> 01:28:59,735
Tell me that she stopped...

1187
01:29:00,161 --> 01:29:02,256
that she stopped...

1188
01:29:05,596 --> 01:29:08,061
Why did she come back here?

1189
01:29:12,941 --> 01:29:15,731
No!
I don't want to!

1190
01:29:26,656 --> 01:29:28,046
No...

1191
01:29:30,553 --> 01:29:32,368
Send her away!

1192
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:37,345
Away, away from me!

1193
01:29:43,348 --> 01:29:45,455
What would you've become
elsewhere?

1194
01:29:45,555 --> 01:29:48,614
But here, you'll find love.

1195
01:29:48,858 --> 01:29:51,245
The sun will shine.
