00:00:21,334 --> 00:00:26,034
<b><font color="#ffff00">Prepared and arranged by zero boy</font></b>

2
00:00:27,135 --> 00:00:32,457
<font color="#80ff00"><b>^_~ my instagram >> im_0boy</b></font>

3
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:37,068
I won't be until after lunch.
No, I'm not sick. Fucking.

4
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:44,622
Visions. Energy.
Dedication.

5
00:00:44,783 --> 00:00:49,141
Three career-promoting words.

6
00:00:49,304 --> 00:00:53,037
Here are the other two:
"Listen to me."

7
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:57,670
Things are starting to change.

8
00:00:57,828 --> 00:01:00,126
Change with them -

9
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:04,070
or leave your pass
and disappear -

10
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,224
the best TV company in the world.

11
00:01:10,192 --> 00:01:13,880
Soft thinking
is the job of the sheep.

12
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:16,595
The fox collects the creams from the top.

13
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:20,135
Second, the best
is not an option.

14
00:01:20,276 --> 00:01:23,326
Receive the message!

15
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:31,131
Sorry. So?
- My egg is ready.

16
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,608
Fuck me now. - Fuck you?
I'm just meeting.

17
00:01:40,444 --> 00:01:47,056
Sorry, Nigel. One colleague
has not yet received the message.

18
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:56,945
Sorry.

19
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,066
EMERGENCY EXIT

20
00:02:13,096 --> 00:02:15,554
BABY FEVER

21
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,359
Good morning.

22
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:29,452
Did the lady order a pan service?

23
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:31,402
Yes! Yes!

24
00:03:31,565 --> 00:03:34,490
Yes!

25
00:03:51,573 --> 00:03:56,808
What the hell have you been?
- At an important meeting.

26
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:59,649
Horizontal deep penetration.

27
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:01,535
Good.

28
00:04:01,697 --> 00:04:08,116
You haven't missed much.
Some idiot sounded the alarm.

29
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,457
When trying to make a baby -

30
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:19,152
a woman’s egg is like
cooking an egg . Timing is difficult.

31
00:04:19,303 --> 00:04:22,478
You just have to seize the
opportunity.

32
00:04:23,865 --> 00:04:28,304
Sorry but now was the right
time. - It's a pleasure to help.

33
00:04:30,707 --> 00:04:34,634
Isn't it beautiful?
- Yes, I think so.

34
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:37,793
Not comparable to
our wedding.

35
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,764
Hey? Quick "I want"
and snacks in the park?

36
00:04:42,912 --> 00:04:45,802
Picnic and sonnet.

37
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:50,437
The most important thing is not how, but with
whom you get married.

38
00:04:50,595 --> 00:04:54,396
I have been lucky.
- So do I.

39
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:58,858
Do you still feel
lucky? Despite everything?

40
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:02,207
I'm lucky because of everything.

41
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:06,730
You are everything to me.
In adversity and adversity.

42
00:05:09,202 --> 00:05:16,043
I hoped it would work.
The church was close by.

43
00:05:16,205 --> 00:05:18,491
Maybe next month.

44
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:38,781
You promised to try.
- I can't write a diary.

45
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:43,008
It is not a diary
but a letter to yourself.

46
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:47,374
Maybe if we wrote
about our thoughts and feelings -

47
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:50,712
we would not feel so
at the mercy of destiny.

48
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:54,909
I didn't come up with anything to write.

49
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:59,384
I'm not going to talk to Sam about it.
It also applies to him -

50
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,761
and he handles the
matter in his own way.

51
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:06,304
He bought this lovely William.

52
00:06:06,463 --> 00:06:09,183
The diary has helped me.

53
00:06:09,345 --> 00:06:13,271
If you cry,
I write about my thoughts.

54
00:06:13,426 --> 00:06:18,798
However, as I write
about my thoughts, I begin to cry.

55
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:26,613
No dice. My imagination is
as fruitless as my testicle.

56
00:06:27,191 --> 00:06:29,831
Do not say that.

57
00:06:30,753 --> 00:06:34,565
I'm sorry, Lucy.
I did not mean it.

58
00:06:34,714 --> 00:06:38,321
It was a silly joke.
Everything is going to be alright.

59
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:47,493
Wait a minute,
I'll see if you ovulate first.

60
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:58,126
I was thinking of studying accounting.
- He's like a short Brad Pitt.

61
00:06:58,283 --> 00:07:03,222
We would save a lot of money.
- Short red-haired Brad Pitt.

62
00:07:03,365 --> 00:07:07,564
What if you bump into fat?
- I'll take the baby to work.

63
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:12,131
No can do! No
milk leaking breasts are needed here .

64
00:07:12,288 --> 00:07:16,283
Under European law, you are
obliged to arrange treatment.

65
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,056
Shut up, you fool!

66
00:07:20,411 --> 00:07:23,871
I'm a vegetarian
and heroin use have finished.

67
00:07:24,013 --> 00:07:28,189
I’m not on chicken
but on tofur granules.

68
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:31,817
Ota kokokuvaa.

69
00:07:31,976 --> 00:07:37,632
Heroin stuff before 9 p.m.
- The new boss wants that.

70
00:07:37,778 --> 00:07:41,670
Drug jokes to the top.
- You should like Nigel.

71
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:46,713
Should make more movies.
- Rewind to the vomiting site.

72
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:52,597
I thought you wanted to write a
movie. Here is your chance.

73
00:07:52,743 --> 00:07:56,476
Lucy says
little Cuthbert is wonderful.

74
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:02,429
He cannot speak, drink milk
or control his gut.

75
00:08:03,627 --> 00:08:05,243
Hello?

76
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:09,121
Those don't work here.
- Duty calls.

77
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,038
I have to leave control in
your hands, George.

78
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:20,212
It's a matter of care. Cut for
a couple of minutes, then on the beer.

79
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,650
This is Cuthbert.

80
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,794
I'll call him a plum,
you'll probably see why.

81
00:08:39,961 --> 00:08:43,729
I would laugh, but I would tear the stitches
that were put in after I got him.

82
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:47,411
You should have greased your
perineum with Vaseline.

83
00:08:50,645 --> 00:08:55,095
Is there an animal in that?
- Just a little chicken broth.

84
00:08:55,247 --> 00:09:00,494
It is not worth eating. Decaying
meat stays in the intestine for a month.

85
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:05,054
You can’t get pregnant
if you’re full of rotten meat!

86
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:10,412
How's work going, Sam?
- He hates his job.

87
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:16,104
You think life flies past you.
- Relationships require sacrifices.

88
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:20,352
Women sacrifice the most.
Now think of Lucy, too.

89
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:25,868
You didn't graduate, did you? - I read
Shakespeare by distance learning.

90
00:09:26,018 --> 00:09:31,219
I don’t have a brain anymore,
just a mushroom full of milk.

91
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:37,265
If you have a problem,
Sam, it's up to you.

92
00:09:37,423 --> 00:09:42,863
It's not anyone else's fault.
You must not stand in the way of your happiness.

93
00:09:43,025 --> 00:09:48,943
My hands just miss.
I have to look at my innermost being.

94
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:51,556
But I don't have one.

95
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:55,424
Write about something you know.
- I do not know anything about anything.

96
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,992
Write about your feelings.
- I do not feel anything.

97
00:09:59,151 --> 00:10:03,874
That's God's way of saying -

98
00:10:04,033 --> 00:10:09,359
you are not a writer.
- Don't listen to him.

99
00:10:09,515 --> 00:10:13,998
I'm serious, Lucy.
Western culture is the only -

100
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:18,401
who has lost all his
fertility rituals.

101
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:25,496
The only culture where the
birth rate is declining. Hello!

102
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:30,580
Now we have to ... Listen!
- I'm listening.

103
00:10:30,723 --> 00:10:36,527
We need to harness the
ancient power and mystique of your vagina .

104
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:42,216
The air is full of
pagan spirits.

105
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:46,749
There are them everywhere. Why not
take advantage of them?

106
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:50,326
Court! Court!

107
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,413
Do not laugh.

108
00:10:53,931 --> 00:10:59,303
It may have worked. I can't
leave anything untried.

109
00:10:59,454 --> 00:11:03,141
Druscilla talked about
alternative therapies.

110
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,823
Visualization group,
aromatherapy massage.

111
00:11:06,976 --> 00:11:12,507
If you fuck a character in Dorset on the
penis can get pregnant.

112
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:16,903
Is there anything closer, like
Brent Cross?

113
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,180
Primrose Hill has
some good power lines.

114
00:11:21,342 --> 00:11:28,045
Let's find out one thing: I
guess you're not going crazy?

115
00:11:28,985 --> 00:11:31,237
Do you?

116
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:38,482
Cheers, Carl. We are glad
you decided to choose us.

117
00:11:38,628 --> 00:11:44,512
Thank you, Sheila. After this silly
celebrity chore -

118
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:48,438
I have felt
more product than the actor.

119
00:11:48,592 --> 00:11:52,792
I want to grow up as an actor,
take on challenges.

120
00:11:52,954 --> 00:11:58,155
The dream of a
summer night is made Welsh in North Wales.

121
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:00,477
At least it's challenging.

122
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:07,522
I want a job that is in London,
mostly in English.

123
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,564
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Or en francais ... Tai italiaanoksi.

124
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:16,773
No niin, Carl ... Welcome.

125
00:12:24,766 --> 00:12:30,695
Should I dress like this?
We just look like Addams Family.

126
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:36,538
We need to bring out our
ancient sexuality.

127
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,535
Like timeless
horny animals.

128
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:44,341
For God's sake.
- What?

129
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:51,286
I stepped to largest dog
a row, upon which I have seen.

130
00:12:51,456 --> 00:12:55,689
There is no guarantee of a mortal
dog. I sank to my knees.

131
00:12:55,857 --> 00:13:01,138
Shut up, Sam! - An
elephant who escaped from the zoo .

132
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:04,759
I didn't like these shoes.

133
00:13:21,987 --> 00:13:26,756
Isn't it beautiful?
- Yes it is.

134
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:30,084
This makes you feel
so small.

135
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,793
But what
we came here to do -

136
00:13:33,952 --> 00:13:38,105
is as large
as the universe itself.

137
00:13:39,474 --> 00:13:42,069
New life, Sam.

138
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:19,810
It was wonderful.
- The knees just hurt.

139
00:14:19,969 --> 00:14:25,466
It is reminiscent of a scene from a
Midsummer Night’s Dream.

140
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:31,142
Is there sex under the power line
? - No, I mean magic.

141
00:14:31,293 --> 00:14:36,824
Hermia and Lysander fall asleep in
the enchanted forest next to each other.

142
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:40,184
Do you remember that point?
- Twilight.

143
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:44,024
I remember reading
sonnets to me.

144
00:14:44,178 --> 00:14:49,300
I tried to impress.
You don't go to that thread anymore.

145
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,988
Pants on the leg
so we are not arrested.

146
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:06,387
Film is the
art of the millennium . British films are in.

147
00:15:06,546 --> 00:15:10,154
Last year, three films
gained popularity in the United States.

148
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:14,666
What am I trying to say?
Can you guess?

149
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:19,825
We should make movies.
- Thank you, George.

150
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:24,316
I need scripts,
smart and provocative.

151
00:15:24,473 --> 00:15:28,957
Hands that define
the spirit of time. Follow the signs.

152
00:15:31,036 --> 00:15:32,856
"Thank you, George."

153
00:15:33,316 --> 00:15:34,932
Come now.

154
00:15:35,077 --> 00:15:39,175
The green light is on.
My heat is optimal.

155
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:43,393
I guess I didn't interrupt anything?
- Not really.

156
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:49,046
Let's get started then.

157
00:15:52,404 --> 00:15:55,989
Where has it gone?

158
00:15:56,885 --> 00:16:00,345
Yes, it still excites me about this.

159
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:11,048
Is anything going on there?
- Certainly not if you ask about it.

160
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:15,023
In the morning, a
towel could have been hung on it!

161
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:18,734
Anyone gets it
when they don’t want it.

162
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:23,616
The door knobs of the bouncy castle
are also harder.

163
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:29,978
Do I breathe a little life into it?
- If it doesn't hurt.

164
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,224
Well done, my orh.
- I think it should be taken care of.

165
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:46,584
Do you have to land around? Do my
sperm just swim downhill?

166
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:49,407
We must use
all means.

167
00:16:49,545 --> 00:16:53,699
Do you have to leave already?
- I have to go to work too.

168
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:58,943
BBC's main lunches.
- It feels so mechanical.

169
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:03,956
According to Druscilla, a gentle massage
promotes fertility.

170
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:07,206
Drusc has a crazy witch-akka.
Where are my socks?

171
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:12,269
It would be nice if there was
more mystique and romance in life.

172
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:15,734
Right, mysticism. Gotcha.

173
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:26,000
Hi, I'm Sam Bell.
How are you? Nice to meet you.

174
00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:31,688
Sam ... If the BBC is serious about
producing comedies -

175
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:34,731
Kiss My Ark is the company
you want to work with.

176
00:17:34,882 --> 00:17:40,004
Two words: Zeit and Geist.
- Tomorrow's comedy today.

177
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:44,387
Well done. That's what the
new production manager wants.

178
00:17:46,246 --> 00:17:52,131
Sick Junkie is a comedy about
just ordinary young people.

179
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:58,025
Everyone is a junkie.
Welsh, Irish, Scots.

180
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:03,852
We follow
their weekdays for a week .

181
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:08,338
They cannon heroin in their
eyes, giving birth in toilets.

182
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:14,379
They get AIDS and look for an
intact vein in their genitals.

183
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:19,704
Kill a social worker,
buy stuff for anal sex.

184
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:23,751
The stuff has been mixed with
bleach and they will die.

185
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,100
Do abortions.
They are being raped by the police.

186
00:18:28,262 --> 00:18:33,873
Do I understand correctly now?
So this should be a comedy?

187
00:18:34,024 --> 00:18:38,053
It’s a full comedy,
but based on reality.

188
00:18:38,226 --> 00:18:44,906
What really happens, and
no escapist shit.

189
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:46,991
Thank you.

190
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:53,147
It’s not about whether I
shouldn’t. Not at all.

191
00:18:54,752 --> 00:18:59,111
"I hate" is closer to the truth.
- Well that's good.

192
00:18:59,274 --> 00:19:03,325
Not in this case.
- What do you mean?

193
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:10,546
I don’t think the BBC’s job is to
fund cynical stories -

194
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:13,563
depicting
real life -

195
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:20,048
so that the fashion pellets that make them
can jump to work in the US.

196
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:26,965
That hell of
an English soap.

197
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:31,176
Do you want a movie or not?

198
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:35,495
I will contact.

199
00:19:36,488 --> 00:19:40,175
I wish Sam was more romantic.

200
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:46,088
I don't want any Carl Phips -
not that he's a Pull -

201
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:52,693
However, he smiles so lovely
even though I am a poor thing.

202
00:19:53,494 --> 00:19:57,466
You look great, Lucy,
if I may say so.

203
00:19:58,136 --> 00:20:04,794
After all, I was just wearing
a short skirt and a tight top.

204
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:09,343
I looked awful.
Stupid to claim anything else.

205
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:15,300
Am I massaging you now?

206
00:20:17,823 --> 00:20:20,907
Rose and iris
promote estrogen production.

207
00:20:21,064 --> 00:20:26,596
Rub gently but vigorously
on the back and back.

208
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:32,915
Rub gently. I'm not
dough. - I'm thinking about something else.

209
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:38,876
Before, you liked my ass.
- It's not a question.

210
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:44,596
I just have worries.
- So you don't like me.

211
00:20:45,674 --> 00:20:50,648
You’d be sure to rub the
oil on Cameron Diaz’s butt.

212
00:20:51,276 --> 00:20:56,762
Maybe, in theory.
- Do so. Don't let me stop.

213
00:20:57,238 --> 00:21:03,566
I'm not going to do that. - But
she's charming to you.

214
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:09,684
It doesn't matter. Charm
does not mean infidelity.

215
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:15,169
So you want other women.
- I don't want to.

216
00:21:15,325 --> 00:21:21,539
The fact that men are faithful
is proof of love.

217
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:28,061
If you’re about desperate,
then just let go.

218
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:37,941
I book tickets for the Frenzy of Love
show at the Barbican.

219
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:44,467
I am writing an essay for a
Shakespeare course.

220
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:48,098
For God's sake, do
you do it voluntarily?

221
00:21:48,257 --> 00:21:54,073
You don't want to join? - It would be nicer to
watch the paint dry.

222
00:21:58,341 --> 00:22:01,573
Sam...

223
00:22:01,742 --> 00:22:08,162
I would like to talk about our sex life
and having a child.

224
00:22:09,425 --> 00:22:15,708
Basically the same thing.
That doesn't bother me.

225
00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:22,070
We have a problem.
It's time to go to the doctor.

226
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:26,430
Psychologically, it's a
pretty big step.

227
00:22:26,592 --> 00:22:33,284
We may have to admit
we don’t have children.

228
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:37,756
We don't have children.

229
00:22:44,598 --> 00:22:46,908
Alan likes him.

230
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:52,769
I need to give a sperm sample.
- I do not want to know.

231
00:22:52,922 --> 00:22:59,090
Don't sober up. You have produced a
giant baby, Cuthbert.

232
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:04,286
Sperm is like a fart.
It doesn’t matter if it’s yours.

233
00:23:07,847 --> 00:23:14,141
If only I fail and I find out
there are no coincidences in the swamps.

234
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,828
Motherfucker!
- How do you know?

235
00:23:16,971 --> 00:23:21,853
I just found out you loved
Ewan Proclaimer.

236
00:23:22,012 --> 00:23:25,336
You proud asshole too.
Proclaimer is the latest peak.

237
00:23:25,494 --> 00:23:30,559
He is a God-given antidote
to the bull produced by your department.

238
00:23:30,696 --> 00:23:36,534
Why did you love him?
- Because his idea was bad.

239
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:40,465
I made a favorite decision.
I guess that's my job?

240
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:44,694
Yes, it's your job.
For now.

241
00:23:44,861 --> 00:23:49,186
You are jealous.
Where is your own script?

242
00:23:49,503 --> 00:23:53,702
Where is Sam Bell’s masterpiece?
Nowhere.

243
00:23:53,864 --> 00:23:57,916
In the same place you
are and where you are going.

244
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:08,156
I messed up my cause at work.

245
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:12,794
I might lose my job.
- Oh no.

246
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:18,688
Maybe everything will turn out for the best
. Maybe it's an opportunity.

247
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:24,285
An opportunity to do what
you want. - I want to write again.

248
00:24:24,436 --> 00:24:27,281
I just don't know where.

249
00:24:27,437 --> 00:24:29,474
What happened?

250
00:24:29,638 --> 00:24:33,587
Did that hurt?
- I fell with my bike...

251
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:37,401
Don't touch my son!
You must not touch my son.

252
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:43,251
Don't be paranoid now!
He was just trying to help.

253
00:24:45,604 --> 00:24:48,836
Damn.

254
00:24:49,005 --> 00:24:54,206
For some, the world revolves only
around their beloved children.

255
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,542
I wouldn't be like that.

256
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:02,370
Except, of course, you would.
- Probably.

257
00:25:09,253 --> 00:25:12,143
If I had the chance.

258
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:21,233
Now I came up with!
- What?

259
00:25:22,578 --> 00:25:25,787
A topic to write about.

260
00:25:25,939 --> 00:25:30,913
I should write about us.
A comedy about a childless couple.

261
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:35,553
Of course! A modern
tragicomic story -

262
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:38,548
life and its absence.

263
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:42,471
Sad jokes,
they are the best.

264
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:47,052
About sperm tests and
imagination exercises.

265
00:25:47,187 --> 00:25:53,150
The couple's sex life breaks down, the
woman only thinks of the baby.

266
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:58,157
She cries when she sees the
baby clothes. - No, Sam.

267
00:25:58,311 --> 00:26:03,671
Don't like the idea?
- How can you even consider that?

268
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:07,976
No, you're right.
It was a silly idea.

269
00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:13,441
I just wouldn't stand it.
- Why should I.

270
00:26:15,998 --> 00:26:18,365
But you said
I should look inside.

271
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:23,254
I did not ask to make our
tragedy a laughing stock.

272
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:28,370
That's right, you don't.

273
00:26:33,204 --> 00:26:37,449
What could Carl read
at the gala for the warriors ?

274
00:26:37,606 --> 00:26:41,054
You know Shakespeare, don't you?

275
00:26:41,207 --> 00:26:46,146
It must not be too gloomy.
The subject is love.

276
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:51,411
The gala being televised should
be positive and sexy.

277
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:56,863
Don't Sheila now.
- Don't forget to think about your career.

278
00:26:57,013 --> 00:27:02,544
Lucy? - Would an
eighteenth sonnet fit ?

279
00:27:02,695 --> 00:27:05,460
It's a little sweet -

280
00:27:05,616 --> 00:27:09,270
but the most beautiful love poem
ever written.

281
00:27:09,418 --> 00:27:15,461
How does it go?
- You must have heard it.

282
00:27:18,141 --> 00:27:21,498
Sua summer day would I compare

283
00:27:21,662 --> 00:27:26,636
But you are gentler

284
00:27:26,784 --> 00:27:30,096
Spring wind buds grate

285
00:27:30,266 --> 00:27:34,988
And summer time is too short

286
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:41,505
May the eye of heaven
burn hot

287
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:45,984
So often its splendor dims

288
00:27:46,152 --> 00:27:49,998
And everything beautiful will eventually disappear

289
00:27:50,153 --> 00:27:56,402
Coincidentally or through destiny

290
00:27:58,556 --> 00:28:02,870
But your eternal summer

291
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:07,682
Never fade away

292
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,210
You never go in the shadow of death

293
00:28:12,362 --> 00:28:17,255
When you grow into eternal beauty

294
00:28:18,004 --> 00:28:24,491
Wrong number. - As long
as the person is breathing

295
00:28:24,646 --> 00:28:31,578
So live this
And give you life

296
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:39,535
You're about to turn me
back straight, Phipps.

297
00:28:39,692 --> 00:28:41,991
Thanks for the tip, Lucy.

298
00:28:43,493 --> 00:28:49,183
You are so wonderful ...
When you help these orphaned children.

299
00:28:49,616 --> 00:28:51,231
So.

300
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,907
Are you going to sleep soon?
- Soon.

301
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:10,989
Don't monitor too late.
There is an early meeting tomorrow.

302
00:29:11,144 --> 00:29:13,636
How could I forget?

303
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:18,872
Do you want me to help?
- Thank you for the offer -

304
00:29:19,027 --> 00:29:24,706
but the seriousness of the situation
requires the expertise of an expert.

305
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:30,685
Alright.
Then think of me. - Women!

306
00:29:30,831 --> 00:29:34,963
Can a man be unfaithful when
he is alone?

307
00:29:35,113 --> 00:29:38,277
You think Cameron Diaz.

308
00:29:38,434 --> 00:29:45,239
Did I! According to some psychologists
, a lively imagination -

309
00:29:45,396 --> 00:29:48,913
is
an important part of a monogamous relationship.

310
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:52,480
I will not discuss this further.

311
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,607
According to the invitation, Steffi Graf,
the girls of Corrs and Baby Spice.

312
00:30:00,962 --> 00:30:05,446
I'm sorry
about the film-from the idea -

313
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:09,371
but I guess you understand?
- Sure, of course.

314
00:30:09,526 --> 00:30:12,121
Good night.

315
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:17,134
Am I taking this to the bathroom?
- Yes please.

316
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:28,930
Tomorrow I'll give you a sperm sample

317
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:32,495
And the cup is waiting on the shelf

318
00:30:35,095 --> 00:30:38,452
Tomorrow I'll give you a sperm sample

319
00:30:38,616 --> 00:30:41,849
And the cup is waiting on the shelf

320
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:48,514
I sit in the bathroom

321
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:52,837
And I pollute myself

322
00:31:17,551 --> 00:31:19,554
Less than I hoped.

323
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:23,763
Did you get everything to come?
- As much as I could.

324
00:31:23,913 --> 00:31:27,191
What a disappointment.
Like a little bird sneezing.

325
00:31:27,355 --> 00:31:31,508
If only I would continue it
with water and flour.

326
00:31:31,676 --> 00:31:36,718
Would not it? Best left. It must
be taken within 5O minutes.

327
00:31:36,878 --> 00:31:42,489
In pants, it stays warm.
I hope I don't get under the car.

328
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:46,882
Bye then.

329
00:31:47,362 --> 00:31:50,595
Taxi!

330
00:31:50,764 --> 00:31:55,839
I have an important meeting.
- I have sperm in my ass.

331
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:09,008
Sam Bell.
I have delivery.

332
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:17,405
Let it go deep ... I got it.

333
00:32:23,136 --> 00:32:24,854
Good morning.

334
00:32:25,217 --> 00:32:27,265
So for the sake of the Creator.

335
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:32,231
When he was younger,
he was a master of masturbation.

336
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:38,320
Now he is like being
hanged from his testicles.

337
00:32:38,461 --> 00:32:44,835
But does Sam support you?
I guess he'll take your needs into account?

338
00:32:44,984 --> 00:32:50,265
Of course.
She is wonderful, in her own way.

339
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:54,272
Look, there's Carl Phipps!
- Where?

340
00:32:57,669 --> 00:33:03,382
Sorry, my plate is dirty.
I guess that's my main course.

341
00:33:03,551 --> 00:33:08,707
This then is a film art
genius who thinks that I am -

342
00:33:08,873 --> 00:33:12,196
"tasteless, cynical
exploiter."

343
00:33:12,354 --> 00:33:16,508
So the fax arrived.
- Ewan Proclaimer, George.

344
00:33:16,676 --> 00:33:18,759
Hey.
- What's up dude.

345
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:23,139
When was the last time you
wrote, my backward Englishman?

346
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:26,568
You never, right?
And why?

347
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,815
Because you are a talented piston.

348
00:33:29,961 --> 00:33:36,846
A parasite that fattens the
ass to the spikes of others -

349
00:33:37,003 --> 00:33:40,338
and wishes himself a better
fucking hell.

350
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:44,422
About well no one
could say that, dude.

351
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:49,460
It was a great hand, of course ...
- It's shit and I threw it away.

352
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:55,139
I already knew it before you
but nonetheless -

353
00:33:55,290 --> 00:34:01,459
My shit shit on
your shit because I even write something.

354
00:34:01,613 --> 00:34:08,271
You tell
shit writers they write shit.

355
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:12,023
You're pretty pathetic.

356
00:34:12,537 --> 00:34:15,382
Bastard.

357
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:20,418
I will disappear.
- I like him.

358
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,312
Great color choice, by the way.

359
00:34:27,062 --> 00:34:31,876
You look first.
- This is not a final exam.

360
00:34:36,346 --> 00:34:40,750
The result of the blood test is good.
I was apparently ovulating.

361
00:34:40,907 --> 00:34:45,801
Then the fault is in me.
I am a eunuch.

362
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:48,919
Look, I can't.

363
00:34:52,232 --> 00:34:56,237
"Samuel Bell's sperm sample:
30% lazy."

364
00:34:56,393 --> 00:35:00,559
"Lazy"?
Is that the word they use?

365
00:35:00,715 --> 00:35:05,814
Why not "relaxed"
or "unhurried"?

366
00:35:05,957 --> 00:35:10,487
Casual sperm would be rockier.
- "Low mobility."

367
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:14,485
That's already outrageous!

368
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,329
"41% are moving in the wrong direction."
- They're in a plastic jar!

369
00:35:19,482 --> 00:35:25,969
There is no right direction in that.
Sperm is lazy and stupid.

370
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:32,418
For years I
stumbled back and forth towards my cock.

371
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:37,939
"Assessment: Normal."
So here it is said.

372
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:41,139
Your sperm is no worse
than anyone else.

373
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:44,898
Great!

374
00:35:45,052 --> 00:35:48,181
The score is now 1-0.
Sperm test passed.

375
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:54,547
Developable but
good result at this point.

376
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:07,541
Would you go for lunch?

377
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:12,704
Carl Phipps came into the office
and was as gloomy as Byron.

378
00:36:12,862 --> 00:36:16,834
He was like a gloomy lord whose
castle has been deprived of him.

379
00:36:16,984 --> 00:36:20,079
Her aftershave
smells like Kanerva!

380
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:22,582
I was as cool
as a file.

381
00:36:23,506 --> 00:36:27,524
You are nice when you ask,
but I'm here alone today.

382
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:31,275
Sheila has bronchitis
. As a medicine, set 4O.

383
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:35,629
He coughed something
that looked like a pond dweller.

384
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:41,038
Joanna is in Los with Trudi Hobson
. Some action movie.

385
00:36:41,193 --> 00:36:47,794
A sequel
called Shit 2 or something.

386
00:36:48,675 --> 00:36:54,001
Everyone has the right to a
lunch break. - Yes, it is.

387
00:36:54,158 --> 00:36:59,689
I'm celebrating. An American
big movie. Want to chat.

388
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:05,053
Aromatic oils ...
I took the course once.

389
00:37:05,202 --> 00:37:08,923
Therapeutic massage.
I have an official qualification.

390
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:12,953
In Shiatsu
and reflexology as well.

391
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:21,104
I don’t get enough of
alternative therapies. Beautiful.

392
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,613
This is really nice,
but if you want to party -

393
00:37:30,771 --> 00:37:34,425
Don’t want to party with someone
important?

394
00:37:34,573 --> 00:37:36,336
That's what I do.

395
00:37:36,493 --> 00:37:41,387
Creator! My neck starts
to itch again.

396
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:47,829
As a teenager, if the boy approached, the
neck was immediately reddish.

397
00:37:49,258 --> 00:37:52,467
What do you mean, Carl?

398
00:37:53,700 --> 00:38:00,414
Unbelievable that I write like this,
but he caressed my palm -

399
00:38:00,582 --> 00:38:07,582
which, as far as I know, means,
"I would love to put you now."

400
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:21,438
And why do birds have
such naughty names?

401
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:25,153
Haarapääsky, punarinta ...

402
00:38:26,272 --> 00:38:29,709
Is he more fun or have I
just stopped resisting?

403
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:34,790
Lucy and I are having a post-
intercourse test.

404
00:38:34,955 --> 00:38:40,406
After having sex, the
doctor looks at the aftermath.

405
00:38:40,558 --> 00:38:45,167
Why do you think
I want to know that?

406
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:20,078
Your doctor will see you
now.

407
00:39:26,175 --> 00:39:32,059
Pooter is a medical student.
Does it matter if he watches?

408
00:39:32,217 --> 00:39:36,154
Of course I want
some silly teenager -

409
00:39:36,298 --> 00:39:40,293
tuck open the
applied vagina.

410
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,840
No, of course not.

411
00:39:44,261 --> 00:39:46,594
Good.

412
00:39:46,742 --> 00:39:50,430
This, Pooter,
we do not need today.

413
00:39:50,584 --> 00:39:53,986
This may be necessary later.

414
00:39:54,145 --> 00:39:57,035
And this is necessary.

415
00:40:00,588 --> 00:40:06,756
On a moped, I save 17 minutes
every day. Admittedly, I say that.

416
00:40:30,999 --> 00:40:35,404
See how everything is ...

417
00:40:41,403 --> 00:40:43,884
Try to relax, Lucy.

418
00:40:44,044 --> 00:40:48,654
Try to relax yourself with a
trumpet in your ass.

419
00:40:48,806 --> 00:40:51,571
I try.

420
00:40:53,888 --> 00:40:55,719
That was it.

421
00:40:55,888 --> 00:41:01,852
There is now a little
slipperiness at the lower end , due to the ointment.

422
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:07,614
Don't be embarrassed, it was me.

423
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:29,534
A children's program?
- Exactly. Tea water for children.

424
00:41:30,261 --> 00:41:35,075
We aim to develop light
entertainment in this area.

425
00:41:35,223 --> 00:41:40,834
You want me out, but this
is cheaper than firing.

426
00:41:46,147 --> 00:41:49,801
Hello? Melinda!
Now doesn't really fit ...

427
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:52,958
Oh no.

428
00:41:53,870 --> 00:42:00,198
Suspected meningitis.
We will only receive the information later.

429
00:42:00,993 --> 00:42:05,887
Nothing is known now.
Thanks for coming.

430
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:16,565
I was right.
I lost my job.

431
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,121
We don’t have to starve,
I move on to children’s programs.

432
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,857
Melinda may lose her child.
- I know. What can we do?

433
00:42:27,283 --> 00:42:31,277
We do nothing.

434
00:42:33,805 --> 00:42:38,130
If we are childless,
there is no need to endure such a thing.

435
00:42:38,287 --> 00:42:43,693
Yes, think positively!
- I'm not that ...

436
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:50,252
How else did it go?

437
00:42:50,411 --> 00:42:55,225
How did the test go?
- Well, it went well.

438
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:59,550
Medically,
we are compatible.

439
00:43:05,577 --> 00:43:08,456
Hey, Lucy.
Sheila and Joanna are ...

440
00:43:09,098 --> 00:43:11,943
You have cried. What's wrong?

441
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:16,344
My friend's child may die.
Suspected meningitis.

442
00:43:16,501 --> 00:43:19,585
Come sit here.

443
00:43:23,704 --> 00:43:28,643
The majority of suspected
cases are just that:

444
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:30,629
doubts.

445
00:43:30,787 --> 00:43:36,557
How do you know that?
- I've starred in the doctor sometimes.

446
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:40,783
In these cases, the symptoms are
often quite vague.

447
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:46,652
Sometimes the right cause doesn’t figure out, the
baby just gets better.

448
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:52,438
Babies are tenacious. Brave ...

449
00:43:52,595 --> 00:43:55,520
Although they don't look like it.

450
00:44:09,641 --> 00:44:12,076
Carl, I ...

451
00:44:12,242 --> 00:44:16,806
I like you, Lucy.
Too much, I guess.

452
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:24,188
From now on, I will try to keep
more distance between us.

453
00:44:24,887 --> 00:44:27,607
That's the best thing.

454
00:44:30,889 --> 00:44:35,464
If you want to chat ...

455
00:44:37,011 --> 00:44:38,764
Okay?

456
00:44:44,374 --> 00:44:48,426
Do you want a piece of cake,
Mrs. Turriainen?

457
00:44:48,576 --> 00:44:52,343
Us us.
Hall hall.

458
00:44:52,497 --> 00:44:58,791
I don’t like that the Turrians
live a completely heterosexual life.

459
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:05,188
What do you think, Sam?
You're the boss. You decide.

460
00:45:05,342 --> 00:45:11,465
We need to negotiate with
the target group.

461
00:45:13,985 --> 00:45:18,265
Well. Thank you for coming.

462
00:45:18,427 --> 00:45:22,798
You make us a
television channel.

463
00:45:22,949 --> 00:45:28,071
The BBC is yours.

464
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:34,313
So ... Do you have any comments?

465
00:45:36,754 --> 00:45:38,677
Anything.

466
00:45:41,316 --> 00:45:43,933
Is there any other little damage?

467
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:55,333
That's what you see.
They really like you.

468
00:46:31,174 --> 00:46:35,738
Why are you awake?
What are you writing?

469
00:46:37,056 --> 00:46:42,052
I didn’t get to sleep and thought to
write in my diary.

470
00:46:43,379 --> 00:46:47,066
As you said: a
letter to myself.

471
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,352
Can I read it?
- Absolutely not.

472
00:46:51,502 --> 00:46:57,033
I know it's private.
I would die if you read mine.

473
00:46:57,184 --> 00:47:00,222
I'm going to sleep now.

474
00:47:08,788 --> 00:47:13,068
Some have sex on a
lime man’s penis.

475
00:47:24,714 --> 00:47:29,119
The heat has finally dropped.
- That's good!

476
00:47:29,276 --> 00:47:35,524
Maybe I’m reminded like this
that I can’t live without him.

477
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:44,882
That's fantastic.
Gloomy, dramatic ...

478
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:49,526
When did you write this?
- You know how creative I am.

479
00:47:49,684 --> 00:47:51,892
Sorry I'm late.

480
00:47:52,045 --> 00:47:55,049
Cuthbert is reportedly safe.
- Not from me.

481
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:58,335
He returned my Baumler suit.

482
00:47:58,487 --> 00:48:02,437
Everyone has liked your hand
.

483
00:48:02,609 --> 00:48:06,535
How does Lucy feel?
This is pretty personal.

484
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:11,379
As the back side of the pads below.
- Miracle that you can write.

485
00:48:11,532 --> 00:48:17,530
He has not given permission.
He asked to forget the story.

486
00:48:18,415 --> 00:48:23,855
He will kill you.
- But I couldn't forget the thing.

487
00:48:24,057 --> 00:48:27,824
I hate my job.
Have you seen the Turrias?

488
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:30,624
Cuthbert doesn't want to watch it.

489
00:48:30,779 --> 00:48:35,184
The script is the best
thing I've done in years.

490
00:48:35,341 --> 00:48:39,666
Lucy understands.
That's my story, too.

491
00:48:42,984 --> 00:48:46,466
Another one? I can't anymore.

492
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:51,872
Forced. The test tube in fertilization
has its own tests.

493
00:48:52,027 --> 00:48:56,409
It is not the end of the world.
You don't have to fuck a hedgehog.

494
00:48:56,549 --> 00:49:00,646
I'm
undergoing hysterosalpingography!

495
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:06,277
I masturbate in public.
What could be more awful?

496
00:49:06,433 --> 00:49:12,522
Application and scraping,
cold metal objects -

497
00:49:12,675 --> 00:49:14,644
and be pumped
full of air.

498
00:49:14,796 --> 00:49:21,215
UK every doctor
staring at her pussy on a daily basis.

499
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,510
Oh, you're invoking that woman thing.

500
00:49:34,363 --> 00:49:38,461
Will William have fleas?
You scrape yourself all the time.

501
00:49:38,885 --> 00:49:44,371
It just tickles me at certain
points. Probably an allergy.

502
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:52,606
Nowadays, he
just wants to write in his diary.

503
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:56,970
I should be happy
when he deals with his feelings -

504
00:49:57,132 --> 00:50:01,661
If only he would share
them with me.

505
00:50:01,813 --> 00:50:05,535
You don't have
to fuck a hedgehog.

506
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:12,455
Whether you are suddenly excited.
- I just want to get acquainted.

507
00:50:12,617 --> 00:50:15,873
I didn’t even know
what laparoscopy was before.

508
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:18,477
Damn.

509
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:22,387
I forgot to shave my bikini line.

510
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:28,870
That sounds ridiculous,
but I want to look good.

511
00:50:30,304 --> 00:50:35,221
That's good. That's fun.
- It's not fun, Sam.

512
00:50:35,386 --> 00:50:39,996
The whole thing is humiliating.
- Of course. Sorry.

513
00:50:40,148 --> 00:50:43,676
The bed is ready,
Mrs. Bell.

514
00:50:43,829 --> 00:50:46,924
Wish luck.
- Good luck.

515
00:50:58,035 --> 00:51:02,905
Laparoscopy, shave bikini line.
Looks good.

516
00:51:06,998 --> 00:51:12,563
You have great guts.
Beautiful, really beautiful.

517
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:18,592
And a large colon too.
Definitely works great.

518
00:51:18,762 --> 00:51:22,097
Large, porous stools.
Well done.

519
00:51:22,244 --> 00:51:26,090
What do we have here?

520
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:32,966
Endometriosis,
abdominal attachment -

521
00:51:33,128 --> 00:51:38,420
malignant fibroids,
cyst, abdominal disease -

522
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:41,972
congenital defect in the womb ...
- Dear time!

523
00:51:42,131 --> 00:51:47,457
And you don't have any of them.
And excellent intestines.

524
00:51:47,613 --> 00:51:51,346
You’ve just ovulated,
which is great news.

525
00:51:51,495 --> 00:51:55,182
Omelettes cannot be
made without eggs.

526
00:51:55,336 --> 00:51:59,308
By omelet I mean baby.

527
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:05,665
That was it. Everything looks
good, there is nothing wrong.

528
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:08,153
I'm not pregnant.

529
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:13,548
Except you're not pregnant.
We don't know why you don't -

530
00:52:13,703 --> 00:52:17,835
but that is good news.
- Is it?

531
00:52:17,985 --> 00:52:23,198
You could have had a
Pavarotti-sized cyst.

532
00:52:23,347 --> 00:52:29,151
Everything feminine should have been
removed from the sides to the knees.

533
00:52:29,309 --> 00:52:34,283
It is called unexplained
infertility.

534
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:40,212
Or in technical terms:
no damn smell.

535
00:52:40,353 --> 00:52:43,835
Very ordinary
space, indeed.

536
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:48,171
In the
world of unintentional infertility, therefore.

537
00:52:50,037 --> 00:52:53,439
Is it too wonderful?
- No, that's really good.

538
00:52:53,598 --> 00:52:58,640
It's personal. - It
becomes more personal.

539
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,521
You dramatize your life,
you and Lucy.

540
00:53:02,681 --> 00:53:08,554
What happens when he finds out?
- Most ideas don't come true.

541
00:53:08,724 --> 00:53:13,640
If this is filmed,
I will think about it then.

542
00:53:13,806 --> 00:53:18,824
Until then, it’s a crazy dream
and we have permission to dream.

543
00:53:18,967 --> 00:53:20,890
Is not it true?

544
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:27,693
The door is open.

545
00:53:27,851 --> 00:53:29,865
Hey.

546
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:40,127
Welcome.

547
00:53:40,295 --> 00:53:45,257
I included an agreement
you wanted to discuss with me.

548
00:53:45,417 --> 00:53:48,262
That's what I said to Sheila.

549
00:53:49,779 --> 00:53:53,386
It's a standard contract,
quite simple.

550
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:56,989
It is a
standard contract.

551
00:53:57,142 --> 00:54:01,831
I am not interested in the agreement
. - Sheila said that ...

552
00:54:01,984 --> 00:54:04,954
I know what I said.

553
00:54:06,545 --> 00:54:12,794
What do you mean?
- I wanted to be with you two.

554
00:54:14,868 --> 00:54:21,629
I'm married, I love
my husband. - You're lonely.

555
00:54:22,711 --> 00:54:27,070
I'm not.
- You are, and so am I.

556
00:54:28,113 --> 00:54:30,833
And...

557
00:54:30,995 --> 00:54:35,604
I've tried to stay away from -

558
00:54:37,437 --> 00:54:39,724
but I can not.

559
00:54:41,639 --> 00:54:44,051
Please stop ...

560
00:54:51,042 --> 00:54:56,698
Make love to me.
I'm in love with you.

561
00:54:58,125 --> 00:55:00,617
You don't mean that.

562
00:55:00,766 --> 00:55:04,737
I mean.

563
00:55:21,213 --> 00:55:23,899
I can not.

564
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:28,914
You are lovely and beautiful
but I love my husband.

565
00:55:29,056 --> 00:55:34,587
It’s not exciting,
but nothing is forever.

566
00:55:34,738 --> 00:55:36,866
Is not it?

567
00:55:37,019 --> 00:55:39,705
A sad way of thinking.

568
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:45,061
I'm sorry, I have to
go. Are you calling a taxi?

569
00:55:45,222 --> 00:55:48,273
Toki, totta kai.

570
00:55:48,424 --> 00:55:51,110
I'm sorry, Carl -

571
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:54,030
but i love my husband.

572
00:55:59,708 --> 00:56:05,273
I won't meet Carl anymore.
There is such a bad conscience.

573
00:56:06,710 --> 00:56:09,271
I don't want Carlia.

574
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:13,358
I want Sam,
he's the only one I want.

575
00:56:14,393 --> 00:56:17,546
And that we have a child.

576
00:56:18,355 --> 00:56:22,281
Dear God, if you read this:

577
00:56:22,436 --> 00:56:26,249
Let the in vitro fertilization
succeed.

578
00:56:26,398 --> 00:56:29,732
I so desperately want to
have a baby.

579
00:56:43,804 --> 00:56:47,105
There was rubbish in my eyes.

580
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:58,762
There are problems with the hand.
It's too manly.

581
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:03,574
"Manly?" -Colin
masturbation is fun -

582
00:57:03,732 --> 00:57:07,749
but Rachel worries us.
He is too superficial.

583
00:57:07,893 --> 00:57:14,142
He has good replicas,
but the perspective is masculine.

584
00:57:14,296 --> 00:57:17,619
Would we get a woman as a
second screenwriter?

585
00:57:19,218 --> 00:57:22,495
Have you gone crazy?

586
00:57:22,659 --> 00:57:27,314
Rachel can be improved,
it will be arranged.

587
00:57:27,461 --> 00:57:32,503
That's my story!
Me and Lucyn. - Exactly.

588
00:57:32,663 --> 00:57:37,785
You have to tell Lucy.
Blame the female writer for everything.

589
00:57:37,945 --> 00:57:41,871
No one robs my
script.

590
00:57:42,026 --> 00:57:47,910
Then destroy your marriage. But a
woman’s voice needs to be included.

591
00:57:48,069 --> 00:57:52,473
Leave it to me.
Was there anything else?

592
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:54,792
Would not it? Thank you.

593
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:26,975
Whatever happens, I am going to stay a
mentally healthy woman.

594
00:58:27,123 --> 00:58:30,457
I read to my child
Beatrix Potter and Winnie the Pooh.

595
00:58:30,605 --> 00:58:34,679
The gear cannot be changed
if the legs are crossed.

596
00:58:40,048 --> 00:58:45,010
I found myself looking at
baby clothes again.

597
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:48,857
Sometimes when everything
feels overwhelming -

598
00:58:51,933 --> 00:58:54,937
I pray.

599
00:59:00,816 --> 00:59:04,378
Hei, Lucy.

600
00:59:04,537 --> 00:59:07,872
Was it a nice bath?

601
00:59:09,099 --> 00:59:11,660
Good.

602
00:59:13,461 --> 00:59:16,545
Are you well?
- Yes, just fine.

603
00:59:19,303 --> 00:59:23,320
You haven't
had dandruff before.

604
00:59:24,345 --> 00:59:28,316
Psoriasis.
The skin is dry and flaky.

605
00:59:28,466 --> 00:59:31,345
It cannot be cured.
Arrested Development.

606
00:59:31,507 --> 00:59:36,242
It often strikes when there is stress.

607
00:59:36,389 --> 00:59:38,153
Do you have stress?

608
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:39,926
No!

609
00:59:40,071 --> 00:59:45,397
So nothing.
I have no worries.

610
00:59:46,393 --> 00:59:49,033
Action!
- I want freedom.

611
00:59:49,194 --> 00:59:54,088
I demand security.
- I'll do what I want.

612
00:59:54,236 --> 00:59:56,239
Tajuutteks too?

613
00:59:56,397 --> 01:00:00,084
Across. Rampant reign.

614
01:00:00,238 --> 01:00:03,049
Let's go to lunch.

615
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:08,657
Tamponimainos. To pay the bills.

616
01:00:08,801 --> 01:00:15,130
I got your hands on it. You can be a
shit dude, but talented.

617
01:00:15,284 --> 01:00:20,371
Needs healing,
but I will film it.

618
01:00:20,526 --> 01:00:24,213
When do I get the rest of the hand?

619
01:00:24,607 --> 01:00:31,288
About six weeks. This
should stop ovulation.

620
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:37,266
In a month and a half
we can be older.

621
01:00:37,412 --> 01:00:41,180
It’s best to start hiding
breakable valuables.

622
01:00:41,334 --> 01:00:48,253
Cuthbert did not
intentionally break the model. He crawls.

623
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:53,663
When not screaming,
Shit or vomit.

624
01:00:53,818 --> 01:01:00,738
That looks awful.
- I think it's the highlight of the day!

625
01:01:00,901 --> 01:01:06,557
You better get used to it.
You have to prick me too.

626
01:01:09,264 --> 01:01:12,439
That would be a funny scene.

627
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,918
What did you say?

628
01:01:15,066 --> 01:01:19,437
If anyone could see
it , it would be funny.

629
01:01:19,588 --> 01:01:23,150
If someone saw from the window.

630
01:01:27,711 --> 01:01:32,650
This thorny thing is great.
We show a peak on the screen -

631
01:01:32,793 --> 01:01:38,244
which is not a heroin spike.
So original and liberating.

632
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:44,404
It has not been done for years.
It could be more fun.

633
01:01:44,557 --> 01:01:49,451
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Even if the hormones mix with Colin's hepo store -

634
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:54,083
and Rachel would prick
them instead of drugs?

635
01:01:55,602 --> 01:02:00,677
Have fun. Except that
Colin doesn't use drugs.

636
01:02:00,844 --> 01:02:04,941
Would not it? Are you kidding me?
- En.

637
01:02:05,085 --> 01:02:11,857
Fascinating. So is it true
that you practiced pricking?

638
01:02:12,008 --> 01:02:15,649
It's true.
- Absolutely insane.

639
01:02:15,809 --> 01:02:20,976
Adults learn to
use the syringe.

640
01:02:21,131 --> 01:02:23,669
Totally unbelievable.

641
01:02:26,453 --> 01:02:29,298
The orange did not seem
to feel pain.

642
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:34,450
It shouldn’t hurt if I do
it quickly and decisively.

643
01:02:34,616 --> 01:02:36,630
Are you ready?

644
01:02:37,537 --> 01:02:39,893
One two Three...

645
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:50,189
The hallways pulsate with repressed
sexual energy.

646
01:02:50,342 --> 01:02:56,841
Love channels with doors. Add
light to make it look sterile.

647
01:02:56,985 --> 01:03:02,311
Absolute umbilical cord but
cold, calcified and dead.

648
01:03:02,467 --> 01:03:06,666
How is the division of roles going?
It's starting to be in a hurry.

649
01:03:06,828 --> 01:03:10,778
The actors are like cattle.

650
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:16,993
How old is the girl? 22? 23?
- Closer to thirty.

651
01:03:17,152 --> 01:03:21,636
Leave it undefined.
She must not be a teenager -

652
01:03:21,794 --> 01:03:24,457
but even somewhat
naive looking.

653
01:03:24,595 --> 01:03:30,149
Anything from a mature
19 year old to a young 25.

654
01:03:31,197 --> 01:03:36,091
I'm just asking you to handjob,
not marry a hedgehog.

655
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:39,369
I'm
undergoing hysterosalpingography!

656
01:03:41,721 --> 01:03:44,658
Thank you...

657
01:03:44,803 --> 01:03:50,766
Tilda Bustle. 175 cm, 75B.
Horse riding, martial arts.

658
01:03:50,925 --> 01:03:56,968
That was touching, Tilda.
You have depth.

659
01:03:58,208 --> 01:04:00,803
Thank you. Next.

660
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:10,139
Everyone is too young.
- Isn't that awful?

661
01:04:11,092 --> 01:04:15,110
Is the place booked for the
whole week? - Is.

662
01:04:15,614 --> 01:04:19,176
Good. Brilliant.

663
01:04:20,776 --> 01:04:25,613
Picture, sketch ... Use this.

664
01:04:26,258 --> 01:04:30,868
Good. I can
already see it in the eyes of my soul.

665
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:36,699
Sam! Such
needles did you use?

666
01:04:36,862 --> 01:04:43,144
It is injected into a muscle,
normally in the buttocks. It hurts.

667
01:04:43,305 --> 01:04:49,928
The name of the film should be
My Ass is an orange.

668
01:04:50,067 --> 01:04:56,680
Its name is Pure.
- Yes. For now.

669
01:05:02,352 --> 01:05:08,168
Sam is better at his job,
but not at sperm tests.

670
01:05:10,075 --> 01:05:14,149
I took the
draft contract to Carl Phipps today.

671
01:05:14,316 --> 01:05:18,641
I'm afraid it ever since
when he kissed me.

672
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:22,405
What are you doing there?
- Nothing!

673
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:26,895
He had planned it,
but it was my fault too.

674
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:29,966
I went to the
bedroom with him .

675
01:05:30,122 --> 01:05:34,140
He took off his shirt
and asked me to stay.

676
01:05:34,284 --> 01:05:38,563
I said I love my husband
and he called a taxi.

677
01:05:38,725 --> 01:05:41,570
Thank God
nothing happened.

678
01:05:41,726 --> 01:05:45,164
At least almost.

679
01:05:56,092 --> 01:05:59,824
Why are you staring at me like that?

680
01:06:15,259 --> 01:06:17,933
One last remark.
If you can.

681
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:24,815
My sperm is stupid. For years I
stumbled towards my cock.

682
01:06:24,983 --> 01:06:30,514
It’s lazy, sluggish,
and doesn’t know where to go.

683
01:06:30,665 --> 01:06:34,181
Like a tavern full of men.

684
01:06:36,947 --> 01:06:41,886
That was great, Carl.
Really great.

685
01:06:42,029 --> 01:06:46,229
It can become something.
- Petra, Justin ...

686
01:06:46,391 --> 01:06:51,478
Brilliant. Bravo.
- Thank you for coming to the test.

687
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:55,934
No one is too big.
Especially if Ewan directs.

688
01:06:56,074 --> 01:06:59,409
What an asshole.

689
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:04,521
What did you like? - In view of
the threats of rainforests -

690
01:07:04,678 --> 01:07:09,800
was
unecological to give some woody performance.

691
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:14,398
Tight, stiff ...
- Absolutely convincing my Englishman.

692
01:07:14,561 --> 01:07:17,588
Couldn’t you do something about
that psoriasis?

693
01:07:17,763 --> 01:07:22,610
The worst thing about incurable
disease is -

694
01:07:22,764 --> 01:07:27,726
that everyone knows the
cure. - Cousin had psoriasis.

695
01:07:27,886 --> 01:07:33,383
The naturalist recommended
banana peel for the entire skin.

696
01:07:33,528 --> 01:07:35,121
That's what you see.

697
01:07:35,289 --> 01:07:40,536
If you told Lucy ... - Dandruff
is more pleasant than death.

698
01:07:40,691 --> 01:07:44,413
Lucy has suggested
alternative therapies.

699
01:07:45,253 --> 01:07:50,352
Lots of mucus. Very slimy.

700
01:07:50,495 --> 01:07:54,387
Very warm inside.
Very dry, very slimy.

701
01:07:54,536 --> 01:07:57,222
Too much mucus. Too slimy.

702
01:07:57,377 --> 01:08:00,473
No tomatoes, no meat.
Plus...

703
01:08:00,619 --> 01:08:04,670
Make tea.
I saw a lot three times a day.

704
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:07,870
Then drink.

705
01:08:08,021 --> 01:08:13,347
I put six needles in
your acupuncture points -

706
01:08:13,503 --> 01:08:19,467
and twelve needles for anus.
It helps to relax.

707
01:08:21,747 --> 01:08:24,899
You are excited.

708
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:31,411
Unbelievable that all of
this is made into a movie.

709
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:35,704
Infertility is made into a
film. We got a hand.

710
01:08:35,872 --> 01:08:42,404
I didn’t read it, but embarrassed
when I stopped you from writing.

711
01:08:42,554 --> 01:08:45,810
Do you mean I
should have written about it?

712
01:08:45,956 --> 01:08:49,757
I couldn’t stand it being
based on our own lives.

713
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:53,889
It would have been
too personal.

714
01:08:56,119 --> 01:09:00,444
One of our actors, Carl
Phipps, plays a husband.

715
01:09:00,601 --> 01:09:06,975
He's definitely good.
Nice and sensitive actor.

716
01:09:09,364 --> 01:09:12,927
Sam!
- I'm sorry.

717
01:09:13,086 --> 01:09:17,946
Good God, let me get
pregnant. I want so badly.

718
01:09:18,088 --> 01:09:23,448
Would it be better
if I was closer to the camera?

719
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:26,178
Let's try.

720
01:09:28,092 --> 01:09:33,543
Good God, let me ...
- I thought I'd try a dialect.

721
01:09:34,414 --> 01:09:39,695
Just try. Start:
"You don't even want kids."

722
01:09:40,456 --> 01:09:45,111
You don't even want kids.
- Theoretically, no.

723
01:09:45,258 --> 01:09:49,025
It does not work.
- It was just an idea.

724
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:52,920
Once again,
when you're ready.

725
01:09:53,741 --> 01:09:57,839
Theoretically, I -

726
01:09:59,103 --> 01:10:04,668
but as part of you, as an
expression of our love -

727
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:07,909
i want it more
than anything else.

728
01:10:08,067 --> 01:10:12,323
But if we don't have children,
it doesn't hurt either -

729
01:10:12,468 --> 01:10:15,870
because we still
have each other.

730
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:20,195
Our love is
no less perfect.

731
01:10:23,472 --> 01:10:25,521
This is already almost perfect.

732
01:10:32,356 --> 01:10:36,873
This is an important monologue, Nimnh.

733
01:10:37,037 --> 01:10:42,159
This is the crux of the story.
- I cried when I read this.

734
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:43,935
Good girl.

735
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:47,295
When you are ready.

736
01:10:50,402 --> 01:10:55,250
As I approach the day I see
or don’t see a version of myself -

737
01:10:55,444 --> 01:10:59,291
the longing within me takes on an
almost physical form.

738
01:10:59,406 --> 01:11:03,764
Morning sickness due to infertility
and deficiency.

739
01:11:03,928 --> 01:11:10,768
When
I see a young mother, I feel joy and despair.

740
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:18,013
I don’t know why women have such a
deep need to create life -

741
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:23,147
why they long for
the comfort of their own flesh and blood.

742
01:11:23,295 --> 01:11:25,810
But I know they miss.

743
01:11:25,976 --> 01:11:30,505
Feeling that many women
with children -

744
01:11:30,658 --> 01:11:33,241
never experience.

745
01:11:33,379 --> 01:11:36,019
Woman's deep grief -

746
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:42,041
and the fear that
children will never get a life.

747
01:11:47,704 --> 01:11:52,109
Well done. You’ve really
reached the right mood.

748
01:11:57,468 --> 01:12:02,327
We need to talk.
Sam wants his hands back.

749
01:12:02,469 --> 01:12:08,229
It's mine.
- Is not. We bought it.

750
01:12:08,392 --> 01:12:12,636
I haven't written the final
scene. - Someone's writing.

751
01:12:12,793 --> 01:12:15,410
I'll kill you.
This is my life.

752
01:12:15,554 --> 01:12:21,883
Is the wife a problem?
- Take it easy.

753
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,962
Sam. Listen.

754
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:36,813
You have written something wonderful
that needs to be shown to people.

755
01:12:36,962 --> 01:12:41,856
It’s your art and
you have to suffer for it.

756
01:12:42,004 --> 01:12:44,519
That's just the way it is.

757
01:12:45,206 --> 01:12:50,053
You don't realize. It's worse.
- Lucy understands. You are a writer.

758
01:12:50,207 --> 01:12:53,303
I'm not!

759
01:12:53,449 --> 01:12:56,931
I am a plagiarist and a thief.

760
01:12:57,090 --> 01:13:00,265
I am the worst villain of what is.

761
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:08,018
That woman's voice. I didn't invent
it, I stole it.

762
01:13:08,174 --> 01:13:11,611
How did you "steal"?
- It's Lucyn.

763
01:13:11,776 --> 01:13:14,541
Lucyko wrote it?

764
01:13:14,697 --> 01:13:18,179
Kind of.

765
01:13:18,338 --> 01:13:21,024
I read his diary.

766
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:25,026
It was on display. I could not
resist the temptation.

767
01:13:25,181 --> 01:13:28,231
That's even worse.
You have to tell him.

768
01:13:28,382 --> 01:13:33,105
It will not work now. Because of the treatment,
her hormones are mixed up.

769
01:13:33,264 --> 01:13:36,314
He is hypersensitive.

770
01:13:36,985 --> 01:13:42,107
I'll tell him soon. When I know
how the story ends.

771
01:13:43,507 --> 01:13:49,324
Well. I hope your
fitness is good, the journey is long.

772
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:53,669
Now we have arrived.
Please visit here.

773
01:13:53,831 --> 01:13:58,406
Just jump on it, spawn
off and pull this to your neck.

774
01:13:58,553 --> 01:14:02,912
Back a little sincere, but the
doctor needs to get access.

775
01:14:03,075 --> 01:14:07,593
Now we need
your input, Sammy.

776
01:14:07,757 --> 01:14:13,083
Deposit here like this.
I say when the checkout is free.

777
01:14:13,239 --> 01:14:16,641
I'll see you soon.

778
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:23,051
An uplifting little garment.
Suitable for premiere.

779
01:14:23,202 --> 01:14:27,174
What premiere?
What do you mean?

780
01:14:27,324 --> 01:14:32,184
For any premiere.
Take it easy. It was a joke.

781
01:14:32,326 --> 01:14:38,494
Now to the men's room. Seize
Partner, fist mambo begins.

782
01:14:48,252 --> 01:14:53,385
I will not make this happen.
- Let's try something.

783
01:14:53,534 --> 01:14:58,735
I know you don’t like Carl,
but this is an important scene.

784
01:14:58,896 --> 01:15:01,661
Tell me
how you see it in your mind.

785
01:15:04,258 --> 01:15:07,865
Ewan?
- Not now.

786
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:15,461
This is an important moment for Colin.

787
01:15:15,622 --> 01:15:18,035
A lot is at stake.

788
01:15:18,183 --> 01:15:24,192
His wife, who
he really loves a lot -

789
01:15:24,345 --> 01:15:29,159
has gone through six weeks of
humiliating treatment.

790
01:15:29,627 --> 01:15:33,269
The ovaries weigh swollen
and make it sore.

791
01:15:33,429 --> 01:15:39,597
He has traveled through London
to queue with others -

792
01:15:39,751 --> 01:15:43,723
that his most private
part is being invaded.

793
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:48,561
Because she desperately
wants to have a baby.

794
01:15:48,714 --> 01:15:50,478
Yeah yeah.

795
01:15:50,635 --> 01:15:57,271
If her husband
does not ejaculate successfully -

796
01:15:57,438 --> 01:16:00,283
all his troubles
have been in vain.

797
01:16:00,439 --> 01:16:04,331
These pressures on his shoulders -

798
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,690
Colin has to sit
alone in the room -

799
01:16:07,842 --> 01:16:13,658
and to do his duty
to his beloved wife.

800
01:16:13,804 --> 01:16:15,420
Alright.

801
01:16:15,925 --> 01:16:19,373
Of course we can't
show him handjob -

802
01:16:19,526 --> 01:16:25,057
so you have to express
everything without words.

803
01:16:26,089 --> 01:16:29,605
Just like that. Brilliant.
Keep that look.

804
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:31,534
Action.

805
01:16:32,731 --> 01:16:36,543
The white dot on the screen
is the needle.

806
01:16:36,693 --> 01:16:42,065
I place it next to the follicle.
Now it's bursting.

807
01:16:42,215 --> 01:16:46,937
We remove the fluid
that becomes the egg.

808
01:16:47,096 --> 01:16:49,861
Like so.

809
01:16:55,980 --> 01:17:00,897
Few can see the image itself
as three cells in size.

810
01:17:01,062 --> 01:17:03,668
Maybe these don't get either.

811
01:17:03,823 --> 01:17:09,832
Let’s give Dick and Debbie
positive energy.

812
01:17:09,985 --> 01:17:15,357
Dick and Debbie?
- That's what I call them.

813
01:17:15,507 --> 01:17:20,276
Is that a good idea? - They are
fertilized embryos.

814
01:17:20,429 --> 01:17:26,415
This is already a big step for us.
We have made a lot of progress.

815
01:17:26,551 --> 01:17:29,350
But the chance
is one in five.

816
01:17:29,512 --> 01:17:34,201
I know, but the 2O percent
chance isn’t bad.

817
01:17:34,354 --> 01:17:38,964
Just think. They were alive
when these pictures were taken.

818
01:17:39,116 --> 01:17:43,008
The two lives
we have created.

819
01:17:43,157 --> 01:17:47,687
They just have to
last a few more days.

820
01:17:47,839 --> 01:17:50,479
They just have to persevere.

821
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:53,815
Share it, Dick and Debbie.

822
01:17:56,162 --> 01:17:59,338
Share it, Dick and Debbie.

823
01:17:59,484 --> 01:18:03,012
Well, girls, let
's practice now.

824
01:18:03,165 --> 01:18:06,852
Training!

825
01:18:09,687 --> 01:18:15,401
Well. The back is pricked
and the vaginal needle is in place.

826
01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:18,972
Hopefully, they will realize what
I have done for them.

827
01:18:19,131 --> 01:18:24,765
One day you may tell.
- The chance is one in five.

828
01:18:24,933 --> 01:18:29,372
Your child would be
one in a million.

829
01:18:29,535 --> 01:18:34,941
When it's all over and
this gets a happy ending -

830
01:18:35,097 --> 01:18:40,548
I want to talk with you.

831
01:18:40,699 --> 01:18:43,624
I love you, Sam.

832
01:18:57,425 --> 01:19:02,626
Okay, that's great.
- Everything is going to be alright.

833
01:19:15,272 --> 01:19:19,961
Everything will be fine.
It has to.

834
01:19:20,114 --> 01:19:24,394
May I have Sam Bell.
I'm his wife.

835
01:19:25,316 --> 01:19:29,755
This is important.
Where is he?

836
01:19:52,366 --> 01:19:55,814
Let's start with the picture from
behind Rachel.

837
01:19:55,967 --> 01:19:59,223
Try to highlight
his vulnerability.

838
01:20:05,371 --> 01:20:08,466
Let's describe it now.

839
01:20:40,864 --> 01:20:42,583
No jaa...

840
01:20:46,066 --> 01:20:51,188
An uplifting little garment.
Suitable for premiere. Sorry.

841
01:20:51,348 --> 01:20:54,945
No, that was good.

842
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:58,883
Next -

843
01:20:59,031 --> 01:21:04,357
comes a really touching moment.

844
01:21:04,513 --> 01:21:08,611
A half-crazy, emotionally
disturbed woman -

845
01:21:08,755 --> 01:21:12,032
jokes even though
his heart breaks.

846
01:21:12,196 --> 01:21:17,693
A close-up of this is taken.
Listen, Nimnh -

847
01:21:17,838 --> 01:21:24,644
this scene culminates
his drift into madness.

848
01:21:24,801 --> 01:21:27,930
Trust Sam's script.

849
01:21:28,082 --> 01:21:33,772
A doomed attempt to remain a
mentally healthy woman.

850
01:21:33,924 --> 01:21:37,771
Beatrix Potter
and Winnie the Pooh fantasies.

851
01:21:37,926 --> 01:21:40,339
Sometimes he prays.

852
01:21:40,487 --> 01:21:46,815
She is considering having
sex on the character’s penis.

853
01:21:46,969 --> 01:21:52,603
Her sex life is a
series of clinical performances.

854
01:21:52,771 --> 01:21:58,200
Sam, you shit too!
Heartless pig!

855
01:21:59,334 --> 01:22:04,022
I have a menstrual period. We
failed. They are gone.

856
01:22:04,176 --> 01:22:09,069
Of course, don’t be embarrassed,
however , he will tell you soon.

857
01:22:09,217 --> 01:22:14,384
What is happening here?
- Ask him. He tells.

858
01:22:14,539 --> 01:22:18,591
You have used everything!
- Sorry -

859
01:22:18,741 --> 01:22:22,200
but we should film.
- Lucy?

860
01:22:22,342 --> 01:22:29,148
Don't come near me. You read
my diary. You stole my thoughts.

861
01:22:30,385 --> 01:22:35,507
You don't have to
read this in a diary:

862
01:22:35,667 --> 01:22:40,709
I hate you!
More than I can imagine!

863
01:22:40,869 --> 01:22:44,682
I don’t want to meet you and I
will never talk to you again.

864
01:22:46,952 --> 01:22:49,307
Lucy...

865
01:22:51,913 --> 01:22:58,640
I hope you looked closely.
That is the intensity we are seeking.

866
01:23:01,917 --> 01:23:07,039
Listen, Lucy.
You overreact to failure.

867
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:10,226
I was going to tell.
Let me explain.

868
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:15,192
I really hate you.
- Don't do this.

869
01:23:15,362 --> 01:23:20,768
You read my diary.
I wanted to have your children.

870
01:23:20,924 --> 01:23:23,530
I do not want anymore!

871
01:23:23,685 --> 01:23:28,044
Good thing Dick
and Debbie died.

872
01:23:53,937 --> 01:24:00,105
I didn’t see Sam for a long time,
I didn’t even apply for a divorce.

873
01:24:09,222 --> 01:24:14,389
I was a little crazy. I
even had a relationship with Carl Phipps.

874
01:24:14,544 --> 01:24:18,152
It could have changed my life.

875
01:24:43,235 --> 01:24:46,330
Are you nervous?
- A little.

876
01:24:47,117 --> 01:24:52,216
You rarely get a premiere
that you have written yourself.

877
01:24:52,839 --> 01:24:56,833
Sam is noble
when you share it with me.

878
01:24:57,321 --> 01:25:03,125
You are gorgeous. Catherine Walker’s
haute couture is so wonderful.

879
01:25:05,164 --> 01:25:09,659
What you said on the phone ...

880
01:25:09,805 --> 01:25:15,439
I'm not going to oblige you
to do anything if it turns out ...

881
01:25:15,607 --> 01:25:21,128
Lucy dear, don't think about it.
I will do my duty.

882
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:27,648
I am damn excited.
It's just a surprise.

883
01:25:28,292 --> 01:25:31,501
You said you couldn't ...

884
01:25:31,653 --> 01:25:35,807
That's what I thought, but
now it looks like -

885
01:25:35,975 --> 01:25:38,206
maybe I can.

886
01:25:38,376 --> 01:25:44,829
And it's wonderful. It's ...
It's really great.

887
01:25:46,299 --> 01:25:48,791
Come lets go.

888
01:25:56,303 --> 01:25:58,191
Shall we?

889
01:26:01,465 --> 01:26:06,461
You've been dreaming
since this little boy.

890
01:26:23,873 --> 01:26:29,324
Good thing you came.
I would have been pathetic with William .

891
01:26:29,475 --> 01:26:32,752
I don't mind Melinda, do you?
- No, we'll meet him there.

892
01:26:32,916 --> 01:26:37,446
I read your new script.
It's good.

893
01:26:37,598 --> 01:26:44,177
All too. Do you miss him
so much? Stupid question.

894
01:26:44,321 --> 01:26:47,371
This is going to be a fun evening.

895
01:26:47,522 --> 01:26:53,895
The nude seizures were wonderful.
We Celts are passionate.

896
01:26:54,044 --> 01:26:58,961
I hated every second.
- That's a hit movie!

897
01:26:59,126 --> 01:27:03,485
Of course, my people have talked to the
Bond people -

898
01:27:03,648 --> 01:27:10,067
but I want to jump bungee
jumps with a Peruvian tribe.

899
01:27:10,210 --> 01:27:16,937
Don't get me wrong. The movie was
good. I deserved worse.

900
01:27:17,093 --> 01:27:20,063
God, those
Englishmen are strenuous!

901
01:28:06,592 --> 01:28:10,711
You look dazzling.
- You look like Rasputin.

902
01:28:16,355 --> 01:28:19,758
Great movie, Sam.

903
01:28:21,757 --> 01:28:26,196
You wrote the best pieces.
- Don't go crazy.

904
01:28:26,359 --> 01:28:33,131
I identified four replicas. It
's your movie. You would be proud.

905
01:28:35,843 --> 01:28:38,972
It wasn't worth it.

906
01:28:40,925 --> 01:28:47,560
I learn a lot. I wish you
had told me about your feelings.

907
01:28:50,568 --> 01:28:56,076
It would be nice to meet and chat.
William misses you.

908
01:28:57,531 --> 01:29:02,141
I do not know. Maybe someday.

909
01:29:29,743 --> 01:29:33,464
All right, William. At the ready?

910
01:29:33,624 --> 01:29:35,547
Now!

911
01:29:37,546 --> 01:29:41,267
We already agreed on this. Ulise.

912
01:29:42,548 --> 01:29:45,950
Ulise, pöhkö koira. Ulysses!

913
01:29:46,109 --> 01:29:48,465
Come on, Sam.

914
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:52,547
Lucy!

915
01:29:52,712 --> 01:29:56,388
Please listen.

916
01:30:00,474 --> 01:30:03,957
Love is not love

917
01:30:04,116 --> 01:30:08,292
Which always changes shape

918
01:30:08,437 --> 01:30:13,012
No, it's a fixed star

919
01:30:13,159 --> 01:30:16,642
Which never slips

920
01:30:16,801 --> 01:30:22,127
Every walker is guided

921
01:30:27,605 --> 01:30:33,136
I am in the park tomorrow.
And every day.

922
01:30:38,969 --> 01:30:43,122
Thanks a lot.
You were great.

923
01:31:28,548 --> 01:31:33,521
You look wonderful, like a dream.
- Do not say that.

924
01:31:33,669 --> 01:31:37,744
No worries. I know.

925
01:31:37,911 --> 01:31:42,691
Sheila said.
You are expecting a baby.

926
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:46,474
He shouldn't have told.
It is at an early stage.

927
01:31:46,634 --> 01:31:52,245
I haven't seen a doctor.
I'm going today.

928
01:31:52,396 --> 01:31:55,629
That is great news.

929
01:31:55,798 --> 01:32:00,236
You deserve it more
than any woman I know.

930
01:32:00,399 --> 01:32:06,261
Of course I would like to list
Phipps. I am jealous.

931
01:32:06,402 --> 01:32:11,774
Carl doesn't want a baby.
He doesn't even want a relationship.

932
01:32:11,924 --> 01:32:15,088
And I don't want to be with him.

933
01:32:15,245 --> 01:32:20,014
I am happy,
but I did not want it this way.

934
01:32:21,207 --> 01:32:24,815
Too bad we don't ...

935
01:32:26,409 --> 01:32:29,744
Anyway, goodbye, Sam.

936
01:32:29,891 --> 01:32:31,859
Hi then, William.

937
01:32:39,574 --> 01:32:43,444
Come back, Lucy.

938
01:32:44,176 --> 01:32:46,099
Please.

939
01:32:46,257 --> 01:32:52,141
I made a stupid mistake,
and I've regretted it ever since.

940
01:32:53,059 --> 01:32:58,749
Please come back.
- We can't just keep going.

941
01:32:58,901 --> 01:33:02,714
Especially if I'm expecting
another man's baby.

942
01:33:05,464 --> 01:33:10,187
I will grow it.
I'll take care of it.

943
01:33:10,346 --> 01:33:16,765
I am the father of it.
- You don't even want your own children.

944
01:33:16,908 --> 01:33:19,810
You live for writing.

945
01:33:19,949 --> 01:33:24,945
Isn't that supposed to change?
I said I was going to father it.

946
01:33:28,713 --> 01:33:32,764
If I have to
suffer a lifetime -

947
01:33:32,914 --> 01:33:35,668
can't i suffer with you

948
01:33:37,276 --> 01:33:41,658
Is that a replica of your hand?
- No.

949
01:33:41,798 --> 01:33:47,158
Or in fact it is.

950
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:50,734
But I still mean it.

951
01:33:51,801 --> 01:33:54,805
Please.

952
01:34:08,448 --> 01:34:11,703
You have to shave that beard.

953
01:34:44,941 --> 01:34:49,300
Should not have been excited about the
result of the home test.

954
01:34:49,463 --> 01:34:53,343
After all,
it says it could be wrong.

955
01:34:53,505 --> 01:34:56,737
But the doctor said
you could be pregnant.

956
01:34:56,906 --> 01:35:02,073
Possibly for a while.
But not anymore.

957
01:35:02,228 --> 01:35:06,529
What do we do now?

958
01:35:06,669 --> 01:35:12,918
We've only tried it once.
There is nothing wrong with us.

959
01:35:13,072 --> 01:35:18,603
So I suggest that -

960
01:35:18,754 --> 01:35:21,610
we love each other -

961
01:35:21,755 --> 01:35:26,365
completely and unreservedly for the
rest of our lives -

962
01:35:26,517 --> 01:35:29,999
beautiful day by day.

963
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:38,890
And they tried ...

964
01:35:41,322 --> 01:35:43,359
And tried ...

965
01:36:12,054 --> 01:36:13,773
And tried.

966
01:36:13,935 --> 01:36:20,388
Where is that fertility symbol
? - On a hill in Dorset.

967
01:36:20,537 --> 01:36:24,862
Do I drive a highway
or follow power lines?

968
01:36:29,461 --> 01:36:33,382
Maybe yet?

969
01:36:36,088 --> 01:36:40,583
