[music playing]

2
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:28,933
NARRATOR: Strained...
The monstrous assurance

3
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:33,867
of this race of puny bipeds with
overblown egos, the creature

4
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,567
who calls himself man.

5
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,933
He believes he owns the Earth
and every living thing on it

6
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:43,133
exists only for his benefit.

7
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:45,967
Yet how foolish he is.

8
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:50,433
Consider, even the lowly
insect that man trods underfoot

9
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:54,067
outweighs humanity several
times and outnumbers

10
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,400
by countless billions.

11
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:59,767
In the continuing war
for survival between man

12
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,800
and the hexapods,
only an utter fool

13
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:06,367
would bet against the insect.

14
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,533
Let a man or woman
venture from the well

15
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:11,167
beaten path of civilization.

16
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,700
Let him cross the threshold
of the limited intellect,

17
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:18,333
and he encounters
amazing, wondrous things...

18
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:21,533
The unknown and terrible.

19
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:24,900
If he escapes these weird
adventures with his life,

20
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:29,433
he will usually find he
left his reason behind him.

21
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:33,500
Perhaps that is what happened
to these two souls, lost

22
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:35,933
in the great Mexican desert.

23
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:41,367
But then ask yourself, why would
anyone trod from the usually

24
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,967
well traveled roads
of this modern age,

25
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:49,467
from the luxury of an air
conditioned automobile?

26
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,633
It's difficult for our modern
world of statistics and

27
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:56,100
electronics to accept miracles.

28
00:02:56,133 --> 00:03:01,933
But you could almost call this
a miracle... a genuine miracle.

29
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:06,567
Out of hundreds and thousands of
square miles of heat and seared

30
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,733
wasteland, where the vultures
wait for the other vultures

31
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:15,433
to die, an American
oil surveyor has chosen

32
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:21,233
to explore this particular
terrible corner of the earth,

33
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:28,200
the Muerto Desert...
The Desert of Death.

34
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:31,133
This surveyor can
hardly credit his eyes.

35
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:35,067
Perhaps they're only
illusive images produced

36
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:38,167
by roasting the optic nerves.

37
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,233
But if they do
exist... If they are

38
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:48,700
living things from somewhere...
One fact is certain.

39
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:54,767
Miracle or not, they will not
be living things for long.

40
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,633
The Muerto Desert,
true to its name,

41
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:02,333
will soon convert
them into dead things.

42
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:23,067
[man panting]

43
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:31,433
Maybe he's coming
out of it, then.

44
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:33,067
I've got it, Doc.

45
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:34,833
Even if they got across
that desert alive,

46
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:36,433
the sun's bound to have
cooked their brains.

47
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:39,067
It's a miracle to me old
Pepe and Frank found them.

48
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,600
Now I'd be getting
back to work.

49
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:44,967
Beats me how they got there
or what they were doing.

50
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:47,367
That's the most
god-forsaken spot on earth.

51
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,367
Maybe they're from that
missing plane we read about.

52
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,100
That plane was headed
for Mexico City.

53
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:55,067
It'd have to be 100 degrees off
to land in the Muerto Desert.

54
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:57,533
100 degrees or not, they
had to come from somewhere.

55
00:04:57,567 --> 00:04:59,233
Where did you say you
picked them up, Pepe?

56
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:02,267
On the road to Zarpa
Mesa, Senor Medico.

57
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,167
[woman moans]

58
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:12,067
DOC: Pretty girl under
all that sunburn.

59
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:14,167
She was almost
completely dehydrated.

60
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,933
I don't know what
kept them alive.

61
00:05:16,967 --> 00:05:17,733
You're all right.

62
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:18,600
You're safe.

63
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:21,667
You're in an oil company office.

64
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,767
You sure?

65
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,133
She's in about the
same shape you are.

66
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:27,767
She hasn't come out of it
yet, but I think you're

67
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,167
both going to be all right.

68
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,967
Here, try to take this.

69
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:38,600
[coughing]

70
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:43,833
Who did you think you
were anyway, Superman?

71
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:45,067
Super...

72
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,933
Nobody's ever been able
to walk across that desert

73
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:47,933
and come out alive.

74
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:49,700
And you try it with a girl.

75
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:52,133
You said this was
an oil company.

76
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,467
Can you load a truck
with full drums

77
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,167
and bring all the
men you can spare?

78
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,867
If we get there in
time, maybe we can...

79
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,867
Can what?

80
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,367
Burn them out
before they scatter.

81
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,300
That's the only thing
that scares them... fire.

82
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,433
But if we're too late, we're...

83
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:04,067
Now just a minute, young fella.

84
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:05,567
Take it easy.

85
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,933
You've been out in
the sun too long.

86
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,700
That sedative will quiet
him down in a minute.

87
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:09,633
I tell you, you don't know.

88
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:10,500
You haven't seen them.

89
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:11,567
But if you had, you'd realize...

90
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,500
Seen them?

91
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:16,067
Look, you said Superman.

92
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:19,867
Well these are super monsters
or bugs as big as we are.

93
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,633
They can... the can... they
can kill you with one bite.

94
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:23,733
DAN: What can?

95
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:26,533
MAN: These... these...
These things.

96
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:31,167
I... if they scatter before
we get there, we're...

97
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,400
Where do they come from?

98
00:06:33,433 --> 00:06:39,133
He's got a... an underground
lab up on Zarpa Mesa.

99
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:40,800
He does something
to their glands.

100
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,167
Who does?

101
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,800
Doctor Aranya.

102
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,233
Aranya?

103
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:49,067
Ay, caramba!

104
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:50,933
I told you the sun had
cooked their brains.

105
00:06:50,967 --> 00:06:52,733
Pepe doesn't think so.

106
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:55,700
And besides, nobody's ever
been able to climb Zarpa Mesa.

107
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:57,233
But you can reach it by plane.

108
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:58,767
Let's listen to
his story anyway.

109
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,633
What do we got to lose?

110
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:05,933
It all started on the
border a few days back.

111
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:10,867
I pilot for Jan van
Croft, the big financier.

112
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,900
Well, we had engine
trouble, and I...

113
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,800
I made a forced landing
in the... the field

114
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:18,433
outside this little
Mexican town.

115
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:23,067
After we landed, I stayed
with the... with the ship to...

116
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,633
NARRATOR: Quite a sorry he's
telling, isn't it, Pepe?

117
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:29,100
You heard from your
people about Zarpa Mesa,

118
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:32,667
and the mysterious
Doctor Aranya, even

119
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,067
though your bosses haven't.

120
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,967
So why tell them?

121
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:42,400
They would only laugh at
you and say, poor Pepe,

122
00:07:42,433 --> 00:07:44,467
you're getting old.

123
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,933
But you heard for years about
the grotesque and misshapen

124
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:55,067
people, about the women...
Strange women who do not die.

125
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,500
No, Grant Philip doesn't
know the whole story.

126
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:03,767
You see, he came into it late.

127
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,633
It actually began, oh, almost a
year ago, the night Dr. Leland

128
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:13,167
Masterson, the world famous
specialist and researcher,

129
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,233
found himself in the
middle of the Muerto

130
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:18,500
Desert, the Desert of Death.

131
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:22,933
He came in answer to a rather
mysterious summons from a man

132
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:25,700
he admired but
knew only as a name

133
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:29,567
signed to a series of brilliant
scientific treatises... Aranya.

134
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:34,700
Well, we've arrived.

135
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:49,100
NARRATOR: Your eyes must
be playing tricks on you

136
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:50,700
in this light.

137
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,367
Is that what you
think, Masterson?

138
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,667
What was it you thought you saw?

139
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,333
Apparently, they've
come correctly.

140
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:12,333
But, uh, to Masterson
it seems strange... a man

141
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:16,167
with the genius of Aranya
building his laboratory

142
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,867
on an inaccessible
mountain top in the middle

143
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,433
of an uninhabited desert.

144
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:24,100
Why Zarpa Mesa?

145
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:26,700
Why Zarpa Mesa, indeed!

146
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,367
A natural question, doctor.

147
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,100
And one that was soon to be
answered, though in a way so

148
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:36,867
fantastic and horrible as
to make a man of science

149
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,600
doubt his senses.

150
00:10:58,433 --> 00:11:00,067
How do you do?

151
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,267
My name is Masterson...
Dr. Leland Masterson.

152
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,433
I believe Dr. Aranya
is expecting me.

153
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,700
Nervous systems of insects.

154
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,967
Dr. Masterson?

155
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:13,667
Dr. Aranya?

156
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,233
I trust your
journey was pleasant.

157
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:25,433
Well, moderately.

158
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:26,867
I must confess,
though, that I was

159
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,833
a trifle uneasy when your driver
headed into the Muerto Desert.

160
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:33,600
But everything seems
to have worked out.

161
00:12:33,633 --> 00:12:37,633
The sentimental human
mind being what it is,

162
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,300
this is the only
sort of a place I

163
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,733
could find to carry on my work.

164
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:44,267
But I can understand
your feelings.

165
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,667
These papers on the anterior
lobe of the pituitary

166
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,300
and the effects of the specific
hormones on other living

167
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,700
things... quite the most
remarkable endocrine

168
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,533
theories that I've ever read.

169
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,533
Well thank you, doctor...
Coming from the world's

170
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:03,067
foremost organo-therapist,
a fine complement.

171
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:04,700
That's why I
jumped at the chance

172
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:08,100
to come here, work with
you, examine your theories.

173
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:11,333
Oh, let us understand
one thing, Doctor.

174
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:14,667
These are not theories.

175
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,300
Not theories?

176
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:22,067
I have successfully proved
every point over and over again

177
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,633
in my laboratory.

178
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:25,067
MASTERSON: Wait a minute.

179
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:28,700
You want me to believe that
you have produce these things

180
00:13:28,733 --> 00:13:30,300
by experimentation?

181
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,500
And many more.

182
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:34,200
Then my eyes weren't
playing tricks.

183
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:36,333
So you can see why
such work as this

184
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:39,667
must be completed
inside a mountaintop

185
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,833
amidst this desolation.

186
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:46,900
Oh, I'm completing a
most unusual experiment

187
00:13:46,933 --> 00:13:48,100
in my laboratory, Doctor.

188
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:51,400
Would you care to observe?

189
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:52,800
Oh, certainly!

190
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,167
Then come along.

191
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:03,133
[machinery humming]

192
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:24,433
Only a matter of minutes now.

193
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:27,367
What is the na...
Nature of this... this...

194
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,800
Well, I require some
clarification, Doctor.

195
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:34,300
As you know, I have isolated the
growth hormone of the anterior

196
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:37,067
pituitary, the
specific substance

197
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,700
which controls the growth
pattern of human beings.

198
00:14:41,733 --> 00:14:43,767
Yes, it was the subject
of one of your papers.

199
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,167
Yes, and with
this accomplished,

200
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,933
I said to myself what would
the effect be of this hormone,

201
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:56,233
or a complete human pituitary
being transferred in the body

202
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:58,133
of another creature?

203
00:14:58,167 --> 00:15:01,800
I began a series
of experiments...

204
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,367
Moderate success among
the lesser animals,

205
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,267
a complete failure among birds.

206
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:13,067
And then, experimenting
one day upon the hexapods,

207
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:15,667
I came upon the
Theraphosidae family.

208
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,300
MASTERSON: A tarantula?

209
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,500
Exactly.

210
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:21,333
The tarantulas began to
yield amazing results.

211
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:24,633
They grew as large
as human beings,

212
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:27,300
began developing new
reasoning powers.

213
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:33,333
And I found I had the telepathic
power to communicate with them.

214
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:36,867
And then I reversed the
process, transplanted

215
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,767
the controlled
substance of the insect

216
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,067
back into the human body.

217
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,067
Doctor, observe this girl.

218
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:58,433
I call her Tarantella.

219
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:00,900
She has human beauty
and intelligence,

220
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:03,800
but still possesses the
capacities and instincts

221
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,733
of the giant spider.

222
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,700
How do you mean?

223
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,733
She has the indestructibility
of the insect.

224
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:12,867
If her body became
damaged, if she

225
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,533
were to lose an arm or a leg,
she could grow a new one.

226
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:19,567
I expect Tarantella may
survive for hundreds

227
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,400
and hundreds of years.

228
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:23,867
And what about males?

229
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,500
Well unfortunately,
in the insect world,

230
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:30,767
the male is a puny,
unimportant thing.

231
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,767
You saw a few of the examples.

232
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,733
The dwarfs.

233
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:37,067
I think we're beginning
to get some results.

234
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:42,067
What is it?

235
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:47,567
If we are successful, I shall
have a super female spider

236
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,100
with a thinking and
reasoning brain,

237
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:54,067
a creature that
someday may control

238
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,767
the world subject to my will.

239
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,267
Are you convinced now, Doctor?

240
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,800
I hope you appreciate this
opportunity I'm giving you

241
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,067
to become a colleague of mine.

242
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,300
No... no!

243
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,633
You can't do these things!

244
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,667
You're tampering with
the work of the Creator!

245
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,600
Gibberish.

246
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:42,167
You're evil!

247
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,500
This place is like...
You must be destroyed,

248
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:48,833
you and all the foul
things that you've made!

249
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,200
Your choice, Doctor.

250
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:52,467
A very poor choice.

251
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,067
Of course you know I cannot
let you leave this place.

252
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:57,233
Someway, somehow I'll find
a way to put an end to you

253
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:59,333
and your ghastly experiments!

254
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:00,800
[sinister music]

255
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,567
Regrettable.

256
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,933
I was hoping for a colleague,
but... well at least we have

257
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:20,367
another experimental subject.

258
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:09,600
Mr. Masterson, here's
your orange juice.

259
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:10,333
Mr. Masterson!

260
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:19,767
[music playing]

261
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,300
[music stops]

262
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,733
[applause]

263
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:02,200
Thank you, sir.

264
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:03,067
Thank you very much.

265
00:21:09,867 --> 00:21:11,233
[music playing]

266
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:18,700
What a dump.

267
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:20,867
Well, it isn't exactly
the Star Club, I'll admit.

268
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,600
But...

269
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:28,333
Senora, Senor... the
best people in the house.

270
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,533
Something to drink...
Anything tall and cool.

271
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:57,467
Si, senor.

272
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:04,433
We had to come down in this
flea-bitten border town.

273
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:09,433
And you would drag me to this
dive... this upholstered sewer.

274
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:12,067
Oh, I find this
place rather amusing.

275
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:15,467
Your great southwest has
a certain, uh, flare, no?

276
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,633
No.

277
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:18,300
I don't happen to be in
the mood for a cook's

278
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,467
tour of our great southwest.

279
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,167
If it wasn't for
that forced landing,

280
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,667
we'd be in Mexico
getting married by now.

281
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,633
But my dear, you can't blame
me for the motor trouble.

282
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:29,800
Those things will happen
to the best of planes.

283
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:32,167
Well it didn't have to
happen on my wedding day.

284
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,900
Now you're acting childish,
and that's not you.

285
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:38,567
After all, being able to
adapt oneself to any situation

286
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,700
is the mark of the
true sophisticate.

287
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:41,900
I'm sorry.

288
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:43,267
And you're not angry with me?

289
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
Of course not, darling.

290
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,767
William J Masterson
is the name.

291
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,667
May I?

292
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,067
I beg your pardon?

293
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:11,667
May I say you are
beautiful, my dear?

294
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,133
Very beautiful and good.

295
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,567
That's very kind of you.

296
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,067
Yes, Wu?

297
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,433
The plane is ready, huh?

298
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:26,567
Not for some time.

299
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,533
The pilot is having
considerable trouble.

300
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:31,767
Spend a small
fortune for a plane,

301
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,367
hire the best pilot I can
get, and what happens?

302
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:38,133
Well, Wu?

303
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,500
What are you waiting for?

304
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:40,900
Get back to the plane.

305
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:41,633
Yes, master.

306
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,600
[guitar]

307

[music playing]

308
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:16,700
Masterson, it's
certainly good to see you.

309
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,533
I've been looking
for you for two days.

310
00:26:20,567 --> 00:26:25,233
I'm sorry, but I felt
like a little trip.

311
00:26:25,267 --> 00:26:27,433
We missed you, sir.

312
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:29,633
Dr. Harrison wishes
to see you, you know?

313
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:31,100
[awkward chuckle]

314
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:34,533
I know, George.

315
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:38,967
But I don't want to see him.

316
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:40,933
I don't get this.

317
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:42,933
Who are you, and
what's this all about?

318
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:44,800
I'm his nurse, miss.

319
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:45,700
His nurse?

320
00:26:45,733 --> 00:26:46,533
Yes.

321
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:48,067
You see, Mr. Masterson is...

322
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:49,867
MASTERSON: No, George.

323
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,767
I wouldn't do that.

324
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,933
See, I like this lady.

325
00:27:58,067 --> 00:28:01,100
You like her?

326
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:02,533
Very much.

327
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:07,567
She's fascinating... as
a dancer, of course.

328
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,467
I don't like her.

329
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:22,533
That woman is evil.

330
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,533
Tell me... tell me what's wrong.

331
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:25,533
Not now, Anne.

332
00:28:25,567 --> 00:28:26,267
Don't talk.

333
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:48,167
And they threw
her down, and blood

334
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,667
was sprinkled on the wall.

335
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,600
And he trod her underfoot.

336
00:29:07,233 --> 00:29:08,633
[gun shot]

337
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:14,633
Give me that gun,
Mr. Masterson.

338
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:16,667
Please, give me that gun!

339
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,467
Come on, let's get out of here.

340
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,367
Stop, everybody!

341
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,667
Listen, this man's
an insane killer.

342
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,900
He's loco.

343
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:26,933
He'll kill all of us
before you can reach him.

344
00:29:26,967 --> 00:29:28,567
Thank you, George.

345
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,300
Well spoken.

346
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,400
I only did what had to be done.

347
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:46,867
George...

348
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,733
Don't take another step.

349
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:54,167
This lady is my friend,
and nobody shall hurt her.

350
00:29:56,867 --> 00:29:58,467
I will kill her first.

351

[sound stops]

353
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,700
George... let's go home.

354
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,667
Don't be afraid.

355
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,367
I won't let them hurt you.

356
00:30:57,767 --> 00:31:01,367
Oh, you brought
the cars, George.

357
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,167
Excellent.

358
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,133
You'll sit with me.

359
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:09,100
But Mr. Masterson,
she's not going with us.

360
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:11,667
Not going with us?

361
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,400
You must, my dear.

362
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:15,100
You're in danger.

363
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:17,300
But we've got to get
to the landing field.

364
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,900
Landing field?

365
00:31:19,933 --> 00:31:22,800
Very well, I shall
take you there.

366
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,533
Let me talk to the Sheriff.

367
00:31:24,567 --> 00:31:28,067
Doreen dear, you
sit up here in front.

368
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,700
Miss Doreen is going to
sit with me, aren't you?

369
00:31:32,733 --> 00:31:33,533
Yes.

370
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:34,367
Yes, of course.

371
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:44,333
[car starts]

372
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,467
There's a dead woman lying
right here on the floor.

373
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,700
That's right, Sheriff.

374
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:57,867
He shot her dead.

375
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,867
No, she's right where she fell.

376
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,300
Nobody touched a thing.

377
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:03,067
We...

378
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:04,433
[music playing]

379
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,500
Sheriff, the body just got
up and walked out of here.

380
00:32:30,767 --> 00:32:32,067
Here we are, my dear.

381
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:33,167
At last.

382
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,167
And Philip seems to
ready for the take-off.

383
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,967
All set to go, Philips?

384
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:40,633
Sorry sir, but one of the
engine's still acting up.

385
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,200
Whatever it is, I
can't find the butt.

386
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:44,100
It's probably nothing serious.

387
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:45,933
Can't we take off anyway?

388
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:48,567
No sir, I can't
take that chance.

389
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,633
You're the captain.

390
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:50,767
How much longer do you think...

391
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,400
My dear young man.

392
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:54,533
I want to fly.

393
00:32:54,567 --> 00:32:56,433
You... you want to...

394
00:32:56,467 --> 00:32:59,467
I've always wanted to fly.

395
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,800
And now I will.

396
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:03,333
Sorry, sir.

397
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:05,967
But I'm the one who decides
whether we fly or not.

398
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:10,700
I command, and thou shalt obey.

399
00:33:10,733 --> 00:33:12,333
Is he kidding?

400
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,867
He ain't kidding, mister.

401
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,067
You'd better do as he says.

402
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:21,700
We fly... now.

403
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,700
You'll go first.

404
00:33:24,733 --> 00:33:25,800
[sirens]

405
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,433
Listen, the police!

406
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:29,400
At last!

407
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:31,433
Don't be afraid.

408
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,867
I won't let them harm you.

409
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,067
Get in, quick.

410
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:45,533
Come along, George.

411
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:47,100
Now we will all fly.

412
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:27,100
Well, she's on course.

413
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:29,067
How long do you think
it will take us, Philips?

414
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,600
If everything goes all right,
about an hour and a half.

415
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:38,567
It's wonderful up here
so close to heaven.

416
00:34:43,867 --> 00:34:45,400
Wait a minute,
there's something

417
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:46,267
wrong with this gyrocompass.

418
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,733
Somebody's fooled
with the setting.

419
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:52,267
We've been flying 100
degrees off course.

420
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:03,233
I knew it.

421
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,167
The left engine's
acting up already.

422
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,500
Is it bad, Jan?

423
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:11,067
Do we have to go down again?

424
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,467
How should I know?

425
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,600
Just stay calm, please.

426
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:14,967
Nothing seriously wrong so far.

427
00:35:27,133 --> 00:35:32,300
It's getting worse... much
worse' I'll have to go down,

428
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:33,233
and fast.

429
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:46,067
I can't see a place to land.

430
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,267
It don't look too good, Miss.

431
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,433
We keep on flying.

432
00:35:51,467 --> 00:35:53,333
I like it.

433
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:55,367
This is my order.

434
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,600
Fasten your safety belts.

435
00:35:57,633 --> 00:36:00,333
This can't last much longer.

436
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,767
And please, remain calm.

437
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,833
Can't you find the
landing spoke, Philips?

438
00:36:05,867 --> 00:36:09,833
Not yet, but I am trying
for that Mesa dead ahead.

439
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,467
You think we'll make it?

440
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,667
I don't know, sir.

441
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,067
Keep your fingers crossed.

442
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:17,900
Miss Culbertson, no smoking!

443
00:36:17,933 --> 00:36:19,367
OK, captain.

444
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,233
But may I ask where we are?

445
00:36:21,267 --> 00:36:24,600
Somewhere over Mexico
at an altitude of 1,500,

446
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:25,933
and with a dying engine.

447
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:30,633
The other one's OK.

448
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:34,200
It doesn't do us any
good, not in this ship.

449
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:39,500
Birds fly without
motors, and so will we.

450
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:42,267
Mister, I don't know
who you or what you are,

451
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,300
but this bird won't fly.

452
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,600
When a bird is
sick, he has to land.

453
00:36:46,633 --> 00:36:48,900
And our bird is
sick... very sick.

454
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,133
The sick I shall heal.

455
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:58,067
The good I shall protect.

456
00:36:58,067 --> 00:37:00,333
We've got a chance.

457
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:01,600
I'm going down.

458
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:03,067
Well hold tight!

459
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:04,467
It's going to be rough.

460
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:09,067
Hold on, everybody!

461
00:37:09,067 --> 00:37:10,300
It looks too short.

462
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:11,467
I'll have to break the run.

463
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:26,800
Is everything all right?

464
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:27,600
Yes.

465
00:37:27,633 --> 00:37:28,600
Yes, I'm all right.

466
00:37:28,633 --> 00:37:29,333
Good.

467
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:47,467
Stick close, I
want to talk to you.

468
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,200
Right.

469
00:37:54,633 --> 00:37:56,233
I never thought we'd
make it, Philips.

470
00:37:56,267 --> 00:37:57,333
But we did, sir.

471
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,300
Good girl, Miss Culbertson.

472
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:04,433
Oh, thank you, captain.

473
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,700
I like it here.

474
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,667
Our voices sound
strange up here.

475
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,567
Do you hear that?

476
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,767
It must be the echo of
our voices, my dear, thrown

477
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,267
back at us from the forest.

478
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,900
Two days ago he
got away from us.

479
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:46,067
I been hunting him ever since.

480
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,800
I caught up with him
in that border dive

481
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:50,300
just before he
killed that dancer.

482
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,067
I tried, but I
couldn't stop him.

483
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,767
Why did he kill her?

484
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,600
How did he get that gun?

485
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,100
Nobody knows why he kills.

486
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:59,700
He just wants to, and he does.

487
00:38:59,733 --> 00:39:01,233
How he got that gun?

488
00:39:01,267 --> 00:39:02,633
Probably bought it.

489
00:39:02,667 --> 00:39:04,833
He has lots of
money all the time.

490
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:07,500
Doesn't mean a thing to him.

491
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:09,333
Can't we get that
gun away from him?

492
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:10,967
I'll try, captain.

493
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:12,833
You can bet on that.

494
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:16,567
But for the sake of all of us,
don't try to rush or force him.

495
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,333
Leave it to me.

496
00:39:17,367 --> 00:39:18,867
All right.

497
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,133
May I smoke now, captain?

498
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:22,167
No, not yet.

499
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,767
I have to look at
a gas tanks first.

500
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:39,133
Now, Miss Culbertson,
you may smoke.

501
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:40,500
Thank you, captain.

502
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:42,400
Any idea where we are, Philips?

503
00:39:42,433 --> 00:39:43,133
I think so, sir.

504
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:53,867
We're in Mexico about 120
miles below the border

505
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,300
on top of a mesa rising
600 feet above the desert.

506
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,733
600 feet!

507
00:39:58,767 --> 00:40:03,667
That's right... stuck
up in the air like a...

508
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,033
Like an island in the sky.

509
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:08,033
I suppose we can't
walk down from here.

510
00:40:08,067 --> 00:40:09,700
Not unless you're a human fly.

511
00:40:09,733 --> 00:40:11,400
DOREEN: I'm sorry, captain.

512
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:13,533
Haven't been with
the circus for years.

513
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:14,367
It's wonderful!

514
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:19,433
So close to heaven.

515
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,133
I'd better get that
flare and the flash light.

516
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:36,867
We'll need some light.

517
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:45,733
Something moves in there.

518
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:49,300
I don't like it here a bit.

519
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:52,600
Well, if they had a
nightmare, this is it.

520
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:54,000
Who could be out there?

521
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:56,233
I don't know, Culbertson.

522
00:40:56,267 --> 00:40:58,067
Well it could be a
very natural cause...

523
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,633
An old dead branch breaking
off, or a falling tree.

524
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,333
I wouldn't worry too much.

525
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:03,100
Well here comes Wu.

526
00:41:03,133 --> 00:41:05,067
Now we will have a fire.

527
00:41:05,067 --> 00:41:06,733
Did you hear that
noise out there, Wu?

528
00:41:06,767 --> 00:41:07,600
Yes, master.

529
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:08,400
You heard?

530
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:09,567
Did you see anything?

531
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,067
The curtain of darkness
veils the sharpest eyes.

532
00:41:13,067 --> 00:41:15,700
Wu saw nothing.

533
00:41:15,733 --> 00:41:17,367
Well let's get that fire going.

534
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,200
I'll be back in a minute.

535
00:41:39,533 --> 00:41:41,067
Well, that's better!

536
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:43,133
We have a fire, flare and...

537
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,167
A drink... oh, I
certainly can use it.

538
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,933
That's what occurred to
me when I saw the bottle.

539
00:41:47,967 --> 00:41:53,333
But first, let's get
this into the air.

540
00:41:53,367 --> 00:41:54,733
[loud whistle]

541
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:00,967
Our only flare, and it worked.

542
00:42:01,067 --> 00:42:02,400
How do we know it was seen?

543
00:42:02,433 --> 00:42:03,400
Well we don't, sir.

544
00:42:03,433 --> 00:42:05,900
All we can do is hope.

545
00:42:05,933 --> 00:42:08,467
Sorry, Miss
Culbertson... no glass.

546
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,933
Oh that's all right, Wu.

547
00:42:09,967 --> 00:42:11,900
It's a relief to be
informal once in a while.

548
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:20,533
I think I'll eat something.

549
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:21,867
I feel hungry.

550
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,333
Shut up, you fool!

551
00:42:23,367 --> 00:42:25,700
You are the fool, Jan!

552
00:42:25,733 --> 00:42:26,433
Remember his gun?

553
00:42:29,933 --> 00:42:32,567
A hungry animal knows no fear.

554
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,800
No, thank you... not
brandy just before dinner.

555
00:42:41,833 --> 00:42:43,400
Sorry, sir, to disillusion you.

556
00:42:43,433 --> 00:42:46,067
But there's no food on this
ship, not even a K-ration.

557
00:42:56,167 --> 00:42:56,933
Thank you, sir.

558
00:42:56,967 --> 00:42:59,833
That helped.

559
00:42:59,867 --> 00:43:01,133
I'm going to look around.

560
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:02,067
What for?

561
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,300
You can't see anything.

562
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:05,433
We need this flash lighter.

563
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:06,567
I have this.

564
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,900
Does that give
out enough light?

565
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:12,333
Sure, I use it at the
sanitarium all the time.

566
00:43:12,367 --> 00:43:14,633
It's passed my
dinnertime, dear.

567
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:16,067
Aren't you hungry?

568
00:43:16,067 --> 00:43:19,800
But Mr. Masterson, we
have no food with us.

569
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:21,633
George will bring it.

570
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:22,833
He always does.

571
00:43:41,067 --> 00:43:42,733
If our fire wasn't
seen by anyone,

572
00:43:42,767 --> 00:43:45,100
how will be get off this mesa?

573
00:43:45,133 --> 00:43:47,400
To be honest,
sir, I don't know.

574
00:43:47,433 --> 00:43:49,067
We can't do anything
decisive until daylight.

575
00:43:51,367 --> 00:43:53,233
[music playing]

576
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,567
Thank you, captain.

577
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,067
You're so attentive.

578
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,800
But even I can do some
things for myself.

579
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:13,667
So I noticed.

580
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,600
And, uh, no offense meant.

581
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:19,467
You scare easily,
don't you, captain?

582
00:45:31,367 --> 00:45:32,300
[scream]

583
00:45:32,333 --> 00:45:34,267
It's George!

584
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,733
He needs help.

585
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:37,200
I'll go see what happened.
Wu's right.

586
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:38,233
He does need help.

587
00:45:38,267 --> 00:45:39,700
I'm going with you, Grant.

588
00:45:39,733 --> 00:45:41,667
Anything's better than to
have to sit here and wait.

589
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,733
May I suggest that we
wait here until Philips

590
00:45:43,767 --> 00:45:44,867
find out what happened.

591
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,200
You'll be safer here.

592
00:45:46,233 --> 00:45:47,633
Are you concerned
about my safety?

593
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:49,133
George is out there
and in trouble.

594
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:50,267
I'll go.

595
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,100
Anyone who wants to come
along can do so now.

596
00:45:52,133 --> 00:45:54,967
I'd like a stroll
before dinner.

597
00:45:55,067 --> 00:45:57,100
Since you insist, we all go.

598
00:45:57,133 --> 00:45:57,933
You come too.

599
00:45:57,967 --> 00:45:59,233
Yes, master.

600
00:45:59,267 --> 00:46:01,067
I'll have to put some
more wood on the fire.

601
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:16,367
Let's stay close together.

602
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,667
The, uh, best way is to
hold each other's hand

603
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,833
and form a line.

604
00:46:21,867 --> 00:46:23,700
If you don't mind...

605
00:46:23,733 --> 00:46:25,933
I believe it's better,
Mr. van Croft, if you hold

606
00:46:25,967 --> 00:46:27,700
onto Mr. Masterson's coat.

607
00:46:27,733 --> 00:46:28,833
And Wu, you bring up the rear.

608
00:47:06,967 --> 00:47:09,067
DOREEN: Can you see anything?

609
00:47:09,067 --> 00:47:09,900
I can't.

610
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,600
[rustling]

611
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:41,300
Is that you, George?

612
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:26,767
The is the end of the trail.

613
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,300
Can you see
anything down there?

614
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:30,500
Only a black, gaping hole.

615
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:37,633
Light won't reach bottom.

616
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,100
Well you wait here.

617
00:48:43,133 --> 00:48:43,900
I'll try this alone.

618
00:48:43,933 --> 00:48:45,200
It looks too narrow.

619
00:48:45,233 --> 00:48:47,233
One wrong step, and
we may all go over.

620
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:11,167
Is it George?

621
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:11,900
Yeah.

622
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,700
Who could have shot him?

623
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:46,700
Nobody shot him.

624
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:47,433
Look.

625
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,767
Those aren't bullet wounds?

626
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,267
How horrible!

627
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,133
What could have killed him?

628
00:49:57,167 --> 00:49:59,600
I don't know.

629
00:49:59,633 --> 00:50:01,533
I hope we won't
have to find out.

630
00:50:04,633 --> 00:50:06,733
George is beyond help.

631
00:50:06,767 --> 00:50:11,633
We should all go back and
tend the fire for the living.

632
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:14,167
Poor George.

633
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,067
Well there's not a
thing we can do for him.

634
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:18,267
Now stand close
to the underbrush.

635
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,033
I'll have to get by.

636
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,133
I can't see a thing.

637
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:03,367
That noise is not
falling branches.

638
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,600
Something's moving in there!

639
00:51:23,633 --> 00:51:25,100
Help, it's got me!

640
00:51:25,133 --> 00:51:26,100
Something got me!

641
00:51:26,133 --> 00:51:26,967
Where?

642
00:51:27,067 --> 00:51:31,433
Here on my arm... my left arm.

643
00:51:31,467 --> 00:51:33,867
That's a nasty scratch, all
right, but nothing serious.

644
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,667
I'll dress it as soon as
we get back to the plane.

645
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,700
I'd suggest we all stay
away from these thorns.

646
00:51:52,367 --> 00:51:55,067
Oh look, this skirt's ruined.

647
00:51:55,067 --> 00:51:57,933
And so is this heel.

648
00:51:57,967 --> 00:52:00,300
But you weren't
hurt, Miss Culbertson.

649
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:02,733
No, not a bit.

650
00:52:02,767 --> 00:52:03,533
Thank you.

651
00:52:06,433 --> 00:52:09,067
May we go on now, Philips?

652
00:52:09,067 --> 00:52:10,600
Uh, yes sir.

653
00:52:10,633 --> 00:52:11,333
Let's go.

654
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:44,467
Where's that bottle
of yours, captain?

655
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,533
I sure could use another drink.

656
00:52:46,567 --> 00:52:48,200
I think we all could
stand a little drink

657
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:48,967
after this experience.

658
00:53:09,267 --> 00:53:10,167
How about you?

659
00:53:24,533 --> 00:53:26,300
There must be something
we can do to get help.

660
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:27,733
We've done the
only thing we can

661
00:53:27,767 --> 00:53:30,500
do... that's send up a flare.

662
00:53:30,533 --> 00:53:34,500
If help doesn't come by morning,
we'll make a signal fire.

663
00:53:34,533 --> 00:53:38,667
But meanwhile, I'd
suggest we get some sleep.

664
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,700
We got a long night ahead of us.

665
00:53:40,733 --> 00:53:42,600
Do you expect any of
us to sleep after...

666
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:44,867
After what happened tonight?

667
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:49,067
Well, I... maybe not sleep, but
at least you'll get some rest.

668
00:53:49,067 --> 00:53:50,633
But we are all in danger.

669
00:53:50,667 --> 00:53:52,400
Whatever killed
George may attack us.

670
00:53:52,433 --> 00:53:53,767
Take it easy, sir.

671
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:59,667
I'll stand guard and keep the
fire going... my eyes open.

672
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:03,667
Well, we all could
use a little rest.

673
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:07,100
But remember now, we are
putting our lives in your hands.

674
00:54:07,133 --> 00:54:10,300
I realize that, sir.

675
00:54:10,333 --> 00:54:14,067
Doreen, dear, why
don't you try to make

676
00:54:14,067 --> 00:54:17,533
yourself a little comfortable?

677
00:54:17,567 --> 00:54:19,400
Try to get some rest.

678
00:54:19,433 --> 00:54:22,067
I'll try.

679
00:54:22,067 --> 00:54:25,067
The doctor said it was
a good night to melt

680
00:54:25,067 --> 00:54:27,567
away with the morning sun.

681
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,300
Mr. Masterson, don't you think
you better get some sleep?

682
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:34,600
Is it bedtime?

683
00:54:34,633 --> 00:54:35,567
Yeah.

684
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,433
Yeah, it's bedtime.

685
00:54:41,067 --> 00:54:42,733
I'll awake you
when morning comes.

686
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:09,200
[rustling]

687
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:21,433
Very good, my dear... very good.

688
00:55:21,467 --> 00:55:22,967
Soon their nerves will break.

689
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,933
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to wake you.

690
00:56:00,967 --> 00:56:02,800
I wasn't asleep.

691
00:56:02,833 --> 00:56:04,667
Are you nervous?

692
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,100
No.

693
00:56:07,133 --> 00:56:07,933
I was just thinking.

694
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:14,333
Philips, why do you ignore me?

695
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,700
That what you were
thinking about?

696
00:56:19,733 --> 00:56:22,067
Yes.

697
00:56:22,067 --> 00:56:23,600
And I resent it.

698
00:56:23,633 --> 00:56:26,933
You're not used to it, huh?

699
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,700
Do you really
dislike me that much?

700
00:56:28,733 --> 00:56:30,900
I don't dislike
you, Miss Culbertson.

701
00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:33,133
But you don't approve
of me, is that it?

702
00:56:33,167 --> 00:56:36,900
You think I'm marrying
him for his money.

703
00:56:36,933 --> 00:56:39,800
Well, aren't you?

704
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:41,933
I'm very fond of him.

705
00:56:41,967 --> 00:56:43,467
But you don't love him.

706
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:48,767
Well I'm not exactly mad about
him, if that's what you mean.

707
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,267
But I am fond of him.

708
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:53,067
And he can give
you nice things.

709
00:56:53,067 --> 00:56:54,767
Well, yes.

710
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,500
Why not?

711
00:56:58,233 --> 00:57:01,833
He can give me
security, for one thing.

712
00:57:01,867 --> 00:57:03,067
And that's important.

713
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,967
Don't you think?

714
00:57:07,067 --> 00:57:09,967
Why should you
care what I think?

715
00:57:10,067 --> 00:57:11,733
I don't exactly.

716
00:57:11,767 --> 00:57:16,400
It's just that I'd like
you to understand me.

717
00:57:23,933 --> 00:57:26,333
What is it?

718
00:57:26,367 --> 00:57:27,767
I thought I heard something.

719
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:33,233
No, I guess it wasn't anything.

720
00:57:38,433 --> 00:57:43,767
Now, uh, what were you saying?

721
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:47,733
I was saying that I'd
like you to understand me.

722
00:57:47,767 --> 00:57:49,567
I think I do understand you.

723
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,533
Oh, no you don't.

724
00:57:51,567 --> 00:57:52,433
You can't.

725
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:00,167
Oh yes I can.

726
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,633
I've had my hard knocks, too.

727
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:05,867
I've had to work ever
since I was a kid.

728
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:09,767
Some of it wasn't very much fun.

729
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,100
Well, I guess it boils down
to what you want out of life.

730
00:58:13,133 --> 00:58:16,233
What is it for you, Grant?

731
00:58:16,267 --> 00:58:26,900
Well, I want a girl who's
sincere, real... someone who...

732
00:58:26,933 --> 00:58:28,967
Who'd stick by me
when the chips are

733
00:58:29,067 --> 00:58:33,067
down... one who wants
me only for what I am,

734
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,967
and not for what I have.

735
00:58:39,367 --> 00:58:40,133
It's a big order, huh?

736
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:58,200
Wait a minute!

737
00:59:01,367 --> 00:59:07,700
This was to be your
wedding night, remember?

738
00:59:07,733 --> 00:59:10,067
Yes.

739
00:59:10,067 --> 00:59:10,733
Yes, of course.

740
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:18,333
That was a foolish thing to do.

741
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,500
Grant look!

742
00:59:38,633 --> 00:59:40,233
Take it easy,
Mrs. Culverson.

743
00:59:40,267 --> 00:59:42,167
Your imagination
is getting the best of you.

744
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,400
This was no imagination.

745
00:59:43,433 --> 00:59:45,300
It was there, I saw it!

746
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:48,367
What did you see, dear?

747
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,067
Well, I couldn't sleep.

748
00:59:51,067 --> 00:59:56,367
Philips and I were sitting here
talking, and there was a noise.

749
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,700
I looked up, and I... I saw
some women and a little man.

750
01:00:01,733 --> 01:00:05,833
He seemed unreal.

751
01:00:05,867 --> 01:00:07,533
No offense intended,
Miss Culbertson,

752
01:00:07,567 --> 01:00:10,667
but I know what strange tricks
our minds can play on us.

753
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:11,600
Yes I know, Philips.

754
01:00:11,633 --> 01:00:14,200
But I'm sure I saw it.

755
01:00:14,233 --> 01:00:16,900
Where's your comb, my dear?

756
01:00:16,933 --> 01:00:18,667
Comb?

757
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:21,667
Oh, I guess I lost it
out there somewhere.

758
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,533
But I gave it to you.

759
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:24,967
We must find it.

760
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,533
That comb is a valuable
heirloom of my family.

761
01:00:28,567 --> 01:00:29,900
What do you mean by we?

762
01:00:29,933 --> 01:00:33,567
If you think I'm going out
there once more, you're crazy.

763
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,167
I didn't intend you to go.

764
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,800
Wu will go and look for it.

765
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:38,867
May I have the light?

766
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:41,000
Oh, don't be a fool!

767
01:00:41,033 --> 01:00:44,767
He who serves well will
also serve in danger.

768
01:00:52,133 --> 01:00:52,833
Wu?

769
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,967
The wanderer in the
valley of darkness

770
01:01:04,067 --> 01:01:07,667
shall have my guidance
and protection.

771
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,167
OK, Wu.

772
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,333
If you feel that way
about, I won't stop you.

773
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:13,767
But don't hesitate
to use that gun.

774
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:14,900
I hope you know how.

775
01:01:14,933 --> 01:01:18,867
There is a day to be
born and a day to die.

776
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:08,267
I want you to realize that
if Wu doesn't come back

777
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,833
you will be responsible.

778
01:02:10,867 --> 01:02:15,200
I'll never touch that comb
again even if he finds it.

779
01:02:15,233 --> 01:02:18,667
I still have my heirloom.

780
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:20,400
You make me sick!

781
01:02:20,433 --> 01:02:22,133
And you are a coward, sir.

782
01:02:22,167 --> 01:02:23,400
What?

783
01:02:23,433 --> 01:02:24,900
Why you...

784
01:02:24,933 --> 01:02:27,067
You're very brave, aren't
you, since Masterson

785
01:02:27,067 --> 01:02:28,267
no longer has a gun?

786
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,200
Let go of me if you don't
want to lose your job.

787
01:02:30,233 --> 01:02:32,367
I haven't had the
opportunity to tell you yet,

788
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,300
but I quit when Wu went
out there on your orders.

789
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:59,900
Have you brought Masterson?

790
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,300
Yes, he's here.

791
01:03:01,333 --> 01:03:04,467
Good, we've found him at last.

792
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,933
What about the others?

793
01:03:05,967 --> 01:03:09,133
Well I have something in mind
for the girl and the pilot.

794
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:11,800
The other I'm going
to dispose of.

795
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,300
What's the matter, Wu?

796
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,833
There's your
priceless heirloom.

797
01:04:24,867 --> 01:04:25,967
Wu is dead?

798
01:04:26,067 --> 01:04:26,700
Yeah.

799
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:31,100
You murdered him!

800
01:04:38,533 --> 01:04:39,300
They're coming for us!

801
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:40,067
They're coming!

802
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,100
Throw more wood on
that fire, quick!

803
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:47,767
Just keep it moving, Doreen.

804
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,800
Well, remember, we
haven't seen them yet.

805
01:04:49,833 --> 01:04:51,467
Aren't you afraid, Grant?

806
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,967
I'm scared stiff.

807
01:04:53,067 --> 01:04:56,733
If you're frightened,
what do you call him?

808
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:58,100
I can't stand it.

809
01:04:58,133 --> 01:05:00,733
I'm getting out of here.

810
01:05:00,767 --> 01:05:01,900
GRANT: Don't be a fool!

811
01:05:01,933 --> 01:05:03,333
The only thing keeping
them back is our fire!

812
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:11,733
Oh, no!

813
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,267
[scream]

814
01:05:25,933 --> 01:05:28,867
Grant, look!

815
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,300
[scream]

816
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,133
He'll recover
consciousness in a moment

817
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:49,467
or so... be perfectly sane again.

818
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:54,433
Unfortunately, he left us
in such a state before.

819
01:05:54,467 --> 01:05:57,433
I understand that he was
committed to an asylum,

820
01:05:57,467 --> 01:06:00,567
and attempted to
kill Tarantella.

821
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,067
Grant, look!

822
01:06:02,067 --> 01:06:04,267
It's the dancer from the cafe.

823
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,633
I saw him kill her.

824
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:08,667
Amazing, the durability
of my creations.

825
01:06:12,867 --> 01:06:14,567
Dr. Aranya!

826
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,267
Aranya... that's
Spanish for spider.

827
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,533
We meet again, doctor.

828
01:06:17,567 --> 01:06:18,333
Again?

829
01:06:18,367 --> 01:06:19,967
Did I leave here?

830
01:06:20,067 --> 01:06:23,767
Yes, I seem to
remember vaguely that...

831
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:26,233
Yes, you escaped
us before, doctor.

832
01:06:26,267 --> 01:06:28,767
And well, you led us a
merry chase recovering you.

833
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,467
Why... why not just kill me?

834
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:32,067
Why bring me back?

835
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,733
Unfortunately, I
still need your help.

836
01:06:34,767 --> 01:06:38,433
If I give you one more
chance to change your mind.

837
01:06:38,467 --> 01:06:39,700
No, never!

838
01:06:39,733 --> 01:06:42,167
Nothing you can do will ever
make me a party to this.

839
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,467
Tarantella...

840
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,333
No, you're not going
to torture him anymore!

841
01:06:56,167 --> 01:06:57,133
Stop it!

842
01:06:57,167 --> 01:06:58,333
Don't, you fool!

843
01:06:58,367 --> 01:06:59,167
Fool?

844
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,633
I don't think so.

845
01:07:00,667 --> 01:07:02,333
In just a few moments, this
will explode and destroy you,

846
01:07:02,367 --> 01:07:03,833
and me, and all of your
terrible creations.

847
01:07:03,867 --> 01:07:05,433
Doctor, you're
a man of science!

848
01:07:05,467 --> 01:07:06,533
You wouldn't
destroy the greatest

849
01:07:06,567 --> 01:07:07,667
achievement of science.

850
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:09,467
Scientist, yes... but
I'm a human being, too.

851
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,167
And that's where we differ.

852
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,600
You two have got a chance.

853
01:07:12,633 --> 01:07:13,967
Through that door and down the
corridor on the right... hurry!

854
01:07:14,067 --> 01:07:15,267
Who is he?
What is this place?

855
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:16,400
He's a brilliant madman.

856
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:17,567
Hurry, there are
only seconds left!

857
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,067
- What about you?
- Don't argue... go!

858
01:07:22,767 --> 01:07:23,533
No, don't!

859
01:07:23,567 --> 01:07:24,667
Take it, Aranya.

860
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,900
Your creations can grow
a new arm or a leg,

861
01:07:26,933 --> 01:07:29,267
but nothing can survive fire.

862
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,633
[explosion]

863
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,067
I don't know how
long we stumbled

864
01:07:43,067 --> 01:07:48,667
and staggered across that
desert before they found us.

865
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:50,533
Well, that's about the story.

866
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,100
Believe it or not.

867
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:54,833
Grant!

868
01:07:57,733 --> 01:07:59,833
How do you feel, honey?

869
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:01,900
All right, I guess.

870
01:08:01,933 --> 01:08:04,267
I've just been
telling them our story.

871
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:08,233
They... they don't buy it.

872
01:08:08,267 --> 01:08:09,633
I think he did.

873
01:08:09,667 --> 01:08:11,367
Es verdad.

874
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:13,500
That's the truth.

875
01:08:13,533 --> 01:08:15,100
Now don't worry about it.

876
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:17,233
You're going to be all
right in a couple of days.

877
01:08:17,267 --> 01:08:19,900
Just a little too much
sun on the bare head.

878
01:08:19,933 --> 01:08:22,733
Anybody thinks I'm going to
load one of my trucks with oil

879
01:08:22,767 --> 01:08:25,633
and send it up on top
of a mountain to burn

880
01:08:25,667 --> 01:08:28,133
a bunch of imaginary spiders...

881
01:08:28,167 --> 01:08:31,300
NARRATOR: Yes,
you're right, Dan.

882
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:34,900
Common sense tells you there
isn't anything to his story,

883
01:08:34,933 --> 01:08:36,333
doesn't it?

884
01:08:36,367 --> 01:08:41,667
Giant spiders on a
desert mesa... fantastic!

885
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:44,533
Pepe is just a
superstitious native.

886
01:08:44,567 --> 01:08:48,433
True, no one has ever
been on Zapa Mesa.

887
01:08:48,467 --> 01:08:51,767
But it's just like any
other bit of table land...

888
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:55,233
Not a thing different about it.

889
01:08:55,267 --> 01:08:58,200
Or, uh, is there?
