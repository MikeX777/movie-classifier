1
00:00:05,204 --> 00:00:09,123
This was never the way I planned

2
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:11,990
Not my intention

3
00:00:12,653 --> 00:00:19,256
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion

4
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:27,039
It's not what, I'm used to
Just wanna try you on

5
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:33,825
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

6
00:00:34,078 --> 00:00:41,412
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick

7
00:00:41,668 --> 00:00:48,784
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

8
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:52,534
It felt so wrong
It felt so right

9
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:56,205
Don't mean I'm in love tonight

10
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:59,785
I kissed a girl and I liked it

11
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,940
I liked it

12
00:01:07,504 --> 00:01:14,566
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter

13
00:01:14,844 --> 00:01:22,048
You're my experimental game
Just human nature

14
00:01:22,307 --> 00:01:26,559
It's not what, good girls do

15
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:33,509
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused

16
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:37,144
Hard to obey

17
00:01:37,322 --> 00:01:44,063
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick

18
00:01:44,256 --> 00:01:51,371
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

19
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:55,578
It felt so wrong
It felt so right

20
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,036
Don't mean I'm in love tonight

21
00:01:59,215 --> 00:02:02,746
I kissed a girl and I liked it

22
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:06,836
I liked it

23
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:10,187
Us girls we are so magical

24
00:02:10,373 --> 00:02:14,096
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable

25
00:02:14,265 --> 00:02:17,594
Hard to resist so touchable

26
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:21,256
Too good to deny it

27
00:02:21,463 --> 00:02:25,078
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

28
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:35,917
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick

29
00:02:36,143 --> 00:02:43,356
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it

30
00:02:43,558 --> 00:02:47,327
It felt so wrong
It felt so right

31
00:02:47,528 --> 00:02:50,870
Don't mean I'm in love tonight

32
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:54,758
I kissed a girl and I liked it

33
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:58,629
I liked it

34
00:02:59,941 --> 00:02:63,629
