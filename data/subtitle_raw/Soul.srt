1
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,406
{\An8}

2
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,494
<i>All right, let's try somethin' else.</i>

3
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:42,877
{\An8}<i>Uh, from the top.
Ready. One, two, three.</i>

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,715
{\An8}

5
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:54,849
One, two, three, four.

6
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:57,478
Stay on the beat.

7
00:00:57,603 --> 00:00:59,563
Two, three, four.

8
00:01:04,276 --> 00:01:05,904
That's C-sharp, horns.

9
00:01:07,406 --> 00:01:09,741
Two, three...
I see you, Caleb.

10
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:12,495
Rachel, now you.

11
00:01:12,912 --> 00:01:14,956
Forgot my sax, Mr G.

12
00:01:15,123 --> 00:01:19,503
Okay, she forgot her sax.
And now, all you, Connie.

13
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,754
Go for it!

14
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:38,441
Way to go!

15
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:45,365
Hang on, hang on.
What are y'all laughing at?

16
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:47,285
So Connie got a little lost in it.

17
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:48,911
That's a good thing.

18
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:50,580
Look, I remember one time

19
00:01:50,663 --> 00:01:52,540
my dad took me to this jazz club,

20
00:01:52,708 --> 00:01:54,251
and that's the last place I wanted to be.

21
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:55,544
But then I see this guy,

22
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:59,298
and he's playing these chords
with fourths on it,

23
00:01:59,466 --> 00:02:00,884
and then with the minor...

24
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:02,469
Oh, oh, whoo.

25
00:02:02,552 --> 00:02:05,263
Then he adds the inner voices,
and it's like he's...

26
00:02:05,346 --> 00:02:06,599
It's like he's singing.

27
00:02:07,516 --> 00:02:10,394
And I swear, the next thing I know...

28
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:13,732
...it's like he floats off the stage.

29
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:16,568
That guy was lost in the music.

30
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:20,030
He was in it, and he took
the rest of us with him.

31
00:02:26,245 --> 00:02:28,082
And I wanted to learn...

32
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,876
...how to talk like that.

33
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:33,295
That's when I knew...

34
00:02:37,217 --> 00:02:38,551
I was born to play.

35
00:02:40,846 --> 00:02:43,140
Connie knows what I mean.
Right, Connie?

36
00:02:43,307 --> 00:02:44,642
I'm 12.

37
00:02:47,603 --> 00:02:49,773
I'll be right back.
Practise your scales.

38
00:02:50,732 --> 00:02:51,817
Sorry to interrupt, Mr Gardner.

39
00:02:52,984 --> 00:02:54,194
You're doing my ears a favour.

40
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:56,697
- Hey!
- Not you, though, you're good.

41
00:02:56,864 --> 00:02:58,032
He's not.

42
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,700
What can I do for you, Principal Arroyo?

43
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:02,663
I wanted to deliver
the good news personally.

44
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,915
No more part-time for you.

45
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:08,043
You're now our full-time band teacher.

46
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:09,295
Job security.

47
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:11,297
Medical insurance. Pension.

48
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:13,675
Wow. That's, uh, great.

49
00:03:13,842 --> 00:03:18,431
Welcome to the M.S. 70 family, Joe.
Permanently.

50
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:20,433
Thanks.

51
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:37,411
After all these years,
my prayers have been answered.

52
00:03:37,578 --> 00:03:39,621
A full-time job.

53
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:41,081
Working man, coming through.

54
00:03:41,165 --> 00:03:42,166
Yeah, Mom, but I...

55
00:03:42,249 --> 00:03:44,085
You're going to tell them yes, right?

56
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:45,336
Don't worry, Mom, I got a plan.

57
00:03:45,503 --> 00:03:46,755
You always got a plan.

58
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:48,757
Maybe you need to have a backup plan, too,

59
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,634
for when your plan falls through.

60
00:03:50,718 --> 00:03:52,178
A backup plan never hurts.

61
00:03:52,261 --> 00:03:54,847
Joey, we didn't struggle
giving you an education

62
00:03:55,014 --> 00:03:56,599
so you could be a middle-aged man

63
00:03:56,683 --> 00:03:58,268
washing your underwear in my shop.

64
00:03:58,435 --> 00:04:00,228
Walking around with a hole in his pants.

65
00:04:00,395 --> 00:04:02,147
- Yeah, but...
- With this job, you'll be able

66
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,317
to put that dead-end gigging behind you.

67
00:04:04,484 --> 00:04:07,111
And Lord knows we need
more teachers in this world.

68
00:04:07,278 --> 00:04:08,279
And just think,

69
00:04:08,446 --> 00:04:12,534
playing music will finally
be your real career.

70
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:15,662
So you're going to tell them yes, right?

71
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,081
Please say yes.

72
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,792
Yeah, definitely.

73
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:19,959
Good.

74
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,801
Hello?

75
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:27,885
How you been, Mr G?

76
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:30,596
Uh, it's Curley. Lamont.
Lamont Baker.

77
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:33,767
Hey, Curley!
Hey, good to hear your voice, man.

78
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,228
Uh... Listen.
You can call me Joe now, Curley.

79
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:37,312
I'm not your teacher anymore.

80
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:38,648
<i>Oh, okay, Mr Gardner.</i>

81
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:41,734
<i>Hey, look, I'm the new drummer
in the Dorothea Williams Quartet,</i>

82
00:04:41,818 --> 00:04:44,821
<i>and we're kickin' off our tour
with a show at The Half Note tonight.</i>

83
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:46,323
Dorothea Williams!
Are you kidding me?

84
00:04:46,406 --> 00:04:48,909
Are you kidding me?
Congratulations, man. Wow!

85
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:51,370
I would die a happy man

86
00:04:51,453 --> 00:04:53,957
if I could perform with Dorothea Williams.

87
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,501
<i>Oh, well,
this could be your lucky day.</i>

88
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,068
- Whew, there he is.
- Hey, Curley.

89
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,238
Leon skipping town
really put us in a bind, man.

90
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,990
- Yeah. Uh, I'll bet.
- I'm glad you made it.

91
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:26,327
My boy, Bishop, said he sat in with you
on a set last year in Brooklyn.

92
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:27,537
Said you were great.

93
00:05:27,704 --> 00:05:29,998
Well, you know,
for a coffee shop.

94
00:05:56,945 --> 00:05:57,946
Hey, Dorothea.

95
00:05:58,947 --> 00:06:00,574
This is the cat I was telling you about.

96
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:03,036
My old middle school band teacher,
Mr Gardner.

97
00:06:03,203 --> 00:06:04,537
Call me Joe, Dorothea.

98
00:06:04,621 --> 00:06:06,581
Uh... Uh, I mean, Miss Williams.

99
00:06:06,748 --> 00:06:09,210
It's a pleasure. Wow.
This is amazing.

100
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:12,838
Uh, Joe is Ray Gardner's son.

101
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,844
So, we're down to
middle school band teachers now.

102
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,643
Get on up here, Teach,
we ain't got all day.

103
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,485
What... What are we playin'?

104
00:08:19,192 --> 00:08:20,401
Uh, sorry.

105
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:22,946
I zoned out a little back there.

106
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:26,867
Joe Gardner, where have you been?

107
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:29,829
I've been, uh, teaching,
middle school band.

108
00:08:29,912 --> 00:08:31,163
Uh, but on the weekends, I...

109
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:32,749
- You got a suit?
- Uh...

110
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,127
Get a suit, Teach.
A good suit.

111
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:37,295
Back here tonight.
First show's at 9:00.

112
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:38,463
Soundcheck's at 7:00.

113
00:08:38,713 --> 00:08:40,216
We'll see how you do.

114
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:45,555
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

115
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:48,725
You see that, Dad?
That's what I'm talking about!

116
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:49,893
Hey, look up, look up.

117
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:52,229
You know what that's gonna say?
Joe Gardner!

118
00:08:53,731 --> 00:08:55,233
You're never gonna believe
what just happened.

119
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:57,652
I did it. I got the gig. Yes!

120
00:08:57,735 --> 00:08:58,736
I... I know.

121
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,531
Dorothea Williams!
Can you believe it?

122
00:09:00,698 --> 00:09:02,366
Hey, pal, you're gonna get hurt!

123
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,119
Just don't tell my mom about this. Okay?

124
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:07,873
Forget class. I'm in a different class.

125
00:09:07,956 --> 00:09:09,875
I'm in a Dorothea Williams class, buddy.

126
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,126
You know what I'm saying? I'm...

127
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:12,586
Whoa! Sorry!

128
00:09:30,523 --> 00:09:31,649
What the...

129
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:40,910
Hello?

130
00:09:43,121 --> 00:09:44,164
Hello?

131
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:57,304
What the...

132
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,229
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hello!

133
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,106
Hello.

134
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,068
Oh, what's your name, honey?

135
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,653
Uh, I'm Joe. Joe Gardner.

136
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,988
Look, I'm not supposed to be here.

137
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:15,992
Ah. Must have been sudden for you.

138
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,204
You see, Joe, I'm 106 years old.

139
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:21,998
Been waiting a long time for this.

140
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,336
- For what?
- The Great Beyond.

141
00:10:27,922 --> 00:10:29,340
The Great Beyond?

142
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:32,344
- As in, as in beyond life?
- Yeah.

143
00:10:32,427 --> 00:10:33,929
That's death right there?

144
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:37,642
Exciting, isn't it?

145
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:39,060
No, no, no, listen.

146
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:40,728
I have a gig tonight.
I can't die now.

147
00:10:40,812 --> 00:10:42,397
Well, I really don't think

148
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,858
you have a lot to say about this.

149
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:45,484
Yes. Yes, I do.

150
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:48,696
I'm not dying the very day
I got my shot. I'm due.

151
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,156
Heck, I'm overdue.

152
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,366
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
I'm outta here.

153
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:54,786
I don't think you're supposed
to go that way.

154
00:10:54,953 --> 00:10:56,538
This can't happen.
I'm not dyin' today.

155
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:58,666
Not when my life just started.

156
00:11:07,551 --> 00:11:08,552
What was that?

157
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:11,139
Wait. I'm not finished.
I gotta get back.

158
00:11:11,306 --> 00:11:12,474
I don't wanna die!

159
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,726
I'm not done.
I'm not done. Run!

160
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:16,728
- Why aren't you running?
- I don't know.

161
00:11:16,811 --> 00:11:18,522
- What's wrong with you people?
- I don't know.

162
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:25,197
I'm not done.

163
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,281
Ahh!

164
00:11:31,453 --> 00:11:34,081
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.

165
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:35,917
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me.

166
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,714
Help! I'm not done.
I gotta get back.

167
00:11:43,884 --> 00:11:45,512
Oh, my... Oh, my goodness.

168
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:08,857
What?

169
00:13:09,232 --> 00:13:10,233
Ow!

170
00:13:13,737 --> 00:13:15,490
Now, now, everyone,

171
00:13:15,573 --> 00:13:17,074
let's give the mentor some room.

172
00:13:17,283 --> 00:13:19,911
Sorry, new souls.
37, that's enough.

173
00:13:20,077 --> 00:13:23,957
Hey, everyone, look here.
Quiet coyote.

174
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,335
Shh. Quiet coyote.

175
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:28,170
Who... Who are you?

176
00:13:28,337 --> 00:13:29,631
I am the coming together

177
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:32,175
of all quantised fields of the universe.

178
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,512
Appearing in a form
your feeble human brain can comprehend.

179
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,223
- What?
- You can call me Jerry.

180
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:39,099
Jerry, okay.

181
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:41,519
Uh, hey, is this heaven?

182
00:13:41,602 --> 00:13:43,396
No.

183
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:47,025
Is it H-E-double hockey sticks?

184
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:50,655
- Hell.
- Hell, hell, hell.

185
00:13:50,738 --> 00:13:52,782
- Shh. Quiet coyote.
- Hell.

186
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,575
It's easy to get turned around.

187
00:13:54,742 --> 00:13:57,037
This isn't the Great Beyond.
It's the Great Before.

188
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,289
The Great Before?

189
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:02,793
Oh. We call it the You Seminar now.
Rebranding.

190
00:14:05,588 --> 00:14:06,589
Hell.

191
00:14:06,673 --> 00:14:07,674
No, no. You're here!

192
00:14:14,223 --> 00:14:15,766
Does this mean I'm dead?

193
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,892
Not yet.

194
00:14:16,977 --> 00:14:18,854
Your body's in a holding pattern.

195
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,021
It's complicated.

196
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:21,606
I'll get you back to your group.

197
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:31,243
Come on, little souls, get on up here.

198
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:36,415
Welcome to the You Seminar.

199
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,461
You are in for a treat.

200
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,644
- Mm, that's weird.
- What is it?

201
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,646
- The count's off.
- Excuse me?

202
00:14:56,813 --> 00:15:01,194
There's a soul missing.
The count's off.

203
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:03,613
Huh.

204
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:07,784
Okay, first stop
is the Excitable Pavilion.

205
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:09,620
You four. In you go.

206
00:15:18,546 --> 00:15:22,301
You five, you'll be aloof.
And you two, why not?

207
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,766
Oh, wait a minute.

208
00:15:27,849 --> 00:15:29,518
This is where personalities come from?

209
00:15:29,684 --> 00:15:32,395
Of course. Do you think people
are just born with them?

210
00:15:37,527 --> 00:15:39,320
So, uh, how do they get to Earth, then?

211
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:41,490
Well, they use the Earth portal.

212
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:49,832
Once they get a complete personality,
of course.

213
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:52,252
Hello? Hello?

214
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:04,516
Goodbye.

215
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:11,816
Whee!

216
00:16:13,484 --> 00:16:14,611
Whoo-hoo!

217
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:18,824
Wait, wait, wait.

218
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,770
You sure get lost a lot.

219
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,106
All righty, mentors.

220
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,650
- Just find your name here...
- Hello, Jerry...

221
00:16:48,734 --> 00:16:49,735
...and join us inside.

222
00:16:49,818 --> 00:16:50,819
...got a lost mentor for you.

223
00:16:50,903 --> 00:16:52,029
Thanks, Jerry.

224
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:54,656
Uh, look, I'm not sure
I'm supposed to be here.

225
00:16:54,823 --> 00:16:55,992
I understand.

226
00:16:56,075 --> 00:16:57,493
Mentoring isn't for everyone.

227
00:16:57,577 --> 00:16:58,912
You're more than welcome to opt out.

228
00:16:59,162 --> 00:17:01,289
Actually, on second thought,

229
00:17:01,372 --> 00:17:04,543
you know, the mentoring sounds like fun.

230
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,921
I'm glad to hear it.
Jerry will take it from here.

231
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:09,716
Thanks, Jerry.
Head right on over there to Jerry.

232
00:17:09,883 --> 00:17:10,884
Thank you, Jerry.

233
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:12,135
Is everyone here named Jerry?

234
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,261
Good luck!

235
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:15,180
Jerry, we've got a problem.

236
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,641
Oh, hello, there, Terry.

237
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:18,351
The count's off.

238
00:17:18,434 --> 00:17:20,269
I seriously doubt that.

239
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:22,021
The count hasn't been off in centuries.

240
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:25,609
151,000 souls go into
the Great Beyond every day.

241
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:28,612
That's 105.2 souls per minute, Jerry.

242
00:17:28,779 --> 00:17:31,074
1.75 souls per second.

243
00:17:31,658 --> 00:17:33,201
And I count every single one of 'em.

244
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:34,369
Yep. I'm aware.

245
00:17:34,452 --> 00:17:37,206
It's my job to keep track
of this stuff, Jerry.

246
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,582
I'm the accountant.

247
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,709
And we all think
you're doing a wonderful job,

248
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,211
- don't we, everyone?
- Absolutely.

249
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:43,295
Looks good from where this guy's standing.

250
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:44,381
I'd say no.

251
00:17:44,548 --> 00:17:47,133
I'm always counting.
I'm counting right now.

252
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,095
You blinked five times
since I started talking. Six.

253
00:17:50,262 --> 00:17:52,265
Right. Since accounting is your job,

254
00:17:52,348 --> 00:17:54,350
why don't you figure out the problem?

255
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:56,352
- Maybe I will.
- Wonderful.

256
00:18:03,277 --> 00:18:04,361
Hello again, Terry.

257
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:05,655
Don't play dumb with me.

258
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,909
Okay, here we go.

259
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:13,581
"A."

260
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,641
<i>Hello, there, mentors.</i>

261
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:33,812
<i>I'm Jerry, a counselor here
at the You Seminar.</i>

262
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:37,107
<i>Now you don't remember it,
but you've been here before.</i>

263
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:40,111
<i>But don't worry,
forgetting the trauma of childbirth</i>

264
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:42,572
<i>is one of the great gifts of the universe.</i>

265
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,616
<i>Here at the You Seminar,</i>

266
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:48,829
<i>all new souls are given unique
and individual personalities.</i>

267
00:18:48,913 --> 00:18:52,333
<i>I'm an agreeable sceptic
who's cautious yet flamboyant.</i>

268
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:56,421
<i>I'm an irritable wallflower
who's dangerously curious.</i>

269
00:18:56,588 --> 00:19:01,344
<i>I'm a manipulative megalomaniac
who's intensely opportunistic.</i>

270
00:19:01,427 --> 00:19:03,763
<i>Oh-ho, this one might be a handful.</i>

271
00:19:03,846 --> 00:19:05,389
<i>But that's Earth's problem.</i>

272
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:08,810
<i>You'll notice these souls
are all missing something.</i>

273
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:10,896
<i>What goes in this spot?</i>

274
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:13,483
<i>Well, these souls need their "spark".</i>

275
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:15,735
<i>And that's where you come in.</i>

276
00:19:15,985 --> 00:19:18,071
<i>Maybe you will find their spark</i>

277
00:19:18,154 --> 00:19:19,822
<i>in the Hall of Everything,</i>

278
00:19:20,031 --> 00:19:24,245
<i>where literally anything
on Earth could inspire.</i>

279
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,415
<i>Or perhaps you'll prefer the Hall of You,</i>

280
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:32,379
<i>featuring a selection of moments
from your own inspiring life.</i>

281
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,048
<i>And just what is this spark?</i>

282
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:48,106
<i>I know you're all excited to get to work,</i>

283
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:50,650
<i>so good luck finding the spark.</i>

284
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:52,652
Find the spark.

285
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:55,281
Wow, that was informative.

286
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:58,701
Now, it's time for my favourite
part of the programme,

287
00:19:58,867 --> 00:20:02,163
matching you mentors with your soul mates.

288
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,125
Our first mentor is Maria Martinez.

289
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:07,544
Maria, come on down.

290
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:09,714
Maria was a rare disease specialist

291
00:20:09,797 --> 00:20:11,716
from the University of Mexico.

292
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:14,886
<i>I'm cured. I'm cured.</i>

293
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:16,847
She'll be matched
with one of my favourites,

294
00:20:17,014 --> 00:20:21,768
soul number 108,210,121,415.

295
00:20:21,852 --> 00:20:24,731
Congratulations! Off you go.

296
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:28,109
Our next mentor is Bjorn T. Börgensson.

297
00:20:31,155 --> 00:20:33,949
Dr Börgensson
is a world-renowned child psychologist

298
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:36,828
who was recently awarded a Nobel Prize.

299
00:20:37,162 --> 00:20:39,956
<i>I see pain, death, destruction.</i>

300
00:20:40,457 --> 00:20:42,792
<i>- How about now?
- A pretty butterfly.</i>

301
00:20:44,003 --> 00:20:48,049
Dr Börgensson will be matched
with soul number 22.

302
00:20:49,508 --> 00:20:51,929
Oh, we're gonna get into this now.
Excuse me.

303
00:20:53,555 --> 00:20:55,933
22, you come out of
this dimension right now.

304
00:20:56,016 --> 00:20:57,393
How many times
do I have to tell you?

305
00:20:57,477 --> 00:20:58,603
I don't wanna go to Earth.

306
00:20:58,686 --> 00:21:00,230
- Stop fighting this, 22.
- I don't wanna.

307
00:21:00,313 --> 00:21:01,356
You will go to Earth

308
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,440
- and have a life.
- Make me!

309
00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:05,444
22 has been at the You Seminar
for quite some time

310
00:21:05,611 --> 00:21:08,072
and has had such
notable mentors as Gandhi,

311
00:21:08,155 --> 00:21:10,199
Abraham Lincoln, and Mother Teresa.

312
00:21:10,282 --> 00:21:11,952
I made her cry.

313
00:21:12,035 --> 00:21:13,203
Ignore that.

314
00:21:13,286 --> 00:21:14,287
Put me down.

315
00:21:14,371 --> 00:21:16,206
We're truly glad to have you here,
Dr Börgensson.

316
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:21,879
It is an honour having you
prepare 22 for Earth.

317
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,173
I'm gonna make you wish you never died.

318
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:26,468
Most people wish that, 22.

319
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,429
Off you go. Bye!

320
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:35,728
Where are we?

321
00:21:36,312 --> 00:21:37,397
That's great progress.

322
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,109
You should be very proud.
Step by step.

323
00:21:40,276 --> 00:21:42,444
In celebration of
Dr Börgensson's body of work,

324
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,446
we are pleased to present him
this honorary...

325
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,116
These past few weeks,
I have seen such growth.

326
00:21:46,199 --> 00:21:47,576
So many people I'd like to thank,
of course.

327
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:49,661
Okay, look,
I'm sure your life was amazing

328
00:21:49,744 --> 00:21:51,121
and you did amazing things,

329
00:21:51,204 --> 00:21:52,248
but here's what we're gonna do.

330
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:53,874
We're gonna stand here
in silence for a little bit,

331
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,585
then we go back out, you say you tried,

332
00:21:55,668 --> 00:21:58,212
I go back to not living my non-life
and you go to the Great Beyond.

333
00:21:58,296 --> 00:21:59,756
- No, look.
- Talk all you want, Bjorn.

334
00:21:59,923 --> 00:22:01,258
It's not gonna work, anyway.

335
00:22:01,425 --> 00:22:03,677
I've had thousands of mentors
who failed and now hate me.

336
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:04,845
Mother Teresa...

337
00:22:05,012 --> 00:22:07,932
I have compassion for every soul.

338
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:09,601
Except you. I don't like you.

339
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:10,768
Copernicus...

340
00:22:10,852 --> 00:22:13,272
The world doesn't revolve around you, 22.

341
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:14,440
Muhammad Ali...

342
00:22:14,523 --> 00:22:16,942
You are the greatest pain in the butt.

343
00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:18,152
Marie Antoinette...

344
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:20,196
Nobody can help you! Nobody!

345
00:22:20,363 --> 00:22:21,448
Thanks, but no thanks, Doc.

346
00:22:21,615 --> 00:22:23,366
I already know everything about Earth,

347
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,534
and it's not worth the trouble.

348
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:26,662
Come on, don't you want
to fill out your pass?

349
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:28,789
You know, I'm comfortable up here.

350
00:22:28,873 --> 00:22:29,957
I have my routine.

351
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:31,918
I float in mist, I do my Sudoku puzzles,

352
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:33,169
and then, like, once a week,

353
00:22:33,253 --> 00:22:34,963
they make me come
to one of these You Seminars.

354
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,465
It's not great, but I know what to expect.

355
00:22:36,632 --> 00:22:38,967
Look, kid, I'm not...
Can I just be honest with you?

356
00:22:39,134 --> 00:22:41,220
I'm not Bjorn Borgenstein

357
00:22:41,304 --> 00:22:42,847
or whatever his name is.
I'm not even a mentor.

358
00:22:43,014 --> 00:22:44,432
Not a mentor?

359
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:47,686
Ah...

360
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,480
Reverse psychology.

361
00:22:49,563 --> 00:22:52,232
You really are a good shrink, Doctor.

362
00:22:52,316 --> 00:22:53,651
Carl Jung already tried that.

363
00:22:53,817 --> 00:22:56,488
Stop talking!
My unconscious mind hates you!

364
00:22:56,571 --> 00:22:58,240
Is there any way

365
00:22:58,323 --> 00:22:59,908
to show a different life in this place?

366
00:23:10,837 --> 00:23:14,842
Wait. You're really not Bjorn Börgensson?

367
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,428
It's my life.

368
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:19,764
Um, excuse me, what's going on here?

369
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:22,184
Binaca breath spray?
Cheap cologne?

370
00:23:23,852 --> 00:23:25,896
Man, who curated this exhibit?

371
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,398
You did.

372
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:29,901
<i>♪ I go to Harlem, it's no problems</i>

373
00:23:29,985 --> 00:23:32,487
Oh, my goodness.
It's Cedric's rap group. No!

374
00:23:32,654 --> 00:23:34,698
<i>♪ Now everybody bow down
To the Kings of Queens ♪</i>

375
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:37,451
No, don't look at that stuff.
Let's look over here.

376
00:23:38,327 --> 00:23:40,037
Dad, I don't wanna go.

377
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:41,330
I don't like jazz.

378
00:23:41,414 --> 00:23:43,292
Black improvisational music.

379
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:45,711
It's one of our great contributions
to American culture.

380
00:23:45,794 --> 00:23:47,713
At least give it a chance, Joey.

381
00:23:51,134 --> 00:23:52,343
This is where it all started.

382
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:55,513
This is the moment where
I fell in love with jazz.

383
00:23:57,099 --> 00:23:58,142
Listen to that.

384
00:23:58,225 --> 00:24:00,644
See, the tune is just an excuse
to bring out the you.

385
00:24:00,811 --> 00:24:03,815
And that's why I became a jazz musician.

386
00:24:05,734 --> 00:24:07,319
It's not what we're looking for.

387
00:24:07,485 --> 00:24:10,197
Wait a minute, that's not how
I remember it going down.

388
00:24:10,364 --> 00:24:12,450
Come back when you have something.

389
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,910
- Sorry, Joe.
- Sorry, Joe.

390
00:24:15,077 --> 00:24:16,454
We're looking
for something different.

391
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,457
Two, three, four.

392
00:24:38,605 --> 00:24:41,107
My life was meaningless.

393
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:51,328
No, no, no.

394
00:24:51,495 --> 00:24:52,663
No, I will not accept this.

395
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:55,958
Kid, give me that badge.
I'm goin' back to my body.

396
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,503
Oh, yeah, sure. Here.

397
00:25:07,638 --> 00:25:10,307
Unless it becomes an Earth Pass,
I'm stuck with it.

398
00:25:12,435 --> 00:25:15,146
Well, what if I help you
turn it into an Earth Pass?

399
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:16,314
Will you give it to me then?

400
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:19,318
Wait...

401
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:23,322
I've never thought of that.
I'd get to skip life.

402
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:24,949
So, yes!

403
00:25:25,534 --> 00:25:27,286
But we gotta get
this thing to change first,

404
00:25:27,452 --> 00:25:29,329
and I've never been able
to get it to change.

405
00:25:29,621 --> 00:25:31,540
Come on.
I know all about sparks.

406
00:25:31,707 --> 00:25:33,501
Because mine is piano.

407
00:25:44,597 --> 00:25:47,684
- Really? Nothin' at all?
- Eh.

408
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:52,022
Oh, no, not jazz, just music.
I don't like music sounds.

409
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:53,983
It feels like a little too much.

410
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:57,403
Well, I'm not going out like this.

411
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,240
Where's that, uh, Hall of Everything?

412
00:26:02,993 --> 00:26:04,494
I'll be right back.

413
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:05,787
Don't get ahead of yourself, pal.

414
00:26:05,954 --> 00:26:08,124
By the way, why do you sound
like a middle-aged white lady?

415
00:26:08,207 --> 00:26:09,208
I don't.

416
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:10,418
- This is all an illusion.
- Huh?

417
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:11,878
This whole place is a hypothetical.

418
00:26:12,045 --> 00:26:14,089
I could sound
like this if I wanted to.

419
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:15,716
Or sound like this instead.

420
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:17,051
I could even sound like you.

421
00:26:17,134 --> 00:26:18,344
Life is so unfair.

422
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:21,765
I don't wanna die.
Somebody call the wambulance. Wah!

423
00:26:22,515 --> 00:26:24,684
I just use this voice
because it annoys people.

424
00:26:24,768 --> 00:26:25,936
It's very effective.

425
00:26:30,358 --> 00:26:32,360
Don't worry, they're fine.

426
00:26:33,986 --> 00:26:35,489
You can't crush a soul here.

427
00:26:35,572 --> 00:26:37,032
That's what life on Earth is for.

428
00:26:37,324 --> 00:26:38,617
Very witty.

429
00:26:41,371 --> 00:26:42,789
Okay. Here we are.

430
00:26:42,956 --> 00:26:45,124
This is the Hall of Everything.

431
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:46,668
Whoa!

432
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:57,180
Yes!

433
00:27:03,187 --> 00:27:04,522
- Whoa.
- Congratulations!

434
00:27:04,605 --> 00:27:05,606
So, where do you want to start?

435
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,732
Come on.

436
00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:10,946
Croissants, cakes.
Baking could be your spark.

437
00:27:11,113 --> 00:27:13,365
Yeah! But, um, I don't get it.

438
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:15,409
- Just smell it.
- Can't, and neither can you.

439
00:27:15,575 --> 00:27:16,619
What?

440
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:18,621
You're right. I can't smell.

441
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:20,748
We can't...
We can't taste, either?

442
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:22,625
All that stuff is in your body.

443
00:27:23,502 --> 00:27:26,964
- No smell, no taste.
- Or touch. See?

444
00:27:30,677 --> 00:27:32,929
Okay, I get it. Moving on.

445
00:27:33,638 --> 00:27:34,723
Isn't this exciting?

446
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:36,642
The fire is so pretty.

447
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:38,227
I kinda wanna let it spread.

448
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:39,312
Nope.

449
00:27:40,229 --> 00:27:41,397
Hands are hard.

450
00:27:41,564 --> 00:27:43,024
How about a librarian?
They're cool.

451
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,401
Yes, amazing.

452
00:27:44,484 --> 00:27:45,944
Who wouldn't like working
at a thankless job

453
00:27:46,028 --> 00:27:48,363
you're always in danger of
losing due to budget cuts?

454
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,325
Though I do like the idea
of randomly shushing people.

455
00:27:50,491 --> 00:27:51,618
- Look, obviously this...
- Shh!

456
00:27:51,701 --> 00:27:52,869
Oh, yeah, that's good.

457
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,621
Meh.

458
00:27:55,622 --> 00:27:56,623
Meh.

459
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,334
Meh.

460
00:28:01,045 --> 00:28:03,130
Meh.

461
00:28:05,258 --> 00:28:07,594
Well, I think that's everything.

462
00:28:07,761 --> 00:28:09,638
- Sorry.
- You told me you'd try.

463
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:11,891
I did. I'm telling the truth.

464
00:28:11,974 --> 00:28:13,768
If there's one thing I'm not, it's a liar.

465
00:28:13,851 --> 00:28:15,269
Unlike Abraham Lincoln.

466
00:28:15,436 --> 00:28:17,438
You're really okay being on a penny?

467
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:19,316
Well, of course. It's an honour.

468
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:21,777
Okay, but they put
Andrew Jackson on the 20.

469
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,944
Jackson!

470
00:28:23,028 --> 00:28:24,989
What can I say, Joe?
Earth is boring.

471
00:28:25,073 --> 00:28:26,157
Well, what else can we do, then?

472
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,325
Because we're running out of time.

473
00:28:27,408 --> 00:28:29,202
Yeah, you know,
time's not really a thing here.

474
00:28:29,285 --> 00:28:30,870
Time's up!

475
00:28:30,954 --> 00:28:33,082
Nice try, Bjorn, but no need to feel bad.

476
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:34,750
22 here can be a bit of a challenge.

477
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:36,460
Even though I can't feel it,
please don't touch me.

478
00:28:36,627 --> 00:28:38,295
So, let's get you to the Great Beyond.

479
00:28:40,674 --> 00:28:44,010
Um, wait.
We forgot to try breakdancer.

480
00:28:44,177 --> 00:28:45,972
Yeah! I think that's gonna be my thing.

481
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:48,182
Poppin' and lockin'. Windmills.

482
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:50,101
Settling my disputes with dance.

483
00:28:50,184 --> 00:28:52,521
Can we have one more minute
to go back and try breakdancer?

484
00:28:52,604 --> 00:28:53,772
Please, Jerry?

485
00:28:53,855 --> 00:28:54,982
You look really good today, Jerry.

486
00:28:55,148 --> 00:28:58,360
Oh, okay.
I've never seen 22 this enthused.

487
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,738
Good for you, Dr Börgensson.

488
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:03,950
Run.

489
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,246
In here.

490
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:17,716
Here it is.

491
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:19,718
Where does it lead?

492
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:20,928
Hey, you ask too many questions.

493
00:29:21,012 --> 00:29:22,221
How about you zip it for a minute, m'kay?

494
00:29:22,305 --> 00:29:24,348
- And we're going there why?
- 'Cause I know a guy there.

495
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:25,891
A guy who can help.
A guy like you.

496
00:29:25,975 --> 00:29:28,228
Like me? As in, alive?

497
00:29:28,687 --> 00:29:31,398
Wait, are you actually helping me?

498
00:29:31,565 --> 00:29:33,483
Joe, I have been here
for who knows how long,

499
00:29:33,693 --> 00:29:36,070
and I've never seen anything
that's made me want to live.

500
00:29:36,237 --> 00:29:40,033
And then, you come along.
Your life is sad and pathetic.

501
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:42,703
And you're working so hard
to get back to it.

502
00:29:42,786 --> 00:29:45,080
Why? I mean, this I gotta see.

503
00:29:45,247 --> 00:29:46,623
Okay, let's go.

504
00:29:55,468 --> 00:29:56,844
What is this place?

505
00:29:56,927 --> 00:29:59,055
You know how when you humans
are really into something

506
00:29:59,221 --> 00:30:01,391
and it feels like you're in another place?

507
00:30:01,475 --> 00:30:03,602
Feels like you're in the zone, right?

508
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:05,479
- Yeah.
- Well, this is the zone.

509
00:30:05,646 --> 00:30:07,731
It's the space between
the physical and spiritual.

510
00:30:07,898 --> 00:30:11,194
Wait a minute. I was here.
Today, doing my audition.

511
00:30:11,361 --> 00:30:14,322
This must be where musicians come
when they get into a flow.

512
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:16,742
Not just musicians. Watch this.

513
00:30:16,909 --> 00:30:20,412
O, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou...

514
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:21,830
Line!

515
00:30:24,626 --> 00:30:25,627
Oops.

516
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,711
Check this out.

517
00:30:26,795 --> 00:30:29,131
I have been messing
with this team for decades.

518
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,760
<i>And the Knicks
lose another one.</i>

519
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:35,304
All right. All right.
Where's this guy you know?

520
00:30:35,388 --> 00:30:36,390
I gotta get back to my gig.

521
00:30:36,473 --> 00:30:38,517
- Okay. I mean, he's usually down here.
- What the...

522
00:30:38,892 --> 00:30:39,893
Make a trade.

523
00:30:39,977 --> 00:30:42,229
Make a trade. Make a trade.

524
00:30:42,354 --> 00:30:43,398
- What is that?
- Shh!

525
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,942
Make a trade. Make a trade.

526
00:30:46,025 --> 00:30:47,026
Run!

527
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,695
Make a trade,
make a trade, make a trade!

528
00:31:07,508 --> 00:31:10,137
Oh! Ahoy there, fellow astral travellers.

529
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,972
Good to see you again, 22.

530
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:14,057
Moonwind, how are ya?

531
00:31:14,224 --> 00:31:15,809
On the brink of madness,
thanks for asking.

532
00:31:15,976 --> 00:31:17,061
Hey, got a request for you.

533
00:31:17,145 --> 00:31:19,564
Uh, yeah.
I'm trying to get back to my body.

534
00:31:19,647 --> 00:31:20,773
Can you help me?

535
00:31:20,857 --> 00:31:22,358
That's what we do.

536
00:31:22,442 --> 00:31:24,278
We are the mystics without borders.

537
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:27,323
Devoted to helping
the lost souls of Earth find their way.

538
00:31:27,489 --> 00:31:29,241
I'm Moonwind Stardancer at your service.

539
00:31:29,408 --> 00:31:31,578
That's Windstar Dreamermoon,
Dancerstar Windmoon,

540
00:31:31,745 --> 00:31:33,079
and that's Dreamerwind Dreamerdreamer.

541
00:31:33,163 --> 00:31:34,372
These weirdos are going
to help me get back?

542
00:31:34,456 --> 00:31:35,457
Just wait.

543
00:31:35,957 --> 00:31:38,210
Let's get this lost soul back home.

544
00:31:39,045 --> 00:31:40,838
Make a trade.

545
00:31:40,921 --> 00:31:42,840
Make a trade. Make a trade.

546
00:31:42,923 --> 00:31:43,924
Poor fellow.

547
00:31:44,342 --> 00:31:47,304
Some people just can't let go
of their own anxieties and obsessions,

548
00:31:47,387 --> 00:31:49,514
leaving them lost
and disconnected from life.

549
00:31:49,598 --> 00:31:51,350
And this is the result.

550
00:31:51,517 --> 00:31:53,311
Make a trade. Make a trade.

551
00:31:53,394 --> 00:31:55,146
Make a trade. Make a trade.

552
00:31:55,229 --> 00:31:56,856
Make a trade?

553
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,859
Looks like another hedge fund manager.

554
00:31:59,026 --> 00:32:02,738
Now, to reconnect to your earthly body.

555
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,953
Whoa. That's me.

556
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:10,372
Thank you.

557
00:32:15,127 --> 00:32:17,213
What am I doing with my life?

558
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:22,511
I'm alive! I'm alive! Free yourselves!

559
00:32:22,594 --> 00:32:24,513
It's beautiful!

560
00:32:24,805 --> 00:32:27,016
Whoa. He got back just like that?

561
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,686
So this is all I had to do
to get back to my body?

562
00:32:31,896 --> 00:32:34,149
Egads, man!

563
00:32:34,316 --> 00:32:36,318
Joe, are you dead?

564
00:32:36,485 --> 00:32:38,487
No, no. Well, not yet.

565
00:32:38,862 --> 00:32:39,864
Can you help me get back?

566
00:32:40,031 --> 00:32:43,660
We've never connected an untethered soul
back to its body before.

567
00:32:43,743 --> 00:32:47,331
But perhaps if we travel to a thin spot...

568
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:48,582
Yes! All aboard!

569
00:32:48,916 --> 00:32:50,710
Anchors away!

570
00:33:00,053 --> 00:33:02,765
So if your souls are here,
where are your bodies?

571
00:33:02,932 --> 00:33:04,434
Well, on Earth, of course.

572
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,352
My body is in a trance in Palawan.

573
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:08,772
I'm playing the Saraswati <i>veena</i> in Tibet.

574
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:11,316
I'm a shamanic healer
meditating in Berkeley, California.

575
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,195
Mm-hmm. And let me guess,
you're drumming, chanting, and meditating?

576
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,822
Yes. Something like that.

577
00:33:19,576 --> 00:33:21,912
I'm in New York City,
on the corner of 14th and 7th.

578
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:23,831
Oh, yeah, that's right up
from Tony Tony Tonios.

579
00:33:23,998 --> 00:33:25,333
Yes, precisely.

580
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:27,710
And what about you?
I thought you hated Earth.

581
00:33:27,877 --> 00:33:29,087
Yeah, I'm not stuck with a body.

582
00:33:29,171 --> 00:33:30,756
So I can go wherever I want.

583
00:33:30,922 --> 00:33:32,382
I'm a nobody, get it?

584
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:36,095
We mystics meet in this glorious landscape
every Tuesday.

585
00:33:41,935 --> 00:33:44,229
So many of them. Sad.

586
00:33:44,396 --> 00:33:46,899
You know,
lost souls are not that different

587
00:33:46,982 --> 00:33:48,233
from those in the zone.

588
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,487
- What?
- The zone is enjoyable,

589
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:54,741
but when that joy becomes an obsession,
one becomes disconnected from life.

590
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:55,826
Gotta find it.

591
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,828
Gotta find it. Gotta find it.

592
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:01,374
For a time, I was a lost soul myself.

593
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,377
- Really?
- Tetris.

594
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,967
There you are.

595
00:34:10,051 --> 00:34:12,095
We'll have you back in no time.

596
00:34:16,225 --> 00:34:18,143
Now, since you don't have
a connection to your body,

597
00:34:18,227 --> 00:34:22,398
you will have to tune back
into your physical surroundings.

598
00:34:25,402 --> 00:34:26,486
Close your eyes.

599
00:34:26,569 --> 00:34:29,572
Breathe into your crown chakra.

600
00:34:32,785 --> 00:34:34,495
Do we really need all this?

601
00:34:34,662 --> 00:34:36,497
Yes!

602
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:39,835
Do you have a piano on board?
I could focus with that.

603
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,254
No pianos, Joe. You must focus.

604
00:34:42,546 --> 00:34:44,424
Imagine silence.

605
00:34:44,507 --> 00:34:45,967
Shh.

606
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:51,056
Now, concentrate on where your body is.

607
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:53,183
Listen for cues.

608
00:35:05,156 --> 00:35:07,116
That's it. You're doing it.

609
00:35:10,036 --> 00:35:11,830
No peeking.
Maintain your meditative state

610
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:12,956
or you'll break the connection.

611
00:35:13,498 --> 00:35:18,463
Now, see if you can smell
and feel where your body is.

612
00:35:19,088 --> 00:35:22,425
I hear a heart monitor.

613
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,723
I can smell hand sanitiser.

614
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,434
<i>Yes. Yes! Good.</i>

615
00:35:30,517 --> 00:35:32,729
<i>I think I can feel my feet.</i>

616
00:35:33,355 --> 00:35:35,106
Hmm. I feel fur.

617
00:35:35,648 --> 00:35:37,192
Did you find a next of kin?

618
00:35:37,275 --> 00:35:39,487
I feel fur.

619
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,613
Did you hear that?

620
00:35:40,696 --> 00:35:42,782
Oh, the therapy cat is working.

621
00:35:43,282 --> 00:35:45,576
Am I close?
When can I jump in?

622
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:47,120
Look! There I am.

623
00:35:47,662 --> 00:35:48,789
There I am.

624
00:35:48,872 --> 00:35:50,874
His heart rate is increasing.

625
00:35:50,957 --> 00:35:51,958
I'll get the doctor.

626
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:53,252
Mr Mittens, you stay right there.

627
00:35:53,336 --> 00:35:54,587
- What are we waiting for?
- No, Joe, don't rush this.

628
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,547
- It's not the right time.
- No, it's my time.

629
00:35:56,631 --> 00:35:57,799
Wait, not me!

630
00:36:14,735 --> 00:36:17,988
I did it.
I did it! I'm back.

631
00:36:19,699 --> 00:36:20,742
What the...

632
00:36:22,369 --> 00:36:23,370
No.

633
00:36:24,663 --> 00:36:26,957
No. No. No.

634
00:36:27,124 --> 00:36:28,459
I'm in the cat?

635
00:36:28,626 --> 00:36:30,336
Wait a minute.
If I'm in here, then who...

636
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,463
- What?
- You're in my body!

637
00:36:32,547 --> 00:36:34,675
- You're in the cat?
- Wait, wait, that's my body.

638
00:36:34,758 --> 00:36:37,511
- I'm in a body! No!
- Why are you in my body?

639
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,346
I don't wanna be a cat.
I hate cats!

640
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:40,597
Oh, it's disgusting.

641
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:42,350
That Moonwind guy, he messed this up.

642
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:45,562
Doc, you gotta help me.
That's my body, but I'm trapped...

643
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:50,609
Oh, no, they can't understand me.

644
00:36:50,693 --> 00:36:52,445
They think you're me.
You gotta try.

645
00:36:52,528 --> 00:36:54,948
Miss Doctor, we have a problem.

646
00:36:55,032 --> 00:36:57,492
I'm an unborn soul
and I wanna stay at the You Seminar.

647
00:36:57,576 --> 00:36:59,411
Yes, well, that drug doesn't
seem to be working at all.

648
00:36:59,494 --> 00:37:00,662
No, no, no, you don't understand.

649
00:37:00,746 --> 00:37:01,748
- I'm not Mr Gardner.
- Shh!

650
00:37:01,831 --> 00:37:02,957
They're gonna think you're nuts.

651
00:37:03,041 --> 00:37:04,125
I mean, that I'm nuts.

652
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:05,293
Oh, how did this happen?

653
00:37:05,376 --> 00:37:07,670
I fell into your body because
it doesn't have a soul.

654
00:37:07,754 --> 00:37:09,381
Then why am I in a cat?

655
00:37:09,465 --> 00:37:10,924
I don't know!

656
00:37:13,343 --> 00:37:15,638
Is there anyone we can call, Mr Gardner?

657
00:37:15,722 --> 00:37:17,265
A next of kin or friend?

658
00:37:17,432 --> 00:37:19,350
- Tell her no.
- Uh, no.

659
00:37:19,517 --> 00:37:20,685
Can you tell me what day it is?

660
00:37:20,852 --> 00:37:22,103
It's the worst day of my life.

661
00:37:22,187 --> 00:37:23,647
I don't wanna be here. I hate Earth.

662
00:37:23,814 --> 00:37:25,566
Tell you what.
We're going to keep you here

663
00:37:25,649 --> 00:37:27,359
for observation. Just for a bit.

664
00:37:27,526 --> 00:37:29,613
Perhaps our therapy cat can go
to his next appointment.

665
00:37:29,696 --> 00:37:30,947
Okay. Okay.

666
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:33,033
- You gotta talk to her.
- Okay.

667
00:37:33,116 --> 00:37:35,535
Miss Doctor,
this body's soul is in this cat.

668
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:36,621
Stop talking.

669
00:37:36,704 --> 00:37:37,997
So naturally, he wants to stay close.

670
00:37:38,164 --> 00:37:40,291
Uh, keep the cat.
Just get some rest.

671
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:41,542
A lot of it. Okay?

672
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,754
I'll come get Mr Mittens in ten minutes.

673
00:37:44,254 --> 00:37:45,547
Ten minutes?
We gotta get outta here.

674
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:48,509
No way! I am not moving!

675
00:37:48,675 --> 00:37:51,930
I can't believe I'm in a body
on this hellish planet.

676
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:53,973
I have bendy meat sticks.

677
00:37:54,057 --> 00:37:56,894
I can feel myself feeling myself.

678
00:37:56,977 --> 00:37:59,105
Hey! Focus! Listen to me.

679
00:37:59,188 --> 00:38:00,856
We gotta get out of here
before they take me away.

680
00:38:01,023 --> 00:38:02,983
Take you away?
You're gonna leave me?

681
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,736
No way! That's my body you're in.

682
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,113
Okay, do you think you can walk?

683
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:07,406
I don't know!

684
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:09,991
I failed Body Test Drive, like, 436 times.

685
00:38:10,158 --> 00:38:11,661
But will you try?

686
00:38:14,497 --> 00:38:17,458
Okay. Gotta find Moonwind,
he can fix this.

687
00:38:18,752 --> 00:38:20,379
I'm a cat. I can make this.

688
00:38:26,344 --> 00:38:28,346
Okay, come on, you're doing great.

689
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,724
Keep going. Keep going.

690
00:38:30,807 --> 00:38:32,643
I'm just gonna rest here for a minute.

691
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,479
No, no, no, no.
They'll be back any minute. Come on.

692
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:37,314
Okay!

693
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:50,538
In here!

694
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,213
Whoa.

695
00:38:59,549 --> 00:39:00,759
Okay, good.

696
00:39:01,926 --> 00:39:04,137
Now push the down button.

697
00:39:05,138 --> 00:39:07,391
Move your... Nope. Careful.

698
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:08,642
Those fingers are my livelihood.

699
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:12,898
Ugh.

700
00:39:12,981 --> 00:39:14,775
Now get in.

701
00:39:17,152 --> 00:39:18,403
Phew!

702
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:21,616
Hmm.

703
00:39:23,993 --> 00:39:25,828
Hmm.

704
00:39:25,912 --> 00:39:27,372
Okay, what did Moonwind say?

705
00:39:27,456 --> 00:39:29,416
He said on the corner of 14th and 7th.

706
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,543
Yeah, that's Chelsea.
Near Jackson Square Park.

707
00:39:31,627 --> 00:39:33,296
Exactly. Wait.
How do you know all that?

708
00:39:33,379 --> 00:39:34,798
It's all in this stupid brain of yours.

709
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:36,383
Hey, hey, hey, stay outta there.

710
00:39:36,466 --> 00:39:38,218
Oh, relax. There's not much here.

711
00:39:38,385 --> 00:39:39,844
Jazz, jazz, more jazz.

712
00:39:39,928 --> 00:39:41,555
Oh, and someone named Lisa.
Who's that?

713
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:42,681
Uh, never mind.

714
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:55,071
I, um...

715
00:39:55,154 --> 00:39:56,364
It's all happening too fast, you know.

716
00:39:56,447 --> 00:39:57,698
Let's just take a minute and, um...

717
00:39:57,782 --> 00:39:59,909
Come on, let's go.
They could be here any second.

718
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,174
Don't worry, it's okay.
Just keep walking.

719
00:40:18,472 --> 00:40:19,473
Aah!

720
00:40:19,557 --> 00:40:20,599
No, don't stop.
What are you doing?

721
00:40:20,683 --> 00:40:21,685
This is New York City.

722
00:40:21,768 --> 00:40:24,271
You don't stop in the middle
of the street. Go, go, go.

723
00:40:29,652 --> 00:40:31,779
Oh, no. 22. 22!

724
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:36,535
22. Oh, no.
Oh, no. 22. 22.

725
00:40:36,702 --> 00:40:38,412
22! 22!

726
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,671
22, I didn't know I had claws, okay?

727
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:48,840
Look, I'm sorry.
But come on, let's go.

728
00:40:48,923 --> 00:40:49,925
No way.

729
00:40:50,009 --> 00:40:52,887
I am staying right here
until your stupid body dies.

730
00:40:53,053 --> 00:40:55,973
Which will happen any minute now
because your stomach is earthquaking.

731
00:41:09,907 --> 00:41:11,575
Yeah, this place is worse than I thought.

732
00:41:11,658 --> 00:41:13,994
It's loud, and bright, and...

733
00:41:14,078 --> 00:41:16,163
Hmm.
What is that in my nose?

734
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:17,916
That's smell.

735
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:21,086
And if you think that's good,
just imagine what it tastes like.

736
00:41:21,503 --> 00:41:23,505
Hmm.

737
00:41:23,589 --> 00:41:24,632
Go on.

738
00:41:32,766 --> 00:41:35,435
It's so good!

739
00:41:36,478 --> 00:41:37,730
It's, uh...

740
00:41:37,814 --> 00:41:39,524
It's not horrible.

741
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,776
Good. You can eat on the way.
Let's go.

742
00:41:42,985 --> 00:41:46,365
Or you just take a few minutes. Sure.

743
00:41:49,076 --> 00:41:51,371
Hmm. Strange,
I don't feel so angry anymore.

744
00:41:51,538 --> 00:41:54,124
That's great.
Ready to find Moonwind?

745
00:41:54,999 --> 00:41:56,000
Maybe.

746
00:41:56,167 --> 00:41:58,671
I'm telling you, Joe,
it's pronounced yee-row.

747
00:41:58,754 --> 00:42:01,215
Yeah, but in New York,
we call them gyros. It's Greek.

748
00:42:01,298 --> 00:42:02,883
No, I got in a fight
with Archimedes about this.

749
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:03,968
He said it's...

750
00:42:04,051 --> 00:42:05,512
- Yee-row.
- Yo-yo.

751
00:42:05,595 --> 00:42:06,805
- Yee-row.
- YOLO.

752
00:42:06,888 --> 00:42:07,889
- Yee-row.
- Sergio?

753
00:42:07,973 --> 00:42:08,974
Yee-row!

754
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,767
I miss that guy.

755
00:42:10,934 --> 00:42:12,562
This is 14th and 7th.

756
00:42:14,355 --> 00:42:15,648
That's gotta be him.

757
00:42:18,609 --> 00:42:20,320
Moonwind, you gotta help me.

758
00:42:23,198 --> 00:42:24,992
Joe! You made it into your body.

759
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:26,244
No, he didn't.

760
00:42:26,327 --> 00:42:28,037
That is my body.

761
00:42:28,204 --> 00:42:29,789
You're in a cat?

762
00:42:29,956 --> 00:42:31,124
That's marvellous!

763
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:32,417
Hey, Moonwimp!

764
00:42:32,501 --> 00:42:34,587
That sign won't spin by itself, hear me?

765
00:42:34,754 --> 00:42:37,840
But, Marge, look!
I put this man's soul in a cat.

766
00:42:38,007 --> 00:42:39,341
Who cares? And you!

767
00:42:39,509 --> 00:42:42,387
We only have room for
one weirdo here, so, scram!

768
00:42:42,554 --> 00:42:43,722
Get back to work!

769
00:42:43,889 --> 00:42:45,307
No one understands my art.

770
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,392
Moonwind, listen,

771
00:42:46,476 --> 00:42:49,061
I gotta get out of here and back in there.

772
00:42:49,228 --> 00:42:50,229
Well, we'll have to perform

773
00:42:50,313 --> 00:42:52,190
an old-fashioned astral
transmigration displacement.

774
00:42:52,273 --> 00:42:53,484
- A what?
- It's simply a way

775
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,985
to get your souls back where they belong.

776
00:42:55,068 --> 00:42:56,612
And it's a glorious ritual, indeed,

777
00:42:56,695 --> 00:42:59,448
full of chanting, dancing,
and best of all, bongos.

778
00:42:59,615 --> 00:43:02,786
I need to be at The Half Note by 7:00,
so this needs to happen right now.

779
00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:04,454
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not so fast.

780
00:43:04,621 --> 00:43:06,831
You must wait for another thin spot

781
00:43:06,915 --> 00:43:08,793
to open between Earth
and the astral plane.

782
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:10,127
And that won't occur

783
00:43:10,211 --> 00:43:12,671
until Orcus moves
into the house of Gemini.

784
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:13,840
When is that?

785
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,592
Well, the government calls it 6:30.

786
00:43:15,675 --> 00:43:16,760
Look, I'll meet you at The Half Note.

787
00:43:16,843 --> 00:43:17,844
6:30? You serious?

788
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,221
I'll gather all
the necessary provisions...

789
00:43:19,304 --> 00:43:21,891
I said, get out of here! Go!

790
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,309
See you
at The Half Note at 6:30!

791
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,560
I'll take care of everything!

792
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,521
And stay away!

793
00:43:34,531 --> 00:43:36,533
Sure are a lot of Garcias in here.

794
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:41,705
You're out there somewhere, little soul,

795
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:43,958
and I'm gonna find ya.

796
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:46,377
All right, this is the last snack.

797
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,463
I can barely fit into my pants as it is.

798
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,424
6:30 is cutting it close. Too close.

799
00:43:50,507 --> 00:43:53,301
We gotta get back to my place
and get you cleaned up and...

800
00:43:53,385 --> 00:43:55,680
Ahh!

801
00:43:55,763 --> 00:43:58,057
We gotta hail a cab.
Hold your hand out.

802
00:43:58,224 --> 00:43:59,600
Hold it up and out.

803
00:44:00,184 --> 00:44:03,021
Man, this would be hard
even if I wasn't wearing a hospital gown.

804
00:44:05,607 --> 00:44:07,526
Go, go, go!
Just run to that one.

805
00:44:13,658 --> 00:44:15,827
Is that Teach?

806
00:44:15,911 --> 00:44:17,538
Mm, pepperoni.

807
00:44:31,721 --> 00:44:33,139
Aah, Dorothea Williams saw me.

808
00:44:33,222 --> 00:44:35,266
What am I gonna do?
She's gonna think I'm crazy.

809
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:36,602
Maybe you should call her up

810
00:44:36,685 --> 00:44:38,395
and tell her that we're not crazy.

811
00:44:38,562 --> 00:44:41,774
I've only been a person for an hour,
and even I know that's a bad idea.

812
00:44:42,608 --> 00:44:45,487
I just gotta get back in my body
and really bring it tonight.

813
00:44:45,653 --> 00:44:48,281
How come this part is stinky
but this part smells fine?

814
00:44:48,448 --> 00:44:50,826
Never mind.
Just put those pants on.

815
00:44:50,993 --> 00:44:52,203
Sheesh, I can't believe I've been

816
00:44:52,286 --> 00:44:53,537
walking around in this city
with no pants on.

817
00:44:53,621 --> 00:44:55,122
I don't even wanna be here, remember?

818
00:44:55,206 --> 00:44:56,665
I don't want you here either. I just...

819
00:44:56,749 --> 00:44:58,960
I just wanna get back to my body,

820
00:44:59,127 --> 00:45:02,255
then get back to the club.

821
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:03,882
What's the matter with you?

822
00:45:03,965 --> 00:45:06,928
Uh... I don't know.
It's the sun. It's just so...

823
00:45:08,596 --> 00:45:09,597
My phone!

824
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,225
Um... Okay, your clothes
are rumbling again.

825
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:14,770
Curley! Uh... No, no.

826
00:45:19,943 --> 00:45:20,985
Oops.

827
00:45:25,533 --> 00:45:28,327
<i>Hey, Mr G, it's Curley.
Um...</i>

828
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:29,620
<i>I hope you're doin' okay.</i>

829
00:45:29,787 --> 00:45:33,500
<i>Dorothea freaked out when she saw you,
and she called this other guy, Robert.</i>

830
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:35,085
<i>He's got the gig now. I'm sorry.</i>

831
00:45:35,168 --> 00:45:36,670
No, no, no.

832
00:45:36,753 --> 00:45:37,754
<i>Look, honestly,</i>

833
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:40,550
<i>your class was the only reason
I went to school at all.</i>

834
00:45:40,716 --> 00:45:42,301
<i>Like, I owe you a lot.</i>

835
00:45:42,385 --> 00:45:43,511
<i>So, here's the plan.</i>

836
00:45:43,594 --> 00:45:45,138
<i>Clean yourself up, put on a killer suit,</i>

837
00:45:45,221 --> 00:45:46,849
<i>and get to the club early.</i>

838
00:45:47,015 --> 00:45:48,892
<i>I'm gonna try and talk to her.</i>

839
00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:51,979
<i>Just make sure you show up
looking like a million bucks, all right?</i>

840
00:45:52,522 --> 00:45:54,399
<i>I hope I see you, man.
All right. Peace.</i>

841
00:45:54,482 --> 00:45:56,359
Oh! I can get the gig back, 22.

842
00:45:56,443 --> 00:45:57,735
I need your help. I have a suit.

843
00:45:58,069 --> 00:45:59,195
I'm gonna need you to try it on.

844
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,281
No, no, no.

845
00:46:00,364 --> 00:46:01,949
And then I can line
my hair up a little bit,

846
00:46:02,032 --> 00:46:04,243
- and I can...
- Nope. No way, no how.

847
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:05,536
22!

848
00:46:09,124 --> 00:46:10,667
- Mr Gardner?
- Ah!

849
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,210
It's Connie.
She's here for her lesson.

850
00:46:12,294 --> 00:46:14,005
- What do I do?
- I can hear you!

851
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:15,673
Just tell her that you can't do it today.

852
00:46:16,424 --> 00:46:17,425
Hi, Connie.

853
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:18,593
Sorry, but Joe can't do it today.

854
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:19,802
- You're Joe!
- I mean, me.

855
00:46:19,886 --> 00:46:21,054
Me can't do it today.

856
00:46:21,138 --> 00:46:22,764
Good. Now let's go
check out that suit.

857
00:46:22,848 --> 00:46:24,933
I came to tell you that I quit.

858
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,101
Quit?

859
00:46:26,185 --> 00:46:28,146
We don't have time for this.
The suit is in the closet.

860
00:46:28,229 --> 00:46:31,024
Band is a stupid waste of time.

861
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:32,317
This kid is talking sense.

862
00:46:32,484 --> 00:46:33,485
What are you doing?

863
00:46:36,322 --> 00:46:38,574
Here, I quit.
I think jazz is pointless.

864
00:46:38,657 --> 00:46:40,786
Oh, yeah, jazz is definitely pointless.

865
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:41,870
Hey!

866
00:46:41,953 --> 00:46:43,997
In fact, all of school is a waste of time.

867
00:46:45,832 --> 00:46:48,461
Of course. Like my mentor,
George Orwell, used to say,

868
00:46:48,544 --> 00:46:49,796
"State sponsored education

869
00:46:49,879 --> 00:46:52,423
"is like the rattling of a stick
inside a swill bucket."

870
00:46:52,507 --> 00:46:53,633
Yeah!

871
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,886
The ruling class's core
curriculum stifles dissent.

872
00:46:55,969 --> 00:46:57,304
It's the oldest trick in the book.

873
00:46:57,387 --> 00:46:58,388
What are you talkin' about?

874
00:46:58,472 --> 00:46:59,515
She doesn't care about any of that.

875
00:46:59,598 --> 00:47:01,518
I've been saying that
since the third grade.

876
00:47:01,601 --> 00:47:03,520
You know, you seem really smart.

877
00:47:03,686 --> 00:47:05,563
What is your position on pizza?

878
00:47:05,647 --> 00:47:08,192
- Uh, I like it?
- Me, too!

879
00:47:08,275 --> 00:47:10,236
What are you doing?

880
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,862
I'd rather hang with Connie.

881
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:14,073
What? Come back here!
You open this...

882
00:47:16,368 --> 00:47:18,829
Um, I think your cat wants to get out.

883
00:47:18,912 --> 00:47:20,205
Ugh, he thinks he knows everything.

884
00:47:20,372 --> 00:47:22,166
22! Don't you walk away from me.

885
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:23,251
Come here right now.

886
00:47:23,334 --> 00:47:25,211
I'm gonna go in
and I'mma scratch up the sofa.

887
00:47:25,378 --> 00:47:26,629
Oh, wait a minute, that's my sofa.

888
00:47:26,796 --> 00:47:28,339
You really got things figured out, Connie.

889
00:47:28,422 --> 00:47:31,510
I'd better give this back.
It belongs to the school.

890
00:47:31,593 --> 00:47:32,636
Sure.

891
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:34,138
You know, I really am glad
there's someone else

892
00:47:34,221 --> 00:47:35,765
who sees how ridiculous this place is.

893
00:47:35,849 --> 00:47:37,433
You're right to quit.
I learned about quitting...

894
00:47:37,517 --> 00:47:38,643
You know what, Mr G?

895
00:47:38,726 --> 00:47:40,353
I was practising this one thing yesterday

896
00:47:40,436 --> 00:47:44,024
and maybe you can listen to it
and tell me to quit after, okay?

897
00:47:47,278 --> 00:47:49,071
Uh, okay.

898
00:48:19,732 --> 00:48:22,735
Wow. You really love this.

899
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:24,779
Yeah.

900
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:28,408
So, maybe I'd better stick with it?

901
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:29,993
Yeah.

902
00:48:30,368 --> 00:48:31,579
Bye, Mr G.

903
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:33,080
See you next week!

904
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:34,624
22!

905
00:48:35,666 --> 00:48:38,128
So, Connie came here to quit,

906
00:48:38,212 --> 00:48:39,213
but then she didn't.

907
00:48:39,296 --> 00:48:40,714
22, forget about that. Listen.

908
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:42,800
I need to know this, Joe.
Why didn't she quit?

909
00:48:42,966 --> 00:48:44,051
Because she loves to play.

910
00:48:44,134 --> 00:48:47,639
She might say she hates everything,
but trombone is her thing.

911
00:48:47,806 --> 00:48:48,973
She's good at it.

912
00:48:49,057 --> 00:48:51,392
Maybe trombone is her spark, I don't know.

913
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:55,105
Please. If I'm gonna get this gig back,
I need your help.

914
00:48:55,773 --> 00:48:56,774
Okay.

915
00:48:57,149 --> 00:48:58,150
Really?

916
00:48:58,234 --> 00:49:01,279
I'll help you,
but I wanna try a few things.

917
00:49:01,363 --> 00:49:02,489
'Cause I don't know,

918
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:05,827
some of it's not as boring
as it is at the You Seminar,

919
00:49:05,993 --> 00:49:07,912
and if Connie can find
something she loves here,

920
00:49:07,995 --> 00:49:09,330
maybe I can, too.

921
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,916
- Great!
- So, what do we do first?

922
00:49:15,295 --> 00:49:16,880
- This water hurts!
- It's okay.

923
00:49:16,964 --> 00:49:18,590
You just have to turn the other knob.

924
00:49:18,674 --> 00:49:19,759
Oh, okay, that's better.

925
00:49:19,843 --> 00:49:21,010
And I wouldn't be mad

926
00:49:21,094 --> 00:49:23,179
if you put a little lotion
on me when you're done.

927
00:49:27,977 --> 00:49:29,770
I washed your butt for you.

928
00:49:31,021 --> 00:49:32,898
Ah! Spicy! Spicy!

929
00:49:38,905 --> 00:49:41,075
You five will be insecure.

930
00:49:41,242 --> 00:49:43,870
And you 12 will be self-absorbed.

931
00:49:44,036 --> 00:49:46,539
We really should stop sending
so many through that pavilion.

932
00:49:46,707 --> 00:49:47,708
Found him!

933
00:49:47,791 --> 00:49:48,792
See that, everybody?

934
00:49:48,876 --> 00:49:50,210
Who figured out why the count's off?

935
00:49:50,294 --> 00:49:51,295
That's right, Terry did.

936
00:49:51,378 --> 00:49:52,421
It's Terrytime.

937
00:49:52,588 --> 00:49:54,841
- Wow. Nice work.
- Well, who is it?

938
00:49:55,008 --> 00:49:56,426
Right.

939
00:49:56,509 --> 00:49:59,304
Uh... Joe Gardner is his name.

940
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:01,390
Looks like he's back down on Earth.

941
00:50:01,474 --> 00:50:02,475
That's not good.

942
00:50:02,558 --> 00:50:04,059
That... That's the mentor
we set up with 22.

943
00:50:04,226 --> 00:50:06,520
All right, all right.
Easy on the hysterics.

944
00:50:06,687 --> 00:50:09,483
Terry's got this under control.
I'll handle it.

945
00:50:09,566 --> 00:50:10,567
How?

946
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:11,651
I'll go down there and get him.

947
00:50:11,735 --> 00:50:13,069
Set the count right, lickety-split.

948
00:50:13,153 --> 00:50:15,114
Okay, whoa.
Are you sure that's a good idea?

949
00:50:15,198 --> 00:50:17,450
Look, you all are the ones who beefed it.

950
00:50:17,533 --> 00:50:19,076
I'm trying to un-beef it.

951
00:50:19,577 --> 00:50:21,078
But you cannot be seen.

952
00:50:21,246 --> 00:50:22,456
By anyone.

953
00:50:22,539 --> 00:50:25,626
Don't worry. I'll make sure
no one else sees me.

954
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:28,755
I'll move among the shadows, like a ninja.

955
00:50:28,922 --> 00:50:31,257
Please, just do it quickly and quietly.

956
00:50:31,424 --> 00:50:34,344
And also quickly.
And quietly as well.

957
00:50:37,932 --> 00:50:40,935
This won't be a disaster, that's for sure.

958
00:50:41,937 --> 00:50:45,482
Mm. Trusty old brown suit.
Still a perfect fit.

959
00:50:45,649 --> 00:50:47,651
It's a little tight in the back-here part.

960
00:50:47,818 --> 00:50:49,612
It'll loosen. Sit down.

961
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:52,031
I'm a cat.

962
00:50:53,324 --> 00:50:54,367
I'll do it.

963
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:55,576
You couldn't call an elevator, remember?

964
00:50:55,661 --> 00:50:58,872
No way. I just need to line me up.
Now be still.

965
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:03,962
Uh, it's like a little tiny chainsaw.

966
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:06,297
- Don't move.
- I'm not moving. You're moving.

967
00:51:14,932 --> 00:51:16,267
Oh, no!

968
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,477
Don't worry, I'm okay.

969
00:51:17,561 --> 00:51:20,438
Oh, no, no, no! My hair!
My hair is not okay!

970
00:51:20,522 --> 00:51:21,857
This is a disaster!

971
00:51:22,274 --> 00:51:24,026
We gotta fix this. Right now.

972
00:51:24,193 --> 00:51:26,445
- Okay. How?
- We gotta go see Dez.

973
00:51:26,612 --> 00:51:28,531
Great. Who's Dez?

974
00:51:28,698 --> 00:51:30,032
Yo, Ian, man, how you get

975
00:51:30,117 --> 00:51:31,577
that big peanut head?
What happened to you?

976
00:51:31,743 --> 00:51:34,621
Man, shut up, man.
You know I'm sensitive about that.

977
00:51:34,788 --> 00:51:36,165
Dez is the guy in the back.

978
00:51:36,248 --> 00:51:37,292
He can fix this.

979
00:51:37,458 --> 00:51:38,793
Talk about havin' a spark.

980
00:51:38,877 --> 00:51:40,420
This guy was born to be a barber.

981
00:51:40,628 --> 00:51:43,214
But I can't pass for you
in front of all your friends.

982
00:51:43,381 --> 00:51:44,925
Dez is the only one that I talk to.

983
00:51:45,009 --> 00:51:46,427
We usually talk about jazz,

984
00:51:46,594 --> 00:51:49,388
but this time, just sit there,
get the cut, and get out.

985
00:51:53,059 --> 00:51:54,936
Hey, Joe. What are you
doing here on a weekday?

986
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:57,147
You didn't call for an appointment, man.
It's gonna be a while.

987
00:51:57,522 --> 00:52:00,067
Ah, I was afraid of this.
Go ahead and sit down.

988
00:52:00,526 --> 00:52:02,111
Oh, my Lord.

989
00:52:02,195 --> 00:52:03,529
You gotta wait, son.
This is an emergency.

990
00:52:03,696 --> 00:52:04,990
What? That ain't cool, Dez.

991
00:52:05,157 --> 00:52:06,450
You could always let Harold cut your hair.

992
00:52:06,533 --> 00:52:07,910
His chair's wide open.

993
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:09,995
Nah. I can wait.

994
00:52:10,162 --> 00:52:12,332
Joe, get your butt in this chair now.

995
00:52:15,126 --> 00:52:16,669
Should I even ask you how this happened?

996
00:52:16,836 --> 00:52:18,589
- The cat did it.
- Stop sounding insane.

997
00:52:18,756 --> 00:52:20,716
I mean, um, I was distracted

998
00:52:20,799 --> 00:52:22,551
getting ready to play with
Dorothea Williams tonight.

999
00:52:22,718 --> 00:52:25,179
Dorothea Williams?
That's big time, Joe.

1000
00:52:25,263 --> 00:52:27,140
Congratulations!

1001
00:52:27,307 --> 00:52:29,142
Joe ain't getting no gig, Dez.

1002
00:52:29,226 --> 00:52:31,436
You know he Mr Close-But-No-Cigar.

1003
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,730
This guy.

1004
00:52:32,813 --> 00:52:34,690
Joe, ignore him.
Now let's fix you up.

1005
00:52:35,066 --> 00:52:36,275
You keeping that cat on your lap?

1006
00:52:36,442 --> 00:52:37,652
Is it okay that I do that?

1007
00:52:37,818 --> 00:52:39,905
Suit yourself. You're the boss.

1008
00:52:40,447 --> 00:52:41,782
- I am?
- When you're in this chair,

1009
00:52:41,865 --> 00:52:42,950
yeah, you are.

1010
00:52:43,158 --> 00:52:44,993
So can I have one of those?

1011
00:52:46,287 --> 00:52:47,789
Uh... Sure, Joe.

1012
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:51,793
Cool.

1013
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:55,965
Mmm. I like being in the chair.

1014
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:57,424
Hey, get your head in the game.

1015
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:58,592
Little chainsaw.

1016
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,178
You need to settle down.
If you keep this...

1017
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:04,266
Look, I can deal with some freaky stuff,

1018
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:05,851
but if this cat don't chill,

1019
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:07,311
we're gonna have to put it outside.

1020
00:53:07,478 --> 00:53:09,438
Well, what's it gonna be, kitty?

1021
00:53:09,981 --> 00:53:11,190
Meow.

1022
00:53:11,357 --> 00:53:12,984
Sometimes, change is good.

1023
00:53:13,067 --> 00:53:15,237
You have been rocking
that same style for a while.

1024
00:53:15,404 --> 00:53:18,490
Well, Dez, for hundreds of years,
I've had no style at all.

1025
00:53:18,657 --> 00:53:21,035
You can say that again.

1026
00:53:21,995 --> 00:53:23,496
Mmm. But then my life changed.

1027
00:53:23,663 --> 00:53:24,706
Oh, yeah? What happened?

1028
00:53:24,873 --> 00:53:26,916
I was existing as a theoretical construct

1029
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,377
in a hypothetical way station

1030
00:53:28,544 --> 00:53:29,587
between life and death.

1031
00:53:29,753 --> 00:53:30,754
I heard that.

1032
00:53:31,422 --> 00:53:34,049
And by the time
I got to mentor number 266,

1033
00:53:34,217 --> 00:53:37,220
I was seriously asking, like,
what is all the fuss about?

1034
00:53:37,387 --> 00:53:40,473
Like, is all this living
really worth dying for?

1035
00:53:40,557 --> 00:53:42,185
You know what I mean?

1036
00:53:43,394 --> 00:53:46,689
I never knew you had
such an interesting education, Joe.

1037
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,692
I just thought you went to music school.

1038
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:51,653
And another thing,
they say you're born to do something,

1039
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,363
but how do you figure out
what that thing is?

1040
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,450
I mean, what if you pick up
the wrong thing?

1041
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:56,868
Or somebody else's thing, you know?

1042
00:53:57,035 --> 00:53:58,745
- Then you're stuck.
- Been there before.

1043
00:53:59,037 --> 00:54:00,288
I'll take one of those.

1044
00:54:00,455 --> 00:54:01,957
I wouldn't call myself stuck,

1045
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:04,001
but I never planned on
cuttin' heads for a livin'.

1046
00:54:04,168 --> 00:54:06,921
Wait, but you were born to be a barber,
weren't you?

1047
00:54:07,087 --> 00:54:08,422
I wanted to be a veterinarian.

1048
00:54:09,049 --> 00:54:11,009
So, why didn't you do that?

1049
00:54:11,218 --> 00:54:13,303
I was plannin' to
when I got out of the Navy.

1050
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:15,305
Then my daughter got sick,

1051
00:54:15,388 --> 00:54:16,849
and barber school
is a lot cheaper

1052
00:54:16,933 --> 00:54:17,934
than veterinarian school.

1053
00:54:18,017 --> 00:54:19,060
Well, that's too bad.

1054
00:54:19,143 --> 00:54:20,978
You're stuck as a barber
and now you're unhappy.

1055
00:54:21,062 --> 00:54:22,856
Whoa, whoa, slow your roll there, Joe.

1056
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:24,274
I'm happy as a clam, my man.

1057
00:54:24,441 --> 00:54:27,402
Not everyone can be Charles Drew
inventing blood transfusions.

1058
00:54:27,569 --> 00:54:29,697
Or me, playing piano
with Dorothea Williams.

1059
00:54:29,781 --> 00:54:30,782
I know.

1060
00:54:30,865 --> 00:54:32,408
You are not all that.

1061
00:54:32,492 --> 00:54:34,077
Anyone could play in a band
if they wanted to.

1062
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:35,453
Don't pay Paul any mind.

1063
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,581
People like him just bring
other people down

1064
00:54:37,665 --> 00:54:39,458
so they can make themselves feel better.

1065
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:41,126
Oh, I get it.

1066
00:54:41,293 --> 00:54:44,214
He's just criticising me to cover up
the pain of his own failed dreams.

1067
00:54:46,258 --> 00:54:47,968
You cut deep, Joe.

1068
00:54:48,301 --> 00:54:51,305
I wonder why sitting in this chair
makes me want to tell you things, Dez.

1069
00:54:51,472 --> 00:54:54,684
That's the magic of the chair.
That's why I love this job.

1070
00:54:54,851 --> 00:54:57,104
I get to meet interesting folks like you,

1071
00:54:57,187 --> 00:55:00,315
make them happy, and make them handsome.

1072
00:55:00,482 --> 00:55:02,901
Wow! Am I crazy or do I look younger?

1073
00:55:03,068 --> 00:55:05,154
I may not have invented
blood transfusions,

1074
00:55:05,238 --> 00:55:08,741
but I am most definitely savin' lives.

1075
00:55:09,284 --> 00:55:12,037
I don't know about
this crazy cat guy thing, man,

1076
00:55:12,204 --> 00:55:16,125
but it is nice to finally talk to you
about something other than jazz, Joe.

1077
00:55:16,208 --> 00:55:19,296
Huh. How come we, um, never
talked about your life before?

1078
00:55:19,462 --> 00:55:20,839
You never asked.

1079
00:55:20,922 --> 00:55:22,382
But I'm glad you did this time.

1080
00:55:22,549 --> 00:55:24,552
- Looking good, brother.
- Have a great show.

1081
00:55:24,802 --> 00:55:27,346
I grabbed
a couple of road lollies.

1082
00:55:32,728 --> 00:55:34,771
<i>Dr Charma, call 3-1-6-2.</i>

1083
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:39,527
Mm.

1084
00:55:41,905 --> 00:55:43,072
Mm-hmm.

1085
00:55:51,332 --> 00:55:52,334
Mm.

1086
00:55:56,963 --> 00:55:58,256
Oh.

1087
00:56:00,343 --> 00:56:02,637
Julia Child didn't succeed
till she was 49.

1088
00:56:02,803 --> 00:56:04,722
Hey, Paul. Here, have a lollipop.

1089
00:56:04,889 --> 00:56:06,808
Oh, yeah, thanks.
Thanks, man.

1090
00:56:06,975 --> 00:56:08,310
There you are.

1091
00:56:09,394 --> 00:56:11,063
No hard feelings, right? All right.

1092
00:56:11,146 --> 00:56:12,147
Just friends.

1093
00:56:12,231 --> 00:56:13,441
Just friends goofing on each other.
All right.

1094
00:56:14,067 --> 00:56:15,443
Okay. Goodbye, Paul.

1095
00:56:16,194 --> 00:56:17,278
Come to Terry.

1096
00:56:18,821 --> 00:56:19,949
Gotcha!

1097
00:56:21,116 --> 00:56:22,576
Thought you could cheat the universe?

1098
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,661
Well, you thought wrong.

1099
00:56:23,744 --> 00:56:26,038
I'm the accountant,
and I'm here to bring you in...

1100
00:56:26,121 --> 00:56:28,708
Oh, whoa...
You're not Joe Gardner.

1101
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,044
My mistake.

1102
00:56:31,127 --> 00:56:34,173
We'll just get you back into
your meat suit.

1103
00:56:35,633 --> 00:56:36,968
There you go.

1104
00:56:37,051 --> 00:56:38,553
No harm, no foul.

1105
00:56:39,345 --> 00:56:41,515
Oh, boy. Look, uh, fella,

1106
00:56:41,682 --> 00:56:42,975
I'm thinking there's no reason

1107
00:56:43,058 --> 00:56:45,143
we can't keep this little
incident between us, eh?

1108
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:47,814
Mistakes happen.
And, uh, it's not your time.

1109
00:56:47,981 --> 00:56:49,315
Unless you keep eating

1110
00:56:49,399 --> 00:56:51,943
those processed foods,
am I right?

1111
00:56:55,072 --> 00:56:58,075
But seriously, stay away
from those processed foods.

1112
00:57:02,831 --> 00:57:04,291
You know what,
you did all right back there.

1113
00:57:04,374 --> 00:57:05,625
How did you know how to deal with Paul?

1114
00:57:05,792 --> 00:57:07,419
I didn't. I just let out the me.

1115
00:57:07,586 --> 00:57:10,798
Hey, like you said about jazz.
I was jazzing.

1116
00:57:10,882 --> 00:57:13,009
First of all,
"jazzing" is not a word.

1117
00:57:13,175 --> 00:57:16,471
And second, music and life
operate by very different rules.

1118
00:57:16,638 --> 00:57:17,764
It says take one.

1119
00:57:17,931 --> 00:57:20,309
Don't... Or do. Okay. Fine.

1120
00:57:20,475 --> 00:57:21,811
"Man with a van."

1121
00:57:21,895 --> 00:57:23,563
I got a few in case we need a lot of vans.

1122
00:57:24,147 --> 00:57:25,648
Uh-huh. Now, let's get back to the plan.

1123
00:57:25,815 --> 00:57:28,276
We go to The Half Note
and wait there for Moonwind.

1124
00:57:28,443 --> 00:57:29,778
It's around 4:00 p.m. now...

1125
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:32,615
You know what?

1126
00:57:32,698 --> 00:57:33,949
You are really getting good
at using those legs.

1127
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,952
Why don't you try runnin'?

1128
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:38,622
Hey! I made a song.
I'm jazzing.

1129
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,874
Okay, enough of the jazzing
and everything like that.

1130
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,418
We need to get somewhere.
Now, I...

1131
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:44,921
- That tickles.
- Uh, what are you doing?

1132
00:57:52,012 --> 00:57:53,555
Whoops. I got it.

1133
00:57:56,893 --> 00:57:57,977
Would you hurry up?

1134
00:57:58,144 --> 00:57:59,312
Okay.

1135
00:58:01,064 --> 00:58:03,067
You were right.
These pants are loosening.

1136
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,902
Oh, no, no, no.

1137
00:58:04,985 --> 00:58:06,237
Don't let people see your butt!

1138
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,447
- It's your butt.
- It doesn't matter whose butt...

1139
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:10,242
Take off the jacket.
Tie it around your waist.

1140
00:58:10,408 --> 00:58:12,160
Quick! Cover the butt!

1141
00:58:12,327 --> 00:58:13,662
What are we gonna do?

1142
00:58:13,828 --> 00:58:15,538
I can't find a tailor this late...

1143
00:58:16,706 --> 00:58:18,292
Oh, no. We're gonna have to go to Mom's.

1144
00:58:18,376 --> 00:58:19,377
Okay.

1145
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:20,544
No, no, no, you don't understand.

1146
00:58:20,628 --> 00:58:21,671
Mom doesn't know about this gig.

1147
00:58:21,754 --> 00:58:22,755
And she's not gonna like it.

1148
00:58:22,838 --> 00:58:23,840
Okay.

1149
00:58:23,924 --> 00:58:24,967
We don't have any other choice.

1150
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:26,051
Okay.

1151
00:58:26,134 --> 00:58:27,719
She's the only one that can fix this.

1152
00:58:27,886 --> 00:58:29,388
- Okay.
- Stop saying "okay"!

1153
00:58:29,555 --> 00:58:31,558
We gotta catch the subway across town.
Come on.

1154
00:58:31,724 --> 00:58:33,685
Okay... Got it.

1155
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:37,355
My mom doesn't know
anything about the gig,

1156
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,774
and I wanna keep it that way, okay?

1157
00:58:38,941 --> 00:58:40,317
Right, because she thinks
you're a failure.

1158
00:58:40,401 --> 00:58:41,694
- What?
- I didn't say that.

1159
00:58:41,777 --> 00:58:43,028
You did. Up here.

1160
00:58:43,195 --> 00:58:45,532
Uh, look, my mom has her own
definition of what success is,

1161
00:58:45,699 --> 00:58:47,951
and being a professional musician
isn't it.

1162
00:58:48,118 --> 00:58:53,124
So, let me see, I need the suit fixed
for a, uh, school band recital.

1163
00:58:53,207 --> 00:58:56,752
I'm not looking forward to this,
but there's no reason she needs to know...

- Does what?
- It wears you down.

1191
01:00:11,129 --> 01:00:13,423
It stinks. It's hot. It's crowded.

1192
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:16,844
Every day the same thing,
day in and day out.

1193
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:19,681
But once I get on the stage tonight,

1194
01:00:19,764 --> 01:00:21,642
all my troubles are going to be fixed.

1195
01:00:21,809 --> 01:00:24,311
You're gonna see a brand-new Joe Gardner.

1196
01:00:27,439 --> 01:00:28,441
Where'd you get that?

1197
01:00:28,608 --> 01:00:30,068
Under the seat.
Can you believe it?

1198
01:00:30,151 --> 01:00:32,237
It's still half-full.

1199
01:00:33,822 --> 01:00:35,658
All right, remember,

1200
01:00:35,741 --> 01:00:38,786
I need the suit fixed for a band recital.
Got it?

1201
01:00:42,291 --> 01:00:45,252
- Joey! Oh, baby boy...
- Joey!

1202
01:00:45,335 --> 01:00:47,421
- Oh, I'm so proud of you.
- ...we heard the news.

1203
01:00:49,799 --> 01:00:50,800
Oh, crap. She knows.

1204
01:00:50,967 --> 01:00:52,510
Your momma's in the back.

1205
01:00:52,677 --> 01:00:54,304
- You gotta go in there.
- No, I don't want to.

1206
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:56,807
You have to.
We need the suit fixed.

1207
01:00:59,143 --> 01:01:01,020
You forgetting something, Joey?

1208
01:01:01,186 --> 01:01:02,230
- What?
- Kiss her.

1209
01:01:02,439 --> 01:01:04,566
I always kiss Melba when I see her.

1210
01:01:06,901 --> 01:01:08,320
Just do it.

1211
01:01:12,325 --> 01:01:13,951
No, no, no. Not on the lips.

1212
01:01:14,035 --> 01:01:16,079
Joey!
What has gotten into you, boy?

1213
01:01:16,163 --> 01:01:17,205
Let him finish.

1214
01:01:17,289 --> 01:01:18,373
Cougar. I knew it.

1215
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:21,460
I'll take another kiss
when you get back, Joey.

1216
01:01:26,007 --> 01:01:29,010
So much for being done
chasing after gigs, huh?

1217
01:01:29,344 --> 01:01:32,765
I hope that cat isn't supposed to be
some kind of peace offering.

1218
01:01:32,932 --> 01:01:34,141
Come. Come on.

1219
01:01:34,308 --> 01:01:35,392
Just say you rescued it.

1220
01:01:35,476 --> 01:01:37,854
Um, no. It's mine. I rescued it.

1221
01:01:37,938 --> 01:01:40,231
Hmm. Too bad you can't rescue your career.

1222
01:01:40,315 --> 01:01:41,399
Oh.

1223
01:01:41,483 --> 01:01:44,612
Just ask her nicely
if she can fix my suit.

1224
01:01:44,779 --> 01:01:48,449
So, Mom, is there any way
you can fix this?

1225
01:01:48,532 --> 01:01:49,992
Whoa! I don't need to see that.

1226
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:52,204
I know. Embarrassing, right?

1227
01:01:52,371 --> 01:01:53,872
So, you'll fix it?

1228
01:01:54,039 --> 01:01:55,165
- No.
- What?

1229
01:01:55,249 --> 01:01:57,543
How long are you going
to keep doing this, Joey?

1230
01:01:57,627 --> 01:01:59,837
You tell me you're going
to accept the full-time position...

1231
01:01:59,921 --> 01:02:00,922
Here it comes.

1232
01:02:01,005 --> 01:02:02,298
...and instead,
I hear you've taken another gig.

1233
01:02:02,382 --> 01:02:03,508
Tell her that this one is different.

1234
01:02:03,591 --> 01:02:04,593
This one's different!

1235
01:02:04,677 --> 01:02:06,929
Does this gig have a pension?
Health insurance?

1236
01:02:07,304 --> 01:02:09,974
No? Then it's the same as the other ones.

1237
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,060
It's like you can't even
be truthful with me anymore.

1238
01:02:12,227 --> 01:02:14,187
Fine, we'll get the suit
off the rack somewhere.

1239
01:02:14,354 --> 01:02:17,232
My mom has never understood
what I'm trying to do with my life.

1240
01:02:17,315 --> 01:02:18,943
Fine, we'll get the suit
off the rack somewhere.

1241
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:20,695
My mom has never understood

1242
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:21,862
what I'm trying to do with my life.

1243
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:23,864
- 22!
- What did you just say?

1244
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:26,201
Oof. Can I run away now,
like you usually do?

1245
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:31,665
No. Not this time.
Repeat after me.

1246
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:34,586
Mom, I know we've had some rough times,

1247
01:02:35,044 --> 01:02:36,588
but you're right,

1248
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:39,341
I can't be truthful with you.

1249
01:02:39,508 --> 01:02:42,344
Because it seems like
no matter what I do, you disapprove.

1250
01:02:42,511 --> 01:02:44,555
Look, I know you love playing.

1251
01:02:44,722 --> 01:02:47,726
Then how come except for church,
you're the happiest when I don't?

1252
01:02:47,892 --> 01:02:51,104
I finally land the gig of my life
and you're upset.

1253
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:54,066
You didn't see how tough
being a musician was on your father.

1254
01:02:54,233 --> 01:02:56,068
I don't want to see
you struggle like that.

1255
01:02:56,235 --> 01:02:58,321
So Dad could pursue his dreams,
and I can't?

1256
01:02:58,487 --> 01:03:00,365
Your father had me.

1257
01:03:00,532 --> 01:03:03,368
Most times,
this shop is what paid the bills.

1258
01:03:03,535 --> 01:03:06,079
So when I'm gone, who's gonna pay yours?

1259
01:03:06,247 --> 01:03:07,707
Music is all I think about.

1260
01:03:07,874 --> 01:03:09,959
From the moment I wake up in the morning

1261
01:03:10,043 --> 01:03:12,086
to the moment I fall asleep at night.

1262
01:03:12,253 --> 01:03:14,506
You can't eat dreams for breakfast, Joey.

1263
01:03:14,673 --> 01:03:16,050
Then I don't want to eat.

1264
01:03:16,216 --> 01:03:19,053
This isn't about my career, Mom.

1265
01:03:19,261 --> 01:03:21,389
It's my reason for living.

1266
01:03:21,473 --> 01:03:23,308
And I know Dad felt the same way.

1267
01:03:24,225 --> 01:03:27,521
I'm just afraid
that if I died today,

1268
01:03:28,064 --> 01:03:31,108
that my life would've amounted to nothing.

1269
01:03:33,319 --> 01:03:34,529
Joey.

1270
01:03:41,746 --> 01:03:42,747
Oh.

1271
01:03:48,963 --> 01:03:51,924
Let's make this work instead.

1272
01:03:55,887 --> 01:03:57,389
That's my dad's suit.

1273
01:03:57,555 --> 01:03:58,765
Lulu. Melba.

1274
01:03:58,848 --> 01:04:01,394
Bring your good scissors in here.
We got work to do.

1275
01:04:06,565 --> 01:04:08,485
Wow. This feels really nice.

1276
01:04:08,652 --> 01:04:10,946
- You look marvellous.
- It fits perfectly.

1277
01:04:11,029 --> 01:04:12,030
You see how I did that?

1278
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:15,326
That is one fine wool suit,
if I do say so myself.

1279
01:04:15,493 --> 01:04:16,703
- Can I try on that?
- Of course you can.

1280
01:04:16,869 --> 01:04:18,830
Just handsome.

1281
01:04:18,997 --> 01:04:21,582
Thank you, uh, Mom.

1282
01:04:21,749 --> 01:04:24,378
Ray would have been so proud of you, baby.

1283
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,922
Like I've always been.

1284
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:29,759
You heard me, right?

1285
01:04:29,843 --> 01:04:32,095
The suit is wool, not polyester.

1286
01:04:32,262 --> 01:04:34,431
So, don't go putting that cat
on your shoulders again.

1287
01:04:34,514 --> 01:04:35,515
Yes, ma'am!

1288
01:04:35,598 --> 01:04:36,892
Oh,
there's a nice little taper there.

1289
01:04:37,059 --> 01:04:38,269
Thanks, Mom.

1290
01:04:40,938 --> 01:04:42,273
Oh, that was amazin'.

1291
01:04:42,356 --> 01:04:44,192
You know what that felt like?
It felt like jazz.

1292
01:04:44,359 --> 01:04:45,777
Yeah, you were jazzing.

1293
01:04:45,944 --> 01:04:47,696
Ha-ha. Okay, jazzing.

1294
01:04:49,489 --> 01:04:50,533
I'm telling you, Joe.

1295
01:04:50,617 --> 01:04:52,160
You really should call Lisa again.

1296
01:04:52,327 --> 01:04:55,038
I don't really have time
for a relationship right now, 22.

1297
01:04:55,204 --> 01:04:56,582
Oh, busy right now?

1298
01:04:56,665 --> 01:04:58,000
Wanna wait till you die a second time?

1299
01:04:58,167 --> 01:04:59,335
Cool, cool, cool.

1300
01:04:59,501 --> 01:05:01,128
I can't believe
I'm getting romantic advice

1301
01:05:01,211 --> 01:05:02,296
from an unborn soul.

1302
01:05:02,379 --> 01:05:04,007
I can think of worse.

1303
01:05:04,174 --> 01:05:05,383
There it is.

1304
01:05:06,509 --> 01:05:11,265
We made it!
This is going to work.

1305
01:05:11,349 --> 01:05:13,559
Whoa! I can't believe how good I look.

1306
01:05:13,726 --> 01:05:16,562
The suit, the cut.
Just look at me.

1307
01:05:22,444 --> 01:05:24,572
- Ooh, just turn a little bit right there.
- Like this?

1308
01:05:24,656 --> 01:05:26,741
- Angle the shoulders, and...
- Oh, hey, who's that?

1309
01:05:26,824 --> 01:05:27,867
- And from this side.
- That's it.

1310
01:05:27,951 --> 01:05:28,993
What? Who's back here?

1311
01:05:29,077 --> 01:05:30,662
- Still me. Uh-huh.
- That's a winner.

1312
01:05:30,745 --> 01:05:32,957
Right?

1313
01:05:33,999 --> 01:05:35,960
This can't be happenin'.
Now, I'm not gonna believe this.

1314
01:05:36,126 --> 01:05:37,753
The Half Note.

1315
01:05:41,925 --> 01:05:44,427
He made you pay for dinner?

1316
01:05:44,511 --> 01:05:45,554
Yeah...

1317
01:06:07,162 --> 01:06:08,914
- So, you ready?
- Huh?

1318
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:10,207
To go home.

1319
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:12,711
I bet you're ready to get off
of this stinky rock, huh?

1320
01:06:12,877 --> 01:06:14,754
What do you think of Earth, anyway?

1321
01:06:19,134 --> 01:06:21,637
I always said it was dumb. But...

1322
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:24,265
I mean...

1323
01:06:24,765 --> 01:06:26,685
Just look at what I found.

1324
01:06:27,561 --> 01:06:30,605
Your mom sewed your suit
from this cute spool.

1325
01:06:31,148 --> 01:06:33,693
When I was nervous, Dez gave me this.

1326
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:37,071
A guy on the subway yelled at me.
It was scary.

1327
01:06:37,655 --> 01:06:40,576
But I kind of liked that, too.

1328
01:06:44,455 --> 01:06:45,914
Truth is, I've always worried

1329
01:06:45,998 --> 01:06:48,710
that maybe there's something
wrong with me. You know?

1330
01:06:49,628 --> 01:06:51,921
Maybe I'm not good enough for living.

1331
01:06:52,922 --> 01:06:59,180
But then you showed me
about purpose and passion,

1332
01:06:59,263 --> 01:07:01,433
and maybe sky-watching can be my spark.

1333
01:07:01,516 --> 01:07:03,602
Or walking.
I'm really good at walking.

1334
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,479
Those really aren't purposes, 22.

1335
01:07:05,562 --> 01:07:06,855
That's just regular old living.

1336
01:07:07,022 --> 01:07:09,025
But, hey, when you get back
to the You Seminar,

1337
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:10,568
you can give it an honest try.

1338
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:13,321
No, but I've been at the You Seminar
for thousands of years

1339
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:15,574
and I have never felt this close.

1340
01:07:15,741 --> 01:07:18,702
Joe! Who's ready to go home?

1341
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:19,870
Moonwind.

1342
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:20,996
The stars are almost in alignment.

1343
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:22,082
All right.

1344
01:07:22,165 --> 01:07:23,375
I'll have you back
in your bodies in no time.

1345
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:27,045
No. I've gotta find it here, on Earth.

1346
01:07:27,128 --> 01:07:29,173
This is my only chance to find my spark.

1347
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:32,885
22, you're only loving this stuff
because you're in my body.

1348
01:07:33,052 --> 01:07:36,348
You can find your own thing to love
when you get back to the You Seminar.

1349
01:07:36,515 --> 01:07:38,767
Now, come on,
I need my body back. Now!

1350
01:07:41,436 --> 01:07:42,438
No.

1351
01:07:44,482 --> 01:07:46,025
I'm in the chair.

1352
01:07:48,152 --> 01:07:49,863
- 22!
- Leave me alone!

1353
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:52,074
I'm trying to find my purpose!

1354
01:07:52,241 --> 01:07:53,909
22, you come back here!

1355
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,622
22!

1356
01:08:05,131 --> 01:08:06,215
Mr Mittens.

1357
01:08:06,299 --> 01:08:08,175
Oh.

1358
01:08:13,932 --> 01:08:15,309
{\An8}TERRY: There they are.

1359
01:08:21,941 --> 01:08:23,234
You come back here right now!

1360
01:08:25,404 --> 01:08:26,947
You stole my body!

1361
01:08:53,811 --> 01:08:56,314
It's your time to go, Joe Gardner.

1362
01:09:03,197 --> 01:09:04,198
Oh, no, you don't.

1363
01:09:06,951 --> 01:09:07,952
Gotcha!

1364
01:09:09,621 --> 01:09:11,164
No, no, no.

1365
01:09:21,051 --> 01:09:23,428
No, no!

1366
01:09:24,971 --> 01:09:27,016
I was gonna play with Dorothea Williams!

1367
01:09:27,183 --> 01:09:28,935
And I was about to find my spark!

1368
01:09:29,102 --> 01:09:30,436
Find your spark?
My life was finally going to change!

1369
01:09:30,603 --> 01:09:31,854
You promised, but you wouldn't
even give me five minutes!

1370
01:09:32,021 --> 01:09:33,148
I lost everything because of you!

1371
01:09:33,232 --> 01:09:34,233
Joe!

1372
01:09:35,484 --> 01:09:37,069
You cheated.

1373
01:09:42,492 --> 01:09:43,827
Found him.

1374
01:09:43,994 --> 01:09:45,245
- Joe Gardner.
- You're back!

1375
01:09:45,328 --> 01:09:46,372
Terry, you found them.

1376
01:09:46,455 --> 01:09:47,456
No need to thank me.

1377
01:09:47,623 --> 01:09:50,126
It's so nice to have
everything back in order, and...

1378
01:09:51,002 --> 01:09:53,213
22 got her pass?

1379
01:09:55,507 --> 01:09:57,092
- Oh, my goodness.
- 22! You got an Earth Pass!

1380
01:09:57,175 --> 01:09:58,635
This is amazing!

1381
01:09:58,802 --> 01:10:00,096
I knew you could do it.

1382
01:10:00,179 --> 01:10:01,222
This is cray cray.

1383
01:10:01,389 --> 01:10:04,142
But what...
What filled in the last box?

1384
01:10:04,308 --> 01:10:06,687
I'll tell you what filled it in. I did!

1385
01:10:06,854 --> 01:10:08,605
It was my spark that changed that badge.

1386
01:10:08,772 --> 01:10:12,276
She only got that because
she was living my life in my body.

1387
01:10:12,443 --> 01:10:14,654
- I was...
- Come on, Mr Gardner.

1388
01:10:16,156 --> 01:10:17,407
Joe, it's time for you

1389
01:10:17,490 --> 01:10:19,242
to accompany 22 to the Earth portal.

1390
01:10:19,409 --> 01:10:20,911
Give you a chance to say goodbye.

1391
01:10:21,078 --> 01:10:22,705
Of course.
It's standard procedure.

1392
01:10:22,872 --> 01:10:25,624
Just hold on a minute.
I get to set the count right.

1393
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:28,378
Terry, you have done a super job.

1394
01:10:28,462 --> 01:10:29,504
We'll take it from here.

1395
01:10:29,588 --> 01:10:30,589
You're amazing.

1396
01:10:31,465 --> 01:10:32,632
Well, thank you.

1397
01:10:33,633 --> 01:10:35,303
Terrytime.

1398
01:10:35,803 --> 01:10:37,638
Go ahead, you two.

1399
01:10:47,691 --> 01:10:48,693
You don't know.

1400
01:10:50,236 --> 01:10:52,405
You can't be sure why my pass changed.

1401
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:54,574
Come on, 22.
Think about it.

1402
01:10:54,741 --> 01:10:57,620
You hated music until you were in my body.

1403
01:10:57,787 --> 01:11:01,290
You hated everything until you were me.

1404
01:11:04,461 --> 01:11:05,796
I hope you enjoy it.

1405
01:11:22,857 --> 01:11:23,942
Uh...

1406
01:11:26,194 --> 01:11:28,405
I have to ask,
how the Dickens did you do it?

1407
01:11:28,571 --> 01:11:30,074
Get that Earth Pass to change?

1408
01:11:30,157 --> 01:11:32,785
Oh. You know what, I...
I just let her walk

1409
01:11:32,868 --> 01:11:34,537
a mile in my shoes, you could say.

1410
01:11:34,745 --> 01:11:35,997
Well, it worked.

1411
01:11:36,623 --> 01:11:37,708
Yeah.

1412
01:11:37,874 --> 01:11:40,627
Well, you should probably
get going to the Great Beyond.

1413
01:11:40,794 --> 01:11:43,464
Hey, um, we never found out
what 22's purpose was.

1414
01:11:44,007 --> 01:11:46,092
- Excuse me?
- You know, her, uh, spark.

1415
01:11:46,259 --> 01:11:49,929
Her purpose. Was it music?
Biology? Walking?

1416
01:11:50,097 --> 01:11:52,433
We don't assign purposes.
Where did you get that idea?

1417
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,143
Because I have piano.

1418
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:56,270
It's what I was born to do.
That's my spark.

1419
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:58,690
A spark isn't a soul's purpose.

1420
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,401
Oh, you mentors and your passions.

1421
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:05,990
Your purposes. Your meanings of life.
So basic.

1422
01:12:06,073 --> 01:12:08,200
No, no, it...

1423
01:12:11,997 --> 01:12:13,206
Wow.

1424
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:16,460
It is music.
My spark is music. I...

1425
01:12:17,169 --> 01:12:18,588
I know it is.

1426
01:12:24,553 --> 01:12:25,554
I'm no good.

1427
01:12:26,388 --> 01:12:28,098
I got no purpose.

1428
01:12:29,308 --> 01:12:30,642
No purpose.

1429
01:12:31,352 --> 01:12:33,355
No purpose.

1430
01:13:02,221 --> 01:13:04,390
Mr G?

1431
01:13:04,473 --> 01:13:06,059
Curley, I made it.
I'm ready to go.

1432
01:13:06,226 --> 01:13:07,394
You're too late, man.

1433
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,603
Let me talk to Dorothea.

1434
01:13:08,687 --> 01:13:10,897
No, no, no, man.
She don't play that.

1435
01:13:11,106 --> 01:13:14,360
These rappers act like...
Who let this lunatic in here?

1436
01:13:14,527 --> 01:13:16,445
Listen, you gotta give me another chance.

1437
01:13:16,654 --> 01:13:19,657
This is my band.
I decide who plays.

1438
01:13:19,825 --> 01:13:21,535
And if you don't go with me,

1439
01:13:21,618 --> 01:13:23,995
you'll be making the biggest
mistake of your career.

1440
01:13:24,579 --> 01:13:27,083
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

1441
01:13:27,542 --> 01:13:30,545
My only purpose on this planet is to play.

1442
01:13:30,712 --> 01:13:33,966
It's what I was meant to do.
And nothing's gonna stop me.

1443
01:13:38,053 --> 01:13:40,932
Well, aren't you an arrogant one?

1444
01:13:41,099 --> 01:13:44,019
I guess you really are a jazz player.

1445
01:13:44,185 --> 01:13:47,230
Tell Robert he's out. For now.

1446
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:49,692
Nice suit.

1447
01:13:59,578 --> 01:14:03,416
Get ready, Joe Gardner,
your life is about to start.

1448
01:15:20,504 --> 01:15:22,631
Welcome to the quartet, Teach.

1449
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:28,847
That's my Joey!

1450
01:15:33,853 --> 01:15:35,646
- What a show!
- That last solo was brilliant.

1451
01:15:35,813 --> 01:15:36,814
That was amazing!

1452
01:15:36,981 --> 01:15:38,316
I'm not gonna cover
that bridge for you again.

1453
01:15:38,483 --> 01:15:40,068
- Whoo! Later, Mr G.
- Congratulations.

1454
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:41,945
You did great. We love you.

1455
01:15:42,028 --> 01:15:43,030
I'm so proud of you, Joey.

1456
01:15:43,155 --> 01:15:45,533
Gotta get to bed. We old.

1457
01:15:48,036 --> 01:15:50,663
You play 100 shows,
and one of them is killer.

1458
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:52,708
You don't get many like tonight.

1459
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:54,168
Yeah.

1460
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:57,546
So, uh, what happens next?

1461
01:15:57,713 --> 01:16:00,967
We come back tomorrow night
and do it all again.

1462
01:16:03,344 --> 01:16:04,763
What's wrong, Teach?

1463
01:16:05,848 --> 01:16:11,145
It's just I've been waiting
on this day for my entire life.

1464
01:16:13,732 --> 01:16:15,609
I thought I'd feel different.

1465
01:16:18,528 --> 01:16:20,907
I heard this story about a fish.

1466
01:16:21,616 --> 01:16:23,868
He swims up to this older fish and says,

1467
01:16:24,035 --> 01:16:26,830
"I'm trying to find this thing
they call the ocean."

1468
01:16:26,997 --> 01:16:29,083
"The ocean?" Says the older fish.

1469
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:30,626
"That's what you're in right now."

1470
01:16:30,793 --> 01:16:34,005
"This?" Says the young fish.
"This is water.

1471
01:16:34,172 --> 01:16:37,092
"What I want is the ocean."

1472
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:41,722
See you tomorrow.

1473
01:16:54,654 --> 01:16:56,572
- Hey, man.
- Sorry.

1474
01:20:27,523 --> 01:20:29,441
<i>Maybe sky-watching can be my spark.</i>

1475
01:20:29,525 --> 01:20:31,860
<i>Or walking.
I'm really good at walking.</i>

1476
01:20:32,027 --> 01:20:33,779
<i>Those really aren't purposes, 22.</i>

1477
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:35,615
<i>That's just regular old living.</i>

1478
01:21:22,335 --> 01:21:23,879
- Joe?
- Huh?

1479
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:25,797
Joe!

1480
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:28,425
Good heavens, man.
What are you doing in the zone?

1481
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:32,054
Moonwind. I messed up.
I need to find 22.

1482
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:35,516
I'm afraid she's become a lost soul.

1483
01:21:35,683 --> 01:21:37,227
- What?
- I'll explain on the way.

1484
01:21:40,189 --> 01:21:41,690
When neither of you returned
to The Half Note,

1485
01:21:41,857 --> 01:21:43,318
I suspected something had gone wrong.

1486
01:21:43,485 --> 01:21:47,447
<i>I came back here,
and that's when I spotted her.</i>

1487
01:21:50,075 --> 01:21:53,996
Lost souls are obsessed by something
that disconnects them from life.

1488
01:21:54,163 --> 01:21:57,417
And now that 22 has technically lived,
she's become one of them.

1489
01:21:57,584 --> 01:21:59,044
- There!
- Good show.

1490
01:22:05,968 --> 01:22:06,969
22!

1491
01:22:10,014 --> 01:22:11,809
- Ready the net.
- I'm on it.

1492
01:22:24,114 --> 01:22:25,241
She's got us!

1493
01:22:28,661 --> 01:22:29,662
Moonwind!

1494
01:22:29,745 --> 01:22:31,373
A captain always
goes down with the ship.

1495
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:32,707
It has been a...

1496
01:22:38,631 --> 01:22:39,632
22!

1497
01:22:41,092 --> 01:22:43,219
Come back, 22. It's me, Joe.

1498
01:22:45,514 --> 01:22:46,723
Easy, 22, easy.

1499
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:50,018
I just came back to give you this.

1500
01:22:52,397 --> 01:22:53,398
Easy.

1501
01:22:55,066 --> 01:22:57,068
22, listen. Come back!

1502
01:23:00,698 --> 01:23:03,367
And for correcting
our absent-minded mistakes

1503
01:23:03,451 --> 01:23:04,535
and setting the count right,

1504
01:23:04,702 --> 01:23:08,832
we are awarding you, Terry, this trophy.
As you requested.

1505
01:23:10,292 --> 01:23:13,671
I am happy to accept this
very special award I requested,

1506
01:23:13,838 --> 01:23:16,466
but that I absolutely deserve.

1507
01:23:19,511 --> 01:23:20,554
Joe Gardner?

1508
01:23:20,637 --> 01:23:21,638
And I'll just take that back.

1509
01:23:21,805 --> 01:23:22,806
Hey.

1510
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:27,729
Oi, noob!
You're not where you belong.

1511
01:23:32,525 --> 01:23:34,153
Uh...

1512
01:23:34,236 --> 01:23:36,030
22, stop.
I have something to tell you.

1513
01:23:37,907 --> 01:23:40,535
Stop that. No.

1514
01:23:43,163 --> 01:23:44,539
22!

1515
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:46,918
Whoa, watch out!

1516
01:23:47,084 --> 01:23:48,252
Take it easy.

1517
01:23:48,336 --> 01:23:49,378
- There, there.
- There's no need to be afraid.

1518
01:23:49,587 --> 01:23:51,714
Don't worry. Calm down.

1519
01:23:51,881 --> 01:23:53,801
You have to stop running. Please.

1520
01:23:53,967 --> 01:23:55,302
22, stop.

1521
01:23:55,552 --> 01:23:56,804
22, I was wrong.

1522
01:23:58,013 --> 01:24:01,810
Please, will you listen?
You are ready to live, 22.

1523
01:24:14,825 --> 01:24:16,785
I'm not good enough. Nope. No.

1524
01:24:17,035 --> 01:24:18,370
Nothing. I just need to
fill out that last box.

1525
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:19,454
22!

1526
01:24:20,539 --> 01:24:21,666
You're dishonest.

1527
01:24:21,749 --> 01:24:23,167
All you make are bad decisions.

1528
01:24:23,334 --> 01:24:25,253
You are unwise and you won't
make it in the world.

1529
01:24:25,336 --> 01:24:26,379
You're so selfish.

1530
01:24:26,462 --> 01:24:27,505
No one would ever want to be around you.

1531
01:24:27,588 --> 01:24:28,715
Loser.

1532
01:24:28,882 --> 01:24:31,051
Oh, the world needs remarkable people

1533
01:24:31,218 --> 01:24:34,138
and you are the least
remarkable soul I've ever met.

1534
01:24:34,429 --> 01:24:36,266
You'll never find your spark.

1535
01:24:36,432 --> 01:24:37,433
Imbecile.

1536
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,144
I cannot help you.

1537
01:24:39,227 --> 01:24:40,270
22!

1538
01:24:40,436 --> 01:24:42,022
I just need to fill out that last box.

1539
01:24:42,189 --> 01:24:43,315
I'm not good enough at all.

1540
01:24:43,607 --> 01:24:45,359
You will never find your spark.

1541
01:24:45,443 --> 01:24:46,819
There's no point.

1542
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:49,448
Those aren't purposes,
you idiot.

1543
01:24:49,531 --> 01:24:51,116
That's just regular old living.

1544
01:24:51,283 --> 01:24:52,742
This is a waste of time.

1545
01:24:52,909 --> 01:24:55,328
You only got that badge
because you were in my body.

1546
01:24:55,495 --> 01:24:57,331
That's why you ruin everything.

1547
01:24:57,498 --> 01:25:00,168
Because you have no purpose.

1548
01:25:05,674 --> 01:25:07,926
No, no, no.

1549
01:25:17,354 --> 01:25:18,814
There's no point.

1550
01:25:18,981 --> 01:25:20,691
You'll never find your spark.

1551
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:24,988
Because you have no purpose!

1552
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:34,749
I'm not good. Nope.

1553
01:25:34,957 --> 01:25:38,170
Nothing. I just need to fill
out that last box. I give up.

1554
01:25:49,808 --> 01:25:50,850
You ready?

1555
01:25:50,934 --> 01:25:51,936
Huh?

1556
01:25:52,436 --> 01:25:53,729
To come live.

1557
01:25:56,273 --> 01:25:57,525
I'm scared, Joe.

1558
01:25:58,777 --> 01:26:00,070
I'm not good enough.

1559
01:26:01,154 --> 01:26:03,824
Anyway, I never got my spark.

1560
01:26:04,199 --> 01:26:05,493
Yes, you did.

1561
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:14,503
Your spark isn't your purpose.

1562
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:18,340
That last box fills in
when you're ready to come live.

1563
01:26:20,093 --> 01:26:21,302
And, the thing is

1564
01:26:22,387 --> 01:26:24,764
you're pretty great at jazzing.

1565
01:26:54,382 --> 01:26:55,383
But, Joe,

1566
01:26:56,092 --> 01:26:57,469
this means you won't get to...

1567
01:26:57,635 --> 01:27:00,514
It's okay. I already did.

1568
01:27:00,681 --> 01:27:02,433
Now it's your turn.

1569
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:09,816
I'll go with you.

1570
01:27:10,317 --> 01:27:11,693
You know you can't do that.

1571
01:27:12,194 --> 01:27:15,114
I know.
But I'll go as far as I can.

1572
01:27:29,923 --> 01:27:31,925
Hey! Take a look!

1573
01:27:40,601 --> 01:27:41,853
Wow!

1574
01:28:54,519 --> 01:28:55,770
Mr Gardner?

1575
01:28:57,315 --> 01:28:58,316
Yes?

1576
01:28:58,399 --> 01:28:59,609
Do you have a moment?

1577
01:29:00,776 --> 01:29:04,281
I think I'm speaking for all the Jerrys
when I say thank you.

1578
01:29:04,698 --> 01:29:05,699
For what?

1579
01:29:05,866 --> 01:29:07,659
We're in the business of inspiration, Joe,

1580
01:29:07,743 --> 01:29:10,454
but it's not often
we find ourselves inspired.

1581
01:29:10,914 --> 01:29:12,415
Huh. Really?

1582
01:29:12,582 --> 01:29:16,127
So, we all decided to give you
another chance.

1583
01:29:20,841 --> 01:29:23,761
Hopefully, you will watch
where you walk from now on.

1584
01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:26,431
But what about Terry?

1585
01:29:26,598 --> 01:29:28,099
We worked it out with Terry.

1586
01:29:30,852 --> 01:29:32,021
Mm. That's weird.

1587
01:29:32,104 --> 01:29:33,231
Hey, Terry, what's that over there?

1588
01:29:33,314 --> 01:29:34,357
Look immediately.

1589
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:35,441
What? What are you talking about?

1590
01:29:35,525 --> 01:29:37,485
- Oh, nothing. You were saying?
- Hmm?

1591
01:29:37,652 --> 01:29:39,404
Were you even talking?
I can't remember.

1592
01:29:39,571 --> 01:29:40,697
Never mind.

1593
01:29:42,282 --> 01:29:43,283
Well?

1594
01:29:49,791 --> 01:29:51,000
Thanks.

1595
01:29:51,125 --> 01:29:53,254
So what do you think you'll do?

1596
01:29:53,462 --> 01:29:55,005
How are you gonna spend your life?

1597
01:29:55,631 --> 01:29:57,216
I'm not sure.

1598
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:02,013
