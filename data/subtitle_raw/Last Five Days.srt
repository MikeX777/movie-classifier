00:00:00,043 --> 00:00:05,215
FIVE LAST DAYS

2
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:20,313
A FILM BY PERCY ADLON

3
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:14,802
On-site prison of the Secret Police
at the Wittelsbacher Palais,

4
00:02:15,512 --> 00:02:17,305
Munich headquarters.

5
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:21,183
Thursday, the 18th of February, 1943.

6
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,478
Day 1.

7
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,402
10 a.m.

8
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,615
Yes?

9
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,200
Yes, sir.

10
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:05,705
Yes?

11
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,502
Yes.

12
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:13,922
Of course.

13
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:15,965
Will do.

14
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:18,885
My pleasure. Heil Hitler.

15
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:23,222
What's going on?
What's wrong?

16
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,017
They caught students leafletting.

17
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,937
They were throwing loads of them down
at the university.

18
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,438
Down from where?

19
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:34,067
From the whatchamacallit upstairs
that goes around.

20
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:36,652
I've never been in there either.

21
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,905
That doesn't mean anything.
It doesn't have to be them.

22
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:43,952
No, but it might be them.

23
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:49,957
11 a.m.

24
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:04,722
Fräulein Else, lunch.

25
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:16,067
They're arresting the students.
- The painters?

26
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,443
New arrivals.

27
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:20,405
They really gave us the runaround.

28
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,907
Not you.

29
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,033
I saw their graffiti.

30
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,660
"Down with Hitler."

31
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,453
"Hitler: Mass Murderer."

32
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,788
"Freedom."

33
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:32,833
That big.

34
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,213
Along Ludwigstraße,
the University.

35
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,507
Crossed-out swastikas.

36
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,468
Well, if they're the ones we caught...

37
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:48,598
12 noon.

38
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,903
Bring him to interrogation!
The young lady to reception.

39
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:28,680
Come, Fräulein.

40
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,568
Have a seat, Fräulein.

41
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,077
I must remind you that you will be liable
to prosecution

42
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:54,082
if you don't answer
the following questions truthfully.

43
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,750
Did you understand that?

44
00:06:58,502 --> 00:06:59,545
Yes.

45
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,255
Of course!

46
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,392
Last name?

47
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,352
Scholl.

48
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:23,110
First name?
- Sophie.

49
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,990
Sophia Magdalena.

50
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:45,382
Date of birth?

51
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,093
May 9th, 1921.

52
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:55,852
21, 22, 23.

53
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,107
You're 22 years old.

54
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:02,858
21.

55
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,318
I would have said younger.

56
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,115
Expose your ear.

57
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:17,290
21, 22, 23.

58
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,877
Place of birth?

59
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,712
Forchtenberg am Kocher.

60
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:33,763
Expose your ear.

61
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:41,688
21, 22, 23.

62
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,275
Where is Forchtenberg?

63
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,735
In Württemberg.

64
00:08:47,487 --> 00:08:48,528
Occupation?

65
00:08:49,322 --> 00:08:51,573
Student. And kindergarten teacher.

66
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:58,705
That's that.

67
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,710
What are you studying?

68
00:09:04,712 --> 00:09:05,880
Biology.

69
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,507
And philosophy.

70
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:11,468
Marital status?
- Single.

71
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,183
Prior convictions?
- No.

72
00:09:18,977 --> 00:09:20,812
No prior convictions...

73
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,778
Let's do that again on the other side now.

74
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,573
Thumb...

75
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,703
Index finger.

76
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:43,458
Middle finger.

77
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:49,173
Ring finger.

78
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,552
And the pinky.

79
00:09:57,348 --> 00:10:01,310
Now, hand over everything
you have on you, Fräulein...

80
00:10:01,477 --> 00:10:03,103
Fräulein Scholl.

81
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:06,648
Fräulein Gebel, take her personal belongings.

82
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,488
Coat pockets.

83
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,303
Coat.

84
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,563
Scarf.

85
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,818
Last name?
- Scholl.

86
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,198
Anything else in your pockets?

87
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:59,077
First name?
- Hans.

88
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,747
You can keep that.

89
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,207
Date of birth?

90
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,918
September 22nd, 1918.

91
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:11,380
Let me see that barrette.

92
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,218
Place of birth?
- Ingersheim.

93
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,645
Perform the body search, Fräulein Gebel.

94
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,563
According to the regulations!

95
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,317
Prior convictions?

96
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:32,527
No.

97
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,487
No prior convictions.

98
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,665
12:30 p.m.

99
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,127
If you want to get rid of something...

100
00:11:50,962 --> 00:11:52,547
A leaflet...

101
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,173
I'm an inmate myself.

102
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,702
You needn't be afraid.

103
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:27,582
I'm not afraid.

104
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:38,175
You can get dressed.

105
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,177
She doesn't have anything.

106
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,493
Yes?

107
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:06,495
Yes, sir.

108
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:08,747
Together.

109
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,582
You're welcome.

110
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,920
Get your things.
I'm putting you with Scholl.

111
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,343
Unlock the large cell.

112
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:07,347
Wait.

113
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,348
The VIP cell!

114
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,143
It's usually for wayward party members.

115
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,312
It won't be so tragic, Fräulein.

116
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,860
I'm sure you'd rather take that one.

117
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:47,280
Thanks.

118
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,380
Have you been here long?
- A year.

119
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:07,508
They caught me a year ago.
On a train.

120
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,387
An inspection.

121
00:16:11,097 --> 00:16:13,848
But they only found a letter

122
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,018
with a quote from Ludwig Thoma in it.

123
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,105
It describes our beloved Führer to a T.

124
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:34,828
How do they treat you here?

125
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,997
Not bad.

126
00:16:37,707 --> 00:16:39,792
I'm a bookkeeper.

127
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,585
They have me working in registration.

128
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:44,630
I find out a lot of things there.

129
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,262
Fräulein, prepare for interrogation.

130
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,015
Wait!

131
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,060
You did nothing, all right?

132
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,395
But they find things everywhere.

133
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,190
Don't admit to anything.

134
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,525
To anything ever!

135
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,490
3 p.m.

136
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,327
Groß, Angelika.
You can go.

137
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,708
Finder, Rainer Xaver.
You can go.

138
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:26,003
Meier, August.
You have to wait.

139
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,257
Kranz, Luise.

140
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,300
Go to interrogation.

141
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,722
Dubois, Herta.
You have to wait.

142
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,683
Molchinger, Max Emanuel.

143
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,477
Go to interrogation.

144
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,855
Wimmer, Susanne.

145
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,565
You have to wait.

146
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,527
Vogel, Sebastian. You can go.

147
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,862
I'm sure Fräulein Scholl didn't do anything.

148
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:53,240
I'll eat my hat if she did!

149
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:57,493
It's possible.
She didn't get the good cell for nothing.

150
00:17:58,537 --> 00:18:00,705
Here's another one.

151
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:07,212
I'd really like to ease that girl's mind.

152
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,923
Too bad we don't find anything out down here.

153
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,718
I already spoke with our colleague.

154
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,182
He intimated
that we could let the Scholls go.

155
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:24,145
They want to take the train to Ulm today
to pick up laundry from home.

156
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,315
They even have an empty suitcase,

157
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:31,068
which was just the right size
to fit all the leaflets.

158
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,740
A nice girl.

159
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,160
A leader in the German Girls League!

160
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,455
He's not bad either.

161
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,123
A sergeant. Already served in Russia.

162
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,042
Student company.

163
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,422
No, Fräulein Gebel,

164
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:55,343
traitors who keep the leadership in Berlin
on their toes do not look like this.

165
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,393
Yes.

166
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:05,853
Yes, sir.

167
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:09,148
Nothing.

168
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,903
6:30, yes.

169
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,780
The list of names.

170
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:17,698
Yes, sir.

171
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:46,395
The Scholls will be further interrogated
right away. They're not to be fed.

172
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:52,985
Fräulein Else, dinner!

173
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,930
Tell her that her brother was able
to deny everything.

174
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,848
Does he have anything to hide?

175
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,813
They found stamps
belonging to Hans and me.

176
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:32,565
Where?

177
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,027
In the apartment.

178
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,947
So? What's the harm in that?

179
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:41,700
270 of them.

180
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,792
I told them that I always stock up

181
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,502
because I write a lot.

182
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,088
And it's true.
I love to write letters.

183
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,300
Especially to my family.

184
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:03,263
But he asked if I send them printed material.

185
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,143
Did you have three-cent stamps...

186
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:11,187
Yes.

187
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,492
I...

188
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:28,580
Sometimes they even let me get my hair done.

189
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,458
Is there a hairdresser here?
- No.

190
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:34,837
In town.

191
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:36,963
I am under guard,

192
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,507
but it's not particularly heavy.

193
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:45,722
A girlfriend of mine told me

194
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,727
that she received a leaflet in the mail.

195
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,230
A leaflet from the "White Rose."

196
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,067
I immediately loved that name.

197
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,195
And did you read it?

198
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,405
Yes.

199
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,073
A few weeks later.

200
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,953
It said what we all are thinking.

201
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:15,877
That every honest German is ashamed
of his government today.

202
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,842
Then they got extremely agitated
in here.

203
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:26,095
Every time they heard
about one of those campaigns...

204
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:29,140
They were all abuzz in here.

205
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:00,672
Who's your case worker?

206
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,215
Mahr.

207
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:07,137
That's good. He's a decent man.

208
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,558
He's fair.

209
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:14,477
Yes.

210
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:19,817
Decent even, for one of them.

211
00:23:23,112 --> 00:23:25,322
Did you have enough to eat?
- Yes, thanks.

212
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,575
Can I do anything else for you?

213
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,995
I'm dying for one of my cigarettes.

214
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:36,500
Scholl, Sophia.
Prepare for interrogation.

215
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:38,042
I'll get them for later.

216
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:47,927
Are you still working, Fräulein Else?
It's already past eight.

217
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:55,102
I had to register the new students.

218
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,813
God, they land in here
because they picked up a leaflet.

219
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,983
They're finding more and more
incriminating evidence.

220
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,862
They already have the paint and the brushes.

221
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,697
I heard it from Fietz,
who's in the cell with Scholl.

222
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:11,618
Do you have a cigarette?
For Sophie.

223
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:47,945
Don't.

224
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:50,907
Don't!

225
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:56,955
No.

226
00:24:58,457 --> 00:24:59,582
No!

227
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:04,337
She...

228
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:06,965
She...

229
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:08,883
She is...

230
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:11,762
She is...

231
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,238
Day 2.

232
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:35,118
Friday, the 19th of February, 1943.

233
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,870
7:30 a.m.

234
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:47,213
Was she released last night?

235
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,340
She's still being interrogated.

236
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:51,008
For thirteen hours?

237
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,737
You can go home.
- What about my brother?

238
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,530
We're keeping him here.

239
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,833
The brother's already back.

240
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,918
He confessed.

241
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,713
He took responsibility for it all.
She should deny her part in it.

242
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,392
Graf, Willi. Born January 2nd, 1918,

243
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:43,268
Kuchenheim...

244
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,112
Graf, Anneliese.

245
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,867
No, not Anneliese Graf.
We just released her again.

246
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,328
Have you already had coffee?
- No.

247
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,330
Well, go get some.

248
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,505
You haven't had any coffee today,
Fräulein Else.

249
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:29,815
You can drink your coffee here, too.

250
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:39,617
Thanks.

251
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,167
It was better last night.

252
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,130
Did he...

253
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:59,595
Did Mahr offer you anything?

254
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,098
Real coffee.

255
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,975
Let me tell you, that was really good.

256
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,355
Would you like a cigarette?

257
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:12,025
Thanks.

258
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,130
Unlock the cell.

259
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:36,842
Yes.

260
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,593
Let's go.

261
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,637
Can I go with them?

262
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:43,305
I need to get something.

263
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:45,767
It's that time of the month.

264
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,525
I'll be right back to get you.

265
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,322
I don't even know your name.

266
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,907
Else.

267
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:31,312
The air smells so good!

268
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:40,947
I took the blame for it all. Else.

269
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:44,158
Maybe I'll get Hans released.

270
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:49,955
Your brother took the blame for it all.
I hoped...

271
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:54,127
I mean, he hoped to get you released.

272
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:59,382
Don't you want to lie down?

273
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:13,478
Do you want to tell me why you're here?

274
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:17,942
I was the messenger.
But only once.

275
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,820
When they caught me,
they'd already arrested the others.

276
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,323
Bavarian royalists?

277
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:28,202
You mean, because I look so respectable?

278
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,662
No, no.

279
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,957
Leftists. Communists.

280
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:37,962
As far as I know, 48 of us were arrested
in Munich and Berlin.

281
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:40,382
My brother, too.

282
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:43,760
He was an officer and purser in Berlin.

283
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:48,472
He's also been in jail for a year
without a trial.

284
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,310
His views are very radical.

285
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,103
Sabotage in every sector.

286
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,942
Rendering food inedible,
for example.

287
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:03,988
Anything to ruin Germany as it is now
as quickly as possible.

288
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,703
Would you like one of my nightgowns?
- Yes.

289
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:14,415
You shouldn't have to wear
the same things day and night.

290
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,350
I've never been able
to just look at water.

291
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:35,728
A stream, a pond...

292
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,898
Off went my shoes and socks
and I'd dip my feet in at least,

293
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,817
even if it was really cold.

294
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,572
At home in Forchtenberg,

295
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:49,450
there was a flat levee.
As kids, we always played there.

296
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:52,453
I loved that.

297
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:54,705
There.

298
00:31:55,498 --> 00:31:56,915
Try it on.

299
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:03,882
They found the design for a new leaflet
at our apartment.

300
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,260
Soon they'll have figured out
who wrote it.

301
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:08,593
Was it you?

302
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:10,638
No, no. It wasn't Hans either.

303
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,850
Let's hope they don't catch him.

304
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:16,810
They arrested students again last night.

305
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,730
Named Graf.

306
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,108
The girl was released this morning.

307
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:23,652
Oh, that's great!

308
00:32:23,818 --> 00:32:25,570
Was it his design?

309
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:31,617
I don't know you. Hello.

310
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,995
Heil Hitler.
- Else, could I have my cigarettes?

311
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:37,623
Only by request.
- Yes, of course.

312
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:40,250
We'll ask upstairs first.

313
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,680
12 noon.

314
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,853
Not having to deny it anymore
makes everything easy.

315
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:44,232
The denying was the worst part.

316
00:33:47,527 --> 00:33:50,278
Now we have to be smart
to protect our friends.

317
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:54,450
How smart do you think Hans is?
He's got brains.

318
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,745
Do you know what Mahr told me?
- What?

319
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:02,958
His colleague,
the one interrogating Hans,

320
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:07,172
said that in his entire career

321
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:09,757
he'd never encountered such a lucid mind.

322
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:14,553
That he was the kind of person,
on whom Germany's future depended.

323
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,972
Yes, I'm sure he thought that.

324
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:22,937
When I didn't answer,
he started lecturing me.

325
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:25,440
...eliminated unemployment.

326
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:28,692
We've done away with the class system

327
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:31,903
and cast off the Jewish parasites.

328
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:37,785
The Führer has scored major victories

329
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,663
and given the Aryan race new Lebensraum.

330
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,833
There are good races and inferior ones.

331
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:50,965
The Führer is allowed to do wrong
when the good of the nation demands it.

332
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:56,220
We must obey him,
no matter what he orders us to do.

333
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,892
Because he sees the big picture,
while we only think of ourselves.

334
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:11,735
Look, Fräulein Scholl,

335
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:15,698
your humanitarianism is sentimental.

336
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:19,785
You people and your petty
individual morality,

337
00:35:19,952 --> 00:35:23,205
do you want to return to the chaos
of the Weimar Republic?

338
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:26,875
You call for the military to be undermined.

339
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,337
Do you really want to negate everything

340
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:35,217
that the German people have made great
sacrifices to achieve since 1933?

341
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:40,305
There is such a thing as German honor.

342
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,808
Even you must feel it in your blood,

343
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:46,395
whether you want to or not.

344
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,613
Fräulein Scholl,
if you had thought about all that,

345
00:35:57,698 --> 00:36:03,287
you would never have allowed yourself
to be seduced into committing such acts.

346
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:07,708
You're mistaken.

347
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,170
I would do it all again,
exactly the same way.

348
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,298
Because it's your worldview that's false,
not mine.

349
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,803
I would do it all again,
exactly the same way.

350
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,142
Because I feel guilty.

351
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:27,143
Guilty...

352
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,400
Guilty of the murder of Jewish people.

353
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:37,613
Of the abduction of girls
from the Polish nobility to SS brothels.

354
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:42,743
Of the deaths of the young men
torn to pieces in barbed wire...

355
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:49,292
and the innocent soldiers who froze
and starved at Stalingrad.

356
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,380
Of the degradation of women,

357
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,925
as we are reduced
to being baby-making machines.

358
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:04,473
I feel guilty

359
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,518
because we may no longer read and write,

360
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,105
say, listen to and look at the things

361
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,860
that we consider good, beautiful,
worth knowing and true.

362
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,865
Guilty,

363
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:24,410
because I was too weak...

364
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:27,913
too frightened and too apathetic

365
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:33,043
to commit all, all of my strength
and all, all of my mind

366
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,047
to one thing: fighting against
this inhuman, murderous regime.

367
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:41,843
But what you do is directed
against the Fatherland.

368
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,972
What I do is on its behalf.

369
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:48,977
That's how you ease your guilty conscience.

370
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,190
He was trying to build a bridge.

371
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,983
I know, Else.

372
00:37:57,902 --> 00:38:01,155
You said that you needed
to be smart for your friends.

373
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:03,657
Please, Sophie, do it for yourself as well.

374
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,617
It will be over soon.

375
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,372
Think about your relatives
and the time after this.

376
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:13,708
No, I couldn't go on living after that.

377
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:18,505
They have made a mockery of everything
precious to mankind.

378
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:20,758
They've debased and butchered it.

379
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,553
Should I say that they're right?

380
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,350
You also have an obligation to stay alive.

381
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,520
Yes, Else...

382
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:36,898
You're so good-hearted.

383
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:43,030
I totally agree with you
that only life can create life.

384
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:44,782
Yes, Sophie, yes.

385
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:49,078
A dead mother can't bear children.

386
00:38:49,245 --> 00:38:50,997
No, Sophie, no.

387
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:59,297
Do you remember that scene
in the Old Testament?

388
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,510
When Moses held his arms up in prayer
day and night, hour after hour,

389
00:39:04,677 --> 00:39:08,347
asking God for victory?

390
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,018
And when he let his arms drop,

391
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:16,313
then his people lost favor in battle.

392
00:39:20,192 --> 00:39:22,778
I can't let my arms drop now.

393
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:07,532
I had the same dream again.

394
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,742
Will you tell it to me?

395
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,332
I was taking a walk with Hans and Schurik.

396
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:21,712
I was in the middle, arm in arm with them.

397
00:40:23,797 --> 00:40:25,925
I was partly walking,

398
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,468
partly skipping

399
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:34,433
and partly being lifted in the air
by the two of them and floating along.

400
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,603
Then Hans said:

401
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:42,190
"I know a very simple way to prove

402
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:46,112
the existence and agency of God
even in the present day.

403
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:51,033
Human beings need so much air to breathe.

404
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:56,080
Over the years
the whole sky should be polluted

405
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:58,748
by stale human breath.

406
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,960
But...

407
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,965
to keep this food for the blood
of mankind from running out,

408
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:12,597
God breathes a mouthful of his breath
into our world from time to time.

409
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:16,475
It pervades the stale air and replaces it.

410
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:18,185
That's how he does it."

411
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:27,110
Then Hans pointed his face
toward the gloomy, gloomy sky.

412
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:31,157
He took a deep breath

413
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,328
and blew all the air from his open mouth.

414
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:46,755
The shaft of his rising breath
was a brilliant shade of blue.

415
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:50,842
It grew large and then larger...

416
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,472
and went all the way up to the sky.

417
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,810
It pushed away the dirty clouds

418
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:06,692
and in front of us,
above us and around us

419
00:42:07,902 --> 00:42:10,112
was the clearest, bluest sky.

420
00:42:13,323 --> 00:42:15,367
It was beautiful.

421
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,878
Fräulein Scholl,
please prepare for interrogation.

422
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:34,720
You would have had to work
on them for half a year

423
00:42:34,887 --> 00:42:39,558
in order for you and your brother
to produce the 25,000 leaflets on your own.

424
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:45,688
But you were studying and your brother
was at the front for seven months.

425
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,360
We worked hard, day and night.

426
00:42:51,278 --> 00:42:55,490
You want to protect your friends,
but you're dragging them deeper into it.

427
00:42:56,867 --> 00:42:58,827
You should have heard,
for example,

428
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,830
how often Fräulein Schertling
has contradicted herself.

429
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,585
Your circle has been exposed.
We know who your accomplices are.

430
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:11,423
Every name you withhold from us
becomes twice as interesting to us.

431
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:17,178
Fräulein Scholl, are you listening to me?

432
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:23,685
You can take a break.

433
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:33,570
I'd like to ask you something.

434
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:40,577
It's common knowledge
that the Gestapo tortures suspects.

435
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,080
That the Gestapo...

436
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:49,252
tortures suspects
to extract confessions from them.

437
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:55,133
Don't you think it's only right
to extract confessions from them?

438
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,303
I don't intend to have you tortured.

439
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:03,017
I've been a civil servant for 25 years.
I'm doing my duty.

440
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:09,690
I don't dislike you, Fräulein Scholl,
but I can't do anything for you

441
00:44:10,107 --> 00:44:12,275
unless you meet me halfway.

442
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:14,403
Well?

443
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:16,530
What do you want?

444
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:20,200
How is my brother?

445
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:46,745
9 p.m.

446
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,122
Paul's epistle to the Romans.

447
00:45:51,375 --> 00:45:54,335
"I am convinced that the suffering
of the current times...

448
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:01,385
is nothing compared to the splendor
that will be revealed to us.

449
00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:11,728
We know that up until this moment
all of creation

450
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:14,690
has been groaning in expectation.

451
00:46:16,317 --> 00:46:17,985
Not only it,

452
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:21,028
but we ourselves as well,

453
00:46:21,197 --> 00:46:23,657
who have the first fruits of the Spirit,

454
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:25,867
groan inwardly

455
00:46:26,368 --> 00:46:30,247
and wait for adoption,
the redemption of our bodies.

456
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,835
For although we are saved,

457
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:37,838
it is in hope.

458
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:42,383
But hope that is seen

459
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,468
is not hope,

460
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,848
for who can hope for something
that he can see?

461
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:54,478
But if we hope for what we do not see,

462
00:46:54,605 --> 00:46:56,982
we wait for it patiently."

463
00:46:59,527 --> 00:47:01,487
Bang, what did I tell you!

464
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:04,532
Now we have to get undressed
in the dark like two prudes.

465
00:47:13,123 --> 00:47:14,917
Do you like to dance?
- No.

466
00:47:16,502 --> 00:47:18,795
I really love to dance sometimes.

467
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:25,010
A girl at school once complained
about my indecent way of dancing.

468
00:47:25,177 --> 00:47:27,428
I'm sure she was just jealous.
There!

469
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,222
Thanks.

470
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:37,982
Some pop songs are really funny.

471
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:42,027
That one made us laugh so much!

472
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,737
Which one?

473
00:47:44,613 --> 00:47:46,990
Do you know "Can Love Be a Sin"?

474
00:47:47,157 --> 00:47:48,200
Of course.

475
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,910
At the orphanage

476
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,830
where I did my internship
as a kindergarten teacher,

477
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,750
that was our favorite song.

478
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,293
And once,

479
00:48:00,212 --> 00:48:03,465
when I was bawling out one of those rascals,

480
00:48:04,842 --> 00:48:07,052
he stood there in front of me

481
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:10,013
and sang in a little boy's bass voice:

482
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,890
"Can love be a sin?"

483
00:48:13,642 --> 00:48:16,185
Now the ribbon is all tangled up.

484
00:48:16,353 --> 00:48:18,063
Let me help you.

485
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:22,650
Wait.

486
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:37,165
Do you have anyone on the outside
waiting for you?

487
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,002
You mean a man?
- Yes.

488
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:43,672
No.
Men have always found me off-putting.

489
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:46,132
Off-putting?

490
00:48:46,717 --> 00:48:48,010
How so?

491
00:48:48,677 --> 00:48:50,720
Well, not that there were many of them.

492
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:55,475
I always said right away
how I imagined being in a relationship.

493
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:57,352
That scared them away.

494
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:58,562
Yes,

495
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:02,983
we're only supposed to show our need
for affection. That impresses them.

496
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,068
Now it's untied.

497
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:06,695
Thanks.

498
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:38,852
I like being alone.

499
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:41,730
I need it.

500
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:48,778
Me not so much.

501
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,865
But I always have my clients anyway.

502
00:49:52,365 --> 00:49:53,492
Clients?

503
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,870
One lady can't get down the stairs
by herself.

504
00:49:57,037 --> 00:49:59,832
I feed the bird for other ones
when they're on holiday.

505
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,958
Another wants to cry on my shoulder.

506
00:50:03,127 --> 00:50:04,837
There's always something going on.

507
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,422
Strangers?

508
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,548
They're not strangers for long.

509
00:50:13,803 --> 00:50:15,847
"Be not only hearers,

510
00:50:16,807 --> 00:50:19,100
but also doers of the word."

511
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:21,937
Yes, Sophie.

512
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:25,523
For me there's only the one faith
and the one hope.

513
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:32,530
But I also do things for myself.

514
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:35,533
The main thing is my choir.

515
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:37,285
You sing?

516
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:40,663
In the church choir.
I like Bach best of all.

517
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,998
Yes, you can't fake it with Bach.

518
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:45,502
That's true.

519
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,923
Do you play an instrument?

520
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:51,967
Piano.

521
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:57,930
When I feel bad,
I like to concentrate on Bach.

522
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:14,197
Do you want to go to sleep?

523
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:16,825
No.

524
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:25,042
Where's your home?

525
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:28,295
In Ulm.

526
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:33,383
My father has an office
on Münsterplatz.

527
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,347
He's an tax accountant.

528
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:44,853
He spent two months in prison last fall

529
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:47,563
for calling Hitler a "Scourge of God."

530
00:51:49,817 --> 00:51:52,027
His secretary ratted on him.

531
00:51:55,488 --> 00:51:59,033
He was a conscientious objector
during the First World War

532
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:02,245
and did his service at a military hospital.

533
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:06,542
That's where he met my mother.

534
00:52:08,752 --> 00:52:10,962
She was a Deaconess nurse.

535
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,258
Where do your parents live?

536
00:52:17,135 --> 00:52:18,762
They're no longer with us.

537
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:21,055
My father died when I was 15.

538
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:22,765
He was a newspaperman.

539
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:25,227
A journalist?
- No, administration.

540
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:28,188
He ended up
as a publishing house director.

541
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:30,357
A restless guy.

542
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:33,025
He always got into quarrels
and had to move on.

543
00:52:33,402 --> 00:52:35,612
My mother got really sick of it.

544
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:38,823
And at one point they were in Augsburg.

545
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,867
That's where I was born.

546
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:42,910
Do you have any more
brothers and sisters?

547
00:52:43,453 --> 00:52:45,288
Yes, Arno.

548
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:49,042
He's apolitical,
nothing like Willy.

549
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:54,838
I kept house for Willy for 15 years
after Mother died.

550
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:58,175
What about you?

551
00:53:00,345 --> 00:53:01,470
What?

552
00:53:01,805 --> 00:53:04,307
Any brothers and sisters
besides Hans?

553
00:53:07,227 --> 00:53:08,520
There are five of us,

554
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:10,855
three girls and two boys.

555
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,858
I spent my first seven years
in Forchtenberg am Kocher

556
00:53:15,027 --> 00:53:16,653
in Würrtemberg.

557
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:20,407
It was like a little medieval town.

558
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,658
They still had a stagecoach.

559
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,747
My father was the mayor.

560
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,832
Built a railway

561
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:31,960
and sewers.

562
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:36,798
Then they voted him out of office.
Too progressive.

563
00:53:40,677 --> 00:53:42,345
On Saturdays...

564
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,640
we would go from the mayor's house
to the bakery

565
00:53:46,642 --> 00:53:48,810
and then take a bath in the big tub.

566
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:53,188
Afterwards, we'd have pretzels.

567
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,113
What kind of dog is that?

568
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:02,740
Have you seen one of them?

569
00:54:03,908 --> 00:54:05,368
They're Great Danes.

570
00:54:05,535 --> 00:54:07,828
In the communication trench.
It's quite...

571
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,833
Go on with your story!

572
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,543
Where was I?

573
00:54:15,128 --> 00:54:17,130
You had to take care of your brother.

574
00:54:17,297 --> 00:54:18,507
Oh yes.

575
00:54:20,425 --> 00:54:23,218
I was 20 when my mother died.

576
00:54:23,387 --> 00:54:24,887
It was very hard.

577
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,767
My girlfriend always talks about
how sad I looked

578
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:33,103
when I started working at Uhlfelder's
dressed all in black.

579
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:37,775
Because we were always giggling later on.

580
00:54:48,703 --> 00:54:50,288
What's Uhlfelder's?

581
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,210
It was a department store
here in Munich.

582
00:54:55,877 --> 00:54:58,170
It was expropriated four years ago.

583
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:01,675
After the horrible...

584
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:04,927
Night of Broken Glass?

585
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,262
Yes.

586
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:13,520
Our boss, Mr. Uhlfelder, was a fine man.

587
00:55:13,687 --> 00:55:15,105
Kind...

588
00:55:15,563 --> 00:55:17,607
Our pet name for him was "Father."

589
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,527
My girlfriend was his secretary

590
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:22,612
and I was in bookkeeping.

591
00:55:25,657 --> 00:55:27,992
The morning
of the 10th of November, 1938,

592
00:55:28,577 --> 00:55:31,245
we tried to get in the store: closed.

593
00:55:31,788 --> 00:55:33,623
The windows had been smashed.

594
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,792
It was still burning in the back.

595
00:55:37,627 --> 00:55:40,297
"Let that Jewish swine's business burn down!"

596
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:42,798
said an SA trooper.

597
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:46,052
"Yes, of course!" said a fireman.

598
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:48,972
"Let the whole street burn with it."

599
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:51,057
Then they put the fire out.

600
00:55:53,643 --> 00:55:56,813
The Nazis had gotten our boss
out of bed during the night.

601
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:01,777
He was forced to stand in his pyjamas
for hours in an open delivery van.

602
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,028
Then they took him to Dachau...

603
00:56:05,947 --> 00:56:08,032
Fortunately he was able to get out.

604
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:11,285
But I don't know where he is now.

605
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,207
Before that, were you

606
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:18,333
friendly towards the Nazis?

607
00:56:18,543 --> 00:56:19,668
No, never.

608
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:24,048
That goes against my Christian beliefs.

609
00:56:26,008 --> 00:56:27,468
It was different for us.

610
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,097
My father warned us from the start.

611
00:56:33,558 --> 00:56:35,643
We were impressed by the Hitler Youth.

612
00:56:36,895 --> 00:56:38,438
Hans especially.

613
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,067
Campfires, patriotism, camaraderie...

614
00:56:43,985 --> 00:56:45,987
Singing, outings and all of that!

615
00:56:48,782 --> 00:56:50,617
I was even a leader in the Girls League.

616
00:56:53,537 --> 00:56:56,163
But when Hans came back
from the Nuremberg convention,

617
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:58,458
he was a changed man.

618
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,252
The mindless marching...

619
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:06,215
the platitudes, the boasting,
the cruel jokes!

620
00:57:08,927 --> 00:57:12,847
At that time, one of our friends, Otl Aicher,
made a great impression on us.

621
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:18,687
Right before finishing school,
he refused to join the Hitler Youth

622
00:57:18,853 --> 00:57:21,188
and put his graduation at risk.

623
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,402
He would always bring us books
and familiarize us with them,

624
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:29,905
like the Confessions of St. Augustine.

625
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:33,367
Theodor Haecker, Pascal,

626
00:57:34,077 --> 00:57:35,453
Bernanos.

627
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:43,962
We then found out that the Nazis
were killing mentally handicapped kids,

628
00:57:46,172 --> 00:57:48,382
and more and more horrible things.

629
00:57:58,017 --> 00:58:01,187
After graduating,
in order to avoid the National Labor Service,

630
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:03,773
I enrolled in kindergarten training.

631
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:07,735
But they stuck me in an arms factory...

632
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:12,573
Some nice women from Russia
were slave laborers there.

633
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,410
They sabotaged all kinds of detonators.

634
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:21,332
Finally, I was allowed to study!

635
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:24,335
In Munich.

636
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,258
That was a whole new world.

637
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:36,138
One day Hans said:

638
00:58:37,265 --> 00:58:40,183
"What we need is a copy machine."

639
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,523
Are you asleep?

640
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:50,110
No, Sophie. I'm listening.

641
00:58:57,535 --> 00:58:58,995
Day 3.

642
00:58:59,162 --> 00:59:02,373
Saturday, the 20th of February, 1943.

643
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,875
Midday.

644
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,545
The new arrivals are to be registered.

645
00:59:08,337 --> 00:59:11,757
The interrogations are on Saturday,
none on Sunday probably.

646
00:59:12,717 --> 00:59:15,553
If anything is still unclear,
ask the supervisor.

647
00:59:17,222 --> 00:59:20,850
Well, you're almost like
a real employee here.

648
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:26,063
Contact with upstairs...

649
00:59:27,523 --> 00:59:30,985
You know who I mean:
Hans Scholl and Willi Graf...

650
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:34,488
...is absolutely forbidden.
I'm warning you.

651
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:40,243
Well, what you people downstairs do...

652
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:47,043
Help yourself to that tea
that your girlfriend brought me.

653
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,345
All right then, see you Monday.

654
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:05,478
Yes?

655
01:00:06,103 --> 01:00:07,563
Yes, he's still here.

656
01:00:07,855 --> 01:00:09,023
It's for you.

657
01:00:15,363 --> 01:00:16,405
Yes?

658
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,908
You too.

659
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:22,412
All right. Heil Hitler!

660
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,665
No further interrogations this weekend.

661
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,047
Sophie!

662
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:36,967
You're done with interrogations for today
and tomorrow. Isn't that nice?

663
01:00:37,135 --> 01:00:39,012
I don't know.
- Come on now!

664
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:44,600
I think these interrogations are interesting.
I find them stimulating.

665
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:47,728
4 p.m.

666
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:51,982
I've wanted this agonizing sadness to end
once and for all so many times.

667
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:55,778
It's ruined every desire I had
to do anything.

668
01:00:57,863 --> 01:01:00,115
When I picked up a book,

669
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,618
it was as if someone else were doing it.

670
01:01:05,497 --> 01:01:07,207
I often thought that I'd much rather

671
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:11,252
experience the worst pain,
even merely physical,

672
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,880
than this empty stillness.

673
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:19,968
Now do you see
why I want the interrogations to go on?

674
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:22,097
Why I want it to go on at all?

675
01:01:32,398 --> 01:01:34,442
I brought you a little something.

676
01:01:47,163 --> 01:01:48,205
Thanks.

677
01:01:54,212 --> 01:01:57,632
That's really very, very nice
of you, Mr. Mahr.

678
01:01:58,507 --> 01:02:00,718
Have a nice weekend.

679
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:03,888
Thank you, Fräulein Scholl.
I must get back to work.

680
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,687
Enjoy the food.

681
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:18,485
I need to go to the office.
- What for?

682
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,030
The boss is fine with it.
You'll get some, too.

683
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:28,830
5 p.m.

684
01:02:59,568 --> 01:03:00,653
There!

685
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:03,072
We're rich!

686
01:03:04,865 --> 01:03:07,702
Look how rich we are.

687
01:03:16,002 --> 01:03:17,837
Where did you get that?

688
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:20,507
My girlfriend brought it for you.

689
01:03:20,673 --> 01:03:23,968
But you have to give some to Fatty.
He's not always so nice.

690
01:03:42,653 --> 01:03:44,405
What's going on here?

691
01:03:44,572 --> 01:03:46,782
Fatty's in a good mood today.

692
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,547
Yes, Philip!

693
01:04:02,465 --> 01:04:03,548
Well...

694
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,623
Butter.

695
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:39,793
What are you?
Where did you pick that up?

696
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,545
My mother brought it.

697
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:44,423
Are you from a farm?
- Yes.

698
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,300
We don't have a knife.

699
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,142
Come on, Sophie. Help me.

700
01:05:07,572 --> 01:05:10,742
Further to the left.
The table has to fit in between.

701
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,050
Sit down.

702
01:06:24,065 --> 01:06:25,565
How nice!

703
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:41,517
Where are you from?

704
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:43,560
From Rotis.

705
01:07:45,437 --> 01:07:46,813
Where is Rotis?

706
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:49,150
In the Allgäu.

707
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,487
This tea is really good.

708
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:00,118
How big is Rotis?

709
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:03,663
The mill is in the south,

710
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,667
we're up there,

711
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:09,920
the woodcutter is back there
where the wood is.

712
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:14,467
Seven farms or so spread out.

713
01:08:27,688 --> 01:08:29,857
How did you land here?

714
01:08:31,817 --> 01:08:33,777
Because of my hobby.

715
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:37,322
Valentin is a ham radio operator.

716
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:39,700
Your name is Valentin?

717
01:08:41,327 --> 01:08:43,537
He picked up all the foreign signals.

718
01:08:45,747 --> 01:08:47,833
From London, Stockholm.

719
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:51,962
People came to him from far away
to listen on the sly.

720
01:08:54,465 --> 01:08:55,715
Moscow.

721
01:08:57,760 --> 01:08:59,637
I picked it up, too.

722
01:09:01,388 --> 01:09:03,098
It must be nice.

723
01:09:04,183 --> 01:09:05,517
Other countries...

724
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,813
The ability to just travel
to wherever you want.

725
01:09:15,402 --> 01:09:17,738
Come on, Valentin, have a cookie.

726
01:09:17,905 --> 01:09:19,615
Thanks.
- They're good.

727
01:09:20,908 --> 01:09:23,035
Would you like tea, Philip?

728
01:09:34,297 --> 01:09:35,923
Your name is Valentin.

729
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:41,595
Karl Valentin is my absolute favorite.

730
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:44,723
"I would have liked to want to,

731
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:47,392
but I was afraid to allow myself to."

732
01:09:49,603 --> 01:09:51,730
This tea is so delicious.

733
01:09:54,692 --> 01:09:56,943
That was a feast fit for a king.

734
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,697
All we need now is some music.

735
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,448
Or theater.

736
01:10:02,908 --> 01:10:04,243
Or a film.

737
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:09,373
Well...

738
01:10:11,292 --> 01:10:13,585
Put the bed back there.

739
01:10:30,602 --> 01:10:32,228
That too, please.

740
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,990
Here, the front row!

741
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:20,457
Yes, Philip!
You could perform that anywhere.

742
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,708
That's what I do, Fräulein Else.

743
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,878
That's my profession.

744
01:14:26,963 --> 01:14:29,465
Until they locked me up for doing that.

745
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:43,480
Thank you.

746
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:45,815
It was very beautiful.

747
01:14:47,525 --> 01:14:49,528
Everyone, all of us inside here,

748
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:52,822
are impressed by you.

749
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:55,617
Even the others,

750
01:14:56,202 --> 01:14:57,660
the Gestapo.

751
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:01,998
We're powerless.

752
01:15:03,417 --> 01:15:04,710
But you all...

753
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:08,672
You are...

754
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:11,758
Hope.

755
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:17,847
The White Rose.

756
01:15:20,267 --> 01:15:22,895
In our desolation...

757
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:26,648
your voices were...

758
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:30,818
Our heads...
We raised our heads up!

759
01:15:32,905 --> 01:15:34,197
Hope!

760
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,825
Hope.

761
01:15:40,662 --> 01:15:43,290
The White Rose's leaflets...

762
01:15:47,085 --> 01:15:48,587
Hope...

763
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,882
We could use some more tea.

764
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,977
This has to stop now.
I'm putting my neck on the line.

765
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:13,528
Look at the moon.

766
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,620
"The moon has risen.

767
01:16:24,748 --> 01:16:27,917
The golden stars shine
in the sky, bright and clear.

768
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,838
The wood stands black and silent

769
01:16:33,215 --> 01:16:37,052
and from the meadows
the white mist miraculously rises."

770
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:47,187
"...and from the meadows
the white mist miraculously rises."

771
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,443
"How is the world so quiet

772
01:16:54,527 --> 01:16:57,363
and, wrapped in dusk,
so sad and so lovely?

773
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:03,453
Like a quiet chamber
where you can sleep away

774
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:05,705
and forget the misery of the day."

775
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:14,588
"...where you can sleep away
and forget the misery of the day."

776
01:17:18,052 --> 01:17:19,928
"Do you see the moon up there?

777
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:24,892
You can only see half of it,
but it is round and beautiful.

778
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:31,063
That's true of many things
that we safely laugh at,

779
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,777
because our eyes can't see them.

780
01:17:38,155 --> 01:17:41,492
We proud children of man
are poor, vain sinners

781
01:17:42,033 --> 01:17:43,743
who do not know much at all.

782
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,205
We spin webs of air

783
01:17:48,165 --> 01:17:51,543
and seek many arts
and get further away from our goal."

784
01:17:54,755 --> 01:17:57,757
"God, let us see your salvation,

785
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:00,468
let us neither trust in transitory things

786
01:18:00,635 --> 01:18:02,720
nor enjoy vanity!

787
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:05,932
Let us become naive

788
01:18:06,767 --> 01:18:12,063
and let us be, in your eyes, here on earth,
devout and happy like children."

789
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:17,443
"...devout and happy like children."

790
01:18:20,447 --> 01:18:24,868
"Take us in the end
without grief from this world

791
01:18:25,743 --> 01:18:27,870
in gentle death.

792
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:33,710
And when you take us,
let us get to heaven,

793
01:18:34,837 --> 01:18:37,005
you, our Lord and our God."

794
01:18:41,427 --> 01:18:45,972
"So lie down, brothers,
in God's name.

795
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:49,977
The evening breeze is cold.

796
01:18:51,895 --> 01:18:54,105
Spare us punishment, God,

797
01:18:54,815 --> 01:18:56,817
and let us sleep peacefully,

798
01:18:58,485 --> 01:19:00,945
along with our sick neighbor!"

799
01:19:06,827 --> 01:19:08,245
Day 4.

800
01:19:08,412 --> 01:19:12,957
Sunday, the 21st of February, 1943.

801
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:14,083
8 a.m.

802
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,293
New arrival last night.

803
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:32,602
Another person was brought in last night.
- Who?

804
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,353
I don't know.

805
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,107
But probably one of you.

806
01:19:43,155 --> 01:19:46,825
On Sundays I work at 10 a.m. for two hours.

807
01:19:47,325 --> 01:19:49,035
I can check then.

808
01:19:49,202 --> 01:19:51,287
What might the name be?

809
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:55,125
I don't want to burden you with knowing that.

810
01:19:56,752 --> 01:19:58,837
The first name starts with an A.

811
01:20:15,062 --> 01:20:18,440
My brother Werner should be home
on leave from Russia any day now.

812
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:23,195
That would nice for our parents now.
- Stalingrad?

813
01:20:23,362 --> 01:20:24,863
No, luckily.

814
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:29,408
But my fiancé is in Stalingrad.

815
01:20:30,035 --> 01:20:32,162
I'm very worried about him.

816
01:20:33,747 --> 01:20:35,165
Is he good-looking?

817
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:37,375
Yes.

818
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:43,130
Sometimes I'm afraid of influencing him
too much.

819
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:46,383
Have you been together long?

820
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:54,433
Do you think our parents have found out
that we're here?

821
01:20:56,435 --> 01:21:00,815
Did any of your friends at the University
see you being taken away?

822
01:21:02,525 --> 01:21:06,572
We looked past all of them to avoid
incriminating them, but I think so.

823
01:21:06,738 --> 01:21:08,948
Then your parents know.

824
01:21:10,325 --> 01:21:12,493
Aren't they allowed to visit us?

825
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:20,252
If the Gestapo doesn't get anything more
from their questioning, then for sure.

826
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:23,380
Maybe even tomorrow.

827
01:21:25,382 --> 01:21:26,633
Tomorrow?

828
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:14,097
The first name doesn't start
with an A, Sophie.

829
01:22:14,347 --> 01:22:17,475
It's a student named Christoph Probst.
- No!

830
01:22:17,642 --> 01:22:18,727
Sophie!

831
01:22:19,810 --> 01:22:20,937
Sophie!

832
01:22:22,063 --> 01:22:23,607
Calm down.

833
01:22:28,362 --> 01:22:30,197
Yes, Sophie...

834
01:22:30,363 --> 01:22:31,405
Come on!

835
01:22:34,993 --> 01:22:36,410
Who is he?

836
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,872
Is he your fiancé?

837
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:42,542
No.

838
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:47,880
My fiancé

839
01:22:48,673 --> 01:22:50,592
never knew about any of it.

840
01:22:53,553 --> 01:22:55,055
Christoph...

841
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:58,642
designed the new leaflet

842
01:23:01,060 --> 01:23:03,062
that they found on Hans.

843
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:06,065
He...

844
01:23:06,692 --> 01:23:07,900
He has...

845
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,153
He has...

846
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:16,743
He... He has three little kids.

847
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:21,038
His... His wife is down with childbed fever.

848
01:23:28,755 --> 01:23:32,842
Of all people, Chris was to be protected.

849
01:23:35,762 --> 01:23:39,182
If he only designed something,
they can't...

850
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:41,267
Right, Else?
They can't kill him.

851
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:44,228
They can lock him up,
but they can't kill him!

852
01:23:44,395 --> 01:23:46,355
I'm sure they can't.
I'm sure!

853
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:49,400
Now...

854
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:52,487
calm down.

855
01:23:53,530 --> 01:23:54,530
Sophie!

856
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:20,140
Come now.

857
01:24:21,015 --> 01:24:22,142
Come now.

858
01:24:23,602 --> 01:24:25,395
It will be fine.

859
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,315
It will be fine.

860
01:24:35,238 --> 01:24:37,573
Tomorrow you go back to your old cell.

861
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:39,575
Yes, I know.

862
01:24:39,742 --> 01:24:42,078
Freisler, the Chief Prosecutor,

863
01:24:42,245 --> 01:24:44,580
is arriving from Berlin tomorrow
for the trial.

864
01:24:44,747 --> 01:24:46,165
They're not dilly-dallying around.

865
01:24:46,332 --> 01:24:50,170
When is the trial?
- Tomorrow at 10 a.m. Too bad I'm on duty.

866
01:24:50,795 --> 01:24:52,172
At 10 a.m., then?

867
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:55,925
Tomorrow at 10 a.m.
People's Court!

868
01:24:58,512 --> 01:25:00,847
Whatever they did must be really awful.

869
01:25:03,767 --> 01:25:06,727
Don't get dragged into it,
right at the end.

870
01:25:12,525 --> 01:25:13,943
Scholl, Sophia?

871
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:17,405
You must go to the court clerk
to be served the indictment.

872
01:25:51,563 --> 01:25:53,232
3:30 p.m.

873
01:26:28,893 --> 01:26:30,520
Oh, thank God!

874
01:26:34,107 --> 01:26:35,525
None of the others.

875
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:38,862
None of the others.

876
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:42,657
They're only indicting Hans, me
and poor Chris.

877
01:26:47,037 --> 01:26:50,623
Could you get in trouble
for reading the indictment with me?

878
01:26:52,667 --> 01:26:53,627
Come over here.

879
01:27:02,593 --> 01:27:05,555
"Chief Prosecutor
of the People's Court.

880
01:27:06,097 --> 01:27:07,557
Indictment.

881
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:13,312
I hereby charge Hans Fritz Scholl,
Sophia Magdalena Scholl

882
01:27:13,478 --> 01:27:15,648
and Christoph Hermann Probst,

883
01:27:16,357 --> 01:27:18,985
all currently without defense counsel,

884
01:27:20,528 --> 01:27:23,072
with having organized
acts of high treason

885
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:27,577
with intent to change the constitution
of the Reich by force

886
01:27:28,202 --> 01:27:30,913
and with intent

887
01:27:32,082 --> 01:27:35,835
to render the army unfit for fulfillment
of its duty

888
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:40,213
and to publicly cripple and destroy
the will of the German people

889
01:27:40,382 --> 01:27:42,592
for militaristic self-determination.

890
01:27:43,885 --> 01:27:48,597
Crimes in accordance with Paragraphs..."
Paragraph, paragraph, paragraph...

891
01:27:48,765 --> 01:27:52,060
"...of the Special Wartime Penal Code.

892
01:27:54,645 --> 01:27:59,233
In the summer of 1942
and in January and February 1943,

893
01:28:00,067 --> 01:28:04,905
the accused Hans Scholl produced
and distributed leaflets."

894
01:28:07,617 --> 01:28:08,952
4 p.m.

895
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:22,507
The lawyer to see Scholl, Sophia.

896
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:32,725
It is my duty...
Is there anything that you can say...

897
01:28:32,892 --> 01:28:34,143
No.

898
01:28:39,982 --> 01:28:41,192
Well...

899
01:28:42,402 --> 01:28:44,153
Well, perhaps...

900
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:48,657
in view of the fact that you...

901
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:56,207
As a woman...

902
01:28:56,748 --> 01:28:58,458
As a young...

903
01:28:58,625 --> 01:29:02,338
If my brother is condemned to death,
I wish to be condemned to death.

904
01:29:04,048 --> 01:29:06,967
It is my duty to...
- I'm sure you can confirm for me

905
01:29:07,135 --> 01:29:09,928
that my brother has a right
to death by firing squad.

906
01:29:11,972 --> 01:29:13,307
He fought at the front.

907
01:29:17,103 --> 01:29:18,312
That...

908
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:26,528
The Chief Prosecutor has the authority
to decide that.

909
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:29,115
What about me?

910
01:29:33,828 --> 01:29:34,870
What do you mean?

911
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:40,208
Am I to be hanged publicly
or must I be guillotined?

912
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:02,315
As a man,
you really should have stronger nerves.

913
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:06,652
5 p.m.

914
01:30:07,737 --> 01:30:09,863
To lean against a tree.

915
01:30:13,533 --> 01:30:15,703
To feel the strength of the tree.

916
01:30:19,665 --> 01:30:21,542
To feel its bark.

917
01:30:24,628 --> 01:30:25,797
Funny.

918
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:32,093
I've always thought
I'd like to be just a piece of bark.

919
01:30:35,473 --> 01:30:38,142
That image came up again and again.

920
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:40,603
Again and again.

921
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:45,525
To simply be a piece of bark.

922
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:08,422
What a glorious day!

923
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:13,635
And I have to leave.

924
01:31:26,023 --> 01:31:29,402
If people are shaken up
by what's happening to us...

925
01:31:32,530 --> 01:31:35,157
The students will surely revolt.

926
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:37,868
It will cause an uproar.

927
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,082
6 p.m.

928
01:31:58,932 --> 01:32:02,685
I've come back to give you some advice.

929
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:05,270
Unofficially. You understand...

930
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:09,817
Write to your relatives
today if possible.

931
01:32:11,193 --> 01:32:12,487
Do you have pen and paper?

932
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,032
I'll give her what she needs.

933
01:32:24,207 --> 01:32:28,168
Sophie and Hans Scholl wrote
short farewell letters to their parents

934
01:32:28,335 --> 01:32:29,670
and to Inge Scholl.

935
01:32:29,837 --> 01:32:34,550
Sophie Scholl wrote one
to her suitor or fiancé.

936
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:40,013
The letters contained words of gratitude
for the love they received,

937
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:44,143
in addition to stating that they had not
been able to act differently.

938
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:49,523
In one of the letters,
it was expressed that the future

939
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:54,278
would acquit and vindicate
what was now being condemned.

940
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:59,200
Moreover, the letters contained
words of consolation

941
01:32:59,367 --> 01:33:02,160
and an apology for the pain

942
01:33:02,328 --> 01:33:05,080
that they would be inflicting
on the bereaved.

943
01:33:06,207 --> 01:33:09,793
Ultimately, the letters attested
to a profound religious faith.

944
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:13,463
As ordered, the contents
of the farewell letters had to be

945
01:33:13,630 --> 01:33:17,050
reported to the Central Office
for Reich Security.

946
01:33:18,552 --> 01:33:20,805
It was then ordered

947
01:33:21,138 --> 01:33:24,850
that the letters be filed away
without exception

948
01:33:25,392 --> 01:33:28,812
and in no instance allowed
to be delivered,

949
01:33:30,857 --> 01:33:33,233
because otherwise
there would be reason to fear

950
01:33:33,775 --> 01:33:37,195
that they might be exploited as propaganda.

951
01:33:40,825 --> 01:33:42,200
7 p.m.

952
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:04,515
Christoph says hello.

953
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:08,852
And Hans just said one word: "all."

954
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:11,730
Thank you, Philip.

955
01:34:12,398 --> 01:34:15,275
Please give them both
the same message from me.

956
01:34:32,377 --> 01:34:34,712
That's my father's motto, Else.

957
01:34:36,547 --> 01:34:39,425
"Prevail in the face of all pressures."

958
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:42,218
From Goethe.

959
01:34:43,803 --> 01:34:45,138
"All."

960
01:34:45,932 --> 01:34:48,183
That all you need to say to a Scholl.

961
01:34:50,393 --> 01:34:53,355
"In the face of all pressures...

962
01:34:54,065 --> 01:34:55,523
prevail!"

963
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:01,322
You're saying
that I should have saved myself.

964
01:35:05,492 --> 01:35:07,202
I always took that to mean
that Goethe

965
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:10,122
is referring to the personal freedom
of a human being.

966
01:35:11,123 --> 01:35:15,460
Which must be preserved
in the face of all pressures.

967
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:21,133
You can't betray your conscience

968
01:35:22,175 --> 01:35:25,137
and, if need be,
you have to do whatever it takes.

969
01:35:34,188 --> 01:35:35,898
A quarter after ten.

970
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:39,360
They're turning the lights off
so late tonight.

971
01:35:56,710 --> 01:35:58,587
Once this is over...

972
01:36:06,095 --> 01:36:08,805
Are you talking about life after death,
Sophie?

973
01:36:13,893 --> 01:36:14,937
No.

974
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:19,442
About life after the Nazis.

975
01:36:23,028 --> 01:36:24,405
Imagine

976
01:36:26,073 --> 01:36:28,492
simply going into a bookstore

977
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:31,370
and buying a French book.

978
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:38,460
Why are the lights still on?

979
01:36:38,627 --> 01:36:41,505
They have to stay on. Orders from upstairs.
- "Stay on"?

980
01:36:42,255 --> 01:36:45,425
It will stay light all night.
- Well, that's the limit!

981
01:36:57,478 --> 01:36:58,563
"If the people

982
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:03,527
are unaware of the government,
they are happy.

983
01:37:06,863 --> 01:37:09,367
But when the government is intrusive,

984
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:11,827
the people are broken."

985
01:37:17,415 --> 01:37:20,085
The Chinese philosopher Laozi said that.

986
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:24,130
It was in one of our leaflets.

987
01:37:29,428 --> 01:37:31,513
How often do you want to look in here?

988
01:37:32,013 --> 01:37:33,640
Every half hour.

989
01:37:34,267 --> 01:37:36,227
You think we're enjoying this?

990
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:42,190
I think

991
01:37:43,567 --> 01:37:46,445
that Germany will become
a very modest nation.

992
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:50,282
After this.

993
01:37:52,952 --> 01:37:54,662
No more swaggering.

994
01:37:57,998 --> 01:38:02,127
It will have work very hard
to be accepted by other nations again.

995
01:38:06,090 --> 01:38:08,883
Maybe there's won't be
a Germany afterwards.

996
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:12,137
You mean,

997
01:38:13,055 --> 01:38:17,433
Germany will be condemned to death
for what it has done to other nations?

998
01:38:21,563 --> 01:38:24,858
It won't be an eye for an eye.

999
01:38:26,193 --> 01:38:27,235
No.

1000
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:41,083
I'd never want to leave Germany.

1001
01:38:43,043 --> 01:38:45,087
My parents
and my brothers and sisters.

1002
01:38:47,798 --> 01:38:48,923
You...

1003
01:38:50,675 --> 01:38:52,762
It was always so lovely,

1004
01:38:53,762 --> 01:38:56,515
in the evening after dinner,

1005
01:38:56,973 --> 01:38:59,477
to stroll along the Danube
with our father.

1006
01:39:02,813 --> 01:39:05,148
He would listen to our opinions

1007
01:39:06,817 --> 01:39:09,362
and then offer his opposing view.

1008
01:39:12,197 --> 01:39:16,452
I think the five of us were all better
at thinking and verbalizing

1009
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,913
when we talked with our father
than we usually were.

1010
01:39:32,467 --> 01:39:34,845
When Hitler started his re-armament program,

1011
01:39:36,430 --> 01:39:38,807
Father said right away:
"There will be a war."

1012
01:39:40,225 --> 01:39:42,560
"Those who have weapons
will use them."

1013
01:39:47,817 --> 01:39:49,192
You know, Else...

1014
01:39:51,487 --> 01:39:53,113
wherever I was,

1015
01:39:54,948 --> 01:39:57,827
I always looked forward to home
more than words could say.

1016
01:39:58,743 --> 01:40:00,120
Downright childish!

1017
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:04,792
And in every unpleasant situation

1018
01:40:05,417 --> 01:40:07,878
I always had the feeling
that it would pass.

1019
01:40:10,422 --> 01:40:11,423
And...

1020
01:40:12,132 --> 01:40:13,883
you dear people!

1021
01:40:14,885 --> 01:40:17,428
If you knew what I was going to do.

1022
01:40:23,393 --> 01:40:25,520
And now I have to hurt

1023
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,023
my family's feelings...

1024
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:34,112
so very much.

1025
01:40:39,367 --> 01:40:40,618
2 a.m.

1026
01:40:53,132 --> 01:40:56,968
Let her sleep!
Isn't that enough already?

1027
01:41:17,948 --> 01:41:19,115
5 a.m.

1028
01:41:40,762 --> 01:41:41,972
Day 5.

1029
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:46,477
Monday, the 22nd of February, 1943.

1030
01:41:46,685 --> 01:41:47,853
Sophie?

1031
01:41:50,813 --> 01:41:52,023
Sophie!

1032
01:41:56,027 --> 01:41:58,155
Time to get up.

1033
01:42:03,285 --> 01:42:04,495
7 a.m.

1034
01:42:07,497 --> 01:42:08,582
Thank you.

1035
01:42:10,583 --> 01:42:13,295
Good morning, Else.
- Good morning, Sophie.

1036
01:42:13,712 --> 01:42:15,422
Did you sleep well?

1037
01:42:16,088 --> 01:42:17,548
I always do.

1038
01:42:31,813 --> 01:42:33,815
Goodbye.

1039
01:42:34,900 --> 01:42:36,067
Yes, Philip.

1040
01:42:37,110 --> 01:42:39,070
Goodbye.

1041
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:23,990
They're coming to get you.

1042
01:43:42,342 --> 01:43:44,595
Let's say our goodbyes.

1043
01:43:55,688 --> 01:43:57,857
Please tell my parents...

1044
01:43:59,275 --> 01:44:01,235
If I'm not able to...
- Yes.

1045
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:04,322
In a calmer time,
I'll tell your parents

1046
01:44:04,488 --> 01:44:07,033
how well we got along these past few days.

1047
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:10,203
Thank you.

1048
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,887
Thank heavens I met you here!

1049
01:44:36,688 --> 01:44:38,607
God be with you, dear Sophie.

1050
01:44:38,982 --> 01:44:40,942
I'll always think of you.

1051
01:44:52,953 --> 01:44:54,163
9 a.m.

1052
01:45:51,388 --> 01:45:52,597
2 p.m.

1053
01:45:57,060 --> 01:45:58,103
Yes?

1054
01:46:00,938 --> 01:46:01,940
Yes.

1055
01:46:03,023 --> 01:46:04,902
As expected.

1056
01:46:08,947 --> 01:46:11,450
All three are sentenced to death.

1057
01:46:11,825 --> 01:46:13,577
By beheading.

1058
01:46:15,995 --> 01:46:17,372
By...

1059
01:46:19,792 --> 01:46:21,250
Guillotine.

1060
01:46:23,212 --> 01:46:25,088
Good, clean young people!

1061
01:46:26,338 --> 01:46:27,840
Traitors.

1062
01:46:28,842 --> 01:46:30,218
Oh, well.

1063
01:47:14,637 --> 01:47:15,805
Mr. Mahr?

1064
01:47:18,392 --> 01:47:19,433
Mr. Mahr!

1065
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:21,937
Is it...

1066
01:47:23,438 --> 01:47:25,398
Is it really true?

1067
01:47:26,525 --> 01:47:28,568
All three have to die?

1068
01:47:46,377 --> 01:47:49,422
Think of her in half an hour.

1069
01:47:51,048 --> 01:47:53,050
Then it will be over.

1070
01:48:01,142 --> 01:48:02,768
Unlock...

1071
01:48:02,935 --> 01:48:04,938
Unlock my cell!

1072
01:48:59,408 --> 01:49:00,702
Lord...

1073
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:11,880
Christ, take pity on her.

1074
01:49:19,678 --> 01:49:22,515
Lord, have mercy on her.

1075
01:50:09,770 --> 01:50:11,815
FREEDOM

1076
01:50:17,487 --> 01:50:20,698
On April 20th, 1943,
at the Hartwimmer-Olschewski trial,

1077
01:50:21,157 --> 01:50:25,620
I was sentenced to a year and a quarter
in prison

1078
01:50:26,078 --> 01:50:29,040
with credit for time served
in pre-trial custody.

1079
01:50:31,167 --> 01:50:36,255
My brother was executed at Berlin-Plötzensee
on May 30th, 1944.

1080
01:50:39,592 --> 01:50:43,638
I subsequently visited the parents
of Sophie and Hans Scholl

1081
01:50:44,138 --> 01:50:47,100
and told them about my encounter with Sophie.
