1
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:16,016
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,025
(dramatic music)

3
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:14,308
>> No one took
the environment seriously,

4
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:16,177
until it was too late.

5
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,814
Food, water and air

6
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,684
were poisoned by
the years of pollution.

7
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:28,322
Most people died
of disease and hunger.

8
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,893
The rich people moved
underground, where it was safe.

9
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,596
Everyone else was left behind.

10
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:38,466
Killers and criminals
formed ruthless gangs.

11
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:41,068
When they weren't
fighting each other.

12
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,271
They were trying to
break into the underworld.

13
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:45,306
To steal our food and water.

14
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,177
That's where I come in.

15
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,078
I work for a TC Unit.

16
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,080
Tracker communicator.

17
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,517
An elite division of the
underworld security forces.

18
00:01:57,685 --> 00:02:00,020
Our job was to
track the breakers.

19
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:03,056
To kick them out
or terminate them.

20
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:08,829
>> Jason, looks like
there's trouble

21
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:10,431
with the protective forcefield.

22
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,301
>> Shoot this Zoey and let's
get the hell out of here.

23
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,069
>> Copy. Stand by to record.

24
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:24,512
>> I had a laser decoder
a high voltage demobilizer.

25
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:27,181
And a rookie partner named
Zoey Kinsella.

26
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:30,284
>> Entrance granted, Unit 22.

27
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,620
>> Her father
helped form the underworld

28
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,555
before he was murdered.

29
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:37,525
I was sure she was going to
get my ass clipped,

30
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,560
but she was cool.

31
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:44,332
>> Man, is it hot up there
or what?

32
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,202
>> It's just one big
frying pan out there.

33
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:49,837
>> Hey, Henshaw, Dale.

34
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,838
>> You're late.

35
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,806
>> We're lucky we made
it here at all.

36
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,375
>> My heart bleeds.

37
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:55,909
Would you rather have
the night shift?

38
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:58,646
>> Aw geez, I don't know
what do you think, Jason?

39
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,348
>> Tough call.

40
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:03,784
Relaxing night off
or surface world at night.

41
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:05,986
>> Keep your eyes open guys.

42
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,422
>> Hey, it's a jungle out there.

43
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,528
>> Exit granted, Unit 99.

44
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,599
>> Let's hope
it's a quiet night.

45
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,434
>> Uh, what I'd give
for a cup of coffee

46
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:23,203
and a fresh doughnut about now.

47
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:25,439
>> Look out.
>> Yaah!

48
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,576
>> Control. Unit 99,
we're under attack.

49
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,043
Transition Gate 11.

50
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,712
Send back up.

51
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,414
>> Yaah!

52
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,386
(dramatic music)

53
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,389
>> Attention!
Code 3 Security alert.

54
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:44,758
Repeat!
Code 3 Security alert.

55
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,794
Breaker attack in progress.

56
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:50,197
All available TC Units,
stand by.
>> Aw shit.

57
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,533
>> Yeah, so much for
a relaxing night off, huh.
>> Tell me about it.

58
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,934
>> Unit 22.

59
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,403
Security breach at Transition...

60
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:59,440
(dramatic music)

61
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:03,043
>> Yaah!

62
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,278
>> Aah!

63
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:05,946
>> Sparks, this is
Storm and Kinsella

64
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,215
we're tracking, let's go.
>> Yeah, let's do it.

65
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,451
>> Confirmed 22,
be careful out there.

66
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,119
You're outnumbered.

67
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:16,089
(dramatic music)

68
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:18,125
>> Look out behind you.
>> Yaah!

69
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,829
(dramatic music)

70
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:22,863
>> Yaah!

71
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:24,498
>> Aah!

72
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:27,768
>> Control. ETA
Transition Gate one minute.

73
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,574
(dramatic music)

74
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,808
>> Aah!

75
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:39,980
(dramatic music)

76
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,015
>> Fry 'em.
>> Aah!

77
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,452
>> Aah!

78
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:46,487
>> Entrance denied.

79
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,491
>> Go through the gate.
>> Jam it.

80
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:55,028
>> Entrance granted, Unit 99.

81
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:58,332
(dramatic music)

82
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:01,268
>> They're getting through
at Sub-level 3.

83
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,304
They must be getting through
at the food storage centres.

84
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,808
>> Sparks,
Storm and Kinsella here.

85
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,711
We're tracking 2 breakers into
Quadrant X17.

86
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,112
Request????

87
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,748
No back up required, yet.

88
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,322
(dramatic music)

89
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,301
>> TC Unit 22
this is Control.

90
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,036
What is your status, over?

91
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,337
>> Control Unit 22

92
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:40,908
We have requested X17, Y42
unit with slip solo.

93
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:42,910
>> Go that way.
>> I'll take the big guy.

94
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:44,945
>> Take care of
yourself partner.
>> You too.

95
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,019
>> Yah!
(grunting)

96
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,454

(grunting)

102
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,409

00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,349

00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:45,973
Oh shit.

>> Yaah!

116
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,009
Back to surface world
for you chump.

117
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,479
>> Unit 22,
Kinsella has breaker in custody.

118
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:28,115
>> Ditto partner. Now let's get
these breakers topside.

119
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,550
>> You got it.

120
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:36,423
>> Attention!
Return to Security status 6.
>> Hi.

121
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,426
>> Breakers have been
apprehended and contained.

(background chatter)

123
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:44,064
Please return
to Security status 6.

124
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,301
>> Hey Sparks.

125
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:49,770
>> Job's done Sparks.

126
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:53,440
>> Controller wants to
see you two. Nice work.

127
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,675
(beeping)

128
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,644
(beeping)

129
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:57,645
>> Thanks.

130
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:58,879
(beeping)

131
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,484
(heavy footsteps)

132
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,088
>> Bigelow, Bales out.

133
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:14,194
>> How the hell
did the breakers get in?

134
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:17,230
>> They used the dead bodies
of Dale and Henshaw.

135
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:20,333
>> Shit!
>> Man this shit is ridiculous.

136
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:21,969
>> You know, someone
is feeding the breakers

137
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,503
our exact schedules.

138
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,372
>> I know, it's bad,

139
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:27,841
but I'm looking into it,
personally.

140
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,577
Meanwhile, we've got to
keep our patrols up

141
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,845
or the breakers
will be all over us.

142
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,315
Sparks send him in here.

143
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,184
>> He's on his way, sir.

144
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:39,553
>> So what have you found today?

145
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:42,690
>> Well we recorded a variety
of topographical locations.

146
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:45,092
And when you match it to
Jason's gathering chips,

147
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,160
I think you just might find,
that Mother Nature's

148
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,763
working on a remedy
for the lack of ozone.

149
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,532
>> I wouldn't be
to sure about that.

150
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,435
Cameron,
I'd like you to meet

151
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,571
Zoey Kinsella
and Jason Storm.

152
00:08:57,605 --> 00:09:00,107
The two best trackers
that we have.

153
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,508
Cameron Johnson.

154
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,043
>> We've met before.

155
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,311
>> How could I forget.

156
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,748
You spent a year putting word
viruses in my computer program.

157
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:11,184
Dr. Cameron was my Cybernetics,
Professor at the University.

158
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:14,421
until he left to go to
med school at what was it, 14?

159
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,424
>> So I suppose, he was
captain of the football team?

160
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:20,728
>> Well, we're on
the same team now.

161
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,631
Cameron is going to analyze
the data, that you bring me.

162
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:26,734
To see how it
interfaces with our new

163
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,369
TC project,
on surface world.

164
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,105
>> TC2000X's actually.

165
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,306
>> 2000X.

166
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,076
>> Yeah. Cybernetic trackers.
>> Uh-mmh!

167
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,145
>> Nice to know you can
always be replaced.

168
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,648
>> Well, I wouldn't
worry about that.

169
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,651
We haven't had a lot of
volunteers for this project.

170
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:46,153
>> Well if it means
moving to surface world

171
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,288
you won't find me signing up.

172
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,091
>> Oh that surveillance camera
at the Communications Centre

173
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,626
it just looks like
a standard bred camera

174
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,727
protect it's force field.

175
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,362
>> Thanks Zoey.

176
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,568
Sparks, scramble Unit 13.
Communication Center.

177
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,904
>> A pair of
surveillance cameras.

178
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:04,905
>> Aw fuck.

179
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,940
>> You little prick.

180
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:09,476
>> I doubt if you can
start days Lonnie,

181
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,844
>> Yeah, nice assignment.

182
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:12,680
Dale and Henshaw just got
fucking smoked

183
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,915
coming through that
Transition Gate.
>> Shit.

184
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,583
>> It's been really
scary out there.

185
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,152
>> Fucking Controller, someone
should ship his ass up there.

186
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:20,253
>> Watch what you say Trix.

187
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,189
>> Hey, the Controllers,
right hand man.

188
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,456
>> Hey.

189
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,861
>> Back off Bigelow.

190
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,598
>> See you in the gym, tracker.

191
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,767
>> All right, you two,
you know, the rules.

192
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:35,969
Our enemies are
the criminals of surface world

193
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:37,705
not each other.

194
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:39,639
When trackers and guards
have problems

195
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:42,109
they sort them out here
in the gym.

196
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,143
Anything goes.

197
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,444
>> Come on.

198
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,481
(colleagues yelling)

199
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,853
>> Jason. Come on Jason.

200
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,689
>> Yaah!

201
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,627
Yaah!

202
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,664
(colleagues yelling)

203
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,110
>> Aah!

204
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:22,582
>> Come on Jason,
you can do it.

205
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,051
>> Aah!

206
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:25,853
(grunting)

207
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,287
>> Yeah, yeah.

208
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,090
>> Ooh!

209
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,551
(colleagues yelling)

210
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,238
>> Get him Jason.

211
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,746
(colleagues yelling)

212
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,824
>> Attention all tracker units
and guards.

213
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:40,693
Please report for night shift
detail at 19:00 hours.

214
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,767
(colleagues yelling)

215
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,970
>> Aah!
>> Come on.

216
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,338
>> Come on, break it up.
>> That's enough.

217
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,206
>> Come on, be brave.

218
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,742
>> Ooh, aah.

219
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,177
>> Take it easy.

220
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,816
>> Word is you took care
of Bigelow.

221
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,684
>> Yeah, I taught him
a thing or two.

222
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:06,954
He'd be out of commission
for a long time.

223
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,956
(Kinsella laughing)

224
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,291
>> Well I doubt the Controller's
going to be to happy about it.

225
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,961
>> Yeah, well I'm not to happy
with the Controller.

226
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,629
He shouldn't hire guards
like Bigelow.

227
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,699
>> You know,
I was just thinking.

228
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,468
>> Thinking.

229
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,703
Not about
the surface world again.

230
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,308
Quit playing with that thing
it's making me nervous, okay.

231
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,610
>> My dad said,
"Never to take it off."

232
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,013
>> But he never told you
what it was for.

233
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,848
>> Right.

234
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:37,284
>> So it must not be a key
to a buried treasure.

235
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,718
>> Maybe.

236
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,823
(jazz music)

237
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,828
What do you really think
is going on up there?

238
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:53,033
>> You know, you like this
every time we come back.

239
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,067
Can't you relax?

240
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:56,003
>> Look who's talking.

241
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:57,504
>> You keep fooling around
with that data crap

242
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,339
stuff's going to
get you in trouble.

243
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:02,675
>> You have to admit things
are starting to grow up there.

244
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:03,843
>> Yeah, for gangs.

245
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:07,014
>> Somebody could be
making it easier for them.

246
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,082
I think there's a leak
in the security system.

247
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,351
>> Zoey, leave it alone.

248
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,386
Try some of my mussel pasta.

249
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:16,856
>> No thanks.

250
00:14:17,557 --> 00:14:21,194
I am going to go
and try to figure this out.

251
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,663
It's driving me crazy.

252
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,832
>> Well the Controller's
not stupid.

253
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,600
>> I know.

254
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,202
>> Be careful, okay.

255
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,703
>> I will.

256
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,505
Enjoy your dinner.
>> Thank you.

257
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,374
>> It looks really good.

258
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,944
>> I knew she was right.

259
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:39,913
Maybe the Controller was
keeping something from us,

260
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:42,115
could this go right to the top.

261
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,018
Our Overlord, seemed like
a decent leader.

262
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:47,587
But maybe he didn't know
anything about this.

263
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,256
>> Controller,
Master Sumai

264
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:52,459
has been located on
surface world, Monitor 7.

265
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,893
Should I dispatch
a tracking unit.

266
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,695
>> No that won't be
necessary, Sparks.

267
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,064
Sumai poses no immediate threat,

268
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,699
but keep me posted,
as to his whereabouts.

269
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,035
You keep killing yourself off
surface scum.

270
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,703
Less for me to do later.

271
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:07,740
(crowd cheering)

272
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,922
(dramatic music)

273
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,941
>> Aah! Aah!

274
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,950
(crowd cheering)

275
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,956
(dramatic music)

276
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,960
(crowd booing)

277
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:12,972
>> Aaah!

278
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,649
>> Welcome!

279
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,018
Friends. To my humble home.

280
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:26,619
We have much to celebrate.

281
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:27,854
Blade.

282
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,590
Let's hear some music.

283
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,566
(record spinning on turntable)

284
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,868
That's nice, that's nice.

285
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:45,172
Picasso, the time has come
for surface world to reclaim

286
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:46,839
what's rightfully ours.

287
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:49,042
And defeat
the underworld forces.

288
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:51,711
We may now penetrate their
underground sanctuaries,

289
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,381
with this a trackers PDR.

290
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,383
A gift from the enemy.

291
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,984
(crowd cheering)

292
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,820
So let's party boys.

293
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:06,426
(crowd cheering)

294
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,461
>> Long live the Picasso.

295
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:15,001
>> TC Unit 13,
this is Control.

296
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,670
What is your status, over?

297
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,006
>> Control, Flannigan
and Zimicks here

298
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,008
we've reached
the Communications Centre.

299
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,743
The protected force field
surveillance camera

300
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,512
Section 6 & 7 tied.

301
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,347
The tech's working on
restoring power now.

302
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,084
>> What is your
ETR Unit 13, over?

303
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:35,222
>> Estimated completion
of repairs at 24:00 hours, over.

304
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:40,093
>> Ah, Zircon a shame to waste
a bottle of this great stuff

305
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:43,730
it would make
for a fine evening.

306
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:49,569
Sometimes I guess, we have to
make sacrifices, don't we.

307
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,238
Death to the under world.

308
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,273
>> Aah!

309
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:58,445
Aah!
>> We're under attack.

310
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,947
>> We're under attack. We need
back up. One man's down.

311
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,183
We're need
a MedEvac immediately.

312
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,588
(dramatic music)

313
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:09,722
>> Help!

314
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,159
Help me.
Somebody help me.

315
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:14,694
>> Yah!

316
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:23,503
(dramatic music)

317
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,707
>> Kiai!

318
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,943
(grunting)

319
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:35,482
>> Kiai!

320
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:39,519
(dramatic music)

321
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,955
Bring the bodies to
the Transition gate.

322
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,957
And be quick.

323
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,093
>> Come on, let's go.

324
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:51,130
(dramatic music)

325
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,244
>> You're mine tracker.

326
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,979
>> Entrance granted.

327
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,515
(explosion)

328
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:09,716
>> Aah!

329
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:11,751
>> Entrance denied.

330
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:20,293
>> Come on, bring the bodies
before they freeze the gates.

331
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,161
Hurry up, Blade

332
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,531

333
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:25,532
(computer keys clacking)

334

>> 7,10 and 22.

338
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:38,745
What does the monitor say?

339
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,413
>> Well, Niki Picasso.

340
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:41,448
>> Hello!

341
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:45,218
(tracker PDR beeping)

342
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,190

00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:41,574
Come on.
our mission awaits us.

346
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:51,751
>> All right.
Let's get these guys.

347
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,254
(dramatic music)

348
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,224
>> Okay, Unit 2,
take tunnel 105

349
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,259
remember I'm behind you.

350
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,795
>> Good. Camera 45 Y14

351
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,298
and they definitely
know their way around.

352
00:21:05,332 --> 00:21:08,301
>> Okay Unit 17 high side
Tunnel 104, right flank.

353
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:10,002
>> They're not headed
for the reservoir,

354
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:11,671
where are they going?

355
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,475

>> Let's ask these gentlemen
to cool off the hijackers

360
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:37,897
and give us a hand.

361
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:43,370
>> Attention!
Code 1 Security alert.

362
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:44,804
>> They've breached
the tunnel access code

363
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,205
they're into Quadrant 13.

364
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:47,340
>> Alert the trackers.

365
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:51,110
>> Attention TC Units 7 and 22
this is Control.

366
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,145
Breakers have entered into
the main frame quadrant

367
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,381
they're into Quadrant 13.

368
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,015
>> God, they must have got
Unit 10.

369
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,385
>> It's the only way,
they could have gotten in, damn.

370
00:21:58,418 --> 00:21:59,419
(panel beeping)

371
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,525
(dramatic music)

372
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:07,193
Control, they're heading
to the reservoir.

373
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,462
Correction, they've turned north
Quadrant 36.

374
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,330
>> They've got a plan.

375
00:22:13,232 --> 00:22:15,134
>> What the hell
this is a dead end.

376
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,369
>> Wait!

377
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:20,239
What are they doing?

378
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,344
(dramatic music)

379
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,382
(glass panel shattering)

380
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,150
>> What is it?

381
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:34,020
>> Entry by unauthorized
personnel is...

382
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:36,322
>> Control this is
Storm and Kinsella.
>> ...forbidden, repeat.

383
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,725
we just chased the breakers into
what appears to be a dead end.

384
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:40,993
>> What the hell
is going on, Sparks?

385
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,530
>> My apologies 22,
we're working on it.

386
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:45,732
>> Additional trackers units
have been dispatched.

387
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:47,033
Please stand by.

388
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,701
(panel beeping)

389
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:49,936
>> There we are.

390
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:51,671
(panel beeping)

391
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:53,105
Follow me!

392
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,612
>> What are your
precise coordinates 22?

393
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:03,483
>> Okay Control.
We're at East 47, North 52.

394
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:07,620
>> North 52,
nobody's been there for years.

395
00:23:07,654 --> 00:23:09,221
They're right under us.

396
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,857
Where's the Controller?

397
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,358
>> Anything I can help you with?

398
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,194
>> No! Proceed with caution.

399
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,063
>> No kidding, come on.

400
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:22,469
>> Attention!
This quadrant is restricted.

401
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:26,939
Entry by unauthorized personnel
is not permitted.

402
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:28,608
>> Something's wrong Zoey.

403
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,276
Why in the hell
would a breaker risk his life

404
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:31,578
to enter a dead zone?

405
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,713
>> Doesn't make any sense.

406
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,483
This place doesn't even
show up on our maps.

407
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:38,751
How do they know that
and yet we don't?

408
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,469
(grunting)

409
00:23:57,837 --> 00:24:01,107
>> Trackers, looks like...

410
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,909
it's time to die.

411
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,777
>> It's time to get a new watch.

412
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:09,281
(dramatic music)

413
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:17,423
(grunting)

414
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,826
(dramatic music)

415
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,293
>> Aah!

416
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,863
>> Aah!

417
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,301
>> Yaah! Yaah!

418
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,478
(yelling)

419
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:50,489
(fighting sequence)
(dramatic music)

420
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:10,509
(fighting sequence)
(dramatic music)

421
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:20,820
>> Ah, what a beauty

422
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,856
he didn't let me down.
(laughing cynically)

423
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,925
Surprise!

424
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,897
(gun firing)

425
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,932
>> Aah!
>> Shit!

426
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,401
>> Come on Zoey, let's go.
>> Get that gun,
let's get outta here.

427
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:37,904
>> I've got this.
(gun firing)

428
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:40,573
>> Unit 22, this is Control,
do you read?

429
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:42,074
>> Control this is
Storm and Kinsella

430
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:43,509
we're under fire,
send some back up.

431
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,546
(gun firing)

432
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,885
>> Control, he's shooting at us,
send back up.

433
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,522
(gun firing)

434
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,524
Repeat, send back up.

435
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,259
(alarm beeping)

436
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,360
Control, come in.

437
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,795
(alarm beeping)

438
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:04,163
(gun firing)

439
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,365
(dramatic music)

440
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,367
(gun firing)
We're trapped.

441
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,802
I have an idea.

442
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,372
(dramatic music)

443
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,008
(gun firing)

444
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,747
(gun firing)

445
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,414
>> Noooo!

446
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,583
>> Aah!

447
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:30,589
(somber music)

448
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,792
>> Zoey.

449
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,827
>> It's okay.

450
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,964
They're bullets.

451
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:40,332
>> Zoey, Zoey hold on.

452
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:42,969
Don't talk, save your strength.

453
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:44,570
>> You lied to me Jason,

454
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,438
you said,
we'd be partners forever.

455
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:49,876
>> Zoey, we are partners,
partners forever.

456
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,778
Zoey.

457
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,014
Zoey.

458
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,785
Zoey.

459
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:05,457
Noo!

460
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:11,130
>> Why do you want her
at Terminal sStation anyway?

461
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,700
>> Never mind that,
just answer my question.

462
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:16,669
Can we program her
to do whatever I want?

463
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:19,038
>> Certainly, if you want her
to take on the Lifers at

464
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:21,140
the turning station,
she'll do it.

465
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,541
No questions asked.

466
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,476
She may require some assistance

467
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,979
but I can program her to be
very resourceful.

468
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,647
>> And they have to be dead?

469
00:27:28,681 --> 00:27:32,885
>> Clinically, for the radical
neuro-restructuring.

470
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:34,453
>> Well do you
erase her memory?

471
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,123
>> To dangerous.

472
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,558
No one will figure out how to
access the memory.

473
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,695
>> No one!

474
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:43,930
(Cameron snickering)

475
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,800
Well it's not exactly what
the Overlord had in mind,

476
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,668
but what the hell.

477
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:55,341
Now let's see about
getting her partner back.

478
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:00,679
(dramatic music)

479
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:07,887
>> Remember, you're my woman
and I tell you what to do.
>> Let her go.

480
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,321
Get out of the way kid.

481
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:12,391
And when I say it,
you'll do a dance.

482
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,261
Come on.

483
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:18,364
(woman screaming)

484
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,800
You'll do as I say,
or I'll be...

485
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,938
(dramatic music)

486
00:28:25,972 --> 00:28:27,940
You there,

487
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:32,812
interfere in my work
and I'll tear your head off.

488
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:40,552
(fighting sequence)
(dramatic music)

489
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:46,325
>> Aah!

490
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:55,267
(giant yelling)

491
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:56,735
Come here you.

492
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:01,340
(grunting)

493
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:05,978
>> Yaah!

494
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:10,783
Yaah!

495
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:15,487
Yaah!

496
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:16,956
>> Yaah!

497
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,160
Bah!

498
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,896
Bah!
(groaning)

499
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,897
>> Aah!

500
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:26,332
>> Yeeah!

501
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,801
Yeeah!

502
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,941
Yeeah!
(laughing)

503
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:37,576
(fighting sequence)
(dramatic music)

504
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,811
>> Yaah!

505
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:40,612
Yaah!

506
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:49,388
Yaah!

507
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,830
>> Aah!

508
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,167
(dramatic music)

509
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,970
(boy screaming)

510
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:06,005
>> Get outta here.

511
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:07,874
Just you and me.

512
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,246
>> Yaah!

513
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,952
>> Come on little man, I'll show
you who's big and tough

514
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:21,053
but it sure ain't you.

515
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:24,390
Come on get me,
come on and play my game.

516
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:27,426
>> Aah!
(wall shattering)

517
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,339
>> Enhance 3 times.

518
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:56,722
A PDR,
that's strictly TC issued.

519
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:59,191
Shit! They have an access code.

520
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:01,193
They had help from the inside.

521
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:02,828
Zoey, you were right.

522
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,863
They sold us out.

523
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,037
>> The soul is that we can
commit to the elements

524
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:15,707
the body of our sister
Zoey Kinsella dear departed.

525
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,345
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
and dust to dust

526
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,613
but in sure and certain hope

527
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:24,650
of the Resurrection
to eternal life.

528
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,119
>> Sorry Jason.

529
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,925
>> We'll miss her.

530
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:35,427
>> My condolences.

531
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:55,381
>> Her father and I worked on
a lot of projects together

532
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,316
before we moved underground.

533
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:00,953
It seems like Zoey's always
been a part of my life.

534
00:32:00,987 --> 00:32:02,621
If there's anything
I can do Jason?

535
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,824
>> I would like to see her
one more time if I can.

536
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,759
>> That's out of my hands.

537
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:10,729
Her body's the property of
the security council now.

538
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,765
>> That property used to be
my partner for 10 years.

539
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:19,538
>> Her chips, her access codes
they've all got to be removed.

540
00:32:20,206 --> 00:32:21,473
Like all trackers

541
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:24,076
she is now listed
as classified information.

542
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,312
Well, that's fucked.

543
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:29,281
Breakers have access to
classified info and we don't.

544
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:30,516
>> What?

545
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:33,485
>> Zoey recorded our last run

546
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,921
the breakers had a PDR
with an access code on it.

547
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,656
>> Does anybody else
know about this?

548
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:38,924
>> No.

549
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,793
But I'm not sticking around to
see someone else, get greased.

550
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:44,363
>> You want to quit?

551
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,932
You want out?

552
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,534
Fine.

553
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,836
Report for total deprogramming.

554
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,304
Right now.

555
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:56,375
(dramatic music)

556
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:04,016
>> If you know
what's good for you,

557
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,951
get the hell out of here.

558
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,487
Prepare to remove his homing
system, directions finder

559
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,222
and access chips.

560
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:11,423
Cardiac monitor?

561
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:13,725
>> I'm running a cardiac doctor
but it can't be perceived.

562
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,394
ECG normal.
>> Blood pressure?

563
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:16,862
>> 130 over 70.

564
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:19,798
>> Set up for an art line.
>> Right away.

565
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,233
(coughing)

566
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,012
(coughing)

567
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:39,718
>> So many died.

568
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:42,754
>> What the hell,
Jason Storm is still alive?

569
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:43,855
Why didn't you take care of him

570
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,924
in the deprogramming room
like I told you?

571
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:47,593
>> There was
too many people around.

572
00:33:47,626 --> 00:33:48,994
Besides, I can ruin my career.

573
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,862
Screw your career.

574
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:52,564
You work for me now.

575
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:55,000
Bigelow, you get
your boys on him

576
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,868
and don't you screw up.

577
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,646
(knocking on door)

578
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:11,250
>> Storm, Storm
we've got you now.

579
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:13,285
Storm, Storm open up.

580
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,090
(banging on door)

581
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,259
(door bursting open)

582
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,894
>> Yaah!

583
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,869
(glass shattering)

584
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:31,903
Yaah!

585
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:39,044
Yaah!

586
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,912
>> Aww!
>> Yaah!

587
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,921
>> Yaah!

588
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:56,562
>> There he is.

589
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,197
>> Oh shit!

590
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:07,673
>> Hey shit!

591
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,679
Damn man!
We're dead meat.

592
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:15,347
>> No, he's dead meat.

593
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,951
(grunting)

594
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,094
>> Attention!

595
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,931
Fugitive at large
in Sector 4.

596
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,100
Apprehend immediately.

597
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:39,738
Authorize and identify
all unsanctioned personnel.

598
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:47,145
(dramatic music)

599
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:54,119
>> Trackers, Jason Storm

600
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,755
has defected to
the surface world.

601
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:00,726
This poses
a significant security risk.

602
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:03,229
And I have
further information

603
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:07,065
that confirms Jason
orchestrated the break in

604
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:10,135
that resulted in
Zoey Kinsella's death.

605
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,403
>> Nah, he wouldn't do that.

606
00:36:11,437 --> 00:36:14,873
>> Jason Storm is a traitor
and must be apprehended.

607
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:22,180
(dramatic music)

608
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:52,378
>> Do you want to
see the sights?

609
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,813
You've got to pay the price.

610
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:59,285
Give me your bag,
pretty boy.

611
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:02,120
And I'll let you live.
(laughing)

612
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:04,189
>> Back off, rat face.

613
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,057
I've had a hard day.

614
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:10,796
(dramatic music)

615
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:12,264
>> Yah!

616
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,266
>> Yaah!

617
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,602
(grunting)

618
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:17,836
Yaah!

619
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:27,846
Yaah!

620
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:36,655
(dramatic music)

621
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:49,868
>> Get up!

622
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,479
>> Yaah!

623
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,649
>> Come on.

624
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:04,883
>> Awwh!

625
00:38:10,188 --> 00:38:11,823
>> Freeze him.

626
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:23,301
(dramatic music)

627
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,978

(whimpering)

630
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:46,392
(heavy footsteps)

631
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:48,159
>> Members of the press,

632
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:50,462
we've always been committed
to the safety of those

633
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:52,831
who live here in underworld.

634
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:57,168
We are increasingly concerned by
the unrest and lawlessness

635
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:58,870
coming from above.

636
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:00,539
We are under attack.

637
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:02,974
And we must fight back.

638
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:05,176
I present to you
a scientific marvel

639
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,845
which will ensure
your protection

640
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:08,714
for the coming century.

641
00:39:09,615 --> 00:39:12,584
80 percent human
20 percent machine

642
00:39:12,618 --> 00:39:16,054
and 100 percent
dedicated to its mission.

643
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,924
Ladies and gentlemen

644
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:20,426
I give to you

645
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:24,530
the TC2000X.

646
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:28,567
(clapping)

647
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,804
>> Grand master.

(clapping and cheering)

652
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,740
Are there anymore of you
where you come from?

653
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:10,976
>> Over here.
>> Get a close up shot.

654
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,110
>> Can you come this way please.

655
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,546
>> Hey TC,
who's the next model?

656
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,583
>> 2000, what 20 percent
of you is not human?

657
00:40:19,017 --> 00:40:20,118
(cameras clicking)

658
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,787
>> Zoey, I have to kill you.

(gun firing)

660
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:25,290
>> Cybernetic Trackers.

661
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:27,459
Controller you're making
a mistake.

00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:29,795
(murmuring)

663
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:31,396
You're the key Zoey.

00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:39,437
(exotic music)

666
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:50,015
>> Hey big boy.

667
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:52,050
Looking for a good time?

668
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:56,021

>> The time for betting is over
the time for fighting is now.
>> Yeah!

671
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:11,670
>> Our challenger tonight
has the speed of the jaguar

672
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:14,305
the strength of the rhino

673
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,942
sting of the scorpion.

674

He's known throughout
the territory

677

for his skills and cunning,
he's a survivour.

678
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:38,063
Master of all
who come before him

the reigning champion

680
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:41,867

It will be the greatest
prize we have to offer.

684
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:00,852
The two that have entered here
only one may leave.

685
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:01,887
Kari.

let's get
this traitor out of here.

He helps me, I help him.

726
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:10,568
Far as I'm concerned,
we're even.

727
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,603
He wishes to
thank you anyway.

728
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:18,209
>> How did you
end up with that?

729
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:22,413
That belongs to you, you know,
you would have won the fight.

730
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:25,650
But I accept something a little
more precious than water.

731
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:27,685
And that's information.

732
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:30,588
I'm looking for a guy
with a painting on his face.

733
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,457
>> Niki Picasso.

734
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:34,926
>> That sounds like
the man that fits his face.

735
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,795
>> There are very few who do not
know of Niki Picasso.

736
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,432
>> What of Niki?

737
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:44,435
>> He killed my partner
and that's why I'm here.

738
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,104
>> He has
terrorized us for years.

739
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,839
>> Why hasn't someone
stopped him?

740
00:46:47,873 --> 00:46:50,876
Sumai, you're a great warrior,
why haven't you taken him on?

741
00:46:50,909 --> 00:46:52,343
>> I am one man.

742
00:46:52,377 --> 00:46:54,012
>> Niki's stand is many.

743
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:55,646
>> Well then,
let's go play his game.

744
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,183
Let's go round up some good
fighters and go kick his ass.

745
00:46:58,216 --> 00:47:01,352
>> Only the Lifers will
stand up to Niki Picasso.

746
00:47:01,386 --> 00:47:03,521
>> Let's go get the Lifers
and pay Niki a visit.

747
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:06,824
>> The Lifers are a brotherhood
of vicious criminals.

748
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:08,293
A closed society.

749
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,361
They protect,
Terminal Station.

750
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:11,529
>> Terminal Station.

751
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:14,499
>> Terminal Station is
a chemical warfare plant.

752
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:17,802
The population of the surface
world was to be eliminated

753
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,405
when the ozone layer
repaired itself.

754
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:22,307
>> That's insane.

755
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,076
>> So far,
it has been impenetrable.

756
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,577
There is some fear

757
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:28,980
that someone discovered
the key and activated it.

758
00:47:29,014 --> 00:47:30,048
>> Picasso?

759
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:31,716
>> Niki Picasso's
very clever but.

760
00:47:31,749 --> 00:47:35,586
>> Niki Picasso's going down
with you or without you.

761
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:38,856
>> Go by, day.

762
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,659
>> It's the only way to get
close to Niki's fortress.

763
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,029
He thinks no one is stupid
enough to go by day.

764
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:46,464
>> No one ever accused me
of being bright.

765
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:53,271
>> Now why should
I trust you?

766
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:55,840
You've been sent
by the Controller.

767
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:58,109
>> I've been programmed to
rescue surface world

768
00:47:58,143 --> 00:47:59,544
at any cost.

769
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:01,212
And you will help us.

770
00:48:01,246 --> 00:48:03,381
You have a great army
of warriors

771
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:06,717
You and the Picasso's are
the only fighters that can

772
00:48:06,751 --> 00:48:09,220
defeat the protectors
of Terminal Station.

773
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:11,289
>> It's simple.

774
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:14,759
You get me safely to
the Terminal Station's door

775
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:18,096
and the Controller will get you
whatever you want.

776
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:19,864
>> The last time
I worked with the Controller

777
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,732
I almost got my ass shot.

778
00:48:21,766 --> 00:48:25,770
>> Well this one, I will
personally guarantee it.

779
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:38,916
(wind blowing)

780
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,501
>> Sumai?

781
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:58,103
>> You're crazy to go alone.

782
00:48:58,136 --> 00:48:59,504
>> Crazy to go together.

783
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:01,339
>> But much less crazy.

784
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:04,009
In day, the Picasso sleep.

785
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:11,382
>> Let's make our way
to the tower.

786
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,954
(wind blowing)

787
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,966
>> Niki Picasso down there,
very difficult.

788
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,402
>> No problem.
Tracker School 101.

789
00:49:34,672 --> 00:49:36,207
So we have two choices Sumai,

790
00:49:36,241 --> 00:49:39,244
either I lower you
or you lower me.

791
00:49:40,245 --> 00:49:42,247
>> Don't forget to write.

792
00:49:43,748 --> 00:49:45,383
>> Wise choice.

793
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:52,990
(dramatic music)

794
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,429
(grunting)

795
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,004
(dramatic music)

796
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,256
(heavy footsteps)

797
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:32,029
(ball bouncing)

798
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:36,067
(thump on table)

799
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:53,084
>> Where is it?

800
00:50:55,653 --> 00:50:58,089
I know it's here, somewhere.

801
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:07,064
(dramatic music)

802
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:10,468
>> Yeah!

803
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:20,077
(spinning record on turn table)

804
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:23,114
Can you hear it honey?

805
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:27,685
(grunting)
(grunting)

806
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,290
>> Aah!

807
00:51:34,459 --> 00:51:36,093
>> Go back.

808
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,464
I've waited a long time
for this moment

809
00:51:39,497 --> 00:51:40,798
you killed my partner.

810
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:42,267
>> Killed who?

811
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,334
Oh no!

812
00:51:43,368 --> 00:51:45,570
>> Don't screw with me,
you sack of shit.

813
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:48,606
>> Hey, hey don't kill
the messenger of good news.

814
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:49,840
(grunting)

815
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,076
She's still alive.

816
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,078
>> Bullshit!
How do you know?

817
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,414
>> I know
much more than you think.

818
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,082
Where do you think
I got this?

819
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,950
Does this look familiar to you?

820
00:52:00,885 --> 00:52:02,987
Okay, okay
you want to see her?

821
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,023
Honey,
you got a visitor in here.

822
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:12,129
(dramatic music)

823
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:24,141
(dramatic music)

824
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:31,115
(dramatic music)

825
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:35,152
(heavy footsteps)

826
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:41,158
(dramatic music)

827
00:52:42,427 --> 00:52:43,694
>> Zoey!

828
00:52:43,728 --> 00:52:45,230
>> Easy boy.

829
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:47,265
She's a wild woman.

830
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:52,036
>> Partner!

831
00:52:54,439 --> 00:52:55,673
>> Yaah!

832
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,009
(grunting)

833
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,014
Yaah!

834
00:53:06,384 --> 00:53:08,386
(grunting)

835
00:53:12,457 --> 00:53:13,691
Yaah!

836
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:19,196
(dramatic music)

837
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:27,738
Yaah!

838
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:31,409
>> Zoey, please.
>> Yaah!

839
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,244
Yaah!

840
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:35,179
>> Zoey, stop it.

841
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,047
>> Yaah!
(grunting)

842
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:41,051
Yaah!

843
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,622
Hey!

844
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,057
(grunting)

845
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:51,228
(dramatic music)

846
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,264
(grunting)

847
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,235
(dramatic music)

848
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:00,037
>> Zoey, stop it!

849
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,205
(Picasso laughing)

850
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,440
>> Yaah!

851
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,413
(dramatic music)

852
00:54:08,446 --> 00:54:09,647
Yaah!

853
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:12,650
>> Come on Zoey.
>> Yaah!

854
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,053
(dramatic music)

855
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,221
>> Zoey, stop it!

856
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,656
(computer static)

857
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,459
>> Zoey, no I can't fight you.

858
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,630
>> What?
(computer static)

859
00:54:25,663 --> 00:54:28,232
(gun firing)

860
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,801
(computer static)
(gun firing)

861
00:54:30,835 --> 00:54:32,036
What?

862
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:34,872
(computer override)

863
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,643
(laughing)

864
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:40,445
Yaah!
(grunting)

865
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:43,247
(computer override)

866
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,482
Yaah!

867
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,585
(dramatic music)

868
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:49,454
Yaah!
(grunting)

869
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,457
>> Bye, bye Jason.

870
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:53,691
>> Yaah!

871
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:59,296
(dramatic music)

872
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:14,244
>> What the hell happened Sumai?

873
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:19,817
>> TC2000X.

874
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,986
>> You've been unconscious
for a day now.

875
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:23,488
Much has happened.

876
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:25,956
What is the benefit
of this android?

877
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:27,392
>> She's no android.

878
00:55:27,425 --> 00:55:28,959
Her name is Zoey.

879
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:30,995
She used to be my partner.

880
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:33,698
>> The Lifers
have encountered her.

881
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:36,000
>> Lifers, oh man.

882
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:38,469
If Niki gets her
to the Terminal Station

883
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:40,037
do you know what that means?

884
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:42,072
The end of surface world.

885
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,875
We got to get going.

886
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:47,244
>> Rest!

887
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:54,351
(dramatic music)

888
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:01,492
>> We'll make our move soon.

889
00:56:01,526 --> 00:56:04,061
Lifers must be surprised
that they can be defeated.

890
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,431
>> Nobody has ever
defeated the Lifers.

891
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:09,400
>> But we will Niki,
we'll kill them all.

892
00:56:09,434 --> 00:56:11,068
Enter Terminal Station

893
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:13,404
and all of surface world
will be ours.

894
00:56:13,438 --> 00:56:15,339
>> Gentlemen!

895
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,943
>> All power will be yours.

896
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:20,578
>> What the hell is going on?

897
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:23,748
Why isn't she leading him back
to the Terminal Station?

898
00:56:23,781 --> 00:56:26,751
>> She's merely
fulfilling my program.

899
00:56:26,784 --> 00:56:29,720
Love takes time.

900
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:34,024
>> Did I ask you for an android
on hormone overdrive.

901
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:35,560
Your counter-programming

902
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:38,796
could jeopardize
this whole operation.

903
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:40,097
>> She's gotten
this far hasn't she.

904
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:43,568
>> This far,
is not good enough.

905
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:47,371
Now you,
get her back on track.

906
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,139
Before the Overlord finds out

907
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:52,176
that she's even
up there, all right.

908
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:59,416
(dramatic music)

909
00:57:03,688 --> 00:57:07,424
(drums beating)
(dramatic music)

910
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:22,439
(dramatic music)

911
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:52,469
(dramatic music)

912
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:00,811
>> Is it true
the energy transfers

913
00:58:00,845 --> 00:58:02,847
power through the objects?

914
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:06,851
Will you teach me?

915
00:58:06,884 --> 00:58:08,085
>> Yes!

916
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:15,492
(dramatic music)

917
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,834
(Sumai yelling)
(watermelon smashing)

918
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:30,140
>> Sumai I can't remember
the last time I felt so great.

919
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:32,309
Feel like
I'm part of a team now.

920
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,411
I mean I'd be still
with Kinsella but...

921
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:36,881
>> Kinsella!
>> Kinsella!

922
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:38,983
>> Zoey Kinsella,
what's up?

923
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:41,719
>> A man named Bertram Kinsella
built Terminal Station.

924
00:58:41,752 --> 00:58:43,520
to replenish the atmosphere.

925
00:58:43,554 --> 00:58:46,857
Instead, it became
the ultimate weapon of death.

926
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:48,158
>> Zoey's father.

927
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:50,828
>> My father often told me
of a young girl

928
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:53,497
who was the sunshine
of this brilliant man's life.

929
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,165
Before he was murdered.

930
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,168
>> Zoey's father,
Terminal Station.

931
00:58:58,202 --> 00:59:00,370
How do you actually open up
the gate Sumai?

932
00:59:00,404 --> 00:59:02,072
>> This is still a mystery.

933
00:59:02,106 --> 00:59:04,041
>> It died with
Bertram Kinsella.

934
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:05,109
>> I don't think so.

935
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:07,511
Zoey's father
once gave her necklace.

936
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,246
>> What did it look like?

937
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,548
>> It was a child's hand
outstretched holding a...

938
00:59:11,582 --> 00:59:12,717
>> A Key.

939
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:13,951
>> Bingo!

940
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:18,388
>> There it is Niki,
Terminal Station.

941
00:59:18,422 --> 00:59:20,190
>> It's not going to be easy.

942
00:59:20,224 --> 00:59:22,693
>> Nothing worth waiting for
should be easy.

943
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:24,762
>> You're learning to play
hardball aren't you?

944
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:26,430
>> And so do I.

945
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:29,399
Ooh!

946
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:34,138
>> I got this one Niki.

947
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:35,405
Yaah!

948
00:59:37,474 --> 00:59:38,676
Yaah!

949
00:59:39,176 --> 00:59:40,210
Yaah!

950
00:59:40,244 --> 00:59:41,378
>> Aah!

951
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,748
>> We'll need all the Picassos
for this one.

952
00:59:43,781 --> 00:59:45,816
(dog barking)

953
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:49,253
>> For crying out loud,
where is she going?

954
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:52,289
Why don't you stay focused?

955
00:59:53,624 --> 00:59:55,826
>> All is working out,
I trust.

956
00:59:57,762 --> 00:59:58,963
>> Fine.

957
00:59:59,797 --> 01:00:01,098
Fine. Couldn't be better.

958
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:04,534
>> Good. Good, that's what
I like to hear.

959
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:07,304
The TC2000X,

960
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:09,473
everything's working out?

961
01:00:09,506 --> 01:00:10,908
>> Like a charm.

962
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,577
Everything is going
completely according to plan.

963
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,346
>> Yes, I can see that.

964
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,215
Let's hope it stays that way.

965
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:25,622
(dramatic music)

966
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:31,628
(training sequence)

967
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:50,647
(training sequence)

968
01:00:52,216 --> 01:00:54,618
>> I think we're ready.

969
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,053
>> To soon.

970
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:57,822
>> To soon.

971
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:04,795
Whether it's controlling Niki

972
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:06,563
or sealing up
the Terminal Station.

973
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:08,598
I'm not going to
sit around here watching.

974
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:13,570
Why don't you
guys join forces?

975
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:16,040
And try to squash
this little parasite.

976
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:19,977
>> There's a limit
to hospitality,

977
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,680
and you're coming
dangerously close.

978
01:01:23,714 --> 01:01:25,549
>> Sumai.
What are you going to do?

979
01:01:25,582 --> 01:01:26,784
>> Enough!

980
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:37,661
>> Sorry, I was pushy,
but your people need a leader.

981
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,696
And I think it's
your father's time.

982
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,665
>> You want all the answers?

983
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,869
The station my father knows,
the inside and out.

984
01:01:44,902 --> 01:01:46,603
When they asked him
to come here,

985
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:50,007
it was to train guards to
protect military secrets

986
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,876
not guards
for instruments of death.

987
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:54,745
>> They lied to your father,
it wasn't his fault.

988
01:01:55,913 --> 01:01:58,916
(heavy footsteps)

989
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,724
(heavy footsteps)
(machinery humming)

990
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,297
>> What the hell are you doing
out of the control room?

991
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:15,299
>> I had to take a dump
for crying out loud.

992
01:02:15,332 --> 01:02:17,134
>> Well, you're the genius.

993
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:20,404
Figure out some way to do that
while you watch that monitor.

994
01:02:20,437 --> 01:02:22,406
I'm not done with you yet.

995
01:02:22,439 --> 01:02:25,876
If this thing screws up
you'll go down with me.

996
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,044
Do you have
a problem with that?

997
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,678
>> Yeah, I do.

998
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:32,482
I created the perfect protector
not the perfect killer.

999
01:02:32,516 --> 01:02:36,053
>> It's the same thing,
other side of the coin, kid.

1000
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,755
Anyway, I didn't
see you complaining

1001
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:43,193
when you had Zoey Kinsella's
body to fondle in this project.

1002
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:49,766
>> I suppose you figure no one
would notice one more boy,

1003
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:52,636
that wasn't perfect.

1004
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:56,473
You orchestrated it all
from the control room.

1005
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,075
And that
bad team rushed in

1006
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:00,010
and all of a sudden
she was on my table.

1007
01:03:00,044 --> 01:03:02,012
And you knew.

1008
01:03:02,046 --> 01:03:03,513
You knew no one
would ever realize

1009
01:03:03,547 --> 01:03:05,382
what had really killed her?

1010
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:07,985
>> And what's that?

1011
01:03:09,053 --> 01:03:12,890
A bullet from a handgun, hmm.

1012
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:17,227
A handgun, like this.

1013
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:20,164
Wrong kid.

1014
01:03:20,197 --> 01:03:22,867
Guns don't kill people,

1015
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,902
people kill people.

1016
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:29,974
(gun firing)

1017
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:38,815
(dramatic music)

1018
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:42,019
Well, well, well.

1019
01:03:42,052 --> 01:03:45,489
You were closer to the truth
than you thought lover boy.

1020
01:03:46,056 --> 01:03:49,059
>> Lifers, guard
Terminal entrance here.

1021
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:53,063
And we going to hide over here.

1022
01:03:54,231 --> 01:03:57,334
>> First, we need more fighters.

1023
01:03:57,367 --> 01:03:59,369
The Lifers are very tough.

1024
01:03:59,403 --> 01:04:01,605
>> Sumai, you're okay.

1025
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,842
(dramatic music)

1026
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:10,047
Listen, you people need to
get with the program.

1027
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:11,648
Sumai said it all.

1028
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,051
The time to act is now.

1029
01:04:14,084 --> 01:04:16,753
>> We trust Sumai,
but Niki's a killer.

1030
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,755
>> The old guy
struts his stuff

1031
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:21,691
and you're all ready to
drop to your knees.

1032
01:04:21,725 --> 01:04:23,727
Well go ahead
and let this little fossil

1033
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,329
get you all killed.

1034
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:28,365
If you're looking for a leader,
I'm right here.

1035
01:04:29,066 --> 01:04:30,834
This guy's a joke.

1036
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,602
(crowd murmuring)

1037
01:04:32,636 --> 01:04:34,271
>> My time to lead.

1038
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:41,878
(dramatic music)

1039
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:46,883
(fighting sequence)

1040
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:56,893
(dramatic music)

1041
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,731
>> Who will join us
to fight Niki Picasso?

1042
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,904
(dramatic music)

1043
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,314
>> I vouch for these two.

1044
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:22,519
(training sequence)

1045
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:41,938
(training sequence)

1046
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:01,958
(training sequence)

1047
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:08,932
>> We've just
gotten word from Niki.

1048
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:12,969
>> That's good Bigelow,
our plans are unfolding nicely.

1049
01:06:17,374 --> 01:06:19,709
So, we have a lot to do.

1050
01:06:19,743 --> 01:06:23,180
>> An extended coffee break,
I presume.

1051
01:06:23,713 --> 01:06:27,551
There's a little something
I want to discuss with you.

1052
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:32,389
It concerns my
TC2000X.

1053
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:35,792
>> Well, sir your

1054
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,362
TC2000X, is just fine.

1055
01:06:38,395 --> 01:06:39,596
>> Really?

1056
01:06:40,064 --> 01:06:42,332
The TC2000X was conceived

1057
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:44,401
to protect the people
in my quadrant,

1058
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:46,436
that was her sole purpose.

1059
01:06:48,905 --> 01:06:51,741
I want you and your boys
to catch the next bus

1060
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,677
to surface world

1061
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,713
and I want my investment
back here, now.

1062
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,249
(laughing)

1063
01:06:59,283 --> 01:07:00,517
>> Bigelow.

1064
01:07:01,918 --> 01:07:04,921
>> You wouldn't not here,
not now in front of everybody.

1065
01:07:06,223 --> 01:07:07,424
(groaning loudly)

1066
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:15,932
>> Bigelow,

1067
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,735
I think you're going to
like living on surface world.

1068
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:29,045
(dramatic music)

1069
01:07:38,455 --> 01:07:42,459
(thunder rumbling)

1070
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,061
(dog barking)

1071
01:07:51,268 --> 01:07:52,736
>> Guys are going to
protect Terminal Station

1072
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:54,037
with their lives.

1073
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,072
We'll just see about that.

1074
01:07:58,475 --> 01:08:01,245
>> Clancy, Blade
take out the guards.

1075
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:03,113
Zircon, follow behind.

1076
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,883
(dramatic music)

1077
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,518
>> Yaah!
>> Ooh!

1078
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:13,056
(dramatic music)

1079
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:14,258
>> Death to the Lifers!

1080
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:17,060
(gun firing)

1081
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:21,097
(people screaming and yelling)
(gun firing)

1082
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:30,106
(people screaming and yelling)
(gun firing)

1083
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:38,682
(people screaming and yelling)
(gun firing)

1084
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:39,949
Done.

1085
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,685
>> Shit!

1086
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:43,153
>> Yaah! Yaah!

1087
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:53,129
(fighting sequence)
(dramatic music)

1088
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:02,506
(fighting sequence)
(dramatic music)

1089
01:09:02,539 --> 01:09:04,174
>> Death to the Lifers!

1090
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:08,144
(fighting sequence)

1091
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:10,747
>> Looks like Niki Picasso
beat us to it.

1092
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:19,155
(fighting sequence)
(dramatic music)

1093
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:27,163
Let's let them
kill off the Lifers.

1094
01:09:27,197 --> 01:09:29,199
And then we make our move.

1095
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:38,174
(fighting sequence)
(dramatic music)

1096
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:48,184
(fighting sequence)
(dramatic music)

1097
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:57,761
>> Well you got me to
the Terminal Station.

1098
01:09:57,794 --> 01:10:00,797
Now, let's just wait
for the Controller.

1099
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:03,367
>> Let's party.

1100
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:14,210
(dramatic music)

1101
01:10:18,415 --> 01:10:19,616
(can clinking)

1102
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:23,953
Okay!
I got you your Citadel.

1103
01:10:23,987 --> 01:10:26,390
>> You've done
a soldier's job Niki.

1104
01:10:26,423 --> 01:10:28,057
And you'll get
everything I promised.

1105
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:31,395
Guns, ammunition
and real food.

1106
01:10:31,428 --> 01:10:32,396
(people cheering)

1107
01:10:32,429 --> 01:10:33,763
>> And then what?

1108
01:10:33,797 --> 01:10:37,133
>> See then you will live
like Kings and Queens

1109
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:38,935
here on the surface world.

1110
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:41,237
You stay here,
we'll be right back.

1111
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:42,772
>> Heh, No.

1112
01:10:42,806 --> 01:10:46,242
I'm going up too. I'm not
letting you out of my sight.

1113
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:52,616
The key to her father's house.

1114
01:10:52,649 --> 01:10:54,851
And the key to my future.

1115
01:10:56,353 --> 01:10:57,954
Now it's time
for daddy's little girl

1116
01:10:57,987 --> 01:11:00,624
to get down on
her knees isn't it?

1117
01:11:00,657 --> 01:11:02,726
Because daddy's little girl
was much smaller

1118
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,761
when he made this lock.
Would you?

1119
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:13,236
(beeping)

1120
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,472
>> Positive identification.

1121
01:11:20,043 --> 01:11:22,045
>> It is time.

1122
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:29,686
(machines whirring loudly)

1123
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:36,292
(door opening)
(people cheering)

1124
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:39,463
Let's go!

1125
01:11:39,496 --> 01:11:40,697
>> Okay!

1126
01:11:42,332 --> 01:11:43,867
>> Attention Christmas shoppers.

1127
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,902
The store is now closing.

1128
01:11:46,503 --> 01:11:47,704
>> Let's go!

1129
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:54,310
(dramatic music)

1130
01:11:57,847 --> 01:12:00,149
>> You know, your father
was a brilliant man Zoey.

1131
01:12:00,183 --> 01:12:02,786
Unfortunately,
he was also a fool.

1132
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,988
He thought he could
save the surface world.

1133
01:12:05,021 --> 01:12:08,425
He died before the full power of
Terminal Station was realized.

1134
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:14,330
(machines whirring)
(footsteps running)

1135
01:12:18,735 --> 01:12:19,936
>> Come on, let's go.

1136
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:26,876
(heavy footsteps)

1137
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:30,547
>> The Kill Zone is only
accessible from the top floor.

1138
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,081
So we'll cut through
the cook house here

1139
01:12:32,115 --> 01:12:33,517
under the stairs.

1140
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:35,852
(men yelling)

1141
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:37,687
>> Be careful.

1142
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:39,723
(men yelling)

1143
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:44,728
(Sumai yelling)
(dramatic music)

1144
01:12:44,761 --> 01:12:45,929
>> Who the hell are they?

1145
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:47,997
>> It's Jason Storm
and Master Sumai.

1146
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:49,165
>> And what are they doing here?

1147
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,035
>> Don't look at me.
Blade go help them, come on.

1148
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:53,570
Move!

1149
01:12:56,372 --> 01:13:00,376

(fighting sequence)
(dramatic music)

1154
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,479
>> Bitch!

1155
01:14:10,847 --> 01:14:12,048
Yaah!

1156
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:19,455
(fighting sequence)

1157
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:25,662

Yaah!

1159
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:29,699
>> Ooh! Aah!

1160
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:35,705

>> Stop!

1166
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:45,609
Where's the Controller?

1167

>> This way.

1172
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:18,968
>> Any problems?

1173
01:17:19,002 --> 01:17:20,837
>> No problems.

1174
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:26,676
>> Harold.

1175
01:17:33,549 --> 01:17:36,185
Kill Zone's
right through that door.

1176
01:17:36,219 --> 01:17:37,854
(Controller snickering)

1177
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:43,392
Scott, guard the rear.

1178
01:17:46,062 --> 01:17:49,498
(footsteps running)

1179
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,172
We won't be a minute.

1180
01:17:56,205 --> 01:17:58,407
>> I may start liking
surface world.

1181
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:25,434
(jacket thudding on ground)

1182
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:28,271

(door opening)

1189
01:19:15,284 --> 01:19:17,286
>> Welcome to the Kill Zone.

1190
01:19:39,876 --> 01:19:41,110
>> Sumai!

1191
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:44,280
Welcome home.

(fighting sequence)
(dramatic music)

1196
01:20:11,407 --> 01:20:13,642
>> So why do you call this
the Kill Zone?

1197
01:20:13,676 --> 01:20:16,479
>> This was originally built to
replenish the atmosphere.

1198
01:20:16,512 --> 01:20:18,781
But a few modifications
have been made since then.

1199
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,816
(Controller laughing)

1200
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:29,225
>> I got us here.

1201
01:20:29,258 --> 01:20:33,329
>> Yes TC, you're finished.
Ironic isn't it.

1202
01:20:33,362 --> 01:20:35,131
Your program
and your father's program

1203
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,000
both wind down in the same room.

1204

(Controller laughing)

1205
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,670
Come Niki, let me show you
what real power feels like.

(dramatic music)

1207

01:21:34,323 --> 01:21:36,092
>> This launcher contains
the chemicals,

1212
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:38,361
individually they're inert
but you mix them together

1213
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:39,862
it's as deadly as cyanide.

1214
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,698
48 hours later
the effect dies out.

1215
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:44,934
>> And you take over
surface world.

1216
01:21:44,968 --> 01:21:46,702
>> We take over
surface world Niki,

1217
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,871
but let's talk about that later.

Zoey, what's wrong with you?

1232
01:22:52,168 --> 01:22:54,670
Cameron's program
really fucked you up.

1233

I got you.

01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:57,092
(man screaming
being electrocuted)

1263
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:01,264
>> Beep, beep,
shut the damn machine down.

1264
01:25:01,297 --> 01:25:04,133
(missile launching)

1265
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,273
(explosion)

1266
01:25:10,306 --> 01:25:12,074
>> Can't hear you Niki.

1267
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:14,677
They love a blitz.

1268
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:18,647
Insufficient time now exist to
travel to the safety zones.

1269
01:25:18,681 --> 01:25:21,417
If you have not reported to
your designated area

1270
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:24,353
you must use
emergency precautions now.

1271
01:25:24,387 --> 01:25:26,389
High pressure chambers will...

1272
01:25:27,456 --> 01:25:30,259
3, 5 and 7.

1273
01:25:30,293 --> 01:25:33,462
Emergency supplies
will be within.

1274
01:25:33,496 --> 01:25:34,697
Repeat.

1275
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:38,267
Insufficient time now exists
for travel to safety zones.

1276
01:25:38,301 --> 01:25:41,003
If you have not reported to
your designated area

1277
01:25:41,036 --> 01:25:43,472
you must use
emergency precautions now.

1278
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:52,147
(fighting sequence)
(dramatic music)

1279
01:25:53,349 --> 01:25:54,750
>> Aah!

1280
01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:01,190
Warning! Gaseous chemical will
be launched at 2 minute mark.

1281
01:26:01,224 --> 01:26:05,027
Layer 4 of the atmospheric gases
will be discharged.

1282
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:11,133
Stage 4 of the surface world
cleansing will be complete.

1283
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:13,902
(dramatic music)

1284
01:26:13,936 --> 01:26:15,371
>> Open the door.

1285
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:28,183
(fighting sequence)
(dramatic music)

1286
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:32,355
>> Aah!

1287
01:26:32,588 --> 01:26:35,758
(alarm beeping)

1288
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:37,360
>> Live long Sumai!

1289
01:26:37,393 --> 01:26:39,395
You know the world's
falling apart.

1290
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:41,564
>> Open the door.

1291
01:26:41,597 --> 01:26:43,232
>> Over my dead body.

1292
01:26:43,266 --> 01:26:44,900
(alarm beeping)

1293
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:47,570
You were once
a great warrior Sumai.

1294
01:26:49,572 --> 01:26:52,775
But now,
you are nothing.

1295
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:56,044
(Sumai yelling)

1296
01:26:59,615 --> 01:27:02,251
>> Aah!

1297
01:27:06,955 --> 01:27:08,591
>> Nice punch.

1298
01:27:08,957 --> 01:27:10,158
>> Come on.

1299
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:15,698
>> Launched at 1 minute mark.
>> Damn!

1300
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:18,033
>> All nucleic layers
will be replaced

1301
01:27:18,066 --> 01:27:21,970
and ready for chemical catalyst
1, 2 and 3.

1302
01:27:22,004 --> 01:27:24,239
Prepare for chemical fallout.

1303
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:29,612
(dramatic music)

1304
01:27:29,645 --> 01:27:31,614
>> Aah! Goddamn!

1305
01:27:31,647 --> 01:27:33,749
>> I trusted you and you left me
down there to die.

1306
01:27:33,782 --> 01:27:35,984
>> We'll both die
if we don't get out of here.

1307
01:27:36,018 --> 01:27:38,120
>> You're going to die first.
>> No Niki,

1308
01:27:38,153 --> 01:27:40,789
I got the antidote
to the chemical.

1309
01:27:42,325 --> 01:27:43,326
No!
>> Thank you.

1310
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:45,794
>> Niki! Aah! Please!

1311
01:27:47,663 --> 01:27:50,098
>> Aah!

1312
01:27:55,338 --> 01:27:58,173
(missile launching)

1313
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:02,277
(explosion)

1314
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:05,781
>> You're brilliant Sumai.

1315
01:28:05,814 --> 01:28:07,816
Deflect the laser
over to the right.

1316
01:28:13,055 --> 01:28:14,890
I'll take care of TC.

1317
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,963
>> All death rays will be
launched in 2 minus 5 seconds.

1318
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:26,134
(missile launching)

1319
01:28:26,502 --> 01:28:28,904
>> Zoey whatever happened
to partners forever?

1320
01:28:30,506 --> 01:28:33,509
(computer static)

1321
01:28:38,514 --> 01:28:40,148
>> Jason!

1322
01:28:41,517 --> 01:28:42,685
>> Zoey!

1323
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:43,919
>> Jason!

1324
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,721
Jason.

1325
01:28:51,059 --> 01:28:54,497
>> Atmosphere glares are
in place...catalyst #2.

1326
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:57,232
>> What the hell's going on?

1327
01:28:57,265 --> 01:29:00,403
>> Cameron put a virus in your
program to shut you down.

1328
01:29:00,436 --> 01:29:01,670
>> What?

1329
01:29:02,204 --> 01:29:03,506
>> Never mind!

1330
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:05,340
We're in the Terminal Station
that your father built.

1331
01:29:05,374 --> 01:29:07,376
How do we stop this thing?

1332
01:29:07,410 --> 01:29:09,077
>> My father would have left
some sort of password

1333
01:29:09,111 --> 01:29:10,513
or something.

1334
01:29:10,546 --> 01:29:13,382
>> It's Zoey,
you're the key.

1335
01:29:13,416 --> 01:29:14,717
>> Yeah!

1336
01:29:14,750 --> 01:29:16,585
Of course, my necklace.

1337
01:29:17,052 --> 01:29:18,153
(computer beeping)

1338
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:20,389
(missile launching)

1339
01:29:23,058 --> 01:29:24,893
>> I'll input Kinsella.

1340
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:28,531
>> Execution of chemical...

1341
01:29:28,564 --> 01:29:29,965
>> Try Underworld.

1342
01:29:30,433 --> 01:29:34,036
>> Third and final catalyst
will be launched at Mark Zero .

1343
01:29:34,069 --> 01:29:37,172
Execution of all chemical
reactions will be complete.

1344
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:39,808
And surface world
cleansing achieved.

1345
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:45,047
Surface world cleansing will
commence at T minus 10 seconds.

1346
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:50,318
10, 9, 8, 7,

1347
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:55,691
6, 5, 4,

1348
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:58,561
3, 2.

1349
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:02,831
>> Life!

1350
01:30:04,933 --> 01:30:07,135
Zoey is Greek for Life.

1351
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:11,774
You knew my father didn't you?

1352
01:30:11,807 --> 01:30:13,642
>> He told me.

1353
01:30:16,679 --> 01:30:18,647
>> Let's get the hell
out of here.

1354
01:30:18,681 --> 01:30:20,916
>> Niki come here.

1355
01:30:20,949 --> 01:30:22,117
Don't leave me up here.

1356
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,952
Celebrate as the first.

1357
01:30:23,986 --> 01:30:26,822
Zoey save me,
save me, save me.

1358
01:30:33,529 --> 01:30:35,964
I've got the treatment.

1359
01:30:40,703 --> 01:30:42,971
>> Beautiful isn't it?

1360
01:30:43,005 --> 01:30:46,108
Mother Nature
really is healing herself.

1361
01:30:46,141 --> 01:30:49,011
>> This place, not so bad.

1362
01:30:49,044 --> 01:30:51,480
>> And the Controller
knew it all along.

1363
01:30:52,715 --> 01:30:54,550
>> Welcome home, partner.

1364
01:31:02,157 --> 01:31:04,493
Mother Nature
was healing herself.

1365
01:31:04,527 --> 01:31:06,461
And the Controller knew it.

1366
01:31:06,495 --> 01:31:07,863
It was people like him

1367
01:31:07,896 --> 01:31:11,133
that got us into this mess
in the first place.

1368
01:31:11,166 --> 01:31:13,268
But if the Earth
could start anew

1369
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:15,303
perhaps so could we.

1370
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:23,311
(dramatic music)
(drums beating)
