00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:55,322
You know, Steph, it's not
like I haven't tried, okay?

3
00:00:57,425 --> 00:01:00,793
I never know how you're
gonna react to anything.

4
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:02,495
I... I... Every single day
is a different emotion,

5
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:04,431
I come home to a
different situation,

6
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:08,368
something I have to deal with.
Something that is oppressive.

7
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,504
That's just mentally draining.

8
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:14,808
Over the past eight months,
I began to realize that,

9
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,913
dating you
has been harder on me

10
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:22,782
mentally, spiritually,

11
00:01:22,784 --> 00:01:27,854
and every other kind of way that
I could possibly have imagined.

12
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:31,324
I started smoking.

13
00:01:31,326 --> 00:01:35,262
You can't tell me you had
nothing to do with that.

14
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:38,598
I never cheated on you.

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,235
I know you didn't.
I know.

16
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:44,238
But there's more to it
than that.

17
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,307
You're an awful person.

18
00:01:47,309 --> 00:01:51,480
Honestly, I mean, I... Your
friends must fucking lie to you

19
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:53,682
because no one is telling
you the truth.

20
00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:57,718
I'm the one who has to deal
with it every single day. Me.

21
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,289
Your... your mood swings,
your attitudes,

22
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:02,356
you're being manipulative,
you're selfish.

23
00:02:02,358 --> 00:02:03,525
You treat all your
friends like shit.

24
00:02:03,527 --> 00:02:04,692
That's not true.

25
00:02:04,694 --> 00:02:06,495
You know how you
are with people.

26
00:02:06,497 --> 00:02:09,898
You know that, and...

27
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,570
if I don't get out now,
you're gonna ruin me,

28
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:15,537
like you ruined all of them.

29
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:18,740
You said that we were the same.

30
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:22,345
How could you be
so mean to me?

31
00:02:22,347 --> 00:02:28,284
Stephanie, do you ever think the reason
we don't work is because we are the same?

32
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:29,918
Same person.

33
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,989
We're both
extremely fucked up.

34
00:02:32,991 --> 00:02:35,960
I'm just gonna nip it in the bud
and tell you how I feel right now,

35
00:02:35,962 --> 00:02:38,429
it's what I'm doing.

36
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:42,335
And honestly, I think you should, if
anything, you should respect me for that.

37
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:50,807
Shit.

38
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:54,414
Can I get my stuff?
I got somewhere I gotta be.

39
00:02:56,815 --> 00:03:00,451
Yeah.

40
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:01,853
I'll get your stuff.

41
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:04,923
Thanks.

42
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:16,938
Hey, would you...
would you relax?

43
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:20,408
Yes, I know.
I'm doing it now.

44
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:26,646
Yeah, and in ten minutes
this crazy bitch will be

45
00:03:26,648 --> 00:03:29,448
in the fucking rear-view
mirror, just relax.

46
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:33,919
Yeah, I know.

47
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:37,259
I never called you a piece
on the side, so shut up.

48
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:43,232
Yeah.

49
00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:30,780
Yeah, I love you.

50
00:04:56,673 --> 00:04:58,673
What the fuck?

51
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:03,380
Are you fucking crazy?

52
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:43,454
We were perfect together,
Chad.

53
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:46,992
We could have been
so much more.

54
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,594
Hey! What's up?

55
00:06:54,596 --> 00:06:58,435
I... I really need you.

56
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:04,508
Okay.

57
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,787
Yeah?

58
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:22,626
I need you to drop whatever
you're doing and get over here.

59
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:26,194
What happened?

60
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:30,132
Something bad, okay?
I just need you.

61
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:32,701
I'll be there as soon as I can.

62
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,706
Good.

63
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,546
Hey, I like what you
did with your hair.

64
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,283
It's kind of different
and awesome, you know?

65
00:07:47,285 --> 00:07:49,487
Or not.

66
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:30,597
Okay, Stephanie,
what do you want us to do?

67
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:44,003
Where should we go?

68
00:09:44,005 --> 00:09:47,009
As far away as possible.

69
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:04,921
Are we really gonna do this?

70
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:06,927
Yeah.

71
00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:13,032
Okay.

72
00:11:40,126 --> 00:11:42,194
Are you sure
we're out far enough?

73
00:11:42,196 --> 00:11:45,266
I still see lights out there.

74
00:11:48,804 --> 00:11:52,207
It's the desert,
we're miles away.

75
00:13:43,221 --> 00:13:46,123
Hey.

76
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,026
It's okay.

77
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,627
It's okay.

78
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:05,980
I told you to fucking
cut the lights.

79
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,616
I left them on so you could... so you
could see what you're doing, okay?

80
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:14,253
I left them on so you could see what you're doing.

81
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:17,423
- Son of a bitch.
- What the heck?

82
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:20,527
Come on,
everything's gonna be fine.

83
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:25,532
- Come on, let's...
- Don't touch me right now.

84
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:29,471
Really?

85
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:37,478
Carrie, come take care
of your friend.

86
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:54,195
Sorry.

87
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:13,984
Fuck!
What the fuck?

88
00:15:16,318 --> 00:15:18,218
Fuck it.

89
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,023
What?

90
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,056
- What?
- Don't want to say.

91
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:24,426
Good for you.

92
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:29,096
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

93
00:15:29,098 --> 00:15:32,166
I told you to fucking cut
the lights.

94
00:15:32,168 --> 00:15:34,636
Son of a bitch!

95
00:15:34,638 --> 00:15:38,739
Didn't think the battery was gonna die from
leaving the light on for, like, two seconds.

96
00:15:38,741 --> 00:15:42,310
So, uh, what I'm gonna do is, I'm
just gonna hike up to the road,

97
00:15:42,312 --> 00:15:45,346
and I'll hitchhike so...

98
00:15:45,348 --> 00:15:46,681
we can get another car
over here, okay?

99
00:15:46,683 --> 00:15:48,651
No. That's the worst idea.

100
00:15:48,653 --> 00:15:50,552
It's not a bad idea. I mean,
we're just gonna be stuck...

101
00:15:50,554 --> 00:15:53,156
Dave's the idea guy.

102
00:15:53,158 --> 00:15:56,392
Yeah, the idea guy that got our car dead
and now we're in the middle of nowhere.

103
00:15:56,394 --> 00:15:58,461
It's not a bad idea, okay?

104
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,831
They're not going to allow four
people to hitchhike with them, so...

105
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,633
- We shouldn't leave the car...
- No, we... Yeah,

106
00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:06,836
- we're gonna stay together.
- No, Steph. Why don't...

107
00:16:06,838 --> 00:16:08,738
No, no one's staying together,
we can stay here with the car

108
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,076
and some of us can go find
somebody else to jump the car.

109
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:13,677
No, we're gonna
all stay together...

110
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,245
And stay here? Just hang out,
wait for the body to rot?

111
00:16:16,247 --> 00:16:18,314
No, we're gonna
go together and get a car

112
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:20,616
and then come back here
and get rid of this mess.

113
00:16:20,618 --> 00:16:22,351
- And just leave the car here?
- Okay?

114
00:16:22,353 --> 00:16:26,658
Together. We are not leaving
each others' sights.

115
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,659
- We can't leave the car
- Great.

116
00:16:29,661 --> 00:16:31,595
We'll come back and jump
the car and we'll go, okay?

117
00:16:31,597 --> 00:16:33,600
Jeb, let's just go.

118
00:16:36,636 --> 00:16:40,704
Okay.
Great. Let's go.

119
00:16:40,706 --> 00:16:43,710
Do you need a light?

120
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,279
Thank you very much.

121
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:51,515
Just go.

122
00:16:51,517 --> 00:16:53,852
- It's a good idea, Jeb.
- Here we go.

123
00:16:53,854 --> 00:16:56,588
The sooner we get this done, the
sooner we can stop complaining

124
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,593
and go back to our normal lives.

125
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:02,363
Let's go.

126
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,214
I know this is messed up,
but this isn't... this isn't her,

127
00:17:22,216 --> 00:17:23,582
this is just an off day.

128
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,584
- An off day?
- Yeah.

129
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,187
An off day? Carrie,
she just buried a body.

130
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:30,189
I mean, it's not like that
happens all the time.

131
00:17:30,191 --> 00:17:32,792
Jeb, she is my friend.
She's my best friend.

132
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:35,262
I mean, we have to support her.

133
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:38,798
I get that you two are close,
I can accept that.

134
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:44,471
But look, I don't know her shit,
and neither do you. Okay?

135
00:17:44,473 --> 00:17:48,775
I mean, I don't know. All I know is
that she's usually not like this

136
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:50,710
and she's the only person who's
ever really been there for me.

137
00:17:50,712 --> 00:17:52,245
- She...
- Oh, okay.

138
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:54,782
Okay, before I met you,
she was the only person.

139
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:58,285
The only person
who cared about me.

140
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:01,321
Please can we just trust her?

141
00:18:01,323 --> 00:18:03,623
Please?
Please?

142
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,626
Fine. All right.

143
00:18:05,628 --> 00:18:08,462
If you want to stay here,
that's what we're doing, okay?

144
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:12,567
But just know,
that I am here for you.

145
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:14,870
Not her.
All right?

146
00:18:14,872 --> 00:18:18,707
And the minute that bitch tries
to throw you under the bus,

147
00:18:18,709 --> 00:18:20,976
I'm gonna park it on top
of her. You got it?

148
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:23,312
Got it.

149
00:18:23,314 --> 00:18:24,912
Good.

150
00:18:24,914 --> 00:18:25,947
I love you.

151
00:18:25,949 --> 00:18:28,152
I love you, too.

152
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:33,257
Come on.

153
00:18:34,925 --> 00:18:36,226
What happened?

154
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:37,427
What do you mean?

155
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:40,496
You know,
between you and...

156
00:18:40,498 --> 00:18:42,798
Mister Perfect.

157
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,936
Um, none of your business...
that's what happened.

158
00:18:46,938 --> 00:18:51,774
Well, I think that because maybe the fact
that I'm helping you quite a bit here,

159
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:54,244
that I deserve to get some
kind of information.

160
00:18:54,246 --> 00:18:57,513
Just the slightest
information, at all.

161
00:18:57,515 --> 00:18:59,382
I just don't want
to talk about it.

162
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:01,517
Come on, you know I'm not
gonna tell anyone.

163
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:03,286
I mean, I'm here helping
you out.

164
00:19:03,288 --> 00:19:04,988
We're on the same team.

165
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,558
You don't need to know anything.
If you were in my position,

166
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,361
you'd do the same thing.

167
00:19:10,363 --> 00:19:14,297
So you can
just leave it alone.

168
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:16,734
Okay, fine, whatever. Just...

169
00:19:16,736 --> 00:19:19,436
No, it's not whatever,
you just drop it.

170
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:21,505
Stephanie treats Dave
like a puppy.

171
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:24,843
Yeah, well, he's been warned
and he still does it anyway.

172
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:28,779
You gotta be nicer to me. I'm not...
I'm not like this other guy.

173
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:30,417
It's not fair.

174
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:42,027
What are we gonna do?

175
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:44,028
I don't know.

176
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,864
I mean, she's not even
acknowledging it.

177
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:48,334
She's not saying anything.

178
00:19:48,336 --> 00:19:50,603
Hey, if you have something to say,
why don't you say it to my face?

179
00:19:50,605 --> 00:19:52,505
Take it easy, all right?

180
00:19:52,507 --> 00:19:55,540
I think that we should make
some kind of plan.

181
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:59,377
Okay, when I figure it out,
I'll let you know.

182
00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:02,815
Okay, well, we're waiting,
so any minute now would be nice.

183
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:06,618
Steph, we can figure out some kind of plan
together before we go back and get a car.

184
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,954
I'm figuring it out, so until
then, shut the hell up!

185
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:12,392
- Stephanie, we need an alibi, okay?
- Great.

186
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:13,894
Hear her out. Come on.

187
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:15,761
Okay, do you have any ideas?

188
00:20:15,763 --> 00:20:19,833
'Cause right now,
you're just complaining.

189
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:22,568
Yeah. Yeah, I think I do.

190
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,773
You think you do, or you do?

191
00:20:26,508 --> 00:20:30,510
Okay, what if we never left
your house, right?

192
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:33,847
What if, um,
we were still there?

193
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:36,384
Having a party or something,
you know, drinking.

194
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:40,521
We could take pictures to commemorate
whatever we're celebrating.

195
00:20:40,523 --> 00:20:43,590
We can pretend that we were,
I mean, all together.

196
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:44,959
That's a good idea.

197
00:20:44,961 --> 00:20:46,894
- At your house.
- That's a great idea.

198
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:49,062
- So...
- Do you still have those beers?

199
00:20:49,064 --> 00:20:50,998
Yeah, it's... gonna...

200
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,367
Brilliant, okay, that's
actually a really good idea.

201
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:54,635
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, it's great.

202
00:20:54,637 --> 00:20:55,903
- One for you.
- It's really good.

203
00:20:55,905 --> 00:20:57,137
Who's got a camera?

204
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:58,673
- I do... I have my phone,
- Yeah great.

205
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,008
You want it now? Okay.

206
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,643
- Yeah.
- Turn off your lights.

207
00:21:01,645 --> 00:21:02,977
- Okay.
- Hide the flashlights.

208
00:21:02,979 --> 00:21:06,915
No lights, and, um,
just get our faces.

209
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:07,916
Yeah, okay.

210
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:09,417
- Um.
- Um.

211
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:11,753
No, like, Joshua tree's
in the background.

212
00:21:11,755 --> 00:21:14,490
Okay, everybody in? You guys,
come in closer, Dave.

213
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:18,830
Okay, one, two, ah!

214
00:21:19,897 --> 00:21:21,929
- Yeah? Again?
- One more.

215
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:23,532
- You want to do a silly face?
- Yeah.

216
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:24,801
Okay, one, two,
we're having a party.

217
00:21:26,571 --> 00:21:28,670
We're having a party? Yeah,
this is a great party.

218
00:21:28,672 --> 00:21:30,740
- That's my party face.
- Brilliant.

219
00:21:30,742 --> 00:21:32,175
- All right, perfect.
- It was actually a really good idea.

220
00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:33,609
- Let's go.
- It was brilliant.

221
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:35,145
- You think so?
- It was really good.

222
00:21:35,147 --> 00:21:38,481
- Yeah, okay.
- You remember, like, three years ago?

223
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:41,050
When I wasn't in your life? I doubt you
would have had an idea as great as that.

224
00:21:41,052 --> 00:21:42,755
Hmm, probably not.

225
00:21:53,498 --> 00:21:56,499
Steph, can we... can we
just take a break? I just...

226
00:21:56,501 --> 00:21:58,701
We've been walking forever,
I'm just exhausted.

227
00:21:58,703 --> 00:22:01,171
Wait, you're just gonna sit here
in the middle of the desert?

228
00:22:01,173 --> 00:22:06,209
Yeah, it's... We're tired.
Come on, it's... Oh my God,

229
00:22:06,211 --> 00:22:09,914
I'm so tired and cold and we
don't have any water. Just...

230
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,149
- Fine.
- just five minutes.

231
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:14,218
Fine.

232
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,487
Oh, should we get the boys?

233
00:22:16,489 --> 00:22:22,159
No, they will be fine.

234
00:22:25,565 --> 00:22:27,098
All right,
so I just have to ask,

235
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,868
how did you wind up
chasing after that?

236
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,603
Whatever you think of her, she's
actually pretty awesome, okay?

237
00:22:32,605 --> 00:22:35,041
Really, 'cause awesome people
don't murder their boyfriends.

238
00:22:35,043 --> 00:22:37,677
All right? She could have keyed
his car or burned his clothes,

239
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,712
murder kinda takes it to
a different level.

240
00:22:40,714 --> 00:22:42,113
She's spontaneous.

241
00:22:42,115 --> 00:22:44,749
Why are you always
standing up for her?

242
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:49,087
Okay, I understand this is an awful
situation but she's bringing us together

243
00:22:49,089 --> 00:22:52,592
and she's keeping us safe. And I
know you only see her in, like, a...

244
00:22:52,594 --> 00:22:55,728
a bad light,
but she's more than that.

245
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,632
You sound like a cult follower.

246
00:22:58,634 --> 00:23:02,268
Jeb, I love that girl.

247
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,604
- I love her.
- Oh.

248
00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:07,607
I know she's crazy but she
goes after what she wants.

249
00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:10,844
- And I'm a part of that.
- Yes! Dave, you are.

250
00:23:10,846 --> 00:23:12,214
You're being used.

251
00:23:14,016 --> 00:23:16,749
All girls are manipulative, Jeb.

252
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:19,252
And sometimes it's far worse
than this.

253
00:23:19,254 --> 00:23:21,523
You don't want more?

254
00:23:22,858 --> 00:23:25,293
Of course I want more,
but that's...

255
00:23:25,295 --> 00:23:28,695
You know, I'm just trying to
hold on to what I have.

256
00:23:28,697 --> 00:23:31,833
So you just showed
up one day and said,

257
00:23:31,835 --> 00:23:33,166
"Oh, hey,
I'll worship you.

258
00:23:33,168 --> 00:23:34,935
Pick me."

259
00:23:34,937 --> 00:23:37,639
Yep, you're right, Jeb.
You got it right on the nose.

260
00:23:37,641 --> 00:23:40,945
You know something? I've know Carrie
a lot longer than I've known Steph.

261
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,077
My Carrie?

262
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:45,915
Yeah, we were really close.

263
00:23:47,117 --> 00:23:49,317
But then she introduced
me to Steph,

264
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:52,054
and then I fell for her.
And she's, yeah...

265
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,994
Oh, well that's a love story
of epic proportions.

266
00:23:59,996 --> 00:24:02,199
I didn't know that.

267
00:24:04,001 --> 00:24:07,236
But you know, then the whole
Stephanie thing happened.

268
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,837
No, I don't know.

269
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:13,712
She even told me to not, uh, pursue Stephanie,
saying I was going to ruin everything.

270
00:24:15,012 --> 00:24:17,280
Yeah, but you did...
you did it anyway.

271
00:24:17,282 --> 00:24:19,348
- Jeb, I know you think I'm this loser.
- Mm-hmm.

272
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,283
But the real question is,

273
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:23,953
why was Carrie so upset that I
was pursuing Steph and not her?

274
00:24:23,955 --> 00:24:25,622
I don't know,

275
00:24:25,624 --> 00:24:28,692
maybe it's because she knew
Steph was a trainwreck.

276
00:24:28,694 --> 00:24:30,026
She was trying to protect
you from that.

277
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:32,194
Because that's what
good friends do.

278
00:24:32,196 --> 00:24:35,733
Oh, thanks, you know, friends don't
let friends pursue true happiness.

279
00:24:35,735 --> 00:24:39,669
No, you see, I was thinking, friends don't
let friends pursue bad relationships

280
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:41,371
that ultimately
lead to murder.

281
00:24:41,373 --> 00:24:42,740
Or maybe you
missed that class.

282
00:24:42,742 --> 00:24:44,875
Why are you here, Jeb?

283
00:24:44,877 --> 00:24:50,013
I'm not gonna let Carrie run around in
the desert by herself with Stephanie.

284
00:24:50,015 --> 00:24:53,553
You know, uh, the two of 'em
are more alike than you think.

285
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,687
Carrie is nothing
like that sociopath.

286
00:24:57,689 --> 00:24:59,925
Oh, yes, she is.

287
00:24:59,927 --> 00:25:03,095
They are really close friends
and they rub off on each other.

288
00:25:03,097 --> 00:25:06,063
I would be careful.

289
00:25:06,065 --> 00:25:08,937
- Be careful?
- Yup, careful.

290
00:25:10,704 --> 00:25:13,007
Yeah, well you fuckers
deserve one another.

291
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:17,309
Okay, I'm gonna get
us out of here,

292
00:25:17,311 --> 00:25:20,177
and you're right,

293
00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:23,349
this... this is a chance
for a fresh start.

294
00:25:23,351 --> 00:25:27,186
So, I was thinking,

295
00:25:27,188 --> 00:25:29,988
remember in high school when
we'd have all those sleepovers

296
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,225
and they were really fun?

297
00:25:32,227 --> 00:25:36,896
I was thinking that we should
move in together.

298
00:25:36,898 --> 00:25:40,399
Like, we always talked about making
it happen but we never made it happen

299
00:25:40,401 --> 00:25:42,968
and now this could be our
chance.

300
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:46,907
We could go out to clubs and have
parties, and late night movies.

301
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:49,043
It would be so much fun.

302
00:25:49,045 --> 00:25:50,777
Steph, I can't.

303
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:53,680
You can't?
Why because of that asshole Jeb?

304
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:55,682
Don't say that,
he's my boyfriend.

305
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:59,018
You depend way too much on him.
He is a guy.

306
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,289
He will either hurt you,
or leave you, or both.

307
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:06,694
I am here to protect you from
those assholes,

308
00:26:06,696 --> 00:26:08,928
one day he's gonna be gone,

309
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,798
and then you will be
left with just me,

310
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,200
so you might as well
get used to it now.

311
00:26:13,202 --> 00:26:17,774
Because I am the only one who is there to pick
up the pieces when your life falls apart.

312
00:26:20,844 --> 00:26:22,779
I know.

313
00:26:28,184 --> 00:26:33,822
Steph, uh, I, um, I...

314
00:26:33,824 --> 00:26:36,893
Oh, my god, spit it out.
You know that drives me crazy.

315
00:26:38,462 --> 00:26:42,931
I just wanted to say that
I'm sorry Chad hurt you.

316
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:46,437
Oh. Thanks.

317
00:26:48,972 --> 00:26:51,940
I never understood why
you were with him.

318
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:54,209
He never treated you right.

319
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:57,848
I saw the marks no matter how
hard you tried to cover them up.

320
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:03,987
And the rumors that he was seeing
other girls and he just...

321
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,759
He made you so unhappy.

322
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:11,060
I always thought that you
deserved better.

323
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:14,331
Dave, he loves you.

324
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:18,367
I mean, he would do
anything for you.

325
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:24,176
And then there are days that...
you treat him so bad.

326
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:28,378
As bad as Chad treated you.

327
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,782
I mean, why?

328
00:27:30,884 --> 00:27:33,453
I don't... I don't get it.

329
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:40,059
Sometimes people do things that
don't make sense.

330
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:46,964
Okay, Dave is good.

331
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:49,937
He's funny and he's caring,

332
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:55,240
and he would do whatever
I say with a smile.

333
00:27:56,944 --> 00:28:00,945
Um, I love him,

334
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:02,948
I do.

335
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,020
But I will destroy him.

336
00:28:07,387 --> 00:28:09,389
That's not true.

337
00:28:10,425 --> 00:28:13,059
I deserved Chad.

338
00:28:13,061 --> 00:28:15,595
Can I ask you a question?

339
00:28:15,597 --> 00:28:17,066
Sure.

340
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:23,105
How did you kill him?

341
00:28:24,138 --> 00:28:25,305
I strangled him.

342
00:28:25,307 --> 00:28:27,206
Uh, no, I mean...

343
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:31,980
I know physically, like, how you
killed him, I mean, um...

344
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:40,454
What does it feel like
to take a life?

345
00:28:40,456 --> 00:28:42,058
Was it hard?

346
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:47,027
Power.

347
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:49,933
There is nothing like it.

348
00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:55,137
In that moment I felt...
powerful.

349
00:28:58,107 --> 00:29:02,112
So much anger built up.

350
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,583
I was unstoppable.

351
00:29:07,918 --> 00:29:09,484
You know, it sounds weird,

352
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:14,488
but I hope you get to experience
that for yourself one day.

353
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,092
Me? I...

354
00:29:17,427 --> 00:29:21,032
I don't think I could.

355
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,301
Oh, you can do it, Carrie.

356
00:29:25,303 --> 00:29:29,408
I mean, you are stronger
than you think you are.

357
00:30:16,623 --> 00:30:21,124
I even felt a little
bit guilty, but...

358
00:30:21,126 --> 00:30:24,362
every regretful thought
that I have

359
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:30,200
about killing that piece
of shit goes away

360
00:30:30,202 --> 00:30:35,673
because I know I did what I needed
to do in that moment to survive.

361
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:38,346
And I would do it again
in a heartbeat.

362
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:55,195
You think something's
out there?

363
00:31:12,013 --> 00:31:13,046
Hey, hey, what happened?

364
00:31:13,048 --> 00:31:14,646
Uh.

365
00:31:14,648 --> 00:31:16,281
Oh, geez.

366
00:31:16,283 --> 00:31:17,283
Are you okay?

367
00:31:17,285 --> 00:31:19,052
It's just a little prick.

368
00:31:19,054 --> 00:31:21,720
Yeah, I'll say it is.
Get the hell out of my hand.

369
00:31:21,722 --> 00:31:24,057
I'm sorry.

370
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:27,161
It's Joshua tree, it's just a piece of cactus.

371
00:31:27,163 --> 00:31:28,628
You're fine.

372
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,530
Great, okay, break's over.

373
00:31:30,532 --> 00:31:33,971
The sooner we get out of this
man-eating desert the better.

374
00:31:37,306 --> 00:31:41,375
Dave, you should have
printed out a memo.

375
00:31:41,377 --> 00:31:45,578
Yeah, next murder, I expect a full
breakdown of indigenous species,

376
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,317
plant life, oh, and, um,
restaurants.

377
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:52,386
Please, that would be
awesome next time.

378
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:55,092
I hope there's not a next time.

379
00:32:21,086 --> 00:32:22,087
Yep.

380
00:32:24,555 --> 00:32:26,557
Do you hear that?

381
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:30,225
Hello?

382
00:32:30,227 --> 00:32:32,662
There's a footstep...
there's a footstep out there.

383
00:32:32,664 --> 00:32:33,863
Okay, there's something
out there!

384
00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:34,764
I swear to God.

385
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:36,699
Did you not hear that?

386
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:39,602
Keep your cool, come on, just got
a little bit more ways to go.

387
00:32:39,604 --> 00:32:43,107
Shut up,
there's someone there.

388
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:44,444
What the fuck?

389
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:47,479
- What?
- What?

390
00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:03,128
What the fuck?
What the fuck happened?

391
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,532
- Holy shit!
- What the fuck?

392
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,505
Oh, fuck.

393
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:14,839
Are you fucking kidding me?

394
00:33:14,841 --> 00:33:16,340
Oh, my God.

395
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:18,142
What the fuck happened?

396
00:33:18,144 --> 00:33:20,777
No! Hey, hey! Shh! Don't fucking
do that shit, come on.

397
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:22,915
- I knew this would happen.
- No.

398
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:26,752
- I got you, okay.
- Jeb, how is this... how is this possible?

399
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:31,590
We're back where we started, how
is that even happening? I don't...

400
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,425
Hey, it's all right.

401
00:33:33,427 --> 00:33:36,762
Just stay here, okay?

402
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,796
Everything's gonna be fine,
all right?

403
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:40,466
Hey, everything's gonna be okay,

404
00:33:40,468 --> 00:33:42,668
all right? Hold this.

405
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,837
This is all your fucking fault.

406
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:46,672
How is this my fault,
Stephanie?

407
00:33:46,674 --> 00:33:49,708
We all went together like
it was your plan.

408
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:50,877
- Okay?
- Fucking retarded.

409
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:52,946
Everything's fine,
everyone's okay.

410
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:55,415
- What if I had fucking been here?
- How is this my...

411
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:57,684
What do you think would have
happened to me if you left me here?

412
00:33:57,686 --> 00:33:59,686
- Okay, good...
- Or Carrie and Jeb,

413
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:01,554
what do you think
would have happened to them?

414
00:34:01,556 --> 00:34:03,758
- How is this my fault?
- Are you kidding me?

415
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:11,665
I'm just helping you out,
Stephanie.

416
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,834
Yeah, a lot you've done.

417
00:34:13,836 --> 00:34:17,471
The car's dead. This is
amazing, you've helped so much,

418
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:22,643
I'm so happy that you're here
right now.

419
00:34:24,346 --> 00:34:26,614
Everything's fine.
Everyone's okay.

420
00:34:26,616 --> 00:34:29,584
Nobody's okay, we're in the middle
of nowhere with a dead fucking car!

421
00:34:35,693 --> 00:34:36,891
I haven't seen one
of these in forever.

422
00:34:36,893 --> 00:34:40,461
That is not mine.

423
00:34:40,463 --> 00:34:43,634
Why is that here?

424
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,340
Let's see what's
on this bad boy.

425
00:34:57,948 --> 00:35:01,486
Guys, that's us.

426
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,889
What the fuck?

427
00:35:08,593 --> 00:35:10,692
Someone's been fucking
watching us.

428
00:35:10,694 --> 00:35:12,597
I can't, I can't.

429
00:35:20,939 --> 00:35:23,609
Every single one of us.

430
00:35:25,344 --> 00:35:26,378
Our faces.

431
00:35:31,717 --> 00:35:33,016
Fucking shit.

432
00:35:33,018 --> 00:35:34,221
Carrie.

433
00:35:37,355 --> 00:35:39,225
Oh, no.

434
00:35:40,025 --> 00:35:42,228
Oh, fuck.

435
00:35:43,795 --> 00:35:46,799
What the fuck is he, man?

436
00:35:50,671 --> 00:35:53,006
Oh, fuck, dude.

437
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:58,878
Fuck.

438
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,735
We shouldn't have come here.

439
00:36:22,737 --> 00:36:26,339
Because of the Joshua tree.

440
00:36:26,341 --> 00:36:30,076
What about the Joshua tree?

441
00:36:30,078 --> 00:36:32,712
It only grows in two places,

442
00:36:32,714 --> 00:36:35,048
two places in the whole world.

443
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:39,785
Jerusalem, which is
the gateway to Heaven,

444
00:36:39,787 --> 00:36:43,090
and here,

445
00:36:43,092 --> 00:36:46,762
which is the
gateway to Hell.

446
00:36:48,063 --> 00:36:51,365
And I think that
we're being punished

447
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:53,466
because we did something
terrible

448
00:36:53,468 --> 00:36:55,570
and that's why we're here.

449
00:36:56,972 --> 00:37:00,310
And I think that we're
not gonna make it.

450
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:07,114
We don't
deserve to keep going,

451
00:37:07,116 --> 00:37:10,851
because we brought him here.

452
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:13,390
And we're all going to Hell.

453
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:24,535
It's over.

454
00:37:29,974 --> 00:37:32,410
We're all gonna die.

455
00:37:37,648 --> 00:37:39,651
We're gonna die.

456
00:37:42,452 --> 00:37:47,690
This is bullshit, this has
nothing to do with a tree.

457
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:48,694
No.

458
00:37:53,765 --> 00:37:56,632
It doesn't matter.

459
00:37:56,634 --> 00:37:59,536
There are two options,

460
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:01,471
either he's out there,

461
00:38:01,473 --> 00:38:03,172
heading towards the road,

462
00:38:03,174 --> 00:38:05,942
licking his wounds,

463
00:38:05,944 --> 00:38:08,581
just swearing off
crazy bitches forever,

464
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:15,186
or he's here,

465
00:38:15,188 --> 00:38:18,688
just plotting his revenge.

466
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,460
For what Stephanie
did to him.

467
00:38:23,195 --> 00:38:25,829
Then it's settled,

468
00:38:25,831 --> 00:38:27,664
we leave him here to rot.

469
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,885
Over there.

470
00:39:19,887 --> 00:39:21,052
Are you sure?

471
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:23,058
Of course I'm sure.

472
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:37,270
- Come out you motherfu...
- Stephanie, stop.

473
00:39:37,272 --> 00:39:39,573
I don't think you're
getting this,

474
00:39:39,575 --> 00:39:41,908
I'm not just gonna sit here and wait
for some asshole to toy with me.

475
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:46,014
If he wants a fight he can come
out here and I will give him one.

476
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,087
Can we just calm down?

477
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:55,590
It's probably just an animal.

478
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:56,627
You think?

479
00:39:58,261 --> 00:40:00,328
Yeah, I mean, it doesn't sound
like it's coming for us.

480
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,795
Does it?

481
00:40:01,797 --> 00:40:03,566
Well, yeah,
it's like a squirrel.

482
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:06,569
Yeah.

483
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:23,318
Okay, well,
nothing has changed.

484
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,256
We still need to get
to the main road and...

485
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,695
Wait, where's the camera?

486
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,735
You left a camera

487
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:42,072
showing all of us
bury a dead body

488
00:40:42,074 --> 00:40:45,308
in the front seat
of your truck!

489
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,648
What the hell?

490
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:52,281
Okay.

491
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,719
We all know how important
that camera is, right?

492
00:40:55,721 --> 00:40:59,190
So you know what
you need to do.

493
00:41:01,026 --> 00:41:02,927
Is anyone gonna come with me?

494
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:04,128
Oh, no, no.

495
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,731
We all know that you
fucked this up,

496
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:08,898
so you need to fix it.

497
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:13,003
We will wait right here.

498
00:41:13,005 --> 00:41:16,273
We'll be right here, Dave.
It's not that far.

499
00:41:16,275 --> 00:41:19,343
I'm pretty sure you can get
there and back in 20 minutes.

500
00:41:19,345 --> 00:41:23,348
All right, fine, but you
have to hold my jacket.

501
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:27,355
So I can do it,
just like I do everything else.

502
00:41:46,974 --> 00:41:49,941
How far do you think it is
to the road?

503
00:41:49,943 --> 00:41:51,309
No idea.

504
00:41:51,311 --> 00:41:53,746
Wait, Jeb has no idea
about something?

505
00:41:53,748 --> 00:41:56,182
I never thought that
would happen.

506
00:41:56,184 --> 00:41:58,918
Okay, you manipulative bitch,

507
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,220
you just sent Dave out alone,

508
00:42:01,222 --> 00:42:03,155
because you were too lazy
to do it yourself.

509
00:42:03,157 --> 00:42:05,825
It has nothing to do
with being too lazy.

510
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:10,698
I'm sorry. It has everything to do with your
sick and twisted need to control someone,

511
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,734
which in this moment,
you needed stroked.

512
00:42:13,736 --> 00:42:15,401
So you thought,
"I have an idea,

513
00:42:15,403 --> 00:42:19,073
I'll send Dave out into the
darkness alone for my pleasure."

514
00:42:19,075 --> 00:42:20,940
You know, you're a whole
different kind of monster...

515
00:42:20,942 --> 00:42:24,712
Okay, I'm going to tell you
something right now, I hate you.

516
00:42:24,714 --> 00:42:26,747
You think you're so much
better than everyone else,

517
00:42:26,749 --> 00:42:28,848
and you flaunt it around
the rest of us.

518
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:32,719
I can't wait until Carrie wakes
up and sees you for what you are.

519
00:42:32,721 --> 00:42:34,222
And what is that?

520
00:42:34,224 --> 00:42:37,891
A spineless loser by day
and sick pervert by night.

521
00:42:37,893 --> 00:42:41,396
The only reason we are in
this hell right now is

522
00:42:41,398 --> 00:42:43,334
because you thought a break up
was just a little too cliché.

523
00:42:46,068 --> 00:42:49,804
I will take being a spineless
loser over being a soulless cunt.

524
00:42:49,806 --> 00:42:50,808
Jeb!

525
00:42:51,808 --> 00:42:53,074
You suck, you know that?

526
00:42:53,076 --> 00:42:56,681
She's going to use you
all the time.

527
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,250
Yeah, I think I left that open,
right?

528
00:43:02,252 --> 00:43:05,189
Yeah, that's how I left it.

529
00:43:07,524 --> 00:43:10,292
Okay, um....

530
00:43:10,294 --> 00:43:12,030
Just need the camera,

531
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:17,468
and head back
and everything will be fine.

532
00:43:19,269 --> 00:43:21,272
Okay.

533
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,798
Oh, fuck.

534
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,468
Of course it's not here. Of
course, that's what happens.

535
00:44:06,553 --> 00:44:09,220
I brought my gat with me.

536
00:44:09,222 --> 00:44:11,956
It holds twelve bullets.

537
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:13,458
Bullets are expensive these days

538
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:17,061
but not... not like I'm
planning on not using them.

539
00:44:17,063 --> 00:44:19,531
I got this awesome, uh,

540
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:23,869
apache ax thing,

541
00:44:23,871 --> 00:44:26,070
that I used on the last
motherfuckers that messed with us!

542
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:35,148
Run! It's coming!

543
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,316
Run!

544
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:38,885
It's coming!

545
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:40,385
Just sort of waiting
for him to come back.

546
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:41,954
I don't even know if
he's gonna come back.

547
00:44:41,956 --> 00:44:43,155
Are you a psychiatrist?
Do you have a degree?

548
00:44:43,157 --> 00:44:44,990
- Yeah, I'm a psychiatrist.
- What do you have a degree in?

549
00:44:44,992 --> 00:44:46,526
Yes, I have a PhD in fuck you.

550
00:44:46,528 --> 00:44:51,430
Run! Run!

551
00:45:04,513 --> 00:45:07,080
I think we're okay.

552
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:08,582
No. Jeb! No!

553
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:11,888
Yes, Carrie, we have to go.

554
00:45:16,491 --> 00:45:21,296
Look, Carrie, I'm sorry,

555
00:45:21,298 --> 00:45:22,664
she was gonna hurt you,

556
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:24,965
and I'm not gonna
let that happen.

557
00:45:24,967 --> 00:45:27,401
She's a monster and I'm
gonna protect you from that.

558
00:45:27,403 --> 00:45:28,936
All right?

559
00:45:28,938 --> 00:45:30,604
Everything I'm doing,
from here on,

560
00:45:30,606 --> 00:45:33,110
is just for you,
for us.

561
00:45:42,052 --> 00:45:43,284
I'm sorry.

562
00:45:43,286 --> 00:45:45,922
All right?

563
00:45:45,924 --> 00:45:49,225
And look,
she murdered someone.

564
00:45:49,227 --> 00:45:52,227
Carrie, she invited him into her
house and she murdered him...

565
00:45:52,229 --> 00:45:54,562
No, she was defending herself.

566
00:45:54,564 --> 00:45:56,165
Is that what she told you?

567
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:59,004
That she was defending herself?

568
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:04,540
Then I guess, uh, he was
attacking her with his back,

569
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:07,576
because she murdered him
from behind, Carrie.

570
00:46:07,578 --> 00:46:11,149
That makes self-defense very
difficult to prove.

571
00:46:13,251 --> 00:46:16,219
No.

572
00:46:16,221 --> 00:46:18,224
You sound just like her.

573
00:46:21,025 --> 00:46:23,293
Come on,

574
00:46:23,295 --> 00:46:29,132
I did this for you because you
refuse to help yourself, all right?

575
00:46:29,134 --> 00:46:31,200
I love you,
I'm the one that loves you.

576
00:46:31,202 --> 00:46:33,538
Do you not understand that?

577
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,674
All right? I love you.

578
00:46:36,676 --> 00:46:40,111
But I'm getting us
the fuck out of here.

579
00:46:40,113 --> 00:46:41,279
Let's move.

580
00:46:45,318 --> 00:46:47,051
Hey, you okay?

581
00:46:47,053 --> 00:46:48,151
No.

582
00:46:48,153 --> 00:46:49,386
Why do you do that?

583
00:46:49,388 --> 00:46:50,455
Do what?

584
00:46:50,457 --> 00:46:52,256
You don't let me touch you.

585
00:46:52,258 --> 00:46:54,328
I just don't like being touched.

586
00:46:58,264 --> 00:46:59,530
You never give me a chance.

587
00:46:59,532 --> 00:47:01,699
What are you talking about?

588
00:47:01,701 --> 00:47:03,434
You know what I'm fucking
talking about.

589
00:47:03,436 --> 00:47:06,204
I've been here through
everything with you

590
00:47:06,206 --> 00:47:08,042
and you just treat me
like a house boy.

591
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,378
I always thought of you
as my friend.

592
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,347
I want more.

593
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:18,384
Can't you just be okay
with what we have?

594
00:47:18,386 --> 00:47:21,152
No! I can't, Steph.

595
00:47:21,154 --> 00:47:23,622
I have to see you with
all these guys

596
00:47:23,624 --> 00:47:25,524
and I have to pretend
I'm okay with it.

597
00:47:25,526 --> 00:47:28,361
You rub it in my face
and I have to be cool?

598
00:47:28,363 --> 00:47:30,263
You think I wanted this?

599
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:34,033
No girl wants a friend who's
constantly trying to screw her.

600
00:47:34,035 --> 00:47:35,801
It sucks.

601
00:47:35,803 --> 00:47:39,008
But you put yourself
in this position.

602
00:47:39,807 --> 00:47:41,774
I did this to myself, Steph?

603
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:44,477
Are you... are you serious?

604
00:47:44,479 --> 00:47:46,246
Really?

605
00:47:46,248 --> 00:47:50,150
Did you ever think that maybe...

606
00:47:50,152 --> 00:47:53,154
I was trying to save you
from something worse?

607
00:47:53,156 --> 00:47:54,822
Like what?

608
00:47:54,824 --> 00:47:56,193
Like what?

609
00:47:59,295 --> 00:48:01,494
What are you doing here, Dave?

610
00:48:01,496 --> 00:48:04,632
I mean, this isn't
a camping trip.

611
00:48:04,634 --> 00:48:06,766
I screwed up.

612
00:48:06,768 --> 00:48:10,504
Don't you think that
that could have been you?

613
00:48:10,506 --> 00:48:11,439
I wish it was.

614
00:48:11,441 --> 00:48:13,108
You don't mean that.

615
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:16,343
I have been here through
everything with you

616
00:48:16,345 --> 00:48:19,280
and this hurts so much.

617
00:48:19,282 --> 00:48:21,284
I'm sorry.

618
00:48:22,485 --> 00:48:24,586
It's not my fault.

619
00:48:24,588 --> 00:48:30,191
You need to understand that
nothing will ever happen bet...

620
00:48:32,695 --> 00:48:35,230
Fuck! My lip! Oh, fuck!

621
00:48:35,232 --> 00:48:36,531
Oh, you bitch.

622
00:48:36,533 --> 00:48:37,799
You didn't have to do that.

623
00:48:37,801 --> 00:48:38,868
Fuck!

624
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:41,406
Ugh!

625
00:48:42,507 --> 00:48:43,572
Uh, you bit my lip...

626
00:48:43,574 --> 00:48:46,109
You didn't have to do that.

627
00:48:48,513 --> 00:48:49,745
Oh, my God!

628
00:48:49,747 --> 00:48:50,880
Ah!

629
00:48:50,882 --> 00:48:52,518
Dave!

630
00:49:06,164 --> 00:49:08,231
Where is he?

631
00:49:08,233 --> 00:49:10,200
- I don't know, something took him.
- What's happened to him?

632
00:49:10,202 --> 00:49:11,668
I don't know,
something took him!

633
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:12,836
He tried to hurt me!

634
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:13,836
Dave did?

635
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:15,372
He tried to hurt me, Carrie.

636
00:49:15,374 --> 00:49:18,842
Something came out
and dragged him away.

637
00:49:18,844 --> 00:49:20,543
So you fucking killed him.

638
00:49:20,545 --> 00:49:22,446
No, I didn't.

639
00:49:22,448 --> 00:49:25,516
Something came out here
and dragged him away.

640
00:49:25,518 --> 00:49:26,683
So all this blood?

641
00:49:26,685 --> 00:49:28,919
That's just your blood,
right?

642
00:49:28,921 --> 00:49:31,288
'Cause it couldn't be Dave's blood
if something else took him.

643
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:33,493
Screw you, Jeb,
I am telling the truth.

644
00:49:35,428 --> 00:49:36,497
Then where did he go?

645
00:49:38,797 --> 00:49:40,765
We're getting out of here.

646
00:49:40,767 --> 00:49:42,600
Yeah, that's the
best idea you've had all night.

647
00:49:42,602 --> 00:49:45,537
I don't think you're
understanding me.

648
00:49:45,539 --> 00:49:48,110
You're not coming with us.

649
00:49:50,177 --> 00:49:52,443
Really?

650
00:49:52,445 --> 00:49:54,813
That's how this is
gonna go down?

651
00:49:54,815 --> 00:50:00,322
Years of friendship
ruined over a boy.

652
00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:04,456
I'm sorry, Steph.

653
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:08,394
You did this to yourself.

654
00:50:08,396 --> 00:50:11,698
No, don't you apologize to me.

655
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,667
I've been trying to warn you
about him from the beginning.

656
00:50:14,669 --> 00:50:17,370
He is going to hurt you, Carrie.

657
00:50:17,372 --> 00:50:20,506
He might try to give off that
nice guys finish last routine

658
00:50:20,508 --> 00:50:23,478
but he is just as much
a monster as I am.

659
00:50:26,247 --> 00:50:30,584
I wasn't lying when
I said you should be careful.

660
00:50:30,586 --> 00:50:32,987
That is not true,
don't say that.

661
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:36,456
She's not falling for it
anymore, Stephanie.

662
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:38,529
You're on your own.

663
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:42,764
Like it, Steph.

664
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:54,411
You're just as bad as she is!

665
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:58,549
Carrie!

666
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:42,261
Your kind,
and now you're all the same.

667
00:51:55,907 --> 00:51:58,344
Do it.

668
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:03,449
Please, I don't want to.

669
00:52:07,986 --> 00:52:12,857
Please,
I don't want to.

670
00:52:28,542 --> 00:52:30,975
Do it!

671
00:52:30,977 --> 00:52:34,546
Do it or I will!

672
00:52:34,548 --> 00:52:38,383
I just wanted her to love me.

673
00:52:38,385 --> 00:52:42,354
I just wanted her
to love me.

674
00:52:42,356 --> 00:52:44,523
Do it!

675
00:52:44,525 --> 00:52:47,528
I just wanted her
to love me!

676
00:52:50,597 --> 00:52:52,601
I just wanted her
to love me!

677
00:52:53,735 --> 00:52:57,072
I just wanted
her to love me!

678
00:53:10,685 --> 00:53:12,689
Love me.

679
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:53,631
Whoever you are,
I hope you're happy.

680
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:56,633
Because you ruined my life.

681
00:53:57,635 --> 00:53:59,636
Now what have you seen?

682
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:56,028
You caused me so much pain.

683
00:54:58,998 --> 00:55:01,002
Look what you did to me!

684
00:55:02,134 --> 00:55:03,970
Look at me!

685
00:57:11,403 --> 00:57:15,005
Please, sit down, Carrie.

686
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:20,745
I'm not really
happy right now.

687
00:57:20,747 --> 00:57:25,049
I'm sad.

688
00:57:25,051 --> 00:57:29,890
Tell me about your friend Dave.
What's he like?

689
00:57:31,089 --> 00:57:33,890
- Again?
- Shut up, Carrie.

690
00:57:33,892 --> 00:57:35,725
Do you like your friends?

691
00:57:35,727 --> 00:57:37,995
Yeah.

692
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:40,031
Why are you even talking
to this idiot?

693
00:57:40,033 --> 00:57:43,734
You want to tell me about Dave?

694
00:57:43,736 --> 00:57:48,173
Dave...

695
00:57:48,175 --> 00:57:51,409
nice.

696
00:57:51,411 --> 00:57:55,213
He's in love with Stephanie.

697
00:57:55,215 --> 00:57:57,382
Well, what about Stephanie?

698
00:57:57,384 --> 00:57:59,851
Is she nice to you?

699
00:57:59,853 --> 00:58:01,856
Stop talking.

700
00:58:04,925 --> 00:58:08,393
Stephanie can be nice.

701
00:58:08,395 --> 00:58:13,198
She doesn't really
like to be.

702
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,305
She thinks that people take
advantage of girls who are nice.

703
00:58:18,707 --> 00:58:21,176
Does Stephanie like Jeb?

704
00:58:22,843 --> 00:58:25,410
I wish she did.

705
00:58:25,412 --> 00:58:28,147
God, you're gonna
ruin everything.

706
00:58:28,149 --> 00:58:29,716
She hates Jeb.

707
00:58:29,718 --> 00:58:31,350
They're gonna lock us up

708
00:58:31,352 --> 00:58:32,920
and they know what we did.

709
00:58:32,922 --> 00:58:34,487
They know we're responsible.

710
00:58:34,489 --> 00:58:39,726
...because I like him.

711
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:43,831
Do you think that
Stephanie would ever hurt Jeb?

712
00:58:43,833 --> 00:58:46,836
I hope not.

713
00:58:49,438 --> 00:58:50,938
I should go...

714
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,440
I... I... I need to...
I need to go.

715
00:58:53,442 --> 00:58:55,375
Do you think that
Stephanie would hurt you?

716
00:58:55,377 --> 00:58:58,213
No! I... She's my friend,

717
00:58:58,215 --> 00:59:01,218
she wouldn't do that.

718
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:05,285
But could she hurt you?

719
00:59:05,287 --> 00:59:08,388
Carrie,
you stupid fucking bitch!

720
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:10,524
If you say anything,
I swear to God...

721
00:59:10,526 --> 00:59:12,729
She's my friend.

722
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:19,704
All friends can hurt you
if they really wanted to.

723
00:59:24,275 --> 00:59:28,210
You were my only friend.

724
00:59:28,212 --> 00:59:31,216
Now you're just like
everybody else.

725
00:59:34,252 --> 00:59:38,087
Carrie,
I'm gonna find you.

726
00:59:38,089 --> 00:59:39,822
I'm gonna find you

727
00:59:39,824 --> 00:59:44,226
and I'm gonna make you hurt
for what you did to me.

728
00:59:44,228 --> 00:59:48,231
I'm gonna make you bleed.

729
00:59:48,233 --> 00:59:54,073
I'm gonna find you.

730
01:00:43,289 --> 01:00:45,459
Is that you Dave?

731
01:00:49,362 --> 01:00:51,865
Who is that?
Who's there?

732
01:00:57,171 --> 01:00:59,906
Who is that?

733
01:00:59,908 --> 01:01:01,607
It's okay.

734
01:01:01,609 --> 01:01:04,611
Don't be afraid.

735
01:01:04,613 --> 01:01:07,482
Oh, my God.

736
01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:12,484
We thought you were dead.

737
01:01:12,486 --> 01:01:17,091
I don't know what I am.

738
01:01:23,532 --> 01:01:25,999
We did this to you?

739
01:01:26,001 --> 01:01:28,568
No.

740
01:01:28,570 --> 01:01:32,273
I tried to leave her,

741
01:01:32,275 --> 01:01:36,546
she's so much worse
than I realized.

742
01:01:37,646 --> 01:01:41,481
I am so sorry, Chad.

743
01:01:41,483 --> 01:01:46,087
You... have to stop her.

744
01:01:46,089 --> 01:01:47,689
I can't, she's...

745
01:01:47,691 --> 01:01:49,894
She's a killer.

746
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:54,930
Hey.

747
01:01:54,932 --> 01:01:56,665
It's okay.

748
01:01:56,667 --> 01:01:58,600
It's gonna be okay.

749
01:01:58,602 --> 01:02:03,671
She's only strong when
you follow her.

750
01:02:03,673 --> 01:02:06,877
She needs you to follow her.

751
01:02:10,213 --> 01:02:12,217
It's gonna be okay,
okay?

752
01:02:13,351 --> 01:02:15,951
It'll be okay.

753
01:02:15,953 --> 01:02:19,989
I promise.

754
01:02:19,991 --> 01:02:25,193
Friendship is the truest bond.

755
01:02:25,195 --> 01:02:27,596
A spear against my friend is a dagger in your spine.

756
01:02:27,598 --> 01:02:30,498
A spear against my friend is
a dagger in your spine.

757
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,636
A spear against my friend
is a dagger in your spine.

758
01:02:33,638 --> 01:02:37,107
A spear against my friend is
a dagger in your spine.

759
01:02:58,732 --> 01:03:00,697
I never thought
you'd have it in you.

760
01:03:00,699 --> 01:03:03,937
- Steph?
- That was fantastic.

761
01:03:05,572 --> 01:03:07,438
I'd like to think
I played a little part in that,

762
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,311
I mean, I have been
nurturing you for yours.

763
01:03:11,511 --> 01:03:14,145
He hurt you, didn't he?

764
01:03:14,147 --> 01:03:18,282
Yeah, he did, but he was mine
to hurt back and now he's gone.

765
01:03:18,284 --> 01:03:21,519
No, I...
I did this for you.

766
01:03:21,521 --> 01:03:24,522
Oh, I know you did,
sweetie,

767
01:03:24,524 --> 01:03:27,292
and I couldn't be
more proud.

768
01:03:27,294 --> 01:03:30,298
So what do we do now?

769
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:34,733
Whatever we want.

770
01:03:34,735 --> 01:03:37,202
I mean, you proved
yourself tonight.

771
01:03:37,204 --> 01:03:40,071
You proved that you can do way
more than I gave you credit for.

772
01:03:40,073 --> 01:03:42,441
Well, Steph,

773
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:44,743
I don't know what I would
have done without you.

Why? Why? Why?

Carrie!

A spear against my friend is

798
01:09:00,774 --> 01:09:02,310
What's Dave like?

799
01:09:04,077 --> 01:09:05,977
Tell me about your friend.

800
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:07,982
Could she hurt you?

801
01:09:23,698 --> 01:09:25,499
Could she hurt you?

802
01:09:25,501 --> 01:09:27,000
No.

803
01:09:27,002 --> 01:09:30,006
I... She's my friend,
she wouldn't do that.

804
01:09:53,096 --> 01:09:55,899
Wait!

805
01:09:57,033 --> 01:09:59,666
They're all dead.

806
01:09:59,668 --> 01:10:02,002
Dave, Carrie.

807
01:10:02,004 --> 01:10:03,539
Well, we're alive.

808
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:08,476
And you think we're going
to make it out of this?

809
01:10:08,478 --> 01:10:14,049
Everything that happened
here is because of you!

810
01:10:14,051 --> 01:10:16,685
You dragged us into this

811
01:10:16,687 --> 01:10:18,987
and you're going
to die here,

812
01:10:18,989 --> 01:10:22,791
with us.

813
01:13:44,169 --> 01:13:46,037
Wake up.

814
01:13:46,039 --> 01:13:48,338
Wake up.

815
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,707
Wake up.

816
01:13:50,709 --> 01:13:54,045
Wake up.

817
01:13:54,047 --> 01:13:57,881
Wake up.
Wake up.

818
01:13:57,883 --> 01:14:00,117
Wake up.

819
01:14:00,119 --> 01:14:02,286
Wake up.

820
01:14:02,288 --> 01:14:04,822
All right, good.

821
01:14:04,824 --> 01:14:06,823
You're okay.
You're safe.

822
01:14:06,825 --> 01:14:10,630
You're safe, it's okay.

823
01:14:11,432 --> 01:14:13,431
It's remarkable.

824
01:14:13,433 --> 01:14:16,967
From the last hour's
experiments, it's clear,

825
01:14:16,969 --> 01:14:22,473
that Miss Thompson has completely broken
free from any psychological barriers,

826
01:14:22,475 --> 01:14:26,378
that hold acute
personalities independent.

827
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:30,481
What we've accomplished
here is the first steps

828
01:14:30,483 --> 01:14:38,925
in finding a psychological cure for
the most aggressive mental illnesses.

829
01:14:55,309 --> 01:14:58,246
It looks like you've
made it back.

830
01:15:04,854 --> 01:15:08,354
Do you think the
process worked, Doctor?

831
01:15:08,356 --> 01:15:10,793
There's no doubt in
my mind it worked.

832
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:18,034
But it's too early to tell
what benefit it's had on her.

833
01:15:22,972 --> 01:15:25,806
Carrie,

834
01:15:25,808 --> 01:15:30,246
I know it's gonna take you
some time to process this.

835
01:15:31,882 --> 01:15:37,085
And it's not gonna be easy,
but I assure you,

836
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:41,555
that it will get easier
when you see...

837
01:15:41,557 --> 01:15:45,194
Chad, and Dave, and Jeb,

838
01:15:45,196 --> 01:15:48,433
and Stephanie
for what they are.

839
01:15:52,536 --> 01:15:57,208
I understand this is
not gonna be easy.

840
01:15:59,076 --> 01:16:03,148
You've lived with these
people for some time.

841
01:16:05,116 --> 01:16:07,315
But it's time.

842
01:16:07,317 --> 01:16:11,856
It's time to break free.

843
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:17,263
What would you like me to
put in the report, Doctor?

844
01:16:19,031 --> 01:16:20,032
Yes.

845
01:16:24,937 --> 01:16:27,469
As of today,

846
01:16:27,471 --> 01:16:32,509
I believe we've successfully
eradicated half the personalities

847
01:16:32,511 --> 01:16:34,914
that Carrie had created.

848
01:16:37,449 --> 01:16:41,384
At this moment we can't
tell whether,

849
01:16:41,386 --> 01:16:44,390
they're lying dormant,
or gone completely.

850
01:16:47,126 --> 01:16:51,027
My professional opinion would be
that she was able to

851
01:16:51,029 --> 01:16:56,535
break down the less
aggressive personalities.

852
01:16:56,537 --> 01:17:04,209
Furthermore, the personality
that calls herself Stephanie,

853
01:17:04,211 --> 01:17:07,312
was able to remain.

854
01:17:07,314 --> 01:17:10,248
I feel that a strong
anti-psychotic

855
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:13,085
and sedative regiment

856
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:18,055
should reduce the chances
of that personality becoming...

857
01:17:18,057 --> 01:17:19,394
violent.

858
01:17:20,395 --> 01:17:24,296
Is there anything else?

859
01:17:24,298 --> 01:17:28,902
I believe we must continue
this course of action.

860
01:17:28,904 --> 01:17:32,271
If there's any chance
of Miss Thompson

861
01:17:32,273 --> 01:17:36,509
ever leaving this institution,

862
01:17:36,511 --> 01:17:41,584
but I believe she has it
in her to succeed.

863
01:17:44,987 --> 01:17:47,624
What... happened?

864
01:17:49,224 --> 01:17:52,228
Where am I?

865
01:18:02,103 --> 01:18:07,207
I hope you can hear me,
Stephanie.

866
01:18:07,209 --> 01:18:11,646
The next time Carrie comes
to me for treatment,

867
01:18:11,648 --> 01:18:14,581
I'm going to rip you
out of her

868
01:18:14,583 --> 01:18:18,421
like the cancer you are.

869
01:18:22,425 --> 01:18:26,160
I know you can hear me,
Stephanie.

870
01:18:26,162 --> 01:18:28,064
Say something.

871
01:18:32,136 --> 01:18:34,373
And there was silence.

872
01:18:43,081 --> 01:18:44,416
Is that her tongue?

873
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:51,323
Get a nurse!
Get the nurse!

874
