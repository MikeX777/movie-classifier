1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,200
Previously on Kings

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,100
When i read the signs in my life,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,000
they say that I was
sent here to help you.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Then do that.

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,300
They only use people like us.
Look what they do.

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,500
Make me wait all day to get
paid because my son died.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,900
We will in six months' time

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,600
Give over port prosperity
in exchange for lasting peace.

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,000
Why are you cutting him out?

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,300
Because he is taking up
too much attention.

11
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,000
- He's a good person.
- He's not that virtuous.

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,200
No one is.

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,200
I've been keeping pictures of our
family Out of the free press for years.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,200
Being king is a young man's game
And silas is growing old.

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,000
We need to know we have
a replacement at the ready.

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,200
What do you call it
when i go to the countryside?

17
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,500
We say you're in serenity.

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,700
Then serenity ends.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,300
Silas.

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,100
Silas.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,800
Lucky for the rain.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,600
Silks came in.

23
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,600
20 days or so we'll be ready to harvest.

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,600
What do you mean we, city boy?

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,100
You gonna give up your parades
and princesses And get your hands dirty?

26
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,800
King only gave me a 48-Hour furlough.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,300
Figures.

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,700
Ethan.

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,300
Why did you send back my check?

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,600
I don't want silas' money.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,400
You don't have to step up for eli alone.

32
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,300
He was my brother too.

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,300
Boys!

34
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,300
Come on in!

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,200
So anybody been in the tabloids lately?

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,800
shut it.

37
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,300
Daniel. Table.

38
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,200
I just want to check the score.

39
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,200
...Gilboa and gath.

40
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,700
- A future in which our people--
- Why is the king on every channel?

41
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,300
...Instead of bullets and bombs.

42
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,400
Port prosperity,

43
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,500
a city once conquered From gath
now pledged by me for return,

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,500
Carrying their pledge for peace.

45
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,600
No lean sacrifice, but fair.

46
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,800
In order to safeguard that pledge,

47
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,500
I know make public our intention To
return to gath not just port prosperity,

48
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,200
But all territory taken
in the battle of prosperity

49
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,000
- Including lands north of the river.
- That's us.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,900
- ???
- He just gave away our home.

51
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,300
Redraw our own map,
make our face ugly.

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,500
You have to talk him out of this.

53
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
- Me?
- You're his hero.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,700
He doesn't listen to people like me.

55
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,500
If he won't, others will.
You could speak out.

56
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,900
You need to try, david.

57
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,900
...As the city builds up
its infrastructure to house...

58
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,700
This is not a policy.

59
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
This is a decree.

60
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,700
This may well be our king's right,
But it is not just.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,200
He calls for peace,

62
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,000
But denies me the cost.

63
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,100
Good day to be a critic.

64
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,600
This criticism will
embolden your enemies.

65
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,900
How should we proceed?

66
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,500
- Sir.
- Captain shepherd.

67
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,600
You were with your family
when i made my announcement.

68
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,200
How did they react to my decree?

69
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,000
They feel betrayed, sir.

70
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,700
My father and brother
died to defend our home

71
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,200
And you just gave it
to the ones who killed them.

72
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,200
There must be something else
we can trade with gath

73
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
To preserve the border towns.

74
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,000
- You could postpone--
- You were not brought here

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,300
to debate the merit Of my decisions.

76
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,000
Only to determine the
position of your loyalty.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,700
With your family. With your king.

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,300
- I see both sides.
- Oh, both sides amounts to neither.

79
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,600
David,

80
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,300
do you believe that there are
forces Beyond our understanding

81
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,900
That have given me this role?

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,800
I believe you were chosen
king for a reason.

83
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,800
And when i ask you
to trust me, will you?

84
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,100
Port prosperity has called a forum.

85
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,300
You will go and publicly
endorse the king's position.

86
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,600
No one cares what i think.
My family will disown me.

87
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,100
Which is why the people
will care what you think.

88
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,800
To see you of all sacrifice
to your king will sway others.

89
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,900
And if it doesn't?

90
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,500
Then you will identify anyone attempting
To undermine the king's decision

91
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,300
And bring them to my attention.

92
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,400
We will have peace.

93
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,400
And those who obstruct it are
wolves Carving out my flock for food.

94
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,800
David, your family may not like it,

95
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,800
But your king needs your help.

You worry where you shouldn't.
Don't rush lines on your face, hmm?

100
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,100
The handover of port prosperity
will proceed as planned.

101
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,900
Unless the people won't allow it.

102
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,200
People will cool off
just like this omelet.

103
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,500
Now come on, sit down.
We're going to eat.

104
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,200
They're already starting to protest.

105
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,400
You don't care what
your people say about you?

106
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,800
A handful grumbling at the press.
No cause for alarm.

107
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,900
A healthy exercising of the freedoms
I'm pretty sure i gave them.

108
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,800
You should put down your apron
And go to their rally at prosperity.

109
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,100
Show them their king still cares.

110
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,000
I prefer it when you harp on healthcare.

111
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,500
Yeah, well i know how it
feels to not be heard.

112
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,200
The people cannot have
what they want at every turn.

113
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,300
Neither can you.

114
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,000
That's the definition
of governing and parenting.

115
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,700
My presence there would only inflame.

116
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,200
Besides, i got the
situation under control.

117
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,900
I sent my best man.

118
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,600
Who?

119
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,600
Silas didn't listen, did he?

120
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,000
He's not gonna budge.

121
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,800
We'll set him straight.

122
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,300
I'm glad you're with us.

123
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,000
I skipped breakfast.

124
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,700
Even when i'm pissed at
him I take the omelet.

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,100
Thanks for the support.

126
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,000
Trying to change his mind?

127
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,000
You'd have an easier time
asking the rain to stop.

128
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,300
Uniform, please.

129
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,500
I've run out of ways to please him.

130
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,300
He's used to everyone loving him.

131
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,900
He doesn't see as well as he used to.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,500
Or maybe he just doesn't care.

133
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,100
He would if he understood.
This is different.

134
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,700
They're already calling it "port calamity."

135
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,500
People are gathering
right now to protest this.

136
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,100
- Really? Who is?
- Plenty.

137
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,100
That's just awful.

138
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,800
Well, if you really want to help him,

139
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,900
Maybe some criticism
is exactly what he needs.

140
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,700
You have the air of a man
who's made a decision.

141
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,500
Not yet, uncle.

142
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,000
I made you an offer, jack.

143
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,600
You've left me waiting for an answer.

144
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,100
How about a token then?
Something to help me make up my mind.

145
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,100
You're buying unity news network.

146
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,000
Huh. You read the paper?

147
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,300
Why is everyone surprised
when i pay attention?

148
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,300
It's the largest news station
in the country And it's yours.

149
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,200
I want a hand in it.

150
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,200
"Buy me a toy, uncle."

151
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,200
But news doesn't seem your speed.

152
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,200
Or yours.

153
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Maybe we're both just sad About
the state of free press in shiloh.

154
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,600
- It's a crime.
- Shameful.

155
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,900
My father needs the media today.

156
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,800
If i were the one controlling
his public image...

157
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,400
He'd have to give you more
than scraps from the table.

158
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,900
He'd have to kiss my ass.

159
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,300
Is this what it'll take?

160
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,400
The price of your support
against your father?

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,800
We need our man
at the turn of history, jack.

162
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,100
We need our new king and soon.

163
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,500
Let's just say this
will help me make my decision.

164
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,100
I can't believe he did this!
From a damned coffee pot!

165
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,500
You stood where the poor man was serving.

166
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,200
Well, he should've anticipated.

167
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,800
Have him hung.

168
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,700
Hanged.

169
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,400
Laundry is hung.

170
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,900
Valets are hanged.

171
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,900
And so are queens...
who correct their husbands.

172
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,700
- What?
- Sir, your meeting.

173
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,500
Oh, haven't i got enough
on my head today?

174
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,000
Didn't i ask that rescheduled?

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,600
- It was.
- Well, do it again.

176
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,000
I have.

177
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Shall i put miss ghent off a third time?

178
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,000
Katrina ghent?

179
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,100
Well.

180
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Now i see why she donated
so generously At first night.

181
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,300
- What does she want?
- Well, i can live with the mystery.

182
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,100
Send her away.

183
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,100
Centerfold, december, '95.

184
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,400
- April, '96.
- December. Snow boots.

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Definitely furry snow boots.
I've seen better.

186
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,800
- Who?
- Miss ghent,

187
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,100
the king has to reschedule.

188
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,400
Then i got dressed today for no reason.

189
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,700
- Our sincerest apologies.
- Save the apology.

190
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,400
Name the price.

191
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,200
I need an audience with the king
And you're the dragon at every gate.

192
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,900
- Even dragons eat.
- Ma'am.

193
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,100
Oh, come, woman. I have too
much money not to give you some.

194
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,700
Think that as a donation
towards your sister's care.

195
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,400
That institution can't be cheap.

196
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,100
- You're underestimated.
- And right tired of it.

197
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,700
Last chance.

198
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,200
No?

199
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,400
you're a very good dragon.

200
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,000
- Where are we supposed to go?
- Premiere, what about our jobs?

201
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,600
They're talking about a
resettlement package For everyone.

202
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,300
New homes, new jobs.

203
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,500
The port at pella's being expanded
To route all shipping and dock work.

204
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
He can't do that to us.

205
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,300
My brother works for the king
and even he's here with us.

206
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,100
Captain shepherd. Captain.

207
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,700
We all saw how you took out that tank

208
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,200
And we're all proud
that you come from around here.

209
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,800
My family lives north of the river.

210
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,900
We'll be asked to move just like you.

211
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,300
So do you think the king is right?

212
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,500
I hate the idea of losing our home.

213
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,900
I lost my father.

214
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,200
My brother.

215
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,400
I know a lot of you here
lost people too.

216
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,100
And it's natural to say

217
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,600
they died for this land
And we're never giving it up.

218
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,200
That's right.

219
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,500
But i'd happily trade our
farm to bring dad or eli back.

220
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,200
Lives are more important than livelihood.

221
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,600
I think of all the other
fathers and brothers

222
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,400
Who are gonna go on living
because silas ended the war

223
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,300
And it makes me love our king even more.

224
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,100
What will your king do if we refuse?

225
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,600
Will he forcefully evict
us out of our homes?

226
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,700
As i understand it,

227
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,400
If you choose to stay
you'll be living in gath.

228
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,000
God gave us this land!

229
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,000
And not even silas can take it away!

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,100
???Yeah!

231
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,100
Who will stand with me
Against the king?

232
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,200
- ethan, Ethan, stop.
- Our blood! Our land!

233
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,700
- Our blood! Our land!
- Don't do this!

234
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,300
- our blood! Our land!
- Stop!

235
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,100
our blood! Our land!

236
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,500
Our blood! Our land!

237
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
Our blood! Our land!

238
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Our blood! Our land!

239
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,400
Our blood! Our land!

240
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Our blood! Our land!

241
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,400
Polls indicating
overwhelming public support

242
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,700
For king silas' decision
to return port prosperity--

243
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,800
This is where it happens.

244
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,400
Where the news gets crafted,

245
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,300
Then run by your father every day.

246
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,700
It looks so...honest.

247
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,400
Maybe you can make it more so.

248
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,600
I've benefitted more than any.

249
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,600
But this country needs
an information source

250
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,000
That won't kneel to
the king's approval.

251
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,100
The first town crier to cry freely.

252
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,400
Your father will be so proud.

253
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,000
Port prosperity.

254
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,800
...Directly affected by
the handover of port prosperity.

255
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,600
Let's bring in some criticism.

256
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,900
Give voice to the opposition.

257
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,500
Those who think he's being unkind
To our gentle heartlanders.

258
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,500
Yes. You listen to him.

259
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,000
We'll make the king look foolish.

260
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,200
Hmm. And later in the day

261
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,300
When he looks foolish still And he
tells all the other cameras to leave,

262
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,500
You tell ours to stay.

263
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,300
...Peaceful protest at
the docks of port prosperity.

264
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,400
I'm going to port prosperity.

265
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,200
I'm not sure that's advisable.

266
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,000
Just do it.

267
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,900
- Thank you.
- Mm-Hmm.

268
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,100
- Thank you.
- Oh, well thank you all.

269
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,400
- Thank you.
- We're so proud.

270
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,200
Next time, lorem, to the championships.

271
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,600
I'm from the south, and in case
you'd forgotten We hate lorem.

272
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,700
Now you're king.
You don't have a favorite team.

273
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,800
I used to break things
when they'd win.

274
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,000
Sir, the protest at port prosperity.

275
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,800
My daughter's already
bent my ear on this.

276
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Still it--It might be prudent
To call an emergency meeting.

277
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,400
We did something that was
unpopular but necessary.

278
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,100
There are those that
will pitch their fits.

279
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,500
I've dispatched captain shepherd.

280
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,100
I trust him to do
all the situation requires.

281
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,200
Perhaps i'm not making
the situation clear, sir.

282
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,600
The protestors are threatening
to shut down the port.

283
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,200
- This is--
- This is a tantrum.

284
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,500
I will not be drawn in.

285
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,000
Keep your mood where it is.
Your staff will dust off the guillotine.

286
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,300
Hmm?

287
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,200
Take a bath. Read a book. Fire someone.

288
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,200
But this new habit of barking
at every shadow Is unsustainable.

289
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,500
What about the countryside?

290
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,400
Hmm?

291
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,200
You always come back so refreshed
And likeable when you go there.

292
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,200
Time for a trip, hmm?

293
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,000
- Trip?
- um.

294
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,500
Not a bad idea.

295
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,100
Thomasina.

296
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
Let's go get some air.

297
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,700
Reverend, a word?

298
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,300
William cross come to my congregation.

299
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,300
Now i really have seen everything.

300
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,400
Don't get your hopes up, ephram.
It's you i've come to see. Not him.

301
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,700
I will always hope for you.

302
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,800
Change is in the air.

303
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,800
Like winter.

304
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,200
Can you smell the wood burning?

305
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,600
I have.

306
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,500
Silas will fall.

307
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,300
That may be his fate.

308
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,300
- Someday.
- Someday soon maybe.

309
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,600
And i want to know
when that time comes

310
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,300
If you can set aside our differences
And do what is best for the people.

311
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,000
Like we did once when we were young
And saw a king in silas.

312
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,400
You and did not make silas king.

313
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,900
Ha.

314
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,400
Funny. I don't remember
him writing any checks.

315
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,600
Minds are gathering.

316
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,600
Resources.

317
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,900
More every day.

318
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,900
A group will be meeting
to consider the season.

319
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,600
We'd like you to join us.

320
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,800
Time to be young again.

321
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,000
God...

322
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,100
Will choose the next king of this realm.

323
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,500
Not you.

324
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,700
Then ask you boss who he's chosen.

325
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,700
Line thrown out. Trout brought in.

326
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,800
Necessity turned to pastime.

327
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,300
Mediated by luck.
Attributed to skill.

328
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,300
It's all in the wrist, you know.

329
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,600
Sir, we have reports.
The press is aware you're here.

330
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Oh, you two!

331
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,700
All nervous, huh?

332
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,800
Hanson, you're like a cat at the
edge of the tub. Let a man relax.

333
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,100
Sir.

334
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,100
A bad time?

335
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,500
Seems you have your audience.

336
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,700
I don't blame you for avoiding me,

337
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,200
The notorious katrina ghent,
tabloid staple.

338
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,900
Who clearly doesn't deserve a word of it.

339
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,700
So i married for money.

340
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,000
He was a syphilitic walrus.

341
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Explain the intrusion
before i sit you on my fish.

342
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,800
I sold my reputation
for a lot of money.

343
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,400
I want to buy it back.

344
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,500
Make me a minister in your boardroom.

345
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,300
A minister?

346
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,400
Do you have any special
qualifications I should know about?

347
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,400
- An area of expertise?
- Oh, you pick.

348
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,200
I don't care about power.

349
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,300
Assign whoever you want to run
the thing And tell me my mind.

350
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,000
I just want a seat at the table.

351
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,300
You're offering to buy a ministry.

352
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,200
And overpay.

353
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,100
Unlucky for you, There's no positions
in my government For sale today.

354
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,900
But i admire forthrightness.

355
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,700
So i'm going to pardon you For
trying to bribe a sovereign while wet.

356
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,700
Good day, mrs. Ghent.

357
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,800
The situation could explode
at any minute And he's fishing.

358
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,300
With her.

359
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,700
He's not himself.

360
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,800
Law enforcement has been on
the scene As a precautionary measure.

361
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,800
But it appears the situation
is escalating In port prosperity.

362
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,300
Our land! God's land!

363
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,600
Our land! God's land!

364
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,100
- Our land! God's land!
- Don't put this on god.

365
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,300
You don't really believe that.

366
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,300
- I believe in our family.
- So do i!

367
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,700
Come on. You sold us out
for the palace life.

368
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,900
Our land! God's land! Our land!

369
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,200
You lost yourself. You're a traitor.

370
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,000
- God's land!
- We're not going anywhere!

371
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,300
Ethan!

372
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,000
Ethan!

373
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,000
Ethan!

374
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,700
Ethan!

375
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,700
Come on!

376
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,500
- Block the door!
- Block the door!

377
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,800
What were you thinking?

378
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,600
You slew your goliath.
Maybe silas is mine.

379
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,800
This isn't a competition,
ethan.

380
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Fighting over the good spot
on the couch. This is real.

381
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
What are you doing?

382
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,100
What we have to.

383
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,500
They shot first
into an unarmed crowd.

384
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,600
We have the right
to defend ourselves.

385
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,300
This was never a rally,
was it?

386
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,100
You planned an insurrection.

387
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,000
Silas didn't give us a choice.

388
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,000
We're gonna shut
down the whole port.

389
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,900
Stop everything from moving.

390
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,100
Now we have the whole world watching.

391
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,700
We'll be here every day humiliating him,
until he does right by us,

392
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
By our country.

393
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,200
Or he could just kill you,
ethan.

394
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,600
Killing us will turn
the whole country against him.

395
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,500
We've tied his hands.

396
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,700
You go out there
and you tell 'em

397
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,900
We won't stand for it.

398
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,600
We want our god-Given land back.

399
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,100
And we want the freedom
to live on it.

400
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,600
We have an update
from port prosperity.

401
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,700
They barricaded themselves And sent
captain shepherd out with a statement.

402
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,900
"We've fought for the king
and spilled our blood,

403
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,700
But if he tries to take our land
We will fight against him."

404
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,100
Local police have requested
military assistance.

405
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,600
They don't need it.

406
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,900
At last count, one is dead,
31 injured.

407
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,700
- Shepherd reports a compliment of guns.
- They can play at soldiers all they want.

408
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,700
We will not get involved.

409
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,600
Sir.

410
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,700
I have concern.

411
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,100
For your heart.

412
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,700
Doctor gave it
a clean bill just winter.

413
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,300
Not the function.

414
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,200
The temperature.

415
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,200
I fear it's gone cold.

416
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,500
Since serenity, sir.
Since you stopped going.

417
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,200
I know of no such place.

418
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,000
So it seems.

419
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,200
You have a point?

420
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,500
Without it...

421
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,300
Without her,

422
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,100
You have not been yourself as..

423
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,600
as i know you.

424
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,800
What you spite sharply
escapes notice.

425
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,400
And what gave
you pause doesn't.

426
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,900
And without the countervalence
of warmth,

427
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,200
You've grown mean, sir.

428
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,200
And i don't know how
to serve this cold silas.

429
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,500
And my duty is
to protect the family.

430
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,800
Then do it from the car.

431
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,000
How heavily armed
are the rebels?

432
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,700
They're not rebels.

433
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,500
They're people like you and me just
trying to make a point for the cameras.

434
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,100
The mayor just ordered us
to go in and shut them down.

435
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,700
No, you can't move in on the building.
We need to wait the protestors out.

436
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,500
I'm taking my orders
from the mayor now.

437
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,400
You take your orders
from the king.

438
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,400
I'm going in to speak
on his behalf.

439
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,200
What are you doing?

440
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,800
I'm gonna give them a chance
to save themselves

441
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,400
And show them someone still cares.

442
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
I care.

443
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600
My brother ethan is in there.

444
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,800
I can't let you do this.
This--This isn't your place.

445
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Michelle.

446
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,900
Keep him here.
I'm going in.

447
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,800
You're gonna let
the princess walk in there?

448
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,200
Don't let her go in there!

449
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,500
Three port prosperity
police officers

450
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,900
Who are listed in stable condition.

451
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,000
Wait.
Is that michelle benjamin?

452
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,400
Yes, we are seeing
princess michelle

453
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Making her way to the front
of the stronghold.

454
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,900
Until just a few moments ago,

455
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,900
It seemed like the police were
gearing up for some sort of--

456
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
You're not gonna
believe this.

457
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,400
Ethan shepherd.

458
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,000
Does this mean silas
is cancelling the handover?

459
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,700
No.

460
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,800
He's not gonna change his mind.

461
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,300
Then what are you doing here?

462
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,100
I came to apologize.

463
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,700
The king shouldn't have given up
your land without consulting you.

464
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,400
That's what you're offering?

465
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,300
An apology?

466
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,300
And a deal.

467
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,200
Lay down your guns and
i go out to the press

468
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,200
And announce that the king
has granted you all amnesty.

469
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,600
You can go back to your lives.
Your families.

470
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,700
This uprising forgiven in full.

471
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,500
So he doesn't even
know you're here.

472
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,600
??If i speak for him,
for you,

473
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,100
He has no choice but
to honor it.

474
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,000
You think we're gonna quit
when we've come this far?

475
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,900
It's that or prison.

476
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,500
Either way what you're doing here
is gonna 'cause your families

477
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,600
more suffering than a handover
of land every could.

478
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,900
I think we could do
a lot better than that.

479
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,100
- What are you doing?
-  Forcing the king's hand.

480
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,900
- This isn't the plan.
- We can settle everything today.

481
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Let's see silas ignore us now.

482
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,100
Bring in the king's own!
Storm 'em!

483
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
Kill everyone inside!

484
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,100
- She gets out safe.
- She will.

485
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,300
Media blackout. No impediments.
- Already done.

486
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,100
Only unn refuses to comply.

487
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,200
We got baker at the helm.
Call him, tell him to pull 'em out.

488
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,000
It's not baker anymore, sir.

489
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,200
Jack?

490
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,600
Call katrina ghent.

491
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,700
???Out.

492
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,100
Secure the perimeter.

493
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,600
??? We're the only network To
defy the king's blackout order.

494
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,700
- We're getting pressure.
- Dear god.

495
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,400
Not pressure.

496
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,400
My father sent his own daughter
in harm's way to be his mascot.

497
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,900
If he's ordering a media blackout
Then she already failed

498
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,700
And he doesn't want
anyone knowing it.

499
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,200
I say we broadcast
some embarrassment.

500
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,900
I say we don't.

501
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,500
Kill the live feed.

502
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,500
Go to black or find the weather.
We're off the port.

503
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,700
Excuse me. Why is anyone
listening to her?

504
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,700
Because they just got
the message i own the place.

505
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,800
Crossgen owns the network.

506
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,100
It did. I just bought up
the whole mess of shares.

507
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,000
My lawyers told me it's called an
"angry takeover," Something like that.

508
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,400
What do i know?

509
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,900
You must've really
pissed off your dad.

510
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,100
He had katrina ghent buy it out from
under us. He's that scared of transparency.

511
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,600
Or of you having
any real power.

512
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,200
He'd rather appoint that whore
than let you assert yourself.

513
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,000
You wanted my answer.

514
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,600
You have it.

515
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,600
No doubts.
I'm in.

516
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,400
Deep as you need me.

517
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,100
A pawn lost.

518
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,100
But we have our king.

519
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,100
He's no good to us
without samuels.

520
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,500
Without his blessing, The public will
never support a coup against silas.

521
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,600
Samuels will come.

522
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,500
A truly unprecedented and historic
move by the royal family at prosperity

523
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,300
With michelle benjamin stunning local
officials by meeting with protestors,

524
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,000
Now called rebels by some.

525
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,400
We now have word and can confirm

526
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,100
that the situation is resolved.

527
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,300
A peaceful resolution.

528
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,800
Who's in command here?

529
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,200
I am.

530
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,300
Sir, you should know not all the protestors
inside meant to risk her life.

531
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,300
His brother's one of the rebels.
He means to defend him.

532
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,200
One shepherd leaves
my flock.

533
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,900
The other leads them astray.

534
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,700
Yes, he took radical action to force
your hand, but he would never hurt her.

535
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,200
Others would.

536
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,600
She's there.

537
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,300
When she was chipped, i prayed
never to have to use it.

538
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,700
She's surrounded by
my best marksmen.

539
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,700
When i give the order,

540
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,000
just like flipping the switch,

541
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,000
Evveryone in there
save michell goes dark.

542
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,100
They don't deserve this.

543
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,700
My daughter's in
there at gunpoint.

544
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,600
I don't care if the whole world dies
as long as she comes out safe.

545
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,300
My family has given up
so much for you.

546
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,200
Please don't take ethan from us.

547
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,800
Let me go in there.
I can talk to them.

548
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I can try to get them
to give themselves up.

549
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,400
This is the safest
and best plan,

550
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,900
The only way to secure her safety.

551
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,700
Give me a chance.

552
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,600
Why should i trust
my daughter's life to chance?

553
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,100
When everything inside me

554
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,000
screamed I was
betraying my family,

555
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
I still trusted you.

556
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,700
You have two minutes,
but know this.

557
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,600
Once in there, we cannot
distinguish you from other.

558
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,800
And in two minutes' time
if you're still in there

559
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,000
And standing you die
with the others.

560
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,000
You coddle him.
This is no time for it.

561
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,100
We should proceed
with the original plan.

562
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,700
Enough.

563
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,000
It's over.

564
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,600
The press is gone.

565
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,400
Everyone is...

566
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,100
Except men with guns.

567
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,800
Put down yours.

568
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,000
While you still have a chance.

569
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,300
But our cause is right.

570
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,200
We can't surrender.

571
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,500
Martyring yourselves
won't change anything.

572
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,000
No one will even know.

573
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,600
God will.

574
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,800
God will know.

575
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,000
GET OUT. NOW.

576
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,100
Excuse me.

577
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,300
What about mom, huh?

578
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,800
What about our family?

579
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,000
I'm doing this for them.

580
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,500
You're not doing this for them.

581
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,100
Or god.
You're doing this for you.

582
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,400
What do you know?
You left us!

583
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
You couldn't stand that
i actually did something

584
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,400
- While you did nothing.
- I took care of mom!

585
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,100
Mom won't survive if
she loses another son!

586
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,500
You think this honors eli?
You're nothing like him.

587
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,800
Thank god he's dead.

588
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,600
Because if he could see you
He'd be ashamed.

589
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,800
Now.

590
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,700
You can stop worrying.
I'm fine.

591
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,200
Oh, good.

592
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,900
Now i can have you killed.

593
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,800
I should kill your serviceman too.

594
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,500
He answers to me, not you.

595
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,100
Not ever. That was the deal.

596
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,300
Do anything that stupid again
and all deals are off,

597
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,700
Save the one i made
with your jailor.

598
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,300
- You had me chipped?
- When you were five.

599
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,900
Your words today at the river.

600
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,100
Sir.

601
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,800
More than i ever heard you
string together in a month.

602
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,200
Now you've been in my employ
in this capacity for how long?

603
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,000
- I don't keep count.
- How long?

604
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:19,200
Ten years, eight months,
some days.

605
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Maybe it's time
for a promotion.

606
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,000
Klotz, where can
i find shepherd?

607
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,500
Already sent for him
waiting on the king, ma'am.

608
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,100
Oh, my god. You love
thomasina. Since when?

609
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,300
First night. Hair up.
Something happened.

610
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,500
- You are so screwed.
- Oh, i'm so screwed.

611
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,600
Let me explain.

612
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,100
You picked the wrong time
to stretch your wings.

613
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,800
I didn't know michelle was at risk
When i told the cameras to stay.

614
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,200
- I didn't know.
- And if you did?

615
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,300
I might've done the same.

616
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,300
You should be careful
accepting gifts from your uncle.

617
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,700
They're never actually gifts.

618
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,600
You push me to prove myself
Then cut me down when i aspire.

619
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,200
It doesn't exactly encourage.

620
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,700
No, i haven't been
fair to you, have i?

621
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,000
Some ministry positions
have recently opened

622
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,400
And i'm thinking of offering
one To someone in name only.

623
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,200
Maybe you should
have the job of it.

624
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,100
- You're giving me a ministry?
- The teeth behind the title.

625
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,600
Teach you to exercise
power without credit.

626
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,500
That's if you're still
interested in the position.

627
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,100
I am.

628
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,300
I think you two will
enjoy working together.

629
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,700
I don't know
where they took him.

630
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,400
There's no record of ethan
at any of the jails.

631
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,600
It's like they made him disappear.

632
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,300
I didn't know we did that.

633
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,700
I'm so sorry.

634
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,800
What you did...

635
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,200
Trying to save a princess
who doesn't know her place...

636
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,200
You don't have a place.

637
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,400
He's lucky to have
someone as loyal as you.

638
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,600
Captain.

639
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,200
The king awaits.

640
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,500
Show him, abner.
He's earned the right.

641
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,900
You were watching ethan
before the rally?

642
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,800
Your brother and his accomplices
Have been conspiring for weeks.

643
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,300
You knew what
they were gonna do.

644
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,300
That there was gonna be an uprising
And you let this happen?

645
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,100
A lone messenger sent out
to face an angry mob.

646
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,900
An inadequate response
to make me look deaf and dumb

647
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,200
And all the while fishing
as the crisis played on.

648
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,000
- To see who took the bait.
- Draw out the enemies.

649
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,200
You never wanted me to succeed.

650
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,500
The people have the right
To mock, scorn, criticize,

651
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,100
and burn Unflattering photographs
in effigy until morning.

652
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:37,500
But i will not have my country Drawn
back into war by opportunists or fanatics.

653
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,100
- What's gonna happen to my brother?
- He committed treason.

654
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,600
He saved michelle.

655
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Which is why he's
alive to stand trial.

656
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,200
I cannot brook insurrection.

657
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,800
But on your pledge that he
will return to face trial...

658
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,400
I'll release him
into your custody.

659
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,900
Sir.

660
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,600
I don't know why you think
he deserves special treatment.

661
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,800
Only concern yourself
with that i do.

662
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,700
The reverend samuels and william
Absent from our catch?

663
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,500
I'd have thought them first
in the bucket.

664
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,800
We have no evidence against them.

665
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,800
Should some be manufactured?

666
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,500
Their day will come.

667
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,100
Why did you warn me it was a trap?

668
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,400
Because silas has grown soft.

669
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,900
And is no longer the man
i swore to follow.

670
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,400
Ethan.

671
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,300
Ethan.

672
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,100
Don't talk to me anymore, david.

673
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,400
Don't talk to any of us.
