1
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,827
There you are.

2
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,659
Go now!

3
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,650
GIRLS GIRLS

4
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,073
Are you going to Traunstein?

5
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,121
No, farther, to Bergen.

6
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,548
Quite a drag, huh?

7
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,132
Why don't you get off
at the next station

8
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,430
and take the bus to Neumarkt?

9
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,100
You'll get to Bergen one hour earlier.

10
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,143
Good idea.

11
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,232
Bye.

12
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,986
Bye.

13
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,905
Where's the bus to Bergen leaving?

14
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,280
Back there,
but not until half an hour.

15
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,500
- What, no sooner than that?
- Yes, unfortunately.

16
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,229
Hello, are you going
in this direction?

17
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,354
Yeah, hop on.
Give me that.

18
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,577
Where are you headed?

19
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,671
To my parents, in Bergen.

20
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,086
- To Bergen?
- I meant to go there by bus,

21
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,958
but it's leaving much later.

22
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,006
I'm not going to Bergen though.

23
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,675
Yes, I know.

24
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,716
- Did you visit your boyfriend?
- No.

25
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,510
I'm coming from the reformatory.

26
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,992
Watch it, you beast!

27
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,086
Here. A little tranquilizer.

28
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,678
Thanks.

29
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,115
I want to get off.

30
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,859
Stop it, I want to get off.

31
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,487
What's the matter? I bet one
of those guys is going to Bergen!

32
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,238
Stop!

33
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,229
Station.

34
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,571
Over there. One of them
will surely give you a lift.

35
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,236
Give it to me,
I know these parts.

36
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,569
Thanks a lot, too!

37
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,437
Hey!

38
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,549
You're Andrea, aren't you?

39
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,931
Wait up!
Where are you going?

40
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,183
I recognized you right away.

41
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,098
Won't you slow down a bit?
I need to talk to you.

42
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,314
I'm Junior.

43
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,693
I know that.
Where is he?

44
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,820
Who?

45
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,940
He hasn't returned yet?

46
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,154
He left a little later.

47
00:08:56,161 --> 00:09:00,030
- When is he coming back?
- I don't know. In a couple of days.

48
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,283
- Is that why you're here?
- I'm not here.

49
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,754
Come with me.

50
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,754
Don't you want to know
how he's doing?

51
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,471
Are you coming?

52
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,106
I don't think we can talk here.

53
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,234
Would you mind if we went up
to the house?

54
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,577
- We can leave that here.
- I don't know.

55
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,789
Actually, I meant to go to Bergen.

56
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,284
Are you longing so badly for Bergen?

57
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,606
You surely don't want somebody
to see you, right?

58
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,352
- I don't care.
- Come.

59
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,821
A young sow is standing
in front of a socket.

60
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,157
It grunts and says:

61
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,367
Come on out, you chicken!

62
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,289
Look who I brought along.

63
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,502
Very proper.

64
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,223
It's beautiful here, isn't it?

65
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,189
- So, what about him?
- Did you come because of him?

66
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,814
I was discharged today.
Got a lift on a silo truck.

67
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,282
- After all, I couldn't know...
- You want to start this all over?

68
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,197
- Are you nuts?
- Besides...

69
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,071
You can report him once again.
Sorry.

70
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,618
I completely forgot that you're not
dependent anymore.

71
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,333
Leave me alone.
I had nothing to do with it.

72
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,953
- My parents did...
- Did they sleep with him, or did you?

73
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,081
You must've told them.
And since you had to tell them

74
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,209
you could've also stopped them
from running to the police right away.

75
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:20,085
I couldn't have known.

76
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,133
- If he hadn't been so arrogant...
- Come on!

77
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,097
You just wanted to profit.

78
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,932
They would've liked him
as son-in-law, huh?

79
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,053
- That's not true.
- You're nothing but a slut.

80
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,850
You're lying.

81
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,269
You know you're lying.

82
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,992
Don't make such a fuss.
I'm sorry.

83
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,907
- Are you?
- Junior!

84
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,826
Junior! Lunch's ready!

85
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,542
Anna, lay the table for two.

86
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,132
How do you do?

87
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,069
She seems to like you.

88
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,483
- She's always been jealous.
- Nonsense!

89
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:29,740
"Buchental, Schlamoni,"
"Degerndorf, Taurick."

90
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,264
Sit here.

91
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,849
Or am I taking your seat?

92
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,205
I liked him very much.

93
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,673
And now?

94
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,499
Do you still love him?

95
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,794
A lot happened since then.

96
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,682
It's been a long time.

97
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,560
I don't mean to say that
I've got something against him.

98
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:12,151
Besides, I hardly think

99
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,824
that he wants to see me again.

100
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,870
I don't think he...

101
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,379
I believe

102
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,673
it's over.

103
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,545
They were jealous.

104
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,219
He would take me on Sundays.

105
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,935
- To parties or the theater.
- Is that a crime?

106
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,231
He gave me presents.

107
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,975
A watch.

108
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:31,067
Then they noticed.

109
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,657
They shook me down
until I admitted it.

110
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,781
You wanted to take him in.

111
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,619
That's not true.

112
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,666
I even told the judge
that it had been my fault.

113
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,910
- That I wanted it.
- But you didn't mind the fact

114
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,208
- that he was nearly your father's age.
- No.

115
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,504
Well, he's not that old after all.
Sometimes you could mistake us for brothers.

116
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,753
- He used to say so, too.
- Say, didn't your parents pick you up?

117
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,345
No.

118
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,257
Hey, fancy that:

119
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:02,011
My mother visited me just once
in those 17 months.

120
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,893
- Mean, isn't it?
- Listen, I need to go to the factory.

121
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,731
Will you wait for me?
I'll be right back.

122
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,522
You can go to my cabin,
up by the pit. I'll meet you there.

123
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,863
You'll wait, won't you?
I'll make it quick.

124
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,030
I won't go up there.

125
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,891
I'm sorry.
It took a little longer.

126
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,235
Ever since he left, I had to
run the company all by myself,

127
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,900
without knowing much about it, really.

128
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,570
I thought you were waiting
for me at the house?

129
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,620
I used to come up here more often,
in my holidays.

130
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,583
I can't stand Switzerland.

131
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:38,592
I could've seen you, but he didn't
want me to go to the factory.

132
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,853
I sometimes watched you from the window.

133
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,999
Once, you crashed his sports car
against the rain barrel.

134
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,462
You were terrified,
but he just laughed.

135
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,002
What did you do in the garage?

136
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,760
I simply felt like sitting in a posh car.

137
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,173
- Come.
- I can get up by myself.

138
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,887
Come on, I'm in a hurry.

139
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,433
They need me before they call it a day.

140
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,946
- So, what about the garage?
- Oh, nothing.

141
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,078
Do you know that I was never allowed
to go inside when you were there?

142
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,622
That pissed you off, didn't it?

143
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,465
Wait! Catch me!

144
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,054
Did you hurt yourself?

145
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,897
No.

146
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,067
- Come on, I need to hurry.
- Just a moment.

147
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,561
Soon we won't find anyone in the office.

148
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,284
Say, can you ask them if someone
is going to Bergen?

149
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,926
Anything else, Schiller?

150
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,587
No. Just the detonation tomorrow, Junior.

151
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,260
Alright.

152
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,694
- Hey, you said you'd ask!
- Just a moment.

153
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,108
Have a good trip, Schorsch!

154
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,734
Okay!

155
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,577
Well then?

156
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,572
Don't you want to stay for the night?

157
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:18,202
<i>Marble, stone and iron break,
but our Io ve will not.</i>

158
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,461
Your parents won't know
that you were coming today.

159
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,547
Besides, it's already late.

160
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:26,676
You'll have trouble finding someone
who'll take you to Bergen today.

161
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,137
You can sleep in mother's room.

162
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,305
No, that won't work.

163
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,301
Your parents will be aware of the fact
that you've been discharged in the morning.

164
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,304
They'll wonder where you've been all day.

165
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,689
I'll think of something.

166
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:44,857
You'll definitely be better off
if you come home in the morning.

167
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,063
I don't know.

168
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:51,235
<i>... but our Io ve will not.</i>

169
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,409
I can't stay for the night like that.

170
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,931
Checkmate.

171
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,733
You could win once in a while,
don't you think?

172
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,650
I've had enough.
I'm going to bed now.

173
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,045
Wait a second.

174
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,680
What about the kiss?

175
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,607
Alright, tomorrow at breakfast then.

176
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,865
It's nice that you've stayed.

177
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,242
- Good night.
- Shall I switch on your light?

178
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,166
- I know my way. Sleep well.
- Thanks, you too.

179
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,915
I could give you a lift home in my car.

180
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,507
But I guess you prefer not to come home
before lunchtime tomorrow, right?

181
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,004
Yes.

182
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,052
I think so, too.

183
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,387
See you tomorrow.

184
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,453
Everybody ready?
Go!

185
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:46,180
We took out quite a bit too much,
didn't we?

186
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,185
We still need to blast away
that head up there.

187
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,100
- Hey, you takin' shelter with me?
- Hands off me, grandpa.

188
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,818
Leave her!
Go back to your digger.

189
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,168
Hey!

190
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,280
- So, did you sleep well?
- Yes.

191
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,320
Have there ever been accidents
when you had an explosion?

192
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,570
No, I don't think so.
Are you afraid?

193
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,464
Shall I tell you something?

194
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,307
Is it funny?

195
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,384
It happened a couple
of weeks ago.

196
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,183
Next to that stone over there.

197
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,273
I was carving a stick.

198
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,268
Suddenly, I feel spied upon.
I turn around

199
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,442
- and there's a man behind me.
- Goodness gracious!

200
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,867
Your hand is so warm.

201
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,662
At first, I wanted to run away.

202
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,537
But since he didn't move,
I walked up to him.

203
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:28,085
Look, over there.

204
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:31,213
Come on, whoever gets in the
sunlight first!

205
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,270
I've won!

206
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,323
You're pretty.

207
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,588
How about now?

208
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,723
You've got pretty eyes.

209
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,227
He had the same eyes.

210
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,776
When I came closer, I noticed
that he wasn't wearing any shoes.

211
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,911
Was it too hot for him?

212
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,750
I like your hair.

213
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:55,471
What eyes he had!

214
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:59,426
Suddenly, I realized:
he's not standing, he's hanging!

215
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,354
Even your nose is beautiful.

216
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,444
Who was that man?

217
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,027
Don't!

218
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,572
Who he was?

219
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,908
A pest exterminator.

220
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,622
Very funny.

221
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:44,346
Why... did he hang himself?

222
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,063
Because...

223
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,479
Because all of those bugs had gone

224
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,603
over his head.

225
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,097
What if somebody comes?

226
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,405
In America, they cover them in gold.

227
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,703
Do they feel the pain?

228
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,331
They die at once.

229
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:08,252
What will you do
when he comes back?

230
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,598
He isn't back yet.

231
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,307
- I'm scared.
- You're telling me?

232
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:20,139
You're going away,
but I'm his son.

233
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,891
See that furnace there?

234
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,732
We built it, while father was gone.

235
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,022
Yeah, it's great.

236
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,903
She really had the nerve
to come back.

237
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,075
Her?

238
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,540
She dares to do plenty of
other things, too.

239
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,125
Is that so?

240
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:25,246
Sometimes I'd like to know
what you're doing over there,

241
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,168
in that house.

242
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:31,210
Hey!
Gone mad, old buck?

243
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,100
Don't get all worked up,
you hypocritical bitch!

244
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,814
I supervised the installation
and construction myself.

245
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,933
It's not finished yet.

246
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,326
Watch out!

247
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,744
If you fall down there
you're minced meat.

248
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,506
Anything left to do for today?

249
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,175
No, not today.

250
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,642
- Look!
- I'll show you something.

251
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,397
Gosh, the warden!

252
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,063
I thought she was calling
only after three days?

253
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,812
"My dear..."

254
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:17,066
"how did you like the three days
with your family?"

255
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,574
You know what?

256
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,655
I'll stay.

257
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,704
Awful!

258
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:21,448
Aren't you ashamed to lie
in bed with a stranger?

259
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,443
And you, with your father's girlfriend!

260
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,578
I don't find that funny at all.

261
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,578
Oh, you!

262
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,998
How could you be so shameless,
with someone so much older than you!

263
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:39,049
All I know is that you've slept
with somebody, who's twice your age!

264
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,884
And who knows with whom else.

265
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:48,092
Can't you say something?

266
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,809
You're a whore.

267
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:37,933
Are you buzzing off?

268
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:40,027
Beat it, but quickly!

269
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:58,246
400 sacks to Nuremberg and
50 to Neumarkt. Hurry up!

270
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:04,423
Else, try to get the driver of the
Stucka mine. He has to go to Zirndorf.

271
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,796
- Alright, see you later.
- And tell Mr. Schiller to see me.

272
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:09,799
Did you get your trailer fixed, Schorsch?

273
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:12,301
- Yeah, right there.
- Well, what're you waiting for?

274
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:18,231
Drive off, we hardly manage anyway,
and do it pronto, will you?

275
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:21,147
- This delivery is very important for us.
- Telephone!

276
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,488
Yes. What's up?

277
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:36,241
What?!
Else, where's the commission book?

278
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:38,164
Yes. Yes.

279
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,044
Yes.

280
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,509
Yes, that will be fine.

281
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:52,174
Alright, don't detonate yet,
I'm coming up.

282
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,141
And get that pump!

283
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,364
- You called for me. Something happened?
- I'll be back at once!

284
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,570
The car is in use right now.

285
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:11,193
Never mind!

286
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,954
- Has something happened?
- What do I know?

287
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,567
Don't you move.

288
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:35,281
Excuse me, can you tell me
how to find the Kopernikus Road?

289
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,995
Yes, of course I know.

290
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,864
Well, how do you get there?

291
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,834
Drive up over there,
around the memorial,

292
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:45,705
over the old bridge
and then onto the main road.

293
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,171
Thank you.

294
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,306
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you all day.

295
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,304
- You don't say.
- I need to talk to you.

296
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:29,024
- Your parents are out anyway.
- Do you always have to force me?

297
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,517
Please.

298
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,190
All right.

299
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,068
But not here.

300
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:32,245
Try to understand.
It won't work with us.

301
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:35,499
- Why not?
- I'll have to go home eventually.

302
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,421
- Hey, boss!
- I'd driven you home

303
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,420
if you'd wanted me to.

304
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,463
Another letter!

305
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,089
Come on, let's go.

306
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,528
And besides,

307
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,568
what about Ernst?

308
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:04,278
Damn it, I can't stand that "Ernst"!

309
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:08,373
All right, "your father".
Drive me home.

310
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,881
Let's go to Munich.
I'll change on the way.

311
00:53:15,693 --> 00:53:18,527
"She's never been faster than today."

312
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,501
Hey, how are you doing?

313
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:42,626
Thanks!
New chick?

314
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,149
- Are you still mad at me for this morning?
- Never mind.

315
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:51,619
- Hey, you! Tommy's giving a party.
- Hi, Flo.

316
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,955
- Are you coming?
- I might, later.

317
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,040
Bring her with you!

318
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:47,727
She wouldn't be bad for a night, right?

319
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,105
- Yeah! She's nice, isn't she?
- Why don't you try her?

320
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,152
- Loser!
- Loser or not,

321
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,697
you'll always get it if you got
a fat sports car.

322
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:56,490
- Or a factory.
- Or something like that.

323
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,237
If that's his only way to make
an impression...

324
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,740
He'd even run off with your girlfriend.

325
00:57:00,751 --> 00:57:02,788
What? Mine?

326
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:05,875
- Don't make me laugh!
- You'll see.

327
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:08,294
All the females in the office
are after him.

328
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,462
That's where he snacked
on that girl, too.

329
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,927
Now they're snacking on him.

330
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:19,221
And he... will be next.

331
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,139
Leave the boy alone!

332
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,097
I'm glad to have him around.

333
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:29,902
Morning, guys. What's up?
May I join in on the joke?

334
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:32,568
- Can I talk to you for a moment?
- Sure.

335
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,746
Do you actually know
who that girl is?

336
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:47,461
- Why?
- Well, I just thought...

337
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,706
Leave the thinking to me!

338
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,974
Well Schiller, I'll be off.
Else has my number in Hanover.

339
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:04,096
- Call me if anything happens.
- Very well, Mr. Ledebur.

- I was looking for something.

351
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:14,918
Well? Did you find it?

352
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,848
One morning, she was gone.

353
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:31,720
She took her suitcase

354
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:34,730
and walked down the street.

355
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,768
I've never saw her again.

356
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:41,855
Later, we put her things
into boxes

357
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,699
and then a delivery truck came
and picked up all the stuff.

358
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:48,153
Why did she run off?

359
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:52,160
Country life proved too dull for mylady.

360
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,493
He was traveling all the time

361
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:57,996
and left her alone by herself.

362
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,467
He looked like Junior back then.

363
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:13,140
How long have you been here, Anna?

364
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,936
Nearly eleven years.

365
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,404
I was 23 when I started here.

366
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:28,238
Back then, they kept the big house.

367
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:31,195
One cook, one domestic servant

368
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:33,198
and two maids.

369
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,825
When she left,
they were all sacked.

370
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,622
And you?

371
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,412
Me?

372
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:45,339
I lived alone with him, here.

373
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:49,972
Junior had been sent
to a boarding school.

374
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:52,467
Wasn't there too much work?

375
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,058
For two people?

376
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:04,233
Back then, I didn't look so bad.

377
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:07,190
You should've seen me.

378
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:10,488
When I went to the factory,

379
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:13,029
they dropped their work.

380
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:16,456
Oh well.

381
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:19,459
In any case, I didn't do badly.

382
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:21,249
See?

383
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,589
That's no business of mine.

384
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,893
Looking for your boyfriend?
He's in the woods.

385
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,610
What are you doing?

386
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,605
Want to have a look?

387
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:02,036
Getting a kick out of this, huh?

388
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:22,561
- I thought you were at the factory?
- As you see, I'm here. What do you want?

389
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,063
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

390
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:26,686
Tell me,

391
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,653
did Anna ever have a thing
with your father?

392
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:31,569
- Nonsense!
- I don't know.

393
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:34,284
With Ernst, I wouldn't be surprised.

394
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,279
Ernst, Ernst, Ernst! Dammit,
how many times have I told you

395
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,406
that I don't want you to call him
Ernst all the time?!

396
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:41,409
Say, why are you in such a bad mood, hm?

397
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,207
Because of the workers.

398
01:04:58,186 --> 01:05:01,145
Just what I needed.
They just pull off their usual show.

399
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,480
- Shall we go?
- Come on.

400
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:05,395
I don't feel like it.

401
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:08,561
Take me with you!

402
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:12,106
Junior, are you there? Come out,
we want to ask you something!

403
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:17,077
Beloved Anna, where has that
famous Junior hidden?

404
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,447
Probably at the factory.
Come on in!

405
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:22,291
- If that ain't an offer!
- Let's go inside!

406
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,746
Junior has a new girlfriend!

407
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,499
- You don't say. Whose are you?
- Nobody's.

408
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,501
You don't need to wait.

409
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:35,130
- His girlfriend is much more beautiful.
- What does she look like?

410
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,507
She's got big green eyes!

411
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:40,635
- Do you know where they are?
- In a castle up in the woods.

412
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,261
Can you do me a favor?

413
01:05:42,272 --> 01:05:45,060
Go there and tell them
that we are here, will you?

414
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,934
How stupid,
you sound like a child.

415
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,570
There they are!

416
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:54,573
Let's go after them!

417
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:56,700
Come on!

418
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,003
- Come on, this way!
- Yeah.

419
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:17,968
They are up there!

420
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:22,225
Go, go!

421
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:38,317
Come on!

422
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:43,785
We'll get you in the end!

423
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:49,578
Hurry up!

424
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,416
Go, go!

425
01:07:57,657 --> 01:07:59,239
Hey!

426
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:04,695
Come on.

427
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:28,302
Hey!

428
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:34,563
- Come on in.
- No!

429
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:36,561
It's really warm.

430
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:39,526
Shall I?

431
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:09,828
Jump, frog!

432
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:53,159
Look at yourselves!

433
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,964
- Where are the others?
- They wanted to get booze

434
01:11:09,974 --> 01:11:12,011
but I think they got stuck.

435
01:11:12,018 --> 01:11:13,600
Come.

436
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:27,739
What are you doing here?

437
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:32,073
Is that all you can say?

438
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:34,954
So it's true after all.

439
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:37,415
- What's true?
- About your new girlfriend.

440
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:39,743
Don't do that.

441
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,176
Love?

442
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:54,175
Wait for me downstairs.

443
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:18,749
Are you coming to the Schlosscafé, too?

444
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,078
- Wait, I'll be right down.
- Okay, but hurry up.

445
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,681
Are you ready yet?

446
01:12:46,654 --> 01:12:48,441
Who was that?

447
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:16,299
- Bang!
- Are you coming?

448
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:51,250
- Listen, can you do me a favor?
- Sure, Junior.

449
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,092
Fetch the blonde and
take her with you, all right?

450
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:56,088
Okay, she gets cleaned and buried.
Who's the other one?

451
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:59,432
- A gift from heaven.
- Oh yes, from daddy.

452
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:02,970
- Well then.
- Are you coming?

453
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,518
Why ask him?
Ask her.

454
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,982
Come here.

455
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:12,946
Siggi, Willi, Richard, Joe,
and that's the lovely Monika.

456
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:16,108
I think we'd better leave.

457
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:18,280
- I think so, too.
- What about you?

458
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:20,779
What did I say? Love!

459
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:24,079
- Who's giving me a ride?
- Come on, let's beat it.

460
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:26,501
I'll stop by again,

461
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:28,712
before the holidays are over.

462
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:31,001
- Are you going back to Lausanne?
- Hey, take me with you!

463
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:33,216
They got a great club over there.

464
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:38,714
Hey, what about me?
Don't leave me!

465
01:14:43,771 --> 01:14:45,433
Are you going back to Lausanne?

466
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:47,931
- Why don't you come with me?
- What do I do there?

467
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:49,934
Listen, I'll talk to...

468
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:51,731
No, that won't work.

469
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:55,197
I can study in Munich. You could
come visit me every Sunday.

470
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,657
- What were you going to say?
- Just an idiotic idea.

471
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,902
I definitely won't go back
to Lausanne.

472
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:02,204
- What's your old man doing?
- Why?

473
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:05,370
He's fighting for his pension.
War injury, but they don't accept it.

474
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:07,584
So that's where he got to
practice with the law.

475
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,794
Paragraph 174 isn't so well known.

476
01:15:09,797 --> 01:15:11,914
I thought we agreed
to skip this topic.

477
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:13,916
It's an interesting topic.

478
01:15:13,926 --> 01:15:16,509
The police talked him into
using that paragraph.

479
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,550
All right, your father
is completely innocent.

480
01:15:34,113 --> 01:15:36,150
You're not at the factory?

481
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:39,404
It's funny, watching you in your sleep.

482
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,493
You've got no idea
how ugly you are!

483
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,742
That's unfair.

484
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,203
Watch me, you look like this:

485
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:54,919
Besides, you talk in your sleep.

486
01:15:55,176 --> 01:15:57,293
- You're lying!
- So, what about Johanna?

487
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:58,885
You're lying!

488
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,505
If you don't admit at once
that you're lying,

489
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:04,098
- I'll kill you!
- "Late night edition!"

490
01:16:04,101 --> 01:16:05,933
"Vice scandal at cement factory!"

491
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:08,269
"Lover strangles son and takes
father to jail!"

492
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:11,765
- As you wish! So you suffocate!
- Push harder!

493
01:16:19,283 --> 01:16:22,367
Look here.
You need to go back home today.

494
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:25,453
If your parents are suspicious,
I'll talk to them.

495
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:28,073
- What's the matter?
- Dad may come back any moment.

496
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:31,293
- Something has to happen.
- Won't he send a telegram first?

497
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:33,457
Sure, and he might not
come back today.

498
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:36,582
But as soon as he's here,
I'll talk to him. About us, I mean.

499
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:40,256
- If you want, you can work here again.
- I don't want to work here anymore.

500
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:43,930
Even the caretaker's little daughter
knows about us.

501
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:46,141
All that stupid gossip.

502
01:16:46,143 --> 01:16:47,725
I neither want to live
with my parents.

503
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:50,186
Be honest, you're just afraid
that father and you will reconcile.

504
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:51,771
Nonsense!

505
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:53,731
Don't be childish.

506
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:55,984
You think he's coming back,
and everything goes on,

507
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:58,319
as if nothing happened?

508
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:01,527
You think running away helps?

509
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:03,696
All right, I'll drive you home.

510
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:06,911
When he's here, I'll talk to him.
We'll sort everything out.

511
01:17:07,206 --> 01:17:10,119
Okay.
You're discharged.

512
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,037
Hey.

513
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:13,910
Come here.

514
01:17:13,921 --> 01:17:15,958
I need to tell you something.

515
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:22,552
Now, go to the factory.

516
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:29,972
Well, Anna?
What are your workers doing?

517
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:31,561
Oh, you!

518
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:44,361
Come, come!

519
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:50,580
- It's not my fault! I didn't do anything.
- It's never your fault.

520
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,415
- I'm fed up with this!
- Stupid excuses.

521
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:55,456
Hi Junior. We'll tear open the hill now.
You should come over.

522
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:57,795
Sorry about yesterday, Schiller.
I've been an idiot.

523
01:17:57,798 --> 01:18:00,131
- I'm the one who's sorry.
- Let's forget about it. Any news?

524
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:02,126
Yes. The general manager's
left for Hanover.

525
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:04,173
The trade fair, I know.

526
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:08,056
Pammer, do me a favor:
Leave Anna alone, will you?

527
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:12,182
- What did he say?
- That he will shut you up.

528
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:13,724
Shut me up?

529
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:17,099
He'd better watch for his girl,
so that I won't make it with her!

530
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:19,560
- What's the matter?
- Oh, that horny dame!

531
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:21,812
Horny dame? Who? Anna?

532
01:18:21,822 --> 01:18:25,941
She used to complain to the senior,
and now, it's the boy who's bothering me.

533
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:27,818
Charming!

534
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:39,545
Hello Anna.

535
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:42,586
You look so dressed.

536
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:44,630
You'll be rid of me soon.

537
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:48,297
- Well, bon voyage then.
- Need a hand?

538
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,260
No!

539
01:18:50,809 --> 01:18:52,425
As you want.

540
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:55,804
Oh, Anna?

541
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:58,599
I'll stay for lunch though.

542
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:03,441
Well, if we cut up here,
it won't fit anymore.

543
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:23,210
How much is it?

544
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:25,504
About fifty marks.

545
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,220
Keep the change.

546
01:19:29,223 --> 01:19:30,680
Thanks.

547
01:19:34,937 --> 01:19:37,645
The old man's back.
Go down and tell Schiller.

548
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:06,083
Listen, the old man's back.

549
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:08,593
The old man's back.

550
01:20:10,055 --> 01:20:12,138
Hey, the Senior has returned.

551
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:15,470
Have you heard?
The boss is back.

552
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,719
Hey chubby, the old man's back.

553
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:22,520
Hey you, your supreme boss is back.

554
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:31,779
- Girls, he's back!
- And just in time, too.

555
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,547
Cheers.

556
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:48,587
- Thanks.
- Cheers.

557
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:56,466
Just a moment.

558
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:01,933
Hey!

559
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:06,942
Bring a crate of beer!

560
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:09,528
- I'm paying for the round.
- Okay, Junior.

561
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:13,950
Is it your birthday?

562
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,219
Thanks.

563
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:37,056
There you go. Cheers!

564
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:45,056
It's a nice day, isn't it?

565
01:21:45,275 --> 01:21:46,686
Cheers!

566
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:49,644
Cheers!

567
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,362
To your health!

568
01:21:58,205 --> 01:22:02,165
Come with me.
I need to tell you something.

569
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:06,916
- The old man's back.
- What?

570
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:12,671
So, you cryin' already?

571
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:15,045
Your boss is back.

572
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:54,585
Look, over there!

573
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:03,305
- Hey!
- Hey!

574
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:32,747
Higher!

575
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,064
Thank you, Fritz!

576
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:02,906
Good bye!

577
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:55,914
Hey!

578
01:24:59,636 --> 01:25:02,595
What are you doing here?
What are you here for?

579
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:05,465
How did you know
I'd get discharged today?

580
01:25:05,475 --> 01:25:06,932
You...

581
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:10,724
I'm awfully happy to see you.
Come inside.

582
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:14,144
I'm glad.

583
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:18,270
You look sweet.
Have you seen my boy?

584
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,942
Where's he at?

585
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:22,694
Huh?

586
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:21,841
Well?

587
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:25,344
Come, sit over here.

588
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:36,438
Wine?

589
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:51,033
Junior!

590
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:55,037
Well, how are you?

591
01:26:55,585 --> 01:26:57,451
- Are you happy that I'm back?
- Yes...

592
01:26:57,462 --> 01:26:59,203
Have a seat first.

593
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,331
You're still panting.

594
01:27:04,803 --> 01:27:06,385
There.

595
01:27:06,388 --> 01:27:07,924
Drink.

596
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:33,329
Thanks.

597
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:39,961
- Well, how do you like her?
- You know, I...

598
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:41,704
Don't you like her?

599
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:45,207
Well, bon appétit!

600
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:48,093
Mmh, it's excellent.

601
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:51,256
That's something you have to
renounce every day in prison.

602
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,808
Not to speak of other things.

603
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,894
Well, finally one of you two
opens their mouth.

604
01:27:56,897 --> 01:27:58,729
This isn't a funeral, is it?

605
01:27:58,732 --> 01:28:00,689
When did you arrive?

606
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:04,401
An hour ago. I meant to call you first,
so you can pick me up,

607
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:07,147
but I just took a cab instead.

608
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,712
Why don't you say something?

609
01:28:47,781 --> 01:28:51,525
That smells good. I would've preferred
to take you with me as my cook.

610
01:28:51,785 --> 01:28:54,243
By the way, even inside,
I still made some money.

611
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:58,035
74 marks 30.
I spent half of it on the cab though.

612
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:11,965
- Is the new cauldron finished?
- Not yet.

613
01:29:11,972 --> 01:29:14,009
In about two weeks.

614
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:16,800
We'll go up there later, huh?

615
01:29:23,942 --> 01:29:25,934
Isn't he great?

616
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:28,648
He managed the factory all by himself.

617
01:29:28,655 --> 01:29:31,193
Don't exaggerate.
Ledebur did most of the work.

618
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:34,909
Nothing against Ledebur, but without you,
it wouldn't have worked.

619
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:39,118
But that's over now.
You'll go straight back to university.

620
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:45,627
Say...

621
01:29:46,464 --> 01:29:48,626
I've reconsidered.
About Lausanne, I mean.

622
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:51,842
Don't worry.
We'll talk about that later.

623
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:57,849
And you?
What are you doing?

624
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:00,684
Do you want to work for us again?

625
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:02,144
No.

626
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:08,852
I'll talk to your parents.

627
01:30:09,487 --> 01:30:11,820
I've got some talking to do
with them anyway.

628
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:16,116
Junior will have to excuse us after lunch.

629
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:18,202
We can talk about it then.

630
01:30:18,455 --> 01:30:20,538
And later, you and me
will go to the factory.

631
01:30:29,215 --> 01:30:31,423
You haven't changed at all.

632
01:30:33,595 --> 01:30:35,427
Where are you going?

633
01:30:37,557 --> 01:30:39,640
Well, I can do it later.

634
01:30:42,646 --> 01:30:44,478
Come on, let's go.

635
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:48,599
Come on.

636
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:52,444
And tonight, we'll have a little
game of chess, right?

637
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:47,370
Junior, have you seen Sabine?

638
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:49,414
- Is she with you?
- No.

639
01:31:49,421 --> 01:31:51,754
There were some lumberjacks.
I don't trust those fellas.

640
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:53,213
- Come off it!
- If you see her,

641
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:55,424
tell her to come home at once!

642
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:45,571
Who is it?

643
01:33:45,954 --> 01:33:49,322
It's me. I need to get something
from the desk.

644
01:33:49,332 --> 01:33:52,075
- Does it have to be now?
- I'm sorry.

645
01:34:06,224 --> 01:34:07,806
There you are!

646
01:34:08,101 --> 01:34:10,218
I've been looking for you all over.

647
01:34:16,568 --> 01:34:18,025
Let's go over.

648
01:34:18,278 --> 01:34:21,862
I'm coming after you right away,
there's just something I forgot.

649
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:52,847
Did you tell him?

650
01:34:55,398 --> 01:34:58,357
- I'll tell him then!
- Stay here!

651
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:01,227
I'll be back right away.
I'll give you a lift home then.

652
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:38,097
I must talk to you.

653
01:35:38,524 --> 01:35:41,107
Right now?
Can't we do that later, in peace?

654
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:43,022
No, now!
It's very important.

655
01:35:43,029 --> 01:35:44,986
Alright, is something with your car?

656
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:47,231
- No, I...
- Greetings, Mister baron!

657
01:35:47,242 --> 01:35:49,609
Schiller! How's it going?

658
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:51,576
How are the wife and children,
is everything fine?

659
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:53,992
Yes, thank you.
The girl's going to high school now.

660
01:35:53,998 --> 01:35:56,786
- Did you find her?
- I'll give her a big goodie-bag.

661
01:35:56,793 --> 01:35:59,706
- After all, I'm her godfather.
- Thanks, that won't be necessary.

662
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:01,954
- She was in the woods.
- Schiller, go to the office

663
01:36:01,965 --> 01:36:04,252
and get the books ready.
I want to check them later.

664
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:06,421
Yes. Right away.

665
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:09,963
He's acting as if we still lived
under the emperor.

666
01:36:16,145 --> 01:36:18,387
- Hello, Otto!
- Hello!

667
01:36:19,107 --> 01:36:20,723
Let me see.

668
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,061
Well done.

669
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:31,734
- Cheers!
- Back on the track, boss?

670
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:33,906
Go on laughing.
You'd rather like it.

671
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:35,745
If he knew.

672
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:39,075
- Hello!
- This is Schorsch, our new driver.

673
01:36:39,085 --> 01:36:41,372
Hello.
I hope you like it with us.

674
01:36:41,379 --> 01:36:43,416
I do, thanks.

675
01:36:55,184 --> 01:36:57,517
- Good day everybody!
- Hello.

676
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:00,726
I didn't memorize you this pretty.

677
01:37:00,982 --> 01:37:02,848
Did you dye your hair?

678
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:06,060
Hi there.
Nice decoration.

679
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:07,944
Who's using...

680
01:37:07,947 --> 01:37:10,360
It smells like Cabochard.

681
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:12,695
Hello, brown-eye.

682
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:15,152
Well, where's Ledebur?

683
01:37:15,163 --> 01:37:17,155
He's in Hanover, at the exhibition.

684
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:20,245
At the exhibition?

685
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:23,877
Very well.

686
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:35,180
Hello, Paul.
Is everything working out?

687
01:37:37,769 --> 01:37:39,635
Listen a second, will you?

688
01:37:39,645 --> 01:37:43,309
Come, let's go over there,
nobody will disturb us there.

689
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:52,818
Come.

690
01:37:53,534 --> 01:37:55,491
You see?
That's why I'm wearing a helmet.

691
01:38:12,512 --> 01:38:14,549
You know, Dad...

692
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:22,435
I see you've been making
nice progress with the building.

693
01:38:43,668 --> 01:38:45,751
So, what were you going to tell me?

694
01:38:47,797 --> 01:38:49,208
Watch out!

695
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:52,583
Quite deep.

696
01:38:55,263 --> 01:38:57,550
Why haven't you fixed this yet?

697
01:39:01,602 --> 01:39:03,559
So, what were you going to tell me?

698
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:08,815
It wasn't easy,
building the kettle.

699
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:12,399
You've done very well.
I'm proud of you.

700
01:39:27,253 --> 01:39:30,917
Oh, one thing I meant to tell you:
I'd like to study in Munich.

701
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:33,081
All of a sudden?
Don't you like Lausanne anymore?

702
01:39:33,092 --> 01:39:34,958
- I do, but...
- Then why the change?

703
01:39:34,969 --> 01:39:38,303
- Well, I just thought...
- I'd like to check the books first.

704
01:39:45,938 --> 01:39:48,271
- Well, kids, you know...
- Watch out!

705
01:39:48,774 --> 01:39:51,391
Alright, my beauties,
show me the cashier books.

706
01:39:51,402 --> 01:39:53,610
Let's see how badly you cheated.

707
01:39:53,613 --> 01:39:56,606
I'm keeping the book now.
Didn't Junior tell you?

708
01:39:56,616 --> 01:39:58,357
Give it to me.

709
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:02,574
Junior? He's got something
entirely else on his mind.

710
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:04,071
Why?

711
01:40:04,457 --> 01:40:06,540
What do you mean?

712
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:08,826
Huh?

713
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:12,747
Come on!
Spill the beans.

714
01:40:28,523 --> 01:40:30,765
- She's gone.
- Gone?

715
01:40:31,234 --> 01:40:32,770
Where?

716
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:35,440
- With her suitcase.
- With her suitcase?

717
01:40:54,799 --> 01:40:56,961
Anna, will you make us
roast hare tonight?

718
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:59,130
I'm sure Ernst will be delighted.

719
01:40:59,345 --> 01:41:02,713
Where am I supposed
to get a hare at this hour?

720
01:41:53,065 --> 01:41:55,933
- How'd you like pork leg tonight?
- I hope there's enough left.

721
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:58,105
- Where's the boy?
- It'll be enough for you two.

722
01:41:58,112 --> 01:42:00,104
- Why two?
- She's gone.

723
01:42:00,114 --> 01:42:02,356
- Gone?
- Yes.

724
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:04,574
Half an hour ago.

725
01:42:11,959 --> 01:42:13,791
Would you like pork leg for tonight?

726
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:15,251
Great.

727
01:42:15,254 --> 01:42:18,088
- And a game of chess afterwards?
- Why not?

728
01:42:19,842 --> 01:42:22,676
Maybe we should accept the offer
from Habelburger Zement after all.

729
01:42:22,678 --> 01:42:24,294
What do you think?
