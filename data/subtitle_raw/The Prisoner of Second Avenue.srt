1
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,504
<i>This is Roger Kelting</i>
<i>with the 9:00 report.</i>

2
00:00:26,676 --> 00:00:29,076
<i>The heat wave rolls on</i>
<i>as the city swelters...</i>

3
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:33,341
<i>... through its eighth consecutive day</i>
<i>of record temperatures in the upper 90s.</i>

4
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:35,916
<i>The temperature in Central Park</i>
<i>at 9 a. M...</i>

5
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:39,681
<i>... is 96 degrees with no relief in sight.</i>

6
00:00:39,856 --> 00:00:42,017
<i>More power blackouts in the city today.</i>

7
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:45,093
<i>And residents in sections of Queens,</i>
<i>Jackson Heights...</i>

8
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:49,061
<i>... and the Morrisania section of the Bronx</i>
<i>and Bedford area of Brooklyn...</i>

9
00:00:49,232 --> 00:00:53,999
<i>... have been without any lights</i>
<i>or electricity for 18 hours.</i>

10
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,579
Wait a minute. Wait!

11
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,291
- Exact change only.
- Well, I'm sorry.

12
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:23,455
- I didn't wake up with exact change today.
- Off, mister. Let people through.

13
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:26,534
- Am I supposed to be born with 35 cents...?
- Off! Off!

14
00:01:26,703 --> 00:01:28,466
Oh, for crying...

15
00:01:44,587 --> 00:01:46,316
Joe.

16
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:48,252
Joe!

17
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:08,477
Forty-seventh and Madison.

18
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:12,513
Forty... Forty-seventh and Madison!

19
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:18,610
- Got any air conditioning up there?
- What?

20
00:02:18,788 --> 00:02:22,485
- Air conditioning!
- Yeah. It's on. Isn't it great?

21
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:24,991
It's great up there.
Back here it's a coffin.

22
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:35,797
- Here. Keep 35 cents for yourself.
- Hey, what?

23
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:39,264
Keep 35 cents for yourself!

24
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:41,130
- It's locked.
- What's the matter?

25
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,898
It's jammed. Open this thing!
I can't breathe...

26
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:46,803
- Stop kicking. You'll break my cab!
- Well, open...

27
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,501
You're very nervous with the kicking
and banging.

28
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:53,080
I ain't picking you up again.
I don't like nervous people.

29
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:55,683
They make me nervous!

30
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:19,334
- Hey, Mel.
- Hey, Charlie.

31
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,636
- No complaints. How's Edna?
- Who?

32
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:24,541
- Edna.
- Edna? Oh, fine.

33
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:27,376
- The girls?
- The girls are fine, I guess.

34
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,711
- They're up at school.
- Are you all right?

35
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:32,116
You look like you haven't slept
in a week.

36
00:04:32,288 --> 00:04:36,054
- I don't sleep in this weather.
- Hear things are rough in the office.

37
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:38,591
- Rough. You know, lousy.
- What do you...?

38
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:41,025
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, it's just the season.

39
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,598
- Things'll get better.
- I hope so.

40
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:48,937
- Wasn't that your floor?
- No. I'm 16.

41
00:04:49,105 --> 00:04:51,573
- That was 16.
- Oh, God, I must be dreaming.

42
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:55,802
I'm lucky I'm in the right building.
I'll get off on this next one. See you.

43
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,109
- What's wrong with the doors?
- We're stuck.

44
00:04:59,282 --> 00:05:00,874
- What?
- It happened yesterday.

45
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,450
- They overload the power.
- We're trapped?

46
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:07,385
- They know we're here. They'll get it going.
- We should holler for help.

47
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,993
- Press the alarm button.
- Would you press the alarm button?

48
00:05:11,627 --> 00:05:15,791
- I don't think it's working.
- I told you. We should yell for help. Help!

49
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:17,865
Help! Damn it! Help!

50
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:20,502
Help. Help.

51
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,663
Hel...!

52
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:27,139
See you, Mel.

53
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,497
Helen.

54
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,931
- There's no water.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

55
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,336
Didn't get to fill it.
I was typing letters for Mr. Brockman.

56
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:02,740
- What's wrong with his secretary?
- She was laid off yesterday.

57
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:05,938
I'm doubling between you
and Mr. Brockman. That all right?

58
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,710
- Sure. If you think you can handle it.
- I can handle it, all right.

59
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:14,122
There really hasn't been that much to do
here lately, has there?

60
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,960
I put some vouchers on your desk to sign.

61
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:24,397
- For what?
- Sandwich you sent out for yesterday.

62
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:27,468
From now on, no food can be charged
to the company.

63
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:31,095
- It was an egg salad and Coke, wasn't it?
- Yeah, and a big pickle.

64
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:33,071
- I put down the pickle.
- Good.

65
00:06:33,242 --> 00:06:37,702
Because I don't want to cause any concern
at the annual stockholders' meeting.

66
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,835
Oh, God.

67
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,372
God, God, God.

68
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,841
- Mel?
- What?

69
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,242
- Can't you sleep?
- If I could sleep...

70
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:15,282
...would I be here calling God
at 2:00 in the morning?

71
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:18,318
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Nothing.

72
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:20,786
Something's the matter, Mel.

73
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:23,892
It's 12 degrees in here.
Middle of a goddamn heat wave.

74
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,427
- It's 12 degrees in here.
- Turn the air conditioner off.

75
00:07:27,597 --> 00:07:31,328
Then how do we breathe?
84 degrees outside. It's 12 degrees inside.

76
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:34,470
- Either way, they're gonna get me.
- Want another blanket?

77
00:07:34,637 --> 00:07:37,299
- I ain't got another.
- I called the superintendent.

78
00:07:37,473 --> 00:07:40,636
He said he'd be up to fix it tomorrow.

79
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:45,180
Why do they bother printing "high, medium
and low"? Everything is high.

80
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:47,816
Low is high, medium is high.

81
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:52,183
One night they'll put it on high
and need a flamethrower to get us out.

82
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:54,949
- What do you want me to do?
- Go back to sleep.

83
00:07:55,158 --> 00:07:59,993
- I can't sleep when you're tense like this.
- I'm not tense. I'm frozen stiff.

84
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:05,363
- Are you sure there's nothing else?
- There's nothing else.

85
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:08,026
Go to sleep, Edna.

86
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,307
Oh, God.

87
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:17,708
Do you mind if I tell you something?

88
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,976
You were tense when you walked in
the house. You've been tense for a week.

89
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:24,642
I've seen you when you get this way.
What is it?

90
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,311
It's nothing. I'm tired.

91
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,859
- I'm up, Mel. You might as well tell me.
- Well, I'm telling you it's nothing!

92
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:38,998
I don't know. It's everything.
It's this apartment.

93
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:41,033
This building. It's this city.

94
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:42,933
It's this... Now, listen.

95
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:45,334
Come listen to this.
Two in the morning.

96
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:49,239
One car's driving around
in Jackson Heights. We can hear it.

97
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:52,375
Fourteen stories up, subway's louder
than in the subway.

98
00:08:52,548 --> 00:08:57,281
We're like some kind of an antenna.
Sounds come up here, then out to the city.

99
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:01,514
- For six years, it never bothered you.
- It's worse now. I don't know why.

100
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:05,957
I'm getting older, more sensitive
to sounds and...

101
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:10,797
Two in the morning.
You believe it's still going on next door?

102
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,265
- What's going on?
- You trying to be funny?

103
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:17,873
- You don't hear that? You must be deaf.
- I must be deaf. I don't hear a thing.

104
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,339
"The beat, beat, beat of the tom-tom
as the jungle shadows fall"?

105
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,002
Or, "the tick-tick-tock of the stately clock
against the wall"?

106
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:28,548
- You don't hear that?
- Not when you're talking or singing...

107
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:31,744
...I don't.
- It's those two German airline hostesses.

108
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:35,687
Every night they got somebody else.
Hockey players, basketball...

109
00:09:35,858 --> 00:09:37,155
Whatever team's in town.

110
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,920
Win or lose, nobody loses
when they wind up there.

111
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:43,190
Every goddamn...
Somewhere there's a 747 flying around.

112
00:09:43,366 --> 00:09:47,200
Everybody's serving themselves.
Those broads never leave the apartment.

113
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,597
Holy... Come here.
Come here.

114
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:54,140
- Tell me you can't hear that.
- Yes. Now I hear it.

115
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,039
Is it any wonder I can't sleep?

116
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:58,908
Don't sleep next to the wall.
Sleep in the bedroom.

117
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:03,250
Will you knock it off in there!
It is 2-damn-o'clock in the morning!

118
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:07,886
I cracked the wall!
I barely touched it and I cracked the wall.

119
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:11,117
Lucky I wasn't hanging a picture.
We could've been killed.

120
00:10:11,294 --> 00:10:14,559
It was starting to crack before.
They're fixing it Monday.

121
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,665
Not Monday. No.
I want that fixed tomorrow.

122
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,266
- Understand?
- I'll tell them.

123
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:23,269
Mention the air conditioner. And
the window that only opens if it rains.

124
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:25,566
Then it won't shut till there's a flood.

125
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:29,939
- And the toilet that's constantly flushing.
- It stops flushing if you jiggle it.

126
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:33,548
Why should I have to jiggle it?
With the money I'm paying here...

127
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,651
...do I have to jiggle every time
I go to the bathroom?

128
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:39,219
When you're through, tell me.
I'll jiggle it.

129
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:43,287
You go to bed. I don't want to talk
about jiggling anymore.

130
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:45,393
Do you hear me?
Please go to sleep.

131
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:49,122
I can't when I know you're walking around
having an anxiety attack!

132
00:10:49,298 --> 00:10:51,664
I'm not having an anxiety attack.

133
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:55,099
I'm just a little tense.

134
00:10:56,372 --> 00:10:58,340
Oh, God.

135
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:07,675
- Why don't you take a Valium?
- I took one.

136
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,614
- Take another one.
- I did. They don't work anymore.

137
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:14,654
- Two Valiums have to work.
- Tell them. Mine didn't read the instructions.

138
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:20,185
Oh, don't you ever fly anywhere?
Go keep someone in Europe awake!

139
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:22,695
Stop. You're really
making me nervous now.

140
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:27,063
What is wrong? You don't look good.
You look pale. You look...

141
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:31,362
- Why are you rubbing your stomach?
- I'm not rubbing it. I'm holding it.

142
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,440
- Why are you holding it?
- I don't know!

143
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,100
Indigestion probably,
that crap I had for lunch.

144
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:38,746
- Where did you eat?
- Health food restaurant.

145
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:41,906
If you can't eat health food,
what can you eat?

146
00:11:42,184 --> 00:11:45,711
I'll make you a nice cup of tea.
I could use one myself.

147
00:11:47,356 --> 00:11:49,586
Nothing is safe anymore.

148
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:52,652
I read two white mice
at Columbia University...

149
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:56,423
...got diabetes from eating graham crackers.
It was in <i>The New York Times.</i>

150
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:58,362
That what's bothering you?

151
00:11:58,534 --> 00:12:00,525
Did you eat graham crackers today?

152
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,131
Food used to be so good.

153
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,605
I used to love food.
I haven't eaten food since I was 13.

154
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:11,042
Tomorrow I'll make you real food.
I remember how they made it.

155
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:14,307
I haven't had a real piece of bread
for 30 years.

156
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:18,010
If I'd known that, I'd have saved
some rolls when I was a kid.

157
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:20,417
I just can't breathe in here.

158
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,828
Christ, what a stink!

159
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,990
What the...?

160
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,434
Look at that. Fourteen stories,
you can smell the garbage.

161
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:40,268
Why do they put garbage out
in 84-degree heat?

162
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,510
Edna, you want to smell the garbage?

163
00:12:43,746 --> 00:12:46,146
- I smell it.
- You can't smell it from there.

164
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:48,112
Come here where you can smell it.

165
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:56,991
- That a ripper?
- You're right.

166
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,393
If you really want to smell it,
you have to stand right here.

167
00:13:01,564 --> 00:13:05,500
Whole country's being buried by garbage,
keeps piling up higher and higher.

168
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:09,126
- In three years, this will be the second floor.
- What can they do?

169
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:12,103
Save it for winter?
They gotta throw it out sometime.

170
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:14,708
That's why they call it garbage.

171
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,805
I can't talk to you.
I can't talk to you anymore!

172
00:13:18,981 --> 00:13:20,710
I'm a human being, same as you.

173
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,477
I get cold, hot. I smell garbage,
I hear noise.

174
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:26,143
You either live with it or you get out.

175
00:13:26,522 --> 00:13:30,390
If you're a human being, you reserve
the right to complain, to protest.

176
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,720
Give up that right, you cease to exist!

177
00:13:33,195 --> 00:13:36,392
I protest against stinking garbage
and jiggling toilets!

178
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,966
And barking dogs! Now, shut up!
Damn it.

179
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:43,666
If you're gonna yell at the dog,
I'm gonna go to sleep.

180
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,841
How are you gonna sleep
with a dog screaming like that?

181
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:51,242
Keep that dog quiet down there.
There's human beings sleeping!

182
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,246
- Christ almighty.
- Shut up, down there!

183
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,385
- We got children up here!
- Why are you yelling at me?

184
00:13:57,553 --> 00:14:02,217
- Want to complain? Keep the dog company.
- Just keep it quiet.

185
00:14:02,558 --> 00:14:05,789
- Will you stop it, for God's sake?
- Stop telling me to stop it!

186
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:07,553
Now, don't tell me to stop it!

187
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:11,865
I don't know what's gotten into you,
but don't take it out on me.

188
00:14:12,034 --> 00:14:16,767
If it's too much, take a room at the library!
Don't take it out on me. I'm going to sleep.

189
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:18,834
Edna.

190
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:23,272
Don't go.

191
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:28,415
Talk to me.

192
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:32,344
For a few minutes.

193
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,982
I think I'm losing my mind.

194
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:44,231
What is it, Mel?

195
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:48,467
I'm unraveling.
I'm losing touch.

196
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:51,399
Something is happening to me.
I'm losing control.

197
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:54,566
I can't handle anything. L...

198
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:59,506
I forgot how to work the water cooler.

199
00:14:59,682 --> 00:15:04,381
I stood there with an empty cup
and water running all over my shoes.

200
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,288
It's not just you.
It's everybody.

201
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:13,587
- Everybody's feeling tensions these days.
- Oh, tension.

202
00:15:13,762 --> 00:15:17,220
God, if I could feel tension.
When you're tense, you're tight.

203
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,163
You're holding something.
I don't know where to grab.

204
00:15:21,103 --> 00:15:24,561
I'm slipping. I'm scared.

205
00:15:25,274 --> 00:15:27,504
Don't talk like that.

206
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:32,503
- Now, what about seeing the analyst again?
- Dr. Pake? He's dead.

207
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,706
Six years of my life and $23,000.

208
00:15:34,883 --> 00:15:37,579
What does he care if he gets
a heart attack?

209
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:40,278
There are other good doctors.
See someone else.

210
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:45,621
What's the use? God, I don't know
where I am or who I am.

211
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:48,122
I'm disappearing, Edna.

212
00:15:48,297 --> 00:15:50,731
I don't need an analyst.
I need lost and found.

213
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:56,365
- Who could that be?
- What?

214
00:15:57,272 --> 00:15:59,001
I'll get it.

215
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:04,838
Hello. Yes, this...

216
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:08,381
Yeah, this is apartment 14A,
and what about it?

217
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:11,513
What? I'm keeping you awake?

218
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:15,555
Who the hell do you think got me up
to get you up in the first place?

219
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:19,592
What? Don't tell me you've got a plane
to Stuttgart in the morning.

220
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:24,028
I'll talk as loud as I want!
This isn't some kind of sublet, you know.

221
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:26,861
I'm a regular, American, paying tenant!

222
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:28,298
Think l...

223
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,166
You bang on the wall,
you'll get a bang right back.

224
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,309
- If she bangs, bang back.
- What are you starting it for?

225
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:37,172
- Will you... Bang back.
- It's 2:30. Leave them alone.

226
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:39,507
- They'll go to sleep.
- Will you bang back?

227
00:16:39,682 --> 00:16:43,209
- If I bang, they'll only bang back at me!
- Will you bang back?

228
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:46,013
I'll bang. I'll bang.

229
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:47,519
All right?

230
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,317
Bang back.

231
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:51,391
Bang back.

232
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,560
Bang back!

233
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:56,394
Go on!

234
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:09,668
- Hi, Helen, any calls for me?
- No, Mr. Edison. No calls.

235
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,637
What's wrong?

236
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,949
- Mr. Brockman was fired this morning.
- Jim Brockman? Jesus.

237
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,953
Mr. Durstan called him into his office
about an hour ago.

238
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,815
Guess you'll be sharing me
with Mr. Durstan now.

239
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:26,324
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

240
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:30,294
Yes, Mr. Durstan?

241
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,464
Yes. Right away. Yeah.

242
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:04,392
Mel?

243
00:18:07,302 --> 00:18:09,327
- Are you all right?
- What?

244
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,032
- What are you doing?
- Just thinking.

245
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:16,878
- About what?
- Nothing.

246
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:20,477
That's not possible. If you're thinking,
it's about something.

247
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:23,914
- Otherwise, you're just staring.
- I was just thinking.

248
00:18:24,787 --> 00:18:26,721
Why don't we relax this weekend?

249
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:29,449
Your brother Harry invited us
out to the country.

250
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,889
I'm not going.
Four-hour drive each way.

251
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,655
Another four hours listening
to how big his pool is.

252
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,856
A day away from this
might be wonderful for you.

253
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,366
- Fresh air...
- He'll give me breathing lessons.

254
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:45,029
Every time I go to the country,
Harry gives me breathing lessons.

255
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,641
I told him we'd come.

256
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,707
Then why ask me? Just say
we're going to Harry's on Sunday...

257
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,678
...to look at his pool
and learn how to breathe.

258
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:03,716
We're going to Harry's on Sunday to look
at his pool and learn how to breathe.

259
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:23,774
Christ, I forgot about those dogs.
They're killers.

260
00:19:23,946 --> 00:19:26,915
Oh, they're not.
They're sweet like their own kids.

261
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,050
I'm afraid of their kids too.

262
00:19:30,018 --> 00:19:32,543
- Hello.
- Here they are.

263
00:19:32,721 --> 00:19:38,023
- Hello! Hello!
- Welcome to the country, city folks.

264
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:40,661
- Hello. Hello.
- How are you?

265
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:42,797
- Harry. Harry!
- Hello, Harry.

266
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:44,398
Oh, Harry!

267
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:48,659
Be careful.
There's some poison ivy around here.

268
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:51,362
- Why are we walking here?
- Because it's beautiful.

269
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:56,136
This is all my property we're walking on.
These are my bushes, my trees, my earth.

270
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:59,246
- These your mosquitoes?
- Gnats. They're not mosquitoes.

271
00:19:59,414 --> 00:20:01,314
- Gnats?
- We don't have mosquitoes.

272
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:04,816
I'm glad they're just gnats.
They don't bother you, huh?

273
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:07,455
They don't bother me,
I don't bother them.

274
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,490
- They bother people from the city.
- Is that poison ivy?

275
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:12,388
- Where?
- Right there.

276
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:16,190
No, no, no. That's weeds.
That's just weeds.

277
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:18,265
Where you're standing is poison ivy.

278
00:20:24,573 --> 00:20:27,940
Organic. This is all organic.

279
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,908
You don't get organic vegetables
in the city, do you?

280
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:35,743
I don't know what it is. I boil it, we eat it,
I throw the paper away and we feel rotten.

281
00:20:35,918 --> 00:20:38,978
Well, of course.
I'm gonna teach you to grow vegetables.

282
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,054
You can do it on your terrace.

283
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:43,783
Now, first thing you have to learn...

284
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:46,860
...is to get yourself into the soil.

285
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:50,897
Come on, now.
Just get right into the soil.

286
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:54,092
It's wonderful.

287
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:57,033
- Feel like a little swim, Mel, huh?
- Maybe later.

288
00:20:57,205 --> 00:21:01,141
Maybe later, a little swim.
How big you think that pool is, Mel?

289
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,870
- Go on. Take a guess.
- You told me last time.

290
00:21:04,046 --> 00:21:06,276
It's 40 by 15.

291
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:09,984
Fifty by 15. I had it enlarged.

292
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:12,643
I could get 160 people in there.

293
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:14,679
You really want to, Harry?

294
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:18,585
You're upset about something.

295
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:23,259
You look pale, Mel, tired. You should have
come out here weeks ago.

296
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:26,959
- You okay, kid?
- Harry, I'm 48. I'm hardly a kid anymore.

297
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:32,004
I'm 55, and I feel like a kid.
I have ever since I moved out of the city.

298
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:34,836
Breathe that air in.
Fill your lungs.

299
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,844
- It'll stay with you a week.
- I'll do it before we go. It'll last longer.

300
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:43,974
I've got the lungs of a 25-year-old boy.
I've got the x-rays inside.

301
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,116
You want to see them?

302
00:21:46,955 --> 00:21:48,388
Maybe after lunch.

303
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:51,483
After lunch.

304
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:57,564
How long have I tried to get you
to move to the country?

305
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,360
Fresh air, low crime rate.

306
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:02,298
In two years,
we've had only four burglaries...

307
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:05,167
...two attempted rapes
and one completed rape.

308
00:22:05,474 --> 00:22:07,032
Give me the country anytime.

309
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:10,137
Don't lie there.
We just had manure put down.

310
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,985
Well, listen, tell me about the girls.
Do they like college?

311
00:22:22,157 --> 00:22:23,556
Karen seems very happy.

312
00:22:23,725 --> 00:22:26,523
Maggie, I don't know about.
She never writes.

313
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:28,992
Come on. Try it.

314
00:22:34,503 --> 00:22:36,095
Up and down.

315
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,762
Up and down, never sideways.

316
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,570
Never sideways.
Okay, I'll try to remember.

317
00:22:43,745 --> 00:22:46,714
What do you do with yourself
now that the girls are gone?

318
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:49,680
- It must be very lonely for you.
- It is sometimes.

319
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:51,978
I've thought about going back to work...

320
00:22:52,154 --> 00:22:55,180
...but I like to be home
when Mel gets there.

321
00:22:59,061 --> 00:23:02,030
Up and down.
Up and down, never sideways.

322
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:20,614
Can I ask you something personal?
After all, I'm your brother for 55 years.

323
00:23:20,782 --> 00:23:25,776
- Forty-eight. You had seven on your own.
- Fifty-five, 48, what's the difference?

324
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:30,523
I think something's wrong.
I think you got some kind of trouble.

325
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:33,227
I'm not blind.
You're not enjoying yourself.

326
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:37,297
I've been here three hours. I've got
poison ivy, I'm chewed up by gnats...

327
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:40,026
...I laid in manure
and your dog piddled on my car.

328
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:43,831
So I haven't really had a hell of a lot
of time for rural ecstasy.

329
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,268
I can tell by the way you put
that Scotch away.

330
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:50,434
- Something is very wrong.
- Nothing is...

331
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:53,308
I'd like to know
so that maybe I can help you.

332
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:56,349
What is it? Trouble with Edna?
Another woman?

333
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,043
Edna's the only damn thing
I can depend on.

334
00:23:59,221 --> 00:24:00,779
Then you got no troubles.

335
00:24:00,956 --> 00:24:04,153
You're happy with your wife,
got your health, got no trouble.

336
00:24:04,326 --> 00:24:06,226
I got fired, Harry.

337
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:11,621
All right. You got a problem,
but not trouble.

338
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:14,533
Good. For a minute there,
I was worried.

339
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:19,231
I'm not saying it's wonderful news, but
it's not the end of the world. Don't panic.

340
00:24:19,407 --> 00:24:22,968
When the littlest thing would happen,
you'd panic. Am I right?

341
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:26,706
Oh, you're right. Every time I lose a job
after 22 years, I panic.

342
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,510
You were 4 years old.
Look how you were crying.

343
00:24:29,684 --> 00:24:31,982
Look how you panicked.
Look how calm I am.

344
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:34,816
Look how you didn't have
to get on the damn pony.

345
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,322
I was on plenty of ponies in my time.

346
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:39,457
Bigger ponies than this.

347
00:24:39,628 --> 00:24:41,789
I was the breadwinner.
Don't forget that.

348
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:44,932
- I have never forgotten the bread.
- But I never panicked.

349
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,661
I always tried to examine the situation
intelligently.

350
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:52,034
You always fell apart.
You were that way in the crib.

351
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:53,674
- Remember that?
- Distinctly.

352
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:57,039
I remember panicking in the crib.
You sat in the highchair...

353
00:24:57,212 --> 00:24:58,907
...figured it out intelligently.

354
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,173
Why? What was the reason they gave?

355
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:04,841
- You worked there over 20 years.
- They lost $3 million last year...

356
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,046
...and 2 the year before.
They're looking to save pennies.

357
00:25:08,223 --> 00:25:12,284
The vice president of my department
used the same paper clip for six months.

358
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,325
Nobody came to work late anymore.

359
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,260
They were afraid somebody
would sell your desk.

360
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,798
In other words, you saw it coming.

361
00:25:19,968 --> 00:25:21,697
All right.

362
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,634
You know what you can do, don't you?
Come in with me.

363
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:28,866
Thank you, Harry. No offense,
I'm not cut out for the chandelier business.

364
00:25:29,477 --> 00:25:34,073
Lighting fixtures, not just chandeliers.
Lighting fixtures!

365
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,214
And don't knock it.

366
00:25:38,386 --> 00:25:42,254
Could we turn all of this off?
It looks like a night game at Shea Stadium.

367
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:58,639
And what did Edna say
when you told her?

368
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,436
- Nothing.
- Isn't that something? No tears, no panic.

369
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:05,444
I knew it.
She's got a lot of strength, that girl.

370
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:09,812
- I didn't tell her, Harry.
- Oh, my God, I wonder how she'll take it.

371
00:26:10,218 --> 00:26:13,676
Why do you think I slept two minutes
in six weeks? I keep waiting...

372
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:16,915
...for something to turn up.
- Tell her, Mel.

373
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:19,424
Tell her.
Don't bear this burden by yourself.

374
00:26:19,594 --> 00:26:21,721
It helps to share it with other people.

375
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:25,431
- I told you, and I don't feel any better.
- I'm not your wife.

376
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,899
This is something you have to share
with your wife.

377
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,231
What's something you share
with your wife?

378
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,635
Dinner.

379
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,578
How would you like your steaks?

380
00:26:37,946 --> 00:26:39,436
Medium.

381
00:26:40,315 --> 00:26:41,577
Medium.

382
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,347
Medium.

383
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:54,790
What were you talking about so long
with Harry?

384
00:26:55,096 --> 00:26:58,259
I don't know. I never listen
when I'm talking to Harry.

385
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:01,493
Talk to me, Mel.
I'm a good listener.

386
00:27:02,804 --> 00:27:06,365
- Edna.
- Yes, Mel?

387
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:09,676
Get a dollar for the toll.

388
00:27:20,088 --> 00:27:22,386
<i>This is Dan Raller</i>
<i>with news on the hour.</i>

389
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,651
<i>It's 5:00, and the temperature</i>
<i>is 92 degrees.</i>

390
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:30,287
<i>A member of the Albanian Diplomatic Corps</i>
<i>was mugged today in Central Park...</i>

391
00:27:30,465 --> 00:27:34,060
<i>... despite the fact that two patrolmen</i>
<i>were only 100 yards away.</i>

392
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,170
<i>The Albanian claimed he screamed loudly</i>
<i>for two minutes.</i>

393
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:41,639
<i>But unfortunately did not know</i>
<i>the English word for "help."</i>

394
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:46,037
Good afternoon.

395
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,046
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

396
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,062
Oh, my God.

397
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:07,431
Oh, my God.

398
00:28:07,836 --> 00:28:11,033
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

399
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:13,606
Oh, my God!

400
00:28:23,852 --> 00:28:28,949
385 East 88th Street, apartment 14A.
Corner of Second Avenue.

401
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,748
I don't know yet.
The television, some jewelry...

402
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:35,157
...liquor, clothing.
Lots of clothing.

403
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,265
All my dresses, my coats.

404
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:42,164
All of my husband's suits.
There's not a thing left in his closet.

405
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:46,434
Well, could you send somebody
right away?

406
00:28:46,608 --> 00:28:48,803
I'm all alone here.

407
00:28:49,544 --> 00:28:50,875
Thank you.

408
00:28:51,446 --> 00:28:53,175
Goodbye.

409
00:28:53,848 --> 00:28:57,284
Valium. I need a Valium.

410
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,162
Edna?

411
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:51,635
Mel, it's you.

412
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:54,006
Didn't Mildred come to clean today?

413
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:59,172
Not today. Mondays and Thursdays.

414
00:30:00,248 --> 00:30:04,014
Well, what the hell happened here?
Why is this place such a mess?

415
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,681
We've been robbed.

416
00:30:09,324 --> 00:30:10,655
What do you mean, robbed?

417
00:30:12,627 --> 00:30:15,460
Robbed. Robbed.

418
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,157
What does rob mean?
They come in, they take things out.

419
00:30:19,334 --> 00:30:21,928
They used to be yours,
now they're theirs.

420
00:30:22,103 --> 00:30:23,365
We've been robbed!

421
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:28,207
I don't understand.
Someone walked in and robbed us?

422
00:30:28,376 --> 00:30:31,675
You think they made an appointment?
We've been robbed!

423
00:30:31,846 --> 00:30:35,043
Calm down. Take it easy.
I'm asking one simple question.

424
00:30:35,216 --> 00:30:37,343
- What did they get?
- I don't know yet.

425
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:40,511
I was shopping.
I was only gone five minutes...

426
00:30:40,688 --> 00:30:43,156
You couldn't have been gone five minutes.
Look.

427
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:44,723
Five minutes. That's all.

428
00:30:44,893 --> 00:30:48,056
It took the Santini brothers two days
to move everything in.

429
00:30:48,229 --> 00:30:50,629
How could junkies move it out
in five minutes?

430
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:52,163
It's a special talent.

431
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:55,097
When you came back
did you notice anybody suspicious?

432
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,263
- Everyone in this building is suspicious.
- Did you notice anybody leaving...

433
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,466
...with bundles or packages?
- Three guys in the elevator.

434
00:31:02,644 --> 00:31:05,579
How should I know it was our television?

435
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:10,045
They took the television.
A brand-new color television.

436
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:14,314
- You saw them and didn't say anything?
- Should I have made a citizen's arrest?

437
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:17,515
I had bundles in my arms.
I didn't know it was ours!

438
00:31:17,692 --> 00:31:20,593
Could you describe them to the police?

439
00:31:20,762 --> 00:31:23,060
I didn't notice.
I'm not Bulldog Drummond.

440
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:26,962
- What do you want from me?
- Sit. I'll get you a Scotch. It'll calm you.

441
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:30,298
- It won't calm me down. They took it.
- My Chivas Regal too?

442
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:33,235
No, they're gonna take cheap Scotch,
not the Chivas.

443
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:35,569
They took it all.
They cleaned us out!

444
00:31:36,744 --> 00:31:40,077
Sons of bitches.
Sons of bitches.

445
00:31:41,215 --> 00:31:45,151
Sons of bitches!

446
00:31:45,787 --> 00:31:49,484
Dirty rotten bastards!

447
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:52,549
You heard me!

448
00:31:56,431 --> 00:32:00,299
Must've been gorillas to lift all that
in five minutes. Sons of bitches.

449
00:32:00,468 --> 00:32:03,960
- Stop swearing. I just called the police.
- Did you call the police?

450
00:32:04,138 --> 00:32:06,732
- Didn't I say that?
- Tell them we were robbed?

451
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:09,240
Why else would I call them?

452
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:13,073
- What kind of questions are you asking?
- Calm down. You're hysterical!

453
00:32:13,247 --> 00:32:14,976
- I am not.
- You're hysterical.

454
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:17,083
You're making me hysterical.

455
00:32:17,251 --> 00:32:19,481
Don't you realize my house
has been robbed?

456
00:32:19,654 --> 00:32:22,589
What am I, a boarder?
My house has just been robbed too.

457
00:32:22,757 --> 00:32:24,987
My Scotch, my television are missing too.

458
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:28,856
- You didn't walk in and find it.
- What is the difference who found it?

459
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,157
There's still nothing to drink or watch.

460
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:36,392
Oh, my God.

461
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:39,131
They found my kitchen money too.

462
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:40,934
What kitchen money?

463
00:32:41,109 --> 00:32:43,577
I kept my kitchen money in here.

464
00:32:43,745 --> 00:32:46,373
- Eighty-six dollars.
- In cash?

465
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:49,482
Why do you keep cash in the book?

466
00:32:49,651 --> 00:32:51,846
So no one will find it.

467
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,751
- Where else am I gonna keep it?
- Okay, it's all right. It's all right.

468
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:59,255
As long as you're all right.
As long as you weren't hurt.

469
00:33:01,095 --> 00:33:03,427
Imagine if I'd walked in
and found them, Mel.

470
00:33:03,598 --> 00:33:06,123
- What would I have done?
- You were very lucky.

471
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,996
- But what would I have done?
- What's the difference?

472
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:10,432
You didn't find them.

473
00:33:10,605 --> 00:33:12,869
But supposing I did.
What would I have done?

474
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:16,010
You'd say "Excuse me,"
close the door and come back later.

475
00:33:16,177 --> 00:33:19,669
What would you do, sit and watch?
Why do you ask me such questions?

476
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:22,372
Look. The lock isn't busted,
it isn't jimmied.

477
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,882
I can't figure out
how they even got in here.

478
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,245
Maybe they found my key in the street.

479
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:32,656
If you didn't have your key, how were
you gonna get back in the house?

480
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,895
I left the door op...

481
00:33:36,898 --> 00:33:38,695
You left the door open.

482
00:33:40,334 --> 00:33:43,394
Well, what was I supposed to do,
take the furniture with me?

483
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:45,937
I was only gone five minutes.

484
00:33:46,407 --> 00:33:49,001
How did they know I was
gonna leave the door open?

485
00:33:49,177 --> 00:33:51,270
They know.
A door opens, doesn't lock...

486
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,677
...the whole junkie world lights up:
"Door open, 14th floor...

487
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:56,942
...88th and Second Avenue." They know.

488
00:33:57,485 --> 00:34:00,079
I didn't think they'd try my door
while I was out.

489
00:34:00,254 --> 00:34:02,814
- I gambled, I lost.
- What kind of gamble is that?

490
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,323
You lose, they get everything.
You win, they rob somebody else.

491
00:34:06,494 --> 00:34:08,621
I had to shop. There was nothing to eat.

492
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,788
Now you got something to eat
and nothing to eat it with.

493
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:15,099
Why didn't you call up
and have them send it?

494
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:17,669
I shop in a cheap store
that doesn't deliver.

495
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,172
I've been trying to save us money
because you got me so worried.

496
00:34:21,342 --> 00:34:25,802
I saved us $ 1.79 with green stamps
and no delivery charge.

497
00:34:30,885 --> 00:34:34,218
- What are you doing?
- We can't leave it. I want to clean up.

498
00:34:34,388 --> 00:34:35,650
Now?

499
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:38,587
- It's a mess. People are coming.
- The police.

500
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,094
You're gonna clean for them? Afraid
they'll put down "bad housekeeper"?

501
00:34:43,264 --> 00:34:45,164
Leave it, maybe they'll find a clue.

502
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:47,195
- Where you going?
- In the bedroom.

503
00:34:47,401 --> 00:34:50,996
- I'm wringing wet and I'm gonna change.
- Don't change.

504
00:34:51,806 --> 00:34:53,899
You look fine to me.

505
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:56,768
Well, thank you. I'm still wringing wet.

506
00:35:07,388 --> 00:35:11,484
Where are my seven suits,
three sport coats and five pair of slacks?

507
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:15,026
That's what you had,
that's what they got.

508
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:19,030
- I'm lucky my tuxedo's in the cleaners.
- They sent it back this morning.

509
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,431
Boy, they did a good job!
Oh, they cleaned me out!

510
00:35:22,603 --> 00:35:27,165
They left me with a pair of khaki pants
and a golf cap! The dirty bastards!

511
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:32,505
Mel, it's just things.

512
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,478
Just some old coats and suits.
We can replace them.

513
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:41,146
- We'll buy new ones.
- With what? With what, Edna? They fi...

514
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:45,186
They fired me.

515
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:49,022
Oh, my God, don't tell me...

516
00:35:50,331 --> 00:35:53,266
Hell, I'm telling you. They fired me.

517
00:35:58,139 --> 00:35:59,572
Oh, Mel.

518
00:36:00,107 --> 00:36:01,938
I'm so sorry.

519
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,708
I'll be all right.

520
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:07,575
- Don't worry. I'll be all right.
- I know you will.

521
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,012
- I'll find another job.
- Of course you will.

522
00:36:10,184 --> 00:36:14,746
You'll take down the living room drapes,
make me a suit, and I'll look for another job.

523
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,954
We'll be all right. We will.

524
00:36:17,124 --> 00:36:19,684
It's not the end of the world.
We can move away.

525
00:36:19,861 --> 00:36:22,523
- We don't have to live here.
- Why should we move?

526
00:36:22,697 --> 00:36:26,292
I still have value. I still have worth!

527
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:28,725
I know.

528
00:36:28,903 --> 00:36:31,872
What kind of a life is this,
living like caged animals...

529
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:34,872
...in a Second Avenue zoo that's too cold
and too hot?

530
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:37,567
Overcharged for a growth
they call a terrace?

531
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:41,146
Is this a worthwhile life?
Banging on walls and jiggling toilets?

532
00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:43,306
Where the hell do you want to move to?

533
00:36:43,517 --> 00:36:46,418
Maine, Vermont, Oregon?

534
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:50,887
Unemployed lumberjacks are sawing legs
off chairs because they have nothing to do.

535
00:36:51,058 --> 00:36:54,892
Don't you understand, I'd go anywhere
with you so long as you were happy.

536
00:36:55,062 --> 00:36:59,294
We could move to Europe, Spain. Two
people can live on $ 1500 a year in Spain.

537
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,594
Spanish people!

538
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:06,738
I need a drink.
Let's go somewhere and get a drink.

539
00:37:06,908 --> 00:37:09,468
- There's beer in the fridge.
- They didn't look there?

540
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,102
That's good to know. We can keep
the clothes in there from now on.

541
00:37:20,021 --> 00:37:22,922
- Mr. Edison?
- Yeah. Come on in.

542
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,983
I'd offer you fellows a drink,
but I'm afraid you're a little late.

543
00:37:45,246 --> 00:37:46,770
Did you hear that detective?

544
00:37:46,948 --> 00:37:51,578
There was 346 robberies
in the city today, 346.

545
00:37:51,752 --> 00:37:55,449
That means they gotta solve 345
before I get my suede shoes back.

546
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:59,323
Maybe they will. They have
a description of everything we lost.

547
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:01,324
Terrific.

548
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:05,056
All I gotta do is find three guys
dressed the way I used to dress.

549
00:38:05,232 --> 00:38:06,961
The stuff is gone.

550
00:38:07,134 --> 00:38:10,865
It galls me that this winter, three junkies
will be warmer than me.

551
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:13,063
Come on. Let's get out of here.

552
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,875
Oh, sweetheart, it's so rotten.

553
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:30,854
To get fired and come home and find your
house has been robbed on the same day.

554
00:38:31,025 --> 00:38:34,756
I wasn't fired today.
That happened Thursday.

555
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,034
Bottle of Chivas Regal.

556
00:38:42,937 --> 00:38:44,268
- Last Thursday?
- Yeah.

557
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:47,134
You've known for four days
and haven't said a word?

558
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:50,300
I didn't know how.
I couldn't work up my courage.

559
00:38:50,478 --> 00:38:54,039
I was hoping a miracle would happen,
another job would come along.

560
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:56,445
Miracles don't happen when you're 48.

561
00:38:57,218 --> 00:39:02,781
When Moses saw the burning bush,
he was 23, 24 the most, never 48.

562
00:39:07,128 --> 00:39:12,532
- Hello? We're back.
- Mel, don't do that. You're scaring me.

563
00:39:58,345 --> 00:39:59,778
Dinner is served.

564
00:40:27,741 --> 00:40:29,800
Edna, we have to get out.

565
00:40:30,945 --> 00:40:33,880
- I'll go wherever you want.
- I don't mean out of here...

566
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:37,745
...out of obligations.
Things we don't need that are choking us.

567
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:41,217
I'm gonna quit the gym.
I don't need a gym for any $200 a year.

568
00:40:41,388 --> 00:40:43,151
I'll run around the bedroom.

569
00:40:43,324 --> 00:40:45,758
Only way to keep warm in there anyway.

570
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,325
And look at this.

571
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:53,266
$8.50 for a musical whiskey pourer.

572
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:54,831
Toys, novelties...

573
00:40:55,302 --> 00:40:57,031
...it's garbage. It's crap.

574
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,605
- Horseshit!
- No more. We'll never buy another thing.

575
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:03,808
Why did I give them 22 years of my life?
What for?

576
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:07,812
A musical whiskey pourer? It's my
life that's been poured down the drain.

577
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:11,247
Where's the music?
Where's a cute little tune?

578
00:41:11,418 --> 00:41:14,876
They kick you out after 22 years,
they ought to have a brass band.

579
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,216
Don't get upset.
You're gonna get sick.

580
00:41:17,591 --> 00:41:22,426
You know where my music is? There it is.
It's playing on the other side of that wall!

581
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:25,193
And it...

582
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:28,795
There's my music at the end of twen...

583
00:41:36,544 --> 00:41:38,068
What is it?

584
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,837
What's the matter?

585
00:41:40,014 --> 00:41:44,041
Pains in my chest. Don't worry,
it's nothing. It's not a heart attack.

586
00:41:44,218 --> 00:41:46,277
What do you mean?
Why do you say that?

587
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:48,648
It's not a heart attack,
it's chest pains.

588
00:41:48,822 --> 00:41:53,316
- Why you having pains in your chest?
- Because I don't have a job.

589
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,825
Because I don't have a suit.
Because I'm having a breakdown...

590
00:41:56,997 --> 00:41:59,295
...and they didn't leave me decent pajamas.

591
00:41:59,466 --> 00:42:01,525
Bastards. You bastards!

592
00:42:02,336 --> 00:42:05,999
- You dirty rotten bastards!
- Shut up, down there!

593
00:42:06,173 --> 00:42:09,631
- We got children up here.
- Don't yell at me. They took everything!

594
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,370
Left me with a damn pair of pants
and a golf hat.

595
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,913
There are children up here.
Are you drunk or something?

596
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:18,347
Drunk, drunk on what?
They took the liquor.

597
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:21,852
You worried about your children,
lock them in a closet.

598
00:42:22,022 --> 00:42:24,456
Don't you have any respect
for anybody else?

599
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,526
Respect? Yes, I've got respect.
For my ass!

600
00:42:27,861 --> 00:42:30,694
That's what I respect.
That's all anybody respects.

601
00:42:30,864 --> 00:42:32,456
Respect my ass!

602
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:51,474
Oh, my God, Mel.

603
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,142
Oh, my God.

604
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,189
That's a terrible thing to do.
That is a mean, terrible thing to do.

605
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,888
God will punish you for that.

606
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:09,399
I apologize for my husband's language,
but God will punish you for that!

607
00:43:10,771 --> 00:43:14,172
It's all right, Mel.
It's all right, baby.

608
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:17,674
Terrible thing to do to a person.
I wouldn't do that to anyone.

609
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:20,211
Never. You're too good.

610
00:43:20,381 --> 00:43:22,542
You're too decent.

611
00:43:22,983 --> 00:43:28,853
It's gonna be all right. I promise.
You'll find another job. You'll see.

612
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,828
You know what we could do, Mel?

613
00:43:34,995 --> 00:43:36,860
You're so good with kids.

614
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:40,432
I mean, you love being around them.
We could start a summer camp.

615
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:42,728
You could be the head, I would cook...

616
00:43:42,903 --> 00:43:46,600
...and the girls could
be the swimming and riding instructors.

617
00:43:46,774 --> 00:43:49,174
You'd like that, wouldn't you, Mel?

618
00:43:49,843 --> 00:43:53,904
All we have to do
is just save some money.

619
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:56,549
Even if you don't get
another job right away...

620
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,617
...I can always work. I'm strong.

621
00:44:01,121 --> 00:44:02,782
But you mustn't get sick.

622
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,919
You mustn't get sick and die.

623
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:10,330
Because I don't want to live
in this world without you.

624
00:44:13,767 --> 00:44:16,998
I don't want you
to leave me alone here, Mel.

625
00:44:17,971 --> 00:44:20,303
I don't like it here.

626
00:44:23,177 --> 00:44:24,701
We'll show them.

627
00:44:25,646 --> 00:44:27,739
We'll show them all.

628
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,431
- Wayne, this is the lady you were expecting.
- Edna Reale?

629
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:59,375
- No. It's Edison now.
- I'm Wayne Morgan. Thank you, Jack.

630
00:44:59,546 --> 00:45:03,380
Cooperman told me you were a hell
of a production assistant in your day.

631
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:06,018
Yeah, in my day. Well, what am I in for?

632
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:09,019
Easiest job in the world.
Just give up your home life.

633
00:45:09,189 --> 00:45:11,783
Will you sit here?
We're having a reading now.

634
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,519
- We'll need a breakdown tonight.
- Tonight?

635
00:45:14,695 --> 00:45:18,153
- Sorry.
- That's show biz.

636
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:45,655
Fine, Ed. Fine. Ed...

637
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:50,354
...I thought I'd take you up on that
offer you made to have lunch sometime.

638
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:54,695
You always said you wished you
had a man like me with the company.

639
00:45:55,469 --> 00:45:58,927
After the 15th?
Swell, I'll give you a call.

640
00:45:59,106 --> 00:46:01,939
After the 15th. Right.

641
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,943
Right. Yeah.

642
00:46:50,691 --> 00:46:52,352
Name, please?

643
00:46:52,526 --> 00:46:55,757
Edison. It's right there on the card.

644
00:46:55,929 --> 00:46:58,523
And how long have you
been unemployed, Mr. Edison?

645
00:46:58,699 --> 00:47:01,463
- Ten weeks now.
- Ten weeks, was that?

646
00:47:02,169 --> 00:47:06,401
Monday will mark the 10th anniversary
of my unemployment.

647
00:47:07,274 --> 00:47:10,141
Have you been looking for employment
in the past week...?

648
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:12,471
I've been looking in the past week.

649
00:47:12,679 --> 00:47:16,376
I've been looking for the past
10 weeks now. That's why I'm here.

650
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:20,680
- Have you turned down any employment...?
- Have I turned down any employment...?

651
00:47:20,854 --> 00:47:24,483
I haven't turned down any employment.
Why should I?

652
00:47:24,658 --> 00:47:26,148
Why do you always...?

653
00:47:26,326 --> 00:47:29,659
If I'm coming here every week,
why would I turn down employment?

654
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:33,129
- That's why I'm unemployed, for Christ...
- Then the answer is no.

655
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:38,067
Right. Yes. No. That's the answer.
Write down no. No.

656
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:39,762
Twenty-two off.

657
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,202
Eighteen off.

658
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:43,002
- Twelve on.
- Twelve on.

659
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:17,406
Mel.

660
00:48:17,578 --> 00:48:19,341
Mel, I'm home.

661
00:48:19,613 --> 00:48:21,672
Hi, love. How are you?

662
00:48:21,848 --> 00:48:24,578
We need a shave, don't we?

663
00:48:25,185 --> 00:48:29,383
You must be starved. I just couldn't
get out of the studio before 8:00.

664
00:48:29,556 --> 00:48:31,786
They're still there working.

665
00:48:31,959 --> 00:48:34,587
I told them I just couldn't stay.

666
00:48:36,563 --> 00:48:40,932
I got us a cheese soufflé. It'll only take
a couple of minutes to heat it up again.

667
00:48:41,101 --> 00:48:43,262
I brought you <i>Sports Illustrated</i>.

668
00:48:43,437 --> 00:48:48,067
There's a terrific story about the Knicks.
He thought you might get a kick out of it.

669
00:48:48,241 --> 00:48:50,675
Here you are.
Everybody's working like crazy...

670
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:54,473
...hoping we can finish
this Christmas show before the weekend.

671
00:48:54,648 --> 00:48:56,980
Otherwise, we may have to go in.

672
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:58,742
I'm just not going.

673
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:01,810
I mean, I see you little enough as it is.

674
00:49:02,589 --> 00:49:04,250
Oh, boy.

675
00:49:06,727 --> 00:49:08,592
Oh, that's good.

676
00:49:08,795 --> 00:49:11,320
That's the first food
I've had since yesterday...

677
00:49:11,498 --> 00:49:13,659
...that wasn't from a vending machine.

678
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:15,802
Sit down. Have dinner and talk to me.

679
00:49:15,969 --> 00:49:18,460
I don't have the energy
to talk when I get home.

680
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:21,335
I don't know how I do it.
I've been saving energy...

681
00:49:21,508 --> 00:49:23,066
...for the past 22 years.

682
00:49:23,243 --> 00:49:26,872
How are you, sweetheart?
You feeling all right?

683
00:49:30,484 --> 00:49:31,974
Well?

684
00:49:33,453 --> 00:49:35,148
You feel all right?

685
00:49:36,757 --> 00:49:38,884
You don't feel like talking?

686
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:45,259
Come on, Mel. I haven't seen you
since breakfast yesterday...

687
00:49:45,465 --> 00:49:47,865
...and I'm gonna be fast asleep
in 15 minutes.

688
00:49:48,035 --> 00:49:49,832
Talk to me. What did you do today?

689
00:49:50,137 --> 00:49:51,536
I took a walk.

690
00:49:52,606 --> 00:49:56,303
- Good. Where?
- From the bedroom into the living room.

691
00:49:56,543 --> 00:49:59,706
- That's all?
- Then I walked back into the bedroom.

692
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:02,474
Once I went into the kitchen
for a glass of water.

693
00:50:02,649 --> 00:50:05,880
I'd say that was my high peak
of the day.

694
00:50:07,454 --> 00:50:09,422
Okay, you don't feel like talking...

695
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,250
Want to hear about my morning?

696
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:14,258
- It's all right.
- I looked outside three times...

697
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,828
...I listened to the radio...

698
00:50:16,997 --> 00:50:18,487
...and I went to the toilet.

699
00:50:18,665 --> 00:50:21,327
Which is still flushing,
but I didn't jiggle it...

700
00:50:21,501 --> 00:50:24,470
...because I know you like
to do that when you come home.

701
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,664
You didn't sleep well again last night.

702
00:50:27,841 --> 00:50:31,299
Was last night the night before
this morning? I get them mixed up.

703
00:50:31,478 --> 00:50:33,946
My life is so busy.

704
00:50:34,848 --> 00:50:37,373
I thought you were gonna
take a walk in the park.

705
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:41,578
There's no place left for me to walk.
I know every path and bridge and stone.

706
00:50:41,755 --> 00:50:45,816
I know every squirrel in the park
and I know where they all bury their nuts.

707
00:50:45,992 --> 00:50:49,519
Maybe tomorrow I can sneak an hour off,
and we can have lunch...

708
00:50:49,696 --> 00:50:53,530
...in the zoo.
- I've been to the zoo every day for 34 days.

709
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,760
Every time I pass the monkeys,
they say, "He's here again."

710
00:50:56,937 --> 00:50:58,666
Give me the fork.

711
00:50:58,839 --> 00:51:02,366
- Did anyone call?
- Your mother. We exchanged recipes.

712
00:51:04,077 --> 00:51:05,476
Anyone else?

713
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,203
I'm not an answering service.

714
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:10,781
You want me to answer the phone,
hire me, I could use the work.

715
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:15,250
I take it then there was nothing
in the paper today.

716
00:51:15,422 --> 00:51:17,913
- About what?
- About a job!

717
00:51:18,091 --> 00:51:19,991
Well, certainly, Edna.

718
00:51:20,627 --> 00:51:25,087
There's lots of jobs.
Cooks, dishwashers, male nurses.

719
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,232
Delta is looking for hostesses...

720
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,494
...but I don't wanna be away from home
that much.

721
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:35,970
Do you want me to give up my job
and hang around the house with you?

722
00:51:36,143 --> 00:51:39,670
I think this arrangement is fine.
You've been so nice to me.

723
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:43,407
Pay the rent, buy the food,
bought me a new sports jacket.

724
00:51:43,583 --> 00:51:47,383
Who knows, maybe next year you'll
take me to Hawaii for our anniversary.

725
00:51:47,888 --> 00:51:51,016
- Stop torturing yourself.
- I don't have to torture myself.

726
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,749
I got a lot of help.

727
00:51:52,926 --> 00:51:55,019
Dogs and flushing toilets.

728
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,595
The Red Baron's two sisters in there.

729
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,299
- What time would you like breakfast?
- Will you stop it?

730
00:52:04,471 --> 00:52:06,439
It's no problem. I mean I'm up...

731
00:52:06,606 --> 00:52:10,474
...l've got eggs, and I steal
the milk from the people next door.

732
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:13,875
And if I'm real quick,
I can get <i>The New York Times</i> too.

733
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:20,384
We'll talk when you're in a better mood.

734
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:25,184
I'm just trying to contribute, Edna.

735
00:52:25,826 --> 00:52:28,920
Just trying to do my share. I don't know.

736
00:52:33,266 --> 00:52:35,427
<i>This is Charles Tracker</i>
<i>and the 8 a.m. News.</i>

737
00:52:35,602 --> 00:52:37,763
<i>"We won't go back to work"</i>
<i>was the cry...</i>

738
00:52:37,938 --> 00:52:40,406
<i>... of 47 state and federal judges</i>
<i>today...</i>

739
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,099
<i>... defying the court order</i>
<i>of Judge Ackerman.</i>

740
00:52:43,276 --> 00:52:47,406
<i>Speaking for the striking judges, Judge</i>
<i>Precona told this to Bethesda Wayne:</i>

741
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:52,177
<i>"We will not go back to work and</i>
<i>we ain't working until this gets settled. "</i>

742
00:53:33,526 --> 00:53:35,721
I'll get some coffee down at the office.

743
00:53:35,896 --> 00:53:38,763
- I'll try to be home early.
- Don't work too hard, dear.

744
00:53:38,932 --> 00:53:43,494
Leave me some quarters for the Laundromat.
I've got so much wash to do today.

745
00:53:44,404 --> 00:53:46,804
Please, let's not start
the day out like this.

746
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:50,773
Here's something interesting.
"Maurice Le Pew in Queens."

747
00:53:50,944 --> 00:53:54,072
He wants a hairstylist.
Maybe I'll practice on you tonight...

748
00:53:54,247 --> 00:53:57,546
...and if you don't go bald,
I'll give him a call tomorrow.

749
00:53:58,118 --> 00:54:01,144
- You know what I'd suggest?
- What would you suggest, Edna?

750
00:54:01,588 --> 00:54:05,581
I suggest you get a tight grip on
yourself or find somebody to help you.

751
00:54:05,759 --> 00:54:09,024
I don't need any help.
I'm retired. I got it made.

752
00:54:09,195 --> 00:54:10,719
You know what I mean.

753
00:54:10,897 --> 00:54:12,626
Medical help. A doctor.

754
00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:15,131
Someone who can straighten you out...

755
00:54:15,302 --> 00:54:17,896
...because I'm running out
of energy and patience.

756
00:54:19,205 --> 00:54:21,332
You have enough for Mr. Cooperman!

757
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:28,071
And what does that mean?

758
00:54:28,245 --> 00:54:30,076
What does that mean?

759
00:54:31,282 --> 00:54:35,378
It just means you seem to have enough
patience and energy for Mr. Cooperman.

760
00:54:35,553 --> 00:54:38,147
Lots of laughs down
at the office, right?

761
00:54:41,592 --> 00:54:45,688
Listen, I know what goes on down there.
I used to be one of the boys too.

762
00:54:46,163 --> 00:54:48,358
Oh, yeah?
Well, I am not one of the girls.

763
00:54:48,532 --> 00:54:50,591
How come you get home
at 7 or 8:00...

764
00:54:50,768 --> 00:54:53,931
...when everybody knows
that no one works past 5 anymore?

765
00:54:54,105 --> 00:54:57,040
- I work past 5...
- Where, at Charley O's bar?

766
00:54:57,208 --> 00:55:02,441
I understand. Just a little drink to unwind
before coming home to face the little man.

767
00:55:02,613 --> 00:55:06,845
- I don't believe this.
- You used to when I came home at 7.

768
00:55:08,252 --> 00:55:11,346
Mel, I think we better have
a long talk tonight...

769
00:55:11,522 --> 00:55:13,387
...a long, serious talk.

770
00:55:14,358 --> 00:55:16,918
My begonias are coming up beautifully.

771
00:55:17,094 --> 00:55:20,495
Well, that's because Daddy's here
to take such nice care of them.

772
00:55:20,664 --> 00:55:22,529
Gently, gently.

773
00:55:24,535 --> 00:55:27,470
Gently, gently.

774
00:55:33,043 --> 00:55:34,533
Very gently.

775
00:56:00,104 --> 00:56:02,299
- Help you, Mr. Edison?
- Don't touch it.

776
00:56:02,773 --> 00:56:04,434
Come here.

777
00:56:13,818 --> 00:56:15,615
Here, here.

778
00:56:20,891 --> 00:56:23,257
- You know the guy in 15B?
- 15B?

779
00:56:23,427 --> 00:56:26,555
- 15B. The floor right above me.
- Above you? Mr. Jacoby.

780
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,254
Jacoby!

781
00:56:28,432 --> 00:56:31,424
- What time does he get home from work?
- About 6:00.

782
00:56:31,602 --> 00:56:33,263
About or exactly?

783
00:56:33,437 --> 00:56:35,462
- Usually about 6.
- About 6.

784
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:40,167
- Why?
- Nothing, nothing. It's perfect, perfect.

785
00:56:40,344 --> 00:56:44,178
- Want me to give a message?
- No, I'll give him the message.

786
00:56:44,348 --> 00:56:46,816
I got my own message.

787
00:57:03,434 --> 00:57:07,632
Look, I'm very tired. Would you mind
trying your perversions on someone else?

788
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:28,255
- What's funny?
- Nothing. Nothing's funny.

789
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:32,255
Then why are you laughing?

790
00:57:34,164 --> 00:57:35,791
Private joke.

791
00:57:38,202 --> 00:57:39,931
You're not gonna tell me, Mel?

792
00:57:40,104 --> 00:57:42,595
- I could use a good laugh.
- When the time comes.

793
00:57:42,773 --> 00:57:45,674
When the time comes.

794
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,459
- Mel, you're staring at me.
- Well, I'm sorry.

795
00:58:12,236 --> 00:58:15,728
- What is it?
- Am I allowed to turn back now?

796
00:58:15,906 --> 00:58:19,342
- Yes, you may turn back now.
- What was your question, Edna?

797
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:24,738
It's the same as every night, every meal,
every time we're together.

798
00:58:24,982 --> 00:58:27,450
- What's wrong?
- Do you feel something is wrong?

799
00:58:27,618 --> 00:58:31,645
Yes. I think you're miserable and tormented
because you're out of work.

800
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:34,219
- Now, that's it, isn't it?
- Only part...

801
00:58:34,391 --> 00:58:39,761
...Edna, only part of it. Now, you tell me,
why do you think I'm out of work?

802
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,958
I don't know why.

803
00:58:45,135 --> 00:58:49,572
- Because you can't find a decent job.
- That's why? That's why?

804
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:53,335
You haven't the slightest inkling
of what's really going on, do you?

805
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:56,308
You are so naive, it's ridiculous.

806
00:58:57,314 --> 00:59:02,877
- Mel, what are you talking about?
- You have no suspicion of the truth.

807
00:59:03,387 --> 00:59:08,552
- What truth are you talking about?
- I'm talking about the plot, Edna, the plot.

808
00:59:10,961 --> 00:59:13,623
- What plot, Mel?
- "What plot, Mel?"

809
00:59:13,797 --> 00:59:18,598
What plot? I'm talking about the plot,
and all you can say is, "What plot, Mel?"

810
00:59:18,769 --> 00:59:21,431
You say there's a plot.
I don't know what you mean.

811
00:59:21,605 --> 00:59:26,770
- So all I can say is, "What plot, Mel?"
- "What plot, Mel?" There. Jesus.

812
00:59:27,044 --> 00:59:28,705
What plot? What plot?

813
00:59:28,879 --> 00:59:32,542
A social, economic and political plot
to undermine the working classes...

814
00:59:32,716 --> 00:59:34,206
...of this country.

815
00:59:35,419 --> 00:59:37,580
Oh, that plot.

816
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:40,255
Yes, that plot.

817
00:59:45,629 --> 00:59:49,121
You know, instead of rushing downtown
every morning, stay home.

818
00:59:49,299 --> 00:59:51,699
Listen to the radio,
find out what's going on.

819
00:59:51,869 --> 00:59:54,929
Listen to the talk shows, you'll find
out what's going on.

820
00:59:55,105 --> 00:59:59,838
- Well, what's going on in this country?
- If you don't know, I'm not gonna tell you.

821
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:04,242
Mel, I'm your wife. You can tell me.

822
01:00:04,415 --> 01:00:07,179
If you're too lazy, ignorant
and uninformed...

823
01:00:07,351 --> 01:00:09,683
...to find out what is going on...

824
01:00:09,853 --> 01:00:13,448
...then you deserve exactly what
you're gonna get. All of you.

825
01:00:21,432 --> 01:00:24,265
Mel, would you like some
caramel custard?

826
01:00:24,435 --> 01:00:25,925
Come here.

827
01:00:29,373 --> 01:00:32,467
Now, I'm gonna tell you something,
and it may frighten you.

828
01:00:35,012 --> 01:00:36,172
Sit down.

829
01:00:38,482 --> 01:00:41,451
Not here! In there.

830
01:00:45,556 --> 01:00:47,820
Away from the wall.

831
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:50,482
There is a plot going on
in this country.

832
01:00:50,661 --> 01:00:54,290
Very complicated, very sophisticated!
It's practically invisible!

833
01:00:54,465 --> 01:00:59,061
And maybe only a handful of people
in this whole country know about it.

834
01:00:59,236 --> 01:01:01,830
- And they told it on the radio?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

835
01:01:02,005 --> 01:01:04,496
- Then everyone heard it.
- Well, did you hear it?

836
01:01:04,675 --> 01:01:06,404
- No.
- Then maybe everybody didn't.

837
01:01:06,577 --> 01:01:11,105
Who's listening to a radio at 10:00 in
the morning? They're all working. I heard it.

838
01:01:11,281 --> 01:01:13,943
And as sure as you are sitting here
in this room...

839
01:01:14,118 --> 01:01:18,214
...there is a plot going on
in this country today.

840
01:01:18,689 --> 01:01:21,283
- Against whom?
- Against me!

841
01:01:21,458 --> 01:01:24,222
- The whole country?
- Well, not against me personally.

842
01:01:24,394 --> 01:01:28,524
But they're after you, our kids,
my family, every one of our friends.

843
01:01:28,699 --> 01:01:32,032
They're after the cops, hippies,
the government, women's lib...

844
01:01:32,202 --> 01:01:36,571
...the blacks, the fag, the whole
military complex and even more.

845
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:39,368
Who? You mentioned everybody,
there's no one left.

846
01:01:39,543 --> 01:01:42,273
Oh, baby, there's someone left,
all right.

847
01:01:42,946 --> 01:01:46,245
Would you like me to give you actual
indisputable proof...

848
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:50,250
...that 6.7% of the working class
of this country is unemployed...

849
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:53,821
...and not because of a recession
or wages and high prices...

850
01:01:53,991 --> 01:01:59,588
...but because of a well-organized,
calculated, brilliantly-conceived plot?

851
01:01:59,763 --> 01:02:03,221
Would you like me to give you proof
right here and now?

852
01:02:04,434 --> 01:02:08,097
- Okay.
- I can't give you any proof!

853
01:02:08,472 --> 01:02:13,068
What the hell proof have I got? I can't
work. That's my proof! They won't let me!

854
01:02:14,611 --> 01:02:16,579
Mel, who's behind the plot?

855
01:02:16,747 --> 01:02:19,238
Is it the kids? The addicts?
The Army? The Navy?

856
01:02:19,416 --> 01:02:22,544
- The book-of-the-month club? Who?
- It is the human race!

857
01:02:24,054 --> 01:02:26,420
The deterioration of the spirit of man.

858
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:31,152
Man undermining himself,
causing a self-willed, self-imposed...

859
01:02:31,328 --> 01:02:36,698
...self-evident self-destruction.
That's who it is.

860
01:02:38,402 --> 01:02:40,802
- The human race, Mel?
- Yes.

861
01:02:41,338 --> 01:02:44,432
The human race is responsible
for the unemployment?

862
01:02:44,608 --> 01:02:46,405
You're surprised, aren't you?

863
01:02:47,444 --> 01:02:49,378
I never would have guessed.

864
01:02:49,546 --> 01:02:52,208
All the time, I kept thinking
it was somebody else.

865
01:02:52,382 --> 01:02:55,112
Don't mock me.
Damn it! Don't do that to me!

866
01:02:55,285 --> 01:02:57,651
Don't patronize me
and don't mock me!

867
01:02:59,323 --> 01:03:02,622
- I wasn't mocking you.
- You don't understand the first thing...

868
01:03:02,793 --> 01:03:06,388
...l'm talking about. You don't know
what it is to be in my place...

869
01:03:06,563 --> 01:03:08,861
...to stand in an unemployment line.

870
01:03:09,032 --> 01:03:14,129
You've never walked into your building and
had an idiot doorman with beer breath...

871
01:03:14,304 --> 01:03:16,534
...giggling at you
because he's working.

872
01:03:16,707 --> 01:03:21,474
You've never stood on your terrace and
been hit in the head with a bucket of water.

873
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:26,140
And I haven't forgotten that son of a bitch!
I haven't forgotten you!

874
01:03:26,316 --> 01:03:29,547
- You son of a bitch!
- Mel.

875
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:33,053
- Mel, listen to me...
- He thinks I don't know what he looks like.

876
01:03:33,223 --> 01:03:36,715
- I know what he looks like.
- I want you to see a doctor right away.

877
01:03:36,893 --> 01:03:40,829
Hell, I know what they all look like!
Got their faces engraved in my brain.

878
01:03:40,998 --> 01:03:43,296
Someone gave me the name
of a doctor.

879
01:03:43,467 --> 01:03:47,563
He knows about people who are going
through exactly what you're going through.

880
01:03:47,738 --> 01:03:50,172
- I'm gonna call.
- They can take your clothes...

881
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:54,709
...your Chivas Regal, your television,
your job, but they can't take your brains.

882
01:03:54,878 --> 01:03:57,506
And that's my secret weapon,
my brains.

883
01:03:57,681 --> 01:04:01,947
And the snow! The snow.
God, I pray that it snows tomorrow.

884
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:03,916
I bought a snow shovel, Edna.
Wait!

885
01:04:04,087 --> 01:04:06,578
I'm gonna take the day off
and take you myself.

886
01:04:06,757 --> 01:04:10,056
- Hello, this is Mrs. Edna...
- And not a little snow shovel.

887
01:04:10,227 --> 01:04:13,993
One of those great big shovels!
You know, the kind they use at airports.

888
01:04:15,198 --> 01:04:21,262
Oh, I'll go without my shoes this winter,
but I'm not going without my shovel!

889
01:04:21,972 --> 01:04:25,840
I'll bury him so deep,
they'll have to salt him out.

890
01:04:27,544 --> 01:04:31,913
He gets home at 6:00. I checked
with the doorman. I gave him a $5 tip.

891
01:04:32,082 --> 01:04:35,574
I know what time you get home,
you mother!

892
01:04:35,752 --> 01:04:38,915
- Hey! Try using the service entrance!
- It's very important.

893
01:04:39,089 --> 01:04:43,617
- I got that blocked off too.
- Please, please, right away. Yes.

894
01:04:43,794 --> 01:04:46,388
Have you any idea, any conception
of the impact...

895
01:04:46,563 --> 01:04:50,761
...of two pounds of wet, solid, packed snow
falling from 14 floors?

896
01:04:50,934 --> 01:04:55,496
They'll find him in the basement.
In the garage, bastard!

897
01:04:55,672 --> 01:04:58,038
And I know what you look like!

898
01:04:58,208 --> 01:05:02,770
Yes. Well, it's very difficult
to talk about on the phone.

899
01:05:03,547 --> 01:05:06,209
No, it isn't for me.
It's for my...

900
01:05:06,383 --> 01:05:09,011
If it doesn't snow this winter,
I wait till next.

901
01:05:09,186 --> 01:05:10,517
My husband.

902
01:05:10,687 --> 01:05:12,780
Because I'm in no hurry, smart-ass!

903
01:05:12,956 --> 01:05:15,754
- No, no.
- Nothing but time.

904
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:20,558
No! No, not Wednesday! This is
an emergency! Didn't you hear that guy?

905
01:05:22,032 --> 01:05:25,490
<i>This is the news with Dan Roland.</i>
<i>In a midtown hotel today...</i>

906
01:05:25,669 --> 01:05:29,002
<i>... following a convention</i>
<i>of the National Psychiatric Society...</i>

907
01:05:29,172 --> 01:05:33,074
<i>... 17 of the leading psychiatrists</i>
<i>in the United States were trapped...</i>

908
01:05:33,243 --> 01:05:35,803
<i>... in an elevator for over 45 minutes.</i>

909
01:05:35,979 --> 01:05:40,439
<i>Panic broke out, and 12 of the doctors</i>
<i>were treated for hysteria.</i>

910
01:05:41,918 --> 01:05:45,046
- I had a dream last night.
- Yes.

911
01:05:45,222 --> 01:05:50,159
And in the dream, I was in bed,
but I couldn't sleep, but I was sleeping.

912
01:05:50,327 --> 01:05:52,625
- Yes.
- All right, now what does that mean?

913
01:05:52,796 --> 01:05:56,596
- Well, what does it mean to you?
- I don't know. It mean anything to you?

914
01:05:56,767 --> 01:05:59,361
It's more important to know
what it means to you.

915
01:05:59,536 --> 01:06:02,061
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I don't know, I'm not sure.

916
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:04,230
But I remember when I was a kid...

917
01:06:04,408 --> 01:06:08,003
...I used to sleep with my brother Harry
when I was 7 or 8.

918
01:06:08,178 --> 01:06:13,275
One night, I woke up, I looked at Harry,
and it suddenly occurred to me...

919
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:16,283
- Sorry, your time is up.
- Jesus!

920
01:06:20,157 --> 01:06:23,024
<i>This is Roger Kelting</i>
<i>and the 1:00 news.</i>

921
01:06:23,193 --> 01:06:26,356
<i>A Polish freighter,</i>
<i>the 6000-ton</i> Majorsky...

922
01:06:26,530 --> 01:06:30,261
<i>... sailed into New York Harbor</i>
<i>in a dense fog at 7 a.m. This morning...</i>

923
01:06:30,434 --> 01:06:32,698
<i>... and crashed</i>
<i>into the Statue of Liberty.</i>

924
01:06:32,869 --> 01:06:34,461
<i>Two seamen were injured.</i>

925
01:06:34,638 --> 01:06:37,766
<i>Electrical damage caused flickering</i>
<i>in Miss Liberty's torch.</i>

926
01:06:37,941 --> 01:06:42,002
<i>It was the first recorded maritime accident</i>
<i>involving the famed statue...</i>

927
01:06:42,179 --> 01:06:46,980
<i>... although the Polish freighter</i>
<i>had been in six previous sea collisions.</i>

928
01:06:57,127 --> 01:07:00,187
It's 20 to 2:00.
Can we talk business, please?

929
01:07:00,363 --> 01:07:04,231
I gotta get back to work, Edna's waiting.
Can we settle this quickly?

930
01:07:04,401 --> 01:07:06,369
- What are we gonna do?
- About what?

931
01:07:06,536 --> 01:07:09,699
About what. About the Suez Canal!
What are we here for?

932
01:07:09,873 --> 01:07:12,671
What did Pearl come from Lakewood for?
Our brother!

933
01:07:12,843 --> 01:07:15,573
Our sick brother
who had a nervous breakdown!

934
01:07:15,745 --> 01:07:18,043
Every time I hear it...

935
01:07:18,215 --> 01:07:21,412
What are you crying for now?
You've known for a week.

936
01:07:21,585 --> 01:07:25,544
Harry, let her cry if she wants.
She came all the way from Lakewood.

937
01:07:27,591 --> 01:07:31,721
All right, let's face the facts.
Mel needs help.

938
01:07:32,462 --> 01:07:36,455
- Who else would he go to but his family?
- You're right, Harry, who else?

939
01:07:36,633 --> 01:07:38,567
All right, this is my suggestion:

940
01:07:39,703 --> 01:07:41,728
We make Mel a loan.

941
01:07:41,905 --> 01:07:44,635
We all chip in X number of dollars
a week.

942
01:07:44,808 --> 01:07:47,174
He gets a job again,
then he can pay us back.

943
01:07:47,344 --> 01:07:50,711
Now, that's my suggestion,
what do you all think?

944
01:07:51,948 --> 01:07:53,916
How much is "X number of dollars"?

945
01:07:54,551 --> 01:07:56,041
X...

946
01:07:57,521 --> 01:07:59,216
X is X.

947
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:02,881
Is X.

948
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:06,829
I mean, is it a big X or a little X?

949
01:08:07,931 --> 01:08:12,425
It's not even an X. It's a blank
until we fill in X with a figure.

950
01:08:12,602 --> 01:08:14,160
That's right, it's a blank.

951
01:08:14,337 --> 01:08:16,999
I'm not complaining.
We have to do the right thing.

952
01:08:17,173 --> 01:08:22,236
But when you say it like that, it sounds
like a lot. I have limited capital, you know.

953
01:08:22,412 --> 01:08:24,141
Do you have unlimited capital?

954
01:08:24,314 --> 01:08:28,011
I wish I did. I'd give Mel
X number of dollars in a minute.

955
01:08:28,184 --> 01:08:29,674
Forget X!

956
01:08:30,687 --> 01:08:33,315
Forget I ever mentioned X.

957
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:36,118
The biggest expense
is gonna be the doctor, right?

958
01:08:36,293 --> 01:08:38,386
You mean a fancy psychiatrist.

959
01:08:38,562 --> 01:08:40,894
I'm beginning to see what X
is gonna come to.

960
01:08:41,064 --> 01:08:43,259
Maybe it's not even
a nervous breakdown.

961
01:08:43,433 --> 01:08:45,424
Doctors can be wrong too.

962
01:08:46,069 --> 01:08:50,699
They took out all my top teeth,
then found out it was kidney stones.

963
01:08:53,777 --> 01:08:57,406
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but when Mel was a tiny baby...

964
01:08:57,581 --> 01:09:01,039
...didn't you think his head
was too large for his body?

965
01:09:01,217 --> 01:09:04,380
Mel? Mel had a beautiful head.

966
01:09:04,554 --> 01:09:08,183
I'm not saying it wasn't.
I'm saying it was too large for his body.

967
01:09:08,358 --> 01:09:11,020
It always kept falling over to one side.

968
01:09:13,129 --> 01:09:15,563
I can't believe what I'm listening to.

969
01:09:17,334 --> 01:09:19,734
You're 113 years old
between the two of you...

970
01:09:19,903 --> 01:09:22,064
...and neither one of you
makes any sense!

971
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:23,967
Let's go to Edna's, please!

972
01:09:35,919 --> 01:09:40,151
Gotta get this settled before we go up.
We've all got to agree.

973
01:09:40,323 --> 01:09:43,622
Now, the most important thing
is that Mel gets well. Agreed?

974
01:09:43,793 --> 01:09:44,782
Agreed.

975
01:09:44,961 --> 01:09:49,261
The only way he's gonna get well is
he doesn't worry about doctor bills. Agreed?

976
01:09:49,432 --> 01:09:51,229
- Agreed.
- We see this to the end...

977
01:09:51,401 --> 01:09:56,703
...if it takes a week, a month, a year
or even five years. Agreed?

978
01:09:59,609 --> 01:10:02,077
Okay, we got a disagreement.

979
01:10:06,216 --> 01:10:09,481
Now, Edna, dear...

980
01:10:09,653 --> 01:10:12,816
...we know it's gonna take time
and it's gonna take money...

981
01:10:12,989 --> 01:10:16,550
...and that's why we're here.
- And I really appreciate your coming.

982
01:10:16,726 --> 01:10:20,457
It's all right, just tell us how much
you think the bills will come to.

983
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:24,088
That's very generous, but I couldn't
let you. Mel wouldn't let me.

984
01:10:24,267 --> 01:10:27,464
Don't be ridiculous.
Where are you gonna get money, a bank?

985
01:10:27,637 --> 01:10:31,073
You can't put up a nervous breakdown
as collateral.

986
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:36,343
But I have no idea how long
Mel will be in treatment.

987
01:10:36,513 --> 01:10:41,177
I mean, it may run as high
as $20-25,000.

988
01:10:45,321 --> 01:10:49,985
- Can I say something to you in private?
- We don't need any private discussions.

989
01:10:51,961 --> 01:10:53,656
Just found out what X is.

990
01:10:55,432 --> 01:10:59,095
Now, look, you and Pearl can put up
whatever you think you can afford!

991
01:10:59,269 --> 01:11:03,171
I'll make up the deficit!
If it's 15, if it's 20, if it's 25,000...

992
01:11:03,339 --> 01:11:08,208
...l'll see that it's taken care of as long
as Mel gets the best medical treatment.

993
01:11:08,912 --> 01:11:11,142
That's all I'm gonna say.

994
01:11:14,184 --> 01:11:16,049
I'm speechless.

995
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:19,447
- I don't know what to say.
- Nothing. You don't say nothing.

996
01:11:19,622 --> 01:11:21,590
We just wanna do the right thing.

997
01:11:21,758 --> 01:11:25,091
I know none of us have been very close
the last few years.

998
01:11:25,261 --> 01:11:28,788
Nine. Nine years was the last time
we were invited.

999
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:33,363
- Has it been that long?
- Nine.

1000
01:11:34,137 --> 01:11:36,037
Well, I suppose it's been my fault.

1001
01:11:36,206 --> 01:11:39,004
Anyway, I appreciate this
more than you can imagine...

1002
01:11:39,175 --> 01:11:43,202
...but we really don't need it.
- Of course you need it, don't be ridiculous.

1003
01:11:43,379 --> 01:11:46,041
No, over the years we've managed
to save something.

1004
01:11:46,216 --> 01:11:49,617
- And I have jewelry I can sell.
- You're not selling your jewelry.

1005
01:11:49,786 --> 01:11:52,653
Maybe she doesn't wear it anymore.
Let the woman talk.

1006
01:11:54,958 --> 01:11:57,893
Mel can cash in his insurance policy,
and I have my job.

1007
01:11:58,061 --> 01:12:01,519
I can manage whatever
the medical expenses come to.

1008
01:12:02,866 --> 01:12:04,891
But if you really wanna help...

1009
01:12:05,068 --> 01:12:07,229
...what I'm worried about
is Mel's future.

1010
01:12:07,403 --> 01:12:08,995
We all are, darling.

1011
01:12:09,172 --> 01:12:12,801
It isn't easy for a man Mel's age
to get a job, start all over again.

1012
01:12:12,976 --> 01:12:15,945
If he knew lighting fixtures,
I'd take him in a minute.

1013
01:12:16,112 --> 01:12:17,670
Certainly, my God.

1014
01:12:18,314 --> 01:12:22,683
If he could get out of New York
and move to the country somewhere...

1015
01:12:22,852 --> 01:12:27,516
...he'd be 100% better off.
- I agree with you 1000%.

1016
01:12:29,526 --> 01:12:34,657
I was thinking of a summer camp.
Mel is so wonderful with kids and sports.

1017
01:12:34,831 --> 01:12:37,800
There's a lovely place in Vermont
that's for sale.

1018
01:12:37,967 --> 01:12:40,333
We could have it for next summer.

1019
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:43,495
Don't you think Mel
would be better off there?

1020
01:12:43,673 --> 01:12:46,403
Again, 1000%.

1021
01:12:47,043 --> 01:12:48,704
They want $25,000 down.

1022
01:12:48,878 --> 01:12:53,542
So instead of giving it to us for the doctor,
will you lend it to us for the camp?

1023
01:12:54,284 --> 01:12:58,744
- $25,000 for a summer camp.
- The price is 100,000.

1024
01:12:58,922 --> 01:13:00,048
A hundred...?

1025
01:13:05,862 --> 01:13:08,888
A hundred thousand dollars
for a summer camp?

1026
01:13:09,065 --> 01:13:12,364
Run by a man that far away
from a nervous breakdown?

1027
01:13:13,369 --> 01:13:17,100
Lt'll take him till August to figure out
how to blow up the volleyball!

1028
01:13:17,273 --> 01:13:19,901
I thought you wanted
to do something, help him.

1029
01:13:20,076 --> 01:13:22,943
- We do wanna help him!
- Then help him!

1030
01:13:23,112 --> 01:13:26,047
Not when he's sick.
When he's better, we'll help him.

1031
01:13:27,283 --> 01:13:30,582
Is that how the rest of you feel?
Do you both agree with Harry?

1032
01:13:30,753 --> 01:13:33,244
I'm not familiar with Vermont.

1033
01:13:34,724 --> 01:13:37,192
I'd have to go up and see it first...

1034
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,885
...but I can't travel with my leg.

1035
01:13:41,764 --> 01:13:43,857
All right, forget it.

1036
01:13:44,167 --> 01:13:48,433
Forget the money. We don't need it.
We'll do without it very nicely, thank you.

1037
01:13:48,605 --> 01:13:50,300
I'm surprised you even offered.

1038
01:13:50,473 --> 01:13:54,068
It's good to know that the minute
Mel is completely recovered...

1039
01:13:54,244 --> 01:13:58,442
...that I can count on you for help!
That's just when we'll need it!

1040
01:13:59,315 --> 01:14:02,250
Please excuse me,
I have to get back to the office.

1041
01:14:02,418 --> 01:14:07,583
And in case I don't see you for another nine
years, I'll get you some homemade cookies!

1042
01:14:08,057 --> 01:14:09,922
Mel made them.

1043
01:14:35,952 --> 01:14:38,580
Hello, darling. How did it go?

1044
01:14:38,755 --> 01:14:40,746
Fine. We had a good session today.

1045
01:14:40,924 --> 01:14:44,155
Could I have some water?
My mouth is very dry from the pills.

1046
01:14:44,327 --> 01:14:48,127
- Of course. Sit down. Did you walk home?
- I walked home.

1047
01:14:48,298 --> 01:14:52,359
- I had a nice walk. Hello, Harry.
- Hello, Mel.

1048
01:14:52,535 --> 01:14:55,504
- How you feeling?
- My mouth's a little dry.

1049
01:14:55,672 --> 01:14:58,869
I'm under sedation.
It calms me down. I feel fine.

1050
01:14:59,042 --> 01:15:01,169
Good. Good!

1051
01:15:01,377 --> 01:15:05,711
Look who's here, Mel.
Pearl and Pauline.

1052
01:15:06,683 --> 01:15:08,776
Hello, darling.

1053
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,920
How are you, baby?

1054
01:15:13,089 --> 01:15:17,355
My mouth's a little dry. I'm under sedation.
It quiets me down. I feel fine.

1055
01:15:17,527 --> 01:15:20,496
- Certainly.
- Of course, dear.

1056
01:15:21,264 --> 01:15:22,925
You look wonderful, Mel.

1057
01:15:23,099 --> 01:15:27,559
I walked home. Oh, I had a nice walk.
My mouth's a little dry, from the pills.

1058
01:15:27,737 --> 01:15:31,639
- Edna's getting you water, dear.
- Here you are, darling.

1059
01:15:33,042 --> 01:15:34,771
- Mel?
- Yes, Harry.

1060
01:15:35,678 --> 01:15:37,168
Mel...

1061
01:15:38,247 --> 01:15:42,183
- Harry wants to say something to you, Mel.
- What is it, Harry?

1062
01:15:46,923 --> 01:15:50,290
Nothing, Mel. Nothing.

1063
01:15:50,927 --> 01:15:55,057
You all seem worried.
Is someone in the family sick?

1064
01:15:56,833 --> 01:15:59,768
You don't look well to me, Ha...
You're working too hard!

1065
01:15:59,936 --> 01:16:02,370
- Don't work too hard, Harry.
- I won't.

1066
01:16:02,538 --> 01:16:06,406
You have to relax. Three things
I found out at the doctor's.

1067
01:16:06,576 --> 01:16:10,239
You have to relax, you mustn't
take the world too seriously...

1068
01:16:10,413 --> 01:16:14,907
...and you have to be very careful what
you say when you go out on the terrace.

1069
01:16:23,793 --> 01:16:25,761
<i>This is the 4:00 news.</i>

1070
01:16:25,928 --> 01:16:30,331
<i>Police today were baffled by an unusual</i>
<i>incident that took place in Central Park.</i>

1071
01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:32,991
<i>During the night,</i>
<i>a person or persons unknown...</i>

1072
01:16:33,169 --> 01:16:37,503
<i>... took a lawnmower to Sheep's Meadow</i>
<i>and mowed obscene words into the grass.</i>

1073
01:16:37,673 --> 01:16:40,801
<i>Until the parks department</i>
<i>decides to reseed the meadow...</i>

1074
01:16:40,977 --> 01:16:46,609
<i>... or cut the rest of the grass, the area</i>
<i>will be roped off to children under 17.</i>

1075
01:16:48,518 --> 01:16:50,008
Oh, God.

1076
01:16:50,453 --> 01:16:51,943
Yes?

1077
01:16:52,655 --> 01:16:54,020
God.

1078
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:56,590
Oh, am I gonna get that guy, Jacoby.

1079
01:16:56,759 --> 01:16:59,091
I know exactly where
and when he comes in.

1080
01:16:59,262 --> 01:17:02,663
At the first snow I'm gonna
fill my shovel with hard, wet snow...

1081
01:17:02,832 --> 01:17:07,360
...and drop it all 14 floors right on his head.
Crease his frigging skull!

1082
01:17:07,537 --> 01:17:09,027
God.

1083
01:17:09,338 --> 01:17:12,933
- You said that.
- For $50 an hour, I'll say what I want.

1084
01:17:13,109 --> 01:17:17,068
- A little hostile today, aren't we?
- No, not a little, a lot. Very hostile.

1085
01:17:17,246 --> 01:17:19,544
I may tear your couch up.
Put it in my bill.

1086
01:17:20,216 --> 01:17:22,582
- You wanna talk about it?
- No, I don't.

1087
01:17:22,752 --> 01:17:27,815
I've been talking about it for three months.
You clean that pipe and never say a word.

1088
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:31,118
My wife's out breaking her back
trying to pay for it all.

1089
01:17:31,294 --> 01:17:36,197
You ought to see her, she's turning herself
into an old woman just for me.

1090
01:17:37,033 --> 01:17:39,866
By the time I get better,
I'll be too young for her.

1091
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:43,468
That's funny.
Don't you think that's funny?

1092
01:17:43,639 --> 01:17:47,075
- I do see some humor to it, yes.
- You do?

1093
01:17:47,243 --> 01:17:49,837
Then it couldn't be funny.
You're like my brother.

1094
01:17:50,012 --> 01:17:54,210
- He laughs at the <i>Farmers' Almanac.</i>
- You don't talk about him. Do you like him?

1095
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:58,945
What the hell kind of a question is that?
Of course I like him. I love him! He's done...

1096
01:17:59,122 --> 01:18:02,523
- Why bring up my goddamn brother?
- Why "goddamn" if you like him?

1097
01:18:02,692 --> 01:18:07,186
Because I don't always like him. He can
be the dullest son of a bitch on two feet!

1098
01:18:07,363 --> 01:18:10,264
Do you think he'd ever play with me
as a kid? Hell, no.

1099
01:18:10,433 --> 01:18:13,425
All he ever did was complain
about my report card.

1100
01:18:13,603 --> 01:18:18,006
"You got a C in English and a C
in history. Forgot your lunch pail, Mel."

1101
01:18:18,174 --> 01:18:20,870
He wasn't my brother,
he was my father.

1102
01:18:22,812 --> 01:18:24,370
Hey, wait a minute, maybe...

1103
01:18:24,547 --> 01:18:27,072
Jesus. Maybe that's the key
to our relationship.

1104
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:31,346
That I was trying to prove to Harry,
my father...

1105
01:18:31,521 --> 01:18:35,685
...how successful I could be without
his help. And I never fought back to him!

1106
01:18:35,858 --> 01:18:40,295
I never fought back to anybody, and that's
why I'm here today! Isn't that true?

1107
01:18:40,463 --> 01:18:43,489
- Sorry, your time is up.
- Jesus!

1108
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:47,897
<i>In sports today, the Nassau Coliseum</i>
<i>opened its doors and its heart...</i>

1109
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:52,507
<i>... and will house a charity basketball game</i>
<i>between the Harlem Globetrotters...</i>

1110
01:18:52,675 --> 01:18:56,008
<i>... and a team made up of members</i>
<i>of the gay liberation movement.</i>

1111
01:18:56,179 --> 01:19:00,946
<i>The gay libbers said they did not expect</i>
<i>to win since their team is young...</i>

1112
01:19:01,117 --> 01:19:04,575
<i>... and have only been playing</i>
<i>with each other since December.</i>

1113
01:19:14,197 --> 01:19:16,859
- Watch it, will you?
- Sorry, man, I didn't see you.

1114
01:19:17,033 --> 01:19:21,197
You saw me! Don't tell me you didn't!
Tells me he didn't see m...

1115
01:19:24,574 --> 01:19:26,064
My wallet.

1116
01:19:26,442 --> 01:19:30,503
Why, that dirty bastard got my wallet.
Hey! Somebody stop him!

1117
01:20:36,245 --> 01:20:38,213
All right, hand it over.

1118
01:20:38,381 --> 01:20:41,214
- Hand it over!
- Are you crazy, man? What do you want?

1119
01:20:41,450 --> 01:20:44,419
Give me the wallet,
or I'll bust your head in!

1120
01:20:44,587 --> 01:20:47,522
I've taken all I'm gonna take
from you guys! The wallet!

1121
01:20:48,858 --> 01:20:50,325
Here!

1122
01:20:50,493 --> 01:20:51,983
Go on, get out of here.

1123
01:20:52,161 --> 01:20:55,255
Get out of here before I work you over.

1124
01:20:57,233 --> 01:21:00,202
And tell your friends
that I'm gonna get my shoes back!

1125
01:21:00,369 --> 01:21:02,667
And my brown suede shoes too!
You tell them!

1126
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:09,507
What happened?

1127
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:12,978
I'm getting tired of being shoved around,
that's what happened.

1128
01:21:13,149 --> 01:21:16,380
Curb your dog, will you?
People have to walk on these streets.

1129
01:21:37,006 --> 01:21:39,065
- Thanks for the help, Joe.
- Mrs. Edison.

1130
01:21:39,241 --> 01:21:41,709
- Is Mr. Edison home?
- I didn't see him come in.

1131
01:21:41,877 --> 01:21:45,404
Oh, Mrs. Edison! Elevator's out.

1132
01:21:45,581 --> 01:21:47,640
- What?
- Something with the cables.

1133
01:21:47,817 --> 01:21:50,217
It won't be fixed until about 8:00.

1134
01:21:50,386 --> 01:21:52,820
You mean I gotta walk up 14 floors?

1135
01:21:52,988 --> 01:21:54,478
Water's out too.

1136
01:21:54,657 --> 01:21:57,125
- What water? My water?
- Everyone's water.

1137
01:21:57,293 --> 01:22:00,421
They're working on the pipes now.
Should be on about 7:00.

1138
01:22:00,596 --> 01:22:04,259
You tell the superintendent
if I have to take a bath without water...

1139
01:22:04,433 --> 01:22:06,492
...l'm deducting it from the rent!

1140
01:22:06,669 --> 01:22:09,968
- You ought to live where I live.
- Never mind!

1141
01:22:38,334 --> 01:22:40,268
- Hiya, Joe.
- Hello, Mr. Edison.

1142
01:22:40,436 --> 01:22:42,336
- Mrs. Edison just went up.
- Oh, good.

1143
01:22:42,505 --> 01:22:44,336
And the elevator's out.

1144
01:22:44,507 --> 01:22:48,944
- You gotta walk up unless you wanna wait.
- For them? My lease will be up by then.

1145
01:22:49,111 --> 01:22:53,844
- Water's out too. No water till tonight.
- I'll pray for rain on the way up.

1146
01:23:19,175 --> 01:23:20,836
Hey, would you...?

1147
01:23:27,349 --> 01:23:29,715
You know I just walked up 14 flights?

1148
01:23:32,154 --> 01:23:35,851
You should've called me.
I'd have come and carried you.

1149
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:37,683
Hey, Edna, listen.

1150
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:41,261
Oh, please listen,
because I've got something to tell you.

1151
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:45,389
Do you know the water's off?
They stole our water, Mel, did they tell you?

1152
01:23:45,668 --> 01:23:48,899
I did something today, Edna.
I did something affirmative.

1153
01:23:49,071 --> 01:23:51,699
For the first time in four months,
I fought back!

1154
01:23:51,874 --> 01:23:55,139
I fought back! Oh, they didn't get away
with it this time.

1155
01:23:55,311 --> 01:23:57,711
- What are you talking about?
- I was mugged!

1156
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:00,007
In broad daylight!
They got my wallet!

1157
01:24:00,182 --> 01:24:02,980
What's the difference,
you didn't have anything in it.

1158
01:24:03,152 --> 01:24:06,315
What about my pride and my dignity?
I got my self-respect.

1159
01:24:06,489 --> 01:24:10,516
And they didn't get the wallet, either.
I chased some punk all over the park.

1160
01:24:10,693 --> 01:24:14,459
He was a good 20 years younger
than me too, but I got my wallet back.

1161
01:24:15,197 --> 01:24:16,562
See?

1162
01:24:16,732 --> 01:24:18,063
Your wallet is brown.

1163
01:24:19,268 --> 01:24:21,327
Your wallet is brown.
This one's black.

1164
01:24:21,504 --> 01:24:25,270
You left yours on the dresser this morning.
This isn't your wallet, Mel.

1165
01:24:32,481 --> 01:24:34,108
By God, I mugged a kid.

1166
01:24:35,417 --> 01:24:38,853
- I mugged some poor kid in the street.
- How much did we get?

1167
01:24:39,021 --> 01:24:41,785
- Why did he run?
- You chased him, didn't you?

1168
01:24:41,957 --> 01:24:44,755
- You get chased, you run.
- Wait, I gotta return that.

1169
01:24:44,927 --> 01:24:47,953
No! Some of this belongs to us!
They stole enough from us!

1170
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:52,499
- Everyone's gotta share its losses!
- Edna! But not that way!

1171
01:24:52,668 --> 01:24:56,195
Wait a minute, don't you understand?
Edna, will you be reasonable?

1172
01:24:56,372 --> 01:25:00,138
Don't you see the important thing?
Not the money, it's that I got angry.

1173
01:25:00,309 --> 01:25:02,607
I fought back!
I got my strength back!

1174
01:25:02,778 --> 01:25:05,975
I hope you're strong enough
for both of us. I'm out of work!

1175
01:25:06,148 --> 01:25:08,048
- We went out of business today!
- Who?

1176
01:25:08,217 --> 01:25:11,015
We did! The business that I'm in
went out of business!

1177
01:25:11,186 --> 01:25:15,680
They canceled a show, they lost three
accounts, they went out of business!

1178
01:25:15,858 --> 01:25:19,919
- They let you go?
- If they're not staying, they don't need me!

1179
01:25:20,296 --> 01:25:22,992
Oh, Mel.
What's happening?

1180
01:25:23,165 --> 01:25:26,464
- Is the whole world going out of business?
- It'll be all right.

1181
01:25:26,635 --> 01:25:31,470
I don't understand how a big business
like that could just go out of business.

1182
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:36,543
It was a big business with desks and
cabinets and beautiful pictures on the walls.

1183
01:25:36,712 --> 01:25:39,340
Edna, it's just a job,
it's not your whole life.

1184
01:25:39,515 --> 01:25:43,884
You know what I kept thinking about on
the way home? One thing. Only one thing.

1185
01:25:44,053 --> 01:25:49,184
A bath. A nice, hot bath.
And now the water went out of business!

1186
01:25:49,358 --> 01:25:51,792
- It'll come back on.
- I want my bath!

1187
01:25:51,961 --> 01:25:55,453
I want my water!
You tell them I want my bath!

1188
01:25:55,631 --> 01:25:59,294
- What can I do about it?
- You bang on the pipes! Bang on the pipes!

1189
01:25:59,468 --> 01:26:02,369
Tell them there's a woman
who needs an emergency bath!

1190
01:26:02,538 --> 01:26:06,099
If I don't sit in some hot water,
I'm gonna go crazy. Now, bang!

1191
01:26:06,275 --> 01:26:09,210
- Be reasonable.
- I banged for you. Why won't you for me?

1192
01:26:09,378 --> 01:26:12,040
Lt'll be all right, Edna!
Lt'll be all right.

1193
01:26:12,214 --> 01:26:14,614
It won't be all right!
It won't be all right!

1194
01:26:14,783 --> 01:26:17,809
Why do you keep saying that?
Are you out of your mind?

1195
01:26:21,323 --> 01:26:22,813
Oh, Mel...

1196
01:26:23,626 --> 01:26:25,184
...l'm so sorry.

1197
01:26:25,361 --> 01:26:27,852
- Oh, God, I didn't mean that.
- It's all right.

1198
01:26:28,030 --> 01:26:30,157
- Oh, please forgive me.
- Just calm down.

1199
01:26:30,332 --> 01:26:33,733
Gee, I don't know
what I'm saying anymore.

1200
01:26:33,902 --> 01:26:35,893
Oh, I have no strength left.

1201
01:26:36,071 --> 01:26:39,336
Nothing. I couldn't even open
my pocketbook on the bus today.

1202
01:26:39,508 --> 01:26:43,069
- A little boy had to help me.
- You have strength, Edna.

1203
01:26:43,245 --> 01:26:46,214
I have anger!

1204
01:26:46,448 --> 01:26:48,575
No strength.

1205
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:51,784
If anything happens to me,
who's gonna take care of us?

1206
01:26:51,954 --> 01:26:54,582
I will! Haven't I always
taken care of you, Edna?

1207
01:26:54,757 --> 01:26:58,056
- I mean, who's gonna take care of us now?
- Me.

1208
01:26:58,227 --> 01:27:00,422
Edna, me.

1209
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,534
- You, Mel?
- Trust me.

1210
01:27:07,703 --> 01:27:10,001
Don't you believe in me anymore?

1211
01:27:14,543 --> 01:27:17,569
Let's leave.
Let's just give up and leave!

1212
01:27:17,746 --> 01:27:22,080
Let them keep their garbage and crooks
and air conditioners and jobs!

1213
01:27:22,251 --> 01:27:25,118
I just wanna live out
the rest of my life with you.

1214
01:27:25,287 --> 01:27:28,222
And see my girls grow up
healthy and happy.

1215
01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:31,689
And once in a while I'd like to have
some water to take a bath!

1216
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:35,591
- Please, Mel, please.
- Edna, it's going to be all right.

1217
01:27:35,764 --> 01:27:39,757
But we're not gonna let them kick us out.
This is my city. We're gonna stay!

1218
01:27:39,935 --> 01:27:42,768
And you're gonna get some water,
I promise you.

1219
01:27:43,505 --> 01:27:44,995
Yeah?

1220
01:27:45,808 --> 01:27:50,040
- That's the superintendent, I'll kill him!
- You're very upset, I'll handle this.

1221
01:27:50,212 --> 01:27:54,478
Just relax. Why don't you sit in the tub
and wait for the water to come on, huh?

1222
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:58,313
Tell him I want a whole tubful,
not just two inches! You tell him!

1223
01:27:58,487 --> 01:28:00,318
- Yeah.
- Tell him!

1224
01:28:06,695 --> 01:28:09,095
I'd like to talk to you, Mel. Now.

1225
01:28:09,264 --> 01:28:12,165
I'm parked in a loading zone,
15 minutes.

1226
01:28:12,334 --> 01:28:16,532
I drove in from the country, walked up
these stairs. I don't wanna get a ticket.

1227
01:28:16,705 --> 01:28:18,639
- So can we talk?
- Sure. Come on in.

1228
01:28:19,441 --> 01:28:24,435
I'd rather not. I understand how Edna feels
about me. I don't wanna cause more trouble.

1229
01:28:24,613 --> 01:28:28,140
In the hallway, okay?
I'd like to talk in private. Okay?

1230
01:28:28,317 --> 01:28:30,217
In the hall?

1231
01:28:33,655 --> 01:28:37,523
Edna, I gotta go out for a few minutes!
Are you all right?

1232
01:28:37,693 --> 01:28:41,720
It's not flushing!
I can't flush the lousy toilet!

1233
01:28:41,897 --> 01:28:43,228
Can't flush the toilet.

1234
01:28:46,034 --> 01:28:48,434
How are you feeling, Mel?
Emotionally, I mean.

1235
01:28:48,604 --> 01:28:52,233
- Is it all right to say that?
- Emotionally? It's a very nice word.

1236
01:28:52,407 --> 01:28:54,875
I brought you some apples
from the country.

1237
01:28:55,043 --> 01:28:59,139
Wait'll you taste these. You always
used to love apples. I remember that.

1238
01:28:59,314 --> 01:29:02,647
- Are you allowed to eat them now?
- Apples don't affect the mind.

1239
01:29:02,818 --> 01:29:05,252
- They don't?
- Sure you don't wanna talk inside?

1240
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:07,183
No, no. Here is fine.

1241
01:29:07,356 --> 01:29:10,655
With all due respect to Edna,
she's very upset with the family.

1242
01:29:10,826 --> 01:29:13,886
Not true. She hasn't said one
unkind word about any of you.

1243
01:29:14,062 --> 01:29:17,327
The woman doesn't like me,
it's all right.

1244
01:29:17,499 --> 01:29:19,899
I wanted to deliver this in person.

1245
01:29:20,102 --> 01:29:24,596
You drove 40 miles and walked 14 flights
to bring me six apples, and I'm crazy?

1246
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:28,676
Not just the apples.
I have something a little more substantial.

1247
01:29:28,844 --> 01:29:31,779
Here. This is for you and Edna.
The apples are separate.

1248
01:29:31,947 --> 01:29:34,245
- What's this?
- It's the check, the money.

1249
01:29:34,416 --> 01:29:36,077
Go buy yourself a summer camp.

1250
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:40,244
July and August, go take care
of 300 runny noses. Have a good time.

1251
01:29:40,422 --> 01:29:42,686
This is for $25,000.

1252
01:29:42,858 --> 01:29:45,918
Your sisters and I contributed equally,
50-50.

1253
01:29:46,094 --> 01:29:48,927
I'm telling them about it tomorrow.

1254
01:29:49,631 --> 01:29:51,292
Harry? Hey, Harry!

1255
01:29:51,466 --> 01:29:53,627
Harry! Hey, I don't understand.

1256
01:29:53,802 --> 01:29:57,397
I don't understand myself. Why would
anybody wanna run a summer camp?

1257
01:29:57,606 --> 01:30:00,734
But if that's what gives you pleasure,
good luck, God bless.

1258
01:30:00,909 --> 01:30:02,604
Wait a minute.

1259
01:30:02,778 --> 01:30:05,747
- When did Edna ask you for this?
- What's the difference?

1260
01:30:05,914 --> 01:30:09,680
Everybody got excited, everybody
said some things that Edna didn't mean.

1261
01:30:09,852 --> 01:30:12,343
- Take it.
- Keep it. Take the money, buy a camp.

1262
01:30:12,521 --> 01:30:15,285
Now, go upstairs.
Walk slowly or you'll get a stitch.

1263
01:30:15,457 --> 01:30:18,483
Please, I can't explain,
but I cannot take this money.

1264
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:21,561
I am all right now.
I can stand on my own. Understand?

1265
01:30:21,730 --> 01:30:26,292
Why won't you let me do this for you?
Why won't you let me make you happy?

1266
01:30:26,468 --> 01:30:28,902
You already have by offering it.

1267
01:30:29,071 --> 01:30:32,472
Now, get rid of that. They see that,
you'll never make the corner.

1268
01:30:32,641 --> 01:30:37,772
You let everybody else take care of you.
Pearl, Edna, Pauline, everyone except me.

1269
01:30:37,946 --> 01:30:40,938
- Why am I always excluded from the family?
- Who knows?

1270
01:30:41,116 --> 01:30:44,608
I had to work when I was 13,
I didn't have time to be the favorite!

1271
01:30:44,786 --> 01:30:47,254
You wanna be the favorite?
I'll give it to you.

1272
01:30:47,422 --> 01:30:50,789
I'll call the girls up, say from now on,
you're the favorite.

1273
01:30:50,959 --> 01:30:53,086
I'm not blaming you.
It's only natural.

1274
01:30:53,262 --> 01:30:56,629
When there are two brothers,
and one is out working all day...

1275
01:30:56,798 --> 01:31:01,360
...the one who stays home is the favorite.
- I wasn't the favorite, I was the baby.

1276
01:31:01,536 --> 01:31:03,504
- You were the favorite!
- I was not!

1277
01:31:03,672 --> 01:31:06,038
They played with you
from morning till night!

1278
01:31:06,208 --> 01:31:10,167
No one could keep their hands off you!
I lived in that house 31 years!

1279
01:31:10,345 --> 01:31:13,143
Not once did anyone
sing me "Happy Birthday"!

1280
01:31:13,315 --> 01:31:15,909
That's not true, Harry!
You always had a party...

1281
01:31:16,084 --> 01:31:18,951
...and a great big cake!
- I had parties, I had cakes.

1282
01:31:19,121 --> 01:31:21,521
Nobody ever sang "Happy Birthday."

1283
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:24,716
This year, I'm gonna hire
the West Point Glee Club...

1284
01:31:24,893 --> 01:31:28,124
...and you're gonna hear "Happy Birthday"
like never before.

1285
01:31:28,297 --> 01:31:30,822
Eleven years old,
I was wearing long pants.

1286
01:31:30,999 --> 01:31:33,297
When I was 14, I had a little mustache!

1287
01:31:33,468 --> 01:31:38,132
At the movies, I had to bring my birth
certificate, or they charged me adult prices!

1288
01:31:38,307 --> 01:31:42,607
- You were the oldest living teenager.
- Did you ever see Pearl's family album?

1289
01:31:42,778 --> 01:31:46,145
There are no pictures of me as a boy!
I skipped right over it!

1290
01:31:46,315 --> 01:31:50,115
Thousands of pictures of you.
On ponies, on bicycles, in barber chairs.

1291
01:31:50,285 --> 01:31:54,415
One picture of me in a 1938 Buick.
I looked like Herbert Hoover.

1292
01:31:54,589 --> 01:31:56,386
I'm sorry, Harry.

1293
01:31:56,558 --> 01:32:00,460
I'm gonna tell you something now, Mel.
I've never told this to anybody.

1294
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:04,832
I don't think you got a brain for business.
You can't handle problems.

1295
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,992
I think you're a child, a baby,
a spoiled infant.

1296
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:11,833
But as God is my judge,
many's a night I lay in bed envying you.

1297
01:32:12,874 --> 01:32:14,739
Isn't that something?

1298
01:32:15,377 --> 01:32:20,440
What I've got, you'll never have, but what
you've got, I'd like to have just once.

1299
01:32:20,615 --> 01:32:24,107
Just to see what it feels like
to be the favorite.

1300
01:32:28,423 --> 01:32:31,187
What if I gave you a big fat kiss
on the mouth?

1301
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:34,420
You kiss me,
I'll break every bone in your body.

1302
01:32:48,543 --> 01:32:51,808
Between us, we don't have the brains
to push a button.

1303
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:53,845
I love you, Harry.

1304
01:32:55,984 --> 01:32:58,214
Now say you love
your little baby brother.

1305
01:32:58,387 --> 01:33:01,618
You're not better yet. You hear me?
You're not better yet!

1306
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:05,317
You're still a very sick man!

1307
01:33:15,637 --> 01:33:17,127
Edna!

1308
01:33:20,642 --> 01:33:23,941
Dear, I know you meant perfectly well...

1309
01:33:24,112 --> 01:33:26,444
...but I wish that...
Edna?

1310
01:33:26,615 --> 01:33:27,775
Edna.

1311
01:33:27,949 --> 01:33:31,612
I wish that in the future,
you wouldn't ask my family for $25,000...

1312
01:33:31,787 --> 01:33:34,847
...without first discussing it with me.
- Don't yell at me.

1313
01:33:35,023 --> 01:33:36,456
- Who's yelling?
- You!

1314
01:33:36,625 --> 01:33:40,618
- I'm being perfectly reasonable.
- Fill my tub, then be perfectly reasonable.

1315
01:33:40,796 --> 01:33:44,664
- How could you beg my family for money?
- They offered money for a doctor.

1316
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:49,270
I said I didn't need it for a doctor, I needed
it for a camp. I never begged anyone!

1317
01:33:49,438 --> 01:33:51,963
How am I gonna wash my hair?
With ginger ale?

1318
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:54,438
Can't you see?
I'm all right now.

1319
01:33:54,609 --> 01:33:56,873
It's humiliating for me
to ask for money.

1320
01:33:57,045 --> 01:34:00,242
You didn't ask them!
You weren't the one that was humiliated!

1321
01:34:00,415 --> 01:34:03,043
I was the one in front
of the Spanish Inquisition!

1322
01:34:03,218 --> 01:34:06,312
You were taking a nice
tranquilized walk in the park!

1323
01:34:06,488 --> 01:34:10,618
- Sedated, not tranquilized. I was sedated.
- I don't care if you were petrified.

1324
01:34:10,792 --> 01:34:14,990
I was the one that was humiliated.
Next time you be humiliated, I'll be sedated.

1325
01:34:15,163 --> 01:34:18,189
You're speaking to a man
who just had a nervous breakdown.

1326
01:34:18,366 --> 01:34:21,858
- That far away.
- I had a nervous breakdown! Don't tell me!

1327
01:34:22,037 --> 01:34:25,803
- Haven't you any regard for a man's illness?
- You don't sound sick now.

1328
01:34:25,974 --> 01:34:28,841
I'm not talking about now.
I'm talking about then.

1329
01:34:29,010 --> 01:34:31,877
And it was sedated, not tranquilized!
Sedated!

1330
01:34:32,047 --> 01:34:35,505
Well, I wish you'd get sedated again,
so you'd stop yelling at me!

1331
01:34:35,684 --> 01:34:38,312
Will you shut up down there,
you hoodlums!

1332
01:34:38,487 --> 01:34:42,218
- Hey. Hey!
- Edna! Oh, Jesus!

1333
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:46,827
- Who are you calling hoodlums?
- You! And your loudmouthed husband!

1334
01:34:47,462 --> 01:34:49,020
Don't you call us names!

1335
01:34:49,197 --> 01:34:51,791
Your husband isn't half the man
my husband is!

1336
01:34:51,967 --> 01:34:54,993
And we haven't forgotten the water.
We remember the water!

1337
01:34:55,203 --> 01:34:57,228
My husband'll be home soon!

1338
01:34:57,405 --> 01:35:00,340
And if you don't shut up,
you'll get more of the same!

1339
01:35:00,509 --> 01:35:06,277
With what? Where are you gonna get
the water? Where's your water, big mouth?

1340
01:35:06,915 --> 01:35:08,883
Edna... Will you get out of there?

1341
01:35:09,050 --> 01:35:12,144
I'm sorry, my wife didn't really...

1342
01:35:24,399 --> 01:35:26,299
They did it again.

1343
01:35:28,136 --> 01:35:30,104
Where'd they get the water?

1344
01:35:30,272 --> 01:35:33,400
- Where did they get it?
- People like that always have water.

1345
01:35:33,575 --> 01:35:36,942
They save it up so that people like us
can always get it.

1346
01:35:43,051 --> 01:35:45,952
Well, I think you're behaving
very well, Mel.

1347
01:35:46,121 --> 01:35:49,318
I think you're taking it beautifully
this time.

1348
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:51,752
That shows real progress.

1349
01:35:51,927 --> 01:35:55,920
I think you've grown
through this experience. I really do.

1350
01:35:57,065 --> 01:35:58,555
You know...

1351
01:35:58,867 --> 01:36:00,835
...I think you really are all right.

1352
01:36:02,804 --> 01:36:04,465
I'm so proud of you, Mel.

1353
01:36:05,807 --> 01:36:07,968
Because you're better than them.

1354
01:36:10,078 --> 01:36:12,171
You're better than all of them.

1355
01:36:14,015 --> 01:36:16,176
Better in every way.

1356
01:36:30,532 --> 01:36:32,898
<i>This is Roger Kelting</i>
<i>and the 6:00 report.</i>

1357
01:36:33,068 --> 01:36:36,333
<i>Heavy snow warnings posted</i>
<i>along the Eastern Seaboard tonight.</i>

1358
01:36:36,504 --> 01:36:39,962
<i>And here in New York,</i>
<i>a record 33 inches have been forecast.</i>

1359
01:36:40,242 --> 01:36:42,210
<i>Snowplows were ordered</i>
<i>on the streets.</i>

1360
01:36:42,377 --> 01:36:45,710
<i>City residents were asked</i>
<i>to get their shovels in a joint effort...</i>

1361
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:51,341
<i>... to show how New Yorkers can live</i>
<i>and work together in a common cause.</i>
