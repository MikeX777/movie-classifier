A King Hu Film

00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,200
<b>THE VALIANT ONES</b>
<i>~ PAL ~ 102:19 min. ~</i>

3
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,153
Many Chinese fishermen gathered
along the coastal areas.

4
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,995
Since the 13th century, Japanese ronin
gangs teamed up with local bandits

5
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,076
in the Pirate group.

6
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,033
Robbing and slaughtering everywhere.

7
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:59,194
In 16th century. National affairs were
disorganized. Administration lost control

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,196
Those pirate groups grew and grew

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,239
landing and wandering in Fujian and Zejiang

10
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,072
Wherever they passed by. They raped,
robbed and torched.

11
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,076
In the history book, it's
called Disaster of Ronin

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,036
The fiercest among them were:

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,158
Bodojin. Xudong and Caimen

14
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:28,154
The Government sent the army to annihilate
them many times. But always failed.

15
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,075
The defense project prepared by the King
Court to the Japanese Emperor failed

16
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:41,076
as some Chinese Officers and Japanese
Consulate took bribes from pirates.

17
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,118
It was impossible to get rid of all pirates.

18
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:52,076
Even the emperor got involved
in this matter.

19
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,198
The Ronin brought us so much trouble.
And the problem won't settle down.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,151
Your Majesty. Vice Attorney General Zu Zhe

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,156
submitted a memo the day before yesterday.

22
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,152
Have you read it yet? If it looks ok
to you, then let him do it.

23
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,156
Zu Zhe. Step out.

24
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,116
Your servant Zu Zhe is here.

25
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,032
Zu. I'll assign you a position like

26
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,996
Governor of Zejiang, Military
Commander of Zejiang and Fujian.

27
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,235
Right. Governor of Zejiang. Military
Commander of Zejiang and Fujian.

28
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,198
After you get there, you must
annihilate all Ronins.

29
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,113
For our country. You must
do it fast and swift.

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,075
You can go now.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,115
I'll obey your Command.

32
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,995
Governor of Zejiang.

33
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,076
It's been almost 2 months since I came here
and the pirates are behind over 30 cases!

34
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,035
General Zou.

35
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,117
You're in charge of military force.
Do you have any good ideas?

36
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,190
Governor. These pirates means nothing.

37
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,995
No use wasting our time
taking them serious.

38
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,075
only because we didn't
have a long-term plan.

39
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,075
Stop talking of these Ronins.

40
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,073
A chief of South native clan need to go
to Capital. Are you able to escort him?

41
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,115
I guarantee it in my name and title.

42
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,195
South native clan.

43
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,233
You lead guard and take the credit.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,193
Thanks. Governor.

45
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,995
Annihilating pirates is not so easy. Only
the strong and wise will make it.

46
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,073
I heard Guard of Zhangzou,
Yu dayou. is good at strategy.

47
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,036
He is my friends child.

48
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,155
He's very good.

49
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,234
Governor. Please give me more time. I'll
deal with the pirates. No need for help.

50
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,035
But I need someone reliable who can
escort the chief of South Clan out safely.

51
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,192
Governor. Yu Dayou is self-important
and arrogant.

52
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,155
It's incorrect.

53
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,155
I decided

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,037
I'll inform the emperor. You send a document
to Zhangzou. And get Yu Dayou here.

55
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,115
He is here.

56
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,155
Sir.

57
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,155
General Yu.

58
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,075
How are you?

59
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,035
I want to go back to
the camp with you.

60
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,115
Don't you feel comfortable here?

61
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,195
It's boring.

62
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,076
Have you recalled all the guys like I asked?

63
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,189
Yes.

64
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,035
Sir.

65
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,035
Keep blowing your flute.
It may lure a pirate here.

66
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,115
I'm expecting them.

67
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,035
Change your cloth quickly.

68
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,037
Li. How are the states of thing around here?

69
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,991
Robbed!

70
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,155
How about you?

71
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,195
They have never been to my place.

72
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,996
There's nothing of value here. But
they're coming soon, the Ronins.

73
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,155
Why?

74
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,995
Because you're here,

75
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,115
I mean, how dare they rob soldiers?

76
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,075
No different.

77
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,155
In which direction do
they com from mostly?

78
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,189
No one knows where their base is?

79
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,196
Do you think there are
any spies in your village?

80
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,196
Not only in my village. But
also in the government.

81
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,035
Beware.

82
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,196
Wang, did you ever try water-fried shrimp?

83
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,069
Oil-fried shrimp.

84
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,115
Water-fried-shrimp is much delicious.

85
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,155
Excuse me.

86
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,195
Archers. Let's do some exercise.

87
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,155
General.

88
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,075
Li.

89
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,075
This is for you.

90
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,995
Go buy yourself a new fish net.

91
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,236
No need. You got rid of the pirates for
us. How can I accept your money?

92
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,035
It's our duty. Don't mention it.

93
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,115
I won't take it any way.

94
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,194
Then you buy a new net for me. Is it enough?

95
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,995
Enough!

96
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,157
Don't tell anyone about last night. Or
the pirates will never take the bait again.

97
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,195
I know.

98
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,233
Let's go.

99
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,995
Kejian.

100
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,077
You go set up a tent by the bay.

101
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,076
You go wait for them by the
shore with your guys.

102
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,031
Watch over there.

103
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,996
Hello. Guests. Please have rest here.

104
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,075
The bun and tea are just ready now.

105
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,229
Let's have lunch.

106
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,195
Hot tea.

107
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,995
Would you like some wine?

108
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,991
No bother of price while you drink.

109
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,195
Taste it first.

110
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,036
My friend. Your accent doesn't sound local.

111
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,993
You have good ears. I'm from Northeast.
Had to come to make a living here.

112
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,075
Where are you two from?

113
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,115
Taichang.

114
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,036
How about that gentleman? Where is he from?

115
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,116
Hi. Boss. Did you ever hear of
Tonglong Currency Exchange?

116
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,153
Everywhere in China, Tonglong has a branch.

117
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,071
That gentleman is our young boss.

118
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,075
Is this wine OK?

119
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,195
Very good. One more bottle

120
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,115
Boss.

121
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,036
Gui. Come and have a drink

122
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,234
I am sure you'll be here.

123
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,155
Right here waiting for you.

124
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,195
Tie them up.

125
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,992
The three of us are so stupid to insult you.

126
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,075
Really, you're stupid.

127
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,233
Please spare us

128
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,033
Shut up! You tried to pierce us before. We
must have a good talk with your boss.

129
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,198
We're blind. I didn't know
that you're an expert

130
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,995
We're not the same as you.

131
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,036
Tell us where you're from. We'll repay you.

132
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,113
Mount Flying Tiger. Camp Flying Tiger, I'm
Yellow Flying Tiger. You heard of me?

133
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,035
No?

134
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,115
Sorry. No.

135
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,035
Now I see.

136
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,995
Stop joking.

137
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,118
Are you making fun of us? You
won't have made this trip in vain.

138
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,196
We put 20 taels of silver
under that big stone.

139
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,115
Please take it as present.

140
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,075
Do us a favor

141
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,155
Wait!

142
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,115
It's negotiable.

143
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,155
We'll act like we never met you before.

144
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,995
Get the money first.

145
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,155
All right

146
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,196
20 taels only?

147
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,035
We're very poor.

148
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,033
You have a profitable location.

149
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,109
Until now, I have had no
business in half a month

150
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,075
I don't think so.

151
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,235
A pharmacy owner was robbed
by you a couple days ago

152
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,998
Including merchandise and currency.
He lost over 5000 taels.

153
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,115
How do you know?

154
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,118
Unless we make everything clear,
we won't do business here.

155
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,158
Such a great amount of money.
We've sent it to the base already.

156
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,075
Base?

157
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,077
In that case. You guys have a boss.

158
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,118
Poorly skilled men like us, how can
we rob on our own?

159
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,235
Then tell us who is your boss.

160
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,116
Bodojin. Xudong. And Caimen.

161
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,035
Don't joke.

162
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,035
My boss...

163
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,035
Retreat!

164
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,191
Run.

165
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,995
Get him

166
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,035
Three died.

167
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,195
Investigate him.

168
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,155
You and I will visit the commander

169
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,195
Yu Dayou's waiting for your order, Governor.

170
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,195
Take it easy.

171
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,155
I've been waiting for you for over a month.

172
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,237
Since I received your instructions, I did it
my way instantly. But I got distracted.

173
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,116
It's all right

174
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,031
Is this Tang the?

175
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,075
Tang is awaiting your order, Governor.

176
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,195
Take it easy.

177
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,073
Dayou. This is General Zou You both
should co-operate well from now on.

178
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,195
General.

179
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,234
I heard that you're a good talent.

180
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,036
You... please give me a hand.

181
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,996
I have a lot to learn from general.

182
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,115
This way. Please.

183
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,109
Guardian Yu.

184
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,195
Nice to meet you.

185
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,993
I heard Prosecutor Lin is good at
investigations. I might enlist you one day.

186
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,195
I'm flattered.

187
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,237
Anytime. I am glad to work with you.

188
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,031
It's too early to say

189
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,996
Dayou. Kejian. You listen.

190
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,192
The Creed says: Yu Dayou is assigned to
Special Commander of Defending Pirate.

191
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,033
Tang Kejian assigned to Duty Captain.

192
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,995
Both under command of Governor
of Zejiang. Zu Zhe

193
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,155
Dayou.

194
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,113
Could you let me know how
soon you can clear this area?

195
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,234
I can't tell you now.

196
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,072
At least. You must restore the transmitter.

197
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,035
It's useless with merely
the transmitter ready.

198
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,116
We must find the base of the pirates first

199
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,158
But Chief of South Clan, its urgent
that you go to the Capital

200
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,158
For his safety. He'd better
wait a few days

201
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,155
Captain Tang

202
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,995
What do you think?

203
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,197
Governor. The most important point is
we can't send an army after the pirates.

204
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,198
If we alarm them, it might mean
withdrawal. Then it's a real headache.

205
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,195
Dayou. Your opinion?

206
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,995
Kejian is right.

207
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,153
Governor please prohibit General
Zou for taking any ruthless actions

208
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,038
and keep my new assignment a secret.

209
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,116
Beware of spies.

210
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,155
My guys will disguise as business men.
And wait for the pirates on the shore

211
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,075
Hey. What's wrong?

212
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,076
I don't know. We're stuck here.

213
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,075
Don't worry. Let me see.

214
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,235
Looks like heat stroke.
I will get some water.

215
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,996
Who is your boss? Talk!

216
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,035
Don't beat him.

217
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,038
Brother. What scope is that?
Let me take a look

218
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,155
Captured two more.

219
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,075
Hand these two over to you.

220
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,075
Any information

221
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,233
He's mute.

222
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,035
Mute?

223
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,075
Wang.

224
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,035
Take off his shoes.

225
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,995
Japanese.

226
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,995
Ask him in Japanese

227
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,075
How?

228
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,075
Says nothing.

229
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,229
You didn't kill him, did you?

230
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,149
Mr. Wu don't allow me to torture him.

231
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,995
Mr. Wu is right. Only if toughness
doesn't work out.

232
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,229
Sir. I understand.

233
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,158
Boss. You are always nice but I'm afraid
good words wont lead us to their base.

234
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,118
Why not lead them to us?

235
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,997
I don't know how.

236
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,195
I have an idea

237
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,035
Wang.

238
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,035
Boss.

239
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,193
You see.

240
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,115
Wine.

241
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,116
Our boss is planning a big
business deal,

242
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,996
worth of 100.000 taels at least.

243
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,035
So much.

244
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,195
I don't know.

245
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,115
I tell you.

246
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:36,036
I heard those are treasures from abroad.
A pearl there is as big as a ducks egg.

247
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,115
This big?

248
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,075
Where will we get them?

249
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,235
You get them. Then I will escort
them to the Capital.

250
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,075
Return it to the government?

251
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,075
Yes.

252
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,235
How can someone chose us to escort?

253
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,998
Do you know if you're boss made
a deal with the government?

254
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,195
This business is not easy.

255
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,035
Why?

256
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,035
Traffic is blocked.

257
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,075
We won't take the regular road.

258
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,193
Which way?

259
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,995
White Tree Mud.

260
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,035
When will we leave?

261
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,075
Tomorrow morning.

262
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,996
We can make money out of it?

263
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,075
Of course.

264
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,150
Then you can return the 50 taels you owe me.

265
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,233
Why do you keep on mentioning it?

266
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,071
I don't mean too but it's
about your credit.

267
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,156
You're so narrow-minded. I have good credit.

268
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,997
How can you be so rude to your creditor?

269
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,035
Watch your mouth.

270
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,075
You need to be taught a lesson.

271
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,193
What do you want?

272
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,195
Shameless.

273
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,995
You hit me.

274
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,995
You hit me first.

275
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,195
Stop.

276
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,075
What are you doing?

277
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,195
He owes me money and then hits me.

278
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,035
You're not kids. Shame on you.

279
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,195
All right.

280
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,233
Wang.

281
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,115
You go to the city and receive
the merchandise with me

282
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,155
Dayou's plan sounds like a child's trick.

283
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,189
In battle, the trickier the better.

284
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,155
Dayou.

285
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,195
You think...

286
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,078
They will step into your trap?

287
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,991
Not 100% sure.

288
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,115
Then take the chance.

289
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,239
Can you escort him to the border?
It is urgent to get him to the Capital

290
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,195
Waiting a few days longer will be good idea.

291
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,112
We don't have to bother Dayou.
We can escort him.

292
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,109
Dayou. What do you think?

293
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:00,075
I'd figure out the pirate's plan
before General Zou.

294
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,118
I have my own schedule.

295
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,109
You worry too much.

296
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,150
Dayou. Anything else?

297
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,191
I need more hands in the delivery.

298
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,195
Here they come.

299
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,149
Sit down and relax.

300
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,076
Teach me Bare-hands Vs. Blade Skill.

301
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,115
Get a blade.

302
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,195
Once again.

303
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,075
You got it?

304
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,995
Keep practicing.

305
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,156
Mr. Wu. You're good.

306
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,155
Not much.

307
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,037
I guess those Japanese nips
won't come today.

308
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,115
They will for sure.

309
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,991
They're coming. Get the package ready.

310
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,111
Follow me.

311
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,193
Mr. Wu. Take a look.

312
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,155
Could you recognize who
is in that over there?

313
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,115
It's General Zou.

314
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,075
Too bad.

315
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,155
It's him. Go!

316
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,069
General. Why are you here?

317
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,036
I have come here to see you.
How can I be ambushed?

318
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,196
General you're important.
Why risk your life?

319
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,117
Being a general shouldn't
mean avoiding danger.

320
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:37,075
Don't you know? I let those pirates go
in purpose. But you messed up my plan...

321
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,156
Don't worry. I won't steal credit from you.

322
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,116
You missed the point.

323
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,992
Brother Wu. How is the situation?

324
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,077
I chased them. But when that
general arrived, things turned messy.

325
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,035
Shut up.

326
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,115
General.

327
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,156
Your subordinates are too much

328
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,078
Mr. Wu is a friend who came to help
us. Not to work in the government.

329
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,075
Identify him!

330
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,069
A normal person.

331
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,195
Open it.

332
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,995
Boss, take a look.

333
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,195
Just open it.

334
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,020
I guess they won't take the bait any more.

335
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,110
Boss. My trick will work for sure

336
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,229
The Japanese are cunning

337
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,035
Kejian

338
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,236
If you were one of them, what
would be your next move?

339
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,033
I'll hide for several days or longer,
until I get a clear image in my mind.

340
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,115
And you?

341
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,238
I'll immediately send some
assassins to the opposite leaders.

342
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,195
You're both right. We'll find
out tomorrow morning

343
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,116
What happened?

344
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,195
Don't waste time.

345
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,195
Go to the side of the bay
and approach them

346
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,037
Brother. You hide in the trees.

347
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,156
Wang. You come with me to the hills.

348
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,191
I bet those Japanese won't come out so soon.

349
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,235
Do you agree?

350
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:26,075
Commander said you're the
No. 1 swordsman in North.

351
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,196
Same in the South.

352
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,234
Your commander is kidding.

353
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,996
Uncle. Is "Wind Blow" your nickname?

354
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,035
That's not right?

355
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,235
They say your opponents always fall down
without seeing you pull your blade out.

356
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,075
You must be dreaming.

357
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,076
Uncle Wu. Please teach me.

358
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,073
I'm not greedy. Too beat
Japanese is what I want.

359
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,995
All right.

360
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,115
You promise?

361
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,115
Learn to control your breathing first.

362
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,996
Good. Breath control how?

363
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,237
When I say freeze, you must hold
your breath and freeze instantly

364
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,077
No matter what you see or hear,
you cannot move.

365
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:22,995
Well...

366
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,075
So...

367
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,075
Uncle...

368
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,195
Freeze.

369
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,115
It's ok now.

370
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,155
What a guy.

371
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,036
Am I studying this skill?

372
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,195
Take your time.

373
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,237
Look at the yellow big island over there.

374
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,235
Cliffs on 3 sides. The rest unknown.

375
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,234
It's not an island. Some parts are
connected to the Mainland.

376
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,115
Follow me.

377
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,115
Commander.

378
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,115
Li.

379
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,195
Li.

380
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,195
Take it easy.

381
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,193
What's wrong?

382
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,996
The Japanese robbed our village.

383
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,035
When?

384
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,155
Early this morning.

385
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,195
Wang. Summon the others.

386
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,036
Try and find some survivors.

387
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,115
Dayou.

388
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,115
Check this.

389
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:55,995
There are more over there.

390
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,075
Brother.

391
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,115
Commander.

392
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,075
What?

393
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,037
I remember. Lin visited here today.

394
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,035
Who?

395
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,036
Prosecutor Lin.

396
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,115
Lin?

397
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,076
Prosecutor Lin in the Government?

398
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,155
Right.

399
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,995
Then what happened?

400
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,076
After the pirates finished
robbing, Lin appeared

401
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:59,194
He whispered to the pirate leader. They
withdrew. No time for the treasure.

402
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,195
Did you look good?

403
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,117
No mistake. I looked from when
I was hiding in the tree.

404
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,195
Tell them to go back. I'll go to see
the Governor. You wait for me here.

405
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,195
Lin?

406
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,152
Damn it! He's left with General
Zou this morning.

407
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,035
Where are they going?

408
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,075
Escorting the Chief to the Capital.

409
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,109
Didn't I request a few more days delay?

410
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,196
The chief does not want to wait.
Zou said he guarantees his safety.

411
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,155
Which way were they going?

412
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,072
Probably the main road. I'll send
some people to arrest Lin right away.

413
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:37,035
Please don't. Wait till he
reaches the Pirates base.

414
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,075
He may escape.

415
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,155
He may not.

416
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,150
Sir. General Zou is in trouble.

417
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,155
Waiting to see you in the parlour.

418
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,194
Governor. I accept any punishment.

419
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,115
Stand up.

420
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,234
Prosecutor Lin. Where is chief?

421
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,115
He...

422
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,196
Sir. Let Lin arrange the funeral first.

423
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,195
Prosecutor Lin.

424
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,036
I'll write to the Emperor and
will take responsibility.

425
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,075
You can't get away of this either.

426
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,995
You're not on duty. From now on you
wait for my instructions.

427
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,155
Get back.

428
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,075
Who is this one?

429
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,234
He's my assistant Lin Tong.

430
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:55,035
Here is the highest classified place.
How can you bring your assistant here?

431
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:01,035
It's my fault. My feet were hurting
so it was inconvenient to walk.

432
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,075
Be careful next time.

433
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,195
Prosecutor Lin.

434
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,988
Where was your assistant this morning?

435
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:12,995
In his home.

436
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,235
Let me explain. I was supposed to
go with Prosecutor Lin

437
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,993
but I suddenly suffered a
bellyache. So I missed it.

438
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,155
I didn't ask you.

439
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,235
It's true. Just like what he said.

440
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,235
That's all. Thanks for answering.

441
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,117
Quick.

442
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,115
Kill him.

443
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,078
Hero. Don't get me wrong.
I am your friend.

444
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,195
Who is your friend?

445
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,075
Enh...

446
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,993
Either a pirate or bandit. Either
government or not. I have a lot of friends.

447
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,038
Just identify yourself and
I'll give you a share.

448
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,076
You're Prosecutor Lin's assistant
but I don't buy it.

449
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,033
My position in the Government is
a fake. Actively I work all over.

450
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,115
No more. This is ridiculous.

451
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,198
You go back and tell Prosecutor Lin. He
must show himself tomorrow morning.

452
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,998
Otherwise. I will put his
assistant on his trail.

453
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,115
Go quickly.

454
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,075
Stop

455
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,071
Tell Lin to come here alone.

456
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,035
Alone.

457
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,195
No tricks.

458
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,035
He won't.

459
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,035
Li's Temple.

460
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,075
Prosecutor Lin.

461
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,195
Who are you?

462
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,035
You have nothing to say?

463
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,195
Could you tell me your name?

464
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,035
Have you heard of "Wind Blow"?

465
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,118
"Wind Blow"? Are you from Northeast?

466
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,115
Good memory.

467
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,034
Yes. You're so very famous.

468
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,198
I was a famous thief there.
And you're an officer there too.

469
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,196
Just a small potato. Unworthy to mention it.

470
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,235
Could you please tell me your real name?

471
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,075
Wu Jiyuan.

472
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,992
Right! Wu Jiyuan. Now I remember.

473
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:23,075
All right. Brother Wu. How much do you want?

474
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,115
It's not about the money.

475
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:30,995
I see.

476
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,235
You should have heard about
the kind of person I am.

477
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:42,194
No matter who you are or where you're from.
Show me respect, then I'll be friendly.

478
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,235
You have many friends.
That's why I looked for you.

479
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,237
If you need my help in any way, please
don't hesitate to give a shout.

480
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,233
Could you introduce me to Bodojin?

481
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,155
Who?

482
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,988
Bodojin. The Japanese in
the Double Fish Island.

483
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,117
Brother Wu. Are you joking?

484
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:16,028
I am a prosecutor. Now you ask
me to bring you to pirates.

485
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:20,233
Do I look like I am joking?

486
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,998
If you do as I say, I will repay you.

487
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,113
Or I'll send Lin Tong on the trail.

488
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,078
Brother Wu. You're not pushing me too far.

489
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,075
Forget it.

490
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:46,238
Brother Wu. Even if you send him to
trail me, he may tell you nothing at all.

491
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,035
I am a prosecutor any way.

492
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:54,034
I will tell you something. I'm the
same as you. I am a double-spy.

493
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,151
I work for Yu Dayou.

494
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,198
Not such a high rank. But I can put
an order on the government

495
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,075
You have good prospects then.

496
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,158
Good but not profitable. Well, so long.

497
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,193
Wait. Wait a minute

498
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,115
I may help you to locate Bodojin.
You should hand Lin Tong to me first.

499
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,118
Don't play games. You must do this first.

500
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,118
In this case. Will you break
ties to Yu Dayou?

501
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:35,993
Bodojin accepts me. I will break ties.

502
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,229
All right. Let's make a deal.

503
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,149
Good. You wait here.

504
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,195
Master.

505
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,195
Take it back.

506
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,071
When will you bring me there?

507
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,035
Anytime.

508
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:05,995
The sooner the better

509
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,155
How about now?

510
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,035
Now?

511
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,193
Look

512
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,195
Prosecutor Lin.

513
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:28,035
Don't you want to see Bodojin?
This is his number one aid.

514
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,116
Lin. You're so dirty.

515
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,196
You know too much about me.

516
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,195
Get him.

517
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,155
Shoot him.

518
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:49,995
Prosecutor Lin.

519
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:51,995
Brother Wu.

520
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,072
No more surprises from now on.

521
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,195
How can I contact Bodojin?

522
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,196
West coastal. Lin Tong will lead you there.

523
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,195
Ok. You can leave now.

524
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,193
Here it is.

525
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,155
What a fine place.

526
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,075
Please

527
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,035
Wait a minute.

528
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:16,995
This way.

529
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:40,035
Please have a seat.

530
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,195
Please stand up.

531
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,115
Sit. Sit...

532
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:29,995
Please sit down.

533
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:36,115
He is the Island Owner.

534
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,115
How are you?

535
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:50,113
Mr. And Mrs. Wu. I heard
you two would join us

536
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,195
Owner.

537
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:59,038
I heard you two are really experts.

538
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,158
Some of us have learnt enough.

539
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,196
Played some kung fu before.

540
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,235
Could you please demonstrate
some kung fu in front of us?

541
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,035
Sorry I am shy to show off myself.

542
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:20,113
2nd Brother. Who do you think
should play with Mr. Wu?

543
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,155
Gu.

544
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,195
Right.

545
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,234
Mr. Wu. Please teach me.

546
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,196
OK. Don't take it serious.

547
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:39,155
Up to you.

548
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,189
Stop.

549
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,115
You sit down.

550
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,155
Right.

551
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,035
Why?

552
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,115
Your back.

553
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:48,155
Yu and brothers. You all need
to learn from Mr. Wu.

554
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:04,033
Mr. And Mrs. Wu. We brothers
like to learn from you.

555
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:08,076
It's unnecessary. I'll take you all.

556
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,194
Stop. Stop...

557
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,195
What are you doing?

558
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,156
Say thanks to Mr. Wu for his kindness.

559
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,115
Check your wrist.

560
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,996
You can't use your right hand now.

561
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,155
It'll be ok in a couple of days.

562
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:24,233
Get back

563
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:39,078
Mr. Wu's kung fu is so impressive.

564
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,195
I am flattered.

565
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,113
Monk. Would you like to
try Mr. Wu's archery skill?

566
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:58,993
Mr. Wu. Would you like to spar with me?

567
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:03,078
I'm not good. Maybe she could
learn something from you.

568
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:05,995
All right.

569
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,235
Madam. Please teach me.

570
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,075
My bow.

571
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,155
Please.

572
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,234
OK. I'll spar first.

573
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,155
How do you like it?

574
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:05,995
Wonderful.

575
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:08,035
You try.

576
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:44,115
Wonderful.

577
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:53,115
I admire you.

578
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:00,149
Owner. I think...

579
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:01,995
Hold.

580
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,235
Brother. You might spar with
the blade with Mr. Wu.

581
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:20,037
Mr. Wu. Please teach me.

582
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:21,195
Learn from each other.

583
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,155
Please.

584
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:28,233
Don't take it too serious also.

585
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,155
Up to you.

586
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:37,193
Now I'll start.

587
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,115
Stop. Stop...

588
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,996
Mr. Wu's blade is invincible.

589
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,155
I am flattered.

590
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:20,195
Please excuse me.

591
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,035
I am lucky.

592
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:24,995
Please have a seat.

593
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:30,115
Your back was cut.

594
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,155
Mr. And Mrs. Wu.

595
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:46,232
After watching the match, I
think you're the ones we need.

596
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,035
Not yet.

597
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:52,995
I'll try him.

598
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:57,038
Mr. Wu. This Japanese friend
wants to learn from you.

599
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:59,037
Tell him it's unnecessary.

600
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:03,196
Mr. Wu says no.

601
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,115
Nonsense

602
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:11,076
Mr. Wu. Please play with him.

603
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,998
He's an expert of the blade. You be careful.

604
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:17,238
Don't worry.

605
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:19,995
You come here.

606
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,150
Don't be afraid. Take it.

607
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,195
Mr. Wu.

608
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,035
Go.

609
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:19,232
Mr. Wu. You're as great as I heard.
We can't afford losing you.

610
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,234
We're just a small group here.

611
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:25,996
Nevertheless. We have our rule.

612
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,190
Temporarily. You are a captain
under the 2nd Brother's command.

613
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:35,118
After you'll get some credentials,
you'll get a raise.

614
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:39,118
About the regulations here,
2nd Brother will tell you later.

615
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:42,035
Thank you, Island Owner.

616
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:45,073
Since I am here, position
doesn't matter much.

617
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:52,156
After all the sparring, I prefer
being a guest here.

618
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:54,115
I don't understand what you mean.

619
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:59,997
I am not ready to join you yet. Taking my
share in each business will be good.

620
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:02,116
But Mr. Wu. It's against our regulation.

621
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:05,198
What a pity. Good bye.

622
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,195
Wait.

623
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:11,118
Mr. Wu. Every visitor here

624
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:17,155
is not to come or leave. Only if it is his
wish. I sincerely invited you to join us.

625
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,156
2nd Brother. Persuade Mr. Wu for me please.

626
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,155
Mr. Wu.

627
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:38,155
Excuse us.

628
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:40,035
Hold on please.

629
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:41,995
Mr. Wu. The Island Owner never
takes his words back.

630
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:44,233
Same as I.

631
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:00,035
What is this?

632
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,031
Be quiet and sit down.

633
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,155
Open the door.

634
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,993
I am sorry. Please sit.

635
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,195
I am Bodojin.

636
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,195
It's my pleasure to meet you.

637
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:12,035
Your suggestion right before is acceptable.
I'll take it

638
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:17,035
By the way. Since you're to be with
us, your heart should be steady.

639
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,195
It will.

640
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:22,078
Good. You must provide a deposit.

641
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,035
No problem. Speak out.

642
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:29,993
I want Yu Dayou. Dead or alive.

643
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:33,196
How soon will your good news come?

644
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:38,198
In 3 days. Have someone sent for me.

645
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:30,195
Has he left?

646
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:33,155
Did you see it with your eyes?

647
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:36,038
Yes. All killed. None survived.

648
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,031
Did you see it well?

649
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:41,116
Good. Welcome him back tomorrow.

650
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:46,073
This guy is untrustworthy.
Let's set a trap for him.

651
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:26,035
Wait here.

652
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,195
Retreat.

653
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,035
Ambush.

654
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:23,195
They're coming.

655
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,155
Look at that.

656
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:09,076
Yu Dayou gathered all his force.

657
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:12,071
I think we should go back.

658
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:15,075
No.

659
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,032
They already know where we live.
We can't go back now.

660
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,036
Let's flee. Find another hiding place.

661
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:25,999
Wu knows we're here. We can't flee.

662
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:28,996
We should divide into three groups and
switch tactics when their backs are turned.

663
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:33,078
What is this trick called in Chinese?

664
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,075
Sneak Attack

665
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,155
Right.

666
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:47,235
Commander. I think we can't
stay here. How about...

667
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:49,075
Be patient.

668
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,115
Commander.

669
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,115
General.

670
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:04,116
Ridiculous. Never think of
a battle in this way.

671
01:24:05,160 --> 01:24:06,115
I go to watch now.

672
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:04,115
Strange.

673
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,193
They're ambushed.

674
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,035
Let's retreat.

675
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:10,151
No. Go.

676
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,075
Charge.

677
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,997
Look.

678
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:04,075
Go.

679
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:39,195
Wait. Wait...

680
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,195
We fell in the trap.

681
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:17,035
Retreat.

682
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:18,115
We can't.

683
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,115
We must fight our way out.

684
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,156
Go and bring Bodojin here quickly.

685
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:40,115
Seems they're fleeing.

686
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:47,234
I will go and get Bodojin. This one I
leave to you. He is very good at kicking.

687
01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:50,036
You should try your best to hold his ankle.

688
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:30,035
Shaotang.

689
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:56,193
Shaotang.

690
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:17,115
Get back here.

691
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:49,116
Wang. Watch the arrow.

692
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:08,035
Brother.

693
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:11,075
Brother.

694
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:25,195
Untie me quickly.

695
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:32,038
Bodojin run away now with the treasure.

696
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,076
When I got close, they
shot me with an arrow.

697
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:37,075
How can I

698
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:38,229
possibly board the secret port?

699
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:43,195
Shameless.

700
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:56,195
Xudong.

701
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:02,075
If you surrender now, I'll appeal
to Governor to spare you.

702
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:08,993
You would redeem yourself, if you
help us to capture Bodojin.

703
01:35:10,200 --> 01:35:12,156
I'll recommend you a position in government.

704
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:20,155
What do you think?

705
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:33,993
Good. Tell me where he is now.

706
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:39,075
I am afraid it's too late.

707
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:42,155
Take cover.

708
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:33,988
Although in this victory, a gang of
pirates were annihilated.

709
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:37,036
Zejing Governor. Zu Zhe.

710
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:41,995
For unwilling to bribe his superior,
he Committed suicide.

711
01:41:43,080 --> 01:41:44,195
Yu Dayou got demoted.

712
01:41:45,240 --> 01:41:51,076
Nor was the Japanese pirates tamed
up till the end of the Ming dynasty.
