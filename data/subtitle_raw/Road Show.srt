1
00:01:23,228 --> 00:01:24,228
- Thank you.

2
00:01:25,273 --> 00:01:26,440
How do you do?

3
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:31,470
How do you do?

4
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,370
- I never thought that
I'd live to see the day

5
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,980
that a girl could get Drogo Gaines,

6
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,400
with all his millions, to the altar.

7
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,550
- My Helen has done it.

8
00:01:39,384 --> 00:01:40,900
- I'll believe it when I see it.

9
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,660
- My Helen is a very smart girl.

10
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,030
- My Agnes was in the running,
but what chance did she have,

11
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,320
when he never kept her out
after 10 o'clock at night.

12
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,279
- Well.

13
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:25,742
- Psst.

14
00:02:35,862 --> 00:02:36,740
- What's the matter?

15
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,713
- Well come and see.

16
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,753
Look.

17
00:02:42,753 --> 00:02:44,460
- Young man, what is all this nonsense?

18
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,690
Goodness, you better get a doctor quick.

19
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,240
- Yes, yes, of course.

20
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,030
Dr. Johnson, will you come in please?

21
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,416
- Yes, certainly, excuse me a minute.

22
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,249
- Listen to me, Drogo Gaines,

23
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:03,620
what do you think you're doing?

24
00:03:06,837 --> 00:03:07,956
What's the matter with him?

25
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:09,500
- I think he's nuts.

26
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,310
- Here he is, Doctor.

27
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,130
- My goodness, we'd better
put him on the couch.

28
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:14,963
- All right.

29
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:17,223
- Lend me a hand.
- Okay, here we go.

30
00:03:25,384 --> 00:03:28,350
- There appears to be no
fever, and the pulse is normal.

31
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,280
It must be a mental collapse.

32
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,830
I'll phone for some assistance.

33
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,773
- Hey, Drogo, come on,
wake up outta this thing.

34
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,853
- Well, what now?

35
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:40,730
- Well of all things to happen to me.

36
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,740
- Yeah, happen to you.

37
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,350
If you had married the dope two weeks ago,

38
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,290
we'd have had the 10 million

39
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,390
and we wouldn't care
whether he did go goofy.

40
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,940
- Ma, it's all your fault.

41
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,730
If you'd only let me
marry Jerry Vassleven.

42
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,462
He had plenty of dough,

43
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:52,430
and besides I might have
learned to love him.

44
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,263
- How did I know?

45
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:55,350
Look at all the money Drogo's got.

46
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,510
What are we gonna do?

47
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,560
We can't let those people
eat all that food and stuff.

48
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,870
Who's gonna pay for it?

49
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,650
You go out there and tell
them it's been postponed.

50
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,483
- All right.

51
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,790
- Are you all right?

52
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,700
- Oh yes, I'm all right.

53
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,650
- You mean to say that you
heard everything we said?

54
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,440
- Yes, but I didn't do
this for that reason.

55
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,500
I was afraid to go out there.

56
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,117
I realized what a momentous
step I was taking.

57
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:24,780
But now that I know where
your affections really are,

58
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,380
it's probably all for the best.

59
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,133
- All for the best, your
making a monkey outta me,

60
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:30,298
leaving me at the altar?

61
00:04:30,298 --> 00:04:31,148
- I'm very sorry.

62
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,530
- Wait a minute.

63
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,570
Everybody in this house
thinks you're crazy.

64
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,930
Now listen to me, Drogo Gaines,
you're going to marry me

65
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:39,180
or they're going to think you're crazy

66
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,790
for the rest of your life.

67
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:41,740
- Oh, I don't understand, Helen,

68
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,262
how are you going to
influence those people--

69
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:48,328
- Let me go, let me go, let me go!

70
00:04:48,328 --> 00:04:51,505
- Help, help, what are you doing?

71
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:54,840
- Mother, somebody get him, he's crazy!

72
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,403
Help, help!

73
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:58,653
Help me, he's gone violent.

74
00:04:59,852 --> 00:05:00,685
Help!

75
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:01,723
- What's the matter, dear?

76
00:05:01,723 --> 00:05:03,758
- My poor child.

77
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:17,432
- Good morning, Mr. G.

78
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,353
- Would you mind telling me where I am?

79
00:05:22,353 --> 00:05:23,956
- The Hopedale Club.

80
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,946
- Hopedale Club?

81
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,930
I can't stay in a place like this.

82
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,840
- I'm sorry, Mr. G, I'll have to refer

83
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,650
your complaint to Dr. Thorndike.

84
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,800
Now eat your breakfast like a good boy.

85
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,490
- I don't want any breakfast.

86
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,940
- Please, Mr. G, you mustn't.

87
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:49,046
- Dr. Thorndike?

88
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,640
- Oh, pardon me, have you the time?

89
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,090
- I'm sorry, I haven't a watch.

90
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,213
- Here, take mine.

91
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:05,303
- But listen, I--

92
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,384
I wanna see Dr. Thorndike.

93
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:18,866
- Just have a seat.

94
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,838
- Okay, you're progressing splendidly.

95
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:45,710
Now drop in and see me anytime you like.

96
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,528
We're always glad to have you.

97
00:06:47,528 --> 00:06:49,941
- Thank you, Doctor, thank you.

98
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,670
- Mr. N, do you mind if I
send Mr. G in ahead of you?

99
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,374
Not at all.

100
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,040
- Well, well, Mr. Gaines,
glad you dropped in.

101
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,633
We'll call you Mr. G here.

102
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,330
Are you feeling better?

103
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,430
- No I'm not.

104
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,780
I mean, I never felt bad.

105
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,330
- Now don't excite yourself.

106
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,510
- I'm not exciting myself, I
just wanna get out of here.

107
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,720
- Of course, they all do at first,

108
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,140
but you will soon learn to like us.

109
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,700
We like you.

110
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,000
- That's just dandy, Doc.

111
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,670
And I'm sure that you
and I and all the lads

112
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,160
would be come great chums,

113
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,250
but really, I've got to
get back to New York.

114
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,683
- What have you there, Mr. G?

115
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:40,516
- Oh that?

116
00:07:41,623 --> 00:07:44,840
A man outside fastened a
flower that he didn't have

117
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,980
with a pin that isn't here.

118
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,146
- Would you mind letting
me have that again, please?

119
00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:53,790
- Well that is, he thought he had a pin

120
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,613
that he put in a flower
that I haven't got.

121
00:07:57,869 --> 00:07:59,130
Now look, I was just--

122
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,250
- I understand perfectly.

123
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,624
- Wait a minute.

124
00:08:02,624 --> 00:08:04,520
A fellow simply gave me a flower.

125
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,607
- And a very pretty flower it is, too.

126
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:08,910
- Oh.

127
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,101
Look, Doctor, there's
nothing wrong with me.

128
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:22,552
- Of course there's nothing
wrong with you, Mr. G.

129
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:23,385
- Now, Doctor.

130
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,003
- Ooh.

131
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,020
Cute.

132
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,530
- Listen, Dr. Thorndike, I've had enough

133
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,043
of this foolishness,
you've got to let me go.

134
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,860
- Mr. Gaines, I hope you'll appreciate

135
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,030
my position in this matter.

136
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,810
I have no alternative but to keep you here

137
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,603
until your conduct improves.

138
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:51,436
- But listen.

139
00:08:51,436 --> 00:08:52,269
- Now don't make it hard for yourself.

140
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:55,300
Finish dressing and go out in the sun.

141
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,873
We're allowing you the
full run of the grounds.

142
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:04,763
- Ah ah, ah ah.

143
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,971
- Oh I'm sorry, I didn't
know you were fishing.

144
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:31,443
- What did you think I was doing?

145
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,913
- Good fishing?

146
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,733
- Excellent.

147
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:42,323
- Caught many?

148
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:44,053
- Nope, never catch any.

149
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:48,199
- It's a sort of new idea
when it comes to fishing.

150
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,966
- Yes, you're brighter than I
thought you were, Mr. Gaines.

151
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:52,799
Sit down.

152
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,632
- Oh, you know me?

153
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,420
- Know all about you.

154
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,703
Carroway's my name,
Colonel Carleton Carroway.

155
00:09:58,703 --> 00:10:00,060
You've heard of Carroway Seeds.

156
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,434
Well, I'm the whole corporation.

157
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:03,267
I didn't like the business,

158
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:05,100
so I came here on my own accord.

159
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,297
I like it here.

160
00:10:06,297 --> 00:10:07,872
- I don't.

161
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:08,889
I'm going to escape.

162
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:10,110
- Oh not you're not.

163
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,570
The walls are too high.

164
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,970
Why'd you come here if
you don't wanna stay?

165
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,680
- I didn't come.

166
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,670
I pulled a little stunt in self-defense.

167
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,520
- Oh yes, that Newton girl.

168
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,440
While you were looking at her eyes,

169
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,530
she was looking at your checkbook.

170
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,600
- Well I didn't know.

171
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,963
And Agnes, she kissed you
when you bought her a yacht.

172
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,480
You'd have done better with a canoe.

173
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,520
And that Argentine
tomato, what was her name?

174
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,390
- Conchita Montezuma.

175
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,930
- You bought her bracelets
and called her angel.

176
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,557
And she said.

177
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,780
Sounded sweet, didn't it?

178
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,743
Just means sucker.

179
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,440
- You certainly know a lot.

180
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,863
- Yes, that's why I'm here.

181
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,323
- Tell me, Colonel.

182
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,333
How does a fellow know when
he's found the right girl?

183
00:10:58,703 --> 00:10:59,980
- The signs.

184
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,458
- Signs?

185
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:02,390
- Yes.

186
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,717
- I don't understand.

187
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:06,050
- Now, supposing a girl, uh,

188
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,030
crossed her fingers,
and you crossed yours,

189
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,033
at the same time, that's a sign.

190
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,970
Oh, I've got it.

191
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:15,803
- What's the matter?

192
00:11:15,803 --> 00:11:16,713
- Oh, I've caught a fish.

193
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,490
Well I'll never be able
to fish here anymore.

194
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,440
Come on, young Drogo.

195
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,540
- What are you gonna do now?

196
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,547
- Gonna photograph the
fish, everybody does that.

197
00:11:24,547 --> 00:11:26,003
- Are you leaving, Colonel?

198
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:29,352
- Yes, this place is no
good, there's too many fish.

199
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,570
- Something I could do for you?

200
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,513
- No.

201
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,842
- Now this, Mr. G, is a Blooming Daisy.

202
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:43,675
- The what?

203
00:11:43,675 --> 00:11:45,510
The Blooming Daisy,
probably the finest camera

204
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,213
ever invented by the human mind.

205
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,290
Now, don't let her frighten you

206
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,070
and don't ask how she works
or you'll spoil all the fun.

207
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,690
Now, take one step forward.

208
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,523
Two backward.

209
00:11:57,412 --> 00:11:59,246
Just a mite forward.

210
00:11:59,246 --> 00:12:00,880
- Now what are you playing?

211
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,500
- That's another invention of mine.

212
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,080
I never focus the camera.

213
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,843
Anyone can focus the camera, I focus you.

214
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:08,541
Now, are you ready?

215
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,840
Hold it, there you are.

216
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,340
That merely takes the photograph.

217
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,654
And now, we develop it.

218
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:21,609
Come in.

219
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:25,260
- Morning, Colonel.

220
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,307
- Morning, Harry, meet Mr. G.

221
00:12:27,307 --> 00:12:28,561
- How do you do?

222
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:29,894
- How do you do?

223
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,053
- And now we shall see what we shall see.

224
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,390
We release the gadget here.

225
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:41,422
See what's in this thing.

226
00:12:41,422 --> 00:12:44,690
And at last, the photograph,
and there you are.

227
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,770
- It's blank.

228
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,790
- Yes, that's the wonderful
thing about the Blooming Daisy.

229
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,160
You never can tell what's coming out.

230
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,296
Sometimes I get the most amazing pictures,

231
00:12:53,296 --> 00:12:54,879
but not very often.

232
00:12:56,158 --> 00:12:57,610
- Uncle Carleton, you're
gonna stay with me

233
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,880
at the country place.

234
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,067
Dr. Thorndike and I think
you'll be much happier there.

235
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:02,780
- Oh, well, Harry, I like it here.

236
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,570
- I know, but you've got
to leave here sometime.

237
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,040
You've been here long enough.

238
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,840
People are starting to ask
embarrassing questions.

239
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,980
- Aw, Harry.

240
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,150
- Not another word, I
know what's best for you.

241
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,000
You get your things together,

242
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,829
and I'll call for you in
the morning, understand?

243
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:15,170
- Yes.

244
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,510
- Well, goodbye.

245
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,600
Goodbye, Mr., uh.

246
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,239
- G.
- G.

247
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:21,473
- I hope you have fun
playing with your fish.

248
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,610
- I'm embarrassing him, that crackpot.

249
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,000
- He seemed all right to me.

250
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,030
- Oh he did, did he?

251
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,863
Come here.

252
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,755
Look at that.

253
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,393
- What's the matter with that?

254
00:14:01,393 --> 00:14:02,720
He's a member of the fire department.

255
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,800
- That's just it, he isn't.

256
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,390
Well, most likely, the whole
thing's my fault anyway.

257
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,590
When he was a little lad, I bought him

258
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,325
a toy fire engine to play with,

259
00:14:10,325 --> 00:14:11,500
said he wanted to be a fireman.

260
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,333
He never outgrew it.

261
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,409
He's been playing fireman ever since.

262
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:15,890
- Oh.

263
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,350
- Go to his country place?

264
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,380
Why the whole thing's nothing
but a big fire department.

265
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,070
He'll not get me up there.

266
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,680
I'll run away.

267
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,070
That's what I'll do, I'll escape.

268
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,470
- You said you couldn't escape.

269
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:27,350
- No I didn't, I said you couldn't.

270
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,770
Didn't say I couldn't.

271
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,430
If I had enough money to
finance the Blooming Daisy,

272
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,430
I'd escape tonight.

273
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:34,038
- I have $120.

274
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:36,800
- $120, say, say, that's enough to put

275
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,350
the Blooming Daisy on a paying basis.

276
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,180
- The Blooming Daisy
won't even take a picture.

277
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,650
- Sh, you know that, and I know that,

278
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,287
but the people we
photograph wouldn't know it.

279
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:46,410
Now look, you meet me at
the woods near the river

280
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,740
at nine o'clock tonight.

281
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,220
Boy, we'll hit the open road.

282
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,350
We'll meet people, real people,

283
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,260
not the money-grabbing kind.

284
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,783
Don't forget to bring the money.

285
00:14:59,536 --> 00:15:00,369
- Yoo hoo.

286
00:15:02,273 --> 00:15:03,980
What kept you so long?

287
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,320
- The fool guard didn't show up in time.

288
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,830
Couldn't escape unless
the guard was there,

289
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,663
wouldn't be strategic.

290
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:09,680
Here, take that pole and
knock those rocks off.

291
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,485
The equipment's there.

292
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:12,318
- What for?

293
00:15:12,318 --> 00:15:14,390
- The boat of course,
we've gotta launch her.

294
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,850
I knew this life would
be too good to last,

295
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,670
so I plotted this escape years ago.

296
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,287
- You call this thing a boat?

297
00:15:19,287 --> 00:15:22,759
- Stop all that fiddle faddle
and get this stuff onboard.

298
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:23,926
There you are.

299
00:15:24,761 --> 00:15:25,594
Here.

300
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:28,354
Now, give me a hand.

301
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:30,850
All ashore that's going ashore!

302
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,230
- Sh.
- Sh.

303
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,080
- How far do you expect
to get in this thing?

304
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,140
- Who wants to get far?

305
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,816
We just wanna get.

306
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:38,741
Heave ho, hardy.

307
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:47,507
Low bridge.

308
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,720
- Have Mr. Gaines sent
to my office right away.

309
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,140
- Thank you, Dr. Thorndike.

310
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,127
As Mr. Gaines' secretary,
I can assure you,

311
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:00,470
there's absolutely nothing wrong with him.

312
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:03,301
- As his fiancee, I can
assure you that there is.

313
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:05,080
- This whole thing is preposterous.

314
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,847
I demand that he be released at once.

315
00:16:06,847 --> 00:16:08,100
- And I demand that he be kept here.

316
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,960
- Dr. Thorndike?
- Yes.

317
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,260
- Mr. Gaines has escaped.

318
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,093
- Escaped?
- Escaped?

319
00:16:12,093 --> 00:16:13,760
- Yes, and so has Colonel Carroway.

320
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,014
- This is terrible.

321
00:16:16,014 --> 00:16:16,847
- Hello, Miss White?

322
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:18,040
Miss White, notify the police.

323
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,440
Mr. Gaines and the Colonel have escaped.

324
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,420
- Fine night for sailing,
the sea's as smooth as glass.

325
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,700
- We're not at sea, we're
in the middle of the river.

326
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,580
And my feet are getting wet.

327
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,950
- Well a little saltwater
never hurt anybody.

328
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,530
- That's not saltwater.

329
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:31,630
- I never said it was.

330
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:34,010
I made a statement, and I'll stick by it.

331
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,340
A little saltwater never hurt anybody.

332
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,590
- Oh, you're impossible.

333
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,330
And this raft's impossible.

334
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,010
It's probably sinking.

335
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,960
It'd serve us right if we both drown.

336
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,690
I never should have listened
to you in the first place.

337
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,850
- Oh, playing the coward, eh?

338
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,570
Why, this silly river's so shallow

339
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,700
you could wade ashore at any time.

340
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,533
- It is?

341
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,720
I'm going to wade.

342
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,033
This must be the wrong river.

343
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,790
Silly old river's shallow, huh?

344
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,537
Well, you must
have hit an air pocket.

345
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,130
- What's that?

346
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,210
Waterfall.

347
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,330
- Waterfall?

348
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,316
Give me that thing or we'll go over.

349
00:17:16,316 --> 00:17:17,769
- That's a silly statement.

350
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:19,905
People don't go over falls in rafts.

351
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,331
They only go over in barrels.

352
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,164
- Oh stop that drivel and give me a hand!

353
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,346
- Well, that was a snappy halt.

354
00:17:38,346 --> 00:17:41,619
- Yeah, I nearly broke my neck.

355
00:17:47,372 --> 00:17:49,247
- Well, all's well that ends well.

356
00:17:49,247 --> 00:17:50,410
- Say, what's the idea of throwing things

357
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,030
and destroying people's property?

358
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,360
- I'll have you know, Madame,
that I have just perpetrated

359
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,770
the most magnificent escape in my long

360
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,673
and brilliant record of achievement.

361
00:17:58,673 --> 00:17:59,896
- Escape?

362
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:00,729
So that's it, eh?

363
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:02,610
I might have known.

364
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,918
- Now that you know, would you mind

365
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:05,210
telling me how to get to a telephone?

366
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,690
- Listen, you're not going anywhere

367
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,537
till you pay for what you broke.

368
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:10,798
And a case of Kewpie
dolls costs nine bucks.

369
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,470
- Well, here's $20, keep the change.

370
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,630
- I said nine bucks, no more and no less.

371
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:17,977
- That's the smallest I've got.

372
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:19,207
You mean you don't want the extra money?

373
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:20,180
- No, why should I?

374
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,580
- Oh what a girl.

375
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,400
- Come on, come on, pay up
or I'll call the police.

376
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,650
I have nothing smaller
than a 20.

377
00:18:29,297 --> 00:18:31,310
- Say, you're soaking wet.

378
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,410
- Sure, I've been wading.

379
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,830
- Here you are, my lad.

380
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,040
Change into something of mine.

381
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,530
I always carry extra equipment.

382
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,387
- Aw no, I'm all right.

383
00:18:37,387 --> 00:18:39,490
- Now go ahead, we can't
carry on with sick troops,

384
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,850
you know, you can change behind the car.

385
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,833
- Make it snappy.

386
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,970
Say, uh, what's he done?

387
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,600
- It isn't what he's done,
gal, it's what he might do.

388
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,603
His instincts, you know, are all bad.

389
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,460
He's been a terrible trial to me,

390
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,500
and I've done the best that I could.

391
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,200
If he but had the love of a good woman,

392
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,520
someone to bring out
the finer things in him,

393
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,690
to restore his self-respect,

394
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,627
then again he could
become a man among men.

395
00:19:22,102 --> 00:19:23,480
- Oh, ho!

396
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,720
Moore's Carnival.

397
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,490
- Yeah, Penguin Moore, that's me.

398
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:29,440
- You own this?

399
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,209
- Yeah, the whole works.

400
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:34,234
- Bright lights, music, the
gay, pleasure-mad throngs.

401
00:19:34,234 --> 00:19:35,425
- What throngs?

402
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,660
- Merely a figure of speech, my girl,

403
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,547
merely a figure of speech.

404
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,990
- Ladies and gentlemen,
right over this way.

405
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,850
- Come on, fellas.

406
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,040
Why hello, Penguin,
glad to see you're back.

407
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,460
- Hi, Alice.

408
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,350
You got change for a 20?

409
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,303
- Are they still making those things?

410
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:55,113

make you thin, come on.

to get the dollar portrait for 25 cents.

438
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,250
Right down that way, lady, to your left.

439
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,043
As soon as we get change for
the $20, we're on our way.

440
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,310
- Now listen, young lady,
I been waiting long enough.

441
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,560
Either you give me $120
or this show is attached.

442
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,560
- Now patience, Sheriff, patience.

443
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,740
I do not like to be
rushed while I am bathing.

444
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,740
In fact, I like to soak.

445
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,113
- After 47 minutes, you
oughta be waterlogged.

446
00:22:28,636 --> 00:22:31,300
Oh, you come right out
of there, young lady,

447
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,840
or I'm going to come over
there and pull you out.

448
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,103
- Why, Sheriff, please, after a--

449
00:22:43,348 --> 00:22:44,370
What's going on here?

450
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,478
- I was waiting for the head of this here

451
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:47,689
show to get out of the shower.

452
00:22:47,689 --> 00:22:49,132
- Well I'm the head of the show.

453
00:22:49,132 --> 00:22:50,140
- Oh, you are?

454
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,590
You blew Brownsville last
night owing money to several

455
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,180
citizens of our community
for use of the lot,

456
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,850
gas, electricity, water.

457
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,013
Matter of fact, you
didn't pay for nothing.

458
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,950
- Just a minute, Sheriff.

459
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,377
What is the attachment on this show?

460
00:23:03,377 --> 00:23:04,957
- $120.

461
00:23:04,957 --> 00:23:05,790
- $120.

462
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,640
Well there's your hundred,
and here's your 20,

463
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,510
now thank you very much, Sheriff.

464
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,510
That fixes up everything.

465
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,220
- Wait a minute, Mister.

466
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,320
I never ask anyone to pay
off anything on my show.

467
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,430
- Who said I was paying
off anything on the show?

468
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,720
I merely wanna buy the photographic

469
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,110
concession for the Colonel.

470
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:21,640
- You mean you wanna pay
120 bucks so the Colonel

471
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,690
can use that Blooming Daisy around here?

472
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,523
- That's right.

473
00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:26,650
- Well let me tell you,
Mister, it ain't worth it.

474
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,320
- It's worth a lot more than that to me.

475
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,873
Now goodbye, Miss Moore,
and thank you very much.

476
00:23:32,674 --> 00:23:34,523
- Say, not a bad guy.

477
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,389
And cute too.

478
00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:38,767
- Well, goodbye, Colonel.

479
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:40,100
And lots of luck with the Blooming Daisy.

480
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,933
- Where you going?

481
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:42,430
- Back to New York, of course.

482
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,030
- That's my suit you've got on.

483
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,950
- Oh, it is, well I'll
send it back to you.

484
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,360
- Which one of you is Penguin Moore?

485
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,230
- I am, why?

486
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,410
- Well, I'm Clem Prouty,
owner of this lot,

487
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,594
and I want that 20 bucks rent money

488
00:23:53,594 --> 00:23:55,060
in advance that you promised me.

489
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,030
- Well, say, can't you
give us a little while?

490
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,360
- Nothing doing, I'll
give you just 10 minutes

491
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,600
to get the money, and either
you put up or pack up.

492
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,200
And I'll be waiting right here.

493
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,350
- Wait a minute.

494
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,830
I'll get 20 bucks from
these yokels for my Indian

495
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,923
remedy if it's the last act of my life.

496
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,720
- Now where do you think you're going?

497
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,300
- Well with you, of course.

498
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,540
Nowhere else to go now that my source

499
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,100
of livelihood's been cut off.

500
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,360
What a pity.

501
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,380
And for the lack of only $20.

502
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,640
- I never saw such a mess.

503
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,707
There must be some way to make $20.

504
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,980
- Say, I've got another
attachment on the Blooming Daisy

505
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,008
that I saved for just such an emergency.

506
00:24:40,008 --> 00:24:42,593
Now you put one here,
one here and one here.

507
00:24:47,543 --> 00:24:49,063
- Well I'll try anything once.

508
00:24:52,465 --> 00:24:54,230
- Here you are, young lady,
take care of my bag for me.

509
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,063
- Sure, Bud.

510
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,140
- Beg your pardon, Stranger.

511
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,570
You look like an intelligent person,

512
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,220
one who'd be interested in
making a little easy money.

513
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,560
- Sure, who's gonna learn me?

514
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,850
- I am, but in order to
accomplish this feet, I shall have

515
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,290
to secure a portion of your chewing gum.

516
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,270
- What good's gum gonna do you?

517
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,983
- That's the secret, I've made
hundreds of dollars that way.

518
00:25:14,185 --> 00:25:16,840
Now, we attach the little
pea to the chewing gum,

519
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,553
we attach both to the
interior this shell, like so.

520
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:25,455
Follow me, Stranger, I'll
show you how it works.

521
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:29,850
Well, well, well, the shell game, eh?

522
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,410
The object of this game is to find out

523
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,290
which shell the little pea is under.

524
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,050
I've had a lot of
experience along that line.

525
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,772
Say, your shoelace is untied, young fella.

526
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,840
Tell you what I'll do, young man.

527
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,370
I'll bet you $20 that I can tell you

528
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,250
where the little pea is.

529
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,815
- I'll be you 20 too.

530
00:25:44,815 --> 00:25:46,470
- 20's all I want, 20's the limit.

531
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,540
- Wait a minute, take your
money back, it was my idea.

532
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,990
- Oh no you don't, I
had my money up first.

533
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,260
- You are unfair, sir, no good in fact.

534
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,158
- Just a minute, just a minute.

535
00:25:55,158 --> 00:25:56,970
Say, young fella, didn't I
have my money down first?

536
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,950
- Yes, I guess you did.

537
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,000
That gives you the first
chance to play, sorry, Mister.

538
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,320
- Why it's an outrage!

539
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,680
Money won that way'll do you no good.

540
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,164
- Now, gentlemen, which
shell hides the little pea?

541
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,642
- That one.
- That one.

542
00:26:08,642 --> 00:26:10,263
- It ain't there.
- No.

543
00:26:10,263 --> 00:26:12,250
- Too bad, gentlemen, too bad.

544
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,780
Better luck next time.

545
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,060
- It's amazing, the man must be a wizard.

546
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,260
I'm glad I didn't bet any of my own money.

547
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,000
- And there you are, ladies and gentlemen,

548
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,763
the great Indian Princess
Yo-Yo in the flesh.

549
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,100
She speaks not a word of
anything but her native tongue.

550
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,600
Now she brings this tonic to you

551
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,220
from the sands of the desert,

552
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,030
the rocks of the mountains,
the land of the mighty red man.

553
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,830
Now you've never seen a sick Indian.

554
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:40,037
They're all big, strong,
mighty men of nature,

555
00:26:40,537 --> 00:26:43,340
and why are they all
big, strong, mighty men?

556
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:48,340
Because they use Princess
Yo-Yo's Indian tonic exclusively.

557
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:50,890
And now, my good people,
this wonderful remedy

558
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,790
is worth $5 a bottle, but we're not going

559
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:56,380
to charge you $5, oh no.

560
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,660
Nor $2, nor $1, no sir.

561
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:04,297
You're going to buy this
wonderful tonic for just 25 cents.

562
00:27:04,297 --> 00:27:06,510
And because of the great
affection the princess has

563
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,660
for the people of this
community, with every two-bit

564
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,220
purchase, we're going to give you a bow,

565
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,890
made by the princess'
own brother, Eagle Beak.

566
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,170
Now you say to yourself,

567
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,580
what will I do with just a bow?

568
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,810
Well, we'll tell you.

569
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:24,630
With every 25-cent purchase
of the Princess Yo-Yo's tonic,

570
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,560
we're going to throw in an arrow,

571
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,620
so that you have the tonic,
and the bow and arrow,

572
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,183
all for the trifling sum of 25 cents.

573
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,890
Come on now, folks, step up
and get that first bottle.

574
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,960
Don't miss this amazing opportunity to buy

575
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,530
this great tonic for 25 cents a bottle,

576
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,047
or five bottles for $1.

577
00:27:43,047 --> 00:27:45,670
Let me just take one bottle
and pass it down among you.

578
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,590
Just pull the cork out of that,
my friend, and take a smell.

579
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,030
And don't forget, ladies
and gentlemen, that you get

580
00:27:51,222 --> 00:27:53,840
a bow and an arrow free
with this purchase.

581
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,583
- Miss Jinx, here's the $20 you need.

582
00:27:58,858 --> 00:27:59,691
Would you mind keeping an eye

583
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:00,970
on the Colonel's camera for me?

584
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,019
- Why sure.

585
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:03,003
- Thank you.

586
00:28:03,003 --> 00:28:04,112
- Okay.

587
00:28:04,112 --> 00:28:05,420
And now, folks, step right up

588
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,400
and get your bottle.

589
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,393
- Oh, Colonel, where's he going?

590
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:12,090
- He thinks he's going to New York.

591
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,437
- Here's the constable now.

592
00:28:13,437 --> 00:28:14,357
- I'm constable.

593
00:28:14,357 --> 00:28:15,810
- Constable, there's your man right there,

594
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,156
and I'm as guilty as he is.

595
00:28:17,156 --> 00:28:18,720
- You come along with me too then.

596
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,552
- You can't filch me outta
money, you city slickers.

597
00:28:21,552 --> 00:28:24,130
- First, you make me look
ridiculous with that fish.

598
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,560
Then, you almost drown me
on that silly raft of yours.

599
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,020
Next, we become entangled
with a broken-down carnival.

600
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,367
And you get a bright idea
on how to acquire $20

601
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:36,430
and we land in jail.

602
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,410
If you'd kept your mouth shut,

603
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,310
I woulda been on my way
to New York right now.

604
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,670
Are you
sure you told that girl

605
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,670
to take good care of the Blooming Daisy?

606
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,010
- A couple of tough fellas,
they put up a great struggle,

607
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,010
but I took them, single-handed.

608
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,153
Nobody ever gets away from me.

609
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,590
Gee Hossafatts.

610
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,383
I told you they was desperate.

611
00:29:03,383 --> 00:29:04,775
They musta dynamited.

612
00:29:04,775 --> 00:29:06,595
- This looks like an outside job.

613
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:15,720
- Do you realize we've broken the law

614
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,320
in leaving the jail in that manner?

615
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,342
- Well, let's go back, maybe
you can think of a better way.

616
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,002
- Miss Moore's liable to get
herself in serious trouble.

617
00:29:24,002 --> 00:29:25,940
If we're caught, she'll
be as guilty as we are.

618
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,422
- Don't think she doesn't know it.

619
00:29:27,422 --> 00:29:28,320
She's one of those regular people

620
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,720
I've been telling you about.

621
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:33,667
Let it go.

622
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:44,978
- Ah, howdy, Colonel.

623
00:29:44,978 --> 00:29:47,786
Well hello,
girls, how are you?

624
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:48,763
- Jinx?
- Yeah.

625
00:29:48,763 --> 00:29:49,793
- Take him in with you.

626
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:50,737
The cops might be here any minute.

627
00:29:50,737 --> 00:29:51,930
You know what to do.

628
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:52,763
- Right.

629
00:29:52,763 --> 00:29:53,596
- You come with me.

630
00:29:53,596 --> 00:29:54,601
- Miss Moore, don't you think--

631
00:29:54,601 --> 00:29:55,434
- Don't argue, come on.

632
00:29:55,434 --> 00:29:56,267
- Miss Moore.

633
00:29:56,267 --> 00:29:58,020
If you get a chance to talk with him,

634
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,140
keep your fingers
crossed for me, will you?

635
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,583
- Okay, Colonel.

636
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:04,540
- She sure isn't giving herself

637
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,360
the worst of the deal, is she?

638
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,080
- Come on, Snapshot
Willie, give me a hand.

639
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,960
Welcome home.

640
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:17,970
- Now, make yourself at home.

641
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:18,803
- Oh, thanks.

642
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,650
Miss Moore, I want you
to know that I appreciate

643
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,010
what you've done for us.

644
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:26,843
- Oh, skip it.

645
00:30:26,843 --> 00:30:29,701
You got my show out of a jam,
and I got you out of one.

646
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:30,534
Have a piece of pie.

647
00:30:30,534 --> 00:30:31,534
- Thank you.

648
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,570
Do you always put salt on your apple pie?

649
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,710
- Sure, why?

650
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,451
- I put salt on mine too.

651
00:30:38,451 --> 00:30:39,390
- So what?

652
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:42,660
- Miss Moore, don't you think
that could be sort of a sign?

653
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,660
- Sure it is.

654
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,987
It's a sign we both like
salt on our apple pie.

655
00:30:49,402 --> 00:30:52,613
You know, you're not a bad-looking guy.

656
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,136
You talk like you been to school and

657
00:30:56,136 --> 00:30:58,936
you're the kind of a fella
that any girl might fall for.

658
00:31:01,172 --> 00:31:03,590
The only thing wrong, though,
is your instincts are all bad.

659
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,660
- My instincts?

660
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,610
- Yeah, they're kinda
crooked if you ask me.

661
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,503
- Why, Miss Moore, I want you to know

662
00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:11,720
that my business integrity
has never been questioned.

663
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,460
- Aw, stop talking like a
gentleman of circumstance.

664
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,190
- You mean you don't like
gentlemen of circumstance?

665
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,940
- I should say not.

666
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,840
Gentleman is just a polite
word for loafer, if you ask me.

667
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,420
Aw, why don't you get an
honest job and go to work?

668
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,753
You might make something outta yourself.

669
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:31,060
I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.

670
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,017
- You did it!

671
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:32,980
- Did what?

672
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,448
- You crossed your fingers.

673
00:31:34,448 --> 00:31:35,880
- So what?

674
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,860
- Miss Moore, that is a sign.

675
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,940
- Wait a minute, what
is this sign language?

676
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,549
- Well, when a boy and a girl both cr--

677
00:31:42,842 --> 00:31:44,014
What's that?

678
00:31:44,014 --> 00:31:45,778
- It ain't the curfew.

679
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:54,643
This is it, Moore's Carnival.

680
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,360
- All right, Sheriff, you go
that way, I'll go this way.

681
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,499
We'll search every truck.

682
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,332
- Right.

683
00:32:04,148 --> 00:32:05,020
- Get down.

684
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,610
- What?
- Get down.

685
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,443
- Come in.

686
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,289
What do you mean by breaking
in on a lady's privacy?

687
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:16,453
- I'm looking for a
couple of jail breakers.

688
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,863
There ain't no privacy when
desperate criminals is at large.

689
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,224
I have every reason to believe

690
00:32:25,224 --> 00:32:27,317
they're right with this carnival.

691
00:32:27,317 --> 00:32:31,100
- Well you don't think I'd
have them in here, do you?

692
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,850
- You never can tell.

693
00:32:39,964 --> 00:32:40,797
Pardon,
ladies, but I'm looking

694
00:32:40,797 --> 00:32:41,840
for a couple of fugitives.

695
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,876
- Fugitives?

696
00:32:42,876 --> 00:32:44,890
- Mm, only if you find anybody,

697
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,607
save the prettiest one for me, will you?

698
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:47,693
- Very funny.

699
00:32:55,421 --> 00:32:56,329
- Well, any success?

700
00:32:56,329 --> 00:32:57,278
- No, not a trace of them.

701
00:32:57,278 --> 00:32:58,210
- What do we do now?

702
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,380
- I think we'd better get to a telephone

703
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,094
and notify every sheriff in the state.

704
00:33:01,094 --> 00:33:01,927
- Good idea.

705
00:33:01,927 --> 00:33:04,660
- Excuse me, Sheriff, I'd like
to suggest my remaining here

706
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,490
and keeping an eye open, just in case.

707
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,700
- That'd be all right with me.

708
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,550
- Thank you, sir.

709
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:14,543
- Boy, that was close.

710
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:16,683
Okay, Colonel, how you feel?

711
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,810
- Goodnight, he's stuck.

712
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:21,246
- Oh don't worry, we can
always use him for a camshaft.

713
00:33:21,246 --> 00:33:22,404
- Get me out of this.

714
00:33:22,404 --> 00:33:23,990
- Oh, don't let it get you down, Colonel.

715
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,590
I had an uncle who was that way for years.

716
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,503
He got it from looking through keyholes.

717
00:33:27,503 --> 00:33:28,772
Now relax!

718
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:30,817
That's it, here, here, hold him.

719
00:33:30,817 --> 00:33:32,849
Relax, you're too tense, come on.

720
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:35,003
That's it, there you are.

721
00:33:35,003 --> 00:33:36,807
Here, that's it, straighten up.

722
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:37,640
Now, how you feel?

723
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,473
- Oh, fine.

724
00:33:38,473 --> 00:33:39,306
- You sure?

725
00:33:39,306 --> 00:33:40,139
- Ooh, fine.

726
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:42,490
- I have to get a phone right there.

727
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,950
- Miss Moore, I've caused
you a lot of trouble,

728
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,710
and I'd like to be of some help.

729
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,586
If there's anything I can do.

730
00:33:47,586 --> 00:33:49,000
- Sure you can be a help.

731
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,190
As a roustabout for this
show, you probably won't be

732
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,180
worth your salt, but at
least it's an honest job.

733
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,237
Go back and tell the girls to come up here

734
00:33:55,237 --> 00:33:57,100
and you bunk with the Colonel.

735
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,190
- A roustabout?

736
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,250
- Yeah, a roustabout.

737
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,250
- Thank you.

738
00:34:15,976 --> 00:34:18,733
- Hold it, tie it, swing it, hit it.

739
00:34:18,733 --> 00:34:21,495
Hold it, tie it, swing it, hit it.

740
00:34:21,495 --> 00:34:24,328

00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,608
- Ready for breakfast?

781
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:21,600
- Ho ho, breakfast, serve it right here.

782
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,667
- No hurry, we usually work a little

783
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:24,930
around here before we eat.

784
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,840
- Work?

785
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,470
- Yeah, put those on.

786
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,150
- I protest, I'm a concessionaire
with this carnival,

787
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,380
and I wear what I please.

788
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,813
- I don't care how you dress,

789
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:34,763
so long as you pound those tent stakes.

790
00:36:39,286 --> 00:36:42,203
- A little work never hurt anybody.

791
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:44,770
- Good morning, Miss Moore.

792
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,220
- Oh hi ya, Joe.

793
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,001
- Miss Moore, I've had a pretty good offer

794
00:36:48,001 --> 00:36:50,597
from the Jones show, it
isn't that I wanna leave,

795
00:36:50,597 --> 00:36:52,547
but I have a wife and
kid back in Connecticut.

796
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:55,200
- I understand, Joe, I don't blame you.

797
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
The pay's been a little slow, but

798
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,900
well, we'll get along all right.

799
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,120
I'll send you back pay as soon
as we have a few good days.

800
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,900
- Oh, forget it, anytime.

801
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,830
- Oh, troopers nothing,
if I could ever get paid

802
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:05,793
I'd quit this dump in a minute.

803
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:07,460
- What are you crabbing about?

804
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,570
- Crabbing? She hasn't
paid me a dime in months.

805
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,220
- Don't you ever think of
anything else besides money?

806
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,860
Why don't you try smiling once in a while?

807
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,238
You know, ha ha ha, laugh and
the world laughs with you.

808
00:37:17,238 --> 00:37:18,303
- Oh, baloney.

809
00:37:18,303 --> 00:37:20,110
- Oh, why don't you try being like me?

810
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,790
- That's too much.

811
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,860
- Very funny.

812
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,840
But at least I like everybody
and I'm a little happy.

813
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,217
You every seen anyb-

814
00:37:27,217 --> 00:37:30,413
Oh come now, wait, let's not
go through all this again.

815
00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:31,833
We have enough trouble.

816
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:32,666
Come on.

817
00:37:34,928 --> 00:37:39,080
Uh, aw, not wait a minute,
let's get this thing straight.

818
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,570
You see, I'm really not an Indian.

819
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:44,723
Only kidding with that Yo-Yo
stuff, you know, just kidding.

820
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:46,526
In fact, I was born in Brooklyn.

821
00:37:46,526 --> 00:37:48,264
You know Brooklyn?

822
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,800
- Mr. Gaines?
- Oh good morning, Stanhope.

823
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,670
- Good morning to you, sir.

824
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,574
I've been dreadfully worried about you.

825
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:58,040
A man of your position in
an environment of this kind.

826
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,235
- Don't worry about me, I'm all right.

827
00:38:00,235 --> 00:38:02,153
- Well I'm glad to hear that.

828
00:38:02,153 --> 00:38:03,860
Is there something I can do for you, sir?

829
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,770
- No, nothing at all.

830
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:05,603
- Well if you're not too busy,

831
00:38:05,603 --> 00:38:06,920
you can try pounding some stakes for me.

832
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,800
- No, Colonel, that would never do.

833
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,790
Just stay around in the
background, I'll see you later.

834
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,623
- Yes, sir.

835
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:12,456
- Come on, Colonel.

836
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,240
- Oh ho, what an invigorating morning.

837
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,475
I'm ready for an order of scrambled eggs,

838
00:38:20,475 --> 00:38:22,640
a ration of bacon and
a huge pot of coffee.

839
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,987
- All right, you guys, start
pounding this row of stakes

840
00:38:24,987 --> 00:38:27,570
and that row of stakes over
there, then you can eat.

841
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:28,950
- I protest, I'm a concessionaire.

842
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,130
- So am I a concessionaire,
but we pound stakes

843
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,650
around here before we eat.

844
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,810
- I said that I would--

845
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,723
- I said pound that stake.

846
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:37,927
- Yes, sir.

847
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,680
- Say, just a minute.

848
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,410
- What's on your mind?

849
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,500
- How would you like to be the head man

850
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,410
in the best carnival in the world?

851
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,430
- Who wouldn't?

852
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,570
- How much would it cost?

853
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,050
- About 200 grand.

854
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,590
- I'd like to have you pick one up for me.

855
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,890
- Wouldn't you like a nice,
new electric train set too?

856
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:56,020
- No, wait a minute, you don't understand.

857
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,910
Stanhope.

858
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,370
- Where would a punk
like you get 200 grand?

859
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,950
- Yes, sir.
- A blank check, please.

860
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,110
- Yes, sir.

861
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,850
- I want you to accompany this gentleman.

862
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,140
You're going to buy a carnival.

863
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,340
- A carnival, sir?

864
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,000
- Yes, just fill this check
in for any amount necessary.

865
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,780
I want the very best, do you understand?

866
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,613
Yes, Mr. Gaines.

867
00:39:11,613 --> 00:39:13,530
- Say, listen, if this
check bounces back on me,

868
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,150
I'm gonna bounce right back on you.

869
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,530
- I beg your pardon, you're
speaking about Mr. Gaines.

870
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,190
We never have check trouble.

871
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,870
Now if you'll just come with
me, we'll attend to everything.

872
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,166
- Hey, this is all over my
head, I don't understand this.

873
00:39:24,166 --> 00:39:25,450
- Let me know when it's ready.

874
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,373
Yes, sir.

875
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,470
- Take care of your own stake.

876
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,549
I'm having trouble enough with this one.

877
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,018
You pound this row, I'll
pound the other one.

878
00:39:42,018 --> 00:39:42,901
- Okay.

879
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,481
That's good.

880
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:11,441
Okay.

881
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,563
Okay, boys.

882
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,130
- Hey, Colonel, come on
over and help with these.

883
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,673
- You'll do no such thing.

884
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,806
You're doing a fine job, Colonel,

885
00:40:38,806 --> 00:40:39,680
your stakes are all done.

886
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,830
You go ahead and have breakfast.

887
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,580
- Thank you, Miss Moore, thank you.

888
00:40:44,769 --> 00:40:46,375
- Good morning, Miss Moore.

889
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:47,617
- You can't even pound a few stakes

890
00:40:47,617 --> 00:40:48,903
without hollering for help, huh?

891
00:40:48,903 --> 00:40:49,736
- I didn't mean--

892
00:40:49,736 --> 00:40:51,460
- You notice the Colonel
finished all of his, don't you?

893
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,293
- Well, yes, but he--

894
00:40:52,293 --> 00:40:53,126
- Don't interrupt.

895
00:40:53,126 --> 00:40:55,701
Look, you pound these
stakes before breakfast,

896
00:40:55,701 --> 00:40:56,847
and if you can't do that, well,

897
00:40:56,847 --> 00:40:58,373
you just be right on your way.

898
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,293
Hi, Officer, hope you
like our show this year.

899
00:41:06,293 --> 00:41:07,753
- All right, can that.

900
00:41:08,705 --> 00:41:10,790
As sheriff of this town,
I order you to pack up

901
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,190
your troupe and get moving.

902
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,590
And the sooner the better.

903
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:14,423
- But why?

904
00:41:14,423 --> 00:41:17,120
- Well I got word from
the last town that you hit

905
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,930
that you're carrying a
couple of crooks with you,

906
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,207
so come on, get going.

907
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:21,470
- On now look, Sheriff, there's--

908
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,233
- I said get going.

909
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,540
- Okay.

910
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,153
All right, boys, pack it up.

911
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,980
- I beg your pardon, Sheriff,
but I believe if you'll give

912
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,070
me a moment I can straighten out

913
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,190
this little misunderstanding.

914
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,023
- Can that stuff.

915
00:41:36,023 --> 00:41:37,370
- Oh no no, I wanna present you

916
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,220
with a portrait to take home to your wife.

917
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,044
- Oh, well, that sounds all right.

918
00:41:41,044 --> 00:41:41,877
- There you are, just stand right there,

919
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:44,730
not too far away here,
while I extend the lens.

920
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,640
Turn the little wheel

921
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,337
and pull the bulb, are you ready?

922
00:41:48,337 --> 00:41:50,180
Hold it, that's it.

923
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,470
I've had great success with
these family portraits.

924
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,600
If you'll bear with me just a moment

925
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,770
as we go through the
developing process here.

926
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:58,470
And pull the little string here.

927
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:59,850
I believe I'll show you something

928
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,818
that your wife's going
to be very happy about.

929
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,440
- So you're a fresh guy, huh?

930
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,847
Now you grab that thing and get outta town

931
00:42:12,847 --> 00:42:14,982
before I run you in.

932
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:21,033
♪ Swing it, hit it, pull it, tie it ♪

933
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:23,531
♪ Swing it, hit it, pull it, tie it ♪

934
00:42:23,531 --> 00:42:26,403
♪ Swing it, hit it, pull it, tie it ♪

935
00:42:26,403 --> 00:42:29,086
♪ Bop bobba doop dop ♪

936
00:42:29,086 --> 00:42:33,975
♪ Calliope Jane put on your
bonnet and bloop again ♪

937
00:42:33,975 --> 00:42:34,990
- I hope the new carnival will be

938
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:37,200
the finest thing on wheels.

939
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,040
I wanna make Penguin really happy.

940
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,030
- Now listen, young Drogo,
your idea of romance

941
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,871
is a yacht here, a bracelet there,

942
00:42:43,871 --> 00:42:46,450
an Irving coat thrown in
and now a new carnival.

943
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:48,560
Why, you're just a checkbook lover.

944
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,771
Don't you know by this time
that this girl is different?

945
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:01,401
- All together now, push, that's it!

946
00:43:03,304 --> 00:43:05,285
That's gonna do you no good in the mud.

947
00:43:05,285 --> 00:43:07,344
Get up outta the mud there, young Drogo.

948
00:43:07,344 --> 00:43:09,894
We can't have this kind of thing.

949
00:43:28,445 --> 00:43:29,278
- Ah.

950
00:43:30,867 --> 00:43:31,700
Ah.

951
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:34,278
Ah.

952
00:43:35,694 --> 00:43:36,527
Ah.

953
00:43:37,528 --> 00:43:38,361
Ah.

954
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:40,670
- Hey, you're getting
to be an expert at this.

955
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:42,130
- Oh, thanks.

956
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,570
- Matter of fact, you've
been doing so well lately

957
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:46,120
that I've decided to
promote you to a better job.

958
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,392
- That's great.

959
00:43:47,392 --> 00:43:50,450
What's it going to be?

960
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:52,487
- Here's your new
outfit, put it on tonight

961
00:43:52,487 --> 00:43:53,773
and you'll understand.

962
00:44:02,266 --> 00:44:04,592
- Oh, no, you again.

963
00:44:04,592 --> 00:44:05,425
- How.

964
00:44:05,425 --> 00:44:08,253
- Listen, for the last
time, I am not an Indian.

965
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:16,311
Hey, what is this?

966
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,403
Oh no, look, no comic valentines,
now go away, I'm busy.

967
00:44:23,874 --> 00:44:25,640
- Colonel, I can't go out there like this.

968
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,440
- Why not? You look beautiful.

969
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,573
- That's just the trouble.

970
00:44:28,573 --> 00:44:30,520
- Now, ladies and gentlemen, the featured

971
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,368
free attraction of the show.

972
00:44:32,368 --> 00:44:35,077
The world's greatest aerial artiste.

973
00:44:35,077 --> 00:44:38,005
The one and only Miss Penguin Moore,

974
00:44:38,005 --> 00:44:39,919
assisted by Gavin Cavalerro.

975
00:44:45,194 --> 00:44:46,611
- No, I, I can't.

976
00:45:03,232 --> 00:45:04,923
- Take off your robe.

977
00:46:19,187 --> 00:46:20,537
- Ladies and gentlemen, I--

978
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:26,240
Oh, okay, Officer, we'll be on our way.

979
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,350
- But listen, girl, can't you see your way

980
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:32,970
to give him another chance?

981
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:34,640
- You saw what happened tonight, Colonel.

982
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,720
I gave him a chance, and he just doesn't

983
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,962
belong in show business.

984
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:39,950
- Oh ho, that's funny.

985
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:40,960
- What's funny about that?

986
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,360
- Doesn't belong in show business.

987
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,469
Well, I don't suppose you
ever heard of the Great Drogo.

988
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,691
- The Great Drogo?

989
00:46:46,691 --> 00:46:49,427
- The feature act of every
show he ever played in.

990
00:46:49,427 --> 00:46:50,260
- Drogo?

991
00:46:51,757 --> 00:46:52,590
Drogo?

992
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,940
Aerialist?

993
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,847
- Hm-mm.

994
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:57,680
- Drogo?

995
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,182
Equestrian?

996
00:47:00,182 --> 00:47:01,015
- Hm-mm.

997
00:47:03,294 --> 00:47:05,300
- Well, there was a Rogo,

998
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,543
Rogo's lion act.

999
00:47:08,037 --> 00:47:08,870
Or was it Drogo?

1000
00:47:11,483 --> 00:47:13,820
Drogo's lions, was that it?

1001
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,992
- I didn't say it, girl, now
remember I didn't tell you.

1002
00:47:16,992 --> 00:47:18,353
- Why.

1003
00:47:18,353 --> 00:47:21,510
Drogo's lions, that was the greatest act

1004
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,920
that ever played under the big top.

1005
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,010
- Well, I can see it now.

1006
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,913
London, Paris, Vienna,
the applause of thousands.

1007
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,093
- What made him give it up?

1008
00:47:31,093 --> 00:47:32,047
- What's that?

1009
00:47:32,047 --> 00:47:34,930
Oh, there he stood, night after night,

1010
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:36,640
with guns in his hands.

1011
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,474
Then came a time when the
animals weren't enough.

1012
00:47:39,474 --> 00:47:40,810
Oh, forget the past.

1013
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,353
He'll come back, girl, he'll come back.

1014
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,600
- I feel like a fool, Colonel.

1015
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:49,350
Imagine me making him pound stakes

1016
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:51,693
in a silly two-by-four show like this.

1017
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:54,540
Making out like I was the big shot.

1018
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,363
I gotta talk to him, Colonel.

1019
00:48:02,766 --> 00:48:04,036
- Drogo, come here.

1020
00:48:04,036 --> 00:48:05,520
- Oh I'm very busy, Miss Moore.

1021
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,693
- I wanna talk to you.

1022
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:10,860
- Miss Moore, I want you
to know that I'm sorry

1023
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,440
about what happened in your act.

1024
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,450
I'll try to make up for
it in any way I can.

1025
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:17,240
- Oh forget about it,
Drogo, and stop tiring

1026
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,488
yourself out with the stuff around here.

1027
00:48:19,488 --> 00:48:22,228
- That's very nice of you, Miss Moore.

1028
00:48:22,228 --> 00:48:24,570
I didn't ever expect you
to speak to me again.

1029
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,907
- Don't talk like that, Drogo.

1030
00:48:26,907 --> 00:48:28,600
You make me feel so foolish.

1031
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,400
To think I've been making you pound stakes

1032
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,220
and do things around here
that any kid could do.

1033
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,290
- I wanna learn all I can and help.

1034
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,150
- You're going to.

1035
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,470
You're gonna go right back
to the top where you belong.

1036
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:41,080
You won't get in with the
wrong people this time,

1037
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,853
because I'll take the guns
out of your hands every night.

1038
00:48:44,853 --> 00:48:45,686
- Guns?

1039
00:48:46,718 --> 00:48:48,170
That's certainly nice of you,
Miss Moore, but I don't--

1040
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,620
- Now you don't have to say anything.

1041
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,920
I know we're gonna get along
swell together from now on.

1042
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:02,144
- Colonel, what do you think?

1043
00:49:02,144 --> 00:49:02,977
- What?

1044
00:49:02,477 --> 00:49:03,350
- Miss Moore just spoke to me

1045
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:05,540
and forgave me for what I did to her act.

1046
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,230
She was so sweet I can't get over it.

1047
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,307
She said we'd get along swell together.

1048
00:49:10,307 --> 00:49:11,710
- Certainly, you'll get
along swell together.

1049
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:13,823
Why shouldn't two great showmen
get along swell together?

1050
00:49:13,823 --> 00:49:14,870
- What do you mean?

1051
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:17,120
I don't know anything
about the show business.

1052
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,400
- I know you don't and you
know you don't, but, uh.

1053
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,409
- But what?

1054
00:49:20,409 --> 00:49:22,120
- Well, I told her you
were a great showman.

1055
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,633
- Oh, Colonel, why did you
tell her a thing like that?

1056
00:49:24,633 --> 00:49:27,198
- Well you're an imposter, aren't you?

1057
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:29,613
Better to be a good
imposter than a bad one?

1058
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:33,980
- What kind of a showman
did you tell her I was?

1059
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:37,381
- Well I told her you were a lion tamer.

1060
00:49:37,381 --> 00:49:38,480
- A li--, a li--

1061
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,963
Colonel, come back here.

1062
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,236
Why did you tell her that?

1063
00:49:43,236 --> 00:49:45,196
- Well there are no lions with this show.

1064
00:49:45,196 --> 00:49:46,029
- No.

1065
00:49:46,029 --> 00:49:49,362
- Well what have you got to worry about?

1066
00:49:50,937 --> 00:49:52,884
♪ You bloop all my cares away. ♪

1067
00:49:52,884 --> 00:49:55,491

Willie, you come with me.

1069
00:49:56,589 --> 00:49:58,486

Here, come here.

1076
00:50:15,872 --> 00:50:18,920

stay outta my way, I'm busy.

00:50:42,643 --> 00:50:44,680
- Glad to see you, Penguin, how are you?

1080
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,389
- Oh fine, sorry to get
you up at this hour.

1081
00:50:47,389 --> 00:50:48,633
- Oh, that's all right.

1082
00:50:48,633 --> 00:50:50,400
- We couldn't sleep anyway,
what's on your mind?

1083
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,740
- Well I got a spot in
my show for your lions.

1084
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,640
Still got them, haven't you?

1085
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,320
- Sure, there they are, come on.

1086
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,820
- I got the best lion
trainer in the business.

1087
00:50:58,820 --> 00:50:59,990
How about letting me take them

1088
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,560
and at the end of the season we'll split?

1089
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,570
- Well it's okay with me
if it's okay with Moe.

1090
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:04,860
- It's okay with me, Joe.

1091
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,580
Matter of fact, I'm glad you came.

1092
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,020
We were just talking about
turning them over to the zoo.

1093
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,500
Business has been so bad
we can't even feed them.

1094
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,474
Take a peek.

1095
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:17,730
- They don't look underfed to me.

1096
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:18,563
- Me either.

1097
00:51:18,563 --> 00:51:20,300
In fact, they look powerful healthy.

1098
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,100
- There's nothing to worry about.

1099
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,760
All you gotta do is follow
the instructions in this book.

1100
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,640
Gives you their names, the
tricks they do and everything.

1101
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,473
- That's swell.

1102
00:51:30,473 --> 00:51:32,283
There you are, Willie,
read it over carefully.

1103
00:51:32,283 --> 00:51:34,300
From now on, you're taking care of them.

1104
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,210
Come on, let's go.

1105
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,950
- Okay, we'll give you a hand.

1106
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:37,783
- You mean?

1107
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,313
I guess she do.

1108
00:51:42,313 --> 00:51:43,396
Nealo, Rollo.

1109
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:47,012
Nealo?

1110
00:51:48,517 --> 00:51:49,804
Nealo?

1111
00:51:52,623 --> 00:51:53,836
Nealo, Rollo.

1112
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,560
That did it.

1113
00:52:06,898 --> 00:52:07,934
- Good morning, Miss Moore.

1114
00:52:07,434 --> 00:52:08,398
- Good morning, Drogo.

1115
00:52:08,398 --> 00:52:10,220
- I think you ought to know
that what the Colonel said was--

1116
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,290
- Aw, don't blame him.

1117
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:13,557
I'm happy to know that you're one of us.

1118
00:52:13,557 --> 00:52:16,430
- Well I certainly do wanna be one of us.

1119
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,996
- There's something I want you to have.

1120
00:52:18,996 --> 00:52:20,270
Belonged to my dad.

1121
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,992
He was a lion trainer, too.

1122
00:52:21,992 --> 00:52:23,253
- Oh, thanks.

1123
00:52:24,354 --> 00:52:25,820
- Drogo?

1124
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,370
I want you to know how I feel about you

1125
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:29,610
seeing as we're both showmen.

1126
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:31,920
I liked you from the
start, but that was as far

1127
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,120
as it could ever go because,

1128
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,290
well, I had no idea you were my kind.

1129
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:37,999
- Miss Moore, I think you
ought to know the truth.

1130
00:52:37,999 --> 00:52:41,370
- Nevermind, it's what's
going to happen that counts.

1131
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:43,530
- I'll certainly do my best.

1132
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:44,767
- You haven't any scratches on you.

1133
00:52:44,767 --> 00:52:47,660
Didn't the lions ever
claw you or jump you?

1134
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,710
- To tell the truth, they never did.

1135
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:52,047
- Gosh, you must have been great.

1136
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:53,990
Wouldn't you like to take
up where you left off,

1137
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:56,140
cracking the whip and
hearing the applause?

1138
00:52:57,070 --> 00:52:58,370
Wouldn't you do it for me?

1139
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:02,390
- I guess I'd do just
about anything for you.

1140
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:04,640
- Well, here they are.

1141
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,090
Not much after what you've
had, but it's a beginning.

1142
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:08,630
- They're lions.

1143
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:09,720
- Don't expect too much of them,

1144
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,863
because they haven't been
worked in quite a while.

1145
00:53:19,006 --> 00:53:21,673
- Is you gonna train them lions?

1146
00:53:22,598 --> 00:53:23,431
- Uh-uh.

1147
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,840
- Aw, it's no use, Colonel,
I can't go through with it.

1148
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,170
- Now don't be silly.

1149
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:44,180
Now look, you're a
millionaire, aren't you?

1150
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,520
- What's that got to do with it?

1151
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,610
- Everything, why you'd
be the first millionaire

1152
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:48,850
lion tamer in the world.

1153
00:53:48,850 --> 00:53:50,620
Think of the honor.

1154
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,800
Besides, I'm sure that
nothing will happen to you.

1155
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,120
Those lions are easy to work
with, aren't they, Willie?

1156
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,007
- That's what it says here.

1157
00:53:56,007 --> 00:53:57,280
- There, you see?

1158
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,420
Now look, I'm going to show you once more.

1159
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,350
You need have no fear.

1160
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,940
Why, no lion has ever been
known to pass a chair.

1161
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,760
Now, you advance boldly.

1162
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:10,424
Chair in one hand, and whip in the other.

1163
00:54:25,607 --> 00:54:26,440
- Uh-oh.

1164
00:54:28,451 --> 00:54:31,226
- All right, ladies and gentlemen,
step up and buy yourself

1165
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,882
a ticket to the greatest
thrill of your life.

1166
00:54:33,882 --> 00:54:34,823
Thank you.

1167
00:54:34,823 --> 00:54:37,093
Fearless Drogo, the one and only,

1168
00:54:37,093 --> 00:54:39,166
the world's greatest lion tamer,

1169
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:42,012
is going to face one
of the most ferocious--

1170
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:43,383
- Jinx, how's it going?

1171
00:54:43,383 --> 00:54:44,556
- Oh couldn't be better.

1172
00:54:44,556 --> 00:54:47,184
Step right up, ladies and
gentlemen, here you are.

1173
00:54:47,184 --> 00:54:48,297
- Did you get the smelling salts?

1174
00:54:48,297 --> 00:54:49,130
- Yes.

1175
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:50,060
- The bandages?
- Yes.

1176
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,217
- The iodine?
- Yes.

1177
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:54,888
- I forgot something.

1178
00:54:54,888 --> 00:54:55,721
- What?

1179
00:54:55,721 --> 00:54:56,554
- I forgot to feed them.

1180
00:54:56,554 --> 00:54:57,387
- Sh.

1181
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,390
What's the matter, boy?

1182
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:04,353
- Colonel, I can't go through with it.

1183
00:55:04,353 --> 00:55:06,137
- Well you love her, don't you?

1184
00:55:06,137 --> 00:55:08,430
All you've got to do is to
remember what I told you.

1185
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,380
When you get in that cage,
keep jabbing with that chair

1186
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,479
and cross with your whip.

1187
00:55:13,479 --> 00:55:16,047
Listen to them, boy, listen, what a crowd.

1188
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:22,101
- Can't hold them much longer,
they're waiting for you.

1189
00:55:22,101 --> 00:55:23,117
- The lions?

1190
00:55:23,117 --> 00:55:24,910
- No, the people, silly.

1191
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:26,020
Gosh, you look wonderful.

1192
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:29,403
Now go on out there and knock them cold.

1193
00:55:29,403 --> 00:55:31,332
Tell me, Colonel, is he thrilled?

1194
00:55:31,332 --> 00:55:33,321
- Thrilled is not the word for it, girl.

1195
00:55:33,321 --> 00:55:36,243
He's trembling, with anticipation.

1196
00:55:36,243 --> 00:55:37,258
- You wanna go in there?

1197
00:55:37,258 --> 00:55:39,173
- No, no, I've got a better idea.

1198
00:55:42,113 --> 00:55:45,703
Hey, Hup, Texas, Hero, Cesar.

1199
00:55:50,627 --> 00:55:51,990
Hup, Cesar.

1200
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:53,518
- What's he trying to do, Colonel?

1201
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:55,070
He's working the cats from the outside.

1202
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:56,280
- Yeah.

1203
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,350
Well, you wouldn't expect the Great Drogo

1204
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:59,250
to do the usual thing.

1205
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:02,010
Anybody can work lions
from the inside of a cage.

1206
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:04,823
What a man, he's working
them from the outside.

1207
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,440
- That may be swell, Colonel,

1208
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,871
but I don't think these
yokels understand that.

1209
00:56:10,871 --> 00:56:12,523
I'll tell him to do it the easy way.

1210
00:56:16,694 --> 00:56:18,260
Drogo, I think you better
do it the regular way.

1211
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,500
- I can do it fine from out here.

1212
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,570
- I know, but these
people don't understand.

1213
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:24,704
I think you better work on the inside.

1214
00:56:24,704 --> 00:56:27,603
Okay, folks, everything'll
be fine in just a minute.

1215
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,710
Oh, this would have to happen to me.

1216
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:35,324
- What's going to happen to you?

1217
00:56:35,324 --> 00:56:37,388
- Can't you see, the rain
is gonna ruin the act?

1218
00:56:37,388 --> 00:56:38,971
We can't put it on.

1219
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:41,541
Willie, put them away.

1220
00:56:41,541 --> 00:56:42,624
- Yes, ma'am.

1221
00:56:48,846 --> 00:56:51,404
- It's just a little shower,
it's gonna be all right.

1222
00:56:51,404 --> 00:56:52,737
All right, here.

1223
00:56:55,937 --> 00:56:59,270
- How am I gonna get back to my trailer.

1224
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:07,260
- There you are.

1225
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,503
- That was sweet of you, JoJo.

1226
00:57:08,503 --> 00:57:10,420
- Aw, don't mention it.

1227
00:57:17,578 --> 00:57:19,215
Did you do that on purpose?

1228
00:57:19,215 --> 00:57:20,882
- What do you think?

1229
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:28,877
Did you do that?

1230
00:57:28,877 --> 00:57:29,710
- You figure it out.

1231
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:31,320
- Why you, you!

1232
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,423
- Now wait a minute, if you
hadn't let your stupid instincts

1233
00:57:33,423 --> 00:57:36,441
get the better of you, all
this wouldn't have happened.

1234
00:57:36,441 --> 00:57:38,120
- And after all I've done for you.

1235
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,203
Why, for two pence, I'd.

1236
00:57:41,037 --> 00:57:43,963
- Aw, you poor kid, nevermind.

1237
00:57:43,963 --> 00:57:47,059
Someday you'll have a fine new carnival.

1238
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:48,873
- I don't want a new carnival.

1239
00:57:48,873 --> 00:57:51,401
All I want is good business for this one.

1240
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:53,184
- You mean you don't want a new carnival?

1241
00:57:53,184 --> 00:57:56,438

1267
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,020
Real, sincere,

1268
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:47,853
different.

1269
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,640
- Yes, the others are all
alike, but she's different.

1270
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,040
I know, my boy, I know.

1271
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,274
Love is like hash.

1272
01:01:07,274 --> 01:01:09,853
You've got to have
confidence in it to enjoy it.

1273
01:01:10,807 --> 01:01:12,660
That must have been Bob Hope.

1274
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:16,784
Well, go to sleep, my boy, or are you?

1275
01:01:29,614 --> 01:01:31,780
- Good morning, sirs.

1276
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:34,195
Oh yes, sir, Mr. Newton.

1277
01:01:34,195 --> 01:01:36,091
- Oh, Mr. Whitman.

1278
01:01:36,091 --> 01:01:37,396
- Yes, Bates, what is it?

1279
01:01:37,396 --> 01:01:38,921
- Begging your pardon, sir,

1280
01:01:38,921 --> 01:01:40,650
but I'm afraid we have
gypsies on the grounds.

1281
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:41,483
- Gypsies?

1282
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:45,260
Well, Bates, do something.

1283
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:46,670
Get rid of them right away.

1284
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,300
- Yes, sir, right away, sir.

1285
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,633
- Wait a minute, Bates.

1286
01:01:49,633 --> 01:01:50,466
Do you speak Gypsy?

1287
01:01:50,466 --> 01:01:51,640
- Oh no, sir.

1288
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:53,290
- Nevermind, I'll go myself.

1289
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:54,790
Order the chief's car right away.

1290
01:01:54,790 --> 01:01:56,017
- Yes, sir.

1291
01:01:56,017 --> 01:01:57,373
- Come on, boys.

1292
01:01:57,373 --> 01:01:59,510
Hurry, hurry, hurry, come this way!

1293
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:01,569
Hear all about the big
surprise I promised you.

1294
01:02:01,569 --> 01:02:03,028
- The what?
- Surprise, huh?

1295
01:02:03,028 --> 01:02:04,040
- Come on, everybody.

1296
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,500
This way, everybody.

1297
01:02:07,034 --> 01:02:07,951
Sh, sh, sh.

1298
01:02:08,867 --> 01:02:09,930
Now listen, boys and girls.

1299
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:11,840
I told you I'd bring you
to the land of plenty.

1300
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,780
Well, here it is.

1301
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,960
Why the food lies on the
ground for the taking.

1302
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,020
- Did you say food?

1303
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:19,160
- Right, groceries, grub, vittles.

1304
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:20,640
Now some of you go that way and pick

1305
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:21,750
the berries from the vines.

1306
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:24,590
The peas, beans, cabbages and
other vegetables are that way.

1307
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:27,445
Let your stomachs be your guide, be gone.

1308
01:02:28,817 --> 01:02:31,957
And the watermelons are that way.

1309
01:02:34,410 --> 01:02:35,480
Oh, Willie.

1310
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,573
Yes, Mr. Colonel.

1311
01:02:36,573 --> 01:02:39,510
- And the chicken house is over there.

1312
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:41,110
- Chicken house?
- Uh-huh.

1313
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:42,890
- What am I waiting for?
- I don't know.

1314
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:45,213
- Me either, tally ho.

1315
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:54,234
- Say, Joe, what's the
idea of pitching here?

1316
01:02:54,234 --> 01:02:55,817
- Colonel's orders.

1317
01:02:56,794 --> 01:02:58,590
- Colonel's orders?

1318
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:01,620
- Well what are we gonna get
for customers here, field mice?

1319
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:05,370
- Quiet, quiet, ain't no use of squawking.

1320
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:07,343
We all gotta go someday.

1321
01:03:07,343 --> 01:03:10,037
It's either gonna be you or
me, and it ain't gonna be me.

1322
01:03:17,953 --> 01:03:20,290
- Take your time, take
your time, don't rush me.

1323
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:21,123
- The man's right.

1324
01:03:21,123 --> 01:03:22,125
- Thank you.

1325
01:03:22,125 --> 01:03:25,093
- You welcome, now will you
fix the fowls please, first?

1326
01:03:30,926 --> 01:03:32,282
- Say, Red, where'd you get these?

1327
01:03:32,282 --> 01:03:33,525
- Well the Colonel told us we could pick

1328
01:03:33,525 --> 01:03:34,728
anything we wanted to.

1329
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:36,470
- Oh he did, eh?

1330
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:38,658
Well I'm still giving
orders around here, I think.

1331
01:03:40,657 --> 01:03:41,490
- Okay, boys, you heard
the boss, break it up.

1332
01:03:43,097 --> 01:03:44,320
- Get this stuff outta here.

1333
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,859
- Yes'm, Miss Moore,
but the Colonel said--

1334
01:03:45,859 --> 01:03:47,586
- I don't care what the Colonel said.

1335
01:03:47,586 --> 01:03:48,897
We're not taking anything
that doesn't belong to us.

1336
01:03:48,897 --> 01:03:50,433
Now put it back where you got it.

1337
01:03:50,433 --> 01:03:51,357
- Yeah, and make it snappy

1338
01:03:51,357 --> 01:03:52,815
or we'll all be thrown in the clink.

1339
01:03:54,189 --> 01:03:56,450
- Sound like we're
practically in the clink.

1340
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:58,223
- All right, fellas, get rid of it quick.

1341
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:00,003
- All right, you heard the boss.

1342
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:02,971
Get rid of it, come on, put a move on.

1343
01:04:02,971 --> 01:04:04,228
What's going on around here?

1344
01:04:04,228 --> 01:04:06,955
That's it, get going, come on, get going.

1345
01:04:06,955 --> 01:04:08,000
Well, well.

1346
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,693
- It's a shame to have to
put back these tender birds.

1347
01:04:11,655 --> 01:04:13,079
- Are they very tender?

1348
01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:14,040
- Mm-hmm.

1349
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:15,230
- Hmm.

1350
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:19,065
It would be kind of a shame, wouldn't it?

1351
01:04:18,565 --> 01:04:20,128
In that box, come on.

1352
01:04:20,128 --> 01:04:22,106
Be careful, but hurry.

1353
01:04:22,106 --> 01:04:24,593
Come on, get it going.

1354
01:04:24,593 --> 01:04:26,926
Now sit down, right there, that's it.

1355
01:04:26,926 --> 01:04:28,593
Now, act nonchalant.

1356
01:04:38,068 --> 01:04:39,980
- What do you mean trespassing
on private property?

1357
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,790
- Now, don't get excited,
Mister, you've got us all wrong.

1358
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:43,623
- Oh have I?

1359
01:04:43,623 --> 01:04:44,456
- Mm-hmm.

1360
01:04:44,456 --> 01:04:46,896
- Well then, I'm very sorry.

1361
01:04:46,896 --> 01:04:49,360
- You see, I'm Penguin Moore,
and this is my carnival.

1362
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,080
We got lost last night and wound up here.

1363
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,840
We didn't know it was your property.

1364
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,300
But we didn't take anything.

1365
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:55,810
- Well if you didn't take anything,

1366
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:57,450
I guess there's no harm done.

1367
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:58,330
You've got quite a lot here.

1368
01:04:58,330 --> 01:04:59,410
- Would you like to look around?

1369
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:00,810
- Oh, I'd love to, do you mind?

1370
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:01,870
- Oh not at all.

1371
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:03,764
There's a pin game over there.

1372
01:05:04,264 --> 01:05:05,920
- I hate pins.

1373
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,067
- Here's a merry-go-round.

1374
01:05:07,067 --> 01:05:08,594
- Oh, it makes me dizzy.

1375
01:05:08,594 --> 01:05:09,789
- We've got a lot of
other things here that--

1376
01:05:10,289 --> 01:05:12,110
- What's this contraption?

1377
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:14,170
- Oh, this is a taffy machine.

1378
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:15,350
Would you like to see it work?

1379
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:16,183
- Oh may I?

1380
01:05:16,183 --> 01:05:17,280
- Okay, Bob, I'll take care of it.

1381
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,113
- Okay, Miss Moore.

1382
01:05:18,113 --> 01:05:20,040
- Mechanical devices intrigue me.

1383
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,601
- Here's the switch here, you see,

1384
01:05:21,601 --> 01:05:22,670
and you pull it down,

1385
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:25,469
the machine goes around
with the taffy on it.

1386
01:05:30,073 --> 01:05:30,967
- Uh-oh.

1387
01:05:34,194 --> 01:05:36,370
- Hmm, what'll they think of next?

1388
01:05:39,437 --> 01:05:42,121
- The most interesting part's
down there where the motor is.

1389
01:05:45,357 --> 01:05:47,880
- You're right, it's a dandy.

1390
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:50,845
My favorite gear ratio, 15 to one.

1391
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,940
Did you see what I saw?

1392
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,457
- Why, did you see something?

1393
01:06:18,457 --> 01:06:20,142
- Let's forget it.

01:06:40,109 --> 01:06:41,205
- Uncle Carleton, it's you.

01:06:41,205 --> 01:06:43,751
- Why certainly it's
me, who did you expect?

1405
01:06:43,751 --> 01:06:44,807
- I can't tell you how
happy I am to see you.

1406
01:06:44,807 --> 01:06:46,260
I've been quite worried.

1407
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:48,240
- Well, Harry, your worries are over.

1408
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,320
Come over here, I want you
to meet a friend of mine.

1409
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,153
Oh, Penguin.

1410
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,470
This is my nephew, Harry Whitman.

1411
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:56,040
I'm one of his poor relations.

1412
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:57,010
- How do you do?

1413
01:06:57,010 --> 01:06:57,880
Oh we've met.

1414
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,140
- Good, then we can get down to business.

1415
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,660
How many weekend guests have you?

1416
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,227
- We have a whole house full.

1417
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:04,494
There's the Van Swiggens,
the Mortons, the Dumonts.

1418
01:07:04,494 --> 01:07:05,327
- That's enough.

1419
01:07:05,327 --> 01:07:06,160
- The Grahams.

1420
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,211
- I said that's enough.

1421
01:07:07,211 --> 01:07:08,780
Have them all come down here,
I guarantee they'll have

1422
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:11,852
a better time than they've
had in days, weeks, years.

1423
01:07:11,852 --> 01:07:13,482
- If it's that good, I'll tell them.

1424
01:07:14,961 --> 01:07:15,794
- Gangway.

1425
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:19,271
Tell them not to forget their wallets.

1426
01:07:19,271 --> 01:07:20,731
Give me that sign, Son.

1427
01:07:20,731 --> 01:07:21,564
- Yes, sir.

1428
01:07:21,564 --> 01:07:22,793
- That's it, now go right
ahead with your work.

1429
01:07:23,852 --> 01:07:25,463

of business to do here.

Happy days are here again.

1436
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:58,640
- Don't you think you've
raised the prices too much?

1437
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:59,473
- Too much?

1438
01:07:59,473 --> 01:08:01,320
Why these people couldn't have a good time

1439
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:02,740
unless they paid too much.

1440
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:04,753
All right, boys, go to work.

1441
01:08:16,831 --> 01:08:18,206
- Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1442
01:08:18,206 --> 01:08:19,987
Step right up, play
ball, wherever you are.

1443
01:08:19,987 --> 01:08:21,585
Hurry, hurry, hurry, play ball.

1444
01:08:21,585 --> 01:08:23,833
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.

1445
01:08:24,765 --> 01:08:26,770
Oh, the little lady won
again, she won again.

1446
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:27,825
How is that?

1447
01:08:31,261 --> 01:08:33,112
Now two steps forward please.

1448
01:08:33,112 --> 01:08:34,477
Two steps backward.

1449
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:35,950
Now another one forward.

1450
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:37,608
Get away from me, Son, you're annoying me.

1451
01:08:37,608 --> 01:08:38,854
- Colonel, it's me.

1452
01:08:38,854 --> 01:08:40,200
- Well, Penguin, hello.

1453
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,033
- How's business?

1454
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:42,020
- Marvelous.

1455
01:08:42,853 --> 01:08:44,220
Well, how did that happen?

1456
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,798
Nevermind, step right this way folks

1457
01:08:45,798 --> 01:08:47,330
and we'll go through
the developing process.

1458
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:48,343
There you are.

1459
01:08:48,343 --> 01:08:50,337
Pass this through the little
nail, turn the little handle

1460
01:08:50,337 --> 01:08:52,306
and the photograph drops
in the little tank.

1461
01:08:52,306 --> 01:08:53,953
There's a charming portrait of yourself

1462
01:08:53,953 --> 01:08:55,430
and family, and the price is $5.

1463
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:56,910
- But it's blank.

1464
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:58,610
- That may surprise you,
but it doesn't surprise me.

1465
01:08:58,610 --> 01:08:59,970
The price remains the same.

1466
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:01,647
Thank you, do you mind
getting out of the way please?

1467
01:09:01,647 --> 01:09:03,634
How about that man over there?

1468
01:09:03,634 --> 01:09:05,944
There's a whole lotta taffy there.

1469
01:09:05,944 --> 01:09:07,092
- Having fun?

1470
01:09:07,092 --> 01:09:09,428
- Oh yes, and I appreciate you
letting me run the machine.

1471
01:09:09,428 --> 01:09:10,590
- Oh, that's all right.

1472
01:09:10,590 --> 01:09:12,668
Say, you can sell the
taffy too, if you like.

1473
01:09:12,668 --> 01:09:14,450
- May I? I'd be delighted.

1474
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:15,283
Toffee, toffee.

1475
01:09:15,283 --> 01:09:17,080
What do you
mean we ain't got none here?

1476
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:17,913
- The paddles are still
three for a dollar.

1477
01:09:17,913 --> 01:09:20,810
- A dollar, what, a
dollar for a 10-cent game.

1478
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:22,223
- Oh, Bob, come with me.

1479
01:09:24,397 --> 01:09:26,360
- Anybody else?

1480
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:27,760
Toffee, toffee.

1481
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,435
- Listen, buddy, you don't
have to get tough with me.

1482
01:09:29,435 --> 01:09:30,268
- Who's getting tough?

1483
01:09:30,268 --> 01:09:31,810
- Just a minute, I'm sorry, boys,

1484
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:34,396
but we're putting the show
on for a private party.

1485
01:09:34,396 --> 01:09:35,520
I'll have to ask you to leave.

1486
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:36,600
- Oh be nice, baby.

1487
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,097
You wouldn't want us to go now, would you?

1488
01:09:39,097 --> 01:09:41,100
- Oh, so it's one of those things.

1489
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:42,500
Okay, do it the hard way.

1490
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,080
- That's all I wanted to know.

1491
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,370
- All right, just a minute, wait a minute.

1492
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:48,861
You ain't heard the last of this.

1493
01:09:48,861 --> 01:09:50,141
- On your way.

1494
01:09:50,141 --> 01:09:51,757
- Here you are, ladies and gentlemen,

1495
01:09:51,757 --> 01:09:54,077
three strikes, one dollar, one dollar.

1496
01:09:54,077 --> 01:09:55,741
1,300, you can do better
than that, Mister.

1497
01:09:55,741 --> 01:09:56,849
Try it again, come on.

1498
01:09:56,849 --> 01:09:58,519
Three strikes for a dollar, folks.

1499
01:09:58,519 --> 01:09:59,887
- You'll never do it that way, Mister.

1500
01:09:59,887 --> 01:10:01,845
Stand back and I'll show you.

1501
01:10:01,845 --> 01:10:04,309
No muscles needed.

1502
01:10:06,031 --> 01:10:06,864
- Amazing.

1503
01:10:10,302 --> 01:10:14,385
- Introducing, the one,
the only, Fearless Drogo,

1504
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,699
daredevil of the arena.

1505
01:10:17,699 --> 01:10:19,452
- Fearless Drogo, huh?

1506
01:10:18,452 --> 01:10:20,111
- It couldn't be.

1507
01:10:20,111 --> 01:10:20,944
I wonder.

1508
01:10:22,179 --> 01:10:23,050
- Excuse me.

1509
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:25,430
- Think of it, folks, a mere $2.50.

1510
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,980
Here we go, folks,
don't rush, don't crowd.

1511
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:29,520
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1512
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,050
Come on, folks, and see
one of the best shows

1513
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:32,160
you ever saw in your life.

1514
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,780
- Get in there now and give
them everything you've got.

1515
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:35,740
- Listen, Penguin, you don't
know this, but I really--

1516
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,710
- No buts, this is your
chance to get back on top,

1517
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:38,543
and you're gonna take it.

1518
01:10:38,543 --> 01:10:39,376
- But I can--

1519
01:10:46,777 --> 01:10:49,527
- Hope everything goes all right.

1520
01:10:59,332 --> 01:11:00,165
- Hello.

1521
01:11:03,612 --> 01:11:04,793
Steady boy.

1522
01:11:06,691 --> 01:11:11,008
- Says here, when a lion
gets mad, he ripples up.

1523
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:12,767
He's mad.

1524
01:11:24,103 --> 01:11:25,760
- Well, well, Mr. Drogo
Gaines the millionaire playboy

1525
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,933
is more cuckoo than I thought he was.

1526
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:37,503
- Hey, Boss, that ain't in the book.

1527
01:11:40,813 --> 01:11:44,804
Look out, Mr. Drogo, here comes a lion.

1528
01:11:57,597 --> 01:12:00,197
A lion can run 40 miles an hour.

1529
01:12:00,197 --> 01:12:01,564
Sorry I read that.

1530
01:12:07,282 --> 01:12:10,630
- I told you I'd lead you
to the land of plenty.

1531
01:12:35,165 --> 01:12:36,007
- Willie?
- Yes'm.

1532
01:12:36,007 --> 01:12:38,836
- Get that lion back in the
cage before it scares someone.

1533
01:12:38,836 --> 01:12:41,513
- Put what lion in whose
cage before it scares who?

1534
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:45,660
- Racing here, racing
there, nowhere to go.

1535
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:46,730
What's going on in there?

1536
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:48,110
- A lion's loose.

1537
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:48,943
- Lion?

1538
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:53,295
- If I'm gonna hunt for lions,
I gotta get me some bait.

1539
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:56,721
Chasing lions all the time.

1540
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:02,860
He ain't there.

1541
01:13:02,860 --> 01:13:06,260
Kitty, kitty, sure hope I don't find him.

1542
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:07,859
Miss Moore sure gonna be mad

1543
01:13:07,859 --> 01:13:09,916
that lion chasing all them people.

1544
01:13:14,052 --> 01:13:15,733
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

1545
01:13:15,733 --> 01:13:17,823
Wonder where that lion is.

1546
01:13:36,973 --> 01:13:39,250
I pert near caught him that time.

1547
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:40,955
I gotta be more careful.

1548
01:13:43,530 --> 01:13:45,633
My blood pressure won't stand it.

1549
01:13:48,589 --> 01:13:50,256
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

1550
01:13:52,434 --> 01:13:53,459
Kitty, kitty.

1551
01:13:58,246 --> 01:13:59,336
Oh oh.

1552
01:14:07,891 --> 01:14:08,979
Kitty, kitty.

1553
01:14:08,979 --> 01:14:11,183
Come on, nice baloney, come on, kitty.

1554
01:14:11,183 --> 01:14:12,913
Kitty, kitty, nice baloney.

1555
01:14:15,518 --> 01:14:16,601
Get in there.

1556
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:22,250
Was that me talking?

1557
01:14:32,193 --> 01:14:35,040
- All right, folks,
everything's taken care of.

1558
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,981
Nothing to worry about.

1559
01:14:42,656 --> 01:14:44,923
- Toffee toffee, toffee
toffee, dollar a bag.

1560
01:14:44,923 --> 01:14:47,950
- Dollar a bag, we don't want no toffee.

1561
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:48,783
Come on, boys.

1562
01:14:49,627 --> 01:14:52,498
- Toffee toffee, it's awfully good.

1563
01:14:52,498 --> 01:14:54,209
- Angry mob.

1564
01:14:54,209 --> 01:14:55,513
Angry mob.

1565
01:14:55,513 --> 01:14:56,353
Angry mob.

1566
01:14:56,353 --> 01:14:58,353
- Angry mob.
- Angry mob.

1567
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,570
- Hi ya, beautiful.

1568
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:02,580
- Now listen, I told you
we're putting the show on

1569
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:03,790
for a private party.

1570
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:06,230
- Well this is my private
party, how about it, boys?

1571
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:07,920
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1572
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:09,647
- Wait a minute, you
heard what the lady said.

1573
01:15:09,647 --> 01:15:10,700
Now get going.

1574
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:12,733
- Oh glamor boy, huh?

1575
01:15:33,596 --> 01:15:34,763
- Hey, fellas!

1576
01:15:36,589 --> 01:15:38,373
Let's work this joint.

1577
01:15:47,991 --> 01:15:49,857
- Oh, they ain't playing.

1578
01:15:59,434 --> 01:16:00,767
- Toffee toffee.

1579
01:16:01,631 --> 01:16:03,454
Oh dear dear, this is special.

1580
01:16:03,454 --> 01:16:04,788
Toffee toffee.

1581
01:16:07,951 --> 01:16:09,380
Oh dear dear dear.

1582
01:16:12,163 --> 01:16:13,565
- Penguin, about that lion act.

1583
01:16:13,565 --> 01:16:14,643
- Skip it.

1584
01:16:14,643 --> 01:16:15,854
- You don't understand.

1585
01:16:15,854 --> 01:16:18,723
- I understand more than you think I do.

1586
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:23,728
- Take cover, lads.

1587
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:27,481
Now is the time for all good men

1588
01:16:27,481 --> 01:16:30,640
to come to the aid of their party.

1589
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:31,800
Don't shoot, boys, ooh.

1590
01:16:33,928 --> 01:16:36,549
Big bottles, eh, well come on.

1591
01:16:39,214 --> 01:16:40,297
- Sorry, kid!

1592
01:16:42,312 --> 01:16:43,639
- Oh.

1593
01:16:43,639 --> 01:16:45,222
- Ah, a bull's-eye.

1594
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:47,990
- Here here.

1595
01:16:56,321 --> 01:16:58,445
- Captain Drogo, reinforcements.

1596
01:17:05,857 --> 01:17:07,238
- Set.

1597
01:17:07,738 --> 01:17:08,571
Go!

1598
01:17:13,098 --> 01:17:14,714
That's good shooting, Orville.

1599
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:17,501
Okay, you take the high
road and I'll take the low.

1600
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:21,050
- Psst, Mr. Gaines.

1601
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:22,208
- What's on your mind?

1602
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:24,317
- I been looking all over for you.

1603
01:17:24,317 --> 01:17:27,911
I got the new carnival
parked in Portersville.

1604
01:17:27,911 --> 01:17:28,888
What shall I do with it?

1605
01:17:28,888 --> 01:17:29,964
- Go back and take care of it.

1606
01:17:29,964 --> 01:17:31,166
I'll get in touch with you later.

1607
01:17:31,166 --> 01:17:32,127
- Yes, sir.

1608
01:17:34,792 --> 01:17:36,946
- The situation is rolling.

1609
01:17:40,121 --> 01:17:41,204
A bull's-eye.

1610
01:17:43,667 --> 01:17:45,046
- Ow!

1611
01:17:52,169 --> 01:17:53,002
Out!

1612
01:18:04,504 --> 01:18:05,337
- Hey!

1613
01:18:11,631 --> 01:18:12,548
Help, help!

1614
01:18:15,499 --> 01:18:16,332
Help me!

1615
01:18:26,272 --> 01:18:27,333
- Let her go!

1616
01:18:34,636 --> 01:18:36,886
- Stand clear, stand clear!

1617
01:18:38,572 --> 01:18:40,989
- Oh, you've had enough, huh?

1618
01:18:51,113 --> 01:18:52,728
Sorry, Chief, sorry.

1619
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,933
Hey, victory is ours, ha ha.

1620
01:19:05,603 --> 01:19:08,300
- Victory is ours, but
my circus is ruined.

1621
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:09,510
- Well don't let that worry you.

1622
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:11,080
My rich nephew will pay for everything.

1623
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,746
Oh, Harry, Harry, where are you?

1624
01:19:13,746 --> 01:19:14,746
- Here I am.

1625
01:19:16,945 --> 01:19:17,778
Oh.

1626
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:21,326
Pardon my appearance.

1627
01:19:21,326 --> 01:19:22,760
Say, it's quite a disarray here.

1628
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,760
Well nevermind, I'll
have everything fixed.

1629
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,385
- There are you, what more can you ask?

1630
01:19:26,385 --> 01:19:27,500
- Meantime, let's celebrate by coming up

1631
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:28,920
to my house and having dinner.

1632
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:31,220
- Oh, I'd be delighted, but
I haven't a thing to wear.

1633
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:33,550
- Tut tut, the house is full of clothes.

1634
01:19:33,550 --> 01:19:34,470
May I?

1635
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:35,803
- Why certainly.

1636
01:19:40,623 --> 01:19:41,786
- An awful predicament.

1637
01:19:41,786 --> 01:19:42,910
The new carnival's over at Portersville.

1638
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:44,480
What am I going to do?

1639
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,320
- New carnival?
- Yes.

1640
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,900
- Good, good, now you run
along with the rest of them

1641
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:48,870
and leave everything to me.

1642
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:49,703
- Yeah, but I've got--

1643
01:19:49,703 --> 01:19:51,480
- Go right ahead now, don't you worry.

1644
01:19:54,492 --> 01:19:55,380
Say, George.

1645
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:56,220
- Yes, Colonel.

1646
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:58,730
- Do you still burn the
barn down every weekend?

1647
01:19:58,730 --> 01:19:59,563
- Yes, sir.

1648
01:19:59,563 --> 01:20:00,600
- Tonight?

1649
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:01,433
- Nine o'clock sharp.

1650
01:20:01,433 --> 01:20:03,200
- Fine, fine!

1651
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,470
Hey, boys, come here, quick.

1652
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:06,303
Hey, hey, hey.

1653
01:20:07,621 --> 01:20:09,530
Now wait a minute, I want
you to wrap up this carnival

1654
01:20:09,530 --> 01:20:12,590
and put it in that big barn
down the road about half a mile.

1655
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:14,716
Then I want you to all
go over to Portersville.

1656
01:20:14,716 --> 01:20:17,233
There's a new carnival over
there, bigger and better.

1657
01:20:17,233 --> 01:20:19,520
I want you to help set it up.

1658
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,600
Now come on, get going.

1659
01:20:29,210 --> 01:20:30,480
- Say, hello.

1660
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,880
- Penguin, you're beautiful.

1661
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:35,350
- Well, I'm charmed, Miss Moore.

1662
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:36,480
- Dinner is served, sir.

1663
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,460
- Thank you, Bates.

1664
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:39,917
Right this way, everyone,
for the victory dinner.

1665
01:20:40,955 --> 01:20:45,413
♪ Tell the pretty flower
your his long-lost cousin ♪

1666
01:20:45,413 --> 01:20:49,453
♪ When you promise me kisses ♪

1667
01:20:49,453 --> 01:20:54,070
♪ The filling in my sweet tooth aches ♪

1668
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:56,570
- Oh no, keep your hands off that chair.

1669
01:20:56,570 --> 01:20:58,340
I've had that one pulled on me before.

1670
01:20:58,340 --> 01:20:59,817
- As you wish, Madame.

1671
01:20:59,817 --> 01:21:00,650
- Thanks,

1672
01:21:06,271 --> 01:21:07,640
- You know, I'm awfully happy

1673
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,070
that they have chicken tonight.

1674
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:11,547
I never eat anything but chicken.

1675
01:21:12,730 --> 01:21:13,563
That's water.

1676
01:21:14,810 --> 01:21:16,571
One, two, three, four.

1677
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:20,507
A four-legged chicken.

1678
01:21:21,470 --> 01:21:23,727
That's cute, a four-legged
chicken.

1679
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:30,631
- Three-legged chicken.

1680
01:21:30,631 --> 01:21:33,298
- A three-legged chicken,
there's a novelty,

1681
01:21:33,298 --> 01:21:35,825
a three-legged chicken.

1682
01:21:35,825 --> 01:21:36,910
What's the idea?

1683
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:38,652
- Oh, you wouldn't like
that, that's no good.

1684
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:42,683
- Well here we are, back to normal again.

1685
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,740
That's kinda muscular, isn't it, huh?

1686
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:49,170
- It's nearly nine o'clock, sir.

1687
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:50,880
- Oh, so it is, Bates.

1688
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:51,713
Shuffled well?

1689
01:21:51,713 --> 01:21:52,669
- Yes, sir.

1690
01:21:52,669 --> 01:21:54,760
- All right, everyone, let's
hurry with the usual drawing

1691
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,310
for positions on the firetrucks,

1692
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:57,913
to see who the lucky people are.

1693
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,362
Will you draw, Uncle Carleton?

1694
01:21:59,362 --> 01:22:00,690
- Yes.

1695
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:01,523
Mine's a blank.

1696
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:03,580
- Better luck next time.

1697
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,870
- I drive the chemical truck.

1698
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:06,703
- That's nice.

1699
01:22:06,703 --> 01:22:08,240
I'll just
ride along with Mr. Gaines.

1700
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:10,230
- Why, Colonel, this is not a blank.

1701
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:12,680
You too ride on the chemical wagon.

1702
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:14,590
- By the way, Harry, what
are you burning tonight?

1703
01:22:14,590 --> 01:22:15,610
- The same old barn.

1704
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:17,130
- Oh, that's terrible.

1705
01:22:17,130 --> 01:22:18,670
- What's the matter, Uncle Carleton.

1706
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:19,503
- How was I to know that you're still

1707
01:22:19,503 --> 01:22:21,270
burning the same old barn.

1708
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,110
In order to save the
carnival from the hoodlums,

1709
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:24,740
I had the boys hide it in the barn.

1710
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:26,210
- You mean the carnival's on fire?

1711
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:27,270
- I mean exactly that.

1712
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:28,710
- My carnival.

1713
01:22:45,716 --> 01:22:47,269
- Don't you think I oughta
be doing the driving?

1714
01:22:47,269 --> 01:22:49,833
- Don't be silly, I been pushing
trucks around all my life.

1715
01:22:49,833 --> 01:22:51,444
- Tally ho.

1716
01:23:09,807 --> 01:23:11,974
Certainly is exhilarating.

1717
01:23:15,187 --> 01:23:16,243
- Where is the fire?

1718
01:23:16,243 --> 01:23:19,070
- Nevermind the fire,
we're not going there.

1719
01:23:19,070 --> 01:23:20,254
- What do you mean?

1720
01:23:20,254 --> 01:23:22,513
- Keep going straight
ahead, and we'll lead them

1721
01:23:22,513 --> 01:23:24,370
into Portersville and the new carnival.

1722
01:23:24,370 --> 01:23:25,922
- What about the fire?

1723
01:23:25,922 --> 01:23:28,450
- You told me to get rid of
her carnival, didn't you?

1724
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:30,977
Maybe when she sees the new
one she'll forget the old one.

1725
01:23:30,977 --> 01:23:31,810
- Oh.

1726
01:23:41,178 --> 01:23:42,182
- Low bridge!

1727
01:24:09,696 --> 01:24:10,946
- Take it easy.

1728
01:24:14,075 --> 01:24:15,075
Oh, stop it.

1729
01:24:16,088 --> 01:24:19,661
Somebody's going to be
hurt, and it'll be me.

1730
01:24:23,753 --> 01:24:25,143
Hey.

1731
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:25,976
Move over.

1732
01:24:27,027 --> 01:24:28,167
Hey!

1733
01:24:39,389 --> 01:24:42,389
- Get off the road, that's not fair.

1734
01:24:43,649 --> 01:24:44,482
- Ah!

1735
01:24:45,565 --> 01:24:46,530
Oh!

1736
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:58,699
Hey, let's move it.

1737
01:24:58,699 --> 01:25:00,616
Please, fellas, please.

1738
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:09,252
Oh now, what'll I do?

1739
01:25:10,347 --> 01:25:11,180
Hey!

1740
01:25:12,797 --> 01:25:14,952
- Pretty tricky.

1741
01:25:14,952 --> 01:25:17,167
- Hey, get me outta here!

1742
01:25:17,167 --> 01:25:19,029
- Do something, get her down.

1743
01:25:19,029 --> 01:25:19,862
- Oh yes.

1744
01:25:23,082 --> 01:25:23,915
- Hey!

1745
01:25:39,283 --> 01:25:41,741
- Well, here we are.

1746
01:25:41,741 --> 01:25:44,093
Gaze upon it, it's beautiful,

1747
01:25:44,093 --> 01:25:47,388
wonderful and all for the love of a girl.

1748
01:25:47,388 --> 01:25:48,661
The World's Fair on Wheels.

1749
01:25:48,661 --> 01:25:50,892
I couldn't have picked
a better one myself.

1750
01:25:52,892 --> 01:25:56,898
- Aw, it's beautiful, Moore and Gaines.

1751
01:25:56,898 --> 01:25:58,537
That's you and me.

1752
01:25:58,537 --> 01:25:59,894
Do you really mean it?

1753
01:25:59,894 --> 01:26:01,614
- Yes, for keeps.

1754
01:26:01,614 --> 01:26:03,375
- Boy, a lollapalooza.

1755
01:26:05,902 --> 01:26:07,069
Well, so long.

1756
01:26:11,959 --> 01:26:15,236
Hey, maybe you got something there.
