<i>How did I see it,
when nobody else did?</i>

3
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,434
<i>I don't know.</i>

4
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:45,568
<i>How did that guy invent
the light bulb?</i>

5
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,042
<i>Sometimes, it just comes
to you.</i>

6
00:00:53,813 --> 00:00:58,815
<i>Whatever it was, I saw an
untapped market...</i>

7
00:00:58,817 --> 00:01:03,724
<i>and, well... I tapped it.</i>

8
00:01:07,327 --> 00:01:11,430
<i>And it was all going so great.</i>

9
00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:15,466
<i>And then, of course, like
everything else in my life...</i>

10
00:01:15,468 --> 00:01:18,572
<i>it all went to shit.</i>

11
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:22,543
<i>Hm...</i>

12
00:01:23,843 --> 00:01:28,483
<i>Tide comes in... tide goes out.</i>

13
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:35,755
<i>Look, I've done some shitty
things in my life.</i>

14
00:01:35,757 --> 00:01:39,791
<i>But this... I don't think
it's one of them.</i>

15
00:01:39,793 --> 00:01:44,097
<i>Well, let me back it up a bit,
though.</i>

16
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:49,236
<i>I'm a bookie, well, if you're
from the IRS, I hang sheetrock.</i>

17
00:01:49,238 --> 00:01:52,506
<i>But, you know, if you're
looking to put action...</i>

18
00:01:52,508 --> 00:01:54,408
<i>on a game, I'm your guy.</i>

19
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:58,178
<i>The difference between me
and a Las Vegas casino...</i>

20
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,647
<i>is that in Vegas, you gotta pay
before you bet.</i>

21
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,251
<i>But with me, you bet
on credit...</i>

22
00:02:05,253 --> 00:02:09,692
<i>which means there's a certain
code of honor.</i>

23
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:15,864
<i>And when people disrespect
that code, well...</i>

24
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:18,432
<i>sometimes I gotta make
consequences for that shit.</i>

25
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:28,779
Oh...

26
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:39,754
There you go.

27
00:02:39,756 --> 00:02:41,490
<i>When two teams play
each other...</i>

28
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:44,292
<i>I have to set what's called
the line.</i>

29
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:47,529
<i>The line is this, how many
points do I think...</i>

30
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:51,166
<i>Team A will beat Team B by,
so that the bet...</i>

31
00:02:51,168 --> 00:02:53,169
<i>is as fairly balanced
as possible...</i>

32
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:57,405
<i>and that's what I want, because
I make my money off the vig.</i>

33
00:02:57,407 --> 00:03:00,777
<i>Now the vig is basically a tax
on each bet...</i>

34
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:02,812
<i>for services rendered.</i>

35
00:03:02,814 --> 00:03:06,783
<i>I assume the risk and
ten percent is my reward.</i>

36
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:09,586
<i>Now, this business model works
assuming you get paid.</i>

37
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:16,525
<i>Sometimes though, I have
to improvise.</i>

38
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:39,382
<i>This is my office.</i>

39
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:41,986
<i>This is my secretary.</i>

40
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:45,488
- Hey-oh!
- Hey, you!

41
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,225
Thank you, Beaches.

42
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,165
You mind backin' up these fine
gentlemen for me, as well.

43
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,532
- Guys!
- Hey, all right! Tha' man.

44
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,368
Here's your mail.

45
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,869
<i>In these envelopes,
well, they're my cash flow...</i>

46
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,404
That's all of it?

47
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,006
Well, not a lot of guys came
through this week.

48
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:03,507
Well, maybe if you were a little
more cordial to people...

49
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,910
Maybe if you go fuck yourself.

50
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,446
Okay, maybe not. There you go.

51
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,580
<i>If I collect more
envelopes than I hand out...</i>

52
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,681
<i>then I had a good week.</i>

53
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,418
Snips, what's the good word?

54
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,819
All right, Alphons.

55
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:16,289
<i>There are a few
different types of gamblers.</i>

56
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,892
<i>You have your average gambler,
consistent guy bets every week.</i>

57
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:22,561
<i>Your sparse gambler, calls
every so often...</i>

58
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:25,498
<i>when he gets the bug or maybe
someone gives him a tip.</i>

59
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,734
<i>Then you have your whale,
he bets big.</i>

60
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:31,537
<i>Always pays on time and if you
keep him around long enough...</i>

61
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,407
<i>you can make enough money on
the vig to buy a new truck...</i>

62
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:35,575
<i>in the off season.</i>

63
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:37,043
Another good week, Mickey.

64
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:38,612
Tell me you're not giving all my
hard-earned money...

65
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:40,047
to these dirt bags.

66
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:41,814
You kidding? The only reason
I hang out with them...

67
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:43,550
is because they're lousy poker
players.

68
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:45,785
<i>For every whale...</i>

69
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:47,821
Steve, how'd you do last night?

70
00:04:47,823 --> 00:04:49,555
I got screwed.

71
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:51,591
<i>There's at least
ten hard-luck cases.</i>

72
00:04:51,593 --> 00:04:53,694
Look, Maryland's down by 12,
they're getting ten.

73
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:56,396
There's no time left on the
clock. The scrubs are in.

74
00:04:56,398 --> 00:04:59,933
All they got to do is run out
the clock, right? Hold the ball.

75
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:04,673
Bench-warming cocksucker shoots
a meaningless three ball.

76
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:08,043
They lose by nine, backdoor
cover... they fucked me!

77
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:09,878
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna
let you slide...

78
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,846
on that bet last night.

79
00:05:10,848 --> 00:05:12,681
But next time you hit a backdoor
cover on me...

80
00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:14,416
I don't want to see you coming
in here and gloatin'...

81
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:15,582
in front of everybody,
all right?

82
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:17,818
I would never.

83
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,621
<i>Look, I'll be honest,
I don't mind the hard luck cases.</i>

84
00:05:20,623 --> 00:05:25,026
<i>What I can't put up with are
the dirt bag motherfuckers...</i>

85
00:05:25,028 --> 00:05:26,862
<i>who don't pay up and walk
around town...</i>

86
00:05:26,864 --> 00:05:29,665
<i>like they don't owe you money.</i>

87
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,634
Adam Kramer.

88
00:05:31,636 --> 00:05:34,369
Hey, what's going on?

89
00:05:34,371 --> 00:05:37,739
- How are you?
- I'm great, how you doing?

90
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:41,110
Good. New TV?

91
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:45,013
Huh? Yeah, this is uh,
brand-new for Mark Rigney...

92
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:48,017
who said, "These suckers are
flying off the shelves...

93
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:49,553
"will you grab me one before
they're all gone?"

94
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:50,986
And I said, "You betcha, bud."

95
00:05:50,988 --> 00:05:53,589
So I bought this for Mark Rigney
and he'll pay me back.

96
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:55,659
- Need a hand?
- Yeah.

97
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:58,361
No, I'm good, I'm good.
I got it, I got it.

98
00:05:58,363 --> 00:06:01,630
- Not a problem.
- I appreciate that, thank you.

99
00:06:01,632 --> 00:06:02,899
- Thank you.
- Wow.

100
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:04,567
- I know.
- What kind of TV is that?

101
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:09,606
Uh, 55-inch, picture-in-picture,
1080i, LED.

102
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:12,542
- Curved screen.
- Curved screen.

103
00:06:12,544 --> 00:06:13,910
Huh, here, let me give
you a hand.

104
00:06:13,912 --> 00:06:15,946
Okay, thanks. It's just
that the door...

105
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:17,948
- Can you wiggle it? There.
- There you go.

106
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,383
- Thanks.
- All you gotta do is lean it.

107
00:06:19,385 --> 00:06:23,421
I know, so, just wiggle it...
a bit.

108
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:25,459
Oh, oh, careful.

109
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,527
- All right, there you go.
- Okay, thanks.

110
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:32,332
- You got it?
- Yeah.

111
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:37,872
Tell Mark I said enjoy
his new TV, huh?

112
00:06:43,177 --> 00:06:46,177
I'll have an envelope for you
by the end of the week.

113
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:47,812
I'll leave it at Joanne's.

114
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:52,684
All right, see ya', Kramer.

115
00:06:55,555 --> 00:06:57,689
<i>When half the town
owes you money...</i>

116
00:06:57,691 --> 00:07:00,429
<i>nobody's happy to see you.</i>

117
00:07:01,596 --> 00:07:03,863
<i>Well, guess what,
motherfuckers?</i>

118
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:08,767
<i>I ain't happy to see you
either, but you got my money.</i>

119
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:13,205
<i>I got mouths to feed.</i>

120
00:07:13,207 --> 00:07:16,208
Oh, finally. Where you been?

121
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:20,712
I got hung up. Here you go.

122
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:22,917
Ah, thanks.

123
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:27,855
Aw, god, they've got the onions
in it...

124
00:07:27,857 --> 00:07:31,057
- What?
- Onions, it's got onions.

125
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:33,463
Oh, maybe I got yours, hang on.

126
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:36,864
Aw, fuck me, man!

127
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:38,598
Did you check before you left?

128
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,100
You always gotta check,
they fuck up.

129
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:41,735
What do you want me to say, Dad?

130
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:44,771
- You want me to take it back?
- No, I'm starving, leave it.

131
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:46,607
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

132
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:47,808
Where are the groceries?

133
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,844
I didn't have time. I'll get
them tomorrow.

134
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:52,680
Smokes?

135
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:55,118
Here, take mine.

136
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,690
- Only five in here.
- Let me see.

137
00:08:02,058 --> 00:08:04,494
Four, make them last.

138
00:08:05,995 --> 00:08:07,796
I'm almost out of beer.

139
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:09,498
Duly noted, anything else?

140
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,235
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
my TV is acting up.

141
00:08:13,237 --> 00:08:15,170
Oh, why don't I go out and get
you one of those...

142
00:08:15,172 --> 00:08:17,773
new, curved screen ones,
you want that?

143
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:19,708
You asked, so I told you.

144
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,775
I got to run.

145
00:08:20,777 --> 00:08:22,177
You just got here.

146
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:23,912
Yeah, well it's almost an hour
before tip off...

147
00:08:23,914 --> 00:08:25,047
and I got shit to do.

148
00:08:25,049 --> 00:08:25,915
How's the action?

149
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:29,585
Sparse.

150
00:08:29,587 --> 00:08:31,888
How much money you still got out
from football.

151
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,791
A lot. I don't... I don't want
to fucking hear it...

152
00:08:35,793 --> 00:08:37,728
because you didn't have to deal
with the internet like I do.

153
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,830
You offer something the internet
can't, the human connection.

154
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:42,299
Well, it's not like a lot
of people are trying...

155
00:08:42,301 --> 00:08:43,633
to do right by me right now.

156
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:45,035
Well, you've gotta convince
them.

157
00:08:45,037 --> 00:08:46,136
Dad, if I go around breaking
fingers...

158
00:08:46,138 --> 00:08:47,804
no one's gonna bet through me.

159
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:50,541
You don't have to break fingers.
You just gotta be more firm.

160
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:52,309
- Okay, I got it.
- You're too soft, you let peopl...

161
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:53,676
I got it, thanks for the advice.

162
00:08:53,678 --> 00:08:54,945
- What are you going to do?
- I apprec...

163
00:08:54,947 --> 00:08:56,079
Show your face around town...

164
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:57,547
guilt people into paying
you back?

165
00:08:57,549 --> 00:08:59,116
- Do you want your book back?
- No.

166
00:08:59,118 --> 00:09:01,219
All right, then don't fucking
worry about it.

167
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:02,987
- God dang!
- Jesus Christ.

168
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:08,825
<i>Some dads leave
their son's a family business.</i>

169
00:09:08,827 --> 00:09:13,733
<i>My dad, he left me a book full
of degenerate gamblers.</i>

170
00:09:16,702 --> 00:09:19,037
<i>This time of year, with no
football...</i>

171
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,805
<i>and basketball winding down.</i>

172
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:25,711
<i>I become a little
more... vulnerable.</i>

173
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:28,246
<i>One big bet can be more
costly than a fucking divorce.</i>

174
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:31,082
Let's see, I got Philly plus
five, $194.

175
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:33,652
Brooklyn minus seven. $200.

176
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:40,028
Okay. Yup. Philly for ten.
You mean a grand, right?

177
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:43,262
Oh, you mean ten grand.

178
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:47,298
Um, yeah. Hang on a second
thing.

179
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,236
<i>I can't afford
to lose my whale.</i>

180
00:09:50,238 --> 00:09:52,271
<i>I know I can take him over
the long haul...</i>

181
00:09:52,273 --> 00:09:56,811
<i>but when funds are low and he
wants to bet big... shit.</i>

182
00:09:57,878 --> 00:10:00,145
Mick, you still there?

183
00:10:00,147 --> 00:10:03,649
Yeah, I can take five.

184
00:10:03,651 --> 00:10:07,319
No, Mick, you don't want
to do that.

185
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:13,059
You bet online, you gotta pay
taxes on that shit.

186
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:15,164
No, Mick, I know you always pay.

187
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:22,169
Okay, alright, 10 grand
on Philly.

188
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:24,273
Good luck.

189
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:36,788
He wants Philly. Fuck it,
Cornwall never plays defense.

190
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:42,958
Cornwall picks this game
to start playing defense.

191
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,095
How much you in for?

192
00:10:45,428 --> 00:10:47,996
- My Lexus.
- Damn.

193
00:10:47,998 --> 00:10:50,331
I need income, Scotty.

194
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:52,934
- How's your union card?
- Up to date.

195
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:55,070
Want to hang some sheet rock?

196
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,075
Do I want to or will I?

197
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:01,744
Petey, give me a beer.

198
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:06,085
You know what, knock these guys
up too, will ya'?

199
00:11:07,184 --> 00:11:09,121
Big spender.

200
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,687
Cheers.

201
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:13,056
- You don't want it?
- Nope.

202
00:11:13,058 --> 00:11:17,261
- A free drink.
- I know that.

203
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:25,168
What's going on over there?

204
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,803
He says he don't want it.

205
00:11:26,805 --> 00:11:28,371
What do you mean, he don't
want it?

206
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:30,474
He don't want the drink.

207
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:33,811
Hey, John, what's the matter
with you, take the drink.

208
00:11:33,813 --> 00:11:35,881
Thanks, but no thanks.

209
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:57,268
You're embarrassing me in
front of my friend, Zibs.

210
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,036
Just take a drink.

211
00:11:59,038 --> 00:12:00,674
I don't want it.

212
00:12:02,876 --> 00:12:05,744
I know I owe you money,
I'm gonna pay you.

213
00:12:05,746 --> 00:12:07,812
I don't see why you can't accept
my drink.

214
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:10,414
When you pay me and we're all
square...

215
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,383
then you can buy me a drink, how
about that?

216
00:12:12,385 --> 00:12:14,252
I don't see what the difference
two bucks makes, man.

217
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:15,920
Andy, he doesn't want the drink.

218
00:12:15,922 --> 00:12:17,489
Hey, Scotty, shut the fuck up,
I'm not talking to you.

219
00:12:17,491 --> 00:12:19,791
Hey, hey, guys, just calm it
down, all right?

220
00:12:19,793 --> 00:12:21,260
I'll take it.

221
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:24,997
No, you're not taking a drink,
buy your own fucking drink.

222
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:26,368
Take the drink.

223
00:12:28,101 --> 00:12:30,902
You bought a truck.

224
00:12:30,904 --> 00:12:35,006
Yeah, yeah, the old one was
falling apart.

225
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:36,309
It's a brand-new truck.

226
00:12:36,311 --> 00:12:37,878
Johnny, I'm a contractor.

227
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,445
How am I supposed to work
without a new truck?

228
00:12:39,447 --> 00:12:43,215
If I can't work, I can't pay
you.

229
00:12:43,217 --> 00:12:46,253
And I got a good deal.

230
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:47,820
What are you, my accountant?

231
00:12:47,822 --> 00:12:50,860
No, I just don't want
your fucking drink.

232
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:55,561
Fine. Fine.

233
00:12:55,563 --> 00:12:59,202
You know what, don't take
my fucking drink.

234
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,070
Whoa! Fuck.

235
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:05,105
I'm leaving, I'm leaving,
I know. I know. I know.

236
00:13:05,107 --> 00:13:07,508
You should have taken the
fucking drink, douche bag.

237
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,344
It was as simple as that.
I was trying to be a nice guy.

238
00:13:10,346 --> 00:13:11,845
Fuck off!

239
00:13:11,847 --> 00:13:14,916
Zibs, I'm sorry, man, you all
right?

240
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:17,018
Aw, that guy is such a dick,
I'm sorry, man.

241
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,454
Yeah... shit.

242
00:13:20,456 --> 00:13:24,025
Listen, I wanted to talk to you
about something, anyway.

243
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:26,995
Um, I was wondering
if maybe you could...

244
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:29,501
uh, maybe not come in here
for awhile.

245
00:13:31,502 --> 00:13:33,367
I get punched in the face...

246
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:35,370
and you're kicking <i>me</i> out
of the bar?

247
00:13:35,372 --> 00:13:37,405
No, it's just that I got a kid,
you know...

248
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,841
and everyone in town owes
you money...

249
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:41,577
and you know, everyone knows
you come in here...

250
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,144
and if they're avoiding you...

251
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:45,282
then they ain't coming in here,
you know.

252
00:13:47,185 --> 00:13:48,318
Fuck you, Petey.

253
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,852
No, let me buy you a round,
okay?

254
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:51,956
I don't want your fucking
drinks, neither.

255
00:13:57,528 --> 00:13:59,431
That's ten grand.

256
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:04,534
It's only money.

257
00:14:04,536 --> 00:14:08,007
Tide comes in, tide goes out.

258
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:20,450
Is that Debbie Houston?

259
00:14:20,452 --> 00:14:22,619
Yeah, she works here.

260
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:26,323
We messed around in high school.

261
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:30,194
You know she married Hooper? Had
a kid together.

262
00:14:30,196 --> 00:14:33,030
Just got divorced a little while
back.

263
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:35,300
Man, she used to party, man.

264
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:38,538
Shit, looks like she still does.

265
00:14:44,211 --> 00:14:49,580
Is that John Zbikowski?

266
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:51,918
And fucking Scotty?

267
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:57,656
I haven't seen you since
high school.

268
00:14:57,658 --> 00:15:01,560
Do you remember me,
Debbie Houston?

269
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:03,999
We fucked, you better.

270
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:07,933
- Buy me a drink.
- Fine.

271
00:15:07,935 --> 00:15:12,039
Wally, three whiskey shots,
right here.

272
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:16,942
So what are you two up to?

273
00:15:16,944 --> 00:15:20,546
You were really good
at baseball, right?

274
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:23,616
Yeah, I was okay.

275
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:26,285
- Weren't you drafted?
- Yup.

276
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:28,187
What happened?

277
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:30,222
I had this thing with my arm.

278
00:15:30,224 --> 00:15:32,591
No, to your face?

279
00:15:32,593 --> 00:15:35,562
Oh, I got punched.

280
00:15:35,564 --> 00:15:38,197
I can see that, why?

281
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:41,168
Somebody owed me money.

282
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,338
Somebody owed you money and
<i>you</i> got punched in the face?

283
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,541
Yep.

284
00:15:47,543 --> 00:15:50,078
I'd love to owe you money.

285
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,949
Get in line.

286
00:15:53,215 --> 00:15:55,418
To owing you money.

287
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:04,961
Time really did a number on us,
didn't it?

288
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:10,700
Would you still fuck me?

289
00:16:40,664 --> 00:16:43,535
- Hey.
- Hey.

290
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,485
Hey, you know if you have
any coffee?

291
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,820
Nope.

292
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,554
Nope, you don't have any
coffee...

293
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,489
or nope, you don't know
if you have any coffee?

294
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:08,359
Nope, I don't know
if we have any.

295
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,592
All right, fair enough.

296
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:12,562
Are you friends with my mom?

297
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,800
We went to high school together.

298
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,467
Oh.

299
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,571
- You know where she is?
- Work.

300
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,507
She just leaves you by yourself?

301
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,576
My grandmom comes over
sometimes.

302
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:27,581
Is this one of those times?

303
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,351
Are you allowed to stay home by
herself?

304
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,620
I think so.

305
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,656
- How old are you?
- 12.

306
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:40,257
That's a gray area.

307
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,826
Can we call her?

308
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:46,130
When she's at work I can only
call her if it's an emergency.

309
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,266
Just an emergency?

310
00:17:47,268 --> 00:17:49,267
Only if I'm bleeding.

311
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51,771
Shit, man.

312
00:17:51,773 --> 00:17:53,872
All right, look, okay,
I'm gonna be honest with you.

313
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:56,208
I have no idea if I told your
mom that I was gonna watch...

314
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,781
you or not, so what do you think
we should do here?

315
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:07,519
So what? You go to school?

316
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:10,523
- Yep.
- Good.

317
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:12,526
Well, we're done for the summer.

318
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:15,595
Oh right, yeah.

319
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:16,729
What are you gonna do
with yourself?

320
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:18,498
I don't know.

321
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,467
Might want to figure that out
before school starts back up.

322
00:18:20,469 --> 00:18:26,472
Yeah, I play baseball.

323
00:18:26,474 --> 00:18:28,674
- At Dundalk?
- Yep.

324
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:30,410
You any good?

325
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:32,778
I'm gonna play pro one day.

326
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,119
Settin' the bar pretty high.

327
00:19:06,651 --> 00:19:09,451
Say hi to my friend real quick,
okay? I'll be right back.

328
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:10,856
Okay.

329
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:25,468
Hey, if you see anyone pull up out
here, you honk the horn, okay?

330
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,373
Okay.

331
00:20:23,563 --> 00:20:26,564
Thanks for breakfast.

332
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:29,667
Hey, kid, do you want this TV?

333
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:31,936
You sure you don't want this?

334
00:20:31,938 --> 00:20:36,341
You hold onto it for me. Think
of it as hush money.

335
00:20:36,343 --> 00:20:38,278
What does that mean?

336
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,546
It means you gotta promise not
to tell anyone how we got this.

337
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:42,682
Can you do that?

338
00:20:42,684 --> 00:20:44,283
Sure.

339
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,985
Promise me you are not going
to tell your friends.

340
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:50,555
- I promise.
- Okay, good.

341
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:52,425
What should I tell my mom?

342
00:20:52,427 --> 00:20:54,860
Tell her I got a new one
and gave you my old one.

343
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:56,462
But this is a brand-new TV.

344
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:57,696
Kid, do you want the TV or not?

345
00:20:57,698 --> 00:20:59,399
- I want it.
- All right.

346
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:02,271
Then figure something out,
just don't tell her we stole it.

347
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:08,374
I got a game tomorrow at 5:00,
if you want to come.

348
00:21:08,376 --> 00:21:09,409
At Dundalk.

349
00:21:09,411 --> 00:21:12,612
Yep. Coach is gonna let me
pitch.

350
00:21:12,614 --> 00:21:15,815
Hmm. You ever pitched before?

351
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:19,620
Not in a real game.

352
00:21:19,622 --> 00:21:21,988
Yeah, I'll be there, later.

353
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,493
See ya'.

354
00:22:34,532 --> 00:22:37,634
<i>Kids are basically
hard-luck cases.</i>

355
00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:43,441
<i>They're on the take 24/7.</i>

356
00:22:43,443 --> 00:22:45,175
<i>You do something nice for them,
like...</i>

357
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:47,745
<i>give the kid a brand-new TV.</i>

358
00:22:47,747 --> 00:22:49,614
<i>Instead of a thank you...</i>

359
00:22:49,616 --> 00:22:52,682
<i>it's can you come to my
baseball game?</i>

360
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:04,695
<i>Sometimes I think about what
it would be like...</i>

361
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:08,099
<i>to be free of hard-luck cases.</i>

362
00:23:08,101 --> 00:23:11,068
<i>To only have one mouth
to feed.</i>

363
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,141
Did you get my smokes?

364
00:23:16,577 --> 00:23:18,079
Yeah, I got 'em.

365
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:31,127
Look alive, outfield!
Come on now.

366
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:48,576
Come on, Frankie, what are
you doing out there?

367
00:23:48,578 --> 00:23:50,013
Pay attention!

368
00:23:55,751 --> 00:23:59,752
<i>Parents, they see their
kids with rose-colored glasses.</i>

369
00:23:59,754 --> 00:24:03,193
<i>They think they're much better
than they actually are.</i>

370
00:24:04,894 --> 00:24:09,163
Zibs? John Zbikowski?

371
00:24:09,165 --> 00:24:12,501
It's me, Matt Smith, Smitty?

372
00:24:12,503 --> 00:24:16,170
- From like forever ago?
- Smitty, how are you?

373
00:24:16,172 --> 00:24:19,773
Wow, it really literally
has been forever.

374
00:24:19,775 --> 00:24:21,609
What have you been up to?

375
00:24:21,611 --> 00:24:25,917
- You know, just getting along.
- Oh, that's great, that's great.

376
00:24:26,984 --> 00:24:28,849
You used to play pro ball,
didn't you?

377
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:31,785
- Yep.
- For the...

378
00:24:31,787 --> 00:24:33,288
- Atlanta.
- Atlanta...

379
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,658
oh, wow, that's amazing.

380
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,994
You got a kid in the league?

381
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:41,062
No, no kids.

382
00:24:41,064 --> 00:24:42,631
Yeah, I figured.

383
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:46,034
I would have recognized your
name from the roster sheet.

384
00:24:46,036 --> 00:24:47,570
Roster sheet?

385
00:24:47,572 --> 00:24:49,938
Yeah, we send out roster sheets
to all the parents...

386
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,840
got a list of all the kids'
names.

387
00:24:51,842 --> 00:24:55,144
It's always fun to go through
it, figure out, you know...

388
00:24:55,146 --> 00:24:58,814
which parents you know from
school, catch up.

389
00:24:58,816 --> 00:25:02,553
Plus, I am the league
commissioner this year, so...

390
00:25:02,555 --> 00:25:08,091
Really? Maybe we could do
something about that scoreboard.

391
00:25:08,093 --> 00:25:11,828
Well, I am running
for city council, so, uh...

392
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:15,232
if I'm elected, maybe I could do
something about that.

393
00:25:15,234 --> 00:25:17,668
If you still living in the
city, you should vote for me.

394
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,869
I don't vote.

395
00:25:18,871 --> 00:25:20,003
Really? Everyone should vote.

396
00:25:20,005 --> 00:25:23,240
- Okay, you convinced me.
- Great!

397
00:25:23,242 --> 00:25:24,842
Oh, hey, honey, honey...

398
00:25:24,844 --> 00:25:27,711
come here, there's somebody
I want you to meet! This...

399
00:25:27,713 --> 00:25:28,880
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

400
00:25:28,882 --> 00:25:32,984
Is John Zbikowski, Zibs, best
baseball player I ever saw.

401
00:25:32,986 --> 00:25:34,986
- Hello?
- Hi.

402
00:25:34,988 --> 00:25:37,121
He got drafted into the pros.

403
00:25:37,123 --> 00:25:39,125
Whoa, that's fantastic!

404
00:25:43,229 --> 00:25:46,765
His dad was really something,
he used to make you throw...

405
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:49,000
what, like 100 pitches a day
or something?

406
00:25:49,002 --> 00:25:50,702
Something like that.

407
00:25:50,704 --> 00:25:54,105
Can you imagine me making Mikey
throw 100 pitches a day.

408
00:25:54,107 --> 00:25:55,607
He would run away from home.

409
00:25:55,609 --> 00:25:58,209
- And call child services.
- Yeah.

410
00:25:58,211 --> 00:26:00,379
Oh, I can still hear your
dad yelling from the stands.

411
00:26:00,381 --> 00:26:03,585
- Put it in the glove!
- Yeah.

412
00:26:08,756 --> 00:26:12,758
I never got who you're out here
to see.

413
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,126
Brian Houston.

414
00:26:14,128 --> 00:26:17,029
Debbie's boy. You remember
Debbie from high school?

415
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:18,931
Yeah, you know her?

416
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:24,037
No, just, um, I recognize her
name from the roster sheet.

417
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:26,139
Well, enjoy the game.

418
00:26:26,141 --> 00:26:28,274
If you ever want to come out
and give the boys...

419
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:29,909
some pointers, that'd be great.

420
00:26:29,911 --> 00:26:31,244
I don't play baseball anymore.

421
00:26:31,246 --> 00:26:35,318
Right, well, we'll see you
around the park.

422
00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:02,109
I threw strikes in practice.

423
00:27:02,111 --> 00:27:04,413
I'm sure you did.

424
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:06,815
That's probably my last shot
at pitching.

425
00:27:06,817 --> 00:27:10,085
Eh, there's more to life than
playing baseball.

426
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,819
I was a pitcher.

427
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:14,690
I got my name on the wall out
there and look at me now.

428
00:27:14,692 --> 00:27:18,225
You're on the Wall of Fame?

429
00:27:18,227 --> 00:27:21,696
I want to be on that wall more
than anything.

430
00:27:21,698 --> 00:27:24,402
I think you gotta throw strikes
to get on that wall, kid.

431
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:30,373
Hey, I can give you some
pointers, you know...

432
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,308
if you're interested.

433
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,310
- Seriously?
- Sure.

434
00:27:35,312 --> 00:27:38,783
Need a ride? Come on.

435
00:27:43,987 --> 00:27:46,925
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yup.

436
00:27:51,496 --> 00:27:56,168
Hey, kid... you got one of them
roster sheets?

437
00:27:57,937 --> 00:28:00,002
So you know all these
players pretty well.

438
00:28:00,004 --> 00:28:01,370
Sure.

439
00:28:01,372 --> 00:28:03,406
All right, tomorrow,
Eagle-Spartans, who wins?

440
00:28:03,408 --> 00:28:06,143
Eagles easily, Ryan Hosfeld
is pitching.

441
00:28:06,145 --> 00:28:07,277
And the Spartans aren't very
good?

442
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:08,811
Not really.

443
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,415
All right, how many runs you
think they'll win by?

444
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:13,118
Well, they played earlier this
season and they won by four...

445
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,986
but that was without Hosfeld
on the mound.

446
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:17,288
So maybe six or seven.

447
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,960
- Yup. Why?
- All right.

448
00:28:21,294 --> 00:28:23,964
Honey, where are you?

449
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:28,500
Come give Mommy a kiss before
she has to go to her other job.

450
00:28:28,502 --> 00:28:31,002
Why the fuck are you
in my house?

451
00:28:31,004 --> 00:28:33,772
John came to see my game today.
Give me a ride home.

452
00:28:33,774 --> 00:28:37,443
Yeah, okay, fine, I can't deal
with this right now, I'm late.

453
00:28:37,445 --> 00:28:40,182
Go wash up for supper.

454
00:28:45,318 --> 00:28:48,853
What's going on here?

455
00:28:48,855 --> 00:28:50,188
What, it's like the kid said.

456
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,257
Do I have to call the cops?

457
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:54,059
No, why would you call the cops?

458
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:56,795
Because you're an adult alone
with a child...

459
00:28:56,797 --> 00:28:59,865
and somehow there's a new TV
in my house.

460
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:02,502
Well, I had an extra TV, yours
was shit.

461
00:29:02,504 --> 00:29:04,504
Isn't that sweet?

462
00:29:04,506 --> 00:29:07,207
You know, the kid asked
me to come see his game.

463
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:09,208
I gave him a ride home,
what's the big deal?

464
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,877
That's so nice.

465
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,946
Do you give all the kids rides
home or just the cute ones?

466
00:29:12,948 --> 00:29:15,447
Oh, for Fuck's sake, no! I told
him I'd help him pitch.

467
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:18,552
Remember, I was good at baseball
in high school.

468
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:22,823
Look, if this is something else,
I'm gonna find some dude...

469
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:26,893
some big motherfucker to pin you
down and fuck you...

470
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:31,833
right in your ass, some dude
with a giant cock.

471
00:29:31,835 --> 00:29:34,134
- We're clear?
- Yeah, Christ...

472
00:29:34,136 --> 00:29:35,503
we're fucking clear, man.

473
00:29:35,505 --> 00:29:37,304
What are you guys talking about?

474
00:29:37,306 --> 00:29:40,309
Just some grown-up stuff, honey.

475
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:50,318
<i>How did that guy
come up with the light bulb?</i>

476
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,521
<i>I'm not sure, I'll bet
he was walking around...</i>

477
00:29:53,523 --> 00:29:56,525
<i>in the dark looking
for something.</i>

478
00:29:56,527 --> 00:30:01,865
<i>You know, probably came out
of necessity.</i>

479
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:07,401
Hey, you remember Matt Smith.

480
00:30:07,403 --> 00:30:08,970
- You mean Smitty?
- Yeah.

481
00:30:08,972 --> 00:30:11,341
Yeah, he's got his face on those
election posters.

482
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:12,408
He's running for...

483
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,876
- City council.
- Yeah.

484
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:16,112
Yeah, so I see him over
at Dundalk Field, right?

485
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:19,047
And he's got this great job
and this hot-ass wife.

486
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:21,284
I don't know, man, I just
fucking hate him for it.

487
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,618
Yeah, fuck him.

488
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,519
Anyway, I see all these parents
there...

489
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:25,954
and they're really into the
games...

490
00:30:25,956 --> 00:30:27,624
and I noticed a lot of these
parents...

491
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,291
are parents who bet through me
and I'm thinking...

492
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:32,027
why not put some lines out?

493
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:34,999
You're gonna take bets
on little league games.

494
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:37,334
Yeah, people are gonna settle up
with me...

495
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,936
because they're gonna want to
put action on their kids' games.

496
00:30:39,938 --> 00:30:42,038
I don't know.

497
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,674
It's like opening a horse track
in our backyards.

498
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,644
Yeah, but it feels just wrong.

499
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:49,613
Scotty, just think about it
for a second...

500
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:52,449
what's the worst thing
a person can do?

501
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:54,084
Murder someone?

502
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:56,185
Bet with their hearts.

503
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,324
I got a whole stable of betters
who will bet on their kids...

504
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:01,660
regardless of what I set
the lines at.

505
00:31:01,662 --> 00:31:03,962
Plus, the internet can't
touch me.

506
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:06,263
So you really think people are
gonna want to bet...

507
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:08,199
on little league baseball games?

508
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:13,341
I got Boston plus five, $192.
OKC plus three, $186.

509
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,574
Okay.

510
00:31:15,576 --> 00:31:19,978
Hey, uh, you got a kid
at Dundalk right now?

511
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,182
Yeah, I've got that line,
if you want it.

512
00:31:23,184 --> 00:31:26,484
Eagles are minus six.

513
00:31:26,486 --> 00:31:28,386
Yeah, Hosfeld's on the mound.

514
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:30,993
Hey, I know it's high, man,
but the kid can pitch.

515
00:31:32,493 --> 00:31:34,627
You want the Spartans?
All right.

516
00:31:34,629 --> 00:31:37,165
Gotcha, Gordy, duly noted.

517
00:31:50,245 --> 00:31:53,981
<i>Handicapping kids
games ain't hard.</i>

518
00:31:53,983 --> 00:31:57,149
<i>Big kids beat up little kids.</i>

519
00:31:57,151 --> 00:31:59,418
<i>You find the team with the
bigger kid on the mound...</i>

520
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,388
<i>that's typically your favorite.</i>

521
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,657
<i>If his dad is coaching, well...</i>

522
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:07,194
<i>that's a good sign he can play,
as well.</i>

523
00:32:07,196 --> 00:32:09,262
<i>And if his old man is watching
every pitch...</i>

524
00:32:09,264 --> 00:32:12,000
<i>like it's game seven of the
World Series...</i>

525
00:32:12,002 --> 00:32:15,136
Come on, keep your shoulder
in there, over the top!

526
00:32:15,138 --> 00:32:17,605
<i>That's an even
bigger indication...</i>

527
00:32:17,607 --> 00:32:21,208
<i>that the kid is practicing
fundamentals at home.</i>

528
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:26,414
<i>Fundamentals and mechanics,
they're the great equalizers.</i>

529
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:31,252
<i>Balance, rotation, arm angle,
tempo, smooth first step.</i>

530
00:32:31,254 --> 00:32:36,324
<i>That shit can be taught and
they can give you an advantage.</i>

531
00:32:36,326 --> 00:32:39,261
<i>It's usually that simple.</i>

532
00:32:39,263 --> 00:32:42,031
<i>Now some people will try to
complicate things...</i>

533
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:45,767
<i>find some deeper trends that
they think can sway games.</i>

534
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:47,636
You know Richie Porter...

535
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:50,272
now I heard that their family
dog died last week...

536
00:32:50,274 --> 00:32:52,408
and he can't get over it.

537
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,776
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

538
00:32:54,778 --> 00:32:57,045
And their best players,
the Santoro twins?

539
00:32:57,047 --> 00:32:59,448
I heard the parents are getting
a divorce...

540
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,120
and they just told them
about it.

541
00:33:03,454 --> 00:33:06,523
<i>It's usually because they
don't understand the beautiful...</i>

542
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:10,662
<i>simplicity and purity
of baseball.</i>

543
00:33:19,671 --> 00:33:23,340
Whoo-hoo! Christmas came early.

544
00:33:23,342 --> 00:33:26,343
A lot of guys came through this
week to drop off envelopes.

545
00:33:26,345 --> 00:33:28,578
A bunch of them I haven't seen
in months.

546
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,217
Snips, what do you say, buddy?

547
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:49,103
There you go.

548
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,608
It's all there.

549
00:33:57,344 --> 00:33:58,509
Buy you a beer?

550
00:33:58,511 --> 00:34:01,479
No, I got to run.

551
00:34:01,481 --> 00:34:03,216
You got them Dundalk lines yet?

552
00:34:09,388 --> 00:34:10,822
Yeah, I'll take a beer.

553
00:34:10,824 --> 00:34:12,657
We don't tell beer, sir.

554
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,793
Oh, well, uh, give me a Coke.

555
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:18,166
Okay, one Coke coming right up.

556
00:34:37,352 --> 00:34:39,419
- Zibs.
- Smitty.

557
00:34:39,421 --> 00:34:41,821
It's a pretty good turnout,
wouldn't you say?

558
00:34:41,823 --> 00:34:43,624
- Most definitely.
- It's funny...

559
00:34:43,626 --> 00:34:45,424
I don't recognize half the
people here.

560
00:34:45,426 --> 00:34:48,528
I just ran into Adam Kramer. I
didn't know the guy's got kids.

561
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,832
He doesn't.

562
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:08,248
You can look around this
place...

563
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,886
and tell who's got money on the
game.

564
00:35:12,322 --> 00:35:14,288
Strike three!

565
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,456
What the fuck, blue?

566
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:18,728
Get your fucking glasses
checked, you fucking asshole.

567
00:35:21,364 --> 00:35:23,731
How much does he have
on the game?

568
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:27,271
Nothing... just an asshole.

569
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:32,307
Strike!

570
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:36,477
So Andy Fox comes in to Jolyn's
today, pays me, in full.

571
00:35:36,479 --> 00:35:40,883
Wow. I guess your face really
taught his fist a lesson, huh?

572
00:35:40,885 --> 00:35:42,484
Here's the thing, though.

573
00:35:42,486 --> 00:35:44,919
Now he wants action
on today's game.

574
00:35:44,921 --> 00:35:46,790
Sure he does, his boy is
pitching.

575
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:49,728
He didn't want to bet
on his boy.

576
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:54,630
He wants to bet on the other
team.

577
00:35:54,632 --> 00:35:55,898
You told him to go fuck himself,
right?

578
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,902
No. I told him, "Duly noted,
Andy."

579
00:35:58,904 --> 00:36:02,272
You crazy? He's gonna throw
the game.

580
00:36:02,274 --> 00:36:03,409
I know that.

581
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:06,278
Hey, yo, time.

582
00:36:08,379 --> 00:36:10,914
Come here, give me the ball,
give me the ball.

583
00:36:10,916 --> 00:36:13,416
You're not listening. Give me
the ball.

584
00:36:19,392 --> 00:36:22,329
Come on, little man,
we all play on this team.

585
00:36:24,396 --> 00:36:27,398
You throw it like you're in
control, you know, you got it?

586
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,899
My biggest worry was parents
throwing games.

587
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:32,836
I gave Andy the rope, let him
hang himself.

588
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:34,942
Make an example out of him.

589
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:54,592
<i>In any new business venture...</i>

590
00:36:54,594 --> 00:36:59,564
<i>there's gonna be a couple bumps
in the road...</i>

591
00:36:59,566 --> 00:37:03,938
<i>but in the end, the market has
a way of correcting itself.</i>

592
00:37:06,574 --> 00:37:12,644
<i>Business was good, better than
a few of my football seasons.</i>

593
00:37:12,646 --> 00:37:16,048
Hello? Hey...

594
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:19,017
<i>I had to bring Stevie on,
help me answer the phones.</i>

595
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:21,421
- Hey, Grundy, what's happening?
- Of course, I got a line on it.

596
00:37:21,423 --> 00:37:24,625
No, I'm lousy, my fucking ear
is like a piece of shit.

597
00:37:24,627 --> 00:37:26,794
Yeah, I got the lines.

598
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:29,499
I'm looking at the Eagles
minus three.

599
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:34,468
- The over-under's 11.
- Yeah, 11.

600
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:38,906
You want the money line,
it's minus $150?

601
00:37:38,908 --> 00:37:42,776
So the Eagles, for a nickel,
right?

602
00:37:42,778 --> 00:37:44,745
Don't fucking take it then,
I don't give a shit.

603
00:37:44,747 --> 00:37:46,481
Hey Grundy, don't be such
a prick.

604
00:37:46,483 --> 00:37:49,016
<i>Even had to buy
an extra shoe box...</i>

605
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:51,421
<i>to store all the money
I was making.</i>

606
00:37:55,492 --> 00:37:57,495
Strike three!

607
00:37:58,661 --> 00:38:01,429
What was that, man? Hey, relax!

608
00:38:01,431 --> 00:38:03,365
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

609
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:06,501
Hey, Mike, Gordy, Gordy, Mike!
Sit down, Gordy.

610
00:38:06,503 --> 00:38:09,875
There are children present,
for Christ's sake.

611
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:14,810
<i>I had the whole
town on board.</i>

612
00:38:14,812 --> 00:38:20,085
<i>Well, the whole town except
for this fucking guy.</i>

613
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,660
That's it, great game today,
okay, guys? Great dedication.

614
00:38:32,662 --> 00:38:34,764
Maybe we can all do a little
base running.

615
00:38:34,766 --> 00:38:36,933
You're moving the hands in,
Knights on three.

616
00:38:36,935 --> 00:38:39,402
- One, two, three.
- Knights!

617
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:43,038
Practice Tuesday, I want nobody
sleeping in, that's you, 25.

618
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,875
Russ, can I talk to you
for a minute?

619
00:38:44,877 --> 00:38:46,041
What's up?

620
00:38:46,043 --> 00:38:47,610
I wanna talk to you about Brian.

621
00:38:47,612 --> 00:38:49,079
Yeah, good kid.

622
00:38:49,081 --> 00:38:50,947
Kind of hoping you'd let him
take the bump again.

623
00:38:50,949 --> 00:38:54,117
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

624
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,751
Look, I've been working
with him, okay?

625
00:38:55,753 --> 00:38:58,189
Look, as a coach, I feel a
certain responsibility...

626
00:38:58,191 --> 00:39:00,758
to protect these kids against
embarrassing themselves.

627
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,026
Yeah, but the kid wants
to pitch.

628
00:39:02,028 --> 00:39:03,894
Yeah, and I want to bang
Pat Creadon's mom...

629
00:39:03,896 --> 00:39:06,196
okay, it's just not realistic.

630
00:39:06,198 --> 00:39:07,964
How much?

631
00:39:07,966 --> 00:39:09,700
How much would I pay?

632
00:39:09,702 --> 00:39:11,202
Dude, how much to let him pitch?

633
00:39:11,204 --> 00:39:12,970
Look, I know you're taking money
on the games...

634
00:39:12,972 --> 00:39:15,606
and I don't want any part
of nothing you're throwing.

635
00:39:15,608 --> 00:39:18,443
Hey, I heard what those people
did to Andy Fox's truck, okay?

636
00:39:18,445 --> 00:39:21,211
It's on the level, I promise.

637
00:39:21,213 --> 00:39:23,748
Come on, just give me a number.

638
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,516
- $500.
- Fuck you.

639
00:39:25,518 --> 00:39:26,552
$450.

640
00:39:26,554 --> 00:39:27,587
- $150.
- $400.

641
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:30,822
$150 plus $15 for every inning
the kid pitches.

642
00:39:30,824 --> 00:39:32,757
$20.

643
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:34,460
All right.

644
00:39:34,462 --> 00:39:38,197
All right, we got the bears next
week. He's got the bump.

645
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,868
Thanks.

646
00:39:54,582 --> 00:39:56,619
See what you got.

647
00:40:03,525 --> 00:40:05,124
That was terrible.

648
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:08,898
Your mechanics are shit. Who
taught you how to throw a ball?

649
00:40:10,632 --> 00:40:13,567
All right, here's what
I want you to do.

650
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:16,871
I want you to take your lead
elbow, you aim it at the plate.

651
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:19,739
- Like this?
- No, like that.

652
00:40:19,741 --> 00:40:21,708
There you go, all right?

653
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,176
That's your pointer, you do
everything else right...

654
00:40:23,178 --> 00:40:26,045
the ball is gonna go where
that aims. Okay?

655
00:40:26,047 --> 00:40:27,781
Now this is important,
look at me.

656
00:40:27,783 --> 00:40:30,750
First batter you face, I want
you to throw it at him.

657
00:40:30,752 --> 00:40:32,252
You want me to hit a kid.

658
00:40:32,254 --> 00:40:35,523
- Naw, he'll get out of the way.
- What if he doesn't?

659
00:40:35,525 --> 00:40:37,157
That's why you wear helmets.

660
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:41,061
Look, this is your plate, okay?
You own it.

661
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,796
You brush that first
kid back a little.

662
00:40:42,798 --> 00:40:44,798
You're gonna send a message
to the rest of the team...

663
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,267
not to get too close.

664
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:48,702
Then you're gonna be inside
their heads...

665
00:40:48,704 --> 00:40:50,005
and that's the most
important part of pitching.

666
00:40:50,007 --> 00:40:51,539
More important than
throwing?

667
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:55,543
Let's just say "yes".
Give me the ball.

668
00:40:55,545 --> 00:40:58,013
All right?

669
00:40:58,015 --> 00:41:00,815
Right there. That's how
I want you to hold it, okay?

670
00:41:00,817 --> 00:41:02,685
That's your grip, all right?

671
00:41:02,687 --> 00:41:05,754
Your arm angle, it's kind of
like you're throwing a football.

672
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:07,790
- Like this?
- There you go, that's right.

673
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:10,292
When you follow through,
flick it with your wrist.

674
00:41:10,294 --> 00:41:11,826
Isn't that a curveball?

675
00:41:11,828 --> 00:41:13,828
Yeah, man, it's your bread
and butter.

676
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,665
But I'm 12, I'm not supposed
to throw curve balls.

677
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:18,000
Who told you that?

678
00:41:18,002 --> 00:41:20,136
Everyone tells kids that,
it'll mess up your arm.

679
00:41:20,138 --> 00:41:21,938
Oh, my god, all right,
here's the harsh truth.

680
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:25,074
You're never going to
play professional baseball.

681
00:41:25,076 --> 00:41:26,577
Wait, look, here's the good
news...

682
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:28,177
neither is anyone else
in this league.

683
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:31,213
- Not even Ryan Hosfeld?
- No, not even Ryan Hosfeld.

684
00:41:31,215 --> 00:41:34,117
You know, and another hard
truth, next year you turn 13...

685
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,619
they're gonna move you
to the big field.

686
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:37,688
Now you can barely
get that ball over now.

687
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,690
What do you think the odds are
you get it over next year?

688
00:41:39,692 --> 00:41:42,124
- Not good?
- That's right, not good.

689
00:41:42,126 --> 00:41:44,998
If you want to pitch,
you gotta throw the curve, kid.

690
00:41:46,865 --> 00:41:49,569
I hold it like this?

691
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:59,145
What are you doing, practicing
sitting on the bench?

692
00:42:04,283 --> 00:42:06,283
- What was that about?
- Nothing.

693
00:42:06,285 --> 00:42:08,752
Didn't look like nothing to me.

694
00:42:08,754 --> 00:42:12,023
That's Brett and Abe, they're
on my team, they're dicks.

695
00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:15,393
You know what you gotta do,
you gotta shut them up.

696
00:42:15,395 --> 00:42:17,029
No, I'm not worried about it.

697
00:42:17,031 --> 00:42:19,697
- What are you afraid of?
- Getting my teeth kicked in?

698
00:42:19,699 --> 00:42:21,065
All right, first of all,
they're your baby teeth.

699
00:42:21,067 --> 00:42:22,668
- But...
- Okay? You're gonna get...

700
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,168
a whole, new set of teeth,
you're playing with house money.

701
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:25,804
But these are my adult teeth.

702
00:42:25,806 --> 00:42:27,405
- Really?
- Yeah.

703
00:42:27,407 --> 00:42:29,375
And I don't want to get punched
in the face.

704
00:42:29,377 --> 00:42:34,647
Look at me, I got punched
in the face, I'm fine.

705
00:42:34,649 --> 00:42:36,649
He's 12 years old, how hard
can he hit?

706
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:39,051
I don't want to find out and
I don't want to get in trouble.

707
00:42:39,053 --> 00:42:40,854
You're not gonna get in trouble.

708
00:42:40,856 --> 00:42:43,256
Look, here's the things that
grownups never tell you, okay?

709
00:42:43,258 --> 00:42:44,658
Right now, you're a minor.

710
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,292
You can get into as much trouble
as you want.

711
00:42:46,294 --> 00:42:48,861
When you turn 18, it all
goes away.

712
00:42:48,863 --> 00:42:50,330
- Really?
- Yeah, man.

713
00:42:50,332 --> 00:42:52,298
I mean, don't go burning
houses down and shit...

714
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,901
but fighting and stuff,
it's forgivable.

715
00:42:55,903 --> 00:42:57,136
I don't know.

716
00:42:57,138 --> 00:43:00,206
Look at me. Punch his mouth
open.

717
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:02,842
- What?
- Just hit him, man, lock him up.

718
00:43:02,844 --> 00:43:06,012
I'll break it up before he gets
a shot in on you, okay?

719
00:43:06,014 --> 00:43:08,315
I don't know.

720
00:43:08,317 --> 00:43:10,684
Trust me, all right.

721
00:43:10,686 --> 00:43:12,786
They will know that messing
with Brian Houston...

722
00:43:12,788 --> 00:43:15,723
comes with consequences.

723
00:43:15,725 --> 00:43:17,123
Go get 'em, man.

724
00:43:17,125 --> 00:43:18,692
You're not coming with me?

725
00:43:18,694 --> 00:43:20,161
What's it gonna look like
if I walk over there...

726
00:43:20,163 --> 00:43:21,997
and watch you punch a 12 year
old in the face?

727
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,131
Oh.

728
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:26,734
Now go, come on.

729
00:43:26,736 --> 00:43:29,037
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait,
come here.

730
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,872
- What?
- How are you going to punch him?

731
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:32,106
I don't know.

732
00:43:32,108 --> 00:43:34,876
Let me see you throw a punch.

733
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:37,412
That's not gonna work.
Come on, get it, give it to me.

734
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,414
Gotta use your waist,
your hips...

735
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:42,283
- My hips?
- Legs, wham, like that.

736
00:43:42,285 --> 00:43:44,785
- Like...
- Put your body into it.

737
00:43:44,787 --> 00:43:48,424
There you go, killer, come on.
Come on!

738
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:50,862
Knock him on his ass, buddy,
go get him.

739
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,105
Oh, shit!

740
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:12,749
Ay-yo!

741
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:14,251
Beaches, how you doing today?

742
00:44:14,253 --> 00:44:15,986
Just peachy.

743
00:44:15,988 --> 00:44:19,459
Give us a couple cold ones,
fancy stuff, please.

744
00:44:26,298 --> 00:44:27,331
I'm pitching today.

745
00:44:27,333 --> 00:44:28,865
That's cool.

746
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:30,099
Back the rest of these fine
gentlemen up...

747
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:31,434
for me as well, would ya?

748
00:44:31,436 --> 00:44:33,804
What, everybody's pitching
today?

749
00:44:33,806 --> 00:44:36,975
Hey, hey, hey!
Get your cold beer here!

750
00:44:36,977 --> 00:44:43,313
Hey, guys, this is Brian,
kid's taking the bump today.

751
00:44:43,315 --> 00:44:44,415
- Ah...
- How are ya', kid?

752
00:44:44,417 --> 00:44:46,183
That's Steve and Larry.

753
00:44:46,185 --> 00:44:49,187
- That's Snips.
- Hi, Snips.

754
00:44:49,189 --> 00:44:52,056
Hey.

755
00:44:52,058 --> 00:44:53,558
He talks funny.

756
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,960
Snips had a stroke a few years
back.

757
00:44:55,962 --> 00:44:57,463
He's all there, he just can't
communicate.

758
00:44:57,465 --> 00:44:59,197
What's a stroke?

759
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:01,333
It's a brain thing, one day
you're fine...

760
00:45:01,335 --> 00:45:03,369
the next, you're speaking
with your hands.

761
00:45:03,371 --> 00:45:04,869
<i>Can I have a stroke?</i>

762
00:45:04,871 --> 00:45:06,007
Sure, you can.

763
00:45:08,208 --> 00:45:10,441
What's he doing?

764
00:45:10,443 --> 00:45:14,313
That's Alphons, he's taking bets
on horses.

765
00:45:14,315 --> 00:45:15,947
You want to bet on a race?

766
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:19,987
- Sure.
- Alphons, throw me a book.

767
00:45:24,325 --> 00:45:27,028
All right, pick a horse.

768
00:45:28,196 --> 00:45:29,895
How do I do that?

769
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:33,332
It's complicated, so just go
with your favorite name for now.

770
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:35,535
This one... Paid in Full.

771
00:45:35,537 --> 00:45:38,571
My kind of horse. Go ahead and
tell Alphons, say...

772
00:45:38,573 --> 00:45:41,241
"I want 10 bucks on
Paid in Full."

773
00:45:41,243 --> 00:45:42,845
- Cool?
- Mm-hm.

774
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:46,914
Ten bucks on Paid in Full,
please.

775
00:45:46,916 --> 00:45:49,887
Alphons, kid's with me,
he's good for it.

776
00:45:51,621 --> 00:45:53,253
<i>Yo, man, I'm at the site.</i>

777
00:45:53,255 --> 00:45:55,291
<i>Where you at?</i>

778
00:45:58,862 --> 00:46:00,561
<i>Just Kidding, Paid in Full...</i>

779
00:46:00,563 --> 00:46:05,132
<i>Paid in Full, Just Kidding,
nose and nose, 100 yards to go.</i>

780
00:46:05,134 --> 00:46:07,367
<i>And Just Kidding wins it...</i>

781
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:09,470
- Oh, that was close.
- We almost won.

782
00:46:09,472 --> 00:46:13,174
Yup... now you gotta pay
Alphons, though.

783
00:46:13,176 --> 00:46:15,243
I don't have any money.

784
00:46:15,245 --> 00:46:18,113
You made a bet without any
money.

785
00:46:18,115 --> 00:46:19,982
Now Alphons is gonna have
to take you out back...

786
00:46:19,984 --> 00:46:21,286
and break your legs.

787
00:46:23,019 --> 00:46:24,419
I'll spot you the $10.

788
00:46:24,421 --> 00:46:27,356
Be tough for you to pitch
with broken legs.

789
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:29,557
Now you owe me 10 bucks.

790
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:32,361
How you gonna pay me back,
you got a job or something?

791
00:46:32,363 --> 00:46:35,097
No.

792
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:37,599
You can owe me.

793
00:46:37,601 --> 00:46:39,902
Don't let me see you around town
spending money, you got it?

794
00:46:39,904 --> 00:46:42,170
- You won't.
- All right.

795
00:46:42,172 --> 00:46:43,875
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

796
00:46:46,978 --> 00:46:50,012
One, two, three, break!
Get out there, let's go!

797
00:47:02,628 --> 00:47:07,330
<i>You know what?
Kid wasn't half bad.</i>

798
00:47:07,332 --> 00:47:09,566
<i>I'm not saying he's the second
coming of Greg Maddux...</i>

799
00:47:09,568 --> 00:47:13,403
<i>or nothing, but he found
his aim.</i>

800
00:47:13,405 --> 00:47:15,474
<i>Brushed some kids off the
plate.</i>

801
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:27,485
<i>His mechanics... they weren't
shit.</i>

802
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:31,221
<i>He even used that curve ball
we worked on.</i>

803
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:34,025
<i>He went the full six innings,
only gave up a handful of runs.</i>

804
00:47:34,027 --> 00:47:38,362
<i>Which is pretty damn good for a
kid on the smaller side of 12.</i>

805
00:47:38,364 --> 00:47:40,699
<i>Would he have finished the game
if his coach didn't have...</i>

806
00:47:40,701 --> 00:47:45,271
<i>a vested interest in leaving
him in, who the hell knows.</i>

807
00:47:45,273 --> 00:47:47,740
<i>But he got the W...</i>

808
00:47:47,742 --> 00:47:52,381
<i>and maybe earned a little
respect in the process.</i>

809
00:48:04,492 --> 00:48:06,528
- Great game.
- Yup.

810
00:48:10,498 --> 00:48:13,132
Kid pitched well, you were
right.

811
00:48:13,134 --> 00:48:14,603
- Sure did.
- Yup.

812
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,712
So...

813
00:48:29,618 --> 00:48:33,724
It's, uh... good doing
business with you.

814
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:47,601
- Good stuff, buddy.
- Yeah.

815
00:48:47,603 --> 00:48:50,238
- See you later.
- See ya'.

816
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,305
Good job, buddy.

817
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:54,709
Mom, you should have seen
me pitch! I did great.

818
00:48:54,711 --> 00:48:58,450
- We won!
- That's so good, honey.

819
00:48:59,716 --> 00:49:02,484
Hey, hold on a second.

820
00:49:02,486 --> 00:49:04,218
What's up?

821
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,455
You're a fucking asshole,
that's what's up.

822
00:49:06,457 --> 00:49:08,290
What I do now.

823
00:49:08,292 --> 00:49:10,725
I don't want you hanging out
with him. He's not your kid.

824
00:49:10,727 --> 00:49:12,593
Okay? He's my kid!

825
00:49:12,595 --> 00:49:14,430
Whoa, slow down, all right?
I know that.

826
00:49:14,432 --> 00:49:16,064
- Do you?
- Yeah.

827
00:49:16,066 --> 00:49:19,634
I hear you're taking
bets on kids' games.

828
00:49:19,636 --> 00:49:21,204
Who told you that, man?

829
00:49:21,206 --> 00:49:22,472
A little birdie.

830
00:49:22,474 --> 00:49:24,807
Yeah, well, that little birdie's
making shit up.

831
00:49:24,809 --> 00:49:29,612
You fucking lie to me
and I will call the cops.

832
00:49:29,614 --> 00:49:32,682
All right, fine, I'm taking bets
on games...

833
00:49:32,684 --> 00:49:34,617
but it's got nothing to do
with your son.

834
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:36,219
You expect me to believe that.

835
00:49:36,221 --> 00:49:37,619
Hey look, I got a lot
of money out.

836
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:39,521
I got a dad I gotta take
care of, okay.

837
00:49:39,523 --> 00:49:42,092
But none of that shit's got
anything to do with me and him.

838
00:49:42,094 --> 00:49:45,328
The last thing this boy
needs is someone using him.

839
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:47,698
I'm not using him. I know all
the players by now.

840
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:50,100
If I were using him, I wouldn't
still be hanging around.

841
00:49:50,102 --> 00:49:55,138
Leave him alone, Mom!
He's my friend.

842
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,241
He's not your friend. I don't
want you hanging around him.

843
00:49:58,243 --> 00:50:00,113
He is, too!

844
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:14,559
So she says she don't want me to
hang out with the kid no more...

845
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:16,661
after he pitched a great game.

846
00:50:16,663 --> 00:50:19,666
I thought I was at least in line
for a thank you.

847
00:50:31,811 --> 00:50:34,312
What's wrong with you?

848
00:50:34,314 --> 00:50:36,883
You "no-showed" at work.

849
00:50:36,885 --> 00:50:40,720
I couldn't make it, you know,
kid had a game.

850
00:50:40,722 --> 00:50:43,388
What are you gonna do,
I was busy.

851
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:45,725
You don't just "no-show".

852
00:50:45,727 --> 00:50:48,361
I went out of my way to get
you that job.

853
00:50:48,363 --> 00:50:50,328
And I appreciate the heck
out of it, pal...

854
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,497
but my phone's been
ringing off the hook, man.

855
00:50:52,499 --> 00:50:55,269
I had to bring on Stevie
just to help answer calls.

856
00:50:56,838 --> 00:51:00,375
I'm sorry, dude. Come on,
man, I'm sorry.

857
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:03,379
Want a whiskey?

858
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:07,183
Petey, line us up, buddy.

859
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:11,918
- So'd you call her?
- Who?

860
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,255
After you slept with her,
did you call her?

861
00:51:15,257 --> 00:51:16,590
No.

862
00:51:16,592 --> 00:51:18,357
So you never called her and
you're hanging out...

863
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:20,961
with her son and you have no
idea why she's upset.

864
00:51:20,963 --> 00:51:22,863
You think it's about her?

865
00:51:22,865 --> 00:51:25,566
Man, you ain't never dated
a woman with kids?

866
00:51:25,568 --> 00:51:27,334
No.

867
00:51:27,336 --> 00:51:29,204
You can't break up with the
woman and still hang out...

868
00:51:29,206 --> 00:51:31,506
with the kid, it don't work
that way.

869
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:34,374
You've gotta break up with both.

870
00:51:34,376 --> 00:51:35,709
Come on, man.

871
00:51:35,711 --> 00:51:39,414
Remember Nicole Nvargia?

872
00:51:39,416 --> 00:51:40,914
Yeah.

873
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:42,483
I stayed with her
for two years...

874
00:51:42,485 --> 00:51:45,920
because I couldn't say goodbye
to her kids.

875
00:51:45,922 --> 00:51:49,424
Those were good kids, though.

876
00:51:49,426 --> 00:51:52,860
So you're saying, if I want to
hang out with a kid...

877
00:51:52,862 --> 00:51:54,899
Then you gotta hang out
with the mom.

878
00:52:13,517 --> 00:52:14,985
Why don't you go sit at the bar?

879
00:52:14,987 --> 00:52:17,856
Because I want to sit
at this table.

880
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:21,758
Yeah, well, what are you
drinking?

881
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:27,796
A Bud, and look... I'm sorry.

882
00:52:27,798 --> 00:52:29,965
For what?

883
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:32,735
Because I never called you...

884
00:52:32,737 --> 00:52:35,839
and I've been hanging out with
your kid and you know...

885
00:52:35,841 --> 00:52:38,542
I know that maybe that's not
acceptable.

886
00:52:38,544 --> 00:52:41,279
What are you talking about?

887
00:52:41,281 --> 00:52:43,681
I know you're pissed,
because I never called you.

888
00:52:43,683 --> 00:52:46,420
Who told you that bullshit.

889
00:52:48,053 --> 00:52:50,288
That's not what's going on?

890
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:55,329
Look, you're nice, but
you're depressing as fuck.

891
00:52:59,565 --> 00:53:00,699
Then why'd you yell at me?

892
00:53:00,701 --> 00:53:02,333
'Cause you're awful around kids.

893
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,068
You told him he was
going to have a stroke?

894
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:06,505
No, I told him he
could have a stroke.

895
00:53:06,507 --> 00:53:07,838
He got punched in the face.

896
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,374
Well, kids get into fights, man.

897
00:53:09,376 --> 00:53:11,443
Not when they're with adults.

898
00:53:11,445 --> 00:53:13,679
You told him he could get into
as much trouble...

899
00:53:13,681 --> 00:53:15,713
as he wants until he's 18.

900
00:53:15,715 --> 00:53:17,581
He told you that?

901
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:20,652
I'm his mother. He tells me
everything.

902
00:53:20,654 --> 00:53:22,555
I told him within reason.

903
00:53:22,557 --> 00:53:25,091
Was that before or after you
told him...

904
00:53:25,093 --> 00:53:26,725
that he would never play
pro baseball?

905
00:53:26,727 --> 00:53:29,796
That I was just being on the
level with him, I mean...

906
00:53:29,798 --> 00:53:32,999
He's 12, he doesn't need you
to be on the level with him.

907
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,767
He's got his whole
life to be disappointed.

908
00:53:34,769 --> 00:53:36,002
Let him have this.

909
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,803
All right, look, I'm sorry.

910
00:53:37,805 --> 00:53:39,839
He said he wanted to get his
name on the Wall of Fame...

911
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,011
and... and I want to help him
do that.

912
00:53:44,479 --> 00:53:47,483
You really think he could
get his name on the wall?

913
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:50,818
Maybe if he, if he pitches
well...

914
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,985
for the rest of the season
then... maybe.

915
00:53:52,987 --> 00:53:56,356
He really pitched well?

916
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,425
He did.

917
00:53:58,427 --> 00:54:02,362
Okay, fine, but none of this
depressing shit.

918
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:03,797
No problem.

919
00:54:03,799 --> 00:54:06,400
As long as you guys ain't
robbin' houses or nothing.

920
00:54:06,402 --> 00:54:08,068
Of course.

921
00:54:08,070 --> 00:54:10,007
I'll get you your beer.

922
00:54:15,445 --> 00:54:18,912
<i>Remember when
I told you that everything...</i>

923
00:54:18,914 --> 00:54:21,017
<i>in my life eventually went
to shit?</i>

924
00:54:27,124 --> 00:54:30,024
Back him up, and give me
a bottle of your finest.

925
00:54:30,026 --> 00:54:32,831
- Keep the change.
- All right, sure.

926
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,831
John.

927
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:39,567
Never seen you in here before.

928
00:54:39,569 --> 00:54:41,936
You trying to drum up
some votes?

929
00:54:41,938 --> 00:54:45,543
No, I came to see you.

930
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:53,416
I want you to stop gambling
on the boys baseball games.

931
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:56,085
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

932
00:54:56,087 --> 00:55:00,524
The other day, a man threw a
beer bottle...

933
00:55:00,526 --> 00:55:02,492
through one of our umpires'
windshields.

934
00:55:02,494 --> 00:55:03,926
Shouldn't have blown the call.

935
00:55:03,928 --> 00:55:05,365
John.

936
00:55:07,032 --> 00:55:09,865
Okay, look, things are a little
out of control...

937
00:55:09,867 --> 00:55:12,568
but it sure as shit
ain't my fault.

938
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:15,638
Your problem is with these
animals here in town, not me.

939
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,675
Don't make me out to be
the bad guy here.

940
00:55:18,677 --> 00:55:21,645
What are you going to do?
Call the cops.

941
00:55:21,647 --> 00:55:23,580
They don't give a shit
about gambling.

942
00:55:23,582 --> 00:55:26,984
Even if they did, half the
Dundalk PD bets through me, so...

943
00:55:26,986 --> 00:55:29,719
I'll cancel the season.

944
00:55:29,721 --> 00:55:33,526
Can't imagine that's gonna
help you get many votes.

945
00:55:40,466 --> 00:55:42,869
I know you're robbing houses.

946
00:55:46,507 --> 00:55:48,539
I have no idea what you're...

947
00:55:48,541 --> 00:55:50,742
I'm running for city office?
I talk to people.

948
00:55:50,744 --> 00:55:52,644
They voice their concerns.

949
00:55:52,646 --> 00:55:56,747
The other day, I'm going door to
door and somehow I ended...

950
00:55:56,749 --> 00:56:01,619
at Adam Kramer's, he tells me
that his TV got stolen...

951
00:56:01,621 --> 00:56:03,120
and it's the only thing
that they took.

952
00:56:03,122 --> 00:56:05,624
He thinks it's some kids
from the area...

953
00:56:05,626 --> 00:56:09,161
and I think that's a plausible
theory. Cops agree with it.

954
00:56:09,163 --> 00:56:12,632
Then I find out that the same
model TV taken...

955
00:56:12,634 --> 00:56:15,801
from Adam Kramer's
is at Debbie Houston's.

956
00:56:15,803 --> 00:56:19,571
And I know that she's working
two jobs just to pay the bills.

957
00:56:19,573 --> 00:56:22,912
So there's no way she's buying
a brand-new flat-screen TV.

958
00:56:24,245 --> 00:56:29,214
Everybody knows that Adam Kramer
is a degenerate gambler...

959
00:56:29,216 --> 00:56:33,854
and then I hear from some people
that he owed you a lot of money.

960
00:56:33,856 --> 00:56:37,090
I'm thinking that's a
heck of a coincidence.

961
00:56:37,092 --> 00:56:44,264
One TV, two links to you.
What do you think?

962
00:56:44,266 --> 00:56:45,668
I think you're thinking
too much.

963
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:51,804
Am I? Maybe I'll run it
by Adam Kramer.

964
00:56:51,806 --> 00:56:54,708
Good luck running anything
by Adam Kramer.

965
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:58,747
But then I'll try Chief Taggart
when I meet with him next week.

966
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:02,252
See how many recent robbery
victims bet through you.

967
00:57:10,193 --> 00:57:12,162
Thank you much.

968
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:23,873
Hey, what's it going to take?

969
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:26,342
- What?
- What do you want?

970
00:57:26,344 --> 00:57:32,083
Campaign contribution. You want
a cut, cash, what do you want?

971
00:57:34,085 --> 00:57:36,121
I want you to do
the right thing.

972
00:58:01,146 --> 00:58:02,879
What are you doing?

973
00:58:02,881 --> 00:58:05,649
Taking the TV, because you can't
keep your mouth shut.

974
00:58:05,651 --> 00:58:07,283
What do you mean? I didn't
tell anyone.

975
00:58:07,285 --> 00:58:08,886
Sure, you didn't.

976
00:58:08,888 --> 00:58:10,654
Just like you didn't tell
your mommy everything.

977
00:58:10,656 --> 00:58:13,157
I didn't tell her about
the TV or anyone else.

978
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:14,891
- Oh, then how does everyone know?
- I don't know.

979
00:58:14,893 --> 00:58:16,927
- Well, I didn't tell anyone.
- Well, neither did I!

980
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:18,630
Well then, how does your league
commissioner know...

981
00:58:18,632 --> 00:58:20,797
that the TV we stole was
in your house?

982
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,135
I don't know.

983
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:28,139
What are you gonna do with it?

984
00:58:28,141 --> 00:58:29,706
It doesn't matter.

985
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:31,275
You need to learn that actions
have consequences.

986
00:58:31,277 --> 00:58:32,810
What the hell is that?

987
00:58:32,812 --> 00:58:34,847
It's a TV, Dad, what does
it look like?

988
00:58:34,849 --> 00:58:38,182
Well, is it hot? I can't
have a hot TV in here.

989
00:58:38,184 --> 00:58:40,251
You want the TV or not?

990
00:58:40,253 --> 00:58:42,687
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch.

991
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:46,158
I got a guy after me,
had to watch my back.

992
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,825
You got anything on him?

993
00:58:47,827 --> 00:58:50,428
No, there's not a damn thing
on him, he's clean.

994
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:53,698
Every man's got something.

995
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,867
Some guys, you just gotta
look harder.

996
00:58:55,869 --> 00:58:57,837
Okay. You got any cables?

997
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,706
Yeah, I don't know,
try the back room.

998
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:01,674
What the fuck do I know
about cables?

999
00:59:01,676 --> 00:59:05,712
Jesus, this is a big
son-of-a-bitch, look at that.

1000
00:59:05,714 --> 00:59:08,083
And way thin.

1001
00:59:11,886 --> 00:59:13,286
You kept all this shit?

1002
00:59:13,288 --> 00:59:16,822
Yeah, what do you mean?
Of course I kept it.

1003
00:59:16,824 --> 00:59:19,692
- Why?
- Why?

1004
00:59:19,694 --> 00:59:22,863
Well, I don't know, I thought
maybe someday...

1005
00:59:22,865 --> 00:59:26,966
you'd like to have it, you know,
give it to your kids.

1006
00:59:26,968 --> 00:59:29,736
Yeah, well it doesn't exactly
bring up happy memories, Dad.

1007
00:59:29,738 --> 00:59:32,642
- Hey, I did my best.
- Yeah, well...

1008
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:41,247
Hey! You okay? Come on,
sit down, whoa, whoa.

1009
00:59:41,249 --> 00:59:43,283
And how long have you
been smoking?

1010
00:59:43,285 --> 00:59:45,786
I don't know, forever.

1011
00:59:45,788 --> 00:59:47,922
Yup, well, this is how
it happens.

1012
00:59:47,924 --> 00:59:49,391
I know, I know.

1013
00:59:49,393 --> 00:59:52,393
I would advise you to stop,
but you already know that.

1014
00:59:52,395 --> 00:59:54,830
How many times you want me
to say, I know.

1015
00:59:54,832 --> 00:59:57,332
I was looking at your previous
doctor.

1016
00:59:57,334 --> 01:00:00,268
I don't recognize a Dr. Mancini,
he work in the area?

1017
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:04,004
- Souza County.
- Souza County... hospital?

1018
01:00:04,006 --> 01:00:06,143
Prison.

1019
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,847
This should help with the
breathing.

1020
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:14,751
You're not far away from an
oxygen tank if you're wondering.

1021
01:00:14,753 --> 01:00:16,888
Thank you.

1022
01:00:20,758 --> 01:00:22,758
Doc?

1023
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,862
What's this gonna cost me
ballpark.

1024
01:00:25,864 --> 01:00:29,097
I doubt Medicare covers this,
so probably 200 bucks.

1025
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:31,467
- What, a month?
- Three weeks or so.

1026
01:00:31,469 --> 01:00:33,437
Jesus Christ, what's the point
of having Medicare...

1027
01:00:33,439 --> 01:00:34,904
if it doesn't cover this shit.

1028
01:00:34,906 --> 01:00:38,841
How long I gotta keep refilling
it for?

1029
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:42,145
On this medicine, I give him
five years, if he's lucky.

1030
01:00:42,147 --> 01:00:44,450
Thanks.

1031
01:00:49,321 --> 01:00:50,824
Thank you.

1032
01:00:52,223 --> 01:00:56,160
I mean, I thought he was dead.

1033
01:00:56,162 --> 01:00:58,199
Oh, man.

1034
01:01:00,934 --> 01:01:02,833
I'm a mess, man.

1035
01:01:02,835 --> 01:01:05,235
It's like, just when I was
getting even, this happens.

1036
01:01:05,237 --> 01:01:08,338
And I got Smitty breathing
down my neck.

1037
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:11,074
Maybe you should stop.

1038
01:01:11,076 --> 01:01:12,811
Stop? Why?

1039
01:01:12,813 --> 01:01:17,215
'Cause... it's kind of shitty
anyway.

1040
01:01:17,217 --> 01:01:20,519
It's not my fault that people
in his town act like savages.

1041
01:01:20,521 --> 01:01:22,087
Okay? I'm not the one out there
telling them...

1042
01:01:22,089 --> 01:01:23,221
to set the place on fire.

1043
01:01:23,223 --> 01:01:25,057
But you're handing them
the matches.

1044
01:01:25,059 --> 01:01:28,227
Oh, bullshit, somebody just
fucking hates me.

1045
01:01:28,229 --> 01:01:29,828
Nobody hates you.

1046
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:31,497
Circumstances have proven
otherwise.

1047
01:01:31,499 --> 01:01:33,933
You both had it coming.

1048
01:01:33,935 --> 01:01:36,202
Your dad has been smoking as far
back as I have memories...

1049
01:01:36,204 --> 01:01:41,372
and I've got to say you haven't
exactly been on the level.

1050
01:01:41,374 --> 01:01:42,473
I get no support from you?

1051
01:01:42,475 --> 01:01:44,411
Well, this is your support.

1052
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:47,313
You live life like everyone's
in your way.

1053
01:01:47,315 --> 01:01:50,217
Preventing you from getting to
some level of happiness...

1054
01:01:50,219 --> 01:01:52,284
that I ain't even quite sure
is out there.

1055
01:01:52,286 --> 01:01:55,521
No, people owe me money, okay?
I gotta take care of my dad.

1056
01:01:55,523 --> 01:01:58,090
That money solves real problems
for me.

1057
01:01:58,092 --> 01:02:01,862
You'll but you ticket in beds from guys who don't
have lots of money, then they shouldn't bet.

1058
01:02:01,864 --> 01:02:04,163
Well maybe you shouldn't
be taken advantage of them.

1059
01:02:04,165 --> 01:02:06,032
I just want people to show me
the same respect...

1060
01:02:06,034 --> 01:02:07,500
that I show them.

1061
01:02:07,502 --> 01:02:12,339
Oh, like the respect you showed
me by not showing up for work?

1062
01:02:12,341 --> 01:02:14,274
You want me to keep going?

1063
01:02:14,276 --> 01:02:17,044
You have more to say?

1064
01:02:17,046 --> 01:02:21,015
Things are only unfair when they
don't go your way.

1065
01:02:21,017 --> 01:02:22,617
Aw, fuck you, Scotty.

1066
01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:24,285
I'm just trying to help, man.

1067
01:02:24,287 --> 01:02:26,557
Well, I don't want your
fucking help.

1068
01:02:39,002 --> 01:02:42,103
<i>As much
as I hate to admit it...</i>

1069
01:02:42,105 --> 01:02:43,272
<i>maybe Scotty was right.</i>

1070
01:02:45,442 --> 01:02:47,579
<i>Maybe I was feeling
sorry for myself.</i>

1071
01:02:50,047 --> 01:02:52,480
<i>You know, if things are gonna
break my way...</i>

1072
01:02:52,482 --> 01:02:55,317
<i>I needed to force the action.</i>

1073
01:02:55,319 --> 01:02:57,320
<i>I mean, if you're gonna push my
back up against the wall...</i>

1074
01:02:57,322 --> 01:03:02,057
<i>then it's fight or flight,
it's kill or be killed.</i>

1075
01:03:02,059 --> 01:03:06,128
<i>It's bases loaded, bottom
of the ninth...</i>

1076
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:08,398
<i>and I'll be damned if I'm gonna
be blackmailed...</i>

1077
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,099
<i>by some bitch-ass
motherfucker...</i>

1078
01:03:10,101 --> 01:03:12,938
<i>who's trying to fuck it up
for everybody else.</i>

1079
01:04:15,370 --> 01:04:18,571
What the fuck, dude!? Were you
even paying attention, man?

1080
01:04:20,508 --> 01:04:23,178
One fucking job.

1081
01:04:28,216 --> 01:04:31,250
What, are you still pissed
about the TV?

1082
01:04:31,252 --> 01:04:35,425
Fine... be mad at me,
I don't give a shit.

1083
01:04:37,693 --> 01:04:40,092
Why were you in Mr. Smith's
house?

1084
01:04:40,094 --> 01:04:42,130
- I was looking for something.
- What?

1085
01:04:43,264 --> 01:04:45,701
I don't know, anything.

1086
01:04:46,768 --> 01:04:49,101
- Does he owe you money?
- No.

1087
01:04:49,103 --> 01:04:51,170
And you still broke into his
house?

1088
01:04:51,172 --> 01:04:53,306
Yeah, I did.

1089
01:04:53,308 --> 01:04:56,176
If he doesn't owe you money,
then doesn't it make it illegal?

1090
01:04:56,178 --> 01:04:58,312
You know, I don't know
what to say, okay?

1091
01:04:58,314 --> 01:05:00,080
I don't know how he knows
about this TV...

1092
01:05:00,082 --> 01:05:04,819
and it's putting me in a very
fucking bad place.

1093
01:05:04,821 --> 01:05:06,523
Fuck!

1094
01:05:08,191 --> 01:05:11,825
Some bullshit always happens.
I get kicked in the face.

1095
01:05:11,827 --> 01:05:14,294
You want to know why I never
made it to the majors?

1096
01:05:14,296 --> 01:05:16,263
You want to know why
I'm not in the show?

1097
01:05:16,265 --> 01:05:18,198
Because my dad got fucked up
one night...

1098
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,735
and he got behind the wheel
of a car and he killed someone.

1099
01:05:20,737 --> 01:05:22,639
He just fucking ran 'em over.

1100
01:05:25,308 --> 01:05:27,842
My mom split, I had to come home
and give up my dream...

1101
01:05:27,844 --> 01:05:30,781
just to help him with
his fucking trial.

1102
01:05:32,482 --> 01:05:35,119
And I don't have fucking shit!

1103
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:46,095
I'm sorry, that was depressing.

1104
01:05:46,097 --> 01:05:48,566
I promised your mother I wasn't
gonna be depressing.

1105
01:05:53,238 --> 01:05:56,305
I know how he knows
about the TV.

1106
01:05:56,307 --> 01:05:57,510
What?

1107
01:05:59,544 --> 01:06:02,745
He comes over to see
my mom some nights.

1108
01:06:02,747 --> 01:06:05,481
Matt Smith spends the night
at your house.

1109
01:06:05,483 --> 01:06:07,182
He doesn't spend the night.

1110
01:06:07,184 --> 01:06:09,353
He comes over after I'm in bed
and leaves...

1111
01:06:09,355 --> 01:06:10,654
before I wake up in the morning.

1112
01:06:10,656 --> 01:06:11,855
Yeah, but him and your mom,
they're...

1113
01:06:11,857 --> 01:06:13,791
- Yeah.
- Are you sure about this?

1114
01:06:13,793 --> 01:06:15,226
I know what it sounds like.

1115
01:06:15,228 --> 01:06:17,661
Why didn't you tell me before?

1116
01:06:17,663 --> 01:06:19,295
I figured if you knew...

1117
01:06:19,297 --> 01:06:22,199
you wouldn't want to hang
out anymore.

1118
01:06:22,201 --> 01:06:25,168
Hey, hey, man, let's get
something straight here, okay?

1119
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:28,438
I don't like your mom,
like not even in the least bit.

1120
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:31,141
I mean, I'm sure she's a great
mom to you and all...

1121
01:06:31,143 --> 01:06:34,646
but me and her, there is nothing
going on there.

1122
01:06:34,648 --> 01:06:37,584
Me and you, we're friends, man.

1123
01:06:38,751 --> 01:06:40,417
So you're not mad?

1124
01:06:40,419 --> 01:06:44,256
No! This is fantastic, dude.

1125
01:06:44,258 --> 01:06:46,624
- It is?
- Yeah!

1126
01:06:46,626 --> 01:06:51,162
Holy shit.

1127
01:07:13,687 --> 01:07:16,591
Pretty raucous crowd, huh?

1128
01:07:18,426 --> 01:07:19,959
Yep.

1129
01:07:19,961 --> 01:07:21,727
So that thing we talked
about at the bar...

1130
01:07:21,729 --> 01:07:23,766
no impact on you.

1131
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,334
You know, I had to bribe
the kid's coach...

1132
01:07:27,336 --> 01:07:28,635
to get him on the mound?

1133
01:07:28,637 --> 01:07:31,771
What does that have to
do with anything?

1134
01:07:31,773 --> 01:07:33,340
You being the commissioner...

1135
01:07:33,342 --> 01:07:37,443
I just figured you could get
him on the mound.

1136
01:07:37,445 --> 01:07:39,845
Why would I do that?

1137
01:07:39,847 --> 01:07:41,948
Thought maybe you'd want to do
him a favor.

1138
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:46,156
You know, seein's how you're
fucking his mom, and all.

1139
01:07:48,357 --> 01:07:50,294
It really is the least
you could do.

1140
01:07:53,863 --> 01:07:56,698
That is just blatantly not true.

1141
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,669
Hmm.

1142
01:08:16,586 --> 01:08:17,821
What do you want?

1143
01:08:19,924 --> 01:08:22,394
I just want you to do
the right thing.

1144
01:08:37,809 --> 01:08:39,508
Let's go, Brad. You got this,
buddy.

1145
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:41,680
You got it, bub! Come on, now!

1146
01:08:42,648 --> 01:08:44,280
Strike!

1147
01:08:44,282 --> 01:08:46,982
Are you kidding me, ump?
Down by his fucking ankles!

1148
01:08:46,984 --> 01:08:48,955
Keep it consistent, let's go!

1149
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:53,022
What are you swinging at, Brad?

1150
01:08:53,024 --> 01:08:57,294
Come on now, keep your head
in there, what the fuck?

1151
01:08:57,296 --> 01:08:59,799
Keep it consistent, let's go.

1152
01:09:47,882 --> 01:09:50,449
How do you look at that pitch,
huh?

1153
01:09:50,451 --> 01:09:52,018
You want to play fucking
Tee-ball again?

1154
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:53,219
No.

1155
01:09:53,221 --> 01:09:55,421
Because I can get you a tee
and a ball and we can go...

1156
01:09:55,423 --> 01:09:59,125
hit off that, because you can't
seem to hit a ball without it.

1157
01:09:59,127 --> 01:10:02,028
Stop it, stop crying,
you Sally, man up!

1158
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:03,762
I can't stop, you're yelling
at me.

1159
01:10:03,764 --> 01:10:06,631
You cost me 200 bucks. You're
gonna make it up.

1160
01:10:06,633 --> 01:10:08,369
I will, I promise.

1161
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:11,841
You're damn right, you will!
Now get in the fucking car.

1162
01:10:14,477 --> 01:10:17,514
What are you looking at?
Mind your fucking business.

1163
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:26,953
Hey, kid.

1164
01:10:26,955 --> 01:10:29,390
Beaches, back the kid up for me,
will you?

1165
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:31,057
All right.

1166
01:10:31,059 --> 01:10:33,660
- What's up?
- Can we talk?

1167
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:34,829
Sure.

1168
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:36,830
Maybe not in front of everyone.

1169
01:10:36,832 --> 01:10:38,568
All right.

1170
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:48,446
What's up?

1171
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:52,480
- Can we stop?
- Stop what?

1172
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:54,481
Betting on games.

1173
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:58,120
Aw, buddy, you were never
bettin' on games, man.

1174
01:10:58,122 --> 01:11:03,058
Yeah, but will <i>you</i> stop?

1175
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:04,826
- No.
- Please?

1176
01:11:04,828 --> 01:11:06,562
No, sorry, pal, it's not
gonna happen.

1177
01:11:06,564 --> 01:11:08,830
You have to stop.

1178
01:11:08,832 --> 01:11:12,802
Why? What's gotten into you?

1179
01:11:12,804 --> 01:11:16,571
It's not fun anymore.

1180
01:11:16,573 --> 01:11:17,807
How is it not fun?

1181
01:11:17,809 --> 01:11:20,710
You're actually playing
well for the first time.

1182
01:11:20,712 --> 01:11:23,712
I don't know.

1183
01:11:23,714 --> 01:11:26,449
What then, you want to go back
to the way it was before...

1184
01:11:26,451 --> 01:11:27,983
where you're sitting on the
bench...

1185
01:11:27,985 --> 01:11:30,019
and everybody's calling you
names? Is that what you want?

1186
01:11:30,021 --> 01:11:31,688
No.

1187
01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:33,956
I'm sorry, I'm just confused,
what, like so...

1188
01:11:33,958 --> 01:11:35,724
you have friends now and you're
pitching well...

1189
01:11:35,726 --> 01:11:37,861
you want to forget about the guy
who got you there? Is that it?

1190
01:11:37,863 --> 01:11:39,629
No.

1191
01:11:39,631 --> 01:11:42,064
I taught you how to pitch.

1192
01:11:42,066 --> 01:11:44,001
You think anyone else would
have taken the time to do that?

1193
01:11:44,003 --> 01:11:46,503
- I don't know.
- I do, the answer is no.

1194
01:11:46,505 --> 01:11:49,105
Your whole life and no one ever
helped you pitch...

1195
01:11:49,107 --> 01:11:51,609
and then I come along and I help
you out and what...

1196
01:11:51,611 --> 01:11:53,881
you're gonna take the other
guy's side?

1197
01:11:55,949 --> 01:11:59,452
Is this how you treat your
friends? Huh?

1198
01:12:09,095 --> 01:12:13,899
Hey, Mickey, I got the Dundalk
lines.

1199
01:12:13,901 --> 01:12:16,834
Yeah, Knights are even money.

1200
01:12:16,836 --> 01:12:19,036
You want NBA also?

1201
01:12:19,038 --> 01:12:24,176
All right, ten grand on the
Knights.

1202
01:12:24,178 --> 01:12:28,012
Yeah, Kid Houston looks good.

1203
01:12:28,014 --> 01:12:30,516
Okay.

1204
01:12:30,518 --> 01:12:34,056
I got you down for it, Mick.
Ten G's.

1205
01:12:34,989 --> 01:12:36,524
Duly noted, Mick.

1206
01:12:49,804 --> 01:12:51,539
Hey.

1207
01:12:54,542 --> 01:12:57,980
Look, I'm...

1208
01:12:58,847 --> 01:13:00,984
Pitch a good game, huh?

1209
01:13:34,051 --> 01:13:36,786
- Zibs.
- Adam.

1210
01:13:46,697 --> 01:13:49,767
Outfield back up, good hitter!

1211
01:13:55,372 --> 01:13:57,006
Smart money's on Houston, huh?

1212
01:13:57,008 --> 01:13:59,611
Guess it depends on
what you consider smart.

1213
01:14:01,845 --> 01:14:03,980
Well, the number came in low,
so I figure you'd dropped...

1214
01:14:03,982 --> 01:14:06,082
the line by a few runs because
you're thinking...

1215
01:14:06,084 --> 01:14:07,620
Houston's bringing the goods.

1216
01:14:10,288 --> 01:14:14,257
Plus, Nick Spada had a birthday
party last night.

1217
01:14:14,259 --> 01:14:16,892
It was a sleep over and
half the Bears team was there.

1218
01:14:16,894 --> 01:14:18,728
That so?

1219
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:21,865
Yeah, they were probably staying
up really late...

1220
01:14:21,867 --> 01:14:24,637
watching movies, getting real
tired, so...

1221
01:14:31,645 --> 01:14:34,214
Boy, he really hung that one
over the plate.

1222
01:14:36,248 --> 01:14:38,883
Hey, hey, playing catch.

1223
01:15:02,008 --> 01:15:03,744
Throw the curve, kid.

1224
01:15:11,918 --> 01:15:15,122
They shouldn't have pitched him
on such short notice.

1225
01:15:20,995 --> 01:15:22,929
Hey, kid, kid...

1226
01:15:22,931 --> 01:15:27,066
you thinking about doing any
of the things we worked on?

1227
01:15:27,068 --> 01:15:29,237
Fine, suit yourself.

1228
01:15:33,942 --> 01:15:37,243
<i>It was ugly, pretty
much sold the other team...</i>

1229
01:15:37,245 --> 01:15:39,846
<i>prime real estate on home
plate.</i>

1230
01:15:39,848 --> 01:15:42,849
<i>Didn't throw the curve ball
once.</i>

1231
01:15:42,851 --> 01:15:45,919
<i>Didn't do a damn thing
we worked on.</i>

1232
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:48,955
<i>Stubborn, little shit.</i>

1233
01:15:48,957 --> 01:15:51,726
<i>Couldn't have picked a worse
game to stick it to me, either.</i>

1234
01:15:51,728 --> 01:15:55,863
<i>I had more money on this one
than the Super Bowl.</i>

1235
01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:58,899
<i>And look, maybe I was wearing
a pair of those...</i>

1236
01:15:58,901 --> 01:16:01,968
<i>rose-colored glasses when
I set the line.</i>

1237
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:04,972
<i>Maybe this kid never
had it in the first place.</i>

1238
01:16:04,974 --> 01:16:09,777
<i>Either way, it didn't look
good.</i>

1239
01:16:09,779 --> 01:16:12,884
<i>And the natives, they got
restless.</i>

1240
01:16:18,421 --> 01:16:22,156
<i>Lucky for me, Smitty caved and
cancelled the whole season...</i>

1241
01:16:22,158 --> 01:16:23,491
<i>before the game ended.</i>

1242
01:16:25,395 --> 01:16:27,995
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1243
01:16:27,997 --> 01:16:31,434
That's it, that's it, enough!
Enough!

1244
01:16:31,436 --> 01:16:35,170
<i>And well, if nobody
loses the game...</i>

1245
01:16:35,172 --> 01:16:37,139
<i>and nobody loses a bet...</i>

1246
01:16:37,141 --> 01:16:40,143
<i>we have ourselves a push and we
can all walk away...</i>

1247
01:16:40,145 --> 01:16:43,211
<i>with our heads held high and
our wallets the same weight.</i>

1248
01:16:43,213 --> 01:16:46,385
<i>No harm, no foul.</i>

1249
01:16:54,859 --> 01:16:56,496
You need a ride?

1250
01:16:59,932 --> 01:17:01,201
Here.

1251
01:17:05,905 --> 01:17:07,340
We're all square.

1252
01:17:39,872 --> 01:17:43,173
<i>So, all said and done...</i>

1253
01:17:43,175 --> 01:17:46,881
<i>looks like I made it out
of this whole mess unscathed.</i>

1254
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:52,918
<i>I managed to collect most
of my outstanding debts.</i>

1255
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:56,522
<i>Put a little extra scratch in
my pocket and shit...</i>

1256
01:17:56,524 --> 01:17:58,794
<i>walk away in better shape
than before it all started.</i>

1257
01:18:06,067 --> 01:18:09,469
<i>All said and done, it puts me
in the black...</i>

1258
01:18:09,471 --> 01:18:14,073
<i>which is all you can ever
ask for.</i>

1259
01:18:14,075 --> 01:18:19,045
<i>So yeah, there you go,
that's my story.</i>

1260
01:18:19,047 --> 01:18:23,983
<i>As for basketball lines,
playoffs look predictable...</i>

1261
01:18:23,985 --> 01:18:27,586
<i>this year, might have to jump
the line on the favorites...</i>

1262
01:18:27,588 --> 01:18:30,656
<i>a point or two, since it's
top-heavy.</i>

1263
01:18:30,658 --> 01:18:33,894
<i>You know, local gamblers like
to play the favorites...</i>

1264
01:18:33,896 --> 01:18:35,962
<i>so knowing that, I gotta
protect myself...</i>

1265
01:18:35,964 --> 01:18:38,198
<i>from all the action heading
one way.</i>

1266
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,399
Johnnie, let me help you
with that.

1267
01:18:39,401 --> 01:18:41,605
Get in the fucking house.

1268
01:18:43,338 --> 01:18:45,473
Fuck.

1269
01:18:45,475 --> 01:18:47,474
Come on, guys, what the fuck
is this?

1270
01:18:47,476 --> 01:18:48,675
Trying to throw games on us.

1271
01:18:48,677 --> 01:18:50,344
Mickey.

1272
01:18:50,346 --> 01:18:52,446
Yeah, play dumb like you didn't
have that kid throw the game.

1273
01:18:52,448 --> 01:18:55,015
How long have I known you guys?
Huh?

1274
01:18:55,017 --> 01:18:56,417
Why would I throw a fucking
game?

1275
01:18:56,419 --> 01:19:00,021
I can think of about
10,000 reasons.

1276
01:19:00,023 --> 01:19:02,690
Stevie, how many bets
have I let you slide on.

1277
01:19:02,692 --> 01:19:05,493
Sorry, Johnny, it doesn't look
so good.

1278
01:19:05,495 --> 01:19:06,662
I got you a job, man.

1279
01:19:06,664 --> 01:19:09,264
Johnny, you met my nephew,
right?

1280
01:19:09,266 --> 01:19:13,968
Yeah... fuck, ow!

1281
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:19,942
Shit. Whoo! God...

1282
01:19:19,944 --> 01:19:22,145
I'm telling you, okay, look,
the kid pitched bad...

1283
01:19:22,147 --> 01:19:23,445
because he was mad at me,
all right?

1284
01:19:23,447 --> 01:19:26,149
Fucking kids, right?

1285
01:19:26,151 --> 01:19:29,555
Fuck! God!

1286
01:19:30,721 --> 01:19:33,222
Where'd you say the cash was?

1287
01:19:33,224 --> 01:19:35,094
Oh, come on, you made
your point.

1288
01:19:38,697 --> 01:19:41,396
Oh fuck.

1289
01:19:41,398 --> 01:19:43,132
This makes us just about even.

1290
01:19:43,134 --> 01:19:46,970
Even? Come on, Mick, they didn't
even fucking finish the game.

1291
01:19:46,972 --> 01:19:48,571
I don't think you lost shit,
buddy.

1292
01:19:48,573 --> 01:19:50,507
Johnny, you know, if we let you
pull one over on us...

1293
01:19:50,509 --> 01:19:53,113
we gotta let everybody do it.

1294
01:19:54,579 --> 01:19:58,182
Oh, come on, guys, that's all
the money I got.

1295
01:19:58,184 --> 01:20:00,020
Here you go, dinner on us.

1296
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:06,992
Sorry, Johnny.

1297
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:20,073
Come on, man, just pee.

1298
01:20:31,150 --> 01:20:34,353
Come on, man, pee.

1299
01:20:34,355 --> 01:20:38,024
Daddy, is that Sparkle?

1300
01:20:38,026 --> 01:20:40,760
- Why does that guy have our dog?
- Ssh-ssh.

1301
01:20:40,762 --> 01:20:45,567
Um, guys, just wait right here,
please, okay?

1302
01:20:50,705 --> 01:20:52,174
John?

1303
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:56,275
Hey Bill, what's up?

1304
01:20:56,277 --> 01:20:58,548
Why do you have my dog, John?

1305
01:21:01,282 --> 01:21:02,748
Is that your dog?

1306
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:06,052
Did you break into my house
and steal my fucking kids' dog?

1307
01:21:06,054 --> 01:21:07,686
What? No, man.

1308
01:21:07,688 --> 01:21:10,656
Then why do you have
my kids' dog?

1309
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:13,325
You broke into my house and took
my kids' dog...

1310
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:14,727
because I owed you 500 bucks?

1311
01:21:14,729 --> 01:21:18,097
You owe me $600 bucks, man.

1312
01:21:18,099 --> 01:21:22,136
Do you have any idea of the
crying that has been going on...

1313
01:21:22,138 --> 01:21:27,340
in my house, for what,
to get even with me?

1314
01:21:27,342 --> 01:21:31,145
Well, I just... I mean...

1315
01:21:31,147 --> 01:21:35,415
- Daddy! Daddy, are you okay?
- Go back, girls, go back!

1316
01:21:35,417 --> 01:21:38,151
- I'm okay.
- Shit, man.

1317
01:21:38,153 --> 01:21:41,489
- Fuck, man.
- What'd you come at me for, man?

1318
01:21:41,491 --> 01:21:45,760
I just wanted my fucking dog.

1319
01:21:45,762 --> 01:21:49,363
Yeah, dude, take the dog, man.

1320
01:21:49,365 --> 01:21:53,037
There... there.

1321
01:21:55,538 --> 01:22:00,541
You know, I was gonna pay you...
but I got laid off from my job.

1322
01:22:00,543 --> 01:22:03,411
Times have been tough.

1323
01:22:03,413 --> 01:22:05,581
I didn't know that.

1324
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:07,583
You know, I saw you the other
day and you had on that...

1325
01:22:07,585 --> 01:22:11,254
new watch and I was like...
okay.

1326
01:22:11,256 --> 01:22:14,256
- This... this... this watch?
- Yeah.

1327
01:22:14,258 --> 01:22:20,462
This $75 watch, here, man,
you can have it.

1328
01:22:20,464 --> 01:22:22,297
I didn't know...

1329
01:22:22,299 --> 01:22:30,172
Hey, yeah, this is what they
give you when they lay you off.

1330
01:22:30,174 --> 01:22:33,243
As a way of saying thanks,
like...

1331
01:22:33,245 --> 01:22:36,480
"Hey, you don't have a job
or a pension...

1332
01:22:36,482 --> 01:22:39,583
"but here's a nice watch."

1333
01:22:39,585 --> 01:22:41,252
I'm sorry, I didn't know that.

1334
01:22:41,254 --> 01:22:43,689
Yeah, well...

1335
01:22:46,726 --> 01:22:51,261
Hey, you don't have
to pay me back, man.

1336
01:22:51,263 --> 01:22:52,632
We're all good.

1337
01:22:54,433 --> 01:22:59,273
You look like shit.
Take care of yourself.

1338
01:23:00,706 --> 01:23:05,312
Let's go, girls, come on,
Sparkle, come on.

1339
01:23:08,549 --> 01:23:10,382
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

1340
01:23:10,384 --> 01:23:12,185
Mm-hm...

1341
01:23:14,321 --> 01:23:16,655
Hey man, are you sure you don't
want something for your face?

1342
01:23:16,657 --> 01:23:18,326
Right on.

1343
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:24,330
Ain't Debbie working?

1344
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:26,464
Nah, she was, but she
had to leave early.

1345
01:23:26,466 --> 01:23:27,933
Oh.

1346
01:23:27,935 --> 01:23:31,269
It was some emergency
with her kid.

1347
01:23:31,271 --> 01:23:32,604
What happened?

1348
01:23:32,606 --> 01:23:34,874
Apparently, he broke into
her ex-husband's house.

1349
01:23:34,876 --> 01:23:36,509
- You know Hooper, right?
- Yeah.

1350
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:39,544
Yeah, well, kid was still in
there when his old man got home.

1351
01:23:39,546 --> 01:23:44,353
Get this, Hooper sees him and
beats the shit out of him.

1352
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:47,888
He told the cops he thought he
was robbing the place...

1353
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:52,395
but if you ask me, Hooper did it
to teach him a lesson.

1354
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:04,638
- Is he okay?
- Get the fuck away from my house.

1355
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,840
- Wait, wait, I just wanna know...
- I said get the fuck outta here!

1356
01:24:06,842 --> 01:24:08,542
- Just hang on a second.
- Leave.

1357
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:09,877
What? I want to know
if he's all right.

1358
01:24:09,879 --> 01:24:10,944
This is your fault.

1359
01:24:10,946 --> 01:24:12,145
- My fault?
- Yes.

1360
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:14,282
You know what? Maybe if you
spent more time at his games...

1361
01:24:14,284 --> 01:24:15,649
than with the fucking
commissioner...

1362
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:17,385
we'd be talking about something
else.

1363
01:24:17,387 --> 01:24:21,322
Fuck, god... fucking...

1364
01:24:21,324 --> 01:24:24,391
He's not your kid, okay?
He is my kid!

1365
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:27,261
You think because you hung out
with him for a couple of weeks...

1366
01:24:27,263 --> 01:24:29,396
and taught him how to pitch that
somehow he's your kid?

1367
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:32,368
He's not. You have no idea what
it's like being a parent...

1368
01:24:32,370 --> 01:24:35,671
to have to put food on the table
and pay rent.

1369
01:24:35,673 --> 01:24:37,472
Explain to him why his dad
is a piece of shit.

1370
01:24:37,474 --> 01:24:38,806
You know what? It's not my fault
his Dad's...

1371
01:24:38,808 --> 01:24:40,542
- a fucking piece of shit.
- You used him.

1372
01:24:40,544 --> 01:24:43,279
How the fuck did I use him?
I told you about the gambling.

1373
01:24:43,281 --> 01:24:45,948
Nobody gives a shit about
your gambling!

1374
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:47,583
How the fuck am I using him?

1375
01:24:47,585 --> 01:24:50,953
Because you were there when it
was ballgames and pizza.

1376
01:24:50,955 --> 01:24:53,321
Where were you when
he needed you...

1377
01:24:53,323 --> 01:24:57,693
when he was so upset that he
broke into his dad's house?

1378
01:24:57,695 --> 01:25:00,664
I have been there for that kid.

1379
01:25:00,666 --> 01:25:04,566
My son doesn't need another man
in his life letting him down...

1380
01:25:04,568 --> 01:25:10,973
and I knew from the second I saw
you sitting at my table...

1381
01:25:10,975 --> 01:25:13,977
it was only a matter of time...

1382
01:25:13,979 --> 01:25:15,712
before you would turn
your back on him.

1383
01:25:15,714 --> 01:25:18,982
- Jesus, what happened to you?
- Nothing.

1384
01:25:18,984 --> 01:25:21,854
Wh... what are you doing?

1385
01:25:37,869 --> 01:25:42,005
Where's my shit? Where's my...
where's my bat, Dad?

1386
01:25:42,007 --> 01:25:43,675
What do you want that for?

1387
01:25:43,677 --> 01:25:46,444
Hey, hey, look, why don't you
take a deep breath...

1388
01:25:46,446 --> 01:25:50,614
and just calm down for a second
before you do something stupid.

1389
01:25:50,616 --> 01:25:55,586
Huh? Will you hold the fuck on!
Sit down for a second!

1390
01:25:55,588 --> 01:25:57,922
I meant to do it!

1391
01:25:57,924 --> 01:25:59,491
You meant to do what?

1392
01:25:59,493 --> 01:26:01,893
I was drunk when I ran Bernie
Gallagher over...

1393
01:26:01,895 --> 01:26:03,494
but I meant to do it...

1394
01:26:03,496 --> 01:26:05,497
he was having an affair
with your mother.

1395
01:26:05,499 --> 01:26:09,401
You're just telling me this shit
now.

1396
01:26:09,403 --> 01:26:12,637
Bernie and I drank at the same
pub and the night I found out...

1397
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:14,740
I look at his fucking face
across the bar...

1398
01:26:14,742 --> 01:26:16,409
and I start going for him.

1399
01:26:16,411 --> 01:26:18,444
Bernie starts running away
and I'm chasing him.

1400
01:26:18,446 --> 01:26:20,046
I think, "This is fucking
crazy."

1401
01:26:20,048 --> 01:26:23,416
So I tell myself, go outside,
go outside, calm down.

1402
01:26:23,418 --> 01:26:25,385
So I go outside and I'm sitting
in my car...

1403
01:26:25,387 --> 01:26:26,785
but I'm getting more
and more upset.

1404
01:26:26,787 --> 01:26:29,454
And then Bernie comes out
of the bar.

1405
01:26:29,456 --> 01:26:31,458
And you ran him over
with your fucking car?

1406
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:37,033
Well, I didn't plan it! It
boiled me over, I lost my shit.

1407
01:26:38,666 --> 01:26:42,802
- And Mom?
- She left.

1408
01:26:42,804 --> 01:26:46,039
She... she kept her mouth shut
during the whole trial process.

1409
01:26:46,041 --> 01:26:47,607
Thank God, God bless her...

1410
01:26:47,609 --> 01:26:50,076
because it could have been
worse, I think.

1411
01:26:50,078 --> 01:26:53,646
Maybe she felt bad for me,
I don't know.

1412
01:26:53,648 --> 01:26:55,650
A little guilty maybe.

1413
01:26:55,652 --> 01:27:01,492
Anyway, she couldn't stay here,
she left.

1414
01:27:04,493 --> 01:27:05,692
You...

1415
01:27:05,694 --> 01:27:11,433
Look, I spent 10 years in prison
for doing something stupid.

1416
01:27:11,435 --> 01:27:14,201
Now look at me, will you?
Look at me.

1417
01:27:14,203 --> 01:27:17,541
This is what getting even
looks like.

1418
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:21,146
Get the fuck out of my way.

1419
01:27:24,181 --> 01:27:25,714
Come on.

1420
01:27:27,717 --> 01:27:31,921
<i>Look, I know
what you're thinking.</i>

1421
01:27:31,923 --> 01:27:34,989
<i>I didn't think it was heading
this way either...</i>

1422
01:27:34,991 --> 01:27:36,427
<i>but here we are.</i>

1423
01:27:42,467 --> 01:27:46,873
<i>And tell me, what would you
do if you're in my shoes?</i>

1424
01:27:50,142 --> 01:27:52,478
<i>Would you let it slide?</i>

1425
01:27:55,746 --> 01:27:58,017
<i>Maybe you're a better person
than I am.</i>

1426
01:28:56,177 --> 01:28:59,912
Come here. Do we know each
other?

1427
01:28:59,914 --> 01:29:03,148
- Why?
- Why?

1428
01:29:03,150 --> 01:29:05,520
Because you keep eye-fucking
me from across the room.

1429
01:29:09,591 --> 01:29:14,661
Went to high school together,
I'm John Zbikowsky.

1430
01:29:14,663 --> 01:29:18,899
I played baseball.

1431
01:29:18,901 --> 01:29:22,702
Oh shit, Zibs, yeah.

1432
01:29:22,704 --> 01:29:25,906
Sorry, man, I didn't recognize
you, you look like shit.

1433
01:29:25,908 --> 01:29:29,710
What happened? You all right?

1434
01:29:29,712 --> 01:29:31,647
Fine, man.

1435
01:29:33,115 --> 01:29:34,348
So what? You just came here...

1436
01:29:34,350 --> 01:29:37,617
to catch up on old times
or something.

1437
01:29:37,619 --> 01:29:39,121
No.

1438
01:29:40,755 --> 01:29:44,225
What's up, then, what's
with the bat?

1439
01:29:44,227 --> 01:29:46,796
You gotta ball game
or something?

1440
01:29:53,603 --> 01:29:55,369
Why are you looking at me like
that, man? You got something...

1441
01:29:55,371 --> 01:29:59,009
You got some business with me
or something?

1442
01:30:03,847 --> 01:30:06,013
We got a problem? I mean...

1443
01:30:06,015 --> 01:30:08,720
You know my ex-wife
or something?

1444
01:30:13,824 --> 01:30:17,162
No, nope.

1445
01:30:22,766 --> 01:30:23,932
Softball game.

1446
01:30:25,636 --> 01:30:28,639
One too many beers, that's all.

1447
01:30:31,042 --> 01:30:34,780
Yeah, well...

1448
01:30:36,215 --> 01:30:39,851
fucking take care of yourself,
dude, you look like shit.

1449
01:30:44,756 --> 01:30:46,158
Hm.

1450
01:31:39,312 --> 01:31:41,480
What are you doing?

1451
01:31:41,482 --> 01:31:44,383
I'm trying to be a
"leaves-a-note" guy.

1452
01:31:44,385 --> 01:31:46,186
Hm.

1453
01:31:46,188 --> 01:31:48,387
Last time I was here, I didn't
really do the right thing.

1454
01:31:48,389 --> 01:31:51,990
Yeah, I know. I've read it after
Mr. Mooney threw it on ground.

1455
01:31:51,992 --> 01:31:54,127
And you let me carry on like
this the whole time?

1456
01:31:54,129 --> 01:31:56,730
Yeah, I guess so.

1457
01:31:56,732 --> 01:31:58,734
I guess I just didn't care.

1458
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:06,710
What happened to you?

1459
01:32:08,845 --> 01:32:10,878
I think I got what was coming
to me.

1460
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:13,717
Yeah, me, too.

1461
01:32:16,952 --> 01:32:19,419
I think maybe I gave you some
bad advice...

1462
01:32:19,421 --> 01:32:21,755
these past couple of weeks.

1463
01:32:21,757 --> 01:32:25,860
You don't go breaking into
houses, no matter what.

1464
01:32:25,862 --> 01:32:27,995
Okay.

1465
01:32:27,997 --> 01:32:33,067
Here, give that to your
mom for the hospital bill.

1466
01:32:33,069 --> 01:32:34,469
Okay.

1467
01:32:34,471 --> 01:32:36,774
It's not a lot, but it's
all I got at the moment.

1468
01:32:39,943 --> 01:32:42,143
Want to know the real reason
I quit playing baseball?

1469
01:32:42,145 --> 01:32:43,978
You told me about your dad.

1470
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:46,447
No, that's not it.

1471
01:32:46,449 --> 01:32:49,017
I wasn't good enough.

1472
01:32:49,019 --> 01:32:52,787
I was getting knocked
around in single A.

1473
01:32:52,789 --> 01:32:54,556
Yeah, I could have worked hard
and got better...

1474
01:32:54,558 --> 01:32:56,792
but that shit with my dad
happened...

1475
01:32:56,794 --> 01:32:59,796
and it's just easier to quit.

1476
01:32:59,798 --> 01:33:04,000
So I came home and I took
over his book.

1477
01:33:04,002 --> 01:33:06,202
My whole life, I've been taking
the easy route...

1478
01:33:06,204 --> 01:33:11,207
and I think maybe I used you as
part of that easy route...

1479
01:33:11,209 --> 01:33:13,509
and I apologize.

1480
01:33:13,511 --> 01:33:16,945
- It's cool.
- No, it's not cool.

1481
01:33:16,947 --> 01:33:20,551
I'm sorry, friends don't do
that to friends.

1482
01:33:20,553 --> 01:33:23,921
I got to pitch, I got in a
fight, I bet on horses.

1483
01:33:23,923 --> 01:33:27,356
This is the best fucking
summer of my life.

1484
01:33:27,358 --> 01:33:29,495
Me, too.

1485
01:33:31,463 --> 01:33:34,230
Never got your name on that
wall, though.

1486
01:33:34,232 --> 01:33:36,566
It's alright.

1487
01:33:36,568 --> 01:33:39,035
So what are you going to do now?

1488
01:33:39,037 --> 01:33:44,308
I don't know, probably take
a job, I guess.

1489
01:33:44,310 --> 01:33:47,011
You still gonna take bets?

1490
01:33:47,013 --> 01:33:50,214
I say no now, but football
season's gonna roll around...

1491
01:33:50,216 --> 01:33:53,353
- I probably got to reassess.
- Yeah.

1492
01:33:54,888 --> 01:33:56,987
What are you gonna do
with the rest of the summer?

1493
01:33:56,989 --> 01:33:58,255
Don't know.

1494
01:33:58,257 --> 01:34:01,191
Might want to figure that out
before school starts back up.

1495
01:34:01,193 --> 01:34:05,532
Next season, will you come
see me pitch?

1496
01:34:07,334 --> 01:34:09,335
Shit, yeah.

1497
01:34:27,587 --> 01:34:32,291
Hey, we got a letter
from a guy named Zibs.

1498
01:34:32,293 --> 01:34:34,894
Is that the guy you know
from baseball?

1499
01:34:34,896 --> 01:34:37,899
Wait, no, no, let me,
uh, let me...

1500
01:35:53,043 --> 01:35:56,980
<i>All said and done, yeah...</i>

1501
01:35:56,982 --> 01:36:01,086
<i>I have done some shitty things
in my life.</i>

1502
01:36:07,659 --> 01:36:11,664
<i>Aw, fuck it, I never said
I was perfect.</i>

1503
01:36:21,444 --> 01:36:23,072
