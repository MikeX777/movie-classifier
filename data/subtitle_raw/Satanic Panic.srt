1
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:59,210
Is it supposed to take
this long?

2
00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:26,866
Mom, I...
Wait. I-I know you're mad.

3
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:28,530
But, Mom, I-I didn't even
want to do it.

4
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:29,993
Please.
Mom.

5
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:31,874
Mom... Mom... Mom!

6
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:36,122
Oh, fuck.
No, no, no, no.

7
00:02:36,173 --> 00:02:38,290
No, no, no, no, no.

I told you.

19
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,314
I shouldn't have shown you guys.

20
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:45,778
Oh.

21
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,364
Delivering pizza is a calling
whose techniques

22
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:50,199
- are passed down orally...
- And anally.

23
00:03:50,247 --> 00:03:52,614
...from generation
to generation.

24
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,248
This is hazing.

25
00:03:54,293 --> 00:03:56,205
Great.

26
00:03:56,253 --> 00:03:59,291
Got a double going to S Town,
triple going west,

27
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,673
and the Presbyterians are having
a lock-in.

28
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:02,958
Ooh!
I get the pesky Presbies.

29
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,502
Hey, Karim, you're west.

30
00:04:05,554 --> 00:04:08,171
Young lady, S Town.

31
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:10,887
Ain't nothing good happening
in S Town, baby.

32
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:27,191
Samster.

33
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:28,484
Yeah?

34
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:29,777
You owe me $5.

35
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:31,579
For what?

36
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,912
Deposit on the thermal bag.

37
00:04:32,957 --> 00:04:35,870
Oh.
But I need that $5 for gas.

38
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:04,019
Look. It'll be
right there when you're done.

39
00:05:13,998 --> 00:05:16,832
Hey. I don't want
my girlfriend crying.

40
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:18,287
I'm not your girlfriend.

41
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,247
You keep calling me.

42
00:05:20,296 --> 00:05:21,377
For a job.

43
00:05:21,964 --> 00:05:23,080
And here you are.

44
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:25,540
Thanks.
It's great.

45
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:26,709
You owe me.

46
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,843
Please move.
I'm getting wet.

47
00:05:28,888 --> 00:05:31,847
I have that effect on all women.

48
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:33,553
You should meditate.

49
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:36,890
Real universe?
It's in there.

50
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,062
Boop!

51
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,601
Wait.
Why did you call it S Town?

52
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:45,814
Scrooge Town.

53
00:05:45,863 --> 00:05:47,063
Never tips.

54
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:49,272
Shit.

55
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:57,455
Two fuzzy bunnies.

56
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:18,931
Um, did you order from Home Run?

57
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,141
Righteous.
Can you grab one end?

58
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,273
Oh, I-I have another delivery.

59
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:25,935
- What's your name?
- Sam.

60
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,729
Mine too.
What are the chances?

61
00:06:28,781 --> 00:06:30,488
You have to give me a hand.

62
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:32,775
- It's the code of the Sams.
- Is that a thing?

63
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,159
There are 7 million Sams
in America,

64
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:36,681
and you're the first one
I've ever met

65
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:38,571
who doesn't know the code
of the Sams?

66
00:06:38,624 --> 00:06:40,957
- I-I...
- Sams helping Sams.

67
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,412
That's our jam.

68
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:44,749
All right.

69
00:06:44,797 --> 00:06:46,333
All right. Sweet.
Grab this end.

70
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:51,714
Uh, that'll be $24.75.

71
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,050
- Thank you.
- Do you have to go?

72
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:57,182
Well, after you pay, I go.

73
00:06:57,226 --> 00:06:59,263
Piss.
Do you have to piss?

74
00:06:59,311 --> 00:07:01,473
- What?
- I have this guy in here,

75
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:04,890
and he wants me to piss
on his face, but I already went.

76
00:07:04,942 --> 00:07:06,604
I'll pay you $12.

77
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:09,269
Uh... no?

78
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:11,153
Prude.

79
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:16,317
I thought you was Mexicans.

80
00:07:17,663 --> 00:07:19,780
Um, that'll be $8.98.

81
00:07:24,503 --> 00:07:25,503
My change?

82
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:30,753
It's laundry day.

83
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,712
My Richard doesn't need this
in heaven.

84
00:07:35,764 --> 00:07:38,097
- Oh. Oh, no, no, no.
- And it's exactly your size.

85
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:40,805
- I-I don't need this.
- Bless your heart.

86
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,231
Oh!

87
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:50,519
From one Sam to another,
you rule.

88
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:06,204
It's expired.

89
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,744
In four hours, my total earnings

90
00:08:07,796 --> 00:08:10,413
are an expired
Applebee's coupon, a head cold,

91
00:08:10,466 --> 00:08:12,332
and a sweater that smells
like racism.

92
00:08:12,384 --> 00:08:13,591
It's your first day.

93
00:08:13,636 --> 00:08:15,593
I took this job for the tips.

94
00:08:15,638 --> 00:08:19,928
You need someone to make sure
you get the fat orders.

95
00:08:19,975 --> 00:08:21,386
You?

96
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:22,996
The only movies I watch
are documentaries,

97
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,103
and when I go to the gym,
I listen to books.

98
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:29,357
I can satisfy all your physical
<i>and</i> intellectual needs.

99
00:08:29,401 --> 00:08:31,688
I don't have any needs.

100
00:08:31,737 --> 00:08:34,320
You're uncomfortable
because I'm authentic.

101
00:08:34,365 --> 00:08:38,075
Delivery for Mill Basin.
Five pies in five.

102
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,235
That's outside our zone.

103
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:41,619
I'll do it.

104
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:50,204
- Where to, Mad Max?
- Uh, Mill Basin.

105
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:53,089
Five years ago,
I took an order to Mill Basin.

106
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,999
The fuckers stiffed me
for the tip

107
00:08:55,052 --> 00:08:57,169
<i>and</i> slammed the door
in my face.

108
00:08:57,221 --> 00:09:00,180
So I went through the window,
and everybody's boning...

109
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:04,093
like, dudes, chicks,
dogs and cats, a frog and shit.

110
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,386
So I'm in there getting it,
like, "Ribbit!"

111
00:09:06,438 --> 00:09:08,896
Like everybody's all, "Unh!
Unh!"

112
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:10,307
And I passed the hat.

113
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:12,692
Made $32.

114
00:09:14,238 --> 00:09:16,946
You go to Mill Basin
a delivery boy,

115
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,778
but you come back
a delivery man.

116
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:18,591
Hello?

117
00:10:20,345 --> 00:10:22,086
Home Run Pizza.

118
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:25,362
Hi.

119
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:39,915
It's my first night.

120
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,128
Sorry.

121
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:47,213
Okay.

122
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:48,598
Here you go.

123
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,099
Thank you.

124
00:11:51,728 --> 00:11:53,765
Oh, wait. My boss gets mad
if you don't sign.

125
00:12:05,075 --> 00:12:06,862
Thank you, sir,
and have a wonderful night

126
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,197
and enjoy your pi...

127
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:16,583
Oh.
Excuse me!

128
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:19,917
Excuse me, sir!
I think you forgot to tip!

129
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,011
Please, please, please,
please, please.

130
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:30,093
Please...

131
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,302
You stupid...

132
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,958
Hello?
Excuse me!

133
00:12:58,837 --> 00:13:01,250
I know you're home, sir!

134
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:30,255
We are gathered here tonight

135
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:33,262
to activate
our fullest potential.

136
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:38,392
For 17 years, we have achieved
unprecedented growth

137
00:14:38,437 --> 00:14:42,681
thanks to team unity
and personal productivity.

138
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:45,851
So I'm saying to you right now,

139
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:51,148
be prepared for a major
paradigm shift,

140
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,943
because today is nonreturnable.

141
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:59,205
I haven't built my career
because I needed to help others.

142
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:02,367
- Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon me.
- I haven't sacrificed

143
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:04,376
all I have
because I needed friends.

144
00:15:04,421 --> 00:15:09,712
I do what I do
because I love to make winners.

145
00:15:10,969 --> 00:15:12,801
Are you ready to be a winner?

146
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,633
- Yes!
- Excuse me. I'm sorry.

147
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:17,264
But did you see a guy with a big
mustache, kind of dead eyes?

148
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:21,098
Are you ready to take back
what you are owed?

149
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:23,980
- Yes!
- Are you ready to just do it?

150
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,936
- Yes!
- Who are you?

151
00:15:25,984 --> 00:15:27,191
I-I'm Sam.

152
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:28,601
What are you doing here?

153
00:15:28,653 --> 00:15:30,315
I delivered pizza
for a guy here,

154
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:32,821
but he didn't tip, and I need
that tip for gas money.

155
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:36,485
I mean, if everyone here gave
a quarter, that'd be like...

156
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,573
Wait.
You don't know anyone here?

157
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:40,659
I mean, that would be
like almost $10.

158
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,699
- Yes!
- Are you ready

159
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:46,370
to fully commit yourselves
to Satan?

160
00:15:46,421 --> 00:15:47,912
Yes!

161
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:50,456
- Everything helps.
- You can't be here.

162
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:52,546
Mill Basin is actually outside
our delivery zone.

163
00:15:52,594 --> 00:15:53,755
You have to go.

164
00:15:53,804 --> 00:15:57,343
Call forth the change driver!

165
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:00,638
We've... had a complication.

166
00:16:02,521 --> 00:16:05,639
Complications are just
opportunities in disguise.

167
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,183
Change driver was not as pure
as she appeared.

168
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,232
Can she be salvaged?

169
00:16:12,823 --> 00:16:14,485
She's no longer with us.

170
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:15,694
Seriously?

171
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,233
What did Samuel say?

172
00:16:17,285 --> 00:16:21,120
Samuel wasn't happy
with my hands-on approach,

173
00:16:21,164 --> 00:16:22,530
so I've put him somewhere

174
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,869
where he won't cause any...
backsliding.

175
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:27,251
This is Beltane, Danica.

176
00:16:27,295 --> 00:16:28,661
It is a full moon!

177
00:16:28,713 --> 00:16:30,921
We're summoning Baphomet.

178
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:33,424
We need a virgin.

179
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,176
Excuse me!

180
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:39,339
Um, sorry to interrupt
your party or, um, whatever,

181
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:42,805
but I'm the pizza guy...
oh, girl...

182
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:46,437
a-and someone here ordered five
large pies, one with sweet corn,

183
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:48,292
uh, and he paid with a card,
but he didn't tip.

184
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:51,605
So I just wanted to see if maybe
you guys would cover for him.

185
00:16:51,653 --> 00:16:53,519
I-I just don't think it's fair

186
00:16:53,572 --> 00:16:54,983
for me to drive
all the way out here

187
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:57,614
and not be able to cover
the cost of gas, so...

188
00:16:57,659 --> 00:16:59,116
Who are you?

189
00:16:59,161 --> 00:17:01,949
The pizza, uh, person.

190
00:17:01,997 --> 00:17:04,831
And what are you doing
in my house?

191
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,286
Look, you guys.

192
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:08,246
You may live
in this nice neighborhood,

193
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:11,038
and I deliver pizza,
but we're not so different.

194
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,331
I mean, I have to make a living,
just like you.

195
00:17:13,383 --> 00:17:16,251
So, you know, maybe if you could
pass the helmet,

196
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,044
the next time I'm busking
and someone says,

197
00:17:18,096 --> 00:17:20,634
"Hey, what's with those stuck-up
snobs in Mill Basin?"

198
00:17:20,682 --> 00:17:22,014
I'll say, "Hey. No.

199
00:17:22,058 --> 00:17:25,222
They're actually pretty cool,"
right?

200
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,559
Busking?

201
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,233
Yeah, uh,
I sing my own material...

202
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:34,690
like, folk songs...
down by the aquarium.

203
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:43,278
Are you by any chance...
a virgin?

204
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,743
Um, that's a very personal
question.

205
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,373
She's a virgin.

206
00:17:48,418 --> 00:17:50,330
Oh. Um, excuse me.

207
00:17:50,378 --> 00:17:53,337
Can you, um,
can you let me go, please?

208
00:17:53,381 --> 00:17:55,543
Excuse me. Hey. Hey.
Ow.

209
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,870
Guess you pissed off my bitch
whore of a wife as well.

210
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,413
Sorry.
Who are you?

211
00:18:32,462 --> 00:18:34,454
Who am I?

212
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:36,748
I own this house.
Who the hell are you?

213
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,792
Um, I delivered that pizza.

214
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,005
You packing heat?

215
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:42,886
You come with anyone else?

216
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:45,344
What about fighting skills...
judo, karate, Krav Maga,

217
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:48,135
Filipino knife fighting?

218
00:18:48,186 --> 00:18:50,803
All right.
Well, that was that.

219
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:58,145
Look, all I did
was ask for a tip.

220
00:18:58,196 --> 00:19:00,216
I-I mean, I probably shouldn't
have come in the house,

221
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,608
but it's my first night,
so, you know, lesson learned.

222
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,638
Do you have any idea
what's happening here tonight?

223
00:19:05,662 --> 00:19:09,406
Um, well, I work in a field
that pays $2.13 an hour

224
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:12,245
and my income is mostly based
off tips,

225
00:19:12,294 --> 00:19:14,752
but everyone in there got
pissed off when I asked for one.

226
00:19:14,796 --> 00:19:17,083
Okay, well, none of those people
are gonna tip you

227
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:20,091
because they're too busy
worshipping Satan,

228
00:19:20,135 --> 00:19:23,719
and tonight they are summoning
Baphomet.

229
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:24,970
Like the band?

230
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:26,881
Like the triple-faced god
of hell.

231
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,286
And they're probably gonna
kill us tonight.

232
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,721
Well, they're definitely killing
me.

233
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,512
They're probably gonna kill you.
I don't know.

234
00:19:34,524 --> 00:19:36,891
Oh, you must think
I'm a lot younger than I look.

235
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:39,936
I mean, Carl, my neighbor, he's
a Satanist and he's a vegan.

236
00:19:39,988 --> 00:19:42,355
They are gonna render my fat
to make candles.

237
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:44,319
Okay.
Uh, I need to get back to work.

238
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:48,077
They are gonna cut
your tongue out.

239
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:50,534
They are gonna jam needles
into your eyes,

240
00:19:50,582 --> 00:19:53,450
and that's them being merciful,
okay?

241
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:55,834
Just be happy
you're not a virgin.

242
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:58,496
I've spent the last 22 years
fending off horny dudes.

243
00:19:58,548 --> 00:20:00,005
I think I can handle

244
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,770
a bunch of sexually repressed
suburban dads.

245
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,214
Oh, my God.

246
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:07,092
Are you a virgin?

247
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,348
That's a very personal question.

248
00:20:09,392 --> 00:20:12,351
Christing hell.

249
00:20:12,395 --> 00:20:16,184
This night just keeps getting
better and better and better.

250
00:20:16,232 --> 00:20:17,473
Whoa. Hey.
Listen. Hey.

251
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:18,766
I need you to scrape together

252
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,275
whatever brain cells
you have left.

253
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,811
Rude.

254
00:20:21,863 --> 00:20:24,526
Baphomet needs a virgin womb
to be born.

255
00:20:24,574 --> 00:20:26,566
Okay? Do you understand
what I'm saying?

256
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:28,596
That's the only reason
you are alive right now, okay?

257
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,363
He is a big fucking demon
from hell,

258
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:34,532
and when that clock strikes
12:00, he is gonna rip you open!

259
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:36,871
I've seen that album cover.

260
00:20:39,214 --> 00:20:44,881
You have any idea why the rich
stay rich and you stay screwed?

261
00:20:44,928 --> 00:20:46,294
Mm, better healthcare.

262
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,928
Do you have any tools?

263
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:50,134
We're not going anywhere.

264
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:52,266
You should just accept that.

265
00:20:55,146 --> 00:20:56,512
You want a hit?

266
00:20:56,564 --> 00:20:59,648
Really good kush.
You won't feel a thing.

267
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,212
I've been on this delivery
for over an hour and a half.

268
00:21:01,236 --> 00:21:03,148
I'm probably fired.

269
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:04,437
Aha.

270
00:21:06,074 --> 00:21:07,781
My name is Samuel.

271
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:11,327
Oh. I'm Sam.
Cool. Same name.

272
00:21:11,996 --> 00:21:13,908
Don't worry.
I won't even scratch the frame.

273
00:21:13,957 --> 00:21:15,994
I suggest you stop fighting
this.

274
00:21:17,836 --> 00:21:20,078
I bet you have a lot
of boyfriends.

275
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,255
I mean, if you count the guy
who got me this job

276
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:25,444
and now wants me to put out
so he'll send me on better runs,

277
00:21:25,468 --> 00:21:27,835
then I think...
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

278
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:31,471
Listen.
They need to sacrifice a virgin.

279
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:34,721
No virgin, no sacrifice.

280
00:21:35,603 --> 00:21:37,515
Let me protect you.

281
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:40,523
- Oh!
- Come here.

282
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:48,197
Hey. I'm trying to save
your life, okay?

283
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:49,857
Stop fighting me here.

284
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,571
I'm trying to save...

285
00:21:54,164 --> 00:21:58,124
Yeah. I'm gonna save you
whether you like it or not.

286
00:22:02,547 --> 00:22:05,210
Look at what you made me do.
I'm a feminist!

287
00:22:16,227 --> 00:22:17,513
Oh!

288
00:22:23,526 --> 00:22:24,687
Duncan! Duncan! Duncan!

289
00:22:24,736 --> 00:22:26,193
Please... Please help me!
Please!

290
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,822
You are way out of line.

291
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:31,903
- I didn't hear...
- Put it down.

292
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,567
Now, you...

293
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,579
I'm...
I'm not even a gun person.

294
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,908
Please.

295
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:43,623
One way or another, they aren't
getting their virgin.

296
00:22:44,297 --> 00:22:46,505
Code of the Sams.
No. Code of the Sams.

297
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:24,744
And now the great work begins.

298
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:35,171
Oh, Samuel.

299
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:41,803
What did you do?

300
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:50,145
We were so close, Samuel.

301
00:23:51,573 --> 00:23:54,657
We were almost there.

302
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:02,786
Sadly, you only have yourself
to blame.

303
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:04,746
It's your fault.

304
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,715
All right.

305
00:24:18,683 --> 00:24:20,675
Where are ya?

306
00:24:21,352 --> 00:24:25,517
I know that soul's around here
somewhere.

307
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:27,431
A little lower.

308
00:24:27,483 --> 00:24:30,100
Little lower.

309
00:24:30,153 --> 00:24:31,689
Okay.

310
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:33,855
Now we're getting close.

311
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:36,068
There you are.

312
00:24:36,117 --> 00:24:37,904
All righty.

313
00:24:37,952 --> 00:24:41,445
Ooh. Oh, it's so slippery.

314
00:24:42,624 --> 00:24:44,661
Ah.
Okay.

315
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:46,450
There.

316
00:24:49,213 --> 00:24:50,875
Thank you.

317
00:24:53,301 --> 00:24:56,760
Run it under cold water and
bake it at 225 for 40 minutes.

318
00:24:56,804 --> 00:24:59,512
Pack it with bay leaf, black
peppercorn, and graveyard dirt.

319
00:24:59,557 --> 00:25:01,014
Use the big casserole tray.

320
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:03,012
Oh.
And, Danielle?

321
00:25:03,061 --> 00:25:04,393
Not my good tray.

322
00:25:05,647 --> 00:25:06,683
<i>I</i> think...

323
00:25:06,731 --> 00:25:08,893
Your job is not to think.

324
00:25:09,901 --> 00:25:12,860
Your job is to tell me
one thing, Gypsy.

325
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:16,655
Where the fuck is my virgin?

326
00:25:28,544 --> 00:25:31,582
Please. Please. Please help.
Help me.

327
00:25:34,884 --> 00:25:36,796
Oh, my gosh!
Are you okay?

328
00:25:36,844 --> 00:25:38,801
- Please help me.
- Of course you're not okay.

329
00:25:38,846 --> 00:25:40,178
What am I saying?
What happened?

330
00:25:40,223 --> 00:25:42,340
I got attacked.
Call 911, please.

331
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:47,810
Was it a gang-initiation thing?

332
00:25:47,855 --> 00:25:50,768
No. A-A man at the house down
the street, he tried to rape me.

333
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:52,683
That's bonkers.

334
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:55,352
We have to call 911.
I-I dropped my phone.

335
00:25:55,405 --> 00:25:57,146
First thing,
we stop the bleeding.

336
00:25:57,198 --> 00:26:00,032
My mom will kill me
if I get blood on anything.

337
00:26:00,076 --> 00:26:01,237
I'm babysitting.

338
00:26:01,285 --> 00:26:02,867
Oh, what does that pay?

339
00:26:02,912 --> 00:26:04,119
Twenty-five an hour.

340
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:06,530
- Wow.
- I see your boobs.

341
00:26:06,582 --> 00:26:09,290
Hey!
Back in the TV room, guys.

342
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:11,167
This is adults only.

343
00:26:11,212 --> 00:26:12,919
Sorry.

344
00:26:12,964 --> 00:26:15,297
Come oh.
Go, go, go.

345
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:31,062
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

346
00:26:31,107 --> 00:26:34,271
I'm having a heck of a time
getting these two situated.

347
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:36,318
Here.

348
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:37,398
You're alone?

349
00:26:39,073 --> 00:26:40,689
Just me and the monsters.

350
00:26:40,742 --> 00:26:43,325
That's why your story
is so scary.

351
00:26:46,622 --> 00:26:49,365
I don't think any of this
is mine.

352
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:52,376
You sure?
Your face is really pale.

353
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:56,126
Um, what did the police say?

354
00:26:56,174 --> 00:26:59,417
Oh, I knew I was forgetting
something.

355
00:26:59,469 --> 00:27:01,882
Here.
You need the sugar.

356
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:04,467
It'll keep you from going
into shock.

357
00:27:36,172 --> 00:27:37,208
Hey!

358
00:27:41,177 --> 00:27:43,544
You tell,
I'll say you touched my butt.

359
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:56,981
Wait. Are you allowed
to be watching this?

360
00:27:57,026 --> 00:27:59,734
Hey. Hey!

361
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,987
Stay off the carpet, okay?

362
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:05,319
You must be freezing.

363
00:28:05,993 --> 00:28:07,404
Police?

364
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:09,490
They said they're sending
someone right away.

365
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:10,746
We're supposed to sit tight.

366
00:28:16,587 --> 00:28:17,998
He's dead!

367
00:28:18,047 --> 00:28:20,630
Oh, he's just sleepy, sweetie.

368
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:25,794
You gave a child soda?!

369
00:28:25,847 --> 00:28:28,339
- What is wrong with you?
- What did you put in that?

370
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:31,763
Shh.
I'm sorry I snapped.

371
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:33,552
Jordan's diabetic,

372
00:28:33,604 --> 00:28:35,891
and refined sugar really throws
his system out of balance.

373
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,397
I don't want to hurt you.

374
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:40,229
Of course not.
Why would you want to hurt me?

375
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:42,110
- Don't move.
- I'm not moving.

376
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,941
Get her, sweetie!

377
00:28:51,247 --> 00:28:52,488
Get that mean lady!

378
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,871
I'm sorry!

379
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,787
You motherfucker!
That is a child!

380
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,331
You'd better pray
he doesn't have a concussion!

381
00:29:02,383 --> 00:29:03,794
Just leave me alone.

382
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:06,631
All you had to do
was drink your Coca-Cola,

383
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:09,547
but now you've created
a situation!

384
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:12,012
- Stay away!
- I know girls like you.

385
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:15,348
You go to public school
and eat government cheese

386
00:29:15,396 --> 00:29:18,514
and get pregnant
in the sixth grade!

387
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:23,481
Hey, babe.
What's all the racket?

388
00:29:25,656 --> 00:29:27,192
Shred her, sis.

389
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:29,741
Who are you people?!

390
00:29:40,087 --> 00:29:41,294
Slut.

391
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:45,252
Hey!

392
00:29:54,268 --> 00:29:55,429
No. No.
No.

393
00:29:55,478 --> 00:29:57,686
No. No, no.
No, no.

394
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,847
No. No. No.
No.

395
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:02,061
No, no.
No.

396
00:30:56,872 --> 00:30:58,864
Hello?

397
00:31:13,097 --> 00:31:15,760
That's a Kmart bra, so I'm
assuming you're not one of them.

398
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:18,596
Um, I-I'm Sam.
I deliver pizza.

399
00:31:18,644 --> 00:31:21,011
What the fuck
are you waiting for? Untie me.

400
00:31:21,063 --> 00:31:22,599
I'm having some trust issues
right now.

401
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:24,935
The enemy of your enemy
is your friend.

402
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:26,725
- What?
- The enemy of your en...

403
00:31:26,777 --> 00:31:28,817
For fuck's sake, they were
about to bang me to death

404
00:31:28,863 --> 00:31:30,775
with a giant killdo, okay?

405
00:31:30,823 --> 00:31:31,939
Okay.

406
00:31:34,368 --> 00:31:35,734
Now, wait.
Who are you?

407
00:31:35,786 --> 00:31:37,386
None of your fucking business,
paper boy.

408
00:31:37,413 --> 00:31:38,699
Pizza girl.

409
00:31:38,748 --> 00:31:40,364
I don't give a flying monkey's
fuck sac.

410
00:31:40,416 --> 00:31:42,123
Ow!

411
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,252
Look, we have to get out
of here.

412
00:31:46,297 --> 00:31:47,833
What's this "we" shit?

413
00:31:47,882 --> 00:31:49,965
I'm getting out of here.
You can go back to Domino's.

414
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:51,796
- I don't know what's happening!
- Yeah.

415
00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:54,461
That's exactly why I want you
to stay the fuck away from me.

416
00:31:58,142 --> 00:31:59,883
<i>911. What's your emergency?

417
00:31:59,935 --> 00:32:01,301
Hi. Yeah.
I'm at Mill Basin.

418
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:02,956
And I don't know
what's happening, but I'm...

419
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,471
<i>What's your location, please?

420
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:06,310
Um, I-I don't know the address,

421
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:08,816
but it's... it's a big house,
scary-looking.

422
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:10,773
Um, it's, like,
on a deserted street.

423
00:32:10,821 --> 00:32:11,937
I don't...

424
00:32:11,989 --> 00:32:13,605
Idiot.

425
00:32:15,785 --> 00:32:18,448
They're at Kim
and Steve's house.

426
00:32:18,496 --> 00:32:21,159
You have the survival instincts
of a giant panda bear.

427
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:22,994
Stay the fuck away from...

428
00:32:25,252 --> 00:32:26,538
Did you do that?

429
00:32:26,587 --> 00:32:28,749
It was an accident.

430
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,257
You're a natural born killer.

431
00:32:32,301 --> 00:32:33,382
Judi.

432
00:32:33,427 --> 00:32:35,293
No.
I-I didn't mean to.

433
00:32:35,346 --> 00:32:38,589
Get your big tits in gear.
They know we're here.

434
00:32:50,778 --> 00:32:52,019
Oh.
Wait, wait.

435
00:32:54,323 --> 00:32:55,404
This way.

436
00:33:25,688 --> 00:33:27,645
Why do I smell your daughter?

437
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,147
That's her corpse
you're smelling.

438
00:33:29,191 --> 00:33:30,523
Kim and Steven took care of her.

439
00:33:30,568 --> 00:33:31,934
Okay.

440
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:42,657
Your whore daughter murdered
our girls, Danica.

441
00:33:42,705 --> 00:33:44,162
What?

442
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:45,976
Why were Kristen and Michelle
with my daughter?

443
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,536
Oh. We, uh...

444
00:33:47,585 --> 00:33:51,625
Did you kill my daughter
like I asked you to, Steven?

445
00:33:51,672 --> 00:33:53,379
We gave her to the girls,
Danica.

446
00:33:53,424 --> 00:33:54,585
You what?!

447
00:33:55,593 --> 00:33:57,300
They were so excited
about killing her.

448
00:33:57,344 --> 00:33:58,835
I know.

449
00:33:58,888 --> 00:34:00,299
Oh!

450
00:34:00,347 --> 00:34:02,885
- They wanted to, sweetie.
- Why did I do that?

451
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:07,059
I am seriously questioning
your leadership.

452
00:34:07,104 --> 00:34:08,515
All right, people!

453
00:34:08,564 --> 00:34:10,931
We will form three-person
kill teams.

454
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:12,815
We will split the neighborhood
into quadrants.

455
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,101
Go, go, go!

456
00:34:14,153 --> 00:34:15,985
Don't be a fascist, Gypsy.

457
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,300
We didn't sell our souls so
we could clomp around outdoors

458
00:34:18,324 --> 00:34:20,031
like a bunch of goddamn hippies.

459
00:34:20,075 --> 00:34:21,862
Fascists get things done.

460
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:29,499
Thank you, Danielle.

461
00:34:46,727 --> 00:34:48,184
Trivets.

462
00:34:51,315 --> 00:34:53,807
Soul soufflé, anyone?

463
00:34:54,777 --> 00:34:55,777
Knife.

464
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:07,593
T-shirt.

465
00:36:18,902 --> 00:36:21,110
Samuel, find me my virgin.

466
00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:37,957
And that's why I lead
this coven.

467
00:36:38,547 --> 00:36:40,129
Burn this.

468
00:37:01,028 --> 00:37:03,111
Let's sneak back to my Vespa
and go.

469
00:37:05,407 --> 00:37:08,741
A, I'm not getting caught dead
on a fucking Vespa,

470
00:37:08,786 --> 00:37:10,994
and B, they're about to have
sick, fucked-up shit

471
00:37:11,038 --> 00:37:13,155
all over these streets
in about five seconds.

472
00:37:24,093 --> 00:37:25,334
All right.

473
00:37:25,386 --> 00:37:27,173
This should keep out
the basics...

474
00:37:27,221 --> 00:37:30,635
spirit dogs, slipskins,
grind guts,

475
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:35,723
the gray man, night hags...
anything that walks or crawls.

476
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:39,931
Demons won't cross salt
without counting every grain.

477
00:37:39,983 --> 00:37:41,394
It's one of their rules.

478
00:37:41,443 --> 00:37:44,151
Fuckers have more rules
than Yahtzee.

479
00:37:45,072 --> 00:37:46,841
Demons are obsessed with laws,
codes, rituals...

480
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,481
all that type-A shit.

481
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:50,303
What are you talking about?
Those were just people.

482
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,202
Oh, was that just people
back there...

483
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:55,433
a girl I've known my entire life
about to hump me to death

484
00:37:55,457 --> 00:37:57,073
with her H.R. Giger love stick?

485
00:37:57,126 --> 00:37:59,118
Okay. They're nuts,
but they're not wizards.

486
00:37:59,169 --> 00:38:00,535
We have to go.

487
00:38:00,587 --> 00:38:03,250
Whoever lives here
is gonna come home.

488
00:38:03,298 --> 00:38:06,382
No one's gonna be home
before sun-up.

489
00:38:12,516 --> 00:38:14,285
Let's just call the police
or... or get out of here,

490
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:15,345
but we can't stay here.

491
00:38:18,105 --> 00:38:20,222
Oh, my God.

492
00:38:20,274 --> 00:38:21,981
You're like a big retarded baby.

493
00:38:22,025 --> 00:38:24,438
My mom and her butt buddies
are booty-calling Baphomet,

494
00:38:24,486 --> 00:38:26,648
and we're gonna hide in here
like scared little bitches

495
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:29,110
because they can turn your liver
into fire ants.

496
00:38:29,158 --> 00:38:32,071
If they find us,
they're not going to kill us.

497
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:34,236
They're gonna do shit
that you can't comprehend.

498
00:38:34,288 --> 00:38:35,870
And they're not going to stop

499
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:37,684
until you're strapped naked
to a barbed-wire altar

500
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:39,995
with the 15-foot
beast of Gehenna

501
00:38:40,043 --> 00:38:41,500
and his double-pronged
demon dong

502
00:38:41,545 --> 00:38:42,956
walking out of your cooch chute

503
00:38:43,005 --> 00:38:45,588
like it's a revolving door
of ground beef.

504
00:38:46,842 --> 00:38:49,175
Why am I even listening to you?
You're one of them.

505
00:38:50,179 --> 00:38:52,717
That's the first smart thing
you've said today.

506
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:54,756
Look, I'm going upstairs
and I'm getting a shirt,

507
00:38:54,808 --> 00:38:56,140
and then I'm getting out
of here.

508
00:38:56,185 --> 00:38:57,926
Stay or go.
It's your choice.

509
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,638
That's cute.
You think we have choices.

510
00:41:26,752 --> 00:41:27,833
No!

511
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:50,355
Sam!

512
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:52,062
I got you.
I got you.

513
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:55,398
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

514
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:58,481
Come on. You're gonna be okay.
I got you.

515
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:26,346
Help me!

516
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,772
Was I just attacked by a sheet?

517
00:42:41,243 --> 00:42:42,243
Yes.

518
00:42:42,285 --> 00:42:45,778
Well, technically a haxan cloak.

519
00:42:56,717 --> 00:42:58,549
It's gone!

520
00:42:59,344 --> 00:43:01,711
Your haxan cloak failed.

521
00:43:02,556 --> 00:43:05,048
This wouldn't be the first time
you were wrong.

522
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,513
I know you have
some of Judi's hair.

523
00:43:07,561 --> 00:43:08,927
Give it to me.

524
00:43:08,979 --> 00:43:11,813
We want to find the girls,
not kill them.

525
00:43:12,566 --> 00:43:15,183
Your daughter lost
her virginity,

526
00:43:15,235 --> 00:43:19,195
your husband lost our virgin,
and your haxan cloak failed.

527
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:21,481
Someone needs to take charge.

528
00:43:21,533 --> 00:43:23,741
And you're volunteering?

529
00:43:23,785 --> 00:43:25,651
It is five hours until sunrise.

530
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:28,071
We don't have time
for a weak leader.

531
00:43:28,123 --> 00:43:31,958
Now give me her hair
and get out of my way.

532
00:43:32,919 --> 00:43:35,081
Is this how everyone feels?

533
00:43:37,632 --> 00:43:40,625
Our... Our children are dead,
Danica.

534
00:43:40,677 --> 00:43:42,134
Danielle?

535
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,593
I see.
Then I'll prepare the altar.

536
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:51,639
We'll do it.

537
00:43:51,688 --> 00:43:53,850
This rookie needs a clean slate.

538
00:43:53,899 --> 00:43:56,141
Oh. Here.

539
00:43:56,193 --> 00:43:58,560
The tramp dropped this.
She got a call.

540
00:43:58,612 --> 00:44:00,820
Wasn't dropping
a veil of shadows

541
00:44:00,864 --> 00:44:03,106
over our activities <i>your</i> job?

542
00:44:03,158 --> 00:44:08,620
Make the witness disappear
if you think you can handle it.

543
00:44:09,664 --> 00:44:11,451
Mind the carpet.

544
00:44:20,008 --> 00:44:26,551
Home-schooled, black Amex,
new Saab... all when I was 15.

545
00:44:26,598 --> 00:44:28,180
I was the shit.

546
00:44:28,225 --> 00:44:30,638
And then tonight, they summon
Baphomet's big hairy ass

547
00:44:30,685 --> 00:44:32,096
and let him do
all this sick shit

548
00:44:32,145 --> 00:44:33,915
and he makes them super rulers
of the universe.

549
00:44:33,939 --> 00:44:35,521
And you?

550
00:44:35,565 --> 00:44:37,645
Apparently, Baphomet only
travels through virgin vag.

551
00:44:38,151 --> 00:44:39,608
Doesn't end well for the virgin.

552
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:44,355
Wait.
You're a virgin?

553
00:44:45,242 --> 00:44:47,859
President of
the Promise Keepers.

554
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:50,028
As soon as I found out
why they wanted my cherry,

555
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,571
I didn't even want to.

556
00:44:51,623 --> 00:44:54,036
Found the first guy I could
and boned down.

557
00:44:54,084 --> 00:44:56,371
We should stop drinking.

558
00:44:56,419 --> 00:44:59,958
You really want to face
this shit sober?

559
00:45:00,006 --> 00:45:01,838
I've seen three people die
tonight

560
00:45:01,883 --> 00:45:05,172
and was just attacked
by some really expensive sheets.

561
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,839
So I don't really know
what to think right now.

562
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:11,678
Welcome to the world
behind the world.

563
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,033
As above, so below.

564
00:45:46,344 --> 00:45:48,757
- Hi, is this Sam's friend?
- This is Duncan.

565
00:45:48,805 --> 00:45:51,263
Oh, this is Duncan.

566
00:45:51,308 --> 00:45:53,516
Oh, she would not stop talking
about you.

567
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,721
That doesn't surprise me.

568
00:45:54,769 --> 00:45:56,180
Well, I met Sam on Tinder,

569
00:45:56,229 --> 00:45:58,346
but she turned out to be
a real disappointment.

570
00:45:58,398 --> 00:46:01,891
All she did was cry and talk
about you, so I threw her out.

571
00:46:01,943 --> 00:46:03,559
Then I saw she left her phone,

572
00:46:03,612 --> 00:46:06,571
and, well, I thought I'd go
straight to the source.

573
00:46:06,615 --> 00:46:08,857
I'm a bit of a size queen,
to be honest with you.

574
00:46:08,909 --> 00:46:10,616
You are?
Well, it's uncut.

575
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:14,529
Oh.
That's very impressive.

576
00:46:14,581 --> 00:46:19,701
Well, I have an eight ball of
cocaine and feel empty inside.

577
00:46:19,753 --> 00:46:21,870
Why don't you come over
and fill me up?

578
00:46:21,922 --> 00:46:23,333
Need me
to stop and grab anything?

579
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:24,838
Scented oils?

580
00:46:24,883 --> 00:46:28,797
The... The kind that warm...
warm things up?

581
00:46:28,845 --> 00:46:30,211
Trust me...

582
00:46:31,473 --> 00:46:33,715
I'm only interested
in your body.

583
00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:16,011
Death to the weak.

584
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:17,925
Wealth to the strong.

585
00:47:19,396 --> 00:47:23,481
Death to the weak.
Wealth to the strong.

586
00:47:23,525 --> 00:47:26,814
Death to the weak.

587
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:48,040
Um, I-I have to
tell you something.

588
00:47:48,091 --> 00:47:50,378
You have feelings for me?

589
00:47:50,427 --> 00:47:52,293
Have another drink.
They'll pass.

590
00:47:52,345 --> 00:47:53,802
No.

591
00:47:55,390 --> 00:47:56,801
I'm a virgin.

592
00:47:58,435 --> 00:47:59,435
What?

593
00:48:00,937 --> 00:48:02,473
How the fuck
is that possible?

594
00:48:02,522 --> 00:48:04,639
I had a boyfriend,
but he just couldn't perform.

595
00:48:04,691 --> 00:48:06,557
- I mean, he's gone now, but...
- We're fucked.

596
00:48:06,609 --> 00:48:08,942
I mean, I-I don't... I don't
mind if we have to...

597
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:10,444
Uh, yeah,
I-I see what you're doing.

598
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:12,104
No, I know
what you're thinking,

599
00:48:12,157 --> 00:48:14,240
but even if I stuck
a fucking candle up your cooch,

600
00:48:14,284 --> 00:48:16,446
it's strictly dickly
when it comes to black magic.

601
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:18,486
- I'm sorry.
- Your boyfriend's limp dick

602
00:48:18,538 --> 00:48:19,619
is gonna get us killed.

603
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:20,664
As soon as... Hey.

604
00:48:22,459 --> 00:48:23,950
You're bleeding.

605
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,250
Oh, no.

606
00:48:29,299 --> 00:48:31,165
- Oh, no, no.
- What?

607
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:34,468
They have my hair.

608
00:48:34,512 --> 00:48:37,050
Wealth to the strong.

609
00:48:37,098 --> 00:48:39,306
Death to the weak.

610
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:40,886
Wealth to the strong.

611
00:48:50,737 --> 00:48:53,445
Sam, hurry.

612
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:55,322
We have to seal my skin.

613
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:57,699
It's the only way.

614
00:48:57,744 --> 00:49:00,282
Write this.
Start on my feet.

615
00:49:13,426 --> 00:49:14,462
Fuck.

616
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:19,056
Okay.

617
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:22,559
Fuck!

618
00:49:22,602 --> 00:49:24,264
Death to the weak.

619
00:49:24,312 --> 00:49:26,178
Wealth to the strong.

620
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:29,272
I'm drawing it.

621
00:49:29,317 --> 00:49:31,730
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

622
00:49:31,778 --> 00:49:33,690
Wealth to the strong.

623
00:49:33,738 --> 00:49:35,229
Death to the weak.

624
00:49:35,281 --> 00:49:37,694
Wealth to the strong.

625
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:39,779
- Hurry, hurry.
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

626
00:49:50,505 --> 00:49:52,918
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God. What is happening?

627
00:49:52,966 --> 00:49:54,878
Wealth to the strong.

628
00:50:13,194 --> 00:50:14,810
Keep going.

629
00:50:14,863 --> 00:50:17,606
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, I ca... I can't do this.

630
00:50:17,657 --> 00:50:19,193
I just...
I just want to go home.

631
00:50:19,242 --> 00:50:24,112
I was supposed to be
a gore streak on a mattress.

632
00:50:24,164 --> 00:50:26,451
And you beat them.

633
00:50:28,543 --> 00:50:29,543
Write.

634
00:50:29,586 --> 00:50:31,122
I can't, I can't.

635
00:50:31,171 --> 00:50:32,753
Tell me a story.

636
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:34,959
Once upon a time, there was
a boy named Harry Potter.

637
00:50:35,008 --> 00:50:38,001
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- I don't know what to say!

638
00:50:40,263 --> 00:50:42,755
I never had a boyfriend.

639
00:50:42,807 --> 00:50:44,014
Tell me about yours.

640
00:50:45,393 --> 00:50:47,726
What, about Daniel?

641
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:51,980
Um... Um, he could do the entire
"Road Warrior" movie,

642
00:50:52,025 --> 00:50:53,891
including sound effects,
from memory.

643
00:50:53,943 --> 00:50:57,653
Um, I met him
at my first day at AYAO.

644
00:50:57,697 --> 00:51:01,441
Uh, AYAO... the Adolescent
Young Adult Oncology Center.

645
00:51:01,492 --> 00:51:04,610
I had to stay there
for my chemo.

646
00:51:04,662 --> 00:51:06,244
I'll never love anyone else.

647
00:51:09,209 --> 00:51:11,121
Death to the weak.

648
00:51:11,169 --> 00:51:13,252
Wealth to the strong.

649
00:51:13,296 --> 00:51:16,539
Death to the weak.
Wealth to the strong.

650
00:51:18,134 --> 00:51:20,467
We were in and out of AYAO
for two years,

651
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:23,128
and he taught me a mantra
for when I get tense.

652
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:25,218
Um, it's... it's silly
and it's goofy,

653
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:26,802
but I just focus on
two fuzzy bunnies

654
00:51:26,851 --> 00:51:28,537
until they're the only thing
in the entire world,

655
00:51:28,561 --> 00:51:30,247
and it just
totally blocks out all the pain.

656
00:51:30,271 --> 00:51:31,271
Aah!

657
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:34,894
Finish my back!

658
00:51:34,943 --> 00:51:36,855
- Finish my back!
- Um! Um...

659
00:51:36,903 --> 00:51:38,860
I had Hodgkin's lymphoma,
and he had leukemia.

660
00:51:38,905 --> 00:51:40,567
Don't stop!

661
00:51:40,615 --> 00:51:42,732
I had to stay at the hospital
for my chemo infusions,

662
00:51:42,784 --> 00:51:44,776
so after each one
he'd roll his chair to my door

663
00:51:44,827 --> 00:51:46,910
and do the "Road Warrior"
to make me laugh.

664
00:51:46,955 --> 00:51:48,196
He told me that Australia

665
00:51:48,248 --> 00:51:49,308
was the greatest country
in the world.

666
00:51:49,332 --> 00:51:50,743
Um, I wrote him songs

667
00:51:53,253 --> 00:51:54,869
and the first time we kissed

668
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:57,379
was after I sang to him
about the rainbow lorikeets.

669
00:52:00,927 --> 00:52:02,919
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Don't... Don't stop.

670
00:52:02,971 --> 00:52:04,837
- Don't stop.
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.

671
00:52:07,392 --> 00:52:09,884
<i>Wealth to the strong.

672
00:52:09,936 --> 00:52:11,472
<i>Death to the weak.

673
00:52:11,521 --> 00:52:13,888
<i>Wealth to the strong.

674
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,680
We were gonna celebrate
our first cancerversary

675
00:52:27,704 --> 00:52:29,320
by going to Australia together.

676
00:52:29,372 --> 00:52:33,161
But, um, after I went
into remission, Daniel didn't.

677
00:52:33,209 --> 00:52:36,202
Two weeks after they told me
I was cancer-free,

678
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:38,496
he went back into AYAO.

679
00:52:38,548 --> 00:52:43,339
I wanted to visit him,
but I couldn't.

680
00:52:43,386 --> 00:52:45,503
I mean, no one blamed me.
Everyone understood.

681
00:52:45,555 --> 00:52:49,174
But the fact is he never gave up
on me, and I gave up on him.

682
00:52:49,225 --> 00:52:50,932
I ran away.

683
00:52:50,977 --> 00:52:51,977
Judi?

684
00:52:52,937 --> 00:52:54,553
Don't stop.

685
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:58,645
<i>Death to the weak.
Wealth to the strong.

686
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:04,696
No! Come on!

687
00:53:04,741 --> 00:53:07,233
Come on, come on, come on.

688
00:53:07,285 --> 00:53:08,867
<i>Death to the weak.

689
00:53:08,911 --> 00:53:11,153
- Come on, come on.
<i>- Wealth to the strong.

690
00:53:13,708 --> 00:53:16,451
Come on.

691
00:53:32,852 --> 00:53:34,718
That Viking whore!

692
00:53:34,771 --> 00:53:37,434
She taught her daughter
the book.

693
00:53:37,482 --> 00:53:38,643
Fuck!

694
00:53:43,529 --> 00:53:46,021
The party has arrived,
motherfuckers.

695
00:53:46,074 --> 00:53:47,815
Enter freely.

696
00:54:00,296 --> 00:54:02,959
You got lady balls.

697
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:06,296
People like you normally look
at someone like me and think,

698
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:09,633
"This guy is living
in a frequency.

699
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,262
I can't handle."

700
00:54:11,307 --> 00:54:17,474
Grade-A melting-snowflake,
skin-shivering cocaine.

701
00:54:17,522 --> 00:54:22,187
Like an icy waterfall
inside your brain.

702
00:54:22,235 --> 00:54:23,942
Uh...

703
00:54:24,946 --> 00:54:25,982
Yeah.

704
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:27,146
Oh!

705
00:54:28,991 --> 00:54:31,074
Uh, do you have a beer?

706
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,328
IPA? Light beer is fine.
I just...

707
00:54:34,372 --> 00:54:36,284
I have to drive.

708
00:54:36,332 --> 00:54:37,368
Later.

709
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:38,908
Quitter.

710
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,826
Relax.
Snort.

711
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:41,795
Okay.

712
00:54:47,552 --> 00:54:49,009
- Oh, more?
- Mm-hmm.

713
00:54:49,053 --> 00:54:50,840
Okay.

714
00:54:54,809 --> 00:54:56,516
- Now, tell me...
- Hmm?

715
00:54:56,561 --> 00:54:57,768
How do you feel?

716
00:54:57,812 --> 00:55:00,099
How do I feel?
Um...

717
00:55:01,023 --> 00:55:03,640
How do... How do I feel?
Uh...

718
00:55:05,862 --> 00:55:07,478
I feel amazing.

719
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,361
Ow.

720
00:55:21,043 --> 00:55:23,535
Come back.
What are you doing?

721
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:29,124
What's...

722
00:55:29,177 --> 00:55:30,588
What's wrong with my legs?

723
00:55:36,309 --> 00:55:38,722
What are you...
What are you...?

724
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:40,135
What'd you do to my legs?

725
00:55:43,232 --> 00:55:45,144
What'd you do to me?

726
00:55:53,242 --> 00:55:55,484
Uh-huh.

727
00:55:55,536 --> 00:55:56,697
Yep.

728
00:55:56,746 --> 00:55:58,988
There we go.
Uh-huh.

729
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,158
You're going to help me
find my daughter.

730
00:56:05,421 --> 00:56:08,289
Mm-hmm.
Where are the girls, huh?

731
00:56:10,134 --> 00:56:12,626
G-Girls...

732
00:56:14,013 --> 00:56:18,007
You're going to tell me
exactly what I need to know.

733
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:19,828
I can't... I can't hear you.

734
00:56:19,852 --> 00:56:21,468
What's that?

735
00:56:21,521 --> 00:56:24,480
Oh, now we're talking.

736
00:56:24,524 --> 00:56:25,524
All right.

737
00:56:25,566 --> 00:56:28,559
Where are they?

738
00:56:28,611 --> 00:56:30,898
Where are these girls, huh?

739
00:56:34,784 --> 00:56:36,400
Okay.

740
00:56:38,371 --> 00:56:40,738
Fucking unbelievable, Mom.

741
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:42,184
When they were focused
on killing me,

742
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:43,808
you could've
gotten the fuck out of here.

743
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:46,497
That's what <i>I</i> would've done.

744
00:56:46,546 --> 00:56:48,333
I don't
leave my friends behind anymore.

745
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:52,212
Yeah, I guess
we are friends, huh?

746
00:56:58,266 --> 00:57:00,508
I-I mean, do you know any magic
that can protect us?

747
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,598
I know they've got one
around here somewhere.

748
00:57:08,067 --> 00:57:09,649
Gotcha.

749
00:57:09,694 --> 00:57:11,936
That's not gonna stop them.
They're stronger than us.

750
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:15,026
- So, what happened?
- What?

751
00:57:15,074 --> 00:57:17,031
Your story.

752
00:57:17,076 --> 00:57:18,863
You holed up in your house.
Then what?

753
00:57:18,911 --> 00:57:19,911
Now?

754
00:57:21,038 --> 00:57:24,702
Um, now I'm trying.

755
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:27,663
You know, I-I've been busking,
and I went and got a job,

756
00:57:27,712 --> 00:57:31,376
and tonight
was my first night.

757
00:57:31,424 --> 00:57:35,259
This was supposed to be my big
day to turn everything around.

758
00:57:42,184 --> 00:57:46,519
You're right, Sam.
They are stronger than us.

759
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:49,557
They're ruthless, selfish,

760
00:57:49,609 --> 00:57:52,818
and they'll slit each other's
throats to kiss satanic ass.

761
00:57:52,862 --> 00:57:54,478
But you know what we are?

762
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:56,112
What?

763
00:57:56,157 --> 00:57:59,070
You're a blue-collar badass
that just won't quit,

764
00:57:59,118 --> 00:58:01,952
and I'm a spoiled brat
with a gun.

765
00:58:01,996 --> 00:58:03,703
They don't stand a chance.

766
00:58:29,231 --> 00:58:30,642
I can't believe it.

767
00:58:30,691 --> 00:58:32,774
Huh!

768
00:58:34,153 --> 00:58:37,772
Now, this is what's known
as situational irony.

769
00:58:42,453 --> 00:58:45,116
Oh. Spell didn't work?
Well...

770
00:58:45,164 --> 00:58:46,951
You taught your daughter
the book!

771
00:58:46,999 --> 00:58:48,365
She knows how to skin seal.

772
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:50,124
You were
never gonna give her up!

773
00:58:50,169 --> 00:58:51,205
I found them.

774
00:58:51,253 --> 00:58:52,460
- They're at...
- Wait!

775
00:59:02,223 --> 00:59:03,680
Damn it, Kim.

776
00:59:03,724 --> 00:59:06,216
- What?
- Yeah, we talked about this.

777
00:59:09,897 --> 00:59:10,897
You know what to do?

778
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:12,727
Yes.

779
00:59:12,775 --> 00:59:14,107
You scared?

780
00:59:16,529 --> 00:59:17,690
Me too.

781
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:39,795
Can you read those, honey?

782
00:59:39,844 --> 00:59:41,176
No.

783
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:44,634
No, I can't, Gary, okay?

784
00:59:44,682 --> 00:59:46,218
I can't read his guts.

785
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:49,267
That was Danica's department.

786
00:59:49,311 --> 00:59:50,472
We only have two hours.

787
00:59:50,521 --> 00:59:54,390
I know that, Gary!

788
00:59:54,442 --> 00:59:56,399
I can tell time.

789
00:59:56,444 --> 00:59:58,811
The worst part...
the worst part, Gary...

790
00:59:58,863 --> 00:59:59,863
I saw this coming.

791
00:59:59,905 --> 01:00:01,146
I saw this years ago.

792
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:04,111
Answer your fucking phone!

793
01:00:06,871 --> 01:00:08,078
Airplane mode?

794
01:00:08,122 --> 01:00:10,990
What the shit?

795
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,122
Oh.

796
01:00:13,586 --> 01:00:15,168
God!

797
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:21,925
Hello?

798
01:00:21,969 --> 01:00:23,255
<i>Gypsy.

799
01:00:25,014 --> 01:00:26,014
Judi.

800
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:27,342
You want to lead the coven?

801
01:00:27,391 --> 01:00:30,054
Why would you help me?

802
01:00:30,102 --> 01:00:31,809
Because my whore mother
tried to kill me.

803
01:00:31,854 --> 01:00:33,971
No, no, no.
Not good enough.

804
01:00:34,023 --> 01:00:35,730
<i>You have my hair,

805
01:00:35,775 --> 01:00:38,563
and I don't want to spend
the rest of my life on the run.

806
01:00:38,611 --> 01:00:41,024
I want back in.

807
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:42,357
I have the virgin.

808
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:45,490
Where are you?

809
01:00:45,534 --> 01:00:47,400
Check your caller I.D.

810
01:00:55,127 --> 01:00:56,368
You little bitch!

811
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:58,082
Okay.

812
01:00:58,130 --> 01:00:59,837
The virgin is at my house.

813
01:00:59,882 --> 01:01:02,716
We have two hours, people.

814
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:06,299
Does anyone here
contest my right to lead?

815
01:01:07,515 --> 01:01:10,758
Let's show some hustle,
people!

816
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:12,267
Let's go!

817
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:04,254
Where is she?
I know she's in here.

818
01:03:04,298 --> 01:03:06,631
Where is she?
It's happening, Gary.

819
01:03:08,469 --> 01:03:10,071
This is the moment.
This is happening, Gary.

820
01:03:10,095 --> 01:03:11,302
Okay.

821
01:03:11,347 --> 01:03:12,181
No, no, wait!

822
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:19,852
Damn it, Kyle.

823
01:03:19,897 --> 01:03:23,015
Baphomet,

824
01:03:23,067 --> 01:03:25,275
king of the witches,

825
01:03:25,319 --> 01:03:28,403
lord of the Knights of Templar,

826
01:03:28,447 --> 01:03:32,191
triple-face fuck monster
of remorseless intent

827
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:36,156
and illuminator
of poisonous knowledge,

828
01:03:36,205 --> 01:03:39,869
give me strength
in my hour of need.

829
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:41,874
<i>Help me find them, Baphomet.

830
01:03:41,919 --> 01:03:43,501
<i>This one thing I ask.

831
01:03:53,847 --> 01:03:55,964
Judi?

832
01:03:56,016 --> 01:03:57,016
Judi?!

833
01:04:04,233 --> 01:04:06,646
Judi?
Judi!

834
01:04:06,694 --> 01:04:08,694
<i>Judi!
Judi! Judi! Judi! Judi!

835
01:04:26,463 --> 01:04:27,670
Judi!

836
01:04:35,264 --> 01:04:37,802
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

837
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:40,934
We're in the Vale of Shadows.
It's all fucked up.

838
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:42,344
We got to go.

839
01:04:54,616 --> 01:04:56,278
I knew no daughter of mine

840
01:04:56,326 --> 01:04:59,160
would give Gypsy Neumieir
the time of day.

841
01:04:59,204 --> 01:05:00,820
Well done, sweetie.

842
01:05:03,709 --> 01:05:05,325
Fuck you.

843
01:05:05,377 --> 01:05:07,960
That's no way
to talk to your mother.

844
01:05:08,005 --> 01:05:10,668
It's time to go home.

845
01:05:10,716 --> 01:05:11,797
Bring your friend.

846
01:05:13,052 --> 01:05:14,463
You tried to kill me!

847
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:16,298
- Details.
- Run, Sam.

848
01:05:16,346 --> 01:05:18,303
Oh, Samantha,
I'm afraid Judi

849
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:19,617
may have
given you the impression

850
01:05:19,641 --> 01:05:21,303
that there's some escape.

851
01:05:21,351 --> 01:05:23,343
No, my millennial moppet.

852
01:05:23,395 --> 01:05:26,138
- We're inevitable.
- Shut up, Mom.

853
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:28,682
Judi, don't make this personal.
I'm not happy about it either.

854
01:05:28,734 --> 01:05:30,851
You think I like running around
in silly robes

855
01:05:30,903 --> 01:05:32,644
murdering my children?

856
01:05:32,696 --> 01:05:36,531
But you got to either get in the
game or sit on the sidelines.

857
01:05:36,575 --> 01:05:38,237
You don't have to do this.

858
01:05:38,285 --> 01:05:40,493
There's no other way.

859
01:05:40,537 --> 01:05:43,996
Do you think killing me
is gonna change the world?

860
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:46,784
You pull that trigger and the
sun will still come up tomorrow,

861
01:05:46,835 --> 01:05:48,417
only you'll be just like her.

862
01:05:48,462 --> 01:05:52,081
Oh! Maybe she'll get you a job
at her pizza parlor.

863
01:05:54,176 --> 01:05:55,587
Go.

864
01:05:55,636 --> 01:05:57,798
Wouldn't you rather spend
a few years on your feet

865
01:05:57,846 --> 01:06:00,179
than a lifetime
on your knees?

866
01:06:00,224 --> 01:06:03,513
What life did you leave me?!

867
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,768
You die, then me.

868
01:06:05,813 --> 01:06:08,351
We don't get to choose
the world, sweetheart.

869
01:06:08,398 --> 01:06:10,606
- One...
- If you want anything good,

870
01:06:10,651 --> 01:06:12,438
- you have to take it.
- ...two...

871
01:06:12,486 --> 01:06:14,728
You're young,
so I'm trying to be patient.

872
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:17,193
- ...three.
- Forget something?

873
01:06:38,345 --> 01:06:40,257
Are you kidnapping
my daughter?

874
01:06:40,305 --> 01:06:42,046
She'll thank me later.
Come on.

875
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:45,092
What do you have to offer her
but plastic shower curtains

876
01:06:45,144 --> 01:06:47,727
and Walmart sweatpants?

877
01:06:47,771 --> 01:06:50,479
All I see are a bunch
of Martha Stewart wannabes

878
01:06:50,524 --> 01:06:53,312
who drink white wine
and smoke medical marijuana

879
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:54,976
and listen to '80s playlists.

880
01:06:55,028 --> 01:06:56,860
We run the world.

881
01:06:56,905 --> 01:06:58,396
You're assholes.

882
01:06:58,448 --> 01:07:00,690
That little membrane
between your legs

883
01:07:00,742 --> 01:07:04,201
is the only thing that gives
your sad little life any value.

884
01:07:04,246 --> 01:07:05,862
I'm not letting you touch us.

885
01:07:05,914 --> 01:07:08,452
I hate to admit it, but you're
starting to annoy me.

886
01:07:27,769 --> 01:07:29,431
Sam?

887
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,647
Sam.

888
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:41,273
Sam?
Sam.

889
01:07:44,203 --> 01:07:45,694
You were right.

890
01:07:47,206 --> 01:07:49,823
I really...
I really screwed up.

891
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:23,990
No gaps. We don't want
any uninvited guests.

892
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:33,125
Danielle.

893
01:08:37,464 --> 01:08:38,796
The past is the past.

894
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,254
What matters now
is the great working.

895
01:08:47,432 --> 01:08:48,548
This is yours.

896
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,600
Danica...

897
01:08:49,601 --> 01:08:50,601
I washed it.

898
01:08:50,644 --> 01:08:52,806
Uh...

899
01:08:52,854 --> 01:08:55,016
I only wanted what was best
for the group.

900
01:08:55,065 --> 01:08:58,900
Gypsy just wanted
what was best for Gypsy.

901
01:08:58,944 --> 01:09:00,560
Have the balls to own it.

902
01:09:00,612 --> 01:09:03,480
But it's okay.
I understand.

903
01:09:03,532 --> 01:09:06,696
I understand what it's like
to be under so much pressure.

904
01:09:06,743 --> 01:09:08,109
Yeah.

905
01:09:08,161 --> 01:09:10,118
Almost like you're at the bottom
of the sea.

906
01:09:10,163 --> 01:09:14,908
All that water
pressing you down, crushing you,

907
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,747
filling your lungs.

908
01:09:18,297 --> 01:09:22,291
And you can't breathe
and you can't move

909
01:09:22,342 --> 01:09:24,755
and you can't speak,

910
01:09:24,803 --> 01:09:28,171
and you panic and you struggle,

911
01:09:28,223 --> 01:09:29,430
but it's no use.

912
01:09:32,519 --> 01:09:36,980
Drowning is the worst feeling
in the world.

913
01:09:56,001 --> 01:09:58,835
Danica?
We're sorry what happened.

914
01:09:58,879 --> 01:10:01,166
You thought you were
backing a winner.

915
01:10:01,214 --> 01:10:02,705
I understand.

916
01:10:02,758 --> 01:10:05,125
Uh, Kim's sorry in particular

917
01:10:05,177 --> 01:10:08,386
for, you know, uh, putting a...
a spike through your skull.

918
01:10:12,059 --> 01:10:14,722
I'll squat in the dirt
and piss on your grave

919
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:16,056
before I forgive you.

920
01:10:16,104 --> 01:10:19,438
You picked your side.
Now live with it.

921
01:10:20,567 --> 01:10:21,899
Oh!

922
01:10:30,494 --> 01:10:31,655
Mom.

923
01:10:31,703 --> 01:10:33,820
Please let me go.
I'm sorry.

924
01:10:33,872 --> 01:10:36,410
- No, don't beg her.
- I'll do whatever you want.

925
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:37,458
I'm getting us home.

926
01:10:37,501 --> 01:10:38,912
In five minutes,

927
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,542
you are going to have

928
01:10:40,587 --> 01:10:42,453
your very first
sexual encounter,

929
01:10:42,506 --> 01:10:44,372
lose your virginity,
and give birth

930
01:10:44,424 --> 01:10:47,963
all at the same time,
courtesy of the great Baphomet.

931
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:49,752
Fear is appropriate.

932
01:10:49,805 --> 01:10:51,421
Don't listen.

933
01:10:51,473 --> 01:10:54,136
She's just a sad old lady
with fake lips and a bony ass.

934
01:10:56,144 --> 01:10:58,136
If I wasn't
in such a good mood,

935
01:10:58,188 --> 01:10:59,895
I'd cut out your tongue
for that.

936
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:06,854
This is where our lord
will be born tonight.

937
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:11,862
It's going to hurt.
I guarantee it.

938
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,947
Mom...

939
01:11:13,995 --> 01:11:16,362
I'll do whatever you want.
Please.

940
01:11:16,415 --> 01:11:19,123
Children, b-babies.
I-I'll bring you babies.

941
01:11:19,167 --> 01:11:20,829
- I'll... I'll be your breeder.
- Shh.

942
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:25,042
I gave you the greatest honor,
and you spat in my face.

943
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:28,379
Your generation
doesn't understand sacrifice.

944
01:11:30,095 --> 01:11:32,337
What's going to happen next

945
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:35,507
barely begins to express
my disappointment.

946
01:11:42,482 --> 01:11:45,850
Are you ready to break the
chains of conventional morality

947
01:11:45,902 --> 01:11:48,736
- that stifle our ambitions?
- Yes!

948
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:51,523
Are you ready to make
an investment in your future?

949
01:11:51,575 --> 01:11:53,032
Yes!

950
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:55,864
And whose power unlocks
our true potential?

951
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:57,153
Hail Satan!

952
01:11:57,205 --> 01:11:58,787
- Who?
- Hail Satan!

953
01:11:58,832 --> 01:12:00,448
I can't hear you.

954
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,743
Hail Satan! Hail Satan!
Hail Satan!

955
01:12:03,795 --> 01:12:05,787
And who do we welcome here
tonight?

956
01:12:05,839 --> 01:12:08,252
Who is his emissary
that we summon?

957
01:12:08,300 --> 01:12:10,667
Hail Baphomet,
lord of achievement!

958
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:13,257
Hail Baphomet,
master of slaves!

959
01:12:13,305 --> 01:12:15,763
Hail Baphomet,
god of success!

960
01:12:15,807 --> 01:12:18,220
Hail Baphomet,
bringer of wealth!

961
01:12:18,268 --> 01:12:21,011
Hail fourfold,
bringer of joy!

962
01:12:21,062 --> 01:12:24,351
Tonight, we set aside the ways
of the old world...

963
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:26,982
love, empathy, and compassion.

964
01:12:27,027 --> 01:12:28,984
Those are the old tools.

965
01:12:29,029 --> 01:12:32,067
Join me in the invocation.

966
01:12:50,217 --> 01:12:53,676
We invoke thee, Baphomet,
light bringer.

967
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:56,258
I am, I think, I will!

968
01:12:56,306 --> 01:12:59,014
I am the sanction,
I am the warrant.

969
01:13:01,645 --> 01:13:05,264
Death to the weak.
Wealth to the strong.

970
01:13:05,315 --> 01:13:07,853
Death to the weak!
Wealth to the strong!

971
01:13:07,901 --> 01:13:11,190
Please, please, help me!

972
01:13:11,238 --> 01:13:14,652
Wealth to the strong.
I am, I think, I will!

973
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:27,285
Death to the weak.
I am, I think, I will!

974
01:13:29,965 --> 01:13:32,207
- I am, I think, I will!
- Help me, please!

975
01:13:32,259 --> 01:13:35,252
Please, help!

976
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:41,261
Help, please!

977
01:13:43,395 --> 01:13:47,139
The holy one comes.
Hail Satan.

978
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:48,681
Please.

979
01:13:48,733 --> 01:13:50,645
Hail Baphomet.

980
01:13:50,694 --> 01:13:53,858
Hail Satan.

981
01:14:01,371 --> 01:14:05,581
No, help, help!
No!

982
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:13,839
No, no, no, no, no!
No! No, no, no!

983
01:14:13,883 --> 01:14:15,875
Help me, please!

984
01:14:17,387 --> 01:14:20,425
Death to the weak.
Wealth to the strong.

985
01:14:25,478 --> 01:14:26,969
Help!

986
01:14:27,022 --> 01:14:29,264
Ohhh!
Oh!

987
01:14:31,151 --> 01:14:33,609
Death to the weak.
Wealth to the strong.

988
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:38,197
Ohh!

989
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:41,734
You fucking bug-eyed,
fun-sized asshole!

990
01:14:41,786 --> 01:14:45,746
You turtleneck-wearing,
egghead cheap fuck!

991
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:50,376
All you had to do was tip,
you cheap bastard!

992
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:54,209
My God, who puts corn on pizza,
you disgusting fuck?!

993
01:14:54,257 --> 01:14:57,375
You no-tipping, cheap-ass,

994
01:14:57,427 --> 01:15:01,762
Baby Gap-shopping
turd on ice!

995
01:15:01,806 --> 01:15:03,422
Fuck!

996
01:15:03,475 --> 01:15:05,512
Protect its womb!

997
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:07,301
Get back!

998
01:15:07,354 --> 01:15:08,890
Don't hurt it.

999
01:15:08,938 --> 01:15:10,895
I will stab him right through
the fucking skull.

1000
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:12,806
You're making a huge mistake.

1001
01:15:12,859 --> 01:15:15,067
Get her chains off now.

1002
01:15:15,111 --> 01:15:16,522
Samantha.

1003
01:15:16,571 --> 01:15:19,234
Get her chains off now!

1004
01:15:19,282 --> 01:15:21,319
This is all your fault.

1005
01:15:24,537 --> 01:15:25,948
No!

1006
01:15:25,997 --> 01:15:27,408
Judi, no!

1007
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:31,454
Prepare her vile gate
for his birth.

1008
01:15:31,503 --> 01:15:35,122
No!
No! No! Fuck!

1009
01:15:35,173 --> 01:15:38,166
No!

1010
01:15:38,218 --> 01:15:40,255
Death to the weak.
Wealth to the strong.

1011
01:15:40,303 --> 01:15:42,795
I am, I think, I will.

1012
01:15:42,847 --> 01:15:45,965
Death to the weak.
Wealth to the strong.

1013
01:15:53,566 --> 01:15:55,774
Come, Baphomet!

1014
01:15:55,819 --> 01:15:58,027
Come to us,
your worthy servants,

1015
01:15:58,071 --> 01:16:01,735
and place us above all others
by virtue of our excellence.

1016
01:16:22,846 --> 01:16:23,846
<i>Sam!

1017
01:17:28,661 --> 01:17:30,323
Whee!

1018
01:17:30,371 --> 01:17:32,203
Sammy!

1019
01:17:36,169 --> 01:17:37,250
You shouldn't be here.

1020
01:17:37,295 --> 01:17:38,706
Isn't this funny?

1021
01:17:38,755 --> 01:17:40,587
Who are you?

1022
01:17:40,632 --> 01:17:43,875
My name's Samaziel.
I'm from hell.

1023
01:17:50,725 --> 01:17:52,717
Someone made an oopsie.

1024
01:17:54,646 --> 01:17:56,262
Wait, did you make
everyone disappear?

1025
01:17:56,314 --> 01:18:00,399
There are 11 princes in hell,
and I'm way up here.

1026
01:18:00,443 --> 01:18:04,232
And that stinky Baphomet
is way down there,

1027
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,863
and worshipping him first
is against the rules,

1028
01:18:06,908 --> 01:18:08,740
and breaking the rules
makes me poopy.

1029
01:18:08,785 --> 01:18:10,242
What did you do?

1030
01:18:10,286 --> 01:18:13,450
Silly billies.
They think they're so strong.

1031
01:18:13,498 --> 01:18:16,081
There's always someone stronger.

1032
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:17,991
I'll show them.

1033
01:18:18,044 --> 01:18:19,535
Spin me!

1034
01:18:19,587 --> 01:18:21,249
♪ There's always someone
stronger ♪

1035
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:23,289
♪ There's always someone
meaner ♪

1036
01:18:26,928 --> 01:18:30,171
I'm the biggest meanie
of them all.

1037
01:18:30,223 --> 01:18:31,964
Bunnies!

1038
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,277
So, what happens now?

1039
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:49,360
Mr. Bunny's gonna teach them
a lesson.

1040
01:18:49,409 --> 01:18:51,526
Uh, and what about me?

1041
01:18:51,578 --> 01:18:53,820
You're going to have to
ask Mr. Bunny.

1042
01:18:57,166 --> 01:19:00,830
Uh, what about me, Mr. Bunny?

1043
01:19:02,672 --> 01:19:04,789
Mr. Bunny says
you helped me tonight.

1044
01:19:04,841 --> 01:19:06,673
So we'll kill you fast.

1045
01:19:06,718 --> 01:19:09,005
Uh, look, can't Mr. Bunny
just let me go home?

1046
01:19:09,053 --> 01:19:10,760
Mr. Bunny's a meanie.

1047
01:19:10,805 --> 01:19:12,137
Code of the Sams.

1048
01:19:12,181 --> 01:19:13,797
What?

1049
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:15,933
Y-You said that breaking
the rules makes you poopy.

1050
01:19:15,977 --> 01:19:18,060
What about code of the Sams?

1051
01:19:18,104 --> 01:19:20,517
Samaziel.

1052
01:19:20,565 --> 01:19:22,181
Sam.

1053
01:19:22,233 --> 01:19:24,725
I mean, you have to help me.
It's... It's the rule.

1054
01:19:24,777 --> 01:19:26,484
You made that up.

1055
01:19:26,529 --> 01:19:28,065
Are you sure?

1056
01:19:28,114 --> 01:19:30,527
'Cause there's like
seven million Sams in the world,

1057
01:19:30,575 --> 01:19:32,052
and you're the first one
I've ever met

1058
01:19:32,076 --> 01:19:34,409
that's never heard of
