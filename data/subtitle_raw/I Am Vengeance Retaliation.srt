1
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:25,956
Stop right there.

2
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,504
Get on the floor now.

3
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,846
Ladies.

4
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,190
I wouldn't do that.

5
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,695
Who the fuck are you?
What do you want?

6
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,196
Lucy Swanson.

7
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,992
Lucy was here a week ago
on a night out with her friends.

8
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,828
Thing is, this is the
last place she was seen.

9
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,790
Do you know how many bored
little rich girls run away from home?

10
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,625
Happens every
day in the big city.

11
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:12,419
Unfortunately,

12
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,922
your boys did a terrible job
of disposing of the evidence.

13
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,258
The police found
her body last night.

14
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,427
Lucy's parents
are friends of mine,

15
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,846
- so here I am.
- So here you are.

16
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,431
So what now, then?

17
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:28,143
Now, turn yourselves
in and confess.

18
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,520
And what happens
if we say fuck you?

19
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,275
- That.
- Kill this fucking prick.

20
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,639
Haven't lost your touch, I see.

21
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,724
Frost. What are you doing here?

22
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,143
Got something to tell you.

23
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,144
Nope.

24
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,190
Don't you want to
know how I found you?

25
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,776
Satellites, cameras, et cetera?

26
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,154
John, look, I needed to
speak to you face to face.

27
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,281
About a job.

28
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,534
How many times?

29
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,369
Not. Interested.

30
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,787
You will be this time.

31
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,871
It's Teague.

32
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,793
Sean Teague is dead.

33
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,795
This was taken yesterday.

34
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,300
The operative who sent it was deep
undercover for the past two years.

35
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:43,820
He was about to
take his targets down

36
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,638
when he was introduced to an arms
dealer that turned out to be Teague.

37
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,724
I'm putting a team together to catch
Teague, and I want you to lead it.

38
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,727
You want me to bring
Teague in... alive?

39
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,373
I know what he did to you and your
team, but we need Teague breathing.

40
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,775
His intel and contacts alone are enough
to bring down the baddest of the bad.

41
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,320
Come on, do it for your country.

42
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,281
Oh, that's rich coming from you.

43
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,991
Okay, do it for yourself, then.

44
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,493
- Meaning?
- Meaning you bring Teague in,

45
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:12,497
in one piece, the department
wipes your slate clean.

46
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,333
All is forgiven.
No more running.

47
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,835
Think about it, John.

48
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,423
Bring Teague in alive, and
you get your life back again.

49
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,998
Gentlemen. Ladies.

50
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,750
You all know Commander Grayson.

51
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,877
- Morning, everyone.
- Morning.

52
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,881
Our target: Sean Teague.

53
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,927
As you all know, Teague
was an elite operative,

54
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,930
one of our best, until
he turned on his team

55
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,892
during their final mission in
Eastern Europe several years ago.

56
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:17,687
Many of them met
with rather grisly ends.

57
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,897
Quite.

58
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,860
After going rogue, Teague was responsible
for the deaths of dozens of personnel,

59
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,155
as well as countless civilians in
mercenary operations across the globe.

60
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:31,785
Arms deals, smuggling
state secrets, assassinations.

61
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,162
You name it, Teague
profited from it.

62
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,414
Well, yeah, he did.

63
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,917
Until he was reported killed
two years ago in the ♪.R.C.

64
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,795
Yes, well, we've
all heard that story.

65
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,006
Authorities on the ground confirmed
that Teague had been killed,

66
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,300
but he's here now, and
we're going to bring him in.

67
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,053
Who's the tree trunk?

68
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,306
You're kidding. It's
only John fucking Gold.

69
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,141
- Get away.
- Uh-huh.

70
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,437
Wonder how many
people he's killed this week.

71
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,855
Five.

72
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,941
So far.

73
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,318
Nice to meet you.

74
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:06,820
Likewise.

75
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,239
Lynch and Shapiro, you've
somewhat preempted me.

76
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,200
Everybody, meet John Gold.

77
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,707
Nobody knows Teague better
than Gold, especially in the field.

78
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,042
And nobody has a more
compelling reason to bring him in.

79
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,006
From what I've heard, you'll more
likely put a bullet behind Teague's ear

80
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,422
than put him behind bars.

81
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,215
People do like
to talk, don't they?

82
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,635
Your mission is breach
Teague's location,

83
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,722
transport him to an
off-the-books airbase,

84
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:39,102
then fly him to an ever-so-hush-hush
black site secure facility,

85
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,980
where he'll live out
his days in a steel box.

86
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,106
So what's the play, boss?

87
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,733
Gold here will lead,

88
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:48,862
with you two reprobates providing
ground support and flying/driving services.

89
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,990
- Shit work. Standard.
- That's what we get paid for.

90
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,994
What? They pay you for this?

91
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,329
That's enough, you two.

92
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:02,125
Kelso, Plachecki and Stiles, you'll
serve and support the operation from here.

93
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,251
Any questions?

94
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,214
'Course not. I'll
see you at the R.V.

95
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,513
I'm sorry we can't give you the
support you need for this one, John.

96
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:18,850
You know I can't be seen
to authorize a full team.

97
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,478
If news about Teague
being alive got out,

98
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,022
top brass will have
a major flap-on.

99
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,024
But Lynch and Shapiro
are two of the best.

100
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,530
Believe it or not.

101
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,991
A team can be a liability.

102
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,494
Teague taught me that.

103
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,067
Morning, lads.

104
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,068
- Boss.
- Boss.

105
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,611
Nice morning for it.

106
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,196
- Heard from Pearl yet?
- Not yet.

107
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,281
We agreed on radio
silence until she arrives.

108
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,658
Yeah, yeah, just in case.

109
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,078
Pretty smart... coming from you.

110
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:35,593
Okay, lads, we're here for the
duration until we hear from Pearl.

111
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,220
Smoke 'em if you've got 'em.

112
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,304
Come on.

113
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,814
What's all this?

114
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,276
What? Oh, uh, nothing.

115
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,365
What is all this?

116
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,493
[, uh...

117
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,371
I-1 really need a piss.

118
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,623
So go take a piss.

119
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,375
What am I, your mother?

120
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,447
Better than sex!

121
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,824
Then you're doing it wrong.

122
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,506
Fuck!

123
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,728
Steady!

124
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,235
As I live and
breathe. John Gold.

125
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,238
Teague. You're coming with me.

126
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,740
Yeah, of course I am.

127
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:03,825
Lads!

128
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:29,767
Bennett, move!

129
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,580
Go.

130
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,145
Go, go, go.

131
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,608
Teague!

132
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,906
Teague! Hands in the air!

133
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,617
Don't stop us now. We're
just starting to have some fun.

134
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,619
Assume the position.

135
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,121
Or what?

136
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,631
To be continued.

137
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,385
Are you sure you're
going to make our window?

138
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,447
We've got a tight timeframe
to get that plane in the air.

139
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,014
Yeah, we'll make it.

140
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,892
Our E.T.A's about 60 minutes.

141
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,703
Okay, great. Just get
Teague to that airbase,

142
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,522
- and we can all breathe out.
- Yep, copy that.

143
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,568
Lynch and Shapiro are securing
Teague, and we'll be on our way in a few.

144
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,404
Just make sure that
plane is good to go.

145
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,740
Twat's ready for transport.

146
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,909
Hey, you're going nowhere, mate.

147
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,411
Here's Prince Charming now.

148
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,247
I'll keep you
updated. Stay frosty.

149
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,583
Yeah, funny, I've
never heard that before.

150
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,754
This is excellent, by the way.

151
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:04,922
I know.

152
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,427
Good to go.

153
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,138
Believe it or not, Teague,
this is all for your own good.

154
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,891
You're being flown to a
remote, black site prison

155
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,810
"cause there's too many people out
here that want your head on a pike."

156
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:18,936
People like you?

157
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,941
You're a traitor, you're a murderer,
and you sacrificed our own team.

158
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:27,528
Now, you either pay
for those crimes this way,

159
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,947
or someone's going to
tear you limb from limb.

160
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,575
Alleged crimes.

161
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,952
And I'm supposed to
believe all this from a man

162
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,079
who wants to see me
dead more than most?

163
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:42,460
For my own good,
eh? That's bullshit.

164
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:46,964
Let's go.

165
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,640
Get in! Get in!

166
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,189
I knew it... you're
trying to kill me!

167
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,358
Don't be ridiculous,
we'd just let him do it.

168
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,859
Anyone got eyes on the shooter?

169
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,991
Right, we need a
volunteer to draw their fire.

170
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,543
Fuck off.

171
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,592
- Fucking...!
- Where are they?

172
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,719
Three o'clock, tower.

173
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,013
Probably one of Teague's...

174
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,225
- No, Teague's the target.
- Bollocks.

175
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,227
Whoa...

176
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,398
- Maybe.
- Let's go.

177
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,899
On it.

178
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,526
- Mine.
- Really?

179
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,329
Lynch! Step on it.

180
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,248
Hold onto your balls back there.

181
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,548
Talk to me.

182
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,551
We had an unexpected
guest, but we're on our way.

183
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,302
Any idea who it was?

184
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,846
Not a clue, but they
wanted Teague's head.

185
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,180
And nearly got it.

186
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,058
I'll keep you posted.

187
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,563
We're on our way, people.

188
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,064
Take it steady.

189
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:35,072
Hey, hope you've got some nice, hot
stewardesses on this flight for me, John.

190
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:39,160
I wouldn't get your hopes up, Teague.
You're going to prison, not Ibiza.

191
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,883
And they're called
cabin crew these days.

192
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,957
Touch a nerve there, did 1?

193
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,929
Oh, for... We've got incoming.

194
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,617
Shit!

195
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,118
Lynch, floor it!

196
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,997
Come on, then.

197
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,146
Shit.

198
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,984
Dead end!

199
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,371
Brace! Brace!

200
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,664
Move! Now!

201
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,186
- Everyone all right?
- Fuck off.

202
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,563
Lynch, you okay?

203
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,023
Yeah, just great.

204
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,697
Look, I don't give a shit
about whoever's out there.

205
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,701
But you either give me a gun or
you get me the fuck out of here.

206
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:47,371
Someone's finally got to the big,
bad, tough-as-fuck Sean Teague.

207
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,207
I'll shake them by the hand.

208
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,586
Gold.

209
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,214
Check this out.

210
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,633
You think we can make
it over to that factory?

211
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,052
Yeah, that'll do for now.

212
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:07,141
Okay, I'll draw his fire,
you two follow Lynch.

213
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,935
I'll catch up to you once
I've dealt with our new friend.

214
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,830
Or we could just hand
Teague over to whoever that is.

215
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,105
You're supposed to protect me.

216
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:14,732
Tell me again what my job is?

217
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,233
Shapiro.

218
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,735
You see, John?

219
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,570
That's what it comes down to.

220
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,739
Me, and a quarter-ounce of lead.

221
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,243
Don't tempt me.

222
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,456
Guys, if we're going,
we should go now.

223
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,751
Right, then.

224
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:48,474
Move!

225
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,266
Who the fuck are you?

226
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,675
Greetings.

227
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,022
Now this... This
is gonna be fun.

228
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,863
- How are we doing?
- We got held up again.

229
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,865
Our new friend took out our van.

230
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,366
There's something else.

231
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,368
We were attacked
by another team.

232
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:33,954
As in a different team
that attacked both of you?

233
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:42,379
That is what the sentence
that I just said would mean, yes.

234
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:43,881
Any idea who they were?

235
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:47,885
I didn't hang around to find out.
I'm regrouping with the others now.

236
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,562
Okay.

237
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:03,400
We're not authorized, but fuck
this sitting on our thumbs shit.

238
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:06,695
I'm going in there to
help our guys. Fancy it?

239
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:09,698
Just say the word.

240
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,450
That's what I like to hear.

241
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,285
Let's get going, people.

242
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:24,505
- How long should we give it?
- Ten minutes?

243
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,924
I mean, we can't
wait much longer.

244
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,430
Who was that back there?

245
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:36,058
Didn't get a name.

246
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,769
They're still out there.
Some others too.

247
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,145
Others like who?

248
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:43,315
No idea. You?

249
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,942
How the fuck do I know?

250
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,443
So it could be anyone, then.

251
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,654
Right, we need to
get to that airbase.

252
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,448
Take a look around, see if
we can find some wheels.

253
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:53,867
You lot don't know what
you've got yourselves into.

254
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:54,951
Quiet!

255
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,083
Move!

256
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,317
Gold.

257
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,499
Gold.

258
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,501
Gold!

259
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,922
That's it. Get up.

260
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:57,014
Say hello to my boys,
and my beautiful fiancée.

261
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,477
We're going to use
this to keep track of you.

262
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,272
How long does it take to work?

263
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,675
Should already
be up and running.

264
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,028
We're good.

265
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:13,864
Just don't lose that phone.

266
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,952
I told you there'd be no
plane for me, didn't 1?

267
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:20,537
You just wouldn't listen.

268
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,164
You're going nowhere, Teague.

269
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,999
It's Mr. Teague to you.

270
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,043
Cut these, Gunnar.

271
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,423
Keep them here.

272
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,259
Any trouble, you
kill the chick first.

273
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,552
Fuck you!

274
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,057
You got it, boss.

275
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,576
When you're all done
with the womanfolk...

276
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:04,581
why don't you just come show
us how tough you really are?

277
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,727
I'm gonna need this.

278
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,606
Moan feebly if that's okay.

279
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,485
Good. Right.

280
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,613
I'm gonna go kill those guys,
while you go after Teague.

281
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:38,323
Right...

282
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:40,284
But don't engage him.

283
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,952
Just let me know where you are.

284
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,120
Yeah, but hold on. I...

285
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,203
Hey, Gold!

286
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,250
I always heard you were some
kind of one-man killing machine.

287
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,128
So, what're you waiting for?

288
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,965
Hang on, I'll be through in a
second to kick your teeth in.

289
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,179
Go find Teague, and let
me know where you are.

290
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,639
We'll get him together.

291
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:06,143
Okay. Don't get
killed and stuff.

292
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,187
You too.

293
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,153
Right, then.

294
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,532
You all right, mate?

295
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:31,876
Finally.

296
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,172
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Gold.

297
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:36,255
Likewise.

298
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:39,009
So...

299
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,637
you're John Gold.

300
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,680
The John Gold?

301
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,182
Yep.

302
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:50,020
You know, Teague told us all these
stories about how bloodthirsty you are.

303
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:55,442
Yet here we all
are with... these.

304
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,819
And there you are with...

305
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,406
With that.

306
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,367
I mean, what're you
even going to do with...

307
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,061
- Kendrick, get the car.
- Okay.

308
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,730
- Be out of here in five.
- Knew you'd come through, babe.

309
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,232
Teague!

310
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,360
Stay where you are.

311
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,738
Look, we've got somewhere to
go. Why don't you just back off?

312
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:48,245
What? This shouldn't take long.

313
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,747
Yeah, you're right, it'll
take me about 30 seconds.

314
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,018
Maybe we should offer her a job.

315
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,821
Fuck...

316
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,878
Shoot him!

317
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,340
Say goodbye, prick-hole.

318
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:26,843
Shit!

319
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:27,844
Stoppage.

320
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,930
Okay, okay.

321
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,357
Let's get bloody.

322
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:51,368
- Get behind me.
- Do something, then.

323
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,122
Just stay back.

324
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:01,878
Step aside. This
isn't your fight.

325
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:04,381
Who are you? Who is she?

326
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:07,592
Long story, but
she should be dead.

327
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,970
Oh, your men tried all right.

328
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,013
You're trying to save
the life of a murderer,

329
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:15,600
which makes you naive at
best, but you're not my problem.

330
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:18,437
Just get out of my way,
I don't want to hurt you.

331
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,440
Then don't. But I'm not moving.

332
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:23,608
We're taking Teague
to prison, to face justice.

333
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:25,402
This is justice!

334
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,411
Well, come on, do it!

335
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,621
Don't rush me!

336
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,416
I'm killing a hero here.

337
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,252
It's a big moment for me.

338
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,425
Any last words?

339
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:54,639
Prepare to be
deeply embarrassed.

340
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:01,855
He's a live one, all right!

341
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:07,152
But not for long.

342
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,406
Here it comes.

343
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,458
Well, stop dicking
around and kill him!

344
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,459
I'm trying...

345
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,593
Last chance. Walk away.

346
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,013
Okay.

347
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,392
I tried.

348
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,505
All right.

349
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,520
Getting paid
overtime for this, right?

350
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,680
Well, thanks for all your help.

351
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,318
You okay?

352
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,946
Where's Lynch?

353
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,742
Right, I'll deal with that,
you go cover the entrance.

354
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,161
We don't need any
more unexpected guests.

355
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,746
Roger that.

356
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,389
Use this.

357
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,255
Stand back, babe.

358
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,136
Come on, babe! Let's go.

359
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,521
If you...

360
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:14,463
Teague!

361
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,078
You want to have
a go hand-to-hand?

362
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,140
Yeah, I fancy my chances.

363
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,168
Hey. Whoever you are.

364
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,629
I can see you've
got your reasons,

365
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,215
but let us bring
Teague in the right way.

366
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,591
You don't understand, he...

367
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,690
Dumb fucking luck!

368
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,444
You're amazing, but give it up.

369
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:18,695
Get real!

370
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,747
Gold!

371
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:30,290
Lynch! Hold on!

372
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:18,254
You okay?

373
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,256
We had a disagreement.

374
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,925
That's her specialty.

375
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,426
Long time, no see, Jen.

376
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,053
You know her?

377
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,931
Jen Quaid. I served
with her father.

378
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,432
Until Teague ended all that.

379
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,311
Let me go, Gold. I've
got no problem with you.

380
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,980
Not this time. We're
taking Teague to prison.

381
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:39,108
Three square meals a day
and a roof over his head?

382
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:41,945
After everything he's done?

383
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,781
That's not nearly
enough, and you know it.

384
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,544
I'm amazed you haven't
killed him yourself.

385
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,409
He's come close.

386
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:51,204
This is bigger than what
Teague's done to either of us.

387
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:55,208
You've got clean
hands, is that it?

388
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,127
My dad told me
about every mission.

389
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,631
All the horrible, fucked-up
shit you guys did together.

390
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,383
And that's my point.

391
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,301
Do you want to end up like us?

392
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:08,638
We both know that's not the
path your dad wanted for you.

393
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,141
So don't make this
harder than it has to be.

394
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,003
He's off again.

395
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,337
What do you want me to do?

396
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:43,882
Call Frost. Check on Shapiro.

397
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:46,009
Then catch up with me.

398
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,928
I'll catch you later.

399
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,266
Boss.

400
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,559
- Lynch?
- Yeah, it's me.

401
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,519
- Go ahead.
- We caught up with the sniper.

402
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:58,271
Name's Jen Quaid.

403
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,898
Christ, really?

404
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:01,524
Gold and I worked
with her old man.

405
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,359
Yeah, that's right.

406
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,987
She's tied up on the upper
level of our current location,

407
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,864
- if you want to pick her up.
- Copy that.

408
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:16,539
I've got Gold after me, and
I've got Jen Quaid after me,

409
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,875
so come and pick me up now.

410
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,501
We've got your position.

411
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,295
Just keep moving,
and we'll come to you.

412
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:29,385
Gunnar, Price. Let's get movin'.

413
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:34,140
It's okay, chum. It's okay.

414
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,786
Even if you get Teague
to that prison cell,

415
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,412
how long do you
think he'll last?

416
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,081
That's not my problem.

417
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,833
My mission ends
once he's in that cell.

418
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:03,169
All the shit Teague
has on the government.

419
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:07,632
All those black bag, disavowable
jobs he did with my dad and Gold?

420
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,427
They just want him in there so that
they can make sure he dies on their terms.

421
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:13,846
Well, seeing as you want
Teague dead so badly,

422
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,515
why don't you
let us bring him in,

423
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,433
and he'll get what
you think he deserves.

424
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:18,517
No!

425
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:22,689
I have to kill him myself.

426
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:26,943
Jen.

427
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,448
Jen.

428
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,482
Do you really think your dad
would want you to go through

429
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:40,957
all this emotional agony and
violence, just to murder this one man?

430
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:43,960
Yes.

431
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:48,965
Okay, that's not
crazy or anything.

432
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,299
See you around.

433
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,720
Preferably not.

434
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,439
You're coming with me.

435
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,607
I'm going nowhere with you.

436
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,109
We don't have time for this.

437
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,819
You're not listening to me.

438
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,446
Or do you want me
to beat it into you?

439
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,740
I said we don't
have time for this.

440
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:16,117
How many of your mates
did I have killed again?

441
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,287
They were good men.

442
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,498
And you sold them
out for cold, hard cash.

443
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:24,500
I didn't do it for the
money, and you know that!

444
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,252
Teague! Just listen...

445
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:39,265
Just like old times.

446
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,517
Always did like giving the
orders, didn't you, John?

447
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,233
This is your last warning.

448
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:52,111
If it wasn't for me, Jen Quaid
would have killed you by now.

449
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,614
If it weren't for you slowing
me down, I'd have killed her!

450
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,062
I put everything on
the line for this country,

451
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:29,273
and I get made the scapegoat
for mistakes made over my head.

452
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:32,276
Shit rolls downhill.
You know that.

453
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,780
Years of loyal service, and I
get thrown on the scrapheap.

454
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,449
Well, that's no excuse for
betraying your own team.

455
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,128
You wouldn't understand
until it happened to you.

456
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,423
Why don't you
just admit it, John?

457
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,926
You're enjoying this.

458
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:01,430
That's it. That's the
Gold I remember.

459
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,015
Come on!

460
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,282
Lynch advised that
Qaid is on the upper level.

461
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:21,283
Be ready to move in.

462
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,049
Is this what you want?

463
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:39,135
Is this what you fucking want?

464
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,055
Enough...

465
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,474
Are you fucking
happy now, Teague?

466
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:47,560
Gold!

467
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:52,648
Hey, John.

468
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,653
You're killing him.

469
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:14,879
I'll call the team
to pick us up.

470
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:19,050
No. Let's just get to
the airbase ourselves.

471
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,677
The three of us will be
harder for Jen to track.

472
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,679
You really think Jen's
still gonna be a problem?

473
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:26,182
There's one thing you need
to know about Jen Quaid.

474
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:29,477
She's always going
to be a problem.

475
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:33,689
Hello, boys.

476
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,692
Frost.

477
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:38,361
You know the routine, Jen.

478
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,697
Down on the ground.
Hands behind your head.

479
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,339
All right?

480
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,883
I want a chat about hazard
pay, but apart from that...

481
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,719
I'm a-okay.

482
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:06,722
Jen, I had a lot of
respect for your old man.

483
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:09,225
But we have to treat
you as an active threat,

484
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:12,019
so just behave and
let us bring you in.

485
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,107
What're we doing?

486
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,859
She's just some chick.
She's not even strapped.

487
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:22,738
That "chick" nearly
killed us all. Twice.

488
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,449
She's amazing.

489
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:30,246
Kelso. Cuff her.

490
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:45,636
Take cover!

491
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,648
Let's find some wheels.

492
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:02,028
This is a wild goose chase.

493
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:04,113
I'm done, I ain't
going any further.

494
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,825
Fine.

495
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,452
You stay here, then,

496
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,997
wait for Jen to catch up
and shoot you in the head.

497
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:27,219
You fucking arsehole.

498
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:42,109
Hold fire! Hold fire!

499
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:45,821
Jen!

500
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:47,323
This is your last chance!

501
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:49,867
Surrender!

502
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,828
Right now!

503
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:00,836
Check it out.

504
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:08,344
Be careful. She's much more
dangerous than she looks.

505
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,932
Okay, on me.

506
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,926
Foyer clear.

507
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,720
You two, clear the upper
floor. We'll check this level.

508
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:54,223
<i>- RV. back here.
- Roger that. Let's go.</i>

509
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:56,892
Keep comms open.

510
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:59,979
- You heard the boss. Don't get brave.
- Understood.

511
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:30,551
Just some chick?

512
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,677
I didn't mean...

513
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,398
Someone talk to me.

514
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,984
What's going on?

515
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,501
You okay?

516
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:56,178
Kelso?

517
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,555
Stiles?

518
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:37,052
What about this one?

519
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:56,739
Yeah. I can work with this.

520
00:51:58,324 --> 00:51:59,644
You think you
can get it running?

521
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:02,077
Please.

522
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,542
Gold?

523
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,385
Cheers.

524
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,130
Right, straight to the airbase.

525
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,466
- Roger that.
- You hear that, Teague?

526
00:52:57,549 --> 00:53:00,427
Very soon we'll be
flying the friendly skies.

527
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:03,138
We'll see about that.

528
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:20,406
How's that, Gunnar babe?

529
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:24,660
You look quite lovely, miss.

530
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,500
Not far now. Take the next left.

531
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,086
You got it.

532
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,599
Okay.

533
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:51,186
Okay. So she got one over on me.

534
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,230
Can one of you at least
give me something to wear?

535
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,233
Sure. Here.

536
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,698
Quaid deactivated the
vehicle tracking system.

537
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:05,617
- She could be anywhere.
- Smart move.

538
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:07,453
Come on, you lot.
Let's get moving.

539
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,968
We're making good
time. Not far now.

540
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:26,054
Yeah, as long as this rust
bucket makes it that far.

541
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:53,749
Jesus...!

542
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:55,250
Come on, we've got to move.

543
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,007
This way, Mr. Teague.

544
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:04,551
That's fucked, innit?

545
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,094
Teague!

546
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:07,721
Let's go.

547
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:12,267
Sean! Come on, let's go.

548
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,245
You okay?

549
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:35,290
I'm seeing three of you.
Other than that, I'm good.

550
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:38,752
Right, I'm going
to go after them.

551
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:41,380
You R.V. with Frost, and
I'll see you at the airbase.

552
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,463
On it.

553
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,642
Fucker don't know when to quit.

554
00:55:57,813 --> 00:55:58,814
I've got this.

555
00:56:01,525 --> 00:56:02,526
Guard her with your life.

556
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,910
- What's he doing?
- He needs to see this through, miss.

557
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,839
This fucking guy.

558
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,801
Go and finish him.

559
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,223
Sean!

560
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,150
Not her again.

561
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,412
Shit.

562
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,254
Who is that?

563
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:09,384
That's the daughter of a
man I killed a long time ago.

564
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,389
Gold.

565
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:16,808
Jen, listen...

566
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:19,353
I understand why you
want to kill Teague.

567
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:22,147
And trust me, I want
to put a bullet in him too.

568
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,899
But it's not gonna
bring back my men.

569
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:27,402
And it's not gonna
bring back your dad.

570
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:32,407
So, please, help me
to do this the right way.

571
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:42,125
Here.

572
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:46,630
- Kill them both.
- You got it.

573
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,759
You get Teague,
I'll get the other guy.

574
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,810
Not bad.

575
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,497
We've got to make that plane.

576
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,000
Why the fuck would I
go anywhere with you?

577
00:58:23,083 --> 00:58:26,461
Well, in case you've
forgotten, that's Jen Quaid.

578
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:29,464
You know he's killed
his own men, right?

579
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:31,967
- Really going to take his money?
- I'm a mercenary.

580
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:35,470
The clue is in the
job description.

581
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:38,890
A highly trained killing machine
who's been following you all day,

582
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:43,103
and so far everything you've
tried to do to stop her has failed.

583
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:47,482
Now, are you sure your guy's
got what it takes to bring her down?

584
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:53,280
"Cause I've got to
be honest with you..."

585
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:55,991
My money's on her.

586
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:10,130
Now, move it!

587
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:37,532
You know what?

588
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:40,035
I might just stick around
and see how this pans out.

589
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,291
You know...

590
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:49,044
I'm really starting
to enjoy this job.

591
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,302
Damn it, Jen.

592
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:03,391
I've got to say, fighting you
has been a bit of a thrill for me.

593
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,868
Best part is, you're next.

594
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:27,624
You did good, by the way.

595
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,085
You've got some moves.

596
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,422
And you've got fighting spirit.

597
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:40,470
But now it's time to say...

598
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:47,060
Come on, let's go.

599
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:51,481
Fucking prick.

600
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:55,819
Ah, fuck.

601
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,114
Sean! Go!

602
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,619
Price, Gunnar. Shoot them!

603
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:08,415
Go after Teague, I'll cover you.

604
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,376
You really want to take
on this lot by yourself?

605
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:12,460
You would.

606
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:20,594
Go now, before we lose him!

607
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:22,887
Take cover!

608
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:37,319
Gunnar, Price, move in.

609
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:52,250
Close in, we'll surround her.

610
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,047
Right, then.

611
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:06,014
Fuck me. You're like
herpes... I can't get rid of you.

612
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:08,683
On. Now.

613
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:09,935
Move in.

614
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,705
Shit.

615
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:34,084
She's a tricky one all right.

616
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:58,566
Room for one more?

617
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:06,616
That your summer
look or something?

618
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,743
Don't want to talk about it.

619
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:10,745
But where are your
trousers, though?

620
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:12,414
What's the latest?

621
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:14,416
Teague's men grabbed
him, and Gold was...

622
01:03:17,669 --> 01:03:20,380
Speak of the devil,
and he shall appear.

623
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,758
Gold, you're on speaker and
I'm with the gang, so no sexy talk.

624
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:25,760
Gold! Let me off
this fucking thing!

625
01:03:25,844 --> 01:03:27,512
- So you got him again, then.
- Yup.

626
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,764
- I got some wheels too.
- Cool.

627
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:31,766
We'll be at the airbase
in about ten minutes.

628
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:34,269
Roger that. I'll see you soon.

629
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,271
You heard the man, let's go.

630
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:53,204
Fucking dead man,
Gold, do you hear me?

631
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:55,206
Fucking dead man.

632
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:56,791
You might want to hold on tight.

633
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:58,793
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

634
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,478
Well? Did you get her?

635
01:04:46,925 --> 01:04:49,010
- Enjoy the ride?
- You're a prick.

636
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:52,347
Any more trouble out of you, and
I'll be carrying you onto that plane.

637
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:55,266
And how much trouble
do you think I can get in?

638
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,351
Just move.

639
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:17,872
Your gun, please.

640
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:26,464
That's what I'm talking about.

641
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:34,889
Now the keys, please.

642
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:38,893
You know, you might be the most
polite mercenary I've ever encountered.

643
01:05:38,977 --> 01:05:40,562
That's very kind of you to say.

644
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,278
And we're taking the plane.

645
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:51,906
We're flying out of here.

646
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:55,410
No, you're getting on that
plane, and you're going to prison.

647
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,912
I've had enough of this
you-and-me bollocks.

648
01:05:57,996 --> 01:05:59,539
Get on your knees.

649
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:05,170
Do as you're told.

650
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,761
You might want to
stand back, darling.

651
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:19,934
This is over.

652
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:22,937
Now.

653
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:24,021
Hey, Teague.

654
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:27,669
That was quite the entrance.

655
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,796
Dad always said I was dramatic.

656
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:36,010
Shit. Teague's guys
are already here.

657
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:38,471
Stiles. Take point.

658
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:14,299
Let's go get these bastards.

659
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:24,058
Okay, stay here, you'll be safe.

660
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:26,185
Do what you've got to do.

661
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:41,576
Move in.

662
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:56,591
I'm nearly out.

663
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:57,759
You?

664
01:08:58,885 --> 01:09:01,095
Don't ask.

665
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:53,230
Go!

666
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:03,658
Fuck.

667
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:41,195
Believe it or not, this is
how I killed your old man!

668
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:04,051
Let's just go!

669
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:09,682
No, I can't, I've got to stay.

670
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:11,559
- No.
- I've got to finish this.

671
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:26,323
John!

672
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:29,744
You're really starting to
fucking irritate me now.

673
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:35,750
In my office.

674
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:56,145
Just... Kill him... already!

675
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,685
Ladies.

676
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,354
Ladies.

677
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:24,358
Do you really think
you can take me?

678
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:18,597
Fuck...

679
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:37,658
It's your choice.

680
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:40,554
Jen...

681
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:19,677
I've been there.

682
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:29,270
What're we going
to do with him now?

683
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:31,147
This ain't over, John.

684
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:33,607
Believe me, this ain't over.

685
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:37,111
I'm coming for
your friends, John!

686
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:39,196
I'm coming for your kids, John!

687
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,115
I'm coming for your dog!

688
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:45,619
Well, it may not be a
plane, but he's on his way.

689
01:17:45,703 --> 01:17:46,954
Well done.

690
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:51,625
We'll debrief tomorrow at 0900.

691
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,127
Did we win this one, then?

692
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:56,130
Beers are on me, so I guess.

693
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:01,969
Victory. Yay.

694
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:07,141
I'll see you in the pub.

695
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:16,812
You know, Teague's probably
gonna die in that prison.

696
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:20,445
Maybe.

697
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,074
But I can live with
him being behind bars.

698
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,162
Think I can too.

699
01:18:28,245 --> 01:18:31,373
Or I could just break in and
kill him if I change my mind.

700
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:41,175
So.

701
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:42,676
So?

702
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:45,179
How's it feel to be
a free man again?

703
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:48,682
It's all right.

704
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:52,186
Come on, let's get plastered.
