1
00:00:22,846 --> 00:00:28,454
The 41st millenium

2
00:00:36,673 --> 00:00:41,663
The Imperium of Mankind

3
00:00:48,343 --> 00:00:54,846
stretches across the entire galaxy.

4
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:14,579
Still, tremendous wars
rage at its frontiers.

5
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:24,049
As well as within.

6
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:31,120
Only a merciless authority

7
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:35,907
full of cruelty and scorn

8
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:42,007
is capable of keeping
the Imperium together.

9
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:49,915
United in the faith
in their god-like Emperor

10
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:55,490
humanity has no alternative

11
00:01:55,662 --> 00:02:01,407
than to accept their fate.

12
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,378
But mankind changes,

13
00:02:07,372 --> 00:02:10,549
Psykers are born.

14
00:02:11,774 --> 00:02:17,273
Mutants with supernatural skills.

15
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:26,727
They are the gateway to the Empyrean,

16
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:33,069
a parallel dimension flushed with energy,

17
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:38,644
Which made journeys
between the stars possible.

18
00:02:43,853 --> 00:02:49,612
But inside the Immaterium
the emotions of the living gather

19
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:52,842
and take shape ...

20
00:02:56,693 --> 00:03:00,605
Those personified nightmares

21
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:06,312
are haunting mankind as daemons.

22
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:12,556
And their dark gods

23
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,994
have only one intention:

24
00:03:16,242 --> 00:03:20,757
The subjugation
of the substantial universe.

25
00:03:30,273 --> 00:03:31,973
Inquisitor Lessus.

26
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:35,744
We will soon exit the Immaterium.

27
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,871
The warp abnormality ...

28
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:46,099
it grew bigger.

29
00:03:46,713 --> 00:03:50,167
We have never arrived too late.

30
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:02,208
Inquisitor!

31
00:04:02,484 --> 00:04:05,773
We regret that we
cannot come to your support.

32
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:09,850
Eldar forces are blocking
the Strait of Calix.

33
00:04:09,992 --> 00:04:12,030
Proceed with your mission.

34
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:14,222
For the Emperor!

35
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:44,676
It is the holy duty

36
00:04:44,876 --> 00:04:47,466
of the covertly working

37
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:51,406
Imperial Inquisition

38
00:04:51,506 --> 00:04:56,769
to hold this menace at bay.

39
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:03,255
All over the galaxy

40
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,031
they are searching

41
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:11,710
for the merest hint of corruption

42
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:17,357
by the rotting seeds of chaos cults.

43
00:05:22,272 --> 00:05:26,052
The merciless Inquisitors

44
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,487
are authorised

45
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:31,455
to attack

46
00:05:31,794 --> 00:05:34,317
the enemies of the Imperium

47
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:41,833
at any time, by any means,

48
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,736
to annihilate them.

49
00:08:40,718 --> 00:08:44,458
Welcome back, son of the Conclave.

50

He that committeth no sin, on his knees!

Come on, Nira.

62
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:14,179
Are you dreaming again?

63
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,677
I really wonder what this is all about!

64
00:12:56,812 --> 00:12:58,698
Even recruits would be better for this ops.

65
00:13:07,571 --> 00:13:11,570
Remember: If they refuse, kill them all.

66
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:14,298
You know our orders.

67
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:27,516
Osmar Adeodatus, Planetary Defence Force

68
00:13:27,622 --> 00:13:31,037
Sancta Heroica Theta, Special Forces Legion.

69
00:13:31,195 --> 00:13:33,459
Hieronymus VI. von Remus,

70
00:13:33,494 --> 00:13:35,052
Sergeant Corris,

71
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:36,961
Wodan Dubrovnik,

72
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:39,352
as well as the absent Oktavian

73
00:13:39,424 --> 00:13:40,796
are as of now put

74
00:13:40,896 --> 00:13:43,684
under the command
of the Planetary Defence Force.

75
00:13:43,884 --> 00:13:45,108
What!?

76
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:47,926
During operation 312003

77
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:49,450
you will be accompanied and supported

78
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,247
by Nira Gippus of the Scholastika Psykana,

79
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:53,833
and by myself.

80
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:57,168
A witch! Hell, I like it!

81
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,935
What is this operation about?

82
00:14:00,035 --> 00:14:01,279
Suspicious subjects
are rumoured to have gathered

83
00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:04,366
in the old manufactorum inside depth 69.

84
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:05,747
Our assignment is

85
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:07,635
to scan this forbidden gathering

86
00:14:07,735 --> 00:14:11,192
and, should the need arise,
cleanse and purge it.

87
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:16,841
How much?

88
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,257
There will be no pay.

89
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,366
This order came from the highest authority:

90
00:14:20,566 --> 00:14:22,276
The Inquisition!

91
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:31,256
How can we get to the lowest depth?

92
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:35,087
We have to take the old supply tubes
in the north east section of the hive.

93
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,755
Thatís why we have to depart
as soon as possible.

94
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:39,343
What about the old assembly tunnels

95
00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:41,386
inside the... Macharius-wing?

96
00:14:41,406 --> 00:14:42,925
Donít they go straight down?

97
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:45,150
Those have not been used for centuries. 

98
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:47,745
It is strictly forbidden
to disturb the machine spirits.

99
00:14:47,901 --> 00:14:50,584
We have someone
who gets along with them pretty well.

100
00:14:50,748 --> 00:14:53,964
The sooner we finish this job
the better it is for all of us.

101
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:57,351
Well, then weíll meet there.

102
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:59,702
I guess I made myself clear.

103
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:01,683
When will you be ready for action?

104
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:06,491
In six hours at the earliest.

105
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:08,554
Three hours!

106
00:15:08,663 --> 00:15:10,952
For the Emperor!

107
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,286
Into the Eye with the Inquisition!

108
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,878
I wonít do any dirty work for them!

109
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:30,589
Come on, letís get the hell out of here
while we still can!

110
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:32,912
You can outrun anybody, Wodan.

111
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:34,565
But not them. You know that.

112
00:15:34,872 --> 00:15:36,276
Nevertheless...

113
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:38,755
somethingís awry with this.

114
00:15:38,849 --> 00:15:40,524
- Why us?
- Exactly.

115
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:43,718
We havenít had any big operations recently.

116
00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:45,733
And finally this female psyker!

117
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,474
I had the feeling all along

118
00:15:47,606 --> 00:15:49,235
that she was reading my thoughts.

119
00:15:49,331 --> 00:15:51,521
She didnít have
a great deal to do with that.

120
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,916
Weíll see.

121
00:15:53,928 --> 00:15:56,064
Hold this position and prepare yourselves,

122
00:15:56,232 --> 00:15:58,671
Iíll tell Oktavian the news.

123
00:16:04,656 --> 00:16:07,832
Await my complete report within 24 hours.

124
00:16:08,004 --> 00:16:10,251
Signed: Adeodatus

125
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:12,599
Dismissed!

126
00:16:17,293 --> 00:16:25,491
<i>(Prayer)</i>

127
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:34,652
One thing Iíd definitely
like to know, Wodan.

128
00:16:34,771 --> 00:16:36,373
What?

129
00:16:36,868 --> 00:16:40,415
Why are you so scared stiff
of humans with psionic abilities,

130
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,075
but have no reservations
regarding such strange guys like him?

131
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,618
Oktavian is only able to control machines.

132
00:16:46,718 --> 00:16:49,362
I am no fething machine!

133
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:53,844
At least not completely.

134
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:58,261
We still should watch that Nira Gippus.

135
00:16:58,405 --> 00:17:01,616
She may be a novice but the Emperor knows
what potential lies within her.

136
00:17:05,906 --> 00:17:08,312
Here they come, our watchdogs.

137
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:11,544
Very well then, a tech priest.

138
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:14,066
Iíve never trusted those guys.

139
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,718
If one can call them human at all.

140
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:19,970
They do not really believe in the Emperor.

141
00:17:21,387 --> 00:17:23,995
Hey!
He seems to be done, finally.

142
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:30,966
The rites of awakening are finished.

143
00:17:31,254 --> 00:17:36,453
The elevator will
take us safely to depth 63.

144
00:18:12,576 --> 00:18:13,807
Halt!

145
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:58,290
Adeodatus ...

146
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:00,733
I guess you donít have any

147
00:19:00,787 --> 00:19:04,796
information regarding
this Ñforbidden meetingì,

148
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:08,691
as I happen to know the
inner workings of the Inquisition.

149
00:19:08,935 --> 00:19:12,977
Considering the military prowess
of this penal squad

150
00:19:13,294 --> 00:19:17,388
they can be nothing but
poorly equipped insurgents.

151
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:20,944
Do not underestimate us, soldier boy.

152
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:24,920
If you even had the faintest idea
what we have already seen!

153
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:27,960
Donít underestimate the Inquisition.

154
00:19:29,254 --> 00:19:31,523
It is my duty to inform you

155
00:19:31,615 --> 00:19:36,211
that I will record any blasphemous
and heretical actions and statements!

156
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:39,805
I hope you know that, von Remus.

157
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:43,460
Quite plain.

158
00:19:43,844 --> 00:19:49,179
Come on, letís smoke
this lair of heretics out.

159
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,556
Left flank, Wodan.

160
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,685
Room secured.

161
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,831
Gas and radiation values
are within acceptable ranges.

162
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:12,917
Very good. Weíll advance
to the next possible descent location.

163
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,438
Oktavian, conduct a deep scan
every 10 minutes.

164
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:18,485
The laws of the Administratum
do not reach this place

165
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:21,129
and I donít want any surprises!

166
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:03,376
They are only armed with light weapons.

167
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:07,955
Three additional signs
right in room behind that door.

168
00:22:08,387 --> 00:22:12,515
No surveillance sensors
within the perimeter.

169
00:22:13,486 --> 00:22:17,353
I cannot access further sectors.

170
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:18,864
Good to know.

171
00:22:19,557 --> 00:22:25,768
Must be the walls of the Manufactorum.
Probably.

172
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,998
Adeodatus. Reporting in.

173
00:22:36,181 --> 00:22:38,797
Command HQ? Can you hear me?

174
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:43,979
Adeodatus for command HQ.

175
00:22:44,016 --> 00:22:45,928
Can anyone hear me!?

176
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:19,771
Adept Oktavian?

177
00:23:20,451 --> 00:23:22,439
Do you feel it, too?

178
00:23:22,621 --> 00:23:27,055
I do not feel, psyker.

179
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:29,050
I see.

180
00:23:29,113 --> 00:23:34,828
But the eye of the Machine God is...
embittered down here.

181
00:23:35,824 --> 00:23:39,116
Thatís not a good omen ...

182
00:23:39,903 --> 00:23:42,683
And where are the others by the way?

183
00:23:45,046 --> 00:23:46,802
Whatís that supposed to be!?

184
00:23:46,962 --> 00:23:49,166
They were meant to wait!

185
00:23:55,924 --> 00:23:59,339
Stop right there! What in the name of
the only true one is your business here?

186
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:02,372
Because of the only true one
amongst true ones I have come here.

187
00:24:03,365 --> 00:24:05,298
I am searching for my property.

188
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:07,961
One of my working slaves has escaped.

189
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:11,256
Youríre in the wrong place here.
We havenít seen anybody.

190
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:13,952
Thatís odd ...

191
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:16,921
I was absolutely sure that
he ran in this direction.

192
00:24:20,046 --> 00:24:24,375
But you probably would have seen him
if you hadnít been so easily distracted.

193
00:24:28,489 --> 00:24:30,893
Interesting approach ...

194
00:24:41,797 --> 00:24:44,387
Letís hurry up.
There may be more of them near.

195
00:24:44,596 --> 00:24:47,348
Oktavian, keep an eye on the vicinity.

196
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,792
I guess we gathered enough
information for the Inquisition.

197
00:25:05,483 --> 00:25:07,175
Letís get out of here as soon as possible.

198
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,213
Yeah, exactly!

199
00:25:08,313 --> 00:25:11,593
Our orders are clear, von Remus.

200
00:25:11,728 --> 00:25:15,398
'Cleanse and purge' -
we already bumped off five of them!

201
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:19,493
Yeah, even without knowing
if they actually posed a threat to us.

202
00:25:27,012 --> 00:25:28,203
I knew it!

203
00:25:28,383 --> 00:25:29,368
What?

204
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:31,828
Thereís a strange symbol on their cowls.

205
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:35,886
That confirms our suspicion about
this being a forbidden organisation.

206
00:25:36,177 --> 00:25:38,801
We have to get deeper into the complex,

207
00:25:38,949 --> 00:25:41,408
collect more pieces of evidence
for the Inquisition.

208
00:25:44,817 --> 00:25:46,593
Oktavian?

209
00:25:46,577 --> 00:25:48,268
Anything wrong?

210
00:25:48,584 --> 00:25:54,663
Interferences ...
Strange interferences ...

211
00:25:59,082 --> 00:26:01,301
There is... no...

212
00:26:01,401 --> 00:26:03,156
someone was there!

213
00:26:04,138 --> 00:26:05,678
After him!

214
00:26:08,643 --> 00:26:10,687
Great ...

215
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:45,391
He is moving towards
a big maintenance hall.

216
00:27:48,365 --> 00:27:50,693
Makkabeus sends me.

217
00:27:50,828 --> 00:27:52,935
The preparations have begun.

218
00:27:53,092 --> 00:27:55,935
He wants to talk to you before it starts.

219
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:57,999
I will be there.

220
00:28:15,012 --> 00:28:17,124
What is it?

221
00:28:25,302 --> 00:28:27,163
I guess we have seen enough, soldier.

222
00:28:27,263 --> 00:28:30,164
You can earn your badges
in another suicide mission.

223
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:32,153
We follow orders, von Remus.

224
00:28:32,325 --> 00:28:35,387
We donít retreat until
we know what is wrong here.

225
00:28:36,068 --> 00:28:38,748
I somehow have the feeling,
someone in here had...

226
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:40,879
deeper insights into certain files, eh?

227
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,610
Be quiet! I think I heard something.

228
00:28:44,754 --> 00:28:46,004
Oktavian?

229
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:47,929
Very weak.

230
00:28:48,134 --> 00:28:49,407
Iím on him.

231
00:28:50,776 --> 00:28:51,885
Nira?

232
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,473
Where's Nira?

233
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,868
A psychic shockwave!

234
00:29:07,054 --> 00:29:08,663
Weíd better hurry up.

235
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:47,693
Nira?

236
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:04,206
Iím sorry!

237
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,308
I didnít mean to do that!

238
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:10,043
Never do that again!

239
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,443
What happened?

240
00:30:19,981 --> 00:30:23,076
May the Emperor be with us.

241
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:35,720
I...

242
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,512
felt dizzy.

243
00:30:38,627 --> 00:30:40,224
And then...

244
00:30:40,524 --> 00:30:42,628
he was suddenly there.

245
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,978
Signa accipio.

246
00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:50,082
Approaching.

247
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,437
- Damn, cultists!
- Charge!

248
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:22,894
Retreat to the hall!

249
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:24,614
Back into the hall!

250
00:31:25,573 --> 00:31:26,818
Go! Go!

251
00:31:29,702 --> 00:31:31,231
Get them!

252
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,397
Go in and win!

253
00:32:19,394 --> 00:32:20,738
Nira! Watch out,
he's on your back!

254
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,562
Damnatus... est!

255
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,396
I cannot see you anymore...

256
00:33:10,336 --> 00:33:12,490
Maschine empathy.

257
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:35,925
Finish them!

258
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,342
Heavy weapon, 12 o'clock!

259
00:35:28,196 --> 00:35:29,964
That won't hold them back for long.

260
00:35:30,491 --> 00:35:31,684
Let's go!

261
00:35:39,383 --> 00:35:42,117
Oktavian. Is this the way that
will get us out of here the quickest?

262
00:35:42,217 --> 00:35:46,262
It is the one with
the least enemy activities.

263
00:35:50,292 --> 00:35:51,294
Wodan,...

264
00:35:52,302 --> 00:35:54,108
if we ever survive that trip,

265
00:35:54,008 --> 00:35:57,461
please remind me to award
pleasant Mr. Adeodatus here

266
00:35:57,561 --> 00:35:59,489
with some permanent medals!

267
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,662
We need an exit, now!

268
00:36:18,258 --> 00:36:19,276
Watch out!

269
00:36:19,322 --> 00:36:20,390
Someoneís coming!

270
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,139
In the name of the Imperator,
hold your fire!

271
00:36:27,415 --> 00:36:29,785
The seal of the Inquisition.

272
00:36:33,938 --> 00:36:35,549
An operative.

273
00:36:36,593 --> 00:36:38,649
Things are getting better and better, eh?

274
00:36:38,753 --> 00:36:40,979
Youíre lucky I didnít
aim any higher or lower.

275
00:36:41,158 --> 00:36:43,326
Mhm, just a flesh wound ...

276
00:36:43,424 --> 00:36:44,489
Letís hurry,

277
00:36:44,585 --> 00:36:47,378
the door can only be opened from inside.

278
00:37:37,533 --> 00:37:39,693
Nobodyís here.

279
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:46,656
Good. We have to go back.

280
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:49,594
It will start soon.

281
00:37:58,698 --> 00:38:01,655
A lot of sectors are
not used by the conclave.

282
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:05,110
When I heard that you fled
to the north-eastern complex,

283
00:38:05,165 --> 00:38:08,057
I did all I could to hurry up to find you

284
00:38:08,132 --> 00:38:09,593
before they did.

285
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,065
Conclave?

286
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,284
What kind of people are we talking about?

287
00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:15,978
You donít know that?

288
00:38:16,131 --> 00:38:17,619
No, not really.

289
00:38:18,524 --> 00:38:22,059
Strange, this is not the common procedure
with missions of this importance.

290
00:38:22,697 --> 00:38:26,055
Well, I am sorry for your losses.

291
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:29,342
Unfortunately I lost contact with command.

292
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,640
Otherwise I would have
guided you to a secret entrance.

293
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,007
Thereís no need to feel bad.

294
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:39,250
We didnít lose anybody.

295
00:38:39,931 --> 00:38:42,287
Inquisitor Lessus didnít send more?

296
00:38:42,506 --> 00:38:43,690
No.

297
00:38:43,797 --> 00:38:47,066
Damn you, what is this all about!?

298
00:38:47,131 --> 00:38:49,443
One moment. We are almost there.

299
00:38:49,543 --> 00:38:52,585
I got myself access to
stratetically important points

300
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,731
and was able to establish
a secret hideout here.

301
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,559
Not quite comfortable,

302
00:39:03,745 --> 00:39:07,390
but better than to be in the
same room with these heretics.

303
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:09,094
Do you have any dressing material?

304
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:10,978
Thereís no need for that.

305
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,321
I will personally take care of it later.

306
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,142
Do you have a name or...

307
00:39:19,277 --> 00:39:21,075
is that top secret, too?

308
00:39:21,355 --> 00:39:23,647
Alias: Lechias

309
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:25,647
Well, Lechias...

310
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:27,590
Why donít you tell us why weíre here.

311
00:39:27,695 --> 00:39:31,079
Or even better:
What do you think why weíre here.

312
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:36,169
You were hired to prevent
an unholy ceremony being held

313
00:39:36,452 --> 00:39:39,392
threatening the planet and maybe

314
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,867
even the whole system.

315
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,771
Witch scum then!

316
00:39:43,939 --> 00:39:46,795
I knew it, I knew it all along!

317
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,572
Not a common sorcerer ...

318
00:39:51,247 --> 00:39:57,242
The so called 'Conclave of Ninity'
is led by Zyriakus Makkabeus,

319
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:02,795
a traitor, on whose trail
we have been for decades.

320
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,648
He must be stopped

321
00:40:04,783 --> 00:40:08,823
before he is able to put
his insane plan into action.

322
00:40:08,942 --> 00:40:10,689
What are his exact plans?

323
00:40:11,263 --> 00:40:15,514
Ignorance is a value
that has to be protected.

324
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:20,114
There may be a reason why you did not get

325
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,685
every piece of information, mercenaries ...

326
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,694
Sure thing.

327
00:40:24,825 --> 00:40:28,237
Otherwise we wouldnít have
gotten stuck with that crap here!

328
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:29,728
Itís an...

329
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,987
Invocatio Daemonis, isn't it?

330
00:40:33,716 --> 00:40:36,731
You could put it that way, but...

331
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,943
beware your words and thoughts.

332
00:40:40,267 --> 00:40:45,470
We do not want to lure such...
dark creatures.

333
00:40:46,118 --> 00:40:50,205
For months I have had to
fight off this foul spawn

334
00:40:50,321 --> 00:40:52,925
that is spread widely everywhere down here.

335
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:58,315
Only too well I know
about these nameless things.

336
00:40:59,511 --> 00:41:01,084
Anyway.

337
00:41:01,497 --> 00:41:03,070
I infiltrated this place

338
00:41:03,142 --> 00:41:07,386
to gather information about
the scheming of this Makkabeus.

339
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,498
But then I lost contact with the HQ

340
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:14,610
and I could only send few data.

341
00:41:14,757 --> 00:41:17,940
Probably the assigned Inquisitor
doesnít know anything about this situation.

342
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,965
That would explain
why we were sent down here.

343
00:41:20,577 --> 00:41:23,552
Weíre definitely
the wrong guys for that mission.

344
00:41:23,753 --> 00:41:26,495
Let the Inquisition send their specialists!

345
00:41:26,983 --> 00:41:28,266
Yeah, right!

346
00:41:28,372 --> 00:41:31,654
Or even the warriors of the Adeptus Astartes!

347
00:41:32,473 --> 00:41:34,442
Time is ticking though!

348
00:41:34,741 --> 00:41:39,589
A fortunate planetary configuration
is in to happen as I have got to know.

349
00:41:39,617 --> 00:41:42,782
Pardon!? Does that mean
itís all about to start any second

350
00:41:42,871 --> 00:41:44,826
and weíre in midst of this crap!?

351
00:41:44,929 --> 00:41:46,553
What shall we do?

352
00:41:47,014 --> 00:41:50,623
If it is about eliminating the traitor
whose name I do not want to repeat,

353
00:41:50,713 --> 00:41:53,775
I will volunteer for the mission.

354
00:41:53,992 --> 00:41:56,864
Nira and myself are
sufficiently armed for this mission.

355
00:41:57,567 --> 00:41:58,704
I see,

356
00:41:59,064 --> 00:42:02,243
milksop here would like
to be the hero, yes?

357
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:06,082
Confess, you knew that all the time!

358
00:42:07,345 --> 00:42:10,305
Thatís a stitch-up!
Youíre all in cahoots with each other!

359
00:42:10,414 --> 00:42:11,715
Didnít you listen to him?

360
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:13,305
It's about Sancta Heroica,

361
00:42:13,352 --> 00:42:15,020
my home!

362
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,977
What use would the Inquisition have of

363
00:42:17,025 --> 00:42:20,840
assigning a bunch of dirty mercenaries
to such an important operation?

364
00:42:21,551 --> 00:42:25,643
But weíre perhaps only
supposed to be a diversion!

365
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,450
Personally I donít feel
the urge to sacrifice myself

366
00:42:28,508 --> 00:42:31,315
for this city or anything else

367
00:42:31,557 --> 00:42:32,744
on this ugly world.

368
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:35,369
Lower your weapon, Sergeant.

369
00:42:38,988 --> 00:42:41,864
There is no alternative as it seems.

370
00:42:41,973 --> 00:42:44,547
In this universe one is sacrificed

371
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,427
or sacrifices himself.

372
00:42:52,978 --> 00:42:55,849
We could definitely use
some reinforcements.

373
00:42:56,795 --> 00:42:58,366
Right,...

374
00:42:58,467 --> 00:43:02,651
why donít you just
inform your superior, Adeodatus?

375
00:43:02,722 --> 00:43:04,504
- I...
- His secret uplink

376
00:43:04,604 --> 00:43:06,093
has no connection

377
00:43:06,193 --> 00:43:09,638
since we entered depth 69.

378
00:43:09,738 --> 00:43:13,910
Thatís right. I canít send
any Vid-Log messages since then.

379
00:43:14,557 --> 00:43:17,086
The conclave knows well
how to hide themselves.

380
00:43:17,442 --> 00:43:20,161
But we have that skill as well.

381
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:25,677
I know a secret passage
beneath the old manufactorum

382
00:43:25,713 --> 00:43:29,544
leading directly to the
inner chambers of the conclaveís lair.

383
00:43:29,718 --> 00:43:33,810
There your will find
the heads of this heretic hydra.

384
00:43:34,037 --> 00:43:36,115
You wonít come with us?

385
00:43:36,328 --> 00:43:40,215
An Imperial operative
with your experience, your skills,

386
00:43:40,382 --> 00:43:42,423
could be very helpful with this.

387
00:43:42,818 --> 00:43:47,301
My strength lies in infiltration,
not in combat.

388
00:43:48,067 --> 00:43:50,349
My skills are rather...

389
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,629
unusual.

390
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,307
This is not my body.

391
00:43:55,452 --> 00:43:59,820
It is the body of
rich merchant Reuel Eisenstein,

392
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:04,987
an influential supporter of the conclave.

393
00:44:05,074 --> 00:44:08,406
He could move rather
freely amongst the heretics.

394
00:44:08,428 --> 00:44:11,349
Spys, altering their shape ...

395
00:44:11,459 --> 00:44:16,130
I have heard of rumours that the Inquisition
had such operatives at its disposal.

396
00:44:17,233 --> 00:44:20,175
Enough! Letís go.

397
00:44:20,964 --> 00:44:25,679
I anyway have to go back soon.
Otherwise they would get suspicious.

398
00:44:38,757 --> 00:44:43,136
And under no circumstance
leave the way I showed you!

399
00:44:43,204 --> 00:44:46,156
Donít worry, Oktavian
has already stored the way.

400
00:44:46,412 --> 00:44:47,691
Very well.

401
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:51,583
Voluntas imperatoris perficiatur.

402
00:45:45,837 --> 00:45:48,629
What used to be manufactured
here, by the way?

403
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:52,939
Everything the Imperium
needs for its defence.

404
00:45:53,128 --> 00:45:55,068
Tanks, weapons, ammunition.

405
00:45:55,135 --> 00:45:57,803
Why then was this manufactorum shut down?

406
00:45:58,091 --> 00:46:00,346
Nobody knows that exactly nowadays.

407
00:46:00,962 --> 00:46:05,905
There are many rumours of how it is
connected to the great plague centuries ago.

408
00:46:05,937 --> 00:46:11,488
But there are many old wivesí tales
about this old section of the hive anyway.

409
00:46:16,498 --> 00:46:19,454
What a waste ...

410
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:25,206
I will send a prayer
to the Omissiah for forgiveness..

411
00:47:16,906 --> 00:47:18,396
Nira!
Whatís wrong?

412
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,195
It's... itís alright.

413
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:26,077
She suddenly collapsed.

414
00:47:28,281 --> 00:47:31,076
Donít worry. One gets used to it.

415
00:47:31,155 --> 00:47:32,816
We have to move on.

416
00:47:33,495 --> 00:47:35,363
They... they screamed.

417
00:47:35,301 --> 00:47:36,823
Screaming? Who was screaming?

418
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:38,847
I donít know.

419
00:47:39,435 --> 00:47:42,222
Many of them... many.

420
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:46,193
But when you came,...

421
00:47:46,433 --> 00:47:48,109
they fell silent.

422
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:50,741
Youíre not trying
to come on to me, are you?

423
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,204
No!

424
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,063
I took a vow.

425
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:58,595
Do not pollute my thoughts.

426
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:05,123
But it is like you were surrounded
by an aura of calmness ...

427
00:48:10,518 --> 00:48:12,836
It keeps bad spirits away.

428
00:48:13,192 --> 00:48:16,184
A foreign race gave it to me
after rescuing me.

429
00:48:16,277 --> 00:48:18,332
Evil xenos tricks!?

430
00:48:18,456 --> 00:48:20,487
If you like to call it that way.

431
00:48:22,339 --> 00:48:24,587
I can feel it protecting me, but...

432
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:25,918
Iím willing to lend it to you

433
00:48:25,978 --> 00:48:29,997
if it helps you to focus
your thoughts on our mission.

434
00:48:31,336 --> 00:48:32,889
It is wonderful.

435
00:48:32,975 --> 00:48:35,669
Still, keep it hidden.

436
00:48:37,172 --> 00:48:39,688
What's keeping you groxes?

437
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:25,593
Whatís wrong?

438
00:49:27,109 --> 00:49:29,561
Listen.

439
00:49:43,014 --> 00:49:45,210
Which way now?

440
00:50:18,841 --> 00:50:21,209
That is the way.

441
00:50:23,885 --> 00:50:28,276
So we now hand over
our fate to a playing card.

442
00:50:28,503 --> 00:50:31,927
Like some inquisitors, too.

443
00:50:54,949 --> 00:50:58,623
You wanted to talk to me,
Inquisitor Makkabaeus?

444
00:50:58,816 --> 00:51:01,230
Yes, honoured Eisenstein.

445
00:51:01,518 --> 00:51:04,914
I hope my two guards did not disturb thou.

446
00:51:05,258 --> 00:51:08,293
But after that strange raid -

447
00:51:08,825 --> 00:51:12,429
During which thou as well hast been
wounded, as I can see -

448
00:51:13,581 --> 00:51:16,840
we are forced to act more cautiously.

449
00:51:18,184 --> 00:51:21,110
Those intruders ...

450
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:24,798
They could be a vanguard!

451
00:51:25,284 --> 00:51:30,941
Perhaps the puritans among my order
are already breathing down my neck.

452
00:51:31,317 --> 00:51:35,396
They rather came across me like...
a bunch of...

453
00:51:35,684 --> 00:51:37,429
shabby archeotech raiders.

454
00:51:37,531 --> 00:51:39,767
Yes, that may be.

455
00:51:40,511 --> 00:51:44,658
But thou shalt never trust
the outer appearance ...

456
00:52:03,405 --> 00:52:08,264
As I see, you already ordered the staff
being taken out of the stasis chamber.

457
00:52:09,641 --> 00:52:12,907
I thought this should only happen
when the time has come?

458
00:52:12,959 --> 00:52:18,167
I only had it brought
into my chamber to study it.

459
00:52:18,814 --> 00:52:23,301
Do not worry. The splinter essence inside
will not fade that soon.

460
00:52:23,676 --> 00:52:24,866
Far from it.

461
00:52:24,969 --> 00:52:27,405
It is alive, very alive.

462
00:52:27,578 --> 00:52:30,837
Please... be careful with it.

463
00:52:31,696 --> 00:52:34,464
I spent my entire wealth

464
00:52:34,504 --> 00:52:38,755
for this precious staff
being taken to Sancta Heroica.

465
00:52:41,394 --> 00:52:44,163
All our hardship

466
00:52:44,672 --> 00:52:49,745
will be remunerated with the undying
blessing of the Emperor, my friend.

467
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:50,913
Soon,

468
00:52:51,219 --> 00:52:54,096
we will begin.

469
00:52:55,303 --> 00:53:01,396
The stars are on the exact
same coordinates as...

470
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:05,817
1000 years ago when Bíewesh Gíguor -

471
00:53:06,297 --> 00:53:08,801
his false name shall be damned -

472
00:53:09,425 --> 00:53:12,897
spread his foul wings above this planet.

473
00:53:13,036 --> 00:53:17,748
Today, we will bring him
down once and for all.

474
00:53:17,962 --> 00:53:21,906
We will force him into
the righteous chains of faith.

475
00:53:22,411 --> 00:53:27,716
And we will use his power
against his rotten kind.

476
00:53:28,515 --> 00:53:30,605
His breed will burn!

477
00:53:30,704 --> 00:53:32,069
And his retinue

478
00:53:32,187 --> 00:53:35,428
will be erased from the face of

479
00:53:35,664 --> 00:53:37,057
the universe!

480
00:53:37,792 --> 00:53:41,015
Upon my name Makkabaeus.

481
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:46,142
Sic fiat et non aliter.

482
00:53:46,442 --> 00:53:47,488
Yes.

483
00:53:47,921 --> 00:53:50,905
Yeess, it shall come.

484
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,389
Now, make thy way as soon as possible
to one of the protection chambers.

485
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:03,299
And place a personal
purity seal upon the door.

486
00:54:06,051 --> 00:54:10,474
During the ceremony huge amounts
of psychic energies will be released.

487
00:54:10,591 --> 00:54:12,366
It may come to pass

488
00:54:13,085 --> 00:54:17,244
that unasked creatures
of the warp may haunt us.

489
00:54:17,376 --> 00:54:20,065
Prepare thyself for that.

490
00:54:21,646 --> 00:54:23,596
In a few hours everything will be over,

491
00:54:23,777 --> 00:54:27,548
and then we will be able
to continue our research.

492
00:54:38,253 --> 00:54:42,044
Eisenstein, thou shalt
lay thyself to rest anyway.

493
00:54:42,605 --> 00:54:44,764
Thou look weakened.

494
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:47,717
The wound?

495
00:54:48,581 --> 00:54:50,511
Yees, ...

496
00:54:50,776 --> 00:54:53,099
it seems like that.

497
00:54:54,606 --> 00:54:57,259
Then set out.

498
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,693
I will personally

499
00:55:03,952 --> 00:55:07,020
commit a deed that wilst

500
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,370
go down in the annals

501
00:55:10,531 --> 00:55:13,751
of the Imperium!

502
00:55:20,548 --> 00:55:23,723
I donít get it! We even have
to crawl through this soup here!

503
00:55:24,217 --> 00:55:26,603
Und da vorn wird
das ganze auch noch tiefer.

504
00:55:26,994 --> 00:55:29,628
Hope your sensors are right, Oktavian.

505
00:55:30,131 --> 00:55:33,192
There is nothing
beneath this dirty broth!

506
00:55:33,636 --> 00:55:37,131
Rats, Dubro, just rats ...

507
00:55:37,871 --> 00:55:40,850
I just feel like having a ratburger now.

508
00:55:40,997 --> 00:55:43,690
Do you remember the times
on Necromunda, Corris?

509
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:46,133
Those were the best ones!

510
00:55:46,938 --> 00:55:49,372
There the sewer was
the most contaminated place.

511
00:55:49,514 --> 00:55:52,328
Yeah! Those were real rats!

512
00:56:10,664 --> 00:56:12,411
Itís ok.

513
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:14,427
Just a dizzy spell ...

514
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:17,515
Take me to my chambers.

515
00:56:19,982 --> 00:56:22,393
I have to attend to
some personal affairs.

516
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,196
But...

517
00:56:24,231 --> 00:56:25,610
Thereís no but!

518
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:28,472
I will follow you to the shelter, soon.

519
00:56:28,561 --> 00:56:30,457
I will make it.

520
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,767
One thing is bothering me, soldier ...

521
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,999
And that would be?

522
00:56:36,153 --> 00:56:39,522
If that is supposed to
be depth 69 above us,

523
00:56:39,637 --> 00:56:42,057
where the Horus are we now?

524
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:44,483
Weíre still in depth 69.

525
00:56:44,631 --> 00:56:48,611
But maybe the manufactorum
sunk because of hive quakes.

526
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:52,803
My hive has exactly
191 heights and 69 depths.

527
00:56:53,048 --> 00:56:55,059
Remember that, merc.

528
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:22,465
All be quiet.

529
00:57:45,104 --> 00:57:48,627
A... warp storm... approaches. 

530
00:57:48,814 --> 00:57:51,280
Weíd better hurry up.

531
00:58:06,478 --> 00:58:07,968
What...

532
00:58:08,827 --> 00:58:11,807
What is happening... to me?

533
00:58:35,999 --> 00:58:39,670
It is exceptionally quiet in here ...

534
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:42,066
That must be the realm
of the inner circle.

535
00:58:42,121 --> 00:58:44,317
Be alert, it cannot be far.

536
00:58:44,381 --> 00:58:47,021
Letís bring this to an end!

537
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:59,138
Seem as if they were
less fortunate than we were.

538
00:59:59,593 --> 01:00:01,001
Come on, onwards.

539
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:55,091
<i>(Summoning formula)</i>

540
01:01:54,754 --> 01:01:57,374
Strange things are happening here.

541
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:59,813
This summoning is not

542
01:01:59,945 --> 01:02:02,368
what it seems to be ...

543
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,138
Kill them!

544
01:02:46,293 --> 01:02:47,118
Kill them quickly!

545
01:02:47,525 --> 01:02:48,798
We must go on.

546
01:03:37,011 --> 01:03:38,427
Well done, Nira ...

547
01:03:39,657 --> 01:03:41,527
Keep them at bay!

548
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:52,747
In the name of the damned Inquisition,

549
01:03:53,168 --> 01:03:56,418
I hereby adjourn this meeting!

550
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:57,898
You shall not...

551
01:03:58,131 --> 01:04:00,285
interrupt us now ...

552
01:04:00,354 --> 01:04:01,633
Not now!

553
01:04:04,613 --> 01:04:06,053
Die,

554
01:04:06,196 --> 01:04:07,336
heretic!

555
01:04:07,436 --> 01:04:08,905
Nooo!

556
01:04:54,942 --> 01:04:57,894
You misguided...

557
01:04:57,926 --> 01:05:00,170
you fools!

558
01:06:28,865 --> 01:06:32,182
If this was not what it looked like, ...

559
01:06:33,134 --> 01:06:34,698
what was it?

560
01:06:36,496 --> 01:06:38,124
Nira?

561
01:06:38,215 --> 01:06:40,385
I... I donít know ...

562
01:06:40,957 --> 01:06:43,244
You could be right.

563
01:06:43,361 --> 01:06:47,170
Wodan saw an inquisitorial rosette
pinned on Makkabaeusí cowl

564
01:06:47,435 --> 01:06:49,806
shortly before he burnt the corpse.

565
01:06:49,931 --> 01:06:51,923
Those were no followers of Chaos,

566
01:06:52,054 --> 01:06:53,678
at least no common ones.

567
01:06:55,569 --> 01:06:58,696
I donít know what we blundered into

568
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,732
and I donít feel the need to know it.

569
01:07:00,988 --> 01:07:02,592
But when we reach the surface

570
01:07:02,658 --> 01:07:06,136
weíll take the first available transport off
this planet and get the hell out of here.

571
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:08,232
We could take you with us, Nira.

572
01:07:11,086 --> 01:07:13,478
... as we will have an esplanade soon.

573
01:07:25,727 --> 01:07:28,217
I will hand over
your engrams to your brothers

574
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:32,649
having them brought to Mars and
laid down within the machine godís temple,

575
01:07:32,761 --> 01:07:35,184
as you told me to.

576
01:07:36,835 --> 01:07:38,331
We have to go now,

577
01:07:38,501 --> 01:07:39,634
old friend,

578
01:07:40,228 --> 01:07:41,827
we have to go now.

579
01:07:53,009 --> 01:07:55,220
Omnissias te per

580
01:07:55,436 --> 01:07:58,579
tenebras ducebit.

581
01:08:58,766 --> 01:09:00,119
Hurry.

582
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:03,235
The same way before it is blocked.

583
01:09:06,115 --> 01:09:09,038
I donít give a damn
what happened to patrol 9.

584
01:09:09,642 --> 01:09:12,163
Hold your positions!

585
01:09:12,525 --> 01:09:15,569
Too late ...

586
01:09:39,415 --> 01:09:41,276
Flesh...

587
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:43,090
it is so weak...

588
01:09:43,143 --> 01:09:44,367
so...

589
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:45,601
weak.

590
01:09:57,059 --> 01:09:59,846
Stay here, cowardly grots!

591
01:10:00,691 --> 01:10:01,909
Go go! Allís clear.

592
01:10:41,528 --> 01:10:43,700
Do you this taste, too?

593
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:46,312
Tastes like metal or something.

594
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:47,775
Whereís Osmar got to?

595
01:10:52,291 --> 01:10:53,502
Oh...

596
01:10:53,843 --> 01:10:57,447
The brave soldier is injured
and doesnít want to show it.

597
01:10:58,645 --> 01:11:00,239
Iíll pick him up ...

598
01:11:15,674 --> 01:11:17,253
What is that!?

599
01:11:30,607 --> 01:11:32,863
Why didnít you warn us?
Whatís wrong with you, Nira?

600
01:11:32,962 --> 01:11:34,179
You did feel it!

601
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:36,781
Yes, there... there was something.
In the door.

602
01:11:36,816 --> 01:11:38,887
But it is not only in the door.

603
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:41,193
It is everwhere!

604
01:11:45,582 --> 01:11:47,477
Itís no use!

605
01:11:47,684 --> 01:11:48,722
Itís growing again!

606
01:11:48,877 --> 01:11:51,509
Go on! Weíll find another exit!

607
01:12:05,032 --> 01:12:07,357
Come on, soldier.

608
01:12:25,783 --> 01:12:28,924
Silence, my brothers!

609
01:12:29,037 --> 01:12:31,244
Silence!

610
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:34,348
Yes.

611
01:12:34,703 --> 01:12:37,491
The ceremony has been interrupted.

612
01:12:38,047 --> 01:12:39,999
You know

613
01:12:40,787 --> 01:12:45,665
what to do, brothers.

614
01:12:58,803 --> 01:13:00,294
Do you think...

615
01:13:00,461 --> 01:13:02,849
theyíll make it on their own?

616
01:13:04,554 --> 01:13:06,350
Corris is a tough one to break.

617
01:13:06,502 --> 01:13:07,837
Heíll make it.

618
01:13:09,117 --> 01:13:11,240
Iím not sure if we came down that way ...

619
01:13:12,022 --> 01:13:14,388
Come on. We have to stay together.

620
01:13:20,452 --> 01:13:22,668
Do you by any chance happen
to know where the exit is?

621
01:13:22,753 --> 01:13:24,101
Of course...

622
01:13:24,558 --> 01:13:27,118
Thereís where all those friendly
guys with the masks come from.

623
01:13:27,339 --> 01:13:28,723
Thatís a way out of here.

624
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,681
Wait here.

625
01:13:34,347 --> 01:13:35,626
Damn!

626
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:36,672
Speak of the enemy.

627
01:13:36,752 --> 01:13:39,194
- How many?
- Too many for the two of us.

628
01:13:39,954 --> 01:13:41,640
Do you see the stairs over there?

629
01:13:41,976 --> 01:13:42,930
Yeah.

630
01:13:43,392 --> 01:13:45,515
If we move fast, weíll make it.

631
01:13:45,897 --> 01:13:47,527
- Iíll watch your back.
- Good.

632
01:13:48,619 --> 01:13:49,570
Go!

633
01:13:52,015 --> 01:13:53,065
There the killers!

634
01:13:53,121 --> 01:13:54,221
Judge them!

635
01:14:08,944 --> 01:14:10,752
Go down the stairs, quickly!

636
01:14:14,339 --> 01:14:16,406
Come on, come on ...

637
01:14:21,649 --> 01:14:22,507
Damn.

638
01:14:22,997 --> 01:14:24,887
Take cover!

639
01:14:51,979 --> 01:14:53,327
Whatís wrong, Wodan?

640
01:14:53,561 --> 01:14:54,886
Look at that.

641
01:15:01,527 --> 01:15:03,221
Seventy-one.

642
01:15:03,713 --> 01:15:07,664
This hive seems to have
more depths than people know.

643
01:15:07,801 --> 01:15:09,459
We got lost in any way.

644
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:12,788
These markings doesnít
help us on neither.

645
01:15:14,012 --> 01:15:15,423
Come on.

646
01:15:39,023 --> 01:15:41,819
Fortunately the whole
ceiling didnít come down.

647
01:15:42,498 --> 01:15:44,778
Thatíll buy us time.

648
01:15:47,905 --> 01:15:49,153
Come on.

649
01:15:57,330 --> 01:15:59,414
Good.
Good, good, good.

650
01:16:01,038 --> 01:16:01,904
Are you alright?

651
01:16:01,956 --> 01:16:04,053
I'm fine, I'm fine ...

652
01:16:04,337 --> 01:16:06,983
Okay,...
which way?

653
01:16:07,851 --> 01:16:09,148
Which way ...

654
01:16:10,092 --> 01:16:11,291
Donít panic ...

655
01:16:11,595 --> 01:16:12,915
Just donít panic.

656
01:16:18,418 --> 01:16:19,618
What in the name... !?

657
01:16:30,325 --> 01:16:31,764
Which way?
Which corridor?

658
01:16:34,433 --> 01:16:37,478
What ...?

659
01:16:38,455 --> 01:16:39,879
This way.

660
01:16:39,975 --> 01:16:42,347
Come on.
We have to take this way.

661
01:16:49,547 --> 01:16:51,813
Looks like a market square ...

662
01:16:52,883 --> 01:16:55,340
or something like that.

663
01:16:58,039 --> 01:17:00,733
That is no market square.

664
01:17:22,898 --> 01:17:24,908
The plague that is said
to have raged down here,

665
01:17:24,924 --> 01:17:26,924
was a soul plague.

666
01:17:27,149 --> 01:17:29,916
The faithful versus the heretics
and the heretics versus the faithful.

667
01:17:30,756 --> 01:17:35,836
Thatís why they sealed the lowest depths
and sank them into oblivion.

668
01:17:37,834 --> 01:17:39,627
Letís keep moving.

669
01:17:39,777 --> 01:17:40,891
Please.

670
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:53,457
Well, Sergeant...

671
01:17:53,945 --> 01:17:56,816
Whatís the deal with your playing card?

672
01:18:01,393 --> 01:18:04,391
In the past, in my regiment,

673
01:18:04,699 --> 01:18:06,799
they called me 'Spade-Ace',

674
01:18:08,271 --> 01:18:10,360
because I always had it with me.

675
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:12,306
Itís my lucky charm,

676
01:18:12,397 --> 01:18:13,927
Adeodatus.

677
01:18:14,832 --> 01:18:17,150
Got me out of the slavery -

678
01:18:20,417 --> 01:18:22,072
this little playing card.

679
01:18:23,764 --> 01:18:27,968
My owner was drunken
when he raised his bet, and -

680
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:30,071
well -

681
01:18:30,694 --> 01:18:32,707
itís been a long time.

682
01:18:33,055 --> 01:18:36,674
Sometimes it feels like
two, three eternities.

683
01:18:38,084 --> 01:18:39,480
Well,...

684
01:18:39,937 --> 01:18:42,124
shortly after I

685
01:18:43,002 --> 01:18:45,224
entered active duty in the Imperial Guard.

686
01:18:50,124 --> 01:18:52,619
I was twelve back then.

687
01:18:55,327 --> 01:18:56,455
Those guys again!

688
01:18:59,959 --> 01:19:01,877
Run, Adeodatus - run!

689
01:19:15,443 --> 01:19:16,926
Hell, I like it.

690
01:19:17,065 --> 01:19:19,895
Praise Him on Terra!

691
01:19:32,229 --> 01:19:35,101
Looks like somebody was here recently.

692
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:37,526
The conclave actually
digged very deep as it seems.

693
01:19:37,796 --> 01:19:39,868
Either for research or for worshipping.

694
01:19:40,073 --> 01:19:41,844
Probably it was a bit of both.

695
01:19:43,174 --> 01:19:44,557
Hey, Hiero!

696
01:19:45,987 --> 01:19:47,566
I hear them again.

697
01:19:48,056 --> 01:19:49,280
The voices.

698
01:19:49,417 --> 01:19:51,253
So many.

699
01:19:53,415 --> 01:19:54,984
Your charm, it doesnít help!

700
01:19:55,366 --> 01:19:56,633
Wait, donít do that.

701
01:19:56,733 --> 01:19:58,736
Who knows what will happen if you drop it.

702
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:01,819
The air and the walls
weep of psychic energy,

703
01:20:01,919 --> 01:20:02,987
no need to be gifted to -

704
01:20:03,087 --> 01:20:06,508
It is not a gift - it is a curse!

705
01:20:07,275 --> 01:20:10,599
Hold on, Nira.
Weíll find a way out.

706
01:20:14,737 --> 01:20:16,681
Poor thing ...

707
01:20:20,694 --> 01:20:21,707
Damn!

708
01:20:21,853 --> 01:20:23,371
They have welded the door!

709
01:20:24,427 --> 01:20:26,066
Iíll go for reinforcements.

710
01:20:26,464 --> 01:20:28,356
They will be purged for their deed.

711
01:21:09,693 --> 01:21:11,440
Who are you?

712
01:21:18,013 --> 01:21:19,465
No...

713
01:21:21,453 --> 01:21:22,546
no...

714
01:21:22,657 --> 01:21:24,760
no, it canít be.

715
01:21:27,324 --> 01:21:28,943
Y-you cannot...

716
01:21:29,054 --> 01:21:31,244
Y-you just cannot have
found another host. 

717
01:21:31,305 --> 01:21:32,152
No!

718
01:21:32,506 --> 01:21:33,886
It canít be!

719
01:21:34,204 --> 01:21:35,052
No!

720
01:21:37,707 --> 01:21:40,389
We better blast our way
to the other direction.

721
01:21:40,641 --> 01:21:42,169
And better be fast!

722
01:21:47,476 --> 01:21:50,108
Thereís no use in praying Adeodatus.

723
01:21:56,810 --> 01:21:58,695
Actions are the prayers of a soldier

724
01:21:58,782 --> 01:22:01,875
and victories his offerings.

725
01:22:07,675 --> 01:22:09,804
Get in there!

726
01:22:18,873 --> 01:22:21,590
Letís hope thereís a way out
on the other side.

727
01:22:21,611 --> 01:22:23,067
Corris?

728
01:22:26,662 --> 01:22:28,321
Iím sorry.

729
01:22:28,978 --> 01:22:30,430
His orders.

730
01:22:31,214 --> 01:22:32,246
His orders!

731
01:23:55,534 --> 01:23:58,118
How far upwards do these
stairs actually lead?

732
01:23:58,528 --> 01:24:00,085
I hope far.

733
01:24:01,518 --> 01:24:04,372
The assembly tunnels to
the next depth could be sealed.

734
01:24:04,812 --> 01:24:06,211
But we will see.

735
01:24:17,044 --> 01:24:18,751
Wodan?

736
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:33,772
Hiero!

737
01:24:55,678 --> 01:24:57,130
Blasted rats.

738
01:25:05,898 --> 01:25:07,361
Wodan!

739
01:25:09,951 --> 01:25:11,195
Damn!

740
01:25:47,329 --> 01:25:51,497
<i>(Prayer)</i>

741
01:26:03,724 --> 01:26:05,620
You, too, will die!

742
01:26:06,032 --> 01:26:08,187
We all have to die.

743
01:26:08,391 --> 01:26:10,531
Some sooner!

744
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,967
Others later ...

745
01:26:14,171 --> 01:26:15,747
Ignorant!

746
01:26:15,911 --> 01:26:18,301
Iíd better die now for the cause

747
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:20,049
than later for HIM!

748
01:26:20,113 --> 01:26:21,593
Whatís that supposed to mean?!

749
01:26:21,909 --> 01:26:23,561
Speak, heretic!

750
01:26:24,814 --> 01:26:27,241
We have failed.

751
01:26:27,279 --> 01:26:31,168
HE is free again,
and HE thirsts...

752
01:27:07,572 --> 01:27:08,816
Where is he?

753
01:27:09,068 --> 01:27:10,257
I donít know.

754
01:27:10,447 --> 01:27:11,784
But I will find it out.

755
01:27:12,271 --> 01:27:13,600
Listen, Nira.

756
01:27:13,758 --> 01:27:16,432
You will pass that bridge,
take the stairs.

757
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:17,967
Youíll make it,

758
01:27:18,147 --> 01:27:19,283
you know that.

759
01:27:19,399 --> 01:27:21,822
Youíre stronger and more
powerful than anyone of us.

760
01:27:21,963 --> 01:27:23,062
But I cannot-

761
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:24,520
You have to!

762
01:27:29,425 --> 01:27:30,862
In this universe

763
01:27:30,992 --> 01:27:32,428
one will either be sacrified

764
01:27:33,067 --> 01:27:35,299
or sacrifice one-self.

765
01:27:44,017 --> 01:27:48,516
The truth is we canít even
chose the way we die on our own.

766
01:29:22,913 --> 01:29:25,147
You canít have gone far.

767
01:30:15,654 --> 01:30:17,230
No!

768
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:46,065
He couldn't bear themmm.

769
01:30:48,431 --> 01:30:53,232
The visions I showed him

770
01:30:53,428 --> 01:30:55,536
of my realmmm!

771
01:30:56,420 --> 01:30:57,592
Daemon!

772
01:31:10,996 --> 01:31:14,911
Thy weaponsss are worthlessss

773
01:31:14,998 --> 01:31:19,763
against the omnipotenccce of the change.

774
01:31:19,965 --> 01:31:24,902
My host has grown strong.

775
01:31:28,071 --> 01:31:29,548
Who... ?

776
01:31:30,113 --> 01:31:35,885
Ssso easy to manipulate ...

777
01:31:37,027 --> 01:31:40,030
We jussst have to follow you humansss

778
01:31:40,174 --> 01:31:46,658
to strengthen ourselvesss
at your sssoul fire.

779
01:31:48,805 --> 01:31:53,728
Your friends did entertain me for a while ...

780
01:31:55,888 --> 01:31:57,862
Lechias?

781
01:32:02,010 --> 01:32:05,070
Thou art the lassst one.

782
01:32:06,005 --> 01:32:11,473
Ssso she cannot be far.

783
01:32:12,812 --> 01:32:16,632
My plan did not foresssee you

784
01:32:17,197 --> 01:32:22,972
to shield her that well from me.

785
01:32:23,108 --> 01:32:26,607
Time isss running out.

786
01:32:28,545 --> 01:32:32,217
But this game isss

787
01:32:32,837 --> 01:32:35,139
over now!

788
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:29,415
<i>(Prayer)</i>

789
01:33:48,552 --> 01:33:54,370
Spare thy vigour, young Noviccce.

790
01:33:55,750 --> 01:34:02,945
Do not resist the fate I choossse for thou.

791
01:34:06,504 --> 01:34:08,051
Daemon!

792
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:11,295
Thou shalt not be here!

793
01:34:12,122 --> 01:34:14,338
I am here

794
01:34:14,678 --> 01:34:18,893
because this is my world!

795
01:34:19,757 --> 01:34:26,396
I came back to claim what once was mine!

796
01:34:27,906 --> 01:34:33,283
And now I shall end what I begun.

797
01:34:34,115 --> 01:34:35,999
Tremendous lies!

798
01:34:36,119 --> 01:34:40,298
Thou roam upon the soil
of the almighty Emperor.

799
01:34:40,444 --> 01:34:43,082
If I cannot stop thee,

800
01:34:43,222 --> 01:34:47,608
his legions will

801
01:34:47,926 --> 01:34:49,649
in his holy name!

802
01:35:04,014 --> 01:35:06,598
How right thou arrrt!

803
01:35:11,478 --> 01:35:17,726
Therefor I mussst open the gate to my realm.

804
01:35:18,249 --> 01:35:23,142
And for this I need thy power!

805
01:35:31,059 --> 01:35:35,116
Thou arrrt not alone ...

806
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:50,369
Now I sense you,

807
01:35:50,906 --> 01:35:54,169
old friend.

808
01:35:54,728 --> 01:35:58,449
Now I see thou.

809
01:36:00,629 --> 01:36:06,695
Even after I crushed thy body,

810
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:14,382
thy will tries to cross my plansss?

811
01:36:24,008 --> 01:36:28,486
Just as I frussstrated thine,

812
01:36:28,762 --> 01:36:32,622
Farseer Vintog Phaer?

813
01:36:33,887 --> 01:36:36,370
How ironic ...

814
01:37:09,794 --> 01:37:13,456
Unusual psy activities inside
the depths of Sancta Heroica.

815
01:37:22,931 --> 01:37:27,102
So this is where it will all begin again ...

816
01:37:29,003 --> 01:37:30,339
Transfer the coordinates!

817
01:37:35,788 --> 01:37:41,632
Right from the beginning
thou hast seen through my plans.

818
01:37:43,284 --> 01:37:48,831
Thou hast watched me choose my pieces.

819
01:37:50,210 --> 01:37:53,729
From the addicted changeling,

820
01:37:53,877 --> 01:37:57,220
to the megalomaniac hunter

821
01:37:58,452 --> 01:38:02,563
to the sleeping ssstorm of power.

822
01:38:05,232 --> 01:38:08,265
And now everything is over

823
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:13,905
as thou brought thy puny
being into the game.

824
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:28,892
So, this big is thy sacrifice.

825
01:38:31,008 --> 01:38:34,763
The Sphere Gate of Carmanshybed

826
01:38:35,439 --> 01:38:38,971
might be closssed eternally for me,

827
01:38:39,911 --> 01:38:43,442
but thy soul also

828
01:38:43,687 --> 01:38:46,666
is lost forever.

829
01:38:48,569 --> 01:38:51,930
Thou might have tricked me,

830
01:38:53,102 --> 01:38:57,599
but in the plans of the ever-changing

831
01:38:58,211 --> 01:39:02,487
defeats are not included.

832
01:39:15,647 --> 01:39:19,681
As only Chaosss

833
01:39:19,753 --> 01:39:22,986
is eternal!

834
01:42:04,983 --> 01:42:06,865
I predicted

835
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,092
that we wonít be too late.

836
01:42:13,279 --> 01:42:17,947
We are too late.

837
01:42:26,967 --> 01:42:28,726
It is said

838
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:32,754
that there are more daemons

839
01:42:33,642 --> 01:42:36,687
lurking in the dark

840
01:42:37,719 --> 01:42:41,143
Than there are stars shining in the sky.

841
01:42:44,077 --> 01:42:46,608
But there will be the day,

842
01:42:47,403 --> 01:42:49,706
the stars will stop

843
01:42:49,803 --> 01:42:53,385
existing.
