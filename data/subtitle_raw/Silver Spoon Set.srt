1
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,079
Even though it's been just a year,
it's already so difficult...

2
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,159
... to tell of that winter, of me...

3
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:28,639
... of all us Dauphins, which is the name
they have bestowed upon us in this town.

4
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,680
It's an ancient town, the kind of
which there are many in central Italy...

5
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,240
... where streets, buildings, the very walls...

6
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:39,519
... are imbued with stories,
with traditions, with the past...

7
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,879
Perhaps this is why here, everything
ends with a softened blow...

8
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,680
... a feeling of suffocation. It always seems
as though nothing has happened at all.

9
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:54,679
And we end up believing that, too.

10
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,680
But this is exactly why I've
started to write...

11
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:02,079
... to better understand myself, and how it was,
that in that passing of a season...

12
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:05,519
... we found ourselves changed, different...

13
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,560
Well? Are we going to the club?

14
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,119
- Yes, let's go to the club.
- Boring!

15
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,399
We'll go wherever you like, just as
long as you hurry up! I'm freezing.

16
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,400
- Let's go to Cherè's!
- I'm going in the same car as her.

17
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,120
To Cherè's! Everyone to Cherè's!

18
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,719
Well, this is where the story starts...

19
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,720
... on that November evening.
Or was it still October?

20
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:56,279
When Marina felt ill and Fedora
wasn't yet one of us...

21
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Indeed. She was one of the many girls
who used to stand and watch...

22
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,680
... when we would leave noisily
from the Café.

23
00:03:10,704 --> 00:03:14,947
THE DAUPHINS

24
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,439
Mother, why do you always have
to make yourself squint like that?

25
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,359
Oh, I wasn't even aware it was dark,
how about that?

26
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,360
- Plus, the new lodger...
- Uses too much electricity, I know.

27
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,840
And we need to save money, of course.

28
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,479
Marina! Marina!

29
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,959
Try to calm down.

30
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:10,119
- She's really gone, hasn't she?
- Come on, calm down.

31
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,639
- Leave it, I'll take care of her.
- Marina!

32
00:05:16,239 --> 00:05:19,238
Marina!

33
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:22,239
- Just look at my brother...
- Go and get some water.

34
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,358
- Got a light?
- Yes.

35
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:32,359
- Nervous?
- Yes.

36
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,958
If this is how she takes a bottle of whisky...

37
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,959
My father took 50 years before he had a fit.

38
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,839
Just that your father wasn't 15-years-old
when he started.

39
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,918
- Here's Alberto.
- Finally...

40
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:44,918
... let's hope he found the doctor.

41
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:47,118
Excellent, that way we can all
play doctors and nurses.

42
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:49,638
Tell me, will you be like this
after we get married?

43
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,639
- This witty?
- No, this idiotic.

44
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:58,758
- Good evening.
- It's her.

45
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,278
- How long has she been drinking?
- Around six years...

46
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,758
... including Sundays and the
other holidays.

47
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:15,759
Indeed, but none of us
thought it would come to this.

48
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,120
She was trying to impress us.
A bottle of scotch in a matter of minutes.

49
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,959
- Who is that?
- I don't know, a new guy. Martini wasn't there.

50
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,358
Oh boy!

51
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:34,359
Could you give me a hand, please?

52
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:02,118
- I'd like to speak to the parents.
- Whose?

53
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:05,119
- You're late, Doctor.
- Meaning.

54
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,238
Separated and remarried.

55
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:09,598
The mother went to America,
the father, to who knows where.

56
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,958
- Marina grew up alone.
- Thank heavens!

57
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:14,959
She has an uncle, her guardian. If it's
something serious, you could speak to him.

58
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:17,959
Of course, to have a fit of this kind...

59
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,958
... it means that her nervous system
was already rather worn out...

60
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,638
... it's not just the drinking.
- So?

61
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,878
I'll drop by tomorrow as well.

62
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,518
Of course, she will need a change of scenery,
a specialised clinic.

63
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:31,439
Switzerland has the best,
if you have the means.

64
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,438
She's a young maiden, without means,
without shoes...

65
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,118
... without even a little hat to
warm her little head during winter.

66
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:39,118
The poor thing!

67
00:07:39,119 --> 00:07:42,119
What should I tell her guardian?

68
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:45,199
As I say, a change of scenery...

69
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:48,078
... a change of atmosphere.
- Hey.

70
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:50,278
How much to we owe you, Doctor?

71
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,198
Nothing, thank you. I'm paid by the State.

72
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,199
- Could somebody drive me, please?
- Yes, I'll drive you.

73
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,558
Stay here if you like, I'll be back soon.

74
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:03,559
Annina, my fur coat!

75
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:10,239
Come on, Anselmo! Just a little trip
to Switzerland, she'll be back soon.

76
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,639
Of course, of course...
It's always so simple for you.

77
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,878
You're just like our mother.

78
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,079
Shall we dance?

79
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,999
- Should I drive you to the hospital?
- No, thank you.

80
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,279
I had already finished my shift,
I was about to leave anyway.

81
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,679
Then I'll drive you home.
Where do you live?

82
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,680
Oh, we haven't been properly introduced.
Margherita Cherè.

83
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,960
Margherita is too long, hence,
they call me Cherè.

84
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,960
- A pleasure to meet you. Mario...
- No, don't tell me. It's better this way.

85
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,598
What do you mean?

86
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,599
Passport number, star sign, politics, wages...

87
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,679
- I'll know everything about you.
- Oh, really?

88
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,399
- And who will tell you all this?
- Nobody.

89
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,159
The town, the walls...

90
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,559
The tables of the Meletti Café.

91
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,839
- Have you ever been there?
- No, I don't think so.

92
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,840
For me, all those places are the same.

93
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,440
- Good evening, Countess.
- Good evening.

94
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,639
- Good evening.
- Hello, Cherè!

95
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,640
- Good evening everyone!
- My respects, Countess.

96
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,199
- Good evening, Tammaro.
- Good evening.

97
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,879
Well, at least we managed to
pass them unobserved.

98
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,119
Indeed. The telegrams are already on their way...

99
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,120
Countess, sighted, new doctor, night...

100
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,318
But with me it's all in good taste.
They know that I don't mind.

101
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
- Gino, a gin and tonic. And you?
- A coffee, please.

102
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,119
Won't that stop you from sleeping?
How I envy you!

103
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Tonight I must study.
I'm specialising in biology.

104
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,439
So you work in a laboratory?

105
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Not yet, but I've asked the Director
for a transfer.

106
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,919
- Asked who? Geminiani?
- Oh, you know him?

107
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,920
You see, between us, we know everyone.

108
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,919
This is our temple, and over there
is the window...

109
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,959
... where we show ourselves off
for a few hours each day...

110
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,199
... with our label on our necks.

111
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,959
Yes, but of course, you don't
know anybody at the moment.

112
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,879
Mr. and Mrs. Foschini,
with a daughter to marry off...

113
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,880
... against her will, of course.

114
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,160
The Terenzi brothers, Vini and Affini.

115
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,720
They take that housekeeper of theirs wherever
they go, because she speaks good English.

116
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,679
It's a shame we're so late. The construction
and plastic materials moguls aren't here...

117
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,360
... our most important industries. But then you
already met their children at my place, earlier.

118
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,480
- And him?
- Oh, nothing, just the Mayor.

119
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,680
And you?

120
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,720
What would you say about yourself?

121
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,680
You see that tall, pale, thin
woman drinking a gin and tonic?

122
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:08,245
She thinks that her ancestors
established the town itself!

123
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,760
- Good evening, Sir.
- Good evening.

124
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,880
- Good evening, Countess.
- Good evening, Ridolfi.

125
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,520
Ridolfi, the business outlaw.

126
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Loans, etc. Everyone turns to him...

127
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,480
... but no one greets him.
He's quite the character.

128
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Nothing but trouble if you ask me.
End of the first lesson!

129
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,079
Good evening, everyone!

130
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,080
- Bye, Cherè!
- Good evening.

131
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Was that the Countess Cherè?

132
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,399
To what do I owe this honour?

133
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,959
It's a landlady's duty!

134
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,119
Did the Countess drive you home?

135
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,079
- How do you know that?
- I heard the sound of the car.

136
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,519
- And you knew it was her from
the sound of the car?! - No!

137
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,520
I only know the sound of
Alberto De Matteis' car.

138
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,640
The Ferrari. I was at the
window and saw her get out.

139
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,280
Fedora?

140
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,480
No, sorry, it's nothing.

141
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,520
What does a doctor do all day?

142
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Why are you laughing?

143
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,719
Because just a moment ago
I was thinking the same thing.

144
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,319
What does a girl like you do all day?

145
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Get bored. Help out around the home,
go shopping...

146
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,359
... and listen to my mother's preaching.

147
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,599
What do you expect me
to do in a place like this?

148
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,600
I need to get away from here,
move to a big city.

149
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,479
And what would that change?

150
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,480
- Everything.
- I'm not so sure.

151
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,239
That wouldn't help.

152
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,240
And besides, you can still find city
characteristics in a place like this.

153
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,879
I read just the other day that a big
theatre company is coming on Thursday.

154
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,880
They're performing The Daughter of Iorio.
Yes, I read that as well.

155
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,080
And... are you going?

156
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,960
I think so.

157
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,600
With someone?

158
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,920
I'm not seeing anyone,
If that's what you want to know.

159
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,880
And I have no one to go with.

160
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,319
- So?
- So, what?

161
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,320
- Aren't you going to invite me?
- You already invited yourself.

162
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,119
More importantly, how should we
deal with your mother's preaching?

163
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,758
- Should I ask her?
- You don't have to ask her anything.

164
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:25,259
You'll see, she'll only see it as
a chance of marriage...

165
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,799
... and will start telling me
how I can ensure you won't run away.

166
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,879
- Ah!
- Surprised?

167
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,880
For my mother it's
become a kind of obsession.

168
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,160
Ever since my father
ran off with someone else.

169
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:38,319
Well, even without this...

170
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,318
... our parents are at times
so different from us.

171
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,760
Yeah, one day or another,
you find yourself in church...

172
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,479
... speaking to the first priest
you can find.

173
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,999
Why are you talking like this, Fedora?

174
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You're young, beautiful,
you can do anything you want.

175
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,440
You haven't been here long
enough to understand how things are.

176
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,200
To aspire to be something more,
there's a wall to climb over.

177
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,159
A wall? What wall?

178
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,799
You don't see it, you'd never see it.

179
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,800
There's a wall, tall and invisible...

180
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,079
... a wall made of crystal.

181
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,119
And behind this wall
there are the Dauphins.

182
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,120
- The Dauphins?
- That's how they call them...

183
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,319
... just like the first-born sons
of the old Kings of France.

184
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,320
Our Dauphins don't
have a throne to inherit...

185
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,640
... but many other things.

186
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,920
After the Café, the De Matteis' mansion,
belonging to the parents of Alberto...

187
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,120
... was by far the most illustrious
institution in town.

188
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,680
Any official visit, any convention...

189
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,199
... any theatre company that
just so happened to step foot...

190
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,279
... inside our walls...

191
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,280
... the De Matteis family would always
and inexorably throw a party.

192
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,520
Even though their parties had
less class than the rarer...

193
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,159
... but more refined parties that Cherè
would throw at her house...

194
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,919
... these evenings were
considered quite the event.

195
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,199
They would begin speaking about
them a week beforehand...

196
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,200
... if only to know the names of the
privileged few who had been invited.

197
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,719
Such a wonderful house!

198
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,519
That evening, the party was in honour
of a passing theatre company...

199
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,399
... who had delivered a passable
rendition of The Daughter of Iorio...

200
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,319
... at the town theatre.

201
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,320
- At Berne? Ah, yes, I remember that place!
- Yes, from outside it's very similar.

202
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,520
My God, I'm tired. To do the show the same
night that we arrive always destroys me!

203
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,320
- Come inside, darling. Do you want to take a bath?
- Oh, thank you, but I'll be fine.

204
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,720
We're used to it by now, it's our life.
We're almost like gypsies, you see...

205
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,480
Where are the kids? Elsa? Elsa!

206
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,080
Come, come with me.

207
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,519
Elsa, this is Mr. Mattioli.

208
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,638
He's quite the character,
comes from Rome, too.

209
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,639
- This is my daughter.
- Your daughter?!

210
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Surprised, are you darling?
And this is the youngest one!

211
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,159
- Where is Anselmo?
- He's coming now.

212
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,160
- Elsa! Elsa!
- A pleasure. Excuse me.

213
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,359
Thank you, Countess, but I assure you
that despite my 57 years...

214
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:16,118
... I can still be the one to help a lady.

215
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,638
You're helping me just by being here.

216
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:21,639
- Okay?
- Thank you.

217
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,079
And the doctor? He hasn't arrived?

218
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:31,759
Don't worry, he'll be here.

219
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,919
By the way, that girl he was
with at the show wasn't at all bad.

220
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,599
Yes, I hear she's his landlady.

221
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,078
Who knows, perhaps she was included
in the price of the room.

222
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,238
Do you know what I've
always liked about you?

223
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,239
The spiritual value of your thoughts.

224
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:55,599
Indeed, Cherè had invited her new friend...

225
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:59,118
...the young doctor, and a girl,
Fedora, who was with him...

226
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,119
... to bore them to death as well.

227
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:05,398
But perhaps it was only me who was
bored, because Marina wasn't there.

228
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:08,399
My mother, for example, had already found
someone nice for me to court...

229
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:11,318
... and my father was conversing
with the young actress.

230
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:14,319
Just like my son. He has these paintings
in his room, I look at them...

231
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,238
... and I can't understand a damn thing!

232
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:20,239
Come, I want to introduce you to someone.
This is our Mayor! And this is Mr Mattioli...

233
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,478
... who has come all the way from Rome
for the new urban development plan.

234
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:26,118
- Make yourself at home, please.
- I was speaking to Ophelia...

235
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:28,638
... when I hear something behind me.

236
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:31,639
I turn around and Polonius had disappeared,
right there in the middle of the show. Gone!

237
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:35,639
Luckily enough the young lady came
out to ask me about Hamlet.

238
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:38,759
Poor Shakespeare! What did I tell you?

239
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,119
Sometimes it seems like we've gone
back to the age of horse and carriage.

240
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:45,599
Don't complain, Ma'am. At least you
lead an interesting life.

241
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,119
I've no idea why my mother even bothers
with these kind of events.

242
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:52,958
- Alberto!
- Let him speak...

243
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:55,959
... Alberto is made that way. Father always
says that we need to let him vent.

244
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:59,158
Well done! Well done! Top of the class...

245
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:01,638
... in sucking up to parents.

246
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:04,639
Tell me darling, why on earth would
you want these people in your house?

247
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:08,399
As if we weren't bored enough
at the theatre.

248
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,559
We  may as well just open a public
restaurant here, every Friday!

249
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:15,079
- Don't you think so, Doctor?
- Perhaps you should ask your mother.

250
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:20,879
It might be a way to make your
family even more popular.

251
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:23,478
And what do you say, Miss?

252
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:25,518
Me? I think that you don't need it.

253
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:27,558
I mean, De Matteis family is so well-known
here in the town...

254
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:30,078
- And then, Alberto...
- Alberto...

255
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:32,758
... is someone that people recognise
from a distance.

256
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:35,759
From the sound of his car, I imagine.

257
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:41,118
Let's go, Cherè.
It's better if we choose the records.

258
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,518
Pardon.

259
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:45,838
They're simple souls, bless them.

260
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,839
I thought you were about to
sock him one, as you kids say.

261
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:53,278
That doctor?

262
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,998
Sure...

263
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:58,999
- I'll steal his girl.
- If you can.

264
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,758
If I can?

265
00:20:02,759 --> 00:20:05,759
The doctor is a serious man, well-spoken,
perhaps he plans to marry her.

266
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,559
How much do you want to bet that
I'll take her away with me tonight?

267
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:14,639
- 10 bottles of Scotch.
- 10 bottles if I lose.

268
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,679
- But if I win, you give me 20.
- Why more?

269
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:23,359
It'll leave you the doctor free,
without a girl. All for you.

270
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,718
Attention, attention! The ladies
would like to propose a game.

271
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:29,238
- Be quiet for a moment.
- Yes, let's play a game! Come on!

272
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:32,118
No, the ladies wanted
to recite a monologue...

273
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:35,118
... and I suggested a game.
He always embarrasses me!

274
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:37,278
Why don't we play the game
where we share our darkest secrets?

275
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,279
Heaven forbid! That will just result
in some indescribable indecencies!

276
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,558
What's the name of that new game
that's all the rage in England?

277
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,559
It's called In or Out,
but it's so boring!

278
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:48,118
- Let's play The Killer.
- In the dark? Don't be silly!

279
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:50,118
And don't take off your jacket!
What kind of host are you?

280
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:53,119
- In the dark? How do you play?
- Come here.

281
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,919
He will explain it to you, seeing as
he always gets good grades in Italian.

282
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,920
- You hand the cards around...

283
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:02,118
... whoever gets the ace of
spades is the killer...

284
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:04,278
... and whoever gets the ace of
hearts is the detective.

285
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:06,318
- But we know it already.
- I don't. Let him speak.

286
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,478
The detective leaves the room and
you turn off the lights.

287
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,638
The person with the killer's card
has to then strangle someone.

288
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:13,238
The victim shouts out, the detective
comes back in and starts the interrogations.

289
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:16,239
This won't be easy for the detective!
Remember, we're actors who are always performing!

290
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:19,918
A shame that they didn't perform
at the theatre this evening, then.

291
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,919
- Sir didn't like the show then, it seems?
- Not at all.

292
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:26,319
What a harsh critic! Did you hear that?
We will need to be careful?

293
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,758
These small town kids are very advanced.

294
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,398
- Are you still hungry?
- Sorry?

295
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:34,718
I saw that you were eating with
a great appetite, if you're still hungry...

296
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:37,118
... you can ask the butler for more,
I'm sure we have some food leftover.

297
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:39,318
Listen to this, how rude!

298
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:42,319
So? Who will hand out the cards?

299
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:47,078
- Do you want to do the honours, Miss?
- Me?

300
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:50,079
Yes, you. Don't be afraid!

301
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:58,759
Here you go.

302
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:03,038
So, Mattioli, you're going
to have to kill me?

303
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,039
My lady, I assure you it will
be with the utmost delicacy.

304
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,118
- Really?
- You don't believe me?

305
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,119
- Completely nude?
- They call it the French Version.

306
00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:18,879
The gentleman is telling me the
most incredible things about cinema.

307
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:21,398
He says that for many films,
there's also a French version.

308
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:24,399
Yes, I know.
But considering we're in Italy...

309
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:27,679
... try to avoid broadcasting the
International Version of your legs.

310
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,919
Excuse me.

311
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,318
Why do you always have to make
such a bad impression?

312
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,118
- I can talk for two minutes with...?
- With a stranger?

313
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,119
We already have someone in this house,
someone who acts like a stranger.

314
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:47,439
Anselmo, why do you do this to yourself?
You read too much.

315
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:51,638
You always say that
you're against prejudice.

316
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:54,118
Ever since Marina
left you've been unbearable.

317
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:58,119
Marina... Marina is the only one,
the only one who understands me.

318
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,080
Here, Miss.

319
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,118
- Well, does everyone have a card?
- I don't!

320
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:12,158
Who's the detective?

321
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,198
Is it you, Doctor?
Then you must leave the room.

322
00:23:14,199 --> 00:23:16,118
No, unfortunately I have to go.

323
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:19,119
- It's me!
- Then the Mayor must leave the room!

324
00:23:21,479 --> 00:23:24,479
Excellent! The Mayor will make the
perfect detective.

325
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,438
- Of course...
- Why are you leaving?

326
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,958
- I'm sorry, but I have rounds at 6 in the morning.
- Such a shame!

327
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,798
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

328
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,799
- So, we're leaving?
- I mentioned that I had to leave, didn't I?

329
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:38,239
If you want to, you can stay.

330
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,398
Bye.

331
00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:44,278
You could drive her home, later.

332
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:47,279
Hold on, I haven't decided yet.

333
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:50,198
Well, he decided for you.

334
00:23:50,199 --> 00:23:53,199
- So, can I leave the room?
- Yes, go ahead.

335
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:59,759
Switch off the electricity at the mains.
Attention!

336
00:23:59,959 --> 00:24:02,959
The first rule is to be silent! Everyone
must move on the tips of their toes...

337
00:24:03,479 --> 00:24:06,479
... only the victim is allowed to scream.

338
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,438
Stop, everyone!
Don't move from where you are.

339
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:47,439
You, Cherè, tell me everything
you did before the murder took place.

340
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,919
I'll tell you everything. First I talked
business with Mr. Foresi...

341
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:54,879
... then I walked around a bit, met a few
people, whose names I can't remember...

342
00:25:56,599 --> 00:25:59,599
... and then I was sitting by the window.
There, I met Anselmo Foresi...

343
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:03,879
... who was with me when the murder took
place. I can attest to that.

344
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:07,599
And you, Alberto De Matteis?

345
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Mario...

346
00:26:47,879 --> 00:26:50,879
I don't know, Mario...
There are so many things I want to say...

347
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,078
... so that you can understand me...
- What is there to understand?

348
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,079
You're climbing over the wall, no?
Your mother will be very pleased.

349
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,118
No, it's not that simple.

350
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,119
I don't think there's anything simpler...
and more ridiculous, at the same time.

351
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:08,639
Just know that I, well,
I love you very much...

352
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:13,519
Doctor, leave the door open, please.

353
00:27:15,719 --> 00:27:18,198
So you're leaving? You've decided?

354
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:20,719
Goodbye, Ma'am.
I've left you the money in the kitchen...

355
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,720
... including the money
owed for the electricity.

356
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,080
Fedora, De Matteis called twice for you.

357
00:27:31,239 --> 00:27:33,638
De Matteis, the son of the Marquis!

358
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:36,639
He said that you should call him back when
you're awake. I can't quite believe it!

359
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:40,599
Now, you must tell me everything.
Everything, you hear?

360
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,118
When it rains, around here...

361
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,119
... it feels like the very sky is falling down.

362
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:56,798
Almost as if God Almighty has
decided to erase the earth...

363
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,799
... the walls, all traces, even the echo
of the few things that happen around here.

364
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:05,759
The town square ceases, then, in its
role as the people's living room...

365
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:08,878
... to the great advantage of the
cash registers at the Meletti Café...

366
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:11,798
.... into which, on that Sunday morning,
the important people...

367
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:14,398
... and we were important, the most important...

368
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,399
... were crammed, like a tin of sardines.

369
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,118
That morning, the topic of conversation...

370
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:22,958
... must have been the
florist's delivery boy...

371
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:25,959
... who was making his deliveries
up and down the town streets...

372
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,400
... despite the terrible weather.

373
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:33,679
There he goes! Every morning at 11,
two dozen red roses for Miss Elsa.

374
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,118
They're very beautiful.

375
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:39,118
Don't expect me to send you any...

376
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,879
... I'm not the romantic sort.
- Who sends them to you?

377
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,880
- Who knows?
- I was at the florist's just the other day.

378
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,119
- Getting jealous, are we?
- No! Just out of curiosity.

379
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:51,199
- Well?
- He won't tell, even under torture.

380
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:54,958
Ah, then we find ourselves up against
quite the Annunzianan admirer.

381
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:57,399
- What?
- Annunzianan.

382
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,398
The card says he's from Annunzio.
Haven't you heard of the place?

383
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:03,598
I already spend enough of my time
making those cards....

384
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,599
... as if I'd want to read
what people write on them.

385
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,718
There's one thing I don't understand...

386
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:10,638
... are you marrying Elsa to make
cards with my father's plastic...

387
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:13,478
... or to make his plastic with your cards?

388
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:15,798
Listen to these intellectuals, idealists...

389
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:18,158
... our marriage will be built on love,
isn't that right Elsa?

390
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,159
- You don't love money?
- Money? Of course!

391
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,638
But our marriage is one of love.

392
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:26,239
Exactly.

393
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,720
- Darling, your Pernod.
- Thank you.

394
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,159
Drink it slowly, It's only a little bit
stronger than Anisette, you'll see.

395
00:29:37,439 --> 00:29:39,958
Yes, just a little bit stronger.
It only killed...

396
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:42,358
... a couple of French painters
in the last century.

397
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,838
They died of hunger, not Pernod!

398
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:47,198
By the way, Anselmo, when am I going to
see that 30,000 lire you owe me?

399
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:49,759
- Never.
- Anselmo is a disaster.

400
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,639
I always lend him my car and I have
to put petrol in it for him, too.

401
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,558
He has debts all over town.

402
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,559
I'm sorry, Anselmo, but is the family fortune
not good enough for you, by any chance?

403
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:01,079
- I don't want my father's money.
- Yet you want mine, do you?

404
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:04,319
Listen, no one's asking you to understand me,
don't tire yourself out!

405
00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:07,679
Let's give the artist the money he's owed.

406
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,598
Want to play for that 30,000 lire at dice?

407
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,638
Of course! Fortune favours the bold.

408
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:14,639
- Who wants chocolates?
- Me.

409
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,438
God, look how much it's raining!

410
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:36,678
Oh, Doctor!

411
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:39,238
You seem changed since the last time I saw you.

412
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:42,118
You, on the other hand, are exactly the same.
A coffee, please.

413
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:45,119
Perhaps it's just me, but you seem to have
such an unhappy, depressed look about you...

414
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:48,959
... almost as if something had happened to you,
some kind of great suffering.

415
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:53,118
Listen, why don't you come to my house
one of these evenings?

416
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:56,119
That way we can meet up as friends,
play cards, dance...

417
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:00,399
We're very sympathetic people, you know?

418
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,798
Listen, Mr. De Matteis,
could you do me a favour?

419
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:06,799
- Certainly.
- When you see me, keep a wide berth.

420
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:12,159
Yes, keep a wide berth... very wide.

421
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:15,959
Why's that, Doctor, are you diseased?

422
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,319
Because otherwise I might just have to
rearrange your face.

423
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,558
And I don't want to
give you the satisfaction.

424
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,559
Doctor, I'm afraid you won't be
rearranging anyone's face...

425
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:27,998
... least of all mine.
- And why's that?

426
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:29,998
- Because you're a De Matteis?
- No.

427
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:32,118
Because your father will have me sent
away from the hospital?

428
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:35,119
No, because I'll rearrange yours first.

429
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:41,198
Listen, I'm in no mood to play games today.

430
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:44,199
But if you fancy it another time, let me know.

431
00:31:44,439 --> 00:31:47,439
I'm sure I can find a few free minutes.

432
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:53,318
- Hello!
- What happened to you?

433
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:55,958
It's the first time I've ever
seen you around before midday.

434
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:58,959
There are days in which
just about everything happens.

435
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:01,999
Don't look at me, I'm a monster.
I've just spent an entire night in hell.

436
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:06,319
- How are you?
- I'll be at the table with the others.

437
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,799
I'll see you soon, Doctor.

438
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Hopefully when you're not in such a hurry.

439
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:16,439
- What happened?
- Oh, nothing. Nonsense.

440
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,078
How are you finding the hotel?

441
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:23,079
For me, hotels are all the same,
just like cafés.

442
00:32:23,719 --> 00:32:26,719
You're rather pale, do you want a cognac?

443
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,079
No, it's just been a bad day. It'll pass.

444
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,680
Everything passes, no? Sooner or later.

445
00:32:35,959 --> 00:32:38,959
Yes, sooner or later.

446
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:42,919
Listen, keep in touch.
Well, it's needless to say...

447
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,120
... in this town I'm sure we'll bump
into each other again.

448
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,280
- What's wrong, Cherè?
- Nothing, nothing, Why?

449
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:54,079
Don't all look at me like that.
I feel so out of sorts, today.

450
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:56,918
Of course not, Cherè, you look beautiful.
Isn't that right?

451
00:32:56,919 --> 00:32:59,558
When you came in, I was wondering
how it is that you're always so...

452
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:02,478
... neat and elegant, even when you
haven't slept and it's raining.

453
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:05,479
Hey, why don't you marry Cherè, instead?

454
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:08,918
What was all that about, before?

455
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:11,919
Nothing. The middle classes like to raise
their voice, that's democracy for you.

456
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,678
By the way, you only
sent me 10 bottles, Cherè.

457
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,478
- Bottles? What bottles?
- A bet.

458
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:22,479
A stupid bet, on a stupid evening.
That's all.

459
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:25,118
Ridolfi!

460
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:27,919
- You lose.
- Come on, let's start over.

461
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,920
Ridolfi, you've never given us the honour
of gracing our table with your presence!

462
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:34,479
- Good day everyone.
- Come on, I'll buy you a Campari.

463
00:33:34,719 --> 00:33:37,558
- Come and sit here with us.
- Thank you. Please, just a moment...

464
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,559
- Cherè, what are you thinking?
- Why? What's so terrible about him?

465
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:44,479
It might be funny, you know?
It's always us, just us and no one else.

466
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Is it just me, or are Cherè's
problems Ridolfi-related?

467
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,519
What happened in the
two months that followed?

468
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,198
It's so difficult for me to remember...

469
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,918
... the images from the days before
Marina returned...

470
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:13,919
... they appear so irreparably empty,
out of focus.

471
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,119
Yes, a memory of Cherè...

472
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:21,439
We came to know, sometime after,
that during that period...

473
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,238
... around the middle of February,
Cherè had a romantic liaison...

474
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,239
... with the young doctor
that Fedora had abandoned.

475
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,318
But it was a brief thing, one of those
that finish at dawn...

476
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:34,079
... with the first rays of sun filtering
through the half-closed blinds.

477
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,640
When I was a child,
I'd spend hours in this room.

478
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:48,158
My parents were always away.

479
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,159
Were you a sad or a happy child?

480
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:56,879
Oh, I was as I am now, I think.

481
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:03,279
Sad or happy?

482
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:12,719
It's late, almost 8 o'clock already,
I need to get dressed...

483
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,119
... I have a business meeting.
Do you remember Ridolfi?

484
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,518
The one you pointed out to
me at the Meletti, right?

485
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:25,079
Such an impression you made on me. Ever since
that evening, since the first time I saw you.

486
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,360
It was a strange evening, wasn't it?

487
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:36,159
Indeed...

488
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:52,639
Don't look at me. If you look at me,
I won't be able to do my make-up properly.

489
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,678
What's wrong, Cherè?

490
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:59,478
What do you mean, what's wrong?

491
00:35:59,479 --> 00:36:02,479
There's something not right, isn't there?

492
00:36:03,479 --> 00:36:06,479
If that's what you mean,
there are many things that aren't right.

493
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,680
- You, for example.
- What problems do I have?

494
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,360
Me, for example.

495
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:22,959
No, that isn't it.
There's something else, I'm sure of it.

496
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:26,679
Certainly. Problems never arise
on their own, do they?

497
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,678
That's something my family has had to
come to terms with since the very beginning.

498
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:37,719
Mario...

499
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:41,999
You're waiting for something, aren't you?

500
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,239
It's not easy to forget her.

501
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:59,278
You've been very good to me, Cherè.

502
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:02,279
Oh, I assure you,
it wasn't such a huge sacrifice.

503
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:07,999
So it was, the happiest person in our 
group at that time was Fedora.

504
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:11,118
Her love affair with Alberto continued...

505
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,278
... announced regularly by the
rumble of his Ferrari.

506
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:16,279
By that time she was completely
and entirely ours, almost suddenly...

507
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:19,439
...drawing all eyes in the town towards her,
in the role of Aspiring Dauphine.

508
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:26,759
Then, finally we got a telegram from Marina,
announcing her arrival.

509
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:57,159
Elsa? Elsa!

510
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,360
Elsa, what's wrong?

511
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:15,199
Nothing.

512
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:18,558
I'm over it now.

513
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:21,559
Sometimes I get this way,
where nothing makes sense...

514
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:26,159
I feel as though everything is useless.

515
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:34,879
Come on, everything will be useless if we don't
go and retrieve our survivor from Switzerland!

516
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:38,479
Come on, up you get!

517
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,960
- You're happy, aren't you?
- Of course.

518
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,999
Will she be arriving at Ancona, your Marina?

519
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,998
- 2, 4, 6, 8...
- What time is it?

520
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:09,559
- 6 o'clock.
- Oh God, 6 o'clock!

521
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:13,519
I might start crying all over again.

522
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:16,919
Come on, don't take all day!

523
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:25,559
- What do you want me to wear?
- A deep-sea diving suit.

524
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,800
- Elsa!
- What, never seen a nude woman before?

525
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:37,359
You're not a woman, you're my sister!

526
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:42,159
You can turn around, I'm dressed.

527
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:46,519
That'll be Alberto and Fedora.
Aren't they a little early?

528
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,759
Those in love never sleep.
Lucky them.

529
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:06,879
Anselmo!

530
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:12,639
I've never seen you up so early.

531
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:24,079
Where's the night-owl been?

532
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,360
Who was she with? Mattioli?

533
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,118
Anselmo, could it be that you're still
upset by the actions of our mother?

534
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,159
Elsa, get it into your head:
I'm not like you!

535
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,678
I didn't realise your
car was as slow as that.

536
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:03,158
- What platform is it?
- I don't know.

537
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:06,078
It's not here yet!

538
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,079
- Your attention, please!
- Quiet, I'm trying to hear...

539
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:12,279
The express train coming from Lugano,
Chiasso, Milan, Bologna...

540
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:15,238
... is delayed by 25 minutes.

541
00:42:15,239 --> 00:42:17,279
What shall I do now?
Listen, I'm going to sit down.

542
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,278
No, hold on! Where are you going?
Let's go and see the sea.

543
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:35,759
Look out.

544
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:54,919
Watch out, here's where I trip over.

545
00:42:55,479 --> 00:42:58,159
- There's the sea.
- I think I might go for a swim.

546
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,160
- In March, are you crazy?
- It's sunny!

547
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:18,959
Have you seen how they kiss each other?
To me these things...

548
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:22,278
You don't like to watch them?

549
00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:25,279
Well done! Encore!

550
00:43:30,879 --> 00:43:33,879
You're an idiot, Anselmo!
An imbecile!

551
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:46,319
How old are you, Elsa?
Don't you realise how old you are?

552
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,759
Always with your eye to the keyhole.

553
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,760
If you could, you would put
sound recorders under people's beds...

554
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,960
... hidden video cameras!
- Leave her alone, Anselmo, come on.

555
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:00,559
Exactly, because you
need Elsa as an audience.

556
00:44:00,759 --> 00:44:03,759
Without an audience, I ask myself what
you'd be doing with your life!

557
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:07,359
What's wrong with him? Did your brother fall
out the wrong side of the bed this morning?

558
00:44:12,919 --> 00:44:14,918
- Here, have a smoke.
- No, thanks.

559
00:44:14,919 --> 00:44:17,798
Come on guys, let's do something... a game,
I don't know, just to pass the time!

560
00:44:17,799 --> 00:44:20,799
Of course, what a wonderful idea!
Do you know what we can do?

561
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:24,079
Let's play the Why? game.
Why did we come here?

562
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:27,719
Why are we waiting?
Why do we see each other every damn day?

563
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:30,118
Why are we always the same faces?

564
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:33,119
Wasn't it your idea that we all come
here to welcome back Marina?

565
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,440
But of course!
I'm here because I'm waiting for Marina...

566
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:39,519
... you guys are watching me wait,
and us three are watching you two.

567
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:43,199
And what are two doing?
Watching us, and so on.

568
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,119
I see, it looks like that time again.
His seasonal crisis has begun...

569
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,838
... have courage, Fedora.
- Precisely.

570
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,438
If there's one thing that Fedora needs,
it's courage.

571
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,279
- What does that mean?
- Nothing, Fedora.

572
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,278
Just that yours is a dangerous
game and that it requires courage.

573
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,118
- And what would that be?
- Leave it.

574
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:03,119
I'm talking to Fedora, not you.

575
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,359
Why?

576
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:08,759
Don't you think one requires courage
to be seen going around with you...

577
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,798
... day and night, in this dirty town?

578
00:45:10,799 --> 00:45:12,159
Now you've done it. Now you've done it!

579
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:15,559
- Don't touch my brother!
- Enough, come on, let's go.

580
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:18,639
Don't act like children.

581
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:26,479
No courage, Anselmo.
And I'm not playing any games.

582
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,480
Exactly, that's enough from you!
Why are you getting involved?

583
00:45:29,879 --> 00:45:32,879
Even if Alberto and Fedora end up
getting married, that's their business.

584
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,518
The important thing is that they're
good together, that they love each other.

585
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:39,519
Yes, and I suppose you're marrying
Ridolfi out of love, are you?

586
00:45:39,759 --> 00:45:42,759
I knew it. What did you think?

587
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:45,839
That you could pass off inviting him
to our table as if it was by chance?

588
00:45:45,879 --> 00:45:48,879
And how can you do such a thing?
Such a vulgar man, and so old!

589
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:58,159
- Your attention, please!
- Let's go, Fedora.

590
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,119
The express train coming from Lugano,
Chiasso, Milan, Bologna...

591
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,440
... is approaching platform 4.
- All because of a 20 minute delay.

592
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,319
Porter!

593
00:46:57,479 --> 00:47:00,479
Well, how do I look?
I've changed, haven't I?

594
00:47:23,919 --> 00:47:26,918
I don't think I've ever been
so happy in my entire life...

595
00:47:26,919 --> 00:47:29,919
... as I was on that afternoon
by the seashore.

596
00:47:29,959 --> 00:47:32,398
The indifference and anguish that
took hold of me...

597
00:47:32,399 --> 00:47:34,678
... especially in the last days
of our separation...

598
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:37,679
... just disappeared as soon as
I saw her step down from the train.

599
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,559
As soon as she was in my arms again.

600
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:44,638
With her I would finally
find the strength to do...

601
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:47,158
... what it was I'd dreamed
of doing for so long.

602
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:50,159
To leave. Drop everything.
Go abroad forever.

603
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:01,639
- Anselmo?
- Yes?

604
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,878
Why aren't you saying anything?

605
00:48:04,879 --> 00:48:07,878
- What day is it today?
- Monday.

606
00:48:07,879 --> 00:48:10,879
No, I mean the date.

607
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,880
Monday, the 10th of March. Why?

608
00:48:14,279 --> 00:48:17,279
The 10th of March, 1960.

609
00:48:17,439 --> 00:48:20,439
My life begins again today, with you.

610
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:24,239
Anselmo, I love you.

611
00:48:41,759 --> 00:48:44,638
So why did you say that you were
so happy by yourself in Switzerland, eh?

612
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:46,398
No, Anselmo!

613
00:48:46,399 --> 00:48:49,399
Is that why you didn't reply to my letters?

614
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:52,679
- Is that it? Tell me!
- No, let go of me!

615
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,760
Who said that I was so happy?
Switzerland is like some kind of Purgatory.

616
00:49:08,439 --> 00:49:11,439
It was the first time I'd been
on my own for so long.

617
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,080
I had the chance to
think about lots of things.

618
00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:19,878
It's so nice here!

619
00:49:19,879 --> 00:49:22,879
Do you know that my inheritance
has finally gone through?

620
00:49:24,279 --> 00:49:27,118
There are places my family bought
that look like this.

621
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,119
You've no idea how many things
I now own, at just 20 years old.

622
00:49:31,279 --> 00:49:33,438
2,000 hectares of land,
A factory...

623
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:36,158
... and there's an estate, close to Modena,
That stretches all the way down to the sea.

624
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:39,159
Your silence stretches as far as the ocean
Who said that?

625
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:43,398
Anselmo Foresi, Volume 1, juvenile poetry.

626
00:49:43,399 --> 00:49:46,399
If a poet starts to cite himself,
it's a sure sign that he's a failure.

627
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:49,839
Oh, stop that!

628
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:53,238
You know that when we get home
you'll need to do a lot of work?

629
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:56,239
- You'll have to help me out, too.
- When we get home?

630
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:59,319
- When we get home, where?
- I was thinking Modena.

631
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:06,719
Oh, yes, but you still don't know yet.
I'm going to become a business woman.

632
00:50:06,959 --> 00:50:09,959
I'm buying into your father's company at 30%.
We've already reached an agreement.

633
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,559
Sorry, Marina, but I don't understand.

634
00:50:13,879 --> 00:50:16,879
- My father, when did you see him?
- We wrote to each other.

635
00:50:17,879 --> 00:50:20,879
See, Anselmo, it won't be as bad as you think,
it'll be a lot of fun.

636
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:24,199
There are so many things to do.
We have to organise everything, to...

637
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,240
... to move house, travel, speak with workers,
discuss things with the farmers...

638
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,878
What are you saying?

639
00:50:30,879 --> 00:50:33,879
Anselmo, try to understand me.

640
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,278
What is there to understand? That you've gone crazy?
That Switzerland has gone to your head?

641
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:41,998
We've always dreamed of leaving
this place forever...

642
00:50:41,999 --> 00:50:44,999
... we've always hated this life!
And now everything has changed?

643
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:49,278
And who are you in business with?
With my father!

644
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:52,279
- And without even telling me!
- Wait, you'll see! It's different...

645
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:55,719
Yes! Different from what you've always been,
different from who I thought you were...

646
00:50:55,959 --> 00:50:58,158
... a woman who would never
live like one of them...

647
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:00,118
... with a head full of nothing
but bank notes!

648
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:02,198
And do you think it's right to
stay at home and do nothing all day?

649
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:04,118
To do nothing but listen to gossip...

650
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:07,119
... when there's capital
that can be doubled?

651
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:11,159
Marina, we can throw
your capital in the river...

652
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:14,318
... we can spit on it, burn it!
- But that's not right!

653
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,518
It's money I earned, isn't it?

654
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:19,519
And you don't have the right... you can't spend
your entire life running around the world.

655
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:24,239
Without taking into account what it costs,
and that there is property to maintain.

656
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:30,719
Anselmo, I... I love you.

657
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,758
I can't imagine my life without you.

658
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,960
Marina, Marina! Come back to me!

659
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:41,719
The life that we've always dreamed of
is something else, something different!

660
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
To get out of here, away from these
people and their problems...

661
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:48,078
... that we hardly even know,
that we don't understand!

662
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,079
With you by my side,
I can start writing again, but...

663
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,439
... but we need to be strong,
and to break free of all this...

664
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,478
... this mentality, this world!

665
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:58,238
It's our one and only duty.
To be ourselves...

666
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:01,239
... change our lives, don't you see?
- And what I want doesn't involve change?

667
00:52:04,799 --> 00:52:07,799
What happened, Marina?

668
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,520
Nothing. Nothing, nothing!

669
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,918
You talk as if we were still kids,
as if we didn't have...

670
00:52:16,919 --> 00:52:19,919
... responsibilities.
For everyone, even for money...

671
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:23,359
And you just can't.

672
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:33,439
What a shame, Marina.

673
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:39,679
My God, what a shame.

674
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:54,559
You can go to Modena by yourself.
I... I just don't know...

675
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:43,239
- What's wrong?
- No, nothing, I was just thinking.

676
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,798
You're a thinker...

677
00:55:47,799 --> 00:55:50,118
I was thinking that you've never
told me that you love me.

678
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:53,119
- Why are you laughing?

679
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:59,119
I love you, I dream about you,
I can't live without you...

680
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:04,399
- Doesn't that make you laugh?
- No.

681
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,559
These are things that Anselmo would say,
the other thinker.

682
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:12,118
And also, to tell you the truth...

683
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,119
... I still haven't decided which
I love more, you or the Ferrari.

684
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,798
Calm down. If you want,
I can learn to say I love you.

685
00:56:23,479 --> 00:56:26,198
Come in!

686
00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:29,199
- Your cigarettes.
- What are you waiting for? Throw them.

687
00:56:32,359 --> 00:56:35,359
- Bad throw, but it's okay.
- Excuse me.

688
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:37,798
What's wrong?

689
00:56:37,799 --> 00:56:40,358
Are you afraid he'll recognise you
and tell your mother?

690
00:56:40,359 --> 00:56:43,359
- It's not that.
- Then what is it?

691
00:56:43,439 --> 00:56:46,439
Nothing.

692
00:56:47,319 --> 00:56:50,319
You too...

693
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,198
Me too, what?

694
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:57,199
The terrible humiliation,
the shame, the scandal...

695
00:56:58,439 --> 00:57:01,439
To be discovered with a man
in a hotel room.

696
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:05,199
- Always the same story.
- Are all your women like this, then?

697
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:08,758
- All of them.
- First they're here...

698
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:11,759
... then they're trying to save face.

699
00:57:12,479 --> 00:57:15,479
- Exactly.
- Just like me, then?

700
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:27,399
- What are you doing?
- Getting dressed.

701
00:57:32,759 --> 00:57:34,918
Didn't you tell me that you could
stay out until 8?

702
00:57:34,919 --> 00:57:37,919
There's a bus at quarter past 7.
You can stay here, if you want.

703
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:42,158
Okay.

704
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:45,078
I'll just have to tell the porter
to send me up another.

705
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:48,079
This hotel is really well-furnished.

706
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:53,398
Alberto, why are people so different
when you get to know them...

707
00:57:53,399 --> 00:57:56,399
... as opposed to how they seemed from afar?
- You're different as well.

708
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:00,078
From afar you seemed less stupid.

709
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,079
What do you want to do?
Will you tell me what you want to do?

710
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:08,799
You know just as well as I do
how things are around here.

711
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,800
Everyone has seen you with me: getting
in the car, coming home late at night.

712
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:16,238
Who would ever have the courage
to marry you now...

713
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:18,478
... to face up to the jokes of friends...

714
00:58:18,479 --> 00:58:21,479
... the gossip at the Café?

715
00:58:21,959 --> 00:58:24,959
You would have everyone against you,
you know. Everyone.

716
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:28,719
You would have to put up with the
muttering and contempt of the whole town.

717
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,119
If not you can ask your mother.
Ask her how much she cried over your father.

718
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:36,079
People don't forgive here.

719
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:40,079
What are you waiting for?
You'll miss your bus.

720
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:53,519
Even when we came to know about it,
later on...

721
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,520
... it didn't surprise me that Fedora
had been deluded when she was with Alberto.

722
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,599
And that their relationship had been a mistake,
I had always gotten that impression...

723
00:59:02,399 --> 00:59:05,399
... but it didn't even surprise me that
Fedora stayed with him for so long.

724
00:59:07,799 --> 00:59:10,118
Though perhaps my lack of surprise...

725
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:13,119
... is just a product of this town,
this world of ours.

726
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:17,759
In those days, I was going through
a particularly intense period myself.

727
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:21,599
I had decided to leave anyway,
even without Marina...

728
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,318
... even without money,
without any idea where I was going.

729
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:27,319
In the meantime, Cherè had offered me a room,
and I would eventually leave from her place.

730
00:59:28,759 --> 00:59:31,759
The important thing was to get out of that house,
to not see my father again...

731
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:36,239
After his agreement with Marina, I felt
the strongest sense of loathing towards him.

732
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:54,679
Well?

733
00:59:55,279 --> 00:59:58,279
- Have you forgotten anything?
- Yes, I've left a letter on the table...

734
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,958
... explaining everything,
or at least what needs to be explained.

735
01:00:00,959 --> 01:00:03,798
Let me pass, please.
Let's not make a big deal out of this.

736
01:00:03,799 --> 01:00:05,918
I won't let you leave.

737
01:00:05,919 --> 01:00:07,758
Once again, you don't know what you're doing.

738
01:00:07,759 --> 01:00:10,759
I've never been so sure, I swear to you.

739
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:14,399
What is it? You don't believe in
tough education anymore?

740
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:18,599
Anselmo, we've never understood one another.

741
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:22,199
- Anselmo, listen. Listen to me...
- Change the record, Father.

742
01:00:23,479 --> 01:00:25,558
- Bye.
- Anselmo!

743
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:28,118
What do you want from me?

744
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:30,718
Ever since I was born,
you've wanted me to think, live...

745
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:33,478
... to work like you.
Money, only money.

746
01:00:33,479 --> 01:00:36,479
It's all you knew to offer me.
But I don't want your money!

747
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:40,118
Do you understand,
or should I make it clearer?

748
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:43,119
I won't allow it, Anselmo!
I won't allow you to talk to me this way!

749
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:46,398
I worked for 15 years to make my
business what it is today.

750
01:00:46,399 --> 01:00:49,278
15 years of sweat, of strain, of hard work!

751
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:52,279
And you don't even know what
the word work means!

752
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:55,238
- Nor the word steal.
- What did you say?

753
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:58,239
- Say it again!
- I said steal.

754
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,798
Why, what did you think?
Did you think that people don't talk?

755
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,558
That my schoolmates and friends
didn't know, didn't say anything?

756
01:01:07,279 --> 01:01:10,279
Tell me, Father, what if he had made it back from
Germany too, instead of just his wife...

757
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,079
... that Jewish friend of yours who entrusted
you with everything, what would you be today?

758
01:01:17,959 --> 01:01:20,959
I don't know what they told you, Anselmo.

759
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:25,879
I just know that...

760
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:29,239
Let it go, Father.
I'm starting to feel nauseous...

761
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:34,478
... the same nausea I've always felt...

762
01:01:34,479 --> 01:01:37,479
... from being stuck in this house.

763
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,960
Elsa would be left on her own.
That was the only regret I had about leaving.

764
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,678
She wouldn't have anyone to
whom she could talk anymore...

765
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:31,638
... to whom she could vent,
with her subtle dissatisfaction...

766
01:02:31,639 --> 01:02:34,639
... that bitterness of hers that
so many found difficult to understand.

767
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:40,079
I would imagine her waking up in the morning,
or enduring long and empty afternoons...

768
01:02:40,959 --> 01:02:43,959
... or in the evening, on the town streets.

769
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:47,679
What I didn't imagine, however, was that
around this time she would come to know...

770
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:51,159
... the name of the secret admirer that
had been sending her roses every morning.

771
01:03:00,759 --> 01:03:03,759
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Miss.

772
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:07,238
So, you go to church as well?

773
01:03:07,239 --> 01:03:10,239
- And you? Where are you going?
- I'm the one who asked the question.

774
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:14,199
- Yes, I go to church.
- And to pray for who?

775
01:03:14,879 --> 01:03:17,799
For her soul?

776
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,800
Or perhaps for the souls of
those people you take money from?

777
01:03:20,919 --> 01:03:23,919
That was two questions,
and it's your turn to answer first.

778
01:03:24,359 --> 01:03:27,359
Very well. Home, I'm going home.

779
01:03:29,999 --> 01:03:32,678
Good evening.

780
01:03:32,679 --> 01:03:35,679
Perhaps I can drive you.
I have my car just around the corner.

781
01:03:35,759 --> 01:03:38,439
That way, tomorrow everyone
will know about it!

782
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,440
I'll wait at the corner, okay?

783
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,918
What makes you think I'll accept?

784
01:03:46,919 --> 01:03:49,919
Why did you stop to talk to me, then?

785
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:53,599
A case of sudden curiosity.
Won't that do?

786
01:03:54,959 --> 01:03:57,959
- Very well. Excuse me, good evening.
- Listen...

787
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:03,079
It's not like I said no.

788
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,440
Wait! Where are you going?

789
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,640
I didn't even say yes!

790
01:04:23,919 --> 01:04:26,919
And Marina?

791
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:30,159
You don't even want to try again,
to stop by her house?

792
01:04:31,439 --> 01:04:34,439
By now, Marina will be in Modena.

793
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:37,640
She didn't waste any time,
left again right away.

794
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:40,679
Between leave and double,
she chose double... her money.

795
01:04:53,919 --> 01:04:56,919
Thank you.

796
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:23,559
Anselmo, we don't need this.

797
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:28,600
Not you...

798
01:05:29,399 --> 01:05:31,999
... and not me.

799
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Did you ever see him again?

800
01:05:35,159 --> 01:05:38,159
You haven't forgotten him, of course.

801
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,079
Anselmo, listen. Listen to me...

802
01:05:43,919 --> 01:05:46,479
You need to leave.

803
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,480
If you stay here, even with me,
you'll never leave.

804
01:05:50,959 --> 01:05:53,959
Isn't that why you gave up on Marina?

805
01:05:54,399 --> 01:05:57,399
What are you doing here?
What are you waiting for?

806
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,800
Yes, what am I waiting for?
That's the problem.

807
01:06:01,479 --> 01:06:03,838
Why did I stop here at your house?

808
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:06,839
Why didn't I leave with her
before she went to Switzerland?

809
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:11,878
It's not that simple, Cherè.

810
01:06:11,879 --> 01:06:14,879
There are things one carries with him
since the day he was born.

811
01:06:16,359 --> 01:06:19,238
Born into a certain family, a certain town...

812
01:06:19,239 --> 01:06:22,239
... into a certain social standing.

813
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,878
It's like a mark, Cherè.
An actual brand from a factory.

814
01:06:27,719 --> 01:06:30,719
The worst thing is that I can't connect
with those on the other side...

815
01:06:30,959 --> 01:06:33,439
They see the mark, and even if you...

816
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,440
And they defend you.
That way you lose this contact.

817
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,600
No, Cherè, the truth is that you need to
be stronger, more courageous.

818
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:48,238
Everything else is just excuses,
banal excuses.

819
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:50,518
Indeed, like those I have now.

820
01:06:50,519 --> 01:06:53,519
To not be able to leave because
I don't have enough money.

821
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,118
Poor excuse, Anselmo.

822
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:00,119
If you need money, I can give you some.
How much do you need?

823
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:04,319
No, don't worry, Cherè.
You're an angel, as I always tell you.

824
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:10,079
You'll see, one of these mornings
you'll walk in here...

825
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:13,119
... and find the room empty.
Prince Hamlet will have made up his mind...

826
01:07:14,359 --> 01:07:17,359
... will have left Elsinore Castle behind.

827
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,360
Really? Promise?

828
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:24,199
- I promise.
- And the money?

829
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:28,159
I'll ask to borrow them from Ridolfi.
Didn't you have financial problems with him?

830
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:32,238
Yes, of course.

831
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:35,239
And you also know in what elegant
manner I've chosen to resolve them.

832
01:07:37,439 --> 01:07:39,878
- Have you decided?
- More or less.

833
01:07:39,879 --> 01:07:42,879
I will give him my hand,
my position, my charm.

834
01:07:44,159 --> 01:07:47,159
A modern conclusion, we'll call it,
for a noble old lady.

835
01:07:49,239 --> 01:07:52,239
We'll eat in my room,
how does that sound?

836
01:07:52,479 --> 01:07:55,278
Annina! By the way...

837
01:07:55,279 --> 01:07:57,919
Do you want to hear a funny story?

838
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,238
Come on, let's hear it!

839
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:03,239
Do you want to hear the name of the person
who was sending flowers to your sister?

840
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,960
It was him, Mr. Ridolfi.

841
01:08:08,479 --> 01:08:11,358
- My future husband.
- I don't believe it!

842
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:14,359
He's crazy about her!
I finally realised that...

843
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:17,598
... one of the reasons he wanted
to marry me...

844
01:08:17,599 --> 01:08:20,599
... was because he would gain
access to our world, to her...

845
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,719
Does Elsa know that?

846
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:26,719
Yes, we laughed about it
for an entire afternoon.

847
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,438
At the start she wouldn't even believe it...

848
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,439
... and then, well, you know what Elsa is like.
This kind of things make her mad.

849
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:36,319
Actually, I saw her a while ago...

850
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,320
... in front of the church.
She had bumped into him by chance.

851
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:42,399
I'm sure you can imagine
how much fun she's having!

852
01:08:45,999 --> 01:08:48,999
Anselmo, what's wrong?
What are you doing, going somewhere?

853
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:53,880
You don't know Elsa, she's capable anything.
Just like my mother.

854
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:06,679
What's wrong?

855
01:09:07,159 --> 01:09:10,159
Feeling guilty?

856
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:13,238
How much did all those flowers cost you?

857
01:09:13,239 --> 01:09:16,078
Why?

858
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:19,079
Two dozen roses for two months.
Almost half a million.

859
01:09:31,639 --> 01:09:34,639
When are you marrying her?

860
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:38,239
- Who?
- Margherita Cherè.

861
01:09:38,959 --> 01:09:41,959
No, Elsa. You can sleep well tonight.

862
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:46,879
Nothing sacrilegious will happen between us.

863
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:50,279
- I'll tell her tomorrow anyway, your friend.
- Why?

864
01:09:51,239 --> 01:09:53,919
Never mind, Elsa. I don't believe you
would ever be able to understand me.

865
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,920
Yes, your secrets.
You live on secrets.

866
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,238
You've made an industry out of it.

867
01:09:59,239 --> 01:10:02,239
It's not me that likes secrets.

868
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:06,399
It's this town.

869
01:10:46,959 --> 01:10:49,959
Such recklessness!
He was leaning across to wave to me...

870
01:10:50,119 --> 01:10:53,119
... must have turned too much and
lost control of the car.

871
01:10:54,359 --> 01:10:57,359
Thank God nobody is seriously hurt!

872
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,680
Anselmo! Anselmo, you're okay, aren't you?

873
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:06,200
I knew right there and then,
on Mazzini Street...

874
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,679
... that this was the end of my escape,
and my rebellion...

875
01:11:10,359 --> 01:11:14,359
... my desperate act was immediately
transformed into a convincing accident...

876
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:18,079
My father would hush everything up,
and I would return home...

877
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:21,479
Once again, nothing had happened...

878
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:24,760
I would take long walks alone
or spend entire days...

879
01:11:24,999 --> 01:11:27,999
... by myself in bed,
drinking or staring at the ceiling.

880
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,640
From Marina, in Modena,
there was no news.

881
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:34,678
Instead, the one person who
left forever was Cherè.

882
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:37,679
She appeared suddenly to tell me
as much on one afternoon in April..

883
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:41,079
She invited all of us
to a farewell celebration.

884
01:11:41,479 --> 01:11:44,479
But in those days nothing
and nobody interested me.

885
01:11:44,959 --> 01:11:47,679
I barely even remember the day Elsa
gave me the big news...

886
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:50,680
... in secret, that Fedora was
expecting Alberto's child.

887
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:56,760
- What time is Alberto picking you up?
- At half past 11.

888
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,559
She's always been an odd one,
that Countess Cherè!

889
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,599
A party at midnight!

890
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,600
- Do you want a coffee?
- No, Mother.

891
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,118
Fedora, what's wrong?

892
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:11,119
You'll see, everything will turn out fine.
I'm sure that Alberto will marry you.

893
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:14,718
- That's not it, Mother.
- Then what is it?

894
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:17,719
- It's not working, I don't love him anymore.
- Fedora, are you crazy?

895
01:12:18,199 --> 01:12:20,438
You have to be crazy to
not love a person anymore?

896
01:12:20,439 --> 01:12:23,438
Fedora, but in your situation...
You don't know what you're saying!

897
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:25,719
Why? Because of all the material
things I would lose?

898
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,718
The Ferrari? The mansion? The butler?

899
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:32,199
Or is it because of the scandal?
What the people would think...

900
01:12:32,799 --> 01:12:35,799
You don't care about me!
It doesn't matter to you whether I'm happy or not!

901
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:38,718
But love isn't everything, Fedora!

902
01:12:38,719 --> 01:12:41,439
What do you think, that your father
didn't love me before he left?

903
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,438
Exactly, because now I've turned
into your sick revenge fantasy.

904
01:12:43,879 --> 01:12:46,879
Your daughter can marry the richest,
the most powerful, the most desirable.

905
01:12:48,559 --> 01:12:50,838
You can make the entire town jealous...

906
01:12:50,839 --> 01:12:53,118
... all those who mocked and scorned you...

907
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:55,478
... when he left us!

908
01:12:55,479 --> 01:12:58,479
Look, it's useless.
Besides, Alberto won't marry me and I...

909
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:01,719
But instead of waiting for him to ask,
why don't you ask him?

910
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,800
Mother... Mother, why won't you help me?

911
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,518
Do you think it would be easy...
easy to surrender to that life...

912
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:17,200
... now that I've been with them,
that I've lived it myself?

913
01:13:18,279 --> 01:13:21,118
It's the misery,
the indifference of people...

914
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:23,718
Do you think that we haven't
suffered enough, in this house?

915
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:25,758
My darling, then what...

916
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:28,759
Then there must be something else in life, no?

917
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:35,159
You won't help me, Mother.
You don't know how to.

918
01:13:36,839 --> 01:13:39,839
You don't even know what you're talking about.

919
01:13:40,639 --> 01:13:43,639
Anyway, it's over with Alberto.
I'll tell him this evening.

920
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,878
Mother, we're in the sixties!
People are going to the Moon!

921
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:49,918
And you think that the same
thing wouldn't happen on the Moon?

922
01:13:49,919 --> 01:13:52,118
If there was a town like ours,
it would happen for sure.

923
01:13:52,119 --> 01:13:55,078
- Offer her some money.
- No, Alberto.

924
01:13:55,079 --> 01:13:58,079
- How can you be so sure that...
- Tests.

925
01:13:59,599 --> 01:14:01,959
Her mother had a bag full of papers.

926
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:04,960
Mother, there are many ways
to avoid having a child, aren't there?

927
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:08,119
Alberto, I wasn't born yesterday,
and neither was...

928
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,118
... the girl's mother.
You know, a scandal right now...

929
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,679
... with the new contract, the dispute
that we're having with those left wingers...

930
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,559
... your father...
you understand, don't you?

931
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,560
There's nothing else to do, Alberto.
At this point, you must marry her.

932
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:24,080
Yes, I'll marry her. Of course.

933
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,240
That way we don't risk losing the contract.
And then?

934
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,800
Then I'll sell the Ferrari,
change my ways, become serious.

935
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:35,280
And I'll be careful not to have too many lovers,
to avoid any scandals.

936
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,960
That's all it is, isn't it?
Everything to be a young businessman.

937
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,479
- Hi.
- Congratulations.

938
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:11,919
- For what?
- You've done it, haven't you?

939
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,159
Done what?

940
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:17,160
Blackmail from the mouth,
tears on the handkerchief.

941
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:20,560
Your mother will be pleased, she'll
have everything she's ever dreamed of.

942
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,519
A resounding success.

943
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:25,520
- My mother? What are you saying?
- Yes, you don't know anything.

944
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,359
Your mother didn't know anything.
Nobody knows anything.

945
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:31,360
Everything has happened thanks
to the work and grace of the Holy Spirit.

946
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:34,159
Only that, if we're going to be together...

947
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:37,160
... you could have quite easily
told me about the baby...

948
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:40,960
Not kept it hidden,
like some kind of secret weapon.

949
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,679
Come in, guys!
Make yourselves at home.

950
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,839
- Hi!
- You look wonderful!

951
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,239
Thank you!

952
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:58,240
You look good!
I've never seen you like this.

953
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,320
Then look while you still can,
it'll be the last time.

954
01:16:08,359 --> 01:16:11,359
Thank you for coming.

955
01:16:12,959 --> 01:16:15,959
Hello, Cherè.

956
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:20,359
Excellent!
This is enough drink for the entire town!

957
01:16:24,879 --> 01:16:27,118
And the servant?
You've sent her away?

958
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:29,518
Yes, she left for the
country this morning.

959
01:16:29,519 --> 01:16:32,478
It's better this way, much more intimate.

960
01:16:32,479 --> 01:16:35,479
- And you? Tomorrow?
- Yes, tomorrow morning at 7.

961
01:16:35,559 --> 01:16:38,559
- I won't even bother sleeping.
- You've decided on England?

962
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:42,359
No, Mexico. A long trip to Mexico.

963
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:46,199
These days, with the new jet planes,
you can get there from Rome in 11 hours.

964
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:50,679
Mexico... that sounds wonderful, Cherè!

965
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:59,959
Marina! I didn't expect you to come.

966
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:03,918
- Thank you.
- You came to welcome me back...

967
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:06,878
... when I came home, I'm coming to
say farewell as you're leaving.

968
01:17:06,879 --> 01:17:09,879
They're beautiful.
Right, I'll put them in water right away.

969
01:17:13,079 --> 01:17:15,398
- Hi, Anselmo.
- Well?

970
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:18,399
You've already abandoned your
proletariat life with the farmers?

971
01:17:18,959 --> 01:17:21,959
Just for a while.
Enough time to say goodbye to our runaway.

972
01:17:26,279 --> 01:17:29,279
- Elsa!
- Marina, darling!

973
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:32,998
- See? I came.
- Oh, of course!

974
01:17:32,999 --> 01:17:35,998
You don't remember the doctor,
your saviour...

975
01:17:35,999 --> 01:17:38,999
... we all remember his slap!
- The famous doctor!

976
01:17:39,999 --> 01:17:42,958
You've no idea how thankful I am.
I looked for you, after I came home.

977
01:17:42,959 --> 01:17:45,959
- You seem to have recovered well.
- Perfectly.

978
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:49,679
Have you seen those before and after adverts?

979
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:54,199
Marina is a walking advert. That's right.

980
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:57,239
She's recovered so well that you
can't even recognise her anymore.

981
01:17:57,639 --> 01:17:59,518
That depends on the
memory of who's looking.

982
01:17:59,519 --> 01:18:01,518
Or on the size of the
fortune that's inherited.

983
01:18:01,519 --> 01:18:04,519
Cured or not, Marina looks
beautiful this evening.

984
01:18:04,599 --> 01:18:07,358
Now, tell us what it's like in Modena.

985
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:09,638
Nothing special.
Just a bit bigger than this town.

986
01:18:09,639 --> 01:18:12,438
Oh, excuse me!

987
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:15,038
- So, you've changed town?
- Yes.

988
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:17,839
- Hi, Cherè.
- Hi.

989
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:20,840
- Guglielmo is here, too!
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

990
01:18:22,119 --> 01:18:25,119
Looks like the doctor is here, too.

991
01:18:31,479 --> 01:18:34,479
Well, cat got your tongue?

992
01:18:35,399 --> 01:18:38,158
- Hi, Elsa.
- Hi.

993
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:40,918
You're Fedora? Hi, I'm Marina.

994
01:18:40,919 --> 01:18:43,158
- Marina?
- Is something wrong?

995
01:18:43,159 --> 01:18:46,159
I'm sorry, Marina.
I've heard a lot about you.

996
01:18:46,399 --> 01:18:49,399
- Even though we've never met.
- Hi, Fedora.

997
01:18:56,959 --> 01:18:59,638
- You know my wife?
- Your wife?!

998
01:18:59,639 --> 01:19:02,639
It's the big news of the evening,
I plan on marrying her very soon.

999
01:19:03,519 --> 01:19:06,358
- Come on, show them! That's it!
- Alberto, stop it!

1000
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:09,359
Ladies and Gentlemen,
the Marchioness De Matteis!

1001
01:19:09,759 --> 01:19:09,759
- Well, nobody has anything to say?
- The Marquis is dead...

1002
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,438
... long live the Marchioness!
- That's wonderful news!

1003
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:18,439
- Congratulations!
- More like: the award for bravery.

1004
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:21,879
Then the first present is for Fedora. Come on.

1005
01:19:22,639 --> 01:19:25,639
- What do you mean, the first present?
- Happy?

1006
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:28,118
- Yes.
- What presents, Cherè?

1007
01:19:28,119 --> 01:19:30,518
I couldn't leave just like that, could I?
There are farewell presents.

1008
01:19:30,519 --> 01:19:33,519
Farewell, my darling, farewell...

1009
01:19:33,599 --> 01:19:36,599
- You're such an idiot!
- And idiot, yes, but a patriotic one.

1010
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:39,078
Cherè always has the most wonderful
ideas, doesn't she?

1011
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:41,678
- More like: the power of tradition.
- Santini, Fedora! Here you are.

1012
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:44,679
- Enough, that's your third glass.
- Thank you.

1013
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:47,680
- Foresi, Anselmo!
- Yes.

1014
01:19:50,799 --> 01:19:53,799
Foresi, Elsa!

1015
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:01,399
- Bodoni, Guglielmo!
- Here I am.

1016
01:20:02,799 --> 01:20:05,799
Well, Anselmo?

1017
01:20:07,079 --> 01:20:10,079
- Nothing. You're here?
- Evidently.

1018
01:20:10,839 --> 01:20:13,118
Castelfranco, Marina!
I give to you my bracelet.

1019
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:15,118
I didn't think you would come.

1020
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:18,119
Yes. Thank you, it's very beautiful.

1021
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:22,359
Corsi, Mario!

1022
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,280
De Matteis, Alberto!

1023
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,679
Thank you.

1024
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:39,519
- This is yours.
- And now it's yours.

1025
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,520
- No, I don't want it.
- Why?

1026
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:46,080
I don't want it...

1027
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:52,280
Cherè, 20 volumes?
You shouldn't have!

1028
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,880
There are lots of volumes missing.
You can find the rest if you go to Paris.

1029
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,118
A table clock, just what I always wanted!

1030
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:03,759
It's a classic gift
for a young businessman.

1031
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,760
I heard that you're going to work
for a firm, with your father.

1032
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:10,200
With my father, with my mother,
with my brother...

1033
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,200
... and with my wife.
Just what I've always dreamed of, no?

1034
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,119
Half a medal?

1035
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:23,120
Have you never read any fairytales?

1036
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:26,240
I have the other half,
that way, one day...

1037
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,519
... we can be reunited on a deserted island...

1038
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,559
... or in an enchanted castle.

1039
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:36,200
With our fates written in the heavens...

1040
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:02,719
Hold on a moment.
This way we have more room.

1041
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:05,720
Isn't he a darling?
He thinks of everything, doesn't he?

1042
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,920
What are you doing, dancing on your own?

1043
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:20,560
Shall we dance?

1044
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,760
Come on, let's dance...

1045
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:36,160
Listen, Mario...

1046
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:39,678
Can you stick around later?
I need to talk to someone.

1047
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:44,160
With you. There are things that
I couldn't say to anyone else.

1048
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,359
Ah, I see we've become quite
the dashing young man...

1049
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:53,358
Amateur ballerina,
professional businessman.

1050
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:56,359
You don't speak often, but when you do...

1051
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,520
What's wrong with you? Stop it!

1052
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,880
Enough! Enough!

1053
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:05,440
- Enough, Alberto! Get away from me!
- Now you don't want to, eh?

1054
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:08,559
Now you don't want to?!

1055
01:24:19,640 --> 01:24:22,640
Doctor Corsi!

1056
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:31,640
Kiss her!

1057
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:35,120
You have my permission, go on!

1058
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:54,120
My God, how disgusting!
Don't you realise how disgusting you are?

1059
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:10,880
See that? The Countess
is still running after him.

1060
01:26:14,160 --> 01:26:17,160
I'd say that Fedora's kiss
must have made him lose his head.

1061
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,479
Must be a middle class thing.

1062
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:23,480
- Where's Fedora gone, has she left?
- Fedora will be back, don't worry.

1063
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:32,080
What are these for?

1064
01:26:39,079 --> 01:26:42,079
What is there to say, Cherè?

1065
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:49,280
Let's leave it at half-medals.

1066
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,639
Guys, look at this! It's empty!

1067
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:27,119
Cherè, you don't have any furniture,
what have you done?

1068
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:30,120
I can explain everything,
let's just go back to the lounge.

1069
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,520
- Guys, it's empty through here as well!
- The only thing left to sell is the wallpaper.

1070
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,359
- Come on, quick!
- Just a moment!

1071
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:41,360
What are you doing? Please, wait,
why don't you go back to the lounge?

1072
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:45,199
Who do you think you are? Let go of me!
Quick, Guglielmo, come on!

1073
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:48,200
Hey, this must be the family Chapel!

1074
01:27:50,319 --> 01:27:53,319
- Wow, it's not bad!
- Elsa! Elsa, where are you?

1075
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,880
- Where are the others?
- It seems they're on a treasure hunt!

1076
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:02,559
Quick, come with me.

1077
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,560
No, this way! Hey, everyone this way!

1078
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,080
Ecce domus Veneris!

1079
01:28:19,399 --> 01:28:21,759
This looks like the end of the world!

1080
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,719
Only the bed hasn't been sold!

1081
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:26,720
- Marina, what are those?
- They're all bills to pay!

1082
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:29,559
Creme Rubinstein, Christian Dior...

1083
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:32,560
Christian Dior, hairdresser,
whisky... more whisky!

1084
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:36,880
Even the car wasn't hers,
do you know whose it was?

1085
01:28:37,079 --> 01:28:40,079
... Ridolfi's.
- Guys, the party's over!

1086
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:44,280
- Look at this.
- Margherita Cherè, foreclosed.

1087
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:49,118
Ridolfi's name is here as well.
So that's why you wanted to marry him, eh?

1088
01:28:49,119 --> 01:28:51,819
Cherè, how could you do such a thing?
Why not just move out and rent the place...

1089
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Actually, I like it.

1090
01:28:55,919 --> 01:28:58,919
You don't understand anything.
Well done, very well done!

1091
01:28:59,319 --> 01:29:01,718
She wanted to live the life for a day.

1092
01:29:01,719 --> 01:29:03,998
Countess Cherè, we will dedicate
a monument to your memory.

1093
01:29:03,999 --> 01:29:06,518
You fooled us all. You were poor...

1094
01:29:06,519 --> 01:29:08,518
... without a penny,
in the hands of the loan sharks!

1095
01:29:08,519 --> 01:29:11,519
And we loved your class,
envied your trips to Mexico!

1096
01:29:22,799 --> 01:29:25,799
Come on, Cherè! Come on!
Now, I'll give you some money...

1097
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:29,438
... and my father will sort out the rest.
Happy?

1098
01:29:29,439 --> 01:29:31,759
Isn't that right, guys,
what is it that's written in the Bible...

1099
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,758
... that we must feed the hungry?

1100
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:37,719
Out.

1101
01:29:41,239 --> 01:29:44,239
Out!

1102
01:29:52,359 --> 01:29:55,359
- These are no manners for a Countess, you know.
- Out, I said.

1103
01:29:57,319 --> 01:30:00,319
We're going, we're going.

1104
01:30:01,559 --> 01:30:04,559
Well done.

1105
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:14,158
Let's go, guys.
Leave the presents behind.

1106
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:17,159
They might be useful in Mexico.

1107
01:30:22,879 --> 01:30:25,278
Only the lounge was maintained!

1108
01:30:25,279 --> 01:30:28,238
For the farewell celebration!

1109
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:31,239
Anselmo? Anselmo!

1110
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,798
Go on. What are you waiting for?

1111
01:30:38,799 --> 01:30:41,799
- I need to let some air in here.
- Anselmo, let's go! Hurry up!

1112
01:31:31,759 --> 01:31:34,759
Do you remember when you told me about
the Dauphins, that first night?

1113
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:39,719
Perhaps that's why I was afraid
when you started seeing him.

1114
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:43,238
It wasn't just jealousy.

1115
01:31:43,239 --> 01:31:46,239
I was afraid that you... I don't know...
That you would change.

1116
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:52,359
Change inside, I mean. Do you see?

1117
01:31:53,799 --> 01:31:56,799
It seemed impossible that I would
ever see you again as you were before.

1118
01:31:57,119 --> 01:31:59,118
What's wrong?

1119
01:31:59,119 --> 01:32:02,118
Everything you're saying is so beautiful,
so right...

1120
01:32:02,119 --> 01:32:04,318
Then what is it, Fedora?

1121
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:07,319
Nothing, Mario.
I'm not the same as I was before.

1122
01:32:07,959 --> 01:32:10,959
It's like I don't have the strength anymore,
that I don't know the difference...

1123
01:32:10,999 --> 01:32:13,478
... between right and wrong!
- What are you saying, Fedora?

1124
01:32:13,479 --> 01:32:16,198
You love me, don't you?
You know that you love me.

1125
01:32:16,199 --> 01:32:19,199
Of course, Mario. Of course.

1126
01:32:20,879 --> 01:32:23,879
Then look at me.
We have our whole lives ahead of us.

1127
01:32:25,119 --> 01:32:28,119
You and I. And this time nothing
and no one can stop us.

1128
01:32:31,399 --> 01:32:34,399
Yes, Mario. Yes.

1129
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:39,079
I want to scream it from the rooftops.
In fact, want me to start now?

1130
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,958
Fedora and I are getting married!

1131
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:46,279
Fedora and I are...

1132
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:16,199
Now, go and get some sleep,
you're so tired.

1133
01:33:26,359 --> 01:33:29,359
We'll meet up later on,
at midday, at the Meletti.

1134
01:33:31,079 --> 01:33:34,079
Yes, at the Meletti.
In front of the whole town.

1135
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:37,479
There's no need to hide ourselves.

1136
01:33:38,159 --> 01:33:41,159
We can go in with our heads raised high.
Understand?

1137
01:33:42,679 --> 01:33:45,679
Yes, Mario.

1138
01:33:49,959 --> 01:33:52,959
See you at midday, then.

1139
01:34:59,719 --> 01:35:02,719
Mother, what are you doing there?

1140
01:35:06,479 --> 01:35:09,479
Nothing, Fedora. Nothing, I'm ill.

1141
01:35:11,079 --> 01:35:14,079
I've been thinking all night.

1142
01:35:14,679 --> 01:35:17,679
I've done everything wrong, even with you.

1143
01:35:17,719 --> 01:35:20,719
And I just won't survive another scandal!

1144
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:45,639
Mother, please...

1145
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:52,439
Don't cry.

1146
01:36:25,159 --> 01:36:28,159
Hi, Fedora.

1147
01:36:45,479 --> 01:36:48,479
Well, you're not going to offer me a drink?

1148
01:36:51,479 --> 01:36:54,479
Sure.

1149
01:36:56,359 --> 01:36:59,318
- What would you like?
- One Pernod.

1150
01:36:59,319 --> 01:37:02,238
Hey, a Pernod!

1151
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:05,158
For the honeymoon we'll go
and visit our paper mill first...

1152
01:37:05,159 --> 01:37:07,838
... and then on to Salsomaggiore,
for the ping-pong championships.

1153
01:37:07,839 --> 01:37:10,839
Sounds like a wonderful plan...
Did you hear that, Ridolfi?

1154
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:17,918
The world is yours.

1155
01:37:30,359 --> 01:37:33,358
Well done, Marina, cure my Anselmo.

1156
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:35,958
You'll realise what a difficult character
he is, when you're together again.

1157
01:37:35,959 --> 01:37:38,959
Anselmo, did you hear what your
mother just said? Anselmo?

1158
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:43,719
I speaking to Marina about your nature.
You can be hard work, sometimes.

1159
01:37:44,879 --> 01:37:47,879
Yes, yes...

1160
01:37:53,079 --> 01:37:56,079
Here we are. Winter is over.

1161
01:37:56,959 --> 01:37:59,318
Everything is settled.

1162
01:37:59,319 --> 01:38:02,319
By the window at the Meletti,
we've lost Cherè and gained Fedora.

1163
01:38:03,919 --> 01:38:06,678
People go about their Sunday walks.

1164
01:38:06,679 --> 01:38:09,679
Everything goes on as it was before,
as it's supposed to.

1165
01:38:13,599 --> 01:38:16,599
What is left of that winter?

1166
01:38:16,919 --> 01:38:19,919
In all these sleepless nights...

1167
01:38:20,119 --> 01:38:23,119
... I've forced myself to relive that time
in order to understand what happened inside us...

1168
01:38:23,519 --> 01:38:26,519
... how it changed us.
And now that it's over, I don't know...

1169
01:38:28,519 --> 01:38:31,519
... everything seems so far away,
so difficult to recall.

1170
01:38:33,399 --> 01:38:35,678
Perhaps my father is right...

1171
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:38,679
... we were children, and now we've grown up.

1172
01:38:39,639 --> 01:38:42,639
... or perhaps, in some way or another,
we were alive before...

1173
01:38:44,079 --> 01:38:47,079
... and now we're not, we've surrendered.

1174
01:38:48,759 --> 01:38:51,238
A week from now I shall marry Marina...

1175
01:38:51,239 --> 01:38:53,638
... and her land, which stretches
as far as the eye can see.

1176
01:38:53,639 --> 01:38:56,118
The ceremony will be celebrated
with the usual feast...

1177
01:38:56,119 --> 01:38:58,798
... in the Cathedral on the main square,
where my sister got married...

1178
01:38:58,799 --> 01:39:01,799
... as well as Alberto and Fedora.

1179
01:39:02,279 --> 01:39:06,278
... and now I must go, it's late.
I have to be at work by 8 in the morning.
