1
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,560
'Now we have a news alert
coming in at this hour…'

2
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,080
'from West Bengal's Purulia district…'

3
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,640
'A short while ago,
a bomb exploded...'

4
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,840
'in the convoy of cars,
passing through a village.'

5
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,640
'Number dead or injured,
are yet unconfirmed. '

6
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,240
'As per sources, van has been stolen.'

7
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,200
'And it may be a land-mine blast.'

8
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,840
'We are getting fresh
reports to keep you updated. '

9
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,960
'Do stay with us.'

10
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,120
Sir, we want to
report a missing case.

11
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,000
We are tired running
from pillar to post

12
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,320
Every police station says,
it's not under their jurisdiction.

13
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,960
We're very upset.
Sir, if you could...

14
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,600
Name?

15
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,720
Ishan Bharti.

16
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,880
Age?

17
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,280
26 years, approximately.

18
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,520
How is he related to you?

19
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,520
He is my brother.

20
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,120
Your name?

21
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,000
Namita.

22
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,680
Namita…

23
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,760
Bharti!

24
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,560
It’s Yadav…

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,960
He is my husband.

26
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,040
Aman Yadav.

27
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,840
What does your brother do?

28
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,720
He is a graduate in Political Science,
from Maulana Azad College.

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,960
Is he a student?

30
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,680
No, he is a theatre artist.

31
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,240
Oh, you mean unemployed, right?

32
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,280
Address?

33
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,240
2/137 A, Jhama Pukur Lane,

34
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,480
Amherst Street, Kolkata - 9.

35
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,880
He is missing since last two weeks.

36
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,440
Last when I tried calling him,
his phone rang...

37
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,040
... but he didn’t answer my call.

38
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,480
His phone is switched off since then.

39
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,520
Is he into drugs, or any substance?

40
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,560
No, not at all.

41
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,880
He is a street theatre artist...

42
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,040
so has to travel places
but he is not into drugs.

43
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,840
And... any girl related issues?

44
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,000
Err, Ankita Chauhan,

45
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,880
she's his friend,

46
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,600
a very decent girl.

47
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,400
We don’t have her contact details though.

48
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,160
Do you suspect anyone?

49
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,880
- Anyone you know, who intends
to cause any harm to him?

50
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,560
Thank you so much.

51
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,400
- Yes, ma’am.
- May I take a call please?

52
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,520
Yes, ma’am.
Good night.

53
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,240
Sure!

54
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,000
I know this,
and also, Kunal believes,

55
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,720
you are quite sharp at
sniffing important stories.

56
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,320
Varman is a heavy weight.

57
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,960
I know you won’t be
swayed by rumors.

58
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,560
Unless you have proof
of his involvement,

59
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,120
you will not write anything
against him.

60
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,200
that can later attract a
defamation lawsuit against us.

61
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,800
Exactly!

62
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,960
Okay?

63
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,000
Mr. Ranjan Varman,

64
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,720
thank you so much for
being our guest...

65
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,520
and for handling all uncomfortable
questions with such aplomb.

66
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,520
We’ll see you again next saturday,
on ‘Khaas Mulakat’.

67
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,920
Stay tuned to Metro News.

68
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,960
(Next station is Netaji Bhavan.)

69
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,960
That night, at the police station,

70
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,040
I didn’t realize, Namita,
or this story,

71
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,640
would become
so important to me.

72
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,280
I am time the eternal...

73
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,000
Hmm.

74
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,480
The destroyer of all people
at all levels of existence.

75
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,200
Even if you don’t act,

76
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,400
your opponents will disappear
in the near future.

77
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,480
Whatever is destined...

78
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,520
… can’t be changed.

79
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,600
Now explain why were
you late last night.

80
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,120
War!

81
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,520
Who was your poor opponent?

82
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,320
Kunal Da!

83
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,680
- Kunal?
- Yeah!

84
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,640
Why?

85
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,520
He feels I may get targeted.

86
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,240
I have no clue.

87
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,640
This is just a story.

88
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,680
What’s to worry about?

89
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,960
A story of someone 'missing'.
A boy who is lost.

90
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,240
So?

91
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,040
No!

92
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,720
It’s not just a story
about a boy who is lost.

93
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,960
In fact, to start with,
it’s a love story.

94
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,640
Come on, aren’t love stories
supposed to have romance, etc.

95
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,480
Will you allow me
to narrate first?

96
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,160
Before jumping to
conclusions, as always.

97
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,920
Ishan Bharti…

98
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,800
Crazy about theatre...

99
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,120
and a girl, called Ankita.

100
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,360
He was never into practicality
or any mundane things.

101
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,440
According to his friends,

102
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,280
Ankita loved him for what he was,

103
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,680
which also scared her
for the same reasons.

104
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,880
Let's try something new?

105
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,040
My salary is delayed again.

106
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
I really don't know how
long this channel will last.

107
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Great, atleast one hate
factory will shut down.

108
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,520
Why don't you find some work?

109
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,160
Mere love can't run a kitchen.

110
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,560
I came from a UP government

111
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,680
school, and got till here...

112
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,880
I don’t want to struggle all my life.

113
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,600
I need to speak to my
parents about us.

114
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,680
Hearing "Ishan Bharti", your folks
won't know what hit them...

115
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,920
...it won't matter if the boy's a
shopkeeper or an artist.

116
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,680
We'll have to elope and marry.

117
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,520
What say?

118
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,120
Hey...

119
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,640
Hey, come…

120
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,480
...let’s go now to
the marriage registrar’s office.

121
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,400
Okay, I am game.

122
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,800
Are you sure?

123
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,120
Yes, of course.

124
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,320
Brother, cheque please.

125
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,240
She is Ankita Chauhan,

126
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,360
one of our brightest anchors.

127
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,960
Please sit.

128
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,880
There's something about you...

129
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,040
… you hit us hard with
your sugar-coated questions.

130
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,320
rest of the anchors ask
mundane questions,

131
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,480
but act like they are
pelting stones at us.

132
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,800
May I have your number please?

133
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,000
Hello.

134
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,280
Ankita ma’am?

135
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,920
Mr. Varman wants to talk to you.

136
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,920
There is something I wanted
to speak to you about.

137
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,080
It’s a job offer.

138
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,400
Ankita is quite ambitious.

139
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,600
Although her channel
is small...

140
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,960
... and also, on the
verge of shutting down.

141
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,840
So, should I stop?

142
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,520
You always interrupt
my story, Nanu (Grandpa).

143
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,400
Let me explain,

144
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,520
A child is the father of a man.

145
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
In this case,
you are the father; I am the child.

146
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,680
Nanu!

147
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,600
Hi!

148
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,520
How’s the new job going?

149
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,800
Good sir.

150
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,280
I heard you are
very hard working...

151
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,880
I have a gift for you.

152
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,400
Sure sir.

153
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,440
So where would you like to go?
Darjeeling or Goa?

154
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,560
Hmm.

155
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,400
That can be arranged.

156
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,720
Ishan,

157
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,240
I need this job badly.

158
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,720
I promise to not stress
you out with anything.

159
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,120
I know theatre is your life.

160
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,920
Let’s be selfish for a change.

161
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,640
You can discreetly
come over to my flat,

162
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,240
I don’t see any problem.

163
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,600
Sent you my address.

164
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,840
Whenever you visit me,

165
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,800
just don’t make any entry
in the security register.

166
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,880
Can you really
afford this place?

167
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,200
It's that groom, whose
on his “funeral” procession.

168
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,320
Why do you look so sad?

169
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,480
Is it about some woman?

170
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,040
Who the hell are you guys?

171
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,040
Don’t bother me.

172
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,480
We're bothering you?

173
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,920
You seem to be a nice guy,
so, we are just sharing some advise.

174
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,920
When your girl is
beyond your league...

175
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,000
... you should stop calling her.

176
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,640
Absolutely...

177
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,760
Else,

178
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,640
You won’t be riding a horse like this,
rather it’ll be your funeral procession.

179
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,320
I speak from experience.

180
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,440
Quite experienced, huh?

181
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,440
Yes of course.

182
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,280
When did you learn
about the threats to Ishan?

183
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,680
I heard it from Namita.

184
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,920
Rest... we don’t reveal
our sources, Nanu.

185
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,840
Okay, okay...
go ahead.

186
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,720
Nothing, I had to stop.

187
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,560
Kunal sir, asked me to
terminate my investigations.

188
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,520
He feels it’s dangerous.

189
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,880
Despite getting threat warnings,
Ishan didn’t back out.

190
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,560
And you know
what happened...

191
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,760
Actually, we don’t
know what happened.

192
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,680
What happened?

193
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,240
What’s wrong?

194
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,880
WHAT’S WRONG?

195
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,680
You tell me.

196
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,080
You were the hot shot
anchor at a news channel.

197
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,400
What’s wrong?

198
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,440
Theatre is good to issue
public service messages.

199
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,040
In real life,

200
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,120
one has to use
strategies to survive...

201
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,040
And even more
if you are a woman.

202
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,200
Grow up Ishan!

203
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,920
Grow up?

204
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,760
Ankita, this isn’t growing up.

205
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,160
It’s something else.

206
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,520
Hey what did you say?

207
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,160
How dare you?

208
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,360
Listen, I am running little late.

209
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,280
I have to go to ‘Lal Bazar’.

210
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,320
And that was the last
time when anyone saw Ishan.

211
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,200
Ouch.

212
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,360
Mind your step.

213
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,960
Where does Ishan live?

214
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,000
Jhama Pukur Lane, Amherst Street

215
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,600
Are you sure that,
this is going to be,

216
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,480
like you quite often say,

217
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,400
A micro to, macro exploration.

218
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,120
“Bindu mein Sindhu”, (Single
droplet contains the entire ocean.)

219
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,280
As you Bong say.

220
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,240
All the best, mad cap.

221
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,360
We will wait for the Sindhu,
the bigger picture.

222
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,760
Always the bigger picture.

223
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,520
Namita?

224
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,640
We spoke on phone
sometime back.

225
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,640
Vidhi?

226
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,640
- Ishan’s room?
- Yes.

227
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,520
May I?

228
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,280
My mother...

229
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,880
I am sure you know...

230
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,520
... how stressed she is...

231
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,000
Ma!

232
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,200
Ma!

233
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,160
Please sit.

234
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,640
Are the cops troubling
you ma’am?

235
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,520
Yeah!

236
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,000
It all started right after we
filed the missing report.

237
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,760
Just a minute.
Can I record this please?

238
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,480
Yes.

239
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,040
Sure, thank you.

240
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,960
The cops landed at my,
mom’s house the very next day.

241
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,240
Interrogation is just an
excuse for torturing us.

242
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,560
They just want to silence us.

243
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,120
Mom’s health deteriorated.

244
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,960
I asked permission from my in-laws
and rushed here.

245
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,080
I was here.

246
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,200
But next day, police came knocking
to my in-laws place too.

247
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,720
Did he get a passport made?

248
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
What?

249
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,920
I asked did he have a passport?

250
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
No.

251
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,880
Did Ishan ever
visit Nepal or China?

252
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,760
Did you know,

253
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,040
your brother Ishan had
links with an extremist group.

254
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
We were not aware.

255
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,160
Any group...

256
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,720
or party you know of?

257
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,000
No, he was only a street theatre artist.

258
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,600
- that would keep him busy...
- Andhra...

259
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,000
Maharashtra, Jharkhand...

260
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,640
He has visited all these
Maoist areas.

261
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,160
Show them the pictures.

262
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,400
Look carefully,
do you know this man?

263
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,160
Of course, I have seen
him in the newspapers.

264
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,360
Err... that’s how I meant;
I know him.

265
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,840
Have you heard of ‘PLUG’?

266
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,880
People’s...

267
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,960
Liberation...

268
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,400
Underground Group.

269
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,000
We have found the minutes...

270
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,640
of a meeting of this group,
from his room.

271
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,320
Ishan was never
interested in active politics.

272
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,720
He was happy
with his street theatre.

273
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,560
Cops kept bringing up this same topic.

274
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,320
But when I informed them
about Ankita and Ishan’s relation.

275
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,680
They turned deaf to me.

276
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,560
They didn’t give a damn about it.

277
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,680
You look so pale
and famished.

278
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,800
Eat something dear.

279
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
You are right,

280
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,440
I am pulling on, with just
a cup coffee and tea.

281
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,760
You expose quite influential
people through your stories.

282
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,280
Don't you feel scared?

283
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,920
If I get scared,
I'll have to quit my job.

284
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,760
Are you married?

285
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,480
No!

286
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,920
I got married
didn't I maa?

287
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,280
The one who should protect
instills more fear in me.

288
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,360
"Don't do this", "don't do that",
"don't wear those clothes".

289
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,280
He has made a whole list of people
I should stay away from.

290
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,480
I believe husbands,

291
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,680
see no difference between

292
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,200
expressing love and advice.

293
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,560
Love, according to them,
is all about dominating their wife.

294
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,400
You won’t believe,

295
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,240
I learnt this fact from a man.

296
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,560
From my brother.

297
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,920
Ishan.

298
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,720
Okay...

299
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,280
Just move a little.

300
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:04,960
More.

301
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,960
Smile please.

302
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,600
Yes, a bit more.

303
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,680
Today is the anniversary
of a messy divorce.

304
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,240
Let’s celebrate together.

305
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,400
Boss, freedom should
always be celebrated.

306
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,160
But boss, I am busy.

307
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,320
I am sorry, I really wish I could.

308
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,000
So what’s this new scoop about?

309
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,520
You had a closed-door
meeting with the chief as well.

310
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,280
Ping me if you need any help?

311
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,040
Yes, tell me.

312
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,480
What can I do for you?

313
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,520
I know you won’t
call me otherwise.

314
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,520
Listen, I don’t want to
fight any more.

315
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,800
I am tired of this
long-distance relationship.

316
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,080
Let’s meet up and
sort this problem once for all.

317
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,200
Jeet, I have told
you several times.

318
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,960
I can’t relocate to
Mumbai just for you.

319
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,640
So please stop insisting.

320
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,760
So are you not
interested in meeting me?

321
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,440
Obviously, I miss you.

322
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,480
But I have something important,

323
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,600
and I can’t quit or take a break.

324
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,640
So, I don’t know
what more to say.

325
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,400
How about having
lunch together?

326
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,200
Two PM?
Flurys?

327
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:13,960
What?

328
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,840
Yes!

329
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,560
I just landed in Koklata,

330
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,560
we are setting up a new
office in the eastern zone.

331
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,880
Oh God, I wish I could
meet you right away.

332
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,560
Okay, I have an
appointment now.

333
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,360
How about catching
up in the evening?

334
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,960
That's all I ask...

335
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,440
Okay, bye...

336
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,480
See you.

337
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,000
- I know... I know...
- Where is Datto sir?

338
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,600
Sir,

339
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,280
Yes…

340
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,880
Ma’am, it’s no longer in my control now.

341
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,680
Even after our preliminary enquiry,

342
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,920
we failed to ascertain if this boy
is absconding or missing.

343
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,440
He would’ve fled had
he committed a crime.

344
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,640
Ishan has no criminal record.

345
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,200
I have confirmed this.

346
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,800
This case is going
to blow up soon.

347
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,920
Jantantrik Party’s MLA,
Mr. Umashankar Mukherjee called up OC sir,

348
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,840
he was quite curious
about this case.

349
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,360
And you think it’s not important
to interrogate Ankita Chauhan?

350
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,680
We have been advised
not to disturb her.

351
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,560
And you won't be able to name

352
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,240
whose advise this was, right?

353
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,320
Thank you.

354
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,240
[SET FREE]

355
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,760
Do not hesitate…

356
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,120
Your situation will never improve.

357
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,840
Nothing will change.

358
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,080
Kushal’s phone is switched off.

359
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,920
What’s going on?
where is he?

360
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,720
Kushal Da has stopped coming here.

361
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,800
He was interrogated by the cops…

362
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,440
... was told not to talk to the press.

363
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,480
Do you know Ankita?

364
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,920
Ankita Chauhan?

365
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,520
Yes sure we know her…

366
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,280
but Kushal da knows
a lot more...

367
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,640
Ishan used to confide in him a lot.

368
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,120
Kushal Da is quite scared.

369
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,560
He suffers from anxiety and depression.

370
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,960
He has started drinking again.

371
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,080
We believe Ankita is responsible
for Ishan’s disappearance…

372
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,280
But, we can’t openly
accuse anyone.

373
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,000
Orijit…

374
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,880
I need to speak to Kushal da.

375
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,880
Kushal Da,

376
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,920
police are claiming Ishan
is a radical or a Maoist...

377
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,800
… with a lot of confidence.

378
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,080
It’s all bullshit.

379
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,160
He was against violence
and this so-called red revolution.

380
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,760
We faced a lot of issues
because of this.

381
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,960
I know the motive
of the special branch.

382
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,400
I agree we have staged several
shows in tribal areas.

383
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,120
Police is now trying to link us to
the Maoist presence in those areas,

384
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,800
and Ankita's involvement
is being overlooked.

385
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,160
Do you have Ankita’s
present address?

386
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,760
Here, note it down.

387
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,040
I am making some stuffed
bread for you.

388
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,320
Okay Nanu,
will eat and then leave.

389
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,800
What is this?

390
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,320
I made it for you.

391
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,800
I can see that…

392
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,560
Listen, my office revamp
will take 3 months.

393
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,160
Every fortnight, I have to
go back to Mumbai.

394
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,880
Okay, that means in 3 months,

395
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,800
- we will have 2 dozen fights.
- No, please Vidhi...

396
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,200
...I am here to end all our fights.

397
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,360
Is it!

398
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,400
Impossible, I am not buying it this time.

399
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,400
Come on, just take 2-3 days off,
we have so much to thrash out.

400
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,480
On a serious note,

401
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,360
I am working on
a very critical story.

402
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,600
Special branch…

403
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,040
has suddenly got interested…

404
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,000
… in a missing story.

405
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,800
What’s the case?

406
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,520
It’s confidential.

407
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,600
Vidhi, this is sounding
really dangerous.

408
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,400
Won't it be better,
to stay away from this?

409
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,360
What?

410
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,280
Reminded me of something, someone said.

411
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,000
Anyways.

412
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,240
Not possible.

413
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,080
I can't abandon the
story from here.

414
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,360
“The road ahead is dark and dangerous,”

415
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,920
“be careful,”

416
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,480
“while walking here.”

417
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,240
“Always be ready...
to die,”

418
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,800
“you may get killed,”

419
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,320
“or backstabbed.”

420
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,240
“Everyone here,
is playing a game.”

421
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,640
"No one can be trusted."

422
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,320
“The gamblers are on the prowl...”

423
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,080
“...playing the
dangerous game.”

424
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:42,200
"You take care oh dear,
beware, be careful."

425
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,720
I met Ishan’s mother…

426
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,720
… and she looked like,

427
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,360
a suffering angel.

428
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,720
One thing you can’t deny,

429
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,120
I cook the best
Upma and Sambhar.

430
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,120
- Right?
- Yes…

431
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,320
and one more thing…

432
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,120
since my childhood, I’ve observed,
you always cook something,

433
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
and keep fishing for
compliments the entire day.

434
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,440
These compliments
are my real earnings…

435
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,040
… and when my granddaughter
compliments me…

436
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,240
it adds a few more years to my life…

437
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,240
Aww…

438
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,920
Didi have you eaten?

439
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,200
Yes!

440
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,360
Get me a glass of water please.

441
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,800
There is one more
weird thing about you…

442
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,280
What’s that?

443
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,520
Are you really not
interested in politics?

444
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,680
This behavior in itself is political…

445
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,600
to act not to be
interested in politics.

446
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,000
But, it’s not possible to stay
completely away from politics.

447
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,440
So, if someone suddenly gets
branded, a 'Maoist'...

448
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,280
what are your thoughts on this?

449
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,520
I have issues with
all such labels…

450
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,640
Jihadi...

451
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,760
Maoist...

452
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,320
I can very well digest my food…

453
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,000
But not violence…

454
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,680
And if someone tries
to achieve a purpose…

455
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,520
violently, in the
guise of a brand name...

456
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,040
then the purpose stands defeated.

457
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,800
You hate your enemy so much...

458
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
that you eventually ape him.

459
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,840
My God!

460
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,880
Historically it is proven that,

461
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,200
this is the biggest irony,

462
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,080
and the biggest tragedy of violence.

463
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,400
But,

464
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,960
I will ask you once again,
how's the Upma?

465
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,360
I am sure it’s better
than my political views, right?

466
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,320
Yes...

467
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,080
So you want to meet
Mr. Umashankar.

468
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,920
As he is showing great
interest in this story.

469
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,800
Right?

470
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,440
Yes.

471
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,320
He was my junior
during Presidency college.

472
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,400
Poor man…

473
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,360
his honesty turned him into…

474
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,840
… the black sheep
of Bengal politics.

475
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,600
Can you really fix up a
meeting with him?

476
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,400
Where does Ankita Chauhan live?

477
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,040
Second floor, the door as
you come out of the lift.

478
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,920
'Breaking news.'

479
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,080
'A bomb exploded at
the state MLA hostel.'

480
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,640
'As you can see, minister Ranjan Varman
is being escorted to safety.'

481
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,680
'According to our sources,'

482
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,240
'Bhishm Rana has claimed
responsibility for this explosion.'

483
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,120
- I am preparing you
to serve our country.

484
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,080
And you are worried
about a lame street theatre artist?

485
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,840
Interacting with pseudo intellects will
only attract more negativity.

486
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,800
It will lead to poor decision making.

487
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,520
So, just forget it.

488
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,880
It's a request.

489
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,600
Okay?

490
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,200
Okay, sir.

491
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,240
This is the right frame what I'm looking for.

492
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,000
- So, what you have submitted here,

493
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,640
- makes complete sense to me…

494
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,160
but, Sneha what we need to concentrate
on is whenever there is a crisis,

495
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,760
that has to be our first priority

496
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,720
and it has to be our first destination.

497
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,840
Those are the places we go to first.

498
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,240
Moving on…

499
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,280
How have you been?

500
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,000
Sir, I have good news to share.

501
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,920
Jhanavi is expecting.

502
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,600
- Congratulations…
- Thank you so much sir,

503
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,400
Sir, I need your blessings.

504
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,400
Congratulations!

505
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,640
You might get a call
from ‘Daybreak’ news...

506
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,360
although I am trying
to neutralize them.

507
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,200
Their journalist, Vidhi Sahani,

508
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,280
will try to approach you.

509
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,120
Yes, she has been
calling me frequently.

510
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,640
So, why aren’t you answering her?

511
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,120
This will become an issue
for no reason.

512
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,240
Tell her everything
like you have been asked to.

513
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,240
I have a question,

514
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,760
hope it won't offend you...

515
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,760
That night, Ishan visited
my apartment.

516
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,160
He is missing since then,

517
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,080
Where is Ishan?

518
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,000
Is he alive?

519
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,360
Just needed to know this much.

520
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,480
Why are you asking
me this question?

521
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,480
I think there is
some misunderstanding.

522
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,960
Unlike what you may think, I am
not against the radical youth.

523
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,440
In fact, I look forward
to initiate youth groups,

524
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,680
in every low-income area,

525
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,720
to help these young,
disturbed people.

526
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,560
Soon I will propose
this project to our CM.

527
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,160
Let the cops do their
job of searching Ishan,

528
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,240
you have better things to do.

529
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,800
I have proposed
your name to the CM,

530
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,160
for the upcoming
municipal elections.

531
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,360
In two years,
you could become an MLA.

532
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,640
But, I have no experience in politics.

533
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,600
You have a
'Political Science' degree.

534
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,800
You were ‘General
Secretary’ in your college.

535
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,800
Isn’t that enough?

536
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,560
Yes, Nanu...

537
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,000
Pass my watch please…

538
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Your mobile?

539
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,880
yes, of course…

540
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,640
looks like you want to talk.

541
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,400
Do you feel you are being trailed?

542
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,840
Quite possible, please pass my bag.

543
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,640
Thank you…

544
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,960
Yes, we chase stories,

545
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,360
and sometimes we are chased by
people who are in those stories.

546
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,960
This cat and mouse
game goes on forever.

547
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,440
I get worried dear.

548
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,600
Why?

549
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,560
Perhaps, its age related…

550
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,240
I meant, my age…

551
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,960
Yes, I know…

552
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,720
No one who does good work,
will ever come to a bad end.

553
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,760
Straight out of Bhagwad Gita,

554
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
just for you...

555
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,320
Ah, taste of my own medicine?

556
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:27,960
Okay bye,

557
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,200
please eat, and don’t
wait for me.

558
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,960
Do you have a battery pack?

559
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,200
Yes ma’am.

560
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,560
The ₹500 one...

561
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,160
There you go.

562
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,000
Can you please guide
me to Aman’s shop?

563
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,280
The third shop on
the opposite lane.

564
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,160
Third one, right?

565
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,960
Yes.

566
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,200
Didi... (Sister)

567
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,520
Excuse me…

568
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,240
Your phone…

569
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,680
Thank you!

570
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,600
Should I take you to Aman’s shop?

571
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:25,840
Sure.

572
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,080
- What’s your name?
- Naeem.

573
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,240
How do you know Aman?

574
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,040
He lives close by.

575
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,320
Oh…

576
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,520
… since you know Aman,

577
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,280
I am sure you know Ishan as well…

578
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,720
He was like an
elder brother to me.

579
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,280
He admonished me for
being a school dropout.

580
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,440
He paid my tuition fees too…

581
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,160
He was kind enough
to lend his laptop too…

582
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,880
But now…

583
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,240
Now what?

584
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,560
Police confiscated his laptop.

585
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,480
Don’t know what
may have happened to him.

586
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,520
I need a favor…

587
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,440
If you hear anything
about Ishan,

588
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,120
will you inform me?

589
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,440
Okay didi...

590
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,160
Please call me on this number.

591
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,120
That’s Aman dada’s shop.

592
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,440
Oh... the shopkeeper
gave me wrong directions.

593
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,800
Aman?

594
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:27,920
Come on in…

595
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,360
How have you been, Naeem?

596
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,320
I am doing good.

597
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,480
Okay didi...

598
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,680
Take care...

599
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,120
So Aman what are the
special branch officers up to?

600
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,440
What else,

601
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,200
They made me wait outside,
for over 3 hours.

602
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,600
- Aman Yadav…
- Yes…

603
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,000
I was asked the same
questions as Namita…

604
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,240
Just, their attitude was
quite different this time.

605
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,040
Some tea, coffee?

606
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,920
Tea?

607
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,200
Listen, get some tea and biscuits…

608
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,920
Speak only the truth…

609
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,040
Don’t mess it up.

610
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,240
Tell me honestly,

611
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,640
was Ishan connected
with this guy?

612
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,520
Sir, I have seen
this guy's picture...

613
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,040
… in Hindi newspapers.

614
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,280
My father reads, so I know...

615
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,840
I don’t remember his name.

616
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,160
Bhishm Rana.

617
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,040
I believe he was linked…

618
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,720
… with some Maoist terror attack.

619
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,480
Sir, believe me,

620
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,560
Ishan cannot be
linked with such a person.

621
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,880
He was…

622
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,160
least concerned about politics,
and such movements.

623
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,080
We had our differences,

624
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,280
agreed, I never liked him…

625
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,240
But, he is not…

626
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,360
… a Maoist for sure.

627
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,840
Okay for now…

628
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,680
… we’ll call you over,
if required.

629
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,080
I’ll take your leave sir.

630
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,600
Have your tea at least…

631
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,400
It's okay sir. Thank you…

632
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,560
I could sense,
they didn’t buy my statement.

633
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,440
I am quite worried.

634
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,040
Yesterday, I spotted someone discreetly
clicking pictures of my shop.

635
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:59,200
I believe, MLA Umashankar,
is quite curious about this case.

636
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,320
When Namita was being
interrogated by the cops.

637
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,960
My father had a word with him…

638
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,640
This didn’t go well
with special branch too...

639
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,840
They accused us of
creating undue pressure.

640
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,840
Truth is, Umashankar
doesn't weild any clout now.

641
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,120
Anyway…

642
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,280
Okay Aman,

643
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,920
you take care.

644
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,680
- Nothing new about it…

645
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,680
It’s a personal issue…

646
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,200
but brand him a terrorist and
end the story.

647
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:35,120
Umashankar ji, don't you think Ankita-Ishan's
relationship being ignored by cops,

648
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,200
is to protect Varman’s image?

649
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,560
I know…

650
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,240
Everyone suspects Varman.

651
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,200
But it’s not easy to
prove his involvement.

652
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,840
- He is sharp…

653
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,640
And look at me…

654
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,040
People elected me…

655
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,480
but I am helpless…

656
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,240
Everything is orchestrated by Varman...

657
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,840
Even you will be unable
to dent his image.

658
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,920
You will be unable
to dent his image.

659
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:12,840
So,

660
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,160
you believe Ishan is
not linked with Bhishm Rana.

661
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,200
Dear, understand one thing...
it's very easy for...

662
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,360
...the educated lot…

663
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,320
...to get trapped into
Bhishm Rana’s ideology.

664
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:31,240
A human being is attracted
by emotions rather than truth.

665
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,440
Bhishm Rana…

666
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:37,720
is not a genuine Maoist activist.

667
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,760
They are all just manipulating
people with their ideologies.

668
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,960
For their own benefit.

669
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,800
- Bhishm Rana…

670
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,120
once floated a militant political party.

671
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,120
He quickly gained
power and popularity.

672
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,320
This made Varman and Shibu
quite uncomfortable,

673
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,400
and they banned his party.

674
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,040
This triggered him off…

675
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,320
resulting…

676
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,160
… the massive explosion
at the MLA hostel.

677
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,840
We all know what happened next.

678
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,440
Reaching Nepal, he first called,
the police commissioner of Kolkata,

679
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,640
… and next, our editor-in-chief.

680
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,920
He took all the responsibility
for the bombing…

681
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,640
… and also…

682
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,000
… threatened to expect
more such bombings.

683
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,000
Still,

684
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,240
it must be ascertained whether...

685
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,480
Bhishm Rana had any
links with Ishan or not.

686
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:40,640
Tell me,

687
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,120
do you have any contacts
in college square? Burtolla?

688
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:49,440
Do you have any contacts?

689
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,600
Nope.

690
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,360
I know someone
who can help you.

691
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:56,440
Who?

692
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,720
Zia.

693
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,600
He owns a tailoring shop.

694
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,320
Tailoring shop.

695
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,440
- Komol, get tea for didi.

696
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,160
Hello, mom…

697
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,960
We are on our way to Kolkata...

698
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,280
your father has a
few meetings lined up.

699
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:27,680
I have planned some shopping.

700
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,040
Mom, why didn’t
you inform me earlier?

701
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,560
I am busy, I can’t spend any time
with you both.

702
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,200
Don’t you ever feel like
spending time with us?

703
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,240
Oh mom, please…

704
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,360
Anyway, let me try.
Okay, bye.

705
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,680
- Can you guide me
to Zia’s tailoring shop?

706
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,640
- Zia?

707
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,040
He will be at the mosque,
in the evening.

708
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:15,000
“Oh Almighty…”

709
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:39,240
“What you seek,
is very much within you.”

710
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:46,840
“Why are you so restless?”

711
00:48:48,280 --> 00:49:02,840
“What are you looking for,
oh wanderer?”

712
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,280
It’s okay, take it.

713
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,520
Thank you…

714
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,560
I have had several interactions with…

715
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,280
… the cops and journalists…

716
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,240
This is the first time I am
seeing a lady crime reporter.

717
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,960
You are quite gutsy…

718
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,120
I am sorry to say,
I can’t accept your offer.

719
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,240
I have quit this job long back.

720
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,440
Now it’s just…

721
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:39,760
spiritual practice and Sufi recitals.

722
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,960
This is my life.

723
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,280
I visited Ajmer last year.

724
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,720
Ajmer Sharif…

725
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,600
Had food from the community kitchen,
heard the hymn 'Dua-e-Roshni'.

726
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,880
I have heard this qawwali
(Islamic devotional singing) too.

727
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,320
That’s great…

728
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,000
Ajmer Sharif, 'Dua-e-Roshni'.

729
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,560
I went alone.

730
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,000
I’ll take your leave…

731
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,560
… will see you some other time.

732
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,000
Take care…

733
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,840
Taxi…

734
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,000
'He was very passionate
about street plays. '

735
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,840
'He was against violence
and this so-called red revolution.'

736
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,120
'But brand him a terrorist
end the story.'

737
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,960
'And you think it’s not important
to interrogate Ankita Chauhan?'

738
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,120
'We have been advised
not to disturb her.'

739
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:47,960
Hello…

740
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,000
Our relationship ended
much before he went missing.

741
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,240
We both were...

742
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,760
quite incompatible.

743
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,560
Of course, we met a few times,

744
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:04,960
but isn’t it common to stay
friends even after you breakup?

745
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,840
I heard from your close friends,

746
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,000
you both were in
quite serious relationship.

747
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,560
I am from a very small village,
with very conservative upbringing.

748
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,840
How serious do you think,

749
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,880
I would’ve been about
an unemployed guy?

750
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,560
I have some screenshots
of your social media account.

751
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,640
Quite elaborate posts
against classism, casteism...

752
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,840
You seem to be quite broadminded,

753
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,000
very liberal thoughts.

754
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:40,800
Nice.

755
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,920
I guess you deleted your account
to conceal these facts, right?

756
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,960
According to your call records.

757
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,080
Ishan was last seen here,
in your house.

758
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,600
Yes...

759
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,280
Yes he did come here...

760
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,520
just the way you landed up here.

761
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,040
From here, if you
go missing today,

762
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,960
am I to be held responsible
for your disappearance?

763
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,000
Read this,

764
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,640
Bhishm Rana’s interview...

765
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,600
It’s a 6-year-old interview
for 'The Weekly Tribune' magazine.

766
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,920
He addressed the youth,

767
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:42,240
asking them to support the less
fortunate countrymen...

768
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,920
... instead of being glued to IPL.

769
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,200
Quite patriotic, I must say...

770
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,040
Patriotic? Or idiotic?

771
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,040
I can’t decide...

772
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,040
I thought this will be
helpful for you...

773
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,000
... and what’s his name?

774
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:54,960
Ishan...

775
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,360
Ishan was inducted
by this guy, right?

776
00:53:59,160 --> 00:53:59,840
Suspected...

777
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,320
I thought that...

778
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,600
What made you think, I would've
missed reading this article, joy?

779
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,000
But I really appreciate it.
Thank you...

780
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,960
May I get back to work?

781
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,080
Hey, hope this bitter gourd
juice will not kill me.

782
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,600
Hey, just make some
carrot juice for him.

783
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,720
He can never handle bottle
or bitter gourd juice.

784
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,760
Namaste, sir...

785
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,000
Peace to you. Sir.

786
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,760
Namaste...
May peace be upon you.

787
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,720
Do you guys know me?

788
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,920
Oh sir, you are an
illustrious personality.

789
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:52,960
Okay...

790
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,240
Sir, can you teach us to focus?

791
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,920
Focus on...?

792
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:00,760
Yes.

793
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,600
Perhaps teach your granddaughter
to take her focus off certain things?

794
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,320
Her job is so dangerous.

795
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,400
Sir, it will be good,
if she quits, what do you say?

796
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,520
I am sure many powerful people
turn foe in this profession.

797
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:22,000
Many influential people
befriend you as well.

798
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,920
Sir, crime reporters
write about mafia,

799
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,800
politicians...

800
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,880
and often there is a
nexus between them.

801
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,880
I am sure her life is
endangered all the time.

802
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,840
Not just her, danger
looms over her family too.

803
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,680
What if, her family is harmed,
because of her doings.

804
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,640
It could be our dear professor.

805
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,160
Ah, only a stupid person
can think of doing that.

806
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,040
I mean...

807
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:55,000
Someone, who has lived
his life to the fullest,

808
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,480
and is also enjoying these
extra years of happiness...

809
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,200
... it’s so stupid to
threaten such a person,

810
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,120
what are your views?

811
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:05,720
You are right sir.

812
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,120
They should just kidnap you,

813
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,840
That’s enough to trouble her.

814
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:10,880
Wow!

815
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,400
That’ll be fun.

816
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,080
Quite thrilling at this age.

817
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,400
Super adventurous.

818
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,280
What if, your
kidnapping is successful...

819
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,120
and while at it,
you accidentally get stabbed, and die...

820
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,400
I have good understanding
of Bhagawad Gita.

821
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,560
I won’t die so easily...

822
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,120
also, I am not someone
who is scared of death.

823
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,720
So get these lame
ideas out of your head.

824
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,720
Get going dear...

825
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,920
have some juice...

826
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,640
carrot juice...

827
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,440
is good for your health.

828
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,760
I know the truth.

829
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,000
Rana is hiding.

830
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,400
I want to talk to him in person.

831
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,480
Not possible.

832
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,400
He connects with
people as he pleases.

833
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,400
Sir, this is important.

834
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,960
I need to talk to him.

835
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,200
Let's not speak further.
I need to go now.

836
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,120
You take care.
Good bye.

837
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,520
If the theory of Ishan’s Maoist
link gets refuted...

838
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:41,800
Then,

839
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,680
Varman is my prime suspect.

840
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,520
Special branch is going
to stonewall you.

841
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,480
We’ll see.

842
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,360
I have something to tell you.

843
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,360
Just listen to it,
and don’t react to it.

844
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,040
The infrastructure
MNC that I work with,

845
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,600
they have their own network...

846
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,560
Okay...

847
00:57:59,000 --> 00:57:59,680
And...

848
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:02,960
a colleague from my
Kolkata office was telling me...

849
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:04,360
About this contract...

850
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:08,720
a construction company in Durgapur,
deals a lot with Varman...

851
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,400
I mean whenever a government
contract is executed,

852
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,280
Varman gets a cut.

853
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,360
I get that system...
come to the point.

854
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:19,200
This construction company in Durgapur
is owned by Mr. Sanjeev Sahani.

855
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:47,960
Sanjeev...

856
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,480
This is for Vidhi...

857
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,560
She spends all her hard earned
money on cabs and taxis...

858
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,360
She should drive her own car.

859
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,840
Her mom wanted me to
wait till her birthday.

860
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:04,600
I said,

861
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,480
I will buy her something
else for birthday.

862
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,440
It's an automatic car.

863
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,240
Stop...

864
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,320
There's a man,

865
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,720
Ruhel Dabraki

866
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:28,160
Rana calls him for all his needs.

867
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,600
He is a Nepal resident,

868
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,440
but presently he is in town.

869
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,440
Is he quite close to Rana?

870
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,560
He is his arms
and ammunition supplier.

871
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,520
I know his whereabouts.

872
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,840
Meet me there in 2 hours.

873
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,400
Okay?

874
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,800
Let’s go...

875
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,440
Such a bright girl,

876
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:01,440
why is she wasting her life
amidst these crooks and cops.

877
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,680
Also, it’s a male dominant field.

878
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,800
She doesn’t care
about our views.

879
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,680
I think only Jeet can
talk some sense to her.

880
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:11,160
I hope Jeet doesn’t get
dumped in the bargain.

881
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,880
It’s the twenty first century,
professions aren’t gender based.

882
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,320
If you are good, you are good.

883
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:36,040
Vidhi is damn good at her job.

884
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,360
She is working
on an important story...

885
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,360
about an influential minister.

886
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:44,840
Who?

887
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,840
Varman!

888
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,760
Sorry,

889
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,440
Rana is a media shy person.

890
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,640
I must talk to him.

891
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,640
It’s about a young innocent lad,
whose life is in danger.

892
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,200
Please.

893
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,320
She is playing with fire.

894
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,240
No point waiting for her.

895
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,160
I’ll be in my Kolkata office
next week, the entire week.

896
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,680
Please ask her to come
see me, at the earliest.

897
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,280
- It's getting difficult sir,

898
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,840
by acting without proper evidences.

899
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,760
MLA Umashankar Mukherjee
is adding to our woes...

900
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:48,320
by protesting, talking to press,

901
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,480
soon he'll take out rallies.

902
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,160
Has Vidhi met Uma Shankar?

903
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,640
And she is showing a lot
of interest in this case.

904
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:58,400
Okay...

905
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,720
She is ruffling quite
a few feathers...

906
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,360
Can’t we fix her?

907
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:08,400
Sir, her father has business
ties with our government.

908
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,800
I am sure you'll find a link.

909
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,000
Sanjeev Sahani.

910
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,320
Sanjeev Sahani...

911
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:19,960
How about some beer?

912
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,440
No sir, thank you...

913
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,280
Hey come on... it’s Sunday...

914
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,040
The tea is fine...

915
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,040
Probir, I feel we should
fearlessly do our jobs.

916
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,440
We are righteous people.

917
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,440
Truth alone triumphs.

918
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,320
Are you really sure sir?

919
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,960
Truth... alone triumphs?

920
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,960
- You know, for me...

921
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,480
- there is a clear line...

922
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,000
- between my work life,

923
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,440
and my personal life...

924
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,480
but I don’t think that
line exists for you...

925
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,240
Ya, work is life for me.

926
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,760
We’ve had this
discussion earlier too.

927
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,800
I don’t know why you
keep coming back to it.

928
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,480
And I am not sorry for it.

929
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,920
You act as if this is some
very big scoop.

930
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,160
It’s just a local story...

931
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,840
it's not even national news.

932
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,240
It may not be a national news,

933
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,520
but is an apt case for
national human rights commission?

934
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,520
Do you have any idea,

935
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,840
what Ishan’s family
is going through?

936
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,000
Vidhi,

937
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,720
I think you are getting
too obsessed with this case.

938
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,120
It’s so predictable,

939
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,240
for a Dalit boy to turn a Maoist...

940
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,320
It’s not earth shattering,
it happens all the time.

941
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,760
An ordinary person
has gone missing.

942
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,480
That’s it...

943
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,400
What did you just say?

944
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:52,160
Just come...
sit here.

945
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:55,240
Every 8 minutes,
a child goes missing in India.

946
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,200
Everyday, 174 children go missing.

947
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,440
35-40 adults go missing
alone in the city of Mumbai.

948
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:05,000
500-600 adults go missing in Kolkata...

949
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,360
EVERY MONTH!

950
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,200
If you are missing
out your loved ones?

951
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,560
Reach out to me...

952
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,560
#LOST

953
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,720
What do you mean by Dalits?

954
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,480
Aren’t they humans
like you and me?

955
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,200
You are just…

956
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,760
I think you should
just leave Jeet...

957
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,560
Just leave.

958
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,320
Nanu...

959
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,960
Looks like you are too busy...

960
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:13,000
You have to draw a line between,
your personal and professional life...

961
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,760
I am concerned
about your health.

962
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,320
Jeet is right,

963
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:25,360
You must learn to switch off
your professional mode,

964
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:29,120
for yourself, for him.

965
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,440
Did you hear what he said...

966
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:35,560
How...

967
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:38,000
casually he just said it.

968
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,000
I don’t know this Jeet.

969
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,160
Clearly, even he
doesn’t know me.

970
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,560
Don’t be judgmental.

971
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,360
Empower yourself to such
great heights that,

972
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,480
before He writes your fate...

973
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,360
The Almighty will have to ask,

974
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,800
what is it you desire?

975
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,760
This is the basic
design of the bridge.

976
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,120
As far as the technical
committee is concerned.

977
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,000
They are very confident
on the commencement date.

978
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:26,680
If there are any delays due
to contingencies or otherwise,

979
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:29,240
We should act swiftly
and in haste.

980
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:40,520
Look,

981
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,640
I never interfered
in your matters.

982
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,120
But, now...

983
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,840
... you have no idea
what you are getting into.

984
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,280
Why?

985
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,920
so that your
business can thrive?

986
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:00,560
If you've never interfered,
in my matters, in the past.

987
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,720
Don't think you
should do it now either.

988
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:18,880
Vidhi...

989
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,040
This is for you...

990
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:21,720
Thank you.

991
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,400
Ms. Righteous.

992
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,280
How long will it take to
shatter your windshield?

993
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:44,480
10 seconds,

994
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,040
30 seconds...

995
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,520
Which is the most
dangerous acid?

996
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,960
Hope you enjoyed the quiz.

997
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:26,960
Hey... what’s wrong
with you?

998
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:29,600
Nothing.

999
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:41,000
Hello...

1000
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,280
Namita here...

1001
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,560
This is my friend’s cellphone.

1002
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,840
I bumped into Ishan’s friend...

1003
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:49,080
She said, Ishan and Ankita,

1004
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:53,800
had actually, filed their
marriage application.

1005
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:57,720
The registrar’s office is located
between Beadon Street and C R Avenue.

1006
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:01,480
Sir,

1007
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,120
I need some information...

1008
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:08,280
Did Ishan Bharti and Ankita Chauhan,

1009
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:10,920
file their marriage application,
under special marriage act?

1010
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,640
Who are you?

1011
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,560
I am Vidhi Sahani,
Daybreak.in

1012
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,440
We are not authorized
to give out such information.

1013
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,120
Sir, this boy has gone missing,

1014
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,920
his family is going through hell.

1015
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,640
Please help sir.

1016
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:26,760
Please.

1017
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,920
This is so annoying.

1018
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:33,400
This one sir...

1019
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,360
Can I click a picture please?

1020
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,440
I swear, your identity will
be kept confidential.

1021
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,480
Thank you, sir...
thank you so much.

1022
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:52,840
How can you be so rude
to your father?

1023
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,360
Why did you return the keys?

1024
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,040
How dare you throw
the keys at him!

1025
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:59,840
He is so hurt,
do you even know that?

1026
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:03,280
What about me?

1027
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:05,880
Did you bother
to check how I felt?

1028
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,080
If papa thinks,

1029
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,880
he can influence my decisions,

1030
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:11,720
then he is wrong.

1031
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:13,480
You now...

1032
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,240
...he won't even
speak a word to you.

1033
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,000
Okay,

1034
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,560
that’s good, it’s settled then,
neither am I very keen.

1035
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,600
Do convey my feelings to him...

1036
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:21,560
Vidhi!

1037
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,720
Did you behave so rude?

1038
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:31,600
Did you throw
the keys at him?

1039
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,400
Of course kids do misbehave,

1040
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,000
but a matured person,

1041
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,080
would sit across the table
and sort out their differences.

1042
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,440
Anuradha, this also is true...

1043
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,760
when kids grow up,

1044
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,240
one should learn to
respect their decisions.

1045
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:54,880
Okay... Nanu,

1046
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:56,720
just to clarify...

1047
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,720
I merely returned
the keys to him.

1048
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,520
I did not misbehave,
the way she is portraying it.

1049
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,960
You know me well enough.

1050
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:11,200
Dad,

1051
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,480
one should be practical in life.

1052
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:17,720
Yes, being practical also implies
being corrupt in these circumstances.

1053
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,920
Anyone who stays with you...

1054
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:23,920
... deserves to be awarded,
‘The Padmashree' for righteousness.

1055
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,160
There she goes,

1056
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,840
as a kid she always
loved the fritters I made...

1057
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,800
God bless you...

1058
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:43,560
Vote for...

1059
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,040
Ankita Chauhan...

1060
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:50,440
- Vote for...
- Ankita Chauhan...

1061
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,160
Nanu, tea...

1062
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,640
[Wanna meet?... At my place?]

1063
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,120
No, no I have to go.

1064
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,680
Your marriage application
form is in my possession.

1065
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,480
Why did you lie?

1066
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:47,400
His family is being tortured.

1067
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:52,400
Namaste!

1068
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,440
Ankita Chauhan?

1069
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,720
Please come in...

1070
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,080
Has he really joined
any terrorist outfits?

1071
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,280
... or is he dead?

1072
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,480
I am sure you have
a clear idea about it.

1073
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:25,800
“There isn’t any serene
rainy day anymore...”

1074
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:30,600
“nor any hope
of some happiness...”

1075
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:40,080
“My desire to sleep to
a sweet lullaby is all lost.”

1076
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,320
“Tell me who is...
responsible for this?”

1077
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:45,320
- Ishan and I were
madly in love...

1078
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:50,520
... but circumstances separated us.

1079
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,240
Is he alive?

1080
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,880
This question bothers me a lot.

1081
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,080
But I swear...

1082
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:05,080
I don’t know.

1083
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:15,120
Why didn’t you go to the cops,
after Ishan went missing?

1084
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,680
I am scared of the cops...

1085
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:32,960
Oh really? Don’t you have
Varman by your side?

1086
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:39,000
Or, is he the whole
reason behind this all?

1087
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:43,920
I don’t know...

1088
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,560
Please keep this off record.

1089
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,480
You have my word.
Off record.

1090
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:04,240
Being a woman, you’ll
understand my situation.

1091
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:08,640
I moved away from Ishan,
for his own good.

1092
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,040
Oh, not for your own benefit?

1093
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,120
Who would say no to the perks?

1094
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,440
But I never had any
ill feelings for him.

1095
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:27,800
If you talk about, or expose
my marriage application form...

1096
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:33,160
...then I will have no choice,
except commit suicide.

1097
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:45,880
- The story is real...

1098
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:52,440
...but what if it costs
someone their life...?

1099
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:53,880
Then...?

1100
01:15:58,840 --> 01:15:59,680
What’s...

1101
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:03,240
important for a reporter?

1102
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,880
To report the truth...

1103
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,160
or to do what’s right...

1104
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,200
Many years ago,

1105
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,560
when I was teaching
in a college.

1106
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:27,880
During my college elections,

1107
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,280
one of my students... very young,

1108
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,680
quite powerful and influential.

1109
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:42,520
The government back then,
wanted to control every union.

1110
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,160
They lacked majority in my college.

1111
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:49,440
I expected some disturbances...

1112
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,440
And I was not wrong.

1113
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,560
My office was vandalized.

1114
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:03,160
Cops came over to enquire...

1115
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,800
I filed my report.

1116
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:11,960
The presiding cop,
made a weird request.

1117
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,400
He asked me to strike off the name
of the said influential politician.

1118
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:20,840
He said, if I refuse to obey,
there will be a few innocent students,

1119
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,200
who will be falsely implicated.

1120
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:23,720
and if I oblige,

1121
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:27,720
they will not cause any
harm to other innocent students...

1122
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,760
they will be bailed,

1123
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,440
their cases will be diluted.

1124
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,240
So what do you think,
I did back then?

1125
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:45,840
I struck off his name...

1126
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,120
I never judged my action.

1127
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:56,440
Today, you are faced
with a similar situation.

1128
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:21,640
What nonsense is this?

1129
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,040
This is an annual function
at his ancestral village.

1130
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,760
He goes every year.

1131
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,120
He is quite influential
in those parts.

1132
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:32,000
People vote for his candidate.

1133
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,600
You met Ankita, right?

1134
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,080
Any new leads?

1135
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:40,920
No!

1136
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,920
The rumour at the
Press Club is that,

1137
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,000
Varman has secretly
tied the knot with Ankita.

1138
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:51,480
During Ankita’s campaign,

1139
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:55,880
Party workers talk about
supporting their sister-in-law.

1140
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,360
Your story is already very late.

1141
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,240
Can you publish it before
the municipal elections?

1142
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,760
I am almost ready.

1143
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:06,720
Okay great...

1144
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,480
What update do
you have on Zia?

1145
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:12,880
It’s very difficult to
crack the Naxal angle.

1146
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:46,680
Hello!

1147
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:47,760
- Vidhi ma’am...

1148
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:49,520
- Cops have picked up Naeem.

1149
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:50,520
Naeem?

1150
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,120
Yes...

1151
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,760
Why?

1152
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,240
Can I talk to you?

1153
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,160
Yes...

1154
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,440
Did you arrest a minor kid?

1155
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:05,960
Naeem?

1156
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,440
Yes or no?

1157
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,080
Ma’am it’s a routine procedure...

1158
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:11,880
So, that means "yes"...

1159
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:13,880
Please sit...

1160
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,480
Where is he?

1161
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:17,360
Where is he?

1162
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,800
Please cool down...

1163
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:21,440
He is inside, chatting
with our senior inspector.

1164
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:22,800
Oh, chatting is it?

1165
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:23,880
since last night?

1166
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,320
It's 12 noon now...

1167
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,520
Did you inform his guardian?

1168
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,000
Did you serve him 49A?

1169
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:31,160
I want to see the copy of 49A.

1170
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,120
Ma’am please cool down,
it's nothing serious.

1171
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,880
So there is no question
of serving 49A.

1172
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:37,800
Okay then...

1173
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,520
I have recorded
your statement.

1174
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:41,480
Where is he?

1175
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:42,560
Ma’am...

1176
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,280
What mess is she up to?

1177
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:46,000
Ma’am... please wait...

1178
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,600
Listen to me please...

1179
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,480
- I swear you will rot in prison,
all your life.

1180
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:51,720
Don’t you know...

1181
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,000
... he is a minor?

1182
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:54,640
What is this, Sen?

1183
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,400
Ma’am... please...

1184
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:06,040
You’ve arrested a minor,
without serving 49A.

1185
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:08,920
You have been
unlawfully torturing him.

1186
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:11,320
This news will be reported
along with your pictures.

1187
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:12,880
Your officers may let this pass,

1188
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,360
but the honorable court
will have you suspended.

1189
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:18,200
Madam please come out, please.

1190
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,320
Madam please calm down.
Can I get you some tea?

1191
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:36,320
Instead of this
blackmail drama,

1192
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,040
you could’ve done
a sensible story.

1193
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:41,480
You've abandoned journalism,
and got into activism now?

1194
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:45,320
What was the need for all this, and that too,
to protect a suspect?

1195
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,840
I had an earful
from their officer.

1196
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:50,720
Who called you?

1197
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,600
The joint commissioner from
the special branch, right?

1198
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:58,480
Okay,

1199
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,280
let me handover this case
to the human rights commission,

1200
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:03,520
and quit...

1201
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,320
Come on!

1202
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:05,360
Don’t get so emotional.

1203
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,920
Please sit down.

1204
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,800
Is it a crime,
to call a spade a spade?

1205
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:11,760
Vidhi...

1206
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:14,640
...there is something
called ‘Practicality’.

1207
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:15,720
Practicality?

1208
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:19,080
I have heard enough of it...

1209
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,240
Have you heard of, ‘Conscience’?

1210
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:26,720
Listen...

1211
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,160
Black coffee?

1212
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,600
Cool down.

1213
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:08,560
Hello...

1214
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,000
Take him.

1215
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:05,840
My party strongly
believes in...

1216
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:07,320
- Truth,

1217
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:08,440
- Deed,

1218
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:09,560
- and determination.

1219
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,040
Look, with all due respect,

1220
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,800
- the oppositions methods,
they are archaic.

1221
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:20,520
- For us to move into the
twenty first century,

1222
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,440
what we need to
create, is jobs.

1223
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:23,440
We need to evolve,

1224
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:24,480
We need to progress.

1225
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,400
So, we have to
empower the youth.

1226
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:29,160
Which is the only way we
can then, empower ourselves,

1227
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,480
that we need some change.

1228
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:36,520
Okay... I will talk to you later.

1229
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:41,640
Do you remember,
I got you, your first case?

1230
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,080
Yes of course...

1231
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:47,080
I am interested in this,
present case of yours.

1232
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:48,920
Why are you...

1233
01:25:49,200 --> 01:25:51,640
going around enquiring
people about Ishan?

1234
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,480
Let my story get published...

1235
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,200
then we can discuss it.

1236
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:02,200
Your act, can jeopardize
special branch’s investigation.

1237
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,280
Should I just end the story here,

1238
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,720
and publish it along
with your quote?

1239
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:14,600
University college professors
have ruined it all...

1240
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:18,120
in the free time, they go around
in the guise of human right activists...

1241
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:22,680
...and you 24 hours
professional reporters,

1242
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:25,600
are ever ready to soft
target police officers.

1243
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:29,680
And these two
adversaries of yours,

1244
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,960
are always proved wrong.

1245
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,560
Right, Mr. Ghoshal?

1246
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,960
You know very well
what happens at every level...

1247
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:38,400
but,

1248
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,640
you conveniently
turn a blind eye to it.

1249
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:46,160
The entire department
cannot be implicated,

1250
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,920
because of just one
partially corrupt officer.

1251
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:49,960
Sorry...

1252
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,160
with your permission,

1253
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,600
I’d like to correct
your sentence sir.

1254
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:58,240
Just one partially honest officer...

1255
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,480
cannot brand the
entire department clean.

1256
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,560
It’s impossible
to argue with you.

1257
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:05,760
Let's come to the point.

1258
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:07,880
Vidhi,

1259
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:14,040
we are pressurized to investigate
with suspicion as the main angle.

1260
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:15,360
By whom?

1261
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,080
- More coffee?
- Name?

1262
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:23,840
You are well versed with the
tactics of Bhishm Rana.

1263
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:26,800
Powerful men like Uma Shankar
Mukhopadhyay,

1264
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,520
are scared of him.

1265
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,960
It’s too soon to conclude,

1266
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:37,880
that Police is relying on stereotypes alone.

1267
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:39,400
Please...

1268
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,600
Looks like we’ll need
some more coffee.

1269
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,040
Hello, Nanu...

1270
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,120
Yes...

1271
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:02,840
What?

1272
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:08,200
I am staying home tonight.

1273
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,920
I need some time to think.

1274
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:15,720
There are quite
a lot of confusions.

1275
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,800
Why is our life
so complicated?

1276
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:23,960
I badly need the
tea you make.

1277
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,640
Are you heading out?

1278
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,160
Yes...

1279
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:12,680
What’s the matter?

1280
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,760
I mean, the nature of your job,

1281
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:21,600
are you entitled to any security,
protection in this job?

1282
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,800
Come on Nanu,
I am a journalist.

1283
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,440
We don’t get any security...

1284
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:28,280
And for what?

1285
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:35,680
Hope you have not
received any threats.

1286
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,640
Why are you asking this
all of a sudden?

1287
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:41,840
Nothing... just...

1288
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:48,640
Nanu...

1289
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,320
... what happened?

1290
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,560
Nothing, I am perfectly fine.

1291
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:09,960
I want you to be very careful.

1292
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:24,640
Wait!

1293
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,360
Follow me.

1294
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,160
Varman sir is ready
to meet you, sir.

1295
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:41,880
Please come...

1296
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:45,920
- So, what we need to do,

1297
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,320
- is recognize the ones that have made

1298
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,240
- significant contribution
in the constituency,

1299
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,600
- and then highlight...

1300
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:54,280
Please come...

1301
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:55,880
Please sit sir...

1302
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:04,520
Like good old days, would you like
to insult me in public, or...?

1303
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:07,160
should we talk in private?

1304
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:12,120
You know, I don’t beat
around the bush.

1305
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,160
Order sir...

1306
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,640
I am not here to order you...

1307
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:19,880
It’s a warning.

1308
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:26,000
You very well know
the reason for this warning.

1309
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:28,880
Varman...

1310
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:34,600
I have never caused any
harm to anyone all my life.

1311
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:38,040
I know you are
used to violence.

1312
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:41,040
and sabotage people’s work.

1313
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,880
Let me be very clear...

1314
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:53,120
If I find you causing
any trouble to her.

1315
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:58,760
I swear... I will strangle
you to death in public.

1316
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:04,240
I am sure you still remember
the strength of my hands.

1317
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:06,480
Right?

1318
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:15,440
Kunal Da,

1319
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,160
someone has sent this is for Vidhi…

1320
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,360
the sender said,
it’s extremely urgent.

1321
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:20,520
Thank you,

1322
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:24,480
'The mobile subscriber you have called,
is currently not reachable.'

1323
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,440
Quiz…

1324
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:42,160
Which flower is
showered at a funeral?

1325
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:44,400
Lilly. Rose. Marigold.

1326
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:49,400
It’s become difficult to
meet someone at home.

1327
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,560
All our activities are monitored.

1328
01:32:57,560 --> 01:32:59,200
Aman has decided to…

1329
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,200
relocate to Nepal.

1330
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:04,520
He intends to take up a job,
or start something on his own.

1331
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,920
We’ve been fighting
a lot over this issue.

1332
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:13,880
I don’t want to abandon
my home and relocate.

1333
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:15,240
This is my home,

1334
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:17,600
I want to live and die here.

1335
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:24,080
And Ishan is being
blamed for our situation.

1336
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:32,680
My marriage is on
the verge of breaking.

1337
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,360
I have made up my mind…

1338
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:41,520
I will not tolerate
any false allegations.

1339
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:49,400
Have it.

1340
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:52,440
It’s their special

1341
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:54,880
You’ll love it.

1342
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,080
It’s very tasty…

1343
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,440
My mom will stay with me.

1344
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:11,600
It's decided.

1345
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:25,920
It’s nice.

1346
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:37,080
What is this?

1347
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:40,120
I need to know, everything that
you have been hiding from me.

1348
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:42,960
I never took this
seriously at all!

1349
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,760
Come see my inbox...

1350
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:49,760
There are several such rape,
attack threats…

1351
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:53,720
Here at least the sender has put in
some effort to create this.

1352
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:57,080
I want to know your
opinion about me first.

1353
01:34:57,240 --> 01:35:00,920
I am answerable to
the editor-in-chief, not you…

1354
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:03,960
For your information, the editor-in-chief
had greenlit this story.

1355
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:05,760
So the legal fallout,

1356
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:07,200
political stance,

1357
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:08,960
and drop in advertising
revenue due to this story,

1358
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,520
should it all be ignored?

1359
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:12,200
No pain, no gain.

1360
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:16,120
News portals reap huge
benefits due to such stories.

1361
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:17,040
Vidhi…

1362
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,320
promise me one thing…

1363
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:23,520
You have to inform me
if you receive any kind of threat.

1364
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:31,440
- Namaste…
- Namaste!

1365
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:32,800
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

1366
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:33,360
Good…

1367
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:36,360
'Long live, Ankita Chauhan!'

1368
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:40,640
'Long live, Ankita Chauhan!'

1369
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:44,640
How well do you
know Ankita Chauhan?

1370
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,960
As much as I am
supposed to know her.

1371
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:48,760
Do you know,

1372
01:35:49,240 --> 01:35:51,800
she was in a relationship
with Ishan Bharti?

1373
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:52,720
Was…

1374
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,320
That’s the past tense…right?

1375
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:56,480
The past shouldn’t get anyone tense.

1376
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:00,920
There is a rumour that
you got him kidnapped.

1377
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:02,560
Being a journalist,

1378
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:05,800
you should talk with proofs,
and not on mere suspicion.

1379
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:09,120
Is it true, the house
Ankita is living in,

1380
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,600
belongs to an NGO, registered
on your mother’s name?

1381
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,760
is that true?

1382
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,600
Ishan went missing from there.

1383
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:18,360
Two unrelated facts.

1384
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:19,800
What’s your question?

1385
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:24,320
Witnesses are being threatened…

1386
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:25,920
Now, is that also a rumour?

1387
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,640
Ishan’s close friend
Kushal is dead too…

1388
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,960
His body was found
at the tram depot.

1389
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,280
Are you accusing me
of murder, Ms. Sahani?

1390
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:34,760
No, no…

1391
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:36,520
I don’t have an accusation…

1392
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:37,280
yet.

1393
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:39,560
Just a few more questions…

1394
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:42,960
Did you inform the police
and special branch,

1395
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,920
about Ishan’s links with terrorist?

1396
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,840
I am not a police
informer by profession.

1397
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:51,640
It’s believed that you are doing
this for your personal gain.

1398
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:53,240
It’s all politics…

1399
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:55,040
they are out to malign me.

1400
01:36:57,640 --> 01:36:58,480
You are right…

1401
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:02,040
According to my sources, Mr. Varman…

1402
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:04,520
Young activists are being tortured,

1403
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:06,040
interrogated…

1404
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:07,320
without any reason…

1405
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:08,200
Is that true?

1406
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:11,480
Special branch is
under the Home Minister.

1407
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:13,880
Well that takes me
to my next question.

1408
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:18,560
Are you guilty of interfering
in the affairs of other ministries?

1409
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:20,640
owing to your closeness to the CM?

1410
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:22,960
I should be flattered,

1411
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
that you think
I am this powerful

1412
01:37:25,480 --> 01:37:27,160
I am just a humble
soldier of the party,

1413
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:29,880
and a damn good minister,
if I may say so myself.

1414
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:30,720
That’s it.

1415
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:34,760
Have you married Ankita Chauhan?

1416
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,040
That is a personal question.

1417
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:42,720
Am I expected to answer?

1418
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:43,720
No!

1419
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:45,200
And I shall not.

1420
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:50,120
A woman can be successful,
without needing the help of a man.

1421
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:53,520
At least a progressive woman
like you should appreciate this fact.

1422
01:38:01,240 --> 01:38:02,000
That’ll be all…

1423
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:02,760
Thank you…

1424
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,440
Thank you!

1425
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,400
Your father is here…

1426
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,920
He drove all the
way from Durgapur,

1427
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,440
He is waiting to see you.

1428
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:43,080
Yes…

1429
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:48,080
...I have received threats stating
new projects will get stalled.

1430
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,640
I am not giving you a guilt trip.

1431
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:53,800
You are a journalist,

1432
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,480
you should know the facts.

1433
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:58,200
I know that…

1434
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:02,520
I told your mom
about the threats,

1435
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:04,640
do you know what she said?

1436
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:09,400
What if they really
shut our businesses…

1437
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,040
how will we survive?

1438
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:19,320
I said, I have enough
investments to feed our family…

1439
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,800
We may not eat exotic food…

1440
01:40:22,680 --> 01:40:24,840
but we can surely wash it down
with some Indian red wine,

1441
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:27,000
which is not bad now-a-days.

1442
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,960
But finally our daughter...

1443
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:38,600
... may accompany us at the table.

1444
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,960
Can I leave the keys with you now?

1445
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,280
Heading is good.

1446
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,040
I will need to get it cleared
by our Editor-in-chief.

1447
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:05,800
But…

1448
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:08,000
this story is going
to be a huge hit.

1449
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:11,840
Can I call it a day then?

1450
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:14,240
Of course, you deserve an off.

1451
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:16,440
Go home, and relax.

1452
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:18,560
Thank you.

1453
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:40,520
Vidhi, I wasn’t here just
on an official visit,

1454
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:44,160
I thought we could
rekindle our relationship.

1455
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,840
But I realize, for you…

1456
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,520
… your work comes first.

1457
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:01,920
It’s who you are…

1458
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:05,200
and,

1459
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:08,040
I need to understand that.

1460
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:12,040
I think, in the process
of trying to fix this relation,

1461
01:42:13,240 --> 01:42:16,240
we have become
a liability to each other.

1462
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:18,480
If you ever need me,

1463
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,080
I will be there for you.

1464
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:28,600
I took a day off, today…

1465
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:35,680
How about another
round of tea?

1466
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,000
“This lovely city,
is like a beautiful sea.”

1467
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:58,520
“Where our hearts sailed like two
inseparable boats in this sea.”

1468
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:05,880
“It all looked so beautiful
when we were in love,”

1469
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:10,360
“...just when a storm
wrecked it all for us.”

1470
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:12,320
“I have lost my love,”

1471
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:13,440
“my dreams…”

1472
01:43:13,560 --> 01:43:14,920
“...as my boat sank in this ocean…”

1473
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:19,600
“ending this beautiful relation,
forcing us to walk away as strangers.”

1474
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:21,520
“It’s like losing the moon,

1475
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:24,240
“the beautiful moonlight …”

1476
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,160
“...plunging the sky into darkness…”

1477
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:30,080
“…ending this beautiful relation,
forcing us to walk away as strangers.”

1478
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:32,160
Your summons have come.

1479
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:42,680
“This vast city is
like a beautiful sea.”

1480
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:47,920
“Where our hearts sailed together,
without any worries…”

1481
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:51,120
Hello, Kunal da…

1482
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,080
Please hold the story.

1483
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:55,800
There is some new development.

1484
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:58,360
I might have to add something.

1485
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:01,280
Okay, thank you.

1486
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:19,360
Ruhel Dabraki…?

1487
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:21,320
On the first floor,
room number, 118.

1488
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,040
I kept my word…

1489
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:25,480
He’ll be on call soon.

1490
01:44:25,720 --> 01:44:26,360
Come sit.

1491
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:47,320
Namaste!

1492
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:48,920
Namaste!

1493
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:50,840
I did a background check on you.

1494
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:54,960
I believe you are not someone
who chases news just for sensation.

1495
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:57,360
You believe in thorough research.

1496
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:00,000
You believe in thorough research.

1497
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,360
Were you linked to Ishan Bharti?

1498
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,880
as the case was being transferred
to the police and special branch?

1499
01:45:08,200 --> 01:45:09,040
None, whatsoever.

1500
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:11,040
Did you know him personally?

1501
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:13,000
I saw him during one of his
street plays.

1502
01:45:14,680 --> 01:45:16,720
Where the skirmish broke out.

1503
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:19,600
For how long will we be
treated as untouchables?

1504
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:22,440
For how long should we be
deprived of our basic rights?

1505
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,480
No. Not anymore.

1506
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:26,560
We can save ourselves
by using our only weapon…

1507
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:27,840
And that is…

1508
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:30,000
Education...!

1509
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:32,080
Stop this nonsense…

1510
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:34,080
Do not try to instigate
innocent people.

1511
01:45:34,240 --> 01:45:35,240
My name is Ishan Bharti.

1512
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:36,680
I am a Dalit (Backward Class),
I am fighting for their rights.

1513
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:39,040
Education...!

1514
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:40,600
I liked his ideologies.

1515
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:45,480
His play was quite
thought provoking.

1516
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:48,960
It showed how our so-called
mainstream political parties...

1517
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:51,160
... manipulate lower caste
population for their benefit.

1518
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,160
Is he alive?

1519
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:54,560
Yes, very much…

1520
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:57,120
but on a different identity.

1521
01:45:57,480 --> 01:46:00,360
When police were looking for him,
I received an intel, that,

1522
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:03,920
he was abducted
by Varman’s goons.

1523
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:08,320
We found out that, he was held
somewhere in Varman’s home town.

1524
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:10,880
Their plan was to kill him.

1525
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:32,600
Fuckers…

1526
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:33,680
Shakeel…

1527
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:38,000
My men saved his life…

1528
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:41,000
After this incident,
Varman was livid.

1529
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:44,560
He had only one
route left to tag Ishan…

1530
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:47,360
as "Maoist Ishan".

1531
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:50,960
You will be killed by the cops,
if you try to escape.

1532
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:52,960
And they will be the heroes.

1533
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,320
We never force anyone to join us.

1534
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:57,880
He was free to walk out.

1535
01:46:58,440 --> 01:46:59,920
But he was left with no choice.

1536
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:00,840
Listen…

1537
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:02,800
Listen to me…

1538
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:05,640
I did exactly, what I do
with every new comrade…

1539
01:47:05,720 --> 01:47:07,120
Do you believe in justice?

1540
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:09,680
I got him a new identity,
a new passport…

1541
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:11,760
So, you brainwashed him…

1542
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:13,400
… influenced him…

1543
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:17,560
Yes, just like media
has been doing for ages.

1544
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,120
Influence.

1545
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:24,120
No point beating around the bush.

1546
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:28,720
Everyone has their
own definition of Justice.

1547
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:34,560
I gave him an offer...

1548
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:38,360
… an offer to live a dignified life.

1549
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:44,680
From here, a simple ‘missing’ story,
became newsworthy for you.

1550
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:49,240
I know…

1551
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:53,680
you want to fight for justice…

1552
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,120
but power is…

1553
01:47:57,640 --> 01:47:59,280
...under the CM's foot...

1554
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:03,720
poor people forget everything
in the garb of caste politics.

1555
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:07,320
We forgive our leaders easily.

1556
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,520
I have a request.

1557
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:14,320
Will you please ask Ishan
to return to his family?

1558
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:16,760
And who will guarantee his safety?

1559
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:21,120
In these circumstances, can
any Ishan return home easily?

1560
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,360
Till we have leaders like Varman,

1561
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:28,840
‘Ishans’ of this world
will remain ‘Lost’.

1562
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:31,760
Last question…

1563
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:36,520
You offered Ishan
to live a dignified life?

1564
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,800
What did it mean?

1565
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:41,280
I can’t answer that…

1566
01:48:42,360 --> 01:48:43,880
It’s for you to probe.

1567
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:13,840
Namita?

1568
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:16,880
Ishan is no one to us...

1569
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:19,920
You have no son...

1570
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:22,720
I have no brother...

1571
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:27,520
He can't be my brother...

1572
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:30,520
He can't be my brother...

1573
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:34,120
Kunal Da, we’ll have to...

1574
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:35,880
... withdraw the story.

1575
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:38,560
I am just...

1576
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:40,840
... just going to rewrite again.

1577
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:43,720
I am really sorry.

1578
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:46,160
I am sorry...

1579
01:50:04,160 --> 01:50:05,120
'Ankita...'

1580
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:06,880
'listen to me carefully...'

1581
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:10,240
'A terrorist plot is being hatched to
assassinate you and Mr. Varman.'

1582
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:19,600
Sir...

1583
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:26,080
'Ankita...'

1584
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:27,800
'listen to me carefully...'

1585
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:31,720
'A terrorist plot is bei      ng hatched to
assassinate you and Mr. Varman.'

1586
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:34,240
'On your return journey
from his ancestral village...'

1587
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:37,080
'Please protect yourself.'

1588
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:39,640
'God willing, we will meet again.'

1589
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:49,320
Pandit...

1590
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:53,880
Ankita and I are staying
back for one more day.

1591
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:56,560
You may leave tonight, with
others, as per our schedule.

1592
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:57,160
Yes sir.

1593
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:58,280
Your wife is expecting...

1594
01:50:58,520 --> 01:50:59,120
Yes sir.

1595
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:01,040
I will see you in office
in a couple of days.

1596
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:01,880
Okay sir.

1597
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:49,400
'The convoy of Ranjan Varman,'

1598
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:51,560
'Urban Development Minister
of West Bengal,'

1599
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:54,840
'has been attacked by
suspected Maoist rebels.'

1600
01:51:55,120 --> 01:51:56,280
'Preliminary reports say,'

1601
01:51:56,360 --> 01:51:58,640
'that an explosion rocked
the Chenapetti village road,'

1602
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,920
'in Purulia district...'

1603
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:01,680
'... when the minister
was passing through.'

1604
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:05,200
'A car in the convoy, went up in flames,
witnesses claimed.'

1605
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:09,560
'The car, a white SUV, is said
to be Varman’s official vehicle,'

1606
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:12,400
'in which he was supposed to
be travelling back to Kolkata,'

1607
01:52:12,520 --> 01:52:13,680
'from his ancestral village,'

1608
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:15,760
'near the Bengal-Jharkand border.'

'recently elected councillor

1611
01:52:19,640 --> 01:52:22,720
'was also said to be travelling
back with the Minister.'

1612
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:26,160
'Details about casualties and injuries,
are awaited in what'

1613
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:28,080
'appears to be, a landmine blast.'

1614
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:30,400
'Let us listen in, to the local SDPO.'

1615
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:31,240
'We hear that,'

1616
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:34,000
'a local Maoist group has claimed
the responsibility for the blast.'

1617
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:54,080
Ishan turned into...

1618
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:59,320
... exactly what they claimed
he would become.

1619
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:04,120
I lost...

1620
01:53:17,240 --> 01:53:20,440
The world doesn't function
according to our whims,

1621
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:24,520
...neither do we follow
the dictates of nature.

1622
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:28,640
The equation may look strange...

1623
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:30,920
but it is what it is...

1624
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:35,480
...laugh with it...

1625
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:37,560
or accept it.

1626
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:43,240
Just do your work...

1627
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:46,520
don't think about results.

1628
01:54:24,760 --> 01:54:27,360
Mr. Varman, how did you
escape this attack?

1629
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:29,480
Whom do you suspect
in this attack?

1630
01:54:29,560 --> 01:54:31,720
Don’t you think this
was pre-planned?

1631
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:35,080
- Is Bhishm Rana involved in this?

1632
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:39,240
I was their prime target.

1633
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:41,880
- Bhishm Rana wanted
to eliminate me.

1634
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:44,640
- Ishan was a pawn in this game.

1635
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,880
- I pray to the Almighty...

1636
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:52,120
- who protected me to prevent
these youngsters from getting entrapped.

1637
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:55,760
- When did you learn
about this bomb blast?

1638
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:14,000
- With very heavy heart,

1639
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:15,960
- I announce, four of
my companions perished.

1640
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:18,800
- Amongst the deceased, I have lost
my most trusted personnel.

1641
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:21,600
I pray for their souls.

1642
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:25,800
And please note, their families
will have my full support.

1643
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:37,200
'A terrorist plot is being hatched to
assassinate Mr. Varman and you,'

1644
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:39,880
'on your return journey
from his ancestral village...'

1645
01:55:41,040 --> 01:55:42,400
'... please protect yourself.'

1646
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:45,800
'God willing,
we will meet again.'

1647
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:06,400
'Ankita,'

1648
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:08,200
'listen carefully,'

1649
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:11,400
'A terrorist plot is being hatched to
assassinate you and Mr. Varman...'

1650
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:14,160
'on your return journey
from his ancestral village...'

1651
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:16,440
'... please protect yourself.'

1652
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:18,960
'God willing,
we will meet again.'

1653
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:32,040
'Sometimes, when the dark
clouds cover the moon,'

1654
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:35,200
'... creating darkness all around us.'

1655
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:39,120
'We lose all our hope,
and we feel defeated in life.'

1656
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:46,360
'Had Ankita not shared,
Ishan’s warning video,'

1657
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:50,000
'we would have
misunderstood him...'

1658
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:54,320
'A day after the attack,
Namita received a letter...'

1659
01:56:55,520 --> 01:56:56,560
'from Ishan,'

1660
01:56:57,440 --> 01:57:01,520
'He said, he escaped
the clutches of Rana.'

1661
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:05,240
'He had not fallen victim to
vendetta politics,'

1662
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:07,000
'nor violent propaganda.'

1663
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:10,040
'He harbored no
hatred for Ankita either.'

1664
01:57:10,120 --> 01:57:10,920
Hello...

1665
01:57:11,240 --> 01:57:12,040
Vidhi...

1666
01:57:12,680 --> 01:57:14,560
don’t skip your meals...

1667
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:17,400
Yes mom.

1668
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:19,080
Bye.

1669
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:27,440
'Ishan realized,'

1670
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:29,440
'rebels, politicians,’

1671
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:31,840
'political parties, every outfit...'

1672
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:35,360
'... only work towards
their own ends.'

1673
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:38,920
'Life of a common man,
mean nothing to them.'

1674
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:42,600
'He also wrote,'

1675
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:45,600
'someday he will
return to his family.'

1676
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:55,360
'It seemed like a ray of hope,
poured in through the window,'

1677
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:59,560
'moon-light was peaking
through clouds...'

1678
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:01,800
'illuminating the darkness around us.'

1679
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:05,360
'Bright and pure rays of light,'

1680
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,080
'that instills faith in our lives.'

1681
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:11,920
'Making people believe
in good deeds.'

1682
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:16,240
'Best wishes to you all and...'

1683
01:58:16,920 --> 01:58:18,080
'let truth prevail.'

1684
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:26,960
"Finally, there is
brightness around me."

1685
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:37,360
"This newly found radiance."

1686
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:43,440
"Every tender buds hope...

1687
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:48,080
...to flower someday."

1688
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:53,200
"Like there is light..."

1689
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:57,920
"...at the end of every tunnel."

1690
01:58:58,280 --> 01:59:00,160
"In sunlight...

1691
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:03,240
"In the cool shades..."

1692
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:08,120
"There is brightness
all around us."

1693
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:10,560
"There is brightness..."

1694
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:18,040
"... in the depth of our hearts."

1695
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:25,320
"Open your eyes,"

1696
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:30,800
"speak lovingly..."

1697
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:45,720
"... you will experience this
brightness within yourself."

1698
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:20,040
"This brightness, has illuminated
a new path for us."

1699
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:30,120
"This new world is lit up so bright."

1700
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:40,560
"There is happiness,
in the chirping of birds"

1701
02:00:41,080 --> 02:00:50,760
"This brightness keeps us going."

1702
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,080
"Every path we take,"

1703
02:00:53,520 --> 02:01:00,560
"we will find this
brightness of positivity."

1704
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:05,640
"Wherever you go,
you will find this brightness."

1705
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:11,000
"You will find light all around you."

1706
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:18,000
"Open your eyes,"

brightness within yourself."
